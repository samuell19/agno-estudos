WHAT WILL I DO IF SOMETHING COMES UP? SETTLE IT YOURSELF. WHAT HAVE I GOT A LAWYER FOR? IS JULIA GOING WITH YOU? NO. WHAT IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY? I'VE LEFT INSTRUCTIONS WITH JULIA. SHE'LL GET IT FROM YOU. YOU DON'T TELL ME A THING. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING, WHEN YOU'RE COMING BACK, OR HOW TO REACH YOU IF ANY BUSINESS COMES UP! HELLO, TANNER. MR. WYNANT. MY DAUGHTER'S GOING TO BE MARRIED, TANNER. NICE YOUNG MAN. SHE JUST BROUGHT HIM IN. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. I'M GOING TO MAKE HER A WEDDING PRESENT. THOUGHT I'D BETTER DO IT NOW BEFORE I FORGET IT.

SEE YOU LATER, JOE. SORRY. DIDN'T KNOW I WAS TALKING TO THE BOYFRIEND. SO LONG. SO LONG, JOE. WHO'S THAT MAN? HE ISN'T ANYBODY, JUST A FELLOW I USED TO KNOW. I THOUGHT YOU'D GIVEN UP THAT SORT OF FRIEND. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM IN YEARS. I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK I WAS HIGH-HATTING HIM. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING. DON'T WORRY. YOU WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN. TELL ME, DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT GOING? NO. I JUST CAME BACK FOR A SECOND. I WANT TO GET THOSE... BONDS. BONDS? WHAT BONDS? THE GOVERNMENT BONDS, THE ONES YOU TOOK FROM THE OFFICE SAFE. OH, YES. YOU TOLD ME TO SELL THOSE A LONG TIME AGO. I'D NEVER TELL YOU TO SELL THOSE. I BOUGHT THOSE FOR MY DAUGHTER. BUT DON'T YOU REMEMBER-- NOW, SEE HERE, JULIA, YOU'RE COUNTING TOO MUCH ON MY ABSENT-MINDEDNESS. YOU'VE BEEN TAKING A LITTLE HERE AND THERE FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT MY SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT THIS IS $50,000. DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF-- NO ONE ELSE HAD THE COMBINATION TO THAT SAFE. YOU TOOK THEM. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM? WHAT IF I DID TAKE THEM? I'M SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING YOU HAND OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO YOUR FAMILY, SUPPORTING A GANG OF LOAFERS THAT DON'T CARE A DARN ABOUT YOU, A WIFE THAT KICKED YOU OUT THE FIRST TIME YOUR FOOT SLIPPED. NOT ONE WOULD RAISE A HAND TO HELP YOU, AND I'VE GIVEN MY WHOLE LIFE TO YOU. IF YOU KICKED OFF TOMORROW, WHERE WOULD I BE? OUT IN THE GUTTER. I TOOK THOSE BONDS. WHO HAS A BETTER RIGHT? I WANT THAT MONEY, OR I'LL HAND YOU OVER TO THE POLICE. GO AHEAD. THEY'LL BE PRETTY ROUGH WITH YOU...WITH YOUR RECORD. THAT'S A FINE THING TO SAY AFTER WHAT I'VE BEEN TO YOU. HELLO. GIVE ME-- WELL? ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. 25,000-- THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT. YOU'RE GOING TO RETURN EVERY CENT OF IT. I CAN'T. I HAVEN'T GOT IT. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE REST? I NEVER HAD IT. THEN THERE WAS SOMEONE IN WITH YOU. WHO WAS IT? I'LL ANSWER THAT. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO! HELLO! YOU DON'T NEED TO TELL ME. I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? STOP WORRYING ABOUT YOUR FATHER. HE'LL TURN UP ALL RIGHT. YES, BUT, TOMMY, TODAY'S CHRISTMAS EVE. HE'S JUST FORGOTTEN. YOU KNOW HOW HE FORGETS EVERYTHING. NO. HE NEVER FORGETS A PROMISE TO ME. I'M WORRIED, TOMMY. I KNOW SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HIM. WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM, DARLING? NOW, WILL YOU STOP WORRYING? YOU SEE, THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE RHYTHM. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE RHYTHM IN YOUR SHAKING. NOW, A MANHATTAN YOU SHAKE TO FOX-TROT TIME, A BRONX TO TWO-STEP TIME. THE DRY MARTINI YOU ALWAYS SHAKE TO WALTZ TIME. OH! MMM! WHAT IS IT? JUST A MINUTE. NOW, MIND YOU, THERE'S A STILL MORE MODERN TREND IN-- HERE. LET ME HAVE-- THANK YOU. CERTAIN PEOPLE-- HELLO THERE. HELLO. ANOTHER GLASS. HOW ARE YOU? YOU KNOW, WE DO KNOW EACH OTHER.

ALL RIGHT, GIRLS. OH, YES. COME ON. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU GAVE HER MONEY FOR WYNANT? YESTERDAY. I GAVE HER $1,000. ANY SIGNS OF THAT, BILL? NO. PERHAPS IT WAS A ROBBERY. HER WITH THAT SPARKLER ON HER FINGER AND $30 IN HER PURSE? IT LOOKS LIKE OUR FRIEND WYNANT CAME TO COLLECT AND RAN INTO A LITTLE TROUBLE. DOWNSTAIRS THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN THREE MONTHS. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THEY DON'T SEE HERE. YOU SAY YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM IN THAT TIME? I SAID HE HADN'T WRITTEN ME. THEN YOU HAVE HEARD FROM HIM. HE TELEPHONED ME TODAY. I WASN'T IN. MY SECRETARY TOOK THE MESSAGE. HE LEFT WORD FOR ME TO MEET HIM AT THE PLAZA. WHAT TIME? ABOUT 3:00. DID YOU GO? YES. HE DIDN'T SHOW. HIS HOUSE AND SHOP IS CLOSED, AND HE AIN'T AT ANY HOTEL. SO YOU SEEN YOUR DUTY, AND YOU DONE IT, HUH? YOU GONNA STOP AT THAT? NO, SIR. HE'LL TURN UP WHEN HE SEES THIS IN THE PAPERS. YOU CAN'T THINK HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY FOUGHT ABOUT THAT NIGHT HE WENT AWAY? I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD A FIGHT. WELL, THANKS. WE'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU WHEN WE NEED YOU AGAIN. I MAY GO? YEAH, GO AHEAD. MR. GUILD, COME HERE. HERE'S SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING. HMM... AND THERE SHE WAS, LYING ON THE FLOOR DEAD. THE POLICE SAID THAT SHE'D BEEN KILLED ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE I GOT THERE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T GOING THERE. DID THEY FIND ANY CLUES? A GUN, FINGERPRINTS? NOT A THING. WAS THERE MUCH BLOOD? GILBERT, DON'T BE SO HORRIBLE! NONSENSE. SHE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED. DID YOU KILL HER? YOU HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD MOTIVE. DON'T TALK LIKE THAT WHEN THE POLICE GET HERE. YOU SAID THEY'D FINISHED WITH YOU. THEY'D FINISHED FOR THE PRESENT. I'VE GOT MY ALIBI. I WAS AT THE LIBRARY. WHERE WERE YOU? CHILDREN, I WANT TO SPEAK TO CHRIS ALONE. WELL, I'LL GO. I'LL BE IN MY ROOM. IS MRS. JORGENSON IN? YES. COME RIGHT IN. OH, MRS.

DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN MISS WOLF'S HAND? OH, NO. ARE YOU SURE THAT AT NO TIME YOU LEFT THE ROOM FOR A MOMENT, THAT A MAID OR BELLBOY MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED IN THERE AND BEEN ALONE WITH THE BODY? I DON'T THINK SO. I WAS SO UPSET, I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SEEMS TO THINK THAT, UH... THAT THE BODY HAD BEEN TOUCHED, THAT SOMEONE HAD FORCED OPEN THE GIRL'S HAND AFTER SHE'D BEEN KILLED. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT SHE HAD IN HER POSSESSION $1,000 THE NIGHT BEFORE. I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU. HMM... WELL, THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE GOING ALONG. THANK YOU. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. COULD I COME DOWN AND SEE THE BODY? I'VE NEVER SEEN A DEAD BODY. WHY DO YOU WANT TO? I'VE BEEN STUDYING PSYCHOPATHIC CRIMINOLOGY, AND I HAVE A THEORY. PERHAPS THIS WAS THE WORK OF A SADIST OR A PARANOIAC. IF I SAW IT, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, BUT DON'T BOTHER TO COME DOWN. WE'LL BRING THE BODY RIGHT UP TO YOU. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU TOOK THAT MONEY FROM HER HAND. I DIDN'T. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? EVIDENCE THAT'S WORTH A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THAT. HAND THAT OVER TO THE POLICE. I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT. VERY WELL. I WILL. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL. IT'S YOUR FATHER'S.

THEN JUST SAY THAT HE WAS 60 YEARS OLD. IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS? OF COURSE. HEY, THAT'S MY HAT. COME AND GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT. COME ON. GIVE US A BREAK. I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. TELEPHONE, NICKY. TELEPHONE. OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOOR. HELLO? MR. CHARLES, I'D LIKE TO LAY A PROPOSITION BEFORE YOU. WELL, I CAN'T DISCUSS IT OVER THE TELEPHONE, BUT IF YOU'LL GIVE ME A HALF-HOUR OF YOUR TIME... YEAH. IT'S ABOUT JULIA WOLF. HELLO? HELLO? WHAT IS IT? AW...SOME GUY TRYING TO SELL ME INSURANCE. WHERE'S MISS WYNANT? WHY, SHE'S GONE. WHICH WAY DID SHE GO? SHE WENT OUT THE BACK DOOR. YOU MEAN THE LITTLE BRUNETTE? YES. OH, I'M SORRY, OLD FELLOW. THANKS. I'M ENGAGED FOR THIS ONE. WAIT. NO. DON'T DO THAT. I WANT TO TALK TO MA. SO YOU THINK YOU'RE A FIGHTER, EH? HA! SO WHAT? SO LISTEN, WORM! OH, NICKY... I LOVE YOU, BECAUSE YOU KNOW SUCH LOVELY PEOPLE. NICK. NICKY. WHAT? YOU ASLEEP? YES. GOOD. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. WELL, THAT'S JOLLY. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO DO A LITTLE DETECTING ONCE IN A WHILE JUST FOR FUN? CAN'T YOU GET TO SLEEP? NO. MAYBE IF YOU TOOK A DRINK, IT'D HELP YOU. NO, THANKS. MAYBE IT'D HELP IF I TOOK IT. EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE A GRAND DETECTIVE. WELL, THEY WERE KIDDING YOU. I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU WORK. TOMORROW MORNING, I'LL GET YOU A WHOLE LOT OF DETECTIVE STORIES. I KNOW, BUT THAT GIRL'S IN A TOUGH SPOT. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO HELP HER. SHE THINKS YOU CAN. WOULDN'T HURT YOU TO TRY AND SEE IF YOU COULD. WELL, DARLING, MY GUESS IS... WYNANT KILLED JULIA AND THAT DOROTHY KNOWS ABOUT IT. POLICE WILL CATCH HIM WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME. I THINK I WOULD LIKE THAT DRINK. HA HA... MY DARLING. I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT NOW IF YOU'LL GIVE ME MINE. AT BREAKFAST. WELL, IT'S CHRISTMAS NOW. UH... BREAKFAST. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME? I HOPE I DON'T LIKE IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE THE MAN AT THE AQUARIUM SAID HE WOULDN'T TAKE THEM BACK. DID YOU HEAR A KNOCK? YES. WELL, IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING IMPORTANT. WELL, SURE, IT IS. MR. CHARLES HERE? YES. I GOT TO TALK TO HIM. THAT'S ALL, BUT I GOT TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT. COME IN. YOU WAIT HERE. I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE HERE. AARR... WHAT IN THE NAME OF-- SOMEONE TO SEE YOU, DEAR. GOOD. I WAS AFRAID I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP. GET OUT OF THAT BED. LET ME STRAIGHTEN THIS UP. YOU'RE WORSE THAN AN INFANT. FUNNY. I THINK THOSE BLANKETS MUST BE A LITTLE COCKEYED. RIGHT, ASTA? THERE. YOU'VE GOT THE FUNNIEST LOOK ON YOUR FACE I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE. HURRY UP. THAT MAN'S WAITING FOR YOU. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME SOMETHING. GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT. GET ME? WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING THAT GUN AWAY? MY WIFE DOESN'T CARE, BUT I'M A TIMID FELLOW. YOU IDIOT. ASTA! ASTA, COME HERE. ALL RIGHT, SHOOT-- I MEAN, UH... WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME YOU'RE TOUGH. I HEARD ABOUT YOU. I'M JOE MORELLI. I NEVER HEARD ABOUT YOU. I DIDN'T KNOCK JULIA OFF. ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T. I AIN'T SEEN HER IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS. WE WAS ALL WASHED UP. I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO HURT HER. SHE WAS ALWAYS ON THE UP AND UP WITH ME, BUT THAT DIRTY LITTLE NUNHEIM GOT SORE WITH HER BECAUSE I CLICKED AND HE DIDN'T, AND HE PUT THE FINGER ON ME. THIS IS ALL SWELL, BROTHER, BUT YOU'RE PEDDLING YOUR FISH IN THE WRONG MARKET. STUTSY BURKE SAYS YOU USED TO BE OK. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. HOW IS STUTSY? I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS OUT OF STIR. HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU. WHAT'S THE LAW DOING TO ME? DO THEY THINK I DID IT? OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE TO PIN ON ME? IF I KNEW, I'D TELL YOU. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. ASK THE POLICE. THAT WOULD BE THE SMARTEST THING I EVER DID-- THE POLICE CAPTAIN'S BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL 3 WEEKS ON ACCOUNT OF WE HAD AN ARGUMENT. THE BOYS WOULD LIKE THAT DOWN TO THEIR BLACKJACKS. STUTSY SAYS YOU'RE ON THE LEVEL. WHY DON'T YOU BE ON THE LEVEL? I AM ON THE LEVEL. IF I KNEW ANYTHING-- WHAT'S THAT? I DON'T KNOW. THAT MAKES THIS YOUR PARTY. OPEN UP! POLICE! WHY, YOU TWO-TIMING-- TAKE HIM, BOB. NORA. NORA. NORA. SAY, GIVE ME THAT BOTTLE, WILL YOU? WHAT KNOCKED HER OUT? I DID. SHE WAS IN THE LINE OF FIRE. SOMEBODY CALL A DOCTOR, WILL YOU? HERE, BABY. HELP ME UP ON THE BED WITH HER. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU DARN FOOL! YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOCK ME OUT. I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HIM. I WANTED TO SEE YOU DO IT. THERE'S A GIRL WITH HAIR ON HER CHEST. NICKY, ARE YOU HURT? NO. HE JUST GRAZED ME. YOU ARE! SOMEBODY GET A DOCTOR. THERE'S ONE CALLED ALREADY. GET INTO BED. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SURE. I CAN'T EVEN FEEL IT. I'LL GET SOME TOWELS. HMM. PRETTY CLOSE. HAVE A SHOT, WILL YOU? HERE YOU ARE, BUT YOU'LL BE OK. TOUGH LUCK. AW, SHUT UP! HERE, DARLING. USE THIS. BABY, IT'S ONLY A SCRATCH. WANT A DRINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW DID YOU PEOPLE HAPPEN TO POP IN HERE? WE HEAR THIS IS A MEETING PLACE FOR THE WYNANT FAMILY. WE FIGURE WE'LL STICK AROUND IN CASE THE OLD BOY HIMSELF SHOULD SHOW UP. THEN WE SEE THIS BIRD SNEAK IN, AND WE DECIDE TO COME UP. LUCKY FOR YOU WE DID. YES. I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SHOT. YOU KNOW THIS MONKEY? THAT DIRTY LITTLE RAT NUNHEIM-- SHUT UP! IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS? I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE. WHAT DID HE WANT WITH YOU? HE WANTED TO TELL ME HE DIDN'T KILL JULIA WOLF. WHAT'S THAT TO YOU? NOTHING. WHAT DID HE THINK IT WAS TO YOU? ASK HIM. I'M ASKING YOU. KEEP ON ASKING. FRISK THE DUMP. NOT WITHOUT A WARRANT. SO YOU SAY. GO ON, BOB. TOUGH, HUH? CHARLES, WE'RE BOTH OF US GOING ABOUT THIS THING IN THE WRONG WAY. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOUGH WITH YOU, AND I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TOUGH WITH ME. THERE'S ONE MORE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU. ARE YOU WILLING TO SWEAR TO A COMPLAINT FOR THIS GUY'S PLUGGING YOU? THAT'S ANOTHER ONE I CAN'T ANSWER NOW. MAYBE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. WHAT'S THAT MAN DOING IN MY DRAWERS? HERE YOU ARE, LIEUTENANT. YOU GOT A PISTOL PERMIT? NO. EVER HEARD OF THE SULLIVAN ACT? OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE MARRIED. THIS GUN YOURS? NO. WHOSE IS IT? I'LL HAVE TO TRY TO REMEMBER. OK. WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME. I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN I FIGURED. WE'LL COME AROUND TOMORROW WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BETTER. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, BOYS. SAY, WHERE'S ASTA? ASTA? AS-- ASTA, COME HERE. HA! YOU'RE A FINE WATCHDOG. HE'S GOT MORE SENSE THAN YOU HAVE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT ON THIS CASE. ON IT? I'M IN IT. THEY THINK I DID IT. WELL, DIDN'T YOU? AH... WELL... I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED. HUH? WHERE AM I? YOU'RE NOT IN A SHOOTING GALLERY. AH, BUT, SUGAR, THIS IS THE NICEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT I'VE EVER HAD. YOU ACT AS THOUGH IT WERE THE ONLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT YOU EVER HAD. SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WRIST WATCH? IT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. YEAH? WHO GAVE IT TO YOU? YOU DID. WELL, YOU MUST ADMIT I'VE GOT PRETTY GOOD TASTE, HAVEN'T I? YOU FINISHED WITH THIS? YES. I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE MURDER AS THEY DO. OH, I'M A HERO. I WAS SHOT TWICE IN THE TRIBUNE. I READ WHERE YOU WERE SHOT FIVE TIMES IN THE TABLOIDS. IT'S NOT TRUE. HE DIDN'T COME ANYWHERE NEAR MY TABLOIDS. AH! BULL'S-EYE. HELLO? WHO IS IT? OH, SEND HIM RIGHT UP. WHO WAS THAT? MR. MacCAULAY. THE MALLORYS. OH, DEAR. I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM. AREN'T YOU HOT IN THAT? YES, I'M STIFLING, BUT IT'S SO PRETTY. THE KIRBYS. IS THAT ANOTHER CHRISTMAS PRESENT? MM-HMM. DID I GIVE IT TO YOU? YES. I'M SPOILING YOU. WHY, NICKY, THIS IS FROM CLYDE WYNANT. HE SAYS, "WILL YOU TAKE CHARGE "OF INVESTIGATION ON JULIA WOLF MURDER? COMMUNICATE WITH HERBERT MacCAULAY." LET ME SEE. WHERE'S IT FROM? PHILADELPHIA. THEN HE DIDN'T DO IT. I DON'T KNOW. HE WOULDN'T ASK YOU TO HANDLE IT IF HE WERE GUILTY, WOULD HE? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE, BABY. AW, NICKY, TAKE THE CASE. YOU TAKE IT. I'M TOO BUSY. HOW DO YOU DO? COME IN. GOOD MORNING. WELL, I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS FOR YOU. OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE YOU, MacCAULAY? OH, I'M FINE. YOU'RE COMING ALONG BETTER THAN I AM. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY HURT. NO. JUST A SCRATCH. I'VE FORGOTTEN IT. WHAT A DELIGHTFUL TOY. THAT'S ASTA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT. I GOT WORD FROM WYNANT THIS MORNING. SO DID WE-- I MEAN, SHERLOCK HERE. DARLING, WILL YOU, UH... PASS YOU YOUR DRINK? YES. HMM. THANK YOU. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING YOU TO DO WHAT HE WANTS? SLIM. WOULD IT HELP ANY IF I COULD PERSUADE HIM TO MEET YOU? IT MIGHT. HE GAVE ME A CODE MESSAGE TO INSERT IN THE TIMES IN CASE I WANTED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM. I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WOULD DO ANY HARM TO PUT IT IN. I'VE DONE THAT ALREADY. HE SHOULD APPEAR. IT DOESN'T LOOK WELL, HIS STAYING AWAY NOW. POLICE. FOR ME? HELLO? WHERE? ALLENTOWN? YES. WELL, WHEN IS THE NEXT TRAIN? RIGHT. I'LL GET THAT. WYNANT'S TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN AND IDENTIFY HIM. WELL, I GUESS THIS CHANGES THE WHOLE STORY, DOESN'T IT? THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT. AND I HAD SUCH HOPES. I THOUGHT IF YOU GOT ON THE CASE, YOU'D BE ABLE TO CLEAR HIM. I THOUGHT THAT MIMI-- THE WAY SHE ACTED, I WAS SURE THAT... OH, WELL. WELL, THERE'S NO USE THINKING ABOUT THAT NOW. I'M SORRY TO HAVE WASTED SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. GOOD-BYE. HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU. SAME TO YOU. GOOD-BYE. ASTA, IS YOUR BALLOON BUSTED? SO IS MINE. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? THE MYSTERY'S ALL GONE. I WAS HOPING YOU'D FIND OUT WHO DID IT. MAYBE I WILL. WELL, WYNANT-- I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID IT. WHY DON'T YOU? NO REASON. JUST A HUNCH. BUT I'M GOING TO FIND OUT. I'M TIRED OF BEING PUSHED AROUND. COME ON, DR. WATSON. LET'S GO PLACES. GOOD MORNING, NICK. WELL, IT'S NOT A VERY NICE TRICK YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL ON ME, RUNNING OUT LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS GIVING YOU TIME TO REST UP BEFORE I ASKED YOU THOSE QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE GUN? THAT NEVER WAS A GUN. DON'T WASTE TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT. MAN TO MAN, ARE YOU WORKING ON THIS CASE? MAN TO MAN, I'M NOT. BUT HE'S INTERESTED. I'D RATHER HAVE YOU WORKING WITH US THAN AGAINST US. THAT SUITS ME. IT'S A BARGAIN. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW? WHAT ABOUT THE SUICIDE? A PHONY. THE BOYS DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO DOWN. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. THEY'RE GOING TO THINK EVERY THIN MAN WITH WHITE HAIR IS WYNANT. YOU THINK WYNANT DID IT? I DON'T KNOW. HE CERTAINLY PLANNED SOMETHING. HE CLOSED UP HIS APARTMENT AND SHOP. WERE YOU THERE? YES, BUT I COULDN'T FIND A THING. I FIGURE WYNANT WENT TO JULIA'S APARTMENT AND FOUND MORELLI THERE, SEES SHE'S TWO-TIMING HIM. THERE'S A FIGHT. HE DOESN'T PULL ANYTHING THEN ON ACCOUNT OF MORELLI. LETS HIS LAWYER GIVE HER MONEY TO GIVE TO HIM SO THAT SHE'LL THINK IT'S ALL BLOWN OVER. WHEN SHE ISN'T EXPECTING IT, HE LETS HER HAVE IT. NO PROOF? NO, NOTHING AS YET TO CINCH IT. 50 WILL GET YOU 100, HE DIDN'T DO IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE WAS TOO ABSENT-MINDED TO HOLD A GRUDGE. WHO'S YOUR CANDIDATE? I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR YET, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT EVERYTHING POINTS TO WYNANT. WHAT ABOUT YOUR ALIBIS? THEY'RE ALL OK-- MRS. JORGENSON, THE BOY, DOROTHY, MacCAULAY, EVEN MORELLI. WE HAD TO LET HIM GO. WHAT ABOUT JORGENSON? I'LL CHECK ON THAT. MRS. CHARLES, THIS MUST BE DULL FOR YOU. DULL? I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY CHAIR. WHAT ABOUT NUNHEIM? HE'S ALL RIGHT. WE KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM. HE DOES A LITTLE STOOLING FOR US ONCE IN A WHILE. DID YOU KNOW THAT HE'D BEEN HANGING AROUND JULIA? NO. HOLDING OUT ON YOU. LET'S LOOK INTO THAT. TAXI! THIS MAY GET A BIT ROUGH, BABY. I THINK YOU BETTER LET US GO ALONE. CATCH ME LETTING YOU GO ALONE. GRANT'S TOMB. TAXI! WHO IS IT? JOHN. HELLO, LIEUTENANT. SIT DOWN, NICK. I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU, LIEUTENANT. YOU SAID YOU'D PHONE. HAVE A SHOT? WHAT'S THE IDEA TELLING ME YOU KNEW THE WOLF GIRL JUST BY SIGHT? THAT'S ALL I DID, LIEUTENANT. THAT'S THE GOD'S TRUTH. MAYBE I SAID HELLO TO HER OR "HOW ARE YOU?" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN I SAW HER, BUT THAT'S ALL I DID. THAT'S THE TRUTH. HA HA HA! HMPH! YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH, AND I'LL POP A TOOTH OUT OF IT. OH, IS THAT SO? YEAH! CUT IT OUT. CUT IT OUT! WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO WATCH YOU TWO ROUGHHOUSE. SHE'S DRIVING ME NUTS. SHE'S BEEN RAGGING ME ALL DAY. MAYBE IF YOU QUIT RUNNING AROUND AFTER OTHER WOMEN, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS ONE. NOW, THAT'S A LIE, LIEUTENANT. ANYBODY THAT SAYS THAT IS A LIAR. WANT TO TAKE A POKE AT HIM? I DIDN'T MEAN YOU, MISTER. COME ON. SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU NOW. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, A GUY KNOCKING AROUND. YOU'D HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT IN THE BEGINNING. WHERE WERE YOU THE AFTERNOON SHE WAS KNOCKED OFF? YOU DON'T THINK I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT! WHERE WERE YOU? MARION! WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T LIKE CROOKS, AND IF I DID LIKE THEM, I WOULDN'T LIKE CROOKS THAT ARE STOOL PIGEONS, AND IF I DID LIKE CROOKS THAT ARE STOOL PIGEONS, I STILL WOULDN'T LIKE YOU! MARION, DON'T GO! MARION! MARION, WAIT A MINUTE! I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY. I'LL BEHAVE! DON'T GO. LET ME GET AFTER HER. LET ME BRING HER BACK. I'LL DO ANYTHING. I'LL ANSWER ANYTHING YOU WANT. SIT DOWN. WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO WATCH YOU TWO DANCE AROUND THE MAYPOLE. WHERE WERE YOU THE AFTERNOON THAT GIRL WAS KILLED? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T REMEMBER. I CAN'T TELL YOU JUST OFFHAND. MAYBE I WAS DOWN AT CHARLIE'S SHOOTING POOL. MAYBE I WAS UP HERE. I DON'T KNOW. SHE'D REMEMBER. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THROWN IN THE CAN ON ACCOUNT OF NOT REMEMBERING? GIVE ME A MINUTE. I'LL REMEMBER. YOU KNOW I AIN'T STALLING. ALWAYS COME CLEAN WITH YOU. GEE. GEE, SURE. SURE. I--I REMEMBER. I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU THREW ME IN THE CAN. LOOK, I REMEMBER WHERE I WAS. THAT--THAT'S THE AFTERNOON-- WAIT A MINUTE. I'LL SHOW YOU. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT? WELL, I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WHO ARE YOU PHONING? I'M PHONING YOUR OFFICE SO THEY CAN SEND OUT A MAN TO TRAIL HIM. I WANT TO SEE WHERE HE GOES. TRAIL HIM? TRAIL WHO? NUNHEIM. GIVE ME THAT PHONE. GIVE ME THAT PHONE. BILL, PICK UP NUNHEIM. TELL THE BOYS. HE JUST LEFT HERE-- WENT DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE. COVER THE GRAND CENTRAL AND PENNSYLVANIA STATIONS. CHECK ALL AIRPORTS AND ALL STEAMSHIP TERMINALS. WHAT'S THAT? NO. HAVE LEFTY RADIO ALL THE CARS. HE WAS DRESSED IN A BLACK PAIR OF PANTS. HOW SHOULD I KNOW IF HIS UNDERWEAR'S EMBROIDERED? LISTEN, THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING ME AGAIN TODAY, SEE, ASKING ME WHAT MORE I KNOW, WHERE I WAS THAT DAY. WAIT A MINUTE. I DUCKED OUT ON THEM. LOOK, IF YOU WANT ME TO PLAY DUMB ANYMORE, I WANT 5,000 MORE. 5,000, AND I'LL BLOW TOWN TODAY. OK. WHERE? ALL RIGHT. RIGHT AWAY. SEE THAT YOU'RE THERE AND SEE THAT YOU BRING IT WITH YOU. AAH! "ARTHUR NUNHEIM, HONORARY MEMBER." NOPE, NOT A THING. FIND OUT ABOUT THAT BULLET YET? YES. IT'S THE SAME GUN THAT KILLED JULIA WOLF. AND HOW ARE YOUR FOLKS? HELLO? OH, HOW ARE YOU? NO, WE DIDN'T FIND A THING. YOUR WIFE. AND, LIEUTENANT, I'VE GOT SOMETHING. I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE DETECTING ON MY OWN. THAT FLATFOOT I MARRIED THINKS HE'S SMART, BUT I'M JUST ONE JUMP AHEAD OF HIM. THAT'S SWELL, MRS. CHARLES. HOW DID YOU LIKE GRANT'S TOMB? IT'S LOVELY. I'M HAVING A COPY MADE FOR YOU. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, BABY? I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU. OH. WE'LL BE RIGHT UP. SHE'S UP AT MIMI'S. JORGENSON HAS DISAPPEARED. CHRIS MAY BE AT THE CLUB. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM THAT HE DISAPPEARED. BUT HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THAT'S NOT FOR YOU TO DECIDE. EVERYBODY'S UNDER SUSPICION, ESPECIALLY RUNNING OFF LIKE THIS. THE POLICE ARE GOING TO WANT A DESCRIPTION OF HIM. IS THIS HIS PICTURE? HE DIDN'T DO IT! THEY'LL WANT MORE THAN YOUR WORD. I'LL TELL THEM WHO DID DO IT, AND I'LL GIVE THEM PROOF. DORIE. OH, TOMMY. PLEASE DON'T CRY. I CAN'T HELP IT. YOU DON'T KNOW. DARLING, YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH ANY MORE OF THIS. YOU GET TOGETHER SOME CLOTHES AND YOUR SKATES, AND WE'LL GO TO MY FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY. NO, I CAN'T. YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR MIND OFF ALL THIS. DARLING, YOU'VE BEEN SO SWEET, BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU COULD DO FOR ME, AND THAT IS TO GO AND NEVER SEE ME AGAIN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? PLEASE, YOU CAN'T GET MIXED UP IN THIS. DO YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT THAT? TOMMY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ALL I KNOW IS I WANT YOU TO MARRY ME. I CAN'T MARRY YOU. I CAN'T EVER MARRY YOU. DOROTHY! WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE MURDERERS FOR CHILDREN? THAT WOULD BE FUN, WOULDN'T IT? PERHAPS THEY'D ALL MURDER EACH OTHER AND KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT FATHER SHOULD HAVE DONE. HE SHOULD HAVE KILLED GILBERT AND ME. THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS TO GO THROUGH. YOU'RE TALKING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON. WHY NOT? I AM CRAZY. ALL OUR FAMILY'S CRAZY. DOROTHY, I LOVE YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? TOMMY! TOMMY! PLEASE GO. GO. SLEUTHING ISN'T MUCH FUN AFTER ALL, IS IT? I FEEL AWFULLY SORRY FOR THAT GIRL. FIND ANYTHING? SHE'S READY TO TALK. WOULDN'T DO ANY HARM, THOUGH, TO FIND OUT WHERE HE IS. YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ALL YOUR CHILDREN BEING MURDERERS. NOW, I'VE STUDIED THE MENDELIAN LAW OF INHERITANCE AND THEIR EXPERIMENTS WITH SWEET PEAS, AND ACCORDING TO THEIR FINDINGS-- AND THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY CONCLUSIVE-- ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR OF YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE A MURDERER. THE THING FOR YOU TO DO WOULD BE JUST TO HAVE THREE CHILDREN. NO, THAT MIGHT NOT WORK. THE FIRST ONE MIGHT BE THE BAD ONE. I'LL HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP. YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER ABOUT LOOKING THAT UP. I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED, I'M NOT HAVING ANY CHILDREN. FROM NOW ON, I'M JUST OUT FOR THE RIDE. I TOOK IT FROM HER HAND. IT WAS MR. WYNANT'S WATCH CHAIN. I WANTED TO PROTECT HIM. WELL, I GUESS THAT CINCHES IT, EH, CHARLES? HE KILLED THEM BOTH-- THE WOLF GIRL AND NUNHEIM. 50 WILL STILL GET YOU 100. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME. EXTRA! WYNANT'S EX-WIFE PRODUCES MURDER EVIDENCE! EXTRA! EXTRA! DOUBLE MURDER CHARGE AGAINST WYNANT! EXTRA! EXTRA! WYNANT WANTED IN SECOND MURDER! EXTRA! I WISH THEY'D STOP THAT. I WONDER IF THEY'LL FIND HIM. HE MUST BE IN NEW YORK. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I'M A-GONNA TAKE ASTA FOR A WALK. HE'S JUST BEEN. WELL, WE'RE GOING SIGHTSEEING. WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S KNOWN IN BURGLING CIRCLES AS A FLASHLIGHT. NICK, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? WHAT IS THIS? OOH! LOOKS LIKE A HOLDUP. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY WYNANT'S SHOP IS CLOSED. HE WENT AWAY, DIDN'T HE? HE WENT AWAY A LOT WHEN I KNEW HIM, BUT HE NEVER CLOSED THE SHOP. I GOT A HUNCH. DO YOU THINK HE'S HIDING THERE? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GOING TO FIND OUT. I WON'T HAVE YOU GOING DOWN THERE. HEY, YOU GOT ME INTO THIS. I KNOW, BUT HE'S A CRAZY MAN. HE MIGHT KILL YOU. HE WON'T KILL ME. I'VE GOT ASTA TO PROTECT ME. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. SEE IF I CARE. I THINK IT'S A DIRTY TRICK TO BRING ME TO NEW YORK TO MAKE A WIDOW OF ME. YOU WOULDN'T BE A WIDOW LONG... YOU BET I WOULDN'T. NOT WITH ALL YOUR MONEY. WELL, ANY PORT IN A STORM. GOOD-BYE, SUGAR. NICKY! NICKY! HUH? TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. OH, SURE I WILL. SAY IT AS IF YOU MEANT IT. WELL, I DO BELIEVE THE LITTLE WOMAN CARES. I DON'T CARE. IT'S JUST THAT I'M USED TO YOU, THAT'S ALL. IF YOU LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM, YOU'LL NEVER WAG THAT TAIL AGAIN. YOU SURE THIS IS THE PLACE? YEAH. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO WAIT, DO YOU? CERTAINLY. NOT AFRAID, ARE YOU? NO, I GUESS NOT. ALL RIGHT, ASTA. ASTA? COME ON, ASTA. ASTA? ASTA, YOU'RE NOT A TERRIER. YOU'RE A POLICE DOG. WHEW! NO, ASTA. NO, NO. ASTA, GET AWAY FROM THERE. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. HELLO. LIEUTENANT GUILD, PLEASE. OH, JOHN? THIS IS NICK CHARLES. I'M UP IN WYNANT'S SHOP. WELL, I FOUND SOMETHING. IT'S A BODY. STICK 'EM UP! TURN AROUND. DON'T MAKE A MOVE, OR THAT DOG WILL TEAR YOU TO SHREDS. YOU CAN COME OUT. HE WON'T HURT YOU. UP TO YOUR OLD TRICKS, TANNER? YOU'RE MR. CHARLES, AREN'T YOU, SIR? YES. HOW DID YOU GET IN? I HAVE A KEY. I WORKED HERE, TILL THEY CLOSED IT. YOU WORKED HERE? YES. JULIA WOLF GOT ME A BOOKKEEPER JOB. WELL, THAT'S A HOT ONE. WHERE DID YOU EVER LEARN BOOKKEEPING? THAT LAST TIME YOU SENT ME UP, I LEARNED BOOKKEEPING IN SING SING. I FIGURED IT WOULD BE AN IN FOR ME SOMEWHERES. SOMEWHERES WHERE THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE SAFE OPEN. HONEST, MR. CHARLES, I NEVER TOUCHED THAT SAFE. THEM BONDS THAT WAS MISSING-- JULIA WOLF TOOK THEM. TRYING TO PUT IT OFF ON HER, HUH? SHE DID. THAT'S WHY HE GOT SORE AT HER AND KILLED HER. LISTEN, CAN I TAKE MY HANDS DOWN? OK. I DID DO A BIT OF CHISELING. I COME TO BRING THE MONEY BACK AND FIX UP THE BOOKS. EASY! IT'S ALL RIGHT, MR. CHARLES. IT'S JUST A POCKETBOOK. I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO FIND OUT AND COME AFTER ME. SAVE THAT. TELL IT TO THE POLICE. POLICE? MOVE OVER, WILL YOU? HAVEN'T YOU GOT THAT YET? YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, WOULD YOU? NO, SIR. TAKE HIM DOWN TO CENTRAL. I'LL TALK TO HIM LATER. HMM. WONDER WHAT WYNANT HAD AGAINST THIS ONE. QUICKLIME. MIND IF I LOOK THESE OVER, DOC? NO. GO AHEAD. JUST ROLLED THEM UP AND THREW THEM IN. LUCKY THING FOR US THESE WEREN'T ENTIRELY EATEN UP. EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY. NO IDENTIFICATION. MUST HAVE WEIGHED 250 POUNDS IF AN OUNCE. HERE'S SOMETHING. HMM. RUBBER TIP. MUST HAVE BEEN LAME. WHO WOULDN'T BE, CARRYING ALL THAT WEIGHT AROUND? I SHOULD SAY HE STOOD ABOUT 5'11", WOULDN'T YOU, DOC? YEAH, ABOUT. "D.W.R." "R." SAY, THAT CASE YOU WORKED ON, THAT MAN WHO THREATENED TO KILL WYNANT-- WHAT WAS HIS NAME? ROSEBREEN. SAY, COULD THIS BE THE MAN? I NEVER SAW HIM. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EVER SAW HIM. HE THREATENED TO KILL WYNANT ON ACCOUNT OF SOME INVENTION HE'D STOLEN, RIGHT? YES. WE FIGURED THAT WAS JUST BLACKMAIL. HE STILL WOULDN'T MIND GETTING RID OF HIM, WOULD HE? DOC, HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY THIS BODY HAD BEEN HERE? CAN'T SAY OFFHAND. AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MONTHS. A COUPLE OF MONTHS? THAT'S JUST WHEN WYNANT CLOSED THE SHOP! IT'S AN OPEN BOOK. WYNANT KILLED THIS GUY AND PLANTED HIM HERE. JULIA KNEW ABOUT IT, SO HE KILLED HER, AND NUNHEIM CAUGHT HIM AT THAT, SO HE BUMPED HIM OFF. WELL, BOYS, I GUESS WE'LL BE GOING. NICK, YOU DID A SWELL JOB. YOU WOULDN'T MIND PAYING ME THAT $100 NOW, WOULD YOU? WAIT TILL YOU CATCH WYNANT. HA HA! I'LL GET HIM, ALL RIGHT! BRING THAT STUFF OUT TO THE CAR. YOU GOING TO RUN HIM THROUGH THE POLARISCOPE? YES. YOU MIND IF I COME SEE IT? I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THAT BODY. STEP RIGHT OVER HERE, MR. CHARLES. THERE'S THE BULLET HE WAS KILLED WITH. SEE? HMM.

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. CAN'T YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CASE? YES. IT'S PUTTING ME BEHIND IN MY DRINKING. LET'S GET THIS IN. WHAT'S YOUR NEXT STEP, NICK? BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO REST UP FROM THIS VACATION. WE'LL SEE YOU BEFORE YOU GO. GOOD-BYE, BOYS. GOOD-BYE. BACK TO CALIFORNIA, HUH? MY SOUL, WOMAN. I GIVE YOU THREE MURDERS, AND YOU'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED. OH! WELL, IF YOU INSIST. WELL, I DON'T INSIST. NO, I WANTED YOU TO STAY HERE AND FIND WYNANT. I DID FIND HIM. HE WAS DOWN IN HIS SHOP. NICK! THAT WAS HIS BODY THAT WAS DOWN THERE. DARLING, YOU'D BETTER LAY OFF THAT LIQUOR. WELL, THAT'S A FACT. WYNANT'S BODY? YEP. SAY, DON'T YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS ROSEBREEN. THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK-- GUILD AND THE REST OF THEM. THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED IT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF WYNANT'S VICTIMS. GUILD'S OUT LOOKING FOR WYNANT. THAT'S ALL THAT TROUBLES HIM. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE IT WAS WYNANT'S BODY? WELL... SEVERAL THINGS. OH, HELLO. FRED? WE'RE HUNGRY AGAIN. HA HA! AND LOTS OF ONIONS. OH, AND, UH, COFFEE. YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY. WHAT THINGS? HMM?

WHOEVER KILLED HIM WAS COUNTING ON ONE THING-- THAT SKELETONS ALL LOOK ALIKE. WELL, THEY DO, DON'T THEY? SURE. YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANOTHER SWALLOW UNTIL YOU OPEN UP. I REMEMBER THAT WYNANT HAD SHRAPNEL IN HIS SHIN. IT USED TO BOTHER HIM. I LOOKED FOR IT AND FOUND IT. HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DEAD? A COUPLE OF MONTHS. OH, THEN HE COULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED THOSE MURDERS. SMART GAL. WYNANT DEAD. DOES DOROTHY KNOW? NO. NOBODY KNOWS BUT YOU. I'M GOING TO TELL HER. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SHE'S GOING CRAZY. SHE'D RATHER KNOW HE WAS DEAD THAN-- I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

WE'RE HERE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT NEWS. WHAT IS IT? JUST THIS. CLYDE WYNANT DID NOT KILL JULIA, NUNHEIM, OR ANYONE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S IN THE PAPERS. HE DIDN'T KILL THEM? WHAT DID I TELL YOU? I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT. I KNEW THEY'D PULL SOMETHING. IF YOU GOT MONEY, YOU CAN GET BY WITH ANYTHING. QUIET! LET HIM HAVE HIS SAY. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT, NICK? I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT. WHERE? THAT'S NOTHING. I SAW HIM MYSELF. I TOLD YOU. IT'S A FRAME-UP. WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM? LAST NIGHT, IN MY APARTMENT. IS THAT SO? WHAT DID HE SAY? HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW I WAS AND HOW THE CHILDREN WERE. WHAT WAS HE WEARING? UH, BROWN SUIT, BROWN SHOES, A WHITE SHIRT, A GRAYISH TIE WITH REDDISH-BROWN OR BROWNISH-RED DOTS IN IT. TELL THE MEN. I SAW HIM, TOO, WEARING A GREEN SUIT. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE. I KNOW, BUT I SAW HIM. WHERE? I WAS GAZING IN MY CRYSTAL. OHH! WAITER, WILL YOU SERVE THE NUTS? I MEAN, WILL YOU SERVE THE GUESTS THE NUTS? MIMI, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE LYING. I REALLY DID SEE WYNANT LAST NIGHT. ARE YOU KIDDING? WHAT'S THE IDEA OF HOLDING OUT ON ME? YOU SAW HIM YOURSELF. THAT WAS HIS BODY BURIED IN THE SHOP. NICK! DOROTHY, IT'S TERRIBLE TO TELL YOU THIS WAY, BUT YOUR FATHER IS DEAD. HE'S BEEN DEAD THREE MONTHS. I'M TERRIBLY-- YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR COAT. OH, DARLING, PLEASE DON'T CRY. IT'S TERRIBLE, I KNOW, BUT ISN'T IT BETTER THAT WAY? I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER. UH, TOMMY... TOMMY, YOU SIT HERE. WAITER, WILL YOU KINDLY REMOVE THAT? WHAT? NO ONE EATING? AH! MIMI, I SEE IT HASN'T AFFECTED YOUR APPETITE. BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. WHAT'S YOUR PROOF? A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL IN HIS SHIN. IF HE DIDN'T DO IT, WHO DID? THE MURDERER IS RIGHT IN THIS ROOM, SITTING AT THIS TABLE. YOU MAY SERVE THE FISH. EAT SOMETHING, YOU FOOL. WON'T YOU TELL US WHO? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT IF WE HAD A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER, WE MIGHT FIND OUT. NICE FOOD, ISN'T IT? YES. IT'S THE BEST DINNER I EVER LISTENED TO. WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT? MORELLI. YOU CAN'T PIN THIS ON ME! WHAT AM I, THE FALL GUY? SIT DOWN! I ONLY WANT TO ASK A QUESTION. MORELLI, YOU KNEW JULIA. YEAH. WAS SHE GYPPING WYNANT? SHE DON'T SAY. I FIGURE SHE IS. WHY'S THAT? I WANTED 5 GRAND. SHE GAVE ME CASH. THANKS. THREE MONTHS AGO-- THE NIGHT THAT WYNANT CAUGHT YOU IN JULIA'S APARTMENT, MORELLI-- HE DISCOVERED JULIA WAS CHEATING ON HIM AND SPLITTING IT WITH SOME MAN. THAT MAN WAS...TANNER. OH, I'M SO SORRY, TANNER. DON'T YOU WANT SOME WINE? NO. REALLY, MR. CHARLES, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. TANNER, SIT DOWN. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, TANNER. YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY. OH, NOW, LET ME SEE. WHERE WAS I? OH, YES. WYNANT WENT TO FIND THE MAN HE ACCUSED OF HAVING CHEATED HIM. THAT MAN, KNOWING HE WAS CAUGHT DEAD TO RIGHTS AND WITH PRISON STARING HIM IN THE FACE, TOOK THE ONLY WAY OUT. HE KILLED WYNANT. NOW, MR. JORGENSON-- YES? YOU'RE NOT EATING. DON'T YOU CARE FOR OYSTERS? I WAS LISTENING TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. GOOD. THIS MURDERER IS VERY CLEVER. HE STUDIED THIS WHOLE THING OUT VERY CAREFULLY. YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT, WOULDN'T YOU, GILBERT? YES. NO! HE PLANNED THE WHOLE THING BEAUTIFULLY. AFTER HE KILLED WYNANT, HE WIRED MacCAULAY USING WYNANT'S NAME AND TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE SHOP. WHICH I DID. NATURALLY. THEN HE DESTROYED ALL OF WYNANT'S CLOTHES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS WATCH CHAIN. HE FIGURED THAT SOMEDAY THAT MIGHT COME IN HANDY. THEN HE TOOK WYNANT'S BODY AND BURIED IT WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CLOTHES-- A FAT MAN'S CLOTHES TO THROW US OFF THE TRACK. HE PUT IN A BELT BUCKLE WITH AN "R" ON IT, HOPING WE WOULD THINK IT WAS ROSEBREEN-- AN OLD ENEMY OF WYNANT'S WHO DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO. OH, MORELLI, WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING YOUR KNIFE SOME OTHER WAY? YOU'RE WORRYING GILBERT. IF THAT KNIFE'S MISSING, I'LL LOOK FOR IT IN YOUR BACK. AFTER OUR HERO HAD KILLED WYNANT, HE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA. HE REALIZED HE AND JULIA COULD STILL COLLECT MONEY. WYNANT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF TOWN. NO ONE KNEW WHERE. OUR HERO WROTE LETTERS TO MacCAULAY, SIGNING WYNANT'S NAME, SO MacCAULAY WOULD CONTINUE TO SEND MONEY TO JULIA. HE EVEN TELEPHONED MacCAULAY. THAT FIRST DAY YOU CAME TO SEE ME, HE TELEPHONED HE WAS IN TOWN. HE CALLED WHILE I WAS OUT. WASN'T HE SLICK ABOUT THAT? THAT SAME AFTERNOON, JULIA TELEPHONED HIM. SHE SAID THAT YOU WERE COMING, MIMI. I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT MR. WYNANT. EXACTLY. WELL, OUR HERO GOT TERRIFIED. HE WAS AFRAID THAT JULIA WOULD BREAK DOWN AND TELL YOU HE HAD MURDERED WYNANT. SO HE WENT TO JULIA, AND HE KILLED HER. HE LEFT WYNANT'S WATCH CHAIN IN HER HAND. Is this true? I don't know. Why are you saying it? It's the only way it makes sense. I hope you're well. HIS PLAN WAS WORKING BEAUTIFULLY. EVERYBODY BELIEVED THAT WYNANT WAS IN TOWN AND THAT HE HAD DONE IT. THERE WAS JUST ONE HITCH-- A BIRD NAMED NUNHEIM... YOUR FRIEND. NUNHEIM HAD GONE TO CALL ON HER. HE HEARD THE SHOTS. HE SAW THE MURDERER LEAVE. HE KNEW WHO DID IT. IF HE KNEW, HE DIDN'T TELL ME! YOU CAN'T DRAG ME INTO THIS! OUR HERO HAD PAID NUNHEIM ONCE TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. WHEN NUNHEIM THREATENED HIM AGAIN, HE BUMPED HIM OFF. OH, HE WAS VERY CLEVER. EVERYBODY, EVEN OUR ASTUTE FRIEND GUILD, THOUGHT WYNANT WAS ALIVE AND WAS THE MURDERER. YOU CAN SKIP THAT. BUT OUR HERO HAD JUST ONE WEAK LINK IN HIS CHAIN. THE TELEGRAMS AND PHONE CALLS WERE ALL VERY WELL, BUT NO ONE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN WYNANT, SO OUR HERO PICKED ON POOR MIMI TO STRENGTHEN HIS CASE. MIMI IS THE ONLY ONE AT THIS TABLE WHO CAN TELL US WHO THE REAL MURDERER IS. MIMI, WHO TOLD YOU TO SAY YOU SAW WYNANT? NOBODY TOLD ME. I DID SEE HIM. LET MY MOTHER ALONE! WHAT WERE YOU PAID? IT'S TRUE. I DID SEE HIM. HE ISN'T DEAD! YOU'RE LYING. YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY. YOU WERE GETTING A GOOD PRICE FOR SAYING YOU SAW WYNANT. YOU FIGURED YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING IF HE'S DEAD. I'M NOT STAYING HERE TO BE INSULTED! MacCAULAY, YOU DREW UP WYNANT'S WILL. WASN'T MIMI CUT OFF IF SHE REMARRIED? I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ANSWER THAT. TANNER, ISN'T THAT TRUE? YES. THAT SHOULDN'T KEEP YOU FROM TELLING THE TRUTH, MIMI. MRS. JORGENSON, WERE YOU EVER DIVORCED FROM CHRIS? NO. YOU SEE, MIMI, UNDER THE LAW, YOU'VE NEVER REMARRIED. YOU'RE STILL ONE OF THE HEIRS. ARE YOU HOLDING OUT FOR A FEW DOLLARS WHEN YOU CAN GET THE WHOLE ESTATE? REMEMBER THE OTHER TWO MIXED IN WITH HIM--JULIA AND NUNHEIM. WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT TALK, HE BUMPED THEM OFF. HE WON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES ON YOU. DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? YOU DIRTY LITTLE-- WELL, THERE'S YOUR MURDERER-- MacCAULAY. MacCAULAY? SURE. WANT ME TO WRAP HIM IN CELLOPHANE? COME ON. GET IN THERE! MacCAULAY! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WELL, I'LL BE A MONKEY'S UNCLE! NICKY, HE MIGHT HAVE KILLED YOU! YOU SORRY HE DIDN'T? I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT A DETECTIVE. NOT A HIP IN A CARLOAD. WELL, HERE'S TO YOU TWO! AND TO YOU TWO, TOO! WHY, THE RAT! HE CAN'T TOP US. NO. TOOT, TOOT! SHALL I KEEP THESE FRESH FOR YOU? YES, THANK YOU. HA HA HA! MY GRACIOUS! IT'S 1:00. IT'S WHAT? IT'S 1:00. NO, BABY, IT'S 11:00. IT'S 1:00. I SET MY WATCH AHEAD. YOU SET YOUR WATCH TO 12:00, DIDN'T YOU? YOU'RE IN NEW YORK, FOR INSTANCE-- NICK. SAN FRANCISCO IS 3,000 MILES WEST OF NEW YORK. THE SUN DOES NOT GET TO SAN FRANCISCO-- NICK. NICK! YES, BABY. DOES THAT MEAN IT'S BEDTIME? HA HA! WELL, THAT'S A THOUGHT. OH, WELL. COME ON, SUGAR. LEAVE US DO IT. ASTA. WELL, GOOD NIGHT, CHILDREN. GOOD NIGHT. AND FLIGHTS OF ANGELS SING THEE TO THY REST. SAME TO YOU, NICK. GOOD NIGHT. NORA, I CAN NEVER THANK YOU ENOUGH. OH, DON'T BE SILLY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GOSH, DARLING, I THOUGHT THEY'D NEVER LEAVE. OH, I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER LEAVE. BABY, THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST. IT SETS IN THE WEST. IF IT'S 12:00 IN NEW YORK, AUTOMATICALLY IT'S-- NICKY, PUT ASTA IN HERE WITH ME TONIGHT. HA HA HA! OH, YEAH? CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
