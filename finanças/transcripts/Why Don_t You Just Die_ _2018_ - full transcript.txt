WHITE MIRROR FILM COMPANY PARADISE PRODUCTION CENTER SUPPORTED BY RUSSIAN FEDERATION Ministry of Culture PRESENTS "He did not survive to know who the winner was." - Flann O'Brien One, two, three, evil can not touch me! What do you want? -What is it? -I is Matvey, Olya's boyfriend. -What then? -I'm Olya's boyfriend! And? She wanted to be seen. She probably forgot to tell you that. Quiet now! She's not home. Maybe she's late? Hi. -Matvey, Olya's boyfriend. -Nice to meet you. I am Natasha, Olya's mother. - Is Olya somewhere here? - She is late. She should have said something. I told you I was going to the country. Thoughtless girl. Luckily I not gone yet. Do not stand there. Come in. Tea or coffee? C-coffee. You should have chosen tea. Coffee takes forever. And sit down now. Do you always carry that with you? A friend asked me for it. How long have you known Olya Matvey? Has she said that I work in the police? I am a detective. It's probably because of my profession, but I am very aware of my daughter's friends. Men... I guess that all fathers are. Tell me about your friend. Are you the same age? 25, I guess? He is 25 and still has no hammer of his own. Well, he's ... He's a data guy. Data Guy? Matvey, you have to keep up. Look around. All data is guys now. In one way or another. So what do you do? Judging by your hands and the hammer, you are not a data guy. No matter what you do, it is important that you take it seriously. Do you like her a lot? I do. Do  you like to fuck her? Excuse me? I asked you if you like to fuck my daughter. What's happening here? Calm it, Matvey. I'm just kidding. And whose is the hammer? A friend's. Natasha, go to the bathroom. - I should probably go. - Sit. Sit, I said! -Andrei, what's happening? -Go to the bathroom and stay there. Sugar... You need sugar for the coffee. Sit down and I'll get it. Stop! Turn around! Who are you? Why are you here? Why are you here, I said! -Andrei? -Get out! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE! MATVEY What are you doing? Stop now. I want you to kill a man for me. Can you do that? Stop messing around. I want you to kill my father. Why? He raped me. Your father? If you can believe it. Some like to fuck their own daughters. When did it happen? I was twelve. Does it matter when it was? Every day... for fifteen years... while he lived his life... and ate, slept, and fucked my mum, or someone else... ... I have not stopped thinking about it. Knowing him... in every touch and gaze. He continues to grow in me... like a cancerous tumor that poisons everything. I can't go on like this. He must be removed. You will help me? Natasha, how stupid are you? Burn everything. Ah, bollocks! It's basically pretty simple. This little fucking thing, this hook... Bastard If you try to open it, it's cunting impossible. Just take it easy, and use a fork, even if it's shit because it's impossible to bend. Therefore, we adopt a much more common method: An ordinary hairpin. Bend it and insert it and try and get up bastard. Just so...  there! We achieved the goal and got our long awaited freedom. But it is not so simple. The problem is the new stuff from across the Atlantic. This is imported. The bastards invented something called "double lock". There are more than one hole here. See what's happening now. It blocks the hook. So there! Now it's completely stuck. With that stuff, you can't get the bastard up. So with these handcuffs made in Satan's shit construction... it's over. Our dream of freedom is gone. IMPORTED -Dumbskull. -You are. Matvey... Is that your real name? Who are you and why are you here? How do you know I have a daughter? Has someone sent you? Well? Tell me who sent you! Talk! Talk, I said! Listen up... You give me no choice. Come closer... ah'll tell thee. Matvey, let's try again. Think this through. You have the chance to finish this, here and now. I promise to take off the handcuffs and let you go unharmed. I don't know you, have never seen you before... and will never see you again, but... you must tell me everything, okay? So why did you break into my apartment? Never put your hands on a child. What? Never put your hands on a child. What about a child? What the fuck is this!? What the hell...? Are you playing with me now? Okay, then we'll play. Get away from here, damn it! -Have you thought about it? -Forget it. Wait a minute. Wait, wait... Okay. Are you going to tell me why you came here? So... you killed him? Thankfully. He said I touched Olya when she was little. He came here to avenge her. But you... ... didn't. Or did you do it? No, hell no! Are you crazy? I don't understand. I thought... I thought it was about the job, that we were too tough on someone. Many of them would give again if they could. This is just stupid. Have you... talked to Olya? What should I tell her? Let him go. Do not soil your hands before it is too late. Why would I let him go? The guy is a crook! Call your men. Get them to put him in jail. His leg looks like a sieve. How do I explain it? And the money then... Damn it! Okay then, I'll call Evgeniti. He will help me. Do not do anything stupid. Get that gun away. I never touched her. I never touched my daughter. I was just going to drop you. Natasha can attest to that. We should meet Olya, talk and sort out this misunderstanding. I apologize. I'm terribly sorry for the leg. I was nervous, my job means I have many enemies. You refused to talk. I can pay for any treatment. You have seen that I have the money. Money... I can give you a little extra for the trouble, so to speak. You are... apparently we are family. And justice, then? I also want justice. It never happened, believe me! Call her. Natasha, get the phone. Get it, I said! Turn on the speaker. -Hello? -Listen to me, Olya? -Dad? Hey, Olya. Listen, your friend is here... It's not a pleasant situation currently. Can you clarify something for us? -Which friend? -Matvey. I do not know anyone by that name. What do you mean? A tall guy with a crew cut. I don't know anyone like that. Is everything all right in there? I'll call back. So much for justice. -Do not do it! -Away with you. -Please, don't do it! -Away, I said! Shut up now! Evgeniti. EVGENITI Honey, I... I can't speak right now. It's a bit inconvenient. Can I call you back? What is it now? Of course I love you. I love you very much. You make my life worth living. Without you I am nothing. Don't even say that. Don't do it. We'll get the money. I'll arrange it. Sorry darling. I can't talk anymore. Okay bye. I love you so much. Kiss. Can't you hold it in? She is beautiful. Not my type. She is a bit like my Olya. Are there more lamps? I get headaches. I-I could not find any. You are hell of a cop. Anyway... We have a box knife, probably used to cut her. Is it true? A bag of white powder similar to cocaine. And some pills. All that is needed for a party. The rope and gag is blood soaked. A pile of hundreds... There's 90 000, by the way. And the keys to an Infiniti. Cursed upper class youth. Take him away now. We are waiting for the forensics. Give me the camera. I want to take more pictures. I have already p-photographed everything. Give it to me, I said. You'll get it back, fuck sake! This is my chance. What do you mean? I need money. It's an emergency. As you know, the surgery costs a fortune. What do you mean? He's a rich guy. We'll talk with his parents and let him go for a fee. -How will that happen -I don't know. I'll figure out something. He cut up a girl with a box knife. There's nothing to think about. He was set up. There was a third person who spiked his wine. And when those two passed out, he cut up the girl. - It just sounds stupid. - Come on! It's going to work. We can distribute the cash and bribe the right people. It's not the first time. But it was easy compared to this carnage. I'm not doing it for my sake. It's for Klava. We saw immediately that he was a good guy. He had just gone astray. So we want to help. As you know, it's a tricky case, so we can not give any guarantees. You leave the money in a locker at the station. If everything goes well and he is released, we'll collect. But remember, if the cabinet is empty when he is released... you and your son will have serious problems. Let's go. I just wanted to thank you. For what? For you to do this and help me. These... This money is... our last... our last hope. Her health has become much worse. That's enough. Pull yourself together. You would do the same for me. Last night... she didn't even recognize me. She had no idea, you know? I stood in front of her like this, and she just... she just... Sit here and pull yourself together. I'll get the money. And where is... The cabinet was empty. What? The cabinet was empty. Those useless rats! The pigs! Swine! Riff raff! Swine! Stop crying! It's already bad as it is. Andrei... That thing you do with your leg... makes you seem insane. Natasha, you can boil some tea for us? Tea? But without sugar. Okay, no sugar. So, who is he? Did you know? I don't know what's worse. If she really didn't know who he is... or... So if he is not her friend, who is he then? So you... never touched her then? Are you crazy? She's my daughter! I never touched her! -Have you all gone mad here? - Okay, slow down now. I'm just trying to understand. If everything he says is true, and he really feels Olya... Look at his legs. I do not think he's lying. In such cases... Why would she say to him ... ... you know, that, if it never happened? But I have not done it! I believe you, but think for a bit. -What's this about, then? -No clue. Maybe she knew he is the kind of villain who would agree to kill you. Why would she want that? You tell me. She's your daughter. Thanks. Thanks so much. Andrei, we carried him to the bathroom. Natasha, go to bed and get some rest. The two of us will resolve this, okay? Go now. Help. We ask her to come here. What then? We ask Olya to come and see him. Then we see how she reacts. So you want to show your daughter the body that you have mutilated, which probably belongs to her boyfriend? I need to know. Because if she's behind this... -She's almost here. -Then take him out of here. 2000s He came round. -All good? -Yes. How many fingers? Your turn. -You do not dare. -That we all see. Look, he laughs! Hit with fists! CARDIAC ARREST IN 12 MINUTES CARDIAC ARREST IN 17 MINUTES Quiet! He breathes. THE WORLD'S BEST FATHER Did you see anything? Is there something after death? Yes, there is something. -So there's something? -I just don't remember what. Andrei, there is something! So fucking what! Don't listen to him. He's sick in the head! Why give him water? He's finished! Andrei, we should wait for Olya, so it's okay. You wouldn't say that if he swung the hammer at you. Okay, now drink. What the hell is this? Stop it! I asked you to help me, not him! I try to help everyone! Get it together! Had you called the police instead of playing Gestapo here, we would not have problems. -He couldn't call the police. -What? What the fuck is this bullshit? Quiet now. What do you mean? -I saw the money. -Shut it, or I'll bury thee! Andrei! -Why do you believe that shit? -Quiet now, Andrei! Silence. What money? In the showcase. Where's the money from? Where is the money from? You know very well. You know very well where it came from. Andrei, how could you? We could... have done it together. My wife Klava could have been alive. She would have died even if you had paid ten times as much. Andrei, do not say so. She gave up a long time ago, and you know it. She just sucked the life out of others. Just look at yourself. God knows what had become of you because of her. I myself was ready to strangle her... just to stop you whinging. I freed you. Look there... look at the money there. Half of it is yours. Yours alone. No more drops, pills and surgeries. No more whining and misery. Only the finest food and fancy whores. It's for you only, Evgeniti. You would not have done it. Come on, wake up now! One day you'll thank me. My wife died because of you. No, she died of cancer. Lower the gun motherfucker. Now. Beloved Olya! Forgive me. Mother... So, I have lived to witness my death. I saw my wife in a dream last night. The first time since the funeral. Evgeniti! Beautiful Klava ... How beautiful she was in her white dress, just like on our wedding day. Do you remember? I started to cry... and Klava just held me. Tightly against her chest. And I felt completely calm. Be quiet. You should not talk right now. OLYA Bareheaded, he was carried on a stretcher Bing, bang, bing, bang And in his grave fell many tears Farewell, my dove! No, no, he has seen his last, go lay in the black coffin He will no more come again I die! Oleg asked after you. -Don't even try to explain. -But I'm ready. You're an hour late. I was delayed. I'll come in earlier in the morning. You do not work here anymore. Why not? Because you're fired. Take it off and go. Because I was late once? First,  this is not 'once' and you know it. And second: you can not work with the team. Oleg, please. I can not afford to lose this job now. With my job at the theater,I can't find anything else. The salary is crumbs. I can not live on it. I sleep only four hours a day. But you're one of the team ... ... and we have never had any problems. Right? I promise to do better. I can work in some hours. Please, Oleg, help me. Please... Can you whack it for me? Jack me off. You know. No, I mean... Oksana used to do it, but then she started dating the bartender then I felt I couldn't  ask her anymore. You need my help after all. Think of it as an exchange of services. I might even... give you a bonus. At the next payment. What is it? What is it mother? I do not know. She is mostly in the country house. Are you listening? What do you want me to do? Help me. Why would I do that? Because you're my father. You are almost thirty. I do not need much. Just to get by. Get yourself a good job. I already have a good job. Yes, except that it is poorly paid. I'm of ferra shower. Lock up after you. -Do you know him? -Let her go, I beg you! For the last time: do you know him? -She's your daughter! -Shut up! Other wise I'll shoot the skull out of her. Yes, I know him. I do! Is it the money? Did you see the money and send him here? Is is the money ?! Yeah. She would kill her own father for a big piece of paper... You see, Mummy? What a nice daughter, we have raised! How can you live with yourself? What are you looking at? Yes, I needed the money. No, he never raped me. It changes nothing. He still destroyed my life! Bullshit, you little brat! I've hardly seen you sober. You beat us. I've dreamed about killing you since I was five! Together at last, like a family. My dear darlings ... Beloved Andrei, offer our guests some tea... while I go change. I'm a little... I just... I think we have cookies somewhere. Do you know where they are? Mama... because of you... I killed my friend. My only friend. We've been friends since we were little. You're still my daughter. With him, we... well, you know. Yes of course. Go and keep your mum company. I have to clean up here. Olya... If you try again, or if somebody else finds out about the money, I forget that I have a daughter. Sure, dad. Mum, no! Mama! Fuck! -Don't move out of the stain! -Dad, where are you going? Dad! Hurry! Mama... Mama. Mama. She's not breathing. She's not breathing. She left a letter. Oh no... It was just a piece of paper. Help...! Olya, see who it is. Olya! Oil, what the hell! Olya... Not a peep. Calm... calm... It's almost over. Hello. Hey, it took a while before you opened. So? I didn't hear you. No wonder. The neighbors have complained about the noise here. Well... I am terribly sorry. I probably had the television on too loud. Is everything okay? -Miss? -Yes. Are you home alone? Yeah. Only the windows are open. Therefore it pulls. Is this your apartment? No. It's my parents'. They are in the country. May we see your ID? -What's that? -Wait. I thought you looked familiar. Olya Lisovskaja Andrejevna? You will not be Andrei's daughter? That's me. Why didn't you say?! He's a legend around the station. Well I was a bit shy. I just got my period. So it's a bit inconvenient. - Excuse our disturbance. - No, it is I who should apologize. The call came from apartment eight. Ah? Those idiots. Make sure to say 'whut whut' to yo daddy from us. I will. Bye. Where does he get the strength from? What are you gonna do? This is what I think: Natasha met Evgeniti behind my back. I was in the house in the country, so she invited him here. He was not alone, he came with this guy. They got drunk and started to discuss, then a fight broke out. Evgeniti stabbed him with the knife and fucked his legs. And that bastard shot him with a rifle. Then he crawled up on the sofa and died. And mama? A misguided hit during the fight. We put her here, like she hit her head. Not very credible, especially when the police saw me. It's a formality. There will not be anyone investigating. Why not? I haven't worked all my life for the police in vain. Now it's definitely time to die. Do you have cigarettes? Now we go. Don't you care that mama died? I haven't realized it yet. But you realized immediately that your friend was dead. Shit-heel. What should I do then? It was you who started this. Because you're so damn greedy. No matter how much you tried to destroy my childhood... at least I could distinguish... between black and white. I was able to distinguish right from wrong. When I did something bad... I knew it at once. And I was ashamed. But then... time passes. You make one compromise after another. Then suddenly it's not so bad to do bad things. It's just a way of life. And it is surprising ... how all evil can be justified. Then normalized. People adapt. But you were way ahead of them. As a child, you were... pretty stupid. I'm surprised that you did not become smarter with age. Are you still alive? I did not think it would be like this. I die. And. I'm sorry. It is okay. Evil can not touch me.
