Jocelyne! Seen this? Sorry... 18 million near here! 18 million. Just think! The winner hasn't come forward. In 4 days, it's put back in play. He must be dumb! Or she... It could've been us. Honestly... I knew right away it was me. Without checking. I don't believe it... A two-euro ticket bought in Arras on the square. 18,547,301 euros. 6, 7, 24, 30 and 32. One chance in 76 million and it had to be me. I wish it had never happened. A few weeks earlier... Arras. Population: 42,000. Its belfry... A plaque on Rue du Miroir de Venise to mark the birth of Eugène François Vidocq on July 24, 1775. A few steps away... my haberdashery. For Christmas, cloths and napkins to embroider. For Mardi Gras, fancy dress patterns. After that, it's quiet until spring. That's no good... Try to sell yourself, Mum. It's for the Net, not a church sale. Let's start again... Go that way. How do you see this blog? This blog is... This blog is for women who prefer homemade to shop-bought. Here, we can exchange tips and ideas or even recipes. In short, a place to meet. It's better if you come to the shop but it's not obligatory. See you soon. - Was that good? - Excellent. I'll edit it for your home page. Great! Is it that late? Damn! Dad's really handsome in a suit! Do I look ok? Great. Go on. He hates to wait. I'll lock up. I like you like this. THE LIST OF MY DESIRES You're here today with colleagues, family and friends who wished to honour you. This service award symbolizes your contribution to our nation's wealth, to its development but also to its humanity. For, let us remember, "Work's true reward "lies not in what it allows you to earn, "but in what it allows you to become." And now the buffet is open! Not too bored? I'm happy to be with you and see your colleagues. Jo! Meet Nathalie, my wife... How do you do, Nathalie? Delighted. Congratulations, Alain. It wasn't too tough. 30 years married, 30 years in the firm. These days I'm a dying breed. But Jo's on the right track. He'll be next. - Really? - You bet! The course is going well? Better than well. He's a real leader of men. I keep telling him that. Here. Thanks. May I borrow him? Not many men know how to dance now. I hope you're not jealous, Jocelyne? Let them dream. On that level, Jo deserves an award. They're crazy about him. Personally, in his shoes... Enough, Alain. What award was it? - The 30-year one. - Not bad. I'm up to 26. A medal for 30 years with a firm. It's like war. Odd way of viewing it. But it's true. I hate you being so negative. It's a good job. You'll get promoted. We're doing well, right? - Here! - Thanks. Got the spring shirt out, Ludo? I do what I can to get noticed by you ladies. Girls. Only Jocelyne is hitched. Thanks. What's that? An awesome site. Every draw since 2008. For instance, 25 has come up 27 times. - Not bad. - No, it sucks. Like 34. Another bad one. But 5 has come up... 32 times. But 23 takes the biscuit: 49 times. So I'm playing... 23. Definitely not. Everyone will. If it comes up, you'll win peanuts. No, I'm playing 49. As in "49 times". 49! Listen to numbers. It's scientific. Listen to them. - Ludo! - Yes. Here you go! Aim for the jackpot. - And you? - Me? It's 18 million. A villa on the Riviera, a world tour, a diamond... Loads of Louboutins! No way, I'm never lucky. Lucky... What do you mean? It's not luck. This time next year, I'll be rich in the sun. - With new boobs. - Me too. They look fine. Looks can be deceiving. If we lived in outer space, weightlessness would keep our tits up. Exactly. I'm fine. Jo loves me as I am. Sure, men are all the same. A year from now, if we win, I'll install weightlessness at home. I'm not plucking pubes all my life. I'm aiming higher. Armpits? Stupid! Come on... Think of your kids. What'll you leave them? A stock of zippers? Come on, get to work. All right. Don't look at what I'm playing. I know you. - These two? - Yes. Like this. - Is it pretty? - Very. Two metres of each. For a house jacket. Do you want me to add a strip of ribbon? Yes, good idea. That'll be nice. - I'll order it, Mrs Viguier! - No, "Lucette62". That's my login on your blog! You posted the olive cake recipe! A customer said it was delicious. Pleased to hear it. Do you need a deposit? No, I know you. By Tuesday. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye, Mrs Viguier! Hello. Are you Jocelyne Guerbette? Juliette Merval, from the local paper. - I'd like to interview you. - Me? About your blog. 2,000 subscribers in less than 2 months, 1,200 connections a day and rising... How do you explain it? I can't explain it. I... I'm a bit out of my depth but it's nice. But could it be a matter of touch? Perhaps? Do you think people suffer in... Do you think people suffer in modern society from the lack of contact? Has the virtual killed the tactile? The erotic even? People used to keep diaries. Now they write blogs. - You kept a diary? - Like everyone. I have no answers to your questions. I'm sorry. Well, I... I have to tell you... My mum's been alone 10 years. She gets up at 6, makes coffee, waters her plants, drinks her coffee, washes and, by 7 o'clock, her day is over. A month ago, she heard about your blog. Now, thanks to your trimmings and your pompoms, she chats on your blog, she asks neighbours round. So don't say you have no answers. You do people good. You realize that, don't you? I've caught you unprepared. It's not that. I've never thought about it. Know what? Think it over and I'll come back for your answers. Ok? Can I count on you? A lot of people do. See you soon, Jocelyne. Goodbye. Of course I kept a diary with tiny hearts as dots over the "i"s... The photos of a boy I had a crush on, Philippe, whom I never dared to speak to... Song lyrics, all my illusions... Dad, on the day of my communion. He can't remember now. He can't remember a thing. Since his stroke, no past, no future. Just a 6-minute present. And every 6 minutes, his memory reboots. Every 6 minutes, he asks who I am and how Mum is. Where is she? She's gone shopping. She'll call in later. She mustn't forget to bring me my newspaper. And some shaving foam. I've nearly run out. That's one memory I felt I had to spare him... Mum falling, just like that one day leaving me and Dad alone with no one to say sweet things to us, things to make us dream, things we need to do... Just life and do what you can to be happy. Apple tart. Cool. - I'm quitting college. - Not again! To do what? To make pancakes in Grenoble with my girl. Your girl? Do we know her? I'm leaving tomorrow. Could you do my ironing? Good luck. With the pancakes. Are you staying? Back to London on Tuesday. I have exams. Coming? Neat! It's my graduation film. I hope you like it. - Turn it up, Nadine. - It's silent. I've filmed Ravel's Boléro for the deaf. I know what she meant. It's a film for others, not herself. That's rare. You bet! I love your daughter. Romain's a boy, he's 20 and dumb. That's normal. He'll do well. He's as hot as his dad. Look at ours. He was no rocket scientist but he still became... our father. What were we saying? Your mum's great. Were your names her idea? No, Dad's. He was happy with twins but sad we weren't identical, so gave us one name. That's cute. No, it's dumb. What'll we be like with kids? If we have any. You're lucky, you have two. Three. Forgive me, I forgot. I'm sorry. No, it's ok. It's ok. It's good to talk about it. I usually never can. - Not even with Jo? - It drives him mad. It hurts to say this but... we didn't have that angel for the right reasons. A mistake? Jo didn't want me anymore. After Nadine was born, I put on weight, I was tired... He stopped touching me. Men, honestly... Except when he drank... I never saw her eyes but I know she was pretty. Think about her a lot? When she left my womb, she was blue. Her heart had stopped. Jo yelled, drank, then said life was sick. You think it's my fault, huh? Because I'd drunk? I never said that. Stop it. That's what you think! Right? Look at me when I speak! Look at me! My baby died because of you! You let yourself go! That's why! Your belly's a trashcan, you poor cow! You're a sow! A fucking fat sow! There! What are you doing? Pack your bags, Mum, and tell Romain to do the same. I did as Nadine told me and we went far away. Are you ok, Mum? He must be worrying where we are. That'll teach him. Maybe... I don't want to hurt him. This does you good. That's what matters. Look around, it's so cool here. The first time I saw the sea was with him. On our honeymoon. You came to Nice? You're so lucky. No, Etretat. We were broke. We go back every year on our anniversary. Stop hurting yourself. Put some sunscreen on. It's hot. You're talking rubbish. Romain? Let's go to the club. Let me help you. It's not done but thanks anyway. I was just leaving anyway. So was I. Orange Pekoe. It's a light tea, originally from Ceylon. Very pleasant in the afternoon. - Have you been to Ceylon? - Why are you doing this? I saw you from behind earlier on the beach. Your lonely air overwhelmed me. Don't say things like that. No... I'm married. Are you happy? I don't think so. Not right now maybe but... that's no reason. You want to control things. Let yourself go for once... I told you... I have a husband, and children. My children... My children! Wait... You never know. His voice, his gentleness... Nadine! Romain! Jo's meanness, my sorrow... Nothing was a sufficient reason. That year, I nearly had a lover. Nearly. It was wiser to return home. No more drink. We need fights now and then but no more meanness. - Let's forget it. - No. I don't want to forget. The baby existed, if only for 2 minutes. But it wasn't my fault, Jo. And yours neither. Come on. And life resumed almost like before. Hi, girls. - Lunch? - Sure! But Jo turned to alcohol-free beer. He started to dream of things to ease the pain. His kind of things: a flat screen, a Porsche Cayenne. Maybe a younger and prettier wife but... he doesn't say that. The kids grew and I kept hoping Dad would get better. You should come more often. I come every day, Dad. Yes, I know but... How's work? The shop? Yes, the shop. Is your boss still such a drag? I don't have a boss. I took over the lease. Really? I didn't know that. Well done. You never told me. It's true... I'm really happy for you. Well done. What have you called it? "Ten Golden Fingers". "Ten Golden Fingers". Not bad... Sounds pretty classy. What is it you sell? Haberdashery. Haberdashery, of course! Sometimes I wonder what my mind's up to. I get the impression... - What? - Nothing, it's absurd... Don't make fun of me but... I think I know you from somewhere. There, the 6 minutes are up. It's sad but, shit, sometimes, to make it easier, I decide it's funny and I invent a new life for him. You must remember, you and Mum always talked about it. That close to a Nobel Prize! Yes, it was infuriating. You'd learnt your speech in Swedish and rehearsed it every night in my room. What were those damn Americans called? Hold on... Sharp and Roberts! That's right! Sharp and Roberts. The swines. Is it all in there? Can I borrow it? - Here. - Thanks. Jo? Jo, it's me! I've got your medicine. Take it, ok. What's that? A book on La Scala for Dad. I thought he'd like to be a conductor next time. Your magazine... I'm cold... I'll turn the heating up. Want something to eat? Not hungry. Morning and evening. And take this now. Danièle... I'll stay at home today and tomorrow... - He's no better? - A bit but it's moved down to his chest. You know men... Would you mind... Thanks, you're an angel. It's closed, ladies. What's wrong? Jocelyne's husband is sick. She won't be in. "I could run the shop until Jo gets better. "We'll knit him a sweater. What size is he? Or a scarf... "What colour?" What colour? I don't know... Red. Red. That's kind but there's no need. "He needs rest and good food. Carbs and iron for strength. "Pasta with spinach." "My recipe: in a pot, "add cumin, garlic, salt and pepper, "season with nutmeg." Nutmeg... Nutmeg! Come and eat! Have a good day. Jo is better. He went to work today. The shop will re-open this morning. Thanks, all of you. This is hessian. It's strong. It's beautiful. Excuse me. For a baby... Alpaca is much softer. Take a look at the colours. - Excuse me... - Just a second. - Mrs Viguier! - Here... Bamboo, good choice. It's handy. It never catches when you knit. Exactly. 17 euros exactly! - Excuse me... - Yes, just a minute. And my order? Yes, I'll see to it. - Let me know. - Goodbye, Mrs Viguier! Feeling better, Mrs Dubreuil? Seeking part-time sales assistant We were bakers but the inspectors shut us down. The bastards! What are a few roaches? They don't bother anyone. I guess. Thank you. Sorry, it's not worth waiting. Let's go. Go ahead. Well, hello. My name's Madeleine but I prefer Mado. I'm 30. I've been divorced since June 22, 2006. But I'm over it now. I'm motivated by manual work. What else... Yes, no children. Hobbies: horses, riding, movies with Kevin Costner... before the hair transplant. Scrapbooking... But you don't do articles on scrapbooking. No. Right... But it's a good idea. Could you handle it? Me? - I'm going to cry. - Don't. It does me good. Jocelyne! Seen this? Sorry. 18 million near here! 18 million. Just think! The winner hasn't come forward. In 4 days, it's put back in play. He must be dumb! Or she. It could've been us. Honestly, people like that get on my tits! We've had it. Luck never strikes twice. But the lottery isn't luck, it's probability so it can. Well, probably. Jocelyne? Jocelyne... Answer me! Jocelyne... Answer me! Are you ok? You scared me. What's wrong? Nothing. I'll call the doctor. Don't bother. It's nothing. I skipped lunch. Help me up. I'll sit for a minute. I had a weird dream. What about? You'll only laugh if I tell you. You should eat something. - I'm ok. - Let your man handle it. You're my man and I can't tell you what's happening. That smells good. We need to talk. Feeling better? What do you think? - I have to tell you... - It's not serious? If anything happened to you... I'd die without you, you know. After the thread company, I'm meeting the wool people. They're crazy about the blog. Make the most of it, do a little shopping. Hello, I'm Jocelyne Guerbette. I'm here to see... The Arras winner. Bravo, it was about time! Mr Meunier? Yes, she's here. You said it! Very good, Mr Meunier. Mr Meunier will see you. Your ID. Coffee? - No thanks. - Decaf? Tea then? Thanks but no. You like nothing... Mrs Guerbette! You gave us quite a fright. I'm sorry. 18 million just lying around. I pointed that out to her. It's not your money... Quite right. What a personality! Now you have your badge, let's go. Follow me. Just look at her... Yes, José... Fine. Thanks, José. The cheque will be ready in 2 minutes. Have a seat, Mrs Guerbette. Make yourself at home. Can I get you a coffee? Ok... I'd like you to meet a colleague. In fact, you have to meet her. This way, please. Here we are. There's a medical? What a personality! Come in, please. I'll leave you to it. You need to understand that what is happening to you is both a great opportunity and a great misfortune. You're rich. You can buy anything. Give gifts. But be careful. Why? You must be wary. When you have money, people love you. People already do. But suddenly strangers love you too. They'll write you poems, love letters... They'll propose to you. Ask for money for little Jocelyne who has leukaemia. A spastic's mother will send a video of her kid falling down the stairs and ask for money to put in a stair lift. Another will send photos of her mother drooling and soiling herself. Not to mention your... cousin in Guadeloupe. My cousin? Yes! Victoire Guerbete. With one T. But what's one letter compared to blood ties? She'll want money for a flight to come and visit at long last and to rent a small apartment as that's handier than a hotel room. She'll introduce you to her faith-healer friend who'll make you lose those extra pounds. I'm already dieting. And the bankers! What about the bankers? So sweet all of a sudden. "I have tax-free investments. "Invest in property, this loan or that... "Fortune tax? Audits? Don't worry. "There's time." Right, Mrs Guerbette? Coffee? You're trying to scare me away? On the contrary. I'm here to reassure you. Some manage to survive. People who've won 100 million. Precisely! So many depressions, divorces, family feuds and destroyed families! Fingers severed for a PIN. Forgeries and suicide. Money drives people mad, Mrs Guerbette! It's the cause of 80 % of crimes! 50 % of breakdowns. Does your family know? - No. - Perfect. That's perfect. We can help you to find the words, the way and the time to lessen the shock. Any children? You'll no longer be their mother but their wealthy mother. They'll want a share. They'll talk about bequests, ways to avoid death duties... A husband? Yes. With a lowly job... Why do you say that? He'll stop work to handle your fortune. The fortune you share. It'll be his as much as yours since he loves you. He loves you? He'll say that a lot. He'll buy you flowers. I'm allergic. Chocolates... I'm dieting. Jewels! Whatever! He'll spoil you anyhow. He'll slowly poison you. It's obvious. Greed destroys everything in its path. The Borgias, the Agnellis... The Madoffs! I don't have an answer but if I were you... What's this? Our counselling service. Is everything clear? Still no coffee? Yes. No. I think I can manage. Yes... They all say that. Your cheque... In your name. Come on, don't be scared. Let's check it: 18,547,301 euros and 28 cents! Is that right? Is this your new life? You don't want a draft? I'm sure. Not about a lot, but this at least. A bit of paper worth 18 million. I prefer paper. The common sense of country folk... Are you ok? You're pale. Have a coffee. I don't want coffee! I hate coffee. I never drink it! Thanks for coming. I'm so happy to be back. - You must be beat. - I'm ok. How did your day go? Fine. Shall we go? What's up? You've 10 minutes to pack. You remembered. Go! Butter and sugar. It's hot! 5 euros. - You'll never eat it all. - I won't? Look, my shawl! The angora model I put on my site. - You're proud, huh? - You bet! Will you be proud if I become... Not "if I become". "When I am." Come and see! What do you think? Not a lot. Is it cute or totally dumb? For the Danièles. They're just hats. We'll take that coat. Yeah? Show me. Jo... Holy shit! Look at this! Look! Our anniversary. Nothing's too good. Jo, I wanted to tell you... Yes? This weekend's fun. Let's do it more often. Yeah... Shit, I don't believe it! Jocelyne! Excuse me... It's a woman. That's all we know. She collected the cheque. There's a photo? No. Imagine the hassle she'd get. Just think. At the last minute! Some people... The 75 million win last year was better. 15 of them shared it! Only 5 million each. This is 18 million for one person! A thousand years of the minimum wage. Richer than Kevin Costner! Before the hair transplant. Bye, ladies, I have to run. Have a good day. Bye, Mrs Viguier! No one knows who it is! Even Jean-Jacques's shampoo slut. We'll know when she buys a fancy car. Yeah. Maybe she won't change. Sure! That's what you'd do? Stay here in your shop? No way! You'd buy a house, tons of jewels... You'd be too stuck up to speak to us anymore! Are you nuts? What would you do, Mado? I don't know. But it would be wild. What shall we do? I'm starving from all this emotion. You're making me hungry. Count me out. I have orders to do. You're too good for us with your blog. See you later, Jocelyne. See you later, Mado. Today, I decided to start my list. The list... of my desires. A lamp for the hallway. A bistro-style coat stand. Two non-stick frying pans. A piggybank. (amusing when you have 18 million!) A couscous pot. An Omega watch. A shower curtain (without flowers). Slippers for Jo. A new bag (Chanel or Dior). A new coat... Train tickets for a weekend to see Nadine in London with Jo. A small transistor radio for the kitchen. A new iron... No, a steam generator one! A repairing serum. The Belle du Seigneur special edition. And the James Bond collection on DVD for Jo. You've lost weight. That's good, isn't it? You're dieting? Not even. It's worries then. Too much work. The shop, plus your site. It's too much. Way too much. I just feel good right now. I hope it lasts... Above all, let nothing change. I didn't tell him right away. But things were so good. Here, at the shop, in our life. Love with a capital L. Like when we first met. No, even better... Why would I change that? No! Right out of the blue? Yes. I don't know. I never asked him to... You didn't? - Danièle? - What? Wild, after 20 years... You'll need a full wax now! And anal bleaching too. Not bad! We won't lose you tonight! Let's see. So pretty! Be yourself, Mado! Let's go! This is yours. Welcome to the gang, Mado! To the blog and the shop... And I have something to tell you. I love this! Come on, let's dance! Come on, you two wallflowers! What I say stays here? I listen to you, my daughter, but only God hears. I've won a lot of money. In the lottery. Really a lot. That's all. But I don't see any sin as yet. Maybe a little pride perhaps. No, not at all! I daren't tell anyone. Humility. That's good. I'm afraid of changing. Integrity. Very good. I don't know what to do. What does the Bible teach us? There's no harm in being rich but it's wrong to love money. I don't love it. It freaks me out! It's such a huge amount. How much? 18 million. Not bad... The problem is that it stresses me. My daughter... I see a way... Have you considered our parish charities? The sacristy roof, for instance... Luke says, "Give and you shall receive." And also, "No man can serve two masters." You cannot serve God and money! Wait! We can talk it over! A donation brings you a tax rebate of 66 % of what you give! That's not bad! Shit... You're pulling my leg. What on earth's going on? - What'll you do with it? - I don't know. What do you mean? I'm rich, Dad. So rich I don't know what to do with it all. So scared I can't tell anyone. I'm scared for my life, for the people I love. It's like being ashamed. Anyone would know what to do with that much! You can even get a new life! I love my life. Does your mum know? Hello. We had an appointment. - You'll answer this time? - I'll do my best. Handle customers. - Me? - Yes. All right. Right... Knitting and Internet isn't ancient versus modern. I'm all for progress. But people are more isolated. The blog brings them to the shop to give people a place where they can meet. You realize what these women expect of you? I mean... Excuse me... Jocelyne, extra thin laces? Just there. I mean... you haven't just answered a demand, you've created a need now. I'm not Mother Teresa just because I started a blog. I like my simple life. I wish everyone had one like it. As a minimum. That's all. A sort of Guaranteed Minimum Happiness? Exactly. That's the perfect conclusion. See, it's not so hard. I'll get back to my customers. Anything else you want to say? Something personal you've never told anyone? - A secret? - For instance. Something hard to live with? That it would be a relief to confess? I'm just a journalist, you know. But go ahead if it will help. Something that will change the way you look at me? Maybe not. You see... "Crystallization..." "The crystallization zone." "The crystallization zone is attained "as quickly as needed "to keep the product's temperature at the same level." "After thermal stabilization..." "After thermal stabilization at levels... "at levels equivalent to or below "-18 centigrade." - We have to do this now? - It's for your course. I want you to succeed. You deserve the job. What would you do, Jo, if I told you? - Work hard. - Yes. Would you keep learning those big words? Keep getting up at 5 am? No... You'd say there's no need. I want you to earn success. I need to admire you. In any case, I'm not rich. I just own a bit of paper with 18,547,301 euros and 28 cents written on it. - Hi, girls! - Hi! Enough to pay for a new life, a new TV, a new house... Lots of new things perhaps. But nothing different. Nothing better. - Hurry! - How do I look? - Who cares! - You're right! Are we late? No, look. I'm trembling all over. 9,999! Today's 25th order. This week's 112th! You'll be a millionaire! Like Kevin Costner! It'll be any second, I can tell. 10,000! - Bravo! Congratulations! - Thank you, Mrs Viguier! - Your article did it. - No, you did. 10,000 visits in one day. You'd need a huge store for that! I can't believe it! Look out! Is that it then? Can I congratulate my wife? No thanks. Well done. Down in one! Go on, Mado! Jocelyne, a speech! Let's have a speech! A speech! I have something to tell you. Something I'd like to share with you. Jo, come here. It concerns you too. I'm going to cry... Mado... Sometimes, we'd like to change lives, so we look at others' lives on TV, in magazines, around us... and wonder, "Why not me?" Some just dream, thinking it'll never happen, and others... Move their asses! Exactly. She said it. And some people are lucky. And I've been luckier than anyone. Lucky to have you at my side, Jo. So cute! You worked so hard to give us a good life. Remember? You wired the house, put in the heating, closets and flooring... Every night, every weekend, after work. While I made curtains and put up wallpaper. No furniture for two years. Except the bed. Obviously. But we were happy. We'd earned our home. Like this shop, this blog, these people around us... Thank you. That's priceless. Here's what I wanted to tell you. Jo is off to Switzerland tomorrow to finish his training course. When he gets back... he'll be a foreman, a supervisor with Häagen-Dazs! What a day! That's what I wanted to tell you. All I want is for him to keep on loving me. That's all I ask. Come on, let's have a drink! Open the bar! Thank you. For all you've done for me. For putting up with me. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing, I... I don't deserve you. Stop talking rubbish. I'll think hard about you. It'll go well, my love, and we'll have a good life. Go on, you'll miss your train! Here... The list of my desires with 18 million in the bank. Sexy red lingerie for Jo. He loves that. Redecorate the living room with a flat-screen TV. See Johnny Hallyday live. A foie gras party with the twins talking about sex. Invite the journalist to dinner and give her mum a present. Be told... You're beautiful. A tropical vacation with Jo. No! A week in London with Nadine. Share her life, cuddle each other. Send money to Romain and dare to say that his girl is ugly, common and ugly again. Have a day at a spa. What else? A full-time nurse for Dad able to start a new conversation every 6 minutes. Cultured. Pretty. A Porsche Cayenne... No, I put that already. - Pick you up at 9? - Ok! Two more days and your man will be back. For now... Let's party! Baby, it's me. I left a message last night. Your phone doesn't work there but you'll get it when you come back. I wanted to say I'm thinking of you and... Honey? Coming! I hope it's going well. See you soon. I miss you. I want to make love. Do things like the other night. I want to kiss you all over! I have a surprise here for you. Something totally wild. Honey... What's up? The cheque in the shoe. Are you sure you're ok? There was a cheque in this shoe. Ok. And? It's gone. All right. And you're worried. In a shoe is kind of... Alain? It's Jocelyne Guerbette. Am I disturbing you? No. But it is kind of late. Something wrong? I'm a bit worried about my husband's course in Switzerland. Where? In Switzerland! Switzerland? No, in Paris. In Switzerland, to become a supervisor. Jocelyne, the course is next month in Paris. No, he's gone to Switzerland! I don't know... Aren't you with him? He took 2 weeks off. He didn't take time off. He's in Switzerland. On a course there! Stop bullshitting me! Shit, honey, I knew it. I said so, Danièle. "He'll leave her for a prettier girl." Younger. You said younger. Come on... He's not on a course. There never was a course. He's taken all my money. Cry, it'll do you good. We're here... How long had he known? How long had he been lying to me? Where is he? It depends how much dough he took. 18 million... Shit... Why didn't you tell us? I mean, it's us... I wanted to. I didn't know how. More. You thought we'd beg? Sure, that's our style. No. I knew the money was poison. I was scared... it would change everything. - Such as? - My life. Sorry, but take a look around. I'd found my own happiness. That's all. So? Couldn't your happiness plonk its ass down on 18 million? I must be dreaming! I want to die. Where is he? Partying with 19-year-old hookers. Bastard. Why didn't you tell him? Imagine his look on waking up and seeing his Cayenne parked outside? For a guy, a fancy car is like a jewel for a chick. He'd have been hooked. I wanted him to buy his own car. I thought if I bought it for him... What? That he'd take off in it? That he'd have no more dreams. He'd have had rich guy's dreams instead of dumb ones, that's all. You didn't know what to do with it. He took it. Same difference. I'm not crying over the money. I want to stop hurting. I'll add something to my list. I want to drop dead! Cut it out. I just need to find a way. Go to bed now. Go on. Where's my list? Go to bed, I said. Sure, so you can screw up once our backs are turned? Over my dead body. I'll do what I want. So will I. Shit! Fuck... Danièle... What the hell have you done? - What's up? - No idea. - What did you say? - Not a thing! She's a bundle of nerves! You were supposed to watch her! - No, I'll drive! - Ok! I don't know what happened. I blinked and she was gone! You're useless! She moves fast. - You screwed up! - A bit. Be careful! - Look out! - You scare me! No, you scare me! - Don't lose her. - Shut your mouth! - Where's she going? - No idea. - Shit, the belfry! - What? Shit, the belfry! Jocelyne! Wait for me! Shit, it's too high! Stop! This is crazy! We're here! We love you! I didn't ask you to follow me! It's too high! You'll kill us. Jocelyne! Where are you? Leave me. I want to die. Very romantic. Betrayed by her husband, she leaps from the belfry and lands on a stroller. Two dead, one a year-old baby. That's horrible. Make your mind up. Suicide is always a little selfish. Got a better idea? Pills? Remember Ghislaine Dubreuil? Stomach pumped three times. Her gut flora got power-hosed. - All she can eat now is yoghurt. - Yuck. The train then. No way. It delays people every time. See, you're not ready. So I'm condemned to suffer, is that it? When things are bad, take a walk on a beach. It does the trick. We're not walking. But we're going to. - How about him? - No thanks. He has a gut. We've seen worse today. We've seen better too. Too hairy. - You're no spring chicken either. - Thanks. He's no hunk but we've been here a week. Stop being picky. Don't mind me. I love people who think they're alone in the world! It's better than indifference. Nobody's perfect, ok. You just have to make a move. These bulls want to be grabbed by the horns. No, I don't want anything. Leave me alone. I've lost everything. If you think I'll pounce on a stranger, belly or no belly... Don't worry. A married man never goes far. She's right. Be stronger than that. I'm sick of it! I've been strong for years and that didn't help. This proves it. What do you do in cases like this? - I get blind drunk. - Done that. Or I pick up women. But I won't get anywhere here. Let's walk. We need to walk. It clears the mind and gives you a new outlook. Wait for me. What a drag! Won't he get the message? Now it's just us girls, is a little hair a turn-off? No, it's cute. Like everything, it depends on the person. I waited so long for your call. You mustn't say things like that. You really mustn't. You mustn't! Are you ok, honey? - Danièle... - What? She's driving me crazy. We didn't sleep a wink. Neither did we. I know, thanks. Come on in. I'm awake now. You've really no idea. What's wrong? - Is she in a bad way? - Worse. She wants breakfast at the Negresco! Good morning. Accept it, honey. He's not likely to turn up today, ten years after. I know he was a regular. But that regular would be kind of pathetic. After 3 hours of daiquiris, enough! Know where this cocktail comes from? New Jersey? Cuba. An American was working in an iron mine called Daiquiri. Is that true? An admiral took the recipe to the USA. Incredible... Screw that! We're talking to our friend! Honey... If he was real, what did he want? To get laid like anyone. You have to draw a line now and move on. We can't stay here forever. Think of life. Think of life, your shop... Your blog... And your kids too... My kids... Be brave, Mum. I can't. I can't do it. It'll come back. Like an appetite. It's all my life. What about you? I'll be ok. You'll do well, Mado. I need to rest. I need to... For two months, the blog was flooded with kind messages. Then they slowly stopped. Only natural. I didn't reply. Mado did well at the shop while waiting for me to get back. Good evening and welcome to this draw that will be simply exceptional. I don't want to go back. It's ready... Come and eat. 87 million... Coming? One question: are you ready? Yes? So let's start tonight's draw... Eat, it'll do you good. Tonight's first number: 5. The second number: 7... Stop it, Mum... You know it hurts you. Number 19... Nadine is an angel. She never blames me and never judges me. She's waiting but at least she knows what for. All I do is live as that's all I can do. I'm no better at living than at dying. And the days pass, the months, the seasons... That spring, Danièle married the guy from the beach. That was the only outing I had. I realize I still don't know his name. Daniel Jean Hubert Martinot... Daniel, that's it. Things always turn out well... except for me. I do. No, I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired. Nadine takes good care of me. I don't want to see anyone. Take care. Love to Danièle. I have no excuses. I only have good reasons. I'm not good at complicated speeches but... I thought we could talk about it. I wanted to write to you... But, you know... So I came here. I didn't understand why you didn't tell me. I thought you were waiting for the cheque. Then you came back from Paris. We went to Etretat. And you still didn't tell me. I tried to find a reason but I couldn't. 18 million and we change nothing? I worked it out more than once to be sure. 650 years at the plant to make that! Think I love my work that much? Think I'd do it if I had a choice? I've slaved away, with nothing in return. Never any gifts! Never any windfalls! I know, I should have trusted you. That's what lovers do. You see the glass half full. I saw our account half empty. I imagined all kinds of stuff. That you'd give the money to charity, muscular dystrophy, the Red Cross... That you'd invest it abroad. That you had another guy. That I'd wake one day to find you gone. I thought I had to act fast. And save my hide. I erased the final "e" of your name on the cheque. Jocelyn instead of Jocelyne... I started buying everything I could. Suits, loads of watches, a big house with nice furniture... My Cayenne... I ate in fancy restaurants... I picked up easy girls, the kind you pay and who never hold you. I paid a lot but I didn't enjoy it much. I got swindled, I got robbed when I was too drunk... But I didn't care. I still had money. So I carried on. I blew the cash and bitched about everything! Not smart enough, not cooked enough, not big enough, not nice enough! I want another girl, another room, another hooker! I want what I've lost. I've sold what I could. I'm a million or two short. Here. I kept the car to come back here. Can I come in? Was that Dad I just saw outside? No, it's nothing. Cut it out, Mum... It's nothing, ok. Just a guy selling stuff I'm not interested in. Right... But he made you cry all the same. How is he? Like a guy who's betrayed what he cherishes most. Ok, he screwed up but he's back now. Isn't that what you wanted? I didn't want it to happen. He didn't leave with my money but with all the rest. How could he think I'd rob him? He didn't know who I was. And I don't know who he is, you see? Are you sure? Fetch him if you want. I can't. Nadine did what she could but Jo had vanished. He lived for a while in his Cayenne, used his card once or twice until he emptied out his account. Then nothing. Nadine finally accepted it. After all, he didn't try to see her. Cheques like this are few and far between. Mrs Guerbette, after you. I've added my home number. For emergencies. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What'll you do now? What I should have done right away. Buy your brother a restaurant and give you what you need to make films. And give Mado her chance like I was given mine. I think I'm going to cry. It's now or never, Mado. Let yourself go. You deserve a beautiful life. You're a good person. Try to be happy with him. - You'll introduce us? - Promise. Careful... "Him" is Jean-Luc. Let me help you. I expected a more exotic name but that's ok. Ready? A place this exceptional doesn't come free every day, Mrs Guerbette! Pool, solarium, hot tub, private beach with direct access... It belonged to Bernard Tapie. - Who? - Bernard Tapie! It's nice. It's really nice. It's love at first sight? Tell me, Mr Tapie, I wanted to ask you... I've been with him a year now. He's as handsome as when we first kissed. He asks for nothing. I don't love him the way I loved Jo. You don't love the same way twice. But you move on. You have to. I do good around me. I'm loved but I don't love anymore. I'm happy... I think. Know what Friday's jackpot is? - No! - 55 million! Wasted, Jocelyne! Wiped out! Hold on... Imagine we win. - Want to be like her? - Yes. No. Let's not risk it! Time to swim! Let's swim, girls! There she is! - What's her name? - Jocelyne. - What? - Jocelyne. Believe it or not, I couldn't remember your name. - It's stupid. - Dad... What? You chose it with Mum in your dressing room at La Scala before the premiere of Il Trovatore. Her waters broke and I was born for the finale. That's right. Of course... What an evening! You announced it on stage at the end and everyone applauded so Mum could hear from backstage. How do you remember that? You and Mum told me the story so often. That was yesterday and Dad liked his life. As for mine, it stopped and then started again. Almost like before. She'll be worrying where we've got to. The first time I came to the seaside was with her. Our honeymoon. Yes... Put on some cream. The sun's strong today. Hello, miss. Do you live around here too? Yes. Shall we take a walk? All right. Can I help you? Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitling: Eclair Media
