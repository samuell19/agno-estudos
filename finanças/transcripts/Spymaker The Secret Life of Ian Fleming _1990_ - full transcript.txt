(Ian) 'Hurray! Here he comes.' 'The noble knight charges up the hill.' Slays the wicked soldiers of the dark princes army. Chop. Chop. And kills the fire breathing dragon. Neigh! 'And saves the beautiful damsel in distress.' [instrumental music] Ian. Come. Come, moi cherie. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Madam. Little closer, please. I can't shout. I've decided that the time has come for you to go away to school. Broaden your horizons. Receive a proper education. 'It's most certainly what your father would have wanted.' Well, child? Thank you, m-m-m.. Mother. Can't you say it? - M-m-m.. - Dear me. Alright, you may go now. [instrumental music] 'Brave.' Here comes the brave knight, charging down the hill to save the noble lady from the clutches of the evil wizard. Who's the wicked boy then? Hmm. [instrumental music] [wind hustling] [moaning] - Mr. McKinnon, sir. - Yes what is it? I've just been thinking of Professor Einstein's theory on relativity and it occurs to me that when-- Oh, get out of my way, boy. [moaning] - Huh! - Got you. [sighs] Looks like we're surrounded. There absolutely nothing wrong with it this end. Hmm. Must've be ice. Froze the bell push mechanism. I'm sorry, Ian. [engine revving] (Evelyn) This scandal is shameful and degrading, to you to me, to the memory of your father and most of all to the family name. I have now decided that you shall attend Sandhurst Military College. Perhaps a little discipline will do you some measure of good. [indistinct] (male #1) 'Left, right, left, right, left, right, la.' Ian Fleming. Sir. Ordinarily, we do not accept Eton's rejects. However in deference to your mother and your family.. ...I made an exception. [door opens] Lady Caroline, Cadet Fleming. Lady Caroline. My wife. [drum roll] (male #2) 'Parade.' 'Left.' [instrumental music] General Holmsby sent for me. Sir. - Lady Caroline. - Good evening. Well, now, all these volumes here are to be placed on the upper shelves. There. 'Alright.' Carry on. [instrumental music] [music continues] Oh! Finished. Is there anything else, ma'am? Oh, I think not. Oh, there is one little thing. Mm. - I really should be going. - Are you quite mad. My family'll have me shot if I'm expelled from another school. - I'm worth it. - But General Holmsby. Away on business. Hmm. Left my damn brief.. Forgot my briefcase. (Evelyn) Once again this scandal is shameful and degrading to you, to me, to the memory of your father and most of all to the family name. I have now decided that you shall join Reuters. [typewriter clacking] [indistinct chattering] Come in. Can I help you? 'Ian Fleming to see Mr. Fowler.' Oh, yes. He's expecting you. This way. Mr. Fleming to see you, sir. Let me be perfectly blunt, Mr. Fleming you have this job because of your mothers friendship with our esteemed proprietor. I don't like being subtle with dead wood. - Sir, I-- - 'Please.' Not a word. I've seen your kind all my life. The ideal aristocracy and their offspring. Pampered, spoiled and useless. Alright, Miss Delaney will show you around. - Thank you, sir. - For what? The truth. [typewriter clacking] [indistinct chattering] - What's this? - Obituaries, dear boy. But these people aren't dead. Of course not. Do you think we wait for the bodies to drop? Not very practical. Update them. Look. Imagine the person in question dies now, today.. ...what would we send out for the next edition? How clever. [typewriter clacking] Ian, Lord Dawson went to his eternal reward last night please tell me you've done him? [indistinct chattering] Ian, rewrite. - How do you want it? - Better. Fleming! Oh, come here. Shut the door. Just been looking at your record. - Academic that is. - Oh, dear. Now, you excelled in female anatomy. And languages. French, Italian, German, Russian. And that was just the women. Very impressive. Just a knack, sir. Born with it I suppose. Oh, which? The language, or the women? Both. Sit down, Fleming . Now, you've heard about these British engineers in Moscow. Certainly, sir. Arrested for espionage. Yeah, well, our man in Moscow Roberts has his hand full. He wants another reporter out there to cover the trial one who speaks the language. You leave tonight Berlin Express. Get going. Thank you, sir. Hey. And don't let me regret this decision. Moscow? Thank you, Delaney. Whatever do you mean? Well, who gave him my records? Who else but you had access to them? What a shocking lead it was too, Ian. Whatever is it that make these women fall at you feet so readily? Perhaps when I get back from Moscow I'll show you. Promises, promises. Train tickets, press credentials, expenses. You lucky man. Travel, adventure, far away places. And I'm stuck in dreary London. Oh, Ian. Do be careful. [train whistle blaring] [instrumental music] [music continues] Forgive me but, there does not seem to be another table. Certainly. Please, do sit down. You are most kind. I am Gallina Ileana Karpova. Fleming. Ian Fleming. I must confess something. I saw you before in your compartment. What were you doing? Yes, uh, my meditation. An eastern discipline. I learnt it directly from the last Sarina. She was a person of great spiritual strength. Are you a princess? Please. Please, my young friend. Your-your discretion would be most appreciated. Those days are long gone. A toast. To those long gone days and to a very lovely lady. How romantic you are, Mr. Fleming. Is that what it is. All this time, I thought I was merely a foolish dreamer. On the contrary. I too will confess something. I knew you were watching me. But your eyes were closed. Exactly. [instrumental music] (Gallina) 'Ian, listen to me.' 'This trail you are covering be very, very careful' 'what you write.' This is my address if you should need my help. Thank you. But I don't think it'll be necessary. I'm a reporter they wouldn't dare-- You do not understand. They dare anything. [instrumental music] - Your lips. - What? What about them? They're cold. Make them warm. [music continues] I simply don't understand. Why would the British engineers sabotage the Soviet factories they worked so hard to set up. They wouldn't. You see Stalin's five year plans are a complete disaster. He's looking for a scapegoat. Blaming it on foreign imperialism. - The engineers are innocent. - Certainly. Uh, Fleming, this is a show trail. (male #3) 'You are charged with crimes against the people and property' 'of the union of Soviet socialist republics.' 'Specifically by the defendants all British employees' have engaged in sabotage and wrecking. Before we hear your pleas let me add a personal note. As far as this country is concerned 'you are only manure to the soil' 'of our holy Soviet earth.' [crowd cheering] Proceed. What say you to the charges? - Innocent. - Innocent. - Innocent. - Innocent. - Innocent. - Guilty. [indistinct chattering] [dramatic music] [crying] Maya. No. No. [music continues] I do not understand this. "In the great tradition of George Ewart Bean." Who is he please? A great American jurist. Highly respected. [indistinctchattering] [typewriter clacking] [indistinct chattering] [dramatic music] [glass shattering] [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] - Who are you? - A friend. Please, let me in. - How did you-- - Never mind about that now. Who are you? What do you want? My name is Fleming. Ian Fleming. I'm with Reuters. You're a reporter? If they see me with you. - You must leave. - Maya. Why did Mr. Morrison plead guilty? Is he guilty? - Come on. Is he? - No. No. He did it for me. They threatened him by holding me hostage. Said they would send me to labor camp if he didn't confess. Now, listen to me. I'll write the story and send it to the rest. - No, no, you mustn't. - Maya. Once the story is out they'll not dare to continue this persecution. 'The British, Americans will apply pressure fiercely.' Why look just yesterday the home office announced a trade embargo on Russia. [sobbing] 'You're in love, aren't you?' We wished to be married. 'Then this is your only chance.' If found guilty you'll be sent to Siberia. [typewriter clacking] Hey, you! What are you doing? Just a little piece. Trying to win the deadline war. You won't tell, will you? [whistle blows] [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] [music intensifies] Fleming! - Who do you think it was? - What's going on? The police are all over looking for you. If I don't get back, make sure this story reaches the west. - Fleming-- - There's no time for that. Goodbye, Roberts. [dramatic music] Gallina? Gallina? Gallina? I've got to get you out of Russia. Can you? Yes, I have friends. They can help me. I-I don't know how to thank you. You are a fool. I warned you, didn't I? [instrumental music] [music continues] [dramatic music] [tires screeching] [speaking Russian] [music continues] Bitch! [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] [whistle blows] [music continues] [speaking Russian] [gunfire] [firing continues] [glass shattering] [grunting] [speaking Russian] [grunting] [whistle blows] [speaking Russian] [music continues] [grunting] [music continues] [train horn blaring] [intense music] [announcing in Russian] [music continues] [announcing in Russian] [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] [music continues] [train horn blaring] [music continues] [music continues] [grunting] [speaking Russian] [speaking Russian] [groaning] [horse snorting] Where am I? 'Warsaw.' How are you feeling? How did I.. Found you on the embassy steps. Wrapped in felt and animal fat. White Russians saved your hide, old boy. Oh, yes, Edward Chute, British Consulate. Fleming. Ian. I know. My God, we had written you off. Thought the Bolshies must have sent you to Siberia. The trial...what happened? Oh, that's right, you don't know. Well, they were all found guilty. Thanks to your story, the judge just handed out suspended sentences. They're all home. Safe and sound. 'And there's more.' 'Morrison, remember him?' Left with a woman, Russian girl? Married now, living in London. Romantic, eh? [whistle blows] - Good to see you alive. - Thank you, sir. Now, this young lady is from the admiralty. 'She'd like to have a few words with you.' Ian Fleming. Pleased to meet you. Miss? Leda St. Gabriel. [instrumental music] Would you come with me please? Go on. Hey? Well done. Ian Fleming, Admiral Godfrey. - How do you do? - How do you do? Ms. St. Gabriel, would you like a drink? I'll have a martini please. Shaken not stirred. I'll have the same. Mr. Fleming, we heard about your adventures in Russia. We're most intrigued. We? Any information, impressions, ideas could be very useful to us. Would you read this and sign it before you say anything? (Ian) 'What's all this about?' It's the Official Secrets Act. Anything you say from now on is considered privileged information. For our ears only. Why, you're a spy. What fun. Am I to assume this information will be used for intelligence? You may assume whatever you wish. Please begin. The Soviet Union is first and foremost a land of people who've been brought, kicking and screaming into the 20th Century. And it is there.. How shall I put this? 'Love of excess.' Which makes them the most bitter of foes, or the best of allies. - Anything else? - 'Yes.' A woman with cold lips is to be avoided at all costs. Thank you very much. You've been most enlightening. When war comes His Majesty's government requests that you make yourself available for extraordinary duty. Surely you mean if war comes. No, Mr. Fleming, when it comes. Ms. St. Gabriel? No, Mr. Fleming, I will not have dinner with you. Nor would I like to go to the cinema or theater. Goodbye. So what do you think of him? Perfect. I had a conversation with your Uncle Robert. He seems most enthusiastic about my idea. I will not give up my job for a boring, stuffy position with a family bank. 'Fine.' Have it your own way. - Here we are. - What are those? Your bills for the last month. They're now your responsibility. Your tailor, boot maker, cigarette maker.. 'Oh, yes, and here's a bill from a London farrier' Expensive women, Ian, takes lots of money to keep that kind happy. You're blackmailing me. Time to grow up, Ian. Make your own bed and sleep in it. I'm happy at Reuters. Nonsense. Happiness has nothing to do with our lives. Come on, let's go downstairs. Your father loved to sit in this room. It reminded him of his club. he always said he could just close his eyes and hear all his friends talking. Am I.. Am I at all like him? Not really. He was a hero, you know? Oh, look, who's here. Ian, you remember your Cousin Daphne? How could he possibly remember? I was just an ugly cousin always getting in the way. My, you have grown, Daphne. Lovely to see you. What brings you here? I brought Daphne here. [indistinct chattering] The property lies north-west of the city. And based upon past experiences, and subject to fluctuating market conditions, we anticipate that the property will be sold refinanced or exchanged as soon as.. 'And in all probability in no more than seven years' 'but most certainly, at a time' 'to allow maximum capital appreciation.' [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] [Quincy laughing] How the mighty have fallen. Thank you, Quincy. Yes. Well, you a banker, it's appalling. I must grow up, face my responsibilities. - Fancy a drink? - I'm alright, thank you. I hope that's just what you were doing at Reuters. In fact, I was really rather proud of you. - Really? - Yes, indeed. 'I, uh, I need to borrow your car, Ian..' '...and you to drive it.' Whatever for? For a challenge race, and, well, to test the Quincy booster. This little thing will get you from standstill to 70 miles an hour in 10 seconds. Still tinkering. Well, unlike you, I have remained loyal to my muse. 'What do you say?' When and where? France, this weekend. On a fast open road. The road to Dovehill. 'You'll do it?' Certainly. You could have at least told me who were challenging, Quincy. She's lovely, isn't she? Quite lovely. 'Well..' What shall we wager? [engines revving] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] No! Not on the corner! Only on a straight. Never let die, Quincy. [tires screeching] Ha ha! [speaking in foreign language] [indistinct chattering] [indistinct chattering] Knock again, yeah. Bank wins. [speaking French] Merci, monsieur. [speaking French] [indistinct chattering] Your bets please. [speaking French] - Who is he? - General Gerhard Hellstein. Nazi. They say he's close to Hitler. [dramatic music] Banco. 'Banco' [music continues] How did you get all this money? There are some advantages to working for the family bank. [music continues] [indistinct chattering] [music continues] Whoever gets close to nine wins. [music continues] Card. Carte. 'Five..' Trois. Three. [music continues] [speaking French] (male #4) 'The bank has eight.' Sector seven. The bank wins. [indistinct] Will you be playing again, sir? Afraid not. 'Merci, monsieur. Thank you.' [music continues] [woman moaning] [crying] Hellstein. [crying] Quincy! It's alright. - What happened? - She's hurt. Get a doctor. Quincy! (Quincy) 'Coming.' Who did this? Hellstein. My God! I've just been listening to the radio. 'What?' Hitler has invaded Poland. That means war. [music intensifies] Hello. Oh, I'm sorry. Hello. Who are you? I've been sent by Admiral Godfrey to fetch you. Fetch me? What for? I really don't know. It's all very hush hush. Godfrey, eh? Sounds exciting. What are you doing? [doorbell ringing] I'll get it. My, I am popular. You were sent to fetch this man, not set up housekeeping. - It's not what you think. - 'Ms. St. 'Gab-briel.' 'Gay-briel.' [correcting] Gabriel. Would you care for some scrambled eggs, coffee? Christie here is a wonderful cook. There is a war on, you know. All the more reason for us to behave in a civilized manner. I hardly consider you an authority on that. You're being insulting to me but most of all to Christie. 'The simple fact is I haven't slept in two days.' Just came back from France. And Christie here was gracious enough to allow me to clean up and have some breakfast before reporting for duty. I'm sorry, Christie. You better get back to HQ. I'll take care of Mr. Fleming. Thank you, Christie. Goodbye, Ian. Would you like some coffee? You can hardly blame me for jumping to conclusions. No, I suppose not. The fact is you've been chosen for some very important work. And there's no room for your decadent behavior. I thought my love of women was my most endearing trait. - Certainly my most consistent. - I would hardly call it love. - What would you call it then? - Contempt. [chuckles] You don't know what you're talking about. I know there's no love without friendship. Have you ever made love to a woman who is also your friend? I'll be ready in five minutes. [indistinct radio chatter] Good morning. Come this way, Mr. Fleming. - Delaney. - Ian. How are you? What are you doing here? Drafting for the war effort, and you? I'm the secret weapon. Isn't that right, Ms. St. Gabriel? He's a wicked boy, Ms. St. Gabriel. But not half as frivolous as he'd like us to believe. [buzz] Please go in. You will be my assistant, Mr. Fleming. Your task is to re-initiate intelligence missions. Ms. St. Gabriel is special liaison with the resistance groups in the occupied territory. Now, you two will be working closely together. And I want cohesion, professionalism and cooperation. - Do you have any questions? - Yes, sir. May I ask why you've chosen me? It's our belief that to build a successful intelligence organization we must recruit unorthodox persons. Imaginative men and women. Unpredictable. After hearing about your episode in Russia Ms. St. Gabriel thought you might be just the type we were looking for. Thank you, Ms. St. Gabriel. Don't thank me, Mr. Fleming. I've delivered death to your doorstep. Welcome. My name is Ellis. You're gonna remember me. This way. [military band music] [indistinct chatter] Go. [music continues] (Ellis) 'Alright. In you go.' 'Come on, move yourselves. Move yourselves.' 'Keep going.' 'What's the matter, sonny boy. Now come on.' Do it again, Mr. Fleming. In your own time. Fire! [indistinct] [gunshots] How did you get in here? What is this? That's what I've come to find out. - 'What are you talking about?' - Us. Us? There is no us. All I have to do is turn around and there you are watching, disapproving, like some nasty old nanny. I'd like you to leave. Leda, please. Look, you were my idea. I want to be sure I haven't made a mistake. You think I'll fail. I don't know. [scoffs] You act like my m.. Who? Nothing. Forget it. Ian, what do you want from me? I.. I just want us to be friends. That would take something of a miracle, don't you think? [door closes] Commander Fleming, sir. Are you ready to begin winning this war, Fleming? Yes, sir. Before you start is there anyone you'd like to recruit to the service? So you mean I can actually have my own laboratory? Anything you need. Just let me know. Splendid. But, Ian.. - Yes. - Um.. What exactly they want me to do? Right. Sorry. That will keep you busy. See you tomorrow. - Be inventive. - Yes. So glad you could come, ladies. Well, what do you think? Fleming, who are these people? Prostitutes, sir. Yes, I can see that, but what the hell are they doing here? I sent you a memo. Haven't you read it yet? Fleming, you send me a hundred memos a week. I do not and cannot read them all. Oh, I see. Well, anyway it came to me during the night. Brilliant idea. Recruit some tarts, train them. And drop them on occupied territories. Fraternize with the enemy. This is some kind of joke surely. Hardly, sir. Anna. Anna Skolowmoska. 'May I present Admiral Godfrey, Leda St. Gabriel.' An honor, sir. And where are you from? Warsaw. I am Lilo Schtam from Belgrade. Mia Wozniak. I am from Prague. What do you think? I think we should give it a try. Very well. Carry on. - Thank you, ladies. - Thank you, sir. I will not let you down. - Thank you for your support. - You deserve it. (Ian) 'Fuhrer Gerhard Hellstein.' Obersturmbannfuhrer Hellstein. What about him? We've been contacted by a Portuguese national. 'Countess Leanna De Turbinville.' - She wants to work for us. - 'What's the connection?' She's his mistress. Good God. 'Where is she?' (Leda) 'Lisbon.' [instrumental music] Boa noite, senhor. [indistinct chatter] Martini, shaken not stirred. May I buy you a drink? Leda. Do we know each other? No, I suppose we don't. Well, we better make up for lost time then. Indeed we must. I've made contact. She's genuine. You could've warned me. She's given me some really important documents and one code Whitman's been killing himself over. Should have warned you about what? About you. This. We've set up a rendezvous. When? See for yourself. La banque gagner. The bank wins. [intense music] 'Faites vos jeux messieurs, mesdames.' 'Place your bets.' - Banco. - 'Banco.' [music continues] Six a la banque. The bank has six. 'Sept. Seven.' 'La sept gagner.' 'Seven takes the bank.' Carte. Carte. 'Sept a la banque.' 'The bank has seven.' 'Six. Six.' 'La banque gagner.' 'The bank wins.' 'Faites vos jeux messieurs, mesdames.' 'Place your bets.' - Banco. - 'Banco.' I do not like to lose. What a pity. [crowd exclaiming] (croupier) 'Neuf a la banque. Nine.' 'La banque gagner.' 'The bank wins.' Surely you don't mean to finish so early in the game. It is not a game. (croupier) 'Neuf a la banque. Nine.' La banque gagner. The bank wins. Monsieur. Monsieur! Berlin calling. They said it would take a few moments to make the connection. - Well done. - Thanks. Hello. So you are the agent. Hello! Dah! I have classified material from Hellstein. I stole it, copied it myself and gave it to the girl. You can check it out. And you will see it is authentic. But can we trust you? You would be a fool if you didn't. We would make a wonderful team, won't we? My most fervent desire. [intense music] Unh! Ian, she's a.. I know. - I won. - What? Hellstein. Cleaned him out. Dammit, Ian, I was worried about you. She would've killed you and all you can talk about is some damn card game. Oh. How'd you know the countess being a plant? Her lips were cold. [intense music] Here we are. Welcome home. Well, goodbye. Goodnight. [instrumental music] Ian! [instrumental music] [door closes] (male #5) 'But, Herr General' 'he has helped transform the outmoded intelligence service' and turned it into a formidable machine. Now it is his turn to lose. Code? German. Odd and even sequence. Odd number blocks stand for letters A through Z. Even numbers stand for numbers one to ten. It's too simple really. Any mathematician worth a salt could spot. Exactly what I thought. Very well, commander. Proceed. Thank you, sir. [knocking on door] Come in. You wished to see me, Commander Fleming? (Ian) 'Ah, yes. They tell me you're a prized pupil, Anna.' - I have tried. - 'I know you have.' And now it's time to put that valuable training to good use. - I am to go over? - 'Tomorrow morning.' Thank you. Thank you for believing in me. For giving me a chance. You deserve it. Goodbye then. Goodbye. Good luck. You think she'll be alright? Will any of us? (male #6) 'Use your elbows! Pull your way through!' Keep your backsides down! Halt! Commander! 'Good to see you, sir!' What can I do for you? (Ian) 'This is the target. Castle Helmstaedt, Norway.' Central archives for German intelligence. Now I'm told it's impregnable. I'm also told that no right-thinking soldier would even attempt an assault on this target. We'd follow you to hell, sir...and back. Thank you, Ellis. - How do we get there? - 'Good question.' - Quincy. - Oh, right. Uh, the Quincy Subaqueous Torpedo Transporter. [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Are you sure about this? Absolutely. I do apologize. You must think me so very rude. Mrs. Fleming. So, Ian, this is your little friend? How do you do? I don't believe I know your family, Ms. St. Gabriel. Highly unlikely, Mrs. Fleming. My father's a grocer in Lancashire. You're a scholarship girl. Commendable. (Ian) 'Leda read History at Oxford.' Hmm. How nice. Do tell me, are you a secretary at the Admiralty? No. As a matter of fact, she's-- I'm sorry, but we really mustn't talk about this. Oh, dear, we are serious, aren't we? Oh, Ian, look who's come to see you. [footsteps approaching] Ian, hello. (Ian) 'Leda St. Gabriel, my cousin Daphne Winslow.' - Hello. - How do you do? [cutlery clinking] [telephone ringing] (male #7) 'Telephone call for Ms. St. Gabriel, madam.' No. No, I'll tell him. [instrumental music] Well, do say something, Leda, please. [music continues] There's nothing between Daphne and me. That's not the point. What do you mean? Your mother. Well, she'll come around. I don't want her to come around. I'll not be thought of as something your family has to tolerate. Something they'll have to get used to. Bloody aristocrats! I've worked hard all my life and yet you people treat us like dirt. I love you. Ian, please. Well, do you love me? Do you love me? Ian, Anna was captured. What? Anna Skolowmoska was captured by the SS. - 'When?' - We're not sure. 'What happened? Well...is-is she--' She's dead, Ian. Tortured. God forgive me. Detailed views of the cliff's geological data inside layout of the castle weather reports and tide watch for the past ten years. Wonderful. Splendid work, Leda. Thank you. Managing an operation in those waters will be pretty dicey. - We should call in the RAF-- - No! Absolutely not. They'll go blow the place to hell. - Ian, don't you think-- - I want those archives. The bloody gold mine of intelligence. Don't you think you're being little-- 'What? Overwrought?' Why? Because General Hellstein tortured a young girl to death? It's war. You said so yourself. Ian, don't get personal. It'll work against us. This one is my show. Leda. You blame me for not standing up to my mother. I'm a coward. That's what you think, isn't it? You are who you are, I am who I am. That's the joy and that's the tragedy. We've got to talk, Leda. There's nothing more to be said, Ian. Training going well, is it? Quite well, sir. I didn't really believe in you at the start I didn't think you had what it takes. But Ms. St. Gabriel said you did. Relentlessly, I might add. 'She said you had it all.' Imagination, ingenuity, creativity, bravery. Stuff to win the war. And she was quite right, of course. But I still can't help asking myself can I send you on a mission just one step short of suicide? I must lead it, sir. I cannot...will not send my men out on a mission which I wouldn't risk myself. Neither would I. Don't get yourself killed, commander. Ms. St. Gabriel would never forgive me. Thank you, sir. [door closes] [knocking on door] - Can I come in? - Uh. What time do you leave? Eleven o'clock. What's this? A present. Oh, Ian. [instrumental music] How did you know? [music continues] I love you. I want to marry you. [instrumental music] (Leda) 'I'll be waiting for you when you get back.' (Ian) 'You mean, you'll marry me?' (Leda) 'Yes.' [instrumental music] Your lips. What about my lips? They're...burning hot. Lucky me. [music continues] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [sloshing] [music continues] [wind whooshing] [wind whooshing] [waves crashing] [wind whooshing] [wind whooshing] [grunts] [wind whooshing] [grunts] [wind whooshing] [waves crashing] [waves crashing] [wind whooshing] [coughs] [sloshes] [man screaming] [splashes] [wind whooshing] [static on radio] [wind whooshing] [grunts] [grunts] [gunshot] [gunshots] [grunts] [wind whooshing] [footsteps] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [intense music] [dramatic music] [gunshots] [intense music] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [groans] 'Halt!' [speaking in foreign language] [gunshots] Okay. [intense music] [music continues] As you can see, I've planned a whole new field of operations in our intelligence network. Forgive me, Herr General, but, uh this assassination will serve no practical purpose. On the contrary, it'll spread terror into their backyards. [dramatic music] Heil Hitler! [glass shattering] [shouting in foreign language] Come on! You? As you said, it is not a game. [beeping] Mission accomplished. (Godfrey) 'One casualty. Ellis.' "I've not only captured German intelligence archives "but in addition.. ...Gerhard Hellstein and several SS generals." I'm impressed, General Hellstein. Your intelligence work is quite remarkable. But what does this red mark indicate? It's assassination, isn't it? I'm marked for assassination. I'm flattered. Really. Look at all the fine company I'm with. It's today. I was to be killed today. [all laughing] [beeping] 'Urgent, sir.' Call Ms. St. Gabriel tell her not to go near Fleming's flat. Sir? 'Just do it!' [intense music] The line's dead. [tires screeching] [tires screeching] Leda! Oh, thank God. [screaming] [melancholic music] Ian. [music continues] I-I.. It's a miracle. You're alive. Miracles do happen, don't they? Especially to people like us. Do you remember when you said you wanted us to be friends and I said it would take a miracle? Yes. You're my miracle. [music continues] 'I love you.' Sleep now. [instrumental music] [door bangs] (Delaney) 'Feeling better, commander?' Where's Leda? Where is she? She was just here. I.. She's dead, Ian. What? The bomb. [scoffs] She was just.. ...just here. I.. She said I was.. [melancholic music] [music continues] Ian darling, how lovely to see you. How are you? I've brought you a present. Why? What's the occasion? Open it and see. Go on. Ian, I never said this to you before but I am terribly sorry about what happened to the girl. Leda. Her name was Leda. Open the gift, please. Well, not that the war is over I suppose we shall have to start thinking about a career for you. I think I'm going to write a book. - A fantasy of sorts. - 'Are you listening to me?' You have no money. No job and no prospects. What do we do about it, hmm? Don't worry. I won't ask for a penny. [instrumental music] Your father gave this to you, didn't he? What shall I do with it? [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues]
