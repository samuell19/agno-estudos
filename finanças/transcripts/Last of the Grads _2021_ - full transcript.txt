Oh my god! Oh my god! Help me! Help me! Henry! What are you doing?! Wake up, you old bastard. There you go. Morning. What the hell?! Don't you see me, Pa? I've got the burning! You're dead, boy! You won't be able to walk when I'm done! Please, no, Henry. Please. What are you doing? What are you doing, Henry?! No! Henry, why? Why? Please. Please, I'm sorry. Henry, please. Heard it's real warm down there. Have fun, you old bat. Sweet dreams. They said the age of legends had ended. I've proven them wrong. As the house at the edge of the world draws near, I'm leaving this message so that my story will never leave the lips of man. 25 years ago, in a rotting town in Washington, there was a boy who lived inside the stories of others. Henry! Henry lived alone with his mother, a woman with a heart of ice and a witch's temper. Just what do you think you're doing? One degree higher and I will die! Is that what you want, Henry? Do you wanna kill your mother? Speak up! No, Ma. She told him his father was sick of them and left in the night to walk the earth alone. He hid the postcard his father left for him, with his life. At the age of 13, Henry found himself in the company of another lost soul. This boy was an animal. The rage that swelled inside overcame him like a demon. His name was Mutt. They hid from the world to share their secrets. Drink. Mutt told Henry about his beastly father and how he would beat him at the drop of a hat. Sit down, boy! Oh, I got the burning in me, Marty! And this time, I got it good! He explained that the anger inside had tormented him, even in his dreams. He showed Henry the scars on his palm, a symbol from a nightmare. "This is the burning," Mutt said. "It lives inside of us. People like me, people like you." This was my mama's. She used to wrap me in this when I was a baby. It still smells like her. What are you doing? Her memory was killing me! You get that. Do you? That's it, Henry. Do it. Do it! What was that?! Are you gonna let a ghost run your life?! Huh?! My father is still out there! And if you say any different, I'll bash your fucking- - At the mention of his father, Henry felt an unnatural anger. Hold it! He accepted the carving by Mutt's own hand. Henry, what is your dream?! I'm gonna go down to the Keys and track down my pa! I'm gonna find that bastard, or die trying! How about you? Me?! I'm gonna die a legend! Home already? I know you've been out with that Henderson boy again. Show me those hands. Show me those hands! Oh, Lord, Henry. Witchcraft?! You know you'll die and go to hell, don't you? I guess I'll find out when it happens. One fateful night, Henry and Mutt met to plan their revenge on their tormentors. As the righteous fire roared through the flesh of the damned, Henry and Mutt reaffirmed their oath. "It's just you and me, Henry, all the way down the line." A Lakeshores family is pleading for help in the search for their family member who's been missing since Tuesday. They were greeted by a gruesome sight. His body was found cut up and mangled on his couch. Suddenly, she told him she thought someone else was in the house with her. It's been four days. Police have ruled out suicide. She was already dead. Still waiting on some answers to her whereabouts. Our station, along with other news outlets from across the country, has received a package containing a series of anonymous letters written in blood. The author has claimed responsibility for over a dozen unsolved and seemingly unrelated murders over the past 25 years, and has promised he will strike again soon. The person, now known nationwide as the Coast to Coast Killer, has sent out another cryptic letter to the press, taking credit for yet another series of unsolved murders today. Investigators have continued to maintain that due to the public knowledge of these crimes and the implausibility of one person being responsible, the Coast to Coast Killer is almost certainly a hoax. But the question remains, who would pull a stunt like this? When asked for comment, the head of the investigation responded, "At this time, we have no reason to believe these claims are anything but an elaborate hoax." Our top story, local elementary schooler, Tommy Klein, has been reported missing today when he didn't return home from middle school. If you happen to know anything that could help with this case, please, contact the Shelby Police Department. Our prayers go out to the family, and we keep them in our thoughts. Don't you see? If you take the heat map for homicides over the past 25 years and you plot out where it increases the most over time, we get a straight line that leads us right here. You don't actually believe this delusional, tinfoil condom conspiracy shit, do you, Sheriff? No. Sounds like a bunch of bullshit if you ask me. But the reports, the letters in the news. Every few years, some limp-dicked, turbo virgin loser watches one episode of "Unsolved Mysteries" and tries to take credit. It's a waste of time, Jordy. With all due respect, Sheriff, I really don't think those kids should be alone in that high school. This fucking guy. What do you wanna do, shut it down? I don't know. Yes. Maybe. The lock-in's been a Shelby tradition for nearly 50 years, okay? It's all these kids have to look forward to. You really wanna go screwing with that over a hunch? It's more than a hunch, Sheriff. Look. We see, Jordy. God, I hope you're not showing that to any women. Rookie, listen. Let's say with all those tabloid parasites printing about this 25-year coast to coast killing spree is for real, right? - And it's not. - And it's not. But supposing it was right, that'd make this son of a bitch the greatest serial killer the world's ever seen, right? Make the Zodiac look like a joke. I know. See? He knows. Jordy, listen. I know we're all upset about what happened to little Tommy Klein. That kind of shit don't happen around here, not in our town. Until it does. Granted. Let me tell you something. In my 20-odd years experience, I've seen some crazy shit out there. Some things I wouldn't wanna recount. Some things I can't even explain. I'll tell you this, I ain't never seen anything that look like that. Look, I need you to listen to me. All right? This right here is all a fairytale. Rookie, you're chasing ghosts. - What? - You know what. It's just a day, Donna, like any other. - Woo! - Hey! - Hey, looking good! - Woo! Woo! Oh, yeah, that was close! Yeah, for sure. You'll get it someday, buddy. - Come on, don't play with me. - You'll get it. Yeah, okay, I'll get it. Stone! What the hell are you doing, man?! You trying to blow your Achilles right before you make the big time? Okay, Coach. - Sorry- - Don't "Coach" me! How stupid are you? Those legs ain't yours no more, man. That's property of Iowa State! And I don't like when I see you wrecking other people's property! You understand that? Yeah, I know, Coach. Yeah, they all know, till they don't. I'll make sure to remember that, Coach. You better! Yo, come on, Steve. Duty calls. Yeah, he knows. - Ladies. - Thanks, Mr. Russo. Anytime. Motherfuck. Hey! Time and place, huh?! Hey! You can't keep sneaking in here! Why are you still walking away, buddy? I'm gonna rearrange your face. Have a good summer. Good morning, Stingrays. Welcome to your last day. We hope you enjoy yourselves tonight at the Senior Bash, headed by class president Donna McCormick. By the way, if any of you have seen a ring of janitor keys, please return them to me at the front desk. Thank you. Mr. Weebly. Donna. I love what you've done with this year's Senior Bash. It's gonna be a smash. I think so too. Emma. Emma. Emma. Hey, Emma. Off in the clouds again? Just got a lot on my mind. Tell me about it. The dance is in six hours and I haven't decided what I'm gonna wear yet. Aww, you look good in anything, Maddie. Sure, I will, but I'm dressing for two here. You ever try to coordinate your date's outfit before? I think we've got an idea. What a place you've taken me to, Em. What's it called again? Only the best for my darling daughter. Serves you right. Down the Wonder Twins. When it comes to fashion, I'm afraid Benji's hopeless. Ah, you love me anyway. I guess it's not what you wear that matters so much, - it's about how you wear it. - Or how you take it off? Oh, shit. The Coast to Coast Killer just put out another message. Ugh, this again. Wait, listen. The message says, "Call me Mutt. Two burn inside. Find the keys, find the prize. A house by the sea. It's all in the eyes." Can you believe this freak? No, I can't. Gives me the creeps. Oh, baby, I'll protect you. It's a hoax anyway. Just someone trying to scare people. Can we just please stop talking about it? I can't believe this is our last time eating at the Mulch Mound. Oh, how I'll miss the bees and spiders. Goodbye, holy table. May you make many more butts uncomfortable. And so ends the Fellowship of the Lunch Sisters. And friend. Oh, hey now, I thought my hazing period was over. Oh, you're an honorary member for sure. Yeah, he is. Just another one of the girls. That's right. See anything you like? So, Lady Emma finally bit the hook, huh? Who is he? I'll knock his block off. Oh, yeah? - Mm. - Last day! Last day! Last day, everybody. We made it! All those hours, all those days, come on! No one? We got to do this again, don't we? Ah, let's see, let's see. Stacey. What do you have planned for summer vacation? My parents are taking me to Italy. Of course they are. Ah, Italy. Right here. All right. Let's see, someone who can catch better than me. Jet. They got to have a gym where you're going? If I get this cast off soon, I'll be the arm wrestling champ before I know it. Hey, hey, that sounds good. Leroy! I want you to name one thing you've learned in my class this whole year. One thing, one. Go ahead. Always be ready to catch the ball? That's one answer, I guess. Okay, either way, I think we have some very special people in the room right now. Do we have anyone here today who attended Seacrest from pre-K all the way to senior year? Oh, I think we have some people. I think I see one, two. There should be a third. There he is. I'm gonna need Emma Bradley, Donna McCormick, and Stewart Minkle to please stand up. Stand up! Ladies and gentlemen, let us hear it for the lifers, everybody. So you still thinking about taking Alexis to the dance? Nah. Nah, cut that off a couple days ago. Just a fling. - Really? - Yeah. You're still going there, right? Wouldn't miss it. Your boy's on the hunt tonight. There's a couple of different girls I have in mind. Oh, yeah? Like who? Ah, I was thinking a little Lexi Turner action. Tiffany Wales. I was even thinking about going after that Emma chick. Emma Spalding? Pshh. No, man. Bradley. What? She's cute, ain't she? Yeah. Steve. Yeah? I'm fucking with you. You ass. How'd you know? How couldn't I know? - You got it bad, my friend. - Ah, it ain't good. Could be. Better late than never, right? Maybe. I mean, hey, look at it this way, she ain't been asked yet. And at this rate, nobody's asking her, and that sucks, Steve. So, in my mind, you'd be doing her a favor. So nut up or shut up, champ. Line up! You could be right. Of course I'm right, Steve-O. But I'm warning you, if you don't dance with her, I'm gonna have to. - Three! - You really are an asshole. - Two! - That's me. One! Hey, Stewart! Let me sign your yearbook. - What? - Your yearbook. I signed everyone but yours. Great. Sign mine too? Aww. Thanks, Stewart. No problem. Hope you have a good summer. Hey, Stew! Jesus, man. You've been working out, haven't you? Oh, hey, Sarah. Oh, my god, what'd she say? Oh, Sarah, please, please tell me you said yes to Stew here. I'm telling you, this guy's a real mean dancer. Isn't that right, Stew? Huh? Best in the school? I don't know what- - Aww. He asked you yet, has he? So you don't know? - No. - Okay. Well, you see this guy right here, he wants to fuck you. Even told all the boys about it. Said he was gonna take you to the dance, hold you nice and close. And when the lights got down really low, how'd it go, Stu? You'd give her a night she'd never forget? You're a real dick, you know that? Hey, I'll show you a real dick, baby! Stewie, Stewie, Stewie. Stewie. You're fucking pathetic. Well, that's one way to say goodbye. Hello. Mr. Seitz, I... Timmy, you don't need to explain anything. I was your age once. The world had a lot of potential in it. And you have a lot of potential in you. I'm cool. I'm Mr. Seitz. We're cool. You, me, we're buddies, we're friends. Right? Yeah! Let me see. Let me see. Oh, Timmy. You can get in a lot of trouble for this, but not if you leave right now. And I mean in three, - in two, in one. - Thank you, sir. Goodbye! This is some dog shit weed. Oh, my god. All that for this? Why do I even teach anymore? What is the point of this? Emma. Shoot. - Emma. - Oh, my god. Sorry. No. No. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, no, I'm fine. You're this way too? Yeah. Cool. Cool. Well, I'll tell ya, not gonna miss these walks home. What do you mean? Oh, you know, it's just the same thing every day. There's only so many times I can walk the same path, look at the same houses. It gets old. That's funny, I don't think I've ever seen you down this way. Oh, um... Yeah, the track, track keeps me late. - Oh. - Yeah. I come around here though. Mm. What about today? That's something different, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is different. Last day of school and all. Yeah. Oh, is it there? Ah. Yes, it's gone. What's gone? My penny. Well, it's not my penny anymore, but I guess that's the point. Wait, what? Every day, I leave a penny, heads-up, right here. And the next day, it's gone. Ah. Spreading the luck around, huh? Just doing my part. Pretty, right? Yeah. It's just gonna be weird, you know? I can't picture my life without this place. So, when do you take your ticket outta here? Still got to figure that out. Really? I would've had my bags packed weeks ago. What about you? When do you leave? I don't. What about track? You're really good. You think so? Well, not good enough. We can't all be 'breakneck' Bobby Stone. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll get out one way or another, just maybe not as soon as I'd hoped. This is me. Oh, wow, it's... it's nice. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. Emma. Yes? Are you going to the lock-in tonight? I don't think so. You know, loud parties aren't really my thing. Oh. All right. No worries. Well, I'll see you around. Hey! Is this really your way home? The long way. This just in, the name on everyone's mind, the Coast to Coast Killer, may be connected to a mysterious death in the Central Florida area. A reliable source has informed our team that the deceased, 26-year-old Will Davis, had this symbol carved into his palm. As you can see, the symbol is identical to the one displayed in one of the killer's letters. Could they have inspired a copycat, or does he really walk among us? This is the latest in new developments on this bizarre case. Oops. Please remember, lock your doors and exercise caution. - Hey, Dad. - Oh, hey, honey. How was your day? Oh, my god, your last day of high school. Can you believe it? - It was good, yeah. - Oh, good. What are you making? Well, I'm trying my hand at some sweet corn and some turkey in the oven. A little more to it than grilled cheese, but you got to figure it out someday, right? Now would you do me a favor and grab the Old Bay? - Yeah. - My hands are kinda full right now. Oh, thanks, sugarplum. Okay, a little bit of that, little more of that, little bit of this. Oh! Hey. I'd hug you back, but my hands are a little busy. Dinner in 20? Sounds good. Okay. Hey, Donna. So, is it true? Is what true? Rumor has it, Steve Clayton walked you home from school today. Who told you that? I have my sources. Is it true? Yes, it's true. I cannot believe this. Tell me everything. Well, there's not much to tell. I mean, he came up to me and walked with me and we talked. And? And it was nice. It was nice? I mean, did he ask you to the dance? Oh, no, no, no, nothing like that. He asked me if I'd be there, but- - Emma, he was just giving you the shy boy routine. You have to dance with him when you get here. Listen, Donna, about tonight- - Oh Emma no, please don't do this. Do what? I know you wanna coop yourself in your room and try and finish that story again. It's just that this thing's got me stressed out, and I just wanna finish it, you know? Emma, you know I love you, right? Yeah. So trust me when I tell you that what you need right now is some time with your friends. I mean, you can't just, like, bash your head against the wall and expect the answers to come out. You're probably right. Of course I am, Emmalem. Think of it this way, I'll be there, Ben and Maddie will be there, and lover boy too. I mean, it'll be the last time we'll see everyone as classmates. Donna. You guilty yet? All right. All right. For you, Donna, I'll go. Yay! Meet you there, okay? Got to go. Busy bee. Love you. Well? Here we go. Wait, wait, wait. Honey, you don't have to eat that. No. There's microwave mac - and cheese in the fridge. - No, no, no, no, no. No, Dad, it looks great. Mm! You know, it's kinda good underneath the burnt stuff. Really? Mm. I um... I think I'm gonna go tonight. Oh. Okay. I mean, I think if you wanna go, you should go. Mm-hm. I can drive you. What time does it start? Seven. But I still have to pack a bag. Honey, go pack your bag. - I'll take care of the dishes. - Okay. Hurry up! Woo! Woo! Hey, Leroy, you dropped this. Fuck. Ricky. You're too gullible, Leroy. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you'd eat a shit sandwich if somebody told you it's chocolate. All right. I may be gullible, but you're fucking slow. - Think so? - I know so. Yo. Yo, what the fuck?! Fuck. Hey, Dirk, fuck we doing here anyway, man? Last day of school and we're here dicking around like a couple of losers, bro. And what do you suggest we do? I don't know. What, no parties tonight? If there was, we'd be there already. I mean, everyone is at that sleep away circle jerk at school. Man, fuck that. We should go. We bailed on that shit show for a reason, man. Yeah, I know, but we should go anyway, to fuck with them, you know? Like, pull the fire alarm or some shit. Huh. Now that, I like. You ready? Yep. All set. I just... - Emma, you look so beautiful. - Dad, don't. You're so beautiful, honey. Thanks, Dad. Well, we'd better get moving. We're running behind schedule. Thank you. Honey, just out of curiosity, why did you decide to go again tonight? Oh, uh... It's just a big deal to Donna, and I didn't wanna bail on her. Oh. And it's kind of a tradition, you know? What's his name? It's Steve. Steve. Cool! That's cool. It is cool, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cool. - Okay, good. It's cool, Dad. You'd like him. You know, I took your mom to this dance in 1977. I know. I'm just happy that I get to see you do the same, honey. Hey, Greg. They got you on this, huh? Yeah, man, I was investigating Sasquatch sightings per usual and they pulled me off, do a little chaperoning at the school function. That's a good. That's a good one. I'm actually glad that you're here, Greg. I really am. I feel safe knowing that you're protecting our kids and I also appreciate your service. Hey, well, I appreciate the kind words, Mr. Bradley. I'm always looking out for the students. Who do we have checking in here? Is that Emma I see? Hi, Officer Greg. Hello there, Emma. And a little tardy to the party, but that should be just fine. Go ahead and mark you down, you can get you on your way. Thanks, Greg. Keep it up. Thanks, Mr. Bradley. Have a great night. You too. We're here! - Woo! - Woo! - Let's get it. - We're making history, boys! They're gonna remember us! - Yes, sir! - Yeah! Woo! - Woo! - Let's fucking go! - Let's fucking go! - Hey, Leroy, the bag. Oh, yeah. Here. All right, it's all here. Everyone grab yours. - Yo, relax, bro. - Okay, okay, okay, chill out. All right, boys! Let's give them all a good send off! Woo! Have fun, okay? Just be safe. I will. Bye. Ooh, girl, you look great. Donna, you better keep an eye on this one she's a troublemaker. I'll keep her out of trouble, Mr. Bradley. Uh-huh. Have a good time, girls. Donna, you're shaking. I am not. How's it going in there? It's great. It's great. I've gone over this night in my head for weeks, but seeing it in person is surreal. Oh, I'm happy for you. And I'm happy you showed. Yes. Shall we, then? Oh, wait. Happy graduation, bestie. Donna. Don't you love it? Of course. But I didn't get you anything. Who said you had to? Put it on. Oh, I don't know what to say. Now, you'll remember to call me, no excuses. And look. Oh, my... Are you trying to make me cry? Thank you, for everything. She's here. Great news. Great news. Ms. Bradley, you're looking fabulous as always. Come, come. Come, come. We have to get you checked in. I'm gonna need your John Hancock right there. Or should I say your Joanne Hancock? And don't worry, you're not signing your life away. It's just a formality. No problem. Now, some people are having trouble with this next part. We've decided to hold onto your cellular devices. So, send your last text, set up your passcode, delete your history. Do whatever you have to do. No problem. Here you go. All set. We appreciate it. And don't worry, you'll get this back first thing in the morning. All right, let's do it. You girls have a blast! Thank you, Mr. Weebly. - Wow. - Do you really like it? Are you kidding? It's great. Hey, it's the Wonder Twins. There you are! - Hey. - Hey, guys. You guys tearing it up out there? Oh, you bet, sister. This is blast, Donna. You got to come dance with us. We will, we will. Oh, I'm just gonna grab some punch. Yeah, me too. We'll meet you guys out there. - Okay. - You better. Well, ladies, nice night we're having here, huh? Hey now. Come on, what's the problem? Timmy, are you always stoned? Only seven days a week, babe. You put that away. Timmy, if you don't put that away in the next two seconds, I'll have you thrown out of here so fast. No phone, you walk home. Sorry, ladies, I didn't realize I was dealing with the resident narcs. Some party. Creep. It's Timmy. Bonehead probably forgot he even talked to us. You're right. What a dick. Oh, someone spiked the punch. No way. Ugh, it's like Everclear or something. Oh, my god, what am I gonna do? I have to dump it. But if I do, Mr. Weebly's gonna see me. Maybe I can throw it out back? This is not okay. - This is not okay! - No, Donna! Donna. Maybe we can let this one go? I guess... it is the last night. Hey, what's taking so long? You ain't getting it. You ain't getting it. Get the fuck outta my light, Leroy. Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah. Maybe. Yes, there it is. All right, let's do this. Remember, stay close to the wall until we reach the alarm. Once it's done, we'll meet in my car- - Hey, Dirk. - What, Rick? Can't you see I'm fucking talking here? I got to take a leak. Now? You got to take a piss now? Yes, now, I've been fiddling with that shit for 30 minutes. I could fill a lake. I got to go too, man. Fucking amateurs. Fine, go, okay? But if you get caught, I do not know you. - Yeah, yeah. - Un-fucking-believable. - Sorry, Dirk. - Just go, Leroy. And hurry back. Whew. Yo, don't stand next to me! Yo, get outta here. Yeah, forgot you're camera shy. Yeah, keep it moving, you runt. Oh, hey! Dirk told me the good news. Oh, yeah. Who'd have thought, right? A college boy now, huh? Not yet. Soon enough. Of course, me and Dirk are gonna miss you, seeing as you won't be around no more. I'll visit back every once in a while. I hope so. Hey, you know what I just thought about? What? You remember back in eighth grade when you picked a fight with Petey Greenberg? Oh, I'll never forget it, Leroy. Remember when I got suspended for two weeks, and I begged you to let me hide out in your room? Oh, we both got licks for that one. Leroy?! We better be getting back. Dirk's gonna be real pissed off. Hey, remember, Leroy, you're the gullible one, so you're only wasting time trying to scare me. Leroy. Oh, fuck! Oh, no, no! Star Captain Greg's log, chapter 264. It's me again. Today, I got a compliment. God, that felt good. Really just makes it all feel worth it. Worth. What an interesting concept. Who decides what's worth anything in this corporeal dimension we're forced to inhabit? Just some arbitrary value some higher power assigns the materialistic possessions. God, what the fuck happened to you, Greg? You cry when it rains, cry when it doesn't rain, cry when you're dreaming, cry when you're awake. Shit. All right, come on out, guys. Get back to the party and I won't make a big deal out of this, huh? Hm, I guess crime never sleeps. God! Did you catch the twins? Mm-mm, I don't see 'em. Oh, they'll find us. - Damn. - What? My baby looks hot. Careful there, sailor, you might get burned. Oh, I can take the heat, cowgirl. Hey, man, are you gonna dance? Come on, I can juggle the two of 'em just fine, but I'd rather we take 'em together. Hey, look, you can have your pick. Huh? I'm good, Bobby. Don't mind me, man. Listen, Steve-O, dude, I know you're bummed about that Emma chick, but come on, man, you can't let it ruin the night. I hear you, man. I'm just trying to chill right now though. All right. Hey, well, look, as soon as I'm finished with that thing over there, how about you and me go down to the track, finish this guy off, huh? And enjoy one last lap for posterity. Huh? Dude, what about the girls? Fuck 'em. They can wait. Hey, you're crazy. I'll see you out there. That's it, I'm gonna kill these kids. Britney, where are you, bitch?! This isn't the bathroom. - What the hell are you wearing? - Shh. Shh. Let me see that stupid thing. I should've known it was you. Stacey, go back inside. Let me see it. Be careful with that. Brutal. You look kinda dangerous in it. I've seen you looking at me in school. You should've said something. I always thought you were kinda cute. You got one more shot, killer. What's it gonna be? Help me. Oh! Yes! Oh! Right there, yes! Don't stop. Yes! Oh! Gary! Hey. Why'd you stop, Gary? Where even are we, anyway? You're so strong. Gary. It's Dirk. Where are we going? Put me down, please. Why are we spinning? Almost there. I've never done it on a bench before. Stay here. Go to sleep. Hey! Where are you going?! Get back here! What, you can't handle this? I bet you have a small dick! Pussy! So much for a send off. Where are my boys at? Hey, Ricky, is that you? Hey, jerk-off! Oh, what the fuck?! What do you want?! If you come up here, I'll send you back down! Please no! Oh, no, no! Ooh, girl, pretty good moves for someone who almost didn't show. Just trying to keep up. I'll be back in a minute, okay? Okay hurry back babe. - Hey, you showed. - Oh. You keep sneaking up on me like that. Sorry, it's loud in here. Sorry, uh... I-I didn't mean to... I-When I... When I was telling you earlier that I wasn't coming, I was telling the truth. Um... Oh, no, it's fine. It's just my friend Donna, you know, she put this whole thing together, and I was thinking, you know, I really should come and support her, you know? I'm glad you're here. I know these aren't your thing. Have you been dancing? A little bit, yeah. You up for a little more? Sure. Yeah. Sorry I'm awkward. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Whoa! Hey! I didn't know you could dance like that. Come on. I knew you'd be back. That's right, come and get me. Benji, will you get the door? It's stuffy in here. Ask and you shall receive, babe. That was great. Always is. How am I gonna survive without this every day? How are we going to survive without this every day? We'll figure it out. I know, it's just, there's gonna be a whole new group of girls where you're going and I don't want you to feel unhappy. Unhappy? Why would I be unhappy? You're the best thing that ever happened to me. Benji, when's the last time we even talked on the phone? And if we're busy now, just imagine what college is gonna be like. Do we just become the couple that texts all day? The only reason I don't call you is because I see you every day. With you in Oregon and me in Atlanta, I'm gonna call you every chance I get. But is that enough for you? Why wouldn't it be enough? We'll see each other a few times a year. Thanksgiving, Christmas. Maybe. What are you wearing? Ben, this is serious. I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life. You're the girl for me, Madison, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make this work. Are you with me? Of course, Ben. I love you. Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Let him go! Let him go, let him go! Let him go, let him go! No, no, no! Whoa, you're killing it. Oh, really? What about you? I didn't think I'd have this much fun. Loud parties, fun? Come on. All right, everyone, we're just about wrapped up with the dance portion of the evening. But before we pack up and watch the movie, I have one more slow one for you. You kids, enjoy. So, you wanna... Yes. Holy shit. Son of a bitch did it. Steve. Hey, Steve? Yeah? I'm glad you took the long way home today. Me too. Okay, everyone, we're winding down now. Boys and girls, turn into your respective locker rooms, change into your PJs, and let's get ready for the movie. We'll all meet back here in 10 to 15 minutes. Thank you. You got a date for the movie? Are you free? I think I can pencil you in. Oh. Emma. Yeah? What's up? I told Bobby I'd meet him out on the track for one last lap before he leaves. It's a bro thing. No, no, no, no. I get it. But maybe you could meet me out on the Mulch Mound in like 30 minutes? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Cool. And I have something for you. - You took it? - 30 minutes. Don't get caught. I'm sorry I ran off on you. Are you kidding me? Cozy up to Steve Clayton? I think I'll live. Oh, did it look bad? What do you mean? Like, do you think I'm moving too fast or... No. I mean, you like him, right? - Yeah, yeah, he's sweet. - Oh, you're fine, then. Plus, with Ben and Maddie as the standard, I think you've got some wiggle room. Oh, speaking of, where is Maddie? Have you seen her? No. Who knows where they ran off to? There's another thing, Donna. What's up? He asked me to meet him out on the Mulch Mound - during the movie. - Really?! Wow! So I was wondering if you would cover for me. I just need you to distract Mr. Weebly - just for a minute. - Emma. All right. Oh, I owe you big time. Just give me five minutes. - I'll take care of it. - Okay. Okay. I'll be back before the movie's even half over, okay? Okay. Be safe. - Be smart. - I know. I will. I will. All right, you mamas' boys... Where's Ben? What do I look like, his girlfriend? Don't fucking get smart with me. All right? All you guys, stop screwing around. Get out there, all right? And if you see Ben, you actually tell him I'm looking for him. What a tool. Hey, Jet, what's with the headphones? Got to have music for my run. Get the fuck outta here. You're running, tonight? Gotta get the cardio in somewhere. And I thought Stewart was the freak. Watch it, Johnny. It's just a joke, man. Better be. We're all good here, Jet. Enjoy your run, bro. Shouldn't let punks like that fuck with you. Johnny? Conner? Is that you? Stealing my clothes?! Really?! You know what?! I don't have to put up with this shit anymore! You can't keep doing this to me! Donna, everything's going so swell! Oh, yeah, I think we're doing a great job. Well, actually, I heard from a couple of different people about a problem I think we really need to address. Oh, boy, Donna, what is it? Well, Mr. Weebly, uh, it's the temperature. Oh, the temperature? Great job staying on top of everything, Donna. Of course. It's the least I could do. Hey, Bobby! Where the hell are you?! Did you see it, man?! It actually happened! I mean, she showed up outta nowhere and we danced and... Oh, she's so cool, man. We just connected, you know? There you are. What are you doing all the way out here? Are you drunk already? Oh, I better not hear any excuses when I beat you. Hey, bud, what are you... Oh, god. Bobby? No. Oh, god... Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Aren't you tired of running?! Are you okay? - Bobby, Bobby. - Ow, Steve. Bobby's dead. - Bobby's dead. - Steve. - Bobby's not dead. - I saw him on the track. He had a pole ran through him like a scarecrow. And I saw the bastard who did it. He almost got me too. Why are you doing this?! This isn't a joke! - Come on, let's go! - Steve! Emma, do you trust me? No, please! No. No. No! Come on! No! Hey! What the fuck are you doing, man? Whoa! This isn't funny, asshole! Come on, man, what the hell?! When I get out of this, I'm gonna fucking beat your ass! You may be wondering why I've asked you here. Let me see that hand. What a beautiful hand. I love it! I think I'll take it! Ah, my hand! Emma? Emma? I don't wanna interrupt anything, I just wanna know you're all right. Emma! Emma? Emma? Donna. Donna! Oh, my god, Emma! Emma, what's happened?! Oh, fuck! Are you okay?! No! Donna, you have to go! Get outta here! Go get help! You're bleeding! Listen, listen, there's a man here- - A man? What man? - Who? - The one Ben was talking about at lunch, he's here! I swear, he's here! He locked me in that room, Donna! It was so horrible! You have to go get help! Can you walk? No. Emma, you're gonna be okay. Let's go! Have you seen Steve? He hasn't come back yet. He killed him! He killed him right in front of me! It was all over me! His blood is all over me! I was all alone, Donna! - Emma- - Please! I'm right here, okay? I'm not going anywhere, all right? Emma, look at me. Officer Greg is right over there. We have to go to him. He'll know what to do, okay? And we'll be safe. Okay? Okay. Are you with me? - Yes. - Okay. Go away, you hear me? Not a step closer! - It hurts, Emma! - I know! You're gonna be okay. Donna, wait here. Keep pressure on it. Officer Greg, please! Officer Greg! - Emma. - Please! Emma! He's under here. Can you get up? Come on. I can't! I can't. Doesn't look good, does it, Em? You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay, Donna. I can't move. I can barely talk. That's a first. Some party, huh? Yeah. Do you think everyone had a good time? Yeah. Yeah, the best party ever. And it's all because of you. Donna? Donna? Donna? Donna, no. Donna! Wake up! Wake up! Donna. No. No. No, no, no. Donna. No. You killed her! She was family to me and you killed her like it was nothing! Why are you doing this?! What are you gonna do after you kill me?! You're gonna kill everybody, is that what you want?! No. Everybody, get up! Run! He's coming! Please, get up! Did you hear me?! He's right outside! What'd I do? What happened to you? It's locked! Okay, okay, children, up the stairs, up the stairs! Let's go, let's go! Come on, up the stairs! Let's go, let's go! Girls, girls, girls, girls! Oh, my. Jesus. We gotta do something! We gotta help 'em! If any of you guys try to go through this fucking door, you're gonna have to go through me, got it?! Is that Coach Russo? He's dead? Of course he's dead! We're all gonna be dead! This door's locked! We're screwed! No, we're not! Don't say that! You're all gonna be fine. How do you know that?! Because I wouldn't let anything happen to any one of you. All right, boys and girls, boys and girls, we have to stay quiet and stick together. Okay. Come together. Okay, come together. Guys? What?! I found Stewart! Stewart? What about him? His body's back here! He's dead! Fuck this, man. Everyone! Everyone, hold on! Shit! Hey! Leave them alone! Oh, please! Please open! Please! Please! Ben! Maddie! Donna? Yes? I'm so sorry, Donna. Don't be. You have to keep moving. We'll catch up. They'll come looking for us, Henry. We got to go into hiding! We agreed! We're going to the Keys to find my dad! Ah, what the hell, Henry?! No chance! It's a bullshit story! Your ma told you that so that you wouldn't cry about your daddy walking out on you! You really thought that he walked all the way from- - Liar! Some party, huh? Bobby spiked the punch. It could've killed me. My leg! My leg! My leg! - My leg! - Yes. Yes! Yes! Don't you see me, Mutt? I've got the burning in me now! You're burning now, bastard! Jordy! Jordy! Do you copy? Please, come in, Jordy. I copy. Oh, thank god. Jordy, what I'm hearing, this doesn't make any sense. 19 casualties at the high school? 20. We just found the janitor out back. Perp took his keys and went room to room, hunting them. I don't believe it. This can't be true. Greg, Greg can't be... And those kids? What kind of person would do this? This isn't a person, Barbara. Evil came to Shelby. But now, he's in a body bag. You better wake the coroner. He's got a hell of a day ahead of him. Oh, it's so awful! Greg was a good man, Sheriff. I'm sorry. I'm the one who has to call his family and tell them he's not coming home. Goddammit! I've known that boy since he was a kid. Jesus. Where's the kid who got this animal, anyway? The hospital. She was hysterical. Took three guys to tie her down. Never seen anything like it. Looks like we got our guy, Jordy. But you were right. I'm so sorry. If I'm never right again, Sheriff, I'll die a happy man. A heartbreaking story coming out of Shelby, Florida, is getting national attention as millions learned of the massacre last night at Seacrest High School, leaving 15 students, three members of the faculty, and an on-duty police officer dead during their end of the year lock-in. The man responsible has been confirmed to be the individual known as the Coast to Coast Killer, reopening dozens of cold cases across the country. Even more astonishing is that the rampage was stopped by the heroic efforts of an 18-year-old high school girl, Emma Bradley, when she managed to set the man on fire, using alcoholic punch and a lighter. When reached for comment, her father had this to say... Mr. Bradley, what is your reaction to the incident that occurred last night? Please, I've already answered so many questions, I... Our town is in mourning, and my heart goes out to the families of all of those who've lost their lives. As for my daughter, I'm just glad she's alive. Do you have anything else to say to the millions at home listening right now? You should remind the people who are important to you that you love them. Someday, you could lose that chance. Now, please, our family needs rest. Goodbye. What a terrible tragedy. The world is grieving with you, Shelby. May their memory never be forgotten. Emma?! Sweetheart! We got to get a move on! Okay! Coming! Hey, Dad, guess what. What is it, sweetheart? I finally finished my book. Just now? That's great, honey. I knew you could. Your mom would be so proud. You too, Dad You've come a long way from burning Pop-Tarts. You sure I can't get you to stay one more semester, honey? No. I'm ready. And you're gonna be okay driving this thing up there? Oh, are you kidding? It's great. I love you so much, sweetheart. I love you too, Dad. Please drive careful? I will. They said the age of legends had ended. Maybe. But that's the thing about legends, isn't it? They never truly die.
