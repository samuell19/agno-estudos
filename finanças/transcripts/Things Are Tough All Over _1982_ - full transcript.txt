Goode ♪ Yeah, a lot of people think Elvis was the king of rock 'n' roll, but I say it's Chuck Berry, man. Chuck Berry will always be the king in my book. He even went to jail for rock 'n' roll. I really admire a guy that stands up for what he believes in. I remember one time I learned a Chuck Berry intro to "Johnny B. Goode," man. Took me six months. I had to slow the record down, man. I learned it note for note, man. And then our singer changed keys on us, man. What a bummer! And you gotta respect rock 'n' roll too, man. 'Cause it'll kill you. It killed Elvis, man. A lot of people think it was the drugs, but it wasn't the drugs. What happens, man-- you get into rock 'n' roll, and it's so much fun you take drugs to enjoy it, you know? And then you take so much drugs, you forget what you're taking. And next thing you know, it kills you. And, you know, it's not even the drugs that'll kill you, man. What really kills you is looking for drugs. Keeps you up all night, man. I remember when I was heavy into drugs, I'd be up three days... Lookin' for some toot or somethin', man. I said, "to hell with that, man." I put it down, man. I haven't done any drugs or smoked a joint or nothin' for a whole week, man. And I feel so good, I wanna get high. You know what I mean? Ah, shit, man-- That's my partner. He usually don't have much to say, but that'll show you what 20 cups of coffee will do. Oh, and that's me. I'm really handsome, huh? See, I've heard all this stuff before, man, 'cause we've been driving for three days straight. See, like, we started off in Chicago, you know? And, like, we were there during the coldest day in history, man. It was, like, 80 below, you know? It was, like, even colder if you lived down by the lake. And it was even colder if you were Mexican, you know? And then if you were Mexican and lived down by the lake, it was-- Oh, okay. What I'm trying to say is, like, things were tough all over. And, uh-- but, see, we were lucky, 'cause at least we had a job. Come on. Be a customer, man. Come on in, brother. All right, we got a customer, man. Oh, hey! Ooh! Hey, hey, welcome to mekka car wash, man. Mm-hmm. Say, I want you to be real clean with my machine, you know? And I'm aware of all the tapes I got in my car too. - I ain't got no Freddy Fender. - Hey, get lost! I'm cleaning it up right now. I'm gonna turn the heat up. Oh, god, my toes are like bricks, man. Hey. Look at this car, man. How somebody could take a perfectly good car and righteously mess it up. Look at this dash. If it was mine, I'd do it chartreuse green... With a nice big blue diamond there, man. Baby booties coming off. That'd be heavy. Look, that guy put leopard skin. I'd put tiger skin, man. That's much hipper. Get rid of this shit. Put one of them little chain wheels on, man, then lower the sucker. God, it's cold. Give me a hit. The thing's not lit, man. I can't get my fingers to work. Tobacco! Agh! Wonder if he got any tapes. What did he lock his glove compartment for, man? The punk. Probably just go mambo-jambo music, anyway. Man, you smell something burning? Hey, man, don't you look at those ashtrays before you empty them, man? Look at, that stuff is still burning, man! You're making it worse. The whole cigarette pack's on fire, man! Stamp it out! Stop! The car! We're moving! How do I get out? Lift the handle! It's stuck! - Help! - Come on, unlock us! Oh, no! Hey! Aw, shit. Ahhhhh, god! Hey, we're going in! Watch out! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Ahhh. Hey, stop the car! Hey! Hey! Ahhh, I swallowed this crap. It's burning my throat! Oh, shit! I know, I know. Oh, god, I can't see! No, not the spray wax! No spray wax! No! Oh, no! Oh, please, please! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ohh! Aaah! My car! Get out of my car! Hey, man, did you want spray wax? We didn't keep the car wash job for too long, man. We got fired. Well, actually we didn't get fired. We got another job. See, these arabs that owned this car wash also owned this night club. And they needed a band, so, hey, we put a band together. Man, why not? You know, what we did was we went out and got the heaviest players in town, you know, and we put this heavy monster group together, man. Hey, we were really good too. One, two, three, four. Hey, good evening, everybody. We want to welcome you all to the club mekka. We're glad everybody could make it tonight. It's nice to see all your smiling, friendly faces out here. We want to give you a really good show tonight, man. We're gonna knock your socks off. We wanna take you for a little trip down memory Lane. Just imagine, everybody, you're cruising down whittier boulevard. Everybody remember whittier boulevard? Hey! Whoo! Anybody here from the phantom scar club? How about, anybody here from Garfield high? How about Lincoln? How about verdugo? Any vatos from verdugo high here? Whoo! Get down! All right, so just pretend you're in the back seat of a '53 Chevy, and you got a little bottle with you, a little b&b. Listening in your vibrasonic. Got your arm around your best girl.

You go ahead, man. Oh, come on, man. They're waiting for us. Ah, I don't know. They-they're doing the arabs. Hey, man, they sent us up a request. They want to party with us, man.

Hey, lady, my pants are in the dryer, and i-- oh, shit. To serve and protect. You know, this used to be a good neighborhood. Now they're everywhere. Every place you go. What did this guy look like? They look at you with those sick pervert eyes. What was he dressed like? They stare at you. They practically stare your clothes off. Did he-- you take a bus ride. Maybe a million empty seats. But no, they gotta sit right next to you. You gonna sign a complaint to put this guy away? Rub their sweaty bodies... Right up against you! It's sick, I tell you! The whole world is sick! Tell you what. Why don't you come with me, and we'll fill out a nice police report. Report? There's a weirdo running around in here, and you wanna do a report? What is that supposed to mean? This time I want answers! You gotta do something! Help! Help! Help! Is that stuff dry in there? I got some more dimes if you need 'em. Where you been, man? You missed all the excitement. Some pervert tried to rape a little girl, man. Geez, what a sick neighborhood, huh? Hey, what's wrong with you? Hey, you're stoned, aren't you? I bet you never even saved me any, either. Hey, where is it, man? This is the car wash we used to work at before we got fired. Oh, and this is one of the owners of the car wash. He's a real cool dude... And a real sharp dresser. He just had some real strange customs. Oh, and that's his brother. He was the business man of the two guys. He's the guy that never paid us. How-how do you like? Please. Mirror. I have to see mirror. Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Of course, what we do is take the healthy hair from his back... And put it in a random fashion up here to create a natural hairline. Later on, of course, I'll fill in the top, and it'll move on back all over. Yes, random. That looks very natural. Doesn't it? Yes. How do you like it? They put in random, see? And it looks very, very natural. Yes. Habib, how do you like it? Better than hairpiece. You are right. Much better than "herpes." I should say so! Yes, before I had herpes on my head. You had herpes on your head? Yes, of course. Where else would you have it? On your dick? Ha-ha! I really do wish you'd mentioned that to me before. It was very embarrassing. I mean, everybody could see. You walk into a room, and they say, "ha, he has herpes on his head." You could not do anything. You could not go swimming. Because you have herpes. And girls don't like that. Very hard to get date with herpes. Yeah, this is much better. Tell you what. I give you souvenir. I give you my herpes. No, no, no, no. That's all right. Thank you, though. I insist, I insist. No, really, you keep 'em. A souvenir. Here, you take my herpes. I don't need anymore. Oh, "hairpiece." Yeah, that's much better. What is it? What are you doing? I told you to take it to Vegas. What? You idiot. Get out of here! Go on! Go on, everybody! Out, out, out! Oh, you make me so mad! Get out of here. What do they do? They send it back to us. Oh, that idiot Abdul. I don't believe that stupid idiot. Abdul, what in the hell are you doing? When I send you $5 million, you keep $5 million! Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care. Use your imagination. You are in Las Vegas. You have $5 million. Are you a total idiot? I'm sending the money-- I cannot launder any more money through this car wash. I don't care about your problems. Things are tough every over. I am sending back the money to you. Do you understand? And you keep it this time! Ah, the stupid idiot! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! The stupid thing! It's funny how things work out. The arabs just heard our band one time, and they wanted us to go on the road. So they gave us a job driving this limousine to Las Vegas. Come on! Hey, man, you're gonna run the battery down. I'm not gonna run the battery down. Look, we're out of gas, man, see? Didn't you check it, man? Oh, man! Shit, how can we be out of gas, man? We're not even out of town yet. We gotta find a gas station, man. Maybe that guy knows. Hey, dude! Hey, brother! Yo. Hey, man, come over here. Hey, you know where we can find a gas station? Yeah, yeah, man. Which one? Uh, wash your window. Let me wash your window. No, no, we don't want-- they're not dirty, man. The windows are clean, man. I'll do the windows. Hey, man, don't put that mud on the windows, man! I'll do the windows. Give me a dollar. We just need a gas station. Give me a dollar. We don't got a dollar, man. We need to find a gas station. Come on, give me a dollar. I need a dollar. Oh, shit. Give him a dollar. I ain't got no money. What do you mean? The arabs gave you some money. I spent it. What do you mean you spent it? - I paid off our bar tab. - Oh, man! Hey, man, get out of the car! Hey, come on, man. Get out of the car. Ah, shit. See what you do, man? You don't even check to see if we have gas. Come on, man, get out! Hey, man, open the door. Hey, come on, man! Open this door! I ain't bullshittin' with you. Get out! Oh, shit! Come on, man. Hey, man, unlock the door! Hey, man, unlock the door, man. It's cold out there, man. I know it's cold out here. I'm out here. Go around the other side. Open it from the inside. Man, come on! It's locked. I know it's locked. We gotta get this guy out of there. Open the door. Come on, man. Go around the other side. Oh, shit, man. - Hi, officer. - Can I help you? Oh, no, we're okay, man. We just got this chump in the back seat, man. You got the "champ" in the back seat? Damn, that is the champ! Hey, champ! What'd you tell him, man? I didn't tell him nothing. He told me. This guy thinks he's got the champ in the back seat. Hey, sit still, champ. We got a ride. Hey, brother. Hey, thanks a lot, man. Oh, sure, sure. Anytime, anytime. I appreciate it, man. Hey, listen, could I just meet the champ, just for a second? He don't like strange people coming up to him, all right? I just wanna talk to him. I'm a real big fan. He's real tired, man. All right, well, can I get an autograph? Oh, yeah, sure. Oh, great, great. Here. Just tell him to write anything he wants. Something like, "Willie Albert, my best buddy and sparring partner of all times. Love always, the champ." Yeah, yeah, sure. Great, great, great. All right, there you go. Yeah, thanks a lot. All right. Wait right there. Okay. Hey-- hey, champ, come on, we gotta sign an autograph. Yeah? Who it for? It's for the cop who gave us a ride over here, man. Well, what his name? His name is black Russian or something like that. Just sign "to the black cerote." There you go. Yeah, that's good. You got good handwriting. Hey, thanks a lot, man. There you go, man. Oh, great, great! He's a really big fan of yours, man. He's heard of me? Oh, yeah, yeah! So you think I can spar a little with him? He'll punch your lights out. Great, great, great! Thanks a lot. Yeah, no problem, man. Thanks, champ. See you later, man. Hey, be good, man. Thanks a lot. All right. Yeah, he's got all your albums. Hey, protect the city. All right. Hey, man, you got $24.15 on gas. Oh, yeah. My partner's got the money, man. Hey, give him $24.15. What? $24.15 for the gas, man. I ain't got no money. What do you mean you ain't got no money? I told you, I ain't got no money. What'd you do with it? I paid our bar tab, man. So we don't got no money? Nothing. Not one cent? Nothing. Not a penny. What'd you buy that candy bar with? What candy bar? That candy bar that you got all in your beard there, man. Oh, well, that's a quarter, you know. Oh, man! Hey! Hey, where you going with that, man? That ain't ours, man. Yeah, I know it's not yours, man. It's mine. Now, when you get your money, it'll be right here.
