(music) Barbara Smith Conrad: Every morning when I wake up, before I get out of bed, I have a little prayer and it starts with: "Guide my feet, Lord, while I run this race. Hold my hand, Lord, while I run this race." That's a spiritual. ♪ That starts my day every day. Because there are some days I just don't know what I'm in for. Or I don't want to face it. No one had ever said to me up close that you're not good enough before. ♪ I felt so betrayed by people I so trusted. ♪ I just did what I always do. Just keep singing.

Rolling hills, red clay dirt, honeysuckle everywhere, pine trees everywhere, oak trees everywhere, and it is just sheer beauty. This community was founded by five freedmen, and one of them was my great-grandfather. I know Center Point is going to sound like Shangri-La, and for some of us, it was. (singing) We sang all of the time, in prayer meetings and revival meetings. It was a place where I could express everything I felt, and no one could judge me there. (singing) Music was the center of my universe... (singing) and the singing, the music, was key. (singing) (applause) Barbara Fluellen: Music is the key. It's something, you know, that we take we take a great deal of pride in. Because that's the way that we express ourselves. (singing) Barbara Conrad: My whole family was musical. My sister had a great voice. My mother, my grandmother. My brother, Dinard, was a child prodigy. He could play anything on the piano. (music) Because of him, I grew up learning the most complicated music, not realizing it. I learned hard music. I didn't know it was hard. Bach, Mozart, Stravinsky. When I was a teenager, mama, whenever possible, would take me to live concerts, and the one she took me to first was Marian Anderson. ( Marian Anderson singing) I was just so in awe, seeing your own kind up on a stage. It was like opening a new world. She did it. Maybe I can too. Barbara Fluellen: Center Point built in us something that said to me, "You are a significant person. "You are somebody of value. We expect great things from you." You always knew that there was a support system. Barbara Conrad: We were always safe in that environment because we had each other. But then you go outside that little cocoon, and it was not easy. Because those boundaries had been set for us so long ago. The man that I had a crush on when I was 12, I saw them drag his body out of a lake because he had made a pass at some white lady. I don't know if that was true or false, but I know he was killed. I wept for him for years. Those were the things that used to absolutely take me from rage to sadness. And I went directly to my Big Mama's house. She had this rocking chair with a stool next to it, and every time you had a problem, she'd make you sit on that stool, and she'd read from the Bible. "Come, let us reason together." A 13 year old child is not interested. I just wanted to rant and rave. She said, "You don't know it yet, child, but you have a built in motivation for living." And she said, "Well, now, you know, what can we do with this?" I was clearly enamored with singing. It had been a dream, a passing fantasy sort of thing. I really didn't understand what it was to be a professional musician. I knew about music making. I had a lot of catching up to do. If I were going to have a really good education, there were few options. And none of them were anywhere near Center Point. Going away to college was the highest possible goal. Education was the way out, or the way in as the case may be, you know. So here was my opportunity. I remember getting on the train, going to Austin, thinking, I don't really know where I'm going or what to expect. The University of Texas had a fine music school. I didn't know anyone at the University of Texas, but I knew I was from Center Point, and from Jerrie Lee and from Conrad Smith, and whatever I had to do I could do it. Thurgood Marshall: The Negro school children must be given their rights. Given them, to use the court's language, "As soon as practicable, and on a non-discriminatory basis." Desegregation will proceed to open the door to true democracy for all of the children of our nation. Barbara Conrad: I was dreaming the same dreams that everyone else was dreaming in that period. That we really will overcome. That we really will be brothers and sisters. I thought that was a great ambition. You knew what you were fighting for. The right to higher education. The right for equal education. Ken Ashworth: The University of Texas decided in fall of 1956, the admissions requirements at the undergraduate level would be open to all races, opening the opportunity for African-Americans to attend the University of Texas at the undergraduate level, since a few were already studying here in professional graduate school and law school. Announcement: This institution of learning belongs to you. Your legislature has created it. Your support has improved it. Your growth has deserved it. This is your university. Ken Ashworth: Austin was more receptive to desegregation than the rest of the state. ♪ Oh there ain't gonna be no runoff ♪ ♪ No runoff anymore ♪ ♪ We didn't like the runoff When O'Daniel ran before ♪ ♪ Oh there ain't gonna be no runoff ♪ ♪ No runoff anymore ♪ ♪ We didn't like the runoff When O'Daniel ran before ♪ Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel: Here's my pledge to the people of Texas, that as soon as I become governor, and as long as I remain governor, we are going to continue to have segregation in Texas, just exactly like we've always had it. Ken Ashworth: People drew on whatever arguments they could find to support trying to keep those who were down in their proper place. Price Daniel: Here's a front-page story, picture, on the CIO news. We see a picture of Walter Reuther handing a $75,000 check to the president of the NAACP. What for? In order to help finance law suits in the southern states against those school districts which have not chosen to do away with their separate but equal schools. Ken Ashworth: People here in Austin often learned that it was better to remain quiet. ♪ Barbara Conrad: There were no accommodations for blacks, men or women, on that campus at that time. We didn't live on campus. We were not able to go to any restaurant, on or off campus, unless it were owned by blacks. It was pretty much segregated. Harley Clark: The administration, I don't think they did very much to make everyday life for the new students more comfortable. It dawned on us, being students like me in leadership positions, that we had black students on the campus that, if you were a man, hell, you couldn't get a haircut. Peggy Drake Holland: I lived in Almetris Co-op, and my first roommate was Barbara Smith Conrad. There were 25 of us from various parts of Texas that lived there. It was not a welcoming climate. There were some people who smiled at you if you walked down the street or something, but overall it was a very tough place. Barbara Conrad: And the first day in orientation, we gathered in front of the great tower. Even now my heart goes t-t-t-t just a little bit. It was exciting. It was terrifying. There were... some jeering. And some boy screamed out, "Oh, look at them. "Our pappies probably messed around with all their grand mammies." Peggy Drake Holland: When I went into my classrooms, I had the chance of sitting anywhere I wanted, because if I were the first one in there, no one sat near me. If I came in late and there was an empty chair and people were sitting around, they got up and left and sat elsewhere. There were occasions when people just yelled out of their cars. Sometimes it was just hurtful that people would look at you, and just because of the color you were, just treat you in a certain way. Barbara Conrad: When I would go to the music school, I felt very much at home and accepted. I was treated well. We were just students learning music together. Learning how to perform it. Learning about staging. Learning about developing characters. Carolyn Graves Good: The music school was full of interesting people from different places, and the teachers were challenging. Barbara Conrad: I had asked for someone to help me tutor in subjects that I just couldn't catch up with, and that's when I met Carolyn Graves Good. Carolyn Graves Good: When Barbara came to the music school, what I remember is that there was this tall striking black student that sang so beautifully. She had the most amazing voice I had ever heard. That's what drew me to her was her talent. Barbara Conrad: She was bossy. She still is. She still bosses me around. She was a great friend to me. She was the first person who took me by the hand and included me in every possible activity. Carolyn Graves Good: She was a little shy. She wasn't, her diva self that she is today. She didn't seem country in any way. She had her own sophistication about her. We just became good friends. Music was a part of that. I think music began that. Ken Ashworth: Every year, the College of Fine Arts would put on an opera. And this particular year, 1956, they decided to put on Purcell's Dido and Aeneas . Barbara Conrad: And a woman by the name of Josephine Antoine, who'd been a wonderful Metropolitan Opera soprano, was on faculty there, and heard me in a practice room, barged in and said, "My dear, you're our next Dido." And of course I didn't have a clue who that was. Ken Ashworth: When the tryouts came for the role of Dido, Barbara was a natural. Barbara Conrad: She asked me to come and audition, and I did the next day. I sang The Lord's Prayer, and the following day, went to a big music, sort of general music class, and everybody stood up and started applauding, and I was thinking they were jeering. And "No, no," the teacher said. "You've been selected to do Dido." That's how I got the role. (Music From Dido and Aeneas) Ken Ashworth: The interesting thing about Dido and Aeneas, it's represented as a romance. Aeneas was the male who had been shipwrecked on this island. Dido was the queen. They fell in love. Some witches represented the evil spirits, and they came and warned him that he needed to leave, and so he leaves Dido, and then she stabs herself and dies. It's not a very romantic plot. Carolyn Graves Good: I was in the chorus. I had never been in an opera before, and I thought it was just great. Barbara Conrad: I had no idea who the queen of Carthage was. It was an opportunity to sing my very first opera. Can you imagine? I was absolutely convinced I was going to win the Academy Awards with this. Dwonna Goldstone: No one thought about the fact that a black woman would be playing the romantic opposite of a white man. Ken Ashworth: Most parts of the country were still steering away from the idea of showing any kind of love relationship between the races, and here was the University of Texas, in the very first year that it had integrated undergraduates, casting them in a love relationship. Barbara Conrad: We began rehearsals little by little. One of the famous arias from that is "When I Am Laid in Earth." That is the aria that really captured me. ("When I Am Laid In Earth" From Dido and Aeneas) The melody will make you cry. You don't have to know anything about it. I felt really, really blessed. I started getting phone calls. They had been happening once in a while. Just nothing that really made me that nervous. And then it became a little bit more ominous, because they would talk about places I had sung. After one rehearsal, for example, there were three or four big burly guys who were, I guess the purpose was to frighten me. And they did that very well. It got more ominous as time went on. Like the day I walked across campus, and a man just came up with a mouth full of spittle and just -sp- right in my face. And said, "You're the Negra girl - you're that Barbara Smith." And he disappeared. I had no idea who he was, or what made him feel like he had the right to do that. Carolyn Graves Good: I had been getting death threats because I was her friend. And the White Citizens Council was trying to say, "Wake up." I didn't realize there was such a thing as a White Citizen's Council. I knew about the Klan in the south. Horace Sherman Miller: We are not negative. We're positive. We are for, a better civilization, a better United States, a better Texas. Barbara Conrad: All of those organizations that were concerned with integration had their eye on places like UT Austin. Harley Clark: There were men in the Legislature, the Texas Legislature, who were adamantly segregationists. Ken Ashworth: The Legislature in those days was dominated by rural Legislators. Segregationists, who were representing their constituents. They personally were opposed to integration as well. Harley Clark: That's all they talked about, you understand? I mean this was their life. I mean, they were eaten up with fear. They had no discernment, and that partly is what made them dangerous. Carolyn Graves Good: Joe Chapman certainly made clear his views. He didn't want the University integrated. He didn't want any money to go to UT if integration happened. Barbara Conrad: It was my very own representative from northeast Texas, Joe Chapman, who informed everybody that there's a Negra girl playing opposite a blonde, blue-eyed boy. Joe Chapman: The University students called to the attention of several members of the Legislature, including myself, the fact that the music department of the University had auditioned and was casting an opera. A Negra girl attending the University, as I understand it, for the first time, was being considered for the leading role. The girl involved in this matter is a perfect, perfect example of the excellent schools that Texas provides for Negras. And the fact that she does have a good voice, and has been trained for two years in a Texas Negra school proves this excellent training. I do not feel that out of a student body of 17 thousand, a minority of 50 should impose upon the majority, and force them to assume a role that is not traditionally socially acceptable to the people of Texas. Ken Ashworth: At some point, Representative Chapman called President Logan Wilson. Logan Wilson had many things to consider. One of them is that it was almost a totally state supported institution. Getting the State Legislature angry with the University, upset with the procedures, what the University was doing, was always a basis of leverage with the Legislature to try to get the University to do what they wanted with the threat of cutting funds. President Wilson called a staff meeting, and brought in Dean Doty and some other advisors. Dwonna Goldstone: On the one hand people thought, "Oh, they won't ever pull the University's appropriations for this." But on the other hand, it was a very real threat. Barbara Conrad: I was called into Dean Doty's office. Dean of the College of Fine Arts. And he had the unfortunate task of telling me that I had to be removed from the cast because of concerns about my well-being. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't have died if I hadn't sung Dido in Dido and Aeneas . But I felt so betrayed. Dean Doty meant a lot to me. He was one of my favorite teachers. I turned to him for a lot of things. And he had to sort of cloak the real reasons, and for me it was just a lie. And that hurt more than anything. Harley Clark: Logan Wilson was not a mean man. But he just thought that he was probably doing what he needed to do. I had been elected President of the University of Texas student body. I went up to the main building where Logan Wilson had his office. Logan Wilson - he was a heavy smoker, and he talked out of the left side of his mouth, you know, sort of growling like this. And so the reason I went up to see him was I wanted to make a case out for Barbara. And I got about halfway through "my little rehearsed in my mind" before I got there talk, and he put his hand up and said, "Listen, I've talked to many, many people who are "older and wiser than you. "And I've made my mind up now. "I'm a sociologist. I think I know what's best in this situation." Barbara Conrad: I never met the President of the University of Texas when I was a student. Never met him. And that was one of the things that bothered me. How can he make such a decision, and he'd never even talked to me? How did I feel? Well, I didn't matter. Pretty soon the word got around. And someone informed someone at the Houston Post what had happened, and that was it. The story broke. Dwonna Goldstone: And it became national news. And the New York Times picked it up. Time Magazine picked it up. The black newspapers applauded her for the way she responded, because she felt like, if it was in the best interest of the University, then she would withdraw from the opera and not cause a big deal. Carolyn Graves Good: It was clear that this was a media story. We knew outside the Music School, everywhere were cameras. So the question was, how could you duck the cameras? And how could you get around that? Barbara Conrad: I can't go anyplace without meeting reporters. There was someone outside my classroom. In my dorm. We were forever plotting and planning how to hide me, how to get people off my trail. Carolyn Graves Good: It was a full week that the cameras were around. Until they finally got the feeling, I guess, that they really weren't going to get anything. But it seemed like forever. Barbara Conrad: I felt so trapped. I wanted to just say everything that came into my mind. But I was trying to be that person who was a healer. That was part of the upbringing. You tried to make peace and not war. Carolyn Graves Good: Dean Doty called me into his office. And I thought, "Oh dear, what have I done?" He said, "You realize that she's in some danger." And I said, "Yes, I understand that." And he said, "I would like you to get her out of town." Barbara Conrad: Some professors were really scared that it could turn violent, because we were always being threatened about being raped, and all kinds of horrible things. Carolyn Graves Good: One of the first things I thought was, "Am I the only one that's protecting her? "Isn't their somebody in the school or somebody, some adult, that could do this job?" Then she called her mother, and her mother said, "If you need protection, you come home." Barbara Conrad: My housemother and I were on our way out the door to take me to, bring me home where I could get some rest. The rest is history. Harry Belafonte: I saw this story about a young black woman in Texas. That she could not sing was a heartbreak. And it was because of race. And I was quite aware of the fact that calling her might put her life in a huge imbalance. So I wanted to approach the subject somewhat delicately. Barbara Conrad: The phone rang, and the dormitory went wild. "Harry Belafonte's on the phone!" Harry Belafonte: She, at first, couldn't quite believe it. But I finally convinced her that it was me. And I'd read what had happened to her. Barbara Conrad: Everybody at the dorm, white, black or otherwise, had a poster of Belafonte. Because he was so gorgeous. ♪ I wonder why nobody don't like me ♪ ♪ Or is it the fact that I'm ugly? ♪ Barbara Conrad: He was hugely popular. He had a new sound. He was a pop calypso singer. He was very engaged in human rights. Harry Belafonte: I tenaciously decided that I'd just engage in battle. I'd be constantly before the public with the information that all's not well in America. The person who holds in his hands the power to fulfill the American dream, to fulfill the words of the Declaration of Independence, happens to be a person who is white. 1st Roundtable Speaker: It's in the social fabric, you know. 2nd Roundtable Speaker: It isn't anything - it's everything. 1st Roundtable Speaker: It's everything, and I really think... Harry Belafonte: My extension to her was quite simple. If you want, pick any place in the world where you can advance your studies in music. Anywhere. And let's turn your experience into a triumph. Barbara Conrad: I wanted to talk to my parents about what to do, and this option from Mr. Belafonte. My father simply said, "All you have to do is remember what your name is. "Who are you? And if you need to go, go." Basically. "And if you need to stay and fight for your "rights to be here, stay. I'll support you." That's all I needed. The reason for going to University of Texas, Austin, was I was gonna get a better education. So this was a dream, and I was not about to have that dream destroyed. So I stayed. Can't run me out of my home state. Didn't like the feel of that. Harry Belafonte: I think it is absolutely critical that not only that she did that, but that be the course we all take. It is absolutely the right thing to have done, and the critical thing to have done, and I respect her for it. Carolyn Graves Good: Things just settled down. Barbara, I don't remember how long she stayed home for protection for a little bit, but we went back to class, and final exams and all that. Barbara Conrad: You want to graduate, you want to make decent grades, you want a job. I went back to being a student and I was always looking over my shoulder. Belafonte called. This time, I was very pleased to hear from him. Asked if I wanted to come to New York to meet him. Oh, my God, what a day that was. I was so nervous! I don't think I've been more nervous about anything. Everybody had given me something to wear. My mother her watch, her best coat for the winter, which was not nearly warm enough. And I went to his office to meet him that morning. Finally Mr. Belafonte arrives, and he hugged me, and he said, "It's our Texas nightingale!" And then he went, "And she smells like ivory soap!" (laughs) That just broke the ice. It was magical. Harry Belafonte: I was struck by her stature. She was quite elegant and quite stately, very much the diva type. But I also saw the hayseed. She came to New York and she had a - you talk about looking at tall buildings and around the city and what not, and she always seemed to be in a perpetual state of hyperventilating or catching her breath. I guess it was kind of overwhelming in a way, to be in this part of America. Barbara Conrad: New York was a little overwhelming for this, this country girl. No matter how it changes, something about it is just New York. The energy here is unbelievable. I met Poitier that day. I met Sammy Davis, Jr. that day. He took me to theater and great restaurants. What a time. He got these people together, and they listened to me and determined that I had something. We went downstairs when it was over, and I just remember the hug he gave me, and he said, "Hot dang, Barbara, we made it." What was I going to study, how was I going to accomplish these things? Harry very much believed in the complete person behind the artist. He said, "I want to see you able to move gracefully on stage." So I studied dance, jazz and tap and ballet. I went to the Berlitz school of languages. I was all over New York City studying. It was a very exciting time. Carolyn Graves Good: When she went to New York, she was given wonderful training, wonderful teachers, dance instruction, vocal teachers, all of that. But what was missing was food. She really was struggling. When she would perform in New York, we would often go and hear her. We were there at one point, and she had been in a dance class and had fainted. So we sent her care packages from Boston, and we would send her food. She will tell you, I think, that that sustained her, and which we found very amazing, because none of us had any money, and we would send her what we could. The care packages got her through. Barbara Conrad: I wasn't eating very much, and one day Harry invited me to lunch, and I ate a lot, and he said, "How can you be that skinny and eat that much food?" It was a reveal that I basically ate a meal a day. And that's when, really, things changed. ♪ Then you see that fork of lightnin' ♪ ♪ Fare thee well, fare thee well ♪ ♪ And you hear that rumbling... ♪ Harry Belafonte: I got her engaged in doing some background singing and some recordings so she could have additional income to help her with her financial burdens. ♪ fare thee well, fare thee well ♪ ♪ Then you see dem sinners rising, ♪ ♪ fare thee well, fare thee well ♪ ♪ See 'em marching home to heaven ♪ Out of that came Barbara Conrad. ♪ Fare ye well, poor sinners, ♪ ♪ fare thee well, fare thee well... ♪ Barbara Conrad: At a certain point I wanted an independence. I appreciated everything Harry was doing, but I didn't want to be dependent on him. So I did whatever job I could find as time went along. So I taught in the South Bronx for an entire year. They had terrible riots that summer, and there were kids and people of all kinds lined up on these buildings, with all kinds of stuff, throwing it at people. It was an ugly time. It looked like a war zone. It was clearly a time when the imbalances in our system were showing up in a very negative way. Bess Prui I was teaching when I met Barbara. I was working at Alexander Berger Junior High School, and she was in the music department, and I heard her sing. ♪ My Lord,... ♪ ♪ what a morning... ♪ Bess Prui She was gorgeous, and she was talented, and I said, "Mmm! "You have a beautiful voice. "What are you doing? "You should be on the stage. "You shouldn't be in the classroom. You know, you should be performing." You have to keep your talent sharp. And then your talent has to be exposed. And to get it exposed, you need help. I became Barbara's personal representative. Barbara Conrad: Bess is a person who gets things done. She just delved right into it. Didn't know a whole lot about it, but went right into it. Bess Prui The first time I sent out Barbara's promotional brochure, I sent it to a lot of oriatorial groups. And the people from the Dessoff Choirs picked up on her. I looked out from behind the curtain. I could see all of the black sopranos who thought Barbara was their competition. And they were all there listening. And I said, "Barbara, you are on your way." And we were off and running from there. I was relentless. And everything I was doing was working. And, of course, everybody compared Barbara to Marian Anderson. And I began to study how Marian Anderson did it. From the moment she stepped out of the wings, she was in charge. ♪ Ave Maria ♪ I got Barbara to notice all these things. Like, when you're singing, where do you stand? All of that we looked at. Barbara Conrad: I got a reputation for being agile on stage, and a quick learner. And I knew that, for me to be able to be in that league, there are things I had to know. I had to be a strong musician. I needed to know the languages. I needed to know what to do with, with certain texts. My reality was unless I learned how to compete, I wasn't going to get the jobs. There were lots of us out there. Bess Prui When you would go out with Barbara, if we went to a French restaurant, she was speaking French. If we went to an Italian restaurant, she would speak Italian. That has to do with her personal discipline. And she attracted the attention of composers who were interested in her inner drive. ♪ Certainly Lord Have you got feeling... ♪ ♪ Certainly Lord... ♪ I introduced Barbara to Hall Johnson, who was the world's best known authority on music in the Negro idiom. The spiritual in its true form. He learned the spirituals at his grandmother's knee when he was a kid. Barbara Conrad: Bessie introduced me to him because she felt that if I were going to do this, I should meet a great master. I sang "City Called Heaven." It was one of my favorite spirituals, and when I finished, he said, "Well, child, that was very interesting, but that ain't what I wrote." I was so embarrassed! I was speechless for once. ♪ Oh no harm... ♪ The first spiritual I worked on with him was "Ain't Got Time to Die." Maybe we got through a couple of pages. Maybe. And that's like two hours later. ♪ No harm, no harm ♪ Bess Prui That man, he kept you going over one measure of music for an hour, 'til you got it right. David Gilbert: One would not expect that her great knowledge of the spiritual would connect with her singing roles in opera. Her knowledge of the spiritual is such a deeply emotional thing that she brings all of that emotional power to her roles in opera. So it really works. For a singer to have a major opera career, it is of course important to meet conductors, especially highly established and very famous conductors if possible. Because if they hear the voice and they like the voice, then they are the ones who can open many doors. Julius Rudel: I was, for a long time, director of the New York City Opera. I escaped from the horrors of the Nazi regime in Germany, and I escaped because of discrimination. I've made music all my life, and I like it that way. I met Barbara in the early sixties when she auditioned for Bess. We were going to do a new production of Porgy and Bess , by Gershwin. Barbara Conrad: I was recommended to Maestro Rudel to step in to do Porgy and Bess , and I went down, auditioned for him, it was love at first tone, or sight, or something, I'm not sure which, and when I left, I had a job. ♪ I ain't say nuttin', no matter how drunk ♪ ♪ you get dese boys roun' here on rotgut whiskey ♪ Julius Rudel: You need a really stunning looking and sounding woman for the part of Bess. And Barbara was that. Barbara Conrad: I didn't get a crush on Julius. I was in awe of him, I think. I had one real, real rule: number one, you don't date your conductor, and you definitely don't date him if he's married. ♪ Guten Abend, mein Schatz, guten Abend... ♪ Rosalyn Story: For many performers, once they get discovered as a great opera singer in Porgy and Bess , they want to go on to other things. They want to do European Opera. African-Americans had a difficult time getting into opera. You had to transcend all the competition, you know, like you're on a track, you have to lap them a couple of times to be considered someone for whom all the barriers are just broken down. Marian Anderson was much more than just an opera singer. She was the one who inspired many generations of African-American artists. She had a talent that transcended race. History has proven that she had the ability, even though she wasn't trying to, to actually begin a whole movement for change in the arts. Barbara Conrad: It was during the reign of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. I say reign because she was definitely right in the middle of that. ♪ My country, 'tis of thee... ♪ She had been denied the right to sing at Constitution Hall, so Mrs. Roosevelt set it up for her to sing in front of the Lincoln Memorial. And that was a phenomenon. Thousands and thousands of people came. Then fast forward those years later. Tito Capobianco recommended me for this film, a reenacting Marian Anderson in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Can you imagine what that was like? I still am in awe about it. Standing at the top of the Lincoln Memorial, the director asked me to just walk down the steps, and I thought, "Where can I find inspiration for this? "Someone who has been denied a right to sing in Constitution Hall." Boom! Up comes University of Texas. ♪ My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty ♪ I had no idea that was even still in there. You know, you just bring, you just pull down the curtain at a certain point and go on with your life. David Gilbert: The fact that she sang Carmen with Maestro Rudel is a big landmark itself. Carmen is one of the absolutely major roles for a mezzo soprano. Julius Rudel: It's a difficult role, it's a long role. And it requires really a first-rate performer. ♪ Carmen! ♪ ♪ Sur tes pas nous nous tous! ♪ Barbara Conrad: It was license to be as much of a hussy, as beautiful, as sexy - I mean, I had great legs, kid. I showed them off! Quand je vous aimerai? That's got to come from something you experienced somewhere along the way. There's a dark side of her. She was capable to make anything work for her. She did what she needed to do to survive. Bess Prui Barbara began really to bloom after that. She performed in every major opera house. She went to Caracas, Venezuela. She was in the Hamburg Opera. She went to Belgium. She went to Paris. Barbara Conrad: It was very exciting to be an American in Europe then. I was making a new family. What a difference it made to be in an atmosphere where you never once thought about race. It was just being with people who liked what you liked.

(Barbara Conrad sings) (Barbara Conrad sings) (Barbara Conrad sings) (Barbara Conrad sings) Harry Belafonte: Her life just began to take off. And as she was developing and working on her art and her instrument, once in a while I'd get a letter out of the blue from somewhere in the world where she was, just telling me how well she was doing. It was a pleasant journey for me, and I would be pleased that the encounter and the experience with her should have been so positive. Barbara Conrad: Harry Belafonte is totally responsible for the fact that I am sitting here talking to you in an apartment in New York City today. So much of what I am able to pass on is because of his vision. I respected him so much. He was the last person in the world I would want, next to my mom and my daddy, to disappoint. And that just carried through the rest of my life. Bess Prui The thing that was lurking always in her background, you know, was her experience at the University of Texas. I felt that that was a key to a door for her. Barbara Conrad: I had no contact with the University from '59 to '84. Julius Rudel: Barbara never mentioned the horrendous experience that she'd had as a youngster. I was really quite floored when I heard about it much later. Bess Prui She was busy focusing on her career, and that was just a dark shadow in the background. Barbara Conrad: It was like a part of your family that rejected you, and you, in turn, rejected them. I didn't think about University of Texas until something happened. Bess Prui They said that she had been selected as a Distinguished Alumnus. Barbara Conrad: My first response was, "Why would I want to go back?" Bess Prui That was not an opportunity that you would say no to. Barbara Conrad: I would have never dreamed that I would come back to University of Texas. Ever. Do you know what a miracle that is? It's definitely a miracle. Bess Prui I feel like the University of Texas was correcting a wrong and making it right for Barbara. Barbara Conrad: Things changed, but it was not completely resolved. It was still only a symbol. Was I proud? Clearly, it was very meaningful to me. Something was - the door opened. ♪ Jauchzend grüsst das junge Paar Vereint ... ♪ ♪ sind Liebe ♪ Okay. We're gonna stop there. Bravi tutti!

No leaning over! ♪ ♪ Barbara Conrad: I didn't feel I knew enough. I had no interest in reading these letters at the time. "I read in the St. Louis Globe paper about you being dropped "from the cast of a student opera at the request of "Texas Legislator Joe Chapman. I feel sorry for him, and I'm sure God does, too." "Modesto, California, May 13, 1957." This is a letter to Logan Wilson. "If the newspaper reports are true, you are nothing but a "contemptible craven, and unfit to be janitor of the poorest "one-room school in the most backward and degenerate county in Texas, much less a university president." "Dear Sir, Thanks for removing the Negro girl from the "cast of Dido and Aeneas . "That is what I call fighting for the white folks. Let's wake up these sleepy Texans before it is too late." "Dear Dr. Wilson, I am strictly opposed to any play "that has in it actors of two different races. "I think that such will promote intermarriage, and believe that such marriages will result in regrets and unhappiness." "Dear Miss Smith, let me suggest that the inspiring performance "which you have given in the real life role of Barbara Smith "leaves the make-believe role of Dido looking pretty unimportant. "I believe we are going to have a truly great university, "and when that day arrives, you should have a good, "warm feeling from the realization that you contributed magnificently to hasten its arrival." Harry Belafonte: Dr. King showed me the power of redemption. The power of conversion. The capacity to forgive and to move on. Much of that had to do with the soul and the spirit. What is going to be the course of your life? Barbara Conrad: What is happening now is what is the final resolution for me. One of my most favorite things to sing is The Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi. "Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. "Where there is hatred, let me so love. "Where there is injury, pardon. "Where there is doubt, faith. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned." ♪ ♪ ♪ Bryan Hughes: This ordeal that Ms. Barbara experienced way back in the 1950s, really began here in the Legislature. It was her state representative from east Texas who first objected to her performing in the opera, and set all of these things in motion. So it's only right that today, her state representative from east Texas, now me, is the one that gets to have a hand in this and try to make it right. Madame Speaker: Members, may we have some order? Thank you. Bryan Hughes: I don't have to tell you folks that the things we do here are important, and it's always a big deal. But today is a really big day. Ms. Barbara Conrad, she experienced things that most of us can't really imagine, but rather than making her bitter, you can just look at her countenance and see how she trusts God, how she works hard, how she uses her gifts. We're so honored to have her here. Madame Speaker, I move adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 31. Girl: "Now therefore, be it resolved that the eighty-first "Legislature of the State of Texas, hereby commend "Barbara Smith Conrad on her accomplished musical career "and her role in the movement towards civil rights in the United States of America." (cheer and applause) Ken Ashworth: We need to remember, she was a mere 19, 20 years old at that time. I would say she reacted with more poise, sophistication, and aplomb, than practically any of the other actors in this situation. I think that's the most remarkable thing, Barbara Smith's courage. Barbara Conrad: Give me a moment. I am proud to be a Texan. I always was. Which is why you couldn't take it away from me in the first place. It was always my home. Some of the people at the time didn't know I was basically harmless, basically. What I'm most proud of, is of those of you who fought the fight continue to do so for all human rights. For all human rights. You know, for me, it was monumental because I was young. But I knew that this was my, this was my course.
