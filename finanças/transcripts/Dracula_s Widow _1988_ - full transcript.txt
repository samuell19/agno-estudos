[bright orchestral music] [intense music] [lightning striking] [neon lights buzzing] [eerie music] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [neon lights buzzing] - [Hap] Hollywood. Tinsel Town, they call it. Smoke and lights and plenty of noise. A concept with a zip code that takes up space on a map of L.A. But that doesn't make it real. Me? I know where all the bodies are buried. I've been a cop here too long not to. I've seen what this town can offer, hopes and dreams and the nightmares. The kind that come to life. [bottle shattering] Like the one that started at that oddball museum, The Hollywood House of Wax. [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] The exhibits inside were something. Real spooky. Like the owner. A kid named Raymond Everett. - Oh. [sighs] Incredible. - Hey, where do you want this one? - Put it in the back. - Take it. - Carefully, please. There are very valuable things in there. - Hey. Hey, what's all this stuff? Look at this. [laughs] - Please, put that down. This sword is at least 550 years old. It comes from the area that Count Dracula was believed to have lived, Poenari, Romania. Hmm. [sword scrapes] I wonder how many heads rolled at the end of it. [sword scrapes] [Raymond chuckles] - Yeah, that's real interesting. Here, uh, sign here. - Wait, this is odd. It says five crates. I count six. - Oh, so you got an extra one. Well, what do you want us to do? Take it back or something? - No, no, no. - All right. - It's fine. - Yeah. Uh, initial there. [paper tears] Thank you. Goodbye. [mover scoffs] [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] [switch clicks] [footsteps tapping] [crate creaking and clattering] [lid bangs] [crate clattering] [lightning striking] [suspenseful music] [switch clicking] Damn these old fuses. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] [lightning striking] Great. Another break in. [doors close] [slow jazz music] [traffic whirring] [customers chattering] - Hey, Lou. Give us another. - Uh, scotch and soda? - Yeah, stiff. [customers chattering] [ice clinking] [pool balls clacking] Hey Lou, take a look at this babe. Dynamite. Looking for someone? - Yes. - Well maybe I'm that certain someone. [match strikes] All right? How about a drink, baby? - Yes. But not here. - All right. How about little drive somewhere? You know, moonlight, a little romance under the stars, hmm? - Yes. - Good. [crickets chirping] [man moaning] [suspenseful music] Oh, I like that. [dog barking] Feels good, doesn't it? I know you like that. I know. I know you want me. What have we got here? Silk. Mm. I like that. Wait till you see what I'm gonna show you. Uh! Hey, hey, if you like to be on top... [Vanessa snarling] Oh shit! Oh God, get away from me! [thunder rumbling] [film projector clattering] [man whistling] - Looks clear enough for me. Go. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] I think that guy that works here is still upstairs. Be quiet. - Okay, right. [bag rustling] - Shh, shh. Quiet. - This junk is supposed to be worth something? - Yeah. [thunder rumbling] Yeah. Poenari, Romania. That means it's antiques. Yeah. Some old antique dealer's gonna pay a lot of money for this. - Tell you what, Winston, I'm gonna hit the cash register. Just in case the antique dealer doesn't like the goods. - Hey, hey, hey. Be quiet. - I'll walk on my tippy-toes. [crates banging] Shh. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] - Oh, too freaky. Huh. [man chuckles] [Dave chuckles] What you looking at, Jack? Hmm? [lighter clicks] [man laughing] [thunder rumbling] [smoke hissing] [intense music] [Vanessa growling] [claws scraping] [Dave screaming] [wax dripping] Dave? What's going on? Winston? Dave? Would you quit messing around? [Vanessa slurping] Jesus. God. [flashlight clacks] [film projector clattering] [thunder rumbling] [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] [projector fluttering] [Raymond gasping] - Who are you? How did you get in here? [blood dripping] [phone clacks] - Put that down. [rotary dial clicking] Put that down! [thunder rumbling] She's very angelic. Who is she? - My girlfriend Jenny. [glass shattering] - From now on you're only mine! Do you understand? I'm going to make you mine. So you do anything I desire. [Raymond gasps] - Just stay away from me. [suspenseful music] Oh. [Vanessa hissing] [Vanessa slurping] [lightning striking] [suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [thunder rumbling] [phone ringing] - A night rain had washed the garbage from the streets, but something was wrong. I could feel it. I had my own problems. Deputy Police Chief who was bucking for his boss's job and looking to me for help. [receiver clacks] Fat chance. Guy should have been selling pencils. He was a bad cop. [knock on door] - Hey, Hap, why do you keep hanging up on me? - Sorry, Citrano. Barracuda upstairs. - Oh, Christ. They still on your case? [lighter clicking] - What's up? - Couple of rookies just found a body in the park. Apparently, it's real hamburger meat. - Yeah? Better bring the cheese then. Take a look ourselves. [door opens] [indistinct chattering] [typewriter clattering] [suspenseful music] [water dripping] [Raymond groaning] [water splashing] [Raymond gasping] [Raymond breathes heavily] [Raymond retching] - Oh, God! [lid tapping] A vampire. I've gotta kill her before it's too late. [Raymond breathes heavily] [objects clattering] [suspenseful music] [Raymond whimpering] [tools clatter] Yes. Yes, you are beautiful. [crowd chattering] - Excuse me. Excuse me! - Come on, come on. Keep going. [crowd chattering] [food crunching] Come on, ma'am, stay back. [crowd chattering] - Looks like quite a scene. - Yeah. - They didn't get the body. [crowd chattering] - My God, will you look at his face. Almost looks like he was eaten alive. Maybe it was some kind of animal, huh? - I don't know. - Right there, I'm sorry. Come on. - Hey, keep the press outta here! - Look, I'm not telling you again, I want you out of this area. - Yeah, yeah. - Bastards are like cockroaches, they'll do anything for a story. Huh. Wait a minute. What's this? [crowd chattering] [siren wailing] How about we pay a little visit to the Blue Angel this evening, hmm? See if you can get me a picture of this guy with his face on, meet me there at seven. [crowd chattering] [suspenseful music] - "The vampire may also transform into a hideous beast, mercilessly attacking their victims. Abandon all hope, those it does approach, the human soul will be eternally damned, yet if the victim stands up to this evil force, killing it with a stake through the heart, all shall be saved. But few victims ever have the courage to do this. Fearing the evil wrath of the Nosferatu." [suspenseful music] [knocking] - Raymond? Raymond? Raymond? I forgot my keys. [Jenny sighs] Come on. [chuckles] [taps on door] Quit playing games. Open the door. [suspenseful music] - Jenny. [lock clicks] [door creaking] - Hi. [door creaking] Is something wrong? - No, no, no. I was just, um, doing some research. - Raymond, you look terrible. - Well, I was up all night working. Don't worry about it. - Well, I do. Come here. Raymond, your ice cold. I'm gonna go get you some aspirin. - No. It's gonna be all right. - Just some aspirin and some juice. Okay? [suspenseful music] [door creaks and closes] Oh, I'm sorry I didn't call you last night, but I fell asleep early. I had the most strange dream too. It was, it was horrible. You were in some sort of danger and you were getting stabbed. It was awful. [aspirins rattling] Oh, and can you believe it? I actually slept walked. Mm-hmm. [suspenseful music] - Not to worry, Jenny. Everything's going to be all right. - I know. Ow! Raymond! [sighs] That really hurt. - I'm sorry. It's just that you look so tasty there and I couldn't control myself. Look, what do you say we get some air and go next door to Formosa for some lunch? - But you're obviously not feeling well. - Well, I'll probably feel better after I eat something. - Okay. - Okay. All right. [traffic whirring] [horns honking] [soft jazz music] - What'll it be? - I'll take a draft. Yeah? Um, nevermind. [Lou chuckles] - Lieutenant Lannon. Homicide. Ever seen this guy before? - Yeah, he comes in here all the time. - Yeah? Was in here last night? - Yeah. Something wrong? - Maybe. Was he with somebody? - Yeah, a woman came in I'd never seen before. [chuckles] He left with her. - What'd she look like? - Oh, well, you know, she was tall, uh, dark, sexy, huh. [chuckles] The ultimate woman. - Yeah, had a queer-looking dame, though. Had a real rage in her. - Sounds like quite a bird. What time is this? - Mm, midnight. - Hey Lou, can you be more specific about what she looked like? Like was she carrying anything like a purse or a bag? - Thanks for your time. - Sure. - Huh. [slow jazz music] [suspenseful music] [guard whistling] [door knob clattering] [guard whistling] - Breaking from Global Network, this is Fred Gannon. Our top story tonight, the bloody Griffith Park slaying of popular LA radio personality Brad Thompson, was found this morning by joggers, Thompson was the apparent victim of a mutilation murder. Police report no leads at this time. An investigation is underway. Global Network's Jim Woodson filed this report at the scene. [Vanessa snarling] [window shattering] [guard screaming] [glass cracking] [TV bangs] [sparks zapping] [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] [siren wailing] - You obeyed me. Good. [engine revving] - Why have you chosen me? - Be still. You brought me here so you will take care of my needs. You will take me back to Romania, to my husband. - Your husband? - Count Dracula, you fool. - [chuckles] I don't believe this. When do I wake up? Look, I am not going to Romania. And if you are who you say you are, you're a widow. [tires screech] [Raymond gasps] - My husband is not dead. [Raymond breathes uneasily] Who do they say killed him? - Van Helsing. [gasping] - Van Helsing? - Yes. [Raymond breathes heavily] - Come to me. Kiss me. [suspenseful music] [women laughing] [people chattering] - I'm serious. - I don't know. - I'm serious. - Jenny. Didn't you say Raymond wasn't home tonight? - Yeah, he wasn't feeling well. Why? - I think he's feeling better. [siren wailing] - By the way, uh, thank the wife for the pie. I appreciate it, but she shouldn't go to all that trouble. - Oh no, Hap, it's no trouble at all. You know how Sharon feels about you. Besides, this is what you get for being a bachelor at your age. Here you go. Hey, you know. That must have been some dame those guy saw at the Blue Angel. - Yeah. - Hey, wait a minute. You don't think a woman could have done that much damage to a body? - Maybe. - Jesus, Hap, he was what? Six feet tall. He was a big guy. - Money on it. - Yeah, right! You guys think I'm nuts. Look, it killed a man! This horrible, I'm saying monster 'cause that's what it is. It ripped open his neck and started chewing on his jugular and the blood, Jesus, you people! - Hey, hey, hey, take it easy, huh? I'm Lieutenant Lannon. Tell me all about it. Who was killed? - My friend, Dave. Dave Weston. - Yeah, where? - Yeah. What time? - Uh, 11:00, 11:30. Hollywood House of Wax. Look, we were robbing the place, but this horrible... [suspenseful music] - Horrible what, son? - Sir, his body was all messed up. And this thing's claws were ripping his neck open And it looked at me with these eyes. Now Dave's dead. And this thing's out there! I swear to God, you gotta believe me! It's out there! - Citrano. [suspenseful music] [man breathes uneasily] [books thumping] - Nosferatu. [suspenseful music] Huh. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [upbeat dance music] - Yo, man. We got the best thing in the world out here, you know? And if you really wanna see some women, I got all the women you need to see. - Stop. I told you to stop here! - Why? What is it? It's just some graffiti. It's the sign of devil worship. You're not going in there, are you? [upbeat dance music] - Raymond, come with me. [suspenseful music] [footsteps tapping] [metal clanks] Where are you? [wheel creaking] [Raymond gasps] [suspenseful music] [Raymond gasps] - You got business here? - Business? Um, no, um, I was just looking around. Um, actually, I was just on my way out. [blade clicks] [heels tapping] [suspenseful music] - We saw the pentagram. [eerie music] [group chanting] [wheel creaking] [woman groaning] [woman groaning] [knife scrapes] [woman gasping] [woman screaming] [knife slicing] [woman screaming] [group chanting] - [Group] Hail Satan! [group chanting] Hail Satan! [man screaming] - Ah, I sense your power. [intense music] [group chanting] Evil woman. [group hissing and screaming] [woman screaming] [Vanessa snarling] [flesh tearing] [Vanessa growling] [flesh tearing] [Vanessa growling] [man groans] [body thuds] [man screams] [body slams] [blood spraying] - Uh! [Vanessa growling] [flesh tearing] [man screaming] [intense music] [Vanessa growling] [flesh tearing] - Ow! [blood spurting] [lightning striking] [Vanessa growling] [man screaming] [phone ringing] - Hello? Oh, Jenny. What's wrong? - Raymond, I saw you last night with a woman and you were kissing her. - Jenny, listen. You don't understand, please. You don't know what I've been through. I love you. - You don't have to lie to me, Raymond. I saw it! You were kissing her! You really hurt me! - Jenny. [dial tone ringing] Jenny. [suspenseful music] [customers chattering] "Last night, she murdered a group of people in cold blood while I watched. And by being her unwilling slave, I feel so responsible for the people she's killed. God only knows how many others will die or when my own transformation will force me to take human lives without remorse. Jenny, find some place in your heart to forgive me. I do love you. Raymond." [suspenseful music] [pool balls clacking] [customers chattering] [traffic whirring] [keys jangling] [horn honking] [bottles clinking] [Raymond gasps] [keys jangling] - Raymond Everett? Boy, you sure are jumpy. [keys jangling] [Raymond chuckles nervously] My name's Hap Lannon. Police department. Could I ask you a few questions? It's not a good time? - Uh, no, please. Um, why don't you come in? Why don't I get us some chairs? I'll only be a second. - Fine. Hey, Raymond? Maybe you could turn on the lights? I haven't been in one of these places since I was a kid. I'd get a kick outta looking around. - Oh sure, um, I'll just hit the lights in the back room. - Thanks. [switches clicking] [suspenseful music] Wow. This is quite a place. I like what you've done. But you, you do all this yourself? - Yes I did, actually. I'm glad you like it. - Hmm. Pleasant. [Hap chuckles] You work alone? - Well, I am right now, yes. I, I'm preparing a new exhibit. We'll be closed for a couple weeks. But normally, my girlfriend Jenny manages the place. - Jenny? Huh. - That's a nice name. Jenny who? - Jenny Harker, sir. [marionette clattering] [Hap laughs] - Ah, can I look back here? - Well it's a bit messy. - That's okay. I don't mind, Had a fire in the museum, huh? - What? - Oh, one of the faces looked kind of charred back there. - Oh that. No, that's just some kids being prankster. I haven't had time to replace it. - Oh, this is where you do all your work, huh? - Yes. That's right. - Unbelievable. - Yes, it is. - Hey, some of this stuff is pretty valuable, huh? - That's right. - An old? - Mm. [suspenseful music] Lieutenant, would you care to see a monkey's head from Borneo? [laughs] - No, oh, that's okay. I, I've already seen, uh, I've seen a million of those. Poenari, Romania, huh? [both chuckle] Well that's a big crate. Two big crates. What do you guess is in here? Huh. [knocking on crate] Hello? Anybody home? [intense music] Uh, how come you haven't even opened these yet, huh? - Why are you here? Why are you asking me all these questions? - I guess it's kind of dumb, but you see this, uh, this crazy kid came into the, uh, precinct last night. [suspenseful music] And he said that he broke into your place with his buddy, uh, a guy named Dave Weston. You don't know any Dave Weston? - No, no. - No sign of any kind of break in here? - Mm, none. - [chuckles] he's crazy, but he said that his buddy got butchered in here. [suspenseful music] What do you know about that? - Butchered? Murdered? Well, I would've certainly phoned the police. That's absolutely ridiculous. [Raymond chuckles] - Yeah. [chuckles] I guess it's ridiculous, huh? [both laughing] [phone ringing] - Oh, excuse me. House of Wax. Lieutenant, the phone's for you. - No kidding. [suspenseful music] Yeah? - Hap, Hap, they just found 15 bodies in the red-light district. It's a rough scene, it's supposed to be a bloody mess in an abandoned warehouse. - Jesus Christ. - Come on, let's go. - Yeah, uh, 1666 Ivy Street. I'll meet you there in 10 minutes. [reporters chattering] - No, no, no. No, no, no. Citrano, stay here. Make sure nobody gets through the blockade. [suspenseful music] [shutter clicking] - Got it. - Hi, Lannon. - Jesus Christ. Never seen anything like this. What are we dealing with here, Bob? - I have no idea. Be careful there, boys. - Hey, hey, wait a minute! You, hold it! - Hey, old man! Come back here! - Hey, come here! - Uh, uh, oh. Oh, this must be stopped! - Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. I'm sorry, Hap. He snuck past the blockade. Come on, grandpa. Let's go. - No, wait! I must tell you what I know about this. - Now what do you want me to do? Carry you outta here? Come on! - Wait, wait, wait. I wanna hear what he has to say. Okay. What do you got to tell me? - I know who the killer is. [suspenseful music] - Okay, I'm listening. - This is not the work of devil worshipers. There is something even more evil in our midst. Vampires. - Come on. I haven't got time for this. We're dealing with a real psychopath here. Citrano. - Listen. I know you must think I'm a crazy old man, but please, please, give me this one chance. Take me to the other victims there have been. I can prove it to you. Much depends on the faith you have in me. [suspenseful music] Do you know, I was the grandson of the famed Dr. Van Helsing. He killed Dracula in 1893. He was a great man. - Is that so? Well I'm Sam Spade's nephew. Look, I'm a cop. I don't know much about myths or legends. Any of that stuff. But why don't you tell me where you were last night? - Well, I was at home! But please, please hurry up. Take me, take me to Fred Thompson's body. Yes, nurse! [suspenseful music] - Come on, Helsing. There's nothing you can show me in this morgue. Now cut the vampire crap. Tell me what you know about these murders. - Now tell me which one is the body? Come on! Which one is his body? - It's over here. - This one, this one is his body? Huh. [suspenseful music] Good, yeah, yeah. [chuckles] See the fang marks, huh? - I don't see anything but a torn up mess. Coroner says it was probably some kind of wild animal. - Well, he believes a wild animal attacked this man? Ha-ha! He too will learn. Ah, you see, vampires are experts at deception. They pray on, on innocence. They avoid the light. - Helsing, stop! - This was no wild animal attack! - Helsing, what are you doing? - In the name of my grandfather, [intense music] I destroy you! [hammer whacking] [vampire screaming] Ah, there. Come here, come here. Look, look, look. He has similar markings. Ha-ha! Mm-huh! Uh. Here, you want to try? [suspenseful music] [children playing] [knocking on door] - Hello. - I'm Lieutenant Lannon. Police department. I wanted to talk to Jenny Harker. Is she at home? - Oh, my. Nothing serious, I hope. - No, no. I just wanna ask her a few questions. - Oh, well, come in. - Thank you. - This way. [knocks] Honey, there's a policeman here to see you. Can he come in? - Okay. - Hello, Jenny. I'm Lieutenant Hap Lannon from the police department. [suspenseful music] I'd like to ask you a few questions. - Is it about Raymond? - Yeah. - Is something wrong? - Have you noticed any changes in him lately? - Mr. Lannon, I don't think I should be answering these questions. - I don't mean to get personal, but, uh, something happened between you two? - Yeah, we broke up. - You mind telling me about it? - There's nothing to tell. There's another woman in his life. - Yeah? Do you know her? Do you know her name? - Is Raymond in danger, Mr. Lannon? - Tell you the truth, I don't know. Are you gonna see him again? - Tonight at five. - Maybe you could tell him to call me at headquarters when he has time. - Okay. - Well, I'll be keeping in touch. Thanks for your time. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [Raymond panting] [Raymond slurping] - Oh, Jesus. What am I turning into? [gasping] [water splashing] [suspenseful music] - Raymond? [gasps] What happened to you? - Oh, hi, Jenny. Oh, huh, I bit my lip. [chuckles] - Well, you said you wanted me to meet you here, so... [Jenny chuckles] [Raymond chuckles] Raymond, why you looking at me like that? [suspenseful music] Stop it. You're frightening me. [sighs] Stop it. Now this supposed to be some sort of joke, it's not funny. [cries] Stop it! Stop it! - Jenny. Jenny, wait. I've got something for you. [soft dramatic music] It would mean a lot to me if you had this. I hope you like it. - Thank you, Raymond. I, I like it very much. [Raymond sighing] - [groans] Run. Oh, no. [keys jangling] [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] [Raymond gasps] Please. - Shut up! - No! [gasping] Look, don't, don't hurt me. Please. - Move! [Raymond groaning] [thunder rumbling] What's wrong? What is it? - Get upstairs! - What? - No! Oh! Oh. [groaning] So, you were with that girl Jenny again, weren't you? I told you to forget her. You're mine now! - She loves me. I can't just forget her. - She would only die for you. I would kill for you. - The Police Lieutenant Lannon was here. - Stop! If you ever tell him, betray me, I'm going to rip your heart out! [suspenseful music] Raymond, you have to take me back to Romania. To my husband. - Your husband is dead. [hand whacks] - Shut up! Oh, poor baby. Don't be frightened. [suspenseful music] [flesh squelching] [Raymond moaning] [Vanessa slurping] - Jenny. Jenny. [glass cracking] [water sloshing] [suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [heels tapping] [flesh squelching] [intense music] [Raymond gasps] Jenny. Jenny! You're up. [rotary dial clicking] [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] Come on. [Raymond gasping] God, Jenny. Jenny. Oh, Jenny. Oh. [keys jangling] Come on. Uh, Vanessa! Oh, you better not touch her! [engine revving] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] Jesus Christ. Come on! [intense music] [engine revving] [tires screeching] No:! Jenny! What have I done to you? - Raymond? - Jenny, - [gasps] What's wrong? [soft dramatic music] - You wore it. [breathes heavily] You wore it. [switch clicks] [lighter clicking] [knock on door] [drawer opens] - Come in. - Tap, just the man I wanna to see. - Have a seat. Mr. Caufield. - Tap, there's a few things I want to talk to you about. - Yeah? What about? - Well, appointment time's around the corner and as you well know, any good deputy police chief desires to become chief of police. - What does it got to do with me? - Ah, plenty, Hap. Aren't you in charge of investigating all of these recent serial killings? - Yeah. - So how's the progress? - There is no progress. Give us some time. [Caufield laughs] - Well you've had plenty of time. You've gotta get serious now. - Caufield, I've only been on the case for two days. - But Hap, you're the best. Look, 19 people just kicked the bucket and the way the media's got a hold of this, my chances for an appointment could go right down the drain. It's a political time bomb, Hap. [lighter clicking] - I'm not exactly thrilled about this either, Caufield, the way the media tends to exaggerate these things. - [chuckles] I didn't come here for a journalism lesson, Lieutenant. I want results now. [footsteps tapping] Just, uh, take care of it, Lannon, as if your career depended on it. [soft dramatic music] - [Citrano] "Hap, Helsing phoned. He said it was urgent. I went to check it out, so meet me at Helsing's when you get in. P.S. Enclosed in the envelope's a ticket for the weekend hockey game. I thought you should get your mind off things. Go check out something really violent for a change. Okay, see you soon. Citrano." [suspenseful music] - Helsing. [hisses] [dramatic orchestral music on radio] [footsteps tapping] - I thought you would come. I've been reading my manuscripts. You are Dracula's wife, huh, Vanessa? - And you are on Van Helsing's grandson. So, you must tell me, is it true? Did your grandfather kill my husband? - It is no myth. My grandfather did destroy Dracula. And God bless his memory for putting a stake through that. Monster's heart! - Then it's true. I'm a widow. - A widow! - Back! [grunts] - Please. It's a curse. I cannot help it. [breathes heavily] Oh, Dracula was no monster. He was a good man cursed. He loved me dearly. - He is evil. Yes. Look at it. Look upon the cross. Look at the symbol of all that's good and righteous. [Helsing chuckles and growls] [lightning striking] [Helsing laughing] - It hurts! [intense music] Please! Please, it hurts! - Feel the pain of good on you. Feel the pain of good on you. Feel the pain of good on you! [floor boards cracking] Uh! [cross clatters] [Helsing screaming] [fists pounding] [Vanessa snarling] [Helsing screaming] [flesh squelching] [lightning striking] [suspenseful music] - One more dismal night. And this, this vampire is still out there. It's hard to swallow, but I've seen the blood-drained victims, screaming corpses in the morgue. I must be going insane. Helsing's equipped me with enough of that damn white wood to kill a hundred vampires. I'm not a cop. I'm some sort of witch hunter. [group chattering] - [Man] Look at blood, Cindy. [group chattering] - It's horrible, isn't it? - Uh. - I heard a scream. So I called the police. They should be here soon. - Get out here! Go home! [suspenseful music] Sorry, Citrano. [stake stabbing] [Citrano screaming] [lightning striking] [heels tapping] Hey! [intense music] [Vanessa hissing] [lightning striking] [footsteps tapping] [Vanessa hissing] [lightning striking] [suspenseful music] [footsteps tapping] [bat squeaking] [wings flapping] Bitch! I'll get you for this! [wind whistling] [dramatic orchestral music] [door creaking] Helsing? [traffic whirring] Helsing, where are you? [dramatic orchestral music on radio] [Helsing growling] [intense music] [Helsing growling] [glass shattering] [foot thuds] [Helsing snarling] [books clattering] [body slams] [flesh squelching] [Helsing groaning] [soft orchestral music on radio] [glass clinking] [receiver clacks] [rotary dial clicking] [Hap sighs] [radio knob clicks] This is Lannon. Send me a search warrant for the Hollywood House of Wax. And get a meat wagon over to Helsing's Antique Shop. Helsing's walking with the dead. [sirens wailing] [motorcycles rumbling] [tires screeching] - Keep 'em back! Keep 'em back! [indistinct chattering] - Hey, move them people out of the way! [suspenseful music] [officers chattering] - Do you have those? - Yeah. - Damn good, job. I tell ya. [officers chattering] - Come on back here. We gotta get on a search. - Okay. [officers chattering] [shutter clicking] - We need another bag. You got another bag? [officers chattering] - "Last night, she murdered a group of people. I feel so responsible. God only knows when my own transformation will force me to take human lives." It's all here, Everett. We found Dave Weston's remains in your incinerator, and with this confession, I could put you away for the rest of your life. You're gonna need a damn good lawyer, boy. - I didn't kill anyone. - Sure, uh, read Count Dracula his rights, and, uh, get him outta here. [suspenseful music] Oh, hi, Lannon. - Who the hell made you a detective, Caufield? This is my case. - Correction. It's both of ours. Oh, and Lannon. I expect to see you at Everett's interrogation. [lighter clicking] Well, don't just stand there, cheer up. We just cracked this case. [suspenseful music] [reporters chattering] [shutters clicking] - Mr. Caufield, isn't it unusual for someone in your position to be bringing a suspect in? - [chuckles] I believe it only demonstrates just how committed we've been to solving this case, Nancy. - Well, are you saying that this arrest means the case is closed? - All suspects are innocent until proven guilty technically, but I know my family will sleep a lot easier tonight. - But when can we get the details? [reporters chattering] And so in what even a deputy police chief says is a major breakthrough in the recent string of killings, police closed in tonight on the Hollywood House of Wax. - Let's try it again, Everett. Who killed Dave Weston? - I don't know Dave Weston. - He was tortured in your museum, incinerated in your oven, and that name doesn't ring a bell? - I've already told you, no. - Tell me again. - What for? You don't care what I say. - What I want is the truth. - I told you the bloody truth! - What you've been telling us, Everett, is a pack of fairy tales. Vampires. Try again. [head bangs] [Raymond gasps] - You're a glutton for punishment, aren't ya, Everett? Then again, maybe a psycho like you is into the pain, huh? - Uh! [Raymond breathes uneasily] I didn't kill anyone. Oh! - The hell he didn't. - What about Brad Thompson? What about those devil worshipers down in the red-light district? We found your stinking little fingerprints. [Raymond inhales] [hand slams] - Look, it wasn't me. It was her! - What, some vampire woman? Give us a break, Everett. [knob clicks] - Uh, Lieutenant. I wanna hear this. - He's obviously exhausted. You're mistreating him. The kid has his rights. - Not in my book, he doesn't. He's a killer, and either he's the best liar I've ever seen, or he is a complete psychopath. And I'm certainly not worried about whether or not he's feeling well. - Caufield, I don't know how you ever became my boss, but it sure wasn't because you're a good cop. - Okay, Lannon, have it your way. Now it's my case and you stay the hell away from him. [suspenseful music] [footsteps pattering] [insects chirping] [indistinct chattering] [cell door scrapes and clanks] - I believe your story, Raymond. I believe all that happened to you. Now you've gotta tell me where I can find this Countess Dracula before it's too late. [suspenseful music] - Look, you don't know what you're up against. [chuckles] You don't know what she turns into. Just stop bothering me. - How long has this been going on for? What are you gonna do? Allow yourself to brutally kill people? - [breathes uneasily] I'm a slave. - I can get you out of here if you'll help me find her. The book says that you can save yourself if you kill her yourself, stake her through the heart. - No, no I can't! - Goddammit, she killed my partner! Now you tell me where she is! - No, I've already betrayed her once. She's gonna come here and get me. [laughs] She'll get you too. [suspenseful music] - All right. I'm gonna find her myself. And if I have to stake her myself, I'm gonna be back to get you. [Raymond gasps and hisses] - Raymond! What the hell are you doing here? Who gave you permission? I thought I told you to stay away from that maniac! [Caufield gasps] You'll never work again, Lannon. I'll see to it. [suspenseful music] [footsteps tapping] [objects clattering] [door creaking] [door closes] - Jenny, what are you doing here? - I wanna help. Is what Raymond said about that vampire true? - I'm afraid so. We've gotta hurry. We've gotta find her coffin before sunset. [suspenseful music] [crowbar clinking] - [sighs] Why can't we find her? - Because she isn't here. She had all last night to find a new hiding place. - But what are we gonna do now? - Raymond did say that she'd be after him. We better get back to the jail. [suspenseful music] [water dripping] [rats squeaking] [lid creaking] [rats squeaking] [lid clattering] - [hissing] Raymond! [echoes] Raymond! [echoes] Raymond! [Vanessa hissing] [intense music] [manhole cover scraping] [thunder rumbling] [train horn blaring] [men chattering] [thunder rumbling] [men chattering] - Oh! [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] [phone ringing] - Can I help you, miss? - I demand you tell me where Raymond is. - Raymond, Raymond, who? [suspenseful music] You must mean Raymond Everett. Um, he was actually transferred to city hospital about a half an hour ago. [officer gasping] [feet tapping] [neck snaps] [officer gasps] [body thuds] [intense music] [thunder rumbling] [horns honking] [wings flapping] - So, uh, what's the tape recorder for? - We're gonna get a confession. - What are you talking about, confession? - From what I hear, the brass wants a confession out of this guy more than anything, so if we got the confession, we wouldn't have to drive his ambulance anymore. - Yeah. - I mean, we're just gonna rough him up a little. So what do you say? We partners? - Okay, you won me over. - I know just the place too. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] [door closes] - How's he doing? [stretcher clattering] - Okay, Everett. End of the line. [Raymond snarling] - Look at this freak. He really thinks he's a vampire. [Raymond snarling] - Oh! - You're gonna talk. You see, we've decided to give you one last, uh, opportunity to confess. [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] - We can't stay here. She'll come for us. Do you want to die? Ask your Lieutenant Lannon! [chuckles] He knows. [bat shrieking] [wings flapping] [intense music] [window shattering] [bat shrieking] [wings flapping] [man screaming] [flesh squelching] [gun clinks] - Oh, no! [gun fires] [door slams] [bat slurping] [gun firing] [bullet ricochets] [bat hissing] [gun fires] [bullet ricochets] [bat slurps and hisses] [bones cracking] [bat growling] [gun firing] [trigger clicks] [bat shrieking] [trigger clicking] [man screaming] [gun clinks] [Vanessa snarls] - Stop! Raymond! - What are you talking about? - He's near us! I can feel it! She's trying to kill him! Look. He's in there. [suspenseful music] - It's Hap Lannon. Send a patrol unit, Horton Warehouse. [sirens wailing] [engine revving] [intense music] [Vanessa growling] [Raymond gasping] [siren wailing] - Raymond, you've betrayed me. Now you'll die. [Raymond gasping] [Vanessa hissing] [door clattering] [ambulance rumbling] - Oh, Jenny! [door slams] [Vanessa growling] Please! [siren wailing] [wall smashing] [tires screeching] [Vanessa growling] Stay back! [gun firing] [Vanessa groaning] - Stay away from him. He's mine! [suspenseful music] - No! [gun fires] - Ow! - No, please! Get back! - Hey, heads up, catch! - No, Raymond! Help! Help! Help, Raymond, Raymond! - No! [stake stabbing] [Vanessa shrieking] [sirens wailing] [soft dramatic music] - Raymond. How could you? [flesh squelching] [Vanessa hissing] [flesh squishing] [soft dramatic music] - It's over now. [remains sizzling] It's all over. [soft dramatic music] [lightning striking] [intense music] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [lightning striking] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling]
