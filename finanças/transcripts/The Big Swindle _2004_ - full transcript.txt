The cops mentioned Master Kim, right? Anyway, Gasoline was talking about Chang-hyuk to Master Kim That's why I mentioned your name He said he's got a 5-billion won job in mind When was he released? It's been 5 days Choi Chang-hyuk, huh? How is he? He's pretty genuine His nickname is 'Tongue' He lies well he's good-looking, and he likes to gamble Guys who like to gamble usually have a good heart Guys like me. Tell him to come by. Gasoline and Master Kim finished discussing it Then Chang-hyuk came right after his release Is Master Kim in? Who are you? You must be his daughter There's no Master Kim here Wait a minute. Wait! By any chance Choi Chang-hyuk? Yes, I'm a bit popular He's not in right now He'll be in by this year He asks for a busy guy like me, and he's no show? What a nice place Master Kim did pretty well I've got gas in my stomach from this apple Got anything to drink? Something expensive? Pick one from here You know how to drink wine, right? Wine! I like wine of course There's no Chilean You like Chilean wine? It's not that I dislike French wine, but you know how those Germans totally wiped out France in the war So many people died And so did all those wine fields All the originals burned down Then they planted the seeds again, but they don't grow in a day But Chile still has its original People who don't know much keep looking for French wine You got ripped off big time I didn't buy it And what kind of crazy fool keeps his wine like this? I think it's pretty like this Look at all these bright lights It's too warm They'll all rot They will? What the hell is this crap? The wine's temperature is crucial It's the same as people It's cold here, right? It's cold here. It's a bit warm here, right? It's warmer here, right? And here no need to explain So what was your name? You're a complete con! Why isn't Master Kim here yet? After the Gulf War, the UN put sanctions on Iraq's economy Any international trade or transaction with the dinar was absolutely forbidden But, rumors were spreading in Korea's black market that when the sanctions are lifted, each one of these will be worth 1 million won Pass it around Tempting, isn't it? The dealers bought each bill for about 3,600 won Then they sold it for 22,000 won I bet you that our Korean banks have piles of them stocked up But then what happened? The sanctions weren't lifted The Americans went and changed the currency People who bought the dinar were going broke This is a swindle The smarter you are the easier you get cheated Where else will you learn this? You need to fix your workout. Look ahead 35 degrees higher, and breath in and out Breath in and out, good. Abebe ran like this, and won all the marathon trophies This is the best way to prevent pleurisy Breath in and out Oh, Master Kim! Who the hell are you?

You didn't ask from who? It's the Bank of Korea Here's the gist of my plan This stuff is top secret You know what's in the bank's safe, right? Cash, stocks, bonds, negotiable certificates of deposit, bills, and even gold bars, It looks impossible to me You must be catching a cold Ask someone else If I wanted to ask someone else, why would I be here? Think I came here to check the meter? Is it that job four years ago? What? Rumors have it that job four years ago froze up your balls Rumors? Big companies will take that money and use it for themselves anyway You're gonna just let that happen? My balls froze up? What asshole said that?

He bought the books in Almata Yes I wore you out today didn't I? To be frank I liked Chang-hyuk When he came over for the barbeque, Chang-hyuk was smoking on the roof He looked so handsome Is he that handsome? I can't forget him His smile, his walk the way he smokes It was the afternoon and I felt a bit weary You see, I get weary in the afternoon Like a pussy cat Come inside This is my bookstore The phone Right Yes, may I help you? Chang-ho you seem busy so I'll leave you alone Why don't you have some coffee first? I'll come, by later. Is it okay if I call you Chang-ho? Yes, of course 'Jung In-sook looked at him with the blank eyes of a deer' 'I'm sorry' 'As her water drop skirt moves farther away he felt as if he'd never forget her' This guy's a subtle romantic So he loves his younger brother's lover This is boring Sounds like some date or phone number There's 10 of them right? Captain did you listen to it? To what? Oh I thought it was some music tape You know how many years I tried to catch Master Kim He even walked away four years ago What happened four years ago? He set up an investment fraud for a fake entertainment company The victims were two teachers The math teacher killed himself He put up his students' tuition The language teacher disappeared So what's on this? Two days before Master Kim went into the Bank of Korea, we got an anonymous phone call It was some woman She said that Master Kim is plotting something in two days I didn't know whether to trust her So I asked one of my juniors a favor You bugged him That's illegal I'll leave things to you now When you got married, I gave you 1 million won That was a lot back then Yeah, but you gave it to the bride, idiot Come to think of it, Assoline didn't give me any money I was in the can then But you still should've paid Damn it! You got divorced anyway. Whenever his wife talked back, he packed her a one-two punch From our feminist point of view, that's not right Penisism? I said I was going to divorce her, and her brother came with a 4X4 To beat me to death If Big Mouth hadn't stopped him, he would've smashed me Five? Big Mouth, that bastard Hey, when he wasn't on drugs, he was in great shape Back then was my golden years Still have the strength? I don't use any strength I use my head Lift up this table I couldn't lift this long time ago What's wrong? But raising it now would be a con Stop with the show and deal! I have to fold I bet 100,000 Raise you three more I got your three See if those checks are real Raise you five more This is my last game folks 13 million more take it all Someone's treating to the club Call, I will - This will fool anybody - Four of a kind Look at this Wait, Big Mouth had an ace before Freeze! Don't move, damn it I'm pretty patient. But not with cheating on cards. Hey! Why'd you break the mood? Gasoline, play with my money Hey, the odds on that is 0.1936% You're really fun Master Kim, it wasn't because of the money Clear it up for another round! Master Kim, it wasn't because of the money Clear it up for another round! Assoline That bastard Chang-hyuk has got no respect Give me some more Hey, do you wanna team up? - Team up? - Yeah How could we double-cross Master Kim when we're all family? Family, my ass We're just a bunch of swindlers A bunch of swindlers? - So what's your plan? - My plan? Hit and run! So who could this woman be? Seo In-kyung? Detective Park is trailing her, right? After they met in the afternoon, she's back now with her belongings How should I know why she's here? The real estate agent told me that Master Kim put out the house, and a new owner's moving in tomorrow Thank you So what will you do? I can't reach my friend in Suwon And a motel is too scary That's too bad A really sexy college student used to live in our neighborhood While I was writing a letter to her, Chang-hyuk kicked the door open, and wanted to fight for her I asked him if he was crazy I suppose he liked that girl, too You two must like the sexy type So who won? Me, of course I was kind of good at taekwondo back then. Then two days later, both of them ran off together Women are so strange Why do they like that sleazy style? Guys like Chang-hyuk how would I put it... Makes girls nervous and uneasy, while also excited And he makes you want to follow him till the end I met him by coincidence Was it in the park? He was readin the paper you see Mister, you know how dirty this water is? The city says it's clean but that's all a lie Didn't you see the paper? You could die from drinking this Breathe in and out! What a coincidence! What brings you here? I was reading the paper, and I felt like jogging suddenly Wait a minute! The roof won't cave in so come sit down I just feel like standing I have to go home fast because of Master Kim Are you some kid? Will Master Kim give you a whipping? He'll kill me Think I'm that crazy to jog everywhere like that? Stop it and come sit here So what will you show me? You're so mean If you had sat down, that wouldn't have happened So come sit I think I injured my back while jogging Lie down for a second No! I just wanted to brief you on my future plans, so lie down for a sec. What's that? You can see it better if you lie down I made a pledge with my brother I'm gonna buy that land and build a pension there When the 5-day workweek comes, people will want to relax They'll come in droves later I'll make sacks of money Isn't that enough? Enough for us to get hitched Why are you living like this? Like what? You cook and do all his chores That's a depressing lifestyle What's bad about it? Hold on This angle is art Run on this side This isn't funny Hold on Amazing Your skin is so beautiful Who is it? It's me What brings you here? Were you with a woman? No way! The time you spent to answer the door was just enough for a girl to hide In the state we're in how could I see a woman? Wait a minute Would you like a beer? Great Here's my plan for getting the checks Take a look This is a great idea Of course since it's my idea What's that? Oh, that? When I finish this project, I'm gonna hide there quietly, and run a pension there Pension? Don't you have one of those by now? At my age you need only three things Money, a belly and pride Is the bathroom this way? Mister Choi come by in the morning Let's have breakfast Sure Master Kim your sweety's hiding in here You bastard I hate you! So I got away safely that day It could've been really bad Miss Seo Yes? I don't mind you staying here But could you not talk about Chang-hyuk? You can sleep here You're an AB blood type right? Yes, right You can eat what you like in the kitchen Just turn the lights on and off here If you feel stuffy go out on the balcony here for some fresh air When's your birthday? February 5th Then Chang-hyuk's birthday I'm sorry I wasn't going to mention him That's okay He was born on December 23rd Have a good rest You, too! Damn What the hell happened in August? Okay I'm in for now The game is over You're all dead I got lots of time You and Swallow teamed up but you don't know where he is? Captain, I know a bit about Kafka Kafka? What's that? Absurdity I'm friends with Swallow, but I don't know where he lives You're really incredible Detective Kim What's that girl's name who Swallow dated? Her name is Cho Kyung-nan Go find her Captain, you think he'd be with the girl he swindled? Buddha can't even predict relationships - Go find her now! - Yes Be careful on the road Big Mouth When did you start the drugs again? Didn't I tell you that life's absurd? Quitting is easy I've quit over 100 times But when Chang-hyuk asked where to get some I said Hey, boy Hey, boy! I said to Chang-hyuk Anything that's addictive can kill you Crack Mah-jong Marijuana Cocaine Horse racing I got it, pussy What, pussy? You said anything that's addictive Who are you calling a pussy? Wait, that's them isn't it? Hold on I thought you quit So I was going to buy Chang-hyuk one stick But now they don't sell just one How much is a stick? We sell five in a set So if Chang-hyuk takes one, how many is there left? You teaching me math boy? I'm sorry There's four What's life got to offer? Absurdity Okay, let's go What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with what? - Let's go! Now, turn around Freeze! Don't move I told you all not to move Freeze Don't move!

That's common sense Tell me The law laid it out If a customer wants to withdraw money, the bank can't run out, right? So the bank must always have from 10 to 15 percent in cash That's what it is That's right If the bank runs short of cash, the Bank of Korea provides them with it Everybody okay? - Okay - Okay So the Bank of Korea gives out current deposit checks to each bank to make a withdrawal If you present the checks at anytime, they will give you cash And the account is settled at year-end What we forged are those very checks Go get our money. I just need to check I heard that you all are restructuring lately Is this true?
