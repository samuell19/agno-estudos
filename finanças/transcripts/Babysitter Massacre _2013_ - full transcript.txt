[PANTING AND CRYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Are you sure you're sick? Yes. I feel hot and achey. You aren't just saying that to stay home from school? No. So you must be too sick to go trick or treating then, right? I don't know. I think you must be. Oh, come on. I tell you what. If you go and lay down and get lots and lots of rest, maybe you'll feel better by the time we're ready to go out tonight, and you can go trick or treating. How's that sound? You got it! So go to your bedroom and get to it. Thank you, Linda. No problem, kid. [PHONE VIBRATING] I just scored myself some peace and quiet. [PHONE VIBRATING] Too old for Halloween. Tough gig. [PHONE VIBRATING] Damn it! God! What? [PHONE VIBRATING] [PHONE VIBRATING] [PHONE VIBRATING] [SCREAMING] Please, help me! Please, leave me alone! [SCREAMING] Please, no! No! No, no, no, no! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Good morning. Hey there. How's your day been? Brief, I guess. I used to think sleeping in was great. Now I can't seem to sleep past 8:30 without feeling like I've wasted the whole day. Even after retiring? Maybe it's just corporate conditioning. I like to think that I am being productive. I mean, I always like to have things to do. --[SHIVERING] Aren't you cold out here? You know, I guess so. I didn't really think about it. When I'm feeling down, I just like to sit out here and look at the houses. Feel some of the life out there. Gets lonely in this house. How you holding up? Fine. Until I got that letter from the county. Death in absentia. It's been seven years. Now as far as Dakota County is concerned, April is officially deceased. I'm so sorry. Thanks. It isn't new to me. But seeing it in black and white just stings. No more police reports, no insurance companies nosing around looking for fraud. Just nothing left. I wish I knew what to say. There really isn't anything to say, is there? I guess not. I'd be pretty shocked if you could lay down words and make it all better. I'd tell you to sell it on daytime TV. I miss her, too. I just-- I just try not to feel like a failure as a father. You're not to blame. Save it. I've heard that speech. But she was on my watch. And the only consolation left in my life now is watching you grow up next door. I-- You got your plans made out for the day? Did you pick out your costume? I-- I don't dress up anymore. But, um, I'm having some friends over. It'll be fun? Yeah. Good. I feel better already. You go have yourself a good rest of the day, Angela. I will, Mr. Walker. Call if you need anything. Will do, kiddo. Mom, is that you? Hello, baby! Jesus [INAUDIBLE] Christ, you scared the hell out of me! 'tis the season. You are twisted. And your mom's an accomplice. You're just trying to see me naked, you lesbo pervert. Well, you better believe it. Whip out them titties for me. [LAUGHS] Get out. Fine. You're no fun. I saw your butt, too. Jesus. The nightmares are back? Yeah. In a big way. I'm-- I just keep seeing him over and over in my mind. 'tis the season. Yeah, but now I feel like they're getting less blurry. And it's still the guy with the white face? Head. His entire head is white. He comes in, and he grabs April, and he pushes me aside, and he takes her away. And I run away. You were 14. You couldn't do anything. I let her go. OK. Breathe for me. Survivor's guilt is such a bitch. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I don't know what I would do without you. All of the other girls blame me. They only blame you because that's the only way that they could process it. We all got together, and in our suburbanite wisdom, formed a babysitters' club. And when reality hit us in the face, we fell apart. But we were all just in our costumes, and laughing, and getting candy, and having a good time. And then she was gone. And then everyone else was gone. Everyone except you. Look. I'm sure not all the girls feel that way anymore. Right. I'm having a few of them over for a party tonight. Maybe you can drop by and join the party. What kind of party is it? A slumber party. You're kidding me. [LAUGHING] For old time's sake. Come on. Tonight is about feeling like kids again. Maybe that can apply to old friendships, too? Yeah. You won't feel ashamed for inviting the weird girl over? No way. But just wait a couple hours until the social lubricant has flowed through the veins. Just like when we were kids, huh? Yeah, except this time, we don't have to steal the liquor. [LAUGHING] But we can if we want a thrill. You're so impressive. But you're rotten on the inside. Kind of like my ex-boyfriend. Oh well. Sorry. Hey. I kind of want to skip the party. It's been a really long day. No, I kind of just want to go home, have some popcorn, unwind, take my shoes off. All right, I'll think about it. No problem, sis. Yeah, OK. I'll call you later. All right, bye. [GASP] You're gonna freeze your booty off. It'll be better than a hot cup of coffee. I think the wind chill's like 28 degrees. That's a great way to feel alive. You're crazy. And you're a pussy. If you want to go ahead and jump in, be my guest. But I'm going to put my costume on. It's party time. Suit yourself. Get it? I didn't even mean to do that. A poet and a scholar. OK, maybe this one time I was wrong. Tony? Are you decent? I want to see this surprise costume of yours. Nice. So what are you? I get it. A tampon. Nice and absorbent. Did you pick that costume up at a leather bar, or did you just cut out the middleman and blow a dude for it? OK, now you're creeping me out, and I can't think of any more insults. So I'm going to go get changed. [SCREAM] Why are you doing this? Let me go! Please, let me go! Why are you doing this? Please, stop! Please stop! Please stop! No! No! [SCREAMING] Please, please, just let me go! Please, please, no! No! No! There's plenty of soda in the fridge. That cherry kind you like. What's wrong, sweetheart? It's just a terrible day. What do you mean? Halloween. It was starting to get easier, but now I feel like I've taken a giant step backwards. All my friends are out of whack, and it's the only speck on an otherwise stereotypically boring middle class neighborhood. Boring? Boring is good. I miss boring. I just feel selfish. I want to have fun this time of year, and then I see how everyone else is affected. You had a talk with Mr. Walker. Yeah. He's wrecked. She was his entire world. Mr. Walker's choosing not to move on. He's choosing to go outside every day and look at the neighborhood and remember when April was alive. He's making himself relive the pain. Should he just forget about her, then? Of course not. But you can honor memories and still embrace life. You know, sadness is a simple feeling. It rarely offers up anything unexpected. When we're sad, it's a comfort, because we're exhausted from all the shock and the pain and being jerked around. We just sit there like a lump, feeling sad while we heal. The sadness is like a brace or a crutch. If we're not careful, we can come to rely on it long term, and then the depression becomes all-- all we know, and all we're willing to know. That's so sad. It's not just sad. It's pitiful. It's a coward's way out, and a guaranteed way never to put yourself out there and have new experiences. It's no way to live, and I know for a fact I raised you to be smarter and more courageous than that. [LAUGHING] I hate that. What? How you're always right about everything. [LAUGHING] It's amazing how much I've learned in just a few short years, huh? Oh, oh yeah, how many years is that again? Lalalala, I can't hear you! Oh, come on. Did you meet Ike Eisenhower? Oh, not funny, and I can't hear you! Oh, mom, you're such a [INAUDIBLE] How do I look? [LAUGHING] Like a big pussy! I'm glad I raised such a mature young woman. I'm-- I'm sorry. You look great. Are you gonna snag you a frat boy or two? Minimum of two. Hmm. You know what I just realized? You're not dressed as a kitten. You're dressed as a cougar. I know. Come on, I'm kidding. I'm not! [LAUGHING] [KNOCKING] Well, I think our mother daughter bonding time has reached its critical mass. So, um, you've got to go out there and get out on the town, you party animal. Trick or treat! Jeez. What are you dressed as? Your best friend? [LAUGHING] Jesus Christ, you're too adorable for words. Get in here. Lucky, how are you, darling? I'm great. How are you? Oh, this is going to be cheesy. You ready for it? Purr-fect. Oh, well! Uh, mom better get going. Otherwise, she's going to be late for the prowl. The prowl? Don't ask. Good night, girls. Have a wonderful time, and, uh, don't wait up. Good night. Good night. Your mom is great. Couldn't love her any more if I tried. So my first-- [PHONE VIBRATING] Ugh. What is it? God, Linda keeps sending her these awful pictures of she and the girls dressed up in their Halloween costumes. God, they really went for it this year. Oh, that is so gross. It looks like ketchup. If it looks fake, then why are you grossed out? I hate ketchup. So did they say when they're getting here? Well, they should be trickling in as the evening progresses, but, um, some of them probably can't drive from the big party. So we might be picking them up. So should we wait to get into the bottle of wine that we brought, then? Hell no! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, uh, so you're tearing through it now, huh? Yeah. At this point, I'm just firing blindly into the air in any direction. Did you remember to breathe? Yeah, yeah. Did you file the Johnson papers? Twice. I think it's about that time. I'll go shut off the lights and lock the door. Run, go, your youth is at stake! Going home alone. What the shit? Hey, come on. I wasn't trying to scare you. Old habits die hard. Interesting choice of terms. What do you want? Hey, come on. I just want to talk to you. That's funny, because I had hoped that I'd never have to speak to you again. Hey, come on. Give me a chance. We were best friends once. Do you remember junior high? Yeah, of course. I remember a babysitters' club. Made all kinds of money to buy chips and candy. Well, that's what I remember, too. I also remember one year you wanted to go trick or treating, but it was so cold and snowing out, nobody wanted to go. We didn't want to freeze our tits off. But April? She went with you. You know why? Do you? I don't. She believed in the buddy system. She wanted you to be safe. But you know what the flaw was in her plan? Do you? No. That her fucking buddy would run off and leave her to be abandoned and murdered. Hey, come on! It didn't happen like that! So what happened? Did you fight back? When some weirdo came up, did you yell for help? Did you throw your bag of candy at him? I was just a kid! So was she! And now she's nothing! When I look at you, I don't see your face. I see my friend rotting in a ditch somewhere. Why don't you wipe those tears off your face and get the fuck out of my office? Sandra, I am so, so sorry. Sorry's not going to help anything! Our friendship's just like April. Dead in the fucking ground. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my God, that is so gross. I know. It must have taken hours to get it right. I can't even see the edges. Uh, I can see them a little, but I think they get an A for effort. It's kind of freaking me out. Are you guys talking about me? How did you get in here? Your door is unlocked. Which I really don't think is a good idea, considering it's Halloween night. Well, we were just distracted by these gnarly pics Linda's been sending us. Ooh, let me see them. They are really into the costumes this year. Dumb. Gross. Fake. Stupid. Oh, how I've missed you. I'm in pretty high demand. I just re-broke up with Dave. Again? Again again. I think this is like the sixth breakup? Why do you keep breaking up with him? He's a total bore. I mean, every time I break up with him, it's like a spark goes off behind his eyes. Suddenly he's interesting and intriguing, and he just thinks of all these ways to woo me that he's never thought of before. That's sweet. Yeah, in a sick, sociopathic kind of way. Oh, come on. Like you bitches never misled a guy just to get what you wanted. Not really. Never? You've never misled a guy? Nope. You've never manipulated a guy, Lucky? Ever? Well, one time. Go on. I ordered a medium popcorn when I wanted a large. What? I love popcorn, but I just didn't want him to think I was a pig. Besides, it was only $0.15 more, too. You're a moron. Oh, why don't you loosen your talons just a bit? Just because you're as pure as white snow does not give you the right to judge me. We're not judging you. We're just-- laughing at you? [LAUGHING] What am I? A joke? OK, maybe it was a poor choice in words. [KNOCKING] More trick or treaters? I think it's a little late for that. Well, let's just go see who it is. What is it? It's a box. You know, like the thing between your legs. Mmm, this seems like a prank. Doesn't smell like dog shit, and it's not on fire. Then open it. What is it? Fancy panties. OK, this is creepy. Everybody get inside now. This is really weird. Come on, you guys need to relax a little bit. I don't like the idea that someone just air dropped panties onto my porch. It is a little weird. This is so totally David. Aww, did you have an accident and he had to bring you fresh panties? No. It's like the movie. He knows I love horror movies, and he's trying to recreate it for me. He's such a genius when he's trying to get me back. There's a movie where girls are alone in a house in lingerie? Sorority House Massacre 2. So what? We're supposed to dress up in lingerie to feed his perverted fantasy? No. We're supposed to dress up in lingerie to feed my perverted fantasy. I don't know. Oh, come on. What else are we going to do tonight besides watch TV and drink? Screw it. I'm in. But I get to keep whatever I wear. His credit card, not mine. Hello there. I kind of wanted my nap to go on a little longer, but I guess you have something else in mind? Well, mister big, scary Halloween man, if you're going to be so silent, how will I ever know what you want from me? I guess I'll just have to use my imagination. Is this what you had in mind? I know. Maybe I need to play with your sweet tooth. I think I've played alone enough. Why don't you give me a big surprise? [MOANING] I love that. [GASP] You've got to be fucking kidding me. Hey. New place. Same job, huh? I've never had a problem with it. Well, you should. You've had the same job since you were 17. To me, that just screams townie. And where do you work? The Gap? I work at Record Town. Ah, see, now it all makes sense. So you've got an image to uphold, so it's going to be indie and downtown and involving vinyl? And this is just like old times. It wasn't fun talking to you then, either. Can I just pay for the pizza? What's wrong? You look pissed. I'm always pissed. No, not your usual pissed. Have you been crying? You know, I'd really love to pay for this pizza and have you back out of my life. I'm just worried about you. A lot of good that does me! You weren't worried about me when you fucking dumped me! Jesus Christ, that was two years ago. And I said I wanted to be friends. I'm not friends with scumfuckers who dump their girlfriends for no fucking reason. I can't defend myself to you, but you seriously look terrible. Well, thanks, pigfucker. No, you look really upset. Yeah, well, seeing your face can ruin anyone's day, OK? I'm gone, OK? But if you need anything, you can call me. I've got the same number. Same number, same job, same stupid fucking haircut. Tyler Patrino, a testament to progression. Try sucking a fucking dick! That went better than I thought it would. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR BELL] Your boyfriend's weird. Ex-boyfriend. Wow, look at that. You've got tits and everything. Thanks. You look great in that. Only way it could be better is if we just some blood on your chest. Like from the movie? Sometimes I try to follow you and it never works out for me. Go slip your bony ass into something. So ridiculous. Ooh, look at that. It's black, like my soul. I like it. What are the other girls gonna think when they find us here dressed up like this together? I guess they'll think we're rug munchers. Oh, charming. It's OK. I have a few extra pairs. I'll have to twist their arm. Did you pick something out? I got this. Can I ask you something? Sure. Does Arlene hate me? Oh, no, sweetheart. She doesn't hate you. She just has a strong personality, and she knows you're not assertive, so she pushes you around. I don't like it. Well then, stand up to her, and then she'll quit. Do you really think that'll work? It works in prison. On TV. OK, girls, get ready. Pretty great, huh? You are twisted. Come on. Don't act like you've never seen a pair of titties before. Just put on your stuff. Why? Because. Why should I get dressed? I don't know. It's cold. It's cold? Really? I don't feel cold. Now you're telling me how I feel? No. Then what is it? Do I make you uncomfortable? No. Just admit it. My hot naked body makes you uncomfortable. I-- Arlene, enough. I--I don't know. I-- I'm just trying to understand where your friend and mine is coming from. So just admit it. You're intimidated. Yeah. It's OK. I'll go put some clothes on. See? That wasn't so difficult, now, was it? It wasn't him. It-- it was a-- a frat boy in a Halloween costume. It wasn't him. It-- fuck. This is my color. I like it. No, really. I mean, this is my color. If anyone else tries tow ear it from now on, I'm gonna go all Disney on their ass and sue them. Whoa, I'll keep that in mind. Is that a retroactive license? Of course not. I'm not greedy. [LAUGHS] Yeah. [KNOCKING] Guys, that's gotta be him. Come on, let's go to the door together, all in our outfits. How do you know it's him? Have any other girls texted you back about coming? No, they've all gone pretty quiet. Then who else could it be? Come on. (WHISPERING) [INAUDIBLE] door, Angela. (WHISPERING) Privacy! Oh! Hi, Mr. Walker! Uh, something I can help you with? No, no. That's all right. Uh, I just wanted to bring you this. It's the leftovers from my trick or treating. I thought you might use it for your party. Oh, great. Thank you. Great. Are you all right, Angela? Uh, yeah. Just a little underdressed for the occasion. Oh, well, don't worry about that. You know, I used to be young once, too, you know. Your secret is safe with me. Oh, and, uh, if you need anything at all, you just call. I'll be up all night. OK. Thanks. I appreciate it. Goodnight, girls. Good night. Good night, Mr. Walker. They grow up so fast. [LAUGHING] That is the only time that that could happen. We have the worst luck. I think I want to change. No. You're gonna stick with it. I'm feeling cold. Then we'll turn up the thermostat. Dave's gonna be here soon, and I want him to see his plan worked on me. You're not screwing on my bed. Just give it like 20 more minutes. [SIGH] Anticipation is the best part. [SCREAMING] Ugh. I can't eat any more. What is it? It's more pictures. It looks like the girls have chose the downtown party over us. Fuck them. We're the cream of the crop anyway. More wine is what we seem to need. I happen to have some right here. I knew there was a reason I liked you, bitch. [LAUGHING] Oh, let's put on some TV. I think I found us something to do. What's that? I don't know. [KNOCKING] What do we do? We answer the door, idiots. I don't like the idea of giving anybody else a free peek. Then I'll answer the door. You guys set up the game board. I love that [INAUDIBLE]. If it's Dave, then you let him in. With pleasure. Hey, Arlene. Did someone order a cunt? Oh. Bianca. Come-- come on in. Thanks. Now I feel, uh-- I feel a little overdressed, guys. Don't ask. Fair enough. So, did you stop by the party downtown? Yeah, for a minute. Why don't you play with us? Come on, an Ouija board? Aren't you curious? About? What the spirits have to say. Those things don't work. How do you know? This board is a tool for contacting the souls of those who have already passed on. And you can get them at Toys R Us. [INAUDIBLE]. Everybody sit down. The more hands on the planchette, the better the connection will be. This is so silly. Everybody put your fingers on the planchette. What do we do now? We ask it a question. Like what? Hold onto your britches, bitches, I've got this. Everyone take a deep breath. Maybe we could just watch TV. Spirit board, is anyone hearing us? I guess that's a no, huh? We have to make a figure eight motion. If we're all moving it, how does it work? Yes. Wow. What is your name? This is creepy. A. P. Hang on. R. I. Oh, fuck. L. This is sick, even for you. It's not me. Please stop. I should go. What's it like to be dead? L-O-N-E-L-Y. Lonely. She's lonely. All right, that's enough. I'm not doing it. Why are you lonely? Why are you dead? Fuck this, I'm out! She's just telling us the truth. Fuck you! Damn it. What the fuck was that? The truth hurts. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] [ELECTRIC BUZZING] Grr! [SCREAM] Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Um, I need to talk to you. Now. Can't you just pick me up? I have some, uh, leftover pizza in the back if you want it. Thanks. I'm good. Already had some. So, what's up? I had a bad run in with some of the girls. See, now it all makes sense. It's not why I called you. I don't need you coddling me. Well, at least there's that. Something weird is going on. I saw a guy at the party downtown, and he just-- he looked just like the guy. What guy? The guy from Halloween when I was a kid. You've gotta be kidding. No. I swear it's him. There's no doubt in my mind. You know, it could just be a coincidence. You know, you haven't seen the guy in a while, then all of a sudden, there he is. I don't know. Don't make me regret calling you. All right, all right. So-- so you saw him. I just-- I want to go check on the other girls, you know? I want to make sure they're OK. Well, give me an address. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are we really just gonna sit here and not talk about it? Talk about what? You're kidding me, right? I think we had a great night. I just wish Dave would show up. You went way too far. Why was she even here? Seems to me like you're fraternizing with the enemy. With the enemy? She's my friend. This isn't high school. You know what she did. April was my best friend, so she can bite it. I think she's hurt enough. I mean, we all walked away from her at the funeral. If you ask me, they both died that night. Maybe we could talk about it. No! I-- we're not going to talk about it. I'm done. You're killing my buzz. Let's just turn the TV on. So, it's election year. Right. Look at all these colorful signs in their yards. It's like a clown vomited all over them. Yeah. Hey, look, vote for Judge Cunts. It's Kuntz. Nope, it is most certainly Cunts. I heard it pronounced in the radio ads. It's Kuntz. Oh, yeah yeah yeah. So what's your favorite brand of Ketchup? Is it Hoonts? No, no, it's not Hoonts. It's Hunts. And they? They are Cunts. Well, they don't say it like that. Oh, no. It's how it's spelled, for sure. If anything, it's way more cunt than cunt. The K, the K, it's so much more deliberate. Oh, you're so childish. Said it yourself. I don't change, but you're the one grinning, so you're just as guilty as I am. [KNOCKING] She's not home. Something feels too weird. It's Halloween night. There's nothing weird about her not being home. I don't know, man. I think you're just worked up. Take a couple deep breaths. Don't fucking patronize me. I'm not, but you're obviously upset, and you're not thinking clearly. I'm not crazy. Hey, no one used that term. [KNOCKING] Fuck! We're out of wine. I brought enough for a lot more of us, so I think we got a little bit carried away. Why isn't he here yet? You dumped him. Maybe he went on a quest for his self respect and dignity. Yeah right. Well, we seem to be the only ones here. Is that a problem? No. Honestly, less cleanup. So I'm not too mean for your little party? I was afraid I'd offended the angel. You're totally tolerable most of the time. You know I love you like a sister. I know. Lucky. I even kind of love you like a cousin. Thanks. But you bitches have got to wise up. Oh, are you gonna lay some wisdom on us? No. Just trying to help. Great, thanks. I'm not mean. You guys just live in a bubble. You had a mom and dad that loved you. My dad died when I was 13. Let me finish. Your dad died. Mine abandoned me. He walked away. He chooses to be gone. OK. I'm just saying, life's not so easy for everyone. Oh, it is on! [LAUGHTER] [INTERPOSING VOICES] It's OK, there's no wine left. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] So, are you satisfied yet? I don't know. We've gone to four houses, and nobody was home. Sorry. I think you'd have a better chance of finding them if we went to the party. Downtown. Yeah, maybe. We could, um-- we could go down together? Scope it out? I don't know. You know, this may be a dick thing to say, but Halloween's for fun. Maybe you should try and enjoy it? Yeah, you're right. That was a dick thing to say. I didn't mean it like that. You just-- you've got to let go of the way you see this night. You're not being a dick. I'm just-- just not in the mood to hear it. So? What's the plan? I want to go back to Angela's. I'm pretty sure that was a total disaster. Yeah. But I want to be with them. You know, make sure they're all right. I can't argue with that. Where does she live? On the other side of town. Down by Elm. Oh, East Elm? West Elm. Well, let's get going. I knew you'd come. What the hell happened? I feel like shit. [INAUDIBLE]. What happened? This guy in a mask, he beat me! And he-- he told me something! What did he say? What did he say? He said-- Go on. I-- I'm scared. I-- I know you are, but let's get you untied. No! He said if you untie-- if you untie me, he'll kill us! Then what are we gonna do? He-- if you want out, you'll have to kill me. Oh, Jesus! [SOBBING] I don't wanna die! I-- I know you don't, and none of us will. Then what are we supposed to do? Well, we have to untie her. How? She's locked down! Do you have any car keys or something? Just where would I put them? Up my ass? I-- I have an idea. [KNOCKING] [SCREAM] He's waiting for us! Oh my God! Those girls in the pictures! Oh my God! They were real! They're dead! Why? Why would anybody do this to us? I don't-- This is a concrete basement with no windows. There's only one door, and there's a maniac behind it! Do you have an idea? No! What are we gonna do? Oh God. Oh my God! I just wish you'd open up a little. Hey, I called you, right? I needed your help. So all of me doesn't totally hate your guts. Well, I guess that's a start. Yeah, well, it's the best I can do. Are you sure you want to be here? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. This is probably a bad idea, right? I've got a feeling that no matter what I say, you're going to do whatever you want to do. So you weren't ignoring me the entire time we were dating? Nice. You talk to me like that, I'm going to start taking it personally. You know, I'm trying really hard to not hate your guts, but I'm just-- I'm used to it. It's like a big, warm fuzzy blanket that I just want to wrap myself up in. Well, it's a-- it's at least a start. Yeah. It's a start. See you later. Hold on a second. Do you want me to wait here? Why? If things go south, I could drive you home. Hey, I mean, I appreciate you helping me out, but if I walk into that house and everything goes bad again, I kind of just want to take a long walk home. Alone. OK? All right. But I'm just a phone call away. You know that, right? I know. Thanks. Happy Halloween. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh my God! [INAUDIBLE]. But I think our only chance is to do what they tell us. Are you kidding me? I need to save our lives. No, there has to be another way! Is there? Because I don't see it! Do you think I want to do this? Do you think I like this? No. I don't even know if we'll actually be let go. We know for sure that we're dead if we stay here. You've gone insane! I'm trying to save our lives, you fucking bitch! You're trying to kill our friend, and you call me a fucking bitch? Guys! Guys. If it has to happen, then do it. Arlene is right, and this may be our only way out. If-- if I have to-- if I have to die to save you both, then fine. [INAUDIBLE]. I'm so sorry. I just want you to know, I never hated you! Thank you. No, Lucky! Do it! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING AND CRYING] I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [SCREAMING AND CRYING] [KNOCKING] Come on. Whoa! Bianca. It's all right. God, you scared the fuck out of me. Tis the season. Yeah, well, I just wanted to, uh, see Angela. Join the party. Well, I mean, I just-- I just wanted to see Angela. It's getting pretty late. You know, I'd guess by now the girls are asleep. I stopped by earlier to check on them, and the wine was flowing pretty-- pretty easy. I guess they're out cold. Yeah, probably right. It's just, uh, it's been a rough night. For you and me both. I'm sorry. I-- I feel selfish. It's all right. You've always been a sweet girl. You know that. Really? Absolutely. Besides the attitude and the clothes, you're a good young woman. You always have been. Thanks. You know, it is getting late. Need a ride? No, no. Um, I think the walk and the air will do me good. It's pretty frigid out here. No, I mean, I really appreciate it, but, uh, I think I'll be all right. April loved you. What? You were her best friend. Halloween was always her favorite time of year. It just didn't go all that well all those years ago, but she sure loved going out with you. Thanks. One more thing. Yeah? You know, I'm really making a habit of sparing your life, little girl. What do you want? We did what you wanted. Why won't you just leave us go? Let her go! Let her go! [CHOKING] [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] Stop! It's OK! It's me! It's me. [SCREAMING] Well, that went pretty well, I think. You're just about ready to go. Go-- go where? Now, now, just relax, all right? [SCREAMING] Relax, all right? This is a lot better than tying you up all the time. Just relax. Make yourself comfortable. [SOBBING] You killed her! I killed all of them. Why? I don't understand! I love you, Angela. Don't you understand that? What? You are the most beautiful flower that I have ever watched blossom. You're special. You're out of your fucking mind! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, words just aren't going to work in this scenario. I am going to show you how much I care. Oh, God. By killing all my friends? Well, that was the beginning. I just wanted you to have a fresh start, that's all. Those girls were mean to you. They bogged you down. Now we can have a fresh start. I don't want to be with you! You're a sick fuck! I told you, I will show you how much I love you. You will come I love me in time. I'm going to show you that love is patience, Angela. Love is patience. You-- you [INAUDIBLE] killed people! Love also means never having to say you're sorry. I don't want to go with you! That isn't up to you! Get that through your mind! [SOBBING] We're just going to have a nice little ranch, just you and me and some chickens. And maybe a cow. They're gonna arrest you. They're gonna put you in jail. They have chickens and cows in Venezuela, too, you know. Oh God! I have a plan. Fuck. Don't want to get any of this in your cuts. Please don't do this. You think that after all this work, I'm going to be swayed by that? I have everything under control. You know, it sounds crazy now, but in a few years, you'll laugh at this story. How far I went to be with you. It's almost poetic, isn't it? Yes. Yes. [INAUDIBLE] All right, sweetheart. Time to get up. Come on. [GROAN] Damn! Angela! Fuck you, you sick bastard! [SCREAMING] It's-- all for you, sweetheart. All for you. Angela? The only thing more romantic than running away together is dying together. Don't do this! Oh, fuck! You gotta go! You gotta leave! (SOBBING) Angela! No, I have to get you out of here! --[INAUDIBLE] set the place on fire. No, no, no! Love is a bitch. I can't leave you like this! I can't leave you like this! No, no, go go go go! [SOBBING] It's not your fault. It's the second message I've left you Um, please call me back or something. I'm getting worried. What the hell? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! It's gonna be all right. No it's not! It's not! [SIRENS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
