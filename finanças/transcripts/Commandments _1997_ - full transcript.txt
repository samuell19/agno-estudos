HARRY: Personally speaking, I don't believe in God. I never had much use for Him. Believe too much in any one thing, God especially, and you stop seeing the world the way it really is. That's a problem. My brother-in-law Seth had that problem. When his life took a series of tragic turns, he knew exactly who to complain to. I need some reason! It just wasn't healthy. WOMAN: Yes. I need to speak to Mrs. Luce. It's an emergency, please. (SETH SCREAMING) MAN 1: They just seem innocent. MAN 2: But they're not. They're criminals. Yes, criminals. WOMAN: Okay, let me get this straight. Mr. and Mrs. Mann go to their ATM and withdraw $40 out of a $534 savings account and find to their surprise a quarter of a million dollars on deposit? A computer glitch. You're lucky they didn't have a coronary. Gee, it wasn't their money. They knew that. That's why they withdrew it. Excuse me. Yes? Sorry, there's a telephone call for you. An emergency. Excuse me. Hello? WOMAN: Hello, uh, Mrs. Luce? Yes. This is Sylvia Andrew. I was a friend of your sister, God rest her soul, when she lived on Broad Street. Yes. How are you? It's your sister's husband, Mr. Warner. He's on the roof screaming like a Zulu. Seth, Seth Warner? I think he's going to jump. (WOMAN MOANING) (MAN GRUNTING) (HARRY GRUNTS) (BOTH GASPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello. Hi, it's me. Hi, honey. Where are you? Uh, Brooklyn. What are you doing there? Uh, I'm interviewing Melissa Murphy. Who? Melissa Murphy, uh, the girl in the, uh, housing protection scam. All right, Harry, listen. I need you to do something for me that's very important. Uh, Seth is on top of a roof downtown, and he's... He's upset. What, Seth Warner, so what? He might jump. Uh-huh. I think you should go down there and prevent him from jumping. Oh. Why? (SETH SCREAMING) What a putz. Seth? Seth! Hey, Seth! What the hell are you doing? Get away from there! Well, it can't be that bad. It's never as bad as you think, right? Hey! Hey, can we talk about this? I curse the day I was born. I want an answer. Geez! (WAILING) Do you hear me? You had an accident. You're in an ambulance. Can you tell me your name? What do you remember? What's the last thing you remember? (GULLS CAWING) (KAREN CHUCKLING) SETH: Karen, you're such a tease. I'm shy. Yeah. Hear anything? No, not yet. You still gonna think I'm beautiful when I'm huge? You betcha. Whale-esque? The bigger the better. If your pupils dilate, I'll know you're lying. Am I the only one you'll every love? Yes. Better be. Hey! No fair. Karen! Karen! Karen! HARRY: It wasn't like I didn't feel sorry for him. I really did. I liked Karen. I liked her a lot. But after she disappeared, Seth snapped. He spent weeks locked up in his house praying. I guess he prayed for understanding, for, I don't know, some, some sort of sign. (DOG WHINING) (CLATTERING) (DOG BARKING) (CRASHING) He did not take it well. Not at all. I mean, he tried to snap out of it. He even tried going back to work. But it didn't help. There you go, Jasmine. See, that wasn't so bad, huh? Want a lollipop? Yeah? Okay. I heard about your house. Are you all right? Physically, not a scratch. (SIGHS) Thank God. You know, at least you got your health. Mmm. And health is important. It's very important. I'm... It is the important thing, health. Are you all right, Dick? I... I... I have some news. What? You're fired. (CHUCKLES) What? You're fired. What are you talking about? You're fired. I don't understand. Why? I don't know! Wait a minute! You tell me why! I... Me, I'm, uh, my heart, it's... (BELL RINGING) I don't know, it's hardened. Hardened? Yes, hardened. I mean, I, I can't explain it. I'm sorry. It's a hardened heart. I gotta go. HARRY: It all made him so paranoid, you would have thought that he worked for the postal service. So his ending up in the hospital wasn't exactly a surprise. But you would have thought the lightning would have taught him a lesson. (GASPS) Uh-uh, no way, he was a mad man. Worse, a mad man with a plan. Hey, how you feeling? You remember playing Mr. Light Bulb? Man, you were lucky. Lucky? Yeah, as in three feet from barbecue. Oh. Uh, Rachel's gonna pick up your dad from the bus station. They should be here in a few minutes. My dad? What did you tell my dad? Nothing. Uh, look, Seth, Karen's death was tragic, but there's no percentage in going UFO about it. I mean, shit happens. Shit happens? Well, yeah. The universe explained in two words. That's very impressive, Harry. You know, you should try reading The Tribune for a week. Chock-full of personal tragedies. Major disasters, minor disasters, karma, luck, fate, kismet, call it what you want. I don't know how to get this through to you, but this is more than that. Oh, please. I am not crazy! I know the difference between bad luck and a divine hand. Harry, if your shoelace breaks once, fine. Twice, tough. Three times, hell, change the brand. (AGGRESSIVELY) But if your shoelace breaks every day for two years, (WHISPERING) it's time to check your Bible. This has intent. I am being tested. Why? Why? I don't know. When I humbly ask, I get tortured. And let me tell you something. If the great God above is of such a vindictive nature, then I will defy him until the day I die. I'm just gonna go and check and see if Rachel and your dad are here. And then what does he do? He kills my dog. Ooh, I forgot to tell you. Sparky survived. He did? Yeah. Well, sorta. He lost a leg. He, uh, has a dead leg. That's exactly... Ah! Damn it! That's exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a god takes a dog's leg? Just take it easy, will you? All right. You know what? Okay, that's fine. As far as I'm concerned, that's it. The covenant is history! What covenant? The Commandments. The Ten Commandments? Yes, the Ten Commandments! You're gonna break the Commandments? You're damn right. I am gonna break every last one of them until I get an answer. The guy in 4B needs Thorazine. Talk to the doctor. Hi. Hi. How is he? Oh, fine, fine. Uh, he's, uh, right around the comer. 4B. Just to the left. What? I wouldn't go in there, if I were you. I thought you said he was fine. Oh, physically. I'm bringing you back to New Paltz. You'll heal. And on the Sabbath, we'll go to temple. You know, that rabbi still talks about your voice. How beautiful. Dad, I'm not going to any temple. All right. Fine. Okay. Well, then maybe you could go to your mother's old church. That priest, uh, what's his name? He's retired. Now they got this new young guy. He's very dynamic... Dad! No church, no temple, same thing. Ya-hoo and I are not getting along. Do you think I've done something terrible to deserve all this? Do you? No, no, no, no, no, no. Do you think I've done something terrible to deserve all this? No, no, no, but who knows the way of the Lord? I have a theory. He's a raging psychotic. HARRY: Okay, he had some problems. But what were we gonna do? He had no place to go. We had to take him in. Rachel insisted. Not that I was unhappy about it. No, I had a warm glow all over. A nice fuzzy feeling of goodwill. Seth, let me show you where you can sleep. I'm putting him in your study. Oh, okay. Thanks. Here, Sparky, come on. (SPARKY BARKING) (GUITAR STRINGS PLUCKING) It's a '56 Gibson L.P. Custom. Jeff Beck used to own it. It's very rare. Very expensive. Very, very expensive. Okay. Don't touch it again. Come on. Come on, furry. Good dog. Yeah. Easy, easy. (GROWLING SOFTLY) Rachel has this soft heart. Lost kittens, starving children, you know, crap like that. And I, I think it's nice. I mean, people should be concerned for the world that they live in. And we're very happy that you're staying with us. Oh. Just try not to over do it. Good night, Seth. Morning. Good morning. Wow, you shaved. Ah! Geez. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I shaved. Yeah, you look great. Oh, thank you. So do you. Wow. Thank you. Here you go. Sure. What are you writing? Oh, it's just a list. I'm trying to reorganize my life, get some things done. Sounds good. Mmm. So how are you? Good. You still doing law? Oh, yeah. Still the defender of the rich and greedy. HARRY: Jesus! I'm late. I gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go. Bye, honey. Bye. I'm gonna be home late. Nice shave, Seth. Oh, I used your razor. I know! (DOOR SLAMMING) I think I annoy him. No, don't take it personally. Everything annoys him these days. No, no, no, I think I seriously annoy him. You know, I mean, Harry and I have never really... Oh, that's not true. (SETH CHUCKLES) What about those Thanksgivings on the Cape? And they were, they were great. Yeah, lots of alcohol. I miss her. Yeah, I miss her, too. How are you, Harry? Hey, how ya doin'? Good, good. Never better. What can I do for you this morning? Well, there's somebody that would like to speak with you. Gee, I wonder who it is. Hey, thanks for the ride. Yeah, okay. Top of the morning to you, Chief. The shit they print in these rags today. Moral turpitude. Ah, it's appalling. Say, listen, uh, any comment on your relationship with Melissa Murphy and the misuse of the Witness Protection housing? No comment. Oh, that's too bad. But, uh, off the record, uh, what if I said I made some mistakes, you know? Made these mistakes because of my strong feelings for Miss Murphy. It's what's called being human. Not good, not bad, human. You understand me? Well, you know, we at The Tribune are always interested in human behavior. Hold anything sacred, Luce? You know, a man's honor, a man's career, a man's family. Not really. Well, you gotta be concerned about parking tickets. Parking tickets? Jaywalking. Spitting, too. Do you know how often the normal citizen runs afoul of the law? Once a year. Every 28 minutes. No shit. And believe me when I tell you this, you better never run afoul of me. Yeah, well, I'll take that under advisement, Chief. Yeah, do that. Toodle-oo. I wanna get something on that son of a bitch. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. Melissa Murphy. Gimme, gimme, gimme. It's late. It's late. Don't say that. Please, don't say that. Monday. I'll have it Monday. You trying to get us both fired? Mr. Jones has a hard-on for this story. I'm sorry. My wife made me go and help a friend that had suicidal tendencies, okay. A jumper. You did a good deed? Hey, I'm capable. Did he die? No, he lived. But he did say he was gonna break the Commandments. Is that news? Depends on how many he breaks. The misdemeanors? Living section, back pages, at best. Felonies? Front page, bottom right. Really? Absolutely, you got the Trinity. Death, sex and God. Well, we should be more supportive of my friend's religious convictions. Just get me the damn Murphy story by Monday. Okay. What's the first one? Uh, First Commandment? "Thou shall have no other gods." Oh, yeah, that one. "By the blood of Christ. By Christ's foot. "By Christ all bleeding mighty. By Jove. By Jehovah. "By cock." Shh! This is a library. I'm sorry. I have a job to do here, "By cocky." Shh! Don't talk like that in here. "By cockis. "By God. By Gad. By Gee, Gock." Eddie. Eddie. Damn Yahweh. Hi. Hey. What are you doing? I'm carving an idol of the goddess Kali. Who's Kali? She symbolizes death, terror, destruction, on the outside, but love, compassion and rebirth on the inside. Well, you can't really tell, but this, see this necklace. It's gonna be a necklace of human skulls and in each hand she's gonna be holding a severed head. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. Harry, do you know that Seth is carving a naked woman with skulls and severed heads? Mm-hmm. It's the Second Commandment. No false idols or graven images. And you don't think that's a problem? No, I think it's cathartic. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. He's gonna see his father this weekend. Is that good? Remember there is good in all the woes that come upon us, because evil cannot proceed from God. Seth... ...will you come up and sing the Shema? Please. Please, go. Please, Go, Seth. Please. Um, I have a question to put to the congregation if you don't mind, Rabbi. Is God willing to prevent evil, but just not able? Then he can't be omnipotent, right? Or is he able, but not willing? Then he must be malevolent. Or is he neither able nor willing? In which case, why do we call him God? Why indeed? Why? In fact, you know what? To hell with God. (ALL GASPING) Shame! Shame on you! Seth, what's going on? I don't understand you! Why? What are you doing? What is going on? Talk to me! Seth! Seth! MAN: Let him go. Let him go. (PHONE RINGING) Harry, could you get that? Ow. (RINGING CONTINUES) Hello? MELISSA: Is Harry there? Yes. Whom shall I say is calling? (STRUMMING) Harry. It's for you. Hello? (CLEARS THROAT) How'd you get this number? No matter. Yep. No. Okay, bye. That was Melissa Murphy. You know, I'm... I'm interviewing her for the Police Chief housing scam story. She just wanted to change an interview time. You wouldn't be having an affair with this woman, would you? Don't be ridiculous. You're not looking at me. (CLEARS THROAT) I am not fucking Melissa Murphy. (SOFTLY) Not anymore. (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Watch where you're going! (SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) Hey, I'm supposed to meet a guy here. Serious, dark, tormented type. You seen him? You just missed him. Ah, shit. What the hell, give me a double Irish. Sure. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Sparky? Hey, Sparky. Hi. Hey. Are you all right? I think he's cheating on me. Oh, no. Really? I'm sorry. Oh, don't be sorry. No, I don't... This is really silly of me. Oh, I feel like such an idiot. The bastard! And he lies about it, too. Are you sure? He comes home from work and he immediately takes a shower. The phone bill has phone numbers on it that I've never seen before. And he always has that guilty look on his face. What did he say when you confronted him? He denies everything, of course. He gets all high and mighty. The righteous scum. Why do I stay with him? I don't know. (SIGHS) I bet you never cheated on Karen. Rachel. Karen! Karen! (GASPS) Shit! What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Where were you? You stood me up. No, no, no, no. I was there. You stood me up. Yeah. Well, how was slamming daddy? Was that fun? No, it wasn't fun. It was difficult. Oh, you poor baby. Huh. Listen, Harry, when I got back here, your wife was in tears. Now, she's a good woman. You ought to try and treat her a little bit better. Who the fuck died and made you the marriage guru? Just trying to give you some advice to save your marriage. Oh, advice from an insane man. That's terrific. You could do worse than listening to me. Worse than a guy who fucked up so bad he's being punished by God? You're drunk. Go to bed. Wreck your marriage. Do whatever the hell you want, Harry. Or what? I'll be punished for my misdeeds? You should be. Really? Yeah, really. Well, let me tell you somethin', pal. I break five to six Commandments every day before lunch. And you know what? I got a beautiful wife. I got a great job, and a nice apartment. See this jacket? Fetal goat skin. It's the best. Only the best. And what do you got? Nothing. A stinking dead wife, a crippled dog, a God that hates you, and a fucking plan out of The Exorcist that you're too much of a pussy to stick to. Here. Go break some important Commandments, and then come and lecture me about my morals. Dick head. RACHEL: So, you knew when your bank account showed $250,000 on April 2nd that the money was not yours? Of course. Yes. You knew it was the bank's? Uh, no. Okay, if it wasn't yours and it wasn't the bank's, whose did you think it was? We didn't think about it like that. We thought the money was put there for a purpose. By who? God. Well. Mr. and Mrs. Mann are very religious people. Very. Yes, well, so is the Pope. But even he and the Lord don't have joint checking. We were surprised, too. We certainly were. Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Mann, Mr. Neer, l think that I can convince my client, the bank, not to press charges as long as you return the money. And I'll even try to get them to waive the interest. All in all, I think that's a very good deal. Look, I'm afraid that's not possible. They no longer have the money. You spent $250,000? No, of course not. Though, uh, I did get a nifty set of power tools. Okay. Where is it? In the garage. No, no, no. The money. I'm talking about the money. We gave it away. To charity. The Cetacean Society. You know, save the whales. MAN: Uh, is, uh, Rachel Luce in? WOMAN: I'm sorry, but she's in a meeting right now. Would you like to wait? All right, let's take a break. You know, every time I look at them, l... It makes me want to cry. Not because they're old and crazy, which they are. But because they're, they're so strong. They're so sure of their place in the world. I don't know how they do it. I feel so adrift right now. Well, with good reason. I mean, come on, what with Harry and all that. You know, Harry cares more about his stupid guitars than he does for me. You know what you ought to do? Is gather his guitars together and just throw them out in the street. Throw 'em out. Give him a chance to focus on what he should be focusing on... Which is you. I'd sure like to. I'd like to smash them to bits. I mean, he's gotta just wake up. Yeah, but you know, it's not really... It's not all Harry's fault. I haven't really... Well, I've been... I've been running from everything ever since Karen. It's really hard. I know. Hey... Do you remember this? Yes, this is Karen's. She said that was her window into an unseen world. Yeah. I can see the sea. It was your blue eyes. (RINGS DOORBELL) Hello, you... Hey. Watch it. Let's go inside, huh? Let's go in. So, uh, how many times a week would you see the Chief? Three, sometimes four. He was very thoughtful. We talked on the phone a lot. How often on the phone? Every day. Sometimes twice a day. Did, uh... Did he tell you that this, this, this house was owned by the government? We called it our little safe house, where all is permitted. Hmm. I'm getting a certain vibe here. Look, uh, things are getting a little complicated. Can we, uh, just get on with the interview? Do we have to? Yes. Did the, uh, the Chief give you any, uh, any gifts? Sure. What? It's engraved, to Buttercup. Could you point that in the other direction? This little thing? Yes. Take off your clothes. Look, Melissa, if you think that this triggers some kinky sexual fantasy of mine... Not your fantasy, sweetie. Mine. (CLICKS) Uh-huh. Next. Can I help you? Yeah. I can't live with the guilt any longer. I'm here to confess a crime. Rachel. Rachel, honey. Seth. (WHISTLING) My guitars. Hi, Harry. I'm in here. We've been burgled. What? What'd they take? They took my guitars. Oh, my God. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. Broke in through the bathroom window. Oh, that's so weird. Oh, I'm so sorry. They only took the guitars? Yes. They obviously knew what they were doing. Expensive, easy to fence. You know, I called the insurance company and made a claim. It just makes me sick. Wow, gosh, I'm really sorry. Let me get you a drink. Thanks, honey. Okay. All right. (SOFTLY) Yes! You know, you'd think they'd take the goddamn computer or something. Rachel, do you know where Seth is? All right, here's the story. Harry Luce, that's my brother-in-law. Melissa Murphy, that's his mistress, and myself conspired to commit this crime. What happened was I took Harry's guitar collection, very rare, very, very expensive, made it look like a robbery and I stashed 'em in Melissa Murphy's basement, see? And the idea was we were all gonna split the insurance money three ways. Look, I got all that, but, uh, why you confessing? Because stealing is wrong. Did you ever hear of the Eighth Commandment, "Thou shall not steal?" All right. Do you mind, uh, putting that down in writing? No, not at all. No problem. Is he telling the truth? MALHONEY: Why would he lie? Does it check? So far so good. We're working on it. We're gonna need a warrant. Well, get the warrant. Get him on video. Get him immunity. Get him any fucking thing he wants. And get busy! Yes, sir. (SIGHS) Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Melissa Murphy? Yeah. There's a warrant to search the premises. You can tell that limp dick, fat, pinky haired boss of yours that if this is his way of expressing his feelings for me then he is fucking pathetic! Hello, Lucille. Hey, what? What, did I forget to give a donation to the police benefit? Let's go. Hey! Transport, call it in. Warren! Warren! You are demented, Warren. Did you know that? You ever heard of the First Amendment? Freedom of the press? When the Tribune gets done with you, you are gonna be cleaning toilets in Bed-Stuy! You're gonna be sweeping the streets of East New York! Am I getting through to you, you demented Mick? Demented, huh? Let me show you something, Luce. What? (VOCALIZING) Are you ready? For what? You deserve a day on the town. Where did you get those clothes? What do you think? I think you look unbelievably great. That too much? No. So you're going to come out with me? Um, yeah, I'd love to. False witness. You never heard of false witness? That wacko is throwing the damn Commandments at me! Calm down. We should have you out on bail by tonight. Do you want me to call Rachel? No, no, no, no. She'll cast me and Melissa as Bonnie and Clyde. She already thinks I'm having an affair with her. Are you? What has that got to do with anything? You listen to me. There is a wacko, fucking, crazy bastard out there on the loose, unhindered, coveting! The fiend. I'm serious. Thou shall not kill. What about that? You're right. Oh, I know I'm right. For the record, if you were to be murdered, how would that make you feel? You get me outta here! Just a short quote. Get me outta here! Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, yeah. It's a mango something. Oh, yeah. My, the... The water looks so strange today, doesn't it? Oh, you know what's that from? Hmm? That's from that hurricane down South. Really? Uh-huh. See what happens in a storm like that is it pushes the clouds so high they become ice crystals, and then they act like prisms and they refract the light in a strange way. Think it's gonna hit New York? I don't know. If it wants to. Does it want to? It's not really proper to ask a hurricane its desires. Well, we don't want to be improper. Do we? Bullshit. Where the hell you been? Is this gonna take all night? Could. Oh, that's just great. And I have to tell you there's this other problem. (SIGHS) What? You're fired. MAN: Court's in recess for one hour. What? Mr. Jones thinks you lost us the Murphy story, cause you couldn't keep your dick in your pants. I tried to tell him it was more complicated than that, but he... Let's go, pal. Now, come on. Don't you... Hey, get, get... Watch the coat, will you? Shut your mouth. Let's go. Tell that bastard I quit. Sorry. (SETH LAUGHS) It doesn't work for me. There's a little logic to it. There's a little bone there, and then... There you got it. I got it. You got it. It's amazing. How did you do that? I have no... But see how far I can... No, don't touch me. Hey, where you going? Where's the door? Oh, my God. Bravo. How did you do that? You have great balance. What about grace? What about temptation? What? I'm sorry. What if what I'm feeling is all because you, you loved my sister, you know, and I'm attracted to you because some sort of perverse connection between you, me and her? An ex-girlfriend is bad enough, but, uh, a deceased sister. I mean, how can I measure up to that? Come here. Come here. So is the real reason that we're holding each other like this just one big mix-up of transferred feelings? Absolutely not. Good. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? I have another question. What? Am I a Commandment to be broken? Yes. Is that all I am? No. You are so much more it scares me. Who is this motherfucker? Hey, babe, it's me. Uh, listen, um, I'm stuck up in Woodstock following a lead. Uh, it's not my fault. We're all innocent up here at Woodstock. HARRY: Would you shut up? Yeah, uh, I'll be home tomorrow. And listen, uh, look out for Seth. His, uh, Commandments are getting personal. Hey, yo, cupcake, you done with the phone? You guys think you're pretty funny, right? Your turn. (SCREAMING) Knock it off! Put the gun down, man! (MOANING) Oh, my sweet Lord. Where the hell is he? Who? That snake, that double-crossing viper, that creeping religious freak! Seth, who else? He must have gone out. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. Eh, it's not your fault. It's not? No, you're just too innocent that's all. I am? Yeah. I mean, you take a guy in, you take him in, you treat him like family, like a human being, and what happens? You get fired, you get robbed, you get beaten! Harry, what's going on? Look, I'll explain it to you later. Just keep the door closed. I think he's dangerous. Oh, Seth's not dangerous. Trust me, you don't know him in the Biblical sense. I don't? We've had many reports of low-lying areas underwater. Hurricane warnings continue in effect from Cape May to Eastport Maine. The latest radar is showing torrential rain through the upper valley down to Long Island. (MUSIC BLARING) Hey, hey, how good of you to join us. Seth. Yeah? Wait. Seth. Frank. Seth. Yeah? You and I need to talk. Come on. Oh, yeah. Hey, this is my jacket. Yeah. It's coveted fetal goatskin. It's smooth. It's only the best. You are upsetting me. You know that, Seth? You are really upsetting me! You moron! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) Harry, I, I just want to say, I got a lot to thank you for. Oh, yeah. Things are looking up. You are nuts. Let's go. I'm taking you to the police, 'cause I want my guitars back! All right. Come on, Harry, have a drink. Why don't you just have a drink? Oh, give me that. What? This? Just give me that. You want this? You want this? Who? Who? Number seven adultery, who? Who? Harry, please. I'm a gentleman. I'm warning you. Who? Hmm? Get outta here. Rachel would never sleep with someone as inconsequential as you. Whatever you say, Harry. You are demented, you know that? You are demented! You are deranged. Your whole life has been delusional. It always has been! Like you fell from the sky with the angels. You want to know something else? Karen was no angel. I fucked her. Harry, she didn't even like you. Well, that's why she did it. She wanted a dirty fuck. I guess she just got tired of her pussy-whipped husband. You better shut your face. I bent her over the couch and I banged her. She loved it. I'd still be banging her now, if you'd kept your eye on her at the beach. Fuck you. (GROANS) If I even think you touched Rachel, I'll kill you. Thou shall not kill, Harry. (CLANGING) You fucking liar! You adulteress! Yeah, only after you slept with her. You mean it's true? Yeah. Why was I arrested? How could you sleep with Seth? You've got no taste. You dare talk taste? Why was I in prison? You slept with a freak! He's a mental freak! What's next? Midgets? Dwarves? At least Seth is clean. I'm clean. BOTH: Shut up! I thought that we agreed that he was the enemy here. Hey, hey, hey, I'm the victim here. You? Have you ever seen a toilet in a woman's correctional facility? Let me tell you, it is a stinking hole! Where the hell do you think I was? The Plaza? Oh, this makes me so sick. Come here. Get out. Oh. Look, I know you're really upset right now, but I'll fix everything with the police. I swear. Right now, I gotta be alone with my wife. (WHISPERING) She is a bitch, Harry. A bitch. Yeah, come on. Just in here. That's good. I will not be left twisting in the wind. I have resources. Yeah, I know you do. But... Bye. (DOOR LOCKS) Oh, shit. Rachel. Rachel! (BANGING ON DOOR) Rachel, open the door. We need to talk. No, I don't want to talk. I just want to be alone. Look, we can't solve anything with a door between us. I love you. Where do you want me to go? Oh, look, you might find it interesting to know that Seth is trying to kill me. I find that admirable. Oh, really? Really? Fine, fine. Then we can both be victims of this stupid plan of his. Don't you get it? Don't you understand? It's a game to him. He's crazy. He doesn't love you. You're some piece of tail that he can check off a list! Open the damn door! Rachel. (SOFTLY) No. (DOG WHINING) ...Hurricane Abe. We do have new conditions for you. It appears likely that Abe will miss New York City making landfall to the northeast near Montauk. Our striped forecast shows the highest probability of landfall in the red. Winds farther to the north, of course, will be picking up as the hurricane heads towards New England. The winds have been increasing in speed, rising from 120 miles per hour to 140 miles per hour. Taking a look at a different perspective from our satellite shot, we can clearly see the structure of this powerful storm system. In the center is the eye of the hurricane. (NEWSCASTER SPEAKING DISTORTEDLY) (STATIC) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Hey. Hey. Hey. (SIGHS) Oh, I missed you. I missed, missed you, too. Rachel, I'm just... What? I am so confused. I know. I threw Harry out. You did? Uh-huh. Wow. I have to go away. Why? It's kinda hard to explain, but I had a... A sort of, I don't know what. No, wait. Where do you have to go? Montauk. (CHUCKLES) Well, that's hardly the end of the world. How long you going for? I'm not sure I'm coming back. You're moving to Montauk? I can't see you anymore. What? Look, look, try to understand this. Everything I have ever loved has been taken from me. I've fallen in love with you. I'm scared to death what's gonna happen to you. Oh, wait a minute. You love me. Therefore, you have to go to Montauk? Well, yeah, sort of, that's it. 'Cause why? You think that, that God... Yes, God. Will what? Will kill me? Yes. What is it with you men? This is driving me crazy! Are these my choices? Seth, this it? This is what I get? A philandering asshole or a sanctimonious lunatic? Now, what in God's name is the matter with you? I don't know, It's just... I know it's not entirely of my own doing. I don't know. What? A higher purpose allows you to hurt me, is that it? God pisses on you, so you piss on everyone else. Rachel, you're better off without me. Stop it! I can't stop it. And I'm so sorry. Hey, Frank, give me an Irish. Make it the good stuff. I'm dying here. Sure. Hey, listen, uh, you seen Seth? Yeah, yeah, he was in. When? About an hour ago. Did he say anything? Say where he was going? No, he just, uh, had a pop, uh, read the paper, nothing. (WOMAN MOANING) (MAN MOANING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WIND HOWLING) NEER: We have to finish this deposition and, uh, then you have to counter offer that the bank cares to present so we can get Mr. and Mrs. Mann back to New Jersey before the weather turns bad. Mrs. Luce? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know where my mind is today. In the clouds. Probably. I'm sorry. It's all right, dear. It's all right. (THUNDER RUMBLING) I'm gonna blow your fucking head off. Go ahead, do it. At this point, you're just doing me a favor. Go ahead. Go ahead. Want to know the difference between you and me, Harry? I'm at the point where I could kill somebody. You, me, it wouldn't matter. Oh, give it up Seth! You make a piss poor antichrist. Ah, fuck! What the fuck are you doing? I didn't shoot you! Answer me this one question. What? Why does God the all-powerful allow pointless suffering? Is there a time limit? I don't know! I don't know! That's not good enough. Because the bastard ain't just, all right. I mean any pair of eyes can see that. Powerful? I mean if he could create the whole universe shit yes. But it doesn't take a genius to figure out with just a dust ball in the corner of the house that he doesn't give a shit about house cleaning. (BREATHING HEAVILY) What do you believe in? I don't know. (GUN CLATTERS) (SIGHING) Seth! Seth! Seth! (SCREAMING) Yes? Who are you? Who are you? I live here. Then why were you ringing? Is Rachel in? She's sick. What's wrong with her? A touch nauseous. Would you tell her that her husband is at the door? She wants to know what you want. What the hell is going on in there? Pinochle. Tell her I want to talk. I'll pass it on. Oh, my God. Hi. Hi. You can come in. Who are they? Friends. I had sort of a little breakdown. They've been very kind. Seth's dead. How? He murdered himself. Jumped into the sea off Montauk Point. Look, Rachel, I don't want to be alone. I want to come home. No, it's not going to work. I can change. You don't understand. I'm a changed man. Why? I don't want you back. You gotta give me a reason. That's not a reason. I deserve a reason. Because I'm pregnant. What? It's not yours, and I'm gonna have it. But how could you know? I know. I just know. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, my God! What is that? Oh, my God! (GASPS) (GASPS) Okay. All right. Let's give me your arm. Why don't, why don't we get back down, all right? I feel okay. What? Okay let's head on out. HARRY: How do you explain a miracle in a world that can explain most everything? Maybe it's an emotion so pure, it can freeze time. Maybe, it's a man stripped bare of all he was seeing the world new again. Yeah, sure but what about me? I'm alone. (SPARKY WHINES) Oh, yeah, I get the dog, but basically I'm alone. Do I hate Seth? Well, yeah. But then again, I'm not sure it was all his fault. What if it was fate? I mean, how do you fight that? What do you fight it with? Heart, faith, soul? Ah, then how the hell would I know? I don't believe in fairy tales. But I do know that what I don't know might be a whole lot bigger than I thought. (SHOUTING) Well?
