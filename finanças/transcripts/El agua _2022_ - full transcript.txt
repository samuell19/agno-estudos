In summer there are no oranges. - I'm more from here than the host. - And you eat an orange. Also, oranges now all year round. What happens is that it is bad. What a coincidence! That's not his scent. - It doesn't itch either. Come on man. Could you give me a cigarette? Of course I do, Moorish queen. I give you whatever you want. Oops!

That's why he's full of shit. Shut up, shut up. Do not start. -Be quiet. I don't see it as a joke. Gross. My grandmother always tells me that when I was little, a girl from the village He disappeared and it began to rain heavily. And they spent a whole week without being able to leave the house, no light, no water. And they never heard from the girl again. - You are crazy? - Be quiet. I swear I'm going to stay eating roof. Those things piss me off. I believe them. Are you an asshole or what? What are you doing here? I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm old enough to piss alone. I don't need a watchman. It was in case you got lost.

That I nothing Where have you been? Ana? I go inside, the bar is alone and people are waiting. What a scratch we got. Yeah, I don't know who it's out with. Well, I don't know, but not you. Leave it, if you do not see that it is for quality. That she has linked! Goes, see? The arrival of a new cold drop is confirmed, about 500 liters per square meter that can fall, according to the neighbors. In any case, experts say that we cannot trust of this weather forecast model because it is one of many. It is not clear when or how it will rain, but you have to prepare. It seems that the water is coming, grandmother. I know, daughter. Last night the air was filled with that smell of sulfur. the water comes because the river falls in love. And he falls in love with a woman. And since he can't get her, he drags her away. Down with her, down with him. My grandmother told me when I was little. We were in her room in her bed, enormous, and she told me that... there is something that gets inside the woman that is water. And I asked him how he is going to get inside you and he said that if he falls in love with you, he gets involved. And I told him how can that be. "If she gets into you, you'll know." Yes, precious. You are, you are She takes a gift. Treasure. I eat it. Look how cute. Ay ay ay. Sit down. Yes because... Why are you bitter? She is crying all day. I don't know what to do with it. He hardly eats, he does nothing but cry. The pediatrician told me that they are streaks, that nothing happens. But he doesn't gain weight or anything and he's crying all day. He hates me. Here you have. Thank you. The boy has an evil eye. Bring me the oil and salt. He's going to care. Non-stop, non-stop. Little thing. He is already. hmm? Very fast. Now you have it for a while and when you get home, You will see how he is calmer. what a thing I take it from you? So that the anger goes away and give me a joy to the body. You are breastfeeding. I've been ten months without drinking. That I am a mother, but I am a person. I'm telling you too. Yeah? Let her, don't be so... Well, nothing. You act like a nun. Nun, no. What, fat what? Yes. We have been closed. Ana, do you want a little? What's up, I don't like mistela. You do not want? It's more Cuban. What about you? Don't you say anything to your favorite aunt? Here I am spending the summer. Summer. She has gotten a boyfriend. Really, mom. Really, mom. He keeps going in and out. Do I remember your 17, sweetie? Needless. I tell you everything. Don't you remember what you were like at his age? Look at him, how comfortable he is with aunty. Grab it now. No, I kept it from you. I'll give it to you for a while. Leave me alone, that's it. If he has forgotten you, aunt. Not now. Baby girl there it is. I'm going to put this, let's see. It seems that... That's it. Come eat. Like this all day. You see it? It's not hooked. She gets hooked, she lets go. Come on! Give me a cigarette, Ahmed. A cigar? Because of how well you do it? Give me a cigarette, host. Come on, take. - Let him smoke. - He's the boss's son. give it to him What an asshole. What bastards are they, huh? If you haven't worked And he looks how tired he is. The same as you. We've been all morning. You just came. Motherfucker! Oh! I have beaten you. What a pity not to stand. And this was drunk with some colleagues that they didn't have a tattoo machine and I said: "I want to get one". We went to another house of a colleague and we're done there... "But we do it in English." And in the end they put it wrong and everything. It's misspelled. I see now. And yours? Well, I did this one for my mother and this one, for my grandmother. When I did them, they told me off, but deep down they are proud. And this? Well, a scorpion for the story. A story? You don't know. No. I don't know. It is a scorpion that asks a frog to help you cross a river. The frog does not trust him, but in the end, Well, she ends up riding it on her back. And when they carry half a river, well, the scorpion stings it. The frog asks why she has bitten him. The scorpion answers that because he is like this, he cannot escape his fate. Host. And you are the scorpion, right? That is up to you. What character. Hey, and that scar? A war wound. Yes of course. Come on, man. Don't play mysterious. Yes, Julia. Look, come, give me your hand. Playing. But she touches it without fear. You're scare of it? Do you think I'm afraid of a scar? If you don't want to tell me, don't. I'm not afraid of that. I'm afraid of something else. What thing? See every day the same road. That does scare me. But, well, I don't want to talk about it. And how is the foreigner? The truth, motherfucker. And London the best he's got is that people go to their fucking ball and nobody pays attention to you. And there are people out there playing in the streets, there are a lot of parties. What I liked the most was on the river walk, at the end there is like a fair, with a piece of giant ferris wheel that they put lights at night and some colored spotlights and the city, the river, lights up. The truth is spectacular. And don't you feel down having come back? I do not know. I try not to think about it It's my turn to be here and that's it. There are people who say that you did not go abroad to work. That you made it all up. Yeah? And do you believe it? I do not care to. Total, whatever you do, They always find something to criticize you. Put your head here. Here? Yeah. do you hear? The fact that? groundwater. No, I don't hear anything. If you listen. focus. You don't hear like a... No, no, I can't hear anything. A stream of water passes through here. It's called an aquifer. Yeah? Yeah. I saw it on internet. And what did he tell you? Well that? I've heard them since I was little. Take it off now, seriously. You are there all day with the Savana in your head, the other is messing with Mar. She spoke to me the other day on Instagram and you there that you do not take it off. I've been talking to her all summer. The little messages of "I love you" and all this shit... Oh. I go to the guys, they are dumber. It seems that you do it on purpose. You need a good powder. Do you advise her now? Listen to me. Like you don't look for them on purpose. That José fucks well, he is the only thing I tell you. Let's see, we still fuck a little. I would like to repeat the dust with that of Tongue. With the Language? -Yes, in the fitting rooms. What are you saying? -And with my cousin. If she is 30 years older than you. And? focus. Yes, in the changing room of the Pool that was like... With the clothes she was trying on. What if this skirt suits me? And well, with those things I get hot. She's making it up. I swear, aunt. my goodness -With this she marries. - Did you know? You have to sing him that song that's like... So, so it is. # I already found what will be my future wife. # The mother of my three children, Sevillian, pretty and beautiful. # When dancing she seems that she flies. Her feet are pure gold. # Marry me, flamenco, what an eternal love I swear to you. # Oh, that she is in love. It is the final one! What final? She runs with the one 20 years older than you. do you get angry? Do you get angry? Yes, I get angry. Get angry, get angry. get angry I follow. See you. And they don't give it back. They keep the pigeons and the device. The problem is that they advance with the pigeon. - Buenas tardes. - Buenas tardes. Very good. Waiting to present the pigeons. What good males it brings. -That kills me. I like it now. Are there many so far? -At the moment we have 25 palomicos. Some people are missing. It's still early. Now the people will come and nothing. Let's take the registration. It's alright, huh? We have it under control. Don't run away Buenas tardes. One minute to shoot the pigeons. The pigeons of the release of Magaña de la E, fifty, 22, 77. Dove in the air and dove with dove. Come on. We go there. It's going to be your father's turn to invite you. Come on, let's go. The dove is falling. -Your pigeon is worth nothing. José, I found out that you flirted with the woman from the bar. Pedro, has your son fucked the woman from the bar? are you funny José, you don't waste time as soon as you arrive. Are we where we are? Brother, as he is the same as the mother, he's going to leave you drier than the mojama. What the fuck is going on? What are we up to, shit? We are watching the release. - Don't be angry, cousin. I'm telling you because if she's hot, we'll all fuck her. It's just that she's still going on, I shit on God. We are with the pigeon. Still there. Do not be angry. With the fucking assholes. I give you the information of the town. Information of what? What the fuck are you talking? In the end you get a fucking host. She is a crybaby. A crybaby Crying about what? I shit on God. I shit on your fucking mother. Come on, let's go. Jose, go This is not the time, please. - Your son is a crybaby. - Look, Ramon. The last one, huh? Don't fuck with me. Easy, man. -OK? No. You pass an egg. Fucking maniacs. He runs to comfort the princess. "Oh, Lord, let it be... whatever you want, but make it quick." And then your grandfather arrived with his shirt open and... that plaster chest he had and... that meat that I had never seen. AND... he covered me with kisses and... The thing is... the grandfather had to go to France the next day with the truck full of oranges and... "I don't want him to go alone." And we were doing it the whole time in the back of the truck. And I liked it. Come on, grandma. I soap your back that in the end you're going to make me red. But then things changed. Later, in marriage. And those hands... they were used for something else. Anyway. Well. God forgive me, but when he died, I rested. and to grandfather, Have you seen him since he died? Yes of course. The dead always stay with us. And I remember when my grandmother used to tell me, on summer nights, to go out to the door of the street to tell stories and to talk, that she told us the story of a girl from here in my town, that she was the most beautiful that... her when she was going to get married, she was already dressed as a bride... The girl was gorgeous, dark-haired, tall, black eyes, she wore a beautiful wedding dress, the white veil of her. She was spectacular. But suddenly, she began to have a strange feeling. She began to feel bad. That feeling of water inside, very nervous. The rain started. She started to go further. The girl started to run. She disappeared. People were looking for her for months. And no one knows what happened to her. And they say that those who lived that during that moment, during those days, they knew that there was something there. And they all knew it, but they didn't say it. But she was carried away by the water. The water was not going to consent to her getting married. She was his. She tried. But what's up? Hello. How are you? How are you? How are you? Brilliant. Come on. Do you know how I imagine you when you grow up? As? With some gray hair here. Such a line going down. The wrinkle on the forehead. Well. Also wrinkles around the eyes, around here. you're going too far The cheeks with more mola. Split lips. A little more chin. And always gorgeous. Do you want to know how I imagine you? As? Without beard. With the same shave. With the same smile. Living in a flat with two cats. You will have quit smoking. Sure. We'll see about that. You'll be a bit of a mess. But very happy. I'm missing one thing. What thing? You. Yeah? Won't you be? Don't know. What do you think? Yes. Yeah? Maybe yes, maybe no. I think so. I do want to. I want to be with you always. Always. Here do not throw because they are two. The two machine works differently. It is finer. I only do the three. -Nothing else. Equal. This is for two. You see it? Two wires. -OK. This is three. Three and here. This one too. Everyone on the beach doing what they want and we in the town died of disgust. If we all get a taxi together, We can go to Torrevieja one night, right? Or to the beach, because if not, what a summer. Maria, are you high? I... -Damn, the last one was missing. Where do we get the money for the taxi? From wherever. We'll have to hook up with someone with a car. And call more people, because the girl is horny and she goes through everything. What do you say, freak? You go through everything. Let's see, a little yes that is true. I'm not pissed off. How heavy. That you're not... Oh my gosh. - Well. - If that... You are going to freak out with what your horoscope says. - Let's see. - Look. I don't know how you don't believe the things I tell you and you swallow that bullshit about the horoscope. I don't understand. -Because it's not the same. The horoscope is an ancient science... Can you hear me? Yes, come on. Who studies the stars, the planets that studies a handful of people. An ancient science. Who studies the stars and planets. Don't believe it if you don't want to, but it helps me a lot. Besides, not only to know your future, which is to be more aware of the decisions you make. For my decision to tell Maria to do my nails. Please seriously. Well, rip them off. They are cool. Look at them better. Of choni, total. Oh really? Those nails are ugly. I can't stand them. See you later. I eat it! Aunt! -Yes aunt. - You bastard. - What's the matter? "I refuse." Well... the girl told me that she could see if she had water inside her. And if you have it, she takes it out with prayer. She's going to the pot. Well, I do not know. Same, but my grandmother won't stop talking about it, man. In my house, nobody pays any fucking attention to him. And every time my grandmother tells me something like that, she makes my body stand on end. The same. They don't pay any attention to my grandmother. But I love listening to it. my goodness If we continue like this, we will not leave this town. When I thought that all the shit of the floods happens because of her. They fill everything with shit, they fill everything with lumps. And the best, tell ghost stories. That's true, but be that as it may, I think the story of the river that falls in love is more beautiful. Do you think you're going to get away from me? No. Do not be angry. If I want, you will see my face until the day you die. Yeah? Yes. No matter how much you run and that you fuck others. And now that? Hey? Now what? Let's see if the spell... Let's see if I throw it to you. No, you can not. And who says that? That is so and that's it. Either you can or you can't. I tell you that I can. Yeah? Yes. I am a witch. Or have you not heard? You're a witch? Yeah. I hope nothing bad happens. Why is it going to happen? I don't know, don't listen to me. Everything good that happens to me lasts very little. Why do you have that shit in your head? I don't know. Lately I feel like I'm drowning. As if I lacked air. Here everyone drowns. Well let's get out of here. If you already did it, you can do it, right? Yeah. Someday we will go together. the night has been long and from Guardamar to Orihuela people measure river levels. In Orihuela the night waters poured in. Today they have dropped somewhat, but, in the absence of a better channel, Segura has opened up to its streets and squares and proudly reflects the old monuments. it rains inside And the news is still alarming. The worst has yet to come for this long-suffering Valencian region. Many only have to wait for help, airborne from the roofs of their houses. Helicopter pilots multiply. Lost by farmhouses and districts, there are 10,000 isolated people. Your only hope is in heaven. The land, their land, is already Segura's. Sorry, mom, I was with Elena and Virgi... ...and I'm late. We had not agreed on that. Damn, mom, it's summer. You said it. Summer for all. Do you hear me? Hey, you be careful. Because? Don't get hooked. First love leaves you shit. What do you know about love? Well look, I don't know much, but I do know what it's like to lose everything for someone. No no? It's not the same, because I'm not like you. Sorry. I shouldn't tell you these things. Do you know what's up? Even if it pisses you off We look alike more than you like. Oh mom, don't worry. Because I know very well what I'm doing. Go to sleep, go. Good night. Good night. Anyway, you don't understand anything. Yes Yes? I understand everything. You are the one who does not want to understand. I am also 17 years old. Oh yeah? Yeah. Seventeen years. For the 17. For the 17. I was going along the river bank and so was I, and I saw her coming in white. And I asked her what was wrong with her because she was crying and she says: "I don't know what's wrong with me or what's happened to me. I don't know where I am. I don't know na I don't know what I am." When it rains, I remember a lot about the bride that she took the river. And I always tell my daughter, when she starts to rain, she that she come to my house, She scares me and I don't want the river to take her away. I want her to be in my house to protect her from her. Yeah... If the river... If the water gets inside her, I do not care anymore. But she that she is in my house. Look, take these. Take her there. Come on, Jose. With a little desire. Are you dead or alive? Ok Jose Antonio. Let José do it himself. Let him learn. How's it going here? It is going well. Does he reach the top or not? - He's going there. - Manolo. How's it going there? What a shitty water they threw us out. And that we have to pay for it. OK. She's been here, Grandma. I promise she was like she was here. Tired? Yeah. Have a drink. Look, son. I'm not the one to tell you who you go in and out with. But that baby is not going to bring you anything good. Whoever enters that house ends up scalded. No good woman comes from there. She has always been like this. It's up to me and no one else. I already know it. But that you are focused is my business. I told you clearly. Once she opened the doors for you. But not two. Sometimes I think I'll open my eyes and you won't be here anymore. And I wonder if it is possible to have hot black water inside. If what they say about us is true or from repeating it so much we have ended up believing it. # I can't explain what happened. # I can only tell you that it didn't work. # It wasn't your fault, it was both of us. # For being so whimsical. # We hold on so tightly that we get tired. # One moment. Hello. Come on, come help me. Let's cut the artichokes. Take. Let's see. Get to peeling them. Come on. Someday, when I'm gone, who's going to do it? Grandma, don't start, you're not going to die. We all die, Ana. You will have to wake up and take over. I have to go. OK? But I'm not long. Do you prepare everything for the rice? That pretty. See you later. Do not take it into account, daughter. It's not that it happens to you. That's what, well... Today you need to give your body joy. Shall we smoke a cigarette? OK. That you don't smoke, grandma. With you. Grandmother. Is it true what they say about having the water inside? Everything is going to be fine. Hello isbael. Can you get me a drink? Long time no see. The usual, right? Yeah. Thank you. What do you want? I have come to ask you for help. Aid? Get your kid off my kid's head. Who do you think you are? I have nothing against her. Really. But I need you to focus. I don't want to spoil it. Finish that and air. Hello. Hello. Is everything alright. Goes up. Goes up. # The cat that is sad and blue # you never forget that you were mine. # But I know that he will know of my suffering # because in my eyes # there is a tear. # Dear dear, # my life. # Reflection of the moon that laughed. # If loving is closed, # my fault. # I loved you. # In the background # what is life. # Don't know. # The cat that is # in our sky. # We're going to have shots, come on. Give me six shots, please. - Aunt, what a rule. - Daughter. And more than he knows me. Why do we toast? For us. For us. Men! - I've gone too far, haven't I? - Gross! Can you give me fire? Yeah. And you, what are you? My mother's new friend? More or less. You are Ana, right? Yeah. And what have they come for? Here you come to do something or you don't come. I come to work. And what do you work? Water management. I am "witty". Well, I'm an expert. Very good. But I don't know why I ask you. If you will also go Haven't they told you that in this house we are cursed? Well no. I haven't heard anything. How odd. But why do people say that? Don't know. They've been saying it since I was little. But it's silly, isn't it? Could be. That? fuck it Fuck everyone. Well yes. Fuck everyone. When the water was drunk, she found herself that she was missing something, she had anxiety, and she understood that the river attracted her, attracted her, and always more each day. She went every day to visit the river because she was attracted to her. then she understood that there was someone who wanted her. Then she surrendered to the river. Because she had that strength that called her. And she surrendered to the river. And I want to notice it. I'd love to. They say it can be good or bad. But I do not care. I want to notice it. I want to know what it is and face it. I'd love to. When the river gets inside you, you have two options: or go with him so that there is no disaster and calm down, or stand up to him. And let it be what God wants. Hello good. How are you? Good. That I put you? A little bitch, please. Like your father? You tell me. Okay. There it goes. What are you doing here? Take me a carajillo. I stay. What do I owe you? I invite you. Thank you. It looks to be very bad. No Uncle. Of course. They are the best, for Zombies. Come on zombies. What else? Good stuff please. What do you fancy? Burgers. Burgers. Burgers. I want a strawberry. For one that I like. A strawberry. This is good? Yes. Better than nothing. Where do you see the 50? Come on, let's go. Alright. What's happening? Come, let's go in. # You looked me in the eye. # Smiling # you said my name. # In the sand # I have left my boat. # Next to you # I will look for another sea. # You know well what I have. # in my boat # there is no gold or swords. # Just networks # and my work. # Mister, # you looked me in the eye. # Smiling... # I didn't know you were a believer. And I am not. But she is not just any saint. Which is she? She is called Santa Rita. Do you see the thorn in the forehead? They say the Lord threw it at him from heaven. Really? Yeah. And that she became a nun while married with two children. And then she did a bunch of miracles. Already. He hadn't come for a long time. Well, you're here. What's happening? Come here, go. What's happening? Why don't you look at me? What's happening? Nothing. Come on. For. You don't need to say anything. I already know everything. Now it depends only on you. She is already. Didn't you love me? So here I am. I know, my love. I already know it. Holy shit, tell me something. That I want to go Where to? I have to go. I am afraid of the water. But what are you saying? Are you crazy or what? Because Im crazy? You should know better than me that sometimes you have to go. Already. I just don't know what it's like to leave. I already know it. Do you think I'm stupid? I know you haven't been abroad and that you lied to me I'm just asking you for time. I'm not going to screw it all up because you're out of luck. What will you know? What bothers me the most is that my mother was right. She can't trust anyone. OK. You're putting plaster on it until... The cigarette always in the mouth. Check out, check out more. More more more. Until I tell you. So? Further. If it is missing, there is water. check out Further? shake. Give it a little more. Plaster or water? Of plaster. But little now, okay? There already the hand. Give me the hardest first. Give me a little more. Well come on. She takes it like this and drains it like a doughnut. Come on. Look. Drain it like this. You put it in your hand. Okay, give me a strong hand. That's OK? Yeah. Give me more. Here she fucks him. OK. At this height, I don't think the water will reach it. Once we light it up, that's it. Give me what you have left. Repel there. We have to plaster a bit. Does something come out? Yes. Yes it comes out. This is plaster. Look, son. What's coming is very fucked up. I don't know what I would do if we lose everything. What's wrong, dad? I'm very proud of you. That you are with me and I love you very much. 1545, flood of San Lucas. 1651, flood of San Calixto. 1664, flood of San Miguel Arcángel. 1665, flood of San Crisóstomo. 1683, Santo Tomás flood. 1704, flood of San Leovigildo. 1731, flood of San Nicomedes. 1769, flood of San Simón and San Judas. 1834, flood of Santa Brígida. 1877, flood of San Cosme and San Damian. 1879, flood of Santa Teresa. 1894, flood of San Amos. 1906, flood of San Julián. 1923, flood of San Quentin. 1947, flood of Santa María. 1979, flood of San Jerónimo. 1987, flood of Monserrate.
