'...all our problems will be solved' I enquired about him He genuinely loves her He even showed me the selfie he has taken with that girl 'We were chatting' He suddenly started crying Shouldn't let go of this goose 'He's a naive idiot of the 1st order' We should milk him dry 'He has no clue how to spend his money' 'He is the need of the hour for us' - Can we trust him? - I did a thorough check He's really loaded He has already deposited cash, right? What more do you want? I can't even imagine that girl next to him She spoke to me for just a discount of Rs 500 You think she'll let go of him if she knew he's a millionaire 'Money is everything' If only I was that rich, I'll revel with Tamannaah and Hansika next to me And even click a selfie like our Saravana Stores 'annachi' Your lame dialogs when I just got up I have no option but to agree But I have to meet him before we forge ahead Brother, you love her, okay But does she love you in return?

When you started helping me you became my friend 'Open the door' I don't trust you either "Who is he, this fiery lad ablaze? Ask around and you'll be amazed" [Song from 'Bairavaa'] - Hello! - 'I'm Pari speaking' Instead of calling me from different numbers ...find a way to escape You call yourself my friend? You asked them to kill me for some random girl Don't blabber I was threatening them Will I let you down? I'm on the run for your sake I know all the bullshit He recorded your conversation I heard every single word If they shamelessly recorded whatever I spoke to play it to you ...what happened to your senses? I had a specific reason Listen why I said all that Are they such scumbags? Okay, I escaped now I'll handle them You escap- How did you escape so easily? As my friend aren't you happy I escaped instead of cross examining me? 'They are a bunch of goofballs' One goon with a good heart untied me taking pity on me He gave me ideas to escape 'But I tricked him and took his phone and ran' 'I feel bad I took his phone' This sounds fishy 'Doesn't look like you escaped' Looks like they let you escape! 'Look around to see if you can spot any of them' What do you mean? 'Just look around' You're right They are monitoring me I thought as much They will note your every movement What you should do now is- Did you call anyone else other than me? No, I didn't cal- I tried your # Line was busy I called your mother 'And explained everything to her' She was in a temple She got really scared She's on her way to meet me Are you mad or what? Such a stupid thing to do What can I d- Listen to me If you see my mother anywhere pretend you don't know her Okay, bye Auto! Go fast, bro 'Where are you going?' Stop, bro Where is my brother?

Hello I'm in the auto Crossing Saidapet now Your mother is following me These thugs are tailing me too I am terrified Go to Saidapet Court - Why go to the court? - Just do as I say Don't ask me silly questions Sit on the ground over there and stage a protest 'Close wine shops Protest till I die' Press and media should focus only on you Are you mad or what? I can't be without drinking Wine shop won't be closed just because you shout, idiot The police over there will arrest you 'If something happens to you the cops are to blame' - Shout out boldly - Okay Even the cops can't touch you! Okay, I'll do as you say 'Come what may abolish alcohol today' 'Lock...don't stop Shut down every wine shop' Get up Why should I get up? Doesn't a Tamilian have even this right? 'Abolish alcohol' How many have erupted like you? 'Till my last breath I will protest for this cause' You shove good citizens behind bars Then you're the anti social elements 'Police atrocities, down down!' 'If anything happens to me the police force is to blame' Doesn't this look like our groom? 'Police atrocities, down down!' He's getting married within 4 days and he's making an ass of himself Forever snacking! I didn't like his face one bit I said 'no' to this alliance right then 'Did anyone pay heed to my words?' Let me repeat If anything happens to me the cops are to blame Are you such a humane person? Where is my son? Tell me I'm asking you 1 minute, sir Which son? Who are you? I'm protesting for the sake of society Asking me irrelevant questions! - Move aside - Where is he? 'Tell me the truth' 'I will protest for mankind!' 'Sathya isn't picking up the phone' He's behaving like a lunatic All this is so puzzling - Come soon - What shall we do now? - Are you Sathya's mother? - What has happened to him? I'm his friend Don't get flustered - Will you get down? - Your son spoke to me He's in some fix That's why Pari behaved so weirdly 1st let's leave this place, trust me Hey! Get the car I don't know who they are But I'm driving now, we are safe Don't stop anywhere Follow my instructions - I'll meet you soon - Okay, bro Mithra, I've spotted his family I am following them Drive my mother and sister to a safer place right now What do you mean? 'How can we leave you and go?' Just go, don't argue My fault I should have killed you right then Even now narrow escape If you hadn't turned up I would have wiped out your family Even if you target us we might run in fear But if you think of harming my family- What will you do? Hey! I told you just now I won't spare any of you if you try to harm my family Come on What did you say? She's part of your family, huh? If I kill her what can you do? I thought I was a clever crook you seem to beat me hollow I'll upload this video soon Our people will forgive any crime But they will never forgive abuse of women and children Spend your last years in prison If you think you can use your clout and get out- 'A gang kidnapping destitute girls without family backing wanting to secure jobs abroad' '...has been nabbed in Chennai by our police task force today' 'Many girls in their custody have been rescued' 'Many of the culprits involved from Mumbai and Bangalore have been arrested' 'A trust in Hyderabad is also part of this whole scam' 'Since the owner of the Trust has turned approver' '...the police force believes the other girls will be rescued too' In all my years of service ...this is my 1st bullet shot You shared your location and coolly asked me to come here Thank God some chap came to complain about his missing girlfriend I came with his help Kindly don't forget to delete that video Forget such an incident took place Sir, thanks for coming Why thank me?
