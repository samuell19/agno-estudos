BASED ON THE NOVEL "HOPE GOD LOVES YOU, MOM" BY TERE LIYE Humans… Beings who are always demanding, who are always begging. Beings… who are always asking questions. Dear God, does hope exist? If yes, is it too far out of our reach? Karang, come on! Dear God… -Come on! Just walk, okay? -Do miracles exist? If yes, will You be so kind as to grant it? Nice, isn't it? Come in, kiddo. Over here. Give your bags to the adults. Let them stow it above. -Put it over there. -And Dear God, is life fair and just? If yes, where is Your righteousness? We continuously hope that one day, miracles and justice will come. One day, Your promises will indeed be fulfilled. You have engraved that beautiful verse Yourself in Your holy book. Behind adversity, there would be deliverance. But what if day after day, the hope becomes like fog under the heat of the sun? Evaporating, like remnants of water from a broken pail. Vanished. It's exhausting to wait for, even just to give a slight bit of hope, until we come to hate all hopes because the remnants of those hopes seem like they would end in vain. Hey, Karang. What are you looking at? I'm thinking, Karang. Why is it so dark already at this hour? The sky was clear when we were playing. That's called an overcast. It's going to rain. Let's go inside. Does it always get dark when it's going to rain? An overcast sky is always dark because clouds are filled with vapor. If the water content overflows, the sun can't shine through. Hence, the dark sky. Let's go inside. It's going to be all right. The rain will stop soon. -Reduce the speed! -Speed is reduced! Ten to the left! Ten to the left. Qintan, stay here. I promise, nothing will happen to you. All right? Life vests! Grab the life vests from under the chairs. Hold on! Hold on tight! Take him. Lead him. Karang, help us. Help us. We can't… Help us, Karang! Qintan! Help! Qintan. Hold on, sweetheart. Karang, I'm scared. Oh, god, please. Hold on, Qintan. Light… I see a light. No, sweetheart. Don't go. I beg you. Karang, I see Dad. Qintan! -Mom and Dad are coming. -Qintan! An angel is coming, Karang. CRUISE SHIP SINKS, 18 CHILDREN FOUND DEAD MUHAMMAD, GOD 3 YEARS LATER That's enough water. Slow down, dear. Melati, eat properly, please. Let her be. Melati doesn't like to be touched while eating. That hurts! Melati, it hurts. It hurts, Melati! Let go. -It hurts! Let go, Melati. -Melati. Sweetheart. There, there. Her progress has been quite good these past two days. Melati is calmer. Compared to before, she is more compliant. Thank god. Taking this into consideration, we think it will be easier if we-- Melati, no! Let go! Let go! Let go! The child doesn't need a doctor, ma'am. She needs a psychiatric hospital. Wretched kid! Before it's too late, she needs to be admitted into a psychiatric unit, Mr. HK. Melati is not insane. Melati is not insane. Melati might not be insane now, ma'am. But one day, her disability will cause her to go crazy. This child needs comprehensive therapy. Melati is not insane. Our apologies, ma'am. Melati is not insane. Only a crazy person could bite someone's finger off, ma'am. Excuse us. Ma'am! Melati! Ma'am! Melati! Ma'am! No! Melati. Calm down! Come here, sweetheart. That's it… Dad is in China, ma'am. There's a meeting at Han Jin Prefecture. So I'm taking his place for today. You're okay with that, right? -When did you arrive, Kinasih? -A week ago. I've been planning to visit two days ago, but I still had to take care of some errands. I had to take care of my medical license. I've missed you, Melati, and Mr. HK so much. Melati is growing more rampant each day. It came to a point where she almost hurt herself. We have tried our best to find a way, but… Dear God… Every single effort has gone to waste. One day, I'm sure Melati will be able to call you "mom" completely. To embrace you and express her love to you completely. Thank you, dear. You're a kind girl. May God bless you a good husband. Ma'am, if you don't mind, there is someone who might be able to help Melati. I used to frequently volunteer at his library during school breaks. He's someone who is really close to children. His presence always brings them joy. Are you home, Karang? Karang, wait a minute. There's another letter for you. There have been seven. You never bothered to read them? TO KARANG MY LITTLE LANTERN Qintan. Someone's here to see you. Good afternoon. I am Mrs. HK. I apologize if I've disturbed your sleep. Did you receive my letters? I'm begging you. Please help us-- You came to the wrong place and person, ma'am. And besides that, you came at the wrong time. Our daughter's name is Melati. She is six years old. She truly is a charming girl. When she ran, all eyes were on her. All eyes were enchanted. But that was then. Now, grief has taken away everything. Our daughter's condition has turned heartbreaking. The child needs a doctor, a psychiatrist… or something. Not me. We have invited numerous doctors. Even numerous well-known teams of doctors, but everything was in vain-- If they have failed, how could you… have placed your hope on a drunkard like me? I don't know either. What I do know is that we've reached our limits. We are close to giving up. So whatever possibility there is, even if it's just a bit, we will try that. You're just wasting your time coming here, ma'am. I can't help with anything. Melati is blind. She is also deaf. She can't even speak. Melati is cut off from this world. She has absolutely no way of getting to know this world and what it holds. She can't even distinguish which one is her parent. She also cannot know her God. If you ever change your mind-- Can't you go and see the girl, even just once? The last time I was with children, I ended up killing them. The child needs a doctor. Not someone who the court deems underqualified and has an inadequate academic background on how to educate children. I beg you. Just once, go and meet the girl. And if you insist on refusing to help her, then so be it. As long as you have seen her-- It won't make any difference. Karang… My husband once said, "Twenty years from now, we will regret more of the things we haven't done, not the things we have done. Even if those were mistakes--" Don't! Don't you ever preach to me… about regret. Don't ever do that. I will never preach to you about chances. Let alone regret. I… I have never asked you for anything before this because I have promised my husband that I wouldn't ask for anything from you or any of our foster children. Your unfortunate childhood… An orphan, a street kid… Yet you succeeded in establishing numerous libraries in the capital city, just like how your father built open houses for children. That's because of the love you have for children. It's not just because of their adorable faces, but because you believed… an even better future lies in the palms of their hands. Karang? I'm sorry, ma'am. There's someone here to see you. A man who doesn't blink. A spooky guy. Tell him to come in. What? Let him in? Yes, let him in. All right. Do you know the visitor? The one I told you about. I see. Good morning. -Good morning, Karang. -Good morning. Please sit. This is Karang, sweetheart. This is my husband, Mr. HK. HK. And that is our only daughter. Have a seat. Salamah, Karang will have breakfast with-- I didn't come here to eat breakfast, ma'am. I see. My apologies. No need for more plates, Salamah. Slow down, sweetheart. That hurts! All right then… Does she always eat that way? It's no different from an animal that's eating. What did you just say? Does she always eat like an animal? I thought you knew Melati's blind and deaf? I believe you also knew of her disability. So what kind of eating manners do you expect? This child might be blind and deaf, sir. But that doesn't mean she doesn't have a brain. Only brainless animals have uncivilized manners of eating. Mashing their food. Even trained monkeys could use a spoon and fork. Don't eat with your hands! Here's a spoon! You have to eat with this! No! Let her go! You! You are not allowed to eat if you continue on like this. Let Melati go! Fine. You asked for it. Melati! Melati! Hey! What are you doing, huh? What am I doing? I am teaching her. You. Whoever you are… Leave this house! You know what? Life is paradoxical, sir. At times it is hilarious, at times it is revolting. But more often, a paradox is something we cannot comprehend. Twelve hours ago, I had no interest in helping your family. It will only be a waste of time. I had no interest at all, even just to step foot inside your mansion. It will be a waste. For what? But this morning, I've changed my mind. Yes. Changed my mind just like that. A split second ago, I decided to help this child, and I don't give a crap whether you object or not. I said leave this house. Salamah! Call the front security and throw him out! Look at this child, sir. She is just as frustrated as we are! For years, curiosity has filled every inch of her head. For years, her mouth wished to speak, her eyes to see, her ears to hear. Calm down, dear. Calm down. I can go by myself. Please, my sunglasses. Tomorrow, the day after, sooner or later, whether you like it or not, this child needs me. I will teach her and find a way… so that she can know the world and what it contains. A beautiful beach Opened umbrellas and canopies All the colors Dragonflies fluttering 3 YEARS AGO Melati? Melati will never be healed, ma'am. She will remain blind and deaf for the rest of her life. But we can find a way… so that she can know this world. Know God… Know her Creator who has cruelly created her with all her disability. I shall wait for news from you. We could get the team of doctors from Singapore again. Or the ones from Germany. I am sure they are better and more qualified. I will fly there next week. -No, dear. -Sweet-- We have gone that route numerous times, to no avail. Please, dear. Just give Karang a week. Sweetheart, what do we expect out of that crackpot? I don't know. But… How could he have known the events from three years ago? He mentioned it exactly as it happened in detail. As if he was there. Dear, people say he's a miracle worker for children. Please, sweetheart. For just a week. If Melati still doesn't show any progress, I will ask him to leave quietly myself. All right? All right. Welcome. This way. I want a room far away from yours. I won't allow anyone to enter my room. Ma'am, which room should we give him? Karang, you can use the room on the left. The other left, Karang. Over there. No protests. No objections. Whatever you see me doing, it might not be what you think. And whatever you see me not doing, it might not be what you think. Do you want to have a look around the house first? Have a tour perhaps, so-- Nobody is taking a vacation in this house, ma'am. The last time you did, didn't it turn into a tragedy? For the love of God. You have to use a spoon. You eat with a spoon! Fine. If you don't want to, that means no breakfast this morning! As punishment… sit here until we finish breakfast! Now… we can continue without that annoying girl. I'm going to the factory, dear. Leave her alone, ma'am. Nobody is allowed to accompany her. Tomorrow, I want the child to eat separately from you. You want to complain? Complain about what? Go ahead and eat! Your mother isn't here, neither is your father! What are you whining about? Use the spoon! Ma'am. This is a spoon, this is a fork. Use this if you want to eat! Fine. Then no more food. Ma'am… Shouldn't we better get rid of this madman, ma'am? Poor Melati hasn't eaten anything since yesterday. You asked for it. Don't blame me. You will stay there if you refuse to use a spoon. Furious? Do you want to throw everything away? How dare you! Sit in the corner! Can Melati eat now? She is not allowed to eat if she doesn't want to use a spoon. Melati hasn't eaten for almost four days-- She won't die even if she hasn't eaten for a week, ma'am. Ma'am! Melati… Salamah, call the doctor. Quick. Hurry up, miss. -Send your parents my regards, Kinasih. -Pardon me, ma'am? Send my regards to your parents. Yes, ma'am. I'll pass it on to them. Leave. There is nothing more left here. It's all over now. The charges of the court regarding the sinking of the ship, the charges of responsibility for the deaths of the children, nobody has blamed you. Nobody has blamed me. Is that supposed to matter? Do people's opinions carry more weight… than what I feel? Did you know that every single second… It is as if I could see everything all over again. Their screams. Their panicked expressions. Oh, god. Their frozen fingers. Their blue lips. The cold bodies floating. Eighteen. They died because I took them on the trip. Without me, they would still be alive! There's nothing more for you to see in me, let alone be proud of. I no longer have a life. Leave, Kinasih. -Leave! -I will not leave. You still have everything. You are not on your own. There are still plenty who care for you. Look! Don't the children still come to visit the library that you've built? They still respect and cherish you. Nobody has brought up the incident. And even if everyone blames you, there's still me-- Where's your ring? Give it back. Give it back! There's no more us, no more ring as a symbol of our love, no more you in my heart. I don't deserve you. Leave! Melati is doing fine. Her fever has gone down. She will get better tomorrow. How have you been? You left without saying goodbye. You just left everything. Left the capital city. Left the library. Left the children. And left… I had no idea that you spent your childhood… in the city where I was born. Until a month ago, when the children mentioned a drunkard at-- You meddle too much in my life. But at least you can meet Melati, and I can see the changes in you. I can see from your eyes-- Enough! CRUISE SHIP SINKS, 18 CHILDREN FOUND DEAD I have been against him staying in this house since the beginning. Salamah has just told us that the young man is hoarding alcohol. Alcohol. Dear God. How could I let a drunkard sleep under the roof of this house and teach Melati? Have you seen what's happening to Melati? What progress? She got sick. The young man has to leave tonight. I have to catch an early flight to Frankfurt tomorrow for three weeks, and I don't want that dangerous young man spending his time in this house while I'm gone. To tell you the truth… To be honest, I have known that he's a drunkard from the beginning. But he understands children, dear. He creates miracles for them. Kinasih said that he could make a disabled child walk. He plants the seed of determination, the will to change. He-- That was in the past, dear. But not right now. He's even given up on himself. A drunkard. How could a drunkard create miracles for Melati? Forgive me for thinking that it wouldn't matter as long as Melati could be healed. You are right. I shouldn't have been wallowing in empty hopes. I should've been more rational. But… let me talk to him quietly, okay? To ask him to leave. We don't want any fights, do we? That's right. Good morning, ma'am. Have you talked to him? You… I know who you really are. The 18 children who drowned at sea… The trials, the accusations… I don't care what the judge has ruled. The support and opinions… I don't care about the opinions either. What I care about is I have never agreed to a drunkard being in this house! A drunkard teaching Melati! Never! So you know the history, sir. Then another now knows about that important incident. Stop acting like you're the greatest! Leave this house at once! -Get out! -I'm not going anywhere, sir. Aren't you the one who needs to leave? It's already seven o'clock. You have half an hour left. Even if you own half the airline, the plane would still take off with or without you. Calm down, dear! -Let me talk to him in kind-- -Sweetheart! -You can't think rationally anymore! -Sir! Sir! Sir. The chauffeur is waiting. You need to leave. If not, you'll miss the plane. You have to go now, dear. Let me handle this, all right? This is an important trip for our factory, right? All right. But when I call in another half hour, I want to hear that this crass young man has left this house. Or I will personally cancel the trip and bring security guards with me. Okay. Nobody's leaving this morning except for Mr. HK to Frankfurt, ma'am. Please. It's not because of you. Not because you're a drunkard. I don't care about news of the trials either. But… it seems like it must all end this way. Let Melati be with her disability. Please? No, ma'am. Melati has a chance more than anyone. Even compared to the chance of us throwing a ball against the wall and hitting it without a doubt. Melati will not spend the rest of her life feeling around like the muzzle of a weasel. Melati will not spend the rest of her life being pitied. All right. I will not touch another bottle. You see this? No more alcohol! No more. I have thrown them all away, ma'am. I have thrown them all away! And I promise I won't get drunk anymore. I will also mind my manners. No more rants. No more rude facial expressions. Jeje. Help Karang gather his belongings. Ma'am, wait. For Melati's sake, I beg you. Give me 21 more days while Mr. HK is gone. You can tell him I've left. I can't lie to my husband. Besides, it's useless-- Please, ma'am. Twenty-one days. And if on the twenty-first day Melati still hasn't made any progress, I will leave on my own accord before Mr. HK's return. Yes. He's packing his belongings. Yes, okay. Karang! Wait! My god. Come here, quick! Look, Karang. Am I still given a chance? In that case… I ask for the second floor to be cleared out tomorrow. -Salamah, put the table over there. -All right. What is this all for? Melati will begin her lesson in recognizing items. She needs to learn faster, with new surroundings. Ma'am, Melati doesn't have any access to learning yet. She could eat with a spoon. That merely proves that she is not crazy. Her mind is fine. It shows that she could understand lessons given despite her having no access. A dolphin can be trained to jump through hoops of fire above a pool because it has eyes as access to learning. Melati doesn't. To get her to eat with a spoon took a week. That is too slow. Where are you going? At this rate, Melati will need a thousand years just to reach the level of knowledge of nine-year-olds. -Melati has to learn faster. -This is a chair. This is a chair, Melati. Chair. A place to sit. With a new room, with new surroundings, that will force her to learn. Hopefully, she won't resist like she did the past week. Starting today, Melati isn't allowed to leave the second floor, and you may not accompany Melati either. -Salamah? -Yes, sir? I want you to clean the second floor every morning before Melati and I begin, and every afternoon after Melati and I are finished. If the door is closed, where am I supposed to enter from, sir? I will open it later. Can I come up? I see. Okay. I won't visit upstairs. No! Sit! The first time Melati used a spoon… Oh, my god. It's a miracle. And today is another day for hope, Kinasih. Melati could eat while sitting down. If Melati continues to improve like this, I won't get sick as much. Salamah! Melati is sleeping. -Please watch over her. -All right. No, thank you. Excuse me, can I ask something? Give me your left hand… -Great! -Great! Let's play again. Go ahead, dear. Pick. Which one? The right? -Right one. -The right. -Great! -Great! Karang! Is there something you want to talk about? About us? Nothing. About yourself then. You feel it more with each passing day, don't you? You're returning to your old self. You can think and feel again when you first met her. When you first met Melati, you could see the events that led to her disability. Don't let the past hold you back. The past is long gone. Yes, indeed far gone. So far gone that to this day, every second, I could still see it clearly like I'm watching TV. That's because you keep blaming yourself! Don't act as if you're the only one whose happiness has been snatched away! Look at Melati. Even when Melati's happiness was taken away, she didn't give up. Melati may not have all her senses, but she still wants to know the world. She's determined to make progress. She wants to change. Meanwhile we, you… We have our five senses. If you want to fight Melati's fate, you have to fight against yours first. You want to throw things away? Here. We have plenty. Throw them all away. Here's a thermos. Throw it. A clock? Throw it. A comb? Throw it. A calculator? Just throw everything away! It's been 19 days. That's pottery, Melati. Not a toy. You can't throw them around carelessly. This is pottery. A piggy bank shaped like a toad. No. There's no more left. Salamah, please clean this up. There's nothing more for you to throw because piggy banks aren't meant for throwing around. Sit down, Melati! It's dangerous! You could hurt your feet. Melati! Oh, my god! Miss! Salamah, call the doctor! Her minor wounds will heal tomorrow. In a few days, new skin will develop. They won't leave any scars, except for the ones on her feet. Good evening, Melati. Today… was a harsh day… for you. We can't give up, sweetheart. If God is indeed just, we will show people His righteousness so that everyone in the world would believe in God's promises. Melati? Water, Melati. This is water. Yes. Water. You! What are you doing in my house? Out! Get out! Get out! No, dear! Don't! How could you lie to me? All of you… I can explain, dear. Melati is not the same as she was three weeks ago! Stop talking nonsense! What have you all planned? What is it you're hiding from me? -Sir, the madam has-- -Quiet, Salamah! Patience, dear. Give me a chance to explain. I came home early and this is what I see? This drunkard? -Leave my house at once! -Dear! Dear, Karang has done plenty. Don't. Don't send him away-- -Enough! -Hear me out… It's all right, ma'am. Sir… All right. I will leave. There wasn't any progress, ma'am. From this day up to the moment Mr. HK has returned. Melati still couldn't recognize items. She couldn't know the world and what it contains. Karang! Karang! You said you wanted to show people righteousness so that people would believe in God's promises. Those no longer exist. God's promises are no more! Righteousness doesn't exist! Life is always fair and just, Karang. Look, when the ship sank, it was the exact same date the frisbee hit Melati. Qintan's birthday is the exact same date as Melati's. Only three years separate them. Nobody knows the meaning behind all these coincidences, but clearly, God has a plan-- A more beautiful plan? A better life? God is always right? God's decision is 100% best for us? It's all over! That child can't bring back who I was before the ship sunk, and I can't teach her to know the world. I will never be able to save children anymore, and the child will remain that way forever. Justice does not exist. And you… Don't meddle in my life anymore. -Karang… -Oh, god, please. Karang. Hold on, Qintan. Karang. You've locked yourself in your room for a week. I'm worried. Thank you. Melati? Melati? Melati? Where are you? Melati… Salamah! Melati? Oh, Dear God. Melati… Melati? Melati. Melati. Melati! Melati! We haven't finished our lesson, dear. The lesson about water is not finished yet. Melati! It's raining, dear. It's raining! You'll catch a cold. Don't come any closer! You again? What are you doing? Water. This is water. You can feel it, can't you? On the palms of your hands? W-A-T-E-R. Water. Water. Wa… er… M-O-T-H-E-R. Mother. Mother. Mo… her… This is Father, dear. F-A-T-H-E-R. Father. Father. Fa… her… Teacher. T-E-A… C-H-E-R. Teacher. Teacher. Tea… her… Leaf. Flower. Melati's bed. Pillow. Pillow. Panda bear. Pa… na… Er… Pa… na… Er… Thank you, Dear God. You are good. Ea… Aa… Aa… Yes, dear. We are all going to see the fireworks. -Is Melati ready? -Yes, everyone is. But before we head to the fireworks, there are two stops we need to make. -We need to be smart in the office. -Yes. We're doing just great. 68TH INDEPENDENCE DAY OF INDONESIA Don't forget the fireworks in a few minutes, all right? DO I STILL HAVE A PLACE IN YOUR HEART? Karang, when do you plan to return to the capital city? Expand your libraries. Everybody's waiting for you. I just… I'm not 100% sure that I could save children as I did before. If you can help Melati out of her disability, you have to believe it. Melati has opened the door for you. -Melati! -Hold it, ma'am! Don't move! Melati… Nobody gets out yet. We have to shift the weight to the back. Jeje, Salamah, Doctor Ryan, and you, move slowly to the back. Come on. -All right? -Melati! I will open the door and get everyone out one by one. Kinasih first. Come, Kinasih. Don't panic. We're getting out through the back. Follow me! Where is Melati? -Where is Melati? -She's still down there! Melati! Down there. Melati is down there. Melati, this is Karang, your teacher. Calm down… Don't be afraid. Melati! Karang! Melati! Hold on to me. On a count to three, take a deep breath through your mouth, then hold it in. One, two, three. Melati… Thank God. Melati, ma'am. -Melati! -Melati! Oh, god. Karang, how is she? Oh, god! Karang, Melati is fine, right? Melati. Please forgive your mom. -Karang, are you all right? -Yes, sir. Yes, sweetheart. Good night. What is it, sweetheart? What did she say, dear? "Mother, good night to you too." "May you… be loved by God." When God pours His eternal love on the earth, when God allows miracles to fulfill hope, do we still question His greatness and promises? Just. God is just. Everything that has been created is just. This life is always just. Even though there are times when we might not see proof of that justice… because we are too hardheaded. Too foolish to understand where justice lies. We were born weak. -Ready for snorkeling? -Without strength, Dear God. We were born blind, You gave us eyes. We were born deaf, You gave us ears. We were born mute, You gave us mouths. CONGRATULATIONS TO KARANG, MSC We were born unable to walk, You gave us feet. Even when we were born without them all, You still truly gave us the ability to see, to hear, to speak, and to move. Again, those of us who are healthy, normal, without any disability, are indeed the most pathetic creatures in the whole world because of the limitations of our minds. It has nothing to do with the level of intelligence, but it's because we are hardheaded humans. Foolish. Melati HK. A blind, deaf, mute girl who seems to be cut off from the world and everything in it… She could know You who have created her. THANK YOU, MOTHER She could do a lot more compared to others who could see, hear, and do. She does it fearlessly, with courage, determination, optimism, and the strongest will ever. She is determined to improve. She wants to change. We, who have our five senses, have we cared and given thanks? Do we know You, Dear God? And can we do… greater things than what Melati has done? Her story should have shamed us and made us think twice. Subtitle translation by: Arina Nurul Azizah
