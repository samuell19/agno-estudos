LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL 7 black, odd, low. Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets, gentlemen. No more bets! 13 red, odd, low. Who has the cheval? Who has the en plein? - Me, please. Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets. Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets, gentlemen. 15 on the cheval. Place your bet, Ma'am. A glass of water and a spoon. No. Wait. - Wait? Why? What did you pour into that glass? A cure for my suffering. - Poison, eh? Cyanide? Strychnine? Prussic acid? No, it's bicarbonate. My apologies. Never mind. - I thought… I thought that you wanted… To be honest, it never occurred to me. But… it's not a bad idea. Thank you for suggesting it. The best medicine for all suffering. Ah, then… you would be willing to do it? Well, who knows? I've no other solution left. - Good. What do you mean "good?" - No, I meant bad for you, good for me. If it's just about money, we can come to an agreement. Money? Could you… do it within 10 days? In 10 days? If I did, it'd be because I'm broke. How could I wait 10 days? - Oh, no. Don't worry about that. Leave it to me. I don't understand. - Allow me to introduce myself: I am Professor Lucedius. This is my calling card. Thank you. And I am… - Never mind, I know your name. I have a proposition for you. Do you know what Bulikov's disease is? A terrible disease, which science, up to now, has been powerless against. Well, I've discovered a serum that can cure this terrible disease. I've already tried it on rabbits, but have not yet experimented on a man. Excuse me, I don't see what I have to do with your serum. That is exactly the proposition I want to make to you: Instead of wasting your death in vain, why not place it at the disposal of science? How? - Very easily. I'll test it by injecting you with the serum I discovered. I won't deny it presents many risks. But after all, you don't care if you die from my serum or a revolver, right? That's right. And when will I have to do this experiment? In 10 days, the time needed to prepare the serum. I'll supply the money you'll need to live comfortably during that time. How much do you think you'll need? I don't know. I never was in want before. Very well, you think that 30,000 lire will suffice? 30,000? Yes, I believe so. Very well. Here you go. Today is March 21. You'll agree to show up on March 31st at my home to undergo the experiment, OK? Very well. But there must be a contract, a pledge. Never mind that. We just need a simple statement. Here you go. Write. "To the police station," Don't worry, it's just a formality. "I confess… to have appropriated," Write it. "in a moment of weakness… the sum of… 30,000 lire… belonging to… Professor Luca Lucedius." The signature… and the date. Thank you. But what does it mean? I don't understand. It means if you don't show up, I'll send you to jail. But I doubt it'll come to that. I know you're a gentleman. Wasn't my word of honor enough? - Certainly. But you can never be too careful. Goodbye until March 31st. Goodbye. When I lose, I leave. You must have the courage to go on. Sooner or later, the moment of luck comes. I had almost lost it all, then with one stroke, I recouped and won. But no! How much did you win? - 86,000 lire. Easy for you to say. - No, it's a fact. 30,000 lire banco. Banco of 30,000 lire! Who wants banco? Nobody wants banco? 30,000 lire banco! Who wants banco, people? Bet, I have 30,000 for banco. Banco! Eight at banco. Who's there? What do you want? I got caught in the rain. I took cover for a moment. Damn, it's even raining… See, kitty, we can't get one minute's peace. I'm sorry for disturbing you but keep on sleeping. I'll wait a bit until it stops, eh? Come on, kitty. We got a guest, we better be a good host. His silk shirt's worn out. My young lord's afraid of ruining his new hat. Smell that perfume. There! He caught a cold. The young lord is delicate, not like us who have tough hides. When the rain stops, he'll go home: A nice warm bed, a glass of brandy, and to hell with the poor devils who have no where to sleep. Got it? Listen my man, I happen to be one of those poor devils with nowhere to sleep. Just as you say: Shiny shoes, silk shirt, cologne but I'm a poor devil like you! And since we're here, let's come to an agreement. There's room for both of us. I'll settle down here, and you stay there with your cat. Mine? If it were mine, I had eaten it already. You really don't have anywhere to sleep? No. - Well, who would've thought it? Well, if you want to stay here… Thank you, you're very kind. - You're welcome. If I may: Matteo Boccalone, unemployed, undomiciled, retired. And my name is Alberto. I used to be a gentleman, but now I'm unemployed too. Well, If you want to sleep, goodnight. What time do you want to wake up? - No, thanks. I won't sleep. No? Well, if you don't mind, wake me up around 6. Alright, Good night, Matteo. - Night. Come on, kitty, the day is almost over. But… But it's leaving. - Fine, let it leave. Where is it taking us? - Who knows? Hurry. Let's take advantage of this moment to get off. That's it. C'mon, let's go. This way. This way! Beautiful, so beautiful… The wind is stirring, start your purring. Have no regrets and only believe in happiness. You just need a dream of love to fit your heart like a glove. Life is beautiful, so beautiful! The stars say, "A great man is he who smiles." By crooning or over love mooning, you the world beguile! Why go insane? Why feel such pain if sometimes misfortunes falls? Keep an eye on your spirit, don't you fear it, one day good luck will call! Life is beautiful, so beautiful! The wind is stirring, start your purring. Have no regrets and only believe in happiness. You just need a dream of love to fit your heart like a glove. Life is beautiful, so beautiful! The stars say, "A great man is he who smiles." By crooning or over love mooning, you the world beguile! Bravo, you sing very nicely. You got a fine voice but it's dangerous. - Why? It makes one hungry. Sorry for being informal. - C'mon. We're friends, right? More than friends. Well? Have you forgotten? What? - Food. No, I still remember. And you? I remember it, 'cause I'm trying to make you forget. Then, what will we do? - What indeed? Over there! See that farm? We'll find food there. It'll be food for them, not for us. What does that matter? What matters is there's food. And then it's first come, first serve. Let's go. What's he doing there? - Hush, don't move. Could he be a thief? - I wish! Let's go see. Then he wasn't a thief? - Did he look like a thief? When do thieves ever leave something when robbing? And then what he brought, what a beauty! What? - What? That cake. Don't you see it? How nice it smells! Just come out of the oven. What are all those candles? It must be someone's birthday and for each year, one candle. A candle for each year? Then, let's party! - What? We'll take the cake and leave the candles. No, no! That means stealing! What stealing? I'll just take one slice. OK, but just two slices. Fine, three slices. I'll keep a few candles and give them back a few years. "And after all… and after all… And after all, what is a kiss?" Beat it! - "A closely bound oath, a more precise pact, a confession that seals, if you like, a pink apostrophe placed between the words, 'I love you', a secret told on the mouth…" And who's this? What are you doing here with that cake in your hands? Is it for me? - I think so. It's for me! Ah, dear… Who sent it? - I… - You? Not me. - But you know who did? Ah, yes, a young man… A young man? A young man… Oh, it's him! Was it you? No, Sir, one moment! Why run away? You mean me? - Yes, you. I'm not running away but I must… - No, I've been waiting so long. So long… For me? Come inside, please. Come in. You! It really is you. Yeah, it's me. Why hide? Didn't you promise to reveal yourself on the 1st day of spring? When the swallows nest. The swallows are here, no? Really? - And he's your friend, right? Yes, right! He's… - I don't want to disturb you, I'll go… Stay. His friends are mine too. How did you find out that today is my birthday? They know everything about me, even my age. But so many candles! I think you overdid it, no? But how beautiful, how romantic this all is. And just think, I know nothing about you. Who are you? I must have met you before, Oh, yes, yes. In another life. You do believe one can live twice, right? What beautiful words… May I read them to your friend? Read, if you like. "Each of these candles is a small flame taken from the stake of my love." What sentiments! - He gets these thoughts… Excuse me! I'm such a mess. You caught me off guard. Just a moment. I'll be right back. - By all means. Excuse me. Let's take advantage of this and beat it. You crazy? The good part's just starting. But that nut took me for her lover, don't you get it? This is great. Don't you see there's substance here? What substance? - Food! And see how she's in love? You'd let that poor lady believe… Why should you care? We won't eat anymore. If the guy comes back, how will it look? - Hush, there he is. Excuse me, have you seen Miss Virginia? Ah… yes, she just left right now. What a beautiful cake! Who could have sent it? Yeah, right. Who knows? Did Miss Virginia see it already? She surely did. Hello, Miss Virginia! - Hello. What do you want? To wish you a happy birthday. - OK! Another time. Can't you see I've company? And also to show you my latest novelty: the flute. A flute to summon lunch. Or as it was called in antiquity, the ante prandium. Another of your useless instruments. Mr Leone delights in musical inventions. What torture! Imagine an aperitif polyphonically expressed with a musical wish. Don't play the flute! The sound of a flute makes me so sad. OK, then I'll come after lunch. Fine, after lunch. See you later, dear. Bon appetit. Good day, Miss Virginia. Good day. He's crazy. Go on and look: they are all here. What? - Your letters. Come. - But… You see, this is the first you sent me. January 20th. Almost three months ago. And this is the last: from yesterday. How I'd like to reread them all together with you! All of them? It must be beautiful to relive in reality, what you have lived for so long in your imagination. I also kept the music! I've kept all of your music. You want to see it? If you really like… - Come on. Come. This here is my sanctuary. Where I reflect, read, and relive in a dream all of my past lives. Sicily! - Sicily who? Malombra! Here, you see? Here I keep all the things you've sent me. This is your book, "The Sorrows of Young Werther." I devoured these pages… which exalt the painful torment of a suffering heart. Close the window. Excuse me, why? Night has fallen. Isn't it now noon? - Close it. Night has fallen. "Night has fallen. I am alone. I am alone on the top of a stormy hill. The wind howls in the mountain, the torrent groans rushing among the rocks. Salgar! My Salgar, it is I who call you. My beloved! My sweet! Why so late in coming? This is the cliff and this is the mountain." Oh, come to my soul. Oh, allay this madness. Come and gather the flower of my anxious heart, abandoned heart, that alas, that throbs only, only for you. Ah, how this heart beats. Ah, she's still a virgin. In which the picture of love looks like you, sweet lover, whom I await with trembling joy. Yes, whom I await. Come, the hour presses, come, gratify the hope that I can kiss you, that I can hold you close… to me. Are you done? We can open them now, right? Nadina! Do you see? - Who are these gentlemen? It's him. - Him who? My secret admirer from the letters. Then it's true, he exists? - Oh, yes. And you thought it was a joke. Instead he brought me a lovely cake for my birthday. Yes, I see. And your name? - Right, his name. How stupid, I didn't even ask. Excuse me, Sir, what's your name? My name? It's Alberto. - Alberto! A fine name. And? - And what, Miss? You have a last name, I imagine. - Yes, of course. Morandi. Alberto Morandi. - And what do you do? What do you mean? You're not unemployed? You have a job, a profession, no? Listen, Nadine, is this the third degree? After all, he's a lover, not a criminal. I thought you'd be interested. - I'm so sorry. You will lunch with us? - No, I believe we can't… Yes, we can! You're so polite. Miss would be offended, right? Of course. I'll go to the kitchen to give orders for a delicious lunch. Wait for me! In the kitchen, I'm the king of cooks! You? Why should you come? You know how to cook? Give me the pantry keys and you'll see. The keys? Yes. I'll be right back. A cigarette? - Thank you. Now the story of this mystery is over, eh? - What mystery? Letters from an unknown admirer. I hope you won't send anymore. Did they annoy you? Not too much but… - And what did they say? Why? Don't you know? Yes, of course. I meant what did you make of them? May I be sincere? - Please do. They made me laugh. - Why? Don't take it badly but I'm modern and I like things to be clear. All this stuff about letters, mysteries, flames, I don't get. My sister finds them romantic but I find them simply stupid. Stupid? - Sure! Some sentimentality just isn't done nowadays. A man likes a woman, he shows up and tells her. Maybe I'm right? - Yes, of course. Then why complicate something so simple? Are you in love with my sister? - Me? Courage! We all know now. You still want to act mysterious? It's not that I want to be mysterious but… Then instead of wasting paper and stamps, you could've said so from the start, right? - Right. Do I make you laugh? - Yes, a bit. With my letters? - Precisely. You look so blue. You should be happy you've made your dream real. Miss, I must tell you… Sorry for interrupting but it's very important. Do you want the roast with rosemary or two sage leaves? It's fine either way. I'm preparing a lunch that is "come and get it!" So, you were saying? Nothing, it doesn't matter. Excuse me? Am I disturbing? Come on, Leone! I've come too soon. You're still eating. Of course, you're disturbing. Can't you see we're eating? You told me yourself to come… I'll come back later. No, come, we're already done. - We must go! Thank you! Thank you! Right, Matteo? - Go? Why? To catch the train. Surely, you jest! There are no trains in Montelupo. Yes, I meant the bus… - I just saw it leaving. I still must go. I've appointments, business… Business? For just one day, it won't be the end of the world. Your friend's right. Don't be a workaholic and sit. Especially since it's such an important day for us, right? Oh, what a beautiful cake. Thank you. But I would've brought these. Excellent. Let's make a nice toast. Don't touch them. You would spoil them. They're musical bottles. - I never would've guessed… Why does one drink? To soften the sorrow of life's memories. But drinking is bad and thus the musical bottles. Listen to this. "Wind from the forest with the cry of the anchorite." Nice, eh? This is… "Midnight under the bridges." Can you hear the water splash? You seem to feel the humidity. Listen. What's that little noise? The tramp chattering his teeth. - Oh, my God! It was just an idea… "Dawn in a boarding school for girls." No, this is "Waking up in a barracks." My mistake. Excuse me. But… what a lovely cake. You won't even get one piece! Poor fellow. Want to try it? Yes, thank you, with great pleasure. You should've seen how nice it was with all the candles. I can imagine. It's a fine gift. An important gift. Sure, it's important. It's from her admirer. From her admirer? An admirer who for 3 months had been sending her letters. Yes, I know… For 3 months? Finally, this morning, he revealed himself. He did? But then you know who he is? Of course, we know. May we tell? - No, never mind! Sure, seeing that it's only Leone. And now there's no longer any reason to hide it. Right, dear? There he is: it was him. Him? - Well, let's stir a bit. It's getting awfully hot in here. He's right. Shall we go inside? - Virginia and Leone can sing. Just a little one, because I'm not in voice. This is too much! - Young man, what do you want to do? Scoundrel! Cheat! I brought the cake! We know. So? - I'll unmask him before all! A fine figure you'd look! A fool! A fool? - Sure. You must act like an Indian. Play dumb. I know about these things. Watch for the right moment and then swoop. Come, act cool. - I… An Indian, got it? Don't act like a fool. Leone, want a glass? No, thanks, I rather not. What do you prefer? Grappa or maraschino? - Both. Alright. - Don't bother, I'll serve myself. Really? Leone, now you're here, shall we try the duet? With your permission, right? - Go ahead. Leone, let's go. - But I… I don't know… - What's the matter? You always make me beg. Such nonsense! Let's go, come. Please, get up. Snap to it! Oh, no… Well then, you shall leave, you shall leave, you… No, it's no use, I can't. I can't sing, you overawe me. If you want me to go… Nadina, please go with him. Show him the house, the farm, the garden. With great pleasure. Shall we? - Thank you. Well then, you shall leave, you shall leave, you shall leave. Well then, I shall leave. But where will I go? I don't know! You shall go far away, far away far away to war. You shall stab. - I will stab! You shall win. - I shall win! You shall die. - I will die! For me! - For you! And this is my kingdom. She sings in there and I work in here. Do you work? - Very much. I'm the one who runs the farm. No easy task. There are so many things: alternating the crops, selecting livestock, grafting and pruning. You know all these things? A degree in agricultural chemistry. Truly? - Sorry to disappoint you. For a romantic man like you, agricultural chemistry is nonsense. I won't say that but seeing you I never would've thought that… I could be a woman who knows how to do something, right? Yes. You imagine all women leaning against a balcony with hair let down in the act of hearing a serenade. And if that were so, wouldn't it seem more suitable for a lady than planting beets? One doesn't exclude the other. - Yes. But like that, one is dry, cynical, insensitive just like you. Or how you want to pretend to be. - Pretend? You want to seem modern and unprejudiced but I bet you're as sentimental as your sister. Please, I've never wasted time listening to serenades! That was a mistake. Besides, to be serenaded, you don't need to lean out of a balcony with loose hair as you say. No, you just need to listen to it without any romantic setting. You are there and I am here. A moment of silence and the serenade may be born like this: Softly, but hopelessly, I would like to tell you my heart trembles with fear. Softly, madly, my fever of love… will burn you. Because of you, I feel in my heart… my soul vibrate with love. Because of you, because of you, because of you all my thoughts, look inside my heart, I'm sincere. From the first sun a flower is born. From the first kiss one's first love. Because of you, because of you, I might believe in love, to be able to dream, yes, to dream that together for the rest of life, we could love each other so. Because of you, I might believe in love, to be able to dream, to hope that together for the rest of life, we could love each other so. Bravo! - Thank you. Too bad you did it for me. You should've sung to my sister. Your sister? - I don't know why you resorted to melodrama with the letters. You're a nice fellow. You have a nice voice which you modulate well. All you had to do was sing and she would've fell in your arms. No, enough! No more of these stupid lies! I'll confess all: it's all lies. - How? I didn't bring the cake. I didn't send the letters. I never met your sister. I never knew she existed. I don't understand. - It was all a mistake. Then why are you here? What do you want? We wanted… we wanted steal the cake. Steal the cake? Yes, Miss. I better tell you everything. Well then, I shall go! But where I'll go, I don't know! Sorry, but I really can't today. I can't. What's the matter with you? - The matter? Fine, Miss Virginia, I can't keep silent. I must tell all! I brought the cake. - What? Yes, I'm your admirer who wrote the letters. What do you mean? You're crazy! - No, I'm not. I love you. I loved you from the first day I saw you but I didn't have the courage to tell you. But then, who is that guy? He's a vulture poster… a vulgar… a vulgar impostor! He tried to steal your love with a trick but he'll have to deal with me! With me too! Me too. And I believed… I was deluded… Rascally scoundrel! But instead, this is my secret admirer who sent me the letters. With that stupid face! You dared write me letters? Me! - But I love you. Go to hell you and your love! Do I want it? Virginia! - They'll have to deal with me! So, you're here? You are… - I'm here. Rascally scoundrel! Where is he? Where is that other sneak, your friend? He must have gone inside. - Gone inside, eh? You wanted to deceive me, no? - No, calm down, Miss. But you shall pay, you see. You shall pay. You shall pay. - Well! Miss! There. Now you know it all. If you want, you can have me arrested. Ah! There he is. Drop the mask. Drop the mask, impostor and nothing else! Nadina, it was all lies. It wasn't him. These two wretches! - Yes, I know all. All? Who told you? - He did. Jail! They must go to jail! It's shameful to make fun of me and my feelings! You're right but calm down. - You know who it was? Leone! Imagine how unfortunate I am! Just imagine how unfortunate! Men? How disgusting! Men… Now what do you plan to do? Dunno… - I don't know. Well, something will work out. We'll go our way and trust to providence. What about working? Working? One would need to know how. Can't you do anything? Nothing. - But you can try? Try how? The farm needs to be hoed and shoveled. You want to? Yes! That's not a bad idea. Matteo, what if we tried it? Fine, let's try it. Life is beautiful, so beautiful! The wind is stirring, start your purring. Have no regrets and only believe in happiness. You just need a dream of love to fit your heart like a glove. Life is beautiful, so beautiful! By crooning or over love mooning you the world beguile! Why did you make those Xs? To mark the passing of time. Why care about that? One does that when they're counting their last days. Maybe I am counting my last days. - What? Well, that's my business. Seven more Xs and then… - Then? Then perhaps only one X left. What does that mean? I already said things which you won't know or understand. Then let's be frank: Have you really decided to be a farmer? Why not? Seeing that we're here. No, I'm sorry but I'm a man of principle: I've never worked since I was born. Just imagine me starting now! Boys, wake up! Does it take an hour to get dressed? Are you ladies? You three, go load the hay. You go with all the ready men to continue Torraccia's work. Are those two coming as well? - Right. You two! You're the ones that Miss hired yesterday? - Yes. Are you going to work in that? - I don't have anything else. You'll mess it up but that's your lookout. Do you know about horses? - And how! I had a stable… What? - I meant I worked in a stable. And you? - Do I know horses? I've ran more than… - Bravo! You rode? - No, I won with them at piquet. Very funny! You'll load the manure! And you clean the stables! Go! Remember to attach the bay to the buggy. - OK. They'll work like all the other farmers. - What? They will work? Those two louts will work? Louts! Scoundrels! Thieves! Those two are thieves. Don't exaggerate. Why thieves? They didn't steal anything. Do you think so? Is this your opinion? They didn't steal anything? You think they're two gentlemen? Scoundrels who break into our house, who exploit our trust, who exploit the most intimate and delicate feelings of a lady! To steal… - Please! Of course to steal everything precious to her heart, no? They didn't want to steal your heart but a piece of cake. Ah, the cake! And you defend them! No, I don't defend them but I don't understand all this fury. They are two unfortunates who, driven by hunger, made a mistake. But even you didn't given them anytime time to talk, to explain. This beats everything! Now it's my fault? That's what you mean. Say it! Oh, come, don't get excited over such nonsense. "Nonsense?" You call it "nonsense?" The fall, the ruin of all my dreams, nonsense? Look, I can be an angel, eh? But I know how to be bad and diabolical. You won't send the wretches away? - I don't see why I should. Fine. We shall see who has the last word. May flower, hawthorn flower, love is beautiful, mad like a little Florentine urchin. Lily flower, jasmine flower, the imp love in the garden is playing hide-and-seek with a heart. Rose flower, spring flower, I gave my heart to a girl too lovely but not sincere. She is not sincere. Damn, all I needed was blisters! - What are you doing? I'm hitching up the buggy. And what about you? Don't even ask. Since this morning, with tending horses, feeding cows, rabbits, pigeons, chickens… And they say man's king of the animals. What king? A servant. But this is nice. - Yes, it's nice. I got an idea. Alberto, if we were to mount… You crazy? Steal the buggy? What's wrong with you? Then you'll die singing. What stealing? It's only… Be quiet, here comes the young lady! Hello, Miss. - Hello. Everything ready? Everything's ready. What's that? - Oh, excuse me. May I go then? - No, get on. Me? Yes, you must help me. I need to go shopping. Alright. You? It's you. - Good day. How do you dare come before me? Miss Virginia, may I give you this letter? A letter? Another letter? Don't you think you've sent enough? Go to hell, you and all your damn letters! No, wait! I want to give them back. I want to make you eat them! Eat them? - Eat them. Miss Virginia, Miss Virginia, allow me a word. Here they are. Here are your letters! No more! Get up and disappear, got it? Miss Virginia, let me explain. - No! No. I said no. - Fine. As you wish. I'll go away. I'll disappear. May it come true! - You'll never see me again! Farewell, Miss Virginia. - Farewell! Goodbye. Wait a moment. - Miss Virginia! Leone, come with me. - Oh, God! Virginia! Come with me. Come with me. You really love me? - Oh, Virginia! Don't start singing again. Are you willing to make any sacrifice? Even death, Virginia. Even death. - Good! Then you can help avenge me. - To avenge you? Yes, avenge me and avenge you. So will you tell me who you are now? I think I've already told you. My name's Alberto Morandi. That won't do. - Sorry, I got no other names. Don't be a wiseguy. I've a right to know who you are, what you do, where you're from. Right now, I'm a farmer. But you're no farmer. I'm doing all I can to be one. This is absurd. Ridiculous! But you proposed it. You want to fire me already? This situation cannot continue! Why? Do I not do my work? I worked all day yesterday. Look at my hands. See. Exactly. You think the job suits with that suit and those hands? All jobs are respectable and I won't be ashamed. You really want to be a farmer? Yes, if I may. - Fine. Be a farmer. Thank you. What are you doing with that radio? You think it'll work without power? You never know. Let's try. - What do you want to prove? Try not to ruin it instead. It already broke twice. I just got it fixed. - OK, let's see if it works. Do you prefer long, medium or short waves? What silliness! Then let's try medium waves. They sound best at this time. Shall we choose a station in Rome, Milan or Turin? By the way, what town is this? Montelupo. - Ah, Montelupo. Excellent! Then let's hear what Montelupo is broadcasting. We need a simple and popular song. One of those songs with the scent of fields and flowers. Ah, here's one! It's springtime. Wake up, young girls. At the farms, Mr April is stealing hearts. I get it. That song won't do. Let's try another. We need something more romantic, more passionate. Far away, when the night is silent, I still hear your voice caressing my soul. The sky is a spell of light and there's a star that tells me, "Your heart aches too." And like a child living in a dream of a fairy tale. I see your eyes shine in the most quavering star. Quavering… Far away, when the night is silent, I still hear your voice caressing my soul. Caressing my heart. Stop it! I said stop it! Fine, as you wish. Then let's turn off the power. You have a beautiful voice. - Thank you. Why don't you use it? - How? By singing at the theater, concerts. That's not a bad idea. But that would take time and I only have seven days. Seven days? I don't understand. Indeed, you can't. Believe me, Miss, it's better to be a farmer. Do you really want to dig the earth? - Immensely. Fine. Your loss. Play the farmer. - Thank you. Remove the horse and take these things to the kitchen. The kitchen? The radio too? No, give the radio to the maid. - Alright. Damn, what airs! Yes, but she's so cute. Cute? Can't you see she treats you like an old shoe? Exactly. But you wouldn't understand these things. There they are. Young men, come here a moment. Us? - Come with us! Why? - What have we done? You'll soon know. Let's go! You have no other ID? - Why? Isn't that enough? I can't see a thing. And you look nothing like the photo. I had it done a few years ago. Take a closer look. Now look at me. How dare you? These people's manners! Name! Matteo Boccalone. - Age? It's on there. This is taking forever! Young man, if you take that tone with me, this will end badly, eh? May I come in? Good day, Captain. I heard about the arrest and… Miss, come right in. I was about to question them. If you like to be present… Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, let's move on the next. This is your wallet, right? Yes, Sir, but… I'd rather you didn't open it. What is this now? You don't want anyone to know who you are, eh? I didn't say that. I said I'd rather not open it before all of the public. Public? He's calling us "public.". - Public! The young lady and he aren't a public but an interested party! Sir, will you finally tell us why you had us arrested? Ah, you don't know, eh? Poor innocents! Who said anything? - We'll talk about this later. Let's take a look. A nice wallet. So then, for money… Nothing. - And the rest… are all worthless cards. Here are some calling cards. "Count Alberto Morandi…" What? Are you a count? Yes. It's not my fault. A count! "Lawyer…" Are you a lawyer too? - Yes, but I don't practice. What's your profession? - Farmer. Farmer? You're a lawyer and a count and you farm? Why? Is it against the law? - I don't say that. But you'll admit, it's strange. Indeed, very strange. Can I know what I'm accused of? Do you know what this is? A necklace. - Ah, right! It's a necklace and you've never seen it? - No. Of course, you haven't seen it either? - Of course not! And you've never seen this? Boys, since you're experiencing a memory lapse, I'll tell you that the jewels were found under your beds. It's impossible. - I didn't take a thing. Try not to act so clever. The facts speak for themselves! Those items were found under your beds. They didn't get there by themselves, right? Somebody must've put them there. No. I say I didn't take anything. - Neither did I. Fine then, it must've been me. Or the professor. Me? - Or even the young lady! Sir, I swear on my honor… - One moment. Excuse me, got any evidence? No? Well then! Fine, I get it. Jail! Put them in jail! Jail! Poor guys. Now we'll investigate and look for evidence. Evidence? Isn't this enough? - Up to a certain point. If they keep denying it, maybe another put the jewelry there. Another? - Hush, Professor, you never know what you're saying. But Captain, you'll hold them in jail? Of course I will. Unless they get an alibi which proves it wasn't them. When was your jewelry found? - A little while ago, by the hand. Why did it occur to him to check their beds? You see, dear, when he heard I was robbed, he went to check. When did you notice the theft? 2 hours ago: I saw my drawer broken into in my bedroom. Were you there too? - Me? No… Of course we were together. We were practicing that duet. Why? Do you suspect another? No, not at all. - At all… Was it you? - Me? Are you crazy? How could I… It's not my style to put stuff under the bed. Then why this nonsense? Why do they take it out on us? - Don't worry. There's no proof, right? Typical judicial errors. Innocence triumphs and sooner or later they let us out. Yes but when? - That nobody knows. If they find the thief, they'll let us out. If not, they could hold us here for 2 or 3 months. But I can't do that. - Why? I have an appointment. And I got a telephone call. Go to sleep. Can you be more anymore stupid? It was like you wanted them to know you put the jewels there. I'm sorry but I was agitated. I'm not used to these things. I'm an honest guy. - Honest? You're an imbecile! Virginia… - An imbecile… I was wrong to trust you. I was wrong to trust you! Watch it, because if the truth comes out, you'll go to jail. Jail? - And not me! Who took the jewelry from my drawer? You. Who hid them in the bed? You. Who accused those wretches? You! So see you now? Me! Me! Me! I did it because you told me. It was you who asked me. Don't you remember, Virginia, when you asked me for a proof of my love? I said yes… - Nadina! Virginia, where are you? - Act indifferent. Let's… let's go sing. Come on. Aida. Let's sing the duet. Remember to stay in time. Well then, you shall go, you shall go, you shall go. Well then, I will leave! But where will I go? I don't know! She suspects, suspects, suspects. Look there! What will she do? - Heaven knows! What does she seek? - Heaven knows! Don't look there. - I won't look there! For me. - For you. There in the drawer, the drawer, the drawer, she is peeping! I'm outta here! Outta here! Outta here! Damn coward! - Yes! You will stay! - No! Don't turn around! - Yes! There will be trouble! - No! Gi-gi-gi give me the ple-ple-ple pledge… Give me the pledge of our… - Careful! Of our love! Give me a pledge of your love! - I give you a pledge of my love! Yes, yes, yes, of love! Yes, yes, yes… The voice… Your voice! - Yes. Yes, of love! This way. As soon as Miss Virginia told me, I knew right away it was them. I came here and found the stolen goods. How did you find them? - Over here. This is where the necklace was. And here the bracelet. - Strange: One for each bed. They weren't even well hidden because I found them right away. They should've hidden them in the seams, the stuffing. They were obviously idiots. - Yeah, rather too much so. What do these Xs mean? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 6 days. Has it been 6 days already? Then today must be March 30th. How many days in March? Now then… "All the other have 31…" Who can remember? Wait, I'm an idiot. I carry the calendar on my hand. January, February, March, a hump, 31. Then I must get out. I can't wait anymore. I must be out today. Councilor, I'm surprised you're not used to these places. It's easy to get in here but as for getting out… I told you I've an appointment tomorrow that I can't miss. I get it! Is she blonde? What blonde? It's a doctor. - Doctor? Report sick then. There's a doctor here. It's a pledge of my honor. I must keep my word. It's not your fault. When he finds out the reason… Yeah, when he finds out… But look you don't know. I don't know but I don't understand why you're so worried. It's fine here. Come now, it's not like it's a mater of life and death. That is it: a matter of life and death. Indeed, more of death than life. Counselor, is there danger…? Come on, don't joke. Look, now I can tell you. Here it is. "Professor Luca Lucedius, Via Nuova 110." And who's this? - The doctor, the scientist. The one for the appointment? - Exactly. And do you know what I'm going to do there? I'm going to get myself killed. That's right. Bam! A little puncture and then good night. At least, as a martyr to science, they'll make me a monument. You know how new drugs are tested? - No. You take a rabbit and give it an injection. If it lives, fine. If he dies, oh, well. Excuse me, are you a rabbit? Yes, I am the rabbit. Tomorrow, March 31st, at 10 in the morning, I must go to Doctor Lucedius' clinic to get injected with a new serum. If the experiment succeeds, I live. If it doesn't, I croak! But why do you want to go there? - I gave him my word of honor. Why give it, if you gotta die? - But I'm an honest man! You're a fool, that's what you are! And that scum! He can go to hell. I can't. He gave me some money and I lost it. Then you got the satisfaction of ripping him off. Excuse me, if you don't go, what will happen? He'll send me to jail! - So? You're already there! Hey, you! There's a person who wants to talk to you. To me? - Yeah, you. Let's go. How many days has it been? - 30. Then five years to go. Go on and sleep. When it's time, I'll wake you. You, Miss? - Yes, I came… I asked to speak to you because, you see, I've obtained information on your behalf. Information? Yes, I've written to people I know. They answered this morning. Now, I know everything about you. About your past, your life. And It seems impossible to me that a man like you could have sunk to stealing. Look… - Please, answer me frankly, honestly. Did you commit that theft? - No, Miss. If you believe I still have the right to speak of honor, then I swear on my honor that I did no wrong. Alright, I believe you. Thank you. I'll speak to the captain and hope to succeed. What? You want to free me? I don't know, I'll try. - Oh, thank you, Miss. I'll let you know what happens. Goodbye. One moment. Please, wait. Why are you so good to me? - Because… Because I pity you. Pity? The thing I never wanted from anyone, much less from a woman, is exactly commiseration. Sorry, I didn't mean to humiliate you. It doesn't matter. You were generous all the same. And then I'd like to help you be brave and have faith in yourself. Maybe, it's too late. - Why too late? I'd be so happy to help you regain your place in life. I would like that too. Never before have I loved life so much as now. It's as if suddenly, I've discovered a new, unknown world. And I owe this to you. - To me? Yes, you're the dearest, the best girl I've ever met. That's right. You can believe me. Let's go! Believe me, Captain, they couldn't have stolen the jewels. They couldn't have! That's strange. You're not the only convinced of that. Look, it's the 3rd anonymous letter I received. Always written with letters cut from the pages of a newspaper. Evidently, the writer's afraid of being recognized. There, you see? Fine, but that's not enough. Until I find the thieves, I can't let them go. But there's not one proof of their guilt. No but there's no proof of their innocence. Alright, Captain, I'll get you that proof. You? - Yes. I can assure you that during the theft they were with me. Miss, do you realize the gravity of your statement? And if you don't believe it, I can also issue a statement. Would you be willing? - Of course! Very well. Here you go. Write: "I, the undersigned…" Come in. Oh, Miss Virginia! What's the matter? The matter? - Yes. And you ask me? 2 souls… - 2 souls? Two souls groaning in the cold of a dungeon. Because of you. Because of me? - Yes. And what are you doing? Playing the harp? Nero! What are you talking about? - What? The theft of the jewels. Shame! Hiding them in the bed to blame those two unfortunates. But it was you! - Me? Yes, you! - I don't remember! I remember. Fine, I wanted to get revenge and you should've stopped me. I did but you didn't listen! You should've insisted! You should've! You didn't do it because you liked it, right? Not true. - You were happy! Devilish being! Devilish? - Devilish! Don't exaggerate. - And you stink. Probably the sulphur… - You stink of it, of burning, because you are the devil. The devil me? - Mephistopheles! Horns! I'm seeing horns sprout from your head! Your feet! Your feet are becoming hooves! Leave my feet alone! Stop it! Then there's no time to lose. Leone, if you're not a coward, run to the captain and confess the whole truth. But he'll put me in jail! - Jail? What does that even mean? What do you mean? - Do it for me! What is it? I ask you for a small proof of love! Remember: Andrea Chénier! He was a man, not you. Why bring up Andrea? I don't want to go to prison. Oh, really? Fine. I shall go myself. - No, Virginia. Not that! No, Virginia. Fine, I'm ready for anything. I'll go to jail. But I ask you for one promise: When I come out, you… will become mine? Virginia! Fine, I'll be yours. - Oh! Virginia! Here are your documents. This time, you got away with it. Don't get into trouble again. - Then we're free? It seems you're not concerned in this matter. - Who says so? Don't waste my time! Want me to put you back in? Well, if we gotta… - What are you saying? Pay him no mind, he's always kidding. - No, I… Sir, a man wants to speak with you. - Let him pass. Are you going or not? What are you doing here? - One moment! Get out! - Such bullying… Come in! Goodbye, Professor. - Goodbye. Excuse me, are they going back inside? No, outside. They're free. Free? - It appears they're innocent. So who is the culprit then? - Heaven knows. I'll try to find him and won't give up! What do you want? Me? Nothing. Nothing? If you asked to talk, then you wanted to say something. I was mistaken. I don't want anything. Good evening, Capt… Good evening. What kind of idiot was that! And they call him "professor"! It boggles the mind! Nadina, I need to confess to you. - Confess? No! No! Don't look at me with those eyes or my courage will fail me. Nadina, those two are not guilty. - I was sure of it. Do you know who took the jewels and hid them? Who? - Me. You? - But I… I was furious at the time you see. I know what I've done is monstrous but… Who knows what you think of me now? Nothing. Maybe in your place, I would've done the same. I thought they would hold them for 2 or 3 days but instead… But luckily they'll be released. - I know. I wanted to confess to remove a weight from my conscience. No, dear, don't think about it. It's all ended well. Finished well? Ah, no! If you only knew… that I have another remorse now. Leone… - What about him? That poor fellow, that angel, that martyr! Just think while we speak, he's groaning under… What is it? Excuse me, Miss Virginia, Mr Leone's here. That idiot! Who knows what he has in store for me! I'm coming. Excuse me, dear. Virginia… - But how? I thought you were in a cell, sitting on a plank. And you… The course of events took a turn. What is this nonsense? Didn't you go to the captain? I did but there's no need to. Why? Will you explain? Those two outcasts, those two martyrs… where are they? Not martyrs anymore because the captain set them free. Free? - They went out. I saw it with my own eyes. So I said, "If they're out, no use for me to go in." And here I am. Excuse me, is this the bus stop? - Yes, it'll be here in 90 minutes. Alberto, listen to me. Don't leave. Let's not start that again. I told you I gotta go. OK, fine. Go! If you knew I how I cared… Poor Matteo. Goodbye. What goodbye? I won't leave you. I'll take you to "Lucrudulus." What's that damn doctor's name? And after? - And after… we'll see. I like the idea of a rabbit. Alright. 90 minutes… I could almost make it in time… - To do what? To go to the farm. I must have forgotten something. Are you going to tell her why you're going? - Hey! I'm trusting you, OK? You wait for me here. I'll be right back. Miss… You? - Yes, I wanted to thank you. I saw the light and allowed myself to enter. Take a seat. - Thank you. I'd like to tell you how grateful I am and tell you that my days here, have been the happiest of my life. Why? Do you want to leave? - No, I don't want to. I must. If it were all up to me… - Why? Because of what happened? Don't worry, it's over now. - Not at all. Do you fear your comrades may think… They can think what they want, I don't care. Then why? You said you were happy here? Yes, that's true. Very, very happy. But sometimes fate is spiteful. We're offered happiness when there's no more time left. What? I don't understand. - Indeed, you cannot. You won't come back? I doubt it. There'd be a small chance but so small I wouldn't dare hope. Fine, go then. I can't force you to stay here. Besides, I don't really care. I said so because I like that my staff is happy with my farm. But if that's not the case… oh, well. Now you're being unfair, Miss. Unjust and cruel. You may go. Have a nice trip and good luck. Well? Aren't you leaving? Ah, right, I see now: I forgot your wages. No, Miss. You don't have to treat me this way, I don't deserve it. Maybe one day you'll find out and understand many things. If you could imagine how bitterly I leave this house. It was like a brief dream. Please, think that it was so. Do you remember that day when I sang you a serenade in this room? You were sitting over there. On that chair. Just like you are now. Please, close your eyes. But you… - No, don't say anything. We are still in that day. There. Softly, but hopelessly, I would like to tell you my heart trembles with fear. Softly, madly, my fever of love… will burn you. Because of you, I feel in my heart my soul vibrate with love. Because of you, look inside my heart, I'm sincere. From the first sun a flower is born, From the first kiss one's first love. Because of you, I might believe in love, to be able to dream, to hope that together for the rest of life, we could love each other so. Miss? Miss Nadina! - Who's there? He mustn't go. He mustn't. - What do you mean? You don't know where he's going, what he's doing. You must do something before it's too late! Before the bus leaves. I don't understand. Explain! - Please, it wasn't me who said anything. Here, I'll show you. Tomorrow he'll be on the other side because at 10, he must be a rabbit. Rabbit? - Where did I put it? I bet I lost it and can't prove it. Alright, now I'll tell you everything. Professor, a young lady wants to see you. Good, let her in. - Very well. This way, please. Are you Professor Lucedius? - Yes, to whom do I have the pleasure… My name doesn't matter. You don't know me. Please, sit down. Professor, you had an appointment this morning with a man. I have many appointments. What's his name? - Count Alberto Morandi. Ah, sure, at ten sharp in five minutes. Then you might as well not wait because he won't come. Did he charge you to tell me this? - No, he knows nothing. Then I have no doubts. I'm sure he'll be here at ten sharp. He deceived you, Sir. - No, the count is a man of honor. He gave his word as a gentleman and I'm sure he won't fail. Excuse me, one question: Are you his relative? - No. A friend? - Not even. I'm nothing to him. Then can one ask why you care so much? Because… because… because what you want to do is a crime! A crime and a murder! It was a freely given agreement. An absurd agreement that has no value! You took advantage of his moment of loss, despair and he accepted without knowing what he was doing! No, he knew quite well, Miss. So much so, he even accepted my money. Fine, if it were for money, I'm ready to pay it back. I appreciate your generous offer but I'm sorry I cannot accept. The experiment's worth much more than the few 1000 lire I gave him. I don't care about your experiment! Why don't you do it on yourself? Miss, because I'm too old. We need a young, robust organism. Count Morandi is an ideal subject. You're a monster! Sacrifice a man's life to your stupid whims! Oh, Miss, for science. For science. Oh, it's ten o'clock. He won't come. I tell you he won't come! So much the worse for him then. - What would you do? I would send him to jail. - Jail? Perhaps, he forgot to tell you that he gave this statement to me. What does it mean? If he doesn't show up, I'll report him. You're a wretch, a blackmailer! Here's what I'll do to your paper! That's a copy. The original is in the safe. Oh! Look. Here I am. I'm sorry for the delay. What? You? You here? What did I tell you, Miss? I'm pleased you've kept your commitment. Actually, I wanted… Nadina, please go away! I must talk to the professor. - No, no, no! Stay anyway, Miss. The experiment was a success. What do you mean? I already gave you the shot. The experiment was a success. When? I don't remember. - The first night we met. It was a sui generis injection, an injection of life. Because life is only appreciated when you are sure of losing it. Only then can you understand all its value, all its beauty. And I've put you in these conditions. You had wasted it for 30 years. Only this last week, have you seen that it could be worth something. Now you may go. You are healed! Professor, why did you do all this for me? Because I'm a madman who enjoys committing, sometimes, the greatest of mad acts: that of doing good. But I owe you money. Fine, you'll return it when you've regained it. As for your statement, the young lady destroyed the copy but I had already destroyed the original. Don't worry. Now leave me, because my microbes await. - Thank you, Professor. Life is beautiful! Enjoy it! Life is beautiful, so beautiful! You just need a dream of love to fit your heart like a glove. Life is beautiful, so beautiful! The stars say, "A great man is he who smiles." By crooning or over love mooning you the world beguile! English subs by sineintegral@KG
