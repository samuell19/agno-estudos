OUR LOVE TO ALL THE MEDIA PERSONNEL, CHANNEL PARTNERS AND OUR FRIENDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA A FEW MONTHS AGO Very few people go to the cobbler these days, sir. Sir, did your girlfriend buy this footwear for you? Oh! Your dad bought it for you? Your dad means a lot to you, doesn't he? Sir, I've been meaning to ask you. Do you have a hearing impairment? Oh! You can only hear sounds at a close range. Okay. Here, wear it. Man, the bus hasn't arrived yet! Be patient. It will come. I am starving. I didn't even eat anything at home. Stop... Come on, get down fast. Oh, my God! Hey! Who does your son think he is? He bashed that guy very badly! Right! Guys like him will abduct young girls in the family... and molest them... and all you'll do is put them in prison for a couple of days. Later some big shot will bail such guys out. If my son had chopped him down on the streets, I'd have been proud and happy! -Constable, -Yes. get him that machete. What's the need now? We are here to settle the issues amicably. He seems to be a thug. What if he troubles your family after coming out of prison? I hope I can take my son with me now. Yes, go ahead. - Dad. - Tell me, dear. By what time will you come home, Dad? Did you really hit a cop? Why do you always land yourself in trouble? You're a motherless child. Hence your dad is lenient with you. You won't obey me. Once she comes, she will knuckle you on your head and discipline you. Nobody listens to me here. - Do what you want! - Oldie, why are you scolding him now? Why won't I? Only two months are left for his wedding. It doesn't look good if you both go to the police station. Yeah, right! As if we enjoy going there. Hello? Yes. I'm on my way to the site. Work's going on in full swing. I'll get it done soon. - Well... - I'm done arguing with you guys! Your dad has pampered you a lot. - Get lost! You have made this a habit. - Okay, sir. Okay. - Hey! - Get lost! Hey! Thiru! Go to Chetan's shop on your way back. He'll give you a check. Did you hear me? He'll give you a check. Collect it. BHAVANI HEY BABY. WHERE ARE YOU? - Mom, don't answer if my phone rings. - Okay. Welcome, Thiru. Had breakfast? She is in her room, taking a bath. Ask her to hurry up. Mom? What is it, Mom? Honey, when did you come? Two minutes. Please. Listen. Please iron my dress. Please! You're my darling, right? My sweetheart. Please! Thiru, would you like some tea? Hey! Can't you iron your dress? She has made this a habit. Mom, why are you upset about this? After marriage, he will iron at least two sets of my dresses every day. I'll give you one tight slap! Thiru, leave it. Come and have tea. Honey! My pants... Please. Honey, sit down. Now kiss me. Hey! Why do you look scared? - We are almost like a married couple. - Thiru, tea is ready. Hey! What are you looking for? Mom, did you see my phone? How would I know? Look properly. It must be lying around. You keep it somewhere and forget it. You have made this a habit! No! The company is not responsible. Hello! Everything's clearly mentioned in the labor agreement. Then why should we wait? Whatever it is, just talk to our lawyer. Okay? Listen... - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. I've heard a lot about you. You've been a sincere worker since my dad's time. You've taken up such a huge project for the first time. Hope you'll finish it successfully. I am surprised you even need to ask. I'm not handling it alone. Remember, I told you that I have a son? I'm managing all this with his help. Wait, I'll introduce him. Hey, Thiru! Thiru! Yes, we got it, sir. Hey, come on. - Sir, I was talking about him. - Oh, yes. My son, Thiru. - He's a Civil engineer. - It's sorted, then! All the best. Do a great job. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, dear. Happy birthday. Thank you, Dad. At least come home for my next birthday. - Definitely, dear. - Dad, how's my dress? - Uncle bought it for me. - Awesome! - Where are your grandpa and great-grandma? - Dad, look at Johnny. - See, he's all grown up now. - I can see that. - I'll give the phone to Grandpa. - Sure. - Father-in-law... - Son-in-law... Tell me. - How are you? - I'm good and you? All good. When are you coming here? I'll come soon. Work's hectic. - Talk to Grandma. - Sure. - Grandma, how are you? - You tell me, how are you? Grandma, I'm good. - When will you come? - Have coffee. - I'll come soon. - Here, dear. - Hi. - Hey, what are you up to? - I was cooking. - Is Sharmi upset with me? Yes, she is furious with you. - Come back soon. - Sure, I'll come soon. I am swamped with work. Try to understand. Fix a date for Thiru and Bhavani's wedding soon. - I'll come for it. - Sure. - Bye. - Bye. So, what's your husband saying? He says he'll come for Bhavani and Thiru's wedding once the date is fixed. It's my birthday, and yet you all are discussing their wedding? Quiet, uncle's here. I'll go and hide to jumpscare him. Don't alert him. Quiet, Johnny. I'll be back. Where's the birthday girl? - Uncle! - Hey! Happy birthday! It's my uncle whom I'm speaking with, not you. You have made this a habit! You spend time with her on her birthday but you come late for mine? - They keep locking horns! - Don't blame me! It's her. - She is a kid, after all. - It's getting late. Let's cut the cake. - Mom! You carry on. - Yes? I'll lock the house and come with Thiru. Okay, dear. Oh, my shining star! You are my language of love! My Thiru's kural! A silicone statue! Oh, my shining star! You are my language of love! My Thiru's kural! A silicone statue! Is it you, really you? The thief who stole my heart Is it you, really you? The villain who stole my coyness When no one is watching You come near me like a sneaky cat When there are people around us You seduce me with your eyes The sky may wither out and fade away But our game of love will not I concur with everything That you said, my lady love Oh, my shining star! You are my language of love! My Thiru's kural! A silicone statue! - Surprise! - Hi, Grandpa! The days that I don't see you I feel like a caged bird It's not a home without you in it Like a jungle is not a jungle Without the tiger in it Life will cease to exist without air I will cease to exist without you Our friends and family rejoice As we exchange our wedding flowers A delighted bird will sing at my window Your wishes will come true My lady love Oh, my shining star! You are my language of love! My Thiru's kural! A silicone statue! - Hey, you! - Yes, sir? Is this how you spray the water? Do it properly. Hold it properly. Excuse me! How can you be so negligent? What if the cement sacks fall on your kid? - Sorry, sir. I didn't notice. - Take care of your kid. Come here. Here. Okay, sir. Dear, stay put in one place. Mom will finish her work and be right back. Marimuthu sir! Lift him! Take him to the hospital! Please wait outside. Patient's name? Marimuthu. - Age? - Sixty-eight. How did the accident happen? A sack of cement fell upon him at the construction site. So, how did it happen? A sack of cement fell upon him at the construction site. There is a lot of blood loss. I've prescribed a few tests. Get me the report, and I'll let you know. Run these tests. Go to the next block and you can get it done there. Hurry up. Marimuthu! Oh, God! What happened to my son? What happened to him? Marimuthu! Marimuthu... - Where's Uncle? - What happened to my son? Oh, God! Marimuthu! These scans are done on the second floor. The lift is over there. Step out quickly. Hurry. Men can take the stairs! Please come in. Who is this? Your dad? Come on. Be a man and use the stairs. Why are you taking the lift? Poor ladies. - Grandma, don't sit here. Move. - Then where else do I sit? - Just get lost! - He's been getting on my nerves - since morning. - Move! - Jerk face! He'll rot to death! - Stand aside! Move! Move! Do you need some special instruction? Stand in the queue. - Move! - Hey! Scoundrel! Do you know who I am? Be aware of who you're talking to! What's your name? Tell me! I can immediately get you fired! Hold on! Just wait and watch what I do to you! How dare you touch me! Sorry, sir. Sorry. It was an honest mistake. Please. I have a reputation here. Please don't insult me. Please. Are you scared? I won't do anything. Be aware of who you're talking to. - Suresh! - Sir? What's the ruckus about? Ask the next patient to come in. Okay, sir. Sir, please come in. Sir, please don't misunderstand me. Be aware of who you're talking to. - Am I clear? - Yes, sir. Please lie down. - Sir, the gel is over. - Go and get it. Sir... Your phone, sir. Okay. Somebody fetch him some water. He just fainted. Quick! - What happened? - Brother. Hey, get up. People don't listen when we tell them to eat something before running tests. Next! He was doing fine. Wonder what happened? Nobody listens! Fine, get in. Please come in. Tear... Get lost. Hey. - You need to pay first. - I'll arrange for it. - Get me the money, and I'll get it done. - You're our only hope. Go away! Look, a thousand bucks won't be enough. - Look... - Have you seen the report? Why are you getting all riled up? This is a hospital. You must be patient to get things done here. Got it? First, calm down. Give me that. I'll help you. I got the form. Let's go. Careful. Why are so many of you here? Time's up. Leave. Only one person stays. Do you need any special instruction? Leave! She's downstairs. Vinoth, Sait left with the money. You guys be ready. Remember, red colored Audi car. Baby, close the window. Baby, listen to your mom. I told you to close the window. Baby, please listen to your mom. Sir, my bike broke down. It won't start. I've been trying to start it for a long time now. Please help me, sir. Please. I am stranded here. I want to go - to the hospital. - Fine, you go. I'll come. Thank you, sir. Let me go and check. Please, don't. There's a baby in my womb. Think of me as your sister. Please don't do this. Please, let go of me. Please! - Boss, are you guys done? - Yes. We are done. - Money? - It's with us. Boss, what about the kid? Finish her off! Why aren't you guys attending my calls? How dare you disconnect my calls? You stole the money, right? I helped you plan out the robbery, and now you're deceiving me? - If I find you. I won't spare you! - Boss. - You have one week! I need my share! - Listen to this voice note. Or else I'll come to the hospital. I gave you all the details about how Sait carries the money. Vinoth gave me Aarumugam's number. I shall talk to him. It's his luck that I haven't seen or met him! If I meet him, then that'll be his end! Thiru, we are at the hospital. Don't get upset time and again. Be calm and patient. Understood? We need to get Dad discharged soon. Shall I take an off from work and be here with you? Thiru, get some water, please. Going home? Don't be shy. Ask me if you need anything here. Okay? I'm ready for anything and everything. Okay? I didn't do anything. Grandma, keep this. Everything's fine. Due to the head injury, there is a minor blood clot. - God! Blood clot? - Don't be scared. He'll be fine. I'll confirm if he needs surgery or if he can be cured with medicines. - Okay, sir. Thank you. - Don't worry. Be strong. - Give me the report. How is he doing? - Dear, how are you? Dear Marimuthu, what happened? - Coffee... - You need some coffee? Tea? Oh, coffee? Give it here. - Hey. - Yes? - One cigarette. - Sure. Here. You? Boss, why are you silent? Who is he? I'll finish him off! Just say the word! How dare he hit our boss? I'll finish him off! Why are you guys quiet? Am I the only one bothered? Hey. Keep quiet. Okay, I'll pack it. Five idlis, and three omelets? Chef, five idlis, and three omelets. Parcel. Brother, welcome! It's been so long since you visited my food outlet. - True. - Who was with you yesterday? - My mother-in-law. - Is she doing good now? Yeah, she is fine. Doctor has advised me to bring her again next week for a follow-up. I'll bring her. What do you guys want to eat? Today's Tuesday. I won't eat meat. Get me idlis and some spicy chutney. - What about you Aarumugam? - Same. Make a special one for him! Chef, the pan's burning. Lower the flame! Wait, we are packing the food. Chef, make an omelet next. Where's my parcel of four idlis and one omelet? I ordered it earlier. - That was a few minutes ago. Wait. - Make it quickly. - Okay. Chef, one meat gravy, please. - Hey. Did you pack it yet or not? - I'm packing your parcel. - One omelet for me. - Pour some sambar! - Here. Do you want sambar? Take it! Who asked for Dosa? Please come forward. - Who's pushing?! - This guy must be a fool! - Chef, pack that order quickly. - Will you give my order or not? Stop pestering me. I'm packing it, can't you see? Only raising my voice will keep such men in check. Four parottas and two omelets. - Pack four parottas and two omelets. - Okay, boss. Please don't fight. You better leave. Please. He is a good brawler. What? Did you call him a good brawler? Are you saying that we can't take him down? Good brawler, my foot! Shantha, is he out of his mind? We sent two weaklings, and he pounded them. I would have finished him myself. It's not too late. Let's finish him. Boss, I am talking to you. Oh. You have become old, boss. You have become a sissy. Forget it. We will kill him ourselves. Let's go. Why are you looking at him? He is not going to help us. - He is scared. - I am talking to you. Stop right there! Who do you think you are? - Will you give me money or not? - Haven't I given you enough? If you don't give me the money... I will release all the photos on the Internet. You are a doctor, aren't you? - Just one photo, and you will be done. - What is it, sir? Who is she? What is the problem, sir? Who the hell are you guys? Aren't you the hospital staff? Get out of here. Tell us, sir. We will help you. Are you deaf? Didn't you hear me the first time? Get out of here. You! Speak up. Sir? What is the problem? Who is she? Who the hell are you guys? Can't you hear me? Get out of here. Hey! Do you want me to beg before you? I will make things miserable for you. Speak up. Did you forget about the time you spent with me? You don't know... I can kill him just like that. I know things better than you all. So wait until my command. Or else, mind you! I'll kill you all. Here. - Johnny, come here. - Sharmi. - Give this to Johnny. - Here. - Give this to Dad. - Eat. - Sharmi, come have your food. - Yes. Eat. I'll punch you. Mom, give me some curry. Yeah, give all the curry to her. She will gobble it down. She keeps on pulling her leg. What did the doctor say? He... Did the doctor say anything to Thiru? Yeah, he said that we can go in a week. - We will leave soon. - I cannot take this anymore. Everything is fine. - You cannot bring him out at will. - Here. Eat. The chief doctor will be here any minute. Somebody should go and inform them about it. Hurry, sir... or they will shout at us. Why won't these people listen to us? - Auntie, pass me that curry. - Dear... Mom, shall I go with them? Wait here and finish your meal. You must not go there. Why are you arguing with her? - She wants to go inside. - Let her go. Go, Sharmi. See you, Mom. - Hey. - I will be back soon. There you are, you schmuck! I gave you the plan to rob the money, - and you are trying to fool me? - Madam. Since I only know you from your team, are you deceiving me? - I must see your brother Aarumugam now. - Madam... Or else I will thrash you in front of everyone. -Just point me to him, -Please, talk softly. - I will take care of the rest. - Madam. - Please come with me, madam. - Where to? Walk straight ahead, and you will find a lift. My men are standing there. They will take you to him. Where are you leaving? Come with me. I am on duty, madam. They will take you, madam. Please, madam. Get lost! - Hello! Where are you, Bhavani? - Where are you?! - I have searched the entire second floor. - I am on the third floor. You are on the third floor? Okay, I am coming there. - Hello? - Hello? Hello? Bhavani, can you hear me? Hello? Thank you. Madam, we can go now. Where are you taking me? Hope you'll give me my share! Come in, madam. Brother's inside. Let me go. What are you doing to me? Leave me. Listen to me. Let me go. Thank you. Uncle, I want to get down on the next floor. - What is it? - I want to get down on the next floor. Do you think she... She would not have noticed. She is too young to understand it. No need to be worried about her. Boss, Kumar's here with some information. Yes, what is the matter? Boss, it's the same old plan. If we plan it right, we can hit the jackpot. Every night at ten, I will be waiting in my car, and they will send the money. They will be shipping two-three crores every day. All fresh notes. It's all black money. My owner is into some big-time illegal stuff. The money will be transferred to a guy in ECR. That guy will move it to some other place. It keeps on moving between places. But if we can nab it before it reaches ECR, the jackpot is ours. But we should do it within three days. Or else they will change the driver and we will have to wait for two more months. Trust me on this. It's a piece of cake. What do you say? If they ship two-three crores every day, won't they be carrying guns? They will be carrying guns. Yes, they do, but they won't use them. The entire shipment is black money. They know that they will get caught if they approach the police. But there is a catch. He will not get out of the car at any cost. We will take care of it. Johnny, let me tell you a secret. This morning, when I went to the hospital to see Grandpa, I saw a good-looking auntie in the lift. When I came back, I saw that her body was covered and being carried by a group of men. Those men gave me the creeps, Johnny. I am scared. I don't know who to share this with. Sharmi, are you still awake? How much is it? - Hundred rupees. - Here. Okay. You can leave if you want. Grandma's alone. Thiru? How is your dad? - I am sorry for calling at this hour. - What? - What is it? - Everything's at a standstill without him. - We're facing a lot of issues at the site. - What's wrong, Thiru? We are totally helpless. - Give that to me. - Hello? - Hello. - Who are you? I am his cousin, go ahead. - We're facing a lot of issues at the site. - Okay. It's getting difficult for me to manage it alone. - Okay, sir. - I could use Thiru's help. - Can you ask him to come? - Okay, sir. Okay. Go and meet him. I am going to the hospital. Come back soon. Travel safe. I'll inform your grandma. - Hey. - Yes. - The cash has been counted. - Is it? We will be on our way in ten minutes. - Be ready. I will call you. - Okay. Bro, it's time to go. What happened? I guess it's the engine, sir. Yes? What do you want? We can't find our way. Could you tell us where this address is? - What is it? - They are asking for an address. Tell them. Give that. Sorry, bro. This bag contains one crore rupees. I will take care of the driver. Spare me. Hey! Who the heck is that? Tell him to take a detour. Hey. Go back. Leave this area. Boss. Look! - What the heck is he doing here? - I don't know. Tell him to leave. - You! Leave! - Get lost! Leave! Don't you get it? Damn, you! An attempted robbery took place in Anna Nagar last night. The assailants killed the driver, and tried to steal the money. Boss, if he had seen our faces, then we'd be in prison by now. Further investigation has revealed that black money was involved. The person carrying the money was arrested by the police. The police are further investigating the case. Boss. One crore rupees! We almost had it. It was right in our hands. This is not good for us. We must kill him. From the moment I set my eyes on the money, I've become restless! It was right in our hands, yet we missed it. It's driving me mad. Who's with Patient Marimuthu? Come here. Your father is alright. His blood has been infected. But it can be cured with tablets. - So, we don't need to operate? - No need. I will prescribe a few medical tests. - We can discharge him in two days. - Okay. - Thank you, doctor. - Thank you. Hello, Bhavani. We had a word with the doctor. We can discharge Dad soon. No, there is no need for an operation. Inform auntie. I'll hang up now. Are you serious? Yes. The doctor has told them that he will be discharged in two days. He will be leaving the hospital soon. - Vinoth? - Yes, boss? He should not leave the hospital. We must not let him go. What should we do? A doctor will spend five minutes with a patient every day. The patient has to spend the remaining 24 hours with us. If we want... anything is possible. Boss, shall we use the injection on him? - Injection? - Yes? When that injection is given, glucose in the patient's body turns red. It indicates that the injection has worked. Once inside the body, it will start to work wonders. It will slowly damage the organs one after another. In the end, the patient... Boss? Who will inject him? - Good evening, sir. - Greetings, sir. We want to have a word with you. What is it? You are treating a patient named Marimuthu, isn't it? Mari... Which Marimuthu? An old man with a head injury. He has a tall son. You might have seen him. Yeah. What about him? We want to give him an injection. Injection? - What injection? - It's just... Brother. He is our guy, bro. Just do it, sir. Come on, sir. It's just one injection. Hello. A liftman from your hospital is here to see you. Did you promise him some money? He's been waiting here for a long time. Should I ask him to wait? Shall I wait or give him the money? Some elderly man is screaming from stomach pain. Such a pity! But the nurse is not doing anything about it. Brother. Your dad is screaming. Your dad! Yes, inside. Your dad is screaming. God! My son is screaming. What is happening to my son, God? Thiru, I cannot bear the pain. He is screaming because of a stomach ache. Nurse! Come here. Why are you shouting?! You are disturbing the other patients. Stare all you want, but the doctor isn't here. Why can't they let me eat in peace? - Get the patient's reports ready. - Sir. It hurts a lot. Why is this woman shouting? Sir, she is his mom. He is screaming out of pain, and she is shouting for help. Also, she gave him tablets without giving him breakfast. Those are heavy-dosage tablets. - Sir, this is negligence. - Grandma? Didn't they tell you to give the tablets after breakfast? How can you be so negligent? Taking heavy-dose tablets without food will cause stomach ulcers. Which will then cause stomach ache. Who is looking after him? - Dr. Venugopal. - Where is he? - He just stepped out, sir. - Alright, tell him to check him. Please be strong. Sir, I have prescribed some medicines. Take rest, and you will be fine. Take care. Tell them to give drips to that new patient. Okay, sir. Thiru, take me to the restroom. Oh, God! Go. Wait outside. Dear... your dad. Dear. Your dad slipped and fell in the restroom. I feel lost. I've no idea what to do! You must have seen him cry when his dad fell in the restroom! Man! It was a sight to behold. You guys missed it. For real, he carried him like a madman. So, did Dr. Venugopal say anything to them? No, he didn't. Even if he does, it will be of no use to him. If my assessment is right, within two days, the police will be here at the hospital. We have hidden some of the dead bodies in the mortuary. The police will dig up everything and put out an order for an inquiry. We must clear out the dead bodies before they arrive. - Call him. - Okay. - Hello, Brother. - Hey. - Tell me. - Bring the van to the hospital tomorrow. Sure, I will. Excuse me. Where can we find Dr. Venugopal? - Straight ahead, second right. - Thanks. That was a close call. - Nurse, the drip bottle is empty. Hurry. - Dad. - Oh, God. - How are you now? Better. When did you all come? Just now. Here, have some juice. Have it, Dad. What is it, Dad? My stomach hurts. Brother? Shall we move to some other hospital? There's no need for that. The doctor told me that I'll get discharged in two days. - How are you, Dad? - I am alright. - How are you? - Uncle, how are you? Dad, bless us. God bless you. Look at all the troubles my son is going through! Nothing like that, Dad. You will be home soon. We will resume the wedding preparations as soon as you get back home. Didn't you hear me? I told you to leave. Go. - Do you want me to repeat myself? - Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Dad, we will leave now. Thiru will be here. Boss. The doctor is running tests on him. I'm worried he'll find out we gave him the injection. Will we get caught? The doctor is not going to diagnose it just by looking at the patient. His diagnosis will be based on the test reports. Suresh, tamper the report accordingly. Marimuthu's attender. They are calling us. Your father's reports are here. Let me check them for you. Please wait. Nothing to worry about. Everything is normal. Everything's fine. The report is normal. You don't need to worry. Alright? The stomach pain might be due to body heat. Let's wait and watch. I don't understand. Are you asking about Dr. Venugopal? Lately, he has been absent. So I will be your doctor henceforth. You can consult with me. Here. Thank you. Madam, what happened? - I hope there's no problem. - No, nothing. Thiru, didn't you ask me about Dr. Venugopal? She is his wife. Thiru, the cops were here today looking for him. He hasn't been home since the last few days. His wife has filed a missing case. I gave you all the information I had. Take care of your dad. See you later. The stairs. The lift. That camera. The other side. By the way, why aren't those cameras working? Sir, they all are under maintenance. How can you be so negligent about it? All the footage from the 28th is here, right? Yes, sir. - Show me Camera B's footage. - Okay, sir. Zoom in on the footage from that camera. That looks like Dr. Venugopal. Yes, sir. Who is he talking to? Sir, that's our hospital staff. That day, what were you discussing with Dr. Venugopal in the corridors? I don't understand, sir. You heard me! What were you discussing with him in the corridor? We talk to him quite often, sir. Any issues, sir? Yes. His wife has filed a missing complaint. Sir, he's a very nice man. He has often helped us financially. Did he tell you guys about any issues he was facing? Nothing of that sort, sir. Right. You may leave. If you get any information, tell me at once. - Now leave. - Thank you, sir. I made a huge mistake! The other day, I would have made a deal with that girl and solved the issue. You guys murdered her and also turned me into a murderer. I had no idea that you guys would be so cold-hearted. I don't care if I end up in prison... I'll handle things myself from here. - A pregnant patient died yesterday. - Yeah, right. Dean held a meeting. Are you in school? I was petrified, boss. You scared me. Man, you... - I was just having fun but she got scared. - Look over there. Did you eat? Yes, you. Doesn't seem so. - You should not sleep here. Go downstairs. - Why is he shouting? Seems like it will rain, and there are mosquitoes downstairs. Let us sleep here. Won't you listen to us? - This is not some marriage hall. Move. - You'll look nice if you shave. Nurse! Come over here. - What is it? - Tell them. Do you think that they'll listen to me? How many times should we tell you? Leave! You should not sleep here. Move out. - These people will never learn. - Come on, go downstairs. What is happening? - They are asking us to leave. Move. - Do they ever stop yelling? Heck! He deliberately bumped into me. Just say the word, and we'll kill him. No. No need to kill him. We will torment him. He should... roam around this hospital like a dog! Are you feeling romantic in the morning? You seem to ignore me these days. Nothing like that. - It was the work pressure. - Oh, is it? It's the truth. I need a small favor. I knew it. Go on. What is it? There is a patient named Marimuthu in the general ward. Yes. Thiru. Thiru. Please bear it, my son. Mom. - Are you Marimuthu's attender? - Yes. Here. Get a signature on this case sheet. Why? Just get it signed. Take the patient along with you. You have to get it signed in the next building. Understood? Yes. They gave me this sheet. We must get it signed in the next building. I don't know. It may be a discharge procedure. Marimuthu, come, let's go. - I can't come. - They will sign only if you come. We can't go there without you. We need you to get it signed. Get up and come with us. Why is he saying so? The nurse asked her to take the patient with her. God, look after my son! I am not sure, ask them. This isn't the place. Go to the next block.

In Thyagaraya Nagar, Chennai... a gang of four men attempted to murder a 16-year-old girl. The incident has taken everyone by shock. The girl's family awaits, as the doctors are trying their best to save the girl. The four culprits seem to be the workers of the government hospital. The police are also investigating their alleged involvement in other crimes. The police are on the hunt for the absconded four. Where is he? - Hello. - Mullai, are the police there? You don't know? He works with you, right? - Yes. But I was on leave for two days. - Yes, they are. Someone misbehaved with a small girl who visited the hospital. They are here to inquire about that. By the way, where are you? Boss, the cops are at the hospital. Of course, they are. They will come here, as well. Hey. Will you rat me out if the cops catch you? Come again, boss. Will you rat me out if the cops catch you? Why would I? Will you rat us out, boss? Why did you kick him, boss? He blurted out the truth. He told him everything! Hey. We injected your dad with a drug! You can't do anything, no matter how hard you try! We don't know, by now, he might know everything about us. This includes the fact that we are here. Then why did you kidnap her? I made a blunder. I went to her house... - Hello. - Sir, it's me, Sruthi. Tell me, madam. Are you at the police station? Can I come? - I can't hear anything in this traffic. - Sir, I am suspicious about somebody. - Hello, Can you hear me? - Hello! Hello! Sir... - I can't hear anything. - Sir, I am suspicious about somebody. He has been to my house before. - Sir, can you hear me? Sir? - Madam, hello? Hello? He will come here for sure! He'll definitely come here to settle the score with us for his dad and niece. You all better be ready. Please, I'm carrying a baby. Don't harm me. Please, no. I'm pregnant. Let me go. He's here! Get the weapons! Hey! Hey! Over here! Look over here! Are your dad and that girl alive? Or are they dead? Are your dad and that girl alive? Or are they dead? Thiru, didn't you ask me about Dr. Venugopal? She is his wife. God! I wonder where my son went. Where is he? Your father was lying on his bed. He was in bad shape. I told him that I'm stepping out to go to the shop. When I returned, I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere. I couldn't find him. Where did my son go? Thiru. Well... To hell with the hospital. Take me home, please. I can't bear the pain. They did something to me. Thiru. I'm scared that I might die before your wedding.
