Art, for me, is a form of nourishment. I... I need... I need the land. I need it. I want to understand that state and that energy that I have in me that I also feel in the plants and in the land. The energy and life that is running through the... Flowing through the landscape. You know, that intangible thing that is here and then gone. Growth, time, change, and the idea of flow in nature. There's two big influences in my work... The sea and the river... Both water. You would think that time would be more compatible with the tide. Time and tide... This daily up and down. But somehow, I think there's a lot to be learned about time by the river. There are always these obsessive forms that you cannot get rid of. I don't like the sensation of traveling. I feel dislocated, uprooted, and it takes me time to re-establish roots again. And when I arrive at a new place I have to begin work almost immediately. There's no period of research or resting. I go straight to work. The tide is quite extraordinary... To have that liquid movement backwards and forwards. And the cold, and its relationship to stone and fluidity. But I'm a stranger here. I'm a stranger, so... I am so out of touch with it. I've shook hands with the place... and begun. And the work's going well. I feel warm, but... Then there's a collapse. I think I've got this cold, and it's right through me. Yeah... I think good art keeps you warm. I've mistimed it today. I got up early, very... You know, 4:00. And I couldn't see anything. The moon was out, but... But it cast a shadow down here. And then once you lose your heat, it's gone, you know. Have to get it back. And I have to work with my bare hands. Because my gloves stick, and I don't have the sensitivity to do it with gloves. I lose feel of it. I always like to touch, you know... You never shake someone's hand with a glove on. It is hard... hard going. And it is cold sometimes on the hands, and I do get up very early. And all that effort is ultimately going into trying to make something that it is effortless. I wish I had reached this point about an hour ago before the sun had risen. What is extraordinary that I didn't expect but I would have... could only have dreamt of happening is that the sun coming from there shines completely on both sides of the rock. So all that icicle is illuminated and against that cliff. And I never had any idea that that would happen. So the potential... The potential here is fantastic! You know, it is water. The river and the sea made solid. And there's so many works that I've made that the thing... The very thing that brings the work to life is the thing that will cause it death. My first view of the beach was a river, and a pool that was being turned by the river. So I'm trying to touch and understand that motion... The flow and the meeting of the river with the sea. I mean, these two waters meeting. - Hello. - Fantastic! - Do you need any help? - No, I'm done for the day. When I was a boy, we used to stand on those rocks and dive in. - The water was a little deeper then... - Yeah? I think. Must have been. Do you have a name for this? This a salmon hole. Yes. - So, you caught salmon from here? - Yeah. Well, many times. Many times. Salmon. They were touching each other, they were so thick. Yeah. But I'll need such a strong connection to Scotland. You know, we have a lot of salmon holes, too. I like that. I like that feeling of the fish there underneath. - Yes. - You know that? It has a sense of a whirlpool, you know. And that's exactly what I wanted. So I fed off that motion into this piece. So, what's gonna happen? What do you expect is gonna happen when that tide hits that? - Don't worry. - It's just gonna float away! It's gonna float away. It'll move into the... - Will it stay intact? - It'll move into the pool there. No, it won't stay intact. - Absolutely not. - No. It feels like it's being taken off into another plane, taken off into another world or another work. It doesn't feel at all like... destruction. That moment is really part of that cycle of turning. You feel as if you've touched the heart of the place. That's a way of understanding for me... Seeing something you never saw before that was always there but you were blind to. There are moments when it is extraordinarily beautiful in a piece of work. I mean, though it happens, that is... Then those are moments that I just live for. Well, it's quarter to 8:00. And I think the tide's due in at around 3:00. And, well, you know, there's not a lot of time. And I think you should stop filming and collect stones instead, you know. Do something useful. The stone is not so bad. But the... We're having to walk quite a distance to get it, So, all the time we're losing... Losing time. And... So that makes for an interesting work. Maybe I quite like that, that tension. And there's a risk, you know, that maybe only this half way up, and the tide's here. And, you know, it's like a marker to that time that's coming up behind me. I began working on the beach. It's where I began. And it was a great teacher. About time. I think the relentlessness of it... There's no getting away from the fact that sea is going to be here. I was at Art College at Lancaster, and all the students were in their cubicles, as they are, and in that cramped space. And every day I'd catch a train to Markham, where I was staying. And you get off the train, and you see this big expanse... The space... In such stark contrast to the Art College. And one day, I went off and worked on the beach. What struck me was that sense of energy when you were outside of the Art College. It was very secure in the Art College. As soon as you made something outside, there was this almost breathlessness and an uncertainty. Total control can be the death of our work. Oops. The stone's speaking. I've never had one do this before. And I think it possibly... It's either the sand that's settling, and... Or the weakness of the stone. Or even the combination of the two. But I don't think this is going to... I think that I'll make this the widest point and just try to get some weight back in the middle to start securing it. Damn it all. Shit! This is my work, you know. Too many unknowns. I think its chances of survival are a bit slim. Shit! No. Let's go. We need a very heavy stone right here. Can you bring me a very heavy stone, a kind of lumpy squarish one? Maybe I shouldn't have put that one on. - Can you get one end down here? - Yes. Just put it gently on this. - Ready? - Down. You okay? That's the fourth... The fourth collapse. And the tide is... coming in. I think it would be better to wait. The moment when something collapses, it is intensely disappointing. And this is the fourth time it's fallen, and each time I got to know the stone a little bit more. I got higher each time. So it grew in proportion to my understanding of the stone. And that is really what one of the things that my art is trying to do. It's trying to understand the stone. I obviously don't understand it well enough yet. People make small piles of stone to mark pathways in hills, mountains in Scotland, and I think all over the world. So all the cones are related in some way, and they have become markers to my journeys and places that I feel an attachment towards. And then it has a quality of this guardian, the way that it stands and feels as if it is protecting something. I like the connection the form has with the seed... Very full and ripe. I think to look at stone and find growth, and is expressed in the seed within stone is a very powerful image for me. The sea came in and the cone just disappeared. And then it was gone. But it was still there. The work that I had only just finished making, so my contact with the stone was still very, very strong. So I was with it down there, but I still couldn't see it. What I have touched on this time is that I haven't simply made the piece to be destroyed by the sea. It is... the work has been given to the sea as a gift. And the sea has taken the work, and made more of it than I could have ever hoped for. And I think that if I can see in that ways of understanding those things that happen to us in life, that changes our lives, that causes upheavals and shock... Can't explain that. That deeper rhythm of change I can't see other than in my home. And, well, this is why my homeplace is becoming more and more important to me. Bracken is a material that I have always enjoyed working with. But it's a very hard... It's a very tough plant to work with. It's very aggressive on your hands when you're pulling it. It's like razors. And I always associate the material with bleeding hands. And it's one of the few plants I use a knife on. And it's a very toxic plant, too. When it's sporing, you shouldn't really inhale at that time. And I think we misread the landscape when we think of it just being pastoral and pretty. There is a darker side to that. Where they've been in the ground, they've gone black. And I really like that idea that the contact between... The alpine cows with bells. I like the idea, that feeling that the contact between the plant and the... Sorry. The flavor of the fire makes the energy of the fire visible. Well, it's the same with this black. It's like a result of the exchange of energy that has taken place between the plant and the earth. And that... through that process there is an exchange of heat that gives it this... Well, it looks charred. It looks painted, but it's not. That's just the root as I find it. And I think at this time, when spring is beginning, that it doesn't begin on the surface, it begins below, you know? So this idea of finding evidence of that heat within the ground is something that I... in a way, is my way of understanding what's going on at the moment. And even though these are stalks from last year's plants and will not grow again this year, they are still connected to that root system underneath the ground. And the idea of what happened last year is being repeated this year, and it's going to come through this. I am fascinated by those processes that are happening in nature over time and connected to the sun, the light, the tide, growth. The real work is the change. Bacon will be ready. Okay. Want some? Yes? No, it's a surprise. Yeah, it's cooling out. Probably you guys can get it. I called you stupid. Guys, you don't say that. Will that do? Yes. You want some bread? Here we've been cooking... Frying bread all morning. The rabbits. Don't forget to give him some green leaves, Holly. I won't. No, thank you. Pull it out then. Fun. Pete, come on. Pete. I'm coming. - Pete! - This is a little...! I'm gonna hold you. You sit. - I'm gonna hold your fingers. - Okay, hold my fingers. Pete, Pete! Come on! The pupil is dropping. Floppy. Floppy ears. Yeah, I think we're good. And then there's the... I do my first one of the day's two. Each are underneath here, and these all turned out. Check them for spelling. The images are coming from Charlie Sorkin. Okay. I began taking photographs when I was a student at Art College when I first began working outside, and I had to explain to my tutors what I was making. And the way to do that was to take photographs. So it still is a little bit like that. Photography has become the way I talk about my sculpture. And Brancuzzi once said about sculpture, "Why talk about sculpture when I can photograph it?" It's the language through which I talk and describe what I've made. It's also become the way that I understand what I have done. When I've worked all day in the rain, and I'm tired, I get visually and physically numb to what I've made. And I need that time between the making and the return of the images to be able to see afresh what I've really done. And I have in here everything... Good work and bad work. Everything is put into here. I'll see you later, then. Just to work with the tree, if you want to. The tree. Okay? - Okay? - All right. See you later. What you going to make? Where are you going to make it, the tree on, Dave? Who are you working for? You know, but what are you going to make at the tree? I work intuitively. Most days I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have no idea. I haven't worked there for a while, so... Is Wallis going to help you? I think Wallis is there, yeah. So we'll see. I came here I think 12 years ago. All my children have been born here. Most of my good friends are here. I make my best work here, and I think those are indications of how strongly I feel for this place. Yeah! Take the ball away! Fine, Johnson! - Hey, Audrey. - Hello. I've lived in places for four or five years and moved on, and that is not enough time. It really isn't enough time to understand the changes that happen in the place. You have to live on the same street, the same village for a long period of time, and seeing children when they're waiting at the bus stop grow into adults and have children of their own. There was an old lady in the village who since died. She was quite a doer Lady. And she'd had a tough life. And she used to walk up and down the street that I lived on, and I said, "Well, you know, think about it this way." Since I've been on this street, my son... Well, all my children were born there. My eldest son was the first child "to be born on that street for 21 years." And she said, "Well, you see only births, and I see only deaths." From her perspective, she just knew all the people who had lived in those houses and who, you know... Who had died. And I hope I never forget either those people who have been born, and those people who have died. Somehow the river is that line that I follow. The river has an unpredictability about it. It really is unpredictable. And that line running through, yet, at the same time, having its own cycles related to the weather and the sea. It... So if I had to find something that would join the year together, it would be something like the river. The river is a river of stone, a river of animals, a river of the wind, a river of the water, a river of many things. A river is not dependent on water. We're talking about the flow. And the river of growth that flows through the trees and the land. And here's the other lamb on its own. Just place it up there. Make sure it's most clear. Check that her udder's okay. And that was all over very quick and painless. And if we just retreat, and they'll get back to the lambs. Can you bring the lamb to drink? I think this one would be safe here. The sheep is very brutal to any young growth. And the way it rips and tears the grass. They are, at times, like a river of sheep. The flow and movement in their own way. The reason this landscape looks as it is, with no trees, is because of the sheep. So the sheep have had this very deep impact on the land. And... So I do feel this need to work with the sheep. And, yet, our perception of sheep is so different to the reality of the sheep. You know, we... In that it makes it an incredibly difficult thing to work with because we perceive it as being a wooly animal. And to get through that wooliness to the essence of the sheep is very, very hard because sheep are incredibly powerful animals in their own way. They have been responsible for social and political upheavals. The Highland Clearances, when people were put off the land, the land lords put sheep on the land and moved the people away. And they've left their story behind them. And it's written in the place, in the landscape. But there's an absence in the landscape because of the effects of sheep. People have lived, worked, and died here, and I can feel their presence in the places that I work. And I am the next layer upon those things that have happened already. I don't think the earth needs me at all. But I do need it. To just go off into the woods and make a piece of work roots me again. And if I don't work for a period of time, I feel... I do feel rootless. I don't... I don't know myself. And it's very odd if I've not worked for, say, two, three weeks, and then I give a lecture and I'm talking about my work, and it feels like I'm talking about somebody else. I do need to be on my own at times. I enjoy being by myself. There are people's company I do enjoy. And there probably is a social nature, too. And that I feed from that to some extent. To be honest, I think I do. I am tired. I am drained by... people. But of all the subtleties that I am aware of, like the fact the wind has just now got a little bit stronger, and although, you know, I look as calm as I did 30 seconds ago, there's these little warning bells inside going. When I make a work, I often take it to the very edge of its collapse. And that's a very beautiful balance. Oops. Dear. Well, that was close. I am so amazed at times that I am actually alive. Well, that happened occasions. Well, on occasion, when someone very close to me died. It was my younger brother's wife. Very young. And the image of... The image of somebody dying... Julia dying... Was just very burnt in your mind. And the day after Julia's death, I worked with the tree. It seemed the right place to go. And made, the work... La work with a hole on the tree. I've become to see it as a kind of entrance, a visual entrance into the earth, into the tree, and stone. That entrance between which life both ebbs and flows. Looking into a black hole, I've often described as like looking over a cliff edge. There's this sense of being drawn into the black as you're drawn into the depth, the distance. But the other side of that is out of that comes growth also. And that was my way of trying to understand that... And not just the death, not just the absence, because the black is the absence. It's the... It's the intangible, but it's in a context of a tree that I know will come back to life. And there's nothing more potent to me than a black hole that I've made, and returning later, and seeing a little finger of growth... Growth, a blade of growth growing out of that black. That is such a potent image. You and Maxwell were saying that Scotland's a lot better than England. I have never, ever said that! When have I ever said that? I'm not going to... There's a brilliant rock. The first wall that I made with a waller... You know, my idea was that I would work with him, to make the wall. I used to gap... that's repair, broken walls a little bit. But he kept taking my stones off the wall. And, you know, he was right to do that. I've learned that I have to respect their work, their life, you know. And when I work with a waller, it's not just the time they spent with me, but they bring their lives to it. They don't want me to touch the walls, playing at being a waller, just like I don't want them to start playing at being artists. That we both each have our roles in this. And my role is to find the line of the wall. And I work the space. Their dialogue with the stone is what makes the wall. The stones are laid on, and on, and on, and the work makes itself to some extent. And it's that fluidity of working that gives the sculpture a sense of movement and energy. When I was asked to make a work at Storm King... And I spent a lot of time walking around, just getting to know the place. And I see these walls, that's now derelict, that are a link back to my home. Because these walls were probably made by people who came out from Europe, possibly even Scotland... Who came out here as settlers, made farms, made walls. So that was the first interest. I wanted to redraw the line, remake the wall, so that it talked about the place as it is now. The walls here came out of that process of cutting down the trees and turning the forest into farmland. But then farming has shifted away from this landscape. And trees found shelter in the wall and grew. So it was this dialogue that was of interest to me. That each bast of wall is a line that is in sympathy with the place through which it travels. And that sense of movement is very important to understanding the sculpture. While the movement, the passage of people, the movement of the wall, the river of stone, as it runs round the trees, the river of growth that is the forest. And it has made me aware of that flow around the world, the veins that run around the world. The reason why the stone is red is because of its iron content. And that's also the reason why our blood is red, too. I do feel a... There is a special energy about the red. I mean, it's probably its relationship to blood. But probably something that I can't really explain entirely. I think it's the color is an expression of life. Even though things die, they're part of that flow still. You know, they become part of the river of red. In Japan, you'll see a red maple tree against a green mountain and this incredible red. And it's like a wound. It's like a wound in the mountain. There's such an energy and violence about that color. And I will al... I am in a continuous pursuit of the red. And I have this feeling that as I approach its source, the more I begin to understand the color. You know, there are many lessons to be learned by that color. And I think that when the realization was that I... The color is also in me, you know, then it's this feeling of both a color and an energy flowing though all things. I must have worked here several times before realizing the red here. You know, it's not so obvious. And just looking underneath stones, you find these small, red, soft iron stones. That something so dramatic, so intense, could be so... At the same time, so hidden. It's so underneath the skin of the earth. And there's a real shock at seeing that color. Something very alien to the river. In fact, it is so rooted and about that place. You know, here I am working with the stone, grinding them down, and... You know, I spend all this time... Several hours... Making a little pile of pigment that I will make into a ball, and throw into the river, and there'll be a splash. And that's just an instant in that cycle of stone as it goes through its process of solidification, of then becoming fluid again, and then being solid... Made solid once again. And I think it's one of the... It's a little memory in the life of a stone, but very much in the spirit of that... In the nature of stone. We set so much by our idea of the stability of stone. And when you find that stone itself is actually fluid and liquid, that really undermines my sense of what is here to stay and what isn't. When I work with a building, I try to use the whole wall... To touch on a landscape contained within and behind the building. It's almost a memory of the building's origin contained in the walls, and it's drawing out that memory. I wanted the clay either from Dean or a clay from Scotland. What I didn't want was a sort of anonymous, processed clay that came from some ceramic shop somewhere. The clay is dug raw from the ground, and I sift out some of the stones. It's dried, then it's crushed, and mixed with human hair, and mixed with water... Reconstituted. And the hair is necessary to bind. And I could use sheep, cow, horse, but I do like that feeling of people being bound up in there. The hair came from the hairdresser's in the village near to where I live. So my village is in this work. I discovered when I made the first clay walls that the architectural geology of the building where beams were affected the drying rate and formed cracks and patterns within the cracking. So what lies bellow the surface affects the surface. Of course, it feels alive, yeah. If anything, it's an expression of the stone alive... Almost back to its origin as in a volcano, you know, when the stone was alive. I mean, it's always alive, but that visible evidence of movement and eruption of the stone. There's that feeling of energy within it. And that's life. I cannot then explain beyond that, but I know that there is more than just a simple collapsing and arrival of material. I struggle to say these things, and I know I can just about get them out, but there's a world beyond what words can define for me. Words are... do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more.
