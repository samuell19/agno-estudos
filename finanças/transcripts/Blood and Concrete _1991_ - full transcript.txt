I tattooed your name on my ass. How was I supposed to know you were a Nazi? Oh, Julian, I really wanted it to work. I did. Too bad you really wanted a boyfriend. Dear Abdul, you were kind and gentle, and schizophrenic. A shoe salesman, gang member, TV actor, pornographer. MONA: And finally, you, Lance. You were such a good... ...lay. Are we dead? I don't think so. Can-- Could you help me, please? Actually, I was trying to kill myself. Could you put it off? Oh, what's your name? Mona. Mona. That's a-- A beautiful name. Mona Lisa.

Hey, how's the case goin', Hank? Three dead scumbags, no clues. Hey, you know, maybe you ought to file it inactive with all your other cases. Yeah, the legendary Hank Dick and his famous intuition. Now, you wouldn't wanna blow your pension so close to your retirement, would you, pops? Got us some doughnuts and some coffee. You all right? I want you to go. You heard what I said. About what? Our date is over. Okay. Right now? Let's go get some breakfast. Some eggs will do you good. Get out! Seen my shirt? This is good. This is... ...very nice. I gotta get out of this town. Oh, shit.

Well, I mean, I don't think I should get real close to anybody right now. I've had my share of problems with men, and the last one made the Marquis de Sade look like Pat Boone. Marquis who? Forget it. Well, I... Maybe we can go on a date sometime. Why don't you move in? Oh, man. Hi, Joey. So where's my bag? Three bucks, partner. You know there's a 24-hour limit. Come on, Thelma. How are you? Spot me this time. This time is the fourth time. No money, no bag. You're going to Phoenix too? Oh, good. My daughter has a rock garden there. And there's one big rock in the middle. Oh, it's beautiful. I lay down near it once a day, and it rejuvenates me. Do you believe in rocks? Yeah, sure. I like rocks. Oh. Some people believe in those mineral baths. And mud. I think the water's polluted. You can't pollute a rock, can you? Can you? No. Rocks are like stars. They have a special aura, and temperature and personality. My favorite is sandstone. It's so compassionate, and sensuous. You have a wonderful trip. Aren't you going to Phoenix? Uh, no, I can't go there. Thanks. Gotcha. Hello, Joseph. Detective Dick. Let's drop the formalities, kid. Call me Hank. Okay, Hank. You weren't thinking about borrowing this car with the keys in the ignition now, were you, Joey? No. Naw, naw. This is my cousin's car. And he doesn't-- Grifting small change from old ladies. That'll buy you three months in the tank. She's my aunt and she-- She's a very nice lady. She had to give me a couple of bucks. Let's go for a drive, stupid! I'm clean, Hank. Hank, I'm clean as a whistle. I'm a new man, Hank. I've got my eye on you, son. HANK: Your fingerprints are all over the place, pal. It's a mess. You're scum, Joey. He is scum. I'm not gonna tell the coroner about this. He can bleed and rot until I bust this case. And as for you, you can rot in the hole. Let's go. He was alive when I left here! Come on, slammer time! He owed me 400 bucks, the asshole! You're the asshole. Four hundred bucks for what? Talk! Ow! Aargh! Ow! Why did he owe you? I ran something. For who? For Mort. From who? I don't know. Ow! Spuntz! I did it for Spuntz! Spuntz? H. Spuntz? What did you deliver? A big box. A big box? You idiot, you don't even know what you were handling. Where did you meet Spuntz? Meet? You know no one meets Spuntz, Hank. I made a blind pickup. Come on, upsy-daisy. You didn't kill anybody. I don't wanna go to jail. I want Spuntz. I want him so bad I can taste his blood. I dream about him. He ruins my appetite. I think about him when I shit. I even have a picture of him. Twenty years I've been after him. And I can smell him now. How can such a small-time buffoon cause so much trouble? You're gonna help me, right? Yeah. How? My intuition tells me that he's gonna come after you, and you're gonna lead me to that pig. You're gonna tell me everything that happened or your balls are going to fry. Don't fuck with me, boy, because I'll send you down on murder one. Don't, because I will. I'll-- I'll promise-- I'll help you, Hank, I swear. I swear. Coming. Hey, baby. Miss me? Lance, what are you doing here? I said I didn't wanna see you anymore. Aw, come on. You didn't mean that. Fuck off. Wait. Wait a second. I thought you might be needing-- Stop!

Jesus Christ, man! Watch where you're going! I ought to kick your ass! Well, go ahead. Asshole. Ow! Fuck! Dickhead. I told you that is it! Am I in or out? Come in. I'm sorry. There was just some idiot banging on my door. A lot of idiots in this neighborhood. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. You can put it in the closet. Think it'll fit? I made you dinner. What are we having? Chicken and noodles. They're ramen noodles. Mm. They're good. So do you, um, chew, or do you just shovel? Sorry. I eat when I'm nervous. Well, what are you nervous about? I was almost a murder suspect today. A murderer? It figures. I'm not. Do I look like a murderer? I'm a nice guy, right? Uh-huh. Mm. Yeah, you're a nice guy. You're a very nice guy. So, what do you do for work? Um... I'm in a career transition at the moment. You got a job? Envelopes. I stuff 'em, I lick 'em, and I send 'em. Sounds interesting. I wanna take you somewhere. Okay?

Fuck you, fatty. I'll put you back on the streets! Joey, that gun. That's pathetic. Uh... Now, Bart, everyone knows Joey Turks never carries a loaded gun. Calm yourself, lad. Pull up a chair, Bart. Joey, do you know what you ran for me that day? Lab name: LBD. Street name: libido. Some of my colleagues make this: Into this: This new pill fills that one void that causes so much desperation in so many people. Love, physical love. Fucking. It's what everybody wants. Isn't fucking the answer? Libido makes you feel warm all over. It makes you wanna reach out and touch someone. It makes you wanna fuck. Over and over. And the sickness you feel the next day makes you want more. A few tastes and you're addicted. Bang-o! You're addicted to something you already want to do. Heh. It's beautiful. I bring people together. I have most of my earnings invested in this product. It's the only batch on the entire planet. I procured them. I want them back! Where are they? I didn't steal 'em. BART: Howard, can I use one of my personalized bullets? I want my drugs. I want my drugs! I want my drugs! I want them! I want them! I want them! I'll help you!

You must be real fucking losers to fucking listen to this shit! Oh, man, no beer. Hey, baby, what are you doin' here? Lance, I don't wanna make a big thing out of this. I just came down here to tell you... ...that I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't wanna hear from you. I don't wanna fuck you anymore. And I don't want you to come to the apartment. You know, you should've called me, because we could've had a little duet action. You're such an asshole. You repulse me. Really? It's kind of a happy coincidence because that's when you fuck the best. You dick! Ow! Hey! Hey, wait! Maybe I was a little hasty. All right, look, what I really wanted tell you was, do you remember that rash you gave me? Well, it's all cleared up, and I'd suggest a talc for you, if you want. You just-- Come on! Get off of me!

Joey, what is going on? So who's the guy with the tattoos? We're in a stolen car, you've got a gun. Where are we going? It's not loaded. Who is he? You disappeared for an hour. Is that blood? Is that that blood? Is that--? Who--? Who is he? He's some guy I used to fuck, okay? Now are you happy? Pat Boone? I'm trying to get him off my back! Well, he's off! Because we're getting out of town. What? We're getting out of town. What? We're hitting the road? Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car! Now, Joey, what are you talking about? I answered your question, now you answer mine. What is going on? I'm in a little bit of trouble and it would be a lot easier if we could just blow. What kind of trouble? I'm not gonna begin to get you involved right now. I just met you. I don't know who you are or what you do. I'm a car thief. All right? I'm not a very good one, I-- I-- This is for show, okay? I don't even need this thing. How about it? I just can't be impulsive. Mona, you asked me to move in with you 12 hours after we met. Yeah, well, I just can't run like that. You're gonna have to go without me. I'm sorry. Pardon me, sir Stop flirting with her The lady's with me With that come-hither stare It can't get you nowhere The lady's with me You're not to blame For digging a dame But let me repeat What do you want, Turks? What kind of car is it this time? JOEY: It's not a car. What? Are you pimping now? No, Ack, I need some info. Libido, what's the word? That's out of your league, kid. I pay you for information, not advice. I smell what I smell. There's only one hatch available. Who's got it? Somebody lifted it from Spuntz. Ack, I know that. Now swallow your chow and give me some straight answers. I need names. You're killing me. Somebody hit Mort. The stuff is gone but it ain't on the streets, anywhere. There's a big silence around town. Loud silence, boy. Check with Sammy Rhodes. He may know something. What's Sammy got to do with this? He's a philosopher. He knows things. What's it worth? Spuntz laid a big egg. All his cash, a million at least. A million? Joey, you never saw me and I never told you anything. I never saw you, Ack? Hey, Mr. Lee! More chow fun. Okay. I've given you your place in the universe, and now you must-- Sammy. Sammy, how you been? Joseph. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. I had a dream about you. About the old days? My dreams aren't necessarily rooted in reality. I saw your face. You were a goat. Ah. You were grazing on my lawn. Look at my lawn. See how perfectly trim it is? You did a beautiful job. My dreams lately have been about the symbiotic relationships. You gained nutrition from my lawn. My lawn stayed perfectly trimmed. I was a happier man. I-It's like my garden. Everything laid out in perfect balance. Symmetry. Harmony. Survival. Hm. Well, it must be working for you. I mean, look at this place. Jeez. Heh. What can I do for you? I'm getting a lot of heat on me to track down this drug called libido. I was wondering maybe you might be able to-- No. I am completely out of that world now. Look at me. What do you see? Look at me. Look in me. You see a clean man. Completely clean. How do you think I got all this? I got out of the world that you are in. You can get out. I wanna get out. And I got a woman now and I think I have a way out. What way is that? Well... I have a vision of you with a bullet in your face. You see it also. I find this stuff, I'm sitting on a million bucks. You know, why should they get it? I need your help as a partner. I can't do this myself. The dirty world is dangling a carrot. Go clean. Could I nibble just a bit? Heh. Joey, I love you, but you're on your own. I knew you'd call, baby. Well, this is the last time. Yeah, I'm sure of that. So where is the little gangster? I figured he'd be moved in here by now. How long did that take, about three hours? Now, what is it that I can do for you, I wonder? Don't act stupid. You know. Yeah, I guess I do. One little piggie. Two little piggies. That'll last you till tomorrow. Go ahead, take it. I can wait. Mm. How bad does it get? You're just a little girl, aren't you? Sweet little girl. Who loves to fuck. Hello? JOEY: Hello, Mona?

Follow me? Would you cut it out? That's my chair. You take the tiny one. I'm sorry about last night. Look, I-- If I knew something, I'd tell you. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How are you? I'm-- I'm good. Ahh. That's... Ahh... Joey? Who killed Mort, Joey? Hell. I'm in hell. You haven't gone to the cops, have you, Joey? Cops? No, I haven't gone to the cops. Hank? It's been a while. Yeah. One day. Well, hello, big boy. Hey, isn't this your old turf? Huh? You still selling your... ...meat on Santa Monica Boulevard? Huh? Let's go for a ride, tiger. I've had it with your bullshit, Joseph. It's boring. JOEY: Hank! Wherever you go, stiffs follow. Why don't you just calm down, Hank? You know. I don't. You know! Spuntz. Ack. I know you've been seeing those filthy cocksuckers. You've been playing with me. I'm gonna come through. And nobody plays with Dick! Nobody. Nobody, nobody, nobody! I'm working with you, partner. Partner! I'm gonna waste you right now. But you're not worth the space you'd take up in a cell. It's the truth. You fucks have never told me the truth. Forty years I've tried to scrub you fucks off the street. You fucks, you fucks, you fucks, you fucks! You fucks aren't gonna ruin my life! I'm going out of here with flying colors, you weasel! Hank, drugs. It's drugs! Spuntz's. Somebody killed Mort and stole 'em. I think it was Spuntz. He hides his drugs, he kills his own people, and the street value goes up, and I'm on the inside now. I will deliver. I won't lie to you. You'll crack this case. Please, just put the gun away. Please. I do bad things. I-I-- I steal cars. I-- I lift change off old ladies, but I am not in with Spuntz. Thank you. Oh, jeez. You hungry, Hank? Stinking little shit. LANCE: Well, I'm a hunk A hunk, a hunk A hunk, a hunk Get out, Lance! That's no way to greet your little love toy. Please, don't do this to me now.

Express yourself about my wine. It's good. You are a simple man, Mr. Turks. Bartholomew, get ahold of yourself. Ah. The music. The drama. Are you familiar with Verdi's Otello? I, um, am not a cultured man, Mr. Spuntz. Simple story with a strong and moving message. Listen to the passion in Otello's voice. He is outraged and hurt. Why? Because Iago, Otello's servant and inferior, has betrayed him. So outraged is Otello that he will soon kill Iago. It is so sad. This is a scam. You got the drugs. You're killing your own people. You're hiding them so you can raise the value on the street. You're next. Right? Boys, it is time for me to retire. But, stay, Joey, and have dessert with Bart. I'm full. Have dessert. Sit. Listen, I didn't tell Hank Dick nothing. Although he's been on my ass. Listen, Spuntz is gonna kill us both. We should help each other.

Jesus Christ, I told you! Would you fucking lighten up? I'm not fucking lying! Talk, talk! I went to Mort like always. Bullshit! He didn't have any to sell. Said they weren't his. I don't believe you. It's true. I need 'em as bad as you. I don't believe you, Lance. He won't even return my fucking phone calls. Please, Joey. Can I call you Joey? Look, I don't wanna die. I love Mona. What do you want? SPUNTZ: Give me a minute, please. No. We only have a few of these pills left. Thank you for the reminder. Nobody asked you to pump them in your mouth like M&M's. Shut up, you pig. I want you to find Turks and find my product. Kill him or don't come back. Now, get away. You give me reason to leave When you know I'll stay You give me reason to stay Well, I'm on my way Under this poet's moon I move and I speak too soon I know needles and nares I know Magdalene and Christ One makes a deal While the other pays the price She can walk crooked And high and drunk and lost While he gets the cross How would I know love now?

DUMAS: This is the perfect hideout, man. JOEY: They'll find us here. We gotta get out of here. No, listen. If somebody was trying to kill you, the last place you'd go is for a bite to eat. Right? Somebody is trying to kill me. I'm not hungry. That's the point. You eat, you live. Beautiful, man. Buckle your goddamn seatbelts. I don't-- I don't think there's a seatbelt back here. Buckle the fuck up, skank! All right, all right, I'm looking for it, man. Relax.

I'm gonna fucking kill him, and then I'm gonna fuck him, and then I'm gonna fuck the two of you! Ha-ha-ha! I'm gonna fuck the two of you! Stop it! I'm gonna fuck the two of you! All the great artists got themselves deep in the shit. And when they got out, they got bored. Look at Hemingway. Blew his brains out. Gun right in his mouth. BART: Yoo-hoo. Ah, your little boyfriend is here. The closer you are to death... Isn't that just a pleasure? The more alive you are. No! Adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline, adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline, adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline, adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline Adrenaline Oh, no! Sammy! Sam? JOEY: Sammy. Sammy, you out here? Joey? Why are you lurking in my garden? I need your help, Sammy. Can you lend me some money? I don't lend money, Joey. I make it. Loans are against my nature. What's your problem? I'm in over my head. Spuntz wants to kill me. Uh-huh. And what do you want? I wanna stay alive. I wanna make some money. I wanna get out of this town. As I recall, Joey, I told you to get out. Yeah, well, I'm in, so can you help me? I'm begging you, please. Look at you. Always in a big rush. Always the quick buck. Never took full advantage of the situation. You have to think. Use your head. Go back to the beginning. Be thorough. Retrace your steps. What, that's it? Joey, you're the boss now, not me. Use your goddamned head. Mort. You little fuck. MONA: This is getting a little crazy, Joey. I thought you were dead. I'm not. What's in the suitcase? Give me a minute. Who's after you, Joey? It's me. It's Joey. This is the last favor I am ever gonna ask you. I'm gonna need a hundred thousand. It's worth 10 times that. Then get me in touch with someone I can unload it on. Yeah. Yes. No. Uh, ring me here. At 555-- 4812. 4812. Meet me at the southeast corner of the Sunnyside Cemetery. Sunnyside. That's for real. And listen, I swear to God-- Well, this is quite a career transition. Mona, I'm being used. I'm-- I'm being squeezed from both sides. In about two hours I'm gonna be rid of all this shit, and I'm gonna get out of town and you're coming with me. And going where? Anywhere. I love you. Heh. You've known me for three days. I-- I like you then. Look, we-- We belong together. How's that? The two of us, we're both...losers. Well, I guess you have a point about that. Why don't you just put the gun down, Bart? I just tried calling you. Where the hell were you? It's all over, pud. SPUNTZ: I am the very model Of a modern major general I've information veg-- Hello, Joseph. I'm sorry about Bart's manners. I've told him over and over to respect a man's castle. You can only spank a farm boy so many times. And how are you, miss? Joey, who the fuck are these guys? I think she's behind the whole thing. Why don't you just leave her out of it? Are we a little spunky today, Mr. Hero? Now, Bart, don't take your own frustrations out on other people. Do you mind if I sit? Thank you. BART: Oh, no, you don't. Bart. Please help me, will you? I'm stuck. You are a pig. Hey! Why don't you lose a few tons? For chrissakes. Why, thank you, Joseph. Please, sit down. Sit down. Were you planning a trip? Mona was. Visiting her mother. SPUNTZ: Oh? How nice. Where is home? Connecticut. Oh, really? I know the state well. I was a Yalie man myself. Oh, you were a Yalie flunkie. Shut up, you degenerate hick. Joseph, I must apologize to you. When I told you the story about Otello and Iago. Otello does not kill Iago in the end, but as far as I'm concerned, he should have. Damn it to hell. Where is it? And now I'm going to kill you, son. Have you no information for me, my child? I need a few more hours. Look, I've almost found the drug, but if you kill me you're never gonna find 'em. You're right, Joey. So we'll kill her. JOEY: Okay, okay. MONA: Joey? Okay. Stop it! Mm. MONA: Joey. I'll talk! MONA: Stop it. Joey! Mm, mm. Suitcase! They're in the goddamn suitcase. Thank you, Joey. Freeze! Homicide Dick.

Get him-- God. wh--? Get out of here! Do you know this guy? Yeah. HANK: Well, get rid of him, honey. MONA: Excuse me. Are you alone? I feel like I'm on top of the world. And I wanna thank Junior here for all of his help, not to mention my own 40-year intuition. You have nothing on me. You? Ah, move your humper. Move your humpers! All right, you look very nice today. Get up against the wall. Get over here! Get in there. Good work, son. Thank you, Hank. Pack your things, meet me in the cemetery in one hour. But, Joey-- Look, if you don't come with me, I'm going alone. That won't work. Was--? Was it the pills all this time that made you feel something for me? I don't think so. Good. At last I have your fat ass, Spuntz! Oh! Open the cuffs. Give me the gun. Fuck you. Fuck you! No, no! Not the-- BART: What are you holding back, you fat fuck? No! No! BART: You dick. Fuck you. There he is! Come on, you bozo! Don't lose him. Shut up, you fat slob. Mona, I'm here to work out our relationship. I think we may be a little codependent. And I want you to know that I'm a new man. I've changed. I wanna settle down and I love you. Let's run away together. Can you hold on one second? SPUNTZ: What the hell is this? Get us out of this mess! Damn it. Where's Turks? Have you lost him? Oh, God. Come on, you! Is this even the right cemetery, you baboon? You lost him, damn it, you lost him. Can't get into a goddamn graveyard? For chrissake. Look at this. Look! Shit. Hello, Joey. Sammy? Joey. What are you doing here? You called me. Where's the man? I'm the man. I don't get it. There's nothing to get. Nothing to get? You got out. A man's gotta make a living. I got kids to feed, a maid to carry. My wife. She likes the finer things in life. Let me see 'em. Joey? Let me see 'em. I don't feel too good about us doing business like this. You don't have to feel anything. You're here to do a deal. May I see the money, please? Ah, very good. You're thinking. You must keep to your plan, never waver. Ah? Hm, that's what it's all about. What it's all about. Not you, Sammy. Joey, where'd you find 'em? I went crazy searching. Pool filter. Ah. You used your head. You know, At first I thought Mort hiding the drugs was a handicap to my situation. But then, I had a dream. I was lost in a great desert. I was totally naked and in great need of water. Then I came upon a mirage, and there you were. You were a camel. How many humps did I have? You had two. So I climbed upon your back and I rode you. I knew that your instincts would lead me to water and you did. Thank you, Joey. Uh, you're welcome, Sammy. But a camel gets awful tired carrying all that weight. God created a man, God created a camel. One of them's got to do the shit work. I'm sorry, Joey. BART: Joey! Joey! What the fuck? How do you start this damn thing? BART: Gonna get you! Joey, I'm coming up behind you, Joey. I'm on your left side. I'm on your right side. I'm on the left side. Oh! Oh, you've got me So excited You've got me so excited Joey? Joey! Yoo-hoo! BART: Joey? Joey? Joey-poo. Where are you? Joey? Oh, Joey. Everybody knows Joey Turks doesn't carry a loaded gun. Oh, my God! Sweet Jesus. Joey! Son of a bitch! Mort? Mort, open up! Mort, open up! Come on, man! I tried calling, your phone's always busy. You ever hear of call waiting? Mort! Mort! Mort, come on out of there! Mort, you're dead. Oh, Mort. Oh, Mort! Mort, you're holding out on me! Ow! HANK: Spuntz, you porker. I had this analyzed. You paid a million bucks for a combo of caffeine, valium, and a mild laxative. Love's been around Since time began Yet I never found the time Now since we've met I'm a different man The time I lost I found in you I found in you In time Beautiful Was the night Full moon So round and bright We're just beginning Well, get 'em out of there, will you?
