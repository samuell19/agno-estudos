It's coming down. Tell me what it's like. It makes everything feel like... Like what? Like a blank slate, new and promising. Maybe that's what new years are for. Do you ever make any resolutions? I try, but I'm not good at keeping them. - Molly... - Ryan, I'm... Sorry, you first. No, you. Was it that house i was living in? Or where I come from? Or was it just me? Tell me the truth. It wasn't any of those things. So it was just kristen? Because I really want to understand what happened last night. It doesn't make sense, if... You're the most... Important... Knock, knock. Preston. Oh. You have company. No. No, no, no, no. Can you just give me a minute? Please? No, it's fine, we were done. No, no, finish what you were saying, please. It was the most important... Study help I've ever gotten, and I'm really grateful for it. That's all I was going to say. Merry Christmas, Molly, and good luck with... With everything. Yeah, you too. We're going to want to get the legal department on that radio station deal. And then after lunch, I need to see Roger about that app development. There's my killer. Always catapulting us into the future. Well, somebody has to. Ha ha. Hi, dad. So, how was your business trip to Chicago? Cold. How was new Orleans? Humid. You wanna switch next time? You bet. You free for dinner tomorrow? Uh, tomorrow, why? Who needs me tomorrow? I do. I thought we should start talking about your 25th birthday, taking over as ceo. It's time to start drawing up the papers. Oh, I can, uh, get Preston roped in, too. Our newly-appointed cfo should be there. Sure. Make it a real celebration. And maybe part of a bigger announcement? No, dad... Come on. Turn 25, hitch yourself to a real go-getter, take over the company, and get your trust all in one. Can you set us up for steaks at mccann's tomorrow with Preston? And tell publicity I'm coming down. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Red meat. Publicity. Turning 25. Yeah, who'd have thought? There he is! Home for the holidays! Oh... Oh, I missed you. I missed you, too. Oh, no, I got this. You have a real nice mom. Oh, he knows. Don't you know? Yes, I know. Your room, and your desk. But I kinda re-purposed it. And Italy, your favorite. Yeah. George Jones and Johnny cash are in the closet. You're not mad, are you? Mom, of course, you should have. But I might be done with the road for a little while, and I was thinking I could crash here? Really? I can make it work. I can work at the dining-room table. Are you serious? I'm still looking at possibilities, but I thought I might, you know, stick around after the holidays this year, if that's okay. Of course, it's okay. Oh... Oh, I really should have checked with you first. But you know what, we'll get you unpacked, and we'll get you sorted... Oh! What did you pack? Books. That's what I did on the tour buses. Ever hear of an e-reader? Real books with actual paper? I like the way they feel. You know what, I might swing by the bridge this afternoon and pick up a new one. Oh. You didn't hear. Hey, Eloise! Happy holidays, Charlie. I can't wait for the re-opening. Oh, very soon. Thank you. Hey, Bert! Hi, Charlie. Okay. Luther! What's the good news? Show him. No way. You finally did it. All thanks to you introducing us in the cookbook section. How are the repairs coming? Well, we're nearly there. My favorite people! Do you have a date for the re-opening yet? Miss big-shot law firm partner. Ah, any day now. In the meantime, Luther just got the lease for his restaurant. So you just camp out there until we're ready for our big day. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Charlie. We need to put in more orders for that new bestseller. They went fast. I know. I can't believe everyone actually came out in this weather... Days like this, I wonder why we ever started a business made out of paper. Oh, Charlie! I think I've got another leak! Do we have any more buckets? Sure, yeah, maybe I can steal one from the cafe. - Donna! - Charlie! - Donna! - Charlie! Water's coming in the roof! There's a huge hole! It's coming in quick! Let's call 9-1-1. There you are. You didn't bring your scarf. I, uh... Heard from the insurance company. Fred's insurance on the building only covers structural damage. What about our renter's insurance? The bare minimum. Far from enough. We need to repaint, buy furniture... Most of all... Books. It's their final decision. Hey, do you remember ray curts? He was a teller at Winston hills bank. Well, now he's a loan officer. I ran into him. Uh, Charlie, that's not our bank... He was talking about how much this place meant to him. I'm meeting with him tomorrow. I've got a great feeling about it. Charlie... We're late on our lease, we can barely pay our bills. What are you saying? We've had so many wonderful years here, but we need to be honest about what's going on. I know what's going on. This is still our dream. We just... We need to have faith a little longer. And there's always room for hope. God wouldn't have brought us this far to give up on us now. Christmas is coming. Good things... Happen at Christmas. You'll see. All right, my love? Within 10 years, I'd like to play at that club, have my music there, be considered in company with part of everybody else that's been there. Okay, now you. What? Hey, stop it. Stop it. Come on, cut it out. Right, you've got to say stuff out loud, right now. It's your video. Yeah, but you'll be in my life in 10 years, so... What do you think? Uh... What? Say it. Say it right now. I don't think I want to run my dad's company, and... I'm not even sure i want to stay in Seattle. Molly, i can't believe i just said that. Preston, hi. Peking duck for me, long life noodles for you. Thanks. Hi. Hi. ...the last day of every school year, my mom waltzed me into the bridge to pick out my summer reading. At first, I thought I'd hate it, but I fell in love. I have a son now, six months old. We read to him every night. Nothing better in the world. So... I worked the numbers a million different ways. Bookstores are hard right now. I tried explaining how unique the bridge is, and that you and Mrs. b. Have made it work for so many years, and it was just bad luck with your roof, but I was told it's too big a risk. I am so sorry. We can't offer you a loan right now. Charlie... I would've called, but I wanted to tell you in person. Your store means so much to the community. You're like family. Well, I'm... I'm sure you did everything you could. If you wouldn't mind not mentioning this to anyone, I'd appreciate it, thank you. Hi. You didn't answer your phone. How did it go? Oh, Charlie. We still have options. No. Fred heard from the insurance company, too, and without our back payments, or a promise of catching up, he wants to put the building up for sale January 1st. He wants to offer it to us first, of course, but... Two weeks? There's no way that we could... I know. Now, listen, Charlie, I heard about a new job opening at pricemart. You're a good salesman... I'm a bookseller, Donna. All right? I sell books. I know, but if we don't stay open... We have to! So, what, are you saying you're giving up? - I don't want to... - Yeah, but you are. What else are we going to do, Charlie? If we don't talk practically about this, it won't just be our store, it will be our house, too. Now, I love this place just as much as you do, but it's been months, Charlie, and we are facing... Look, if we... So, if we just... Give up... What did it all add up to? It doesn't change who you are. Maybe Christmas isn't coming after all. Don't say that, Charlie. I'll meet you back at home, okay? No. Let me drive, Charlie. Okay? Come with me. Leave your car here. We can pick it up in the morning. I just need a minute. Hello? What? Wait, what... What are you talking about? When? No... No, no, no. Charlie's in a level 3 coma. That means he's unresponsive to eye, verbal, and motor testing. He's on a respirator because he can't breathe on his own. What are his chances of coming out? Well, if the swelling from his injury resolves quickly, it's a matter of days. What... What do I do? Talk to him, tell him what's waiting for him. And no one knows for sure, but people believe it makes a difference. And there's a chapel down the hall if you're interested. Praying never hurt. Anyway, I'll circle back in a few hours. Dr. mats is an excellent doctor. Charlie's in good hands. Um... I... I need to call some people, so... I'll do it. Give me your phone. You stay by his side. Everyone on this floor knows what you and Charlie mean to me. Last time I even tried to pray... Charlie's the one with the faith. We'll find it together, then. I'm here, okay? Charlie bartons has been in a terrible car accident, and when I saw your name on Donna's phone, i thought you would want to know. If you want more information, my number is... I'm so sorry. You don't know any more? There was a mention in the Franklin paper, "bookstore owner in an accident." He skidded on ice, then he hit a pole. So, you looked it up. I haven't seen them in years, I never went back to Franklin. I left it all behind. No one in this room thinks you left anything behind. Did you watch that video? Okay. Please... ...stop me from doing something I'll regret. Why would I do that? Because it's a place I lived for three months. Why should I go back? Honey, you don't just miss Charlie or the bridge. You miss the girl you were there, or else why would you be watching the video this many christmases later? Why do you know everything? We both know if you don't go to Franklin, in three months, you'll be ceo, engaged to Preston, and never look back. It's now or never, right? Well, that is not young Ryan Kelly... How you doin'? Man, you sure grew up a lot since you used to try to sneak in here underage to hear the music. Ah, not that often. Every weekend. Come on. I seen you've been playing backup gigs around the country. Good on you. When you heading out? Actually, I was thinking about sticking around here, trying to find some new work in town. Ooh... yeah. That bad, huh? It's the new technology. Makes for fewer gigs, and those go to locals who stuck around. You know what? I just lost my back-up guy for amateur night. Tuesdays and Thursdays? If you're serious, it's yours. Good way to connect with the regulars. Start tonight if you like. It's only two hours. Sounds great, I'll take it. I gotta get out of my mom's house as soon as possible. Welcome to lucky. Thanks. Ryan Kelly! Kristen? Ooh! Oh, I didn't know you were back! What are you doing here? Me? What are you doing here? I'm gainfully employed. Me too. Starting Tuesday and Thursday nights. Amateur night. You're gonna be so much better than the last guy. So does this mean you're staying? Everything okay? They fire you? No, nothing like that. I took a break from the last leg. Thought I'd try to get something going around here, you know? Stick around for more than just the holidays. What about you? What happened with your degree? Why are you waitressing? Well, I guess getting married and divorced in the span of two years leaves you with a lot to think about. I guess I'm just doing the same thing you are, trying to figure out what comes next. I'm staying in my parents' guest room. My mom turned my room into her office. Drinks after you play tonight? Yeah. Yeah, you bet. I'm gonna go grab my guitar, though, and stop by the bridge, and see if they need anything. Oh. You haven't heard. About the flood? Yeah, my mom told me. They're rebuilding, or so I thought. What? Um... Charlie was in a car accident. He's in the icu in a coma. Ryan, I'm so sorry. I figured you heard. You know, people are leaving voicemails like crazy. Jenny said she would be happy to sue the pole. The weather forecast doesn't call for snow this week, but we're hoping for Christmas. I brought some of your favorite decorations, too. I... You're the talker, Charlie, not me. All I can say is... Come back to me. Please. Ryan Kelly. You didn't have to come, but I'm so glad you did. The bridge, you and Charlie... What can I do? Nothing. We're just... Waiting now. This was probably... I brought some books. I thought I might help you restock, or you could read to him... Or I could. I actually don't have that much going on right now... Wait a minute, not much going on? In your emails, you mentioned all that work you were doing on the road. I'm back now. Well, that's good. It is good, isn't it? How about I grab you a coffee? Yell at a nurse? Buy you lunch? You know, there is one thing. I don't know if Charlie remembered to lock up before he left. Just give me your keys, I'll stop by tonight, and I'll bring you back some dinner, too. Well, I think edna has that handled, but... I do think I want to head down to the cafeteria and get something very bad for me. Besides, I could use the walk. Charlie's a fighter. Have faith, you'll see. Come on. Hi. Little house in the big woods. You guessed it my first day in the bridge. Somehow you knew how badly I wanted a family like that. You made such a difference, you and Donna and the bridge. I came to tell you that. I wish I'd said it sooner. I wish I'd sent a note, or something, but... I guess I just came to say thank you. Molly? Ryan. What are you doing? Charlie. Oh, of course. Yeah, edna called, and... Edna? Yeah, she thought that I might... Even though it's been... ...seven years. Yeah. She was right. I don't know what I thought I could do, but just if there was anything... Yeah, I was running an errand for Donna, and I got all the way to my truck and realized I forgot me... Oscar? Oscar the truck? Yeah. Yeah, I haven't driven him much in the last few years, though. Oh, new truck? No, no, you know, I've been on the road, playing music. Oh. Great. Right, I remember you saying you were going on tour. Yeah. How's kristen with you being away? Your wife? Do you guys have kids yet? Uh... no, we... We never married. She married a guy that she met in Virginia at school. And I never got married, so... Hmm. But you're engaged. To, uh... Oh. Preston? And the company? Your dad's... Yeah, in three months, I'm taking over as ceo. On your 25th birthday. Looks like it all worked out, just like your dad wanted, huh? Well? Okay. Uh, Ryan, wait. Are-are you... Yeah? Sorry, uh, if you're doing anything to help Charlie and Donna, I would really like to be a part of it, if I could. It's why I came. Sure. Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know. Okay. Bye, Molly. Bye. I thought Ryan not being married would be a good thing. Well, not if he never married and he never called. You never called him. Because he was going back to her. They were gonna be together forever. - You okay? - Yes. I mean, it's just, I'm sad. At least you're feeling. That's more than you've done in a while. I guess I just thought that if I came back here, things would be clearer. That I would know about my future, what I'm supposed to do, but... You do know. You're just too chicken to say it out loud. Are you coming home? Not until I make up for being horrible and do what I came here to do, which is help the bartons. That's what this trip is about now. You could do worse. You're a good friend, you know that. Best friend. I'm sorry about this. Call when you need to, okay? Okay. Bye. Talk to me. You've been quiet all night. I told him to give up, at the bookstore, right before the accident. What state must he have been in, when he got behind that wheel? Don't do that. People say things. He knows how much you love him. So much I told him to give up his dream? He's coming back. That's what you tell him, what he's got to come back to. See, that's the thing, our insurance appeal was denied. There's no money for the repairs... What? Why didn't you say anything? Because he thought we'd overcome it. Fred's putting the building up for sale January 1st. Donna... I'm so scared... I'm scared that's why he's not rallying. No. Stop. There are so many people that are pulling for you, so many people that know Charlie would never give up. You need to let him know you're one of them. Donna said you'd be here tonight. The bridge is in trouble. Donna and Charlie are in trouble. Their lives are gonna go up in smoke unless somebody does something fast. Are you willing to help? Yeah. It's terrible. I had no idea. No one does. That's the thing. He was too proud to say anything, and now... What do we do? I don't know. But I thought, if we can rally enough people who care as much as we do... ...we might be able to figure it out. We're gonna have to. Hi. I'm not sure if you remember, but, um... Molly callens. Yeah. I-I, um, I really don't mean to barge in, but I was hoping maybe you would have some time... The storm hit everyone pretty hard. I mean, people were cleaning up for weeks. You know, if it wasn't for the condition of our roof, we might be like everyone else. You know what, I want to hear about you. What are you doing in town? Um, actually, I came to see you and Charlie. Really? After all this time? I never forgot Franklin, or my time at the bridge. I mean... I know it was short, but... It was very important to me. So, Molly, is your life good? Are you doing what you want to do? Who's that? Well, look who I found. Hi. Hey. They're from the bridge. I was just bringing them for Donna. Oh, and your keys. Thanks. Do you want some tea? I can make some more tea. Oh, no, actually, I've got to get to lucky. I don't mind. I'll make you some tea. Lucky? Oh, yeah, yeah, I just got back to town, and, uh... It's... It's not really important. Sure it is. You're playing at lucky. I'm happy for you. Yeah. Well, I should probably get going. Okay, see you. Hey. Can I ask you a question? Sure. We need to help the bridge and Charlie, and I just thought, this needs a wider audience, so... Would you know how to get the word out? Yeah. 100%. Where do I sign up? So, you're playing lucky. It's really not what you think. Oh, come on. Today, it's back-up for someone else, and tomorrow, you're... ...setting the world on fire. You still believe it? I never doubted your talent, or that you'd end up where you want to be. You, um... Gotta go? Uh, yeah, I do, but, uh, could I get... You want my number for the bridge stuff... Yeah. Is it the same? - Yeah. - I got it. There she is. Preston. Your dad had a two-day conference in Nashville. He sent me in his place. Wasn't that thoughtful? Super. I figured it'd give us a minute away from Seattle, and you've talked about this place enough. Why'd you come here anyway? I'm still pushing that radio station deal through, so... Yeah. So... We could do dinner? Or be part of the conference. I'm gonna take some time to myself. Actually, I'm beat. I'm gonna turn in. Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure. Good night. Good night. If you're asking if I sent Preston down there after you left without telling me where you were going, and after you went back to a town you said you were never going back to, then yes, I did. I'm your father, Molly, and I'm concerned for you. What, that whole speech is emotional blackmail. Molly, what are you really doing in Franklin? Tell the truth. I'm-I'm tired, dad. I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. Molly, wait... It's so awful. Should I just... I'm seeing Donna later, do you want me to take it to her? - Would you? - Yeah. I mean, I don't know them that well, but... Sure. Thanks. Oh, uh, Lonnie. Molly. Please give Donna my best. See you. Bye. I still remember when Lonnie first moved here to work in the music business. You remember everybody. Charlie's the one with the real memory. He'd be so touched to see how kind everyone is being. Maybe he does. Hey, how did you and Charlie meet anyway? Fighting over a book. At the opposite kind of bookstore from the bridge. Who won? Me. Right. But he leveraged it into a date, so he says he won. Did you know that Charlie was the one right away? I could see his heart from that first minute. He had me from go. I still feel that way when I see him. Every day. I think that anyone who ever gets to feel that way is very lucky. Don't you agree? Yup. - Hi. - Molly. I think I know how to save the bridge. Can I come in? Yeah, yeah, come on. The store is a testament to Donna and Charlie's love, both of books, and of each other, and they use that love to connect people and help them become who they're meant to be. You know? And I don't know, maybe it's 'cause I was 18, and I didn't know any better, but last night, I was looking at the website, and it helped me remember that magic that allowed customers to find those stories, and the people that were meant to change their lives. And I just feel like, if we could get that out there, that people could rally around that, and they would want to save it, too, do you know what I mean? So, social media, then? Exactly. And you've seen the website. It's prehistoric. They're not on Twitter, or instagram, or even Facebook, I think. What? I'm just picturing Charlie on Facebook. Yeah. Maybe we can access an old database for a mailing list? And then Donna could help with the customer files. I could go by the hospital, and... I could come with you. If that's okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we always did work well together. Yeah, we did. A Twitter account? We'll create it. Or Molly will, because I have no idea what I'm talking about. But we an post updates on the store and Charlie. How is he doing? Well, the doctor says he's a little more responsive every day. That's great. We just want him to have something promising to come home to. Charlie would like the way you keep saying "we". We always knew things would change, but Charlie always insisted that people would still want to hold a book in their hands, you know? Turn down the pages, pass them down. That's why we kept hosting events. It's about the people, he'd always say, keeping the community together. "Community." That's it. I've got an idea. It's a little old school, but... Do you wanna come with me? Sure. Come on. All the main street businesses benefit from each other. We figured maybe local shops could help get the word out. Tell people about it, put it in a promotion or donate. Charlie and Donna are the sweetest, most wonderful people, but we were hit by the storm, too, and I really don't have anything to offer... Thanks. If anything changes... Can I ask... A lot of the flowers that people brought to put outside the bridge, they came from your shop, didn't they? Yeah. Do you think you could put aside a portion of the sales for Charlie's recovery? That I could do. That's great. Thank you. It wouldn't amount to much, even if I did donate a piece. I bet Charlie and Donna have bought a lot of stuff here over the years. Committed customers, 20 years? You some sort of businessman now? Not even close. Maybe you can't donate money, but do you have books? The store needs to be restocked. Wait, the bridge needs books? Charlie said they were reopening in about a week. Yeah, that's what he's been telling people. The bridge needs help? I'll lend a hand. I'm sure a lot of people feel that way. Well, is there somewhere we could gather up? We need it to go viral, fast. Which means tapping into people's emotions, what they love. The story of a singular bookstore, a beloved owner in trouble, everyone can relate to that. Yeah, everybody has a favorite book or bookstore. And if we can drive them to the bridge's website to share those feelings and those favorites... With links to donate, and support the bridge and Charlie's recovery... It's everything that Charlie was all about, bringing people together over their love of books. I'm gonna call my marketing department, and see if they give us some help with this. Shoot, I need a signal. You guys keep talking. She's some go-getter. Wow, it's so weird to be in here. You talked about this place so often. Does it meet your expectations? Yeah, I mean, it definitely looks like somewhere somebody would go to be discovered. Hey, has it been okay for you? You said you were on the road. Yeah, I've been making a decent living, and working with some great, great people, so... I just kind of hoped I'd be somewhere else by now, I guess. Yeah. What? Oh, nothing, I just thought that following my path might take me somewhere different, too. Maybe someplace more rewarding. It has its rewards, but I don't know, some days, it just feels kind of... Maybe when you're 18, you have all these big ideas, and then reality sets in, and... Do you really believe that? No. Being here, and helping people who need it, it just feels so much more like what I thought... It would, than being part of a big company. I just feel like I could do so much good. Are you still writing songs? Yeah, I just, uh... Started again recently. Really? Yeah. That's great... Hey, ry, you're up. Great, uh... Hey, do you want to stick around, watch the set, and then we can catch up more after? Sure. I'd love to hear you play. Great. You a fan? I'm an old fan. Molly. Hi. Molly, nice to meet you. Uh, so, yeah, um, we're right in the middle of a shift change here, so if you could settle up from before, then I'll have a new waitress who will be right here. Kristen? - Molly! - Hi! Wow, what are you doing in Franklin? Well, the bridge... Oh, sure... And Charlie, so... It's just... I thought you were in Virginia. Married, Ryan said? Uh, yeah, that didn't work out so well. I'm sorry. It's all good. I'm here. Here? At lucky? - Yeah. - Right. Wow. Oh, wow, you're engaged. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Huh. You know, I just remembered. Could you tell Ryan that I forgot about a business call I have to make to Seattle? 'Cause I work in Seattle... Actually, I... Well, live in Seattle. My life is, um... Primarily, uh... In Seattle. Yeah. So... Uh, I gotta go, but if you can just tell him, that'd be great. Yeah. Thanks, kristen. There you are. Hi. I tried calling, but... You okay? Yeah. Yeah, how was the conference? It was great. Great... Listen, I was just about to go for a workout, but do you want to take a walk? Sure. Great. I love this time of year. It makes me... I don't know, a little bold. Molly... I think you know how I've felt about you for a long time now. It's crazy that all these years later, I'm doing exactly what I want to do, with exactly the people I want to do it with. There's only one more thing that would make me even happier. Marry me. I didn't expect to be doing this in my workout clothes, and the ring is in my room, but the moment felt right, and... Oh, Preston... "Oh, Preston... yes?" I'm sorry. I love you... No. I don't... I don't feel... Yes, you do, Molly. We've been together for... But I waited, and if you didn't... What have we been doing? I should have said something earlier, I just... It's being back in Franklin, I... What is it with this place? Everything you love is in Seattle. Your father, your friends, your work, me. There's a whole life waiting for you. It's not a life that I chose. Being back here, I realize that I can't commit to a job, let alone a marriage, before I figure out what I'm supposed to be like on my own. I'm sorry. You've always known what you were meant for, and all I'm asking for is a chance to do that, too. Can you understand that? Preston? And the stupid thing is, ever since she's got to town, I've felt different. Like I have direction again. I know how to move forward. And songs? They've been flying out of me. Good ones. I have been waiting a long time for this. Ryan Kelly performing his own music. Sign. Oh, wow, I've... I've got to go right now. Thanks so much for the talk, Mickey. Hi, dad. Didn't you get my messages? Uh, no, sorry, I couldn't. You turned Preston down? What, he called you? No, I called him to ask about the conference. He was beside himself. I asked him what happened, and he told me. What are you doing? I'm trying to figure that out. Then come home. Get away from that place... No. No? No, I have to see this through. The bookstore, and Charlie and Donna... You ran away from that place after your heart was broken. I picked you up, I dusted you off. If you think I'm interested in helping you through that again, you're wrong. Look, I've put my entire life in your hands, and they're safe hands, but isn't turning 25 time for me to take control? Shouldn't I follow my dreams like mom wanted me to? But what are your dreams? Tell me. What is it you really want to do? Uh... Honey, if you don't answer, I am coming down there. Charlie's getting off the ventilator. Wait, who is that? Um... Dad, I have to call you back. Okay, Charlie. We're gonna let you breathe on your own for a few minutes. Now, it might be a little uncomfortable at first, because you'll be exercising muscles you haven't used in a few days. Edna here is gonna take your vitals, and if there's any distress, we're gonna give you back all the oxygen you need, okay? Hey, you need to breathe, too, all right? Talk to him. Tell him what's happening. You're doing great, Charlie. You're breathing! Good. Keep it up, Charlie. We're all here. Keep going, my love. Okay. That's all right. We'll do a little more each day... Yeah, and if he keeps this up, and the swelling continues to go down, we're really looking at a matter of days. In the meantime, keep up the sensory stimulation. Talk to him, play music, anything that connects him back to his life. "Teachers told my parents I'd never learn to read. "Because of you and the bridge, I teach English to special needs kids now." Hear that, Charlie? "You gave me my first book for free "when I was eight. "I traded it for another until I had my first job and could buy books on my own." "My sponsor turned me on to the bridge. Charlie, you helped me find the books I needed to heal." "We got information about adoption at the bridge. Thanks to you, we have a baby girl." There's a picture. Look. You know, Charlie and I weren't able to have kids. He said we'll just make the bridge our family. Charlie... Sweetheart... Look at what you've made. Come on, open your eyes... See what's surrounding you. So much is waiting. Christmas is waiting. That's not all. This is $500. Oh, my gosh. Hey, you knew about the bridge before me. What's your story? How did it find you? Guitar lessons. I wanted them so badly, my mom bribed me. If I read a book a week, she'd pay for them. Then I found out later, between guitar lessons and the books, it stretched our budget so far, that she was selling magazines at night on the phone after I went to bed. Wow, your mom is something else. Yeah, she's a good blackmailer. What do you say, do you want to grab a drink or something? Actually, I was gonna go back to the b&b and work on the website... Of course. Yeah, of course... But my company forbids me from doing that. It does not, however, forbid me from teaching somebody else to do that. Wait, you're not talking about... Technology? Nope, come on. Oscar the truck, here we come. Come on. So, click up here. Mm-hmm. Oh, the logo, yeah, up here on the left. Yeah, no, you're good, and then, uh, drag it down. Then you can click off, you don't need it. And then just over there, it will let you type. Oh... Yup, perfect, go ahead. Go for it. Here, let's dress it up a bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, see? Nice. Magical. And then we should probably put a counter down on the right side, yeah. Do we still have that picture of Charlie and Donna? And then we're almost done, if you just want to... Yup, and then, last key here. We're live. You did it. You did it. I just typed very badly. Okay, so... The next thing we should probably do... Uh, have mercy. It's 3:00 A.M. I'm starving. How are you not starving? All right, I think we're good. Yeah? Okay. Ready? Yup. Nice. There you go. There we go. Is that enough? It's perfect. Now, for my favorite part. Mm, it smells good. It's gonna be... Taste even better. Okay, this is... This is gonna sound crazy, but... They're really lucky, aren't they? Charlie and Donna? I mean, not what's happening right now, but... The fact that they spent their lives creating something that matters. They've inspired so many people. I think they're lucky because... They have each other. Yeah. Donna said it was love at first sight fighting over a book. Should we put that on there? Maybe. And then maybe other people could talk about their own first moments, their own love at first sight. What do you think? Um, I think that... I think it's snowing. What in the world is all this? Deliveries keep coming. We could load them in the back of my truck. We're gonna need a fleet of trucks. I don't understand, where are all these coming from? Ohio, Texas, California. This one's from Canada. Why didn't you leave them at the store? Well, no, they should be here for when... ...Charlie wakes up. 5,400. Dollars? That's just from the envelopes. But the website is up to $14,043 in just two days. No that total's wrong. It's actually $19,043. My record company heard about the bridge, and we're donating $5,000. What? You have a record company? Yeah, I'm a record exec. Oh, well, you've met Ryan Kelly, musician extraordinaire, right? Mol... What? Charlie put people together all the time. It's only fitting that this should happen in his room. Right, Donna? Right. Oh, great. She's here for the ventilator. Charlie's been breathing on his own since yesterday. All right, Charlie! $19,000 plus $5,400... ...is amazing, but... ...but still a tenth of the downpayment on a commercial property. We still need a savior, a knight riding up on a horse. The landlord doesn't realize how much the bridge's customer base has grown, or the thousands of followers we have on Facebook and Twitter. Has anybody talked to him? I nominate Molly. Oh. Yeah, sure. I just need his information. Oh, also Jenny is in charge of organizing the Christmas Carols for tomorrow, so everybody talk to her, okay? Let's go. Phewf! Hey, man, I didn't realize you were that Ryan Kelly till Molly said so. You got a sec? Yeah. Mr. fellows... Fred. Fred. I'm a businesswoman, I completely understand your issues, but the bridge is such... You have no idea how much I've loved the bridge. My wife died suddenly eight years ago and left me with three boys. I took them to the bridge for books, to get a break, find books on how to raise them. But my eldest is about to go to college. If they can't rebuild... That's my income, too. But the money keeps coming in... Is it enough? For repairs? For the downpayment. Sir, they're booksellers. You know they may never have that kind of money. It's my biggest hope that they come up with it, but without a guarantee... It's a very nice thing that you're doing, but I can't wait. I am so sorry. Okay. I understand. Thanks for your time. You wanted to stay. I know, I just... I'm playing backup at amateur night four hours a week. That's the only thing out there. Do you know how many musicians would kill for this gig? I know how many have your gifts. Zero. And you'd give it up to wind up exactly where you are in a year, again? You were moving forward. What's the issue? What if what I've got is as far as I'm going to get? How will you know if you keep running away? Honey, all I want is for you to be happy, but I taught you to grab life with both hands. "Go to Italy." Yes. No matter how long it takes to get there. Ryan, show people who you are. Or does this have something to do with Molly? We both know that's why you went on the road in the first place. But with her or without her, it's time for you to decide, are you going to step up, or not? I'm on break. You don't have to keep bringing me things. But thank you. How are you holding up? Well... You went through it with tom. I didn't go through this. You know, I didn't mean that, I'm sorry... No, I meant, I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through. I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for you and Charlie. You had faith. Might have made it easier for you. I've been thinking. Maybe for you, crossing that line to faith feels like betraying something. Something in you hasn't forgiven, or forgotten. But this isn't about you. It's about Charlie. And if you can open up, and ask for things for him... Someone will listen? Someone's always listening. And prayer and faith aren't necessarily found in houses of worship. They're in your heart. And you've always had that faith in Charlie. Maybe, if you wanted, you could access it that way. Thank you. You came. To your debut at lucky? Are you kidding? Well, it's amateur night, so don't expect too much. Okay, first of all, you are not an amateur, and I've already heard your music, so... How do you feel? I'm petrified, yeah. I play backup, so it's... Not anymore. You're up. Oh, boy. Hey, mol... Merry Christmas Eve-Eve. Hey, everyone! Let's have a big lucky welcome for Ryan Kelly! So, I'm Ryan Kelly... Whoo! Thanks. It's good to see you guys, too. So, you probably all heard about the bridge bookstore, and its owner, Charlie bartons, who was in an accident last week. Ever since, I've been writing songs about a bookseller and his patrons each one with a story to tell. But this was the first one I wrote. It's about lost love. ♪ Been out chasing the stars ♪ and playing this guitar ♪ but every highway seemed to circle back home ♪ ♪ and lonely got hard ♪ while I was searching for something ♪ ♪ in the end it was you all along ♪ ♪ girl, it was just you and me ♪ and a handful of dreams ♪ but life had something else in mind ♪ ♪ you turned on the lights ♪ and the path was so clear ♪ but that was once upon a time ♪ ♪ so many lessons learned ♪ so many twists and turns ♪ sometimes, it's hard to have faith... ♪ I'd walk on hot coals for Charlie, I'd jump out of an airplane... Beg for mercy. So please... I'm following his lead here. Please... Answer my prayer. ♪ Once upon a time... ♪ Whoo! Ryan Kelly, everyone! Local boy. Ryan Kelly! Donna... Come quick. Charlie moved his hand. Ryan... That was incredible. I've been bottling it up. You are a songwriter. You're amazing, you know that? Nothing's changed, because... Music just flows out of me when I'm around you. What? Are you happy, Molly? Has your 10-year plan worked out? You probably don't remember that video we made... Actually, I watch it every December. I know you're following the life plan that you had, I just have to ask... You're not wearing your ring, did something change, or...? Ryan, listen, if I tell you something... Hey, did you hear that crowd? Did you hear that crowd? Yeah, yeah, it was, uh... You can come back here anytime. I mean, if that pacific rim tour doesn't keep you away from us. Great set. Great set... You're going back on the road? No, no... No, it's okay. Ryan, it's okay. I'm happy for you. What were you about to say? I've got to get out of here after this, um... To pack, and I'm going back to Seattle tomorrow. It's Christmas Eve. To your fiancé. Right. Bye, Ryan. You hung up on me. Yeah. Molly... I told you I'd come down... What do you want? You want me home? I'm flying home tomorrow. It's Christmas Eve. You don't talk to me like that. No, I don't. I do everything I'm told. I hop to, that's the kind of girl I am. What's come over you? Except now. I quit. You quit? I quit callens media. I don't want to be ceo anymore. Good night, dad. Thanks for coming. Have you been drinking? I'm completely clear. I'm just, I'm done. I can't follow the plan anymore. What is going on with you? Tonight, I went to this bar, called lucky, and Ryan, he... - Ryan? - He followed through. He played his own music in this bar that he always... This is about Ryan? Would you just listen? He followed his heart, and... He was ridiculously amazing, and the look on his face was just... He... By doing this, he became the person that he was meant to be. Wait, you're giving everything up because of him? Look, I'm not with him, okay? He doesn't want me, and it's about more than that. It's about what he inspired in me. It's about who I'm supposed to be. I really need you to understand this. Dad, I've always done everything you wanted. I learned the business. I transferred from belmont to Stanford after my first semester... That was your choice. Dad, please... You said you had nothing left after that boy broke your heart. He knew that you were better off with Preston, or he wouldn't have done it. Dad... Wait, how could he... Ryan knew that you belonged with Preston, and that is why he broke it off. How would he have known? I never talked to him about Preston. The only way he would have known would have been if... That Christmas Eve... What did you do? I protected you. You called him? What did you say? I said you had a life in Seattle, and he wasn't part of it. Why? So I could come back and run a corporation and marry a man that I don't love? You did this! So you would have the right life! How would you know what that is when you never let me find out? He probably thought I never loved him at all. Molly... No, no, no, no. We are so done. You are going to install Preston as ceo, and hand over my inheritance to me, or I swear I will leave Seattle for good. I couldn't change the inheritance even if I wanted to. And if you don't take over as ceo, you're never going to see that money. I get that you wanted to save this bookstore, or whatever lark it is that you're on, but you're never going to be this store's white knight. Yes, I will. Watch me. Molly... You said you did all this for me. You did this for yourself. You ruined my life, for you. Molly. Hi. I know it's late, but I have a proposition for you. I don't think i want to run my dad's company, and I'm not even sure i want to stay in Seattle. Molly... Hi. Can I come in? I thought about everything you said to me, and I tried to answer for myself what was true. I wanted to make your life the best it possibly could be... - Dad... - Please... Let me finish. But I went about it the wrong way. The thing with Ryan, I never should have done that. You're entitled to make your own decisions, and your own mistakes. I took that away from you, and I'm sorry. But don't resign. I don't want you away from me, and I don't want you angry with me. You're my daughter, I love you. So, tell me how to fix this. I found something, being here. It was a piece of me I was never going to find in Seattle, because I was away from you. Okay. When I came home that Christmas I was mourning that as well as Ryan. You know what else I figured out, being here? I'm really good at connecting the dots to make good things happen for people. So, what if I stay in the company... Yes... ...not as ceo. I want to head up the callens foundation. But there is no callens foundation. There should be. We should be balancing out the hard business we do by reaching out to others, forming a foundation. I want to do that. I think I would be amazing at it, and it would make my life feel complete. So... What do you say? I look forward to you coming home. I have a couple things to wrap up first. - Okay. - Okay. Love you. Bye. Love you, too. Thanks. Charlie's going to love this. Hey. There you are. This is going to be incredible. Come on. I'm going to meet you guys in there. Okay. Come on, guys. Hey. ♪ Hark the herald angels sing... ♪ You hear that, Charlie? ♪ Glory to... It must be some church group caroling for the holidays. You love Carols, Charlie. Come on, open your eyes. ♪ Joyful all ye nations rise... ♪ Come on, Charlie. ♪ Join the triumph of skies... ♪ With angelic host proclaim ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ hark the herald angels sing ♪ glory to the newborn king... You're not gonna believe this, Charlie has been moving all morning, and this whole time, he's been squeezing my hand. Charlie? Charlie, are you there? Charlie? It's me. It's me. It's me... Donna. Yes! Yes! Yes... " I'll go get Dr. mats. Okay, Charlie, you had a car accident, and... And you've been out of it now for over a week, and all these people, they've been helping and praying, Charlie, for you. Hi, Charlie, I'm Dr. mats. We've been working together the last week. Looks like you've got some fans here. Yeah. How you feeling, Charlie? Like a kid at Christmas. We've got some presents for you if you want. Is that okay? Yeah, I think it's all right. They're all yours. They're all books, Charlie. People sent them to the bridge when they heard what happened. Am I... am I dreaming? No. Ryan and Molly, and everyone, insisted on bringing them here so they'd be here when you woke up. And people sent money, Charlie, from everywhere. Thousands and thousands of dollars. It's marked urgent. What? What's this? An anonymous source purchased the bridge? What? We still have a week. No, wait a minute, there's a letter. "Dear Charlie, "it came to my attention "you and the bridge have fallen on hard times. "The time I spent at the bridge "was the best of my life. "So I bought the building. "And because I once saw you "sell a book to a single mother "for a penny, "from now on, "and for as long as you want to run the bridge, "that will be your annual lease. One penny." Oh, Charlie... "Because the truth is, "I would do anything for you, sir. Anything that was right." We don't have to close. We can reopen the bridge... And we have all the books, and the money we need to repair it. Christmas came. Your family came. You were right. God's not done with us yet. Airport. Molly. I couldn't do it. I couldn't get on a plane, and... Leave Franklin. What is it? Molly... I'm not engaged. I was never engaged. I lied, and I wore my mother's engagement ring because I thought you'd be happily married to kristen, and I-I just couldn't stand... I'm sorry for misleading you. But you're not engaged? What about the ring that you... I sold it to put a down payment on the building for Donna and Charlie. That... Christmas Eve... Eve... My dad called you, didn't he? What did he say? He said a lot of things. He played a recording, a conversation that you had with Preston that night we were together. You said that you loved him and were going to Seattle... No, no, it's not... Preston was calling from my dad's office. My dad records all of his phone calls. I... I was actually telling Preston that I just love him as a friend. And I guess my dad wanted me back so badly, that he cut that part out. But you... Had those feelings. I never stopped having those feelings. But you wanted kristen. You said forever. I just did that so you could live the life that you wanted. The life I wanted is here. From the minute I got here and I met you, I never wanted to leave. All that time? You meant it? You couldn't leave Franklin? I quit. I'm not gonna be ceo. When? Last night. We're forming a foundation that I'm going to lead, using callens media. What? A brand-new foundation could be run from anywhere, right? But you're going back on the road, aren't you? Actually, there's... This girl... ...who reminded me who I was, and who I wanted to be, and I wrote her so many songs, that a music executive signed me to a publishing deal. He thinks we have enough for a whole album. Ryan! I'm staying in Franklin, and I'm gonna write songs. You're three years early. The 10-year plan. You wanted to write songs for a living. And you wanted to make a difference in the world. So, we made it three years early because of you. Because of you. Oh, my. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi! Doc... Luther... Hey. Aw, edna. Good to have you back, Charlie. Thank you. You came. I wanted to see what the fuss was about. All right, everybody. Together with me, as we've been this entire time. Do it with me on three. One... Two! Three! Thanks, Ryan. I want to invite you all inside, to the new bridge. Come, with us. You're gonna love this! Merry Christmas! I brought you something. Dad... Dad... "Following her dreams," huh? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Thanks, dad. I love you. I love you, too. Come on inside, see what your daughter did. You two go ahead. I'll catch up. Hi. That was really good. I know. Oh, it's really coming down. You got some in your hair. Hey. You'll like this, but I know a better one for you. You're gonna love it. Come on.
