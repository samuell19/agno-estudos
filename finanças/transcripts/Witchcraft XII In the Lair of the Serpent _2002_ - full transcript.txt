(dramatic instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) - Are you ready to call it a night? - What are you talking about? Hey, I'm just getting started. - It's 1:30, Jeff. - One more drink? I'm buying. (car engine running) (upbeat instrumental music) (cheering and clapping) (glass clinking) And to growing old gracefully. - You're 26. - But I feel like an old man. - You're an old dork. (laughing) - We should do this more often. - What, go out to clubs? - No, hang out. I hardly ever get to see you anymore. - I know. This new job at the college is a little more than I'd planned for. I mean, there's so much to learn, and the hours are totally insane, and, Jeff, put down the lamp. Hello? (glass clattering) Shit, shit. - Sorry, Cindy. - And you weren't even listening to me? - I'll get some paper towels. - No, let's just go. Let's just go. - No, just stay here. I'm gonna be right back. (mumbling) (upbeat instrumental music) - I saw what happened. - That was an accident. - I hope your girlfriend's not too mad. (laughing) - She's not my girlfriend. - No? - No, it's my sister. - How cute. - I'd better be going. - What's the rush? (cheering) (laughing) - Are you for real? - Is this real enough for you? (cheering) (booing) (gentle instrumental music) - Jeff. Jeff? Jeff? Jeff. (insects chirping) Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. (car engine running) (siren ringing) - You live here? - Yeah, something wrong? - Just kind of industrial. - I need a lot of space for my work. - Really, what kind of work you do? - I'm a sculptor. I work with metals. - Can I see it? (foreboding instrumental music) That's nice. - Are you coming or not? - It's kind of cold in here. - You've never done this before, have you? - Of course I have. - You wanna go back? I can take you back. - Come on, Tisa. - You don't have to if you don't want to. (gentle instrumental music) - What's that for? - You can touch, but you can't look. - No fair. - Play by my rules, or don't play at all. - It's kind of tight. - Don't worry. (upbeat instrumental music) - What the, (dramatic instrumental music) (grunting) No. (yelling) (car engine running) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Cindy, it's Will. - Hey, you're in town. I thought you weren't supposed to be here till this afternoon. - Flight got in a little early. How are you doing? - Just trying to keep sane. It's not easy. - Everything okay? - Yeah, I guess. I still can't believe-- - Yeah, I know. Hey, you gonna be around for a little while? - Yeah, why? - I thought I'd come on by, and we can grab something to eat, if you feel up to it. - I really don't feel like going anywhere or doing anything, but if you come by here, I can make us something. - You don't have to do that. - No, really, I'd love to. Do you remember how to get here? (gentle instrumental music) (car engine running) - What the fuck is this, Tom? - It looks like some sort of cult thing, yeah, maybe Satanists, possibly witchcraft. I got some guys researching that symbol. - And? - Nothing yet. - Well, you better find out something before the next murder happens. - How do you know there's gonna be one? - This isn't just some garden variety serial killer. Whoever did this is following some ancient ritual that tells them how and when to kill. They'll try and do this again, only next time, you'd better be there. Who else has seen these? - Nobody outside the precinct. - Good, I don't want this thing getting out to the press. They love making celebrities out of these assholes. - Don't worry about it, Chief. I'll take care of it. (gentle instrumental music) - Lord, we commit the soul of your humble servant, Jeffrey Rodrick Lawton, and commit his body to the ground. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in the name of the father, son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. - Thanks. So how's Seattle treating you? - Okay, I guess. My practice is working out. We have a lot of new clients. - How long has it been since you've come back here? - Last year, remember? - Yeah, you came back for Jeff's birthday. - Cindy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring that up. - It's okay. It's okay. It's not your fault. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. God, I miss him so much. I just can't believe it that he's gone, and I keep expecting him to come in the door and tell me that it's just all a big joke, you know, but it's not. He's gone, and it's my fault. - Come on, Cindy. How can you say that? - Well, the last time that I saw him, we were in this club, and he went to the bathroom, and he didn't come back. I finally went to go look for him, and that's when I saw him leave with this woman. - You never told me that. What woman are you talking about? - I don't know who she was. - Did you tell this to the police? - Yeah, yeah, course I did. They said, "Not much to go on." - Did they ever say anything about Jeff? - Not really. - After they found him. - No actually. It almost seemed like they were holding something back. - Do you remember the name of the detective in charge? - Yeah, Graves. - Tom Grieves? - Yeah, that's it. Where you going? - Tom and I go way back. He may be able to help us on this. - I don't want you getting involved in this. - I already am. (upbeat instrumental music) (cheering) (metal clanging) (laughing) - Oh, you are something else. What'd you say your name was again? - Kyra. - What's that short for? - It's short for I wanna fuck your brains out. (laughing) - Let's do it right here. - I prefer something a little more private. - How about my place? - I was thinking about mine. - Whatever makes you happy. - What brings you out at this late hour, Will? - Leaving town tomorrow, thought we could catch up. - Come on, Will. You expect me to believe that? I am a cop, remember? It's about Jeff Lawton, isn't it? - What do you know about Jeff? - Well, I know he's dead, and I saw you at the funeral. - What were you doing at the funeral? - My job. What about you? - Jeff and I've been friends since high school. He and his sister are two of my best friends. - Sorry, I didn't know. I wish there was something I could tell you about-- - How did he die? - He was murdered. - Oh, come on, Tom. Stop feeding me that shit. You know something. Tell me. I promise it won't leave this room. - Oh, yeah, I know you, Will. I don't want you running around with some badge acting like a detective. - Something you've never seen before, isn't it? (gentle instrumental music) Something awful, something that scares the shit out of you when you think about it. - Was nice seeing you, Will. - Anytime. (gentle instrumental music) - This is too much. - I'm just getting started. Do you like music? - Anything but country. (upbeat instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) (metal clicking) What was that? I know what I saw. - You're seeing things, baby. - I knew this was too good to be true. - Come on. Let's finish what we started. - I don't know what you got going on here, but I'm not interested, crazy bitch. (dramatic instrumental music) Fuck, man. Fuck. (metal clattering) (footsteps) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (energy whirring) (groaning) (gentle instrumental music) - To growing old gracefully. - [Cindy] You're 26. - But I feel like an old man. We should do this more often. - Jeff, put down the lamp, hello. (glass shattering) (wood thudding) Will? Will, is that you? (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (grunting) Oh my God, Will. - What are you doing? - I thought I heard somebody come in. - Yeah, it was me. I was trying not to wake you. - I called out. Didn't you hear me? Oh God, I am so sorry. (groaning) Let me get you something for your shoulder. Come here. (mumbling) - Oh my God. (grunting) - Let me get something. I insist. - It's okay. Just no. - Let me get something. Let me see it. - Come on, Cindy. It's fine. - This is no time to be stubborn. Oh. - It's just a bruise. It'll be healed by morning. - Shut up. You always did like arguing. (laughing) How'd your meeting go? - You were right. Tom's holding something back. I don't know why, but I'm gonna find out. - No, it's okay, Will. Don't push it. I mean, I'm sure the police are doing everything that they can. - That's the problem. I'm sure they are too, but it's not enough. - Well, what else can we do? - Got a few ideas. I'm gonna stick around here for a little while and find out what's going on. - Will, you know, I don't want you getting in trouble though, so. - I'm not leaving until I find this out. - Whatever you find out, it's not gonna bring him back. - I know, but Jeff was your brother, and he was my best friend, and we all miss him. (plastic crinkling) - [Cindy] I think it's going down. - Let's get some sleep. It's been a hell of a day. Where do you keep your blankets? - Down the hallway. - Okay. - No, you stay here, and we'll be right back. (plastic crinkling) How's this? - Fine. - You ever think about the way it used to be, all of us together? - Yeah. (gentle instrumental music) - You think about me, about us? I do. You sure you wanna sleep out here tonight? (upbeat instrumental music) - Just like the last guy. - He's cut up the same, probably with the same weapon. This facial expression is virtually the same too. - Yeah, well, you'd look like that too if someone cut you up like this. - Whatever the cause of death, it had nothing to do with these wounds. - What do you mean? - On the last victim, the cuts were postmortem. Somebody killed him, then they cut him up. - Well, so how did he die? - Hard to say. My first inclination was a heart attack, but it looks as if his vital fluids have all been drained, like someone sucked the life right out of him. - This is crazy. I mean, how could they-- - I don't know. I've never seen anything like it. Whoever's doing this, they have more on their mind than just murder. (gentle instrumental music) (car engine running) (birds chirping) - Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. - Will. I thought you were leaving town. - Cindy's still pretty upset, so I thought I'd stay for a few extra days. - Well, what are you doing down here? - Same thing as you, probably. - Oh? - There's been another murder. - What makes you so sure? - I can see it in your face. You always were easy to read, Tom. - Why don't you stay out of this, Will? - I can't. I already know too much. - Oh yeah? Like what? - Jeff left the club with a blond. - That's old news, Will. - They left in a blue pick up truck. License plate was B, V, O, 7, M, E. - How do you know that? - Cindy and I were talking about this last night, and it suddenly came to her. Check it out, Tom. It'll take you two minutes. - You check this out, Will. Now we've been friends for a long time, but if I catch you snooping around here again, I'll arrest you. (car engine running) Hey, Owen, Tom, listen, check out a vehicle ID for me, will you? Ohio, Bravo, Victor, Oscar, seven, Mike, Echo. It's just a hunch. Car belongs to a prostitute who's been missing for months. Her name is Tisa Andrews. - Yeah, that's her. - Are you sure? - Well, she looks a little weird here, but yeah, I'm sure. She's the one who left the club that night with Jeff. - Well, I also found this in her room. Have you seen that symbol before? - Doesn't look familiar, no. - Whoever killed Jeff carved that in his chest. Same with the other guy. (gentle instrumental music) I'm guessing she's our killer. - Bring me in on this, Tom. Come on, you've done okay by me in the past. - Look, Chief will never go for it. - Come on, Tom. There's a killer out there. The more time we spend talking about it, the more time they have to find another victim. I mean, they're probably doing it right now. How much longer do you want this to go on? - No way, forget it. - Look, I know what you're thinking. - I'm surprised you even had the nerve to bother me with this. - Will knows about the murders, about that symbol. - So does half the city. Have you seen this? - I'm just trying to help out. - Well, we don't need your kind of help, Spanner. - It's gonna happen again. - Really? What makes you so sure? Are you the killer? - Let's just say that I know what we're dealing with, and you don't. - That's right. I forgot. You're a psychic. Psychotic's more like it, huh? Look, you may have him fooled, but I've been around long enough to know the reason why you got kicked out of the DA's office. Didn't you know, Tom? Spanner here is into black magic, thinks he's got some kind of contact with the supernatural. - Excuse me, Chief? - Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here? - This is pretty important, Chief. We just got a call from a lady in Smith Grove. They found another body. Looks like the same guy. - Thanks. This meeting's over, Grieves. (gentle instrumental music) - I'm going too. - The hell you are. - Oh, come on, Chief. We need all the help we can get on this one. - Partners, huh? Alright, go ahead. I never heard about it. Grieves, if anything gets screwed up, it's your ass. Now get out of my office. - You got it. (gentle instrumental music) (car engine running) What's all that talk about black magic? - No, he doesn't understand a fucking thing. - Me neither. You wanna clue me in? - In college, I did a lot of research into certain taboo religions, like Voodoo, or Wiccan. - What? - Witchcraft, I want to see if there's any truth to it. - Is that what we're dealing with here? - Maybe, or maybe something a lot worse. (upbeat instrumental music) (wood thudding) (metal clattering) (water running) (yelling) - Oh my God. - I'm sorry. - I thought you were somebody. - Are you okay? - I'm just a little spooked. I thought I saw somebody watching me earlier when I was running. - You sure? What'd they look like? - I don't know. It was probably just the neighbor. What are you doing back so early? Did you find something? - Not yet. We're going back out tonight, gonna check out the clubs. - Let me come. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? I'm the only one that's seen this woman. - She's seen you too, Cindy. I just can't risk it. - Promise me that you will find them. - I will, for you and for Jeff. (gentle instrumental music) - [Woman] Easy, boy. - Wow, so that's it? - Were you expecting more than that? - No, I just thought, when can I see you again? (laughing) What's so funny? Man, you are one freaky chick. (car engine running) (dramatic instrumental music) - How many times are you gonna go around this block? - As many times as it takes. (car engine running) - [Will] Here, pull over here. - [Tom] Do you see her? - No, no, I wanna get out. I think I'll have better luck. - You going inside? - Yeah. Park over there. I'll be back in about five minutes. (upbeat instrumental music) (yelling and cheering) (insects chirping) (cheering and clapping) (upbeat instrumental music) (insects chirping) - This the spot, or what? - My car's down the street. You wanna go? - Let's go then. - You. - Fuck. - Who the fuck are you? - I just saved your life. (dramatic instrumental music) - You asshole. - Shit. (car engine running) Freeze. Get down. - Stay right there. - Get down now. Drop it. (insects chirping) Hey, drop it. (gun firing) (wood clattering) (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (gun firing) Well, it's over, Will. Thank God it's over. (insects chirping) (birds chirping) - You know, I hate to say it, but I'm glad she's dead. - I just hope we got the right person. - Well, who else could it be? I mean, she was with him. She took him away. - We still don't know who killed Jeff. It could be anybody. - She did it. - I hope so. - I can do that. - I wish I didn't have to leave. - I know. I just thought-- - I'll come back. - When? - I don't know. I'll call you when I get back to Seattle. (phone ringing) - Hello? Tom, yeah, he's still here. - Tom. - What is it? What happened? - They found another body. - Oh God. - Tom wants me to come down and take a look at it. - What are you gonna do? - I can't leave now, not until this is finished. (gentle instrumental music) (car engine running) - We're doing everything we can, I assure you. Yes, sir, I'm aware of that. Yes, I know. Know who that was? Chester Atkins, that's Mayor Atkins to you two schmucks. He's ready to tear me a new one because of this mess. - Will and I have been working overtime on this thing. - Then maybe you should take a rest, a permanent one. Your investigation hasn't turned up shit. - What about that girl last night? - Oh, the one whose brains you blew all over the street? She isn't much help to us dead. - Yeah, but she was connected to this, Cindy Lawton ID-ed her. She was wearing the symbol. - Yeah, yeah, I heard it already, but that doesn't bring us any closer to finding the son of a bitches who did this. For all I know, you two killed some poor, dumb girl who was just trying to hustle some guy for a back alley blowjob. I got seven dead bodies and not a single suspect, and what are you still doing here? I thought your ass would be back in Seattle by now. - Tom called me, thought I could still be of some help, so I stayed. - Don't bother. As of now, you're both off the case. - What? You gotta be kidding. - Do I look like I'm kidding? I'm putting Boyle and Harris on it. Maybe they'll come up with something more substantial instead of wasting civilians. - Look, Chief, we just need one more day on this. We're this close. - You must think I'm really stupid, Grieves. - We know who's behind these killings, and we know where to find them. - So why didn't you bring them up here to meet me? - We have to wait until tonight. That's when they come out, and that's when you take them. - What are you gonna do, Spanner? Wave your magic wand and cast a spell on them? Alright, fine, I'll give you two one more night, but if you fuck up, I'm telling you right now, I'm putting you on suspension and you on the first plane out of here forever. Got it? (gentle instrumental music) - [Tom] Have you seen that symbol before? - Doesn't look familiar, no. - [Tom] Whoever killed Jeff carved that in his chest. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man] Cindy Lawton? - Yeah. - [Man] Tell your friend to mind his own business, or you'll both end up just like your brother. - Who is this? - [Man] Don't forget, Cindy. We're watching you. (gentle instrumental music) - Where'd they find Jeff's body? - The auto scrapyard here. - [Will] And the second victim? - Here. The third was in a parking lot on Clifford here. - And the one we saw today was right here. (gentle instrumental music) - Shit. - There's gonna be more murders, Tom, at least two more from the looks of this. Then the ritual's complete. - Even if you're right, Will, this only shows us where they dump the bodies. It doesn't show us where they pick the men up or where they kill them. - That's why we have to go out again to the clubs tonight. (gentle instrumental music) Cindy? Cindy, you home? - Looking for something. - What are you doing with that? - I should ask you the same thing. - It's just a book. - It's a spell book, Will, and what the hell are you doing with it? - It's something I've had for a long time. If you just let me explain-- - I can read what's in here. It's witchcraft. It's black magic. - It's not black magic. - What the hell are you doing with this shit? - I've been into it since college. I never told you and Jeff. It was kind of a secret. - You practice magic. - Cindy, please, I-- - Get away from me. For all I know, you've had something to do with this whole fucking thing. - Listen to what you're saying. I've been trying to find out who killed Jeff and all those other people. If it wasn't for this book and these spells, we wouldn't have gotten as far as we have. - What about this, then? You told Tom that you had never seen it before. - [Will] It's a symbol of the Order of Shades. - [Cindy] Order of what? - The Order of Shades was a society of magicians back in the 1600s. They committed human sacrifice in hopes of gaining supernatural powers. - Well, why didn't you tell us this before? - At first, I wasn't sure. Plus, I didn't want to upset you. Besides, neither of you would have believed me, but now I'm sure. I mean, it's the same, the snake symbol, the murders, everything. - I don't understand. You're talking about something that's over 400 years-- - I know it's hard to believe, but it's real, and it's happening here tonight. - Oh my God, Will, I'm so scared. Somebody called a couple of hours ago. They knew you were here, and they said that if you didn't stay away, that we'd both end up dead. Oh my God. - Cindy, we have to stop them before they complete the ritual. - How are you gonna do that? - Tom and I have a plan. - Right, and you're gonna leave me out while you guys go out and risk your life again. Well, not this time. - I told you before, Cindy. It's too-- - I know, I know. It's too dangerous. Well, I'm tired of being on the outside of this thing. Whether you like it or not, I am involved. (car engine running) - You're late. - Cindy wanted to come. - So what'd you do? - Put a spell on her. - You're a funny guy, Will. Well, I hope your plan is better than your joke. - Having second thoughts? - What the hell? Chief's gonna put my ass in a sling anyway, and you're going home tomorrow. - I'm not going anywhere till this is over. - Whatever. Let's get this done. (tape ripping) You and Cindy got something going on? - We used to date back in college. - I mean now. - Yeah. - Well, she seems like a pretty nice girl. I'd bang her. - So you done with this? - Say something. - You are a fuckwad. - Alright, get out of here. Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? - I think I know what they're looking for. - Yeah, well, you be careful with that mic. We lose that, you're on your own. (car engine running) (upbeat instrumental music) (cheering and yelling) (insects chirping) (upbeat instrumental music) (cheering and yelling) - [Rana] Hey, is this seat taken? - No, go right ahead. - [Rana] You're not alone, are you? - Not anymore. - I mean, you look anxious like you were looking for somebody. I'm Rana. - Will. (gentle instrumental music) I'm sorry. Would you like something to drink? - Sure, that'd be great. - What are you having? - I'll have what you're having. - I'll be right back. (upbeat instrumental music) (insects chirping) - I'm here. - [Will] I've got one. - Are you sure? - [Will] I'm sure. She's wearing the symbol. - Alright, I'm coming in. - [Will] No, no, wait. I'm gonna pull a (mumbling). - Okay, okay, you keep her there. I'm watching your back. - [Will] Will do. (upbeat instrumental music) (cheering and clapping) - Here's to your chance encounters. So you live around here? - Actually, I'm just passing through. I'm here for the convention. - Which one? - Real Estate Developers of Southern California. - Sounds interesting. - Yeah, right, just a bunch of stiffs in suits trying to figure out where to build the next mini-mall. Just what America needs, right? - You don't seem like a stiff to me. Wanna go somewhere? - What have you got in mind? - A little out of the way place where we can get to know each other, hang out. What do you say? - Sure. (insects chirping) So you gonna tell me where we're going? - Can't do that. - Really? Why not? - It'd ruin the surprise. - [Will] What surprise are you talking about? - [Rana] You'll find out. (car engine running) - So do I pay you now or-- - You think I do this for money? Don't be insulting. I do this for the thrill, for the danger, but you're not dangerous, are you? - I might be. (car engine running) (gentle instrumental music) - So make yourself at home. - You got any light? I like to see what I'm doing, if you know what I mean. - Sure. (gentle instrumental music) Here, let me help you with that. - Oh, I got that. - Okay, whatever. Now it's your turn. - You got a bathroom? (laughing) I've been drinking, you know, and-- - You're not chickening out on me, are you? I might have to kill you. Right down the hall, first door on the right. You might wanna take this with you. Don't be too long, now. - Thanks. (gentle instrumental music) Tom. Tom, can you hear me? I'm in a warehouse with the girl. (mumbling) Fuck. - I'm tired of waiting, Will. - Oh, I'm ready to go. - Good, 'cause I want you now. (upbeat instrumental music) (car engine running) See, I told you that wouldn't hurt. - I've got to go. - What's the rush? Come on, baby. - Some other time. - Stay a little longer. - No. Later. - Suit yourself. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (energy crackling) - Who are you? Do you really think you can stop me? (yelling) - Freeze. Let him go now, you fuck. (gun firing) (coughing) (grunting) Will, come on. You alright? - Tom, don't go there. Don't, don't. He's not moving. Tom, oh, shit. Tom, let's go. Tom, let's go. Now, Tom, goddammit. - [Tom] What the fuck is this thing? - Goddammit, let's go. (gun firing) Come on. (energy whirring) - No. (yelling) (energy whirring) - Tom. Tom. (dramatic instrumental music) Fuck, Tom. Fuck. (brakes squealing) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Burns, it's Will. - Where the fuck are you? - You have to come down to the warehouse now. - I haven't heard anything from you guys all night. Put Tom on the phone. - I can't. - Why the hell not? - He's dead. - Look, if this is your way of saying you haven't found anything-- - Get your men together. Come down to the warehouse on Fifth and River. I'll meet you there. (gentle instrumental music) The body was right here. He must have hid it or something, or maybe he came back and took it. - Search the building. You wanna tell me what's really going on here? - Last night, we found one of the girls. We followed her here, then moved in. They killed Tom, and tried to kill me-- - Wait a second. The girl you're following killed Tom? - Not the girl, someone else. The girls aren't doing the killing. They're working for someone, someone with the power to make them kill, even kill themselves. The girls are just slaves. - So it's some kind of cult thing, like Jim Jones or Manson. - No, Manson was just a man. We're dealing with something completely different here. - All I know is that you and Tom both owe me an explanation. Now go home, and clean yourself up. We'll take care of it here. (car engine running) (gentle instrumental music) - Cindy. - Who's there? - It's me. Open up. - [Cindy] I don't want you in here. - Cindy, open the door. I can explain. - I don't wanna see you again. - Please, please. - What do you want? - I have to tell you what happened. - I know what happened. You put a spell on me so that I wouldn't wake up, you bastard. - It was for your own good. I was only trying to protect you. - Protect me from what? - Tom's dead. - What? - He's dead, Cindy. They killed him. - How do you know that? - I was there. I saw it. I saw everything. It's worse than I thought. It's not even human. - Not human, what are you talking about? - The Order of Shades, it's real, Cindy. It's not just something from an old book. This guy's going around, and he's killing people as human sacrifices. That's how he gets his power. - I don't believe you. You're crazy. - They just have one more sacrifice to complete the ritual tonight. - Well, then, why don't we just call the police? - The police won't help us. Nobody will. It's up to us. - What can we do? - There's a few things I'll need to prepare, but we can't do it here. They know we're here. They know about me. They know everything. We have to leave. - Where are we going? - I'll figure it out on the way. We just can't stay here any longer. I need to pick up a few things from the bedroom, and then we can-- (wood thudding) - Open up. It's the police. (dramatic instrumental music) Spanner, we know you're in there. Open up, or we're coming in. (dramatic instrumental music) (car engine running) Shit. (gentle instrumental music) - The Order of Shades committed human sacrifices to the serpent god Malius. Victims were typically seduced and then killed by the high priest. Six victims were chosen at random with the final victim sacrificed at midnight. (phone ringing) Hello? - It's Will. - I can't talk to you. - Please, Cindy, don't hang up. - Did you kill him? - What? - The police found Tom's body. They think you did it. - Come on, Cindy. You know me. - I thought I knew you. - No, I know you're scared, but I didn't kill anyone. This whole thing's a set up. Now, please, listen. I need your help. - I can't. They're after you. - In the bedroom, my suitcase, did they take anything? - No. - Good, I'm gonna need some of that stuff. Now I'm gonna come by the house tonight. - Will, hold on. - Just promise me you'll be there. Cindy, I love you. (gentle instrumental music) Cindy? (wood thudding) Cindy? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Man] Will Spanner? - Who is this? - [Man] You know who this is. We have Cindy here with us. - What do you want? - [Man] If you value her life, you'll come to us. - Let me talk to her. - [Man] I make the demands here, not you. Come to us now, or Cindy dies, and come alone. We'll know if you try anything. - Alright, I'm coming. Just don't hurt her. - [Man] Look forward to seeing you, Will. (gentle instrumental music) - You must be Will. The master is waiting. Follow me. (gentle instrumental music) (footsteps) After you. - Hi, Will. Nice to see you. - Where's Cindy? (laughing) I want to see her now. Cindy. (screaming) - [Cindy] No. - Calm yourself, Will. I could kill her in a heartbeat. - Let her go. - I will, but first, you must submit to your fate. Kneel before me. - Fuck you. I'm not doing shit until Cindy's out of here. - Fair enough, but I have what I want. What do you have, Will? - I'll snap her fucking neck. (laughing) (mumbling) - Will, Will, Will. - [Will] You think I'm kidding? (gentle instrumental music) - They're nothing to me, Will. They'll do anything I tell them, even enjoy their own death. (moaning) (screaming) But I need you to complete the ritual. That's why I summoned you. You will be the final sacrifice. (ropes creaking) (panting) - No, no, Will. - Who the hell are you? - Don't you know yet, Will? I've been around for ages, much longer than you. - Bullshit. You're just some wannabe warlock, pissed off at the world. - You're a fool to talk like that, Will. Do you want to know who I am? I'll show you. (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) I am Malius. For centuries, I've waited for this moment. Tonight, we begin a new era, an eternity of darkness. - Are you done yet? - Usually I'll wait till they are dead to do this, but in your case, I'll make an exception. (screaming) (panting) (growling) Oh, don't die yet, Will, not yet. I want to savor this moment. (grunting) Goodbye, Will. - [Cindy] No. (growling) (screaming) - [Malius] Kill her now. (grunting) - No. (energy whirring) Oh my God, Will. - Will, you'll never leave here alive. The ritual must be completed. The final sacrifice must be made. - Cindy, don't look. - She cannot resist me, Will. - No, Cindy. - Come to me, Cindy. (growling) - I love you. - [Malius] Come to me now. (growling) (energy whirring) (screaming) (metal clattering) (panting) (gentle instrumental music) - Oh, God, Will.
