* Bye baby. * * Riley! * Riley! * Riley! Oh, oh... (bang) * (police sirens) (Police radio chatter in background) Take her to the station and get a statement. I'm gonna talk to the husband. * Wait. I did it. Say that again. I told you. I did it. I killed her. * * Billy, can you help me with... I just want to see the house. ...boxes. * (slam) * * Wish I could be there with you both! Home soon. Love you, Riley. I thought he was supposed to be here? He was. He got the house all ready for us. See. Is this it? It's nice. Yeah, nice. We'll put some posters on your walls and get your super hero collection on the, on the desk and it'll be just like home. No it won't. Home is home. This can be home too. What about my friends? I don't know anybody here. It's going to totally suck. Billy! Don't say that. Well it is. Hmm, bet I can guess what this is? Gee, I wonder? So do I have to call him Dad? No, no. Not right away. But someday. He might like it if you did. What about Dad? My real dad? What about him? What am I supposed to call him now? You don't have to call him anything if you don't want to. Oh. * Everything is going to be okay. From now on. I promise. * (Paper crinkling) * * (Keys clicking) (Bird cawing) (snap snap) (snap) (Screams) Oh I'm sorry hun, I didn't mean to scare you. I just, uh, I just didn't see you there. You like trees, do you? Excuse me? You're taking pictures of trees. Oh, no, no. The birds. Oh right, right. Most of them are gone this time of year I thought. Well, I like the ones that stay behind. Hmm. Tough it out. Survivors. Yeah, I guess they are. (Train in background) Is there something I can do for you? Oh, God, no. Sorry. Look at me standing here dumb as a post. No, I'm sorry hun, I'm Torah. I'm Torah Weeks. I'm your neighbour from next door. Oh. Well, practically next door. I brought pie. * What on earth made you decide on Brattleboro? It was my husband's idea and then we got married last month and my husband found this place newly on the market so we took it right away. You're newlyweds, are you? So... How did you meet him? Well, uh, it's a little embarrassing. We, we met online. Really. No, no it wasn't like that. It's a website I belong to for people who like birds. Huh. Riley and I started chatting and one thing just sort of led to another and six months later here we are. The light in my room doesn't work. Billy, this is Torah. She's our neighbour down the street. Hey Billy. What about my light? Well, I will take a look at it later, all right? It'll be dark later. Then we'll get you another light. Nice to meet you, Billy. I'm sorry about that. This has been really hard on him.Oh. I'm sure you're doing the best that you can. Is his father helping our at all? He's really not part of our lives anymore. Oh, you had some troubles? You know, honestly, I'd rather not talk about it. It's over, you know. We've moved on. * Here's to moving on. To moving on. * (phone rings) VOICEMAIL:Hi, sorry I can't take your call. Leave me a message after the beep. (beep) Hey, it's me. I just wanted to hear your voice. The house is great. Thanks for getting it all ready for us. We're almost settled in. Anyway, I miss you and I can't wait till you to come home. Oh, I saw the flowers you got me. They're beautiful. I love... (Dial tone) (Sighs) ...you. * * (Crying) * I really appreciate you coming with me Torah. I've just got so much to do. Billy starts school next week I'm still trying to find my way around. Don't mention it. People are different up here. We take care of each other, you know. Around these parts trust is not a dirty word. I'd like to believe that. It's been hard the past couple of years for me to trust anybody. Well, maybe you had you're reasons. Hah yeah, one big one. Uh, huh. I married Mark right out of high school. Hmm. He didn't drink that much at first but uh, and there were the other women. (Sigh) Yeah, but if I confronted him about it he'd get angry. He'd hit whatever he could get his hands on, me usually. But the first time he slapped Billy that was the last time. We were out the door that night. * You know, I'm proud of you, girl. That took courage and now you've got yourself a new life and a good man and... And a new friend. That you do. Wait a minute. What is it? It's Riley. Who? My husband. * Riley. Cathy. Hi, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I thought you were still in Burlington. Yeah, I was. I, um, finished early. It's beautiful. Hello. Hello. Cathy, I uh... Oh, you must be Mrs. Coulter? This is awkward. Yes, isn't it? Well, I'm not sure what to say here. You might as well just go ahead with it. All right then but do you want it wrapped or do you want to just give it to your wife now? Oh, what? Well, this was supposed to be a surprise but here you go. I hope you like it. Riley, oh, Riley. There's an inscription on the back. Oh, it's beautiful. "To my one true love." You hate it? She hates it. I love you. I love you. Okay, smile. (laughing) (snap) Awe, here how about a family portrait. Billy, you get in there. Come here. Riley, this is, uh, this is Torah. I told you about her. She's our neighbour, and my new friend. Good to meet you Torah. Billy, how you doing? Okay, I guess. Okay, let me just figure this thing out. Oh, just, uh, hit the button on the right there. (beep beep) Oops. Oh, here, let me get it. Billy, stand with your mom there; my two best pals. On the count of three, ready? One, two, three. (snap) Beautiful. (Laughing) * * Give him time. * * (laughs) * Where are the others from today? (sigh) Torah! (Sigh) (Ice clinking) (Sigh) (gasps) Riley! Sorry honey. You uh...shouldn't sneak up on a guy. (Sigh) I just wanted to slip this in your wallet and surprise you. It's the only one that turned out. I guess Torah must have deleted all the others when she tried to work the camera. It's beautiful. I'll treasure this forever. Hey, I'm doing laundry. Where are the rest of your clothes? Oh, I left my bag in the trunk of the car. Forget the laundry. Is Billy sleeping? Riley, are you suggesting I avoid my wifely duties? It can wait. I don't have to leave again until tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow? I thought you we were going to stay home for a few days at least. Honey, I wish I could. I have this new client up in Burlington. I thought you just saw that new client up in Burlington? Oh this is another one. Burlington is a big town. Got to strike while the iron's hot. You know the drill. Yeah, I sure do. (Water splashing) Seeing as you gotta do laundry anyway... No, no, no. Don't! Riley, Riley, Riley! * (beep, click) (slam) Really. * * Aha. (grunts) Oh, Riley. * * Cathy, what are you doing out here? Where did you find that? I was looking for your other sock. I've been looking everywhere for that thing. What's the matter? It says "To my one true love" Yeah, of course it does. Riley, what is going on? What? Honey, you don't think that that's... baby, that's supposed to be yours. I bought it for you last month when I was up in Montpelier. Last month? Sure, I got it engraved. Put it in my bag to give to you when I went looking for it I couldn't find it anywhere. Tore my bag inside out, then finally gave up, decided I was gonna get another one. I know it's-- Not exactly the same but I think I like this one more. So you got this for me? Well, who else? * Well that's just about the silliest thing I have ever heard. You really thought that he had this made for some other woman. I know. I know it's ridiculous. I guess the thing with Mark has just left me so paranoid. I can't even think straight. Riley isn't Mark. Yeah. Tell you what. When Riley gets back why don't you two get away for the weekend? My family's got a place up at Lake Champlain. It's beautiful up there. I don't know. I-- I wouldn't want to leave Billy. Oh, don't worry about Billy. He can stay with me. I can use a man around the house for a while. I'll think about it. * * RILEY:Here we go. Here we go. BILLY:Okay yeah, a long toss this time. Here it is. Yeah. (laughing) Here it is. Yes. Here it is. Nice! Here it is Billy. Nice. I got it. Good catch. Thanks, Riley. (laughing) Throw it to me. Oh-- I'm coming for you. Ah! Here I come. (Billy and Riley laughing) * (clunk) * * RILEY:It's beautiful. I'll treasure this forever. * Okay, hold on everyone. Before we begin I would like to propose a toast. To my new promotion. What? Well it's not official or anything but this time next week you might just be dining with the new Regional Manager in charge of Distribution. Riley, that's wonderful. Put in for it last month. That's why I've been on the road so much lately. It'll mean a raise but more importantly no more traveling. I can spend more time here at home with my two best pals. Cool. That's, that's such good news. Congratulations honey. * Ah. (Phone buzzes) It's work. I got to take this. Yeah, hello. Ah, you're breaking up just hold on... (Door closes) * Eat your dinner honey. I've been working all weekend. Well, I'm sorry but it's out of my control. Do we have to talk about this right now because I'm in the middle of something and-- This isn't easy on me either, all right? Mom? I'll call you back. What's wrong? Hey. Hey, are you going to be long? I can put your dinner back in the oven. No, let's go eat. Let's go finish dinner, pal. * * (click) * (buzz) (buzz) * * (clicking) Agh. * * (beeping) Cathy? Are you down here? * * Couldn't sleep either? I thought I heard somebody down here. I'm sorry. It was probably me. Let's go back to bed. (click) TORAH:You know you really don't have to do this. Yeah. I do. I'll be back soon. * Bye baby. * * Bye. * * (slam) * (thunk) * (slam) * * (Cathy thinking) He told me he was working. What is he doing here? Who is he seeing in there? Is there someone else?...else * * (slam) * * (ding dong) (knocking) * Riley! I know you're in here. Riley! * Riley! * * Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh no! (gasping) (gasp) (Muffled screams) (Phone rings) (Phone rings) (gasping) (Phone rings) Uh. RILEY:Cathy. Riley. Listen carefully. Do exactly what I say. Riley, why? So shut up! You're gonna talk to the police. You're gonna make a full confession. You're gonna tell them that you murdered Lynn Rusk. I don't understand. Just tell them you were jealous. Tell them you found out I was cheating. Tell them whatever you want, but make them believe you. No! Riley, don't do this. And don't tell them who I am or you'll never see your son alive again. Riley! (smash) Ri-- Freeze. On the floor ma'am! (pleading) I didn't do this! On the ground ma'am! Now! On the floor! Don't make us ask again! (cries) All right. (Crying) You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do, can and will be used against you in a court of law. (Police radio chatter) Take her to the station. Get a statement. W-w-w--- wait. Wait. I said wait. Ma'am? I did it. Say that again? I told you. I did it. I killed her. Get her out of my sight. No, wait. * CAPTAIN:...At the murder scene. Forensic will take it from here. * Is that Mr. Rusk? Yeah. Poor guy probably doesn't know what hit him. * (door slams) (door slams) (engine starts) * Mr. Rusk? Yes. I'm Captain Breedlove, sir, Gloversville Police department. Very sorry for your loss but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you some questions. Of course, whatever I can do. * They were having an affair. According to Rusk, it was just a fling, a couple of times when he was on the road. I guess she took it a little more seriously. He said she wanted him to divorce his wife. He said no; she got angry; he broke it off. So she drives all the way here; shows up at their house. Mrs. Rusk's home alone; must of got scared. She phoned her husband. He phoned us. Do you think he suspected she was going to kill his wife? It doesn't much matter now does it? Forensics just sent this over; her prints on the gun. Hmm... And a signed confession. Game over. Take care of it. I'll never understand it. I mean how jealous do you have to get to kill somebody? * Here are her personals. Thanks. I'll try to get these back to you later ma'am. I get a phone call, don't I? Once I finish the paperwork. What happens then? Lockup. I take it you don't have your own lawyer. The guy who did my divorce. You trust him? No. They'll assign you a public defender on Monday and then the arraignment. That's where you enter your plea. Okay, all done. (Cathy sniffing) My phone call, please. Please. I just want to make sure Billy's okay. They didn't tell you. Vermont called us a while ago. Your son's doing fine. Your husband's taking good care of him. What? No. He'll be all right ma'am. I understand Mr. Coulter's getting him out of the house. Gonna take him away from all the attention. Well, w-w-where were they going? I don't know they didn't say. You should be thankful he's getting the boy out of there. These news guys can be crazy. * Ohh! Don't make a sound. Come on Mrs. Coulter. You're going to get me out of here. Keep quiet or I will use this. * (Police talking quietly) You're only going to make it worse. It can't get any worse. Unlock these. The key's at my desk. You're lying. Look-- Just give me the gun and we'll work this out. I promise. I didn't kill that woman. I believe you. No you don't. He made me confess. Who? My husband. He killed her and now he's got my son. Look, let me help you. You can trust me. No. I can't. She has a gun! Don't shoot! Suspect on the run. Let's go! Go around back. * (heavy breathing) * Ah! (grunting) * Mrs. Coulter! Mrs. Coulter! OFFICER:This way! Over here! See something? All right, all right. I want a car at that end and I want a car at that end. I want an APB out on her now! And you'd better tell them that she's armed. This is your fault Gresham. See anything? Aim your light along the river. Head that way. I'll take the other side. (Police radio giving APB) How about down there? By the bridge. Yeah, head that way. (police radio) Maybe up along those trees. Yeah take a look over there. * (Heavy breathing) * (Police chatter in background) No, I don't see anything here. What was that? Shine your light. Nothing. * * (ringing) Operator. I. I need to make a collect call. (Phone rings) Hello. Torah, where is he? Where's Billy? He's okay hun. Riley came home and picked him up. He's fine. Cathy, tell me that it isn't true. Tell me that you didn't kill that woman. No. No. It wasn't me it was Riley. Hold on hun, what are you saying? He set me up...Told me I had to take the blame for the murder or he'd do something to Billy. What are you talking about? Cathy. Cathy, where are you? Cathy! Check in here first. See if anybody's seen her. POLICE RADIO:Suspect was last seen heading South... (slam) (sighs) * Start the truck and drive away. You're the boss. * Check the north end of the parking lot. I'll grab these two cars over here. Let's just get out of here. Please. Oh, sorry. Name's Lou. What's yours? Cathy. Nice to meet you Cathy. I heard on the radio you were a killer. No, I... Yes, yes. I will do it again if you don't do what I say. * How many people you figure you've killed? Over all, I mean. A few. And do you always shoot them with the safety on? Now you want to tell me what kind of trouble you're really in? My husband, my husband killed a woman and now, now he's got my son and I don't know what he's going to do. He's got your son? Yes. Please, I have to find him. This husband of yours, why do you think he killed this woman exactly? I don't know. I don't know. I think he was married to her. And you too? At the same time? That's my granddaughter her mother married bad too. She spent her whole life looking for Prince Charming. Ended up with a toad. * Okay, we about to have some company. Hold on now. What you gonna do? Make a run for it? Maybe get yourself shot? How you going to get home to your boy then? Get back in there and stay quiet. And put this away before you hurt somebody. * (knocking) Evening officer. Evening sir. We're looking for a woman; late twenties; Caucasian. Yeah, why is that? Oh, she's wanted of murder over in Gloversville. Well, that's a terrible thing. Yeah it is. We think she's headed across the state line. You haven't seen anyone that matches that description, have you? Can't say that I have. Been on the road since noon haven't seen anything except my ugly face in the mirror. All right. Sorry for the trouble. Have a good night. You too. (Sigh) All right, you can come out now. We'll see what we can do about those charm bracelets at the next stop. * I knew she'd been seeing him before we were married. I didn't know she still had feelings for him. I just can't believe it. I think I've got all the information I need right now. Thank you, Mr. Coulter. If, uh, there's any you need please do let us know. Thank you Lieutenant. The truth is right now, my only concern is for the boy. He's been staying with a neighbour. I wanna get him out of here in the morning before the news people start circling. I understand but please let me know if you leave town. I may have a few more questions for you. Of course, whatever I can do. Thanks so much for watching him Torah. Of course. Mr. Coulter. What's going on? Where's my mom? Billy, you and I need to have a talk. * (clapping) That's enough. This is not a joke. We've got an armed murder suspect on the loose and I expect professional behaviour from all of you. Well, almost all of you. All right, Cathy Coulter was seen last night at a truck stop. We've got her on surveillance camera using a pay phone. We've blocked off all the major arteries in and out of the area. We've divided the region into quadrants. I want each team to start at the innermost corner of the quadrant and fan out from there. I didn't kill that woman. Gresham! Yes sir. I want you to back to that truck stop diner and see if anybody remembers anything. Understood? Yes sir. All right let's move out. I want that woman found. * Hey, don't let them bug you. They're just trying to give you a hard time. It's not that. I just.... I have this feeling we're after the wrong person. The wrong person? Yeah. You mean the one whose prints were found on the murder weapon? The one who confessed to the crime? That wrong person? Kind of convenient isn't it? I like convenient. Convenient gets me home in time for dinner. (Sigh) * * This is as close as we get if you want to surprise him. I don't know how I could ever thank you. Easy enough. Forget you ever saw me. I don't want some late night visit from the police asking me about aiding and abetting a known killer like yourself. Remember what I showed you. Safety off; get him in your sights; take a deep breath; exhale and then just... Don't pull, squeeze. (Laughing) Maybe if I'd taught my daughter how to use one of those she'd still be with us. Now, you go get your son. Okay. * * (heavy breathing) * * (click) * * (swoosh -- bang swoosh -- bang) (swoosh) (bang) * (swoosh) (bang) * (Crying) (Crying) (Screaming) * (swoosh -- bang swoosh -- bang) (swoosh -- bang swoosh -- bang) * Good morning. Thank you for calling Taylor Renfre. Yes, hello. Um... I need to know where you're located. I'm sorry? Your address. What's your address? Oh, I'm very sorry ma'am but I'm afraid I don't have that information. What? This is Taylor-Renfre right? Well actually what you've reached is an answering service. Okay, do you have another number for the company? I'm afraid not. This is a message only line. So how do you contact them to give them messages? We don't ma'am. They contact us. Do you have any other name or number for the company? I'm sorry I don't have that information but, if you'd like to leave your name and number. Yes, I'll leave a message for Riley Coulter and Warren Rusk and whoever else he is. Tell him I'm coming to get my son. (beeps off) (printer running) * * (Cell phone ringing) Hello. Is this Officer Gresham? Yes Mrs. Coulter. He's not Warren Rusk. Mrs. Coulter, stay where you are. I'll have a car sent to get you. Just give yourself up and let me help you. If you want to help me, go online and check out the Fitchburgh, Massachusetts Elementary School fire in 1987. Just slow down, I'm not understanding you. Riley Coulter, Warren Rusk, they were the kids who were killed in that fire. He's been taking their names and creating new identities for himself. That could just be a coincidence. I don't think so. You said you wanted to help me, then help me. If not just leave me alone and I'll find my son without you. (dial tone) Shoot. * * (Phone ringing) (door thunks) * (grunts) * * (radio music) Torah, are you here? (Heavy breathing) * * (Phone ringing) This is Officer Lee. Bobby, I need you to do something for me. Go online. Check out what you can on the school fire in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, 1987. School fire, Fitchburg. 1987. Do me a favour, don't mention this to Breedlove. What? Dan? (Dial tone) * * Where are you Mr. Rusk? * * (Birds cawing) (thunk) (distant train) (slam) * * (creaks) (knocking) * * Hello? Anybody home? Anybody home? * (dripping) * * Don't move. Do you have any idea of how tired I am of hearing that? What are you doing in my house? I'm looking for my husband. Why would your husband be in my house? Because you're married to him. I don't know. It's hard to tell from this. Travels all the time; never home more than one, two nights a week. Well he has to. It's his job. He's up for a promotion though. Yeah, yeah regional manager. He'll be able to stay at home more often with you and the kids. You were married before, weren't you? Yes, once. But it didn't work out? You felt lonely and vulnerable. Along came this knight in shining armour; handsome and charming; going to make everything okay for you and your kids. You don't have to feel like a sucker. We all fell for it. He's done it before under different names with different woman. He's killed them and made it look like an accident-- I'm not listening to anymore. (Hiss of pain) What happened to your leg? (sighs) I was just going down the basement steps and the railing broke. It was just a stupid accident. Do you know where he is? No, not exactly. I mean he's working, so it's hard... Can we just forget the excuses, lady, please? He has my son! All right, all right. I...oh... I'm going to need my pain pills though. They're in the kitchen on the fridge. * (whispering) Jeffrey, there's a woman in the house and she has a photo of you. She's in the house. And I just don't know. Who is she Jeffrey? She's in the house and she's saying terrible things about you.... Where's Billy you son of a bitch? Where's my son? (click -- dial tone) What's the number? it's his cell phone. Dial it! (Phone ringing) MACHINE:Hi sorry I can't take your call. Leave me a message after the beep. That's him. I recognize his voice from when he said, "I do." I'm going to borrow this in case he calls back. Look you don't have to believe me. To be honest I don't care either way but for you own sake, go upstairs, pack you bags, and get out of here before he comes home. (screen door clicks) Look I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. Yeah, so do I. Do you think there are others like us? I hope so. It's the only way I'm going to find my son. (slam) Yes sir, I agree and it's... It's not Cathy Coulter. Can I call you right back? Thanks. Close the door. (thud) We're after the wrong person. She didn't kill Lynn Rusk. Her husband did. Whose husband? Lynn's and Cathy's. What are you talking about? He's the same guy. Don't be ridiculous. The authorities over in Vermont already questioned Coulter's husband. We've talked to Rusk. I'm sure someone would have noticed if he had the same face. Have you seen a photograph of Riley Coulter? I called Brattleboro. They don't have one either. I've looked all over the Rusk house. Not a single picture of Warren Rusk but I found this. It's almost identical to the one Cathy Coulter was wearing and the inscription is exactly the same. "To my one true love" This doesn't mean he's a murderer. It means he's got no taste. But the names he using are-- Nah huh. That was the mayor on the phone. He already wants your head for letting her get away and my ass for not firing you. He's threatening to bring in the FBI. Now if that happens we are going to look like a bunch of idiots. You get out there and find Cathy Coulter. Move! * (Cell phone rings) Hello. They're dead. Who? His wives; all of them. I've gone through the list; all the names from the Fitchburg fire. He's married them; every one of them. How did you...? Wedding announcements. They're all online. I just typed in the last name searched nearby counties and states. I figured he wouldn't go far if he was trying to juggle all at the same time. There's no way he could have done this; murdered them all. Somebody would have figured it out. Not if they all died in some kind of accident. Just spoke to a man that told me his sister was married to Steve Campenella. She died last year; an accident. They haven't seen Steve since the funeral. He's a tall man they said, handsome; green eyes; dark hair. Let me guess. Steven Campenella died in 1987 in a school fire. That was the last name on my list. I don't know where to look now. I-- I don't know what to do. Mrs. Coulter, listen. Can you please stop calling me that? That isn't his name. No, it isn't. So where did he get it? I told you; those kids in the fire. Yeah, but why those kids. How did he know about them? Because that's where he lives. * (click, thunk) Thank you. Yeah, it was a terrible fire. I just moved here when it happened what, 20, 25 years ago. It started out in a bakery. Did you know that? No. Turned out the guy that owned the place was having a hard time paying his rent. So he decides to have a little accident. Make some insurance money, you know but it spread, quick; caught onto the school next door. It was one of those portable classrooms, you know. The whole thing went up. Door frame melted. Trapped them all inside. It was awful. The screaming. I can't imagine. Well, here we are. They don't get much upkeep anymore. Families all moved away from the area. Pretty painful memories. You say this fellow; that uh, he's been using their name? Wait, that... this one right here, Harpton; Rusk; Coulter. Well, I'm sorry, I can't say I recognize him. At least I haven't seen him anywhere around here that I remember. All right. Well, um... Thank you for your time. Sometimes you just can't figure people out, you know. I mean, why on earth would somebody be doing something like this. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Well, it's a lucky thing you spotted it. Most people have forgotten these kids by now except the parents I imagine. And probably John Morgan. Who? Well, John, John Morgan was the guy that owned the bakery next door to the school; the one who set the fire. I'll bet there's not a day goes by he doesn't think of these kids. * Hey John. Hi guys. * (thunk) (slam) Excuse me. Yeah? Mr. Morgan? You a reporter? No. Folks around here just know me as John. All right, John. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, all right. About what? I'm looking for a man who calls himself Riley Coulter. Who? He might also go by the name Warren Rusk or Jeff Harpton. What did you say you name was? I didn't. It's Cathy. Cathy Coulter. Yeah, well, let me tell you something Cathy Coulter I don't appreciate your sense of humour. I don't, I don't understand. I know those names but folks around here don't and I'd like to keep it that way. You, uh, you have a nice day. * I always mix in some black sunflower seeds around this time of year. Yeah, I do too, when I can afford it. Most people forget about feeding the winter birds but they're my favourites. Mine too. Survivors. Yeah, survivors. So, um, how did you find me? You're a convicted felon, Mr. Morgan. The state keeps its records on the internet. You must have wanted to see me real bad. Coulter or whatever he's calling himself, he's got my son. Now let's get something straight. I didn't mean to kill those kids. It was accident is all. That part of it, I mean. Oh, I meant to burn down the bakery. Damn place was bleeding me dry but the kids... I wasn't trying to-- Folks around here thought I was some kind of a monster or something. Wasn't my idea, not in the first place. It was that insurance man. Smart as a whip he was; knew all the ins and outs. Said we were going to split the money. Didn't tell me I was going to have to take the blame. Anyway, I did my time. The state put me up here. Help me get back into society. Please, please if you could help me. This, this man... He has my son. Let me see that. Where in the hell did you get this? It was taken last week at a store. Don't lie to me. This is Raymond Higgins. The insurance man I told you about. The one who set me up and there's no way this is a new picture because he died almost ten years ago. Died? Did he have a son? * (Cell phone rings) Mrs. Coulter. I told you to stop calling me that. That isn't his name. His name is Higgins, Carl Higgins. You know where he is? I know where he might be. I checked Carl's public records. Nothing's in his name but our mortgage is under a company called Hampton Heritage Corporation. The Rusk house is on there too, I'll bet if I look a little deeper I'd find half a dozen more. You think that's him? He's listed as the sole shareholder. The address is 1700 River Avenue, Cambridge. Is this enough for the police? No...but it's enough for me. I'm on my way. I can be there in two hours. Be there in one. Wait, don't do this alone. You know how dangerous he is. He doesn't know how dangerous I can be. (Tires screeching) * * (package crackling) * (slam) * * (Buzzer) * (Mutters) Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep your shirt on. (Mutters) * * (clinking) (ding) * * Billy? Billy? * * (shuffling) * * (bang) * * (snap) Ugh. Ah! (snap) * * Hello, Carl. (slam) * * (ding) (slam, click, click) Cathy? Where is he? (bang) Ugh! (grunts) Cathy! Where's Billy? Where is he you bastard? Give me that bag or you'll never see your son. How do I know he's alive? You aren't getting anything until I see him. (hand slams door) Agh! (police sirens) (slam) (slam) * Augh. (slam) (engine starts) (tires squeel) * (click) * * (Phone buzzes) Hi honey. Wrong honey. Cathy, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into here. Save it Carl. Let me make this easy for you. I want my son and you want what's in this case. All right, tell me where you are, I'll come to you. I've got a better idea. Why don't you do exactly what I say? You bring Billy to the City College student's union building rotunda which is nice and wide open. I don't have the boy. It'll take time to get him. Then you better hurry. If my son isn't standing beside me alive and unhurt by nine o'clock tomorrow morning this case of yours goes to the police. Is that clear, Carl? Cathy, listen to me. I've listened to you enough. Nine o'clock. (slam) (slam, clicks) * ID please? Gresham, Gloversville, New York. (detectives talking quietly) Are you the officer they sent over from New York? Yeah. (Cell phone rings) Be right with you. Hello. It's life insurance. What? This is why he's been doing it. He's been marrying them; killing them; making it look like an accident and then collecting the insurance money. I found a dozen different policies all under different names. He even had one all ready for me. I told him I wanted it in Billy's name not his. We got in this big argument but I wouldn't sign it. It's probably the only reason I'm still alive. All right, good. That's enough to arrest him on suspicion. I've got more than that. I've got everything you need to prove he killed the Rusk woman and the rest of them. If you want him, come get him. I'm meeting him here this morning. Okay, where are you? (Phone beeps) (sighs) (Dial tone) Damn. * * I've been having some trouble with my husband. (Phone rings) Officer Lee. Bobby I need you to map a cellphone location for me right now. Dan, you know I need a warrant for that. Screw the warrant. This is an emergency. I need the last location from this number. 603-555-1286. What if Breedlove finds out? Oh no. Oh no, what? He's not working alone. Who? Higgins. She's walking into a trap. * * Mom. Billy! * Billy, I'm so sorry. Give me my son. Not so fast. Give me my case. Give me my son. Not until you give me my case. What did you do with Torah? Why don't you ask her yourself? Hello friend. Oh, I'll take care of that for you. Let him go. You're really not in a position to be making demands are you Cathy? It's not a demand. You two can do whatever you want with me but you're not leaving here with Billy. Billy doesn't mind staying with us, do you son? I'm not your son. You can't get away with this Carl. People saw you come in. They saw me. If you think I wouldn't shoot you and anybody else in this place that tried to stop me from getting out of the mess you made, try me. Now why don't we go someplace quiet and discuss this. Let's go. * It would have been a lot easier if you had just signed the insurance policy to begin with. It's always worked before. I got the idea from my father. He told me it was cheaper for an insurance company to pay out a small claim then for them to spend the money to investigate it. So many lonely women out there all willing to sign away their lives if only somebody would love them. When we're you going to tell her, Carl. Tell me what? About his trip to Argentina. According to his ticket, he leaves tomorrow. Shut up. Got your passport and everything inside that case. Don't you Carl? What is she talking about? That digital thing in there, from the bank. That's for a bank account, right? Some sort of secret numbered account. Where? In the Cayman Islands, maybe. I said shut up. What account? Don't be so stupid. She's trying to cause trouble. Don't call me stupid. Don't you get it Torah? He's planning on leaving and throwing you to the police. If you don't believe me ask him to show you. One more word out of you and your kid's an orphan. Ask him to open the case. Open the case, Carl. Torah, don't be ridiculous. Don't you see she's what she's trying to do? Of course I do, but I still want you to open the case. Fine. (gasps) (clicks) (bang) Billy! Run! (grunting, struggling) Agh! (grunts) Help! My mom's in trouble. Where is she? You know what the problem is with woman like you? You don't even know that woman like me exist. What the hell? Freeze! (bang) Agh! (bang) (clatters) * (clang) * (Police radio chatter) Billy! Billy! Mom! Oh! Oh! Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Oh! I've got to go downtown with these guys they've got a couple questions. Sure they do. Oh, um, I've got your personals. Thank you. I'll be back in a second. (Sighs) * Thank you. It's all in here; the policies; the names; fake IDs; everything. I should have trusted you. I should have believed you. * At least we know where to start. Yeah. And by the way, it's Cathy. *
