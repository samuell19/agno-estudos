Are you ready? Are you excited? So put your hands together and welcome on stage Mr. Varun Thakur! Good evening ladies and gentlemen. How are you guys doing? Good evening, my name is Varun Thakur. As you may have figured by now, I am a stand-up comedian. But sometimes I feel like a prostitute. I'll tell you why. The other day I get a phone call, I answer the phone. The person at the other day, he's like... "Hi Varun, what's your rate?" I'm like, "Sir, I think you are looking for a different kind of stand-up." He still doesn't get it. He's like... "Hey Varun, what's your rate? How much you do and how long you do for?" By that point I've given up. I'm like... "You want to know with or without the happy ending?" But I don't blame him, right? Because being a comedian is not really as popular a profession just yet. Even people my age get confused. My friend Pooja, made me meet her friend Tina my friend Pooja. Made me meet her friend Tina, she's like... "Tina, this is Varun, he is a comedian." So even Tina looks. And I was like, "Hi?" And then they both walk away. And I can hear Tina tell Pooja... "He wasn't that funny." I'm like I said hi. What you want me to do? Dance around? Like even my parents, the first time they came up to me and they said... "What do you want to do in life?" So I said I want to be a comedian. So even they looked at me. "All that is okay, but what do you want to do in life?" But nowadays they are a lot more supportive, my dad comes home and says... "Hey! I have a joke for you." I'm like, "Yes dad, tell me." So he takes out his phone and... "Where is WhatsApp? Here do this." And I'm like, "Dad, that's a WhatsApp joke. I can't do that on stage." And he's like, "You do it in your own way, no." Because Indian parents don't give a fuck about Intellectual Property. "Ah! You do it, do it." Then I realised that's what Anu Malik's parents told him. Dad, dad! Arabic song. "The building is tall." You know, not just our parents. Even people who organise comedy shows aren't really in tune with how comedy works. So I was doing this show in Delhi. I reached the place, the event guy calls me up. He's like, "Sir, you had a good flight?" I said, "Yes." "You're tucked in nicely in the hotel?" I said, "Yes." "Sir, just want to ask you one thing. Will you need a mic?" That's literally the only thing I need. I'm like, "No, actually I don't need a mic. You know what? I don't even need an audience. You just put a chair there, I'll come and start blabbering." I was in Goa day before yesterday. And I am performing at an auditorium, I am in the green room, I go to the loo and I find out that the hand wash isn't there and there's no paper napkins. So I go to the guy who runs the auditorium... "Sir, there's no hand wash and paper napkins in the toilet." So he looks at me and very seriously says... "Yeah, so? It's Sunday today." I'm like, "Don't people take a dump on Sundays? What do you mean it's a Sunday?" For the longest time, every time my parent's friends ask them you know... "What does Varun do?" They couldn't really say. So my dad would say, "Something creative." I don't know why this is the symbol of creativity. I'm like, "Dad! This doesn't mean I'm creative. This means I am ACP Pradyuman from CID." But I am half Sindhi, half Maharashtrian. Which means I am full of billion business ideas but too lazy to execute. Why are you clapping because Maharashtrians are lazy? Here's the thing. I come from a middle class background. Any middle class people in the house? Make some noise. Of course, always happy, always excited. Yeah! You know how you know someone is middle class? They'll tell you. Over and over again. No, no. We don't do this. We are middle class. No, we are middle class. We don't do this. Middle class people love two things. They love displaying their modesty and their underwear. Standard. Before you go to a middle class person's house, you already know what colour underwear they wear. We have this weird affinity towards plastic. We love plastic. We want to cover everything up in plastic. Especially our remotes. I got my new TV five years ago. My remote still has plastic. And it's not like we put new plastic every year, it's the same plastic. The gum from the cello tape has dried and it's hanging like that. But we still use it. I asked my dad. I'm like... "Dad listen. Why do we still have this plastic cover on the remote?" This is what he told me. "Son, the reason it is like this is because when people come to our house, they need to see we keep our stuff properly." I'm like, "Who are these people? Who are coming to your house and judging you by how you keep your remote." "We had gone to the Thakur's. The house is okay but the remote..." You know there is optimum utilisation of resources in middle class households. Optimum utilisation of resources. The other day I was brushing and then the toothpaste is over. So I told my dad, "Dad, the toothpaste is over." He's like, "What? Give it to me. You can't even use it properly." I'm like, "Use it properly? I've used it." "Give it." Then he did something called 'The Middle Class Squeeze.' You guys know The Middle Class Squeeze? Where you take the paste and then you turn it. And then you press it. And throw it on the ground and... If it still doesn't work, "Hey, get the tractor quickly." Even when we use our shampoos right, you guys when you come to the end of the shampoo, what do you guys do? "Fuck this." We don't do that. We're like, "Give me water." Even when we buy a car, we buy everything that comes with the car. You know, the detachable stereo system. The tissue paper with Britney Spears' face on it for some reason. That Ganpati up-top and the Ambi Pur bottle. That's the most important thing. The Ambi Pur bottle. Till it gets over. And you realise the new bottle cost 500 bucks. So this empty bottle just sits there in front of the AC. Even when we shop for clothes, we'll always shop in a sale. Always. You go shop in the sale, the older brother wears it. When he is done, he gives it to the younger brother. Once he is done wearing it, it becomes one of three things. It becomes a rag, a night suit or your watchman will wear it. Go to my building right now, you'll see a 35 year old Bihari guy wearing a T-shirt that says, 'Fuck me. I am famous.' Don't ask me why I had that T-shirt. And if it doesn't become one of these things, it becomes clothes for Holi. "Son, don't throw this. Wear this during Holi." I have a cupboard full of Holi clothes. I have 35 options of clothes to wear on a day where nobody gives a fuck about what I'm wearing. You know, but we are not happy with what we get. Once you pay some amount of money, you will always want more. Middle class people always want more. You get the sandwich, "Add some chutney. Add some more. A little more." This is their go to response. "Please add some more." Because the other person is like... "Fuck man. Take this." You know middle class people treat their kids like they treat their electronics. If it's not working, hit it hard. I've never given my electronics for repair. My dad just takes it and hits it really hard and it starts working amazingly. They do the same thing with their kids. Like when I was younger, my mom would run around the house hit me with anything that was one arm distance away. Anything. Belt, rolling pin. One day she threw a potato cutlet at me. And I was like, wait. Should I irritate her more so that she throws chutney and bread also? But dads don't do that. Dads don't do that. Dad will just sit in the chair, look at you and say... "Hey, come here. You come here. I am not running after you. I will hit you here." My parents were really supportive. You know they've supported everything I do. Even when I was younger they would push me to do a lot of things. Especially fancy dress. Did people here take part in fancy dress, make some noise! It's fucking amazing. I love fancy dress and my mom was really serious about fancy dress. You all have to do fancy dress... She was like very competitive, you know. In our school, we had a rule. If one place plays a character, another person can't do that. Right? So in my first fancy dress competition, I wanted to dress up as Gandhi. And then I remembered, why do they call it fancy dress? I'm dressed up as Gandhi, which is the least fancy... a dress can get. Right? But there was another kid. Even he wanted to be Gandhi. So we were both fighting. "I will become Gandhi, I will become Gandhi. I will become Gandhi." Then our mothers were very competitive, got involved. "No, my son will become Gandhi. My son will become Gandhi. My son will become Gandhi." Eventually I got to play the part. But I was really scared, I was hoping the other mother doesn't dress her son up like Nathuram Godse. "Aunty please don't do that. It'll be very wrong, very wrong. Don't do that, please." So I got to be Gandhi, right? And I had my full dress on. I had the dhoti, I had the glasses, I had the bald cap. But as I was going up, the bald cap slipped. So all the hair in the front just stood up like that. So now I have a spike cut. And I go up on stage, so basically I was Gandhi if he was in Dil Chahta Hai. The second year my mom said... "You know what we'll mix it up a little bit. This time, I am going to dress you up as a drug addict." Hold on, let me explain. She was like, "You know what I am going to do? I am going to give you a straw. The straw will have powder in it, you go up on stage you blow the powder out, powder goes up. You cough *coughs*! Drugs are bad, don't do drugs." I'm like sure. I am 9 years old, I don't give a shit. So the day happens and I am waiting in the aisle, about to go up, the teacher's on stage announcing the other guy out she's like, "Rohan, that was a very good peacock. Up next, we have Varun and he is a... Good peacock, no? Up next is Varun and he is a... drug addict." And I just walked in on stage sauntering like that because that's how I think drug addicts are. I've gone in and I've just blown up! *coughs* Drugs are bad, don't do drugs. I came first. You know, now I realise my mom made Udta Punjab 20 years ago. And in the final year of fancy dress, my mom said... "You know what? This year you're going to be something out of this world." I'm like, "Really? What?" She's like, "You're going to be Miss World." I'm like, "Sure. I am 10. I don't give a shit." And so I was wearing my cousin sister's halter dress, off shoulder? Whatever the fuck that is called. You know the gloves in my hand and the tiara and the sash. And here's how middle class my parents are. Even in a hypothetical competition where they could dress me up as anything. They dressed me up as Miss World. Not Miss Universe. So I asked my mom. "Mom! Why can't I be Miss Universe?" She looked and me and she was like... "Son, have you seen your face!" You guys agree that we have the worst ads on Indian TV, yes? Make some noise if you think they are the worst ads. I think they are getting worse by the day, right? The other day was watching TV and I saw an ad for bottled water. Manikchand Oxyrich. Because when I think of clean, pure drinking water, I think of Manikchand. It's called Manikchand Oxyrich. And the tagline is, "Now with more oxygen." Here is a scientific joke for you, guys. Chemical composition of water is H2O. Two atoms of hydrogen, one atom of oxygen. More oxygen makes it H2O2. Which is hydrogen peroxide which will kill you. But it's Manikchand. So it probably is hydrogen peroxide. Then there was an ad for a phone company, okay? I forget which one it is. And the USP of that phone is that it's two-way answer phone. Because you know sometimes when you answer the phone you answer it the other way round. But now don't worry, because Samsung has a new phone for you guys. Seriously. How lazy are these fuckers? That you had to dedicate an entire Research & Development team on doing this. See, who are these people? You call them and they'll be like... "Hello!" "Yeah, say!" "Bro, I can't hear you." "Because I am holding the phone the other way round." I'm like, "So hold it properly." "No, it's too much work. I think I need a new phone." Every ad on TV is technology, right? No matter what the product is. "This has technology." Like two letters and technology after that. "This has technology. Wow, we will have to buy it." And I was in Pune and I heard this ad on radio, right? The ad was... "A-1 mosquito repellent, now with Mosquito-Go-Away technology." Guys, they've stopped giving a fuck. They're like, "Write anything. Write technology, these morons will buy it." Mosquito-Go-Away technology? Could lesser fucks be given in naming technology? It's like he made this technology and then went to his two year old niece... "Sweetie, what should I name this?" "Uncle, what happens with this?" "Mosquitoes go away." "Mosquito-Go-Away technology." Then you have ads for face wash. Like a face wash is not a face wash anymore. Face wash is anti-darkening, anti-pimple, anti-wrinkle, anti-twinkle, anti-this, anti-sweat. A new Garnier face wash is anti-pollution. I was like, what? We are killing it in science and technology. We are removing pollution with our face wash. I'm like why are poor people in Delhi following the Odd and Even rule. They should just be putting face wash in their exhaust pipe. Even ads for creams. When you watch any ad for creams, what does it say? "This contains vitamin A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J..." There's more vitamins in my cream than my breakfast. And that ad would always end with... "Vitamin blah blah. And essential minerals." I'm like if the minerals are so essential, tell me what they are. Why are you hiding it? Did you watch any ad for deodorants? What does it say? Spray this deodorant, chicks will have sex with you. But there is this new deodorant. New Fogg deodorant. They changed their USP. They're like, "Now, with guaranteed 800 sprays." All the Gujjus are like, "Wow! What a deal! 800 sprays in 80 rupees? Amazing!" No seriously. Now with guaranteed 800 sprays? So every time I spray a deodorant, I have to maintain a fucking excel sheet. "Kshh kssh! Monday, 2 sprays." "Kshh kssh! Wednesday 5 sprays." "Kssh! Saturday I'm meeting a girl so I'll use the whole bottle." But there was an ad a couple of years back. I don't know how many of you guys saw. There was an ad-- (distinct laughter) Wow! Someone's getting the joke now. There was an ad, there was an ad a couple of years ago for rat poison. I don't know if you guys saw that. And the tagline for that was... "Rats will eat this inside your house, then die outside." You guys remember that, right? Tell me one thing. Are rats that obedient? And this one rat comes home, he's eating it. Suddenly he starts gagging. Another rat is like, "Hey Prakash! What are you doing? Go outside and die. Haven't you seen the ad? Get out. Get out. Get out." But these are ads on TV. I'll tell you the worst kind of ads. Please tell me you guys watch Teleshopping. (audience cheers) It's my midnight entertainment. Just watch Teleshopping. The minute you are sad, tired, depressed in life, just watch that. And bless yourself that you don't have to do that. Because I have been called to audition for Telebrands. I am not even kidding you. I've been called to audition for Telebrands. I was watching it the other day, I was watching Telebrands. Any ad for Telebrands begins like this. You have a white dude that just says one thing, "I used to be very fat." It makes no difference what the product is. This is a roti maker. "I used to be very fat." "I used to be very fat." So the ad that I was watching the other day, they were selling low calorie toothpaste. Who the fuck is eating toothpaste? And why? Can you imagine the ad for that? "I used to be very fat. I used to eat all my toothpaste. While brushing in the morning, I'd have lunch, breakfast, dinner all at once. I used to be an idiot. But now I use this toothpaste from Telebrands and I'm an even bigger idiot now." (distinct laughter) Wow! We have a hyena in the crowd. So that's one kind of Teleshopping ads. But there is another kind. It's called Gold Safe. Has anyone here watched Gold Safe? I'll tell you for those of you who don't know Gold Safe is this show where they show you pictures of two celebrities put together. I was 100 percent sure. 50 percent of you guys have called it also. Fuck you guys. I'm sure. So the Gold Safe is a show where a picture of two celebrities are put together. You know using state-of-the-art technology like... Microsoft Paint. I was watching it the other night, they had a picture of Sachin Tendulkar and Kareena Kapoor put together. Sachin's face is round. Kareena's face is long. Their resultant picture looked like an ice-cream cone. Because they don't give a fuck. They're like, "Add anything. Nobody will know." And then you have this amazing host who comes up and she says... "Hello! You are watching Gold Safe. If you call now and guess who are these celebs, you will get a chance to win 50 thousand rupees. Just imagine, what all can you buy with 50 thousand rupees. You can buy a car, an AC, TV, fridge, you can go out for dinners, you can party too. In 50 thousand rupees. Come on! Call now and guess who are these celebs." Compared to her, Shankar Mahadevan's Breathless sounds like a fucking lullaby. I don't know who this chick's cocaine dealer is but I want her number. And she is really bad. She's really bad. Her entire career is a bad audition tape. "Come on, call now and guess who are these people." Then the best thing happens. Because all the callers call in. Right? And these fuckers never get it right. Okay, so one caller comes in... "Our first caller. Come on guess. Who are they?" "Madam, Sunny Deol and Lara Dutta." I'm like a blind goat can get that answer right. Then other guy calls up... "Our second caller. Guess who these celebs are?" "Madam, Arjun Rampal and Kangana Ranaut." I'm like you called Sachin Tendulkar, Arjun Rampal? Sachin's great with a piece of willow. Arjun Rampal is the piece of willow. So maybe. But still. And then she realises no one is getting it right. Because like 80 people called and nobody gets it right. So then she's like... I can see what you're doing." And suddenly you're like, "Oh shit!" She's like, "I can see what you're doing. I am here just for you. Just for you. I am here so that you can win 50 thousand rupees. 50 thousand. I'll give you hints if you want to win. Hints. Check this guy out. Anjali Tendulkar." I'm like really? That's your hint for Sachin Tendulkar? Anjali Tendulkar? And then she's like, "Check this girl out. She is not a Ash. She is not a Sonam. She is not a Bipasha. She is not a Katrina. Her name starts with K- and ends with -areena Kapoor. Guess who is she." Even then some dickhead calls up and he's like... "Oh madam, Sanjay Kapoor!" Then nowadays they've started selling viagra... on Teleshopping. Have you guys seen that? Power Prash! Power Prash! And they make it seem so legitimate. You know they have one dude who is wearing a dhoti and a kurta. He signifies the Ayurvedic side of things. Then next to him is a guy in a suit who signifies the scientific side of things. And then you have Kashmira Shah, who signifies tits. And she looks to the camera and she's like... "Nowadays a lot of couples go through a lot of physical problems. And now let's hear Manoj and Payal's story who are facing the same physical problem." And then you cut to a recreation of Manoj and Payal's life. Where Manoj is just standing like that and Payal is just... And Manoj is like... "Payal, what happens to you every morning?" And Payal looks at him and goes... "Me? What happens to you every night?" Ohh! That's cold. And Manoj has no comeback right there. He's like... And then Payal just goes on and on. She's like, after marriage have you even pleasured me? Those beautiful memories, those colourful nights. Those sweet talks. Those wet dreams." Here's the thing. In this entire ad, for viagra they don't mention the word sex even once. They only speak in these weird euphemisms. And he's like... "Payal, but I am trying!" "Trying? You just keep trying then. Here are the divorce papers." I was like one second. Why are you roaming around with divorce papers? Even divorce lawyers don't have it handy. How the fuck do you have it handy? And she pulled it out of her Salwar Kameez. I'm like how the fuck does the Salwar Kameez have a back pocket? It's baffling. And she get's pissed and she throws and runs away. And walks out. And Manoj is like, "Payal!" You know because this signifies loss. And he turns around. As he turns around, his friend is behind him. Who is in a full suit and a tie, ready to go to work. And he turns around and he's like... "Hey! Ravi!" And Ravi is standing there, okay? Two things wrong with that. First thing... for Ravi to be behind him, he'll have to have been inside the house. And he's like, "What happened Manoj?" Manoj says, "I don't know what to say, Ravi." "If you won't tell me, then who else will you tell this to?" He's like, "Forget it." And walks away. Walks away, goes to a window. And just stands in the window. Because this signifies sadness. And then Ravi comes from behind. And as the reassuring hand of the friend on the shoulder. You know like... Like that. He's like, "Hey Manoj. I am your friend. Tell me what happened." And he turns around and again now, he doesn't say the word sex. He just says, "I don't know how to say this, man. After marriage I haven't been able to pleasure Payal. Those colourful memories, those sweet talks, Those colourful memories." And this is Ravi's response. "That's it? Such a small problem!" Here's the thing, Ravi. If your friend has an erectile dysfunction, saying such a small problem... is not the right thing to say. And Manoj is like, "That's not a small problem!" He's like, "This is nothing. Here, use Power Prash." Why the fuck is this guy ready to go to work with a packet of Power Prash in his... It's like this dude wakes up every morning, he's like, "Lot of my friends can't get it up." So I should be a good guy. And just drop off a pill At everyone with erectile dysfunction. Seriously. This entire ad, is about two people who have something in their back pocket. And one person who has nothing in his front pocket. But I didn't always wanted to be a comedian. I actually wanted to study filmmaking, you know. I went abroad to study filmmaking. I was in London for a year. Where I spent the first six months trying to get them to pronounce my name right. Because they are like, "Vroon! Vroon!" I'm like dude, just call me Tom, it's okay. And I spent the next six months trying to explain to them what are plastic cups doing in my toilet. That's always an awkward conversation right? All my white friends would come home and say... "Vroon! Why is there a plastic cup in your bathroom?" "The thing is when I pee, I get really thirsty so I'd like to have a glass handy." Do you guys like the British accent? You guys like the British accent? Sounds very sexy, sounds very cool. My first proper exposure to British accent, I walk into school and this guy is looking at me. He looks at me... "Mate can you pass me the bo-uhl of wa-uh." He's like, "Can you pass me the bo-uhl of wa-uh.?" I'm like, *gibberish* One word, English. Sounds like? And this guy is pissed off. This guy is pissed off. He's like, "Can you pass me the bo-uhl of wa-uh?" I'm like bottle of water? I don't get it. The British people made the language. Use all the words. "No, no. We've invented the language. We'll omit a few words. Go fuck yourself! Now interpret it yourself. We're not going to spane food. Spane food? Spoon feed. Fuck. You know the student hostel I stayed at right? We decided to have a potluck and get to know each other. Now we were all supposed to cook food from our own country. I was a really poor student. I only had a packet of Poha with me. Do you all know what Poha is, yes? So I made Poha and took it for dinner. I'm like what the fuck will these caucasians know. I don't know what the Chinese guy made but I am pretty sure it wasn't dead. Because I took a serving and it started running away from me. I'm like, "Hey! Shut the gate. My dinner is trying to escape." The French girl made the *gibberish* Because that's what the French people do, right? Make you eat shit you can't pronounce. *gibberish* I'm like, "Hey! Same to you." The Afghan kid kept looking up hoping for a NATO helicopter to drop something. He's like, "Hey! Food please! Food." But I wasn't any better. I only had a plate of Poha with me. And this white girl walks up to me. She's like, "Vroon! What have you made?" "These are flattened rice flakes with robust Indian spices with assorted onion and dash of lime and sprinkle of coriander and basil leaves." Fuck yeah! I went Master Chef Andheri on it. I'm like, "Here, have some Poha." But saying that stuff helps right? A dash of lime. Sprinkle of coriander. Basil leaves. Basil leaves are like the push up bras for food. They don't do shit but they make your food look great. So you know when I was in the UK, they launched the Bandra-Worli Sea-link so I was fucking excited. I went to all my friends, I'm like... "Guys, check out. There's a sea-link in my city. There's a sea-link in my city." But no one's excited. Because my flatmates were German, American and Chinese. "Hey fuck off. Get lost!" "We have 30 thousand fuck off." I was excited and I had to share it with someone. So I was like, "Hey Bangladeshi. No, no! I won't hit you. You come here. Come here! Slippers, leave your slippers outside." The Pakistani guy got really excited. He's like, "Hey! Sea-link? Very good, man! How many entry points does it have? 5? Okay, okay! We can go there by boat? By boat? Okay! Okay! Do they have police protection? Okay...okay!" But that's the thing with Pakistanis right? Half the time they just pretend to be Indians and the rest of the time they'll be like... "Pakistan...Pakistan!" Especially during sports. "Pakistan will win today. Pakistan will win." And I'm like dude, relax. I know you know the results of all the games. But chill. But he's like, "Today Pakistan will win. Today Pakistan will definitely win." I'm like, "How? England is playing Australia. How will Pakistan win?" The first time I went to London, right? I was in the cab, I was waiting at a signal and I see this old Englishman walk. And he is wearing a jeans, T-shirt, keds. Suddenly he walks to my car, knocks on the window and starts begging. I'm like, "There's beggars in London as well?" "Can you put some change?" I'm like, "Hey, buddy listen. I come from India. Okay? I'm so desensitised to beggars, you have no idea. The last guy who begged from me didn't have an arm. You have to up your game. Seriously. You are dressed better than I am. You speak better English. Do something at least. Tear your clothes. Sing a little. Something?" "Hey give me some change." "Hey give me some change." You know white people get really excited when they find out that you're from India. "Oh my God! You're from India? I love India. I really want to go to India." I'm like, "Why?" And they'll all say this one thing. "To find myself. I want to find myself. Yoga and... ...ashram" I'm like, "You go to Marol. You'll never find yourself." And it was this girl's birthday, right? It was this girl's birthday. She's Greek, she called us all over. She was like, "Guys, you know what would be awesome? Is if you all sang Happy Birthday to me in your own language." Great, because the American guy is like... "Happy Birthday to you." And the Chinese guy is like... "Fu fu!" Whatever. I'm not being racist. Every country has the same tune for happy birthday. Now they're all looking at me. And I'm just standing there like a constipated Udit Narayan going... "May this day come again and again. My heart sings again and again. May you live a thousand years, I pray. Happy Birthday to you." Why couldn't we have the same tune for Happy Birthday? Where is Pritam when you need him? Alright guys, that's been my time. You've been absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much. Welcome on the stage, struggling actor... Vicky Malhotra! Yes hi friends Vicky this side. And yosulf? Very very fantastic. Good to be here. Hi baby! Is that your brother? Bro, don't leave her alone like this. Yes hi guys. I know most of you all know mahsulf. But if you all don't then probably you are living under a rock or Koparkhairne or whatever. Because both places don't have Snapchat. But for all you loserz who don't know mahsulf. I have to tell you stuff about me. If there are any directors in the crowd or whatever or they want to make a biopic on me or whatever. So you'll know everything. Okay! So here's the thing about me. I'm a guy. And mah profiles are... Thank you. My chest is 38 inches, biceps 22 inches, penis 11 inches. And when I am not horny it's 10 inches. Mah hobbies are living, chilling, killing, raging, dancing, internet and pilates. Mah best friend is Sunny. He's an actor. Tommy, he's an actor. Juggy, he's an actor. Lovey, he's an actor. Monty, he's an actor. And Sanket... he's a physicist. But we don't talk to him much because he's a very pretty lame guy. Since school he's been so lame like he likes reading. Who the fuck likes reading? Who the fuck likes reading? And that idiot would sit and learn trigonometry. I'm like bro, you're never going to use trigonometry in real life. Never. Like where will you go? You go to buy vegetables. "Sir, give me some tomatoes. What is the tan theta for this? Tan theta?" You don't do that. You don't do that. But I am also a reader. I am also a reader. There is this amazing book that I read you know. It helps me calm, chillax, relax. It's for good for me time. You must've heard of it. It's called Playboy. Once I pick the book up, I just can't keep it down. Get it? Bro, you know what the joke is right? Because I have an erection, I can't keep it down. That's the joke. Mah favourite sun sign is Scorpion. And... (audience cheers) And I am an Aries. Mah favourite song is Summer of '639. It's fucking amazing. Like Summer of '639. I don't know what 639 is. I think it's a band name, school roll number whatever. But it's fantastic. I love it. I love it. Very pretty fantastic that is. Mah favourite non-veg food is butter chicken. And mah favourite veg food is also butter chicken. Because veg food sucks. And I think vegans should just stab themselves with a carrot. Like seriously. What the fuck are these vegans? They're so annoying. Like I'll tell you why I get irritated okay. Like the other day, I went on a date with this slutty chick. And... We went for the date and so I called for mah food. You know I called for butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, butter naan, chicken naan, garlic naan and edamame sushi. And I told her, "Yosulf can call for whatever you want." And she's like, "Vicky! I'm very pretty sorry. But I'm a vegan." I'm like, "Oh my God. Oh my God. Yosulf is a vegan? What are you going to tell me next? You have herpes?" But anyway she had nice tits so I stayed. And then she called for her food. She called for organic, non gluten, non dairy, non tasty, legume only salad. Basically she called for air in a bowl. Then we called for the bill and mah bill was 600 and her bill is 1200. 1200? I'm like how does your food have half the ingredients and is twice the price? But she has nice tits, so I paid. No, but I told the slutty vegan chick, I told her, "Listen. Your dinner might be vegan but your dessert is at my house and it's non-vegan." Yea, I've never spoken to her after that but fuck it. You know but like see, I'm a sexist guy. I'm a sexist guy. I am telling you straight up, I'm a sexist guy. Alright? My friends are like... "Dude, you can't tell that in public." I'm like, "Fuck you. I can tell whatever I want." And what's wrong with sexist? Like person who likes lyrics is a lyricist. Person who like cycle is a cyclist. I like sex. So I'm a sexist. Or fuckist or doggy stylist. Whatever you want to call me. Whatever. You know, mah favourite holiday destination is Ibiza. I love Ibiza because for a rager like mahself Ibiza is like Vaishnodevi. I'm like, oh Ibiza Ibiza! It's very pretty fantastic. It's always parties and all everywhere. Like you go for a pre-party, then you go for a party. Then you go for the after party, then you go for a post party. Then you go for the after post party. And then you go for the morning rave party. And then you come back from the post party which is the pre-party of the after party. And then party party, another party and then another party. And after 19 days, it'll be party party party! It's very pretty relaxing. It's very pretty relaxing. You know all hot people come and ask me like... "Bro, why do want to be a comedian?" To these people I say, "Fuck you." I can be whatever I want. You know what I mean? See, here's the thing. I'm trying an alternative way to get to Bollywood. You know, I am a very alternate kind of guy. Alternate. Oh alternate. Oh alternative. Oh alternate guy. Have you seen me walking? Oh fuck he's so alternate. Fuck! Like that! It's so very pretty simple like see Vir Das became comedian became actor. Himesh Reshammiya became singer became actor. Tusshar Kapoor became Jeetendra's son became actor. So basically it's mah dad's fault. Okay, all my dad had to do was become an actor and I would become an actor. But no, my dad became a businessman. He could be anything. He could be a producer, director, music director, spot boy, whatever. I would become an actor. But no. He want to be a businessman. Yea, mah dad is a businessman. Mah mother is a mom. And... Like... No really, she's a mom. She's a mom. What do you know? She's a mom. My mother is a mom. And then you know people keep asking me like, "What kind of businessman is your dad?" I'm like, I don't give a flying fuck. As long as I get 10 lakh rupees a month for ma living, chillin, raging, I don't care. I don't care if he's a businessman or a bar dancer, cocaine dealer. Whatever. Infact, I don't even know my dad's first name. His name on my phone is 1204 Malhotra. 1204 is his ATM pin. Let me have mah protein shake. Protein is very pretty important. So anyway I told my dad, "Dad listen why doesn't yosulf be like other guy's dad. Why can't you produce a movie for mahsulf? Just give me 50 crore and produce a movie for mahsulf. Like Hrithik's dad did it. In 2000. 2003, 2007, 2009, 2016. Why isn't yosulf doing it?" He's like, "Okay fine son. Here is 50 crores." I'm like, Kewl? I got it. But the problem is that none of these actresses want to act with mahsulf. And they're all giving me lame reasons like... "Oh, we are not okay with topless scenes. We are not okay with bottom less scene. We're not okay with frontal nudity, backal nudity, lip lock, item number." I'm like yea, good luck in Bollywood. Seriously like mah surname is Malhotra... not Barjatya. So if any of yosulfs is a sexy actress and wants to act in mah movie Sex, Love or Something Else, let me know. Very pretty hit movie. When it comes out. Sex, Love or Something Else. It is always something else. You know the other day I called my dad and told him... "Dad listen, for my surprise b'day gift, I want a BMW. I just told him straight away, for my surprise b'day gift, you have to give me a BMW." You know what my dad did? He gave me an Audi. Fuck. I'm like, "Dad, if you don't love me, just tell me. What are you giving me this Audi for? Shee!" Like he's done this in the past also. Like when I was young, I told mah dad. I said, "Dad listen! I want a dog. I want a Doberman." You know what my dad did? He got me a pomerrrrrian. What the fuck? Pomerrrrrian? I don't want a pomerrrrrian. Very pretty annoying. Anyways he was a cute dog. You know and I didn't want to give him any cliched names like Tommy or Tuffy or whatever. So I called him Scooby. And you know they say that the dog behaves like it's owner. So obviously mah dog was very pretty horny. Because one day he was fucking air. Like he was fucking air. He was just fucking air like that. You know we were all sitting at home eating dinner or whatever and the doors open, this fucker ran away. He ran away. My dad and I running after him, we go to the neighbouring lane. Now he's become friends with these group of dogs. All chilling or whatever. And then another gang of dogs come and they are about to fight like Eagle gang, Scorpion gang. I'm like, "Scooby, come here. Don't do Saila-ru Saila-re. Come here." Confusing. He's like, "Saila-ru, saila-re!" I'm like what? What are you doing? Seriously. So we went to get him and he ran away from us. He ran away and mahsulf and my dad are running after him and then I could hear a car screech. And then I heard a sound... "Awwoo Awwoo Awoo!" I'm like oh mah God! Scooby's come under a car. So when I went and checked. I'm like oh thank God, it's not Scooby. And then I just went ahead you know to the neighbouring lane. What? It's not my dog. I'm not going to pick him up. So I went to this neighbouring lane okay and in mah neighbouring lane there's a temple. And outside the temple there is a fat bitch. What? A female dog is also called a bitch. I don't call women bitches. Unless they want me to, then I do. But anyway, so this fat bitch is a big dog! A big big bitch sitting outside the temple. Because every person eats half the sweet and gives her the rest. So this fat bitch has now become a cow. And she's just sitting outside the temple like that. But now I am looking, behind this fat cow who is that? It's Scooby. Scooby is behind the cow and he's just like... He was doggy styling. Or as he likes to call it, styling or whatever. He's does that and mah dad is like... "Oh mah God, this is Scooby. Scooby don't! Scooby don't! Scooby don't!" I'm like, "Dad, it's not Scooby Don't. It's Scooby Do. Scooby Do. Scooby Do. Do it more." And my dad is very pretty annoying. He doesn't even want to let Scooby have sex in peace. He's like, "Scooby don't! Scooby don't!" And you know what Scooby does? He's fucking like that okay? And he turns around. "What is it? What's yosulf's problem? Do I come to yosulf's room when yousulf is having sex? Get out." I've been living in Bombay for like 3 years, you know. I stay in a very pretty small, 4BHK in LW. Lokhandwala. But it is very pretty small. Only 10 lakh rupees a month. It's very pretty tough mah life. Very pretty annoyed. But one thing I noticed, the other day right? I met with an accident. Because this idiot has stopped at a red light before me. I'm driving, he stopped at red light and I banged into him. And then he comes out and he's like... "Bro, you're drunk." I'm like, "Umm, no! I've had only 8 drinks, I'm buzzed at best." He's like, "Bro, why is yosulf not looking on the road and driving?" I'm like, "Because I'm texting. How do I text and look at the road at the same time? Bloody idiot." I said, "Were you texting?" He said, "No!" I'm like, "Yosulf should also look on the road, yosulf should look at the rear view, see I am coming fastly and get out of my way. You fucking idiot." Stopping at a red light. Loser. You know who is the most excited to see an accident? Those unemployed mofos on the side of the road. Have you seen those guys standing like that? We fuck up, they are the most excited. "Boss, what happened? Boss what happened? What happened? Tell me. I'll tell you what happened? What happened, what happened?" I'm like, "How will you tell me, you idiot? You were scratching your balls two minutes back. What you're a lawyer now?" Seriously there is so much pointless employment in Bombay, it's not even funny. Like the other day I went to this mall, what is that? Palldiyum. I went in and the security guard okay, he comes and this James Bond comes and knocks on mah window. He's like... "Sir, can you please open the glove compartment?" I'm like, "Why? What do you want to do see my RC book, insurance papers what?" He's like, "No sir. I want to check if you have a gun." So I'm like, "Come here. Put your head inside, come here. This is a glove compartment. Not a gun compartment. Nobody keeps their gun in the glove compartment. What you think ISIS has made this whole plan "Bro, we have a very pretty fantastic place. We'll hide there. Nobody will know. Yes sir, where? We can hide it in the glove compartment." So I went to the sea-link the other day, okay? And like 20 metres away from the booth, there's a guy who's job is to do this. I'm like very pretty thanks, bro! Because it couldn't call me, I was just going to drive into the sea. And then 10 metres away, there's another guy who's job is like... "Hey, keep the change ready. Keep the change ready." I'm so very pretty confused. I'm like do you work for sea-link or you a beggar? What are you? Then you reach the booth and then you give your money to the guy outside the booth who gives it to the guy inside the booth. Puts in it and then he gives it to the guy outside the booth who gives it to you. That's 4 peoples. 4 peoples. And just when you thought it's over, guess what, it's not. Because there is another guy who's job is to do this. Bloody idiots. No but like seriously. People ask me, "Bro, why do you want to become an actor?" I'm like, "Umm! Bro! I don't want to become an actor. I am an actor." Seriously. Yeah! Make some fucking noise. Anyway and becoming an actor is a very pretty tough job. You know you have to do a lot of things. You know a lot of preparations. Like what I did. I joined the gym. It's very pretty, like I bought all the latest equipment, you know. You know wireless headsets, Nike headband, wrist band, shock absorbing shoes. I got Fitbit, whatever. You know, I have a trainer who's put me on a very pretty strict routine. On Monday I do bicep, on Tuesday I do back bicep. On Wednesday I do chest bicep. Thursday I do shoulder bicep. On Friday I do bicep bicep. And you know everybody's like, "Hey Vicky, when do you do legs?" I'm like, "Umm bro! I don't need to because I wear jeans." You know I keep going for auditions every time. And the casting director sends you text messages telling you where the audition is, what to wear, who to sleep with, who to not sleep with. It's very pretty important information. So this one day I got a text message, it said... "Audition for Redstar batteries. Must have rockstar look." I'm like fuck yeah! I'm a fucking Bon Jovi kinda guy anyway. Check. And the second part said must have lean body. I'm like wow look at this. I would fuck mahsulf. Check. Next part said must be long. Double check. And last part said must be Indian version of Brad Pitt. So I went. I'm like why don't you just write in the message that you want Vicky Malhotra. No seriously. Brad and I have the same jawline like I would be the one divorcing Angelina. But herself has not met me and so it's not happening. And so I love going for auditions like the other day I went for an audition for pregnancy test. Yea, so I go for the audition and the casting director comes to me and he's like... "Okay bro, this is an improvised audition. In this your wife is going to tell you she is pregnant and whatever your reaction is, is the audition. I'm like wow! So very pretty easy. Like I love improvising because once you date 18 chicks at the same time, you have to be good at improvising. I'm like Kewl. I'm good, I'm improviser. Everything. Bring it on! He's like, "Kewl, are you ready?" I'm like, "Yes, one second! Yes ready!" He said, "Action!" I'm like, "Yes, hi Priya! Mahsulf Vicky this side and yosulf? Can you please make butter chicken?" And then he's like, "Cut! Cut! Cut!" I'm like, "What happened?" He's like, "Why is yosulf asking her for butter chicken?" I'm like, "Umm, because I like butter chicken? And she's my wife." He's like, "Bro! No, no, no! She's pregnant, she's telling you she's pregnant, don't talk to her about food or whatever." I'm like, "Okay, kewl!" He's like, "Are you ready for your next take?" I said, "Yes!" Ready! Action! "Yes, hi Priya! Vicky this side and yosulf? The food was very pretty okay but my stomach is hurting and I've got really like pain or whatever." And again he is saying cut. I'm like, "What happened now?" He's like, "Why are you still talking about that?" I said because she made fuck all butter chicken. Her mother has not taught her anything. She makes fuck all butter chicken. That's spicy. Bloody I got acid reflux. And he's like, "Bro! Bro! Bro! You listen it's not about the food or whatever. Like you had the butter chicken, you've gone to the doctor. You had digestives, it's five days later... And like she's telling you she's pregnant, how will you react?" I'm like, "Kewl!" He's like, "Cool! Are you ready?" I said, "Yes!" Ready! Action! I'm like, "Yes hi Priya, masulf Vicky this side and yosulf? Who's fucking baby is that?" Again he is saying cut. He's like, "Why is yosulf asking her about who's baby that is. It doesn't fucking matter who's baby it is. It could be my baby..." I'm like, "Oh my God! You motherfucker. You have been having sex with my wife? Behind my back?" And then even my wife is like, "No actually, it's not his." I'm like, "Shut up you fucking bitch. You fucking lied to me?" I cannot cannot act. I told them I want to get out of here because I cannot act in an ad where my director has had a kid with my wife. It's very pretty uncomfortable for masulf. And I just left. But I still love going for auditions. I still love going for auditions. You know because very pretty sexy chicks come for auditions. Wow! I love it. You know nowadays there's a lot of Brazilian chicks coming to auditions. And Brazilian chicks are like Indian chicks with Amaro filter anyway. No, no! You're pretty. You're pretty. Okay, but that's a trend right? Nowadays like all these chicks come from abroad countries. And they don't know how to speak in Hindi. And they become top actress. Like Katrina Kaif, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sunny Leone, Upen Patel... They all are very pretty successful. You know why? It's because cleavage has no language. Cleavage has no language. It's everywhere. Yes I understand what you say. You know but I've also been selected for independent film. You guys know independent films? Independent film? Yea I've been selected for independent films but it is the worst thing to do. Because independent films are independent of money. They have no money. All beggars. Poor people. I went on set and I find out that my vanity van is a fucking tree shade. Now I was very pretty hungry. I went on set you know. I wanted my high protein soya and chicken salad, so I was like, "Where is the spot boy?" And suddenly one guy comes to me and he's like, "Excuse me sir. The spot boy is a little busy. He is taking a shot right now." I'm like, "Oh my God! The spot boy is also the cinematographer?" And he looks at me like, "Yea, bro! Everyone's done two-two rolls. So you are seventh lead and you are makeup boy. I'm like, "Umm! No! I'm going to be fuck-off-boy. And you're going to be suck-mah-dick-boy. I'm out." Then people are like, "Bro! You should join theatre if you want to become an actor." I said, "Umm! No! You should join theatre if you want to become poor." Like seriously. I don't want my daily wage to be 7 rupees and half cup of tea. Like seriously. I can't do that. I've gone to a lot of theatres. You know I see these guys wearing Khadi, Kurtas, you know. Holding that skull in their head. "To be or not to be!" I'm like, "Bro, come! Let me help you out. Please don't be a theatre actor. It's simple. Because like theatre is lot like movies, except nobody is shooting it and nobody seeing it. It's a good joke, I know. No, that's why I just love like regular movies. Like my favourite genre of movie is sex comedy. I also like sex drama. Sex thriller, sex action. Sex period film, oh wait! That can't happen. You can't do sex period. So bro, you know the joke is what happens... you can't have sex during periods. That's the problem. But you know, I know you guys are looking at me and thinking and oh fuck, he's such a casanova kinda guy. I know, I know. I can see it in your eyes. Like wow! How is he a casanova player? But there is a very other side to mahsulf. You know, important thing that I want to talk to you guys. It's about this gal, I was in love with. And she was in love with mahsulf. Her name was Lovely. And I was her lovely. So Lovely and I were having a very pretty good relationship till one day she told me that she is going for office trip. And that she is going on Saturday and she's going to come on Monday. Okay? So obviously I called another chick home. Seriously. I'm a very gentleman kinda guy, also. I'm not going to tell this chick's name. I will just call her Busty. So Busty... I still get dreams about that sometimes. You know, so Busty and I were at mah house and out of nowhere Lovely shows up. Lovely shows up. She catches me and she's like, "I want to break up with yosulf!" And she broke up with me. I was so sad. I was so sorrow. I was like oh my God. Yosulf is breaking up with mahsulf? Like seriously? I trusted you. I put mah belief in you, you know I wanted you, you wanted me, we wanted love. Then why did you cheat on me like that? Why did you tell me you are coming on Monday and then come on Sunday? It's a complete break of trust. If you've had just kept your word and come on Monday and not on Sunday, we would still be together. That's why all the gals here, I just want to tell you all one thing. Okay? If tomorrow, you tell your boyfriend that you are coming on Monday, then don't come on Sunday. If you come on Sunday, then you message him. And for some reason if he can't reply to your message because maybe if he's handcuffed to a bed? Don't come to his house. And if you come to the house and you come inside, you'll see another girl's shoes and her bra, then don't come to the room. If you reach outside the room and you can hear sounds like, "Oh wow Vicky! More more, amazing. You're so big!" Do not open the door. It's simple physics. Simple physics. No but the two weeks, when Lovely and I were together, she taught me very many things about gals. You know, all you guys, all will agree with mahsulf when I say this. When women say that they're fine, they are not fine. Then once Lovely was angry and I asked, "Listen why are you angry?" She's like, "I'm not angry." I'm like, "Okay kewl! Wanna have sex?" And... She was like, "Why will I have sex with you? I am angry with you." I said. "You said yosulf is not angry." She's like, "You tell me why I am angry?" I'm like, "Why is yosulf playing KBC with me? Like seriously tell me what you feel? Just tell me what you feel." You know ladies tell me... if tomorrow you're going to eat a sandwich and you go to the sandwich guy and you want to eat a chicken sandwich but you tell the guy mutton sandwich. And then the guy gives you mutton sandwich. Then you can't get pissed off and say why you giving me mutton sandwich, I want chicken sandwich. He'll be like, "You didn't tell me you wanted chicken sandwich." And then you'll say, "Can you not tell from my face that I want chicken sandwich?" No! He cannot tell you because he doesn't know what a chicken sandwich face looks like. Seriously. Like another thing that chicks do na. They always keep cribbing like gals. I swear to God. They are so annoying! They just look at the cupboard all the time and they're like, "Oh my God! I have no clothes. Oh my God! I have no clothes." Her cupboard was full. It was more stuffy than Siddhivinayak on Tuesday. She' s like, "Oh my God! I don't have any clothes." I'm like, "Lovely! You have eyes. Your cupboard is full of clothes. You can dress up half of Africa." And then if they are not worried about their clothes, they are worried about themselves. They're like, "Oh mah God! Mah hair is not looking good, mah face is not looking good. I have cellulite, mah hips have become big." I'm like, "Listen Lovely, all that is true. But like telling me again and again is not going to make it go away." Guys, am I right guys? Like seriously, I can help you out. Why don't you keep that cupcake down and go for a jog? Seriously like you can't talk about women and not talk about their driving. Like seriously. It's fantastic. The best comedy show ever. Why is it that everytime a woman is driving and it seems like she is driving for the first time? Like seriously, I don't understand this. Have you seen women parallel park? Oh my God! The best way for chicks to parallel park is to give it to a guy. It's okay ladies, I'm a sexist kinda guy. I told you all first only. You get what you see. You get this. This is sexist. No seriously, I don't know what the problem is. Sexist is amazing. You know the other thing that I don't like with chicks, I don't like watching movies with chicks. Oh my God, like seriously. Like we are watching movie and they'll be like, "Oh! What is happening now? Who dies? *gibberish*" I'm like, "Listen, did you have to interrupt our make out session to ask me that? Why yosulf is asking me about the movie? My name is Vicky not Wikipedia." Like seriously, like. And you know, we were watching Interstellar. She didn't understand Interstellar. How dumb is this chick? I'm like Interstellar is so very pretty easy. You guys know right? It's a movie about two astronauts who travel on a spaceship, who go through a wormhole to break the space-time continuum to meet the Lazarus colony who created the Tesseract in which Coop goes and uses gravity to talk to his daughter and thus save the human race. It's very pretty simple. You know but apart from chicks also, another thing I absolutely love is music. I love music. I'm a musical kinda guy. I am very musical. You know like my favourite genre of music is EDM. EDM! Make some noise if you like EDM. For all you illiterates who do not know what EDM is, EDM stands for Extremely Dance Music. And then you start dancing like this. Fuck! And the best part is they don't have lyrics. They don't have lyrics. It's the most fantastic thing because lyrics don't make you dance. Simple. Like how many times have you heard a Javed Akhtar lyrics and said, "Oh, I'll have to dance on it. Birds, rivers, air..." No, you don't do that. We don't do that. You just need beats. You just need beats. It's like... It's just beats. Like seriously, if I was not a very pretty successful actor, I would be a DJ. I would be a DJ for sure. I already have my DJ career planned out. You know I've got a black T-shirt, I got sunglasses. A laptop. I can make a heart. Look at this heart. It's like it's beating. And I can say put your hands up in the air in 14 languages. Like if you look at people's blood, you'll see like red blood cells, white blood cell. In me you'll see red blood cell, white blood cell and beats. Fuck, this guy has beats in his blood. No seriously. Most people's heart beats dhak dhak. You know how my heart beats? *mimics electronic music beats* Put your hands up in the air! You don't have to talk to anybody. Just slap someone on the face, kick someone on the balls. So very pretty amazing. Beats came out, sorry. You know most people think that models and successful actors are dumb. Let me tell you, we're not! You know like, I'm a very pretty political kinda guy. I am very political. You know, I am very pretty amazed with what happened recently. You know finally President Trump has become the Prime Minister of America. After he became the Prime Minister, I also had like an executive order. He's like Muslims are not allowed from 7 countries. I was like, "Oh mah God!" I was so sad, I was so shocked. I was horrified. I was like shit, how can you do that? How can you not have Pakistan on the list? Seriously. But anyway, I am very pretty happy that President Trump won and not that bloody Hillary. Oh my God! Seriously. If Hillary would have won, they would've talked about other stuff like oh welfare, education, equal rights. And all peh peh peh! Boring! But with Trump America is amazing. Like Trump has said you do whatever you want. You can hit black people, you can shoot someone, you can say Muslim fuck off. Grab pussy, whatever you want. Whatever you want. And people keep saying, "Hey bro listen. You know Trump does not have any political experience." I'm like, "Hello! Have you even become the secretary of your building? Or class monitor? No! Then how can yosulf tell me what Trump wants to do. Like fuck that. And honestly, who does yosulf want to see as first lady? You want to see Melania Trump or that fucking Bill Clinton? Let me tell you. Bill Clinton looks fuck all in a gown. Very pretty fuck all. I do not want him as the first lady. But this election gave me a lot of hope you know. Because it has shown to people that in America, anybody can become Prime Minister. Anybody. Anybody. Which is why I have decided that in 2020, Vicky Malhotra will run for President of America. And when Vicky becomes Prime Minister of America, he's going to make America great again! Again! Thank you guys! Oh mah God, I can see your ugly faces. I'm sure it's been a privilege, for you guys to see me. I am sure, you had a wonderful time. You know all you sexy chicks if you want to meet me backstage, take a photo with me, have sex, whatever. Just let me know. But before I go I have to prove it to my dad that I am very pretty successful comedian also. So you guys have your masks? Wear the mask. Alright, everybody. Where is that cameraman? Hey idiot! Are you guys ready? Alright, at the count of three. One, two, three! Mahsulf Vicky this side! (crowd) And Yosulf Alright, thank you so much guys. You've been very pretty fantastic. I hope you had a good time. And kindly fuck off and don't drink and drive. Actually drink and drive. Or do whatever the fuck you want. You've been absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much.
