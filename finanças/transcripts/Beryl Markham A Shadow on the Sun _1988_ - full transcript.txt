Mama can't take you everywhere. Silly boy. [calm tribal music continues] [dramatic music] - [Guard] Halt. - Sorry, Citi. Thanks for lunch. - [Guard] Stop her. [guns firing] [dramatic music continues] - Oh, Madam. Madam, Madam. What happened? What happened? Do you need help? - Yes, I do. Help me. Yes, help me. Kibii, yes. - Are you all right? - Bloody man tried to, what do you call it? Hijack me. - [Bror] Are you sure it wasn't the military? - He pushed poles across the roadway. - You've just had the honor of being the first European to be shot at today, Beryl. - There's been an attempt at coup d'etat, dear. - Really? Well nobody told me. I could have been. [laughing] Well I was, wasn't I? Oh, thank you, George. That was very good. Hello, young man. Who are you? - Well, I'm Arthur Kane. We talked this morning. - Oh, yes. He's the man I came to see. - [Arthur] Listen, if you're not feeling well, I'd be glad to talk to you another time. - No, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. Though you certainly couldn't tell from the way the men around me are going on. Come, young man. I'm absolutely famished. And I want to hear all about America. Why don't we start with another voddie? George, bring the bottle, will you? Your magazine, what do they want for their money? - How do you mean? - I'm not selling the secrets of my life, Arthur. May I call you Arthur? - Why, sure. Call me whatever you like. Well, we're a literary magazine, not a scandal sheet. So what they want is serious journalism, not gossip. What we would like to do is write a story about you and "West For The Night". - Meaning, I suppose, that you want to know how much of it I wrote, and how much Raoul wrote. - Well, wouldn't you like to kill the rumors? - Rumors? Is that the stuff of serious journalism? I wish I'd never written the bloody book. Did you read it? Did anybody read it? It was my life. Not Raoul, not anybody could have written about my life. - Wait a minute, Mrs. Markham. I have traveled over 8,000 miles to talk to you. There's no point addressing me like a public meeting. I believe that you wrote the book. So, why don't you and I get together and convince everybody else? Would you mind if I use this? Testing, one, two. Okay. I'm listening. - [Beryl] It was a long time ago, nearly 80 years. - [Hugh] I'm gonna build a nation here. - [Beryl] My father bought some land at Njoro, and then sent for us. - Further than the eye can see. A new world, in Africa. - Well, water supply certainly doesn't seem to be a problem. - My dear, Charles, one thing to learn about Africa is that everything is a problem. Plentiful supply of water this year, but next. - Ah, here they come. - Daddy, Daddy. Daddy. - [Hugh] I'll get on my way. - No, no. Stay and meet Clara. She's heard so much about you. - No, Charles. I'll leave you and your family to settle in. New life, new world. Enjoy it, meet it, fight it. Tackle it together. Good luck. It's God's country, when you remember he created it. - [Charles] Richard. - Daddy, Daddy. - [Charles] Hello, Beryl. Welcome to Njoro, my dearest. - Richard's not very well. - Oh dear I'm truly sorry to hear that you're poorly, poorly. [suspenseful music] [calm music] [speaking in foreign language] - You get, you get. Out! Go on. - [Beryl] Daddy, what are you doing? - [Charles] You'll see. It won't be long now. [dramatic music] - I can't take much more of this, Charles. - Take what, old girl? - Africa. - [Beryl] I like Africa. - I was about to announce a little family celebration. - To celebrate what? - The dawn of civilization in this particular corner of Njoro. [all talking at once] - What's the matter, Richard? - I don't feel well. - Come inside, love. You have no idea what this life is like for me. - [Charles] I know it's difficult, but you must be patient. Things are getting better all the time. - [Clara] I can't go on. I've tried. God knows I've tried. - Please. - This is your life, not mine. Nothing is sacred here. - [Charles] Marriage is an obligation, my dear. - [Clara] Pray please, for what? - [Charles] Please, don't let's say anything we might regret afterwards. - [Clara] I can't keep up this life. I can't stay any longer. I'm taking the children home. - [Charles] I won't let you. They'll stay here with me, in their home. - [Clara] What kind of a life can you give them? [whispering continues] - Beryl. I want to tell you something. You can play with him in a minute. You know Richard hasn't been very well. Well, I'm going to take him home to see a doctor, and try and make him better. Daddy and I talked about it last night, and you'll stay here with Daddy while we're away. - I don't want you to go. - Well, think of Richard, dear. You want him well again, don't you? - Yes. - Well, there are good doctors in England. And they'll do everything they can. - What's England? - England is our home, where we come from, where we really live. I want you to be a brave little girl, and help Daddy until. I mean. Well, you've always loved him and it's better this way. [somber music] - Up you come, old boy. - Beryl? - Yes. - This is for you, my dearest. It was my mother's. It's yours now. When you look at it, think of me. [calm music] - Our people do not cry like this. You must learn not to have fear. You are an African now. [dramatic music] - How did you know? - [Arthur] You told me, Beryl. - Did I? Clever. Not just now. We'll have you a little later, sweetie. Now where was I? - [Arthur] Well, your mother had just left. - Oh, no. Let's go on beyond that, much later than that. Daddy. - What is it? - Arap Maina told me you've got something for me. - Oh yes. - Oh, Daddy. He's lovely. - Now you make damn sure you look after him. He's just like a little bull. I shall call him Buller. Thank you. - Yes. Well, don't pull me down. - After a while my father did build us a proper house, on the hill. He tried to give me an education. But all I really needed to learn, I learned from the Africans. [speaking in foreign language] We went to town to buy a dress. - We went to town to buy a dress. - Good. - Good. [speaking in foreign language] Good afternoon. How do you do, today? - Good. - The monkeys, look. - [Beryl] I learnt from the animals as well, how to know what's good and bad in the forest. Like the colobus monkey, taking the yellow berries and leaving the black. - [Florence] Whoa. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. How do you do today? - I'm very well, thank you. Who are you? - He's my friend, Kibii. I taught him to say good afternoon. - You taught him very well. What's your name? - Beryl Clutterbuck. We live over at Njoro. - You're a long way from home. Why don't you come over to my house for tea? Your friend can tell your father you're with me. - I don't know who you are. - I'm so sorry. My name is Florence, Florence Delamere. Your father bought his farm from my husband. - He's a Duke, or an Earl, or. - No, just a Lord. Do come. I have a son about your age. [speaking in foreign language] - [Beryl] What's the difference between a Lord and our Lord? - [Florence] Well, one is God. The other only thinks he is. - [Beryl] Are you a Lord? - [Florence] No just a Lady. - I'll be lady when I grow up. - Expect so. You'll have to learn to dress a little differently. [voices overlapping] - Florence, my dear. Just been talking to these Maasai chaps about a fascinating new sheep, a sort of flat tail variety. I thought we might cross breed it with a Merino. Might be something interesting. We might have a new stock. - This is the Clutterbuck daughter, Beryl. - How do you do, my dear? - Mama, we're just going for a gallop. - No your not. This is Beryl Clutterbuck, and she's staying for tea. - Hello. - Hello. [speaking in foreign language] - [Beryl] Daddy, Daddy? - What is it? - Daddy. Could you come with me to the Delamere's? Daddy, will you? - Come out? Can't you see I'm busy? - They're holding a party for me. - Party for you? What on Earth for? - Well, it's my birthday. - You should have told me. - [Beryl] All I want you to do is come to the party. - I've got far too much to do here. [somber piano music] I'm sorry I forgot. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] - Kibii, come on! [suspenseful music] [hog squeals] You taught me. [lion growls softly] [lion growls] - Beryl. Beryl, Beryl. Beryl. [horse neighs] [lion growls] - [Arthur] So you never actually went to a real school? - [Beryl] There were endless Governesses. I always managed to get rid of them. - Allow me. - Thank you. - Oh, Beryl. This is Mrs. Orchardson, your new governess. - Hello. I'm sure we're going to get on splendidly. - [Charles] Well. Let's get you settled in. - One morning, M-O-R-N-I-N-G, at the end of July, J-U-L-Y, a young man and four boys were- [calm piano music] [crickets chirping] - Beryl. It's time for bed time. - Daddy? - Time you were in bed. I need you to be quiet. - You asked me to play the piano. - I asked you to play it, not destroy it. Now of you go. [sour notes play] [door slams] [calm music] [dramatic music] - [Beryl] It was a gilded childhood. - Richard. - Beryl. Hey, Beryl. Oh, hi. - It's so nice that you came back. - Summer holidays for us. - I know. - School starts again in the Autumn. - You like school? You wrote a letter, and it sounded very frightening. - It's alright now. Mother sends her love. She says she'll be coming back to Kenya. But I have a feeling it's just- - Talk. Come on. Arap Maina's leaving. He's going to be a soldier. Kibii and me are going to see him off. - I want to stay here and finish these. - Richard? - I want to finish these sketches before I go home. - But they'll be a band and everything. Kibiis' father's going off to the war. - I should be enlisting in two years time. - Will the war be going on for two years? - The Housemaster says it will. - [Beryl] Are you glad? - We all have to do our duty, for King and country. - [Beryl] Come on. [coughing] [speaking in foreign language] [military cadence music] Arap Maina never came back. - My brother always received the silliest school reports. They measured his height when he first arrived at boarding school. And at the end of term my father received the first school report, which said that at the beginning of term John was four foot, five. But at the end of term he was four foot, four and a half. [all laughing] Oh no, no. The joke was the Headmaster's comment. John seems to be settling down well. [all laughing] [coughing] Beryl, give him some water. - Settling down well, so funny. [coughing resumes] [voices overlapping] [beads rattling] [speaking in foreign language] [birds singing] [somber music] [speaking in foreign language] - You'll come back, Kibii. - Everything between us will be changed. I will be your servant. I will call you Mensa. I must live with my people, and you with yours. - You'll be a fine man, and a fine warrior. It was Kibby's turn to leave home. Goodbye. To be initiated into the ripeness of manhood. With his going, my own childhood ended. - I'd better go. - Go? Isn't there a curfew on? - No they've canceled it. Panic's over I guess. You still up to it tomorrow at 10? - Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day. - Where does a young girl learn Shakespeare in the middle of the jungle? - She's come a long way. - [Charles] I don't know what she'd have done without you. - I'm very fond of her. She's the daughter we never had. [bell ringing] - [Beryl] Kibii, Kibii! - Mensa, you did well. - [Beryl] He's the one who did it. - [Kibii] He did well too. - I'm afraid my pony went lame in the last shuffle. - Oh, I'm sorry. Hope it wasn't my fault. - No, no. I thought you played superbly. - Thank you. - Thirsty? - No, not just yet. It was at that match that I met the man, who to answer your question, taught with me Shakespeare in the jungle. - Beryl. I don't believe you've met, Denys Finch Hatton. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Jock says you're a brilliant polo player. From a man with his reputation in the game, I would say that was quite a compliment. - [Jock] Beryl really knows how to talk to horses. - I do not. - [Jock] Yes, you do. I've seen you're muttering to them, like a witch doctor. - I'm hopeless at polo. - Denys is a hunter. - Well more of a tour guide these days, really. Would you like to come on safari with me some time? - [Beryl] I'd love it. - I'll bring her along. All you have to do is ask us. - Gentlemen, I hate to take Beryl away from you. There's someone I'd really like you to meet. Excuse me. - [Arthur] Is that when Denys Finch Hatton and Karen Blixen were lovers? - No, no no. That was much later. - [Arthur] They never married. - No. - And your father never married Emma Orchardson. - No. In the old days, they used to ask, are you married or do you live in Kenya? No one ever asked Karen if she wrote "Out of Africa". Why do they always ask me? - [Arthur] Perhaps because you had never written anything before. - I have a lot of notes. Little efforts, sketches, beginnings. I never kept a diary. There was always too much going on. [contemplative music] - If the rains don't come soon, we're gonna be in real trouble. - Oh, don't worry, dear. They always have. [contemplative music continues] [horn honking] - Good morning. - [All] Morning. - How do you like my new Fiat? - [Emma] Oh, it's beautiful. There can't be another in all Africa. - I collected her in Mombasa last week, hell of a good ride home with her. Anyone like a spin? - [Emma] We have to do the accounts. - [Charles] I've contracted to supply 2000 tons of grain. - You'll be able to afford one of these yourself. - If I get a crop this year. - [Emma] Why don't you take Beryl? - Oh, ah. What about it? - Why not? [calm music] - [Charles] I've asked Jock to join us for Christmas dinner. - Oh? - He's taken quite a shine to you, old girl. He's a good man. - Are you trying to make a match, Father? - Well, you could do worse. [somber music] [music intensifies] Disaster. - 92 pounds. Any more than 92 pounds? That's 92 pounds then. And finally, the last lot of the sale. Lot 128, showing here, a fine stallion imported from England, from the estate of the aristocratic. We'll start bidding at 50 guineas, then. 50, thanks, sir. 50 on my left. 50, 60. 70, 80. 90 guineas, 90 guineas, 100 guineas, 100, 110. 120, 130 a new bidder. 130 guineas. Any more? 140. 150 guineas now. That's 150 guineas, then. Any more? That's 150. - 160. - 160 from the gentleman in the corner there. - 165.I'll take- - 200 guineas. - [Auctioneer] 200 guineas from the gentleman. Any more? 200 guineas. 200 guineas. Your name, Sir? - Well, at least now I'll be able to honor the grain contract. - [Emma] Oh, it's all unbearable. - I gave my word. That's all I've got left. - What are we going to do? - [Charles] Oh, something will turn up. - Beryl. I'm sorry. - It happens to farmers. Jock. - What? - Thank you. - For what? - Well, I saw you push up the bid. - What are going to do with the house? - Well, we don't have to be out until July. - Where will you? - We're survivors. We'll survive. - I can't imagine you without Kenya, or Kenya without you. I want to talk to you. Can you come over to my house tonight? Condemned woman's last meal and all that. [laughing] - Father. You all right? - What a damn, fool question. - There's something you might want to know. Jock's asked me to marry him. And I've accepted. I thought you'd be pleased. - I'm delighted, my dear. It'll solve a lot of problems. - [Beryl] Jock was a perfectly nice man. But God knows why I married him. - Maybe just to please your father, or for his money. - Money? I never gave a damn about money in my life. It certainly never stuck to me, as you can see. - No, no no. No more for me. - Come, come. It's good for you. Jock, Jock was a man's man. He did his best to make things work. [hammer banging] Father? Jock's manager's gone, and Jock said that you could have the job, and the managers house to live in. - Yes, he told me. - Well, it is a job. And it keeps you near. - I've got a job, a terrific job, training horses. We leave in the morning. - Leave? - It's in South America. Peru. [somber music] - Don't leave, Father. Please. - I'm sorry, old girl. You're on your own now. [somber music continues] - I've made you some coffee. - Oh, thank you darling. - Oh, Beryl. I found this. Isn't it yours? [somber music continues] - Thank you. - Good morning, Beryl. - What's this? - After last night, you deserve it. - Jock? Can I ask you something? - Go ahead. - I'd like to train horses. May I? - Why not? I've got space, and money enough to back you. - Oh, thank you, Jock. Then I'll ask the Delameres tomorrow. - Why do you want to ask the Delameres? - They know lots of people. They can ask some of their friends. They're all going to be there tomorrow at the party. - Yes. I was gonna suggest we skip it. - Why? It's always the event of the year. - I've never liked it. All those Africans, it's ludicrous. - I like the Africans. - In their place. Delamere spoils them rotten. He's going to ruin this country. - Please, Jock. - Anything you want. Right now, I know what I want. - For those of you who've never done this before, let me explain. This is a game of elimination. And no cheating by pinching someone else's colors. You aim for the heart. [tribal drum music] And now for the bullseye, in both senses. [tribal drum music] [party goers applauding] - [Man] Well done, Beryl. Well done. Well done. [tribal drum music continues] [audience applauding] - The perfect solution, Africa and it's lesser together. Let's hail the winners. - Jock. - Congratulations, darling. - Jock, don't be such a spoil sport. - [Denys] Beryl. - [Beryl] Denys. - Beryl. [Beryl laughing] - [Beryl] Where have you been? - I was late, but not too late to witness your triumph. Jock, wasn't she magnificent? - If you like that sort of thing. - Denys, you old rascal. Late, as usual. - Late, apologetic, but still in a state of grace. - Sit you down with Jock and Beryl. - Housman. - What? - AE Housman. Soldier from the wars returning, spoiler of this taken town. Here is ease that asks not earning. Come you in, and sit you down. - What are you talking about? - Sit you down, it's an odd phrase. I mean normally you'd say, sit down. I'm sorry. - Poetry. - Hah. [gasping] - What the? - Relax, old boy. It's just this year's edition of the Delamere Follies. - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the dance. [tribal drum music] - [Beryl] Come on, Jock. Let's go. - It's just the kind of thing I can't stand. - Jock. [tribal drum music continues] [singing in foreign language] - And to our guests, our talent. One, two, three. ♪ Knees upon the ground ♪ Knees upon the ground ♪ I don't care but we must go ♪ E-I-E-I-E-I-O [all singing different versions of the song] [all cheering] [both songs playing at once] - It's disgusting! It's degrading! Crackpots like the Delameres cavorting with heathens. And simpering idiots like Finch Hatton minsing along. It makes me want to vomit. And my wife, my wife makes a complete spectacle of herself. Have you any idea what anyone decent thinks of you? Have you? Beryl. Beryl, I'm talking to you! [door slams] - I think he's fine. You can take him back. Jock, don't. - In the house. In the house. I'm tired of having a wife who's not a wife. I'm tired of never knowing where you are. This is where you live, in this house, not in those bloody stables! - [Beryl] You're drunk. - You're my wife! [door slams] - Easy, easy. Easy. Easy there. Easy, easy easy. Easy, easy. They've already got their dinner. Easy, baby. - I hope I didn't frighten you. I wasn't sure if you'd seen the lions. Tom Campbell Black. And you can only be Beryl Clutterbuck. - Purves. - Yes, of course. No one else would be mad enough to be riding out here on their own. Well to you the truth, I'd have probably only buzzed the lines, but the engine's been acting up. Spark trouble, I expect. Oh yes. - Your plane looks wonderful. - Transport of the future. But right now, it's the most fun you can have in the world. I'll take you for a flight sometime, if you like, minus the horse. How is Jock? I haven't seen him since before your wedding. I'm sorry I couldn't make it. I was in London. - I've never been to London. Is that where you live? - No, no. Frightful place. I have to go there from time to time. That should do it. Well, I suppose I'd better be going. It's gonna be dark shortly. - Delighted to have met you at last. - [Beryl] Thank you. - Give my regards to Jock, won't you? [contemplative music] [calm music] [hammer beating nails] - He'd become quite insanely jealous, took to hammering nails in the wall every time he thought I had been unfaithful to him, which was almost any time I even spoke to another man. - Well, if you were anything then like you are now, I bet you were a bit of a handful. [chuckles] - Well, I was young. And I'd been used to being. Oh good. I'd been used to being free and easy. Poor Jock. He simply don't know what to do with me. - I've canceled the guests. [china breaking] I told them not to come. [china breaking] Why should I be insulted in my own home by a wife who flirts, [china breaking] and prims, [china breaking] and makes eyes at every male of the species, [china breaking] while she can't stand her own husband even to touch her? [china breaking] That's why. [china breaking] [dramatic music] - [Beryl] I had only one thought, to get away. [dramatic music continues] - Mensa. - What are you doing here? - A woman does not leave her husband. You must go back. Whana Purves is very angry. - I have left Whana Purves for good, or for better. I'm going to train horses here in Molo. I can have my own stable. - Ha! - I am. - A very good idea. A stable with no horses. - I'll get them. - You got money? You got a trainer's license? You'll never get a trainer's license. What you've got is one angry husband, and plenty of trouble. - You like him so much. Why don't you go back to him. He pays you. You've got a job. - You don't know anything. You're putting this on the wrong way. - [Beryl] Hello, D. - [Hugh] Beryl. - Morning. - Morning. - Beryl, we haven't seen you since you. How are you? - I'm fine I'm staying at Molo. It's not too comfy, but I'll be all right. I came to talk to you about a business proposition. I want to start a training stable. I need some horses. I'd handle the rest. And of course I wouldn't ask for any payment of purses. I simply want to build my reputation as a trainer. - But you've never trained horses before. - I've been training my whole life. - Not professionally. - You always said she was a genius with horses. - This is different. - [Florence] Why? - 'Cause they're my horses. Besides, the Jockey Club would never give you a license. - That's my concern. I'll get it. If you'll give me the horses, I'll get the license. - We'd like you to succeed, Beryl. A proper Kenyan training Kenyan horses. I like it. - Miss Clutterbuck. There is no such thing as women trainers. You're asking the Jockey Club to recognize a category that simply doesn't exist. - I'm only asking you to recognize two facts, that I train horses, and that I am a woman. I really don't- - There is no precedent. - For being a woman? I think it started with Eve in the Book of Genesis. - Please, madam. we're not fencing with words here. - That's exactly what you are doing. I came here to ask for a trainer's permit. And you answer me with words like precedent, and category, tradition. The horse doesn't care I'm a woman. [laughing] Owner seems to trust me. - Perhaps as a compromise, Brown-Williams. - [Brown-Williams] Yes? - I am prepared to let miss Clutterbuck's horses run under my name until the full committee can consider your application. - Well, that's very generous, Sir Antony. What do you think of that, Miss Clutterbuck? - That's very kind of Sir Antony. - Then we have agreement? - I will agree to run two horses under Sir Antony's name. But if either one of the horses wins, then you owe me my permit. [horses running hard] [shouting in foreign language] - Belgian Lad's a natural two miler. - But is he ready to race? - It's the only way we're ever gonna earn any money. - Mensa, they're going to cut off our supplies. No money, no oats. - I know. - The blacksmith, he's- - I know. - For my people, it's okay. But you've had no meat for maybe- - Don't worry about me, Kibii. - You will get sick. [shouting in foreign language] - I will find a way. How much will you lend me for this? - Blinker him. - What? But he's never in his life had- - [Beryl] I said blinker him. - But, Mensa- - Kibii. Just do as I say. Don't ever question my decisions again. Hold him back until two furlongs out. [tribal drum music] - I don't believe it. Why Beryl, you're praying. - The jockey's got my horse, his skill, and his whip. But I think God can do more. [tribal drum music continues] Hold him back. I've got the best jockey in Kenya riding on him. I've got my livelihood riding on him. [tribal drum music continues] Oh, he's gone too soon. - No he hasn't. [crowd cheering] - Sir Antony. - Excellently trained I'd say. You've excelled yourself. [applauding] [calm party music] - Beryl. - This is bloody good booze. Who's paying for it? - You are, darling. Beryl, I would like to meet Mansfield Markham. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Congratulations on your winner. - Oh, thank you. I don't suppose you'd care to dance with a complete stranger? - Are you the complete stranger? - Incomplete, unless we can dance together all evening. - Oh, well. [laughing] [calm party music continues] - Thank you. [gun firing] - Now's your chance. [gun fires] - Now, if you'd like to do that again with spirit. I just love this country. Don't you love it? Nobody who has ever loved Africa can ever escape it. It haunts you until you die. - Could you ever think of leaving it? - No, never. - Just for a few weeks. - No. - Even for your honeymoon? - Oh, Mansfield, it's too... - It's too what? It's too soon? Too sudden? - Too perfect. - Marry me, Beryl. Right away. - Yes, yes. [sultry music] - I knew you would. - Oh, you did? - Yeah, when you pulled your shot and let me win. [laughing] [calm piano music] That one's good. Well any, or all of them. They're yours. Just so long as I reserve the right to choose the underwear. - [Beryl] I've never seen anything like this in my life. - [Mansfield] Well, a girl can't wear a loincloth in Paris. - Oh, Darling. It seems like a dream. Everything, the ship, the Orient Express, Istanbul, Paris. Oh, could I wear this one tonight? - Isn't that a little too dressy? I mean the natives will spot you as an outsider right away. - But I am an outsider. - My darling little outsider. That's why I adore you. That's why it's gonna be so wonderful to mold you into my wife. [speaking in foreign language] [calm music] [speaking in foreign language] - It's Kibii. He said he was getting a bite to eat. I never thought he'd wind up here. [laughing] [speaking in foreign language] - Wogs against the frogs, my dear. And may the better man win. - No no, no no. No no, no no, no. - Mrs. Mansfield Markham. This is Uncle Anthony, He was the black sheep of the family, until I went to live in Africa became pure devilish. - Welcome, my dear. - Thank you. - At least I'll earn my living, something Mansfield finds too vulgar to do. - Oh, yes. Beryl earns her living too. - [Mother] Does she? - Oh, Mother. This is Beryl. Yes, she earns her living training horses. Don't you, my dear? - Yes. - And she's very successful at it too. - Well, you'll soon have other responsibilities. Come and have tea. You sit beside me my dear, and we'll get to know each other better. You must find our climate so different. - [Beryl] Oh yes, it's very much wetter. I should have known then, in those cold drafty halls, what my marriage would become, but I didn't yet. I tried to be perfect. Oh, damn. Damn. - Talented girl you are, Beryl. Oh, I believe that's Mansfield back. Come and give him a kiss. Did you have a good day, darling? - Lovely. Well, you didn't marry mother, dear. You married me. My mother's completely Victorian. But don't ignore the virtues of the Victorians. They built that empire you're so attached to. - Thank you, sir. May I have your name? Thank you. Now then, gentlemen. Next lot in your catalog, number 28. Two celebrate mares from the Wilmot Stud. One six year old chestnut, one four year old dapple gray. I already have a bid of- - Mensa, come look at this one. [horse neighs wildly] - He's a beauty. What's wrong with him? - Bad blood, Ma'am. - Vicious, that's what he is Ma'am. Kicked a groom to death. Nobody's gonna buy him. They all know. - [Auctioneer] Messenger Boy. Messenger Boy, out of Triple J, by the late great brother. - But like governor says, there's always some fool, even for the worst horse. His sister just fetched 2000 guineas, straight up. - Not that one. Come on. Ma'am. - Ma'am. - [Auctioneer] Anyone for 25? Going, gone for 25. Sold to the lady for 25 guineas. Your name please, Madam? - [Beryl] Markham. [calm music] - Beryl, I should be thoroughly displeased with you, taking my son away. I know you're both very keen on this Kenya. Once you've had children, you will have to come scuttling home, so they can be properly educated. [tense music] - [Beryl] Come, I want to show him to both of you. - [Hugh] What's that, your man eater? - [Beryl] My very inexpensive winner. - [Florence] Well, it's very generous of Mansfield to indulge you like this. - [Mansfield] Well, Beryl says he's gonna make us both famous. [horse neighs wildly] [calm music] - Mensa, he's crazy. I can't get near him. - [Beryl] Here, boy. Steady. Here, boy. Easy, darling. Easy, darling. [tense music] [inspirational music] Come on, boy. Come on, darling. [calm music] Keep him in line. [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] [dramatic music] To Messenger Boy, who actually did it. But most of all, to my husband, who has made all of this not only possible, but wonderful. To Messenger Boy, and to Mansfield. [crowd all talking at once] - And I believe my wife's birthday present has arrived. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Beryl ♪ Happy birthday to you - Lovely party. - Jolly tiring though. - Darling. I thought. - What? - I thought you'd be happy to know I'm pregnant. - That's wonderful news, my dear. - It's due in February. - February, huh? Of course that'll mean we have to return to London. - Why? Kenya's our home. - All the Markham's had been born at Markham Court since time began. Besides, much as we love Africa, Darling, it's not exactly the best place for doctors, is it? - You see, Mansfield reverted to his family upbringing, where a woman's place is in the home, especially if she was pregnant. If you're going to be a disobedient wife, never marry a conventional man. - I'll remember that. - Darling. - [Mansfield] Who on Earth was he? - A messenger, an official messenger. We've been invited to join the royal party on safari. I've given them our acceptance. - I loathe safaris, darling. You know I do. That sort of excitement we don't need at the moment, darling. But it's the Prince of Wales, and Prince Henry. - Well, royalty is unlikely to affect the tedium of plodding after animals in order to slaughter them. You need to be calm. - You really don't have to coddle me, Mansfield. Active mothers have very healthy children. - Well, I despise everything about those hunting safaris. And my interest in the princes is at best, limited. Please make our excuses. - I'd really like to go. - Well, I'd have thought you'd have cared more about our child than some sweat smelling, insect infested safari. - I always had an urge - We're not going. - for self destruction. - That's that. I forbid it. - [Beryl] What I have never been able to resist is a new thrill, or new challenge, even talking to you like this, Arthur. [tribal drum music] [people applauding] - Now a toast to the Royal Highnesses, and the honor they have bestowed upon us by visiting us here in Kenya, in, if I may say so, the prime of their youth. To the Royal Highnesses. - [All] To the Royal Highnesses. - Thank you. - And now, I think we all deserve some lunch. - [William] Isn't that Baroness Blixon? - Her husband left here. Now they say she's having a fling with our friend, Finch Hatton. - Is that the lure of Kenya? - Gentlemen. Beryl. I just heard the news, I'm so very pleased. - How did you know? - Markham, he won't keep it a secret for long. - Now we can't have two of the distaff side whispering together. - Jack, do you know Mrs. Markham? - Oh, I've known Beryl since used to play with bare feet, and a wee bear bum. - I wear considerably more these days. - I hope not. - [William] Mrs. Markham is very attractive. - And only slightly married, by all accounts. - [William] Just don't start getting too serious, Henry. - [Henry] It doesn't count on holiday. - If you say so. But if Father were to hear. - He won't. - Do you not find the presence of royalty very extracting, Beryl? As a woman, I mean. - Mrs. Markham. - Oh. - I understand that you're the only proper native here. I've just been made president of Kew Gardens. God knows why. Would you mind showing me some of the local flora? - Well, I'd be delighted. - Command performance tonight. - I was really quite fortunate, actually. I grew up with the Africans. They taught me everything. Everything of value, that is. - Like what? - How to find food, water. - How interesting. How do they find water? - It's really quite simple, actually. If you trap a baboon. They can smell water, you see. And if you hold it till the poor thing is dying of thirst, then when you release it, you can follow it to its water supply. - That's fascinating, absolutely fascinating. - It's brutal, but necessary. That's the way you learn to survive. - I'm not quite sure what it's called. Injustice, something like that. There is a wall in which the stones, align and writhe in dead men's homes. - No, please everyone. Don't move. Thank you so much. - And wrongfully this evil wall denies what all men may call. And shamefully this wall surrounds our homestead and our native town. - Don't be annoying, Jack. - Come on, Beryl. You know you want it. And he's not going to be giving you the royal initiation, not tonight anyway. - Stop it, Jack. - Come on, Beryl. I saw you without any clothes on 20 years ago. [grunting] [laughing] - Come on, Jack. Keep it tucked in and behave. - [Beryl] It's funny how a little incident can lead to a big consequence. Jack Carberry wasn't going to get out of my life. But we'll get to that later. - There are reports of a herd of elephant a quarter of a mile away, sir. But if you want some real adventure, one of the scouts has found tracks of greater kudu. - Where's the Prince? I must see him at once. - Over there, preparing for the shoot. - Oh forgive us, everyone, please. May I have a word with you, sir? - Certainly, Bradley. This way. - Thank you, sir. - Come on. - Mrs. Markham. Our father is gravely ill. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - It means we have to return at once. - Of course. - I'm sorry we haven't seen more of each other. I hope, well I hope you'll keep in touch. - You've been very gracious. - Henry. - I'd like to see you again. I know you'll be coming to London. It's my private number. Do call. - [William] Henry! - Mrs. Markham, you have a son. - [Mother] No, no. You're going to take off this woolen. The poor dear looks so flush. [baby fussing] - Oh, we thought he looked a little warm, Mum. - There's nothing warm in this entire house. [baby stops fussing] That's a good boy. There we go. - Mansfield will be expecting you for dinner, my dear. - Tell him I'm feeding Gervase. Boy, that is good. Is it good? - Don't wait up for me, darling. [calm jazz music] - Beryl, you're not yet house trained. - And you are not yet palace trained. [all laughing] - Come on, then. [Charleston dance music] - Follow that car. [upbeat piano music] - Excuse me, Madam. There is Mr. Penrose from The Daily Mirror newspaper who asks for a word with you. - [Beryl] Who? - Only a moment of your time, Madam, a most delicate matter. - [Beryl] Thank you, Jamieson. Yes? - We believe that you are a friend, a close friend of His Highness, the Duke of Gloucester. - If you know that Mr. Penrose, then surely you must know that I have no comment. - Naturally, Madam. However, perhaps you can confirm the report that on Wednesday night after dining at the Cafe de Perry, adjoining rooms were taken at the Ritz Hotel, Piccadilly. - [Beryl] I have nothing to say. I'm sure that the palace press office will give you all the details that His Highness' social engagements. [cutlery scraping against plates as clock ticks] - How many times do I have to tell you, Beryl? Leave Gervase to his nanny. It isn't good to coddle him. - [Beryl] I am his mother. - You are, also and foremost, my wife. - When are we going home? - This is home, Beryl, beside me. My son will be brought up in England, as I was. Africa was an interlude, pleasant but it's over, over. You hear me? Over. If you wish return to the jungle, then you do so on your own. My son remains here, his home. [birds singing] - And she was to insist on the band playing up there. [light jazz music] I'm not having any success at cheering you up today, am I, Beryl? What is it? - Oh. It's you, me, here, us. - In that order. I spoke to my brother about us last night. Do you know what a morganatic marriage is? As third in line to the throne, I'd have to contract that any children we might have will- - Please. - Beryl, I love you. I want to marry you. - [Beryl] Henry, it's not possible. - Yes, yes it is. Oh, there'd be one hell of a fuss but- - Henry. Don't spoil this. Come on. [light jazz music continues] - Most grateful to you, Mr. Markham, for coming so promptly. Sir George, our solicitor. - Sir. - How do you do? - We believe the situation has reached a crisis. - The situation? - [Sir George] This is most difficult. - You mean my wife's relationship with Prince Henry? - [Sir George] Exactly, sir. I'm most grateful to you. - It's a cross I've had to bear for some time, sir. My marriage is, for all intents and purposes, now over, Your Majesty. That being so, I hadn't thought it my place to interfere in Beryl's life. - My brother is infatuated, perhaps in love. Mrs. Markham's feelings are, I am told, less strong. - His Majesty has been taking advice from several quarters, Mr. Markham. - And we have a proposition. - I was summoned to the palace this morning. - I am sorry, Mansfield. I really am sorry. - Well, I told them that whatever Prince Henry's feelings were toward you, I didn't believe that you had any hope, or intention of marrying him. Is that correct? - I don't love him. - No. Very well. The palace has agreed to make an ex gratia payment to you, a small annuity for the rest of your life. In exchange, you will end your relationship with the Prince. And I have agreed not to mention him in any divorce action. However, I will arrange for you to return to Kenya within the week. Is that clear? - Yes. - Do you accept? - On one condition. Gervase goes with me. - [Mansfield] Gervase remains her. - He's my son. - He's our son. Gervase is a Markham. You will of course be entitled to see him from time to time, but his custody remains with me. - And if I refuse? - Don't force me, Beryl. - I'm not afraid to face the scandal. - I'll have him made a ward of court. The Prince will be utterly disgraced, the very throne. Now please, Beryl, listen to me. I am offering you your freedom, access to your son, return to Africa, and a sum of money for the rest of your life. Now for the child's sake, and for your own, I hope you'll accept. [somber jazz music] - Mansfield was charming. He had such style. I was always a sucker for style. - Why didn't you write about any of this in your book? - Because it was a memoir, not an autobiography. - All right. And can we talk some more about your decision to go along with his conditions? - I've turned it over in my mind for nearly 50 years. There's nothing more to say. Arthur, let's go on. I went home to find my father in my house. He'd returned, minus Emma Orchardson. - For God's sake, Beryl, you gotta snap out of this. Mansfield is over. The baby is gone. You're back home now, you ought to make a life for yourself. I loathe self pity. - I hardly think you're the one to lecture me on feelings. You were never there when I needed you, ever. You raised me to be on my own and independent. Don't think that you can come back into my life, and tell me how to sort it out. - I was simply trying to do what was best for you, to make you strong enough to stand on your own. I'm afraid I'm not very good at telling people that care for them. I'm sorry, Beryl. - Yes. I'm sorry too, Father. In my pit of despair, I had an unexpected visitor, Tom Campbell Black. - [Tom] The old boy tells me you haven't left the place in a week. - No, Tom. - Let's go flying, shall we? You still want to fly, don't you? [plane engine sputtering and rumbling] - [Beryl] But it wasn't Tom who dropped out of the sky first. Well, hello there. - Beryl! I ran out of bloody fuel, flying around trying to avoid that storm over there. - Oh, Denys. You're a sight for sore eyes. - Get off that nag. Let me borrow it, so I can go and get some fuel. - Oh no you don't. You'll only get lost again. I'll go get it. - At least horses don't run out of petrol. I've got a camp over there. It'll take me a while. Why don't you make yourself useful, try cooking dinner? - I don't know about that, but I do have what we really need. Meager compensation for your promised hospitality. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterday's have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out out, brief candle. Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. The tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. - Nothing! - Nothing! [laughing and coughing] - Tell me. - Yes? - What's been happening to you? - Oh, it's whole new life, a new me. Maybe I'll take up flying. Tom Black says there's a great future in aviation. - Only if you ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere. - I'd love to fly. - [Denys] It's wonderful. - Is it. Maybe you'll teach me. How's Karen? - She's fine - [Beryl] You really have cheered me up, Denys. I wish you'd drop out of the sky more often. - I have to be up there, Beryl. Let me explain. Nor law nor duty bade me fight, nor public men nor cheering crowns. A lonely impulse of delight drove to this tumult in the clouds. - I balanced all, brought all to mind. The years to come seems wasted breath, a waste of breath the years behind, in balance with this life, this death. [calm music] - One, check the windsock. That is your wind direction. Two, check the landing strip. Make sure there are no holes, and no game. Three, make sure that you have sufficient fuel for an overshoot. And four, make sure that your approach speed is 70 miles an hour in gusty conditions. [plane engine sputtering] - [Beryl] I did it! - Correct for yaw, damn you! Reduce throttle. Damn it, don't you people listen? Now climb to 2000 level, heading 180. Excellent, Beryl. You're the only damn one who can do it first time. Now do it again! [audience applauding] - Don't you play tennis, Jack? - Whatever game doesn't exercise the mind is neglecting the only important muscle in the body. - By which he means he only plays to win. - You never said a truer word. - I'm flying to Voy, tomorrow. If you were- - Oh, I'd love it. - Midday prompt. If you're late I'll have to leave without you. - I'll be there. [plane engine humming] - You're crazy trying to land here. - I didn't try, Bror. I landed. My bloody water bottle spilled. I'm absolutely gasping. - You are mad, mad. - Another stunt like that, and you can find yourself another flying instructor. - I'm sorry. - You wouldn't be laughing if your fuel line had been blocked when you took off, would you? In a dust storm, dust take off, check the fuel filter and clear it. How many hours solo have you done? - Just a few more, and I'm licensed. I'll give you extra navigational instruction if you'll stay on here today. - Oh thank you, Tom. I'd love it. But I'm flying to Voy with- - I know. - I'm late as it is, and I've got to go home and get my things. Is there something wrong? - I was just, I don't think Denys is a very safe pilot. - What are you talking about? - I had a dream, and he. I know it's just rubbish. But I do wish you'd stay behind. - You? Of all people? You had a dream? [both laughing] - I don't even believe in such things. I still think he's a rotten pilot. I've seen him up there. He throws the damn thing around as if he'd never heard of down rafts and stalling speeds. And he never files a decent flight plan either. Beryl, stay. - It means a great deal to me. - All right, then. Go! - Right. [calm piano music] - Beryl? [calm piano music continues] Beryl, where are you? Where is she? We're going to be lat for the funeral. Beryl? Beryl? [birds singing] - Oh that African hooch. Oof, I can't drink it anymore. Whatever they say about old age, the real curse is indigestion. The voddie helps. Pour me another, will you sweetie? - Denys is such a myth now. But he wasn't really well known then. I mean he wasn't a world famous flyer, or an air ace like Tom Campbell Black. - No. Denys was a very private man. Women adored him. He was so sensitive, attractive. Who else loved music and language? Who else was so- - Unattainable? - Oh, let's leave him to history, and to Karen Blixen. - Kibii knows more about horses than you or I put together. - I'm sorry, Beryl but I didn't send my horse to be trained by one of your boys. The horses don't care what the color of his skin is. - The point is, Beryl, that I've been paying for your skill, not his. - Stupid man. This is their country. They'll have it back one of these days. I gave you a brilliant trainer. You deserve to wind up with one of those flesh traders. - Sorry, Beryl. - And you haven't paid your bill for nearly two months! Damn you! Damn them all! - Time's up. How did you go? - What sadist invented this examination? - Me. - Sorry. - [Tom] Want a beer? - Oh, I'd love one. - Come on, then. - Oh, I thought you had it here. I didn't mean we should- - Beryl, do you have a dinner date? - No. - Do you have a husband, or a lover at home? - No, I don't. - Well, then let's have a beer, old girl. - Right. Well, they're all gone now, except for Pegs. - Are you sad? - A bit. But it's probably time. - Well, that's good. Because you just passed your commercial pilot's license with an A grading. - Oh, Kibii. Look. It's a whole new life. Engine, aeroplane. - Aeroplane? - You're going to learn to be a mechanic. - A mechanic? [grand orchestral music] - Gentlemen. Mrs. Markham has located a big herd of elephants, with some magnificent tuskers, two miles East. So we have saved ourselves a day's march. - You really can cook, can't you? - It's a matter of self defense. I've always had to eat what I prepared. - Oh, Tom. You've been so kind to me these last few weeks. I just wanted to say how much I... Come on. You're a good friend. - We've known each other a long time, Beryl. - Yes, we have. - Do you think we could ever be more than friends? - Well. Let's see how good a cook you are first. - Let's forget the cooking, shall we? - You never asked me about Denys. Why? - Because it has nothing to do with me, with us. - I did love him, you know. - Yes, I know. - [Beryl] Now I love you. - Yes, I know. Isn't that enough? - Yes, quite enough. [engine sputters and eventually starts] - 70 feet, right at the door. - Terrific. - Well done! - I'll just go and clean up? - You're a lucky woman. - I know. - Well, don't let him slip through your fingers. - It's different this time. He was my best friend first. - I always thought I was your best friend. - [Beryl] Second best. Tom was the only man in my life who never wanted me to be somebody I wasn't, Tom and my father. - The only ones you really loved? - Oh, Arthur. Why do you always want to reduce my life to scandal sheet headlines? - [Arthur] I'm sorry. - I've loved many people and many things. - Beryl. Why didn't you marry Tom? - Hello, you two. Is there room for a third in the lovebirds nest? - How are you, Bror? - I suppose so, Bror. - Well, I need a flight to London, payment by courtesy of the London Bombay Bank, departure Monday. Do I hear any offers? - Sorry, old man. I'm going to be in Johannesburg all week. - So at least I wouldn't be breaking up the family home if I persuaded Beryl. - I'd love it. Tom? - You're a commercial pilot now, old girl. Bror's obviously in a hurry. Just charge him the usual. - Done? - Done. - Done. - Do you have your alternative compass? - Yes. - Have you checked the spares? - Twice. - Now, you haven't forgotten the wind chart? - Tom, you're the one who taught me everything, but I'm the one who learned it. - Quite right. - So? - So hurry home, old girl. - Keep loving me. - I will. - Good. Morning, Bror! - Morning. - [Tom] You going to survive for five days in that? - Decorum. I thought Beryl would appreciate a man with a sense of decorum. Did my bags arrive? - [Beryl] All loaded. - Excellent. What time is takeoff? - [Beryl] Right now. - Oh, let's go then. [chicken clucking] - [Tom] I've been meaning to give you this. - Oh, Tom. - Take care. - You too. - [Bror] Come on, you two. - See you, mate. [uplifting music] [plane engine rumbling] How are you? - Fine, I'm fine. - Did I earn my fee? - Let's find out if they speak English here first. [laughing] - Well. - Good. How long are you staying in London? - Only a couple of days. I'm going to see Gervase. - Huh? - My son. - [Bror] My dear friend, is that wise? - It's not a question of wisdom, Bror. He's my son. Now let's see if they'll let people like you in the country. - [Mansfield] Hello, Beryl. - Hello. - [Mansfield] You look well. - Thank you. How's Gervase? - He's a very healthy boy. - Good. I'm only here for a couple of days. - Tomorrow afternoon at four, then. - Good. That would be fine. - Afraid I shan't be able to see you there myself. - No, well that's all right. Mother's away for the day too. - I see. But Nurse Graham is the day nurse. She'll introduce you. - Good, thank you. - Keeping well for yourself then? - Yes. I flew here in four days. - Four days? - It was a wonderful journey. - Well, I hope the return is as pleasant. For tomorrow then. - Yes. - Bye, Beryl. - Bye, Mansfield. [doorbell rings] - Good afternoon, Madam. - Hello, Jefferson. How are you? - Very well, thank you, Madam. Nurse Graham is expecting you. The nursery is now on the first floor, Madam. - Thank you. [bell ringing] Well, hello. - Hello. - Well, what a nice bicycle. - It's not a bicycle. It's a tricycle. It's got three wheels. - Oh. So it has. When I'm five, I can take it on my walks. - Do you like to go for a walk? - No, it's boring. - I'm so sorry, Madam. I didn't hear the doorbell. Look at you? where is your jacket? Go and put it on, we've got visitors. - Oh no, that's all right. He doesn't have to- - Go on. I want you in your jacket for tea. And a clean pair of shoes. Gervase? What have we forgotten? What a scamp, but a nice little boy underneath. - [Beryl] Are these his? - Oh dear. I should have thrown those out this morning. He loves drawing. He'll tell you what it's supposed to be, but I'm proved if I can see anything. Just scribbling, I say. I had to confiscate the crayons this morning. He was getting through sheets of paper, as if money meant nothing. That's better. Now come and sit down for your tea. Your shoelaces are undone. - It's not fair. I tried once. - I'll do them. - [Nurse] He has to learn. - Just this once. There we are. - [Nurse] What do you say? - Thank you very much. - Why, you're welcome very much. I like your pictures. What's this one? - It's James Templeton, and me. That his dog, Flossie. She's rather smelly. - And what's that one? - It's Flossie too, doing her doggie poo in the park. - [Nurse] That's enough, child. - Oh, thank you. - [Nurse] I'll get some hot water. - Are you Nanny's sister from Scotland? - No. - Just a friend? - Well not, not exactly. - [Gervase] Her friends don't usually talk to me. - No? [tense music] Didn't Daddy tell you who I am? - No, but you're very pretty. [tense music continues] - Can I have this picture? - [Gervase] Yes. - Um. I'm sorry, Gervase. I can't stay. [somber music] - Is anything wrong, Madam? - I'm sorry. [uplifting music] [calm music] - My darling. Welcome home. How was England? How was your little boy? - Oh he's wonderful, very strong. Oh Tom, it's good to be back. [laughing] Oh, Tom. I missed you so much. - I feel like a criminal. - [Beryl] Why is that? - Hiding things from you. - [Beryl] What are you hiding? - I should have told you right away. Then I didn't, then I couldn't. - What is it? - I've been offered a job I can't refuse, in England. - England? - Lord Furness wants a pilot full time. He's offered me the Earth. Darling. I am deeply, truly sorry. - Don't go, Tom. Please. - I've already accepted, old girl. Well, I had to. I'd be broke otherwise. It's only until I'm on my feet, financially. It won't be for long. It probably won't last. These jobs seldom do. - When will you leave? - Tomorrow. - And tomorrow and tomorrow. - I'm sorry. - You're awake. - Yeah. - You've been watching me. - How did you know? - I sensed it. - Show off. - You will write to me? - Yes. - Your best friend. - Oh, my very best friend. - I expect I'll be back before you even know I've gone. - Tom. I love you very much. - Bye, old girl. [somber music] - Too many goodbyes. There's a lie in every lover's parting. I promise to write. I really don't mind. Of course, you must go. - Poor Beryl. - [Beryl] Yes. Poor Beryl. I really felt sorry for myself. - Tell me something. Would the best dinner in Nairobi help? - It would now. It wouldn't have then. Why am I telling you all this? All you really want to know is, did I write "West with the Night" on my own, or did somebody help? - We'll get back to that. - Well, don't you see? I am telling you the answer now. I'm telling you my life. - Nothing but bills. You know, Mensa. I think we need a cow. - Why? - The milk we get is always sour. You wouldn't notice because you don't care about food. - Kibii, haven't we got enough troubles without having to have a cow? - Bad milk is bad for you. - Sometimes you are just like an old woman, Kibii. - I'll buy one myself, and keep it in the back field. - No you won't. Don't you dare. Why are you doing this to me? I've written every day this week, and not a word from you in return. I reread the letters you wrote when you first left, three long months ago. Lately they're my only contact with you. Oh Tom, darling Tom. I see you every time I close my eyes. But your smile has begun to fade. Bring it back quickly, soon, my only love. [somber music] - Hello? Ah-ah. I have come to kidnap you, for lunch at the club. I've seen your flight record at the airfield. And you have been doing over 80 hours a week, and it. It's ridiculous, and it's dangerous. So I have formed a committee to stop you from working, for at least two days. And I voted to start with lunch at the club. - [Jack] Did you see the latest news? - [Florence] Why, no. - Air ace, Tom Campbell Black, formerly of Nairobi, was married to the English stage star, Florence Desmond at a society wedding in London yesterday. - Didn't he have a little fling with our Beryl? - Didn't everyone? - Quite enough, Jack. Beryl. Beryl, good to see you again. - [Karen] Beryl, where have you been hiding yourself all these weeks? - Immersed in work, I'm afraid. - Beryl, do you see? Tom Black married rather well. [dramatic music] - Oh, Bror. Didn't I tell you? He wrote to me about it last week. - You really are a bastard, Jack. - No, I'm just warming to me task. - [Bror] Maybe this wasn't a good idea. - Oh, Bror. I think I need a drink. - No, you mustn't, Jack. - Stop your whining, woman. - Now. Beryl. I've decided to give you a race, just to prove that no woman can outfly a man. My dear Lord Carberry, the only thing that would prove is one plane's faster than another. And you would obviously win, since you have the faster plane. [all laughing] - All right. I'll give you a real challenge. - Beryl doesn't need a challenge. - [Beryl] Yes I do. - Excellent. - What is it? - The Atlantic. - [Florence] Oh, come on, Jack. - [Jack] It's never been flown by man or woman, East to West, against the prevailing wind. From London to the continent of America, non stop. - It's never been flown for obvious reasons. The fuel load alone would make it impossible. - That's not a challenge, it's a suicide attempt. It's far too dangerous. What are you trying to prove, Jack? - All right, today I shall write to another candidate. I'm sure he'll accept if Beryl declines. - [Bror] Who is this idiot, anyway? - Someone who holds many flying records. He's a man who's in the news. So there's your challenge, Beryl. What's your answer? - Would you provide all the expenses, the airplane and everything? - [Jack] Of course. - Then I accept. - [Bror] Beryl. - If it's possible, I will do it. - You're not serious? - [Bror] We shan't let you go. - I don't know. I fancy myself a headline or two. - In the obituary column? - No. I'll need technicians. - You'll want for nothing, Beryl. I'll give you everything you need. Well except, luck. That you'll have to provide yourself. - Don't worry, Bror. Africa will never leave me. But now I'm ready to leave Africa. - Well, I suppose I should wish you luck. - That would be nice, father. - You won't get Tom back by doing this, you know. - Father, please. - Look, it's not too late to call it off, and stay. I could do with the company. - I'm sorry. - Yes, you were always good at saying your sorry. - Do you have everything you need? - A man needs only water, and a strong will. - You're a good mechanic now. You'll never want for a job. - When I left once to become a man, you were sad. - [Beryl] Yes, I was sad - Now it is you who go out to prove yourself a woman, and I who am left behind. - Goodbye, Kibii. - Goodbye, friend of my childhood. - [Reporter] Beryl Markham's fight over the Atlantic, which has stimulated so much interest and excitement, is likely to be delayed for the third day running by adverse weather conditions. Reports from London authority, today answered- - [Mechanic] Hello, Tom. - Hello. - [Mechanic] Hello, Tom. [inspirational music] - [Beryl] Tom. - [Tom] I just stopped by to- - Oh, Tom. - Wish you all the best. I understand you've fitted extra fuel tanks. - Yes, we have. - Engine bedded down all right? - 110 hours. - Jolly good. Must be rather trying, all this waiting for the weather. - Yes. Come on, grab a cup of coffee. I did try to call you. - Guess the papers were full of you, weren't they? - I thought perhaps we could get together. - Florence was quite jealous. She wanted to meet you, but she had a touch of laryngitis, so. [tense music] The Met Office seems to think this will last till the weekend. - I know. - Yes. [tense music continues] She's a beautiful bird. - Yes, she is. - Well, I really just dropped by to wish you good luck, and I hope you get away soon. So, good luck. [music fades to calm music] - Thank you. [calm music continues] [thunder rolling and rain falling] Damn it, I'm going. Top up the fuel. - What? - [Beryl] I can't wait any longer. Let's get on with it, come on. [cameras clicking] Contact. - Contact. [plane engine rumbling] - The first hindrance was the weight of the fuel load. What a fool I would be, if I couldn't even get off the ground. [plane engine rumbling] [humming and vocalizing] Cabin heat is working. Why am I getting condensation? [plane engine rumbling] The next problem was the fuel gauge. Must be the indicator. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Coffee. That's what I need, coffee. Lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out. Out brief candle, ow! Oh, damn. [plane engine rumbling] [thunder rolling and wind blowing] The flaps had frozen solid. The only thing standing between me and Lord Carberry's happiness was my prayer that the ice might melt at a lower altitude. [engine whining in hard dive] [engine roars back to normal] Prayers are answered, they are. But now I was utterly lost. The storm had thrown me completely off course. All I knew was that I was still heading West, with less than four hours of fuel remaining, if I was lucky. [plane engine rumbling] We must be there, we must. [engine sputtering] Don't back up on me, now. [engine continues sputtering] [engine stops running] [wind blowing] [sheep bleating] - Hey, are you hurt? Are you hurt? - [Beryl] I'm fine, thank you. - What the hell happened? - What is this place? Where are we? - Cape Breton, Newfoundland. Where in the hell did you think it was? - Well, I've just come from London, England. - Yeah well, you just wait there. I'll go get a doctor. Just wait there. - No I have. I've flown the Atlantic. - But that's just not possible, lady. - Yes it is. I've just done it. - [Reporter] On September five, 1936, Beryl Markham became the first woman to fly the Atlantic East to West in a flight lasting 21 hours. The world has been paying tribute to her remarkable fete. And today it's the turn of New York City, and of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. - [Fiorello] May I, on behalf of the City of New York- - [Beryl] I was such a fool. All I could think of saying to Mayor La Guardia was, thank you, oh thank you. [chuckles] - Did you really have nothing to eat? - No, nothing. Only the two brandies, as I said in the interview. - Two, I'm afraid. I wouldn't be such a goody-goody now. - [Arthur] It was a great moment. - Yes, it was. But like all great moments, they never last. What is it the Greek said? The gods only raised you up, to dash you down. [laughing] - All right, boys. Take your pictures now. - [Beryl] Two weeks later, I was still the toast of New York. - One question at a time, boys, please. - Excuse me, one moment. [phone ringing] Hello, hello? I can't hear you. What? Please, please don't. Get out. Get out! - All right, boys. I'll talk to you all later. And I promise you another opportunity. [somber music] Beryl, what is it? - Tom. He's dead. It was a freak accident. He was waiting to take off, and another plane came and landed right on... [crying] It was the most paralyzing moment of my life. - How did you deal with it? - I just carried on, as we all have to, as Tom would have wanted. I was offered a contract to take the aircraft on tour. It was repaired by then. - Beryl. - Jack. - I just wanted to congratulate you. - Why thank you, Jack. It's all thanks to you. - It was a splendid achievement. You're quite a heroine. - Jack. I've had an offer, money, stacks of it if I can take the plane on tour. - I'm sorry, I can't let you. - What? - I can't let you keep the plane. - But Jack, it's the only way I have of making any money. - No, Beryl. The plane's mine. And I want it. Our bargain extended to your landing it here, that's all. - Please, Jack. I beg of you. - You beg me? That's not you, Beryl, surely. Oh, you'll be all right, Beryl. Why, aren't you the international heroine? - By taking the plane away, Carberry had cut off all my immediate prospects. - You must have had a lot of other offers. - Oh, yes. Most of them were silly. And I didn't have the heart for them. I was so lonely. - Is that when you started writing? - Yes, a little. I was invited to Hollywood, to be a technical advisor on a film set in Kenya. World War II had just broken out, but this was very different from my life there. - [Director] Ronnie, you leap from that palm as the chief is about to cook the chimp. Chief, you say, chimp good to eat. - Chimp good to eat. - [Director] You say, chimp my friend. - Chimp my friend. - [Director] Then you grab the chimp, and you do your [mimics yelling] [Tarzan type yelling] Break for lunch. - 30 minutes, everybody. - Excuse me, sir. But the chimpanzee is not indigenous to Kenya. We don't have chimps in Kenya. - Well, we'll just have to rely on the ignorance of our audience. After all, they've never failed us before. Great scene. - Swell. - You wrote this stuff? - Hell, no. I only refined it. My job is to make the garbage smell sweeter, not to create the garbage. I'm responsible for bringing grammar and syntax to the Lord of the Jungle, and various and sundry villains. Excuse me, my name is Raoul Schumacher. And this is Otto's Schmetterling. Otto's slumming today, come down and make sure nobody adds anything tasteful to the picture. You see Otto is an executive of the studio, and should be treated with something between disdain and contempt. Did you know champagne works wonders for a woman, especially when consumed by a man. Cheers. [drunken singing] - [Beryl] Raoul banished loneliness from my life. He brought in laughter, and much too much booze. [drunken singing continues] - Love me, Beryl. Love me like I really deserved it. - You hate it. I know I can't write romantically, and my spelling is absolutely awful. - Are you through? - Yes. - The first thing you should learn, is never to trust another writers opinion, ever. Other writers have an axe, or a pen, or a typewriter to grind. - I should never have shown it to you. I'm not a writer. - Oh, shut up. Now listen. First things first. The title, "West with the Night" is terrific. - But? - Beryl, the second thing is the book is very very good. It's vivid, it's moving, deeply felt, and very nearly a terrific book. - [Beryl] You liked it? - [Raoul] I loved it. - Oh. Oh, Raoul. I don't care if nobody else in the world ever reads it. - Now that would be pretty stupid. Moliere said when you start out writing, you write for yourself, then for a few friends, and finally for money. But I'm gonna help you lick this into shape, and jump you straight to the money. - [Beryl] You'll do that for me? - You'll have to work with me. We'll shape it, sharpen up some of the phrasing. It'll still be you're a book, of course, your life. Then with a little luck, I think we've got a best seller. - Oh, Raoul. You are wonderful. - By the way, you were right about two things. You can't spell, and your grammar is atrocious. - So, how much did Raoul write? - Raoul never visited Africa in his life. - You published some stories after the book, and it was almost as if they were written by somebody else. - Well, Raoul wrote them, using my name. We did collaborate on some, but that was mostly horid. Why is everyone so surprised that I only wrote one book? I only had one life to write about. [voices overlapping] - Just listen to this. A superb evocation, both of Africa, and a gilded childhood which ends in Mrs. Markham's triumphant transatlantic flight. Here is another. The glittering success of her life is now further adorned by a supremely well written account. - Darling, enough. - Enough for you, maybe. But I could use all the praise I can get. - Excuse me, Beryl. I'd like you to meet Armando Giannetti. He's interested in the Italian rights. - Yeah, right to rewrite. But mainly rewrite. It wasn't even published without a rewrite, you know. Look. Look at this, Junior. You want proof? Check the dedication. My assistant, and don't you forget it. Hey, I'll sign your book, honey. I wrote it. The Raoul Schumacher rescue service, at your service. ♪ R-E-S-C-U-E need a little rewrite ♪ ♪ I'm the man to see ♪ I'm the rescue service ♪ It don't matter you can't spell ♪ ♪ Nobody will know 'cause I won't tell ♪ ♪ I'm your rescue service - Raoul, come down. - Down, down to your level? No can do. ♪ I'll rewrite your crummy book ♪ ♪ Don't you worry I'll get you off the hook ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm your rescue service ♪ ♪ R-E-S-C-U-E need a rewrite come see me ♪ - The problems of surviving, and surviving with Raoul, stopped me from thinking about the war. They've canceled our credit at Jurgenson's. [Raoul grunts] They've canceled our credit at Jurgenson's. - It's okay. Our royalty check has just arrived. Money makes the world go round. Why should it stop at Jurgenson's? - Oh. We'll be lucky if that gets us through next week. - Cast worry aside, my darling. I'll have you know at this very moment, I'm in the process of creating our fortune. I have a new game, a fad to conquer America with. It is called the catapult. I wonder if anybody ever bothered to take out a patent on the catapult. Beryl, don't you ever sneer when you walk away from me. It's most unpleasant to laugh at a drunk. - It's more unpleasant to live with one. [mumbling and humming] [knocking on door] - Is Mrs. Markham here? [grunts] Does Mrs. Markham live here? Look, I could come back at another time if it's- - Hey, it's okay, it's okay. You're not from the studio, are you? - No. - They're getting younger by the hour, you know. Have we had the pleasure of meeting before? - No, sir. - [Raoul] I didn't think so. But you know Beryl, do you? - Yes. - Well, come on in. Say, you don't by chance play ping-pong, do ya? I need a little exercise. Beryl! You ever seen one of these? Beryl! - Yes. - [Raoul] A mysterious stranger for you. - Who is it? - Beryl? - Do I know you? - Well. Can my my new but good friend be an impostor? He said you knew him. - I said I knew Beryl. - I'm sorry. - Mystery, everyone loves a mystery. Would the stranger be so kind as to reveal himself? - I am Gervase, your son. [laughing] Do you ever think of going back? To Africa, I mean. - All the time. - When I was at school, I used to collect the newspaper articles about you. Like your horses. - Did you like school? - It was better than home. - Sorry. - When you flew the Atlantic, I was quite the hero. He's very amusing. - Isn't he? Gervase. I really wish things had been different. - Yes. - I am sorry, I really am. Is Mansfield- - It was very good of him to give me this trip. Canada, California. Australia next. - Must you go? Couldn't you stay a few days, a few weeks? - I'm sorry. - Yes, of course. - Delicious dinner. - I really did love your father. He quite swept me off my feet. - He hardly ever spoke of you. But he was pleased when you crossed the Atlantic, broke the record. - Was he? - Yes, I think he was proud. Well. I'd better be going to bed. - I'll give you breakfast. - No, honestly there's really no need. - Please, at least that. - Will you say goodbye to Raoul for me? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - So, off to Sydney? - Perth. Well. Goodbye. - Gervase, there is something I'd like you to have. I'm afraid it's the only inheritance I'll ever be able to offer you. It belonged to my mother. - Really, I couldn't possibly. - [Beryl] Please. It's something to remember me by. - Goodbye, mother. [calm music] - Garbage, illiterate garbage. I'm the writer, me. You want to show me up, is that it? - Raoul, you've got to stop this. - Ah, shut up, you phony. - I can't live this way anymore. - I wrote the fricking book. Why don't you tell the world that? I made it work. Leave my trade to me, bitch! [punch lands] I'm the writer. [glass breaking] [punch lands] [horn honking repeatedly] - [Beryl] He's all yours, sweetie. Raoul married again, a woman who drank as much as he did. It killed him in the end. - And then you went back to Kenya? - No, that was later, much later. - After the war? - Long after. Things had changed. The Africans were angry. They wanted their independence. I only wanted to come back to the place I belonged. - Good morning. - I'm sorry, Madam. You can't come through here unless you have a pass. - You must be new here. - I have been here 10 years. - Well, ask Sir Michael Keane. I'm sure he'll vouch for me. - [Guard] Sir Michael who? - Call Billy Kenneth. I'd like to have a word with him. - Who will I say? - Beryl Markham. - [Guard] Martin? - Markham. - [Guard] Mr. Kenneth. There's a Beryl Markham to see you, sir. Yes. Yes, sir. Madam? Mr. Kenneth says he is very busy right now. He said he might be able to see you tomorrow, after the morning rites. - Thank you. - Mrs. Markham. Nice to see you. - Well, you too, Rocky. How are you? - Fine. - Where is everyone? - They don't come back so much these days, Mensa. Let me get you a little vodka, okay? - Nice of you to remember. Johann. It's Beryl. - [Johann] Good Lord. I didn't know you were back. - Yes. I'm thinking of starting up a training stable again. I hoped that perhaps you might talk to the committee, and ask them to tell some of the owners that I'm back. - Well, the committee can't recommend trainers, Beryl. You know that. - No, I didn't mean recommend. I meant simply to tell them. I must have a few friends left. Michael? - Oh, hello there, Beryl. How are you? - Broke, anxious to get to work. - Oh, I sold my stable some years ago. Except for a couple of little hunters. What have you got in training? - Nothing yet. - Well, it's nice to see you, and good luck. - Thank you. - Welcome home. - [Beryl] I went back to the Delamere's house. His grandson lived there now. - Can I help you? - Oh, hello. My name is Beryl Markham. - Mrs. Markham. I'm sorry. It's been a long time. - Well, yes it has. Very long time, you were only a tiny little baby. It's so strange to be here. It was like a second home when your grandfather was alive. - [Grandson] Come in, and have a drink. - No, No. Thank you very much. I've only come to ask you for something. A long time ago your grandfather helped me. Now I've come to ask for your help. I'm starting a training stud, and I need horses. - I thought you were a pilot. - Yes, yes I was. But before that, I trained horses, for your grandfather in fact. - It's so competitive nowadays. - Yes. It is. - We have contracts now, Mrs. Markham. I'm awfully sorry, but I don't expect I could just break them. - No, I don't expect you could. - Have you tried Roshan Patel? The Asians are becoming people out here now, very serious about it. They've studied the history. I expect Patel will know about your earlier work. - Thank you. - Awfully good of you to come. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful, I mean for old times sake. - Your grandfather was a great man. He came here to build a country, and died with his dream. Not all of us are so lucky. [marching band music] The Africans dream of freedom did come alive, though. I was glad to be a part of it. [marching band music continues] [crowd chanting] What's this chestnut for? - City Breeze, out of Vannaburna. - Very nicely put together. - Well, he has cost me more than everything else combined. He has been a most grievous disappointment. My present trainer says he can do nothing with him. - Really? I'd like to try my hand with him. - To train him? - Yes. - But he's surely unworthy of the famous Mrs. Beryl Markham. - Mr. Patel, anything with four legs looks awfully good to me these days. And City Breeze has excellent bloodline. Oh, he's really coming on. He was wonderful today, really. - And Mensa, we have a new client, Mrs. Reina. - Well, hello. How do you do, Mrs. Reina? - How do you do, Mrs. Markham? - What can I do for you? - I'm worried about my horse. - Well, what's your horse called? - Bold Fantasy. - Well, let's see here what her problem is. Hello, girl. - What's that filly, there? - Bold Fantasy. Old Mrs. Reina brought her the other day. She's got a great heart, great heart, but a week tendon. - What, Mrs. Reina? - No, father, the horse. But did you see City Breeze this morning? Hello. I've really got him flying. We won, Father. City Breeze by half a length. Not the most important race in the world, but a win all the same. I want to have a drink. Would you like a cup of tea? Father? [somber music] - Beryl. I loved you best, best. [somber music continues] - Hello, Mr. Patel. He's magnificent, isn't he? I want to rest him the week before the Derby, and then just a few good gallops, and he'll be absolutely ready. - Mrs. Markham, I'm most sorry about this, because you've worked brilliantly with him. But I've come to tell you that I'm withdrawing him. - From the Derby? - No. I wish to return to my previous trainers. My associates have persuaded me that, despite my deep admiration for your work, that you have been out of the sport for a long time. And we feel that Mr. Ennis' experience will give City Breeze the final polish. I am most sorry about this. I do hope you understand. I have brought you a little bonus in recognition. - This is a bad mistake, sir. - Let Mr. Ennis have the current feeding program, when the truck arrives, will you? - Feels like 30 pieces of silver. - What the jungle does not reveal at night, is still there when light comes. - I'm going to show him. I'm going to show all of them. I'll enter Bold Fantasy. - The filly, with weak tendons, against that stallion? Are you crazy? - Perhaps I am. [voices overlapping] - [Announcer] Now the start, as ordered. There's the only filly in the race, Bold Fantasy, with the black and gold colors, trained by Beryl Markham. And there's our favorite, City Breeze, in the origin red of Roshan Patel. And they're off. Bold Fantasy goes quickly to the lead. The surprise is, she was a late entry, and there's a question mark about her legs. But she appears to be going well today, and is making the running, as the field hits out of the country, around the bend at the top of the course. And as they come down the back straight, it's still Bold Fantasy, who has led all the way, now challenged by the favorite, City Breeze, on her outside. They've quickened the pace, and are drawing away from the field. As they come down the turn, they're neck and neck, with Bold Fantasy just holding off City Breeze. And she's run out. She's run out, nearly out seating her jockey. And that looks like the end of it for the filly. City Breeze is taking up the lead from Bordello. And these two are moving away from the field. And as they come into the straight, it looks to be between these two. But wait. Bold Fantasy has come again. She is making a tremendous lap, as it going up before Downy. She's challenging City Breeze. They're neck and neck. She's going ahead. It's look as though she's going to win. She's going to win, she's done it. Bold Fantasy wins over City Breeze, the first filly to win in the history of the race. - [Beryl] Bold Fantasy's courage triumphed over her weak tendons. Yes, I won many many races. But none of them was ever as sweet as that first Derby. And no horse ever heard as great a heart as little Bold Fantasy. When you've written your article, will you send it to me? I'd like to read it. - Are you sure? - Now remember, Arthur. They're your words, but my life. - All right. This isn't for history, this is just for me. - Oh, wait. Wait. [camera clicks] - Goodbye, Beryl. And thank you. I never wrote the piece for the magazine. I'd become too fond of her to trespass on the privacy of her life. I kept promising myself that maybe one day I would. In her declining years, Beryl was practically destitute. Some of her friends in Africa saw to it that she didn't starve. I'd like to claim that I was one of them, but I wasn't. - [Man] Congratulations on your book. - [Man] See you later, Beryl. - Goodbye, goodbye. - Bye bye, Beryl. - [Arthur] "West For The Night" was republished in 1984. - I'll have another little voddie. - [Arthur] For 20 weeks it was on the New York Times list of bestsellers. The success of the book gave her a few dollars to eke out her last year's. As Beryl herself wrote to me, I've managed to do so much, and most of the things I wanted to do. But I haven't managed to escape old age. God, it's boring. - All right, you'll get yours in a minute. All right, I'll give it to you now. Doggie, doggie, come here. [groaning in pain] [dog whining] - She's not good. She's in here. - Kibii. Kibii. I thought I was learning how to live. But all this time, I was learning how to die.
