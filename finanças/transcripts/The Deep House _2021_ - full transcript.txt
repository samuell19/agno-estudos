Wait, so tell me, baby. We're going to check out an old abandoned building that we found. It's an abandoned sanatorium that locals claim is haunted. Literally, only this guy can find places like this. - Wow. - And all these open windows. I can't wait to go inside. - I hope there are no snakes here. - No, don't worry. Watch out, behind you. - Ben, did you find the stairs? - No, Tina. Not yet. - Be careful. - OK. - What happened here? - In the 70s, a nurse poisoned several children before taking her own life. - How many children? - Seven. Sanatorium was closed down just after. Ever since, supposedly, the nurse haunts the hallways and rooms looking for someone to poison. Fuck ghosts, right? What was that? It's just the wind. Let's go that way. Ben, wait for me. It's fucking scary. Ben! Ben? Ben? Ben! I'm kind of freaked out. I'm not really in the mood to... ...play. Boo! - Gotcha. - You're so annoying. I'm sorry, baby. I look awful in the morning. Well, I think you look sexy as hell and it's noon. What was your time? - Uh, what did you say? - What was your time? Oh, I don't know, maybe three minutes. That's it? What do you mean "that's it"? We're going scuba diving, not snorkelling. Nervous? Yeah. Maybe a little. You've got this. And three minutes is actually really good. Especially in a bathtub. Just think of the lake as one big bathtub. Reflex. You're such a dick. You're driving. You can tell it's summer by the fact the hay has been brought in and taken into bales. And there's a wonderful river valley below. Oh, my God. Ben, what the fuck? Stop it. - What does the GPS say? - It says that we're here. I mean, we're lost. Well, it wouldn't exactly be easy to find if it was really such a super-secret spot, would it? Guess that means I gotta go ask someone. So here we are in South West France. A very typical... in my opinion, slightly dying village. And here's a classic World War Two monument. You notice a lot of the names are shared. So there was few families here, which lost a lot of their favourite sons. As I said, it's sort of a dying village because you'll notice a lot of the houses on this main square have for sale signs in them. Doesn't appear to be many people around and... this one's also for sale. You can notice in the architecture of the small window up by the attic which would often be used as a storeroom. They would have often had a joist and a pulley system to bring the bags of grain up and stored in the attic. Fruit. Let me guess, they've never heard of it. Actually they said that... So... - We can't see it? - No, we can't miss it. Not so secret spot, huh? Fuck's sake. Oh, it's really creepy over there. - It's really creepy everywhere. - I know. - 50,000 views on the sanatorium video. - So? I want more. Every dickhead with a GoPro is down there. Well, that's a bit ironic, isn't it? TB Urbex isn't exactly going to break the internet today. So what? I thought the whole point was to get out of the library, stop reading about those things, start living them. You're acting like a little baby. You're just relieved you won't have to dive. Sorry, look, I-I-I know you trained really hard for this. Why don't we just be tourists for the day? Do that boat thing, lay on the beach. - We're going to need wine though. - Oh, thank you for this. Ben, please don't invite him over for a drink. Please. Thank you. New friend? Pierre. He tells me there's nothing but ruins and shit down there. Apparently all the houses were destroyed before the flood, so... Even without all those tourists, Frais Lake was... never really worth our time. If only we could have found out beforehand. Well, this part of the lake's not worth our time. For a relatively small fee, Pierre's offered to take us to an isolated arm of the lake that runs deep into the woods. Apparently it's very difficult to access and according to him a proper secret spot. I thought we agreed to just be tourists for the day. I know. But listen, babe, at the bottom of this part of the lake... - Come on. You're being annoying. - There's a perfectly preserved house. "Forest cantaloupe." Chanteloup. - It means singing wolf. - Cool name. Erm, and what about the house's area? What's it called? Nothing. It's not on any map. The region suffered a series of devastating floods about 50 years ago. Then construction to control the water flow began in, er... 1984. Wikipedia. - Go on, Pierre. - The village was emptied. The valley voluntarily flooded. And that's how Frais Lake came to be. With a pack of tourists like you come to dive there since. Guys. Do I need to, erm, pay for subtitles here? I was saying that we'll have to cover the last couple of miles by foot. We're not gonna go viral by... It's a long way, but I promise it's worth it. Watch where you put your feet, darling. - Why? Do you think there are snakes? - You'll see. So he is the bold one and you're the scared one. Yeah, I can get nervous but I'm working on it. Voilà. Repairs to the HF seem to have worked, so we shouldn't lose sound this time. What is that thing? It's, er, my drone. His name's Tom. Tom. Like a Peeping Tom. Someone who likes to watch. It's gonna follow us everywhere shooting in 4K. Four what? Nice sticker. Cross of Nero. Symbolizes the death Christendom. Those hippies didn't know that when they chose it as their symbol. You didn't want to tell me that beforehand? - What does it mean? - Peace and evil, darling. What did you say? All I heard was like, "Mort blah blah blah." Nothing. Drop it. Just an old family motto. You got 60 minutes of air and you can hold your breath close to three. You've got this. We're going to be in and out. I promise. We'll get back to New York, we'll edit the footage. Once we reach our first million views, we're going straight to the littlest chapel in Vegas. A drive-through wedding. OK. Just below, it's the perfect spot to propose. You swim straight for 50 minutes. You cannot miss it. Follow the stairs down. The stairs? Sound test. Say something, Tina. That guy gave me the creeps. I hear you loud and clear. - Let's go. - He kept staring at me. Watch out, shark. No, I'm serious. On the way back, you drive next to him. Sure. - Unless he's already left with the van. - What? Just kidding. I got the keys. So here we are in the Lac du Frais. Visibility is pretty good. We're reaching the first plateau ten meters down. Ben! Ben! - What? - Look! My fin. It's stuck. Oh, shit. Come on. Help me. Wait here and I'll come pick you up on the way back. Shut up. Let's keep going. Hey, look. Wow, it's a Rover. A Rover P6, even. It's in great condition. Amazing. - You ever see anything like it? - It's fairly common in lakes. It's not sea water, you know. - Made in Britain, baby, just like me. - Yeah and pig's blood pudding. Ah. Touché. Will you put a song on? Jesus. Ben! What? You don't like it? Better? "Follow the stairs down." Wow. There she is. More than 30 meters down. We see before us the gates to the property. I forgot how superstitious people are in these parts. No kidding. - Oh, no! No trespassing I guess. - Yep. Shall we go back up? Nice try, baby. Come on. Let's do it. So weird. All the fish have gone. Maybe the No Trespassing sign was for them. That man Pierre is full of shit. - It's not a house. It's a shed. - No, silly. It's a crypt. Montegnac. Private mausoleum in the garden. - Must've been well off. - What's wrong with the song? Turn it off. No. No, no, no, Don't do that. It's bad luck. You're way too superstitious. God is watching over us. - Stop it. - INRI. Stop! INRI... This place is massive. Lots to discover, I bet. Come on, Tina. It's unbelievable. It's steel. And sealed shut. It's all right. We'll find a way in. Let's split up. It's completely shuttered up. But why shutter a house that's going to get flooded? Let's find out. Upstairs. Same deal. There's no way to pry these windows open from the outside. If you want to try the chimney, you're going down first. No need. Voilà! Shit! The bastard better not have knackered my drone. You're right. Yeah. Top scares get the maximum likes. - I just hope you got that on camera. - Oh, yeah, I got it. Send in the drone. Out of the way. Must be the attic. But they left all the furniture. Raise your glass to our discovery. Look. - I loved these as a kid. - So pretty. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Insane. Hm, my grandma had one just like that. That's so cool. Yeah. Fuck! - What? - Fuck. Oh, my God, that scared the hell out of me. Cool. Creepy dolls always work. Oh. Air? I have 87 percent left. - Eighty four percent for me. - Right. Breathe a little slower. OK? OK. Good. Relax. The house doesn't look too big. It won't take us long. Jesus. Come on. It's pitch black. I can't see a thing. - Ladies first. - Very funny. Send in the drone. Let's see what the sonar says. What did you say? - Nothing. - What? - I heard a voice. - Must have been interference. Like long frequency, a radio or plane or something. Absence of echo means nothing there. No fish, no doll to leap out at you. We can proceed. Oh, that's cool. They look like a bunch of freaks. I'd say they look like your average French family. Shut up! Tina, quick selfie for our followers. Ugh. Does it have to be in front of a dead animal? For our followers. It's just a skull. Are you pitching to hunters now? TB Urbex. Comment, like... Share. I don't like this place. I don't like it either. I love it. This could be the door to a million views. This house was underwater before I was even born. I mean, how is this stuff not all decayed? What kind of kids were those? Weird kids. Tina, check me out. Yee-ha! No, no, no. Stop. Come on. Have a little respect. - Great shot, right? - Sure. - What do you think? - Your followers will love it. Fuck! Tina. - What? - Look. There's someone behind that. What are you talking about? You're freaking me out with your stupid pranks. Shit, the light. Switch that back on. It's not me, I swear. I didn't touch a thing. For fuck sake, Ben. If you're trying to freak me out, I promise you... Tina, honestly, I saw human silhouette. You didn't see it? - Knock it off. You're freaking me out. - OK. Sorry. It was most likely nothing. Just a shadow. You dick. Don't even do that. What's up with Tom? Jesus, Tom. Don't do this shit to me. - Maybe the fish damaged it. - Maybe. I rebooted him. I hope he holds out till the end of the dive. Moving on. Heading downstairs. Hey. It's the front door. - What are those marks? - They look like... scratches. What the hell? Fuck. Like someone was trapped inside the house. What was that? A piano? - Another diver? - I don't know. Do you think it's Pierre messing with us? I haven't got a clue. Tom's detecting movement. It just stopped. Let's take a look-see. What is moving? I don't understand. I see nothing. I don't get it. Is it us that's setting him off? Impossible. Tom has us in his parameters. Must have been a fish. Came down the chimney. And the piano? Most likely it was a string that snapped from the corrosion. You can try explain it away, but there's something very wrong with this place. Ben, the shadow, the scratches on the door, the weird sounds. - Everything's weird underwater. - Ben, admit it! Yeah, it's pretty freaky. But this is an absolute first. There's no such thing as haunted houses. Sure, yeah. There's some weird stuff going on. But just imagine the mad film we're going to bring back. We're not in any kind of danger. But now we're here, honestly... Don't you want to go a bit further? Sure. I mean, there can't be many rooms left to see. With what just happened, I cannot lie, we're starting to freak out. The adrenaline is pumping. And we continue our exploration. So we reach the next room. - Are those what I think they are? - Yeah. Missing people posters. - And it's all kids. - What kind of freaks collect those? Here's the kitchen. Oh, shit. It's down again. - Sure the batteries aren't dead? - They're brand new. Shit! - What the hell was that? - No idea. Holy shit. What the hell is that doing in a kitchen? There's a door behind it. Come on, Teenie. What if it's a secret room? What the fuck are we doing? Come on. Give me a hand. Yeah, I got it. Pull on that side. Pull it up. Promise me this is the last room we explore. I promise. It's too dark. I can't see a thing down here. The water's too murky. It's useless. I'll send the drone. We'll be fine. OK? Come on. Let's go. Look at this. What's with all the video gear? It's film. Super 8. Wait. There was lots of film in the kids' bedroom, too. What kind of stuff were they filming? What the fuck is that? That's it. I'm out. We're going back up. OK. You're right. Let's go. Ben! We'll go, we'll go. Just a few more shots. Just two minutes, no more. Please, Tina. Wait for me here. OK, two shots, and we're out of here, Ben. Two. OK. They must've been chained up down here before it was all flooded. Chained up alive. Why? I guess the answer is under there. A pentagram. That's satanic shit. And the masks, too? They look like torture masks from the Middle Ages. Who are they? And how come they're... intact? I have no idea. You think that's because of the lake water, too? It's impossible. They should be skeletons. What the... - What are you doing? - Stay here. I'll just take a look. Ben, don't leave me alone. Don't worry. I'm here. Do you see anything? Fuck. What? What's wrong? Ben. - Ben! Ben, come back. - OK. Now! What was behind the door? Nothing. Just more cameras. - We're calling the cops. - No. They'll confiscate our memory cards. This is more than a flooded house, Ben. It's a crime scene. Oh, my God! Look! There's a fucking brick wall. How? No. - No. - Stop, Tina. No, no, no, no. - We're trapped! - Stop, Tina! We're never gonna get out! - Maybe we got the wrong room. - Bullshit! - Tina, look at me. Calm down. - No, no, no. - Look! You can see. - You're breathing air way too fast. - How the fuck did that get here? - No idea. Please. Calm down. - Breathe slowly. - OK. Otherwise we won't have time for our stops on the ascent. - OK? - OK. It's gonna be fine. Breathe like me. There's someone there! - Oh, my God, I saw someone. - Where? - There! Right behind you! - There's nothing there. - There, there. - Are you sure? The house. No. The house is haunted, Ben. - Could be. - Then we're never gonna get out. We're never gonna get out. We're gonna drown. - I don't want to die. - We're going to get out, Tina. OK? Let's go back down. Try the windows. OK. Control your breathing. It's going to be just fine. Just take my hand. OK. - What's going on? - Fuck! - It won't fucking break. - Oh, no. Oh, no. - I'll try and open the shutters. - OK, OK. Oh, shit! Oh, Ben! Ben! Ben! The fish! The fish. - What? - The fish, it's back. There must be another way in. - OK. Can you see it? - There, it went into the kitchen. Wait, wait. There it is. You're going back down there? It's our only hope. - Holy shit. - What? - What is it? - Nothing. - You see it? - No! I lost it! Oh, shit! It found an opening but it's too small for us. Why did you put the music back on? - What music? - Turn it off. It's not me. There's a well. Fuck! There's a grate. Jesus, Ben! Turn it off! Ben? Ben? The couple... Ben, the couple disappeared. Ben, talk to me! Ben! Ben, talk to me! Ben! Ben! Help! Tina! Tina, can you hear me? You OK, baby? I called for help and you didn't answer. - I was right behind you. - I was attacked. It was the chains. It was the chains. I was right here looking for the fish. When I turned around, you were upside down. - You're hurt! - Ben, the bodies. - They disappeared. - What? Look! No. - No, it can't be. - They're dead. - No! - They're fucking dead. No! No. What are you doing? Ben, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, it's them. It's the owners of the house. Shit! Swim! Go! Swim. Fuck! Swim! They're fucking alive! They can't be. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Ben. Shut the door. Shut the door! The chimney... The chimney, it's our only chance. Ben. Ben, I can't breathe! Ben, I'm... - I'm suffocating. - Short, shallow breaths, Tina. We are getting out. It's narrow. Take your tank off. - Ben, I'm not going to make it. - Breathe. Breathe like this... Good, Tina. Great. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. This rope up. Our way out is at the top there. I'll send Tom up to give us some light. We can do this, all right? Come on. You good? - Are you with me? - Yes. Almost there, Tina. We'll make it out, I promise. Not far now. Hang in there. Come on. What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? Oh! Take cover! Fuck! Ben. Ben? Ben! Ben, I'm stuck in the chimney. Ben, where are you? Help. Ben? Ben, answer me. Ben, answer me! Talk to me. Talk to me. Ben! Tina? Tina, are you OK? Come on, Tom. Work! Work, you fucker! Oh, shit. Ben, where are you? Talk to me. Ben, talk to me! Tina, where are you? Tina! Tina, I'm locked in the bedroom. I'm upstairs. Damn it! Oh, shit! Shit. Ben! Ben, where are you? Ben? Ben, answer me! Fuck. Pierre, you bastard. You're the Montegnac's son! Come on, Tom. Work! Work, you fucker! Tina, can you hear me? Tina, are you OK? Fuck! Tina! Ben! Ben, where are you? Ben, can you hear me? Ben! Ben! Where are you? Ben! Ben! Ben. Ben, are you here? Ben! Oh, Ben. Ben! Ben, I'm here. I'm here, sweetheart. Are you OK? Oh, my God. are you hurt? Oh, your mask! - It's leaking. What's going on? - I'm better. - I'm better now. - OK. OK. - How much air do you have left? - I don't know. OK, you have 12 percent. - I have eight percent left. - You'll die before me. What? - What are you talking about? - We're out of danger now. Ben! Snap out of it. You're in shock. Ben, we're gonna get out of here. For fuck sake, wake up. Please. Please. I love you, baby. Oh, my God. Something's in my suit. Fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck. Help! Do you see anything? Oh, my God, it's crawling up my ribs! Keep calm, Tina. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, my God. I can feel it up my neck. It's only a snake. What? What? Look at me, Tina. - Open your mouth. - What? Let it in. - What? - Swallow it! Let go of me, Ben! - Did you see that? - It's the house. She knows... - She knows your fears. - What? Soon we'll have nothing to be afraid of. Where are you going? - The cellar. - Not the cellar, Ben, no! We already explored the basement. There's nothing down there. - You'll see. - No. No, Ben! This is the way. The way out? Trust me. Almost there. This is it. Oh, my God. Finally. What? Come in, Tina. There's nothing here. It's a dead end. This is where it all begins, my love. - Where is the way out? - There was never a way out. - We're safe here. - Fuck. - Five percent. - Good, Tina. Breathe like me. We belong to this place now. We've been chosen. Ben! What the fuck is that? Mr Montegnac and his son, Pierre. Pierre? They would kidnap kids from the neighbouring farms and sacrifice them. - The fucker set us up! - It's not a trap, darling. It's a gift. A sacrifice. Sarah. The locals came to avenge their dead children. They killed her in her own bed. What the fuck is that? But Pierre managed to escape. What are you talking about? I don't care. I don't want to die here. Masks of shame. Intended to punish. No! Don't be afraid, Tina. She will guide us. What? What? Join us, Tina. No, no! Join us, Tina. Join us, Tina. Get off me! Ben, get off me! Let me go! - Ben! - We cannot stay here. I'm going to kill you, my love. Don't be afraid. Ben, let me go! I don't want to die here. No! Don't worry. I shall die as well. Ben, this isn't you! Don't fight it, Tina. This is our chance to be part of something. Something much bigger than us. - Tina? - Yes? - Yes, my love. I'm here. - What happened? We're out of time. We need to go now. OK. There's a passageway above us. Maybe it's the way out. - OK. - Count your breath, baby. OK? No! Ben! Oh, no.
