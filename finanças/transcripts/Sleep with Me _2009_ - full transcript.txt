knew I'd come one day even when I was a kid but why here I was looking for someone did you find them I'm not sure yet and you have you loved someone anyone well Richard of course and before him oh well before him I am I chose very badly I think yes I can take a long time to find what I really want yes and I'm says I think I suppose a what for exactly yes something I lost a long time ago Richard and I tell each other everything that is the official view in fact I think he does tell me everything but there are things that I hold back from him Mazarin for example I never told him the whole story about Mazarin and that house in France partly because I could never explain it to him and partly because of shame sophie alone decided to lend me mahzarin for the day so that i could have a go with him as it were I could have said no of course but I didn't I think my will was paralyzed I didn't know anything about sex then I was young for my age in that way I had to take my clothes off he kept his clothes on he didn't want me to touch him it was all him touching me all over with his fingers his tongue his eyelashes even I didn't know what an orgasm was I was so innocent I thought I was having a fit the first half he made me have one after another helpless utterly helpless from that day on he would take turns with us I knew it was wrong and felt terrible shame and yet the shame was part of the thrill of it and that's still not all hello silly it's Richard um can we meet are you so cold I like the cold you know I was so pleased when you're from sometimes when I've been a man for days that's speaking to anyone it starts a few 35-knot treaties there you know I feel like a coast I can say this thanks dude you're not a ghost your real facility I haven't been able to stop thinking
