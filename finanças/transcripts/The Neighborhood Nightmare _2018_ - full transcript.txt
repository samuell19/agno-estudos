Jamie? Thank you, Sir. - Did you see him? - I swear. He waved at me back. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hi. Thanks. - Morning. - Morning, Barrett. You work in the early shift all this week or what? Yeah, I'm actually working a double while they find a replacement for Henry. Aww, poor guy. I suppose you're really gonna need this today. You are my savior. Nothing a lot of caffeine can't fix, right? I'll cheers an amen to that. Okay. - Have a good day. - You too. Obviously, this is our cardio and lifting room. Um, you're gonna alternate training here and the yoga studio. Got it. Oh, and pick up Phil Slack on an as-needed basis. Hey. Good morning, Lindsay. - Morning. - Hey, I'm Brody. - Hi. - Hi. Can I see you for a sec? Yeah, I'll be right there. Thanks. Who's that? Does he work here? Oh, that? That's Brody. And you can flex your pecks in front of him all you want... but he's spoken for. Bloop! Why are the good ones always gay? That's just a big myth, you know. There are plenty of good ones who aren't. What about you? Are you married? Uh, divorced. As of two years ago. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Oh, it's a necessary thing. It was... best for him, me and our daughter. Please don't tell me he left you a parting gift like mine did. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. I probably shouldn't have brought it up here at work on my second day. - Poor form. - It's fine. I'm sorry that happened to you. My ex-husband, um, he wasn't abusive. He was more so on his way to making me wonder if he could be, though. Um, he lost his job the year we split, and he was depressed, drinking all the time. And then came the verbal abuse. He would show up unannounced, drinking and yelling. And then, one night, he broke in and threatened to break a beer bottle off and stab me with it. Oh, wow. I mean, I'd like to think that he never would have been capable of hurting us, but it shook me, and I never wanted to find out. So that's when I quit my job as a banker and opened up this gym and yoga studio. So that if he ever shows up again, you can beat the crap out of him? Maybe. But my ex has never been back since, so... I bet. I feel sorry for the next man who marries and tries to cross you. Well, you don't have anything to worry about there. I never intend on getting married again. Hmm. Never say never. You bringing work home with you this evening? Oh, yeah. Uh, Jamie asked for me to, uh, bring a pair of free weights home, to leave it at the house. Ah, she's trying to get all buff like her mom. I guess. But, uh, you know teenage girls. These things will be covered in dust by the end of the summer. Well, hey, I mean, if she isn't gonna use 'em, I'd be happy to take 'em off your hands. Give me something to do to keep me awake around here. Well, hey, I'm just glad that I live in a neighborhood safe enough where our night watchman can be bored on the job. True. Oh, hey, has Jamie come through yet? Uh, yeah, um, her and Nikki just got dropped off by the punk with the ponytail, you know. There goes the neighborhood. Hiya, new neighbor. - Stephen Lane. - Hi. Lindsay Porter. Oh, hah, your new neighbor. Uh, well, welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. I'm new to the area, I just moved out from downtown and I was wondering where I could find a new gym membership in the burbs myself. You're dressed like you just got back from the gym. Right. Yes. Uh, well, kinda. Uh, 'cause I-I actually run a little private gym down on Glendon. Wasn't that just perfect? I'm in the market for a new gym. And I'm sure you could always use a new client. Yeah, uh, here is my card, at the gym... card. Great. - Thank you, Lindsay Porter. - Hmm. Um, I think you're being monitored. Uh, yeah. That is my daughter Jamie, and her best friend Nikki. So, I suppose I should probably behave. I wouldn't want them to think I was, uh, hitting on you or anything. Um, you know, we actually do live in an extremely nosey neighborhood, so... You know, just be prepared to have your public persona studied under a microscope, like, pretty much 24-7. Ah, so, keep all my dirty little secrets behind closed doors. Noted. Lindsay. Stephen. I see you've met our new resident. Hello, Katherine. How're you doing? - Wait, how do you... Right. - Oh... Yup. She, uh, sold me my house. - Um-hmm. - Exactly. We go way back. Oh. Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'm all sweaty. Oh, no, it's-it's fine. You ladies are just starting to make me feel a little, uh, inadequate and out of shape. Oh, come on. I think you're gonna fit in around here just fine. At least among me and Lindsay here. We're the only singles on the block. We're all close and comfy around here, kinda like a big, happy family. - Right, Linds? - Mm-hm. Yeah, I was, uh, just starting to notice that. Well, I sure hope Lindsay has already invited you to our neighborhood watch meeting on Thursday. No, not yet, she hasn't. Although, she did warn me how nosey all the cozy little residents of Shady Grove are. Well, Lindsay here is our resident neighborhood watch leader. In fact, she started the entire program. So, maybe you can tell him a little more about that. Anyway, I gotta run. See you later. Bye. So, is, uh, everyone around here that... Drop dead gorgeous? Uh, no. Just Kat. I was gonna say aggressive. Well, you know, at least with her, what you see is what you get. So, what does one get with you? Uh, um, I don't know. Baggage? I'm gonna use this. - Okay. - Goodnight, neighbor. Night. Hey, girls. How was school? Well, apparently, it wasn't nearly as eventful as Miss P's after-school special on the front lawn. What? Come on. Guys, that was nothing. He was asking me about the gym. Oh, and you offered him a personal training session over at his new bachelor pad, I hope. Nikki, ew. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Miss C. Hey, Mom. Rita told me she saw you talking to the new neighbor next door. Oh, my God. Nothing gets past Rita B. - So, what's the deal? - He's hot, Mom. Real hot, and he was totally into her. I could tell. Really? This is great. Is he age-appropriate? Late 30s, and he dresses to the nines, and has a nice car, so you know he's not just some deadbeat. So, did you like him? And can you please be quiet for one second? Let her answer for herself. Sure. Yeah, I mean, he's attractive. Um, and, yes, he's age-appropriate, but wewere not flirting. We were just talking about the neighborhood, and, uh, gym memberships. Yeah, plus, who dates a guy who literally just moved in next door? It sounds like a disaster, right? Exactly. A bad idea, how exactly? Because you're afraid to fall in love with someone who conveniently lives just a stone's throw away from where you do, or simply 'cause you're afraid to fall in love? - Mom! - Come on. I gotta get dinner on the table in an hour or else your brother's gonna get home from soccer practice, empty out the entire pantry. Move! - Uh-h-h! - Move, move, move, move. - Bye-bye. - Bye. I just don't feel it's safe for anyone to be coming and going at all hours of the night when we all agreed to a curfew of 10:00 p.m. for children. Rita, not that it's any of your business, but my son works until ten most nights saving up for college. Fine, then he shouldn't blare his music at all hours of the night throughout the neighborhood. Rita, perhaps you should focus less on my son and more on your two thirteen-year-old girls who spend every afternoon smoking weedby your pool until you or Alan return home. My daughters do notsmoke weed. Okay, uh, ladies, I think you both expressed your concerns herein. Uh, and, yes, Rita, we should be mindful of our kids going in and out at all hours, playing loud music and disturbing the peace. But, as you're all aware, Barrett logs all entries and exits after six. So, I think that we can have some exceptions to the curfew, such as where work is involved. Plus, I already spoke to Danny about the music, all right. He's a good kid, already apologized. Just trying to stay awake while driving, 'cause he was tired after work. Uh, do we have anything else? No, that's it. Okay. Uh, all right, we've covered everything, so we're done for tonight. Uh, next time, ahem, uh, we will be covering some more events. Please, bring your questions then. What are you doing here at our little rumor-filled gossip fest? Well, I thought if I wanted to start fitting in sooner than later, what better way than to throw myself right into the nosiest neighbors in the hood. Well, you came to the right place. I'm Janet Chung. I live two houses down, just on the other side of Kat. Ah, well, nice to meet you, neighbor. Nice to meet you. Hey, it was nice to meet you. I've got to get back to relieve my fill-in, but welcome to the neighborhood. - Thanks... - Barrett. Barrett. Barrett, right. Right, right. - I'll see ya. - Oh, hey. Thanks for having my back in there. That's why I'm here for. Hey, would you mind giving me a lift? I-I walked here earlier. I was thinking I could show you the layout of the neighborhood along the way. I mean, I sold at least half the homesaround here. Um, y-yeah. Yeah, I could, I can drop you off. Would either of you like a ride? - Well, a-actually... - Oh. No, I mean, I... I drove us in my car, so... Yeah, we're good. Thank you, though. Um, you guys have a nice evening. All right. Well, goodnight, ladies. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Hello? Hello? Trust is earned. And finding your tree, push your thigh and foot against each other creating resistance. Reach up through the crown of your head and down through your other foot, spreading your toes, and breathe. Uh, you have a visitor here. I saw him walking around the gym floor, and he was for myself. Go on. Thank you. All right. So, what are you doing here? Oh, I thought I'd see if you had a, uh, I don't know, friends and neighbors discount on new memberships. Mm-hmm. Are you here to work out... or are you just here to try to make me as uncomfortable as humanly possible with your pressed juice and your muscly tank top arms? Okay. How... is that? - That better? - Uh-hmm, hmm. Well, uh, I came down to work out and to see if you wanted to join me for dinner tonight. Um... I don't think I should... do that. Um, my daughter's not so keen on me dating right now. That's okay. I'm not asking your daughter out. I'm asking you. And I'm not gonna leave until you say yes. I'm gonna stick around, and believe me when I tell you, you do not wanna see my downward dog. Okay, fine. One dinner... but, like a friendly, neighborly sort of dinner, not a date. I'll take it. Pick you up at seven. Thought you were gonna work out? I told you, I'm free to work out in the afternoon. Member 266. Your boy Phil hooked me up, uh... I think he likes me. Who's that? Uh, my new neighbor. His name is Stephen, and I think he just joined my gym. Is that all he did? And he asked me out to dinner. I'd be careful if I were you. Why would you say that? I don't know, he just... I just saw the way he was looking at you. He reminded me of my ex. There's a lot that man's not sharing. I'll have the filet mignon, rare. And I could be wrong, but I think she might want the same. I would like mine medium, please. Thank you. Thank you. Well, to... - Special occasions. - Special occasions. So... tell me about your daughter. Jamie. She is seventeen. Junior in high school. Straight A's, Type A, no boyfriend to date or none that she's ever told me about. Do you usually talk about that sort of stuff? Well, lately, I'd be lucky to get her to talk about anything. I mean, she works out at the gym with me sometimes, but we don't... eat ice cream and watch movies on Friday nights like we used to. Well, sounds to me like you might need a new movie-watching buddy. Maybe. It's not like I'm lonely all the time. But, I-I just wish things were a little bit different with Jamie. Hmm. May I ask about the father? He is no longer in the picture. So, anyway, tell me more about you. What do you wanna know? Where did you move here from? Rossford. Actually, I missed our little firm down there, and we were moving offices to a new suite Center City soon, so... And, uh, what kind of firm? Adult psychiatry. You're a psychiatrist? Thank you. So, that is, uh, why you stare at me so intensely? I'm sorry? Because you're a psychiatrist, you're, like, trying to figure me out. No, I'm only staring at you because... I think you're super sexy. - Ahem. Drink your wine. - Yeah. And, you know, you were wrong when you said that Kat Riley was the most gorgeous woman in the neighborhood. She really has nothing on you at all. Come on. Look at her. She is super successful, no children, and not one flaw in her entire body. Ah-ha. You see, I like flaws. So, go ahead, continue. Tell me more. No, no, you're not gonna play shrink to me anymore tonight. You're really good at that, though. Always bringing the conversation back to me. Okay, fine. I'll tell you one of my flaws. I literally cannot raise a plant to save my life. Tried a thousand times. I once killed an ivy plant in my office. Literally, the hardest plant to kill. All right, I'm liking it. Got some serious flaws. Hm. Um, I should, um... I should probably get inside. I didn't tell Jamie I was gonna be out so late. Yeah. Of course. You know, I'd really like to meet her sometime. Maybe she should try one of my burgers. It could convince her... I was worthy of dating her mom. I'm pretty mean on the grill. Well, you know, I have been meaning to get a new one. Ours is ancient. There you go. New special occasions on the horizon. We'll see. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hah! Morning. Morning. So, I heard you and our new neighbor went out all fixed up, Friday night. Rita Barnes tell you that? Hm, Barrett spilled the beans. Said you didn't come home until after ten. I didn't realize us adults had curfews as well. It was just a dinner. - No big deal. - Oh, I think it's cute. - Where'd you go? - The Alastair. - Oh, fancy. - Yeah. Well, I guess you already beat me to the punch. But I thought I'd host a little all-inclusive barbeque at my place on Monday night. Just a welcome-to-the-neighborhood hello to our new neighbor. - Can you come? - Sure. What can we bring? What, who? You and Stephen? - Me and Jamie. - Oh. Oh. Um... You know what, I-I thought we would just do a big kids only. You know, just because Janet's youngest she's still in that "let's break stuff" phase, you know? Okay. So it's not quite all-inclusive then, is it? Hm. Bring some wine. Whatever you like. Maybe I could also bring these new grilling skewers I just got. Sounds great. Let's get shish kebab-ed. Well, I'll see you on Monday. Bye. All right. Same time next week? If I don't keel over and die before that, fine. I think you'll be good. - Lunch. - Yay. So... tell me all about your date. I already told you everything when you texted me. Oh. You said that it was very nice, that the food was great, and Stephen's very sweet. But there was no mention if there was a kiss. There was, and it was nice. Okay, fine. It was amazing. Yay! I cannot wait to see you two in action tonight over at Kat's. There will be no action. Besides, I'm not sure Kat is too thrilled with the idea of the two of us, anyway. God's given that girl too many gifts in life already. You deserve yourself an amazing man. Ooh, which, by the way, I think that Jamie's coming over tonight to help Nikki with the kids while we're over at Kat's, and then she's gonna sleepover, so you and Stephen can have a little sleepover, too. Stop. Stop right there. Behave. Fine. I will behave. But I hope you won't. Ooh. Yum. I'll take that. So, Barrett, what was it you were doing before this? I was in the Marines, actually. You never told us that. You never asked. I knew he was. - For how long? - Eight years, actually. Oh, wow. Commendable job. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Yeah, put me through school. No PTSD? Not any that I'm aware of. So, where were you before here? Well, I'm originally from Ohio, but, uh, I've been in LA area about 15 years now. Practicing psychiatry, yeah? Don't look at me. I didn't tell him. You do background checks on new move-ins? Your paperwork when you leased the house... Ah-ha. Hey, at least I didn't tell them your last year's salary. It's a good thing I bought my house before Kat took over the neighborhood, huh? We come bearing nourishment. Oh, wonderful. It looks great. Thank you. That looks fantastic. Thank you. Here we go. Oh. Wa-wait. Uh... Didn't your... ex-husband buy the house? Yeah, well, that was before he lost his job, became a deadbeat dad, and Lindsay had to buy him out. I mean, not all of us had the luxury of starting a real estate business on our rich daddy's dime. Well, my dad always said I was a great investment. Well, thank you all for coming tonight. What a perfect night for grilling. Took the words right out of my mouth. Cheers. It's funny seeing you out of uniform... out of your element. - It's sexy. - Well, thank you. I was actually thinking I should probably head home now, since I have a bit more of a drive than the rest of you. But are you sure you don't wanna... stay? You know, you've never shown any interest in me before. Why now? Well, you've never been off the clock with me. It wouldn't have been appropriate for me to... Are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with your interest in Stephen, and his interest in Lindsay over you? Oh... Stay the night and I'll show you. How about we go on a real date? Fine. I need another drink. Hey, you guys aren't leaving, are you? I-I was just about to open another bottle of champagne. Sorry, tomorrow is my work day, we gotta get home and make sure the kids didn't burn the house down. Hm. Thank you. Goodnight. - Thanks. - Thanks for having us, Kat. - It was really nice of you. - Thanks, Kat. It was great. Well, tell Jamie I said goodnight, and thanks for texting me back. - I will. - Bye. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. All right. You're not a bad chef. - Bye. - Have a good night. - See you guys. - Goodnight. And you guys have a good night. Be safe on these dangerous streets. Oh, we do feel less safe when you have a felon. - Bye. - Goodnight. Goodnight. So... So... I had a really nice time tonight. I did, too. Do you think maybe we could, uh, see each other again this week? - Yeah, I guess. - All right? Ah, good. Stephen, um... what Janet said about my ex-husband, I... I'm sorry that came up. Hey, look. Don't worry about it. While I can't pretend to know what that was like for you, I, uh... I do know how tough relationships can be. You know, my engagement was... well, sort of a nightmare. But what matters most is that we're over them now, right? Right. Well, um... just wanted you to know it's not, you know, something we normally talk about at dinner parties. Let alone on a second date, huh? Oh, I'm sorry, that wasn't a second date. No, no, it was just, um, you know, neighborly picnic. - Ah. Is that right? - Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm not entirely convinced that you'd let just any neighbor... do this. I guess they found the key hidden there under the pot. You might try finding a less obvious place for a spare key, yeah? - Yeah. - Mom, are-are you okay? Yeah, honey, I'm fine. Is there someone that you can think of that might not like this Mr. Stephen Lane giving you a dozen roses? Sleeping over? Um... - I'm sorry, I didn't realize. - No, it's okay, Detective. Um, you... I-I can't really think of anyone who would have a problem with my relationship with Stephen. And yet, it seems to be a growing trend around here. And, y-you are... Oh, sorry. Uh, this is my best friend Janet Chung. She lives three houses down. And who do you think has a problem with Miss Porter's relationship with the next-door neighbor? Katherine Riley. She lives right there between me and Stephen, just on the other side. She has a thing for Stephen. I don't think she would've done something like this. I mean, she's, she's our friend, and, yes, she's a little bit outspoken sometimes, but she's not, like, uh, an intruder and a vandal, right? And what do you think, Mrs. Chung? I agree, I guess. Passive aggressive isn't really her style. Okay. Well, we'll talk to her. Make it seem like we're questioning all the neighbors, that sort of thing. And what about, uh... What about your daughter? She didn't seem too enthused with your little rendezvous yesterday evening. No. Jamie? No. No, no. She's a very well-behaved kid, believe me. Plus, she was sleeping over at my house all last night. Could she maybe have, I don't know, snuck out? Made a fast visit home? Kids do these sort of things. Especially in split-parent homes. A-and tell me, Detective, exactly where would she have gotten an entire bouquet of black roses? Because we're not growing any in our backyards. Ma'am, we're just covering all possible scenarios. That's our job. And where did you say Jamie's father is now, Mister... Jamison Porter. He's Downtown, right? Yeah, we're divorced. Um... He lost his temper one night after the split and, and things got a little out of control. But he, he wouldn't do anything like this. I mean, he hasn't even talked to Jamie in a while, and he doesn't know about Stephen, so... You're a 100 percent sure of that? Okay. - Hey. - Hey. I talked to Terrence. He said police questioned him today. - You all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Glad you're back at the gate, though. Well, you got me on voice dial, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Goodnight. Thank you. Goodnight. Hey, you all right? Mom, I really don't wanna talk about what you're about to bring up, okay? Okay. I love you. Yeah, you, too. - Mom, are you okay? - Jamie, get down here. Stephen, someone's in our backyard right now. Please come. Come on, Jamie, let's go! Come on! Let's take this jerk down. No, absolutely not. We are leaving right... - Oh! Jeez! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's just me! - Just me. - How did you get here so fast? I was just out on a walk. Now, w-where'd you say you saw this person again? In the back. You called him instead of Barrett? Nobody back there. I checked the path all the way to the fence line around your gatehouse. It's all clear. Great. So, can I have my rifle back? Jamie. Mom, I have school tomorrow, and I-I have to at least try to get some sleep, okay? If you hear anything else, just scream again. I'm gonna stay on the couch tonight, anyway. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Try to get some sleep. Lindsay, hi. How're you doing? I'm... fine, Kat. Really, I don't think this emergency meeting is necessary, though. I'm sorry. I-I just... Rita and I thought it was necessary. I mean, you had the cops at your house two days ago. I know, we're usually talking about our kid's fundraisers or neighborhood activities, so I can't really think of a more appropriate time than now for a real watch meeting. - Am I right? - Okay. Um, yeah. Then we should just get started, I guess. Uh, good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here tonight. Um, and thank you, Rita and Kat, for calling this emergency meeting. Um... I didn't really think of doing this myself, 'cause I, I wanted to avoid causing a stir. But I guess, uh, that's what these are for, right? So we can openly communicate neighborhood concerns. And... with that, anyone wanna share where this came from? What is that? Oh, it's a spare key, to my house. Or, you know, at least it was until I changed my locks after someone here used it to break into my house and leave a trail of petals to a bouquet of these at my doorstep. But that's just awful. Who would do something like that? Certainly no one here. I mean, that's kind of an inappropriate accusation to be making here, don't you think? Well, I'd like to think so, Kat. But seeing as how only a select few of us even have keys to the center, I have to wonder. You're not accusing me, are you? Because most of the time, we leave this place unlocked. Mostly because this neighborhood has always been such a safe haven. So now, come to think of it, the only truly dangerous times we've had in this neighborhood were A, when your marriage fell apart, and B, now. Seems to be a trend with you, don't you think? You know what, Kat? If you think that I'm such a liability, and that you're better off leading these watch meetings, fine, by all means. Go ahead. But, just so you know, I'm watching you. Well, no, no, no, wait. Hold on. Couldn't someone have come in during the daytime when the center was open for recreational use? Right. Maybe that's what happened. Good luck figuring out who. Uh, Janet, who's gonna write up the minutes? Why don't you ask nosey-ass Rita B. to handle that for you? Pretty sure she already has a play-by-play from your own little black book. Uh, well, um, Rita, uh, wh-where do we start? Why didn't you call me? Stephen lives right next door. And I was afraid. We'd been texting, so I knew he was awake. Okay. Look. I know you like this guy, Linds. Okay? But you barely know him. All right. I mean, Kat's got a point. I mean, don't you think it's just a little bit coincidental that none of this started happening until this guy moved into the neighborhood? Barrett's right. You still don't know much about Stephen, yet. And it is strange that he hasn't told you much about his personal past. Uh, he was engaged once, and he had a past relationship that was a nightmare. So what if it's someone that doesn't want you getting closer to him? Yeah, well, if that's the case, then maybe you should take a good, long look at your girlfriend. Okay, Kat is not my girlfriend, all right? We're just dating, or talking. I don't know. Look, I, by no means, think that she's an angel. I just don't think that Kat's capable of this kind of behavior. Plus, that doesn't explain the black truck that Terrence saw flying out of the neighborhood the other night. Or the fact that there is just something that this guy isn't telling you. Hey, Stephen. Can we talk for a moment? Outside. Sure. I've got to get back to work. You're gonna be all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, Barrett. Just, uh, give me a call, let me know if you want me to come back, walk you guys home, all right? Mm-hm. Look, I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I wasn't taking sides or anything. I don't wanna be the reason that you're fighting with your friend. No. Kat's barely a friend. Listen, um... Do you know anyone who drives a black truck? Maybe someone from your past? You do know someone, don't you? Yeah. My ex-fiancé used to drive a black truck. Her name is Valerie Hyde. She, uh, she was a patient of mine. - Valerie Hyde? - Yeah. That's funny, 'cause my new personal trainer drives a black truck and her name's Valerie Sims. - Sims? - Yeah. Sims was her first husband's last name. How could I've not seen her there? I-I've gone almost every day after work for a couple of weeks. But she asked to only work mornings. Oh, my God. She's the one doing this. So sorry, I... What happened with you and her? I had to completely cut her out of my life. She started claiming that I was cheating on her with my patients, that I hit her. - Did you? - No! No. I'm sorry. I just... She showed me scars. She said you inflicted on her. She's delusional, Lindsay. I've treated her for, for multiple compulsive behaviors. Lying being just one of many. And those scars are from when we went mountain climbing eight months ago, back when we first started dating. It doesn't-doesn't really matter what she's lying about. What I wanna know is, how did she even know about us? I don't know. I... Maybe she found out where I moved, and found the nearest gym, and figured I joined it. No. I know how she knows about us, because I talked to her about you and I had no idea. That first time you came into the gym, she was there. She, she must have just been hiding in the women's locker room or something, but she saw you. She saw ustogether. I'm, I'm so sorry, Lindsay. Is she scheduled to come in tomorrow? - Yeah. - Okay. I'm gonna go to the gym with you. I'll talk to her. I'll take care of this, okay? - Okay. - I promise. Well, you should stay out here, so we don't cause a scene, I guess. - Yeah. - I'll start... All right. Hey, have you seen Valerie? No. I tried calling, and no answer. But... somebody left this for you. Thanks. This is all starting to make sense now. That first phone call I heard said, "Trust is earned." And then, the gift note said, "Don't get burned." And now this. "Consider it a lesson learned"? I think she's trying to warn me. - About what? - I don't know. About you. Or th-that she doesn't want us to be together. Obviously, she doesn't want us to be together, but she is clearly not in her right mind right now, so don't tell me you're actually entertaining her delusions. Why were you even dating a patient in the first place, Stephen? Listen, Lindsay, believe me, I know what mistakes I made, okay. But as soon as I realized there was an attraction between us, I stopped treating her. Stephen, I defended you when people were concerned that you were hiding things. - And guess what? You were. - Hey, that is not fair. You said it yourself that you didn't wanna talk about past relationships anymore than I did. Yeah, except my ex isn't stalking you and warning you to stay away. Well, so I guess you should, then. Consider it a lesson learned. Are you sure you don't want us to cancel our trip and stick around for you? We could still get a refund. Partial refund. No, Janet. Look, Valerie already knows that we know, so I'm sure she's gotten as far away from here as she possibly can, right? And if not, when she comes back around here, I'll take her down with Barrett's pistol myself. Look... I'm sorry for what happened at the meeting last week. You were going through a tough time and I shouldn't have been so hard on you. Wasn't very neighborly of me, was it? Yeah. Well... I'm sorry for pointing the finger. I, I shouldn't have done that. You and Jamie should come over for dinner tonight. I'm sure groceries are the last thing on your mind this past week. Thank you, Kat, that's very sweet. That's what neighbors do for one another, right? Thanks. You okay, Mom? Yeah, um... I'm fine, the, ahem, torch smoke is just making my eyes water. Okay, um, well, I think I'm gonna go call Nikki and see if they've made it in... yet. Um, do you think we should go home, too? Yeah, sure, um... Just go ahead and I'll, I'll be in, in a few. Okay. - Love you. - You, too. Hey, lady. How you holdin' up? Hey, guys. Are you off tonight? Seems like I'm always on a job with you. Kidding, Kat asked me to come by for a few. To keep the creeps away. Uh, have you talked to Stephen? Um, he and I called it quits, I guess. That's too bad. Probably for the best, though. I mean, I certainly wasn't feeling very good when... he and I were hooking up, and then he just discarded me and started dating you. Wait, what? Oh, come on, like you didn't know. Why else would I have thrown myself at you like that? You knew I had a thing for him. Said it yourself. You were hooking up with Stephen? Yes, um, I-I'm sorry, I didn't say anything earlier. I just... I could see you liked him and I didn't want to get in the way of that. But, hey, seriously, don't let it bug you. It was... when I was selling him the house, so it was at least a month before you met him. You know, you really don't care who you hurt, do you? I think you're into it. What, I'm into hurting people just because I'm honest? Oh, give me a break. You know what? I'm gonna go. You gonna be all right? Yeah. I actually thought you liked me. Oh, come on, Barrett. Don't be so dramatic. Hey, I had fun while it lasted. We can still be friends. Jeez, what's with him? Well, we're gonna take off, too. Oh, of course. Oh, no, no, no. I-I got this. Just go inside. I'll just be a minute, and, and I'll walk you guys home. Thanks. Hello? Kat? Hey! Where are you? I already had to sneak in past one of those idiot night watchmen again. And now, the cops are after me too? You told me we were in this together. So call me back. Oh, thanks. Jamie, get back inside. Oh, God. Oh, my God, is Stephen okay? What the hell's happening in Shady Grove? So who was at the back? Well, it's, uh, Miss Valerie Hyde. Hey, guys, how you holdin' up? How do you think we're holding up? They just carried a body out, for Christ's sake. Hey, hey, hold on. It's not Stephen, okay? But it's not good, Terrence called me this morning, told the pool guy found a body. Do they know who it is? It's Valerie. What... What happened to her? No one knows for sure, all right. They haven't given Terrence any of their answers. They're-they're arresting Stephen? Why? Detective, why are you arresting Stephen? - I don't understand. - We found evidence. It's giving us reason to believe that that Mr. Lane may have been involved with the murder of Miss Hyde. I'm sorry, Miss Porter. Thanks for stickin' around tonight. You didn't have to take off, did you? No, I asked Terrence to cover my shift this evening. Besides, I wanna stick around, make sure you guys are safe. - Thanks, B. - Hey, you got it, kid. I cannot believe you guys are drinking coffee this late. Thought I'll sleep tonight, anyway. It kinda feels like old times all over again, huh? You know, when I was first startin' out, and you were still afraid, having trouble going to sleep at night. Right. God, poor guy. I was calling you, like, all the time to check up on things. Yeah, we drank a lot of coffee back then, and played a lot of late night rookie those first few months of me workin' here. But, hey... you'll get through this too. Just like then. Even if it means three more months of rookie, huh? It's nearly 10 o'clock, who's texting you so late? It's Dad. What? Your father is texting you? What did he say? He, he just said he saw what happened on the news, and, and he was worried, so he just wanted to check in. And that's all. Let me see. Let me see your phone. Mom... Okay, fine. You told him about me and Stephen? He asked me what happened. And he wants to come pick you up? Yes, so what? He... Mom, he's worried about us. Great, now he's concerned? You've been texting since 6 o'clock. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Because I knew you would freak out, like you're freaking out right now. Jamie, your father threatened my life the last time you saw him, you understand that, right? Mom, I know, I was the one that kicked him out, remember? But he's still my dad, and-and he's sober now, and-and he got help. Yeah, and if by help, you mean all these script drugs he's jacked up on all the time. And I know, because some of the medical bills still come here. What if it was him and not Stephen? What if James killed Valerie because of what she was doing to us? Oh, please. Lindsay, I don't think that's possible. Jamie, go upstairs, yeah? Go ahead. Is that really necessary? Have you seen any of what's been going on in your neighborhood the last two weeks? It's Stephen. They let him out already? I don't know. I'm gonna tell him to leave or we're gonna call the cops. Look, I did not kill Valerie, okay? The cops released me, the DA's wife is a client of mine, they know I'm not capable of doing something like this. Okay, Stephen, but who else would want to kill her? Who else would even know she was in your backyard? I don't know any more than you guys do, okay? I was in the shower, I didn't hear anything. But I did not kill Valerie, okay, I mean... If I had really killed her, do you think I would just leave her floating in a pool with a trail of water to my room? I mean, how dumb would I be? You wouldn't have to be dumb. You just have to be insane. Please believe me, Lindsay. You're the only one who knows me well enough to know that I did not do this. I don't know how I feel. I-I just need a little bit of time, okay? Lindsay... I know, and I was upset, and I overreacted when I walked away from you, but... It was only because I was frustrated that you didn't trust me. So, please... Please trust me now. I've never lied to you. I would never lie to you. Not even by hooking up with Kat before coming on to Lindsay, huh? I wish I'd never done that, okay? It was, it was stupid, and I was just emotional from my last breakup, but... I never cared about her. I do care about you. Just go home, Stephen. She's heard all of this before, and you've done enough damage for one night, as it is. - Hello, Miss Porter. - Detective... - It's okay. - Come in. Sit. I, uh, I just wanted to check in, see how things were with you and Jamie. Fine, I guess. I mean, nothing bad has happened since Sunday, so... And Jamie? She back in school now? Yeah, um, I'm actually picking her up at seven before we head on over to the weekly watch meet. Is everything okay, Detective? It's hard to say, really. I'm still leaning towards Stephen as the prime suspect in this case, but there's some people above me who claim that he wouldn't have murdered his ex. So I wanted to ask you. Do you think it's him? I just don't know anymore. I mean, I never would've thought my husband would've been capable of doing what he did either, but... yes, I have a hard time believing it was Stephen just based on circumstance alone. And I don't suppose that your husband could've had any involvement in this situation, could he? You said he's not in the picture, right? Well, he wasn't, as of a week ago, but... But what? I think he's worth looking into. Okay. Well, thank you. - I'll be in touch, okay? - Thanks. You know that, you know, I'm here for you, if you need anything at all. 'Cause I've been thinkin' about you, worryin' about you. - So you call me, you hear me? - Okay. And you too, you too. - Thank you. - All right. She's sweet. So they're lookin' for James now? Yeah. But they're wrong. It's a bunch of crap, my dad would never kill anybody, he just has a hot head. No, Jamie, you have a hot head, your father has real mental problems. You just don't wanna admit that it really could be Stephen, and I know it is. Keep movin', nothing's happenin' here. So, what else did the cops say? They're gonna have patrol cars circling the neighborhood for the next few nights. Just to be safe. I think that's a good idea. No, I'm gonna ask Terrence to cover the gate. I think someone should be with you guys at all times. Barrett, you don't have to do that. It's okay, I want to. Besides, I think Jamie's got a point. I mean, I don't feel so comfortable knowing that Stephen's right next door. At least, until they talk to James and they've had a chance to question him. All right, I guess we should get inside and try to survive this. I'm gonna stay back here, keep an eye on things. - Okay. - Yeah. Good evening, ladies. I know this has been an extremely difficult week for everyone here in Shady Grove. Never in a million years would I've thought when I moved into this gorgeous neighborhood after selling my first house here and falling madly in love with it, that we would be shocked with such horrible tragedy. Tragedy? I think it was murder. You're right, it was murder. But it is a tragedy. When we're supposed to stick together and support each other as neighbors during these hard times, and instead, we point fingers at our innocent neighbors as though they are responsible for the callous acts of others. She's so full of... I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now, at this time, I beg of our neighborhood watch to do the right thing and bring this heinous charade to a halt, so that we can come together as a team and bring the real murderer to justice. But you know what, you guys, we don't even know who the real murderer is, do we? And, so far, the only evidence we have points to that man... right the... - Let me go! - Hey, hey, hey! Lindsay, call the detective. Tell him to get over here. Hi, this is Kat Riley from Shady Grove. 252, Sherwood Lane. Lindsay? Lindsay, I want you to listen to me real good, okay? I'm not going to jail. I'm not. Not for a bunch of nonsense that yougot me into in the first place. James, please. Please put the gun down, okay? Let's talk like adult parents should, okay? No, no, no, don't give me crap about being adult! You... You... shacked up with that psycho shrink who beats and murders his girlfriend, and then, you allow my daughter to be with him! - What are you talking about? - She told me everything. I know exactly what's goin' on here. So... So... I'm taking Jamie, and we are leaving. - No, you aren't. - Dad, please stop, please stop. Mom has nothing to do with this. I-I told you that. Sweetheart, sweetheart, don't try to protect her when I'm trying to protect you. Wh-what's your problem? Get out of the way. Look, man, if you really are innocent, this is no way to go about clearing your name. I-I don't know who the hell you are, anyway. Oh... wait. This is him? What's his name, Stephen? James... You got a lot of nerve makin' moves on my ex-wife, asshole. I got a long text from that Valerie lady tellin' me everything you are capable of the night you killed her. If anyone should be put behind bars, it's this man. Honey, let's go. What exactly had you told your father up until now, Jamie? Um, I told him that I was... I-I-I thought that-that the man my mom was seeing had-had killed his ex, and we were just texting a few days before, and he was, he was worried about me. Had you informed him of Miss Hyde's harassment at any point before her murder? Yes, but I'm telling you, he didn't kill her. E-even if she did contact my dad to warn him about Stephen, my dad was never there. He was never there. Did he mention that she had contacted him at any point after her death? No, no, he was just worried about me with Stephen, and, and he wanted to come pick me up. Logan... I found this in a suitcase in the back of Porter's car. You can walk us down with the passport. - It's Valerie's phone. - What? What... No, no. No, it's not. It's... Okay, listen, ladies. If Mr. Porter is guilty of Miss Hyde's homicide, I can assure you that we're gonna do our best to make certain that he's found guilty. Okay? Thank you. All right. - Okay, that feels good? - There you go. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. Okay. - Cheers. - Cheers to this. Look, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I shouldn't have treated you that way. You know what, Kat, it's really tough for me to gauge whether or not you're telling the truth. In fact, I'm not even sure if you know whether or not you're telling the truth. Maybe you're right, but I'm trying to change. Maybe we could try again? Yeah? How are you trying to change? Well, I, I let Lindsay take over the neighborhood watch program again. Yeah, I thought that was because everyone said they wanted Lindsay back. Funny. Maybe I misheard. Cheers to you workin' on yourself for a change. Good luck with that. You're a brave man for inviting Kat here tonight. Well, she was the one who called the cops the other day. Sticky situation for all of us, so... If I had been here when that had happened, then you wouldn't have needed to call the cops because I would've whooped James' ass from here to next week. I've been wanting to for years. Well, you can say, this guy did a pretty good job by himself. And, of course, our other knight in shining armor. I mean, who needs cops when you've got the cavalry right down the street, right? Hear, hear. Cheers. - Cheers. - To the neighborhood. Goodnight, you're so welcome. - Thank you for having us. - Aww. Si, si, si. Magnificent, Stephen. Nice to see you. - Party was great. - Oh, thank you. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you, guys. Glad you guys could make it. - I'll see you at the gym. - Yes. - Bye. - Goodnight, guys. Hey, Mom, do you think I could stay the night at Nikki's? She wanted to watch that new Scott Eastwood. - Um, yeah, I think so. - Yay. But don't let them stay up too late watching movies. Are you kidding me? I'm staying up late to watch, too. - Thanks, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye. I'll see you. Bye. Well, uh, goodnight. Goodnight, guys. Well, that's a goodnight from me, too. You, uh, want me to walk you home? Uh, no, I'm good. Thank you. What do you got going on the rest of the night? Oh, I gotta go relieve Terrence. What? You're working tonight? Yeah, why else do you think I only had one beer? Someone's gotta keep this neighborhood safe and warm. All right. Thank you. Yeah, I don't think he likes me a lot. You just gotta give him some time. He's just very protective. Uh-huh. Besides... what matters is that I like you. Oh, really? - Wanna come over? - Mm... - Yeah. - Okay. S-Stephen? Kat? What-what are you doing? I think he's... I think he's dead. C-can you, please, just put that thing down? And-and just walk away. What? You-you think I did this? I-I just walked in and-and found him like this. Look what's in your hand, Kat. Well, I didn't, I-I just pulled it out of him, because it was sticking out of him like a... I didn't do this. I gotta call the cops. No, no, no, wait. I'm telling you, it wasn't me. I-I just got a text from Stephen telling me to come over, so I did. But when I walked in the door, I-I found him like this. You can explain that to the police. I got your text. You okay? - Yeah. Look at Stephen. - Yeah. I've already called the police, they're on their way. Please, Lindsay, tell him to get the gun off me, please. I-I didn't do this. Let's just wait till the police arrive, yeah? Here, look at this. I swear to you, Stephen asked me to come over. So, what if he did? He asked you to come over here and talk to him, and then what? You decided you didn't like what he had to say, so you stuck a skewer in his gut? 'Cause you're insane! It's not true. I did not hurt him, I couldn't hurt him. Lindsay, please, l-look at me. I'm... I'm a lot of things, but I'm not a murderer. You know that. W-what if it was someone else? Like who? Come on, Linds, you are too trusting. For all you know, he still could've been screwing this one behind your back. Or maybe you did this. Since, clearly, you hate his guts. You've got to be kidding me, Kat. I'm the only one she can trust. Damn it! I wish I'd silenced that. You see? I told you it wasn't me. And I really wish I'd silenced you. Barrett, what is going on? Are you really that clueless? Come on, I have been in love with you since the first day I started working for you. I only ever wanted to protect you and Jamie. You don't work for me, you work for the neighborhood. Oh, screw those idiots! With their lies and their cheating and their shallow shells of real humanity. You just killed Stephen! Yeah! And I had to kill Val, too. But that was your fault, Linds. That was your fault, you see, 'cause you couldn't just trust me, could you? You couldn't just trust me when I had clearly earned that trust! Yeah. That was all me, baby. That was all me. The skewers, the first night I overheard you and him talking after your date. The black bouquet? The gym note that you assumed was from Val. That was all me, baby. All me! I don't understand. Of course. I wanted you to think it was from Val. Then maybe you would've left him alone. Or, it would've given him some real motive to take out his ex. Then... he would've ended up in jail. Valerie never would've shared in our dirty little secret, and you and I... we could've just gone back to the way the things used to be. Do you realize that you haven't brought me a morning coffee once since you two met? A morning coffee? Barrett, is that what this is about? Barrett, what about Valerie? How did you even know about her before anything happened? Don't get me wrong. She was snoopin' around the neighborhood. She came by here a few nights in a row claiming she was interested in the house for sale on Aspendale. Finally, she admitted to being Stephen's ex. S-so you just let her? Yeah, well, I realized that this little problem between Lindsay and Stephen wasn't gonna go away on its own, so, yeah, that was when I got my big idea! Of course, I made her promise to keep quiet about our little interaction. And James? Well, when I realized that Stephen was gonna get away with the perfect murder that I had framed for him, I realized that I needed a plan B. So I started posing as the crazy lady stalking his ex-wife and kid. And when I sent James a text from Val's phone, saying that his kid's life was in danger around mom's new "hot man..." Bang! Daddy's back! But, of course, I really wish she would've killed Stephen that night. But as it turns out, your ex-husband... isn't as crazy as you made him out to be, Linds. Well, clearly not as crazy as you. Well, if James is going to jail for the murder of Valerie based on the phone that I threw in his car, and you are going to jail for the murder of everyone else based on your little hot home invasion here, certainly, it sounds to me like I'm more so the war hero, and you are the crazy one, dear. Barrett, I did... I did bring you coffee one night. But you weren't there, you were with her. Jamie, what are you doing here? I f-forgot my phone at the pool, and then, I... Guys, go! Go! I don't know... I don't know where I left it, Mom! - Where is it? - This way. My ph... I think it's over here. Go! 9-1-1, what's... Thank you. Okay. Jamie, go! At least you trusted me with the combination and a spare key. Go! Mom, Mom, what're we gonna do? Did you see what he did to Kat? Oh, please, baby, please, just be quiet, okay? Look, he is not gonna hurt us, do you understand me? - Okay. okay. - He's... I really wish it didn't have to be this way, Linds. But you really created quite the conflict for me this evening. 'Cause now I have to make it look like it's your innocent boyfriend who's responsible for this whole ordeal. Thank God. Thank God, he's still alive! Hey! Jamie... all I ever wanted was to be your dad one day. You will never be my father! Barrett, you said you wanted this? How're you doing? Hey... Don't worry about me, I'm okay. I plan on sticking around here a while. That is if you'll have me. - I'll see you soon, okay? - Okay. Is it just me or... am I officially responsible for creating theworst neighborhood watch program in existence? Well, it at least cleared Dad's name. Yeah. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I heard Rita Barnes is putting her house up for sale. Well, if that's the case, maybe our neighborhood watch program wasn't a total failure after all. Hmm.
