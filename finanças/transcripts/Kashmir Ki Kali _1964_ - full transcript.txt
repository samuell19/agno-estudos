Subtitle synced by Anomixxx Today's day... ...it's a very big day for all of us... ...and also should be proud on this day! Before 25 years... ...Late Sanjeevlalji... ...had done the opening of this mill! Since then... ...our mill... ...is progressing day by day! Today's meet... ...is called for celebrating our silver jubilee! On this happy occasion... ...I want to give you a piece of good news! Sir Sanjeevlal's son... ...Sir Rajeevlal... ...is taking the entire responsibility... ...of this mill. He is our new boss! My fellow workers...! In today's world, there is nothing like a boss and an employee! These days servants are treated as bosses... ...and bosses are treated like servants! This is the time of workers! It's your time! Sir! What are you saying? If today your father would have been alive... These people would have abused him! So I was saying... ...my father had started this factory with 6 lakh rupees in hand! In these 25 years... ...more than a crore... ...we have crossed excessive profits! I am talking mother! Why are you taking pains! Ladies and gentlemen! Being happy with your honesty and hard work... ...my mother has decided to gift you worth 5 lakh rupees! Rajeev! You just say a yes! Yes! Why did you say a yes? Because he announced the reward on my name so... ...what else could I do? You could have left on me! I would have told every, Rajeev overheard. It was not 5 lakhs it was 5000! Late Sanjeevlalji used to worship money after God! 5 lakh rupees will go in vain... ...and this would really hurt him. I will pray for his soul! If Rajeev keeps donating in this manner... ...you will have to pray everyday! We had to face losses right after taking the responsibility in hand. If you extract a pot full of water from the sea... ...it doesn't make a big difference! He is a wealthy person! If Raju donated 5 lakh rupees... ...so what happened? Mother, Karuna has brainwashed Rajeev from childhood! And I have even nourished him! I don't want to answer this maid. Shaamlalji, Karuna was never addressed like a maid! When did I say so? I am your manager since 30 years! It's my duty to see take care of the money! Rajeev is the boss! He can donate the entire wealth! What are you saying, Shaamlalji! What will he say, Ranima! It's an arbitrary age! He will get married and will have children... ...after the responsibilities he'll stop behaving adolescent! Don't listen to him. You are right! This meant I was talking nonsense? - No! You did not understand, Shaamlalji! I was thinking about his wedding! In next 7 days I will get him married! So soon? But Ranima, we'll take time finding a girl. What is not possible if we don't try, Shaamlalji? You call some girls from good families; I will select the best one! But Raju has to get married... ...ask him first! I will have to ask my son to get a daughter in law? Why do I do so? I will select a girl for him! Shaamlalji... ...you can go! - Yes! Welcome! She is Kala! Shaamlalji, I don't want a middle class girl! I am not as wealthy as you are but even I have some class! Shaamlalji... He is her father. I understood! She wears such tight clothes.. ...I thought you couldn't afford decent clothes! - Mummy! This is in vogue. I respect my father... ...otherwise there are girls who even wear tighter clothes than this! Shaamlalji! I don't want a girl who calls me mummy! Don't worry. See next! Greetings! How do I praise my own daughter with my own mouth? She doesn't wear anything besides 'Khadi'. Do you worship everyday? Worshipping? Every morning, she reads 'the Ramayana' for 3 hours... ...and in the evening she reads Mahabharata for 3 hours! She must be singing devotional songs in the afternoon! Go ahead. I like your daughter! Touch her feet. Live long. My son has arrived! Come here Raju! What happen to your leg? He is limping! Rajeev! He is deaf? Rajeev why are you misbehaving? I don't want to ruin my daughter's life! Come on! You talk like your son deserved! Look how good is your son. Come on. Why are we sitting? Why did you behave in this manner? When you know I don't want to get married! You won't marry? No! But I have chosen a girl for you! It's surprising mother... ...I have to get married and you'll select? Rajeev! You will get married in a reputed family! Even you are from a wealthy family. Is it necessary for me to get married in a wealthy family? I will get married to a girl of my choice. What is your choice? Even I want to know! I have never seen such a girl! But I have her picture in my mind! Naive, innocent, humble, sweet-looking, I hate all these modern girls! You will have to get married to the girl of my choice. I ruin my life because of your stubborn behavior? Marriage is a question of entire life! It's not a playful act. He will have to get married. That too my choice! Hello! Why are you shouting? I am Chandar! From the club. I am waiting for you, here. You are drunk! I have never even tasted! Is it? Taste then. Do you have permission? No! Waiter quickly give me a coke! Do you know why I drink? Yes, who doesn't know what have you gone through! It's not my habit nor do I need it! But I need it! He is very boring! We will sit here. Your coke. I'll give some good news. People used to call me your flunkeys! But now I am insurance agent! What? Insurance agent. First thing... ...I will get you insured... My mother is getting me insured! What? An agent reached at your place before me? Shut up. Boy! Colonel, I was not telling you. Chandar, my mother wants me to get married! Thank you, Thank you! - Shut up! I am very upset! My mother had invited many girls today! How were they? Rubbish, all were bad! I banished them all! I don't get even one, and you banished them! Chandar, don't joke around. It is a very serious thing! Why don't you find a girl of your choice? I haven't ever liked any girl! Search for one! You will have to get married someday! Look, I don't want to get married! Tell me how to escape from here! Even Kamala had escaped. Even you run away! What? He is right. Where will I go? Go to Kashmir! You have your house there! Bholaraam works under you. And Ranima never goes there. Right! You are right! You come along! No! It's the question of my job. Resign! I shouldn't work being you friend! What a shame on me! - Correct. But I'll take 2 days to resign. You take my car and leave I'll join you later! Promise? Promise! "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "There are many beautiful faces..." "...I am confused between whom to select." "Who is mine?" "Who will stay with me forever?" "Cheerful and happy." "Cheerful, happy and fun loving." "She will come in life today." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "I am searching for a world..." "...that is called love" "I am searching for a world..." "...that is called love." "Who are those lucky people..." "...who stay in this world?" "I will go there" "I will go there" "I will meet my dream girl." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "She should be tender..." "...just like dew." "Her face looks like moon..." "...when she sleeps in the night." "Intoxicated eyes." "Rosy cheeks." "Intoxicated eyes, rosy cheeks." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." "At some point of time..." "...somewhere, I will have to love someone." Greetings! Serve tea to all the girls. Where are they coming from? From Pathanpur! They are Champa's friends! They come every year to the fair! Every year they come? Why not? This is a very beautiful place! I have left Kulu 10 years ago! But they look like they are Kashmiris! Their choice! Till the time they stay in Kashmir they wear the Kashmiri outfit! Now stop talking nonsense! Serve them hot tea. I have to go to Srinagar. How will you get there? - Why? The wooden bridge is broken! How is that possible? It was completely fine in the morning. In the afternoon, it rained heavily and the cyclone... ...shattered it completely! That way won't open before morning! I will have to stay here in the night. Are there empty rooms available? You sleep in my room! What are you all laughing for? Have your tea and get up! Anybody there? Who is the owner of this lodge? I am the one. Any room is empty? No! What? There were 2 empty rooms and now they are occupied. Please help me! I want to go to Srinagar and the roads are blocked! Where will I go at this time? Give me 3 rupees! Go and sleep below that staircase! In this chilling weather? I can't do anything more for you. Listen... ...at least arrange for a fireplace! Ok! Give me 2 rupees! Go! Come! Where is it burning? Just look! Pour water! What is this? Why did you pour water? Sorry by mistake, we thought fire has erupted somewhere! At least see first. How would we see when there was only smoke! Why did you fire? What happen? They poured water from top. What did you except them to shower flowers? Definitely, he must have done something! I gave him place thinking he is a decent man. I was setting fire and was making my bed! What did we know? We saw smoke and felt something's burning. You have become cold! Everyone sleep now! Rajeev, you will die of cold! Kashmir! I have to go to Srinagar! It's very cold! You? You had poured water! Weird girl... You first pour water then give me a blanket! What is your name? Recognized me? You? I heard your voice and came here! And I even met you. Elsewhere would I find you? Why? I wanted to thank you in the night because you ran away! Seriously. If you wouldn't have helped me... ...I would have frozen in cold! You left in the morning... ...I kept finding for you. Why? You forgot? I have your belonging! What? Bucket! What nonsense! Correct! You seem to be old friends! We thought you both met last night for the first time! Shut up! You people are shameless! No, we pick flowers! Listen! Even she picks flowers! Wait! Listen! Listen. Wait! Listen! What is it? Your blanket! It doesn't belong to me! It is from the lodge! What will I do with it? Throw it. Throw it? Listen! This is the way to Srinagar? Yes! You are going to Srinagar? Yes! Sit in the car. I will drop you. I have a habit of walking. Nothing will change in one day! Last night you helped me today I will help you. I thought you are poor and so I helped you. I didn't know you were rich! Really? But how do you know I am rich? This car! It doesn't belong to me. Then? You are a driver? Driver? You have dressed up like you are a rich man. Its my bosses'! I mean my Sir's! He is a very good man! This dress is also his! A gift! I misunderstood you! Everything is on a rent! What? Your car is rented and even your clothes! What is yours? Mine? 1 heart! That is searching for someone! The one I like, I don't know her name... ...neither do I know her address! At least tell me your name! Whose name and address do you want to know, sir? Not your concern. If you tease these innocent girls, you will fall in a big problem! Please do your work! My work was to explain you... ...and my name is Mohan! Do keep in mind! Come here, look. Hey Parshuram! - I am coming Sir Mohan! Everything's fine? - Yes sir! Okay I am leaving then! Sir Mohan, lend me 10 rupees! Again you need 10 rupees? - It's very necessary! Bholaraam! Hey Bholaraam! Who are you? Who are you? How did you come here? Leave this house! Shut up! Who asked you to enter the house? Hey Mr. we have given a rent of 3 months in advance! What rent? We have booked this hotel for the entire season! Is this a hotel? Then what is it? I will call the police! No! We will call the police! Maya kindly call the police! A scoundrel has forcibly entered our hotel. Hotel Lake View? - Yes! This is Hotel Lake View? Are you going or should I call the police? Have you heard Sir Rajeev's name? Yes! We have heard! I am the one. You are Raju? Girls! Girls you are back? Go and change your clothes! Who is he? He is Sir Rajeevlal! Sir Rajeevlal! Who said? He himself said so! He said and you all accepted? Yes! Silly girls... ...Bholaraam wouldn't inform us if our sir would be arriving? Where is Bholaraam? Where is he? I am asking! Who are you to ask me? You want to fool us? Leave from here! Who are you? Who are you? I am Ramadevi! I am her guardian! Understood? Ramadevi. Keep your cool! After Bholaraam arrives... Before Bholaraam comes, you flee from here! Get out. Shut up! Girls, what are you looking at him? Whack him with your bats! Hey Bholaraam! - Sir, you? Who made a hotel here? Sir, I made! - Why? Since many years you people had not visited this place... ...I used to feel lonely here! Shut up! I was insulted there! Remove everyone from the bungalow! How is this possible, Sir? I have taken an advance from them and even given them a receipt. I don't know all that. Everyone should be out by evening! Till then I'll stay somewhere else! You can't stay here! What do you mean? Ranima has sent a telegram... ...saying if you have come here, you have to immediately return back. And what did you answer? I haven't still given an answer, but I'll soon reply back to her! Bholaraam nobody should know that I am here! But Sir... ...I will have to reply back to her. Tell her I am not here. As you wish. But what about those girls? I can't remove them! Okay let them stay. I will stay somewhere else. What are you saying, Sir? This Hotel belongs to you! I will empty the room on the top for you. But by mistake I told those girls I am Rajeevlal! So what? I will manage! How? Leave it on me! I will make up something! You wait here for five minutes... ...I will be right back! Bholaraam... ...you are simply the best! I serve you, Sir! Welcome, Sir! I have made all the arrangements for you in the room on top! Where are they? They must be hiding somewhere around in fear! In fear, what do you mean? Means... ...I have said something... ...that has frightened them and they won't dare to face you! Very good! Have they shifted from here? Look around, Sir! I am seeing! He started with his madness! Bholaraam, lock him in the room! What? Whom is she calling mad? Not you. I said you are Sir's friend! But he thinks he is Sir Rajeevlal! What do you mean? I mean you are... A psychic? No, No nothing like that! I had just told them! You started throwing things at them and they will start believing! Have you really lost it? It is very necessary for me to behave in that manner since you've told! Sir, I couldn't think of anything else! No one will consider you as Sir Rajeevlal... ...and no one will be there to harass you. Very good... ...what an idea! Do you want anything, Sir? No! You did a good job of removing them from here! What book is this? An evening in Paris! The girls had kept it here! The smell will remain for few more days! I don't like this artificial fragrance. I will get you some fresh flowers tomorrow morning! It will make you feel fresh! Bholaraam... ...I have heard girls sell flowers here! Even boys sell! I want special varieties of flowers. You get them immediately! Who are you? What do you want? Heard some wealthy merchant has come to stay! They really like flowers! You don't have the kind of flowers he wants! At least have a look! Many florists had come to sell these flowers! Sir sent them back! Now go! Bholaraam! Bholaraam! - Yes Sir. Quickly. Come up! Coming, Sir! Some florist had come? She didn't have that special variety so I fled her! Send her here! I saw her flowers! I want to see her flowers go and send for her! Sir! Who is it? Florist! Come in. I am in. Which flowers do you have? I have roses, lotus, jasmine! How much is it for? 5 rupees for the entire basket. Keep the basket here. Yes! You won't get such flowers anywhere in Kashmir. These are Champa's flowers! You are lying? Not a single magnolia is there in the basket! No, No. I am Champa! What else can it be? You? Yes me! You are staring at me like you have never seen me! How are you here? I am Sir's driver! Then why did you sit on his chair? I behave like my sir, when my sir is not around! He is not there? He has gone to meet our madam! He told me to buy flowers from a florist. Please buy. Then I won't have to wander in sun! Take this. 20 rupees! This is too much. It's less. My Sir would have given 50 rupees if he was in my place. 50 rupees? Yes! You were right your master is a great man. And me? You? Even you are a nice man. Champa if I buy your flowers every day... ...what will you gift me? Whatever you want! Can I pin this flower in your hair? I thought you'll ask for money! Here! Pin it! Make it quick! What if your master comes? I will tell him, I love you! If he asks you, even you accept! I don't lie. Even I don't lie. You just lied. What? That you...! I love you? I do love you. Definitely. Yes! It's true. Don't joke. You will come back tomorrow? I don't know. Leave me. Say you will! Say! I will come! You came early today? Yes father! I am very happy today! You have sold all the flowers today! Yes father! And guess in how much! 25 paise more! No father! 20 rupees! 20 rupees? Yes father! The one who has bought them is a driver. He was saying, his sir would have given 50 rupees! Champa! Return him, his 15 rupees! Why father? We should take the equivalent money and nothing more! But if someone gives gladly! He definitely wants something then! No father! That driver is a very good man. You can't really make out anybody's intention by looking at his face! Return his money back to him. And don't go there again! I won't go! But we need money. What is the need to return it? No child you don't know... ...a man can trait his soul for money! He becomes a devil! Father! My child... ...be satisfied... ...in what you get! Chandar... ...don't worry about it. Wait at the airport I am coming to pick you up. Yes! Chandar babu will also stay here? Yes! I called you the fake owner, what will I call him? Make him the real boss! Tell everyone he is Sir Rajeevlal! I will explain Chandar! No words I have for you! Bholaraam! Your Sir has still not arrived! Bholaraam, you should have gone to pick him. Why did you send that psychic? Bholaraam! How is he in looks? Tell us! He has arrived. Salute the boss. You are saluting the fake boss? Salute the real boss! She is Ramadevi! Greetings! They are Chhaya, Maya, Rekha! What? Rekha, Maya, Chhaya! Greetings Sir! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! My friend is... ...mad! He calls himself Sir Rajeevlal! Are you married Sir? No! I am finding a girl! What kinds? The one I can get married to. According to my father's will I have to get married before I turn 30. What is your age, Sir? Yes? He is three years younger to me! And I am three years younger to him! I am sorry, my friend is insane! He is worse than the previous one! But he is wealthy! He is finding a girl to get married! We should plan something! How did I act? Very good. You acted like a joker! Even those girls believed me! They did not believe you! They are only concerned with money! Another fool was also enough to convince them! Don't say this! 3 girls at the same time have a crush on me! You will suffer, what do I do? Sir! Who is it? I have work with the real boss and not with you! That florist had again visited us today! You didn't ask her to wait? You have even got a driver along with you? Answer to what you are asked to! She left? She didn't give me a chance to talk. She gave me 15 rupees and she left! And has said when his driver comes hand it over to him! Since then I am thinking... ...Who is this driver? I am the driver! Who is Seth Sanjeevlal's son? I am also his son! I had paid her, why did you take them? 1 basket costed you 20 rupees? What's the matter? Nonsense! Where did she go? - To the market! To the market? How does she look? She is a daughter to me! There is no one in this boat... ...these flowers will die under the sun! Take me near the boat. I will sprinkle some water! You? I thought there is no one in the boat! Shut up. You wet my clothes! The other day you showered cold water on me! I didn't get angry that day! You have come to take a revenge of that day? No! I am here to ask you, why did you return my money? Why? Say! When a guy pays 20 rupees for 5 rupees... ...he is not a good guy. Really? Who said? My father! And you believed him? This means you like me? When did I say so? You didn't say? When will you say? You please leave! They all are coming! - Who? Girls! I can't see any girl except you! Go please! Else I will... What else can you do? "Your moon-like illuminating face..."

I have just caught your hand... ...you have spent one entire day with that car owner! Are you leaving me? Father! Father! What happen? What happen? It's like... ...Champa is losing herself! Who is it? Mohan? Yes Father. Ask her where was she the entire day? It started raining very heavily today! So I had to stay at one place. With that guy who owns the car? Whom are you talking about? A met a decent man on my way! He saved my life. Else I wouldn't have been alive today. No, don't say this. My child has to really work hard all the time. If I wouldn't have been blind... ...I would have never allowed you to work. Still nothing's gone wrong... ...if you care about your reputation, stop her from going out! What do you mean? Champa is not a child any more. She is taking advantage of you being blind. Mohan. Dare if you say anything about Champa. I have complete faith in my daughter. On your daughter? Father, please tell him to go away from here! Who is he to interfere? You go inside! Go! Where are you? - In front of you! What do you know about Champa? Champa is not your daughter. How do you know? Things cannot be hidden! Look Mohan... Champa should never know this truth. Tell her from tomorrow she need not work. She is only allowed to go out with me! Understood? Father! I have prepared our food. I am coming. Today you prepared food little early? Yes I will sleep early today. I have to go to the fair tomorrow morning. With whom? I will go with a friend. No! Like every year I want you to go to the festival with your friends. In Mohan's festival? Yes, with your friends! But I don't wish to go! Champa! If you want to go for the fair, go with your friends! Else I won't allow you to go alone! Okay. I will go with him. I think for your good. Champa... Whose it? It's Munni. I am just coming. Champa tomorrow you are coming for the fair? Yes! Munni, inform Raju... ...I won't be able to meet him tomorrow. Now you have started meeting him every day? I feel you will get married soon! Why are you silent Champa? Talk to me, be happy! It's a big day today! I am thinking... ...I will take a sari worth 100 rupees! I have a sari to wear. You have everything, Champa! But you should have something of my choice! Why? Only because I like you! Look ahead! Stop the car. God has sent you to help me. Where are you going? To the fair. Take me along! My wife can't walk. She is pregnant. There is no place in the truck! Come in the next truck! Give them a lift. I refused him... ...so that your friends... ...who are going to come from Pathancoat... ...do not face any problems! If you say I will give them a lift. Come sit. God bless you! Live long! A man only understands a man's problem. My beloved, you sit here... ...I will make some place for you! How will I sit with your wife? I am not his wife. She is my wife to be. You sit with a stranger? You sit with my wife! I will sit with him! Get down. Get down. Wait Champa. You sit on the top! I will help you. What nonsense. You will touch her? You don't worry! My wife will help her! My beloved... (Regional) Khan, your wife is taller to you. You don't know, she is the shortest in her family. Rest all of them are even taller than her. It's surprising! You said your wife can't walk. My wife is a Pathani! Within her weakness lies her strength! Let's go, I'll tell some stories about her. Brother! What are you doing? Drive! Come on! Your Majesty... ...only girls are there. Why have you covered your face? We want to see your face. What will you do seeing my ugly face? You all are so beautiful. Who is the most beautiful amongst all? The most beautiful? Let me see! My back! She is the most beautiful of all. The one who sees her will fall for her.

You said your wife is pregnant. Now how did she run? My wife is a Pathani! She must have gone to see the fair! Let's find her! Come on! What if Mohan sees us? Even I will screw him. Come! Who is it? Where is your wife? I am still finding her. I haven't found her as yet. Find her quickly! I am finding her. Greetings! - Greetings! Who was the one who came along with you? He is my friend. Why did you do this? To meet you! Will you have water melon? Khan, seeing you I don't even feel... ...like your wife has escaped from here! I will eat and fill my stomach. I will find her then! We are not newly wedded that she will escape. She is my wife since 3 years! What is this? Can't you see? Why are you getting angry? Take money! Leave me! Take money! Run! - What happen? He is here! Let's go. "Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart." "If this remains forever, what else I want." "Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart."

"...since then I have lost control over my heart" "I lost myself and got you, that is written in my fate." "If this remains forever, what else I want." "Your hand in my hand with some new emotions in my heart." Father, where is Champa? She went to the fair. She went with me... ...but she ditched me in the fair and was with her beloved. What nonsense! Yes! You know it very well... ...your Champa has an affair with that guy! Don't shout. I will pull your tongue otherwise! You blame my innocent daughter! Is she your daughter? Anyway whoever's daughter she is... ...I just know one thing... ...if you don't get her married to me... ...I will nab her! Think! No one can hold grudges against me... ...and you can't take the help of police. Why? Because you know the reason. Understood? I will come back again! Barkha! Barkha! Mohan Sir, you? Give me some more time! I will pay off your debt! I excuse you! - What? I will give you 100 rupees more... ...if you find out Champa's parents! Champa? Yes! You were sloshed and in that state you said Champa is not his daughter. It is very old. When Dinu used to drink some years back... ...even he said it by mistake. But he never told me anything further! Don't tell him I am here! Come in. Come in. At this time you are here? Mohan had come home sometime back. He wants to get married to Champa. That's good. He is rich. He has some reputation. No! Champa is not worth him. You talk like she comes from an affluent family. Champa is a wealthy man's daughter. I haven't told this to anyone. I don't want... ...someone takes Champa away from me. I won't be able to live without her. Mohan intimidated me... ...so I had to come to you. Everyone is scared of Mohan. Do you know how dangerous is he? If he wants to get married to Champa he will do so! I will give up on my life... But you won't be able to stop him. Promise me, if anything happens to me... ...you will hand her over to her family! But where? You won't tell anybody, right? Are you mad? You are my old friend! Listen! There is a yellow voluminous bungalow at Srinagar near the Lake! I mean it was there some 20 years ago. It's still there! I had nabbed Champa from there! Robbed her? Yes!

You don't know me... ...But I know you. You? Bholaraam has given me your address! You are Dinu's sister? How do you know? Who are you? I will tell you everything. Your master even had a daughter, right? What? The one who was nabbed by your daughter! What do you know about it? Everything. I just don't know... ...what is her share in this property? This is all hers! But where is she? Do you know it? I do know. But I will tell you when time comes! Listen! Wait. Shaamlalji, Shaamlalji! Karuna! What happen Karuna? A man had come... ...he was talking about Rani! - What was he saying? She is alive! She is alive? Where is she? I will leave now. Wait for some more time please. Leave me.

Meet him then. You will introduce us. You are fast with all that. Who introduced us? A bucket of cold water! I had decided that very moment... ...the one who showered water... ...will make my queen. You talk like you are a king! I am not any less! If I can waive lakhs of rupees on you... ...what will you say? You are mad. I wasn't... ...you made me one. Leave me. Let me go. No! When I hold someone... ...he doesn't leave her easily. And how can you trust someone who is mad? Sometimes I even bite. Move. Have you really lost it? Yes! I have lost it. You, me! These flowers, buds.... ...the weather etc and look there... ...those clouds! How are they running! Even I am leaving. You are losing your mind.

"I washed away like dew" "...the waves didn't stop even though I tried to stop them" "...the waves didn't stop even though I tried to stop them." "There was confusion in my life."

Are you convinced? Me? If you are convinced, convince her too! Who will bestow your daughter if you are jailed? My dream girl... ...how did you come early this morning? Didn't you go to sell flowers?

And I will be the groom! Shameless! Harasses me today! Even my time will come! Father! Champa. You are back? Yes Father! What happen? You seem to be worried. I was thinking... ...to get you married. Father! You want to remove me from your house? No child! I will send you to a reputed family! I won't leave you and go! Silly girl. Daughter! Mohan has told me a several times... Mohan? Yes! He wants to get married to you. He is very rich. Father! You will sell your daughter in greed? Champa. Don't ever say this. Don't ever say this again! If you force me to get married to Mohan it's equal to killing me! Champa! Instead I will have poison! My daughter! Don't do this. I was not in my senses! I won't get scared of his threats! Threats? Nothing. Nothing. You have taken a loan... ...that is the thing right? How many rupees have you taken from him? I will take it from Raju. Raju? Who is he? That driver...!

The day you'll be the groom... ...that will be the day of your life! 3 days to go...! I don't get sleep at night. And even if I get sleep I only dream about Champa. You? How did you reach here?

With Mohan. Do come for the wedding! See me getting ruined with your own eyes! I didn't get a chance to clear your misconception. And now no use clearing it also. Come with me. Your mother is waiting for you. My mother? Yes! You have no idea who are you! Life is playing games with you. It has separated you from your mother! That's it. I understood. You want to cheat me! My father wouldn't have told me if my mother was alive? No! Because your father had nabbed you from her. The one you consider to be your father... ...he means nothing to you! Shut up! Leave from here. Champa! See what I got for you. A silk dress, some ornaments! - Father! I am not your daughter? Who told you? Raju said. He says my mother is alive! He is a liar and is even cunning! You are my daughter! Why did he say so? And how dare you call Champa your daughter? Who? - Raju! Rascal, Scoundrel! You cheated my daughter. You played with her feelings! How dare do you come here? Leave from here! I will go! But I will even take Champa along with me. No, No! No one can separate us! Nobody! Today you are afraid of losing a stranger? Imagine what would have happened to her mother! The day you nabbed her from her mother! Shut up. One more word... ...and I will kill you. I will kill you! - Father! You had killed me the same day.. ...when you had sold me for alcohol! Child! You are Raju? Child! Yes! Raju? Your child. Your unlucky child! Inspite of having a father lived like an orphan at someone's place! Stop it! I have got my punishment! Please don't hurt me anymore! I know... ...I have no rights to call you my son.

You are fine? I am fine, but save Raju! He is in danger! - Where is he? Behind those pipes! Be quick. "Your veil is in my hands." "Happiness comes with you." "My heart dances on seeing this." "Love stretches itself." "I became crazy just like a cloud." Subtitle synced by Anomixxx P.S. If the mkv file is jerky, demux the video and audio tracks separately and remux all together.
