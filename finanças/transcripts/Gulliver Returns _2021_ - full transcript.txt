Residents of beautiful Lilliput, today is a significant day. Indeed, today, our defender, our friend, Great Gulliver, will appear again after 40 years of separation, as our prophecy says. The Man Mountain will return to solve all our gigantic problems. Only the Great Gulliver can handle them. Who, 40 years ago, extinguished our capital in one motion when the villain Blefuscu set fire to it? Our savior, the Great Gulliver. And who restored the city walls 40 years ago and prevented the villain Blefuscu from invading our city, hmm? Ooh, our savior, the Great Gulliver. And who, 40 years ago, supplied water throughout the city? Our savior, the Great Gulliver! Come on, again. Who? Our savior, the Great Gulliver! I can't hear you. Who? Our savior, the Great Gulliver!

And now, we can put to good use the gigantic gate built for the return of the Man Mountain. Turn me around all the way. 180, please. Orchestra, music. Oh my goodness. Oh. There he is, Gulliver the Giant. Wow. I've never had such a welcome. Hmm. Shh. Mm-mm. Get him! Mm-hmm. Break it down. How dare you touch the crown of the Great King of Lupersburg, you pipsqueak? I'm the pipsqueak? Yes. You don't know who you're dealing with. First, I'll feed you to the piranhas. Then I'll feed these piranhas to the pigs. Then I'll kill the pigs, and the pigs will get eaten by the worms. Then I'll use these worms to catch fish. You've already mentioned the fish. They were piranhas. Now I'm talking about trout. Oh, okay, go on. And then, I'll fry the fish and eat it. Why don't you just fry the piranhas who ate me? Because, because... You don't know who you're dealing with! Hey, that looks great. Grab the pipsqueak! Idiots! Not me. Him! Remember this day. After all, today, you were robbed by the great, the unsurpassed, the pretty, some would even say beautiful, and I don't argue, the undefeated, whose name is Gulliver! I usually stick the landing. But you don't have to believe me. Enough with that. All hail the new heir to the crown of Lupersburg. Ah. Who cares? - Hey, what's your name? - Squick. Glad to meet you, Squick. I'm Gulliver. How do you say Gulliver? - Squick. - Also Squick? Oh. So we're namesakes. Huh? Um, hello, over here. I know you're here. I was just checking if I had a tail. A tail is a figure of speech. Delivery man Pablo salutes you. Gulliver, I heard a lot about you. I thought you'd be bigger. - I'm Gulliver. - Oh. You two look so much alike. So what's the mouse's name? His name is Squick. - Karl? - Not Karl, Squick. - Karl, right? - Squick. - I can't hear you. Karl? - Squick! So it's Karl, then. - Yes, Karl. - Mm, Karl. Not really a good name for a mouse. It's not mousey at all. Well, have a nice trip and a fair wind to you all. Wait. What about the message? Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So? - So? - So? What do you mean? You need to deliver the message. I know. But you keep interrupting me all the time, I can't put a word in. Now. My side's been itching all this time. Now for the message. "Don't forget to buy the potion and ointment, you old fart." No, no, no, that's not for you. That's personal. Here it is. "Dear Gulliver, we are in trouble. Please come to our aid. Residents of Lilliput." My friends are in trouble. Squick, get ready to set sail immediately. Let's go to Lilliput. I need to be on my way, too. So many things to do. All you talkers and you talks, you talk and talk and talk. - And you don't stop. - Thanks for the message, Pablo. See you soon, Gulliver. - Karl. - Squick. How could you name a mouse Karl? Like to freshen up, you know? And remember, in Lilliput, you'll be surrounded by danger everywhere. Hello! What? Perhaps I'm too far away. You, you, who are you? I'm Gulliver. What do you mean, "Gulliver"? And where--where is our friend, the giant? Giant? I didn't see one on my way into port. Don't worry. I'm sure he's around here somewhere. So how 'bout we get the party going, huh? The festive music was a great touch. How 'bout we start the band up again? I am going to ask you once more, who are you? Uh, like I said, I'm Gulliver. This is not Gulliver! Aw. It's not Gulliver. What do you mean, I'm not Gulliver? My name is Lemuel Gulliver. Silence! Lemuel Gulliver is a giant. And this some kind of impostor, not Gulliver! Aw. - But--but I am. - Enough! Seize him! If you really are Gulliver, then prove it, in court. My case file. Squick, can you get it? All right, eat it. Yeah, imagine that it's the food that you love the most. - Sweets? - Sure, sweets. Hurry up. Get out of there. Hmm? Where did they put my daily schedule? Oh, never mind. All rise. The court is in session. The court shall swiftly adjudicate without carefully considering the case, given that dinner is in 10 minutes. Excuse me. Hmm, yes? You have some questions. I have one small question, if you will. What on Earth is going on here? It's only been a year since the last time I was here, but I don't recognize anyone. You're the king, right? I don't know you. I know him, but not you. That's my father. Oh, then we have met. Back then, Your Majesty was smaller, and ran around in dirty diapers. How is this even possible? And how is it possible-- And how is it possible that you're not a giant? Hmm. Maybe, maybe because I've never been one. What do you mean, never been one? You must be a giant. We have a legend. We have murals, monuments, those huge gates, even. Do you know how much they cost? And now, you return as a non-giant? You spoiled everything for us. This is a scandal, and you must pay. For what? For being who I am? No, for not being what you should be. So the verdict is guilty, and you shall serve a life sentence. Hold on a second. We haven't even had a trial. What kind of a kangaroo court is this? The court has considered the statement of the defense and passes the floor to the prosecution. Mr. Prosecutor? For mocking a trial in Lilliput, the penalty is death. Death? It is my opinion that you do not know the laws, Mr. Prosecutor. I know the laws better than anyone in this kingdom. Better than the king himself? Would you believe it? Better than the king himself. Your Honor, it is clear that the prosecutor does not respect both the court and the king. Oh. How dare you, Mr. Prosecutor, be so bold. For disrespecting the king, you are sentenced to a strike by the chicken. Oh! Well, Mr. Prosecutor, how did you like that? Let us return to you, Mr. Impostor. Do you understand the decision of the court? Shouldn't a verdict be passed by a jury? No problem. Guilty. He's a-guilty. Guilty. The decision is unanimous. You are found guilty of being Gulliver, but not being a giant. A double crime! Now you will be executed on the spot. But that's not fair! I must have a lawyer. The lawyer is here, your honor. Really? Your honor. Your honor, the defense would like to bring to your attention a mitigating circumstance before you sentence the defendant. Oh yeah? What circumstance? The defendant is, in fact, a giant. He is from a family of giants, but because of a childhood illness, he stopped growing. It seems that the defendant is just a giant dwarf. - Oh. - Or dwarf giant, whichever you like. - Oh. - Yes, it's true. This is my affliction. This is my shame. You don't understand what it's like to be a dwarf among giants. Always the last one picked for sports, wearing children's clothes all your life. Understanding that society only cares about you when they need someone with a small hand to get the last pickle out of the jar. The court accepts this mitigating circumstance. Taking into account the mitigating-- mitigating circumstance, the defense asks for a public execution tomorrow at the square. - What? - Excellent idea, lawyer. Oh, set a table, have music and dancing? How cool. The court grants the defense's request. No! I lied! I'm not a dwarf. Punish me to the fullest extent with a life sentence. Better still, be even harder and expel me from jail, or drive me out of the country. I can make bail. Do you accept crowns? Squick, help me! Get them, Squick! The guards are sweets. Sweets? Sweet? Sweet. If you inhabitants if the insignificant Lilliput surrender, then the great and mighty Generalissimo Blefuscu, that is me, will have mercy on you, and just maybe I will allow you to be my slaves for the rest of your worthless lives. But if you refuse to surrender, then my immense army will grind you into powder. And now, no one will interfere. - Oh! - - My Generalissimo, the great spies-- - Peter... -.. and Peter have arrived-- ...as you commanded. I told you never interrupt my sinister laugh. Sorry, my Generalissimo. Go on, please. See? You've spoiled all the fun. - Have mercy on us. - We didn't meant to. It's just that we have important news. All right, out with it. Gulliver has arrived in Lilliput. So, the legendary Gulliver returns. Good. I will capture Lilliput and at the same time, I will avenge Blefuscu's past defeat. But he's not quite Gulliver. What? What does that mean? - Well. - - It's hard to explain. He's not really a giant. Meaning what? More precisely, he's not a giant at all. This Gulliver is an impostor. - What? - They seized him. - Put him in the dungeon. - And he's to be executed. Well, now. Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure that he's not a giant? Yes, my Generalissimo. How big is he? He is much smaller than you, my Generalissimo. Then it will be much easier than I thought. Listen! Go to the king of Lilliput and ask him to surrender. - Yes, my Generalissimo. - Goodbye, my Generalissimo. Thank you for having us, my Generalissimo. All the best, my Generalissimo. Looking good, my Generalissimo. - Good health to you, my-- - Get out already! Idiots. But it's nice that they worry about my health. What a teeny giant. That's right, like a baby giant. Hmm. Squick. Ta-da! Squick, hmm? Nonsense. It's been a long day. You gotta eat something. It's been too long. Squick could be in trouble. Don't worry, buddy. I'm coming. Okay, just like I learned it. Left and wait for a clicking sound. Excellent. Although, in my opinion, the lock should have clicked, not my finger. It's okay. I've got nine more tries left. Ah. Good evening, Mr. Imprisoned Impostor. My respects, Your Majesty. I've noticed that you are quite versatile. You are the king, and the judge and the prosecutor, and now you're the head guard? It's amazing! Oh yes, I like to try new things, and even more so, if you want something done right, as you know, you best do it yourself. I daresay, Your Majesty, you are good at being head guard. Thanks, I'm trying. How are you? Have you settled in? They treating you well? I wouldn't want you to spoil the festive mood of tomorrow's execution with a sour face. I'm wonderful, and I have you to thank. Not at all. Wait. You are thanking me for what? For what? Just look at my apartment. This is my bedroom, which is also the cloak room, and the laundry room. A quick walk down the hall, and we arrive at the bathroom, which also serves as an office. In the left corner, I have a greenhouse, and through the living room, we arrive at the kitchen. In general, everything is compact, convenient, and modern. It is cozy. And the food here, with free delivery? This is called le goop. Mm. It's just delicious. Um, may I try it? No, no, no. It's only for prisoners. You're right. I've never been a prisoner. It's not that easy. You think you're up for it? Yes, of course I am! I'm not so sure. I'll prove it to you. This really is cute. Cool. I envy you. Stop! I demand you to stop. Something wrong? You forgot the keys. You're right. How could I forget? This is the life. Love that crisp dungeon air. Hmm. Squick. Where are you, boy? Squick? Who are you? Marcy. I'm your lawyer. Oh, right. Look, it's my lawyer. Let me guess. You came to suggest they torture me before the execution? Is this how you thank me for saving you? Saving me? Bringing me to the scaffold is your way of saving me? If it weren't for me, you would've been executed right in the courtroom. Ah, I see. Getting executed in the square is much better. Exactly, I bought you time to escape. Thanks, but I think Squick and I will manage without you. Have you seen a mouse? About this big? Well-groomed whiskers? Shh. Squick! Boy, I thought you were in trouble. - Squick? - Yes, I got out. You doubted me? And I see you've learned from the master. - Nice trophies. - Stealing is bad. - Squick? - Don't pay attention to our lawyer. Otherwise, she might try to save you, too, and then you're in trouble. Well, if you would show us the way out, Miss, we'll sign your book of good deeds to verify that you saved us, and everyone will go about their own business. We'll go to the port, you'll continue to execute-- Excuse me, save people. Deal? You'll have to say please. What? Without me, you'll never get out of here. This prison is a maze. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, I know these tunnels like the back of my hand. I visited my father here for many years while he was a prisoner. We'll manage without you. Mm-hmm. Oh, well, good luck. Okay. What? I was a bit rude earlier, but that's no reason for such an adorable mouse to suffer in this horrible dungeon. Hmm. Please help us get out of this place. Seriously? Molly muffin! Shh. Well, you're free. You can say thank you. Please and thank you in one night? Hmm. I know, I know. ♪ I'm stuck in prison ♪ ♪ De na na na ♪ ♪ I'm having fun ♪ ♪ De na na na na ♪ ♪ But I might have pea soup ♪ ♪ De na na na ♪ ♪ And my plight has begun ♪ ♪ De na na na ♪ Um, Your Majesty? What are you doing there? Whatever do you mean? I'm a prisoner. Just look at my apartment. This is my bedroom. - It's also a cloakroom-- - I'm sorry, but where's the real prisoner? He took the keys and left. He took the keys and left! I want that impostor found! This is outrageous. He dared to deceive the whole of Lilliput. Moreover, he dared to deceive me! Announce a reward for any information about the whereabouts of the fugitive. That will make things more difficult. Don't worry about us. Squick and I, we're going to the port. We have a ship there. All the best to you. - Come on, pal. - Sure, leave. That's what you're good at anyway. What? I hope your legs move as fast as your mouth. What? Why? Because we have to run! Hey, you two! Stop! That way. Come on! They must have gone that way. - Do you see him? - I think I see him. It seems quiet. Hmm. - Whew. - What a brave giant, hiding behind himself. Who's hiding? Me? I'm not afraid of them. - We got you now! - There he is. That way! Behind you! Follow me. Come on! - Excuse us. - Excuse us. Shh. - Shh. - Oh. - Hey, there they are! - Come on! I can't swim. Stay at your posts. Watch the tree line. If you see any movement, you report it. Well? What now? You know, I think I'll stay awhile. I have some unfinished business here. Some business, huh? Maybe it has something to do with your friend, Frelok? How do you know about Frelok? Well, I mean, it's just, everyone knows the stories. Now come on, let's go, I'll take you to him. I have this strange feeling. I think I know this place! Why, yes! There's the river, there's a head-shaped rock, there's the road. Of course! This is the Royal Canyon. They say Gulliver loved to take walks here. Yes, but from what I remember, there was no forest here last time. Well, a lot of time has passed. It's no wonder. Only a year has passed, and there used to be cloudberry bushes here, too. Oh man. There was this one night, when Frelok and I had too many cloudberries. And you know what that does to your stomach. And there's no restrooms nearby. And this forest is not known for its soft leaves, let me tell you. Gulliver, I really like you better when you're not talking. Oh, but it's such a good story! - Not interested. - Are you sure? No thanks, I'm good. Hm. Okay. I think we can spend the night here. We should split up and look for brushwood. It should be dry, because wet brushwood produces a lot of smoke. You don't seem to mind when it's coming out of your mouth. Ha ha, very funny. I'm just concerned about the guards seeing it. I don't know. You may want to be back in that warm prison cell after the frost and snow arrive. Frost and snow? In summer? Don't be ridiculous. I warned you, everything has changed here. Yes! Everything has changed here indeed. Lilliputian girls used to know their seasons. Yep! "Lilliputian girls used to know their seasons!" Oh! Jerk! Why did I think this was a good idea? This is what you get, Marcy, for believing fairy tales. We'll just go see Frelok and figure out a way to get him on his little boat. "I like you better when you're not talking!" What is her problem? This island is not anything like it used to be. Why did I even come back? I'll just go see Frelok. He'll help me get my ship back. Then I can get back out on the sea, and far from this crazy place. What a beautiful evening. - Marcy, I'd like-- - Silence? Did you know that in the land of Houyhnhnms, it is forbidden to build bonfires? How could I, an ignorant Lilliput girl, possibly know that? Marcy. I had a hard day today. I was imprisoned, I almost got killed a couple of times, then the whole of Lilliput chased me. I know that doesn't excuse my behavior. I just want to just say, thank you for saving my life and I'm sorry for being difficult. Peace? Okay. I wasn't at my best either. Peace. So, where did you say bonfires are forbidden? In the land of Houyhnhnms, bonfires are forbidden because it's disrespectful to the trees. Disrespectful to the trees? Yes. Houyhnhnms are terribly respectful of all life. Can you imagine their shock if I sailed to them on a ship made entirely of wood? Yes. What an interesting people. Oh, they aren't people. Then what are they? Houyhnhnms are horses. That's right. It's this amazing land ruled by horses. Noble and beautiful creatures. Gulliver, tell me how you got to Houyhnhnms country. I was returning home from the land of the giants. By the way, I felt like a Lilliputian there. Almost like you do now. Well, almost. Then a storm brought me to a beautiful island. This is where I saw these adorable horses. But having heard them speak, I thought I went nuts. Their trees speak there too? The trees sing there. Eventually, we made friends. With the trees? No, with the Houyhnhnms. So many thing wowed me in their culture. And we had a really good time together. That was the most interesting place I've ever visited. And you know what? We're still good friends to this day. Good friends. Hm. I knew I was a great storyteller. It's freezing cold out here! What's going on? How long have I slept? You slept for six months, and you snored from November to December. - Huh? - Everything is fine. You slept for seven or eight hours, not more. But how is this possible? Yesterday, it was summer, and today-- And today is winter! This is an ingenious invention of our king. It's called a yearday. He issued a decree that once a week, there's a day that's equal to one year in time. Yearday? Why would the king want to accelerate time? All for our hero and savior. For you. - Me? - When you left Lilliput, you promised to return in 40 years. But 40 years is a very long time, and the king didn't want to wait. 40 years? Well, yes, I think I remember blurting something out. But it was a joke. I just waved my hand and said, "See you in 40 years." Everyone laughed. But that doesn't explain how summer can turn into winter overnight. Our king came up with the idea that if once a week, during the course of one day, summer, winter, fall and spring pass together, time can be accelerated. So, he decreed it be so. A decree? How can the king change nature and the course of time with some ridiculous decree? ♪ Yes, I know that it must sound a bit concerning ♪ ♪ Difficult to grasp and to explain ♪ ♪ See, we waited so much time for your returning ♪ ♪ Everybody went a little bit insane ♪ ♪ Right, the king decided to make time move faster ♪ ♪ Had all the celestial bodies realigned ♪ ♪ Was it a success or was it a disaster? ♪ ♪ Waiting made the country lose its mind ♪ ♪ Yearlike day, daylike year ♪ ♪ Wanting you to get back here ♪ ♪ It's night, it's day, it's spring, it's fall ♪ ♪ It isn't making any sense at all ♪ ♪ Daylike year, yearlike day ♪ ♪ So long since you went away ♪ ♪ The king can make a month an hour ♪ ♪ Has he gone a little mad with power? ♪ ♪ How ♪ ♪ Worried little birdies fly around and wonder ♪ ♪ Why they have to migrate every night ♪ ♪ Now that is when the spell we're under ♪ ♪ Needs someone like you to set it right ♪ ♪ Yearlike day, daylike year ♪ ♪ Wanting you to get back here ♪ ♪ It's day, it's night, it's fall, it's spring ♪ ♪ And I can't make sense of anything ♪ ♪ Daylike year, yearlike day ♪ ♪ So long since you went away ♪ ♪ The king can make a week a minute ♪ ♪ Crazy fairy tale and now you're in it ♪ ♪ How ♪ As you can see, even nature here obeys decrees. All of those yeardays accelerated time, and here you are, after 40 years. I didn't come back here because of some crazy prophecy. I came back because I received a letter from my old friend Frelok. Hmm. Well, then you shouldn't keep your friend waiting. Okay, time to go. Squick, get up. What if Frelok has sweets? Sweets! Well, here we are. Great. I can't wait to see my old friend. Whoa! Whoa! - Squick! - Aw, Anchor! Boy, you recognized me! You still remember me, you good dog! Where's your master, huh? This is my lawyer and my friend, Marcy. Be careful, she bites. Look at him go. I wish I had your confidence. And this is Squick. Squick, this is Anchor. Squick. Hello, sir, I'm here to see Frelok. Would you happen to know where he is? It can't be! Frelok? Is that you? But we're the same age. Not anymore. Frelok, old friend. It's me, Gulliver! Stop shouting, I'm not deaf yet. Marcy, daughter, why did you bring this impostor to my house? Daughter? Huh, it seems many things have changed here indeed. Frelok, buddy! Don't you recognize me? I don't know you, and I don't want to know you! Go away! It's okay, Father. He's a friend. Let's go inside the house. Come along, Father, I'll make you some tea. How can he believe that I'm a giant? He knew me. We fought together, side by side! I've already told you. The guards came, they announced you are the Man Mountain, showed a decree with the king's signature and seal. How could he believe that? Everyone believed it. And I'm just like everyone. You are not just like everyone! Remember, on the Blefuscu flagship, when we snuck aboard that night and tossed the guards overboard? Were you like everyone then? Everyone else stayed on shore, and you took a bullet for me. We got the job done-- - Hey! - ...and had each other's backs. We didn't need decrees or seals. No! It's forbidden to speak about that! I will hear no more of this! - But Frelok! - That's enough, Gulliver! He was the only one who told the truth! Everyone laughed at him! He was persecuted, beaten, and spit on, but he never betrayed you! He kept saying, "My friend, Gulliver, will return and everything will be all right." But then they started picking on me, and only then did he agree that you were a giant. He did it for me. He protected me. I thought a hero would come who would save us all, but instead I got a selfish jerk who only thinks of himself! You're no hero! Everyone wanted a giant, but instead, we got a man who's smaller than Squick! ♪ Where we belong, shoulder to shoulder ♪ ♪ Righting the wrong, standing fast and tall ♪ ♪ Wild as a hurricane, free as a star ♪ ♪ Quailing at nothing, we know what we are ♪ ♪ Linked as the strongest chain, sure as a spar ♪ ♪ When we're together, we know... ♪ ♪ What we are ♪ It can't be!

Father, what have you done?! It wasn't me! It was... Get them! Oh. Oh my God. Marcy, Gulliver! What have I done? Today, at noon, this square will witness the execution of the false Gulliver! The impostor will be beheaded! The executioner will personally decapitate those responsible for the existence and support of the pseudo-giant! Today at noon this square will-- Yes, yes, very well stated. No need to repeat it. Your voice carries quite well. Yes, well, citizens of Lilliput, we shall begin! A word from our beloved king! Dear residents of Lilliput, I, your favorite king, proudly present to you today - the execution of prisoners-- - Don't blame Father. He didn't know what he was doing. Come on, I would never blame him. Frelok is my best friend. He saved my life once. Stop talking, you're interrupting me. Sorry, Your Majesty. May I be granted a last request? Well, I am a fair king. What is your request? Could you shut up for a minute? I need to talk to my friend. Did you hear that? Oh yeah? Executioner, proceed with the execution! I don't get it. I can't see anything. What kind of nonsense is this? Who cut the peep holes? Hm? Oh, yes, I did. Okay, it's fine. I'll manage. Oh. Hmm? Marcy, I wanted to tell you something... So? Did I get it? Almost. A little to the left. Oh. To be more precise, I wanted to ask you something. - And now? - More to the left. Ask away. Well? Take a few steps back. Marcy, tell me, was it Frelok who wrote me the letter, or was it you? Forgive me, please, if you can. No, no. You don't have to apologize. I don't regret coming back, because if I hadn't, we may never have met. And now? Did I get it? Just a little bit further back. Marcy, If this is our last moment alive, I need to tell you, I have never met a girl like you before. So while I still have a chance, I want to tell you that I-- What about now? Did I finally hit it? To the right a little! Stop interrupting us! Fine! Do I hear laughter? Laughter? At me? Ambassadors? Tell them I'm busy! Okay, I'll be right back. It'll be quick. We're not really in a hurry. Have a nice talk! Gentlemen, honorary plenipotentiary envoys of Lilliput's sworn enemy Blefuscu, bow to his unsurpassed majesty the King of Lilliput! Thank you. Thank you, herald. You are very kind. Well, where are your bows? Well, you two are not very kind. On the contrary, dear king. We are very kind. Indeed? Wonderful! We kindly allow you to surrender. If you have a head on your shoulders, you will give up your tiny country of Lilliput to our glorious leader, Generalissimo Bellicosso Blefuscu! What? Did I hear right? Give up? Guards! Grab these two insolents and throw them in jail. We have a massive army, and it's already at your borders! Oh, really? You can't scare me! I have something even better than your army! What is it? - I have-- - What? - Well, it's-- - Yes? -It's a--I have-- - What? - A giant! Yes, a giant, I have one. Yes, I have the giant. But according to our data, there are no giants. Well, he's just arrived. - May I see him? - He's resting. Tired from the road. He is, you know, still a man, albeit a giant. Pass it on! The giant is back and he will crush your entire army! Your Generalissimo and the two of you, oh, oh, this will be my personal request, will be the first to go! - Tell me. - Of course. Ask what you want. Maybe another dessert, huh? Uh, ugh. So why have you brought me here? Why the royal treatment? No pun intended. So witty. Why would I need a reason to feed my prisoner? So, you just want to feed me properly before the execution? Gulliver, you're so funny. Okay, fine. I need a little favor. You must help me defeat the Blefuscu army. Hm. Interesting. So you, Your Majesty, are asking me for help? Can't you handle this on your own? Well, I'll try to explain it to you. Or you could try on the role of a soldier, and defeat their army yourself! Amusing. But the role of soldier is not fit for a king such as myself. Well, let's say I agree. What's in it for me? - Anything you want. - Anything anything? Well, not anything anything, but just about anything you want. Ah, well, then. I'd like you to release my friends, and then you pay me, - you pay me-- - How much? Eh, how many Blefuscians are there? Oh, many thousands. Many thousands? So that number, are you certain about that? I mean, maybe you made a mistake? I am King! I do not make mistakes! Maybe some of them called in sick? Maybe some are on vacation? I don't know. Some could've went to visit their moms? We need to clarify that. You recheck everything, calculate the numbers more precisely, and then report back to me. - Meanwhile I-- - Go ahead, abandon your friends. I do love a nice execution. No. Look, I want to help, but one man against thousands? - It's impossible. - It's not that difficult. If Blefuscu sees that the giant has returned and is ready to fight his army, then they will simply run away in fear, and Lilliput will be saved. It's brilliant. So, what do you say? Oh yeah, brilliant! So did he come back, this giant? The giant is you! There is one little thing, a minor detail, really. I am not a giant and you were the first to say so. Trust this minor detail to me. I'll arrange everything. How? I am the king, and the king knows what he is doing! I will issue a royal decree stating that you, Gulliver, are a giant, a Man-Mountain, a blah-blah-blah, and the people will believe it! You think? I am the king, and the king does not think. I noticed that right away. I mean, I know! You've seen that in Lilliput, even nature obeys the king's orders! - Yes, I saw your yearday-- - Enough! Play your part, and I will pardon you all. Deal? Okay, deal. But I have one more small request. Here we are. Oh, watch your feet. Careful. Oh, oopsie. Mouse, come out. Is this right, Mr. Gulliver? Right you are. Squick. And what about the girl? Do we release her? Oh, I don't know. We can keep her here. It's no problem. Squick? But maybe we should release her. I mean, whatever would she do without you? Well, if you think so. I do, and therefore all of Lilliput would agree. Okay, if you say so. Like you said, what would she do without me? Remember this day. After all, today you have been released by the great, the unsurpassed, the handsome, some would even say beautiful and who am I to argue, whose name is-- Get over here so I can strangle you. Ah, how quaint, the two of them. Hear ye, hear ye! According to royal decree, the Gulliver who recently arrived by boat is none other than the legendary Man-Mountain! It happened! The real Gulliver is back! The giant is in the city! He's going to the square! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! Gulliver! - Gulliver! - Huh? - Hello, buddy! - Frelok! Buddy! Sorry for betraying you, my friend. I didn't understand what I was doing. There's nothing to forgive you for. Forget it. I'm just happy you're back! What is the matter, citizens? Disorderly conduct? Do I need to put on my city guard outfit? What? We wanna see the giant. The giant? Have a look. Here he is, our Giant. Uh, yes, I am the giant. Well, then, I'm a giant, too. What exactly is wrong with this giant? We just want to make sure that he is a real giant! Our giant would fulfill the prophecies! Very true. But we don't have to rush. Okay, let's hear your prophecies. I'll see what I can do. Well, for starters, Gulliver must repair our water supply system. Yes, and Gulliver was supposed to repair the city walls. Right! Like the man says. I am a woman! That's what I said, ma'am. Rebuild the wall, do the plumbing, and then the people and I will believe that you are a giant. Yeah, buddy, actions speak louder than words. All right! I'll do it! Yes, huzzah! I did it! We'll do it together! We all agree? Ooh! Please, someone help me get off. Oh! Yeah! People of Lilliput, the city walls have been repaired! Are you ready to fix the water supply? Okay, here we go. Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo! You expected giant feats. Any success that I have achieved is because of your help and support, and for that I am grateful! Gulliver! I would like to tell all of you what it means to be a giant. A man becomes a giant not just because he has big hands and feet or a frightening voice. His deeds, his faith in himself make him a giant. And all of you, every one, can do great things. Can I be a giant, too? If you believe in yourself, you will definitely become one. Did you see that? Yes, I saw it. We must inform the Generalissimo at once. Delays, delays, delays! My army ready to move right now. Where are those Peters? We are here, my Generalissimo! So, has that worthless King of Lilliput surrendered? No, my Generalissimo, he refused! Fine! I really hoped he would refuse. My army has thousands of soldiers and the Clodhopper! Besides, what is the point of having a large army if you can't crush your enemies? My Generalissimo, there is one small problem. - Problem? - Yes, my Generalissimo. The King of Lilliput announced the return of the giant Gulliver. And he will fight on the side of the Lilliputians. What? You said he was an impostor, not a giant! Sorry. We must have not seen him right the first time. Maybe the giant was sitting down. Should we delay our attack? What? And delay my triumph? Because of some puny giant? Never! This will be an even greater victory. Nothing will stop us, giant or no giant. We will crush the hated land of Lilliput! Besides, I thought such a thing might happen, and so prepared a surprise for this giant, Gulliver. Daddy, can I be a giant too? Sure! If you just believe in yourself. Very funny. Someday, you too can be just like the amazing Gulliver. You really think so? He said so himself. Okay, I may have went a little overboard. Can you forgive me please? I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I couldn't have done all of this without both of you, so thanks. Hmm, thank you and please in one day? Hmm. Did I ever tell you about the time I visited Treasure Island? Pretty impressive how well things worked out, huh? Definitely. It's been a pretty crazy experience. At first, I regretted coming back, but I'm glad I did. I'm glad you sent that letter. You're glad I tricked you into coming back? Well, if it weren't for that letter, I would never have known that my friend had such an amazing and lovely daughter. That's very sweet of you. I'm sure you say that to all your friends' daughters. No, of course not. I mean, Squick and I both agree that you are our favorite Lilliputian girl who confuses her seasons. Is that right? - Oh, yes. - Lucky me. Marcy? I wanna tell you... I'm not very good at this stuff, but I... Hey! Watch where you're going! What's going on?! Blefuscu's Army is at the city walls. - What? - That's impossible! That fast? Where are you going? The city walls are that way. I know! Stop! Your duty is to protect the city! Get back to your posts. Today we fight for Lilliput! Not me! King coming through! King! King here! Move it or lose it, buddy! Gulliver, Marcy. Your Majesty, where are you going? The Blefuscu Army is at the city walls! You are the king! And you are the giant. You fight them. I have more important public affairs to deal with! But tell me how it all ends. - Out of the way! - Make way for the King! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Take that, Blefuscu! Ha! Gulliver! I'm ready to fight! You sure are. Get the kids to safety. Come on, Wesley. But I want to fight with Gulliver! Gulliver! How many are there? Come. Take a look. There are at least 10,000 in formation, and more still arriving. What do we do? Half of the city has left. We're outnumbered and poorly armed. We can't fight an army that size. Are you suggesting that we abandon Lilliput? I don't want to but I don't see any other option. These people stayed to defend their city. We both know it's too late to evacuate. I know the odds are against us. but we have fought impossible battles before. I know. But this time we don't have a battle plan or the element of surprise. ♪ Linked as the strongest chain, sure as the spar ♪ ♪ When we're together, we know what we are ♪ All right, but if we're gonna do this, we need to come up with a plan. Just like the good old days. Only this time, we'll have to use our heads instead of our swords. Hold on, I've got a crazy idea. Listen up. Greetings, invaders. The magnificent and mighty giant, Gulliver, wishes to speak with Generalissimo of the Blefuscu Army. Why should I talk with this Gulliver? There are rumors that he is an impostor! Generalissimo, the renowned giant, Gulliver, has a proposal that will spare the lives of your soldiers. He wishes to meet and discuss this with you. We will understand if you have heard of his prowess and are afraid to meet him in person. I fear no man, especially not this fictitious giant of yours. Send him out to the battlefield and I will meet him face to face. Huh, very good. He will join you soon. Well, my friend, it's up to you to sell it. Be careful. Hello, general. Here I am, Gulliver, the renowned giant. Just as I suspected. You are a fraud! But we saw it with our own eyes! Yes. He raises walls and destroys mountains with his magic. Your spies have been paying attention. Simple minds will accept anything. I don't believe children's fairy tales. I believe my own eyes. Don't let my current size mislead you. Take a look around. There are legends, murals and a large gate constructed specifically for me. General, you seem to be an intelligent man. That is obvious. And I am sure you are aware of the noble tradition of combat by champion. I challenge you, as champion of your army, to a duel. - What? - You and me, one on one. The winner is the victor of the battle. I know what combat by champion is, you ninny! And why would I agree to this madness? I have a whole army behind me! If I were an ordinary man, that would make no sense. But I'm Gulliver, the legendary Man Mountain. If you were to defeat me in a duel, you would be hailed as the champion who single-handedly defeated the giant, and conquered Lilliput. Hmm. The champion who defeated the giant Gulliver. You are beginning to look like a giant after all. But as a condition of this duel, I ask you, upon my defeat, accept the city's surrender, don't level it to the ground, and don't harm the citizens. And, of course, in the unlikely event of my victory, you agree to withdraw this fine army. Fair enough. Compared to the glory I shall attain, I am willing to concede these terms. All right, I agree to defeat you in a personal duel. So be it. Listen up, men! I will fight the giant of Lilliput single-handedly for the glory of Blefuscu! Well, Gulliver, are you ready for death? Hm.

Who could defeat Gulliver the great, the unsurpassed, the handsome, some would say beautiful and who am I to argue-- What? Say hello to the Clodhopper! Seriously? No! Yearday! Ooh, mm-hmm. Gulliver, look! Yearday! Huh? Hmm? That's enough! You have defied me, and dishonored the battlefield! I, Gulliver the great, will unleash my full power upon you! Your treachery will not be tolerated! Let fire rain down from the clouds! Where are you going, cowards? And now you shall face the bitter cold of winter! Ya-hoo! Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Ooh. He saved us! What the heck? We did it! I, the King of Lilliput, as promised, kept my word. And we, along with Gulliver, defeated and smashed the evil Generalissimo! - Hurray! - And how do you, Your Majesty, manage to be in two places at once? Hiding in the bushes yet still able to smash Blefuscu? Laughter? I am your king! Not anymore! Gulliver, the people of Lilliput deserve a better leader. Would you do us the honor? Your confidence in me is appreciated. However, I believe we have a better man for this job. Frelok. - Me? - You have been here fighting against the lies all of these years. It's time an honorable man serves the good people of Lilliput. Well? What say you? Hear, hear! Long live the king! - Well, King Frelok. - Hooray! Yay! Good people, today is a day of victory for all of Lilliput! Let us celebrate the defeat of Generalissimo and enjoy long lasting peace! At last! I guess this means you're a princess now. ...need not fear. Enjoy your life. Finally, we are at peace. Marcy, do you really need all of this for our journey? Of course! Your princess deserves every comfort. Where are your things, honey? I'm wearing them. I'm curious. And they still made it taller! These Lilliputians are incorrigible! Almost! Good morning, Gulliver! Were you planning on telling the king where you are headed? Well, buddy, I mean, Your Greatness, Majesty-- Buddy is fine. Well buddy, wherever the winds take us. Ocean waves, wind in the sail, new lands, my beloved at my side! Now that's the life! You will come back to visit, right? Of course! In 40 years. - Huh? - Uh. Just kidding. We'll be back soon. How could we stay away from Lilliput for long? This is our home. Besides We have to put that enormous city gate to use. That reminds me. I have one request for the King. Your Majesty, can you please get rid of that stupid yearday decree? I think I can do that. And you, be good to my daughter. Of course. I promise to teach her all about the seasons before we return. Ouch! And I promise to teach him how to treat a lady. Love you, sweetie! He's learning. Bye, Father. Goodbye, precious daughter. Come back soon. Squick! Bye, Lilliput! See you soon! Fine. Go! So was Gulliver ever really a giant? Only in the fairy tales, lad. You see, his deeds made him larger than life. It doesn't take a big person to be a giant, just a person with a big heart and the courage to see things through to the end. Hey! Here you go, Fin. Wait your turn, Gil. This is for Karl. Here you go, Karl. What a good boy you are. Okay, now it's your turn, Gil. Oh, I didn't forget about you, Bubbles. Huh.
