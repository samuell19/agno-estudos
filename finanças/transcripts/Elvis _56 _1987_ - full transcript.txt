"That's All Right, Mama" and "Mystery Train"... are starting to get play on Southern radio stations, and Elvis becomes a regular on the Louisiana Hayride radio program. Out on the road, playing small-change clubs, Elvis dreams of becoming a big star. The dream seems far-fetched, except for one thing: The girls who scream at the way he moves when he sings. [ Audience Screaming ] ♪ We gonna rock ♪ ♪ Let's rock ♪ None of these facts are lost on Colonel Tom Parker, waiting in the wings, watching. ♪ All our blues away ♪ Now, Parker isn't a real military colonel. He's one of those honorary Southern ones... An ex-carnival huckster who grew up in the world of the fast buck. Parker recognizes a gold mine when he sees it, and offers Elvis a personal management contract. He tells Elvis, "Son, right now you have a million dollars' worth of talent. By the time we're through, you'll have a million dollars." Because Elvis isn't yet 21, he needs the approval of his parents to sign the contract. Elvis's mother, Gladys, is a very protective woman who distrusts the colonel... and advises her son not to sign. But Elvis and his father, Vernon, go for it hook, line and sinker, and Elvis begins a lifelong partnership with the colonel. Colonel Parker begins shopping Elvis to the big record companies. And by November 1955, RCA buys Presley's contract from Sam Phillips for $40,000... The largest sum ever paid for a country singer. On January 8, 1956, Elvis celebrates his 21st birthday.

And it isn't just the music. It's the clothes, the sideburns and ducktail. He doesn't just look different. He looks dangerous. The 1950s Eisenhower era was a time of conformity in American life: Ranch houses, backyard barbecues. And Elvis? Nobody knew what to make of him at first.

That's all. [ Narrator ] What makes Elvis so threatening... is his choice of black rhythm and blues music. Thank you very much. America is still a segregated nation in 1956... in everything from water fountains to education. Racial tensions are beginning to spark civil rights protests... and to make way for a Baptist minister, Dr. Martin Luther King. Elvis is a Southern boy who just soaked up the musical influences of his youth... Black and white, country and western, pop and gospel... Mixed 'em all together, made up his own brand of rock and roll. By performing songs like Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" on national television, Elvis crosses the racial barrier in music... and kicks down the door for scores of artists to follow... black and white. ♪ A whop bop a loo ma Ba lop bam boom ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ A whop bop a loo ma Ba lop bam boom ♪ ♪ Got a gal named Sue ♪ ♪ She know just what to do ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Sue ♪ ♪ She know just what to do ♪ ♪ She knows how to love me Yes, indeed ♪ ♪ Boy, you don't know what you do to me ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ A whop bop a loo ma Ba lop bam boom ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Daisy ♪ ♪ She almost drive me crazy ♪ ♪ I got a gal named Daisy ♪ ♪ She almost drive me crazy ♪ ♪ She know how to love me Yes, indeed ♪ ♪ Boy, you don't know what you do to me ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy ♪ ♪ A whop bop a loo ma Ba lop bam boom ♪ Hey, boy.

People want to know who he is, what he thinks. [ Elvis ] In a lot of the mail I get, people ask questions about the kind of things I do and all that sort of stuff. Well, I-I don't smoke and I don't drink and I love to go to movies. Maybe someday I'm gonna have a home and a family of my own, and I'm not gonna budge from it. I-I was an only child, but... maybe my kids won't be. I suppose this kind of talk raises another question: Am I in love? No. [ Chuckles ] I've thought I've been in love, but I guess I wasn't. It just passed over. I guess I haven't met the girl yet, but I will, and I hope I won't be too long, 'cause I get lonesome sometimes. I get lonesome right in the middle of a crowd. I've got a feeling that... That, with her, whoever she may be, I won't be lonesome, no matter where I am. ♪♪ [ Movie Fanfare ] [ Narrator ] Hollywood is the flip side of Elvis's dream. Ever since his days as a 15-year-old usher... at the Loew's State Theatre in Memphis, he watches screen idols like Robert Mitchum and Tony Curtis... and fantasizes about being a movie star. More than anything, Elvis wants to be a serious actor like the late James Dean. He worships the star, who tragically died in a car crash just four months earlier. He sees Rebel Without a Cause no less than a dozen times... and memorizes every one of Dean's lines. On April 1, Elvis does a screen test for producer Hal Wallis. He's given a scene from The Rainmaker, an upcoming Burt Lancaster- Katharine Hepburn movie. Wallis likes what he sees, and on April 7, Elvis signs a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. [ Elvis ] It's a dream come true, you know? I've had people ask me was I gonna sing in the movies. I'm-I'm not. I mean, not as... As far as I know, 'cause I-I took a... an acting test, and I wouldn't... Actually, I wouldn't care too much about singing in the movies. [ Narrator ] Paramount does offer him a part in The Rainmaker. But under advice from the colonel, he turns it down. Instead, Wallis loans Elvis out to another studio... for a Debra Paget-Richard Egan Western called The Reno Brothers. Shooting will begin in August. With television deals and movie contracts in his hip pocket, the colonel moves on to Las Vegas. On April 23, Elvis appears in Las Vegas for the first time. The colonel promotes him as "The Atomic-Powered Singer." And he bombs. Elvis opens at the Venus Room... of the New Frontier Hotel... on the same bill... as Freddy Martin and his orchestra... and comedian Shecky Greene.

They have a director and a producer, and just, uh, as far as the acting and all, you're on your own. I might accomplish something at it through the years. Cathy? What you doing? Is something wrong? No. No, Clint. Nothing. I was... Cathy, you're crying. What are you crying about? I-I don't know, Clint. I had a bad dream, I guess. The war and everything. Oh, don't cry. We're all safe again. There's nothing to worry about anymore. I hope not. [ Narrator ] He's surprised to find... that Paramount has slipped four songs into the movie. Hal Wallis decides he doesn't want a bunch of hillbillies out of Nashville... playing on his soundtrack... and tells Elvis he can't use Scotty, Bill and D.J. to record the songs.

At the end of 1956, the two top-grossing films in the nation... are Giant, starring James Dean, and Love Me Tender, starring Elvis Presley. Elvis appeared for the last time on The Ed Sullivan Show... January 6, 1957, almost one year to the day... since a 21-year-old Elvis Presley... first entered the RCA studio to cut "Heartbreak Hotel." By now, his hair is dyed jet-black... because he believes it'll photograph better for the movies, and he thinks it makes him look a little like Tony Curtis. ♪ You know I can be found ♪ ♪ Sitting home all alone ♪ ♪ If you can't come around ♪ ♪ At least please telephone ♪ ♪ Don't be cruel ♪ ♪ To a heart that's true ♪ Sullivan makes one last desperate attempt to censor Elvis... by photographing him only from the waist up. ♪ Then you'll know you'll have me ♪ ♪ And I'll know I'll have you too ♪ ♪ Don't be cruel ♪ ♪ To a heart that's true ♪ ♪ I don't want no other love ♪ ♪ Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of ♪ ♪ Don't be cruel ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ To a heart that's true ♪ ♪ Don't be cruel ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ To a heart that's true ♪ Here we go. ♪ Well, I don't want no other love ♪ [ Crowd Screams ] ♪ Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of ♪♪ [ Crowd Screaming ] For his final song on the show, Elvis performs the gospel classic "Peace in the Valley." ♪ Oh, well, I'm tired and so weary ♪ ♪♪ [ Vocalizing ] ♪ But I must go alone ♪ ♪ Till the Lord comes and calls ♪ ♪ Calls me away ♪ ♪ Oh, yes ♪ ♪ Well, the morning's so bright ♪ ♪ And the lamp is alight ♪ ♪ And the night Night is as black ♪ ♪ As the sea ♪ ♪ Oh, yes ♪ ♪ There will be peace ♪ ♪ In the valley ♪ ♪ For me someday ♪ ♪ There will be peace in the valley ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ Oh, Lord, I pray ♪ ♪ There'll be no sadness ♪ ♪ No sorrow ♪ ♪ No trouble Trouble I see ♪ ♪ There will be peace in the valley ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ For me ♪♪ It's the end of an era.

In 1957, his concerts are so big and unmanageable... that Elvis stops touring. The original band of Scotty, Bill and D.J. break up. Elvis moves to the privacy of Graceland with his family. And right at the very peak of his success, his beloved mother passes away. ♪ I'll be sad and blue Crying over you ♪ He goes on to make a total of 33 films... and becomes the highest paid star in Hollywood.
