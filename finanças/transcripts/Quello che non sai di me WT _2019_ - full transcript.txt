WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME Rosarno, Italy - Morning. - Good luck. Italy-Switzerland border Bellinzona, Switzerland Quiet or we'll wake the girls. - What are you talking about ? - I have two daughters. Are you fucking kidding ? You should've told me ! Who do you think you are ? Hi. Let me see. - You need stitches. - Let's go to the hospital then. Here we are. I sleep here. This is your mattress. TV's over there. We've got it all. Want a beer ? Remember, I told you about him. Hi. Grab the strings, don't touch the cell. Careful. It'll break if you even look at it. Try it. - How much does he pay ? - 100 francs. 90 euros. It's not much money, life is expensive here. It's a lot for Africa but not for here. Let's go. You can easily make 200 francs here. First I make sure there's a vibe. Then I just get straight to it: "You want sex and love. I want money to live. Let's make a deal. You get what you want, I get what I want." Come ! Come on, come with me ! Come with me ! Come ! Can I have your number ? Sure. Hello, Paolo ? Oh, sorry. Dickhead, he gave me the wrong number. At least he didn't hit you. Come on, mom. Don't be sad. - All set. - Thanks. Hi. I just had my stitches removed, look. Great, it looks good. I don't know what to do with Alina, she keeps mouthing off to me. - Teens do that. - No, she hates me. I don't have time to talk about this now. You could talk to her, too. Paying alimony isn't enough. I can't fucking do everything. Keep it down, please. It's not my fault Alina is mouthing off. In any case, I have a patient to see. - Hello. - Hi. I remember you. You were in the club with a bandage on your eye. Yes. He's looking for a 100-franc bike. The cheapest is 170, over there. Can't you go lower than 160 ? - No. - Please ! - Thanks. - Have a good day. - Wow, feels like I'm flying. - I can give you 10% off. I'll take it. Can two ride it ? - Two people ? - Yes. Then hop on, come on. Just to test it out. A quick test. What are you doing ? - Let's go to New York. - Brake ! Where are the brakes ? Wait... That's a good one. Get down ? Patricia, my friend... Nice to meet you, Alex. Hello. We have a visitor. I met Ikendu. - Coffee ? - Yes. What's your name again ? Ikendu. What kind of name is that ? Ike means "power", ndu means "life". Interesting. We have to go, come on. - Bye. - See you tonight. See the little one ? Her father's Algerian. A handsome man but a louse. - Why a louse ? - He cheated and doesn't pay a cent. I have no idea where he is. I've got great luck when it comes to men... Have you applied for asylum ? No. You have to tell them a bunch of stories to get political asylum. - I don't want to do that. - Will you tell me your stories ? I worked in Libya for a year to pay for the trip... across the ocean. It was rough. In Italy I worked with my friend Alex in the fields. They paid peanuts. Et voilà, here I am. You're handsome. You look like a prince. I want to make some money then go to France. My uncle lives in Paris. - But I need money first. - I'm not looking to get serious. Huh ? I don't want a relationship. I don't want a relationship either. - Here. - Thanks. Here. Oh, Alina ! A toast ! To the bride and groom ! This is all so beautiful. What we have. Yes, it's beautiful. - For me ? - Yes. Five. "You're pretty". Thanks, thanks ! - Hi, Enrico. - Hello ! - Remember me ? - Yes. I'm Jana. Hello. You have a lovely family. Thanks. Patricia, my daughter... No, no ! Having fun, ma'am ? - What ? I don't understand. - He asked if you're happy. Happy... yes, thanks. I'm happy. You... you are very nice. Mom, let's dance. Hold on. You're as crazy as always ! My head's spinning. Do you like Ikendu ? Yes, he's too good for you. And I'm too good for him. We're a perfect couple. Maybe. - Where are you going ? - I'm leaving. I don't feel so great today. Come on ! - It's early. - Look. My request for asylum was denied. Shit ! Bastards. You're lucky. Thanks to her you'll get a permit. Look... look what it says. Stay here with me, bro. We'll find a way. Everything will be fine. - I'm only staying for you. - I know, come on. Let's go dance. Five. And seven. But first, I'll take your deck. Hi. How's it going ? No, thanks, the sauce is too greasy. Want to hear an African story ? There was a woman who was fat... really chubby. She goes to the doctor and asks for a cure to lose weight. The doctor says: "Come back tomorrow after I consult the spirits." She goes back the next day and the doctor says: "Sorry, there's no cure for you, because you'll be dead in 10 days." So she goes home. Sad, so very sad... She stops eating and sleeping. Day 10 comes around and she doesn't die. So she goes back to the doctor and says: "Doc, you were wrong, I didn't die." He looks at her... and says: "The cure worked." Hi. How many panels are there ? 67. I'll write 20 as usual, okay ? Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four... Slowly. Six, seven... Yes. Let me wash my hands. I was worried. I kept calling you but you never answered. I was with Paul, we were working, That's no reason to not answer. You don't know how hard it is for me to be without you. In Calabria I had an Italian woman, she'd call me and say: "Where are you ? Why haven't you called me ?" - I didn't like that. - Don't blame me for her. I don't want to control you. I just wanted to hear your voice and know you were okay. If I'm here then I'm okay. But next time, answer at least one call. Promise ? Next time wait till I call you. Promise ? - Here. - For me ? Thanks. For you. It's a mix of music: African and American... - Hope you like it. - Thanks. How's life ? So so. Come on, I'll show you how to dance. Thanks. Have a good day. Ikendu ! Hello. Good morning. What's your name again ? Gina. Bye. Who's that ? I met her at the club where I first saw you with that bandage on. - You slept with her ? - We danced. Is sincerity important for you in a relationship ? Not knowing everything is better. What don't you want to know about me ? Well ? Look over here. Now that Kelly is here, Paul doesn't want to go to Salerno. I'll go alone. What if I come with you ? Come on, we never had a honeymoon ! I'll take a few days off. Hi, how many panels ? 80. What happened ? Where have you been ? There was an accident and a traffic jam. You could've called me. - Sorry. - I've been waiting for four hours. Let's go eat, come on. It's good. Let's have a baby. Huh ? You heard me. At my age ? You're crazy. I'm happy to see you. - How's it going ? - It's going... It was better here. Yeah... Hold this. See you later. Kelly's sick, we're going to the hospital. Write. Boldrini. Via Giuseppe Motta 26. Boldrini. Alex is sick in the bathroom, he can't go. Go quickly, he's waiting. Hurry ! All right ? - Is that a new phone ? - No, it's a work phone. Can I ask you something ? Why don't you ever have money ? I know this is my family. But I have lots of problems to sort out. One day I'll give you the explanations you want. Do you have another woman in Africa ? I know for your people having two women is normal. There's no other woman, my heart is here. Freeze, police ! On the ground, hands up ! On the ground ! Hello ? Hold on. - Patricia, it's for you. - Who is it ? Hello ? Do it in here. We need to make sure you have no drugs in you. Find it. Well ? - I can't go. - Then we'll call a doctor. - He'll help you. - No ! Please, no. No doctor. - What's going on ? - I can't say. My daughter called me. What are you looking for ? We left the search warrant with your daughter. Your prince charming's a dealer. That's who you married ? A shithead ! Ikendu isn't a shithead. I won't allow you to say such hateful things about him. Alina, don't leave me on my own, please ! Hello. I'm Marco Russo, your attorney. I don't need an attorney, I've done nothing wrong. Mom, why won't you tell me what happened ? Some cops came by. But I don't know why. I don't know what they were looking for. Just be patient. Claudia ! In 72 hours the judge will adjudicate on your husband's arrest. I could've told you this on the phone, you didn't need to come. - What's the accusation ? - I can't tell you that. - Due to confidentiality. - He's my husband, I have a right ! Darmiel, come here. Good girl. Want some water ? You have to help me. - I want to see Ikendu. - Ma'am, that's impossible. Mr. Traoré can't receive visitors. I'm sorry. Fuck you ! I want to talk to the judge... who signed this paper. I won't leave until I get to talk to him. I can't call the judge. Then tell me where my husband is. At least tell me if he's in a cell alone or with others. If he's eating, if he's okay... I'm sorry. They wouldn't tell me anything at all. Can you believe this ? What do you know about him ? I know he loves me, he accepts me for who I am. With all of my faults. And I certainly have plenty... He doesn't talk much, but that's a cultural difference. It doesn't matter to me. I've never been as happy as I was with him. War in Mali 2012 Children haven't eaten in days. We're hungry, that's why we're leaving. What happened ? They arrested me. Why ? What did you do ? Nothing. I need to know what happened. Tell me everything, Ike, please. What's wrong ? That car is bothering me. Nneka ? - What are you doing here ? - Here, this is for you... and Kelly. How come you got out but Paul didn't ? - What did you tell the cops ? - Nothing. Paul is my brother, that's why I'm here. What did Nneka mean ? What did she think you told the cops ? I don't know. - I didn't do anything. - Then why are they following you ? Do you think I'm innocent or not ? I don't know, you won't tell me anything... I have nothing to do with drugs. If you think I'm involved with drugs, that really upsets me. All right. No matter what, I still love you. I didn't ask about your love, I asked if you think I'm innocent. You said it's the same, but it's not ! What I meant was I love you no matter what you did. So you're suspicious ? That's awful. Because nobody is telling me what happened. But if you say you're innocent, I believe you. No ! Morning. Come with us. - Why ? - Come get your cell phone. Get in, please. Mr. Traoré. Good morning. Have a seat, please. We're waiting for your attorney. Your friend Alex Baruba gave his statement yesterday. Now it's your turn. Why are you asking about my friend ? It's best you collaborate. I'm just here to get my cell phone. No. - Morning. - Good morning. You're here for something more serious. I just came to get my phone, you can't detain me now. This is a swindle. - Chief ! - Stop him ! Stop him ! MUNICIPAL JAIL Ma'am... on July 3, 2015 you went to Salerno with your husband, correct ? Yes. Where is my husband right now ? He's under arrest. We'll explain. Do you know why he went to Salerno ? You don't have to answer if you don't want to. He delivered solar panels to be shipped to Africa. Is that wrong ? These phone records show you called your husband in Salerno but he never replied. Is that correct ? Yes. - So what ? - Why didn't your husband answer ? Did you ask him ? According to statement from customs officers, your husband was stopped for inspection before reaching the port. The shipping documents matched the truck load of 80 panels. But... according to the manifest, your husband only sent 20 panels to Nigeria. My husband isn't a criminal. What did you find in our home ? Weapons ? Drugs ? We found receipts for money wired to Mali. Do you know how much he sent ? - No. - Excuse me... I've yet to be given a transcript of the search at Traoré's home. We'll send it to you. Your husband sent 4,300 euros to Tahira Traoré. Do you know who she is ? Ma'am... Can we say your husband hid many aspect of his life from you ? Of course we can say that. But what does that prove ? That he's a liar ? That he cheated on me ? That he doesn't love me ? Claudia, come here. Ikendu wasn't on a trip. He was in jail. And he's there again now. He has a wife in Mali, her surname is Traoré too. He wanted to bring her here without telling me. - Who told you ? - The cops. She doesn't look like his wife. If that were his wife, he'd be in the picture too. Husband and wife... I assembled panels at Paul's. My second job was... transporting coke from Zurich to Bellinzona and delivering it to clients. My third job was sleeping... with rich ladies. Was Mr. Traoré here aware of this ? Yes. He did the same thing, more or less. When you moved to Zurich, who delivered the coke in Bellinzona instead of you ? - He did. - I did not. Calm down. There's no proof that Baruba is telling the truth. He's accusing my client out of self-interest. You offered him a plea bargain. How much time will he get ? 18 months, a year ? Ma'am... these men are desperate. You know they'd say anything to get a lighter sentence. Mr. Traoré, the coke was paid for by the solar panels sent to Salerno. Correct ? Mr. Baruba, correct ? Correct. - Did Mr. Traoré know ? - He knew everything. I didn't know shit ! Visitor. Come in. Leave your ID here. How are you ? So so, and you ? I have lots of questions. Why didn't you tell me the truth about Salerno ? Let's not talk about that. Then what shall we talk about, the birds outside ? Sit down. Why didn't Alex tell me the truth before ? You can't speak about the case. Who's this woman you wanted to bring from Mali ? Riva told me you've sent her money. - The visit's over. - Why ? I said no speaking about the case but you just mentioned the DA. Tahira is my cousin, I didn't tell you so you wouldn't worry. That's all. Ike, you ruined everything. Everything we had ! Yard time. Cigarette ? Mr. Traoré, what is the relationship between Paul Okibi here and Fatai Idris ? I don't want to talk about Paul. Then talk to us about Fatai Idris. - They help me with work. - And your work was... going to Salerno to ship 80 solar panels and giving an envelope to a port worker. You knew you were doing something illegal. Did Paul Okibi ask you to do this or was it Fatai Idris ? I don't want to talk about this. Mr. Okibi, you recognized Ikendu Traoré's voice on the phone while he spoke to Fatai Idris in code. Yes. So Ikendu Traoré was part of the organization ? Yes. Mr. Traoré, if you confirm you were part of the organization, we'll move forward. I will not confirm that. See ? It's moving. That's the heart. You're not happy. You can get dressed. My head hurts. Have they given you anything ? Yes, some pills. Have they told you when I'm getting out ? Dunno. Soon. It's stuffy in here. I need some air, understand ? Feel it ? How are you ? Fine. I'm fine. Good evening. Sorry to bother you... I was curious to see where you live. - Some wine ? - Sure. Do you know Idris Fatai from Zurich ? He's the godfather of Paul's daughter. That's him. He's the big fish Riva wants to nail. - Interesting. - Why ? Does your husband seem like Fatai's right-hand man ? - He's on the sidelines. - Right-hand man ? Paul recognized Ikendu's voice in various phone taps with Fatai. - That's insanity ! - Trying to reduce his sentence. - Does Riva believe him ? - 800 grams of coke were found when he was arrested and your husband was there too. But he won't snitch on Paul. My husband's an asshole. He wants to play saint. Actually, I didn't want to go home. Why ? You don't have to answer that. I'm usually the one who says that. My dog has cancer. I was supposed to pick him up from the vet today but... They wouldn't let me take him home, he's being put down tomorrow. I'm sorry. I want Ikendu to get out. He's suffering, so am I. The girls are suffering too. Whose fault is it ? Paul's and Alex's. You're accusing my husband ? Ikendu didn't have a job, we gave him a hand. You didn't do anything for him. And now you come here accusing us. You don't understand a thing and never will. I don't understand a thing... because you and Paul have been lying to us. Why do you think he's innocent ? Because he married a white lady ? - It's for you. - Tell them I'll call back. It was the gynecologist, she said to call her right away. Are you pregnant ? - If I were ? - Stupid me, I should've known. Alina, leave me alone now. Please. Stay out of it. Don't expect me to look after it like I did with Claudia. You won't take care of it, like you didn't take care of us. Bye. - Come on. - Go. Bye-bye. Here we are. Hello ! - Welcome. - Thanks. Here we are... This time, Alina will stay with us a bit longer. Hi ! Hi, Claudia ! It's grandma. Hello. - Hi. - Alina called me. Patricia, I do have a heart, you know. Is that all ? No, I came to help look after poor little Claudia. Spare me your lecture. Someone needs to be straight with you because you're selfish. You neglect your kids. Mom, watch your mouth. The girls don't even speak Czech, why didn't you teach them ? Do they even know where you grew up ? Who your father was ? Or are you ashamed of us ? You tell them. I have nothing to do with it. Where's Ikendu ? - Alina didn't tell you ? - No. Can I have some water ? I'm exhausted. In jail. What ? He seemed like an honest person. I don't know what to think of him. And him of you ? He thinks I'm a slut because I slept around before him. Happy ? Don't shout, calm down. You said I neglect the girls. And I'm sickening. I'm impossible to love, right ? This... is what he thinks of me. You all do. How nice ! So nice ! - Can't hear a thing. - Recognize your husband's voice ? - No. - I still don't understand. Why wasn't an audio examination performed on these recordings ? The sound quality's awful. Ma'am, if your husband doesn't start talking, he risks getting three years. A foreigner who gets over two years gets sent back to his country. And he can't come back to Europe for 10 years. It would all be easier if your husband cooperated. We could work with Attorney Russo to keep the sentence under two years. I can let you see your husband now, if you'd like. Maybe you can convince him. No. I can't. Maybe you should think it over at home. He could get sent back to Africa. Think it over ? Nobody realizes I've given my all, not even you. - You have to give more. - More ? Please, I'm pregnant and don't know what to do. Shall I keep the baby or not ? My husband could've confessed right away. If he wanted to be with me, he would've. Now you expect me to go ask him to do it ? How low do you expect me to go ? - No way ! - Does he know you're pregnant ? No. I had a dream. We're in Salerno. Me and you. There are lots of people. They put me in a cardboard box and toss me into the sea. The box is small, but I'm not afraid, because it's cardboard. While I sink, it gets darker and darker around me. And the box doesn't dissolve. I sink deeper and deeper. I can't get out. Ike... Say something. I have to go. I'm sorry. There's a woman looking for Ikendu, she's African. Say what you did, come on. I'm innocent. Listen... I have to say something. It might not be my place but I'll tell you. Your wife is pregnant. - What ? - Your wife is pregnant. Pregnant ? Yes, she's carrying a child. I assemble panels... with Alex. I do whatever Paul tells me to. I go to Salerno. I pay the port worker, like everyone in Italy does. I was stupid because I never asked... questions. When Paul asked me to deliver a package to... Boldrini, what was I to do ? His daughter was ill. Everything was moving so fast. I grabbed the package... but never thought there were drugs inside. Now I know... - How many packages did you deliver ? - Just one. Are you talking to Fatai Idris in this phone call ? Yes, Paul told me to call Fatai from Salerno when the ship was loaded. Are you talking to Fatai again here ? - Fatai's talking but not to me. - To whom then ? - I don't know. - Quit playing these games ! Give us five minutes, please. I spoke to Riva. You'll all get the same sentence, 20 months reduced to 10. But only if you confirm what Riva wants to hear. Otherwise, there's no proof to nail Fatai. Understand ? I don't know what a chicken is. A chicken is a pellet, and a pellet is 100 grams of coke. I don't want to lose my honor, it's all I have. Give up your honor. That's the price you must pay to stay here with your wife and your baby. Well ? The voice in those two calls is mine. Who were you talking to ? Fatai Idris. Good. You confirm that the shipment of 67 solar panels corresponded to the arrival of a certain quantity of... ? Coke. In one of the calls, you talk about "15 chickens", what is "15 chickens" ? 15 pellets. How many grams is that ? 1.5 kilos. When Alex Baruba moved to Zurich, according to the calls with Mr. Idris, 27 chickens arrived here in Bellinzona. Correct ? Correct. Tell me how much coke you delivered here in Bellinzona. 2.7 kilos. Okay. Print the statement and we'll sign it. As your attorney requested, you'll soon be released from jail until trial, which will be a mere formality at this point. After the trial, you'll only have to serve a few months. Hello ! I'm glad you're out. Just for a few days. - I'll go take a shower. - Hold on. We'll go to the beach for three days, all right ? Just me and you. It'll be great, you'll see. Ikendu ! - You're back ! - Yes. Will you come pick me up after practice ? No, grandma will. We're going away for three days, me and your mom. When I get back, we'll be together. We'll go bike riding and dancing. Claudia, come here. Gotta go. See you soon ? Yes, very soon. Isn't it nice ? It didn't cost much at all. Like it ? I made it with all my love. Thanks. You know, your cousin came by last week. She left this letter for you. Don't smoke. I'll go buy some groceries. See you in a bit. Russo knew and I didn't. What are you talking about ? You told him you were pregnant, but didn't tell me. I was distressed. I didn't want to tell anybody. It slipped out with him, I'm sorry. Come on... forget about it. It's a boy, I know it. You already have two daughters, the third will be a boy. I already picked a name: Mehdi. Tahira told me about Mehdi. Why did she do that ? The mouth isn't made to say ugly things. Folks, come here ! Have a glass of wine. - None for her, she's pregnant. - Just a drop, all right ? Congratulations on your pregnancy. Cheers to these visitors and their baby on the way. Cheers ! Why'd you tell them I'm pregnant ? Why not ? I'm not anymore. What ? I'm not pregnant anymore. Ike, the baby is gone. I lost it. How ? I didn't lose it, I had an abortion. - That's not true. - It is. I did it two days before you confessed. I had to decide. Riva said they were going to send you back to Africa. I didn't want to have another baby on my own. I couldn't handle that. No, Ike. Please don't. I was sincere, we have to be sincere. Ike, please. Talk to me. No ! Don't go, no ! Ike, please ! I sacrificed my honor for that baby. I confessed to things I didn't do for our baby. I had no idea you would do that. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant ? Why'd you tell Russo ? What kind of woman are you ? You're shitty. Don't talk to me that way, I'm not shitty. I kept trying to talk to you but you wouldn't say a word. I was in jail, I wasn't me. You don't understand shit ! If you loved me, you would've confessed right away. But you only did it for the baby. You don't understand shit. That baby was a blessing. A future, a family... Now where is it ? Where ? That baby wasn't a blessing because I wasn't well. I couldn't sleep, I was vomiting, the baby wasn't well either. Enough. Be quiet. I'm going to the police to tell them my confession was a lie. I'm not afraid to go back to Africa. - I'll reclaim my honor. - What honor ? An honor coated in coke ? Ike ! I still love you. We can have another baby, okay ? Let's do it right now. Ikendu, my cousin, I'm in Switzerland and you are traveling, but your wife welcomed me with such kindness. I hope you've found the life you longed for here. Many things have changed back home. There's no life in Léré anymore. But now I'm in Europe, thanks to you and I'll never stop thanking you. Let us not forget our mothers, our brothers and sisters. Big hug. Your cousin, Tahira. "You're awesome" Hi ! What are you looking at ? What happened ? Leave me alone. Get lost ! FEDERAL CRIMINAL COURT You promised we'd go dancing. Go sit down. Court is in session, all rise. Be seated. Mr. Traoré, do you confirm the statement you gave on October 22 to the Public Prosecutor, District Attorney Riva ? Mr. Traoré. Can I say something ? Go ahead. In my country, where I'm from, we have to live the way Islamists tell us to. I don't want to live the way they tell me to, I want to live my own way. In Calabria I worked in the fields for 20 euros. No Italians, just Africans. I confirm this too. For a while I have wondered why Alex and Paul claim I'm a criminal. I think they said it just to please the District Attorney. That's all she wants to hear. Because we Blacks are used to submitting to the Whites. I confirm this too. Just tell us if you confirm the statement you gave, that's all. I confirm. All right. We will now deliberate. Court is adjourned. Coming ? Subtitles: Laser S. Film s.r.l. - Rome
