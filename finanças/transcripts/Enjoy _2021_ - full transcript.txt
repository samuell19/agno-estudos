No, no, no, no, no! Archie, Archie! No, no, no, it's fucking shit! Archibald. I told you I'm not going back in there. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. You carry on like this you're going to have to pay for him out of your own pocket money. Oh, I'm not paying for shit. You get back in there right now. Make me, make me! Jesus Christ. I think perhaps we could maybe. Start working on some new techniques to help Archibald feel more confident. But as you know, he can come across a bit shy. I'm not shy! He's just fucking useless! We need to get him to a place where he can return to school. Of course. He loves comics, superhero film, stuff like that, perhaps that could be an entry point. I don't know, maybe you could even reenact some of them together. Oh, fuck off mum! We can certainly give that a go. I'm not performing shit! Don't worry, because, as you know, I've got a lot of experience working with kids like Archie, so I'll be sure to try out a lot of different techniques with him. Great, thanks, Michael. Archie? So the numbers are: zero for not at all, one for several days, two for more than half the days and three for nearly everything. So, trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much? Hi, this is Pluralization. This is a new piece called Icarus. This is the X-Factor generation can't say... Yeah. This is the Simon Cowell generation, can't say no to the temptation out of the womb onto a PlayStation when multidisciplinary antidisestablishmentari-anism. The scientists are teaching, we ain't learning like Icarus, we're burning. Wake up, feel the heat. The penguins are dying on our feet. Hey. Yeah, hi. Oh, lovely. I haven't seen her in ages, yes. I've just got in from work, so I'm just gonna very quickly top my face and I'll be there. Yeah, I'm not sure if he's coming. I'll check. OK, bye. You sure you don't wanna come? Mike? Sorry? Tonight? Yeah, you know I've got work to do. Such a shame, sure, everyone would really love to see you. Yeah, ehh umm, I've got a kid tomorrow, so. All right. How's he getting on? Not great. Why is that, then? It seems pointless, to be honest. I think I hate him. I'm sorry. But, you're probably right. I'm sure he is a little shit, just like the last one you taught. But please don't get angry at me for saying this. Yeah, what? You are still being quite negative. Ok, well, I don't think that's true. I'm only saying you really don't need to get defensive. I'm not. You been doing your breathy thing? Progressive muscle relaxation, yes I have. All right, well, maybe you need to actively focus on the positives a little bit more. Come on mate, let's take a look. It can't be that bad. How would you know? Sure. OK, but why don't we just... Touch it again and I'll have you fired. OK, sure, no worries mate. Stop calling me mate, we aren't mates. OK, that's quite a rude way to speak to someone, really, isn't it? And I think your mum would be quite disappointed if I told her you weren't doing any work. You are not a proper teacher, are you? OK, that's... I am. My mum said you're a musician and you just do this for money, because nobody makes any money in music. Did she? Yeah. Okay. Well, it's actually a spoken word and I actually have made some money from it, which is more than a lot of people can say. She said proper money, money to live off. She said it's not a route any sensible person would take. Ok, well, that's I mean, that depends on what your definition of sensible is. She said she listened to you on SoundCloud. Ok, I think we're getting a bit off topic. She said you weren't very good. But in any case, she's not really the target audience. She sent me the link. Can we just get back to work. What kind of name is Plural Eyes Nation. It. It's just, I don't think this. OK, OK, so technically, it's because I. I pluralize words, and so then I perform them in front of people, lots of sets of eyes. So it's Plural-eyes Nation, which is a pun pluralization. Anyway, I think we should be getting back to this comprehensive Doesn't help that your music is a piece of fucking shit as well. Well, what the fuck would you know, you stupid little prick? Look. I understand some words were said. And perhaps neither party is entirely innocent. However, I think it might be good for Archibald to have some sort of male, man in his life at the moment and he responds to you. Just between you and me, I don't think, I don't really understand what's going on for him. And, I do ask all the time, but he doesn't. Do you have an idea? Oh, no. It's probably just a phase. OK. Well, with that in mind, then I'd like to just forget about today. Just continue with the schedule as normal, clean slate. Okay, thanks. Great. Well, that's that then. Would you say it's a positive impact? I suppose so, but... you can't see it. Well, it's never really it, is it Michael? It's a process, but yeah, the theory behind it is that this engaging and meaningful, purposeful activity will help you maintain a higher level of general well-being. I'm going to refer you to a higher intensity set of sessions, there will be a bit of a wait. But in the meantime, I think it's important you maintain your commitment to these activities until someone is able to get in touch regarding the next steps. Ah! Fuck! I think you've made some real improvements, Michael, and you should be really proud. Oh, that was lovely. Thank you. It's alright. What's that spice? It's paprika. Mmm. Yes. It's just paprika. It's good. I listened to the song you sent me. I thought it was brilliant. Oh, yeah. Thanks. No, honestly, it was great. What was that like? Crunching looping sound going through it? It was a toilet brush. Well. Yeah, I used the toilet brush as a sample. Wow. Well, I really liked it. Are you happy with it? Oh, I don't know, maybe. You know, you haven't asked me about my day over a week now. I'm trying. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, maybe you could try too? I said, I was sorry. You don't need to keep apologizing. Well, yeah, I mean, it doesn't seem to make a difference either way, so... That's not what I meant you're not listening. Oh, go away. Go away? I really don't feel like I have a... Don't bother then. Oh, right what? Should I just do what you do and just mumble to each other the whole time? Or you can start talking to me like I'm fucking human being? Kneel before me. I said kneel! Is this not your natural state? It is the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation? The bright lure of freedom diminishes your lives' hope, the mad scramble for happiness. For an identity you were made to be ruled. In the end you'll always kneel. Not to men like you. There are no men like me! Very impressive. Yeah, it was like Loki was in the room with me. Yeah. Did you enjoy that? Maybe we can do different film next time. Black Panther. Cool. Well, I think we've made some real progress there, Archie. Do you ever get sad? Well, everyone gets sad. But, do you ever get really sad? Why? Because sometimes I get sad for quite a long time Right. And I don't know how to tell it to anyone. Like I want to but when I try sight the words then I just got angry. I think it's why people don't like me. Hey, come on mate, I like you. You don't understand. I do. I do understand. And how do I make it better? Well, I don't know. I don't know the answer. Does it get better? Sure, it does. I'm sorry. That's all right. You don't need to apologize. Hi, it's Katie, leave a message. Hi. I just want to see how your day was and if you are around later, maybe we could get a drink. Also, I wanted to say that I'm gonna... anyway, just give me a call. All right. I read about a man getting drowned once. His friends thought he was waving to them from the sea, but really he was drowning. And then I thought that in a way, it is true of life too, that a lot of people pretend out of bravery rarely, that they are very jolly and old resorting to chess, but really they do not feel at all at home in the world or able to make friends easily. So they joke a lot and laugh and people think they're quite all right and jolly nice too. But sometimes the brave pretense breaks down. And then like the poor man in this poem they are lost. Not waving but drowning.
