[music playing] I'll race you home. OK. Dinner at The Paradise. Loser pays. You're on. [music playing] Sweet dreams. You bastard. Julia, I haven't got time for this nonsense. What if I'd really taken a fall? You fall off a horse? No way. You think you're so damn smart. It's my greatest charm. No way. [music playing] I liked that. But what would your daddy say? Who cares what my daddy would say? Besides, he works you too hard. You have no time for fun. And what about Charlie? You're jealous? Of that idiot? He's crazy about me. So why don't you put him out of his misery? Marry him. Oh I just might. He's the best catch in the entire province. Happy honeymoon. [music playing] You lousy bastard! Go to hell, you son of a bitch! Needs another couple of years. Three months at most. Then to the bottle. You're wrong, Corkscrew. Two more years. By then it will havedeveloped a proper essence. Don Pedro, wine is like a man. Old men are good for many things, but they are seldom satisfying. Ask any woman. Mature, that's what they want. Neither not too old, nor too young. In three months, this winewill be nectar for the gods. Damn it, Corkscrew, whydo you always counter me? Because you're always wrong. Andre! Come here. Are you two at it again? What is it this time? Find gold? Ah, he has forgotten about that silly dream. Never mind about my dreams. Here. Taste this. Excellent, but a little too early to bottle it. - I knew it. - Wait. Wait. Andre, how much more timedo you think it needs? A couple of years, right? Oh, no, no, no. Three or four months at most. Of course, that's only his opinion. And yours isn't worthflushing down the toilet. You're fired. Get out. How many times today? Five. And you? Ever since you've been working for the Count, bottling his dirty water by the truckload, you've forgotten everything I taught you. [music playing] [horse galloping] George, what are all theserumors I hear about Don Pedro having problems? All I know is that the banksare restricting his credit, and he's having a devilof a job paying his bills. Really? Yes. Good lord. It's amazing. Poor old Pedro, eh? You know, these landshave been in our families for generations. I'd hate to see anything happen. I tell you, if the situationbecomes really dangerous, you let me know. Maybe I can help. I hate those bloody banks. Don Miguel, you're alreadystretched to the limit. Oh, come on, George. Let's not start that again, huh? May I come in? Hey, Carlie. Come on in. What have you done with my daughter, huh? I raced her home. It appears that I won. And with Julia, appearancescan be very deceptive. Anyway, you deserve a drink. Help yourself. Did you get the money? Yes, but at a higher rate of interest, and just enough to pay the vendors. Those damned bankers. They're a pack of thieves. The orders? Very slow. [music playing] Apparently people don't want good wine anymore. Oh, it's not that, Don Pedro. The wine is expensive. The market is crowded with others that are cheaper and acceptable. Acceptable? They're offensive to the taste. And today who has taste? I thought I fired you. - You did. - Then go. Leave. Get out. The time has come to makesome changes, Don Pedro. We must speed up the process. No, never. Papa. Papa. Maybe you should see how thingsare being done these days before we go bankrupt. Don Miguel saved his winery by modernizing-- Don't talk to me about the Count and his corruption of tradition. But Papa-- Leave me alone. I don't want to talk about it. I know, I'm fired. [music playing] [horse hooves clopping] [groaning] [laughing] Oh my god. Oh, Julia. Christ. Get the hell out of here. Couldn't you two find somewhere else to amuse yourselves? Julia, this is incredible. That's exactly the right word. Well you know I've always dreamed of making love in a barn. This is a stable for horses. Yes. Even better. The smell of horse sweat. And manure. Oh, the hay creeping inand tickling you everywhere. It gives me a skin rash. Oh, it's so, so different. You should try it, Julia. I'm sorry, Stella. You're not my type. Come on, that's enough. It certainly is. [laughing] What's wrong with your sister? Doesn't she like to make love? I don't think she's ever tried it. Don't be ridiculous, darling. Julia, a virgin? The only virgins are statues in churches. I won, Julia. Dinner's on you. I'm not hungry. Maybe some other time. Hey, come on, darling. You must alwaays pay your debts, huh? Don't worry, Don Miguel. I'm not letting her off the hook. I'm going home to change. Be right back. See you soon. Ciao. [music playing] What a bore. Oh, come on. All men are sometimes. No, he's a very nice young man. Not that young. Mm. Hello, Father. Julia. Greetings, Don Miguel. Hello, Stella. Can I offer you something to drink? What would you like? Whiskey? Brandy? Brandy. A double. Michael, you and I aregoing to have a serious talk after dinner, right? Oh, not tonight, Father. Please, I promised Stella I'dtake her to San Sebastian. What? It's very late. Well not if we start right now it's not. Come on, Stella. Let's go. Look, I promise we'll talkabout everything tomorrow. Good night, Julia. Talking business won'tever be easy with him, ever. I know. I know. I'm as worried as you are. But maybe he'll improve if Igive him more responsibility, make him head of the winery. Head of the winery? You'd put Michael over Andre? Darling. Your brother is heir to the estate. He's my only son. Sooner or later he'llinherit everything anyway. Perfect. And sooner or later we'll lose everything. Come on. [music playing] Was I very late? Let's just go. The sooner we get back, the better. OK. [music playing] [car starting] I know your father quite well. A fine gentleman. But he despises gambling. I see you haven't inherited that dislike. It appears you've had a bit of bad luck. That's theunderstatement of the year. Well, luck is like aweather vane, always changing. Care for another chance? Well, of course. It's possible. Anything is possible. You look after the lady, hmm? [music playing] Shall we make the arrangements? Thank you very much. Is everything all right? Perfect. Where's my cut? Do you want it now? Well yes, unless you plan on giving it to me in front of Junior. He sticks to me like glue. OK, let's go to a cashier. Just what I had in mind. [music playing] You barely touched your dinner. I told you I wasn't hungry. Now if you're finished, can we go? I'll take you home soon. But first I'd like to talk. Julia, we've known each other for a long time. And, well, I've never had a chance to tell you how I feel about you. You don't have to, Charlie. We'll always be good friends. Yes. But it's about something more. More than friendship? I don't think it's worth looking for more. Do you? But I-- you see-- let me explain. I can't leave it's so late. Waiter, check? Yes, ma'am. Oh, no. All that about you paying? It's just a joke. No. Gambling debts are sacred. My father would be very angry if I didn't pay. Now please get the car. [music playing] I might as well havethrown it out the window. Calm down, darling. How much did you lose? Don't ask. Much more than I've got. Well then, let your father pay for it. Mm. The old man's got the money,but he won't let go of it. There must be some way of getting it. Yes, but I need it now. If I don't pay the casinos rightaway, they'll tell my father. So? Then he'll pay. Just write me out of the will. He detests gambling. My mother was a gambler. It's what tore them apart. Well let's see. What can you sell? Jewels? They're in the bank. A painting? A painting? Sweetheart, I doubt verymuch those goons at the casino share my father's taste in art. What about that safe in your father's office? Um, banknotes, gold coins? Money. It's a hell of a lot of money, but I don't know the combination. Who does? My father, and Andre. Can you strike a deal with Andre? Well I doubt it. Damn bastard's honest. Hmm. Then I have to get somebody else. Who? You have an idea? I have a little friend who happens to be an expert at opening safes. Stella, you're wonderful. I know, darling. When do we do it? Do it? How about right now? I mean the safe, darling. Well, the office is closed on Sunday. Sunday night would be perfect. Perfect, darling. Mm. [music playing] This won't take long. All right, I'm going to wait in the hall, make sure there are no surprises. [music playing] Relax, baby. Everything's all right. Finished already? Child's play. Quite the wad, sonny boy. Let's go. Thank you. [music playing] Good morning, Andre. Good morning, George. If you'll open the safe,I'll prepare the payroll. [music playing] Do you know if Don Miguelhas been in the safe? Why do you ask? All the money's gone. [music playing] The safe was not forced. It hasn't been tampered with. Whoever took the money must have used the key. I don't understand. You don't think I took it do you? I'm not saying you did. I can't believe that youdid, but what am I to think? There's only two people who had the key, you and me. You're wrong, Don Miguel. There was at least one other person. Hmm? The man who took it. Oh, yes. Well-- yeah, but who? How? I don't know. Oh, Andre. This is just as embarrassing forme as I'm sure it is for you. I don't understand. What are you getting at? Don't you want to say anything? Don't you want to tell me anything? No, sir. [sighs wearily] Andre-- Andre, it's nosecret that your father was in serious financial trouble. So maybe you thought you should borrow the money. Don't go on, Don Miguel. And don't bring my father into this. Well, what do you want me to do? Call the police! Are you joking? This is a private matter. If you won't call them, I will. You certainly will not. This will be handled in the traditional manner-- between the families involved. We know nothing about your money. But since Andre wasresponsible for it, here. Take it. In my house, we pay our debtswhether we owe them or not. Don Pedro, I'd rather anythingin the world happen than this, but in my circumstances, I'm forced. We've had our differences, Miguel, but I thought we were friends. Now I must ask you to leave my house and never set foot in it againunless it is to apologize for the offense you given. Don Pedro, I understand. I hope that day comes very soon. You should have insistedthey call the police. It's useless. No one can reason with them. These medieval scenes of honor. They make me want to puke. And I tell you, I don't like them anymore, the marquis or your father. Their made for each other. So you are finally goingto take the winemaking courses in Jerez. Yes, if I can get admitted. Give this to Don Sebastian,a vittener I know in Jerez. We are friends. He will give you workand a corner to sleep in. I'm sorry. I can't ask him for anything more. It's more than enough, Corkscrew. Always let me know whereyou are and how you are doing. Promise? Promise. You've finally done it. You finally gotten rid of Andre. Julia, what are you talking about? Can you honestly believe, father, that Andre would steal from us? Now, Julia, you listen to me. Andre's father is down to his last penny right? Yet he writes me a check for the full amount? Where did he get the money? Don Pedro has friends. He could have borrowed from them. Julia, I know you like Andre. I like Andre. Everybody likes Andre. But-- but what was I to think? Hmm? Julia, you're making a fool of yourself. Everybody knows you're crazy about Andre. Shut up. You know what I think. I think you should marry Charlie. It would solve all our problems,stop this stupid bickering. Damn you, Michael. Well, think about it, Julia. Being Charlie's wife won't stop you from being Andre's mistress. [crashing] Did you see that? She's crazy. You asked for it. Where you going? Jerez. Andre, I don't want you to go. Don't make things more difficult for me, Julia. In your house, I'd never be anything more than your father's hired help. I wasn't born for that. If I put up with everything until now, it's been because of you. And now I'm going because of you. I want a future to offer you. Then take me with you. I can't. I have no money. I'll get money. I'll sell my jewels. Is that how you want us to start? Living at your expense? You don't know me, or youwouldn't be saying that. What you want is to be freeof everything including me. That's not true! Then take me with you. I said no. I love you, Julia. And nothing will stop mefrom coming back for you. Unless I stop you. I swear I'm coming back. And I swear I won't be waiting. Julia, stop it. That's a lie! If you're gonna go, then just go! I'll be back. I never wanna see you again! Never! Never! Never! Never! So Corkscrew sent you. Yes, sir. Now what's the old goat doing? Still arguing with everyone? All the time. Ah, a good man. I don't know why I ever allowed him to leave me. Agreed I'll give you workand a place to sleep. If you want to take the day off,you'll have to work at night. Can you handle it? I'll try. Thank you. Ha ha, good. At night we do the decanting. It's the hardest job. I know. Then why the hell do you want the days off? To study. Well, it's up to you. As long as you keep up the schedule, what you do with your freetime is your business. Thanks. The next one please. Surface is clean and bright,no particles in suspension. Yellow color with a slightstraw-colored reflection. Very good appearance. [sniffing] Characteristic primary aroma,penetrating, clean and deep. [sniffing] With a marked accent of hazelnuts and a reminiscence of hay. Dry and personal. [spitting] Sharp. Delicate and elegant at the same time. With a long and deepexpression in its aftertaste. The two fundamentalcharacteristics of a Fino, elegance and personality. Where did you learn the artof wine tasting, young man. In Oyati from my father. You're the son of Don Pedro Oyati. Yes, ma'am. Your ability in wine tastingdoes favor to your family. Thank you. If you'd told me sooner perhaps we could have spared the exam. Excuse me, but I wantto be admitted for myself, not for being my father's son. Then congratulations, you have succeeded. Wait! Wait! Another wild party last night? My friends, I have somethingvery important to tell you. You know and I know thatthe future of this country is in the hands of the youth. I am not exactly young. [laughter] So I have decided today tohand over the management of this winery to my only son, Michael. [applause] We hope for your continued collaboration because we will both need allthe help that you can give us. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Since this is the day for decisions, I think you should know that I've also made one. - Oh?- I decided to go to work. You work? Where? In Don Pedro's winery. If you've said that tooffend me, you've succeeded. I didn't say it to offend you. I want to learn how to make wine. And to do that, I have to go to Oyati. Well, what's the matter with my winery? Father, you've justhanded over the management of your winery to my darling brother. I don't want to hurt you,but I can't work with him. I love you. It would be helpful to revealthe general instructions. What for? They've already been approved. Just follow them. Well, there are alwaysdetails to be double checked. Well, then do it. I'm leaving on vacation. Stella's waiting for me. We'll go over the details when I get back. Look, Simon, I'm trusting you. Nothing new while I'm gone. Is that clear? Mmm hmm. All right. I'll see you in a week or two. STELLA: What kept you so long? Bunch of idiots. Gonna fire half of them when I get back. Good. Teach them a lesson. The wonderful thing about wine, sweetheart, is that it makes itself. And makes us rich. [laughing] MICHAEL: To Madrid, huh! STELLA: Woo! What do you think? Better than last year's. No, no, no, no, no. Worse. Damn you. You say that only to annoy me. There's no doubt in my mindit's similar to the vines of Bitherhone. Like a chestnut to an egg. - I'm telling you-- - No, no, no, no, no. You're wasting my time withyour dreams of fine gold. Sooner or later with or without you, I will master fine gold. Shouldn't be too difficult. All you need are the vines of Bitherhone,its pails, the air, and its sun. But the vines aren't for sale. And if they were, you don'thave the money to buy a twig, so you're left with pails, air, and sun. Make me wine with that. I know very well I have and haven't got. I also have a right to dream. Fantasy, perhaps. It just might become a reality. Except for an old fool like you. Always pestering me, always nagging, always-- Are you two ever going to stop arguing? Come in, my dear. Come in. This cretin is out to destroy my patience. Impossible. He doesn't have any. You see. I came to offer myself as an apprentice. Maybe you need a referee. Julia, you're always welcome,no matter what the reason. Start now if you wish. Take all the time you need. Alejandra's waiting for me upstairs. Thank you, Don Pedro. And promise me you'llwatch your blood pressure. Have you heard from Andre. Nothing. He hasn't written? He hasn't called? Not a word. It's as if the earth had swallowed him up. We are now going to seewhat parameters contribute to what is known as theprofile of the different types of sherry. Now somebody calls this an adventure which cannot be experienced twice. In the first place, we have the climate, that wonderful combinationof Atlantic and Mediterranean climates, which in some accounts compensate or moderate each other. [giggling] Shhh, no noise, gentlemen. You might wake him up. Well, oh, Sleeping Beauty awakes. Excuse me. I-- Please relax. Since it seems you like to stay up late, starting today you'll havean extra hour of sleep. The hour of this class. You're suspended. But I-- Go back to sleep but do it outside. I'm sorry-- Leave immediately. What are you doing here? I had to see you. They found out who stole the money. Who was it? I don't know. I'm sorry. I guess it was too much to expect. Sometimes I feel like I'mfighting an army of ghosts. There's always something in my way. Not always, darling. So why did you really come here? I came to see you. To get me to go back to your father's winery? My father doesn't believethat you took the money. Nobody does. He wants you back. Did he send you? No, he'd be furious if he knew. Andre, he's too proud to ask. Please we're in danger of losing everything. He needs you. I can't go back with you, Julia. Not yet anyway. I have to prove that I can make it on my own. Men. You and your damn pride. It's stupid. All right. I have one more thing to do. If I fail, I'll go back with you. When? Tomorrow. Promise? Promise. What are you doing here? You've been expelled. I'll leave but not until I've had my say. All right but be quick about it. I worked all night. That's why I fell asleep in your class. And you expect me to feel sorry for you. No! No, I don't want your pity. Then why did you come? Because I know your subjectand I want to prove it to you. You're a very determined young man. All right. I'll accept your challenge. Show me what you can do. Where did mildew first appear? In North America. In what year, and how did it come to Europe? It first appeared inEurope in 1878 from graftings imported from America. In what Spanish region wasmildew first detected and when? Barcelona in 1880. What agent causes the disease? A Phycomyces fungus knownas plasmapora viticola. PROFESOR: What parts of the plant are affected? ANDRE: The leaves, grapes,and the shoots, but especially in the leaves and grapes. Tell me some external factors affecting the development of the fungus. Temperatures rangingbetween 12 and 30 degrees centigrade with an optimum of 24 degrees and a relative humidity of more than 85% of air. Strategies and remedies. Best is preventative treatment, spraying with copper-based products. Very good. I'm a curious man. If you can learn that much asleep, I'd like to see what you can do awake. Come back to class and show me. [relieved sigh] Thank you, sir. - For you. - Hey, wait! Congratulations. I have something for you. See me at the party. [music playing] [singing in spanish] I just received aletter from a Don Basilio. He needs the services of an oenologist. I think he's got problems. Do you feel up to it. If I'm chosen, senor, I'll give him 100%. Thought as much. I've written you aletter of recommendation. How soon can you leave? Right away. And miss this? Beautiful but they can wait. Excuse me. I'm looking for Don Basilio Hernandez. Well, you found him. What do you want? I'm Andre Oyati. I have a letter of recommendation from the Oenology Institute. It's about time. Come with me. The soil isn't bad. It could be improved without too much cost. But you don't need an oenologist. What you need is water. Water. Here? It's more expensive than wine. Where would I get water? Those mountains. Fine. But they're there, and I am here. What is it? You see something? Something strange is going on. The stock isn't developing properly. What it mean? I suspect some kind of foreign body is speeding up the fermentation. While I try to identify it, play it by ear. We'll speed up the decanting. We can't. Not without Michael's permission. You heard him. We can't change theprogram unless he approves. Then call him. It's got to be changed. [singing] Look, my friend. If you tell me you found theashes of St. Peter down there, I believe it.But water is a fairy tale. But you have looked for it, haven't you? Yes or no. Long time ago. If I do it now, they put me away like crazy man. Listen, this is my safe and sane world-- beautiful from morning 'tilnight and always on the path to start. Right? I can wait. This is all I have. But when this party isover, you and I and the rod will go out in search of water. Like a bull, you never stop. There it is. That damn bacteria will ruin the entire harvest. - You sure? - Positive. We'll have to decant the entire stock, filter it, clean the deposits,the clusters on the wall. Only when they're absolutely spotless can we fill them again. Do you realize what that means? Simon, I do my job bysaying what must be done. Now it's your problem. Did you speak to Michael? I can't find him. How stupid. We have to deal with an idiot like this. Call his father. He's in here either. He went to Jerez. Then find him. This is a crisis. You must try to understandthat with our entrance, it's a common market,things are very precarious. I know. I know, but, gentlemen, you'vealways had faith in me before. And I tell you this harvest isthe finest I've ever produced. Our bank has been morethan generous about investing in your wineries. With them, we were buildinga profitable future. But times have changed. Don Miguel, there is something I must say. What is it? This palace is a jewel, magnificent, but it must cost a fortune to maintain. Not exactly cheap. Now I have a friend, a very rich friend, he would pay you afortune for this property. Cash. I know we've discussed it. Then your worries, our worries, would be over. I'm sorry, no. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. I will never sell this palace. Never. I could not rob mychildren and their children of their traditional home. Well, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I must ask you to continue to have faith in me, in myvineyards, and in this harvest. It's the phone for the Don, sir. Impossible. He can't come to the telephone. We're not to be disturbed. It's useless. The count won't come to the phone. Then say a few words overthe grave of his harvest. I tell you, my friend, we're wasting our time and the worth your money. Look over here. Nothing. It's hopeless. There never was water here and never will be. If there's an underground stream, it has to go right through here. Suit yourself. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. [speaking spanish] Go back. Nothing. My fault. But here. What about now? What do you say about that? Gone crazy. Back out of the circle and enter again. Why it's moving. Because there's water there, Carico! Water! A river of it! [laughing] Shhh. A letter from Andre. Bullheaded, just like his father. What does he say? That he's been looking fora way to make better wine, but he's found something more valuable-- water. I think he's gone soft in the head. "It's imperative that I buy these lands at once. I can get them for almost nothing. When the water comes in,it'll be worth a fortune. Sell everything you can and send me money." Corkscrew, we gotta help him. A noble thought, young lady. But where will we get the money? Well, and what do you want me to do? Find the money, man. That's why you were the administrator. Well, you are-- you are askingme to steal from Don Pedro? To embezzlement? You think I'm capable of that? Yes. Help us, Alejandro. Here. Take these. Sell them. Then send the money toAndre, but don't tell him that it's from me. Add all the money you oweme and send it to the kid. If that's the way you feel, I could send him the money Don Pedro owes me. Well, what are youwaiting for, pencil pusher? [laughing] [phone ringing] Hello. [scoffing] Simon. Simon! Simon, I don't know what thehell you're talking about. I don't understand whyall of a sudden my winery is being turned upside down. Simon, look, I left you in charge. I gave you specific instructions. Instructions so simpleany idiot can follow them. That's all you have to do some, just follow them. Do it! Michael, you have to comeback at once and take charge. I can't reach your father in Jerez. What the hell does myfather have to do with it? I'm the general manager. I give the orders. Look, I don't want anythingdone until I get back. Is that clear? Don't decant the wine. Don't do one single thinguntil I'm there to supervise. You understand? [slams phone] I told you, they're are a bunch of idiots. You better be careful, darling. They could be trying to set a trap for you, trying to blame you fora mistake they've already made. We should go back. Well, maybe you're right. I got your message. Is it really that serious? It couldn't be worse. Well, I'm sorry, butit's none of my business. My father gave theresponsibility to my brother. Let him decide. Julia! Don't get mixed up in this, Corkscrew. But I'm going to. Then you can do what you want. It is your family winery, Julia. And the harvest is in danger. Turn your back on your father now and he will never forgive you. And you know what he will say? That you refused to helpjust to spite your brother. Damn you, Corkscrew! Is there no way to shut you up. None that I know of. [huffs] I've never seen anything like it. I'm afraid neither have I. Let me have a taste. [spits] Julia, what the hell are you doing here? All right, what's going on? I can answer that, Michael. You've arrived just in time to be congratulated for superb harvest of vinegar. He's right. There is an underground river. More water than youcould use in 1,000 years. This land is priceless. My men have confirmed the existence of your underground river. And so we are willing tobuy all the land you own. Not interested. Oh, then we would-- Now this area is potentially too rich to be completely given up. It has to be developed properly. And no doubt you've alwaysthought of the best way to do that. Right. First, form a corporation inwhich I retain a 60% interest. Second, turn this desert into a paradise. There is plenty of water. And third, design something unique, giant parcels for the wealthy. And afterwards, as soonas you're ready, we'll sign. Nice and legal. This check is in the amount agreed upon equal to the value of 49% of the stock in your corporation. Don't your eyes dancewhen they see so many zeros. This is only the beginning, gentlemen. There's going to be more.Much more. I'll buy it. This vineyard has been the dream of my family for many generations, a dreamof a perfect white wine, young and so flawless italready has a name, Fine Gold. Don't ask me why, but the grapeshave to come from this place. Here it is at last, the beginning. This may also be the end, the end of a dream as it becomes reality. But father I don't understandhow they let it happen. I thought that they-- You thought. You thought. Nobody asked you to think, Michael. Just to let the men who know what to do do it. Yes, but they didn't explain it clearly. Oh my god, on top of everything else, you blame it on somebody else? They wanted to change procedure. Because they were facinga disaster and you stupidly interfered. What do you expect, a medal? My god. I thought everything was going to be all right when I came home. I'd finally persuaded the bankers to save the palace in Jerez. How did you manage that? With the collateral, of course. You don't mean the harvest? Yes, the harvest. But a harvest of wine, not vinegar. Oh, my god. Now that you own thelargest winery in Europe, what do you plan to do with it? Make it bigger. Please don't go in. Who are those men? Is something wrong my father? Answer me. They're from the casinos. They came to collect your brother's debts? How much? Under the circumstances,any amount is too much. That damn good for nothing! He won't be happy until he's ruined us. You haven't heard everything. There's worse to come. There's something worse? Yes. Those men told your fatherthat Michael had already paid a gambling debt some time ago. It was during the time that themoney was missing from the safe and about the same amount. Damn him! I told you that Andrecould never steal from us, but no one believed me. Wait. This isn't the time to see the Don. The devil himself couldn't stop me. No please go. Father. You know? Poor Andre. I'll never forgive myself. I-- but what was I to think? I couldn't believe my own son? I must get my car. [coughing] Can I even take a lap without you screaming? What do you want? Nothing. And I am not drunk. Don Miguel is entering the main gate. I told you never to come here again. I came to apologize. Please. First, I want to return the money you gave me. Next , I'm going to make a public announcement as to your son's innocence. And last, I want to apologizeto both you and your son and humbly beg your forgiveness. Miguel, this is my check. That's right. You've held it all this time? Never cashed it? Why? I was ashamed. I knew one day I'd have toreturn it, so there it is. You're a damned honorable man, Miguel. I'm as damned andhonorable as you are, Pedro. Call my son at once. No. What did you say? I said no. I won't call him. You'll do as I tell you. No because as usual you are wrong. Andre will come back sooner than you think to straighten things out. But he will come when he decides. He's not a dog to call when you will. You damned old fool, areyou hiding something from me? Yes. And it's wonderful news. But perhaps a little toostrong for your weak heart. You get back here. Get back here, goddammit. [grumbles] I said get back here! [grumbles] You miserable excuse for a man. To steal from your own fatherand then blame it on Andre. I'll never forgive you. Father, I already explained to you. I had to. Had to? You had to? Not only have you possiblyruined me, but what is worse, you've disgraced our family name. Well, then I'll go to Don Pedro and apologize. I've already gone there. Well, then what can I do? Do. I tell you what you can do. You can get out of my house and don't come back until you are a man. A man with some sense of decency. Please, Father. Go and pack and get out. You disgust me. Father, I am sorry. You're sorry? You're really sorry? I don't believe you. Get out. Yes, sir. Simon! Where the hell is he going in my car? Your car? You father just gave it to Simon! Son of a bitch! What the hell's going on anyway! Ah, the old man, hekicked me out of the house. But don't worry. I'll figure something out. Oh, will you really, darling? Well, you're gonnafigure it out without me. Where you going? Who knows, but I have no intention of being a poor man's widow. [knocking] May I come in, Don Miguel? Yes, come in. What can I do for you? I know you think I was abad influence on your son, but it's not true. Really? Well, yes. From the very beginning, I tried to stop him from drinking so much. And I begged him not to gamble,but he wouldn't listen to me. Well, that's verythoughtful of you, Stella. But he's so young, and the young men never listen to reason do they? Now that's true. Well, that's why I prefer much older men, intelligent men of the world. Well, like-- Like-- like me? Oh, yes. Men who've succeeded in life, men who've had experiences with women. You know. Like me? Exactly like you. Mmm hmm. And these men, they should be rich, no? Oh, no. That's not important. Money doesn't interest me. Oh, no. Of course not. Excuse me. It's a mature mind that counts. I mean with a man like that,girl can feel safe, secure. I've always dreamed aboutmeeting a man like that. Now. And you think that Icould fit into that dream? Oh, yes. Oh, I've dreamed of you so many times, Miguel. About your large, powerfulbody, your aquiline nose, ooh, your distinguished white hair. For me, you are very sexy, Miguel. Truly? And do you think that youcould fit into my life? Of course, Miguel. Trust me. It would be wonderful. I could make you sohappy, you can't imagine. Mmm hmm. Would you do something,something very special for me? Yes, my darling. Anything. Just tell me what you want. Anything. Everything. Just tell me. Tell me. Would you-- Yes? Would you get the hell out of my house, you horrible lying little cowbefore I smack your bottom! Go on! [laughing] My god. She-- The centrifuge is good. But get rid of these mixtures.I'm not impressed. They are very good was ones. Very good is not good enough. I want the best. Don't you realize whatthey're going to control? Fine Gold. I have only one regret, that you didn't come to me from the first moment. Well, I don't like to use my friends. What are friends for? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. First, I'll instruct mybank to pay off the mortgage on your palace in Jerez. What? What can I say? And then I'll give you whatever you need to make your contracts. Do you know how much thatis translated into dollars? Many zeros. But they taught me in schoolwith many zeros mean nothing. Not to me. How can I repay you? Who knows? But the happiness of our children has no price. Don't you agree? Don't look so sad, Julia. My father will take care of everything. Father, I've made up my mind. Oh, no, no, no, no, I absolutely refuse to let you marry. You don't love Charlie. You couldn't. Anyway I thought of you and Andre-- That was over a long time ago. Are you sure? You always seemed so happy together. It doesn't matter to me. But it does matter. You think I could be happyknowing that you're not happy? I'll manage. Besides, it's the only way out of this mess. I can't stand by and watchyou lose everything knowing that I could have prevented it. No, Julia. I've had my life. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Does it really matter if I lose the vineyard? It matters to me. Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Tell Don Roberto to announce our engagement. Oh, Julia. Telegram, sir. Pack my luggage. I'm going to Rioja. Is that you, Andre? Yes, Father. I've been waiting for you. I'm here. Did you get what you wanted? Yes. I'm told that you've build houses? Is that true? Well, yes. So you've become a bricklayer. Is that what you wanted? No. I am the son and grandson of winemakers. And I've never stopped being one. Papa, do you remember thevineyards of Viterone? How could I ever forget? I shall die dreaming ofit just as my father did. A grape of fine gold. They are ours. What? I bought them and theneighboring vineyards as well. Ah, you've come home to torture me. No, no. The deeds to the propertyare in your name and mine. So don't die. Die? The hell's thinking about dying? The doctor told me-- That quack! He'd like to keep me going on drugs so he could finance a yacht for himself. Do you realize how much work we have to do? Find out where that man Corkscrew's hiding. Don Pedro, I am here. I'm here. Now you get Alejandro. Alejandro. Alejandro. Wait 'til he hears about this. He'll croak! [laughing] The vineyards of Bitherhoneare my god I see it, but I don't believe it. And you why are you standingthere looking like an idiot? Move! Move! [laughing] Congratulations, children. This is the happiest day of my life. If you want this marriage to take place, take Julia to Jerez right away. Why? Andre is back. We have the finest vineyards,the largest winery in Europe. But is there any money left? Oh, I don't know. Take a look. [whistles] Mother of mercy! How is it possible to acquire somuch money in so short a time? With a little divine help,no magic, and the little rod made from an ash tree. Does Julia know I'm here? Mmm I don't think so. Tell her I want to see her. Uhhh, that would not be easy. Why not? Because early this morning,everybody left for Jerez. Who is everybody? Umm, Julia, herfather, Don Roberto, uh-- Why did Don Roberto's family go with them? Corkscrew, come on. Tell me what's going on. Better you should hearfrom me than somebody else . Julia and Charlie are going to be married. I told you not to decorate it. Now take off the ruffles. DRESSMAKER: All of them? Yes! And the ones in the back and that ridiculous bow. It's the latest style. I still don't like it. I want the simplest weddingdress that you ever made. I've got a reputation to protect, and you want to look likea Kennedy for a convent! Do as I say. I don't care. One more fitting and that's it. Only one more fitting! Impossible! What are you doing here? Get in. Come in. Take me home. I will later. I hear that you're for sale. Who are you to judge me? You don't love Charlie. I know it. You're only marrying him to save your father. Well, the hell with your sacrifice! I'll save him, even Michael if necessary. It's too late. Julia, I love you. I've loved you every day of my life. And now I've done what I set out to do. I fought and gambled and I made a fortune. And I'm offering it to you. Oh, Andre. Call Charlie. Tell him to come here. Hello. Julia! Where have you been? We're all worried about you. Has something happened. No, I'm all right. I have to see you right away. Where are you. The farmhouse at the Viterone vineyards. Do you know where it is? Yes. I'll be waiting for you. Why did I do that? Because you don't love him. Because you never loved him. And because you always knewthat one day, you'd be my wife. Charlie, I'm sorry. I can't marry you. I'm not in love with you. You love someone else? Yes. Have you considered what itmeans, breaking our engagement? Yes. The money would save my family. That's why I agreed to marryyou in the first place, and it was dishonest. I see. I appreciate your honesty. And, well, I wish you the best, both of you. I've always loved you, Julia. It won't be easy to forget you. I'm sorry. Goodbye. I thought you would take it harder. You didn't tell him anythinghe didn't already know. He knew the role he hadto play and he played it. And now what? Well, first, we pay all yourfather's debts plus purchase the mortgage on his palace. And then we make you directorgeneral of all his wineries. I warn you. I'll be your biggest competitor. I like competition. [knocking] Remember me? You'd be hard to forget. Come in. What do you want, Stella? We have something in common,a little unfinished business. Yeah? What? Tell me. Do you like playing the fool, getting the dirty end of the stick? No. Then why don't we join forces? A complete union? Why not? With pleasure. Every little bit helps. There he is. Those tanks, are they're well protected? Nah. When the tanks break, thedirt will spoil the wine. No problem. The walls, are they strong? The walls, normal like any other wall. In a few days more, thewalls they all fall down. [sinister laughing] Satisfied? You sure have some strange friends. You have to fight fire with fire. And flame with flame. No, darling, flame on flame. [explosions] OK, what's the bad news? Over $50 million. It's good hit. We're not finished yet. Andre-- What now? I buy more juice to replace the loss, and this time make sure nothing happens. But where are we going to get the money? Don't worry. I'll get it. The amount you've asked for is staggering. Your fortune is solid,but it's not without menace. What collateral do you need? All 51% of the stock in your corporation. Might as well be everything. It is. You have nothing else. If you did, I'd ask for that as well. The certificates arein my safety deposit box. I know, but, um-- But? You mean that's not enough? A direct questiondeserves a direct answer. No, it is not. There's nothing else? You're wrong. There is something else. Excuse me, Andre. I couldn't help but overhear. Here are the deeds to my palace. That should be sufficient. No, Don Miguel, I won't let you risk it. I know what it means to you? I don't mean that as security. I'm willing to sell. That should cover everything. It's not necessary to go that far. But I'll accept it as a guaranty. I know my client. And I'm quite certain thathe'll get whatever he wants. [chuckles] You see? Oh, ho, ho, ho, Don Pedro. You did it! No, no, Corkscrew. We! [laughing] It's a boy? It's a boy! A boy! [laughing]
