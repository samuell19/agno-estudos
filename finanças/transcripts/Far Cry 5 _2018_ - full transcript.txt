renovating my wife and i had rented a a condominium nearby and my daughter was going to be with us for just a little bit and then she was going to go away to um to camp and then covet hit and you know what we thought was going to be this uh sort of very laissez-faire existence with just my wife and i chilling in this condo ended up the boys both moved back in with us they were sleeping in two mattresses in the den my daughter had a bedroom bedroom so for six months we were just like one big family yeah and i didn't i didn't think that we would have that experience as a family again and it was intense and it was also uh it was incredible to get to have that time together one one sort of one last opportunity to be this um yeah be this sort of family unit uh in the same way that we had been i don't know uh so yeah it was pretty great how about things for you i'll tell you what we've we were in a lot of lockdowns here in melbourne australia so we're finally out of them now and uh

you weren't born out of toronto were you i was born in a place called winnipeg which is a smaller city in the prairies yeah middle of middle of canada yes so toronto is um is home now winnipeg was where i was born in new york we spent that's where we we had our first that's where we had dempsey the oldest one and where i went to theater school so we spent some time in new york as well lived in new york yeah so i want to i want to touch on this amazing character that you got to play in far cry or far cry series i mean man what a role tell us all about it so it was uh that was a strange uh strange occurrence they um i i was not familiar with video games the world of video games how far i could come like when i was a kid i played like the commodore 64 and i had and uh i had an uh you know i had an atari and stuff so like video games were this strange world and i had never done one and they i guess were looking for someone to play the father the ubisoft people dan hay who's the creative director of the franchise the far cry franchise and that game and drew holmes who was the lead writer and they couldn't find anybody they couldn't find someone they wanted so they the casting in toronto reached out to my agent and and to gauge my interest and i said absolutely not like i'm not doing a video game like i didn't i i'm like well like what are you well like what what is that and you know i got a bunch of movies and tv shows and that was my world and i and they said well would you read uh like the monologue would you read some some of the writing so they sent they sent um the the model that ended up playing in the game where um my wife were young and pregnant and terrified of becoming a father that was the monologue they they um sent me and of course myself getting my girlfriend at the time pregnant when we were 22 to turning 23 and being unprepared for fatherhood and terrified it just like it got yeah yeah and and and it was so um i mean the writing is so dark but but very beautiful and very human and so i went in and i walked in there the director guy named david footy who um is a wonderful director for the game uh i i sat down at a table i did the monologue once uh and then i just got up and walked out and he just sort of tried to stop me at the door but that was like that was it and he sent it to dan and dan hey really responded to it and i had a quick phone meeting uh with them and they then they flew me out to montreal where the ubisoft studios were and i sat down with uh with dan and drew and js who's another one of the um was one of the writers in the game and they walked me through the world and this character and i was blown away and from what started as me saying no um it has been one of the great adventures artistically of my life the the character i mean as an actor that's all you want you want an interesting well-written character in a project that people care about and the people at ubisoft we're as passionate about this about the storytelling um as as any film or television show i've ever been on the the talent of the writing the the the how extraordinary it was challenged me in a way that few other things have it almost felt shakespearean at times and then to see that the artistry of the the programmers and you you know we would they would film it so you've got the camera in your face and i can see the performance and it's not unlike in a movie where they've got the you know you're in the volume with the dots but then the camera's right in your face and to see how exactly they captured not just like the details of the performance but you know what i don't want something flaky but almost the soul of it like they caught the life of what i was doing oh yeah they captured every detail of your face yeah it was just i was so proud of of of all of it that is the collaboration between all of us to create this really unsettling world and character that you know that the the the fan base the community the far cry community has been so receptive yeah to and appreciative of and it's it's been a blessing all the way through it's just been incredible i tell you what you knocked it out of the park in my mind i always i was stunned once the credits closed i mean you just knocked it out of the park some of those monologues straight to the cat straight to the player straight to the camera they go on for like four minutes that's not normal for a game to to have that much confidence in their villain actor whoever it is to just do a straight monologue with nothing else going on yeah it was really interesting they um again i had because i had never done been involved in a game i i had no um i have no other point of reference like so this was my one work experience and they were so um accommodating to the process of of of finding the work like a lot of times you work in a very big open space and and as an actor that it's hard it's it feels strange so they would for those monologues they would create like they would build little shelters around me almost so that it was a much more intimate uh environment and felt very connected and also a lot of the times i would deliver it right to not to a camera but there was a another actor who has a camera on their face as well so i was actually able to connect with another person and do those but those last the big monologues at the end the the i mean it's been not long enough but this when my siblings each at the the eulogies for each of my siblings yeah we were um we were shooting uh amazon had we did a movie called inside eden's gate which was like the a live action version of far cry it's shooting it up in in montana where the game is set and i and there was um massive forest fires at the time and it was my last day of shooting out in montana and we we were shooting the game in between like you know you do a week here a week there gap yeah and drew wrote those final eulogies and i remember getting them uh in the morning and i was going to be looking at them so we were shooting and the the i'm in the mountains like in the hills of montana yeah the fire all around me the sky is blood red you can smell smoke and i'm learning these speeches these monologues and it was the most incredible experience of like being there and feeling bad and then we came back and we shot those in one afternoon and um eulogies yeah we said we stock them in an afternoon um and that you know we did uh we did the first we did uh uh you know jacob and john and faith and they were all you know they were all emotional and they all sort of had what was needed and then we were getting to the last one and we did it once and it was good but there was just something the implosion of a person just coming in on it just wasn't it wasn't quite there and and and then the interesting thing about the shooting in the the one space in in toronto we're shooting is there's a train a subway that goes past every once in a while and it'll wreck the take so you kind of like right so you wow every once in a while just saying that's okay you do it again so i asked them for i asked them for a moment and it was just everyone was incredibly still and there was just there's something in my own life that just dropped in and everyone could feel it and i sat down and that happened with the snot and everything and it finished and it was dead silence and then the train went past now again the entire that's good dan hey who was there said that he was praying during the entire speech please please don't play the train no train no train no train and that was again i've been blessed with some to work on some great films and uh some great television shows and had some wonderful writing and characters to play but that that that's that stuff is up there with anything i've ever had the problem doing so you actually you actually got emotional and the snot actually came out oh a hundred percent oh wow oh oh no i was like that was i've gone to some dark places in film that was and it was interesting because like yes the snot was coming out of my mouth and i was just destroyed and dan looked to the the renderers they were there and he's like all of that goes in the game that's all of that don't you don't make it prettier you don't make it a gross and heartbroken and destroying being all of that goes in the game so that snot was exactly if you took a side by side of me doing the performance on camera and what you see in the game is that is it is invented nothing denied nothing v says the last crying scene was breathtaking i think yeah i think i'm not the only one who thinks that that was and it was crazy to me that you weren't i don't know were you nominated for many awards for that for the game that that just that blows my mind that actually blows my mind it was it was uh i got i mean look that's not why you do it but i kind of thought you sometimes you know when you have created something special and you're part of something special and it's just like i mean the writing was so great and there was just so many opportunities for real true human emotion and he was so like there was such an arc in the character like the charisma and the the seductiveness of the sermons and stuff and then watching him come up watching me come apart but yeah there was uh uh he it did not um there was a couple like i got nominated for like a game stop thing but like the bigger ones didn't acknowledge it but you know that's crazy and there's a lot a lot of people played that game and enjoyed it so um i was proud of it so has it has it changed your life would you say well well yes it has um the the gaming community is is vast and and extraordinarily supportive and engaged um i really i i think that the people that i have met through it have been incredible the game itself like just you know that when they were promoting far cry 5 they they took me out to uh they had built us like essentially a cult outpost in san francisco and they flew me in on the helicopter to give a little like all of that stuff wasn't really was that a pr um activity yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i've seen lunch so that was like all of that was incredible getting to shoot the little movie was incredible and it's the game was so popular and did so well that to be part of something uh like blockbustery was was exciting and and also the relationships working with uh with those people uh and the friendships that started like dan and drew and i are still you know we stay in contact and look for other things to work on together and i just have a lot of respect for the artists that are involved in that world and but the the the the storytelling aspect of it there's just some is it's really it's incredible as an actor to get to sink your teeth into that stuff did you know how big far cry was before it came out no i um no i hadn't again like i i really like i i'm almost i should pretend i'm not as ignorant as i am i had no idea i knew that michael mando is also from toronto well from canada who played voss yeah right so i knew him and knew of him because he was like this guy well i didn't know him but like there was this guy like all my friend you know actors know each other like oh my god there's this kid he's amazing and friends we'd have you know we had at a bar we'd drink it you got it this kid this michael man blah blah blah yeah so i started to research him a little bit and then the voss stuff came up so i knew that um i knew that he was crazy and awesome as an actor and the character looked really interesting um and that i knew kind of far cry had and then troy as um as pegmin uh was also you know excellent i didn't i didn't know him but i've met him and he's super talented and you look at his resume he's like done every amazing video game ever um but that they have a they have a um they do villains very well the far cry so friends be a part of that is was pretty pretty special and what do you think of far cry 6 um who they've got over there now yeah well i've seen that do you i've seen the trailer and stuff it looks amazing and giancarlo who's brilliant i did um obviously i loved him from breaking bad and i did a series with him for hbo last year called jet so i got to work yeah i had worked with him and didn't realize that he was doing far cry 6. um see he's wonder he's a wonderful actor and that that game's going to be spectacular and he's going to be he's destroying of course he's just he's a brilliant actor and they write so well and they care so much about the worlds they create that it's i'm sure it's gonna be breathtaking and i mean i think you're the first far cry villain to come back a second time so that's when you know that you knocked it out because you were in um new dawn as well yeah yeah which was really it was uh it was really nice to get to revisit the character later you know you sort of see what happened we often imagine like what will our lives look like 20 years from whatever and and to have to get to revisit the father after all that he's been through and then you know with with ethan with my son another really emotional moment with you know losing my son so to to i worked very i trained in new york sort of as a method actor i worked very personally so to to to go to that oh yeah and and so that go through the experience of losing my son uh was another really really tricky scene to do but but uh you know plays plays really well so so when you say method acting when you when you come to set do you you stay away from others and you just go in your bubble or how does it how does it work for you i you know what i i'm gonna i'm not one of the i'm not an actor who is like call me the father while i'm on set or or um you know like i'm gonna be you know when i'm at home my family has to call me by the character i'm playing's name but but because uh but i i work very i work very personally like i'll um you know all all of my i'll just you know i'll get myself in a place where you know through music required and i'll just you know uh imagine we're all gonna say goodbye to our loved ones at some point and i love my kids a great deal and i know at some point i'm going to be lying on a bed and they're going to come to say goodbye or god forbid i'm you know i'm not you know you imagine having to bury one of them speaking you know like you saw oh [ __ ] upon me i'll mess with myself to the place where i'm going to experience something real it's not like i'm there and that that's a talent though not everyone can do that get to that place well it is a gift that it is a you know i think a lot of actors have a lot of different things that they can bring to the thing and i that's a place that i can go i i've been i can access uh some dark reservoirs in myself and i've i figured out i think that a nice thing is because we i had we had a baby when i was in theater school so i've had to learn i've got friends who work in it you know they can't turn it off but i always had to like i had to learn to work and then come home and read goodnight moon and tuck my kids in and make dinner and help out and like they there was not i didn't i wasn't able to indulge a lot of the self-destructive behavior that happens with active because you do you upset yourself and and the subconscious doesn't really distinguish between a real experience and a vividly imagined experience um so i've learned how to work when i have to and um and i find that the game no difference than a film set that people know what kind of scene is coming and there's usually there's a lot of quiet on set and people just work very um respectfully around you because they know that you're in a like you feel that you're in a place where where it's gonna get you know where you need to be evolved yeah yeah and you need to be um you're gonna have this cathartic moment so they don't want to distract you so much so and i think part of it it's funny like i i i tell my kids because you know one of the things that you you learn through experience is that first of all i enjoy people and i love the process of filmmaking game making television but be really kind to people all the time go out of your way on the good days to be super polite and super nice because there are gonna be days when you're gonna need to not be an ass but where you're gonna need to be like i'm now in i need to put a little bit of space around myself because i'm gonna go to someplace in my i'm gonna be burying my daughter in my mind for three hours leading up to the scene because i need to know that when that camera rolls and they need me to fall off a cliff that i can do that so you know but if you're if you're an ass all the time or you're last yet on people then it's you know then it's unpleasant so be be kind all the time but also know that when you have to work you you need to do whatever you need to do for you to to get there whatever there is and you could an audience whether it be in a game or whether it be on a television where they can that you feel if it's real or or if they're you know doing a trick and i think that we respect i do as an audience member respect the performers that really put themselves in emotional harm's way so to speak yeah muhammad says question greg what scene was the most difficult to film big fan i'm guessing it was the one we just talked about would you say yeah that was i mean that was it was it was both difficult because you know it but it was also really gratifying um some of the stuff the bigger um the sermon scenes with moving pieces was an interesting yeah was technically difficult because you're it's all everything gets shot is like in a one take and then because they have to so you can't break and so some of those long long speeches and movements like it all has to play because it's not like in a film where they're gonna they can cut out of this and then cut to a reaction from you and back and you can i mean filmmaking can be in snippets like snip snips this is it all plays at all it all rolls so technically to be you know to play within the world and to be to get everything right and with all the moving pieces and stuff that was there was there was definitely challenges as an actor but they were so supportive and really created an environment to do good work which as as an actor you're always grateful for yeah um greg love your work have you played the game before yeah yeah badly uh yeah yeah sure and it was funny because when the game for my kids are better at video games than uh than i am and when the game first came out they had sent me a copy and and my kids were downstairs and my wife uh they were quite a bad i mean it's been a few years ago my daughter was actually playing she's like my wife was like it's time for bed and she's like i'm trying to kill dad and my brain it's okay take a little bit more time so yeah i've played i i'm not good at all um but yeah the games uh you know we've played it we have this you know they're part of their um they had a statue made of for one of the collector's editions the father edition of the game so i have a couple of statues of me as the father which was really yeah what that statue i never it's pretty neat yeah it was like i said the whole thing was a bit if you they make you feel good like it you know it's a acting's a fun life it's a hard life too there's a lot of ups and downs there's a lot of there's a lot more no's than yeses and you know um but there's moments that you just feel beyond the work it feels nice and they too that you they take really good care they took really good care of me and the fans again were so great and and and the success of the game was really uh rewarding as well to know that a lot of people liked it and enjoyed it and and people found it spoke to them in a way yeah i think particularly now we're in a very strange time with uh you know connectivity through social media and screens and stuff but yet the sense of like tactile family is fraying a bit and the father was so much about like the like love those that are with you and and the sense of community and family i think resonated with people um so it was a very it was very interesting i think that it had a i think beyond the game play and the thrill of a villain and stuff i think the message is complicated and resonated with people in a way did you did you find that anyone know like recognized you after this rock because it does look like you a lot like it's well they bought my face yeah they really do yeah ubisoft had never done that before but they that's another thing that dan hey and again i i can't speak more highly of a person i just think he's such a wonderful artist and a great leader um but he when they cast me insisted that they bought my face what do you mean what do you mean by that exactly so like a lot of times the characters will look similar to the actor but they they actually bought my face so they paid me a licensing fee and then they took a license oh yes that's right so they fly me and then they flew me out and they mapped my face exactly so that the character would look exactly uh like me and um yeah i mean they didn't still a canadian actor and i mean it wasn't like they paid me a fortune but they bought my face yeah it was really neat so when you and particularly some of the cinematic scenes it's it's striking how how much i can recognize myself in it so what did you what did you do when you first saw the game come out and there's cut scenes what was your reaction to yourself i would i was thrilled with how well it came across and it was interesting because and i again i thought so like the day before the game or two days before the game came out i don't know how this happens someone on youtube had cut together all my scenes it's probably me because yeah because i i had the game early so that helps but so i was able to watch as like i think it was like 47 minutes of cinematics yeah of the fall i remember doing that i watched it and i was so i was i was proud because i thought that as like just as an acting as a character i thought wow like i'm proud of this work but i was also so grateful for the talent of the people doing the computer generated imaging like to do that to catch not just not just again not just like the the the shape of it but to catch the soul of what was happening i know there's a vocal recording so it's actual but something in the eyes they managed to catch a little bit of crazy and a little bit of life in the eyes that was yeah very human it was i it was a recognizably human experience watching that greg uh this is from stalker how did greg get along with the other actors from the seed family um great they were all i mean so it was i i've spent a day with each of them and um uh it's not long is it no no no like it was because it's just you know there's um not long to hang out with your son for a day you know no with no no it's not and you know with so i had a day with each of them and they were all i mean they're just incredibly talented and it was amazing to find these familial relationships and create them with each other um and and then i've never seen them since you know so it's just the other strange thing was the actors who played the characters in the game were not the same actors that were in the movie um the amazon movie so you're the only one i was the only one and again that was dan again insisted they couldn't do it unless they they they used me um and um so it was yeah so it was pretty again there was i i have not a single not not even negative every experience was incredible the whole everyone involved every aspect of it felt very uh satisfying and well cared for like all of you could just see the passion for creating great games a great experience for the player and that mattered i remember making a video it was like the montana in the game versus the real life montana and so many people after after playing are like now i want to go to montana it's so beautiful beautiful so beautiful yeah even jericho he says far cry 5 makes me want to go to montana it really they did an astounding job on it dan and they went and lived in montana they spent time with a couple of yeah they spent some time with some cults and militia groups [ __ ] like to like immerse themselves in it and i it is kind of a funny montana story uh and how much of an idiot i am so when i flew out there to shoot this uh from toronto flew out to montana and i get out of the airport and my driver's waiting for me and it's like smells amazing like big montana fresh air and i put a little bit of seed when i'm like oh my god it smells amazing and it goes that's our state burning because i was in the midst of like those awful foreign like a little bit like a fire or like fresh air how do you respond to that yeah i'm gonna just i'm just like hi i'm greg i'm gonna sit in the car and i'm gonna be really quiet for the rest of the drive thank you very much that is brilliant um i've got more questions here greg deserves a an award for his fantastic work life of gunther jericho agrees i will give the award to greg fantastic work thanks thank you his performance changed me now i think of his voice and lines when i do stuff when i'm being mocked i think of the lines you are all special and you are all smart hear them in outposts wow that's for privateer it's been very interesting because all alone at times in our life like there's moments where we just and some more than others and i think we all want to be seen or feel loved or feel understood i think that's part of the human condition i mean we're we're animals that that that gather in families and tribes and groups and and in the modern world it's hard it's harder because you know your jobs take you everywhere and again we have this gift of technology which connects us in a way but but also there's always that a barrier between so i think that for um a lot of things the father said beyond like like the crazy apocalypse stuff i believe myself like the idea of family the idea of community so i was speaking from a real honest place and i think that it it clearly resonated with some people that that there was a sense of some of the most touching interactions i've had i don't do a lot of conventions but i've been to a couple and you know people that maybe had difficult relationships with their own parents or their own father or just felt a little bit lost in life and and that i've been able to to reach out and be supportive to on social media and just like in a small small way but it seems to make a difference in people's lives to be acknowledged and to be seen to be encouraged and that's been um that's been a special part of this as well privateer says hi greg i've got a question how was your interactions with john and jacob's actors did you work face to face in your scenes greetings from denmark we just touched on that a little bit yeah there's one funny moment that there's a scene with the scene with john when we like i i like i like i i like touching as a thing but with you got the cameras on your head so it makes it a little tricky so you can't really get too close can you no so you're like there's a moment where we i touch heads or foreheads with my brothers how do you do that like i really wanted to do that but we had to figure out like how so we would like slide our heads just past each other and then they'd line it up in the game but it was it was kind of weird but um but yeah but the same that that need to to to touch to connect to whatever was uh between these brothers were lost and it's such a beautiful and haunting backstory of this family that's been torn apart and separated and you know jacob went off the war and john had his problems and i was in you know the in the orpha an orphan in the system and abused and then for them to find each other again and just sort of and then faith um not being a blood relation but but as part of the family this sense of of us um the sense of relying on each other and and people building being willing to sacrifice everything for you was uh you know it's again it's a as as misguided as obviously some of it is there's still a great warmth to the story of love there's it's a love story between a family on some level you know you're making me want to play it again uh um reece says greg was amazing in history of violence oh yeah thanks that's that's going back isn't it yeah that started that that really started my career in uh in in a meaningful way because you know i was kicking around i had i you know we had a couple of kids and it was it's hard just my career as an actor took a minute to get going and i was not providing for my family in the way that i needed to and and and that the um you know i was playing like the young guy with the suit the cocky went like he just didn't quite nothing was you know like you were kind of like just real i think it was substance and it just hadn't broken through in any meaningful way and then i um i had i did this i went and i read for this short film um and i played this my [ __ ] like a really dark violent guy and the audition for it was uh i was awful like off book just an awful human being and the casting is casting director of that when they were casting history of islands um was the assisting deirdre bowen who was the casting agent for this movie does a lot of cronenberg's films and they were looking for a young guy to play billy in that in that movie and they were looking all over the place and millie this castle assistant said oh you have to look at greg brick for this part and they was like no like the i you know i was like the kind of cute preppy guy in the thing like and she's like trust me he's a mess so they brought me in i i this was 2005 earlier earlier to 2000 and my daughter yeah yeah 2004. does it for you 2003 actually maybe shooting in 2003 came out in 2004. um around there and uh and i didn't i i put myself on tape and uh and david cronenberg liked it and the studios were really they wanted him to flesh out those first two characters it ended up being me and a guy named stephen mcaddy who we did 13 movies and tv shows together over the next five years after that came out he's crazy if he was in it if i was in it he was in it it was it was funny wow but they wanted originally and this is they the studio wanted philip seymour hoffman to play my part and tom waits to play mccaddy's part because they're like the odd the first eight minutes of the movie is a camera following me around and they're like the audiences they when they need to see somebody so they were gonna like beef that part up a little bit more and they wanted philip seymour hoffman and uh cronenberg said the audience can't know these guys like violence it's like that danger has to be like just the guy walking down the street you don't know yeah you know and he goes it's and he fought for it he fought to get me in that movie and it obviously you know was so critically acclaimed and whatever and then and then the this the kind of the american studio system was like oh we know what to do with him now make him a bad guy in everything so then i did shoot him up with clivo and paul giamatti and he was you know it was i played a lot of shades of evil a real rogues gallery over the next couple of decades really um but it is fun to play it's amazing it's amazing look i i try to be a a decent a good father and a good husband and i'm very like i lead a very contained existence but when like i walk the kids to school and i bake cupcakes and i volunte i'm like i'm a good good dad good guy been married for 25 years but when they say action i just some something goes something goes wrong and i it's well you know what it is imagine like you go to the zoo when you see the animals and they're like oh isn't that cute but like if the door opened and the light you know that's what myself i don't censor myself and i whatever whatever impulse hits my body yeah uh this works its way out onto that screen so it's been very therapeutic and and it's you know it's provided a life for my family and i still get to play i would never say like good guys but less bad guys and complicated leading men in some more independent stuff but but i i i enjoy making monsters human i like that i like that what was your thoughts on far cry new dawn from chem80 i i um i thought that it was a really interesting idea um i liked i loved being playing the father again uh it was because it wasn't it was sort of it's a bit of a smaller game obviously or right expansion yeah so it was i mean i'm not sure that i'm not sure how like it was i mean it wasn't as big or as popular a game but i still think that the people involved were were really good i loved getting to be the father again oh yeah um and and reconnect with the audience as the father and also just get to explore some different shades of it so it was again it was a positive experience far cry 5 was still um i think creating yeah was yeah was it was a much more it was a much fuller experience for me this was just i did went out to montreal for a couple of days and did you know new dawn um whereas far cry 5 spread out over a much bigger time so did you ever did you ever do any voice acting or was everything you did motion capture performance capture it was uh all performance capture except for some of the stuff you hear on the radio we recorded some stuff on the radio and um and more more actually for new dawn because you see there was a few sessions because he fights and stuff like everything was cinematic to the father in in in uh five so we were able to film it all as if we really felt like i was doing a movie it's just a bit strange or a play or something but yeah so a little bit more voice like in the booth work for um new dawn but not not a huge amount uh so it felt it's funny when people say like i love your like the voice acting in it i don't really like it takes me like oh yeah yeah yeah i understand because i guess a lot of it is done traditionally in a booth but for me it was all done on camera with the microphone on it was no different than doing a movie for me in a lot of ways yeah robin says love your work greg i was just wondering would you ever do another video game if the opportunity arised sure yeah i i think that my eyes have been open to that world and um there's some great there's some i mean it's just it's a it's a rich and growing art form and i think it's i gotta be honest i think it's only gonna get big bigger and it's gonna be like there's the gaming aspect of it but the storytelling aspect like this is us uh is that the last of us last about story party yeah and uh red dead uh red dead redemption yeah my kids played that a lot like i just think that the the storytelling the characters they're creating are amazing so as an actor um i'm always looking for a good character and i'm always looking for a challenge so yes for sure i would um for the right right type of project i would love to love to work in that medium again have you been approached surely you like no everyone knows you like i know it's that's insane to me what's going on yeah it's very real yeah no i've only other than those two uh the far cry you've never been approached yeah it's just insane yeah i i mean i can't mind guys approach this man i thought that more that there would be more of that like i mean those experiences were amazing and i've done like a lot of film and tv since then so it's not like i've been sitting on waiting but i i kind of thought well okay this was a huge game and the character was compelling that you would but it's no there hasn't been wow yeah interesting uh tt says i absolutely love the father i would join eden's kate thanks i've heard that a few times we'll see maybe maybe maybe maybe i'll start something that'll be my that'll be my retirement plan i'm gonna i'll buy some land out somewhere and we'll just have a nice little nice little community sprung up somewhere why do i find the father so inspiring is it just me from jericho yeah i found it i found him inspiring too like the writer like i get it it's uh there's something i think there's something we've lost we've gained a lot in the modern world but i think there's something we've lost too or are losing and i think it's sacred and we gotta fight to keep that that core uh humanity that that sense of family that sense of togetherness and community uh that's important and it's wonderful again like you can have both like it's amazing you and i are tall you're in australia we're talking over this like this is amazing right like this couldn't happen that's part of it but it can't be at the expense of like you know who's your neighbor across the street and that's you know is a little does she need her snow shoveled or the people that work at your local stores and saying hello and connecting to your community like we live in the world but we also live in in a family in a community and it's really important to nurture those relationships as well and make an effort to do that to be a person of your you know to be a responsible member of your family a responsible member of your community in your city and let those circles move outward um because we we we need that we we there's comfort in the crowd the tribe the group the family have you ever been to australia by the way i've been no i haven't and i'd like to got a lot of deadly creatures i was in new zealand uh a year and a half ago shooting uh i i went and did a little bit on a show that they're shooting they're called the wilds uh which is on amazon it's about the girls they they the young women they crash on an island and it's sort of like lord of the flies but that's right but yeah so that was so i got to spend a month uh five weeks in um in new zealand which was amazing very close uh to australia close but it's but less deadly things there which is not as many snakes and spiders they yeah what's with that like i'm very curious as to how how did that happen i don't know but one one time there was literally a snake outside my door and i live in a suburban area um yeah it just happens around here i don't know we've just got [ __ ] everywhere but i mean it's not as bad as people think you know what i mean so no no i mean you're there you're you know you haven't been eaten during this this i would love to visit like there's i love i love traveling that's one of the blessings of of the line of work that i chose i get you get to travel and you get to experience places and and really live in places for a while which is is great and you start to recognize that there's um there's something common obviously about all people about human experience but also their people are different wherever you go and that's amazing like i beyond the language or whatever like people are fundamentally shaped by their environment by the weather by the you know by the flora and the fauna and the deadly spiders and snakes like it it just makes us who we are and i i i really appreciate that and love to get to go and swim in those waters for a minute hopefully you get a project down here right yeah d on discord well the magic of far cry especially in fact five is the darkness within any person and how real it can feel and it is in big parts to greg and everyone doing such a great job in it very kind uh very kind that was that was the one i think that each of the characters was was tragically flawed like broken broken characters but um but very human and i think that's relatable i think that that's all that that's what's unso unsettling about a well-written villain or or antagonist is if they're not not some other not some idea you can keep at arm's reach but like you recognize yourself in it and it you catch yourself rooting for them or empathizing with them in a way that makes you sort of question things about yourself because we all have that look we all we we all have um the better angels and the demons in us and and it really is um it's a garden that we need to tend robin greg do you remember shooting saw five i forgot you were in seoul oh my god malik was wow with miss ben's yeah that was that was exhausting no it was exhausting because yeah so you go through all the the stages and every minute of every day of every shot you're about to die like the clock is one yeah so you're at this like super heightened state and and i think we shot i think i only shot for two weeks on that like all the way like it was all back to back to back and like you go from one room to the next to the next and long days so you were one of the five were you in the yeah and then i was in again and yeah i survived i played malik the trust fund team sorry it's been it's been literally 10 years since i watched it yeah and then it came back for cameo in seven as well oh wow that's in the in the survivors group yeah i mean that was just one scene but uh yeah no that's pretty cool that was that was neat to be a part of that as well and and julie benz's was pretty she's a really interesting lady and a very fine actor as well and and you know we sort of survived to the end and the only part that freaked me out about that was so at the the last scene i feed my hand into the saw and i cut like to to capacity and it just goes yeah yeah it gets cut in half but like on the day so they built this thing and there was three or four slots with saws going but three of the four had saws going and there was one empty one that like one but they weren't blocked off like they were all open and i just remember going like am i putting my hand in the right the right hole so there was like if you see my face that's real terror before every take to make sure that it was like i'm sticking it in the right hole otherwise this is going to be a surely that's a short health and safety hazard yeah it was just because it was reflecting like there was there had been plexiglass in the way but the way they were shooting into it it was reflecting back or yeah i remember a couple of takes there was no it was pick the right hole i recently discovered hudson and rex and i was so surprised when greg was in an episode and was like what yeah that's a there was a that's a fun little show there's a cup the production company that does us uh does that is a company called shaftesbury films and i had done a series called regenesis which was uh all about like um sort of like a cdc swat team like by they they would go and fight pandemics around the world it was a little ahead of its time and this was there this is their new show and they shoot that out in uh st john's newfoundland where i shot um a frontier with jason mamoa the netflix series so they asked mountain and do uh do an episode of that show and it was a lot of fun and nice to see old friends again this is a smaller town so it's like the same crew that's on any show is going to be on that so that was that was fun to go out and do that good people out in singapore you've done a lot of good shows you were also in um handmaid's tale were ya yes yeah wow yeah that was a lot that was that was that was uh amazing because again you i find that i i i find things i love about every show that i'm on and and as an actor like you create a moment with another actor and and and it it's it just it has its own thing but then there's like how it's shot how is editing all those other things like you know when you're on an a-list show like that that's so critically claimed that everybody is at the top of their game like it's just the best of the best of the best and elizabeth moss was is she's pretty good oh my god it's the most oh she's just it's i tell you the weirdest experience like you know if people have um you can read minds right yeah like if i had that skill like i could know what you're thinking yeah it's almost like she has the inverse skill that i could know what she was thinking like as i was she was looking at me like she it's she's so um available or so profound that you almost it's almost like she's talking to the inside of your head it was a i i'm not sure i'm doing it justice to describe but she's she's an incredible actor um no accident that she's as great as she is and everything she does and just everybody on that show the way from top down from wardrobe to you could just tell it's everybody yeah everybody a plus a plus a plus people for sure what season were you in uh season two season two and i did it and they were just saying the first season so i'm yeah i did three or four episodes and they were they were flirting with the idea of maybe having me stay on as like the bad guy through the whole season um but it just uh then they they they decided story wise that they wanted to have me out at that point um and then i ended up going back and shooting uh frontier the third season of frontier so it all sort of worked out in the end because i wouldn't have been available for that so um it was good wow greg i loved you and at astra were you even at astra yes yes yeah just a tiny bit this that's another i'm sorry it's like oh i had been you're in everything you said troy this this year was my 100th credit uh yeah 100th film movie and tv yeah including games 100th project was right before christmas yeah at astra was a bit funny um they i had uh i read for a part this the original script the script that i had read for was different quite different there was um so the the crew that goes out with brad pitt in space to find his dad i had read for the commander of that operation so i did a little zoom call james gray had seen history of violence and it liked me from back then the director of this movie and so i read for this part and he was interested and they um they they uh i was in the dominican republic shooting another series and i found out i got cast and it was like it was a big part it was like the fourth lead of the movie after and like space stuff and this character there was i'm not gonna give names but there in the original script his sister's part was a much bigger part and there was a very big movie star attached to it and my character goes goes through and is the commander and is helping brad pitt and then it turns out that i'm like a dark agent and i interrogate wow there's a great interrogation scene with his sister and i kill the sister and then brad pitt and i fight in space and he kills me that's a different movie yeah so i'm i'm in the dominican shooting this crazy series with some canadian friends of mine um alan hawko and um paul gross and and series called caught and i played this like totally sketched out like drug-addled middle-aged guy having midlife crisis in love with this like 20 something year old in a thing and doing cocaine and it's crazy like this crazy fun and then i go jealous mad and end up getting killed it was fun but i'm going to go right after that i'm going to shoot at astra and they're negotiating the deal they're negotiating the deal and negotiating the deal and you know little things like housing and then the space and all that stuff and my kids were my my two kids my my youngest then my middle one had come out and they were doing some surfing and spending some time with me in the dominican and we were getting ready to fly home and we're getting ready to get in a car to go to the airport and my phone rings and it's like both my managers in la and toronto and they're like is this a good time i'm like oh no like that they're like the the script has been drastically altered like wow that that whole storyline has been cut out and your part as the commander doesn't really exist anymore and the other people that they had already like the other so i could have been like on the spaceship they'd already s signed their deals and mine wasn't closed the time so they said james wants the director wants to talk to you so he calls and he's like apologizing [Music] and i really want you to be in the movie there's this little part all the scenes are with it's like two or three scenes with brad pitt i just i'd love for you to be a part of this movie and my first instinct was my ego was like no way [ __ ] this you know because it was this great part like a big lead and it was you know that's still a big deal and like yeah it's a big hollywood film with a mate with brad pitt and like i mean james gray this is this is it like this is the big leagues and then i thought why am i being such an ass like go and have the experience and so i went out and spent three weeks in los angeles and it was like shooting like one day a week and having time out there and and getting to watch grad work was amazing was it um was it a lot of green screen or what was the set like show so my stuff happens on like the space station so they had built like i'm on i meet him in a hallway we're walking walking through a room and then he's talking sending a message to his father and i'm on the other side of the glass and you know it's this this sort of i'm like this morally ambiguous ambiguous character but getting to go and play with them and hoichivan so he's shooting right so it's the same thing like it was a great experience even though sometimes your ego gets in the way and i'm like oh but it's such a small part and like you didn't know you know what i mean like people don't so part of you part of me feels and i think this is something we all have to learn to get past is like get get out of the way of feeling insecure about who you are and what you've done it was still an amazing experience the original plan didn't work out no one got hurt you know i i got to work with brad pitt for a few days and be part of this really ambitious and beautiful film and just it's okay it's you don't always have to be the lead you don't always have to be this big part you don't always have to sometimes it's okay to just enjoy the moment i think the older i get you just learn to enjoy the experience for what it is and try to get out of your own way and just be sometimes it's going to be big sometimes it's going to be not so much and that's that's life and other than for a very very few people in any profession you are always striving and always you want more but be grateful for the moments that happen because otherwise you're just miserable if you're always thinking about what what's not or what isn't then you're you think you can you can never be happy that and you can never be present in the moment either so what was that how often do you get to have how often you get to have the guy that looks exactly like brad pitt movie star movie stars walk down a hall towards you and you're sitting there going like oh my god he's on the new york times magazine on my coffee table just focus greg focus because you got to be professional that's crazy right well i'm a fan too like i mean i grew up in winnipeg manitoba watching movies and so i i see people and i'm like i can't believe that so and so or whatever it's wild so did you get star struck with him yeah oh god yeah the first time i saw like yeah the first time and the camera was on him thankfully but it was like this is and i've worked with i've worked with some big names yeah sure diego mortensen and ed harris and william heard and like you know heavy hitters lots and lots and clive on and apology might like big but there's there's like there's that which is like stars and everyone knows yeah and then there's this person who's not even on some level he's been so consumed by the tabloids and everything that he it like there's an exit there's like a brad pitt existence that's separate from the guy who's trying to figure out his life and is really talented and really charming and charismatic and all those qualities but it's also just like a person and it turns out a really charming midwestern gentleman like he's a great guy super nice guy um so it just goes to show you that you always i think that we imagine that people's lives are somehow vastly different than our own but when the lights go out at the end of the day we're all sort of facing the same uncertain future wow that's amazing i'm getting a lot of people here saying um it might be because of the hat you've got on but everyone's saying you should be in red dead three red devils which you talked about earlier they want you to read their reaction i don't know how if they watch but i think that that's like that that is i've i love cowboys i love western and i think those games are incredible they're so beautiful and the characters are so interesting if they need an outlaw or a less than outlaw outlaw i would always uh if it's a good character i'll play i'd love to come play a hundred percent um how much longer we got you man i don't want to um i got to be honest i've got i've got whenever you want to go you're right i'm okay beautiful um the soundtrack of far cry 5 has to be one of the most beautiful i've ever listened to the whole soundtrack downloaded on my phone so calming and mesmerizing do you think of the soundtrack greg have you had a chance to yeah no they that with the um the father edition that they sent me a few of it comes with like the the the the cd yeah i mean it's it's got again every detail they paid attention to like they really crafted this game lovingly um and and that's a top down thing they dan wanted to make something very special so every detail and and um every department really brought something to it and you get a real sense of that world i think the music always you know i think of like the coen brothers movies or something like oh brother where are those you know like music brings you to a world because it's such a part of our lives you know you've got those favorite songs that will take you back to a place or a time or or just change your state so uh yeah i agree i think the music's pretty incredible peace was never an option says was it weird not having someone who you could bounce off during the making of far cry 5 as they had a silent player character i think you touched on that earlier there was someone there on the other side a lot of times wasn't there yeah yeah the player like the player who you see because it's all pov you're looking at the players always looking at me yeah so that player there was a guy his name's randy actually and uh so that that was super super helpful because i i like to talk to someone like someone real like i like to have it i i like a prop in my hand if i have to have it i want to talk to someone i want to have this connection um as an actor and as a person so i think that there's and there's some some games that that's just not afforded you're you're interacting with stuff that doesn't exist and and um which is a real uh skill and i was i felt fortunate that i did not have to um develop that skill and i actually got to speak to someone the whole time it's a little different a lot of people hear saying um that you look like matthew mcconaughey it might be the hat again as well do you get that i get that yeah i do get that sometimes yeah um it's funny i've i i think that he i could there's been a few times where i could get him into trouble because people are real convinced that that it that or depends on sometimes jason clark like i get one of the two jason clark is he is new zealand australian am i thinking of the right guy yeah probably planet of the age of the apes yeah i'm pretty sure he's helped somebody yeah yeah so sometimes i get uh i do i do get that comparison and i'm very flattered by that uh i i'm a huge matthew mcconaughey fan as uh as an actor and as a person i like the way he carries his uh does his business jason clark is australian but i think you've got him in the looks department well that's very tiny um greg what do you think of a tv show would you replies praise the role as the father in a far cry tv show in a heartbeat yeah in a heartbeat and i know that there was there was some discussion about that at um really yeah at one point because it's you know it's a the canon like each of the i think there were some ideas kicked around for for doing like almost like a far cry anthology series would love season would be a different you know um so yes i would i i just it's a great character so it would be of course i would love to reprise it and explore it in a different medium um i mean i i got a little taste of that when we did that inside eden's gate but to um for amazon but to to really have another another dance with the father would be uh would be exciting is it something you could just switch on the father or do you have to prepare to get into him well they're all just kind of shades of me in some way so i hear that a lot from actors yeah like it really is bringing yourself for our i find bring myself to the circumstances as truthfully as i can and that makes you different because like if i put you if you were at a you know i made you king of australia tomorrow you'd be you'd be different because people react to you differently but yeah you still have the same impulses uh so no i i could i could um i i need i'd like to listen to it a little bit because you not so much that it's the character but like i was in a different place when i was doing it so i would just like to sort of touch touch into that version of me yeah but i i could do it it it the drop but give me 15 minutes and you the father would be uh i would be happy to take him again yeah which of the three endings do you think is canon greek um is it the what is it the walk away the nuke i think it's the nuke yeah yeah when you wind up in the uh bunker in the bunker yeah yeah with uh me and the deputy that's so it's so weird it's such a it's so like the ending again i applaud them it's a cool ending cool ending oh it's crazy like he was right like it was like it was right it's crazy what they did um and and as they were doing it i know they um i mean i don't it's not pronounced secret they were they were they were art they were fighting with the idea of like having a like a in the book you know kill the father ending and then you you know you can close the game that way and they really fought against it like he dan just did not want any moral certainty he wanted to bring you into a very complicated and unsettling and unsettled world and then just leave you there like literally leave you in the dark there with this oh mad man who was right it's really it's crazy oh man that's awesome um eden skate was amazing have watched it multiple times getting a lot of that here as well kyle uh galner who's who's in that who plays the um videographer uh isa you know i've followed his career a little bit since then is such an amazing actor and a really really cool guy yeah he just has this not just something like uh so that was and barry battles the director who i've again become friends with and i spent some time in los angeles i've gone was amazing too like this this is the the the kind of the sad thing and good thing about this business is i get to meet the most interesting cool people and you meet in sort of the most intense way possible like summer camp or whatever but then it's always goodbyes like they're never part of your life moving forward so you have these really intense incredible moments where you share them again and you never see them again you know you keep you shoot an email every once in a while and maybe if you're in town together you get together for bitee but it's it kind of is sad weird one it is a weird one yeah it is weird like i'm grateful i'm very grateful i'm very grateful that i've had that i have a family that i always come home to that uh like a life that i come home dude that's red that's built around me like this beyond the house like it's an actual life and my role is clearly defined in it so that i i'm not in that lost space for too long it's like oh here i am again put on this pair of pants and now i'm dad and husband again because i know that some people they struggle with that loss because you're you're someone else in another place in another headspace for a long time and then you come back and if there's nothing to anchor you to the here and the now you can you can drift in the fog for a bit i i know that for a fact it doesn't surprise i mean it's actors are notorious for like substance abuse problems and just kind of self-destructive behavior but i think it's because you you you lose you for a while and you just it's a scary place to be it's like you're having this you know people have like a midlife christ or an existential crisis once in their life like you have it you know depends on how many different projects you're working on you're doing going through that for four or five times a year uh um was that a controversial ending a few people are saying that i i don't remember it being that controversial it was because they didn't they didn't uh they didn't judge like i think people were not happy that it wasn't like oh he's bad and people also like they got politicized a little bit um you know which side of the the rubric you are you know left right republican democrat whatever and the fact that they that they didn't the game didn't judge the characters in a in a in an absolute way and kind of kept it light left it open like they're people yeah so that was it was it was a bit controversial but i think good art should be a bit controversial it shouldn't be boxed into anything too neat yeah uh how did the writers explain the theme of far cry 5 to greg um well they it was cool because they so they brought me out to montreal and they had this world like this massive map set up in a room with all the artwork and the influence stuff so it was pretty and they and and dan spent the better part of the day just talking me through the family and through the father and the back story and what they wanted in the regions and the relationships and it was just it was amazing like he's like hey he's a great storyteller playing super captivating guys so it was they uh so that's what it happened and and it and then they started to write specifically for me like drew they had an outline of the character and then they started to they would allow me to improvise and personalize some of the writing and then drew got really like um who was the head writer we got kind of very good good headspace wavelength that he was writing very specifically for things that he knew would like pop in me so he was kind of like it's like you have a thing where you know certain things are gonna get a reaction or or are going to connect and resonate and he he wrote to that pretty specific this is pretty cool to have stuff yeah it was specifically written and the fact that you got called in for this job that doesn't happen much in video games yeah yeah yeah like once we started because it's a long process right so and they're writing it as they go along like it's not like a movie when you show up with a script so so as the latest stuff would go on yeah it was pretty cool that how how tailored it became uh greg what do you have any future projects that you can talk about are you going to be in far cry 6. i'd i'd love you to be a far cry 6 i don't think those worlds meet up but you never know yeah i don't i don't i mean the beach looks super nice and i'm a huge cuba fan but uh yeah i've got a couple of uh i've got a couple of movies that i shop for christmas that are doing the festival circuit and we'll get released one is this um a werewolf thriller called bloodthirsty uh which was really fun it's kind of like a feminist take on a werewolf um the theme and it's super interesting it's a female werewolf is it so yeah so i play a werewolf as well and i play this music producer who's like this you know recluse maybe murdered his wife maybe not whatever and then this young singer who's i'm this girl lauren gray is a like she's she's amazing and is a young like an emerging singer and and she's struggling with the fact that she's also a werewolf and she comes out to work with this producer and it's you know it's like the father-daughter dynamic dance like mentor protege and so it's and it was directed by a woman named a girl named amelia moses young young female director from montreal she was great um so that was cool and then i did this movie which is not out yet uh but will be coming out called the fight machine which was super thrilling because my son plays my son in it and uh the oldest boy uh dempsey so we got to have this amazing it's about it's about two boxers one from a poor area one from a kid that's wealthy but self-destructive that falls into it and so my son who boxed i boxed for real and my son was a the uh bronze gloves champion in ontario like he we grew up oh you're actually books yeah yeah and so then we so i play his trainer and his father and we have a very dysfunctional relationship and an intense relationship and that was a thrill to shoot with him um and and then another movie that's another one that's coming out is um a movie called marlene they're in canada there's a very famous uh story a 14 year old boy named steven truscott was convicted of raping and murdering murdering his classmate a 12 year old classmate and put on death row at 14. wow and he spent a decade on death row and then was released like it wasn't him so i played him from 40 and then and then late in life they he and his wife marlene fight to part of him being released was they didn't acknowledge that he was innocent and he i didn't live under my i had to live under an assumed name and i raised the family like i you know i had this whole i have this whole world where i've raised three kids and have a marriage and and no one knows who i really am and then we fight to to clear my name once and for all and and that was that sounds amazing that it was amazing uh yeah as a another acting challenge and the cool thing about that is my oldest son played me at 20. oh my god you're really getting your sunset yeah so we we both yeah that's awesome so yeah so i got to got to have that that experience with him as well but that character was just um when's that coming out that sounds amazing it's a great it's a great story and it's a great it was a great character and a great challenge so so those are the three things that are oh and i also have a movie this crazy movie coming called super dicks where i only did uh i play like an alex jones type talk show host like conspiratorial um in my basement doing like shh broadcasting onto the world so that was fun because it was just like this manic energy crazy character so were these all shot before cover during after so the two the the marlene and i shot marlene and then went right into the fight machine and that we wrapped on monday my son flew back to los angeles on tuesday by thursday the world was going crazy and we flew him back and that's when the whole moved into the living thing happened so he like literally just we had just wrapped and then these other movies i shot the film industry is open in toronto and has been for the for a year very different um [Music] very different uh protocols very like very rigorous testing and stuff and i also have a series coming out soon that i shot with the late christopher plummer and archie pandera called the departure yeah so that's uh that's also coming out do you know what um what streaming service that was that was on the season one was on bbc and i want to say whatever the canadian network was so i think bbc is like the international distribution and season one aired already and i'm in season two oh okay so that'll be coming out you know sometime soon so what do you what do you prefer out of the tv movie uh they both have they both have you know uh strength somewhere advantages and if tvs you tend to shoot a little bit quicker faster yeah more pages but there's something special about um you know you create like a family i did this werewolf show called bitten years a few years ago for um the sci-fi channel now so netflix and stuff that was pretty amazing because there's a great group of young actors that sort of i played like the pack alpha and uh but it was it was really a kind of like a crime family drama but being with each other for four years was great so i like that aspect of that you build relationships over time and you can really explore a character and develop a character like frontier same thing they when they i knew the producers but they had written nothing for they were interested in me for uh a different part i was under option for another show so they that that went away and then my show got cancelled so i was free and they said well we've we have this character we haven't written a single line for him yet his name's cobb's pond and he's going to be based on this real live uh assassin gunfighter from boston and oscar wilde and i'm like i'm in like just call my agent i'm in like whatever you have whatever and then we created this character like then i showed up on the first day the first episode there was nothing written for me and we just created this little bit of business and then eventually this character became this very sexually fluid morally ambiguous sociopath dandy [ __ ] amazing amazing with furs is that one of your favorites yeah yeah it was amazing it's so much fun like i like again i i really love what i do i feel i feel very lucky i know that you know i put my my family through some hard times financially particularly at first and and i can definitely be a um i'm a volatile personality and i'm you know i'm i blow hot and cold but um yeah yeah all in all it's been a wonderful life like it really has been a it's been a i i feel such a privilege to to be part of this band of outlaws that we call actors i really do what about jason momoa is he what's he like aquaman himself awesome yeah he's fun you know paul bunyan you know like the american folk hero paul bunyan that's got like the ox blue like that's him in real life he's huge and he's big energy and i mean he he likes 12 guinness pints of guinness at dinner and it's like nothing he is a human being and he is he's really conscientious about like he's really involved in the making of a show he is you know he directed some a frontier did he um in the other season in season three and um my only beef with jason momoa is he got so busy with aquaman and then c for apple that he just wasn't available to do season four of frontier which was yeah i mean i knew the arc for the character like my my character and and samuel um uh samuel grant's arc this sort of this love dance and crazy i had an amazing resolution so i would have loved to shoot season four but you cannot but it's gonna do you think it's there's a chance no no no i no it's uh i think that that um that ship sale but mamoa is uh is an impressive human being and he's just full of energy and and he's a real uh he has his he has this band of merry men like his close group of friends that he's with and they just they just he's just has fun like he lives lives out loud that one yeah and a fine actor too he's a very good actor like in a smart guy like he's very physically like he's jason mamoa but he's also like he's smart and he's you know he's he's an artist is he a bit of a gentle giant yeah i mean i i never saw that i'm sure that he's a not so gentle giant at times too like that's definitely a capability like he's pretty good with an axe but yeah he's just he's playful like he's enjoying his life and he it didn't come easy he he also was a you know a working not so working actor for a long time and you know and then game of thrones you know he had that and and it was a funny because you talked to him and i think this is pretty common knowledge but he knew that he was aquaman for years before they shot it but he couldn't tell anyone and he couldn't get a job he couldn't get arrested in hollywood and he was like broke and then all of a sudden he became this huge you know just like one gig doesn't it yeah yeah and you got to be great in it it's got to be the right part and you got to be great in it and then you know an audience responds to it and there you go but you know he's he's he's a really good guy too you like to see that you like to see good people do well oh yeah a couple more questions for you greg i really appreciate your time mate i'm enjoying this thank you um you should be in better call seoul with michael mando fuss and the father together yeah that's look that's a great that's a great show and uh and he's michael mando's dynamite in it and uh yeah that's that's just so good like that breaking bad is probably my favorite show of all time and you know it's the same team same team so yeah that i would i would love to be on uh i would love to be on a show like that's something i want to ask you favorite movies give me some um uh the royal tannenbaums oh yeah it's my favorite movie uh the graduate i love oh yeah uh those would be and pretty woman oh wow that's pretty diverse weird right it's it's a weird it's uh like i i was like uh you know when i was a teenager i wasn't uh like i was pretty i was pretty like pretty chubby teen pretty shy pretty not good with girls at all and i remember falling in love with julia robertson pretty woman like that snap the thing and i think i saw the movie like 10 times in the theater because there was no you know vhs at the time so that and the graduate i remember seeing and royal tanner mom's royal is my favorite movie character if you have a dream world you could play would be royal like royal cannonball the gene hackman part i think is just unbelievable it's so great and he's so great in it and wes anderson is just he's so stylized and he's so oh isn't he good but yeah but yeah but just lets characters have moments without being indulgent with them and it's just really he's that's great so that'd be mine what about yourself what's your favorite movie i'm a i'm a nolan fan to be honest oh yeah yeah so i like i would i would probably say interstellar's up there if you've ever seen that yeah yeah yeah yeah i've never seen it i i'm sorry i've never seen that movie yet yeah it's crazy because it's been for and i've always meant to see it um and my kids say like how have you not seen it but i haven't seen it yet yeah but that's miss mcconaughey right that is mr mcconaughey funnily enough yeah um yeah that one springs to mind for me but there's so many isn't there um yeah uh uh who else we got here any advice greg for upcoming actors it's a tough business but any any advice if you're really passionate about about and you can't do anything else what would you say i would say um you know this is what i said to my my kids growing up like even if it's a one in a million business someone has to be that one so why not you yeah i i think that you have to be resilient we like really be resilient you can people you can get a break right away and whatever you know and be launched off into la la land or whatever but it's for the most part it's it's hard work and be generous with yourself um all you have is yourself as an actor and that's all you need like you can never be anyone else if you pretend to be someone else that person exists out there and they're gonna get the parks that's them so you you really have to be honest with yourself and share the best of yourself and the worst of yourself and don't judge yourself and just be willing to let it all hang out there's a great quote that and i i can't ascribe to anyone but acting is turning around naked in front of an audience twice you have to reveal yourself and you have to have both an open heart and a strong heart because you're going to get you're going to get your heart broken in this business there's going to be parts you wanted so badly and you need it so much that just aren't going to go your way and there's going to be times when you feel unseen and without value but you have to believe in yourself and train and learn and care about it don't be don't don't think that fame is the if you want to be famous be give value to the industry be great like work on your talent work on work on yourself as an actor first second third and fourth let everything else take care of itself but if you have to do it and you want to do it be a generous storyteller like share yourself with people all of you all of whatever you are not just like what you think is nice or i always say like i try to as a motto as an actor is beauty not pretty you know because beauty is yeah and i never want to play a pretty character i don't want to protect myself i don't want to worry about some image or anything just let it all be you be human well i don't think we can end on a better note than that greg um it's been
