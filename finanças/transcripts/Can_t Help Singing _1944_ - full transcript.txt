There they come! Mr. President, I have the honor to deliver to you the first shipment of gold from California. Thank you, Captain. On this auspicious occasion, I feel compelled to say a few words. From the soil of this great continent has come a precious metal... Gold. The majestic earth of this noble, fertile land, which has given us fuel for our homes in the form of coal from the great mines of Pennsylvania, food in the form of wheat, and corn, and barley. From the plains of our western frontier... I'm beginning to see now why you insisted Caroline spend the weekend in the country. I'm certain it's for her own good. I'm certain you're certain, Martin, just as I'm certain you've overlooked the fact she'll be back in town tomorrow night for the White House reception. What then? Anything might happen. It's possible the 4th Cavalry will receive its marching orders before tomorrow night. Things happen quickly in the War Department these days. You haven't overlooked a thing, have you? Not a thing.

Oh, welcome home, Lieutenant Latham. Hello, Alfred. Things were kind of quiet while you were away. Well, now that we're back, we'll see if we can't take care of it. Any changes in the political picture? We never heard how the elections came out. Well, Senator McLean was defeated. We'll be losing him next month. That's a shame. Lovely girl, the Senator's daughter. Talented too. What about Senator Frost? - He was returned by a big plurality. - Is that so? Yes. Looks like we're gonna have him around for quite a spell. That's fine. You know, I remember when Senator Frost first come to Washington, I said to Martha-- That's my wife. I said, "He'll be the biggest man in the country," I said. - Miss McLean. - Robert. - Caroline. - Robert. Please, Robert. No, not here. You mustn't. I imagine you'll find Washington rather dull after the west. They tell me it's very beautiful. It is beautiful. Everywhere I looked you were there. Oh, Robert... I mean... I mean, Lieutenant. I want to hear all about your trip. It must be very exciting to meet a man like Jake Carstair. I've always been interested in the west. It's so wild and dangerous they say. Not half as dangerous as you in the moonlight. The officers and their ladies are having a little celebration tomorrow night at the barracks. I trust I may have the honor? Oh, I'd love to, but... But there's a reception at the White House. Remember the balcony at the barracks the night I went away? The President has asked me to sing. There was no one else in the world that night, just you and I. My father made me promise I'd attend. That same moon will be there, waiting, and I'll be waiting too. Hello, Father. I as under the impression you were in the country. I was. I went for a drive in the carriage, and suddenly I realized I was such a short distance from Washington, I just drove in. You remember Lieutenant Latham, of course? Of course, very well. How do you do, Lieutenant? How do you do, Senator? - And my Aunt Cissy? - It's a pleasure to see you again, ma'am. Congratulations, sir. I was very happy to hear of your re-election. I'm sure you were. Come, Caroline. Well, Lieutenant Latham's just been telling me all about the west. It sounds terribly exciting. With all the gold in California, I'm surprised to see you back here. All the gold is not in California, sir. Then you plan on being stationed in Washington permanently, Lieutenant? The plans of a soldier are quite as uncertain as those of a politician, sir. One never knows. I hope I shall see you again soon. Coming, Cecelia? Yes, Martin. Good day, Lieutenant. Tomorrow night. Will you keep my place in your heart open, Robert? The political experts say my father will be returned to office next election. Sarcasm isn't very becoming to you, Jeannie. You know, the first time I saw you, you were riding in the park, a beautiful white steed. It was love at first sight. I'm convinced now it was the horse. For a diplomat, Martin, you certainly displayed very little tact with Lieutenant Latham. Stop calling your father Martin. It's disrespectful. He loves it. I don't believe in pretense. I dislike Lieutenant Latham intensely. Ha! It's obvious. He's an opportunist. He's interested in you solely because I'm in a position to help him further his career. I think he's charming. He has... He has character. Yes, and it's all bad. How do you do? I'm convinced the only reason you like him is because I don't. How do you do? You're the most obstinate daughter a man ever had. She comes from a long line of obstinate people. - Senator Frost. - Abe. I want you to promise me you won't see him again. I'll promise no such thing. Now see here, Caroline-- If you ask me, you're only rubbing her the wrong way. The sooner you forget Lieutenant Latham, the sooner Caroline will. You're both wrong. Well, anyway, with all his conniving, he hasn't been able to quite make himself welcome at the White House. You shan't see him tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? - The White House reception. You haven't forgotten you're to sing for the president, have you? Oh, no, no, I hadn't forgotten. The President of the United States is expecting you to sing tonight and you're going to sing. All right, Martin. I'll go. I'll sing. She's in no condition to sing, it's ridiculous. Ridiculous? It's fantastic. In all the annals of medical history, no one ever heard of a cold developing so quickly. Oh, your hand feels so cool. Why, you are burning up. Temperature. She's on fire! I better send for Dr. Carol. Oh, no. No, I'll be all right. You're ill, Caroline. I just need some sleep. Run along, both of you. Why, I wouldn't think of leaving you in this condition. Cissy, you go on. Make my apologies to the president. Nonsense. You go, I'll stay. No, no, no. Please. I-- I don't want anyone to stay. I-- I'll be much better if I'm just left alone. Good night. Have a good time. Well, good night, dear. I'll be home early. Don't hurry. Wonder how those got there. I wonder. I-- I feel much better. But that's the way with temperatures. They come and go quickly. Yes. They're hot. Yes. Uh... Now will you please hurry and dress? - We can't keep the president waiting. - No, of course not. Oh, why don't you both go ahead and I'll get dressed and take another carriage. Fine. Oh, by the way, don't bother stopping by the officers barracks. Lieutenant Latham is out of town. Oh, but that's impossible. I saw him last ni-- His troop left at dawn. The Secretary of War has sent them to guard the Carstair Mines of Sonora. Well, I-- I think I'll go and fix my hair. How could you do such a thing? Me do such a thing? I'm not the Secretary of War, my dear. But you're his best friend. - Father, I'll never forgive you for this. - You will in time. I'm going to marry Robert and you can't stop me. I don't intend to sit idly by and watch my daughter throw her life away on a good for nothing rascal. You can't just juggle people's lives around like you do in all of your silly old budget figures. I'm old enough to know my own mind. At least I'm old enough to know my own heart. And I love Robert. Oh, now, now. You-- You-- You-- You only think you do. - But I do! - All right! You love him. Have it your own way. Aw, but... You'll get over it. Time heals everything. It can't. It wont. Aw... Now, now, come, come, come. Yes, it will. Now, now... You'll go away somewhere for a rest? No! I was just thinking last week. Why, you can go up to New York and visit your Uncle John. There's a new company singing at the Opera House. You would like that. Oh, come on now. Tell me you would like that. Wouldn't you? Uh-huh. Well, of course you would. Now, here. Let's wipe the tears out of those pretty eyes and you go right down to the depot and buy yourself a ticket. It would cost a great deal of money. Well, we're not going to worry over trivialities, are we? Here, $200 should be enough, don't you think? Oh, it would cost a great deal more than that. I guess it would just be too expensive. Has money ever meant anything where my daughter's happiness was at stake? Of course not. Huh? You're such a sweet, understanding father. You always know what's best for me. You almost always get your own way too, don't you? Well, almost. Now, here. You hurry up and get dressed. Well, uh, maybe you better go ahead. No need of us all being late. Well, uh, all right. - But you hurry, my dear. - Yes, I will. And, thank you, Father. Oh, not at all, not at all. Henrietta! Henrietta! What you up to, Miss Caroline? - I'm gonna be married. - Married? Tonight? If I can catch up with him. Have Joseph get a carriage ready. Where you going, Miss Caroline? I'm gonna pick that one too. Yes, but where you going, Miss Caroline? - To Pittsburgh. - Oh, Pittsburgh! - Maybe Cincinnati. - Oh. - Maybe St. Louis. - St. Louis? - Maybe California. - California! Good heavens! Just can't stand pryin'. When a critter starts asking your name, it's getting too inquisitive. There's a boat! Grab a line! Warren, will you stop twisting your hair? Where's the baby's milk? Uncle Harry's bringing it. Careful now. Look out for that cow. Would you help me carry my-- Sorry, lady, got a load. Would you help me carry my trunk? I'm loaded down too, ma'am. I wonder if you'd carry my trunk. No chance, lady. Keep your eyes peeled for a couple of stowaways. I'll watch the other gangplank. I certainly will. Would you mind helping me with my trunk? Would you-- Oh, never mind. Madame. Perhaps I can be of assistance, madame. Allow me to present myself. My name is Prince Gregorio Alexandrovich Strogonoski. Uh... Oh, yes, his name is Koppa. My full name is Kapi-- Uh, may I? Well, it would be a great favor. I must get ashore immediately. Immediately, madame. Uh, Koppa. Carry the lady's trunk ashore, please. Oh, surely, surely. It's very nice of you to be so kind to me, Your Highness. Madame, no trouble at all. Uh, ready, madame? Uh, Koppa, all right. Madame. Careful, though. Ooh, thank you. - Lovely trip. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. I'm certainly grateful to you, gentlemen for helping me with my trunk. It was a pleasure. Your Highness! Your Highness! Would you mind carrying my trunk just a little further? I'm terribly sorry-- Oh, but I have to get up there. Please. It's so valuable to me. Why, it's worth its weight in gold. Oh, with pleasure, madame. - Delighted. - Thank you. - I beg your pardon. - Mmm-hmm. I'm looking for a Lieutenant-- I'm a lieutenant. No, I'm looking for Lieutenant Latham. He's with the 4th Cavalry. Oh, they left last night for Fort Bridger. Oh, but they told me in St. Louis I'd catch up with him here. They're going to guard the Carstair holdings in California. Yes, I know. How can I get to Fort Bridger? I'd be happy to escort you there, madam. Oh, you would? Of course, I'll have to get a three weeks furlough. Oh, where can I get a stagecoach? There isn't any. Why don't you stay right here? There's a wagon train leaving in the morning. You might be able to arrange a ride with someone. Be kind of rough. Oh, I don't care if I can just get there. - Where are the wagons? - Down at the end of the street. - Thank you. - No, thank you. Oh, thank you very much. I think I can find them myself. Coming, Your Highness? Uh, yes, madame. Surely, madame. Koppa. Now, my dear friend, Koppa.

Maybe I could arrange to take you along with us. Just a minute, Lemuel. If you was planning on giving this young woman a seat in this wagon, you should've thought of it 13 years ago and saved room. My profit on the venture was $100,000. Since then, I've simply been living on the interest of the money. Hold the light, please. Mmm-hmm. Excuse me. Thank you, my good man. Interested in buying a wagon, lady? Why, yes, I am. It seems to be the only way I'll ever get to Fort Bridger. - Are you the owner? - Yessum. And I don't mind saying you're lucky to find a first class outfit like this, ma'am. Finest wagon this side of Pittsburgh. Those horses look a little thin. Well, to an experienced eye, ma'am, they might appear to be a little bit on the over-trained side, but you mustn't be deceived by appearances, ma'am. There's blue blood in them steeds. You see, they've been bred for ruggedness. Take my word for it, ma'am, horses is just like women. When it comes to work, it's the little, thin ones that cover the most ground. Begging your pardon, ma'am, but there ain't nothing wrong with them that a little hay won't fix. Well, all right. How much is it? Well, I'd be satisfied with $400, and $200 for the supplies, as flour, bacon, and beans, she's all ready to go. I'll give you $500. Well, you drive a hard bargain, ma'am, but throw in the pouch and it's a deal. 20, 40, 60... I'm going to open it. - 480, 500. - That's just right. I'll... I'll be back later with a bill of sale. Thank you very much. Oh, Your Highness, would you put the trunk in the wagon for me, please? Oh, wait a minute! Koppa. Do you know where I can get a room for the night with a bath? Well, you won't find a room, ma'am, but there's a public bath house over on Main Street. - Thank you. - Don't mention it, ma'am. And I wanna thank both of you too.

Well, you certainly can't figure men out, can you? No. Isn't it marvelous? I got sick and tired of it. Well, I don't blame you. He tried to deny it, but I said, "If you're not drunk, "let's see you get up off of that ground." Warren, will you stop twisting that hair? Stop it. Interested in buying a wagon, lady? Why, I just bought one. This one. You must be mistaken, ma'am. This is my wagon. - Oh, no, it isn't. - Oh, yes, it is. I got my papers right here. But the man sold it to me not more than an hour ago. I'm afraid you've been hoodwinked, ma'am. I paid $500 for it. That's more than I expect to get for it myself. Oh, how could anyone do such a thing? I was planning to leave with the wagon train in the morning. Oh, what am I gonna do? You might drop over to the marshal's ma'am. - Maybe he could help you. - Thank you. May I leave my luggage here? - Yeah, sure. - With my trunk? Trunk? - Howdy, Marshal. - Howdy, Jack. What you got? Plenty, including a warrant for some senator's daughter who's run away from home. Well, what do you know? Now, the Senator's headed this way by a boat. He ought to get in some time tomorrow. I understand there's a $5,000 reward offer. See, I wouldn't mind bumping into her myself. Got any idea what she looks like? Sure, I got a full description of her right here in this bag. $5,000. Why don't you let me take you out of here? It's much too good for you. Four Queens. Very pretty. - Four Aces. - Nothing. - I'm cashin' in. - I'm leavin'. Hey, these are too small for me. Keep 'em. Thanks. Whoo! - Well, I owe you $250. - That's right. How about cuttin' the cards just once? Double or nothing. That sounds like a good idea. After you, sir. King. Well, what do you know? An Ace. That'll be $500. You mark a deck pretty fast for a young fellow. Just a little bit faster than you do. That's dollar sign, five-oh-oh. Well, here's your $500. Thank you very much. My 500. You shouldn't go around grabbing other people's money. It isn't ladylike. It's my money. He swindled me out of it. Me? Swindled you? You sold me a wagon you didn't even own. Do you realize that statement is libelous? You know it's the truth. If you people will excuse me, I-- You're not leaving here with my $500. Why, it's practically the last cent I had to my name. And I need it. I have to get to Fort Bridger. - I'm le-- - That's very interesting, - but if you don't mind, I'd like to-- - Now wait a minute. I bought a wagon and paid for it and now I haven't got a wagon and something's gotta be done about it. Please, lady, you don't have to shout. Let's sit down and talk this thing over. Well, we're not gonna get anywhere unless we have confidence in each other. Then you let go of the money. That would be overconfidence. Well, I'll let go if you will. That's fair enough. Just a minute, folks. There's something I wanna say to you. The last time the marshal come down here to make some arrests, the mirrors on the back bar got all busted up during the scuffle. Now them there mirrors cost a heap of money, and they have to be hauled out here all the way from Chicago. And that's why I'm warning you. The marshal's on his way down here now. He's got a whole hat full of warrants. Five or six horse thieves, been ridin' kinda high. Some girl who ran away from her pappy. $5,000 reward for her return. Then there's some other warrants for some card sharks. It's been gettin' outta hand. Too much double dealin'. Then there's a few other warrants for various and sundry reasons, such as... murder, homicide, little bit of larceny... Petty and grand. Now I don't want nobody to think I'm trying to thwart lawful justice. 'Cause I ain't. All I'm trying to do is save my mirrors. So I'm gonna turn the lights out here in the hall for a few shakes, and them that wants to get can get. Turn 'em out, boys. Oh, no, you don't, young lady. Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am. I-- All right, turn 'em on, boys. Well, the marshal will be down here any time now. What's going on here? Not so fast, young lady. You let me by. I don't wanna tell you how to run your business, lady, but that's my 500. But I have to get to Fort Bridger. You said that. Why'd you run away from your pappy? None of your business. Have it your own way then, so it's none of my business. What's the matter with me? I don't think very fast. Are you going to give me that money? I guess I'm just plain lucky. I think you're just plain rude. Here I've been trying to figure out how to get a stake to get started in California, and it's dumped right in my lap. What are you talking about? What the man at the saloon was talking about, the $5,000 reward. Why-- You're really nice, aren't you? Can you blame me? Somebody's gonna collect the reward. - Why shouldn't it be me? - Because you're a crooked card shark and you can't go near the marshal's office. That's right. That means I'll have to have a confederate and split with her. Do you have any friends here who'd like to get in on a good thing? Who could I get? How would you like to get in on a real good thing? I'm already in on a real good thing. I'll give you $10,000 to get me to Fort Bridger. Let's see the money. I'll give it to you in Fort Bridger. Ah, who's at Fort Bridger? Just some army officers. Army officers don't have $10,000. I know that. Who's the richest man in California? - Richest man in California? - Mmm-hmm. Jake Carstair, I guess. Why? He's the man who's going to give you the $10,000. Is Jake Carstair your father? - Huh-uh. - Well, then-- - Oh, I see. - Well, well. Jake Carstair lives in Sonora. What's he gonna do, meet you at Fort Bridger? Mmm-hmm. You do pretty well, don't you? Where is this wagon you bought and paid for and didn't get and so on and so forth? Oh, I, um... Oh, it's right up there. - Can you cook? - Of course not. - What are you going to do? - No, that's fine. 2,000 miles of travel ahead of us, and I have to hook up with a gal who can't even boil water. Oh, then you will take me to Fort Bridger. There's just one thing. I can tolerate horse stealing, grand larceny, murder, anything but lyin'. If you're not telling me the truth, now's the time to say so. You're standing on my foot. You'll get your money, all right. I give you my word. - Is that the wagon? - Yes. Climb up on the seat. Are we going to leave now? The wagon train will catch up with us in the morning. We stay here tonight, the marshal might run into us. You wouldn't wanna disappoint old Jake Carstair would you? No. No, of course not. Come on then. Would you mind giving me a hand? Not this time. Let's get this straight. You hired me to drive you to Fort Bridger and that doesn't include playing nursemaid to you. Are you always this insulting? On this trip, everything's on a 50-50 basis. That suits me fine. You take of your 50, I'll take care of mine. Very well. Here. Oh! Oh, have they gone? Yes, they've gone. The Indians. I woke up and they're all lookin' at me. Did you have to scare 'em? We might wanna give the country back to them someday. Your highness. What do we do now? - This is a surprise. - Madame. What in the world are you doing here? Err, you see, madam. We ah... By a strange coincidence. Yes, very strange coincidence. We were just passing by your wagon. - Back in Independence. - Yes, Of course, back in Independence. and then we saw your valuable trunk absolutely unprotected, so... So... How do you do? So, we say to ourselves... Ah... we say... - Eh... - We say, Eh... - Madam is careless. - Yes, madam is very careless. - We say. - The town is full of thieves. Ah, the town is full of strange characters. - This trunk is apt to be stolen. - Positively. So, we will guard the trunk for Madam. - No, Gregory sir? - Yes, yes, exactly. So we get into the wagon to guard the trunk and... imagine we... we fall asleep. No. Yes. Yes, but when we wake up... Oh, madam... When we wake up we're surrounded by Indians. Indians! Of course, our first thought was Madam's trunk. Oh, it was a desperate flight... ummm... fight, yes. Desperate, but we saved it. - No? - No. - Yes. - Yes! How can I ever thank you? Why, if anything had ever happened to this trunk... I just don't know what I would have done. So that's the-- Shh... Well, I was careless, but thanks to you gentlemen. Everything's all right. - These are friends of yours? - Yes. And I might add, the only gentlemen I've met so far in this wild west barbarous country Madam. If you... gentlemen would excuse us, we'll be leaving. Ah, with your permission, we shall accompany you to California. Can you cook? Sure, the last place-- Shh, shut up. - Cook? Me? Of course not. Then if you hurry you can get back to Independence before night fall. But you'll have to walk fast. What you mean, Independence? Wait a minute. I'm half owner of that wagon. You speak for your half. My half's full. Hey there! Howdy folks, you plannin' on tavelin' alone, was you? No! Uh, we just got an early start. We were waiting to join your train. Well, guess that's all right. As long as you live up to the rules and regulations. Who's the boss of the wagon? I am! Well, that is... we both are. Married, I take it? No! Positively not! Well, brother and sister? We're no relation. Well, that changes things considerable. See, we don't allow no unattached females in this train. Nobody's got time enough to assume responsibility. - Well, I... - I... I guess we'll have to tell him. On account of her family's objections, the little lady's trying to keep her marriage a secret but... There's really nothing to worry about. She's quite safely married to... Ah, what did you say your name was? Prince Gregory Stroganovsky. You heard it. That's her husband. That... I mean him... Get over there. Everything all right, Mrs. Stroganovsky? How do you do, Mrs. Stroganovsky? How do you do, Mrs. Brown? No, no, my dear friend, Koppa. It isn't clear to me. It isn't. One minute I'm single, the next minute I'm-- It's the custom of the country. One moment you're single, the next you're not. Yes, but nobody can prove I'm married. - But who wants to prove anything? - What do you mean who wants to prove? All I know what I hear people say is... How do you do Mrs. Stroganovsky? I'm Mrs. Brown. I'm glad to meet you, Mrs. Stroganovsky I'm Mrs... No, no all right. No, no wait a minute. Your last name is Mr. Pitrowski, isn't it? Now, now, suppose a woman you've never seen in your life says she's Mrs. Pitrowski? It means that you're married to her eh? - Ah ha. - Then, why... If a woman says she's Mrs. Stroganovsky... then you all say she's Mrs. Stroganovsky... Why can't a woman say she's Mrs. Pitrowski and be Mrs. Pitrowski? Why? Because my real name is O'Shanahan. With a face like that? Stay in close to the wagon! Stay in close to the wagon, folks! Stay close to the wagons, folks. Did it occur to you, Mrs. Stroganovsky? There might be a very good reason why every one else is sticking close to the trail. I don't remember anything in our agreement which permits you to dictate to me where I shall walk. What a shame. It's such a pretty dress too. I left them simmer about an hour. That's much too long for them. Mr. Stroganovsky? Mrs. Stroganovsky, how do you do? Warren, stop twisting your hair. Senator's daughter is single. You sure this girl your taking me to see is marriage? Yep, husband's some kind of count or duke or somethin'. Well, we'll have a look at anyway. - Excuse me! - But, what-- I saw that you hit her! I don't care if she's your wife or not. I'm not gonna stand by and let you strike a poor defenseless woman! What's going on here? - He's beating his wife again. - No! - No use trying to deny it. - Wait a minute he didn't-- Don't stand up for him. How'd you like a little of it yourself? - Who do you think you are? - I'm the marshal. - Let go of me. - He's looking for some senator's daughter. I don't care who he's looking for, I'm gonna tare you up with my bare hands. This is misunderstanding! Please, please! If you all go, everything will be all right. I'm very grateful to you for what you've done for me. Gregory... isn't such a bad husband. He only beats me when he gets mad. When I get mad? Who? The snake. Well, then, Mrs. Stroganovsky, everything will be all right. What did you say her name was? - Strognanovsky. - Princess Stroganovsky. Well, she certainly fits the description they gave me of Senator Frost's daughter Caroline. You sure your name is Stroganovsky? Well, that's my married name. Before I met the prince here. I was just plain Maggie Murphy. Sometimes I wish I was plain Maggie Murphy again. Heaven knows I've tried to be a good wife. But I know there've been times where I've aggravated him. I'm sorry that I made him beat me. Oh, it isn't just for myself. Well, you see. Pretty soon there'll be... You know. You poor child. Oh, I hate to go to pieces like this. I'm not very strong. Guess, you better have a talk with a doctor. Well, I used to dabble medicine when I was a young fellow. May be I could-- Ah, no, thank you, Marshal. We have a doctor here. I'll carry you. - I'm sorry to be such a bother. - No bother at all. Now, I've been right proud with every person in this outfit. - That was a close call, wasn't it? - Yes. - I'm certainly grateful-- - Just protecting my 10000 dollars. Your father certainly doesn't want you to get you to Fort Bridger, does he? Oh, he just doesn't approve of my marriage. He's probably the old fashioned type. Thinks his daughter ought to marry a strapping young fellow and raise a family. Of course you can't have everything can you? What you gonna do in California? Play cards? Probably get married. Oh. What is she like? The girl you're gonna marry? Beautiful. Likes to laugh and have fun. Of course, she has a serious side too. Someone has to have it, you know. It's an anchor. Of course. Kinda thought we might live on a cloud. A cloud? Yeah, those things up there in the sky. I've got a lucky one. I call it cloud number seven. She has a cloud too, nice and fluffy. Hers is cloud number one. Kinda thought we might put 'em together. You know, sorta combine clouds number one and seven. And walk around on cloud 17 for the rest of our lives. Gee. - What's her name? - Who? Girl on the fluffy cloud. I don't know. I haven't met her yet. Oh. Guess maybe it would be all right if you put me down now, huh? Yeah. Guess, may be it'd be all right. Well... Thanks for knocking me down and everything. That's all right. May be you can do the same for me sometime. Bye.

And good riddance to bad rubbish I'd call it. - Come on, I'll help you get your things. - Johnny, don't-- Can't keep a man like Jake Carstairs waiting. Get the trunk and put it in the Brown's wagon.

Strange country, women marry me and leave me for no reason at all. - Gregory let me assure you-- - Hurry up with that trunk! Don't think it hasn't been a pleasant trip, Mrs. Stroganovsky.

I'm going back East. That is if there's anyway I can. In that case, I'll try and get a line on someone returning to Independence. Thank you. Johnny! Johnny! I... I couldn't help it. I thought I could let you go, but... I don't know what this Jake Carstairs means to you-- Oh, Jake Carstairs doesn't mean a thing to me. - You see, Johnny-- - I'm not very bright, am I? Why didn't you straighten me out? Johnny, there's something you ought to know about Jake Carstair I don't wanna know anything about Jake Carstair. Far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist. As far as I'm concerned, he never existed. Let's go back east, Johnny. Uh-uh. We're goin' to California. I spotted a fancy carriage outside. We'll be back to the wagon train in style. Oh, we'll be great in California. You'll have to teach me how to mark the cards and deal from the bottom of the deck and everything. Do you mean that?

That's fine. Coming, Warren? Coming. This way please. Come in. Come in. Coming, Your Highness? Yeah, madame. Koppa, Koppa. I'll get a shave and meet you here in an hour. How many times are you gonna shave? All right, half hour. Who's the man in the fancy coat? Oh, that's Jake Carstair. Carstair? How's your shooting eye today, eh? Umm... Let her go. All right. Hut. How'd you like him to shoot at you? Don't say such a thing. Not even jest, he must be the best shot in the world. Toss up a couple of them, Pedro. Si. That'll be enough for the day, Pedro. All right, boys. Let's all have a drink. Caroline. Caroline? Don't tell me you're ready. There's something we gotta settle right away. I thought we could forget about him I have to get dressed. but I was wrong. All you gotta do is tell him the truth. Carstair's here. Carstair? Where? Over there. We'll tell him how things are. Oh, no. I can't. Well, I mean... Uh... - What's wrong? - Well, it's nothing. - It's just that I-I... - What? You see, I... I don't quite know how to say it. What's the matter with me? I don't think very fast. You just don't want to hurt his feelings, do you? - Oh, no. That isn't it, Johnny. - You go ahead and get dressed. I'll tell him myself. Oh, no. No. I-I-I'll tell him. Umm-umm... You go get changed. - I'll come with you. - No. I'd rather see him alone. Much rather. Which one-- - I mean, where did you say he is? - Over there. Oh, yes. Well, I-I won't be long. So you hurry too. All right. - Good luck. - Yeah. Mr. Carstair. Mr. Carstair? - Mr. Carstair. - Yes. Oh, are you Jake Carstair? That's right. Well, what can I do for you. Well, I haven't got time to explain but you're the man I was supposed to marry. - What? - Please do me a favor. The man I'm going to marry thinks you're in love with me. Oh, I know this doesn't make sense to you but Johnny... He's the man I'm in love with. He's standing right up there watching and... Wait! Oh. Things aren't as they used to be Jake. I've grown up. I've found someone I love. Oh, I-I know it's a shock to you to hear me say that but... Well, there-there isn't anything for me to say but-but I'm sorry. Please act hurt, will you? How could you do such a thing? I can't let you go. - Caroline. - Caroline. I'll never let you go. You're everything I have. - My very life. - Don't over do it. Uh, one thing is not very clear to me. Is she still Mrs. Stroganovsky? Because if she is-- Because if she... Where is this up-starter who's trying to take you away from me? Probably cringing in some dark corner, ashamed to show his face. You're wrong, Mr. Carstair. So this is him, huh? You mean to tell me you'd give up all the things I could give you for-for this? I know you're a big man, Mr. Carstair. You got wealth, and power. If I thought she'd be happy with you, I'd be all for it. But I know she wouldn't be because she isn't in love with you. She's in love with me. She even told me so. Well, I know when I've been licked. I wish you both the best of luck. Thank you. Drinks for the house. Drinks for the lovers. Long may they wave. Mrs. Carstair. Good afternoon, Mrs. Carstair. A toast. A toast to your happiness. And please, always keep a tiny spot in your heart for Jake Carstair who loved you but lost. And here's to Jake Carstair, who loved me and lost but... I'll never forget him. Just a minute. Oh, hello, my dear one. Now who is it that you've loved and lost, Jake? We were toasting this young couple. Answer my question. Who's the young lady? Someone I just met. I mean... I'm Mrs. Carstair. How do you do, Mrs. Carstair? I can explain-- Don't you think you're a bit old to go about loving and losing? Please, Mrs. Carstair, let me explain. I've never seen your husband before in my life. I... Johnny. The thing which is not very clear to me is when, if you... Johnny. Johnny, wait a minute. Please? Johnny. - Johnny, wait. I can explain. - You lied to me. Oh, I just wanted you to take me with you. That's the only reason I made up the story about Carstair. You did? Oh, don't you know there isn't anybody else in the whole wide world but you? Caroline. Darling. It's my fiancée. Will you excuse me a moment, please? You followed me. I knew you would. - Robert. - Let me look at you. - There's something I have to tell you. Johnny... It's still not clear to me whether you... Johnny. Were you... Uh... Please give me a chance to explain. Caroline, what's the meaning of this? This is the man I was coming out here to marry. Well, go ahead and marry him then. - Caroline, I demand an explanation. - Later, Robert. I'm the idiot that toted this bright young lady 3,000 miles so she could marry Jake Carstair. Jake Carstair? Yes. But from what I can see now, you're the one she's going to marry. You must be the one because it certainly isn't going to be me. You better hurry up about it before someone else races up and yells, "Caroline, darling." Caroline, darling. Whoa, whoa. Hold him, hold him. Stop him, stop him. Are you all right? You see what I mean? The line forms to the right, Mister. Are you all right, Dear? Just a minute, Father. Don't think for one moment that I'm running after you because I'm not. Caroline, you'll make me the laughing stock of my whole regiment. She will if you give her time. Who's the old geezer? Jake Carstair's brother? Punch him right in the nose, Robert. Caroline. What's the meaning of this? Just a minute, Father. And one more thing, Mr. Lawlor. Don't think you can apologize and come crawling back-- Caroline, I demand an-- I don't know who you are, young man. But I'm on your side. I resent that, Oh, shut up. Senator. It's obvious there's been some misunderstanding. There's no misunderstanding, Sir. Your daughter's just a liar. Robert, are you gonna stand for that? I most certainly am not. Shut up. It's really not her fault. You see, she comes from a long line of liars. I'm a politician. My father was a politician. - I remember-- - Now, wait a minute. I've stood this just about long enough. Caroline, what does this man mean to you? If you expect to marry me, I demand a full account of your conduct with him. After all, I have a position to maintain. Try this position. This is too much. All I want is peace and quiet. No, no, no. I wouldn't want a wife like this. Trunk. Trunk. 40. 60. 80. $100.
