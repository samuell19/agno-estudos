It is said that if it poses a kind of intersection here. S my culture ... it is believed that one can and this point with the ancestors ES contact occurred. You mean, you can talk to the dead? We all have ancestors, Master William. The ancestors seem very important to be you. Then you have this place that means a lot. Many know this? No, not many. Only those who were chosen by the ancestors. Are you chosen? My people regarded me as a healer. A man is able to communicate with the unknown. I have a rare gift, Master William.
