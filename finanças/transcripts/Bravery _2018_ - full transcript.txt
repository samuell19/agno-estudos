""Bravery"" This film was produced as a community project to provide a new perspective and remove the stigma attached to the defenders of the settlement. All of the film's historical facts are based upon testimonials of kibbutz members, historical research, and the report of the Inquiry Commission headed by Brigadier General, David Shaltiel The names of the heroes and their characters have been changes. If anyone finds a connection between fiction and fact - so be it. Shibolim Group, this is our first visit to kibbutz since the war. Don't let the destruction scare you. Don't look for things you left behind. Everything burned up or was stolen. But we are strong. Your parents and the other members are rebuilding the kibbutz. You have one hour to meet your parents and walk around the kibbutz. Then, we'll return to Haifa. Look. There's Dad. There's Mom. Dad! -There are Mom and Dad. Dad! Dad! Ami. look. There's Mom Surkah, look who came to visit. -Ami! You're not my mother. Ami, I'll always be your mother. Take me away from here. Great-grandma Surkah, are you happy today? Yes, Tomer. I am happy. "I do not know how the forests hum, "How rooftops are covered with falling snow The flame-tree sang me a melody of storms "And the floWering^Judas-tree tells me ®f the spring. "Here is my home, overlooking the Golan..." Grandma Surkah, what a magnificent tribe you have. yes, Yaeli, it's all thanks to you. YeS;Y‘aeli, its ’all tftegkstoyou. "Here is my home, looking out over the Golan. "My home looks out over the Golan." We are gathered here today to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of the foundation of our kibbutzim, Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah. After seven years of living in a moshava, the long-awaited day arrived. The kibbutz was founded as one of-the-Tower and Stockade settlements near the Yarmuk River, opposite the Golan Heights. That is why we are called Sha'ar HaGolan. (Gate to the Golan) Our neighbors from Massadah join us today. They settled in the valley with us on the same day and share a common history. It is no secret that there has been no great friendship between us over the years, but this is our joint celebration. We are all celebrating eighty years. And actually, after eighty years, we are burying the hatchet and making a new start. Bury‘ng the hatchet? They've been blaming us instead of themselves for the past seventy years. Mishka, we know you are not guilty. You just volunteer to personally accept all the guilt. Right, Dad. Who even remembers what happened between Massadah and Sha'ar HaGolan? Do you think it's something you can forget? I remember. See? I am right. On Friday, May 14th, 1948 Ben Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel. The next morning, Arab armies attacked the young State. Syrian infantry troops with armored vehicles, tanks, and artillery launched a military assault on the Jordan Valley. Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah, located at the entrance to Wadi El Hama suffered incessant bombardments, and a severe lack of water, weapons, communication and medication. Command Headquarters! -How were you wounded? I don't know, Surkah. I was running with two babies to the bomb shelter and suddenly I saw the diaper stained with blood. I was so scared. I thought something happened to the babies. You are so brave, Izzo, getting those children to safety. It's a miracle. I don't believe in miracles, Bronka. If we had dug communication trenches instead of water shafts, the situation would be much simpler. Not that argument again! What could we do? We didn't have the funds. They gave the bulldozer to dig shelters for the older kibbutzim. That's why we don't have shelters. If you want to live in a fortress, you can move to the kibbutzim behind us, on the other side of the road. Command HQ; Do you read me? We are under attack. Tanks, artillery. HQ; Command HQ... -Kubah, Kubah, Kubah. Put down the radio. Can't you see that it's dead? -HQ! Kubah, the shelling cut off all communications. There's no electricity. Command HQ? -Kubah, our kibbutz is strong. But the children. Surkah, what will I do with the children? Kubah, you are the commander. We trust your decisions. Oh no! They are attacking the water pumping station. The guys won't make it. They don't have a chance. -Move. Shooting. Lots of smoke. They're finishing them off. I see people coming out. One, two... Shmuel? They're running towards us. Oh no! Command HQ! HQ! The pumping station has been destroyed. There are casualties. We need reinforcements. We need reinforcements. There were 8 of us over there. Avraham, Ziggy, Moshe, Natan, Shaul... -Hassia, Hassia, now's not the time for that. I need your help. Bring me bandages, okay? During the crossfire, at some point, I saw armored vehicles descending right here, along Wadi el Hama. and spreading out over this area. After the tanks, came the infantry. A massive number. I was very nervous. Just yesterday, we had established the Jewish State and now, the entire Syrian army was trying to destroy us. Well show them what Jewish courage is. Kubah, we have to stop that armored vehicle. Take that spare machine-gun. Run and help them at the El Kasser post. How will they get there? There are no trenches. Everything's exposed. Kubah, I'm taking the machine-gun. No tank is going to stop Bronkah. Let's go, Izzo. We're shooting. The tank stops. It turns around. It's retreating! No. It's turning towards Massadah. There are less fighters at Massadah. Do you think they'll be able to stop the attack? Most of our senior members who fought back then have already passed away. They are with us in our memories and in photographs. When I used to meet with the Jordan Valley security personnel, I always tried... I would beg them: "Help us protect ourselves. Help us dig trenches. "Help us so that well have the strength to see this through." They always answered: "What are you worried about? We're 15 minutes away. "Well send heavy reinforcements to Sha'ar HaGolan. You won't be alone." S® Lgot teQ bullets and a gun and they left us two grenades on thejfloor. I'd never held a grenade. I didn't know how to activate it. They left it for me if things got bad. HQ. HQ; -Kubah, the radio is dead. May God have mercy! So say a prayer for the dead and give me a note. I run faster than that. Write: "We don't have enough people, enough weapons or water." See, Kubah? That's how a Jew fights for his home. Kubah, we're down to our last magazine. We have to ask for more ammunition. I also need medical supplies. I don't have any tourniquets. Headquarters. Headquarters. I want authorization to evacuate the children. We're not evacuating a single living soul! That is an order. That's an order, on principle! -Izzo, well stay to face the entire Syrian army but we are not going to sacrifice our children. Kubah, Kubah, enough. Forget it. Let me run to Afikim. I would get a note from the Histadrut quicker than this. Okay. Write it down. Write. "From the Sha'ar HaGolan administration..." You're a commander, now. Act like one. Not a director. "From the Sha'ar HaGolan headquarters: " e'\/e been under attack since morning. Under attack. "We face tanks, armored vehicles, the infantry. " e have 80 untrained members, 50 guns, 2 rifles without ammunition. " e’ve managed to stop one attack. " e have no water, no electricity. We need reinforcements urgently. " e need reinforcements urgently." You forgot to write: "32 injured cows and a depressed cow-herder." That's not funny, Shmilik. -This is not the time for nonsense. Shmilik, run to Afikim. Run. The water tower has been hit. Now we're left without water, too. e have milk jugs filled with water. Well manage. Kubah is the commander? He never took a course from the "Hagana." He's just a private. It will be okay, Hassia. In all the preliminary meetings, the regional commander promised that if we found ourselves in trouble, reinforcements would be sent from all the posts in the valley. So tell them to send back all the guys they took to defend Gesher and Zemach. All we have left here are a bunch of old geezers and teens. Even your Commander Zeev is guarding Zemach. Hassia, our valley is united. We won't stand alone. Where have you put the scooter, Dad? -Here. It's over here. Ami! There is a large order from the Denmark branch and Chile needs your authorization to add a production line. Sign here. Hi, Sa'ar. Are you abandoning the bananas to work in Dad's factory? Notsp fast. "Golan" only needs one CEO. I came to drag him along on a visit to Grandma Surkah. That's nice’. So talk to her about the vote tonight. A vote to privatize the kibbutz needs a large majority to pass and she refuses to come and vote. Okay, well, let's go. Ready to go? -Go. So what do you say, Dad? ^ill you get the majority v©te?for privatization? Listen, son. We have to privatize. I'm doing it for you, understand? Are you still trying to make decisions for me? Look at me. I'm not a kid anymore. Besid'esrwhat's wrong to stick with the kibbutz when times are tough? You can't trust anybody. No one is really going to come and save me if something goes wrong. Not the kibbutz and not the country. I have to take responsibility for my own life. An'd like Surkah says, if [email protected] don't make a decision, And like Surkah says, if you don't make a decision, you'll be stuck at the bottom. -Stuck at the bottom, yes. VUellJDad. If yojj decided to quote Grandma Surkah, all is well with the world. Yoih're getting soft in your old age. If you only knew how much I suffered because of her, you might understand. Even Degania is an example of the courage of a few against many. The people of Degania were not afraid of the Syrian army and they beat them. They protected the kibbutz borders with their own bodies and didn't let the Syrians pass. They managed to stop them with molotov cocktails, not a small feat because in those days, other kibbutzim in the area disobeyed orders and they also became symbols, but of a different kind. Commander, this lesson sucks. ®o you even know what really happened? Cadet Ami, you did not receive permission to speak. A group of spoiled guys become heroes. "A few against many." Give me a break! And you turned the second group into a group of cowards. First of all, Cadet Ami, calm down. Start with 100 push-ups. Right now. What do we know about the battle of the Deganias? They prevented the invasion of the Arab armies while in other places in the area, two kibbutzim, Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah autonomously decided to desert. They didn't retreat in battle. They chose to evacuate. Do you think you really know what happened there? Who fought and who deserted? You have no idea. I was there from the first shot. Keep it up, Cadet Ami. Now you decide who is a hero and who is a coward. The ones who fought or the ones who ran away. This is for you, Surkah. 21, 22, 23... 24, 25... One, two, three... One, two... Go get the children. Well move them to the bomb shelter. It is too dangerous‘to"take them out now. What if a mortar falls? It's not safe to stay here, either. We have to do something. We don't have a choice. This place is going to blow up. Come on. Well transfer them one by one. Ami, come here. Kids, everyone out. Stand by the door. As soon as we tell you, run the boinb she|ter Ha99ay. are you ready? Yael, out. Hurry. You have to go now. We don't have time. I don't want to. -Yaeli, you must. We're running out of time. No, no, no. -Surkah. Okay. VII Ami, come back here right now. -It's okay, Mom. Let me. Well go together. Yael, I'm scared, too, but we have to be brave together because we can't do this alone, okay? I'm dead! -If you can talk, you're not dead. Don't worry. I'll watch out for you. Okay? -Okay. Ready. One, two, three... We jumped out, one after the other We ran to the shelter and stayed there for two or three days. It was very crowded. At first, we had a bit more room, but then, they brought in the wounded. They hung up a blanket, so a blanket separated us from the wounded. We couldn't sit like that. Four, five... Michal, Dafna. Come here. We have to make room for an infirmary. Three, four, five... They brought us the injured. Two injured from the Yarmuk. They were wounded in the fighting over there. I entered the shelter. All the kids were sitting with their legs folded. They couldn't straighten them out because there was n® room. Where in the name of God would I put everything? Everything had to be clean. Sterile. e cleared out a tiny corner. As big as this. I put the things down on a tin. The doctor sat down, shaking from fear. Dr. Zweig, you have to bandage his leg. Surkah, I don't feel well. There is so much blood. Okay. I can do it by myself. The Syrians were right on the fence. We must evacuate the women and children to the second line. There will be no evacuations without orders from headquarters. We have to evacuate. We can't defend the kibbutz like this. You don't abandon your home, no matter what happens. Thousands of Arabs armed with daggers are waiting in the kibbutz vineyard. They're waiting for their army to break through. Then they will attack. I must get back to my post. -Wait. Hassia, help me. Are you all right? Although many tried to conceal what happened in those days, we know that those defending the kibbutz were an integral part of tine heroic story of the battle over the Jordan Valley. As evidence, we received the Medal of Independence through merit, not as an act of kindness. Right, after six years of begging. What's the difference? Everyone who knows the story, knows we d'esefve it. I am honored to call to the stage the first to receive this honor and be awarded the Medal of Independence. Let's have a round of applause for the one and only, our Surkah! Grandma Surkah, they're waiting for you to receive what you truly deserve. I don't want the medal. I don't believe in medals (also: miracles.) Everyone who thinks that Surkah deserves this medal... Raise your hand. The vote is unafiinTous. ' Grandma, you're hero. By nightfall, I could sense shadows. I told Yehudit "Yehudit "I can see some riffraff or something, a mob of people gathering up." So she said: "Heniya, you know what? Let's fire one shot "to let them know there are people protecting the kibbutz." e didn't really know what was going ®n either. We saw a plane. It might have been one plane ®r two. In any case, it dropped a bomb. Is that Mussa Peled from Nahalal? Did they bring us reinforcements? Mussa! Mussa Peled! m so happy to see you' Kubah, I received orders to join you. I have trained combatants, a radio transceiver and two 20mm cannons. Where do you Want to set them up? The cannons? I suggest on the road to Zemach. I saw many tanks and armored vehicles on the move over there. No problem. Can you ask what we should do about the elderly and the children? don't have room in the shelters. sure thing, Kubah. Trust me. Yonatan, set up the cannon facing Zemach. Entrench yourselves there. Signaler, contact the regiment. Ask about evacuation. Haim, Yossi, go up on the roof with the Bren gun. Dror, help her out with the wounded. I knew we shouldn't give up hope. Everyone else, come with me. We're going on patrol. "The brutal storm wails above us. "Dark powers play as strong as iron. "In the final battle, we will storm our enemies "Our fate may yet be obscure. "Wave our flag. The light shines before us. "Soldiers, leaders, brothers, have faith. "May we remain strong. May our actions be brave..." Okay guys. We're going to dance in pairs now. So couple up. Let's begin. Remember! When the music ends, the girls take a step forward. Go! Smile! Skip! Turn around! Skip! The girts step fo^ard' Hey, hey! Shimmy, didn't anyone at Beit Zera ever teach you to let go? You Sha'ar HaGolan guys are experts at giving up. Champions of letting g®. Keep going. Keep going. Cowards will always be cowards. What did you say? Guys, guys, guys! Shimmy, Ami! What's wrong with you? Cut it out! We don't raise a hand against anyone over here. Sha'ar HaGolan guys are experts at holding their hands up. Shimmy, Ami! Stop it! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Look at what you're fighting about. Shimmy, Shimmy! -I'm a coward? I'm a coward?! I'll break it up. I'll break it up. Ami, Ami. Ami. Look at me. Look at me. I'm angry, too. Trust me. Let's go outside. Okay, guys. Let's continue. Let's continue. Smile! Skip! "I do net know how the forests hum, "How rooftops are cohered in a splendid snowfall. "The flame.~tree .sang me a melody of storms, "And the flowering Judas-tree tells me of the spring. "Here is my Home" Why are you so angry with him? Whenever he loses, he pulls out his nasty innuendoes about Sha'ar HaGolan Why does that make you mad? It's not your fault. Semetimes I think that back then... everybody jus-t ehickened out. Well, I remember a brave boy who held my hand down in the shelter. Like this? Yes. Like that. And he stroked my hajr r Like this? I would stay here like this until the morning. Only if you agree to be njy girlfriend. Only if you ask nieely. Please. Is that nice enough? Look! What? Exactly like the one my father found. He found lots of arrowheads and pottery. sn't this beautiful? Yehuda said that many years ago, a very special civilization populated the banks of the Yarmuk. Look. There's something here. Look! It is so beautiful! What is it? It is a statue of a woman. It is gorgeous. Look at those breasts. Venus. It is a statue of a pagan goddess. Look how pretty it is. When I get out of the army, I want to study archeology. Really? Are you nuts? Who learns archeology? Who even wants to learn anything? -I do. Join me on the banana farm. I'll teach you how to grow bananas that weigh 40 kilos. Ami, I'm not kidding. I want... I want to go to college. I want to discover what happened here thousands of years ago, even if it means I'll have to leave the kibbutz. On'ce you set you mind on'something, you always get it done. You also know how to do whatever you want. That's true. "Like the jujubes I shook out of the tree, "Like th'e sprinklers I spun beneath in the burning heat, "Like the birds that woke me up with their voices, "Here is my home, "Overlooking the Golan." What? mat did I do? I'm safeguarding the principles of HaShomer HaTzair. During the Battle of Attrition, the kibbutz had to withstand 4 years of bombardaments and infiltration from the Jordan Border The children slept in the shelters every night, all the time, without their parents. Every morning, scouts went to check for mines on the paths to the fields. Goingvout to the fields was only allowed after the scouts' approval. When mines exploded in the orchards, Surkah never hesitated. She would go out and tend to the wounded. Yaeli. Ami. What are you doing here. I thought I was the only person who liked this place. You know I'm sentimental about this bridge. I always stop here before I go home. I've been on kibbutz for two weeks already. I didn't dare ask Surkah where you were. I am a commander on Suez canal. That's why I didn't get out, but... Now, things have finally calmed down over there. Do you have time or is Surkah waiting for you? Surkah can manage without me and I can manage without her. Well, you always were courageous when it came to managing alone even though some girls at sohool tried to break you. Yaeli... -How does it go? You know who I picked over everyone else. Right? And who was my girlfriend for 3 years and then chose to leave the kibbutz? Why didn't you write t® me? You decided to go t® America so you went to America. What ®®uld I do? Idiot. -What? You're an idiot because you never wrote to me, and you never said anything and I almost... So? You are always so... -So what? Cool. As if you don't care. missed you. So did I. Yaeli' Check fh^- Check them. Tell the ambulance where to go. Hey, stay with me! Stay with me! Surkah! It's okay, Roberta. I'm here. Are you hurt, Ami? Wait. Look. I'm okay. It's not my blood. When did you get back? I got a short leave but I think there's more action here than in the canal. I was so worried about you. It's okay. Everything is all right. One, two, three. They are taking care of her. Ami, I have to go. I'm listed to work in the shelter for the fourth graders. Surkah, I'm going too. Wait. Are you crazy? You can't go. The roads are mined. It's dangerous. Surkah, I can manage by myself. Ami, come with me to the car. Get in. Surkah. I'm a big boy now. I learned to manage without my mother. -My shW is no longer a boy "His eyes are still a pool of blue "But his look is one of fire. "He returned to me so different..." Shibolim group, come on. Do you want to hear a story? -Yes. aforv time- Come to stoi y Come on, kids. -I want my mother. I want my mother. Your mother will come at bedtime, okay? Let's sit down. But I'm scared. I want my mother. -I know. I know. Let's sit down. Imagine it's like... Bursting balloons. A blue balloon. A red balloon. Children, come listen to a story. -Okay. Well, only part of a story. I'll begin and then you help me finish. Okay? Yes. -Okay. This is a story about a sweet little girl. Her name is... Sigalit. Sigalit had a balloon. What color was it? Blue. -Purple. Okay. Sigalit had a purple balloon. Then the children met Mitzi, Sigalit's kitty-cat. Mitzi scratched the purple balloon with her sharp claws and suddenly... Boom, pop! What happened? The balloon-burst. The balloon popped. Maybe there were more balloons. -Yes. Maybe there were more children? -Yes. That way, everyone could play with balloons and if one popped, they could play with the rest of them. That's a good idea. How about a boy whose name is...? Gad? -Dan? Ron. And Ron had a yellow balloon. The children met F?©n's father. Ron was happy. He said: "Father, blow up the yellow balloon for me. "Blow it up . | warot a bi® ballgpn. Father blew and blew and blew and suddenly: Boom; Pop: What happened? -The balloon burst. The balloon popped. Again. Boom! Pop! What happened? The balloon burst. The balloon popped. Boom! Pop! What happened? -The balloon burst. The balloon popped. Boom! Pop! What happened? Boom! Pop! What happened? I'll be right back. Don't go. Vm seated. Don't worry. I'll be right over there. You can see me. You are Yonatan, from the reinforcements, right? -Yes. How did you get injured? The Syrians fired directly at my cannon. They demobilized us. At least there is another cannon. How will we stop the tanks? What will happen if they reach the shelter? They'll massacre us all. Don't worry, Hassia. We are a division of the Palmach. We can protect you. e will surely receive authorization to evacuate the children soon. But how? Yudka has been on the tower signaling all day and night and we still haven't received a reply. Don't worry. Come, Yonantan. We're pulling out. Mussa, are y®u leaving us? Yes, Surka'h.,.1 reeeived orders. We must prepare to defend Degania. You're leaving us alone? Why? What happened? We received notice that the police at Zemaeh are in dire straights. They've suffered many losses and need reinforcements immediately. Raffi is at Zemach. And Yehoshua, from my group. Your Zeev is at Zemach. -What? At Zemach? Do you know who? No. I'm somy, Surkah. I really dammit know. e have to move. I am sure you will receive more reinforcements soon. Meanwhile, you are strong. Hang in there. Protect the kibbutz. We will win in the end. Let's go, Yonatan. Did you hear that, Ami? We are strong. We will win. Hi, Granny. How are you? -Hello, kids. Did you come to take Grandma out to graze? Surkah, why don't you get up and take a walk outside? Get some fresh air? What do you want from me? I'm tired. I have enough fresh air from the window. Besides, I spoke to Tomer and she said she would come this evening to watch a movie with me on the big television. Grandma, you remember we're coming to take you to vote on kibbutz tonight? Yes and no. No? Yes, I remember, yes,' remember but no, I'm not coming. Surkah, your vote is important. Important? Who is important? Me? vm still here just by mistake. Oh Grandma, cut it out. You know that your opinion is important. I'm not going. -Why not, Grandma? Don't you care about what will happen to the kibbutz? Or to Tomer's future? Sa'ar, Tomer's future will only be secure after privatization. Are you Starting up again? Talking about money again? -Yes, again, because there are other ways. We'\/e spoken about this millions of times. That's not the point. Quiet. Quiet'. Listen to me. I know exactly what is good for the kibbutz and how to vote but it is a decision about your future. I already fought for the kibbutz. I already made my decisions. Now it is your turn. Hello, hello. Good evening. -Hi. Hello. -How's it going? Hello, Bruria. -Hello, Ami. How is everything in the factory? Is everything all right? Not just all right. Excellent. So, Bruria, you're going to vote tonight, right? -What a question. I'll vote and the children, too. "No" to privatization! How are you, Shmilik? She didn't agree to leave. -What? Back then, in '48, she said: "Shmilik, listen to me," so I listened. What? I swore not to tell, but remember that Surkah refused to leave. If course she didn't leave. She'd sell her life for the common good. That Shmilik is crazy. The district commander is busy. What do you want? I am Shmilik from Sha'ar HaGolan. I must see Avrum. e've been signaling since yesterday and have gotten no response. Remain in place. That's the order. The commander is in a meeting. And i anr right here. e have no ammunition left. They took our division and our cannons. The situation in Massadah is worse. They have no weapons. I must get answers. He can't see you now. You can leave a note with the adjutant. Thanks, Avrum. I'm bring the Leyland back by tomorrow afternoon. Hi, Shmilik. How are things going by you? A catastrophe and a mess. Not enough fighters, and one hundred children in a single bomb shelter. You still haven't evacuated them? Can't you see? The entire valley is evacuating children and more. Can't you see what's going on here? The entire valley is being evacuated and no one told us anything? Calm down, Shmilik. We received orders. We are evacuating everything: Children, equipment, cows. Everything. Now I understand, Tulikah. What an idiot I am. Now I get it. From now on, we're all alone. Avrum! Avrum, do you hear me? If you donVt some out right now, I'll cause a scandal. Avrum, come out! Now! What is that noise? Shmilik? What do you want? "From... from the head of Sha'ar. For three days, we've been asking what to do and no reply. Nothing! You tooKour reinforcements. Did you explain why? No. Zemach fell eight hours ago. Did'you let us know that we were surrounded? No. Everyone is evacuating the children. Tulikah got a Leyland bus to evacuate the cows. And us? Nothing. Nothing but nothing! What is going on? Did you forget Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah? Calm down, Shmilik. A war is going on. This is not a marketplace. You think that your kibbutzim are the most important things. There is a fierce battle going on in Degania. I don't have time to deal with an evacuation. But if you're here, I'll write you a note. "To Kubah, Settlement Commander, from the District Command. "You are authorized to evacuate all children under the age of 12 "and all other non-combatant parties. "You must be ready to defend the kibbutz relentlessly, unconditionally. "Signed: Avrum, District Command." Mom! Hanna, I don't know if we will see one another again. Take care of Yaeli. Raise her as we always dreamt. Come, Yaeli. Let's go. Ami, let's go. Did you see my mother There she is. Doctor Zweig, what are you doing? I went through the Holocaust. I am not willing to go through that again. Surkah, you have the right to refuse. Mom? -Ami... Get in the truck. Come with me. All the mothers are going with their children. Haggay's mother and Yael's mother and... Ami, I can't leave. I must stay. I promise I will be watching over you from here. You have to come. If you don't come, you'll die. You have to come, now. Now! -Ami. I am not going. But remember what I promised. If you don't come, then I don't need you anymore, you hear me? If you don't come, I'll manage by myself, remember that. Ami, my boy, I will come to you the moment I can. -Surkah. Surkah! Surkah, come quick. Haim is wounded. He's bleeding. You must come. Ami, get on the truck. Ami. Ami! Let's go! Come on, Ami. -Come. Come on, Ami. -Come. You have to get in now. A few fighting many. The warriors at Degania fight off the iron monsters. Man was victorious..Not the tanks. The Jordan Valley was saved. Like the birds that woke me up with their voices, "Here is my home, overlooking the Golan." We will begin with an item just in from Yossi Priel in the Golan Heights. A senior officer on the Syrian border summed up the day's operations and let us-krww what to expect tomorrow. We foroedibaek the troops who managed to infiltrate a number of areas in the Golan Heights on the first day of battle. Israeli citizens, there is no reason to despair. Heaven forbid.' VVe-have no doubt that-in-the-end of the war, we will be the victors. Surkah, Yaeli. Ami? But when they attack us, we will fight until the victory. Let's hope that it won't be long until the war comes to an end, with Israel victorious. It's not possible. It's not possible. You must go to Tzefat. You must identify him. Yaeli, come... Well go together. The two of us. He promised me. You are our children. You are the children of us all. Well meet again soon,I hope, after the great victory of the Israeli army. Prepare to receive the commander! Avrum. Finally. Finally. I have so many questions. Yudkeh hasn't been able to receive answers. Tell me, what is going on in the valley? Is Degania still standing? Massadah? What is going on in Massadah? Is there ammunition? Reinforcements? -Kubah, Kubah, Kubah. Calm down. There is no news. The war continues and there are no new orders. Now that only soldiers are left here, I expect full obedience. Soldiers? I have 50 comrades here, without ammunition, exhausted at their posts. No electricity, no water, no backup. Avrum, how can we continue? You will not receive reinforcements. All of our forces are concentrating on the Degania-Afikim road. Be strong and stay put. Kubah, the reason I came here is to reprimand you. -For what? You decided by yourself to evacuate children above the age of 12. But the communication lines are down. -That's not what the orders said. Okay, whatever. At least you are still holding on. Now fight until the end. You are our Stalingrad. Don't ever give up. It seems that you are giving up on us. Shmilik, this war is about the State of Israel, not about your jokes. Over at your headquarters, you think that we can stand against the entire Syrian army all by ourselves? How will we stop them? With our bare hands? And do you think, that I, Avrwm, the grandson of Haim from the HaShomer Organization will issue an order to retreat? You must be crazy’ Avrum, Avrum, Avrum, at least come with me to the posts, visit the fighters, lift their spirits. don't have time for that. Be strong and be brave. I can't do this anymore. The cows are driving me crazy. They're bursting with milk and I can't help them. It's driving me nuts. -Berl, Berl, Berl. Even an experienced dairy farmer such as you understands that it is too dangerous to go out right now. I can't. I must. Berl, Berl, Berl! -| must. Kubah, we will hold on. We're going to Berl. We'll be back quickly. Come, come, girls. I told you, Gila. Everything will be all right. -In Massadah, in the dairy farm -The milk is thick as tar "And we only have skim milk, "But Berl is stiff p "And we only have skim milk, "But Berl is still proud. 'In Massadah, the girls "Are all beauties. They are all pretty. "BUt by us-in Sha'ar HaGolan, "We don't have beautiful girls. "But by us in Sha'ar HaGolan AI1 the 9'rls are beautiful." Someone is coming. Who's there? Who's there? Mishkeh from Massadah? What are you doing here? My friends, where are the headquarters? I have a message from the fighters who are defending Massadah. Come with me. I'll take you there. Berl, don't stay here long. It is dangerous. Even Gila isn't worth it. Go on. Kubah. Kubah, Mishkeh from Massadah is here. Mishkeh? What are you doing here? As neighbors, it is our obligation to tell you about our situation. By us, some are ill, we have only a few weapons, and our ammunition is almost gone. We won't be able to keep on like this. We won't be able to hold on. We are consicfering pU(/jng ouL I would like to consult with you and decide together. This is hard, Mishkeh. We will not leave without an order. Are you speaking on behalf of the Massadah command? I'm speaking on behalf of myself and many kibbutz members. We are asking you to discuss it and let us know what you decide. What should we do? The tanks will surround us and we won't be able to retreat. You can retreat in battle, too. Even in the Warsaw ghetto, they fought tanks with their bare hands. And who won? As soon as the tanks attack, we won't have a chance. e can't lose time. e must pull out now, organize a proper military force and return with reinforcements. If we don't do that, we will end up like Gush Etziyon where everyone was either killed or taken prisoner. Kubah, we must vote. It takes a lot of courage to retreat, no less than it does to die. We will have to live with the consequences of our deeds. e have been fighting all alone for four days. Despite all their promises, they only sent us sandwiches and water as they entrenched themselves behind us, in their fortified posts. Don't you understand? They abandoned us. They are afraid to give the command to stay or to retreat. That will be our decision and ours alone. So what do you suggest? -What is there to suggest? e received an order, and we're like Tel Hai, defending the homeland. I'm staying here to fight until the last bullet is fired. Did you consider what might happen to you if you remained without bullets? That could really be a problem. We all know what will happen to us if we remain. We can't ignore the logic in the words of Mishkeh from Massadah. But I cannot decide to leave without an order. I just can't. I cannot. I just cannot. I cannot. I cannot do this anymore. Berl, replace me, please. You make the decision. Maybe we should postpone the vote until tomorrow? Berl, I am not sure that the Syrians will agree to postpone till tomorrow. I would like to say something. This is my fault, Yaeli. I raised him to be like that. He never consulted me about his career in the army. I know that we are very, very important to him. Important... He promised me that he would protect me and now he went to be a big hero, just like you and his father. A hero? Me? Yaeli, there are still so many things that you don't know and I cannot tell you. I think I saw Ami. Stop. Stop! Ami! They told us that you were killed, that your body is in Tzefat. I switched coats with my deputy battalion commander. There must have been a mistake in the identification. Stop being such a hero. I need you in my life. She's right, Ami. You have already done your part. Our cemetery is full of dead people. You're right. Surkah We ha'/e en°ugh dead. We finally agree on something. It* Was a terrible predicanrent. It was a terrible predicament. It is hard for me to describe how we got past it. You heard more than once: "Oh, the ones who ran away." That's what they would say. Shimon Avidan said it was disgraceful to leave a kibbutz, a settlement. The concept was*that-a.prQtected, Jewish settlements' would never pull out, absolutely not. But in this situation, citizens Were on the front lines, and the array was behind, that is a fast. If you want to create a line of defense and draw the line from Degania A and B to Beit Zera, Afikim, etc. and declare that this is the line of defense that we want to maintain, then you should use the same logic not just to allow, but to order Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadab and Mussa Peled to pull back and retreat to those settlements. If you're talking about military considerations. What happened? No one told them anything, and they were left, high and dry. And you, Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah, perpetuate this guilt and continue to carry this blemish voluntarily. Don't lose hope, Surkah. Let time take its course. You have to keep your head high. Look, we've returned home. We will rebuild, restore and renew. Well have a beautiful kibbutz, okay? Now, we have a mission. We have to rebuild our home. "Here is my home; overlooking the Golan, "Surrounded by orchards and vineyards..." Let us welcome the Head of Command in Reserves. He will award the Medal of the War of Independence to all of the fighters from Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah. A long time ago, I read the report written by the inquiry commission of Brigadier General, Shaltiel regarding the retreat of Sha'ar HaGolan and Massadah. The report was sealed for forty years but has been available to all for a number of decades already. The verdict of the Brigadier General is very clear-cut: I have no doubt that these communities deserve to hold their heads high and they hav.e-e^ery right to live lives of honor in their communities." You are most worthy of this honor, the Medal of Independence, and so I would like/to award the Medal of Independence to Surkah, who fought with great bravery and courage in the battles of the War of Independence of the State of Israel. Surkah, Surkah, Surkah! I want to tell you a secret. Then, in '48, on that night, in the command's bomb shelter, •when we had to>rjnake that decision, there was a very big argument. Some-thought... Friends, there is no question at all. We received an order, and well stay here until our last drop of blood. But what purpose will it serve, Izzo? Just to die? Can we stop the tanks? Don't you understand? We are a suicide regiment. There is no sense to that. We must pull back to Afikim. Well get back our strength and gather other fighters, and return to conquer the place. Berl, 1 can't leave my home. I planted those trees here with my blood. Every shell that hits my garden, tears my heart apart. I can't leave my home. I can't. Shmilik, what do you say? Is there a question? I'm asking you. Stay till the end or retreat? Look, Kubah, it is obvious that... We don't stand a chance. And it's also clear that the line of defense in the kibbutzim behind us is very strong and much better fortified. Our fall will not influence the outcome of the battle. So you are in favor of the retreat. No way. I'm in favor of staying. don't understand. I am not afraid of dying. But did you think about what will happen if we leave our home? How will everyone look at us? What kind of a role model will we be for our children? How can we show our faces in the valley? What will they say about us in the kibbutz movement? You think you need courage to stay? I am scared to retreat. He is right. We need to set an example. e will stay until the end. I want to say something. Up until now, I thought the same as Bronka and Izzo, that I am willing to give my life for this land. But I promised my son, Ami, that I wouldn't leave him, that I would remain by his side, and I cannot break that promise. It may be difficult to understand that feeling, and... and he may never forgive me. Sometimes, I don't know what is better: To be a heroic role model or just... a mother. Now I understand that if I want him to have a good future, I must stay alive. For him. I am in favor of retreat. Friends, what happened here tonight must remain a secret. We made a collective decision and that is how it must remain, forever. But you said she didn't agree to leave. She didn't agree to leave you. I also have something to say to Surkah, to my mother. For the past seventy years, I've been carrying around this idea that my mother, the hero, preferred to die here on this land, instead of coming with me and taking care of me. I ask your forgiveness, Mother, for not understanding you that you gave up everything, your home, your honor, for-me. Mother, this award is yours and you deserve it, along with all those who did everything so that we can be here today. Come, Grandma Surkah, well go together. Come, Mishkeh. The Medal of Independence belongs to us all. Surkah, Surkah, Surkah! Why are you crying, Great-Grandma? You said that you were happy today. Yes, Tomer. I am happy.
