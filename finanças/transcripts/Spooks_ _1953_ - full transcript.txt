Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Where? Gentlemen, you! Oh! Okay. We'll be right with you. Yes, sir. We'll be with you before you can say Fort Ticonderoga. If you can say Fort Ticonderoga. If you can say anything. Please, gentlemen. You may prevent a murder. - What did you do? - Who'd you kill? Who do you want us to cover up for? Give us the story. Gentlemen, last night my daughter went down to the corner of First and Jay Streets to buy a paper. That was 26 hours ago and I haven't heard from her since. I'm afraid to go to the police. Why? If she's been abducted, she may come to harm. What's the name, please? George B. Bopper. Oh, a be-bopper! Dig that crazy Bopper name! He-beep-beep-beep. Cool, man. Real George. Give me some skin. Give me some skin. Oh! Oh! Ow, ow, ow! Give me a blotter, will you? Give me a blotter. Here. Here's a picture of my daughter, Mary. Roll along, mister. We'll bring her back alive. Listen, boys, we'll use the pie demonstration routine. We'll go into the neighborhood of First and Jay Street, canvass from house to house, giving away sample pies. We'll keep our eyes open and try to find the girl. It won't work. Nobody gives away samples at night. We'll tell 'em we've got to give away a quota and can't go home until we're through. It won't work and I ain't going. Uh! Oh, yeah? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ow! Now, what did you say? I said it would work perfectly. What are we waiting for? Nothing. Come on. Ow, ow, ow! Oh, no. Wait a minute. Careful of the pie boxes, fellas. Don't lick the pies. Now, remember what we gotta do. What a crummy neighborhood. Yeah, it's spooky. We gotta start someplace around here if we wanna find the girl. Yeah, we'd better take another look at her picture so we'll recognize her. That girl has a beautiful pair of eyes. You might as well sit still, my dear, you can't escape. You will feel no pain, Miss Bopper. Heh. We'll simply put you to sleep, then transfer your brain in place of that of the gorilla's. Science will salute you for a marvelous... A girl just screamed! Hey, it came from inside the house. Let's investigate. Let's go home and investigate tomorrow, huh, Moe? Quiet, coward. Oh! Ow! I can't see. I can't see. What's the matter? I got my eyes shut. Oh! They're open. They're open. Hey, the door is locked. Let's try the window. Come on. All right, get on it now. Okay. All right. Oh! Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Moe. Ow, ow, ow! We've got to open that one. Tote that board. All right. Rip those nails. Let's go. Heave ho. Dr. Jekyll. Yes, Mr. Hyde? We'd better gag her and tie her on the operating table. Yes, bring her over. Good, good. I'll go prepare the gorilla. Easy, kid. All right, get in there, Larry. Here you are, kid. Okay. Easy now, Congo. This hypodermic will put you to sleep and when you wake up, you'll be human. The vicious beast. What's the matter with you? Are you still scared? N-n-n... Yes. Why don't you be calm? Take a look through the window. There's nothing in there to get scared of. Go ahead. Oh! Moe, we're trapped like rats. Speak for yourself. Ow! Come on. Ohh! Oh! What's the matter with you? This joint gives me the spooks. It looks like it's haunted. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Haunted houses have bats. Yeah, that's right. There's no bats here. I always... Help! What a hideous, monstrous face! Oh! Ah! Whoa! It's coming back! Whoa! Whoa! Ah, blood is correct. Doc, I tell you, there's somebody in this house. Yes. Let's go see. Gosh, I wish I'd have stayed home. All right, so there was a little bat. You know, we're silly. There's nothing to fear. There's nothing in this place to hurt us. We'd better get rid of these men before they find out what's going on. Right. I got you, boss. Larry, you and I search the place. Shemp, you stay here and guard. Couldn't we all stay here and guard, huh, fellas, couldn't we? Do as you're told. Come on, Larry. I'd better be c-c-calm. After all, there's n-n-no spooks to be scared of. Or is there? Darn that shoelace, it's always untied. Oh! Moe! Larry! Moe! Larry! Moe! Larry! Oh! Hey! Shemp's in trouble! Come on! Larry! Come on, will you? Hurry up. Moe! Larry! What's wrong? A knife almost cut my head in two. It took my hat and... What happened? Oh, you idiot you! What's wrong with you? Larry, you stand guard. I'll take mush-head with me. What's in your mouth? Nothing. Ahh! Come on. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ah. Moe! Shemp! Shemp! Moe! You... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Moe! Shemp! Shemp! Moe! Come here quick. Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up! What's the matter? A cleaver tried to cleave me in half. It stuck in the wall... You see, there's something fishy here. Yeah, you two suckers. Ow! Go on. You two guys go on and search the house, see if you can find the girl. I'll stand guard. Go on! Hurry! Oh, a dead cow. You're crazy. That's an elk. Now, come here. One thing to remember, we got to search every nook and cranny. What's a cranny? This! Ow! Oh, oh! The closet. Go ahead. Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, mama! Oh, I didn't know it was you, Larry. I didn't know it was you. Oh, you did it, eh? I didn't know... Say, is there a bump on my head? No. Ow! Ow! Ow! Pretty soon, young lady. Come in. When I was a kid, I loved these Roman candles. Shemp! Larry! Yeah? Somebody tried to cut my head off with a sickle. Now do you believe us? Hey, I bet a brass nickel somebody's trying to scare us out of this place, that's what. You can say that again. I bet a brass nickel somebody's trying to scare us out of this place, that's what. I... Hey, did you say that? No. I said it. Well, why don't you stop butting in. How do you like that ugly-looking...? Hey, it's out of juice. Ow! Oh! Ow! Ohh! Oh. Hey, there's a window. Quick, let's get out of here. We should have gone home like he said, you stubborn mule. Ow! Ow! Why, you... Get away from here. I... Get out! Get away from here. Oh! Oh! Wait a minute, Moe, wait. We gotta figure a way out of here. And now, Miss Bopper, we shall proceed with the operation. Nothing withstanding. Oh, my nose. Why, you... Why, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. What a silly way to make tea. Oh, it isn't tea, it... Hello? It's for you. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm losing my mind! Why you... Don't! Please, no! I'll get you. No, no, Dr. Jekyll. Doctor Jekyll? We must hide. Stand back or I'll brain you. Yes, you'd better run, you coward. I'll club your brains out. Oh, calm yourself, Miss Bopper. Catch your breath. I got my eyes glued on that door, and if he comes back here, I'll split his skull with this. Matter of fact, I think I'll go out after him. I'll break him in... Ma! Run! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, come on, kid. Come on. You wait here. I'll get the boys and then we'll get out of here. Fellas, I found the girl and that great big chimney-pansy, he looked just like my mother-in-law. He had a big hooked nose... That vicious animal, he's loose. He tried to choke me out there. Now, wait a minute, wait. Calm yourself. Be like me, calm. Have a cigarette everybody. There's nothing to worry about. Ow, ow, ow, ow! The door! Open it, Moe! Ow, oh, oh, oh. How do you like that? Ah! Hey, man the guns. Oh. Let's get 'em. Here. I'll cleave your skull, you... Aim, fire! Let's get out of here! Retreat, doctor, retreat! They foxed us. I'll get 'em. Ow! Ow! Hold your fire. I've got an idea. Come on. When they come out, I'll bash their heads in, then I'll get the keys and then I'll... Ah, ah. No, no, no, no. No, no, no! There's a trapdoor over here. Come on. Ow! Oh! Where is it? In here. Come on, hide in here! Larry, the handcuffs. Ah. Victory! Come on, let's get the cops. Don't do it! Don't! Hmm. I hate vanilla. Oh! They really got it.
