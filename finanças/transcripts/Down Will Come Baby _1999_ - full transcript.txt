[SLOW AND SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW AND SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MARCUS: Honey, you've been working so much and traveling so much, we hardly even see anymore. LEAH: I told you before I went to Chicago that I had to go to Portland. No, no. You did not say tonight. I'll be back by Wednesday. Honey, we agreed that we would do this for six months, it's been almost a year. Well, when you decided to become an architect, it took five years. Yeah, but I was home every night. Look, you think I like this? Do you think I like leaving my family and having to carry this stupid case across the country? MARCUS: Why can't you just stay managing the office? LEAH: Because in a couple of months we're gonna have a down payment for a house. Couple of months turns into another year, meantime what? I don't have a wife, you don't have a husband. What about Robin? The girl needs you as much as I do, especially now, the school year's coming to a close, she's got a recital...[FOOTSTEPS CLATTERING] Robin! Wait, is she gone?Yeah. She probably heard us. I promised her we wouldn't start arguing about this. CALVIN: Hey, Robin. What's up? [SKATEBOARD CLATTERS] Just wanted to get out for a while. My mom's so obsessed with buying a house, that's all she talks about. She wants me to have a yard and a dog and all the other things she had as a kid. So she's out working this stupid job and my dad has to drive me around, do the shopping, the cooking, the laundry, and plus he's got his own job. Bummer. I think if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't have all these problems. [SIGHS] Sometimes I wish I could just disappear for a while. Well, maybe you could do what I did last summer. [CUTLERY CLATTERING] MARCUS: Okay, how about antonym. A-N-T-O-N-Y-M. Excellent work. Do you remember that camp I used to go to? The one I took the bus to? Clearlake Summer Camp. I was wondering if I could go there again this summer. Oh, I already signed you up for that program at the zoo. Have you paid for it? I paid for the first week. Seventy-five dollars. Can you get it back? No, that was non-refundable. Suppose I paid you back for it? Honey, you've had all year to earn money, you didn't do it. That is called a consequence. I believe that is one of your spelling words. She's 12 years old. You know, how many more summers does she have to be a child. MARCUS: This isn't about her being a child. LEAH: Everything doesn't have to be a lesson. Everything is a lesson. You give in on this, I'll tell you what's going to happen. Someday she's going to get into serious trouble, and when she does, I don't wanna look back and wish that we had taught her more about consequences. You know, this hasn't been an easy time for her. So maybe we should, uh, give in to her this once. You know what you are?Hmm? You are a softy. Well, you say you've always liked my soft spot. So don't go changing on me now, boy.[LAUGHS] WOMAN: Paul Taylor.[INDISTINCT CHATTER] Angela StrongYeah. Billy... You give us a call when you get there. [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] MARCUS: Give us a wave. I promise not to give away your bedroom. ROBIN: Bye.Have fun, sweetie pie. LEAH: Bye, darling. ALL: Bye! Love you! Bye-bye! Oh, here. What's this?Open it. An ongoing date?Mm-hmmm. It was Robin's idea. So now whenever you come into town, we'll go out for at least one date. Whether it's dinner or a movie or... just a walk in the park. She's a terrific kid. Yeah, she sure is. Oh... I miss her already. ALL: Bye-bye. Bye! [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHANTING] WOMAN: Twelve to 14-year-old girls with Brina. There's Brina. Boys with Jake. Let's see. I only have two in my group, so you must be Amelia and Robin. Yeah, I'm Robin. Nice to meet you. My name's Brina. And you must be Amelia? Okay. Let's head to the cabin. Why don't you guys pick your bunks. Get unpacked while I go teach my swimming lesson. I'll meet you back at the main lodge where the bus left you off at noon. You'll hear the lunch bell. After lunch, I'll even give you a tour of the camp. Okay.Okay, all right, I'll see you later. Bye! So, um, do you want the top or the bottom? "Why don't you take the top, Robin?" "Don't mind if I do." [GRUNTS] Is this your first time here? It's my first time anywhere. You go to school, don't you? Yeah. So that's somewhere. I think. I was here when I was eight. Nothing's changed. It even smells the same. What grade are you in? I'm going into seventh. Oh, me too. [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER] [SIGHS] So, how'd you decide to come to camp? It was Momma's idea. You didn't wanna go?No. Well, how about this for weird. It was my idea to go to camp, but I didn't wanna go either. [LOUD CHATTER] Mmm... Mm-mmm. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] You know what this reminds me of?Mm-hmm. This reminds me of that little hotel that we found in Nova Scotia, do you remember that? [GASPS] In the rain with you.Yeah. Aw... The Italian chef. Hmm. That's right.Uh-huh. Do you remember where we went afterwards? The tower. Uh-Huh. The tower...Uh-huh... Climbing up there in the dark. Can you believe it?[MARCUS LAUGHS] I can't believe what we did up there. Oh...We should go back there. We should go back this summer. I would love to. You know there's something else we should talk about.Hmm? There is a possibility that I'm going to be offered a position at the corporate office. Where? In Denver? I'll be overseeing both coasts. I'll be making half again as much as I am now, and I won't have to travel so much. I thought we were gonna save up the money for the down payment and you were gonna work here again. WAITER: Can I take that for you? Thank you. [SIGHS] I didn't know this was gonna happen. So then, what about my career? I mean, I... You know, I'm just getting started, but, um... I'm with a good firm. I'm with people that I love working with. [SIGHS DEEPLY] We have... We have a history here. We've got our friends here. What about Robin? She may like the idea. ROBIN: I was supposed to go to this really good program at the zoo. How come you came to camp if you didn't want to? I don't know. I just thought my parents would get along better if I wasn't around. What about you? Do your parents fight much? It's just me and Momma. And we never fight. You never fight with your mom? She says fighting is bad. Well, we're fighting right now. No, we're not.Yes, we are. We're fighting about fighting. We're even fighting about whether or not we're fighting. You're weird. Hey, wait. Hold that pose. No, don't.What's the matter? I don't like people taking my picture. Why not? Mom is always doing that. I always have to smile even if I don't want to. So frown, I don't care. Grr![CAMERA CLICKS] GIRL: Hey, Robin, think fast. [EXCLAIMS][LAUGHING] So, if you don't fight with her, what do you do when you get mad at her? AMELIA: I never do. Everybody gets mad. Yeah, but if I let her know I get punished. How does she punish you? Different ways. Oh! That reminds me. I have to do something. You have to eat. The bell just rang. Save you a place. [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You missed dinner. I had to finish my letter. You wrote to her this morning. Brought you something.Thanks. I have to write her twice a day.She told you that? How many pages is that? She wants me to tell her everything that happens. Most of it is about you. What'd you say? Well, just something like... Like you're mean and ugly and stupid.What! I'm kidding. Here you can read it. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] I'm starting to get some pressure about that job in Denver. So, would you at least think about it? Honey, I have thought about it. My mind's made up. I went out and took some pictures today of some houses I thought we could afford. Wait, wait. You're taking pictures of houses. Well, I just wanted to show 'em to you. Leah, I can understand you wanting to get a house, I can understand you wanting to give Robin all the things that you had when you were a kid. But she can have all of that right here in Phoenix. Yeah, you'll be able to make a lot more money in Denver, we can get a bigger house, but you know what, we don't need that. What we need is for you to come back here and be a part of this family. ♪ Miss Lucy had a baby, She named him Tiny Tim! ♪ She put him in the bathtub To see if he could swim ♪ He drank up all the water He ate up all the soap ♪ He tried to eat the bathtub But it wouldn't go Down his throat Let's go. ♪ Miss Lucy called the doctor Miss Lucy called the nurse ♪ Miss Lucy had a baby She named him Tiny Tim! ♪ She put him in the bathtub To see if he could swim That's great.

Should we go? Come on, let's get you home. Thanks. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] It was my fault. Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault. It was my idea. You didn't make her go into the water. I talked her into it. Yeah, and you did everything that you could to save her. Sweetheart... It was a terrible accident that happened to somebody that you cared about. But it wasn't your fault. She was my best friend at camp. LEAH: The one you wrote to us about. Yeah. Would you like us to call her parents, uh, about the funeral. It's just her mom. Would you like me to call her mom? [SOBBING] No... Ah, sweetheart... I wish I could put my arms around you. [SIGHS] I'll be there as fast I can. I'm on the next plane out. Anything you wanna do at home? Not really. You sure? Anything at all? No. I think she needs to see a therapist. I'll make some calls tomorrow. See if I can find someone for her to talk to. Can't hire somebody for her to talk to. What do you think she needs? She needs both of us to be here for her. She's gonna be starting school soon. You're gonna be gone. Did you talk to her about Denver? I tried to.What'd she say? Says she doesn't wanna talk about it. Didn't wanna talk about anything. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CALVIN: You know you're losing your rep. Don't you mean my grip? At lest you're not losing your sense of humor. I wasn't kidding. I mean, look at me. I... I can't stay awake in class. I start crying for no reason. All 'cause of that thing at camp? Not just that. And my mom wants us to move to Denver. Denver? What for? Doesn't matter. You know, I just feel like my whole life is jinxed. But I don't care. It's the weirdest feeling. I just don't care about anything anymore. [MARCUS LAUGHS] Uh-oh. You could've moved that one. Nah! It's too late now. You let go of it. You have homework tonight? A little. You mind if I check it? What for? Well, just like to make sure you understand... I understand fine. You don't have to check everything I do just because... [DOOR OPENS] Hi.LEAH: Hi. Let me get that for you, hon. Thanks, sweetie.Hi. Hi.Mmm. Well, something smells good. I've been living on airplane food for two days. Hi, darling. So, you had dinner? Oh, yeah, I'm exhausted. How've you been, sweetie? Hmm? Ooh! You saved me something though. Yeah. Wait a minute. LEAH: Oh! What's this? We already talked about that. Never had an F before. MARCUS: Honey, that's finished. We talked about it. So, what'd you talk about? It's over. You weren't here, we took care of it. Doesn't mean I don't have a right... You weren't here, you can't expect to just come... [SCREAMS] Stop it. Why can't you just... [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Just why can't you... Why? [BANGS] [SOBS] She felt just terrible about the grade, so we talked about it. She was just starting to get back into a decent mood. I didn't wanna [SIGHS] just rehash the whole thing in front of her. Why didn't you tell me that? Well, I was trying to. MARCUS: There's just no good solution. You want the job in Denver. [SIGHS DEEPLY] Robin and I wanna stay here. I'd at least like to try it. Yeah. Well... [SIGHS] Maybe we should talk about a compromise. What if you take the job in Denver... and you come home on the weekend. Just see how it goes. MARCUS: She's not moving for good. She's just gettin' an apartment, she'll come home on weekends. Or maybe we'll go visit her. Who knows? We might go there, fall in love with the place. But, you know, if, if, if we don't then, um... Then I'll come back. So nothing's gonna change that much for us, Robin. MARCUS: Certainly not right away. I just want you to know that we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think it were for the best. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] BOY: I'll race ya. Whoa! Whoa! MAN: Where are you goin' I'm gonna...[CHILD GIGGLING] I'm gonna get you.[LAUGHING] [CLAPPING AND CHEERING] [LOUD WHISTLE][CHEERING] BOY 2: Win this one, all right... Robin! What's up? My mom's moving to Denver. So what's gonna happen to you? Me and my dad'll stay here. When's your mom leaving? Next week. Right after she gets back from Baltimore. MAN 2: Calvin, let's go! Look, I gotta go. You wanna do something later? How much later? Like 30 minutes? Well, I'll meet you here. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Do you mind if I sit here? I hate to throw a stale bread away. [PIGEONS COOING] Do I know you? I don't think so. My name's Dorothy. And yours? Robin. Robin. Little red bird. You know I was sitting over there and I couldn't help but notice that that boy upset you. Was he being mean to you? Oh, no, Calvin, no, he's my friend. Boys can be so mean sometimes. No, we were just talking. [FLUTTERING] Shoo! Shoo! I hate it when they fight like that. [CHIRPING] You seem so bothered. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. You know, but crying is nothing to be ashamed of. It's one of the gifts God gave. To help us heal. And whatever's troubling you, it'll get better much faster if you let yourself cry. I... I don't think so. Would it help to talk about it? My mom... Um... ...is moving to Denver. And she wants me and my dad to go with her. Aw... And you don't wanna go. I bet she told you it's all for the best, didn't she? I know how that feels. I was always being told things that weren't true. You know, to make me feel better. Right, so, it's getting late. Better go. [RUSTLING] Would you mind feeding them the rest? You'll feel better for it. It was nice meeting you, Robin. Oh, and next time, you ask if you know me, I'll say, "Yes." [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SQUAWKING] [GIGGLING AND LAUGHING] Feel guilty not taking you to the airport. Oh, no, I'd rather you took Robin trick-or-treating. As long as I get the candy corn, please. Okay.Okay. So, I'll call you and say goodnight. Bye.Bye. When you wake up Saturday morning, I'll be here. We're gonna have the whole weekend together. Maybe we'll wait up for you.That'd be nice. Okay, goodnight, babes. Night.I miss you already. LEAH: Robin, I love you. Say hi to Denver for us. Bye, sweetheart.Bye, Mom. CHILD: Trick or treat!Come on, honey. Let's get that Halloween costume going. Get out there, get that candy corn. [DOOR SHUTS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] MAN 3: Well, we gotta get this unloaded in half hour. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CALVIN: What's the matter? I know that woman. Hey, Robin.Hi! Are you moving here? Yeah. I've been looking for a place in the neighborhood for weeks. And I finally found a nice studio up on the third floor. I live here. In this building? Yeah. One-fourteen. Oh! We would be neighbors. I'm up in 306. Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you too. Do you live in this building too?Yeah, over in building B. Oh! Well then, we'll all be neighbors, huh? I hope you come up and visit me sometime. Yeah, I will.Okay. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] DOROTHY: Yeah, I just moved into the apartment building. MARCUS: All right. It was funny, the other day I was in the park feeding the birds, and... Well, hey!Hi, Robin. Hi.MARCUS: You know each other? Well, yeah, that's what I was about to say. The other day I was in the park, and I met Robin. Oh!How are you? I'm fine. I locked myself out of the apartment. I didn't know anybody else in the building. And the manager's not home. Oh! Come on in. I'll page him. Thank you. Well, I have to go finish my homework. It was nice to see you again. Yeah, you too. Well, he should call right back. Want me to get you some coffee, some tea, or... Oh, no, thank you, I'm fine. [PHONE RINGS]Oh, there he is. Hello!

He's on his way over. Robin looks a lot like her mother, doesn't she? Yeah, she sure lucked out. Well, tell me about yourself. You're from around here... Oh, yeah, I've lived in the area all my life. Uh-huh. [LAUGHS] That one's cute. Where was that taken? Florida, we were down there five years ago. [DOORBELL RINGS]Oh, there he is. Hey, Linus, thanks for coming. No trouble. Hi, Dorothy.Hi, Linus. Let's go break down your door. Okay.[ALL LAUGH] Thanks so much for your help.Oh! No problem.It's nice to meet you. Good to meet you too. Say goodnight to Robin for me.I will do that. So long. Robin, hi. I was just coming to give you these. Me? Well, you and your dad for helping me out the other night. All he did was make a phone call. Oh, well, it was very sweet. Here.[ROBIN LAUGHS] Do you play in the basketball team? Um, yeah, at the community center. Oh! You know I used to play. I was first string guard. I really loved it. How was school? It was okay, but, um... I have a ton of homework to do. Oh! Well, maybe we could shoot some hoops sometime. Would you like that?Yeah. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BARKING] Hello!Hi, Dad. Hey, sweetie pie, how was your day? It was fine. Dorothy? Hi, Marcus, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thank you. Robin and I ran into each other at the park today, and started talking about homework. So... She's helping me with my Math. Ah, where did these come from? Oh, that was just a little thank you for helping me the other night when I locked myself out. Oh, pfft, you didn't need to do that. So, homework on a Friday night. I'm impressed. She makes it so easy. Oh, well, you're a very quick learner. And just remember now the area equals... Half the base times the height. DOROTHY: Very good, very good. See, that wasn't too hard, was it? Now I really should be going. No, no, actually you should stay. We've got plenty to eat here. Oh, that's very sweet of you, but I need to be going. You said you didn't have any plans. Come on. No MSG, no red meat. What do you got to lose, huh? Well, are you a vegetarian? No, actually, I'm an architect. Oh! Started out in construction, really wanted to design. So went back to school, started all over. Honey, go set the table for three, huh.Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA SYSTEM] Thanks very much. Little eyeballs here...Ew, ew... Oh, see, now that's what happens. Now you're gonna have to eat it, though. Hey, hon.Hi! Didn't think you were coming home till 11:00. Oh, I got an early flight. Hi.Hi. Honey, this is Dorothy Cotton. She just moved into the building. Dorothy, this is my wife, Leah. Oh, hi.Hi. Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you. I came home early so I could take you to dance class. Cool. MARCUS: Did you eat?Oh, honey, I've eaten all day. I couldn't eat anything. You go ahead. Yeah? All right. So where did you move here from? Not far. Uh, just outside town. I wanted to be in the city. It's just you? Yeah, it's just me. So she just came up and started talking to you in the park. Pretty much. She thought Calvin was bothering me. When was it? Same day you said you were gonna move to Denver. When did she move into the building? Um, like around... I can't remember. You know I have to go back to Denver after your game tomorrow. ROBIN: Tomorrow? LEAH: My apartment's a mess. Looks like your room. I haven't even unpacked yet, but, you know, I will call you at 7:00 so we'll have plenty of time to talk before you go to bed. [BEEPING] [PHONE RINGS][FOOTSTEPS] Hello. Hello. I-Is Robin there? Yes, just a minute. MAN: Yeah, the plans are... [PHONE RINGING] Good morning, Pete. Hey, Marcus. How you doin'? Hey.[PHONE RINGS] Marcus Garr.LEAH: Hi. Hey, you. What are you doing? I called home last night and Dorothy answered the phone. Yeah. I was running late. I asked if she could take Robin to basketball practice. Robin said she comes over practically every day. Well, she helps her with her homework, I don't know about every day. How much do we know about her? Not a whole lot, I guess. Um... I know her husband died a few years ago. Thanks. I think we should find out more. What are you worried about? [SIGHS] I don't know. There's just something about her. Well, hon, I don't think there's anything to worry about. I mean, I will talk to Robin. But my impression is they're just pretty good friends. [DOROTHY HUMMING] DOROTHY: Now just beat that a little bit more. And then you can stir in half the bag of chips. How many is this gonna make? This batch is gonna make about two dozen. And I like to make them very small. So I can eat lots of cookies but not lots of fat. [LAUGHING] I wanna save some for my mom. She loves chocolate chip cookies. Well, why didn't she ever bake them? Well, she does. I mean the frozen kind they scoop out of a tub. Yeah, that's not really baking. That's just turning on the oven. [SCREAMS] What are you doing! I told you to put in half the bag of chips. ROBIN: What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? But why? We'll start it over. Well, we could've used that. We could've just added more of all... Yeah, but that's not the point. The point s that I told you to do something a certain way and you didn't do it. So now we're going to start over, and this time, I want you to do it right. All right. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I scared you? Okay.Okay. [CLANGING] [CREAKING] [DOOR SHUTS] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Calvin, give me the ball back. Come on, I'm gonna get it. [CAMERA CLICKS] ROBIN: Look who's got the ball now. [CAMERA CLICKS] Come on. Come on. Give me the ball.Yah! DOROTHY: Now you don't have to keep any secrets from me. Not like you might from your parents. I don't keep secrets from them. If you had a boyfriend would you tell me? I don't. You know, sometimes... well, boys can act like your friends. But you... you never really know what's on their minds, even at your age. Do you know what I'm talking about? I guess. Well... I'd say this looks a lot nicer, wouldn't you? And I like your bed over by the window. So much better. Why don't you go stand next to it? What for? So I can take your picture. You took my picture yesterday, and the day before. Smile for me. Come on, you can do better than that. [CAMERA CLICKS] LEAH: When did she take these? ROBIN: She's always taking pictures of me. I think some of them are pretty good. Is she a photographer? No, I think she just likes taking pictures of me. I don't mind it that much. Except that she makes me smile. You can't make someone smile. She tickles me. Tickles you how? Like when she takes me to my dance class. She takes you to your dance class? Yeah, sometimes when dad works late, she takes me to my dance class. Really? That's interesting. I want to talk to your dad about this. Ballet...Yeah, I want to do modern dance for a while. DOROTHY: Oh, hi. I was just coming to see you. I made some brownies. Thought you might like some.Thanks. Can I ask where you come from? You mean just now? No, I mean, who are you? What do you do? I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about you. Well, I don't spend all my time with your daughter. I'm not spending all my time with your daughter either. I don't want you taking any more pictures of her, okay. And I don't you tickling her to make her laugh. Mom, please. I'll come back another time, okay? I'm talking to you. Would you please let go? I want to make sure you are hearing me. What are you doing?I hear you quite well. Hey, hey, what's going on? What's going on?Show him. What?The pictures. What pictures? All she did was take a few pictures of me. It's no big deal. I just came down to bring you some brownies. I didn't know I was gonna cause a problem. My plane leaves in a couple of hours. I don't wanna go away. I'm so worried about this. What do you want me to do? Keep Robin away from her. We live in the same building, honey, how am I going to do that? Then at least find out more about her. I can't do it. I'm 800 miles away. Yeah, I think if you were home more, you would see that this is not a problem. Dorothy has been nothing but helpful. [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] You think these are helpful? I think they're creepy. Okay, I'll talk to her. But I think you're overreacting. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hi, Dorothy, this is Marcus Garr. Uh, Leah and I just wanted to call and... just say how sorry we were about the misunderstanding. Oh, that's sweet of you to call, Marcus, but there's no need to apologize. Well, she's... I guess she's just been a little stressed out with all the traveling and the new job and... No, I understand. I mean, she's right about one thing. We really... We really don't know that much about you. Well, let's see. I was born the same month Kennedy was shot and... I got married when I was 21, and Arthur and I never had any children. But we loved to cook. And we bought this bakery and... Well, Arthur passed away a few years ago, and I still own the bakery. But, you know, without him it's just a business. Yeah, uh, you don't have to go into all that. Well, I just don't want you to feel like, uh... I'm hiding anything. No, no, no. We know that. Um... But thank you for being so understanding. Okay. Good night. [SIGHS DEEPLY] [EXHALES DEEPLY] I can understand Mom not liking Dorothy. I thought you were asleep. She's just a friend. I know. How about you? Well, I'm your friend too. I mean, you and Dorothy. Me and...? What kind of question is that? Come on. Let's get you to bed. Okay. ROBIN: Sometimes I wish we didn't have such a weird family. MARCUS: Who said we have a weird family? You're not a normal dad, Mom's not a normal mom. Just because I do the laundry and the cooking that doesn't mean we're not a good family. ROBIN: I didn't say "good", I said "normal." MARCUS: Oh, well, normal doesn't matter so much if you're a good family. ROBIN: Do you think this is s good family? MARCUS: Are you kidding? Of course I do. Honey, look, we're going through a tough time right now. But remember, we love each other. And we're gonna stick together, no matter what, okay? We're not sticking together now. Mom's gone. Mom is trying something. If that doesn't work out, she'll be back. ROBIN: I don't wanna move to Denver. MARCUS: I know you don't, but you haven't seen it yet. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe we'll both like it. ROBIN: What if we don't? MARCUS: Mom will be back. MARCUS: Come on, bed. Sleep, come on. [SIGHS] I love you, sweetheart. ROBIN: I love you too. [MURMURING] I love you, sweetheart. Good night. Hello, anybody home? [CLOCK TICKING] Robin? [POP MUSIC PLAYING] TEACHER: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four... Knee and knee... One, two, three, four... One, two, three, up. One, two, three, up. One, two, three...Oh! TEACHER: Whoa! Oh-oh! You guys okay?Uh-huh. Yeah, all right. Robin, focus. And let's take it from the top. Five, six, seven, eight. One and two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight. [SIRENS WAILING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] DOROTHY: You did a very nice job in there. You seemed a little distracted though. Can't seem to do anything right these days. Is something troubling you? [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Everything. My parents, move to Denver, The accident at camp. What accident was that? [DOOR BANGS SHUT] I met this girl at camp. And she drowned. And it was my fault. How was it your fault? I talked her into going into the water. She couldn't swim very well, but I kept saying, "Come on, you can do it, come on." I tried to save her. But she started pulling me under. So I pushed her away. What was her name? Amelia. Amelia made her own choice. She couldn't make any choice. Her mom was some kind of dictator who never let her think for herself. I'm sure that's not true. Look, I know you're trying to make me feel better, but nobody can understand. Nobody can. But I do understand. Better than you think. Something very similar once happened to me. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE STARTS] Thank you. I had a younger sister. She was four years younger. With the same name. Amelia. And she was my best friend. But she died when she was only three. So you were seven? Mm-hmmm. We were playing up in the attic. I was pretending to be a fairy princess or something. And I'll never forget the moment that I turned around and she wasn't there. The door was closed. And the first thing that I thought of... was that I had made her disappear. But then I thought she was hiding. And I started looking around for her. Calling her. "Amelia, I can't find you." But I always knew where she was. But I couldn't find her anywhere this time. [SOBS] And then... And then I heard a scream. It was my mother's. And it was coming through the window. That's when I realized that the window was open. She fell out the window? Then I ran over and I looked out. And all I could see was my mother's back. But she was almost in tears. And little Amelia's feet were sticking up beside her. Do you think that was my fault? Of course not. Well, I do. Why? For the same reason you think that the drowning was your fault. Would you excuse me for a moment? Excuse me, sir.Hmm. Would you mind taking a picture of me and my daughter? We're sitting right over there. But she doesn't like her picture being taken, so just... Now, have you ever had your palm read. No? ROBIN: I thought if I went to camp, my parents might get along better. DOROTHY: There's nothing you can do about them. Your mother's a very troubled person. What do you mean? She also has a very dark aura. What does that mean? You have to accept it, Robin. Appreciate it, what you have. Right now. Because what you have right now is all you've got. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] MARCUS: Well, your mom's here. Not sure exactly where. How do you know she came home? Her car's gone. She probably came home and went out to get some groceries. [DOOR OPENS] Oh, here she is. Hi.ROBIN: Where have you been? Ah, well I got home early and there was no one here, so... I thought I'd catch you at your dance class, but you'd already left. Aw... Hi.Hi, baby. Mmm.How are you? We're fine.How was your class? It was fine. Huh. Say, uh, wh-when is Thanksgiving break? Wednesday, why? Oh, well, it's... it's a long weekend, I was thinking it might be a good time for you and Dad to come visit Denver. Ooh! Next week? Yeah, it might be fun, huh? LEAH: They call it the mile-high city with lots of lakes, and the mountains are beautiful. They're all covered with snow. Good for skiing, huh? Oh, the slopes are in our way. We can go skiing every weekend. What if we go there and we don't like it? Then I'll come home. What about your job? I like my job. But you and Dad come first. So, what'd you and Dorothy talk about? Nothing. But she's starting to make me kinda nervous. LEAH: Yeah, in what way? ROBIN: In just the way she talks to me. LEAH: Did you tell your dad? ROBIN: No.LEAH: Why not? ROBIN: I was hoping maybe you could. LEAH: It's not the same, honey, he has to hear it from you. ROBIN: Okay. LEAH: Talk to him, honey, he'll listen. I love you, sweetheart. ROBIN: I love you too. I love you, sweetheart. I love you, sweetheart. [THUDDING] I just don't like her anymore. Well, she sure has done a lot for us, especially for you. How come you like her so much? What do you mean?I mean if you and mom weren't married, would you and Dorothy... If your mom and I weren't married, Dorothy and I would be friends, period. You don't have to get all mad at me. I am not mad.You are, too. Sweetheart, I want your mom to come back as much as you do, well, let's not take it out on Dorothy. My mom hates her, but my dad thinks she's Miss Wonderful. What do you think about her? I just want to get away from her. Every time I turn around she's there. I've seen her following you. You have? Taking pictures of you. I bet she's following us right now. Be serious. I am serious. Look, come here. So, I guess I could've been wrong. Wouldn't that be a miracle? [LAUGHS] Come on, I gotta get home. Why do you gotta get home for? Why don't you go to the park or something? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi. Uh, I have to do my chores. I'd be happy to help. Um, yeah, you know I just wanna be alone, I'm tired. Oh, what do you need to be alone for? Well, I like being alone. Well, if you want to be alone, that's fine. First let me show you what I've got. It's a present. What is it?Ooh! Let me come in. I'll show you. I saw you with that boy again. Calvin? Just now. Outside. You were following us? [LAUGHS] Heavens, no! I was looking out the window and I saw you walking home from school. And I thought I'd come down and visit, that's all. What is it? It's Sujolite. And it's not easy to find. But it's the perfect stone for you. What do I do with it? You keep it with you. It has marvelous healing powers. And it also has the power to help you forgive yourself. You know I thought about it, when you told me about that little girl that drowned. Now, let's see what you got for homework tonight. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [CLATTERING] [SIGHS] [ENGINE STARTS] Hey, Frank.Hey, Robin. [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS] [DOORBELL RINGS] DOROTHY: Robin! Open the door. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Robin, I know you're in there. [DOORBELL RINGS] I saw you come in. [DOORBELL RINGS]Robin. Open the door. What's wrong with you, silly?

Uh, could you hold my calls? WOMAN: It's your daughter, Mrs. Garr. Oh, put her through. Hello.Mom. DOROTHY: Robin. Dorothy's right outside and she won't go. Could you excuse me for a minute, please? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Did you call Dad? No, I tried talking to him, but he won't listen. Hold on a second. She's gone. But every time I come into the building, she's right there. I'm gonna call him right now, okay? I'll call you back in a minute. [BEEPING] Marcus Garr.LEAH: Hi, it's me. Oh, hey, what's up? I just got a call from Robin. She's having a real problem with Dorothy. She won't leave her alone. Why didn't she talk to me? Well, she tried.When? I don't know, but I want you to tell Dorothy to leave her alone. Okay, fine, but I've got a problem. I just asked Dorothy to spend the night with her. Spend the night? Yeah, Malcolm needs me to go to LA, there's that city planner coming in from Seattle. He only has time tomorrow morning to talk about the new plans. Does Robin know about this. No, not yet. I don't want her spending the night with Dorothy. I don't have any choice. Call an agency, call one of our friends. Honey, I'm running out of here in about two minutes so I can go home and pack and catch a 6:50 flight. I will be home by noon tomorrow. I'll come myself tonight if I have to. Why? Just so Robin doesn't have to spend the night with Dorothy? Yes! Honey, that is crazy. Thanksgiving is the day after tomorrow. We're gonna come up and see you in Denver. You don't get it, Marcus, she is afraid of Dorothy. Did she say that? She doesn't have to, I can tell. Look. If you're going to LA, I'll take the next flight out. I'll be home by 9:00. Okay, fine, I'll just... I'll have her stay with Robin till you get there. ROBIN: Why can't I just stay with Hanna? I can call her right now. Honey, I've gotta leave in 15 minutes. Yeah, but why can't I just go? Robin, Robin, stop. I know you're fed up with Dorothy. I understand. Your mom's gonna be here by 9:00. You only have to be with... [DOORBELL RINGS] [SIGHS] Honey, you can put up with this for a few hours, okay. Just be nice, everything will be fine. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi, Dorothy, come on in.Hi. How you doin'?Good, good. Listen, there's been a change of plans. Leah is coming after all, so... You won't have to spend the night. You still need me?Yes, yes, yeah. But just till 9:00. She should be home by then. Okay, all right.Great. [POP MUSIC PLAYING][KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] Come in. Hey. Listen, I talked to her. Told her Mom's coming home.Good. So, she gets on your nerves, just, you know, come up here, close the door. This will be your sanctuary, okay? Okay. Just try to be patient with her, alright? You're the only friend she's got. I'll try. [LAUGHS] Okay, I love you.Bye. Love you too. I'll see you tomorrow. Can you route me through another city? I tried that. All the flights going into Phoenix were full. What if I went first class? I'm sorry, there's nothing. Look, I don't care how many planes I have to change, I promised my daughter I'd be home, I have to be there. Hi. Would you knock, please? Of course. What are you doin'? Writing in my diary. Wanna play some cards? Can't write neatly lying on your bed. I'm the only one who has to read it. Well, even so... You know years from now you'll wanna be able to read what you wrote. Otherwise what's the point. I wish you'd sit at your desk over there. I don't wanna sit at my desk. You sound angry. Maybe you're hungry. I'm not hungry. Well, I'll have dinner ready in about half an hour, okay. Your father says you have a little homework. [PHONE RINGING] LEAH: I'm at the airport. There's a problem. This place is mobbed here. I may have to stay in Denver and try and get home for Thanksgiving. I may not make it, but I'm still hopeful, honey. I'm trying to get a connection through Salt Lake, but I have to go on standby and the list is a mile long. Is everything there okay? Yeah, yeah, it's okay. You want me to talk to Dorothy? No, no, that's okay. All right, well, tell her what's going on, I'll, uh... I'll keep my cell phone on. And if you need me, just call me immediately. I love you, sweetie. I love you too. Okay, honey, bye-bye. Bye. [BEEPS] You should re-write this English paper. What for? Your indents are way too big. They should be four letters wide. I'm not going to re-write it for that. Well, you are if I say you are. The margins don't matter. [CLICKS TONGUE] Well, neatness matters. And this is very sloppy work. And I want you to fix it. [KNOCKING] Why bother knocking if you're just gonna open the door? To let you know that I'm gonna open it, isn't that what you wanted? [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Your paper looks fine now. [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] Have you brushed your teeth? No, I'm still hungry. Well, you can't eat this late. It's almost bed time. Excuse me, I'm getting a snack. No, you're not. You're gonna brush your teeth and go to bed. ROBIN: It's only 8:30. You should be asleep by now. There's no school tomorrow.Doesn't matter. I'm hungry. I'm getting something to eat. I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna sit down right now, and write a 100 times, "I will not get angry." What?Right now, sit down. No.What are you doing? I'm calling my mother.Gimme the phone. [GRUNTS] Get in here. [THUD] [SIGHS] Look what you've done. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Thanks a lot.Thank you. Hello! Anybody home? I got a present for somebody. Robin? [ALARM CHIMES] Hmm. [BEEPING] [WOMAN ON PA TALKING] [PHONE RINGING] All passengers reporting to Flight 303 to Chicago... Hello.MARCUS: It's me. Where are you? Hi, I'm at the airport. I just got in. I couldn't get a flight out last night. Didn't Robin tell you? Mm-mmm. Robin's not here. Well, she's not at Dorothy's. I just called there. They must've gone out somewhere. She wouldn't go out anywhere with Dorothy. They might've gone out to the park. Didn't leave a note? No, no note. Just a... sink full of dirty dishes. Dorothy left a sink full of dirty dishes? I don't think so. What do you mean? Well, Robin said she's a neatness fanatic. She alphabetizes her cassettes for God's sake. Honey, come on, everybody has their off day. Marcus? Did I lose you? There's somethin' on the door frame. What? I don't know. Looks like blood. Blood? It's tiny.How tiny? Honey, it's just a smudge. I'm calling the police. Leah, I don't even know that it is... Leah? My husband left her with a sitter, and now they're both missing. Yeah, okay, 2265, Commonwealth Avenue. Yeah, Sandcreek Manor. Yeah, Building K. Apartment 114.

You're the one who called?Yeah. Has she called?No, no. But that doesn't mean anything. Where is that blood?Just right there. The doorjamb there. That little spot. Okay, well, I called all the hospitals and she's not there. Honey, honey, if something bad had happened, Dorothy would've left a note, left a message on the machine. So, what do we do? Taking the information and I'll send it over the teletype as a possible abduction. But chances are they'll turn up on their own. Okay. Right, thanks for coming. Appreciate it. If you hear anything give me a call and I'll do the same. Meantime you might make a "missing child" poster. Put it up around the neighborhood, okay? MARCUS: Okay, thanks. LARKIN: We'll be in touch. [BEEPING] Linus, Hi, it-it's Leah Garr, uh... Can you do me a big favor? MARCUS: Dorothy?[KNOCKING AT DOOR] I'm not supposed to do this, you know. Really appreciate it.Thanks, Linus. Wait here. I'm, uh... just gonna check the thermostat. Hello? Anybody home? Looks like she left in a real hurry. Either that or she never really moved in. Did she have any children? Uh, no, no. What's she doing with this? I have no idea. What do you know about her, Linus? Does she work? Got a bakery somewhere. Right, right, she told me that. LEAH: Where is it?She never said. It's probably on the lease agreement. LEAH: Who's this? I don't know. Maybe a niece or something. Are you calling the police?Yeah. Don't tell them I let you in here. I could get in serious trouble. Wait.What? Oh... Oh...Leah, what? What, what, what? Honey, what are you doing, what are you doing? What are you looking for? Her album. Where is her album? What's that? It's a baby monitor. This looks just like that at Dorothy's. She must've been listening in. My God! She was listening in. Oh, I can't believe this. Oh, oh, oh![CLATTERING] Honey, what is it? Just... [PANTS] It's Robin's friend from camp. The one who drowned. Well, now that can't be right. No, that's the same social security number as the woman I'm looking for. No, it-it's a different Dorothy Cotton. Well, that means that she rented a condo using your name, your social security number, your bank account... What? MARCUS: When did... When did this... All right, yeah, I've gotta go. Uh, she's not Dorothy Cotton. What do you mean?I talked to Dorothy Cotton. She had her purse stolen this summer just before we met this... She stole someone's purse?Whoever she is! Yeah...And now we have no idea who she is! Linus, what do we have? Do we have a-a license number for her car? No... I've got these.[LEAH SOBS] LINUS: She drove a Dodge Dart. Brown.Dart... Dart... We'll talk to Detective... What was his... What was his name? [SCREAMS] What was his name? Recording at the camp says they're closed for the winter and they don't give a referral number. This woman have any friends, a husband, an ex, a boyfriend? Not that we know of. She said her husband had died. We-we don't even know her name. Or why she would be doing this. Or-or is this some kind of twisted revenge. Honey.Revenge for... Well, what-what happened to her daughter. You don't even know if this is her daughter. No. [SOBS] Honey. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS] [CREAKING] Are you feeling better? Where am I? You're home. What are you talking about? And where did you get all these pictures of... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Why don't you go back to sleep, sweetheart? [WHIMPERS] You need your rest. You'll feel much better in the morning after you've had a good night's sleep. And I'll make you a nice hot breakfast in the morning, okay? There you go. All tucked in. [SOBS] [DOOR CREAKS AND SHUTS] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [CHIRPING] If you see this little girl, please call that number right away. Thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] If you see this little girl, please call that number right away. CALVIN: Mrs. Garr. MARCUS: Calvin, have you seen Robin? No, what's the matter? [SIGHS] She was with this woman who called herself Dorothy. Dorothy! She's that weird lady. What do you mean "weird", Calvin? She was always following us around. Robin hated her. If you knew where they might've gone? No. Robin tell you about the girl who drowned at camp last summer? Yeah, she told me all about it. Well, we think that Dorothy might be that girl's mother. Would you be able to take some of these and put 'em up around the neighborhood? Yeah, no problem. If you hear anything at all, call that number, it will ring on my cell phone. Yeah, you got it. Come on, guys, let's go. We can put these up around the school. We can't do this.What? We can't wait for the police, you know, to find out about the camp, we gotta do this ourselves. [DOOR OPENS] Good morning. I hope you're hungry. Do you remember that time we drove to Santa Fe and stayed at that little bed and breakfast? And they served this wonderful waffles with... Dorothy, why are you doing this to me? No, sweetheart. I'm Gretchen, your mother. You're not my mother. Try saying it. Momma.I wanna go home. Call me momma. The way you used to. I never called you momma. Of course you did, Amelia. Amelia! I am not Amelia. Just try saying it. Momma.Look at me, I'm Robin. Well, perhaps after you've had something to eat, dear. No![LOUD CLATTERING] Now you clean that up, Amelia. I am not Amelia! [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] What is that for? You know perfectly well what it's for. And if you haven't come to your senses, by the time it burns down to here, I'll have to use it. And I hope you won't make me do that, Amelia. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CREAKS SHUT] [BIRD SCREECHING] If I hadn't let her go to camp, this wouldn't have happened. This did not happen because Robin went to camp. It happened because that girl drowned. Robin coaxed her in the water and she drowned. How is that your fault? How is that anybody's fault? You said it yourself. I'm always rescuing her. I never teach her the consequences. You can't blame yourself for that. This happened because of me. I let that woman into our house. I should've listened to you. [BANGING] Marcus, the window. [GRUNTS] [CLAMORING] Oh, my God. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Leah, how are we gonna do this without a last name? We just look for any camper named Amelia. Wait a minute. I've got an Amelia. Yeah.Mother's name is Grace. What's the last name?Phillips. Phillips, Phillips.Phillips. Uh, no, no, keep looking. I should've been here. [SOBS] I should've been here for Robin. And I wasn't. I was just gone. Honey... Oh... Wait, I found it. McIntyre. Amelia McIntyre. McIntyre. Yeah. McIntyre. Got it. McIntyre. Mother's name is Gretchen. Ninety-five, Glenn Hollow Road, Marysville. Marysville. There's a pathway between 96th. [CLICKING] It's dead. Forget it. We'll call from the car, come on. Her name is McIntyre. She lives in Marysville. Ninety-five, Glenn Hollow Road. Okay. Right. He wants us to go home and wait. Where do I turn off? County road six will take us right into Marysville. It's about three miles from here. [DOOR OPENS] [CREAKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] Don't! Save it. Stop it. [SCREAMS][CLAMORING] Get here. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING AND GRUNTING] Get in there. [ROBIN SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Get on the bed, stay there. MARCUS: That must be it. You forced me to do this, Amelia. [WHIMPERS] I'm not Amelia. I'm Robin. [SCREAMS] Get away from me! Stop it! No! No! No!

Don't hurt her. [WHIMPERS] We'll cal the sheriff. Listen to me, Dorothy... Gretchen. Robin didn't hurt your daughter on purpose, it was an accident. Who's Robin? You're holding her. No... This is Amelia and you can't have her. I've lost her too many times. What are you talking about? [WHIMPERING] My first Amelia, my sister, she came back as my child. Then she drowned. [HEAVY BREATHING]And I thought she was gone forever. But she came back and I found you. And I'm not going to lose you. [HEAVY BREATHING] Maybe... Could we just talk to Amelia? What for? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Momma. Momma, please. Just let them talk to me. I... Momma, I promise I won't go anywhere. Just tell them to go away, huh? You tell them to get out of here. [PANTING] Help me! [GASPING] Help me! Help me! Help me in here. Help me! They're trying to take my child. Are you Gretchen McIntyre? Yes. I'm Detective Larkin. Nobody's going to take anybody's child. Everything is gonna be okay. Thank you. Why don't you go outside and wait with your mother? [PANTING] [SIGHING] Let's go. [ROBIN WHIMPERING] Easy. [SCREAMING] Amelia, what are you doing? [GRUNTS] Amelia, no! [SOBBING] Okay. [LAUGHS] All right. You go hide, go hide. [PANTING] Okay. Okay, all right... [PANTING] One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... [BIRD SCREECHING] What are they gonna do to her? Well, she's a very sick woman, so... She'll probably go to jail, then to a hospital. DOROTHY: Amelia, where are you, where'd you go? Ready or not, here I come. You can't hide from me. I always find you. I know all your little hiding places. I'm gonna find you again and again and again and again. 'Cause I know everywhere you hide. I'll always find you. Gee, I wonder where Amelia is. I can't find her anywhere. Amelia! She's asleep. [SIGHS] I wish we could tell her this was all just a bad dream. [BREATHES HEAVILY] You know, I meant what I said back at the camp. I have been so fixated on wanting more for us... More money, uh, a bigger house. And I told myself, it-it was for all of us. I wasn't thinking about the family. I was thinking about me. You knew that all along, didn't you? I knew that if I didn't agree to move to Denver then I might lose you. I wasn't about to let that happen. Uh, I don't need the position in Denver. I could work right here in Phoenix. I don't need more money, I don't need a bigger house, I don't need those things to be happy. I need a home. And as long as I'm with my family, I have that.
