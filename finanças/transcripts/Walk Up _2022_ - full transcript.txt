Walk Up Hello. It's been a long time! Yes, long time no see! That's for sure. How long has it been? It's great to finally see you. - How are you doing? - Everything's fine. - Your daughter? - Yes. Glad to see you. Me too. - Come in. - Thank you, come in. Hi. She used to study fine arts, but apparently she has already given up on that. Really? You studied fine arts before? Yes. Why do you want to switch to an interior designer now? I don't know. Probably because at this job you can meet a lot of people. I think it will help me come out of my shell. Making new acquaintances is good, but exactly what do you like about it? Well, I'm an introvert, so this kind of job, I think, is good for me. Although she is an introvert, she manages to express herself. She is a very reliable person. You cannot know this for sure. This is not true? Am I wrong? Well I do not know. Indeed, this is our first meeting in a long time. Really? Our first meeting in 5 years. - So long time no see? - Yes. Long time no see, right? Is that why you're so embarrassed? Perhaps. Income also has an effect. All this art has nothing to do with earnings. So, only one daughter? Is there no one else? Only her. She says she wants to study to be an interior designer. I would like you to talk to her about this. But we don't insist, really. It's no bother for me. Maybe another time. It's fine. I heard that your film won an award. Oh yes. I saw it on TV, it's a very honorable award. Congratulations, that's amazing. Thank you. I mean it, it's very cool. Oh! Oh, thanks. Jules! What? Bring us a bottle of red wine. What kind of wine do you want? Not too expensive, so it is not so scary to drink. Okay. Did you name him "Jules"? He loves a writer named Jules, so he told me to call him that. - Interesting, good name. - Yes, good. Sounds like a female name, - but it's not a bad name. - Yes. Shall we drink for your achievement? I'm driving, so... - But a little is okay. - Will you drink? I'll drink a little to celebrate. Since you're driving, we'll drink a little. Okay. There is my workshop. - Do you have a workshop? - Yes. But I often go there to relax. - Is that so? - Yes. I have never worked from the office, I am always at the construction site. From the workshop in that room - one name. I want to see the workshop. We'll go there, let's go upstairs first. - You bought the whole building? - Yes. The stairs are really cool. Narrow but neat. I really like places like this. - Songhee isn't there. - Really? She is the owner and chef of this restaurant. There are still visitors, but she herself isn't there. Is this the same restaurant as the one on the ground floor? Yes. Only here they are engaged in management and training of personnel. They can receive special visitors here, something like a restaurant for one table. But here it is unlikely that even one table will fit. Unusual place. - Shall we eat here next time? - I don't mind. It's a deal, then? Of course. It's already busy, let's go upstairs. - Is there nobody there? - They've gone to work. Can we come in? No one feels shy here, so we don't lock the doors. - Really? - Yes. Even at night. Sometimes I bring them their parcels, and that's how I open it and that's it. Pretty unusual. Come in. Wow, what a huge window, just like what I saw abroad. A cute couple lives here. They lived abroad for a long time. - Although it's small, it's cozy. - Yes, it's very good. It's like being in another country. At first I wanted to live here myself, but decided to rent it out. - Really? - Yeah. Do you like it? Doesn't look like an attic at all, but... Very beautiful. - Do you like here? - Yes. It's even better outside. - Even better? - Yes. Would you like to have a look? Wow! You were right, for sure. What a space. If you add this to the space in room, it no longer feels tiny. Yes, but I liked it there too. There is enough space for me. - Really? - Yes. So live here, the tenant will be moving away soon. Really? Yeah. If you need a workshop, then this place is just right for you. No, I don't need a workshop. I prefer to live in smaller houses. - Really? - Yes. The tenant was constantly overdue on rent. And now he said that he is moving next month. - Without paying rent? - Yeah. He is a good man, but he has no money. An artist, but he cannot make money with paintings. - He started doing it too late. - Is that so? Says he's moving to Jeju. If you move here, you can pay only half of the rent. Come on, I don't want personal discounts. I'm serious. I am not kidding. If you want, you can not pay at all. - Why would you give me a discount? - I'm serious. Oh! Really? Thank you. Not scared? The railing here is very low so it's kind of dangerous. Сan I have a cigarette, please? Of course. Here. Thanks, I forgot mine. I will go buy some at the store later. Nice car. The man inside loves this car more than anything. Really? I have never seen this model of the car before. This car is many years old, but it has been perfectly preserved. He bought it when I was around 5 years old. I still remember my first ride in this car. - Really? - Yes. You remember your first ride in this car? Yes, I remember. - That's cool. - Yes. Is your name Jules? Yes. Beautiful name. Thank you. I'm also thankful. So, will you be working with Ms. Kim? No, I just need to ask her something. But, anything is possible! - It depends on her. - You are right. She is a good person, but she can be picky about others. Really? What do you mean? Let's just say you have to be successful to get her attention. She likes successful people. I see. Not only that. She likes those who don't contradict her. She only gets along with them. With those who don't contradict her? Well, like that couple. They do not meddle too much, and they are successful. - You don't like her very much? - No, she's good. But she is very picky. In any case, this is your first meeting. She likes to only deal with those who do not contradict her views. She looks very stern, but she is actually a sensual person. Really? That's why she doesn't like bossy people. She likes people who are easily convinced. Is that so? She seems polite when she talks to others, but only because she hopes that she will be treated the same way. I see. Her husband assured me that she's not scary, and he hopes that people won't be afraid of her. That's just the way she is. You're right. But the way she called you was very strange. That's what I'm talking about, it scares everyone. Now I get it. I'll go inside now. Try to do everything you can. Thank you, but I'm still not sure if I want to. Right, don't stress about it too much. Well, when are you gonna sing? Sing? Yes, sing for us. Okay! Sorry. Just a minute, I need to answer the phone. Okay, go ahead. What does he need now? Hello. No, it's okay. Drink up, you're not driving, aren't you? Thank you. - This tastes good, right? - Yes. - Alright, cheers! - Cheers! He plays the guitar so well, I was surprised. He likes to play the guitar, he always played at home. Really? Whenever he sees a guitar, he will definitely play it. Really? It's really so unexpected. I once wanted to learn to play, I even bought myself a guitar. But if you stop learning to play the guitar halfway, you have to start all over again. - It's very difficult, very. - You're right. You need to have talent for this. Anything can be done with talent. Yes, that's for sure. - Welcome back. - Sorry again. Do you mind if I go? Will you stay here? - What happened? - The head of the film studio called me. He wants to see me now. It's nearby, I'll be back soon. It will take half an hour, maybe an hour or less. You will be able to talk. So where do you need to go? It's just right there. It's nearby, so I said I'm on my way. I won't be long. Okay then. Should I stay? Yes, you can ask her questions. Discuss everything. - All right. - I'll be quick. - Go ahead, and we'll talk. - All right. Well I'm off. Thank you. Shall we have some more wine? Okay. The wine is very tasty. Exactly. We'll drink until we run out. You're not driving, are you? Yes. What about clinking glasses? - Cheers! - Cheers. How long have you been doing this? Well, not too long ago, but for a while now. I just liked taking care of my house. Then others seemed to like it, too. One day a photograph of my house was featured in a magazine. Really? The magazine even paid me for it. The editors hoped that I would continue to allow them to take photos. Well, that's how it all went - it went by itself. I did it all alone. Truth is, there is nothing to learn here. You just need to have taste. I see. Your dad is a famous director. How does it feel to have such a father? There is really nothing good about it. You don't like it? Maybe for some he is a celebrity, but personally I don’t think so. Others do not understand this. - Is that so? - Yes, absolutely. Something like that. He used to be a caring family man, even too much, like a hen with eggs. You may not believe me, but he really is a coward. He constantly checked to see if the doors were closed. I would just close the door and he'd check if it is closed. It was difficult for my mother. He is like a child himself. But, having started making films, he began to get acquainted with different women. Then he began to be away from home for a long time. People are in awe of my father because of his image as a director. But in fact, he is prudent and as cunning as a fox. He knows it well and thinks through what he does. I see. How long have they been divorced? Around 10 years. Ultimately, no one knows what kind of person he really is. But doesn't he have another life, outside the family? - Perhaps. - Exactly. He performs not only his role as head of the family. You think so? Outside the family, he reveals his other side. We all have it. In public, we behave in one way, but at home, in a completely different way. Perhaps, outside the home, he is more like himself. I think I get what you're saying. You want to believe that his "home version" is him. Yeah. Why hasn't he returned yet? There are probably reasons. Let's just pretend he didn't really go there. Then we should declare him a missing person. How long has he been gone? He's definitely a missing person. Missing person? Interesting. - Ms. Kim... - Missing person... - Ms. Kim. - Yes? I'm not saying this because I'm drunk, but if you can teach me for, say, 3 years, I'm ready to do anything. 3 years. Or 5, I will do my very best. If I succeed, then I can handle it myself. But I will never forget that you taught me everything. I would tell every client that I am your student. Until the day I die, I will remember what I owe you. I'm getting ahead of myself, but I will try, it's true. I will never disappoint you. I will try, very, very hard! And I won't argue with you. Ah. I understand. We're almost out of wine. I will go ahead and buy some more wine. Are you going to the store? Yes. There is a shop down the street. They have wine there. Okay. Do you need anything else? No, but if you want, you can buy some snacks. Okay. - Do you have money? - Yes. What brings you here? Just visiting, how are you? I'm fine. - I'm not complaining. - Is that so? Long time no see. Not too long, come on. Can I? Did you come by foot? Yes. Of course, I prefer the subway, but it's also good to walk. - You've turned a little gray. - Really? - The purlin here is beautiful. - Do you think so? I already called her, and she, fortunately, is free. - Great. - Of course, we are very lucky. So you still work downstairs? Of course. More precisely, I do not work, but I rest. Oh, right. Wait a bit. We'll eat upstairs, and then we'll go downstairs and have a drink there. - Can we? - Yes, no one has been there for a long time. Oh, that's good then. Not a single person. - It's you? Come in. - Free today? He suddenly came up, I offered him to eat here. Welcome. Today's order has been cancelled, so you can settle down. You sure?! Mr. Director, I'm a fan. I am very glad to see you. Really? Of course, he is my favorite director, I'm a big fan. Thanks, very nice to meet you. - I'm so glad, have a seat. - Thank you. Is it red wine? This is my gift to you. - Really? - Thank you. I am very glad to meet you. I wanted to give you something. At least have this wine. This is the first time I've seen such generosity from her. Probably very expensive, right? You will love this wine. Thank you! I didn't know that you're a big fan of him. You never cease to amaze me! Which of his films do you like the most? - I've seen them all. - Really? Yes, every one of them. Some more than once. So which one did you like the most? I like them all. I'm really a fan of you, this is not just lip service. What do you like about his films? - Shall we have a drink? - Yes. - I'll bring a glass. - A glass? But you don't drink at work. I'm not at work today, it's my day off. Have a good rest then. I'm sorry, Could you... - Oh, of course. - Pour me a drink? Thank you. So... ...what do I like about his films? When I watch his films at home, I laugh out loud. I'm almost rolling on the floor laughing. - Is it okay to say that? - No, no. Everything is fine. So you have an opinion about his films. Well, I don't know what others think. But to me they seem very fun and interesting. At home, I watch them while drinking wine. I turn on the movie, drink a little, and keep watching. They seem to be very suitable for this kind of viewing. Here is one way to watch your films. When I watch them, I take them very seriously. Why so? Do you drink while watching movies? - So I don't feel lonely. - Uh-huh. There are a lot of conversations in your films, but they never bothered me. I watch, then I drink. Something like this. Thank you. - Let's clink glasses. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Wherever you go, you always seem to find some company, huh? Me? - You're the kind of person who attracts people. - Oh dear! When a person sees you, they immediately feel inclined towards you. - You think so? - That's right. You should show yourself more in public. You are very unusual. Uh, thank you. - Cheers! - Cheers! How long have you been doing this? I started not long ago. I used to draw. You draw? Really? My daughter draws too. Now I'm done with it. I started making money at the restaurant. Everyone likes it here. You're a good cook. Everything is delicious. - Thank you. - It's true. I've been doing art for a long time. I graduated from a local high school. But my work isn't the kind that gets attention. Besides, I never wanted to please all those rich ladies with no taste. - So it didn't work out. - I see. At least I tried. Even though I had little chance of success. And I'm far from all that. I just liked to create something. - I knew I won't last long. - You're right. That's when it all started to piss me off. Then I realized that it was time to stop. And now you don't draw? I'm not very good at it. Comparing myself with others, I realized that I have no talent at all. I'm don't have talent, what can I do? - So I want to focus doing this. - That's right, you're doing great. I saw one foreign documentary where they talked about one artist. He got up at dawn. He made coffee, he lit a cigarette - it's still dark outside. And then he started work. I admire him. He worked hard all morning, then went to have lunch at a local eatery. It was like it was written on his face: "Every day should be spent usefully." You need to fill it with meaningful work that will bring satisfaction. And so he lived like that, every day. I think it's admirable. Some lucky people live this way. - That's right. - I was also like that. Maybe he did it because he lived abroad. And he was already old. Really? But making films is very expensive. Even from the very beginning, the money is spent on nonsense. Sometimes you can go completely broke. Movies cost a fortune. - Making movies is really expensive. - Yes. But that's not always the case. You can always get investors. A director like you is not in danger. But there are all these constant demands of investors that need to be passed. You will not believe. One of those elite high school graduates shows up. "Do this, it's the only way to make it sell." "Remove this, add this." "Otherwise, you won't get investment." And after a while, you yourself are removed from the project. Otherwise, they wouldn't see the money. Everything revolves around money. For them, the film is just a way to make money. If you offer them something really worthwhile, they will only turn up their noses. For them, a masterpiece is worthless. They measure everything with money. That's the way it is, but you still make a lot of good films. I agree, don't give up. I don't think so. To be honest, my investor decided to abandon my project. A couple of weeks of filming, a whole year of prep, and it's all for nothing. - He decided just a couple of days ago. - Really? Just like that? Really? The head of the studio told me so. "Sorry, but we don't have any money." End of discussion. Okay, let's have a drink. Okay. - I'm sure you can find another investor. - We'll see. Initially, we planned to shoot abroad. We even found a location and crew. But it didn't work out, and we have been shooting for 3 weeks. - So you've already started to shoot? - Yes. It's been too expensive. - Very expensive. - Let's have another drink. We need to drink more. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you. Delicious. I was planning on taking the subway, but then I thought of you. That you're here. I came out of the subway and decided to visit you. I'm very pleased. - Thank you. - Uh-huh. I left my daughter with you, and I didn't know how to thank you. So I thought I'd have a drink with you. I'm glad you thought so. You kept your word. Oh yes, exactly. To tell you the truth, I feel sorry for Jeong-su. I don't know, she really wants to do it, so I'll do my best to teach her. But the day will come when she will want to quit everything. She never did anything for more than a month. I know. This is my fault. What's up with her lately? Well, we didn't talk for a long time. Of course, I called her every day, but she was always busy with something. And you haven't been home all this time? It would just complicate things. After the first move, I could visit them once every two months. But when I returned, I wondered: What am I doing here? So every time I quickly went somewhere else. Over time, I began to visit them less and less. Now you can’t even say that they are especially happy with me. They don't like me. I think my daughter doesn't either. I see. Her mother told me that she was in Jeju. She is there helping a friend with the opening of a hotel. Still, someday your daughter will look at me with a serious face and say: - "I've had enough!" - Do you think so? Maybe I think so because we drank a lot together? - But it's possible. - No, I don't think it will. So, did you divorce her? Yes, a long time ago. I'm also divorced. It's been three years now. Really? So I'm the only one here who has someone. I think you and him suit each other. Every time I see him, he behaves like a gentleman, he is very friendly to others. He is wonderful. But we both put our work first. We come home and start discussing work. He tells me something, I tell him something. And that is all. Even so? I didn't know. It seemed to me that he was so courteous at home with you. Right now we don't have anything to do together. You have to come up with something, then. I'm so tired. It's only noon, and we're already drunk. - How about another bottle? - Oh, no. Ms. Kim went to get some whiskey. That will be enough. I am very grateful that she introduced us to each other. I am also very glad to meet you. I probably learned about you from your films. Is that so. Then I'm glad I made those films. Mr. Director, please continue. Shoot as much as you can. Make lots and lots of movies! Thank you. I am very grateful. Are you afraid? Am I afraid? Well I mean... Forget it, it just slipped out. I am constantly afraid of my thoughts. Thoughts? Subconscious thoughts. I always have something like this. Each one makes me shudder. For example, I am in a hurry but I am worried about forgetting something. That always stresses me out. I'm trying to think of something, and then all sorts of nonsense appear in my head. Slowly but surely. I see. Sometimes at such moments, it seems to me that my thoughts stumbled upon something, something that led it to itself. Because of this, even some kind of joy appears. But there is always fear in the end. Because of this, I believe in God. I am also afraid of many things. - Really? - Yes. And you look like a person who is not afraid of anything. Well, judging by your films. Do you think? I'm really afraid of a lot of things. Ah. So do you go to shrines? Yes, since childhood. But not too often. But I really do believe in God. It always seemed to me that people invent different beliefs for themselves. I agree. Because they need God. It is only because of this need that religions appear. We are all scared, so we need a God. - Your films are well-made. - What? Mr. Director, your films are really well-made. Really? What do you like about them? I always enjoy watching them. I never liked all those fantastic films. Your films are not that serious, but they are not childish either. They always manage to get through to me. I appreciate it, and they make me laugh. As far as I'm concerned, they are the best. That is a very generous compliment. I am very grateful. Really. And thank you, too. Why are you crying? It's just... My tears just... We drank too much, didn't we? No, it's ok. Let's drink some more. If you want, Kim will bring whiskey, there's also a lot of wine. We have already drunk 4 bottles. Don't worry about paying, it's all my treat. What are you talking about? I've eaten so much here, I'll pay for it all. This will all be very expensive. - So today is my treat. - Is this really expensive? Will I have enough money? Really, don't worry about money. Really? Mr. Director's beloved guitar~ Me? Your daughter told me. - She said you could play the guitar all day long. - Really? Can you play for us? Jeong-su told you that? - Yes, when we talked to her down there. - Did you? - You weren't there? - Hmm. I don't remember anymore. In short, now I know everything about you. Everything? So will you play for us? Of course. - Finish your smoke and come back inside. - Alright. Hooray! He will play for us! Did you buy everything? There was no Romaine lettuce. - Really? - All sold out. It's ok, regular lettuce would do. I'll carry. - They taste the same anyway. - Alright. - Welcome back. - Yeah. You've been out for a long time. - I went to several places. - Yes? I'm tired. They had a rolling pin but it was too big. I then went to another store. You shouldn't have went through a lot of trouble. I bought canned tuna. - Canned tuna? - All-new product. What for? They're in olive oil, so you can eat them. Tuna in olive oil? It's a new product. I haven't heard of them. Great find. - It's nice, right? - Wait a minute. "No canola oil." Only olive oil. - Wow! - Isn't it a miracle? Indeed. Oh, I'll take care of it. Thank you. Delicious? Yes, very tasty. Your salads are very tasty. I'm glad you like eating vegetables. I like to eat like this. Good for the health, plus it's very tasty. That's right, keep that up. But sometimes I really crave my favorite dishes. I don't mind, we already talked about it. I eat like this for my health, you can eat whatever you want. But it's good for you too, right? - Your itchy eyes are gone, right? - Yes. But I can't eat like this forever. I know, calm down. Eat what you want. I lost my appetite. Lost your appetite? The restaurant haven't had a customer in 10 days. I still owe rent. I need to pay as soon as possible. - Will she raise the rent? - Probably. There's no reason for her not to. She's raised the rent before. I checked a place for rent today, it was pretty ok. Really? Where? Nearby, just down the road. - Remember that crossroads? - Yeah. The one in front of it. It's a very nice place. Really? But if we move, there will have to be a major overhaul. I see. If the rent here stays the same, we won't move anywhere, right? In the end, we spent a lot of effort to make repairs here... There are no visitors at all, why would she increase the rent? She's so unreasonable. Don't you think so? Yes, you are right. Let's finish our meal and then we'll talk. It's just affecting our appetite. Just eat. Shall we have another drink? Enough already, you still have to work. No one's coming. Okay, drink this. Have you decided on that retrospective yet? You need to give them an answer. I refused. It will be better that way. It's too much hassle. Have you spoken to them? I sent them a letter. With a long apology, etc. I explained everything to them. It's a foreign festival. They were hoping you would agree. We'd better accept. Maybe, but now with trips abroad everything is difficult. Very expensive tickets, mandatory vaccinations, quarantine on return. Tickets are at their expense on a charter flight. They won't pay for your ticket, only mine. Really, even if it's your retrospective? Oh, they seem to have a very small budget. It's just a small film festival, do you still want to go? At a time like this, the very possibility of some kind of festival already pleases everyone. I would like to go on a trip if there is such an opportunity. In addition, I stated that I am finished with the film industry. So my appearance at this retrospective may seem strange, right? It would be great to go somewhere, though. But I said I'm done, and then I show up at this kind of event? It's ridiculous. I'll look like some kind of joke. I meant that we could have a good time there. Never mind, things can still change. That's how it is. Did you enjoy Japan? We went there, to Fukuoka. It was great. I just feel a little stuffy here, that's all. Eat. Okay, let's eat. Do not raise your blood pressure while eating. It harms digestion. I'm sorry. Let's eat. The salad is delicious. You need to serve it to your customers. Simple but so tasty. I'm glad you like it. Eat well. - I'm going. - Okay. Are you going to the restaurant? I have a meeting with someone. With Junhee. We have been planning this meeting for a long time. It's time for me to go. Really? - With Junhee? - We're gonna meet somewhere close by. She will get married soon. You said you weren't seeing her again. Yes, but this is an important event. She is a very good friend. I think I should see her. Why? Shouldn't I go? No, of course you can. It's just that you said earlier that it's better not to see her. That's what you said. Yes, I remember. But this is completely different, she's gonna get married. Really? Okay, do as you want. She has changed a lot, she has become much calmer. She's no longer as irksome as she used to be. I realized it during a phone call. Okay. She just drank a lot back then. What she said about you was just the alcohol talking. She didn't really mean it. She is a good person. I can't help but see her before her wedding. We have already talked about the importance of the right social circle. - We did. - And you agreed with everything. Yes, but now I have a different opinion. She just said something that she shouldn't have. She already apologized for that. Well if that's what you think, then just go. Will her future husband come, too? - Maybe, since they're about to get married. - I see. It's just nearby, we'll just have a cup of coffee and I'll be right back. - Won't you get bored alone? - Don't worry, go. I'll be back right away. - Okay? - Just go already. I have to see old friends once in a while, alright? Go ahead. - Bye. - Bye. Is anyone home? Oh, I'm here. Do you still smoke? Yes, sometimes. This letter was sent to my mailbox. I opened it because I thought it was for me. Thank you. It's nothing special. How is your health? Much better. - You still don't eat meat? - Yes, you should also try it. Are you sure that's the cause? I do not know, the doctors themselves do not know the exact cause. I'm just terribly worried about you. Thank you. When can you fix this leak? Oh yes. I'll take care of it. But there's a rather strange guy living upstairs. Do you know him? He's a nice guy, but when I knock on his door, he doesn't even answer. So you can't fix it? This is getting really bothersome. We're worried that the problem will get worse. I understand you. I also want to get this fixed as soon as possible. But I'll have to get a carpenter to rip off all the ceiling tiles. It's already getting weak. I'll go ask someone. It will take a couple of days. I'll come back later. Do you have to call someone else? Yes. I will talk to you about it later. I used to want to live here myself. Yeah. - I'll go then. - Bye. Where are you? You've been away for a long time. You promised you would be back soon. I'm waiting for you here. Are you having fun there? I'm sitting here eating an apple while writing to you. If you're up late, at least call. I love you. You've got to be kidding me. What the heck. You're back? Sorry it's so late. Did you have fun? We discussed wedding stuff with her, and drank some wine. The wedding will be in Gwangju, they decided to rent one of the farms there. She wanted to talk about expenses, so we had a drink. I just haven't seen her for a long time, that's why I was late. - Sorry, did you wait long? - Never mind, was it fun? - It wasn't. - Really? Why? I saw a long-haired dachshund, it was very beautiful! I wanted one myself. Really? Where did you see it, at the coffee shop? Yes. Such a cutie, I petted her and petted her. - Shall we get one? - Sure, I like dogs. But I like the big ones. So large that you can feel their weight. Something like 15 kilograms. It will be difficult to keep a dog like that. Then we'll get a dog when we move to Jeju. And when will that be? You said that in 3 years we will have the money we need. 3 more years, huh. 3 years of modest living for the sake of moving. I'm actually ready now. I don't need a lot of money for this. No, we have to wait. - You think so? - Uh-huh. We don't get along too well with Junhee. Yes, for sure. I really like you, I feel good when I'm with you. You are all I need. I love you. My only love. Really? I love you too, really. Thanks. Thanks for loving me so much. I think you're the one. I trust you. I really enjoy talking to you. Thank you, I love you. Thank you too. I think I'm better off alone. I am a loner. I'm comfortable being alone. Very, very comfortable. Sorry. I love you very much, but... I'm sorry. Byung-soo. Byung-soo. Back already? You were gone for a long time. Someone wanted to rent an apartment. I showed him the apartment. The documents have already been signed. - So fast? - How long have you been waiting? I bought some meat. Your favorite sirloin. You bought meat? I wanted to get the neck, but they didn't have much of it. This steak looks much better. I'll help you with the cooking. Thank you. Just a second. What? What are you doing? Wait a minute. What's wrong with you? You made me wait a long time. - Okay, let me wash my hands. - Okay. I'll put the meat in the fridge first. - There? - Yes. Soju tastes better than wine, right? Of course, I realized a long time ago that I don't like red wine. Meat goes well with soju. At your age, drinking so much is unusual. You still have a lot to live for. You think so? A lot to live for? Of course, ask anyone. At that age, people are just beginning to live. Really? You'll like it. Okay. Are you going to drink? I don't like soju. And drink as much as you want. And don't forget to eat, so you'll get better. - Try it. - Okay. Very delicious. - Delicious meat. - Eat. I will buy you this meat every day. Thank you. - I have prepared gifts for you. - Really? What gifts? - Should I give it to you now? - Yes. One minute. I bought you some cigarettes on my way back. - These are so expensive, 7,000 won. - Really? This is a new brand. The son of the owner of a local shop told me about them. Do you talk to him about cigarettes? We know each other well, I go there often. He's very funny. They appear to be made from tobacco leaves. Tobacco leaves are rolled whole for these cigarettes. 7000 won? Almost 2 times more expensive than regular cigarettes. Try. I'll get by with these and save some for later. And what's that? This? Wild ginseng. I wanted to buy it, since it's good for you. I asked around, and everyone recommended it to me. The cure for all diseases. - Wild ginseng? - Yes. And you bought it for me? Is it expensive? Better not to ask. How much? It's a gift. Do you want to try it? Right now? Yes, it can be mixed with food and alcohol. At any time. - It's a very effective medicine. - Really? After 10 jars of these, you will be cured in no time. Thank you. Eat everything. I'll buy more later. - Thank you very much. - You'll be perfectly fine in no time. At home, I mixed it with honey. - With honey? - Yes. You have to chew it well. Don't swallow it right away. How is it? Delicious? Delicious. Delicious honey. Sweet. Chew it some more. I will smoke. Should I continue chewing? Chew it until it's totally crushed. Even if your jaw already hurts. It's medicine, not just food. It says this has 6 milligrams of nicotine, but it doesn't seem like it. It tastes good. - Yes? - Uh-huh. Keep chewing, just a little more. It doesn't get softer. Open the door, please. I know you're inside. Open up. Why don't you open when someone knocks on your door? I saw you come in. I have something to tell you. - Coming. - Open it. Hi. I'm tired. May I come in? Why didn't you open it? And you changed the lock code. I was outside, I wasn't able to hear you. - I see. - Yes. I saw Jiyoung come in. Does she come every day now? Yes. Why so often? Thinking about moving? No, she's helping me with something. How does she help? I can't tell. It's personal. I see. This letter was in my mailbox. - I thought it was for me, so I opened it. - I see. Well, thank you. Are you okay with the bathroom? Can we come inside, or should we just stay here in the doorway... It's a bit messy there, so it's better here. About the bath... The stench is terrible, nothing helps. After a shower, the water doesn't drain. It stagnates and starts to stink. I'll call a plumber, and let's see what can be done. - Does it bother you much? - Of course. The bathroom should be clean. It stinks so much, who wouldn't be annoyed by that? I see. Thank you. Have you filmed anything new lately? I'm not making films now. I want to get some rest. Maybe a couple of years. - Tell Jiyoung I said hi. - I will. - Here. - What? Her again? Yes. Oh, this woman is killing me! - Was she driving? - It's terrible. How does she manage to constantly collect these fines? That woman is such a pain. Should I call her? One more letter like this and my head will explode. Well, if you call her, what's the point? It's not your car, so why do you get fines? It's all because of the insurance we took out a long time ago. With my job, this insurance was easier to get. They put my name in, so the contributions are less. And if I do not call, what will happen next? It's okay, it's not that much money. Calling will only cause big problems. You'll only stress yourself out. You said it yourself that it is difficult to have a conversation with her. Okay, I won't call. Do you want more meat? I'm fine. I'll eat it tomorrow. - Was that a prayer just now? - Sort of. Tell me again about the moment you started to believe in God. Tell you again? You like it? Yes, it's amazing. I wish that happened to me. But I really do believe in Him. You're the only one I told this to, so let it stay just between us. Of course. I swear. - It happened here. - I see. I was already dozing off, but woke up abruptly. I started to hear a melody. Something like symphonic music. At first I thought it was coming from downstairs. I looked around, and God Himself was in the sky. He spoke to me. "Byung-soo, you need to move to Jeju. After that, you will make 12 films." Oh my! His voice is very special. So resonant and rumbling. "Byung-soo, you need to move to Jeju. After that, you will make 12 films." That is amazing! You have been blessed. You think so? - Don't tell anyone! - I swear I'll keep quiet. He must have come down to you because of your good intentions. It probably is. Since then, everything that scared me so much seems to have disappeared. Really. Now I'm not afraid of anything. I wanted to go to Jeju so I went right away. Oh my love! You're so cute! A person can't be this cute. Thank you. - I feel hot. - Hot? You're not? Let's get out of here? I'll give you an antipyretic. Do you want me to give you a massage? I'll give you a cooling foot massage, you can lie down in the meantime. Massage? The clouds are gathering, it will probably rain. In this weather, a car ride is much more exciting. It's true. What a cool weather. Let's go. I'm craving fried tofu. Yes, yummy. - Wait. - What's up? Who is it? It's from a company. Someone wants to sell a building. I'd better deal with it. Really? Will you wait for me here? I'll deal with the client and come pick you up by car. Okay. - Some people sell entire buildings? - Yes. You'd get bored in the office, and the client needs to be dealt with. So just wait for me here. - Is it okay? - Okay. I'll smoke and come in. Call me when you're done. - Okay, bye! - Bye! Don't worry about it! - It'll be even faster by car. - Huh? Remember the rain. Understood! Wait for me there! Here you are, here are the keys. You didn't have to bring it here. - Oh no, I should bring it here. - Thank you. If a guest isn't feeling well, I should bring their car here. Those are the rules. Yes, I've heard about that. - Mr. Director... - Yes? You have a very cool car. It's a pleasure to drive this car. It's like nothing else, it' so easy to handle. Really? It looks like the car is old, but it has this style and power. - I've invested a lot in this car. - That's right. - Well, I'll go ahead. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. I hope you get better already. Your illness has been going on for a long time. The studio head got sick, so I'll keep him company. - He's sick too? - Yes. He wants to make a movie with me. Really? I don't think anything will come out of it, though. The script is based on a book. It's hard to deal with such films. - The script is based on a book? - Yes, a Chinese novel. It seems to be a bestseller in China. Really? What do you have there? Wine? Will you drink today? I just found a cheap one at the local store. - So it's booze night? - Sort of. Let's go inside together. You've been standing here for a long time. I'll smoke and go home. - You're smoking again? - Well... Is that your second cigarette? Just one more, and I'll go right away. Don't smoke so much. You smoke a lot. You have to smoke in moderation. You must know when enough is enough. Thanks for the heads up. Now it's time for my daughter to lecture me. I'm thankful. - I'll go ahead, come inside immediately. - All right.
