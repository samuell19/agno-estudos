Damn. Anybody around here doing any hiring that you know of? Nope. The young bucks hereabouts gets what work there is. Leak, leak, leak. Fill this up for me, will ya? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Hey, wait a minute, where's my breakfast? Come on, son. You're gonna get outta town right now. It's my right to get some breakfast. We're not feeding ya, I said. You're gettin' outta town, or you're goin' back up there in that jailhouse. That's the way it is, son. You're gonna leave this town right now. Well, it suits me it if suits you. See if you can find three more just like it. And, uh, fetch a box of those crackers. I'll get the coffee and the rest. Oh! How do? We need us a few supplies. Got a list here someplace. Huh. Must've lost it. Let's see, there was coffee, peaches, and a few cans of beans. I'll take these out to the truck while you pay the man. You know, them apples cost me 18 cents apiece? Worth the price. You're just bound to get caught taking something ain't yours, aren't ya? That what you figure? That store man was set to get on you like stink on a skunk. I'm quicker'n what he is. Besides, you didn't have to get mixed in it. I guess I didn't. And I can take care of myself. Says you, with my apple in your hand. So you figure that's twice? I'll let you keep the tally. Gettin' found short of money in that place, sheriff calls being vagrant. Sheriff'll arrest you for being vagrant. He gave me three days of pickin' trash from one end of town to the other. Town feeds a prisoner, but the sheriff wouldn't give me nothing, so I stole this apple. Your four are still in the bag. Where you headin'? I always had a mind to someday see the pacific ocean it's a ways off. I ain't in no hurry. You have no strings? Not a one, mister. Name's mackintosh. I go by t.J. Where're you headed? Oh, next job. Where's that? Wherever. That's about where I was thinkin' to get off, if it suits you. Well, I plan to turn north if I don't tie into something by the time I reach haskell. You can drop me off anytime you have a mind. You're welcome to the ride. I ain't lookin' for nothin' else. What's that? That's the rest of my breakfast. You can add it to your things. The town back there don't owe me anything. I'm just payin' my way. Well, I always have. Man, that sure is a whole lot of nothin' to look at. I look with my eyes. Then for sure, that's all you're gonna see with. You seen a lot, have ya? My share. That's what I figure to do. Have you ever seen the pacific ocean, mackintosh? Fair piece of it once. During the war. What war? The one with Japan. Never heard of it. Would've thought it'd been mentioned in some of your books at school. Book that we was on when I quit was about a feller named dick chasin' a girl named Jane and they had a dog named spot. I always wondered if dick ever caught er. I knew an old boy that was in a war once. In Korea. You know that one? Yeah. He lived with us for a time. Man, he was a squirrelly one. People said it was the war that did it to him. Ma finally threw him out. Boy, she sure could pick 'em. I like not knowing what's around the next corner. Not many corners in this country. That's a fact. There was a time I felt like you do, but I've got to say, it's kinda worn thin. That's what time does. What? Waters down the bite in your vinegar. Did ya ever think to find a place and settle down? Once or twice it crossed my mind when I wasn't lookin'. Why don't ya? Ain't all that much room left, boy. Looks like a helluva lot of room to me. That wasn't exactly my meaning. I know. Like my old man used to say: "Don't want for much, then what you get'll never be a disappointment.‚Äù Something like that. There's somethin' I'm gonna do somethin' about. What's that? Gettin' passed by. We all get to where we're goin'. Some quicker'n others. What happens when the quick ones get there is, they usually have to wait. Damnit all! How much longer is it gonna be? Hard to say. Like a steer, I can try. Not a whole lot gets to you, does it? Not if I can help it. We can sit here the rest of the day! Or you can start walkin'. My pants are all sticky from the peach juice. The next water tank we come to, you can wash 'em out. You could dunk yourself, too. What's that mean? What's what mean? "I could dunk myself, too"? Are you sayin' I stink? You're sayin' I stink! Well, downwind you aren't exactly cinnamon and sugar. Boy, howdy! Now, don't get ringy. Half the day we've been ridin' together, and I just now found out I've been stinkin' ya outta your own junk heap! No, you haven't. The windows were open. I'm gonna start walkin'. Aw, get off the huff. I can't help it if it's hot and the bugs are after you. It's just as hot and buggy for me! Sit over here in the shade, and I'll get it done as fast as I can. - Howdy! - How do? - Trouble? - Some. - Need any help? - Nah, I just about got 'er tied and cut. I could send some help out to ya. No need to. Mister, are we close to anything? Matador's about 60 miles on. - That where you goin'? - Goin' to El Paso. Got room for one? Sure. I don't know how far that place is that you're turnin' north, but if you don't tie into some work... - Haskell. - Yeah, haskell. It's only about a hundred miles or so. But you go ahead. El Paso's a good distance on your way to the pacific ocean. I'd be real obliged for aride. Come ahead! Are you sure you don't want us to send some help back? No need. Well, thanks for the ride.

Nothin'd make me run faster, quicker, farther. Well, I see you've quit stealin' apples for a livin'. Trash pickin', too. I'm makin' 15 bucks washin' a pile of dishes higher'n your hat. Where's my money? - What money? - I left some money layin' right here on this table, and it's gone. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The kid took it. That came by for dishes. Oh, that kid didn't take your money. Hey you, kid. - Young buck, you stole my money. - What're you talkin' about? I'm talkin' about the money you took off that table back there. Yeah, boy. There was a ten, two fives, and some singles. - I didn't take nothin'! - It'll come out of your hide if it don't come outta your pockets. I ain't got it! Wait just a minute. Let the boy explain. You just keep shut, mister. Bite-size? You better turn out them pockets, now. To hell I will! I said I ain't got it! Hold on, cowboy. Stand away, old man. This ain't no concern of yours. T.j., if you don't have the man's money... - I don't! - Then show him! I'll show 'im nothin'! I said I ain't got it. I don't have to prove it! All right. Wait a minute! I didn't take your money! I ain't got it. Honest! Look! Wait! Look! It was under the table! It must be Cal's! I've always felt the man without pride just ain't worth beans. Course, it's been said, there's a time and a place for it. But not for any man I'd want to know. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. How far's the main house? Half mile, straight on. Howdy. What can I do for you? Lookin' for work. Well, Jim Webster's the manager. He does all the hiring when it's needed. Any needed, that you know of? Jim'll be at breakfast. You can catch him at the chuckhouse. I'm much obliged. Let's go, Maggie! I'll get this, ma'am. Well, let's see what's to see. I ain't tyin' into nothin' for no long time. I wouldn't worry about that happenin'. Whoo! Yah-hoo! Yah! Yah! Yah! Get it, get it! Whoo! I'm gonna get you again, too! Morning, Maggie. Luke. Mornin', Jim. Here's them snaps. Looks like it's gonna be a good day. Boys are in good spirits. Yeah... Jim wants to move 60 head or so up on sugar flats tomorrow. Can you have that windmill fixed in time? Doolen, old boy, I'll have enough water flowin' 60 head'll be able to take a bath. But I ain't all that sure about the "or so." They may only get the splashes. - Howdy. - Hi. - I'm lookin' for Mr. Webster. - Why, that won't be hard. Just look for the biggest belly you can find, and he'll be standing right behind it. Thanks. We'll ship those hundred head from the east pen as soon as the trucks get here. Well, you want me to, Jim, I'll go on out there now and wait on 'em. Maggie can catch a ride soon as she gets the supplies. No, there's plenty of time. You can take her back home. Dan and I'll meet you there. That's the one I was tellin' you about. What with Andy Colson bustin' his leg, I didn't know, you might need him. He may be too long in the tooth. Yeah. Well. Maggie. Mornin'. How do? - Mr. Webster? - Jim Webster. Mackintosh. This is t.J. We're lookin' for work. What kind of work do you do? Anything anybody else is too proud to do. Whatever there is to be done. You handle horses? I have all my life. Well, we have a full roster, mackintosh, but there is a couple days' work you could do. It's done. Now, hold on. Some of the boys were gonna take a hand in it, and I had a man coming by to break these horses, but he stove up his leg. Well, I understand. - I mean... - I'll take it. 20 dollars a head, and there's eight of 'em. Find yourself some room in the bunkhouse. Thanks. - Cotton! - Yes, Jim? You and the boys can forget those broncs. I got a man. Make your own time. Might as well get started. Andy! Get 'em over to the breaking corral. It's taken. Let's try this one. Tighter. That's good. Dumb. And broken. Not for long. There it is. You're too old by 20 years. Just make this real tight. So you keep your insides from tearin' loose. What's gonna keep your bones from gettin' busted? Skill. Tighter. Come on. Come on. Hi-yah! Get over! Come on, now. Okay. Come on, you old paint! Get in, get in! Hi-yah!

At sugar flats, gettin' ready for a cows swimmin' party. A what? I dunno, that's what doolen wants. I think he's nutty. Well, one of ya is. And I'm not sure which. Boogie, boogie, boogie! Listen. If you're not too busy Jim would like to have you come over and take a look at the blades on the windmill at the east pens. What's wrong with "em now? He's gonna order some other things this afternoon from the supplier, and if anything need replacing soon, he wants to know. Well, you tell the big daddy of us all that I'll be right over. - Hey, coley? - Yeah? How do you get away with callin' him that? And to his face? Oh, it's just one of those understandings between men, Sonny. Ten-four. That was three awful fine rides. How do ya feel? Well, I've felt better. It was dumb. 60 dollars isn't dumb. And neither is that 100 dollars yet to go. That last one nearly kicked your head off when he throwed ya. He's gonna make a fine mount. Do you want me to leave this water running for ya? What for? Thought I'd just ask. You're sayin' it again, aren't ya? Uh, get my shaving gear for me. - You're sayin' it again! - Sayin' what again? You know what! You're gettin' mighty darn personal, that's all I can say. I guarantee ya, that isn't my purpose. You may be pullin' me along for a free ride, but you ain't my old man. - Hello, there. - Hi, there. You must be the one that saved the fellas from gettin' their tailbones drove up between their ears. Name's coley phipps. Mackintosh. Good to know you, Mr. mackintosh. - T.j. - Real pleasure, boy. You must be a proud "un. Old cotton tells me your pa here done... He ain't my pa. Sorry. Cotton said it was a fair country ride you gave that first bronc. I wish I'd been there to see it. He was a good horse. Yeah, but how'd the rest treat ya? Mmm, nothin's broken. But them, uh, hinges and bolts are some loose, huh? - Some. - Well, I'll tell you what. About 20 minutes, down at the chuckhouse? The cookk'll lay on a table-load of food that'll go a long way to tighten 'em all up real good. I'll see ya down there. Well? What'd I tell ya, Mr. Mackintosh? It was the undyin' truth. I'm packed tighter than a miser's purse. Yeah, cook's tryin' to turn us all into big daddies like this old boy. Whoo-haw! Jim? Do you suppose we could spring for a couple o' bucks to put this lad to work for a day or two? You got a job for him? We was talkin' at supper. That barn could sure use some cleanin' out. You can say that again. Hop to it. Purdy time o' day. Peaceful time, Mr. Webster. Big Tom told me those two other broncs you broke didn't have a Mark on em. That's the way it's done. By a top hand, that's the way it's done. Is that what you've got me down for? Yeah. There was a time. Whereabouts? King ranch. Back in the '50s. Place like that, you had a home. Time came to move on. Evenin', donkin. What happened to your hand? Oh, a coyote I-1 shot the other day. He had a bite left in him, so he gave it to me. Listen, is the supply house open down there? Yeah, well, Dan'll open it for ya. I ain't drawed last month's stores, yet. Yeah, well, I'll send Dan with the key. You go ahead. Oh, uh, listen. Uh, ask 'im to pick me up a couple extra cans of cyanide. I used all I had on a bunch of coyotes I run up to in the flats the other day. Did you clean "em out? No, not yet. Well, we got some cattle grazin' down there. Well, I'll get to 'em before they become a bother. But we got some cows in that bunch ready to calve. Well, I wouldn't... I wouldn't fret too much, boss. Good trapper, is he? Well, if he wasn't, I wouldn't keep him around. See ya tomorrow. Hey! What're you doing back so soon? I was a grandmother long enough. I wanted to be a wife again. Aah. I'll meet you in the house, soon as I talk to Dan. Thank the good lord for the strong west wind. I tell ya, without that, that donkin stink would've hung around here for a week and ten days. I dunno what stinks worse, him or them coyote pelts he collects. But he gets a fair bounty price on them, don't he? Well, it don't make me no nevermind but I'd just soon clean privies for a living as be a trapper. I'll say amen to that, and I'll bet 25 cents. Hey there, boy, don't let them pictures give you no ideas. Nothin' I couldn't have if one 0' them purdies stepped forward and said "howdy." Haw haw haw. Did you hear that? Some of it. You'd think I never saw a nekkid woman before. Dumb. - What is? - Those pictures. Maybe a time comes when a man gets old that that's so, but I've got a long ways to go before then. I'm not talkin' about naked women, boy. I'm talkin' about pictures of naked women. At least, like ones that coley fella's got hangin' on his walls. Well, they ain't dumb to me. Obviously. To me, they make women things. Now, a thing you use and throw away. But a woman you hold and keep. At least a woman amanwants. Well... Yeah, I got a real snorty one to start today with. Yeah, he looks like he ate barbed wire for supper. Could be I'm gonna be his breakfast. You wouldn't mind putting this ride off for a time? Time isn't gonna gentle that ol' boy down. No, but I need big Tom and Ben to move some stock. I got somethin' else for you to do, if you're willing. You're the boss. One of the married hands needs some help with busted fencing, and I can't spare but one man. You could make it two. Shouldn't take more'n a day. We could figure the wages easy enough. You do the figurin', and we'll fix the fence. Cotton's waitin' for ya at the garage. I'll get right over there. It binds some. Hey there, Luke. This here's mackintosh. Jim sent 'im over to give us a hand. Luke Jenkins. Heard you rode a horse or two. And I've been rode by three or four. Ain't that the truth? Gimme a hand with this. - Okay. - Mornin', Maggie! Mornin', cotton. How are ya? Oh, I can't complain. Unless it's for not having one of your meals in a long while. It's not going to be today, I'm-I'm-i"m afraid. Oh, I was bragging on your cookin' all the way down here. I-I'm havin' lunch today, in town with Jenny Fraser. One 0' these days. Yall follow me through that gate there. Hey, Luke! We gonna be able to tear you away from that t.V. Set of yours tonight? Nope! I think I'll just let you young pups have the town to yourselves. You're gettin' in a rut, ol' man. My daddy used to say, "a rut's just a never-ending grave." That's what your daddy said, did he? "Trouble was," he used to say, "most times you can't tell for lookin' that you're in it." I just learned somethin' awful, absolutely awful. What's the matter, boy? Well, that no matter how hard we try that bartender ain't gonna run outta this wonderful stuff! I mean, we can't drink it all! Put that down, honey, and dance with me! Dance? I shouldn't even be walkin'! Come on, Molly, I'll dance with ya! I wanna dance, too! Honey, you just sit there and act right pretty. Now, if coley was here, he'd dance with me. Amy Jane, coley is not your type. Oh, I know he's not, but he'd dance with me. Well, come on, honey, I'll dance with you too! Whoo-hoo! Well, just goes to prove my timing ain't all that bad, huh? Oh, looky, here's ol' lover boy, goin' home early. But he didn't have as much fun as we did! You get tired of hitchhikin' home at four in the morning? No, he just didn't want to keep us... As a matter of fact, I have cut my evening short to ask you boys a very important question. - Uh-huh. - Oh, yeah! No, no, just, just hold on and listen. What would you boys say of a man who tells his wife he's goin' on a four-day business trip and then cuts it to three days without even lettin' her know? I'd say he's a man that can't be trusted. No siree, he can't! And a man can't be trusted, deserves what he gets! Like a quick buryin'. Oh, mine'll be with a smile of pure contentment, schuster, ol' boy. I'm sorry, but I don't think that's very funny. What's the matter, cotton? Well, she's a married lady! Married, she is... But lady, she ain't. Amy Jane was lookin' for a dance with you, coley. Oh, you know I save the real choice pickin's for you. Yeah, yeah. If I'd have got my hands on him, I'd have blowed his head off. Why, he scared poor Ellie to death! Sick. By damn, sick. Peekin' in on people. He'd have been cured if I'd have caught im. I'll guarantee ya. Cured so he'd never do it again. Movin' on, boy? 'Nother day closer to seein' the pacific ocean. Well, I do envy you that. I reckon I'll never see it. Did a fine job for me, t.J. Thank you for sayin' it. - Mr. Webster? - Comeonin. We're about to head out. Well, I got your money all ready. Say, I'm real pleased with those horses. Good. And I would've liked to have made your stay a little while longer just to see if you'd ever get around to calling me Jim. Much obliged for the work, uh, Jim. And I appreciate you makin' a place for the boy. Speakin' of him, you check your money, and you'll find that four sixes paid his wages. Now, when I asked for a job, I didn't expect you to... Ah, shut up and get the hell outta here. If you ever get by this way again, stop in. Who knows? Things changin' all the time. And I like workin' with a top hand. Take care now. Take care of yourself. Jim, it's donkin! What happened? Look at his hand! Where'd you find him? We was checkin' on Cal down there in the flats and we heard him, screamin' like a banshee up to his cabin. He nearly took all three of us apart when we went to get 'im. It was that coyote that bit him. Well, get him to the hospital. I've seen rabies wipe out a whole herd, Jim. That coyote's got to be dead by now. The question is, how many others did he infect? It's a helluva poor job to offer a top hand. It's a job, and it needs doin'. I'm just sorry I had to get it this way. Well, it's yours as long as you want or until I can offer you somethin' better. T.j.? D'you mind putting off seeing the pacific ocean for a while? I said I was in no hurry. I can wait and see how all this works out. It's workin' out mighty fine, so far. Well, I gotta warn ya, donkin's no great shakes at keepin' up a cabin. It looks okay to me. You gonna ready up the place, are you, boy? Might as well start right off earnin' my keep. Yeah, you heard 'him, Jim. What's that smell? It's been a time since I was down here. I can understand why. How long do you think it'll take you to get it in shape, t.J.? Why don't we just bury it and start all over? You go about it any way you like. I've got some coyotes to find. Jim? Might as well get a look at what there is to see. Yeah, well, you can keep these horses to use here. And I'll ride along with you and show you the areas I was talkin' about. T.j.! Little Tom's comin' to ride me back to the ranch. - You tell him I said wait, huh? - Yessir. There's cattle all up through those flats there... And down into those arroyos there. Hell, all around. The four sixes land, it spreads 30 miles thataway and almost 20 this. Ahhh... Phew. Never want for much, you said, and you'll never be disappointed. Phew. Who helped ya? Friends of the ones who helped you get those coyotes. Nice people. The nicest. You know, we got us a fair amount of bounty money in those hides. I can't rightly figure what to do with mine. Hey, how'd you like to sleep inside tonight? Inside? It's fresher than a cow's breath in there. Come on, I'll show ya. I'm never callin' you boy again. Seein' that you got more gear, I figure that chest for you. Then after we go buyin' me some things, maybe I could use the bottom drawer. That's great. Take a look. Hey, you can see through it! Go see what's to see! Well, I'll be fried. Them stains wouldn't come out, but it's clean. You got first dibs tonight, but from then on we match for it. I'll go fetch some water. I'll get this. Fifty-fifty. You know how long it's been since I had what I just ate? If it's longer'n 14 years, you beat me. - Is that how old you are? - Yep. And you never had one in your whole life? Nope. And if I live to be 111, I'll never have one. Root beer float with pistachio ice cream? Yuck! That's nice. Call me when it comes in and I'll come by and pick it up. Be about a week or 10 days, Maggie. Okay. Thank you. Oh! I"m sorry! Oh, Mr. mackintosh! Mrs. Jenkins. I-1-i-1 should've watched where I was goin'. It was my doing. Uh, I-I sure hope nothin's broke. Luckily, t.J. Was carrying the dishes. He seems to have stayed outta the line of fire. He's smart. Bought us a few things for the cabin. I-, um, I heard that you'd hired on. Little over a week ago. I'm glad for you. Thank you. Uh, the four sixes is a... Is a good place for work. Luke, uh, Luke has been there almost five years. The owners have given, uh, Mr. Webster a free hand, and, uh, he's a, he's a good and generous man. Hey, cotton, you're past it. What are you lookin' at? Maggie Jenkins. Is that mackintosh with her? Yeah. Well, we better get those supplies for Jim. Man, I used to hate this job. Something about it changed, has it? Something's changed. Well, it's not the pacific ocean. Ah, pacific ocean ain't goin' nowhere. For a time, neither am I. You know, a big place I worked in west Texas once had a hand who started there about your age. As a chicken wrangler. Couple years out for war and he came back, ended up as a straw boss. Somethin' to shoot at. Well, what you get in life depends on a couple breaks and how hard you're willing to work for it. Tyin' on to this ranch was a good break. That chicken wrangler. Did he grow up to be a man called mackintosh, by any chance? How come you left a job like that? Probably the same reason you left home. Well, my pa died and my ma, she went lookin' for him, and lord knows how many others. There just wasn't nothin' left for me. When there's nothin' left, you move on. That lady in the picture died? Killed in a car accident. With our son. You know, if you think on it, life would be a lot easier if you didn't get yourself tied too close to other people. Well, I don't know about easier, t.J. For sure, it'd be a lot emptier. Are you gonna read again? How 'bout a game o' checkers? Throw a few knives in the wall? Play catch with some cow flops? Can I take a look at one 0' your books? Help yourself. How long's it been there? Little over a week. Thanks. Hope you enjoy it. Want some help with them supplies? I can manage. Give me some extra cans of peaches. Maggie. How you doin'? Just fine. Oh, the supply house is open. Thank you. Howdy, Mrs. Webster. Oh, hello, Maggie. You got time for a cup o' coffee? I wanna talk to ya about Jim's birthday party. I'll stop by when I'm through. Oh. Good afternoon. Mr. mackintosh. I wasn't expectin' anybody. I didn't mean to startle ya. Not at all. Shoppin' day at the four sixes. Yeah. Spaghetti on your side? Yes, there's some right here. Oh. - Here y'are. - Thank you. People are still talking about how fast you broke them horses. Yeah, a couple of 'em nearly broke me. Never liked the way they break horses. Well, me neither, ma'am, but I'm sure, Mrs. Jenkins, that if we had a little more time we could figure out a way to do it better. Uh. Well, that about does it for me. - See you later. - Bye. - See ya at the birthday party. - The what? A week from Saturday. Mr. Webster's birthday? Oh, I-l hadn't heard about it. Well, you will. Next to the fourth of July, it's the biggest celebration of the year at the four sixes. Well, everybody's invited. People come from all over. It's always a real good... Party. You-you should, uh, try to come to it. Give you a hand, Maggie? Do what? Uh, with your supplies. Oh, I-I'm not through yet. Well, that's about it for me. - Anything wrong? - Uh, what? Well, he wasn't botherin' you, was he? Oh, schuster. For heaven sakes. What d'ya say, Luke? Uh, how's it goin'? One at a time. I got another one for ya. Yeah, I bet you do. The mill over to glory meadows, it needs greasin' somethin' fierce. Well, 'cause I like you so much, I'll put you right at the head of my list. I'll get to it as soon as I finish here. It's just a-whining like a cow fit to breech-birth twins. - How you doin', there, Luke? - Hey, cotton. - Where you been keepin' yourself? - Same place as always. Well, I hadn't seen you around last couple days. Miss me, did ya? Somethin' fierce, yeah. Luke... you got me down as a friend? Now, what the hell's that supposed to mean? Well, I've always figured you for one. We been workin' together now for nearly five years. Why, is somethin' wrong? Yeah, I think there is. Well, what is it? Well, it's personal. It's... Well, if there's anything I can do, boy, you just name it. No, it's somethin' I gotta do. I gotta do it, 'cause you're a friend of mine, and... 'Cause a couple of us have seen it and talked about it. You're blind to it. And because... l gotta stop it right where it's at. Wherever that is. Well, you sure danced around it, whatever it is. You wanna get to it now? It's about mackintosh. Well, what about him? Hey, cotton, what the hell was that all about? J di-so-do... j Ah, you've done it again, ma. They get more fun every year, don't they? Not more work? - Never. - Ahh. Happy birthday. See you round. All right. Two sloe ginners for two fast sinners. - Coley phipps. - There was a time, honey. And my luck had me born too late, huh? Oh, no. Hey, now, the lady who done it all. An awful lot of help. Now don't forget, you promised me a dance. - I won't forget. - Okay. Whoo! Here we go. Thank you. Evenin', everybody. Hi! Isn't this a grand birthday party? Well, it's the first one I've ever been to, but, well, I've heard about 'em for years. It's truly grand. For ol' cotton, here, and me and my wife, it's the fifth'un. Really? My. Evenin'. To Jim, everybody! A lot more parties, a lot more birthdays, so pretty little things like you can come to 'em. I'll drink to that. Let's go find the birthday man. Come and get it! It's pretty good, huh? When you were at the king ranch, did you ever have any dealings with the x.I.T.? Pretty hard not to. You talk about two old-time ranches. Them, the matador, and a few more. They go way back. You'll notice the end of the year is marked by Jim's birthday, not new year's Eve. Seemed that way to me for years. Maggie? I haven't talked to you all night. - Come and sit down. - We're just leavin'. Well, you'll just have to wait a little while. Go on over there, and talk to Jim and the others. Let us have some women talk. You 'bout ready to pack it in, t.J.? - Anytime you are. - Let's do it. We'll say our thanks and head on home. I'd call this a birthday party worth gettin' born for. It sure is. The secret to givin' a party like this is to have a few like Maggie here to do all the work. Well, it's not true, but it's good of you to say so. Not true? Just let me tell ya what this sweet child did. Mrs. Webster? I'm sorry to interrupt you, but t.J. And I are about to head back to the cabin. We just wanted to say our thanks. Ma'am, I've never in my whole entire life been to nothin' what I've been to tonight. Well! Theres gonna be another one next year, the good lord willin', and I hope you're plannin' to be here so you can come to it. The hereford strain that started this place is as pure today as it was when we first came here. You know that. I'm really glad you enjoyed it. Thank you. Ladies. Luke! Come on, let him go! Hold it, hold it, hold it. My god! I was beginning to think this party was a bust here! And you know what that's for, mackintosh. Stay away from my wife. Luke, stop it! Just stay away from her. I'll chalk up what you just said and what you just did to drink. And I'll forget it. But if you ever raise a hand to me again I'll beat you within an inch of your life. And that's a promise. Luke? Luke? Maggie. He's dead. What happened? Luke is dead. Maggie. You said on the phone there was a fight. Yeah, I heard them. They were... they were fighting. I heard them fighting. Come, Maggie. Come inside. Okay. Come on. Ohh! - He's deader'n hell. - Cotton? Whole side of his head's mashed in. Well, did he fall? Like hell, he did. Cory, call the sheriff. My god. Must have been one terrific struggle. Drunk as he was, he must've put up a heck of a fight. Yeah. It ain't hard to figure who with. You don't know that. Let's ask Maggie. Any askin' to be done will be done by sheriff conley. "Til sheriff conley gets here, then, we'll do some checkin' well, if it was mackintosh, he's long gone by now. Let's find out. Cotton. Hold on. Just hold on. Sorry, boss. That ol' boy was a friend o' mine. Well, if you find him, bring him back to me! Understand? Cotton! - What're you doin'? - Where"s mackintosh? - What're you doin' here? - Answer me, boy! - What's wrong? - Where is he?! Well, he went off by himself. He wanted to be alone. Well, why?! Where?! You gotta ask why? You were there. Jim sent us to fetch him. It's about what happened. He wants to see himnow? He sent the four of ya? Look, boy, when you've been here long enough you'll learn that when the boss says do, you do it. Now, where is he? He's down someplace by the river. Tryin' to sort things out. Yeah, that's dead certain. Things are gonna get sorted out. Cotton. Wood smoke. Over there. That's close enough. Not by a damn sight. That pretty well shows the answer. Answer to what? You shoulda cut and run, mackintosh! You couldn't have figured to bluff it out. Bluff what out? You kept your word. Or didn't you know he was dead?! I guess you figured you just cold-cocked him. Stay right where you are. Or I'll brain the first one that steps in. Like you brained Luke? Well then swing on and be damned! You can't take us all! - Crazy fools! - He killed Luke! - Like hell he did! - I say he did! It was coley phipps! You know, he wrote it all down. Everything. We found it in the pocket of his coat, and, well... Couple of you boys, give a hand. You know, my wife had a talk with Maggie... Where Luke got that crazy idea he had? Well, it-it was wrong. Is she gonna be all right? She'll be all right. It's just gonna take a little time. Are you figurin' to turn north at 'askell? Haskell? You said if you didn't tie into somethin' that you was gonna turn north. I said that, but... You know, it's been over 30 years since I saw the pacific ocean. Yeah? We could look for work along the way and take our time gettin' there. I said all along, I was in no hurry.
