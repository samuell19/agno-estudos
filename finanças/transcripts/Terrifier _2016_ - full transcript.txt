Welcome back to the program. If you're just tuning in, I'm sitting here live with the sole survivor of the Miles County Massacre, Which occurred exactly one year ago today. I've worked on this show for many years and I've never sat across from someone. Who has a story to tell quite like yours. Thank you again for taking the time. To sit down and speak with me. It's my pleasure. Now when we left off we were talking. About the moment you woke up from the coma. Do you remember your initial reaction. When you first saw your face? Yes. Would you like to share that with us? I wished I was dead. Do you still feel that way? People are frightened by the way that I look, especially children. And it's really difficult for me to deal with that, So isolation is ideal. Now what about your attacker, A man identified only as Art the Clown? There's a lot of controversy surrounding his supposed death. The authorities issued a statement claiming that his body disappeared from the county coroner's office. The morning after the attack. He's dead. I saw it happen. Did you watch it? Oh my God, I thought she was going to attack me. My heart was pounding the entire time. Yeah well, if you think she looks that bad on television, Imagine what she looks like sitting two feet away from you. I thought I was going to gag at one point. Babe, do me a favor. If I ever look like that, promise me. You'll put me out of my misery. You think I'm kidding? I'll do it myself. Yeah, Tom said we won't know until the morning. But he thinks the ratings are going to go up big time. Exactly. We've finally figured out the formula for success, Faceless victims and a host in jeopardy. Yeah, watch next month, it's going. To be called Monica's House of Horrors. Shit. Hey, can I call you back? I have like 50 people calling me. Okay- Alright, love you too. Bye. Hello? Tom? I think I just twisted my ankle. Dawn, really? Thanks a lot, by the way. For what? Promising you weren't gonna get shit faced tonight. Guys kept buying me drinks. I can't help it if people find me interesting. Yeah. Definitely your mind that they were after. Who are you texting? None of your business. You gave that asshole your number, didn't you? Oh my god, you're so jealous. Of what? That kid was talking to like five other girls. Oh, stop being such a bitch. Just get in the car. Oh, you are not driving. I'm fine. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. Dawn, I don't feel like dying tonight. ' Really? Are we really gonna do this right now? Give me the keys. I'm gonna paw at you like a cat. Give me what I want. Okay, okay, okay, okay. You drive. Thank you. I'm fucking lit. But if I get something to eat, I can drive us, okay? There's a place that's open late, we can sober up. Did you say food? I said food. You know the place, it's right there, come on. Okay, okay, Okay- Just like give me one minute. Fuck me. Like one minute, for real. D. (E)- What? Look. Holy shit. Yeah, that's not funny. I'm about to scream. Hey, handsome. Dawn, cut it out. My friend wants your number. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Come buy us dinner. Stop- Just shut the fuck up. Or what? Maybe he'll drive us home. I'm sorry, she's drunk. Let's go. Come on. Let's just go. Oh yeah? You get dressed up? Oh, you're a sick fuck. Where am I gonna go? Back to my wife? Same shit. Maybe another two hours? Alright. Alright, bye- - Great. Ugh. That was the longest piss I have ever taken. Thank you for sharing that. This guy wants me to meet him at his apartment right now. What a shocker. I told him I would. What? I'm kidding. I have a little more self respect than that. If you only had a brain. I've been wanting to use that one all night. Congratulations. Look it's your boyfriend. I told you this a week ago, we'll go to your mother's. I don't know, six weeks from now. I'll be right with you buddy. You gotta see the shape of this fuckin' guy that just walked in. ' Are you okay? I think we should get our food to go. Why? Him? Seriously, I wanna leave. Jesus Christ. D, stop- - Uh, excuse me? Excuse me? Can I get a picture with you? Dawn, come on. Shut up. Hello? Hello? Okay- I'm gonna take that as a yes. Oh. Oh. Sorry. Thanks. What the hell is wrong with you? What? Did you think he was gonna hack me up into little pieces or something? What can I get for you buddy? Hey? Hello? If you don't order anything, you're gonna have to leave. You already have eight likes. Can you hear me in there? Oh god, it's gonna be a long night. Aww. What are you doing? Thanks. Okay, not for nothing, but that's the nicest thing. A guy's done for you all night. Seriously? What the fuck? Here you go ladies. Yes. You two okay? Oh, he's harmless. You okay? Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Enjoy your pizza. What do you keep staring at? That bag. What do you think is in it? I don't know, who cares? Just eat your food. You fuckin' freak! Get over here. All night with you, you fuck. Enough. Get outta here. Take your shit, and don't come back. Ramon, grab a mob and some bleach. Eh, you okay? Yeah, I'm alright. What do you think that guy did in there? Who knows. Probably jizzed all over the place, fucking pervert. ' Stop. What? I'm telling you that guy totally whacked off in there. He was obviously turned on by you. You're fuckin' sick. You know that? What? - Look at your hand. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Look, at least he had the courtesy to do. Whatever he did in private. I mean, he could have whipped it out right there. I really don't need the visual. Well are you okay to drive? Yeah, trust me, that sobered me right the fuck up. - Oh my god. - What? Your tire. Fuck me. Has it been like this the whole time? I think I would have said something if I'd noticed. That your tire had exploded. Why does this shit always happen to me? Do you have a spare? It's on the car. Wow. I'm starting to feel sick. Just, give me your phone. I'll call my sister. Yo Steve, this is sick. I better get overtime for this. No joke, this is disgusting. You got me cleanin' piss and shit at one o'clock. In the morning. Let the guy who handles food take care of it, Real fuckin' sanitary. Steve, time and a half, or I'm out. You hear me? Hello? Hi, it's me. Tara? Yeah, my phone died. I'm calling from Dawn's. Ah. Your phone died. Can you ever go out without using social media. Every 30 seconds? I think you're the only one in America. Who has that sort of restraint. Yeah, that's probably right. Did I wake you? No, I am studying for my midterm tomorrow. Oh, shit. Why, what is it? What is it, Tara? Dawn and I are sort of stranded right now. She has a flat tire and no spare. And I was kind of hoping you could pick us up? I have to be up in five hours, Tara. Yeah, I know Vic. Don't bother, seriously. I didn't realize you had a test. Sorry. I didn't know you were here. You know what? I gotta stretch my legs and besides, if I fail, I can always blame you. You are the best sister in the world. Yeah. Where are you? What's wrong? I'm fine. Why? You keep looking over your shoulder. Just thinking. About? Nothing. Tell me. What if that guy did this to your car? What guy? The clown? I'm serious. Well, you really think someone slashed my tires? Well, he knows this is your car. He saw us getting into it earlier. That's fucking ridiculous. I probably just ran over a nail or something. I should have just let you drive. Yeah, you should have. But as usual, you have to be the good Samaritan so here we are. Stuck. Like a couple of assholes. Steve! Oh fuck! Help! Somebody! Yeah, but what if I'm right, And he's out there watching us right now? Show him your tits. I don't know, Tara. Look, that guy was harmless. He's just some douchebag in a costume. Acting like a retard because it's Halloween. No. He was different. He smiled. The way he kept staring at us with those dead eyes. What was in that bag? I don't know, Tara. The point is, he's gone, And you're never gonna see him again. So cut the shit, 'cause you're starting to freak me out. I really have to pee. So go. _ Go? Go where? It's the middle of the night. I can't just pop a squat in the middle of the street. And pee like you do. Well tough shit, because it's gonna be a while. Before your sister gets here. Fuck. Maybe that guy has a bathroom that you can use. _ who? That creepy guy who just got out of that. Even creepier looking building. Tara. I was kidding. Excuse me? _ Yes? I'm sorry to bother you. Is there a bathroom in there I could use? Sorry, I don't own the place. I'm not supposed to let anyone in here. Please, mister, it's an emergency. I'll be two seconds. Honestly, I could get in a lot of trouble. Who's gonna know? Just let her use the bathroom, for god sakes. She'll make it worth your while. A friend of yours? Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk. It's been a long night. Alright. Just make it quick, okay? Thank you. Guy's even weirder looking than the clown was. This way. Good thing you called me when I did. I was about to bomb the hell out of this place. Bomb? Bug bomb. Pest control. What kind of pest? You sure you want me to tell you before you use the bathroom? Why? Don't tell me it's roaches. It's not roaches. Oh good. It's rats. Rats? All clear. Are you sure? Rat free. What if one crawls out of the toilet? I'd make it quick if I were you. Good plan. Do you need me to wait for you or? I'll be alright. You remember how we came in? I remember. _ Okay- Well, um, you have a nice night then. You too. Thanks again. Don't mention it.
