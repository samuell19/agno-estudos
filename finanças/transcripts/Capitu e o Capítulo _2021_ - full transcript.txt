They call me Casmurro. This is not my real name, it's a nickname. A nickname that became my name. I'm writing this book, where all I confess will become my story. Montaigne once wrote: "ce ne son pas mes gestes que j'ecris; c'est moi, c'est mon essence." Are you afraid? Afraid? Yes, I asked if you were afraid? Afraid of what? Afraid of being hit... of being hit in the face, getting punched in the mouth, being pummeled, of getting arrested, of fighting, of walking, of working... I don't understand. Being beaten? Yes, getting beaten. Who's hitting me? Who is this that's beating me up? Coward! Tell me something, but be honest, don't sugarcoat it. What is it? Say it. If you had to choose between me and your mother, who would you choose? Me? I would choose... Why do I have to choose? Mother would never ask me such a thing. Maybe so... Your mother wouldn't ask, but I'll ask. Me or your mother? Come on... are you afraid to say it? Me or her in every way. Who would you choose? Suppose you are at university and receive word I will die... Don't say such a thing! Or I'll kill myself from loneliness if you don't come soon, and your mother doesn't want you to come. Tell me, would you come? I would. Against your mother's wishes? Against Mother's wishes. You would leave university, leave your mother, leave everything behind to watch me die? Don't talk about dying. Liar. Transformation of the soul, a surprising art, elevating things to the point of connecting to what is vulnerable. There are souls darker than night... destiny isn't just a playwright, it's also its own rule-breaker. A writer friend once told me something wise: That was a family. A very old-fashioned family. Nowadays with poisoned souls, they hate each other. That's when it presented itself. It appeared during the few hours when daylight fights with the dark and you don't know if it's morning or night. It was hatred that caused the scene... She was on fire, her spirit agitated, she tore off her dark silk robe until nearly bare. What she showed was so strong, forceful. that it blinded me... A sun that floods and represses the darkness. She pulled the neckline of her blouse so much as to expose her breasts, these two Greek pears under candlelight... She was intoxicating and it gave me courage. It may sound silly, or something worse, but my spirit found itself hearing old and dangerous words: dare all that a man has to dare... but, I restrained myself. She kept on... The wine, deep red in color, that assaulted her by gulps... In a low voice she whispered obscenities so intimate they are best silenced. She screamed she would squeeze every last cent out of the family. Only when the money runs out will I stop, she said. She sang in the nude with destructive purpose, to disrepute those around her. Cursed all her relatives, one by one. That's why she fell. The world is disenchanted, the damage is done. Nothing is left of the old world all its supernatural creatures have been cast out... Apparently, our liking for imitating the French is a mistake. If I had known, I wouldn't have said it, but I did to comply with my painfully bitter duty... Greek pear! Spirit on fire!! Supernatural creatures!!! Imitate the French!!! Old-fashioned, strong, and bitter! Love excellence... It wounds, and it cures! Later, when I discovered Achilles' spear had also cured the wound it created. I searched in old books, dead books, buried books, for the piece to the puzzle. I hunted the worms that had eaten the books in hopes they could tell me what was in the text they had eaten. A long fat worm said to me: we know nothing of the words we eat, we do not choose what we consume, nor do we love or hate what we chew, we eat. All the worms, in their discrete silence, repeat this same verse... Abuna, Acarai, Acarape, Assup?, Amiriz, Aquidab?, Atirib?, Bangu, Bariri, Beberibe, Bocaina, Botucatu, Brocoi?, Caboclos, Cabu?u, Caj? Catete, Gamboa, Ipanema, Iraj?, Itamarati, Jaboat?o, Jaguaribe, Jo?, Mamor?, Maracan?, Maric?, Matup?, Piracinunga, Piumb?, Pucurui, Quatis Tijuca, Uruguaiana, Igarapava... Sambaiba... Aperana. Listen to what Lima Barreto says: The writer, geographer, anarchist and vegetarian, Elisee Reclus, when writing his Universal Geography, in reference to Brazil, he remarked on the need to preserve the Tupi names of locations. The great French geographer said the names have value in the clear sense the words possess. They express a fact of nature, the color of the running waters, the height, the form or aspect of the rocky formations, he remarked on the need to preserve the Tupi names of locations. In Rio de Janeiro there are Tupi names that are so eloquent, the translations of the form or the charm of certain places leave one astonished with the discovery of their meanings, their poetic power, the force of the superior emotion of which these primitive cannibal inhabitants of this region were capable. The names of the bays alone. How is the seduction, the nature, the fascination, not well translated in the name Guanabara - breast of the sea? And if the sea opened here, its breast hid itself among the waters of Niteroi - hidden water. Let's go back to Lima Barreto: These Tupi names of the natural accidents surrounding the city are the oldest documents it possesses of the lives that here flourished and died. The sea? I've swum past the bay, into open sea. Great swimmer... on his front or on his back... on his back he's faster... shreds into the water... he likes to go deep... beating it within... he never tires, he has gills! He's always harnesses the rough sea. Let's go out? I'll only leave here if it's cloudy. Bored of me already? Me? Seems like it. You're such a child. You want to swap our peaceful attire for embittered armor? What, I've waited all this time? Waited so many years to become bored in just seven days? No Bentinho... It's what I really want. I want it because I desire it just as much. Desire what as much? What? What was, what is, what is yet to be and what will never cease to be. I have this bright light inside me. I've received the best present a person can. I've received the best present a person can be treasured... time that cannot be lost. Let's go out tomorrow. Are you lazy or afraid? Must we leave during the best part? Ready to experience the secret? Have you never dreamed? Never awoke at night, steam rising from your body, covered in sweat, thinking the curtain was about to open? To take the stage? To put on our play? A long play with ten acts, fifteen acts, that you beg to never end... You want to slam the door to Heaven in my face? No is no. It must be overcast. Clou-dy skies. The literary world has suffered a notable loss, or at least contemporary Brazilian poetry has. There is suspicion a dark star shines its tragic light near the graves of modern Brazilian poets. All of them died around 25 years of age. It seems as if the poets of our land are shadowed by maleficent star fairies. Castro Alves, Alvares de Azevedo, Junqueira Freire, Casimiro de Abreu, Macedo Junior, Dutra Mello, Bernardino Ribeiro... Franco S?, who died with twenty years of age in 1856... All poets, exquisite poets, sensitive spirits, musical spirits, rare spirits, drunk on Byron and camphor... ?lvares de Azevedo, the young author of Mac?rio, of Night in the Tavern, died at 21 years old. "Oh the pages of life I loved..." Azevedo along with Junqueira Freire are local products, indigenous to Brazil. They are mediums of Brazilian culture. Alvares de Azevedo pulls us from an outdated mental influence. He was a laborer chained to the soil. He would read everything in its original form by Greek, Latin, English, French, Italian, German, and writers. Shakespeare, Tasso, Byron, Goethe, Heine, Musset, Victor Hugo, Shelley, Sand... These were his most cherished writers. What he read and what he preferred he took from Rio de Janeiro. From here he took the paintings of his imagination, sparked by the lush beauty of this region. His melancholy was innate to him, from his idealist and intelligent nature. Nowadays his work is often forgotten or unknown. Or perhaps even worse it has gone ignored. But our country is this way, it always has been, undeniable mediocrity transformed overnight into colossal notoriety... A french poet do not speak in "eternity", but in "eternal invalidity", the meaning contradicts itself... Listen to what Alvares de Azevedo wrote, how he breathed, you will hear something of his idealism: "It's not to drag oneself by worn elbows, have a pillow as hard as rock, I know... the world is a lost quagmire, the sun of which, if I only had, is money." Between terror and laughter, side by side, is where many great poets have lived... Franco S? wrote the following verses: "Ah! Lucky young man, I promise you if today you are the weak-kneed, trembling groom, kissing the petticoat that envelops your staff maybe, once a husband, death will fall upon you to then rise a pallid skeleton, from the dense cloud of eight skirts." He was twenty years old... A secret about to reveal: a trip to Europe, us four. We're all going? We're all going. Whatever you tell me, I'll believe you. Whatever I tell you? Tell you what? Tell me... Tell me you want to take me to a castle... To a gloomy setting at the top of a hill, standing on a cliff, off in the distance way up high... A castle? A castle with one hundred, two hundred, one thousand rooms... where one passes by everything and where one sees everything... all the doors are open... inside is a long staircase, anger, poured milk, white and warm drool, drowns me, chokes and suffocates me... It gets so hot it explodes into dizzying mirage... Don't move Sancha, don't move... But I want to move... I want to give in... Surrender to that slow, delicious strangulation... the release of the leather wrapped around my neck, the prelude of the disgrace that accentuates my desire... a different future, I don't care... an eternal, magical offering... I want to be put under a spell... possessed... become intoxicated, inhale ether... camphor... an entire night of indulgence. I've never felt this way before. How do you feel? I don't know... I hesitate between me and myself... I feel fine... it's that... I'm undoing a rainbow thread by thread... Some women become red when they kiss. Some bite. I die. I die inside when I kiss... I die and go to heaven. Put your hand here, at the base of my neck... that's it, wrap your hand around... I want to feel your fingers around my neck. So tight I can't breathe, let me go blue, squeeze me until I explode. Has anyone ever been promised so much? All at once? Could the child be his? And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, on the pallid bus of Pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming, and the lamp-light over him streaming throws his shadows on the floor, and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore! You make me want... to dig my nails into your neck, dig them in until life flows out of your body with blood. The dark wave of resentment surged from within the home, drowned the walls from floor to ceiling. Human brutality tumbled obliviously within the universal stillness of things... As unhappy actors, they continue on to the conclusion of a poorly represented drama. I can't... I'm not the father. What? You didn't hear what I said? That he isn't my son. What gave you that idea? Did you hit your own head with a hammer? Tell me, tell me everything, then after I've listened, I want to hear the rest, it can't be much. Come on Bentinho, tell me. There are things one doesn't say. Don't tell me just half of it. Since you've already told this much, tell me all of it. Spill it! A separation is something that is decided. It would have been best if we did it with vagueness or in silence, each with their own wounds. But since you insist, this is what I can tell you. Escobar has always been a lewd, womanizer. He had a lover... a theater actress... a ballerina... Ballerina...? A dancer, she's like a leaf that gets blown from one gutter to another... it's easy to get up her skirts, she was fine with anything... they lived in indecency. He is the father of that child. Es-co-bar? Even the deceased! What imagination Bentinho! Escobar, a swimmer, with strong arms... You liked him. I always knew it... In bed... gave you my back and became Escobar for you... I remember well, it was a palace, similar to Quinta da Regaleira in Sintra called the Temple of Love. Only the nobles frequented... they were all very discrete... But... what about rooms for couples? For couples on their honeymoon? With mirrors on the ceiling? The most sought after were the even rooms 4, 6, and 8. They said it was heaven. And it was! This is good-bye Bentinho. Good-bye Capitu, I don't know if you will see me again... I'm going to another Europe, one that is timeless, I'm already aboard, aboard... Europe... My pilgrimage is a sentimental one for this world... I follow my destiny... Whoever lives among the stars, dies among the stars... The old Europe... Everlasting... I'm going to the inside of the earth, behind the truth like that of beautiful youth... Here... we are a world on loan... It's a lover's scene. A scene of everlasting love... Not all poets are as fortunate as Junqueira Freire, who lived a life of legendary and Romanesque circumstances. He was a friar, his poetry was written in the cloister. His figure stands out in the solitary background of his cell, his chest constricted by despair and remorse. Junqueira writes: "I also fantasized about beautiful image of serene life. I also desired the happy refuge of the sterile cloister." Whatever sincerity was behind his pain, it could never be believed by the commoner, to whom is not bestowed the scrutinization of all the depth of the human soul. Junqueira Freire, although uncultured, that poetry was his. In this, there is a feeling of the precious virtue known as: poetic individuality. He had language of his own, he was a poet. A poet for great heights... He died at 22 years old, nearly not enough time to... "In the filthy game of impure lasciviousness, the murderous miscreant descends from the altar, from the miscreant to the bright pulpits, your clamor flatters the addicted, here where crimes quiver with fear and the red lips of feminine kisses trigger lightning that terrifies passions." Junqueira's poetry is strong, at least to me it seems strong... Oh Mangueira, you are a picture of a beauty that nature created, oh oh what splendor is the sunrise upon your hills of zinc shanties everyone recognizes you from afar by the sound of your tambourine and the beat of your drum oh oh oh oh Mangueira has arrived, oh oh oh oh oh oh Mangueira has arrived, oh oh Mangueira, your glorious past is recorded in history. The green and pink of your flag represent to the people that the samba is there at Mangueira. Hardsubs transcript by gooz
