[gentle music playing] [Akin] This is my city. And these are my toys: the houses, the boats, the cars, and the financial business that pays for it all. [sighs] And this is me, Akin Holloway. The Holloway family has been Lagos royalty for generations. [birds chirping] I want to leave my kingdom to my daughters. A "happily ever after" in marriage is gold. [Akin] This one, I paid for her MBA, but she wants to be a marriage counselor. I am Tokunboh Holloway. [Akin] And this one: she might look a little bit wild. -I am ready! -[girl] Right there! [Akin] But she also thinks she's going to be the biggest screenwriter in Nollywood. But my life isn't about relaxing at the pool... You're here? It takes brains to hold on to all this wealth because there's always someone ready to take everything away from you. And there's always someone ready to spend it. Everything about this dress. [Akin] Meet my wife. My party must be unrivaled in the land of Eko partydom... the big boys and the inner caucus of the Lagos elite, the custodians of Lagosian class, the one percent of the one percent. -[car horns honking] -[light music playing] Baba, [chuckles] are you sure you're ready? [Baba Eko, in Yoruba] See this, little child. [in English] You don't have respecto. [Akin] Sometimes, you don't realize things are about to fall apart... and it starts with something really small... -[laughs] She needs to be taught a lesson. -[Iris chuckles] [Akin] ...like a game of tennis. [men laughing] -[Akin] What kind of disrespect is that? -[Baba Eko] Greetings, sir. What? -[Iris makes soothing sound] Baba. -Hm? So, uhm, I want to go and take off all my clothes and stand under the shower. [excited exclamation] [Iris] Do you want to come with me? That is very important, eh? -[in Yoruba] Don't be too long. -[Iris, in Yoruba] Don't worry! -[disappointed exclamation] -[excited exclamation] -All right, Akin. -Sir? This is my finger, bet it. Yes, sir. -You see that girl? -Yes, sir. -Huh? This girl? -Yes, sir. [in Yoruba] She will nearly die tonight. [singing in Yoruba] ♪ She will nearly die tonight ♪ ♪ She will nearly die tonight ♪ [shrieks] [car horns honking] [reverend] Oloye Alabi Ojo, who peacefully transited to glory after a short game of tennis, was above all... a faithful husband and a good father, to the end. [choir singing] [people murmuring] [gentle piano music playing] Look at her lips, -like a slit in the middle of her face. -[Kiki, disgusted exclamation] All the foundation in the world and her wrinkles have wrinkles. -[chuckles] -[Ngozi Gomez, in Yoruba] Devil. She's coming, she's coming. [woman] OK... Oh... [Mopelola] You look beautiful, as usual. And Kiki, when did you come back? -[Kiki] A week ago. -[Mopelola] Ah... My deepest condolences. Your mentor was a great man. But you know, AMCON will soon be paying you a visit. -[chuckles] -But the righteous are bold as a lion. Righteous? [laughs] Oh, come on, Akin. Uh... Look, I am privy to your non-performing loans in billions of naira. You know, they couldn't touch you because of Baba... but now that he's gone... [laughs] [stutters] be expecting them. You know, you're right, Alhaji. -Yeah. -Yes, you're right. But some conversations are inappropriate where we come to honor the dead. Ah... Yeah. Anyway. Uh... See you. Uh... You have a good day. [stutters] What did he want? He brought up AMCON. How stupid of him to have done that. But Akin, we have avoided that subject, uh, since Baba died. We can't afford to anymore. -[Akin sighs] I know, Grey. -Hm-mm. -Hm? -[sighs] Let's go. ["Designer" by Niniola and Sarz playing] [lively music playing] [indistinct chattering] Kiki, pass me the wine, please, darling. [Mopelola] Mm... Wait a minute, Okikiola Princewill, these are not the breasts you left Lagos with. [chuckles] God no, those were sagging balloons. [Mopelola] Mm... But these are a magnificent work of art. -They look like A-class melons. -[woman exclaims in agreement] -But I've told you ladies before... -What is it? ...that me and those Abuja slay-bitches that want to keep taking our husbands in the Senate, we will die there. [chuckles] Plus, my dear Femi, he has been rushing home every weekend to these awesome babies. [women] Oh really? [women laughing] Kiki, don't you think you have done one too many of these cosmetic arrangements? Yes, but the wonders of plastic surgeries. I mean, it's amazing how they can turn an ugly duckling -into a swan... I mean, just like that. -[dishes clinking] What do you mean "ugly duckling"? -[Mopelola stutters] -But you need some work done. -[stutters] -Don't be jealous of me. All you need to do is ask, and I'll give you their contact. It's not that difficult. Uh-huh! Besides... these awesome babies have their benefits... all day, every day. [women shrieks] -[Mopelola] Kiki, he's just a baby. -[women laughing] -[indistinct speech] -[woman] Gosh! [lively drumming music] Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni... -Just look away, just look away. -[person clearing throat] [Dunni] You people, huh! -Hey! -[women exclaim happily] [in Yoruba] Stop with the pretense. You people did not miss me. [indistinct chattering] [Kiki] How was your Scotland trip? [Dunni] Uh, it was fine, yo. I had mad fun. Uh... I went to the, uhm... this place, Edibug. It's pronounced "Edinburgh". Edinbra? -Edinburgh. -...bra? [in Yoruba] Look, it's all the same. [in English] I went on a shopping spree. I bought Gooki. -Gooki? -[Dunni] Yes. I bought Burberry. -[Mopelola] Hm... -I bought LV. -I bought, uhm... -[Mopelola] LV? -There's this one-- -Basically you just did mad shopping. Did you follow me? [woman in Yoruba] This girl is a bastard. [Dunni] Anyway, if you have any party, make sure you call me. -Of course. -You understand? Like that, your party of last year. [in Yoruba] I will come and turn the place upside down. Spray money. -The Caribbean themed party? -[women] Oh, yeah! It was all right, I suppose. All right? What are you talking about? It was voted top Lagos party by Society Forbes. Girl, now wait for my 50th, come next March. [women exclaim in surprise] I will be sure to send you an invite. Oh? Not before I send you one for my 51st in October. Hm... Where will that be? Oh, Akin and I haven't decided yet. Somewhere different. Maybe a cruise in Brazil. Or something like that. -[women exclaim in surprise] -We'll make up our minds later. [Dunni] Mm. Great, great combination. [in Yoruba] Anyway, I'm hungry. [in English] Server! -Jollof rice and moin-moin. -I think they have amala here. -I saw amala. -[Dunni] No, it's a class party. -[Mopelola] Oh... That's natural. -[Dunni] Jollof rice. From now on, no unwarranted purchases. We have to lay low. No noise. [Grey] Hm... Good idea, that's a good one. [Akin] That's the best way to go about it, as far as I'm concerned, if you ask me. Uncle AK. Congratulations. I can't wait to be at Aunty's turn up this year. What's that? [scoffs] Uncle, you need to be woke. Turn-up is a party! Yes, I know, we're not having any. But I overheard Aunty telling her friends -that we're having a party this year. -Hm-mm? [in Yoruba] This woman will not ruin my life. -[gentle music playing] -[car horns honking] Fifty-first birthday party! Who does that... Mope? Oh, for goodness sake, Akin. [in Yoruba] Leave me alone. -[in Yoruba] I should leave you alone? -[scoffs] After your news has traveled half across the world. Well, I wasn't talking to the world. I was talking to Oge. And if the news has gotten out that I'm going to have another fabulous party next year, frankly, it's no fault of mine. I totally forgot you're not one to be reasoned with. Oh! I can be reasoned with if you upgrade your IQ to the level where I can be persuaded. [in Yoruba] Me? [scoffs] Look, you know what? I'm staying back at the hotel, after my meeting. Oh, thank you, honey. More space for me in the bed. And certainly no snoring. [driver] Oga, Madam. Will you like some music from this radio? -[in Yoruba] Shut up! -My friend, you look at what you're doing! -[Akin] Music ko, Beat FM ni. -[Mopelola] Twat. [lively music playing] [knock on door] [Akin] Who is it? [Kaima] Edible catering. So... it has to take a fight with Mopelola to get you to stay here? Come here... So, did you miss me? Of course I did. [sinister music playing] [Kaima groans sensually] [upbeat music playing] [Demidun chuckles] Wait, Mommy is throwing a birthday party this year? [music continues softly in background] OK, Daddy, I know that you called thinking I would be upset with Mommy too, but you know that this apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Yes, I'll be in her corner. OK, Daddy. Bye. [chuckles] [George] What? Mommy is throwing a party for her 51st birthday. Why am I not surprised? George, you... You know that... we haven't done anything together in a long time and planning Mommy's birthday party would help us get back on track and be awesome again. Right. I'm... I'm going to be late. I have to beat traffic. [somber music playing] You forgot your ring. Right. Have a safe flight. -[door clicks shut] -[sighs] [flute playing on TV] -[on TV] You! Give me back my love! -[phone ringing] [indistinct talking on TV] [indistinct talking on TV] Hello. Demidun. Mommy is throwing another birthday party? Typical of your mother. She's more interested in throwing a big birthday party with everything that is going on to show that she's the socialite of the year. Yeah, I'm at my meeting. [scoffs] As in I am watching this God-awful movie. My brain actually hurts. [scoffs] OK. Bye, sis. Huh-uh. It's like you don't like the film. Sorry, your voice was so loud. Forgive me for making it easy for you to eavesdrop. Are you waiting for somebody? Apparently not. I have no better use of my time than sitting down here and losing precious brain cells to a Nollywood travesty. -[laughs] -Excuse me, hi. Please, do you work here? I have been waiting for five minutes. [receptionist] Oh! I am so sorry. The receptionist on duty actually called in sick, -so I took-- -Can we just skip to the part where I see Mr. Nnamdi Agwu? I have a meeting with him, and I have been waiting for more than five minutes. This is the Mr. Nnamdi Agwu here, our CEO. [uneasy music playing] Uhm... It is I, Nnamdi Agwu, CEO, Ebubedike Pictures International. [laughs] You must be... -Tokunboh Holloway? -Tokunboh. Oh, the scriptwriter. -The screenwriter, yes. -I have been waiting for you. Let us go to my office where you can tell me more about this travesty. [light music playing] [Kaima exclaims sensually] You know, I could get used to this. With him, it's... it's just two minutes. And twice a month, if I'm lucky. But with you... Akin... please take me on a holiday. You know that's not going to happen. Why not? We'll travel separately. We'll arrive at the same spot. It'll be magical. It would be foolish. -Foolish? -Hm... But Akin, we are both married to the wrong people. My husband is a sorry case... -and, and your wife, Mopelola, she-- -[Akin, in Yoruba] Shut up! [in English] Don't you ever mention my wife again, especially as long as she is Mrs. Holloway. Never ever compare yourself to her. [laughs in disbelief] Sweetheart, please come and go. Please. Now, look, I have enough issues as it is on my own... and I can't add you to it. [Nnamdi] Nne, everybody says you're the best. That's really kind of them. You see, this is my first cinema film. I want it to be tough! I totally get you on that one. You're shaking. It's like you are nervous. Do you want me to call my assistant to get you something to drink, something that will help you calm your nerves? Awesome. Scotch or vodka will be perfect for me. No, no, no. Nne. That is alcohol. It is too early in the day for alcohol. You know what, never mind. Please forgive me. This isn't me at all. It's that time of the month. [stutters] PMS? No, my village people. They're tweeting everything that I'm saying. I like that. I like this one. You're funny. Either way, just disregard everything that I've said before now. If you give me a chance, I would actually prove myself to you, -and I would do better. -No, no, no, no, no. My dear, I like you the way you are. I like people that are very real. -[laughs, in Igbo] You understand? -Yeah. What you said to me downstairs, I love it. -If you like what I did yesterday... -Hm-mm? ...that means you cannot help me get to where I'm going to tomorrow. I have conquered Asaba. Look behind me. All of these are my awards. This one here: Certificate of Market of Excellency. The whole market people gather and gave me award. -Fantastic. -This one here is a certificate of achievement, given by the Aba Boys' Clan Worldwide Global International. -Fantastic. -All of this place here is award. -Woman, you know what I want to do now? -Hm-mm? I want to break into the Lagos market. Cinema. As I'm talking to you right now, -I have about four investors... -Oh. Really? ...that are ready to drop 50 million naira, cash! Fifty million? -Yes. -Wow. All they want from me is to, is to give them a... a blockbuster. -Epic! That is where you come in. -Yeah. OK. OK. I want you to write something down for me. Something that is going to, you know, shake everybody. Trust me, shaking people is kinda like my forte. I know that you and me together, we are going to create magic. -Let me call my assistant. Cold Coke. -Yeah. I will take that Coke now. [laughs] [light music playing] [Shaggy] Chukwuemeka and the fishpond! Great man! [chuckles] Good day, sir. Good morning. -How are you, Shaggy? -I'm fine, sir. Sir, I just want to say the food is ready, and the table is set, with a variety of dishes. [in Pidgin] Your family is already seated at the table. [in Pidgin] They want to start enjoying the food... [in Pidgin] but are waiting for you to come. Thank you, Shaggy. All right, sir. Is there anything else? I don't want to say much. I just wanted to say you look fine, and you are looking agile. White lion! And I also pray that God will always grant you good health. -I also want to... -Thank you, Shaggy. wish you happy Christmas in arrears. -Thank you, Shaggy. -Thank you, sir. Thank you. God bless you. -Hey. -Huh-uh. How did it go? It did not go well. You should have gone with me. Overseas, they say, "Behind every successful man is a successful woman." Since you did not go with me, I could not say anything. -You didn't say anything there? -I didn't. When we need your manliness, it doesn't show up. All you do is joke around like a comedian. Forget that. If you had gone with me, I would have been motivated. Let us go and cuddle so that-- Get out of here! Cuddling is not for poor people. What? Who is poor? Don't you know I am talented? -What talent? -I am talented! I am a future rich man! What future? You are old! Not much future left for you! Don't laugh. This doesn't concern you. My future is over, right? You haven't heard me sing. Come let me give you one track. I don't want to get pregnant in poverty! I'm not getting you pregnant. Let me give you one track. All right. Give it to me. [singing in Pidgin] Get out of here. -I am not done. -What are you finishing? I don't want a poor musician. I want Lil Wayne. Little win. [gentle music playing] Yup. Actually, a thriller. What I really want, you know, is chance to do something like my favorite show ever: -Game of Thrones. -Yeah. -That would definitely-- -[Mopelola] There will be no talk of Nollywood movies at this table. An Oxford-trained lawyer turned Nollywood scriptwriter is not something we are going to celebrate in this household. Mommy, this is your last chance. -Hm-mm. -Either accept what I do for a living, or I will cancel your name from my Oscar acceptance speech. -I'm so bothered. -[laughing] Anyways, uhm, I'll jump straight to the reason why I called this meeting. [in Yoruba] What is it? -They should excuse us? -I want to talk with them. Yes. Move! Out! Be sharp. -[in Yoruba] You too! -Me too? OK. Sorry. Madam, please, anytime you need me, or you need me to clear the plates, -please call me. -[Mopelola] Yes. -I'll be in the kitchen. -[Mopelola] Yes, Aunty Joy. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. [Akin] Well, like I was saying, there are rumors around town that, uhm, our company is being hit by hard times. And all I can say is that I'm on top of it. But you see, at this particular point in time, I need us all to keep our heads down. Because what we do or say at this time will decide if we sink or if we survive. Needless to say, we're the Holloways. To some of you, it might just be a surname, but to this city, it is a monument from the times of Pa Dehinde Holloway. All the generations of the Holloways have made sure... that they did good by the Holloway name. So I'll be damned to be the one to change the status quo. Quite right. Daddy, we're talking about keeping a low profile, and at the same time, planning Mommy's party. -To me, that's like-- -Aha! -I was coming to that. -Excuse you? [in Yoruba] Mope, be patient. [in English] Now... I deeply feel-- [Mopelola] No. Wait, wait, wait. Is this some kind of disguised intervention? Oh, so you and the children planned this in order to twist my arm so I that I won't have my 51st birthday, -is that what it is? -[girls] No, it's actually not like that-- Oh, shut up, you dingbats. Do I look like some kind of spring chicken that will fall for this... badly scripted hypocrisy? Uh, Mommy, you actually look like a spring chicken. -[in Yoruba] What did you say? -No, it's a compliment. I will slap the black off your face, you silly little girl. How dare you? No, really, Akin. -[in Yoruba] Don't be upset. -Who the hell do you think you are? -What's wrong with you? -Who does she think she is? Rude child. -I didn't mean any-- -[Akin] Out! To the pool house. Now! I didn't mean any harm. And take off that damn costume. -[soothing sounds] -You look like a bloody masquerade. Calabar masquerade! -[soothing sounds] Let it be. -Mom, it's OK. She didn't mean it. You need to talk to your sister. She's really growing wings. Excuse me. I'll talk to her. Butterfly thinking she's an eagle. Who the hell does she think she is? I raised her. [Akin] Tokunboh... [sighs] [both laugh] No, but seriously, seriously, [in Yoruba] you can't disrespect your mother like that. Daddy, you know I didn't mean any harm. You know. You know how she is. -That woman. -She's coming. She's coming. Behind you. -[playful music playing] -Look, like I told you, if it was my mother, she would have slapped the taste out of your mouth. What nonsense. But you know, I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all. It's because I sent you to school abroad. I'm really sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry for what I did. I was highly disrespectful, and I won't do it again. I'm sorry, Ma. Please, I'm sorry. Go back inside the house, my friend. [Akin] Mope... Sweetheart, sorry. Honestly, it wasn't a set-up. Hm? But on a serious note... Huh? Your 50th cost one million dollars. Hm-mm? This is your 51st, it will be higher. Well, naturally. Huh? That means we're telling people to go and do what they bloody hell like. Akin, my husband, you are a Lagosian. I don't know if it's in the air or something in the water, but there is something about this city that makes you live on the edge. And no matter the trials or tribulations that come with it, we cannot fall, Akin. We can't. It's not possible now. You see, between you and I, my love, that is a wonderful pitch. But I can't sell it to AMCOM. They will show... and when they show, they will take over the company. And Baba Eko will not be there to help us. We are this close, this close, to losing St. Ives. And when we lose the company, what becomes of us? [sighs] OK, fine. Fine, Akin. Eko Hotel instead of dinner on the yacht. Our courtyard instead of Eko hotel. Low publicity instead of none at all. Private invite. No press. But we have to do Thanksgiving at the Church of Assumption now. [in Yoruba] This woman. [sighs] I will call Jagaban and see if he'll show. That's better, my little schmukum. [kissing sounds] [chuckling] [sighs] Akin... you say you have this under control. -Tell me the truth, Akin, are you? -[in Yoruba] God is my witness. -Absolutely. -[phone rings] [Grey] Well, not absolutely. [Akin laughs] This is new, you doubting me. Give me a reason not to, Akin. What strategy is in place? What plan? Remember... "Thou shalt not steal." What? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Your temerity is quite misplaced, my friend. Remember, I'm your CEO. Well, first, I'm your friend, Akin. The board members are not. They are investors who want their books in the black. Since you're tending towards red, the investors are meeting this morning to declare bankruptcy. [dramatic music playing] [Akin] We can't. We shouldn't. This is St. Ives Towers, for God's sake. You should have thought of that before. My father will turn in his grave. And if his turning cannot save us, -let him go ahead and spin. Who cares? -[woman] Thank you! Look, we have been very irresponsible with the fortunes of this company. [everyone talking together] Instead of planting our seeds, we ate them. Now the chicken has come home to roost. I say we file immediately. It is better to be seen as a laughingstock in the corporate world than for the banks to close in on us. -[woman 1] I concur. -[man 1] Hear, hear. -[woman 2] Yeah. -[man 2] Hear, hear. [man 3] I concur with what he said. Give me time. We can't give what we don't have. Besides, you have houses in [stutters] Fiji Islands, Mauritius, Spain. All over the world, and you're asking for time? -[indistinct speech] -The management retreat is next week. Look guys, I know we're living on the edge here, but I've done this long enough to know that at the eleventh hour there's always a miracle that turns the tide. -[everybody laughing] -[man] What is this man talking about? [man] What eleventh hour? Prayer warrior, well done. -[woman] Are you for real? -[Akin] Listen, guys... if nothing happens before the retreat... then we'll file for bankruptcy. [gentle music playing] [Kaima] Are you OK? [sighs] I thought I told you I could fix this. [softly] Come. [groans] [music intensifies] [upbeat music playing] Look, even Wedding Today did a center piece on us -for Mommy's birthday party thing. -I know, baby. And it's still the undisputed standard for fashion couple goals. We absolutely have to retain our spot. Uh-uh! You have to exceed it. [hysterical laugh] Your head is there. -Confession... -OK. -watching you and George at the party... -Hm-mm. ...made me want to get married. -Really? -Yeah, I mean, you looked so happy. [gasps] I wanted it so bad. -[shy laugh] OK, confession... -Hm-mm. [sighs] ...I am so blessed. I am so happy. Can't you see the smile on my face? I see it. Ah! Speaking of, I have to call him. I'll be right back. OK, baby. Hello, love, my sweetheart, my darling. [laughs] Hey. [clicks tongue] Baby, I miss you. I can't wait see you. I have so much planned for Mommy's birthday party. You are going to absolutely love it. Uhm, uhm... Excuse me. Mind if I call you back? I'm actually in the middle of something. Oh, come on, let me be a part of your day now. I miss the love of my life. I understand, but, uhm... [woman] Is that your wife? [somber music playing] Are... Are you not alone? I have to run, all right? I'll talk to you later. Bye. [hysterical laugh] Oh, my goodness. George is amazing, and once again, he has done it. He's planned a trip for us to go to the Seychelles. -[screams] You're so lucky. -[laughs] [Demidun] Oh! I'm so blessed. I'm so blessed. [indistinct talking] [upbeat music playing] You know the one I'm most looking forward to? Mrs. Savage's daughter's wedding. Now that will be something. Yours truly has gotten her VVIP invitation, complete with [laughs] a bracelet inside. [Dunni] Huh-uh. Baba Lihad, please. If it is not Pasuna, then I don't want any other person. -I wasn't the big boss of Fuji. -[indistinct speech] Please don't make excuses, and don't make me look like a liar in the presence of everybody. [in Yoruba] Get off the phone! My friends! [everyone talking together] [indistinct noises] [indistinct chattering] How does she always manage to sniff us out though? [upbeat music playing] [Dunni] Hey! Are you all right? Let me give you one gist. [in Yoruba] As the wife of Suraju the fish seller, AKA Ayinde, they want to give me the title "Fashionista of Oniru". [chuckles] Dunni, that's impossible. What's impossible? What's ridiculous? [in Yoruba] See, look at this. Tada! "Fashionista of Oniru". [Oge] Dreaming. What? What? [Oge] Dunni? This is a travesty. You people always think it's easy to be a fashionista. [in Yoruba] I have always been a fashionista. Anyway, let's leave that one aside. [in English] Let's leave that one, please come. What's this funny rumor I'm hearing about this, our friend, Mopelola? -That one. -Yes, I heard that... [stutters] [in Yoruba] How do you say this in English? [in English] Anyway, I heard that they are in a billion-dollar debts. No, it's billion naira, I heard. Listen, the bank is about to foreclose on St. Ives. [Ngozi] You're kidding me. Their househelp even told my househelp. So my househelp now told me that they have not paid them salaries... -for months. -I won't be surprised. -[indistinct speech] -Well, anyway. [laughs] Me, I cannot invite such people to my party. My party is not for the masses. -[laughs] -[indistinct speech] I repeat, my party is not for the masses. Only for people of your class. -Only for the people of my caliber. -I'm telling you. I'm telling you. [upbeat music playing] [Mopelola] My party must be unrivaled in the land of Eko partydom, and with even more splendor than my 50th. The big boys and the inner caucus of the Lagos elite, the custodians of Lagosian class, the one percent of the one percent. Frankly, anyone who hasn't received an invitation should sit back and reassess their reason for being on this planet in the first place. Now, is there anything you don't understand? Any questions? Mrs. Holloway... -Hm? -...I'm way ahead of you already. Very good. -Shall we begin? -Indeed. Now, I would like to use the courtyard. No, no, no. No, I'm thinking interior for this one. Oh? But is the space large enough? You mean, your palatial mansion? Of course it is. -I'm thinking Nigerian paradise. -[impressed exclamation] The gods of old. It's electric, Sango... And you... my beautiful goddess, will be Yemoja, coral everywhere. Oh... Mm... Let's see, what do we have here? Ah! I love this. Drums over here, greenery on the walls, and your family, my darling, -will fit right there. -[Mopelola] Hm... And over here... Mm... We will have the band. -Well, I was thinking-- -Apologies... Apologies, Mrs. Holloway, you can't interrupt it when the room is telling me what it wants to become. Hm... Oh! [hums] Blue. The ceilings, the walls, it's reminiscent of a tranquil environment. Something like a seaside that'll be sure to steal the show. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is my party. Nothing animate or inanimate -should steal the show. -[chuckling] -So therefore-- -And flowers... cascading down the walls, an orchid wall over here. Get Adela on the phone immediately. It's going to be... Think an Oyo and a Benin Empire merger. It's culture, it's spicy, but still... very classy. -I like that. -[Venya] Of course you do. So make sure all the decorators have all the information. I'll forward you the logistics of the event. And, uhm, should we be expecting an advance by check? Oh! Commence immediately. I'll be sending you the advance shortly. [chuckles] Yes, uh, yes, Ma, but, uhm... I just need a date to put on, just for the books. [scoffs] Am I sensing a recession in trust here, Venya? Since when? -[scoffs] -[Venya] Leave. [in Yoruba] Mother, Aunty Mopelola, huh-uh... [in English] But you know your boy is always loyal. [in Yoruba] But you know how the country is right now. [clicks tongue] Commence, Venya. If the word of Mopelola Holloway does not hold water, then frankly, I don't know why we're having this business discussion. Sorry, Aunty. I'll make the order right away. -Hm-mm. -And we'll make history, like we did last year. -Mm... I like the sound of that. -Of course, Ma. Uhm, but I have to be going. I'll see you next week. Oh, oh. One more thing. [clears throat] Not a word to the press. Not even one single picture on your Instagram page. Nothing. The preparations for the party this year are going to be very quiet. [stutters] Of course, in line with being exclusive. Hm-mm. Yes, Ma, I understand. I'm going to go now, OK? It's good to see you. Hm-mm. [sighs] Move! [lively music playing] [indistinct chattering] [in Yoruba] Mama... Mr. Holloway wants to see you. [Iya Oloja, in Yoruba] Let him come in... and leave us alone. [Akin inhales, in Yoruba] Good evening, Ma. Get up. Wash your hands and eat. [water splashes] [Akin] The governor... your son... [in English] he didn't answer my calls, and he didn't return any of my calls. [in Yoruba] We didn't vote the governor in to talk to people. [in English] He has the state to run. [in Yoruba] For God's sake, Ma. [in English] I need your help. [in Yoruba] The business is almost in ruins. For how long, Akin? You ran to Baba Eko. For five years... he persuaded your creditors to give you time. Now you want the governor's help. When are you going to grow into that man your father raised you to be? [in Yoruba] Look here... we all have problems. We won't leave ours to solve other people's problems. [Akin] Ma... [in Yoruba] My directors and I have a meeting this weekend. And we are going to discuss the whole time the progress of this company. Please help me. [in English] Just two years, I'll pay everybody that I owe. [in Yoruba] Please, for God's sake, help me. [in Yoruba] The Yorubas say, "A good name is better than gold and silver." Your name is important to me... so I will do something. [in Yoruba] Thank you, Ma. [in English] I love you. [Iya, in English] But... it won't end well for you. Huh? [in Yoruba] I'm not cursing you. You are like a child to me. [in English] But I need you to understand that you are your own problem. [in Yoruba] You need to wake up to your heritage. [in English] Otherwise... you stand the danger of losing it. [Akin] Mope, can you hear me? [Mopelola] Yes darling, I can hear you. I got the invoice for your party in the mail. Oh, he sent it. Good boy. [in Yoruba] The one who paid my bride price. You're the best. [stutters] Don't call me names. We agreed that this is a courtyard affair now. How can it get up to one million dollars? [scoffs] So we should disgrace the family, Akin, just because we decided to have the party on home ground? Mope, you don't understand. We are being watched. But I thought you said Iya Oloja had bought us a few more years. Irrespective. I can't afford it. So my day should be ruined? Huh-uh. Look, even me, myself, I'm not spending money or anything like that. I'm on a lean budget. I don't buy anything useless. -[salesman] Welcome, sir, to Mercedes-- -Shh. [in Yoruba] Sweetheart, for God's sake, let's manage what we have. One hundred million naira, that's all I'm going to do. [surprised gasp] Akin, that's too small now. Just make it half a million dollars. Half a million dollars is not nearly enough! One hundred and fifty million naira and not a penny more! [scoffs] Well, OK, OK. I'll manage it. Half-bread is better than none, I suppose. -[both in Yoruba] Bye. -Bye to you too. My brother... You're welcome, sir, to the Mercedes-Benz center. Yes. So, how is this car better than my old S-class? [salesman] Much better than the previous model. S-560. I mean, this is the S-560. Seventy-eight million, that's the best we can do, sir. -I'll take it. -Interestingly, sir, also... [Mopelola, in Yoruba] Give me the blue and white one. Hm-mm. Thank you. [scoffs] Iya Moruf. [Iya Oloja, in Yoruba] Oh, God. This one, fine. Go. Hm-mm. -You know, nothing beats Swiss lace. -Oh! [scoffs] Moruf. [gasps] I will be right with you. Oh! Oh, oh. [in Yoruba] What beats this one now? -With your skin tone, it is final! -[satisfied exclamations] [in English] In the whole Africa, -international worldwide market... -Mm? [in Yoruba] ...I am the only one that has it. -You're the only one that has it? -Ahaha! So that means I'll be the only one wearing it. -[in Yoruba] Only one. -I want it. -But wait, wait. Do you have it in white? -Hm? With those, uhm... the crystals they embellish them with. AB crystals. Me? Huh-uh. Me! Alhaja Sikirat Abeni, Mother of Moruf. Hold on. I will be back. I trust you. [chuckles] [Joy and Shaggy, in Yoruba] Greetings, Ma. [in Yoruba] Yes. What is it? -You're busy. We'll come back... -Speak. [in English] OK. Thank you, Ma. [in Yoruba] We don't mean to bother. We just thank you for everything. The Igbos say, "The bearer of kola nuts brings joy." -Not that we brought kola nuts but-- -[shushing] [in English] Is there a point to all this rambling? [in English] There is a point to the rambling. The way he talks. But Madam... [chuckles] He just doesn't know how to get to it. Madam, we... All of us, your workers, we love you, and we are entrapped. And we thought we shouldn't hide it from you, that we need our salaries to escape the bondage. How could you be so insensitive? Madam, we didn't bring any insecticide. Here I am, stressed out from organizing my 51st birthday party, and then you bring up the matter of your salaries. Well, it's fine. It's fine. If you choose to be oblivious to the fact that our monies are tied up in several business concerns... -[stutters] And... -[Joy] Madam, you are crying. -Madam, don't cry. -Madam, please don't cry. We decided not to treat you like we're... You are too emotional. -Madam. -One big... happy family. We are all one big family. [in Yoruba] You know I am emotional too. [Shaggy] How much is the money anyway? And then you cry... What am I supposed to say? How much is the salary? Madam, thank you. [in Yoruba] What do we need it for anyway? We can come back. What do you want... Yes, come back. Should I come and collect it this evening? [indistinct muttering] Iya Moruf, where is the--? -[Iya Oloja] Customer, this is it. -Oh! -Oh! -Ah... here it is! [in Yoruba] With the silvery head tie, not so? -I think so. -Are you doubting it? -[Joy] What kind of nonsense is that? -[Shaggy] Calm down. -[Joy, in Yoruba] I will tell them. -[Shaggy] Calm down. [in Yoruba] Everybody, come out. We are back from the meeting. Come out. I like that you have chosen me as your spokesperson. There's good news. I told madam in strong terms to give us our salaries. You understand me? I said-- I told Madam, "Madam, [stutters] where's the advance on our salaries? -Give us our salaries now!" -[everyone talking together] [in Yoruba] That's a lie. That's not what he did. He was scared of Madam. [man] Hm-mm? It is me who stayed there, and confronted her. I was the one that spoke up about salary. -[in English] Give us our money. -[all] Yes! That is when Madam entered the "rich also cry" tempo. She said, "You people put insecticide in my eye." [Shaggy, in Yoruba] It was the crying that disarmed me. [Joy] He pitied madam and started crying. What? If you had seen it, you would have cried too. [playful music playing] [in Yoruba] I am tired! [in English] I need my salary. [all speaking together] [in Yoruba] And anything I can't get physically, I'll get spiritually. [in English] And I want to pray. If you want to join me, hold hands. [Joy] You will say after me, "Oh Lord." [everyone] Oluwa. -Oh Lord. -[together] Oluwa. What is the Oluwa you're saying? What? Oluwa and Oh Lord, don't they mean the same thing? Is God Yoruba? He doesn't understand Yoruba! [light music playing] -[in Yoruba] I love it. -You do? -[in Yoruba] I love it. -[giggling] I knew that hiring you would be the best decision of my life. [shrieks] I was so nervous, Nnamdi. -About this? -Yes. No! See this, your story? My mother will enjoy it. It's also something that my brothers in Alaba and Idumota will enjoy. I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am. Relieve yourself. You have done very well. Uhm, but... Your soup... -it is sweet already. -Hm... But there is a small ingredient that we'll just add, you know, to... to... to thicken the plot. All right, I'll put that in mind when I'm doing the outline. [stutters] But I have some ideas that I want to pour. OK, I'm all ears. Go on, let me take notes. Good. -You see this, your king here, King Agwu? -Yes. -Let us make him have two sons. -Fantastic. -Very irresponsible idiots... -I love that. -...Aki and Pawpaw. -What? Oh yes, then let us find something for Mr. Ibu. Maybe, village palm wine tapper. Then we'll find, uhm... Mama G. We can make Mama G a perpetual beggar. By the time we add all these people inside this soup... [in Yoruba] Woman. It is World Bank that'll be calling us to give us money. [silly noises] Wait, Nnamdi, you are not joking? No. You don't like my idea? Look, Nnamdi, I am glad that I am working with you, and I'm stoked that I'm about -to do something great, -Ah-ha... but pardon me if I say that these, your ideas... there's no... there's no nice way to put it. Put it how it's doing you in your heart. They are crap. -Huh? -Yes! Do you know these people that you are talking about? -Hm-mm. -Ibu? Ozokwo? Aki and Pawpaw? These are juggernauts of the east. Movers and shakers of Asaba. But not for this movie. But this is their kind of movie now. Powerful epic. -Blockbuster-- -No! This is a revenge thriller. Not a slapstick with village actors. By the time these guys go in that is exactly what it's going to become. Woman, we need to put to comedy. People need to laugh. The country is hard. [in Yoruba] Things are hard in this country. It needs an element of comedy. It should not become comedy. [Nnamdi sighs] Toku... I can hear you. I see where we have our difference. -It's very clear. -Hm... You want to win [stutters] an Oscar. -Of course. -Me, I just want to pack money. Money! It is very clear to me that there is a conflict of interest here. Maybe another writer will accept your terms. But not me. Toku, you don't want to write my blockbuster? It is no longer a blockbuster. This is a joke that every critic will tear down. I, Tokunboh Holloway, will not be associated with such. -You will get a text shortly. -What do you want to say? Not from me... from your bank, alerting you that I have returned your advance. Toku... But you have been advanced, Venya. Only a quarter of the fees, Mrs. Holloway, and now we are dipping into the company purse. Empty the purse if you have to. But never insinuate a lack of faith in being squared for your services. Nothing of the sort, Mrs. Holloway, but if the flowers are going to be here on time, we need to fly them in express. We still have not settled on the caterer, the ushers, the band, even the last bits of décor. I mean, all due respect, Mrs. Holloway, but any concessions I could make, given your standing, I can't make anymore because there is no media. Everything is hush. I'm afraid we cannot commence without adequate remuneration, Ma. I'll send you a check, Venya. Ma, it's Saturday. So? So, I can't cash the check. Do you think you can make a transfer, Ma? [grunts] Send me your account details. I'll have my husband do a transfer to you. [clicks tongue] Sure thing. [sighs] I hate... broke people. -[dog barking in distance] -[gloomy music playing] [phone beeps] [phone beeps] TOKU? PLEASE -[laid-back piano music playing] -[car horns honking] [sighs] Akin, I am tired. You know what I say about things like this, Kaima. I am not leaving him. One second. [watch dealer] Excuse me, sir, this is a Rolex Day Date, president bracelet, ever rose gold, chocolate dial. I'm a Holloway. I want something more limited edition. Do you have anything Cartier? Yes, of course. We have a Cartier, uhm, Diamond, which is dragon dial on an alligator leather strap. Oh, fantastic. I'll have that one. OK. Thank you, sir. Are you buying a watch? Aren't you supposed to be piping down to avoid AMCON snipers? We have two to three years. But isn't that what got you there in the first place? Look, Kaima, will you call me when this sanctimonious spell passes? No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I want to see you. Kaima, you know what? Why don't you take some days off, get a room at, uh, Wheatbaker, full-service luxury? I got you some diamonds from Pierre. Fantastic diamonds, I'm sure you'll like them. So, Sunday night it is? And then we can resume your nifty bedroom-- What did you call it? You know, for a stiff upper lip, you, my darling, are the sweetest man on earth. Goodnight, Kaima. [upbeat music playing] Look at, uh, these people here, huh? Look at them. What are they watching? Old, young. My tribe, your tribe. [in Yoruba] Muslim, Christian, everyone. [in English] That is my market. I like your idea. Don't get me wrong. But let us not forget that, uh, this is Nigeria. We are still Nigerians. So, if you don't like my idea, [in Yoruba] then refine it with your magic... [in English] and make it sweet. I want all these people here to come to the cinema to watch our film. And if these people don't come to the cinema, the movie will find... [indistinct speech] its way to this TV. [in Igbo] Please, dear. [in Yoruba] Toku please, [in English] help me to make this film. Toku, I'm too young to be sent back to the village. No girl will want to marry a failed Nollywood marketer. -[chuckles] -Please, help me. [in Yoruba] OK. So, what you are saying to me is that you want me to compromise? Is that not what every good relationship is about, huh? Compromise. It is. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. You see these people here... this one is oil. Oil! [chuckles] Mass market. Do you like the food? [sighs] [dishes clinks] [Demidun] Babe, I'm sorry. Honey, let's just go back to the way things used to be. Please. [somber music playing] -No! I can't do this. -Please. [Demidun] Please. Please... -[knock on door] -[Mopelola] Yes? [door clicks open] -Good morning, Ma. Mrs. Oge Briggs-- -Yes? -[Oge] Mopelola, my darling. -[women laughing] Oh, Kiki! [smacks lips] Oge, what a pleasant surprise! [Oge] We just came to commiserate with you, my darling. -[Kiki] Yes! -Over? Your family's financial woes, of course. But we have no financial situation, Oge. -Mope... -[Mopelola] Hm? -You're a very strong woman. -[Oge] Hm-mm. You're taking your financial situation to heart. Look at you, you've become prudent. Yes. You're wearing Ituen Basi of three seasons ago. Well, I enjoy retro as much as I do the current fashion trends. [women chuckling] Well, for something to be considered retro, -ten years should have passed. -[Oge] At least. Yes, anything less and you're just plain broke. I beg your pardon! [Kiki] I'm not saying that you're broke. I'm not saying you're broke. I'm simply saying that Proverbs 22 verse 3 suits you. Yes, yes, the one about the prudent... -[Kiki] Yes. -Yeah. The prudent see danger, and they take cover. -Oh, really? -[Kiki] Yes. Well, [clears throat] let me see. Proverbs 26 verses 23 to 25 suits you perfectly, darling Kiki. -[Kiki] Hey? What does that say? -[Mopelola] Yes... A smooth tongue may hide a wicked heart [chuckles] as the glaze covers a clay pot. [women laugh] Hm... But anyway, what brings you here? In fact, Kiki, I called you a few weeks ago. You never picked up my calls. Yes, we were on a trip. We were on a trip. You know, this Lagos weather, the heat, everything was just getting... was getting to me, so we took a ski vacation in Aspen. [Mopelola] Oh, how lovely. -We traveled as well. -[Mopelola] Oh, really? Yes, we did New York, and then we did California. Sorry we didn't tell you, but we completely avoided you know where? -Atlanta. -[Mopelola] Oh? All the Nigerians... -[Mopelola] Oh! -...teeming, coming out like... Yes, like roaches everywhere. -[Kiki laughs] -Yes, they're everywhere, aren't they? But, uhm, Mopelola, you weren't able to travel, were you? Oh, well. [clears throat] Uh, the family... are currently going through a rediscovering Nigeria phase. -[Oge] Tell us. -[Mopelola stutters] Our country is so big and beautiful. It is. That is a fact. And it's amazing how much we don't know about it. -True, true. -Besides, "Buy Nigeria and grow the naira," -is what we say. -[Kiki laughs] Oh, yes! -[Mopelola] Yes, yes. -So it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the travel agent has just blacklisted you -for unpaid bills? -[clears throat] [Kiki] Are you ok? Well, I'm sure you ladies must have -something you need to attend to... -Mm... -[speaking together] -So let me see you out. -[indistinct muttering] -Thank you so much for stopping by. Don't forget. Don't be a stranger. No, of course. But I will... Yes... -Do keep in... Keep in touch. -[women laugh] -[Mopelola] Kiss the babies for me. -[Kiki] Yes, we will. [Mopelola] The drivers are in the.. -[Kiki] That they are. -[Mopelola] OK... [Mopelola] So you take care now. [together] We will. Bye. -Bye-bye. Bye! -[women laugh] [fake laugh, sighs] [scoffs] Fluttering witches. [upbeat music playing] [singing in Yoruba] [Oge] Biko, what is happening to your people? [Biko scoffs] There was a time when the title, -we waited to hear who got it. -Hm-mm. And it always went to, you know, women with sophistication and panache. If your husband is a man that controls the grassroots votes of the entire South-West, [chuckles] and you have crooked teeth, one leg, you're considered a woman of panache and sophistication [chuckles]. [Ngozi] Well, true. [Oge] What is happening with her? [chuckles] Is she having a party, or isn't she? I heard she's doing it low-key. Hm-mm. Low-key? She doesn't do anything low-key. -Its either loud or nothing at all. -[Kiki] Exactly. Maybe they're being careful because me, I'm yet to receive my own invitation. Then, I don't think she's doing it. -[groans] Or maybe she's not inviting us. -No! That's not possible. Excuse you. Who will throw a party in Lagos and not invite Ngozi Gomez? -[woman scoffs] -Have you thought about it? [scoffs] Well, I heard, from Mope, that, uh, your husband's extended trip in the US is not a business one. And that's what I heard. She said that she heard that he's in prison... for drug trafficking. So maybe she is socially blacklisting you. But I did not believe. I did not believe. When I-- Huh-uh. What nonsense is that? -[stutters] Hm-mm. -[Ngozi] Huh? [chuckles] See wickedness. Hey! Tunde, that is on contract with HSBC? Exactly. In fact, why am I having this conversation with the two of you people? This is nonsense. -I said it. -Exactly. Yes, we said it. I said it. I said it. I said it. -So it's true. -[laughs] But you know what? She's not the one I'm concerned about at all. It's Mope. -And I know just how to find out. -Hm? You are at it again! So all this "gra-gra" and everything. It's true. He's in prison. I'm at a party with my wife. I'll call you back. All right. -Huh-uh! -Akin! [in Yoruba] Grey, Grey. How are you? You have gotten here too? We are birds of the same feather. [Akin] Ah! Your beautiful wife. -[Akin] How are you? -[sighs] Good evening, Uncle Akin. [Akin] How are you? [in Yoruba] I hope you haven't forgotten us. Ah! Why would you say that? Look, I tell you what: choose a date and a place, OK? I will be there. As long as that your dangerous Banga soup is there, I will be there too. Not a problem. But for now, let me go and join my seniors on the dance floor. [Akin] All right now. All right. You're a very lucky man. -Whoo-hoo! -Very, very. [chuckles] Very. Chief Olisa, he wants to see us. He's waiting for us in the office. -Really? -Yes. There is something he has to discuss with us. [Akin] Where is my wife? Let's go. I will call her. [door clicks open] Hope all is well? [male member] There is no easy way to say this. The bank has finally transferred your debts to Asset Management. What? -[gloomy music playing] -We'll have to foreclose on St. Ives. [female member] Surely there's something that we can do? The governor intervened. I have two years lifeline. We got an email, tracking your expenses for the past six years on company funds. Digital receipts of trips to... to Dubai, to Milan, Fiji Island, Mauritius. All on chartered flights, multiple times in a year. Homes in Asokoro, in Spain, in London. [softly] Did you know about this? [male member] Fleets of Maybachs, Rolls Royce, Bentleys. I don't need to continue. You know what you've been up to with money. And so does the governor... because he was copied in the mail. And he's not going to protect you to the detriment of his political career. Who sent that mail? Who did this? [chief] Does that matter? Look, we don't know. So you're selling St. Ives? We inherited your debt, -and we have to pay. -No! So we'll be breaking down the company and selling its parts. You know I've always been a loyal insider, and I did all I could to stave this off. But if that mail leaks, everyone that protects you will be tarnished. I'm sorry. -[door slams shut] -Uh, thank you. [Grey] I'll get you something strong, sorry. [music continues] Dunni Fernandez, Iya Oge, of Oniru. -Thank you! -[crowd clapping] Royalty has never looked so exquisite on the female species. [in Yoruba] Of course, thank you. [Oge] But while we celebrate, we must remember those in our midst who have little or nothing to celebrate. -[dramatic music playing] -Mopelola... Holloway, my dearest, dearest friend. This time last year, you know, you, you gave us a 50th birthday to remember, and now, you can't even produce your promised 51st. You know, whether it's this AMCON takeover, or the rumors about the dire financial straits your husband's company is in, St. Ives, whatever it is, my sister, whatever it is, I stand with you all the way. [inhales] But this is not the place for us to discuss that. -Please, let us encourage her. -[applause] -It's a prayer point, cheers. -[women] Cheers. [woman] Cheers, everybody. It's a prayer point, cheers. [woman] Cheers. It's a prayer point. I've lost everything. The Holloway name is finally done for. Not if you buy back the firm. St. Ives is for sale. We can buy back our company. That will be insider trading. Only if we're caught. We set up firms to buy each of these, and we bid for them independently. Call in favors. Milk your network, Akin. [sighs] Still won't be enough. Oh! Then you may need to dip into your coffers. Treasury bills, jewelry, fixed deposits, even the children's trust funds. Oh no, I can't do that. [sarcastic laugh] Can you lose St. Ives? [Akin] Now, not only was there the risk of acting illegally, I was gambling my whole fortune... on winning back my company. Failure would mean I would lose everything. And when you really need help, this is when you find out who your real friends are. My family had no idea what I was doing. ["Waka Waka" by Brymo playing] [inaudible talking] [Oge] Angela, I think the larger orchid would be nicer here. Yes, that one. That's much better. Thank you. [Mopelola] Oge Briggs! -I'm going to deal with you with you-- -[Oge] Hello, my darling. No, no, no! Don't patronize me, you over bleached heifer. -Bleached? -Do you really think you can embarrass me in public and get away with it? -What are you talking about? -You really think so? What exactly were you trying to do at Dunni's party? -Dunni's party? -Your ridiculous attempt to embarrass me? -You cannot be me, Oge. Give it up. -Who is trying to be you, you... You can't get the kind of attention I have. ...you tattooed bitch? -Tattooed bitch? -Yes. Better to be a tattooed bitch than a glorified prostitute, Oge. Who are you calling a prostitute? Oh! Have you forgotten your glory days of Asaba? -Asaba? -Oh, I have evidence. Chief Agbaje, video tape, Italy. [tutting sounds] Two can play the game, Oge. Let me remind you: my name is Mopelola Holloway, and I play to win. You started it. I am going to finish it. Now shift. Gutter snipe. You come in from your little swamp, and you think you can come to my Eko and take over. I will deal with you in Eko. Bitch. Heifer. Runt. [Tokunboh] Ada stood over his dead body, her knife still in his chest. She had finally avenged King Agwu, her murdered father. But she began to feel woozy. The poison from her knife wound was taking its course. She stumbled through the forest, losing strength, almost falling. Did she die? [in Yoruba] Can you be quiet? Let her finish. You remember the herbalist's kola nuts? Uh... The cure to every poison that she told Ike to throw in the stream. [Tokunboh] That was the stream he threw it in. But this is somehow... Beautiful story. -Now you are talking. Beautiful story! -[man makes silly noises] -[man makes silly sounds] -My brothers... I can see the way you are smiling from ear to ear. That you thoroughly loved what the young lady has said. [man] Beautiful story. [in Igbo] As the people overseas say, [in English] "This is just the tip of the iceberg." [men laugh] [Nnamdi] What we want to do is to shock people. [everyone laughs] This is going to be a cinema blockbuster. Hm... Uh... OK! [stutters] All we just need is just a token. [in Igbo] A little amount. Uh, 50 million naira, only. -[man giggles] -Fifty what? [in Yoruba] Did you hear what I just heard? -[man make silly noise] -[man, language] What you are saying... is that shooting a good film costs 50 million? It's cinema. Big picture. But this is not a glamour film. It's not a film where you will see somebody taking their girlfriend to London and Paris in a private jet to go, go and enjoy. Like a man living large. [in English] If I call Anayo Phillip, [in Yoruba] he will do it for five million. -2.5. -1.5. [man, in Igbo] You see, when he finishes with this film, even Hollywood would call us and say, "Please, how did you do it?" Don't misunderstand us. -This is a good Asaba thriller... -[man] Hm-mm! that we can have season 1, season 2, season 3, season 4 and 5. I cannot drop my one kobo of my hard-earned money because you want to do cinema. [man] Fifty? Nah! [indistinct talking] [silly sound] At what point do you get really mad at me and call me names? Nnamdi, no. Don't even spare me. Say how you feel. My mother, she's giving me grief over my dress sense. Then my dress for the party is horrible. And to make matters worse, I am bringing my bad luck your way. Huh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. Toku, in business, there is no luck. Sometimes you gain; sometimes you lose. That is business. And tell your mother to leave my Toku for me the way I love her. [exclaims] I remember the first day you walked into my office. I said, "My God! Who is this lady glowing like the sun?" [bright music playing] Whatever that means, thank you. And I love you. No, look... [stutters] I only said it because you said it twice. When we were going to see your investors, and then a few minutes ago. Why are you afraid? If I say I love you... then I love you. [feel-good music playing] [Venya] OK, you know what to do. I told you, move that already. What are you doing? Chair! [clapping] Come on, guys. I don't have all day. [Mopelola] Be careful with that vase, young man. [Venya] Don't waste my time. Do not waste my time. Come on. Right there, move, move, move. -[gentle music playing] -Hm... Beautiful day, isn't it, darling? Uh, yes, Mom. [in Yoruba] Uhm... What about George? Uhm... It's a busy season, so you know, he's always in the skies. So he might not be able to make it to the party? [sighs] Demidun, when I first met your father, he was a man of the world. There was money to blow; women loved him. The Holloway name stood strong behind him, but he would have had no future if I hadn't intervened. The devil with all his vials did not go to Adam. He would have failed. He went to the one thing that he knows a man cannot resist... his wife. Take control of your husband, Demidun. Set him straight. Hm? And stop crying. No man is worth it. Now chin up. That's my girl. Hm? Oh, and talk to you little sister. Convince her not to wear that... thing -that she wants to wear for my party. -[phone rings] Uh, I'll talk to her, Mom, but I think she-- Hm-mm. Hm-mm. Hello, Bunmi, I was just about to-- [unsettling music playing] What? You mean, right now? Demidun! Demidun, oh, Demidun! [Mopelola sighs] [TV reporter] This is ABC news. Mr. Akin, what happened to your company? Why is the company being taken away from you? [Akin] Excuse me! -[reporter] What happened? -[indistinct talking] -[Akin] Grey, what's all this? -[Grey] Akin, calm down, calm down. The director is in the office. [reporter] Mr. Holloway, why is the company being taken away from you? [tense music playing] This is my stuff. Mr. Director... Did you attempt to purchase shares from your company using bogus fronts? No! We're no longer selling St. Ives. She will be absorbed in an initial public offer. [Akin] What? Mr. Director... [sighs] [horns honking] -From Holloway to No Way! -[women giggling] I told you: pride, ladies, comes before a fall. -[gasps] I'm not laughing. -Don't laugh. Me, I'm not laughing. I'm crying. Give me my laptop. You see? You see what I'm talking about. [in Yoruba] Has it not happened? The internet is going to catch fire. [in Yoruba] Uh-huh. Ngozi, you send a gossip on an errand, and she won't deliver? I have heard. The whole world will hear! Where is this child? Come and give me a massage... and punch my body. -[phone beeps] [Demidun panting] -Oh my God! -[tense music playing] Hold on, babe. [indistinct talking] [in English] Oh my God! [in Yoruba] This guy will kill me today! -[horns honking] -[somber music playing] Who did this? [clears throat] Who did this to me? Who could have done this? -[tense music playing] -Who did this? [Grey chuckles] Almighty Akin Holloway, I was behind it all. Everything, Akin. I orchestrated everything. Everything. From the insider trading, the AMCON takeover, to all the deals. I was behind it all. I set it all up. [Grey] You fool! What is the 10th commandment, Akin? [Akin] Seriously? The 10th commandment, Akin, what is it? Something about, uh... [Grey] "Thou shalt not covet your neighbor's wife." Did you honestly think that I was so dumb that I didn't notice the damn of you? The smell of your cigar on her clothes? Akin, I've been with you! I've stood with you! I stuck with you! I walked with you! Akin, you had everything! Everything, Akin! That one thing that was mine, you had to have it! My wife! In your bed! Get up! Now you stand... before your new chairman. [inaudible] Get out. Get out! Filth!

It's because you're upset. Mopelola. Don't speak. [phone rings] Hello? Akin. Mama, you weren't wrong. I ruined everything. I destroyed the family legacy. All the terrible things to catch up with me. Ma, I don't deserve to live. You probably don't. Huh? [in Yoruba] Yeah. Since you are crying like a child, [in English] if that is your reaction to the issue. But Mama, destroy the family name, I have brought it to the ground. Yeah? And if we crash to the ground, do we sink into the earth like water? No Mama. We rise. [bright music playing] We rise, Mama. [in Yoruba] Hm-mm. I will find something for you. [in English] Just good enough to start all over. No, no, no, no, no, Mama. You were right in the first place. I didn't take these things seriously because they dropped in my lap. Now, I'm going to go for mine. Hm? Comforting to hear you sound just like your father. But... Mama, I need you to do something for me. [mom] Hm-mm? For Mope, actually. [scoffs, in Yoruba] I am listening. [indistinct talking] Demidun, Tokunboh, for everything, I'm truly sorry. Gentlemen, gentlemen, please stay. Please stay. Please. I've brought this upon this family. But it's my wife's birthday. She wanted to have a good birthday party. And I intend to give her one, with your help, of course. With our help? But will people still come with what's on ground? People, we're the Holloways. That's all that matters. Dad, you know what? Me and Demidun have the best idea ever. We do? [inaudible] -Uh... Daddy, just leave it to us. -Yup. [Akin] Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you. [knock on door] [gentle music playing] [Tokunboh] No, no. Mommy! [soothing sounds] Are you all right, Mommy? Your father has finished us. [sighs] Mom, to answer your question: you asked what was wrong with us. I know that Dad may have done bad by us, and I'm not exactly what you want me to be, and you find a way to always remind us of how imperfect we are. -That's only because I-- -Mom... -Mom, we know. -We do. We know that you love us. We do. Yes, we may have lost St. Ives... but we didn't lose us. [scoffs] And, Mom, it's only us -that'll get us out of this. -Exactly. -Oh, my darlings, I'm so sorry. -[indistinct talking] I'm so sorry. I love you both so, so very much, my darlings.
