** (man) The year is 1933 and depression ravages our great land. These were the dark years when the people lost everything. Crops failed, soil turned bad, and a lot of folks just up and moved away. They'd lost their homes, their money, their pride. They didn't have much to believe in. They couldn't take back what was theirs. But they could admire those who tried. So, by 1933, a new breed of folk heroes emerged. The spiritual descendants of Jesse James and Billy the Kid. They broke the law and people watched and said, "Ain't that boy got nerve?" There was Pretty Boy Floyd from Oklahoma, Ma Barker and her boys from Missouri, Bonnie and Clyde Barrow from Texas, Wilbur Underhill, the Tri-state Terror. There was Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Homer Van Meter, Alvin Karpis, and Machine Gun Kelly. ** (Purvis) George R. Kelly, age 35. Born in Tennessee. Braggart, ex-convict. A spineless, small-time bootlegger from Memphis whose fearsome reputation was carefully built and nurtured by the woman he loved-- Kathryn Elizabeth Ryan. Age 28. Born Longview, Texas. Involved in transport of illegal whiskey, counterfeiting, and prostitution. The cool-nerved lady who taught Big George how to handle a Thompson. Charles Leonard Parlmetter. Age 32. Born Tuskegee, Oklahoma. A wheel man for the O'Connor Gang in Nebraska. Wounded left leg, Omaha, 1931. A punk, a psychopath. (dog barking) Get it open! Come here! Where's the money? No money. Come on, George. (men shouting) What's going on? Oh, the bank hasn't got any money. They're flat busted. Get on in there and get him out of there then. What a time to be robbin' banks. Whole country's gone to the dogs. Oh, come on, get out of here! What are you doing? Let's go. I ain't finished, Charlie. Let's get out of here. (Kathryn) George! Did you hear that, honey? There ain't no money in this bank. You can't trust anybody. Get in here! I'm really depressed, but wait a minute. I'm gonna leave them something just so they'll remember we were down here anyway. George, you're nut, you're nuts. Get in here! Come on, George! No! (both shouting) George, get in here, get in here! Oh, no. (siren blaring) Here we go. (Purvis) This was their third dry bank in a month. So Kate Ryan formed a new plan. She was gonna step her man up in class. Any men at the top ten most wanted or know the reason why. Well, that's a bad mistake. 'Cause it brought me into it. Me, Melvin Purvis. Hello, George. How are you, Buckwheat? Nice to see you again. Miss Kate, how you been? Good to see you, too. Some hotshot middle man you are, kid. You're late. Ay, Charlie. Ay, Gene, how are ya, boy? I'm fine. Okay, everybody, let's get going. You ready, Redecci? (all talking at once) (Purvis) Thomas "Buckwheat" Longaker. Age 22. Born Bridgewater, Arkansas. A petty criminal, escaped convict. Anthony "Tony" Redecci. Age 33. Born in the Bronx. Convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in Detroit, 1926. On parole. Eugene T. Farber, age 35. Born Hartford, Connecticut. Forger, con man, blackmailer. (woman laughs) (crowd laughing) (party chatter) ** (party chatter and laughter) ** (pots clanging) All right, move it back! Everybody, quiet! All right, get 'em in the icebox here. Come on, come on, hurry it up. All right, bye-bye. Okay. All right, now, uh, you three guys, you go around the back. We'll give you five minutes. We'll go in from this side. We'll wait for you here. Go on, go on. ** Oh, come on, Nash. Cheer up. Don't look so bored. I'm usually bored at your parties. This one is no exception. (gunshots) Oh, my God, they're shooting at me. (woman screaming) All right, your attention, please. Now quiet down, everybody. What do you want? Who are you people? (women screaming) Be calm, be calm. (women shrieking) Hands up, put your hands up. Take it easy. (woman sobbing) Uh-huh. (gasps) Give them whatever they want. He's what we want. (gasping) Come on, keep moving. Get down there. All right, everybody down on your bellies. I said down! George, you damn fool. You could've hit me then. (George) Hey, Buckwheat, you got the blindfold? Oh, yeah, George. How about getting it on this guy so we can get out of here? All right, come on, everybody, now let's get going. (indistinct shouting) Get your gun. Like to thank you all for a real nice party. (women shrieking) So long now. ** Let's go. Come on. Come on. Get moving. Get in. Charlie, you drive? Get in. (car sputtering) Oh. What's a matter with it? (Charlie) Where'd you get this car? What's wrong? Where you going? Won't start. What's a matter with it? What's a matter with it? Hit the starter. Ryan, I'm cold, let's go, Charlie. I'm trying. I'm trying to start it! (car sputtering) Where the hell you going, Buckwheat? Hey, this one's got the key. This has got the keys in it. Move over. No, it's on this side. It's on the right? Yeah. Hey, Gene, grab my gun. (car starts) (engine revving) Ain't this a beauty, Gene? This is a Rolls-Royce. You sure you know how to work one of these, Charlie? I can work anything. You sure now? You bet I can. ** (brakes screeching) Everything looks all right, Mr. Purvis. (man) Hello, Mr. Purvis. Mr. Purvis, Lincoln from "The Times." Is it true you're handling this case personally? What is says in the papers, sonny? Congratulations on the other no-killing, Mr. Purvis. Killing, you make it sound like I had a choice. Is it true John Dillinger calls you on the telephone? We've talked, yes. He called late last week from Indiana, I believe. Will you have a statement to make for the kidnappings, sir? I never make a statement I can't back up, but we'll have Covington back in time for his winter clues. Now if you gentlemen will excuse us, we've got a few rats to catch. Those reporters, ah, I'll tell ya. I'm forced to say they're important, Sam. They're important to you, me, Mr. Hoover. People need heroes. Better they make heroes out of us than out of John Dillinger or his kind. (clock ticking) My, my, my. Made a terrible shambles out of it, didn't they? Yes, sir. (clock continues ticking) I'll say one thing for Mr. Covington, he knows how to spend his money. Betcha they don't come up with anything in here either. Put your hand in that bucket a minute. You're cold? Yes, sir. How about pouring me and Sam a glass? We haven't brushed those for prints yet. I didn't get your name. Name is Purvis, Melvin Purvis. I rather doubt that the outlaws would stop whatever they were doing long enough to have a glass of champagne. Now maybe you can tell me what else was taken besides Mr. Covington himself. Yes, well, we're-- we're not entirely, uh-- (Nash) I can answer that question, Mr. Purvis. I'm Thatcher's brother, Nash Covington. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Covington. Meet Sam Cowley. Sir. My Rolls-Royce was taken. In trade, they left an old Franklin sedan with a faulty ignition. Oh, we've put out a roadblock on them. Good, my Rolls should be easy to spot. Should be. Probably out of the state by this time, however. Sam, put out a reward bulletin on it. Make it a big one. Yes, sir, but don't you think they probably would've gotten rid of it by now? Possibly. But I doubt it. They aren't exactly big-time crooks. These are punks, petty thieves. It's possibly the biggest job they've ever pulled in their life. Highly probable that they're gonna want to keep a souvenir from it. And very possibly, it'll be your Rolls-Royce. ** (dog barking) (Kate) George? Huh? I said I'm freezing to death in there. Well, hey, this here Rolls has a heater. We can turn on the engine. We can get inside there-- Huh-uh, no way, George. This car is low on gas. Can't waste none. I don't know where the next station is. (cow mooing) Yeah, well, look, I tell you, son, we're gonna get rid of this stinkin' car anyway. You know? I mean, it ain't no good for nothing, sticks out like a sore thumb. No, we ain't gonna get rid of this baby. You know what the trouble is with you, Charlie? Trouble with you is you're stupid. What did you say? I said the trouble with you, Charlie, is you're stupid. (door closes) You're calling me stupid? Yeah. (Kate) Hey, Charlie, don't push him, huh? He can kill you just like that. Stupid, huh? Nobody calling me stupid. I'll give you some stupid. (Gene) Charlie, Charlie! Charlie, Charlie, Charlie! (Kate) Hey, hey! (Gene) Take it easy, Charlie. Easy. I'm easy, Gene. (dog barking) I'm easy. I'm an easy sort of fella. Well, that's more like it, Charlie. At it already. No honor among thieves. I could've said that right at the beginning. Shut up. (Covington) Scrapping away at each other. Ripping each other apart like a band of-- Ay, Georgy, now he knows who we are. (Charlie) Talk about stupid. Don't flatter yourselves. I haven't the vaguest idea who you are. Should I know you? Yeah, you should know us because we just happen to be the Kelly Gang. What are you telling him that for, honey? Come on. We don't want the Barrows getting all the publicity, do we? Besides that, he doesn't know where we're taking him, do you? Ain't she smart? Ain't she something? Come here, baby. (Kate) You like that, Georgy? Yeah, I like it. (giggles) You like that, huh, Georgy? Yeah, I like it. (giggles) Uh, hey, look y'all, I'm freezin'. What say we be going, huh? Hey, Buckwheat, I'm the one around here says "let's be going," not you. Oh, yeah, sure, George. I'm sorry. (bird chirping) Well, let's be going. Let's go! Hey, Charlie, that car ain't going nowhere. It's staying here. The hell it does. Charlie, come on. You know he's right. Be reasonable. Reasonable? What's reasonable about him wanting to take my car? You take that car and you ain't going with us. That's right. Well, that's fine with me. I'll see you in Oklahoma. Wrong side. Come on, Gene, get in the car. You gotta get in the right door, Charlie. Go on, Gene, get in the car, help him out. Help him drive the car. I don't think we should start splitting up now. What about our shares? What's a matter, don't you trust us? I didn't say that, but I-- Well, what are you saying then? Hey, Gene, don't say nothing, all right? Just get in the car and get out of here. Come on, Gene, don't argue with him. Get in the car! Okay, okay, okay. (car sputtering) (car starts) Oklahoma. Okay. We'll see you there. Okay. Get out of the way before I run you down! (horn honking) ** Get outta here! ** (boys shouting indistinctly) (man) Get outta here, kid. Out! Go on, beat it. (horn honking) You want me to bring you one? (man) Yeah, yeah. (horn honking) What the hell are you doing? You near killed me! (laughter) And what's so funny? That's what's funny, boy. Buck! How's it going, J.D.? What are you doing here? Are you crazy? You still a fighter? I can still handle you. Are you crazy? I can handle you. I can still handle you. Yow! Pa? Buckwheat? You lookin' good, Pa. How you been keeping, huh? Just fine, son. Who are your friends? Oh, this here's the Kelly Gang, Pa. Howdy, Mr. Longaker. I'm Kate. This here's George, George "Machine Gun" Kelly. (mimics machine gun) (laughter) Works better than my machine gun. Glad to know you, Mr. Longaker. You got a fine boy here. He's real fine, real fine. Oh, and that there's Anthony Redecci. Hello, Pop. Mr. Kelly, I sure am proud to meet you. I'm J.D., Buckwheat's brother. Well, J.D., I'm sure proud to meet you, too. Pa, that there's that rich millionaire fella, Mr. Thatcher Covington. Yeah? Hey, we read all about that in the newspaper. So y'all the ones that snatched him. Yeah, sure enough. That's pretty good, son. Say, you folks must be hungry. Come on inside. We got plenty of food and cold beer. (Buckwheat) Oh, boy, I'm glad to hear that. All right, what do you think of that shot, huh? Sure appreciate your hospitality. (all talking at once) (men shouting indistinctly) Hey, how you doing? Give me a kiss, girl. Mwah. Uh, you think, uh, you think they got that letter? Sure, they got the letter. (bartender) Here you are, Mr. Kelly. Thanks very much. Now all they gotta do is put that ad in the paper and agree to leave us the money. Ought to be in by tomorrow. Well, I hope so. I'm gonna propose a toast here. To Franklin Delano Roosevelt and $500,000. (all cheering) $500,000. How much did they have to pay in that harem kidnapping? $200,000. Well, I won't pay a dime more. Then they'll probably kill your brother. Mr. Purvis, could we be alone? You boys wait outside. Not you, Sam. Anything you got to say to me, you can say it in front of Sam here. Very well. But this is rather delicate. (clears throat) To put it bluntly, my brother's a worthless indolent dilettante. He has no sense of responsibility to his family or to his fellow man. And quite frankly... Quite frankly, you don't think your brother's worth saving. You're not gonna pay, is that it? That's right, Mr. Purvis. Well, I'd hate to issue a news release stating your reasons for not paying, Mr. Covington. (chuckles) You wouldn't do that, would you, Mr. Purvis? Yes, yes, I would. My reports do. See, my job is to get your brother back alive, if possible. And I intend to do that. And I'm gonna need that ransom money as bait. Now, you'll get it back. May take a little while. Just consider it a loan. (footsteps) Come in, Kate. How'd you know it was me? I ain't never brought you your lunch before. Very simple. I can tell by the, uh, lightness of your step. You're just a real smarty guy, aren't you? Well, after all, I was kicked out of five of the finest prep schools in the country to get that way. (laughs) Do you always do that? Do what? You know, make those wisecracks? Hmm. I try to see the bright side of things, if that's what you mean. But I do have my dark moments. There's a lot about me you don't know. Ah, well, I happen to know that you're worth $500,000 to us. And that's all I need to know. What are you gonna do with your end of the money if you get it? I'm gonna do the same thing you do, spend it. (snickers) In Mexico, perhaps? Oh, perhaps. I go there all the time myself. Well... maybe we'll meet again someday down there. Oh, and just what would you do if we did happen to meet up, Mr. Thatcher Covington? I'd buy you a drink and... ask you if your husband was around. And if he wasn't? Hmm, well, we'd just have to see how things develop. What makes you think I'd want anything to do with the likes of you anyway? But I'm irresistible when I set my mind to going after an attractive woman. You're a very attractive woman, Kate. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I really do. You do mean that, don't you? (running footsteps) Hey, hey! Oh, hi, George. Um, what's up? I-- They left the ad in the paper there-- Let me see that. Hot dog! Looks like you're gonna be going home, Mr. Covington. And we really wanna thank you for all this $500,000. (chuckles) Come on, George, come on, sweetheart. We got plans to make. Come on, come on. (door locks) ** Mr. Purvis. You got all your people here? Yes, sir. Well, get rid of them. No self-respecting criminal would ever come near this corner. They don't even have to lock their doors around here after today. Well, you don't think they got somebody watching us right now, do you, sir? They don't have to. The neighbors will be talking about the law enforcement convention here at the Alamar for years to come. Got any good food in there? Yes, sir, they sure do. Well, get rid of your men here. (car doors close) You got any catfish in here? Nope. What do you got that's good? Hamburgers. You boys want a hamburger? Fix me one, medium. I don't have medium, just rare and well done. All right, fix me a rare one then. (groans) You know who we are? We're federal agents. My name's Purvis, Melvin Purvis. You've probably heard of me. No, and I don't give free burgers to police. You ever hear of the Thatcher Covington kidnap case? I don't read the newspapers. You can turn that over now. It seems as though the-- the kidnappers have selected your place to make the pick-up point for the money. My place? Yeah. You can take that off now. Well, don't let the hamburger get cold. Just put some pickles on there and hold the mustard. Why'd they pick my place? I have no idea. Obviously, it wasn't because of the food. (horn honking) All right, Sam, let's get all these local police cleared out of here now. No stakeouts. You gonna let 'em just walk right in and take the money, sir? That's right. And I don't want 'em followed either. Well, I don't understand. Want to try to catch all these rats in the same trap. What about Covington, sir? Covington's gonna be better off if we let them have the money. As I told you before, these are punks, small-time punks. Just pick up-- I could follow them with a one-eyed dog through a meat house. That way we'd only get a few of them. Let them have the $500,000. Let them rub their hands in it a little bit till they get to fighting among themselves, and we'll get 'em all. Or whatever's left of them. Let's get them cleared out of here, and let's get on the way. (reporter) Do you feel the kidnappers will soon be apprehended? (Thatcher) I don't know. I'm only the victim. Daniel Moore of "The Springfield Gazette," is it true the ransom was $500,000? (Nash) Yes, yes, we had to pay $500,000. (Thatcher) That's something I want to thank you for, Nash. (Nash) Well, there was no alternative. (laughter) John Connor of "The Gary Free Press," have you any idea who they were? Do you think it might be the Barker Gang? (Thatcher) I don't know. I was blindfolded and I never saw their faces. Uh, it was actually a rather amusing adventure. Amusing adventure? Did they ever threaten your life? Every day, but one doesn't believe those things. And how long were you held by the kidnappers? Just a shade under two weeks. And you were not able to identify any of them at all? No, he can't identify them. You no doubt heard he was blindfolded for the entire 13 days. Oh, that's a bad break, not seeing their faces. Yes, it's too bad Mr. Covington can't make the identification. Then how do you intend to move against these men? To begin with, anybody that hides behind women and children or any defenseless citizen is something a good deal less than a man. More in the category of a gutter rat. Fortunately, we don't need Mr. Covington's identification. We've got information of our own. We also have men in the field collecting more information every minute of every day, and very soon, these vermin will be apprehended. You can bet on that. Now, if you gentlemen will excuse us, we've got a good deal of work to do. (reporters) Thank you very much. Were you able to-- No, no more, no more, no more, please. No, no more, thank you. (phone ringing) (typing sounds) ** What's wrong, darling? What's happening? Baby? Honey, wait! I love eggs. (door opens) Charlie. Gene, you got no class. Listen. Well, there's a lady here, we're eating. Will you listen? Well, you could've knocked. Shut up and listen! What? We've been double-crossed. Gee, honey, $500,000! Arkansas! Mm-hmm. This says they picked it up in Arkansas. Arkansas! They never had any intention of bringing it here. You got any idea where they might be holed up down there? Buckwheat's, that's where they are. Buckwheat. Well, let's go get 'em. Where you boys going? I told you to stay out of my business. Come on, let's get out of here! Take it easy, take it easy, Charlie. What's going on in here? Hey, get back in here. Come on! Whoo. That sure is one fine automobile you got here, mister. Hey, get that dirty rag off there. Fill her up! How fast this big car go? I said fill her up, boy. Yes, sir, right away, sir. Sure is some fancy machine. Yes, sir, whitewall tires. I wonder-- Keep pumping, boy, we need the gas. Yes, sir. (gas bell dinging) Hey, boy, what's this? Sir? What is this? Why, that's a $5 bill, sir. Don't you do any business in this stinkin' station? What am I gonna do with $5? Here, take it. Give it to me. Leave him alone, leave him alone! ** Oh, dog, dog, are you all right, Gene? I feel like I've been kicked by an elephant. They're dead, Gene. No, no, wait, wait. They probably got the law by now. Just, just get me out of here. Come on, get up, boy, get up. ** What a mess. Oh, God. Bad, huh, Gene? Oh, yeah, it's bad. You're gonna be fine, Gene, I swear. Yeah, guess you're right. You're gonna be okey-dokey. Oh, sh-- (coughing) Shot by an old lady. She had a gun, Gene. Yeah, I know, Charlie. ** Richard and Ryan are in St. Louis. (phone ringing) Riley and Stanhope and Little Rock and Texarkana. Mr. Covington's here to see you, sir. Which Mr. Covington? Mr. Thatcher Covington, sir. Put the gun away, Mr. Covington. We don't play with guns. Or didn't anybody ever bother to teach you that? (Thatcher) Sorry. Sit down, I've been expecting you. Yeah? Yes, I figured you had something stuck in your throat. Just be a matter of time you ought to spit it out. Here, Mr. Purvis, try one of mine. Thank you. Don't mind if I do. Just saying to Sam the other day if there's one thing about the Covingtons, they do know good cigars. I'll get right to it, Mr. Purvis. Please do. I, uh-- I know who the kidnappers are. I figured you did. The way you behaved right after they returned you. You see, stepping out the truth in a man has been a part of my business for a long time, Mr. Covington. I'm curious to know, though, why you waited so long to come forward. Because I, uh, want to make a private deal with you. Please. I want you to take me along on the hunt. You know, running down criminals is what Mr. Cowley and I are good at. In fact, you might even say we're the best at it. But I'd also have to say we'd look pretty ridiculous on a polo field. Now, do you understand what I'm getting at? Of course I do. But I've made up my mind. You see... all my life, I've drifted from one thing to another. I've never really accomplished anything important. What I'm trying to say is that helping to capture these criminals could mean something important in my life. You see, I know these people. I know how they think and how they operate. I could be a great deal of help to you. But what you're really trying to say is that unless we take you along, you're not gonna help us, huh? That's correct. You see, I don't really care what happens to these people, or to the money, for that matter, unless I'm involved. Well, that's how I see it, Mr. Purvis. And I would think a man like yourself would understand. I do understand. Now, you've got to understand that you're gonna have to contribute more than just information. You're gonna have to contribute some more of these fine cigars. Of course. And some of that magnificent champagne that you seem to enjoy so much. And you might enjoy this sport a little, Mr. Covington. It's quite different than anything you've ever hunted before. You see, this game shoots back. Now let's get down to business. It was the Machine Gun Kelly Gang. There was George Kelly, Kate, uh... (birds chirping) You know, Billy, when we get back into town, I want you to check out that hardware store. I'm pretty sure they got that stuff there. Okay. Hey, ain't that the car that robbed that filling station? There it is! That's that black Rolls. Where you going, Willy? You can't catch 'em now. I'm sure gonna try. Look it, you call the state police and tell them to set up a roadblock and that Plazaville Bridge, understand? Yeah, yeah, okay. (car starts) ** You all right, Gene? You're gonna have to get me to a doc soon, Charlie. I'm all tore up inside. Hang on, Gene, it won't be long now. I'll get you fixed right up. Uh-oh. What's a matter? Sheriff's back there, and he's gaining on us fast. ** (gunshots) Now you're gonna see why I love this baby. ** (tires screeching) Oh, take it easy on those curves, Charlie. Take it easy? He's shooting at us, Gene. I know, I know. ** Don't worry about a thing, Gene. We gonna lose that old boy now. Ha ha ha ha ha! Bye-bye. This is a good old car, Charlie. It's a wonderful automobile. Where did you get it? You don't see 'em now, do you? Oh, my God, they got us. Wait, Charlie. Charlie, turn back! Too late! Oh, my God! (tires skidding) (gunfire) Hey, what's a matter, Georgy? You left two standing. Yeah, well, Tony, you think you can do better than that, I got $500 here in my pocket says you can. Now, why don't you go on, take a try, huh? Go on, Tony, let's see what you can do. Yeah, go on. Get outta here, George, you know I ain't no good with no choppa. Well, I think you better start learning to use one, boy, 'cause you might need it someday. Go on, take a try. Well, I'll tell you something more important, Georgy. I think it's about time we started thinking about splitting up the ransom. I told you, Tony, we'll split up the ransom when we get to Memphis. I still don't know why we gotta wait until we get to Memphis. 'Cause I told you. What's a matter with you, Tony? Redecci, how many times do you have to be told? George has got to take the marked bills and exchange them for the unmarked bills in Memphis. And we are not going to spend that money or split it up until he does that. Yeah? Yeah. How long we gonna wait? Until we think it's safe to travel. I'll tell you something. This still doesn't make any sense to me. Hey, Tony, I'll tell you something. You don't make any sense to me. Excuse me, Mr. Kelly, hope I'm not interrupting. Would y'all mind posing for me? What? I wanna take your picture. I think that's a good idea. Now, come on, honey, let's take a picture. Tony, come on, let's all go and take a picture. Come on, Tony. Come on, everybody! We're gonna take a picture. Picture time. Y'all smile pretty now. Come on, kiss the girls now. (camera shutter clicks) This one? (laughter) Now kiss the other one. You dumbbell. Let's get one more. Now y'all smile. (camera shutter clicks) Gotcha. Howdy, Mr. Purvis. Howdy. See anything? Not yet. Mr. Covington here seems to think we're getting close now. That's right. This area definitely seems familiar to me. I know I've been here before. It's getting on to about 2:30. Son? Who, me? Yes, you, come over here. They say the food's pretty good over at Greenville. Is that right? Sure is, they got a barbecue pit and real fine catfish. Thank you. I see no reason to drive beyond the catfish. We'll go ahead and search until suppertime. We'll all meet up in Greenville. Let's go. ** Howdy. How are you? Oh, pretty good except, uh, seem to be lost. Looking for the road to Greenville. You take the first main road going north. You can't miss it. All right, thanks a lot. That was it. That's the place. I figured it was. The way you moved when you saw the old man. Are we going back after them? Not right now, Mr. Covington. You gonna wait? They might get away. I doubt that. We'll have somebody keep an eye on them. When are we going back? Oh, about daybreak, when we can see 'em. That way, none of the vermin will get away. Meanwhile, we have plenty of time to have some of that good catfish. (rooster crowing) ** (birds chirping) Give me that Tommy gun. Yes, sir. Come here, son. We're gonna drive up in front down there and blow the horn. That'll create a diversion. Now, you tell all these men along this levee here as soon as they hear the horn, start moving in behind the house there. Take up positions. Catch anybody in the crossfire that tries to come out the back way. Is that clear? Yes, sir. The rest of you men, move in across the street there and get yourselves hidden and stay there till I give you the word. (all) Yes, sir. What about these local boys here, Mr. Purvis? They, uh, seem a little anxious to get in on the action. Good morning. You boys ready? Yes, sir, Mr. Purvis. Now, as you know, this levee road is the only backroad out of town. Anybody comes up this road will expect you boys to stop 'em. Any questions? Good luck. When we get there, the local boys won't be necessary. So that does it. Keep them from messing up our operation. Sure. Know how to use that? Yes, sir. Let's go. ** All right, let's wake them up. Blow your horn. (horn honking) Blow it again. (horn honking) Hey, what the hell's going on out here? Don't y'all know what time it is? You tell them to throw down their guns, come walking out the front door-- Pa, it's the law! Pa! Pa, Pa! Tony! (gunfire) (shouting) Ah! Hey! They killed my pa, they killed my pa! George! George! They got Pa, they got Pa! They got Pa! Get down, Buckwheat, get down! No! Ah! Somebody near a window! I got him, I got him! Hey, Tony! Come on, come on. (George) Come on, hotshot! Kelly, Kelly! Go, George! Go! (Tony) Go, Georgy, baby! Go! They're gonna make it, Buckwheat. They're gonna make it. (gunfire) Tony, what are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? He's got the money! ** I'm coming, George. Wait for me! Go, go! Go, Tony! Tony! Nah! ** Come on, honey. Move. ** Georgy! Georgy, wait for me! ** Georgy! Georgy, wait for me! Georgy, Georgy! Wait for me, Georgy! Ah! Nothing going on around here. Hey, Georgy! ** Here they come. (thud) I'm afraid I got bad news for you, Mr. Purvis. The Kellys are gone up the levee road with the money. Twenty men outside and you let them get through? Sorry, sir. Sorry. Well, they didn't all get away. Who's up there? Are you alive up there? Now, son, this is Melvin Purvis down here. You're gonna have to shoot a whole lot straighter than that if you expect to stop me. And right now, you're getting me mad. You ain't Purvis. I seen pictures of Purvis, and you ain't him. Well, don't gamble your life on that. Now, I know you're hurt. Possibly you're dying. There's one thing that's as sure as the sun coming up tomorrow, that Kelly and his girlfriend are gonna be spending your money. They're probably on their way to Mexico right now. And tomorrow for them, everything's gonna be sunshine and sweet Marie. But they left you here to die like a dog. You're a liar! You're a dirty, black-tongue liar! (gunfire) Now, son, I could come up there and put one of those right through you. But don't make me do that. Give yourself up, come on down here. Don't, don't. Don't, don't shoot no more! (sobbing) I'm coming down. I don't wanna die, Mr. Purvis! (crying) Mr. Purvis, I-- I don't wanna die. (crying) You're gonna be all right. You're not gonna die. Where was Kelly going? (crying) It'll be all right, son. Gonna be all right. (crying) You wanna tell me where Kelly was going? (quivering) He was going to, to Memphis, Mr. Purvis... (crying) to the Monarch Hotel. (crying) It's all right, it's all right. It's gonna be all right. You did the right thing, son. You did the right thing. Over here. Take care of him. Get him some help. ** (Tony) Georgy, don't tell me that. Suppose they talk. Suppose they tell them where we're going. Wait a minute, Tony, it's only Buckwheat. Buckwheat ain't gonna say nothing. He wouldn't? No, he wouldn't. Hey, Redecci, look, why don't you just stop whining? You just giving me such a headache. I'm not going to Memphis. What, you're not going to Memphis? I want my share of the money. I want my share of the money now. No, no, no, you don't, Tony. Huh-uh. Pull up the road up there, George. Why you pulling off the road for? Come on, Georgy, what are you doing now? You're gonna get your share, Tony. Right now, you're gonna get your share. You want your share? All right, you're gonna get your share. Get out. Georgy. Get out, Get out! Georgy, what are you doing to me? Georgy, you know I didn't mean nothin'. What are you doing? Come here, come here, come here. Come on! Come on, right here. Give me that other gun. Give me the gun! What are you doing? Give me the gun. Move. Georgy. Now move! Move. That's it, stop there. (panting) Now you and I are gonna have ourselves a little duel. Duel? What do you mean, duel? Georgy, I can't use no choppa. Yeah, well, you better start learning fast, and you pick it up. Pick it up! Get up, get up. Now, here's the rules. We're gonna start off with our backs to each other. And when I start counting, we walk away from each other. Then when I get to ten, we turn around and we fire. You got it? What's a matter? How do I know I can trust you, Georgy? You ain't got no choice, do you? No. Then turn around. Turn around, turn around! I'm gonna start counting. One... two... three... four... five... six... You didn't play fair, Tony! (moaning) (Purvis) January the 11th, 2:45am, the Monarch Hotel, Memphis, Tennessee. Acting on the information supplied us by Longaker, we were ready to close the book on Machine Gun Kelly. No need to panic. FBI. I'm Melvin Purvis. What room is George Kelly in? Did you hear the question? Yes, sir, I certainly did, sir. Mr. Kelly's in, uh, uh, 29, on the sixth floor. Give me a pass key. Yes, sir. Where's your elevator? Elevator? Yes, the elevator. I'm sorry, sir, but the elevator's been out of order for sometime now. You did say the sixth floor? Oh, yes, sir. (coughing) George, aren't you ever going to sleep? I don't know. I'm worried. Hey. What's a matter, Georgy? The bill is all numbered-- all numbers in the paper, see? And no fed's gonna touch it. It's all numbered. I'm gonna handle it for you. (whimpering) Yeah? Don't I always handle everything for you? Huh? Okay, then. Come on, why don't you just relax, baby? Try and get some sleep. Come on now. Let's sleep. Hold it right there, Kelly. (gunfire) All right, now wait a minute, G-Man. Hold on! You don't have to shoot us. You don't have to kill us, come on, G-Man. What'd he call me, Sam? Uh, G-Man? G-Man? Government man. I like that. Yes, sir, I think Mr. Hoover's gonna like that, too. Take care of them, Sam. (Sam) All right, miss, put some clothes on. Hey, you got a visitor. Come on. What? What do you want? Well, I'm leaving for Europe in a few weeks, and I... I just thought it would be nice if we could have lunch together before I leave. Nice? Oh. You thought it would be nice? It's, uh, quite a good meal. I had it catered. Mr. Purvis okayed it personally. He's quite a colorful character. A real original. Well, anyway, I just, uh, thought it would be nice if we could talk. I wanted you to know that if things had been different, we might have-- Different? Let me tell you about different, Mr. Thatcher Covington. You're different. And you'll never know how different. Well, I realize-- You realize nothin'. Did you ever freeze in a one-room tar shack with five brothers and four sisters? Huh, did you? No. Well, did you ever watch your belly swell up from eating nothing but turnip greens and fried grease because that's all there ever was to eat? Now just a moment. Naturally, I never had-- No, no, you never had to do these things because you were out getting your pictures in the papers, going off to some swanky party or riding horses, or sailing off to Europe. I know you. You spent more in one week than we ever made in our whole lives. George is a killer. And George is a bank robber and a kidnapper, and so am I. But I'm gonna tell you something. You done this to us. You done this to us! You and all the rest of that rich trash. And I hope you rot in hell! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me. (wailing) ** How'd it go, son? Not good, Mr. Purvis. Not good at all. I'm sorry. Maybe you don't know these people as well as you thought you did. (car starts) Rich people like that, they're different from us. Yeah, they are, Sam. They got more money. (man) Shine there, mister? Shine? Believe I will. I seen you before. Ain't I seen you in the newspapers? Maybe. I know I done seen you in the newspapers. You the one that said you're gonna get Johnny Dillinger. Ain't that right? That's right. What's your name again? Name's Purvis, Melvin Purvis. G-Man. ** Put a spit shine on them, will ya, friend? Wanna be able to see my face in them when I look down. **
