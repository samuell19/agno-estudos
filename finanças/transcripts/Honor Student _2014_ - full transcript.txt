The wind had stopped. It was quiet. The sky hung over us like a dead man. We felt each other's hearts and knew love would be found anyway. [applause] That was really something, Caroline. It was so full of hope. And the expression you used about the sky. The sky hung over us like a dead man. Yes. Like a dead man. Teresa. What do we call that? I'd call that alright. That's a simile. Right, Mr. Howarth? That's right, Wanda. You've personified the word 'sky' here and given it a human quality. Teresa. Can you give me an example of a personification? Earth to Theresa. Please respond. [laughter] Ladies. Under the opening eyelids of the morn, We drove afield; and both together heard What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn. Yes, that's a very good example. The writer in this case, Milton, says the morning has eyelids like a man. [knocking] Time's up Mr. Howarth. On that note I have to say goodbye. As you all know, this class completes our course. You might be back, Mr. Howarth. She's right Mr. H. Most of us have been in here more than once. [laughter] Well if I do see any of you again, I hope it's on the outside. But I would like to thank you for your great work. I hope I've given you some useful tools to help you with your writing. And remember, each of you has a story to tell. So sit down and write it. And who knows? Maybe I'll be reading yours someday. [Applause] [Alarm rings] Hey Teresa. You got a sec? Did the class help you at all? I haven't been able to write since I got here. I know. But every writer's felt like you do now. In prison? Hm. Metaphorically speaking. Yes. Blocked. Unsure of yourself. It's obvious you're really smart and well-read but you haven't written a word for me. Twelve sessions together and I didn't get a single sentence on paper from you. Well, I got a couple years here to kick it around. So you are thinking about something. Just start writing. You might surprise yourself. It's about a young woman. A girl, really. 16. Went to university early. Ah. An honor student. Yeah. Top of her class all of her life. Then she goes to college and um, she gets mixed up with a professor. Oh, an affair. And it goes bad for her. Him, too. She kills him. And? That's all I got. Well it's a start. It's a bit broad but that's okay. I mean there's definitely conflict there. So write something down, damn it! I will. And thanks. Hey! It's my job. Good luck. Good news, Lana. You are definitely pregnant and the tests show this baby's viable. Oh my god. That's great. I really want this baby. I know you do. So, your husband. It's probably a good time to tell him. I want to wait a little bit more. When we lost the last one, he got very depressed. And we both did. Believe me I get it. I know it's been tough on both of you. But you have to stay calm and relaxed throughout the whole pregnancy. I don't want you to overtire or worry yourself. I know the drill. No stress. Good. I'm going to start you on some new medication for your blood pressure today. And you keep close tabs on your insulin. I always do. It's gonna happen Lana! [Gunshots] Hard at work? Oh it was either this or shoot the computer. Your sister really came through. It's the best wedding present ever. Well instead of scaring my chickens call Erica. She'll extend the deadline. My extremely patient publisher's already extended it. Twice. [gunshot] Return the advance. After your last book you can afford to sit back and wait until the muse strikes. Sure, yeah, sign away the money and my self-respect. I need to get a new book out before everyone forgets who I am. Hey I was thinking maybe we could go out for dinner tonight, in town, after your talk. What talk? At the bookstore? Is that tonight? Your public awaits. Oh god. So? Dinner? In town, time to talk? Yeah. Yeah. [gunshot] From the sound and the fury to Huck Finn. All good stories are well-structured. And by structure I mean more than beginning, middle and end. I'm talking about layering in subplots, which if they're done right carry the theme while the main story moves along. Excuse me? Yeah. So you're saying plot is more important than character. You need both. Any plot is much more satisfying if it focuses on real characters. So you write one book nobody buys and then Killer Student sells, like hotcakes. What do you think made the people eat it up? You know? I don't know. I poured my heart and soul into it. But I do that with all my writing. I guess there's just something about a good murder, right? [Laughs] Okay, I think maybe time for one more question and then we'll let Nick sign some books. Where did you get the idea for Killer Student Mr. Howarth? Uh, where does any idea come from? People. Situations, right. The unconscious soup that all writers spoon up. But it isn't just about the idea, it's about the execution. Okay! [Applause] This made me a big fan. When's your next one coming out? Soon. Don't worry. Very soon. Hi Mr. Howarth. I'm a big fan too. You know I had to read it twice. The first time I just couldn't believe it. Let me tell you what to write. After all, we work best that way. To a very real character... who found herself in a very real plot. I, uh, I appreciate your support. No doubt. Tell me! You still teaching? No, I haven't since, well not for some time. Well. That's my loss. Hey, it's late. Okay, a few more. Thanks. We should have had dinner in town tonight. I'm sorry. No, you couldn't leave before you'd signed everybody's book. Who was that girl at the end? Which one? [coughs] The pretty one. Oh that's just a former student of mine, that's all. I taught her years ago. Listen, honey. I've been thinking. Why don't we get away for a week or two? We've been promising ourselves Maui. I mean we can pack up tonight. I promised Shannon we'd visit next week. It's her birthday. Remember? Yeah, well we'll get her a present in Hawaii. I'm serious. And wanted to see her remodel, you know. Get some ideas for this place. I'm offering you Kanaapali and you're talking about your sister in Seattle? Come on, let's just pack up and leave like we used to. Babe, what do you say? Uh. Well she was really flirty, wasn't she? Who? No. Yes. Yeah. A little. Was she like that in class? No, not one little bit. Look, you're the only ex-student of mine I care about. And the one, and only one, that I want to take to the islands. Nick, I'm not going to Hawaii with this book hanging over our heads. Why? You'll be a total pain. If you can't write here, you won't be able to write on a beach in Maui. Alright you wait. By the end of the week I'll have a couple chapters. Then we'll get on a plane. Deal? Deal. PacWest. Hi, yeah I'm calling about a former prisoner there named Teresa Smith. I see from your website she was released last April. Okay. I was wondering if I could get the name of her parole officer. I'm sorry sir, but we cannot release that information. Oh but you see I used to work there. She was a student of mine. We're not permitted to release that information. You can send an inquiry to the Board of Corrections. Okay thanks. You're welcome. [birds squawking] [Whistling] Not much here, Nick. How did you get in here? Oh these big old houses are no problem to get into. What's the matter? Lost your muse? Sit down. Now. I want my life back. What are you talking about? You took my life. I want it back. What life? My story. My past. That's all I have. That's all any writer has. What do you know about writing? Have you written a single word since my class? I gave you a story. A very commercial one, as it turns out. You had an idea. Everybody in the world has ideas. So get over it. Every week I saw Killer Student on the bestseller list. Every review. Every interview. And it felt like you took something from me that I can never have back. Wait a minute. But what could I do, locked up in prison? The parole board wants to hear me quoting the bible. Not claiming that some novelist ripped me off. Nobody ripped you off Teresa. I wrote 100,000 words from a one-sentence idea. Yeah, trouble is I can't do anything with that idea now, can I? You used it. This is crazy. I have to get back to work. Not to this drivel, I hope. Oops, gone. Damnit Teresa! I thought a lot about you touching me in prison. I fantasized about you. Or the idea of you. Does that count? The idea of a man? Ideas are nothing, unless they're acted on. Otherwise they're just daydreams. Now what do you want? Half. And no, I'm not daydreaming. Half your royalties from Killer Student, the same for any TV and Film rights. And I want a press conference to announce why you're doing it. No! Definitely no. And are you out of your fricking mind? No! You're so funny! But then again all good writers are. Why don't critics ever talk about how funny Faulkner was? It's time for you to leave. But the thing is we'll never know how much of that book was yours and how much of it was mine. That's why 50/50s the only fair solution. And you coming clean to the public, of course. No way. No way. It would ruin my reputation. I would never be published again. You might as well just kill me. Hello. It's Lana, right? I'm Teresa Smith. Just a big fan of your husband. Not to worry, Nick. I'm sure that we can work out something. Together. Work what out? Oh I'm just looking for a new writing teacher. Someone that I can trust just as much as I used to trust your husband. Talk soon, Nick. She's blocked. Like so many wannabe writers, she wants to talk about writing, instead of doing it. And she wants to talk about it with you, Nick? Here in my house? Yes, Lana. Because I was her teacher. And that's all I was. [Phone rings] Hello? [Dial tone] Hello? [Dial tone] [Dialing] Hello? Hey, it's your little sister. Hey! What's up? What's up? Well. I want to have a glass of wine but I'm not allowed in my condition. I have no clue what to do for dinner. And I want to kill my husband. Here's what you do. Drink the wine, order takeout... wh-wait. You're pregnant? Almost eight weeks. I haven't told Nick yet. He's too busy writing or not writing his new book. Well you have to tell him. Let him take care of you for a change. It'll send him over the edge. He'll learn to fly! Why don't you come see me? You need someone who's going to take care of you. [Beep] Ugh Shannon. There's someone on the other line. Let me get rid of them. Hello? [Dial tone] Hello? Shannon, they hung up. It was probably the pretty psycho girl. Psycho girl? Some ex-student of Nick's that has just come out... What's for dinner? Whatever you decide to cook. So Shannon. What do you want for your birthday? [chickens bawking] [chickens bawking] Hi little chickies. You're a creature of habit aren't you? Easy to find. Look I've been thinking about things. You've been thinking about me? I can give you a loan. Something to help you get on your feet. How about, um, 10? 10? Thousand. Thanks for the thought. Now think bigger. Exponentially bigger. You're an ex-con. Who's going to believe you? Oh Nicky. You'd be surprised. You know what? Take it or leave it. I'm sorry Nick but I'm going to have to decline your proposition. Marcia. Hi. Hi! This is an old student of mine, Teresa Smith. Oh not that old, Nick! Oh I saw you at the book signing! Yes! I love your store. All the little books, these fresh baked pastries. But $4.50 a piece, my goodness. A girl's gotta have money even in a small town, huh? Right Nick? Well. See you, Marcia. I'll call you later tonight Nicky. Looks like she has a pretty serious crush on the teacher. Nope. She's got another fantasy going. Oh hi Lana. What a surprise. How are you? Hello. It's Teresa. Mhm. Doing some shopping? Me too. Out of condoms. Just ran into an old boyfriend and you know. That's fascinating. Yeah, well. There's no sex as good as sex with your ex, so I'm stocking up. You know what they say. Better safe. Teresa if you really want to be safe stay away from my husband. It's like she was stalking me to tell me there was something between you two. Believe me, there wasn't. Or there still is. Come on, that's ridiculous. Well then why is she acting like this? The old crush on the teacher thing. It's stupid. Was it stupid when we met? We need to stop by Sammy's, see if the truck's ready. Did you call him? He said pick it up Thursday. I called him. It's not done. [chickens bawking] How did the chickens get out? Did you forget to shut the coop? No. Look I'll get them... [chickens bawking] I don't know why I like these stupid things! Hopefully because I gave them to you. Babe I swear. There's nothing going on. When she was my student I gave her a lot of attention but only to get her writing. How about I give you some attention? Not in front of the chickens. Poor things. There's no rooster around to give them some loving. [laughs] I'll meet you inside. Okay. Those damn birds are dumber than... what? No no. Teresa said she was buying these at the pharmacy for her old boyfriend. Lana, calm down. Would I be stupid enough to do something in our house? She's playing a game to make you think that... [Door slams] ...there's something going on. Could you leave please? I need to keep my blood pressure down. I... Alright. Okay. I haven't been honest with you. I met her in prison. She was a student from that session I did at PacWest. I never slept with her. What does she want? She wants the world to know that Killer Student is her book. It isn't. It's mine. But... she had this idea about a girl... killing her teacher. It was my last day. I got her to open up a little bit and she talked to me about it. But she never showed me anything on paper. I couldn't get it out of my head. There was sex, passion, murder. What's not to like? And for three years it just went around and around. After a while it felt like mine. It turned into mine. And I made it mine when I wrote it. She didn't write one word. I mean that girl, she couldn't write a grocery list. That's why I'll be damned if she gets any recognition, much less half the royalties. Have you talked to Phil? If I get a lawyer involved, she gets a lawyer and the whole thing goes public. Well you should have thought about that beforehand. I didn't do anything wrong. I took what was just a conversation and I turned it into a novel. It happens every single day. Legal or moral, I just don't want her trashing my reputation. You know what? I'll pay her off. Under the table. Will you at least talk to Erica? What good is talking to the publisher? So then she can think that the book isn't really mine? Nick! This woman is a criminal. Who knows what she might do? I'm not going to let some crazy felon jeopardize my career. I'm finally experiencing success and I won't risk losing that. I won't. And no one can make me. [car sounds] What the hell? Where you going? Shannon's. It's her birthday, remember? Yeah but that's not until next week. Let me go. Why are you leaving? You know there's nothing going on with that girl. It's not always about you, Nick. Whether you flirted with her or screwed her on the roof, I really need to stay calm right now. I know. I know. Your blood pressure. But why don't you just stay and let me take care of you? Right. You. Take care of me. I will. I love you. I can do this. How? That book had you crazy even before this girl showed up and you won't ask anyone for help. I'll call you when I get to Shannon's. You don't have to do this. Yes. I do, Nick. You have work to do. And you have to fix whatever it is that you have done. I know. Feed the chickens. Take care of the problem, Nick. So that I can come home. [Noises coming from other room] Lana? What the hell are you doing here? Sure beats those prison treats. I want you out of my house. You're still playing with me Nick and I don't appreciate it. This is serious business. Don't think your little stunt drove Lana away. Oh no that was you. Yeah and now it's your turn. Get out. After I've responded to your offer. What offer? Of 10. I want 10,000 this week and another 10 next. Cash. Just get out of my life! That's not the support I'm looking for. Then contact my lawyer. And you can talk to mine. He'll be right by my side at the press conference. What you said in Killer Student? It's true. Killing is never spontaneous. The action might appear sudden to the victim, but the killer's fantasized about it for a long, long time. But when you look at me Nick, I don't think it's violence you fantasize about. Sheriff. Nick Howarth. We bought the Hartley farm a while ago. Oh yeah! The writer guy. What can I do for you? I have a problem. A former student of mine has been coming around and stalking us. Look she's a felon. An ex-con. And now she's trying to shake me down. Shake you down? For what exactly? Well for starters she wants my wife to believe that we, uh, that we had an affair. Did you? No. No no no. Absolutely not. But she broke into my house. She's harassing us. And now she's demanding money to stop. What's her name again? Teresa Smith. Middle initial A. She was a student of mine at Pacwest Correctional. Got a match, Sheriff. Teresa Arlington Smith. Just one arrest and one conviction but it's a good one. Voluntary manslaughter. College cops at OSU arrested her. She was 17. I remember hearing about that one. Killed her professor or something. Sentenced 6-15 years. Paroled first time up. Killed her teacher? Mhm. She works at the 50s diner here in town and uh, she sticking to her parole. So I'm not sure what I could do right now. I could go and talk to her but why exactly is she doing this to you? She knew me from prison. She thinks I'm an easy mark. Why did she kill her college professor? Well who knows. But you know, murderers especially female ones have the lowest recidivism rate of all criminals. They kill the guy that was abusing them, do their time and become model citizens. Sheriff. I'm asking you to help me with someone who's terrorizing my family. I pay my taxes. Easy now. I have an idea. If we could somehow catch her in the act... Yes. Yes that's it. Then I can close the book on her for good. He swears nothing's going on but I just had to get out. I.. I.. could literally feel the blood start to boil behind my eyeballs. You know I wonder how long she's been on his mind. Bastard. You know I wanted to tell him about the baby! But there was the book and the deadline and now she keeps popping up. Don't obsess over it Lana. Let Nick take care of it. What if he can't? It is scary what she's asking for. The money and telling everybody it's her story. I see why he's scared. I'm scared. I cannot go through another miscarriage. You're not going to. You can stay here the whole time if you have to. Ugh. Yep. We'll see you tomorrow, bitch. Then it's all over. No. [Cell phone rings] Screw you Teresa. I'm writing. You should try it some time. [Home phone rings] Hi Nick. Lana. Hi. Here's a good word. I'm writing. Stayed up all night and piled up the pages. I finally found a way to that story. That is good. Yeah so come home honey. Now that I'm writing, I'm a normal human being again. I miss you. And the chickens and I, we're all crying your name around here. Hmm. How about our other problem? Oh. I'm on that too. That'll all be solved later today. Why? What happens then? Oh don't worry. The Sheriff and I have a plan. She's going back to jail. Will it be dangerous? No. No it'll be quick and clean. But we can't have her messing with our marriage. No. We can't. Especially now. Okay. I'll check in later. I love you. Hey Nicky. I'm here. Hope you're hungry because I'm starving. Spaghetti carbonara okay? Cut it down Teresa. Oh someone's having a hard day. We both know why you're here. Okay. I want you to give it to me. Huh? Look. I like talking dirty in bed too, but right now I am trying to prepare lunch. There it is. It's all there. Your money. Nick. I know you like giving me presents but I don't want your money. That just.. ugh. That makes me feel cheap. Besides, after last night, I'm the one who owes you. Ahem. I've heard enough kids. No, Sheriff. This isn't... She's acting. Son, I never know when they're acting or not. Okay what's going on now. Look, here's the money. Mr. Howarth. I don't have enough proof here. I never heard her ask you for money and she wouldn't take it when you offered it to her. She must have known you were here. Look Nick if you're feeling guilty because you're cheating on your wife, you don't have to go and do... Shut up! Steady there. She has a violent record. Doesn't that give me the benefit of the doubt? Yes, and that's why I came by today but you have wasted enough of my time. No I... I'm not done. I'm filing a report. Fine. When will your wife be available for questioning? Okay. How'd you know? I went to the chicken coop to get eggs for the carbonara. Imagine my surprise when I saw the police cruiser beside the barn. We're not going to get anywhere with you playing games like that Nicky. Two guys go into a bar. One's a rabbi, one's a priest. No, this isn't a joke. They have a beer. One guy tells the other guy a story. Ugh you're so transparent. Afterwards the other guy goes home and spends a year writing a novel. Just from the outline of that exchange. You're right. This isn't a joke. So. Does the novelist owe the other guy half of what he made on the novel? Just because of the conversation? It depends. Are they friends BSing over a beer? In that case, no money's owed but if they're both writers, that's something else. And if one guy's the young girl's writing teacher. I didn't think you would do anything with it. Ever. Did you? Did you even try? And if the young girl's down on her luck, with nothing in the world except that story? Well then that's an undeniably lethal situation. I'm not scared of you. I don't want you scared. I want you writing. We're not two guys at a bar, Nick. We're real. Our stories. They're real. It hurts to have them stolen. When that happens? Things get ugly. Where is my book? All my files are gone. The flash drive. Where is it? Hi Nicky. I want it back. More coffee, Sheriff? Tell me though. Why the title The First Wife? Give me back my book. One condition. And one little change. No. No. It's my... Hell of a good read. Oh it's better than good. It's brilliant. Would you sign it for me? Yeah, thanks Sheriff. You know, I can't help noticing how Ms. Smith's own life is an inspiration for you. He says it all the time Sheriff. I do not. Oh. No any similarities are strictly coincidental. It's a little surprising seeing you here with her Mr. Howarth. Oh no no no no no. This is not a social call. We're talking about another book. Really? Mhm. No. No. Not at all, actually. Well good luck. Or not. One condition. And one change. What? We're partners. All the way. 50/50. And I forget about what you did to me with Killer Student. I won't change a word. One little change. On the title page. Not happening. Crazy bitch. That one always depressed me. I like this book. It's the author who has me worried. He said it would all be over today but I haven't heard from him. You really think there's something between him and little miss demented? I don't know. You okay? I just wish I knew what was really going on. Don't think that he wants her. You know he doesn't. He wants you. And a kid. I'm afraid what he really wants is success. Sometimes I think that's all he loves. I can't find my phone. Did you take it? What do you want in your omelette? You do realize I can shoot you right now for trespassing? Careful. Writing in prison isn't easy. My phone. Are we really going to do this, Nicky? Come on. Lighten up. Have something to eat. Tomatoes, scallions and feta. Or you can have that pizza you got in the freezer. Dinner's at 8. And spruce up a bit, will ya? Get writing, and I'll be back after work. [Phone rings] Hello? Nick? Yes, this is Nick's cell. I'm his assistant, Teresa Smith. He's busy writing right now. Well hallelujah! Uh, is he available this weekend? Not sure. He's really rolling. Well tell him Erica Edwards will be in Seattle on Friday. I'd like to come see him on Saturday, read a few chapters of the new book. Yes. I'll give him the message. Dinner is served. Voila. This looks incredible. Did they have cooking classes in prison too? I'm more than just a felon, you know. Actually I don't. Why don't you tell me? Why, so you can steal it for the prequel? When I wrote Killer Student, I didn't know that was... Didn't know or didn't want to know? Both. The prison didn't give me your case history. It wasn't allowed. And when I sat down to write the book I didn't do any research on you. You didn't have to. I already told you. An idea. In three lines. The girl in my book wasn't you. Of course she was me. She killed her teacher out of passion. What happened? With him? [clears throat] Here's the cliff notes version. She fell in love with her English professor. And not because he was smart and literate but because he read poetry to her. He was her mentor. Her friend. Her lover. But it was just a pathetic Daddy complex. Doesn't matter if it's a father complex. You loved him. And he dumped me. I was crushed. So how'd you do it? What a crime groupie you are. All writers are. My professor's last book was A Literary History of Threnody. Those are speeches that are given at.. Yeah. Funerals and lamentations. Elegies. Right. Here I am feeling like I'm about to die and this guy's writing on what to say about dead people. I took my gun to his office. I found the bastard wooing the next girl he had in line. I made her go home, sat down and I made him read me his whole book. It took hours. And when it was over, I took the gun and I aimed it. At my head. And I asked him, which one of these famous speeches are you going to read over my dead body? And I swear if he'd said Romeo and Juliet, he'd still be alive today. Well. Which did he pick? Well he wasn't a romantic. He picked Marc Antony's eulogy for Julius Caesar. So I shot the bastard. I'll never be treated like that again. I formalized our agreement. You did what? Our deal. About sharing credit and money on The First Wife. Yeah I've been thinking about that. You know, it'd be better for you if your first book had your name alone. I already have a reputation. Everybody would I think I did all the work. Oh my god. You're giving me the whole book? Oh my god! Nick! Thank you! No, hold on. Just wait a second. Wait. I know I know I know, you're married, it's just this is the greatest thing anyone's ever done for me. You don't understand. I'm not talking about giving you The First Wife. I'm talking about sponsoring your novel. The one you're working on. I'll work with you on it and I'll guarantee it gets published. Your writing, your work, your name. You're really going to try and screw me again? No. I want to help you become a real writer. The First Wife is a book. It's not just some movie where no one cares who wrote it. It's a novel. Having two names on it wouldn't do either one of us any good. It would do me good. Okay. I promise I'll read this, okay? I don't care if you read it. Sign it. Do you want to kill me Teresa? What I want is this book. It's mine. I'm writing it. I'm making it... it's like a child. I can't just... give it up. Even if you killed me. Augh!! I killed a writer who used me but I let him finish his book. [Screams] So I'll extend you the same courtesy. Go ahead and make your baby, Nick. But remember, people die in childbirth. [groans] A novel of your own. Nick likes it? Well, send me a chapter. Great, I'll get it to you tonight. Oh my god. Ouch! It's not that bad. What happened? Barn door. Do you have time for a coffee? Oh better not. I'm short-staffed. I need to ask you a favour. Could you hang on to this for me? What is it? It's my new book actually. I don't get it. It's a little hard to explain. I would just feel better having a copy out of the house. Don't you have a copy on the cloud? Yeah but that's only as safe as your computer. If someone hacks in... Okay yeah sure. But I am going to read it. That's fine. Oh the special order your assistant placed for you has come in. Who? Teresa. Did you know this was dedicated to her? No. I did not. I swear to god I'm going to kill her. Dedicated to Teresa. So young and fair, she'll dance on my grave. Irony. [sighs] Ugh!!!!!! [Phone ringing] Erica? You're a real life genius, Nick! I wish I woke up this way every morning. Or afternoon. You deserve to. Not only did you give me a huge bestseller but you got a protégé who's about to do the same. What are you talking about? The First Wife. It's going to be the biggest slam dunk since Killer Student! How did you get it? Well she emailed it to me last night. She? Teresa? Yeah. Wherever did you find her? It's not her book. It's mine. That little bitch stole my book. Uh Nick look, I'm flying to Seattle tonight. It's mine Erica. I wrote every word. Okay all the more reason we should meet. Teresa. Not gonna dance on my grave. Okay. No no no no no. Nothing. Hi, you've reached Langley Books & Coffee. Leave a message or just come on down. Hey, Marcia it's Nick. Listen can you call me as soon as you open? You know what never mind I'm on my way down to the store myself. I'm gonna kill that little bitch! Feed the chickens. Oh great. We need to talk. Yeah, uh, I agree. I got a lot to tell you. It's been pretty crazy around here. How are my birds? What is it? They, uh... Sorry honey. They're dead! And you can bury them. Teresa broke into the house again. Took every file of my book. Luckily I gave one to Marcia. Marcia. Do you think that after Teresa and Marcia and Erica and god knows who else, you could give one minute for your pregnant wife? How long? About 9 weeks. Look I had no idea oh my god. How are you? Pissed. And scared. No no don't be. Not of Teresa. Of you. I am going to need you full-time if we go through with this. I swear if they gave a Pulitzer for selfishness, you would be their first candidate. You know I'll be there for you. I don't know that. At all. You are so used to me making everything okay for you. I can take care of you. My hypertension is a problem. Okay? And my diabetes. I'm sorry. This isn't going to be easy. I might not even make it to full-term but I really want this baby. So do I honey. So do I. Just give her half of what you've made. An agreement beforehand wouldn't have given her five percent. Well that's why you should have had an agreement beforehand. And a press conference too, huh? Well maybe a press conference saying it was her idea that got you started. All I know is I sure as hell don't want her near my next book. No, you don't. [Phone ringing] Hey Marcia. What? When? Did you see who? That's alright, it's okay, don't worry about it. As long as you're not hurt badly. Okay, thanks. Teresa? She mugged Marcia last night. And got the back-up copy of my book. Oh no. Well now the Sheriff can arrest her. No, Marcia didn't see her. What the hell am I gonna do? You said that Erica read it so she has a copy? No, Teresa emailed her a copy. Said it was hers. Erica knows you. Don't panic. I swear to god I could kill her. Don't go near her or you might. You're right. I'm going to end this right now with a big cheque. Half the royalties from Killer Student. Hey let a lawyer do it. I can't wait. I haven't copyrighted the next book. She could be out there sending it to other publishers right now. I'm sorry babe but I'll be giving her a lot of money. We'll have enough left. Today's special is Salisbury steak. Wow. Oh Nick, you write the sweetest things. But that's nothing compared to what I can get for The First Wife. You're not getting anything from that book. But I will give you half of Killer Student. And we can have a press conference. Nick, don't you see? This isn't really about money. This is about writing. You were right. A book with two names on it does nothing for me. But my own? This one? Will really establish me. You're insane! And attacking Marcia like that? And betraying me like that? I thought we had a deal. I've done all I can to help you write. I can do even more. And I'll give you money. But I will not allow you to plagiarize me. You plagiarized my life. I wrote my story. You could have written yours. If you could have written. You try writing in jail. I could write anywhere. It's what I do. You just talk about it. Anywhere, huh? You should know I'm not all talk. I don't have time for this. Ahhh! Jesus, are you okay? You okay? [sobbing] Get away from me! Oh my god! No don't hurt me please! Did you finally figure out I didn't do it? Nope. You made bail. Sign here to confirm receipt of your personal items. Sheriff come on, you don't really think I assaulted her. I mean you've read her record. You know she's dangerous. Why's she going after you? Did you take her story or something? The story's irrelevant. What I'm afraid of is that the next time she won't hurt herself. But someone else. Nick! I'm so sorry. I can't believe this. Are you okay? Yeah. Look Erica just so you know I didn't assault that girl. Jail time only adds to a writer's toolbox. And it doesn't hurt book sales either. Let's go home. I know Killer Student is your story. And your characters. But if Teresa goes to trial anything is possible. Could she say The First Wife is hers too? Sure. You never know what a jury could do. They maybe would award her royalties from both books. She can't be a part of Nick's career forever. I've got to get rid of her. Get a quick claim on her, from Killer Student. That way she can't come after you or me as the deep pockets publisher. [Knocking at door] I'm glad you did that to yourself. Payback for Marcia. You're the one that got her involved. What do you want? I'm here to see my publisher. Teresa Arlington Smith. Very nice to meet you. Alright then. Welcome home, Lana. We missed you. Teresa. I know you say The First Wife is your book, but I have my doubts. After his awful first book of course you have doubts as to how Nick got something as good as Killer Student. He got it because he's a good writer. I'm sure you think he's good at a lot of things. Now I want what's mine. So Teresa you're saying this is your work. I'm saying that it has to be mine, given the history Nick and I have. Not to mention my medical bills right now. You know it doesn't have to be yours honey unless you wrote it. No, don't you didn't. Nick did. I'm the only reason he had anything good to write at all. What did you give him? Late Spring Dead Harvest? I like that book. You and nobody else. Certainly not to the taste of a prison book club. Yes, Lana. I did my time. But you're still doing yours as a housewife. Better housewife than murderer. Not in my book, so to speak. Ladies. Please. The First Wife is all yours. Nick! Nick at least let me call the lawyers first. Bravo. Maybe you have learned something. Nick do not make this deal. It's the best I can get right now. Giving up even a part of Killer Student, it would take me forever. If I owe her something, and maybe I really do, this is the easiest thing to do. Drop the assault charges and the book is yours. Deal. I know you didn't mean to attack me like that. Well, Teresa I guess I'll send you contracts from New York next week. Thank you. This ends whatever relationship you think we ever had. Oh Nick there's no need to be so nasty. Get out of my house. Thanks for the bagel! Thank god that's over. And guess what? Before the baby's born, you're going to have a draft of something new. I got a great idea. Excellent. Keep cranking 'em out. Books. Not babies. [laughing] Okay well let me know when you're ready and I'll take you to the airport. I'll take her. Erica wanted to do some shopping before she left. Oh sure. Now that all the excitement's over. Okay. I'll just go write some thoughts down then. Okay let's go shopping. What's the matter? You miss your flight? We have bigger problems. She forced us off the road. I jumped to the final chapter of my book and found your sorry excuse for an ending. I liked the ending. There is no ending. The two lovers just walk away from each other? This isn't a stupid foreign movie. This has to be a New York Times best seller. Okay okay. Just put the gun down and we'll talk. Talk? What I want you to do is write. And you know what they say Nick: The hardest part about writing? It's re-writing. Cozy huh? No wireless, phone, fax. How do you want your eggs? He likes them soft in the middle. Just a trace of cumin. So this is how it's going to work. There's no happy ending unless I get what I want. I will write you an ending. But only if you put down the gun. Make it good, Nicky. Unpredictable. You'll have to do better than that. No stupid talk of murder, you're going to write her an ending, write her a good one. Make the book better. Whose side are you on? The book's. You just want another bestseller. Admit it. So do you. Erica we're missing you. I'm not feeling particularly creative. Okay let's try an exercise. My cell is in my bag in the car. How would your hero get it? Sorry Lana but I need your phone. I will take that. Mama's little helpers, huh? Literally. I'm pregnant. Oh wow. Oh. Well, um, well I'm happy for you. Wonder what my professor would have done if I had been pregnant. If a man's going to leave you, it probably doesn't make any difference. Yeah. You're right actually. My professor saw me the same way Nick did. A young girl only good for one thing. A book. You know I was serious when I said I wanted to read something of yours. Prison diary? Really? Sure. Hang on. There's no lesbian shower scenes here. More like how I felt when I saw Nick on TV plugging Killer Student. Envy. Anger. A lot of feeling there I bet. You have no idea. Life is just one man after another, taking your body, messing with your mind. "A history of abuse," the shrinks say. But at least it was my history. Can I make you something? Sure Mom. How about an omelette? [Keyboard clicking noises playing on computer] [Keyboard clicking noises playing on computer] Hi Daddy. I told you not to play games with me. The gun against her temple felt cold like doctor's instruments. Stop. It's unbearable. The bad girl is not going to kill herself. Well I think you're on the right path Nick. The girl is self-destructive, but I don't think she's suicidal. It has to be better. After all, it is my name on the book. Have you always hated men? Probably. Why did you really kill your professor? I told you. Cumin works wonders. And I told you because you betrayed me. The real reason Teresa. It'll help me with the ending. Do I have to do all the work? Did you kill him because he knew you couldn't write? Easy, Nick. That's why he dumped you, isn't it? Like so many writing students, you were just a dilettante. Afraid of the real work. He got bored of the sex and you panicked because what else could you offer? Get back to your typing. Sleeping with the teacher didn't make you a writer any more than killing him did. My story gave you a best seller and a house for your new family but you won't be able to enjoy any of them, unless you give me what you owe me. Okay. [Phone ringing] You've reached Nick. Leave a message. What city? Langley please. Cook County Sheriff's Office. Please hold while we connect you. Sheriff we got a request for a look-see. Caller says house and cell phones have been out for hours. You know our new policy on that. Caller's the sister of Lana Howarth. Says she doesn't trust the husband. Didn't we hold him last night for assault? We did. I'll go check it out. Teresa I think he's got a good take here. Do you want to hear it? You little bitch. What did you give me? What? Nothing. What did you give me?! I didn't do anything. [Gunshot] Oh my God. Nick! Oh my God. If I kill you, they die too. That's the only way this story works. Shots fired at the Howarth place. Send me back-up. Pronto. On it. I'm not going to ask you again. Blood pressure pills. Move your conniving ass and make me some coffee. Any day now Nicky. I'm finished. It's all done. I'll see about that. It's just a first draft. Alright let's go. Everybody in the living room. Come on. Let's go. We're moving. Now. Why the change in scenery? It's just a little cozier here. Ladies on the couch. It's just the wind. Where's the laptop? In the kitchen. Go get it. [whispering] Thank God you're here. She's got us all held hostage. Teresa? Is anyone hurt? Not yet but she's got a gun on my wife and on my publisher. Nicky! [whispering] Don't let her hurt Lana. I'll go in and distract Teresa. You go around that way. Here it is. The final chapter. I'll be the judge of that. Set it down. [gunshot] Oh my god! Sheriff! Sheriff! These pills! I think you're really going to have an easy pregnancy. No! Give me my gun back! [gunshots] Teresa! Stop! [gunshot] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Nick! You guys okay? Yeah! Help the Sheriff! Get outside! You too, Nick! Now! She is crazy, let's go! Your book is not worth dying over! This isn't about our book. I know you feel responsible for this mess. It's because I am. But you are also responsible for me. Okay? And this child. Let her go, son. We'll get her. You gave her the book. You don't owe her anything more. Yes I do. Go! I just want to talk to you. Well I want to kill you. You don't want to kill me. I'm not your professor. I haven't given up on you. You're exactly like him. [Gunshots] Ah! Nick! Oh no no no! Wait for back-up. Teresa you're wrong. I went to that prison to teach. Not to find a story. All I wanted from you was for you to write. Yeah well you're a lousy teacher. You're right. I'm sorry. I let you down. You just realized this? Could have saved us a lot of time, Nick. But you would have lost a good story. You're right Teresa. I was your teacher. My job was to get you to write your story and I didn't. You're a smart, amusing guy Nick. But I don't love you. I never did, never could. And because I don't love you, I could never kill you. I can't go back to prison. I finished reading what you wrote. It's good. At least I'll die with a good book to my name. How could you do that? Put your fingers on the keyboard. I can't. Fingers on those keys. Please don't do this. I can't. Okay then. [gunshot] Mrs. Howarth. Don't go in there! One page. That's all. I can't. I know what it's like. You have to write but you just can't. It feels like death because it is death. You told me a story about a girl who killed a man who betrayed her. It's a good story, but it's not you. You are not your story. You can tell me another one now. A different one. I don't know another one. Why don't you tell me a story about the girl who could have just killed me but didn't. God, I wanted to. But you didn't. You're not the same girl who killed her teacher. This time, you want the book more than the guy. Come on, you can do this. Okay. But how do I write that? Just start with a character you know. Start with yourself. When success came, he was determined to hang onto it. He was ruthless, even feral about it. As for just a crumb of his pie and he'd crush you. But that didn't scare her. At first she thought it was because she was a victim of his success. After all, he deserved whatever she dished out. Then she realized she wasn't afraid of him because she understood him. In many ways, he was just like her. They were both self-involved. Selfish. Obsessed with success and capable of hurting all those around him. Especially those who were closest and best equipped to help. But these two writers eventually came together and through conflict and competition, taught and learned from each other. The killer student had met a killer teacher and this time, each one walked away a better person. [applause] Yeah. How'd you feel when you saw the dedication? To Nicholas Howarth, an honor student's honorable teacher. I felt I'd earned it. [laughing] You keep in touch with the author? No. Not really. You know, as a writer, after you've learned all you can, after you've studied with all the so-called teachers, at that point it's time to isolate yourself. Lock the doors and just put pen to paper.
