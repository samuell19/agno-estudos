The City of Eindhoven has declared that they will not process the application, because the photo does not meet the legal requirements. This is my religion. This is my belief. I believe that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the earth, the universe, and all of us. I believe in Bobby Henderson, our Prophet. I believe in Bobby Henderson, our Prophet. Today it is a holiday for the pastafarians, believers from The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The chamber of commerce, you have to register there if you have a church organization, did you succeed? The Chamber of Commerce in my home town welcomed the church with open arms and said: "Who is to say that the Flying Spaghetti Monster did not create heaven and earth?" At the head office, however, they did not agree. They just said "this is not a religion, and that is that." Now the tension mounts. Now comes what is real belief. I know it. I feel it. Yes, I have a Noodle faith, I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, I am a Pastafarian. I always wear pirate head gear to save the climate. We have 30 million members worldwide. In Uckermark, I have founded the German Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster, a recognized association. We celebrate noodle masses, and we baptize our children with noodle water. Our marriages are recognized on the same grounds as other church marriages. And in heaven a beer volcano and a stripper factory await us. Find out what really Happened on Christmas The Flying Spaghetti Monster educates you... In Germany it is, in fact, not allowed to wear head gear on official IDs. He went to renew his driver's license and said, "this is my religious head gear," and they accepted the photo. And now we can see him on his driver's license photo with his head gear. Pastafari! The Pastafarian Rudiger Weida with us On Tell The Truth. Apparently the road authority, in an illegal action just like a pirate, took these signs down. We want to have the same rights as other religious communities and to reach that goal we are going to court because currently we can't. Do you view Pastafarianism as a religion, or a worldview? I see it as a religion. The Mayor does not think The Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster is a religion like Islam and Sikhism are religions. A pirate called "Mosey" came down from a mountain with eight tablets. Well... he came with ten, dropped two, and had eight remaining tablets. Yes, that is one of the stories in the holy books of this religious movement. It looks as if the court now wishes to review, somehow, the truth of this religion? If you look at the beginning of their holy book "Loose Canon"... dedicated to St. John the Blasphemist. So yes, I think these questions are relevant, in the context of this belief. You can call it a religion when there is a certain level of understandability, seriousness, cohesiveness and importance. A profound cooperation between a group of people with the same beliefs that also put these into practice. There should be seriousness and provable importance. The movement of The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster can not deliver this. It is clearly a parody of religion. In the letter from Bobby Henderson, and in the holy text "Loose Canon" there is no mention of wearing colanders, only of, "full pirate regalia". If we take a look at a "Spaghetti Monster Prayer", here we have a small part: Our pasta who art in a colander. "And lead us not into vegetarianism, but deliver us some pizza, for thine is the meatball, the noodle, and the sauce." It's the meatballs, and the beer, and in another version the noodles, and strippers, and in another version, the sauce. They use the word "R'Amen", a type of pasta, in place of "Amen". This is NOT an understandable, serious, cohesive, important religion or worldview. In 2005, Christian fundamentalists in the USA succeeded in having creationism taught alongside Darwin's Theory of Evolution in biology classes, not religion classes. That caught the attention of many people. The argument was that it can do no harm if our children learn about yet another theory. A young scientist was enlightened... The Flying Spaghetti Monster had revealed Himself to him and told him His story. The next day he wrote to this school board and asked them to include The Flying Spaghetti Monster in biology classes as well. This letter was shared widely across the internet. Freedom of religion once came into place to protect smaller religions from the often violent efforts to convert by the bigger, more powerful religions. In this case, things seem to be turned around. As the Mayor implied in his statement, the established religions need to be protected against this newcomer, for they find it odd, unbelievable, and thus offensive. Is this really how freedom of religion is meant to be? When every aspect in a religion has to be serious then which type of religion qualifies, other than the extreme fundamentalist? Is it a dogma that they criticize other religions? The Pastafarians criticize other religions insofar as they waste money that could have been used for the good of the community, despise and promote violence against non-members... Accepting your own shortcomings and those of others, and how to deal with that in loving and forgiving manner. Thus using humor and satire. So what is... I'm still stuck on this satire... Where is the seriousness here? This satire is actually used to attract modern people in a new way. Nowadays, preaching the old-fashioned way is no longer effective.
