I'll be thirty next month. I'm graduated, have a good job.. My loved ones are all healthy.. What are u thinking of? Their expression. I've been with her for 3 years, I thought she was the woman of my life and we moved in together. Time passed by, though, Time always passes by. And it's not nice, but I got bored. I felt something was missing.. ..but what? Excuse me.. ..we've got something to say.. What's missing? We're having a baby. Aw, my child.. ..baby, that's wonderful.. Hey, why do you have those expressions? We must celebrate! My heart's beating so fast.. We have to toast! Just a minute, ok? Don't say anything till I'm back! - I knew that. - Really? It'll be a wonderful experience. Carlo, this is going to be a turning point in your life. I know.. Dad, don't you say anything? I need a few minutes, it was a shock.. Ok, but tell me if you're happy, at least.. I'm happy if you are. I am happy! I'm very happy! She's very happy! Then I'm happy too. Will you get married now? We still don't know. - You don't know? - Actually we're still thinking about that. And we already live together, what changes if we get married? Well, marriage is a way to protect your child.. You got divorced when I was 3 and yet protected me, didn't you? I only found a bottle of champagne and it's not even cool enough, but we don't care, do we? Here, love, open it up. I was never good at that. Above all on these occasions.. - To you! - And to whom will call us "grannies"! Grannies? Shall I be a granny too? My God.. My God, I've never thought about it.. THE LAST KISS Your cousin no longer looks the same. My cousin's body is different from yours. And Silvia? Silvia's had two children, and her body's different too. She looks like a whale. Love, her second child's just been born. Listen, I read that only 5 out of 10 women reach their previous shape. What if I become a whale and you don't like me anymore? I will always like you. - Will you? - I will! With cellulitis, with insecurity, with the butt of an elefant, I will always like you. My love, you're so beautiful! What did I do to be worthy of you.. I'm getting ugly. - Did you get what I said? - Yes. Could you switch off the TV when I speak to you? Why? Because we never speak. Please, don't start again.. Tonight something terrible happened. I envied my daughter.. ..because she still has a whole life to live. Because her man still looks at her like that, because she's still so far from monotony, but what do you know about that? You, who have always been monotonous? You are monotonous, and always repeat yourself. - I learnt from you. - I am when I'm not stimulated. - Hah! - Hah! You talk about being stimulated? You, who haven't touched me for ages.. Maybe I've nothing good to touch anymore. God, I'm so unhappy! I'm so unhappy! The problems start when you go home and there's 3 of you: you, her and the baby. She'll get totally nuts and make you feel like an idiot with everything you can't give her. And she'll expect a thousand things from you, suddenly. You'll be accused of being irresponsible, of being a bad father.. Remember today's meeting. - We must destroy them! - Ok! Jerk! Don't ever think it's gonna be easy, cause it won't be at all. - Understood? - Yes. - I want to leave him. - You said that many times. I always wake up with him, sleep with him, live with him.. ..get mad at him, fall asleep with him.. I want to start over. I feel this is the right time. He wakes up crying every 2 hours, because he needs feeding, cleaning up and putting back to sleep. How long do you lull him? From 10 to 40 minutes, but if he's got air in his stomach it will be an hour. Then, when he's finally asleep he gets hungry again and it starts over. This is the general picture. Hey, I don't mean to scare you, but you must know in 6 months you'll be suddenly old. And when you wonder if there's a way out, and you will wonder, the answer is no, there's no way out. Apart from escape. Dave wrote to us. He's asking if he and Christopher can be our guests for 2 weeks in May. In May there's going to be the baby. In fact I replied that we can't. I'm going out. Will you be late? Yes, but not too late.. Love, it's for Marco who'll get married soon.. It's a special occasion.. - See you love. - See you. It's for me! How old is he? More or less like us. - How long have they broken up? - Maybe six months. She stays with someone else now? No, not yet, I mean she had an affair but it's over. Now she's looking for someone to fall in love with. Who isn't looking for someone to fall in love with? Those who are in love. They're already set.. To us! To what we were and what we shall be! And to what we'll never be! And to what we'll never be! And to that bitch! I hope she pays for everything! And to all the bitches who betrayed us, and to those who will! Fuck off!! And to your wedding! Which however is a mistake!! Shut up, you can't speak as you have a baby! If you had guts you wouldn't get married! Why? If Arianna got back and asked you to marry her, - Wouldn't you? - I wouldn't. Good!! I'll tell her to go to hell! Michele? Here we are, sorry for being late. - I was just getting accustomed to the party. - See? I finally brought her to you. You're the famous.. Not famous at all.. Anna. Nice to meet you. Michele. I told her everything about you. Great. So if she runs away while I'm speaking, I'll know why. I saw someone I know, be right back. Is that it? It is. You guys are crazy.. They thought that contemporary art.. Should get rid of the past and get deep into contemporary world. That's why they were so lively and exuberant, and always evolving. I was born among pictures. - My father was a famous art reviewer. - Was he? - How's things with your husband? - What? The hull of the boat is perfect, it's all that matters. It just needs a few adjustments. It's a 1969 Wing it goes like a sword on the sea. We go coast to coast along Greece and get to Istanbul, and from there we can reach anywhere. It's important for us not to be in a haste, and I'm not. - But isn't the boat your uncle's too? - My uncle never cared for that boat. If I ask him, he'll give it to me. Come on, let's leave together! You must be crazy.. Once you're there with the sea and the sky and nothing else, you'll tell me if I'm crazy. I don't want to spend my whole life in the same place. Neither do I. None of us does, guys. Hey! Wait for me! So you moved? I bought a coach and put it in my father's office, I live there now. Do you like it? So and so.. It's not easy for anyone to break up after 18 years. I figure that. Listen, would you come and drink something at my place? It's near here. We drink something, chat a little.. If you want.. - But I drank too much.. - Come on.. And what with Luisa? Tell her I'll take you home.. Come on, you can see her any time, while we could never meet again.. What's wrong with that? Hey, we're Taurus and Pisces, the perfect union.. To find out the meaning of life you have to escape and get back.. ..change, have sex every night, try everything.. What the hell are we still doing here.. I'm going to leave, I made up my mind. - You have for 10 years, enough now. - No, this time I'm serious. I quit my job, haven't been to the shop for two weeks now. What the.. 3, 2, 1, bungee!! It's so cool!!!!! I don't think I can make it.. This is one of the last few pieces left from my father's collection. I made another gin and tonic. My head is spinning. Just a little.. Why are you staring at me? You're very charming, Anna. And gorgeous. Wait! - I've got some cocaine.. - Aw.. Only a little. I've never had cocaine. Neither have I, I mean only once. I found it in my son's room. I told him if I caught him with this stuff I'd chase him out of the house. And in the end I was chased out, instead. C'est la vie. Come on, come near me. What would my wife say if she saw me with you? - What would she say? - Hey, take it easy! I'm unhappy, Anna. Unhappy and lonely. I lost my wife and I can't forget her. What should I do? Can you tell me? Listen, I don't think you should be with me now. I don't think you want it, like I don't. Will you take me home? - You want to leave? - Hum. If you don't want to take me I'll call a taxi. No.. No cocaine? No cocaine. I'm making a mistake, I know that! Relax, it's all under control! Stay cool and show some pride! Jump and don't think about it! Think of when you'll be a poor right-minded man. Think of that and jump! Ready! You have to get mad! - Are you mad? - No! - You have to be! Are you mad? - No! 3.. 2.. 1.. bungee! He's still alive! What's the time? 3:00 am. Did you have fun? Why don't you love me anymore? You didn't have fun. I want to lift a glass to my son and his beautiful wife. Be happy! Say something! Say something! Okay, - I'm very emotioned.. - Bravo! And then.. ..first of all thank you for coming here, I want to dedicate this day to the woman I wanted to marry when I first saw her, even before knowing her name, it wasn't easy for me to win her, because she thought I was unreliable and superficial.. She was right! ..on the contrary, I can say this, she will never say she was right. - Never. - Bravo Marco! He's a great man! Kiss her! Kiss her! - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Honey don't, daddy'll be right back. What a cute baby, what's her name? Matteo. It's a boy. - What shall we tell her? - We'll think of something.. Alberto! - Hi, how are you? - I'm ok. We haven't seen each other for a while, have we? Yeah. - It's weird for us to meet here isn't it? - Yeah.. Listen, I have to go to.. - I thought about you recently. - Really? Yes. I think I still have your number somewhere. Maybe one of these days we can go out. - Ok. - See you, then. - See you. - I'll call you. Ok. - Bye. - Bye. Where the hell did I see her before? Cute. I had sex with him on a night when we were both high.. When I went home I even threw up my own soul, But if I had the chance I'd go with him again. The hell if I would. Arianna? Can I talk to you for a second? - Is that ok? - Yes, thank you. You know it's bad for him to see you. There are many people, he won't notice I'm here. What do you want? Why should I hide? - You don't have to hide. - It's what you're asking me. You said you'd only come to the ceremony. - I changed my mind. - It's really bad for him. Things were bad for him also before he met me. - But now it's worse. - Please, leave. Do you realise what you're asking me? He saw us. Your friends are worried about you, They're trying to send me away. You said you wouldn't come here. I was invited and changed my mind. What's the problem? The problem is yours, as you can't stand seeing me, Paolo. - Forget it. - Paolo! Listen, I need to feel clean again. If you don't disappear I can't. Am I asking too much? Yes. Why are you such a bitch? You want me to kill myself? Is that what you want? - Calm down. - You want to see me dead? I wish you didn't come here, Arianna. I wish you didn't come here too, then. Why don't you take him away? You hate me, don't you. I don't. I only regret the fact we met. Because you're getting more and more unbearable, ruining the last nice things which still remained between us. It's over, Paolo. Pretend we never met and go on living your life. - Paolo, calm down! - Paolo! - I'm calm, let go of me! - Paolo! You're cutting a poor figure! Stop it! Stop it. Let's go back to our table. I've got to stop thinking about that bitch. I've got to stop. You have. Good. Kiss her! Kiss her! You're laughing now.. I want to see you in 2 years. No, good boy, good boy.. He had no problems before you moved him, now he looks scared! Love, come to mommy, my love, come to mommy! Did daddy scare you? - It's not my fault! - It's always your fault! You never listen to me, I told you not to move him! - Can I come too? - Yes, please. How long can I keep standing her? How long? He's egoist and selfish, he's got my father's defects! I could never get along with my father.. But maybe things aren't easy for him.. Things aren't easy for anyone, Giulia, but we're no longer kids. It's time for him to take his own responsabilities. It doesn't take much to take care of this little thing.. Look at him.. When he feels protected he lets himself go, he gets relaxed.. Don't you, love? It has to be an incredible experience.. It's the most beautiful thing in the world. What are you having? What? I still don't know. Have we already met before? Apart from today? Why? Cause I feel like we have.. I don't really think so. Maybe we haven't. - By the way I'm Francesca. - Carlo. Have you seen the hut? - The hut? - Yes, the hut in the trees. No. Do you want to see it? You only have to push. The better you push the earlier they come out. There are also lessons about that, you better go there because if you don't push properly, for example if you push too hard, you can end like my sister, whose capillary vessels exploded and her face was all purple for a week. Yuck! Here it is. Isn't that cool! It is! - Shall we go up? - Yes. Follow me! So you're a friend of the groom? Yes, we went to university together. The 2 of us and another guy, Adriano, don't know if you know him. Where are you from? Firenze? Near there. My parents moved here three years ago. And I followed them. What should I do? They wouldn't let me stay there by myself. Cool, isn't it? We see everyone and no one can see us. Cool, yes. Hey can I ask if you have a girlfriend? - Why? - Just asking. Yes, kind of. - Problems? - Yes, problems. Gee, everyone has problems, whomever you ask. But why? Who knows.. By the way problems come and go, don't they? - Yes. - Do yours come or go? Mine come. I knew that.. How come? I don't know. There has to be a reason.. I guess that passion is almost over. Then that's the reason.. Also that. By the way it's not uncommon for passion to be over after some time. Okay, but that's sad, isn't it? It is. - What's your job? - I work for an advertising agency. Really? I want to be an actress. When I finish school I want to go to the drama school. - School? - Yes, Classical School. - How old are you? - Eighteen. - Eighteen? - Do I look younger? - No, older. - How old did you think I was? I don't know, honestly. How old are you? - Don't ask, please.. - Twenty-seven? - 29, almost 30 and it sucks. - Why? Because when you're 30 you'll be 40 soon, - and you think of you life and.. - Sorry.. Hello? Ok, I'll be right there. Too bad I came here with 3 idiots, who already wanted to go home 2 hours ago. How about seeing each other again? Sorry? Only if you want.. I do. Shall we go down? As you prefer. All my friends are married but me.. "You're 32, when are you getting married?".. .."When are you having a baby? If you don't have one now you.." The hell with it. I was with someone who didn't even let me go out with my friends for 10 years. Now I want to enjoy my freedom. That's good. - It is.. - By the way I'm Alberto. - Where are they? - Here, I think. Can I leave you my number? Yes. Have you got a pen? - Sorry, I haven't. - Francesca! It's them.. Listen, come and see me when I go out of "Liceo Ducale". - "Liceo Ducale". - Yes. Lessons finish at 1:30, but on Wednesday and Friday I'm out at half past twelve. Ok. Ok, sounds good to you? - Yes. - I'll be waiting for you then? Yes. - Ok, ciao. - Ciao. Hey, say "cheese"! - You look beautiful! - You too! - Have you seen Carlo? - No. If she's with him I'll kill him. - You gotta calm down. - No, I swear I'll kill him! - Take it easy! - I'll kill him! Don't be so sure, because I'm dangerous.. Are you? Yes, many men could tell you that. - I'm not scared. - Aren't you? - No. - Hey! Wow, you don't waste your time.. It's your fault as you're so beautiful.. Honey! I was looking for you, where were you? I was here. Honey.. Have you seen how cute Adriano's child is? Do you realise that we are having a baby too? Aren't you emotioned? Yes. What are you thinking about? You're thinking you'd like to run to her and say it was good to meet her. It really was. Hey, say "cheese".. But then you remember you'll become a father in a few months. And those aren't nice thoughts. Here you are at last. Your father asked about you. He keeps asking. How is he? You'll regret what you're doing. - I won't. - Don't yell at me. Go to say hi to him. Hi dad. It's Paolo. Do you want to say hi to him? Paolo.. Earlier today he asked if you returned to the shop. Tell him you did. I did, dad. I went to the shop. It's all right, dad, don't get worried, understand, dad? Shame on you! You're making a fool of everyone. - Shut up. - Why? Because I made up my mind. - It's not what he wanted for you. - Please.. - There has to be a reason. - There is a reason! What is it? I need to give a meaning to my life. At least one meaning. But what do you know about that.. Why are you staring at me? What would you do if i died? I'd buy a nice black suit. I'm serious. Would you miss me or look for another wife, maybe younger, who could stand your silence? Would you look for someone as boring as you? Why do you have to poison my blood all the time? I want to leave you, and this time I will. - You will? - Yes. You can't live without me. - I can't? - No. Not because you're as weak as you think.. Then why? Let's hear the professor. Because you still love me. I wouldn't be so sure. It's a pity. You'd live a better life if you admitted it. By the way I made up my mind. From now on you and I are no longer together. - Understood? - Yes. And? - I don't agree. - I don't care! It's for me. Did you understand? I don't care if you don't agree! Hello? It's me. - What do you want? - Stay calm. - I just want to apologise for today. - I don't want to know. - Can I come there? - No. Why not? Is there anyone with you? - Yes. - What are you doing? - Please. - Tell me! You want to know if we've just had sex? - Have you? - Yes. Alright? Do you feel better? What else do you want to know? What? You lost your voice? No. Next time you better think twice before you call me. Do you ever think of me while you're having sex with him? You're crazy! Yes, I'm going crazy! Listen, I'm going away for a while, till I feel better. This time I'm leaving for real. Sounds like a good idea idea. It does? One thing for sure, you can't go on like this. No, I can't. Listen Paolo, one last thing: don't call me anymore. But where did I go wrong? Adriano? You've been in there for 20 minutes. All's well? Adriano, answer to me! Adriano? I'm fine! Then get out and help me! I need you, Matteo is hungry. Come out and help me! Adriano! - What am I supposed to do? - What do you think? Love, come to mummy who'll feed you. And don't ever ask me to follow you to parties, weddings and so on, again. Tonight this child won't let us sleep. - Will you put him back to sleep? - Of course I will. You don't ever hear him! But why am I saying that? It's like speaking to a wall! Look, I've already renounced you as a partner, but he deserves a better father than you. - Does he? - Yes he does! You know what, Livia. - What? - I don't love you anymore. I don't, on the contrary, when I see you in bed in the morning I get sad! You've changed since he was born. - I don't recognise you! - Neither do I! Honestly, I thought you were a bit better! - You did? - I did! Fine! Great! - I'm going out, don't look for me! - Who'll look for you.. Get lost! Adriano, if you go out I'll get mad, understand? As if you never do.. Adriano! Your dad is an asshole! - Who's that? - A neighbour! - Make room! - Hey! Don't speak! - Why did you come here? - I don't know! I came to tell you that months will pass, years will pass, Maybe you'll hate me forever, or maybe one day you'll change your mind. Iif you do, I'll be here waiting. I'll always be waiting for you! - You're crazy! - Listen, I can't live without you! - I can't! I love you! - Let go of her! I love you. Have you ever felt like I do? You have to try that to understand. - But what are you doing half naked? - Paolo, get out. - You want me to leave? - Yes. Okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. In this period, even the strongest women can get very emotional, anxious and worried, in a way which seems exagerated to others. It's better not to keep everything inside. Speak about fear, is a way to feel less scared. Or at least not to panic. Did you understand? Yes, it says you don't have to keep everything inside. Honey.. What if we buy a house instead of paying for this rent? What? Come.. come together.. Come! Don't worry about that. - Who's that! - Alberto! - What the f.. - It's me! Who's that? A friend of mine, don't worry it's alright.. - Alberto open the door!! - Wait! No, I can't go on sorry.. Ok, I'll see what he wants and get back. - Okay? - What about me? Wait here, I'll be right back. I'm coming! It's over! This time it's really over! - I can't stand her anymore! - Did you two fight again? You have a good job. If we bought a house we'd spend as much as for the rent. What do you think? I think.. I'm a bit scared of the idea of settling down. We'll be a family soon, it's an important thing.. - I know it's important. - What's the problem then? We haven't made love for 7 months. Once I even called her "mom". It was terrible. If there wasn't the baby you two would broke up. No, the baby is wonderful, it's her who has changed. But why has she changed? She became like all the other hyperprotective mothers. - Why? - I have no clue! Hello? I'll be there in a bit. Hello? - Alberto? - Who's that? Ciao, I'm Gemma. Listen to this: Restored cottage, parquet floors, 100 square metres, in the Cassia area, two bathrooms, 30 square metres garden. We could also get a dog. Garage, storeroom, 900 million lire. That's a bit too much maybe.. Will you come to the school tomorrow? What do you think, honey? You will or you won't? - What? - What? Hey, what happened? Pass me that. - Hi. - She's Gemma. - I decided to leave. - Sure.. Don't tell me "sure", or I'll get mad. This time I'm serious. And you? Why are you here at this hour? - You fought with Livia again. - I can't stand her anymore. She's irritating, I've always told you that, and you're unhappy. Don't say you're happy or I'll have a stroke with laughter. You aren't happy at all! You should leave everything and come with me! - And you too! - What? Have you looked at you? You wanted to work for Greenpeace. Now you make pirated cd-roms and have sex with a new girl every night. And keep telling us there's something you miss, after all. What will you find if you go on like that? You want to be pathetic and frustrated at 50, lonely and with a tuft of fake hair? You're leaving with me and that's all. I don't have sex with a new girl every night.. He does, darling. Sorry. You better know these things at the beginning. He said that only to embarass me. Ok, but I don't care cause I do the same. Wonderful, you're soulmates then. What? I know I've said that for ages, but I can't take it anymore now, I really can't. I'll go insane if I stay here. We leave now or never. We aren't 20, but not even 40, luckily. Because when you're 40 life is over, we've always known that. I need to forget my father's disease, I need to ferget that bitch, and I want to stay away for a while. That's all. What's wrong with that? Am I asking too much? I'm just asking to leave. Are you coming with me? Have you ever wanted to betray me? You need to think about it? I dont need to think about it.. Then what? The answer is no. Why not? Because I'm in love with you. What if someone else attracts you? Why should that be? - Because it could happen. - Maybe to you, not to me. Yes, but I know it won't happen to me. Why? Because I'm stronger than you. I've always been and I'll always be. And if I ever find out you betray me, I'll kill you. Understood? Yes. You can sleep now, honey, you look tired. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Are you done? It's too late for Marco, but it's not for you and Carlo. - Okay but when should we leave? - As soon as possible. - We take the boat and go toTurkey. - Wait for me! We can go to volunteer in Africa, we can open a scuba dive school in Polinesia, or return to Patagonia.. Whatever we do, we'll never get sad. Some may say we're three jerks. Jerks is better than unhappy, remember that. The trick is not to think about it, otherwise we'll never leave, and when we're 60 we'll be our fathers' clones. And if we think of what we could do.. ..shit.. ..and we didn't do, we'll get sad and hate ourselves, - because it'll be too late. - But how much do we need? In Tanzania you live 2 years with 10 millions. Here it's gone in 5 months and you're always mad. Once abroad, we decide whether to go on or come back. Shall I ask for temporary retirement? Ask for temporary retirement at work. Here you have a house, an irritating wife and a son, but you know there's only one thing you can do.. - Leave. - Yes, leave! We just have to decide. - You're all dead inside! - Fuck off! Yes, fuck off! - Fuck off! - Fuck off! - Okay. The hell with it, let's leave! - Yes! - Fuck off! - Yes! I can't leave him all by myself. I need to see Eugenio again. - Eugenio? - Yes. - You haven't seen him for 2 years.. - Almost three. Anna, you need to start over, with no regrets. It's the most important relationship I had since married. - You didn't have other ones. - Yes, thats why. If I have to start somewhere, I prefer to start from that. I still dream of him sometimes. It has to mean something. Bulgari, good morning. ..and as it's not its taste to make it different but its density, we thought of a slogan for the whole campaign, which will also work as a teaser, "So creamy you swallow it as a whole". So creamy you swallow it as a whole.. After 2 months of advertising we'll reveal it's the ice-cream "Regina" - It's going to be sensational. - For sure. Hi uncle. Here you are at last! Where have you been? I've been waiting for you for two weeks. I'm not coming back here. I thought about it and I made up my mind. I don't want to go on working here, there's not much more to be said. - This is also your shop. - I know. What the heck are you saying, then? Listen, I need to give a meaning to my life. Some people were born to sell religious objects, ..and others were born to say bullshit, like you. Are you on drugs? Come on.. Come on what? And what's this sense of superiority? You come here and treat me like an idiot.. Things aren't like that and you'll see. Okay. Your place is here where your father put you. - Stop being so insolent. - No. It's your duty! I'm talking about your responsabilities. Alright? This is our shop, it's all we have. Well, evidently it's not enough for me. - Aw, it's not enough for you.. - No, it's not. If your father wasn't sick you wouldn't talk to me like that. If my father wasn't sick I'd tell him these things. - You would? - Yes. Please do, then. He's still able to understand, what do you think? But you don't do that. And do you know why? Because you're a sissy! And so you come to me, but there's nothing I can do for you. I can only try and make you think carefully. You can allow me to have our boat repaired. I want to have it repaired and leave by it. I'll do that at my own expenses. I need it for a while. I want to take it to Turkey. You father and I sacrificed our lives for this shop. I can drive boats, you don't have to worry. - I feel so sorry for you.. - Listen, I feel sorry for you instead. - You do? - Yes, I do. That'll be all, then. And, please, do me a favour, leave immediately. Go away! Go. No boat, I guess? What's the matter? Paolo, Alberto and I had an idea. - I want your opinion. - Ok. What is it? Okay, I'll tell you when you're back. When are you coming back? I don't know, sorry. Giulia? Honey, I just wanted to remind you, I have an echography in half an hour. I completely forgot. But I reminded you that last night.. Don't tell me you can't take me there now.. Please say you'll be right here, okay? Okay. - I'll be waiting. Bye. - Bye. - Ciao. - Ciao. I was passing by and saw you. So you didn't come here for me.. No, but I swear I would in a few days. - Liar.. - I swear. Want a lift? I'm in a haste, but I'll drive you anywhere. My house is really close. - I'll drive you home, come on. - It's really close. I'll drive you there, really. It's good to see you. For me too. - Where to? - Go straight ahead. Okay. What happened at the wedding? Did you have fun? I've never liked weddings. Why? Because they're a show for good intentions, eternal love and passion, smiles.. ..after 2 years you have your lawyer speak to hers in the court. Not if you meet the right person. Stop, it's right here. - Ok. - That's my house. - It was really close. - I told you. To be disillusioned is bad. How can you fall in love if you don't hope for it to last forever? - Don't you agree? - Yes. - Is that yours? - Yes, sorry. - A message? - Yes. HURRY UP, LOVE - Sorry, I have to go. - Okay. Would you come to a party tomorrow? It's a birthday party of a friend of mine. If you're free we can go together. How about it? - How about it? - Yes. That'll be great. - Okay, I'll leave you my numbers. - Okay. What would you do if I did that? Okay, call me tomorrow at this hour and we'll make agreements. - Don't disappoint me, ok? - No. - Bye. - Bye. What the hell are you doing here.. - It's so late.. - I'm here, I'm ready. - Let's go. - Let's go. Stop here please. How much is it? Can I ask you for something? Yes. What was it, only sex, or you also love me a bit? I also love you a bit. I knew that. Does Professor Bonetti teach here? Yes, he's in the class. - Ok, what time is he going out? - 3:30 pm. Thanks. Francesca? Come to eat, I've called you 3 times already. Francesca? There are 90 % probabilities that its a girl. 90%. A girl.. My God, honey.. Just follow your heart, There are no tactics, strategies, couter-attacks which work in life.. In love only destiny matters. - But is he really so cute? - He's beautiful. Sorry I left my phone on.. Shall I answer it? Giulia.. Giulia? Mommy it's a girl, she's beautiful, she's healthy! It's fantastic! It's fantastic! An incredible emotion! My God, I'm so happy.. I'm going to call dad to tell him too. See you later. Bye! Hello? It was my daughter, - She said she's having a girl.. - I'm glad to see you. Me too. So many feelings together.. I hope they aren't too many? Now that I'm here and can look you in the eye, it's like we've never stopped seeing each other. You don't know how often I think of you.. So do I.. Really? You know I do. No, I don't. Say it again. - Did you really miss me? - Yes. - Yes, I did... - Honey, my love.. I'm so happy to see you again! Why did you disappear like that? Let's change subject, please. No, let's talk about it. - Why did you disappear like that? - You know. I want you to tell me. Because I thought that if we stopped seeing each other I would have a chance to save my marriage. - And did you make it? - No, I can't say I did. No. Anyway it's all in the past. Now the important thing is I'm here. Don't you think? I'm with another woman now. Is she important for you? What does important mean? Do you love her? Are you in love with her? We have a child. Yes. He turned 1 two days ago. You have a child.. Who is 1 year old.. What am I to say then? I'm having a granddaughter.. And you have a 1 year old son.. This is life, and so much more, isn't it? Does he look like you? I waited for you for so long.. Don't tell me.. I hoped for months for you to call me and say you found the courage to leave him. Months. You don't know how many times I tried.. But you couldn't.. It's your fault. But.. don't you feel for me anymore? My life has changed. Why? Because we haven't met for 3 years? Because you stay with another? Because you have a child? Why? That too. I'm asking stupid questions, aren't I? You think I'm pathetic, don't you? Look.. By the way I must tell you.. ..if we could go back I'd follow you everywhere. I could leave him right now. I would, I'm much stronger now. It's too late. You say that because our years' difference can be seen now, don't you? How old is your woman? Is she a girl? - Do you stay with a girl, Eugenio? - Why don't you take it easy? Of course. I have to take it easy, I have to calm down, also because this situation is getting pathetic and out of control. See you. But I have to tell you I've loved you for all this time. I loved you too, Anna. Would you like to have sex with me again? Anna.. No, forget it, Forget about that. I'll be able to start a new life, you'll see. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye. Please don't move. - Will it hurt? - A little. Are you ready? - Yes. - Okay. Hey! - Does it hurt so much? - Very much.. Good morning madam. - Is my husband with someone? - Yes. It doesnt' matter. You can't disturb him now.. I'm still his wife. I can do what I want. - He'll get mad! - He'll get mad at me. Hello. What happened? Nothing, in your opinion, right? - I'm working. - I can see that. Then go away and come back in 40 minutes, when I'm done. I need to talk to you. Couldn't you talk to me in 40 minutes, - or later at home? - No. She's my wife, don't worry. I have to tell you right now! Wow, I'm so scared.. - I'm provoking a reaction! - You drank, didn't you? You ask if I drank? I'm leaving you, my dear! Did you understand? I'm leaving you forever! Alright.. Get out now! Out! I betrayed you! Did you get that? I betrayed you! Goodbye and sorry for disturbing you. Wait a minute.. Wow, what a vehemence! The first time in 30 years! What's this story? It happened 3 years ago. I saw him again today. If he'd asked me to follow him everywhere, I would have done that! - I hope it's not true! - It is, unfortunately. How does it feel? It's real life. Don't you say anything? You can't? Are you hating me or not feeling anything as usual? Hey? I'm here! Can you see me? Can you hear me? You've never done anything to save our marriage! I'm wordless! We'll talk about it later! Sure! Because you have something better to do, - than your private life! - Correct! Correct? What's correct, Emilio? You don't know what you're saying. There's nothing correct in our lives. I've felt lonely for all this time! Don't raise your voice! That's why I betrayed you! - I don't want to know! - I liked it too! - He's great in bed at least! - Shut up! That's not normal, you're falling ill! - No, it's not normal. - It's not normal, you're falling ill! I'm trying to feel alive, not like you, who are dead and don't know that! What should I do? What did you want? Teen-age passion? Get pregnant with a young husband in a love hut? What did you want from me? We had our life together! And it wasn't so bad as you keep saying. I'm full of good memories! - Lucky you! - You're ruining everything, instead! What are you doing! - Calm down! - I want to break everything! You need to dipend on someone, so you can tell him he stole you freedom. You're a cactus with too many thorns! Yes! A cactus with too many thorns! I don't know what the hell it means, but that's exactly how I see you! - Fine! - Yes! We agree to that then! We do! Where's the way out! Where's the way out! Hello? Today I left your father. What happened? This time it's forever. I'm going to stay at Luisa's place. Call me on my cell phone, my child. Call me whenever you like. I'm happy for you and for the child you have inside. I'm happy, not envious. I'm happy, I'm happy. Luisa? Mom? ..suddenly the mattress starts swelling and tries to suffocate me, so I jump out of the window in order to escape and I see my husband behind me. He's trying to reach me, "Stop" he says, but I fly away and can't stop. It means I want to get back to him and I can't? Or that I want to leave and I'm scared? We'll cross the Sahara, then go through Chad, Central Africa, Congo, Zambia, Botswana, then boom! Capetown. Once we're there we'll decide whether to get back or reach Australia. Capetown - Sydney takes 18 days' sailing, it's not so much. But how long will it take to cross Africa? Whatever it takes.. It can take three months or three years.. - Of course. - You've got to learn to relax. It's the philosophy of travelling. I feel like when I left home for the first time. You'll get used to that. This is your last occasion to start a new life. Anna, only when we die it's too late. Okay. We can do as those Danish guys in Mikonos who reached Copenaghen by bike. What? You can't cross Africa by bike! Then let's go by motorbike. A big and powerful motorbyke costs 10 million lire. That's 30 milions for the 3 of us.. Then we can buy an off-road Camper. We can go everywhere, sleep inside it and not spend a cent. It's her, dam it. - Yes. - Are you going to be late? You said you didn't care for my presence anymore? Please, Adriano, I need to find some peace. When are you coming home? I also need you to buy some milk cause it's finished, and Matteo will be hungry in half an hour. I'll be right there. Ok, I'll be waiting. Ok. Bye. Who sells those campers? Honey! Come here! Honey, I can't go on like this anymore. We have to find a way to start loving each other again. Understand? Understand? - But what have you done? - What have I done? You had youself pierced? So what? When did you do that? You're completely crazy! Why, you don't like it? It sucks. Have you looked at you? How can we ever start loving each other again? How the hell can we? And take this milk! It's never too late if you want something, understand? If you wanted it, we could! But you don't want it anymore. And that piercing sucks! You look like a jerk! - You know what? - What? I'm seriously thinking of leaving. You could introduce me to your friends.. After all we are almost together, aren't we? I don't think so. Why not? Why are you so scared of settling down? Do you see other girls besides me? No. I don't believe you want to leave. Do you really want to leave me? Yes. Why? Because we aren't happy together anymore. It won't be easy for me to leave the kid, but this isn't my place anymore. It's so evident. What else do you want to hear? Are you thinking of me? I'll look for a job. Start over, rent a house. - But you're too old for that.. - Again with this fact I'm old! - Mom, be sensible! - I am! My life fell into pieces, the damage is done. What should I do, give up? I won't! But was this other man so important? - He was. - But now it's over. It's all that matters. Everyone can be betrayed once in a lifetime, dad will understand, I'm sure. Do you really think I'm too old to start a new life? Do you think I'm old? How old would you think I am if you didn't know? Exactly your age. - It's not so old.. - Not even young though. You never say anything nice to me. Mom, you two have been together for a lifetime. You're going to need each other more and more.. Don't ruin everything now. Hello? This is Carlo. Hey, how are you? I'm studying, where are you? I'm at the Sothens'. Where? At the agency. And what's its name? So.. what? Sothens & Sothens'. Listen, I just called to say that we can see each other tonight if you want. Tonight? Yes, at the party.. Okay. How are we going to meet? I don't know.. Would you take me there? Sure. Okay, do you remember where I live? Of course. Okay then. Yes, it's fine. - I'll be waiting for you. - Okay. Okay, fantastic, ciao. Ciao. I'll tell Giulia I'm going out with you. No, you know I can't tell lies. Leave it be, I'll mess it up. Adriano, I need to feel alive again. Understand me. I never betrayed Livia. You know what I think? I think that's why you're about to explode. Tell Mr. Bonardi I can't right now. If he can call me in 5 minutes.. Do I have 5 minutes to try and save your marriage? Why do you care for this matter so much? You have your own life, we have ours. What's the problem? Dad, I don't want you 2 to break up. I often think of her the same bad things she tells me. But you still love each other. I'm not sure we do. And by the way this is our life. You certainly have better things to do, don't you? - You're right. - I know. - I have my life and you have yours. - Exactly. When are going to see her? I don't know. Tell her to come back home. Try to convince her. Yes, Giulia.. I talked with dad. Where are you, can we meet? No, I want to be alone for a while and think. There's nothing to think about. There is, instead. When you feel like it come to see me. I've something to tell you, okay? As you wish. It's important, understood? Yes. See you later. Bye. Bye. Mom? What? I'm only doing that for your own sake. How do you know what's good for me when I don't? Whatever, see you. As you wish. Bye. Bye. Made in Russia. Modified by a crazy guy who ran 3 Paris-Dakar races. Before the last one he died of a heart attack. Poor guy.. Well, he ran 3 Paris-Dakars.. So, guys, Four beds, I know it's not very comfortable, not the best for leaving with family. No family, thanks. Good. It carries 900 litres of water, and you can cross the desert before it's over. Okay, we like it. How much is it then? I told you. Sorry, no discounts. It's too much. For this baby? It's a great deal. Are you sure it won't stop right out of town? You can go for 400.000 Km with no need for a mechanic.. Hello? Hello? Come on, my love.. Come on.. Sit down. Hold his hand. In a little while it'll be over.. You'll feel better. Don't leave us.. Come on, come on.. Come on.. Well, your parents are a rare case. Yes, it's not easy to meet your soulmate. - There's only a chance to meet them. - Yes, and we have to recognise them. I feel like this is my occasion. Where are you going? I don't know, we haven't decided yet. - Maybe to Africa. - Wow, Africa? Can I come with you? Please? I don't think so. Honey? Are you in? Look what I have here.. Tomorrow I'll move to Alberto's. We can't go on fooling each other. Did you understand? I don't know if you realise what you're going to do.. He's going to miss you to death. You're his father, not one in the crowd. You're his dad, dam it. Do you go out every night? You never want to stay with me? No, I don't go out every night. You always leave me alone. I need to meet Adriano, he wants to talk to me. His wife and he are breaking up and he wants to see me. - Will you have dinner out? - Yes. - Are you coming back late? - I don't know. Wait. Did you really like the baby carriage? You didn't say a word about it. It's beautiful, I told you. Are you sure everything's alright? Yes, I said. All's well. I think you're nervous, instead. I'm not nervous, just worried for Adriano, I told you. Carlo, don't hide anythng from me. Why should I hide something from you? It's my mother. - Hi. - Hi. - Say you came by car.. - I did, it's there. - Let's go. - Let's go. Don't look! The dress's sticky with rain and all shows up. I swear I won't look. - At least till it's dry? - At least till it's dry. - Where are we going then? - Straight ahead. Go. It's your fault if we haven't made love for all this time. I think the same as regards you. Ok, but there has to be a way out.. No, there isn't. We don't like each other anymore, that's all It's true, we used to be in love, but we aren't anymore. If you want we can torture each other for years wondering why our love ended, but it would be useless. It's just over. You don't realise that, but when I'm gone you'll feel better, I'll feel better and it's going to be good for the kid too. Livia, he won't be forced to grow up with 2 parents who hate one another. Wow, it's going to be good for all then! That's the way it is, Livia. Hello? Yes, just a second. It's Marco. Yes. - Nice mess! - What? I said "nice mess"! She is Mariposa, it's her party. - Happy birthday! - Thanks! She's Sara and she's Adele. He's completely gone nuts! We're transferring your call to the answering machine.. Carlo, I can't find you. Your phone and Adriano's are off. Marco called. I'm going to Paolo's as his father's dead. The others are going too and I hope to meet you there. Bye. I'm going then. - What are you going to do? - You know. But why are you so stubborn? I need to try and resist a little more Mom, this isn't a resistance test. I must prove to myself.. ..that I can make it. Maybe I can, maybe not, but.. ..I need to become more self-confident. But I'm sure I'll make it. You don't have to worry about me. Everything's going to be alright, I'll make it. Everything's fine. Your mother knows what she's doing. Bye. Hey, I could find this! Mariposa told me you're cool. - Did she? - Yes. Want some? Yes. You can drink from the bottle, I'm the only one who drank from it. Hey, this song is cool! Let's go! - Is this natural for you? - No. I've never felt like this before. I'd do everything or you. I want to stay with you forever. But what if I fall in love? What? Madam, we're closing. Good evening. Good evening. - Condolences. - Thanks. They're in the living-room. Thanks. Thanks for coming. How are you? I still don't realise what happened. You need some time. It's impossible for us to understand death. The last thing I told him was a lie. What am I going to do now? What am I going to do? He knew you loved him, Paolo. - Where is Carlo? - He went out with Adriano. Adriano's in the other room. Is he? Here she comes. Anna? Anna? Hi. - She's Virginia. - Hi. She brought a wonderful cake. Would you like some? No, thanks. I'm going to my room.. - See you! - See you. Ciao. Hey! Er, Carlo couldn't come. Why? I don't know, he had to go somewhere. But maybe he's back home at this hour, have you checked? Try. Hey, we're leaving. - What? - I'm leaving with Carlo. - Wait for the cake.. - No, I have to go. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. He's not at home, did you tell him you were coming here? Sorry? Did you tell him you were coming here at Paolo's? Listen Giulia, I don't mind other people's business, ok? What kind of business? What happened? What business are you talking about? Listen, Giulia, please.. Something happened and you don't want me to know? You have to ask him. Now you know, okay? What do you mean "ask him"? Please, Giulia. You'll get hurt, don't insist. - I'll get hurt? - Yes! What the hell are you saying? What does "you'll get hurt" mean? - Is he out with a girl? - Enough now! I don't know! I don't know. - You do. - No, I don't. What are you doing? Hey, calm down, respect our sorrow! We're transferring.. - Where is he? - He went out. Shit, Carlo I'm in a blind alley. When you get this, call me immediately! What are you doing? - Were you calling him? - No! To tell him what, Adriano? Who is this girl? Listen, I don't know! - You do! - No! - Do you know her? - No! - You do. - He met her recently too! - It's not as it seems! - Shut up! She's just a friend! I'll kill him! She's just a friend! I feel 10 years younger. And it's because of me.. Do you like to feel younger? You really want me to lose my head, don't you? No, you want me to lose it. Would you come to my place? My parents went to the country and will be back in 2 days. I want to sleep with you. I can't sorry. I have to get back home. - No.. - Yes, it's not an easy situation. You mean? I mean.. I can't spend the night outside. I can't. But I'd like to. Don't think I wouldn't, because.. ..there's nothing I want more, right now. Then what's the problem? - What.. what's the problem? - Yeah.. what is it? We're transferring.. Yes? - How are you? - Fine. We were wondering if you were sleeping. No, I wasn't. Want to come and drink something with us? No, thanks. Something else happened? No. I just need to be alone for a while. Really, please. As you wish. - Goodnight Anna. - Goodnight. She's just a friend. He'll be home soon. I have to calm down, I have to calm down. Promise me something. What? That you go home and leave her. You promise me that then come home with me. - I don't know. - Promise me. I need some time. Look when things stop working, there's nothing one can do. And that comes from you.. From me, of course. But now I have another problem. How can I fall asleep wthout you? Tell me how I can.. You'll find a way.. Bye, little baby. - Don't leave, please. - I have to, sorry, it's late. Then go. Go now or never. Goodnight, love. Goodnight. Shit! - Giulia? - Where the fuck are you? Giulia, I had an accident! You're a bastard! I had an accident! Where the fuck did you go! Giulia! Shit! I knew it, shit, I knew it! What will you tell her now? The situation is bad now. You must find an excuse, A good one too, because Giulia isn't stupid. If you say bullshits, Giulia'll understand. Why did you betray her? Why? Here I am! - What happened? - You're bastard! Why did you cheat on me like that? - Why? - Calm down! You have to, or you'll harm the baby! What have you done till now? Where have you been? You know! - What? - I was with Adriano! - With Adriano? - With Adriano, I swear! You're a bastard and a dirty liar. You make me sick! It's Adriano, you can ask him! Hello? Giulia found out everything! It's not my fault! How can I ever trust you again now? What about our dreams.. How are they going to end? Giulia, I didn't do anything wrong. - Who's this woman you went out with? - No one! I want to know who she is, Carlo! Giulia, it's never going to happen again.. Who the fuck is she? Did you 2 have sex? Tell me the truth, Carlo, did you? Tell me! There was only a kiss! - I swear it'll never happen again! - You make me sick! Who the hell is Francesca? - Who's this Francesca! - Enough! - You wanted to fuck her? - No! - Is she beautiful? - Giulia, please! - More beautiful than me? - No! No! You're a liar. What am I going to do with you now? Tell me, you dirty bastard! What am I going to do with you? - Bastard! - Giulia! Giulia, There are so many things we still can do together! - We were going to be a family. - We were! I've been pregnant for 3 months and you just say "we were"? What will you do to me in 10 years? I'm going to leave you now. You get out of this house and come back only to take your stuff and disappear forever! I hope that's clear! Giulia! Giulia, you're exagerating, dam it! - We're having a baby! - No, I'm having a baby! You must say "you are", Carlo! I'm having a baby, not you! I'd rather bring her up without a father than with a piece of shit like you! Shit! You're joking, aren't you? I'm not joking at all! What the hell! A kiss to another in three years is not so wrong, is it! It can happen! - Not to me! - Don't shout! It does you harm! You must leave. You must leave. Giulia, calm down! You make me sick! You make me sick, understand? You lost me forever! Now open that door and leave! You must leave! - Giulia! - Get lost! Giulia, where shall I go? Wherever you want. Go back to her. You must leave, get lost! Giulia.. What are you doing? I'm not scared of you! What are you doing? You must leave, I asked you one thing, just do it! Get lost! Fuck off! Fuck off! You asked for that! You asked for that! And when you understand you're wrong, it'll be late! Free at last. She asked for that. I'm free to do what I want again. Free not to lie anymore. Free to go back to her shamelessly. Free to fall in love with her even if she's 18. Free at last. Isn't that all I've ever asked for? What happened? - Can I still come in? - No, I want you to leave.. I decided to get back.. Calm down. Take some time, think about it. I was forcing myself to do something I don't really want to do. This is what you're thinking now. I don't want my freedom I can give a meaning to my life only staying with him. Without my home, or my habits, I don't know where to go. He's loved me for 30 years, in his fashion, but he did. Maybe it's not the way I wish he loved me, but I want to learn to grow old with him. The rest doesn't matter. Hi. You left without saying goodbye? You're right, sorry. I forgot my door keys. Have you seen them? Where did I put them? You look forward to leaving, don't you? You want to go back to her, don't you? Please, don't ask, okay? - What did I do to you? - Nothing. You did nothing wrong. I'm sorry. I've got your keys. You feel like joking? - Shall I wait for your call? - Yes. I'll call you. - Is Paolo in? - Yes. - Good. How are you, madam? - Bad, really bad. - I know. - It's a terrible thing. - I can imagine that. - No, nobody can. - It's terrible. - It is.. Paolo? A friend of yours is here. - Is your father still alive? - Yes, thanks. It's a terrible thing when he dies. Stay close to him if you can. Sure. Paolo! - Paolo, would you like some milk and coffee? - I don't want anything, I told you. He won't leave you alone.. I went to the car-dealer. There's another person who wants to buy it, So the dealer asked me what we want to do, What shall I do? Shall I sign a check to block the camper? Hey! Life goes on! Have you already forgotten everything? No. I'll sign you a check. Have it insured and take it away. Good. Giulia.. - Giulia! - I'm leaving. - Come back when I'm gone. - Giulia, I need to talk to you. Giulia, please, it can't end like this. And you tell me? Move this foot, please. Giulia, I made a mistake. I felt like a prisoner and I panicked. I made a mistake. Giulia! Giulia, open up! Giulia! - What's happening? - Nothing, don't worry. Giulia! Giulia open up! You have our daughter inside you! Maybe I want to lose her! Giulia, dam it, don't make me mad! Don't even think about that! I can think about anything I want. We aren't married. We're free and independent as you, bastard, have always wished us. If you try to abort I'll go out of my mind! Please do! Do you suddenly feel some pride? You know what, Carlo? I feel sorry for you. Giulia, I've never stopped loving you, I love you more than ever! - It's too late. - Giulia, please, think about it. I think about it all the time. Move this dam foot! Giulia, please.. Argh! Giulia, later in the day there's Paolo's father funeral. See you there? No! Shit, Giulia! Eternal rest grant unto him, o Lord.. And let perpetual light shine upon him.. Hail Mary.. Why do you want to leave in a haste? You could take some more time, couldn't you? - How long? - A year at least.. I can't even stand her for another week. But it's not good for you to go and live with Alberto. If you really can't stand her come and stay with us. You need some more time to think. You're not ready to live without your son. If you leave, when you're back he'll be so changed that you'll wonder if he's still your son. Too bad if he doesn't recognise you.. In a way or another I have to solve the situation. But are you leaving her for another woman? I wish! Livia is stubborn but intelligent, and charming. She has to have something good if you loved her.. Marco, I need for something new to happen every day, to feel I'm alive. If you've been with someone for a long time, at a certain point you think you've reached a blind alley, but you haven't. Actually it's just a different alley. If you understand that, you'll feel unique because you've loved the same person for so long without willing to run away. If I didn't have her, I wouldn't have a place to go. It would be bad. Normality is the true revolution. You did what any of us would do. You met a girl and went out with her. You wanted to have sex with her and you did. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Fidelity is a utopia. And now? "And now" what? How do I deal with all this? - The hell with it! - Giulia! My child! What happened? He'll hate me only if you help him to think of me as of a bad and superficial father. It's what you are. No, that's what I am now, Livia. In six months or a year, I'll be back, and if you want I'll have Matteo live with me, so you can leave like I did. No problem. Or maybe in 6 months after we meet again we go back together. Who knows.. Everything can happen. You know, I can't even hate you. That's why we're breaking up, Livia. We can no longer give each other strong emotions. Go to hell. Please love, call me.. Come on, call me.. 1, 2, 3, now, call me.. - Francesca? - Mom can you get out please? Get out! - Hello? - Hello, it's me. Is it too late? Dam it! Hello? Carlo? We're transferring your.. - Hello? - This is Paolo. - What's the time? - Did I awake you? Well, I must get up early tomorrow. I wanted to tell you I'm leaving. I heard of your father's death. I'm sorry. This time I'm really leaving. I heard that too. It'll be good for you. Yes. Listen.. When you're back call me to tell me how it went. It can be a while.. Whenever. Call me if you like. Why, are there problems with the other guy? More or less.. Hey if you want we can meet right now! You can tell me how things are going, if you like, as in fact I'm at your door. Paolo, don't start again. Ok, I won't. I said when you come back. Ok, when I come back. Have a nice journey. - I will. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Hello? - This is Francesca. - Who's that? - Mom it's for me. Hang up. - Is he still there? - He's about to leave. Hang up! - What happened? - His phone's always off. Maybe the battery needs recharging.. Don't say bullshit to make me happy. I feel it's over. The more you feel it, the more you call for bad luck. I told you earlier but you don't listen to me. Everything's going to be alright. Go to sleep, and it's going to be alright. You'll see him tomorrow, relax. Could you call me back? What? - I want to check my phone line and.. - Sorry, I can't right now, Fra'.. Goodnight. Hello? Aren't you excited by the idea of interrupting everything? Everything we did so far.. It's a powerful emotion, isn't it? Hello? - Francesca, breakfast's ready. - Get out. - What happened? - Nothing, all's well. Get out! Go to hell.. - I'm asking for temporary retirement. - Giulia disappeared! If he gets mad I'll bring him a health certificate. I need some rest. Full stop! Her phone's been off since yesterday! Maybe she's at her mother's place.. But what do you care? You've always hoped for her to leave you. Now that she did, what do you want? - Hello? - This is Carlo. I'm looking for Giulia, is she there? - Yes. - Don't put her through, if she tries to leave stop her. I'll be right there. Carlo! Carlo! Carlo! Hi.. I know you're busy at this hour, but I couldn't resist. Hi, love. Yesterday I bought something for you. I want you to have it. Don't you take it? Aren't you curious to know what it is? It's my favourite. Yesterday I read a bit of it again and thought of you. I thought of you all day, yesterday. Don't you think you ran too fast? I ran to you.. I'm not that wonderful person you believe I am. Why not? Because another girl I still love is giving me a baby. That's the truth. You said you had problems and you wanted to leave her.. I need to stay with her, instead. I'm sorry. That's all. What do you mean "that's all"? You didn't tell me she's pregnant. All I want is to be happy with her. This is hurting me very much. I thought there could be something beautiful between us. For a moment I believed that too. Then what's the problem, love? - Try to understand.. - What? My place is somewhere else right now. It's nobody's fault, not yours, not mine. That's just how it is. If you want I will accept for you to stay with her as well. And maybe in time things'll be alright.. Nothing's going to be alright if we keep seeing each other. Trust me on this. That's how it is. Bye, little baby. Forgive me, if you can. Don't go away, please, my love. Don't say that. You'll make things harder. Please.. Carlo! Carlo's just called. You didn't tell him I'm here, did you.. This is not the right time for escaping. You told him! Don't get mad.. I asked you not to tell him.. Mom, I only asked you for one thing.. - You're having a baby.. - Yes, I'm having a baby, I am! Giulia, these things happen.. He made a mistake, tomorrow you could make one too.. Mom, please! - I betrayed your father as well.. - These are your problems! - But we're still here. - Enough! My child, life is also made of compromise.. I won't end up like you. Why? How did I end up? Have you looked at you? Don't be inconsiderate. Hello! It's me! What do you want? Only talk! You must leave! Go away! Are you happy now? What are we going to do? Let him in. Wait, let me speak to her again. - Okay? - Okay. Honey? Honey, can I come in? Carlo isn't here, he's with dad. We don't have to get used to their love. We don't have to get used to their devotion, to monotony, to the fact that their bodies are deformed by age.. Can I come in? We don't have to think that marriage is a boring and monotonous thing. You still love him. I hate him! We don't have to stop listening to them, even when they tell us the same thing again and again. We don't have to stop being attracted to them, or being kind and caring. You couldn't renounce him anyhow. If I want, I can.. If people have married for thousand years, there has to be a reason. You have to stay with him. Think of what made you happy when you two were together, and get ready to take care of your child with him. This is all that matters. Do you think you can stay with her forever? I know you believe that. Nothing's going to be the same. You don't know. Don't.. Come on.. Everything's going to be fine. What name will you give to the baby? We still don't know. When your daughter comes to you and says she's pregnant, one day, if you're still together you'll feel like we did, suddenly old. Then you'll wonder if the years you spent together were worth while. Are they? I think so. But it's useless to speak about this, words are like the wind. If you're still together at that point it means you did all you could to be. It won't be easy, this means you'll really wanted it. This is my wish for the two of you. Never stop believing. She's waiting for you. Take care of her. ..crying ..and calling you ..if you weren't here, ..close to me, ..with me. It's never going to happen again. Never again. Are you sure you just gave her a kiss? Yes. If I was a little stronger our relationship would be over. I hate you. Do you understand? Think of our daughter. Why did you do such a bad thing to me? Why? Because I was afraid of not being ready for such a big thing. Enough! I don't want to hear you! Stop talking then, and let's go back together. It'll be worth while. No! We have a lot of things to do together. I love you! I love you, I love you, I love you.. We were born to stay together, it's what we used to say. - We were wrong! - We weren't! - Then I was. - Give me another chance! Only one! I'll grow up.. I'll grow up, my love. How? How will you grow up? If you still want it we can get married. Just give me the time for the documents. I mean it, it's not so to speak. Think of our daughter. We can start again, if we want. We'll get married and be happy. You'll see. You'll see, my love. Why can't I hate you? We were born to stay together. You'll see, my love. Here I am. I decided to put an end to teen-age and grow up. And I will. Everything is going to change now, this time it will. I'll get a larger house, with a pool, a garage and a nice garden. A porch with flowers and polished doors. "Marx" the dog and "Giulia" the boat. I'll have health and life insurance.. The fridge always full not to think I'm poor. An ethnic carpet to keep feeling young, and sunny windows. I'll have my happy family, my healthy kids, and her. I'll have her, to remind me of all the wonderful things i got. Isn't that what I was dreaming of? To our lives! To what we were and what we'll become! That's how it went. Some people leave and some others stay. I chose to stay. I know I'll be a father in a few months. I try to get used to the idea, also because I still haven't realised what it really means. Sometimes I think of my 3 friends, Where they are, what they're doing, I like to think I can reach them some day and stay with them for a while. It's a nice thought. That's Sveva's hand. She's the most beautiful child I've ever seen. Some say she looks like Giulia, maybe that's why I love her so much. She turned 2 two days ago, She's learning to speak, She says "television", "sky", "sun", "belly", "mom" and "dad". Giulia is more and more beautiful. She likes to work out, She goes swimming three times a week and goes jogging every day. Maybe it's too much? The thing Sveva loves the most is dance Strauss with me. She looks me in the eye, then smiles and falls asleep. I could look at her for hours. I listen to her breathe and try to see myself from the outside, and I don't think my life's bad at all. I don't really need anything. Really. Is this happiness? I think it is. # By lyliakar #
