I'm sorry, Cathy, I can't help it. It's really starting to bother me. Today, I'll talk to Marshall. Deejay: Good morning, Denver. 7:00 A.M., and traffic is flowing smoothly. Gonna be just a gorgeous day. Temperatures in the mid 70s all week. That's the forecast, so get out there... Beer sales up across the board. Southeastern United States up 23.4%. Western up 16.6. Overall increase in one-week period ending Friday, 21.2%. Marshall toy division, quarterly sales off nine percent. That Tommy transvestite doll is a dud. We're selling onlyhalf as many dolls. I like that foreign job. Who makes it? Prezoni motors. Buy it. The car?The company. We own the company. How's it doing?Poorly. Sell it. What do you mean,she lost the xerox machine? How can you losea whole xerox machine? Gentlemen, the old think tank perking today? Yes. Certainly, Mr. Marshall. This week, we're workin' on polyester poker chips. Polyester potato chips! Super. Eat one, Jenkins. Sir, excuse me. I wonder if I mighthave a word with youin my office. Sure. Anything for my new head of research. I've got a minute. Mr. Marshall, I appreciate the promotion. I really do. The big office, money, the prestige. It's really great. You deserve it. We've only been using your ingredient for two weeks, and beer sales have skyrocketed. That's what worries me, sir. You see, this thing could conceivably get out of hand. I just stumbled on it. I had no idea... You're right. It's a hell ofa nice office.Sir? How aboutthat secretary, hmm? Have you everheard her belch? What?belch. Honest to god, she belches withthe best of 'em. Sir... About her, sir. I don't think she's literate. She has all sorts of talents, Blake. Learn to enjoy life. You've earned it. Look, I found it. I found the xerox machine. Good for you, honey. Hell of a nice office. Need some paint. See to that, Jenkins. Stay on top ofthose potato chips, guys. Sir... Hancock. Han... Man: Famine relief efforts continue, but it may be a case of too little, too late. From Somalia, this is Roger wentworth reporting. Woman: Here's news from wall street. The dow Jones average was down more than two points as investors engaged in heavy profit-taking. Speaking of profits, here's a hot tip from ksqr. Man: Marshall beer of Denver-- always one of the nation's smaller breweries-- has vaulted into national prominence. Figures disclosed today show that Marshall, led by an aggressive advertising...Advertising? Is that right, Blakely? We'll just seeabout that. Sir, I've got something very important to tell you. Save it forthe board meeting,jenkins. We're late already. Sir, I really think...Save it! Gentlemen, ladies. I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay, Mr. Marshall. You're damn rightit is. As I'm sure you'rewell aware, the quarterlyreports are in. A brief rundownshows a numberof things. First off, thingsare looking up in ladies underwear,eh, Wilson? Home appliances areup three percent. We're lookingpretty good, with one notableexception. Man: Here it comes. What's going onin toys, tinker? Sir, I...Save it! Right now, we're goingto talk about beer. You've heard rumors. Well, you'veheard right. A 20% sales increasein two weeks. Two weeks! And you know what? That's nothing. Not even the tip ofthe proverbial iceberg. I'm going totell you why. I'm sure you've allhad a chance to meet our new head of researchblake teegarden. Some weeks ago, teegarden came to me with a small vial of liquid. I couldn't believe what he told me. Added to our beer, this stuff makes it irresistible. Practically addictive. No matter how many Marshall beers you drink, you want more. What's even better, it's undetectable, untraceable, and can't be duplicated by anyone, including us. If we only have a small vial of it, how long will it last? There's enough in that little jar to flavor the Atlantic ocean, and we've got every drop of it. No, sir,we don't. What? What was that? I said...I know what you said. I was told it couldn't be duplicated. Maybe not duplicated, sir, but it can be stolen. Half the formula is missing.Half?! How the hell can you lose half of it?! We've been storing it in two separate vials. One is added to the beer, the other was in chemical research. That's the one we're missing. Find it, Jenkins. Only six people have access to the blue room where the stuff is kept. Four are in this room. They check out. That leaves Meredith Casey in chemical research, and teegarden. You think teegarden stole it? No, sir, I don't. However, miss Casey is another story. The thing is... What?! She used to work for lakeside breweries. Most of you are aware, lakeside brews four beers, but only one nationally. Come on, Joe, make your point. She called in sick Friday. No one has seen her or been able to reach her for three days. We've run a spot survey on western beer sales over the last 48-hour period. El macho sales show a net 14% increase. Lakeside. That bitch! As you can see, our sudden andrather dramaticincrease in sales is due solelyto this ingredient, and, of course,to the foresightof Ms. Richards. Oh, thank you, dear. My late husband-- rest his soul-- was a pioneer in this business. Hell, everyone knows that only faggots drink Marshall. Yes, ma'am. Would you care for some tea, sir? Dear, would you pour for us? As I was saying, it will bea massive media battle to reach the market first. However, if marshallhappens to losethe ingredient, the problem becomespurely academic. And you want me to obtain the rest of the formula? Sounds interesting. "Interesting"? For $5 million, let's hope it'smore than interesting. Touche. Chateau margaux, 1955, I believe. Excellent. Well, you certainly doknow your tea. A hobby. Let's not forgetwe're talkingbeer here, sir. Understood? Indicum. Hybrid, lapana. Gerber Daisy. 48 petals. This one has 49. I still don'tknow your name. Really? I have to make the check out to someone. No problem, Mrs. Richards. I have a stamp. Doll face, time for a swim. The heater's not working. I said in the pool now! Move!jerk! Well? It's been confirmed. Lakeside evidently discovered the bug, but not before we found out what we needed to know. You sexist pig! Say, cupcake, see how long you can hold your breath underwater, okay? That's better. Go on. They hireda private agent-- supposedly the best. Maybe we should do the same. Yes, sir, I've gotsomebody in mind. A local freelancer--low profile. Plays your basichardball. Sounds like my kind of guy. Jesus Christ, with lungs like that, you should be able to live down there. Try again. What's this guy's name, anyway? Mullins, sir. Fred mullins. Better known as crummy Fred. Boy: Check out the nerds! Bring me a beer, there, sexy. Girl: Look at those geeks! Boy: What's the matter, gimps? No place to play? Boy: Some nut'sgot a bb gun. Take cover! Some guyhas a bb gun. Ohh! Gosh, how crummy! What have you done?! Not again! All these houses look the same. Are you gonna pay forthis, Fred? Are you gonna fix it? You just wait untilgeorge gets home. Your car's in my garage. Fred! Listen, damn it! I am not gonna tell you again. We were pursuing a known criminal, and I am sorry that your mother got shot. Christ, you woulda thought I killed the bitch. Where the hell have you been? Target practice. Any messages? Yeah. D.A.'S officecalled. Told 'emyou were out of town. Guy next door came by.Told him you wereout of town. Finance company called.Told 'em you were dead. Marshall...marshall industries called. Marshall industries? Yeah. Marshallindustries. Some guy named Jenkins. Why? What'd youdo to him? Miss Shepard,take a letter, please. Where?what? These 4-r forms have to go to bascom's office. Who?bascom in accounting. I never heard of him. Sign this. Okay, what am I signing? What am I signing? Hey, what did I sign? What is this? It says "electric forks." They are electric forks. They're prototypes. Are colors capitalized? Colors--red, green, blue, yellow. No!good. "Dear Mr. Green..." Sir!what? The bascom forms. What are those? 4-r, sir, 4-r. Solar pencil. I'm notgonna sign this. Polyesterpoker chips, electric forks,solar pencils. Whatever it is, hancock,you take care of it, okay? It's all the way over! Straighten out. Straighten out, you mother! Oh-ho! You shoulda stuckto basketball, bill. Nah. All Shepards play golf. It's in our blood. Newsweeksays so. Fire away. It's your golf bag! What you waitin' for? Those guys onthe fairway. Would you be real? You couldn't hit 'em with a Cannon! That is, unless, of course, you've invented a supersonic golf ball. No, hardly. I work onmore important things like polyesterpoker chips. And certain beverages, old buddy. Hey, you don'tknow about that, remember? All right, all right. Blake! Blake, isn't that Spence markham from first national? Man, would I love his account. Look at you. Look at me,for cryin' out loud. Don't you rememberour college days, huh? You and me and Meredith-- we were gonna changethe whole word. What happened, buddy? Man, just think about all the reallybeneficial things this ingredientcould work in. Do you know thatthere are enough protein-rich substancesin the ocean alone to feedthe entire planet? Blake, you sound like a goddamn pbs documentary. All we gotta dois learn how tomake it taste decent. Like seaweed and all that shit. Plankton.right. My wife's cooking.Exactly. It gets worse. Meredith has disappeared, and she took some of the stuff with her to a competitor. Meredith?i don't believe it. Why would shedo that? I don't know. Jealousy, envy. Sour grapes. You knowwhat they say-- "a woman scorned..." Does Cathy know? Not yet. That conniving little snot! I told you she was no good. I told you not to bring her here. Come on. She was one ofthose communists that spray paintedthe homecoming float before the stanfordgame, remember? The whole sororitystayed up all night pasting on thoseteeny-weeny azaleas. What are youlaughing at? I wasn't laughing. That was a long time ago. Why do youalways defend her? Meredith and I share a mutual respect. I can't believewhat I am hearing. Open your eyes, baby. She crossed you. She stole yourprecious ingredient. Because I let her down. I've let everybody down. Cathy, don't you see what's happening here? Promotion, raise, status. Marshall thinks he can buy me now. "Here lies Blake teegarden-- human marshmallow." It's hardlythat bad, Blake. You've gota great job, great kids. A super-sexy wife. Worry about it tomorrow,marshmallow balls. "Marshmallow balls." "Marshmallow balls"? Well... We'll just see about that, tangerine tits. Mary, Billy, eat your breakfast. We don't want to be late for school. Mommy, I don't like butter on my toast. Eat the other side. Morning, sweetie. Will you hand me the orange juice? Sure. Cathy?uh-huh. There's beerin the refrigerator. Marshall beer. Haven't you heard? Prohibition's been repealed. I thought I made it rather clearthe other night that there wasto be no beer. When friends drop by, it's only polite to offer something besides kool-aid. And, speaking of friends, I invited bill and Laura over for dinner a week from Thursday. Don't forget. Yes, and since whendoes beer come infive packs? So I was thirsty. Excuse me. So, what's going on today? Oh, I don't know. Every day's an adventure in that zoo. You work in a zoo, daddy? Yes, Billy, daddy works in the zoo. No, he doesn't. Daddy makesmarshall beer. Everybody drinksmarshall beer. That's right, honey. Not me. I drink El macho. What? I will when I'm old enough. Tommy's dad says it puts hair on your chest. I don't wanthair on my chest. Everybody drinksmarshall beer. Right, daddy? That's right, honey. Everybody drinks Marshall beer. No, no, no. Honey, no. Your mama is lying. They drink it. Deejay: Hey, Denver, looking for a job with great pay and super benefits? Well, here's your chance.

I'll bet hereally enjoyshis work, huh? Yes. I mean, no. I don't think he likes his job at all. He's always complaining. Oh. About what? Lots of things. But especially about beer. Oh. You know, I don't think he likes Mr. Marshall. But didn't Mr. Marshallgive him this nice job? Yes. Yes. Ooh, yes! Thank you. Thisis all you got? We're working on it.

They seemperfectly happy. You really think so? It's not as hopeless as it seems. Together, we can stop this, Mr. Teegarden. Don't be alarmed. Listen, perhaps we canspeak about thisin private. Uh...well,there, perhaps. All right, what is this all about? Who are you, and how do you know my name? What'll it be, guys? We got Marshall, Marshall lite, Marshall stout, Marshall dark, and Marshall ale. Coffee? Coffee?! Hey, everybody, the wimp wants coffee! How about you, Rambo? Milk and cookies? Coffee'll be fine. Two coffees! We're very concerned about this situation, as, of course, you are. "We"?who's we? Pardon me. My name is Robert Johnson. I represent the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints. You're a mormon? Are you surprised? Two coffees. What do you wantwith me? The church has become increasingly concerned with the moral deterioration caused by this situation. I repeat--what do youwant with me? You can get me into the blue room. You know aboutthe blue room. Of course. It's one thingto know aboutthe ingredient. It's quite anotherthing to destroy it. Listen, please believe me. Once we're in there, we can get the job done, and you can get us in there. Or at least, your badge can. How am I gonnado that? The badge is sensitizedto begin with.

I'll take two people with me-- my associate misty Roberts, and Mr. Teegarden. I'll need someone who can identify this stuff. Is this some sortof a joke? I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm not asking you to do this for free, Blake. It will be well worth your while. No, no, you're... This is... You're serious. You object, Mr. Teegarden? No, but I'm not going. I can go.

Whole cities don'tjust disappear. You're right. It was just a big cloud. Where's the landing strip? I don't seeany lights. No problem. Old Billy boy won't light up the strip until he hears us. Should be comin' up any time now. Over there. All right! Roger dodger and all that good stuff! All right, everybody, hold on. We're goin' in. It's gonna be a little rocky. Man: Silencio. Mullins: Let's go. What the...? Man: Federales! Andale! Marijuana! You idiot! This is Mexico! Damn! All these landing strips look alike! Come on, move it! Adios, amigos. I'm outta here. I surrender, I surrender, I surrender. Mullins: This bastard'sleaving without us. Get back here,you moron! There's a Jeep. Let's take this one. Hancock: Wait for me. Wait for me! Don't shoot, kemo sabe. Amigo, amigo. Misty: Shut up,you geek! Woman: Hi. Welcome to lakeside, the oldest brewery in the western United States. My name is Roxanne. I'm going to be your tour guide this morning. Please, everybody, walk this way. The sounds you're hearingare the brewery pumps pumping 24 hours a day. And as you may know, lakeside'sel macho beer is the second-largestselling beer in the world,soon to benumber one. Now we're allgoing to enterthe aging room, so please,everybodystay together and watch your step. Follow me. Ah! Damn thing always works on TV. Hey! Oh, hi there. Hi. I'm, uh... I seem to be lost. Freeze, you scumball. Come on, stop. Stop! Hey, hey, please stop! Hey, come on. Running faster. Hey, fancy meeting you here. Someone's out there shooting me with a gun-- a real gun. Guard: Cover the west wing.I'll do the third floor. Wilma, check outthe ladies bathroom. May I help you? Oh, miss Casey. This stall is occupied. I know. I just, uh, uh... Is everything okay? Good. That's good. Bye. Bye! Now, what is thisall about? I think you know. It's time we put an end to this. How do you proposeto do that? Get back the ingredient, all of it. Take back what's mine. Ours. What makes you so sureI'll help you? Why did you call me at home last Thursday-- to chat? You didn't really believe you could justwaltz in here and steal the vial,did you? That's patently absurd. I thought together maybe... You, me, and the u.S.Marines, maybe. Now that you'vebroadcast your presenceover this plant, you'll be luckyjust to get out of here. Beat it, sister.We're busy. We have got to try, Meredith. We've got to. The security systemhere is flawless--perfect. I designed it. We haven't lost that humble touch, have we? The point is,you don't evenhave a gun. All right, what if I were to tell you that someone else is planning to destroy your vial tonight-- somebody with guns, lots of guns-- but no brains. Could we help them? Possibly. Possibly. Do you rememberyour physical sciences? Ac-DC, positive,negative, all that stuff? Are you kidding? Just last week, I wired Billy's electric train. Good enough. You think this'll do it, huh? Yes. So who wasshooting at you,anyway? I don't know. Some fat guy. Harold. Oh, cripes,i hope he didn'thurt himself. This isn't gonna hurt anybody, now, is it ? Of course not.It's only gonnacut the power. Make sure youset it for 11 hours. I know, Meredith, I know. I know you havea right to beangry with me. You could've talked to me, Meredith. You saw whatwas happening, or maybe you didn't. What's that supposed to mean? How much did marshallpay you to keepyour mouth shut-- 30 pieces of silver? Oh, first-rate analogy, miss Judas. Wilma: Harold! Harold, I'm right here. Hurry, Harold. Oh, Harold! Let's go downstairs. Oh, Harold. The belt.Let's get the belt. The belt! The zipper! Oh, Harold! Oh, Harold! Good god, they're not going to do it here?! If what I didwas so wrong, then why didn't youjust go public? Why sneakback here? 'Cause maybe I deserved something, too. You got chief of research. I got nothing. Nada.zero. Zilch. No credit, no respect, no... Money?yes. I mean, no. I mean, it goes a lot deeper than that. Is that so hard to understand? Oh, Christ, I think I'm gonna be sick. What made youchange your mind? Same reason you changed yours. Some things are still important, aren't they? Station 12. Checking out a problem in the power plant. Yeah, I'll be right up. Come on. Oh, Harold! Sh! This is so frustrating, Harold. That was traumatic.Let's get outta here. When I called youthat morning, how did you knowit was me? Well, I didn't at first. Then I remembered that nobody but you calls me Blakely. I hate that. One last question...Blakely. Why, why, why did you marry that bubblehead? I mean, really, a cheerleader! I happen to enjoythe company ofsocially gregarious people, and she's nota bubblehead, and why did ittake you so longto ask me that flat out? You must hate me. And if you don't, then maybe you should. I think it would be good for you. You are a chemist,not a shrink. Meredith, it is not good to hold these feelings in. I am very serious. Do something. Let it go. Yell at me, scream, hit me. I am not goingto hit you. Fine. Suit yourself. Besides, I don't believe in violence. Is this Marshall? Who the hell do you think it is? Shut up! Who is this? This is the workers'freedom army, baby. And let me assure you,beer breath, we got no love for you or your filthycapitalist pig sty, nor have we anyfor lakeside, honky! It is the destiny of the corruptand decadentcapitalist to greedilydrown one another in the slime ofperverted materialism. And we intend to help you do this. What?! There's a dudenamed teegarden. Lakeside has him. You want him. They demand a vial, you offer money. Now we can get himany time we desire, but we got no needfor any vial. But you could use the money. Bingo, beer breath. Now you slap$1 million in locker number threein concourse bof the Denver international airport. How do I know you can get him? We can get him. We can also kill him. No tricks, no surveillance. The money! Tonight! You think ioverdid it? Could that have been lakeside? No, not a chance. They didn't grabteegarden fora lousy million. What do we do? You heard the man. What choicedo I have? Hell, a million dollarsis nothing. Not a thing. Oh, hell, putthe money in the locker. Security stakeout? No, no, we can'trisk it. I need teegarden. Hancock, get your butt over here! The border's onlya couple of blocksfrom here. If we're careful... Look, I say rush 'em. Then, I can personally blow those beaners halfway to hell. No, there'stoo many of 'em. We gotta be inside lakeside by midnight tonight. Hey, maybe we can just walk through like everybody else. Right. And we'll just declare these with your plaster pigs. If we had a car... Where are we going to get a car? We can disguise the Jeep. As what? A Jeep is a Jeep. Disguise the Jeep. What?!I'll check out the border crossing. Maybe we can sneak across. Just be careful. I mean, who knows? They might be looking for us. No sweat. Hancock gave me an idea. Sombreros? Sombreros? Sombreros, senor? Ten dollars. Ten dollars. Banderas. Banderas grandes. Mexican flags. Banderas, banderas. Hey, fella, hey there. I'll takeone of those. No, no. Hey, hello there. Buenos dias, senor. How much... Cuantos dollars los piggo? 50 bucks. Fifty? You mean50 pesos. No, 50 bucks, gringo. Fifty? But the guy over hereonly wants 3.50. Then buy one from him, you cheap son of a bitch. I get it.You wanna bargain. Okay, one dollar. Gee, that was easier than I thought. Mullins: We'll head east, then find a soft spotto cross the border. This is a hell of a way of spending a Saturday afternoon. You gota better idea? That'sthe border patrol. I saywait till dark. Yeah, and I say let's get 'em now. I'll blast 'em. Let's wait two minutes. We'll make sure. Do you know what's gonna happen if we sit around and wait? Haven't you tried to kill enough people for one day? Will you listen to this little fart? Shut up,both of you. We're all inthis together, or ain't youfigured thatout yet? By George, you're absolutely right. I apologize, miss Roberts. And by George, you can shove it up... Roberts.what? Apologize. No.roberts! All right, you're right. It's been a long day. I'm sorry. Lifesaver? Gee, thanks.Wait. Christ almighty!That's a suicidelifesaver. Oh, my mistake. I'm so sorry. I would never do anything... All right.Blow it. Thank you very much. Let's go. Jesus. Wait. Where areyou going? I'm sorry, my dear, but I must be on my way. I have a pressing appointment at midnight. So soon? Do you have to go? I mean, it wasthe best ever. You were...You were... Perfect? Yes. Yes! Wait. You nevertold me your name. Didn't I? Hurry up. This is lakeside. We'll go over here. I'll go first. Hancock, just watch me, and do exactly as I do. I don't thinki can do itthat fast. Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the mile high city of Denver, Colorado. We hope you've enjoyed your flight from San Diego, and look forward to serving you again in the near future. Local time is 9:32 P.M. Blake! Psst! You okay? Of course,I'm okay.Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Welcome home. Right. Hey, thanks, bill. Hey, thinknothing of it. Listen, cathyand the kidsare just fine. We'll meet you therein an hour. All right. Seems like old times, huh? Off the pigs! Off the pigs! I don't like it. Lakeside must beon full alert and all, kidnapping teegarden. It's too quiet. All I know is if we get past that guard house, we're in the brewery, right? Is that the building? Yeah.all right. Will you look at that? No wonder they're number two. Great. Let's get inside. Hey, what are you doin'? Just get in there. I'll finish him off. What?! That does it. Listen, mullins, this isn't world war III, for cryin' out loud. What if he wakes up,you damn fool? If we leave now, he'll never know we were here. You gutless vegetable!Why take the chance?! Man: Please state your name and business. My name is Cary Grant, and I have an appointmentwith Mr. Marshall. The Cary Grant? Sure. Go right on in. You're my all-time favorite movie star, Mr. Grant. Wait'll I tell my wife. She was crazy about Philadelphia story. Man: Attention, floor five. Indicate central confirmation procedure for elevator security clearance. Joe, this is Harry. Goddamn elevator's stuck. It's openin' and closin' and openin' and closin'. Yeah? No kiddin'?No kiddin'. Call maintenance, will ya? Now? Now, for Christ's sake. Geez, Harry, it's almost midnight. Oh, that's tough. Harry, guess who's with Jack Marshall right now. I'll give ya a hint. Listen. Judy, Judy, Judy. Harry, did ya hear me? Judy, Judy, Judy. Give up? Huh? This is it. I knew it. The brewery manager's office. The laboratory must be close by. From here on,no talking,no noise. Hand signals only. Killer. Killer! Hold it. Misty, light up. I think this is it. Aha! Electronic beam. I think we can all get under. I'll go first, then misty. Hancock, watch our rear. Oh, my god! Hey, I think someone's comin'. Hurry up. Tanks. Tanks! Tanks! Power failure. What a break. Come on. That must be it. Hancock, check it out.Right. Damn! No time! That's why I came,to identify... Goddamn it, put a sock in it! Blow it! You got 15 seconds from the time I release this. What do I dowith these? Throw 'em in. They'll make a nice noise. Hancock, you got the mapwhere's the exit? Straight ahead. It's to the right. If there's one thing I can do, it's read a map. "The one thing I can do is read a map." I think I brokeevery bone in my body except the little fingeron my left hand. Ah! Mr. Teegarden. Bit warm fora spot of tea. Not tea, Mr. Johnson. Coffee. Ah, yes. Coffee. Mr. Johnson.Mormons. Coffee. Mormons don'tdrink coffee. I seem to havemade a mistake. Is Johnson your real name? Ah, miss Casey. We meet again. Freeze. You'll pardon meif I seemsomewhat confused. May I havesome coffee? Sure. Thank you.You bet. You know, it now becomes painfully clear that I could've broken into that room at any time, yet you chose this day and this hour that you may join me. My time wasdemanded elsewhere. Tonight, your counterparts in California destroyed lakeside's vial. However, since their expertise is no match for yours... We felt obligatedto help them a bit. I'm flattered. And now, I wouldlike to make youa business proposition. You want to buy back... No, no, no,that's not the point. The money is justfor start-up costs. The ingredientis the key. If you could have anything in the world, what would it be? Anything? Everyone has a secret dream, a hidden fantasy-- something so farfetched as to be virtually unthinkable. Together, we could do great things, wonderful things. Interesting. I suggest wecarry on this conversation elsewhere. The fireworksare to beginin two minutes. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, by the way, Mr. Teegarden, why don't you get rid of that ridiculous cap pistol? Correct me ifI'm wrong,mr. Teegarden, but it is my impressionthat this ingredient can be usedonly in beer. No, beer was an accident. It was the first thing I stumbled on. I know it can work in other things. Beer was easy money. They don't care. And you do? Yes. I know this will work. You know, the young ladyis very persuasive. Well, for starters, how about seaweed souffles? Yeah, how about it? I could haveyou all arrested. You won't. Why not? You've got too much to lose. It seems i'vealready lost it. You've lost a few buildings-- insured beyond their value, no doubt. No doubt. I've also lostthe ingredient. What's to keep mefrom taking it back? It's too late. Lakeside'll scream bloody murder. They have no reason not to, unless, of course, neither side has the ingredient. Look, we keep quiet, and we keep the ingredient, okay? Sad to say, you'll both still sell a lot of beer, even without it. It'll be our little secret. Teegarden, you area son of a bitch. You're hardly in a position to insult him. Why, Meredith,i meant it Asa compliment. Blake! Blake! We're over here. Oh, that's our ride. Mr. Marshall, have a pleasant evening. It's been fun. Man: Building four is to be evacuated immediately. Repeat: Evacuate building four. This is a precautionary measure only. Hey, hey, hey,good to see you! How's it goin'?Great. Just great. Bill, you haven'tchanged a bitsince college. Meredith, you look great, too. Maybe we oughta get outta here. Uh, miss Casey,may I offer you a ride? Since it appearswe'll be working together, perhaps we can makeone another's acquaintance. That would be nice, Mr. Johnson. Please, you cancall me barkley. Then tell me, barkley, your instructions were to steal the vial, not blow up the building. Isn't this a bit ostentatious? This, my dear,was a special favor to a rather determinedyoung lady. Oh? And who might that be? Don't you just love happy endings? I do. Such a fitting climax to an esoteric fable of moral turpitude and conflicting social values. Yet, of course, viewers of limited intellectual capacity may find our message somewhat oblique. It is to those I say sour grapes. See ya.
