Coming to the stage, "A Tribute to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." Come on and take the stage! Take the stage! Good afternoon. My name is Gregory Payton. My name is Victoria Bowie. - Tucker Eddy. - Madeline Guevara. Thank you for this opportunity to be here... And today, I will be performing a speech that I wrote on my own. And today, I will be performing for you... "Still I Rise," by Maya Angelou. An original poem called "Dr. MLK." The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. See, my black is beautiful, from the top of my head, to the tips of my toes. "The time is always right to do the right thing." One inspirational quote, but what does it really mean? Does my black life matter to the world as it matters to my mother and my father? There's been a long list of African-American women who deserve to be recognized. We fight today, we fight tomorrow. But guess what? That doesn't stop our sorrow. Criminals! Animals! That is what some people think about immigrants and refugees, but that is not who we are! Immigrants are not criminals! My generation will become a generation that remembers that although we have different skin colors, we still have the same color of blood running through our veins. It's time to stop discrimination! It's time to stop violence! It's time to stand up against hate! 'Cause I'm a woman, phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, that's me. Thank you. Okay, you're on, begin. Hi, my name is Gregory Payton. - My principal is Ms. Zarina Ahmad... - Okay, let's stop. I want... You're not speaking in your speaker voice, your orator voice. I want you to use your speaker voice. Let's start again. Take a deep breath. Good. - Good morning. - Good morning. - There you go. - My name is Gregory Payton. I am in the third grade. I will be giving a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The Lord is my shepherd. - I shall not want. - Yes. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. I will be performing the last speech that Dr. King gave, "I've Been To The Mountaintop," and I kind of like did a little addendum where I would just be doing the 23rd number of the Psalms, and some of the words that Dr. King said in his speech. I've been practicing after school, before school, any time I get a chance. Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead, but it really doesn't matter with me now. I just want to do Go... - Because I've been to the mountaintop. - Okay, we're gonna stop. You're okay. You're okay, you're fine. I want you to relax, and I want you to give it that Gregory Payton power. The Lord is my shepherd! I shall not want. He leads me! Okay, let's go. Let's start again. As I was at school when I was practicing it, my tutor, she said "When you're in front of an audience saying this speech, "you're gonna be like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the way he said it." You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. When you say, anoints my head with oil, I want both hands going to the head. - Do that with me. - You anoint my head... - With oil. My cup! - ...with oil. And I like the way you gave the inflection when you said, "My cup!" I want you to make your hands give that same inflection. Let's do it together. Anoint my head with oil. My cup! All right, let me have a bump. - How do you feel? Good. - Good. And you're gonna have those nervous butterflies, but that's okay. When you feel that little tickling that you get, you just keep speaking. We are the fruits of Fruitvale! Beautiful without fail! Our roots run deep like the Oaklandish tree! The Martin Luther King Oratorical Fest is like a deep tradition that the entire city and the community looks forward to. "Freedom and equality, that's all you need." "These leaders did not give up." Don't sit around and let all this happen. Let's stand up together. The festival is pre-K through 12. We have somewhere between 800 to 1,200 students who participate. You'll have poetry, original and published. You'll have speeches, famous and not so famous. You'll have monologues. "Because the color my skin come from way deep down within." Every year, we participate in the Martin Luther King Oratorical Fest. I think it's really important for the kids to learn more about him, what he did, the power of his words, but also just like the power of their words, to see how they can make a difference also. "For all people, for all races, "for all our different shapes and faces, "for rich or poor, for high or low, let's have freedom wherever we go." You get to use your voice and say what you think, and it can inspire people, and you get to shout out what you feel inside. We all to get compete and have fun. If you win, you win. If you lose, you lose. But you're still happy 'cause at least you tried. Stand up! Let's make a difference! Barack Obama was the man! Black men can be beautiful. Black men can be strong. Dr. Martin Luther King, he wouldn't stop fighting for his dream. He never gave up, so never give up on your dreams either. Check yourself, before you open your mouth, and decide whether its hate, or peace you're all about. First, you're performing at your school, and then, if you win, you go to the regionals. And then the third one is the last one. It's the finals, the district finals. You have the power to change the world too. These are kids getting in front of hundreds of people, and it really gives an opportunity for kids who may not have their talent highlighted in the classroom. For some, we don't know if these are gonna be future politicians or writers. That's the whole purpose of education. We're helping kids to discover their own passions. It's time to stand up against hate. Well, I was not born here. I was born in Sri Lanka. Since last year, I heard about this contest. I was like, "Who is Dr. King?" First of all, I wanted to know that because I just came to America. I didn't know there was this problem with people not being treated fairly. So when I read more about him, I knew more about him. I was like, there's the competition in two weeks. Why not just do one then? Hey, Google. Could you play happy birthday song? Are you eight? Are you nine? - Are you ten? - Stop, stop, stop! It's my birthday. Today, it's my birthday. My mom is like a very good mother. She helps me whenever I need. My dad, he's like the world's best dad ever. He's also like my mom, like, helps me, like, whenever I need help. Sometimes, his volume is the same level. That's why I tell him, "With your volume, up and down is best way." - Calm down. - Okay. Hello, everyone. My name is Karunyan Kamalraj, from Franklin Elementary School. Yes, when you hear the name of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., you, and we all, think of a man who fought segregation and pursued equal rights for black and white Americans. - He know everything. - Yes. Every night, uh, he asking many question, you know, about my country, my relations, my cultural. I compared anti-black sentiment in the United States to my Tamil-speaking minorities in Sri Lanka. Since Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948, civil war caused hundreds of thousands of people were killed and disappeared, including my grandfather. In the wartime, my dad arrested. Until now, we don't know what happened for my dad. Yeah, it's almost... 20 years. Right now, I think, if we had a great leader like Dr. King, we will have not lost hundred thousands of our people. If we had a leader who did what Dr. King did, we would've won equal rights for the Tamil minorities in Sri Lanka. We'll need a leader who is not in love with money but in love with justice, and not in love with publicity, but in love with humanity, like Dr. King. Thank you so much. Yeah, we tried those homework... A lot of times, he spend for his speech, a lot of times, he memorize and polished every word. And then I'm like, "Dad, like, how could I memorize this?" But then I just kept on practicing every single line, and then I finally got it. I always tell him, you need to tell anything from your heart, yeah. That's why it's expression... more expression. Anything you talk has come from your heart. Okay. What I would like to do is to put you in formation today. I'm gonna ask this front row to stand up, just stand up, and take a couple of steps toward me. I want you to spread out this way. More... more. Okay, now, feet together. Hands flat and pressed against your legs, so that the fingers don't start moving around. If those fingers start moving around, you should press harder. Heads straight on your bodies, very important. Stand like soldiers. Soldiers. The oratorical is just like a stand and deliver, and so it's very important about the posture. The posture is just as important as the words. Who are you? Everybody says, "Black Panthers." - Black Panthers! - Looking straight ahead, please. I want you to... to scream it out harder. Who are you?! - Who are you?! - Black Panthers! Very good. The oratorical, for me, is an educational tool because I usually try to pick pieces that are going to teach something about African-American history. In the '60s, we fought to get more black history in the schools. And over the years since then, they have slowly picked out all of the African-American history, and there's nothing left in there except Martin Luther King. So, the oratorical is very powerful in that because it's a venue where they can ask questions about black history where they don't have that opportunity in regular school because those subjects don't come up. These times, there was a lot of police brutality. People couldn't get jobs. A lot of people were angry at the time. And they were determined to accomplish what they needed to accomplish to make things better for everyone. - What's your name, son? - Martín. Martín, turn around and show them the face you just made. We don't just want to be angry inside. We want to show the angry on our faces. Let me see some more angry faces. - We got to rise up! - We got to rise up! - Angry faces. - We got to rise up! We got to rise up! Good, very good. Okay. On your judge's table, you will find the order of performances. There are four sheets. Once we say, "Welcome to the 40th Annual Martin Luther King Oratorical Festival, please do not come talk to the judges or ask questions. We can't divulge scores. And then you'll look to see... What the judges are looking for is the way you deliver it, how you carry yourself. I'm gonna be looking for spirit. I'm gonna be looking for originality. The judges aren't gonna just want to see a robot. - They're looking for talent. - They're looking for confidence. I'm looking for activism. I'm looking for uplift. - And they're looking for... - And they're looking for movement. - They're not looking for... - They're not looking for craziness. I think the judges are looking for... I'm not exactly sure, but I think they're looking for, um... like, the way... Actually, I'm not sure what they look for. It's where they're allowed to be who they are, to get up there, no matter how scared they are, and perform in front of their peers and people they don't know and adults and kids, and, um, it's just always... a warm spot in my heart every time I'm here to see what they produce. Okay, three, two, one. May peace be upon you. - My name is Lamiya Mohammed, - My name is Abrar Mohammed, and today, we will be presenting to you a poem entitled, "Freedom." Let's begin. They sell us freedom, and we buy their chains. We think we become free, but it all remains the same. They game never changed. In fact, the chains are getting tighter because covering up is not okay? They tell me that I'm free, so I shouldn't dress this way? The reason I did this poem was I was told that America was the place where people came to be free. And now people want to ban other races from it. I didn't like it, not a bit. I thought that us Muslims should be welcome here, too. If they should stay, we should too. You believe in every word they tell you, then turn around and you see me. Oh, wait. You don't actually see me. You see my hijabi... We shouldn't be treated differently because of what we look like. I wear a scarf, and I wear it at school too. I've never gotten bullied for it. But when I go out, I've seen people give looks. For example, once, we went to vacation at Pismo Beach, and this random guy yelled out at my mom, saying that she has a bomb. And that's not the thought that hurt my mom's feelings. What hurt her was that nobody else stood up for her. I just want my sisters to feel happy and my family. And I don't want people to tell my mom that she has a bomb. And I just want to feel happy. I come in peace, really. There's no need to disrespect me. I wear what I wear freely, so could you please just let me. All these opinions, bans and restrictions, are really, really starting to get to me. So, here's what we've got to do in order for everyone to be happy and free, including me. I like the way she does it. I like the way she pronounces everything. It's adorable. Well, my note would be more emotion, then when it comes to "That's not fair," that part, to have more sass, 'cause I know that she's good with that. Throughout history, there has been a long list of African-American women who deserve to be recognized. Look me in my face, you'll see I tell no lies. Just wait till I start naming names. Tell me what you know about Bessie Coleman, the first Afri... - Oh, man. I messed up. - No, you did good, babe. I said Bessie Coleman, I meant to say Dr. Mae Jemison. Girl, nobody's gonna know that. You wrote this, they don't know. - You just keep on going. - By the way, you're rocking it. - So, thank you. - You sure are. I'm enjoying this so much. I can't wait to hear it. If you want to start from the beginning, go for it. - But you are rocking it. - And you've been there... When I was in second grade, I did a oratorical and I won, so I thought... It took a long time for me to get to since my first time. But I did really good, so that's when I was like... I had confidence in myself every other time I did it. So, that's why I like doing oratoricals. - Black girl magic. - That's your thing. - Should I start over? - Yes, start over, sweetie. So, what you know about Serena and Venus, Angela Davis, and Nina Simone? Black girl magic and this list goes on. And don't forget about Madam CJ Walker. She invented the hot comb. So, to all my girls out there, even though there may be obstacles, just remember this list because these women did the impossible. Good. Are you performing by yourself? And he's allowed me to go up to the mountaintop. And I've looked over and I've seen the Promised Land. We must fight. Yes, fight, through all this criticism and racism. That's the most important thing, we must fight with love, yes, love! What if Dr. Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech was uploaded on YouTube and shared with millions of people across the world? My name is Madeline Guevara. I'm from La Escuelita Elementary School, and the title of my poem is "En Mis Sueños," by Francisco Alarcón. Buffaloes roam free once again on the plains. Whales become opera singers of the sea... I was kind of nervous, but I just took a deep breath, and did my poem. That's how I relaxed. Mo'Ney, blow out the candle next time. Inhale one, two, three, four... Are you nervous? - Nervous. - Nervous. And I was a little nervous. I'm really nervous about this. I'm really not that nervous. There's gonna be a lot of people. There's chairs up there, chairs right here. There's gonna be a lot of people, that's a big stage. Martin Luther King was like you and me, and he had many dreams. He tried to reach the stars because he knew he would succeed. Injustice anywhere is a threat everywhere. Our lives begin to end the day we become we silent about the things that matter. - We've got to! - We've got to! Put a stop to the violence that will destroy our neighborhood! Destroy our neighborhood! We are the fruits of Fruitvale, beautiful without fail. Our roots run deep like the Oaklandish tree. Stop separating families. Stop trying to silence immigrants. Immigrants and refugees are humans, people just like you and me. Yes, when you hear the name of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., you, and we all, think of a man who fought segregation and pursued equal rights for black and white Americans. They sell us freedom, and we buy their chains. We think we become free, but it all remains the same. The game never changed. In fact, the chains are getting tighter, because covering up is not okay? They tell me that I'm free, so I shouldn't dress this way? Today, my friends, we still have work to do, mountains to climb, obstacles to overcome. We cannot stop striving. Stand like that. Okay... Got you. Good. You ready? Come on in. I have to get my energy up so I can be loud and clear, and I gotta be serious with it also. Tell me what you know about Bessie Coleman, the first African-American woman to receive her pilot license. So, you might look fly, but she was really flying. And I know you know about Oprah Winfrey. She was on your grandma's TV! Like, you know the words... by heart. You know how to say it clearly and loud so everyone can hear, and you don't say it too fast. Everybody really wants us to win. We want to win the competition ourselves. Well, I just feel like we did a really good job. I feel very confident that I'm gonna get at least second or first. We're waiting for the trophy and to see like who's gonna win, 'cause it's been increasing the suspense all day. First place, Crocker Highland Elementary, "ABC's of Life," Myles Staples. Abrar Mohammad. Daddy's here! Feels good. First place! We won first! I mean, I'm proud of them either way. And I was, like, shocked when they were up there, but they did well. - Next week, we're at the finals! - Next week, we're going to the finals. We still continue rehearsing for the finals. We try to improve. These girls are some of the shyest girls I've ever had in life. - Oh! That is... a blessing. - Aw! Oakland is a really diverse town. This is a black, brown, and immigrant city. It's always embraced activists, artists, and folks who... struggle to get by. The history of this place and the history of the various communities that have called this place home is incredible. And just the different intersections, like, if you go downtown, you can really walk through Chinatown, you know, you see the farmer's market, and you keep walking, going over to like Fruitvale. It's probably a long walk, but then you got our Latinx communities. And it's really beautiful to get to know the peoples of this place, and how that proximity to each other makes such a really beautiful experience and just some really wonderful thinkers. Oakland, as a city, is known for its social justice movements and activism. And when people hear Oakland, they think Black Panthers immediately. The goals of the Black Panthers were to give African-Americans, at the time, some sense of hope, and to do something in the community. The kids here might have heard of the Black Panthers, but they don't always know that they started in Oakland, and this gives them a whole nother sense of pride. I want everybody focused on what they're doing. Go up there, get in place, and turn around ready to listen. - Ready? - Yes. One. Don't run. You don't have to run, I count slow. Two. Going on the stage. Nice. I forgot to count it was so nice. These kids have come a long way. I find that they really love doing this. They're very respectful and well-behaved, and I think it's because they really enjoy what we're doing. And when you get lined up, no leaning against a wall, waiting to start. As soon as you get in line, everybody's facing forward, ready to go. Let's not go up here in our voices. Always speak from the diaphragm. Remember, quick with the moves. "We've got to!" - Let me hear it. - We've got to! Yes. It looks like everybody's focusing on... stomping. You don't have to stomp. Attention! Forward march! In the 1960s! In the 1960s! Police brutality! Police brutality! In the black community! In the black community! Was the source! Was the source! Of mounting conflict! Of mounting conflict! We did four minutes and 45 seconds. It's a little close. It's a little close. Let's see if we can run it a little faster, okay? And beat that time. Son, I've been meaning to tell you for a while now, you can't play with those words like, "In the 1960s!" No, no, no, no, no. Brutality was the other one you played with. "Brutality!" Are you singing a song? In the 1960s! In the 1960s! Police brutality! Police brutality! We are opposed to violence! Opposed to violence! Opposed to war! Opposed to war! - Who are you? - Black Panthers! - Who are you?! - Black Panthers! All right, you guys did good. You didn't go over, so you still would win. You still can win, but if you go over, it's out of the question. I'm really proud of them. I think the more history they learned and how we got where we are, makes them a little more positive about what can happen in the future. At least some changes have been made and documented that shows that things can change, and whatever problems we see today, there's hope that that can be worked out in time, and it's not hopeless. Criminals. Animals. - That is not who we are. - All right. My hope is that my students see the power of their voice, and that they know that they can make a difference. This is the first time they've been invited to the finals, and I think it made a difference that like, the poem from them, from their own words and their own feelings. Our parents are hard workers. They have jobs, sometimes more than one. They work long hours to support their families. Immigrants are people with values, patience, respect, responsibility, empathy. America never was America to me. There was one group who did Langston Hughes's, uh, uh, "America..." - "What is America to Me?" - "What is America to Me?" And yet I swear this oath. America will be! I came across this poem, and I think just the refrain of "Let America Be America Again" was really powerful. You know, it was kind of like a reclaiming of making America something that we want it to be. So, it's really exciting to see them take ownership of the poem. Oh, let America be America again! The land that never has been yet, and yet must be... The time is now to say whatever it is that we're feeling. Walking into this oratory fest made me way more hopeful about just change coming. We are at the Greater St. John Missionary Baptist Church. My grandfather is the Rev. Gregory B. Payton. We are right now in our Youth and Tots Center, celebrating Black History Month. Today, I'm gonna be doing the welcome. My welcome is just greeting everybody with a warm-hearted welcome, just to make sure they feel comfortable, to let them know they're in the right place. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning! - Good morning! Our God is great and greatly to be praised. - Amen! - Welcome to the Greater St. John... Gregory is very fond of public speaking. He's a very spiritual young man, at an early age. Um... He loves church and he loves preachers. You are welcome, welcome, welcome. Thank you. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prolific preacher. He was a spiritual shepherd. Dr. King believed in peace and, uh, not harm. He didn't want to harm any person through his life. Even though somebody did harm him, no... he wouldn't harm them. He spoke the word of truth, and what he said, he meant it, like... when he said, "Well, I don't know about... "Well, I don't know what's gonna happen now. We have some difficult days ahead." Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. The part that touched me so much is when he said, the Lord led him to the mountaintop to see the Promised Land. And it really didn't matter with him now 'cause they still were going to have difficult days, like the day after that speech when he got assassinated. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I've looked over, and I've seen the Promised Land. "I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight "that we as a people will get to the Promised Land." That we as a people will get to the Promised Land! Those words are so heart-touching, and things like that. They're so powerful. His words, I don't know about anybody else, but his words are still alive in me, and I will always remember those words. However young you are, you have a responsibility to seek to make your nation a better nation in which to live. Dr. Martin Luther King, he made a legacy. I may not be known. I may just be another kid in this world, but at the same time, I feel like I am somebody. So, because of that, I feel like I have to give my best. I feel like... I'm doing this for him. And I want to say to everybody under the sound of my voice this afternoon that you are somebody. Don't let anybody make you feel that you are nobody. VDr. Martin Luther King was a freedom fighter by using his words. He was able to change a nation by being able to just speak, and I feel that it empowers the students to have a voice. Lifting up student voices, it is a part of fulfilling Dr. King's dream of the power of oration, the power of the word, to create social change. That's how we're gonna create a better world for all. Just last year, two black men were arrested in Starbucks after just waiting for a friend. This led to 300,000 views on YouTube, and anti-bias training at all of their Starbucks stores. Social media, if used the correct way, could be a positive and powerful vehicle for social change and justice. Why do people feel the need to use such a powerful tool to bully, change elections, or separate people within this country? That was good, but make sure we get a pace. I think you're going a little fast, and then there's those little inflections where you really want to let it resonate with the people that this is, this is powerful. My father educates me a lot about what's going on in this world. And he tells me some life lessons, some things I should be careful of, and he gives me a lot of tips and tricks. What I've noticed is some of the young kids, they might not really understand what you're saying... - So the movements help develop the idea. - They understand the visual. Exactly. You bring those both together... There are times where we'll see something on TV and the kids will see it, and a lot of times, they don't ask any questions, but this time, they were both asking questions. Some people are calling for a boycott of Starbucks after seeing this video of two black men being arrested at a Philadelphia location. Essentially, it was two African-American men, I believe it was in Philadelphia, sat down and they were waiting for a colleague for a meeting. Uh, they didn't order anything, and one of the other people in Starbucks said that they felt uncomfortable. So, the manager asked them to leave. There was no reason for them to leave other than the fact that they were black, that was the only reason. I think for our family, it really kind of hit home because those are things that we do. I travel sometimes for work and... - You go to Starbucks. - I go to Starbucks, and, you know, those things could happen to me. So, when that hit here, I think it was important for Donovan to say something about that. - To really understand what was going on in our world. - Absolutely. What if we cared more about gun laws than we did about how many followers we have? What if we talk to each other instead of comment rude things about others? What if we built each other up instead of tear each other down? Well, I just make sure that he understands that there are different situations that he's gonna be treated than his white friends. That's just the way things are right now. Um, and I always tell him there are certain things he won't get, and one of them is the benefit of the doubt. If you're raising an African-American boy in this country, you have to raise him a different way, 'cause there are certain things that he's gonna have to confront that other folks don't. I want to protect you as long as I can from it, but when it happens, I want to make sure you've got the tools to cope with it. I would describe my dad as strong, independent, brave. I don't think we look alike, but I know we act alike. - Time to stand up? - You want to stand up? You can sit down, do it sitting there. Close your eyes, act like you're on stage. It's just you. There's nobody else there. Hi. My name is Lovely Hudson, and I'm gonna be reciting a poem called "What You Know About," written by me. I'm listening. She has the confidence and she has the courage. I tell her that's the big thing is having your courage. So, even with her, like, we'll be at the... I go to my clothing store or I go to my barbershop... "Lovely, do your poem." And I just want her to get adjusted to doing it in front of people. When I say you gotta get into your your happy face, like you're happy. "Oh, it's beautiful outside..." And we were just talking about that today. "The birds, the trees!" And then you got to get... when you're saying something serious, you got to push the button to something serious. Make it your happy face. See a happy face. Sad face. Mad face? - I can't do a mad face, that's hard. - See, you got to know to switch it up. 'Cause like a lot of times, it's not what you say, it's... - How you say it. - Good job. There you go. Go ahead, jump. This way. - Ooh, I'm taller than everybody. - That's okay. You ready? Now, close your eyes and just think. Visualize it. Be loud, but don't yell. Slow down, take your time. You got it. - Go. - Hi. My name is Lovely Hudson... My passion is seeing her doing what she does. When they say unconditional love, that's why I know it's unconditional love 'cause I just want to see... I just get so excited watching her perform. Black girl magic, and this list goes on. And don't forget about Madam CJ Walker. She invented the hot comb. I think important for her is getting up there and just trying your best, and just doing it. You only lose when you don't try. If you try, you're not losing. Even if she went up there and she came in third or whatever she did, if I'm looking at her and I see, and I say, "I know you did... what we practiced, and I know you did your all," that's satisfying. Good job. Fall! Fall! Fall! Fall! Good job, babe. There's something that happens after they've been practicing for weeks. By the time they get to the finals, it's really something. And then when they make it, there's just nothing like it. There's just... just nothing like it. For them to realize, "Wow. I worked hard, and I got rewarded," you know? It's just priceless. Hi. It's the finals, and we're just gonna be competing to get first place, so we can get a medal. Yeah, I'm ready. Like I said, I'm confident. Excited. This is actually my first time hearing about oratorical. It's kind of challenging because we have a lot of other great opponents. My throat, it was hurting this morning, and I was afraid that my voice wouldn't be loud enough. I felt like the journey was a bumpy road, but today, we finally made it to the finish line. Thank you for being here. Thank you for supporting our 40th Annual Oratorical Festival. Are you guys excited? I'm excited. Yes? Okay. We'll start with pre-K through two. Solo performers, no? All right! And she'll introduce herself. Come on up. Good afternoon... Good afternoon. My name is Madeline Guevara. I'm from La Escuelita, and the title of my poem is, "En Mis Sueños." "In My Dreams." Buffaloes roam free once again on the plains. All humans and all living beings Come together as one big family of the Earth. Thank you. We stand together united. This is our chance to repay this debt. We are a land of immigrants, yet we push immigrants like us away. It was fun because a lot of people were watching us and they were thinking that we were good. We've got to move! We've got to move! As Dr. King said, "We may have all come from different ships, but we're all in the same boat now." And that's why it's always the right time to do the right thing. Because in the end, we'll remember - not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. - I felt like gravity was just pushing me down. But I feel better. You think I don't care about this country? I love this country, even though, at times, it doesn't love me back. Ah, well, my daughter is amazing. I am so proud of this baby girl. You make us bleed, and we have to plead. I feel like I did a good job, but then it's like what did the judges think? Today, we are ready as vibrant, beautiful girls, full of potential! And tomorrow, we'll be vibrant, beautiful women, full of potential! About to take the stage, "To Walk in the Way of Dr. King." Let's show some love. Today is one of the greatest day in my life because I have another chance to think about one of the greatest people in my life and in the world. Yes, when you hear the name of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., you, and we all, think of a man who fought segregation and pursued equal rights for black and white Americans. He is the man who changed the history of the United States. He is the man who changed the mind of many Americans. He is the man who cultivated seeds of love in everyone's heart. About to take the stage, Joaquin Miller School. "What If." Social media, if used the correct way, can be a positive and powerful vehicle for social change and justice. What if we cared more about gun laws than we did about how many followers we had? What if we built each other up instead of tear each other down? Lovely, are you in the house? All right. Come on and take the stage, Miss Lovely. All these black women stepped up and changed the game! We have billionaires, athletes, musicians, astronauts, and pilots, and that's just to name a few! So, you can't tell me black women are not intelligent, powerful, innovative, and beautiful, too! So, to all my girls out there, even though there may be obstacles, just remember this list 'cause these women did the impossible! Thank you, Lovely. So, what's the most powerful weapon we have? Yes, the power of our pens, our books, our creative minds, and critical thinking working together. So, Piedmont Avenue... ..."A Tribute to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." Are you ready, Gregory? Come on and take the stage. Take the stage! Good afternoon. My name is Gregory Payton. I will be reciting a tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., compiled by Zerita Sharp. The Lord is my shepherd! I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me besides the still waters! He restores my soul! He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake! Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification! I will fear no evil for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me, in the presence of my enemies! You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over! Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now because I've been to the mountaintop! And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place, but I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go up to the mountaintop. And I've looked over, and I've seen the Promised Land! I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land. All right. So, I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life! And I... will dwell in the house of the Lord forever! Thank you. What you saw was him taking that linguistic tradition that came across with African people. That you heard in his voice, that lilting cadence, that lifting that comes only from internalizing. It's a gift from the ancestors. You can speak, and he articulated well. He did all of that. But he brought more than that. He brought what you hear in the African community. In the diaspora, and today, the diaspora in Oakland, California, spoke with the blessing of the ancestors. So, I... I mean, I just had to get up and walk. I just could not contain myself. This was just... I just... I just... I just... What can I say? Ashay. So, the moment we've all been waiting for. You guys ready? We'll start with the category of published poetry. So, pre-K through two. First place, La Escuelita, "En Mis Sueños." La Escuelita, are you still here? Yes, come on down! Congratulations. Third through fifth grade... Second place. Fifteen performers. Third through fifth grade, published poetry, Aspire College Academy, "Phenomenal Woman," first place. All right! Congratulations. Third to fifth grade speeches. "What If," Joaquin Miller School, first place. Original poetry, third through fifth grade, Bridges Academy at Melrose. Second place. Markham, "The Black Panthers." First place. I was so excited. I was like, please give me first place. I just... came here, and I was like, oh my God, I did it! Carl B. Munck, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Second place. I would have to say I was crushed. It was heart-breaking. We were so happy when we got first place in the semi-finals, and then once we got second place in the finals, we just sank. We thought we were good as last time, and the time before, but I guess the judges didn't think that. Yeah. Lovely Hudson, "What You Know About." First place. All right, Lovely! "The Fruits of Fruitvale." Second place. "A Tribute to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." Gregory, first place. Go, Johnny! Come on, here we go. Oh, that is such an amazing photo. It's amazing what's coming out of the hearts and minds of young people today. They're profound and they're intelligent, and they have a vision, and given the opportunity to share and to listen, there's so much to learn. Somebody said that no revolution is complete without its poets. The large part of social movements is art, and imagining new just possibilities. The power of the word is all you need is a pen and pencil, and a circle to share it, and that's where the magic happens. Tired, hungry, but it's well worth it. Seeing her smile and, you know, just onto the next year. New material and just do it again.
