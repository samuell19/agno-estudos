Fuck. Pablo! Yes, Ms. Lucy, what's the matter? Sweetheart, your daddy... what time does he get home? Ina while. I can't let you in, I'm in a towel. I just wanked to return those Ginsus I borrowed the other day. I don't know what a Ginsu is Ms. Lucy. You know, those steak knives... And invite him over for drink too. I don't know, Ms. Lucy. Don't worry, honey. When is your girlfriend coming over again? She's not my girlfriend. Right, she's not very pretty. The other day I saw her smooching with one of those boys playing hard to get. Yeah, Mari. But don't worry, honey, you're gorgeous. You'll have lots of girlfriends. Thanks, Ms. Lucy. I have to go now, OK? Tell your dad! Sure. Not so late though cause I have lots to do Sure, sure. Bye. Hi! Hi! Hello. Hi. Yes. Around 9 p.m. Don't bother, I'm too old for presents. Sure. I love wine. One, two. Kick. Three, four. Step and tum. Step and tum. Step and tum. Step and tum. Attitude! Bend down. One, two, three, four. Again! Five, six, seven and... One, two, three, four and... You remember those old bottles? Of course! Garrafa was 5 Its And 15 Its? 15 Its was... Damajuanal No, that was 10 Its. Chuica was 15 Its No, that was 5 lts Juanito, for fuck's sake! Garrafa 5lts, Damajuana 10lts, Chuica 15 lts... Chuica! That's what I said. You are one dumb girl. Come on, he's really cute. Look at him. Don't make him notice. What about you? Who were you smooching with? You didn't tell me, you bitch! Tell me! Who was it? Please. I cant... Why not? We're going up, the Carrasco brothers down... When is our next delivery due? Right, you have to go check that out. They're always fine, though. Fucking Chinese, they work like one hundred times faster than us making those mannequins. Koreans... They're screwing up the world. But you know where they'll never screw us? Our humanity. Excuse me. Hey, so when's the audition? Saturday. Are you nervous? Nope. I was born to be famous so judges and those type of things don't scare me Pablo... What the fuck are you doing here? What? What the fuck, man. Are you into this shit now? This dude told me there'd be booze. Oh, so you buy into what “The Girl” says now? Damn man, I'm kidding. Hey, listen, I think you better leave. Shut the fuck up, dyke. I like Pablito. See? Hey dude. Let me go! Hey, I'm leaving. Hey Pablito, let me borrow your Playstation, man. Whatever. I do get it, Mari. Your dad wouldn't do anything. He's clueless. He gets it alright. He's just playing dumb. I don't really care. You're beautiful. Don't be silly... That asshole. Hat 2 dumb-ass. You think I can't defend myself? Have you seen yourself? That's mean. The movie's over. You hooked up with Félix. Yes. Boss. Can I come in? Tell me. I'm going out. Need anything? A coffee? A Hot Dog? No, thanks. I have to go to the bank in a bit. Alright. Go, go. I don't really understand. It's just that we want to make some changes in the company. Expand a little. Right, what I don't understand is why is all the paperwork under the name of a Mr. Saulmann? The legal constitution, the Commerce Registration inscription... Didn't you bring the commencement of activities paperwork? No. Exactly what do you do in the company? Are you an employee? Look. Bruno, Mr. Saulmann, and I we've been partners for a thousand years. But, sir, if 1 don't see that anywhere here how do I know you're going to invest this credit in the company? Cause I've worked there for over 25 years. What else would I use that money for? Look, you may well be partners with Mr. Saulmann but for me the only thing that matters is what's accountable on paper. You're asking for a credit as if you were a business owner but you're an employee. Besides, if you are partners with Mr. Saulmann why isn't he here? Where is he? Britney Spears leaves a $100 tip. That rich bitch. Man... That's cool, though. Cool. It's Britney... Does this come with 2 horoscope? "Sagittarius: It's a key time to plan the future you desire" and take that first step. "It's & time of meetings and farewells. Go for it." Awesome, right? What luck! My friend. You'll do great. I know. I've practiced a lot. Want me to go pick you up when you're done? No. Why not? Cause I have stuff to do. Like what? Is Félix going to pick you up? This looks yummy, I'm hungry... Hey! Is Félix going to pick you up? Should we cook this? Is Félix going to pick you up? Yes. Hey. I said “Hey” man. Is Martin around? Ask "the Girl" about the Playstation, man. Fuck off. Jeez, it's a joke, dude. He's in his room. Hey, but seriously! Martin? Come in! What's up? The Shark of Recoleta! Do you have 2 cigarette? What? After exercising? Sure. Desert. Give me a cigarette. You should buy your own. Why? I have you for that. So, what is up, Félix. Good. Kind of tired. Lazy as fuck. Must be all that partying. The other day you were at “The Girl's” place, right? Yeah. What were you doing there? I fucking live next door. My aunt nagged and nagged... I thought I could get some booze out of it, I don't know. Oh. Sure. I'm just messing with you. But don't hang out with him. He plays around with little kids on the street. That's sick. I know. Can I borrow this movie? No. Come on. I said no. OK. Take it, it's boring anyway. Alright. So we're going, right? Yeah, man. What do you mean? We are going! We'll just go and chat with these guys. Christopher is a brilliant guy, man. You'll see. The other day he said this thing... about knowing how to "adopt culture”. Versus not having ideas, you know? Values... Principles. Cool. I fucked this girl Danitza yesterday... she left me with a backache, man. Crazy bitch. Let's go, I have to drop off Yosi before we go. And tell that faggot about the Playstation I'm sick of Rodrigo asking for it. Hey, Girl! What's up Martin? Is that make-up you're wearing? I was out dancing. Right... So? Did you take it up the ass? Yes. Yeah, I took it up the ass. Right. Come on, its just 3 joke. I know. Take a joke like a man. What's with the face? What face? That face, fucker. Leave me alone, OK? "Leave me alone, OK?" I'll leave you alone when I want. And I'll beat the shit out of you when I want. You want me to beat the shit out of you? No. No, I have to go. Hey, we're just talking here. You look real cute with your make up on. Sleep tight. Fucking faggot. Asshole... Lucy, it's 11 am. And I have to go to work. I can't start drinking. Its Saturday. Fine. Give me a second. Tell some assistant to do something. Sure, my army of assistants... I'm going to make a call. Let me get my cellphone. Smartphone. Oh, hi! Hi. How are you? Fine. Ah, here it is. This one's mine, dad. What happened? Nothing, 1 fell down last night at Galaxy. Where? Galaxy. My shoes were untied and I fell It was really stupid. Why didn't you put your arms out? I couldn't. You think I wanted to fall down? Jesus, fine. I just wanted to know if you were OK. I'm fine, dad. Ah, I found it. Hey, didn't you have an audition one of these days? I didn't go. It was today. Why not? What do you mean "why not"? Look at my face. So what? Whatever, it's not like I'm going to get rich or something. I mean, you could at least try, right? You should take advantage of those things. What? That's the key. No one's going to hand you opportunities. You have to take them. I'm off now. You actually believe that shit? Of course I dot! OK, answer this then: Why do you think Chile is doing great? Because of people like me, who work everyday, even on weekends, who take advantage of opportunities. I don't stay at home resting. Sure. Cause Chile's doing so great. I'm so proud of being a Chilean Viva Chile! But... Hello. Yes, this is he... Hey, hey, hey. And you, mister? What have you been up to? Nothing, just chillin'. “Chillin'... What? What? What? I's nothing. You know you can do whatever you want, I won't give you a hard time. But... I wish you'd get a girlfriend It's about time. I'm going to study now aunt, OK? Sure, the last thing I want is to be a bother. Just tell me one thing... Come, come. Is there any girl you like? No aunt, I don't like anyone. Hi dad. Hey! Didn't you go out last night? Yes, but... Look at me... There's dinner for you on the table. OK. Good night. Come, Mari, If you weren't a girl, I'd do you. I'm not a girl. I'm macho, see? A boxer. You lock amazing. I love it. Hello, how are you? Fine. Hey, what time do you get here? In an hour? You had to pass by the factory? You're going to cook something nice? Great. Sure, I'll go. What do you need? Sure. Yes, cool. Thanks, dad. You're the best dad in the world. I love you very much. Take care. I'm fucked. Whatever, you look amazing. I love it. Me too. Show yourself! No! OK, fine. Check out that guy... Let's turn around. Let's go... Run! Get him! Fuck! He's fast. You're alright, man... Nice hair, Barbie. Shut up, fucking faggot. Get up, it wasn't that bad. Stand up! Hey. Hey. Come on, get up! You're such a pussy. Shut up, fucking homo. Shut up, faggot. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Stop! Please! Shut the fuck up! Just shut up. Stop! Stop! Please! Stop! Félix... Félix, help me! Move... What are you doing? Let's go. Let's go, man. Fucking faggot. Hello. Yes, stable. No, we don't know yet. A couple of days... I don't know. No... thanks. OK. Thank you. Yes, thank you for calling. I just ran. So you're telling me you did not see the defendants attack Pablo with your own eyes? No. You do understand that without witnesses, Or previous records, jail is a long shot, right? I understand the anger you're going through. God knows I do. But I have to ask you to have faith. Those boys deserve to be in jail. And that's what we're aiming for, OK? This system... The system doesn't make things easy. Warranty judges control the district attorneys we have to help the district attorney. And... And the second facial-trauma plastic surgery The first operation comes out to be 4 million 346 thousand pesos. And the second facial surgery amounts to... 5 million, 138 thousand pesos. I see your son just turned 18. Wait, no... Your plan covers only 15% of hospitalization and surgery caused by accidents or aggression by third parties. Sir, you should have told us about his age. Or you could've switched to our Golden Plan which does cover what you are asking for. Give me a second. Let me do the math with these new numbers, applying the 15% coverage... Making it 2 grand total of 8 million 58 thousand pesos. Naturally, you can pay them in 36 installments. How... I don't understand. Why doesn't the refund apply? Your plan covers up to 15% in case of aggression cause by third parties. Listen, my son just turned 18. Just now. Doesn't that make a difference? No, no. It has nothing to do with your son's age, it has to do with what you payed for, you see? Yes, but I've been paying for 6 years in case something like this happened. Yes, Yes. If you have any complaint you can go to Customer Service. They're open from 9012, Or you can do it through our web page. I'm writing the details down for you. They will get back to you within 48 hours. Have a nice day, Sir. What's so funny? Looks like you're a little slow. Let me try. How am I supposed 10 know you have to hit it? That's how men think. What are you having? I thought nurses were supposed to be friendly. Latte. Nurses are. But not doctors. Oh! So you're the one taking all my money. That's right. I'm very, very evil. Here you go. Thank you. So what are you doing here? Hitting on nurses? No. So what then? I'm here for my son. He's in room 23. Ah. I heard about that. And how is he? How can you charge so much for something like this? Aren't you ashamed? Akid in a coma! Maybe for you it's not much money, but what do I do? And what do you know? Why do people with children feel so superior to everyone else? It's so irritating! Sorry, I can be a bit rash. That was very rash, I apologize. No, you're right. I don't know a thing. I don't even know exactly what happened to my son. Those assholes lied about everything. Did you know the boys that attacked your son? Couldn't you have done something to protect him? Do you even have children? No. You can't be there for them all the time, not all the time, you see? Work can consume you... What do yo do for a living? I make mannequins. I make sure they're well-made, without errors. So you're the reason why women feel like disgusting fat asses when we go shopping? And the mother? His mom... I didn't want to... I was much older than her when we met... And then she... But anyway, that was a long time ago. And he turned out to be... He's like the opposite of me. He likes the same music I used to listen to, and that's about it. I have to cancel his tuition tomorrow. What did he study? Sorry. I mean, what does he study? Dance. I don't know what it's called, really. Dance... Ballet. That's really nice. When he was small, I showed him a picture of himself where hie had 2 limp wrist, at a birthday party. Your classmates are going to make fun of you, I told him. He looked at me with such a sad face, I'll never forget it. After that, I never really knew... what to say. I owe you a coffee. Oh, by the way, we aren't flirting. That's impossible, right? Very impossible. A coffee it is, then. Just as friends. I'm off. Or else I'll have a hard time at home again. “You're always late! You're never home! Work this, work that..." If anything happens to your son, give me a call. The last thing I need is people thinking I'm in this for the money. Thank you. Open up... Come in, then. Come on! And... Juan, are you there? Are you there? What do you need, Lucy? Are you OK? Are you OK? No. Juan... Listen... it's OK. Come here. Pablito will be fine. I know it can be difficult but that's what close ones are for. Anytime you need anything, you can come to my place. Pablito is strong. You have a beautiful boy. He just has to be more careful. Félix too. He needs to stay away from those boys. Those boys... They should be in jail. I told those morons they shouldn't be mean to Pablo just cause he was... well, different. You know... Juan... some time ago I saw him dressed up like a woman. I didn't even want to mention it cause it's none of my business. But I'm telling you because I care. I--- Wait, wait, wait. You told those little shits that you had seen Pablo dressed as a girl? No... I mean... I told them to be nice to him that they should take care of him cause he was different. Did you tell them? Yes or no? No! Of course I didn't! Why would I pry into Pablo's things, or anyone else's? Why? Because you're a pathetic old woman. Dancing and shit at your age. Who do you think you are, prying into my son's life lock how he ended up! Why would I pry into your fives! Well, you do! You do. Or you think I haven't seen you snooping this way? Why would I be snooping on you people?! You know what... I'm leaving. Get out of here, you spying hag! And don't come back! I'm leaving! And stop trying to come on to me. - You think I'll get it on with you? - Sure! Cause you're the best catch, right? With those ridiculous clothes. You don't work, don't do anything! Even a faggot's life is worth more than yours! It's just that... I feel funny about that... The thing is... I feel kind of funny about that, It's just that... you know what? I feel funny about that. What's the matter, damn it! My boy... I'm so proud you turned out to be so tall, good-looking, because those things matter in the long run. Me, on the other hand... Nothing worked out for me. But, Grandpa, don't say those things. You did good yourself, right? Sure, but.. I was 0 damn poor. But happy, right? Your son, did he tum out tall too? No, not as much. Oh, but he looks like a gringo too, right? No, he is more dark-skinned. Back when I was a kid when I went to Petorca... must've been around... I don't remember when... Grandpa? What? I don't know... But who's going to know if you don't? This damn kid! Can we talk? Juan, I spoke to Felix,. He told me he tried to protect Pablo... Juan, let me in, please. I believe him. We've been neighbors for ages. How could he do something like that? And what is that supposed to mean? Next time? Next time they'll definitely go to jail? Next time they beat the shit out of my son? Which next time? Sure, sure. And I guess you'll be charging me anyway, right? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Hello? Bruno. Ah! Right, of course. You're right. Good thing you reminded me. Yes, I'm taking it easy. Thanks. OK. Around 9 at your place, then? OK. See you. Bye. Cheers! Juanito I wanted to tell you... more like thank you for all these years you've been with me. Really, I can't say how much they mean to me. I really wanted you to come cause I wanted to tell you something that's made me very happy. And I hope it's a good thing for you too. Last Saturday I met again with the Carrasco brothers. And we decided to merge. OK... Turns out, they were doing a lot better than what I thought Especially with their distribution which perhaps is our weakness Basically, this means we'd merge two things, right? The factory with their distribution operation. The best part of all is they are going to handle everything. I know this isn't exactly what you wanted but I can't imagine a better opportunity for you to invest that money you've telling me about. I think this will be really, really good for both you and me. So let's have another... Wait. I don't get it. What do you mean “exactly” what I wanted? What do you mean? This has nothing to do with what I wanted. How can you sell the whole god damn business without telling me? Selling? What are you talking about? What do you mean, what am I talking about? How many times have you told me "I want to be a partner,” I want to be an entrepreneur, 'I want to be independent.” Well, this is fucking it. I mean, it's not going to be like before but you'll be partners with the Carrasco brothers! An entrepreneur! What do you say? I can't believe this. I cant. You know what surprises me the most about your fucking betrayal? Shut up! Shut up! It's that I'm not surprised at all. And how do you plan on competing against the Chinese? Koreans, moron. Juan! Juan... Hey. Hey! Wait. I'll take you home, OK? You're upset! Pablo is still at the hospital. Listen, I understand. I swear I do. I know it's intimidating being alone for the first time. Wait, wait, let me get the keys. Just wait there. Juan, let's talk this over. Here. You drive. Really. You wanna try out a BMW? I swear, it's relaxing. It is. It's like taking Valium. Juan, I understand you. I really do. I remember [ was on & plane once to Argentina, I think, I don't remember and I started opening that little bag of peanuts they give you so you won't starve to death and this old broad next to me, argentinian, goes “Could you stop making that noise?” And I thought, fuck, we have turbines right next to us... Where the fuck are you going with this story? Sometimes you have a loud noise next to you but the thing that bothers you is the little peanut bag And problems are just like that. You're stressed. With Pablo in the hospital I understand, and yet, this is something small. It's nothing! [ Trust you... And this? And this? Is this not a small thing? - And this isn't a small thing? - What are you doing? You resentful prick! Get the fuck off of me. Félix! Aren't you going to say anything? Hi, sir. My aunt told me you stole a car, is it true? If it were up to me, you'd be in jail. But I know it was that son of a bitch that's responsible. OK. Just tell me what you want. I want you to tell me why you didn't do anything. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't do this to me, asshole. Tell me what happened. Look, sir, I told everyone, I told my aunt, [ told everyone I was just passing by. No, no, no! Tell me what happened! What happened with what? I know, OK? I know! What do you know, sir? What? You're wasting my fucking time, sir. I'm not stupid! I know that you and Pablo... What? What?! What do you want, that I start crying and say what? That your son's a faggot and someone was going to beat him up any day now? It doesn't matter who did it, asshole! It doesn't matter! Martin was helping him become a man while you were in your stupid factory with your stupid mannequins Pablo was a bigger faggot everyday. And where were you? Locked up in your stupid factory. He was hanging out with that dyke, he'd play around with children. On top of that you stole a car? What do you want? You people have no fucking principles. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? You and that fucking gringo beat the shit out of & kid! My son! He could die! Look, I have to leave. Please, tell me. Tell me what happened. I don't know what you're talking about, sir. I'm talking about... you and Pablo being... Don't mess with me, you old fuck. Ah, you're going to hit me now, you little shit? I've known you since you were... No, no. I don't want anything to do with this. I even thought I could get raped. Besides, they're waiting for me in the car. Nobody knows we know each other. It'll be as if you felt sorry for a child. This is too weird. It's a scam. Do you think I'm that dumb? It's not a scam! What is it then? It's my money! Ana, please help me. I don't even know you! Where did you get this money? I've worked there for over 25 years! I was scammed, don't you see? That asshole will probably have me accused and I have no time left. My son doesn't have any time left! That's your responsibility! It's none of my business. I have no children, I don't want children My life's just fine. It won't be your responsibility, it's just a formality. Please, pay the hospital bills. I have to leave for some time. Meanwhile... I don't want him to suffer. My woman is going to kill me. Thank you. I'd kind of get married. And who would you marry? Some girl... I've had girlfriends. I like girls. Woman, please. Bitch, you're so prejudiced! Can you get a hard on with a girl? Yes. Liar! Oh, and why not? Because you're super gay? Oh, what do you know? I know. I don't find myself that gay. I guess I am really gay. I love you. Me too. Want anything? No. What? You want another kiss? No. I love you. I love my dad too... And that idiot, Félix. I'm happy, you know? You're beautiful. I'll never leave you on your own. Me neither.
