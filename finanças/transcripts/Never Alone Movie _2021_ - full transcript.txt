The hardest part of the lockdown for me was... just being... you know, before the lockdown, everything was free, like I could leave my house, I could do whatever I wanted. I was looking forward to everything we were gonna do with the band. Like, I was in the middle of a show for my high school musical. Just one month ago, I was out in San Diego with my friends and we were having a really good time. And then one month later, everything's locked down and then the whole world's going crazy and I don't know what to do. My friends are literally my life. And when that happened, I felt very, very alone. I definitely felt very lonely. I definitely felt lonely. It kind of felt like... the world was telling you that you couldn't live your life. Being a high schooler, friends is all of your high school and so not having their support, you feel very alone. Tonight, there's concern as COVID cases rise in nearly half the country. We turn now to the Coronavirus pandemic. There are new concerns about another surge in infections. The number of cases in the US is nearing 30 million and the death toll has topped 545,000. And for the first time in weeks, the CDC's national ensemble forecast is predicting deaths will not decline. In L.A. County for teachers and for students, just how best to respond to the Coronavirus outbreak. L.A. County public schools announcing that they will be shutting down, effective Monday. How that's going to play out with the hundreds of thousands of students, we don't yet know right now. - Mom? - Um... Yeah, I just don't think it's gonna be possible. - Mom? - Well, I'll talk to Jesse, see what's happening with her schedule. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi! Like the car? Yeah, I like it. Careful, Brielle. Have you been practicing singing all summer? - A little bit. - Just a little bit? My siblings get pissed at me when I sing too loud. Oh. That's what I love about your voice. - Thanks. - Yes. - It's very loud. - It's a strong voice, for sure. - I'm excited to see everyone. - Me too. I missed all of you so much. Well, why don't you get started with warm ups - and I'll see you soon, okay? - Okay. - I gotta hop on that. - Do your thing, do your thing! It's been so long. Warm! Oh, it's warm. Eh! Eh!

Did you work on your song? It's a little bit rough. That's okay. Let's hear it. So when are we getting a real music teacher? Are we going to get one eventually?

Do we have a second verse? Not yet. We're still trying to figure out who's story. Yeah. Basically, the idea is that the queen's song inspires the kids of the forest. Kids of the forest? Yes, that is what we are calling our lovely dancers. Okay. The queen is under some sort of spell, but she needs to break out of it, but we don't really know how yet. Maybe it's love. That could be it. Well, work on the story first and then come back - to the music later, okay? - Oh, Mary, are we doing this the night of prom? Yes, if I can find you a teacher by then, that is the plan. Okay? I'm gonna go work with strings and I will see you all after lunch. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mary! Do you want to work on the story at lunch? - Me? - And Amy. Sure. - You going to the pier? - Yeah. - See you there. - Let's go. Bye. Ooh, you going to the pier? - Nate just asked you out. - Shut up! Hey, we were gonna go work during lunch, is it okay if we do this later? Kim Lacey saw you at the last showcase. Kim Lacey? What did she say? She's interested in representing you. She's bringing the head of the agency to see you - in the next showcase. - Wow. You worked hard for this. You deserve it. We don't even have a music teacher, is there going to be someone to help us with this? Don't even worry about that. I will find you a music teacher and in the meantime, - I'm here for you. - Okay. Okay. Mary? This is gonna be a good opportunity for all of us, like, we're all gonna be performing - at the showcase, right? - Yeah, sure it is. Do me a favor, don't tell anybody about this. I understand. But this is your time to shine. You can't take everybody with you. - Okay. - Get out here. Bye. - Sup, guys? - Hey, Matt. How you doing? How you doing, bro? You know, she was trying to help you, right? - Who was? - Brielle. - With what? - With Amy! She brought up prom so you could take Amy to prom. No, she wasn't. You gotta learn to read between the lines, man. - Brielle's smart like that. - She's hot, too. Dude, I'm actually scared of her. She's crazy! She's a crazy hot. She's hot. But she might stab you. Crazy hots are my thing, man. She's coming. Okay, put that shit away, man. Okay, forget it. Let's smoke it over there. - Don't. - Look, relax. Do me a favor, just don't leave, man. I got you, man. Hey, Gary, come here. I wanna tell you something. What is it? Is it good? Is it good? Is it bad? Is it something about me? - Gary? - Be right back, okay? Have fun. - Hey. - Oh, hey. What's up? Uh, not much. Um... Um... Are you hungry? I'm hungry. Oh, but it's kind of pricey. Maybe we can grab, like, a hot dog. I don't eat hot dogs. Oh, uh... Maybe... I think there's a pizza place nearby. Hey, it's okay, I'm not hungry. Oh, um... So what were you thinking? About what? The story... that we're writing. Oh, right, the queen story, - Right. - Yeah, uh... I think we make it like more romantic. Really? Yeah, I wrote this song. It's not done yet. It kind of reminds me of you. But if you want to hear it, we can... Sure. Okay. - You have headphones? - Yeah, uh... - this one's mine. - Those are weird headphones. This one's yours. - Just simple ballad. - I can see what you mean. - Could be a duet, too. - Yeah. - So you get the idea, right? - Yeah, kind of. So like in general, what do you think that she wants? Uh... She wants... friendship, uh... romance. What else? I guess someone... she can trust. Okay. Someone she can share her secrets with. I like that. Maybe we should hear it again. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Good idea. Like a motif. - Yes! - It keeps coming back. Yeah, I like that part a lot. So did you guys do anything? No. You just sat there listening to music the whole time? Mh-mm. I mean, at least a couple of hours. And then we realized it was already dark. You are so in love. It is disgusting. I'm not in love. I just like him, okay? You know you used to hate him because he ignored you. He's not ignoring me now. Did he ask you to be his girlfriend? No. But he's coming over tonight. What? What am I supposed to do? We're just going to listen to music. I invited Gary too. Gary, get ready, we're going to go to Amy's house. Gary. Gary, why is this door locked? Open the fucking door! What are you doing? Yes, you say that shit every time! - Piece of shit! - Get the fuck away from that! You piece of shit! I'm gonna kick the fuck out of you. I didn't mean to! Yeah, you say that shit every time. Get up! Get up, you fucking waste of piece of shit! - This is it? - Yeah. - You ready? - Uh-huh. This is gonna change everything. - No pressure. - Come on. Let's do it. Go. - Hey. - Hey. What happened last night? I'm sorry about that, I... fell asleep. What are you guys doing? Oh, we're, uh, we're going to skate park. Do you want to come with? I can't. My mom's not feeling too well. Oh damn, I'm sorry about that. - I hope she feels better. - Thanks. Okay, then I'll, um... see you Monday. Yeah. - Yeah. - Have fun. Hey, Amy? Um... do you want to go to prom? I am going. Yeah, but, like, with me? Like, as your date? Yeah, kind of, I guess. Well, actually, the girls were all planning on going together. You'd rather go with them than with me? Yeah, kinda... I guess. Are you mad about something? It's just the way that you say things. It's not clear. Like the way that you're writing the queen in the play. Does she want friendship or romance? It's not clear, and if it's not clear, she's going to get frustrated and confused, so... All right, um, how about this? I want you to be my date at the prom. And I want you to be my girlfriend too. - Is she crying? - No, she's laughing.

You gotta get used to it. Came by your house last night. What time? Right around the time your dad was losing his shit. I'm gonna head out. It's getting late. Hold up, man. Thanks. The pandemic is far from over. New Coronavirus infections are on the rise across the nation. Mask mandates are returning in some places and city... What's wrong? You're just like your father. You ball everything up inside. What is it? Nothing, I told you. Just this... girl I'm thinking of. Of course you are. You're a young man, you're tempted by the sharmutas. Sharmutas, I... don't think she's a sharmuta. Whatever that is. Is she pretty? Yeah, she's pretty. She can skate too, better than Gary. And when a day goes by where you can't see her... you feel it, don't you? Totally. - Hey. - Hey. Did you think about what I said? What's that? About being my girlfriend. You were being serious? You thought I was joking? You're always joking. I'm not, I'm serious. Really? So what do you think? I'll let you know when I see you at school. On Monday. Give me a hint. Come on. Nope. Fine. Um... Okay, I'm just gonna call, I guess. - Yeah, you gotta call them. - I... I am. Hi, it's Brielle. Um, the front gate's closed. Oh, okay, thank you. They are going to send someone out. You look worried, man. - No, I'm not. - About what? Nothing. Tell me. Nate's getting married. What are you talking about? He proposed to Amy, and she's officially accepting today. - You asked her out? - Yeah. Oh no, no, no. He didn't just ask her out. He went up on her front porch and announced, "Amy", "darling, I want you to be my girlfriend." And she didn't answer? Well, she wanted to wait to do it in person. But she was in person. Well, you know Amy, she wants to, like, think things through. Why are you guys looking at me like that? Okay, well, if she says yes, then you have to kiss her. - Yeah. - Yes. A first kiss says everything. Stop! Stop! - Hi. - Good morning. I'm really sorry we didn't get the word out sooner, but there's no school today. The staff is meeting about how to handle this new... - virus thing. - Are you serious? They might need to close for a while to keep you guys safe. So what are we supposed to do? My mom's at work. Where am I supposed to go? Yeah, I know, it's a mess. They'll send out an email to your parents later today. I'm really sorry. How long do you think it'll be?

And really sad. Oh, thanks. The last time I saw you was where? At the expo, right? Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much for being here. - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, so I have really good news. Your test came back negative. - Yeah. - Oh! So, you're hired. You can start tomorrow. - Oh, wow. - Our first class is at 9 am. I know you must be a little bit nervous because you've never worked with kids before, and I totally understand. But you're an amazing musician and I want you to be really confident in this role. Like... What's wrong? You're just sitting on my notebook. Oh, oh, sorry. No, no, it's okay. So here is the schedule for the rest of the year. To enter the building, you'll have to get tested each week and we can work around those dates you mentioned. Yeah, I'm gonna go see my mom. Yeah, that's not a problem. The most important thing is they have a really important showcase coming up. A major agency is coming and it should be a big deal, but I'm having a hard time getting them excited about it. Yeah. Shame. It must be really hard for musicians right now, right? Yeah, that's kind of why I'm here. And thank you so much for being here. The kids are going through the same thing. They've been stuck at home, literally in lockdown for months now. - Mm. - Yeah. I'm seeing a bunch of contact info here. Everything's on Zoom? Yes, it means everything is on Zoom. Did you not know that? No, I didn't. - That'll be interesting. - Yeah? Uh, what about these instruments? Do they play them still? Oh no, not anymore, obviously. You're welcome to use them, but... - they won't be here. - Okay. Yeah, so grab the sheet and let's get your paperwork ready. All right. Let's do this. So the ninth, that's when I start? No, tomorrow. With the number of positive COVID tests increasing dramatically, government officials have extended the lockdown orders for another six to eight weeks. Lines continue to grow... Hey, Gary. Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. You? Nothing. You wanna play League? No, I'm trying to write something for our new music teacher. You got that email, right? Yeah. It's probably some old fuck even worse than the last guy. Not possible. I mean, what kind of name is that, Mr. Lars? Sounds like a German tuba player. What I wrote is so dumb. Let's hear it. All right, I wrote, "Almost had a girlfriend. And then my life ended." I like that. I like that. It's a crock of shit, bro. I'm, like, losing my mind in here. All right, man, I'll see you on Zoom tomorrow. Catch you later, man. Peace. Mr. Lars, this is a school. There's no smoking allowed. Smoking? We have security cameras. Thank you. Sorry. It won't happen again. Good morning, Mr. Lars. Uh... Good morning. Um... I'm Daryl. Uh, Mr. Lars, um, Daryl Lars. I'm your new music teacher. Um... What was that that you just played? It's just something I'm writing for somebody special. For your girlfriend? Actually, my mom. Your hair is dope. Thanks. So, I don't really know how this Zoom thing works too well, it's my first time on here, so bear with me. Um, can you guys hear me okay? Yes. Maybe we should talk about our assignment. It's a great idea. Um, let's talk about it. Do you play anything besides piano? Yeah, cello, bass, guitar and violin. Snooky Young says real musicians play jazz. You mean like this? What about classical? Any more questions? All right, so let's start this class, um. Tell me what you guys can do. - Amy sings. - Just Amy? We all sing. They're just being shy. 'Kay, um, how about you, um, Stephen? Uh, I play the piano, but I suck. Gary and I play the guitar. How long have you guys been practicing? Well, I don't know if you've heard, but there is this pandemic going around called COVID, so we're basically in prison. Yeah. Can't you see these bars around us? I can't take it, let me out! I know the actor is. Uh, so who can tell me what this play's about? It's about this queen who's trying to find something. - She's searching for love. - Whoa we did not agree on that. Well, she's searching for something. Well, if it was love, she would have said it was love. Why is this so complicated? Hold on. Uh... Let's try this, whenever... whenever I'm confused, you know, it helps to play. So, let's try that. The only way it works, though, is if you, you know, sing about something you've experienced yourself, you know? - Something real. - Like what? Like... Pain from a breakup or... when your family member turns their back on you. What if it's something you don't really wanna talk about? We all have stuff like that, um... You just have to decide if it's something you're willing to share. Uh, let's, let's just try it, okay? Um, I'll play something and you guys just sing whatever comes to your mind. Stephen, we'll start with you. We've never done that before. That's okay. Um, just let it flow. Stephen, we'll start with you. I got nothing, dude.

She said she would email you guys and reach out to you and you know, you guys could tell her how you're feeling. Give her some time. We're out of time.

No, I don't want to fucking hug! I don't want a hug. I don't want you to tell me it's going to be okay. I'm sick of all of you just saying it's gonna be okay, because it's not! You need to fix this right now, because I can't see my friends. My, my uncle's going out every night and his life continues? It's okay, but ours has to stop right now? I'm done with it, I need my friends, they need me, so we can just share what's going on. I'm here, I'm listening. Of course. I know, I know you are, I- I appreciate it. It's just not the same. There are things we say to each other that we would never say to you. There's a whole other world. Our world. That we don't share, because it's ours. When you take away my friends, it's the end of our world. It's not okay, it's not. I'm - I'm sorry. It's absolutely fine. You sure? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Yeah, it's going to be great. So Nate wants a little help with something. Yeah, Mary said you need help with the song. - Mm hmm. - Okay, I'll leave you to it. Go ahead and have a seat, Nate. So you want to work on a project? Yeah, I wrote a, a song for Amy. I thought it would be cool. She's sick, you know. Amy's going to be okay, Nate. But I, I think writing a song is a great idea. What do you want it to say? That I really like her. I think she knows that. Yeah, I think so, too. So what else do you want it to say? I wish I could help her and her mom and I know it sounds stupid, but they save them, you know? I wrote the song and played it for her and she really liked it. I played it over and over. Sounds like it could be a duet. Yeah, that's what I thought. I miss her so much. There's so many things I want to say, but... so hard to talk to her when she's around. How about you guys do this as a duet for the showcase? Yeah, but we can't record anything because we're all stuck at home. I'll record it. You just write down what you're feeling, but I'll put it up tonight. - Sounds good? - Yeah. All right, let's practice this. What do you, what do you want to say?

Yeah, a few of the kids came to see me. But I didn't invite them there. How did they know you were going to be there? I was performing with this band, Fantazm. Uh, it kind of sounds like you're trying to like, accuse me of something. Gary's mother sent this to us. What is this? It's a note from Gary. He attempted suicide last night.

It's so fucked up that this is what it took to get us all back together. Not anymore. Yeah, fuck this quarantine shit. We need each other. Yeah. Looks like he needs a hug. Let's go give him one Door's locked. Brielle, what are you doing? Crazy, huh. Am I in heaven or is Brielle in my bed? You wish. Everyone here? Okay, so I understand it's been a really tough past couple of months, not to mention a really tough past couple of days. And I just want to make sure that you kids do not lose sight of this performance that's coming up. You have worked way too hard and way too long, and you are far too talented to get distracted. And I know that it's going to be amazing. It won't be the same without him. I know. And I don't think there's anything I can do to get him back. No, nothing. I can't find anything on him online at all. He doesn't have any shows listed. I know, okay, I'll call you if I find anything. I don't know, Gary. Brielle can't find him, and we went to his house and he's not there. We'll figure it out, okay? All right, bro. I'll talk to you later. Mr. Lars? Mr. Lars, is that you? - Hey, Nate. - Oh, my God. Mr. Lars, we've been looking for you everywhere, are you okay? I'm, I'm not okay.

Something has to change. Our friend almost died, Mary. You can't just lock us away anymore. We need each other. At some point, we all have a decision to make. In light of recent events and after a lot of careful consideration, we have decided it's time to bring all of our kids back to school.
