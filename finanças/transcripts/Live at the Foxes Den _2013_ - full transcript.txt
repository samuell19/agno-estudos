YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR ME, ELIZABETH. - You know how my father feels about you. You're like a son to him. - ELIZABETH, STOP. - Hey, then, who are you? Some drunk in a bar?

HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THOSE SONGS? - YOU KNOW, NOT THAT I'M EVER CURIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING, BUT SINCE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT... HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE SONGS? - I USED TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE A LOT. I WOULD SIT IN THE DEN WITH MY GRANDFATHER AND LISTEN TO HIS OLD HI-FI. I NEVER WANTED TO GO HOME. - SING TO ME, BOBBY, LIKE YOU DID THAT FIRST NIGHT YOU CAME IN WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND. -SHE'S NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND. - LOTS OF PEOPLE COME IN DRUNK, TRY TO SING. NOBODY PAYS ANY ATTENTION. BUT WHEN YOU SANG, I THOUGHT, "THIS GUY'S GOT"... - ISSUES. - STOP! I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.

I KNOW I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM. - YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG, OKAY? HE'S GOT A PROBLEM. -I JUST WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY. -CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? -YEAH, OF COURSE. - THE OTHER DAY, I TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM. HE PRETENDED HE DIDN'T HEAR ME. WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE WE WERE... WELL, HE HEARD ME. -YEAH, I WANT TO HELP HIM OUT. ARE HE AND HIS BROTHER, SPENCER, CLOSE? -HIS BROTHER'S DEAD. I THINK HE KILLED HIMSELF. -I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. -CHAD NEVER TALKS ABOUT IT. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND HIM. HE'S GOT THIS TATTOO. -CHAD HAS A TATTOO. -IT SAYS "PAMELA." WHO'S PAMELA? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I'M TIRED. I WANT TO GO HOME. -BOBBY, COME QUICK! HELLO, 911? YEAH, WE NEED PARAMEDICS. -I CAN'T BREATHE. - MOVE YOUR HANDS. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HE SAID HE DIDN'T FEEL WELL. HE JUST STOOD UP AND KEELED OVER. -HE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK. DID SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE? - THEY'RE ON THE WAY. - OH, PAUL. - TONY, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. - Shh. Shh. Shh. DON'T TALK.

I WAS SO PROUD. -I DID IT FOR YOU. NOW, D-DON'T TALK. -NO, YOU DID IT FOR US. - WHEN RACHMANINOFF PREMIERED HIS FIRST SYMPHONY, IT WAS SUCH A TOTAL DISASTER THAT HE HAD A COMPLETE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. HE WALKED AWAY FROM MUSIC, AND HE SAID, "NEVER AGAIN." SO WHAT DID HIS FAMILY DO ABOUT IT? THEY BROUGHT IN TOLSTOY TO CHEER HIM UP. - DID THAT WORK? - HA! DID TOLSTOY EVER CHEER YOU UP? SO THEN THEY SENT HIM TO THIS HYPNOTIST, WHO LAID HIM DOWN ON A COUCH AND WOULD REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HIS EAR, "YOU ARE A GREAT COMPOSER. YOU WILL WRITE MORE MUSIC." DID THAT WORK? -HE WALKED OUT OF HIS OFFICE AND SAT DOWN AND WROTE HIS SECOND PIANO CONCERTO. - HAVE YOU STUDIED MUSIC YOUR WHOLE LIFE? -UP TO A POINT. I WENT TO JUILLIARD FOR ABOUT 12 MINUTES. NOT MY KIND OF PLACE. YOU? - NO, I NEVER STUDIED MUSIC. - SERIOUSLY? - DID YOU JUST LOOK IMPRESSED? - YEAH, FAT CHANCE. IT TAKES A LOT MORE TO IMPRESS ME THAN SOME BAR-EXAM-FLUNKING CROONER. - NO, I PASSED THE BAR EXAM ON THE FIRST TRY. I WAS LAW REVIEW. WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? I WAS LAW REVIEW. DO YOU KNOW THE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUSTICE FRANKFURTER AND JUSTICE BLACK? -SHOULD I? -YES, YOU SHOULD. IT MAY NOT AFFECT YOU, BUT IT AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE. DO WE LIVE BY ACCIDENT AND DIE BY ACCIDENT, OR DO WE LIVE BY PLAN AND DIE BY PLAN? - I THINK YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE OF THOSE, PAL. - I'M GONNA NEED FOUR CASES OF JACK. YOU KNOW I'M GOOD FOR IT. - HERE'S YOUR ORANGE JUICE. BOTTOMS UP. -TRUST ME. THIS IS GONNA BE BIG. -CHAD, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT TIME IS IT? -TIME FOR YOUR O.J. -O.J. TIME. - HEY, BOBBY, HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR LAST NAME? -UH, KELLY. -OH. -WHY? -FOR THE POSTER! I'M PLANNING A BIG NIGHT. THEY'RE GONNA BE FLOCKING IN HERE TO SEE YOU. -BIG NIGHT? BARROWS, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? - DON'T LOOK AT ME. NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING. - YOU. SING WITH ME. - YOU REALLY THINK I COULD? -YES! EARL, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER NAME ON THAT POSTER. -TONY? -HE'S GONE. -HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S SLEEPING. -HE LOOKS SO PEACEFUL. SERIOUSLY. HE NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD. -MAYBE HE'S A LATE BLOOMER. - YOU COULDN'T GET ANY LATER THAN THIS. KAT. KAT. COME ON. KAT. COME ON. -IT'S OKAY, HONEY. HE HAD A GOOD LIFE. -BOBBY. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR PAUL, AND FOR ME. -WHAT DID I DO? -WELL, THE OTHER NIGHT, WHEN YOU GOT PAULIE UP AND DANCING, GOD, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. AND WHEN HE SANG WITH YOU, THE LOOK ON HIS FACE... THANK YOU FOR THAT LOOK. THANK YOU. - MAYBE, UH, SOMEONE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING. - "BUT NOW MY TASK IS SMOOTHLY DONE. I CAN FLY, OR I CAN RUN." JOHN MILTON. -FOXES DEN. NO. ANTHONY O'HARA? NO. NOT HERE. -PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS? -HMM? OH, SORRY, KAT. WHAT? -YOU ARE A MILLION MILES AWAY. NOW I'M HERE. - HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH CHAD? - I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING'S JUST BEEN BUGGING HIM. -SING FOR ME? -SURE. YEAH. EARL, DOESN'T THIS PLACE HAVE A SINGER? -YEAH, ON PAYROLL. TONY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR? LET'S DO IT, CHAD. COME ON. PLAY SOMETHING. I BET YOU I KNOW IT. -PLAY A LOVE SONG. -GET LOST. -HEY. HEY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? THAT GIRL LOVES YOU. YOU KNOW THAT? YOU EVER CONSIDER THAT PEOPLE HAVE FEELINGS? -PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FEELINGS. THEY HAVE DESIRES. EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU FEEL IS JUST SOMETHING YOU WANT. - WHAT ARE YOU BOYS TALKING ABOUT? -YOU, ACTUALLY. I WAS JUST SAYING WHAT A GREAT COUPLE YOU GUYS MAKE. "CHAD AND KAT" REALLY HAS A RING TO IT, HUH? -ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S SOFIA... BUT WITH AN "F," RIGHT? -WHAT'S THE MATTER? HEY, WHAT'S... WHO IS SOFIA? -BOBBY KELLY, MEET SOFIA TAYLOR. -SOFIA TAYLOR? THIS YOU? -SO, EARL, THAT'S TAYLOR... T-A-Y-L-O-R. FOR THE POSTER. -KAT. KAT! TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM A GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE. I WAS PARTYING ALL DAY, AND THIS CAR CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT... I CRASHED INTO HIM. I GOT OUT. I WENT AND LOOKED AT HIS CAR. HE WAS... STILL SITTING BEHIND THE WHEEL. I... PANICKED. -WHAT DID YOU DO? -I RAN AWAY. -WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? -OVER A YEAR AGO. -A YEAR? WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? HAVE YOU... HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THEM? -NO. NO. -KAT... WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I'M A LAWYER. I... HOW LONG DID YOU THINK YOU COULD KEEP THIS UP? -BOBBY, I'M NOT A BAD PERSON. PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME. -I'M NOT MAD. BUT THIS IS OVER. IT'S RINGING. -Hello? Hello? -MAMA. -Sofia? Sofia, is that you? -IT'S ME. MAMA, I'M SORRY. -Where are you? - I'M SORRY. - Are you okay? I WANT TO COME HOME. -WHAT DO I DO? - I DON'T KNOW, BOBBY. IT'S A TOUGH CALL. I MEAN, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, ONLY WHAT SHE'S TOLD YOU, RIGHT? AND IT HAPPENED OUT OF STATE. - WELL, I GOT TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER. YOU KNOW, I NEED TO HELP HER. - WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS GIRL BEING YOUR CLIENT? BOBBY, YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT'S REALLY IN HER BEST INTEREST. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CRIMINAL EXPERIENCE, NOR HAVE YOU BEEN INSIDE A COURTROOM IN YOUR LIFE. -YEAH, KEEP BUILDING ME UP. - I'M NOT TRYING TO BE MAUDLIN OR SENTIMENTAL HERE, ALL RIGHT? BUT YOU'RE ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS I'VE EVER MET, BUT YOU HAVE NEVER REPRESENTED A CLIENT AT A TRIAL. ALL RIGHT, I HOPE SOMEDAY THAT YOU DO, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, AS YOUR FRIEND, YOU GOT TO LET THIS ONE GO. -I CAN'T LET IT GO. FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, YOU'RE CONSULTING ONE OF THE SHARPEST LEGAL MINDS IN THE STATE. THAT WAS YOUR FIRST GOOD MOVE. - OKAY, YOU'VE COME TO A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY, ALL RIGHT? IF YOUR FRIEND MAKES IT HOME... - YEAH. -...HAVE HER CALL THAT NUMBER. -THE FOXES DEN. NO, HE'S NOT HERE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?! HE'S NOT HERE! THEY JUST CALLED FOR YOU AGAIN. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?! -WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHO? - THE EXECUTIONERS OF PAUL'S ESTATE. -YOU... YOU MEAN EXECUTORS. -NO, I MEAN EXECUTIONERS. I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU WITH THIS. -NO, TONY, TELL ME. PAUL LEFT HIS VETERANS BENEFITS TO ME, BUT THE V.A. WON'T RECOGNIZE ME AS A LEGITIMATE... I DON'T KNOW. THE LAWYERS SAY I'LL JUST SPEND THE MONEY FIGHTING FOR MY BENEFITS. THEY'RE SAYING THEY'LL GIVE ME 7,500 BUCKS. ALL'S I GOT TO DO IS SIGN A WAIVER. IT'S WHY THEY KEEP CALLING. I CAN'T FIGHT ANYMORE. -EARL, I... -YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. - WHERE'S CHAD? WHY ISN'T HE HERE? - IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE SAID OUR GOODBYES. BOBBY, LISTEN. -AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME, I WANT YOU TO CALL THIS GUY. HE'S EXPECTING YOUR CALL. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, KAT. I MEAN... SOFIA. -KAT. REMEMBER ME AS KAT. - TONY, YOU'RE NOT SIGNING ANYTHING. EARL, DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBER FOR THOSE VULTURES? -YEAH. - Hello. Alan Lewis. - YES, HELLO. I'M CALLING REGARDING ANTHONY O'HARA. - Oh, yes. Well, as we explained to Mr. O'Hara, he is... -STOP TALKING AND LISTEN TO ME. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION COMPLETELY RECOGNIZES MR. O'HARA, AND YOU WILL NOT CONTACT HIM AGAIN UNTIL YOU HEAR FURTHER FROM ME IN WRITING. - And you are? - ROBERT KELLY. I'M MR. O'HARA'S LAWYER. CHAD? CHAD? DOOR WAS OPEN. I JUST... I LET MYSELF IN. -OH, GOOD FOR YOU. MOST PEOPLE NEVER BELIEVE THE DOOR IS OPEN. -KAT'S GONE. -YES. -SO HOW ARE YOU? -WELL... WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT I'M... I'M GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY GET UP AND GET MY OWN DRINKS FROM NOW ON... I'D SAY I'M FAIR TO MIDDLIN'. DO PEOPLE SAY THAT ANYMORE? "FAIR TO MIDDLIN'"? MY MOTHER SAID THAT ALL THE TIME. -WERE YOU GUYS CLOSE? -MY MOTHER AND I? - WHY DID YOUR BROTHER KILL HIMSELF? -WHY? WE'RE JUST THAT KIND OF FAMILY. - SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER RELATIVES. -IT'S JUST ME... AND REMINGTON, HANNIGAN, AND TATE. - WHO'S REMINGTON, HANNIGAN, AND TATE? -THEY'RE THE OLD FIRM THAT HANDLES MY FAMILY'S AFFAIRS. - YOU KNOW, TONY... HE'S LOST WITHOUT PAUL. YOU KNOW PAUL'S FATHER WAS ERROL FLYNN? - PAUL'S FATHER WAS NOT ERROL FLYNN. PAUL'S FATHER WAS SOME INSURANCE SALESMAN. - PAUL TOLD ME HIS FATHER WAS ERROL FLYNN. -YEAH, THAT'S JUST HIS STORY. EVERYONE'S GOT A STORY. -SO WHO'S PAMELA? CHAD? WHO'S PAMELA, CHAD? -SHE WAS MY WIFE. -YOUR WIFE? YOU'RE DIVORCED? -NO, SHE DIED. -I'M SORRY. UH, HOW DID... -SHE JUST GOT SICK... AND DIED. WHEN YOU'RE STANDING THERE AND SHE'S LYING IN A CASKET... AND SHE'S ONLY 25, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU CAN'T BE... -YOU REALLY LOVED HER. -I CAN'T REMEMBER. - I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. -YOU KNOW... I'VE NEVER MET A LAWYER WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY BEFORE. IT'S AN HONOR TO KNOW YOU. WELL, THERE'S ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ASK. THE DRINKING... IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM. NO, NOT SEEMS TO BE. IT I A PROBLEM. I LOOKED INTO IT, AND THERE'S A GROUP THAT MEETS EVERY WEEK AT A CHURCH NEAR THE DEN. UH, THERE'S A MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT AT 7:30, AND IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME IF YOU GO... WITH ME. -SURE, PAL. SURE. YEAH. - SO WE'RE DECIDING IF FIDUCIARY OR CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP HAS A FORM OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE IN LINE 12. COME IN. -EXCUSE ME. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALONE. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. THESE ARE MY NEW ASSOCIATES. EVERYONE, THIS IS BOBBY KELLY. - I CAN COME BACK. - NO, BOBBY. IN FACT, WE WERE JUST WORKING ON WATKINS HERE, REVIEWING THE PRIVILEGED DOCS. IT TOOK US THREE MONTHS, BUT WE FINALLY GOT THEM BACK. - DID THEY FILE A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT? -YES, THEY DID, BUT WE GOT THEM. - KENNETH, I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE. IT WAS WRONG THE WAY I LEFT THAT DAY. -I UNDERSTAND. YOU WERE UPSET. LAW IS NOT FOR THE FAINT FOR HEART. -YOU'RE RIGHT. LAW ISN'T FOR THE FAINT OF HEART, NOR IS IT FOR THE PRIVILEGED FEW. -AND YET HERE YOU ARE, BACK. -NO. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HIRED ME, SO I FELT I SHOULD TELL YOU FIRST. I'M GOING TO OPEN MY OWN PRACTICE. -YOUR OWN FIRM. -YES. -THAT IS NO JOKE. YOU REALIZE YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN YOU'VE EVER WORKED IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. AND YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE TO SET YOUR CROONING CAREER ON HOLD FOR A WHILE. -I KNOW. -I'M FIRST CHAIRING THE GRANDVILLE DEPOSITION TOMORROW MORNING, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE ANY OF THEIR NONSENSE. -SUSAN. -BOBBY. - WHAT, DID YOU FORGET ABOUT ME ALREADY? -NO, I DIDN'T. I JUST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU WITHOUT RED WINE ON YOUR SHIRT. - PEOPLE, TAKE YOUR SEATS. WE'RE READY. -LET'S DO IT, PAL. -HELLO. MY NAME IS LARRY.
