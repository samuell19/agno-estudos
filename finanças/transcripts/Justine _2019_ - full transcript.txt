- Hi, I have a placement interview at 1:00, Lisa Wade. - Okay, Ms. Wade. It looks like we have all your paperwork, so we'll be with you in a few minutes. - Okay. - Is this your first interview? - Yeah. - Cool. They're actually pretty good, I got a job with them before. - Really? - Hmm mm. - What was the job? - It was an insurance company, and the company sold insurance to people. I was an assistant. Yeah. It was really cool because I had my own cubicle and like no one ever walked by, so I could just text and be on my phone all day and no one knew. Yeah, text freedom is very important to me on my next job. [phone rings] And I would have left, honestly, but like this woman- - [Secretary] Lisa, she's ready for you now. - Great. - It says here that you have office experience, computer skills, you've worked in customer service. - Yes. - Have you ever worked in a medical office, done any medical billing, insurance billing? - No, but I'm a very quick learner, I'm sure I could pick something like that up very quickly. - Oh yeah, now these offices tend to want a trained medical office assistant. So we've just checked that off the list and we can't say that you have a college degree because you've only completed two years of college, is that correct? - Correct. - Okay, we'll see what we get with this. You know the only problem is, there are only so many receptionist It would be really helpful if we can open up your horizons a bit. Have you considered working in the care fields? - Like daycare or something? - Daycare, elderly home care, nanny. - Yeah no, I don't really think that's me, I'm not very caretaker-ish. - You wrote here that you have two children. Okay. It's just, there's really not a lot out there right now and if you wanna get a job quick, you can't afford to be too picky. All I'm saying is, sometimes we need to allow ourselves to surprise ourselves. - I just prefer to work in an office. - Okay, we'll see what we get. [soft music] - Are you gonna take us to school everyday Papa Don? - No, for a while. - Hey mama, did you get a job? - No, not yet. - Hi mom. - Can't believe you still drive this piece of shit car. - You wanna talk about my car and you don't even got a car? - Because I sold it so I can have money to take care of my kids. - Oh, is that what you did? - Hey guys, I'm gonna sing in the talent show at my school. - Ooh. - What are you gonna sing? - I think I'm gonna sing one of the country songs, I just have to pick which one. - Who got on this country western kick, huh? - You should probably sing a Taylor Swift song. - No, I don't want to 'cause this sixth grader is already singing one. - [Don] I tell you what, I'm gonna work in my garden, does anybody wanna help out? [kids shouting] - Hello? - Get out of school clothes. - Yes, this is Lisa Wade. Yeah, my message was inquiring about any updates on the investigation. So why did you even bother calling me back? If you have no new information, then what's the fucking point of even calling me? Call me when you can tell me what happened. Oh, no, I'm fine. Great, I'll just wait to hear from you then. [knocking on the door] Come in. - Is that them? - Nothing new Don. - Hey, we gonna do a little work in the garden, you wanna help? - Does that sound like something I'd wanna help you do? - No. - Hey, can you watch them the rest of the day? I think I'm just gonna go up to some of those stores up the road and apply. - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Lisa, why don't you go checkout your benefits? - 'Cause I don't want their benefits. - Okay. [soft music] [loud hip hop music] - [Lady] Hi, can I help you? - Yeah, I was wondering if you guys are hiring. - No, we're not. - Okay. - [Lady] There's a big store around the corner that always has a hiring sign out front. You could try there. - Thanks. [upbeat music] - Welcome to super locks. Welcome to super locks, super low prices. Let me tell you about some sales to look out for once you get inside, we got markdowns on everything from pool accessories to Tampax, all our summer stuff, it's 50% off- - I was actually wondering if you guys are hiring. - [Salesman] Oh, I can't answer that for you, but I can tell you that we've got some great deals in our beauty section, all our Clayton products are on sale. In case you wanna freshen up that color. [soft music] ♪ They doubted you and planned that you choose ♪ ♪ And so the answer that you gave them is I'm an American ♪ - Maya stop singing, eat your dinner. - Papa Don, how do know how to cook so many things? And why you wear gloves? - Are you kidding? I'm a professional. That was my job in the Navy. Yeah, I was in charge of every meal, head cook for over 1000 men for four years. And then I was in charge of every meal for about 200 men for 10 years. - Is that way he wear earrings and tattoos, Papa Don? Because you were a sailor? - Oh, that's pirates, Maya. - Well, every man of the sea should wear tattoos and earrings. - [Drew] Okay. - What's the matter, you don't like my food? - No, I just wasn't that hungry. - It's not polite to leave the table while others are eating. Don't fill that out, all here tomorrow. - Hey, Papa Don. - What? - I won't be able to eat mine tomorrow. - Yeah, why is that? - You'll eat mine tomorrow. - Look at you, Maya. Oh, that's too much, don't, don't. [laughs] Oh, alright, oh you really like my cooking? [mumbles] [laughs] Stop that, don't talk with your mouth full. [laughs] [soft music] - Thank you. [soft music] [phone rings] Hello? Oh yeah, hi Pat. No, remember I said I'm not interested in a care position, I'll be a receptionist or an assistant or... It's just one kid? Where do they live? Nothing else has come up in the last two weeks? They have a car for me to drive like, to and from work too? Okay, yeah. I'll go meet them. - So Lisa, you recently moved to California? - Yes. - What brought you here? - Needed to find work. - Do you have family here? - My kid's grandfather lives here, he grew up out here. - Your kid's grandfather, but that's not your father? Oh, okay. Well then let us tell you a little bit about us. - I'm good, right? We met, I can go? - Sorry Lisa, Michael, he had a commitment today. So he just wanted to meet you, but he has to run. - Great to meet you, maybe I'll see you on the house? - Yeah. Nice to meet you. - Sorry about that, God forbid you mess with a man's schedule. Okay, so where were we? Oh, about us, my husband and I both work with Justine and all of her needs and surgeries, we just really need the two incomes. I'm a Realtor and my husband's a home builder, he developed this whole neighborhood. We worked together, he builds them and I sell them. - You said Justine has needs and surgeries? - So, Justine has spina bifida and has almost complete paralysis in her legs. She has no bowel control on our own so I'll have to show you the routine on that. Obviously she needs help getting dressed and getting in and out of her chair but other than that, she's really self-sufficient. She loves to sing to herself, talk to herself. She's a big reader, she's used to being on her own. She's in her room right now, just having a great time, which is really nice. So, why don't I walk you through her daily routine? Give you a little tour of the house. - Okay. - So this is where the two of you will spend the majority of your time. Justine's days are very structured, we find that structure works best for her. When she's woken up and you dress her and feed her breakfast, she will come here and begin her home school lesson for the day. Her teacher Ellen arrives at 9:00 a.m, after Ellen leaves, Justine has lunch and then she has free time until 2:30. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, she can go to the park if the weather permits, Tuesday and Thursday, she can play at home. And then in the evening you will take her through her routine of bath, dinner, reading, bed. It's really pretty simple, do you have any questions? - When Justine is with her teacher, what do I do? - Oh, you can get caught up on any laundry or whatever light cleaning needs to be done, just the household stuff. - Why doesn't she just go to school? - We've just always felt it's better for Justine to be at home under our supervision. She's not like other kids, we know that. We feel it's better for us to create a happy environment for her rather than put her in some big school where God knows what will happen. This way. My husband and I really believe strongly in our house being a sacred space. We'd like you and Justine to only spend time in Justine's designated areas, her den and her bedroom. Oh, and if you do decide to work for us, which I hope you do, we of course, want you to get along with Justine, but we are also wanna make sure that she doesn't become too attached. We like the nannies to keep a little bit of a distance just in case something doesn't work out. With all that Justine's been through, we just feel heartbroken when a nanny decides to quit. - Yeah, that's fine. I'm fine with keeping things more professional. - Great. Let me introduce you to Justine. Justine, I'd like you to meet Lisa, she might be your new nanny. - Hi Justine, it's nice to meet you. - I said go back to your room. That was Jessica, she keeps sneaking up on me. - Justine, she's just playing. She has a lot of imaginary friends. - I know, it's about time she got here. - Justine. The hours are 8:00 a.m to 7:00 p.m. We pay $15 an hour and you will have use of our van, on the weekends the hours are 9:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m and we pay $18 an hour in those days. Look, I know you have kids, so I'm sorry to ask you to work weekends, but those are some of our busiest days with open houses and showings. - No, that's fine. I really need the work, so the extra hours are great. - Fantastic. - Okay. Well thank you, it was nice to meet you. - [Alison] So what do you think? Are you interested in taking the job? - Yeah, I'll take it. - [Alison] Can you start tomorrow? - Yeah. - [Alison] Do you always have to be such an asshole to people? - [Michael] The fuck [mumbles] Shut up and ride my dick. - [Allison] Oh yeah? - [Michael] Yeah. [yells] - Do you wanna read a book with me? How about craft? Yeah, oh you changed your mind? Yeah, okay. Do you wanna go find them scissors or something? Okay. Oh, my show. [upbeat music] - Here you go. - Thanks. [upbeat music] Down to nothing, she pushed through with a... an overgrown branch and stumbled over some roots- - I'm gonna take your dress off. One second. [water drips] Oops, sorry. [tap water dripping] You want your book? - Pushed through an overgrown branch and stumbled over some roots, brawling her out into a clearing. Her flashlight flew out of her hands and landed on the ground. - [TV Reporter] Winning lottery numbers- - [TV Reporter] Caught overnight between rival factions along the Israeli-Syrian border. Initial reports claim Israeli jet fighter were in the guerrilla base- [mumbles] - RPV Homeowners Association. What was it, a ballot measure or something that kept it all in check. Well, they just gotta wait for the next meeting 'cause there's no way, look, yes, yes, yeah right, for that number of parcels, the only way you're gonna make money, hang on, thanks. Thank you, tomorrow, right? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay. - Safe drive. - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah. Right, well because it was $250,000, that's why. - And what are you doing, washing? - Yeah. - And what did they call? - The bones. - That's right. [laughs] Now pick, seven a piece. - One, tow, three, four, five, six, seven. - Six, seven. - All right, set them on the edge. - Now what do we do? - Set them on the edge like this so you can read it so that sort of... That's a face in you so that you can see them. - Oh, hi mom. - Hi. - Hey. - [Don] Hey, you wanna eat? - No thanks, I'm not that hungry. - [Don] I'll fix you a plate. - I said I'm not hungry. - Wait mom, do you wanna play game with us? We could start a new round. - Yeah. - No thanks. - Okay. - And the next one. No, that's not right, try again. [soft music] Okay, now this one. Write neater, remember? Okay better, try this one. [soft music] - [Jasmine] Could this place really be haunted? Celine pointed her flashlight toward the stairs, the cobwebs and dust glimmered in the light, the store Clark said it had been years since- - [Allison] Where's my little reader? - [Jasmine] Mom. - Hi Lisa. Hi, I missed you. - I missed you too. - Oh, was your day good? - [Jasmine] Yes, it was. - [Allison] Good, good. Lisa, we're good here, thank you so much. - Okay. - [Allison] So tell me, what did you do? - I finished book two. - You finished book two. ♪ Babe you know I'm liking your style ♪ ♪ Why do this every night, every night ♪ ♪ Only thing in my mind is you and the moon ♪ - Wait, Papa Done you just passed the IHop, that's where we were supposed to turn. - We're not going home just yet. - Where are we going? - Well, you know how your mom's got this new job? - Yeah. - [Maya] Yeah. - It's kinda like a secret place she gets to go. - Yeah. - Well, we're gonna go to a secret place of our own. - What is it? - Oh, it's a place where you get to go if you were in the military or if you have family who were in the military. So it's a very special place that you get to go to, for special people like us. - Mom doesn't really like to talk about military stuff, she probably won't want us to go there. - Yeah, she isn't even wanna say, you know whose name? - Who? - D-A-D. - Yeah, that's why it's a secret. Look, I tell you what you guys, you keep this secret with me, who knows? You might want me to keep a secret for you sometime, okay? Mom doesn't have to know every damn thing we do when she's not here. - Well, it's true. [office phone rings] [speaks in foreign language] - What can I do for you? - You guys got a counselor I can talk to? - Yes, but you have to make an appointment in advance. - Shit. - Did you have one? - No, no, I didn't have one. Can I make one now? - Sure, but it's not gonna be until later on this week. - Later on this week? - [Man] Yeah. - All right, like Thursday, Friday? - [Man] Little down this week. - Let's do that.

Do you feel this hard dick? Oh, yeah, let's introduce everyone. Okay, I would like some tea please. Okay. Whoa, it needs a little, honey. [soft music] - Do you mind if we play with your toys? - [Justine] Sure, I love to share. - [Girl] What's wrong with you? - I can't walk, I was born like this. I have spinal bifida. - Is that like being retarded or something? [laughs] - What? No. - Yeah, 'cause your glasses are weird. They're not like normal glasses, they make your eyes look different. Can you even see if I take them off? Whoa, these are so weird. - What do you think you're doing? No, you're not going anywhere. Do you think it's okay to talk to people like that? Do you? Is that your mom over there? Go tell your mom she's raising some little bitches. Go! Hey Justine, are you okay? All right, let's pack up. All right, ready? One, two, three. - [Justine] You go tell your mom she's raising some little bitches, you go tell your mom she's raising some little bitches, you go tell your mom- - Okay, Justine stop saying that. Look, I said that to those girls because I didn't like the way they were talking to you, but you shouldn't use that word. - Mom called you that. - Called me what? - A bitch, she said, "she seemed like a bitch, but as long as she shows up on time, I don't mind." - She said that to you? - No, to dad, but I was listening. - Justine, why do you talk to yourself all the time? - Oh, well sometimes I don't talk to myself, sometimes I sing or say books that I've read or say plays that I've seen. - Okay, well, why do you do it? - Mom and dad tell me, "Justine, singing and talking to yourself is a great way to entertain yourself. That way, if no one can talk to you, you can just talk to yourself." Mom said that people don't wanna be bothered by me talking to them all the time, that's why I have all my imaginary friends. They like, when I talk to them. - You can talk to me. - Really? - Yeah, I mean I'm here all the time so we might as well talk to each other, right? - Yeah. - And we're right down here on the left side. - All right, can we all do this? - Sir, I already told you I can only speak with you today. - Okay. Well, is there some place that they can do their homework? - Yes, right around the corner, right there. - In here? - Hmm mmm. - Okay, kids go in there, do your homework. - Yeah. - I'll be here in a minute, yeah? - [Maya] Okay. - Come on in. - Yeah you know, I came so that they can talk to you, you know that? - Oh, I understand that sir, but technically I can't speak with children without their parent's permission. - Well, what does that mean? Technically? I mean, the way you said that makes me think that there's some nontechnical way that you could talk with my grand kids and make sure that they're- - No sir, that's not what I meant. - All right well, how about this? How about we talk, me and you a little bit and then I introduce you to my grand kids and then you just meet them and talk with them and find out if there's anything funny with them. - I don't think I'd be able to tell if someone was suffering from a grief disorder or depression just by meeting them. - You meet Lisa, you know there was something wrong with her. - That's their mother. - Yes, ma'am. - And her husband was killed? - Yes ma'am. - Your son? What's going on with Lisa? - Girl's like a robot. I'm telling you she doesn't talk to anybody, none of us. Now she's got some job where she's gone every day of the week and those are her kids. I do everything for them, that's fine. But she's their mom. - What was Lisa like immediately after his death? - Oh, well she was the same in her own world, she didn't talk to anybody at the funeral. Oh, she didn't even cry. She almost wasn't even gonna come to the funeral, talking about, she didn't feel like he was there so why should she play their games? Whatever the hell that meant. I'm the one who got her to come. - [Counselor] Their games? - Oh, she's not real happy with the military, on the account of how long they took to get the body back to us, took three weeks. Of course, they had the autopsy and investigation. I've known Lisa for a long time, she and Johnny were best friends since they were kids. Lisa has always been a tough nut to crack I'm telling you, but the way she's acting now. - The thing about your daughter-in-law, her behavior is actually not that unusual. It really isn't. It sounds to me like Lisa is still in the thick of coming to terms with her new reality and she's gonna be there until she's not. - What does that mean? That she's gonna be there until she's not? What does that mean? - It means as long as she's not hurting her children or hurting herself, you need to let her be whoever she is right now. - So that means that I'm... what you're supposed to do nothing? Act like this is normal? - Let's think of it this way, put six months on it and if she's exactly the same person in six months as she is today, we can come up with a new plan. And in the meantime, you keep coming here and giving me updates on what's happening and I can meet your grand kids. - Yes ma'am, yes ma'am. Thank you Ms. Hughes. Yeah we can do that. - Thank you. - Lisa I don't think I wanna go to the park today. - Why do you say that? - Just not in the mood, I guess. - Really? - I just don't wanna see the little bitches. - I'm sorry Justine but you have to go to the park today. You have to let those little bitches know that they can't bother Justine. You can't just let people tell you how you're supposed to live your life. If you don't show up at the park today, they're gonna think they won, like you're scared of them or something. You have to keep being Justine. You know? And what does Justine do? She goes to the park Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Exactly. Today's Friday, so we're going to the park. - Will you play with me? - Yeah, I'll play with you. And if we see the little bitches, we'll say hello. Okay? - Okay. Oh, I see them. - Okay. - I see them. - Okay. - You can do it Justine. Hi. - [Both Girls] Hi. [soft music] [laughs] - You did it! - I can't believe I did it. [soft music] - Hey you did it. - Just feel like, very good! I did it. - Hey, let's go get ice cream cones to celebrate our victory over the little bitches. - But don't we need to eat dinner soon? - Yeah, but who cares? It's a special occasion. - Okay. But we can not tell mom and dad. - Duh? - And also Lisa, let's not tell mom and dad that we're friends now, okay? - Okay. What flavor are you gonna get? - I think I'm going to get the one day is the most colorful. - Okay. - And Jessica wants cookies extremes. - Oh, your imaginary friend, Jessica? [soft music] Yeah, hi. I'm calling to talk to my CAO, Captain Shellman. Alright, well, can you tell me if there's been any progress in the investigation? Yeah, I already know that it's an open investigation. When is Shellman gonna be available? Okay, can you leave a message for him, for me? You can write, it's been almost four months, what are they still investigating? You fucking fuck, thank you. [knocks door] Why even bother knocking if you're just gonna come in? - Yeah look, I know you've gotta work tomorrow, but you're gonna have to take the kids with you in the morning. - What? You told me that you would watch them while I'm at work? - Yeah well I know, but I've got my church group meeting tomorrow. So do you take them with you in the morning? - So? Why don't you just take them with you? They'll wait for you when you're in your group or whatever. - No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna have them waiting in an empty church. No, you just take them with you in the morning and then I'll pick them up at noon, they can come with me to softball, okay? - This is such bullshit. - You're telling me? - Is she's gonna come in? - Kids wanna know if you're gonna come in and listen to Maya's new song. - It's a song about a mom and her daughter, mom. I just learned the entire thing, the son's name is "Fancy" and Reba McEntire sings it, she's like a really famous country singer. Wanna hear it? - I don't know. - Maya go on inside, we'll be in a little while, you go get ready, okay? Actually, I think it's a song about a prostitute, but she doesn't know that and I figured there's no need in introducing that subject. You gonna come in? - I don't know Don, just give me a minute, all right? - Oh, come on in, crying out loud! - Would you shut my fucking door? - She's not gonna come, give it. - You guys calm down, calm down. - [Maya] Give it to me. - [Drew] I just want it. - [Maya] Too bad. - [Drew] I just want it though. - [Maya] Who care what you want? - [Drew] But it's mine! - Hey. - [Maya] No, it's not, let go. - Hey, you guys, come on over here. [grants] - Fine. - Come on. You guys need to hear the music that changed the world. - [Maya] What's that Papa Don? - This is how we used to listen to music.

You know what they used to call her? - [Drew] What? - What? - Lady Day, yeah. She was a sad lady, can you hear it? ♪ I've ever seen - How can you hear someone sad? - That's a good question. You just feel it, I guess. [soft jazz music] - [Drew] Maya, can you help me? - [Maya] Try to do it yourself first. - Where are you going? We have to go. - I'm getting my stuff. - Mom, can you help me? - Yeah. All right, straighten your foot. Alright listen, when we get there, don't talk to Justine. Wait until the parents leave. - [Maya] Why? - Because the parents are weird and they don't like when we talk a lot, I guess. - That's strange. - And I told you Justine's in a wheelchair, right? - [Drew And Maya] Yeah. - But she's not any different than you guys so don't treat her like, something is wrong with her. - Okay. - Okay. - And their house is really nice but don't say anything when you first see it, like don't say, "whoa, this is so cool." Just act like you've been in a house like that before and it's no big deal. Papa Don's gonna come get you in a couple hours- - Mom, stop telling us what to do, it's going to be fine. - Excuse me. ♪ My man don't love me ♪ He treats me oh so mean - What the hell are you singing? - It's a song. ♪ My man don't love me ♪ He treats me - Oh! - Mrs. Green, these are my kids Maya and Drew. Sorry I didn't have anyone to watch them today so I had to bring them. - Oh, that's fine, it's nice to meet you both. - [Drew and Maya] Nice to meet you Mrs. Green. - Oh, hello? - [Allison] Michael, these are Lisa's kids. - Hi. I gotta get to work. - Actually, I'm running out the door as well, busy Saturday. And Justine's in her den playing. - Okay, we'll talk later. - It's okay. - Bye. - So where's the girl? - She's in here. - Hey Justine, these are my kids Maya and Drew. - Hi Justine. - Hi Justine. - Jessica leave, I have company and I don't want you around. - Justine, I don't think that's very nice to talk to Jessica like that, I think she's been a pretty good friend to you. Just 'cause you have company, you don't need to be rude to her. - I was just teasing Jessica, Lisa. I wasn't being mean to her. - Are you sure? - Yeah, see Jessica, I was just teasing you, you can come back. She's coming back. - So what types of things do you like to play? - I like to play with dolls and I liked to sing songs and listen to music and watch things on my iPad and read books. - My sister likes to sing songs. - Yeah, there's gonna be a talent show at school and I'm gonna sing in it. - Like "The Voice?" - Well, it's not exactly like "The Voice", 'cause it's like at my school and stuff, but it is kind of like "The Voice" 'cause it's a singing competition. - Oh, okay. So what are you gonna sing? - Well, lately I've been thinking I would sing a Steven Rice song, he's a country singer. - Okay, why don't we watch TV or something you guys? - Wanna sing it now? - Okay. - Here we go. ♪ Baby you know I'm liking your style ♪ ♪ Why you keep me waiting that sad ♪ ♪ Baby you know I'm liking your style ♪ ♪ Why do this every night, every night ♪ - [Lisa] Okay, you're not singing that song, you're nine. - [Lisa] Mom, stop. - You're not singing babe I'm liking your style. If you wanna sing in your school talent show, you need to sing a song that's appropriate. - What does that mean, appropriate? - You say bad words all the time. - Excuse me. - I said, you say bad words all the time, that's not very appropriate. - It's not about saying bad words Maya, it's about you singing an adult song, in an elementary school talent show and watch yourself. - Did you wanna say something Justine? - Yes. Well, I was thinking you should sing something a little faster, something that the audience can get into. On "The Voice," they always say it's important to get the audience into the song. - That's true, they do say that. - Yeah. I can sing one of my favorite songs to you, it's a song that I wrote and I like to sing it when I'm happy. - Okay. - Can you please hand me that? Can you all sit down like you're the audience? ♪ I'm Justine I like to dance ♪ I dance like this, I dance like that ♪ ♪ Raise your hands ♪ ♪ Raise your hands ♪ Raise your hands ♪ Divine, divine ♪ I dance like this, I dance like this, I dance like that ♪ ♪ I'm a girl, I'm Justine ♪ I'm a girl, I'm Justine ♪ Birds, elephant, raspberries are my favorite ♪ ♪ Things [laughs] ♪ I'm Justine, I like to dance ♪ I dance like this, I dance like that ♪ ♪ Raise your hands ♪ Raise your hands ♪ Raise your hands ♪ Divine, divine ♪ I'm a girl, I'm Justine ♪ I'm a girl, I'm Justine ♪ Birds, elephant, raspberries are my favorite ♪ ♪ Things ♪ [audience clapping] [laughs] - You ask her when she comes back. - No, you ask her, she will never say yes to me. - Allison, my daughter's singing in a talent show at her school on November 18th, I was wondering if Justine could come see her, she really wants to come. They had fun playing together last weekend. - The 18th, let's see. Oh, well that's just a couple of days after Justine's surgery, but I think she should be able to go. - Her surgery? - Yeah, her shunt replacement. Sorry, didn't I tell you? She's due to have her shunt replaced, it drains fluid for her, it's right back here. Lisa, relax, she's had it done several times. - Okay, cool. So she can come? - We'll see, I think so. All right, I'm outta here. I'm gonna miss you. Oh shoot, Lisa I keep forgetting to tell you, Ellen has gone for the next two weeks she's sending in a sub starting tomorrow. Anyway, she's supposed to be really great. Okay. Oh and Lisa, can you just set the alarm when you guys leave? Kathy, next door said she saw suspicious looking African-American man in a beat up car cruising around the neighborhood this weekend. I just wanna be extra careful. - Okay. - Okay good, thanks. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye mom. Yes. - So, how are you guys? - Good. - Good. - Let me guess, third grade and second grade? - Yep. - Good. - I'm going to go get a cup of coffee, be right back. Talk to them about Lisa. - Don, you can leave the door. - Do you talk to kids whose dad died? - Sometimes I talk to kids and sometimes I talk to wives whose husbands have died or husbands whose wives have died or moms and dads whose son or daughter has died. Would you like to talk about your dad dying? - We're not allowed to. - Says who? - Our mom. - Was your dad in the military? - Why do you think we're here? This place is only for military people. - You're right, Maya. - He was a marine. - [Hughes] So, can I ask you guys some questions about your mom? - Sure, we can talk about her. - Good. Now, your grandpa says she's been acting a little different lately, have you guys noticed that? - She is just really sad Mrs. Hughes, that's why she acts like that. - She has a job now and she's really happy about that. She's hardly even sad anymore, she might even go back to college like she was before. She was studying to have a career, but she didn't know what she was gonna choose yet. But she's really smart and she got all As. - Good, wow, that's really good. That's great, hey, did Papa Don get lost looking for coffee or what? [laughs] - Maybe. - Let's go and find him. - Okay, my jacket and his jacket. - Okay play it, I'm ready. - Okay. [upbeat music] Oh, okay, so this is Veronica, she's my favorite character. She's pretty, she's tough and she's in charge of everybody. - Okay. Who's that guy? - Oh that, her BFF Rocky. - You watch the show with your mom? - Sometimes, when she's not at work. [upbeat music] Lisa, what's a nigger? - Where'd you hear that word? - Dad said he feels sorry for you because you got yourself knocked up by some deadbeat nigger and alone with two kids. And I don't know what a nigger is. - Okay Justine, you can't ever say that word again. That's a really, really bad word, okay? - Okay. - That's a word that only very racist people use. - What's a racist? Is it bad? - Yeah. It's when you're mean to somebody because they look different than you, your dad's a racist. - Well, I don't wanna be that. - Well, you don't have to be that, but this is why you should be going to a real school so that you can learn about different kinds of people and be with different kinds of people. But don't worry, I'm gonna teach you, okay? I think that it's good that we became friends, because I think you are different from your family just like I'm different from my family. I'm gonna teach you and it makes sense that it's me that's spending all this time with you. - The little bitches are racist, kind of. - Yeah, yeah it's kinda the same thing, they are kinda racist. [soft music] Okay, is this what you were working on last time? - Yeah. - All right, so we'll bring this one so you can- [doorbell rings] I think that's your teacher. Hi I'm Lisa, I'm the nanny. - Hi, I'm Jackie. - Nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. - Hi, I'm Justine. - Hi Justine, I'm gonna be your teacher for the next couple of weeks while miss Ellen is on vacation, is that okay? - You have an accent? [laughs] - I do, I'm from Mexico, I can speak Spanish too. And you know what? Actually, a lot of the kids that I teach, they're learning to speak Spanish. Do you want me to teach you how to count to 10 in Spanish? - Oh yeah. - All right, let's go. So what is this one? - [Justine] Quarter. - [Jackie] Okay. How about this one? - [Justine] Penny. Quarter. - [Jackie] I'm gonna go fast now. - [Justine] Okay, quarter, quarter, quarter, dime, I mean penny. Aw, I missed that. - [Jackie] No, you're fine, you're fine. Now I think you're ready for the real deal. Lisa, you busy? - No, there's not really laundry so I'm just waiting, I guess. - Why don't you come and sit with us? I think it's always easier to learn when you're learning with other people, you can help Justine. - Yeah, come on Lisa. Please. - Yeah. - Okay, okay cool. - So now let's make a little space for Lisa. Shadow cat is right there. - Learning her numbers. - [Jackie] Yeah. So now, we're gonna give her... Okay, so you're gonna keep a few and then you're gonna tell me how much you have. - Okay. - If you have more than Lisa. - I hope I do. - We'll see. - So I guess we'll see you tomorrow then? - I guess so. - Okay, hold on I'm just trying to open the door here. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey, hi. Hello? - [Jackie] Hi. - Who are you? - Oh, she's the new teacher while Ellen's gone. - Jackie. - Oh, that's right, hi Jackie nice to meet you. I'd shake your hand, but as you can see, they're a little full right now. - What happened? - Oh, he tore his ACL and he stepped right through the staircase on a job site, the doctor's gonna try to get him a surgery tomorrow, okay. Don't step on it, be right back. - Okay. - All right, I have to get back to work, I still have a couple of appointments. Now, the doctors gave him pain meds so hopefully he'll just sleep, but, can you check on him later and make sure, to see if he needs anything? - Yeah. - Okay, now they say they all have to be home for a couple of weeks after the surgery and he'll be able to get around on crutches, but he still won't be able to drive. So, I don't know, we'll have to figure something out, but I might need your help with him while you're here. Okay, all right, your daddy's gonna be fine. See you later. [soft music] - Hey, wanna eat our lunch at the park today? - But what about dad? - He's sleeping, we'll be back before he wakes up. - I've never had lunch at the park before. - Okay, I'll pack up. - Okay. [knocks] - Come in. - What the hell are you doing? Lisa, no, come on now, I'm telling you this garage, isn't insulated. It's too damn cold for you to be sleeping out here now. Come on inside and sleep in my bed, I sleep on the couch. - Don, I'll be fine. If it gets too cold, I'll come in and I'll sleep on the couch. - Don't don't bump into them, they burn the hell out of you. See you think that just because you're in California, that it doesn't get cold here, but it's gonna get down in the 30's in the next couple of months. - I'll be fine. [phone rings] - That them? - No, it was a random local number. Probably one of the stores I applied to. - Yeah. Hey Lis, you remember back in Virginia and you and Johnny wanted to make a fire in the backyard and [chuckles] you almost burned all my trees down, you remember that? Huh? Yeah, you remember and Janice, Janice come run out of the house with the water hose and she spraying water on everything, she had everything except the trees. [laughs] You and Johnny didn't know what in the hell to do. He's still my son, Lisa, I should be able to talk about it. - Good night Don. - Good night Lisa. - Ow! Fuck! [soft music] - [Michael] Hello, can I get a little help please? - Were you calling me? - Yeah, I was yelling for a while, you couldn't hear me? I guess I'll just call you up on your cell phone when I need you. Is Justine done with her teacher? - No, Jackie's still here. - A real diverse thing going on here, don't we? - Excuse me. - Well, I mean you have mixed race kids and Justine's new teacher's Mexican, right? Just joking around [chuckles] can you bring Justine here when she's done. - She has to eat lunch when she's done. - [Michael] She can eat lunch in here. - You want me to bring her lunch to your room? - Yup. Actually, can you make me a sandwich too? - Why do you want her in here? We're supposed to go to the park later. - I wanna spend time with my daughter, Jesus. She doesn't have to go to the park today, she can skip a day. Okay? - Okay. - Hey, Tinnie, I wanted to hang out with you. You wanna come up here, eat lunch with me and watch something? - Okay, yeah. - All right. - Here, let me take this. Okay Justine, arms around me. - Oh. - One, two, three. - Come on up, come here, lady. You good? - Yeah. - You comfy? - Yeah. - There you go. - There you go. - All right. That's your sandwich. - Justine, we can still go to the park later if you want, okay? - She doesn't need to go to the park today, we're fine here. - It's okay Lisa, I don't need to go to the park today. I'm gonna watch something with my dad. - Yeah. What should we watch, what do you think? Let's find something you haven't seen. - [Man On TV] Hey Mark, congratulations, I just heard the wonderful news about Talia. - [Man On TV] I only heard about it myself three days ago. [phone rings] - [Man On TV] You mean they're planning a raid? - [Man] No, it won't be a raid, it will be war. - [Man] How soon is this Mr. Scott? - [Man] Any moment. - [Man] Maybe we'll all get to work for it, Bradley. - [Allison] Hey Lisa. - Hi. - Justine's up here. - [Lisa] Oh, okay. [laughs] - [Allison] You guys are- - [Michael] Three, four, five, six, seven [mumbles] - [Justine] Go fish. - All right Lisa, I'm heading off to my open house, Justine's with Michael. - Oh, I have to go get her ready, we're supposed to go to the softball game today. We had it planned. - Well, if she's having fun with her dad, I don't think you have to go. - Well, yeah, we do have to go 'cause I told Justine I'd take her and she's been looking forward to it. My kids are gonna be there and she likes playing with them. - Oh honestly Lisa, you can talk to Michael about it, I need to get going. - Okay. - [Allison] Okay. Yeah hi, I'm running late, five minutes. Can you book a parking space for me. - [Justine] Go fish. - Oh, hello. - Hi Lisa, I'm playing Go fish with dad, you wanna watch? - No, Justine we have to get ready, we're gonna the softball game today. - Oh yeah, the softball game, I almost forgot. - What softball game? - There's a softball game at Jefferson Park, my kids are gonna be there with their grandfather. Jackie's supposed to meet us, we planned it this week. - Jackie, the substitute teacher? - Yeah. Arms to me to me. - Did you even ask permission before you made a plan to take our daughter to some game with a bunch of strangers that we hardly know? - [Lisa] Allison knows about it. - She didn't tell me about it. - Wow. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Well, that's not my problem. - Okay, let's call her. I mean were in the middle of the game do you ever think that maybe I had something that I wanted to do with Justine today? - Like what? You can't do anything right now. Justine wants to play with other kids, she doesn't get to go to school, she should at least be allowed to leave the house. - Bye dad. - Hey, hold on a second. - [Lisa] We'll be back later this afternoon. Aren't you supposed to rest anyway? [soft music] - Good game player. - Ow, look at that. And one, two, three. [soft music] - Okay Justine, we're leaving in five minutes. - [Justine] Okay. [laughs] - How long have you been taking care of her? - A couple months, I guess. - Were you're a nanny before? - No. - No, what did you go to school for? - I didn't really go to college, I just did a couple of years at a community college. - That counts, are you going back? - No. I mean, I have a job that pays well, that's why people go to school, right? To get a good paying job? - I guess that's one way to look at it. But you know, some people go because they wanna learn about something that they love or something that they wanna do. - Yeah, I don't really think I have anything like that. - No, maybe you do, you just haven't found it yet. - No, I just don't think I have anything. - All right, fair enough. All right, this was a good game, I better head home. Thank you so much for inviting me, it was fun. - Yeah. - Are you okay? It seems like, something is bothering you. - Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's just there's been a lot going on at the house with Michael home, but that's it. - Yeah, I can't imagine. Alright, gotta go. - Hey, do you think it's weird that I invited you? - No, why? - I mean, I know we don't know each other that well, but I don't really know anyone here and I invited you because you seemed nice. - Lisa, I'm glad that you invited me. See you Monday. - See you Monday. - [Jackie] Nice meeting you Don. - [Don] Good to meet you too. - [Jackie] Good game. Bye kids. - What do you do with the ball, you make a pocket with a pocket. Good, okay, come on. - Hey, you know I can't take them today, right? You gonna take them? - Yeah, I know, I know. It's all right, we've already made plans. - All right, see you later. - Don't you care what my plans are with your kids? - Okay Justine, let's go. - Are we coming with you guys? - No, you're going with Papa Don. - Remember Drew? We have our secret thing with Papa Don. - Oh yeah. - Mom, we have a secret thing with Papa Don and we can't tell you. - [Lisa] Good for you. - Say bye to Justine there. - Bye Justine. - Bye Justine. - Bye. - Come on guys, let's go, give me that. - It's heavy. - Yeah, I know. [upbeat music] - Don't we need to check on dad? - No, mom's gonna come home and take care of him. Where do you wanna go after this? - I don't know, maybe go to somewhere we've never been before. [phone vibrates] - We'll hello there? Glad to see you can make it out Don. - Miss Hughes. - Thank you. - Thank you for the invite. - Look, it looks like the kids have already made some friends. - That's great, that's great. And I threw together a little something. - Nice, well thank you. I'm so glad you could make it, thanks for coming out. - [Don] Thank you. - Okay. - Just gonna put this here. - What? - I don't know. - Okay, let's say you're back. - Okay. - Where have you been? - We were at the softball game and then we went to lunch and- - I have been calling you all day, why weren't you answering? - I didn't really have my phone on me. - Please take Justine into her room and then come and speak with us. I'll give you your bath in few minutes, okay Justine? - [Michael] So trust me. - Okay, okay, all right. You cannot just leave all day and not communicate with us. - We were having fun and I wasn't looking at my phone. - First of all, you have no right to determine how our daughter will be spending her days. The way you spoke to me earlier is completely unacceptable, you work for us. So if we decide that Justine's gonna stay home, that's the end of it. - You hired me to take care of her, I follow her routine. You're the ones that told me on the weekends she can go do other things. I mean, do you really think it's fair to make her sit up here with you all day? Just because you're home and your leg is hurt? You're just using her so that you have someone to hang out with? - Okay, Lisa. [laughs] She was playing with Michael and I told you to ask him whether she could go to the game now, I don't know why you're so upset. - I'm not upset, I'm just telling you that you're saying I'm hurting Justine and- - No, we never said you're hurting Justine- - Allison stop. Lisa, I think it's time for you to go. - No, Michael- - She needs to go home. This is ridiculous, we're not gonna argue with her about how to raise our daughter. - Yeah, okay. - [Don] Don't fight. - [Drew] No. - You gonna fight all the time, everything? - [Drew] Yes. - [Maya] Yes. Exactly. - [Don] Oh hey, how was work? - It was fine. - Dammit. - Why? - You can't speak, she hears us. - We don't care about her either. - Stop Maya. Mrs. Hughes told Papa Don to let her be sad, right Papa? - Yeah, that's right. That's right. - Last one. - Here we go. - This is the last one. - Whoops. - You got it? All right. - Hey, can you come in here please? - So Michael and I need some time to think about what's going on here. - What does that mean? - [Michael] You don't need to come tomorrow. - Am I fired? - We just need some time. We have some concerns about your relationship with Justine and the influence that you have on her. We need to decide if we wanna keep you on as her nanny, we figure that tomorrow is a good time. It's her surgery and we've scattered- - What do you mean the influence I have on her? She loves me, we get along great. - You tell her she should be gonna a real school. She's been asking me questions about things she can only could have heard from you, things that quite frankly, I don't want my eight year old asking. - The N word? Oh, no, no, she learned that word from you, right? - [Michael] Okay. - Michael. - I'm sorry if she repeated something I said about you, but it's not like my statements are unfounded, right? I mean, it's statistically proven that African-American men don't play an active role in their children's lives, right? - Wow, is this a fucking joke? - [Michael] Okay, all right, you know what? You need to go, I think you need to go. - You know, I don't give a fuck what you think about my kids father. Honestly, I don't care if you think he got me pregnant and left, I don't care if you think he's in prison, it's not my job to care what you think about me or my mixed race kids. My job is to make sure your daughter has a few hours of happiness each day before she has to see your fucking evil face again. - [Allison] Okay, that's enough. - [Michael] Wow, you're really crazy, Let me tell you- - Laugh at me, you people are so fucked up. - [Michael] Can you not? - I see the way you look at me and my kids. - [Allison] Okay, Justine is writing- - For the two months, I've been sitting on a fucking bar stool 'cause that's the only place I'm allowed to sit. - [Allison] Michael. - Right? Because I'm supposed to stay in these areas. - [Michael] Hey you know what? - These are the areas I'm supposed to be in, this- - [Allison] Justine, it's okay. - [Michael] Could you put that down, please? - This is what you offer me to sit on? - Okay, enough. - 'Cause I'm not good enough to sit on your fucking couch? Who are your people? - [Michael] Hey you know what? You need to go now, please thank you. - Do you really think it's best for her to sit in this house all day? She can go to school, you know? Why don't you give her a chance? - [Allison] That's enough. - Why don't you give your daughter a chance, Michael? - Hey. - You've written her off. You've written your daughter off. - Okay, enough, that's enough. - You need to go now, please. - [Allison] Get her- - [Michael] Thank you, you need to go. It's okay, Tinnie, it's okay. Can you please, please go, thank you. It's okay. [sighs] [breathing heavily] [soft piano music] [car engine revs] [soft music] [opens door] - I washed everything. I washed, everything. [inhales] [soft music] [sobs] [soft music] [sobs] [soft music] - [Papa Don] Hey, get in the shower, we're gonna be late, quit playing around. - [Drew] Hi mama. - [Drew] Hi mom. - Hey. - Where's your van? - There was something wrong with it, they took it to the shop. - Oh, come on, I'll take you. - It's fine, it's not that far, I'll just walk. - Well, it's gotta be a few miles. - I'm good. - Bye, mom. - Yeah, there she is. What is she doing? [jazz music] [phone buzzing] - Hello? - [Shellman] Hello, is this Lisa Wade? - Yes. - [Shellman] This is your CAO Captain Shellman. I've been trying to get a hold of you the past couple of weeks. Have you received my messages? I spoke with your father-in-law and he told me he hadn't been able to get in contact with you either. Have you been in touch with him? - Yes. - [Shellman] Well, I'm sure he's informed you that the investigation has been closed. - No. No, I haven't spoken with him about it. - [Shellman] No? - Can you please give me the full report? - [Shellman] Of course. Staff Sergeant John Wade was out on patrol with his unit, it was initially reported that the patrol came into contact with an unknown vehicle. The investigation found that there was confusion within the unit and some believed the driver to be armed when he was in fact, not armed. When the vehicle in question approached the unit, it crossed into an unauthorized zone and the unit began to fire. Staff Sergeant John Wade was attempting to cease fire when he was shot. The investigation has been closed as we've confirmed that he was shot and killed in friendly fire, you will receive the full death gratuity. Your father-in-law informed me that you've already made contact with the local VA? - No, but what about the marine who shot him, what happened to him? - [Shellman] Ma'am, we were unable to identify the origin of the bullet, therefore, no further action has been taken. - But during the autopsy didn't you look at the bullet, can't you tell whose gun it came from? Somebody have to see what happened, did you ask everybody that was there? - [Shellman] Ma'am I have no further information at this time, what NCIS decides to investigate further is up to them, not us. You will receive a copy of the entire investigation. We encourage all our widows and family members to use the VA for brief and counseling and if you have any questions about your benefits. [soft music] Mrs. Wade? - Yeah. - [Shellman] Once again ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss. - So is this it? - [Shellman] I'm sorry ma'am, I'm not sure what you're asking. - Do we talk again or is this it? - [Shellman] Like I said ma'am, we encourage you to use a VA and the services they provide. There are several support groups where you may find comfort and you're welcome to call me if they need to. - Got it. [soft music] [sobs] [phone buzzing] Hello? No, I'm not there today. Well, what do you mean all week? I know she's supposed to be back later today. No, they told me right after. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Thanks Jackie, I'll let you know. Bye. [phone rings] - Hello? - Don, can you come get me? - [Don] Yeah, sure. - [Lisa] I'm on Carson and Rose. - Be right there. - [Lisa] All right. [car engine revs] What the fuck? - What? Come on get in. - What are you, following me? - Buckle up. Where am I going? - Hi, I'm looking for... They're here, thanks. - [Nurse] Okay, no worries. - Did something happen? - They had some complications. Justine's shunt became obstructed and broke while they were trying to replace it, they weren't able to completely remove it. So she's sleeping now so you can't see her. They have her on a temporary drain until they decide the best way to proceed. - What, can't they just fix it? Can't they just put the new one in? - Well, they're gonna fix it but it's more complicated than that. They have to decide what to do with the existing shunt before... And she can't drain fluid on her own so until they decide what they're gonna do. - Okay well, I'll just wait, see if she wakes up, so I can see her. - Okay, he's still very upset, I'm not really sure that you should be here. - Hey, what's going on here? - Michael. - [Michael] Let's just Not. - Stop, Michael. I really, just need to say, yes. I just, I want you to know this hasn't been easy for us. I was seven months pregnant when I found out Justine has spinal bifida. - Hey Allie, come on. - Which is late. For seven months I imagine having this perfect child with no complications, just a healthy baby, like everyone else I knew and then when she was born, all this started, the surgeries, the doctors appointments. You know, it's been years and I still feel like I just found out something's wrong with my baby and I don't know how to move past that. I love Justine so much, she's my baby girl. - I know. - But I just, I want you to know we're not racist. - My husband was killed and every time I close my eyes, the first thing I see are the faces of the two guys who stood at my door and told me that Johnny was dead and I don't know how to stop seeing that and hearing that. "The president of the United States regrets to inform you, the president of the United States regrets to inform you." So, I wish I had something profound to say to help you, but, I don't know what that would be. I do know that, Justine should go to school. She should have friends, people will like her. She's pretty great. But, why don't you guys call me when she's awake and I'll come back. [soft music] Okay. - [Drew] Oh yeah, that's really easy. - [Maya] Papa Don, look. - [Drew] Try it the hard way. - [Papa Don] Looks good. - [Drew] Oh, shoot, that didn't work out. [soft jazz music] - Hey Don, can I borrow your car? I'm gonna go back and see Justine. - Yeah, sure. - You guys wanna come with me? - Yeah. - Wait, should I bring my stuff? - I don't know if it's gonna work, but bring it just in case. - We'll be in the car. - [Maya] Okay. [soft jazz music] See you Papa. - See you baby. [soft music] - Mom, I wanna get in my outfit before I see her. - Well, let's just wait until we make sure she's okay. - Okay. - We gotta ask. - See you in the morning then, thank you. - Wait, wait, wait, she's talking. Hey, how is everything? - They're almost finished up and then we can go in and see her. They decided to do another surgery in the morning and they're gonna try to remove the remaining pieces of the shunt and put a new one in. - Well that's good, right? She wants to do her talent show song for Justine. - She'd love that. - Okay, go change. - Okay. - Go ask where the bathroom is. - Okay. - Hey, be around the corner. - Hi, Justine. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - I came by earlier, but you were asleep. [giggles] - I was really tired. - I know. - Ta da! [laughs] - This is the outfit that Papa Don bought you? - Yep. - Did you already do the talent show? - Not yet, it's tomorrow night, but I have a surprise for you. - Okay, guys get it ready.
