[random noises] [footsteps] [music playing] DAVIS: Huxley. What kind of name is that? English [inaudible] DAVIS: That's no English accent you're sporting, buddy. My mother is French. Like the author Aldous Huxley. Yeah. He took drugs didn't he? Sure he did. HUXLEY: What does that have to do with me? [slapping] Oh, my nose is bleeding. Some truth finally. [inaudible]. What piece of it do you want? Listen, you little shit. Do you honestly think you can just drift in here without a how do you do... Pull the trigger that rips people's lives apart... And limp away like some little alley cat onto a new deal? You arrogant bastard. Contradictions, Huxley. I'm telling the truth! Whose truth? Yours? The truth would resonate. And I only hear part of the truth but not all of it. Now you know about resonance right? You're a musician right? So you know the fucking difference! MARKOFSKY: Say it. - All of it! MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: Coming holidays. Just look for the special... FEMALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: Prices today fell again, the result of a new trade embargo announcement by the secretary of ener... MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: And in local news here in Dickinson, another grisly discovery as North Dakota highway patrol release details of yet more victims of the now infamous Roadside Killers. From the crime scene reports indicate that the pattern of mutilation of the bodies are without doubt the same as the other victims found throughout North Dakota and Montana. Sources report two unidentified bodies... [horn] [tires screeching] [crashing] MEGAN: Mr. Huxley. WOMAN'S VOICE: Dr. Johnson, please contact radiology. Dr. Johnson, please contact radiology. I hear you're leaving us today. Hi. Good morning. How do you feel. Much better thanks. So where you from? Paris. I teach in New York, but I'm going to a music symposium in Seattle. I always wanted to see Paris. How'd you end up here? I'm on a summer break. I needed some breathing room, some space in my life. How long have you played the cello? Since I was a child. I'm a professor at Juilliard. My father played piano. Not anymore? There appear to be a lot of not anymores in my life. Sometimes I feel like I'm not going anywhere faster and faster. Sometimes I feel like I'm not going anywhere too fast. Why do you think I had the car accident? If you'd like, why don't you come to the house this evening for a home-cooked meal. A mercy meal, [inaudible]. Call me Megan please. [cello music playing] Megan! Hello. Wow. This is a really nice truck. I'm Dominique. Hi, Dominique. Megan's vertically-challenged sister. Vertically what? I'm four inches shorter than everyone else until I catch up. I'm Gerard Huxley. May I get out now? Oh! Megan, your young man is here. Oh, hello. Hi. I hope you didn't have any problems finding this place. No your map was excellent. Oh, yeah? Mmm hmm. Good. Try these? Yeah. Um, dinner will be ready in 10 minutes. OK. Just excuse me for a second. Thank you. DOMINIQUE: Come on. Careful. They're spicy. Please make yourself at home. Dom, be nice. These are great. Of course, they are. Megan's brilliant. Our mother taught her how to cook. I, however, have other attributes and talents. I just haven't figured out what they are yet. Your mother? Yes. Will she'll be here for dinner? Oh, no. No. She's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. No, she's not. She's just not actually here. Not now, not in the moment. Bogus. Liar. Dominique, mom is dead, and that's how she'll stay as long as you're in this house, OK. Do you understand? - Yes. Good. Don't listen to her. So does that mean you're going to play for us? Oh. Will we be impressed? It's for you to judge. Are you a brilliant player? Brilliant, oh, that takes many years of playing and a lot more loving... [clicks tongue]...... sorry... living than I've experienced. DOMINIQUE: He said loving. There's a Greek word for it. I thought it would be French. No, it's a Greek word. Love and passion translate the same... enthousiasmos. DOMINIQUE: Ooh, enthusiasm. I like it. MEGAN: And do you mean love or do you mean only passion? No, both. Both, of course. And, baby, that's the way I like it. And I really, really, really love your French accent. Thank you. MEGAN: So you get all these feelings from pieces of wood glued together with vibrating strings stretched across them? DOMINIQUE: Oh, those vibrations, they travel down through your chest and into your belly. MEGAN: And everywhere? Absolutely everywhere. Why don't you guess? And what happens when they get there? Yeah, you can tell us. We won't tell anyone. [laughing] OK, guys, it's time. Let's do it, Huxley. Do what? [laughing] Hey. Dad. Dad, wake up. Wake. Dad. Dad, this is the man I met at the hospital. I told you about him remember? He's the musician, dad. Hello, sir. Take out your cello? OK. A chair. MEGAN: Pardon me? I need a chair please. Oh! ROBERT: Close the door and pull the drapes. Not a single note must be allowed to escape. Do it now. I want the fullness of the sound [inaudible] layer of my stature. Did you know, musician, that when you were lie dying, your body gives off an odor similar to floor polish? No, sir, I didn't. Musician, are you excellent? I may not be [inaudible],, but I think so. I didn't ask what you think. I asked what you know. Are you excellent? My fellow musicians think so? Yes. By all means then play. [playing cello] [crying] [items falling] [cello stops] [retching] I'm gonna go watch TV. Think we had enough excitement for one night. ROBERT: I'm sorry. You need to rest. I'll be back to give you your medication, and then you can get some sleep. OK? MEGAN: Good night. Thank you for a great dinner. Good night. Oh, you really are a talented for a teacher. Do you think maybe we could... [door slamming] Maybe. [groaning] Fine. The heartache and backache. [chuckles softly] PREACHER: We memorialize the passing of Robert Denright, and we share in the joy and the happiness he's given us throughout his life. Megan and Dominique greatly appreciate your attendance to honor the memory of this good man and loving father. [speaking latin] Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, amen. Amen. [bell tolling] Huxley! Hey! I miss the truck. Hey, you. I want to thank you. For what? For showing up at the funeral uninvited. I know you felt awkward about it, but it was really thoughtful of you. I admit I've never crashed a funeral before. Well, I'm glad you did. Maybe I should go now. I'll get my cello. You don't have to leave. The sofa's very comfortable. And I don't want to be alone. Fine. I'll get the blankets. [heavy breathing] [megan giggling] Come here. Touch. [playing cello] Wood has pores like skin. It can breathe. Sounds one way when it's cold and another when it's warm. Do it again. [playing cello] [laughing] Morning. Good morning. Sleep well. Sure. What about you? You're still here. Mmm hmm. It's true. Dom. Yes? Are you OK? Oh, fine. Listen, come over here. I've got a great idea. OK. Gerard's heading out to Seattle. Why don't we go with him for a while? We need a break from all this, a holiday. We could show him our special place. Gerard? Oh, sure, sure. I'd love the company. Big sister, have you ever considered the concept of restraint or consideration or even good taste, or is that little brain between your legs working overtime again? What's with you? Our father's not even cold yet, and moments later, you're fucking Huxley's brains out in our house. What's with me? What's with you? Oh! Correction. Pardon me. There is something in you. You're disgusting! [slapping] HUXLEY: Come on. Stop! Megan. That was quite a performance you put on last night. Shut up! Please stop! That's a very nice butt on you, Huxley. How many times a week do you work out? You watched us! I have to warn you she likes to be on top, but I think you've already noticed that. Little bitch! Never say never. Never what? Get to be on top. Ever again. Sister, you'll never know what it's like. They say it's overcompensation caused by... Dom, I'll throw you out of this house forever! - Massive - Megan! - I mean it. - Megan. - Crippling... - You're dead! - Insecurity. - Megan! That's it. [slapping] (LAUGHING) Oh my god. I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. But stop it right now please! He actually bought it. He did. You are so brilliant. The look on his face, did you see it? Hey, why do you have to hit me so hard? Sorry. You moved. Did you plan this? No. [laughing] Coffee? [laughing] [blows kiss] - Hey. - Hey. Hey! Hey. Are we finally getting out of here! What a break! More like a prison break! Goodbye, house. Good riddance. DOMINIQUE: Let's go! MEGAN: Dom, what's that? DOMINIQUE: An umbrella. HUXLEY: Careful. MEGAN: What do you need that... DOMINIQUE: It may rain. MEGAN: Give it... HUXLEY: You're crazy [inaudible].. MEGAN: I'm sorry. [interposing voices] [dominique laughing] I'm coming up in the front. No, no, no. You awake? Yeah. - Feel like talking? - Sure. Thanks a lot. You know, I've never enjoyed anyone's company ever. Absolutely ever? Hmm ever as much as I do yours. I know. I feel the same. HUXLEY: I want to know everything. There's a moon. He was a mere child in the world, but he didn't cry for the moon. Dickens. Second year in literature. [laughing] What? MEGAN: Oh my god. You're a desperate romantic. No! 'Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon. Shakespeare. Third year lit. Uh oh. God. You two are making me sick. If I have to hear any more of this mush ball poetry, I'm gonna vomit all over Huxley. MEGAN: I'm so glad you're awake, honey. He didn't cry for the moon. Saccharin shit. Are you were always such a sour bitch when you first wake up? Oh, sure. Get us alone on a desolate highway and your real colors show through. Eat me, Huxley. Dom! Go back to sleep. DOMINIQUE: You'd like that wouldn't you? [service bell ringing] Hello. Hi. Can you fill it up please? I reckon I can handle that. You ain't from around here are you? What makes you say that? Call it a hunch. Just 'cause I work here doesn't mean I'm slow. Hey, what's that? A cello. A jello? No, a cello. You know, that kind of big fiddle? Uh big fiddle, huh. Never seen one of those before. Hey, you play country music? - No. That's too bad. Is that gonna be it? Yeah, just some coffee. Dominique! Dominique. He's so cute. Oh, yeah. [engine turns over] [service bell rings] MEGAN: What's that? HUXLEY: Oh my god. Hello, sir. What happened? Driver's license and registration please. Oh, sure. What is that? What? Oh, a cello. I'm a musician. Cello. What's your name, ma'am? Dominique Denright. I'm Megan, her sister. Where you going, sir? We are passing through on the way to Seattle. All right, move along, sir. Thanks. [engine turns over] [interposing voices] [country music playing] (SINGING) Now the night's slippin' to the years. Some say what have you got to show. But so few understand you can't hold in your hand all the music and the laughter and the tears. So you sing la da da da da da, and you dance la da da da da da. I have a question? Yes. Why does your sister wear a wig? Because she's been pulling her hair out. DOMINIQUE: Look who I have here. Hello. HUXLEY: Hello again. MEGAN: Sit down. DOMINIQUE: Sit down. Thank you. What a pleasant surprise. Hi. I'm Toni from the gas station. And this is Mike. This is Gerard, our friend. Gerard. Are you following us or what? Yeah because we've been following you. [giggling] No, it's really great to see you again. Where you guys going? Did you hear what she said? She asked us where are we going. Wherever the wind takes us. Here's to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. So how do you all know each other? Um, Gerard's on summer vacation. We're taking a vacation. Great. How's it going so far? - Boring. - Boring? - Fine. Really. OK, guys, we have to go now. I'm sorry. DOMINIQUE: No! I'm sorry. We are leaving. No, Gerard. Please, no. Stay. Now apparently we got some kickass fiddle player in the crowd tonight. Wherever you be, get on up here. [cheering] DOMINIQUE: Gerard! Gerard! Gerard! Gerard! Gerard. Did you do this? [laughing] To Gerard! Come on, Gerard! So, um, what do you want to play? [foot stomping in time] [playing cello like fiddle] [applause] HUXLEY: Megan. Megan. Yeah? Read the map for me. Where are we? I think we have a problem. Watch for a sign. MEGAN: There. Mammoth Falls, 200 miles. 200 miles! Gerard, where are we! There was a turnpike two hours ago, and I took the wrong exit. Oh, man. Look maybe we could wait there until the rain stops. I'm going to stop here. [knocking] Yes. Hi. Excuse me for bothering you, but we're sort of stranded. My wipers are broke and the rain is... You got company do you? If we could just stop here for a little while until the rain stops. Well, get your friends and get them on in here. Thank you very much. I'm Judge Winston, and how are you tonight? I'm Gerard Huxley, and this is Megan and Dominique Denright. Nice to meet you, sir. Nasty out there, isn't it. We'll be out of here as soon as it lets up. Oh, listen, I'm happy for the company. I don't think it's going to let up all that soon. Come on in and sit down, make yourselves at home. Thank you. I have to pee. Shhh. I have some coffee. Would you like some? - Yeah! Oh, that'd be really nice. Thanks. Why don't you put some more wood on the fire there. I'm so used to it that I forget it's kind of chilly. We'll warm it up. HUXLEY: How long have you been living here? WINSTON: About five years. Used to live in Billings before I retired. HUXLEY: You have a very beautiful home. You live here all by yourself? I tolerate my own company with the help of my books, and this house keeps me busy. Seems to fit my needs. Well, anyway you kids are certainly welcome to spend the night if you like. You sure this is OK? I feel like we are putting you out. No, no. Not at all. I have enjoyed your company. There's a guest bath at the top of these stairs. And if anybody needs to warm up, there is a big old fashioned bathtub, which I heartily recommend because they don't make tubs like that anymore. How big is the bathtub? Big enough for about three of you and still get the dog in. MEGAN: Thank you very much, sir. It's really very kind of you. Oh, not at all. Not at all. Well, good night. Don't let the bugs bite. Good night. - Good night. Good night. DOMINIQUE: Good night. [water splashing] Megan. Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing? MEGAN: What is it? It's me, Gerard. Mr. Winston seems to be playing peeping Tom. WINSTON: What are you talking about? I think you know. You bastard. I don't have to take this. Get out of my house. Now or I'll call the police! Get out! What a fucking pervert! MEGAN: Dominique. Where's Dominique? HUXLEY: Isn't she with you? No. Find her. Oh my god, if he has touched her... Dominique. Dominique, where are you? MEGAN: Go look downstairs. I'll get dressed. Dom! [knocking] Dominique, where are you! Did she look pretty in the bath tub? Do you think I'm beautiful? I've died and gone to heaven. That's how beautiful you are. Do you think that I have nice hair? Oh, yes. Oh, it's the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. Ever. It's so much prettier than your sister's. Do you love me? Dom. Dom. Dominique. DOMINIQUE: No, you're not gonna touch me. [winston grunting in pain] Dom, what are you doing? Dom, give me the gun. WINSTON: I had an honorable profession in real life. Superior Court judge. Perfect life. With respect but without any vestige of truth, rotting in a swamp of deceit stained with my own semen. Dom, put the gun down. Please put it down. WINSTON: Have you got it yet? I'm here because I can't see people, can't be around them. They make me sick. It's always there. MEGAN: Dom. WINSTON: Always... [gasping] WINSTON: Have you ever felt it? MEGAN: What are you doing? WINSTON: Heat, blood rush. You can't stop it. Shut up, Winston. Shut up and move away from the gun. Move. Firm [inaudible] this. There's no distance at all. The first time, first dozen times, you still have a chance maybe. But not now. Not now. Dom. It's gone too far. I've got to stop now. [gunshot] Dominique. She saw him watch me. [dominique weeping] Oh my god. May I come in? [gun cocks] Dom. May I sit down? Dom. Please. Please. Dom, please give me the gun. HUXLEY: Hey. He was a judge. We have to call the police. Dom, he did it to himself. Didn't he? Please give me the gun. Dominique, please give me the gun. Just put it down. It's right here. I'm just gonna put it here OK. [heavy breathing] Dominique. It's OK. Everything's gonna be OK. There's an angel under my bed. MEGAN: That man, he was just like dad. DOMINIQUE: Yeah. MEGAN: Wasn't he? Yeah. Do you remember when daddy used to stand outside the bathroom door watching you, waiting for the nerve to come in? And I would press my eye to the keyhole, and I would see him unbuckling his pants, telling you to get on your hands and knees and say I love you so much. I know. I know. But what could we do? We were just children. No. We should have done it years sooner. Give me that gun. Megan, we only killed half a monster. Killed? DOMINIQUE: We took turns, giving him the pills. I'd give him some, then she gives him some. And then I take the last handful. And I walk over to him. Shhh. And I lean over and I whisper in his ear, "Daddy, we killed you." [retching] MEGAN: I wouldn't give anymore thought about the police. Is that for me? What are you going to do, Gerard? Who are you? What I have I become a part of here? It was an accident. Was it? How do I believe that? I liked my life. Didn't love it but it worked. I needed a change, but this was a little more than I bargained for. Come inside the house. There's another storm coming. Wait, Megan, we need to talk. I don't think so. What are we gonna do? We're going to drive away and never look back. What happens when they find the body? We'll be long gone. Nobody knows we're here. If we move quickly, we'll be all right. It was an accident? How do we tell the police that she was standing in his bedroom with a shotgun aimed at his chest? [laughs incredulously] DOMINIQUE: Hey! I am so... I am so sorry. I hope you're not upset with me. MEGAN: Dom, clean up inside. [police siren] You angry with me. Yes. And confused. We're taking a road trip. You move on. We'll take a train back home. Are you wondering if you know too much? Define too much. No one will believe what happened. You'll be blamed. Drugged up foreign musician has reckless car accident. Seduces local nurse, commits murder. I've seen it on the news a million times. [laughs nervously] That's sick. Who would believe it? I've got his wallet, his credit cards. What does it look like? [phone ringing] I feel a lot safer with you pumped full of caffeine, Huxley. I can't say the same about you. Why are you so mean to me? Don't even think about it. Of course, I'm going to think about it. Who were you calling? That's personal. How's the coffee? Cold, bitter, and nasty. You'd love it. [horn honking] [yawning] That way. Pardon me? That way south. I know where I am now. It's 73 West. We're taking a side trip. But I thought we were going to... When you get us there, you can leave. No. Fuck that! Are you crazy! Are you trying to kill us! I'm throwing you out! What are you doing! The right thing. You should try sometime you know. We're going to see my mother! OK! What? She doesn't know your father died? That's right. What? You got nothing to say. Just fucked up. It's always fucked up. I'm just trying to change it. What do you want to do? [engine turning over] Do you believe in god? You must be joking. No. No, I'm not joking. Do you believe in god? Why do you want to know? Because I asked you. God was an event that happened a long time ago. An event? Yeah. The beginning and the end. The Big Bang. You could say that, yes. So god is dead? No. We are what's left. We're god's leftovers? I fucking hate leftovers. [laughing] Oh, no. Don't... don't... don't slow down. Just ignore them. [police siren] And Jesus, Mary, Mother of god. Oh, Dominique. What? I have to... Your turn. I promise I won't look. What are you doing? You know what I'm doing. You just don't know why. You don't need to do this. You're a threat. What... what could I do? What could I say? You've already done it, Huxley. What? You're taking my sister away from me. She's in love with you or at least with the idea of you. My mother's gone, and my father's dead. And now you're trying to take my sister away from me. I don't want to be alone. I can't! I can't be alone. But it's not true. I mean... I heard what you said with Megan. It's a Big Bang speech. Yeah, let's really talk about it. Life and death meet face to face. It's your end and our beginning. You can't have her. What? But this is sick. You Americans with all your guns. But I don't fucking care anymore. Megan, she's your lunatic sister. Take that gun the fuck away from her or finish it. I'm fed up with the two of you and all of these totally insane shit. Do it. [laughing] You actually bought it, and your fly was open the whole time. [inaudible] bullshit. Please, Gerard, don't be angry. Come on. Get away. Just stop. Just stop. I'm really sorry. Come on. It's not funny. I love you. We love you, Gerard. Did you hear that? Come on, Gerard. Please, Gerard. Get into the car. DOMINIQUE: Is he sleep? Megan, do you consider Gerard your boyfriend? Let's not talk about Gerard. DOMINIQUE: Let's talk about Gerard. Shhh. He's sleeping. (WHISPERING) Is he a good kisser? Is he a good kisser? MEGAN: I'm not telling. Yes, you want to tell me. MEGAN: No! I can see you wanting the words wanting to come out. I'm not... DOMINIQUE: Come on. Yes. DOMINIQUE: Yes. Great? Mmm hmm. What the hell? DOMINIQUE: What are they doing here? Oh my god. Oh what a coincidence. Oh, this is great. Yes, it's us. I cannot believe this. Hello, again. Our car has had it. [chuckling] - Hey. - Hi. - How are you. - Can we get a ride? Just to the nearest gas station. We'd really appreciate it. Well, I... I guess we could do that. Nice of you to help out. Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car, bitch! Come on, little angel. Come on! Now! Get around the car. Come on. [gerard struggling] Pathetic. [blows raspberry] Up against the car. Wallets, rings, purses, everything in the front seat. (SINGING) Gotta make a living, living. We have been following you for miles and miles. And then poof, you disappeared. But here you are all warm and cuddly. Fucking fate, man. I can't believe it. Fate is the bitch I always wanted to fuck. Mmm. Where are you from? New York. You don't sound like New York. You sound like France. He's a professor. French professor. I teach music, only music. Oof. A Frenchman in America. Get it. Like the movie "An American in Paris." Gene Kelly. "Singing in the Rain." Wrong picture. MIKE: (SINGING IN FRENCH) TONY: Mike. Mike, do you hear yourself? Huh? You're talking again. Look, I don't know why I put up with him. He consistently takes the fun out of it. All right. I want her, the young one. All right. I'll take the other one Leave her alone! [sinister laughing] All right. I want you, little girl. No! No! [screaming] Don't touch my hair! No. HUXLEY: You've got what you want, I mean rings, credit cards, everything! Look in the car if you don't believe us. He's got something that's worth much more! What! The cello! The cello. MEGAN: Yes. MIKE: What's it worth? MEGAN: Tell him! You fucker, tell him the truth! 70,000. Dollars? Stop it! Stop! For real? Yes, for real. Fuck me, dead. Tony, come here. Come here. Open it. Lift it up. You would do it. It's too heavy for me. HUXLEY: Be careful with it. If you break it, it's not worth anything. I never handled one of these before. TONY: Play me a song, Mike. [sinister laughing] Whoo! [playing note on cello] Tony, look at this. Look at me! I'm Johann Sebastian fucking Bach. [laughing] [cocks gun] [gunshot] [mike panting] [gasping] [cocks gun] Drop it, you son of a bitch! [struggling] Stop her! Dom, please! Come back. Stop! Dominique! [gunshot] TONY: Oh, fuck! You fucking bitch! You shot me! I fucking danced with you! Ha, ha! Ha! [gunshot] What did you do? Dom. Dom, what did you do? Are you OK? Better than he is. Aww, man, did you pick the wrong car? Will you wait? We won't be long. Please. I'll wait, yes. [police radio] [knocking] Mom. What the fuck? Hi, mom. Haven't you ever heard of a phone? Come on, give me a hug. You changed your number again. You have a habit of doing that. BERYL: Oh, shit. Ah, you got your look now. Get out. I'm not going anywhere. BERYL: Get out! And take her with you. MEGAN: Leave her alone! Megan. Are you all right? Who the fuck are you? He's our friend. Well, you're not invited. Get out. He stays. He earned it. BERYL: Well, I don't want him here. Get out. What's with the fucking French accent? You some sort of waiters? [laughing] Gerard Huxley, our mother, Beryl Denright. HUXLEY: I should leave. Mum, I'll wait outside. Please. Please stay. You may as well hear everything. OK. BERYL: Here we are, one big happy family. You must have had a reason to come here. Certainly wasn't to see your dear old mom, was it? It's money you can't be looking for. [laughing] What the fuck? What do you got on your head? Is that a fucking wig! - No! No! No, don't do that to me. Don't you touch her! What's the matter with your brown hair? What the fuck is the matter with you? Dominique and I came to tell you about our father, your husband. Remember? What about him? He died. [wailing] So good riddance to [inaudible]. That would you want me to say? Or what would please you, huh? What would please you? That I hated him? And that I loved him? And I'll miss him terribly. Which is it because either way I can't win with you. If I loved him, you'll hate me because you hated him. And if I hated him, you're going to hate me because I left. So what do you want? Maybe I got both answers for you. For once, the truth. Whose truth? You fucking left us, you gutless drunk! What's inside you? What's left in there besides the cheap scotch and the rotting cum from simple... You shut the fuck up! At the local bar! Shut the fuck up! Where were you when he came into my bedroom? Oh, you shut your filthy mouth. He never laid a goddamn hand on you! Megan... These are lies! You're lying! Megan, you leave her alone. She can't handle [inaudible] I'm not gonna listen to this. I'm not listening. You get outta here! Get out. Oh, no. For one last time in your pathetic life, you can't leave. I knew it was always you he was thinking about. It was you he was lusting for. You took him from me. You took him from me. You're lying. You're lying. You can't make someone love you who doesn't want you anymore. I couldn't stop him. I had to go. It was always me. It was me he was trying to hurt. Wasn't you. It was me. You... you actually believe this shit, don't you? Haven't you've figured this out yet, Miss Smarty Pants. Going to school like you're something special. What? You're not your father's daughter. You're not your father's daughter. You're not your father's daughter. He was always traveling around somewhere. I was bored. I was lonely. I got knocked up. I don't even remember his goddamn name. You're lying. Every time he looked at you, he saw another man's daughter. Every time. And he wanted his revenge. Well, he got it, baby. He got it. You're not your daddy's little girl. At least not by blood. Megan. [screaming] You can't! Go to the car. Go to the car. Oh, my baby. My beautiful baby. If I had taken you with me, he would a come after me. Don't you see, baby. I'm just not strong enough. I'm just not strong enough. Oh, baby. I wasn't strong enough. Please don't hate me. Please, baby, don't hate me. You couldn't hate me as much as I hate myself. Oh, baby. [wailing] It's over. What are you looking at? Nothing. I'm looking at nothing. Do you always keep your word? You didn't leave. You could've. You're the first man I've ever really trusted. I haven't cried in seven years. What does it feel like? Dom, what's it like? It's wet. [laughing] Pull over please. [hyperventilating] [crying] [music playing] [balls break] (SINGING) But now that's over, knee deep in clover, I will soon be found. I'm on my way now almost any day now I'm Delta bound. [balls break] COP 1: Mister. Hi. Nice day. Yeah. Police officers. Don't move. COP 1: Get off the table. So let me get this straight. You're coming out of the storm. You steal his money. You shoot him with his own shotgun. Is that how it happened? No, no, no. Here's what I think happened. You're a foreigner. You're on drugs. Drifting into a small town, you see this pretty little nurse. She's sexy. So you take her for a little joyride. Now something goes wrong. I understand. I understand. It's all right. Just say it. How did Megan Denright get the shotgun? When Mike set it down at the back of a car when he lifted out the cello. He actually said the shotgun down. Yes. This is bullshit! [whispering] (WHISPERING) We're gonna have to let him go. [inaudible] Uh, you're free to go. What? Megan Denright confessed to killing the two boys. Self-defense she said. And it adds up. We found Judge Winston's credit cards and some jewelry on the guy you called Mike. So those two guys killed Winston... Winston. They were serial killers. Those bastards were picking off people all over the country. You're lucky to be alive. Why did you pick us up? We found a piece of sheet music in a ditch by the body. Beethoven turned you, Mr. Huxley. MARKOFSKY: You were easy to track. You know, Mr. Huxley, the situation with you and the two girls, it's a little smelly. But justice has its own way, just like god. It's unbelievable. Do you hear the tall grass blowing in the wind how it hisses? Pure music. Worth the hike. This is your special place? We used to live down here, a few miles away when we were kids. We love it here. You OK? Huh? Remember when we were kids at the lake? And I used to throw the biggest rocks in the water and try to make the biggest waves and the sound of the water gulping up the stones. And the huge splash. It's all different now isn't it? (WHISPERING) Do angels fly? Do angels fly? [celestial music playing] [singing in latin] Do angels fly? [horn] Dominique! No! [tires screeching] You OK? [crying] Megan? This is goodbye. She... MEGAN: I know. When we get home, I'll see she gets professional help. I never... I never thought my cello would save my life. I saved your life. Yes, Megan. I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. Dominique. You can't read it until I'm gone. Dear Gerard, I'm not sure my life is going, but I feel strangely content. I can only hope that in time, Dominique will feel the same. Your music taught me that beauty really does exist in this world, and that within all of us, we must find that special place for ourselves. Just as the spaces between the notes fill me with anticipation for the next one, in life, those moments can mean so many things. Perhaps one day, I'll see you at a concert, and I'll walk up to you. And I'll smile and hope until our paths cross again. Love, Megan. [playing cello] [theme music playing]
