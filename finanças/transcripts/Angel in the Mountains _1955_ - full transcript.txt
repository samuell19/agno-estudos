The next point is an announcement of Spofana's best workers. The best one from research and laboratories section is chemist-technician Zdenek Soukup. The best in syringelsection, just like last year, is our excelent team, Vera Matouskova and Vera Novotna. I'm glad to award you honourable f ags of exemplary workers. I hope you'll keep your position as best workers also in the future. That's not all. The works council has arranged another reward for you. This one is for Vera Matouskova. This one is for Vera Novotna. And this voucher is for Zdenek. I wish you to enjoy your one week vacation in our Tatra Mountains. Zdenek, that's great, we're going to Tatras together. Yes, but my brother has my skis in Krkonose Mountains. Just my uck! This chap Pivonka comes along and now I have an inspection in the train. And then night duty. For Pivonka. You shouldn't have taken it. Don't moan now. What else to do? You know his daughter's getting married. Where's your fur cap, dear? - I've got it in my bag. Would you like some tea with you? - No, just a hanky, or better two. Listen, our son seems to take an interest in his appearance. I'am sure he's again taken my best tie, he's good at that. Come on, he's got enough of his own. He's got enough of his own, but minelseem to be fine as well. And he's messy. When he puts a thing down it stays there. Your fault, still I clearing up after him. I'd tell him to get a move on! One day he'll deeply remember of his home. It's time he got a wife as well. Thank you. Everyone's getting married, except him. You'll also see him married. - He's taking his time about it. He said in the spring. What? So soon? You say it's high time and now you're surprised. Have you got your gloves? Hopefully I may a so know what happens in this family. You wouldn't te anything and I'm not going to force the boy to speak. Mirek wouldn't be forced. Anyway, now you know. What do I know? I know nothing. Look, our son! Wherever you touch . . . I know they'd end me skis in the holiday home. But who knows what sort of rubbish they'll be. I'll tell Mirek to end you his. Really? And when could I go and pick them up? Vera travels past Mirek's home every day. He can bring them to her at the tram tomorrow morning, if you want. But tel Mirek to be there exactly at a quarter past seven. He'll be there. We're going to be delayed here. Could you go instead, please? Fine, Vera, but I've only got on what I left the house in. It's past six already. Fine. All right. I'll get down there. What? Now, immediately. The number two's coming. Bye. Goodbye. Come round soon. Tickets, please. New passengers. Tickets, please. New passengers. Who else wants to pay? Who's got too much money? Tickets, please. Nobody? No-one without a ticket? Ticket inspection. Excuse me, I'd like to get out. All right, all right. But first show me your ticket, please. I'm sorry, but I've eft my money at home. I've heard that one before. You travel from the water works but when an inspection comes you have to get out. Conductor, please! Sometimes it isn't worth travelling without paying. Come on. - But I really don't have any money. Your ID, please. I don't have it. I've left everything at home. Then I'llhave to check your authorisation. Could you get off please? please, just trave one more station with me. Someone's waiting for me there and he' I give me the money. I've other things to do than accompany you to meetings. Let's get out. I need a statement, please. - One moment. We'll get out at the next station. Statement. You're lucky. What about the ticket? I'll pay that, so nobody can say that inspectors are cannibals. please. Thank you. - Hm. There he is! - Hold on, wait until the train stops. Just be calm. Mirek, Mirek, please, end me ten crowns quickly. I got a fine in the tram and I don't have any money. It's going to be difficult, I've just bought two tickets for ice hockey. And by chance I don't have much . . . - What do you mean, by chance? That's usual for you. If I may boast, this is my father. You can boast as you want. But I can't boast of you. But Dad, let me . . . - I don't want to know anything! At least et me introduce you to ... I don't need to know, the main is you know her. Here's a notepad, you owe me ten crowns. You two sort it out as you wish. But I sti owe you for the ticket! I can give you sixty hellers immediately. No need! We' I sort it out at home! Is that your father? That's scary. Here! Good morning, Vera. Good morning, Mirek. You're very nice. How did it turn out with your father? Match postponed, the opponent didn't come to the scrum, he'd night service. Vera, could you . . . - Of course. Goodbye, Mirek. Bye! Old grumbler! Good morning. Good morning, Gustav. You didn't meet Mirek? No, but I saw him. Who was he taking the skis to? He said to end them to someone. - To someone. I know, to someone. Yesterday evening he a so wanted to end someone something. Yes, dear, so that you know what was going onlyesterday. Mirek is dating a gir called Vera. - Yes, Vera, I a ready know it. And that ady was her mother and she was coming to tell Mirek that Vera would be ate for their meeting. She came all right! Without paying! - Don't, dear. What a sort of family when mother trave s without paying. An apple doesn't fa I far from the tree. Like mother, like daughter. The works council . What do they want? That Mejzlik's gone crazy. - Who? Our entertainment officer. He writes here. Dear Comrade, the works council . . . and so on and so on . . . . . . for hard work. You have been chosen as an exemplary employee and ... as a reward the council has decided to send you for a winter holiday. Yes, now, in this weather. I understand. When nobody wants to go they call it a reward. When I wanted Mejzlik to give me a voucher for summer he said to me: You went ast year, you're not the only one, everyone must have the turn. And suddenly I'm good enough. So now as a reward I'm to go off and freeze in the frost or something. Eliska, please, close the window. It's b owing here like in the Letna tunnel. No, my dear chaps, l'm not going to split my holiday. I'll take it comp etely in summer to enjoy it the best way. Eliska, give me breakfast at last, it's time for bed. It's coming, it's coming. - Great. End of announcement for the head office of the Prague Transport Corporation. Comrade Chairman, we have to account for the winter vacation vouchers by the twentieth. Mejzlik, what about those vouchers? - I haven't distributed them yet. Why not? - Why not? Why not? Most people returned them. Drabek, Jedlicka, Ba aban, no-one wants to go. And I won't get upset. I'll give the voucher to anyone who wants. That's not right. We can't send people without making a selection. You can't do that. - She's right, Mejzlik. Only the best deserve a holiday. Only the best. I know. But those best don't want to go in winter. That's your fault, Mejzlik. It seems you don't know how to convince people of winter holidays benefits. Obviously. - Why do you get so upset? You have to get inside a person. Understand how they think. Overcome a person's prejudices ... ... that a right holiday is only that in summer by the water. That's a mistake, Mejzlik. Imagine sunshine in the mountains. - An ozone without any germs. A week there is better for health than two weeks in summer somewhere by a swimming pool. You don't have to tel me. I know that. Them you should tell. I will I te them. I'll be glad to tell them. The next person to return a holiday voucher send to me. I'll show you how to promote something proper y. That's organised. Yes, I'lltell him. She's coming. Thank you. - My pleasure. What is it, Mirek? - Nothing really. What are you a doing here? I only wanted to te Vera that I'd be sad in Prague without her. So I won't go anywhere. Mirek, don't belselfish. You wouldn't want to spoil Vera's holiday? Wait, let me speak. I'd be sad in Prague without Vera and that's why I'm going to join you. - Where? In Lomnice. - How's that? I'll go with assembly group to Tatrasvit, then two stations to Poprad, from Poprad by tram and I'm there. Good morning. - Why aren't you at work? We're going to the assembly. - When? This afternoon. In the assembly van. Mummy, please get my case ready. What are you going to take? - Like always, clothes for one week. But please hurry. I have to be in the factory at two. That's right, hurry, hurry. But Mummy, just the smaller case so I don't have to ug big one around. A I right, all right. Dad, I have those ten crowns sixty I owe you from yesterday. Great. Did she give you the money back? Yes. Vera gave me the money. Here it is. Did Mummy tell you what happened yesterday? She did, and we don't have to talk about it anymore, do we? Don't wink at each other. Do you think I don't see it? This is the etter about holiday. What sha I I do with it? I'd almost forgotten about it. Let them make someone else happy. Mummy, did Dad get a holiday? Yes, but he doesn't want it. - I'd go right away. Vera a so got one. I do believe he'd go if she's going. But if someone wants to go on holiday he has to do his best to deserve it, that holiday. Eliska, where his girl is going? - I don't know. Ask him. Why should I ask him? I'm not interested. What's it to me? But I'm interested. Mirek, where is Vera going for holiday? She's lucky as going to the Tatras. To Tatranska Lomnice. Where's she going? - Her? To Tatranska Lomnice. Why are you te ing me? Did I ask you? Let them go where they want! You don't have to shout so. He must not know I'm interested. I'm going. I'm going! Have a good trip, Mirek. - Thanks, Dad. Be careful. Don't do anything stupid. - I'm not a child. wellt sometimes seems like that. - What do you mean? Nothing. I just warn you not to underestimate your opponent. Once he might arrive on time, the match won't be postponed, you' get into the scrum with no more chance. Goodbye, son. What did Dad say? I don't understand. He's not omniscient, is he? Send me up the report on materia consumption, will you? Good morning. - Hello, Gustav. What's the matter? That holiday voucher. So, the Chairman will organise that with you. We , we . Welcome, Gustav, come in. Take a seat. Thank you, there's no point. - Take a seat, anyway. Mejzlik, the list. - It won't take a second. Here you wrote about sending me on holiday. That's right. You deserve it. Where are those lists? I'm not going. Summer holiday wasn't available and I don't want winter one. But you must understand it wasn't ist. But now, just think . . . I don't want it. - Don't shoot yourself in the foot. Do you know what a week in the mountains . . . That ozone without any germs. - And that winter sunshine. You sound like a trave agency. Why don't you go yourself? Because it's a selected holiday. I don't have any right to it. You don't have any right and I don't want to. But . . . - So, you're not going? No! - No? No! - No? That's it. - It makes me crazy. Krkonose, Spindleruv Mlyn; Beskydy, Radhost; Tatras, Tatranska Lomnice . . . Just a moment, Tatranska Lomnice? - would you go there? Where? - There, to Tatranska Lomnice. Maybe I will. I don't say right now, I'll tell you tomorrow. Wait, wait. We can't do that. They're eaving on Saturday. - So are you going or not? I am! Fill in the voucher and I'll pick it up. Goodbye. Yes, stop by. Don't forget. - It' be ready for you. You see, Mejzlik, that's promotion. I explained the real meaning of winter holidays. I aroused his interest and he's going. - It's still a bit . . . But that's it. Vera, Vera, we're here! Come and don't look over there. - Where? I'll tell you after. Come quickly and don't look! Come on. Look, there she is, do you see? - Who? Who! That Vera. - But that's a woman standing there. That's her mother. Don't stare like that. Actually, you can. She doesn't know you. Gustav, I'll get you some newspapers. would you like? So go and have a good look. Mainly at the mother. Look at the mother. Have a nice time, Vera. Be careful and come home safely. Don't worry, I'm not a child. But, please Mummy, Mirek might send me a letter today. Send it on to me. Of course. Is this free? - It is. But only for holidaymakers. Of course, thank you, thank you. Excuse me. Eliska, come here. Come on. Did you see her? - I did. And what do you think? - Shelseems to be a nice woman. Your train's about to leave, bye. - Wait! Not a woman, I meant the girl. She's a p easant girl. She just spoke about Mirek. I don't want to intrude, dear. Bye, bye, Gustav. What do you mean, intrude? I'm surprised. Such an opportunity. She'll be there without Mirek, she won't be pretending, she doesn't know me so she won't be on her best behaviour and I'll be able to check her. Young fool in lovelsees only what his heart allows and nothing else. A low me, miss. Just a moment, lift this. That's right, carry on . . . You know, Eliska, sometimes you talk as if I didn't like the boy. Would any other father in my place do this for his son, go to some Siberia and freeze there? Take care of yourself, Gustav. It's leaving, go, go! I'm not going there to look after myself. Gustav, the papers! Goodbye. You are Mrs . . . - Angel . I thought so at once when I saw your husband. We met each other recently by chance. I know. Mirek told me about it. I'm Matouskova. Vera's mother. If you haven't heard of me. I've heard and I'm very happy to meet you. Are you getting ready to sleep? - No, why? You seem to get ready a bed under you. - Oh that. A person does that without thinking. Not realising it. The rubbish bin is over there. - Right. That's where it belongs. Hygiene is a principle of decent people. Matches go in the ashtray, gentlemen. You've suddenly discovered that? - Why are you so familiar? OK, why not. We're all union men so let's be open enough to each other. Are you also going to the Tatras? - I am. Where to? Tatranska Lomnice, the Morava Holiday Home. Anything else? You're lucky. It's the best holiday home I know. Wonderful place. I'm also going there. - My pleasure. At least the trip will I go quicker. - Yes. I see you have the Wor d in Pictures. - Yes, I do. Excuse me. will I you guess who Vera's thinking about right now? Who else to be thinking about but Mirek. Why does that man keep ooking at me? Where are we? - Just coming up to Ostrava. You're not going to the Tatras? - No, to Beskydy. We're changing here. Enjoy your holiday, boys. - Thank you. willyou excuse me, please? - Of course. You are welcome. Attention! The holiday train Prague, Ostrava, Bohumin, Poprad, Tatry ... Attention! The holiday train Prague, Ostrava, Bohumin, Poprad, Tatry ... Vyhlidka! Vyhlidka! Here, Vyh idka! Angel. Is that you? - Yes, it's me. Not here. I'm sitting the next carriage. Get in and I'll join you. There's nice seat for you there. Excuse me, please. Thank you. You go den boy! I'm glad to see you again. Where are you off to? I'm going on holiday. - Are you? And where to? To Tatranska Lomnice. - So am I. Where are you staying? In the Morava. - Me too. Let's stay together again. A itt e room like before. I don't think it' I work this time. Why not? Manager may fix it. We , you see... Do I have to stand here the whole journey? Wait, young woman. Don't push my friend like that. Just say so and we'll get you by. - Well, you see . . . No problem. - You see, Gustav, this is Manicka. And? - She's my wife. Manicka, this is Gustav Angel . You remember me talking about him. I'm Angel, young lady. Forgive me, what a surprise. I'll take the skis to our p ace, there's lot of room there. You'll enjoy it. Be just careful and go on. So where is it? - We're a ready here. Two nicelseats for you. Sit down. It's very smoky in here. - We can air it. Bohous, I'm going to sit next door. - But Manicka. Here we are, that's right. Don't be upset, but Manicka hates smoke. I'll be right back. You don't have to . . . you know . . . You've met a friend here, haven't you? Yes, we were together on holiday. Where? - Lakeside. Near Javornice. I know the p ace. They've got great swimming down there. I was there in 1951 . Oh no, in 1951 I spent my holiday with my wife in Marienbad. So, it was in 1952, exactly. No, in 1 952 I was in the Low Tatras, in Jasna near Vrbicke Pleso. So I must have been there in 1950. How time flies. You must be an outstanding employee. A holiday every year. I am, I don't deny. I enjoy my work and realising that today we're working for the whole society makes our work enjoyable, don't you think? Of course it does. What do you do? - I'm in heavy industry. In smelting? - No, in machine industry. Machine industry. You're in the same field as my son. Are you a mechanic? - No, I'm a wage accountant. But I a so look after recruitment, temps, I'm in the drama department, active in P.E., I sing in a group. I'm extremely busy. And you find time for everything, even holidays. Where do you go for summer? Excuse me. May I sit down here? Here? As you wish. Come on. Then I can ook into the corridor. May I light up? Of course. Go ahead. Why did you get on in Ostrava? I thought you were a Praguer. - But this is my home now. I work here in the pit. One year and a half already. I only came for temporary work and now I'm based here permanently. So you moved here for the mining. I did. - And you immediate y got married? That was a sort of fortunate accident. A trolley jammed my thumb. - But there's nothing lucky. But because of my thumb I went to the plant surgery. And? - That's where I found Manicka. Your wife? - She is a nurse there. I was there two three times to have it rebandaged, she always complained my missing collar buttons, and then we got married before Christmas. All sorts of things can happen. The main is that you're happy. Thank you. Thank you, I am. We're off on holiday and our honeymoon at the same time. And do you ever find time to play the cello? I still play. When Manicka isn't at home I have a strum. There's a ways something, you know. Why do you keep looking out? Nothing. I'm just checking to see if Manicka's cal ed. I'll go and see if she needs anything. I'll be right back. If a person only knew in advance what to expect. A little bunny rabbit fal s head over heels and whether it' I do any good or not, he doesn't think. What? Who? - Nothing. None of your business. It's very beautiful here, wonderfu place. Warm, comfy . . . That's what I like. A little bit of paradise, Angel ? Look, Pulecek, call me better Gustav instead. You see, Angel, people tend to remember it. And Gustav, it sounds much better. Be so kind. I have my reasons for that. As you wish. What are you throwing around? - Paper from my shoes. I can see that. Look, I've had my eye only you since we arrived. Let's get things clear. I like an order and if you want to stay with me, then this sort of . . . - Fine, I'll pick it up. Coquette. Hey, sonny. Have you got a shirt under that fur coat? Be careful, four people have already frozen to death. That's all. Comrades, the skiing course for beginners will start in half an hour behind the Morava Holiday Home. Don't be angry, that I've taken up your invitation so soon. I wanted to talk about something. - Of course. What's onlyour mind? Did Mirek tell you that they want to get married in the spring? Yes, he told me. Right, but Vera is taking the whole thing rather casually. Mummy, l'm going to get married. But where they'll stay? It's up to me. Maybe she's used to you organising everything for her. I have enough space at home. l've got two rooms. But I wouldn't like to ive with them. It wouldn't work. But if they ived with us it would be worse. My husband . . . No, that didn't even cross my mind. I suppose to exchange my flat for two sma ler ones. I'd stay in studio flat. They'd have one room with kitchen. You're right. That would be the best. Or another example. A forest path a metre wide. No more. Or another example. A forest path a metre wide. No more. A s ope like a roof. Mist, g oom, almost dark. You're not back in time, the hotel sounds the alarm. They go for you. I decide. You're going downhil . I take off, take off. And it's not ooking good. Ice like a mirror. I'm flying. And suddenly you hear a quiet tinkle, tink e. And, what a he , the buckle! I try to stop. No way. Not a chance. Suddenly, a few metres away a horse and sleigh. That was that tinkle. Very good! What now? You' be ripped to shreds. In front of me I see a mound and say to myself: either or. I crouch down, fly into the mound, it lifts me up slightly, I spring, stretch, take off . . . and thud. The wood on the sleigh just scrapes my skis from be ow. By a whisker, by a whisker. And what did the horse say? - He was totally ... A horse, what would horse say? A horse doesn't . . . Comrades, we're going to the tram. - What? Where's the tram going? To Strbske Pleso. You can come with us. I'd like to. Just et me put away the skis. But we're going to go skiing. To Solisko. To So isko? That's meant to be very high, isn't it? You can get a ift up. - What you mean? There's a ift there. - I see. Watch out! Can't you be more careful? Can't you take more care, man? Of whom? - Of me, of course! Is that you Vyhlidka? - Gustav! Why do you toboggan when there are people walking? No-one's walking here except you. What? - This is the toboggan run. This? - Yes! And why isn't there any notice or something? It's at the top and the bottom. - I see. So, don't moan and get for a ride. Give me a break. Am I a small boy? Don't expect to see me like that. With me. - What's up with you? What if our wives saw us? Eliska and your . . .? Manicka. - Yes, Manicka. She's learning to ski. She doesn't like me to laugh at her when she falls down. Of course not. That's strange, I tell you. So suddenly got so much warmer. Come on, quickly. - It's like more kilos in weight. Mind the belt. - Yes, the belt, and carefully. Sit behind me. - Of course, behind you. A right. Watch out! What a scenery for skiing, isn't it? When it comes to it, I'lla so jump. I jump well, I like to jump. You can if you want. - We'll see. Look, it's Solisko. Gosh, that's refreshing, and good for the soul. No wonder you were hot. You're wrapped up like it was the arctic. Wrapped up! That's Eliska's doing, so I don't get cold. Wait and sit behind. I'll drive. You a ways brake and that's no fun. Do you know how to drive? - That's beside the point, come on! please, please. After you. I'm enough familiar with ... please, after you. Your turn, comrade. Please. Those who aren't strong skiers, don't go directly downhill, but descend slowly in arcs. We' go ast. - No, no. You go ahead. I'll wait. But you can't go straight after us. We don't go that fast. Don't worry. I wouldn't bump into you anyway. You'd just jump over us, wouldn't you? And what are you waiting for? Go! Why don't you try a toboggan? You can't harm yourself on. Why go skiing when you don't know how? I don't know how to ski? Do you know how often I was in the mountains? Make no mistake, to fa I well is also an art. A very big art! Ahh, comrade manager in person. Dinner for the invalid. I didn't want to make you trouble. I'd have tried to pick it up myself. But that's our duty, comrade Pulecek. How you feel? Is it all right? It hurts like the devil. - It's nothing, nothing. Doctor says the leg is fine and the pain will shortly be over. Thank you, thank you. You can go. He'll look after me. As you wish, at east it'll taste better. There you are. That's right. He'll serve him now. Happy to. There you are. He says 'nothing, it's nothing'. And the doctor as we . Can helsee under the skin? Let's wait what the x-ray shows. You walked home. There can't be much wrong with your leg. Walked? Stumbled! Listen, I wanted to say something. If someone gets injured on holiday that's the same as getting injured at work, isn't it? Of course it is! My employer sent me here. What do you think? I think that you think of nothing else than your own cushy job. What a cushy job? It's my right. I have to find out. It's not so simple. Everyone has a right to health. And what about the desert? Fine. They could have given two s ices when it's for a sick person. Are you ready, Vera? A most, I'll only sew up the collar. - It's taking you ages. I always leave things to the ast minute. Don't be ate, Vera. I'll sew up the collar myself. Where's your sewing kit? Don't worry. I'll use mine. You're very kind, Mrs. Ko esarova. Hurry up, they already dance. And you've got a card. From Mirek? Why didn't you bring it? Please go and get it. You've woken up all of a sudden. And can I read it? You may. 'My dear Vera, We are going to finish our work soon, shortly we will meet again. Regards and kisses from Mirek' It's a shame, sir, to read somebody else's correspondence. Oh no, I did not read it. I did only check if the card was for me. It isn't. Well, if it isn't it isn't. You don't have to get upset. Your boyfriend's writing to you, isn't he? Bohous, who else? - Josef in Brno. Done. - Aunt Zofia. Done. And don't read when I'm talking to you and help me think. Do you have the Vozenileks? No, no, no. They didn't write to us from holiday either. So, who then? - That's why I'm asking you. What about Rozde ov? - Done as well. Your doctor? A so done. Read and don't disturb me when I'm thinking. Good evening. Good evening, Gustav. Take a seat. No, thank you. May I take your Bohous away for a while? Where? - Just next door in the chess room. It's been ages ... - But you know I don't play chess. What about cards? - No. Well, that doesn't matter. I'll teach you something. Excuse us. Come on, she doesn't mind. What am I to play if I play nothing. - Nothing. Sit down. Just pretend. I want to tell you something in confidence. Don't stare like that, do it like me. Tactfu ly. Just a glance is sufficient, like that. He's sitting over there. Which one? That younger? - The scowling one. What's going on? That old man who's been checking up on me all the time. And she's dating your son and the guy besides at the same time? Don't point! Dating or not ... If I'd known I wouldn't need your help. Gustav? - Yes. Aren't you exaggerating getting involved in your son's love life? Exaggerating. Maybe for you. You don't have any children. should I sit here watching his bride to flirt with the others? That our fool in love writes to her best wishes, hugs and kisses . . . I'm sure he hasn't written his mother or me a line. Neither to you? - Does he know I'm here? And are you really sure? - Of course I am. I know her. But I don't think that she's flirting with him. Maybe they're friends only, or from the same factory. Come off it! I come across him wherever I go. You can't stop him. - But it upsets me. You see, he's sizing me up again. - Look at me and you'll be all right. Did you see? Don't tell me it's just a friendship. It's not the way people behave knowing each other only from work. It'd be like me ruffling the hair of our manager. I'd finish with him at once. If you don't know how to behave you should pack up and go home. Such philanderers don't be ong on holiday. Come on, it's nothing. You will ask her to dance and start up a conversation. Like whether her boyfriend minds and so on. She'll say something, you too and then you know what's between them. Wait a moment, Gustav. Why? You're clever, with a quick mind. But I don't dance. - Yes, but . . . I excuse myself to Manicka and now I'd dance with someone else? No way, it'd be a war at home. Are you my friend? - Realy, Gustav. Don't be upset. Ask her yourself. She doesn't know you. - What an advice! While ago I was avoiding her eye and now l'd ask her to dance? She'd be suspicious. She might ask manager who I am and when she hears Angel she'll pretend to be best and then I can't prove anything. She may not feel I'm interested in her. Play, play. Hi, Manicka. - I have no uck. Bohous, sign these cards and put them in the post-box in the hall. I'm going to bed. Good night. Don't stay up ate. I can go straight away. - please wait until we finish the game. Good night. He'll come soon. - Manicka ... Don't you enjoy sitting with me? Why are you so hurry? Of course I enjoy to be with you. - All right, so sit down. But . . . Look, she's on her own. Now you can ask her. No. - Go on! Gustav, don't ... I'll leave so she doesn't think that I sent you, a right? Vyhlidka, ook. We'll meet in the ha . Don't worry. You'll be fine. Gustav, come on . . . - We understand each other, don't we? Just go. And then come to me. 'Dear Mirek, Thanks for card. I look forward to see you. Love Vera' Do you have a stamp, please? I'm sorry I just sold the last one a moment ago. A stamp for a card? If you a low I'd like to be of assistance. I think I might have ... Thirty hellers, is it? Here you are. Thank you. You're very kind. - Don't mention it. Another time. - But anyway . . . Really, you're very sweet. Another time, another time. Thank you very much. - Not at all, not at a I. Excuse me, I'm sorry. - That's a I right. It's hot, isn't it? And outside it's so cold. That's probably because outside it's freezing and inside they're heating. Yes, probably. It's a waltz, isn't it? - You know that? What? - That they're playing a wa tz. Of course. - So why you dance a stamp dance? I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. - More than a little. But it's OK. Good evening, good evening. That's the young man who's at your table, isn't it? You don't miss anything. - Isn't he upset I'm dancing with you? On the contrary, he's glad. He likes seeing others suffer. Excuse me. - It doesn't matter. You've got a serious relationship with him, haven't you? No, a happy one. I'm sorry, you don't understand. I only want to know if you like him. Would you a so like to know what I don't like? Of course. - I don't like the way you dance. And I especially don't like the questions you're asking me! Thank you. - My pleasure. We . What did she say? Nothing. She said she didn't like the way I dance. I'm not surprised. And what else? Nothing. - Nothing! You didn't ask her, did you? Yes I did. - well then, what did she say? She said it wasn't my business. - There you are, at least something. A though it isn't much. What else? - Nothing. That's all. What a help! I thought you were cleverer than that. A little bit ... It was a bit of a failure . . . - Yes, it was. So good night, Gustav. - Wait. Where are you going? To Manicka. She'd be upset. Manicka's asleep. - No she isn't. Of course she is. Vyhlidka, we did it the wrong way. I should have know that she'd wriggle out of this, you know? I've got an idea. When they start to play again go for thelsecond one. What second one? You know, for her friend, you know the one. But I don't look around when I'm sitting with Manicka. That's good. I praise you. But Manicka isn't here now so there's no problem at a . Come here. She's sitting over there. In the red b ouse with that white collar, do you see? - Gustav, please . . . Don't ask! What a miner. And don't worry, she's nice, pleasant, polite. And while you're dancing, just mention it like that: That's a nice couple you're sitting with over there. Who are they? That must be a serious re ationship. And she'll tell you: Not at all, it's just a sort of affection. Her true ove is in Prague. We then we're home and dry. Why should I ask her if you know everything already? I don't know anything. She's got to tel us. And what if she doesn't? - So she' I te us something else. Don't make me angry. Go on, go on. Just as I told you, go on. Veruska was very soft on him. If he'd come up to me ... He might get confused and come a second time! May I ask you to dance? Excuse me, but I asked your friend here. I know, but you're going with me! Not to dance floor but outside. - We won't hear the music out there. Quiet! I'll give you music! Come on! Come on! please, don't be angry, please, let me explain . . . What do you want to explain? Is this behaviour for decent society? What I've done? - You're harassing the gir s. But l'm not ... - What a surprise, married man! But ... - You should be ashamed! Please, don't. - Where do you think you are? And here's thelsecond one. I didn't think he'd be far away. I beg your pardon . . . - Quiet! The gir s complained you were a ready watching them in the train. Is this the way you imagine to spend your holiday? How dare you! - I can dance if I want, can't I? You can, but what about that talk during the dance? Why should a married man be interested if a girl has a boyfriend or not? I'm sorry . . . - It's clear what you were after. Bohous! Manicka, it's not my fault. This is a Gustav's doing. You sneak. Mrs. Vyhlidkova . . . - Come here! Only those postcards ... - Come here! Better go on. Manicka . . . - You should be ashamed. I just danced, what's wrong? - What a shame. For God's sake! Madam, who gives you the right to cause dissension in families? Look at that poor man what trouble he's in because of you. At least next time he'll be more careful. And you be glad that I'm sorting it out just between us. Otherwise you'd pack your bags. I guarantee you that. Sonny, sonny. What do you say to the flat, Mrs. Angel ? The kitchen is small, but the bathroom is nice. And then there's the district heating. I'm a ready thinking that when they need a bigger flat they can move into ours. But there's enough time to think about that. And I'lldo it like this, studio flat in Nusle is OK for me. And here they are far enough so we don't disturb them, but close enough so we can come and visit them. What awful weather here and such a beautiful in the mountains. Vera wrote to me how it was pretty freezing there. I just hope Gustav doesn't get co d. Come in. Hel o, Gustav. What's up with you? I'm trave ling across Africa. Just have a look. But you can't trave being hungry. When are you coming to eat? When nobody's down there. What about Manicka. How did it turn out? Well, I had to tell her it was all your fault. Better said, because of your son. - Vyhlidka, you're such a prattler. That depends. She anyway doesn't believe me. Just don't spoil it. If she asks, tell her I invented it. Let her think I'm cunning. If you could see how she tends to me. She's so careful and jealous, Gustav. It's so nice. I'm frightened to stick my head outside, I'm afraid to meet somebody and you enjoy the situation. What sort of a person are you? But there's no shame. Don't let it spoil your holiday. Take your coat and come outside. Today there's a carneval. You know nothing being hidden here ike a gopher. You're right, Bohous, why should I let it ruin my holiday. You were leaving in an ambulance and back you trot onlyour own. You made a quick recovery. - That x-ray! Two important young doctors say: Your bone's fine, nothing's wrong. What if I get a jelly on my ankle? Je y? You're running around like a roebuck. Being angry I forgot about the pain. You even forgot to fake it. They said the same. But I'm not going to make it easy for them. When I get to Prague I'm going for a check-up. That leg's practically gone. For that I'll get at least two weeks. Two weeks? More than that. You deserve at least twenty-five. Hello, hello, we're opening the fancy-dress slalom for prizes. Those who go through the gates without a mistake can pluck off a camera, bottle of wine, bottle of gin to warm up, cigarettes, choco ate or other sweets, perhaps even toothpaste. We wish you big success in the race. Let's start. It's a big fun. I'd really like to try it as wel . What you mean, Gustav? Nothing. You'll break your neck. You need young legs for that. We're not good enough. Look how that boy can ski. Have a look, youth! Such a boy can ... Hey, sonny. Why are you getting in my way? Where did you learn to ski like that? At home in Beskydy. Any old woman knows how to ski there, even with one foot in the grave! What do you say, sonny? That old bloke made me upset. Did you hear? Any old woman. Those skiers! Sti I the lessons and the training ground. That old bloke from Ostrava a so thinks it's just a miracle. It's enough to go s owly, carefully, get the knack. And that's it. Gustav, Gustav, did you see that? I know how to stop. That's nothing. You should have been watching. I was skiing. Damn it! Don't come here, don't come here. You a ways touch me and then I go wrong direction. Don't come here. Wait, I'll help you. - I don't beg you! Come and try it over there. That's better place. I know it is. But just s ow y and don't go behind me! Don't follow me. Just on my own. Don't follow me, I tell you! I knew it would end up like this, those trees! But Vyhlidka just: Come over there, it's a quiet place. What a hell! But I knew it, just my luck! What's happened to you? - Nothing! I'll help you. You don't need to help me. Don't waste your time. What's happened? Nothing's happened. Are you sti I here? Go on! You see I'm just relaxing by the tree. What are you waiting for? well, if you like it. - It's my concern whether I like it. You better look after that girl. She's waiting for. That's not a bad idea. It's like that? - Yes, it's like that! What a shame, young gir ! Whooooah! Heeeey! Hello, he lo, comrades, those of you who applied for the cable car trip to Lomnicky Peak, take your tickets at reception desk. Did you hear? And you wanted to go home. Right. I'm packing and leaving. When does the train go? But Gustav . . . sorry . . . Where would you go? Tomorrow we a leave anyway. You don't wish to pay yourself, do you? I wouldn't want. By the way, it doesn't matter whether I talk to son today or tomorrow. It won't change anything. So you may go for a trip. Your ticket is prepaid anyway. Exactly. - Good morning. Here you are. Thank you again. - You didn't forget? No. - well, thank you. I thank you. - And I thank you. What is it you s op over so suddenly? Can't I behave decently to decent people? Of course, you can. So, are you going? Yes. After all, don't I have a prepaid ticket? To Tatranska Lomnice? Thank you. Come on, come on! - All right, all right. Come on, come on! - All right, all right. Hurry up, sonny. Enough. It's fu I. Wait for another cabin. That's something, isn't it? - It's beautifu . It is. And once we're at the top we'll really have a view, won't we? Welcome! Hello. It's dark, isn't it? We left at midday and somehow arrived in the evening. That happens here. - Can we look outside? Go ahead, but it's misty. - That doesn't matter. Come on. Be my guest. If you're interested, those are the Zdiar Forks. And here are the Tatra crests as far as Kralova Hola. This way is Zanzibar, and that one is Kilimanjaro. Let someone tell me I'm wrong. It's like being inside a laundry here. Bad luck, comrades. The clouds have come. So let's wait unti they go away. It might take half an hour or a week. But you can wait. Oh yes, no hurry. We can wait. You hear that. Some new people have arrived. You have to go down. Why do you bring them here if there's nothing to see? Maybe the clouds will I part. Let's wait and see, now that we're here. I can see mist back home in Brno. I didn't have to come here. I'll wait here with you. I've got enough time. You can wait, but I warn you it's at your own risk. What sort of risk? Don't worry. It's just that people who've just come will go down first. There might be a high wind, the cable car won't run. That happens. Goodbye, comrades, goodbye. - will I you stay here? Welcome, welcome. Bohous, you must play for me more often. Do I? - Of course, if you want to. If I feel to like it, I will. My dear, you shouldn't have let that perfumed countess in the fur coat go before you. You could have been out of here a long time ago. But she was afraid up here. - What? Unfortunately, the cable car isn't running due to the high wind. That's fine. What are we going to do? Nothing. Wait until it passes. It's easy to say let's wait. Here! Two and a half thousand metres up. That's nothing. Once we were buried five hundred metres be ow the ground and it was worse. And we got out of that as well. Here you've got fresh air, warmth, ight. What more you wish? Comrades, please write down your names and which hote you stay. I have to report down for case they're looking for you. We're all from the 'Morava'. A pencil like this, my dear. I'd only break it. My hands are used to a pneumatic drill . You know what? Write Josef Maruscak and it's done. Maruscak? - That's right. And you? - May I? No need to trouble you. Thank you. Excuse me, here you are. - Thank you. Attention please. The cable car manager has informed us that comrades Angel , Maruscak and Matouskova have been forced to stay at the Lomnicky Peak due to bad weather. We're informing their roommates so they don't worry about them. Wait here, I'll get her. She won't believe it. Is Vera there? - They just announced she's up there. Wait, Veruska, not in the bedroom. At Lomnicky Peak. She can't get down. You seem to be a little sad, my dear. I am only expecting my... - Your boyfriend. And where is he? I've been looking forward all week, now he's come and I'm stuck up here. Just don't worry and no crying. If he loves you then he won't mind waiting for you, you know? I hope he won't wait too long. Last year we froze up here for three weeks. What? For three weeks? - What could we do? It's nothing for you. This is your job to be here. But I have to start my work on Monday again. Am I any Eskimo to spend the whole winter here? What you mean? Last year I didn't have an hour of absence, and now in January I should prolong my holiday by three weeks? That'd be a fine start to the year! And what about home? My wife and son? You can send them a message. Call the hotel. There's the telephone. That's a good idea. And what should I tell them? When will Welcome down? How should I know? It depends on the weather. That's great. A definite time, that makes a person a lot calmer. What are you doing here? - Hello. I'm here on holiday. Realy? This year there was such a strict selection. And now the entertainment officer himself is in the Tatras. What to do if there was one voucher left over? I couldn't waste it. So you troubled yourself of coming here, isn't that right? Of course, what else to do? You won't succeed next time again, Pulecek. Mr. Pulecek! I'm not just Pulecek to you. Right. For us you're a real dog in the manger. Look, Gustav has got a registered etter. The Hotel Morava. Yes, I'll call him, I'll call him. Probably his wife. - Telephone cal for comrade Vyhlidka. Hold on, don't shout. I'm here. - Take it in the booth. Thank you. Come soon. Can I make a call to Lomnicky Peak? Right now a call was connected. The first booth. Hold on, just a while. He wants me to read it to him. May I have the registered letter for Mr. Angel ? please don't hang up. I'd like to talk with someone up there. Yes, all right. OK, kisses, regards, we know that. What's next? Get to the point. What? Flat? What flat? Wait. Read it again, slowly. My dear wife has gone mad or so. What flat? Nevermind. The rest doesn't interest me. Take a pen and paper. No, don't go anywhere, just write on the other side of letter. Write: Eliska Angel, as the address, exactly, same as written. Write this: I've discovered serious problems. What? Yes, serious problems. It seems there won't be any wedding, to talk about a flat is premature. Don't write 'it seems', delete it. It's definitely premature. You better delete everything, it isn't a telegram, it's more like a novel. Write briefly and to the point. Telegram: No flat, full stop, no wedding, full stop, Gustav. Wait, don't write Gustav yet. Add this: I'llbe back when weather permits. Then comes Gustav. Understand? A right, read it back to me. What do you say? When weather permits then comes Gustav. That's absurd. I meant at the end comes the signature Gustav. When weather permits Gustav will come back, full stop. Got it? What don't you understand? It doesn't matter if you do or not. The main is Eliska will understand. That's important. And send it immediately. Straight away. Thanks Vyhlidka, thank you. Just a moment. Who did you want to talk to? - To Vera Matouskova, please. please, could you ca Vera Matouskova to the phone? Someone wants to talk to her. Yes, of course. Here you are. Thanks, thank you very much. I just hope to make head or tail of this. I couldn't wait. No, now I feel like I'm in heaven again. I'm high in the clouds and even speaking to an Angel . Mirek, is your father's name Gustav? Don't go away. Mr. Angel, are you from Prague - Nusle? I am, why? - Someone wants to talk to you. That'll be that crazy Vyhlidka. Thank you. What's wrong? I told you to send it immediate y. What? Stop pulling my leg. This is Angel speaking too. Who, what? Oh, Mirek. Yes, of course. I recognised you as soon as you spoke. What am I doing here? I'm stuck and can't get down. And what are you doing down there? So, you came for her. Right. Be careful. Next to her there is smart- looking young fellow, she called him Zdenek, you know? What? It's not a prob em? What a surprise. What do you mean? What Vera up here and Vera down there? What? Damn it, that's . . . Don't! You don't try it on! Don't think you can ... I'll send her, but it's not the way you may talk to your father. Just wait until I get down there. Yes, yes. He wants to have another word with you, so ... Where did you go, sonny? - Fresh air. I felt a bit faint. And my fur cap has gone. What a cap it was! Don't be upset and have a drop of this. Oh no, thank you. No offence, but I don't like sweet drinks. Let's do it this way. Bring us a bottle of wine and three glasses, will you? Certainly. No, hang on. Two bottles and four glasses. That's better. Certainly. So, come in, Veruska, come on. Let's have a little talk. We've enough time and peace for it today. Perhaps not a peace. But more than enough time. Sit down here, that's right. I'llsit down over here. So you're not that one down there, you're one up here. The one our Mirek . . . Yes. - I'm glad you're that one, not the other one. I didn't like her much. I like you. I'm glad to hear it. Frankly, it doesn't matter if I like you. The main is our son likes you. But he's still got a problem with me. Why? Mirek is . . . - I know, he knows what's right and proper. Like when it's a name day or Christmas. Like this scarf here. He gave me this for Christmas. It's nice. - Nice, it just looks like. They sell anything to young man. It sratches like a cheese-grater. My throat is like a plucked goose. You know, I gave Mirek this scarf for St. Nicholas' day. Seriously? You know what? I really quite like it. It's fine, a very pretty design and very warm. It's real quality. It doesn't crease. And every wool scratches a bit. You just say it because you know it's from me. Vera, let the thunder knock me down if I don't like that scarf. A person might worry about opening his mouth. Anyway, cheers. So, cheers, Veruska! Vera! - Mummy! Did you have a good time? At east help Vera with the skis. You carry that case like a prince. Who do you get that from? - Hello, Mummy. Gustav, dear, what happened down there? Just nothing. I'll tell you everything at home. Eliska, it was the best holiday I've ever had. I'd go there again next year. But they won't give me another winter holiday. You' see, they'll force me to go somewhere in July. But I'll get back there. What about you. How you were? What have you got on your head? - Oh yes. Vera lent me that. Where did you leave your furl cap? - Oh, it paid hardly for.
