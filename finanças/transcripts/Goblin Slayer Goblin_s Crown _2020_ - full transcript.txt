They went your way! Leave it to me! Great job, ladies! Oh, whoopsie. Come, now, pay attention. Hey, Wizard! I know. May I ask for this dance, milady? But of course. Sagitta... Tonitrus... ...quelta... ...oriens... ...raedius! ...iacta! I guess that about does it. You probably shouldn't let your guard down. I'm not. Even though we may face goblins... Nay. It's because we get to face goblins that adventures are worth going on. Fear not. I have a brilliant plan! Dear Goblin Slayer, I have a request for you. Our tale begins with a noble's daughter who left home to become an adventurer. She departed after accepting a quest and hasn't been heard from since. Her parents requested that the guild find her. This isn't a rare occurrence. The problem is that the quest the noble girl has undertaken involves slaying goblins. O merciful Earth Mother, please bless us, the wanderers in the darkness, with holy light! The guild came to me for help, but you were the only one I could make this request of. Please consider lending a helping hand to that poor girl. I pray from the bottom of my heart that you return safely. Best regards. Great job with the Holy Light back there. Huh? U-Um, I... Thank you very much. First there were two, then seven, and this makes nine. Altogether, that's twelve. I don't like how they gathered all the hostages in one spot. I also don't like how the bodies of the dead villagers are intact. Do you think there's another ogre? I'm not sure. Ow... Damn it... What's going on? Talk about slow. You used Stupor to put even the hostages to sleep? Their stench is wretched. How many bodies? I counted four. Sir Mage had three, so our total is seven. So altogether, we have nineteen. I thought I counted twenty at first. Are you the mayor? Y-Yes. We're adventurers. What? Adventurers? A silver rank? Could you be... The Goblin Slayer? Thank you for coming! Do you have an herbalist in your village? A priest would also do, so long as they can perform a miracle. The only priests around here are the traveling priests that pass through. We do have an herbalist, but... All right. We'll help tend to the wounded. We don't have many potions ourselves, so you'll have to settle with miracles and first aid. Orcbolg! So there were twenty. You little... You're not getting away! Use this. What's with that arrow? The tip was all loose. I modified it to be like that. What? I'll explain later. We'd like to stay at your inn for the night. Also, we'd like information on any adventurers who came here before us. And if you have one, we'd like a map of the mountains. That's fine, but as for payment... The goblins are more important. Once we get some rest, we're going after them. This is so nice and warm. Looks like you're still growing. Stare... Not fair. Eek! What are you talking about? What are you... E-Everyone else should've joined us. Well, we've got "The best medicine is alcohol!" And "Dirt suits me much better." And as for Orcbolg... He's keeping watch. If you don't make a move, he's going to be that way right up until the end. Though we did get to come this far north because of that, so I guess I don't mind. Um... Did you leave your forest because you got bored? You're half right and half wrong. I mean, I had a duty and felt fulfilled doing it... But one day, I saw a leaf being carried downstream. I wonder how far it'd go, and then I just never looked back. I chased after the leaf, ran through the trees, and before I knew it, I was outside the forest. I jumped across the rocks in the dry riverbed... What did you find? A dike. One that the humans had made. I'd never seen one before, but I thought it was pretty interesting. That's where the leaf had stopped. Say, humans die after living for about a hundred years, right? Well... I wonder why you guys can't live longer. Maybe I'd understand if I was human, too. And if you were born human, you'd wish you were as beautiful as the elves. And if you were born an elf, you'd wish you were born human. I guess you never truly get what you want in this world. Apparently, the adventurers you were sent on a rescue mission for hoarded all the food. And they refused to slay any goblins if the villagers didn't give them food. That's basically a threat... Then again, it's possible they needed the food. Did they need it? Pursuits can last a while sometimes. Well, we don't have that much time on our hands. We don't know what it's like in that nest or how many goblins there are. There's a chance that the adventurers are still alive. It is possible. Apparently, the last time they were seen, they looked quite weakened. If goblins were going to have a nest, it'd be here. I wonder why they didn't go back underground immediately. So, wood and food... Which means... Yeah. They're trying to starve them out. Orcbolg, why did you give me an arrow like that? When you shoot that arrow, the tip comes off, leaving only the shaft. So? The steel was poisoned. Unless they dig it out of their body, once they get back to their nest, their flesh will rot, spreading the sickness. It won't take care of all of them at once, but it'll be a huge blow. I still can't fathom what goes through that head of yours. I-It's so cold! Dusk is approaching. Once we've warmed up, we're going under. I never knew a place this cold even existed. Come on, drink! It'll warm you up! Come to think of it, isn't it your goal to become a dragon? Indeed. I know! Once you become an immortal dragon, I'll come visit you. It'll probably take about a thousand years, yeah? You can't imagine how boring that is. You won't be able to bear it without any friends. I see... A dragon that talks about his adventures slaying goblins... A dragon that's visited by an elf... And a dragon that loves cheese, right? Not bad at all. Right? In any case, let us first concentrate on the matter before us. Careful. There are spears in there. Wow, talk about malicious. Goblins are capable of laying such traps? Who knows? I don't see any totems. Perhaps they don't have a shaman. I'm not sure, but I don't like it. They were capable enough to attack that village and dispose of the adventurers that came before us. There must be some among them with brains. We'll strike from the right! O merciful Earth Mother, please bless us, the wanderers in the darkness, with holy light! Holy Light! Seventeen. No hob, no spellcaster, but they have arrows. Let's go. Here we go! First one's mine! Time to work, you gnomes! Roll grains of sand together, and it shall become rock! This is going well, Beard-cutter and Scaly! Indeed. Got it. Ten! Eleven! Thirteen! The enemies will pick themselves back up soon. Right! O merciful Earth Mother, please bless us, the wanderers in the darkness, with holy light! Seventeen. You okay there, long-ears? Ow... Sorry. I messed up. I'll heal you right away. Is there poison? Here. Let us remove the arrow first. Stay still, okay? What's the matter? The shaft... Where's the tip? Still inside. They actually learned? Does it hurt? I-I'm totally fine. Do you think there was poison? I don't think so... but... I'll do it. Get me some fire. Huh? You got it. Huh?! Dance, dance, salamanders. Let us borrow some flames from your fiery tails. Bite down on this. I'm going to gouge out the tip. N-No way! Well, most of that leg is gonna rot off, then. And once that happens, we won't be able to reattach it. Could you at least try to make it hurt as little as possible? I'll do my best. Seriously, don't make it hurt, okay?! I can't guarantee that, but I'll do my best. It's still throbbing. A-Are you all right? I think so. Can you shoot arrows? Of course I can. Then let us all proceed. She's still breathing. Looks like mission complete... Right? This is a shrine, isn't it? I wonder if a priest from the evil sect was here. Um, this... That's awful. It doesn't appear to be a goblin totem. I believe it's the green moon. It's the sign of a god. The deity of external knowledge, the God of Wisdom. The green moon? You mean where the goblins come from? Would they heal the goblins with miracles and teach them to use them? The God of Wisdom is a rather eccentric god, but... Perhaps it was a dark elf or a high-ranking priest of the evil sect. What? I don't think so. If you control a bunch of goblins, but you only use them for looting, doesn't that make you as dumb as the goblins? So it thinks like the goblins, leads the goblins, heals the goblins, attacks people, and is a follower of evil. A priest? It couldn't be... A goblin paladin. The reason the goblins attack the villages is because they're low on food. If we just wait here a few days, I'm sure they'll get impatient and come jumping out. Way to go, Sis. Well, if that's all it takes, that'll be great. We'll be in trouble if we get hit by a blizzard, though. What do you think, spellcaster? I'll do whatever she wants. She's our leader, after all. It's just as I thought. It's just a matter of time. It doesn't look like they're coming out today. Maybe they've got their guard up now. I'm sure they'll come out at any moment. They're goblins, after all. Sorry, Sis. I'll be right back. That's what you get for eating snow. We don't have much firewood left to continue melting the snow. We need to think of something. Let's keep watch a little longer. I'm sure the goblins are suffering right about now. We'll follow your orders. You're our leader. You can't possibly be suggesting that we flee without even fighting the goblins! As tired as we are right now, they might just overpower us. We don't have much food or firewood left. You're content with having people laugh at us for being the adventurers who ran from some goblins? That's all I could get today. How about this? One of us could go down to the nearby village to get supplies and food. But who would go? You go. I'm the only one doing any work around here lately. I'm done with this crap. Agreed. To be honest, I never liked this plan anyway. Very well. I agree that's the most logical option. Ah, lady adventurer, you're back. How are things going? Well, I... We're still working on it. My stars. I was wondering if you could spare us some food... How did things end up like this? Why are the goblins giving us so much trouble? Those stupid goblins... G-Goblins? It won't come out... My sword won't come out! No... S-Stop! Stop... No! Where are the others? Dead. I see. I want to ask you something. Just answer as well as you can. Do you mind? What did you do? We were trying to starve them out. I thought it would work. I see. We would all work together, raise our ranks, and... I thought it would all work out. I see. I guess things like that happen. Hey, wait. What? Are you Goblin Slayer? That's what they call me. Ow... Goblin Slayer... How's your wound? I'm fine. It still hurts a little, but it's been treated. I see. So you mentioned a God of Wisdom back in that cave, right? What's his deal? The God of Wisdom is the deity of external knowledge. So he's a god of knowledge? The God of Knowledge that we believe in has dominion over intelligence, reason, and the truths of this world, and guides those who wish to know the unknown. The God of Knowledge believes that the suffering and frustration experienced on the path to gaining knowledge are important, but the God of Wisdom gives knowledge indiscriminately to one and all. As a result, ways to destroy this world are created, and the God of Wisdom is not interested in how many innocent lives are lost in the process. Now my head is starting to hurt in addition to my leg. Whatever the reason, the problem is goblins. Their lair must be elsewhere. It seems there are some ruins higher up here. What sort of ruins? A dwarf fortress. Ah, the dwarves' fortress from the Age of the Gods... It's not going to be easy to get in there from the front. You got any good ideas? I just thought of one. I'll go, too. You can't. We came here on a request from your parents to save you. You should head home and talk to them first. I have to get it back. Get what back, if I may ask? Everything... Everything that I've lost. A dragon only has honor when it is a true dragon. A dragon without honor is no dragon. H-Hey, what if she dies?! Well, you might die, too. Even we might die. All living creatures eventually die. You elves know that better than anyone. Well, yeah, but... We should take her with us. Otherwise... I am neither your parent nor your friend. If you have a request, you know what you need to do. I know that. I'll get the reward money and pay you up front. And I'll also come with you. What can you do? I know the way of the sword, and I can cast lightning spells. Very well. You don't have any objections, do you? As long as you're okay with it, Orcbolg. Then let's go slay some goblins. I don't agree with this! Why are we being treated like we're battle trophies? The rest of us wouldn't be convincing. Do you hear those fools yapping, Sir Bishop? They will eventually become offerings to the God of External Knowledge. Let them do as they please for now. Um... Are you cold? I'm fine. Well, I'm cold, so I'm going to get a bit closer. Do as you please. Hey, I guess you aren't completely dense. Thank you very much. I planned to give these to you when we reached the fortress, but these rings have breathing spells sealed within them. Rings that allow us to breathe underwater? That should help with the cold a little. You should've given these to us earlier! These are amazing. Right? Here. You should use it, too. I don't need it. I'm not cold. Yes, of course. Now you can't run away. I am the Bishop of the Green Moon, a humble servant of the God of External Knowledge! Open these doors! Don't worry. We're all here with you. Here they come. Is that the goblin paladin? No. I would like to request an audience with the master of this fortress, the noble paladin. Yes, I bring offerings. Please throw them in a cell and cut off their hands and feet so they cannot run away. Are they actually communicating? Apparently, it's the miracle of telepathic communication. Ah, so we shall begin with this girl. Are you okay? Are you hurt? Calm down! Why, you... Well, I did expect this... Hey, give it a rest already! Goblins need to die! Oh, for crying out loud! This was to be expected. It's better we keep an eye on her if she's going to be reckless. Yeah, but... P-Please, calm down. You should be angrier than anyone else right now. Calm down. Take care of your wound first, then heal her. Her hand will rot. And it'll leave a scar. Right. There were survivors among the hostages. Go check on them. Right. I'm not sure if I'm up to the task alone. Come along, Scaly. Well, spellcasters are known to be physically weak. Let's go. I understand how you feel, but it might be better to hold off until later. Why did you bring that girl? Because we need her. We need her? Now that we've attempted this, there's only winning or losing. That's not what I'm talking about here. I know. At least, I believe I do. Get ready. Sorry. I lost my temper. It happens. To you, to her, and to me. Even you? Yes. I can't picture it. Is that so? Yes. I see. Will the hostages be all right? This is probably safer than taking them with us. What's that sword made of? Aluminum. The blade was forged from a red gem and tempered with lightning. Mind letting me have a closer look? So, where are we headed? We should head to their armory first. But before we do that, how many spells and miracles do we have left? Um... I have three remaining, and the other two have four and three... So we have a total of ten. We forgot to include the girlie over there. Two. So we have twelve remaining altogether. No, we should save our two lightning spells if we can. We'll be able to kill the goblins? Yes, if all goes well. Well, we're counting on you. All right. Why did you give her the torch? I think it must hurt to be left not carrying anything. Didn't you notice? She seemed a bit bashful when I gave her the torch. This seems a bit different for an armory. Well, this is a dwarf fortress, so we might find some ore deposits. But would the goblins actually reinforce their blades? Regardless, leave this to me. Hey, girlie. Help me out. We're going to carry some of this out of here. Beard-cutter is a master at destroying weapons. I believe I'm using them effectively. You're not going to get very far with just a short sword. Guess we should see what kinds of swords they have. I don't need any other sword. So you don't want an actual sword. Very well. This is how relationships begin. What good would it do if you couldn't speak your mind? Well, are we ready? Go for it. O great ancestors who sleep within the great whiting... Take these things with you through the burden of time. Is that a prayer for decay? Indeed. Now we have the prisoners from their dungeon as well as their weapons. All according to plan. Yeah. We messed up. This is a goblin coronation ceremony. And a coronation ceremony needs a priest... a cleric to conduct the ceremony. Well, he's sort of dead in the dungeon. Wh-What's wrong? O merciful Earth Mother, please lay your revered hand upon this child's wounds! Get down! Are you all right? Y-Yes. At least they tried. How are you doing over there? We're surviving. Let's split up. I'll act as the decoy. My physical strength will be optimal to carry the prisoners out. I will take up that task. All right, let's go. All right. Don't. I know... I know... I know. But this isn't... Why do they get to... laugh and do whatever... It's all my fault again. This all happened because of me... Because of... I need my sword back! I need it... Give it back... Give it back! I want to go home! Father, Mother... I'm through with... I see. All right. Huh? I'll retrieve your sword. I'll kill the paladin. I'll kill the goblins. I don't mean just one or two. I don't mean just a single nest, or all the ones in this fortress. I'm going to slaughter all of the goblins. So stop crying. O merciful Earth Mother, please bless us, the wanderers in the darkness, with holy light! Let's go. Keep your head down. O-Okay. Should I cast Protection? I'll leave that to you. Okay. I'm leaving the rear to you. All right. It'll be okay. That's one. And two. Three. They're coming from behind! How many? I'm not sure, but a lot! All right. I can't keep up... Ugh! Why are there always so many of you? Take that! Thirteen. Well done. I wonder if they're doing okay up there. What? You worried about Beard-cutter? I'm not worried about Orcbolg. I'm worried about my two friends up there. You got a problem with that? Well, you're an elf. I guess you're partial to this friendship business. Throughout the ages, when trying to conquer a castle, flooding it has been standard, but starving the enemy out is also a worthy option. All right. Pull! Twenty-nine. We're making good time. Let's fall back. Get ready. Goblin Slayer! Took you long enough. Do it. I'll buy us some time. All right. Okay... Tortrus... O merciful Earth Mother, oriens... please provide us protection... Iacta! Take that! We're ready! Never forget your adventurer tools when heading out for adventure, I guess. Where are the others? I'm so sick of those goblins and their stupid holes. You're telling me... Right on time. We are safe. Thank goodness. Everything good on your end? Yes, we're fine. We did it. Yes. Beard-cutter, what happened to your sword? I threw it. Some things never change. Thanks. Nothing beats the feeling of being able to shoot as many arrows as I want! Could you not say such scary things? My apologies. I'll take care of the rear. Back me up. You got it! Gnomes! Undines! Make me the finest cushion I'll ever see! Who do you goblins think you are? Move! Ugh! There are fewer now. I'll take over. Go. Eight, nine. We can't just descend to the village like this. There was a valley, wasn't there? It's not far from here. Then we'll go there. Here, Beard-cutter! Thanks. Thirteen. Right, what's next? Give me a shovel! You got it! My apologies... Nineteen. Twenty. Go on ahead. I'll crush them here. Can you handle it? Of course I can. That was the last of the weapons. Then I shall lend you mine. Leave the backup to me. My spells are about to run dry. Goblin Slayer... Save your miracles. I will. I know you're counting on me. I have a plan. Right. Fire when I give the signal. All right. He learned. You rude little bastards! In that case... You fell for it. Goblins are not bright creatures, but they aren't complete fools. However... you are a fool! Fire! Tonitrus... oriens... iacta! I have a bad feeling about this... Oh, damn it! O merciful Earth Mother, please protect us, the weak, with the powers of the earth. Protection! Goblin Slayer! Where is he? Where's Goblin Slayer? Probably toward the bottom, if he was carried away by the snow. Probably. It's probably better if we don't talk too loudly just yet. We should walk over to find him. Aren't you worried about him? Of course we are. He is our comrade, after all. But, you know... He is Goblin Slayer, after all. I messed up. I should've prepared for the impact rather than the lack of air. G-Goblin... Slayer? Are you all right? We should be asking you that. I thought it was weird. There's no way Orcbolg would give us these rings to breathe underwater for no reason. Were you planning this from the start? To an extent. It would've been nice of you to explain that. Don't be foolish. What if the enemy heard our strategy and tried to thwart us? Yes, but you just make us worry when you don't tell us what's going on. I've got plenty to say to you, but this is definitely how an adventure should be. Adventure... I see... So this was an adventure. Hey. I found it. I managed to get the sword, but the scabbard was washed away. I guess the avalanche was a failure. You sure cry a lot. We somehow survived another year. Let us praise the Gods of Fate and Chance, and of Order and Chaos! Cheers! Happy New Year! I worked real hard last year. I... guess. I swung my spear around and killed some monsters. So that goblin-killing guy is no match for me. Yes, yes... You worked hard... Yes, you did. So what're you gonna do now? I'm planning to go see my parents and have a long chat with them. I'd like to make graves for my fallen comrades, as well. I'll decide my path after that. Yeah, that sounds like a plan. You always need to take care of your friends and family. Sweet nectar of the gods! Sir Goblin Slayer should've joined us. No kidding. I never get a chance to drink with ol' Beard-cutter. Not all encounters end up favorable, but one should still cherish fate. I, um... I'll make sure to write. Yes. Please feel free to write us about anything at any time. I'll make sure to send you plenty of replies. Yes. I'll make sure to write lots and lots. Ooh, me too! I've always wanted to write a letter to a friend. Maybe I'll write some letters, too. I rarely get to meet girls my age since I work at a farm. Working at a guild isn't much better. By the way, where's Goblin Slayer? Do you not want to share your childhood friend with the rest of us? I'd be lying if I said I wanted to share him... But I guess I'm feeling kind of generous this year. Indeed. You should always play fair. You can come over. Do you keep watch like this every year? Don't ask stupid questions. R-Right... They always try to attack on New Year's. Here. They wanted me to bring this to you. I see. You even set up camp out here. I spent ten years of my life slaying goblins. But it can't be said that goblins don't evolve. Do you know what the goblin paladin was plotting? No... Metal refining. That can't be... The dwarf fortress... Mining tools... And that girl's aluminum sword... Ore that was forged with lightning. There's only one possible conclusion. I need to do whatever I can against them. I can't let my guard down. Honestly... All you ever talk about is goblins, every time you open your mouth. I bet slaying goblins is more important to you than hanging out with your friends. No. See? I knew it... I don't like big, noisy crowds, but I don't mind when everyone is having fun. It's always better to have someone watching your back. It's cold out here. I'm aware of that. I see. Now that that's settled, let's have some dinner and do our best until morning. I see. Oh, I forgot to mention... What is it? I hope you'll continue to help me out this year, as well.
