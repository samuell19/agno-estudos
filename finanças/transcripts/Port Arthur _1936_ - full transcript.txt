February 1904 Yes? Oh, it's you. - Ready for the grand folly? Don't joke, Novitzki. - What's got your goat? What you're worrying about may never happen. Boris, a lieutenant in the imperial Russian navy has the world at his feet. Yes, commander. Lieutenant! They're here! Go and inform the commander. Move it. It's too late for second thoughts. Everything ready? Ready in 5 minutes. - Very good. Dimitri on duty in front of Boris's door, and the officers here? - Yes, sir. Let's keep it simple. It's an intimate gathering. Thank you. Is everything in order? - Yes. Let's get on with it then. Attention, full speed ahead. You're emotional, darling. Nothing tragic's going to happen to you. We're departing? Merely to exit the territorial waters. It's only when we're 3 miles off the coast that Commander Novitzki can render us this service. Oh, I see. Tell me, was it difficult leaving home this morning? No, but when Ivamoura discovers the truth, he's going to loathe me. There was no alternative, Youki. He's been giving me the runaround with his politeness. We had to do it this way, otherwise he'd have arranged your marriage with Kefouki-san and... I couldn't live without you. Me neither, Boris. Then we're made for each other. I will be most correct. I'll find Captain Ivamoura so he doesn't learn about this from a third party. Yes? The commander is waiting for you. My dear Youki, I can't find the words to express my happiness seeing you aboard our Retsvi on this day when you will agree to our friend Boris being by your side for always. A beautiful and ancient custom permits the commander of a warship to celebrate a marriage. Everything will be done to his satisfaction. Our friend Kefouki-san has nothing to concern himself about. Youki will obey her brother as she has done since our mother disappeared. Any news? No, Captain Ivamoura. Still nothing. The Japanese in Port Arthur know? Most of our people have already embarked. The Russians haven't noticed anything? Nothing in the slightest. - Hurry them along, next door. The consulate must be able to evacuate at a moment's notice. Warn my sister. - Yes, Captain Ivamoura. There's something my friend Kefouki-san needs to remember... When my mother was made a widow by that Russian gentleman she brought back to Japan this little daughter. My sister Youki is only half Japanese. Since you want me to, I can talk to her about you. To the health of the 3rd and the delightful little Japanese who's throwing her lot in with an officer of the Russian navy. It would be even nicer to recall that your father was Russian. So, Youki, happy now? What a fine friendship all these men have for you. Yes. Go back home, and I'll see your brother at the consulate. We'll be in Port Arthur soon? This is it this time. Are you certain there's nothing else needs doing? Absolutely certain. Everybody to the boat. Say hello to Japan for me. My clothes and my linen, the strict essentials. Is my sister ready? Youki! What? Aren't you yet ready? I have to talk to you. You can talk on the boat. I'm not going on the boat. What's this you're saying? I'd like you to leave. They didn't transmit my order? I thought my brother knew. - Knew what? Haven't you seen Lt Ranewsky? - Why these questions? We must quit Port Arthur immediately. I can't quit Port Arthur. The long-anticipated war is about to break out. I only understand that it's abominable. Youki, this isn't the time for sentimentality. Since my brother and my husband are going to be at war, I don't think this is sentimentality. Your husband? Lt Ranewsky is your husband? For the last two hours. Very well. In that case, you've separated yourself from us. Ivamoura! Ivamoura! You are no longer the sister of Captain Ivamoura. More importantly, you're no longer Japanese. Captain Ivamoura. Pass. Next. Come on, you porters! Hurry! Disembark! Disembark! Commander Novitzki. - Show him in. Here's the report, general. - Thank you. The reports from the head of counter-espionage Wossidlow confirm the Japanese have mobilised. Directed against us? - Definitely. Their most recent manoeuvres prove it. This information is exaggerated. They'd never dare. It would be national suicide. Torpedo 1, fire! Torpedo 2, fire! Torpedo 3, fire! Before declaring war, the Japanese sank three battleships. The Japanese have cut our communications with the army of the north. The order is given to fall back to Mukden. In these circumstances, we must give up our defense of Port Arthur. Inform urgently the commander of Port Arthur that the city is encircled... and that he will have to resist the bulk of the Japanese army alone. To sum up, gentlemen... After our abandonment of the higher ground, the enemy has completely surrounded Port Arthur. We must at all costs hold this position to assist the army of Manchuria. I consider this encampment to be impregnable. It is our resistance that will decide the outcome of this war. Thank you, gentlemen. The crews are at the disposal of the land army. - Very good. We've identified the naval ordnance we can utilise. The linchpin of our defense is Fort No. II. I've drawn up a plan for the defense of this position, the command of which will be entrusted to Lt Vassidloff and to Lt Ranewsky. Novitzki and his officers need to be informed. Very well, general. A carrier pigeon. Is it one of ours? I'd be surprised, given its direction. It must be carrying a Japanese message to one of their spies in the city. That would interest us, commander Wossidlow. A Japanese message. Send this to my office immediately. Close the ranks. Lieutenant Ranewsky. Cdr Novitzki will give you the defense plans that you need. - Yes sir. Happy to be ashore? - Very happy. But I'd like to be a bit further ashore. In an hour, you'll be in the city. You'll see your Youki. - Thank you. Is everything okay? - Yes but I am still a sailor. I think of our torpedo boat. Where's this message? - In my shirt. Take it off. Orderly. Take this to the laboratory for H-37 treatment. This shirt is to be treated with formula H-37. Before crossing the lines, make yourself inconspicuous until it grows back. Five days' leave? - Yes, but in a cell. Come on. Next. Do you have the results for 418? No, commander. Shake a leg, pal. You, examine this for me. Don't dally. Have you translated the pigeon message? Yes, commander. Here. They're instructions for a spy. It's very important, we captured that pigeon. "Breakthrough of the Russian fleet expected. Find out the date. Signed H-12." An attempt on the blockade. They know more than we do. Send it to my office. Son of a bitch. How's our lodger? Still no sign of improvement? - It's still weak. However it is eating. - I need it to fly. Tomorrow, commander. - I need it to fly today. I am not the Good Lord. We could try an injection. Anything that you like, but I need it to fly. Give me an ampule, miss. Let's give this try. A coolie has come to take you to the gentleman. To the gentleman? Boris isn't wounded? The coolie says the gentleman is asking for you. He's through there. Where's my husband? - I'll take you. But where to? - Won't you follow me? Come on, come on. Madam. My husband is here? - You're awaited, Madam. Ivamoura... You're in Port Arthur? What are you doing here? You finally remembered how to behave in front of your older brother. I'm sorry, you won't find your husband here but rest reassured, you'll see him today. I'll see Boris today? How do you know this? My duties condemn me to the knowledge of many things. It was out of duty that I've had you come here. We need you. It's impossible. I know all your objections. They count for nothing in my book, when the lives of our soldiers are at stake. You must remember that, Youki. I mustn't do anything. Really? In that case, you must have me arrested. I'm begging you... for yourself, for us, don't try to see me again. Don't attach so much importance to our fate. We are merely corpses on leave. You will show that despite it all, you're one of us. Ivamoura, I'm Russian. No, Youki. Listen, we must talk. They're going to try to send to Vladivostok the remainder of their Port Arthur squadron. We need at least 6 hours' advance warning. No! - It's you who will alert us. No. I'm telling you no. - Yes. You'll alert us out of gratitude, because thanks to me you can prevent your husband boarding the Bravi and facing certain death. There's only one thing I want: to see you leave Port Arthur at once. If you give me the information, I can leave. Oh, no. It's abominable. Let me out of here! Youki! Youki, may I have one last word? If by some chance, my little sister who is now Russian, has a wicked notion, the police will certainly find Ivamoura here. Here's where the 270 from the Poltava should be located. It would command the Eagle's Nest. Yes, but there is still a blind spot, and we can't eliminate it. Yes, we've considered that. Our machine guns have it covered. Madam, sir is asking for you. Sir is here already? - Yes, with several officers. He's in session with them. Yes? Who's there? It's me, Youki. Boris. Youki. I'd forgotten... how lovely you are. Now that you're here, I'm not afraid of anything. Afraid? Why would you be afraid? Where have you been? I was waiting so long for you. I went to Novitzki's. I wanted to hear news of you. From Novitzki's? Notitzki, come here. I'm learning a lot: Youki has returned from your office. Sorry I wasn't there, Youki. Excuse me, even a confirmed bachelor like me understands that a young married couple need some alone time. May I briefly borrow your husband? Excuse us. I won't be two minutes. He looks better. He flies! Close the windows! Catch it then, come on. Come on, catch it! Are you ready? We're going to let it go. It has a black ribbon on the leg. There! There! The pigeon went in that house! Dismount! Storm that house! Search everything! Excellency! Order your soldiers to leave me in peace. My shop... I'm ruined. I'm a good friend of Russia. Look at this merchandise. Everything's wrecked. I'm begging you. These Japanese know how to die. We're agreed then. Study your plans, but keep them safe. Of course, commander. See you tomorrow morning, at headquarters. Ah, Youki, my friends wanted to say hello before leaving. See you tomorrow. Those 2 minutes turned out a trifle long. You've no more work to do? - No. Now I can dedicate myself to you alone. I should hope so. I've been waiting for my friends to leave who were keeping us apart. - My poor Youki. We haven't had much opportunity. - No, Boris. Is there any chance we can get a whole day to ourselves? Don't forget I'm in the military. When you're not here, I feel very alone, very threatened. - Have a little patience. Soon we'll be together al the time. You'll see. I know I shouldn't say such things to you. But how can I remain calm? I'm a wife now, Boris. I'm your wife. I don't want you upset. How can I not be upset? Here, Boris, in Port Arthur, I more than anyone else realise the madness of this war! Here, I see it all, I know it all! And I know you're in the middle of it, Boris, and I'm afraid! You're right. You're right, Youki. You need to hope that maybe one day mankind will understand, and that like you they will hate war enough to suppress it. Yes, you're right. Look at us. A few months ago, I didn't know you. And since I've known you, instead of being an enemy, you've become part of me. Exactly like my hands, like my eyes are part of me. As for me, Youki, I love you so much I no longer know what country you come from. What's new? The plans of the fort are in the safe. Here's the imprint of the key. I hope this imprint is good. I must have this key quickly. Move it, why don't you? You're up already? You were going to leave without waking me? It's very early, darling. You should sleep on. I have to go. You'll be back in the lines shortly? I really don't know. That could happen to me at any moment. Ah, yes. This is going to sound bizarre, but when you're fighting in a fort, obviously I'm alarmed, but I'd been even more alarmed if you went out with the fleet to break the blockade. To break the blockade? Where did you get that idea? You are a child. No, I'm not a child. If the fleet tries to break out, I'll be stranded all alone in Port Arthur, and I'll feel quite hopeless. I don't know where you got this idea. Don't dwell on such things. Yes, you're right I must be mad, asking all these questions. What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say... that I should be making you forget the terrible time you've just had. You're right. Right now, I'm here... thinking only of us. Politics don't interest me, commander. If the Russians win, great. If the Japanese win, fine. I don't concern myself with politics. I'm an honest trader. I sell goods. I want business to turn over. And you're not afraid to make special transactions? I don't understand what you mean. Enough. You're in the pay of the Japanese. We know this. If you want to avoid further trouble, tell me about them. I've told you everything I know, Excellency. You've told me everything? Then I can have you shot!... Come on, shoot this for me. - You can't do this, Excellency! I beg you. I have a family to support. I've 2 wives, 13 children. I'll tell you whatever you want. You're to take out the Poltava and the Bogatyr. Approach the enemy, but avoid all combat. Determine the number, the position, and the importance of the ships engaged. Very good, commander. According to information from our secret agents, the Japanese are tightening their blockade and our squadron will be trapped. Ivamoura hasn't quit Port Arthur. Yesterday, he spoke to the wife of a Russian officer. The wife of a Russian officer? - She's Japanese. Japanese? - Not totally. What's her name? - I don't know. Okay. Sit down. We're going to get along just fine. - I hope so, Excellency. Thank you, gentlemen. All the best. Why isn't it my torpedo boat being sent? The Retsvi is 5 knots faster than the Bogatyr, Just now, we're holding the Retsvi in reserve. Don't be jealous, Boris. Incidentally, your torpedo boat will remain here even if we can get the fleet out to Vladivostok. What did you just say? You want the fleet to get out? Of course. What's up? This is something else. I've already heard talk of this. - From whom? From Youki. From Youki? When? This morning. Impossible. How could she have heard about it? Yes, how? Yes? What is it, Wossidlow? You've some good news? I don't know if it's good. Do you have a cigarette? - Yes. Excuse me. Please. Thanks. Lieutenant, you'll be so kind as to follow me to my office. Yes, commander. I have your permission? - Yes. Strotsky! Did you give a proper welcome to the lady who visited yesterday? Which lady, commander? Mrs Ranewsky. - She didn't come here yesterday. Well, well... Give me those papers to sign. I hate asking you this, but the enemy I'm fighting inside Port Arthur is more formidable than the one outside. You must help me, gentlemen. I've decided to employ you marines that disembarked yesterday for a full-scale action on the whole city. We are at your service. - Thank you. In 20 minutes, each unit will receive a plan of operations. Very good, commander. Thank you, gentlemen. One moment, Ranewsky. Could you invite me to tea? Of course. Would your wife be there? Of course, commander. - Good. I'll be there no later than 6pm. Very well. These men work like lunatics. They've dismantled 2 105 guns and 3 86s. - We're going back to the lines. Please excuse me. So, what did Wossidlow want? He wants to talk to Youki. I'm not surprised. What does that mean? Yesterday, when she said she'd been to my office, she was lying. It can't be. Yes. It can't be. Where is Madam? - She should be there. Youki... I have to talk to you. What's the matter? You're alarming me. I'm alarmed too, when the head of counter-espionage interrogates me about you. About my wife. You were summoned by the head of counter-espionage? Youki, this morning you spoke to me about the fleet departing. Only General Stoessel knew of that plan. Who informed you about it? Nobody. You're lying. For the first time since I've known you, you're lying. I'm sure of it. I can see it. Boris, I've done nothing wrong. Where did you go yesterday? Come on, Youki, be sensible. Youki. You well know that I love you, and that I'm your only love. Show that you trust me. Yes, Boris. I did lie. Must I tell you the truth? - You must tell me. Where did you go yesterday afternoon? To Ivamoura. What? To Ivamoura. Where did you see him? Where? I need to know the exact place. Boris... - This is very serious. You must not hesitate. You must tell me this second who you belong to. To the enemy or to your husband? To you, as you well know. Then why didn't you admit to me at once that you'd been with a spy? I'd sworn I'd never see him again. He hates me now. All the same, Boris, we share the same mother, Ivamoura and I. He's the second human being that I loved. He taught me to smile. To walk. Life being what it is, I will always have these memories of him. You must understand, Boris. I couldn't turn him in. Unhappily, those memories don't matter now, Youki. You must forget them. Ivamoura is a spy. Even to you. Now you must tell me where he is. Grab them by their pony-tails. Those that scream are Chinese. Those whose pony-tail comes away in your hand: to prison. The Japanese were ready for this war. You'll easily find their spies by the pony tail they wear to make them look Chinese. Better to detain a thousand innocents than let one of the guilty go free. Are you Li Hung? You showed a woman to a spy. Don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything. I'm working for the Russians. - Really? I am an associate of Commander Wossidlow. This very evening, you'll see. - I see already. We're going to find every spy, especially the one I spoke of. I know this already. I've a score to settle with Ivamoura. Commander... - If you're smart, you'll have the other half. Li Hung is very smart. - We'll see. I'll come with you, sir. Commander Wossidlow. Show him in. I've arrived perhaps a little early. My husband is out. - She's charming, that kid. Where's she from? Not Korea, obviously. I don't know, shall I ask her? No, please. It doesn't matter. She seems nice, and given that at the moment your husband is forced to leave you alone a great deal, I thought that maybe you had befriended her. She'd be worth it, she seems intelligent. She's not lacking in spirit. - So you see that it's not so crazy to think you might have taken her as a confidante. When one has to live alone, one always needs a friend. Yes, but in Japan, where after all I was brought up, one doesn't take a servant as a confidante. Oh, well... I imagined, dear madam, that living here so far from any company, you may have compromised a little in that regard. That would be totally normal. Because apart from your husband, you've nobody here: you've no family, no husband, no brother. Here's maybe what you miss most: having a brother in Port Arthur. Would you like some tea, commander? - No, no. Allow me instead to take advantage of our solitude to ask a favour of you. - Gladly. Here, translate this for me. It's a Japanese text. I believe. Yes, it's a Japanese message. Then please, translate. "Attempted breakthrough by the Russian fleet..." Carry on. The light is so poor. - I'll make things clearer. "....of the Russian fleet imminent". "Find out the date..." Why have you stopped? - The writing's so small... Oh no! You know who this message is addressed to. You know it's addressed to your brother Ivamoura, who you went to meet yesterday in the teahouse of Li Hung. Good. Obviously you know what that meeting entailed? It was, simply put, a case of espionage. Listen carefully, madam. You bear a name that is glorious to us. Our comrade Ranewsky is one of our best officers. Now, as you've undoubtedly realised, the act you've committed requires that I bring you before a wartime tribunal and have you shot. I can't listen to you anymore. I must conclude my horrible mission. I think I've found a way to save your husband from dishonour. I've found this way by thinking of the proud and unwavering courage that your countrymen show. It's going to take all of that courage to take advantage of the opportunity I'm now offering you. I think that you will. I sincerely hope so for Ranewsky's sake. If this helps you, I swear to you that nobody except me will ever know what passed between us in this room. I've come directly from your office. I'm sorry I missed you there. I've something to tell you. - I'm listening. Your secretary is in possession of a denunciation written written by my wife against her brother. When did she write it? - Today. If you'd written this after seeing Ivamoura, we could have arrested him. Therefore I must ask why you waited until today. I only decided this afternoon to tell my husband everything. That was a big mistake, madam. It was a mistake, and I'm not going to ask any favour. If you consider my wife guilty... - Just one question. What's your opinion on this matter? My opinion doesn't count, I'm Youki's husband. Obviously, I'd be forgiving. So you think she's not guilty? I didn't say that, however, Commander, things being what they are, I must speak out for her. Halt! Captain Ivamoura? Shush. Careful Madam, can you swear to me that you've had no other contact with your brother? Yes, I can swear it. Good. I'm going to tell you something. I came here to save you from dishonour. And to bring this business to its only possible conclusion. For the first time in the service, I'm not going to follow reason... but my emotions. I hope that I am not also making a mistake. You can't know how much I'm in your debt. Oh, Boris. Right, forget about this. Forget everything that I asked of you. And consider what we've discussed here our little secret. Thank you, commander. Now, could we have that tea you offered? Ivamoura? What do you want? Shush! - You must go immediately. You have to hide me. - I can't. Only you can protect me - Shush. Darling? The commander's leaving. Be right there. The head of counter-espionage is here. Go to another room. Hurry. I'll be back. Their attempt to blockade the port failed, but... You think they'll try again. We must remain on our guard. Leave that alone - Get off me. I'll call Boris. Boris! Here, Youki. Coming. Don't let him in. Stop him, Youki. If I'm discovered, I'll kill him. This is too heavy for you. Madam, I'm causing you too much trouble. Not at all, commander. Cigarette? - No, thanks. Lemon? - That'd be nice. The lieutenant is here. Come in. They won't let me enjoy your hospitality. Commander, information from our source Li Hung. At 7.15, spies will gather in the ruined pagoda. Two companies are assembled and await your orders. - Thank you. I'm coming with you. Excuse me. We'll have their fleet. It's not getting out of Port Arthur. Admiral Togo has settled a score with the Bogatyr and the Poltava. What did you say? Good, very good. Excellent. Two Russian torpedo boats have just been sunk. The path to Vladivostok is now cut and the Russian fleet finds itself blockaded in Port Arthur. Make three copies of this and send them. It must get through! Make yourselves scarce! We're going to be raided. You, stay here. But what have I done? Captain Ivamoura. No! Halt! Take him alive! Captain Ivamoura. I should bow to your courage in adversity. However I can't bow to an officer who didn't hesitate to involve a woman, or rather a child, in a man's war. Why do you smile? I like to think we are of the same opinion, that we hold our existences to be of scant importance. That's right. The life you're so preoccupied with is worth even less. Because it's a woman's? - Yes. We do not see eye to eye. - Oh, no. Certainly not. The place where the mother, sister or spouse live, that's our Russia. This is why we're enemies. Enemies can still rend each other a great service? A service? - Yes. You could allow me to rejoin my ancestors. I can't do that. I know. However it wouldn't be very agreeable for me, or perhaps very convenient for an officer of the great Russian navy, if I was dragged in front of a wartime tribunal. What are you insinuating? I'm humbly asking you to allow me to put an end to my days and to your worries. What are you getting at? Nothing important. Let me kill myself. You're implying that Youki... I'm implying nothing. Let me kill myself. No. You're going in front of the wartime tribunal. And you can say what you like. Here's the other half. These are the plans for Fort No II. Three copies to be sent. You'll use the pigeon. Lt Hung, in the pagoda. Lieutenant Hirouta, 3rd message. Same as before. Hello, hello? Hello, hello? We've just received the plans of Fort No II. The 2nd brigade is to attack immediately. the positions occupied by the Russian 3rd division. Hello, hello? Second brigade? Prepare to attack the 3rd division in Fort No II. "Order to send a detachment with dynamite to destroy the barbed wire in front of the Russian 3rd division. The 2nd company to follow. First Battalion on the Chinese wall. Right turn! Forward march! 2nd Battalion on the mountain. Yes, commander. The detachment of marines to Fort No II. Boris! Boris! Boris. Courage, Youki. Captain Ivamoura. I don't want to treat you as a spy. Why's that? - These are special circumstances. Lt Ranewsky and your sister are my friends. This prompts me to accord you a certain regard. Too kind. You know that the Deuxieme Bureau of Port Arthur possesses documentation of the Japanese espionage service in general, and of you in particular? I don't doubt it. My service functions better than you imagine. I know for example that you've seen your sister. Really? This surprises you? No, not totally. I know that only yesterday, you didn't finish your tea at Mrs Ranewsky's. You were there yesterday evening at your sister's? I didn't say that. - I asked you a question! Which I didn't answer. Then I'll arrest your sister. That will be a great honour for her. I can assure you she is not worthy. Take him away. Forward! They've no cover! Fire at will! Commander of artillery? Attack launched. Shell along sector 23. Communication from Fort II. Japanese artillery fire. Communication from Fort II. Bastide destroyed by repeated bombardment. Request reinforcements. Hello? Hello? Send 1st company... Retreat to the bunkers of Fort No I. Hello? Chinese wall?? Hello, observation post? Major offensive by Japanese infantry. Observation post says Japanese infantry are advancing. Fire on the Japanese infantry advancing across the Eagle's Nest. Fort No II... Fort II doesn't answer. Fort II doesn't answer. Try to reconnect through Redoubt V. Redoubt V? Well, Redoubt V? Calling Redoubt V. Communication for Fort No II. Stay down. Come on! The company is in place. Here's the captain. Order for the 6th division: launch the second assault wave. Scuttle all the ships except torpedo boat Retsvi. Novitzki! Is the Retsvi still intact? Yes, general. - Have her readied to take to sea. General Nikolaiev will give you the instructions. Novitzki, the flags and documents of our regiments are to be put on board the Retsvi. The torpedo boat must break the blockade and take our colours to a neutral port. Lt Ranewsky is to be relieved from Fort II to command the Retsvi. Send reinforcements to the bunkers. Take command! What is it? - HQ needs you. I can't abandon Fort No ll, that would be cowardly. You don't understand what's going on here Their artillery is wiping out our battery positions. It's you who doesn't understand. This is an order. I want to disobey! There's no discussion to be had. Vassidloff? Take over command of Fort No ll from Ranewsky. - You can't do this! I can't desert my comrades. The Japanese seem to know all our weak spots. I know. We must prevent panic setting in as long as we can. Come on. As long as we can? I might have said until the final hour. But back to you... They're not calling you back to hold you in a safe place. It's for a crucial mission. You may have a blindfold. - Thank you. I'm moved by your tact, however I... Do you have a request? A minor favour. What? To speak to one of the Japanese prisoners. It doesn't matter which one. You can select him. Captain Ivamoura would like to die honorably. Render him a small service: permit him to die in a Japanese uniform. Take aim. Fire. The commander is having me arrested? You hope to dissuade me? - I can explain. There's nothing to explain. Since our meeting, you've met with a Japanese spy. You know my proof? It was your brother. That's not true. - Yes it is! I want you to confirm his deposition. You will give me this. Don't make it difficult, eh? Write this down. - Commander... Your words may be used against you if necessary. You must listen... - Answer first... Did you meet Ivamoura the day before yesterday? You don't know that... - Yes or no? Yes. Right. You recorded that? Take her away. No. What am I guilty of? The judges at the wartime tribunal will inform you. You could be shot. - But I'm innocent! Why are you waiting to take her away? - You can't do this! I've done nothing wrong! This is an injustice! I'm innocent! General Stoessel has been alerted. He has your instructions. You want to talk to me? - Not to you, to Lt Ranewsky but I'd like your presence. I'm listening. The circumstances don't allow me to break this to you gently. We were both wrong about your wife. What do you mean? Mrs Ranewsky is guilty of espionage. Impossible. You're mistaken. Hear Cdr Wossidlow out. I want to, but he's misinformed. If I told that the day before yesterday, after our meeting, your wife saw Ivamoura, you'd admit she's a spy? Yes. That is what I'm telling you and I have the evidence. Here's her deposition. It's awful. Moreover, the plans for Fort No II are in enemy hands. Ivamoura communicated them with your wife's complicity. I want to see her. I want to see her. - I'll help you. That's impossible. Please, commander. She's my wife. - That's impossible. You can't refuse him this. He's leaving on a dangerous mission. See the duty officer. Hello? Bring up Mrs Ranewsky. Bureau 24. Her husband has authorisation to see her. What's going on? The bunkers have been taken. Cdr Wossidlow has informed you? - Yes, lieutenant. You haven't brought her? - She's been alerted, she's coming. Here she is. Go in! One moment, lieutenant. - What now? You can see her, but... - What? I have a difficult duty to perform... What duty? I must ask for your revolver. No. In the circumstances... it's futile. No more wartime tribunals! Get rid of this vermin. Shoot this one. Three Chinese, shoot them. One Japanese, shoot him. Attention! Halt! Halt! Order from General Stoessel: suspend the executions. Shoot all of these. Order from General Stoessel: suspend the executions. The white flag is about to be raised. - The white flag? Sort out the archives. Burn the list of spies and destroy the laboratory. Lieutenant, the task I entrust you with requires complete abnegation from you and your men. Good luck, lieutenant. I'm sorry to see you go, but this mission will help you forget these wretched hours. Boris, it's a great honour, to have been selected out of all our officers to rescue our glorious colours from the hands of the enemy. I am proud and happy for you. Sir! Sir! Listen to me! Don't go, please! Listen to me. Listen to me, I beg you. Stay for madam. Ivamoura was going to kill you. Tell her that Port Arthur is about to capitulate. She can rejoin her Japanese. One moment, madam. You're free, but I still have something to say. I see you as one cause of our defeat. I hold you responsible for the certain death facing your husband. I regret profoundly not having you shot. Off you go, now. Madam! We're free! We can rejoin the Japanese. Free! Free! Where's my husband? - At the port. He's leaving with the Retsvi. The Retsvi? Boris! You must hear me out. I'm not guilty. I know the Japanese are about to arrive. It's you I'm rejoining. You must believe me. I'm no traitor! I'd like to believe that, but I can't forget the futile deaths of my comrades. But I had nothing to do with it. You must realise that I had nothing to do with it. I kept quiet only to save you! Only to save you! Instead of trying to save my life, you should have tried to save the love I had for you. - I still deserve your love. My only fault was how much I loved you. My poor Youki. Alas, I can't reconsider. Port Arthur will always come between us. Enemy sighted off the port bow! Enemy sighted off the port bow! Stoke the boilers. Full steam ahead! Battle stations! Battle stations! Battle stations! Ready the guns. Move it! Look. Ah, yes. The big ships of the Japanese fleet. Steer 110. More speed. Everything you've got! You are Boris's Lord. Now, you're mine too. Therefore I humbly request, Lord, I know that You can't save us, but grant me this final grace: let me to die with Boris. Cease fire. Stop the machines. General order. Listen to me, my friends. Although they have the power to crush us, the enemy is looking to capture our ship. I will not allow these flags, entrusted to us by the regiments of Port Arthur, who fought to the last man, to be taken by the enemy. You would not tolerate it either, of this I'm certain. And we will complete our mission despite everything. For our honour as mariners, For Russia... open the sea-cocks. Come into my arms. We will remain together for always. Boris. Now, Youki, I won't leave you again. Do you finally believe that I am your wife? Do you finally believe that your country is mine? Where we going, there is but one country.
