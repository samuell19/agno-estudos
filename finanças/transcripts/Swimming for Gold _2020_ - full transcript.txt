Carpenter is an exceptional swimmer. It's no wonder she has fans all over the world. Big things are on the cards for this American sweetheart. Her coach is also her dad and a former Olympian. He said that he's very proud. Claire Carpenter does her patented flip turn and heads into the final lap. She's won the gold! She's one of the most exciting swimmers on the American team and it's easy to see why. Claire Bear? Claire! Oh, gosh. What? - We need to talk. - I'll be in for ice cream at 3:00. Now! Oh my god. Australia? Ugh, an all-boys team? Taking time off did not mean months of endless napping. But I love naps. Yeah, a little too much. Listen, they need help preparing for the Nationals. OK, the top finishers, they're Olympic qualifiers. You know firsthand how important that is. Cool, and what now? - OK. Well, it's in Brisbane. - What? Isn't that where Mikayla trains? You're not going to see her. You're gonna have your own suite in the coaches' quarters. This... Hey, this is gonna be fun. I'm having plenty of fun here. Little too much. Sweetheart, you haven't done anything since the last meet. That was three months ago. Disturbing news from the world of Olympic swimming, where America's sweetheart Claire Carpenter has gone viral. After refusing to race, we attempted to interview her and... well, see for yourself. Can you explain why you refused to swim back there? Looked like you were afraid of the water. No cameras. Brad! Stop laughing! While video of the incident has gained over 12 million views, Claire Carpenter has dropped out of sight. Begging the question, will she ever swim again? - I sent apology letters. - And that was a great start. You know what? I know it can be scary to face your fears, but... I know that you can get back in the water. I just need a break. ♪ I'd like to tell you how I really feel ♪ ♪ I'd like to show the world that I'm the exception ♪ ♪ I'd like to tell you how I really feel ♪ ♪ I'd like to show the world ♪ ♪ That I can be different ♪ ♪ Just give me a reason ♪ ♪ And I'll burn you ♪ All the way ♪ ♪ I'd love to show the world how I'm made ♪ ♪ I'm done with all your lessons and your planning... ♪ OK. So you're going to be picked up by car from Brisbane Airport, dropped off at the camp... where you will be met by Coach Bodhi. Coach Bodhi? Yeah, he's... He's a guy I used to train with. He's recently adopted some rather unorthodox methods. Anyway, you got a month till the meet and I think that's gonna be just enough time to right the ship. - Well, as long as I don't see her. - You are there to coach, not compete. So I guess this is it. Proud of you for doing this. Your mom would be too. Would she? Sometimes I forget what she even sounded like. Well that can happen after ten years. OK, give me a hug. Come here. Hey! - Healthy snacks only! - That's the beauty of a break. Oh, hey, almost forgot. Yeah? To replace the ones Mikayla stole. Cool. OK, well... Call me if you need anything. OK. Hey, do you know where the... Oh, thank you so much. That's great. Hello? G'day? Anybody? Good day. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for a Bodhi Coachy. I mean coach... Coach Bodhi. Come on. I know where to find him. Yeah, he has trouble with things like time and... space for that matter. Yeah, well I heard the training methods here are a little... different. Don't worry. Girls' team, they've got their act together. And the boys? Their captain does the best that he can. It's just up here. Brace yourself. Bodhi? Not now, Liam. I'm on the verge of a winning mantra. Still... like the rattlesnake. The mouse will come to you. Yes, that's a winning mantra! I'm Claire. Uhhh? Calvin's daughter. Oh! Calvin Carpenter. Best back 50 in a 200 individual medley I've ever seen-- What time is it? Oh, I'm sorry, time... flies when you're manifesting success. I need to write that down. I'll leave you to it. - Bye, Liam. - Bye. "...success." OK. Claire Carpenter! Yeah. Ah. - Oh. - Oh. That's a bit low. Welcome... to Sundale. Go, Sundale. Let's go. This way. So excited to have you here. Ask and the universe shall provide. Morning, Stefan. No running in the hallway. Yes sir. I am grateful the stars have aligned for your visit. The boys aren't quite grasping any of my motivational techniques. Yeah, what techniques are you using? The very latest. Positive affirmation, visualisation, connectedness. I'm surprised that isn't working. Me too. I can't... I can't bear to think of these kids without a team. If we don't win at Nationals, we lose our sponsor. Emu Milk. And the camp will close. Oh, want some help? Oh, thank you. Oh. Good morning. No running. Are these the coaches' quarters? There was a tiny... massive leak. So you're in the girls' dorm now. Whoo-hoo! Party. Pillow fights. There's your bed and... there's your desk and... - Uh... I was promised my own room. The sky promises rain... yet there are deserts. This is the only available bed. OK. I guess I'll make it work. - Mikayla Michaels? - Claire Carpenter? I cannot live with her. I have a rigorous training schedule and this disruption... What is she even doing here? I'm coaching. Coaching what? Your ego? Coaching future champions, something you'll never be. I championed all over you last time. - Oh come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Feel the energy. Visualise a friendship blossoming between you. If you can imagine it... you can will it into reality. What? That doesn't make any sense. Or does it? You have an extra centimetre? - Happy? - Not really. - Hey! - What now? We'll need to agree on some rules. They'll have to do for now. That counts as conversation. Thank you. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! They told me you were here but I thought they were playing a joke on me, like when they told me a tidal wave was coming here. So I wore a life-vest for a week. But you're not like that tidal wave, you're real. Remember to breathe. I'm Annabelle Shumpert. Is that a name or a condition? President of the Australia Branch of the Claire Army. I'm a Claire Bear for life. I am your biggest fan. Like, I know there's that one fan in Belgium who says she's the biggest but she's lying and I will fight her. It was nice to meet you, but I haven't eaten since the plane, so... Follow me. Move! Claire Carpenter coming through. So, cafeteria's only open at mealtimes but you can get snacks whenever you want. Oh and don't forget, three daily servings of Emu Milk. Your emus make milk? Not exactly. I wouldn't look into it too deeply. Maybe we should just focus on eating and not talking. Yeah. Yeah. We should. Yeah. Yay. So, where have you been the last two months? Do you like Australia? Are you gonna swim for us? Does that mean you have dual citizenship? Do you have a secret Australian sister? Is it me? Could it be me? Can I be... Could it be? Amy, right? It's Annabelle. It's fine. Annabelle... I'm just going to take this to my room. Just... I'm so tired. Oh, yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. - Wanna high five? - Sorry. Yep, it's fine. We attempted to interview her and... Well, see for yourself. It looked like you were afraid of the water? No cameras. Coops? Cooper! Bro, you're not even listening. I'm totally lost on this new map. Not as lost as this girl I met this morning. A girl? Yeah, some American. And what's she doing here? Swimming with the girls' team, I guess. Is she cute? Ooh-la-la, Liam's in love! I can't afford to get distracted. Maybe your parents will lighten up. Oh, yeah. Not until I'm Dr. Liam Henderson. Of course, bro, it won't matter if the camp closes. If the camp closes, I'm gonna be a full-time gamer. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. Well, until then... ...we got practice. Let's go. I'm sorry, but who steams their swimsuit? Some of us like to look our best. Well, it's just gonna get wet. Yours managed to stay dry. Alright, well, try not to steal anything while I'm gone. Howdy! They say that in America, right? Anyway, I was thinking - so, an athlete of your stature has so many obligations. You know, like autographs and endorsements and award shows. Where you going with this? Maybe, like, I should be your, um... ...assistant? Maybe? A little bit? Yeah, you know, I guess I could use an intern. OK. Alright, first order of business... show me where the boys practice. Swimmers, gather round. Come in, come in. Namaste. As you know, Nationals are less than four weeks away and we've got to be one with the water and centre ourselves mentally. To help us with the final mile, I've expanded our collective to include another passionate coach. Oh, here we go. And who better than another swimmer who won two gold medals at the last World Championships? She's one of America's top athletes. Give it up for Claire Carpenter. Whoo! Whoo! Hi. Oh! Um... Catastrophe Claire! So... some of you have heard of me. No cameras. No cameras. I just want to say that I'm excited to get to know each and every one of you and help out with training. Yeah, help out with training! And with that I'll introduce our team captain, Liam Henderson. - I didn't realise. - You're... That's right. You two have already met. Silly me! So... - ...how would you like to start? - Come on? She doesn't even swim anymore. She's still swims. You swim. Right? Don't you? Yeah, of course. I swim. I'm just on a break but... It doesn't mean that I can't coach. Can't take this seriously. Look, I'm sorry but... I don't think this is a good idea. OK. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... It's OK. I'll handle the rest of practice. Catastrophe Claire strikes again! - Charlotte by the bushes. Harriet right flank, Jamie left. Zoe and Chloe by the trees. - The Eagle's in flight. - Places everyone! Oh, Claire Army Field Manual Rule number 17... if at first you don't succeed-- Attack! Claire! Sweetheart, how are ya? Dad, I want to come home. Now. Yeah, listen, you know, this whole thing can be daunting at first but... - Dad, Dad... - ...I know you got this. The boys won't listen to me and the girls all hate me. And I'm sure you can win them over. Nobody wants me here, Dad. Please, just book me a flight home, OK? - Listen... - You know, I'll be fine. It's fine. I'll see you in a month. Bye, Dad. Catastrophe Claire strikes again! You don't want me here? Fine. Is my Uber here? I think you were dreaming. Yeah, I was... and it was glorious. Breakfast is almost over. You're gonna miss it. So? So, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That's right at the top of the Claire Army Field Manual. Annabelle, please. Just leave me alone. Don't let the water balloons bother you. They're the traditional welcome for every new swimmer. Although Mikayla really took this one to the next level. Of course. Mikayla was behind this. Just give me ten more minutes, OK? I get it. We can nap for a little bit. - Oh! Meditation? It is the key to true enlightenment. I'd really love it if you would enlighten the boys on your journey. Our journey... to the Nationals. Yeah, I really don't think that's a good idea. They really need you. We really need you. You remind me of your mum. She gave me some great sage coaching advice once. I still use it. "For it is in the giving that we receive." Come on. So, they're good boys. They work hard. Strokes are good. They listen. It's just not quite comprehending my motivational techniques. So I was thinking that-- Cooper move your arm. I was... What? Oh. So I was thinking, I'd really like to see how you practice in the States. Listen up, everyone. Claire's going to be running practice today. Well, when you win gold, you can start coaching. OK? Namaste. Yeah, OK. Um... Start with some laps. How many? What stroke? Lots of whatever makes you happy. Happiness is so important. Sweet! Doggy paddle for me! Yeah. Go with that. For a truly effective practice, you just have to find your comfort zone. Ah, very good, Claire. Why not go over something... useful? Like your famous flip turn technique. Thought you couldn't learn from someone who doesn't swim. You know, when I first met you, I thought... You thought what? I had a different impression, that's all. OK. Alright, everyone, party time's over. Let's get started. - Claire! The girls wanted to-- Hey, great robe! Is that terry towelling? I like Egyptian cotton but you've gotta be careful with sheets. Grandma says they rip you off with thread count if you're not careful. OK. What do you want, Annabelle? Oh, right. The girls wanted to apologise about the water balloons. - Mikayla made us do it. We're juniors and she's a senior, so... We're not mean. Thanks. I'll talk to her. - Marco? - Polo! - Marco? - Polo! - Marco? - Polo! And... what is this teaching them? - Underwater acoustics. - Ah. Helps with spatial sense in the swim lane. Oh... Yes. - Marco? - Polo! - Polo. Duck, duck... duck, duck duck, duck... goose! Is this really how you practice in the States? Yeah, totally. Helps with team building. Hmm. Ah, good. Hey... coach. How you doing? Can I go back to my dorm room? I have to, uh... Sure. Helps with hand-eye coordination. Wait. Really? Oh, thanks coach. Alright! Goose! ♪ And we're lazing around forever together ♪ Be outta here in no time. You're only just waking up? Breakfast is over-rated. That was lunch. Oh, man, really? I was really looking forward to those tater tots. Rule number six, "Pick up after yourself." Rule number 13, "My side of the room is my business." There's gotta be an exception when your mess starts attracting bugs to our room. Agree to disagree. G'day! Well, someone's in better spirits. I've been trying to contact you. Yeah, I've been at practice. OK. Still feeling homesick? Nah, I can stick it out. It's fine. Well, what's created the shift in attitude? Well, you know, I figured that I could just sit and do nothing just as easily at this pool as the one at home. Claire! Speaking of which, I should get to my lounge chair. Bye, Dad. Hmm. Yeah, of course I've been studying. Look, Dad, I'm already late for practice, OK. Let's just discuss this later. Oh! Hey! - Quiet time. - Quiet time. Come on, come on, come on, come on! We need to talk. What are you doing in my office? You should really make an appointment. What's going on here? I know what it looks like but Claire explained everything. We must love our sport, love swimming, to be the best at it. Claire is reminding us to love the pool. Is that so? It's important to keep the passion alive. Claire, you can hear what I have to say right now or in private - it's up to you. Is he always like this? Depends. I guess the umbrella's not the only thing throwing shade today, is it? - You're making us worse. - That's debatable. No, it's not. Claire, our average 100-metre freestyle time has gone up since you got here. - OK. - I care about my team. OK? We were just having a little fun. Fine. Claire, you used to be one of the best swimmers in the world. Did you have fun like this when you were training? Really training. I know my team. They may be having fun now but if they don't show up to compete, they are going to hate themselves the next day. If there's going to be a camp next year, then we need to win and that means beating the best of the best. Yeah. Look... if you don't want to be here, then... you should probably just go. You guys don't want me here either, so, I'll talk to Bodhi. It's cool. Hiring you was just... another one of Bodhi's crazy ideas. You don't think I have what it takes to coach the boys? That's not-- No, you guys didn't even give me a chance. So you want coaching? You got it. Sorry to interrupt. But we need to enter into phase two. I'm loving this energy. OK. So here's what I'm thinking. I can take care of the day-to-day coaching if you do the really important work - visualising victory and channelling holistic eating. Visualising victory, channelling holistic eating. Tick, tick. Yeah, and that, that is a great start. But if we're going to will something this big into existence, we need 24/7 focus. Yes, we do, 365, or 366 on a leap year, but 365. Yeah, so you can just be channelling positive energy through meditation and growing fresh produce for the team. Done. It'll be fresh. It'll be fresher than fresh. - I love that. - It'll be so fresh you won't even know that it's fresh. It'll be... Shh. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes! See ya. Oh, how'd I do? I beat my time, I just know it. Huh? Oh... um... I didn't time you. Oh. That's OK. I'll just... summon up all my energy and do it again. Sorry, I've... I've got a lot on my mind. Claire? Yeah, her too. Oh, it's Elsa Chang, isn't it? Would you believe I've lost to her by one-tenth of a second, three separate times? She's like the Tonya Harding of teen swimming. I need real focus for this meet... and rooming with Claire isn't helping. Well... have you tried being nice to her? You know, my grandma always used to say, "Catch more koalas with eucalyptus than with a net." We had to put her in a home. But you know, you get it, yeah. Where's your team swimsuit? - Go! - Sorry.

Come on, you can do this, Annabelle! You're late. I thought-- Fall in! It's been brought to my attention that training has been too easy. I thought we were tapering. Yeah, that was a test. I wanted to see if any of you actually wanted to train. You all failed, by the way. So from now on I'm going to be training you whether you like it or not. I'll be turning you into swimmers of iron. Doesn't iron sink, though? OK, we have a joker do we? Get in the water and swim butterfly until I say stop. Is she for real? OK, OK, OK. As for the rest of you, join him.

Oh, that doesn't bode so well for us. Yeah, well, supposedly she's in the best shape of her life. Fabulous. And here am I just worrying about that American slob. Claire's never been to Australia before. Maybe it's culture shock. Yeah, watching us drive on the left must be so traumatising! I thought you said it looked like an episode of 'Hoarders'. She even swept. Maybe you were wrong about her. ♪ Keep shakin' it ♪ ♪ Keep shakin' it ♪ Let's go. Move! Move! Move! ♪ Work it, girl Keep shakin' it ♪ ♪ Keep shakin' it ♪ Faster! Faster! Let's go!

You know, you're not exactly Little Miss Silence either. I'm responding to my fan mail. Remember when you had fans? Even the depleted Claire Army can beat the Mikayla Not-Many. And I still have plenty of fans! Who sends snail mail anyway? People who appreciate penmanship and the intimacy of a letter. So... prisoners? Some of my fans have made mistakes. Haven't we all? You do realise it's September, right? Who keeps their New Year's resolution? Champions. I literally can't move anything. I'm never gonna be on the Twitch stream tonight. Coop... our stroke rate is improving. Dude, if we can maintain and hold this speed, then we should be able to get the 100 metres in just under 50 seconds. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Coach Bodhi. Alright, I'll admit... Claire is a little harsh. A little? She's a monster. With a little whistle! Two champions neck and neck, both refusing to give up, arms tiring, brows sweating, but still, they still got it. Still got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, Dad. So, you making friends? I'm making winners. OK, so you're coaching. Yeah, I'm whipping them into shape. That's good. Listen, you be careful you don't go too hard, you know, coaching is not just about physical exercises. Look, you don't wanna run them into the ground. Run them into the ground. Got it. - Yeah, that's not what I said. - Bye, Dad. I said-- Congratulations. You survived. See you all tonight at 9 p.m. for our first round of night sessions. You're being serious? I'm just saying for us, we've had enough. We should be tapering. We should be getting ready for the championship. - Cooper. - What? I'm speaking for the team this time. I'm sorry, but we're not training anymore. Yeah, I did this exact program myself and it made me a better swimmer. Then why don't you get in the water and you show us? You want me to swim? Fine. See? See? Let's go. Claire, are you OK? What do you care? You really have a phobia about water, don't you? Just... didn't want to get my hair wet. Look, I'm sorry about the guys. Just give it some time. They'll come around, I promise. Yeah, I don't care. I'm done with the sport anyway. Be a shame to lose such an amazing coach. I don't need your flattery. I'm not trying to flatter you. I'm being serious. Your methods are helping. They hate me. You don't need to prove anything to them, OK? Maybe there's a middle ground between being a boot camp sergeant and a beach bum? It's just a thought. Come on, Claire. Hey. Hey, you know I cancelled the night swims, right? Yeah. I just like to come out here and chill. Look up at the stars. Don't tell the guys I said that. Yeah, you can trust me. I assume you're not going to get in the water. I mean, I want to... more than anything. So why not? It's OK. You can trust me too. Yeah, well, you heard about my freak-out at the swim meet... right? It's pretty hard to avoid. Yeah. Well, I had a water-skiing accident right before that. I ended up in the hospital. Is that why you're afraid of water? I'm not afraid of the water. I'm afraid of drowning. When I wiped out, I hit my head and I was stuck under the water and then I couldn't tell which way was up. Claire, that... must have been terrifying. Yeah, it was. After that, I thought that I might never get to the Olympics. What if all that training was for nothing? Was that why you started swimming? To make the Olympics? No. Not at first, at least. You know... when I'm in the water, I just... I just feel free. I know it's just following a black line but... it's the best place in the world. Oh, my god. Are you kidding me? Dear number 4981... Wait up! - I'm coming! - Hey! - Don't leave without me. - Hey! Hey, wait up! Hey, why didn't you tell me about today? I didn't think you'd want to go. What is Claire doing here? This is for swimmers only. No coaches. - I invited her. - Ooh! Where are we going? You'll see. ♪ I want it to last forever now that we're together...♪ Time to introduce you to an Aussie tradition. How high is that? About three metres, give or take. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Don't worry. No-one's going to make you jump. Yeah. Hard pass. I figured. Well, let me know if you change your mind. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! What are you doing? Not sure what you're referring to Mikayla. Don't play dumb. Why are you being nice to that girl? I heard she's torturing your team. Torture? That's a pretty strong word, OK? Accurate, but strong. Then why put up with her? We're getting better. Really? Well, I should hope so. The meet's in two weeks. My squad will be ready. Hope her coaching pays off. The team depends on it. Mmm. Come on, Annabelle! You got this! Three, two, one... - OK. Yeah! Oh, my gold, it's cod! Ooh! Oh, I found you! Thought you were eaten by a dingo. No such luck. Want to talk about it? No. Claire Army Field Manual rule number 14, "Don't be afraid to ask for help." Why do you believe in me? Are you serious? Because you're, like, the queen of swimming. Because you have the greatest flip turn the world has ever seen. Because you've got, like, a bajillion Instagram followers. Stop me if this is too much. Can I ask you something? Hit me. Do you like me? Like, as a person. Of course I do. As a friend? We're friends? I mean, if we're not, I don't think I have any. I was happy being your assistant but... I'd like to be your friend. Yeah, I'd like that too. Can I be honest with you... friend to friend? I just don't recognise myself. Like, when did I become this disagreeable person? Did something happen? All of a sudden, you just stopped swimming. Yeah, it's complicated. You know... my grandma always used to say... "It's not what happens to us that defines us. "It's how we handle it." So, do friends hug? - I pushed it, didn't I? - Mm-hmm. - Hey... can we talk? - Wanted to apologise-- - What? Wait, what? I know I haven't exactly been the easiest to live with. You've got a real knack for understatement. And I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I've been going through some... stuff. That doesn't mean I should take it out on you. Well, I'm sorry for the water balloon prank. And I want you to know that I forgive you... for stealing my lucky goggles. I never stole your goggles. Oh come on. I saw you. The Americas meet. I went to go shower and put my goggles in the locker... saw you. When I came back, they were gone. And so are my goggles. I swear I never took them. I remember that day. As soon as you went in to shower, guess who else walked in. Elsa Chang. No! Why didn't you tell me? Would you have listened? That really messed with me. After that, I lost the race to Elsa and then... I went water skiing to clear my head. I was awful to you for no reason. I haven't been much better. Can we start over? I'd like that. At ease. Guys, it's not a trick this time. She means it. Looking good! Keep it up. Tim, remember not to breathe flats to wall. Nice, Cooper. Mike, your dolphin kicks were great but your dive was too deep. Nice! Great job, everyone. Nice work. Who is this person? She's our coach. 97... 98... 99... 100. How was practice today? I'm still one-tenth of a second behind. It's never easy right before a meet, is it? I just... I get so tense. And if one thing's out of place, it just throws me off. Oh, yeah, I feel that. Once I ran out of low-volume conditioner right before a meet and I freaked out because I was convinced it would change the drag on my swim cap. No way! Well, once, I came second the day I had an omelette for breakfast. So? So I haven't had eggs in two years. My gosh. Seriously, though. I'm the most superstitious swimmer you'll ever meet. I just wish I could relax. Yeah, maybe you should try meditation. Not that I'm suggesting you go full Coach Bodhi, but... What did you even say to Coach Bodhi? I told them that I had a vision... of him just visualising victory for the boys and growing produce for them. Yeah. That's so funny. I reckon you'll get along with the girls. Yeah? You should join us for dinner tomorrow. Alright. Thanks. Ohm. Guys, I am so proud of you and the hard work you've been putting in. So to finish off practice, instead of ending with sprints, let's end with a different kind of competition. So, whoever gets this greased watermelon to their end of the pool first... gets to eat it. It's mine, bro! Great way to end practice, Coach. Hey. You came! - I brought cookies. - Give them to me! It is so good to be here. Been spending way too much time with the boys. Yeah... with Liam. I mean, he's... he's nice. He is a stone-cold hottie. Like, woah... Like, woooah! Like... I'll be right back. Hey, Coops. - Hey, Catastrophe Claire. - Mmm. I'll never live that down. Wow. Shouldn't you be making everyone laugh over there? Nah. They're talking about swimming... again. You know, sometimes it's just good to have a break. Yeah. I get it. What do you reckon, Claire? Are you gonna go back to swimming? Are you ever gonna try it again, or...? I mean, I don't know. I've been training and doing it my whole life. Yeah. It's been really nice just being here. And being normal. You gotta do what makes you happy. Gotta do what makes you happy. - Alright. Thanks, Claire. - Bye. Bye. Hey. You're missing a pretty cool night. I spoke to my parents tonight. They know the dean of the medical school. The day of the meet? Just feels like... my swimming career is over, you know? No, you love swimming. I see it out there from you every day. Yeah, my parents don't get that. I just wish... One of them had been a swimmer, you know? And then maybe they'd understand. Well, having an ex-Olympian dad isn't much easier. The constant pressure to succeed. It's better than constant pressure to quit. Mmm. I don't want this camp to end. It's been pretty great, hasn't it? Do you have to go back to America? Are you really going to quit swimming? Maybe some more... colour. I don't know. Attention everybody! Listen up! I just received an urgent communique from the Claire Army Field Office in Sydney. This Claire Army thing is really getting out of hand. According to my source, the Changs just posted new personal bests in practice. We'll be facing the fastest qualifying times in the history of Nationals. You're supposed to tell me things like this before you just say them to everyone. They're just so fast. I know, but when the waters get rough, swimmers get tough. You got this. OK, guys, I know it's no fun getting up this early but I will do everything I can to prep you. So let's start off with technique, because you get enough endurance training at team practice. I will practice every waking minute if it helps me beat Elsa Chang. Start with a quick warm-up, then show me those flip turns. Looking good. They can be better, though. Let me explain how I do it. So, basically, it's a corkscrew twist off the wall. You flip less as you turn and then twist as you streamline. Yeah, just twist a split-second later, it'll be even better. Claire Field Army Manual number five. Early bird gets the fish. And... So, do you think I could join in? Get over here. Yeah, let's see those again. Nice, Liam! - That actually felt faster. - Yeah, it looks faster. Claire, thank you. How was your insanely early practice? - It was good. - Yeah. I'm starving. You ready? Yeah, I'll... Hold on... I'm still waking up. She worked us pretty hard today. Ah... The things we do for love. Whoo. Oi, dude! - We're just friends. - Yeah. Follow your heart, bro. Nah. Otherwise, you're just wasting time. 148... 149... 150. Why are 150 push-ups so much harder than 140? Dawn practice was rough. Morning was miserable and this afternoon was excruciating. Still on for early morning practice tomorrow? Oh, definitely. So... how do you learn to coach so well? Your dad? Yeah. But he says that he learned everything he knows for my mom. They sound like awesome parents. They are. They were. My mum passed away when I was six. Claire, I'm... so sorry. Can I ask what happened? Yeah. Yeah, it was a car accident. And ever since then it's just been me and my dad. Swimming always kept us close. Well, he must be so proud of you. The only reason why my parents care about swimming is because it gives them an excuse to send me off to camp. They leave for Bali the minute I'm gone. They haven't invited me once. They've gotta recognise that you're one of the best swimmers in the country though, right? I honestly don't know. But I'm hoping if I keep winning my meets, then... then they'll start watching me. That's why I work so hard. And hey, even if your parents don't say it... I know they care about you. It's OK. This club is my home. But... I don't know what I'd do if we lose it. I'll do everything I can to help you keep it. Thanks. I got some wheatgrass... wheatgrass, wheatgrass. Oh, oh, oh. I've got wheatgrass... Double shot! - You got up early? - Yep. - To swim. - Yep. Is this following your heart, bro? This is maintaining my pride. Yeah, besides, can't let my roomie show me up. Namaste. One for you. One for you. Come on, you know you want to. Gonna win championships. - OK. Er. Cooper! Good to see you. Why don't you start us off with some laps? I'm already regretting this. Ugh! Alright, everyone. Bring it in. Alright. This is our last practice. So take the rest of today to focus and just rest up. I'm really proud of all of you for your hard work and dedication. - Thanks, Claire. - Thanks, Claire. Now let's win tomorrow! Claire, thank you. This is the best prepared we've ever been for a race. And you know what? If the Changs win, at least we know we gave it our best shot. For ourselves, our team, for the camp. No, you'll beat them, I know you will. Just gotta believe in yourself. Thanks. Alright, well, I'm gonna head back to my room. I gotta organise... something... I'll catch up with you later. Do you want to... do you want to go for a walk? Yeah, sure. Last practice at sundown, eh? I'm really glad I came here. Yeah, it was brave of you. It could not have been easy coaching a bunch of boys in another country but you made it work. Claire, these are the fastest times we've had. Well, I had passionate, dedicated swimmers. Oh, well, thank you. So your parents are letting you swim tomorrow? I worked it out. Liam... some people never find their passion. And you have. - You shouldn't give that up. - It's not that simple. You of all people should know that. Look, Claire, don't get me wrong. I have complete faith you'll get back in the pool and you'll dominate again. I don't know. I think my swimming days are over. And I think I'm OK with that. For what it's worth... I think you're the best coach we've ever had. I mean, we've only ever had Coach Bodhi... but still... Well, that means a lot. Hey, I wanted to ask you... do you want to be my girlfriend? You... you know I can't stay in Australia. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the National Swimming Championships, coming to you live from Brisbane. Jill Millions reporting live from the National Championships... ...the premier qualif-- Shouldn't you be at the meet? Is everything OK? Relax, Dad. I'm here. Just wanted to hear your voice. Well, I've been on pins and needles. So, how's the team? They've got a real chance. Now it's just up to them to seize it. - No sign of the Changs yet. - Oh my god, is that Nicole? Hey, girls. Are you swimming today? Yeah. I am. Yeah, I'm in the 50-metre breaststroke. I just love you so much. I watch all your YouTube videos, like, all of them. Hey, I've got to go and race but good luck and swim fast today, alright? Oh my god. She touched me on the arm! - Focus! - Ow. OK. Come on. But there's more than competition on everyone's mind. Rumour has it, disgraced American swimmer Claire Carpenter has been coaching the team from Sundale. - Is that her? - Wha... Where? It's not funny, Brad. I knew we'd find you here. Do you realise how poorly it reflected on us when you didn't show up? Dad, I have to swim today. Liam. You must be the Hendersons? Liam has told me so much about you. You must be so proud of your son. I've never seen anyone work so hard. He's the best swimmer on the team. And you are? I'm Claire... Hey, Claire! Excuse me. Hey, Bodhs. I feel a strong energy in the air. I've done nothing but visualise, believe, achieve. I've been floating like the sands from the Sahara to the Nullarbor. I've been at one with the tree. And like the petals of the sunflower, they've blossomed. The gold is ours. Once I deliver one of my patented motivational speeches, of course. Yeah, how about doing that from the stands? Just visualise them hearing you. Visualise, believe, achieve. That's a great idea. G'day. Oh, sorry! Claire Army rule number six... probably need a swimsuit-- Check! Claire Army Field Manual Rule number seven, generously apply sunscreen. Check. OK, Claire Army Field Manual rule number-- Annabelle, stop. But I haven't finished my checklist. Yeah, well, guess what - worrying about all the rules will slow you down. You've got this! You really think so? I know so. Now go get 'em. Aye, aye, Captain Claire. Aye, aye. Breaststroke swimmers, please report to your lane. Oh my god! OK, I'll be fine. - You know... - Just keep going. You got it. Annabelle! Annabelle! Come on, Annabelle. Come on. Come on, Annabelle! Come on. In first place, JoJo Tam. Second place, Annabelle Shumpert. Third place, Kelly Son Hing. Don't get down on yourself. Are you kidding? I came in second! That's the spirit! I'm so proud of you. The best finish before I had this was sixth. It's like my birthday and Christmas all rolled into one. Annabelle, you just put us in second place in the team standings.

Hmm. Claire! Thank you for everything, Coach. You must thank yourself, not me. - It's in the giving... - That we receive. How right you are. Positive thinking is powerful. I was thinking... how about continuing coaching? You could finish school out here. - Really? - Yeah. - I'll ask my dad. Yeah. - Yes! Oh! Congratulations. Emus are champions and so are you. It would be an honour to remain a sponsor of your camp. Yes! I'm here now with today's winner, Ariarne Titmus. How did you feel like you raced today? Put together a great race and it's great to win gold here - in front of an amazing crowd-- - Great, great. Comment on your first competitive loss? Brad! Stop laughing! Oh, that was just incredible. - Yeah, the way you raced. - Amazing. Thanks. You guys have already met Claire. - She's my-- - Girlfriend. She's my girlfriend. She's the best coach I've ever had. Well, your son is extremely talented. Guys, I'm sorry about the meeting. But you really need to know that I don't want to quit swimming. - Liam-- - Dad... Med school is always going to be there. I really want to see where this takes me now. Well, your mother and I certainly don't want to make you unhappy. Yeah. Liam, I don't think we fully understood just how much swimming meant to you. You're almost an adult now. It's time we respect your choices. - We're proud of you. - Thank you. - So proud. - I love you guys. Hey. Whoo-hoo! Yes! - Well done, darling! - Great swim, son! That was tremendous! It really was. - Mum, Dad... can I be honest just for one second? I'm sorry. Uh... Um, uh... I really want to quit swimming. I'm sorry. It's just... my heart's just not in it anymore. But I've got more cardboard. More paint, more signs. What will you do instead? Well, I thought about it and I've been getting really good, and I was thinking of doing competitive gaming. - Competitive? - Yeah. - E-sports fill up arenas. - Yes? We could go? Yeah, let's do it. Can we still come and cheer for you? Yeah, of course. Let's do it, son. Oh, darling! Let's celebrate! Well, we have a surprise for you. You know flowers are a nice surprise. Chocolates, that sort of thing. Look, you don't have to jump. But if you do, we'll be right here. Guess I can't drown next to the two best swimmers I've ever met, right? So... I'm better than you?
