The story that I want to tell you cannot be found in a book. They say the history of the west was written from the saddle of a horse, but it's never been told from the heart of one... Not till now. I was born here in this place that would come to be called the old west but to my kind, the land was ageless. It had no beginning and no end, no boundary between earth and sky. Like the wind in the buffalo grass we belonged here. We would always belong here. They say the mustang is the spirit of the west. Whether that west was won or lost in the end you'll have to decide for yourself but the story I want to tell you is true. I was there, and I remember. I remember the sun and the sky and the wind calling my name in a time when wild horses ran free. Here I am. This is me. I come into this world So wild and free Here I am. So young and strong. Right here in the place Where I belong. It's a new world. It's a new start. It's alive with the beating Of a young heart. It's a new day. In a new land. And it's waiting for me Here I am Oh, it's a new world. It's a new start. It's alive with the beating Of a young heart. Yeah, it's a new day. In a new land And it's waiting for me. Here I am And so I grew from colt to stallion as wild and reckless as thunder over the land racing with the eagle, soaring with the wind. Flying? There were times I believed I could. Like my father before me I became leader of the Cimarron herd and with that honor came responsibility. I hear the wind Across the plain. A sound so strong That calls my name. It's wild like the river. It's warm like the sun. Yeah, it's here. This is where I belong Under the starry skies. Where eagles have flown. This place is paradise. It's the place I call home. The moon on the mountains. The whisper through the trees. The waves on the water. Let nothing come Between this and me 'Cause everything I want. Is everything that's here. And when we're all together. There's nothing to fear Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh... And wherever I wander. The one thing I've learned. Yeah. It's to here I will always. Always... Return... Something new came upon the land one night, something that would change my life forever, and so, my journey began. A wiser horse might have turned and run but I wanted to know what strange creatures were here. What the... - Son of a... - Shh... Look. Man, look at that stallion! It's beautiful! Mmm, Sadie Mae. - Ugh! - Ugh! Get him, boys! Easy, boy! C'mon, boys! Let's go! C'mon, boys! Hyah! Hyah! Where did he go? I don't see him. We'll find him! What the... Faster! What? Get him! Come on!

Get back from him! Take him! Take him, Joe! Get the horse! He's ours now. Hold him! Watch him! Watch the lines! Watch the lines! Come on! He can do all the kicking he wants now. It won't do no good. Careful... Careful... I was scared, and I didn't know what was going to happen to me but at least my mother and the herd were safe. - Come on! - Let's go! Yo... Come on... Gotta fight another fight. I gotta run another night. Get it out, check it out. I'm on my way And it don't feel right. I gotta get me back. I can't be beat And that's a fact. It's okay, I'll find a way. Ain't gonna take me down No way. No. Yeah, don't judge a thing Till you know what's inside it. Don't push me I'll fight it. Never gonna give in Never gonna give it up, no. No. If you can't catch a wave Then you're never gonna ride it. You can't come uninvited. Never gonna give in Never gonna give it up, no. You can't take me, I'm free Why did it all go wrong? I want to know What's going on. What's this holding me? I'm not where I'm supposed to be. I gotta fight another fight. I gotta fight With all my might. I'm getting out, so check it out. You're in my way, yeah You better watch out... Open the gate! Come on! Don't judge a thing Till you know what's inside it. Don't push me, I'll fight it. Never gonna give in Never gonna give it up, no. No. If you can't catch a wave Then you're never gonna ride it. You can't come uninvited. Never gonna give in Never gonna give it up, no You can't take me, I'm free I'm free What seems to be the problem, gentlemen? We got us a crazy one here, Sir. Pure mustang, Colonel. Really? The army has dealt with wild horses before. This one will be no different. Come on, mustang. I remember the first time I saw a rattler curled up in my path. - Induct this animal, Sergeant. - Yes, Sir! This one didn't look like a rattler but I was still thinking, snake. Take up that slack. Grab him! Grab him! Come on, horse! Okay, Murphy, he's all yours. He's a wild one. We'll see how wild he is when I'm done with him. See that? You want to fight, do you? Right. Make sure that's good and tight. - Murphy, look out! - Watch out! He's a wild one. You all right, Murph? You... Murph, you okay? Corporal, round up some volunteers to take this animal to the stables. Not the stables. Sir? The corral. It's time to break that horse. Well, you think that you can take me on. You must be crazy... Make sure it's good and tight. There ain't a single thing you've done. That's gonna faze me Oh, but if you want to have a go. I just want to let you know. Yeah, get off of my back And into my game. Get out of my way 'Cause I'm wild and untamed. Get out of my face Or give it your best shot. I think it's time You better face the fact. Get off of my back... Okay, my turn! You know it's all just a game. That I'm playin'. Don't think that you can find a way in... Lousy heap of horse flesh! That's what I'm sayin'... Come on! Run out of there! Now, if you want to have a go. I just want to let you know Get off of my back. And into my game. Get out of my face 'Cause I'm wild and untamed. Get out of my way or give it your best shot... We got a rider! But you know this train Is comin' off this track. Get off of my back Yeah, get off of my back. Get off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... Get off, get off, get off, get off. Get off, get off, get off. Get off of my back - Sergeant! - Yes, Sir. Tie this horse to the post. No food or water. - Three days. - Yes, Sir. My heart galloped through the skies that night, back to my herd, where I belonged and I wondered if they missed me as much as I missed them. Get some water over to the stable. Yes, Sir. We caught a hostile! Bring him back this way! What do we have here? We caught him by the supply wagons, Sir. Ah, a Lakota. Not as tall as the Cheyenne, not as fine-featured as the Crow. Take him away, gentlemen. Show him our best. Corporal, take him to the stockades. Not the stockades... The post. No food or water. Come on! What are you looking at, boy? He was called Little Creek and he seemed different from the rest. Hey... There was just no end to the strange ways of the two-leggeds. C-Company! Ten-hut! With the Colonel's permission, Sir. Incoming patrol reports hostiles headed north. Ah. The rail road has expressed concern, Sir. They've requested additional patrols. - How long has it been, sergeant? - Sir? The mustang, how long has it been tied? Three days, Sir. Good. Fetch my crop and spurs. You can break easy or you can break hard, mustang! No! Back up! Back up! Back up! Come on! Come on! Come on... Come on... Come on, mustang! Ha! You see, gentlemen, any horse can be broken. Move along, mustang. There are those in Washington who believe the west will never be settled, the Northern Pacific Railroad will never breach Nebraska, a hostile Lakota will never submit to providence... And it is that manner of small thinking that would say this horse could never be broken. Discipline, time and patience, are the three great levelers. Sometimes a horse has gotta do what a horse has gotta do. Mustang? And this was one of those times. Oh, no! You all right, Sir? Get off me! Soldier, secure that horse! I wasn't sure what happened back there and I wasn't about to stop and ask. All I knew was that I was headed home. I couldn't believe it. One moment I was free, and the next, more ropes. Steady. Steady. I'm not going to hurt you. Nice and easy. There you go. That feels better now, doesn't it? Hey, hey! I couldn't understand it. She treated this scrawny two-legged like one of our kind prancing around him like a love-struck yearling. It was downright unnatural. Great mustang, today I will ride you. This ought to be good. Mares! Okay, Rain, let's see if you can teach this mustang some manners. Okay, I admit it, she was charming in a stubborn, irritating kind of way. So, I let her show me her world. Horsey! Mmm... Whoo! Bye-bye, horsey. For the first time in my life, I felt my heart torn two ways. Hey, hey... No! Give it back! Come on! Mustang, no! Mustang! Oh, come on. Oh... Hmm? I had to hand it to that boy, he just wouldn't give up. I'm never going to ride you, am I? And no one ever should. You can go. It's okay. Go. Go on, get out of here! Go home. I knew this was hard for her and that she was scared, but more than anything, I wanted to share my homeland with her. Ah! I lay beside her that night, hoping, praying that somehow she would be okay. There's a couple of horses over there. Leave the mare. She's not going to make it. Come on! Come on! Oh, Rain. Oh... Easy, girl. Easy. It'll be okay. Come on. Hyah, hyah. You saved my life. Two more men on that brace! Collins! Evans! Bring it down! Let's go! Jackson, grab ahold of that end! Got it! This one's loaded. I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on. It's gonna be okay. Sound the bugle now Play it just for me As the seasons change. Remember how I used to be. Now I can't go on I can't even start. I've got nothing left. Just an empty heart. I'm a soldier. Wounded, so I must give up the fight. There's nothing more for me. Lead me away. Or leave me lying here. Sound the bugle now. Tell them I don't care. There's not a road I know. That leads to anywhere Without a light, I fear that. I will stumble in the dark. Lay right down. Decide not to go on Then from on high. Somewhere in the distance There's a voice that calls. Remember who you are. If you lose yourself Your courage soon will follow. So be strong tonight. Remember who you are. Yeah. You're a soldier now. Fighting in a battle. To be free once more. Yeah, that's worth fighting for Come on. Come on now. It'll be all right. Come on. That's it. That's it. Let's go! Come on! I didn't know why we were brought here. What I did know was we had to find a way to escape and get back home. Clear! - No good! We hit bedrock! - That's it. We're hauling the steamer over the mountain. That's crazy. We got six days to connect with Utah. We move out at dawn. Ready to go! Hyah! Move it out! Move it out! Hyah! Whoa! Get back in line! We're almost at the top! Slow down up front! That was the moment I understood. They were headed to my homeland, and I had to stop them. Get back! Come on! Get back in line! It's starting to slip! Whoa! Pick up the slack! Pick up the slack! Hold it! Get the mules up here! Secure it on the left! Good work, boys! Hey! Whoa! Easy... Get him. Get him. Whoa! Hurry! Bring the poles! Hurry! - Hold him there! - Go! They're breaking! I can't hold it! Over here! Get out of the way! Holy... I don't know where he came from or how he got there but I sure was happy to see him. Whoo-hoo! Ah, ah! Oh! I knew I would find you. Halt! I don't believe it. Go, go, go, go! Run! Run! Come on, come on! Whoo-hoo! Hyah! Yeah! Whoa! That's it! Come on! Come on! Get off! Ooh! Aah! Whoa! Hyah! We got them now! Where did he go? There they are! Up there! Oh, no. Oh, yes. Whoa, oh, oh, oh. Don't judge a thing Till you know what's inside it. Don't push me, I'll fight it. Never gonna give it Never gonna give it up, no. Whoa, oh, oh, oh. Ah, if you can't catch a wave Then you're never gonna ride it. Can't come uninvited. Never gonna give it Never gonna give it up, no You can't take me. I'm free. Yeah, I'm free. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... You will always be in my heart. Take care of her, Spirit-who-could-not-be-broken. I will miss you, my friend. I had been waiting so long to run free but that good-bye was harder than I ever imagined. I'll never forget that boy... And how we won back our freedom together. I hear the wind. Call my name The sound that leads me home again. It sparks up the fire. A flame that still burns. To you I will always return. I know the road is long. But where you are is home. Wherever you stay. I'll find the way. I'll run like the river. I'll follow the sun. I'll fly like an eagle. To where I belong. I can't stand the distance. I can't dream alone. I can't wait to see you. Yes, I'm on my way home. Now I know it's true. My every road leads to you. And in the hour of darkness. Your light gets me through. You run like the river. You shine like the sun. Yeah. You fly like an eagle. Yeah, you are the one. I've seen every sunset. And with all that I've learned. Oh... It's to you I will always. Always return Here I am. This is me.
