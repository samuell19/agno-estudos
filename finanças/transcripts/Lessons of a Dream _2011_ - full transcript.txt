After a successful war against France, in 1871 the powerful German Empire was established. Left, left... left, left, left,... and halt! And one! And two! And one! 1813, the battle of Leipzig! Very good! Next. 1871, France falls to the Kaiser! Very good! Again! Football was still completely unknown at this time. The ball...high! And left. To the middle. And right. To the middle. Left --- face! And... Left, left,... left, left, left... And start! One and two and three... We are there. Haven't you heard? You can choose from... Close the bloody curtain! Thank you. Good morning. I spent the night bent over a railing. Welcome to Brunswick. Giddyup! Welcome to the Martino-Katharineum. ~ Thank you, Director. ~ Did you have a pleasant journey? The North Sea was rather rough. I welcome the fresh breeze you have brought from the island. But we haven't remained backward... since you left the Fatherland. What do you figure those men are doing out there? ~ I have no idea. ~ They're erecting telegraph poles. A few days ago I dictated a letter. You can cable one to the Imperial Education Ministry in Berlin... and we'll have an answer in our hands the same day! ~ Isn't that colossal? ~ Yes, incredible. But what use are telegraph poles to us if no one understands us? Germans expect everyone to understand German. But...they are wrong. Excuse me. And this is why I, Gustav Merfeld,... brought you, Koch, to be the first English teacher in a German school. Posterity will celebrate us as pioneers, Koch. ~ You honor me with your confidence! ~ Let's not waste time here! My secretary will take you to the lower third. Miss Salchow! ~ Not until tomorrow? ~ Hogwash! The future can't wait! By the way, classes began... 17½ minutes ago. Punctuality and discipline. Have you forgotten these German virtues? No. The lower third is an impeccable class. You should be properly informed. I'm quite pleased. Good luck. Good morning! Good morning, gentlemen. Sit down, please. ~ What is he smiling about? ~ It must be a war injury. My name is Konrad Koch. And I am your English teacher. What on Earth does that mean? ~ He's our new teacher. ~ Very good. Then I would be interested to learn what you already know about England. Yes, please. Mister? Hartung, prefect of the lower third. The English derive from primitive Celts and Anglo-Saxons. They are barbaric and want to... become an imperialist world power. Interesting. But tell me what you mean by "barbaric". Yes, please. They eat raw meat with mint sauce. They absorb other nations the negro way. They're poisoning their island with inbreeding. And they have a woman as Empress. Who told you such nonsense? I understand your nervousness at a first contact with a living foreign language. This requires from us a certain looseness. But when your German coarseness is put away,... you'll find joy in English language and culture... ~ Good morning, Dr. Bosch. ~ The same to you. Be seated. ~ Good day. ~ I'm sorry. The matter cannot wait. It was told. I would like to know right now who it was. Master Hartung, do you want to tell us something? I've seen that Joost Bornstedt has brought us a saw. ~ Empty your knapsack! ~ But I don't have a saw. ~ But it's true. ~ We've seen it. ~ There's no evidence. ~ We'll see. Hurry up, Bornstedt! ~ Keep on teaching! ~ Dr. Bosch... This isn't mine. It happened. Class assembly! Dr. Bosch, my lesson... Quiet down! People like you, Bornstedt,... have at this school... learned nothing! You've learned nothing! You're a failure! "Consilium abeundi interrogabitur." Translate, Bornstedt. "An expulsion from school will be requested." Back in the ranks. I must introduce myself. Dr. Bosch: History, Greek, Latin. Koch. Konrad Koch. English. It's your class, my colleague. Master Hartung! I guess you know where it belongs. Make sure I never see it again. You will notice I attach great importance... to the notions of "fair play and comradeship". That is fellowship. You understand that, right? Camaraderie is something very valuable. Well, yes. After you. Sit down, please! Sit down! So, here's the old caretaker's quarters. Unfortunately, the friends and patrons of the school have no better lodgings for you. Well, I think it is more than adequate and very comfortable. It's nice, you'll like it here. Shit! I forgot to mention: Director Merfeld has asked to see you again at seven... It was an accident. to join him at a reception. ~ In evening wear. ~ Good. Good day. ~ Thanks, Stollberg. ~ May it please your lordship. I finally got this bastard brought to his knees. Rosenthal is bankrupt. He's sold out. Congratulations. I also brought a swine to his knees. ~ Oh? ~ Joost Bornstedt. Has that proletarian scum finally left the school? ~ Not yet, but soon. ~ Don't boast of the victory prematurely. Otherwise, you'll not only look like a loser, but also like an idiot. ~ Mark this well. ~ Yes, Father. Well. When we get all the working class kids out of high school,... soon the socialists will all be gone,... which we've worked so hard to achieve. ~ Didn't the British teacher show up today? ~ Yes. And? How has he fit in? He calls our knowledge of the British nonsense. Nonsense? I see, I see. ~ Supplies! ~ The hatch is stuck! Well, my big boy? Hello, Mother. ~ How was school? ~ We're learning English. Really? That's great! Then you can get out of here, if you're an engineer. To America! ~ What have you got there? ~ Burns. Did you have another run-in with this Hartung? What happened? ~ Well...it's... ~ Yes? I'm going to be expelled from school. Have you lost your mind? ~ I can work in the factory. ~ Absolutely not. ~ I'll be speaking to the Director. ~ Bornstedt! What's your problem? Get back to work! You're not working in the factory. Get that through your head! Bravo! Great. Really great! I can do this myself... Leg swing, leg swing. We'll stop it. Yes, dear friends,... for 40 years now these professional politicians have been wallowing in the mud. Today... we produce the market leader in quality German products. We were the first to make medicine balls filled with lead pellets,... and we developed the first saddle... with an adjustable pommel. That thing almost cost me my manhood. It is an irony of fate that my son... presents no better figure on the high bar than a sumptuous roast suckling pig. But I will, starting today,... bring him into an active position in the business. Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome the new Junior:... Otto Leopold Schricker! Well, come on! He's still a bit shy. Give him a big hand. Great that he has a good education! Don't worry, Gustav. For all that, I prefer him as Schrickers's son with long mutton legs. We should now have a little something to eat. Your father fought in Sedan at the front, didn't he? Richard Hartung. I'm the chairman of the Foundation. ~ My son you already know. ~ Yes, we've had the pleasure. Konrad Koch. A pleasure. The birth of the Empire. The battle was certainly the most glorious in my life. I was not called to military service. I forgot. You turned your back on our homeland... and studied at Oxford, am I right? Exactly. I'm surprised at how young you are, Koch. I hope that you are aware of your responsibility. They form boys from modest men... You have their future in your hands. I can see to it that they get educated... so that their future will be in their own hands. We've heard a lot that these views are rampant... on that island recently. But you are back in the German Empire again. Here it is agreed that... that you must educate children with instruction, and discipline. Obedience and discipline are the virtues... which have brought us to where we are now. Just for a jaunty sight-read? In boys like your son there is so much talent... that we still know nothing about. We do not force them into our footsteps... lest they overtake us. Given their youthful enthusiasm, there is one thing not to forget:... you are just an experiment. The Foundation has only provisionally accept this. You should not bite the hand that feeds you. Take your father as a model:... he died in service to his country. He is a hero, your father. Above all, he is dead. My father. I'm well pleased that you've met. Mr. Hartung is the chairman of the Foundation... and it's thanks to him that you've been established here. Yes, the hand that feeds me. I am most grateful. I can't believe it! Careful, young man, careful! I forgot my key. Why beat the door because of your own forgetfulness? I guess you didn't have a good day, right? Have you ever felt unwanted? That's not one of my feelings. I've been married for 26 years. I envy you. My wife joined a club... that's agitating for women's suffrage. Next thing you know, they'll want to wear the pants. Now the door's open. Once they start to wear the trousers,... then they'll want...everything else! They'll also want to be...in the army, be the Emperor, be a general... Thank you, Pofalla. Thank you also for... Good night, Koch. The whole government...finished! "The sun." ~ "The moon." ~ Very good. ~ "The stars." ~ Not bad. ~ "The Earse." ~ The Earth. The Earth. ~ "Earse." ~ Sit down, please. You need your tongue put between your teeth. The Earth, north, south. Who wants to try it? Mr. Schwertfeger, please. "The." My tongue is too short. Very funny. Sit down. Gentlemen, you underestimate the importance of the "th". Whoever cannot master it stands there like a fool in England. Better than an idiot in front of the class. Is there something you wish to tell us, Mr. Hartung? Why is this experiment well regarded here? All we need in England is enough weapons and ammunition. But no "th". I see that my comment deserves some punishment. ~ There'll be ten whacks! ~ Twenty. They merit nothing, Mr. Hartung. Nothing at all. Who are you trying to please? Your father? He's not here. You bore me with your bloody German obedience. Be seated! Do you all think that the English language has nothing to offer you? And don't come back. We meet in exactly three minutes in the gym. Ten was closer! Give me the money! Teachers who don't hit don't count. ~ Morning, Koch. ~ Morning. See you later, Pofalla. This...is a ball. A football. Claasen? Football? That's right. A tight squeeze for a ball. And this... is a goal. A horse? So I... kick the ball... into the goal. Try it. Give it a go. Let off some steam. Hm? I kick the ball into the goal. Excellent "th". I kick the ball into the goal. Not bad. Next time use your instep. Oh, Mr. Hartung, will you have the honor? I kick the ball...elsewhere. He'll show us how it's done! I kick the ball into the goal. Very good, Mr. Bornstedt! ~ Who's next? Who's next? ~ You're not shooting. What Bornstedt can do, I can do, too. I kick the ball into the goal. Nice try. Next! ~ To shoot. ~ To shoot. ~ To pass. ~ To pass. ~ To push back. ~ To push back. ~ To block. ~ To block. ~ To defend. ~ To defend. ~ To attack. ~ To attack. ~ Go backward. ~ Go backward. ~ Go forward. ~ Go forward. ~ Once again: To shoot. ~ To shoot. ~ To pass. ~ To pass. ~ To push back. ~ To push back. Not again. Joost can't do anything else wrong. I hope not. It would be a shame. He's a good student. But he must not get more reports. ~ I understand. ~ And... I already owe money at the school beside those for the masses. Of course. It would be unfortunate if my program for "public education"... should fail at the first attempt. ~ Yes. ~ And now, excuse me. Hello? I'm looking for the emperor. The emperor? He's not here. I mean the janitor, to deal with the light well. ~ My comb... ~ The light well? Naturally. I'll take care of it. Never mind. Sorry to bother you. My pleasure. An extremely impulsive woman. Go backward. Left! Right! Go forward! Go backward! Stop! Mr. Schricker. You have not learned your vocabulary. I can't. It's my turn in "Gaul", don't you think? "Goal", Mr. Schricker. Good shot, Mr. Bornstedt. Look at the ball. Very good. To the right. Mr. Schricker, move a bit. To the right. That was the left. Left, right, right, left. A bit stronger next time. To the left! Excellent. Use your hands, Mr. Schricker. Your hands! Very good. Good! Move, don't forget to move! Very good! Very very very good, Mr. Schricker. Pass the ball! ~ Go ahead! ~ Shoot! Defend! Good sport. Left! ~ Are you hurt? ~ No, thank you. I'm fine. What was that? ~ That was a foul. ~ Yes. Protection! ~ Congratulations, Mr. Bornstedt. ~ Thank you. Man, without the free kick we would have won. Shut up! Ow! Let me go! Your British friend can't hear you! Do you think you belong here, just because you're good with the ball? You're only fooling yourself. It's only my father who keeps Koch here, and that goes for you, too. Gutter rat! Let's see how you can shoot "goals" without your shoes. ~ Well? ~ Can we skip the mumbo jumbo? Your father wants you to learn the craft from the ground up. ~ Bloody German obedience! ~ What did you say? I need a break, Tuchovsky. ~ Yes? ~ Kick it. ~ Huh? ~ But with attitude. Back to work! Can we make it smaller? And much lighter? Finally, for once you dare! Ummm... Actually, I just wanted to say that... the nature...ummm... as you see, the... I was...just checking on the linens. "Sacred flame, incandescent... "Glow and never be extinguished... "For the Fatherland. "We all are then... "with the courage of a man... "to bleed and fight on behalf of... "the throne and empire!" Thank you gentlemen. Be seated. With the imperial anthem, we promise our majesty,... to assist the German field army in its mission... with blood and iron. And we will also assist with the invasion of England. France we have brought to its knees... with 461,650 men. What sort of force do we need to deal with the English... to surprise them on the coast near "Portsmaut"? Bornstedt, of all people? Come on, I'm curious. "Portsmouth", not "Portsmaut". ~ Excuse me? ~ "Portsmouth". You have to put your tongue between your teeth: "Portsmouth". Are you crazy? Whoever cannot master the "th" stands there like a fool in England. How dare you!? Hartung! Herr Koch has led the class into such obscenities. Koch? ~ He spent three in England! ~ Four years, Otto! Who allows you to talk during the lesson? ~ Koch. He awakens the desire for indiscipline. ~ That's not true! ~ This is a lose-lose... ~ Quiet down! We all know the Imperial School Regulations, Gustav. It's not about paragraphs, but to the moral welfare of our sons. Koch talks of "Germanic boorishness". And "You bore me with..." I can translate it myself. "bloody German obedience." ~ That's treason! ~ A reason for dismissal. There's no evidence. We have to document this approach to teaching. The welfare of our children is our ultimate goal. I'm sure that Koch was an excellent choice. He has nothing to do with the rebellious children's behavior. Don't fret yourself, Koch. These gentlemen only want a clear picture... of your dedication to the authorized curriculum. ~ Where are they? ~ My God! What's going on? That's the battle of Trafalgar. When the Brits outwitted the French. He wants to open the door to our children to the enemy. But where's Nelson? And where's Koch? Maybe he visited the library with the children. He's a fine man. Hip Hip Hooray! ~ Shoot! ~ I got it! Goal! I can't breathe! I can't breathe anymore. Gustav. Your experiment in "public education" can now be put on the back burner. Bornstedt was already warned, so he's expelled. Bornstedt was under my supervision. He is excused. I take full responsibility. You mean that? Then we come to the monstrous conclusion,... that you've messed up the class with this British nonsense. ~ It's a football. ~ Football? That's not a word. I demand that this stop. This womanish kicking has no place here. Koch, you are here to teach the students the English language. It's an experiment. And I see none of that in this ball... so you need to get along without it. Football in England is a popular sport. A "Sport"? And a method of education proposed by Thomas Arnold. It's also used in other countries. Which countries might these be? ~ Holland, for example. ~ Holland? There is even evidence... that even the ancient Chinese taught with a ball. Gustav? The Chinese. Mr. Hartung, you are but a man filled with energy,... willpower and camaraderie. Koch, don't change the subject. Exactly these virtues... are developed in the game with this ball. Its spirit is motivational. They have fun in class. ~ Fun? ~ Yes, fun. Progress... Did you have fun at school? No. ~ That's why I became a teacher. ~ Richard... Mr. Koch has the best pedagogical intentions... If you believe that this country is what it is today... because we are all had so incredibly much fun, I must disappoint you. Here, a different wind is blowing. If you do not understand this,... then swim back and huddle on their damned little island! This ball disappears from your teaching at once. Otherwise you disappear. Have I made myself clear? They have forbidden it, right? I'm sorry, Gentlemen. But the German Empire feels threatened by our game. And now? Father? Thank you for having stopped all this British nonsense. ~ It was high time. ~ Yes, yes. Their language is inferior enough. Father, I will not rest... until that proletarian vanishes from the lower third. You? How? According to Dr. Bosch, you've lost your position in the class. I've instructed Stollberg... to remove this shameless person from the house. I would appreciate it... if you could keep your interest in the lower orders in check. All set. ~ Where does the landlady live? ~ Two houses down. That was good! You got the can back with your foot, like a ball. ~ What? ~ It's called a football. It's from England. ~ Joost! ~ Is that you? I'm coming! I thought you'd been expelled. Where were you? I'm on my way. ~ Yes? ~ Good evening. Can you tell me where I can find the teacher Koch? Standing before you. And with whom do I have the pleasure? ~ This is you? The teacher Koch? ~ Yes. ~ Miss... ~ Bornstedt. Joost's mother, and because of you he's been locked up. Please. I'm extremely sorry. He's almost been thrown out of school --- was that also your doing? Do you want to teach him in the factory? No. I want to teach him here. Your son shows a lot of talent. ~ For assaulting a pastor? ~ He'll get over it. He probably didn't plan on...reproducing...anyway. Don't ruin his future. I weep over... I work very hard for it. I am all for Joost's opportunities. Left! Left! And left, left,... left and left! Left and left and left... and halt! Right! And left! Left, left,... left, left! Left and halt! Left --- face! In the cupboard you can find a fork,... a spoon,... a knife,... a plate,... a cup,... a dish,... a tray,... a jar... a saucer. So, colleague. Here you go. Gentlemen. Should I just beg for your attention? As you well know, Director Merfeld has forbidden me to teach football in class. After careful consideration I have therefore come to the conclusion,... the ban will be obeyed. If you, however, decide to play football outside of class,... let me know the time and place you're meeting... It could be natural, purely by chance, that I will meet... to explain a thing or two to you. It's you decision. This works only under one condition:... we must be united. All of us. ~ Your crippled foot won't work. ~ We'll see. Who's up? Traitor. Hey, Hartung. ~ If you betray us, it's your turn. ~ Yeah? Mr. Bornstedt. ~ What have you decided? ~ The others are going to the park. The others? You're not going? ~ I heard about the football. ~ What about you? I saw the twinkle in their eyes. It'll be fun. Do you want to stop? I don't think so. If the friends and patrons are against it, I'm finished. No one learns of this. They trust their classmates. But my mother'll make mincemeat out of me. This is a serious argument. I trust her. Through the game you have earned a place and found respect in the classroom. Rich and poor play on a team. Your mother would be proud. Pity no one can learn about it. If your mother really wants to make sausages out of you, I'll talk to her. I promise. Oh... Give her this. Thanks. Where are you going now? To a working group of Dr. Bosch. Ah. Very reasonable. ~ Off you go! ~ Hup! A dump! There you are. Let's go. ~ Where? ~ I'm not saying. ~ You mean, just because I'll just tag along with you? ~ I think so. ~ Hello, Mr. Koch. ~ Good afternoon. "The lark soars into the air... "The Täublein flies out of his nest... "And ventures into the woods. "The gifted nightingale..." ~ Hello, Mr. Koch. ~ Gentlemen. Put your hats here! ~ I'm in goal. ~ I'll referee. I've brought a sentry. Gentlemen! I'm pleased that I met you here by chance. I admire your courage. Football seems to help you shed your Germanic chains. I remind you of the basic idea: no matter what happens, you play fair. ~ Hip Hip Hooray, boys! ~ Hip Hip Hooray! Kickoff! Very good, Mr. Bornstedt! Defense! Attention, Gentlemen. Fair play! Come back! Gentlemen, the playing field is here. Pass the ball! Pass! Very good. Pst, boys, boys! Gee, the fine Mr. Hartung honors us. Butthead. Good sir. ~ What are you up to? ~ Watching. ~ Don't you have to work? ~ No one will take me on. Not since your father spread dirt about me. Fair play! Pass it around! And you? What are you doing here? You're usually always busy with homework. ~ I'm prefect of this class. ~ Pass it! It's your gift for women. It's a great place. I agree. And why isn't the gracious lord playing? I organize it but can hardly keep up with the work. Mr. Zumbrink! Long balls, gentlemen. Not so much pretty, pretty stuff. Defend! Hartung, you're one too many! That's the point, eight on eight. ~ Seven against eight. ~ Eight on eight. Run! Bornstedt, run! Pass to me! Mr. Bornstedt! Mr. Schwertfeger! Mr. Bornstedt! Shoot! ~ See you tomorrow. ~ See you tomorrow. Are you busy? "Dear Ian, your parting gift is in full use. "My students play football with great joy. "If you should come on a study trip through Brunswick... "make a point of looking up your old Oxford student." ~ Tuchovsky! ~ Yes? What's all this? Suddenly, everyone here has a defect? Your son insisted on making things so small. What are these corpses? He said something about flight characteristics. Flight characteristics? Medicine balls have no flight characteristics. ~ It's a football. ~ A what? It's about this ball propelled with the foot into a "Goal". A "Goal"? What the hell is going on here? ~ I have no idea. ~ I think I do. Why do you suddenly all appear so weak and anemic in the gymnasium? I would like someone to explain what's going on. ~ A flock of sheep attacked us. ~ Silence! Zumbrink, step out! Tell me what's going on. ~ On the rings! At once! ~ But... ~ I have a sprained wrist. ~ Talk or do the gymnastics. ~ I beat him up. ~ Oh? Everyone else beat him up, too? But you're running out of air, when you should be thinking about gymnastics. To the rings! And start! ~ I can't. ~ One and two and three. That's not how to do the exercise, Zumbrink. Don't just stand there like that. Observe! Yes, what... Are you crazy? Let me down right now! Stop it! Come back! I've brought a special guest into our midst. Eugen is a retired military officer... and after leaving active duty, he has the honorable task... of promoting the importance of a military career. Please. Gentlemen. At the end of this hour you will have quite understood that:... A war is the most wonderful thing there is. They should have sent someone with two legs. I wonder if he'll play football with us? ~ Quiet! ~ Against England. Quiet! Quiet down! Dr. Jessen! Keep still! Don't even budge. Don't let them even move until the evening! Everything that happens in this classroom is your responsibility! I appreciate their progressive spirit and your willpower, but... A pioneer hanged is a useless pioneer. ~ Yeah. ~ I understand. Then I'll speak with my class and discuss my teaching methods. That sounds reasonable. A small pinch of authority hasn't really hurt us all that much, has it? Gentlemen, he has promised to rein them in. You don't believe this tea-drinker? How long shall we put up with this? There is a revolution in progress. Don't you think this could have happened without Koch? Never! He corrupted the students' thoughts. I know it. And they play this game in secret. The Imperial School Regulations unfortunately say nothing... against misconduct outside the academic sphere. I've had enough. If you can't maintain order,... I'll take matters into my own hands. The Foundation will no longer sanction your pedagogical experiments. After all, only nonsense results. ~ I fear we lack the evidence. ~ He'll make a mistake. ~ Keep your eyes open. ~ Yes. My son is enthusiastic about your working group. Thank you, Mr. Hartung, but what group do you mean? Where were you? Have you taken to this Rosalie? You're throwing your life away. Do you think that this damsel loves you? I'll have her shipped off to East Prussia! From there she won't be able to mess with your head. So where is the bitch? Where? I haven't seen her since she left the house. Where were you then? Playing football in the park. I see. Now you feel better, huh? Wipe your face. This doesn't look nice. Good morning. Good morning. Sit down, please. ~ He's not smiling. ~ Where is Mr. Hartung? ~ I know where he's had some small influence. ~ A small part. Director Merfeld has described an incident in history lessons. You call this a history lesson? I thought you had this virtue of football already internalized. Mr. Claasen, please. "Fair play" refers to the respectful treatment... toward the enemy and each other. Is there anyone who believes your behavior towards a soldier... who has lost his leg was fair? Which of you believes this? Gentlemen. Beg your pardon from this soldier and from Dr. Bosch. ~ Why? ~ What for? ~ What? ~ Apologize. ~ Until you do, our practice will be suspended. ~ What? ~ What? ~ You can't do that! Quiet, please! Open your books. Page 21. Who is reading? Mr. Zumbrink, please. Who's for the apology? How about we play football today without Koch? ~ Koch got it right somehow. ~ Right? Will you go to Bosch and apologize? You? ~ No. ~ Good. Gentlemen, see you in the park. Where are you going? You're not going to play this game again? Mother, you should go and watch some time. You'd be proud. I'm the best in the class. The others finally respect me. In football, it does not matter if you're rich or poor. That doesn't help you if you're booted out of the school. In real life, it DOES matter whether you're rich or poor. But you want to be an engineer! No, I will not! I don't want to go to America! That's YOUR dream! I want to stay and play football. Joost! ~ What the hell?! ~ Penalty! That wasn't a foul! ~ I saw it! ~ You see everything, Fatso? You morons! Listen to me! The friends and the patrons. Let's scram. You traitor! You sneak! Prepare to bring this British disease to an end! You can't escape! ~ Hartung can't see me! ~ I'll help you. Let me go! Good luck! Freeze! I surrender! My life for football! The proletarian. That was that. So these are the "Goals". Unbelievable, what emotional outbursts they create in the child. Looks like two bars, driven into the ground. The proletarian had the ball, he's the ringleader. These are the beginnings a socialist revolution. This game promotes the decay and the brutalization of youth. Besides, it's forbidden. I have forbidden it, but obviously... I don't know where they got the ball. I knew immediately that you were a coward. No sense of honor. No responsibility. As soon as your homeland needed you, you disappeared. Richard! This Joost Bornstedt must finally be reported to the school. It's him who's the leader behind this footballing nonsense. I offer my resignation. Under the condition that Mr. Bornstedt remain at the school. I take full responsibility. Let's be honest. It would be most convenient for all concerned, wouldn't it? That the tea-drinker disappears. Don't blame yourself. What my father did...what happens now? They have banned football in the Duchy of Brunswick. ~ They can't do that. ~ Your father can. You have to leave? The game got out of control. I'm such a stupid traitor. ~ I didn't want that, but my... ~ I know. Nobody beats so hard as one's own father. I had my father in the classroom. But you didn't betray anyone. In your situation, I would have. I wanted to be better than my father. Well, you can see what's come to pass. It's not the end of the world, Felix. "Dear Ian,... "when you get here to Brunswick,... "I'm no longer at Martino-Katharineum. "It would have been a great match. "But unfortunately, things have taken a hopeless turn." ~ Fortunately, you're still here. ~ "Fortunately"? ~ Are you deranged? ~ How dare you... Football is prohibited in Brunswick. Koch must go. ~ Is Claasen there? ~ Here. ~ What's that? ~ The Imperial School Regulations. Read section 34, paragraph 3. ~ Is the school on fire? ~ It's a matter of life and death! Tell that to the Sandman. Excuse me,... but we didn't know who else to turn to. Yes, please? ~ I'm looking for the emperor. ~ Mrs. Bornstedt. ~ Come in. ~ Thank you. Director Merfeld told me everything you did for Joost. Thank you. I don't know how I'll ever repay you. Without me he would never have come so far. I overestimated my abilities... and underestimated German stubbornness. So now you're going back to England? I envy you. You can go everywhere. The world is your oyster. But it's good to know where you belong. Maybe we'll see each other again. You must sign here. I must not say how very much we regret it. No, you don't have to. A telegram for you, Director. From Berlin. From the Imperial Ministry of Education. It's important. Well... This changes the situation enormously. Dear Richard, this is an answer to a request... I sent yesterday to Berlin. ~ What kind of request? ~ Well... Well...in reference to paragraph... ~ 34. ~ 34... I have a... they're evaluating the request. An Imperial delegation will examine football... so it can be introduced as a supplement to course content. Football as a teaching component? You'll agree with me, I'm sure,... that an Imperial delegation shouldn't be trifled with. I suggest that up until the arrival of this delegation... that the ban on further football activities... for the lower third be lifted. I cannot avoid responsibility in the face of the emperor's government. Or do you want the students... I apologize to Mr. Koch. We must make preparations. Miss Salchow. That has had a lot of use in the last few days... contact with the Imperial Education Ministry? I want to know right smartly whose idea this was! Mine, Director. Excuse me? That's not entirely accurate. I coerced him into it. Then I really pushed him into it. Actually, it was all of our idea. Thank you. It was also always the idea of... Well, he's a genius! Well done, boys. Very well done. Gentlemen, I am proud of you. You are now a real team. And now imagine,... that every village in the German Empire could have a team,... and they'd play against each other. In England there are already tournaments every Sunday,... eagerly attended by thousands. Could this also be possible in Germany? It's in your hands, to convince the delegation. With this game you can do anything, win or lose! On your marks! Well? If the delegation goes for it, you can't stop the game. The players need Koch. Do you want to imprison them all? I have a better idea. Don't dribble. Pass! Cover him! Terrific! No, no, no! Rodenstock, "Braunschweiger Zeitung". Don't mind us. Take a picture. "Braunschweiger Zeitung"! We must not let... our children be tempted into this game! It is barbaric and unnatural. Football now is now strictly forbidden! But if the delegation votes for it... soon every school will be playing football. And then what do we do? Prosthetic legs and wheelchairs. You're throwing me out? Where will I go? That's not my problem. You can work on the streets. You don't understand. It's over! ~ You've got to go help Rosalie! ~ Rosalie? What about her? ~ Come on! ~ Felix! What's going on? Felix! Felix! You can't force me to do anything! ~ Are you hurt? ~ I'm all right. Rasch, a doctor. Hey, get yourself out of here! That's that, Koch. And Gustav...while we're at it... All your unnecessary experiments at this school are to finish. First it affected Pastor Werners, then my son. He will not inflict even more evil. Bornstedt gets kicked out today! Mr. Bornstedt? Can I have a brief word with you? They've tossed me out, right? Yes. I'm very sorry. Keep your ears up, you guys. ~ I'm going, too. ~ They'll throw you out, too! I don't care. ~ Friends of shit! ~ They're to blame! ~ Let them die! ~ Gentlemen. You need to know when you've lost. You take care of yourselves. You're still a team. "Should auld acquaintance be forgot... "And never brought to mind? "And never brought to mind? "Should auld acquaintance be forgot... "And days of auld lang syne? "For auld lang syne, my dear... "For auld lang syne... "We'll take a cup of kindness yet... "For auld lang syne... "For auld lang syne, my dear..." "For auld lang syne... "We'll take a cup of kindness yet... "For auld lang syne..." Goodbye, my friend. ~ Brave Pioneer. ~ Bye. The battlefield was soaked with blood. But Clausewitz knew he had no choice. He said to his adjutants... ~ He's leaving! ~ Sit down! Sit down immediately! "Send her victorious, Happy and glorious "Long to reign over us, God save the Queen!" ~ Ian, what are you doing here? ~ I've come to play football. ~ Where's your team? ~ My team? He said to his adjutants... The Emperor's Hymn. The delegation's arriving. Sound off! "Warriors and heroes... "you will find your laurels... "loyal to this throne..." "Confound their politics, frustrate their knavish tricks... "Wave our flag boldly on the high seas!" ~ What's going on here? ~ He's back! May I introduce you to a couple of friends? ~ Yeah! ~ Silence! Anyone in the mood for some bloody football? Yeah! What did he say? ~ You don't have a chance! ~ Sit down! Sit down at once! Against the English is a matter of life and death! Anyone who leaves this room, is expelled from school! Everyone! Anyone who leaves this room, is expelled from school! ~ Koch. ~ You didn't receive my letter? Have you considered the consequences? This violates the laws of Brunswick! Whether this request becomes a matter of law should be left to the delegation. Please listen up. Today you all have a free day. Therefore, I expect you all to go at once to the city park. Everyone has a free day? Not you --- you have to sell footballs. If you lose money, every mark comes out of your allowance. ~ Agreed? ~ Agreed. Didn't you hear him? Move out! Come on, what are you waiting for? Tuchovsky? Where are these balls?? The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face shine and be gracious unto you. The Lord lift up His face on...you... They're taking on the English. In city park! May the Lord God protect our troops on the battlefield. Amen. We're playing against the English. Let's go. "Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres." Gaul is in... Felix, we need you! ~ Where are you going? ~ To play football. Go to your room at once. Hurry! Move! ~ Heinrich, come on! ~ Wait for us! Wait! Schricker, faster! You can look but don't touch anything, all right? You now only have one task: convince the delegation! Play, boys, play your best! ~ Hip Hip Hooray, boys! ~ Hip Hip Hooray! Hip Hip Hooray! The left wing! Watch out! Defense! ~ Guys, defend! ~ Oh, what a shame! Block him! ~ To the right! ~ Shoot! Oh! We must never allow this game! This is anarchic! ~ Ungymnastic. ~ UnGerman. Defense! Was that a goal? What? Shift! ~ Goddamnit ~ No, that was offside. When a player is ahead of the opponents... and his teammates play him the ball from behind him,... he can't touch the ball or prevent the opponents from playing it. There must always be... two opponents ahead of him. Yes. ~ Cover him! ~ Joost! Yes! ~ Sensational! ~ Amazing! Isn't that Hartung's son? Hey, look at that! For your little brother! ~ Father, sell them for five marks. ~ Just five? All right, Junior. Hands off, please. ~ A ball, please! ~ I'll take two. Next!? The young lady? Come on, guys! Watch out! Next! Quickly! Watch out, pass! Go! ~ Good day. ~ Good day. Has Joost's future been put at risk? Before you tear me to pieces: I'm sorry. It's better if you don't say anything. Go, go, go! Go on, shoot! Yes! Goal! Yes! ~ Class! ~ Goal! Two to one! Sensational! What a great game! And I second that --- seven times! How do you have faith, that everything will always work out for the good? This time I'm not so sure. Maybe the game's too barbaric for this country. Konrad Koch and his students began a movement in 1875 to bring football to Germany. It spread throughout the German Reich. In many regions students and teachers were still banned from playing... Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player
