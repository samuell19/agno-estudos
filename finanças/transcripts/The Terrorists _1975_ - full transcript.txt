Yes, that is undeniably correct. And in our country... Yes, Minister. We must dispose of the problem as soon as possible. Well, I agree, but we... As soon as possible. Yes, I agree, but the British have told us nothing. This is a terrible situation. It is, indeed, a grave situation. A very grave situation. Ah... Minister, I am aware of that... Then act accordingly. Yes, sir. Captain Barnes, the Minister, as you've no doubt gathered, is extremely disturbed... he feels this situation is getting out of hand, and I'm bound to say I agree with him for once. This is not the sort of behaviour we expect from a friendly government. Indeed, I shall go so far as to say... Mr Bernhard. We have found out who the man is. He's the leader of a terrorist group in England. During the past few years he's been responsible for the killing of almost one hundred people. His name is Martin Shepherd. Obviously he's not a hot-headed student. He's a professional... highly organised. Yes, yes, even in Scandinavia we've heard of Martin Shepherd... Captain, I don't wish to make your position any more intolerable than it is already. But Shepherd has held the British Ambassador at gunpoint since yesterday. Now, I understand that you visited with these terrorists and had conversations with them at seven o'clock this morning... and I am asking you formally to tell me what you know about this kidnapping. I recorded this earlier today. The London police are holding five of my associates. If the British Government wish to secure the release of their Ambassador to Scandinavia... they must free these men, and arrange safe conduct for them to Amsterdam. When these terms have been complied with, you will place a military aircraft at my disposal... and provide me with parachutes. If you do not meet these terms within twelve hours... I shall execute one of the hostages. I shall then repeat exactly these same demands. You see now why London had to know who they were dealing with. He will do what he says. And now that they've found it's Shepherd, what has London decided? They will release Shepherds men. They have, in fact, agreed to everything. Not even token resistance... Captain? The British Government will not sacrifice the life of its Ambassador! Well, you must do as you think best. This is a British affair. Not ours. That isn't quite everything, Mr Bernhard. Can we rely on your co-operation in the matter of the parachutes and aircraft? Do we have a choice? I'll recommend that you get all the assistance you need. My government is anxious to dispose of this problem. Thank you, sir. I must be getting back to the Ambassador's house. Our Head of Security, Colonel Tahlvik, will be briefed as soon as possible. You know Tahlvik, of course. Nils Tahlvik and I are old friends. He will regard this as a surrender, you know, and he won't like that. I have my orders, Mr Bernhard. Of course. The atmosphere is still tense here at the British Ambassador's residence in the mountains. Some of the local people are still waiting around to see what happens... and after several hours of inactivity there's a development at last. Captain Barnes is now approaching the house for a third meeting with the gunmen. With him for the first time, perhaps significantly, is the Scandinavian Head of Security, Colonel Tahlvik. Hands on the wall. This is Colonel Talhvik, he's in charge of Security. I know who he is. Stay where you are. Are you all right, sir? Yes, thank you, Frank. What's the decision? Well? London has agreed. - To what? - Everything. All charges against your people have been dropped. They were released from custody and flew out of England an hour ago for Amsterdam. You understand, of course... we won't be moving out till I verify that they're safe. That is understood. In the meantime, you'll deliver the parachutes. The Ambassador will be dropping with us, so don't try any tricks. The Ambassador will bale outwith you? Palmer will be left at the dropping zone. After we've landed and are clear you'll be told where that is. I shall be all right, Colonel Tahlvik. I have no war with sick old men. What about this end? You'll get what you need. A minibus will take you from here to the airport. The Government has placed a Hercules at your disposal. A Hercules will do- Right. That's all. Wait. What about the servants? They return with the plane. No. They return with the plane. They do not go on board the plane. You will release them at the airport... or you can stay here and rot. So far, so good. You call total surrender good? We don't surrender, Nils; Shepherd does. London called. We know where he's going to bale out. I'm sorry, Nils. Sorry? I should have told you we knew about Marigold. Knew about what? The place where they're going to bale out. Marigold - it's a code name. I should have told you before we went in. I'm sorry. You were right not to tell me. If I'd known, I might have said something... got them suspicious. I might. Regular Air Force issue, no problem. Good. It's time to call Amsterdam. Shepherd planned them all every one. Why isn't he in prison? No evidence. Shepherd doesn't leave any. He's been making fools of the police for years. But now we have him. I've got his voice on tape. On my evidence he'll go to prison for the rest of his life. Oil refineries, power stations blown up. Telephone exchanges destroyed. Two British airports bombed, arterial roads sabotaged. To date, one hundred innocent people killed. I'm calling Amsterdam 64237115. Who are you? This is Sunflower. Are you safe? Hello, Sunflower. It worked like a dream. - Good. - We're all here. You know what to do. Split up and be careful. As soon as you release the hostages the police will be looking for you. We're moving out now - from this moment, you're on your own. We shall drop as arranged. Marigold will go ahead as planned. We understand, Sunflower. Good luck. We've got him! Ladies and gentlemen... in a few moments we shall be landing. Kindly observe... are securely fastened and that your seats... are in an upright position. Thank you. Tower from Mike Tango Oscar. We have the runway in sight. We clear to land? Mike Tango Oscar, all clear to land. Wind two four zero degrees, five knots. Mike Tango Oscar. I'm sorry, sir, but you must remain in your seat. Sir! Take me to the Captain. Air speed - plus five. Captain Denver... your aircraft is wired up to explode. You will do exactly as I say. Now, when we touch down, I want you to come to rest on the runway furthest from the terminal buildings. Air speed - plus eight. Mike Tango Oscar. Landing time three zero, you're cleared in first taxiway right, parking Golf Three. There's some smoke from your main landing gear. Mike Tango Oscar, Tower. Do you read? Alert the fire station. Fire station on standby. Tango Oscar, do you read? Crash alarm. Crash alarm. Mike Tango Oscar. Tower, do you read me? Get over to that far runway. I say again... Mike Tango Oscar, do you read me? Mike Tango Oscar, negative. Left turn, turn to the right. All clear? Clear right-hand side. Well, that's as far as it'll go. He took off the anti-skid. Now, that, Captain, will be your last deliberate mistake. I can't think straight with a gun in my neck. Oh, you'd better learn to. Now, listen. There are four of us and we're all wearing these. I press that... and this plane goes up in two seconds. And you with it. That's right. Any whiff of gas through the air intake, any smart-alec trick like that, and I detonate. Now, get control and tell them what's happened, and let me speak to them. Get the Inspector. Sir. Shepherds coming out in sixty seconds. Now, move. Right, sir. Stand by, Tower. - Tower? - Tower here. 53-57-78. No questions, no debates - do it. Right, now, let's move out. Walk normally. Don't rush, just get into the van. Hello. Sunflower, this is Petrie. Marigold is blown. They know about Marigold. The police know where the dropping zone is. Petrie - where are you? I'm here - at the airport. I've hijacked a plane to get you out. Stay where you are. Do not leave the Ambassador's house. How the hell did they blow Marigold? The pigs have got Chris. They're warming all over Marigold waiting to get you. Understood, Ray. Thank you. Just sit tight. Back into the house! Get back into the house! Come on! Come on! What's gone wrong? Close the gates. The police are waiting for us at the other end. What the hell do we do?! We're not going to crack just because the police have got lucky for once. - How did they find out? - Quiet! How'd they find out... What the hell do we do? I don't know... and I don't care. We keep our heads. Someone has come to get us out. Petrie has hijacked a plane. He's at the airport. You can trust him. He knows what he's doing. We sit tight. We've just got to hold out and make sure that if anybody breaks it's them, not us. - Right. - Right. This is where it starts to get difficult. You've lost the initiative. You are forced, to rely on someone else. That isn't difficult. You don't think so? Waiting... that's the worst part. Is it? We've been waiting for the last two days. We've weathered that. Yes... but then, your fate was in your own hands. Now you have to rely on someone called Petrie. He makes one mistake... and you are dead, my friend. We are dead... my friend! Despite the rocky landing, this plane is quite safe. You are in no danger. The Captain removed the anti-skid device, and has blown all the tyres. This means that the wheels will have to be replaced before the plane can take off again. We are therefore obliged to detain you on board for the time being. If you look round, you will see three men standing in the gangway. If you obey their instructions... keep calm... and remain seated... we are confident that we shall be able to release you all within a few hours. Don't give them anything until I get there. I want to know where the flight originated, stopovers, if any. I want to know how many passengers are on board. What name did he give? - Ray Petrie - Petrie...? Ray Petrie? Tahlvik. General. You know Bernhard from the Ministry of the Interior? You're going to the airport? Yes. The hijackers wish to exchange the passengers for the terrorists in the British Ambassador's house. Now, it's the Government's view that we yield to their demands. We do not wish to be involved in the domestic politics of other nations. If we give in now we'll have another hijack next week... and the week after. We'll become a soft touch for any blackmailer who's prepared to use this kind of... piracy. If we try to resist, a hundred innocent people might well be blown to pieces. We couldn't justify such bloodshed. In a situation like this the Government is powerless. There's another important fact we must not forget. What is that, General? There's an election coming up. Our national security becomes a farce if we throw away the rule of law. This isn't a war game, Colonel Tahlvik. There isn't any acceptable level of casualties. Absolutely right, Bernhard. Captain Barnes! Tahlvik, politicians and civil servants hate to be argued with. I never do it. As a result, they do exactly what I want. The Ambassador was a British affair; this hijack is ours. Here are your orders. You will delay our surrender to the last possible moment. You will try to overcome the hijackers. In doing so... you will not endanger the life of a single passenger. Is that clear, Tahlvik? Perfectly clear, sir... and quite impossible. Good. We understand each other. I have a strong aversion to a bunch of foreign anarchists holding the country to ransom. And Bernhard? Try diplomacy. If that fails - improvise. You're in charge, Tahlvik. Drink? Take it. Do you want some sweets? You too? Yes take one. Take one. I say... isn't anyone going to do anything? Like what? Good God, man, we can't all just sit here! We've been hijacked... Hey! Hey, are you onto have a go? Have... a... go! You forgot to tell the passengers the plane is wired to explode. I didn't forget. Are you going to tell them? Captain, I have every intention of avoiding panic back there. At the moment most people don't even know what's going on. I intend to feed them just enough information to keep them settled. No rough stuff, keep them informed, and they won't be a problem. And you're not going to be a problem either, are you Captain? You seem to be in command. That's right. Now, refuel and supplies for a six-hour flight. Right. Oh - and the tyres. We need a special jack to change all the wheels. You should've thought of that before you removed the anti-skid device. I did. Get one. Anything else? Such as? A flight plan to Cuba? All in good time, Captain. All in good time. Well, what do we do? We do exactly as he says. You know our policy. This man's a... professional. From London...? Get the airline to Telex the passenger list through to the Control Tower. What did Bernhard say back there? I think he was trying to summarise the duties of a military attache. You mean, keep out of it? He's not very keen on the military, is he? Who is? What did the General want? He wants us to do the impossible. Sign here... Are you in charge of these men? Who the hell are you? Only swear at people, Inspector, when you know that you outrank them. I'm Colonel Tahlvik. I'm in charge. Get these rifles out of sight. I was following routine procedure. How many hijacks have you dealt with? This is the first. The first. So don't let's talk about “routine procedure”, hm? It's also my first... so I shall need all the help I can get. Matson? Yes. Head of the Airport Authority. All right, Matson, I want this tower cleared of everyone and everything but essentials. I want to speak to the pilot. Here's a blanket, sir. Thank you. I'm afraid I cannot allow the doors to be closed, but if you'd all like to move further back in the plane, you'll be much warmer. Come on, back we go. I shall stay where I am. Now, so far, I've seen two men, but I'm told there are four. They seem to be going about it pretty professionally. The passengers are quiet, Colonel Tahlvik. Stand by, Tower. Tahlvik...! Who's this? I asked for refuelling. Now, where is it? It's in hand. Let's start by cutting out the bullshit. One - we need fuel for a six-hour flight. Two - we need drinking water. Three - we need a special jack and a new set of wheels because... Captain Denver here deliberately sabotaged the plane on landing. Now, you have until five thirty. There will be no extension to this deadline. Do you read me, Tahlvik? Tahlvik! I'm going to lunch. If this plane is not ready to leave by five thirty with my friends on board, it goes up. And you will be to blame, Colonel Tahlvik. Shall I close down the airport? No, no, keep it open. Denver's right - he's a professional. Why couldn't we get a nice simple basket case? What about the jack? We haven't got one. Why not? There's never any call. Well, there is now. Try the military... but, uh... get it. It'll take time. Take all the time you want - as long as it's here within two hours. Frank, get onto Scotland Yard - Special Branch people. Check out this Ray Petrie. I'd like to know who we're dealing with. Know if anyone's in there? Oh... So sorry... get out of your way... Okay. NO! And you let a fool like that take you? Go on. And stay in there! Ladies and gentlemen, we have had one man trying to play the hero. I must therefore warn you... we can destroy this plane in one second. All of you and ourselves. And we will if we have to. So, please - no more heroes. He's regarded as somewhat of a national hero. His decision today to keep the airport open will be regarded as controversial. But Colonel Tahlvik is no stranger to controversy. In 1968, serving on a peace-keeping force in Cyprus, he caused an international incident when he arrested some prominent politicians for smuggling arms. “We cannot throw away the book of rules just because it suits us to do so. This applies both to individuals and to governments.” Despite the uproar then, Tahlvik maintained that since the politicians had broken the law, they must face the consequences. There he is - over there. Colonel Tahlvik is married with two children. He is a keep-fit enthusiast and is a former cross-country skiing champion. His appointment as Head of Security was rumoured to have been opposed by the Ministry of the Interior; it's said that the Ministry wanted a civilian in the job. The Government's decision to release the gunmen holding the British Ambassador couldn't have been welcomed by this uncompromising man. And now, placed in charge... Colonel Tahlvik - Mrs Palmer. I was out of the house when it happened, and the police have refused... I saw the Ambassador this morning. He's well. He's not well, Colonel. My husband is dying. His heart... he's living on borrowed time. He has a year to live. He knows about it. He has a year... if he avoids any kind of strain. Well, we are doing what we can... No, you're not. He's already been held hostage for two whole days. And now there'll be more delays - more waiting more strain which he cannot endure! Colonel... in thirty years as a diplomat's wife I have never broken the rules of the game. But I am breaking them now. I'm begging you to let these men go. They're killing my husband as surely as if they were putting a rope round his neck. Let them go. They'll be caught somewhere, somehow! Let them go from here! I couldn't stop her, Nils. Petrie wants a two-way police radio for himself and Shepherd. Give Shepherd his - but hold on to Petrie's till I tell you, and get one for me. Meanwhile, let us ask some of the members of the public how they would want the authorities to handle this hijack. Oh, and Matson - I'd like an office. Anything will do. Yes. I don't see any problem really, you know, I mean, we just... get rid of these foreign gangsters, and we... save the lives of innocent bystanders, y'know? I mean, er, there's no problem... I don't think so, anyway... Denver says they're stiff with guns. What the hell is London Airport doing? What kind of security are they carrying out? Hm? Check if they're using Magnetometers, will you? Yes, all right. Go on, now. Well, now, Nils. Well? Thousand to one. What odds do your men accept? Two thousand to one. How many commados did you bring? Ten. Fetch me your best man. Okay. What time is it... please? Nearly two. We'd counted on being out of here by now. Do you need the pills? No... they're for an emergency. You put one between my teeth. It wouldn't be very convenient for you, would it, if my heart were to give out now? We still have your housekeepers. Policeman coming. It's a radio! - Petrie. - Hello Your radio's coming out. Let the women and children off, Petrie. At least you can do that. No. Good God, man, show some mercy. It's up to you, Tahlvik. Give us our comrades, and everyone gets off. What guarantees do I have you'll keep your word? Well, none... you're going to have to trust me. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hello, Sunflower. Message. Over. Hullo, Sunflower. Send your message. Over. The pilot, screwed up the wheels on landing. They have to be changed. How long will it take? I've got it in hand - no sweat. Keep on this frequency. Out. Colonel Tahlvik! What are you trying to do? - Get her out of here. - Come on... They'll kill my husband if you try to stop them! They'll kill everyone! Post a man outside that door. And no-one comes in here unless I say so, is that clear? Denver. Captain, how are you? Alone, Colonel. One of my men is under your forward hold. Bring him in when you can. Tower... I'm getting quite warm now. I can confirm that the, uh, auxiliary power is working normally. Mm - things are hotting up quite nicely. Captain Denver... You're a very lucky man. You might've been hurt. Tahlvik...? Yes? I promise you, Tahlvik, the next one you send will die. This is Captain Barnes of the British Embassy. We are negotiating the release of your men with the authorities. But I warn you... They will refuse outright if you cause any loss of life. Is that clear? It's clear to me. But is it clear to Tahlvik? You tell him. Base here... the low-profile jack you requested will be sent as soon as possible. - Donner. - I've located the jack, Colonel. Good. Your best man, and they saw him all the way. Impossible. Then what went wrong? He kept to the blind side. They couldn't have seen him. Someone did. Yes... bunker. There's someone out there. Journaliste! Paris Match... Journaliste! Paris Match... My camera... There's someone out there somewhere, telling them every bloody move we make. Have the police search every building that overlooks the airfield. The lot. Big place. Colonel Tahlvik, it's just come to my attention that you are wilfully disobeying your orders... and in doing so you've almost killed a hundred passengers. I'm on my way to the airport and I'm telling you now to start carrying out the instructions you've been given. D'you understand, Tahlvik? Do I make myself clear? There is to be no further... He's in the tunnel. Donner. I hope you agree Colonel, that there is only one way to handle this situation, and that is to do nothing rash. Colonel, you want the whole airport searched? Yes. At the very least it'll take five hours. Well, that's no good. I'm sorry, but you appreciate the area and the buildings involved. I must find that look-out before Shepherd gets here. Yes. We'll have to narrow down the area of search. Where is Colonel Tahlvik. No-one goes in there. My name is Bernhard. I am from the Ministry of the Interior. I don't care who you are. Would you please go inside and inform him that I'm here. I can't do that. Orders. Try it. I've always wanted to punch one of you people. Captain Barnes. Excuse me. I insist on seeing Colonel Tahlvik. There's a Petrie down here. Yes, I'm waiting to hear if London know anyone of that name. There's three others with him. See if London can identify any of the other passengers. Forget the women and children. Prune it down. Use your head. Yes? The jack has arrived, Colonel. Good. Keep it out of sight. And Matson... I'm expecting a call from Petrie. - Keep the channel free. - Right. Tahlvik? Yes? What the hell do you think you're playing at? Pull those troops back. They get anyway near us and I'll blow this plane up. You think I'm kidding, then try it. Tahlvik, do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. I'm pulling them back. And what about this bloody jack? Won't be long now. Better not be. You have two hours. The sneaky bastard... Matson. Have the jack sent out now. You are, I take it... the people who caused so much trouble in Britain, these past few years. The sabotage, and the killing... Of which you disapprove? That is self-evident. You served four years with Tito's Partisans in Yugoslavia. Your job, I assume, was to sabotage and to kill. But that was war. So is this. You were fighting to destroy a system you considered evil, of which you disapproved. So am I. And what do you intend... after you have destroyed it? I shall stop fighting. That's self-evident. Get Petrie. Hallo, Sunflower. Message. Over. Sunflower, send your message. Over. We're coming out now. We have three hostages who will bring us to you. Over. Wait. The wheels still have to be replaced. Listen, Sunflower, leave it a bit longer until we're ready to take off. Right now, we're stronger apart. I'm your insurance... you're mine. Okay? Right. That's the right one... special low-profile jack. Hallo, Tango Victor X-ray. I can't see anybody, Colonel. - Park at the end of the line. - Wilco. He's in one of those aircraft. They've got another plane out there. I think they must be onto me. I'm taking off now. Good luck. They're on to George. He's leaving us. You know what to do. I'm following him, Colonel. Tahlvik! So you got rid of my look-out. Big deal. Well, where the hell d'you think that's got you? At five-thirty I blow this plane up. And then there'll be no-one for you to play soldiers with Colonel. Hm. Now, keep your eyes open. Victor X-ray. Go ahead, Colonel. Check his registration. Wilco. He's good. So are you... and you're faster. He'll be off-radar in the mountains. I want to know where he lands. Wilco. I'm closing in, Colonel. His registration is... Bravo - India - Mike. Matson, find out who owns that plane. I'll check it with the Aviation Registry, Colonel. He's flying in a circle. India Mike is owned by Nordair. They've leased it to a British pilot. Name? George Rawlings. And he's British. Get on to Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard - Criminal Record Office. Er, Matson, Chief of Scandinavian Airport Authority here. Check, please, on George Rawlings. Holder of Pilot's Licence No. AJ6 656571B. He must be heading for Lake Blufell. It's the only place he can land on skis. How far is that? About eight minutes. Colonel, he's heading north... 30 degrees east. It must be Lake Blufell. Scotland Yard have a file on George Rawlings. Contact the police... in the Lake Blufell area. They have seven minutes. Thank you, Victor X-ray. Return to base. Keep tracking him. Let me know. Tahlvik... Not now, Bernhard. I've - er - ahem - heard from London. Oh, yes? Do you want to hear it? Mm. Number one - London Airport have not only had all their Magnetometers going full blast... but since the Ambassador was taken hostage, anyone coming here has been stripped naked. Number two? Number two - Scotland Yard have known about someone called Petrie for two years. They know he's involved with Shepherd's group but, like Shepherd he's never been arrested. Well, now... He must be rather clever. He must also be rather lucky. He travels under his own name... He just walks through the tightest security checks... Takes a plane to a place where his friends are holding the British Ambassador to ransom... It's a most extraordinary thing, certainly. Brings an arsenal of guns, enough explosive to blow up the plane... he isn't just lucky, Frank, he's a walking bloody miracle. It is rather odd. It didn't take Colonel Tahlvik very long to discover just how many British pilots there are who have a criminal record... and not a very good record. Mr Rawlings... there's one aspect of your career which intrigues me. Oh, yeah? What's that, then? Two years ago you were arrested in the Persian Gulf, having flown an aircraft from India which had been involved in gold smuggling. I think you'll find I was never charged with that of fence. And you can check that outwith whoever you like. Exactly. Joe! Thirty minutes. Your time's up, Tahlvik. The wheel's will be ready in thirty minutes, and if my friends are not on board by that time, the plane and the passengers will be blown up. I'm waiting, Tahlvik. Your friends will be released. They will have safe conduct to the airport. Hallo. Sunflower? Hallo, Petrie, this is Sunflower. What's happening? Ready and waiting. Come on in, brother. You have safe conduct all the way. I don't need safe conduct. I'm bringing the hostages. Out. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to tell you that the authorities have co-operated. You should therefore be free to leave this plane in about thirty minutes. Thank you, for your patience. Gold smuggling... and they dropped the charges. Why would they do that? Because they got something in return. Who are “they”? The British. Thank you. You are... who? British Embassy, sir. Papers. Out. What are you doing here? Waiting to deliver diplomatic mail to the Queen's Messenger. He's on that plane, sir. Usually he drops incoming mail and picks up the outgoing- - those. But now... And where do you exchange these things? On the tarmac. The Queen's Messenger belongs to the Diplomatic Corps. I pick him up by the plane. That's the rules, sir. What's the name of this, er, Queen's Messenger? Brigadier Hislop. Colonel Tahlvik... In thirty-five minutes' time that plane will explode. Precisely, Colonel. You've spent hours ignoring your orders, and the result is we're facing our deadline. You've had a good run, Tahlvik. You've made your point. I'm not hereto make points. I'm here as Head of Security. Unless you transfer the terrorists to the aircraft at once, I'm going to relieve you of your command. Transfer began ten minutes ago. Travelling in a light-blue minibus... with you in ten minutes. Sunflower... Maintain contact until you get here. Proceeding. No difficulty. Okay. Hello, Petrie... hello, Petrie. Pull over... Come on... Cover him! Move it What's happening? Right... move it... hurry it up! Come in, Sunflower! Where are you, Sunflower? Where are you? Sunflower... Sunflower, where are you? Come on in... come in. Went through a tunnel. Can you hear me? Okay. Hear you fine now. Come on in. Hello, Petrie. Hello, Petrie. Damn! Mike... get out there! Get that truck moving! Come on, hurry up! Let me do it. Sit down! Sit down, love... stay in your seat. Stay there. Control them, will you? Hello, Petrie... We are inside the perimeter now. Drive right up to the steps. This is it. Tower from Tango Oscar. The bus is here but I still haven't been told where we're going. Have you any idea? They've been switched! Did they hear? We were lucky. We heard, but no-one else did. Get rid of that bus, Mike. Right, Ray. I'll do it now. Leave it to me. Okay, let's go, let's go. Get it moving. Shut it! Captain Denver! She gets it first! Denver! Well, Colonel, you seem to have done it - except that... one of them has a gun on my stewardess. Let me talk to them. You're through, Colonel. My men will withdraw. That was criminal. Colonel Donner... Yes? - Donner... - Sir? It didn't work. Bring them in. Yes, sir. No tricks this time. Hello, Petrie, this is Sunflower. Sunflower. We're still in business. Mrs Palmer... I have agreed to the demands of the hijackers. You asked me to let those men go... I wouldn't do it. It's not in my nature. Despite what you might think... I've been trying to protect lives, not waste them. I'm a soldier. I can't give in, just because there's a gun to my head. But the gun isn't at your head. The gun is at my husband's head. I never accused you of wasting lives. But you take risks with other people's lives. A commanding officer is not always required to put his own life in the balance. He can be an armchair general. Gerald spent four years fighting a hand-to-hand war in Yugoslavia. He was captured, he was tortured... his heart never recovered from it. He was a soldier. Men like you merely play a game. I failed, General. Is anyone hurt? No, no-one was hurt. No casualties? No, and no shots were fired at all. No... not one. You're a very lucky man. I promise you, Tahlvik, the next one you send will die. Your men with the authorities. But I warn you... they will refuse outright if you cause any loss of life. Is that clear? Scotland Yard's known about someone called Petrie for two years... They know he's involved with Shepherd's group but, like Shepherd, he's never been arrested... Marigold. it's a code-name... Waiting to deliver diplomatic mail to the Queen's Messenger... He's on that plane, sir... Who are “they”? The British. This is Captain Barnes of the British Embassy. You can't win 'em all. No, Frank. You can't win them all. Palmer must be in pretty bad shape by now. D'you think... if I offered to take Palmer's place... they'd agree? I think Shepherd would be very pleased to get you on board. After all, Frank... on your evidence he'll go to prison for the rest of his life. He'll want you on board, if only to throw you off at 30,000 feet. Now, Petrie... he wouldn't kill you. Petrie knows the rules. But I warn you, they will refuse outright if you cause any loss of life. Is that clear? What was that, Frank? A reminder? I don't know what you mean. I mean, it's you - the British - who've been holding my country to ransom... I mean that your man Petrie was ordered by London to hijack that plane... but he mustn't kill anyone; “No-one must be hurt”. It doesn't matter what happens to a hundred helpless passengers in the process. We are negotiating the release of your men with the authorities. But I warn you, they will refuse outright if you cause any loss of life. Is that clear? It's clear to me, but is it clear to Tahlvik? It is clear. Very clear. How long did Petrie work undercover to get close to Shepherd? Two years? Where was their dropping zone? You said you'd discovered where it was. London had no idea where Shepherd was going to bale out... and Petrie could only tell them the code-name... Marigold. Now, that's why you hijacked that plane - just to get Shepherd. I'm Her Britannic Majesty's Messenger. I am carrying diplomatic mail. You, Brigadier, are under arrest. May I remind you I have diplomatic immunity! That privilege ceased the moment you carried one of these aboard a civil aircraft... stuffed with guns. Hello, Tower... request permission to take off. - Tahlvik! - Yes? Colonel, I am prepared to exchange the Ambassador for another hostage. Ok. Who do you want? The British Military Attaché, Captain Barnes. I'll go find him. Good news, Frank. Petrie wants you instead of Palmer. Very well. Sit down! You bloody fool! You did what you were told, obeyed orders... Don't you understand there are orders you must not obey? Mike Tango Oscar. Hello, Tower. Captain Barnes is coming out. Start pressures are okay. Collision light is on. Starting number-two engine. Welcome aboard... Captain Barnes. That's not Barnes! Kill the bastard! Your friend here didn't come to save you, Shepherd. You've been betrayed. Ray Petrie is a policeman. Pig! What's happening? Don't shoot! Careful... that's a detonator. Where is the Ambassador? Ambassador... Sir...?
