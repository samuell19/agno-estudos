Oh, yes, it is. See the pretty grass. Where? Nyuck, nyuck, Nyuck, nyuck. You're next. But I had a bath. When? July 4th, 1910. I was too young to fight about it then.

Gee, kids, we're in luck. That 50,000 bucks is down the hall, just waiting for Mama. Oh, that's swell. Now, see if we've got it right. We pretend we're three rich widows. We meet the goofs, make 'em propose to us and marry 'em. Right, then we get their dough and give 'em the ozone. That's what the hotel manager will give us if we don't get some dough. [SQUEAKING] GIRL: All right, Darwin. Now, you go next door and get lost, and we'll come and find you. Run along. Hey, you better order some more. We only got four left.

Moe, Moe, I got 'em, I got 'em! I'm seeing gorillas. Don't look at me when you say that. CURLY: I got the DT's. I'm seeing gorillas, I tell you. Oh, you're crazy. The joint's haunted. Look, the pants are walking. Maybe it's ants. What's going on around here? His pants are walking and he ain't in 'em. Eh, you guys have been drinking. Pants are walking around. Ow! My pants bit me! We'd better kill 'em. Wait a minute. Are you insane? That's that $5,000 gadget. Here's a board. Gimme that. Why didn't you bring me a softer board?

Have you seen him? Oh, so that's what's running around here. Say, what's that monkey got that I ain't got? MOE: A longer tail. Ya-ee. Oh, I do hope he's not hurt. He's the only ray of sunshine left in the lives of three lonely widows. He's the only happiness we have with all our millions. Did you say millions? Yes, just a few, and we're so, so lonely. Oh, what you girls need is a husband. GIRLS [IN UNISON]: Oh, this is so sudden, darling. [GIGGLING] You mean you'll marry us? With the millions? [IN UNISON]: Yes. It's a deal! We're the monkeys you are looking for. Change those weeds for some glad rags. It won't take a minute. We'll be right back. If you change your mind, we'll sue you for habeas corpus. We're back in the money again. Look at that monkey. He's got the letter. We better get it away from him before those girls find out we're broke. [WINDOW SHUTS] Well, we're rid of him. Hurry up, girls, before those suckers change their minds. [SQUEAKING] Oh, what is it, Darwin? How do you like those chiselers, double-crossing us? Say, will I tell that mug something. We're gonna pay those guys a visit, come on. Open up. They'll never open up, boss. Let's use the fire escape. Right. It's the manager. Let's give him a reception. What I'll do to that guy with the sugar bowl haircut. Ready, give. [SHRIEKING] Oh, why-- Jeez, the girls. Oh, yes, it's us. We're sorry, girls. We didn't know it was you. Oh, that's quite all right.
