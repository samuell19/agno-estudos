What did the lawyer say? He is asking for another thirty thousand. But we have already paid his fees. He said he spent it on our case. I am not sure how true that is. Don't drop your food on the floor. Why don't you come with me? He missed you on my last visit. No. You carry on. Do you have enough money for the bus? Sarsu's husband is going that way; I'll go in his rickshaw. What a mess! Wash your hands properly. And don't roam around in the sun. Come back soon. Don't pick a fight with anyone. Are you even listening to me? Did you hear me? You leaking tank! You pee in your bed every night and hide your dirty pants! Where will you go? Hey, wait for me. I'll deal with you when you're back home, you leaking tank. I'll make you sleep on the roof tonight. Pee all you want up there. Your idea was a total flop. You should have hidden your pants on the roof. She would have never found it there. -Shut up. You sneak rice from home everyday. Should I tell Mummy? Sure, go tell her. Leaking tank. All grown up but you still wet your pants. Shut up and hurry up. Run... run. Two more runs. Hey, 'Crow Eggs'. Come play with us. Caw...caw...caw...caw...caw...caw. Any eggs in there? Yes. How many? Three! Get them all. No. Let's divide them equally. One for you, one for me and one for the crow. Ok. Bhai... I don't think Nana will come now. Let's leave. Are you going on a 'hot date'? No. Then shut up and stay put. Nana is here! Hurry up. Good morning. Hello Nana … How are you? Namaste Nana Hey Pokya, how is it going? Fine Sir. Chillar? Sir these boys are from our neighbourhood. Hello Nana ... They run the cable network. If you want to run an advertisement for your store, just tell them. They will get it done. They are useless Nana. Good for nothing. Keep quiet. - Sir, this hardly looks like ten thousand square feet. Yes it is… you can check the documents sir. Documents can be easily forged. Look at our Vashi plot documents, Sir got it forged. Sorry Sir. Come on kids ... Let's go. Hurry up! Sir, our documents are clear. It's very hard to find such an open, clear plot in Mumbai. You are quite lucky to have found this one. Ask Papa for a mobile. Why should I? Ask him yourself. Why are you telling me to ask him? Don't you want one? Oh yeah! As if you would let me play games on it. Of course I will. Trust me. But you ask Papa for it. You ate a crow's egg, didn't you? No. Wait here. He will come. How are you? Are you taking your medication on time? You don't seem too well yourself. I am fine. How is mother? She is fine. She wanted to come along, but I asked her not to. Are the kids here? Yes, downstairs. They aren't letting the kids in. It's them isn't it? Yes. Hey, Boys! That is Papa's voice. What are you doing there? We are playing with a cat. They are playing... Hey! What do you think you are doing? This is a police station. Sir ... They are my kids. So, What's the big deal? Don't shout out to them from here. Papa, when will you get us a mobile phone? Bloody brats... Bhandare tell them to shut up. Shinde, shut those kids up! Do they go to school? How did your father land up in jail? I don't know. Why do they call you 'tutti frutti'? As a child I used to work at a paan stall. I used to eat all the 'tutti frutti' instead of putting it in the paan. One day the owner thrashed me. Since then everyone calls me 'tutti frutti'. Have you got 'tutti frutti' for lunch too? No, bread and vegetables. Want to eat some? No. Yuck. My name is 'Crow Egg'. Wow! 'Crow Egg'... 'Tutti Frutti'. I'm "Little Crow Egg". He's "Big Crow Egg". Just shut up or else I'll tell mummy. Amazing! What is in it? Coal. What? Train coal... we pick it from the tracks everyday. Oh, coal! But what do you do with it? We sell it. Three rupees a kilo. Sarang! Whom are you talking to? Time up! Let's go! Ok. Bye. Bye. Five kilos. It is right. Here. Go get cake from Aunty. Kesha Darling! ... How are you dude? You buggers. Where did you get this from? None of your business. Just weigh it and give us the money. This will bring the municipality to my door. Kesha don't worry, we'll take care of it. Idiot, will you be here if they come for me? Of course! Tell him. We have a lot of clout with the cops. You know the cops? Yeah. Did they invite him to inaugurate the new lock up? Don't bring such stuff to me anymore. Kesha Darling ... give us the money and just chill. Come in the evening... let's have 'little-little'. Have some cake. Aunty, can I have this watch? Yes, take it. Mummy when will we buy a TV? We'll get one only when you stop peeing in your pants. Why do you keep nagging him about it? He'll stop when he grows up. How much did you get today? Fifteen rupees. Mummy tell Papa to give us a mobile. Once Papa is free, he'll get you one, sweetheart. Ever since your visit to the jail you look quite upset. What is the matter? He has lost so much weight. I am worried. Oh you're worried about him! Shouldn't you be mad at him? He landed himself in jail. What is the point in getting mad? I must get him out of jail. Tell me if you know a way to get him out. Go meet Chamdi. He is Nana's man but what a lech! Nana is a busy man. You think he'll see you just because you are here? Mangya! Is that your brother? Hey! Nana is calling you. Can't you hear him? Yes Ma'am. Wait here, I'll be back. Careful you idiot. I have to manage the entire neighbourhood. All thanks to me, or else they'll bring your shop down in a single night. Give it to him. Keep it inside. Is that all of it? These are four bundles. Mr. Mujumdar, the boys tell me that your shop has many branches across Mumbai? Not just Mumbai, we have branches in Pune, Satara, Navi Mumbai, Thane... I guess you must be making at least twenty million every month! Twenty... huh... It's forty just in Mumbai... and in Thane... This is our man. Get the tea. What are they doing? Cheering. It's coming down. Cheering. Grandma... you know the whole tree fell down! In a minute! Never mind that tree. Remember there is another one near the temple! It is huge. The crow will go to that tree. They chopped that one long ago. They have put up Nana's statue over there. The crow doesn't lay eggs over there..... ... and when the crow lays eggs, you steal them! They eat crow eggs; I can't hear enough of it from Sarsu. The whole neighbourhood talks about it, but these brats are shameless. Let them have it. Can we afford to give them chicken eggs? Let them have it ... It'll help them grow. Doesn't matter if the crow is black... after all it's a bird. It'll give the children strength to fly! Don't defend them. If I ever catch you eating crow eggs again, I am going to thrash both of you. And you ... are you done? No, not yet. I slogged so hard for this deal... but Nana doesn't care. Why does this always happen to you Bhai? Why Bhai why? (Reciting poetry) Bloody poet! Mummy... what is that? You wanted a TV didn't you? TV! Awesome! Mummy, you said you'll get a TV only if he stops peeing in his pants. I got it in a lucky draw. You should've got a mobile instead. During the elections they will distribute mobile phones and sim cards. You'll get one then. Till then watch TV. It's mine, I won't let him. - Shut up. 'Wet-pants'. - Go get the cable guy. Grandma... mummy has brought a TV. Cheering Didn't I tell you about the lucky draw? Sarsu got a mixer. Pull! Let it loose. Mummy do you know why everyone has a belly button? Why? The baby comes out of the belly button. Who tells you all this? Tutti frutti! Tutti frutti? He is my friend. He is tutti frutti and I am Crow Egg. Crow Egg? Yes. My name is Crow Egg. He is Big Crow Egg and I'm Little Crow Egg. Useless... don't run away. Look. I have a watch. Just like yours. This is a toy watch. Look this one is an original. You think wearing a watch will make you a big shot! Yes it will. Wait and watch. Mummy... There he goes again. Tell me ... What is your name? Crow Egg. Dad bought him. For how much? Twenty five thousand! Mummy you know our friend Sarang? He bought a dog for twenty five thousand! Its face is like this... Shall we buy one? Hey Crow Eggs! Mummy... How did Papa land up in jail? Sir, these film actors never show up on time. I have heard that this particular actor always arrives late to the shooting as well. Shilwant, will you shut up? Sir! I have just spoken to Nikhil. The car will be here in 5 minutes. But Sir, the auspicious time will be gone in 5 minutes. It is a bad omen. Sorry sir. Where did you find this one? He is from my wife's town. Cheering. Cheering. Cheering. Cheering. Cheering. Grandma. Hmm... The pizza comes in a parcel by plane everyday! From abroad! What is it called? Pizza! Pizza! Look pizza! It looks so tasty! Must be sweet. Mummy I want the pizza. You keep asking for stuff. Every new thing that you see. Do you think money grows on trees? Don't scold them. They are just kids. Please stay out of this. They have turned into spoilt brats. Their mother tries to save every penny... ...knocks on every door to get their father out of jail ... ... but do they care? I want pizza... not Papa. Did you hear that? If you say that again... I'll burn your tongue, mind you! What is your name? 'Little Crow Egg' My name is 'Big Crow Egg'. Hey! Come here. Isn't there a shorter route here to get to the main road? Is that a pizza? Yes. Is there a way to get to the main road? Go straight, then turn left, then right, you'll come to a signal... Turn left at the signal. Ok. Not left... turn right at the signal. Turn left. Your hand is signaling a right turn. But there used to be a shorter route right here. Show us the pizza and we'll show you the shorter route. Just once ... please. Please. Pizza! Now show me the shorter route. Is that a pizza? This is what Ankush Chaudhari eats? His wife doesn't cook for him? Have you ever had pizza? No. 299! ... 300 rupees! For such a small pizza? Yes, but we are still going to eat this pizza. Mr. Little Crow Egg... to buy this pizza... See that wagon ... you will have to collect a wagon full of coal. We will do it! Bye! This is from the new shop. You must have had pizza. Yes. Several times. Look at this... If you call this number, the pizza gets delivered directly to your house. At home? Yes. Home delivery. Even in our neighbourhood? Yes why not? But you have to pay for it. Once the pizza is delivered. You have money don't you? We are going to collect a wagon full of coal for the pizza. A full wagon? How much do you make in a day? 10 rupees. 10 rupees... So for 300 rupees ... 30 days! That is only one month! Whom are you calling? The Pizza Shop. Pizza shop! How will you pay him? Remember the pizza guy who came here? We'll ask him to deliver the pizza to our house. Once he does, we'll ask him to note it down; we'll pay him in a month. Hello, good afternoon. Pizza Café. We want to have a pizza. Yes Sir. Please tell me your address. Hello are you on the line sir? Near the Kartik temple. "Ok ... Go on." Your building name sir? Your flat number sir? Any landmark sir? Yeah! You can ask anyone, "Which one is Little Crow Egg's house?" They'll tell you. Are you crazy? Grandma... What is our address? Lane next to Kartik temple, Bhimnagar. Yes that is what we told him. But he wanted to know more. Who? The pizza fellow. How much is it for? 300 rupees! Huh! 300 rupees! So expensive! We are still going to have it. Yeah. And you can have some of your mother's thrashing as well. If we save money for a month, we shall have 300 rupees. Why do you want to give them the money? Give it to me. Take this and get the things that I tell you. Onions, tomatoes, chillies. Uncle... Onions, tomatoes and chillies please. And some bell peppers too. Bell peppers! Hurry up please! Grandma... is it done? Not yet. Your pizza is ready! But this doesn't smell like pizza. Don't smell your food. Dogs smell their food not men. There are no strings in it. Strings! Rotten food has strings in it. You said it would be sweet! Bread isn't sweet. Bread! ... yuck. Do you think we are fools? We don't want your pizza. We'll buy our own pizza. The ‘real' pizza. Are you sure about this? Homemade pizza won't do? This is what you want? Come, I'll take you to a treasure. But you can't tell anyone. Sure? Promise me. Promise! Promise! Why didn't you bring us here before? You didn't tell me before. Did you find a treasure chest of coal? Hey Eggs! See you tomorrow ... we're busy today. Come on ... hurry up! Shh. Not so loud. Are we stealing this coal? We are just taking our share. Bonnie and Clyde! What is with all this coal? They are making money... why are you so jealous? All you do is drink all day. Tonya. Here come the Crow Eggs. Hey Crow Eggs! Look at my mobile! You can click photos and shoot videos! You said your father is going to give you a mobile. Where is your mobile? We don't want a mobile. We are going to have pizza. Liar! You think you're some kind of a big shot? Come on. They are going to have pizza! 140 ... 150 ... 225 ... 230 ... 240 ... 300 ... 310. How much? 310! What will you do with all that money? We're going to eat pizza. Pizza? Does your mother know? Yes she knows. Come on. Hey! Where are you going? To eat pizza. Pizza? There is no pizza here. Get lost. Yes there is. We saw Ankush Chaudhari eating pizza here. Hey... 'Ankush Chaudhari!' Go home. Security! What is going on? Nothing Sir. These kids are from the slums. They were barging in. Don't worry. I'll handle this. Go back. Go home. He called us 'beggars'. How did he know we are from the slums? Your clothes. Clothes? Oh yes. Your clothes give away that you live in the slum. How do you know everything? Once I gate crashed a wedding. I thought no one would notice me in the crowd. But one look at my clothes and they knew. I was kicked out. That is when I realized. A man is known by the clothes he wears. I ignore the children's needs to give all the money to the lawyer. Now he says it's not enough. Bloody ******** They are nothing but scavengers. Never mind. Why don't you go to another lawyer? If we do that then this lawyer's fees are wasted. The new lawyer will ask for more money. When I go visit their father, his eyes constantly question me. "When will I be free?" And this rascal of a lawyer can't even get him out on bail. You are doing this all by yourself. I am sorry that I cannot help you in your hardship. I am of no use to anyone anymore. Mother, that is not true. I am able to do everything only because I know you'll take care of the children. What would happen to our home if not for you? Grandma, we had been to the pizza shop today. But they didn't let us in. Tutti frutti said it's because of our clothes... Is it true? Yes my dear. It is true. Those who wear dazzling clothes are rich... And the ones in dirty clothes are paupers. But we had money for the pizza. What? He won't come today. Let's go. Hey Eggs! Wait up! Sorry I am late. But look what I have got for you! Abracadabra! Pizza! Have it. Didn't you want to have pizza? I have brought this specially for you. No thanks. We'll buy our own pizza. But... have it! I have got it for you. Where did you get these clothes from? From the mall. Which mall? City Centre Mall. M.G. Road. City Centre Mall. M.G. Road. Come on. City Centre, M.G. Road… City Centre, M.G. Road. Why didn't you let me eat the pizza? We'll buy it with our own money. Where is Tutti frutti? Who? The fat guy who used to work here. He used to steal coal. He is fired. I don't know where he is now. What is his name? Tutti frutti What a weird name! Poor Tutti frutti, I wonder where he is. He was fired thanks to us. Now we can't get any coal here. Now we can't even buy the pizza. Don't you want to have the pizza like Ankush Chaudhari? Let's go. Have you seen my husband anywhere? No. For the past whole week you haven't been bringing home any money. Don't you pick the coal anymore? No. We play all day. We are going to see your father in a couple of days. I'll tell him what you are up to. We don't want to visit Papa. Why do you say that? She works so hard. You must try to help her. You shut up. All you do is sit at home and eat. Mind your tongue or you'll get it from me. You should have taken Sarang's pizza. He had already eaten half of it. You want his leftover pizza? Singing to himself. Aunty! What is it? He is drunk. Let's go. Wait. He is going to die drinking. Here. Both of you have some cake. Is that how you talk to a customer? What about 'customer care'? Get lost you drunk. Uncle, where is your home? Why? Give us 10 rupees we'll take you home. How many rounds was it? 5. Don't touch the car. Done! Two days makes it 20 rupees. 410. Another 100 and we shall buy us some new clothes. Ok? Ok ok. Let's sell Tommy! Dog for sale! Sir, would you like to buy a puppy? You guys have begun selling dogs at signals now! How much? 25 thousand. How much? 25 thousand. What a scam... get lost! Brother, this one won't work. Why not? It is torn. Never mind, it's fine. Hey fatty... hurry up. Shut up skinny freak. Tonya look at them. Hey Crow Eggs! Did you have the pizza? 430 … 440 … 450 … 460 … 470 … 480... 490 … 500 … 510. How much is it? 520. We have enough money now! Ticket! Where are you going? To shop for new clothes! Sir of course you are! But where exactly are you going? City Centre... M.G. Road. 2 'half tickets'. City Centre! Sir, City Centre Mall? Here it is. Whoa! They are never going to let us in there. Do you like your new clothes? Yes.. Dad… panipuri! Dad... panipuri! No my dear. It's not hygienic. It'll make you sick. You never give us what we really want. Don't say that. Look we bought such lovely clothes for you. We have spent 4 thousand rupees on them. But we never asked for new clothes. Let's go home. I'll ask mummy to make some instant noodles for you. No. I want to have paanipuri. No you won't get it. Let me call your mother, we are leaving immediately... My mobile! Stay here. I'll be right back. Do you want to have paanipuri? Do you like them? They are awesome! Did you just throw them out? Yes! "I'll have a word with him... yes" Didn't I tell you not to have this paanipuri! Where are your bags? We sold them. Sold them? Cheering. Hey! Where do you think you're going? Didn't I tell you not to come here? Get lost! But look ... We have new clothes. So you think new clothes will let you in? Don't get ahead of yourselves. Security! What is the matter? What do they want? Sir these kids are from the slum ... they keep coming back. What is your problem? We haven't done anything. So? We are here to have pizza. But this bugger ... he is abusing us. How dare you abuse? Next time I see you here I'll break your bones. Bloody beggars. Go beg on the streets. I better not see you here again. Get lost. Beggars. You dare not come back. Pizza is not for you. Get lost. Brother, let's leave. She is no more! This won't even buy the wood. This is all I have. You don't even have enough money for the funeral? Ok. This will do. Come on. Tell me the truth. Where did you get so much money? We were'nt playing all these days. We were selling coal. We found a whole lot of coal. We sold it and bought these clothes. Chanting Hey Crow Eggs! Want some more pizza? What was that about? Both of them went to have pizza yesterday. They got beaten up instead. Where? At the new pizza shop. They were beaten? Yeah! It was so funny! Who beat them? The pizza guy. Why? Of course they'll get thrashed if they ask for free pizza. No. They had money. They even wore new clothes. But still that guy hit them. Here. What is it? Just take a look at this. Fine. Go home. Come back tomorrow for your mobile. It's my father's mobile. He'll yell at me. Oh Daddy's darling. Get lost. Let's go fatty. Chillar ... This mobile... it's going to make us rich ... very rich. Bhai it's an outdated model. You won't get anything for this. Forget about the model ... watch this. What? This. How will that make us rich? Idiot ... But... Bhai... Fool. I'll finish this. What is this? The kids are from our slum. If this is exposed ... if the media gets hold of this clip... We have already discussed this over the phone. What do you want? Well ... I'll take what you can offer. I'll let you know. Ok. Bye. Ok sir. Here. Once you decide, just give me a call. Keep it. Ok sir. Bye. Bhai he has such a hawk like nose. Don't worry, this hawk is going to sing like a canary. Instead of getting involved in it why don't we just sell the video to Ashok? To Ashok? Yeah, we can easily make money out of it. If we sell it to him, he'll sell it to the media. We won't get much out of it. Instead if we cut a deal with the owner, he'll give us five thousand. Five thousand! We'll get 2500 each! Five thousand is too much, let's ask for two thousand. Just two thousand? You fool! That is way too less. Just two thousand? Think big ... don't get stuck in trivial deals. Sir don't waste any time. Call him. Call them! I am not calling those fools. Sir they are no fools. In fact they are quite smart. They have only given us a copy of that video. If the media gets hold of this clip... ... the human rights activists will cry ill treatment of slum children.. ..atrocity even child abuse... ... and force us to shut shop. In my opinion we should call Nana Jagdale. He is their leader. Nana Jagdale! He is a con man. He'll take our money and still have the people in the slum at our throats. Hello who is this? Shilwant here. Who? Shilwant. Yeah. Who is it? Yes sir. This is a small matter. Let us not blow it out of proportion. Name your price. Sure, I have already said I'll take what you offer. In that case we'll give you fifty thousand rupees at the most. Bhai don't ask for 3 thousand. Just settle for 2. Ok. It's not much but I'll accept it. Ok. Bring the original clip and take your money. Ok sir. Sir you are a very lucky man! What did he say? Idiot. You wanted to ask for just 2 thousand. 3 would be too much huh? Do you know what I have settled for? How much? 4 thousand! 4 thousand! You are the best! These kids are our lottery ticket! Mummy! No wet pants today! Little Crow Egg is all grown up! Sorry sir I am late. Original video? Sir give me the money and take your video. You may be smart enough to make money... but to spend it you need to stay alive. I better not see you here again. Of course sir. This matter is over forever. Ok sir. Just a minute. Are you sure there is no other copy of this video? No sir. I swear. This is all I had. Well known pizza chain - Pizza Café have recently inaugurated a new branch. A manager from this pizza shop has been caught on video brutally assaulting two young children. The reason behind it being they wanted to have pizza. In fact the children had enough money to buy their own pizza. The children are from the neighbourhood slum. This incident has once again brought to the fore the rift in society. Our news correspondent has captured this incident on his camera. Let us take a look at it. Hello. Bhai you have no idea what I have done! Forget the pizza shop owner. How much was he offerring us? 4 thousand? You want to know how much Ashok gave me for that video? 5 thousand! I am sure it is already on TV. I got us a much better deal! Bhai drinks on me tonight! I am waiting. Why is he late? Bloody fool! What is it? Why are you beating me? You think you are a smart ass? You can have your 50% Shove those 50% .... Do you have any idea how much they were offering? How much? How much? He was ready to shell out 50 thousand. 50 thousand! What a waste ... they beat me up instead. Bhai you were going to double cross me? Does it hurt? Yeah. They really went for it. But wait and watch ... I'll make them pay for it. Yes of course. Call for it. One soft drink for my friend here! Soft drink? Well, get a beer. Two young children living in a slum. They were barred from entering Pizza Café in spite of having enough money. In fact the boys were even brutally thrashed by a Pizza Café manager. Our correspondent tried to speak to the owner of the pizza café ... ...but he seemed reluctant to comment on this issue. The identity of both the kids still remains unknown. What do you think? Will such kinds of incidents keep happening in our society? I condemn this government. We need to look at this incident with a specific political point of view. Just a minute Ma'am. I must interrupt you. We are taking a break here. But don't go anywhere and keep watching News 21. Our topic of discussion is Pizza vs. Bhakri. Send in your views at #pizzavsbhakri Brother, let us earn a lot of money. We'll give it all to mummy. It'll help Papa come out of jail. Thousands of families live in these slums that are completely ignored by our society. Hundreds of children from these families work on daily wages to help run their houses. The two innocent children are from one such family. Their only crime is their desire to eat a pizza which is a symbol of a lavish lifestyle. The dreams of many such children are crushed before they blossom. When will this end? With Cameraman Rakesh, I am Gayatri Bapat for ABP Majha. We must do something. They have attacked these children from our community. I raised my voice to get justice. But they beat me up. You went asking for justice? Yes he went by himself. But look what they did to him. Do as I say. Gather all the women from the neighbourhood. Right now. We'll march to their doors. You are right Nana. We'll do as you say. I'll call the news channels. Let's make it huge! Ok Nana. We need your support. Nana. Never mind. What have you done? Pokya has been looking for you. Why? It seems the pizza shop owner beat you up? They said they are showing it on TV. Don't scare the kids. These tiny little rug rats... but they are so brave! Bravo! How did we turn up on TV? I don't know. Hand me my mobile. I'll tell Pokya the kids are here. They are leaving! Hey, take your money. Sarsu, are you coming to the protest march tomorrow? They are giving us one meal and 100 rupees. What is this march for? Apparently some one thrashed some kids from the slum. Our slum? I am sure they must have done something. Will you be there? No. Yes Mr. Mujumdar. I am sure you have heard about the whole incident. Yes I saw it on TV. But sir, you should have called me before this whole episode blew up. The kids are from my slum, from my community. What if you get charged under ‘atrocity'? I want to put an end to this immediately. Please help me. What? Please help me. Help? Of course I'll help you. In a country where the poor struggle to have two square meals a day... ... two poor children dreamt of having a pizza. But they had to pay a heavy price for their dream. Let us take a look at what the people have to say about it. Who shot our video? Have they turned on the water? I'll be right there. Why are you staring at a blank screen? Mummy! Huh? No... nothing. I know you are up to something. Amma hurry up or you won't get any water. The pizza shop owner has it coming. He has no clue what is going to happen. He'll see what I am all about! There she is! I have been looking for you all over. I even went to your factory. Me? Yes you! Never mind. I want you right at the front of the march. Me? - Yeah. Why? Why? We are doing this for your children and you want to just sit at home? Don't you watch TV? Your children are all over on TV. The pizza guy beat them and the matter has heated up. Hit them? They hit my children? Where are the kids? There were right here. Here? Where are they now? Oh my god. Kidnapped. They have kidnapped the kids. Kidnapped? - Yes. They kidnapped my children? Who are they? Don't worry. The news channels are supporting us. Nana is standing by us. You don't worry. We'll find the children. Chillar... Let's go look for them. Have you seen my children? They just went this way. Have you seen my boys? They must have gone to have pizza. Boys! Little Crow Egg! I know everything... about your boys, your husband. It'll be alright. Don't you worry. I have spoken to a lawyer. Nana is standing by you. They are just children. How far could they go? They'll be somewhere around here. Will you have something to drink? I have looked everywhere for the children. Everyone has a different story. Your children are like my children. Rest assured... Nana will make sure that the men who are behind this will pay for it. They cannot get away with treating our children like this. You go home. When the children come home, bring them here to me. This incident took place outside a branch of the famous pizza chain - Pizza Café. This video has gone viral across social media. When will such brutality come to an end? We are getting reactions to this incident from far and wide. This incident of brutality against children has enraged the people from all over. It has created a stir even in the government. Let us take another look at this video. Don't worry sir. Give me some time. I'll bring the children to you. Sister, this is for you and the rest of the ladies. Create such a ruckus that the pizza shop falls apart. Don't you worry. The cops are already here? Shut up. Hello Sir. Are you the mother of those children? Yes sir. You are right on time. She is the mother and this is ‘the Eggs' nest.' Where are your children? I don't know sir. They have been missing since yesterday. Do you know where the frogs hide after the rains? Where? In the clouds. When the sun is out they evaporate. When it rains they come down again. No way! Liar. I'm not lying. I swear. Hey. Have you seen the kids from the pizza shop? The kids from the TV news. They are right here. Sir. They are getting away. Don't run away! Boys! Mummy! Where were you the whole night? They showed our clip on TV. Everyone was looking for us. We got scared. Come with me. Pokya... when is your march? Bhai! You're a fool. Good morning sir. We have found the children. Sir. I am bringing them to you right now. Yes sir. Thank you sir. Look! I guess Ankush Chaudhari is back. Cheering. It is cold in here. Do you like our shop? Get the pizza. But we don't have any money. Doesn't matter my dear. It is free for you today. Sir why don't you feed them yourself? I apologize to everyone for the unfortunate incident. Are you sure this wasn't just another marketing ploy to promote your business? No, not at all. What happened is indeed very sad. I do not discriminate between rich and poor. Sir, tell them about the 49 rupees' pizza. Soon we are going to introduce a pizza for just rupees 49 at this branch. Do you like the pizza? Not at all. You? No. It's disgusting. So dry and flaky. And sticky too. The pizza that grandma made was so much better than this one. How do we finish the rest of this pizza?
