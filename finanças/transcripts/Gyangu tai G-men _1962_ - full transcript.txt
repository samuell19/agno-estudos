Chief! What was the meeting about? - What are you investigating? - Is Tatsumura involved? There are rumors that Sanritsu Industries is behind all this. Isn't its president Tatsumura the mastermind behind this incident? Aren't you flooded with complaints about police ineffectiveness in the case? They say the authorities are too cautious, or worse, weak-kneed. I'll ask you the same question: What do you guys think? It's easy to criticize others. But are you trying to bring back the old, heavy-handed police power? It's not as if cautious investigation is bad. And that's part of the difficulty of this job. It's not you who's been getting your men killed at every turn, it's me. Oh, hi. The press? Yeah. I got a little excited. I went to the farewell ceremony for Detective Sugiyama. I see. Well. That's three in a row. - What a shame. - Yeah. And...the meeting? It's like we've hit a dead end. We don't have a concrete plan. All the violent incidents in this neighborhood are connected to Sanritsu Industries. I'm sure I'm on the right track, but I don't know where to start to catch them by the tail… We don't have a single clue. We're helpless. It's our own fault that the city is calling us weak-kneed. The three men who died would turn in their graves. SANRITSU INDUSTRIES BUSINESS INFORMATION CHAIRMAN SAICHI SAKURA PRESIDENT JŪGO TATSUMURA I just had an idea. I heard a rumor on the street. Tatsumura has recently taken complete control of the organization. They say things are getting awkward with his uncle, Sakura. Mmm-hmm... So? If we can crack the organization by successfully exploiting this opportunity, we might be able to get some clues for the investigation. I see. But that would require-- Of course. We can't do it alone. We really need the help of a man knowledgeable about the organization. Mmm-hmm. A kind of guerrilla operation. Interesting idea, but I don't know if there's anybody who could be that useful. I actually have a little bit of an idea about that. Oh? Who is it? TOJIMA BROTHERS Hello! Hello! Coming! Oh! Old man! Hi. Hi. Welcome. - Are you two working together? - No. She wouldn't stop asking me to show her how to fix it. Boy, you look terrible! Oh! Did you have the ceremony yet? No, not yet. It seems rather silly to call it a wedding now, but… - We'll invite you when we do, Mr. Ogata. - Sure. - Please come in. - Okay. It looks like two more cars have been added after not coming here for a while. But the two drivers are unavailable, so they're just like decorations now. - Please have a seat. - Okay. Hard-working, kind-hearted… She'll make a good wife. Yeah... I suppose so. So, what brought you here today? Well… It's kind of hard to say what I'm asking you to do. Actually, I just wanted to ask you to go back to the old you. - The old me? - Yes. A yakuza. Old man, don't joke around with me. I wouldn't joke about asking you to do this. Please... I really need your help! What's the story? You want me to be a G-man. You're no stranger to Tatsumura. I would like to ask you to do this. And let me assure you, this isn't about saving the face of the police or anything. We have to crush that germ-like organization as soon as possible. Old man, if you want to talk about that, please take it up with someone else. I'm asking because I know I can count on you. It's not a job that just anybody can do. Don't give me too much credit. I'm not that respectable. But-- First of all, I don't want to do anything that'll open old wounds. Okay. Maybe I shouldn't have asked you to do it. Why don't you get out of this business? I'd be happy to help you find a job. It would be my pleasure. But I'm a man with no education at all living only for this job since I was a simple police officer. The grime sticks and doesn't seem to come off. I might have to die to get it clean. I'm sorry I can't help you. It's okay. I'll definitely attend your wedding. Yeah. Bye. Oh? Is Mr. Ogata going home already? - Yes. - Oh. What was that about? It has nothing to do with us. Yes, this is Tojima Transport Co. Huh? What's up? It's the usual… - Hello. - How's it going? Are you ready to accept our protection? I refuse. I don't want to be under your care. Think carefully about it. Without a driver there wouldn't be any business, you know. What? What did he say this time? Don't worry about it. Huh? The car's back. Oof! Brother! - Osamu! - Osamu! What's wrong? He said he got jumped by thugs. - Thugs? - Yeah. - Let's go inside to treat the wound. - Yes. So when did you get out? Today. I was on my way here. I was surprised to see that the truck was marked "Tojima Transport"! Boss, I'm quitting. No matter how many lives I have, it won't be enough. What are you saying? The two guys taking a break must have gone through the same thing I did. You can't tell us to fight the yakuza. Let's do it, bro! I can help you! To be honest, I'm disappointed that you quit the business. Osamu... What have you learned from four years in juvie? I'm not going to fight. I'm going now because they're probably waiting for me. You're free to quit. You can take your salary up to today. Bro! Bro! I'm disappointed in you, bro. Where's the brother that I used to know? I'm sure he wouldn't just sit back and let this happen to him! Idiot! Damn it! You're not my brother! Osamu! Don't talk to your brother like that. - Take care of yourself. - Thank you. But, you know, don't you think it's frustrating? When you're provoked like that-- It's frustrating, but we'll be out of business if we take on every fight. We're not selling fights. But you were the boss's daughter. You should understand how I feel. I've forgotten, you know, the old days. Both your brother and I. Suit yourself. No wonder my brother became a coward. His wife's too beautiful and too decent. Sassy little thing, aren't you? You should look before you say something weird. TOJIMA BROTHERS You see? This business belongs to you and your brother. Damn it. My brother, he… Your brother was really looking forward to you getting out. You have to understand. We're half-brothers. We're not meant to be like other brothers in the world. What are you talking about? I'll throw you a welcome home party tonight. What's your favorite thing? What do you want to eat? Osamu? Osamu! Where are you going? Who was it? Who was it? Who did this? - Mr. Jo. - Boss! - This is my car. - What? I parked it on the corner over there, and it's… That's right. Why is this happening again? Shall I take care of this? Mind your own business. Leave me alone. Don't say that. You need our protection in case things like this happen. Right? - That means you guys are-- - Boss! Anyway, let's go in. I see…They've even come to your business for protection money? If they know the old you, they wouldn't be able to do something stupid like that. Well, go ahead. Sorry. Because of my mess, even your store is-- No, actually, my business is being blackmailed, too. You too, Jo? Yeah. In the beginning they called me to invite me. When I refused, the thugs came. I told 'em to look people in the eye when talking and threw 'em out. And here we are today. You didn't report it to the police, did you? Yeah, I thought about that. But if the cops are there all day long, no customers will come. They predicted that much, all right. Do you know which group the thugs belonged to? They belong to the Takeda family down the street. I think Sanritsu Industries is the mastermind behind the protection racket. I heard that the Takeda family's boss became a shareholder of Sanritsu Industries the other day. I think that's fishy. I didn't know that. A champion, huh? Well, I'm past my prime if I'm remembering the old days. Welcome back! Oh... - What happened to your car? - Uh… What happened to the drivers? Well… Did they all quit? Yes. But that's okay. Hire someone new again. Maybe I should learn to drive. What about tomorrow's work? I turned it down earlier. I'm sure it's not a good time. Come on! Tonight is Osamu's welcome home party. It's going to be at my apartment. - Osamu? - What's wrong? I showed those guys from the Takeda family how strong I got in juvie. Idiot! What would you do if something happened to you? Worry more about yourself than you do about me! - Osamu, what happened? - Ouch! Captain Fujikawa was happy that you agreed. We'll help as much as we can. But this work is informal. Yes. So it's strange when I'm the one asking you to do this, but - you take good care of yourself and-- - Old man. You needn't worry about that. I'm willing to do it even if no one asks me to do it. Well, I feel better now that you put it that way. And what about your subordinates? I want to work in my own way, so I'm going to get five or six guys who are used to fighting. What I'd really like from you is a car that starts fast. I've already got it for you. I've got a good driver too. - Come with me now. - Okay. Why did we stop here? Well, wait and see. He'll appear any moment. Huh? Matsushima! Hey, you're caught red-handed. I haven't done it yet. You should be glad you haven't. If you had, you'd be back eating stinky food in jail. Sorry. I'll tell you what, instead, I'm going to have a little chat with you. Please, no more lectures-- That's not what I meant. - I want to show you something. - Huh? Whoa! This engine-- It's like a sports car! What do you think? Would you like to drive it? Oh? You don't mind? - I'll leave it with you. - Yeah! Oh, it's a police motorcycle. - Should we make a run for it? - Idiot! You should stop for the poor guy. Are you sure? Do you know how fast you were going just now? Thank you for your work, but there's a reason for that. Are you on a case? Yes, well, something like that. Sorry about that. Thank you for your work. This is great! Shall we try a little more? I've had enough of this. I'll turn it down this time. I'll introduce you to a guy you might like. Go! You damned fool! What the hell are you doing? Fuck you, motherfucker! Come here! Get the fuck off me! You son of a bitch! You ruined a girl's life! Get the fuck off me! Get off of me! - What's going on? - Oh... He tricked a runaway girl and sold her. Oh. Well, that's the guy. He's so hot-blooded that he sometimes forgets his duties. But he's a great shot. I'll introduce you. - Excuse me. - Oh! What are you doing? - I see, he's fast-- - Drop the gun! Oh, excuse me. Mr. Ogata asked me to test your skills. Sorry, sorry. This man is right. Never trust a person who has a gun. By the time you get mad at their trick, it's too late. Okay. Old man, you should explain. - I have some other ideas. - Okay. Ron. There you go. Ron. - Here, reach! - Ron! Little three dragons. Half flash. You bastard! You son of a bitch! Bro! I don't know what all this is about, but give him a break. I'm telling you-- Let's go. Come on. Man! Thanks for saving me. I guess it's different when you're a pro. Don't you have any shame, cheating a bunch of thugs? Well, it's like they say, "Poverty dulls the spirit." What's up? I need to borrow your help. It's work, isn't it? Is it a safe or is it a-- Neither. Anyway, come to my house tonight. If you want the manager, he ain't here! The owner changed today. Go there to collect the debt! Looks like things are pretty rough for you. Boss. You've come at a good time. I'm not sure I'd enjoy a farewell party by myself. What farewell party? They're all gone. How did that happen? Well... A series of disturbances the other night, you know, bartenders running away, waitresses being taken… Even the debt was taken over by Sanritsu Industries. The former champion is no longer in shape! I'll give them all to that bastard Tatsumura! I'll explain later, but I want you to come to my place tonight. Hey, sis! My brother's back! Honey, those people have come to pick up the truck. Did you really sell it? Yeah, we've already made the deal. Please take it! Hey, why are you doing this? What are we going to do now? I'm sorry to break it to you, but I've decided to go back to my old life. What? You'll have to live in the apartment for a while. That's the brother I know! Sorry, but there's a world of men that women don't understand. Right, bro? You go live with her. And get a job. That's stupid! Please, please don't do it. Did you forget what happened four years ago? Didn't you almost die trying to crawl out of the muck? Don't get desperate just because things aren't working here. We can go somewhere where there are no yakuza. Please, please don't do it. I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind. This time I'm going to do it my way. That's right! That's right, brother! But you can't do it alone, bro. Hey, please, let me do it. I'll bring my friends if you want. Idiot! I said no, you can't do it. Pack your bags with her. I've now given you the gist of it. I'd really like some help from you all. I just want to assure you that we're subcontracting for the police. It's low-pay despite the risk. I'd like to know if you're still willing to take it on. Please don't hesitate to tell me. When you say subcontracting for the police, how will you start? First I'll pretend to make a comeback to the yakuza. Then I'll infiltrate their organization under the guise of a turf war. That would mean we're the Tojima family. Gentlemen, this is the perfect role for you. If you look in the mirror I think you'll see what I mean. I don't want to flatter you, but I'd hardly call you all good citizens. But it takes a hell of a lot of guts and horsepower to hit them. You're all perfect team members in that regard. Hey, bro, even though it's police work, we're putting our lives on the line. There will be a little reward, won't there? I can't guarantee that. I'm sure you'll manage it just fine. But don't forget there's a policeman next to you. So let's hear your answer. Can you guys give me a hand? Let's show them what we can do! I'll get Tatsumura back for his protection racket. How about you, Matsushima? Well, I'm being asked to take care of the car. I don't see anyone else qualified. Goro? I'll do my best to save the extra money. Mr. policeman? It's my duty so I'll do whatever-- You scared me! - Osamu! - Brother... Don't treat me like a stranger! Everyone, I'm his brother, Osamu Kaji. We're actually half-siblings. How many times have I told you? I'm not gonna make you one of us. Again with that. I wish you'd trust me. But a goofball like you would be the first to get hit. I can't take care of a guy like that. Well, then, brother. You mean you can't-- You'd be slowing me down. Give it up. Fine, then! I'll do my own thing! Osamu... Osamu! He's just like you the way he won't back out of something once he's said it. He's a real pain in the ass. So everything is okay then, right? Okay, now let's get to work. First you'll go out and spread word that I'm making a comeback. TOJIMA BROTHERS ♪ That man… ♪ By pistol. ♪ That man… ♪ By tommy gun. ♪ That man… ♪ By dynamite. ♪ Everybody, everybody disappears in a puff of smoke ♪ With water. ♪ When the blood left on the bed dries up ♪ There, I hear it. ♪ That rhythm ♪ ♪ Sing it! ♪ ♪ Dance all you want! ♪ ♪ Jam session on an enchanting night ♪ ♪ I'm drunk and I'm all alone ♪ May I sit here? If you don't mind me sitting with you. Would you like to buy me a drink? In return, you tell me whose territory this is. You sure aren't tight-lipped, are you? I'll have what he's having. I hear a retired yakuza named Tojima is making a comeback. Well. I'm sure there will be an uproar now. I don't think Tatsumura will allow it. But Tojima and Tatsumura must have been like brothers. People only think that's true. They don't get along with each other very well. I'm telling you this for your own good. If you want to make a living as a yakuza, it's smarter to join Tatsumura. Thanks for the advice. If you want, I can ask the higher-ups for you. Did Tatsumura ask you to scout for the yakuza? Huh? You'll have to ask Tatsumura if you can hire a guy named Tojima. Then you're… Next time you see me, call me Tojima. RECREATION CENTER CONSTRUCTION Who are you? You almost got yourself killed. Do you know what's going on here? I do, but thanks anyway. Don't get me wrong. I'm here to kill you. Don't move! Do you recognize this face? Five years ago… Five years ago? In a turf war on the beach, you shot a guy named Kuroki. Then you're Kuroki's-- I'm his younger brother. Now that you remember, I'm going to kill you. Wait! That wasn't supposed to be a fatal injury. No respectable doctor would've treated that wound. It's no wonder it was fatal. I made a vow then. I swore I'd kill you if I ever saw you! Are you hurt? You think you saved me? That doesn't make up for my brother! Wait a minute! I get how you feel, but I've got a job I've got to do. I won't let you stop me. - Boss, are you hurt? - I'm fine. The advertisement worked 100%. I've already got a lot of sponsors. That's the guy. Him? A debt is a debt. I'll wait until your job is done. In exchange, I'm not leaving your side for a while. I won't let you die until it's by my hand. So you're a bodyguard. Well, okay. He's an old friend of mine. Try to get along. Starting tomorrow we're going to be busy. SANRITSU INDUSTRIES Boss, Tojima is here. What do you want to do? I thought they'd be here by now. Hey. To what do we owe this surprise? It's been a while. How's your shipping company doing? I heard you were happy together with the previous boss's daughter. I don't think I can make a living as an honest man. I'm going back to the old Tojima. I see. That's why you came all the way out here to say hello. Shimadzu. Let's celebrate Tojima's comeback. Book a welcome home party-- You already threw me a welcome home party. A fancy one with lead bullets. I know it was supposed to be a fireworks show, but it was very much your style. Tojima.... You've become nastier living as an honest man. I'm not as bad as you. You took over this building in less than four years? I was hoping you'd tell me how to make money. That's the kind of advice one can only get from a professional. I wish you'd stop with the innuendos. Sanritsu Industries is a legitimate company. And we pay our taxes. If you want, you can go ask the tax office. But I hear there's a lot of money to be made without the tax office knowing. What do you mean? For example... protection rackets. That sort of work fits these guys. Don't move! What's this? A raccoon dog's tail? I'm the one who built all this. I have some allies, but also many enemies. You can never be too careful. Everyone, leave us. I think it's time to cut to the chase. I'm being extorted, it seems. No, I just need a little help. It's a lot of work to make up for four years of absence. I'd like to borrow your territory for a while, for old time's sake. Sorry, I don't have anything like that right now. I have enough to eat running a theater and a recreation center. Oh yeah? That's a relief. Then I'll make my own territory without reservation. That's all well and good, but be careful. They say once a boxer retires, he never makes a comeback again. Jinxes can be broken someday, you know. Well, look forward to it. I see. Tojima has shown up so now Tatsumura has more things to worry about. That's why he tried to get rid of him last night. That was a screw-up, out of character for Tatsumura. I'm getting lucky. It's good to live a long time. You've pit the two against each other for your own advantage? I'm the one who originally created Sanritsu Industries, after all. I didn't want to keep it in Tatsumura's care forever. So... Shall we propose the election of a new president at the next general meeting? No, I think we'll wait and see what Tojima does. - Chairman! - Hmm? Mr. Tojima has come to say hello to you. Good thing he came now. Have him come over here. Mr. Chairman, it's been a while. Yeah, a while. I hear you made a comeback the other day. Yeah. I'll need your help again. Yeah, sure. But now I'm practically retired. But… I heard a rumor that you'll be returning as president of Sanritsu once again. There are too many irresponsible rumors out there. I agree. I was even gossiping with Tatsumura just now. With Tatsumura? They say you had a dispute last night. That's just another irresponsible rumor. But you better be careful. It's weird saying this to your face, I've always preferred you to Tatsumura. If you ever need help, I'm always here for you. Oh. I'll see you, then. Well, I'll leave you alone for today. This is a fine house for an old fox's nest. And they're even planning to expand the place. SANRITSU INDUSTRIES I see. That old man and Tojima, huh? I think we can still do something about it now. You're something yourself too. What are you after? The Sakura family's territory? Well, if that's on the table. Okay. I'll grant you that. In exchange, get to work. Eliminate the old man. Boss. He's your blood relative. I don't remember having an uncle like that. Murakami. Take the Kijima brothers. Mr. Chairman. These men say that they came from Tatsumura. What do they want? Can't you handle it yourself? No, I definitely can't. What are you doing? Stop it, you! CHAIRMAN OF SANRITSU INDUSTRIES MURDERED Killing anyone who gets in the way? But this is too much! This is exactly how Tatsumura works. Now their organization is strengthened again. We have to find a new way to get inside. Welcome. Can I get you a drink? I don't have any money. Here, let me pay with this. We're supposed to ask for cash. Don't be so uptight. I heard whose restaurant this is. Welcome. Eh? Are you the one I need to talk to? Maybe. We'll see. Boy, where are you from? Check the family register. No comment. Well?! I want a clear answer! Come this way. Here. The pistol. Wait here. MANAGER'S OFFICE I have someone we could use. We heard your story. - Go home for today. - What? We have to check if the gun has been used in a crime. If you can't tell by holding it, then you're an amateur. What? That gun isn't loaded. You're not qualified to be a bouncer. Move! Are you the boss? If you really want to work here, do as you're told. Waving that thing around won't get you anywhere. Got it? Got it. Nice to meet you. The Takeda family controls the bar area here. The bars and cabarets in this area are the Yoshi family's territory. Both are backed by Sanritsu Industries, I'm sure. Just as I thought. So what's the connection between Tatsumura and the owners? It doesn't seem to be just protection rackets. I bet they're into something more profitable than that. Okay. This is their turf, anyway. Let's provoke them one by one. Tojima's taking over this bar. Get lost, goons! Motherfucker! Get him! What the hell, you guys? The Tojima family's taking over this place now. If you want protection money, we refuse! What?! - How did you do? - Good. Ah. Now the Takeda family's stronghold. Let's all go together. - What's that? - I got it from the bar earlier, but there are some weird symbols in the purchase column. Let's check the next place too. Go back and tell your boss. Tojima is taking over this business for a while. It'd be interesting to find a similar ledger. - Let's check around. - Yeah. Somewhere like in here? This is why amateurs are no good. Leave these things to the professionals. It's just been high school so far. Now comes the college class. Find anything? Nothing of value. It's written the same way as this. What could this mean? I'm sure it has something to do with their organization. Six people. Just six people and they're raiding turf all over the place. And what do you want me to do? I'm truly ashamed. Actually, I'm going to take care of this right now. I just wanted to let you know. In that case, leave him be. Let him do his thing for a while. But that's-- Don't you get it? What's a couple of cabarets and bars? The point is to keep our organization unnoticed. Wait and see what they uncover. SANRITSU INDUSTRIES - Hey. - Huh? So what are they doing? They're not moving at all. The car's crying. We'll let it rest while it can. What the hell is going on? He's wearing a Sanritsu badge! Who are you calling? Oh, it's you, bro! Don't scare me! - I was just about to call you-- - Come here. What the hell is going on here? I used my brain a little. Not many people know that you and I are brothers, right? Because we have different last names. So I figured it was up to me to sneak into Tatsumura's place. I told you that you can't. It's too late. I'm in. So you don't want to hear what I got? You got something? Actually, I'm just about to get it. Idiot. You've got me beat. Well then, brother! But be careful, you're talking with the enemy. If you're as careless as you were just now, you're dead. They're totally systematic. In that organization, unless you're a real old-timer, you can’t figure out anything. It seems so. I tried to step on his income streams, but it didn't work so well. I'm sure he's got some big source of money. I'll find it eventually. See you later, brother. All right, place your bets! But think carefully before betting. Watch closely! Here we go. That one. You choose this one? Are you sure this is the one? Too bad! I feel bad about taking from a cop. Okay, one more time! We have a visitor. Hey, stop. They've been going to bars and cabarets for a while. They don't seem to be collecting laundry. What are they doing? Okay, I'll find out. Give me a hand. Hey, can I get a light? Thanks. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, what do we do? What do we do? Good! It's a red light! You stupid bastard, you had me worried. I see. So the dry cleaner was a collector. Yeah. But where is that money coming from? A bag this big with a bunch of bills in it. And instead of laundry, there's a load of whiskey. A Daihatsu Midget, whiskey, and wads of cash… What kind of mystery is this? We’ll have to poke around more. Come on. Come on. I went to see Mr. Ogata. I was hoping to ask Mr. Ogata to stop you. And he told me the truth. You should have just told me. Am I such an unreliable woman? No. This is my problem. I thought I'd washed my hands of the business, but they don't respect that. I had to do it. To break free. I understand. But this is not just about you. Good luck. You're doing a good thing for the world. But… Don't overdo it. ♪ When I lie in bed, there's a man ♪ ♪ When I drink wine, there are two men ♪ ♪ When I walk down the street, there are three men ♪ ♪ They all stare at me, dead ♪ Boss, Tojima is here.

Don't smoke. What? I've got a lead. I'm counting on it. Punch me once. You son of a bitch! What should we do? What's he up to? - Let's go. - Hold on. Wait a little longer. - Check the moonshine. - Got it. I'll leave that to you. Oh, hello! Metropolitan Police? Listen, I'm at the "Night Castle" cabaret! There are drunks rampaging! Yes! Please come! - You're saved by the bell. - It's a draw. Something extra. I wonder if it's just a turf war. No, it can't be. Moonshine. This was the key to their secret organization. So, through the bosses of the amusement quarters they would get this moonshine into bars, cabarets, and clubs, then they paid profit dividends to the shareholders. Then this ledger is likely a record of moonshine sales. I wonder how much money they can make on this. If they put import prices on such cheap liquor, they'll make twenty times as much. - Twenty times? - And it's not taxed. Compared to that, protection rackets are nothing. In any case, we're going to find out where the moonshine factory is. Then we can have them by the throat. First, let's do all we can to find the couriers. Wait a second. What's that? They're collecting empty bottles. So they finally have a job that looks like a job. That's kind of weird. - What? - Those two cars behind us. They've been following us for a while now. Here they come! Hey! That's one gone! Hey! Here they come again! Damn it! That was close. Good job. Hey, Matsushima, what's wrong? Oh! Stupid son of a bitch! Why didn't you tell me sooner? This car was entrusted to me. I can't leave it with anyone. You're stubborn! What's wrong? We got shot at while tailing the bottle collection truck! Call a doctor! If it gets in the papers, they're gonna find out. It's no time for talk like that! Wait. Lay him down over there. Stay sitting. Don't just stand there. Run hot water. Will it work? It didn't work out for my brother. Because it was close to his vital organs. But it's going to be okay this time. Come on, bite down! Harder! Hey! He only fainted. It's done. So their focus is now on the organization. By the looks of it, they're doing a lot of research. Maybe he's a rat for the cops. No way. No way would the cops trust a yakuza. But this needs a thorough investigation. If he's willing to go so far, I have an idea too. I came here today to talk to you on behalf of Tatsumura. So now you're going to join me and take down Tatsumura? Tatsumura wants to have a peaceful talk with you. I'm gonna use this for a moment. Hello. Hey, it's me. Yeah, I'm giving him the phone now. It's Tatsumura. Hello. Tojiima? It's me. I don't have anything to talk to you about now. You might not, but I do. Say, would you like to hear a pretty woman's voice? What? Would you like to say something? She doesn't seem to have anything to say. But you're not an idiot. So I'm sure you'll back off quietly. Don't give in! All you've done will be for nothing! Akiko! Don't worry about me! Don't back off for a second! Akiko! Stop! Got it now? Back off. Hello?! Hello?! Hell-- Damn it! Looks like we're done here. Well, I'll leave you to it. Wait, you son of a bitch! Boss... SANRITSU INDUSTRIES I'm here to see Tatsumura. Stay out of this, thugs. Mr. Tojima. He's waiting for you. Excuse me, but I'll hold your things for you. What's up? Heh-heh. Well… - Sis! - Don't move! Sorry about last night. I didn't mean to make things worse. I just thought our discussion might go better with a woman involved. Well, have a seat. We're not supposed to sit down and talk to each other. I see. Well, let's hear your answer right away. You'll back off, of course, right? I'm not backing off yet. Oh... I guess we had it all wrong. We thought you had a thing for that woman. So you don't care what happens to her? I'd like to ask you something first. Do you have the guts to make a suicide pact with me? A suicide pact? Yeah. You wouldn't have the guts. Because you have too many things. You ruined my business. And you even kidnapped Akiko. Thanks to you, I'm really naked. I have nothing to lose. Not even my life. If anything happens to Akiko, you can be sure I'll kill you. If you think being surrounded by guns will stop me, you're wrong. I swear I'll get it done. How about it? Shall I try it right now? If you don't have the guts, return Akiko immediately. Then you can fight me. Are you so rotten that you can't even do that? Boss, I know who the spy is. Who is it? It's that bastard Kaji. He didn't see me and I caught him trying to save the girl. I tied him up and threw him in the basement. I see… So he was the cop's dog. Or was he your dog? I guess that was a stupid question to ask. Let's ask Kaji himself. Show our guest the way. So you're a dirty rat and you had me fooled, too. I'd like to know who asked you to do it. I just felt sorry for the girl, so I decided to let her go. I'll make you wish that you'd talked. - Idiot! - Bastard! Idiot! It's useless to beat me up. Useless, huh? Wait. That's some nerve you got. Give me the pistol. Tatsumura, I have a request. You're finally starting to understand. He was trying to save my girl. I'm responsible for that. If you're doing this for me, don't bother! I have no connection whatsoever to you. Besides, he's not someone you can negotiate with. I see. Sit him up. Wait. If you're worried about me, mind your own business. I've admired men like you since I was a kid. You've been my dream. Please. Please don't destroy my dream. Stop! Wait. Wait. Finally you're ready to come clean. I don't want to die by the hand of this beast. Mr. Tojima. Shoot me with your hand. Please. Give me the gun! This is one hell of a show. Let me enjoy the spectacle. Come on! Come on! He's dead. That takes care of one of them. Think the next one through carefully. Our guests are leaving. Politely see them out. TOJIMA BROTHERS Damn. They're all over the place. Everyone, just hang in there. But Boss-- If we back off, Osamu won't rest in peace. Akiko won't be pleased either. But with such surveillance! There's still a way! We're disbanding today! What? The Tojima family has disbanded? Yes, I'm sure. I saw it with my own eyes. With him still around, we can't be too careful. Why don't you get rid of all the moonshine we have on hand? Mmm. You'd better get prepared. I'll have the factory moved to the Kansai region. - Shochu with cider. - Sure. Hey! How's it going? What's wrong? - That's weird. - What is? Look. A milk truck at this hour? If it's a courier, it should have an escort. That's it. I'm sure of it. But how do we follow it? Got it! I'll handle it! Hey! What are you doing? I'm borrowing it for a while. Idiot! I'm a cop! We're gonna lose 'em if you talk like that! I'll return it later! There it goes! Are you coming or not? Looks like I have no choice. I'm with you. They're slowing down. It's to see if we're following! They're changing lanes. I'm gonna pass! Okay. Here we go. Let the boss know right away. I'll take a good look at the surroundings. - Hello? - Boss! - Yeah. - We located the moonshine factory! What? It's in the warehouse district at the harbor! Come soon! Everyone is supposed to meet here! Okay! I'll be right there! You. I told you I'd never leave your side. Now you owe me one. Make sure the debt won't be irrecoverable. Great work. Here's a map of the area around the factory. There are entrances and exits at the front and the back. Okay, I got it. Let's split up and go in. Everybody drop your pistols! Tojima. I see you were the cops' dog. Who stabbed us in the back? You were too careless. I'm just trying to learn how to organize the G-men next time. Look, here comes the one you want now. Goro! Next time pick someone who's not greedy for money or women. So... Take our guests to the basement. This factory is closed because of you. If you're going to die, it might as well be in a place with memories. In one hour this place will be nothing but ashes. Along with all of you, of course. Boss. The explosives are ready. Get ready to leave. Tojima. I told you a comeback was impossible. Never underestimate the power of a jinx. Damn it! You son of a bitch! Stop pulling! The debt will be irrecoverable! Boss. We have to do something… You can have your traitor back! Damn you! Damn it! They tricked me! Brother, I'm sorry! They bribed me! I couldn't resist! I'm sorry! Forgive me, everyone! Goro! Brother! Hey, everyone hurry up! Goro! Damn it! Let me do it. I told you... I told you I'm a pro. Goro, hey! Goro! Shoot it open! Damn it, we need weapons! Here. - What about Tojima? - Yes, sir! - Get it done quickly. - Hey! Come on! - Where are they? - Inside! Go! Go! Hello? Hello?! Damn it! Damn it! Motherfuckers! - Are you ready? - I finally got two cars. Okay. Let's go! That way! Huh? - Hey! The back? - We're surrounded. Okay! Head for the gate! Over there! Good, good. Where's Tojima? Go! Hey! Hold on! As I thought. The debt was irrecoverable. Kuroki! Damn! Tatsumura... Get up! Get up and move! Tojima! Tojima! You did a great job! - Because of you we-- - Old man... Three men are dead. Don't say anything now. What have we accomplished? I feel like we've lost more than we've gained. I don't think so. We did the right thing for the first time. Yeah. Even the dead must be happy about that. Let's send them on their way. THE END
