Wait for me, Santiago! Yes Miss, thanks for reminding me... ...I'll see you there in one hour. Bye! Hi sweetie! Hi Jared is nice to see you! Hi Malena, thanks for the favour. Whenever you need it... ...actually you should visit more often... ...don't you think, Santi? SIPPING And... How was school? Well, I have to get some work done if I want to qualify for exams. Is the exam period coming? Mhm... Have you been studying? Do you study in advance, Santiago? Of course, Santi is a very organized boy that's why he always gets good grades. Truth is school sucks. Well, I only enjoy like three classes... ...I come to hang out with friends and for the basketball team. Actually, we won the match today. Did you see, Santiago? Mhm. And you? Why don't you join the basketball team or some other? What sport do you like? Ping-pong. What are you talking about? That's not a sport! Anyway, sports are not in his strengths. Santi, go change your clothes and wash your face... ...and come up immediately to have lunch. Leave your things there, Jared... ...and get going to the kitchen, you are probably starving. Don't worry about us, if you are in a hurry, go. Yes, I have an appointment in 20 minutes... ...and with this traffic I won't make it on time. Well, if you need anything ask Mrs. Silvia. Mrs. Silvia! Where are you? The kids are hungry! I'm coming! Hey, if you like basketball I can talk to the coach... ...so you can join the team. No, thanks. And what do you want to do after lunch? Do you have Play Station, or X-box? Yes, but I need to do my homework first. Sorry, after doing our homework... ...can we take a ride on your ATV? I'm not allowed, unless my dad is watching. Stop it, Jared! It isn't funny! Stop it, I give! No way! You cracked your egg on my head! Oh my lord! Santi! Are you alright? What happened to my little boy? My God! What is this? Your mom's favorite plates! We will help you clean, don't worry. No kid, leave it! You'll cut yourself and they will blame on me. Get out and clean your clothes! Quickly! What a mess... What's wrong? Are you mad? It was an accident, I'll tell your mom... Or will she punish you? I'm going to sit on my bed. Can you move? There's room right here! "Honey bees drill a hole in the corola slipping the nectar... ...the ones with a shorter tongue..." What did you say? Honey bees, what? "Drill a hole, slipping nectar..." Sipping nectar. Honey bees sip, they don't slip. From the verb to sip, it's a funny word. I think you need to practice your ABCs. That's not true! I know how to read. I got confused. Do you want to know how my parents taught me to read? It's fun! How? Hand me my backpack. Where did you get that? From your cupboard. Were you going to steal it? No dumbass! I was going to put it back! You can learn a letter better if you understand it's movement. Now lick it off and follow the shape of the letter with your tongue. That's gross! Is that how your parents taught you? On a plate, of course. Try it! No. Why would I? Just one time. If you don't like it you don't have to do it again. Now the other way around. No. It feels nice, why not? No, I'm ashamed. Don't worry, we can do it on your back if you want. Jared! Your mom is here! O.K Malena! I'm coming! Ehm... Cool bro! See you tomorrow at school! It's amazing, people from all over the world is coming... Hey, handsome. How did it go? All good, Mom! I'm glad. Hi, Santi! Did you just wake up? Oh, my sleepyhead! But listen, I already told Jared he should visit more often! Actually, I need to ask you the same favour tomorrow... ...my seminar ends until Friday, and his dad... ...won't be in the city until late tomorrow. Do you mind? Oh, Come on! We live so close that I would feel... ...offended if you asked someone else. I'll bring him tomorrow too. Great! We better get going so you can go to your dinner... ...you look gorgeous! Thanks, Sara! See you tomorrow, Malena! Bye, Jared! Bye, Santi! By the way... I think you'll need to buy more honey... We finished all there was left... And I love it! Don't worry... I'll buy some more tomorrow. Thanks! How did you crazy guys finish the honey? With dessert.
