(With Love and Gratitude for 2023) - It's good to see you! - Hello! Look who is here. - It's Chun Jung Myoung. - It's been a while. - My goodness. - He's back after a while. It's already brightening here. How have you been? I focused on the works that I liked. I've been working on a drama. I've been well. Did you get a chance to watch I Live Alone as well? - He even won the Grand Award. - I did. Congratulations on winning the Grand Award. He suddenly got up to shake my hands. Last week's episode was the talk of the town, which I'm grateful for. Our ratings were about 9.9 percent high. My goodness. Is this even possible in this day and age? - What's more important... - It's not easy. - We remained in the first place... - I'm so grateful. For the whole year... - in 2022. - My goodness. So we're starting 2023 on a good note. - Yes. - It's really great. We'd like to thank the viewers again. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. We'll work harder. Everything works if Hyun Moo says so. Now... - Why would you say it so bitterly? - So suddenly... Why do you sound so bitter? I've been working so hard to make Ki Family work. This is ugly. Have you given up on recruiting members for Ki Family? - Well, I'm... - Is it still on? I'm getting ready for it. It's an open ending. - He hasn't recruited anyone. - Right. (Rubbing his nose in) But you shouldn't let your guard down. - I mean, Jung Myoung is... - You should get your head straight. You never know what will happen to Jung Myoung. Kian84 might be thinking about recruiting him. - Be careful. - I actually imagined it. (A member Kian84 doesn't want to lose) (The Meticulous Jung Myoung is Back) The Meticulous Jung Myoung. (Humming) All right. Where should I go first? Hello, it's good to be here. I'm Chun Jung Myoung. I feel great to be here again. (Looking bright) How come he doesn't age? His eyes are really bright. - I know. - Right. (He heads somewhere while checking his memo.) Where is he going? Oh, it's Bangsan Market. (Bangsan Market?) Bangsan Market? (Bangsan Market) Is it a market that sells ingredients? I bet they have everything... - in every category. - Indeed. Boxes. So this alley sells boxes. I should get boxes. (Various boxes in different sizes) Right. I should go this way. (I should go this way.) (He excitedly goes in somewhere while humming.) - Isn't that a cake box? - A cake box? It's a cake box. You know those department stores where you can pack gifts? Are you working on something on the side? No. I mean, he seemed quite serious. - He'd get his supplies? - He might be... sticking eyes on the dolls at home. He could be making boxes. - Maybe he's making fake Wilsons. - Fake Wilsons. No wonder he loved Wilson. (Jung Myoung is looking for something meticulously.) I'm here for... Should I say I'm working on the side? - I knew it! - You were right. I became the resident representative for the apartment I'm living in. - What? - It's also called... the leader of a neighborhood meeting. That's Young Gyu. Gosh, this is so old. (The leader of a neighborhood meeting) You actually became the representative? Yes, I became the representative of the residents. That means you were voted through the resident vote. - That's right. - Of course he must have. (The chairman of the administration) (The representative of the residents, Chun Jung Myoung) - Were you the sole candidate? - I wasn't the sole candidate. - There were others. - There were? - Yes. - Then that's amazing. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Captain Chun. - Thank you. It's my first time seeing a resident head. For the residents, I'm making scones. It's to celebrate the New Year as well. What? I mean, the first thing you do as the head is making scones? - You need to give out snacks. - Oh, really? - You need to give them out? - Don't they give out rice cakes? He's giving out scones instead of rice cakes. - Scones instead of rice cakes? - So scones are in trend. - Those are the boxes for scones? - That's right. (He meticulously checks the front and back.) (Checking the feel of the grip) (He's super careful even when he's choosing a box.) (Meticulous Jung Myoung was really careful...) (when he was getting groceries.) (He carefully chooses a box as well.) I think this is good. I think these should be good enough. (Supplies for baking) (He got the boxes.) All right. Thank you. Have a good day. Hello. I need a pan like this. I don't have a tape measure though. Do you have a tape measure I can use? Oh, thank you. (Let me see.) He does have that look of a kid detective. A kid detective? It's the crime scene. ("Jung Myoung's Case Closed") (This pan is 40cm.) (This isn't big enough.) (What about this then? It's 41.5cm!) This is it. I should get this. (He found a pan that suits his needs perfectly.) This is... Thank you. All right. (He goes on to another store.) - What's this? - Art supplies? - Oh, they're food colorings. - Food colorings? - What are they? - There are so many colors. Each store must have different colors. I'm going to make this. I want to make stamps of this doll. - He's making fake Wilsons. - Wilson? - He's actually doing it. - He's doing it. (Jung Myoung's love for Wilson was exceptional.) - He was in love with Wilson. - He adored Wilson. (Save me!) (Leave Wilson alone!) (He's going to make scones in the shape of Wilson!) I think it'll be easier to draw it with a chocolate pen. Oh, this must be more convenient. I'll take these for now. (This time, he gets a scone mold.) Wait, this is in a rabbit shape. This year... - is the Year of the Black Rabbit. - That's right. - You should. - So I thought it'd be meaningful. Hello. Is there a mold in the shape of a bear? A big one. Here it is. - What? - Is this for real? - There are so many fake Wilsons. - There are so many of them. I'll get this. A mold and this. All right. I think I got pretty much everything. I want to look around more. This place is fun. - It's Cheonggyecheon. - There's such a place? (Jung Myoung crosses Cheonggyecheon.) (Bustling) Why is there a line? - What is this place? - What is it? Is it a carp bread stall? - What is that? - What's that? - It's a pie. - It's a famous pie place. - It looks so good. - It looks good. (Pies grabbed Jung Myoung's attention.) Would you like to order? Yes, I'd like to get some pies. I'll take a piece. - A piece of pie will do? - Yes. We'll call your name when your order is ready. - May I get your name? - It's Chun Jung Myoung. - Chun Jung Myoung? - Yes. They were surprised. (They were totally surprised.) - I'm a huge fan of yours. - Thank you. - I've been a fan since I was young. - Oh, really? Thank you so much. Doesn't that happen sometimes? When they ask for your name, you go, "It's Jun Hyun Moo." And they go, "Okay." Doesn't that hurt you so much? - Doesn't that happen sometimes? - It does. - "Okay." - "Okay." - "Please stand in line." - "Mr. Jun, please stand in line." It doesn't affect them at all. Here's the pie you ordered. All right. Thank you. Since the space is tight here, could you wait outside for your coffee? They were such a fan, but they asked you to wait outside. That's a different matter. (Business is business.) - It's a different matter. - She's cool-headed. - Of course. - They had to keep the flow going. - You're so handsome. - Thank you. (Chuckling) - All right. Thank you. - You're so handsome, seriously. (Smiling) (Holding a pie and a coffee, ) (he heads inside the market.) (It's a paradise of food.) (So many delicious things after one another) The mini-gimbap and... Gosh, there's seasoned raw beef. Look at that sundae. The fish cake too. I've been here several times. There are so many good places in the market. Mung bean jeon and meatballs. It looks so good. (Looking glossy) Oh, it's kalguksu. - That was a weekday. - I really want it. - But there were this many people. - There are so many people lined up. - It'll go crazy on a weekend. - I thought it was a weekend. There are so many people. - That's a line? - On a weekday? What is this place? I don't think I can eat at this place. (Where shall I eat?) - I heard every stall is good. - Every stall is good. I should sit here. (The lunch menu Jung Myoung picked...) (is snack food.) My gosh. (It's warming just by the looks of it.) - Drinking in the afternoon? Gosh. - It's nice to drink at such places. Ma'am, I'd like a bowl of noodles... - Oh, my. - And sundae. - And fish cakes as well. - My goodness. Gijang sundae is nice. - Why didn't he order tteokbokki? - That's a nice combination. "Why didn't he order tteokbokki?" Did I get the right items? He did. He didn't get tteokbokki, but he got sundae. - No, he meant for the scones. - Oh, the scones. Yes, I got them all. - Here's your fish cake. - Thank you. - It looks so good. - So that's how it's served. (He drinks from the bowl right away.) Gosh. (It warms up his body right away.) Goodness. He looks like a Japanese office worker. (Korean fish cakes are the best.) (Getting something) (What is he doing with the chopstick wrapper?) What is he doing? - Here. - Thank you. (He made a chopstick holder.) - He made it? - He's definitely in our generation. (With sundae, it's a perfect meal.) (Their sundae is really thick.) (Dipping it a little in salt) (Taking a big bite) (Exclaiming) Ma'am, can I... get a bit of tteokbokki soup? - He's getting it. - I want to dip sundae in it. He should've ordered tteokbokki. Why ask for the soup? Thank you. (Dipping sundae in sweet and spicy tteokbokki soup) She gave me one rice cake out of affection. Dipping it in tteokbokki soup. It was full on the inside, so it was really good. (Exclaiming) - This is so good. - Well done. "Well done?" How come sundae is really thick? The skin of sundae looks so good. Kimchi goes so well with it too. Having kimchi with janchi guksu would be so good. Listen to that crunchy sound. Their kimchi is amazing too. (Glancing) (People next to him are having makgeolli.) - It's makgeolli. - It's makgeolli. He should have a sip of makgeolli. Their kimchi is so good. I think you should try it. (Chuckling) Since you're having makgeolli. (He plucks up his courage to recommend kimchi.) Was he talking to the people at the next table? (Really?) It suddenly looks like "Midnight Diner." Ma'am, can we have more kimchi? (Proud) Their kimchi is really good. (They look more amicable after the kimchi recommendation.) It's not Chinese kimchi. (No wonder.) Yes. Thank you. (Here comes filling janchi guksu.) (Passing out) It's really good when it's served in a paper cup. A small dish in a buffet. - You mean at weddings? - You eat food in small servings. He's making us lose our appetite. What I hate the most are small plates. I have no idea why people use paper cups. Isn't it better on small plates? - Come on. - Come on. It's annoying. If you just throw it in, that's all. Of course. - I shouldn't have brought it up. - You should eat it in a big bowl. They're all condemning me. It looks good. (Slurping after blowing on it) Gosh, it's good. It doesn't taste as nice... - when it's delivered. - It doesn't. Not many places sell that. You must have it at markets. Gosh, he's eating with gusto. Gosh, it's so good. (Having a bite of kimchi) It looks so good. - He's really enjoying it. - It looks nice. He's like us. Would you like to join Palm Oil Family? I love eating. - Really? - Really? - Yes. - I really love eating. - I'll eat well from now too. - He said nothing about Ki Family. - I'll eat well from now too. - I eat really well. I'll eat well too. - I'll eat well too. - I'll eat well too. - You always criticize me... - I can eat really well. When I eat something. I'd love to join. - Then let's hold an audition. - That sounds good. - Let's see how he eats. - Since he likes eating... Let's see how many dishes he can eat. - Let's see how much he can handle. - Why would they audition him... for eating? We can go to a sushi place. - Why audition him for eating? - "He doesn't look confident..." "when eating." Please include a written test as well as a performance test. - At a sushi place, - Palm Oil Written Test. We'll see how many dishes you can pile up. We'll also check the price of them. You need to pile up enough dishes... so you can't see the person next to you. - As high as the 63 Building. - Right. He needs enough dishes to make a separate compartment. That's right. Seeing how he eats janchi guksu, he looks like our family. I think he doesn't need to submit forms. (Touching, looking around) I see. There are heat lines on the seat. Really? How can a bench like that have heat lines? - Like electric pads? - Exactly. It was hot and warm. - Oh, my. - My goodness. It's incredible. (He's done with his warm meal.) Ma'am. It was so good. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. I enjoyed it. Have a good day. (He doesn't forget to say goodbye to the people in the next table.) (After a filling meal...) Shall I head home now? (He heads back home.) (Even while I miss you) What is this? (Even when I miss you) (Ears pricking, focused) I must've loved you. My dear. Wait. - You pass. - You pass. You totally pass. He's such a horrible singer. He passes. (Dropping his head) Palm Oil Family members need to be bad singers? You must be a bad singer. You're such a horrible singer. (They love him.) He's similar to President Jun. - I know. He uses nasal sounds. - He is similar. My vocal cords are right here. ("Never Ending Story" by Lee Seung Chul) He only listens to difficult songs. I told you to go. (If I miss you enough, we'll meet each other one day) (He looks serious, though.) (My goodness) - He can't hit high notes. - He can't. This is embarrassing. (Showing off an unexpected singing skill, ) (he arrives home.) (Getting off the groceries he got) (Closing the doors carefully) (Looking up) Gosh. So he's the representative of the residents at that place. Gosh, the captain even checks the ceiling. Goodness. He looks different. (Captain Chun goes inside after checking the ceiling.) (He's going in somewhere deep.) There are community facilities in our building. And I need to check those meticulously. - Right. That's what captains do. - That's so cool. (He even cleans up the floor himself.) I'm the representative of the residents here. How should I put it? Since I'm a leader now, I have this sense of responsibility. It's been ten years since this building was built. It's been a little over ten years. And it's inevitable... - to have problems here and there. - Right. For this building... where I live, for the residents, - and for the community, - "For the community." - I had to check the place. - He's like... We need to check the place. We need someone like him. That's right. (If something happens) (To someone somewhere) I needed to turn on the fan. - To ventilate? - Yes, it's to ventilate. (A strong energy of Captain Chun) (Checklist for Captain Chun) (Ventilate community facilities.) (He goes deeper inside.) The hidden spots of the staircases. Bugs can be living there. I need to check if there are any problems. And I have to share it in our administration group chat. There's so much to do. (The last spot of Captain Chun's course) - Sir. - Yes. Hello. About what we talked about briefly before... You know the rooftop... - on the sixth floor? - The rooftop? When will it be organized? Will we clean it all at once using another company? Then the sixth-floor rooftop I just mentioned... The security guard might go like this after six months. "You don't have to go that far." - "Gosh, stop already." - "That's enough." "Why do you talk so much?" - "You don't have to go that far." - "It's killing me." "It's tiring for me too." There's a designated company that we call. - We can call them. - Okay. Next question. I'll come back when I have one. - All right. Have a good day. - Good luck. (After going through a busy course, ) (he arrives home.) Gosh, his house is neat. He must have no time... - to mend his dress shoes. - Of course not. Just let it go. He doesn't have time for that now. I should get changed. Let me wash my hands first. He's really neat. - His house is really pretty. - He's so neat. Next, let me clean them. I cleaned the ones... I got from the market to make scones. (He quickly finishes cleaning them and gets to baking.) I heard baking scones is hard. It is. You have to measure everything properly. (Captain Chun takes out the items meticulously.) (Rummaging) (Powder filled in a plastic bag) Did you measure them in advance? - He subdivided them. - They're the ingredients. - You subdivided them? - He needs to measure them now. (A counter filled with ingredients) My goal for today... is to make 70 scones. (Bright, passionate) - Seventy scones? - It'll take so long. Seventy scones? (He carefully prepared the ingredients to make 70 scones.) (Salt, sugar) - It's harder to make it in bulk. - Of course. (He's super meticulous.) - You can never do it. - Right. I can never do it. That's not like us. We're not meticulous. Hard flour, 100g. (Following the recipe he wrote) Weak flour, 67g. (Measuring it precisely in grams) So you can't make it by estimating. You need to measure them precisely. He's like a patissier. (Weak flour, 67g) (Precise) Sugar, 47g. Goodness. I got it at once. Baking powder. - What is "BP?" - Baking powder. - It needs so many ingredients. - It does. A pinch of salt. (Sprinkling) (A master of measurement who doesn't miss a pinch) (Bright) So if you just eyeball them, it won't turn out well? Butter. (Butter, 54g) (The recipe requires 54g of butter.) I got it. - Right, since he's meticulous. - I got it at once. What's your MBTI type? I didn't ask last time. I think it's IFJ... No, it's IBFJ. - IB? - IB? (There's no "B" in MBTI types.) - Hold on. I need to look it up. - I've never heard of it. Why would you look it up like an old man? I can't remember. At least he didn't take out a notebook. - MBT... - He has to look up. - "Hold on. My MBTI type..." - What are you doing? - It's ISFJ. - ISFJ. - "J" means you're a planner. - It's my first time hearing it. - He is a planner. - Right. And "I" means an introvert. He's an introvert, but he became... - the representative. - There are many famous people... - with my MBTI type. - Who are they? You know Jay-Z's wife? - Beyonce? - Beyonce. She's also... If you include foreign stars, don't most types have that many? I think my MBTI type is similar to Albert Einstein's. - Who tested Albert Einstein's type? - How do you know his type? How did Albert Einstein test his MBTI type? - It didn't exist then. - How do we know that? I was lying. I got busted. (Trying to hide) Sugar, 47g. (He continues measuring like the planner he is.) (There are 4 bowls for the dough.) - Oh, my. - Goodness. I'm going to make four different flavors... - of scones. - That's why he measured separately. Earl grey scones. (First, he makes earl grey scones.) (Sprinkling tea leaves) - You added tea leaves? - Yes. - Earl grey. - Yes. (This time...) - It's so much work. - Chocolate. It needs so much effort. - It's chocolate. - That looks good too. I decided to make four flavors. First, earl grey. Second, chocolate. Earl grey and chocolate? I'd like a chocolate scone, please. And third, vanilla jam. And whisky scone. - Whisky? - Like whisky chocolate. - That's how it tastes. - Oh, that? - I like whisky. - You add liquor? So I thought of making whisky scones. I added whisky to the dough. You added it to the dough itself? That looks like a good idea. But the alcohol will be gone. - It will. Only its scent remains. - It will. (Giving variations with 4 different flavors) (Adding milk and cream) (Peaceful and harmless kitchen of Captain Chun) So it needs to be in chunks like that. (He makes a ball with the dough.) He made all that. I could make 6 scones with 1 dough. (He stores the dough he kneaded in the fridge.) - You got 24 scones now. - All right. (He needs to repeat the same process again.) - Right, he needs 70 scones. - For real? I need to make at least 70 to 80 scones. Weak flour, 67g. Sugar, 47g. Butter, 47g. - That looks so stressful. - It makes me dizzy. It looks like he's regretting it. - He looks a little sad. - He looks sad, right? I became very enthusiastic about doing well. And I didn't know it would take that long. - Of course. It takes a lot of time. - He's repeating the work nonstop. Oh, gosh. It looks tiring. It's not easy. The sun is going down. (He's so meticulous that he might pull an all-nighter.) Could he still be making it the next morning? - Right. - That's possible. - "It's 47g, 57g, and 100g." - He could continue the next day. "Oh, no. This doesn't look good." (He might go into eternity while measuring the ingredients!) - My whole body ached after that. - Of course. - I couldn't even sleep. - Right. - I woke up because it hurt so much. - Of course. (He's been making dough for about 4 hours.) He only finished making dough. - Will he put the dough in the oven? - Yes. My dear Wilson. It's sitting there so quietly. - If it doesn't, you'd be scared. - Right. (He adjusts the angle of the chair.) - You see, - He's a huge fan. - I like Wilson so much. - He really likes Wilson. (Lifting up) (He moves Wilson with affection.) Wilson, sit here and watch me. (I baked it for you) Wait just for a while. That song is perfect for this scene. (The scones I made) It took me all day Wilson, look at this. (The scones for Wilson) This is NewJeans' song. (How about a bear instead of a rabbit?) It looks quite good. Indeed. - I wanted to make different shapes. - Oh, I see. I made some round ones. Now, I'm making rabbit scones. - I wonder how those will turn out. - Right. - How will those look? - It's like baking pottery. (Full of expectation) Okay. Done. (He uses the mini oven too as he has a lot to bake.) Okay. Set it to 20 minutes. - Does it take that long? - Yes. (Breathing out heavily) I didn't know it'd be so hard. I didn't know making scones was so much work. (Beeping) (The mini oven alarm goes off.) (Surprised) Oh, is it done? - What's wrong? - Is it done? (How are Captain Chun's scones he worked for hours to make?) (Surprised) - Mini ovens burn food easily. - Oh, gosh. Gosh, what a shame. He made black rabbits. - It's the Year of the Black Rabbit. - He made those to celebrate it. I set the heat too high to bake a lot at once. - You were impatient. - You shouldn't do that. - It doesn't work like that. - I hope these will be baked well. Please. Wilson, pray for me. It'll be successful this time. (Wilson prays for him while watching him closely.) Is it done? (Smoking) - I hope it's not burnt. - That startled me. He'll be upset if this batch is burnt too. - He put more dough in this oven. - Is it burnt? - I think it's okay. - It doesn't look so bad. (Impressed) I think it's baked well. How do the rabbits look? - Okay. - It looks good. Good. The rabbits are cute. Fortunately, I didn't burn the rest. Shall I try it? It looks delicious. (Exclaiming) You should try it. Is it good? Is it baked to the core? (Satisfied) - It must be good. - It's good. There's nothing like freshly baked bread. It looks so good. (He successfully made scones after twists and turns.) (Captain Chun is on fire.) - It must've been so delicious. - Jung Myoung is amazing. He really did all that? (He makes scones for his neighbors with a lot of effort.) He's incredible. (Captain Chun, you're amazing.) (He improved his work efficiency and made scones faster.) - The color is even better now. - The rabbit looks pretty. People might think it's easy after watching this. - Exactly. - Right? - The color is perfect. - All right. I'm almost done. - They look like ones in bakeries. - Indeed. You have to cool it down to stiffen it up. (I should fold the boxes to put the scones in.) I'll start folding boxes now, Wilson. Oh, I see. Okay. (The gift boxes for the 18 families) Okay. One is done. Oh, right. He has to fold boxes by himself. Oh, dear. That's a lot of work too. (He keeps working without a break.) - That's 18. - My goodness. (Now that he folded all the boxes, ) (he takes the chilled scones out of the fridge.) The scones are ready, Wilson. - It's pretty. - It looks good. (He puts vanilla jam on top of the scones.) - That's the highlight. - I see. You put jam on the scones. - Yes. - There should be toppings. I got this jam... (The vanilla jam, his secret weapon from the store he's a regular at) - at the store I'm a regular at. - It looks delicious. (Jung Myoung finished preparing everything.) Let's put them in the boxes. (Finally, he packs the scones.) My, that looks good. - Oh, like that? - He packed different flavors. - That's thoughtful of him. - For each family? (Captain Chun's gift sets of 4 types of scones) What do you think? Can you see I made them with a lot of affection? - Wilson? - Oh, my. (He asks for Wilson's opinion and giggles.) It must have taken him so much time. - Exactly. - It must've been tiring. It takes long to make scones. Let's start writing cards to show my gratitude. - He'll even write cards too? - Cards? - Handwritten cards? - Yes. I think he wants to serve consecutive terms. - I agree. - Yes, of course. (I'll practice first.) Should I call them "householders?" "Householders?" I should check the grammar. (He even uses a grammar checker.) (He prepares everything thoroughly.) I wish you... - He's so meticulous. - Oh, my. (It's simple but heartfelt.) All right. I got nervous since I wrote cards after a long time. - Of course. You get nervous. - Naturally. All right. (Shaking his arm) My hand hurts. - It hurts after writing a lot. - Of course it hurts. - And he made scones before that. - Your hand hurts. - Oh, right. - That's a good point. (Breathing out heavily) Wilson. This is hard. (I feel bad for you.) (But he hasn't finished writing cards yet.) (He writes cards to delivery people.) Oh, it's for delivery people. They'll be so happy. (He's done with all the work including writing cards.) - I'm impressed. - I'm done. He's amazing. It's dark outside already. - That's such a thoughtful gift. - Exactly. (He puts the scone boxes in the wagon cart.) - Now, I'm going to deliver those. - He'll deliver his gifts too. (He prepares to deliver his gifts.) (Struggling) (He brings something out. What could that be?) (Did you prepare another gift?) - Wine? - You prepared another gift? Yes, I prepared wine too. - He likes wine so much. - He will get elected again. I'm sure of it. It's obvious since he prepared wine. They wouldn't vote for him again just because of the wine. I would definitely vote for him. - That's ridiculous. - I'd definitely vote for him. Goodness, you. (Captain Chun came out to deliver his gifts.) Let's start with this house. - His next-door neighbor. - Press the doorbell. - Yes, my next-door neighbor. - Oh, he has next-door neighbor. (He places his gifts neatly in front of the door.) (A bottle of wine, a box of scones, and a card) (He made his first delivery with excitement.) Please enjoy. (He's so sweet.) (And then Jung Myoung moved to the next floor.) (He carefully puts his gifts in front of the door.) Wouldn't it be a nice surprise? - Of course it'd be nice. - It'd be so great. His neighbors must've been so grateful. - No captains would do as he does. - Exactly. (He goes to every floor in the building.) He's amazing. (He makes sure to deliver his gifts to every single house.) Mission accomplished. (Captain Chun's sincerity...) (will get to his neighbors' hearts.) (Jung Myoung came down to the lobby instead of going home.) (He places snacks for delivery people.) I made some extra scones for delivery people. - Oh, you packed each of them. - I see. - My goodness. - I put each in a zipper pouch. - That's so nice of him. - Indeed. - I'm impressed. - He's so thoughtful. I should be kind to others just like him. He's been saying that over the past seven years. (Consistent84) (This time, he's visiting the security office.) (Knocking) - Hello. - He should give them too. - I made some scones. - Hello. Oh, my. It's my New Year's gift. Thank you. I brought you a bottle of wine too. - I hope you like it. - I'll enjoy it. Thank you. - He's happy. - He looks really happy. - He works really hard. - I see. - Please enjoy. - Thank you for this. (Captain Chun finished his delivery.) The other resident representatives in Korea... will be under pressure somehow. Exactly. No one would do that. - I did it because I wanted to. - Right. All the resident representatives, let's keep up the good work. They will all go out to get baking powder. (Captain Chun is the trendsetter among the resident representatives.) (He's back home while feeling satisfied.) I'm tired. I'm so tired. Wilson, it's time to reveal... the long-awaited Wilson Scone. Baby Wilson. (He quickly opens the fridge.) Oh, Wilson Scone? (He shaped a scone like Wilson with the remaining dough.) He's making another one. That's amazing. (Pressing) Oh, you can use a mold like that. I guess it doesn't melt in the oven. - Shouldn't you take it out? - It doesn't melt. It's silicon. It's a silicon mold for baking. (He put it in the fridge to cool it down.) (It's time to meet Baby Wilson.) Oh, my. Could it be shaped just as it is? Is that possible? (Curious) (Carefully remove the mold.) (Impressed) - This... - Wilson Scone. - Wilson Scone. - Oh, my. (Wilson Scone looks quite similar to Wilson.) - But... - There's a crack around its neck. Its neck is slit. (But it has a cut on its neck. Jung Myoung, what is it?) (No, Wilson. Just trust me.) (He presses the scone to attach its head to the body.) (But he failed to fix it.) I think the dough wasn't perfect. And I didn't have enough dough. But this is the highlight, Wilson. (Thinking hard) I'm going to make Baby Wilson. (I'll save Baby Wilson.) It's working. - What? He's decorating the scone. - Oh, my. (He looks at Wilson and then the scone.) - He's drawing the same shirt. - It looks quite similar. - How can he eat that though? - He's an artist. - I found it fun. - It's the same T-shirt. - It was fun to color it. - Look at that. (Let's draw Wilson's shirt to make it more delicious.) (Jung Myoung Patissier) (Wilson, I see hope.) (He colors its arms, legs, and face.) (Full of expectation) (Chuckling) I don't think I can make it work. Oh, no. My goodness. - What's that? - What is he doing? Is it drooling? I ran out of this color. Let's apply blusher and wrap it up. Wilson, this is the best I can do. - Now, the eyes. - It didn't go as well as I thought. It looks bizarre now. It looks so scary. If I were a child, I would be crying. (His mad, beautiful love for Wilson) (No, this isn't right.) I didn't have enough of the color. I needed more white. So I ended up... It's done. (Laughing) Oh, boy. That looks a little strange. - It looks bizarre. - It reminds me of a horror movie. I'm done. - It doesn't look pretty though. - My gosh. It didn't look good, - but it was delicious. - Then that's all that matters. It was a shame that there was no one to share it. - So I made some scones for you. - Oh, gosh. - You mean, that one? - Did you bring that scone? - I don't want that... - Instead of Wilson Scone, - I want the set of four scones. - I don't want that scary scone. - I prefer the set of four scones. - Bring us the smaller ones. Including a whiskey scone. - I don't think so. - My, that's so sweet of him. (He doesn't care what they say and enters cheerfully.) Oh, my. You even gift-wrapped it for us? - He brought the same boxes. - How nice. - He made the same scones for us. - Thank you so much. - Really? - I'm touched. - Thank you very much. - Since the spicy oyster salad... - Since the spicy oyster salad... - Thank you so much. - I really wanted to try those. - They're big. - It looks great. - Thank you so much, Jung Myoung. - Thank you. - It looks so good. - It looks good. - Oh, my. What is this? This is Wilson Scone. - I'm not sure if I want to see it. - Oh, no. Let's have a look. I'm curious. (They'll see the scary Wilson Scone in person.) I did a good job this time. (It'll be revealed.) - Here we go. - Oh, my. - What? - What is this? - What happened? - It's different. - Did he buy it at a bakery? - I'm sure he bought it. No, I didn't. - He bought it. - I made this by myself. - It looks so different from that. - Really? It looks different. - This is... - The nose is sharper. - It's a different breed. - No, I used the same mold. I bet it had plastic surgery. No, I used the same mold. - It had plastic surgery. - It got fillers. It had jawline surgery too. - I'll eat the other side. - That's fair. (Having a big bite) It looks good. That must hurt. - Is it good? - Really? Really? - It's as good as ones at bakeries. - Is it really good? I made some changes. - I'm impressed. - You did a great job. It's a little different somehow. It's so good. It's really good. It'd go so well with coffee. (Gulping down) (All of them are eating while standing up.) He did a great job making the dough. Thank you. - It's really good. - Thank you. (It's time for Jung Myoung who worked hard to eat.) Now, let's have a drink. Cheers. (Cheers to Wilson's eyes.) - Wilson gets to watch a movie too. - Drinking while watching it. I'm sure Wilson doesn't want to go back. It came to my house after that. (Oh, boy) Oh, no. Poor Wilson. It was treated so nicely there, but... It went from the paradise to the fiery pit. Wilson is so cute. - That's hilarious. - My dear Wilson. Shall I try it? (He scoops the leg first.) (He puts it in his mouth.) (Impressed) Wilson, it's good. (Wilson, it's good.) (One more bite) Do you want to try it? Is it strange because it's your leg? How could he tell Wilson to eat Wilson? (Laughing) It's good. (He enjoys Wilson Scone while watching a movie.) What do you think? Is it fun? (He ends his day with his favorite things.) I decided to take up the position as the resident representative... because someone had to do the job. To correct the wrong things, someone had to take up the job, so I stepped up. In 2023, I will work hard... for the common interest. (He's full of passion.) (And those who are working with Jung Myoung) - Are those from your neighbors? - Yes. For the wine and scones, - they thanked me. - That's touching. Is it hard to forget those who didn't thank you? Yes. (He won't ever forget them.) He's holding a grudge. - That's understandable. - He's human after all. (I'm waiting for your texts.) It's good. (He spent the day for others rather than himself.) I'm happy. (Here Goes Captain Chun) (I Live Alone) (Passionate Farewell) "Passionate Farewell?" He's unusual as always. He's sleeping in the afternoon. It's quite late if it's 5pm. I went to my workshop and drew for a while. Then I came home because I had nothing more to do. (Sighing) What's wrong? Is he feeling unwell? (Is something going on with you?) Today is... December 31, 2022. - It's the last day of my 30s. - Oh, no. I'll turn 40 tomorrow. I think I know how he must feel. I feel like time is going so fast. (He'll become Forty84 tomorrow.) - Right. - I can't believe he's 40. (He'll become Forty84 tomorrow.) (He gets up with a heavy heart.) (It's 7 hours before the new year begins.) - His house is clean and tidy now. - Oh, my. (Unlike the old days when his house was messy...) - He's matured. - What happened to you? I can't stand a messy house since I've aged. - I'm surprised. - Oh, my. - Oh, gosh. - I was wrong. I knew it. It's just that he hid his laundry. (He still lets his laundry pile up.) Let me see. (He picks up the empty bottles.) (Since he spotted them, he'll sort his recyclables.) He's become so tidy. It's fun to sort recyclables. - Look at that. - That's impressive. (Kian84 has changed.) (Picking up) Let's wash them. (He'll do his laundry while he's at it.) I'm surprised. I like cleaning the house. I became tidier than before. I can see that. Since I had aged, I didn't want to live in a messy house anymore. So I cleaned my house to celebrate the new year and did my laundry. I wanted to keep my house as organized as possible. And cleaning the house is fun. I learned how to enjoy physical work when I harvested persimmons. I improved after I visited your house, Na Rae. (Compliments motivate Kian84 to work hard.) (Servant84 got a taste of labor.) (In the new year, he'll be a tidy servant.) Why don't you play a recording of Na Rae's voice at home? He knows how to get jobs done. Is this detergent or shampoo? There's no shampoo packaging like that. - Wait. - Do you pour it onto the clothes? Not in the detergent tray? I don't like that. What do you mean you don't like that? That's not the point. - The detergent goes in first. - That's right. And the fabric softener goes in when it rinses the laundry. - Oh, really? - Exactly. But they get mixed together on their own. - Is it clean? Doesn't it smell bad? - It smells good. - Smell it. - It's not so bad. Do you think the fabric has been softened? Well, it's not bad at all. It won't kill me. That's all that matters. - Things are complicated nowadays. - Right. That sounds philosophical. (The Servant's Life as a Minimalist) I should wash this too. That's my work clothes. (CODE KUNST gave him as a gift at his exhibition.) - I wore it often. It's dirty now. - It's covered with paint. - He's just shoving it in. - Right. (He put it in the washing machine without hesitating.) I just have to put it in the washing machine. The surfactants in the detergent do all the work. (Servant84's Laundry List: A fleece jacket, ) (a padded jacket, a coat...) You washed your coat in the washing machine? It didn't shrink. These days, I wash my suit in the washing machine too. What? You can't do that. (It's a culture shock.) (Kian84 doesn't disappoint.) It didn't shrink. Is shrinkage your only standard of judgment? - You were very startled. - I was very startled. Doesn't it wrinkle the suit? When I wear the suit and move around, - the wrinkles disappear. - I guess the fabric is nice. (He leaves the rest to the surfactants.) (He opens the shoe closet.) - Do you wash them the same way? - I had to handwash them. - My goodness. - He is tough. Do you handwash them? I handwash my sneakers. (He washes them with a metal scrubber.) I cherish my sneakers a lot. Once I buy a pair of sneakers, I try to make it last... by handwashing it. Look at his hands. (Scrubbing quickly) Isn't that leather? It looks like quality leather. - Leather? - Is that leather? If you scrub leather like that, the surface will come off. The sneakers are still good to wear. It's stressful, right? - It must be stressful. - This is a bit... He loves shoes very much. He straightens his shoes with a deer bone. I like shoes very much. (He is nearly in tears.) - Really? - The scrubber is too harsh. Still, it's admirable that he takes care of his shoes. It's admirable. (It's time to rinse the shoes.) No. He shouldn't do that. (What did Kian84 do?) (It's time to rinse the shoes.) (He steps on the shoes with his feet.) No. He shouldn't do that. (The manly man's harsh love) (Please don't do that.) (It's a love triangle that brings tears to the eyes.) (He closes his eyes.) (He looks back on the memories he made with his shoes.) - That makes my heart ache. - That way, the detergent comes out fast. Did you have somewhere to be? Why did you wash them so hurriedly? Look at his feet. (This is how the clean servant takes care of his shoes.) He is charming. Look at that. (He puts on the shoes while washing them.) That way, the detergent comes out fast. That's your know-how. (He rinses off the detergent...) (and straightens his back.) My back hurts. It's hard to dry the sneakers. (He comes back to the living room with his shoes.) For goodness' sake. (He takes out a towel from the laundry basket.) (Blowing his nose) Didn't he blow his nose on the towel just now? He is coating the shoes with his snot. - He is coating them. - They are clean. (Please, Kian84.) Don't you use that towel to dry your face? If it's dirty, it's a rag. If it's clean, it's a towel. You have standards. (He dries the inside as well.) Where should I dry them? (Where should I dry them?) The drying rack. (He brings the shoes inside his bedroom.) Don't they smell? The boiler is on high, so it's okay. (He brings something else.) - Flowers? - What are those flowers? (Flowers and glass bottles?) I received flowers recently. - At the entertainment award? - I see. (Two days ago, he received flowers at the award ceremony.) (The Multiplayer Award) (Sniffing) (He smells the fragrance of glory again.) You become sentimental... - as you get older. - It's true. (Do you like flowers?) Now that I am older, I like flowers and similar things. - That's right. - I used to think, "Why do people give flowers when they will simply wilt?" When I asked that question, people said that they give flowers since they are the prettiest... when they are given. Those words made me realize that flowers make a cool present. They will last longer if I put them in a vase. Kian84 changed a lot. I can't believe it. He became so sentimental. Had it been years ago, he would have thrown them away. I know. (He takes the glass bottles to the sink.) (He rinses the bottles in a powerful way.) Flowers shouldn't drink alcohol. I am not used to seeing Kian84 like this. - I know. - He rinsed the bottles. My goodness. (Plopping down) (He takes out the tie carefully to keep the flowers intact.) Kian84 is arranging flowers. My goodness. (He puts them inside the bottle.) Is the opening too small? (Breaking) What was that? (Only the strong flowers survive.) (What was that?) - Goodness. - Just kill them. (He stuck them inside forcefully.) Every bottle has a small opening. (The flowers entered the netherworld of glass bottles.) I didn't want to use too many bottles. - Why is the opening so small? - That will kill the flowers. They are still alive. (Don't worry.) You should have put fewer flowers. I felt bad about putting some flowers... while discarding the others. You pretty much discarded all of them. The sap came out. They are dead. The scrapped surface of the stems was visible on the bottle. It was like peeling off the surface of the sweet potato vines. (Be strong, flowers.) Here comes a soju bottle. - Are you serious? - Just put fewer flowers. (Breaking) My goodness. He broke them. For goodness' sake. (This is a servant's way.) (He displays the flowers in front of the TV.) - Okay. - I fit them inside four bottles. Is this a funeral home? Since they are in front of a black frame... That's the spot I look at the most. Just stick them to your eyes. (Just stick them to your eyes.) His house became so clean. (The Multiplayer Award trophy) Becoming older made me different. He collected many trophies. He has so many trophies from MBC. (He won the Best Couple Award in 2017.) The son of MBC. (The glorious moments...) (flit through his mind like a panorama.) There were many trophies. One part of me is proud, but the other part of me is sad about the passing time. Time passes so quickly. I did the calculation, and it has been eight years. This is my eighth year on the show. (He spent most of his 30s with I Live Alone.) The stars are shiny. (He studies the trophies carefully...) (as he looks back on his 30s.) (He finished cleaning the trophies.) He still does that. Suddenly... My goodness. What's going on? (He enters the laundry room in his birthday suit.) Where did you buy underwear of that color? It's from a designer brand. - A designer brand? - Hold on. Why did you take off your clothes to enter the laundry room? I did it to wash the clothes I was washing. - To wash the clothes. - They needed to be washed. (I will dry the clean clothes first.) (Throwing) (He throws the clean clothes.) He is quite manly today. I know. He neither speaks nor lies down. (He changes into clean clothes...) (and goes back to his workplace.) He is working so diligently. - It's like the army. - Back in the army, I was praised for my work. (He hangs the coat first.) (Collapsing) That happened as soon as he bragged about his work skills. (The 2nd attempt!) (Careful) (As he waits for the new year, ) (he hangs the wet laundry.) I see that grimes don't come off easily. (It's 5 hours 47 minutes before the new year begins.) All done. (He finished doing the laundry.) I will vacuum now. (Vacuuming comes last!) I can't believe it. I wish the cord were longer. Look at how manly he is. He pulled it out powerfully. (He plugs it in powerfully.) (The servant mode) Why is he so angry? Every action flows like water. Why is he so tough today? - He is good at working. - He is really good. He is really good. Look at that. - Look at that. - He doesn't miss a spot. - My goodness. - My goodness. - The cord is too short. - Didn't the dust come out? No, it didn't. - He knows how to get the job done. - Look at him. He never spares himself, you know. (Please save me.) It's like he's dragging it by its collar. The wheels don't function at all. (There's no time. Get up!) (It freely rolls around the floor.) He's amazing. Isn't he just a crazy man? My goodness. I want to give him a job. (He enters the bedroom.) Look at that. (Intense tug of war) That was so tiring. (Finally, he's done.) (He finishes like a manly man.) - Goodness. - Right. - That feels good. - That feels good. But it can hit you in the leg. - Right. - It hits the top of your foot. - It really hurts. - It hurts when you get hit. (The last cleaning session of 2022 ends.) (Kian84 gets ready to go out.) (He wears another layer of pants on top of the jeans.) I've never seen someone wearing another layer on top of jeans. - He wears them like long johns. - Like a windbreaker. (He wears a long padded jacket too.) Where is he going? (He goes outside.) Is he going to a public bathhouse to celebrate the new year? - I already took a shower. - Right. There's no difference. - There you go. - Finally, he gets to ride it. So that's the bike he's been talking about. - That's it. - He bought one. (What's this bike?) - He bought one at last. - It's a new one, right? I rode a bike when I went abroad. It made me feel the joy I had forgotten about. I thought that was it. But I am a little concerned too. All the single men I know... all ride bikes. - Right. If you like a bike... - Right. It's him. - Don't bully Kwang Kyu. - It's Kwang Kyu. (Soon-to-be-forty Kian84 also got a bike.) I got one with greater power. - The color is nice. - It's nice. It sounds really nice. I love it. (Laughing) It's freezing. I think he's going to move up to a Harley-Davidson next. If he gets a Harley-Davidson, he will really be like a forty-something man. - He will. - You will race to your 40s. - Seriously. - Once you do this, it's over. That means I Live Alone... will last very long. - Last long? - That will make the show last long. (He satisfies loneliness with romance.) Nice. (Where did he go?) I booked a photoshoot. - Mr. Kim Hee Min. - Yes. - A photoshoot? A passport photo? - No, it's not. (Studio) I haven't seen a photo studio like this... - in so long. - It's been so long. (It's as if time stopped.) (The photo studio in town looks very cozy.) (Why did you go to the photo studio?) When the first digit of my age changes... When I was 19, I was too busy preparing for college entrance. I turned 20 while drawing. - My goodness. - He's a baby. When I was turning 30, I was publishing "Fashion King." I watched the year turn on the TV... while finishing up an episode. Photos are the only things that remain. When I turn 40, I want to remember my 30s. So I wanted to take a photo of the last moment... of my 30s. I don't want to look good. I want to look natural. Pose naturally. Put your hands your pockets. I will take photos of you doing several different poses. You can choose the one you like. How long would it take to print the photo? About 30 to 40 minutes. - About 30 to 40 minutes. - It's very quick these days. - Will it be framed too? Okay. - Yes. - Nice. - He frames it too? He frames it for you. I didn't get to think about that. Recording the last moment of my 30s. He's taking that off here. - He wore it because it's cold. - The man must've been shocked. It must be freezing to ride a bike in winter. You need it. Look at that backdrop. I haven't seen that backdrop in such a long time. It's like time traveling. (It's all about the model.) It felt really strange. - It must feel strange. - I feel strange. Please tilt your head down just gently. (Like this?) You tilted it too much. - Cute. - Nice. I want to do this. - What is this? - Does it mean the 30s? - It's the last moment of my 30s. - Here we go. - You will remember it this way. - Right. - Great. - Right. He always makes that face. That's the only face I can make. Nice. Nice. (The pose changes according to the flash speed.) Nice. (At 2022 MBC Entertainment Awards, ) (flashes popped like crazy.) (Today, he's not with the others.) Okay. Nice. Nice. - What is that? - What's that? - Bye, my 30s. - I think we're done. It looks like your fingers are making the number 35. - It looks like 35. - It looks like 35. I thought it might be confusing. - That's why I didn't choose that. - Bye. That's a great idea. (He says bye to his 30s.) I think that's enough. - Good job. - Thank you. He got a great customer. You won't take one sitting down and with another background? It shouldn't take long. - You just needed one? - Yes. Come this way. Let me show you. (Do I look good in the photos?) - Have a seat. - Can I see them? (He stares at himself in the photos.) - That's nice. - I like this. It turned out well. (Goodbye to my glorious 30s.) - This one's nice too. - It's touching. I know. I didn't know when I was taking the photos. When I saw it the next day, it felt very strange. You saw it as soon as you turned 40. That was the last moment of you in your 30s. I like this one. - Number 15. - That's nice. - He's like the Statue of Liberty. - Yes. (He waits for the photo.) What time is it? Only 4 hours left in 2022. - This year passed so quickly. - It passed quickly. - It was so fast. - It passed really quickly. Your print is out. - Is it done? Thank you. - Yes. This is it. It's nice. - It's meaningful. - It turned out well. - Thank you. - It's nice that he frames it too. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you for visiting my shop. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Bye. Bye. (Let's greet the New Year.) How will he carry that? He didn't get to think about that. He never thinks ahead. What will he do? Will it fit? - Of course it won't. - It won't fit. - It might break. - Kian84, that's just wrong. - Did it work? - It won't work. - That's too big. - That won't work. It's too big. I am sorry. Have you got any strings? - Is he going to hang it? - Yes. It's okay to hang it. This would do. I haven't seen that string in a while. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (Thanks to the shop owner, he got the lifeline.) (He ties the frame with the string.) Will it not fall? - I'm afraid it would fall. - It's strong. - Is it? - Yes. Maybe it would be gone by the time he goes home. Maybe he will only find the frame. Maybe the wind blew the photo away. "Wait. What is this?" That would be strange. (He fixes it tightly so that it won't fly away.) (Let's go home now.) I will eat and hear the Watch-Night bell. I love the sound. (He goes.) (Empty) Why is there nobody on the street? It was so empty. - It was the 31st. - Everyone must be home. They must be home. It was fascinating to see the streets so empty. (Race84 races through the empty road.) (He arrives fast, thanks to no traffic jam.) It's freezing. (He had to fight the winter wind.) Goodness. (He tries to untie the string.) - He tied it too tightly. - You need... - He tied it too tightly. - Scissors to untie it. (Instead of scissors, he takes out...) It's a key. I tore it with a key. - Key? - Yes. With a key. Bike is good in so many ways. - Gosh. - That works. It's a scene you only see in crime movies. I know. Passersby might misunderstand him. When they escape from being held. (It's cold. Let's hurry inside.) It's freezing. I should've taken a taxi. Why does his dark apartment look so lonely today? It does. Is it because it's the last day of the year? (It's 3 hours 30 minutes before the new year begins.) - I love that photo. - It's nice. (He puts Kian84 in his 30s to the side.) (After getting changed, he goes straight to the fridge.) (Convenience store lunchbox will satisfy his hunger.) (After thinking hard, he chooses.) Kimchi. It's the last day, so he should order good food. It's like faith. I never throw away food. Right. What did he take out from the freezer? (Rustling) (He picks up the scissors from the sink.) (He cuts the bag.) What is that? - You all have that. - What is that? It's the oyster salad from Se Ri. (Oyster salad from Se Ri) (What?) - What? - The oyster salad? (Last time when they gathered, everyone fell in love with it.) (It was Rainbow Club members' favorite.) (It was oyster salad, which was Se Ri's gift.) I ate it for ten days. After eating it for ten days, I still had one-third of it left. I didn't want to throw it away. So I put it in bags. What do you call that? I divided it into smaller bags. I got three bags. You can't eat it after ten days. Ten days is long. Did you freeze it as soon as you got it? No, I froze it after about 8 or 9 days. You froze it right before it died. I can't imagine what it would taste like. What? You can cook it. You won't eat it raw then. - I cooked it. - I thought you were eating it raw. (He took out something else from the freezer.) - What is that? - What is that? I had frozen seaweed soup. (Frozen seaweed soup) I don't remember when I froze it. I'm sure it's less than a month old. I've said this several times. I froze it once. Then I boiled it in water hotter than 100°C. There can't be any germs left. So it's okay. (While the frozen lumps cook...) What is that? (He throws the convenience store lunchbox into the pan.) - That's from the fridge. - From convenience store. It's Kian84's favorite. - Lunchbox fried rice? - Yes. That's good. I added kimchi to it. - No way. - He's the greatest chef. (Instant food meets homemade kimchi.) (If kimchi is too big...) It's going to be so good. He added kimchi. It's from you. Kimchi makes everything better. - Of course. - It becomes kimchi fried rice. (He mixes it passionately.) (It's done.) (Casually placing on the table) It looks good. - It looks good. - It was incredible. (Are oyster salad and seaweed soup melted?) (It actually looks all right.) - Ramyeon seasoning. - Ramyeon seasoning. That would instantly fix it. (He adds ramyeon seasoning.) (Lastly, he adds noodles.) It's seafood ramyeon. Seafood ramyeon. It is. Please put "spicy" there. It's spicy oyster salad seaweed soup seafood ramyeon. There. It looks fine. - It looks fine, doesn't it? - Gosh. - It must be good. - It looks good. (Year-end feast) I wanted to cook it for someone. For whom? - His people. - His people. No. KEY and CODE KUNST, get ready. It's a seminar. (Kian84's food seminar will open.) (Pressing) (He turns on the TV first.) What is this? It feels strange to watch TV on the last days of the year. (You have to watch the music festival in the year-end.) (He digs in.) Let's try it. (He tries the oyster ramyeon broth first.) (Exclaiming) - It's cooked, so it must be okay. - It's good. This is crazy. (Eating the oyster) - It's an expensive ramyeon. - It is. I want to cook it for someone. No, thanks. - Was it really okay? - It was good. I don't eat something that's bad. - That looks good. - That was good too. It looks good. (Slurping noodles with seaweed) I want to eat ramyeon too. - What? - It's an icicle. It's my favorite. Kian84's icicle. (Oh, dear.) You are quick. You suck it up before it drops. I know. He's got the good sucking power. One time, I sucked it up after it hit ramyeon. When that happens, you burn to death. (We laugh to death.) Are there times when it takes the broth with it? The broth comes up. "Gosh!" Is he Maenggu or what? How can it hit the ramyeon? There are times when it's unusually viscous. - Kian84's got a good lung. - He's got a great lung. - He runs every day. - Right. He's amazing in so many ways. My head hurts. In winter, you need to see the icicle. Look how quick he is. (Agility and quickness 100) I would've let it drop if I were him. (He slurps and sucks in mucus fast.) (He successfully manages to slurp the noodles too.) (Getting the towel) I have severe rhinitis. (His last meal of 2022 was filled with mucus.) Gosh, my nose is running. (He drinks it from the bottle.) I wish he would use a glass when he turns 40. It won't taste the same. You should've eaten something good for your last meal of your 30s. I cooked too much. What a waste. There's not much time left. (Just before turning new year, he gets something from a drawer.) What is that? What's that? (What did he get?) - What? - My goodness. Really? (He found a bundle this morning while cleaning the house.) I found a collection of my old phones. That's crazy. He's like me. I'm like that too. I think we are similar. - You have them too? - I do. You will be his next Wilson. (He will replace Wilson.) He will make Kian84 sit and... He's got one more person on his side. When is this from? Will it turn on? It turned on. It turned on. Listen to it. (The slide phone from the past is turned on.) Album. (Fascinated) - Gosh, it was this time. - There are photos. My goodness. - No way. - It's 2007. It's 2007. - Kian84 looks handsome. - It's been so long. I wanted to look cool right after being discharged from the military. (Kian84 in his 20s) Look how sharp he looks. Gosh. (It brings back memories.) You could detach the battery. - Right. That was nice. - Right. It's scary. It's been so long. Where's the start... Start button? - Start button? - It's been so long. - You wouldn't remember it. - Where's the power button? Why is it not turning on? It turned on. - It turned on. - It turned on. It works. Mailbox. I've got 90 messages. It was scary reading them. "Spend the last night before entering the army well." "It will be like a dream when tomorrow comes." It's the day before I enrolled in the army. February 1, 2005. No way. - You still have that message? - Yes. I canceled it just before joining the army. (He takes a trip down the memory lane with his old phone.) - No way. - I should look for mine too. That's a treasure. "Let's meet up, Honey." My girlfriend. (It's a message from his ex-girlfriend.) (I can't read it.) I can't read it. (But I want to read it.) (He saw the message from his old phone.) I can't read it. (He saw the message from his old phone.) "It's always like this." "What is this situation?" "I don't want to see your face again." "Do whatever you want." (They broke up.) Why didn't you treat her better? You lunatic. (You lunatic.) Why didn't you treat her better? You trash. (Give me a collect call.) "Give me a collect call." (Do I like you?) I was so bad. Don't approach me if you are going to hurt me. (I sometimes cry.) What is this? (Be good, you fool.) (That's enough for me.) I should destroy this phone. Don't break it. - Be good when she's around. - I can't throw it away. - It's memory. - Right. - A calendar. - For the new year. (Let's hang a new calendar with a new mindset.) You should change it to I Live Alone calendar. This year's calendar turned out really well. You are going to see my artwork. Gosh. (January is President Jun's painting.) The artwork I hate is featured in the first month. (Even if he hates it, he has to see it for a month.) - Say that only to yourself. - Right. He said it quietly. - He can talk. It's his place. - Of course. - Why can't he say that? - He was alone. (Next, he hangs his photo.) Nice photo. It looks nice. It was the first photo I hung. (It's 30 minutes before the new year begins.) Just 30 minutes? His 30s will be over in only 30 minutes. - Goodness. - It's no big deal. No. It's weird. It does feel weird when you enter a new decade in age. It does, but... (I'll wait, watching TV.) (He sees Hyun Moo on TV.) Gosh, Hyun Moo is always on TV. - He's everywhere. - I thought so too. It's the end of the year. Why doesn't he get some rest? He's still working. I turned on the TV and saw Hyun Moo too. - I thought, "He's working again?" - I know. - It was admirable. - He doesn't rest. Hyun Moo, stop working and take a break. He appears everywhere like Hermione. He changed the channel right away. (After seeing Hyun Moo, he keeps flipping channels.) There's Hyun Moo again. He's on every channel. Goodness. (Hyun Moo is so busy.) Oh, my. It's Seo Won. My gosh. How is Seo Won doing? - I miss him. - Shouldn't we visit him? - We should. - We really should. (Never stop waiting for us, RF!) (After seeing RF...) It's our show again. How many channels is our show on? It's impressive. He has to choose a channel. He will keep flipping channels and miss the countdown. I think I was so nervous that I kept changing channels. You should settle on something. I couldn't watch the countdown. - You were too nervous? - Yes. (He ends up on the channel with the New Year's Eve bell ringing.) We'll be joined by Cho Gue Sung... who scored in the World Cup. It's Gue Sung. He's amazing. He was invited to the bell-ringing ceremony. So many people went there. - He's the best. - It was so cool. - He's so popular. - He was the best star of last year. He watched Gue Sung three times longer compared to when I was on TV. - He's so cool. - Gosh. (Resting) (It's a little uncomfortable.) (Stay in the corner.) - Oh, no. - Why are you mean to Wilson? It annoys me. - In the corner. - Oh, dear. I feel so bad. (I miss you, Jung Myoung.) Four minutes are left. (It's 4 minutes before the new year begins.) He keeps changing positions. - Oh, my. - He must be feeling weird. My goodness. My 30s will end... in four minutes. - Oh, dear. - Gosh. I'm jealous of Gue Sung. He's still in his mid-20s. Goodness. I'm suddenly mad. - Is it that sad? - My gosh. I thought I'd feel nothing and be okay with it. But honestly, I hated it. I have a deep yearning for youth and young days. That's why I kept drawing stories... about young people... such as high school kids, college students, and soldiers. I personally think there's nothing better than youth. Well... (He doesn't want to say goodbye to his 30s.) I like being in my 30s. Did you feel that way too? To be honest, I did too. When you were turning 40? I worked a lot at the end of the year because I felt off. - You don't like it for some reason. - You kept yourself busy. I thought I'd be so sad if I stayed at home alone. - That's why I decided to work. - I see. It just feels different. As soon as I turned 40, something hit me. And it's been that way every year. - We'll go through it at some point. - Right. (As Na Rae will turn 40 next year, she's also worried.) Let's not see it depressing. - Okay! - Being 40 is okay, guys. Why do I suddenly want alcohol? (As he's about to turn 40, he wants to drink.) - I thought he'd be indifferent. - I know. I thought he didn't care at all. I guess it gets you really nervous. I can't take this sober. Right. Drink, Kian84. Get a drink. You can't stay sober. I couldn't stay sober. (People are excited about the new year.) I feel... - so confused. - Being 40 is not that bad. Being in your mid-40s can be hard though. (Why is it so hard to open it?) (Struggling) (He opened the bear by force.) Why is he drinking wine like that? (The last beer he drinks out of the bottle in 2022) It's not like you're in a pub. - It was a wine. - I feel like crying. (Time already flew by.) One minute left. One minute. Goodness. (You and I were bound to split up.) Oh, my. Why do you make it so sad? You can be happy about it. - You will know when you're his age. - You'll know when you turn 40. (The 2022 New Year's Eve Bell Ringing Ceremony) - Nine, eight... - Nine, eight... My young days are over now. They're not over. They say you look good and mature when you're older. I don't even like that. - Seven, six, five... - Seven, six, five... Gosh. Goodbye, my 30s. (The 3rd stage of separation, I accept our breakup.) - Four, three, - Please don't go. - two, one. - Please. Don't come! (The 4th stage of separation, I can't say goodbye like this!) Do not come! Oh, no! (Please don't come, New Year.) Don't come. The bell is ringing... signaling New Year 2023 and giving us hope. I don't want to age anymore. (That'll be me next year.) (The 5th stage of separation, Do we have to split?) - It was that sad? - It's not that I hate getting old. - I just... - Yes. - Are you just sad? - I just want it to stop. (Saying goodbye to 39 was harder than usual.) (New Year 2023) I heard... your 40s are the best decade of your life. He's breaking down because he feels like his youth is over. - Right. - He just hates that fact. When people refer to young people, - they're in their 20s and 30s. - Right. I'll be included in people in their 40s and 50s. I won't be grouped with young people. Just go through it. We'll never know until it happens to us. - Not at all. - I was irritated. What's going on with her? - What's wrong, Na Rae? - Do you want some food? (Nodding) - Eat more scones. - Right. Give me the scones. Let's just order fish roe soup for her. I'll shave my head on New Year's Eve this year. - Are you sure? - You have to keep your word. I will. - We'll see if you shave your head. - Okay. I'll say goodbye to my 30s like that. (She suddenly made a promise about turning 40.) (4 minutes into the new year) (My youth) How old is Hyun Moo now? Come on. - That will comfort him a lot. - Right. He turned 47. Kwang Kyu turned 60. You rascal. He's far from 60. I should set Kwang Kyu up with a good person. I should get married too. (Look who's talking.) He can't sleep. Oh, my. (After tossing and turning, he picks up his phone.) I wish I was around 30. (He listens to "Around 30" at 40.) It should be changed to "Around 40." If he's so sad about turning 30, how am I supposed to feel about being 40? Turning 30 back then... - must be similar to turning 40 now. - It's the same. (Another day passed) (I thought I would stay young) (Kian84 at 33) He was young. (The new year will come back) (Where are my 30s?) (I didn't mean to let them go) (I didn't leave them behind) Everyone, Happy New Year. I love you all. I wish you good luck this year. (Hee Min who turned 40 year old...) (calmed him down with the song and fell asleep.) Why didn't you invite your friends? - That doesn't really help. - Is that so? - Really? - Yes. That doesn't do anything. (An alarm breaks the silence of the early morning.) Why is it going off that early? (The current time: 4:40am) Oh, my. (Getting up) What a man. He's naked. He looks like a mermaid. (The mermaid gets dressed up.) Where is he going? (He left home early.) - Hello. - That's amazing. - Really? - He woke up early. How long will it take to Jebudo Island? Jebudo Island? - You're going to Jebudo Island? - It'd take about an hour. - An hour? - It's not that far. I turned a new decade. I'm going to my favorite place, Jebudo Island, - to see the sunrise. - That's impressive. Generation MZ sees the sunrise on the west coast. The sun rises about seven minutes earlier on the east coast. But young people are wise, so they don't care about the seven minutes... and see the sun on the west coast. The east coast is too far away. You went there because it was close, not because of young people. (Embarrassed) Gangwon Province is too far. - It's far. - It sounds like a good idea. - Right. - He's right. I never thought of that before. (Proud) (He leaves for Jebudo Island to see a special sunrise.) It feels... completely different for some reason. Is it because I entered a new decade? (He feels weird to be in his 40s.) (I get it.) (I'll just sleep.) There must be many people. - I think so. - Yes. (Forty84 catches up on sleep.) (He arrived on Jebudo Island.) Sir, will you drop me off here? - Thank you, sir. Happy New Year. - Thank you. - It's bright. - The sun will come up. It brightened up so quickly. - Right. The sun rises quickly. - I know. The sun is not up yet, right? - Will it be possible to see it? - It's about to come up. (He starts walking for now.) I should go over there. It's nice to be outside. There are more people than I thought. (The beach is full of people.) - Look at the crowd. - Many people are here. - That's so many. - They are so diligent. That is many. A lot of people came to see the sunrise. - I see many young people too. - There were many. (People gathered holding hands with their family and friends.) (Kian84 came alone to welcome his 40s.) (But he doesn't look that good.) - What's wrong? - Is the sun already up? Why does my stomach hurt? What? - It reminds me of Na Rae. - Hold on. He might have to see the sunrise in the bathroom. No way. Wait. What should he do? - My stomach hurts. - It must be the oysters. - It's the oysters for 100 percent. - I'm sure. There's not much time left. (The sunrise: 7:47am) - The sun will rise soon. - Only ten minutes. (The current time: 7:37am) I only have ten minutes left, so I can come back quickly. - No. - No. You have to handle your upset stomach right away. I think he has to poop his pants. Why would I do that? (He dashes not to stain his pants.) How can it happen so quickly? Hurry up. It must be the oysters. - It's the oysters. - The oysters. He shouldn't miss the sunrise like that. I think... the oyster soup I had last night was the problem. You should finish oysters fast. They helped increase bowel movements. I took care of it immediately. Some people were also handling the situation in the bathroom. (Some people were also in the restroom.) When I got in there, it was like a battlefield. (I know that pain.) When I saw the sign "occupied,". I felt fellowship. I felt like they were fellow soldiers. It's coming up. (While Kian84 is in a battle, it gets brighter.) That's a relief. - The sun is not up yet? - Not yet. - It can rise all of a sudden. - Right. (He's happy that the sun is not up.) - How satisfying. - He's happy. It makes me laugh. It's not up yet, right? My stomach feels good on the first day of the new year. (Looking around) What time is it? We have seven minutes left. "Maebawi..." Okay. (He checks a good spot for the sunrise.) (Where is it?) They have a good sunrise spot on the west coast. Of course. (He came to the best sunrise spot on Jebudo Island.) - That's nice. - It's a beautiful spot. It's here. - Oh, dear. - It's right here. The sun will come up between them. - I'll welcome the new year here. - Is this the sunrise spot... - on Jebudo Island? - Yes. Now, one minute left. (Anxious) I might not be able to see it because of the weather. It's a little cloudy. - He might not see it. - He could miss it. The sun could be already up, - and he couldn't see it. - He couldn't see it. It's about time. (It's finally sunrise time!) It's not coming up. It looks cool. That place looks awesome. (The sun is not rising on time.) (He checks the time.) It's past time. (It's past sunrise time.) (1 minute since the sun rose) It's an expert. Sir, do you know when the sun will show up? It'll come up in about 5 to 10 minutes. In 5 to 10 minutes? Really? - It's not the exact time. - My feet are freezing. (Forty84 bundles himself up, waiting for the sun.) Won't it come up? What if it's not coming because I said so? - My goodness. - I told you. - Goodness. - It suddenly pops up. - Look at that. - It looks like a nail. - It's rising. - Really? - It's beautiful. - It takes patience. (The 1st page of Kian84's life at 40) Look at that. It's so good to see it. (He's now happy to be in his 40s.) (I should take a picture of the 1st sunrise in 2023.) It looks like this in the picture. (By Kian84) - That's a good picture. - It's a good spot. It came up looking like a nail between the big rocks. It looked like the logo of a cooking oil company. - A cooking oil company? - Yes. It started to look like a hwatu card. A hwatu card. I know that card. (He lets things go and forgets about all his worries.) It looks awesome. (Kian84 will write a new chapter of his youth.) Seeing the sunrise really touched me. (It gave him good energy for 2023.) - I liked it. - Thanks to Kian84, - We saw the sunrise. - We saw the 1st sunrise of 2023. He's become the Ki Family. - He fell in love. - He did. - He became the Ki Family. - Thank you. (Kian84 suddenly calls someone.) Is she asleep? I look so much older overnight. He became a good son. He's a decent man now. Hello. - She was awake. - Happy New Year, Mom. Thank you. Happy New Year, son. I'm on Jebudo Island. - Jebudo Island? - Yes. I wish you good luck this year. Things will go well. It will be great this year as well. Thank you. Stay healthy, Mom. - Thank you. - Bye. (He wished his mom a happy new year.) My mom looks old now. (Turning) Can you take a photo of me? Can you use my phone? - Your phone? - Yes. - Take a full-body shot, okay? - Okay. The sun should be in it. (He asked a boy to take a photo of a full-body shot with the sun.) (Concentrating) - Is he showing four fingers now? - Yes. Yes. I went with four. - Do I look good? - Yes. Let me see. (He checks his photo as if it was a mission.) (A full-body picture with the sun) He's good at taking pictures. Can you take another one? I don't like this. (His 2nd photoshoot) He took off his jacket. (Serious) Okay. (Hesitating) Can you... - Come on. - Put me in the middle? - In the middle. - Yes. Thanks. He's being so picky, asking for a favor. (I'll succeed this time.) Good. (Time to check the answer) You're a good photographer. Finally. - He did a good job. - It's a good photo. Let's take one together. (He takes a picture with the kids who helped him.) When I was little, I thought living a short, fancy life was cool. So I always admired those people. People like super rock stars... who are hugely famous, make fans go crazy, and earn a lot of money. I thought they were so cool, but I don't think so anymore. I want to live a long, ordinary life. - Right. - He's old now. That's what I want. My goal has changed. (He lets his 30s go...) (when he wanted to achieve something big.) (Now he wants small things that make him happy.) (His new youth in his 40s will be different.) (Let it be healthy and humble.) (The sun is beaming with hope.) It's stunning. (His every day will be beautiful and shiny.) I hope everyone gets good energy this year. Thank you so much. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. Forty84, what's your New Year's resolution? Will you accept me as a Palm Oil member? We're not hiring. Do you ever hire? Yes. Jung Myoung recently joined us. - Gosh. - Right. We're full now. Convince Jung Myoung now. - Well, we have gatherings. - I see. - We'll invite you some time. - Okay. We're always recruiting. (The Ki Family is always looking for members.) - You don't really have an identity. - Right. - You're always recruiting. - We have one Ki Family member. - For sure. - We got one member for sure. You certainly got one member. (Next week) (The Palm Oil Family has been on a roll.) (Kian84 decided to form a team...) (to keep the Palm Oil Family in check.) (The Ki Family) (He's excited to welcome...) (the 1st Ki Family members he invited on the spot.) (The Ki Family is off to have a retreat!) (You guys are happy, right?) (Eat before building teamwork.) (Sweet) (This is what a captain does.) (The Ki Family is oddly kind.) (Isn't it fun?) (Captain Kian84 reads a congratulatory message...) (to get their family retreat started.) (First, I got something for you, Ju Seung.) (Crack walnuts with your head!) (Am I cracking walnuts or my head?) (Then they play 3 strongman games.) (I quit.) (Why aren't they happy?) (He tries to change the mood by playing outside.) (Captain Kian84 introduces mini-games.) (Is this a training center?) (I have to change their negative opinion.) (Going into icy water is the best way to foster teamwork.) (It hurts!) (They grow friendships in cold water.) (A Dangerous Invitation to the Ki Family Retreat) (The actor who appeared in a music video of IU's) (He made his mark with his acting in "The Golden Spoon.") (Living alone for 5 years) (Actor Lee Jong Won) (Welcome to Jong Won's house.) (It's full of Jong Won's taste.) (He won the Rookie Award with his amazing acting.) (It turns out...) (he's the most positive person at home.) (Flinching) (Even though he chews his cheek, ) (he's happy since the food was good.) (Now that I'm full, I'll go out.) (He takes photos with a film camera around his neighborhood.) (I almost missed Mount Nam.) (He even develops and prints photos.) (He's serious about photography like an expert.) (It looks as dark as my burnt passion.) (Rattling) (Most importantly, he stays positive.) (I'm surrounded by positivity.) (I'm an Optimist)
