JULY AUGUST PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS A film by Eitan Green Indoors Doron, Doron! What are you doing? He peed on me again. Oh, come on, enough already. - Did you fall asleep in the living room? - Yes. It's okay, I had to get up anyway. - How about going back to sleep? - How can I with all this pee on me? Look, you peed on the wall too. I was sure I was in the bathroom. That's what you always say. Really, Doron, you're 14 years old. Doron, go to your room, sweetie, go to sleep. I'll come say goodbye before I leave, okay? -Okay. It's no use getting mad at him, he fell asleep in the living room. He's not used to the apartment and he's stressed out because of my trip... I'm stressed out too but you don't see me peeing on people. You and this trip of yours, I'm telling you, he's a sleepwalker. He should see a doctor. He doesn't need a doctor, he gets confused, that's all. Don't make such a big deal out of it. And stop saying "this trip of yours" all the time. Look, his costume is here. The hat, the pants, the poncho and the boots. Dad, can you drive me to school? I have practice at 7:00. Alright, sweetheart. That Dolberg is always telling me to go in and pass the ball out. I'm the best shooting guard on the team. At Kiryat Yovel I shot as much as I wanted. - Even Shmuel says I should throw more. - Well, if Shmuel says so... - But is Dolberg a good coach? - He's okay, he's not... he's no basketball coach, he's just a gym teacher. And a history teacher, ever heard of such a thing? He gave us a project about the Holocaust. The Holocaust? The entire Holocaust? The concentration camps. We have to choose a concentration camp and write a paper about it. - I'm writing about Buchenwald. - Why Buchenwald? Everyone else took Auschwitz. Give me a kiss. Are you okay, Dad? Let's have some fun. How long is your vacation? Two days. Salim, hold on, I'll be right with you. When will you be home? - At 6. I have a Purim party tonight. - Yes, I know. I'll be home by 6. Bye, Doron. -Bye. Salim. Alright, I told you yesterday that I'll bring the money. Alright, don't worry. I said I'd pay and I will. Bye. Doron! Your keys! What? -Your keys! Dad, watch out! Doron... Are you insane, opening the door like that? - I'm so sorry, I didn't see you. - Doron, help me up. -I'm sorry. - Are you alright? -I'm fine. - I'm so sorry. I'm Doron's dad, Avraham Nawi. I'm so sorry. -Yechiel Dolberg. - You're the gym teacher? - And History. Defense, guys! Defense! - Over here, over here! - Give him the ball! Block the middle! The middle! Go, come on. Doron, Doron... Stop, come here. Give me the ball! Where are you going?! Huh? Where are you going?! How many times have I told you, pass the ball and go to the other side. Play what we practiced. Besides, what happens when you go to him, huh? - Want me to remind you? - I bring my man with me, but... No buts! You bring your man with you, period! Didn't they teach you that? Come over here, come. Did she go already? Dassy? Yes, this morning. - Where? - Romania. Two doctors and a nurse, Dassy. They're helping children over there. Good morning, Salim. -Good morning, how are you? -Thank God. -Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You owe me and Tawfik another 10, you remember, right? Alright, don't worry. People will live here. They'll walk through these rooms. A family, two kids... A room for each. We're doing something here, Avraham. We're building homes for people. It amazes me every time. Tell me, - how's it going on Neviim st.? - They're pouring the concrete on the second floor. Excellent, excellent. Yiftach, we have to set up the meeting about the building here, I've been financing it myself and the bank... Don't worry about a thing. We'll work together a lot, Avraham. - Good job, Avraham. - Thank you. Yiftach, how much does that car cost? Mine? Why, you want to buy a new car? At some point, yes. I want something more spacious. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Hey. -Hi. Great costume. -Yours too. Did you know that LeBron James, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade... Look at this. A building rising up from nothing, from the ground. Ultimately people will live here. Kids will play in the rooms like it was always here. This is great. But we have to pick up the speed and finish casting on the third floor. Then I'll be in a better position when I meet Yiftach next week and... - The bank is suffocating me. - Alright, don't worry. Mom! Hey, Doroni! How are you? - Dad, come here, Mom's on Skype! - I'll be right there, someone's buzzing. Stop it! How are you, sweetheart? How's school? How did they like the costume? Everything's fine, Mom. It was O.K. Hey. -Hey. How are you? -Fine. Under pressure, as usual. - As usual. Any special reason? - No, never mind. How are you? I'm fine, working hard... Hey, sis. What are you doing in Buchenwald? What?! -You're right in the middle of a picture of Buchenwald. I'm doing a paper on the Holocaust so I have a picture on my computer. What's up, Shmulik? I only see your stomach. I'm fine, monkey. How are you? I see you clearly. If you bend down she can see you, the camera's here. -Oh. Shmuel, how's it going? How's Orna? How are the girls? Getting more religious, thank God. How about you and the primitives over there? They're asking about you. - I'm fine. We just started. - Hey, there's Eli Wiesel! -Where? What? -Who's Eli Wiesel? - Ouch! Shmuel, cut it out! - Be quiet. Eli Wiesel is in the photo, seventh from the left. The greatest holocaust survivor ever. "Who is Eli Wiesel?" Shame on you. Shmuel, Doron, how about letting me talk to Mom? Doron, don't go yet. Avraham, you can talk to me later. Talk now. Bye, Mom, I'll call you later. Shmuel, let's go upstairs. Hey. Again, push harder. Remember, the guards' rebounds make all the difference. Goddammit... I've been waiting to eat a normal sandwich. You said push harder, didn't you? What's in the sandwich? - Salami with butter. - I'm telling Orna on you. -Fuck that. - Ew, that's gross! - You shut up. When's the finals? The semifinals are in 2 weeks, I don't know when the finals are. Then we go overseas, God willing. Making fun of me, huh? Here, girlie, dribble. Look at me. You're in 9th grade, it's just the regional championship and you're thinking overseas? What'll you do in the premier league? Fly to the moon? Left, you noodle, left! Left! Very nice. Where are you going? I don't know yet, every year it's a different country. Besides, what do you care? I want to accompany the team. How's that? I think your Dolberg doesn't know anything about basketball. Shmuel, Doron, stop all the banging. I can't work like this. - You done talking to Mom? - Yes, but I can't work - with that ball pounding on my head. - We're done anyways. Come, Doron, I have two patients waiting for me at home. -Hold on a minute. I want to take a picture of the roof with you playing on it. Good place for the basket, huh? Dad, what's that? Your grandparents' house. It's always been here. No, what's next to it. It's a model of a building I was supposed to build. I took it from their office. - Nice, huh? - Yes, will it look like that? I don't know, I never heard from them again. Did you want something? Yes, it's about my paper. Dad, can I say that I'm a 3rd generation Holocaust survivor? 3rd generation survivor? How? I'm Iraqi. Did you forget? And Mom and her parents are from Argentina. Maybe some brothers of your grandfather on Mom's side were from Poland. Maybe. So I can't say I'm 3rd generation if Mom's uncle was in the Holocaust. Maybe. If you insist. Maybe we're all 3rd generation. Ido's parents are 2nd generation and his grandfather died in Auschwitz. Really? Way to go, I do. Dad, can you make me a model of Buchenwald? - What? - A model. I have a drawing of the camp with the barracks and fences and we all have to send a project to Yad Vashem. Ido's mom made him a gas chamber out of clay. - She's a ceramist. - You don't say. You're taking this project real seriously, huh? Yes. What? When did it happen? We'll be in touch tomorrow. Where are they now? Yusef and Rami are in surgery, Tawfik broke his leg. - Are you going over there? - To the hospital? Sure. I was waiting for you. Call me when you get there. We'll stop all the work until the inspector says otherwise. I spoke to him on the way here. Two weeks later - Dad, I'm leaving. Are you staying home? - Come in. I woke up at 5:30 and started making this for you. - Good job, Dad. - Just wait until it's finished. Not again... Don't worry, I'll put an end to this. You've been saying that for 2 weeks. I think someone followed me after school yesterday. -Followed you? Don't worry, Doron, no one knows where you go to school and no one was following you. When will we tell Mom? I'll tell her, today or tomorrow. - Besides, why aren't you calling her? - I don't feel like it. What will I say, that workers are stalking us? You have a game tonight, right? At 4:00 PM. Semifinals. I'll be there. That's okay, Dad, Not many people are coming... Shmuel said he'd come, and he'll drive me home too. I'll be there. I haven't seen you play in a long time. People have been waiting for over a month. What? They're coming to my home. Yes, but Yiftach... When will you call? Call, don't forget. Okay, bye. Leviko - hardware store - Listen, Salim, there's a kid here. Of course. As soon as I have something you'll get it. Maale Edumim, nothing. No, Bet Shemesh aren't getting back to me either. Okay. Bye. Here. Don't make me come here again. Debts have to be paid, buddy. Your debt is growing. - Defense, you pussies! - Hey, hey. He scores whenever he feels like it! Defense! Defense! It's in my blood, Avraham. I have to get up and yell - otherwise I don't enjoy the game. - Go, Doron. To Doron! Out! Go, defense, defense, defense. Defense! So, what happened with the car? You got in trouble, huh? Now you're keeping secrets from me? You in trouble with someone? Tell me. Forget about it, Shmuel, focus on the game. Foul! Ref, you faggot! Can't you see he's grabbing his hand? Ref! - I have a splitting headache, I have to go. - Wait, do you have your cell on you? Give it to me. Why? I want to take pictures of him, my phone camera's crappy. Nice. I'll show Doron to the girls when I get home, Orna too. You can show Dassy when she gets back. I can show Dassy now, - right here. - Oh yeah? Dassy? - Dassy, can you hear me? - What? - We're at Doron's game. -Avraham... - Wait, I'll show him to you now. -Avraham... I can't hear you. - Avraham, I can't see him. - Number 7. Look. - Dassy, look at Doron. - I can't see him. - Give it to me. -No. - Give it here a second. Who is that? Shmuel? I see him now. Nawi, go to the basket! Dolberg, you know nothing about basketball! Let the kid throw! You're killing him! - Can you see, Dassy? - What's going on? -Dassy. - The picture moved. - Can you hear me? - I can't hear with all the noise. - Hang up, I'll call again. - Shmuel's giving me a headache. - Avraham, let me see him. - I'm calling back. - Avraham... - I want to see him. - I'm calling right back. Substitution Doron, Come here! What? Come here. Leviko - hardware store - Avraham, why did you hang up? Where are you now? Outside the gym. Did something happen? I wanted to see a bit more. I couldn't stay in there any longer. Listen... I... I didn't want to tell you, but... I wasn't even going to call you, but Shmuel... he... Never mind. Dassy, how about coming back? I'm sorry, but can you please come back? I'm in this financial mess at work and... I can't do this, I feel... You're kidding, right? That's why you called? You told me everything's fine. I didn't want to worry you. I waited, but now it's a mess and it's getting worse, my checks are bouncing... People are coming at me from all sides. It's hell. This is not right, Avraham. It's not fair. I mean it. Couldn't you wait with this? Dassy, I told you, I wanted to. I waited, then suddenly... "Suddenly?" What are you talking about? So you have pressure at work, so what? I can't take this anymore. You ask too much of me. I told you a thousand times and I'll tell you again, all those projects of yours, your parents' house we sold, the new apartment, the money you put into it, the new car, the new phone... What new car? So not the car. Don't you get what I'm saying? I've been telling you for a year now. Right? If you were more careful we wouldn't be... "More careful"? What did being careful ever get me? So I took a risk, so what? You have to take risks to get ahead. Otherwise you achieve nothing. But it isn't fair. We agreed this trip was also to figure out where our relationship is going, right? So give me this time, and no crazy phone calls. Give me time to think, just like we discussed. It has nothing to do with what we discussed. You don't know what's going on. It has nothing to do with that. Doron, get over here. What's going on, huh? You don't want to play basketball? You don't want to play defense? This is the semifinals, son. If we lose, no finals, no overseas trip, nothing. So, what is it? You don't feel like playing? I do, believe me, and how. Substitution. Ofek, come here. Kill 'em, Doron! Kill 'em! Yes! That's how you do it. So, lucky win, huh? Where did you park? - I came with Shmuel. - Why? Why not? I sold the car. Why didn't you take a shower? I prefer taking a shower at home. Avraham! Keep walking. - Keep walking. - Avraham! -What? You playing games with me, Mr. Nawi? - I have to hide here at night like a thief? - I'm playing games, Leviko? - Who asked you to hide? - Avraham, don't "Leviko" me. Who asked me?! You're the one who's been hiding for the last 2 weeks. I call, you don't pick up. What else can I do, huh? Want me to break your door down? - You owe me money. - Doron, go upstairs, I'll be right there. No. Go upstairs, sweetheart. Let me talk to your dad. Excuse me, can I help you? Can I help you? Yes. You can get me my money. 40,000 that Avrahamiko here owes me. "Avrahamiko" will pay you when he can. Now, go away, please. Shmuel, it's okay, we're just talking, relax. Doron, go upstairs. You, go away, don't come here anymore. - Shmuel... - I said go! - Shmuel, don't. - Who you waving your hand at, huh? I'll do whatever I want, you stinkin' Arab. Now go. Who are you calling a stinkin' Arab, you piece of shit? - No! Shmuel! Are you insane? - Go! -Shmuel, stop! -Shmuel, Shmuel... - Shmuel, stop. - Get outta here! - I'm an Arab? - Shmuel... Motherfucker! You're calling me an Arab?! Just you wait, you, you and you. I'll show you what an Arab is. - Go! - I'll bring 10 guys around, with iron pipes and rocks, you asshole. I'll tear you to shreds. I'll tear your eyes out, just you wait, you bastard! I'll tear your eyes out! I'll show you Arab. Just you wait, Avraham, you bastard. I'll get my guys over here, I'll tear out... I'll tear out your eyes, motherfucker. - That's enough. - Just you wait, motherfucker. -Enough. - You too, Avraham, just you wait. - Get outta here already. I knew something was off. Lucky I made a turn. Doron, let me in. Doron... - Doron, answer me. - Is this the...? Yes, thanks. Doron? Doron, I need to get something. - Doron... - Doron, give me a break. Doron, I'll knock the door down. Shmuel, back off, I'm handling this. Fuck. Look, Dad, I have to start shaving, don't I? Yes, you can start. Why didn't you open the door, Doron? This is a great house, you know? The best I ever had. Me too. Will we come back? To this house? Of course. Will Leviko really be back with his friends? I don't know. But for now we have to leave. Come on, let's pack. - Where are we going? - To Shmuel and Orna's. We're not telling Mom? I'll tell her later. Come on, let's go. Give me a second. Okay. Here, this is the treatment table. You can sleep right here. You can sleep on these mattresses too. Get organized then come to eat. - Welcome. Welcome. - Thank you. -Thanks for having us. Come, dinner's on the table. When are you going to tell Mom? After dinner. Let's go. Hello Zruya, Shira, Meshi. How are you? - Fine. -Fine, thank you. - Hello. -Thank God. Did you wash your hands? Shmuel! Did you wash your hands? Come, let's wash our hands. - I washed them at home. - Then wash them again. She's killing me with her religious mumbo-jumbo. Can I have some water? Yes. Enjoy your meal. Hold this. - It's the potatoes dish that you like. - Thank you. - Want some juice? - Excuse me. - It's Mom, we'll talk to her later, okay? - Why? Let's all say hello. Not again. Shmuel, wait. I'm not at your place, they're at ours. Him and Doron, yes. - They're staying over. - Shmuel, stop. Give it to me! What are you doing? Stop worrying. Everything's fine. They're here now. Doron is fine. Wait, I'll give you your husband. Hold on. - Why did you do that? - What did I do? Hold on, Dassy. Excuse me, I'll be right back. - Why is your dad so upset? - Shmuel... He wanted to talk to Mom later, she doesn't know what's going on and... She doesn't know? We talked to her at the game. She doesn't know what's going on at work? - With the workers and all? - Shmuel, that's enough. What? Dassy, we had to leave the apartment. Yes, but this was after the game. Of course. Fine. He'll call you later. Bye. Dad, is she coming? Yes. Come on, Doron, let's unpack our stuff. We're in the living room, join us after you settle in. - Avraham, you barely touched your food. - What? Yes, I'm sorry, I'm not... - I'm not hungry. - What's that? It's lovely. Did you make it? Dad did. I have to show it to the girls. Just be care... Meshi, join us. We decided to put some color, look how nice. Did those colors even exist there? Black and green? Sure. What, no sports on TV? There's tons of sports on TV. We don't watch TV at this hour, this is family time. Here, in the corner. Here? -Yes, yes. You can color the other side. I'm going outside for a bit, okay? Go shoot some hoops, I fixed the board. Am I coloring well? -Excellent. Just make sure it doesn't fall. Okay, I have laundry to fold. Color a bit more then cover it in the paper I gave you. They'll cover it in the paper I gave them, so it doesn't get dirty on the way to school. Thank you. What is this? Doron! Are you insane?! Don't just stand there like some jerk! Can't you see where you're going? - The kid just peed on me, can you believe it? - I'm sorry, I... It always happens when I don't sleep in my room, I get confused. Confused? What do you mean, confused? Doron, sweetie, not again. I'm sorry, I don't know why it happens, I get confused. Change the sheets, I'm taking a shower. Next time tie your leg to the bed and you won't get confused. Especially if you know it's going to happen. He's a sleepwalker. I'm telling you. You should take care of that. It could happen to anyone, Doron, don't worry about it. Do you still have to go to the bathroom? No, not anymore. Then go back to bed. You too, Avraham, that will be best. Come, Doron, let's go to bed. Good night. - Mom, what happened to Doron? - Nothing happened. It's okay, go back to bed. What do you mean, "nothing happened?" Doron just peed on your dad. It'll pass, Doron. Everything will be alright. How? You're just saying that. No I'm not. I'm not just saying that. Doron, enough. You don't want to call Mom? No. Why? It's the middle of the night, I don't want to wake her. Have you totally lost your mind? Are you making fun of me? Of the project? Who do you want to show this to? Yad Vashem? You think they'll accept this? I'm telling you, it wasn't me, it was my cousins. Your cousins?! What cousins? Stop jerking me around. Look at the other projects and tell me, are we all insane or is it just you? Go, Oren, go. Come on. Excellent, excellent. Shai! Get in there! Give him the ball, he is open. Hands, hands! - Take your hands out of your pockets! - Dolberg, come on, let me practice. - What's the project got to do with this? - I'll tell you. You make a laughing stock of the Holocaust and you ask what it's got to do with this? But I didn't. I did my best. Come on, guys, lay up and jump shot at the other side. Dolberg, I don't deserve this, I swear, I didn't know. Give me a break, leave me alone. If this wasn't our most important game, and you weren't so important to this team I would have kicked you off for good. Be a Smartass at home, not here, and if your parents won't discipline you, I will. I don't have a home, okay? My home is here. You have no idea what you're doing, Dolberg. Sit down. You're a piece of shit, Dolberg. A piece of shit! Doron! Doron, get back here! Doron, get back here or you'll regret it for the rest of your life! Doron! Doron... What's the matter? Look, Doron, after behaving like that, - you being my best player, I can't... - It's not... It's not about you, I... I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me. This has nothing to do with you. Then what made you lash out? I've known you for 3 months, I read people pretty well. You're a good kid, what happened? It's okay, I... I'm calm now. Then come with me. I stopped practice, I have something to tell the team. Go tell them, I... I'll be right there. I'm okay now. What do you mean, you don't have a home? Did you sell or rent the apartment? We left, we... we live with my uncle now. We left our home. I told you to sell the apartment. Pay back the mortgage, and the loans and you'll have plenty of money left. A lot of money left. Then we can at least discuss this. Look, I... If you told me it was your parents apartment... I sold it for this one. I put all my money in it, but that's not the issue, Gideon. How can I sell my home? My own home, just like that? It's the first apartment I ever owned. I designed it with the architect, room by room. I didn't build it but I was involved from the get go. I chose everything, I drove the contractor crazy. Listen, that's my home. If I sell it, it'll take me back 20 years. Like I never achieved anything. I can't do it. Talk to them again, let me pay in installments. I can't, Avraham, I'm sorry. Shmuel? - Good, take it slow... - Shmuel? Come in. - I just want the computer. - Take it. A little bit more. Excellent. Lift. Good. - Hey, Doron, how's it going? - Fine. -How did the project go? - I think it was too much for them. - What do you mean? Doron, what are you eating? Just a salami sandwich I found in the fridge. Doron, Get up with that sandwich and glass and leave the house. Now. Take the milk and the sandwich and go. I'm sorry, I didn't notice, I was hungry... Just leave. Now. And don't bring that glass back in. Throw it away. What are you doing out here? Eating. Here, I don't feel like finishing it. Why are you sitting outside? - Orna threw me out. - Why? You gotta pay attention, Doron. We don't want to offend Orna. Want some? No, thanks. She told me to throw it away. Aren't you drinking too much milk? Dolberg said that if we win tomorrow we're going to Munich. Oh yeah? That's great. Go, have fun. - Where's the game? I want to come. - Same place. We'll visit Dachau too, and if we win we'll go to Yad Vashem, to get a feel for the place. That's what Dolberg said. So we don't get a shock. What shock? I've been there 6 times since 5th grade. - He wants us to bring the projects too. - Dassy? Mom! -Hey! What? - That was quick. - Sure. - Were you waiting for me? - Of course. Why didn't you call? I waited all night. - How did it go? - Fine, interesting. I can't. I just can't sleep like this. I can't sleep in my brother's clinic, I just can't. I'd already got night shifts all week. And tomorrow I'll start looking for an apartment. What apartment? To rent. We can't stay here. - Did you do some thinking? - About what? About us. I thought about Doron. And me? I was mad at you. Very mad, for a few days now. Avraham, we have to get out of here as soon as possible. Get out of here? How? I'm broke. We don't have money to go anywhere. It's as bad as it gets, Dassy. My checks are bouncing, people are after me. I told you. Yiftach is ignoring me, the bank wants nothing to do with me. I don't have any money. None. I'm bankrupt. I can't take it anymore. I can't. Stop it, Avraham. Stop. He peed on Shmuel. Excellent. Listen, Avraham, I still make some money. It'll be enough for rent. How about we stay a little longer? We'll wait a bit, then we'll go back. -Here? Home? No way. I'm scared after what you told me. I don't want to go back there. Just sell it and that's it. I'm not selling the apartment, Dassy. It's a great apartment, it's our home. Where are you going? Get some sleep. You have a night shift at the hospital tomorrow. You want to sell, sell. You don't want to sell, don't. All I know is that I can't sleep here and I don't want to live here, that's all. Where's Doron's computer? I think so. In half an hour. Fine, thanks. You don't have school? Or do you start late? We don't have school today. The game's at 4, Dolberg said we should rest. You want to go there? -Yes. You'll come with me, right? Did you sleep well? Barely. But I'm fine now. Did we disturb you? A little. Yiftach. Are you insane? What are you doing coming to my home? What can I do? You're not in your office, you don't answer your phone... I just got back from Bulgaria, okay? What's with you? This is not like you. - Coming to my home? - You paid already, why cancel the check? Because we can't build. What don't you get? The authorities are still inspecting. We can't continue. Enough. I don't like talking here like this. I don't. And you think I like it? But I don't have a choice. Listen, I'll say it like it is. Help me. Please. I can't. I'm sorry. And do me a favor, Avraham, don't ever come to my house again. Dolberg... Are you selling your apartment? I'm renting it out. Doron, what... Are you here to buy? Hello, Ma'am, I assume you're Doron's mom. This is my coach and history teacher. - Nice to meet you. We want to rent. - Come in. - What a surprise, huh, Doron? - Totally. Did you sleep well last night? He slept very well. This is the apartment. It's small, but we were three people. It was just right. Who's this? My father's daughter. My sister. She died before I was born. So... we're looking for an apartment to rent. Funny that you're Doron's teacher. Yes, surprise. I heard that you moved at the beginning of the year. - And now you are staying with your brother? - I told him. Yes, a little setback, but we'll be fine. Those are my parents, over there. - Mom? -What? - Do you have a boyfriend? - What? - Do you have a boyfriend? What are you talking about? I have lots of friends. - Give it to Doron. - Why did you shoot, moron? He's wide open! Wake up, Avraham. Your son's about to lose a championship game. Don't you want him to go overseas? I do, I want him to get away. And when he gets back he'll see you like this? One project, that's all I need. An advance payment is all I need, there's this entrepreneur in Maale Edumim - and another in Bet Shemesh, we're trying... - Yes! Doron, open! Don't pass it, Doron, go all the way. Did you get that? He's looking out for everyone but himself. Dolberg! Dolberg! Take a time out! Time out! You're losing the game! Defense! Don't just stand there! Time out. Get over here. Doron! Play it solo! Don't be scared! Play it solo! Doron listen. Listen everybody. There's still a lot of time. They lead by 8, but we can close it. A few stops and the game is ours. Come on, hands! - Go team! - Go! Don't be afraid, Doron. Just play solo, Doron. Don't be afraid! Close off his left! Go, Doron, go, go, go! Yes! Hands. Hands. Give it to Doron, that's it, Doron! Doron! Doron! Doron! Doron! Doron! Doron! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Romano, substitution Doron, come here. You're a great kid, a great player. Doron Nawi! Doron Nawi! Salim, that's his son. Wasn't he with him at Pisgat Zeev? Doron? Doron! Doron, stop! Stop playing games, Doron! Doron, stop. Doron! Doron, where were you? What is this? I put on my costume. I went to dinner, then I went home. Is he with you? This is Salim. Salim, this is my aunt, Orna. -Hi. - She's religious. - Oh. Come in. Are you looking for Avraham? - Yes. - Doron, where have you been? It's okay, it's Salim, he works with me. I went home to get my passport, I need to bring it to school tomorrow. I was afraid you wouldn't let me go. You shouldn't have gone. We would have taken care of it. What did you dress up for? I wanted to get away from him. Avraham, we have to talk. You can sit in the dining room. Thank you. Come, Shira. - Should I call Dassy? - No, no, what for? Doron, I want to talk to Salim, okay? You can go to our room, but keep it down, Shmuel is sleeping there. You can wake him up, I'll be done in 10 minutes. It's okay, I'll be quiet. I brought your passport too. Why? Why are you hiding like this? I didn't have a choice, I had to. Had to what? Why? It's your home. You're running away from your home? Where will you go? Here? Overseas? "Overseas..." -They'll get you wherever you go, Avraham. With the money you owe, you'll never get away. I tried everything, Salim. I went to the bank, to Yiftach, I called the guy from Bet Shemesh, from Maale Edumim... They don't want to work with me. - That's it. - Avraham... You're a fine contractor. You're a good man too. Me and everyone else knows that. Listen, here's what I was thinking. Come work for me. - For you? - Yes, for me. I have 2 buildings to finish in Ramle and a building in Geula, and maybe another in Har Choma. I could use a Jew by my side. We'll get everyone together, all the people you owe money to and we'll tell them you're broke. I'll take on your projects and your debts and you work for me. They'll work for me too and I'll pay them back, in time. And you'll pay me back. In time. - Not today or tomorrow. - There's no comparison. You can't compare what I owe and how much you can pay me. One step at a time, Avraham. Trust me, people will wait. What's this? Hitler?! Yes, his speech in Munich and another one from... Are you crazy? You're that brainwashed? Who's with your father? Salim. A worker of his? Not exactly. They're working together. Shmuel! Please don't go. Dad asked to talk to him alone. They're friends, don't worry. Salim is looking out for him. - You're afraid I'll throw him out? - Yes. - So you want me to hide in my own home? - Just for 10 minutes, Shmuel, please. 10 minutes and he's gone. I'm sure. 10 minutes. Listen, one job could turn everything around. And there's this building in Maale Edumim... - Stop. -Besides... - Avraham... Stop. Come on. You know that's not how things work, right? Don't do this. Don't fool yourself. Listen, and listen good to what I'm about to say. Only we can help you, your creditors. Just us. - What's going on Salim? - What, Tawfik? I've been waiting outside for 30 minutes and you're sitting here?! I'm not "sitting here" and it's not 30 minutes. Hello, Tawfik, how are you? How's the leg? Cut the crap with the leg! The leg is shit. Wait, Shmuel, wait, it's Tawfik, it's okay, I know him too. He's harmless. - Shmuel, please, Dad will work it out... - Work it out? - They are inside my home! - Dad will work it out! Dad will talk to them, he'll work it out. He'll work it out. Dad will talk... He'll work it out. I'm such a cry baby. Tell me, Shmuel, what do I have to do to improve? Improve? In what? Basketball? Take over the game, don't be afraid. Just like you did. Go to the basket more. What else? You think I don't get you, Doronchik? You think I don't get what a sweet and special boy you are? Let me tell you something. When you get the ball, remember that, it's in the best hands on the court. I'm sorry, Avraham, but I have to ask you to leave. There are children in the house. Please, go. Alright. Come. And what about my children? They don't need food, go to school? Leaving me like this, broke, and with a cast on my leg... - Tawfik... - You have no heart, Avraham. Tawfik, let's go. That's it. Go wash your face, Doronchik. Where is he? -There. You were afraid I'd come in, huh? Yes, a little. Shmuel, thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry. There is a family and kids here. We can't have people coming here and yelling, who knows what else could happen? Orna, they're working on it. Dassy is looking for an apartment, maybe she already found one. Doron, what's with the apartment you saw? You mean Dolberg's? I don't know, ask Dad. Dolberg? Your coach? Ask me what? Did you find an apartment? I need a breath of fresh air, okay? We'll be out of here, I promise. I just need some air. Go to sleep, Doron. You've had a long day. Sit, sit. Are you kidding me? Letting me wait out here? I came as soon as I got your S.M.S. Give me your phone. - Which one? - Your cellphone, give it over. Good, now say goodbye. Why? I need... Be quiet, you dog! Shut up. You don't need anything. What a building. What a roof. You let me wait for 10 minutes. This is what you call "As soon as I got your S.M.S?" Mr. Nawi, there's something you don't understand so I'll explain for the last time. Listen up. I want what you owe me by Friday. By Friday, I have it all. No matter what. I don't care how, where... nothing. You, your wife and your son are in my hand now. Like the devil, I'll come to you when you're sleeping and I'll fuck you all up. If you'd let me wait a minute longer I'd be up at your brother-in-law's. You asshole, you thought I wouldn't find you? You played well today. Thanks. I should come more often. To see you more. Fuck... Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad... Dad! Dad? Dad! Dad, wake up! Dad, Dad! Dad! Avraham, wake up! Dad! Dad! Dad! Wake up! Dad! Let's go. Get up, Dad. Dad, Dad, look at me. Dad! Look at me, please! Mom? Dad killed himself. I mean it. Yes. He took tons of pills. At home. Ours. So call it, and get over here. I'm listening. Mom, come quick. One more glass, Dad, one more. Dad. This is good, Dad. He threw up. Chunks. How should I know if it's everything? Mom, when will you be here? Where's the ambulance? Okay. I don't need an ambulance. You do, Dad. Mom is on her way. Drink some more. Wait. Wait. I need to throw up again. I'm sorry, Doron, I'm sorry. Okay, wait. I'll help you. Careful. Thank you. Anybody home? Hello! Did you call? Hello, Sir. We're the paramedics. How are you doing? - I'm fine now. - We're taking you to the hospital. I don't want to go to the hospital, I'm fine. Let's get you to the hospital, Sir. Your son can come too. Better safe than sorry. Hello. Excuse me, I'm his wife. He doesn't want to go to the hospital. - I don't want any hospital. - How do you feel? I'm fine. Wait a minute, alright? I'm a nurse at Shaarei Zedek hospital. I know you, don't I? Could be, yes. We should take him to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Avraham, let's get you to the hospital. No, I'm not going anywhere. Doron, did he throw up a lot? Tons. Everything, I think. You never know. You can't tell how much he took. - I still think... - We're staying here, thank you. But don't let him sleep. Keep him awake for at least 6-7 hours. -Okay. What did you do, Avraham? Why? Avraham? Go to sleep, Doron. I'll stay with Dad. I don't want to, I won't be able to fall asleep. - I want to be with Dad. - I do too. Go to sleep. I'll stay with Dad. If I get tired, I'll come get you. - Okay. - You haven't slept in 2 nights. What's going on, Avraham? My eyes are closing, can't you see? That's what's going on. Avraham, please, talk to me. Did something happen today? I wanted to die, that's what happened. I want to die. Stop talking nonsense. Listen, Avraham, I was thinking, but not in Romania, here, now, on the way here, on the way home, I was thinking that I don't want you to die. I don't want you to die. And it's not something one can know, because... but I don't want you to die. And I was thinking something else too, that I don't want to stop thinking about you, about you and me and Doron, I don't ever want to stop thinking about you, I don't need 2-3 weeks in Romania, I want to think about you my whole life. Forever. Avraham? I'm not sleeping, I'm just closing my eyes. I want to die. Stop it, Avraham. I'm afraid, Dassy. Of what? Of everything. Doroni? - What? - Where are you going? I can't sleep, I want to get something to drink. Did you think I was going to pee? Why won't you try and get some sleep too? Who will stay with you? Doron. Are you sure? -Go, you haven't slept in 2 days. Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Stephen Curry, an amazing shooter, Klay Thompson, both from Golden State, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay... Dad! Sorry, Doron, I can't keep track of all the names. Can we talk about something else? Thousands died in Buchenwald, their bodies were loaded on carts and they were sent to the crematorium where other prisoners worked. They pilfered the bodies, they yanked their teeth out with their hands, they pulled their hair out, they tore their rings off their fingers... - Doron, stop... - They yanked the earrings off their ears. Doron, please stop. I can tell you're an expert, but it's not... But I can't let you fall asleep. We can talk about something else. You know what? How about taking a shower? Dassy, come to bed. The couch is uncomfortable. It's okay. Doron fell asleep, and I... Doron. Doron. Doron. Come. Come, help me. Here we go. - What are you doing, Dad? - Taking you to bed. Let's go. I fell asleep. It's okay. Avraham, you sonofabitch, what are you doing? You sonofabitch. Fuck this, you're not jumping! I'll come up there and break the door! Fuck. Watch the door! No way you're jumping, you sonofabitch. - Sshhh, Leviko... - No way you're killing yourself. You give me my money first, you sonofabitch! Give me my money before I fuck your entire family. - Sshhh, Leviko... - Fuck "Sshh"... Let go of me! He wants to go and kill himself. Where'd you hide last night, you douche? I buzzed, you didn't answer. Lucky for me you didn't kill yourself last night. Let go of him. Asshole. I tried, it didn't work. What "didn't work"? -I took pills, but I was saved. I was saved and now you. Pills? Pills are no good. They never work. You're better off jumping. That always works. Fuck me and my luck. Great roof you got here. Fresh air. What a view of the city. You go, I'll take care of this. Wait in the car. -Can I take the bike? - Yes, take it. - Forget the bike. What do we do now, Avraham? What do we do? I had a million reasons to commit suicide. A million. I could have jumped, suffocated myself... But I didn't. You know why? Because I deserve better. That's why. Because I know I deserve better in this life. Work and money, they won't break me, because I'm Leviko and I deserve better. That's why. You get what I'm saying? What's this about? Money? Money is nothing. Sell the house, you'll be swimming in money. Better you give than people come and take, believe me. I tried to die twice. Twice. It didn't work. Listen, Leviko, I'll give you a postdated check for... 3 months from now. I'll manage. I don't know about selling the house, I can't deal with that right now, but... I'll manage. Of course you will, Avraham. Avraham, forget about it. What's a house? You and I, we build houses. A house is nothing. We both know that. Nothing. Sand, stones and iron, that's all. Let's go downstairs, I'll make us something to drink. - But let's be quiet, okay? - Okay. Sorry about breaking the door, get it fixed. Great roof you got here. on the beach, all swollen. Dead. Then there was my cousin, too. One day we found her hanging from the light fixture in the living room. Her head like this. Dead. She put a chair on the table, got on the chair, kicked it from under her and that was that. She broke her neck. Then there was my boarding school teacher, Nissim Elbaz. He came from Tunisia. One day the kids were making fun of him, he jumped right in front of a tractor... Leviko, gimme a break, I've had a hard day. Enough is enough. No, my mistake. He jumped in front of a harvester. His dad won the Bible Contest, I saw him on TV. And my brother in law's boss, my brother in law worked at a Volvo garage. One day, no one knows why, his boss was driving 200 km/h on highway 4 and bam! He crashed into the safety barrier. There was nothing left of him. His body was torn apart. I swear, the memories are all coming back. So many people died for nothing. For nothing. And our deputy mayor too. - His daughter got married... - Hold on, Leviko. Do you hear that? - What? - The ball, you hear that? That's my son, I didn't even hear him leave the house. Doron! Why didn't you jump from here? It's a great balcony.
