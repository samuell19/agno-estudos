I like you. Please go out with me. Okay. You fall in love with someone, Confess your feelings to them, And become a couple. Everyone would say that this is a wonderful thing. But that's wrong. (Queen Bee) Worker Bees! Work! Work! Work! (Worker Bee) Understood! Queen Bee-sama! Work! Work! Work! Being in love and being loved has a definite ranking of power balance. Work! Work! Work! (Slave) (King) Falling in love is like your soul being in servitude, and confessing your feelings is like proclaiming that you're awestruck. If you are trying to live a noble life, Then you cannot be defeated by any means. Love is war. The one who falls in love loses. Here is Shuchiin Academy, A prestigious school with an ancient and honorable history That was established to educate the most elite of children. Although the school is no longer focused on nobility, Many students born into prestigious families that hold the country's future in their hands are attending the academy. Of course average people wouldn't be chosen to lead and unify these students. Shuchiin Academy's Student Council Vice-President, Shinomiya Kaguya. Total worth: 200 trillion yen. Her family owns one of the four largest conglomerates in the country, the Shinomiya Group. She's the first born daughter of the head of house, Shinomiya Gannan. A genuine young lady that represents Japan. Traditional performing arts, music, and martial arts. A talented genius with wonderful achievements in various fields. And then, the young man that Shinomiya supports... Shuuchin Academy's Student Council President, Shirogane Miyuki. He is both strong and silent, Yet intelligent and wise. He placed first in the school's practice exams. He was also able to get a top score countrywide as well, while competing with fellow geniuses. In comparison to the talented Kaguya, his devotion towards studying draws both fear and awe. It's because of his admirable conduct that he was chosen for student council president despite being a new student. The weight of the pure golden braided cord has been passed down by each student president for 200 years. Hello. Hello. Hello. Those two are so well-matched! I wonder if they could be dating? I bet they are! It seems that there are some rumors going around. Like we are in a relationship or something. They're at that age. It's best to ignore it. Is that what it is? I have little to do with those types of things. Like there could be a woman suited for me. Why should I have to spend my precious time on a woman? But... If Shinomiya demanded that I go out with her, I suppose I would consider it. Goodness, ignorant children with their common talk. Who do they think I am? I'm a member of the Shinomiya family, the heart of this country. How could they reach the conclusion I would date a commoner? Well... There is the smallest slight chance of a possibility. If he offered his heart, soul and hometown I suppose I could train him to be a man that would suit me. Well I'm certain that she has feelings for me. It's just a matter of time. Well, There aren't any men that don't yearn for me. It's probably just a matter of time. While taking part in these sorts of things... Half a year passed and they became 2nd year students. During that time... Nothing of interest happened! During this uninteresting time, their thoughts have changed... From "I wouldn't mind going out with him/her" To "Maybe I'll have them confess their feelings to me" Right, right! Listen to this! I won a pair of movie tickets, But Pesu is all over me during the weekends. I thought if someone was interested I would give them away~ Jya~n! Shuchiin Academy's Student Council Secretary, Fujiwara Chika. A naturally airheaded young lady who loves her dog Pesu. It's Love Refrain! And it's only until this weekend! I mean... What even is "Love Refrain?" These types of movies are the type of thing only stupid couples go to see, I could never. Shuchiin Academy's Student Council Treasurer, Ishigami Yu. An expert at processing data. He detests youth from the bottom of his heart. Being flirty at the movies is seriously unbelievable. Taking advantage of the dark and holding hands, do that stuff outside! I have a rare day off tomorrow. So, Shinomiya would you- Did you know? Theres a jinx that if a boy and girl go see this movie together, they'll become a couple! What?! Oh, President... Did you...just invite me? To a movie where a man and a woman are said to become a couple if they go together? Are you saying that you want to go see it with me, as a man and a woman? That's just like... Just like...I'm asking her out on a date! It's pretty clear, The only thing I can do is smooth over it. Should we... G..go sell the tickets? Oh... I've never seen you look so flustered before. You're drenched in sweat. How cute. How cute. I can't let that happen! Attack! Attack, Shirogane Miyuki! That's right, I invited you. I'm not bothered by rumors like that, But it seems that you are. What will you do, Shinomiya? Do you want to go see this movie with me? He's daringly making an attack here? After inviting me, he's left me with the choice of whether we see the movie or not. A good play. So what will you do, Shinomiya? I could choose to decline here, But then all of my preparing and arrangements will become meaningless! Part #1 of the Plan 1 week prior I confirmed that the president has a day off. Part #2 of the Plan 3 days prior I fabricated the prize of the movie tickets. Part #3 of the Plan The other day while Fujiwara-san was taking Pesu out for a walk, I slipped the envelope with the fake prize into her mailbox. If I was the one to turn him down after doing all of this, it would be the height of stupidity! And if I turn him down here he may never invite me to another movie or anything else ever again! As a lady that is a no! That kind of choice is a no! Yes, well... As a lady I can't help believing in those types of jinxes. So if we are going to go... At the very least... I would have liked it if you had invited me with more passion. C..cute! Super cute! I've done it. Come then, invite me! Shinomiya-san, If you say needy things like that, he'll want to invite you! That's right! Shinomiya, being needy doesn't suit you! That was close... I almost invited her just now... Good job, Treasurer Ishigami! She's gonna kill me. President, I want to die on my own before I'm murdered, so I'm going home. Okay... But..don't die. I have to walk Pesu so I'll be going home! Then for the tickets...here! I'll give them to Kaguya-san! See ya! Pesu~ Pesu~! Pesu~! Since they were both full of pride, There's no way one will invite the other. Which means the only option is to use one's own ingenuity and skill To force the other to confess their feelings. This story is about these two who put their dignity on the line for a romantic battle of wits! What should I do? What should I do to get the president to invite me to the movie? I got it! President, Shall we play old maid? Old maid? The two of us? Yes. The winner can ask the loser to do anything they want. How does that sound? Anything? I will do anything master wants me to do! Nyan~ nyan~ Nyan nyan! Yes! Come here~ So cute~ But we won't allow indecent things. I think we should limit it to earnest things. Well that would be fine. I accept the challenge. This is a battle Shinomiya started. She probably thinks she has the ability to deceive me. I'll have her show me her skills. So then, I'll pull first since I have one extra card with the old maid. The chances of getting rid of the old maid is low in the first round and it's easy to lose focus. In that case... The old maid should be in a place that's easy to reach in the dominant hand. It was on the opposite side... As expected of Shinomiya. She can play well. In that case... Oh my. You do rather cute things don't you. Putting the old maid in the easiest to reach place might be a cute thing to do. Though if you don't pull it the answer to that question will be a mystery forever. Deceiving someone in this game is persuading them to make a choice. Will she pull this one card out of eight, or won't she. Changing the chances to one of two is also a tactic here. So then, what will you do Shinomiya? True. I know. The president is a very lovely person. How unfortunate. It was the Joker. She laughed! Now then, I'll return the favor. She laughed even though she pulled the Joker! Why?! What is she thinking? Is this a scheme? If it is, what kind of scheme? What's the matter, President? No... The current situation is overwhelming, She can't reverse it from here. That laugh was just a bluff! She's just trying to persuade me... Persuade?! Could it be... For instance, let's say I win this game... Alright. I've won. Now then, I wonder what I should ask for. Even though these were tickets...we specially received from Fujiwara-san... I'll go see the movie by myself. If she said that while crying... I understand, I got it. How about if I ask for us to go to the movie together? I wouldn't be able to help myself. It's a tearful request strategy! This is a game she devised to get me to invite her to the movie. In other words... She's wants to have me win this game. Doing these dull things again. In that case, after deliberately winning this game... The president is acting strange! Could it be that he's realized what I'm aiming for? This is bad! If he realizes that all of this was a plan to get him to invite me to the movies, He'll misunderstand and think that I want to go to the movies with him at all costs! No! This is a plan I prepared for the president because he's too prideful to invite me even though he wants to! That's right, this is me being kind! So quickly make a pair and win! Then plead for me to go to the movie with you! Alright! I've won. He didn't figure it out! So then. I wonder what sort of thing I should ask for. Since you've said we should keep it earnest, indecent things and forcing you to look strange are out of the question, correct? That's true. Tearful Request Tactic in Action Something smart and and manly that shows that you understand the situation would be good. For example... They're gone! That can't be, they were right there! Your plan was full of holes. Could it be... That time... Seems she's finally noticed. I didn't let that moment where you felt shaken be a missed opportunity. I've prevented your tearful request tactic. Now there's no way I'll have to awkwardly ask you to go to the movie with me! With this there's no reason for me to go to the movies with Shinomiya. There's no need but... Is it okay like this? Think about it. Think about it Shirogane Miyuki! Oh! The tickets fell over here. These are the tickets you got from Secretary Fujiwara right? You should take care of them. Ah, that's right. Speaking of which, How about if I ask for one of these tickets? One ticket? Yeah. I'll effectively make use of it. You can use the other one in any way you'd like. If you insist. I suppose I'll do just that. I see... So that's how it's going to be. We might end up bumping into each other tomorrow. There's no way that would happen, right? That kind of coincidence. Right. There's no way. That kind of coincidence. Hayasaka. Tomorrow I'm going to see a movie. A movie? You mean being closed in the same space as commoners and watching the same screen as them?! That kind of movie?! Yes, a movie. You mean purposely going to the place where you have to laugh and cry in the same space as commoners?! Like I said, a movie. Thanks for the meal. Hayasaka. Yes. Make yourself lunch tomorrow and eat it. Since I'm going to the movies. A movie? When did you start being a celeb? He could see a movie normally. I don't remember raising a son like that. Like I said it's just a movie. Why do you think we pay such high tuition for a common person like you to go to a prestigious school? He's a scholarship student. You haven't even paid a single yen and he hasn't done anything suspicious. Kei-chan, you shouldn't talk to your parent like that. You shouldn't. You're already done? If you're not going to eat, say "thanks for the meal" and properly wash your bowl! You're annoying! Complaining about every little thing, are you my mother?! We don't have a choice, since we don't have a mother at home. I want Kei-chan to become a proper adult- Like I said, that part of you is gross! It's the worst being around that old man. You shouldn't talk like that. Even still he has some good points right? He doesn't! Ah~ She won't listen to me again. Hm? Hey... He's crossed this way, he's making his way towards the target. Understood! He's heading to the target as expected. Kaguya-sama, isn't it about time? Yes. Apologies, please use the other options. Our deepest apologies, we'll be conducting maintenance on the elevators. The president is moving forward. Countdown until they reach the meeting point. Ah, President. What a coincidence. Ah, Shinomiya. Such a coincidence. As I expected you've come, Shinomiya. I don't mind if you all withdraw now. Understood! Thanks for your hard work~ To think we'd get here at the same exact time. You sure you weren't waiting to ambush me? I could never, you must be kidding. Hey, wait. You can't enter using that ticket. Is that so? You need to exchange the pre-ordered ticket for the entrance ticket. I see. So you do that here. Next guest please~ Exchange the pre-ordered ticket for the entrance ticket... Why is she stopped over there?! If we don't exchange them together our seats will be separate! Next guest please~ Okay. Hey! Um... Can you please exchange this for an entrance ticket? Okay! Love Refrain, right? Is the one in 10 minutes with subtitles alright? Yes. Now then please select your seat. My...seat? Yes! All of the seats are reserved here. What does she mean...reserved? It's like she completely doesn't understand the ticket system! I knew she was a pampered young lady, but I didn't think it was to this level. Let's think about this for a second. First, this is the goal. Watching this romantic movie while sitting next to the president. Then... We'd sometimes accidentally touch hands... And I would enjoy watching his nervousness. Um, ma'am... But if I fail to choose the correct seat... This is no joke! I absolutely have to pick the seat next to him! This is no good. Is there any way I can naturally tell her what seat I'm choosing? Ah it's Pentan! You're right, it's Pentan! Pentan~ "The 12 Pentans G The Movie: Now Showing" This is it! Excuse me, Yes? I'd like to sit here please. Okay, understood. Shinomiya, Are you still not sure? Have you already chosen your seat? Yeah. Pentan left an impression on me. I picked my seat based on that. It's a little rough but I'm sure she'll understand it. That movie that exceeded expectations for a children's story and became a world phenomenon, "The 12 Pentans G!" I picked seat G12. You will pick G11! You got that, Shinomiya?! Ma'am, if you could please choose your seat. I see, President! I understand. You're talking about that Pentan right? Pentan (pentane) is a colorless alkane that has a smell and takes a volatile liquid form. It's formula is...C5H12! C5 is open. So that means that he chose seat H12! Goodness, that president. Only I would only understand that! I'd like reserve seat H11 please. Hey! Yummy? Coming this spring, the touching story of The 12 Pentans G! Ehh~ So you ended up going to see it together, Love Refrain~ It's not like we went to see it together. Exactly. We just bumped into each other coincidentally. Right? I thought maybe you waited to ambush him or something gross like that. I'll focus on my work before she kills me. Coming! Opening the door now~ Ah! Tsubasa-kun! Excuse me! President Shirogane! Can I ask you for relationship advice? Eh? "Cherry Boy Tsubasa" Yes! When it comes to love I thought someone experienced like you could give me good advice! A..ah. So that's what you mean. Hah? What does he mean experienced?! When did people get that image of me?! So... If this advice exposes me... The president is a virgin! Eh?! A virgin?! Seriously?! "Virgin" Sh..Shinomiya... How cute. I have to get through this. I understand. But we shouldn't do it here. Let's go. Okay. The president is giving advice about love? This is the best way to hear about his views on love! Thank you. Hayasaka. So, what did you want advice about? Actually, there's a girl named Kashiwagi-san in my class. I like her. Oh... Kashiwagi Nagisa, The girl in the same class as Shinomiya? Yes. I'm thinking about telling her how I feel. Telling her how you feel... Well, You would need to prepare for that. Prepare for it? You think so too? You know all about this. Well yeah. I want your advice so I can properly confess my feelings to Kashiwagi-san! I see... By the way, have you had any reactions from her? She gave me chocolate on Valentine's Day. What kind? Was it handmade? No... It was a Chocoball. Three of them. Eh?! Only three?! You think it was obligatory gift chocolate? It obviously was! Obligatory gift chocolate at best! No, she's definitely in love with you! Why?! Why would you think that?! But I don't think Kashiwagi-san feels that way. Since just recently... Hey hey, Eh? "Tsubasa's Madonna Kashiwagi Nagisa" Do you have a girlfriend, Tsubasa-kun? I don't. As we thought he doesn't have one! Right? I definitely thought he didn't have one! That's sad! That happened. That's unfortunate, she's just making fun of him. You're...in your popular phase right now. Eh?! Listen, Women are beings that aren't honest about their feelings, Think of it as behaving the exact opposite of how they feel! The exact opposite? Yeah. In other words, she's making fun of you but she actually likes you! She likes me? I didn't think of it that way. If you suddenly corner a girl against the wall, she'll become nervous. But... Go out with me. The moment you whisper into her ear your feelings of love, her anxiety will change into heart throbbing. I call this technique... Kabedown! I came up with it. Kabe...down? President... It's called kabedon. Unfortunately it's already been done, and it's old at this point. President... Damn, have I been exposed? Genius. Are they both stupid? Ah, Kashiwagi-san. Go! Okay! You're kidding right? He really shouldn't... No way, no way! Kashiwagi-san! Go out with me. He did it... Okay! Seriously?! Kaguya-san?! Kaguya-san! What happened? You've got such weird glasses on! N..no this is something else. Oh! That's right! Listen to this~ Listen, listen! Is it about Pesu again? Yes! Shinomiya-senpai could you sign this please? It's amazing! His chinchin! {\fscx55\fscy58\pos(956.8,50.8)}chinchin = penis OR a begging dog trick Is something wrong? No, I understand! You mean your dog's tricks right? You're talking about the begging dog trick right? I know about those sorts of things too. Then he does things like sitting on command, and other normal ones like putting his paw in your hand. But his chinchin is super weird! How can I explain? It's bent all the way to the left. Eh?! Are you alright?! I'm sorry. I choked on my tea. What is this?! Why do I laugh when I hear the word "chinchin?!" Pesu is sneaky! His chinchin only gets big when there's food, but when there isn't it's tiny! Please...stop already... If she notices that I'm laughing at such a vulgar word I'll bring shame to the Shinomiya family! Kaguya-san... Could it be... Chinchin! Stop! Chinchin! Stop! Fujiwara-san! Can you please stop? Yes! "Name: Chinko" Look, Kaguya-san! Kaguya-san! Chinchin! Chinchin! Chin- Shinomiya? I could hear really loud laughter from outside. Ishigami, what happened? Why are you all wet? Fujiwara-san, You can't do that in front of the guys, okay? You understand right? Yep! I'm a young lady! Of course I couldn't say those types of things in front of boys! At least not from my mouth anyway. Hm? President! President, come here for a sec! Hurry! So... What's another way of saying cablecar? Chinchin train! She's trying to get the president to say chinchin! Hm it did have a weird other name didn't it... This is bad! If the president says that word, I'll definitely end up laughing! If I recall, it's a chin- A tram! In English it seems that's what they call it. Safe! That was close! Then what do you call a blackhead seabream when it's still young?! Chinchi- Babatare! That's what they use in the Kansai region apparently. How do you say "cheers!" in Italian then?! Cin- Salute! It means healthy, but it seems that they say it when making a toast. Then...what else is there... I can't think of anything! I held it down! What is this, starting a quiz battle all of the sudden. Kaguya-san! She loves chinchin! Shinomiya does? No! That's why for Kaguya-san's sake... I wanted President to say "chinchin!" No! That's not true! There's no way I could say that here! What in the world are you thinking?! You pervert! President! President... A fever? Yes. That's why our teacher asked me to bring her printouts. Can I ask you to do it, President? Why me? Since it's your fault that she got a fever! My fault? Because... You yelled "Pervert!" at her! That's because she said strange- That's not true. Eh? The one who tried to get you to say that... Was Fujiwara-senpai. Eh?! Is that true? I don't remember that at all. Well anyway, did you know? When Kaguya-san has a fever... She becomes a total baby! A baby?! Baby I have no choice. I'll go. Woah... So this is where Shinomiya lives. Crap...I'm getting nervous for some reason. Please enter. Seriously? This is an amazing house. This is the Shinomiya family's secondary residence. Secondary residence? Yes. The only people who live here are Kaguya-sama and her servants. What about her parents? Her mother passed away when Kaguya-sama was young. Her father lives at their main home in Kyoto. I see... This is Kaguya-sama's bedroom. Kaguya-sama? There's a guest here for you. A guest? Shinomiya... President?! Eh?! Eh? W..why? Why are you here, President?! Well, um... Are you living here from now on?! No I'm not. There's definitely something different about her. But...I wouldn't say that she's a baby, how can I put it... She's just become an idiot! Now then, I must return to work. Okay. Listen, Absolutely no one will enter this room for another three hours. But you must not do anything inappropriate. I..I won't! Additionally, this room is soundproofed, and Kaguya-sama won't remember any of this. So no matter what you do, no one will know. However... You absolutely can't do anything inappropriate. Like I said, I won't! Well, then. Shinomiya, I bought a bunch of drinks, do you want one? Fireworks?! No, not fireworks. It's useless. Shinomiya isn't in any condition to have a conversation. She seems really weak. Since it's your fault that Kaguya-san got a fever! Hey, Shinomiya. Is it my fault that you have a fever? Let's sleep together. Eh? N..no, Shinomiya that's- Are you shy? How cute. Shinomi- Shinomiya will forget what just happened tomorrow, No one will come into this room, and it's soundproofed! President... This situation is way too convenient! I don't have any confidence that I can control myself! What the hell has happened to me?! Why were you in my bed?! N..no.. I just came to visit you. Why did you crawl into my bed?! You invited me! No way! How could you do that while I was asleep?! Terrible! You pervert! Hah?! Wait a minute, I didn't lay a finger on you! Shut up! Leave right now! Pervert! Love advice? Well I heard you recently got a boyfriend. I thought you might have some helpful advice. Yes! If you're okay with me giving it. So a friend of mine, It seems that she wants to find a good way to make up with a boy she's had a fight with. Your friend does? Summer vacation starts tomorrow, right? That's why she wants to find a way to make peace with him before that, no matter what. My friend, that is. Your friend, right? Love advice? Yeah. So this friend of mine, He had a fight with a girl and wants to make up with her before summer vacation starts. But I'm not the type that normally gets into fights. So I'm not really good with that kind of advice. Of course not. Everyone is completely charmed by you, That's why you don't get into fights. Well, yeah that's how it is. I mean... Have you changed a bit? Eh? Have I? My girlfriend wouldn't stop saying this would look good. I see. Well about the cause of the fight, My friend ended up having a fever, And the boy came to visit her. They're a kind person then. That's right! But while my friend had a weak sense of consciousness, The boy got into bed with her. Eh?! That's wrong and shameless! Well of course nothing happened. It was clear that nothing happened. I see. Then what is she upset about? What, you ask... If the other person didn't do anything, then Shinomiya-san... I mean, then what is your friend angry about? If I were to guess what was in my friend's head... This is just a guess, But maybe she actually wanted something to happen, just a little bit. Eh? I wonder if they're really that not interested in me... You've started saying "I" Eh? No, So that's what they're upset about, right? Your friend. "Eh, that part?" The creatures known as girls get mad at weird things like that. Is that how it is? If the guy didn't do anything to feel guilty about, Then there's no reason for them to apologize. Something to feel guilty about... Shinomiya... I'm sorry. I have something I need to tell you. W-what is it? I said that I didn't lay a finger on you, But the truth is...I did touch you with one finger. Where did you touch me? Your lips. President... I touched lightly with my forefinger... Then it seems like I passed out. But I didn't mean anything weird by it! I was playing around...or how should I put this... President. I'm returning it. Now we're even. So have a fun summer vacation. What... Was that just now... What was that? Could this mean... That I can go for it? Shinomiya. President. Hey hey hey hey HEY HEY!! A super fun summer vacation is waiting for me tomorrow! Everyone! Summer is coming! Summer! Summer! Hahaha summer! Hahaha isn't this enough already? I wanna join them! It's known as the season of love, The sun burning down- Ah isn't this enough already?! She's fallen down! Pesu! Haha she's calling for Pesu! Haha! Someone reprimand me! Girls begin to open their hearts And couples begin to take the next step. "Love Hotel" That kind of summer vacation was beginning, And half a month passed. During that time... Nothing of interest happened! Ahh I failed. I totally failed. I should have invited Shinomiya to do something back then. So have a fun summer vacation. This isn't fun at all! It wasn't supposed to be like this. It wasn't supposed to be like this! How did this happen?! Kaguya-sama. About that, It's because all of your plans are dependent on the president inviting you. Why did you look at my notes without permission? It seems that the president has been free this entire time as well. Eh? How do you know that? He posted it on Twitter. Twitter? That's that thing that Fujiwara-san does, right? I love Pesu! The thing where you post pointless things? Show me! I refuse. Please make your own account and follow him. I don't want to. Why should I have to sneakily check up on the president using Twitter? I see. So then, you're okay with not seeing him during summer break? Hey. Where are you going? Shopping for dinner. Give me a ride. Where are you going? The arcade. An arcade at your age? Isn't that embarrasing? Not at all. Don't just get on! Why not? I can't. I might stop at school, see you. Stingy! No way she'd be here. If only... Summer would end faster. "Shinomiya Kaguya" When did she start using Twitter? Everyone from student council! Would you like to go to the fireworks festival on August 24th? Don don don dayo~ Of course I'll go! Good job, secretary Fujiwara! Huh? Don don don dayo~ Thank you Fujiwara-san! Thank you! Then on the day of the fireworks festival... Gross! Move, and those are my curlers! I'm using them, hey Kei-chan! Stop it! This one? Or maybe this one? Kaguya-sama. If you don't hurry and decide you won't make it in time. Yeah. I guess I came too early. How is it? Isn't this too much? It's okay. It's cute. Is it? Let's get going. Okay! Yes? Ah! You're here! President! Eh? Why are you wearing your uniform? It's so that I always have the awareness of being the student council president. You sure it wasn't cause you just didn't have anything to wear? I was kidding... Hm? Is Kaguya-san not here yet? Yeah... Then we'll go ahead and save a spot. Oh, please do. Alright, Ishigami-kun let's go! Go go! She's late. What's she doing? She's here! My apologies. Kaguya-sama is no longer able to come. Why? It seems that we couldn't get permission from her father. Eh? Her father heard that she went to the movie theater surrounded by common people and it's become a problem. Common people? He said that she musn't be around common people aside from school, And that it wasn't fitting for a young lady of the Shinomiya family. But, Kaguya-sama was truly looking forward to it. Seeing fireworks for the first time with friends and not from a window. She had always wanted to be able to do that. I want to see the fireworks with everyone. Yes? Kaguya-sama, your dinner is ready. I don't need it. I'm watching the fireworks. I can do this at least, right? Understood! Just kidding~ Ready set~ "To Hayasaka, I leave the rest to you. -Kaguya" Ready, set! Please give me a ride! This isn't good. This area is all backed up from traffic. Excuse me, I'll walk from here. Eh? 4,010..your change! I'll definitely see them! Shinomiya-senpai! My first kouhai. The first person to become my friend. The first... Shinomiya, do you have a moment? Person that I'm curious about. I'm the one in that circle. I want to see those beautiful fireworks with the people I like. God, I don't need love this summer. So... At the very least let me be together with them! This year's Tokyo Firework Festival has come to a close. Thank you for enjoying it until the end. Please be safe traveling home. That was great, they were pretty! I wanted to see them... The fireworks... With everyone... If that's the case, Then I'll show them to you. President? Why? How did you know I was here? Are you talking about the game where I read your mind and search for you? It was one hundred times easier than usual. I want to see the fireworks with everyone. Understood. I began gathering information after getting contacted. I headed over to your place after seeing your Twitter. I had planned to bring a chariot to your house. I was able to confirm your tracks once I arrived. Broken flower planters, A hair accessory in the pool. Water tracked from when you left from the window. Tire tracks left from leaving in a hurry. I was able to confirm that you headed towards the meetup location. I was able to retrace your steps. I went over your steps in my head and came to the conclusion that you left the taxi because of traffic. Then when you arrived at the festival, The fireworks had already ended, And I established that you would be crying. Because you're full of pride, You would go to a place away from the crowds of people. I came to the conclusion that this was the place. Amazing... The fireworks festivals around here typically end around 8. But, In Boso they have the fireworks until 9. Let's go. Everyone's waiting. Five more minutes. Please make it in time. Please make it in time. Please make it in time. Everyone did their best to show me these fireworks. But I'm sorry. I couldn't take my eyes off of his face. My heart beat is so loud. I can't even hear the fireworks anymore. The first day of the new semester. Everyone returns to their daily life from before with anticipation. A long summer vacation where nothing in particular happened, Just that one pinch of a memory at the very end. With that in mind this man, Regretted it to the point of death. "Shirogane Miyuki: Famous Saying Compilation" If that's the case, I'll show them to you. "I'll show them to you." by Shirogane Miyuki Are you talking about the game where I read your mind and search for you? "Are you talking about the game where I read your mind and search for you?" by Shirogane Miyuki It was one hundred times easier than usual. "It was one hundred times easier than usual." by Shirogane Miyuki Ahh man! It hurts! It hurts too much! Why did I say such embarrassing things! If I saw Shinomiya now, without a doubt she would... President. The things you said that day, That hurt didn't it? Someone! Someone kill me! It's a new semester! I look forward to working with you again! Yeah. Looking forward to it, Fujiwara. Yes! You too, Shinomiya. She's put off by me... I'm already being seen as a person so painful that she can't even look me in the eye! This is bad. I need to do something. Shinomiya, about the other day... I've definitely done it now. I'm being acknowledged as a painful person she doesn't want to be around. No! Why am I avoiding him?! It's like I'm suddenly overly aware of him! I have to regain Shinomiya's trust. First... I should greet her as usual. I have to talk to him! Naturally and cheerfully, just like I did before summer vacation. Ishigami. There's dust over here too. Oh, okay. Fujiwara-san, Shall we clean too? Yes! Next time. Next time I definitely won't avoid her! Calm down! That's right! I'll feel calm if I close my eyes so I don't have to see his face! You can't run away here! I... I have something I need to tell you. Eh? On the day of the fireworks... I have to tell him. Stop it Shinomiya! To tell him "thank you!" Don't say any more than that! That hurt, didn't it? I knew it! President? A wire puzzle that's gotten complicated, isn't easily solved. Fujiwara-san, Can you please ask the president to verify this? Eh? You want me to give it to him? Treasurer Ishigami, I want the principal to sign this, can you hand it to Shinomiya for me? She's over there though? While this went on, time continued on. They reached the day that the student council would be dissolved. A year... It went fast didn't it? Yeah. I can finally take this off. It's heavy. The sense of freedom is crazy. Eh?! You won't run for student council president again?! As I'd expect you won't run again, right? There's no merit in doing so. Merit, you say? As student council president you are able to get a letter of recommendation from Shuchiin Academy. If you have that you can get into Harvard University or Cambridge University! Since he's already gotten that, there's no merit in him doing it again. Ah! Okay! Then I'll become the president next! Secretary Fujiwara? I'd announce my candidacy for student council president, Then after being elected... I'd choose you all to be student council members! No, no way! The school would be crushed before that happened. Come on Ishigami-kun~ I'll punch you in the face. Sorry. If that's the case, what about you Ishigami? Will you give it a try? You think I can get votes? The girls in my class cry just from looking me in the eye. That's not even funny. Ah! Then what about Kaguya-san? I... That also doesn't have any merit, right? The daughter of the Shinomiya Corporation going out of her way to do the tiring work of being the student council president? That wouldn't make sense. Then... This is really goodbye for us then. I'm getting lonely all of the sudden! With this the activities of the 67th Shuchiin Academy Student Council have come to a close. Let's go. What should we do? Should we have an ending party at a family restaurant? I want to! Let's go! We should! Shinomiya? Hey! Shinomiya! Kaguya-san! Hey! Shinomiya?! Shinomiya are you okay?! Shinomiya?! Hey! Are you okay?! Shinomiya! "Shinomiya Memorial Hospital" Professor Tanuma is on his way. Professor Tanuma! The daughter of the Shinomiya family! We must hurry. Understood! How's Shinomiya? After having a thorough examination, She is currently resting. Is there something wrong with her? We won't know until we hear the results of the exam. Actually, Kaguya-sama's mother suffered from a heart condition. That was the cause of her passing. Tanuma Shozo, age 53. He is known for having god-like hands that are best suited for conducting coronary bypass surgery. Using these hands he has been able to save countless lives. Well yes, um... Nowadays we live in a generation where everyone feels excessive stress. That stress over time becomes the trigger of heart conditions. It also becomes the main reason for those conditions to worsen. That's why I'm always saying this. No more stress. Would it be better if I said it again? No- No more...stress? No More Eiga Dorobo? That's what he's making it sound like. Is this person okay? Actually in order to resolve stress, I believe that dancing is the best solution. Yes yes! I've concluded that this dance is also helpful for rehabilitation. Don't get in my way! Don't pass in front of me when I'm dancing! HEY! Um, no more stress. That's it. That's what it is. What are you laughing at?! Don't laugh! Concentrate! Stress huh. It's hard for everyone to live. No, you have no stress. "Children don't understand their parent's hearts" Well, I'm going to take a bath and drink some beer. Then go to sleep. It's my fault. Because I made her do too much work. Damn old man. Onii? Shinomiya... Gross! Doctor, please check again. It's unfortunate, but no matter how many times we check the result will be the same. That's... That's unbelievable. For that to happen to me... Kaguya-sama... Shinomiya! What's happened? You've all come. You're asking what happened? Was everything okay? Yes. I'm fine. There was nothing wrong with me. Of course Shinomiya-senpai would be okay! Thank goodness! We were so worried! No. This is strange. I can tell. For just a moment Shinomiya glanced away. That's absolutely a human behavioral trait that occurs when someone is telling a lie. Shinomiya, you... Everyone, please listen. Just now I announced my candidacy for student council president. Eh?! Seriously? Yay! If it's Shinomiya-senpai you'll definitely get it! Yeah! Hey... Why all of the sudden? I want to be with everyone for the time we have left. Time...we have left? P..President... Shinomiya... Hey, Shinomiya! Hey! Hey, Shinomiya! Shinomiya! Hey! Open your eyes! Shinomiya! Let's go! Shinomiya... That stress over time becomes the trigger of heart conditions. It also becomes the main reason for those conditions to worsen. Actually... Kaguya-sama's mother suffered from a heart condition. That was the cause of her passing. This is definitely not good. If Shinomiya works too hard in her condition... Then there's only one answer. Shirogane Miyuki... This is a once in a lifetime chance to show your determination! "68th Generation Student Council Election Candidates: Shinomiya Kaguya & Shirogane Miyuki" Even though you were so against it, Why did you announce your candidacy again? It's simple. I won't let you be student council president. If that's the case I'll call off my candidacy, and be vice-president again- It's not just the presidency. You're no longer needed in the student council. I spent this entire year working my hardest beside you, Isn't that a bit excessive? I regret it. Making you the vice president. Is that so? Then that means we're rivals starting today. Yeah. We're rivals. Hello everyone! King of Prince, Shirogane- A battle between the two role models of the school, Shirogane Miyuki and Shinomiya Kaguya. This battle has garnered the most attention in the history of Shuchiin Academy student council elections. Your favor please~ Shirogane Miyuki has chosen Ishigami Yu as his support. Shinomiya Kaguya has chosen Fujiwara Chika. Shirogane Miyuki's tactic is honestly going by foot to aquire votes one by one. By continuing to protect the traditions- I plan to do my best. Gathering the voters, Using the latest technology, And using financial influence, These were the hospitable tactics that Shinomiya Kaguya used to acquire votes. Their battle was almost completely even. They were unable to see the outcome up until the day of the election. But behind the scenes something big was happening. Fujiwara-san?! Yes. For the last few days she has continued to meet with the former president Shirogane in private. That can't be. There's no way that Fujiwara-san would do that- I understand that you don't want to believe it. Watch this. Miyuki-kun! Sorry for the wait! What does this mean?! What exactly are they doing in there? That's... It's difficult to say this... I told you I can't! This is my limit! Miyuki-kun! Move your hips! Hurry up! The two of them?! No way! I believe that the former president Shirogane is making Fujiwara-san his own, and trying to gain information about your campaign. How filthy! I won't forgive him, Shirogane Miyuki! Makes your heart pound doesn't it? Are you guys nervous? I'm excited! So with that, We will begin the 68th Generation Student Council Election. Both candidates please enter. Former President Shirogane... Ishigami? Get a hold of yourself. Please read it properly! H..he handled cost cuts well... W..with everyone's support... So that we can all have a fufilling youth... Youth... I mean Things like youth are really disgusting. What'd he say? Friendship? Love? HAH?! Are you stupid? I seriously don't need anything like that! Listen... You've gotta stop hating on youth! Everyone dies. That is all! Hey! Our school's student council is managed based on donation, And that amount of money is not meant to be used on childish things. As expected of Fujiwara-san. Her grandfather is a former prime minister and her uncle is a current cabinet minister. They both have experience in political reform. We need to elect someone who is able to make use of that properly. That person... Can only be Shinomiya Kaguya! But, Fujiwara-san... My friendship with you ends today. Thank you for your cooperation. So they've taken a step in the lead. Next we will move on to the candidates themselves. Shinomiya Kaguya-san. If you please. Yes. She did that on purpose. Eh? Really? She was able to get everyone's attention, including the teachers. As expected of Shinomiya. Hello everyone. I am Shinomiya Kaguya, a candidate for student council president in this 68th generation election. During this past year I served as vice president to the former president whom I believed in, Shirogane Miyuki. However, I am bright but ignorant to the ways of the world, and was still able to arrive to this point. This man, Shirogane Miyuki Has been meeting with my supporter, Fujiwara Chika-san, in private! Eh? With me?! Meeting in secret? The president? Former president Shirogane has been meeting with Fujiwara-san who served as a betrayer, And tried to gain information about my campaign. He is a despicable man who crossed the line in order to win. Hey wait! Shinomiya, that's not right! Even though I believed in you. Shinomiya! Can you wait a minute? Listen to what I have to say! Oh my, do you intend to make excuses? I have proof. Hayasaka. Understood. It's Fujiwara-san! Miyuki-kun! Sorry for the wait! President! Shirogane-san! What were you doing?! What exactly occurred in there? It was something filthy. Something I can't say with my own mouth. As expected of the president! He went for it! So that's what it was, somehow I'm really shocked! I'm telling you that's not right! Not right? What's wrong about it? We were having secret intensive training in the equipment room. Secret intensive training?! Not filthy intensive training? You're wrong! We were learning Soran Bushi. Can't you tell a better lie? Kaguya-san! That's the truth! I don't believe you. You just called him "Miyuki-kun" didn't you? Well he isn't the president anymore! That's why I called him by his name! Oh, is that so? That's a far-fetched excuse isn't it. Then why were you suddenly doing Soran Bushi now? See? They can't answer, can they? No more stress... I saw it on TV. To relieve stress, dancing helps. Stress isn't good for people with heart conditions. That's why I thought of dancing to Soran Bushi with you everyday once my campaign activities were over. That's right! That's why we did secret intense training for the president, since he's really bad at dancing! Here we go~ One, two- Yes, yes! That's wrong Miyuki-kun! More! You have to move your hips more! Move your hips more! I'm at my limit! I took part! Ishigami! You're kidding. That has to be a lie! I'm telling you we're not lying! Ahh! Come on Miyuki-kun! Let's do what we practiced! Now?! Now! Wait! Music, start! Now?! I can't! Cut me a break, President! I understand! That's enough! I...without a doubt... I'm really sorry! If you understand then it's fine. Continue your speech. Before I joined the student council... I lived without believing in anyone. I didn't think there was a single good person in this world. That's why I tried to reveal the ugly side of the president who everyone thinks is perfect. Eh?! Officer! Yes, hello! This is serious! What's happened? Just a moment- There was a large amount of money that had fallen in the road! A large amount of money? Hah? This is it. Please look! I brought it here. What's wrong? But no matter how I tried I couldn't find anything. After that I ran out of patience and realized that there are people like him in this world. "Student Volunteer Shirogane Miyuki" That people living without corruption exist as well. That's why I am grateful for the president, truly. Shinomiya... If you compare me to him, I'm a shameful person! There is no other person suited to be Shuchiin Academy's student council president other than Shirogane Miyuki! Oh? Why is she supporting her rival? It's fine, shut up and listen. Kaguya-sama... That's enough, stop! You, shameful? What kind of half-asleep talk is that? You don't understand your good qualities at all! Shinomiya Kaguya... You are always noble and beautiful. That aside, you are also an exceedingly kind-hearted person. I know that. Pidgeons don't flock to me. President... Compared to you, I'm nothing. It would be unbelievable for anyone other than Shinomiya Kaguya to be the student council president of Shuchiin Academy! Eh? What are they trying to show us? I told you to shut up, asshole! Okay. But Shinomiya, I want you to live. I want you to continue living! Eh? In that body you can't handle being in the student council at all, let alone the president! You'll die! I don't want you to push yourself any further! That's why...I said that I have to become the president! You're wrong... The reason I collapsed- It's lovesickness. Love? Yes. I've been a doctor for over thirty years, This is the first time I can relate. After student council ended, And thinking that you no longer will be together with the person you like, I'm sure your heart began to hurt because of this. Then how will this pain in my heart heal? It's easy. If you are able to be together with them again, it will get beter. Together again? What's wrong, Shinomiya? T..the reason I collapsed... L.. If she keeps going like this she can do it! Li...! Li...? Do your best. Do your best! Li...! It's because I like you! I collapsed because I like you! She told him! Good job, Kaguya-sama! That's why... When I thought we couldn't be together anymore, my chest began to hurt... I couldn't bear it! That's why I announced my candidacy! Because I love you! If you say things like that, then I'll say it too! I like you! I like you! I like you so much I can't stand it! No, I like you! I love you! No, of course I like you, I love you! I like you! I like you! I love you! I like you! I like you! I love you! Te amo! (Spanish) Je'taime! (French) Wo ai ni! (Chinese) Saranghae! (Korean) Ich liebe dich! (German) Ti adoro! (Italian) Obicham te! (Bulgarian) Ndagukunda! (Kinyarwanda) I like it! {\fscx51\fscy60\pos(945.6,52.4)}T/N: They didn't specifically say what they liked so it was insinuated that they were talking about each other...but yeah they weren't lol. Same here. I like it... The student council! The student council. With that the election speeches have come to a close! "Shirogane Miyuki 301 votes, Shinomiya Kaguya 299 votes. Shirogane Miyuki wins with a 2 point lead." That was close... You're Shirogane Miyuki-kun, right? You're that famous- Yeah. I'm the person in charge of the narration for this story. Stop? What are you saying? What are you saying right now? Stop it, that- I'm the internationally renowned god-hand, Tanuma Shozo. I'm the Shinomiya family doctor. Yes! I saw you on Jounetsu Taikoku! I have something I must tell you. If it goes on like this, the young lady will collapse again. Eh?! Hey, what do you mean?! Come back here! Stop singing like that! Stop it! Are you listening? He keeps singing... Sorry for calling you over here. Not at all. President, congratulations on being elected. It was a close one. I was told by the principal. That it was the most outrageous election in Shuchiin Academy history. Well, this really is goodbye for us isn't it. Thank you for your support up until now. I'm sorry but...I won't say goodbye. Eh? Shinomiya, Be the vice president again. But you didn't appoint me- You need to be here. You'll collapse again, right? Stay by my side. I want you to be here. President... Is that not okay? No, I'd be happy to. What? Why is he gazing at me so much? Could it be... This development... I can do it! I feel like I can do it now! That's right, During these moments, softly close your eyes! Here we go! The welcome sign of a kiss! Right now! Go! You can do it, Shirogane Miyuki! I'm the most calm here as expected! We're back again! Oh? Were the two of you about to do something just now? It can't be! You're wrong. You're wrong! There's no way we could do something like that in the student council room. Another fight as usual then? I'm the close friends police! I'll arrest kids who fight! Oh! Get along, get along! Eh?! President. You're quite the actor aren't you? You thought I wouldn't notice? In that one moment while Fujiwara-san pushed us... Get along, get along! Taking advantage of that momentum and leaning down to reach my lips. So you wanted to kiss me that badly? How cute. Shinomiya. So you thought I wouldn't notice? In that moment where I was falling towards you, You stood on your toes so that my lips would reach yours. So you wanted to kiss me that badly. How cute. If you are trying to live a noble life, Then you cannot be defeated by any means. Love is war. The one who falls in love loses! ...
