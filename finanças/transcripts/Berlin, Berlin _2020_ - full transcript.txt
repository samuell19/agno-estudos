NETFLIX PRESENTS When I was 18, I had a horrible haircut and a great plan. I wanted to draw comics. I wanted to be in love and really plunge into life. It worked out bloody well. I fell in love with my cousin Sven. People react differently in extreme situations than they normally would. In extreme situations, they react extreme. In plain English, something can always come up. Sometimes a single kiss helps to get over a stupid love story. But I never knew which kiss it should be. Where is he? - In the wardrobe. - In the wardrobe?! Sven's kisses are great kisses. And I also have my great friend Hart. Morning, Lolle. Guess what this is. A letter? Hart is basically the best person in the world. You're cute. Cute? I wish I hadn't said "basically." Then I wouldn't have emigrated with Sven, a stupid idea! - Sven? - Lolle? That was an adventure. Or rather a disaster. But now everything is different. In my mid 30s, I finally have a plan B. The baby plan. I'm about to say "I do." As a wife and mother, I'm about to be the head of a hip Berlin animation studio. Or sell to Hollywood. Sit down, defendant. Fine, I imagined the best day of my life would be nicer. But you shouldn't believe everything you read in wedding magazines. Done? Let's see... what you're accused of, Miss... Holzmann. Yes. Explain your version of what happened. People react differently in extreme situations than they normally would. They react extreme in extreme situations. Everything that happens in an extreme situation should be regarded as having never happened. Because it's extreme and never would've happened if there hadn't been the extreme situation. Which extreme situation was it about? My wedding. Do you know the feeling when everything's perfect? Like in the best Instagram story. And it somehow is... I don't know. Wilt thou love him, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health until death do you part? Say, "I do." Miss Holzmann? Sven? I just wanted to say the same. - You never reacted to our invitation. - I should have, Hart. - I'm glad to see you. - Don't hug me. Shit, are you sick? - No, I have to say something to Lolle. - Shut up! Although the two of us often failed, we belong together. I finally realized after we had sex last month. You had what? Yes, Lolle and I met on a beach in LA by pure chance. I thought you were in meetings all day long, for our company. I was... Tell me that there's a hidden camera. I'd love to. - But there isn't one? - Believe me, I'd love to place one... Lolle. Lolle, I love you. Marry me. Marry me here and now. So, how did you decide? For my feeling. Come on, drive! All these traffic offenses took place because you can't decide on a man? - I convict you. - No. Please, you mustn't convict me. This week we're presenting our new concept to a Hollywood studio, and if they like it, they'll buy our company and all the jobs will be secured. But I have to urgently design one character for that. Do you know what I do not? You don't care? Exactly. I sentence you to 40 hours of community service. You'll start tomorrow morning. - Or would you prefer 50? - No, I think 40 is enough. - Hart! - Leave me alone! Hart, please wait. I'm so incredibly sorry. You have no right to cry. I don't. You can stay in the flat. I'll go to a hotel. No! Hart... - Hart! - Get lost. - It's better this way. Trust me. - Better? She always would have thought of me. I know it. And so do you. You know nothing. You hadn't been in Berlin in 1,000 years. You travel from one beach to the next like a teenager after his A levels. You have no idea what a great life Lolle and I have built up. Our common flat and company. Our common future. Yes, but she loves me, Hart. I'm sorry. I'm such a shitty idiot. No. No, Lolle. Wait, Hart! Do you remember what I said after our night in LA? That you drank too much? That I need something else in my life. Not a man who just lives his life, doing casual jobs in beach bars. That's a good life. - No compulsion. No pressure. - But I want something else. What do you want? - A family. - You want children? You aren't pregnant, Lolle. You aren't pregnant. I'm not pregnant. Hart is a wonderful father. And although Sarah and him are divorced, he takes care of his child every day. Your son, on the other hand, turned 18 without your help. Wait, Lolle. - Lolle? - Yes? What is it? I can't live without you. So I'll start again at zero. At the age of 38. Congratulations, Lolle. And good luck with the rest of your life, Miss "still" Holzmann. Only sleeping tea will help. I need to pee. Shitty sleeping tea. I could try to numb myself with work. It's said that modern women do that. Well, maybe not at three a.m. Could I please have superpowers now? So that I have the power to always make the right decision. Like Miracle Bunny. I knew that you'd come. - Hart. - Shit. Does it hurt? Everything hurts. I think I know why you fell for him again. It was just too much stress for you. For both of us. Eighty employees who want their wages. The Hollywood presentation. The gigantic wedding. Always having sex exactly when you're fertile. What do you think about a small wedding? In some village in Tuscany? We'll pick some people off the street as our witnesses to the marriage. - Lolle? - Yes? Do you want to fly to Tuscany with me? The community service in school will start tomorrow. Yes, but afterwards. The Americans will come. Yes, but afterwards. All right, after that... If you have to work in a school as an adult, you know that you really messed up in life. Hello? I was supposed to see the headmaster. - I'm here. - Where? Here. I should have flown to Tuscany. My name is Carlotta Holzmann. I'm supposed to come here for community service. - How many hours? - Forty. Over eight weeks. I still have 31,433. - Hours of community service? - Until my pension. Thirty-one thousand, four hundred and thirty-three goddamned hours. How old are you? Thirty-seven. I see. Before I became a teacher, women regarded me as hot. They called me "Gosling." - Ryan Gosling. - I see. I know him. - Do you know what I keep asking myself? - No. How many fingers would one have to put into this fan for disability insurance? Don't! Don't you just want to tell me what to do? No. Dana will do that. She has community service as well. No! - Yes. And once again! - No. - She's dipping a student in the toilet. - Yes. So, what did we learn? I'll delete the naked pictures of Lilly. - And what else? - I think I'll take three fingers. I'll make sure that everyone in my WhatsApp group deletes them as well. And? If I do it again, I'll learn to swim in the toilet. Exactly. Now apologize. Sorry. Who said that nobody learns anything in school? Get lost! - No need to be scared anymore, Lilly. - Thanks. Hi, I'm Lolle. You obviously weren't told to dress differently. - No, why should I? - We're here to work. Well, I can't really handle tools. I have something for you that everyone can use. Take it. - What shall I do with it? - I'll take care of the sinks. You'll take care of the clogged toilets. Sure. - Dana? - Yes? I have an important presentation to finish. How about I give you 100 euros and you clean the toilets for me? A hundred euros? Three hundred. - Yes? - You know what? I think some dirty work is good for you. I'm stuffed in debts, but I prefer honest stealing. Okay, I botched it. But this isn't how I imagined it. What I did with Sven in LA wasn't okay. I should've been more honest with Hart. And I shouldn't have driven through the red lights. But besides that... No! Hey! Stop! Get out of the way! Let me through! Damn, is this necessary? Dear God, sorry. Stop! Careful! Shit. Shit. - Shah-Rukh? - Yes. - You have to track my tablet. - I can do that, no problem. - Thank God. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow? - I already called it a day. - You called it a day? You're our system administrator. You have to be ready 24/7. No, according to my contract I work eight hours per day. More work means more money. Do you seriously want to talk about a raise with me now? - Forget it. - Have a nice evening, then. Fine, you'll get one. - Three hundred. - Three hundred what? Rupees? - Four hundred. - Why 400 now? - "Rupees" was racist. - I'm not a racist. And I want 500 now. Otherwise I'll tell everyone you're clich√©-ridden. - Fine, but hurry, okay? - Okay. Not having employees was nice. That was quick. - Yes? - Go straight on and to the right. Okay. Now you have to enter the club. If you had told me that it was this far, I would have taken a taxi. Lolle, let me have some fun. What? The last time I was in a club was ten years ago. And the boys still dance as shitty as back then. - Hey, Dana. - Hey. You have my bag. If it's only about the bag... There you go. No! - Where's the tablet? - It's not a submarine. - What do you mean? - It won't resurface. - Listen to me! - Stop waving your finger about. You can't tell me anything, do you get that? I warned you. You don't want my money, but you steal my tablet? I just didn't want to do your dirty work. I had debts to pay. A vital presentation is on it. No presentation in the world is vital. - That one is! - You businesspeople always cause stress. Career and money. And in the evening you return to your gentrified loft and drink a vino to your sad life. First of all, I don't have a gentrified loft. And second of all, my life isn't sad. - Is that why you have stress wrinkles? - What stress wrinkles? The ones up there aren't from laughing. Maybe it's the menopause. Menopause? I'm not in menopause yet. - Tick-tock. - What? Your biological clock is definitely ticking. And you... I... - You... - I... - Wait, I'll come up with something. - Sure? You're a stupid, shitty cow. That was rough. That was really rough. Shit, everything I've been working for the last years... Could you make me a gin tonic? Shit. Oh, no. - Hart. - Lolle. I found a priest for us in Tuscany and... Lolle? Where are you? You don't want to know. Are you with Sven? No, I'm really not. Thanks. Listen, Lolle. I really tried to understand you, but I have my pride. I want to marry you and have children with you. I want that, too. If you don't fly to Italy with me after the presentation... - everything's over. - Hart, please wait. Please. Hart... I'm calling the police. How about we have a drink first? I'll get you your tablet then. Make me another one. I could really do with one. Thanks. Cheers. Whatever. No good story ever started with a salad. - Hello. - Quiet! Don't be so loud! You're under arrest for car theft. Please leave the vehicle. Listen, this is... This is one big misunderstanding. That's what they all say. And the next thing you'll say will be "ouch." "Ouch"? - Ouch! - Yes, ouch. I'll report you for police brutality and abuse. And for bad breath that could be sold as poisonous gas. If you keep fighting back, you'll get more ouches. - And then you'll go to prison. - Hey. - Isn't there another way to solve this? - Who are you? Someone who could suck your dick. And I should let your girlfriend go for that? - The two of us could do it together. - Excuse me? The businesswoman is old, but not in menopause. - Wait for... - At least she claims that. - So the three of us... - No, we won't. Yes, or couldn't you handle that? - Of course I could. - Ouch! - Go for it. - No. That's Miracle Bunny! Yes, it's my favorite show. I know it's for children, but there's a lot for adults, too. It's really clever. I invented it. - No! - Yes! - That's incredible! - Yes. If you want, I could show you our studio. - You'd do that? - Sure. - Great! - Yes. So you can free us now. Why? Because I created Miracle Bunny and you love her. To be honest... that makes me even hornier. - Let's get it over with. - No, please don't, Dana. - Trust me, I can do this. - I won't watch. First I'll grab it. Then I'll twist it. Then I'll pull it. Yes, have fun at the urologist's. - Shit. - Come. - Ouch. - You rats! I'll get you! Come! - Come! - I think I'm hallucinating. - Ouch! - Don't run there. Where are you running? Slow down, I'm not that fast. The quarter-end accounts have to get done today. Lolle isn't at home. I'll call you back. Are you stalking Lolle now? - I'm worried. - Your worrying is a criminal offense. - She isn't picking up her phone. - Only when you call her. Shit. And when I call her. Okay, I'm sure nothing's happened. - Careful, limb! - Ouch! Which part of "careful, limb" didn't you understand? - Shit, can you still hear him? - No. I think we got rid of him. I can't keep going. Raise your hand. We have to tell the policeman that this is a misunderstanding. What exactly? We didn't steal the car. What? Some would say... Oh, my God! He surely doesn't exist. And you drove drunk. - You could have killed us. - Trust me, I'll die alone. Now we're in the middle of nowhere. Where the hell are we? What? - I think... - You think? We're in the forest. - How about a thank you? - Thank you? You're the reason I am in this shit situation. I could have left you alone with the cop. - Thanks. - There we go. What's up again? Shah-Rukh, you have to track Lolle's cell phone for me. I have to? What you're demanding is a criminal act. And crimes cost more. I'm looking for Lolle and you want to talk about money? Exactly. Five hundred. Five hundred what? Rup... Think about your next words. Just track the cell phone. Don't you get it? I moved to Berlin 20 years ago because I was sick of trees, forests, and anything green. Calm down. It's nature. It's good for you. Hart is surely worried. - Who? - Hart. What kind of name is "Hart"? Hart. Hart. Hart. Nobody will find her corpse here. Yes, Shah-Rukh? I could load a tracking software onto your cell phone. You could call Lolle and immediately know where she is. - Okay, thanks. - No problem, but one more thing. - What? - The 500 is per week. - You'd earn more than me. - I already do. - What? - Tracking software? Yes or no? That's blackmail. Yes. - Fine. - Okay. God, it was nice without employees. What is it now? I lost my cell phone. Sometimes you lose. You aren't helping. I can't help anybody. Do you have problems with someone? That's none of your business. If you drove away with the car because of a man, I can understand. - I've also done that. - Could you shut up? Or do you want to attract evil animals? I'm sure it's just a deer. - Do you have a phone? - Yes. Thanks, it's mine now. - And it's dead. - Yes. Give me that. It's dead. I don't have a phone and yours is dead. We go together well. No, you don't have to help me. Easy going. I've climbed so many mountains. Dear God, one more or less doesn't matter. "Schnitznitz"? "Harz"? It surely isn't Paris. Eastern Westharz? Where the hell is Eastern Westharz? I don't even know where Western Eastharz is. I guess it's west of Eastern Eastharz. - Doesn't matter. - It's the back of beyond. - I'll drive to¬†Lolle. - I'll come along. - Is this your car? - Yes, it's a company car. Charged. - I'm driving CO2-free now. - Great. - Is that a problem for you? - Not for me. Environmentalism is great, but I don't know whether we'll get to the back of beyond with this. I'll puke. Maybe there's a phone here. We'll call for help and get back to Berlin. I won't drive back to Berlin. Why not? - That's none of your business. - Listen up! Take me to Berlin, to my tablet. My fianc√© and I worked hard for months. Without days off. Sometimes we only slept four hours a night. It's no surprise that you don't smile thinking about that guy. Without my presentation, our animation company won't be taken over by the Americans. You want to sell your soul to a major corporation? It wasn't my life goal, either. And what was? To become a princess? - To draw comics. - Do that and stop annoying me. - You know nothing about my life. - Maybe more than you. The way I see it, you should be glad that I took your tablet. So you admit that you stole it? And sold it. To whom? Wait, I think her name was Dr... none of your business. You'll come along to Berlin and take me to my tablet. - I won't. - You will. You're done for. You'll blink first. - Do you really want a staring contest? - I sure do. Okay, pussycat. I didn't outdrink you and don't yet know where you hid my tablet... but you're done for. There's a simple trick to winning every staring contest. Well, almost. Are you mad? I've won. No wonder you have problems with men. Any guy would run away from you. Phone. - It's there. - But with you they line up? - They're calling you by landline. - Very funny. When was the last time you were called? Now I know. Your boyfriend left you. It could have been a girlfriend. Your girlfriend left you? I'm not a lesbian. So it was your boyfriend? Maybe I'm polyamorous. You're irritating. You should handle your own love life. Then you can have children. How would you know whether I want children? Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Where is that phone? I think it's over there. Here? You've been hanging here for a while, right? There it is. No. Okay. 01... No, 05... 05... Shit. Since I've got a cell phone I can't remember any numbers. They cook crystal meth here. Crystal meth? Shit, he's dead. I shouldn't have run away from the altar. - Into the wardrobe. - What? - Into the wardrobe. - Seriously? - Do you have a better idea? - Wardrobe it is. Ouch! We can't ride any further. Great software. It has to be around here. I'll go to her alone. Are you mad? I'm not your chauffeur. - I'll come along. - I don't want to see you now. Wait a sec! You had sex with my fianc√©e! - Stop pushing me. - I'll push you as much as I want to. Damn, do you know why I didn't answer? Because Lolle left me. Then she went back to Berlin. Do you know how I felt? I hit rock bottom for years. One talks to his best friend during a crisis. My best friend took the woman that I love. A real best friend wouldn't do that behind my back. Stop pushing me! I'll push you as much as I want. Prepare the acid. Get the guy. And don't get a hernia. I can't pay four weeks of rehab again. I told you, you can't win a trade war. While we're at it, Mungo still is in the trunk. Let's go and get him. I know he's still alive, that's no reason not to put him into the acid. Gesundheit. - Shit. - Was that one of you? - Buy me some time. - Time? How? Hello! What are you doing in my wardrobe? You know, that question can hardly be answered with yes or no. It was an interrogative question. You used to be a German teacher? Not German, but civics and military education. It hasn't been taught since 1989. Capitalism means learning all your life. True. That's enough to turn someone against globalization. Speaking of globalization, I think it's time to tell you that I've had impulse control problems since the fall of the Wall. I get mad when I'm being bullshitted! I can understand that. And I tend to go violent. That's not nice. And it's bad for the heart. Let's get out of here! An old tunnel. Come on, hurry up! Give me your hand so we don't lose each other. - That's my nose. - I see. Now you have my ear. Those are my tits. - "Tits" is a sexist word. - Tits! Okay, shall we go to the left or right? - Tits. - They went that way! - It doesn't matter. Come. - Shit! Let's fight, comrades! Kill those women! Let me say this much: Holy shit! Shit! Get down! Get to the water before they get back up. - Come on! - I can't swim. Really? Do you think I'm talking nonsense now? Come and hold on to me. Come. Come! Dana! Dana? Dana? Dana! Shit. Dana. Shit. Dana... Hang in there, Dana. We'll make it. Dude, you hit me on the nose. You hit my lip. - Fighting is exhausting. - Yes. Lolle. Wait. Shit. The bear is ringing. It... Did it eat Lolle? You watch too many bad movies. Lolle lost her cell phone, then the bear ate it. It doesn't look thrilled. Run! Oh, God! Damn! Keep running! Shit! Sleep my bear, sleep. - What are you doing? - Sing along. Your mother is a sheep... That's incorrect. A bear's mother can't be a sheep. Stop being a smartass and sing along. Sleep my bear, sleep. Your mother is a sheep. Your father is a camel. But is that the bear's fault? Sleep my bear, sleep. - We're a good team, right? - That's what it looks like. Yes. Shit! What happened? I hung up the clothes to dry. Some guys left the towels here. Why didn't your parents teach you to swim? They had other things to do. Really? What? I see. That's none of my business. You're all right for an old woman with stress wrinkles. Thanks, you too. For a young woman with a pimply butt. That way. I know why I live in the city. Shit. - Go on. - Sure. Yes. Fuck, my knee. I think I have arthrosis. Come on! Hello, Lolle. Lolle? You have a really bad reception. Lolle? Hello? Is Hart with you? My knee. - How is the bear doing? - It's on the phone. What? Something bad again? It depends on your attitude towards nudism. No, my clothes. That's not funny! Shit. Damn. I have to tell you something. Akay. What about him? He's the love of my life. Do you want to be my wife? We even wanted children. Four. "Wanted"? One Sunday afternoon, he left with his motorbike to get cigarettes. He lost control. He died? No, although that probably would have been better. Paraplegic. From the neck down. And he always told me that... that he can't stand it. And I can't, either. Do you understand? That's why I sometimes take drugs. I do understand. You understand nothing. You want to marry one guy and smile when you talk about the other. If you stand between two guys, you love neither of them. Trust me. Neither. I'm too stupid for love. Forced marriages should be implemented again for people like me. At least you don't have to decide then. Dana. Wait. - Who's with Akay now? - I should be. So you'll come along to Berlin again? They have our clothes. We probably broke the bathing rules or something. What are they doing? They're scaring me. That song could be sold as a birth control pill. I know that smell. It's... Lolle! Harald. Lolle, it's so nice to see you. - Who is this? - Part of the answer would unsettle you. I'm not crazy. - I'm a stable personality. - Sure. And I'm an underpants model. You're done for. You'll pay for that. I'll kill you! We'll meet again. - Lolle is a bitch. - Harald! Harald! I'm a different person than I used to be. A person would be fine. After all those years, I found a wonderful community that has healed my soul. No matter what kind of nudist cult this is, since they managed to take a psychopath like Harald off the streets, they deserve the Order of Merit. I'm glad that you've been healed in this wonderful community. But we need our clothes and a cell phone. We live without cell phones. You call that living? We also practice free love. That would be good for you. It would solve your guy problem. - You have two guys again? - So what? That could happen to anyone. No, it couldn't. - It couldn't? - It couldn't. I see that we have newcomers. This is Helene. Our spiritual healer. Come along. To our healing tepee. To the ceremony. - Yes. - Come. Close your eyes. Let your breath wake up Yoni and Lingam. Take the hands of your partner and place them on your belly. I won't do that. Put your hand on my belly and shut up. Feel Lingam growing. Feel Yoni opening and gifting us her smell. Why didn't you just let me die? Just moan like the others. Trust me. I'm almost who I used to be again. Breathe in the smell of the incense sticks. Now show me how erotic you can be. Oh, yes... Ouch. Is it sadomasochism again? - They interrupted our coitus. Follow them! - For our coitus! - They look as if they sacrifice humans. - Follow and catch them! - More hallucinations. - Come! - I have a plan. - Really? Take this. - Our tepee! Save our tepee! - Come! Extinguish the fire! It's burning! No. Oh, no... They destroyed it. Sven, you're living the life of a 20-year-old in the body of a 50-year-old. That's a midlife crisis. If you don't work on your approach towards life, you'll never be happy. - You only say that because you want Lolle. - Yes. That too. But mainly because you're my friend. Were. - I have to rejuvenate my body. - You have worse problems. Lolle. Yes, that as well, but did you even listen? There's Lolle. Fuck. - Help me! - Come. Rejuvenate your body and go. Go on. Hello? Hello. Nobody here. Great. Let me tell you, this morning you couldn't have run this fast. Extreme situations free a bunch of energy. Let's rest a little, then we'll go to Akay in Berlin. Are you hard of hearing? Let me help you. You don't want to help me. I mixed drugs into your drink. That's why you have those hallucinations. You did what? Yes, you were that way because you were high. And that's the only reason I took you with me. But... You're ruining my life! Be glad that you have a life. That's right, just leave. Get lost. Lolle! Lolle. - Naked? - Half-naked. - What are you doing here? Naked? - Half-naked. - We finally want a decision. - Yes. Fine. You deserve that. So, how do you decide? I didn't want more chaos in my life. But part of me still is like I used to be. I realized that today. Lolle, listen. We won't keep pressuring ourselves with having children. We'll sell the company and travel around the world. - What? - What? Yes, I can't stand this madness anymore. Today finished me off. But a part of me isn't the girl I used to be anymore. I want to finally grow up. Lolle, I want to settle down. We could adopt children and be a family. - What? - What? I don't want the stress anymore. Today finished me off as well. - All right. - So? So? I'm sorry, I need more time. Damn. Welcome to the festival of dead-ends. Welcome to Lolle Holzmann. For every person, there is that one right way to become happy. But with me the signage is shit. Crying doesn't improve anything. Come along! He always said that he wanted to die. And I gave in. I didn't want him to keep suffering. So I mixed him a cocktail of pills. Then I waited. He closed his eyes... and fell into a coma. He wasn't dead? It's my fault. - It's not your fault. - It is, I didn't finish it. I promised him to do it. I didn't even dare to go to the hospital. Because you love him. Shall I come with you to see him? I'd love to. Let's get your tablet first. If you want your tablet back, you have to go to Rose. What is that? A bar? No, a woman whom you don't want to know. She owns a club and sells drugs for stolen goods. I got into debt with her when I got the pills for Akay. Do you think she'll just give me my tablet back? If she realizes that you need it, you'll have to pay at least 10,000 euros in cash. I can't get that much this quickly. Well, in that case, she won't give it to you. In that case, we only have one chance. We'll break in. So that's the wild side? How? First we have to open the door. Then we'll get into the stairwell. How the hell did we get up here? With the ladder. God, no. I'm afraid of heights. I thought Akay proposed to you on top of a castle. I wasn't scared in his arms. I'll do it on my own, then. I'll make sure that you get in another way. Open up! Once I deactivate the alarm, you should be able to open the back door. WRONG CODE To get into Rose's office, you have to go upstairs. - Before that you have to get past Mince. - Mince? The bouncer. - Why "Mince"? - If you annoy him, he turns you into... - I got it. Mince. - Yes. Then we have to get past Kebab. He turns people into kebab? No, he just likes to eat it. If we want to get past him, you have to throw a can at his head. Are you mad? Hide behind a curtain and he'll think you ran into the hallway and run after you. Trust me. - Where am I supposed to get a can? - There's one next to you. There. - Mince, I need your help. - Coming. You really have to work on your humor. How did you know that the can plan would work? I didn't. It was a 50/50 chance. I'm not sure whether I like your wild side. You do like it. - Now we'll get your tablet. - Yes. You look there, I'll look here. - Under the desk. - Desk, okay. Yes. - Well, blow me. - Rosalie. You know her as well? Hi! - Hi, are you the lesbian? - Hart! Be careful, bitch! Maybe he needs a real woman. - Don't grab my ass. - I'd never dare to. Come here. - Come here. - What? - You kissed? - She isn't the best kisser. - I can imagine that. - You're a fence and a dealer, Rosalie? Yes. You didn't think that I'd become something proper, did you? Why don't you work as an actress again? I can't believe this. Why didn't you ever call? Why me? Why didn't you call? Fine, back then everything was a little abrupt. Right, bumchuck? Lesbian. All right, how are things? Gruesome men stories? Why would you think that? Well, there used to always be penis alarm. You're really snappy. You've really improved. This isn't her. This neither. No. No. Yes. Finally. If the two women tell the police what we do... things will be over. Over. You're crazy. Who would rape you in prison? Shut up. Wanted person: Carlotta Holzmann. She lives at 3a T√∂teberg Street in Berlin. Got you. It took me 15 years to find my peace. Fifteen damned, painful years. And then she shows up again. Lolle! - Drive faster! - Yes, Mom. I'm driving as fast as I can. Drive faster! I'm too old for this shit. We'll meet again, right? It can't hurt. Your hand. All right. I'll call you. - Fine. - Then we'll do... a better job. Good. She still is a bad kisser. Hey. I can't watch this. Hug and get this over with. Come on. Get lost. Take care of yourself. Dance? No, you're finishing your stupid presentation first. - Just a little... - No! Congratulations. Now you can sell your soul to Hollywood. Yes. At ten a.m. Don't be too enthusiastic. I don't want that pressure anymore. I want to draw comics again. I want to work less and live more. And I don't want to have sex every time I'm fertile so we can have children. - What? - I don't want to hear about your sex life. My sex life is none of your business. So you'll leave your fianc√© and take Sven? Yes. No. I don't know. - Your thinking is wrong. - Really? Forget the guys and first be happy on your own. But I'm 38. I'll probably never have children, then. I only wanted children with Akay. Everything's over for me. Shall we go see him at the hospital? - It's too late. - Too late? It's two a.m. True. Let's dance. Fine, why not? Hi. He's already back from the Harz as well. But now we'll go to Akay. - I'll drive there on my own. - No. Not alone. Where? Where he proposed to me. - Yes. - To the castle. To the castle. I love you, too. I'll go to Akay. Forever. My ass is like my knee. Fucked up. - I need cream for mine. - That sounds weird. - Lolle? - Lolle? - Lolle? - Are you okay? Yes, everything's okay. Lolle, you can't keep doing this. I know. - I know that I have to decide. - Yes. But if I decide, I'll lose one of you. If I die, I'll do it alone. It's my fault. I'll go to Akay. Forever. - Lolle. - Lolle. Hello? She went to the castle. Go! Attack! - I won't run after her anymore. - Me neither. - She's crazy. - I won't make a fool of myself. This can't be true. Incredible. Shit. One point nine meters. I look like Ryan Gosling. - People always call me Ryan Gosling. - May I... - What was your name? - Just for a sec. Chayette, nice. A Native American name. God, thanks. That was quick. - Bumchuck. - I need your help. Let me guess, it's about you and your men. - It's not about me. - That's something new. It's about Dana. I'm listening. There. - Lolle. - Lolle. - We have the right to an answer. - Now! Yes. You'll get it in there. Please get in there. Sorry. You'll get an answer in there. Come. - Where is she? - We'll get her. Follow me! Everyone! I can't keep living like this. What does that mean for us? Hart, I love you. Really. But not in the right way. You would have been the perfect man to start a family with, but I... And we... We tried so often. So often. And if it hasn't worked out so far... If I want children, I want them with the right person. And now I also lost you as friends. This would be a good time to say, "No, Lolle. You didn't." Well... Hey, there she is! Follow her! - Rosalie? - No. Shah-Rukh. - If you want to talk about a raise... - I do. But this time it's about a raise for you. - The Americans are here. - Oh, God. - They have a great offer with them. - How great? Very great. They're offering you ten million for your company shares. - Not rupees, euros. - Ten? Yes, ten. You can finally do what you want to. Like your weird comics that nobody wants to buy. You can do it all now. But you have to worry. They're in your house and want to meet you personally. They said that they'll get on the next plane if you don't show up soon. Lolle, don't screw this up. Ten... God, I wouldn't have any worries anymore. All problems would be gone. Screw Hollywood. But... Hey. I thought you never wanted to see me again. We thought it's a good time to tell you. We... We still are friends. I love you. I love you, too. I love you. Tell me, what are we doing here? Saving a life. - No. - Shit. Where is she? She's there! Where? - Please stop them. - Sure. Lolle. The gate. - This way! Here! - This way! Dana! - Do you know what we need now? - What? The keys. Shit. - Sven? - Harald? Screw you! -Open the gate -No! Tear down this wall! Dana! I never said that Akay was still alive. No. His heart was too weak. - It's not your fault. - It is. I gave him those shitty pills. Because you loved him. Way too much. There is no "too much" in love. If I jump, I'll never have to love again. - True. - Don't say "but." But... one can find the courage to live a new life. How? You need a friend to help you. And you want to be that friend? I meant you. What? This way! Surrendering is for amateurs. So, do you want to help me sort out my life? Keep going! I have ground service. Okay. Okay. Yes. You destroyed our healing tepee. I had to see a urologist because of you two. You've ruined everything. Oh, God! - Give me your hand. - I can't. - Give me your hand. - I can't. Surrendering is for amateurs. That's a stupid saying. You wanted a friend, now you have one. Give me your hand now! Come. Come here. Oh, God. I hate when you say that. I hate it. Stop! You won't get past me. Time for police brutality! - Get lost! - No. Time for heroes. Rosalie? I'm still high. I think I am, too. Fine, I admit it. Miracle Bunny is from my fantasy, but it's not my fault if this escalates. I used to think that size doesn't matter. I have a lot of paperwork to do. Do you want to do tantra with me? I'd love to try tantra. May I take part? Mama, I'll come along. What did you do without me the past 17 years? There's one thing that's better than having a friend. What? Having two. - Come here. - If I have to... Come here, fatty. - No. - Rosalie? Rosalie? Hey. - Don't grab my ass! - Sure! Look, the lifesavers are already here. Let's see. It must be fun to jump down there. - A jump into a new life? - Or just for fun. A jump into a new life. Aren't you afraid of heights? Not anymore. A new life. Why not? You're crazy. But I am too, so... Whatever. One, two, three... Wait... Is a rescue net made to catch five people? Berlin... Berlin! We have to explain to the policeman that it's a misunder... What are you talking about? Shah-Rukh, you have to cell phone Lolle's track. Cell phone Lolle's track? You look like a fringed pillow. Without our tow... You have to come here. And when you're here, we can talk about my... Ouch. But a part of me still is in the past. I realized that today. I have to start again. Yes, quickly. Suck my feet! I love you! - My Hart. - My Sven. Come. I'm listening. My grandma has a skinhead With a railing... I urgently need a vacation. I need physio. Sorry, did I miss anything?
