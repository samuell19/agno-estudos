In 1542, Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo explored a kindly sea to where it meets... a rugged terrestrial paradise - It was the southern coast of California. In 1572, Sir Francis Drake saw it... lazing under a golden sun - perhaps at Monterey. Two centuries later Franciscan Friars built missions... at San Diego, San Gabriel and at San Fernando... Under these Holy teachings the Don and Grandee came... and life moved on through years of peace and contentment. Don Jose Fuerrero and his daughter. You could ride a half day's journey, my friend, and never leave their land! In trouble again, Romauldo... so you comes it this time? I sold Father's sheep for him... and I lost money on a cockfight. You must help me, Josephita! Just this once more! I must get the money to repay Father... some way! No, no! It would be dishonest to take more... and while sleeps, too. The money for the sheep, Father! It was difficult to get... but I got it! Your brother is a saint for honesty, Josephita... just like you are. So life under the Dons drifted on one long siesta in the kindly sun. Until... in January 1848 the industry of a "foreigner" from the United States shattered the peace and quiet of Spanish rule. Janes Marshall had built a mill race on Sutter's Creek. It's gold, Captain Sutter! Sure as you're born... it's gold! Across valley and mountain the news echoed... to San Francisco village! Gold up Caloma way! The creeks are lined with! GOLD IN CALIFORNIA! The news swept the world! and with that gold-mad horde rode thievery and lawlessness. Do you know what you are doing? This is the Rancho Chico... and this stock is ours! SAN FRANCISCO FOLLOWED THE GOLD CRY! Ships deserted! Trains abandoned! Stores closed! Streets emptied! Stranger, there isn't a shovel left in tow. Everything's been sold! Pathfinder, you play nurse maid to our donkeys. 'm going shovel hunting. Good morning, Stranger... and who might you be? Well, I might be the Queen of Sheba... but I am not! My name's B. Jabez Harmon. I'm the jailer here! Mine is D'Arcy... Dermod D'Arcy. I'm searching for supplies to go mining... but no luck. Me... neither! I want to resign this jailing jop... but that's nobody left in town to resign to! For a pick and shovel I can give you an idea how to get away. Wal, sonny, if you've got any ideas 'long that line... I've got the shovels. Thar's all kinds of shovels! Right- handed, left-handed... and back-handed! And look here... if you don't think I was all set to go! But what's keeping me here is my prisoners... two hoss thieves and a bigamist! Well, here's my idea. We'll build a cage... and take them along mining with us! While the newcomers stampeded toward the gold field... the Dons were observing the great fiesta of St. Francis. El Capitan! He will win today! Our money is bet on El Capitan! You will race like never before... eh, El Capitan? Come on! I'm getting all tired out telling you galoots how to do this! This is our rancho, Senor! It is not right you come here! I am sorry, Senorita. I humbly apologize. Pequeno hijo de un puerko! She flatters you! She says you're a little son of pig! You see, Senorita... I understand Spanish. Do not touch me! You... you rabbit! That is a splendid horse you ride, Senor! Such action... and such speed! At the fiesta todaym Senor... the two fastest horses in this country are racing. Let me enter yours? The fiesta? Is that where she is going? Make your wagers for the xext frog race, gents! Hop on before they hop off! Come, Josephita... dance for us! Her father owns the Rancho Chico... a fine place and very rich... until lately. She's a proud little devil! She rejected even me... a Montalvo! Now my one wish is to humble her! The rose, Senorita! Throw us the rose of your love! Never mind, my friend... the race first and then romance. Just ride him, sonny! Point him for home... and he'll do the rest! I thought only two horses were to race, Father. There are three! I have entered the third horse, Don Jose. My ranch may be represented believe. Your pinto is the other entry, Don Emilio. You agree? Certainly! We will make it a sweepstake... five thousand cattle from each! Five Thousand? A peon's bet! Is it made so low out of consideration for Don Jose? A peon's wager, is it? Then we will make it twenty thousand! Father... we have not half that many cattle left. On second thought, I fear I cannot pledge quite that number. But the wager stands, Senors! Twenty thousand head from each of you... against my Rancho Chico! El Capitan! El Capitan! Come on, Pathfinder! Stop picking them daisies! From you I take 20.000 head of cattle... ...and from you, Don Jose... the Rancho Chico! Half the winnings are yours... the cattle or the Rancho Chico. Allow me, Senorita... This is Senor Dermod D'Arcy, the owner of Pathfinder. It is the same like meeting the devil when I am meeting you, Senor! And it's like meeting an angel to meet you, Senorita. Only angels are not quite so mean. In the words of my sister offend you, I will give satisfaction. A lady as lovely as your sister cannot offend, Senor. I'll take Rancho Chico for my share of the winnings. It is too bad... but we must not lose faith, my brother. I like this horse. Let's change! No, no, Senor! This horse is all you Americans have left us! Take a drink and forget it! We'll show how to collect what's coming to you! Why is Romauldo not here for dinner? Well, Pathfinder... we're home! Never have the Guerreros refused welcome to any man. The best wine, Pedro! The best wine for our last guest. To me, a fine horse is mare to be prized than gold. I drink to your gallant horse, Senor! Your home is charming, Senor. What happiness! A place like this, presided over by a wife... ...as lovely as your daughter. Again I tell you in English which my father do not understand... you are a pig! Your daughter says... There are never alone who live with noble thoughts. A toast in English... to the most beautiful girl I have ever seen! Translated into Spanish, Senor, that means... M ay each hair on your head be a candle to light your soul to heaven. Please don't think too harshly of the Strangers who are coming into your California. It is the strongest who settle new lands. They are rough, and sometimes ruthless... but they build Empires! What you say may be true... but it will become their California, hot ours. Forgive me. I am forgetting my duties as a host. I have a rare old brandy... I must see you alone. Meet me outside the gate after I leave. It is important... something about your ranch! Senor, my apology. There is no more Brandy. My Thanks to you, Senor, for your hospitality. Du not take sadness to your sleep, my father. What iw it you have to tell me? I want to talk to you about the new owner of Rancho Chico. ...but that can wait, Senorita. I have lots of other things to talk about, first. I have not come here to listen to your silly talk! I hate you! I wish never to see you again! Carlos Montalvo. I pass the ranch to possession of don Jose and his daughter Josephite. Dermod Darcy My father! My father! Romauldo! Romauldo! Romauldo! ONWARD SWEPT THE TIDE OF EMPIRE! 80.000 in 3 months! Across mountains! Through valleys! By land! By sea! GOLD BOOM TOWNS OF 49! Built a day! Some to become derelicts of a wasteland... others to be foundations for great cities to come! Inside you go! I've let you build this jail... now patronize it! Don't argue! I am not handing out no night keys for this hoosegow! Pathfinder, we're going back to her. Say... who's this we what's going back where... to who? Just Pathfinder and me. Give up digging gold count o' a gal? You're plum loco! Heck! Getting a wife's like getting wife's... and not having finger-nails! NOTICE! NOTICE! FIRST SHIPMENT OF GOLD TWO GENTS NAMED WELLS AND FARGO HAVE FORMED AN EXPRESS COMPANY. GOLD WILL BE TAKEN ON THEIR STAGES... ...TO SACRAMENTO, AND THEN BY SHIP TO THE U.S. MINT AT PHILADELPHIA. FIRST SHIPMENT LEAVES TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT. Gents, our jail's ready for customers! At midnight the law stars... so do your drinking early! Not a drop, sir, during business hours. Me neither, sir. If is not too much trouble... I would like me a room. Go right up and help yourself to number nine... the royal soote! Mr. D'Arcy write me is live in the place. Please tell him I am here, Senor. Go tell D'Arcy there's a lady to see him. She's here... at the hotel! Your little fandango! Senorita! I was just starting back to see you! This was very kind of you, Senor. But it was... too late. My poor father died. I think his heart maybe just break. Josephita... how can I tell you how sorry I am? Do not try. Pity I do not like. I have not send for you to insult me again, Senor! You come to our California for gold... and for it you give only unhappiness and make hate! You! You have take our lands! You have kill my father! Is this not enough? I am sorry, Senor. The tongue should not speak what is in the heart. Senorita, won't you go back to your home again? No, I am go to relatives in San Diego... then I go to Spain. But your brother is at the ranch, isn't he? Romauldo go way the afternoon before our father die... I do not know where. Wells and Fargo are coming! They're here, boys! Wells... Fargo! On time, gentlemen! On time to a split second! There cheers for Wells and Fargo! Loosen your collars... and come on! This express company is going to make the west and east neighbors... one great empire! Now I have gold to head back east with mine babies where doctors can treat them. Don't you see... it isn't hate that gold is bringing it is happiness... ...and, if you will only understand, it will bring happiness, to you, too, Josephita. We'll burn a cabin on the outskirts. That will draw the crowd away. Then we'll move in on Mr. Wells and Mr. Fargo. When we see the blaze, we'll come and come a-shooting! Senor, I have no heart for this! Let mh go away! No, we aren't leaving no evidence like you... loose! Fire! Fire! See them run... They swallowed the bait easy. Don't go, boys... it's a trick! Look out for a raid!
