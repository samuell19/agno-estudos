ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER LARRY MERCHANT: When the bell rang in a Roberto Durén fight you felt something's going to happen. To be able to be in the ring 119 times over 40 years it's unparalleled. He did it. He was absolutely ferocious, he was fearless. The greatest lightweight in boxing history. He always pressed the action. He always brought that charisma, that anger. ROBERT DE NIRO: Roberto was a great fighter and he's an interesting character. Flamboyant, flashy. It's frightening to see his upbringings and how he has survived that. A young man from Panama who brought the people together. He was a catalyst for hope, aspiration. He kept it all alive. CROWD CHEERS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: REPORTER: The continents of North America and South America are connected by a narrow link of land, Central America. As explorers and traders learnt more about Central America they found that the shortest path from ocean to ocean was across the area known today as the Republic of Panama. SPORTSCASTER: There ’s the ﬁery Panamanian Dura’n right on Buchanan again. REPORTER: The United States built a great Panama Canal controlling the trade routes from north to south and east to west. We should and those negotiations and tell the General: ”We bought it, we paid for it, we built it and we intend to keep it”. INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER REPORTER: Shipping through the Panama Canal and the nearly 10,000 American troops guarding it were not affected by the unrest. REPORTER 2: The canal would be a prime target for an aggressor seeking to disrupt peace and security. REPORTER 3: The US Senate declared it would always respect Panamanian sovereignty. REPORTER 4: Preparing for the crackdown the government had ordered the closure of banks, schools and government offices. THEY CHANT: USA! SPORTSCASTER: A tremendous right hand by Duran. INDISTINCT CHATTER SPORTSCASTER: Dura’n just cannot be beaten or intimidated. Last night, / ordered US military forces to Panama. GEORGE BUSH: And we will not be intimated by the bullying tactics brutal though they may be, of the dictator, Noriega. GUNSHOTS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: LARRY MERCHANT: He found an order in a disorderly universe when he was a child, in learning how to fight. Not just to fight, but howto fight. SPRINGS TOLEDO: Duran was a product of want. Duran was a product of poverty. You have a natural fighter here. You have someone who's driven by vivid memories of going to bed hungry and dirt floors and barrels lit on fire for heat. ROBIN DURAN: He didn't have a family, a proper family. He was abandoned by his father and he had to rough it out on the streets. He had to make a living since very young, selling newspapers, shining shoes on the streets and trying to support his family while being a five—year—old kid. So, it was hard for him. IN SPANISH: Well, the Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long—term lease. It is sovereign United States territory. Where do prize fighters come? They come from desperate, poor circumstance. In the sport of boxing it requires such emotional strength, determination the experience of being in very difficult situations daily. Pain, living with pain every day. It's not a stretch to walk into a boxing gym. CROWD ROARS SPORTSCASTER: Dynamite in both hands and he ’3 showing it tonight. LARRY MERCHANT: There has to be some inner fire that wants to escape from where he came and from what he'd seen and some desire just to... beat other people up. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: Ray Arcel had 20 world champions. Now, keep in mind this is not 20 belt holders or a few world champions and belt holders. These are legitimate true champions, divisional kings and Ray Arcel had 20 of them. He wasn't the typical trainer that you would think of. He was more like, as somebody described him, "He dressed like a banker." He was very much a gentleman. He was very elegant and he cared for his fighters very much. / always felt that there was no one could beat him. / told him one time, / said: ”/f you fought the heavyweight champion of the world, you could win. ” ROBERT DE NIRO: Roberto was his last fighter and he was, at that time, close to 80 and he was not wanting to go back into it. He did because Roberto was so special. This kind of like a father—son relationship which I think that they had. Every trainer has a different work ethic. Every trainer has a different way of instilling in their fighter a fighting style. Ray Arcel called him a natural fighter. In other words, they clearly didn't have to teach him much. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: MARVIN HAGLER: All these guys learn a lot of stuff from the streets and whatever and they bring it into the ring. Being a champion is something that you gotta learn and you gotta learn it the hard way. And the most of us, we had nothing to start out with. So, we ain't got nothing to lose. HE CHUCKLES SPORTSCASTER: He ’3 gone! There is no getting up from that. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: APPLAUSE SPRINGS TOLEDO: Ken Buchanan was the favourite. He was very good, if not a great fighter. Well, I was a boxer and Roberto was a fighter. I knew what I was up against, like. Roberto, you seem very confident that this is going to be a knockout. Now, let’s go a step further and tell me the round. IN SPANISH: LARRY MERCHANT: Duran had this absolute certainty that he would win. I remember thinking: "What does he know that we don't know?" STEVE LOTT: When the bell rang for round one it was like Duran's coming out to end the fight like you just stole something from him. He fought Ken Buchanan as if Ken Buchanan mugged his mother. SPORTSCASTER: Oh, he really hurt him that time! He just had the guts to keep going throwing punches at me and hoping they were going to land. He had just turned 21 years old ten days earlier. He combined his aggression with being elusive. And for Buchanan, to withstand that for round after round it was a tremendous effort. Duran was fighting for a nation. REPORTER: The trouble began when a group of American high school pupils flew an American flag without the Panamanian flag by its side. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: REPORTER: And before the Panamanian National Guard the police and US troops brought the rioters under control more than a score were dead, including four US soldiers. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: GUILLERMO COCHEZ: The Panamanians cannot talk politics. Cannot talk in the papers, because we don't have freedom of speech. Duran came as a symbol of opportunity to express ourselves as a country of oppression. SPORTSCASTER: / don ’t think Buchanan has ever been in this much trouble. Duran knew how to pace himself naturally. He also had a lot of stamina, he kept on going. He was just relentless going after him with his head as well as his fists and eventually, he just broke him down. BELL RINGS KEN BUCHANAN: He hit me low and that was it. Like, the referee... He just stopped the fight. SPORTSCASTER: And the winner and new lightweight champion of the world 21—year—old Roberto Duran of Panama. SPRINGS TOLEDO: That moment announced Duran on the world stage without a doubt. A fighter arises from their midst who became one of the all—time greats. Something personal driving him. I'm not sure if Duran even understood what it was but there was something that was primal. JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: SPORTCASTER CHATTERS IN SPANISH He was naturally aggressive, but he could also box. MIKE TYSON: Ferocity and savage punching, speed... People never know him as fast, but he's very fast. He has a great anticipation of punching. He's just an all—around marvel in the ring. "Manos de Piedra" as a tag is so perfect for him because it feels like... His hands feel like freaking bricks. I've talked to fighters that have fought him and everyone underestimates him. They think they can win until they're in the ring with him. IN SPANISH: HE CHUCKLES I actually have been in the ring in a fashion, with Roberto. He was in Rocky ll. He's supposedly Rocky's sparring partner. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: At first, I thought, this will be pretty interesting because, you know, I was a few pounds heavier, a little taller and then I realised the difference between amateur and consummate pro. The way he could move his head just an inch... It's impossible to hit him. This man would demolish me in... Put it this way: if it was a fight, the fight would be 11 seconds including the count. SPORTSCASTER SPEAKS SPANISH JOHN DINGES: Every county is more than just its politics. Cultural heroes are particularly important in times of political unrest. CROWD ROARS The Panamanian people always identified themselves with Duran especially during his fights. I mean, you know, it was a national fever. He won, we won. ROBERTO DIAZ HERRERA IN SPANISH: IN SPANISH: REPORTER: The demonstration was organised by Panama ’3 strongman, General Omar Torrijos. DON KING: He was remarkable. He was strong, he was firm to promote the upward mobility of the Panamanian people. REPORTER: The presence of 50,000 Americans here at the Canal Zone have always been emotional issues in Panama and Torrijos has demanded Panamanian sovereignty over the zone. JOHN DINGES: You could call him a military strongman but that doesn't really capture who he was. He was a populist. He was somebody who identified down, identified with the people. WOMAN: They have the weapons and the tanks given by the United States but we have our dignity and we are going to fight. We don ’t care if we die. JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: REPORTER: In Washington on September 7th, President Carter and the Panamanian president, General Omar Torrijos signed two treaties for Washington to surrender the Canal and Zone gradually to Panama by the year 2000. JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: And what is to say that once we have declared we are willing to give up that canal that he can ’t just cancel out the rest of the treaty? IN SPANISH: JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: LARRY MERCHANT: Nobody cared in those days about "unbeaten". What they cared about is what Duran did, which is you fight the best guys out there. You take your chances, you take risks. What really shows you what he has going on inside is that his greatest fights were still yet to come. At the end of the day, the talent makes the fights but you've got to have the promoters in order to plug them, to sell them to get the tickets out, to get the crowd interested. You know, to get everybody's juices flowing. LENNOX LEWIS: You know, the rise of the promoters was very important because they really brought out boxing. The promoters are the ones that make that happen and if it wasn't for them making it happen, we wouldn't be able to watch great events. Definitely worth $20 to see it. I’ll be there. REPORTER: Why is it worth that much to see this fight? Hey, that’s once in a century. That’s gonna be the best fight / ever seen in my life. There's been a little bit more of a razzmatazz come to the boxing game over the years, you know? And it has made non—boxing people boxing fans, you know what I mean? So they have served their point and none more so than Don King and Bob Arum. ...that you will see on Monday night will be one of the greatest ﬁghts in history. LENNOX LEWIS: Arum and King, they were like... apples and oranges, you know? Same bag of groceries, but different fruits. DON KING: I was a great promoter, you know? And I say that immodestly, but I'm just a fact. You know, not braggadocio, just a fact of what it is. ROBIN DURAN: They were probably the pioneers and they were the ones who planted the seed for boxing to be what it is today. They were rivals. Every time they would find a great fight, they would make it happen. My relationship with King, throughout that period, was very adversarial. I think it benefitted both of us. He played off me, I played off him. I would have never known how good I was if I didn't have lonesome Bob. Can't tell him what to do neither. When he gets passionate and he gets on a tyrant or a rage he just goes, man. You know what? It's no holds barred. You got to be on your P's and Q's when you're dealing with Bob Arum. He was a treacherous foe, you know, and an admirable friend. Tremendously adept at promoting himself. A lot of promotional activities were centred on Don King as the promoter. DON KING: He got his idiosyncrasies and I have mine, you know what I mean? So, you know, sometimes we can make the twain meet, you know what I mean? So we could be friends today and foes tomorrow. MAURICIO SULAIMAN: The rivalry between them was as important as the one from the fighters. So, people knew when there was a fight involving both it would be a tremendous event. Duran is cal/ed, / mean, if we read the sports pages here one of the toughest punchers for his weight. He ’3 certain/y maybe the toughest puncher you’ve ever faced. He ’3 a bra w/er, street—fighter. Somebody said it’s like being hit by a rock to be hit by this guy. Scared? Just a little. HE CHUCKLES BOB ARUM: Ray was America's sweetheart. He had won the Olympic gold medal in Montreal in 1976. And Ray had a great smile and a great personality. So, he was America's darling. An absolute master boxer at welterweight, you know? The golden boy, if you like. LARRY MERCHANT: A celebrated young fighter in America. Brilliant Ali—like smile but there were still some questions out there. Could he stand in with a really tough guy? Sugar Ray Leonard, for his first fight, he earned $40,000. Roberto Duran was 16 years old. He probably earned a couple of mangoes. So Duran looked upon Leonard and felt something like rage about what Leonard had. SYLVESTER STALLONE: An Olympian who was America's sweetheart against... HE SIGHS a... a... a demon. A destruction machine. It just made for great theatre. Especially in America, since the beginning of time, you could always pitch good vs evil. People were just beginning to adjust to the presence of Hispanics in the United States. There was a lot of anti—Hispanic feeling. Duran instinctively played his role as that villain. During the press conference to announce the fight the guy walked into that room. His eyes, his expressions... His demeanour was so... just violent and just nasty. HE SPEAKS SPANISH ”/’m not here to be a clown like this guy over here. ” CROWD LAUGHS ROBERTO DURAN SPEAKS SPANISH "This is the first time in his life he ’s gonna have to get in the ring and fight. ” Today / said a few words. / looked at him and he was ready to fight. He took his rings off and everything. / think he was ready. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: When Ray's wife Juanita would go out of the hotel to go shopping Duran would come down and follow in a car and say the vilest things. SUGAR RAY LEONARD: It bothered me as a man. lt bothered me as a guy. It bothered me as a fighter. And you don't insult a man's wife, girl... You don't do that, and l was gonna get him back. l was gonna get him back. With Roberto, it was an act. It really was an act. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: It meant for tremendous closed—circuit sales. It was a blockbuster because he played his role of the villain to perfection. CROWD CHEERS SPORTSCASTER: Live from Montreal, Canada. It's the WBC World ’3 Welterweight Championship. Sugar Pa y Leonard vs Roberto Dura’n. We are in on one of the historic events in all of history. More people tonight will see this telecast than have ever witnessed a cable telecast before, closed—circuit. Throughout my career, I never walked to the ring angry. Except that fight. And I remember vividly in Montreal, walking to that ring, I mean... My mind was thinking toe—to—toe, toe—to—toe with this guy. CROWD CHEERS Leonard, prior to the fight, said to himself: "I wanna knock this guy out." Leonard wanted to stand toe—to—toe with one of the most vicious fighters of all time. I thank him for that, because it made it a great fight. SUGAR RAY LEONARD: I remember the bell going. Bing, first round. I didn't foresee any problem... until he hit me. INDISTINCT COMMENTARY I've never been hit that hard. Duran was perpetual motion. He was tenacious, aggressive and... IN SPANISH: SPRINGS TOLEDO: Duran had a lot of old school tricks. There's something called the "Fitzsimmons shift". He would throw a dummy right hand and immediately go into a southpaw position and then he would drive in a left hook or a left uppercut to the solar plexus. That is high—tech, sophisticated strategy. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: He ’3 playing games with him. Leonard is... Oh, man, he's throwing these hydrogen bombs and he's throwing 'em at 30 punches per second and, boom, it's like he's dancing. It's like it's ballet and I'm saying: "Woah, he's making punches miss." I'm just... "Man! God! Damn!" They weren't far from each other. They're real close and the movements were... "Oh!" Man, you couldn't believe how close they were throwing punches. SPORTSCASTER: Right above is Roberto Dura’n. And after seeing that fight, I knew this was what I wanted to do. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: Remember Leonard has never lost a fight. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: Duran thinks he has won the fight. / can ’t believe it. BELL RINGS - SPORTSCASTER: The bell! It’s over! CROWD CHEERS SPORTSCASTER: He thinks he ’3 won this fight and then he has to fight the 15th round./ SPORTSCASTER 2: / think he thought so. He thinks he ’3 won. / think he thought he won. I think you can be fairly certain that Duran, at that point in his career was not hiding his feelings. SPORTSCASTER: Now he ’s yelling at Benitez. Most fighters'd just take the win. "Thank you very much" and get out. He was like: "No, have it. That's what it's all about." That's why I loved him. He was X—rated for television at the time. At the time, he was giving people the finger, grabbing his crotch and I thought that was incredible. SUGAR RAY LEONARD: I said: "I don't need this anymore." I really contemplated retirement. I said: "I can't take this." You know, "I can't take this, man." Duran had given him a beating like he had never received in his life and he told me: "Sly, that night, I could move every one of my teeth back and forth as if they literally were hanging in my gums. I thought all my teeth were going to come out." That's how hard he hit. Yeah. I told Sly, I told a lot of people that... Most people don't... were not privy to this, the fact that he hit me like that. My forward teeth went back and I went back to the corner and I asked my cornerman. I said: "Guys, are my teeth knocked back?" And they said: "No, Ray, you're fine, you're fine." Cos they didn't want to, you know, upset me. HE SCOFFS But... I do remember that. SPRINGS TOLEDO: In my opinion, Sugar Ray Leonard proved his greatness losing to Duran. Roberto Duran, on the other hand, is a different beast. It's almost like he moved to Sodom and Gomorrah. He just indulged. CROWD WHISTLES CROWD CHEERS CROWD PLAYS MUSIC DON KING: Duran was a fighter of the people. He related and identified with them the downtrodden and the underprivileged and denied. CROWD CHEERS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: DON KING: It was ecstasy. It was a celebration of all the people. You know, because the celebration... it was en masse, it was grandiose. Everybody was there. Babies, their mothers, their grandfathers. Everybody was there because it was a family reunion, as they would say. The prodigal son is returning home, so to speak. SPRINGS TOLEDO: A month—long party is what it was. Now, you can understand that Duran denies himself when he trains. So, in other words, he's reliving his childhood when he trains. That's a little bit of a trauma for him, it's a mini—trauma if you will. So after he wins, sometimes after he lost, he would indulge. He would enjoy the fruits of his labour. Duran being Duran, he did it a little too much but that's how he was wired. MUSIC PLAYS MAURICIO SULAIMAN: He was always the guide. In the difficult years, they had Roberto Duran to represent them, and save them and give them pride. So he was, and still is, the most famous Panamanian today. He can do whatever he wants in Panama. He can get away with anything. HE SINGS IN SPANISH IN SPANISH: HE SINGS IN SPANISH RICKY HATTON: I got a phone call saying he was gonna pick me up with his brother at the airport. I expected him to be kerbside but he wasn't. He was right through at the gate when I got off the plane. He went: "Ricky, Ricky!" and he took me through passport control. Passport control were saying: "Roberto, Roberto, passport!" He was like: "No, no, no" and he took me right through. I thought "How famous are you to take me right through passport control?" Wherever restaurant we went to, we would never have to pay anything because he would always say: "People love me here." So it was a treat to see him in his home town, in his country where people adore him. JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: He's still like a little boy, you know? I come into his house and he's watching cartoons. You know, he didn't have a childhood. It's part of what he is today. It gave him that anger to fight. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: Only people who doesn't have places to live go to El Chorillo. People without work. People involved in detailing drugs. Criminal groups. That was El Chorillo. IN SPANISH: I think it's wine, women and song. You know, the fighters work so hard and they live such a Spartan life that it's so difficult to maintain that training regimen and that discipline and quite often you just wanna enjoy your youth and they get a little carried away. They come from poverty and they've never had anything and now they have millions of dollars and temptation is just around the corner. Duran is not the first great athlete or fighter who got more attracted by the distractions than the main event. LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC PLAYS LARRY MERCHANT: It's human. Young guys on top of the world. More money than they could imagine. Everybody telling them how wonderful they are. HE SINGS IN SPANISH BOB ARUM: I remember visiting him at his house. There must have been 40 people and they were all laying around the pool with Dom Perignon champagne, only the best. Cooking steaks and living the high life on Duran's money. He partied... partied... Well, he celebrated, I should say, he celebrated a lot more than I did. And I wanted to catch him off guard. CROWD ROARS SUGAR RAY LEONARD: After the fight, I was really emotionally just down. Devastating. But I took my wife to Hawaii to kinda cool out. And while I was there, the first thing I did the next morning was run, did road work. I'm running down the beach and people saying: "Hey, Sugar, man, tough fight." "Hey, Sugar Ray, if you'd have boxed him, you would have beat him." I kept hearing that: "If you had boxed him, you would've beat him." "If you were boxing..." And something said: "Bing!" I called my partner, Mike Trainer. I said: "Mike, I wanna fight Duran ASAP." PHONE RINGS Hello ? IN SPANISH: SPRINGS TOLEDO: Training would not be spent devising new strategies and tactics to defeat Sugar Ray Leonard who was now going to try a different strategy of course. No. It was spent losing weight. This time around will be a different story altogether. Me no like you, Leonard. Leonard too much talk. Everybody rush out there, closed—circuit, and get their tickets because this is gonna be World War / V. It's hard for an outsider to know how prepared a fighter is even when he says, as he usually does, that he's in the best shape of his life. CROWD CHEERS SPORTSCASTER: Here we go, the WBC Welterweight Championship. There ’3 Sugar Ray Leonard in the black trunks and Roberto Dura’n, the champion in the white trunks, from Panama. BELL RINGS SYLVESTER STALLONE: Roberto Duran comes to battle. He knew that toe—to—toe, he would win that fight. SPORTSCASTER: And he ’3 even doing a little dodging now. A little A/I'. He ’3 taunting Dura’n. SYLVESTER STALLONE: He didn't realise the strategy of Sugar Ray Leonard was almost sleight of hand. Magic. Illusion. Duran became incredibly frustrated. Embarrassed. SPORTSCASTER: Sugar Ray is taunting Roberto Dura’n like Ali. Leonard was just too fast, too crafty and it got into the skin of Duran. LARRY MERCHANT: Duran could not abide. Those eyes that used to stare at someone and stare you down were now just, like, lost. The taunting that went on, the antics were to pour some acid on this machismo. SUGAR RAY LEONARD: He had no cure. He had no response for what I was doing in that ring. SPORTSCASTER: Sugar Ray is oozing confidence. Look at that! Well, he saw what to do and he did it. Old school fighters would frown upon that. A lot of old school commentators back then frowned upon that. They did not like to see... Even Howard Cossell did not like to see Sugar Ray Leonard acting in this manner against a great fighter like Roberto Duran. But Sugar Ray Leonard is gonna do what works for Sugar Ray Leonard. Those things, those "antics" or whatever you call them, happen in the ring. It always happened and you can't... you don't think about doing that. You would never think about sticking your chin out against Roberto Duran, trust me but it worked then and there, instinctively. It just naturally happened because I saw something in his eyes: I saw that he was not there. SPRINGS TOLEDO: The crowd laughed. The people began to laugh at Roberto Duran. SPORTSCASTER: Both men can throw lethal bombs. LARRY MERCHANT: The machismo at that point said... "Enough, I'm not going to be humiliated like this anymore." SPRINGS TOLEDO: Something snapped. CROWD ROARS SPORTSCASTER: Hey, what’s happening? Dura’n says no! / think he ’s quitting. What is he saying, Larry? - LARRY: He says no. / don ’t understand it. - SPORTSCASTER: He ’3 saying no. He quit! LARRY: / don ’t understand this. SPORTSCASTER: / think Dura’n quit. - LARRY: / don ’t understand it. CROWD JEERS COMMENTATORS CLAMOUR SPORTSCASTER: Gentlemen, Roberto Duran. .. LARRY: This is not like Duran. BROADCASTER: threw his hands up and said: ”/ quit”. LARRY: / don ’t understand this. SPORTSCASTER: And he almost got in a fight with Leonard ’s brother. The police are in the ring and we have a very, very unpleasant situation in there. LARRY: / don ’t understand this. SPORTSCASTER: The referee has not declared the fight over yet. Duran sudden/y said: "/ quit”. LARRY: / don ’t understand it. - SPORTSCASTER: / don ’t either. And then he did it a second time. LARRY: / don ’t understand it. CROWD CLAMOURS LARRY: / don ’t understand. - SPORTSCASTER: What happened? He ’3 saying: "/ don ’t want it anymore ”. And there ’3 no question, ladies and gentlemen that Sugar Ray Leonard has retaken the World ’3 Welterweight Championship in round eight when Dura’n surrendered. VOICE FADES IN SPANISH: I could not be more stunned at anything that ever happened in a prize fight than seeing Roberto Duran quit. The crowd was shocked. Worldwide, it was shocking. In Spanish, no ma’s means "no more". The fight became the No Mas fight. All you had to say or all that was written was "no mas". When he did so many good things, so many great things in boxing than that simple phrase. Some people forget about him being the greatest lightweight champion of all time and they simply say: "No mas". Now, Luis, exactly what happened in Roberto ’3 words? HE SPEAKS SPANISH He got cramps in his stomach and his body, upper body. And then his arms. And he got weaker, so that’s why he stopped, he quit the bout. Does this mean the end of boxing for Roberto? THEY SPEAK SPANISH ”Yes, I’m not fighting anymore. ” This is final, permanent retirement? ”Definite/y, I’m not fighting anymore. ” SPORTSCASTER: Leonard scored with a chopping right that hurt Dura’n. When Dura’n motioned that that was it / just felt that / beat a man, a legend, mental/y you know, more so than physical/y. DON KING: Ray Leonard was using his skills and his physical adroitness and his mental capacity to be able to do that. He played the mental gymnastics as well as the physical. Duran was right for it. You know, instead of him readjusting he stayed on that same mode, and so since he got frustrated with that misguided emotionalism and passion he then played right into Ray's hands, but Ray wasn't expecting him to stop. IN SPANISH: Sugar Ray had a plan and, you know, his plan worked. To frustrate him, not to fight him. If anybody come to fight Duran, he'll fight you to the death but, you know, he gets caught up in that macho mentality, "He's not fighting me, he's not the man." I think for a man who, in his chest beats the heart of a warrior the frustration and the embarrassment and the pressure from the audience I'm sure he's... regrets that moment every day. There is no amount of money. There is nobody that can do anything that would help this man with the destruction of his reputation or the doubt that has been cast upon his reputation and he ’3 going to be out of boxing. He ’l/ have to live that for the rest of his life. It’s gonna be a real traumatic experience. HOWARD COSSELL: Ray, you heard what Duran said. Will you fight him again, ever? No, Howard. It's a painful moment. It's a painful moment for boxing history because it did hurt the sport. It not only hurt Duran, it really demolished his reputation. But it also hurt everything about the sport because people paid good money to see a great rematch and what happened was Duran basically ripped everybody off. I’ve never seen this young man behave in this manner. I’ve been with him nine years. He ’3 been through tough fights and l was absolutely astounded. / wish / could give you an honest answer, Howard, of what really happened. This is my interpretation, I'm not sure if I'm right but he was disappointed, deeply disappointed that he would pull out like that and probably heartbroken in some ways because you just don't do that. It was just one of those... too human moments... of weakness. "But to thine own self one must be true", as Shakespeare would say. The man in the mirror knows that he did that to himself because of that machismo, macho attitude and life that he had lived, you know what I mean? IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: LARRY MERCHANT: How do you go back to your people, your fans who have constructed a part of their lives around you who worship you and look up to you? You become a champion, you have an entourage of 50 people carrying your suitcase, your backpack, giving you water, cleaning your sweat. You lose your championship, you lose your money, you have nobody again. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: REPORTER: Good evening. One of Central America ’s best known military and political leaders, General Omar Torrijos has died in a plane crash in the jungle, 91 miles outside of Panama City. He was 52. REPORTER 2: The Panamanian National Guard gave their General a military farewell complete with a motorcycle escort and cavalry. Torrijos’ coffin draped with the Panamanian flag was carried up the steps to the cathedral on the shoulders of the members of his national guard. He was their commander and chief. DON KING: Torrijos is a victim of the system. That he was such an advocate for the people and next thing you know, his plane is crashing into a mountain. An accident, but in my opinion by design and the world lost a great statesman, a great scholar, a great fighter. Torrijos became a symbol of protest a symbol of a different military and also identified with the lower class with the workers, with people like Duran. WOMEN WAIL ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: JOHN DINGES: Panama never was the same again after Torrijos. Of course, his death leads to the rise of Noriega. APPLAUSE RUBEN PAREDES IN SPANISH: JOHN DINGES: Noriega had a relationship with the CIA very intimate and very profitable. He goes on the CIA payroll and the Pentagon payroll cooperating with the US on the one hand and violating US law on the other hand. IN SPANISH: JOHN DINGES: He begins a relationship with the Medillin Cartel, Pablo Escobar at a time when drug trafficking is starting to explode coming out of Colombia. Panama becomes one of the most important havens for laundering millions and millions of dollars being produced by trafficking cocaine, marijuana, in and out of the United States. Panama was where business was being done and Noriega was facilitating drug operations in his country. Noriega has taken control literally at the point of a gun. It's absolutely irresponsible for anyone to think the people of Panama want him they don't. MANUEL NORIEGA IN SPANISH: HE CHUCKLES HE LAUGHS See? I tell you. SUGAR RAY LEONARD: It's not easy to come back after being ridiculed. After being looked down upon. It's gonna do one of two things to you. It's gonna make you a better fighter or it's gonna destroy you. IN SPANISH: FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: RICKY HATTON: The first time you find out how good a fighter you are and how big a man you are in boxing when you've gotta drag your backside up off the floor and come back from adversity which is what Roberto found himself having to do after the No Mas fight. REPORTER: This is the island of Coiba a tough penal colony and a sort of De vil’s Island where Panama ’3 most menacing criminals are sent. It’s also become home to one of the most bizarre training camps of all time. Roberto Duran has spent the last six weeks working here sweating himself into shape, surrounding himself with men much harder, meaner and tougher than him. SPORTSCASTER: Good right hand by Kirk/and Laing. A lead right and that tagged Dura’n on the chin. Duran had a go at Laing... IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: / don ’t wanna remember Duran this way. At 31 years of age, it may be all over for Hands of Stone. IN SPANISH: Being a champion is very important. I would say if I didn't lose in my career I wouldn't know how great I would have been, cos it put me in a place and then it was for me, mentally and physically, to get myself out of it and show that I'm a true champion. SPORTSCASTER: Cuevas against the ropes down for the second time in the round. Cue vas a beaten fighter. Dura’n, a good right hand set it all off went to the kill. Roberto Dura’n back in the title picture again. In fact, he will be fighting Davey Moore for the Junior Middle weight Championship. Pandemonium in the ring. CROWD ROARS CROWD CHANTS: Dura’n! Dura’n! Dura’n! BELL RINGS SPRINGS TOLEDO: For Duran to consent to step in the ring with Davey Moore twenty—four years old one of the best junior middleweights in the world so long after Duran's prime so far out of his natural division against a fighter who has exceeded Sugar Ray Leonard's dimensions... Once again Duran was an underdog. MIKE TYSON: I'm 17 years old, I'm in Madison Square Garden and right there in the front row and I'm going: "Yeah, yeah yeah!" And he goes like this. Yo, he was looking at me! Well, that was a sign. That's a sign I'm gonna make it big. cos he saw me out of all those thousands of people. I thought it was all about me. He don't fucking know me! MARVIN HANGLER: Davey Moore was up—and—coming and Roberto Duran showed me what kind of skill that he really had at that time. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: CROWD CHEERS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: When he won the fight as an underdog, which nobody expected him to win I think he made the people of Panama very, very proud of him again. CROWD CHEERS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: CROWD CHANTS: Dura’n! SPORTSCASTER: On his 32nd birthday last night challenger Roberto Duran knocked out 24—year—old Davey Moore to win the World Boxing Association, Junior Middle weight Championship. CROWD CHEERS LARRY MERCHANT: There's no doubt that beating Moore brought Duran back to life as a prize fighter. FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH: ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: The '80s was really dominated by the Four Kings. They all fought each other. Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler... lt’s war. MAURICIO SULAIMAN: Tommy Hearns. Roberto Duran. Those four, they truly represent perhaps the best times of boxing. BOB ARUM: Everybody thought initially that once Muhammad Ali departed from the scene that boxing would suffer a real terrible blow. But it was those four fighters that revitalised the sport during the '80s. They fought nine times in various combinations and every time they fought, it was a major, major event. LARRY MERCHANT: Each fight among them became a drama. Oh, not since Cain and Abel have you seen one like this. Every fight was an event. OSCAR DE LA HOYA: The Four Kings era without Roberto Duran it wouldn't have been the same. He was a fighter who would take on all challengers. He would move up several weight classes and challenge the very best. He was a serious threat to anybody. SPORTSCASTER: And indeed this historic event is Roberto Duran challenging Marvelous Marvin Hag/er for the undisputed Middle weight Championship. FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH: Back in the day, you fought the best. You had to work yourself in the rankings to become a champion. They all wanted to fight each other. They wanted to fight each other. They didn't have to, they didn't make 'em, they wanted it. SYLVESTER STALLONE: This was an era when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. These were the real deals, real specimens and Hagler was perfection in his particular weight class which is much bigger than Roberto. Basically, this guy was trying to take away my title and I said: "No. There's no way that you're going to take away my title," you know. It was a psych game, like, going on between him and I. Two day more, you no more champion. - OK. He was at the height of his game at nine stone, nine. And all of a sudden, he fights one of the greatest middleweights of all time. Up at 11 stone, six. Every morning, I used to see his ugly face. My entourage and his entourage we used to run around the dunes. We would see each other like 4:30 in the morning and just before the fight and we go, "Rrrrrr!" And he goes, "Rrrrrr!" ROBERTO DURAN SPEAKS SPANISH He says: "Thank you very, very much to all of you ” and he don ’t care of nothing because he knows how to do it on top of the ring. REPORTER: / notice you didn’t shake his hand. Has the psyching already started toward that? MARVIN HANGLER: Oh, yeah. Roberto ’3 very tricky, very cagey. Uh, he ’s got a lot of heart. One thing that / believe that / won ’t have to look for him. So, it’s going to be an exciting fight. You ’re gonna see a good performance. I’m sure Duran is going to give a good account of himself HANGLER FAN: He ’3 too strong, much too fast for Dura’n. He ’3 in better shape. He ’3 got just as much experience. DURAN FAN: The last time Hag/er had a fight was against Vito Antofuermo five years ago. He hasn ’t had a fight since and Dura’n’s gonna give him a fight cos Duran ’s gonna hit him downstairs, Duran’s gonna hit him upstairs. And it’s gonna be all over within a short time. CROWD CHANTS: Dura’n! To do a 15—round fight in that heat, outdoors... They weren't in the casinos now, and the air conditioning. That was absolutely unbelievable. CROWD ROARS MARVIN HANGLER: The way that I look at that fight, I mean it was two great champions going in, teaching each other what kind of skills that they had. SPORTSCASTER: Middle weight Championship of the world. SPORTSCASTER 2: Hag/er, of course, familiar to most people that left—handed style. Remember, he will switch to righty at various times throughout this fight. IN SPANISH: For the first three rounds, what he would do was every time that I would throw a right hand he would counter—punch. And I says: "Hmm" for three rounds and I'm asking my trainer "How the hell does this guy keep catching me?" "He's a smart warrior and he's timing your punch." So, what we had to do was we had to go to school on him show him who he's in there with, switch up on him and every time that he would do that right hand... Boom, I hit him with a body shot and I hear him go, "Ugh!" HE LAUGHS He can't believe that he's getting hit this much because nobody hits Roberto Duran that much. "You hit me, do you know who I am?" I say: "Yeah, and you gonna get some more, too. C'mon!" HE LAUGHS SPORTSCASTER: Big left hand from Hag/er on the chin of Duran but Duran is OK. RICKY HATTON: The fight was toe—to—toe, nonstop. There was barely a foot, two foot between them the whole fight because Roberto Duran fought that way and Marvin fought that way. It was always going to be a close—quarter fight so that for a 15—round fight... Fantastic, fantastic stuff. SPORTSCASTER: Here in this 15th round. Ripping, body and head shots to the head of Roberto Dura’n. MARVIN HANGLER: I give him a lot of credit, man. He was so experienced that he knew how to keep bouncing off the rope and bobbing and weaving and avoiding some of the punches. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: Two warriors, two champions going the full 15 rounds. MARVIN HANGLER: I tell you, in about 30 more seconds in the 15th round I would have knocked Roberto Duran out. I had him. I had him. HE LAUGHS BELL RINGS - CROWD CHEERS ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: Duran stole the drama of the show simply by going 15 rounds with Marvin Hagler. Having a fighter like Roberto Duran, that brings out the best in you and that's what he did for me. He pushed him all the way, do you know what I mean? Stood there and had it out with him, it was... From someone who was a 9 stone, nine, a lightweight fighter to fight out with one of the strongest and best middleweights of all time. I think, you know, it ended in his defeat but it's again, another one of them, bit by bit each fight and each fight he was having he was getting the respect back from the Panamanian people. IN SPANISH: To me, it isn't always about the victories cos Duran, every fight had just... elements of drama that other fighters just don't have. Every one is almost like a movie in itself. SPRINGS TOLEDO: If you look at the pattern of Duran's career it's pretty rare, especially after 1979 where he could be inspired for a fight twice in a row. To fight Hearns on the heels of Hagler, that's insanity. SPORTSCASTER: No longer will he be called the Motor City Cobra. He has returned as Thomas The Hitman. ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: He had that real devil, evil in his eye, you know? He, you know... Like he wanted to hurt his opponents. SPRINGS TOLEDO: Duran predicted he's going to knock Tommy Hearns out in one round. Thomas Hearns said: "I'm going to knock Roberto Duran out in two rounds." LARRY MERCHANT: It was apparent in that fight that Hearns had no respect for Duran. IN SPANISH: BELL RINGS - SPORTSCASTER: Referee, Carlos Padilla. ROBIN DURAN: He was training in Bahamas. I was very young, I was a kid. And they flew me over with my mum and I saw my father trying to make the weight. IN SPANISH: He looked like a freaking walking dead, you know. Sucking on a lemon. IN SPANISH: You know, he's usually the crazy guy who loves his kid and he's always hugging us and, you know, playing with us. And he's like: "Fula, just take the kids. I can't deal with them right now." IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: Big man and the little man thus far. Right hand! Down goes Duran. Duran is on queer street. IN SPANISH: SPORTSCASTER: He doesn’t know where he is. He ’3 on queer street and he ’3 going to go. Noriega was provoking the military, the US military. RUBEN PAREDES IN SPANISH: RONALD REAGAN: Drugs are menacing our society. They’re threatening our values and undercutting our institutions. The y ’re killing our children. IN SPANISH: This. . . This is crack cocaine. / think we are moving from crisis to disaster and now we are passing disaster and moving towards catastrophe. SPORTSCASTER: Oh, he ’3 out! He was out before he hit the canvas. STEVE LOTT: When that punch landed, it was a "pop". You could hear it from ringside through the ropes into the microphone. That was definitely the hardest punch Duran ever got hit with. SPORTSCASTER: This fight is over. When / have the official time from the... SPORTSCASTER: He doesn’t know where he is. SPORTSCASTER 2: He has not known where he is since the first... Duran was no longer a elite level fighter. He's like: "I can still get in the ring and beat everybody up and..." You know... It was sort of a pressure for us too because everybody coming up to us and like: "Your father should retire." So it was sort of a pressure for not only him but for everybody. FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH: OSCAR DE LA HOYA: He represented never giving up. "If I can do this, you can do it as well." He was that type of fighter. / call on General Noriega to respect the voice of the people. SPORTSCASTER: You know, Al, there ’3 a saying in boxing: ”A fighter can look like he ’s in great condition. All of a sudden he walks up the stairs the bell rings, and he doesn ’t have it anymore. ” That’s happened to Roberto Dura’n, like, three times. We all wrote him off and all of a sudden the guy comes back again. This is going to be some test for a 37—year—old guy against a tough guy like lran Barkley. He has the heart of a champion, of a warrior, and no matter if you're 100 years old or not you're still going to want to fight because it's in you. It's your soul. It's what drives you. It's the Ioneliest of sports but in a way, that makes it, um... better. It makes it bigger. LARRY MERCHANT: They go out, they are alone. There can be whole countries making you... somebody special. CROWD CHEERS SPORTSCASTER: And so the stage is set. There ’s not a seat to be had. And everybody pumped up to see that man, Roberto Dura’n, trying to win his fourth tit/e and to see if Iran The Blade Barkley... Iran Barkley was a rough, tough guy who was from the streets of the Bronx. He was member of a street gang. He was 28 years old. He was in perfect condition. He was a huge middleweight. I was in school... and I remember my teachers telling me: "Don't let your father do this fight," you know, "he's going to get killed." You know, I saw Iran Barkley who was like ten—feet tall. I'm like: "Damn, this guy's going to kill my father." These guys is the past. I gotta be the present. Got a spirit inside of me that I can take myself back to where I came from and what I've done. I'm gonna make you respect me. A promoter would say to a fighter "If you want to fight, your name power is still big enough to put this fight on TV to where you get a pay—day." And that's what keeps fighters going on long after they should retire. SPORTSCASTER: Here ’3 that right hand again. Being very, very proud of your people like Roberto was makes you not want to let them down. You can't tell me he didn't think of that one fight against Sugar Ray Leonard and when he quit, every time he stepped in a ring. He thought to himself: "I can't quit in this one." You can look into a man's eyes, you can see his soul. You don't scare me. Having the guts and having the desire to go beyond physical limits. When you do that, you're a fighter. SPORTSCASTER: They are both landing big shots. Who will go? Dura’n is now stunned. REPORTER: Panama City. American police called on Army help against rioting Panamanians. IRAN BARKLEY: You know, I hit him with a shot that spun him around. I don't even know how he stood up from that. HE CHUCKLES When / heard this stuff about Noriega and invading that is pure fabrication and a lie. SPORTSCASTER: Duran doing a wonderful job of tying him up Something held him up that day that wouldn't let him fall. CROWD CHEERS SPORTSCASTER: So it looks like Roberto Dura’n got his third wind. Where he got it from... IRAN BARKLEY: You know, it held him up somehow. SPORTSCASTER: He said he was in good shape. Roberto Dura’n’s for real in this bout. IRAN BARKLEY: And he just went for it. CROWD CHANTS: Dura’n! Last night, / ordered US military forces to Panama. SPORTSCASTER: Again the right by... Bark/ey's in trouble. He ’3 down! CROWD ROARS This has been extraordinary. BELL RINGS SPORTSCASTER: That tells you who ’3 champion. The victory over Iran Barkley was Duran's last act of defiance. I mean, with that victory, he gave the finger to history. He gave the finger to Father Time. He gave the finger to the laws of physics. IN SPANISH: And now that we're friends, I walk over to him, I say: "Hey, Roberto, how you doing, man?" I said: "Let me ask you a question. Did you hate me that much? Did you really hate me that much?" And he looked at me. He took a deep breath. He said: "No, Ray, that was all... It was all made up." There wasn't this mean spirit about him uh, when you got to know him. I mean, he was just a fun—loving guy that you wanted to be around. There was a kind of, um... charming kind of boyishness to him, the humility. Tremendous heart, yes... A caring individual and just... HE SIGHS Man, as I said, I'm so happy that he was... part of my lifetime. If you look at Roberto Duran, you look at the heights and the depths of his career. You even look at No Mas. Ask yourself who in their lives has not had a "no mas" moment? ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH: LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC PLAYS
