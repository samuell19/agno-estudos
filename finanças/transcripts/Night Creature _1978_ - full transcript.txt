(suspenseful music) (light, mellow music) (Oriental music) - [Narrator] Bangkok, Thailand, Pulitzer Prize winning novelist, Axel MacGregor, who now makes his home on an island in the River Kwai, has announced that he will postpone his restoration work on a number of Buddhist temples there long enough to hunt the man-eating black leopard that has been marauding villages in one of the northern provinces. MacGregor has been called a living legend. In his long career, he has been a war correspondent, a test pilot, a professional race car driver, and a big game hunter. Today, the living legend is reputed to be one of the deadliest carnivorous animals on Earth. This cat is said to kill for the simple pleasure of killing, frequently leaving his victim behind as he moves from one village to another, creating a gruesome and frightening legend of his own. The natives in that region have come to believe that this man eater is possessed of supernatural powers, but MacGregor doesn't appear to share that view. He says that he looks forward to the hunt with confidence and enthusiasm. (tense, scary music) (leopard growling softly) (tense music) (leopard growling softly) (tense music) (leopard growling softly) (tense music) (leopard growling fiercely) (gunshots blasting) (boat motor humming) - Welcome home. - Thank you, it's good to be back. (speaking foreign language) - Ah, it's all right, I'll eat something later. - The leg hurt? - The damn leg is stiff, but all I need is some peace and quiet. Here Zachia, I want to give everybody two weeks holiday with full pay, tell 'em I'm all right, not to worry. I just want to be alone. You take off too, everyone is to leave tonight, okay? (deep, suspenseful music) (light orchestral music) (serious orchestral music) (tense, somber orchestral music) - [Narrator] And now, a bounty has been placed on the beast's head, offered by the very man who was almost killed by the same animal two weeks ago. Axel MacGregor has offered $10,000 for the capture of this cat. As a result, numerous bands of professional Thai hunting parties have embarked on a series of extremely dangerous expeditions. The reward however, is delivered only if the beast is captured alive. What MacGregor intends doing with this most dangerous and cunning killer is not known at this moment. But we can only assume he will present it to the Royal Zoo of Bangkok.

Well you know what they say folks, great men come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Now straight ahead if you look out of the bus is a statue of King Rama V, he believed that all men were born to live in freedom, not slavery. Might be ole Abe Lincoln and King Rama had the same school teacher. By the way people, the English translation of Thai means freedom. Oop, now on the left here a little, yeah, right out of the left of the bus you can see the Grand Palace and the home of the Emerald Buddha, worth millions. Old Buddhists said that men should train their minds and keep 'em broad as the Earth, unlimited as the sky, deep as a big ole Texas river, and soft as well-tanned leather. Well, that about wraps it up folks. Texas Tom's Tours of Thailand. Here we are back at the Siam Hotel safe and sound. On behalf of the crew, Texas Tom, and myself, we'd like to thank you for touring Thailand with us. In fact, tell all the folks back home you found a little Texas in Thailand. Now you please wait till the bus comes to a complete stop. Now you remember what we always say (speaking foreign language) y'all come back again real soon. - Oh it's been wonderful, thank you ever so much, for everything. - See you later. Sure. - Come on, Sherman. - [Ross] Show it to us, Shirley. - Could you give me the name of your tailor? - Houston Hong, he's in the lobby, he'll give you 10% off. - Thank you. - It's on the back of the brochure there. (people chattering) - Want one, I got it from a kid. - No thanks. - I told mother not to drink so much on the flight, she'll never learn. - She still in the coffee shop? - Nope, bathroom, here's a red one, it sticks to your teeth. - It's a yellow one. Hey Peggy, wouldn't that be him? - Yeah, it is. - I'll go get Georgia, you watch the bags, okay? - [Peggy] Want one? - [Leslie] Huh-uh, that's enough. - Well, we eat again tonight. - What that mean? - That mean business is great. Listen, have we got enough gas? - Oh yeah, sure. - All right, I'm gonna go look for 'em. - Okay. - I swear you know, you can't taste the vodka with all those spices they put in it. - I was getting worried about you. - I'll be all right, I've got some aspirin somewhere. Where's Peggy? - Looking after the luggage. Look, is that him there, in the straw hat? - Oh my god, Ross, Ross! - [Ross] Hey, babe! - Hi baby, oh! You look great. Oh Ross, I've got such a headache, I must look terrible. - [Ross] You look fine. - You know we should've had you pick us up at the airport. My god, I thought we'd never get here. Oh darling, this is my sister, Leslie. - [Ross] Hi. - Hello. - Different mama, same papa. Leslie this is Ross, the one with the tours. Oh darling, what's the name of your company? - Texas Tom's Terrific Tours of Thailand. - Hi Ross, when do we go? - Hi Peg, come on, let's go now and see if we can beat the traffic. Tom, that's his name, how would Texas Ross sound? Besides, it makes the tourists feel right at home. We also sell hotdogs, hamburgers, and Cokes. Watch your step, all imported from the States. How's Axel feeling? - God only knows, I can't get a word out of anybody except that he's all right and he doesn't wanna be bothered. Ross, could you get me a cold beer for medicinal purposes? Thanks, darling. So anyway, I call Leslie, and we decided to come on anyway. - Aunt Leslie, what are you thinking about? - I'm glad we beat the rush hour. (Peggy laughing) How much I love you and how lucky we are that Grandpa Axel is still alive, know what I mean? - Why does Grandpa Axel hunt animals? - Who knows? - You want one? - Okay. (children talking excitedly) - Look, look! I want one, stop the bus. - Peggy, what are you doing? Mother's not well. - Tom, come on, hurry up, stop, pull over. (children talking excitedly) - Take it easy, take it easy. Let her in, let her in. Wait, wait, get off, how much, how much is it? How much? (laughing) You want this one, this one? - How much is it? - [Peggy] Yes, yes. - How much, 10 bucks? Okay, 10 bucks. - 10 bucks. (speaking foreign language) - Bye-bye, let's go. (suspenseful, tense music) (boat motor whirring) - Hi, hi, hey, hello MacGregor. (laughing) Here. Yep, yep, yep. (speaking foreign language) Out, out of the way. (speaking foreign language) - Number one, number one, good shape. - [Axel] Yes, yes. - Still good shape. - [Axel] Good. - Plenty angry, costs more than I thought. - [Axel] How much more, you old crook? - (laughing) 400. - [Axel] All right, but only because you saved my life. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) - Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. (speaking foreign language) Out, out of the way. (speaking foreign language) Okay. (boat motor whirring) (solemn music) (leopard growling) (tense music) - [Axel Voiceover] Look at me, look at me. That's the way I want it. To look in your eyes again. Yes, yes. Just you and me on my island. You understand? (leopard growling) You thought I'd let it go. Did you think I'd let it rest? You made a coward of me. You made me afraid for the first time in my life, and I don't like it. If I can kill you, perhaps I'll be all right. Look at me. There's no way off this island for either of us. You understand? I could kill you now, but it's my game. I make the rules. Only one bullet for each of your nine lives. And if I miss, you're eager for my little game, aren't you? Well, it's time. (deep, tense music) (leopard growling) (tense music) (leopard growling) (tense music) (water lapping) - [Peggy] Hey Ross, look at all these neat things. - So what do you think of him? - Who? Ross? - [Georgia] Mm-hm. - He's nice, a little weird. - He's an animal, take it from me. Oh wow, how do you think this color would look on me? - Gorgeous. (speaking foreign language) - Ah, too much. Oh I can't wait to get out of these clothes and take a shower. (speaking foreign language) - Couldn't decide what to buy Grandpa Axel so maybe I should just give him a great big kiss. - He's going to be surprised just to see us. - Boat's waiting, you ladies ready? You know what I was thinking, Georgia, I oughta buy one of those islands like Axel and turn it into a big lodge. Get some of those big fish from Bangkok to join it, promote the hell out of it, watch your step there. What do you think about that, massage parlor, ouch. There you are, ladies. - Aren't you gonna go with us? - I'd like to honey, but I got a tour ride tomorrow at noon. - Oh please, it's all right, isn't it, Mother? - Now why didn't I think of that? We can talk about old times. Come on, we'll get you back in time. You too, Tom. - [Tom] No thanks, you go, I stay in Nuanchan, go see friend who is dancer. - All right, but you stay out of trouble. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Oh, what that mean? (laughing) - Tom, grab my bag out of the bus. - [Tom] Okay. - Hurry up, my man. (suspenseful music) (gunshot blasting) (bouncy flute music) (curious orchestral music) - [Peggy] Socrates, wait for me. - [Ross] You ever been here before? - No, I've never been here before. Father bought this place about six years ago, and it's that long since I've seen him. - [Ross] Here, let me carry that. - [Leslie] I can manage, thanks. - Oh Ross dear, would you mind? (sighing) All this heat is one thing I'm sure I'm never going to get used to. You know I really love this place. Just wait till you see what Axel's done with it. You know Leslie's an antique nut. She's going to go crazy when she sees all the things that Axel's collected. - Socrates! (Socrates barking) (tense music) (Socrates barking) Socrates! - [Ross] I don't understand why ole Axel never built a boat dock in one of those klongs right near the house. This place'd be terrible for the tourists, it's too far to walk. He oughta make it more like one of those jungle tours in Disneyland, with all those little boats running around. - Surprise! - [Ross] Drop you off right next to the house. - [Georgia] Axel, we're here. - [Peggy] Come on Ross, let's go look for Socrates. (bell ringing) - [Ross] All right, okay babe, let's go. - Where the hell are the servants, hello? Hello? (birds chirping) Axel? This is his study. - I like it. - Well, wherever they are, they'll be back soon. I need a drink. Now where did Ross go to? Well, nevermind, I'll show you your room. Father had a room prepared for you, just in case you ever decided to visit. Just wait till you see this place, each room is like a little house to itself. It's kind of like a tinker toy set, he just added a piece at a time. Can you manage? - [Leslie] Sure. - You know, it's funny we didn't see anybody working on the ruins. I wonder if Axel's given up the project. Uh, am I thirsty. Okay, this is your room right over here, right across from mine. And this is the living room. You know, I think it's hard to tell with this place it's so big you could get lost. Not bad, huh? - Not bad, it's beautiful. - (giggling) Excuse me, I gotta go. You know what I cannot understand is why they don't have johns on those tour buses. Hey, maybe I'll take Ross to Monte Carlo with me. He's such a riot, and Peggy adores him. Besides, I don't like traveling alone. Leslie, are you there? - [Leslie] I'm here. - You should've been with me in Paris. I met some old friends from my modeling days. They took me around the flea markets. We had the most fantastic bouillabaisse at a place called uh, let's see what was it? Oh Tatora, that was it. We really had a great time. You know, I can't believe how long it's been since we've seen each other. - Georgia, come sit down. How are you? - What? - I said, how are you? - Oh, that. I'm fine Leslie, just fine. It's as simple as that. - I didn't mean to pry, I'm just interested. - Wait, it's okay. Listen, life goes on. Here I am after four marriages, in my prime I might add. Trying to raise a kid and be the good mother I was never meant to be. (chuckling) And right now I'm going to have a marvelous bath and a lovely martini, and change into something devastating for Tex. (chuckling) - Georgia. Mm, it's good to see you, I missed you. - I missed you too, I'll see you soon. - Okay. (birds chirping) (Socrates barking) (tense music) - Socrates, Socrates, come here. Socrates. Socrates. (Socrates barking) (barking intensifies) - Do you mind? - No, is that a hobby of yours? - What, you never heard of Leslie MacGregor, the famous fashion photographer? - Ah, another famous person. No, but then I don't read fashion magazines. - Oh, I do other kinds of photography too. I've even been known to do serious work. - What's that mean? Good one? - Well, you're a pretty good subject, basically. Can we take some more? - My pleasure. - What do you think of my father? - Well I've read most of his books. You know, I even tried out a character from one once. Remember Macombo Mike, playboy pet of the idle rich? That's when I first met Georgia. You ever read that one? - I know you haven't always run tour buses in Bangkok. - No, I was a school teacher who became a student. Now what do you think of your father? - I think he's an antisocial misfit. Lovable, and with great charm. If he hadn't been such a gifted writer he might've been an assassin. - I won't tell him you said that. (yelling) (laughing) - [Leslie] Do you ever take anything seriously? - You're full of questions, aren't ya? - You like to talk a lot, don't you? - It's part of the tour. You? - I'm the quiet type. How do you manage to stay happy all the time, or is that just a facade? - I quit reading the newspapers. It's like an endless cartoon strip and we're all part of it. - I know what you mean, we're crazy. - It helps. - [Georgia] Hello everybody. - My, you look pretty. - [Georgia] Thank you, you two seem to be enjoying each other, what's so funny? - Just bein' silly. - [Georgia] (chuckling) Has anybody seen Axel? - Not a sign. - Well I'm hungry, is anybody else? - I'll go fix us something to eat. - Oh that's great. Oh, and see if you can find some wine, okay? - [Leslie] Okay. - It's amazing the way you make friends so easily. - I like your sister, she's a nice person. - I can see that. How would you like to come to Monte Carlo with me? - I don't think so, babe. - I see. Well, I guess I can't say that you don't know what you're missing out on, can I? (laughing) Oh that Leslie, she always has been the strong, independent, mysterious type. What're you doing? - I'm trying to loosen up, work up a little appetite. - Well, I guess it's going to rain any minute. Have you-- - Rain, shine, it's the same all the time. - Have you seen Peggy? - About a half hour ago, looking for Socrates. - I'll see you later. (exhaling) (suspenseful music) (leopard growling) (mysterious music) - Socrates! Socrates! (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) - If she doesn't show up in five minutes, I'm going to go look for her. - She probably took shelter in a hideout when it started to rain. - Don't worry, Georgia, I'm sure she's all right. - Look, I know everybody is trying not to worry, but I can't help it. This whole thing is awfully damn strange. Axel is gone, the servants are gone. Where are the men that are suppose to be working on the ruins? Now Peggy. - Knowing father, there's probably an illogical explanation. - Look, I'll get a flashlight and go look for her. - Mommy! - Oh Peggy, for sakes you had me worried sick. - I can't find Socrates! - All right, just relax. He can't get off the island without a boat, you know. - [Ross] He's probably out looking for you, Princess. - You surely don't think you're going to find him in the dark, do you? Come on, let's get you out of these wet clothes. - It's funny to see Georgia behaving like a mother hen. It's usually Peggy that's looking after her. - Yeah, I guess it's not easy to raise a kid by yourself. - No. - You ever been married? - No, you? - Almost. Except I never met a woman who knew how to love without trying to turn it into some kind of security trap. Punch in at eight, out at five, make love on a time schedule. Stay put, don't take any chances. - Really, that's funny. I never met a man who knew how to love without turning it into a slave-master relationship. Don't think, don't act independently, just be a pretty ornament. Stay ready to provide connubial bliss for his majesty, whether you feel like it or not. Stand by his side, slightly to the rear. And applaud and coo every time he makes another deal. - Now what kind of woman would want a marriage like that? - The kind of woman you've been used to. They're made for each other, Miss Security, goddess, Mr. Macho, stud, it's another cartoon. - They deserve each other. - I suppose so. (sighing) (laughing) Georgia wants to take you to Monte Carlo. - I'm not going. - I'm glad. - Why? - Because. (gentle music) - Why don't I fix you something to eat, huh? - I'm not hungry. - I'll bet you that Socrates is right here in this house. You know this place has got a lot of rooms. - No, I heard him barking out in the woods. - He'll be back. - Mommy, can't we please go out and look for him? It stopped raining. - It's dark out there. - You scared? - Course not, it's just silly. I mean, you can't see anything out there. - Please. - You know, you're a very pushy kid. I don't know who you get that from. Come on, we'll turn on the floodlights. (solemn music) (wind howling) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (wind howling) - Mother, this stuff stinks. - I don't care. If I have to go hiking through a tropical jungle in the middle of the night, I refuse to come back looking like a giant mosquito bite. This isn't exactly Park Avenue, you know. Leslie! Leslie! - [Leslie] What? - We're going out to look for that dumb dog. - He's not dumb. - We'll be back in a minute. - Don't fall in the klong. - [Peggy] Don't worry, I'll take care of her. - Well I never. Let's hurry up before it starts raining again. Hey, wait for me. (Peggy giggling) (laughing) Come on you. (suspenseful music) I can't believe I'm doing this. Why don't you sing something. - [Peggy] What for? - I don't know, it's too quiet. - [Peggy] Socrates! - [Georgia] Shh. - [Peggy] I thought you said it was too quiet. - [Georgia] Don't be a smart kid. Come on, sing something. ♪ The boogie man'll get you if you don't watch out ♪ ♪ The boogie man will bite you with his very big snout ♪ - That's very funny, you're a real sadist aren't you? - [Peggy] Socrates! - Socrates! - [Peggy] Socrates! (scary music) - Peggy, run. Run! (tense music) (gasping and shuttering) (leopard growling) (gasping and moaning) (tense music) (screaming) (leopard growling fiercely) (Georgia screaming) (gasping) Oh my god. (crying and whimpering) No! (yelling) (tense music) (Georgia yelling) (breathing heavily) (leopard growling) Please, please no! (Georgia groaning) (Georgia screaming) (leopard growling) No! No, god! Oh my god, oh my god! (yelling) (leopard growling) Oh no! (moaning) (tense music) (Georgia moaning) (leopard growling softly) (somber music) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) (leopard growling softly) (Georgia shuttering and crying) (leopard growling softly) (Georgia whimpering) (leopard growling fiercely) (leopard growling distantly) (thunder clapping) - [Axel] Oh my god. Oh. Oh. (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) (thunder rumbling) Leslie. - Listen. (rain splattering) (thunder clapping) - [Ross] Axel, what happened? Leslie, hurry up. Axel, over here, here, set her down. Where's Peggy? I'll go look for her. (crying) - Oh no, no, no. (thunder clapping) - Killed my baby. I swear to God, Leslie, I didn't, I didn't mean it to happen. - Georgia. - I didn't mean it to happen. It wasn't, it wasn't my fault. - No. - I, I, I thought, - Georgia. - I thought I was alone. I, I (crying) where did you come from? Where the hell did you come from? Where the hell did you all come from? (crying) (solemn music) (rain splattering) (tense music) (thunder clapping) (rain splattering) - Why father, why, why did you bring the animal here? - I'm sorry I can't explain. I wanted, I wanted to be alone with it. - [Leslie] Tell me Father, I want to know. - Not now, Leslie. You wouldn't understand. - I understand you, Father. All my life I've understood you, only you never knew it. You kept us away because you didn't want anyone to know you. You brought the cat here because you didn't want to have to face the truth. If you killed the cat, then you could patch up the old myth. Axel MacGregor, the living legend. If the cat kills you, you're out of your misery. You believed your own press. You thought you could choose your own time and place to die and you would go out in a blaze of glory. But when the moment of truth came, you fell apart. Is that what it was like, Father? When the cat attacked you, were you the hero you thought you were? Did you think you were alone? Didn't you know how much we loved you? Did you think it really mattered whether you were a hero or not? Oh Father, I'm so sorry for you. (crying) - No need. (crying) - You didn't hear a word I said. (crying) (deep, somber music) (rain splattering) (footsteps clicking) (rain splattering) (mysterious music) (thunder clapping) (rain splattering) - Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! Peggy! (leopard growling) Peggy. (suspenseful music) Peggy! (gunshot blasting) - I'm sure that was a gunshot. Father! - [Ross] I'll check the steps. (solemn, tense music) (gunshots blasting) (solemn, tense music) (gunshots blasting) (suspenseful music) (leopard growling) (gunshot blasting) (leopard growling) (suspenseful music) (leopard growling) (leopard growling fiercely) - Grandpa. - Peggy, Peggy my love, go back where you were. Quickly, you're safe there, he won't cross the bridge. We'll come for you. (leopard growling) (tense music) (adventurous music) (tense music) (birds chirping) Peggy's all right. - I'd rather swim than walk, cats don't like water. I'll get a hunting party and come back before dark. - You'll have only about 30 yards from the klong to the dock. - I feel like I'm playing Macombo Mike again. - Good luck. (rain splattering) (tense music) Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy. - You didn't sleep at all last night, did you? - I don't remember. - I said things last night I-- - You said what needed saying. - Will you tell me something? - Probably. - What was it like, standing out there, facing the cat with an empty rifle? - It was like being out of fuel 10,000 feet up and nowhere to land. It's like your mother telling me she was leaving me, and my daring her to go. It's like being deep, deep in the ocean, coming up slowly, slowly, alone. Sound of your breath and no air to breathe. (rain splattering) (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) (mysterious music) (leopard growling) (leopard growling fiercely) (glass shattering) - Oh, oh. (laughing) Ah, oh, oh, oh. (water lapping) (tense music) - What happened? - He tried to get in, I scalded it. - Good, maybe that'll keep him away for awhile. Boat's gone. Ah, the storm washed it away. - Oh no. - Thank you. I feel so helpless. We've gotta figure out how to get to that baby. - [Leslie] Nothing to do now but wait. Poor Peggy. - Did you find anymore ammunition? - No, it's all gone. - Well, someone's bound to show up. - Maybe. (thunder clapping) (tense, suspenseful music) (light Oriental music) (serious music) - [Axel] Ross. - Boat's gone, rain washed it away. - Oh my god. I had a strange dream. I suddenly feel very old and tired and stupid. - I know what you mean. - Christ, what a funny dream. I don't know what to make of it. It was raining. (both laughing) I don't know how to describe it except that I was a temple, but I was in ruins, like these temples out here. The rain was washing me away, I was crumbling. Leslie's a strong woman, we've never been very close. Georgia always wanted to be like Leslie and I suppose I wanted her to be. Then again in another way, I didn't. I enjoyed her dependence on me. She was a very precious possession. If I had my time again I, I'd let her loose. - What's wrong with now? - Letting go's not a thing I've ever been very good at. I want to possess, to dominate. I'm afraid of letting go, afraid. Leslie's right, I am afraid. - Sometimes you have to reach out to people Axel, share your pain, you're not alone unless you wanna be. - And you, are you afraid? - Right now (laughing) hell yes, I'm afraid. That animal out there doesn't laugh at my jokes. He doesn't give a damn how important I think I am. Yeah, I'm afraid, maybe that's what makes us human. Listen, how do we get off this damned island? (suspenseful music) - Yeah, Ross! - Tom, run, run! Hurry, get in here, faster, there's a leopard up there. - Hurry up man, she's not kidding, hurry up. (leopard growling) (scary music) (leopard growling fiercely) (Tom yelling) - No! (Tom yelling and moaning) (leopard growling) (tense music) We got ourselves in a cage here man, a cage! - My god, oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god. Listen if, if only we could reverse the situation. If we could get, if we could get the cat in here and ourselves out there. I, we've got to get, we've got to get that child. (somber music) Oh my god. (thunder rumbling) (rain splattering) Funny, how one day can seem like an eternity. We've gotta get to her. - Maybe we should try something else. I mean, what if we do get him in the compound? Our only hope is to delay him a few minutes. And he's bound to get out anyway. - Leslie, Axel, the rain stopped. - He probably won't come in anyway, he'll be too suspicious. - No, that's the astonishing things about leopards, they're totally unpredictable. You never know what they're going to do next. If it seems like a stupid thing to come into a man's house, that's probably exactly what he'll do. They're cunning, they watch your eyes, waiting for you to blink. And the moment you blink, they hit you. (laughing) I suddenly realized something. (laughing) Look at me, here I am, a grown up human being, the famous Axel MacGregor (laughing) reduced to cat bait. (both laughing) What an idiot I am. Why did I ever bring that animal here? Silly, aren't I? Isn't it the craziest thing you've ever seen, cat bait. (both laughing) - That cat man, he's not gonna come in here, he's probably out taking a cat nap someplace. (all laughing) - This is some kind of cartoon nightmare. Ah! - [Ross] (laughing) What a silly game, nine bullets for nine lives. (Leslie chuckling) - All right, Ross. Get out of the window. I'll try to entertain him for as long as I can. What's the matter? You don't understand this. You can't smell fear, is that it? You're right, I'm not afraid of you. I can look you straight in the face, all right. (leopard growling fiercely) (adventurous orchestral music) (tense music) (leopard growling) (suspenseful music) (leopard growling) (adventurous music) (leopard growling) (tense music) (groaning) (tense music) (leopard growling) (gun blasting) (exploding) (leopard growling) (solemn orchestral music) (gentle orchestral music)
