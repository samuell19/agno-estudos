In 1930, Viennese mathematician K. Gödel shakes the foundations of mathematics with his incompleteness theorems. He proves that every formal-logical system has problems that are not solvable or conclusively determinable. Truth outruns provability. THE NET A film by LUTZ DAMMBECK Working on this film, I chanced upon something quite strange: One of the most spectacular criminal cases in the US. It all started quite harmlessly. I noticed in setting up my new computer that there were a large number of terms already familiar from other contexts: Multimedia, virtuality, boundary-crossings and revolutions of all kinds, which also belonged to the agenda of rebellious artists in the 1960s, who wanted to erase the the boundaries between art and life: "Change now!" Namely, a cocktail mixing revolt, rock, and pop. Fascinating! The message was: "Everything is possible. Reality can be altered at will. You are what you want to be." Strange, the way these two worlds met: computer and art. Why did artists and scientists, in constructing their machines, use apparently similar patterns and concepts? Was there a secret basic pattern and system? My research led me to a publisher in New York. During the 60s, John Brockman is part of the New York multimedia scene centered around John Cage, Jonas Mekas, and Andy Warhol. He becomes rich and famous in the 80s, when multimedia art and new technologies turn into big business. Brockman becomes an agent for books by physicists, genetic researchers and computer scien- tists. He markets them like pop stars. In the 90s, his publishing company is the center of a global network of scientists, artists and media managers, whom he refers to as the "Digerati". A "cyber-elite" that successfully combines multimedia and business. In 1993, John Brockman's network is hit by a bomb attack. The victim is computer scientist David Gelernter. The FBI arrests a former mathematics professor and graduate of Harvard University, Ted Kaczynski, as the perpetrator. Why would a mathematician become a terrorist? John Brockman is my first interview partner. He came to New York in 1963 and began his career as an investment banker. John Brockman's reaction to my question about Ted Kaczynski surprises me. What is this "Manifesto" that he mentioned? Between 1978 and 1995, the USA is shaken by a series of bomb attacks. Three people are killed and 23 are injured, some of them seriously. The bombing targets are major airline executives and scientists at select elite universities. FBI investigators assume the attacks are the work of a single, intelligent person whom they code-name the "Unabomber", a computer abbreviation of the words "universities" and "airlines". In 1996, the New York Times and the Washington Post receive letters in which a previously unknown terror group "FC", or "Freedom Club", claims it will discontinue the attacks when its demand for the publication of a "Manifesto" is met. On August 2, 1995, the FBI sanctions the pre-printing of the 56-page "Manifesto", which leads to the arrest of mathematician Ted Kaczynski. On reading the text, David Kaczynski recognizes quotes from his brother Ted, and at his wife's insistence contacts the FBI. In 1996, the FBI arrests Ted Kaczynski in the wilds of Montana, where he has been living for 25 years in a self-built cabin. My next interview partner is Brockman's friend and client, Stewart Brand. We meet in Sausalito, a former fishing village close to San Francisco. During the 60s, Stewart Brand belongs to the scene of hippies and artists who live in houseboats at the edge of Sausalito. The author Ken Kesey is a central figure in this scene. In 1960, Kesey is one of the student "guinea-pigs" employed to test LSD in a project commissioned by the American government. Then he goes on the road, with musicians and the theater group Merry Pranksters, in order to conduct "Acid Tests" promoting LSD and other drugs that turn consciousness into an "open system"... An alternative form of cybernetics. Stewart Brand was one of those "alternative cyberneticists", and today he still maintains a small office and studio in Sausalito. Brand coined the term "personal computer", and during the 60s he published the "Whole Earth Catalog", a mail-order catalog for the counter-cultural lifestyle. In the 80s, on a houseboat in Sausalito, he sets up the first ever alternative computer network: "The Well". In the 90s, he works as a consultant for the California computer industry. What brings computers, LSD and hippies together? "Industrial Society and Its Future", by "FC"... "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. Continuing scientific and technical progress will destroy the freedom of the individual. Soon there will be no place left where an individual can hide from mind control and surveillance by super computers. It would be hopeless to attack the system without employing modern technology ourselves. We must use all forms of media in order to spread our message: Nature is the opposite of technology and makes a perfect counter-ideal. The sooner this system collapses, the better it will be for mankind." Florence, Colorado. February 28. Dear Mr Dammbeck, thank you for your letter and for your questions, which I shall endeavor to answer. I use this opportunity to improve my knowledge of the German language. I am not a scientist. Thirty years ago, I was a mathematician, but I have now forgotten most of what I knew about mathematics. I believe that "utopias" are crazy and dangerous, in particular those of a technological society. Technology is a totally willful and extremely dangerous force that will lead us where it must inevitably lead us. This will not be determined by chance, nor will it result from the despotism of arrogant bureaucrats or scientists. No, the technological system need merely adapt human behavior to its own demands. This is necessary in order that it can function and continue to extend itself. You asked me some things about the "Manifesto". All the published versions of the "Manifesto" are incorrect. They contain serious mistakes. If you would like a correct version of the "Manifesto", I could send you one. You may continue writing to me in German. How does a utopia emerge? Does it come into being by chance, are there one or more inventors... Or is there a plan? The US and international science and engineering elite are educated at "MIT". MIT also leads the way in the close partnership between the military and the university system. This collaboration begins in World War I and continues during World War Il, when technology becomes a deciding factor in warfare. On August 13, 1940, the German Luftwaffe begins the "Battle of Britain". Shortly after the start of the German attack, mathematician and physicist Norbert Wiener, born in Chicago in 1886, offered his knowledge and expertise in the fight against fascism. Wiener is professor of mathematics at MIT and had already dealt with questions of ballistics and artillery during WW I. How do you construct a machine that can calculate in advance the movement of fighter planes, so that you can shoot them down? Wiener must take into account the nature of technological warfare, in which people, ships and planes are just abstract blips on the radar screen. The pilot becomes one with his plane, the boundary between man and machine becomes blurred, and what emerges is a mechanized opponent whose actions can be calculated in war laboratories. Although Wiener's machines are not operational until after the end of war, he develops from this starting point the model for a new science, known as cybernetics. Cybernetics is concerned with how the transfer of information functions in machines and living beings. The basis of cybernetics is the assumption that the human nervous system does not reproduce reality, but calculates it. Man now appears to be no more than a an information-processing system. Thought is data processing, and the brain is a machine made of flesh. The brain is no longer the place where "ego" and "identity" are mysteriously created through memory and consciousness. It is a machine consisting of switching and controlling units, feedback loops, and communication nodes. A black box where cause is effect and effect is cause within an infinite cycle. A closed feedback system with input and output that can be controlled and calculated, no longer, as previously, starting out from the contemplation of nature, but from indisputable mathematics and logic. Wiener's vision of a future cybernetic society now provides the scientific legitimacy for the new political-military status of the United States as a superpower. Cybernetics becomes the leading new science worldwide, and from that point on continues to develop under diverse labels. A theory becomes worldwide practice. Florence, March 6. As I now have a little more time, I'll continue with my answer to your letter. You ask: "What will a post-technological society look like?" Well, if all modern technology were abolished, we only know that there would be no more biotechnology, no more atomic bombs... Let's stick to the practical and the concrete: Would you like it if people lived in a virtual world? If machines were smarter than people? If, in the future people, animals and plants were products of technology? If you don't like these ideas, then for you the computer and biological sciences clearly are dangerous. This is very simple, and bears no relation to morality or to Gödel's incompleteness theorems or other abstract philosophical issues. You offered to send a gift that would please me. I would like to take you up on that offer. My German dictionary is small, not very good and falling apart. I'd really like to receive a good German-English dictionary. But you are not allowed to send one with a hard cover. To go back to Ted Kaczynski... In 1958, the 16-year-old with an IQ of 170 begins his studies in mathematics at Harvard University. In 1967, he becomes a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley. Why does Ted end up among those opposed to technology, rather than become a fervent computer-hippie like Brand or Brockman? Where does his later fear of computers and psychological control techniques, like those being developed at the time in secret US labs, actually derive from? How do individual computers develop into world-wide computer networks? This is the task that former NASA engineer Robert Taylor is working on at the end of the 60s. Taylor is one of the young engineers and scientists who are so enthusiastic about Wiener's cybernetics and the early computers. The rocket specialist from NASA soon transfers to the Pentagon, where he becomes a scientific manager. There he makes decisions on how much money university laboratories, companies or individual scientists will receive for their research projects. He decides who is going to get in on the action and who isn't. The "Arpanet", which was developed under his direction during the 70s, is the original form of today's Internet and of all communication networks on today's fully electronic battlefield. What do I have thus far? I have a former mathematician, but none of my interview subjects wants to talk about his criticism of the system. And I have engineers and artists who are obsessed with technology. All this is obviously part of a system whose outlines I am only just beginning to grasp. To all appearances, it's a ingenious feedback system that turns every attack and disruption into an energy source with which to perfect itself. Who would need such a thing? Who would come up with something like this? Between 1946 and 1953, at the invitation of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, leading scientists from various fields meet in the New York Beekman Hotel. They include Norbert Wiener, Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, Kurt Lewin, and John von Neumann. The aim of these secret meetings, later known as the "Macy Conferences" and sporadically attended by CIA agents, is to develop a science that makes it possible to control human behavior. This is a weapon that America desperately needs in the Cold War, on the new battlefield of the subconscious. The "Macy Group" therefore registers particular interest in the 1950 study "The Authoritarian Personality", released by the International Institute of Social Research, a new foundation of the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research, centered around Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno. This study is the most comprehensive social profile of a society - the USA. Its aim is to present an explanation for religious and racial prejudice. Thousands of interviews lead to a huge collection of data, which are analyzed by the most up-to-date computers. with the aim of answering one particular question: How does authoritarian behavior as a mass phenomenon develop? The authors see the explanation in man's "authoritarian matrix" which offers the key to the psychology of fascism and totalitarian systems. This matrix is shaped through education and tradition, and it is apparently indissolubly linked to the metaphysical notion of "supra-naturally created nature". How could a tendency towards fascism and racism, especially against Jews, be tracked and explained? Sociologists invent, among other things, a scale to measure fascist potential, the so-called "F-scale". In addition, previously concealed personality tendencies are to be tracked, using the latest psychological processes, for example, tests conceived by the American psychologist Henry A. Murray, one of the fathers of today's assessment centers. In order to permanently obstruct fascism and anti-Semitism, it seems necessary to alter the nature of man and his cultural patterns so that the authoritarian matrix would forever cease to exist. How is it possible, ruling out some bloody operation, to penetrate deep into a person's consciousness with the aim of changing it? First, according to Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin, a member of the Macy Group, the old values and balances must be destroyed, in order to make conditions "fluid". Then it is possible to establish a new balance and values. These, then, must be permanently fixed by means of self-regulation. Re-education will then develop into self-re-education. This would transform the world into a post-national, multi-ethnic society with no fixed borders. The Macy Group believes it can offer the tools and blueprints for this new world order: New and faster computers, system theory and model cybernetic worlds, with which it appears possible to control and direct all scientific, cultural and political spheres. This also promises the programming of "new people", "anti-authoritarian people", made to measure. Florence, March 15. In your last letter you asked me so many questions that I cannot possibly answer them all at once. When I wrote that the concept of a "utopia" is crazy and dangerous, I didn't mean that all utopias are crazy and dangerous, but rather the utopia where it is possible to create a society according to a specific, ideal design. You yourself, I am sure, will have your own idea of utopia. Someone else will have a different idea, which may diverge considerably from yours. How would you like it if he forced his utopia on you? Do you have the right to force your utopia on him? I would like to write more to you in answer to these and other questions, but some serious problems have cropped up, which are causing me a great deal of worry. So I will close this letter here. I'll write more to you later. At places like this in Esalen, a conference and esotericism center on the coast of California, artists meet with members of the Macy Conferences during the 70s. They are interested in a new spirituality, brought about with the help of cybernetics and drugs, and in the popularization of the Macy visions. Besides Brand and Brockman, the partici- pants include gurus of the avant-garde, such as John Cage and Buckminster Fuller. As a result of such meetings, the concept of cybernetics reach the international networks of the bohemian world, and so acquire a different, non-military aura. At one of the meetings in Esalen, Heinz von Foerster, the physicist and philosopher, also takes part. Born in Vienna in 1911, Even as a student, Foerster comes into contact with philosopher Wittgenstein and the scientists of the "Vienna Circle", the early prophets of cybernetics and system theory. In the US, in 1953, Foerster becomes the secretary of the Macy Conferences and so has access to the inner circles of America's scientific elite. Foerster is one of the pioneers of the theory of Constructivism, according to which we human beings construct our own reality. No objective reality exists independent of the observer. During the 60s, Heinz von Foerster is head of his own research laboratory, the "Biological Computer Lab", at the University of Illinois. Here, commissioned by research departments of the US Navy & Air Force, he works on, among other projects, the merging of digital and biological systems. Heinz von Foerster has never owned a computer of his own because he clearly believes that he himself is a better one. ... I came across the Vienna Circle by chance, and the lectures that were held there made a deep impression on me... Yes, that was the last time... ... by chance I encountered a Viennese philosopher... I've got the same blue shirt there, so I'm still the same old Heinz! When I read the "Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus" for the first time, I was really thrilled. Immediately, I could recite the whole Tractatus by heart, but I never found anyone with whom I could discuss it. Only when some philosophical statement or other was made in the family at home, I said: "No, that can't be right! Ludwig Wittgenstein says: Proposition four point five two, this or that, or that is the case!" And my poor parents and relatives said: "What shall we do with the poor boy? He is completely brainwashed by Wittgenstein! Can we find someone who will help him escape from this trap?" But quite the contrary happened: I fell deeper and deeper into the trap. What I see, and what I believe lies beneath your questioning, is that science, or "sciencia" in Latin, has been amazingly successful in the 2,000 years since Aristotle. And what does "sciencia" derive from? The Indo-European word for "sciencia" is the word "scy", and that is found in "science" and "sciencia" and in "schizophrenia", and in "schism", that is the word meaning "to separate". And so "systemics" is a parallel development, only it's the exact opposite of "science", for it integrates. When you think about it today, all this system theory and systems research which crops up in both art and science... I wouldn't call that "science" any more, I would call it "systemics". Today's science has moved on to an approach that sees things together: "systemics". So I would see the steps taken today as being from science to systemics. In the course of my life, the more I concerned myself with physics, I realized that actually I was a "metaphysicist". And then I increasingly played with that idea. And if you ask me: "My dear Heinz von Foerster, what is a metaphysicist?", I would say the following: There are questions among those we ask about the world that it is possible to answer: "Heinz von Foerster, how old are you?" You can look that up in a catalog: Born in 1911, that means he is 90. Or you can ask questions which cannot be answered, like for example: "Heinz von Foerster, what was the origin of the universe?" Well, then I could give you one of the 35 different theories. Ask an astronomer, and he says: "There was this Big Bang about 20 million years ago." Or ask a good Catholic: "Everyone knows that. God created the world, and after seven days he was weary and took a break, and that was Sunday..." So there are different, very interesting hypotheses about the origins of the universe. That is, there are so many different hypotheses because the question cannot be answered. So all that is relevant is how interesting is the story that someone invents to explain the origins of the universe. Of course we are very close to art there... If it's a matter of inventing a good story, a poetic story... Exactly, exactly... That's what it is. There is a struggle between two or three or even ten different poets. Who can invent a funny, amusing or interesting story so that everyone immediately thinks: "That's what must have happened!" But science, and your own research... Those are not just inventions or good stories? Surely they're based on mathematics, on numbers, on provability, on indisputable scientific data? Well, yes, but these days there is already so much data that it is no longer possible to include all the different data in your "story". And then artificial data is invented, for example particles... Then particles are invented that do whatever it is we don't understand. So in my opinion particles are always the solutions to problems that we can't solve any other way. That is, they are inventions that help to explain certain problems. Those are particles. I think I have to ask a dumb question... - I understand, yes... Right, let me explain it a bit better. Let's say there is a hole in my theory, one I can't gloss over. So I just say: Look, here are some new particles, that are either green, yellow or... I don't know what... They replace the hole in my theory. So I maintain that each particle we read about in today's physics is the answer to a question that we can't answer. But that's terrible! How can we let a world-wide, networked system of machines grow, more or less infinitely, if it is based on theories that apparently have holes or are only "good stories", I mean on such shaky foundations? Isn't that dangerous? Well, in this world-wide, functioning system of machines all hypotheses are correct. And of course that's what people want. And why are they correct? Because they can all be derived from other hypotheses and "stories"... But what will it lead to? How does it go on? It goes on deducing indefinitely. - But there have to be limits somewhere? No, not at all, that's the good thing about it. You can go on forever. In logic. - Yes, precisely. - But in reality? Where is reality? Can you show it to me? In 1971, Professor of Mathematics Ted Kaczynski resigns from his position at the University of California at Berkeley and builds himself a cabin in the forests of Montana. Has he taken the vague offer in Stuart Brand's catalog too seriously, of a "different", a "simple life" in harmony with nature? Is he seeking, in a strict self-experiment, true experience and a reality that, within the infinite sphere of mathematics and logic, has dissolved into abstract mathematical structures and formulas? When does this experiment reach its limits and demand to be "stepped up"? When does it "click", when does his flight from mathematics and logic become a flight into paranoia, as the media later assume? Into paranoia like that of his fellow mathematician Kurt Gödel, who, with his "incompleteness theorem" posed one of the questions that cannot be answered, and who also reached a limit beyond which there was only paranoia or truth. On the Internet I find references of secret drug tests carried out by the CIA at Harvard University during the early 1960s. One of the test participants is mathematics student Ted Kaczynski. The director of the experiments is the psychologist Henry A. Murray, co-founder of the Department for Social Relations at Harvard. Florence, March 26. Your idea, that the foundations of science and mathematics have been shaken by Gödel's theorem, is incorrect. All that Gödel's theorem says is that certain problems in mathematics can never be solved. When I was young and naïve, I was afraid that technology would create a completely ordered, regulated, and totally perfect world. Today, I think that such an outcome is unlikely. But the reason for my change of mind was certainly not Gödel's theorem, rather the incalculability of the behavior of complex and open systems. Do you want to live in a world where scientists and super-intelligent machines know and understand everything, and therefore can order and regulate everything? If you don't like the sound of that, why do you complain that science doesn't know everything, and that there are holes in theory? Instead, you should be worrying that science knows too much. I must stop here. Thank you very much for the dictionary. In 1958, Ted Kaczynski, together with 20 other Harvard students, is selected as a test subject for studies on the personality structure of highly-gifted male college students. All students are given a code name. Ted Kaczynski is "LAWFUL". The experiments are directed by psychologist Henry A. Murray, a highly-decorated major of the US Army during World War Il. Murray developed a system of tests to study the leadership qualities of officers for the Department of Psychological Warfare of the OSS, the Office of Strategic service, a precursor to the CIA. The tests take place in the secret station "S", a villa near Washington, D.C., and are intended to show how elite groups behave under psychological pressure. But Murray envisages more important tasks for psychology. Like the authors of the study on "The Authoritarian Personality", who employ his testing methods, Murray sees psychology and the new social sciences as destined to make a contribution to a world that can live in peace and harmony: In a new world order, with world laws, one world police force, and one world government. "The United States", according to Murray, "is the abstraction of ONE WORLD which we are on the verge of creating. The lot has fallen to the US to take over the direction of carrying out this last and difficult experiment: a global campaign of good against evil. By completely dedicating ourselves to the idea of a one world government, we will stir the hearts of all people on earth with the hope of a security that can counter any form of totalitarianism. The 'national individual' is obsolete, and must be transformed into a 'global individual'." To effect this transformation, scientists commissioned by the CIA also employ LSD 25, a new synthetic drug that has been developed by Sandoz, a Swiss company. How can a drug be used to break through a person's subconscious, in order to program it in a new way? At his institute at Harvard, Henry A. Murray is obsessed with the idea of developing a "superego", that will immunize the proposed "global individual" against all forms of totalitarianism. He develops a system of tests that are designed to expose students to extreme psychological stress. The goal of these tests is a complete investigation into personality, so that desirable character patterns may then be created and controlled. At the same time, LSD shows up on the Harvard campus, distributed in the form of sugar cubes. With Murray's approval, Timothy Leary, a young professor of psychology, has established an LSD research project at Harvard, co-directed by the CIA. Together with Leary, Murray participates in drug trips himself. Is he continuing, as reported on the Internet, his earlier OSS experiments, though now for the CIA? These experiments, carried out between 1953 and 1964 under code names such as "MK-Ultra" or "Artichoke", reputedly developed special psychological control techniques and involved scientists at all of America's elite universities. To what end does Murray plan to use the sacred Mexican mushroom, an hallucinogenic mushroom native to Mexico and the model for synthetic LSD? All of Murray's experiments are filmed. Those films, like all the test results on Ted Kaczynski, have disappeared. Florence, April 1. In your last letter you asked me about the mathematician's imagination. You probably assume that mathematicians always imagine something mathematical. But that's not true. Experienced mathematicians seldom think of mathematics. Usually they imagine flowers, sunshine, and birds singing in spring. Perhaps now and then they think about women, but they don't do that very often, for they are pure in heart. How is it, you will ask, that mathematicians don't think of mathematics constantly? I must tell you that mathematicians are not scientists, they are artists. Do you remember that I wrote to you at the beginning that I was not a scientist? Apart from the most elementary mathematics, like arithmetic or high school algebra, the symbols, formulas and words of mathematics have no meaning at all. The entire structure of pure mathematics is a monstrous swindle, simply a game, a thoughtless prank. You may well ask: "Are there no renegades to reveal the truth?" Yes, of course. But the facts are so incredible that no one takes them seriously. So the secret is in no danger. In 1971, Ted Kaczynski becomes a resident of Lincoln, Montana. His neighbors are a sawmill owner, Butch Gehring, and Lincoln's piano teacher, Chris Waits. Butch and his friend Chris help FBI agents during the surveillance and arrest of their neighbor, Ted. On orders of the FBI, Chris searches for and finds a second cabin belonging to Ted: allegedly the secret workshop where he makes bombs. This is important evidence for the FBI's theory: Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber. Florence, April 14. You asked me: "How can a person defend himself against the pressure to contribute to the realization of a utopia? Who gives him the right to use violence against them?" In my opinion, the use of violence, e.g. against the realization of the utopia of a technological society, is mere self-defense. One can argue with that, of course. If you believe it is immoral, then you yourself must avoid the use of violence. But I have one question for you in that context: What kind of violence has caused more harm in the history of mankind: the violence that was sanctioned by the state, or the violence that was used, without sanction, by individuals? I'll go into the other questions you asked later. Until then I have other work to do. In 1993, the computer scientist David Gelernter receives a letter bomb. He loses an eye and his right hand in the explosion. David Gelernter is professor of computer science at Yale University and leading scientist at "Mirror Worlds", a company that produces software for e-commerce and for the new information technologies. "Mirror Worlds" is also the title of the book that made Gelernter famous: depicting the vision of a future virtual society based only on software. Gelernter is a sharp critic of the American media, which he accuses of destroying the country's moral value system with their lust for sex, blood and violence. Florence, May 2. Dear Mr Dammbeck, I shall now continue my answer to your letters. You asked: "Who is entitled to establish the law?" I maintain that no one is entitled to do so. In civilized societies, we usually say that the state establishes the laws. In non-civilized societies, customs and habits establish the law. If people reject the standards of law laid down by the state and/or customs, and actively fight against it, that is known as "revolution". Of course, no one gives us the right to that. If you believe it is immoral, you must avoid participating in any revolution. But revolution is the only means by which people can resist the technological system. You asked me why I haven't sent you a copy of the authentic version of the "Manifesto" yet. But I don't have an authentic version. I have two photocopies of the original manuscript, but they are illegible in part. I have two very legible transcripts of the "Manifesto", but both contain mistakes. I am in the process of producing an authentic version of the "Manifesto" by comparing the four versions I mentioned, but I don't have the time to finish the job... Because I have to answer so many letters! So I'd rather you didn't ask me so many questions. My biography is unimportant, and I don't want to talk about it. Let us talk about matters that are important. Respectfully yours, Ted Kaczynski. The mathematician Kurt Gödel died in 1978 as a consequence of his paranoia. The mathematician Ted Kaczynski is sentenced to life imprisonment in 1998. Against his wishes, an agreement is made among the defense, the state prosecutor, and the court before the trial even begins: no regular trial, no being committed to a psychiatric unit, no death sentence and no possibility of parole. To this day, Ted Kaczynski continues to deny that he was the "Unabomber". Subtitles Frank Sahlberger Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG Yes, but there have to be limits somewhere? No, not at all, that's the good thing about it. You can go on forever. In logic. - Yes, precisely! - But in reality? Where is reality? Can you show it to me?
