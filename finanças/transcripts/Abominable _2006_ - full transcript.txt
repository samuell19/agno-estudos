What? What is it? Probably them damn coyotes. You're not going out there. You see anything? No. God damn it. Come on, Sparky! Come on! Billy! Billy, wait! Wait for me! Oh, my God. Ethel... This ain't no coyote. Bear? No. This is a 1200 pound quarter horse. I've never seen a bear eat... Sparky! No! Get back here! Sparky! Sparky? Ethel. Back... away... Real slow. Run! Now! Billy! What was that thing out there, Billy? Boy, I don't know. What is that thing? Has it gone? Give me the light. What the hell is that? Come on. Woo! Much better! What are you doing? Get this show on the road. I was listening to that. What say we lay a few ground rules right now, Preston. Dr. Rainer released you into my care. That means I'm going to be calling the shots from here on out. The way I see it... We're going to spend the next three days up here together. Now, we can spend those three days the easy way... Or the hard way. Do we understand each other? This is a bad idea. I don't want to be here. Dr. Rainer seems to think it'll be good for you. It's just going to remind me... Of her. Are you telling me you're not ready for this? Something like that. Ah! You'll be fine! Hey... Earth to Preston! Hey.. You don't want to talk? That's fine. Good afternoon. Hey. Is that it? You up for the weekend? That's right. We don't get many tourists up here this time of year. Of course, you're not a tourist, are you? No sir. I'm up here with Preston Rogers. I'm bringing him home. Preston Rogers? No shit. No. Got him in the car outside. How's he doing? He has his good days. Boy, that was an ugly mess. Real ugly. His wife was nice. She was real nice. She wasn't a bad looking lady, either.. If you know what I mean. You know what they say? They say she died before she hit the ground. Heart attack. In mid-air. Hey.. I want to show you something. It happened right up there. Suicide Rock. Not many people go up there nowadays, I can tell you that. Not since the accident. So.. This is where the rich folk live. This is it right here. Not bad, Preston. Not bad. Alright. Last stop. Everybody out. Otis... I don't want to do this. You'll be just fine, Preston. Let's get you situated. Everything seems to be in good order. A few cobwebs. Nothing we can't handle. Here we are, Preston. Home Sweet Home. Alright, Otis, you can cut the sunshine act. Well.. Might as well get the rest of our stuff. Hey, Charlie. It's me. No. I'm up here at the cabin. Just got here. Well, it's a... Fine. I'm fine. Charlie, if Radcliff calls about that conference, just tell him... No, no. Just tell him... No, Charlie.. Just tell him anything. Just make something up. I'm still struggling to... Preston. Charlie, hold on a second. Yeah? Can't make your shake. Unless you want regular milk. You didn't bring the soy milk? Regular milk's not going to kill you, Preston. Otis, I'm allergic. Alright.. I'll go back into town and buy you some. No. Hold on. Charlie, I'm going to have to call you back. No. I'll call you back. Otis, I'm sorry. You don't have to go back into town. Don't worry about it. Thirty minutes. No! Look Otis, I'd rather not be alone right now. Thirty minutes, Mr Rogers. You'll be just fine. Alright, Girls. So much for peace and quiet. Alright, alright. Come on. That was so awful. Hey, guys? Yeah? I've got a headache. I think I'm gonna hurl. I'ts just the altitude.. You'll be better in a couple of hours. I think a Margarita is the cure, Amanda. Wow.. Have you seen this view? Crazy. Karen. Check this out. Hurdberger! I just want to see if he called. Hurdberger, get off the phone, now! No phones! We said no phones! You promised! Is this wedding going to be like, white everywhere? You're gonna wear white? What's wrong with white? Yes, I'm wearing white. You weren't with us in elementary school. Usually in junior high... Bobby Thomas behind the locker?! It's the 21st century. I can wear white. I don't know why... Wait, wait, wait... Let's not give her a hard time. Okay, this is the first one of us to fall. Congratulations. Ball and chain, Baby. Jeez Otis, where the hell are you? What the hell? How in the world did that happen? Wonderful. I cannot believe you didn't hear that. It was like a loud boom. Like something fell. Like a tree. Like something big fell. It was probably an earthquake. No, it was not an earthquake. It was like a "Bam!" Karen, did you hear it? What are you doing? I'm phoning Bart. Why don't you use the phone inside? I can't. It doesn't work. Yes it does. I called my Mom when we got here. Seriously.. It's not working now. I'm getting shitty reception on this cell phone. Whatever. It's hopeless. Let us know if you hear anything. Bart? Are you there? Hey, it's me. Can you hear me? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on one second. I'm getting really bad reception up here. Hold on. Can you hear me now? Are you there? Oh... Cool... Okay Good? Cool. Hey... I miss you so much. What are you doing? Oh, I'm just hanging out up here in the mountains where there is absolutely nothing to do. Yeah, she's having fun. I miss you so much. Come on, Preston. You're imagining things. Hello?! Anybody there?! Hello?! Can you hear me?! What are you looking at, you perv?! No! No! Wait! Hello! There is something out there. You're not crazy, Preston. You're not crazy. No shit. You are talking to yourself. Shit. Oh, shit. Alright.. Think, Preston, think. You've got no phone. My name is Preston Rogers. I live at 10953 Half Circle Drive. Oh, shit. Thank God. Jesus Christ, Preston.. You scared the shit out of me. I... I didn't... I didn't hear you come in. What are you doing sitting here in the dark, anyways? Are you nuts? Listen, Otis... There's something out there. What? Outside.. I saw it. Saw what? Otis, I saw these eyes... These huge red eyes. Preston, I was just out there. There's nothing out there. You probably saw an owl or something. No, no, no. It wasn't an owl. It was... Where have you been? I had trouble finding the soy milk. My God. My heart won't stop pounding. Let me get you that drink. I saw these eyes. These horrible eyes. There's something in those woods. Uh huh. I think it took one of those girls. You say something about girls, Preston? Yeah. Next door. There's five girls. I mean.. There's only four now. Whatever, Preston. I think we should go over there and tell those girls what I saw. Maybe we should call the police. What's that about police? No. Otis, haven't you been listening to me? One of those girls is missing. I think she was abducted. Okay. What did you see? Well... Did you actually see anyone, Preston? I saw the trees move. You saw the trees move. Look, Otis, I see how this is starting to sound but I am just telling you, you have got to believe me. Well, did you hear her scream or cry out? No.. Not exactly. So, you didn't see anyone and you didn't hear anythng. Otis, you're not listening to me. Preston, did you take your medicine? Forget the damn meds! I'm just asking you to go over there and tell them what I saw! Okay.. You're upset. That's right.. I'm upset. I'm upset but I'm not crazy. I know what I saw, Goddammit! Preston... Relax. Your psyche is very vulnerable right now. Do you understand? I'm fine. I wouldn't want you to do anything that's going to overstimulate you. What are you doing? It's for your own good, Preston. Otis, you're not listening to me. Somebody has to go over there and tell those girls that their friend is missing! Now... Here's what we're gonna do. I'm going to go in there and I'm going to fix us some dinner. And then after... After we're done eating... If she hasn't returned... I'll go over there.. Okay? Okay?! Okay. Fuck that. Hey.. You want a marshmallow? Billy, will you sit the hell down? You're making me nervous, now. Me too. How the hell can you be so still when we got that thing out there killing our livestock? And why did you bring Buddy Boy here with you? Look, we've been going in circles for hours. Can you lead us to this bullshit monster, or not? Hey.. I have the map. Now, a local Indian legend tells of a wild man living in these woods. My grandpa saw it once. He says it only comes out after dark. Now, my question to y'all is: Are you sure you want to find it? Some things are better left unfound. This coming from a guy who chain smokes at his gas station hooked up to an oxygen bottle. Thank you for the reminder. I believe I will. I bet your lungs look like a couple of old saddle bags. Well... Giddyup. Guess you never heard of the Darwin Awards. The what? The Darwin Awards. They give them out to people who died doing the stupidest shit. Like what? One of my favorites was this guy who goes to a petting zoo with some of his friends and he decides to demonstrate the effect of this Crazy Glue. Crazy Glue? Yeah, you know that shit.. He squirts it on both of this hands and then he leans over this fence and he slaps both hands onto the rear end of a rhinoceros. You are kidding. No, no.. I'm not kidding you! No shit.. This thing takes off yanking this guy right off his feet, and all he can smell is ass. And unbeknownst to him, this rhinoceros has been constipated for a couple weeks so they gave him a massive dose of this laxative. The Zookeepper? Yeah. So this thing is charging around trying to free himself of this guy and he's stomping on pygmy goats and ducks and all this stuff and he starts shitting uncontrollably right in this guy's face. The paramedics come. They try to clear an air passage and this guy's buried under 30 gallons of diarrhea, Man. What a dumb ass. Come on! May God strike him dead if I'm lying. You don't believe me, Mr Skeptic? Take a good look in the mirror. You're sitting out here roasting marshmallows looking for Sasquatch. Oh, you don't believe in 'Squatch? Hell, no. Then what the hell are you doin' here? I like to kill shit. I sorta figured. Oh boy. Shhh! Quiet. You be quiet. No. Now, quiet. You shut up. I said quiet, dammit. I heard somethin'. You smell that? Boys... We're not alone. Of course not. We're sitting in the middle of the woods, Sherlock. Ten bucks it's a bear. Ziegler, wait! Another Darwin Award... Comin' up. Hello!! Hello!! Hello?! Are you hurt?! Oh, Jesus! Help me. I'm sorry. Help me. I'm sorry, Sweetheart, you scared the crap out of me. Oh, wow.. That is gross. I've got to find some help. Don't leave me. It's coming back. Don't worry, Sweetheart. No.. Shhh! Please, please don't leave me. Listen.. You're safe now. Please.. He'll be back for me. Don't worry.. Don't worry. No! Please don't... It's alright, Sweetheart. I'll be back in a jiffy, okay? God dammit! You've got to be shittin' me! Shit! You saw it?! It's coming! Yeah, I saw it! Jesus Christ! You satisfied?! Hoss!! Ziegler!! Hoss!! Okay! You smelly Son of a Bitch! You win! Look, I'm gonna leave now! We'll pretend this never happened, alright?! Right! Phone. Of course, that's it. Alright, come on, come on. What was her last name? Oh, come on.. Hurd... Hurd something. Hurdberger. What do I say? Your friend is missing. Your friend... Was taken into the forest. Get police. Sounds so stupid. Come on, Girls. Come on, come on. Damn it! Karen! Karen! What's going on? I heard a cell phone beeping out here, and I don't know where Karen is. You know, I think it's coming from down there. Let's go and check it out. Karen! Karen! Karen! Hello?! Karen! Hey, guys.. I see a telephone. Where? Here! That's her phone alright. You think she's okay? She probably had a fight with Bart and went on a walk to let off some steam. Karen! There's an incoming text message. Read it. No! Are you kidding? I don't give a shit. Read it! "Your friend was taken into the forest. Get police." Oh, my God! Karen! Karen! Karen, you can come out now! I'm going inside. Ow! Son of a bitch! Yeah, Hello? I'd like to report a missing person. What? Yeah, a friend of ours.. Karen Hurdberger. Yeah, Hurdberger. I don't know.. What time... twenty minutes ago? Right. No.. You don't under... Right. Yeah, thanks. What did they say? He can't report a missing person for 48 hours. Yeah, we should have known that. Karen! Karen! What's that? What's he doing? Eeeew! A Peeping Tom! That's right. That's right.. Look up here. Come on, let's get inside. Let's go. Karen! Karen! No. No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Hey! What's going on out there? What a cock-knocker. "The animal we're going to discuss today has been spotted 6 to 8 times over the last year in Flatwood." "It's entirely possible for a bear to have wandered down close to civilization looking for food." "No, I don't believe this is a bear. Bears don't normally grow to over 12 feet." "But whatever it is... If it's come once for food to populated areas.. It will come again." "So you really think this is some kind of Bigfoot we've got roaming in these woods?" "Bigfoot? No, this is not Bigfoot. This is bigger than Bigfoot." "And meaner." "This is more like the Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas." "Vicious, dangerous." We should not go out there. Why not? We go out into the woods. If she's not there, we come back home. There is no way in hell I'm going into those woods alone. Whatever. Michelle, you and me. What if we leave and then she comes back while we're gone? What? Shut up! You're just scared! Jesus Christ! I don't even know why you came up here! All you ever care about is yourself the entire fucking time you've been useless! Bitch! Let's give it another 15 minutes, and if she's not back, I'll go find her, okay? Oh, fuck. Otis.. Come here! Otis! Otis, wake up! Otis.. Otis, wake up! Wake up, Otis! Come on! Preston? What? Over here by the window. What. Right there in those trees. My God. You see it? Yes. It's a giant piece of bread with legs on it! It was right there in those trees, I swear it. Otis, use these. Aaaaaah. What's this? Seeing girls in the shower, are we Preston? What? No! Don't be embarassed. This what you wanted me to see? No! That's... Otis, you've got to believe me. Wait'll Dr. Rainer hears about this. You keep enjoying yourself. I'll be right back. Otis! No! My God! She's gone! Otis! What happened? Look! You can't expect her to stay in the shower all night, Preston. No! It reached in the window and just grabbed her! Look, there's glass on the floor! Alright, Chief, just relax. Otis, we've got to get out of here. You're losing it, Man. Otis, please.. You've got to get us out of here! Aaaah! I get it! You'll do anything to go back home. No! You never wanted to come up here in the first place. Now you're making shit up so I'll take you back. Otis, please! Get off of me! Otis! Please! No. Wait. I'm going to give you something to calm you down. I'm calm. No. Please, no. You're rational right now, and you're going to have a time out. No, please. No! Otis! No! Preston! What the fuck! What did you do? What's this? What.. Did you find D.B. Cooper? That's an e-mail we received earlier tonight. Preston Rogers. Preston Rogers? Where do I know that name from? He and his wife were involved in that climbing accident about six months ago up at Suicide Rock. Oh, Boy. Whoo. What a shit colored mess that was. Wow. Did you reply to this? Well, yes Sir. We phoned up there but the lines are down. Sent an e-mail back.. No response. Should we go check it out? Oh, hey, hey.. Not so fast there pally. Why, that's a good 25 minute ride. Are you out of your gourd? Sheriff? I would say that Mister Rogers has lost his neighborhood. You know what I'm saying? I mean, he has not been the same since that accident. Now he's seeing monsters. What does that tell you? What, you think this is a hoax? No, I don't think it's a hoax. I just think the guy's got a hole in his screen door, that's all. Wooo! Maybe it's the Flatwoods Monster. Oh, hey, please. Zip it, will you dodo? I don't want to hear no more gibberish about no Flatwoods Monster. It's just a joke, Sheriff. Oh, yeah. Real funny. Ha ha ha. Monster's a real hoot. Anyway.. You know what to do with this.. Log it, write it up.. and when the phone lines get back we'll call the guy. And in the meantime, if you don't mind, I'm going to the head. Gonna give birth to a monster. Tracy? Tracy, open the door. Tracy, come on! I'm gonna need a bigger knife. Tracy! Let me in! Tracy, come on! Come on! Tracy! Tracy! My God! What are we gonna do?! We've got to get out of here! No. Call the police! Call the police! Wait! All of us go upstairs! Let's get away from down here! Get away from the window! Hey, look out!! Look out, it's coming!! Can you hear me?! Come on.. Look at the damn phone! Hello!! Is anybody there?!! This is an emergency!! There is some kind of creature outside your house!! What?! Tell you friends to stay away from the windows!! Something's happened to our friend!! I know.. I saw it!! Where is she!! Listen to me!! Can you call the police?! Our phone line's dead!! What about your cell phone?! Get out of there!! It's in the house!! We already tried it.. There's no reception here!! Go, go, go!! No. Don't move. It can hear you. Hide!! Quick!! Near. You're near. You got it. Go... Go... Go! Oh, my God! Are you okay?! Get up!! Go!! Over here!! Over here, quick!! C.J.!! You mother!! No! Run!! Hurry!! Open up!! Lock that door. Lock the other one. What the fuck is that thing? Quiet! We've got to be quiet! They're dead! They're all dead! My God! It's okay. It's okay. My bathroom's in there. Is it out there? No. It's alright, It's alright. Okay. Okay. It's alright. We're going to get out of this. I promise you. Okay? Right now, I need you to keep it together. Can you do that? The first thing you need to understand about animals is that they are hostile for just a couple of reasons. The first one being if they're hungry. The second one being if their territory or their young are threatened. I don't think that thing is still hungry. That gives us a little time until it comes back. Now, what's your name? Amanda. Well, Amanda.. I'm Preston... And I need your help. It's a long story. Look, I need to tell you something. I wasn't always in this wheelchair. About 6 months ago, my wife and I went climbing on Suicide Rock. It was a routine climb.. We've done it a dozen times. Only this time was different. This time the cable that was supporting us snapped. And my wife fell about 1000 feet to her death. I hit the face of the rock, and I got a lucky bounce and I landed on a narrow precipice. Took them about 4 hours to airlift me out of there. I didn't want to be alive anymore. I couldn't understand why... I had lived and she had died. And other than that time.. That moment when that cable snapped and I was falling through all of that empty space... Tonight is the scariest night of my life. I'm scared to death right now. Me too. Hey.. That means that we're alive. That means that we want to live. I was given a gift that day... And I don't know why. I mean, it was a miracle that I lived. I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that I don't waste that gift. I mean, we're smarter than that thing... And we are alive. And that is why we are going to beat it. How? I never thought I'd have a use for this stuff again. Hold that. Where are we going to set the trap? Well.. Where is the most likely place for it to attack from? Wait.. What if it decides to come through a window instead? We're going to make sure it comes in where we want it to. How? You'll see. Take that rope. Tie it to the end of the axe. Make sure it's tight. Where are you going? To get the bait. Raw meat? Grizzlies are attracted to strong scents. I've noticed this thing relies on its sense of smell more than anything else. Alright.. I'm going to lay this trip wire right at the bottom of the door. While I'm doing this, I want you to e-mail the police one more time. You have internet working up here? It's working off the satellite, not the phone. Okay. Amanda. Yeah? Don't mention anything about a monster. Why not? They won't believe you. Amanda. Right here. What's going on? I think it cut the power. How? I have no fucking idea. I thought you said it wasn't smart. Well, it's not supposed to be. I've just never heard of a creature like this. You didn't mention that before. I was trying to comfort you. What are we going to do? Let me think. You better think fast. That thing is a freak of Nature. The climbing gear. Get the climbing gear. Just do it. Thank God you're a predictable son of a bitch. It's right outside the front door. I brought this, too. Put that on. What is it? It's a harness. You can slide down the rope. What about you? I don't need one. Tie that to yours. Okay. Preston! It's here! Alright. I need you to help lift me over the rail. What? No, it's okay. I'm going to lower myself down. Amanda, listen to me. When I get down there, I'm going to secure the rope, and you follow me, alright? You clip on right here. Now, once you clip on, you're safe.. There's nothing going to happen to you, alright? Alright, come on. On three. One, two, three. What about this? You leave it. Alright. I'll see you down there. Now hook it on and swing your legs over. Hurry, Preston. Hurry, Preston. Okay... Okay... Okay. Now, come on. Hurry. Oh, God! Preston! Preston! No! Preston, help me! Oh, my God! Preston, help! Help!! Help!! Oh, God! Preston! Preston! Help! Hey! Ass Monkey! Eat this! Help! Preston! Preston! Amanda, unclip it! Unclip it!! Amanda, you alright? Come on, we've gotta move. Come on.. Pull! I'm trying! I'm trying!! Amanda, don't give up! I'm trying! I'm trying! Pull! A little bit more! Okay! That's good. Swing me around! Okay.. Come on! Come on, Amanda! Go! Go! Go! Go! Where are the keys?! Oh, shit! Where are the keys?! The visor! The visor! Alright, punch it!! Punch it!! Start the car! Start the car! I'm trying! I'm trying! Go!! Go!! Go!! Go!! Amanda, take your foot off the... No. No. That's it.. Keep moving. Oh, no. Die, you ugly fuck. Amanda. Amanda. Hey, can you hear me? Oh, my God. Preston? Yeah. Where is it? It's back there. Is it... Dead? Oh, God, I hope so. Let's not hang around and find out, though. Can you move? Yeah. Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Come on. Pull. Pull. It's the police! We're over here! You folks alright? Peachy. Preston Rogers? Yeah. Deputy McBride. I got your e-mail. Finally figured I should come up here and check it out. Deputy.. You'd better bring in the cavalry. You've got five dead people up there. Jesus. What the hell happened? You'd better go look for yourself. I gotta call this in. Alright. Well.. Fancy meeting you here. Preston? Yeah? For what it's worth... Thank you... For saving my life. Well.. Just didn't want you thinking I was some sort of Peeping Tom. Preston, I... Sheriff.. Still haven't found any bodies. Alright, let's check out the woods. What's the matter with you guys? Did you hear that? Parker... I thought you were a man. Jesus Christ. It's your imagination, Parker. There's nothing out here. Nothing but pine cones and frozen rattlesnakes. You guys are a bunch of candy asses, you know that? What the...?
