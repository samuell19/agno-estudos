This is this idea of what you have now. You can't even have a conversation anymore. This is the problem with your side of the aisle.

They, they hurt me all the time. I mean, I'll, I'll sort it out. The pain is certainly a problem as are the pills. Look, I'm not a junkie. And we're gonna arrange pain management. - For you. - I just a... I just overdid it. I just, I just took too much. I, I, I know, I know what I did. I know what I did wrong. It's okay. We have looked at your cat scans in detail and are concerned about tumors in your lungs. And we need to work you up... To discuss some things a little more with you and your family members, please. No, there's nobody. Everything okay? Just come join me. How about a couple of green teas? Sure. You sure have been a busy little bee since our last talk. What I do? Showing up on another police report. I try help. Yeah, had to help. I know. But what we talk about? - Stay to yourself. - Stay to yourself. Exactly. So if you understand, what am I doing sitting here having close to the same conversation we had a few days ago? You wanna stay here, go to work, school, then home, that's it. Remember, I snap my fingers and you, my one headache out of hundreds, gone. Stop scaring him. Sorry, sir. Sorry. No, I don't care who you are. You can't just go around threatening people with deportation. We'll get you a lawyer. Little lady, it's not a threat, if it's true. Never cross my desk. He'd be a ghost, which is what I want him to be. Next time, walk away at any sign of trouble. We have an understanding now? Yes. Thank you for your time and the lovely tea. Okay. It's Okay. Home sweet home. Whoa. Morty has a life of his own. So you fixed the fence? You like? Needs a coat of paint, but yeah, it looks good. Yeah, no, for sure. Listen Jacir, I, I know we butted heads, but I wanted to tell you that... Please, it's okay. I'm not apologizing. I mean, for what it's worth, I just wanted to say that I was looking for a fight and I thought you would've given me one. I come back. So how long do you know each other? Just a few weeks, since he started working at our restaurant. Ah. And you're dating? No, we don't really date in my house. My dad's a little strict. So you're? Single, I guess. You're too pretty to be single. Thank you. Hey, do you wear that thing, that? The hijab? Yeah. No. Good because you know, you just need a little makeup and I mean, you can, you, you got everything going on. Don't be so shy. This isn't Afghanistan, wherever the fuck that is. Okay.
