[lion roars] NARRATOR: Beyond this and into infinity, is man's last frontier. Over $2 billion light years of solar system reaching from the great clouds of Magellan to the galaxies of Andromeda and triangulum. Through the eons of time, man has searched the heavens, peering incessantly into the vast millions of miles of universe, questioning every star, every planet, can life exist? Like time itself, man search for the answer never stops. He moves closer and closer to his final destiny, exploration of the heavens. And so his probes have taken him deep into space. He passed the planets of Mars and Jupiter, Saturn and countless others. Relentlessly, he will seek new worlds to land on. And always he will wonder, if the next will be like the one before.

Pain unbearable. Please destruct. [gasping for breathe] Please destruct. Please distract. [blast] NARRATOR: With the destruction of spaceship Faith 1, the United States proceeded to test new power sources capable of carrying a ship far beyond the Earth's universe. Soon a probe would be hurled into space beyond the stars. Man would again seek the answer to an ageless question. And so in a day in the year 2000, the United States rocketship, Hope 1 lifted from the sands of Cape Kennedy. The world watched and listened as it thundered toward history and an answer. TV REPORTER: Back at Earth control once again. The activity here has settled down to its normal, if you can call it that routine. Now that Hope 1 has successfully been launched, the crews are back to their tracking and recording work. The ship is well on its way toward the space platform, which is its final checkpoint. I see General Mark Tillman, the head of the Space Agency and perhaps we can get a few words from him. General. General Tillman. General, could you tell our audience a little bit on how the developments are going so far? Well, everything seems to be going according to pre-flight plans. Is this your basically the same as Faith 1? There have been some refinement but basically, they are similar. Perhaps you could explain to our audience a little bit about the rather unique cabin design in the ship. Well, as you know, the entire ship has artificial gravity that eliminates weightlessness. In addition, each cabin is gyro stabilized so that whatever position the ship is in, each cabin can be individually rotated to an upright position. There are doors that the crew uses his passageway when the ship is in horizontal flight. Once the ship is in the vertical or landing position, the cabins can be rotated. Then the crew makes their way through the ship by a series of ladders. And now general what is the-- General. Washington on the line, sir. Excuse me. Thank you very much, sir. And that ladies and gentlemen concludes our coverage here of the activities at Earth control. To the crew of Hope 1, all of our best wishes for a safe and successful journey.

All systems function green. Dr. Wayne is checking our lab equipment we should hear from her soon. How do we look from there? EARTH CONTROL: Perfect launching from our end. Radar reports no corrections on a sync. Speed and acceleration as per plan. Everything's fine, no damage. Dr. Wayne reports no damage in lab. No further information at this point. Hope 1 is clear. Colonel. Now that we're underway, I hope that you're still not bitter about me being aboard. I am not bitter. But as I stated when I filed my protest-- Which was denied. --on a ship carrying only four crew, there's no place for a woman. That's not what Noah said when he built the Ark. Look, Lisa Wayne-- Dr. Wayne. Dr. Wayne, there's a couple of billion dollars tied up in this project. So when Earth command gave me this mission, they wanted someone who had a fair chance of getting this ship up there and back again. I thought I might at least, help select my crew. But I'm an officer, so I accept orders. But that doesn't make me think they're right. Well, Colonel, I'm beginning to think you don't like women. By the way, Colonel, I think I know where some of that billion must have gone. Oh. To build a special helmet for that fat head of yours. [laughter] Deadlier than the male. Don't judge it too quickly. And she's an extremely able scientist. It's not personal, doc. I just don't think that women belong in a job like this. Well, what else could we do? Aside from her abilities, weight was a very important issue in the decision. The only other scientist is qualified as our Dr. Wayne is Dr. Martin Barton, and he's a huge man. Makes a difference of 125 pounds. And that we divert it into equipment. And we need every ounce of equipment we can carry. And she carry some pretty good equipment of our own. I don't know what Barton looks like, but he can be as pretty as she is. Well, Let's just hope that the time doesn't arrive when we regret she isn't a man. Well, if I ever find myself regretting it, it's going to be too late anyway. [bleeps] We're picking up the relay of the space station. Sure, it looks pretty. But it would look a hell of a lot better if we were coming home. Make radio contact to check positions. Hope 1 calling space platform, over. SPACE CONTROL: This is space platform. You're on coordinate G. Bearing and speed, OK. You will pass in 30 seconds. Good luck. Well, it's too late to turn back now. We're red on approach again. Identified object, 11 o'clock. Paul, Lisa, come to control. I'd say it was some kind of, a spaceship. What's the matter? John thinks we are approaching a spaceship. We don't have any other ships as far out. That's just what I was thinking. Try to establish communications with a trial wavelengths. Give us a Barry. This is US ship, Hope 1 on open call, over. SPACE CONTROL: This is 109, Hope 1, United States spacecraft on open call for recognition. Do you read me? Call Earth control. Hope 1 calling Earth control. Hope 1 calling Earth control. Come in Hope 1. Come in Hope 1. We've made visual contact with the spaceship. Bearing? 10 minutes 27 seconds, coordinate G. Bearing, 10 minutes 27 seconds, coordinate G. Are there any other Earth ships in this area? SPACE CONTROL: There are no. Repeat. No other Earth ships in your area. See if they want an intercept. Do you wish us to intercept, over. GEN. MARK TILLMAN: This is General Tillman. This ship must be from another planet. If you had radio contact? Negative, John. GEN. MARK TILLMAN: If intercept as possible, board for further investigation. Keep us apprised of your situation. This is Earth controlled, clear. I want a course for intercept. Again, procedure. Exhaust velocity. 7.4 to 1. Systems report. Azimuth reading, green.

I can't spot any propulsion units. Could be a refueling station but nothing like I've ever seen. How do you plan to make contact. We'll bring our ship directly alongside. We don't get any signal from them. John and I, will try to board it. Moving at a position. Retros off. It's not one of ours, that's for sure, I wonder what that dome is? DR. PAUL MARTIN: Seems to be some sort of, crystal. Could be solar energy converters. Looks like an airlock under that light, but it's wide open. Still no sign of life. Paul try to make radio contact again. John, I'll get our suits on. This is Hope 1 standing by for recognition. Over. This is US ship, Hope 1 standing by for recognition. Over. We'll keep in touch with you. Now if anything goes wrong, contact Earth control for procedure. Right. Be sure to keep a close check on the radiation. Ready? Let's go. Earthship Hope 1 calling. Can you hear me? Follow me in 5 seconds. I'm approaching the airline. I'll be on the boarding step in a few seconds. Do you read me? We read you loud and clear. I'm in the airlock. John's almost in the luggage. Compartment doesn't seem to have any airtight hatches, everything's open. We're starting up into the ship going through a hatch into a passageway. There's heavy instrumentation on both sides. we're in the ship now, Paul. Strangest thing I've ever seen. Radiation still a low. We're going into the main room. I can hear all kinds of, sounds, Paul. It could be coming from other parts of the ship. Ahead of us, there's a rotating tower, could be a power source. There's a scope in here. I can see our ship on it. Still no sign of life here. This tower looks like it runs up through the length of the ship. Seems to be connected to the dome. We're going to check the rest of the ship. Paul. We've got company. Paul. Nice and easy. [roar] [inaudible] [inaudible] he's choking me. [gunshot] You're all right? Yeah. What's going on here? It seems the stuff we he felt, like, there was some connection with him in the machinery. But let's get out of here. Radiation is rising fast. Paul, we had to kill the aliens. All hell's breaking loose in here. Put a grade A bomb with a timer in the airlock and leave the lock open, we're coming back. Come on. We're standing out of the airlock. John just left the boarding step. I'm moving off now. Approaching the airlock. I'll be on the boarding step in a few seconds. And what do think you're doing? I got to destroy that ship. You can't go back there. And they just drifted loose out there with radiation building up. If it falls in the gravitational pull of the Earth, no telling what might happen. Get in the controls and get things set for a quick move out. DR. JOHN ANDROS: OK. I never figured him for the hero-type. What about the radiation, Lisa? Well, the suit should protect him as long as he's not in there too long. I'm moving into the control room. [inaudible] as fast as possible in that ship. Radiation is rising. I'm setting the bomb for 10 minutes. DR. PAUL MARTIN: Hurry up, Hank. Don't take a chance on that radiation. I'm through. I'm coming back. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Rockets on. [blast] Nothing left but a bad memory. Paul. Contact Earth control, report. Hope 1 calling Earth control. This is Hope 1 calling Earth control. EARTH CONTROL: This is Earth control. Go ahead Hope 1, over. This is Hope 1, Dr. Martin speaking. The alien ship has been destroyed, over. Let me talk to Colonel Stevens. COL. HANK STEVENS: Mr Stevens, over. What happened Hank? Once we were boarded the ship, we found one crew member. He attacked Dr. Andros and in a fight we had to kill him. GEN. MARK TILLMAN: Have you any idea where this ship came from? No, sir. Except that I'm sure it wasn't from Earth. The controls were unlike anything I've ever seen before and the language seemed to be an assembled code. At least, I didn't recognize anything on any of the instruments. All right, Hank. I wish we might have made peaceful contact with them. Yes, sir. So do I, but he attacked Dr. Andros before we had a chance to communicate. That's all, Colonel. Keep us informed with your progress. Yes, sir. Hope 1 clear. Finally, to discover another race, then have to destroy it. DR. JOHN ANDROS: What did he look like? Well, he had arms and legs. Now from a shoulder down he looked like anyone from Earth, except the face wasn't. I got of a nightmare. [chuckles] Oh, man. Was he ugly. And he wouldn't make any small talk either. And we try to be friendly, but as soon as we got close enough, he attacked John. Hey, you know what? That makes me the first man from Earth to make contact with the-- with someone from another planet. Do you know what the boys in the magazines would pay for that story? That's what it means to you? The fact that we discovered another life form means nothing? Well I'll tell you the way I figure it. We've got enough troubles on Earth now. I mean, we're barely keeping from killing each other off. So? Well, suppose we had managed to make contact with him. So we treated them nicely, we became friendly. You know what happens then? Well, pretty soon someone on Earth decides that we don't like the way they look or maybe they won't like us. Well, after all, one of us is going to be on minority group. And the next thing you know, wham over trying to blast each other out of existence. So that's why I say, we've got enough troubles. Now they're trying to find someone else to make as there. And now if you'll pardon me, I'm going to change you to something a little more comfortable. [music playing] COL. HANK STEVENS: John. John, wake up. Check the gyro bearing. Same as before. You don't go in much for beach parties? You know, warm summer's night, a little fire, finally companionship. Should beat flying one of these things. Well you don't get to fly one of these things, as you call them, by roasting marshmallows around a fire. Roasting marshmallows isn't the part I miss. Well, let's face it. You can't cuddle up to a spaceship on a cold winter's night. I like fun as well as anyone else. These ships are a 24-hour a day job, especially training for a flight like this. You tell them skipper, but things might not be too dull. I've seen a lot worse than our lady doctor. Yeah. I bet you have. I'm sure even you you've noticed that she fills out a spacesuit a lot better than any of us. Don't you think about anything else? Well, I'm only kidding. No one wants to see this flight succeed more than I do. Really? That surprises me. When we were in training, I got the feeling that this was all just a big joke to you. Well, just because I managed to have a few laughs that doesn't mean it isn't important to me. I thought the only thing important to you was an unlimited supply of women. And I still, but there are other things I'm aiming for. Well, at least, you're honest about it. It doesn't matter to me why you're here as long as we understand each other. You do your job and we'll get along. Yes, sir. How many times are you going to check that stuff? You don't have to prove anything to me. What's that supposed to mean? Well, we're not all like Hank, you know. You don't have to crusade for equality. I'm more than happy to have on board. Think of those long nights ahead. Oh buster. Just don't start that. Well, I mean, we can keep each other company. Hank isn't going to be much fun and every time he talked the ball he starts waving that flag for humanity's salvation at TIROS. This is why we're here, isn't it? Look, Colonel Stevens may have some rather archaic views about women, but I'm still sure that he's the best man for the job. Well, well. I think your bark is worse than your bite. And you think it is something nice about him? He's entitled to think anything he wants about me. I just know that I'll make him change his mind. Do you think you to make me change my mind, easily? You mind? [chuckle] That mind doesn't need to be changed, it needs to be dry cleaned. You know, I think my charm escapes you. Oh God. Oh, no, no. You-- you make sure that I'm completely aware of it. It's just that-- well, I don't think it's fair to take advantage of the fact that I'm the only woman available. You may be the only woman but you're not making yourself available. Now look, if you'll behave yourself, I'll go and get something to eat. Everything all right? I suppose. You know it-- It's funny, doc. The more we know about flight, the less there is for people like me to do. In the early days, the men flew the ships, now the ships fly the men. Well, it's-- it's not quite that simple? No. And the aft section set the computers. These feed them cancer information. Automatically, we correct course and speed. These things can handle anything. So sure but they still only machines. They can only analyze the information they receive, they can't anticipate what might happen. And in case they malfunction, everything's in your hands. Mm. I suppose. Look, I spent most of my life building these machines. And believe me, I know their limitations. Yeah. In a way, I guess you're right. A million things can go wrong. DR. PAUL MARTIN: Well, nothing is for nothing, Hank. Look at all the failures that we experience putting this project together. Now terrorist is what we think it is. We can provide life for millions. You know, how I think it was for [inaudible].. Like, Columbus setting out to find a new world. And that's an opportunity not afforded many people in all history. Gentlemen. Dinner is served. Here you are, Paul. Lobster thermidor, somewhat compressed, of course. It's not Maine lobster, And for Stevens, a nice thick juicy steak, some caviar, or perhaps you'd like our special deluxe. All guaranteed, non poisonous. Number 2, please. And easy on the gravy. Well, I believe you're trying to be pleasant. And for you one meatball. You put too much garlic in it, it gives me heartburn. You should have tasted this stuff before they made it into bills. This was something before they made in the bill? Right on approach. Swarm of meteorites dead ahead, 1.8. What's our speed? 3.5. Strap in quick. How close the meteorites? 40 seconds. I'm setting up the force shield around the ship. If there are too many, we should be able to deflect. We're almost through. We're using a lot of power, how long can we use a shield? 25 second maximum. Oh. we're through. All see your lock. Unstrap. [bangs] What's our speed? 125,000. Are going faster all the time. Keep gaining speed will either use up all our power or burn the ship up. Keep comm on our speed over the intercom. - Right. - I'll check the computers. Come on, Paul. Turn them off, Hank. John, switched to manual, we're turning off computers. DR. JOHN ANDROS: Roger. Switching the manual. Manual on green. How's our Speed DR. JOHN ANDROS: Crocodile. I think we're still gaining. That reactor is liable to blow itself up. Try to check in our position. DR. JOHN ANDROS: Checkin position. How about that position? We should be nearing the triangulum galaxy. Paul, come on. [warning tones] We're running too hot, I've got to turn off the reactor. We used a lot of power in the last few minutes. And that's can take us to Tyros and back again. We're closing fast. Our only chance is to try to land somewhere and repair our trouble. Paul, will the guidance system work with the computers off? I don't think so. But all you'll be able to get, will be your speed and course. And if you want to change direction, you'll have to use a retrorockets. Or your gyro compass is working? DR. JOHN ANDROS: Negative on gyros. I'll check for malfunctions. Air circulation, OK. Cabin pressure, OK. Emergency electrical system, OK. About all we can do is keep on going and hope we can find something to land on. DR. JOHN ANDROS: What's that corny phrase? A needle in a haystack? COL. HANK STEVENS: Moving through a cluster. Stand by. DR. JOHN ANDROS: I'm getting a reading on magnetic pulse. How's our course? John give me a reading on the macro. DR. JOHN ANDROS: Object reading rising. 8% deviation from true course. At this speed, that's about a million miles so far. [alarm] Reading on scope dead ahead, 60 seconds. SPACE CONTROL: Maybe we're in luck. Meg pulse indicates a gravitational pull. Land mass indicator reading 40% solidity, 60% water. Start closing procedure check. 60, 40, 30. 30 second duration. All instruments check green. Start power, Constant. CONSTANT: Power on. Ready on green. When we're 20 seconds away, I'm going to give it for reverse thrust. I think I can risk about that much power. You've got one shot at this landing, that's it. EARTH CONTROL: Start your count now. 25, 4, 3, 2, 1, 20. Reactor's on. Start landing procedure. SPACE CONTROL: EARTH CONTROL: Stabilize. [dramatic music] Servos on. [inaudible] 4.5 on descent. Retros on. [dramatic music] Retros off. Ready rockets. Rockets on. We're coming down on a plane. Steady as you go. Something's wrong. We're overshooting the landmass. We're going to hit water. [dramatic music] Brace! [crash] Main power off. Generator on. Rotate cabin. [machine turns] How to research Earth control? This is hope one calling Earth control. Activate the hatch. This is hope one to Earth control, over. I'm going to check the ship. This is hope one calling Earth control. I'll hook the exhaust to start regeneration. This is hope one calling Earth control. This is hope one calling Earth control. [beeping] This is hope one calling Earth control. Hope one calling Earth control. [machine turn off] [machine comes on] This is hope one calling Earth control. No good. Can't seem to get through. Must be metallic interference in the water. What's it look like? Well, it's pretty much of a guess. We're somewhere near the Triangulum galaxy. I figure that this is one of the moons that has escaped from its orbit. As close as we can figure from these charts we're a couple of million miles from anywhere. Well, whatever it is, we're stuck here. Well, have we got enough power to make a drive for Earth. If we did, I'd give it a shot. Well, how did we use up so much of it? I thought there was enough to last four months. When the computer was damaged it through the power to the limit. So? The reactor burns on its own heat. Parallel is like a gas combustion engine. Idling or cruising, you use less gas when driving at full speed. The heat of the reactor varies inversely to the demand put on it. So with a tremendous speed we were traveling, it almost depleted itself. Well, being stuck here at the bottom of the ocean of who knows where isn't making me any money. So how do we get out of here? The generator's feeding electricity into the reactor which it converts into heat. Now we're stuck here till we can regenerate enough power to get us back. Paul, I want you to check the computers first thing. Right. We don't have a chance of getting back without them. [sighs] Well, about all we can do is sit here relax and enjoy it. Better get some sleep. We'll start fresh later on. EARTH CONTROL: Come in, hope one. This is control calling hope one. This is Earth control calling hope one. Come in, hope one. Come in, hope one. It's no use. I can't raise them. General Tillman, please. General, no sir, no answer yet. There are now six hours overdue. Yes, sir, I'll enter it in the log right away. Hope one, location unknown. [sad music] I wish we could get through to Earth control. Eh, we don't have much to tell them. They can't do a thing for us where we out of range of any rescue ship. Well, we could have at least told them that we're safe. If you call where we are safe. Well, we seem to have survived any immediate danger. It's a question of fixing the computer. The time to power source or rebuild. I don't think it'll ever get back to 100% efficiency. I think we'll have enough to get us back to Earth. You warming up for another dream? Ooh, Just a little something to give me strength. You can command my body, but I insist that I have my own dreams. You ever would think about the good times back on Earth, assuming there were times that you forget that your lady doctor? Well, with someone like you around, how could I think of anyone else? Touche. When I get back to Earth, I'm not going to let any female that's had more than a high school education get next to me. You're making me too easy to read. I thought you were going to spend all your time making speeches and writing books. But you may be happy to know that I'm going to devote some space to you in my book, about one line should do it. Oh, I think I hit a nerve. Yeah, I guess it is, it's a shame our communications won't work. We don't want anybody to forget us, do we, John? Well, this is even better. Think of the suspense. Stuck underwater, how will we escape? What, will I be able to save the ship? Will the strength of my personality be strong enough to keep us all from cracking up? I can see now this is going to be a love story. A love story? Yes, your own. How's this for a title? Me and my mirror. [laughter] How about going on a lecture tour with me when we get back? I'll do the hero stuff, and you can break up the audiences with your comedy routines. If you really want to write, how about a chapter on fixing computers? I mean this has been very nice but I suggest we start repairs. Now if you'll come along, I'll give you a little practical experience. Coming, Hank. [underwater] Lisa. It's so quiet. I've been sitting here pretending that we're not where we are. Silly game for lady scientist, isn't it? Well, the ships not in bad shape. Paul and I can probably fix that computer. And you're afraid? That's just what I was wondering, isn't everyone afraid? Well, we all knew what could happen on a trip like this. No one guaranteed we'd make it. I wasn't looking for any guarantees. It's just that back on Earth it all seemed so noble. Everything was remote. But here, well, hear it's different. [sad music] I'm still glad I was the one they chose. I mean, what we're doing it's something important. But what good is it if it all stops here? Look, I've got too much of my life tied up in this ship to stop now. Even if we don't make it Tiros, at least we know the ship's capable of it. Maybe another crew on another ship will be able to succeed where we failed. Say, I-- I've been wanting to tell you, I-- I shouldn't have popped off about having a woman along. I'm glad you're with us. That's quite a compliment coming from you. I mean it. Say, maybe if we get back to Earth, you can take me out for a real dinner some night. [laughs] You just name it. Uh, is there anyone back home? Not really. I've been so busy the last few months I don't think anyone even remembers me. Good. How about you? Or are you married to your job? I guess I have been. But I think I can arrange a separation, temporarily anyway. Long enough for one dinner, right? It's been my life for a long time. You know, it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks. And you're saying I'd make a good teacher? Stranger things have happened. Not to me, they haven't. Look, you can go on and play Tom Swift and his flying machine forever as far as I'm concerned. What brings this on? All I said was we could have dinner. You can't teach old dogs new tricks. Why, you act like you'd be some kind of a bargain. Don't do me any favors. Phooey. What a temper. I've never been calmer in my life. I'd hate to see you when you were mad. I never get mad. It's just you are the most conceited, pompous-- [inaudible] Now, that does it. Oh, look. Look, stop being so feisty and listen. I have never been one for fancy speeches. What I was trying to say is that I want to be with you when we get back. Now, if that's a crime, just say something. Well, you sure go about it in a funny way. But I accept your apology. Apology? And I think it's very sweet of you to do it. I like you, Tom Swift. I think we'd be very good together. Just get me back to Earth, and I'll show you what I mean. That's tomorrow's job. [romantic music playing] Funny thing, I woke up last night with the strangest feeling everyone had gone off and left me. You must have been restless too. I noticed your bunk was empty. You ought to take a sleeping pill. Cure your troubles for you. Oh no. Pills make me dream. You know how unsatisfactory that is. DR. JOHN ANDROS: I imagine yours would be. Hand me that roll of wire, please. Did I ever tell you about the girl Lisa reminds me of? Now, there was a real charmer, lived right up the beach from me in a little bungalow. And could she cook! Almost convinced me to give up my sinful ways. Obviously, you didn't. Well, I got to figuring that why make one woman happy and ruin the hopes of so many others? It's a shame you have to waste all your charm on us. Well, I'll make up for lost time when I get back. Why don't you stop the talk and get a little work done? Oh, another doctor heard from. Gentlemen, let me remind you I didn't sign on this pleasure cruise to be a mechanic. Will you stop? My tears are liable to start out something. Well, let me just change the title of my book to Ships I've Crashed On. Nothing personal, Hank. You better hope you're able to write anything at all. Unwritten books by dead heroes are in very short demand. Lord knows I've tried my best for all of us. But it's not my fault we landed here instead of on Tiros. What's that supposed to mean? Well, like the prince said to Cinderella, the shoe fits. Why, you phoney glory hound. It sure as heck isn't my fault. Well, I didn't turn off the [inaudible] screen. And I didn't decide to land on this screwy planet. All right. Now, we know what you didn't do. Just what did you do? Now, this is ridiculous. [inaudible] Just a minute, Paul. Before that halo you're wearing slips down and chokes you to death, there's something we better get straight. I command this ship on the ground, in the air, or underwater. I make the decisions. I give the orders. I don't have to explain them to you. And another thing-- I told you before I didn't care why you came along. Well, I think I do care. There isn't room for guys like you. All you ever think about is you. Number one, you. Who are you to judge me? What, you're so perfect you can't be criticized? I do my job. And when the time comes, I'll be right there. Would you think I know the trouble we're in? Now look, I could suggest that you two step outside to settle this. But you might get a bit wet. [SNORTS] Now, maybe, you know, that it's a good idea to blow off a little steam. But let's realize we all need each other. Just stay out of my way. With pleasure. Now, can we get back to work? [spaceship beeping] Hi. Hi. How grows your garden? Better all the time. You look mighty perky. Well, it-- it'd help me to talk to someone. Yeah, me too. [rumbling] What's that? Must be an underground tremor. I think we better get up to the control room. John, up to the control room. Move the scope around. See if you can pick anything up. DR. JOHN ANDROS: Seems clear enough. I'll change the angle. Nothing there. DR. PAUL MARTIN: Seems active enough out there. COL. HANK STEVENS: Switch camera position. I wonder if it could be eruptions from under the ocean floor that's creating the noise. Hit it again, John. Looks like something's moving out there. Switch to a close up lens. [dramatic music playing] Good Lord. DR. LISA WAYNE: What a horrible looking creature. What are they? I don't know. They're really tremendous. I think it's the first sign of life we've seen on this planet. They don't seem to be bothering the ship. COL. HANK STEVENS: They could be afraid of the exhaust from the generator. But what are they? Well, I'm not sure. But I think they're another species of crab. But they're so huge. Well, huge or not, it means there's life here. Do you think there's life on the land? Well, you see the legs on those things. In the pattern of nature, they wouldn't have legs just to live in the ocean. What do you mean? Well, many people believe that the first Earth mammals were fish. They've crawled out of the water and evolved into animals. It's happened before. Why can't it happen again? But the size of those things. Well, remember the creatures that roamed the Earth. Dinosaurs? They were things of size. Well, this planet may be in the same stage of development that Earth was millions of years ago. If that's so, there may be life, even humans on the land. Maybe. I wonder what the people would be like. Well, it's hard to tell how far they've developed. But if there are people-- There is a way. We plan to search underwater on Tiros, right? Right. What's to stop us from taking advantage of our equipment and exploring the land? Crabs for one thing. I think I can handle them when the time comes. You mean leave the ship, swim to shore, pick up samples, return to the ship. When you say it fast, it doesn't sound hot. While we're fixing the computers, one of us can go ashore, maybe find we can live or that life can sustain itself here as well as it can on Tiros. Only one problem. You can't wear a pressure suit underwater. And when you emerge in a scuba set, you can't equalize the pressure on your body. We need to check the atmosphere from down here. But how? Can we use a pneumatic release line underwater? Yeah, sure. What are you planning to do? Well, we're carrying these vacuum tubes that you were going to use for air analysis. We could float one to the surface. When it reaches the air, it'll fill up and then reseal. Then, we can bring it back down here and see what the atmosphere is like. - Hey. That sounds good. Great. Come on. Let's get it set. Once the tube emerges from the water, the release of pressure will flip out this valve. Then, the air will rush in. The cap will expand and seal itself. Just behind this line [inaudible].. Here we go. [watery sounds] [popping] Well, it's through. I'll wait a few more seconds. Then, I'll bring it down. OK, I'll bring it back now. Carbon dioxide 0.3%, nitrogen 76%, oxygen 23%, density 5.2, mass 0.82. The air is almost the same as it is on Earth. The gravity is a little lighter but not much. That means that you should be able to breathe once you get on shore, and there shouldn't be any pressure problems. Well, it's worth a try. Well, there's no doubt about who should go. It's my baby. OK, let's break out a suit. Now, land should lie just past the bow of the ship, not too far, I don't think. I'd stay close to the bottom all the way. I don't want one of those crabs mistaking you for the blue plate special. - Haha. Very funny. Now, just before you go, I'll give them a little jolt with the forescreen. I can't leave it on too long, long enough for you to have time to get clear, I hope. Now, on the trip back, inside the airlock, there's a portable torch. It'll give you a defense against anything underwater. And once outside, check your transmitter. Oh, here's your sample kit. With all this junk, I'm going to look like a Christmas tree. Doc, take him to the airlock. When you're set, call me. I'll hit the power for five seconds. Right after that, out you go. You set? Well, I guess it's hero time. Now remember, you spell the name Andros, A-N-D-R-O-S, for the ship's log. Good luck. [dramatic music playing] COL. HANK STEVENS: They're bunching up. Power's building to activate. You about ready to go John? DR. JOHN ANDROS: All set, Hank. I'm setting up the force shield around the ship. If there aren't too many, we should be able to scatter them. [dramatic music playing] That should hold them for a while. All clear. Go, John. I'll be back for dinner. Keep the [inaudible] warm. Water temperature normal. Mask on. I'm on my way. Well, nothing we can do for him now. Think I'll take a look at those computers. [bubbling] How long should it take him? Oh, a couple hours, maybe more. Do you think he's going to be all right? Let's not think him into trouble. We'll just have to wait. [bubbling] [dramatic music playing] [scary music playing] [scary music playing] [music playing] How long has he been gone, Hank? Oh, a couple of hours. It's hard to concentrate on this. I keep worrying about him. Yeah, me too. We'll never get back if we don't fix it. Without it, we can't maneuver. Assuming we can get out all right, we can find our way back here, can't we? Yeah. In the astral guide, there's a recorder that fixes our position every inch of the way. Well, we'll soon have these back to normal. Yeah, power seems to be rebuilding OK. I think we're going to be in pretty good shape. [music playing] DR. LISA WAYNE: [ON SPEAKER] Hank, our friends seem to be stirring again. COL. HANK STEVENS: That's all we need, another visit from those things. We'd better get back to the control room. Well, maybe you're right. DR. JOHN ANDROS: [ON SPEAKER] Hank, can you read me? Come in. We read you, John. Are you all right? DR. JOHN ANDROS: There seems to be tracks from something but haven't seen a thing. I'll be in the water in a few seconds. Putting on my lung. I'm on my way. Just be careful, John. [music playing] [dramatic music playing] DR. JOHN ANDROS: [ON SPEAKER] It's got a hold of me. [dramatic music playing] [bubbling] It's crushing me. I can't breathe. Use your torch, John. Burn them off. [dramatic music playing] DR. JOHN ANDROS: [ON SPEAKER] It worked. It let loose. But I think I've had-- I'm trying to get back. [bubbling] John! He's hurt. We'll bring him in. Get the aid kit. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [COUGHING] COL. HANK STEVENS: Good Lord. DR. JOHN ANDROS: The land looks good. I think we found-- it's what we've been looking for. [GASPING] John? Oh no. [CRYING] No. That should have been me. It was my idea. Don't talk nonsense, Hank. He knew what might happen. Was it worth his life? It all depends on your viewpoint. Well, can't you see the fantastic parallel? He discovered life on a planet that's like Earth reborn. And surely some hand must have guided us here too. Must be more than an accident that in all the lifeless galaxies that we have to land on this planet. We were meant to find this place and to return to Earth. You want to believe in fate? OK. As far as I'm concerned, it's just one lousy piece of real estate. Well, there's one thing for sure. If we don't get to work on those computers we'll never get back to spread the word. [music playing] [inaudible] ? Well, that's it. You set? Are you thinking about John? Yeah. Yeah, I've thought about him a lot. He taught me something. Oh? You can't judge people by your own standards. That old business of his, you know, about the publicity, I think it was mostly a cover-up. I mean, it was like he was embarrassed because he really believed in what we were doing. So he kept talking about writing that book. I wish I could have known him better. Yeah. Well, let's get Lisa. Activate the hatch. It's growing. Hm? Well, John must have planted it. Everything checks out. The water can be drunk. The air is thin but breathable. Earth people can live here. They can live here. [music playing] COL. HANK STEVENS: Strap in. Well, here we go. Power on. Controls to auto. DR. PAUL MARTIN: All lights on. All systems green. Close hatch. [ship whirring] I'm going to try to ease us up. Something's holding us. What's that? [banging] Sounds like the ship is cracking. Look. Look at that. DR. PAUL MARTIN: That's the biggest one we've seen. COL. HANK STEVENS: He's not the problem. He's nowhere near the ship. DR. PAUL MARTIN: One of them must have attached himself right to the ship. [banging] The thing must weigh five tons. What are we going to do? We've got to get rid of that weight. I don't know if it will work, but I'm going to activate the force field, try to shake him off. [force field whirring] Let's go. Doc, hit those switches. Ready your rockets. Paul, start your 10-second countdown. Now. DR. PAUL MARTIN: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. DR. PAUL MARTIN: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Hit your switches. COL. HANK STEVENS: All systems green. Here we go. Rockets on. [rockets blasting] [music playing] We're through. Rotate cabin. [whirring] Setting controls for home. One more thing to do. [music playing] Hope One calling Earth control. Hope One calling Earth control. This is Hope One calling Earth control. EARTH CONTROL: This is Earth Control. Go ahead, Hope One. This is Hope One. Mission accomplished. We found a livable planet. And we've named it Andros One. Now, be sure you spell that right. That's A-N-D-R-O-S One. [music playing]
