You must do something. There's nothing to be done. He's dead. He looks happy. He's dead. He also looks happy. He didn't even break when he fell. And he isn't bloody, either. He's dead. Hand me the cuff, Solange. It's nice, don't you think so? Solange... - What? - Fetch the coat. What coat? - From the outfit, okay. - It's not here. Send it to the lab to cut the collar. And what's the big hurry? Is there a fire or something? Go on, see to getting it. How do I get used to the idea of the group without him? And be quick about it! I'm starting to get fed up! Lucienne. The outfit! Don't move! Juliette, M. Clarence wants to see the coat. - It's not finished. - It doesn't matter, take it anyway. - It's not a question of... - Take it and mark it. Lucile, give me the red silk beside Jacqueline! Have you seen Solange? - How she warbles! - He doesn't like the collection either. It's always the same. Have you seen her laugh once? - She struck me as nice. - At heart, she isn't bad. - Countess. - Farewell, darling. Mme. Anne-Marie! The "Echos of Fashion" ask when the collection will be released. When will they be released? I don't know. The date hasn't been set. Is M. Clarence there? - He doesn't want to be bothered. - As usual. You'll be the first in knowing it. You can count on me. - Thank you, Madame. - Goodbye, Monsieur. - She has the patience of an angel. - Of a dead mosquito, you could say. - It doesn't do you good. - You noticed me? Of course. - Is my dress ready? - I believe so. Lucile, announce to the workshop that Suzie Lambert has arrived. Immediately. Because I sing tonight and not in the nude. You'll have it later. Good... Undo the coat. The coat isn't bad. It's nice. What's ugly is the suit. Let's go, undress, Lucienne! Give me the fabric, Solange. Personally, I like the dress. Who is it? No! It's out of the question! - Who was it? - Anne-Marie. Suzie Lambert wants to talk with you. This sweater has such small sleeves! I had tea from 5:00 to 5:30. I might go. Call me Huguette. Don't bother Huguette. Since you ask so nicely, I'll stay. Why do you lower your head? What fabric! It's no disaster! Blame the manufacturer. Good idea. The Maison Rousseau? I'm M. Clarence. May I have the M. Daniel from Lyon? I don't believe so, M. I'll speak with the secretary. M. Clarence asks for M. Rousseau. - Good day, M. - Is your boss there? No. He's still in Paris, but left in the afternoon. Where is he? I don't know. He hasn't told me. You don't know, but I do! Goodbye! Turn around! You're going to listen to me! - I looked for it... - I don't have time! How'd it go? - I tried on the dress, but... - What? - What I wanted angered them. - The design is silk. I know, but try to understand it. Nothing has been sung in public? No, and what? Don't think that it's just nerves! They don't see, but I sweat oceans and my hands get clammy. And this fabric marks the hips. Fix it! And does it feel good to place your hands like this? It's not very elegant, but it's my style. Maybe you should change the style or the suit. - Philippe? - What do you want? You're going to make yourself sick with this collection. Don't worry. Today is going badly. What's going on? That's how it goes. - It bothers me to change them. - It's very ugly. Maybe I like the chimneys and won't change my opinion. Be demanding! The smart ones are. - What brings you hear? - You're a thoughtless person. - What comes next? - Why aren't you in Lyon? Is that the sweater? Yes, maybe it'll do for the curtains. Don't go, Monsieur. Is that the decorator? Perhaps it interests him for upholstering furniture. Unfortunately, I'm a designer. Excuse me, M. Rousseau, I have to talk to my supervisor. Don't act so nervous in front of people... who don't know that you don't mean what you say. It's not my fault that I don't like your collection. Two months your father has made me wait for these fabrics! He can make them or he can't! It's that simple! Clearly! You think he owes the thirsty of Lyon... it's murder for artists of your class... when the debts are boundless, when nobody is reliable? How's that so? Or when they pay badly, it's the same. You are incredible! I'm blocked, the time flies, my collection makes no progress, and the one time I come to see you, you're busy with your flat! I marry in three weeks and I'll have to live in another city! But this doesn't solve my problems! Your problems! I leave tonight. - That's what you say. - I have a reserved bed. - Return with your collection! - Bah, my collection! - That's the way it is. - When do you marry? Within three weeks. We haven't fixed a date. - I don't believe you're getting married. - What? I don't believe it. I'll believe it when I see your fiancee. She's not in Paris yet, the Mademoiselle...? Micheline Lafaury, 19 years old, an orphan. She's not in Paris, she's in Reims. I expect her one of these days. Imagine living in Reims! - The champagne's nothing like the west. - Take the elevator. - You're really going? - Yes, I promise you that. - When? - In 4 or 5 days. Don't get bored! Ah! I want you to be my witness. What? I want you to be my witness. - You're fighting in a duel? - No, idiot, at the wedding! - Then explain it to me! - What are you telling me? Ask your uncle Luis. It'll be perfect. - Which floor? - The fifth. I can imagine it. Good, we're here. There's no light. You have to knock. What's the meaning of this? Explain it to me! As she hasn't been here, I thought I'd show her around. This is the dining room. Not to insist, but we'll eat as briefly as possible. I prefer not to stick to a seat. You think the corners of the flat are more pleasing? This is the grand salon. An unused room. An idiotic bourgeois tradition. They aren't used for anything. You think they're used for something? This is the sitting room. They're knocking down a wall. How strange! This will be to expand the grand salon. It's also tradition. We haven't finished. It's a very beautiful floor. You can see the garden from six rooms. This is the bedroom. On principle you'll sleep here, but we can sleep there, even though it will be awkward for the servants. They'll have to register the flat to know where to serve breakfast. - It will have made a bad impression. - Are you finished? Yes. Oh, pardon! I haven't introduced my friend, Daniel Rousseau, manufacturer of tapestries. - My friend, Philippe Clarence. - I thought as much. - Well, what have you heard? - Loads of things. - Then I prefer to go. - Bye, Mademoiselle. - I'll accompany you. By the way, if you're still planning to marry the same man, come Sunday and we'll work on a wedding dress for you. - It's a gift. - Are you crazy? Why? Don't pay him any heed. You'll have plenty of time later. What's with you? I'll expect her Sunday at 11. That's a good time. You leave me right by her. What a face you have! - She arrived last night. - Sure, sure... I'll leave the material I forgive you. But you have to be lucky to be so pretty. Clear off! - Excuse me, but I'm in a hurry. - I'll attend to it immediately! I didn't know where you were. I looked for a mirror. There was only one on the whole floor. Still, it's not very liveable yet. What does it look like to you? - Amusing. - Amusing? The architecture's a bit antiquated, but the decorator's going to change it. I wasn't referring to the apartment, but to your friend. Does he make beautiful things? He's one of the best in Paris. The very best, if he were more serious. He isn't serious? What should we do about the dress? It bothers me to refuse it, but I think it's for the best. Why? In our world, it's not decent that the wedding dress... is given away from a stranger. - My good Daniel! - Don't call me that! - Sorry. What are you going to tell me? That I'm very lucky because you're serious all year long. What are you implying? Mademoiselle... I'm sorry, Monsieur Rousseau, but I have to go. Don't go! We're going to want it right away. Let's go to the bottom floor. Follow us, Monsieur Lemoine! I want to see Monsieur Clarence. - He's not here. - He asked me to come here now. I'll go see. Accompany me to the salon. ¡Listen a second! ¡Good news! We're scrapping the collection and starting from scratch. Yes, that's good news. - What's up? - M. Clarence has sketched all night and has found a new style. Then it won't suit my taste! - Can you come? - Why? A woman said that M. Clarence has an appointment with her. I'll go. And what should we do? For now, continue. They'll give us orders soon. Basically, I don't like my clothes. The collection has crossed the line. It's worse to have to redo it all. We'll have to work hours overtime! I'm seeing it now. Yes, indeed... If you don't like it, see the boss. Don't be a nuisance to me. Get to work! - Do you have an appointment with M. Clarence? - In effect. - What's your name? - Mlle. Lafaury. What, do you like them? Yes, very interesting. Interesting! You're incredible! Faint praise! They're sensational! Marvellous! They may be, but the sketches aren't clothes. I know, but the clothes depend on some good designs. See this? We made the sweater red. Enter! It'll be a masterpiece. - Mlle. Lafaury is expecting you. - I don't know who that is. The difficulty was to make the models distinctive, but to retain a certain likeness. Something that relates between them, yes. The collections are as they are. I walked blindly, but now I see. - Then you dismiss her? - Whom? - The girl over there. - How is she, pretty or ugly? - Better than ugly. - Then have her come right up. No, that's a joke! You thought that I was going to make it with her? Tell her I won't receive anyone. You should be a beauty! Each time Anne-Marie criticizes a woman, I know she'll be my style. - She still wants you. That's what was weighing me down. When we break up, I should be the one to leave. - But I don't plan to dismiss you! - Nor do I! - Who should I say was calling? - Who? I swear to you that sometimes I don't understand you. - The name of the girl waiting. - Laumary. I don't know her well. My mother! Sorry. Goodbye, Mademoiselle. I'm sure M. Clarence won't like this. I am M. Rousseau's fiancee. Pardon! Many apologies! There's been a misunderstanding. Anne-Marie, Mademoiselle is a friend. You have to pay attention. Come to my office. I confess, I'm bad with names. I say so because one day... Anne-Marie! Solange! I present Solange. My old Solange, my only family. Micheline... Lafaury. Daniel Rousseau's fiancee. - Good day, Mlle. - Good day. Oh... but! I thought she was alive! No... She is dead. I disguise her sometimes to amuse myself. It's an antique dress of Poiret. Pretty, eh? Precious. Give that back. Good... I want to talk to the managers and saleswomen. - Here? - Yes. It lacks nothing. - Hello. - Hello. - You slept well? - Yes, and you? - Me too. Good, let's discuss something. - And that is? The collection occurred to me at night... when I least expected it. You made this at night? Sometimes. Tell me, about Daniel... About Daniel...? Nothing. I don't know what I was going to say. Come in! Come in! Come in! I have to talk with my staff. - I'll go. - Wait! What do you prefer? I don't know. It's hard. The two are delightful. And right now? - The one on the left. - Good. - But... - I'll deal with the rest. - And my winter clothes? - Hell, that's right! We haven't taken measurements! Henriette, take charge of the matter. You'll model as soon as possible... To model, it'll be best to return. I'll tell them call on you. Where do you live? With my cousin Lesurque. Quai D'Orsay 22. - The boat guy? - No, the shipowner is his brother. - The other only has sons. Ten. - He can't have everything. Gilberte, accompany her. Micheline! Until tonight! What? Come with me, we'll take the measurements. - They're all here. - Good, here we go! - Are you busy? - Yes. - Then, until tonight. - That... - Where? - I don't know, dear. - I'm have a lot of work to do. - Good, I don't insist. Listen to me, my daughters! I've called on you to announce yourselves what I give to go back. The models created a month ago aren't worth it. Don't protest, because I agree with you. And I need you to like it because I know you. If you don't like it, it won't go well. Who has something to say? Nobody? - Mlle. Lafaury? - She's here, thanks. - Who is it for? - For Mlle. Lafaury. For Micheline! I'll take it. - I'll place it for you. - It's my underwear! So tell me how you want it. What old records you have. But I like them. I have the right, no? If you don't like them, don't put them on. - You haven't wasted any time! - It's a fashionable house. When did you order it? Three months ago, the last time I came. You hadn't told us. So you're working, Alain? Curious way to study for your exams! I've just sat down and I'm already leaving. You're incredible. You're incredible! Idiot! You were! You have nothing to do with the girls. If you want to arrive on time to the Pleyel House, get changing. It's tonight? You're coming? - Don't sit around! Prepare! - It's tonight? Clearly. Dinner reservations are at 7. And it's in less than 15 minutes. We'll leave to see to it. Aunt, if it's no bother, I'd prefer not to go. I don't want to. I wanted to go to the movies. Do what you want, darling. You are master of your time. Two workshops have worked for you for six hours. I've remembered what I wanted to say this morning. About Daniel... he's gone to Lyon, Philippe will serve as chaperone... at dinner tonight. I'll see you at Le Coq d'Argent. Until then. - Looking for someone? - Yes. - I didn't see you in the crowd. - That's our table. - You're leaving me stuck here. - I'll call you tomorrow, my word! - How many people there are here! - Some good friends of mine. - All of Paris. - It's the best place I know... to enjoy solitude. We are alone, abandoned, lost on a desert island. - I'll make distress signals! - Philippe! They don't care. Why would they do anything to us? - You called me? - Yes, you can serve us now. Pardon me, I asked without expecting you to come. Well done. I've already eaten. How was that? Very simple. I'll cut to the chase. Philippe, I'm a single woman. It's not a crime and I don't see the relation. At times, women have to play hide and seek to go out with men. Ah, I see what you mean! I had dinner with my cousins and they think I'm at the movies. Amazing! You've already deceived Daniel. I didn't believe it. Daniel left me alone. Yes... remarkable. Rodolph! - Champagne? - No, a fine wine. It's Antoine. A fine wine for table 43. Have it sent immediately. Alright. I have the appetite of a dog. Today I ate in the train. Good, eating gives you a lot to talk about! You have a table? Go all out with a table for two. It's charming. Aside from a defect in the shoulder, this outfit is delicious. How foolish, I haven't said thanks! There's no need. It was done very fast. It reminds me of a cocky guy. Better for a woman. I didn't dare go out in the street! I think it looks beautiful. Veal with sauteed peas, roasted chicken, or steak. Golden potatoes, salad, cheese... Here they have some exquisite Camemberts. You like Camembert? - Well, do you like Camembert! - To hell with Camembert! Who are you looking at? - He looks like your friend Clarence. - He looks like him indeed. You didn't look beside him? Doesn't that look like a woman to you? - You're also with a man. - What an idiot you are! You're nervous. I believe there's someone who knows you. Why would you say that? - She looks at you with much interest. - She's an old friend. - She's charming. - Yes... You seem antisocial. You should greet her. I don't need that! I'm trying to enjoy myself! You should imagine... - You should imagine... - Yes? Does she bother you? There's no reason. Evidently not. - They're making fun of me! - But what are you concerned about? Stay if you want! I'm going! - Antoine! - Monsieur Murier? - Fetch me a piece of Camembert. - Yes, Monsieur Murier. Understand, Micheline? The soul of a dress is the body of a woman. Will Micheline be back yet? Nicole, you're getting my wheel tangled up with yours! I do no such thing! They have returned before me. It was inevitable. Yes, it was. What was I telling you? You talked about your profession. "The soul of a dress is the body of a woman." I didn't understand a thing. You'll see... A dress without soul... is a dress that was created for nobody, that was not created for somebody: a woman. And thanks be to her. Sure... You can't imagine what it is to create! In catechism they speak of making something from nothing. What were they talking about? About God. The first day he created the sky and land. Ah, it's true! When will he return? Who? Daniel. I don't know. In 2 or 3 days. And until then? Until then, what? Will we meet again? It seems hard to me. I have to go. Call me. No, you call me. The quarterly balance is still less than 30%... than that of the previous quarter. This cannot continue. - What is the lower balance? - The quarterly balance. Ah, yes, I understand! And what is it lower than? The quarterly balance of this month. Of this quarter! - The last two balances... - Am I interrupting? Not at all. We'll see about this tonight. - No, tomorrow. - You told me that three weeks ago! - This cannot continue! - Tomorrow! Goodbye! I wanted to speak with you. Me too. I'll begin, if you'll allow me. I don't intend to be your puppet. Leave that for the others. And save your excuses. I know them all. 8 months ago you fascinated me. Now it's finished. It's finished! I know you well. You believe Poiret? You are incapable of putting out a spring collection now! - Ah, yes? - Yes. If you knew how to make what you want! But you waste everything. You waste your life and that of others. Although, as for what concerns me, sit down! - What day is today? - The 5th, why? No reason. What are you plotting? You could have more courtesy. A minute. I'm all yours. Let me see! It's my dress! The first that you made me! - I didn't know where it was. - Now you know. What a pig! I swear to you that... I knew it! Helene: 18 December 1940, 12 October 1941. Anne-Marie, this hasn't even gone yet! Marguerite... You're playing to the collectors? Monsieur has his museum, his small cemetary. Now I understand why you never forget the key to your cabinet. You're off balance, eh? You can press your teeth. It doesn't impress me. To think you'd left me to commit yourself to work... after hearing what you wanted me to think! - Finished yet? - Not yet. I've been cheating on you for three months. Go! The chubby-cheeked little fellow you were with last night? No, another one. What did you mean before? Goodbye, Lucienne. And good luck. You could answer my question. - What did you mean to tell me? - I have answered you. Goodbye and good luck! I don't know how you'll finish, but don't come knocking at my door. You weren't ugly. - Here we are. - Ahead. Who asks for him? It's for you. - Who is it? - Mademoiselle Lafaury. Wait, hold on! Okay, I'm here. What's up? I thought they'd cut us off. For peace and quiet, I've sought refuge in the Louis XV room. Er, I mean, Louis XVI. It's very pretty. You're working. Am I bothering you? By no means. I'm alone. I'm not doing anything. - I thought you had a lot of work. - Yes, but I lack the drive. I'm sad, and when I'm sad I don't want to work. Why do you laugh? I'm serious! Really? And why are you sad? - It's not important. - How so? I mean to say it pains me that you're sad. You're very kind, but my sadness has no remedy. You'll see, Micheline, I'm alone. I'm sure of it. I'm beginning to think I'll always be alone in life. Tonight I'll return to my house, I'll have dinner alone... Is it such a disgrace to dine alone? How does one do it normally? Surely you could take precautions. Yeah, that's for sure. But they are useless precautions, they don't work. I haven't always known it, but now I do. Since we parted last night. If I hadn't known, everything would have stayed the same. But Philippe... Nothing of "but Philippe." - Listen to me. - Yes. I'm responsible for many things. - This dress has remained well. - And I have nothing to do! It is neither his fault nor mine. I don't know why we speak of him given the circumstances. I'll say that. Know what you would do in my place? I'd have dinner with me. What? Pretty, no? Yes. It's an old song. I like the old songs. - You too? - Yes, me too. I especially adore this one. Life is stupid at times. Life is good. The fools are the people. They swim against the current when it's easier to give into the tide. Perhaps. Unfortunately, one must know where one wants to go. Where do you want to go, Micheline? Let me be, Philippe! The champagne should be cold by now. I'm not thirsty. And I should leave. Accompany me? I hope that the doorman has taken good care of my bicycle. Don't worry yourself. I always leave mine on the patio. Philippe, I beg you, leave me alone! That's all, M. Clarence. Thanks. I'll notify you when I've made my decision. He should be finished. I'll tell him you have arrived. I'll go. Leave it there. He's in the grand salon. Hell, Daniel! - You're already here? - Hello, Solange. - How quickly you've returned! - Everything was ready. I only had to go down to collect the fabrics. - You've brought the weavings? - They're in your office. Show me them immediately! One moment! What should I do with the models? You decide. Hire the redhead and the two last ones. Then there'll only be 8, and you wanted 10. It doesn't matter! You've got to talk to Solange. Come on, let's go! Has he told you what's going on with that girl? - What girl? - Don't play the fool. Lafaury. He doesn't give a damn! If you only knew! - You'd better of the house. - You only think of that. - You don't know one bit about what concerns me. - Poor Anne-Marie! You like that? Are you happy? It's exactly what you wanted! It falls like water and it's as smooth as skin. If your father were here, I'd embrace him! And this, what is it? This? - It's a fabric. - Thanks, so I've been told. What's up with you? You don't seem like your normal self. Oh, why do you say that? What's wrong? It's a fantastic fabric! I had brought it for Micheline's bridal gown. Did she come around here while I was gone? Yeah, sure. What happened? Nothing too bad. I had convinced her before I left... and we had set the date for the 25th. Now that I've returned, doubt sets in. She says that it's very rushed, that the flat is not ready, that her family isn't in Paris... And that's all? And that's all. What a fool you are! You know nothing of women! And you do? A woman is an extraordinary mechanism! A mechanism... no! She has some reactions that... You know nothing of. - Yes. - And what? Don't force her. Wait and tomorrow she'll agree with you. - You believe that? - I'm telling you that! - I leave you the fabric! - But man! What fur? No, no, I'm going! Forgive me, I have to leave. When will you send me the remainder? - Tomorrow or the day after. - Thanks! See how everything is working out! Mademoiselle Lafaury? Wait, hold on! Listen. I need to speak with you. Did something bad happen? It's that Daniel has returned. We have to see each other now. Can you meet me in half an hour? - Sure. - In the Tuileries? Why there? Because it's halfway between my place and yours, and because I want to see you as soon as possible. Very well. Next to the carousel. Does it bring back memories? Back in the days, I had a lot of fun. - How funny! - What? I can imagine what kind of boy you were. Tell me. You were very blonde, chubby, and you got angry when the hoop failed. I never failed! Clearly, you were already perfect! As you are now! - I was looking for you! - What's up? We've been expecting you for an hour! Come! Did you get home okay last night? Did you sleep well? You shouldn't have worn a necklace. Why? With these blouses it isn't done. There! Much better. It's ravishing! - How sad! - Why? I wanted to say that now that he has returned... we're going to have problems seeing as much of each other as we wanted. - Seeing each other? - Yes. Do you trust me? We are going to have quite a hard time. With the collection I am busy enough. Although it's not important, I'll start organizing now. To think you're Daniel's fiancee... and that's how we know each other. I promised myself I'd expect little to come of it. You weren't surprised? What did you think? Nothing or almost nothing. I didn't think about it often. I had thought I wanted to see him before he came back. I didn't have the nerve to say anything, but I'm going to do it, Philippe. You won't tell him that...? Clearly not. It would be useless. What are you going to tell him then? The truth. He's an excellent man, and in many senses, better than you. I'll tell him I esteemed him highly, that I thought I could love him one day, but that I no longer think so because... I will tell him I can no longer marry him. No longer marry him? Listen, Micheline. I like you a lot. I suppose you already know that. - What are you thinking? - Nothing. Continue. I don't think I've known another woman I like so much, but this is Daniel's matter. Continue, Philippe. But, does he not realize? Poor Daniel came to see me in a desperate state. The guy wants you! All women are the same! They cause suffering to the first man they know! - It's incredible! - The first man? I'm talking about Daniel! You can't do that to him! I am not the sort of man a girl like you can take seriously. Daniel wants you and you're his fiancee. There isn't any serious reason that you should not marry. Are you listening to me? And nothing keeps us from remaining good friends. My god! Listen! Perhaps it interests you? It's getting dark. They can't see well. Turn on the lights, Therese! Where were you? The championship has begun. - What championship? - Daniel's here. He's the referee. He asked where you were. - I'm going to put away my things. - No, come! - Here she is! - We've waited an hour! How you exaggerate! 17-16. No, 18-16. Pay attention, Daniel! 18? - Another round? - Yes. Are you going to win? It's not going to be that weakling! Do you want a slap? Who served? 18-16. You're after Michel. You don't kiss each other, lovers? You serve, Michel! I'll go. Silence! - The pig fumbles all his balls. - If you knew how to play, you would too. 19-16. Yvonne serves. You would be able to give me a kiss. You don't want to marry, Micheline? How? - 16-20! - Good, Yvonne! 21-16. Change. No, referee? Sorry. Two equal players. Yvonne serves. Mama asked Daniel if you have a date for the wedding. Daniel told her that you still didn't want to decide. You can play the femme fatale. You took the words out of my mouth. Leave her in peace. Don't pay her mind. She's jealous. As are all the spinsters. You're the spinster! Nicole! Hello, Micheline. Hello, aunt. You've written to your godfather for his birthday? - Not yet, mama. - Charming! He'll be very pleased! - Come with me to write him now. - Not now! The game isn't over yet! - Now! - Yes, mama. She told her twice already. Mama will quarrel with her. 0-1. You're going to lose, Yvonne. I'm tired. Listen, Micheline, we need to know the details. Because if we are going to be your maids of honor... and we want to have dresses, there'll be the matter of ordering them. That's true. You could be more considerate. Serve, Yvonne! Everything's about the wedding! So there aren't any real players? Michou... What's going on? Tell me! What's going on? She's nervous! We burden her with a date so soon! Shit! A taller figure, Juliette. To imagine modeling dresses on models whose... figures correspond to them! Besides, it's awkward! The girl has no chest! She has a figure but no chest! - She can't have it all. - Quiet! Did I ask for your opinion? In that case, better shut up. Dress No. 25 now! 33 in the next hour! Henriette! - Nos. 20 and 21 are yours, no? - And 22. Surely. Is it ready to fit? What does the gray wool dress need? - Almost nothing. - Within 15 minutes. Hurry. Is it going well? No, it isn't going well. I have four fabrics for tomorrow. Today is Friday. You have until Thursday to do half the models. - Are you serious? - Completely, Paulette. But you'll know how to fix them. Not another thing will be said here! Pass me the bar of soap! You told Solange that you'd be finished today. - I never said that! - It isn't so? - Yes. - Then, what can you tell me? I didn't tell Solange that I would be ready. It is finished by a miracle. Miracles are unforeseeable. - Take it. - And you? I have more! - Give me one. - Don't bother me! Go, you'll ruin yourself! - What a scare you've given me! - You will have spent 500 francs. - Why didn't you ask me? - Is this to thank me? Good, thank you very much. Is that it? - Today is your birthday. - What a memory you have. In five years, you have forgotten nothing. And I'm not going to start now. I expect that. You're charming. Idiot! - I'll bring you to Micheline. - To Micheline? Yes, you can't stay here! You promised to make her the dress! What dress? The bridal gown! We marry within a month. I didn't know, but I should have remembered it. - Then... - Then, what? - Are you happy? - Of course! It's amazing! - Beloved, you have my samples? - Which ones? - For the dressmaker. - Yes, sorry. You should put it with the hats in case she wants to reach us. With all we've come to expect! - She will finish before us. - Probably. - Until then, darling. - Until then. - But is that all there is? - You saw everything. It's for her. - In the other room is a good girl. - Indeed she is. - You've waited long enough to give us an update. - Let's see Micheline. - Monsieur Clarence will be with you shortly. - Thanks. - He's making a beautiful dress. - I hope so. You'll be a ravishing bride! I'll bring you the rare artist and go. I'm not such a fashionable guy. - I don't bother him? - You? Shall we sit down? It doesn't hurt. We have little to discuss. What a pity! You're a temptress. In full form. - Is he angry with you? - Me? Why? He didn't want you to do this. I couldn't tell Daniel that I'd go to another fashion house. He wouldn't have understood. I don't believe it. I want him to know that I don't want to see him when he tests me. If he doesn't understand, I'd like to run the risk of going to another city. - I asked him if it's possible. - All is possible. Will they be able to make me the dress without me seeing it? It's difficult, but it can be done. Thank you very much. Of course, I want to pay for it. Daniel won't know anything. As you prefer. Germaine! Come, heavens! Anne-Marie has left, so you'll attend to Mademoiselle Lafaury. A bridal gown. Show her the model for the next collection. I expect you'll like it. It's very much your style. Excuse me. I have a lot of work! I'm going to find the sketch for you. The model isn't done yet. It doesn't matter. I'll wait. Good... It's past the little parlor and let Juliette know it's starting. See you in five minutes. Micheline Lafaury's coming for a fitting. What a drag! I had forgotten. - Wait! - What? Not with the cheese knife. I remember the set you assembled years ago in that hotel in Chamonix... with a silver knife to peel the fruit! It gives another flavor, you said. And it's true. And your client? That can wait. We'll work. We'll start eating at 2:00. We'll be able to finish calmly, no? Take it! You can say that it's a pear lovingly cut. You keep Micheline Lafaury waiting! Micheline Lafaury! I've heard you already. I don't want you to make her wait! I don't want what the clients expect! I've said it hundreds of times! - Thank you, Philippe. - It's nothing! - You're a pig. - Worse for her! Why does she want you? Because she confuses love with things having nothing to do with it. A pear lovingly cut! I'd prefer never to eat one again! - You want to know what... - What? She just sees now in me what you have these past five years. You hadn't come back for that. This will end badly. I think the same thing, but you should understand... It'll be exhaustion that kills me, but I barely understand you. - Good afternoon! - Sorry. Hello, Daniel. And what do you want? - How unkind we are today! - There are days... Micheline is being fitted. - Is your collection ready? - I don't know. It's that... I bet it'll be a triumph. I hope so, because it's my last card. You have played your last card so many times! - So this is the last one. - Pardon! - And you, how are you? - Very well. - You're happy? - Happy? With Micheline? Fantastic, my man! We haven't been apart the whole day. I haven't time to go to the office. Really? How good! I'm very happy for you. Thank you. She enters! You aren't going to eat! He'll throw us out, as usual... with the excuse that he has to work, eh, Philippe? My dress is ravishing. I will leave them astonished. Surely so, is it true, Philippe? You awake? You were as good as gone. Tuesday, I won't forget! Understood, thanks. You're coming, Daniel? - Sorry, I'm exhausted. - You seem like it. Until later! Did you have to call me Philippe? In front of her? In front of her? In front of them. What are you doing now? I'm going to Avenue Montaigne. - You always have to do something. - I can't spend the whole day with you! - I have friends, cousins... - Yeah, sure. Sorry, you're not bothering me. I'm just nervous. Alright... If you want to come, we're expecting you. I'm Madame Solange. Good afternoon, Madame. I'm calling about the chairs ordered... for the presentation of your collection. I can tell you exactly. The last time they rented 250. That's about right. We need 300. That may well work, if you'll please. You can deliver them on... We present on the 27th... It's sufficient that we have them two days before. In six days. They go here. I'll tell you where to put the others. Hurry up, we're going to be the last ones as usual! - That will never change. - What will never change? In all the collections, the same thing happens. - We're always the last ones. - And so what? - They baptize Jacqueline's names. - When has that been done? Female names. - Berenice. - 42, Berenice. - Number 43. - Chimene. - 43, Chimene. - Number 44. - Iphigenie. - 44, Iphigenie. One moment! For the presentation I still have to add various names. Put them down on the list for notification by mail. We still have the complete list, right? I thought it was better to wait until it was complete. Why? Why...? What insanity! Now I'll have to send letters to them all! - No... - I wanted to avoid it! I didn't want them to know we were delayed. It's the drop that fills the glass! I can trust nobody! - It isn't so bad! - Yes it is! I'm very sorry. We gain nothing by this. Let's continue. Number 45, the last one. Esther. Then? Esther! - ¡Esther! - It's noted. Take it, Paulette! Thanks, Jacqueline. Until then! Good, Monsieur Clarence. Paulette! The last one with no variations. You're not the one who just spent three weeks killing herself. Don't bother yourself! We'll baptize your dresses. With foolish names as usual. Number 20! Antigone. Anti... what? Antigone. A woman who died a long time ago. Number 20, Antigone. Stay there, Henriette. Excuse me, Mademoiselle. - Are your dresses baptized? - Yes. I did the first one. Perfect. Goodbye, Mademoiselle. She's a temptress. Madame Solange is right. Isn't that true, Monique? I believe it now! What a beautiful bride! So, is it for Saturday? - What? - The wedding. - Ah, yes! - We'll see you out. Right, Madame Henriette? It's lunch time. Sure, you can leave. How friendly you two are! It's only natural. I hope I'll be in your place! And why is that? Because it's a beautiful day for a young woman. - Doesn't it feel like it? - I suppose it does. It's a ravishing dress. Thank you, Madame Henriette. - I don't deserve it. You can take it off now. We'll help! Paulette, return with seamstresses. Anne-Marie, notify other workshops. She orders the dresses very well. We expect you for champagne. The only thing missing! That won't do. Better to do three rows. - In the whole room? - Where you can. - Is that a dress from the collection? - No, it's Mademoiselle Lafaury's. This has been the final fitting. Tomorrow she'll pick it up. Who is it? It's me, Philippe. Come in. Good afternoon. My dress is perfect. Thank you very much. Certainly, can I send the bill along with the dress? I'll send you the check. It's in our pact, no? Micheline, I have to speak with you! Leave me be! You must listen to me. - Really? - Yes. I'm sorry, I have more important things to do... and surely you do too. - Don't leave! I have to speak with you and I will speak with you! - You hurt me. - Forgive me. But this comedy has lasted long enough. - What comedy? - You know very well. The secret visits, the bridal gown...! Our pact, as you say. You don't feel like you've kept to it yourself? And after you hurt me I'm obliged to hear that? - Be a good player. - I play nothing. I'm not like you, I don't act like I'm special in life. I am how I am. You don't understand me, and it doesn't amaze me. - A man like you... - What does that mean? Something very simple: who believes in nothing. I believe what I see! Up until now I'd only known women to be like... other women. Then came you... and I realized too late that something had happened. Something I had not understood. Very interesting. You speak as if our separation means little. But we separated three weeks ago, in the Tuileries. And for always. We haven't separated. I entered this room a moment ago... and you were not surprised. I've waited for you. Me? You're mad! Yes. I've waited, Micheline. Have you seen Monsieur Clarence? Yes, he's in the changing room with Mademoiselle Lafaury. He hasn't finished? I've just seen Henriette. I've said nothing to the contrary. Only that he was with Mlle. Lafaury. If you knew! - Jacqueline, hurry! - Is that still all there is? - We have not begun. - It won't be all. Yes! - Where is the boss? - He knows we're here and will come. - It doesn't seem like it. - You'll have to go and find him. I don't dare. An apprentice can go look for him. See to finding the boss and bring him! I don't dare! Don't discuss and see to it! All of this is very pretty, but the truth is simpler. I marry Daniel this Saturday in "La Madeleine." You can't, you're not in love. - I will be! - By god, Micheline! I have come to hate him! Are you sure? Listen. We'll leave at two. Leave? Tomorrow, or tonight, if you want. You would abandon everything? This instant? The collection, the house, all? All! All that isn't you! - Is the boss here? - Why? They expect to drink champagne. Tell them he'll be there immediately. What's terrible is that you're sincere. There are words that I have managed never to tell a woman. They've believed I loved them or not, but I've never told them so. I had to force myself to pretend because it was so difficult. But now I'm not pretending. I love you, Micheline. How many times have you said that? And to how many women? However sincerely. You haven't understood me. Never! Do you believe me? I believe you, Philippe, but... Were you listening to us? I know. For Daniel? This woman hasn't meant anything to me for a long time. Isn't that true? Tell her the truth! Leave her alone, Philippe! I know you're not lying. Now, go. It's better. Until tomorrow! The personnel expects you. - The personnel expects you. - What? You came to tell me that? Listen, Anne-Marie... Goodbye, Philippe. As you wish... - You're here at last! - I'm here now! What, is there a fire? No, but we've waited an hour for you. - How late it is! - So what? My supper! While I'm here my husband is busy making it for me! In the fashion world there are two solutions for the married. Being widowed or having the husband cook. Here he comes! I give you all thanks for your contributions. But I... I... - To your health! - And to the collection! To the collection! What's up with you? You're trembling. Come to my office. I have to speak with you. To your health, Monsieur! To yours, Mademoiselle. Labourvier! Labourvier! Have you still heard nothing from Anne-Marie? Nothing. I just called again and I couldn't get an answer. It's very strange that she isn't here on the eve of the collection. Try again. Come on up! - Take the money. - Leave it there. Has a sleeping car been reserved? Give it to me! Then... - You're still determined? - Let's not return to that. I wanted to remain good friends. If it was that important to you, you would do something about it. Like what? Rest until the collection has gone. Later it'll seem normal for you to go. You're tired, they'll believe you're on holiday... But rest until the presentation. Then it will work out. Impossible. She will believe that I've stayed behind. Try to understand it! She's a girl who sacrifices her marriage and her future. I sacrifice nothing. How so? And the house? It isn't little! It took 20 years to raise it up. A good gift you give her! She won't give you happiness. And I don't want her to. You don't like her? What has she done to you? I don't give a damn about her! She has time for sentimental complications, but here there are 300 who can't be permitted that, and who you are going to put out in the street. It looks like my say means nothing. Thanks, but all is useless. It couldn't be any clearer. Thanks, Philippe. Don't speak foolishness. And all this money? Oh, yes, how foolish! - How much is there? - 200,000. - Will it suffice or do you want my savings? - No, this will do. Hide it from others. So they don't see it! Now they'll only see bad things. What are you doing here? Don't put on that tragic face! Speak! - Anne-Marie... - What? Anne-Marie has died. What did you say? I just called the caretaker. She has killed herself. - My god! - The doctor said she died last night. - Has the personnel been told? - Not yet. Don't say anything yet, there will always be time. Monsieur Clarence will go to Anne-Marie's house. Leave us now. My poor Philippe! Are you going to Anne-Marie's house? I'm going. Goodbye, Solange. Where are you going? Ahead! Mademoiselle called me? Yes, help close the trunk. I can't do it alone. I don't get what's going on with it. - What a twisted trunk! - Well, it's very pretty. - Who is it? - It's me. Come in. Monsieur will help us. I was making purchases, I called my office... and my secretary told me that you had called. What are you doing? We tried to close the trunk, but we had to give up. - Thanks, Anna. - At your service, Mademoiselle. Leave it, it's not urgent! You could've been like that all day! A lock was closed badly. I understand. Thanks, Daniel. I don't understand anything. And all these suitcases? I'm going. Where? To my house in Reims. What? What has happened? We can't marry. That joke isn't funny to me. I have been with another man, Daniel. When? What does it matter? I have a right to know. It's been a month. A month? I thought I loved him. And you tell me that now? I meant to immediately, but I couldn't. Who is he? Do I know him? I'm disconcerted. You're very honest. How have you been able to keep quiet up until now? You can't imagine! I have tried so hard to forget! How stupid this all is! I'm not very sharp, but it seemed like something happened a while ago. I had the sudden impression that you had something to tell me. I waited, but it didn't come. Are you going to marry? Us, marry? I'll never see him again. That I can swear to you. I don't understand, Micheline. I can't explain it to you. At least for now. Further on I'll tell you. When I'm an old spinster. You'll tell me nothing. I don't want to know anything, now or ever. Stay. You're a great person, Daniel. You've told nothing of him to anyone? No, but we still can't marry. It's something finished that we won't speak of again. - Poor Daniel! - I'm completely serious! Ahead. Monsieur Clarence is waiting. Philippe! He falls out of the sky! Tell him to wait. How does he know I'm here? He didn't ask for the Monsieur, but for the Mademoiselle. - Where is he? - In the sitting room. - Tell him I'm not here. - Yes, Mademoiselle. I'm going. Anna, one moment! Tell Monsieur that I'll be down immediately. - It's him. - Calm down, please! Don't make a scandal. We're not in our own house. - What is he doing here? - He thinks I'm going with him. He asked it yesterday when I went to try on things. - And what did you say? - I said... - I don't have the time. Anne-Marie came in... - Don't continue. I don't believe you. He's here! Now let's see. You! You too? What's going on? He knows everything, Philippe. Good... I've come for you, Micheline. I don't want you, Philippe. I've never wanted you and I never will. It was a misunderstanding. What? A misunderstanding? I amused myself with you. To you it seemed funny to go out with a girl, but for me the curiosity was you. You aren't the only one who knows how to do comedy. Me too, when it's needed of me. But, Micheline! What has changed since yesterday? We were going to go together! You lie! I'm going to go, but alone. Now I'm completely alone. The wrong has been done. I'd like to hear just about anything spoken less than that. And much less by you! I want you. Leave me and go away! See yourself. Have you heard? Go away! Are you going to go? Are you going to go? What's going on? Answer me, Micheline! - But, what has happened? - Leave us. Please, leave us alone. What do you want? - What is this dress called? - Judith. It's ravishing. And M. Clarence? I don't see him. I haven't seen him either. Has he not arrived yet? Not yet. He must be late. - Has he heard? - What? Turn! That's it, go! - He liked them? - Yes. Better. - And the necklace? - I'll put it on! I'll put it on, my child! - I'll also take this. - Thank you, Monsieur. Thanks, my good Daniel. Pardon! Bah, now already! - Now's the time? - We only have five minutes. Only? Daniel, I have to ask you a favor. You know you can ask me whatever you want. Yesterday you saw Philippe's look. I only want to know that nothing has happened to him. Call him on the telephone and come back. It won't hurt to tell me. So I'll know that he's alright... I'm not asking you to tell me what you think. Do it, Daniel! I'm leaving in four minutes. You said I could ask you whatever I wanted. No, not that. Excuse me, Daniel. Clarence's house? Is Monsieur Clarence there? Hold on. No, it's no bother. It's not important. I only want to know if Monsieur Clarence is there. No, he's not in. Who's calling? But isn't he presenting the collection today? Yes, but Monsieur Clarence has not yet arrived. One second please! Hurry, the train is leaving. He's presenting the collection and they haven't seen him. Are you sure about that? Yes, I'm going to verify it. Hold on, please. - What's going on in the parlor? - It's marvellous. - Where's the boss? - Yolande, she's removing the coat! You'll celebrate without it. Monsieur Clarence didn't finish it. Where's the boss? - He went last night. - What? Be quiet! Yes? Someone asks for Monsieur Clarence. And what of it? He's not here. Or did you not know that? - I already told Mademoiselle, but... - Tell her to go to hell! Come, come, let's go! - Who is that? - A new saleswoman. No, Raymonde, not yet! The first gray tailor-made suit! Take it, I'll leave you the list. Watch them while I go to the parlor. Monsieur Clarence isn't here. I'm Monsieur Rousseau. Who's speaking? Who are you, Monsieur? I'll take it. Where is Philippe? I don't know. I haven't seen him since yesterday morning. You wanted to talk to him? No, no. It's not very urgent. Excuse me, but we're showing the collection and I'm alone. Yes, I understand! Poor Solange! I'm afraid, Daniel. The train has gone. Follow me, please. Come, hurry! Don't sleep! We aren't here to laugh. - It's started? - The wind is in the stern! I can't come in! 42. Number 42! Rosine! Get out of here! You didn't leave! What's going on, my child? Don't stay like that! They're looking at you! Give me the coat! Number 44! Berenice! Get a chair for him. What are you doing there? Get inside! Number 48, Hermione. Sit down, Monsieur Clarence. Bravo, Philippe. Bravo! He seems drunk! - Mother, isn't it marvellous? - Clarence is a great artist. And he's not applauded on the day of the presentation? - He'll be applauded in the end. - Who knows when the end will be? Because it all ends with a bridal gown. I didn't know that. Number 55, Aphrodite! 57, Roxanne! Hymenee! The collection has ended. Clarence, it's magnificent! Incomparable! Lucie, attend to the clients! I'll be back soon! - And what do I tell them? - That he's sick, tired! That tomorrow he'll be well! - Some story! - Do you understand a thing about it? I only understand that Anne-Marie is dead. It seems to have affected him. Where are you going? There are some clients who insist on speaking with Monsieur Clarence. - Tell them that I... - And M. Roland will not go without seeing him. - Forgive me, but it's that today... - Don't worry. Return next week when I'll have more time. Very well. And bravo again. What a pain not to be able to speak with Philippe. Forget about him, so that today... I thought about him when I heard that girl had died. Well, we're ready to go! - Who can I count on to be there? - And Monsieur Clarence? - Is he well? - Solange has gone to see. - What are you doing here? - We want to know. We're part of the house too. Answer me! It's me, Solange! Open up! What's happening? I don't know. This is absurd! Open up, Philippe! - Daniel, I'm going to talk to Solange. - I prefer it. I'll wait here. - Are you going to see the boss? - M. Clarence isn't here. Yes he is, Monsieur. He has locked himself in and won't answer. It's all your fault. Where is he? Perhaps the other door can be opened. Open up! There must be something to do. There's nothing to be done. He's dead. He looks happy. He's dead. He always looks happy. He didn't even break when he fell.
