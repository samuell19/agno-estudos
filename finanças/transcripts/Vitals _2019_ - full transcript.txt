Here we go. Oh, oh God, okay, okay, okay. Come on, Richard. Come on, come on. Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Hey? Hi? Oh come on, come on! Damn it. Oh, no. Oh! February 24th, 1997. My name is Jonathan Parks, and I've been abducted. I'm from Des Moines, Iowa, and if you find this, I'm probably dead. Find my wife. Read her this message. Her name's Margaret. Her phone number is. Jane! Oh, thank God! God damn it! Oh, oh God, oh yes. Oh please, please. Richard? Hello? Hello? Oh my God! Richard! Richard! Oh my God! Oh, oh! Oh! Oh God! Oh God! Hello! Hello, help! Help, can anyone hear me? Hello? Is anyone there? Hold on. Where am I? Oh God, oh God. Where the fuck am I? Oh God. Oh oh oh! Okay. Oh oh! Richard! Richard! Okay. Yes, yes. Come on. Oh no! No! Richard? Hello? Is someone there? Jane! Jane, is that you? Richard! - Oh Jane! - Oh thank God, Richard! Are you all right? Are you hurt? Oh Richard, thank God. Jane, we've been taken. They cut me open. What. I patched myself up. I took some pills, your prescription. I've got your purse. My phone, my phone is in the purse. I know, there's no signal. Are you all right? I'm a little bruised, but that's it. Did they hurt you? No, I was drugged, but I'm okay. Did they, did they touch you? No, I'm pretty sure. Tell me about the incision. Oh, it's about two inches to the right of my navel. About six inches long. Sounds like a kidney. We need to get you to a hospital. And how we gonna to do that? I don't know. Well, when you figure that out, you let me know. You need to lie down. Is there anything in your room that can help us? I don't think so. Richard lie down. In a second. Describe the items that you have in your room. Richard, there's nothing here. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I'm not an idiot. You have to listen to me. Look, you may not know that it's useful. Just tell me what you've got in your room. Stop it. You always do this. I am not a child. I'm not calling you a child. I'm trying to get us out of here. Thanks for thinking I'm too stupid to realize that. I didn't call you stupid. It's me with the MD. Now who's calling who stupid? You attack me. You always attack me. Well, listen to me you fucking shithead. Unless you lie down, you'll tear something and cause internal bleeding. Do you hear me? You'll die! I got a signal. What? I got a signal. Hold on, I'm getting us out of here. - Operator. - Hello, hello. Help, I need your help. My wife, my wife and I were, Richard! Hello, hello! Hello? I lost the signal. Damn it! Are you all right? I blacked out. I told you stay down, don't try to walk. What did we do? I don't know. What's the last thing you remember? Ah. We went down to the lounge to get drinks. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. Now? You're going to start in with me now? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? The last thing we talked about is how you've been cheating on me the last two years. I said I was sorry! What else do you want me to say? Sorry? Sorry? Sorry that you cheated? Or sorry that you told me on vacation? Okay, look, can we talk about that some other time? Because I would very much like to get out of here. Thank you very much. Oh God! Let me see the incision. There's nothing we can do about that right now. What did we do at the lounge? I don't know. We ordered drinks. What'd you use to cover it? Uh. I ripped up some sheets from the bed, and I used them like a bandage. They left you on the bed? No. They left in the bathtub full of ice. At the lounge, do you remember anyone suspicious? I did get the wrong drink. Oh, that's right. You ordered a Mojito and brought you a Margarita. You think they drugged our drinks? They must have, Oh God, oh! Richard, you have to get back into the ice. I'm not going to be able to hear you from the bathtub. Yeah, I know. You have to go. Richard. Richard, we're being watched? What's going on in there? We're being watched. There's cameras in the ceiling light. Wife found the camera. But I feel at home... I hope she doesn't break it. Those things are expensive. Hey, what's a four letter word for a double reed Instrument? Any letters? Yeah, blank. B, blank blank. Oboe. The same hunger. You're so lovely, my dear. How did you get so good at these? I watch you, my friend. Ah, me! You started doing them, I started too. Okay! How much you think we can get? I dunno, 150. what's our commission? 15. I met him on the plane from Miami, Mr. Depp. Made a pretty couple. Oh no. This is an odd picture of you. What? This is an odd picture of you. What picture? Jane, whose phone is this? It's mine. I bought a burner phone for the trip. I lost my phone last time we went away, remember? I didn't go with you on the last trip, remember? Who'd you call? It was a day trip to see the Shanto Magos Temple. You were planning a day trip? Yes. Together? Yes, together! I figured it was something you'd like to do. Anywhere, but here. We're gonna be okay. Let her go, let her go! I'll do anything you guys want! What do you want, money! You idiot! Guys, please, try not to damage the merchandise. These two are worth a considerable sum. He attacked us. What are we supposed to do, lie down like dogs? Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm not the enemy. You jump to anger too quickly. You need to learn to contain her emotions. I'm supposed to just let him kill me? No, I'm saying be careful. To me, their lives are worth way more than yours. You dare say that to me? Oh no. Are we really doing this now? We're in the middle of a job and instead of doing yours, you're preventing me from doing mine. You decide. You're dead. Are we done playing childish games? Can we get back to work? Really? Use me as a human fucking shield. You men, I'm gonna need more from you. Get the surgeon. I need you to stop worrying about what you think is important and start focusing on what I think is important. Are they secure? Do you need help? They're secure. Good. Let's move her to the other room. Can you believe him? He should watch his back. That's what I'm for, to watch his back. Come on. One day, I'm gonna get even. There is no getting even. It's not a fight. He was right. You need to wait until the job's over. You too, huh? Before you get all up in my face, I need to let you in on something. What's that? I will fire. Go, I'll be right there. No, come now! It's only gonna to take a minute. Nah, this ain't gonna happen. What, you wanna get in first? Huh, be my guest. I can watch. Get back. I'd like to see you make me. Why'd you go and do that? That wasn't the plan. Fine, we can make it work. Mr. Kaliya. Ah, Doctor, right on time. I must protest, Mr. Kaliya. Kaliya, it's Kaliya. What seems to be the problem? I can't do this here, in this room. You can't do it here or you won't do it here? These aren't the right conditions. So, you're new to our organization, so let me explain how things are going to work from here on out. I know you're not used to these conditions, but just know that your glory days are behind you. You don't work in a big, fancy hospital anymore. You work for me. You had your chance, and it was you who threw it all away. My family. Yeah, I know, I know. You'll do one or two of these and that'll get you back in the swing of things. Then you'll be used to it. Before you know it this'll be old hat. How do I know my son will be all right? He's fine. He's completely fine. He doesn't even know anything's wrong. You make us proud, we'll reward you. You disappoint us, we'll take something away. He's innocent, please. I can't go through that again. Listen, I don't mean to upset you, but we hired you to get a kidney and the heart from this man. We're a little rushed for time. So if you could What? We never discussed a heart. It just came up. Uh, we found a match, so... I can't do both the kidney and a heart. Why not? I don't have the tools. The heart will suffer. I can do the kidney. Here's what you're going to do. First, you're gonna get me the kidney. Then you're gonna go and get the appropriate tools and then you're gonna get me the heart. I'm not asking you. I need both. I don't care how you do it, just do it. If you develop a conscience and refuse, well, then we're gonna have a problem. Do we have an understanding? Yes. Good, 'cause Philip here deals with misunderstandings. It's just that I don't know if I can do the heart surgery. I mean, my hands, I... You live with that shame, not us. You're here to do a job and if you don't do your job, it's gonna cost our organization a lot of money. The problem is, what if he dies before the heart surgery? Then he's pretty much useless to us, isn't he? That's why he won't die. Look, I don't know... You're trying my patience, doctor. I can see this is going to be a good relationship. So many things in this world are done in a half-assed manner. People don't take the time to really master what they're doing, but you, you still care about your profession. Our last surgeon didn't have the care the patience to do any of his work properly, mm mm mm. What happened in the last surgeon? He botched too many jobs. He cost our organization so much money, ha. Doesn't have the care that I see you have, though. Thank you for your confidence. Don't let me down. All right, 3000 off my debt? Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 1500. But I'm doing two surgeries! One man, one surgery. It was you that wasn't prepared, so let this be a lesson to you. All right, can you help me get a shirt off? Uh, if you can get him into the bathroom on the tarp. Vessel? What? A container to put the organs in after they're harvested. Vessel. If this all works out, Doctor, maybe we can convert this motel room into a real operating theater. I just wanna make sure you're completely comfortable. I'm gonna leave Carl here. Good, good, I can use a hand. He's not here to help you. He's here to watch you. Can you handle this? Yes, I can manage. Do you have any family? Are you a fan of opera? Do you know Carmen? You know, I used to be a married. My wife is dead now. She was the love of my life. Her name was Carmen, just like the opera. Why are you telling me this? Helps me to concentrate. You know I used to be a real surgeon in a real hospital? I was the number three cardiac surgeon in Mexico. He took my hands. Takas. Do you know him? He was the head of the Cali cartel until you took him out. Brings in his son Lucas to the hospital demanding that we operate right away. He even shot my nurse so that I would know he was serious. His son was shot and was bleeding out. He died before I could even open him up. Takas went crazy, he started shooting up the place. He shot my hand, effectively ending my career, and then he brought my wife in from outside the hall, made me watch while he shot her in the back of the head, execution style. She died instantly. He destroyed my life. That's why I contacted you guys. Boris Alexi Takas paid for his crime. Well, you know my story, what about you? All right. When will I love you. Good Lord. I don't know, maybe never. Maybe tomorrow, but not today. That's for sure. This libretto is based on a descending chromatic scale followed by the variance of the same phrasing, first in the minor key than the major key corresponding with vicissitudes of love expressed in the lyrics. The opera ends with Carmen dying in front of her loved ones. Oh, Carmen, my Carmen, adore. Okay, chest. All right, you're gonna give me a hand. I've got to put him back in the tub. Richard? Shit, Richard! What? I found a vent. What? A vent, a vent by the bed. Right. If we can open them up, you could give me the cell phone. I'll probably get a reception in here. Do you have anything in there to take off your side? I don't think so. Just use a dime, a dime ought to do it. I don't have a dime. You don't have any spare change in your pockets? Richard, what part of I don't have a dime don't you understand? It's just you have a tendency to answer without checking first. No, no dime! I'm sending a dime through the vent. Got it. Okay, okay, I got it, it's open. Okay, I'm gonna pass it to you. It's working. Oh, thank God. It's ringing. Police services? Oh thank God, please help. My husband and I were on a resort, and we were abducted. They've taken his kidney. He needs a hospital. I'm here to help, miss. Do you have any idea where they are holding you? No. Can you describe anything about where you are? I'm locked in a motel room. It looks old. My husband is in the room beside me. The windows are boarded up. The windows on the room are boarded up. Are there any identifying items anywhere in the room? No no, the place looks abandoned. Ma'am, there are hundreds of motels. Is there anything else you can tell me? Uh, I don't know. We're on a highway! Oh yes, yes. We are on a highway. I've heard some trucks outside. How frequent do you hear the trucks? I've heard a couple. What are your names? I'm Dr. Jane Carson and my husband is Richard Carson. What resort were you staying at? Richard, what's the name of the resort? The Akiri Sansa resort. It's the Akiri Sansa resort in Goa. I know it. What phone or you're calling from? My cell phone. You say you were abducted and you have your cell phone? Yeah, yes, yes. My purse dropped. It was overlooked. And obviously you're getting reception where you are? Yes, very little. Alright. Mrs. Carson, listen carefully. If we're lucky, they already got what they want from you and your husband and moved on. What I'm going to do is to trace this number and contact the American consulate. Okay. We will do our best to get you out of the situation. Please hurry, my husband needs a hospital. I'm just going to just put you on hold for a second. Don't hang up. Richard, they're doing a trace on the phone. We're gonna get out of this. We've put a trace on your phone. It turns out that you are 250 kilometers away from your resort. The nearest town is about 45 minutes away and the nearest emergency services 75. I've already dispatched help. After we hung up. I need you to leave your phone on so we can continue to trace the signal. Don't worry, we will be there as soon as we can. Thank you. Richard. Richard! No please, wake up. Richard! I'm sorry. So sorry. You think this is easy? You know how hard it is waking up next you every day, knowing what I know, knowing that I'm half to blame. I can't help it. Every day, I look into your face. Can't you you see how this is killing me? You say you want to make it work. I don't know if it's too late. You stopped calling me sweetheart. First noticed it in a phone message. You were going to be late. You were wiring the new movie theater complex. It was the biggest job your company had landed, and you wanted it to oversee every little thing, but when you were going to be late, you'd call, and you'd apologize and you'd call me sweetheart. One night, you called and you didn't say it. I thought you were just preoccupied with the job and when it was over we'd go back to normal, but, we never did. You never called me sweetheart again. That was two years ago. I thought we were just growing apart. Then you got careless. Didn't even cover your tracks. I just ignored it. I took extra shifts at the hospital. I pretended everything was all right. People ask me about you and I'd, I'd tell them about the latest project you were working on. I talked about you so proud. Inside, it was killing me. We didn't talk about it. It's my fault, too. I let it go on for two years. Two years. Without a single sweetheart. It's amazing how one word can just change a person's existence forever. I wanted to hear you call me sweetheart. Richard. Thank God. They must want to keep me alive. What do you mean? Well think about it. They put us in a motel room with locks on the doors. That's too far to walk for help. So if I woke up and I wandered off, I would surely die. And then there's the ice here. They wanted to bring my fever down. They want me to survive. Why else lug in all that ice. Jane, they're coming back for us. What? They're going to take something else. No. They must've heard us arguing at the resort. At the resort? Yeah. Look at us. We made ourselves targets. We show up to a foreign country, and we were throwing money around like we're big shots while people in this country starve. We argue about our first world problems while they're making a dollar a day to serve coffee to assholes like us. They see everything. They hear everything. What does a kidney go for? 5000? $10,000 Probably feed a family here for a year and here we are flaunting. They see you. You're beautiful. Fit. We both are, we're fit, we're healthy. They can only assume that our organs are in top condition. We were targets the moment we stepped off that plane. Never apologized. For cheating? Yes. I'm sorry that it had to come to this, that we had to get abducted and I had to get butchered for us to actually be talking about it. Stop it. What do you want me to do? Nothing is ever as your fault is it? Jane. I'm bleeding again! Richard, move. I need to see. Richard, I need to see. Take them off. Okay. There's massive internal bleeding. He must've clipped something. If we don't fix that right now, you're gonna die. We don't have a lot of time. I need you to listen to my instructions very carefully. Richard, we have to get in there and fix the incision. Cauterize whatever he did wrong. What the hell's the point? We're gonna survive this, Richard. Even if it's not together. We're gonna get through this. What do I do? We need to cut you back open and get inside. Oh, that's not gonna happen. Richard, if we don't do it, you're gonna die. Okay, in a matter of minutes, we have to. How do I do that? Remove the stitches, drain the blood, somehow cauterized the wound and stitch it back up. Are you fucking kidding me? Richard, you have to do this. All right, all right. Okay. Okay, is there any codeine left? Uh. One. Take it. Okay, okay. In my purse, there's a sewing kit and some tampons. We're going to need something to cauterize, can you jury rig something? Okay, yeah, good. You're gonna need something to bite down on. Oh, oh. Okay. Okay. I got it. Listen to me very carefully. You need to thread the needle first. If you don't do it now, you're going to be in so much pain, you're not going to be able to do it later. Okay, there should be some plastic thread in there. Don't use the normal thread. It will tear through your skin like a fish hook through flesh. It's clear. Okay, I got it. Okay. Thread the needle. Don't forget to tie it off. All right, now take the nail clippers, cut the end of the stitches where the knot is. Cut along all the incisions until they're all severed. Okay. Okay, here goes everything? Okay breathe. Breathe, Richard, breathe. We can't have you passing out? Okay, good, good. Grab the tampons, use that to clear the blood out from the wound. Okay. Okay, all right, now here comes the hard part. You should be able to see where the blood is pouring out. We have to cauterize that location, burn it closed. It's not gonna take a lot of heat, but it's gonna hurt unlike anything you've ever felt. Oh God, I hate you! Richard, Richard! Damn it, Richard! Okay, okay, did you get it? Okay, good, good, okay. We're not done yet, we have to sew you up. I can't. Okay, put pressure on it. I can't. Come on, stay with me. Come on, hurry. Do a cross stitch. Okay, it'll keep the wound closed. Come on, Richard, you can do this. Stay with me, just a few more stitches. It's too much. It's too much, I can't. Focus on my voice. You can do this. You fucking bastards! Okay. Okay, okay, okay, did you get it? Yeah, oh my God, oh my God. I'm so proud of you Richard. Okay, okay. We gotta get you into that tub. Okay, the ice is going to bring down the swelling and your fever. Come on, come on, Richard. Richard, don't pass out. Get into that bathtub, come on, come on. Okay, good. Good, Richard, good, okay. You're gonna stay in there until the police come. I love you. Hello, Adventure Excursions? Kaliya, I need to speak with Kaliya. There is no Kaliya here. I was supposed to call for a man named Kaliya if I needed something to be taken care of. I was supposed to call it eight o'clock sharp. I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. Hello. Mrs. Carson. Doctor. Sorry, Dr. Carson. Before I go into my sales pitch, there's something I need you to understand. It's not that I don't get why people want to kill each other. I just feel the need to inform them that there are other ways. You're both adults. Have you tried therapy or a puppy or something? What? You'd be surprised at how many people change their minds based on that statement alone. Me, I wish somebody gave me options before I got into this line of work. I like to extend the courtesy to my clients. This is the chance to change your mind. No, no, I want to do it. Okay, very well. We can help you with that, but before you go down this road, you have to understand that there was no going back. This is not a game. There is no undo button. Do you understand that? Yes, I do. All right. I don't need to know why. Just the particulars. The three W's, who, where, when? My husband, I need it done sometime before our vacation is over. I was gonna order a day trip to the Shanta Magos temple. Maybe we could get it done there? I'm gonna walk you through how this is going to be done. You cannot show any connection to me or my organization. Okay. Did you bring a burner phone like I directed? Yeah, yeah, I'm using it now. Good, did you bring 5,000 American? Yes, I have it in an envelope. All right, go Look to your left. Hand the envelope to the man in the hat. Done. Got it. Good. Okay, now that you have your money, how do I know that going to go through with it? I don't know what else to tell you except you're going to have to trust us. Do you want a receipt for your taxes? No, I get it. Now, do you have a photo or some video of your husband? Ah, yes, on my other phone. You know what, just take a photo of yourself and send it to us. When you and your husband are out and about, we'll take care of everything. You should be getting a text message now. Send that photo to that address. Okay. Now just go about your vacation normally. Okay. Now, Dr. Carson, if there are any complications or questions, do not call us. We'll send you a text message. Got it! All right. Doctor Carson. This should be the last time we talk. All right. Kaliya, I need to speak with Kaliya. This is Dr. Carson. Dr. Carson, I thought I told you never to call. Something has gone horribly wrong. We were on the resort and we were abducted. We're being held. They're going to kill us. I know our arrangement, but I don't know who else to call. I need you to help me. Nothing's gone wrong. This is all part of the service you paid for. What? This isn't what I wanted. I never agreed to harvesting his organs. Call this off. Dr. Carson, you know I can't do that. I made that perfectly clear. I've changed my mind. I don't want to go through with it. The gears are in motion. It's too late. How much? Dr. Carson, unfortunately the people I do business with, they've already made arrangements. You weren't supposed to torture him. This was supposed to be clean. I remember making no such promise. Dr. Carson, I run a business. I'm fulfilling several clients' needs at once. I already have bidders for your husband's organs. You were suppose to kidnap him and kill him. It was supposed to look like an accident. Why am I here? Oh, well that's all part of the story. See, if you go to the police about your missing husband, a suspicion will be raised. You'll be brought in for questioning. You're not a strong woman, Dr. Carson. You'll be put into situations with the bright lights. Ah! you'll reveal who I am, what our organization is. I won't, I swear. Yeah, you will. But if you and your husband are both kidnapped and through a sad turn of events, your husband dies, but you somehow miraculously escape. Huh, that's a different story. Yeah, you'll be drugged and bruised up a bit, but you'll be above suspicion. They'll still ask you questions, but they won't be looking for that lie behind your eyes. This is sick. No, no more sick than you hiring our organization to dispose of your husband. I don't want to go through with this. What do I need to do? You don't understand. Your husband's organs have already been sold. People's blood types have already been matched up to his. He's going to save lives. Ha, you know that scene in the movie where someone's dying, and they need a heart transplant and one shows up just in the nick of time? Oh my God, that's us, that's what we do! We show up just in the nick of time! You're taking his heart. It's worth $100,000. We have people ready to purchase them. I'm not talking black market either. I'm talking about hospitals in your good old US of A. The chief surgeons bid for them. We've even sold several to your hospital. Dr. Carson. St Paul's. My hospital. We do our homework. We can't take the chance that somebody will change their mind and then talk to the authorities. I can't go through with this. What do you want me to do? This isn't a game. Dr. Carson, you called us! I made the terms absolutely clear and then you agreed to them. I didn't agree to watch! Ah, that's an unfortunate circumstance. Wait, is that the only reason your changing your mind? Did you find somebody else to pay off that huge gambling debt of yours? From what you told me, if you don't pay it off, you're as good as dead. I love him. It's a little too late for love. It's never too late for love. That's a beautiful sentiment. I think you should spend these last few hours with your husband thinking about all the reasons you love him. At least you'll have that. I'm sorry, Dr. Carson, I can't help you. Hello, hello, hello! He woke up. Yes, he woke up. You didn't give him enough sedative. What happened here? He ripped his stitches and he and his wife had to put him back together. They said it was internal bleeding. He opened himself up and soldered his own wounds shut. This does not bode well for you, doctor. My God, the poor man. He's alive. Must've passed out from the pain. I still expect you to deliver what you said you would. I did deliver. From where I'm standing, if it wasn't for the quick thinking actions as the wife, we'd be down a heart. I'm sorry. If you can't do the job then we will find someone who can. No, I know I can do the job. You know what? Maybe it was a mistake trusting you with this in the first place. No, no, I can do it After all, it was you who came to us to dispose of the man who killed your wife. And for that, I'm grateful. It was you who couldn't pay off the remainder. If you have $10,000 on you right now, you can leave. I don't. Crimes of passion are the worst. People never think about the consequences of their actions. How many more before I'm paid off? We'll tell you. But if you botch this operation up like you did the kidney, you'll have cost our organization more than you can afford. I understand. Oh good, I'm glad we have an understanding. Can I get Carl to help me? I mean, this is very difficult to do. I want you to look at today as Christmas Day and you're a kid and in front of you is a large present. Except if you break this present, you're gonna pay for it with your life. I don't envy the position you're in. May God have mercy on your soul. Please, he's my husband. You caused this. Please. I've got my own problems. You gave an oath. Once. I'm not a doctor anymore. Hardly even a man. You don't have to do this. Why did you help them fix my mistake? You knew he was just going to die anyway. He's my husband. I didn't want to see him suffer. Well, you prevented nothing. I can pay off your debt. You won't be able to. Neither of us'll be alive long enough. This is the way the world ends, Dr. Carson. Not with a bang with a whimper. Just as long as I saw Boris Takas dead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's who I hired to kill my husband. You're working for the wrong people! You foolish woman. It was who I was put onto, the Cali cartel. Then why did you try to save him? They are torturing him in front of my eyes. I don't want to see that. I don't hate him that much. What, so you just had a change of heart? That's right. I was given Takas's, number and he put me onto Kaliya. I had to pay them $5,000. Then why kidnap you? Apparently it puts me above suspicion to the police. They've played you, Doctor, just like they've played me. You think that you're paying off your debt because they've killed your arch enemy. You're just working for the same man. I work for. Alexander Dobrez. No, no, they lied to you. You've never even questioned it because you were so blind with revenge. You're wrong! Think about it. Did you see it happen? Do you have proof? Hey, you're here to do a job. It's done. How do you know? I have proof! Yes. Give him to me. Hello? What are you doing? The heart. Why would you listen to her? She doesn't know anything. Is it true? Of course it's not true. Is it true? I want you to listen to me. You are there to do a job. If you don't want to do it, you pay. Do you understand? Yes. Now hand me to Carl. Yes. Go into the other room and kill that bitch. Yes. I'm sorry. This is bad. Shut up, Philip. What are you going to do now, motherfucker? This changes nothing. We've already made a phone call and another surgeon will be on his way. This time, I'll make sure he kills you. Let's call this off. Let's end this. Mr. Carson, you know I can't do that. What you have is way too valuable. Oh fine, then I'll just kill myself right now. Yeah, you do that. You know we have your wife as collateral, right? She can easily step in and take your place. I'd like to see you try that. I've got a gun now. Mr. Carson, we know you have no more bullets. So by my calculations, you've done nothing to prevent the events of today from happening. In fact, you've helped us. That surgeon, I didn't really trust him. He was too desperate. We have a replacement on his way here now. You've lost. You should just accept your destiny. What's your name? I'm not gonna tell you my name. Oh, come on. I'm all bled out. I'm next to dead, and you're still too much of a coward to tell them in the name of my executioner, It's Kaliya. Well, fuck you. Kaliya. You are excellent and Resourceful man, Richard Carson. Under different circumstances. I would want to know you. I think you're a piece of shit. I can totally see why you'd think that. I've already called the cops. You want to play with the big boys? I own this town. You think you saved yourself? You just managed to get a couple of cops killed. They're gonna be here. You think this is some kind of game. I will kill you and rip your fucking throw it out and then I'll do the same for your wife. You're a monster! Only compared to some. You would kill an innocent man and his wife. It was your wife that did this to you, Mr. Carson. Oh, that's a lie! Oh, I'm lying, I'm lying, I'm a liar. Listen, I'd go willingly if you just let her go. You're in no position to bargain. Do you know who's getting them? What? Come on Kaliya, who's getting them? Your heart is going to a man with a family of four. He won't know where it came from. Tomorrow, he'll get a phone call from his doctor telling him that they found an organ donor and that you were in a car accident and that your blood types are a match. He'll get to see his children grow up. Your kidney, that's going to a woman who, for her entire adult life, has been on a dialysis machine. You'll be giving her a new lease on life. To these people you'll be a hero. They sound like good people. The kind of people that, if they knew where these organs were coming from, they'd rather die. You might be right, Mr. Carson, but people turn a blind eye. We use a licensed harvester and nobody knows the difference. Richard, what did he say? It's gonna be all right. Said he's going to let us go. Really? Yeah. We've already brought too much attention to him and his organization. He doesn't want that. The cops'll be here in a few minutes. He can't risk it. Really, he's going to let us go? Yeah. That's great. That's great, oh my God! What are you doing? Nothing. Hello, you marvelous bastard, you. Richard, when the police come, everything will be different. I want a real marriage. I want to start over. I know. I know. I know, I feel the same way. But what about your debt? No, it doesn't matter. We'll make it work. You know, we'll sell the house. It doesn't matter. As long as I'm with you, that's all I care about. There is one thing I need to discuss with you, Jane. What is that? Exactly how much was my life worth? What? How much was the pay out? How much did you pay them? How much am I worth? Richard, you got it all wrong. Do I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're paranoid. You know, I can understand after all that you've been through. Can't even be straight with me, huh Jane? You're in shock, okay. You don't know what you're saying. That Kaliya piece of shit, he said that you hired him. His number's on your phone, Jane. It's on both of their phones, and it's on your phone. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, exactly how much is my life worth? I owe money, Richard. More than I know? Close to a million. How? The stock market. How much is my insurance policy worth? Richard... How much is my insurance policy worth? A million dollars. Well, that's fucking great! How much did you pay that asshole Kaliya to kill me? Five. 5,000? $5,000, Jane? Everything we were, thrown away for 5,000 fucking dollars. I know, I'm sorry. Our mortgage payment's more than that. I know. That God awful statue in the front hallway is worth more than that. I know, I know, I'm sorry, all right? I'm such a fucking idiot. Listen, I would do it differently if I could, you know. I tried to change his mind, and he wouldn't have any of it. Take my place. What? Take my place. Go instead of me. Uh, the police are almost here. Come on, you created this mess. You are the only one who can change the outcome. Now take my place. And if they don't show up, show me how penitent you are. How much really love me. Take my place. No, no, no, no, no Richard, it doesn't work like that. Why not? You are just as good a candidate as I am. Pick up the phone. Call him and tell him that you want to volunteer instead of me. Haven't you've done enough damage? Stop it. You fucked up, Jane. You hired them. You got yourself in debt. You made this marriage fail, and at the end of it all, you're the murderer. No, no! Dr. Carson, I grow tired... Take me! This is highly unusual. Oh, just just, just take me, just take me instead. Do you want me to talk you out of this? Is that what this is? Fine, think of the future. If your husband dies, where does that leave you? Dead as well. I am offering you a chance at a different future. There's only one logical outcome to this. Just hang up the phone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see. Hello. Margaret Parks. You don't know me and what I'm about to tell you may seem very hard to believe, but I need you to listen to me very carefully. If this is some kind of prank, I'm really not in the mood. No ma'am, no, this is not a prank. My name is Richard Carson. I'm from Syracuse, New York. I was on vacation with my wife in India, and we were abducted. I think they're coming back for us so they can harvest my organs and sell them to the highest bidder. They already took my kidney. If this is this is some kind of joke, I'm really not interested. Please, please don't hang up. This is not a joke. The reason I'm calling you is because in the room they're keeping me, I found a note from your husband, Jonathan, dated 1997. Jonathan. Is Jonathan your husband? 1997. That was the year he disappeared. He uh, he left a note asking me to contact you. How can you be calling me if you're being held hostage? I managed to get a phone. Look, I don't have much time. They're coming back for me. I need to read you something. Call the police! Get some help! Oh, I did, I did. They're on their way, thank you. Now I need to tell you about your husband. Do you want to hear the note he left you? Yes. Margaret, I fear the last words that ever came out of our mouths were curse words and then when I stormed out of our room, I never thought it would be the last time we saw each other. I want to tell you that I'm sorry for everything and that I never stopped loving you. I was taken by some men and I don't know what they want from me. I know I won't survive until morning. Oh God! I want you to know that my last thoughts were of you. I love you. That's all it says. Thank you, Richard. I. I don't know what to say. Jonathan was a lucky man then, to have someone like you, someone to leave a note behind for. Mm-hm, We were on vacation. We were pregnant. I was just about to tell him, and he lost money in the casino. I yelled at him. He didn't know why. I didn't want him to keep wasting money. That's the last time I saw him. I needed you to know the truth, Margaret. Goodbye Margaret. Richard, what are you doing? Oh! Richard, talk to me. I'm gonna do it. Go to hell. I'm gonna take your place. It's too late, Jane. You can't. I will. Richard, do you hear that? We're saved. We're in here! We're in here! No, no! No! Oh my God, oh my God! Dr. Carson. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I now need your help. Wow, that happened. I need you to perform the surgery. What? See, you're a doctor. I'm sure you have a better idea of what to do than me. No. I'm not asking. I won't. Oh. Oh, it's okay. It's all right. That's all right. It's all right. I understand. It's so much. It's all right, it's okay. There's already been so much death. Mr. Carson, don't do anything stupid. There's no reason to upset the flow of things. Prep him for surgery. No! Do it! Hurry. Come with me. Dr. Carson, do this for me and I'll make sure nobody finds out it was you You can have a whole new life. One million dollars, Dr. Carson. How many more until I'm done? We'll tell you. What's an eight letter word for a breach of loyalty? Betrayal.
