The National Institute of Audiovisual Communication presents Do you remember Lourquin - the filmmaker .. when he was talking about old age after his last film ? Well, he said : "I'm not going to make any more films" .."after all, I've said everything .. I don't need to film anymore..." .." I can finally savor the calmness of a tender and serene existence without worrying about my films" That's what he said -Politics have worn these men. - .. and cinema as well! [ Indistinct conversation in Arabic ] - Good Morning - This is Laszlo. He's an old friend. Pass this to Omar. [ Indistinct talk ] Ok darling, I'm leaving. Liberty at Night It came to you during moments of misery or due to love to avoid starving to death. That's why you know how to do it. Because, at a certain point, success became crucial just to get out of the cold and that's why as well.. your arm didn't tremble because there was no material means to do it otherwise. and you'll be capable of doing this your entire life. Then, it'd be better not to move I chose to become a puppeteer Well, what do I see here ? Mm ? - You're gonna have to do the voice of Alice. - Alright. On my mark, ok ? I'll take it from the top. - Well, what do I see here ? - The first thing to do is to recover my normal size. Secondly, we must find the path of the marvelous garden. I suppose I have to eat or drink something .. but what exactly ? - But, who are you ? I don't know .. for the moment, I know who I am when i woke up this morning but I believe I've underwent multiple transformations since - What do I say here ? - "What do you mean ? Explain yourself." - But, what do you mean ? Explain yourself! - I can't explain myself because .. you see .. I fear of no longer being myself. Ok, that's good. Hello Jean, take a seat. Ok, you'll say your lines with a lower voice - Everything ok ? - Yeah We're working.. You see ? It's Bouboul .. a caterpillar - The last time I saw you, I told you that we were going to found a movement And well, it's done. I don't know where I placed the pieces of paper. - You're still in, right ? - Yes, of course. - You'll see .. you'll thank me for having done this. The kid's at school ? - Yes, Jean. - How's Mouche doing ? - Mouche .. Yeah, I saw her a few days ago - She's doing well. She says hello. What else did i want to say ? I don't know anymore. - You can sleep here if you want to. - Certainly - It's true .. I forgot, I'm with artists. I have to go see Andre - How smart are we .. we don't live together anymore. I thought it'd be best if we separated. - Yes. - As much as we loved each other .. we have to seperate I admire you And I think I got you into some difficulties I'll always be glad for having known you. Before I met you ... I didn't think love existed. If I hurt you without knowing it .. You'll have to forgive me.. and not blame me.. I'm not Freud .. I was reading his books I guess this is it .. we're no longer together. It was the most difficult ater all It saddened me that you sold the house I stayed a long time with you to put order in my life. I realize the difference of the people that surround me at this point .. and you. Sometimes, it's hard to live like this. But I drifted away into another world, so it doesn't affect me a great deal. - Don't you want to reconcile yourself with me ? - Yes, but not right away. - I don't want to be alone - You know .. Mouche and I .. we're probably going to separate. The kid will stay with me - You're not going to perform your guignol at Lyon ? - If we go back .. yes. - Because you'll be able to contact someone .. I'll give you the address. My god, I'm crying now .. and in front of my children. Knowing that someone still loves me comforts me. I've lost you completely now. I've only got one shirt and a torn pair pants. I was so ashamed that I didn't even come to see you or apologize to you.. knowing the problem you've got. - No - I feel that I'm in touch with you.. and with the Sophie as well who's very sensitive. I fell hard. Nobody can detach me from my dreams and the images in my head Love counts the dead hours... Don't be sad. Don't be sad! You be nice to your dad. The ferryman of dreams There are still some things that we haven't talked about I dropped by the apartment to fetch the mail There's nothing important. Have you made many changes ? There was rubble everywhere. New residents .. everything from scratch. The workshop has disappeared all of this is very sad. Do you lack anything ? No, nothing .. except you. It's making me cry now, Jean. When I lost my father before meeting you .. I .. I .. - Good morning. - Good Morning - Here you go. - Ah, you brought me this book. You're nice. - I came to see what you'll do with these things here. There are identity checks everywhere .. it's very dangerous. The police tortures people like you for a lot less than this. - Yes, they're aware of that. - Do you know where Jean is ? - No. They don't know either. You look desperate. - If you see him by any chance, please don't tell him anything. I brought you these arms to defend yourselves. no one should know about this .. especially him. Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - Your father told me that you wanted to see me. - Yes. Khatem has disappeared and Salah has been arrested and they've cracked the skull of Khatem's son. The police here is worse than the army over there since De Gaulle's arrival. We have to see each other soon .. at 7:00 Ok. - Good morning - Good morning Sophie. Goodbye. - You should run for the presidential elections - You're crazy. Nah, I love my job and I have a daughter to take care of since my separation with Mouche - You love your daughter very much, don't you ? - I have to meet Mouche downstairs. - Why didn't you tell her to come up ? Oh .. you know .. our lives are separated now. Are you two having fun ? Keep my daughter company .. I'm going to see her mother. The Game of Mouche - Why are you shaking ? - You know .. I do this .. for ideas. - You know a guy called Jean Pavoulesco ? - No We went to take his office He should've been minister of culture at the unitary government. Have you ever killed anyone ? I don't know .. I once shot an Arab, but I never found out if he survived or not. In any case, he never showed up again. - They killed Mouche ! They're crazy ! Stop the car here ! Everything ok, kids ? Come my little Sophie .. come. It's all over now. I wanted to ask you to explain You're my friend after all - Yes - Well then, I want to know what Mouche was doing with you Why was she taken down ? - Obviously, you know it's my fault. She took some risks with us .. it's war. What Mouche did was .. she made war with us. - What did she do with you ?! - Look, you're my pal .. but I can't tell you. It's underground. It's of no interest .... Jean ! Jean, come back ! Shit ! I want to know why Mouche was killed. I'm going around, asking questions But, it's leading nowhere. When De Gaulle came, he saved us .. but I wasn't aware of his new scientific theory of torture... It's my daughter who's the real victim here. Now, leave me be .. I don't want to know anything anymore. And you child .. pay attention to this story People like me and your parents were assigned during the Algerian war to aid people resist the invaders Racism .. caused 1 million deaths with it's sinister war of conquest We've seen populations consent to these crimes and take this bellicose turn which belonged to our old enemies. We believed that we'll never see the end and a lot of our own died while fighting for freedom. And that's why, child, we are still scarred by this atrocious war. If I thought of you while you were little while writing my book... of you for example .. Barthelemy and Sophie .. who are oh so wise and intelligent .. is because such horrible things should never happen again .. war in our country The power to which you obey these days in different countries is a result of peace .. and we chose it. When this power starts functioning properly .. we'll be long gone .. but well.. Nobody else knew how to make it work Your turn will come one day when you will decide to maintain it .. for peace to exist. The Inkwell of God. - Oh, excuse me .. I thought that no one was around - Good morning - I'm going to do some housework - I love doing nothing while someone is working He didn't tell you when he was coming home ? Andre .. that is. - No .. I don't know. Andre is my buddy. He didn't tell me that he had a maid. You're Spanish ? - No, not really ... well, sort of .. I'm from Algiers. - Algiers ? You were there ? - Yeah I chose to live in France. - You're a Pied-Noir, then. - Yes. - Umm .. do you need anything ? - No .. I don't need anything. - What's your name ? - Gemina. - Do you think you can sleep here ? - Sleep ? - Yes. - What's this scar ? - Oh, it's nothing. I'll tell you - I'm afraid of the extended year. - Since Mouche's death .. this is the first time .. - Mouche ? .. my wife. We were already separated. - She died of sorrow then. - No .. she was killed by the Special Organization - They're in Paris as well ? - Yeah, they are. You didn't hear the explosions last year ? Ah .. i thought it was just some people celebrating. In Algiers, they always say that in Paris people are always celebrating And why did they kill her ? Was she Arab ? Mouche in Arabic means .. cat - No, she wasn't Arab .. but she was helping the Algerians. I too ... helped the Algerians. I helped the National Liberation Front. - You were my friend then. No. - Why did you help them ? - For justice. - .. and now what do you do ? You still help them ? Now .. there's peace. Now .. you're going to love me ? Maybe - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come. You're coming ? I live here.. - Why are you laughing ? Because my necklace got stuck in my stockings. I should get going ... I have a little daughter. She's 11 years old. 12! She's 12 years old. What do you do for a living ? I'm a teacher. You can go if you want to .. - Goodbye. - Why didn't you come up ? - I love you. I despise myself so much when I accept that people who have contempt for me to talk to me .. sometimes .. my entire self becomes disdainful.. but .. I .. I love you. [ Indistinct words ] .. to finish with nostalgia. You won't betray me ? No .. why would you think that ? I don't know No .. I won't. I want you to take care of me ! You're not taking care of me. You should protect me .. I want you to protect me ! Come Jean ! Shit ! Gemina Why did you leave ? Where were you ? I told you everything .. everything that was in my heart How could you think that it wouldn't hurt me ? I told you that I love you .. that I'll go with you .. I gave you everything How could you think that it wouldn't hurt ?! You gave me money .. you helped me .. but I don't want that I want protection .. tenderness .. i want you to caress me .. I need that What I feel is .. that there is no future .. it's such a shame, that's all. I love you .. other than that. I love you. We're going to stay together and then live together But you're not going to leave, right ? It's nice when you console me
