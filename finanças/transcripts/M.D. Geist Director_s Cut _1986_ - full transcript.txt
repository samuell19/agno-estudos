In the age that proclaimed the end of the Christian Era... Mankind began advancing out into space... spreading its seeds across many star systems. But, the characteristic flames of humanity's wars... were not extinguished, after all. Even on this planet, Jerra... You bastard! The new generation of humanity is the Nexrum, who oppose the rule of the Earth Government over all the planets. Hoping to contain the Nexrum, Jerra's regular army wages war. Neither side yields a single step. While their offense and defense see-saw back and forth, the war situation becomes a quagmire. Little Elephant to Black Box... 13 km to target. Dropping to low altitude, on schedule. This is Black Box, we roger that. Good luck. You're too high. Bring it down. Roger. How long do we have to wait? I'm ready for some action. I don't think there's anyone left alive out there. Maybe the ghosts will come out. Don't talk that way. How long are the pilots going to keep us shut up in this coffin? Relax. Once the fighting starts, you'll miss this flying coffin. What's that? M.D. Geist: Part of the regular army's elite troop of special manufactured soldiers. Based on the theories of biocloning, they possess fighting abilities far beyond that of normal man. But Geist's method of fighting proved to be too ferocious. It was decided that his very existence posed too great a danger, and in Jerra year 843, he was imprisoned in an orbiting satellite. Also known as: M.D. GEIST Who are you: Coming down from the frozen sky Who are you: Silent sky won't answer me Battle weary, still you fight on Mission in an unknown land Long forgotten man, a strange and fearful warrior Nobody knows: Memory is torn asunder Nobody knows: Racing on the wind's aura Drinking in all, all that it sees From the cold and darkness you come Who are you, who has awakened... tell me Can't stop: He's just a soldier Can't stop: We awaken and we see There is nothing left of our tomorrow Can't stop: He's just a soldier Can't stop: The never-ending war game On the horizon... battle is on Chasing you Looks like someone's been playing with fire. You're dead, moron! You should have stayed in the army. Not bad. Who the hell is that slob? Get your stinking hands off of our stuff! You scum wouldn't even know how to use it. I'm the only one here with the skill. Marsh! Stand back, Marsh. I'll handle this. You want the armor? I like that, you've got balls. But we killed him, so it's ours, not yours. Want to live? You got two choices: You can join my gang, or you can beat me in a fight. Fight? He must be joking! He doesn't know about the boss. He must be insane! Who cares? He'll be dead meat in another minute. - Rules? - Just one: Kill. You bastard! Stop! All of you together still couldn't take him. You're pretty good. He was tough, but not even close to your league. You want the suit? Take it. You need a place to stay? Come with me. I've been waiting a long time for someone like you. Vaiya! He just killed the boss! Shut up! I was worried about this all along! That idiot was always starting trouble. I always figured he'd get killed by another gang. But you're the real thing! Become our boss, and you could have anything you want. I even have contacts with the army brass! The Nexrum Army? Both! I work either side of the fence. Tell me everything, and I'll consider it. Really? Sure! I'll tell you anything. First question: What year is it? The year? What? I just want to know how long I've been napping. Nothing important. Vaiya's brains got us out of some tough spots, but this time I don't get it! If she hadn't stopped us, that bastard would've killed us all! Together we could take him. Hold on. She's got some kind of plan. Or she wouldn't have tried so hard to fish him in. And what if she's planning to stab us in the back? Betray us? Then we'd have no choice... Nexrum finally tested their battle armor. Their power suits are the best. The regular army is all but gone. Enough of that. I'll bet you haven't had a woman in a while. Don't look at me like that. Is that your name on these tags? G-e-i-s-t. It sounds so strong. The regular army... where are they based? Oh, who gives a damn? Geist! You're wrong. All I want from you is what's in your head. I could care less about the rest. Don't say that. You make me ashamed. Get out of here. I'm done with you now. What are you doing, you impotent bastard! I won't let him get away. He's got something other men don't. He's strong enough to protect me from Death itself. It's big, Geist. You got lucky. But you'll get nowhere helping the regular army. They wouldn't be chasing the tank unless it was undermanned. The weaker side is desperate. They'll pay more for help. What if they don't have any money at all? Nexrum's too strong! We can't beat them. That's the signal. Are we really going to fight Nexrum? If we don't, that bastard will kill us. Same thing, either way. Engine #2 is overheating! Put in more coolant! Left side treads are sluggish! Don't slow down! I verify 4 Powered Machines on our flank, 3 behind. The rear center appears to be the command unit. Persistent little worms. Where's the rear gun? We need more firepower! We have too many wounded. We're losing coverage on the guns. Hans, maintain speed until I return. Yes, sir! Maintaining present speed. We'll be in close combat soon. Prepare the Fightechs. All hands, maintain your posts! Idiot! Does he think that's going to save him? Forget him! Get the tank! Yes, sir, beginning my run! What? Stop it! Dammit! I'm not going to die for that asshole! Serves you right, you bastard! We've got to stop! The engine's going to blow! Colonel Crutes! Where's the Colonel? What is he? He's incredible! What was that? There's a Powered Machine on top of the bridge! Get me a Fightech! I'll knock him off! No time, sir! What? It's Colonel Crutes! Damned vermin! Now, army boy, we talk price. My men are expensive. I have to thank you, Mr. Geist. You helped the NoahGuards out of a tight spot. I originally served in the regular army. It's an honor to fight again. Let's skip the chitchat and get to the point. You're not military. Who are you? Geist's manager. You've seen how good he is, so now you have a decision. About what? His price! Don't play dumb with me. So that's your game. Forget it! We never asked you to fight for us. Don't give me that crap! We saved your butts! You can't push me around! Shut up, you hyena! We fight our own battles! We don't need scum like you. I'm a hyena? Yeah, I live off dead men. But who made me that way? You, the army! Your damn battles have killed almost everyone on the planet! And the few who aren't dead yet are left in a living hell! If I'm a hyena, then you're a demon from hell! Let's go. We should have let them die. What's wrong, Geist? Crutes... Ovild Folgain Shtrime. Are you just going to let him go? I am. He's far too dangerous. What do you mean? You saw his dogtags? He's an MDS. MDS? You new recruits probably never heard of them. When the war started, everyone feared the Most Dangerous Soldiers. Perfectly trained for all forms of combat. But they were too good. The army decided they should be discontinued. But we need his skills for our mission. I agree. If he joins, it would certainly end our morale problem. The troops already treat him like their savior. Sakamoto is right! This mission is top secret. I won't repeat it, so listen closely. This is our strategic headquarter: Brain Palace. As the war turned against us, we prepared a final program. Our mission is to invade Brain Palace and deactivate this program. Its name: Death Force. Death Force was to be our final retaliation: A doomsday device. It reacts to all life forms, attacking indiscriminately. At activation, millions of robotic soldiers will coverJerra. Ten days ago, President Ryan was assassinated in Sandorea Garden. At that point, Brain Palace entered the final phase. We have 11 hours and 45 minutes before the program is enacted. The NoahGuards will attack head-on. We have Fightechs for Hans, Lester, Jack, Sakamoto, Mr. Geist, and me. The six of us will head for the control room. Our final target is here. Still at it? I always seem to find you in some back room like this. You really are the real thing. More than I ever hoped for. Together, we could do anything. With the money from this job we'll be rich. We could go far away. You could learn to listen a little! Dammit! Vaiya. I hate to say this, but we're going to leave you now. You see, we've talked and decided to get the hell out of here. We've spent too much time just trying to stay alive. Take care, Vaiya. Five minutes to Brain Palace! Alert condition two! Constant duty has worn them out. If they stay like this... What's wrong? Snap to, men! You look like a bunch of enlisted grunts, not Fightech Commandos! Let's go. Direct hit to the bridge! Get to the central tower! Sakamoto! Don't stop! You want to die? Pull yourself together, Hans! Hans, hold on. You'll make it. It doesn't look that bad. Colonel... You and Mr. Geist have to get to the control room! They're all dead! Again! No, you killed them! Farewell, Mr. Geist, or I should say, MDS? You're a bloody war machine. This place will be a good tomb for you. You said that when you left me on the satellite, too. It's no coincidence that you happened on the NoahGuards. It's the will of God that evil should be destroyed. The universe is an eternal battlefield for me Never, never, never: It goes forever The pain and suffering I can hear in that melody Come on, come on, come on: You, can never return It's the only crazy game It's the only foolish game Just awakening, you can't possibly see You must be the... Dangerous: Most dangerous Raging fire of violence Dangerous: Most dangerous The warrior who has left his land of birth It's the only crazy game It's the only foolish game Never stops until, it all ends in destruction Dangerous: Most dangerous Raging fire of violence Dangerous: Most Dangerous The warrior who has left his land of birth Program D now terminated. Brain Palace now returning to normal operating condition. Long Tom to Sphinx, the operation is a success. Hans, Lester, Jack, Sakamoto, John, Louis, at least your sacrifices were not in vain. And a great evil has been eliminated from the world. You did it. Why? Why... Geist! You killed the Colonel. Everyone's dead, above. I hid, so I was safe. But all that matters is that you're alive. Geist, what? Hey, Geist! What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop joking, the battle's over! Program D now active. Code 303. Begin Death Force. The game's not over yet. It's just beginning.
