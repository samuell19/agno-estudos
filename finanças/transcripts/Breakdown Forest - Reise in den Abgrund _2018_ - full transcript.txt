(BRIGHT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) LEON: Evil lies within us all. But how you handle it, determines what kind of person you are. I wanna be a good man, but first I have to win the biggest battle of all, to consign my enemies' future into the dust of history. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (THRILLING MUSIC) (EXPLOSIONS BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN SHOUTING) (MEN GRUNTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) (MAN GRUNTS) (GUNS BLASTING) I want a machine gun at the front there! You two head to the West flanks! - Get moving, get moving, go! - Yeah! (GUNS BLASTING) We need to hold the position. Don't let yourselves get pushed back! (MAN YELLS) (MORTAR BLASTING) You okay there? You tired already? Look like it? 11 o'clock. (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) (MAN SCREAMS) (MEN SCREAMING) (BOMB BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GRUNTING) That fucking Schröder, then we'll have one. You three, you come with me.

(GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (GUNS BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (PIN CLATTERS) (GRENADE HISSES) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (GASPS) This is not your game, okay? (GUN BLASTS) (GROANS SOFTLY) When I was a little boy, I used to always ask my father, "Why do people kill each other?" And his answer, a scorpion came across a frog on the banks of a river and said, "I can't swim, frog. "Could you carry me across to the other side?" The frog said, "I'm not stupid. "If I swim with you on my back "and you sting me, I'll be dead." The scorpion replied, "I'm not stupid either, "and if I did that then both of us would die." The frog said, "That makes sense so hop on." And the frog started swimming with the scorpion on its back, but in the middle of the river the scorpion stung him and the dying frog asked, "But why did you do that?" "Well, I'm sorry," said the scorpion. "I couldn't help it, you see, it's my nature." And both of them drowned. The list is excellent. You really managed to gather all the frogs of this Earth in one exciting playground, and so I'd like to drink to all the scorpions in this room who have learned how to swim. With respect, Breakdown Forest is not just some game. It's only purpose is to find the perfect subject, an organism that is ready to shed all of its dignity in order to become a superior being, a homo novus. Outstanding. So let us instead drink to our eugenicist poet.

What has it gotten you? Do you think those three little stars on your uniform make you special? (SIGHS) I didn't wanna tell you, Leon, but I only stayed because I pitied you. You're gonna be alone for the rest of your life. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) This is Abe Rhoder. 23 years ago, he was on a special ops in Afghanistan and went completely haywire, and 27 civilians were killed. Since then, he works alone, as an assassin for the highest bidder. Erwin Mayer. He was abducted with his bodyguard and his driver. He was supposed to be executed tonight. And I could tell you when and where. What do you say? Where do I find this Rhoder? (DRAMATIC CRACKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) MAYER: If you kill me, somebody else will take my place. And I'll kill whoever comes after you too. So here we have Huey, Duey, and Louie. Limousine driver, bodyguard, and Erwin Mayer. (LAUGHING) Yeah, you look better on TV. How many people have been murdered for high-ranking assholes like you, huh? Now listen very carefully, if anything happens to me a lot of people will be after you. You know what you're getting into? RHODER: Ah sure, but that's nothing new for me. Why are you doing this, damn it? How can you be so cold? That's how I stay alive, and besides, there are certain people who've paid me a lot of money just to send assholes like you to hell. Just like this! (RIFLE BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) MAYER: You psycho, what the fuck are you doing there? Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang! Bang bang bang bang bang! Cha cha cha cha cha cha, guitar! (LAUGHS) See how easy it is? (SNIFFING) Ah. Must be a pig nearby. A policeman, asshole! - Oh ho! - Put your gun down, Rhoder! The entire compound is surrounded. Special units, snipers, the whole program. So put your gun on the ground and let these men go now. MAYER: What are you waiting for? Okay. (SIGHS) Fine. You win, pig. So. Now I'll put my toy on the ground like a good boy. Hands up! Put your hands up now! (CHUCKLING) They're up, you see? You arresting me for fair dodging? How about mass murder or kidnapping of high-ranking state officials? Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. My God, do something now! Mass murder! Fucking high-ranking - state officials! - He's killed my driver. Do something already. - Did you like the music? - Last warning. Down on the fucking ground! No need to be rude. My God, why don't you just shoot? What are you - waiting for, pig? - Just shoot now! Get down now!

Papers, IDs, driver's license, it's all gone. Why that stupid look? Stunned by my beauty or something? I'll tell you now, it's the middle of butt fuck nowhere. Look around you, man. Like I had a fuckin' blackout. My brother had bought a new bike, real great shit. Newly imported from the States. Him and I went out for a ride and then I woke up here. Bet it was damned organ traders. Check if you still have both your kidneys. Flunitrazepam. Flu, what? Amnesia and nausea indicates something like Rohypnol. You a fucking cop or something? No, but I know a bit about drugs, and someone dosed me with it. Oh, someone dosed you with it. And who's this someone then? Got no idea. Got no idea. But whoever it was will be sorry. Hey, hey, hey, you're alone here. Where you goin'? Tell me, what do you think about Jendriczek? WITOS: He fulfills our requirements. He loves confrontation, has no impulse control, and he loves guns. Let's fill you up, my pretty. (GUNS BLASTING) He's one of my top candidates. How did you get him? (ROCK MUSIC) I'll fuck the guy who screwed my bitch. Contact customer service, maybe they can help. (RIFLE BLASTING) You got a gun, huh, you think you're a real man? I'll tell you something, you're not a real man anymore, at least that's what your wife says. With me she even squeals. My bitch doesn't squeal! (RIFLE BLASTING) (MAN SCREAMING) WITOS: We caught him after a little spree in a grocery store. I didn't see anything. Listen, just just up okay? You're my hostage, go. What's going on? Drop it! Excellent. I'll kill you all! You dickheads. You even know where you're going? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey, wait a second. What was that about the drugs, huh? Did you slip me that shit, huh? Why would I have? To rob me or something. (GRUNTS) Cut your shit. Or what, you're the fucker who drugged me, aren't you? It was you? (MEN GRUNTING) Shut the hell up! I didn't drug you or bring you here. Listen to me, if I let you go, you have to calm down. You got it? We'll find a way out together, can you do that? Can you do that? (MEN GRUNTING) (RIFLE COCKING) MAN: Come on, try it. CLAUDE: What have we here? Just some wildlings. Who are you? We could ask you the same question. CLAUDE: We are strangers in a strange land. I thought I was all alone with this asshole. No one is alone here, or do you think the world revolves around you? We share an enemy and we share a destiny. That means my problem is now your problem, kid. And your problem is now all of our problems. But if you become a problem, I have the solution here. - (STAMMERS) - All right, all right. I woke up here, I have no idea what happened. I can hardly remember a thing. Like my memory's been wiped. Hey, you have to be quiet. We don't have much time. If my brother finds you here, he'll definitely try to kill you. Here comes Claude. About time. Did you find anything out? No, sadly not, but we have brought a couple of newcomers. Ta-da, ta-da! Wait. Wait, stop a second. (GUNS BLASTING DISTANTLY) These are gunshots. (GIRL GROANING) - Who's that shooting, huh? - You're hurting me. I don't give a shit! I'm sorry, now who's that shooting? Elias. I tried to stop him from shooting somebody. There are others like you. When we arrived here, there was another boy and he was called Samuel. We have to find him and join him. Why should I do that? Because he can help you. Sophia! Sophia! I really have to go now. If my brother Elias finds us talking then... And then what? The thing is that our mother sent us here because she said that only wealthy people deserve the right to live. Huh? What kind of shit is that? I know she made a mistake but I think I can trust you. (CARTRIDGE CLATTERS) Hey Leon, we'll head out in five minutes. Claude said we shouldn't stray to far from the group. If Claude says so. Where'd you get all those weapons from? You'll have to ask Claude. I want this back, okay? We share a fate. Tell me, where does all the gear come from? Oh, I can tell you that. There were four uniformed men. They were armed to their teeth, and they attacked us, but we managed to overwhelm them thanks to come cunning. If it weren't for Claude, they would have gotten me. - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - Huh? What the fuck was that? A woman by the sounds of it. (WOMAN GASPS) My God. - Are you all right? - Don't you dare touch me! We have to help her. - Of course. - They abducted me. LEON: The guy's still wriggling. I mean, it's good for us. Oh no. As you can see, she stabbed him several times. And you know as well as I do that after that one isn't particularly talkative. Carefully, I'm Dr. Froelich. Can you remember anything at all, dear? Your name, what's your name? (WHIMPERING) I'm... Elsa. Damn it, where am I? - Help me! - Look at me! - (CHUCKLES) Sexy. - Help me! Help me! I woke up here as well. You can trust me. Don't be afraid, everything will be fine. (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) Hail and greetings, Doc. Fair maiden. What kind of people are you? Hmm, calm down. We don't want to hurt you. You woke up here too? So there might be even more abductees. Abducted? What, why would someone do that? I mean, for what reason? Yeah, I think that's what we need to figure out. And so let's lay all the facts on the table. All of you know how to handle weapons and I'm sure you didn't learn that in Sunday school. Now everybody raise your hand if you've ever broken the law. Everyone, go ahead, don't be shy. No judgment here, you can all be honest. All right, I admit I'm a dealer. Now what? A dealer? So you're a croupier now, are you? Bite me, man. Hey, so you're a drug dealer, we get it, okay? Hmm, and you two are totally innocent little angles then I'm sure. (THRILLING MUSIC) Hey! (THUNDER CRACKING) Hey! (GROANING) Come on. (FOOT SMASHING) (GRUNTING) MAN: What do you want from us? (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) Hey, we didn't do anything to you! Get down! (MAN GROANS) (MEN GRUNTING) (GUNS BLASTING) Here, take this. Shh, you have to be really quiet now. I can't let them hear us, understood? (SIGHS) Why the gas masks? No idea, but if there was something in the air we'd have already noticed. Their kit and their weapons are all thrown together. They're not soldiers. None of it makes sense. (GUNS BLASTING) Go on, go go go! (GUNS BLASTING) (RIFLE COCKING) Where'd he go? Drop it, drop it now! Shoot him, - shoot him you asshole! - Shut the fuck up! Don't be stupid, just drop it, drop it now! Stop it, stop it and I won't hurt you. So what's your name then, huh? Samuel. And you, I want your name. What's your name, man? Nikolai. What's this shit? How old are you? We're 17. It's just the two of you? Yes, we were four but we. But what, man? The others are dead! What was your name? Samuel? Wait. Sophia tole me I had to find you. You know how to get outta here so you'll help me to get out, is that clear? (BIRDS CAWING) MAN: He didn't get along too well with our little jungle adventure, huh? Wait, there might be booby traps! (LAUGHS) Ronny. You watch too many action movies. Vincent, come with me. And you, keep a lookout. He's dead, just like the others. Hmm, ah, his skull's been smashed in. Doc, can you and I talk in private? Yes, sure. Do you have a minute for me too? Yes, of course. My dear, I'll be back soon. Come here, look after her! What's going on with them? No idea, man, but I have a real bad feeling about this. Hey, what do we have here? Nine millimeter. The guy must have defended himself. There was probably a second guy who came and caved in his skull. Yes, I think you may be right. What were you doing? Try searching his bags, maybe he has some ID - or something like that. - Oh, yes. Let's see. No, he has nothing at all, not even a library card. Did you know that the human body is 70% water? What? - You're scaring her. - Huh? You didn't know that, Elsa my dear? You little liar! MAN: Leave the woman alone, asshole! Leave her alone! - Hey, hey! - Hey! - Hey. - Guns down. - Hey. - Back down, all of you. Last warning. Shut up, you fucking dickhead! MAN: Let the woman go. - You're so pretty. - Hey, hey, hey. You're an angel of death, now a dead angel. (GUN BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (RIFLE COCKING) (RIFLE BLASTING) Let them run, they won't get far! (GROANING) The Trojan Horse, a truly wonderful tactic to bring maximal pain and suffering to one's victims, Claude Germar Wishnewsky. Wha, what kind of people are you? Living ones. - Just kill him right now! - No! He doesn't deserve euthanasia. To see him suffer like this is a deliciously refreshing appetizer. But the main course, well, that's still on the run. (THRILLING MUSIC) (PANTING) (RIFLE COCKING) Did you hear that? One wrong move and I'll shoot your head clean off. Get up slowly, very slowly. Don't make any mistakes. The people who were with you, who were they? They helped me. Now they're all dead. HASSAN: And you just ran away? They all just started shooting, all right? I think they're all dead. Pretty soon, more people will die. - A lot more. - Go, go! Huh? (GUNS COCKING) What's with that old man shotgun? Can't you count? You only have two barrels so put that down. We don't want anyone to get hurt, right? Very good comprehension. For a camel rider. I bet you're to blame for us being abducted and waking up in this shitty forest. Oh, mean eyes. They've seen a lot. My eyes have also seen a lot. Most of all, they've seen you still have a piece in your belt, so give it up. Go on then, get it yourself. (LAUGHS) - Kill him now. - No wait, okay. All right. Gentlemen, let's just stay cool, okay, very cool. Mm. (SNIFFING) Ooh, ooh, a Polack, eh? Well, they're my favorites. Onion-smelling fat faces with nothing behind them, but you squeal nicely when we hurt you, oh well. Guess you weren't prepared for when the Doc blew that blond's brain out, right? How'd you know about that? I know everything and I see everything. And above all, I saw that he was watching you there. Now the question is why he was watching you. So why were you watching them? I'm looking for a way out. (LAUGHS) A way out, he's looking for a way out! Listen here, you fucker. From now on, I'm your only way out, understood? And don't you forget, this is our party. I know my boys, but I don't know you. And if you screw things up (KNIFE CLATTERS). Understood? You too. Pick up the guns, we're takin' off. Come on, he needs help! (GROANING) (INSECTS CHIRPING) The bleeding stopped. Ah, that burns like hell. Oh, help me get up! Tell me, just what did a nice young man such as yourself do to deserve all of this then. You know, I killed someone. Yes kid, so did I. YOUNG MAN: Did you find anything? Indeed, there's trees as far as the eye can see. They messed us up, they've really fucked us up. We should have just killed them, that fucking doctor. You know what, we go out there now, chase after him. And we finish him! Are you nuts, he needs a hospital! Hospital. Pain doesn't suit you, Claude, not at all. So, ready for action, huh? Fuck it. I didn't plan on dying in bed of old age anyway. So why the hell not? My guys will have the Western section surrounded by tomorrow, and we're shooting everything that moves. Client or goods, don't care. Happy hunting, Doc. And the same to you. Thought he was one of us. He answers to Witos, the fucker who runs the shop there. Where are Aaron and Genie? (STAMMERS) Shall I look for them? Look for what? Have you lost something, Ronny? Your cunt perhaps? No. You know why we're supposed to use this shit here? - You know why? - Yeah. No, you you know nothing, Ronny? I'll tell you something, the greatest warriors were destroyed because they were in love. Love only gets you killed out there. This is a war not a whorehouse. So then, Ronny, what do you want? I want blood! Good, then go out and secure the Western section. Ronny, there was a guy named Leon Kamarowski. What was his story? - He claims he's a dealer. - A dealer? I'll tell you, that was a fucking cop and you let him escape. Now, Ronny, if I didn't respect your father so much I'd have cut your pretty face a long time ago. So please, fuck off all right? Benjamin Schröder, Uganda, Lebanon, Iraq. (CHUCKLES) He's even graced Russia with his work. Good man, no? The moist poisonous scorpion in the Valley of Pain. Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to his pupil. Kamarowski and Hassan have been captured by Knochenhauer. But there is a little problem. Petrosevitsch has allied with two hunters. Huh? With who? Nikolai Kamenko and Samuel Croft. Well, we must watch them. Is my brother Johan back? Yes, he just arrived. What's this, Witos? Those two betrayed us and allied with the enemy. How can you stay so calm? They should be drawn and quartered. I forbid you from talking that smart tone to me! Send Artensius to Johan. He has something for me. Of course. You're not in a position to forbid. (CHUCKLES) It's my money, it's my rules. I'm going out to continue my studies. (SNIFFING) Mmm. Witos plans to rid himself of an unpleasant companion. Give him this. Potassium cyanide. (BIRDS CHIRPING) It's really cool actually. We have no cops, no justice, no prosecutors. You can do whatever you want, kill as many virgins as you want and nobody gives a shit. So whoever's responsible for this shit knows how the world works today. Mm, yeah, a virgin. That'd be nice now. I think the Polack's a virgin, and believe me, on my team, no one remains a virgin for too long. (LAUGHING) So you here and the Polack to the back end of the line. The others, secure the middle. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. He's still smoking. Yeah, I'll smoke you if you're not careful. I'll alert the enemies to our position. You should just shut your stupid fucking mouth and join the line. Come on. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MAN GROANS) (TAPPING) (CARTRIDGE CLICKING) (CHUCKLES) YOUNG WOMAN: Why do we have to wear these stupid things anyways? It's the middle of summer. You know what Schröder said. You mustn't develop feelings for your partner here. If you show feelings, then you hesitate. Well, well, so you know what's going on here? Spit it out already? (GUN BLASTING) And now what? Do you wanna play the hero too, you little rat? Put your gun down. That's a good girl. What's that stupid look? Were you fucking that bitch? No. I would have. (CHUCKLES) Now you can tell me who you are, you fucker! And what you want from me. People pay to hunt down criminals. It's like a game for the elites. Who abducted me? I don't know, others do that. I'm here with a guy named Ben Schröder. He can help you get you out of here but for that you'll need me alive. What if I win, what's the first prize? No idea, but it's supposed to be big. Now listen to me, kid, if you're fucking with me I'll blow your brains out. Come on, move! NIKOLAI: Hey, what's your name then? SAJOSCHA: Sajoscha. What kind of name is that? Russian. Ah, a communist then. We hid a few supplies here. And what about weapons? No, only the stuff we had with us. Give me your camo jacket. But why? I like it, give it to me. So then. Which way are we heading? That way. But we'll be walking in circles. Just trust me. Are you sure? - Yeah. - So you take the lead. Here. (PRAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) So you're here to guard me, right? I think it's really nice that you're boss lets me pray. But only one guard and you've got the safety on. So if someone shows up and attacks us. (CHUCKLES) We're as good as dead. You have to be able to react within one second. Ya got it? Hey, calm down. We're both on the same side. I've been abducted too. If I'm not allowed to have a gun then the guy with one should at least know how to handle it, okay? I'm only trying to help. Down there there's a small lever. You release that and cock the lever, then you rip it! (MAN GROANS) (BODY CRASHES) Ah man, I'm fucking sick of it. It feels like we've been walking in circles for hours. (SIGHS) Hey there, boy. Hey boy, I'm talking to you! Do you know what I can't stand? Guys who never answer and keep their mouths shut. Just like my brother, he always keeps his mouth shut when asked something. Maybe we should teach him a lesson. The younger generation doesn't have any respect these days. Hmm, maybe you're right. (GROANS) I think some people here are really lacking some respect. So what do you say, huh? You know what, I'll stick my dick up your ass and blast you to the moon! I have a great little idea for us! We're gonna play a little game! Open up, open your mouth! (HAND SLAPPING) The well-known blowjob game. Open up! Mm! (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) Come here, you fucker, pigs! I'll fuck you in the ass, you fucker! (GUNS BLASTING) Shit! Hey fucker, wait for me, man! (MAN GROANS) (GUNS BLASTING) (PANTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) Leon, how are you? You all right, man? Nothing's all right, man. Hey, they're both dead. Calm down, they're just dead bodies now. I don't give a fuck about that! Don't touch me! Nine dead within the last 30 minutes. WITOS: Clear the bodies from the field. We enter the final phase soon. Pretty girl, could be my daughter. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You wanted to talk to us? Yes, you all know the meaning and purpose of the Breakdown Forest. The goal is to research the evil deeply-rooted in the genetics of the human organism in order to create a perfect soldier devoid of all emotion and morality. And it is our task to fulfill the legacy of our ancestors by carrying out the necessary research to successfully develop a superior breed of Ubermensch. All participants, no matter whether hunters or hunted, love killing. The most effective subjects so far are Petrosevitsch. Jendriczek. Kamarowski. Knochenhauer. And Wishnewsky. They all are components of the new stage of evolution and the superior gene in our family is the key to it all. We Ribbecks have a very special and rare extra chromosome so I've decided to sacrifice our youngest and weakest brother Sivarius against his will sadly for the advancement of our research. Sacrifice is necessary but about an hour ago Sivarius escaped his destiny due to the incompetence of our staff. If Sivarius joins with Sajoscha or one of the candidates this would mean our certain downfall. Mrs. Schweizer, I can see your hands are twitching. You may now. (GUN BLASTING) You stay in the room, all others leave us. How's my niece? Well, she's suffered badly from all of the experiments and she's lost all of her hair. But Samira's a very strong girl. Did you fulfill her wish? Yes, and I made it myself. Samira is a symbol of beauty. I'm against sending her into battle. But she takes after her father. Her lust for blood grows with each passing day. So I decided to consecrate her and entrust her with the task of bringing Sivarius back, and, if necessary, liquidating him. Following this mission, she will assist Johan in his case studies. There are many evil spirits in the Valley of Pain. Be vigilant and go to Chotl in the chamber. Samira will be consecrated now. Ah, speak of the devil! SAMIRA: You still have blood on your jacket. - Must be nice to kill. - Oh, what a messy job I've made of it! Leave us alone for a moment. You should be in a better mood, my dear. There's reason to celebrate! Yeah, sure. Don't you want to sit, I'm getting a stiff neck. My father doesn't take me seriously at all. Do you know how terrible it is for me to be stuck in this backwater all the time? Indeed, my child. I know precisely how this must feel. Goddammit, Werner, I'm just dying over here! I mean, you can go out whenever you want and you can do whatever you want. And me, I'm slowly wasting away. Can't you understand? I understand it well. You know, we're descended from gods but Witos spoke the words that will now set you free. Your tears broke our hearts so now you will do what a real Ribbeck must. Drink, my child. (THRILLING MUSIC) From now on, you carry a great responsibility within you. Be mindful of it. Voila! Yes, go ahead. I picked out your weaponry personally, my child. The knife was hardened in the blood of our founding fathers. It's story is much older than you might expect. With it, the bodies of many victims have been cut open! Now you must wield it too to slice open the deformed bodies of the subhumans! (THUNDER CRACKING) Oh shit. We walked in a circle. Are you fucking kidding me, kid? Hey, let's go back to the hut. - What hut is that? - We can stay there tonight. Come on, follow me. Yeah, shit. (BIRD CAWING) They took the bodies away. I was attacked here. Okay, let's go in. Sammy. Sammy, close it. Ah, it's creepy in here. What do we have here? There was someone else in here. Sit down. (MEN GRUNTING) Sit down there. So then what is this place? Breakdown Forest, imagine it as a big hunt. The customers come, pay, and are allowed to hunt. And who set up this shit? It all comes from the Ribbeck family. Ribbeck, Ribbeck. How many hunted are there? Maybe 50. Really 50, so many? They organized it all perfectly. How did they do it? Yes, of course, they only go for people no one will miss. No relatives, no reports, people who live under the radar. Scumbags. Okay, we need a sentry, I'll do it. You two sleep and tomorrow you'll show me the way outta here. Can we get our weapons back? No, I'll keep 'em. (SIGHS) Good night, Nikolai. NIKOLAI: Yeah, yeah. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (FEET PATTERING) (GUN BLASTING) (GASPS) Keep calm, okay? I won't hurt you. (MAN GROANS) (GUN BLASTS) Hey, who's ruining our morning today? - Let go, dammit! - Come on! Claude! What Claude? Who's Claude, hm? How did I get here? Let me go! Hey, Ali. Away from him. What, just tell me what you did and how I got here. And I'm not Ali, I'm Haci. Oh, gesundheit. Why am I here? What are you doing to me? Nothing yet, but that can soon change. Over there. Noah, come. So, you people brought me here, tell me why? You, you, you there, all men without heart, without faith or honor. You take power from the devil and bring me here. Or maybe it was God who brought you here, huh? My God wouldn't do that, my God's proud of me. Yeah, and how many people have you killed in his name? Huh? Don't religions all stand for love and world peace? All religions, huh? And what did guys like you turn it into instead? Do you really think there are virgins waiting for you up there? (LAUGHS) Virgins. We have no virgins here, we only have a pack of hellhounds who want to find and kill whoever brought us here, and God is waiting for us to kick them in the ass and send them back to hell. So we didn't kidnap you and bring you here, but you could help us exact revenge on whoever did. - I help you? - Yeah. Hmm, what do you know about fighting? Ah, you'll soon find out, my friend. My name's Claude. Partners? Partners in revenge. (STICK WHACKING) You stupid fucker, towelhead, Arab pig! I don't believe it! You stupid asshole, you should've killed that fucker on the spot instead of all this "he can be useful to us" crap! What use was he then? Our boys are dead and he ran away. (HAND SLAPPING) Talk to me like that again and I'll fucking eat you alive and vomit you out back into your whore of a mother's shitty cunt. Just shut your mouth and I'll finish the job myself. (CHUCKLES) You really think you'll make it on your own, huh? You're just a victim here, don't you realize? Just like me. Watch out, asshole. I'm no victim, I've never been a victim. I only make victims. And if you cross my path one more fucking time you'll understand what I mean. (BRANCH SNAPPING) You okay? I don't wanna be here anymore. You don't have to, I mean, look at all this shit. That's a damn abyss. We can get out of here and start again, okay? Hey, hey. Where's Sammy? Sammy? Samuel? (THRILLING MUSIC) Sammy. Sammy? - Sammy. - Look here. Shit. Ah, Sammy. Samuel! Hey, shut up, you'll disclose our position! Hold that. How could they sneak up like that, fucking how? (MAN SHOUTS) Put the gun down. I said put the gun down! - Calm down, calm down. - Now, now! And the handgun too, man. Okay. Okay, I'll put it down. Okay, there, there, there. Now can we talk? I'll tell you what we'll do. I'm going away with this boy now, no one follows. You'll let me go. And if anyone comes after me then I'll blow a ventilation hole right through the skull of his curly little head here, you understand? And that's how we're gonna do it. I won't let that happen. Ah, you from child services now? Something like that? Or something. Uh, so you're a smartass. Down on your knees, move! Stay calm, Niko. - Just stay calm. - Now! - Okay, you fucker, calm down. - Get down. Okay. Niko! (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) Fuck, I'll kill you, asshole! I'll fucking kill you, you'll see! Where's the other boy? Which boy? His name is Samuel, where is he? I don't know any Samuel. I can help you, I'm a good marksman! So am I. You don't know Samuel? No! Unfortunate for you then. Dammit, come on. (RIFLE BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) (SCREAMS) Niko! Niko, hey, hey, you okay, hey! Hey, come with me. We gotta find Samuel. There's the trail, take this. Here. That's not how I imagined it. Where is Witos? No idea, what's up? Schröder's sweeping the Western section. Johan and Samira are there now. So what, a bit of fireworks are good for the masses. Now leave me in peace. (GUNS BLASTING DISTANTLY) This game's slowly growing on me. Be careful now, it begins. Hey, look there. (BOMB WHOOSHES) (BOMB BLASTING) I think that it's time for a tactical retreat. (BOMB BLASTING) Finding my father is the top priority. We're going in. (THRILLING MUSIC) (GASPS) Watch out! (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) This is crazy. We have to get back as fast as possible. Her father takes priority. Do what you want but I'm out. (MAN GROANS) (RIFLE BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) So, does it hurt? You're going to tell me how to get out of here now. You're all as good as dead. (FLESH CRUNCHES) (MAN GROANS) - Forget about him. - Sivarius? We must eliminate him before he rats on us. Damn, leave him, he's finished. Who brought us here? (RIFLES BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) Take cover! (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) - (RIFLE COCKING) - Put your hands up, come on. - Drop the gun. - They're about 30 men. (BOMB BLASTS) Take cover! Yeah. (RIFLE BLASTING) (THRILLING MUSIC) (GUNS BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (EXPLOSION BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) I'll finish you off, you assholes! - I need a bigger gun, dammit! - Don't shout, just believe. Believe, and a gun will fall from the sky? (EXPLOSION BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) Believe and you will receive, you see? - Who? - Seek cover, go on. (GUNS BLASTING) Cover! What the fuck is this? I thought they were your guys? Shit, we've gotta get outta here! No way, here! You help me now! And if you screw me, you're dead. And fire! (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (EXPLOSION BLASTING) Hey, he's with me, he's with me, don't worry. - Good? - How many have you seen? Maybe 30, 40, we have to get outta here. Now move it! (GUNS BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) Fuck, I ran out of ammo. Throw it away, and come! (GUNS BLASTING) (MEN GROANING) (MAN SCREAMS) (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) Control your rate of fire, okay? On three. One, two, three! (GUNS BLASTING) Take the left flank! (MAN SHOUTS) (GUNS BLASTING) (RIFLE CLICKS) Hey, there's just too many. We have to get away. (GUNS BLASTING) SAJOSCHA: Piece of shit. Give me cover. With what though? We're out of ammo, we need cover! - Hey, I'll take care of it. - I wanna help you, man! Get back, dammit, are you trying to get blown away? - God, come on! - I wanna help you, man! - No! - Get lost! I'll take care of it. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GUNS BLASTING) They got me. Daddy? Oh. Samira, tell me what are you doing here? I can take care of myself. Witos wants me to assist you. Does he now? Does he think I'm incompetent? (SIGHS) No, of course not. But we must ensure nothing happens to you as to not to endanger the plan. All right then, so be it. Come on, we must find the old man! (MEN GRUNTING) (GUNS BLASTING) Damn, we're surrounded! (EXPLOSION BLASTING) Shit, we need to get out of this fog. - Noah, you cover our six. - Got it. Keep in mind our boys are still out there so be careful. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (EXPLOSION BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) (GUNSHOTS POPPING) (EXPLOSION BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Get up, they've chosen you. (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) Come, Sya, get up! (GROANING) Wait, it's my ears, my ears are ringin', man. Did you see that boy? What boy? When you showed up, there was a boy. I didn't see any boy. We have to get back, we have to find Sammy. How do you expect to find someone here? He's alive, don't you get it, he's still alive! He's alive! (GROANS) We'll kill them all, okay? Then we'll return and look for the trail, okay? Okay, okay. (GUN BLASTING) (GROANING) Holy shit, fuck, no fuck, no God, nah, ah! (SHOUTS) (ELATED HUMMING) Oh, naughty Werner, naughty Werner! Sajoscha, I wish to make amends for my most boorish behavior! It may now arise, please allow my eyes to delight in your despondent face, the fruit of all my labor! Help him. Slowly. Bravo! Who's a good boy? Oh shit. Oh my boy, don't you worry. It is but a wound to the tortured flesh of one who languishes in a pointless existence. Enough of this combative tone. Greetings, Werner von Braun! Give me your hand so that we may make one another's acquaintance in a spirit of friendship. Fuck you. Yes, quite literally I'm afraid, boy! (BLADE CLATTERS) Oh my boy, you won't find a harder fucker than Auntie Werner. Back off, or I may find myself forced to penetrate your sweet face in a manner most displeasing to your delicate disposition. What do you want, man? Just a little taste of your strength. - Huh? - Not physical strength, dear. I mean your will, which I shall gladly break. Oh, goodbye boy! Sajoscha! (GUN BLASTING) (GROANING) - Sajoscha! - Shut up! Ah, Schröder's men. Take him with you, I do not need him here anymore. A Ribbeck doesn't stand in the way of a customer's desires. (CHUCKLES) No, let me go, no! - Hey, stop hey! - Sajoscha! - Turn around, come back, hey! - Help me! I'll kill you, man! - Niko, come back! - No! SAJOSCHA: Niko! NIKOLAI: No! (GROANS) Stay on the ground, you worm! You're a disgrace. You have defiled the forest floor, the great Petrosevitsch! (CHUCKLES) Auntie Werner loves such fairy tales. (GROANS) What are you doing with Sammy and Niko? Da da da da! We're breaking them! (PLAYFUL CARNIVAL MUSIC) We're transporting their spirit into the great void! To a world beyond good and evil! Their bodies will henceforth be but empty shells! Do you want to save them? Let 'em go! To do that, you'll have to get passed me. (GROANS) (SAJOSCHA GRUNTS) (WERNER GROANS) I'll fuck you, do you understand me, you fucking bastard? Just die, you fucker! (PANTING) (LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) A dealer! (GROANS) A dealer. You're a fucking cop! I've been waiting for that, and this here, I won't need it. (MAN GRUNTS) (MAN GROANS) (COUGHING) (MAN GRUNTS) (HEAD SMASHES) Any last wishes then? Do you still remember what Claude said to you? What did he say? You watch way too many action movies. (CRUNCHING) (MAN GROANS) (ELBOW SMASHES) (MAN GROANS) (FIST SMASHING) (MAN GROANS) (COUGHING) (MAN GRUNTS) (MAN GROANS) (MAN SCREAMS) (CRUNCHING) (KNIFE CLATTERS) (GAGGING) (BLOOD SPURTING) RHODER: Hey! Cool show! You missed your calling as a surgeon! Rhoder! RHODER: And you are Leon Kamarowski, a wannabe cop. So you brought me here. I didn't do shit. Why can't you just die like a good boy? But today is payday. As you can see, I've already paid my bill. Still, not a fair deal, kid. Here. Take the gun, it belonged to one of their leaders. They captured a couple of people over there. Go and free them, but keep one thing in mind, Leon. Don't think everything's over if you just run away. Breakdown Forest is your enemy, not me. Your badge and your ego must die with this meeting here. And so, once you've found and gathered enough people willing to fight the others then, only then, you can call me. You'll find me up by the Amselberg, but be very careful. It's a real minefield. Why don't you just come with me then? There are others scattered, running around, and hunted here. If you're such a great fighter, man, then prove it now and just help me. I already have. Scattered, you're not useful for me, but if you can bring me a small army then rock and roll! Nice to kill ya, baby! (CARTRIDGE CLICKING) (THRILLING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC, "AVE MARIA") (GUN BLASTING DISTANTLY) Sajoscha, get back, get down! Snipers! SAJOSCHA: Over here! Sya, it's me! Hey. It's me, hey. Let's get outta here. Wait, I need a gun, man. (GROANING) Listen, no matter what happens now, we have to stay together no matter what. You know how to use that thing? I'm learning on the job. That was a great shot there. (MAN GROANING) Oh shit! (WHIMPERING) (SPARKS CRACKLING) (SPARKS CRACKLING) (GROANING) SAJOSCHA: Where am I, doctor? What's this supposed to be, a revolution? (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) LEON: Get up. Come on, I said stand up! Leave this son of a bitch to me. Wait, wait, wait a minute, put that down. I wanna know what's going on here, man. You better kill me right away, Sajoscha. If not, then I'll make sure hell vomits all its bile upon you. You all do not know who you're dealing with here. I am here to pick the ripened fruit from the Valley of Pain. Mentally-disturbed individuals whose animal instincts keep them alive pay for all that you see here. They have it in abundance, bills with dead people on them. Paper that will plunge humanity into the abyss. Yeah, filthy lucre! You remember your life before this place and what you did yourself for money. Overcome your amnesia and look the devil in the eye. We're here in the Valley of Pain, know your history and all your dirty secrets. Assassination was your profession. Corrupt politicians, drug lords, and anyone with enough money were your clients. But four years ago, you made a crucial mistake that brought us into the picture. A door opened before you and your journey into the abyss began. Professor Richard Giessen's legendary prestige proceeded him but your target wasn't him. Rather Kenshin Yamamoto. You couldn't have known that, as Yakuza boss, he also held one of our most important outposts in the world. These two great men's handshakes would have seen Breakdown Forest rise to new heights but when you carried out your contract this was prevented. (RIFLE BLASTING) Hey. Hey, are you okay? Oh, Samuel. What do you think your dear uncle would say if he saw how you have chosen to side with the enemy? And of you, Leon, you're a particular disappointment. Big dreams but so full of fear. Oh yeah? Of course, if that wasn't the case you would have pulled the trigger and killed Eyck Rhoder. I won't make that mistake a second time. (GUN BLASTING) (GROANING) SAMUEL: Geez, how is he still standing? I could keep going all day, fucker! Only Sajoscha matters, only he! You should just turn your weapons on yourselves, do it, otherwise you'll perish miserably in the bosom of Mother Nature. Sajoscha, you're the one we're interested in. (GROANING) (CLICKING) Now listen then, since you studied me so closely what am I about to do? I think you're going to shoot me. But please, not in the face. I want to spare my daughter that sight. Really, you're daughter? Oh trust me, you can die knowing she'll soon follow you. Everyone of you, I'll destroy your whole organization and send you all to hell. I will kill you all. What do you have to say to that then, huh? As I said, just please not in the face. (LAUGHING) Well, come on then. I don't have all day you know. (LAUGHING) (DRAMATIC BELL RINGING) Hmm. (GUNS BLASTING DISTANTLY) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) That was rough, I hope he comes back quickly. (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) (GASPS) Drop the gun! Put your hands up. Tell me, what have you done to my father? Where is he, now? He's dead. What? Shoot her now. We'll take her with us. (GUN BLASTS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GROANING) Help me, man! How's it look? You lost a lotta blood, man. They must have hit an artery or something. I'll just tie it tighter, all right? (GROANING) Where did you learn that? LEON: A first aid course at the police academy. You're a cop? Not today. What's that I hear, is it a state whore? Damn, I should have known it. Usually I smell these guys from 1000 yards away, even against the wind. I think I'm getting old. You're old, Claude. Thanks, smartass. Claude, I thought you were all dead. Yeah, I thought we were dead too. So much for that dealer story then, huh? LEON: Are you all right? CLAUDE: Sure, with this explosive weather. SAJOSCHA: You get used to it. That's Claude, he found me. These guys are okay. We were trying to find a way out but then this damn Dr. Froelich got in the way of our escape. - Don't worry now, he's dead. - Oh. Yeah, we killed him. He had brought us here. Oh, it might sound a bit irreverent but I'm delighted. So we've cut off one of the beast's heads. The best thing to do now is to get out of this fog, regroup, and launch a counterattack. Sounds like a plan. Hey, you asshole, stay still! Aaron! Oh! Who are you freaks? I hope you're all well-behaved because I don't have enough ammo for you all. Down, drop your guns! Considering the situation, I would suggest you start with this polite gesture. Hmm. Okay, guys. I know a way out. How is it that you know a way out of here? One of those damned fuck knuckles joined me. At first I had to torture him a bit but then when the shit hit the fan he killed his own people and saved my ass. Yes. And now he's escaped so why are you chasing him? Well, we ran out of ammunition. Cuckoo! (GASPING) If you need ammunition, come and get it. I have enough for all of you. The man wants to share. No, I really don't think so. KNOCHENHAUER: And our little Polack in the middle of it all. If you have a bone to pick, pick it with me! (KNOCHENHAUER LAUGHS) KNOCHENHAUER: Yes, we will do that, my friend. We will. But it would be better for you if you turned around and killed the others. Then I may even let you live. You wanna just chit chat or will you come out and play! We have to retreat! I'll provide you cover. That's not a good idea. I'm staying here too. You can piss off! KNOCHENHAUER: The beginning of a beautiful friendship. Come on, let's go. Fuck off, dammit! Let's give them a headstart. Too bad that you are on the wrong side because actually we fit very well together. We were in the same boat, remember? You know what, you're fucking boat just sank! (GUNS BLASTING) (GRUNTING) (GUNS BLASTING) Just die, you damn devils! (EXPLOSION BLASTING) (GUNS BLASTING) (THRILLING MUSIC) Goddamn bastards! (GUNS BLASTING) Stay behind cover! (GUNS BLASTING) (RIFLE BLASTING) (PANTING) (CLICKING) (GUNS BLASTING) (BLOOD SPURTING) (GRUNTS) (GUN BLASTING) (GROANING) (LAUGHS) (SOLEMN VOCAL MUSIC) (GUN BLASTING) (GROANS) (SQUISHING) (GROANING) KNOCHENHAUER: Cuckoo, I found you! Come on, get on your knees so I can ram my cock in your other eye! Ngh-ngh, I have a much better idea. (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) So, did it hurt? (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) You damn fucker! You see, I'll fuck you! I'll fuck you! (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) Do you think all these puny shots can stop me? (GUN BLASTS) (MAN GROANS) Let's see how much blood there is inside you. Hold on! (GUNS BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) (GUNS BLASTING) MUFFLED VOICE: Sajoscha, Sajoscha! (GUNS BLASTING) (GROANING) (MAN SHOUTS) Cool plan, shame it all went wrong. I need a gun! Here. (GUNS BLASTING) (GROUND BLASTING) (MAN GROANS) (GUNS BLASTING) (RIFLE CLICKING) Okay, move! (GROANING) (BIRD TRILLING) Yeah, I know. You belong to them. Make our father proud, Sajoscha. Hey, hey wait. Wa-watch out, someone's coming! Yeah! (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) (COUGHING) (MAN WHISTLING GIDDILY) Well, little man, have you shit your pants? What are you doing with that butter knife? You don't wanna hurt uncle here, do you? Let him go. (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) (BODY CRASHING) Hmm. (GRUNTS) SAMUEL: Sajoscha! Sammy. Sajoscha! Sajoscha, Sajoscha, Sajoscha. Oh, what a delicate trophy you are. And your fear, my boyish beauty, you tremble like the last leaf on a dying tree. And soon shall you sing as my cock thrusts in your tender skin. Let your music please my ear, good luck my dear. And now listen carefully, my friend. I'll tell you something. Whoever survives me will survive till doomsday. Get down on your knees, and sing me your hymn. Scream for me. (WHIMPERING) (WHISTLING) First you and then it's the Polack's turn. (LAUGHS) The Polack is here! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, be very careful now. Otherwise jamboree starts right away. Hey, you have totally changed. You look like a real man with that huge gun. Throw the grenade away! Who do we have here? Are you meant to be fucking Santa Claus? For naughty boys like you, I am the hangman. Ho ho ho! Wait a second, idiot, this is my party, and you're not invited! It's my fuckin' party and you're just the cattle here! Do you seriously think any of you can take me out? You're cowards, not men! Faggots, each more faggoty than the next! Pay attention, you fuckin' Polack, I'll show you something great, the greatest show on Earth. The world is not enough and no one gets away! (GUN BLASTING) (MAN GROANING) Down! (EXPLOSION BLASTING) Hmm. There was a confrontation between Samira and Petrosevitsch. He and Kamarowski have teamed with a couple of other hunted. There is as yet no trace of Johan and August. I want to know the position of all the remaining subjects. No, you will not, Witos. Now stop crying, Mrs. Schweizer, otherwise I'll have you shot. Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, you're sorry. You know what we were doing here and you participated. Now wipe away your tears and just get out. Oh! (SIGHS) Samira. If you only knew just why you died. (CHUCKLES) What could have been better for us, Witos, than this martyr's death? Trudel, another glass of wine. It's Traudel. I'll get another bottle. Pardon, Trud, Traud. WITOS: Without Johan, it's difficult - to start the second stage. - Why difficult? It's really simple. Never forget, Witos, that sometimes a bullet is more efficient than an atom bomb. For example, these three bullets brought America to its knees in November, 1963, when we had Kennedy shot. You're right there. Sometimes with even just a finger snap you can subdue the world, thank you. WITOS: May I ask you for the honor of a toast? With pleasure. Then we drink to me, I mean, to us, and to our world history. WITOS: Do you know what you're dying for? Pardon, I'm a god, I don't die. I leave that to others. Yet the sting is now in your back. (GROANS) But I will not perish. Your benefits brought me to the other side. That was cyanide. (GASPING) Good luck in the future, your future ends today as you fall into the abyss of eternity. (PROLONGED GASPING) (SINISTER LAUGHING) (CRYING) In my shitty life, I've done everything wrong that a man can do wrong. And if I look around here, the same goes for all of you. These two guys and many others have given their lives here, for us and our freedom, and that must not be in vain. These guys behind the Breakdown Forest project know all about us. We will never be able to escape, we will never be free. And we will always have to sleep with one eye open. Do you want that? No. That's why we're going to turn the tables on them. We will hunt them. We will hunt them down like mangy dogs until they land in hell. Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. What do we have out there? Nothing but lies. A world full of shitty people doing their shitty jobs every fucking day. Everyday the same shit. It's just that sick. But not me. I really don't care what you did, that doesn't concern me. We know their name. Ribbeck. They kidnapped us and they started this war so they'll get one. So I say we stay and kill all of them. We believed what we did was the only right thing to do. In the world out there, none of us knew who he was but now we have an idea. Rhoder said he'd need an army and he shall get one. Several strangers who become friends against an overwhelming enemy. We won the first battle, now we'll win this war, for good. (THRILLING MUSIC) (THRILLING MUSIC)
