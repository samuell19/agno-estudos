- How was your day? - It was a bit cold. - How did Frankie do? - Oh, Frankie was tremendous. He's a good boy. Are you hungry? Are you sure? Good. I won't give you too much. There you are. Bless us, O Lord, for these thy gifts... which of thy bounty we are about to receive... No. No. Oh, no. Oh, God. Last night, a masked gunman broke into a house in a remote coastal area... and shot to death, in front of his family... a man believed to be a Republican sympathiser. This is the latest in the new outbreak of killings... following the breakdown of peace talks... between Unionists and nationalists. Here's your target. Frankie McGuire. He's been responsible for the deaths of 11 regular army lads... seven RUC officers and uncounted numbers of loyalist paras. This bastard has never seen the inside of a cell. I'd like to change that. This is it, lads. Mind how you go. Stand by. - Oh, Jesus. - Come on. In here. Move it. Move it. - Seanie? - I'm all right. Jesus Christ, half the fucking army's out there. Keep your heads down. Seanie. I'm fucked, Frankie. - Frankie, let's get out of here. - Go on. - We have to go now, Frankie. - Go. Desmond. Where's Frankie McGuire? Up your fucking arse. Yesterday, in what the army said was a routine security operation... soldiers, in a house-to-house pursuit of an IRA gunman... found themselves in a fire fight that resulted in unexpected casualties. While the IRA denounced the attack as an unlawful and murderous operation... the army put full responsibility on the IRA... and said it had no choice but to respond to the latest outbursts. Both sides said that this made the search for peace more urgent. Authorities say the casualties sustained cast further doubts... on the future on any peace initiatives. Frankie? It's Martin. - For fuck's sake, Frankie. - You had me shaking there. How you doing? Grand. - You hungry, son? - Cheers. A present from the lads. They send their best. Good to see you. - You're looking well. - Fuck you, you cunt. There was a big turnout for Dessie's funeral. Which was good. The cabinet was talking peace. The whole time, the SAS were waiting to wipe us out. It was a set-up, all right. - One of our own? - We still don't know who. I was gonna get you a paper, but there's no point. Northern Ireland Office spouting the same old shite. They say the word "peace," but end of the day... all they want is surrender. Fucking things. If we could take them out, they'd have to listen. I've been working on that. Stinger missiles. Maybe then they'll talk peace. But it's gonna need you, Frankie. - So you're a judge, are you? - State court. I don't know too many judges, socially speaking. You wanna know what's the single biggest problem trying to raise money? People don't understand what's going on over there. Well, we have a saying, Mr Fitzsimmons: If you're not confused, you don't know what's going on. That's it, isn't it? It's fantastic. Home sweet home. Aye. When we need the money, we'll need the money quickly. Here's a construction site address... in case anybody wants to know where you work. I told them you're a friend of the family starting out. - They're connected, are they? - No. Not in the least. I've known Tom O'Meara 20 years. He served under my father. - In the army? - No. The police force. - A cop? - Safest place in the city. Daddy, Daddy. Thank you. - Mr O'Meara? - Tom. Hi. - Come on in. That's Annie. - Hi, Annie. - How was your trip? - It was good. - A long one, isn't it? - Aye. Come here. This is Morgie. Morgan. Morgan. Hey. Say hi to Rory. Sheila's in here. Come say hello. - Sheila, Rory's here. - Oh, hi, welcome. I'm the mother. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks. - Where's Bridget? - What do you think? On the phone. Careful. The kids were supposed to get this crap out of the hallway. Well, it's not much, but it's dry and it's warm. Come on, get off the phone. Bed's over here. There's a bit of a bath and shower here. You got to jiggle this thing. Sometimes it runs on. How are you fixed for work? Did Fitz find something? Aye, I start in a couple of days. The TV's here. What are you doing? A building site. - Construction, huh? - Aye. Good, good. Well, if there's anything you need... No, it's great. It's very decent of you to put me up like this. - No, don't thank us, thank Fitz. - Guys, dinner. We'll be right there, honey. Besides, it's good to have somebody around here that pees standing up. For food and clothes and all that grows... for family too, dear God, thank... Dear God, thank you. I hope Rory likes the basement, because I don't. - Rory likes the basement a lot. - Pass the vegetables. May I serve you? Say when. The meat looks delicious. What is it? It's corned beef and cabbage. I thought that's all you ate over there. No. I've never had it. You got this over there, don't you? Aye, we do have that. In fact, I was baptised in it. - You were baptised in beer? - It's a joke, honey. Have some vegetables. Mum put a lot of effort into this meal. - Why do you always pick on me? - Wanna pass it down, please? - Pass the mustard. - I don't like it. What part of Ireland are you from? From Cookstown. - Where's that? That near Belfast? - It's in the middle of the north. It's on the shore of Lough Neagh. Do you have a girlfriend in Ireland? Come on, guys. - Morgan, come on. - No. That's kind of a personal question. Yeah. Leave the guy alone. Give him a break. He just got here. - Bridget has a boyfriend. - Will you guys knock it off? - Well, Rory, welcome to America. - Thanks. Sector David, 2746. 13:30 meal. Diaz, you're with me again today, 14:30. Everybody else, same post and meal as yesterday. This is getting ridiculous. Everybody's laughing at me. - Why? - I'm supposed to drive the car. You're supposed to sit back and ride next to me like a gentleman. Your stripes entitle you to that. Absolutely. The guy who rides with the sergeant is the chauffeur. - Yeah. - And that's me. So when are you gonna let me do my job? - When am I gonna drive? - I don't know. Tomorrow. You've been saying that for three years. Excuse me, goldilocks, do you have the right time? - Give it up. - You're too tall. That's my sister, you bastard. - Frankie. - It's Rory now, you cunt. Rory, Frankie, whatever. What's that? It's a high-five. You're in the US of A. - Look at the state of you. - It's called style. - Calvin Klein. - Circus clown, more like. Look at that one. Sorry. It wasn't my fault. He did it. I didn't. Look at the two of us. A couple of Fenian bastards, isn't it? Jesus Christ, mind the car, will you? She's just been waxed. - That's yours? - Aye. She's a beaut, isn't she? - Bullocks. - Honest to God. Bought and nearly paid for. Fuck, I left the door open. Frankie, are we gonna go through with this? Three-five, 47 Central. I've got a foot pursuit. Northbound, towards 207. Male, black. Hey, sarge. The car's blocked. Central, 35 Sergeant, 205 and Post. Heading westbound towards the park. Three-five Sergeant north on 10. Stop. Stop. Two-oh-seven, Central. Towards the park. Northbound. Hey. Move. Damn it. Wait, wait, wait. Three-five Sergeant. They're north through the park. That's a copy, 35 Sergeant. Hey, hey, hey. You're gonna be sorry. - Don't lose him. - I'm on him. Jesus Christ. God damn it. Come here. Let me see your hands. - He's my collar. - Take it easy. I got it. Do you know not to run away from police? Yes. You'll get yourself shot that way. What have you got here? He robbed this at the 10th Avenue bodega. I witnessed him put it in his pocket. - You witnessed it? - Yeah. How old are you, son? - Twenty-two. - Fifteen, sir. Stand him up. That's old enough to know not to run away from the police. - Yes, sir. - What's your story? I was too embarrassed to bring the condoms to the cash register. Turn him around. Stand still. Turn around. Give me your hand. I swear to God, I'll never do this again. Take a hike. Sarge, why don't you cuff the rookie? Here it is. The Irish Republican Navy. Aye. What do you think? The pitch is off. It'll give us a half knot. - For fuck's sake. - What is it? It's pissing antifreeze. - I knew it. - Pull it. We've got the prop work, the pitch and all that... the caulking and the pipes... the transducer, the bilge pump, and timing the engine out. A dozen 55-gallon drums of fuel. Why don't we just FedEx the damn gear home and be done with it? The two of us crossing the Atlantic with a hold full of missiles... so they can shoot our arses off when we get there... - It's crazy. - Aye, it's fucking mad. Three years from now, I'm gonna have my pension... and you know what I'm gonna do? What you gonna do? I'm gonna raise pot-bellied pigs. - Pot-bellied pigs? - Yep. Last night I was watching television. I saw this guy, son of a bitch was making a fortune in New Jersey. - Pigs? - Yeah. So I'm gonna get some... Hi, girls. What about the bakery? Last week it was gonna be a bakery. You know how early you got to get up in the morning to bake bread? We have a 10-52 at 42 West 135th Street. Female called to say husband's getting violent. Police. Police, open up. Police, open the door. - Hi, Mummy call the police? - Yes. Mummy. You whore, come here. - Put that gun down, man. - No. - Let's talk to her. - No. - Come on. - No. No. - I'm going to talk to her. - Let's talk about it. No. Watch it. Take it easy. Fucking guns, man. It's these fucking guns. The john's downstairs. I'm here to collect for Irish Relief. I don't know what you're talking about. Teddy. Irish Relief? - Billy Burke. - Rory Devaney. Martin sent me. - He's a good man, Martin. - Aye. So how do you like America, Rory Devaney? Fine, land of the opportunist, if you ask me. That it is. Fourteen years old, I was sleeping in the back of a saloon. Today I got three of my own, among other things. You've done well for yourself. I've done well with you lads too. Drink? Sit down. - When can we take possession? - Possession? These ain't egg rolls you just ordered. Stingers jacked the Russians out of Afghanistan. It's gonna take some time. - How much time? - Six, eight weeks. Fine. - Can I put you up? - No, I'm sorted out, thanks. - Where you staying? - Across the river. - Across the river? - Aye. Where across the river, Brooklyn? Something like that. - How do I get in touch with you? - Ask for Sean. - This is a Manhattan number. - Aye. About the money. I think you and I... When we have our gear, you'll have your money. It's no problem. Cheers. Hey, Rory... are you Belfast boys born such hard-ons... or is that just something you grow into? Are you asleep, honey? - You faker. - I'm not tired. I'll give you the mummy tuck. Where's ducky? He's a sleepy ducky. It's kind of funny to see, like, my sister getting all worked up about it. She thinks he's kind of cute, and he is cute... but it's not like she'd have a chance. - I mean, he's from Ireland. - Get off the phone. - Wait. My dad's here. - How long have you been talking? We're talking about homework. - Who are you talking to? - A friend. - Three minutes. - Five. Five minutes, please? You have to press D-I-R, return. - What did you just press? - D-I-R, and then enter. D-I-R, and that's "directory," and then enter? - And so, what does C-L-S do? - C-L-S... No, don't do it. Don't... Tom. We're out of milk. Don't close it. I don't wanna close it. C-L-S... - Hi. - I'm gonna go get some milk. You wanna take a little walk? I'll buy you a beer. Come on. It's just a few blocks. It's very peaceful here, isn't it? Yeah. It's quiet. Do you know all the people in these houses? Yeah, most of them. Do you like them? Well, we all get along pretty well. What's it like over there? The violence, I mean. Oh, it's violent. People are fed up. Doesn't seem to be much point to it any more. Oh, yeah. It all depends where you're looking from. Me, I just try to keep my wee arse out of it. These houses, they're fantastic, aren't they? Yeah, they're pretty old. Some of them are from around the turn of the century. Our new ones are older than that. - Hey, Tony. - Hey, O'Meara. How you doing? Good. Hey, Tony, say hello to Rory Devaney. Oh, another frigging mick, huh? I'm an Immigration agent. Stick out your green card now. Come on, come on. He's trying to bust your balls. He runs the pet shop. He's the prince of the poodles. Hey, those are fighting words. You know what this is, don't you, Irish? That's an Italian love muscle. Aye, that's why it's in your hand. A wise guy, huh? Let's find out what you can do with one of these. You and the sergeant, me and Joey. Italians versus Irish. Throw the milk in the cooler, Joey. All right. - Lovely. - Thank you. - You're a wonderful man. - Unbelievable, isn't he? You are a wonderful human being. Oh, no. - I don't know if I can shoot. - You're up, goombah. Hey, Rory, you hear about the Irish guy who tried to blow up a car? He burnt his lips on the tailpipe. Scratch. - That'll be mine. - You're up, Irish. What is this? The luck of the Irish. You pushed him. - Shit. - No way. No way. Let me check your green card again. Keep going, keep going. - There you go. - Thanks for the lift. - Have you got money? - Aye. - Clean hanky? - I'll see you for dinner. All right. - Frankie, leave it out. - Take that, you Fenian bastard. Take that. - Come on. - Come out and fight. I'll get you back. No surrender. Hey, hey- Burke called. Burke called. He wants to talk to you. Everything's set up for next week. He's gonna need the money. One, two, three. Snip, snip, snip. - A delivery for Mr Fitzsimmons. - I can take that for you. Do you need me to sign for it? No. That's fine. Isn't it lovely, the way they glide like that? Not a care in the world. You're from Belfast? You don't know who I am? - I'm Michael's sister. - Michael Doherty's sister? - Megan. - Aye, Megan. - How's your mother? - Oh, you know... not so good, since they killed Michael. - Well, will I be off, then? - Aye, best be getting on with it. All right. Watch yourself, Frankie. I will. You as well, love. Best to you. What I wouldn't have given for that when I was 13. Rory, Mum said dinner's ready. That's a lovely dress you have on there. It's for Morgan's confirmation tomorrow. - Are you married? - No. - Then will you marry me? - I'll have to ask your da. God, what are you doing in there? I need to take a shower. - Wake up, lazybones. - Sheila. Blow-dry your hair somewhere else. I can't take a shower. Get out. It's my confirmation. I deserve to... Oh, my God. You know, you're not gonna look any better. So you might as well just give up. Mum, Morgan just gave me the finger. Would you please tell her not to do that? Tell her to get out of the bathroom. She listens to you. What? Oh, no. Dad. That... That's not... What is wrong...? There's something seriously wrong with this family. In the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You have already been baptised into Christ. And now you will receive the power of his Spirit... and the sign of the Cross on your forehead. You must be witnesses before all the world... to his death, his suffering, his resurrection. Your life must at all times reflect the goodness of Christ. Now that you've come of age, I ask that you renew your baptismal vows. - Do you renounce Satan? - I do. Do you renounce all his earthly works? I do. Do you renounce his empty promises? I do. Do you believe in the Holy Catholic Church... the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins... the resurrection of the body and life everlasting? - I do. - Amen. Hi, Aunt Birdie. - What? - He said hello. - Rory, this is my friend Brooke. - Hi, nice to meet you. - You looked lovely up there. - Thanks. Stop it. - So you lived in Ireland? - Aye. I'll be back in a sec. - Okay. - Bye. - You acted like such a dork. - Did not. - You made... - "Yeah... are you from Ireland?" - No. - No? Corning through. Hot plate here. It's Mum's lasagne - Hey, is the corkscrew there? - Aye. Thank you. You must be the faithful sidekick. I'm the thing that lives beneath the stairs. - Don't I look Irish to you? - Eddie, how you doing? When'd you get here? I'm gonna have a pop. Want a pop? What? Hey, wait. Come here. Come here. Rory, come here. I love these guys. Telephone. In the kitchen. Hello. Frankie, Martin's dead. They got him. We don't know how much they know. You could be next, Frankie. You can't go through with this. This way, please, ladies and gentlemen. The Cloisters is a series of monasteries... that was transported here stone-by-stone... - Where's the judge? - He's scared to death. He thinks if they're onto Martin, they'll be onto him. - He says he wants no part of it. - And the money? He said to hold on to it... not to go through with the daily without some word from Belfast. So is that it, then? Is it finished? By no means is it finished. I'll have to slip back into Belfast. You can't show your face in Belfast. I don't plan on showing my face. Listen, tell me who to see and what to say. I'll go. Given the particular situation, we're gonna have to postpone. That's no problem. Don't worry about it. Make the payment now, and I'll stockpile the stuff for you. I can't do that. The message is to sit tight... till things get worked out back home. - Hey, Billy. - Hey, Mike. How are you? I'll tell you, Rory, I'm sorry about Martin... but these are not soda cans you asked me to get for you. These are no-deposit, no-return items... and I am out of pocket for some very serious dollars. You are putting me in a very awkward position here. I'm sorry, Mr Burke. That's the way it has to be for now. Well, if that's the way it has to be... It's the way it has to be. I have to fly to Dublin, and go up to Belfast to visit my mummy. Then I tell them the three ports that you might come in at. Aye, that's it. Lovely. - Right. - There you have it. Grand. But it isn't just a message, Frankie. I mean, like... Do you ever feel guilty about it? Of course there's guilt. Sleepless nights about some things. No one's innocent in the situation. Everyone has their ghosts. - Are you all right? - Aye. You sure? - Oy, Paddy. - Gee, Sean... Beautiful. All you need now is a house, couple of wee volunteers and a dog. Look at this. Wait till I get around. Take the radio. Hey. Three-five Sergeant. We got a 1032 GLA in progress. Man... A gun. He's got a gun. - Police. Freeze. - Shit. - Are you all right, Eddie? - Yeah, I got the fucker. Hey, hey. Stop. Stop, damn it. Toss it. Toss it, man. Don't make me shoot you. Asshole. Eddie. Okay? Jesus. He was getting away. He's dead, man. Half his face is gone. - What happened? - He was getting away. Then he turned with the gun in the hand. You shot him in the back, Eddie. Here's his gun. He tossed it around the corner. He shot at us, Tommy. He shot at us. - Thanks, Ted. - Yeah, Tom. You did good, Tom. Grand jury's kind of backed up... Yeah. Two or three weeks. You talked to Sheila yet? I'm gonna wait till I get home. - Want a lift? - Tommy. No, I'm okay. - You're Diaz, huh? - Yes, sir. That mutt, you know, he took two shots at me. He broke in... - This your PBA rep? - Yes, he is. Didn't he tell you that you don't have to make a statement for 48 hours? - Yes, he did. - Take his advice. Tommy. Hey, Tommy, how did it go in there? Fine. What does that mean, fine? You shot him in the back, Eddie. He was running away. He didn't have a gun. He shot at us. We're in the police business, Eddie, not the revenge business. Did you cover for me? I'm fine. Just stopped for a few drinks. I didn't want to drive, so... Okay. He's here now. So maybe a half hour or so. Okay. You all right there, Tommy? Had a shooting today, me and Eddie. Eddie killed a guy. - Killed the bad guy? - Not that bad. I saw his sheet. A couple of punk things, but... Poor Eddie. Pull over, man. I think I'm gonna be sick. - You okay, then? - Just give me a minute. You've got The Exorcist here. New York's finest. - Sorry. - It's all right. Can I ask you something? You ever shot anyone? No, I've never shot anyone. I've fired my gun four times on the street. Four times in 23 years. If you pick up a gun, sooner or later someone gets a bullet. Yeah. Big boys' rules. Yeah, what do you know about big boys' rules? Common knowledge, I suppose. You ever shoot anybody? When I was 8, this man came into the house, killed my da. Killed my da in front of us. Jesus. Let's go, please. Aye. I'm sorry about your dad. - Did they get the fuckers? - They are the fuckers. Don't look for happy endings, Tom. It's not an American story. It's an Irish one. What is it? Sheila, that Lopez guy didn't have a gun in his hand when he was shot. - He tossed it. - What? It was nuts out there. Eddie didn't see him toss it. I had the gun in my hand when Eddie shot him. It was a bad call. - Well, you covered for him. - I lied about how it went down. I've thought it through, Sheil. I'm gonna take my pension. Retire. Twenty-three years, and you never took a bribe. You never abused your power. You never treated anyone unfairly. I treated the dead guy unfair. He shot at you. He was stealing radios. He got shot in the back. You don't deserve to get killed for stealing a radio. Tom, it's terrible that he died. But you're not the only cop on the force who's made a mistake. Besides, you didn't make the mistake, Eddie did. I lied. Don't you understand? There are some things I said I would never do. Once, Tom. You did it once. What about next time? I can't do the job this way. - I'm done being a cop. - But you love being a cop. I love you. I love the kids. I love what we got. I don't love being a cop any more. I never told you this. I was the only Irish girl in Brooklyn who didn't wanna marry a cop. I don't wanna go back to work. The kids won't be home for two hours. Well, hell, I'm retired. Yeah. - Hey. - What? Tom. Sheila. Officer needs help. We're at 87 Cornelia Avenue. Now. They're armed. 87 Cornelia Avenue. Sheila. Get out. Get out. - Hey. Get off him, man. - Tom... You get up. Get up. Now. Do it. Easy, man. Easy. Shut up. Get up there against the wall. Get him up against that fucking wall. What do you need? What do you want? You shut your mouth, man. If they get here, things are gonna get a lot more complicated. Now, nobody got hurt. Walk away now. Walk away now. Damn it. Okay, let's get out of here, man. Go now. Let him go. Sheila. You stay right where you are, man. Don't you fucking move, man. Don't you fucking move. Sheila... Sheila. - Let them go. - I'm not going. I'm not going. - Jesus, Tom. - They're leaving. Are you okay? Honey, it's okay. It's okay. Nobody got hurt. - Are you all right? - Aye. Jesus, man. Thanks. About 230, 240. 6'4" or so. The other one was medium. All white guys. - Wearing masks? - Yeah. Just what do you think you're doing? Get him out of here. You're a stupid man, Mr Burke. You're only seeing me standing between you and the money. But you're forgetting... about the thousand other men standing behind me. That's a mistake. Are you with me there, love? Hey, Rory. You might wanna talk to Sean about this. Maybe I'll give him a call. You could give him a call if he was home. But he's not home. You wanna see him? I know he wants to see you. My pearls are still there, and the cash wallet. The TV, the VCR, the computer. Nothing's missing. Call me when you get to your sister's. Yeah. You got a rain cheque. I owe you one. I'll have the girls call you tonight. Go get the money, and we can do the deal. There's a warehouse at 12th and Hudson. I'll be waiting, okay? And please don't fuck around, or I'll kill your friend. Stupid man. Jesus. I'll explain when you get here. I need you, Eddie. Okay. Who are you? Did you bring this into my house? Aye. Where'd you go when you left here? I went to make sure it wouldn't happen again. It was all lies, wasn't it? Everything you told us. Except for how I feel about you and your family. That wasn't a lie. I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen. I just... I'm in a bind. I don't have time to explain. I'll just... I'll get my gear and I'll clear out. What's the money for? I was thinking guns. I was thinking IRA. - I need that money, Tom. - Why? So other 8-year-old can watch their fathers gunned down in front of them? If this money leaves here, more people will die. Can you tell me that won't happen? Let me ask you, what if tonight everything you had... was burned down around you? What if you and yours walked out on the street and you were spat on? Told you were nothing. You're no good. What if it was one of yours cut down by a plastic bullet? One of yours you had to bury? Would you just sit back and say, "Oh, well? Remember Annie? She was such a sweet one. God bless her." You try to make some kind of sense of it. You fucking try. You look around at all the people, and you realise... you're dealing with a government that's fooled everyone. All sides. Normal people in a normal situation find it a disgusting, ugly war... that you can't understand, because you haven't lived it. I'm sorry it's going badly between us. You're a good man. But understand, I have to go. I'm also a cop, and I can't let you go. I'm going, Tom. Tommy? Come on, Eddie. Cuff him. You drive. Jesus, look at this. It's this trash thing. I'm a police officer. I'm gonna have to ask you to move this vehicle. I can't do it. You're gonna have to move the truck. - We got a guy... - You move it. Move, move, move. Don't. - What kind of animal is this? - A bear. What kind of noise does a bear make? Hello. - And what kind of animal is this? - An owl. That's right. And what kind of noise does an owl make? That's right. When do owls come out? In the night-time. Something terrible's happened. Tommy. There's some people here to see you. FBI. - This is Sergeant Thomas O'Meara. - Sergeant. I'm Evan Stanley, this is Art Fisher. New York Field Office, FBI. We'd like to ask you a few questions about Frankie McGuire. - Who's Frankie McGuire? - Francis Boston McGuire... a.k.a. Frankie the Angel. Born July 27, 1964. Belfast, Northern Ireland. From December, 1985 he was a unit commander. Falls Road Active Service Unit, Belfast Brigade... Provisional Irish Republican Army. Wanted for the crime of murder. Thirteen British soldiers. Eleven police officers. One thing I'm not clear about. Exactly what is your relationship to this terrorist, Sergeant O'Meara? - Who are you? - Hany Sloan, sergeant... British Intelligence. - You are Irish. - So is Cardinal O'Connor. I've been tracking these murderous bastards for nearly two years. He's the last of them. A month ago, we were informed he had surfaced in New York. I have been given the authority by both my government and yours... to use any means necessary to bring closure to this issue. You wanna talk to me again... you read me my rights. Tom, I want you to cooperate with these people. Don't piss your career away over this. They're not gonna bring him in. They're gonna kill him. Money, the missiles. Where's Sean? I have to see him. What do you think? You're gonna fuck with me, you bog-Irish hick. Fuck with me? I think not. You're on your own here, laddie. You know it. I know it. And I guarantee you Sean knows it. Get him. Give us the money. You're a stupid man, Mr Burke. Sweet dreams. Frankie. My mind's been racing a hundred miles an hour since I heard. I've got a plan. You know my sister and her husband, John McDonagh? They live in San Francisco. We'll get you on the train. They'll sort you out. - There's no sorting me out. - There is. I killed a cop. That's why you've got to go there. - I leave tonight. - Going where? - Back home. - Frankie, are you mad? We've got enough martyrs. We don't need another one. I'm gonna take that boat and ram it straight up their arse. I need you to tell them I'm coming. Look, I'm not saying you have to give it up. I'm saying lay low for a while, until the whole thing quietens down. If you wanna fight, you have to stay alive. - You're no use to anyone dead. - Seanie's dead. Christ. I leave tonight. - Yes? - Is the boss in? I'm afraid he's otherwise occupied. Police business. - Tom, how are you? - Not so good. Tom, I had no idea. I called you as soon as I got the news. I was at the hospital with Eddie. I'm so sorry about Eddie. Tom, I sponsor dozens of these kids. I should've checked his background. Maybe I'm stupid, but I just can't put it together. What's it for? The money? What's all that fucking money for? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm racking my brain. The only thing I can think of is guns. Like the one my wife had jammed in her face. You know there were guys with ski masks and guns in my house? Did you know that? Tom, why don't you go home? Get some rest. I'm sorry, Peter. I will go home. I'm tired. As soon as I lock him up. Do me one more favour. Tell me... - where is he? - I don't know. Where is he? I'll put your head right through this fucking wall. Hey. Hey. Stop. Hey. I just wanna talk to you. Come here. Open the door. God damn. I just wanna talk to you. - Where is he? - He's not here. Don't you touch him. Leave him alone. - Rory. - Keep away from me, Tom. What's your name? Megan Doherty. He's away, Megan. I'm Tom O'Meara. Rory's been staying with us. Did he tell you? I understand why he's doing what he's doing. If I had to endure what he's endured... If I was 8 years old and saw my father gunned down in front of my family... I'd be carrying a gun too... but I wouldn't be wearing a badge. I'm not gonna lie to you, Megan. I'm hereto bring him in. He killed a cop. The FBI is after him. The guys he was doing business with here are after him. There's an SAS agent... who has tracked down and killed every other member of his unit. He doesn't have to die. But if you wanna see him again, you got to help me find him. I promise you I'll do everything I can to bring him in alive. Mr O'Meara. Hold it. Let me see your hands. - I've got to bring you in, son. - I'm not going back, Tom. The killing's got to stop, Frankie. Then you'll have to kill to stop it. It gets a bit complicated, doesn't it? Nobody has to get killed. - Go home to your family, Tom. - Don't move. I'm not going back. I told you. I warned you. Did I tell you my da was a fisherman? Yeah. He loved the rocking of the sea. He said there was no more peaceful way of going to sleep. You're a good man, Tom. Hang on, Rory. I'll get you to shore. - Hang on, kid. - I told you... it's not an American story. It's an Irish one. We never had a choice. You and I.
