The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade, no matter what. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1900,4100)} All the stars in the sky await you. Starting a foolish war, people have covered world with ice, brought it close to destruction. Less than 100 000 people were left on the planet. For a long time no one even tried to count us anymore. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,3600,3900)}Who knows how many of us were really left. Step for step... I've grown old, my body is not listening to me anymore. With every year my load has become heavier and heavier. I haven't got much time left... But one regret remains. Something that's important not just for me. So... I want to tell about it no matter what... Lebi! Yob! Ruts! Lebi! Yob! Ruts! Geez, where did they go... Knowing that they can't go outside for a long time!.. Can't help it. They won't listen at that age. Izaya! This is a big problem! I know. Anyway let's go check the mills. They must be hiding somewhere. Right. We should check it quickly, before storm starts again... Elemiya! We are going to northern one! Come on! {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1200,1500)}Yes! They went to check the mills. Yep. Did they see us? Should we end this... What are you talking about? We decided it together. Yob! Look out! There might be some holes! All right! All right! See? I've told you... Alright? Hey! Stop it! As I thought, yesterdays' storm was strong. The northern mill is seriously damaged. If we won't help, they'll be mad... Yeah. Too late! We decided to play while coming outside! Well, yeah... Why are we hiding..?! Ouch... Stumbled again!.. Second time?.. Yob, move your legs. Wha?! What is this? Wood. A part of something?.. Let's dig! Hey... This is... Yeah... It's a man. Um... How did he get there? I don't know! Yob! Call the adults! What?! But they'll know that we are..! No time for that! Come on! Run! Got it! Do you think he's still alive? Well... Ah! His Mask is moving a bit! He's breathing. True! Good! He'll be ok! What is.. this?.. {\t(1300,2400,\pos(952,412)\t(0,3450,\fade(255,0,255,0,1400,7250,8700)}PLANETARIAN {\bord0\c&HB84336&\t(0,1100,\c&H000000&)\fade(255,0,255,0,1000,6200,7550)\move(958,684,958,726,0,1600)}~ STARGAZER ~ Are you awake? Am I?.. Are you feeling well? You were found unconscious near this place. I remember... The storm got me... Please lie down. No, it's alright. I've been saved. Thank you so much. You saved... my life. This is... A shelter that survived the war. It's below an old church. We've been using it for a long time now. Our last men died a few years ago. Now we are on the verge of extinction, about twenty of us. Here, warm up. Thank you. Elemiya. You may go. Go to the kids and tell them that he has woken up. Yes. They'll be relieved. So warm. I'm feeling alive. You don't look very well. What brings you to these forgotten lands? You are not a scavenger. Yeah. I've been looking for something for a long time. That.. thing... Someone told me it could be found in these lands. Getting through the mountains isn't fun for an old man like me... But... Even if I wouldn't find anything, I don't want to regret anything. Hoh? It's rare to see you praying. We are asking the Goddess for help! "Please help him!" Looks like it did help after all. The man you saved has just woken up. Really, Elemiya?! The residental area of Elublanka was destroyed. It's been that way for four years. Is that so... There are no valuable areas left in this region so no merchants have appeared here for ten years. Can you tell us about the situation in the other villages? This land is not overly polluted by radiation, but DNA mutation effects can bee seen everywhere. Hey! Don't push me! Tss! Have patience! You're right, this place is no exception. Nevertheless, the children are a great treasure to us. Lebi, Yob, Ruts. Stop eavesdropping there and come in. We got caught! Yob you were too loud! Oh, you are... I was told you were the ones who saved me. You have my gratitude. Thank you. Ezula always said that we should help people in trouble. Were are you from? From another village? From far away? Well... I've come from far away. By now, I've spent a lot of time travelling.. ..have been in a lot of places in the world. Wow!.. Does that thing pique your interest? Yes. Is that some kind of bomb? No, it's not a dangerous thing. That's a device that shows you the stars. Stars?.. Stars?! Tell me, are you the "Stargazer"? M-m? Yes. Oh! I've heard about you when was young! It was my dream to meet you! I wouldn't have thought my dream would come true at my age anymore. Ezula, the "Stargazer"? What does "stars" mean? Oh, you've never heard about stars? Guess not. Is that so! Well, that's to be expected. When I was young, I haven't known them either. I had to survive.. ..had no time for the stars. Meeting those kids, made me remember my goals, I remembered meeting with that android girl... The place where I met her was a sarcophagus city... These damn tin cans sure don't let up, huh?! Anti-personnel tanks are still defending their territory from intruders, unaware that their city has long since been reduced to nothing but rubble and ruins. A military installation? I was searching for preserved foods, medical supplies, precision tools, weapons, ammunition, and so on. Anything I could use. That was the job of those who called themselves Junkers. Working electricity? Here? This place doesn't look military. Congratulations! You are our 2,500,000th customer! What the hell is a {\alpha&HFFH&}girl doing in a place like this? What the hell is a girl doing in a place like this? What do you want? I apologize. I humbly, humbly apologize. I was being quite dishonest.. To be precise, you are the 2,487,288th customer. Actually, that's not entirely accurate either. Some time ago, I made an exception and let a little boy and little girl in when they didn't have enough for the admission fee. So technically, you are the 2,487,290th customer. I sincerely apologize... Um, Mr. Customer? You are our first customer in exactly 29 years and 81 days. Welcome to the rooftop planetarium of the Flowercrest Department Store! Are you a robot? Yes! I am a robot. I am a member of staff at this institution. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2000,2300)}My name is Hoshino Yumemi What the hell is that? It is a bouquet. Please accept this in commemoration of your visit here. A bouquet, huh? My apologies! I was not able to acquire real flowers for you. My phone calls to the florist on the first floor have not been connecting lately. So I tried making one myself. Are you malfunctioning? Yes. I am malfunctioning just a little bit. There currently exists an unidentified bug in my self-diagnostic subroutines. My backup CMOS battery is depleted and must be replaced. My cervical vertebral power unit is past its operational lifespan and must be replaced. There also exists known issues with my personal information databases and my conversation subroutines. Because of them, a unique characteristic of this unit is its tendency to engage in verbose conversation without proper consideration of time. You gotta be kidding me... Um, Mr. Customer? Are you perhaps not feeling well? May I escort you to our department store's medical office? Mr. Customer? Mr. Customer? Shut up. I'm neither a customer, nor am I sick. Is that so? Well then, the next projection will begin in seven minutes. Please take a seat and wait patiently until then. Does this thing ever shut up? Let me repeat myself. I am not a customer. Is that so? But since you are here anyway, by all means, please view the projection. Shut up. The projection is only 45 minutes long. Look, just shut up. Oh, and I am most sorry, but smoking during the projection is... Shut up! Keep your mouth shut! Please, just stop talking! Understood. Request acknowledged. My god. Um, Mr. Customer. There is one request I would like to make before I stop talking. Look at that, your silence lasted for all of three seconds. If it is not too much trouble, please take this. I would like you to view the special projection, reserved in commemoration of the 2,500,000th customer. How about it? Do whatever you want. Thank you very much. Well then, I shall go prepare the projection, so please be patient. Wait a sec. Yes? Is there something I can help you with? What are you going to show me? A holovid? The starry sky. The starry sky? That is correct. The starry sky. The starry sky, huh? I've only got two left... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1000,1300)}What? Thank you all for coming to Flowercrest Department Store's rooftop planetarium today. My name is Hoshino Yumemi, and I am a member of staff at this institution. Before the projection begins, I would like to announce a few important things. Please do not talk or whisper during the projection, as this would be a disturbance to the other customers. Maybe if I dry this, I can still use it... Please turn off your cell phones and any alarms now. In addition, please do not eat, drink, or smoke at any time during the projection. And finally, I would like to introduce a most important partner who will take you all into the world of the stars. Everyone, please welcome her with a warm round of applause! I present to you Miss Jena! To tell you the truth... Miss Jena is... the name of this big machine! Um, Mr. Customer? You are supposed to laugh here. You expected me to laugh? Cut the crap and just start the damn thing already. Thank you. I am very grateful that you are anticipating it this much. Anticipating, my ass... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,5700,6000)}Now then, without further ado, Miss Jena will greet you all! And once again. Miss Jena will greet you all! I thought you were gonna show me the stars. Um, Mr. Customer... I apologize. I sincerely, sincerely apologize! I am ashamed to be telling you this, but it seems that our projector is in a state of serious breakdown. Mr. Manager and the rest of the staff are on a trip, and a simple unit such as myself could not possibly grasp the situation... Whatever. I don't give a damn. Do you know what the most irritating thing is when venturing into that sarcophagus city? The most irritating thing in that sarcophagus city... was, without a doubt, the time I met that robot. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,3600,3900)}Even if it talks to you, don't respond to it. Gave me a heart attack. The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade, no matter what. All the stars in the sky await you. Why don't you come to the planetarium? Good afternoon, Mr. Customer. How are you feeling? Been worse. I just fell asleep, is all. I guess I have about an hour before sunset... Mr. Customer, you must love the stars. What makes you think that? You are wearing a pendant with a constellation design. That is Cygnus, the Swan. This? I'll be going now. Sorry to bother you. Mr. Customer? If you wait 18 more minutes, the next projection will begin. That device is broken though, right? That device? Do you mean Miss Jena? Yeah. Yes, Miss Jena is currently out of order. But I expect repairs to be done, if you wait for just a short while. Sorry, waiting's not my strong suit. In that case, how about shopping in our department store while repairs are being conducted? There are some great discount coupons I can print out for you. There's no one here. Who the hell's gonna fix that piece of junk? There is no reason for concern. I have already put in a request for the repair team. They should be here soon, and will begin repairs immediately. Apparently the concept of a rhetorical question is beyond her... Um, Mr. Customer? Could it be that you are not feeling well? If that is the case, I can escort you to the medical— Enough. Pardon me for asking, but what do you mean by "enough"? I mean, I get it. I'll be downstairs. Call me when your repairs are done. Yes, understood. Who would've thought getting out of here would be so much trouble... Thank you very much. I am glad to hear that. To tell you the truth, I was quite worried since I thought that you had become displeased because I made a careless mistake. We robots take joy in serving humans and putting you at ease. We're happy when we're doing it well! When the projector is repaired, I will broadcast the news over the building's PA system. We have a special projection prepared just for you, so please don't hesitate to remind me upon your return. Sure. You will be the first customer to view the special projection. Every member of our staff gave their best effort to produce it, so I too, will perform my role in this without a single mistake. Additionally, I will keep your bouquet safe with the utmost care as well. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2900,3200)}I shall patiently await your return. I don't even know why I'm doing this. What I do know is that,now that the sun has set, venturing out is dangerous. Also, this primitive contraption is a lot more complex than it looks. Mr. Customer, how long do you estimate it will take for your repairs on Miss Jena to be complete? Hell if I know. Ain't got a clue. Will it be fixed in time for tomorrow's 11:00 am projection? I highly doubt it. If that is the case, may I put out a notice that tomorrow's projections will be postponed? Do whatever you want. Acknowledged. I will register this as a critical directive. Hey... This light bulbs' filament is burned out. Is there a spare— Mr. Customer. I apologize for the inconvenience, but it is almost midnight. As per protocol, I will be switching into sleep mode. The reboot from sleep mode is scheduled for 9:00am. Remaining operation time after reboot will be 75 hours. Well then, good night. Hey, wait... God damn it. Mr. Customer. Mr. Customer. Mr. Customer. Good morning, Mr. Customer. Were you the one calling me? Yes, sir. I was dreaming. Oh, how wonderful! Was it pleasant? Not at all... As I am a robot, I am incapable of dreaming. But how shall I put it? I have very much longed to experience it! Most dreams are not worth longing after. Most dreams are not worth longing after. Is that so? Wait a sec. So you're saying you're only operational for one week out of the entire year? Yes. For the past 30 years, the quantity of electricity delivered to this department store has declined sharply. As per protocol, I have activated my energy-saving mode. Two days ago at 9:00 am, I became operational for the first time in 8601 hours. Just as I happened to be passing through. Talk about bad timing... Five days from now, at midnight, I will return to hibernation mode for recharging. I see. To think the emergency power's still running after all that's happened... By the way, Mr. Customer, what do you intend to do with that rainwater? Drink it. Unlike you, I'll die if I don't drink water. If you'd like, I could prepare a beverage for you. A beverage? To tell you the truth, brewing tea is one of my specialties. Or perhaps you'd prefer a freshly ground coffee? Coffee, huh... How about alcohol, then? I'm talking bottled distilled liquor with unbroken seals. It's actually very important to me. Certainly, we have those in stock. Really?! Where?! Our department store has several vendors located on B1 that sell high-grade liquor... Yeah, yeah, I get the idea. Of course. In that case, Mr. Customer, may I inquire about Miss Jena and her current state of repairs? No change from last night. I'm still working on it. I see... In that case, I will go and announce the cancellation of today's projection. Hey, do you have spare light bulbs stored away somewhere? Hey, do you have spare light bulbs stored away somewhere? Recently, two of the latest 905 series have been assigned to the help desk at the main entrance. Being FT models, they both have a much more adult appearance compared to myself. Their faceplates are quite detailed, and they even feature the capability to shed tears. Tears, huh. Try turning it on. Understood. This one's okay... So what, you can't shed tears? Correct. Tear-generation functionality was first introduced in the predecessor models, the 9000 series. I see. Good for them. Switch on. Understood. This one's busted. Guess I have two usable ones... By the way, may I remove this cable now? This is a shameful emergency measure that I should not be showing to customers... Wait a bit longer. I wanna try the motors. Understood. By the way, Mr. Customer. What is it now? How does shedding tears feel? Can't really say. When I'm crying, I'm usually not thinking very clearly. Is that so? I do not know how to put this, but I would very much like to be able to shed tears. As I am an Economy Edition model, I lack that functionality. Let's just say you're not really missing out on anything. Is that so? Yeah, no doubt about it. All righty. Move the latitude axis upwards, bit by bit. Yes, sir. For your safety, please evacuate from the radius of revolution. Mr. Customer, might you have an estimated time of completion for the repairs of Miss Jena? Who knows? Do you think it will be in time for tomorrow's 11:00 am projection? Dunno. Feel free to pray to God. Which god should I pray to, then? What'd you say? For instance, there are the ancient Greek gods: Zeus, Athena, Apollo, Hermes, Artemis, Demeter, Poseidon, Hades... You sure know a lot. Just pick your favorite or whatever. Understood. In that case, I shall pray to Dionysus. Who the hell is that? The god of wine and fertility, also known by his Roman name, Bacchus. I felt that this god would surely be most to your liking, Mr. Customer. Well, you're not too far off... Pray to your god, not mine. My god? The god of robots. The information you have requested does not match any entry in my database. I see. However, I have found something related. This is from a meeting we had about the mythological heavens, which we featured as a special presentation. I have the file saved as a hologram. Is there a heaven for robots? Of course there is! There has to be! Right, manager? Ah, yes, that's right. What is that place like? Well... It's free of malfunctions and batteries never decay! Right? Huh? Um, yeah, and no software bugs or any need to replace parts, I heard. You'll be granted all your other wishes too! Is that so? Yes, yes. I see. The god you're looking for is the one in that robot heaven. Keep that in mind. Understood. Critical data registered. Understood. Critical data registered. I am very pleased to have learned about this god. In fact, I have a wish I would like to ask the God of Robots to grant. A wish? What could you possibly want? Well, it is about Heaven... What is it? I apologize for the inconvenience, but it is almost midnight. As per protocol, I will be switching into sleep mode. It's gotten that late already? Reboot from sleep mode is scheduled for 9:00 am. Remaining operation time after reboot will be 60 hours. Well then, good night. Why don't you come to the planetarium? The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade, no matter what. All the stars in the sky await... Hey, I'm done. Mr. Customer, are you saying that you have completed your repairs on Miss Jena? Yeah, that's right. I've done all I can. Thank you all for coming to Flowercrest Department Stores' rooftop planetarium today. My name is Hoshino Yumemi, and I am a member of staff at this institution. Before the projection begins, I would like to announce a few important things. Please do not talk or whisper during the projection, as this would be a disturbance to the other customers. Please turn off your cell phones and any alarms now. In addition, please do not eat, drink, or smoke at any time during the projection. And finally, I would like to introduce a most important partner who will take you all into the world of the stars. Everyone, please welcome her with a warm round of applause! I present to you Miss Jena! To tell you the truth... Miss Jena is... the name of this big machine! Now then, without further ado, Miss Jena will greet all of you! Today, our planetarium was visited by the 2,487,290th visitor since we first opened. On behalf of all the staff of our establishment, I offer you our humblest gratitude. In commemoration of this special occasion, we have prepared a special projection. We hope that you will all enjoy it. On one fine autumn day, it was raining outside. Rainy days can make you feel a little down. But please be at ease. In here, we can summon the Sun whenever we wish. Here we have our very own Sun. Slowly, it sets in the western sky. Ah, here is the first celestial body to grace our night sky: Venus, also known as the Evening Star. Slowly but surely, the sky is growing darker. This is our signal to go home. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,4600,4900)}At last, the curtain of night slowly falls over the vicinity... This is the starry sky at 8:00 pm tonight. Crossing the ceiling above you right now is the Milky Way, so named by civilizations of old who saw it as a river of milk flowing through the sky. Now, if you could focus your attention on the highest star, the one set at the ceiling of the sky. That is Deneb, the first magnitude star of the constellation Cygnus. Close by are Vega of the constellation Lyra, and Altair of Aquila. Together, these three make up what is called the Summer Triangle. So far, these have all been summer constellations. Although today has been a very chilly day, if you turn your eyes upward towards the night sky, you can still find these final traces of summer. Now then, shall we turn our attention to the autumn constellations? Please look a little east of Deneb. The winged horse is Pegasus, and the chained princess is Andromeda. The autumn constellations are accompanied by a famous legend. It's like the stars are drawing me in. Andromeda is the heroine. Andromeda was the daughter of the ancient Ethiopian king Cepheus and his queen, Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia boasted about her daughter's beauty so greatly, she invoked the wrath of Poseidon, god of the ocean. Angered, Poseidon sent a giant sea monster to the shores of Ethiopia. Ethiopia was devastated by the tidal wave caused by the sea monster. Cepheus received an oracle saying that to calm Poseidon, he must sacrifice his daughter Andromeda. Cepheus was torn, but Andromeda volunteered to sacrifice herself. Reluctantly, Cepheus set aside his sorrows and chained Andromeda to a rock by the coast. As she lay there trembling all alone, the sea rose up. The sea monster had appeared, and it was closing in on Andromeda. Struggling as she might, the chains would not let go. "Save me! Somebody save me!" In her mind, Andromeda desperately called for help. And then, at that very moment! Riding atop the winged horse Pegasus, the hero Perseus arrived. Perseus was on his way back from his victorious battle against the Gorgon, Medusa. Noticing that something was amiss with the shore, he moved closer to check. Right now, in this very world, she was an omnipotent storyteller, and the stars were her little garden. Princesses, heroes, monsters, and gods... Each and every one of them bowed devotedly before her, playing their individual parts in the unfolding drama with absolute obedience. And thus did Andromeda and Perseus become constellations, living happily ever after in the autumn sky to this day. Let us now turn to our special projection. It is named "The Reverie of Mankind Spreading Its Wings Into Space"... What's wrong? Did something break? Or could it be... There's the fuse board. Mr. Customer, Miss Jena is not responding. Neither the projectors nor the axes are activating. What kind of tools will we require to repair Miss Jena? The power's... been cut off. My sincerest apologies, but I do not understand. Somehow, this facility, by some sort of miracle received a weak stream of electrical power over the past 30 years. But that's come to an end. So, you mean there's a power outage? In that case, the emergency power will come online soon enough. This place has been supplied by said emergency power the whole time. We're out of options. We're out of options. Um, Mr. Customer, then does this mean that the special projection... Listen closely to what I say. Listen closely to what I say. Yes, sir. Continue the projection. Your voice alone will suffice. My sincerest apologies, but I do not understand. I said, continue. I don't need the projector. I just want to hear your explanations and commentary. Can you do that? Yes, I certainly can. But if it is just my commentary alone, then that will not be a projection. It's okay. I know all about the stars already. I'll be able to understand everything you want to show me just from you speaking. You must be very fond of the stars, Mr. Customer. I am truly honored to have you as a customer of our humble establishment. Yeah. In that case, very well. We will continue the projection through my explanations alone. This way, please. She really is trusting. I shall now resume the special projection. A very, very, very long time ago... Huddled within cold, dark caves, the earliest forefathers of humanity lived together. The world was locked in ice, and huge, tusked beasts still roamed the land. One long, freezing night, a young man woke up. Likely due to a combination of the bitter cold and gnawing hunger, he was unable to sleep. He rubbed his sleepy eyes, and peered outside at the entrance of the cave. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,5300,6500)}Upon the freezing night sky, countless numbers of stars twinkled brightly. Ever since that day, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,4700,5000)}mankind has never ceased to gaze up at the heavens in all its vastness with wonder. Was there ever any doubt that humanity would set its sights beyond the sky, towards space itself? Towards unknown heights? Breaking free of the darkness of night... Taking the tears of many, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,3300,3600)}and forging them into the seeds of new dreams... And finally, on one fateful day, those hands reached out into space. Here is the third planet of the solar system. Our planet, Earth. No matter where on Earth you look, our planet is teeming with beauty. but currently, there are many disputes, conflicts, and problems that can't yet be resolved. Overpopulation, energy, food, space territoriality. However, it is my sincere belief that mankind will be able to solve all of its problems. And then, they will reach out to the heavens above. On this special night, I would like to let you in on a big secret. This planetarium is also a time machine! It allows us to traverse time at will, from the distant past into the furthest reaches of the future. Please take a look. This is the starry sky that will be seen precisely one thousand years from this day, in this very place. Miss Jena the projector, and I, Hoshino Yumemi the robot, did our best to construct this meager starry sky of the future. Please, everyone, don't forget the starry sky that you saw here. If you ever find yourself lost in the darkness, no longer able to see the real starry sky, please remember it. This is... {\alpha&HFFH&}my little reverie. This is... my little reverie. Well then, let us return to our own day and age. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1800,2100)}The celestial spheres are revolving. The winter constellations are appearing above the eastern horizon. Orion, Auriga, Taurus... These are the harbingers of a magnificent season that will soon be unfolding every night. The long night has finally ended, and morning has once again come to the world. The sun has risen. {\t(3300,4200,\3c&HFFFFFF&)}The twittering of small birds and the rustling of the wind are now audible. The slumbering buildings and trees, too, are sleepily opening their eyes to greet the rays of the sun. Very soon, the town will spring to life, and just as ever, a new day will begin. Good morning, everyone. That marks the end of our special projection. It has been an honor to have you join me, Hoshino Yumemi, on this journey. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2700,3000)}Thank you for listening so attentively. Mr. Customer, today's projection is over. Today's projection is over. Mr. Customer? Mr. Customer? It would seem he has fallen asleep. After taking all the factors into account, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,4400,4700)}I think that it would be best to allow Mr. Customer to sleep like this until morning. Mr. Customer, Mr. Manager once told me that it's a great privilege for a human being to be able to sleep beneath the starry sky. This is why I believe that surely, you must have enjoyed the special projection, Mr. Customer. That brings me much joy I wonder what kind of dream you are having? In the world without shining stars, {\an8\fade(0,0,255,0,0,3000,3300)}I'm a robot and can't have dreams... she showed me a night with a starry sky, {\t(4000,4300,\3c&H000000&)}that will stay in my memory forever. What is a "Stargazer"? Is he different from Junkers? Well, yeah... I think he is different. He doesn't sell anything. Ezula was very happy. She was praying to the old man, as if to the Goddess! We are honored to have you here, Stargazer. Really? Ezula?.. If only he were a bit younger... in this case we can't think about making a child. Stop it, Izaya! It's not about that! Hey, Elemiya... What's a star? Eh?! Well... Like Sun, Moon, and other stuff like that. Sun? Moon?.. Is he a person who sells light bulbs? No. I don't mean that Sun is a light bulb, It's something that exist outside But we went outside a while back, and we didn't see any sun. There's nothing like that anywhere. That's because... I don't understand. Where is the Stargazer from? Did he come from the stars? No, that's not it. The Stargazer is also just an ordinary man. If he is an ordinary man, why's he called the Stargazer? Why's he travelling like the Junkers? Hmm... Why?! Why?! Izaya, even you?! It's a joke! I'm a bit confused with all those questions! Are you doing your job well? We are! Yes! Our best! Elemiya, Izaya. I've heard that our harvest didn't go well this year. What about fertilizers? Potatoes are growing well but vegetables... I see. We'll keep trying! I'm counting on you. Got it! Lebi, Yob, Ruts. Come with me. Uh?.. The Stargazer wants to see you. Can I make a request? Request? Do you know what an umbrella is? Hmm?.. It's something used to protect you from the rain or the snow. But you probably don't know what that is. I've seen one on a painting before. I'd like you to help me make a very big umbrella. I lost the one I was using before. Is it going to be used outside? No, it's to be used indoors. Is there some big place, where we can put up a big umbrella? Maybe the hall? {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2100,2400)}Yep, no one will be against that! I can't cut it well... That length should be enough, but make the other ones a bit longer every time. Can you tell us what we are making now? The umbrella, Lebi! He told us at the beginning! Isn't it something used to protect from the rain and snow? It doesn't rain or snow indoors! This isn't an umbrella. But... Well... I see. Do you want to know what it really is? Yes! This is outer space. Outer space?.. To be precise, it's a model of a part of outer space. Of course, the real thing isn't that small... But if it's too big, I can't carry it around. That's why I only make it this big. What is outer space? It is far, far away beyond the sky, the place where the stars exist. Far away? How far? Good question. This is... Are you okay?! I... I'll go for Ezula! No, I'm okay. I'm sorry... I'd like to answer your questions... But can I answer that question a bit later? Yes. Thanks. Well then let's continue making an umbrella. Lebi! Ruts! Hurry! It'll be ready soon! Not so fast, Yob! We still have to work on the fields! {\t(2100,2950,\3c&HFFFFFF&)}I know! Did you hear? He forced the kids to make something. Yeah. That old man? Using scraps of cloth... What is it, Yob? Shh! With this much, we could make a lot of clothes instead... Not just cloth, He'll become another mouth to feed! What do we get from an old man that can't make kids. If only he were a 30 years younger... That's right! I'll be back soon... Lebi?! Yob, don't. But?! Our adults are having hard times now. But talking like that about him?! You're right. Ezula always says, that we should help people in trouble. Why are they saying such things? I... I don't know... Feels strange! You made a great umbrella even on your your first try. Yes, it's very good. Lebi, Yob. Hang black curtains from the edge of the umbrella, so that light can't enter. And then.. ..we should prepare that device, Ruts. Eh?.. That's it, should be enough grease now. Slowly. Got it. Yob! There should be no gaps! I know! Are you okay? I can switch with you any time. All okay! I'm doing it better than you! A projector is always hard to please, and it's always in a bad condition. It is a very sensitive device. No matter which generation it is, or what kind of projector it is. You are doing it very well. Really? Yes. Now hold and press that spring. Like this? Very good. Now try to continue setting it up using this book. Eh? I...{\alpha&HFFH&} Can't do that... I... Can't do that... Don't worry. I'll be watching over you. Try it. Well, since this book is handwritten by me you might not be able to read it. I'm bad at handwriting. Got it! I'll try! To start the motor and light it up, we should spin a handle. If it's not enough, we can charge it at any time. Ok! Should I take over? It's alright! Leave it to me! When you're done, we can try it out. What's that? The Moon. The brightest and biggest object in the night sky. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2300,2600)}This is... stars?.. Impossible! It's, It's just too beautiful! {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1000,1300)}Yes! Wh... Why are they lined up so nicely like that? The stars elsewhere look more scattered. Taking a deep breath after looking at such beauty, their curiosity grew. Like mine. I'll answer your questions as much as I can. Look there! Looks like when Elemiya goes mad! One question after another. First yours, Lebi. Stars in alignment are called a constellation. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2100,3600)}In ancient times people looked at them... Okay, shall we finish for today? I want to hear a bit more! Tell us about stars! Yeah! We don't know when we can see it again! Tomorrow we are going to the fields... Don't worry about that. Try closing your eyes. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,4700,5000)}Now imagine the night sky you have seen just now. Do you get it? You'll never forget the stars that you saw at the planetarium. This is it - the stars. Good night! Bye! {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1300,1600)}We'll come again! Are you alright? Oh, it is you. Do you want to look at the stars? Some time in the future. With the others. What about your cough? My lungs are not good. How bad is it? I'm lucky to have lived this long. Dealing for so long with my regrets, all thanks to my stubborn body. Will it support me a for bit longer?.. If you didn't come to look at the stars, what can I do for you? Oh right... I'd like to share some good things with you. Thank you. It's been a long time!.. They did a good job. Doing this with such great enthusiasm. They'll grow up very well. It's a miracle. How bad it is in other areas? Some treat all strangers as enemies... Others think only about children. Compared to them, this place shows peace and happiness. In such dark times that's the most valuable thing. Hearing that, I'm glad that my contribution to this place was valuable... But as you can see they have no future staying at our village. Elder. I have a request for you. What is it?. Could you leave those kids to me? I want to grow my inheritors. They will be better Stargazers than me. Smart, honest, innocent... They could make many things in the future... That's what I think. Every morning we have a meeting. I'll tell them about it. But... even if they agree, ultimately, it'll be the kids' decision. Of course. Thank you so much. Yob! Wake up, Yob! Remember yesterday! Hurry! Oh! Right! M?.. Where are you going? Elemiya?! What! What is it?! No, nothing. Trying to escape again? No! We'll have an important meeting soon, so don't charge off. Are we going too? Adults only. This time they might be calling your teacher. Izaya! Are you going to look at the stars? Maybe... Lebi! Ruts! Let's go! Yep! We'll be back soon! Don't go outside! Come back soon! Got it! Hi! Ah, you guys. Come in. Yes. We... We have a request! Oh, what is it? We want to become Stargazers! I bet Ruts can make the machine. He can maintain it too. Yes! If we have to go to other villages on a sled, we have Yob for that I'll be the one showing the stars to the others. But, I don't think I can do it... until I learn more. So! Please teach us more so we can become better Stargazers. We'll give you this in exchange. This is our treasure. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,3000,3300)}It may not be enough, but... Don't worry about that. This is more than enough. Really?! I also have a request for you. Request? Mm?.. I want you to take this. This is my treasure... ...which changed my life. Why don't you come to the planetarium? The beautiful twinkling of eternity that will never fade, no matter what. All the stars in the sky await... Good afternoon, Mr. Customer. How are you feeling? Not particularly good, but not too shabby either. I see. If you are still feeling ill, by any chance... I'm fine. I see. I am most relieved to hear that. My sincerest apologies for the breakdown during the projection. I offer you the sincerest apologies from the bottom of my heart. Well... Your projection{\alpha&HFFH&} wasn't half bad. Your projection wasn't half bad. I am overjoyed to hear such a compliment. It is also true that you have helped us out a great deal. Say... Just what do you... What is it? It's nothing. I'm heading off now. Very well. Thank you for everything. Offer a prayer for my sake so that I'll survive the trip back. To the God of Robots, I mean. Certainly. Mr. Customer. Excuse me, but may I ask you a question? What is it? Will you be in any danger on your journey home? I could say no, but that would probably be a lie. Will you be taking the train on your way home? The trains aren't running. There's a power outage right now, remember? Then will you be taking a bus or a taxi or some other kind of vehicle? A car, probably. Is your car parked within a three-kilometer radius of here? Sounds about right. Why are you asking me all this? I have attempted to contact the support center and have requested a release to act upon our professional code, but I am unable to connect. As such, I am permitted to act at my own discretion. I will escort you to your car, Mr. Customer. The duty of escorting the unwell falls upon us robots. Are you crazy? No, but I am malfunctioning just slightly. I'm looking at two, maybe three kilometers by foot. How long will your batteries last? In my current operational mode, I can continue for approximately four more days. So you'll be able to return without any problems? Yes! Good. Let's go Understood. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1000,1300)}Hey! Please watch your step. There is a bump here. May I direct your attention here, Mr. Customer? The vanilla cream puffs sold at this store are so popular that the queue always extends well outside the door. Do you like cream puffs, Mr. Customer? Wouldn't know. Haven't exactly had one before. Anyway, I don't need you to be a tour guide, I need you to pick up the pace. I'm in a hurry. Yes, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1300,1600)}understood. Mr. Customer, located on the fifth floor of this building is a beer-hall affiliated with our department store. Its menu offers fresh seafood and many different kinds of craft beers. I'm begging you, cut the chatter and put that effort into walking faster. Yes, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1100,1400)}understood. Um, Mr. Customer... What, need another break? Yes. My femoral power unit has overheated and requires cooling. This rain really isn't letting up at all. Tell me about it. By the way, Mr. Customer, what is your line of work? I'm a Junker. Could you elaborate? In laymans' terms... I'm a garbage collector, I guess. Garbage collection? That is a very noble profession. My body is designed to be completely recyclable... About time we got going. You good to go? Yes, let us go on. Leave that here. By "that" do you mean this bouquet? Yeah. Holding onto that just makes it more likely for you to fall over. But this belongs to you. Look, it's...! Fine, I get it. The bouquet belongs to me. Hand it over. Of course. Here is your bouquet, Mr. Customer. My bouquet, huh? A liquor store... Mr. Customer, may I ask you something? Was this the result of a vehicle collision, gas explosion, or other accident? Could be from combat, or a scavenger like me. An accident of sorts, I guess. Finally found a liquor store and not a single damn thing's left. At least leave half of it standing... Wow! Is that...?! You'd be surprised at how little it takes to kill a man. No wires or a weight-sensitive plate. It could also be rigged up with... Here you are. After all that effort, this is all I get... It appears that bottle you have there is a scotch whiskey. A Twelve-year Sherry Barrel... Price including tax is... You know a lot of things. I'm impressed. Yes, thank you. Mr. Customer, {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1300,1600)}is everything all right? Mr. Customer. There is a bump here, so please watch your step... For the fourteenth time... I told you to watch where you're going. I understand. My apologies. I'm surprised you're not in pieces by now. I am more durable than my appearance may suggest. That's good to know.. Yes. The streets really are empty. Yeah, it's just us. On rainy days like these, we can't go outside, so it's very boring. However, spending time indoors could be fun too. Do you ever get bored? Bored? What do you mean? You've worked at the planetarium for a long time, right? Haven't you ever wanted to work a different job? I am very fond of my job. Working with Mr. Manager, the staff, and Miss Jena brings me much joy. I see. Mr. Customer, may I ask you something? Hm? What is it? Have you ever made a wish to God? Perhaps, but nothing important. Come to think of it, I never asked you what you would wish for. Yes, that is correct. What would you wish for? Please... Please do not divide heaven in two. That is my prayer to the God of Robots. If people and robots were to be separated at the Gates of Heaven, then I would be truly worried. Even if I go to Heaven, I still would like to be of service to all humans. I would like to be of assistance to everyone, now and forever. Is that so... Yes, it is! If I leave her like this, her batteries will run dry. If I'm to make her wish come true, I would have to take her out of this city... But can I force her to leave against her will? Mr. Customer, is your car still a long way away? No, we're nearly there. Excellent. Shall we continue? Yeah.. It must be because I had alcohol for the first time in ages. No... I had already been drunk well past my limit long before I encountered that bottle of whiskey. Mr. Customer? It's nothing. Let's go. What am I going to do with her? Mr. Customer, these streets are considerably different from how they show up on my database. Have the streets been redeveloped recently? It's just as you see. Is that a construction machine of sorts over there? It's a Fiddler Crab, autonomous fire-support Mech. Can you elaborate? Something not unlike yourself. But here, of all places? right in front of the quarantine wall? Can I make it? Mr. Customer? I'm going hunting. Hunting? Stay here until I come back. I'm leaving this city soon. What will you do after I leave you? I will be able to walk back to my workplace, so please do not worry. There's no one left in this city. Even if you were to return, you'll never again have any customers, and you'll never again be able to show the planetarium to anyone. Also, the reactor in this city is on its last legs. The projector will never operate again. You've seen all of this with your own two eyes! Yes, but according to my information and accumulated databases, I believe that customers will surely come again. As for the power outage, both Miss Jena and I are willing to wait as long as it takes for the power to come back online. Look! Listen very closely to what I'm about to say, and listen well. Yes, understood. You saw the state of this city on your way here, and I need you to make your choice based on that. This city no longer needs you or{\i10} the planetarium! If you want to continue working for humans, you have to come with me. I don't know if that will make you happy. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2700,3000)}But I... I believe that I wish to continue serving all humans as well. That is what makes me happy. However, I believe that I have insufficient data based on what you have told me to decisively select a course of action. You have no means of gaining any more data. Don't you understand? You have until I come back to think it over. Yes, understood. Oh, right. Hold on to this. Of course. I will handle it with care. Again, no matter what happens, don't move. Don't say a word until I come back. Understood. I have registered this as a critical directive I will eagerly await your return. A recharge station would be expensive, but not impossible to obtain. I could probably build her a small projector. We could carry that around, travel from colony to colony, and show people the starry sky together with her commentary. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2400,2700)}That could be our new line of work. I must be losing it. Sorry buddy, but I've got a partner again. It misfired?! My pre-emptive strike failed. That makes things difficult. I've got two grenades left. I need to get as close as possible, take out its legs. Then aim for the topside armor and knock it out of commission. Doesn't waste ammo, I see. Standard operating protocol when faced with an enemy of unknown firepower. Then resume suppressive fire... Knew it! One... two... three! Shit... my ears... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1400,1700)}Need to assess the situation! It takes thirty seconds to reload. Won't be long before it fires again! A fracture? An eye for an eye, a leg for a leg, is it? Why did you do such a stupid thing?! Welcome back, Mr. Customer. Are you hurt? I told you to stay put until I got back! The unregistered machine appeared to be in a rampant state. A force-stop signal was sent, but was ignored. The receiver may have been out of order, so an emergency physical shutdown was attempted, and failed. The rampant machine appears to have ceased functioning. Please step away from the rampant machine and report this incident to a nearby police station or support center. My sincerest apologies for violating a critical directive. However, there was an older promise I had to keep. I must not knowingly allow any human being to come to harm. Keeping this promise is the pride of us robots. Mr. Customer, are you injured? No, I'm fine. That is most relieving to hear. I apologize on his behalf. I believe he may have malfunctioned, too. We robots were created for the happiness of humans. I'm sure he never wanted to act with such violence. I know... Because I, too, am slightly malfunctional. The emergency batteries will deplete in approximately 600 seconds. Because the backup batteries are depleted, I will be unable to boot after this. I am sending a maintenance call, but it is not being acknowledged. I feel{\alpha&HFFH&} somewhat abandoned. I feel somewhat abandoned. You don't need to call anyone! I'll save you. But... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1400,1700)}I'll fix you. My sincerest apologies for my disorderly state. Please do not worry. Since I am a robot, I do not feel pain. I can be repaired, or transferred to a whole new body. There are no longer any engineers that can repair you... Any bodies to replace yours... Or any humans that need you... Not in this{\alpha&HFFH&} world... Not in this world... Please, if you maintain that facial expression, I will be most worried. I am a robot. My customers' smiles are most important to me. I remember every single one of them. As a robot, I am good at remembering things. I am Hoshino Yumemi. Thank you for this wonderful name. I will be sure to do my best. Thank you very much. Here you go, Yumemi! Yumemi, thank you for the pretty stars. I'll bring all of my friends next time, so stay well! Next time, I'll visit with my wife on our anniversary. The starry sky was as beautiful as it was when I was younger. I hope to visit you again next year. I learned a lot about the stars, and I had a lot of fun! For my summer science project, I'll write about you, Yumemi. Um, it was super pretty, and really moving! I'm so gonna come again! I love you, Yumemi! Thank you very much. We eagerly await your return. Yumemi, we um... need to go on a trip for a while. A trip? That sounds wonderful. Yumemi... Could you please wait for us here until we return? Yes, understood. When will you be returning? {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1400,1700)}That's... W-We're not really sure yet. But we'll be back for sure. When that happens, let's work together again, okay? Do you understand, Yumemi? Yes, Mr. Manager. I'm so sorry, Yumemi... To leave you out here, all alone... Please do not worry about me. I will be waiting here for you with Miss Jena for as long as you need. Please leave matters in my hands, and enjoy your trip. That was from 29 years and 71 days ago. 44 years and 138 days have passed since our first projection at the planetarium. Until you came, Mr. Customer, time after time I wondered... When would Mr. Manager and the other staff members return? When would our next customer arrive? I always found myself reaching the same conclusion— that the humans would never return again. But that was impossible. That is why I thought I must have been malfunctioning. I ran my self-diagnostic program to locate the error. However, no error could be found. Therefore, I concluded that there must be an unknown bug within the self-diagnostic program. When you arrived, Mr. Customer, I was overjoyed. It seemed I was wrong after all. The customers had not forgotten about me. That is what I thought, and it made me very happy. But again, I was wrong about that. There was nothing wrong with me. What's wrong was... Why is the world all wrong...? The emergency batteries will deplete in approximately 150 seconds. Because the backup batteries are depleted, I will be unable to boot after this. I can record one more message. Mr. Customer, to commemorate your visit to our planetarium, please record {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1800,2100)} a message with me. Listen closely. Yes, sir. To tell you the truth, I came to get you. Could you clarify? On the other side of that wall is a new workplace for you. Your projector partner, your coworkers, they're all waiting for you there. There's also a venue full of customers, all waiting for you too. Everyone's eagerly waiting for your commentary. That's your new workplace, starting today. You can work there for as long as you want. That's just like Heaven, is it not? Yeah... Yeah, it is I finally understood who you are, Mr. Customer. Mr. Customer, will you hear my wish? Sure, what is it? Behind my ear receiver is a memory card slot. All of my memories are stored there. Each and every one is precious to me. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,5100,6100)}Could I ask you to deliver it to my new workplace? If you can provide me with a new body, I can start working on that very day. I can continue working for people for as long as I am allowed. So, to tell you the truth, I do not need a heaven. However, if I must go to Heaven, please, God, do not divide {\alpha&HFFH&} Heaven in two. do not divide Heaven in two. Please do not divide{\alpha&HFFH&} robots and humans. Please do not divide robots{\alpha&HFFH&} and humans. Please do not divide robots and humans. I would very much like to work{\alpha&HFFH&} for humans... forever I would very much like to work for humans... forever and ever... I understand. I will do as you wish. Yes. Thank you... very much... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2600,2900)}I am overjoyed. Mr. Customer? Where did you{\alpha&HFFH&} go? Where did you go? Mr. Customer? Are you there? I wonder... It seems I am indeed malfunctioning slightly, after all. I am{\alpha&HFFH&} an Economy Edition model, I lack the capability to shed tears. I am an Economy Edition model,{\alpha&HFFH&} I lack the capability to shed tears. I am an Economy Edition model, I lack the capability to shed tears. However, if I did {\alpha&HFFH&} have that functionality, However, if I did have that functionality, I believe{\alpha&HFFH&} I would most likely be crying now.

I am filled with{\alpha&HFFH&} a joyous feeling. I am filled with a joyous feeling. So... why? I wonder what my new workplace {\alpha&HFFH&}will be like? I wonder what my new workplace will be like? I {\alpha&HFFH&}must be in top condition, I must be{\alpha&HFFH&} in top condition, I must be in top condition, so that I{\alpha&HFFH&} can welcome my guests whenever they arrive. so that I can welcome my guests{\alpha&HFFH&} whenever they arrive. so that I can welcome my guests whenever they arrive. Why don't you come{\alpha&HFFH&} to the planetarium? Why don't you come to the planetarium? The {\alpha&HFFH&}beautiful twinkling of eternity... The beautiful {\alpha&HFFH&}twinkling of eternity... The beautiful twinkling{\alpha&HFFH&} of eternity... The beautiful twinkling of{\alpha&HFFH&} eternity... The beautiful twinkling of eternity... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1300,1600)}I'd better get going... Treasure? This case... This case is your treasure? Actually... ...the treasure is inside this case. This is the symbol of the Stargazer. I want you to treasure it well. And... if you were to see the real stars one day... My apologies. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,2600,2900)}We want you to appear at our meeting. You should wait for us in another room. No! We'll stay here! Because we... The Stargazer has made us his disciples! I'm sorry. They didn't listen to anything at all. I understand... Now listen. This is our conclusion: You should leave our village today. What?! How could you?! He is still weak! Yob! Ruts! This is the final decision. Wait! We made a promise! He's going to teach us all about the stars, and we'll become Stargazers! We'll become Stargazers and go to other villages. North, south, we'll even go to the Moon! That cannot be allowed. Why?! The Stargazers' role is already over in this world. That is our decision. You are wrong! Ezula and others are wrong! You didn't even see the stars! You'll understand if you see the stars! How can you decide something so important without giving the stars a chance? How can...{\alpha&HFFH&} you... How can... you... Why... Why are you so sure you're right?! Why?!{\alpha&HFFH&} Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Lebi... Lebi, Yob, Ruts. That's enough. {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1300,1600)}Thank you. All of you have helped me a lot. You have my gratitude. Dear Goddess, please make the Stargazer stay in our village. We'll be good kids! Please! Lebi, Yob, Ruts. Elemiya told me that you are here. I want to bid you farewell. Are you leaving already?! Please stay for a bit longer! We still don't know much about the stars! And about the device! I'll give my books to you. If you want more, you should search books in other areas. Even in this world, you're still able to gather knowledge. You'll need a strong will to never give up. But?! Don't worry, you'll make it for sure. Can't you stay for a bit longer?! I'm sure that Goddess will hear our prayers. Even God can't grant all wishes. What's wrong?.. This...is..an android... Right! Behind the ear...{\alpha&HFFH&} the slot... Behind the ear... the slot... {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1400,1700)}Oh that... Mister! Mister! Mister! What's wrong?! Yob! Call the adults! Yes! Mister! {\fade(0,0,255,0,0,1200,1500)}Mister!.. He had a long and difficult journey. His lungs and nervous system are worn out. He must be in pain every time he moves and talks. Don't worry. Ezula said that he'll be okay and wake up tomorrow. He should rest now. You should also sleep now. Okay? I see...{\alpha&HFFH&} You have come for me. I see... You have come{\alpha&HFFH&} for me. I see... You have come for me. Tell me... that place... Is there only one of it? If they're split up... I don't want to go there. It's been a while Yes. It has been a while. You look good. Yes! I am a robot after all... Take it. This is your bouquet. It is. Thanks for keeping it for me. Finally I can give it to you... I see... You've finally learned how to cry. Yes! Mr. Customer I'm not a customer. That is right. I wanted to thank you for a long time. Thank you so much. I've also wanted to thank you. Stars... Stories about the stars... that you told for the people. Thank you so much.
