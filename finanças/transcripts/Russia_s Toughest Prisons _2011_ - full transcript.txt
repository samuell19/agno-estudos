Once hidden behind the Iron Curtain, Russia is opening one of its most guarded institutions to the world. For the first time ever, three prisons across Russia unlock their steel doors to an international film crew. ALARM THEY SHOUT IN RUSSIAN And in one of Russia's highest security prisons, a cannibal divulges the details of his crime. TRANSLATION: I cut off his head, arms, legs. All of a sudden, something kind of struck me and I thought I would try him. This is a look inside Russia's toughest prisons. Near the border with Kazakhstan, a prison known as Black Dolphin houses Russia's most brutal criminals. DOG BARKS Black Dolphin holds roughly 700 of Russia's most dangerous killers. DOG BARKS Combined, they have killed over 3,500 people. It's an average of five murders per inmate. Overseeing the lockdown of Chechnyan terrorists, cannibals and serial killers is Lieutenant Guard Denis Avsyuk. TRANSLATION: The main crime committed by the convicts here is murder. But we also have maniacs, paedophiles and terrorists. To call them people, it makes your tongue bend backwards, just to say it. I have never felt any sympathy for them. Nikolai Astankov is serving a life sentence for killing an entire family and burning their bodies in the forest. TRANSLATION: If you constantly think about how you are here, what is waiting for you, that you won't ever get free, that you are left here alone... ..you simply won't make it. It's six in the morning and for the next 16 hours, Astankov and his cell-mate will not be allowed to sit on their beds. TRANSLATION: You're constantly being filmed in your cell. So you're being watched around the clock. Also, there are light and motion detectors. Plus, every 15 minutes, a guard goes through the cells, so you must constantly be attentive. Astankov shares his four and a half square metre cell with Sergei Vinogradov - a Russian gangster charged with the murder of six people. TRANSLATION: I have a tendency towards being hostile. I can kill a man, but a woman, a child, I couldn't harm. For me, it is wrong. And for everyone who was below me, there was a strict rule. A woman or child, you can't harm because they can't fight back. Like all inmates, Astankov and Vinogradov live in a cell within a cell, and behind three sets of steel doors. The extreme isolation makes life inside Black Dolphin nearly unbearable. TRANSLATION: My life, what I was preparing for, it all came to nothing. Of course, psychologically, it's difficult to deal with. Astankov and Vinogradov have very limited contact with the other prisoners. All prison operations maintain the highest level of isolation. TRANSLATION: There is no dining hall for life-sentence prisoners. Their food is taken directly to their cells. After breakfast, it's time for their daily exercise. TRANSLATION: When you are being led out, there is a dog and a handler that follow you. DOG BARKS In front of them is a senior officer. You are always watched by three employees. You are never left alone. DOG BARKS Believed to be unique to Black Dolphin, inmates move about in a stress position to render them powerless, bent at the waist, head down and cuffed. When moving between buildings, they are blindfolded. TRANSLATION: Why the blindfolds? Well, so the inmate does not have an opportunity to learn our movements, our location in the building or on the territory. So that if something suddenly happens, he will have no time to think about a movement in a certain direction. That is why we use the blindfolds. The position allows maximum control over dangerous inmates and keeps them from gaining an understanding of the prison layout. There is no prison yard at Black Dolphin. For 90 minutes, Astankov and Vinogradov pace like caged lions... ..without even a glimpse of the sky. Meanwhile, guards search their cells for anything out of the ordinary. The guards look for contraband and any signs of attempted escape, like loose bars. Once guards conclude their search, they lead the cell-mates back to their impenetrable cell. TRANSLATION: Escaping is impossible. With these bars, all of the constant alarms, always being watched, it's simply not possible. No-one has ever escaped Black Dolphin... ..and only one inmate in the prison's history has won an appeal. TRANSLATION: Black Dolphin is a final destination. You can't go any further. Yes, technically, there is a way to leave this place. But only one way. The cemetery. Even in the company of Russia's most brutal killers, some prisoners top the list for the most dangerous and demented. Vladimir Nikolayev is a cannibal. DOG BARKS Vladimir Nikolayev is one of Black Dolphin's most notorious criminals - a killer with the blood of two men on his hands... ..and their taste in his mouth. TRANSLATION: I was coming home from a party a little drunk... ..and next to the door to my building, another guy, also drunk, asked me for a light. We started arguing and got into a fight. He hit me and I hit him, and it turned out he died. What was I to do? I dragged him to the bathroom, undressed him, and started cutting him apart. I cut off his head, arms, legs. All of a sudden, something kind of struck me and I thought I would try him. I cut off a piece of meat from his thigh and boiled it. I tried it, didn't like it. So I chopped it up and fried it in a frying pan. I gave some meat to one of my friends. He took it home, gave it to his wife. She made dumplings with it. She had some herself and fed it to her children. Nikolayev's friends unknowingly ate the body of evidence. Well, I said it was kangaroo. We don't have kangaroos around here. They didn't know what it was. Russian prison tattoos have a historical place in prison culture. For over 50 years, inmates have scrawled their criminal histories and beliefs across their bodies. Well, the pirate here with a knife is a symbol of the constant life in prison. Here on this shoulder is my most-loved lady. Well, those are from my first term. My first term, I was in for three years. They are bell towers - each one represents a year in prison. Inside Black Dolphin, tattooing is strictly prohibited. DOG BARKS Russia's real-life Hannibal Lecter will live out the rest of his days caged in Black Dolphin on a diet of mainly soup and bread. A fellow murderer his only company. Over 1,000 kilometres away, outside of Moscow, sits Russia's oldest and one of the most feared prisons - the infamous Vladimir Central. DOGS BARK AND GROWL FURIOUSLY Known for housing Stalin's son and political prisoners during the Cold War, today it's the first stop for brutal murderers. A stroll down the dark hallways of Vladimir Central should deter any criminal impulse, yet over the last 228 years, Vladimir Central has imprisoned an estimated one million inmates. DOGS BARK AND GROWL FURIOUSLY Vicious dogs, the size of bears, and guards armed with AK-47s uphold a regime more rigid than anything in the Western world. This is the first time ever international crews are permitted inside the prison. TRANSLATION: In an American prison, everything is more open, and I don't think this is the best solution. Inmates cross paths, they eat together, and they openly go into their cells. I think that, after all, in a Russian prison, this is an advantage because of more isolation of the convicts. They should not influence each other. This is one of a few prisons in Russia that accepts inmates who have committed particularly heinous crimes. Before entering the general population, guards search inmates for contraband. They check every shred of clothing by hand. TRANSLATION: The seams are checked because mainly things are hidden in the seams. SIM cards, telephones... Well, telephones are not usually hidden in clothes, but they are mostly hidden in, how do you say, body cavities? Today, the guard finds forbidden contraband. TRANSLATION: This metal coil is forbidden because if they try to hook it up themselves, they are not electricians and they could get electrocuted which may give unfavourable results. So this is not allowed. Now, several guards execute a more thorough search of the inmate's belongings. Guards search both the cell and the inmate's belongings. Luckily, they find nothing suspicious. DOG BARKS Vladimir Central guard dogs are among the world's scariest. DOGS BARK AND GROWL FURIOUSLY Weighing up to 90 kilograms and standing almost two metres tall, they are said to have the stopping power of a 45-calibre gun. This is an especially aggressive breed, known as the Caucasian Mountain Shepherd. Once used by the Russian military, now they scare inmates into submission. Arthur Gauchin is serving a 21-year sentence for killing his wife and his brother-in-law. TRANSLATION: The had a neighbouring room and they would drink there without any limits. My daughter couldn't get any sleep. She said, "Papa, Uncle Sasha isn't giving me any peace." I warned them once, warned them twice, then... Well, what? I stabbed him. Arthur is not alone. Russia has a murder rate five times higher than the United States. TRANSLATION: My name is Igor, my sentence is 18 years. I am in for the murder of two people. I have been here for only two months. TRANSLATION: My name is Yevgeny. My sentence is 22 years and six months. I am in for a particularly brutal murder. This is hard, believe me, maybe in ten years I will comprehend just how hard it is, but for now, I don't think about it. TRANSLATION: And if you constantly think about the fact that you have 22 years, you can go crazy. Arthur has been in and out of prison most of his life. Russian prison tattoos cover his entire body. TRANSLATION: My tattoos are from the '80s, when convicts started to move away from the traditional prison subculture and hierarchy and started to get into something different. After that, tattoos stopped representing your sentence or your status, but rather your understanding of the light side and the dark side. Among old-timers, classic Russian prison tattoos express identity. Stars on shoulders signify the inmate will bow to no-one. Church domes can represent the number of years or terms served and religious tattoos can have misleading meanings. For example, a Madonna and child can mean the inmate has been a thief since childhood. TRANSLATION: This says "cor ne edito". It's Latin. It means, don't rip your heart. I just don't have one any more. Both Vladimir Central and Black Dolphin are among the prisons in Russia with alleged reports of unfair treatment and inmate abuse. None of the inmates interviewed in the show had a single complaint of any unfair treatment or abuse. Over 3,000 kilometres to the far east, the frigid Siberian tundra hosts 149 prison camps. Among them is Prison Camp 17. This prison camp lies on the outskirts of the city of Krasnoyarsk along the Trans-Siberian Railway. DOGS BARK Prison Camp 17 holds 1,200 inmates. All are first-time offenders. Like 24-year-old Dmitri Komarov, a Moscow native who was caught transporting ecstasy pills. TRANSLATION: In a Russian village, someone can steal a sack of potatoes. He could get half a year in prison. I don't think that's fair. The sentence I got was four years in a high-security prison. But Dmitri's days inside the camp may be numbered. In just a few days he will plead his case for early release. After almost three years, this young inmate may finally be going home. Unlike the maximum security of Black Dolphin and Vladimir Central, in Prison Camp 17 there is more opportunity for human contact among inmates. But even though day-to-day life in the prison camp lacks the extreme isolation of max security... ..the remote location isolates these inmates from their families. Prison Camp 17 sits in the heart of Siberia. Dmitri has been here since he was 21 years old. TRANSLATION: When I got here, it was wild. When they took us through the prison yard, everyone was looking at us. This is my mum, this is at our summer home right here. We have a little piece of heaven there. Because it's a three-day journey to Siberia, Dmitri's family doesn't visit. He has not seen them in over three years. TRANSLATION: My dog, he's a beagle. His name is Boss. It's hard to live. I think about them all the time. Constantly, actually. Perhaps in place of the relationships disrupted by his sentence, Dmitri has formed a new one on the inside. TRANSLATION: My best friend is my roommate, George. We live together, work together, we're always together. George is serving a five-year sentence for drugs and has three more years to go. TRANSLATION: Fear means showing weakness and people with weakness in this system break down. There are many examples. Some commit suicide, some lose their mind. You must decide for yourself, what are you afraid of? Pain? No. I think you should be afraid of being alone. The only thing I am afraid of is to be alone. The two friends have dreams of vacations and ventures upon their release. But for now, they are prisoners. Dmitri, George and all inmates in this camp are first-time offenders, but crimes range across the board, from drug charges to rape. TRANSLATION: I don't like rapists. I just can't stand them. I don't put them down, I just don't socialise with them. I will never do anything nice or pleasant for them. I just ignore them. And some are even here for murder. TRANSLATION: There was an inmate here. Because his mum didn't give him money for a bottle of vodka... ..he beat her to death with a stool. It's 6.00 am. George and Dmitri are up for mandatory morning exercise. Temperatures linger at 45 degrees below zero. Anton Yefarkin, a senior prison official, is overseeing the inmates. TRANSLATION: The entire correctional facility comes out and according to the schedule, does physical exercise. The exercises are specially selected to be light so the convicts can simply wake up and feel normal throughout the day. But today is unlike every other day. Two years into his five-year sentence, George prepares for a visit from his father. George is among the lucky inmates whose family visits him a few times a year. Most are not as fortunate. After a short hour, it's time to say goodbye for another several months. TRANSLATION: Well, of course I would like to see him more often. Excuse me... What can I feel? As a father, when I want to see my son and under these conditions, I can't. It hurts. In three years, George and his father will reunite on the outside. It will be a fresh start for their family, but it's a future that is still uncertain. TRANSLATION: God forbid if I end up here again. I wouldn't be able to even look my parents in the face. Later in the day, a potential security breach unravels. ALARM BLARES ALARM CONTINUES HIGH-PITCHED ALARM DOG BARKS Something triggers a motion detector in a secure area. DOG BARKS Fortunately, today's alarm is not a serious breach. TRANSLATION: In this case, we had a false alarm. Upon investigation, it turned out that the alarm responded to a gust of wind. The reserve team inspected the area and didn't see any signs of an attempt to escape. One of the guards reported to the guard in charge and the emergency was called off. Siberia battles a lack of cheap labour. The region's abundant prison camps have eased the problem. Prisoners see work as an opportunity to escape the monotony of incarceration. Inmates in Camp 17 sew uniforms and make industrial fencing for $5 a day. Siberia makes up more than three-quarters of Russia... ..but only 15% of Russians live here. Most have settled along the Trans-Siberian Railway. TRAIN HORN BLARES These trains have brought convicts to prison camps for over 100 years. DOGS BARK They are far from family... ..and unaccustomed to some of the harshest winters in the world. Today, a shipment of new inmates arrives. Among them, a convicted murderer. For new inmates, the first weeks of incarceration are intense. Most commonly, inmates experience fear, depression and aggression. He will spend the next two weeks quarantined, away from the general population. TRANSLATION: I can't describe it. Everything happened in a haze. I will try to survive. People can survive everywhere. Dmitri Komarov has a brighter outlook. Today is his parole hearing. TRANSLATION: I'm very nervous. I waited for this moment for two years and eight months. My feelings are indescribable. I don't know yet. When I go there, that's when I will have more definite feelings. Dmitri has one year and four months remaining on his sentence... ..but he is hoping for an early release. The questions focus on Dmitri's plans. Where will he stay? What will he do? And whether he will get back into crime. TRANSLATION: If they happen to say no to releasing me early on parole, then of course I'll be upset, but I will accept it. No-one will know the decision for sure right away, whether you get out early or must serve the full term. It's what the court decides. In another cell block, inmates who don't follow the rules face harsher treatment. TRANSLATION: This is a regimented place where converts who have violated the regime are held. Here, inmates stay in cells all day. Unless it's night-time, the beds are locked up. Anton, a senior guard, checks in. TRANSLATION: We are in the punishment cell area. Convicts are here for breaking the rules of the regime. All the inmates in this area are monitored 24/7. Some are reading books, someone is just walking around the cell so nobody is sleeping, nobody is breaking the rules. Behind this door is a convict who's spent time in a correctional facility in America. This bank robber served time in a Seattle jail, but he speaks only a little English. A few days after Dmitri's parole hearing, the administration has a response. Without the administration's support, he will spend the next year and a half in Prison Camp 17. TRANSLATION: I really want to meet with my father in the kitchen somewhere. Talk to him and just have a heart to heart. I really want to see my mother. She always really supported me. I miss their jokes, their love. I really miss this. I miss it every day. TRANSLATION: I'm extremely happy. My thoughts are already of being home. All my thoughts are of home. TRANSLATION: I am also extremely happy for Dmitri. I think that he deserved it. We are all here temporarily. Soon my turn will come. I think that, in freedom, we will definitely meet and keep our friendship when we are both free people.
