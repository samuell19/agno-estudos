(hip hop music) - Okay, is, what Andy? This is MJ Clayton. The car is not an MJ it is an MG. Super rare. I do not want to be driving a 50th anniversary MG in cartreuse with a large foot-shaped dent in the door. I don't know that it was someone's foot, it could've been... Can I, can I, can I speak to someone who's a good listener? (typing sound) - Do you like it? - Is it yours? - Yes it is. You're MJ Clayton, aren't you, from The Sky Beacon! - That's right, that's right, good good. - Yeah, I have heard about you. Hey, Chicago. Well? - Well what? - Look, I... Man, I really really appreciate you taking the time to look at my work. I just, I moved here from St. Louis. - That's great. - Yeah, this show... Means a lot to me. I've put my whole life into this. - Wow. - Yeah, I was invited to be here. - By? - Mrs. Tonington. I mean it was a (chuckles) big honor. - The Tonington Gallery has stooped to a new dismal low. Another tiresome display with dispassionate, futile canvas, and all the trite and misdirected "artists" as they call themselves realize perhaps that their efforts might be better spent painting mailboxes. (clears throat) What? - Here's your espresso. - No no, not on the desk! - Where would you like me to put it, Mr. Clayton? - What did you just say? - Where would you like me to put this? - Who are you? - I'm a temp, Miss Wyman's taking some time off. - Oh. You're a lot easier on the eyes. So what are you, a student? - I'm an art student at Whittingdale. - How about that. I never met one of those before. - I'm sorry, but you ordered this, right? - Just take that off and put that right there. Could you, I'm sorry, could you... - Oh, sure. Here you go, sir. Let me know if you need anything else. - What? - If you need anything? - Oh, okay. - let me know. - Thank you very much. Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Clayton! - Jim! Hi. - We've been getting another batch of complaints about your reviews. - Well good, that means people are reading your paper. - People always read the paper... - Tell you what, tell you what, tell you what. I'm gonna go on vacation. After I get back from vacation, I will give it some thought and in the meantime, I have got to get to another artist opening. Please, can I just? - Remember what I said. - I will, I've got it right in here. (elevator music) - How's it going, MJ? - Yeah, fine. Gotta get the hell out of here. - You're not quitting on us are you? - No, I'm going on vacation. - Well we're sure gonna miss you. Who's gonna write your column? - (mumbles). - Heading up North? - That's enough. - I call it Hummingbird. - How, how did we get to Hummingbird? - The dynamics between the shadows and the highlights, like right here, speak of summer and freedom. Hummingbird just made sense. - I see. Well thank you for sharing that. - You know, I don't do this for the money. - Really? - No, I do it because... - Let me guess, let me, may I? - Yeah. - You do this because you have an inner spirit that speaks to you and drives you to create. And your parents paid for you to go to art school someplace and then the world discovered your unbelievable gift. - Go on. - I think it's clear that you obviously operate off a trust fund of some sort and I don't think that your wife likes sex, so you just kind of create things like this, and you don't have kids so you probably have a pet of some kind. - Wow. - You don't know who I am, do you? - No. And I don't think I really want to. - Not from around here? - Now that part you got right. As for the rest, my girlfriend is very healthy, if you know what I mean. My last sculpture sold for 7,500 bucks. I don't have any pets, but I do have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. - Super. - So what, you like to visit the galleries and kick the artists for fun? - No, I get paid for it. Anyway, see ya. - So what'd he say? - Should I know this guy? He acted like I should. - Maybe. You know, he's the critic for The Sky Beacon. - Oh shit. - What happened? - Well I might have been a little bit rude. - Good! The little bastard had it coming. The rest of us are too chicken to ever say anything. We always try to avoid him. - So I take it he was here covering the show? - Yup, sure was. - I am so screwed. Hey, I'm Frank. - Brian. It's good to meet you. Haven't seen you around here before. - No, I'm just visiting, I'm from Michigan. Muskegon actually. - Well I hope you sell something. - Thanks, me too. So when does his review come out? - Saturday's paper usually. - Tomorrow. - Yup. - Wow. Well I hope I have some sales before everyone finds out what lousy stuff this is. (laughing) Good meeting you. - You too. - To fully describe the state of affairs at the Bremeiter Gallery, one must first erase any expectation of skill or emotional acuity. At the bottom of this quagmire like dead Guppies lay clunky inert works by newcomer Frank Denham. (mutters) clunky.

(remixed banjo music) - Hey, hey! Sit down and stop it! (loud clang) (horse clomping) (country jazz music) - Hi, can I please have a... - I'll be right back. - Hi, can I have a gin and tonic please? - Coming right up. - And a glass of water? - Sure. Here you go. - Great, I'm sorry, I forgot to ask, I need a lime. - Give me a minute. Here you go. - Okay. Oh, I need a lime. - Shit, I forgot. You ready to order? - I really need the lime. - I'll be right back. - And like bam, right in the shoulder. Spun me around, and then I ended up in the grass, I don't even know how I ended up in the grass, but the bike was over there. - Here you go, sir. - Are you kidding? You kidding me? That's a lemon. - That's all that's back there. - In a bar? - That's all I could find. You ready to order? - Why do they have to print this thing so small, I mean can you... - I can read it. - All right, fine, do you have white fish? - We do. - Okay. - And it's excellent. - Thank you, I'll just... - We're sold out. Some other guy got the last one. - I gotta pee like nobody's business. I'm gonna see you guys in a minute. - What other fish do you have? - Fish and chips. - I don't, no, what fish do you have? That's not fish, that's some snack food. - Hey Jean! Listen, Kevin and Greg have had way too much, so you're gonna have to cut them off, all right? - Okay. - Sorry, fish and chips? - Fine. (no audio) - Here. - Just give me the bill. - Now? - Just give me the bill. - Aren't you gonna eat? - Just, can I please have the bill? - You're not gonna eat it? - May I have the bill? - No dessert? - Would you give me the bill please? - No coffee? - Give me the, give me the damn bill. What does that say? - $19.34. - Keep the change. (crowd laughing) - Hey, aren't you that little prick from Chicago who wrote the review about my stuff? - No, I'm sorry. - No, wait wait wait! - Hey hey hey hey! - From the gallery! You're the critic guy. - You got the wrong guy, now just calm down. - No, not so fast, buddy. - You know what? Fine, I'm the critic. What do you want? - That show was supposed to run for two weeks. It got pulled after two days because of you. - Get over it and good night. Ahh, there's a large animal right there. You know what? You just about killed me, why don't you watch where you're going? - Nice work, Mikey! - Sorry Mister, but you ran into us. - Yeah, he's got a point you know. Hey, I'm still a little bit thirsty, what do you say you and me go get a drink, huh? - How about not? How about I just walk you right over there. - What, no no, hey, - Put you on the curb... - No, I just... - Park you like a bike. - I just saved your life you know, the least you can do is buy me a little drink. - You didn't save my life, and I'm, all right, you know what? One drlnk. - All right, fine. - One drink, stop hitting me. - I'm sorry. - Where do you wanna go? - Let's go right over, no, the horse is there. - There's the large horse. - This way! Follow me! (horse neighs) To art! To whoever the hell he is. (laughing) - Okay, that was a really old joke, and this is not Plymouth Gin. - Listen, listen, listen. How about you stop with the criticism starting now. - And she forgot the lime, what is... - (stammers). So tell me, what makes you so damn qualified anyway, huh? - Well I'll tell you what, it's like the old saying goes, I don't know much about art, but I know what I loathe. Luckily for me, guys like you give me plenty of material. - Howdy ho, Frank. - What do you mean guys like me? - Come on, are you shitting me, that boob sculpture with the motor uterus, did you see that... - (laughs) Way to go, Marshall, you rock man! Marshall, I would like to introduce you to MJ Clayton. This is that dickweed art critic from Chicago who shut my show down. - No kidding. Can I buy you a drink or something? - I would save your pennies for an attorney. - Whoa, looks like we had a little excitement here. - Please call the police. - Yeah, I'm probably not gonna do that. - Hey, did your divorce go through yet? - That's none of your damn business. (mumbles). - Excuse me, I have been entrapped in a booth and punched, I've asked you to call the police, if you do not call the police you are an accessory... Dasha. - Another round? - Damn right. - Another round! - All right, I need to get out of here, excuse me. Excuse me. - This is good beer. (laughing) - No, no, that's... (laughing) The other thing, art, art is for the simple pleasure of viewing it. Not for analyzing it. That, stop it, that is where it's all gone screwy, and you're to blame. - Okay fellas, last round. - Oh thank God for you. - Can I have your name? Can I have your little nametag? - No! Hey you, limes! - Oh, you got your limes finally. Oh, just... - You spilled it. - Perfect. (laughing) - I'll tell you what else is to blame, you suck. (laughing) That's the whole reason that art has gone screwy. No, you suck. You're awful nice though. - Aw, thanks. (laughing) You know what though? Now if you think it's so easy, why don't you come up with something and then we'll be the critics. - Hey, there's an art festival coming up right here on the island. - Oh perfect! - Oh I don't think so. - Come on, you big wussy! - You know what an art festival on an island's gonna be? It's gonna be two city blocks full of bad Van Goghs, like an inch thick of paint. No. - That is some kind of an opinion right there. - That's right, you know what, and he said that he wasn't gonna be critical anymore tonight. - Maybe I should just punch you again. - Oh that would really scare me. (laughs) - Oh, (mumbles) now listen, wait a minute. The art show's on Friday, right? That means that gives you a week to come up with something. - What was the topic? - The art, you were gonna paint something! - Okay, let me just tell you one thing. I could take a brush and clench it in the muscles of my ass cheeks and do a finer painting than any of the tit based sculptures that you have ever done in your life. - All right, you know what? 500 bucks says you can't do it. - You're on. - This oughta be good. (laughing) - I can see it now. Famous Jackass Critic Loses 500 Bucks Drawing Stick Figure. (laughing) (loud hammering) - Excuse me, excuse me! (groans) - Morning, neighbor! - Hi, what are you, ow! What are you, what are you doing? - I'm finally getting around to those old birdhouse. - It's... It's dawn. - Actually it's almost 10:30. This old place has been in my family for over 85 years. Kinda nice, isn't it? - Could you, ow! Could you please please please stop hammering. - Well sure I guess. You're the new owner? - I inherited it. - Good for you. Takes a lot of work to keep these old cottages up you know. (vomits) Are you gonna be all right? - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Should I call a doctor? - No. (vomits) (classic blues music) (knocking) (remixed acoustic guitar music) Ahh, gah! This, do you have a cart that doesn't have those little spinning things? - For right now that's the only cart I have. - Just come with me and carry my stuff, would you please, this is ridiculous and I have (mumbles). - 24.60 please. - How are you? - Pretty good, how are you doing today? - I want some coffee. How old is the coffee? No, I know where the coffee is. - It was made this... - It was made this morning, at the crack of dawn? Is this an antique shop or groceries? Someone needs to put on a fresh pot of coffee. - Okay, yup. - It sits there, the oils and the sediment, that's very unhealthy, it's acrid. - Sure. - Anyway, I was saying you guys really spruced this place up. It's nice. - Yeah, we did some good remodeling this year. It was done pretty quickly too. This is excellent. We get this from the mainland, it came in this morning. - I know it, I love that stuff. - This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. That could just spill on anybody, it could spill on her right over there. - I'll take that. - No, don't touch it, it's gonna get all over the place and I need that, I need some aspirin, where's your aspirin? - Just down the aisle on your right. - I'm allergic to most aspirin. - What do we got here? - This tuna's excellent. - Healthy. - It's in water, not oil. - Healthy. - How much is this?! - I like it with chopped pickles. Here you go, 23.10 is your total today. - Ooh, I got 20 is all I got, 20. - That's okay. Just bring the other three bucks when you're around. - Super, thanks a lot, appreciate it. - You're welcome. - Nice to see you. - Good to see you too. Do you want your receipt, sir? - Morning, Clayton! - Hey Frank. - Boy, you sure can hold your booze, can't you? - Well I can, as it turns out, but I have a series of other issues today which make me feel under the weather, so I think I'm just going to go home and then I'll see you later. - Your house is that way. - I knew that, but what was hoping to do was pick up some fudge because even sick, I just feel like fudge sometimes. - Yeah. Hey, did you get the box of art supplies I left? - I did. I don't know what that relates to, but whatever it is, it doesn't mean anything to me. - Oh now wait a minute now, we had an agreement. You made it pretty clear last night that you could create better art than me. - I said that? - Yeah, yeah, pretty cocky huh? - That is pretty cocky, but I think that we can safely say that that was the liquor talking. - Well it may have been the liquor, but it was your words. - Okay, but the thing is I feel that whatever it was I said, that if I did say that I'm sorry, I didn't say it. - Well I would love to let you get away with that, but I can't. - And that is because... - Because the final entries were submitted this morning and yours was one of them. Oh by the way, you owe me 50 bucks for that. I gave you acrylics in the box, I hope you like acrylics. I think it's really romantic medium. They are thrilled that you're gonna be a part of this, by the way. - I hate acrylics. Here's the thing, I'm on vacation and I really can't... Be in your little competition. - Well it's a little late for that 'cause you are a part of the Little Island Art Competition. Oh, by the way, I think they're gonna make you some kind of a dignitary or something. Good luck. (acoustic guitar pop music) - Something I can help you with? - We met last night at the bar. Marshall! - You hit me. - Yeah, I wanted to apologize about that. Are you okay? - Why don't you get the hell out of my house?! - I was hoping you could help me. - With what?! - You know Frank's a friend of mine, and he sorta thinks that I'm part of the whole art community like he is. I had a highway striping business, I spent a little too much time drinking and lost it. - Uh huh. - I never really told him the only paint I used was yellow. - That's very funny. - Now that has to stay our little secret. - We're not having and secrets large or small. What do you want? - I need somebody to help me and you're the perfect guy! - Spit it out, I got a headache. - I signed up for the art festival. - And? - I don't know, it's something I always really wanted to do. - Well do it and get out, I don't want you here, I want to take a nap! - Frank tells me that you signed up too. - I did not sign up, he signed me up, it doesn't count, I have nothing to do with that festival. - Your name's on the list. - What list? - The list. It's even on the website. - You are shitting me. - No, I just saw it! - Well I don't care, it doesn't count, I am not part of that festival. - But can you help me? - No. - Oh come on. I just need somebody with a fresh set of eyes to take a look at my work and help me a little bit. Here. - What is that? - Can't you see? It's the flower emerging from the ashes. - It looks like a bunch of bananas emerging from the ashes. - That's why I need the help. - Well I am not an art teacher. - Could you at least think about it? Look, I'll come back tomorrow and I'll leave this right here just in case you get a minute. - Why don't you just... - Yes, you're right, don't wanna be a pest. I'll stop by tomorrow, maybe you'll be feeling better by then. Thanks a ton. - Yeah, take that a put it on the porch. It might be better with dew on it. (knocking) (louder knocking) Excuse me! Hi, were you knocking just now? - No, I don't wanna bother you, but... - No, it's fine, I was just distracted. - Are you MJ Clayton? - Yes I am. - I was hoping I could have a word with you. - Of course! Come on in. - I'm Lisa. - Hi, Lisa. Would you like to have a thing of drink? - No thanks, I'm not gonna take up too much of your time. - Have a seat. - All right. I heard you were on the island. I figured, I assumed it had something to do with the festival, our festival. - Oh, that's funny because actually I'm here vacationing and the whole art festival is kind of a coincidence. - Oh. Well I was wondering if... If maybe you could help me with some of my painting, I entered the art contest and I really just think if I just had a little bit of advice then I would do better. I'm sorry, this is insane. You have better things to do, I"m sorry... - Oh no no, oh no no no no no, let me be the judge of that. I really would like your things, your paintings. - Really? You're not just saying that? - No! One of the greatest joys in my life is in just nurturing young talent. - That's great, I just, I left my painting out by the fence. (laughing) I know, but I'm gonna get them. - All right. - If you're sure. - Oh no, I'm not so sure. - You're totally sure? - Okay, I'll be very (mumbles). - Okay, great, thank you. Are you sure this is okay? - Absolutely. Can't wait to see. - Thank you so much. - Sure. - (mumbles) what I wanna show you. That, that one. Well? - You have talent. What else you got? - That's just... This one. It's of my grandmother. - This is unbelievable. - I... I'm pretty happy with it I think. - This is incredible, you did this?! - Yes, I did, it took a long time. - It should take a long time, this is, this, I'm speechless! - I just know that I'm gonna be up against some really good stuff and I just, any... I'm open to suggestions. Anything that you wanna... - Okay. This... This shading right there? Maybe that's a little bit strong, just a little bit because sometimes the beauty of shadows is that you can, if there's a little bit of detail, you can see into it almost like you can feel the darkness. Similarly, the skin tones, maybe they're a little bit, just in there, a little bit robust 'cause she's frail and you might wanna portray that in the skin tones. I haven't seen anything else that's gonna be entered in the festival, but this is fantastic. - You know, my grandmother, she passed away a few months ago, so this painting is really... Sorry. (sobbing) - It's okay. Shh... - I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Thank you so much though, I'm gonna make those changes. - Well now don't do anything rash. - No, I'm gonna do those things that you said. - Don't just fix them because I said to fix them because I was trying to... - I think it's a really good idea, I think. - You're welcome here any time. - Thank you, that means a lot to me. - You know what? You wanna grab a quick dinner sometime? - I'll find you. - Wow. (phone buzzes) Okay, okay, okay, okay. Hello? Oh come on, we've been over this a thousand times. Look, look, look, I treat them all the same, it is not my fault that they're all terrible. They should know the truth. Oh is that so? Are you kidding me, he is in editorial! Really? (knocking) All right all right, don't do anything hasty, just... Give me a couple days to sort things out, I'll call you, okay? Okay, yeah, bye. - Is everything okay? - Oh yeah, it's great. - I just wanted to let you know that my schedule freed up for dinner if the offer is still good. - Well yeah. Great, where do you wanna go? - The Crestridge is good with me. - Crestridge is great. - Okay. - Meet you there around seven? - Seven it is. Okay. (laughs) Bye. - Bye. Damn. (oddball banjo pop music) (knocking) (louder knocking) - Can I help you? - I'm sorry, is this a bad time? - No, not particularly. - Is that for the art show? - I don't know, maybe. - I'm Mary Beth. I'm in charge of the festival this weekend. I just heard you were on the island and I simply had to come by and introduce myself. - Well it's a pleasure to meet you. - I saw your name on the list of participants. - Yeah, that's a mistake. Somebody's playing a dirty joke on me. - No, don't be modest. People are excited that an artist of your caliber is taking the time to participate in our festival. - Really? - Yeah, people come from all over the Midwest to be a part of it. We even had someone from New York show up last year. It's really fun. - Want a drink? - That would be lovely. - Hey, is beer okay, I think it's all I got. - That would be perfect. Are these yours? - Yeah. I think I'm going through a white period right now. - Aren't you gonna have a beer with me? - I'd love to, but I can't. Kinda overdid it last night. - So how long you gonna be here? - I don't know. Maybe a week or two. Waiting for a call from the office. - You know, I've always wanted to meet you. - Get outta town. - I was in Chicago last year and I saw you around town sometimes. - Really? = Yeah, the whole art thing just turns me on. - Mmmm. - Well I think all creativity comes from the heart. Don't you? - Yeah. I do. (snuffling) (clanging) - Hey there. - Hey hey hey. - I thought you might be hungry. I made us some eggs for dinner, I hope you don't mind. - No, not at all. - Here you go. So Beth Anne, tell me... - Mary Beth. - I'm so sorry. Okay, Mary Beth, tell me, where are you from? - Minneapolis. Then LA, Kansas City, followed a friend here. - I love it here, I think it's great. So simple and little horse drawn carriages is great. - Yeah, I like it too. (knocking) - Just ignore it, they've been bugging me all day. (louder knocking) Oh shit! Excuse me, one second. Hi. You know what happened? This is what happened, I fell asleep and just now I woke up and that's why I messed up because I was more tired than I thought and I don't know what to say except could I have a rain check? - It's okay, I probably should've given you a little bit more time to get settled, so it's my fault probably. - Well the last two weeks have been tough. - Mary Beth? - She just walked in the back door and I think it's a country thing, but here's the thing, I think she'll be gone soon and then I'm just gonna (mumbles). - Yeah, all right. - I think it had something to do with the art festival. - I'm gonna talk to you later, Mr. Clayton. - Please don't take it that way, don't take it like that, come here, come here. I wanna make it up to you. I wanna talk to you about your painting. - My painting? - Yeah. So how about this, is there any way we could meet for breakfast and I promise I won't be late? - All right, well I go running at seven, so how about 8:30? - Great, 8:30 it is, I will be there. Now just tell me where. - Friends of my parents have a hotel, we can meet there. - Great, what hotel is it? - The Grand. - The Grand Hotel? - The Grand, meet me on the porch. - Okay, I will be there. - Don't be late. - I'll be there. Night. - I've seen her around. Who is she? - A friend. - You're getting to be a pretty popular person up here. (electric guitar blues music) - Hello. - Hey. - You made it. - Yeah. - So? - Wow. - It's nice, isn't it? - I'm so happy to see you, I guess I thought you would teach me a lesson. - Oh no, I'm not like that. - This place is beautiful. - I know, yes, it is so beautiful. I spent a lot of summers here growing up. - Lucky girl. - So I got us a table inside if you wanna come on. - Man. (horse clomping) - Over here. (laughing) - Ah, let me. - Thank you. - First of all, I want to apologize for standing you up last night. - Hey, you... You're a busy man. - There's one thing I'd love to... - Good morning, Lisa. - Johnny, hi, how are you. This is Mr. Clayton. Mr. Clayton, Johnny. - How do you do? - Can I start you off with some fresh squeeze orange juice? - That would be perfect, and I'd actually, just order now if we can? - Sure. - Two eggs scrambled with green peppers and onions mixed in and a couple slices of bacon, rye toast, hold the butter, and a cut of fruit. - I'll just have black coffee. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I will have you know. - That's what I've been told. Have you been working on your painting? - Some, some. - Well I have been unable to think about anything besides that painting. I would like to buy it. - Buy it? It's not for sale. - Oh. Well here's the thing. This is kind of awkward. Somebody entered me in the art festival as a joke, mean joke, and I didn't know to bring any of my own work. I'm not gonna be able to come up with anything from scratch by this weekend, and I'm afraid that if I withdraw, it's gonna look like I'm disrespecting the other... - Right, so you want to enter my painting as yours. - Pretty much. Has anyone else seen it yet? - Not really, but it doesn't seem right. I've been working on that painting all summer. - Well the painting that keeps the... - Thank you. - It doesn't diminish the painting at all. - You know what, I'm really surprised that you would ask me to do that. - Why? - It's unethical in every way. - Okay, I was just thinking in terms of... - What? - I need your help as a friend. I don't have anything for the festival and if you could just help me. I mean that painting looks like the kind of thing that I could've done. - I beg your pardon? - Oh God, that is not what I wanted, that did not come out right. - Wow. - No no no no no, okay look, look at me. Look at me, please, I'm begging you. It's so incredible that it looks like... All right, forget everything, forget about the painting for a second. Knife me. Please, and then I am going to do some damage to myself if you don't promise me that you will erase that whole conversation. Just please, it's, it's all wrong. I did not say any of that. Good morning. - We can drop this. - I'm not even gonna have breakfast because I got my foot so far down my throat. - We're gonna drop this completely. - Is that okay? - Yes, that's, that will be great. - You should wear yellow, it's an unbelievable color for you. - Thank you.

So how's the vacation going? Marshall. Road stripe guy. Friend of Frank's. The guy that punched you. - No, can't place ya. ♫ Then show me who's a man ♫ Baby it's all right to search my mind ♫ To find the man I'm holding on tonight ♫ Don't you hide, don't be shy ♫ Let that energy rise ♫ Let that energy rise ♫ Me and you - I don't wanna be a pest or anything, but have you given any thought to helping me with my painting? - Oh I sure have. - That's great! Well? - I'm not gonna help you. - Come on! This is important! - You don't deserve any help, you're a road stripe painter. If I'm gonna help anyone it'll be a real artist, not somebody who wants to get into a clique. - Hey guys. What's going on? - Nothing, would you like to get a beer or something? - That would be great. ♫ I ain't calling again ♫ I ain't calling again ♫ No I ain't calling again ♫ Oh no I ain't calling again ♫ I ain't calling again ♫ (applause) - Come in. Hey, what's up? - How's it going? - It's good, I'm trying to stay inspired. - Yeah? You got anything new for the show? I saw you were signed up. - Yeah, I have a couple of things I've been thinking about entering. - Can I see them? - No. They're not done yet. - All right, fair enough. - How about you? - Oh yeah, I got a pastel. So have you run into Clayton yet? - Actually I have. - That son of a bitch wrote a review about my show in Chicago and it closed down. - That's terrible. Wow. - Actually that's why I'm here. I figured I'd get some air. - You know Clayton has a cottage here. - I know that now, yeah. Of all the places to run into him. - So you've seen him. - Oh yeah. - You know he entered the festival? - I know, I signed him up. Figured it was payback time. That piece of shit is no artist. - I was wondering why he would enter. How'd that happen? - Well... I ran into him the other night and we started drinking. I called him a no good parasite bastard, something to that effect. Then he puffed up his feathers and challenged me and said that he could make better art than me. I mean even drunk, I knew that this would be a fun thing to watch. - Wow. I don't know, he seems nice. I mean kinda. - I have no use for him. - He gave me some pointers. - You let him see your work? - Yeah. He's the real deal. Is that a problem? - I guess there are probably some good critics out there, but the rotten ones outnumber them and this guy is worse than rotten, I'd just, I'd stay away from him. - I think we all should stick together for this festival. - Well that's what I say too, but not with that guy. - Hey, some folks stopped by to see you! I told them you were around somewhere! I think he said you work for them! - Was his name Wilkinson? - That sounds about right. Seems like this art show has drawn some pretty important people. (phone buzzes) - Hello? (laughs) Hi, I heard you stopped by. What are you doing on the island? You really came all the way up for that? (laughs) Very funny. Oh of course I've got something. It's even easier than I remembered, it's like riding a bike. No, not now, dinner maybe? Fine, I'll meet you there. (knocking) - Who is it?! - Me, Clayton. - Come in! Thank you. Wow, that was nice. - What is going on over here? - Hey, no no no no no, no no no no no no! - What? - That's my stuff. I actually was, I did some of the suggestions that you had, so it looks good. - Well don't change it too much 'cause if you ever do decide to sell it... - It's not for sale. - Okay. - All right. - Sorry. Wanna get a beer? - No, thanks, I'm actually gonna keep working. - You okay? - Yeah. - You sure? - What are you doing? - I'm just trying to, you know, just saying, you seem a little tense. - Please leave. - You sure you want me to go? - Yes I do, you need to get out of here! - Shit. Criminy, you send a lot of mixed messages. - No, go! - I'll give you $1,000 for it. - Goodbye, Mr. Clayton. - 2,000. - No, 10, 10, 10 and it's yours. - 4,000. - No, 10 today in cash or I will change my mind. - Let me see it. - No. - It's quarter to five, the bank's gonna close... - You better hurry. - That's what I get for being friendly. - You need to go. (oddball banjo and synthesizer music) - Hi there! - Hi. - Hi. How about coming over to my place for some dinner tonight? - I can't do it tonight, I can't do it today, sorry. - You can name the time. - I forgot to give you the rules to the art show. I gotta you the... - Fine, fine, guys, guys, I gotta be somewhere in five minutes, I cannot be late! Excuse me. Hi, I need to get some money out please. Make this real quick. - Do you have your account number? - No I don't. I'll tell you what, let's just get an advance on that. - I'm sure I can help. - Can you just toss that for me? - Of course. MJ Clayton? - Yeah. - How much do you need? - $10,000. - I'm going to have to make a call. - Knock yourself out, Wendy. - Do you have your pin number? - No. - Can I see some ID? - Hey, you're that art guy. - Now how in the world would you know that? - That just arrived this morning. You must be pretty into it to have your picture on the poster. Mr. Clayton? This is pretty unusual to withdraw this kind of cash. - I know, and that's your business cause... - 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800... - You know what, that thing I gave you, I'm sorry, I need that back, that's the rules. - Of course. - Thank you. - 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000... - And look how perfect, see, nine more. All right, thank you very much. - Hey, good luck with the contest! - Thank you! (country rock music) - So you're a pretty big fish up here. I saw your face on the poster for the art festival. - Oh that's, I had nothing to do with that, these people, they're so pushy. - So you really do have something ready. - Well I'm ready. - Can't wait to see it. - Can I get you anything? - Yeah, I'm good with water. And a gin. - Water. You know I just didn't come up here to check out this arts festival. - No? - Look, for the past couple of years your reviews have been getting way too harsh. I warned you a hundred times about this. Especially that last batch, I couldn't even run them. - Look, Jim, I've worked for you 12 years, people love the column, and I need my job, I need the money. - I could have just sent you a note, but I wanted to tell you in person. You'll be fine. - I'll be okay? I'm up to my eyebrows in payments on stuff. I'll lighten up on the reviews. - It's too late. I was told by the board to let you go. But hey, it sounds like this painting makes you happy. Maybe you should stick with that. This could be the beginning of a new career. - Wait a second, did you say that that last batch of reviews didn't even run? - Not a one. - The ones on Frank Denham's sculptures? - Never saw daylight. I hired this writer who's been bugging me. He jumped right in. Pretty damn good too. He's got heart. Thanks. Are you okay? - Hey, what's the matter? Clayton. - I'm a freelancer again. - You're not with The Sky Beacon anymore? - I guess I was a little bit blunt sometimes. - Yeah, people did sorta hate you. - I gotta get out of here. - No no no, you can't leave now. Everyone's expecting to see your work. The show starts at five. - I got one piece. - That's all most of the featured artists have, don't worry about it. - Hey. - Hi Lisa, you all set? - Yeah, yeah I think so. - Okay. - You okay? - He's one of us now. He can even compete for the prize. He got fired. - No kidding? - Did you just say prize? - Of course there's a prize. This one's a good one. 10,000 bucks. Second place is five, third is two. - Maybe I'll just stick around after all. - May the best work win. - She's a pretty good artist. - Yeah. - Her stuff always wins. - Yeah, we'll see. (ominous hip hop music) - I was afraid you wouldn't show. This is amazing. No, no really, this is really good. - Thank you. - Your work is so... Sensitive and beautiful. Kinda an unfair advantage. You being so gifted and all. Oh, you made it through fast. - Well nothing has really jumped out so far. - We still have to go through and see the other side. - I'd like you to meet MJ Clayton. These are our judges, Tom and Susie Klienschmidt. - Hi, how do you do. - They have a gallery in New York and have quite a reputation for recognizing talent. - You're so kind. - Now this, this is what I'm talking about. Susie, look at this. - Is this yours? - Yeah. - This has the passion and the brilliance. Wow. Honey? - What number is this? Does this have a number? - No no, it was a late entry. Just write down Clayton. He only has the one. - Clayton. - Well I can tell you that this is one of the top entries so far. - Congratulations, MJ. - MJ Clayton, that sounds familiar to me, do I know you? Do I, huh? - Wait a minute, you're that art critic. From Chicago, right? - Well he was. He's a full time artist now. - Finally got fired? - Well it was a long story. - This is a much better gig for you. You were a bad critic. People hated you. But this, this is amazing. You've got a future if you keep this up. - What do you call it? The painting? Your painting has a name maybe? - It's got an interesting story. Now one... - Grandma's Eyes. I mean that's what I would call it if it didn't have a name yet. - Yeah. - Oh, Lisa. - Yes. - I'd like you to meet our judges, Tom and Susie Klienschmidt. - So nice to meet you, it's a pleasure. - Likewise. - I've heard a lot about you guys. - Thank you. - Are you enjoying the island? - Oh it's been wonderful. Are you one of the artists? - I am. I am, and my painting's actually just down there at the end. - We'll be down there in a minute. - Perfect. - This is amazing. - You think? - Oh yes. - This one is truly inspired, you can tell. - Yeah you can. - We should get going. We're supposed to finish the judging by eight and that's about a half hour. - We'll see you all later. - See you later. - Clayton sure is amazing, isn't he? - It's funny to be under so much, I'm not used to being under all the... - So what... - That one back there, Grandma's Eyes was it? - Yeah? - That one is in a league of its own here. - I know, and everything else is pretty good, but that's got something, I don't know, special. - It's breathtaking. - Okay, so let's keep going and see what else is out there, but I already know what I'm gonna vote for. Okay? - Look, I'm sorry you lost you job, but... But maybe it's just what you needed. Now you have plenty of time to devote to your work. I mean this is a major contribution. The judges were sure impressed. - Yeah, yeah they were. - So are you gonna stick around now that you got some time on your hands? - No I'm not. I cannot afford to "stick around" I have to get to Chicago and get my name out there. - I still like that. I like it a lot. - It's quite impressive. - But, but but but but. - Well it looks like we have a winner. - Hands down. - You've seen this one over here right? - No, thank you. - Perhaps not. - Excuse me. Oh my God. Honey. - Now we've got a contest. - Do you know? - Who did this? Lisa Williston? - It's number 68, it's titled Margaret. - Margaret. - Margaret. - She is so talented. - Gifted. - Well it's almost eight o'clock, are you ready? - Will you give me a minute? - Sure. I'll meet you over there. - Thank you all for inviting us to be a part of your Island Art Festival. As you can see we had the chance to view some amazing work. You should all be very happy with the quality of the show. Give yourself a hand. (applause) - Our job is to pick the top three pieces of art based on our personal and professional opinions. First, we want to thank everyone who submitted their work and especially Mary Beth and her committee for organizing this wonderful event. (applause) - Okay, let's get right to it, shall we? Susie. - All right, here we go, and I'd ask you to please hold your applause until after I announce the title of the painting, thank you. The third place Island Festival Award, $2,000 in cash goes to Kathleen Myers for her entry Setting Suns. - Oh thank you. (applause) - All right, Kathleen! - Okay, so are you ready to announce what we have for second place? - This was a tough one, but there were a couple of entries that stood out above the rest. - That's right. This level of art can only be created when all of the elements line up and then it takes on a life of its own. - The winner of the second place award, $5,000 in cash, goes to... Frank Denham for Seduction. (applause) - Thank you so much. - Bravo. - Thank you so much, I appreciate it. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - And the first place grand prize of $10,000 for the 12th annual Island Art Festival, goes to... - A beautiful acrylic titled... Margaret, Lisa Williston! (applause) - Thank you so much. - Such a beautiful piece of work. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Leaving us so soon? - Yeah. - Hey what happened last night, you were a shoo-in. - I pulled it. You know I didn't really paint that picture. - Of course I knew. - No you didn't. - Yes I did. - No you didn't! - Yeah. - Okay, if that's so, then why didn't you blow the whistle on me? - Are you kidding me? I wanted you to win and then get your ass disqualified when the truth came out. That alone would've been worth the price of admission. - Wow. - Hey, you screwed me over pretty good you know. Now listen, what does the MJ stand for anyway? - Nothing. I just like the sound of it. - Come on, what is it? - Milton Jazz. - Milton Jazz? - My parents liked the poet and music, so they named me Milton Jazz, you have no idea how close I came to being called Shelley Scat. - Yeah, well that explains quite a bit. Hey. - Hi guys. Hey there, honey. - Well where are you kids off too, huh? - Well I got a tip that a gallery in New York is looking for a buyer, so Mary Beth and I are gonna check it out. I don't know, maybe I can sell that. - I'm sure you can. Oh hey. - Hey. - You all ready? - Yup. - (mumbles). - Okay, see yeah. - You know what, I'm gonna be watching your work. - Wonderful. - So I got something fun to tell you. You know that review you thought killed your show? - Yeah? - I didn't write it. - What are you talking about, of course you did. - No I did not. None of the reviews I wrote that week got printed. Some other guy wrote them. - You're kidding me. - No, although from the sound of it I could have written it, but I didn't. - Jeez. Maybe my stuff really does suck. - You won second place. That doesn't mean your stuff doesn't suck, but it's, listen, don't pay attention to damn critics. - Hey! Hey, you forgot the. (remixed acoustic guitar music) (country rock music) (laughing) - Cut please. - Okay. Yes, you know what, you know how upset I am, I'm not even looking at the road. (laughing) - That show was supposed to run, it... (laughing) In two weeks. The Famous Jackass Art Critic Loses 500 Bucks Making Stick Figure... - You smell of cloves. (laughing) - No he doesn't, that's me. - Hey, I just thought of something. No seriously! - This is good beer. - Are you on the package for Brawny paper towels? You're not, you're not rolling. - No, I'm not rolling, no. - You are you liar. (laughing) - To art! Whoever the hell he is. (laughing) - I heard you were on the islands. (laughing) I had (mumbles). - Was it good, bro? (laughing) (laughing) - Okay, that's funny. - My. Clayton. (laughing) You have to leave! - Oh! (laughing) - I thought this would be silly! (laughs) That's good! (laughing) (loud bang) - Oh! - (laughs) See, now you have a hole, like perfect hole through you. - And that's the point of view, when I stand up it's just your (mumbles). (applause) - Chris Koury, ladies and gentlemen. - It's cause you're acting drunk though. - I'm not acting anymore, right John? - We are drunk. It's become reality. (typing noises)
