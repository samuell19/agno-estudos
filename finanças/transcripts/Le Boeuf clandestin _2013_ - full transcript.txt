THE SECRET BEEF I wonder why you always have an undone button. I'll have lunch with Mr. EphraTm. I asked Julia to cook your favorite veggie. Zucchini? Turn around. You have dandruff everywhere. - Your father will eat with his boss. - You're getting a raise? - I don't know. - They'll become partners! "EphraTm-Berthaud Bank". It would be dandy! I don't think it'll happen. It's from Mr. Maurice. Roberte, you read it first. Go ahead, my child. So, did he get a permission? His regiment is confined. His regiment? In that case... He wants a French-Spanish dictionary. Another fad? Before, it was poet'ry. He loved Aragon and Eluard. My son is like me. He likes reading. You only like books that make you cry. My daughter is like me. Nothing's better than an accounting book. Goodbye Au bon Boeuf Monday, March 9th, 1936 Did you hear? These gentlemen don't want to pay. We didn't say that. We will pay what we ate. Vegetables, not meat. - It must be a joke. - No, we're vegetarian. And we let the waiter know. You don't make the law. Do you know where you are? Au Bon Boeuf! That's beef. You eat meat here. You want some water and cookies, like in the hospital? Let's be reasonable or I'll take you for chiseling. Why would you come here if you don't eat meat? To set an example. That's enough! Will you pay? - No! - Very well. You'll talk to the police chief then. Wait, I'll pay you. Here you have. - I'll go get the change. - No, keep it. Keep the change. This is the France I like! Gentlemen, I invite you all a drink. What's wrong with you? Oh, alright. There. Thank you. My God, is she slow. The priest said in his sermon that Socialists were bad French. We're certainly leaning to the right. I don't like priests talk about politics. You should come. I'd lose my job. I can't afford that. My boss is a Jew and a freemason. I can't be seen there. In fact, I don't believe in anything. Dad is right, and that attitude might just boost his promotion. Julia, be careful! You stained the tablecloth. You know my husband is a vegetarian. By the time she brings the carrots, they'll be cold. She's too slow. She's cheaper because of her disability. Everyone will know I have a discount maid. Considering what I pay for her, she's not inexpensive at all. Thank you. You look at me as if it was the first time. I've been a vegetarian for two years. You should be used to it. Of course. I want to get into it, too. Me too. Me being a vegetarian doesn't imply you should be one. Not everyone can follow that diet. When Maurice arrives, he'll want to eat meat. Clearly, she wants to get out. Make up your mind. Wasn't she too slow for you? - No dessert? - I have work to do. You won't come to the Dulatres? I need all the afternoon to write this file. As you wish. Did I mention Philippe Lardut will be there? Who? Philippe Lardu, that young engineer. He's in the army. Your father is admirable. Not only is he a vegetarian, he works hard, too. That's true. Why I appreciate above all is his loyalty and strictness. Julia, will you bring the dessert? Hurry up, we're going to be late. My God, my hair looks awful. I don't like it this flat. I would like to have a shorter, sculpted cut. What do you think? Where's your grosgrain coat? It's not warm enough. You're not dressed appropriately. Would you help me? Let's see. - Tidy up! You're all bundled up... - Stop! Open that coat a little bit. Make yourself more chic. I don't care about gallant remarks. That's pretty obvious. Philippe Lardut won't give you any kind of romance. Well, I like him. He's close to his village roots. The land doesn't lie. And I want a grounded husband, not a dreamer. I simply don't understand your crush on that simpleton. Believe me, romance in a couple may seem trite, but it makes a wife's life beautiful. Open that coat a little bit. Make yourself more chic. Your mushy eloquence... You hear too many songs in that radio. Don't forget he's a Mines school graduate, and as soon as he leaves the army... Dang! ls there no room for reasonable young ladies who want to keep a house and have a calm life? Your dad wants you to marry a banker. I don't think he'll appreciate your choice. I'll convince him. Philippe is not a fortune-hunter. Dad will like that. I hope you don't get too disappointed. I can't stand that orange-wedge smile of yours! You need someone like him. That smoldering look, that velvety voice... God, I like him! Mom, don't start again! A crooner? How dreadful! - My Goodness! - What is it? - I forgot my book. - Which one? Gone with the Wind. I promised I would give it back. Too bad! I need that book. I told him I would give it back! You just wait here. I'll go get it for you. It's in the office, on the sideboard. It's a big book. I wrapped it in crystal paper to avoid any damages. Dad, it's me. Dad, where are you? It's me. All this blood is disgusting. I'm looking for a snack. I'm hungry. Of course you are. You only eat vegetables. They are quick to digest. I feel lighter, though. It's better for my job. You're not a dreamer. It's nice to have a grounded, conscious dad. It's just strength of conviction. Not everyone can boast about being respectable. Weren't you going to the Dulatres? - Mom forgot her book. - What book? - Gone with the Wind. - I don't know it. Really, Dad? Everyone talks about it! Not at the bank. My sweet little Dad. Slave crowd, get up, get up! The world must change its base We are nothing Let's be everything You see, madam, youth wants something new, bread and work. Don't you sense a blast of hope? The elections are in May. Tell your husband to vote for us. - I don't know... - But, Mom! Be prudent, please! Those are the bad French the priest was talking about. The Popular Front will win, as in Spain. They're not bad. They seduce people with their words of hope and freedom. This is not Russia, you know. Blah, blah, yes. The French won't believe those idlers. We're going to be late. Slow down, please. Bravo, young man. That was beautiful. Thank you. Mozart makes it easier. Ah, my dear Philippe. They finally let you go out. You just missed Eustache's performance. You don't always have the chance to have a musician in the family. How are you, old boy? When will you demob? We'll talk another time. Duty awaits. You're leaving? I've just arrived. It's an utterly important matter. My dear friends! Please grant me a few minutes. After this delightful musical interlude, a much more serious matter: your well-being. It is my pleasure to offer you my specialty. This wonderful wartscide that puts and end to any dreadful wart, even the most persistent ones. My daughter Josette is mischievous, just like her mother. And that's not all. I have developed for some time an excellent medicine for you, ladies. The Regulatine. No more painful periods and other nuisances. So we guys don't count for anything? Thank you all. The buffet is now open. Josette, come and help me. Serve the meringues. She made them herself. A good deed for the suffering humankind. Speaking of suffering, I'd like to ask you for advice. You have calluses? No, but I have this languor... Languor? That's interesting. Let's talk about it in my office. You have gained a pound. A pound? That's not possible. - Have you tared your scale? - Of course. Tell me about that languor... Well... Women are naturally less materialistic than men. They lack their mental resistance, their greater vitality. - Really? - Which affects the nervous system. - Of course. That languor... Do they happen after meals? Not really, doctor. Actually... Actually... I'm terribly constipated. - Constipated? - Yes. About time! I mean, yes, I understand... Have you tried prunes and Vichy's Fructines? Vichy's Fructines, prunes... None of that was effective. Alright, I see. There's Plombiéres. It's a health resort specialized in that kind of illnesses. I'd like to recommend you a colleague of mine, but in the meantime, I'll prescribe you a purge. And most important, don't eat any chocolate! Mom, I've decided to invite Philippe home. - Excuse me, doctor. - We had already finished. - When? - A Sunday. - But Sundays are for family. - Exactly. Allow me to approve your inclination. Philippe is part of the family, so to speak. I've know him for years. He's a reliable young man. And very judicious. A romance with your daughter would be charming. - We'll talk to your father. - I've made my decision. Well... I've been waiting for an hour. Don't reproach me. I was at Monette Amona's. Of course, I was hold back. Don't scold me. I was worried you were alone. Anyway, an hour late, and you were at Monette Amona's... You can say it. What a big-head she is! She invites her friends to show them her 25000-francs house. But she didn't surprise me at all. I know who she is, I worked with her. Read my lips, she would have never entered the cinema world if Kochma hadn't pay to make her act in The Alabaster Mask. To be fair, she has talent. Talent? You think Monette Amona has talent? She shows her legs in the film. My legs are much nicer and I'm far more talented than her. Without Kochma, she would have fallen into oblivion forever. She holds Kochma by the senses. That is disgusting. Come on, calm down. She called me Georgette all the afternoon. She knows I'm not Georgette anymore. You are too nervous, my dear. By the way, I heard a novel is going to be adapted, Love has passed by me. It's a nice title. Very spruce. There will be roles for ladies. We should do something. We will see. We should mull over the idea. Mull over... It will be too late then. The others are moving. It's always the same. It will always be the same. All my life. You promised you would help me, though. Listen, my dear, I will call Berthaud, my banker. He has connections. I will ask him for a meeting to talk about it. You will call him? When? I will do it right away, right now. Are you haPPY7 My kitty cat, will you stay with Leucé this evening? - Oh, I'm sorry! - Excuse me! My dear director. I had never seen you outside the bank. It's an honor, General. You look pale to me. Are you alright? I'm just tired. You should have a seat. Let me offer you something. A drink might suit you... Well... My dear director, I won't take your time. You look much better now. I'll go to the bank. I have an investment to make. Let's talk about that. I believe a good relationship with the client is the best way to help him achieve his financial goals. - Absolutely, that is true! - Refill, please! I have always find you so nice! I invite you to dinner, so we can know each other better. I would be honored. I hope I won't bother you. Of course not. You should come. L'm sorry. It would be my pleasure. My little statuette! What statuette? A charming Chinese statuette. I have a Bouguereau at home. Since you look like... a man with taste, I'd like to know your opinion. Bouguereau... The real Bouguereau. My dear director, in matters of painting, I'm just an amateur. You will also meet my wife and my daughter, roast beef. Roast beef... Roast beef? ls that your daughter's name? Your daughter, Roast Beef. What? Well no, her name is Roberte! Oh, Roberte! You're such a pert! You are... There, I'll pay the check. Keep the change! It's the grey one. Yours? No, yours! When you look at it, you can see it conveys grief and sorrow... Oh, really? I thought she was sleeping. You can only understand it if you know Bouguereau, a very big artist. You won't see paintings of any other painter. Bouguereau would kill them all. Of course. Bouguereau is... ls Bouguereau. Of course. As an Art amateur, I'm very picky myself. You didn't turn off the radio? Sure I did. It's the neighbor upstairs. A young bar pianist. He's rather good-looking. He has blue eyes, with long eyelashes like stone collectors! He does collect a few. - Not only him... - What do you mean? I know what I mean. General, what's extraordinary with this painting is that you always find new elements to look at. Shall we sit down to dinner? I was about to say that! Over here. Let me tell you, it's a potluck dinner. My dear Mrs. Berthaud... Do you like roast beef, General? Absolutely! Particularly when it's cold. Cold roast beefs are actually more tasty than hot ones. They're better, too. They're easier to cut. I shouldn't say all this. My husband is a vegetarian! Really? I would have never imagined. Your husband doesn't have the complexion of a vegetarian. That is true. However, he has been one for two years. He started when Maurice, our eldest, left for his military service. My compliments. I wouldn't have the will. In these two years of you being a vegetarian, have you tried to eat meat again? No, never. When you're a vegetarian it's because you don't like meat. You don't feel the need, that's all. Dad is modest. He has more merit than he will admit. Yes, he is really very modest. You're right. Your father is a man of virtue, who overcomes temptations in every meal. No, thank you. Personally, the fact I'm eating with you won't... make me decide to become a vegetarian. This meat is succulent. The mustard, please. I have accredited suppliers. That's true. This meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork. Could we please change the subject? Why? Meat is interesting. I find fatty meat much more tasty than lean meat. What do you think, General? Yes, you're right. What's your opinion, Dad? Nothing. General, about Bouguereau's painting, you didn't tell me what you think? Oh, yes. Bouguereau! Well, Bouguereau... - Bouguereau is Bouguereau. - Absolutely. I have to say she needs some nipples. I don't like these shifty shapes. A woman without nipples is uninteresting. You have nowhere to look. However, Dr. Dulatre finds them well-proportioned and symmetrical. If Dr. Dulatre says so... I haven't had the honor of meeting him, but his wartscide is a very good product and very useful for the troops. I'm glad he invented it. I won't fail to tell him. About his Regulatine, he told me how affected he was regarding what women revealed to him. If you're interested in meeting him, I can arrange that. That's true. Thursday is my day, and this Thursday, precisely, I will receive the Dulatres! Mrs. Berthaud, that's very kind of you. - I don't want to inconvenience you. - It'd be my pleasure. Mr. Eustache is on the phone, sir. Speaking of the Dulatres, there we have one. Excuse me, please. I'm going to withdraw. I'm tired. My respects, Miss. General, are you a poet? You're addressing to a hopeless romantic. You have the profile. Do you know I too am a fan of the radio? You too, General? My husband hates it. He finds it vulgar. Mr. Berthaud... May I ask for your permission to invite your daughter to my box, at the Opera? I didn't expect such a question. You have known Roberte for just a few hours. At my age, you have no time to lose. Come on in. You wanted to talk to me about your protégée. I'm sorry I called you at home. But, you see, it was an urgent situation... Miss Leucé Dinguet, a colleague's daughter, has a vocation for cinema. She actually has a magnificent talent. She's currently going through... a tough moment in her career. As you know, the producers are happy to have us help them discover exceptionally gifted actors. My dear Eustache, I would be naturally glad to serve your projects. But I wonder how I could help you. I heard your boss' son has a cinematographic production company. I know the EphraTms. In business, friendship matters don't have any value. A recommendation would be utterly useless. But that's the risk with these kind of approaches. And I'm sure Miss Leucé is ready to take it. The important thing is to know if you're good with it. I would be delighted to help you! I promise I will do my best. But I fear you will be disappointed. I appreciate that. You're very kind. It occurred to me maybe you should see Miss Dinguet before talking to EphraTm. What do you think? Yes, certainly. Could we set up a date? Yes. Well, let's say... Tomorrow? Tomorrow at 2 pm, here. ls that OK to you? Tomorrow at 2 pm, then. Say hello to your father. ls he in his lab? Yes, always! I sometimes regret not having followed the same path. Dedicating all his time to research is having a life of devotion and abnegation. There's nothing as pure as that. Don't you think? Well, yes. - See you tomorrow! - Goodbye. "A tough moment"! What a moron. This is the Parisian radio. We're back to The Chouillon Family, your series presented by Les Cycles Dubois. It was the pharmacist. He has an affair with the butcher. Not in front of the kids! Zilchy zilch! They're grown enough to understand. Your soup lacks salt. "Zilchy zilch!" I like that. Your doctor prohibited the salt. Don't even get me started. He knows nothing. What an interesting character... Did you know he used to get it on with the pharmacist? I told you: Not in front of the kids! I hope I don't bother you with the piano, miss. No, I like music. All the better. I think of you while I play! You're insane! Let me pass. Mom! - Zilch! - What, zilch? Don't you hear me? Zilchy zilch. You're bothering me. I'm listening to my series. It's noon. You're still in your nightgown! So? You're father won't come for lunch. I'm worried. He must have problems. Digestion problems, probably. Mom, get dressed! Hurry! Someone could come! Oh really? Who? General d'Amandine? Leave me alone with that old fossil. He seems to have a tender inclination towards you. Give me a massage, please. That old codger, with those affected poses and that conceited attitude... He likes you, he's a good match. Mom, he could be my grand-father! Besides, I'm marrying Philippe Lardut. He won't talk to you about love with the same tenderness as the General. I couldn't care less about tenderness. I prefer acts to dumb speeches. I hope you haven't... Your father won't allow this union. He didn't want you to graduate to keep you away from unfortunate relationships. - "Unfortunate relationships"? - Yes. University means Bolshevists, etcetera. No, believe me, there are far more ambitious suitors than Philippe Lardut! And I have very good arguments to convince Dad. Really? Which ones? You'll see... Your orange-wedge smile doesn't mean anything to me. Mom, go get dressed, please! Yes... You have been quite haughty for some time! My children keep on surprising me. They do. Thank God there's still someone coherent here. Are you sure? What a pity! You barely talked with the General. I'm sorry. An appendicitis can't wait. What about that languor? - I'm feeling much better! - Good! - My best wishes to Mr. Berthaud. - Yes. Thank you! I want your brownies recipe! My husband loves them! How curious. My husband loves them too! - Mr. Berthaud won't come? - You know, the bank... But he promised he would be here by 5 pm. Miss Roberte, I like you. I would be delighted to take you to the opera. Thank you, but I know nothing about music. You should invite my mother. She likes lyrical music. Please, help yourself. I made them myself. You have an inclination for baking? It's one of my specialties. I love cooking. Young ladies should be encouraged to practice the art of cooking. A happy household depends on a satisfied belly. It's delicious. Really delicious. So many indulgences! Philippe! Not here! I'll see you tomorrow, at 3 pm. I've been waiting. What a shame, my seam just cracked. Do you have a pin? Yes, come with me. You will stay, right? I'll be right back. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. Thank you. General d'Amandine. Philippe Lardut, reservist at the Poissy barracks. 3rd infantry regiment. Infantry? Congratulations, young man. Is everything doing good? Absolutely. I see you met each other! How charming. I think that monocle suits you very well. Really? It helps me keep my single status. Are you against marriage? I am. Certainly, a monocle does not replace a wife, but it's a matter of habit. At first, it's a real problem. You see, I bought a piece of chamois leather I have in my pocket and whenever I think about marriage, I take my monocle off, I clean it with my chamois leather and I put it back. It's extremely relaxing. When I polish my monocle, I have a very nice feeling of melancholy Would you tempt yourself again? No, thank you. I'm good. My I take two? Thank you. Have a seat. Don't be intimidated. So this is the office of a bank director? Dear, we're not at the cinema! I didn't expect this. The setting is not as important as the contents of our safes. Believe me, there is some money here! Mr. Berthaud is a prince of finances. Don't exaggerate. What matters to me is to please my clients in the best way possible. It wasn't for you. I don't trust bankers. But I would trust my fortune to you if I had one. Well, I would gladly take yours. Excuse me. If I may, you could have a decisive role in that matter. I have an article... What did I make of it? The article of Love has passed by. What? It's the name of the novel that inspires the film. Oh, what an idiot! L think I left it in the hall. I will be right back. Go ahead. I live close to here, at 9, Boulevard Comte. Come tonight, at 6 pm. We'll discuss this calmly. - Tonight? - Will you come? At 6 pm? Yes. Alright, it's right here. I see... Now I have to convince Mr. EphraTm and his son. I'll take care of it. Miss Dinguet can provide some photos to support her application. - I have photos. Portraits. - Yes, portraits. And some pretty poses. We'll see that later. For the moment, let me initiate this negotiation artfully. I will inform you about the result of my moves. Alright then... Goodbye. See you soon. Why should I say no? I should enjoy it while I can Enough already! I'll do it myself. It will calm me down. What's the matter? The matter is I'm here bending over backwards while your father has a good time! What do you mean? Not in front of Julia. What will my guests think of me? He should have come at 5, he didn't. He didn't even call! He's probably at the bank, that's all. Don't you think it's weird he doesn't eat at home anymore? It's circumstantial. His work demands him. No, no! It's not circumstantial! One day is Mr. EphraTm, another day, he must travel. Something's off, I can sense it. You haven't noticed anything? No. Someday, he'll come back at midnight. At midnight or the day after! You want to know what I think? I think he has an affair. I'm sure he does! - He has an affair. - No... I know how a husband's escapades can be! You'll eat all that? Worries make me hungry! Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I wanted to keep the secret but I don't want you to fret over it. Here's what happened. The other day, I surprised him stuffing himself with meat at Le Bon Boeuf. He wanted to eat meat? I could've prepared him a beefsteak! He didn't want us to know. He got caught, and you understand the rest... What should I understand? It's simple. He was caught in the act. What a humiliation for a self-proclaimed vegetarian! My poor child, you reason like a kid. He might have been offended. Men are very vain about trivial matters. But to make them timid... I'm sure the idea of having a meal with me is dreadful for him. To lose face is terrible for his authority. Don't try to find complicated reasons. The truth is he has an affair! In any case, it'd be recent. Who knows! Everything's possible! It wouldn't surprise me. He's an important man. Speaking of the devil... That's him. He forgot his keys again. Ladies. Excuse me, but a letter was mistakenly slid under my door. It's for you. That's very kind of you. Sorry for the bother. What a handsome man! Have you seen his eyes? - It's from Lardut! - Lardut? It's a letter from Lardut, your Lardut. Philippe. He's sorry, he won't have lunch with us on Sunday. He must join hastily... a military instruction camp at... I can't figure out what he says. His writing is awful! He didn't say anything to me! He probably didn't know before. He talks about me? Yes. - He sends best wishes. - That's all? It must be a joke! No, it's not a joke. Your dad's escapades aren't either. Here. Eat this, my child. I'm looking for... If it is for Miss Georgette, she's at the 7th floor, to the left. I'm looking for Miss Leucé. Exactly, that's Georgette. 7th floor, to the left. Wipe your feet, sir. L'm sorry. What a loose! I'm so glad you're here! I couldn't wait to see you! I haven't stopped thinking about our meeting. It's a tiny apartment, but it's enough for me. I'm an artist. I don't spend much time at home. Yes, I... - Would you like a finger of port? - Of course. It's like in business. You must see people. It's not always nice. A tiny apartment like this one... where you can rest calmly is a very relaxing thing. We have the same convictions. We'll be very good friends. I think so... My God! How awful. This dressed cost me 700 francs. You should wash it with warm water. Rub it with Marseille soap if you have some. Some people dust salt on it to absorb the wine. What do you think? No, I... You should wash it with soap with a slightly humid cloth. Then you rub it with a hard brush. Do it as much as necessary. Do you think a toothbrush could do it? Of course, it's a brush! This place is charming. I don't know, you feel... Comfortable. I bought some boudoirs. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll pay you back for it. No, it doesn't matter! Wait, no! I will buy you... I'll buy you another couch! - But... - No, I insist! I'll buy you a couch. I'll try to find the same color. What an odd guy! 399 you! What? It's the first time you see me? You don't know me? Do I smell like pété? Damn! This is my house! I will eat outside tonight! He has an affair. Come on, mother! Don't start again! You know I'm right. Anyhow, I don't care. I don't want to know. - You'll see when you're married. - Stop the nonsense! By Khe 'NEW-- what about the French-Spanish book? The dictionary? Yes, I ordered it. I'm waiting for it. About time. Now he wants to learn Spanish. Ow, ow, ow, ouch, ouch, ouch, I have calluses in my feet. I'm in hell. Ow, ow, ow, ouch, ouch, ouch. My life has changed thanks to Lucifer. With Lucifer wartscide, no more calluses in your feet. No more than 5 minutes. It can burn the scalp. I want curls, not a burn! You think it'll work? - I hope. It cost a fortune. - I was talking about Philippe and I. I was wondering if it would be opportune to write to him. Don't let the iron get cold. It must curl both sides. I think it's useless. He's not very much into letters. - It's not his style. - His style displeases me to death. If you ask me, I consider his silence as a gift from heaven. Why? Forget about him, my child. I was loved by my husband like very few women are. And what happened? We have been married for only 30 years, and he's already eating outside, etc. You tell me. Wait, Mom! Why would you wait for a man who left for several weeks without even sending you a postcard? I'm asking you. I look good, don't I? Yes. About my daughter again... Should she marry a military man? Why not? You want her to be happy? Of course! But then... You're complicated! That's middle-class problems. So, Yvonne, you took your boss out tonight? They day my boss comes here, pigs will fly. We've just met and I already know all his life. Isn't it? It feels good to have a friendly ear. - About my daughter... - Stop torturing yourself! Whatever we do, children are trouble. Little children, little trouble, big children, big trouble. I know what I'm talking about. I have 4. Let's go! No, I'm not in the mood. You didn't come here to rest. Come on! I don't like it. Julia! - Madame. - What is it? Your son, Maurice Berthaud, disappeared a week ago. He's a deserter now. My Goodness... A deserter? - What will happen to him? - The council of war. He could go to prison. Prison? L'm sorry. I saw an officer coming out of our house. Did something happen? Maurice... Maurice! What happened to Maurice? What happened to him? Speak already! He deserted! He deserted? You bet... I understand now. French-Spanish. That moron is in Spain! In Spain? We need to call Dad. You do it. I don't have the courage. In Spain... It's a Japanese vegetal food. You can eat it in many ways. Use your fingers. It has more qualities than meat. Excuse me. Yes, hello? I'm coming. - Is there a problem? - My son is a deserter. That is upsetting. Where is he? My daughter fears he might have... joined the Spanish Popular Front. Are you serious? Those people are Bolshevists! That's annoying. And the bank? I'm going home to see if I can solve this. I'm going home to see if I can solve this. Alright! But don't spread the news. Be discreet. Your son is in the hands of Bolshevists! I don't understand... In Spain! My son is not a Bolshevist! He likes poetry! Poetry! Eluard, Aragon! I'm absolutely lost. He was found guilty of desertion in times of peace. He gets a 3-year prison sentence. My friend! We need to talk to General d'Amandine. He has... He has good connections. He could help Maurice avoid prison. It's an awful disgrace. Absolutely not. He's a client and a neighbor. My position is at risk! Only Mr. EphraTm knows about it. He made my swear I would maintain the greatest of discretion. What about my marriage? With my brother in prison, I'll end up my days as an old maid. I know what you mean! What about the Dulatres reception? We won't be able to go! Maurice was going to come. They'll ask questions! It's horrible! Let's calm down and think. He won't enter this house again! I assure you... Shall I prepare Mr. Maurice's room for Sunday? In case he gets his permission! No! The regiment is confined. There is an epidemic of... scarlet fever. Epidemics can happen. Their colonel infected them. It's a disaster! I makes me want to scratch myselfl Come on in, my child. I'm flattered by your visit. I'm shaking the dust. I hope it doesn't bother you. I've decided to revive my figurines collection. Look. - That's lovely. - Very instructive, yes. You should take some time to see. I would like to make something clear... Don't bother. There's no misunderstanding between us. I can't blame me for trying. Please, have a seat. How are your parents doing? They are good. But we have been worried since this morning. My Goodness! My brother Maurice, who does his service in Colmar, has deserted. He will appear before the council of war. The council of war! Do you want some sake? It's Japanese. Yes, why not. The council of war. That's pretty serious. You were right to come. So, Colmar it is? Colmar... Here it is. Colmar. In times of political disorder, these matters are nothing but red tape. The Socialists don't have military flair. Here. I have the name of a friend who can intervene in Maurice's case. I'll write to him. He'll answer me this week. Relax. I'll make sure nothing happens to Maurice. General, I don't know how to thank you. No, don't thank me. Sit down. Let me ask you a favor. A really important favor. Alright. I have decided to get married. I've just started this project. I need a match. I don't want an old lady. I would like a young girl. Many young girls are attracted by the prestige of the uniform. You think so? The uniform... The uniform... The uniform doesn't bring fortune. This marriage has to be a good deal. Besides, you know, the uniform is not so... Well, anyway. The thing is, I noticed a young lady at your mother's. What's her name? - Josette Dulatre. - Yes! That's right. Josette. I would like to meet her. With or without her parents. Can I count on you? General, I must give you a very compromising information. I'm listening. I would feel guilty if I didn't tell you. Josette is not a serious girl. It's just an impression, I can't confirm it. She's not so serious? I have no proof. But Josette is a little bit... - A little bit? - Olé olé... Olé, olé... Really? I'll try to figure it out by myself. Anyhow, I'm informed thanks to you. General. In another time, we were made for each other. I'm certain. I will set up a meeting with Josette. Thank you. Josette! I'm here, Mom! Are you ready? We must go to the dressmaker's. I won't go. I'm tired. Yes, you're kind of pale. I understand, my child. You have your period. Hello, Roberte! Who? Oh my, but he's an old man! Yes, alright! Tomorrow at 2 pm. What is it? You're all red. Nothing, it's Roberte. - So you won't come then? - No, I will have some rest. You should ask your father to examine you. You should have called. I have work. And if you came to... I don't care about you eating meat. It's about my marriage. I fixed Maurice's troubles. I talked to the General. It's all good. That moron won't go to prison. The General is a libertine. You didn't... You preferred disgrace? The General is a decent man. He settled everything. I was right. Someone had to do something. Are you saying I'm not a good head of household? Speaking of that, I was wondering what your game is. I'm not in command anymore! In command of what? Disorder? Chaos? You won't talk to me like that. Dad, you can't forbid me anything. 'L wonder what Mr. EphraTm would think if he knew you eat meat. Don't do that! I don't know. It's all up to you. I'm going to reassure Mom. Julia prepared some potatoes since you're a vegetarian. We'll wait you for lunch. You better become worthy of our Catholic values. We're up for 7 years of Popular Front. What a tragedy! It's the final battle Be careful, you nasty little thugs! - This will take an ugly turn. - Of course. I shouldn't say this. Your son... - By the way, any news of him? - None. He won't go to jail. It's a start. My wife is still disturbed by this. It's awful to be flustered by one's kids. You have managed to save your dignity in this ordeal. The bank wasn't affected. I appreciate that. The discipline you've taught me is the best example of a right behavior. - Really? - Really. I'm glad to hear that. Gentlemen, this is the day of your lives. If you buy this razor for only 5 francs, 5 coins of 20 cents instead of 20 francs, I will give you these blades. It's the American methods to seduce the public. An exclusive offer for you: this beard soap that costs 3 francs in every store. It's reasonable. - Do you want one! - Why not. Alright then... Right, let's see... How much is it? 10 francs. - For both? - For everything. 10 francs for everything is a bargain. Thank you! - Thank you. - Have a nice day. After the election it all went down! I didn't think they would start a strike. The Reds dare to everything! Ask for L'Humanité! The Communist Party will make a happier France! Thanks, comrade. L'Humanite! The German chancellor threatens the Spanish republic! Isn't the music too loud? On the contrary, it helps me. I have wings in my feet. So basically, what is going on between Lardut and Roberte? What? I was saying... What is it between Lardut and Roberte? Nothing. Philippe Lardut doesn't write to her. Roberte is to proud to make the first move. - That's it. - Basically, they split. There's no reason for it to improve. Love is fresh. We'll have to remind her of her manners. How come? She has to get married! That relationship was hasty. I though you didn't like him. I wouldn't like her to take anyone out of spitefulness. That would be strange! Just imagine... Dogs don't make cats! - She's like you! - Good. We have had enough trouble with Maurice. I must say the wartscide and Regulatine sells are quickly dropping. Dad, I warned you. You have to advertise! It's like that today. That's why the Lucifer is so successful: because of publicity! That would be strange! A researcher can't live from his discoveries and must resort to methods that I better not brand. It is necessary. And allow me to give you an idea. I know, I could pass a couple of ads on the radio for Regulatine and the wartscide. It would be completely useless to spend your money on a radio ad. - You'd lose your investment. - That's your opinion, not mine. Is the Regulatine a luxurious product? Absolutely. We know luxurious products don't have ads on the radio. The radio is addressed to the popular segments. The fancy lady who buys Regulatine won't buy it again from the day it's offered to a plumber's wife. For a specialty like this, an image ad looks much more appropriate to me. In fact, you could do some beautiful things. Imagine this. During a fancy reception, a woman. She's chic, she's elegant. All of a sudden, she staggers. She's feeling dizzy, she faints. Everyone is nervous and gathers around. Once she wakes up, a doctor takes her arm. He takes her to her car and before he leaves, he hands her a packet she'll only open at home. That packet contains a flask of Regulatine! My son! My dear son! What an imagination! My child, you make up for all these gloomy years I passed in my laboratory! I entrust you with that idea. I want you to set up that wonderful film as of tomorrow. Count on me, father! I have the actress you need. Is she a star? My son! Thanks to you and your cinema, the Lucifer wartscide will go to hell! I do ads without even knowing! You look so chic, my darling! You are so charming in that little peignoir... Be careful, you will ruin my make-up! Why did you want to see me? - I have many things to tell you. - I'm listening. I have good news. Darling, I have something really good to tell you. I have a role for you. - Really? - Yes. It's a short film, and you will be the star. I insist, the star. You will be the only woman in the film. Are you sure? It will be all good. My father will finance it. As well as another short film which you'll also be starring. I think the shooting will begin on Monday. I didn't mention it before because, trust me, darling, it wasn't an easy task. Fortunately, I'm tenacious. You're wonderful, my dear! What's the title of the film? The Followed Woman... Not bad, isn't it? Right. Have a seat. Basically, this is the script. There is this lady... She's gorgeous. She has this... sex appeal. This lady is bothered in the street by some men that follow her. She would like to run but her feet hurt. She can barely walk. She feels annoyed, she takes refuge in a pharmacy. Then, the images fades. She comes out of the store with a little packet in her hands. It's a nice start. You can do some really spicy things. Some men follow in her footsteps. She escapes. She runs so fast they lose sight of her. Close-LIP! With a triumphant smile, she takes a box out of her purse, she shows it and says: 'Thanks to the Dulatre wartscide my feet don't hurt anymore, "and I leave all my followers behind!" It's a nice idea! Wartscide... Wartscide! An ad for your father's crap! Do I look like I have warts? Get out, you disgust me! I'm an artist! Stupid moron! Get out of my sight! Give me my key back. You can't act anyway. Actually, you do. With your butt, that is! L hope it pays! You nasty Pig! I took your dirty laundry and I didn't see... You know. We'll talk about that. Are you coming? What's the matter? The matter is this young lady is late on her period. Is that true, Josette? I have warts in my feet. It's living hell. Ow, ow, ow. Ouch, ouch, ouch. My life changed thanks to Lucifer. With Lucifer wartscide, no more warts in your feet. You will have an easy walk. That is ridicule, don't you think? That ad is medieval. The future is in the cinema! Right, back to business. Don't panic, it can happen. Let's see. Stick out your tongue. It's nothing serious. You have a little anemia. You'll have two pills of Regulatine at noon and two at night. I'll check your pressure. It won't be necessary. I'm pregnant. You're pregnant... Pregnant? You do this to me? While I was breaking my back to give you a good life? If you had said it right away maybe I could have done something! There are pills for that. I don't know what holds me back. And you knew it! Oh no, my dear! You are disgusting! You nasty little girl! Oh yes, you can cry now... Who got you pregnant? Who? Come on, talk! It's General d'Amandine. The General? Three, four, five, six. No seven. Seven is a grabber. Eight, nine, ten is a grabber. The jack is a grabber. This isn't funny. Queen, king. You were lucky. I barely made an opera. You always say you have it but you actually don't. You're such a bad player! Five, six, seven. No eight. - Are you waiting for someone? - No. - Julia! - My dear, it's Sunday. Right, I'll get it. Josette! We are glad to have you here. I want to see Roberte. She's making cookies. Wait. Turn that down! You're right on time. She's getting them out of the oven. Eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, without king. Without king! I'm not deaf, but your mind is away. - Julia! - My dear, it's Sunday. Your queen is a grabber. You didn't notice. - Could we stop? - Oh no, zilch! I win. Right, your turn. King. Then... It smells delicious. Can I try one? Wait, they're sticky. Make me feel hungry! You're right. They're hot. You're eating for two. You don't know who the father is? Why the General? Why not? It cost me a lot... But I mean, the General... He is just... - He's lustful. - You mean he's an old pig! But he's a funny old pig! Will you stop it? I have the right to some sweets! Even ill people eat it! You'll get a cirrhosis of the liver. Oh, come on... You are such a party pooper! No, I just have a different vision of parties. It will soon be nothing but memories. - He's lustful. - You mean he's an old pig! - I'd like that! - Sure. I managed to save my pastries. Josette is voracious! - She won't marry any time soon. - Her father is taking care of that. Did you hear? Mr. Dulatre cares about her daughter's match. It's not my fault if Lardut doesn't write to you. It suits you well! Daddy changed his mind, didn't he? Oh, really? In that case, you should intervene. Mom is right. It's a matter to solve. It's up to you. Of course. These are men's business! I'm not the agony column. Shall we play? Alright, let's finish this hand. This time around, I'm sure I have the big opera! Yes, right... - General. - Yes, Akira? There's a doctor here. He insists on seeing you. I won't receive anyone. Get rid of that moron. Doctor Dulatre! Akira, I told you I wouldn't receive anyone. Now get out. What do you want? To talk about my daughter. I'm listening. - Josette admitted everything. - Yes. So? But sir, my daughter is pregnant. She's pregnant. Do you hear me? I'm not deaf. Pregnant... Of course she's pregnant. Of three months. You almost got me. I've come to ask you what you'll do about it. Excuse me? Are you saying you decided to come here with all that... respectability to ask for a compensation? - Exactly! A while ago, I would have sent some people do this job. But what's the point now? A kick in the ass will suffice! Sir, when your Josette gave herself to me... Yes, you heard that right. She gave herself to me! The harm was done. You knew that! Not at all! I have the honor to inform you that your Josette is a slut. You should be pleased. You'll be a grandfather. It's a misunderstanding. I thought... Maybe it's possible for you... Could you...? You're single, and I will give Josette an important dower, plus the interests on the wartscide sells... Sir. Are you offering me to marry her? That just plain disgusting... Have you noticed the age difference? I'm done with women. I've been a monk for a week. I dedicate to my memories, exclusively. Akira! Walk this gentleman to the door. That's not how it's going to be! You will hear about me! People will know about your behavior! An old man like you, taking advantage of young ladies! Sir, I wouldn't use that inappropriate term to talk about your offspring. Now get out! You Pig! That's right. Buzz off, dickhead. '"I'ino Rossi has inaugurated the dining room at Menton Royal Riviera". No wonder. He loves cooking with oil. He uses it... Dad! 'They ate fatted Mans chicken with truffles, "a cardinal turbot supreme "and plum pudding!" What a delight! Well I never! What now? The Dulatres put an ad for Josette! Really? Let me see. Here. Classified advertising: "Young lady, 20 years old, "pretty, educated, excellent family. "Dower: 300,000 francs "plus expectancies... "Due to an imprudence". That's elegant. "Wants to meet young boy, 25 years old, "liberal profession, preferably a doctor. "References needed." Poor child. Did you know? No. Dad, it is time. Yes, yes. She won't be able to wear a white dress. Mrs. Dulatre might seem young but she'll be a granny before me. There. Dad. You're not going to negotiate a deal. Of course. I will marry him as long as he likes me, I think. I guess his silence was due to his fear of... making a bad decision. How much does my dower cost? 80.000. It could go up to 100,000. Alright, I'm leaving. Dad! Dad! Yes? 80,000 is good. Don't insist on the money. It's not important. Trust me. And don't let him think I made you visit him. Besides, it's not true. You took the initiative. Be careful! Don't worry. I'll talk on behalf of me. It's normal that I want to know his intentions. I don't want him to think he's holding us. Hello and goodbye. I'm moving out. We can see that. Miss Arletty bought me two songs. I'll live somewhere else. I'll be on the radio. Will you listen to me? I will, like anybody else. Remember, be firm! - Who is he? - Our neighbor. I'm going to be famous! Famous! Dino, remember that! What on earth is this? Stop worrying. Your father is taking care of it. He'll make sure you're happy. You will be happy, my dear. You'll know the bourgeois life. You didn't always say that. Me? Are you sure? Everything's good, dear! Your father's here. That's what matters. The others don't matter as long as it stays in the house. I have my Thursdays, my chocolates and my radio. You'll see how simple and easy life can be. 85.000. 90.000... I won't go up to 100,000. No. He's a nutcase. I came here to have a few words with you. The truth is, we could have set everything up by mail but I traveled here to work and I decided to stop by. I'm delighted. Roberte has told me about your meetings at the Dulatres. And, of course, she informed me about the projects you fixed during your last encounter. "Projects" is a big word. Anyhow, those projects need to be revised. You made... a commitment, so to speak. I wouldn't talk about an engagement yet. My behavior might have been imprudent. We have barely seen each other. It's hard to be sure. That silence you have kept since you arrived here won't make you improve. I didn't write to Roberte because I felt I didn't have the right to. She didn't write either. I just want to know about your intentions. Do you have to marry my daughter? I don't want to force you, I simply want to know. Your question is a little abrupt. Not because we got jiggy we should get married. You're talking to a father, remember. I'm speaking to the man. A man who loves life. And good food! I would like to help you get decided. You see, the current times are uncertain. I feel rather anxious about having to maintain a household with so little money at first. I understand your concerns, but Roberte's dower is rather... comfortable. It's a 100,000 francs dower. 100,000 francs? 100,000 francs. Which could raise up to... 120,000 francs. - 120,000 francs? - So? Of course! Should I set the table for two? Beef stew with carrots. Are you in? Maybe you'll have just the veggies. I can't refuse. It will be our first meal as a family. Exactly. "As a family"! Subtitles: ECLAIR MEDIA
