So where you from? - From back east, Boston. - I, I, I was born and raised here, but, but I've been to Boston, I mean it's a great town. - Really, were you there for business or for-- - Business, I am an artist. - Oh wow, what kind of art do you do? - I dunno, I guess you'd call it eclectic.

You live around here? - No, I just moved to town. - You know, if you need to know where the best rents are, I know 'em all. - Thanks, I just got a place. - Look, I'm outta here for the night, see you guys later. - See ya, girl. - Bye bye. - Bye. - Listen girl, you don't just wiggle your butt in here and steal a regular customer of mine, and I better never see you do it again. - Calm down, she didn't do it on purpose. - Oh bullshit, she knows exactly what she's doing. - Don't get your panties in a wad. - Bug off! And you little bitch, you best better not ever get in my way again. - Don't worry about it, she'll get over it. It wasn't your fault. - How do you know who's someone's regular? - To most of us it doesn't matter, but Kat, she's different. She'll get over it, don't worry about it. - Yeah. Thanks. - So, you here alone, or do you have family? - No, no family, just me. - It's my kid, he's three. - Oh, he's so adorable, what's his name? - Bobby. His father's name was, well, he was, drunk driver. - I'm sorry. - He was living with his father and um, we broke up about a year ago. Now after the accident, well, let's just say he's living with me now. - Well it must be nice to have him with you. - Yeah, it is, really nice. - Cherry, babe, come on, you're up. - It was really nice talking to you. - You too. (heavy breathing) Can I have a glass of water, please? - Sure. - Thanks. - You know, you were really great tonight. You're a natural, and that is as rare as a faithful guy. (laughing) Believe me. - Thank you. - In a week it'll be as routine as breathing. - I hope so. You know I was in the dressing room just now. I had the strangest feeling that somebody was watching me, I mean really watching me. - Honey, around here someone is always watching you. (laughs) - Okay, now I'm jumpy right now. You know, 'cause the murder and everything. You know, did you know the girl that got killed well? - Yeah, yeah. She was a, she was a nice kid. She kept to herself. Frankie and her were close. - I'm gonna put you on the regular schedule, say Wednesday through Sunday, unless you have any objection? - No, that's great, I really need the money. Well don't worry, you'll make good money here, and sometimes there's an occasional party where I send a girl or two. Great dough, no hanky panky. - Yeah, it sounds good. Do all of the girls do parties? - Only the best. - Really, I'm flattered. Have the girls worked here a long time? - Well a few have, but most come and go. Boyfriends, drugs. By the way you don't-- - No, no. No boyfriends, no drugs. - Good, you'll do fine. - Frankie? - Yeah? So how was your first night? - It wasn't bad, and mostly everyone seems really nice. - Good, yeah, we get a good crowd. Every once in a while you get a drunk or something, but do me a favor. Anybody ever bothers you or touches you in a way you don't like, you let me know, I make sure they never bother you again, huh, capeesh? - Thanks. - Forget about it. As long as I've been working here, they should know better. - How long have you been working here? - Oh for three years now. It's a good gig. We're like a friendly, dysfunctional family you know? - Yeah, I can tell. (laughs) So what do you do when you're not here? - What do I do, I work with my brother. He's a lawyer, you know, car accidents. By the way, if you ever get in one, or uh, you wanna, if you know what I mean. You give me a call, I'll make sure you get a quick coupla dollars. - Really? - Yeah, (chuckles) it's a piece of cake. I've made some of these girls so much money. - Okay Frankie, I'll keep that in mind. - Yeah, do. - Yeah, I'm tired, I'm gonna get out of here, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Hey uh. Nevermind, go ahead, get outta here. Good night. - [Jen] Good night.

Come on in. - Thanks. - So how did it go tonight? - Went okay, it was strange, but it went okay. - I want you to tell me everything you saw at the club tonight, don't leave anything out.

(dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - I think I should have got some more beauty sleep, I'm feeling really old. What do you think, do you think I need a lift?

How's that work? - Sometimes they contact Joe, they send a few of us over for a private dance at their place. The money's always good, like three or 400 plus tips. You go totally nude, it's 500 bucks. - That's great money. Has there been any of them lately? - Why, do you need to borrow some cash or something? I've got some put away-- - No, no, no, I don't need to borrow money, I'm just trying to figure out how these things work, you know? How about the regular customers, do you see any of them getting the private dances outside the club? - Sometimes a bachelor party or something. But why do they want to spend the bigger bucks when they can come in here and get their pants swollen for even cheaper. - Right. - Let's go there. - Seat over there. - Well, looks like it's time for luncheon with the lap droolers. - Hmm. Des, how you doing? - Actually, awful. I try so hard to stay in shape, but I never felt thin enough or pretty enough. - Oh honey, you're in great shape, and you are very, very beautiful. - There's something really different about you. I don't know what it is. - I'm just trying to pay the bills like everyone else. - Well I didn't mean it in a negative way or anything, it's just, you know you seem so together, so focused. - I'm just driven to accomplish something in my life right now. - Yeah, I can relate to that.

Oh, come on, I'm a gentleman. - Yeah, and I'm a stripper, Paul, who doesn't even know you. Come on, with everything that's going on you expect me to go to your house all alone? - Well technically you wouldn't be alone because I'd be there with you. - Very cute, but it's against the club's rules to date a customer. - Well this wouldn't be a date, I mean I'll pay for your services as a model. - Oh, how much? - I don't know, what's your rate? - Come on, I'm kidding.

I gotta get a different job. How you doing? - Uh, just what I told you on the phone. It was the same piece of paper that Misty had. And then he asked me to pose. - I told you finding a killer's always dangerous. What did you tell the police? - You know, just what you told me to say, that I saw her once and that's it. - I ran a background check on a few of the club's people. Joe, the owner, he's been arrested three times for assault, once with a stripper and twice by his ex-wife. Frank the doorman, assault with a deadly weapon, and Katlin Clark, Jesus. She's got a long rap sheet for drugs and prostitution. Interesting bunch, they should have a talk show. - What do you want me to do next? - First, are you sure you want to go through with this? - Yes. - Okay, you keep doing your job and I'll cover my end. What are you trying to do, get me to reduce my fees? - Of course. - Turn me around. Oh, Jen? I don't want you to trust anyone, okay? - [Jen] Okay. - You look like you need this. - No, no, don't say that. - It's a double. - [Jen] It's a double? - Double cola, mm. - [Jen] Better watch out. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just a little tired, that's all. - Yeah, well I guess we're all a little on edge. - Yeah, it's so horrible about Misty's death. She'd given me those flowers for good luck. - Yeah, well, try not to think about it, okay? They'll get the bastard that did this. - Well I know they will. - Hmm, ah, I want to go home and sleep for about a month. - Oh, me too. How long did they question you for? - About a half an hour. It was the same when it happened with Amy. These cops don't give a damn about strippers being murdered. - Yeah. - I try to forget there's so many sick bastards out there, and then this. We just got to be extra careful, you know? Really watch out for each other? - Yeah, we do. How's Bobby? - He's great, typical boy, into everything. It's funny, sometimes I watch him and wonder what he's gonna be like when he's all grown up, you know? - It all happens so quick. - Right, what about you? I mean I'm always running at the mouth about myself. What are your dreams, your fantasies? - God, I don't know. Maybe one of those tropical islands, you know, Tahiti, Bali, Hawaii, one of those. - Romance, white sandy beaches and golden sunsets. No leering men and loud music. - All it takes is money. - Money, the root of all evil and this source of all pleasure. Let's go make some. - No, you go ahead. - All right I'll see ya. - Okay. - It's a-- - [Man] Hey boss, I gotta talk to you. (knocking on door) - [Jen] John, it's me. - Come on in. - Hi. Look, I snuck into Joe's office, and I found out that Paul had both Amy and Misty over for private sessions. - And now he wants to give you private sessions. - Yeah, do you think he's the one? - He's on the list. Police work is like my wheelchair. Zen, it takes patience waiting for a flower open. You look tired. - Thanks. I am tired, my nerves are on edge. You know? - Yeah, why don't you go home and empty your mind, let me worry tonight. - Okay, bye. - Tomorrow's a new day. - Yeah.

I like your house, it's beautiful. - Thanks, it's really too big for just me. - My mother and father moved to Florida a few years ago and they didn't want to sell it so I moved back in. I grew up here. Here's my studio. - I'm impressed. - Thanks, would you like something to drink? - Yes, thank you. - She's very beautiful. - Yes, she is. I hope you enjoy classical music. - Yeah. (exotic rhythmic music) The girls from the club, are your friends with them? - I suppose. But you've gotta know that I like you more than just a friend. - So Paul, are you gonna paint me like you did them? - I don't think so. Do you mind? - No, I don't mind. You wanna paint me here, Paul? Or do you want to paint me there? (moans) (soft rock music) I have to get home. - No. - Yeah. - I'm worried about you. - No, I'll be fine. - I don't know, with what's going on at the club and everything I just don't know if it's a good idea that you-- I guess that'll teach me to open my mouth, huh? (crowd cheering) - Hey Lace. - Hi, how are you? - Good, how you doing? - I've been better. I just found out that the cops are thinking about shutting us down. - Why? - To protect us. - As if this nut's gonna stop if we close down? God the cops are so stupid. - Well I guess they're desperate enough to try just about anything at this point. - Desperate, they're not desperate, that's a joke. If Joe asks just tell him I'll be back in a while. - I've got some bad news. They found another body, same MO. I'm sorry, it was Cherry. - She was my friend. She had a little boy who was only three years old. - Look don't worry, it wasn't Paul. - You knew I saw him? - I had a friend of mine watching him. - Are you sure, John? - I contacted the criminal psychiatrist, he said this type kills with a trigger mechanism. I find that trigger, we've got the killer. (smooth jazz music) - I'm Shane, and what's your pleasure? - Something hot, baby. - Well that I'm your girl, 'cause the hotter it is, the better I like it. - Oh really, you got a limit? - Let's just say I'm very, very flexible. - Well, how much flexibility does 50 bucks buy me? - And you think that's gonna pay my bills. Well, a couple more of those and I'll be real hot. - First you steal customers, now what are you stealing? - Oh Jesus, what are you talking about? - I saw you go in Joe's office five minutes ago. - Katlin, I thought I left my purse in his office the other day when I was talking to him. - You're so full of shit. I knew there was something off about you from the start. I'm gonna see to it that you don't fuck with anyone anymore.

Get out of here, it's dead anyway. - Thanks. - Okay. - Did you find anything out from the files? - Hm? Oh no, nothing. Did Amy ever say who she was dating? - No, why? - The coroner's report came in and she was 2 1/2 months pregnant. - She never said anything to me. - Someone at the club knows. - Lacy said that she was seeing Frankie. - I think we're getting close to that trigger, Jen. Are you gonna be all right? - Yeah. I better get back. - Keep it together. (heavy breathing) - Hey. - Hey honey, were have you been? - I had to go home for awhile. - Did you forget something, I always do. - No, no, I had to go check on my daughter. - You have a daughter?

What's her name? - Amanda. - And where's the father? - He split, Katlin, because I was pregnant. - Well that figures, nothing scares a man more than responsibility. - Do you have a picture of her? - Um, not with me, but I'll bring some in to show you guys. - Does she look like you? - No, she looks like her dad. She has those really, really blue eyes, and oh, she's really precious. - Well I can't wait to meet her, but right now I got to go do a dance with Des. - Amanda, that's a nice name. - Uh, did you know that Jen has a five year old? - No. - Just thought you should know. - Thanks.

I think you need to get to know me a little better, maybe dinner one night when you're off, I could meet your little girl. - Sure. - [Joe] How old is she? - She two, her name's Amanda. - Amanda, that's a pretty name. Lacy, a drink to toast Jen and Amanda. - You got it. - Look Jen, if you need to work a little extra, you just come in, okay? I know babies need a lot of care. - Thank you, I appreciate that. - Here we go. - Well, to Jen and Amanda, health and happiness always. - Bottoms up. - There's a friend of mine, excuse me. - Does Joe date a lot of the girls? - A few. - How about that girl, what's her name, Amy? - I think so, why? - No, I was just thinking, because I know that she and I look alike, maybe he likes my type. - He likes all types. - I don't believe it, a baby girl and you didn't even tell us? You know we're all gonna have to get together and throw a little party for you and your daughter. I can't wait to meet her. - No, no, no, you don't have to throw us a party. - Nonsense, it'll be fun, and you know we could all use a little fun around here. I'll plan it for one afternoon next week, it'll be great. - Okay. - Okay, great, I'll see you later. (suspenseful music) - Here, Joe just gave me this for you. It's a private with his best customer. - Oh, it's for tonight. - Yeah, Joe knows that you could use the extra money. He probably set it up special. - Oh, well that's nice of him. - Do you know this guy? - Sure, he doesn't come in here much, but when he does, he tips big. - John, look it's me. I got a private dance outside the club. Yeah, look I told everyone I had a daughter. - Why? - Because I think that might be the connection, I think that's the trigger. Look, they all had or they were having kids, they were mothers. - What are you supposed to do, and when? - Oh, it's 52 48 Langmore number nine, I gotta be there in one hour. - You don't move until I call you back, understand? - Yeah, I understand, I'll be here. - [Jen] Lace? - Yeah, you want a drink? - No no, I've got to talk to you. - Well you know I'm a professional listener, shoot. - It's kind of a long story, do you remember Amy, the dancer? - Yeah. - Amy's my sister. I came here with a private investigator to find her killer. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not kidding. Lacy, Joe's the killer. - No, what makes you think that? - Because he's the only key to this murder, he was the one that gave him the private dances the night before they were murdered. Joe's the only link to these murders, Lacy. - So what are you gonna do now? - Wait for my friend to call, and then go. - And trap him? - Yeah. - You've got courage. - Actually I'm scared to death. - I um, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you. I was jealous. Stupid. - No, forget about it. - I just hope that we can be friends from now on. - Yeah, of course we can. Of course. - So what are you going to Lacy's? - What do you mean? - Lacy's? This is her address. All right what's going on here? - It's Lacy. - What? - Get out, Katlin. - [Katlin] What? - Get out of here, Katlin, get out! (phone rings) - Hello? (gasps) (crying) (choking) - Lacy? Lacy. It's all right, your mother's gone. It's true, there's no more pain. Not for you, and not for your sister. Your mother is gone. Your mother is gone. I'm working with John, are you all right, darling? All right, come on, come on. (glass shatters) (Harry yells) (Lacy grunts) (Jen breathes heavily) - Take it off. Take it off, now. (Lacy yells) - When I didn't get a call back from John, and I saw you were still in the club, I figured I'd better stay. - Lacy's sister lived with her for years, she's been in a coma. - And as a form of punishment, her mother used to suffocate them when they were bad, and one day she went too far. - Lacy's mother was a stripper, so every time she killed she was killing her mother. But Lacy seemed so normal. - Well this Lacy, she was normal. But, well, she created a male persona to do the killing for her. - That's right. The chemicals we found under the victim's fingernails matched the hand lotion Lacey was using. So we checked into her background and that's when we found out about her sister, and her condition. - And that was the trigger. - Well what's gonna be done with the sister? - She'll be put in a home where they can care for victims like her. - That so many died because of one mother's abuse. - Well, John, I think we oughta leave these two young people alone. Let's take a walk. Sorry. - Push, you know I could replace you with a motor. You two stay in touch with us. - Okay. - Oh, hold on. This is for you. - Thanks, John. Thanks, Harry. - Bye bye, darlin'. - Bye bye. - They're great guys. - Yeah, you're pretty great yourself. - I really care about you, and I just, just wonder. - What? - If you'll ever do a private dance for me again.
