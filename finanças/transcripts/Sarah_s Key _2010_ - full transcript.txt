Vichy was the first marshal Ptain offered peace in 1942. "France's agrees, let us not fail," said the head of state. And so it was. Her name was Sarah. Stop, Sarah Stop. I'm gonna get you. Daddy? Where are you going? - Stay here. Open up, it's the police. My husband is not home. - Police. Open up. Open up, ma'am. We will kick the door in. July 16, 1942 Mrs. Starzinski? - I do not know where my husband is. Come with us. Take enough things for three days. Where are we going? - Bring blankets, food... and your paperwork. Can my doll come along? - Only the most necessary. Wait... Michel... is that your son? - Yes. But the children too? Where is he? He's not home. Take me with you, and not the children. Please. I beg you! What is it? You must hide. - I do not want to. Like yesterday, as a game. - Okay. Go ahead. Where are your son and your husband? Cooperate. I really do not know. You stay right here. You promise? I will come back later. I swear that I do not know. I do not know. - They are out of town. My brother was sick. Fresh air is good, "Papa said. Give me the keys to your house. Do you know where the man and the boy are? - The man I have not seen for a while. And the boy... I saw him recently. Maybe he's in the basement. Look in there. The baby can not sleep from the heat. The basement is the coolest place to sleep. May I go now? - We'll be back. But when you see them... Daddy. Do not cry, girl. Do not cry. Sarah, are you there? Paris 2009 It smells mame. The first time she stood there. I wanted to prove... that "early American"... deserved his little-loved son. Mom, she is still alive. Brand new. We can so. If you want an open kitchen, we get away this wall. Is it not a bearing wall? - Then we place a lintel. Ready. You are the architect. So, should you be interested: This is your room. Oh yeah? How many square feet? - Not much. But this wall is going away. Then you have two windows. Is that right, princess? Have you heard the story of this apartment? Previously hired my grandparents, only this part. In the 50s they could buy it and later merge with these houses. The Marais was a popular neighborhood. Here my father slept at your age. So your grandfather. Hewas also a child. Some people keep their lives private. That is our rich competitors. And it is us. Nothing to be convulsed with laughter. - Times are tough. - That's why... we will imagine an ideal society... a utopia for the 21st century. An article on cosmetic surgery? The naked woman can boost sales. Let us focus on... what the future holds good. Biotechnology, space race. - Positive thinking. - From an old pessimist. As you see. People need to breathe. I'm not that old. Then the Middle East for Obama. I leave that to the London office. What else? Ah yes... The daughter of deported... ...against the state and the SNCF. She won? Yes. Chirac's speech at the Vel d'Hiv... - Has borne fruit. - On what? Het Vel d'Hiv. How do you spell that? - You're kidding. - What happened? In July 1942... 16 and July 17, 1942... 13,000 Jews were arrested. Especially women and children. 8000 have been parked in the Velodrome. A horror. The Superdome in New Orleans... - A thousand times worse. - At least. Afterwards, they were sent in the camps. You're well informed. Time Magazine... I was entitled to half a sheet. So now I want 10 pages. Ten? I can not, Julia. Our readers love the story. Most are unaware of this history. Young apologize. So an old indoor velodrome? Very beautiful. Where is it? - Shaved 50 years ago. - Photos? Not precisely. 10,000 people crammed... no bed, no toilets and little water. - And not an image. - There is one. Buses in front of the entrance. That's it. It's weird. The Nazis filmed everything. It is well known. Mike... There were the French. I do not understand. Why is he still inside? He is safe. - In the closet? It happened so fast. We must go get back, he is still there. - You do not understand. It's your own fault, big nose. Shut up, crazy woman. Soon we return. No, old fart, we are French. Come on. I repeat: It is forbidden to run on the track. Children, do not play on the track Dad, I need the toilet. Do you know where the toilets are? The toilets? - They are already clogged. And can we get water? It's suffocating in here. Sir? My mother, brother and I wanted to go to free South. Just when the suitcases were packed, the police came. I guess my mother and brother escaped. I have to save myself. Had you had not heard the rumors? - Yes. We heard rumors all week, every day. But they take only men. The kids do not go to camps? This is crazy... I must get out? Mom, we need to go get Michael. - He should have come. Let me through. Calm down, ma'am. Think only of your family, and yourself. There are men who help some escape. - I have not given it any thought. One officer said this morning that I had to take the bus left. The other goes to Drancy camp. - It never works. To try to escape. How? Please let my brother out. Stop. We never should have come here. Give it here. My name is Anna. Sister. What is it, ma'am? I'm coughing up blood. Is it serious? There are very few doctors. Come on. I will take care of you. Wait. I need to talk to her. My son is locked up at home. Calm down and go back. Please go pick up my son. 36 rue de Saintonge, three high. See? Why have you not given the key to her? Why do you have him locked up? You know what you did? You realize that? You realize that? A street like others. No trace of the past. There is a plaque, bld. Grenelle... and a statue quai de Grenelle. But the entrance to the Vel d'Hiv was good here? Ministry of Interior I never want to talk about. - I understand. The entrance to the cycling stadium right opposite. You heard everything. After two days we had the windows shut day and night. Due to the noise? The stench. You get the idea. Neighbors tried to figure out what was happening? To understand? Understand? Later it was easier. There were so many stories about Jews around. What could we do? Call the police? Rivka Starzinski. Vladislav Starzinski. Sarah Starzinski. Wake up. Come on. We go. Are we going home? Mom, I do not feel good. Got a headache? My god, where are we going? To Pitchipoi, they say. - No, to Beaune-la-Rolande. From camp Pithiviers you seem to be released. Believe what you want, but I think we go to Germany or Poland. Wherever we go, it's like where we come from. You see this ring? There's poison in it. No one determines when to die. Nobody. Good Day, Mrs. Tzac. Not "Mrs. Tzac. She calls herself rather Jarmond. That's her maiden name. Ms. Jarmond. She loves her American name. An American habit. Ms. Jarmond s American. - You are in a good mood. Anyway, I am Mrs Tzac. Good day, ladies. - I will get this for you How thoughtful of you. How's that loser of a husband of yours? I never see him. He's busy. But he thinks a lot to you Yes, yes... How are you? You look tired. Do you? No, I'm fine. I just had a tough interview. And the apartment? - We were there the day before yesterday. You do not demolish the lot? Be aware... that we have lived there for over sixty years. A whole human life. Sixty years? Yes, sixty years. But at the outset, In the war you thought: Something is better than nothing. You lived there since the war? - Yes, in August '42. What a misery. We were first with his Driene in my room... above the shop in the rue de Turenne. Edouard was nine. When our friend said that a nearby two-room house was vacant... Why was that released? - Baby... I know not. Will you give me a glass of water? What is it? You look so pale. I stood up too fast. I'm dizzy. Say, you're not pregnant? You know how hard I tried to get pregnant. So in this age... I feel such a thing. You're pregnant. Hi, it's me. - Are you home? No, in the house in the Marais. - Will you work? How can that be? - There is none. Did you know that your grandparents lived here since the war? Yes. Why? Just like that. Tell me later. Dear Bertrand, do you want me tonight as a dinner treat? Most willingly. Would arrange it in nine hours? Fine. Transit camp of Beau e-la-Rolande July 1942 Men left, women and children right. Please, sir... - Keep moving. Is there a doctor? My daughter is sick. - No, continue. My daughter has a fever. Who can help? Please? Is there a doctor? Mom? How long are we here? - I do not know, Sarah. And Dad? When will we see him again? Soon, dear. Soon. Sorry it is not easy with the Chinese contract. - Are they signed? Not yet. I get no kiss? - Of course. Do you want a drink? - No, I'm fine. What is going on here? - This is our table. My god. - What? Nothing. I thought for a moment I forgot our anniversary. Why are you so tense? Relax. Too much stress. You have to scare me, Julia. You want to take off? - I expect news from the Chinese. Bertrand... I have great news. I was expecting a little more enthusiasm. I do not want to be an old father. - Since when do you consider yourself old? Yes, I am getting old. Faster than you. It is risky for the child. Ok... Our life has changed, So I will listen adolescence. The new house, I've worked hard. Time to slow down. If that's your answer, I take a taxi. Should I, after all IVF treatments and two miscarriages... Abort this child? I've had six years of peace. The doctors had a miracle happen. Is it no wonder then? Hurry. We have to go get Michael. I promised. Small children right, large left with their mother. Back to your mother. Listen. Women and children over twelve... leave the camp first. Younger children join their families in one week. The men have left. They will see you again soon. Cooperate and you'll be fine. Back the hell up. I love you with all my heart. May God protect you. Some of the 11,000 children deported from the Vel d'Hiv. With my work I read the figures and statistics... a face to all those individuals, their tangible existence. Gruesome. In every picture I think of my own daughter. Unfortunately, those who studied here, do not remain unscathed. Is that true for you? This work is undoubtedly necessary and cathartic. Sorry, forgot to turn it off. My father. - Take, if it is important. Later I'll call back. Okay, ma'am? When many Jews lived in the Marais? Yes, it was a Jewish neighborhood, like Belleville. - Why? No, just... My husband and I are moving into an apartment soon... that his family owns in the rue de Saintonge. I just found out they were moved in August 1942. They are decent people. It must be coincidence. Would you like me to figure it out? Everything is on the computer. During the war the people needed to survive. To my mind... What number in the rue de Saintonge? - 36. Three families were living there. Which floor? That song my mother sang to me when I was sick and could not sleep. You have slept for three days and talked. You mentioned a key and Michel. I did not get it. Looking for this? I must find my brother. Come on. Want to escape? - I saw a woman who did it. When it is light is easier. Careful, you are still sick. Escape never works. There are no more grownups. What happened? - Do not you remember? Yes. Here, take this. What the hell? Where the women gave us food, There is a hole in the barbed wire. Would you like to escape? - No, at night it is too quiet. They spotlight. During the day it is easier... that noise and crying children. If it is just as warm tomorrow... The gendarmes will seek the shade. We need to sweaters to find out. That we attract each other. - It's been so hot. Then we do not hurt the wire. I think your brother has done the same thing as us. He has certainly escaped. - I'm sure not. Why? - Because he had to promise me. Come quickly. Where you going? - Get away, you. Let me go. My brother is alone in Paris. I got it locked up when we were arrested. He's waiting for me. - It is too late. It is no different. You must stay here. Escape is forbidden. - Jacques... How do you know my name? - I picked it up. And that apple, I will never forget. My name is Sarah, Sarah Starzinski. Quickly then. Get out. Okay? What it smells nice. We must get rid of these stars. Look at that. Come on. Look, a village. - I do not feel good. Come quick. Come on. - I feel really sick. Maybe we can ride. What are you doing? I'm not going to make it. There is light. Jules. Look. Nothing but water. She is sick. Get away. We do not want problems. Get out, I said. Some watchdog? It is not dangerous to your age? I will do an amniocentesis. You can have a miscarriage. Or be mowed down by a bus. Why are you doing this? You have suffered enough. Because I feel it. And if Bertrand supports me, that's okay. Yes, if you support... It does not tell him anything, dirty diapers... and sleepless nights. You're too old. Thank you. It helps a lot. Then this story apartment? They have stolen? No, like the Marais... the Lower East Side. Jewish immigrants were renting. Bertrand thinks what? I have not had the courage to tell him. You are New Yorker and a fighter. 25 years in France will not change anything. Do what you gotta do. Easy to say. Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski. Executed at Auschwitz in 1942. Not Sarah or Michael... on any list of prisoners... Poland or Drancy. They had to flee. You're a stubborn. You would not do? They can be anywhere. They may be alive. You want them to make room? Why not? Do not wake the sleeping cat. My stepfather. I'm sure they knew it. They told you that? I do not know how to ask them. It's very simple: Call them and ask them. You are quiet this morning. As we sat inside. - She's sick. Should the doctor come? - Doctor Thvenin is on holiday. His replacement is close with the Germans. We wait a moment. But I have to go to Paris. - How so? He'll probably have escaped, baby. No, he would wait. I have to go there. Those I will burn. That's smarter. You get clothes from Nicolas. - Who is that? My grandson. He is of your age. With your hair under a cap you're just a boy. And Paris? What would you think of warm milk and some sandwiches? What's your name, baby? Michle. He's waiting for me. Go ahead, Michl. Just relax. She is really sick. - Then they go to the doctor. Now she sleeps. We wait. Help. Give me the sheet. The doctor should be here. She's dieing. Lieutenant, the child is sick. Better if she dies. But she is Jewish, huh? - Little did I know. I could not... Leave her beside the road. Two children escaped. Have you seen the other one? No, only this girl. You know that you are playing with fire if you hide that child. Then we do not let the doctor come? Look around if you think we lie. Do you think we are that stupid? Go ahead, have a look. Waste of time. She's dead. Diphtheria. I could not do anything. I put her in the car. Come tomorrow and make a statement at the Kommandantur, sir Dufaure. It will go now. Heil Hitler. Get the other girl. One dead child is enough. My real name is Sarah. Sarah Starzinski. Edouard, the wrong day? - Bye, honey. That's what I said yesterday al Normally he should be. I'm not the only one who gets confused. You never reacts, Julia. I have three times left a message. Sorry, it was very busy. But I just wanted to call back. Why do I run away? I know your mom and questions about Bertrand 's apartment. Let's go outside. - What do you carry in your pocket? Please? We getsome fresh air. We will be back. In my car we can talk quietly. Here. You do not worry, boy. You will also soon be a proud soldier? Allow me, madam. - It's a nice kid. You do not have much luggage. You are clearly not in the black market. Identity Papers. Excuse me. And the boy? - The bottom of the envelope. Problems? No, it's okay. Bertrand I have spoken. He said you write an article about... About the raid. Where is your interest in the apartment? I thought she was bedridden. You think someone is good to know... Not so suspicious, say. And please do not interfere with things that do not pertain to you Does the name Starzinski mean anything to you? The family had nothing to do with their arrest. Are you sure? Yes, but only my father and I were informed. What do you mean? They must not know. Clear? She was not home that day. What day? The day the girl came back. I opened the door. Stop, you do not know who you will find. I see you above. All the houses are already full. Look across the street. We need to see three high. To Tzac? Michel? Who's there? Wait, Sarah. Where is my brother Michael? Your brother? Daddy? What is that noise? I'm so sorry. My father would take care of everything. But I believe that the couple took the body. I do not remember. And Mom? - She was in the shop. She could not know. That you had not noticed... When we moved into the house, it smelled awful. In the kitchen was a dead cat. There were only a few pieces of furniture, there had been looting. It was wartime. We had cleaned everything. But the smell lingered. My father thought that a dead bird was lying in the gutter. We did close the window, but... It only got worse. We could not find key of the closet and did not force the door. And when the girl arrived... on the afternoon of the second day. How is Sarah, did she also perish? Until his death, my father never mentioned her name. She was part of the secret. When I asked him how she was... He said to keep my mouth shut. Do you know? Do you know where she is? I do not know. But I do know that they were not deported. When my father passed away... I heard from the notary about some personal documents. They are located at the bank. I never dared to look. I would like to see them? Is anyone? What do you think? Nice. - Yeah, huh? Only I do not know whether I can live here soon. There is nothing I can imagine. It's perfect for three of us. Three of us? - Yes. Come... Not too much. Why did you not tell me the truth? - How so? So. Sorry. Do not you feel that it is wrong? What is it? - You're so bland. But you want me to have an abortion. You have not one once asked what the doctor said. It leaves you cold. What you've already created: You go to China. We talked about it. It is better. We get a new life. Yes, about one week sign you a mega contract. The next 150 years no money worries. A great daughter, 'n beautiful apartment of arrested Jews. Never mind. - What did you say? Nothing. I have a long day behind me. I'm going home. Julia, what did you just say? - I had to keep my mouth shut. Ask your father. What did you think? - I heard it today, just like you. Why did you manage it like you did? To protect you. I think... Did you tell your sisters? - How can I keep it to myself? For Mom. Who has lived there all her life. Your wife. Do you know where Bertrand? - He's here. I regret enormously. So he will not talk to me. - He's old enough. Why are you calling him? It's late. - It was your father. How could he do it. Thank you. - My pleasure. Good night. Sir. I would like to thank on behalf of Sarah. We still have the 100 francs you send each month for her even if you did not think she knew. Hopefully you will understand. Last week we harvested the wheat. However serious, Sarah did her share. She never complains. I saw the last two times you sent 120 francs. Now that the war is over, we can buy her beautiful clothes. I enclose a photograph of her with my grandsons Nicolas and Edgar. Beautiful girl, right? Sarah. Be careful that you do not catch cold. Do not worry. What are you doing? Sir. Sarah is doing well. We went to the beaches in Normandy For the first time she has seen the sea. She's grown up. Her character is changing. She is quiet but reckless. Other shores attract her. These dark days are a stain on our history. 74 trains... going to Auschwitz. 76,000 French Jews deported... never returned. The insane, criminal policies of the occupying forces... was, as we all know... actively supported by residents of France, the French state. We will put the video online. Nice speech, that person will return. His words made noise at the time. Your article is amazing, Julia. Say that it happened right in Paris. It is to vomit. What would you have done? How? How do you know... what you have done? I watched it on TV... as civilian casualties in Iraq. Please, Mike. Oh, thank you for calling back. I am looking for Edgar Nicolas or Dufaure. Or family. - What it makes? - No idea. Or distant relatives? Thanks for calling back, ma'am. Mom? Who's that? I try to find it. I'll tell you. You'd think if it was serious? Of course, my angel. Do not worry. Good morning, Mme Tzac. You should take this pill. Are you sober? Fine. I'll be back. Oh, you did not fill in "Contact. Is that mandatory? - Yes, we need a name. Sorry. Sorry. Julia is with me. I wish I could be with you. Thinking of you. I hope it went well. I am very aware that we are currently... going through a difficult phase. But it will be over. I love you. Kiss's. I found your message last night. I'm Nathalie Dufaure. My father was Nicolas Dufaure. I do not know what you're looking for. But you can reach me at this number. Happy days. An abortion? - Yes, but they did not seem sure. I have two hours with you. - What is this, Mrs. Tzac? Yes, for the church. If I can not find it, I call u. Thanks. See you later. You may have to lie down to think. I have thought enough. This is a waste of your time. I regret enormously. Goodbye. You see, this could not miss. Nathalie. Can I leave the car here? Shall we? When my grandfather heard that you wanted to talk about Sarah, he began to shine. He thought you had news about her, or maybe her daughter. He has not heard from her in over fifty years forgive me i love you It was in May 1953. She left without giving an address. My grandfather had it the worst with it. But he did not blame her. That's what he told me on his deathbed. He knew it would happen. She has never given a life farming? Any idea where they can be? This is the only life farming, in 1955. Just to let you know that it went well with her, without further explanation. Can I? - Of course. Sarah and Richard Rain Ferd... Brooklyn. She went to America. You're there. I tried to join you. I cut my phone. - I'm glad to see you. - Me too. Bertrand phoned. He is worried. What is it? You did? You have to talk to him. We miss them too. - I should come more often. - Yes. So you found? An idiot would have found on the Internet. There are five Rainsferd in Brooklyn. To you find the right one. What are you gonna find? I do not know. Someone. I am looking for Sarah or Richard Rainsferd. Not know. Thank you. I am looking for Richard and Sarah Rainsferd. No Richard or Sarah here. And in your family? No, I'm sorry. Sorry, you are Richard Rainsferd? Bob Rainsferd. Do you know Sarah or Richard? No, sorry. Thank you. Now, we'll... You want? I am looking for Ms. Rainsferd, but... My mother is out. You're a friend? No, I know people his family. - In Europe? - Yes, Europe. You live in Manhattan? In Paris. But I grew up here. Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. - Your mother said that? - She speaks of Rome. Excuse me. We'll be there all day. The nurse from my father. It will not be long. Is he ill? Sorry. Mom is very strong. She cheers up everyone. It's her. I'll help. That was in 1966. Surely a tire that exploded. The truck driver said she swerved... and he could not avoid it. I met Richard two years later. At first he did not remarry. It was as if... he wanted to be the husband of Sarah. But years have passed... and he eventually changed his mind. And that's it. Their son lives in Italy. A son? William, my half-brother. He was nine years... when Sarah had her accident. Then, it was difficult. But I like high my own son. I taught him to love Italy... to eat pasta. And he met a woman... the village where I was born. He never returned. He lives in Florence now. It did him good from here... and rebuild his life in Europe. It is the nurse. I go there. Can I see your husband? I do not know if it a good idea... to revisit all those things. He is very ill. I understand. And his son? Mom, answer me. You have a lover? Of course not. But you'll leave Dad. I never said that. He told you that? No, but why... you're gone suddenly Florence? My darling... It's much more complicated. I go tomorrow... and we'll talk. And the baby... You should have told me. That concerns me too. I know, I'm sorry. - You do not want this baby? - I say that. I wish I had a little brother. Or sister. But I will not change its layers. I love you, choupinette. Are you Julia? I did not know you spoke French. As a child I spoke French with my mother. But I think what my French... rusty? What do you drink? Water, it will be perfect. You want dinner? Just drink something. Water and a glass of Brunello. You are a journalist. I investigated. And write on Tuscan cuisine. My book is responsible for... those extra pounds that I can not lose. What can I do for you? You're too young... to have known my mother. I am family T?zac. - Who? - The T?zac. Sorry, I do not say anything. They have taken... Apartment rue de Saintonge... after the family Your mother... My stepfather, Edward T?zac was there... when they found your uncle Michael. I have no uncle. The brother of your mother. She had no brother. Rue de Saintonge tells me nothing. Maybe you the wrong person. Your mother's name Sarah? Yes, Sarah Rainsferd. And before that Sarah Dufaure. And Starzynski, it means nothing to you? Starzynski? No. You made this trip for nothing. Sorry. There must be another Sarah. What did you tell the son of... You recognize? It is impossible. Not... There is a little resemblance, but... This is not my mother. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. My mother was not... Jewish. You want what? You came to say... that my mother had another name? She was a victim of this tragedy? Sorry. I'm Did you know. It's madness. My mother was French. Sarah Dufaure. She had no brother. She never lived in Paris. - You're wrong. - Let me... tell you everything. No, I do not know. This is important. Let me be clear. I do not want to talk about that. And I do not want to see you again. Please do not call me. Enjoy your stay in Florence. Ridiculous to just disappear. New York, Italy... What did you find with this guy? By now you know the whole family. Even mom, the poor man is 95. Suddenly so concerned about Mom? - Stop it. The family's honor is saved anyway? You can start at the apartment to live. But do not count on me. We're going to sell it. Everyone is finished. Family decision. There goes my childhood. I wanted to know the truth. - The truth? Typically for journalists: The truth. And what brings us this beautiful truth? We are happy, happy guy. Everybody happy now the truth is known. The truth is often a high price. Ok. And now? I do not know. But everything in me wants to keep this child. Can you understand that everything in the child does not want me? Yes, I understand. We always wanted to have a second child. - Hello, Dad. - William... You should not be with your family? No, my place is here. You saw this reporter, right? One that tells the story silly. Sit down, William. - I'll help you. - Sit down. You mean all this is true? Yes? I remember... the first time I saw your mother. It was in a dance hall in Manhattan. I noticed two things. The first... It was the most beautiful woman... I had never seen. The second... Behind his smile... she seemed to hide something. We spent a good time. But I guess... she felt uncomfortable. It was the saddest person... I had never met. I tried to erase this sadness. But it was impossible. It was not an accident. His accident... was not an accident. You mean she killed herself? - Papa! - Listen... She was increasingly depressed. All drugs, alcohol... As if she had a shadow in her... who never stopped growing. You want some? - You do not say anything? - No. Continues. We had terrible fights... about your identity. What you had... or ought not to know. It was agreed on anything. She had taken precautions. Just after you were born... she left the hospital... for you to be baptized at the church. I left work for the ceremony. For her, if you were Jewish... your life was in danger. It's... irrational, of course... Everything is there. What's this? We never talked about... but she wanted this. Why do not you tell me? Why you waited... I have fifty? I had no strength. My whole life is a lie. William, my boy... You are what happened to me better. We are all products of our history. Yours is in these pages. Go, my son. Do not be afraid. What is it? Can you see me like this? - Yes. And you? Two years later I see nothing. I do not understand. I hear you, but you do not see. This does work? - Yes, because I can see you, Dad. You've done something wrong. Let's see, you know... Yes, now I see you. Is your gothic look over? Young men prefer to see me? What will your mother think? - Keep her out. Is the little girl around? - Yes, I will get her. Who's that behind you? Way, the camera films. But who is it? - A friend. Youth is not sexually transmitted, though. Very funny. Say, are you doing well in school? I mean better. - Dad, I want to go back to Paris. I miss you. I amtired of this country No, dear. That's because you're 14. Is your mom home? - Why? There is a call from an American, seeking his mother's past. William? Julia? Sorry. Even in France, we shake hands. - What's your name, princess? - Lucy. Nice to meet you, Lucy. It's a tourist trap. But I had often here with my mother. The sight fascinated her. So... You live here long? About a year. You are left? Sorry, I did not want to be indiscreet. - You've chosen? - A hot chocolate. The Dufaure have kept everything. It's incredible. They have been so happy... ...meet you. Was mutual. I realized with these books... I did not know my mother. I knew his face... ...her smile, her perfume. But I knew nothing of her. His doubts, his fears, his dreams. And here I am: 40 years later... trying to make his acquaintance. Thank you for coming. After Italy, I was very depressed. It was a selfish... pry into the lives of others... to stir memories... and even judge people. By what right? So: Thank you. No, I thank you. Thanks to you, my father died in peace. - And now? - I do not know. Weird, I needed to come back. But I feel like a stranger. France influenced me the most I thought. Perhaps I will return to Paris. My eldest daughter does not like it here. And I want the little... way his father when he sees fit. She is adorable, your little Lucy. Lucy is the name of the giraffe. Her name then how? Sarah. Excuse me. It is I who am sorry. Thank you.
