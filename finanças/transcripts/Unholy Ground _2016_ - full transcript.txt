Sweden, 1789 - during the Russo-Swedish War Help! We need help! Lieutenant Blomqvist, Commander of the 12th company. We have a wounded soldier and need your help. The man is dying, don't you see that?! Please! Help him. Lay him on the cart. We bring him to the village. Is there a doctor? Yes, we have a doctor. Run and inform Goran. - All right. Come with us now. Thanks. Many thanks. Someone came. That cannot be true... What's the point? Let us through. Don't you see, that he is wounded? What kind of people is there? What do they want here? Merit and the others from the field brought him here. Is Goran informed? One was sent to get him. What is all this? Let us through. Please! No, you cannot do this, Barbro! He is badly wounded! Goran should have a look at him! You know, that this is not possible. - Oh please be reasonable! Bring him in here. I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Pitch in, go ahead! What's happening here? - Just see for yourself... My God, he will bleed out! Where is the doctor now? - He is on his way. What you are doing here, that simply doesn't work. You cannot come in here and... - Where is he? Are you the doctor? What happened to him? We were in a battle. He was shot. - I see that. Can you staunch the bleeding? Do what you can please. He is a good soldier. Who is that? My God, I knew it... Jorunn! Get out of here! I knew, that you would come here. I knew it. What did you know? Why? Come, get out of here. They have enough to do here. Come on! How long is it back? What? - When was he shot at? This morning. We have to prevent, that the blood will bottle. Please prepare everything for a venesection. Venesection? Are you serious? That doesn't seem to be the right thing to me, doctor. Let that be my problem, all right? Venesection is a long-outdated method. It is hardly used anymore. Less than ever in these cases. If you are doubting my method, you can save him yourself. We are not in the Middle Ages anymore. - Venesection is still the effective treatment for almost every disease. He doesn't have a disease? he has a bullet in his ventral! Does he want to kill him?! If he doesn't do anything, he will die anyways. So let him do it. What's happening here? Who can tell me that? I have seen them. They are five. I have seen, that they would come. They cannot stay here. - They have wounded people with them. Thereupon I cannot consider that. You have to understand that. We cannot let him die. You don't understand. They should not be here. What should that mean? No! She is right. She is always right. What, if she... It should not begin all over again. It already has begun. It will happen again. God, Christ Almighty, help us! I cannot do this. I cannot stand this anymore. - Brother Jaro, what are you talking about? Nothing will happen! Did you understand?! My work is done. How is he? He is still alive. We don't know more at the moment. I think your commander needs rest. Come with us. We will see, where we can accommodate you. I will stay with Christer. In case he wakes up, he should see a familiar face. What happened to your company? - We fell into a battle in the forest near your village. A battle? Here? In this region a battle never happened. Obviously the Russian troops were already on their way back to the Finnish border, as we came into conflict. The Russ is a pig. He assaulted us in a flash in the early morning hours. An ambush! We didn't have a chance to stand upon their defense. We are the only survivors of the 12th company. May God mercy the souls of our fallen comrades. This horrible war against Russia has held so many victims... You are telling me... Most men of our village also fell in this war. Look around: there are almost only women here and old men. And men in the service of God. And men that went into war and never came back. Left behind many widows. Yes, I saw many comrades fall. I don't even want to think about their families. I even don't want to think about my own family and how the currently feel. Faith is a powerful ally in times of war. Stronger than any weapon. On the battle field faith is more useless. However yet the musket is. Trust hereon, that God fights on your side, Lieutenant. Trust in it. Withal it is for most of them already too late, monk. Be careful with your words! We are a godly community? you have to respect that! You are only here as a guest. Please show some respect towards the people that still understand living after God's commandments! Many things here seem more than odd to me. Don't you think so? Say that out loud. Look around: this village seems to be fallen totally out of time. As we have travelled back in time. I beg the lord, our God, of mercy, because I have sinned. Talk, my child: what sin have you done? I have spoken bad about a woman in our village. I hope God may forgive me from her position. - Keep talking. I allowed impure thoughts. I tried to abandon them, but they again plague home. - Are you talking about a person? - No particular person. No one whom I would know. - There is only one you should love: the Lord Jesus Christ. Only him you should love. Therefore please do not be foolish: despise your impure thoughts and turn to prayer. I am trying it, Brother Rasmus. I try it. Good my child. So he will forgive you your sins. So I am absolving you, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our village in any regard is independent. Independent from other people and other municipalities. - Like you see, we supply ourselves. Animal breeding, grain growing. Everything. As I have seen, you are even planting corn around the village. Yes, the climate here in this region is for Swedish circumstances unusual really mild. - It is because of the soil? it radiates a particularly strong heat. Probably not a bad place to live. - Don't be wrong of that. I will see where I can accommodate you. We are very thankful to you, that you are helping us. Better do not thank us. None of us wants to have you here. But the Lord Jesus has taught us to help the nearest? who would have a choice? Tell me: What is the situation at the front? You are coming from the front in Finland, right? Good wife, the war has long since arrived in Sweden. We came in to battles not far from here. - My husband is also in war. I haven't received any message anymore. Since more than a year. They say, he has fallen. But I don't believe that. Where do you want to go? - I only want to look around a little bit. I would not, in your position, raise too much hope. The Swedish army had to suffer huge losses. I am confident, that he is still alive. Where do you take this confidence from? - I just know it. Go back to work, kids. Come on. You are missing a leading hand. It will all be different, when he is back again. Father is not coming back. Everyone knows it. Shut your mouth! You will never say something like that again! Do you understand!? Yes, mother. I will never talk like this about father. Never again. She did not mean it that way. It will be like in the past again. Everything. Why did you do that?! You crazy woman! Tell me! She cannot answer you, can't you see that? Why? Is she dumb? Yes, she is. Why did she do that? She has obviously seen a threat in you. As you in the meanwhile have noticed, only rarely strangers come here. A nun. And various monks. Was there a monastery nearby? Yes, long time ago. A monistic order, which I also was part of and a nun monastery. Both at that time were almost totally eradicated by the plague. The few survivors found refuge in the village. So as well Sister Liska. She was very young. Even then she has not spoken? not a word. Therefore, we suspect that she was already born dumb. Poor kid. - Better leave it. What is in the tower over there? I have seen a tower there. Why are you interested in it? I am only curious. Be greeted. Are you on your way back? No, Brother Kjell. We have other plans. - The youngest happenings in this village have raised the worst fears ever here. - We cannot stay here any longer. You want to go away? That's how it is. You know what happened back then, Brother Kjell. And now, the arrival of those men, promises great mischief. Jorunn had predicted, that the evil will come over us. I will take my family and we will escape tonight from here. What are you talking about? This place won't let you go. We have to try it. And you should do it now. Before it is too late. Hua! May God be with you! God is already not with us anymore for since long time! You fools... What are you doing there... How far are we already? Not far enough. We are still inside the village. - But the village is already behind us. We haven't made it yet. No. No! The village won't let us go! - Rubbish! It is only a tree. A storm probably... But we cannot pass it. Let us turn around. No, we must not turn around. Let us continue by foot. It is not far anymore. Let us don't waste any time. - Now, come on. In what direction do we have to go? There along. Stay close behind me. What is that?! It won't let us go! Come on, we will do this! Lord, Almighty, forgive me. I beg you, forgive me. I cannot continue anymore. I do not know what to do anymore. I just know that I cannot stand all this again. I really cannot continue anymore. Oh Lord, forgive me! My Lord has sent me, Svende. Yes, I know your name. Did you expect my arrival? I don't know it... I have... I have felt, that something would happen. My Lord had mentioned you. He knows of your pain. Of you loss, which is begging you. No, please... Please... He is still alive. - You are wrong. He is dead, already long time. But he is my master, who can change that. So much sorrow in you, that he could end it. What would you give him for that? What could I give him? - He is not a tyrant. Not the dragon, which you humans see in him. He merely claims a small victim from you. In return, your husband will come back to you. You'll be able to hold him in your arms. So as once before. Tell me, what I should do! Your daughter. Aaltje. Bring her to me, so my master can feast on her. Not my daughter, please! You cannot demand that from me! - Yes I can! Your God has claimed from Abraham, that he should sacrifice his son. What, however, is this sacrifice here? Nothing compared to happiness, if a family is to be reunited. I cannot... - It doesn't make sense to lie, Svende. He knows your thoughts. He knows, that you love your departed husband more than your daughter. And you would do everything, to have him back with you. We both know it. You only have to say it. So: Will you do it? Yes. I will. That's how it should be. Open? How can that be? The door was open? and the ash... What? ... the ash was scattered over the ground. My goodness... What should we do now? Nothing. None ever has to hear from that. Also not Holmger. Do you hear me? None! We have to tell the others. No one knows, what will happen now. It won't happen anything. Nothing at all. Because nothing happened. That's how it is. Maybe it's better, to not give any attention this matter. If one is blind, one cannot close the eyes. Never. Who do you think, is responsible of this? Brother Jaro had the only key. - Where is Brother Jaro? Have you seen yet him today? No. Not today. And yesterday he nearly seemed frightened. You have heard him, right. Who knows, what he has done. We have to search for him. Search everywhere for him. Jaro! Brother Jaro! Have you seen Brother Jaro? Today? Not today. Brother Jaro? Wait, I will do that. - You don't have to help me. I have done this yearslong, something like this won't be forgotten. Help me! Please... help me! - He should release me! Let me go! Please, help me! - Yes, we will help him. I will get the doctor. What is with him? Did he wake up? Aren't they, what you think. They will... kill you! Please... Please, don't let me... ... die here! We won't let that happen. You have let the devil... ... to you... to you... What has happened? Tell me please, what is up! He is dead. Nothing more, what Goran still could do. May the Lord be gracious with your immortal soul. On that they find peace in the eternal kingdom of heaven. Amen. Should we bury him, or would you like to do it yourself? We will do it ourselves. After all he was our comrade. Behind the village is a good spot, which I will show you later. Your loss in honour, but you won't have much time to mourn about him. We don't have to mourn about him. We only want to bury him decently. We have lost so many comrades. We cannot grieve about everyone. He as well, only was a victim of many, of this war. Whether his family will see that like this as well? So that's how it is in this world. When it doesn't suit you, complain by your God. He wanted to tell me something. Before he died. He wanted to warn me before something. Maybe he wanted to clean his soul from the sins. I believe, he didn't have anything more to confess. Every one of us is encumbered with guilt and sin. I feel the burden of sin day by day. Lord, almighty God, I beg you to forgive me. I am only a poor sinner, but you give me absolution, because you are huge. Come, pray with me. We stand in front of you, strong in believe and in knowledge of your godly charity. Come, kneel down. - No. Oh Lord, give mercy to us, in the hard hours of loss. Hear our payer, oh Lord. What's up with that? Let me go! I don't want to pray! So I am begging you for absolution for me and as well for the disbelievers, because you will also welcome them merciful. Amen. God in his boundless grace, still loves you. Everything good, my darling. Come, we will now visit someone. Mother, what...? What are we doing here? It's all right. It won't happen anything to you. She had promised. What? I don't understand all this... It will be all right, when your father is back. My master is coming, to become one with you, my child. Welcome him! Mother, what is happening here? It's all right. It won't happen anything to you. No, please... What...? My God... What is that? Aaltje, please don't defend yourself. Do not deny yourself to him, my child. He will make you to his servant. It is a gift that you should appreciate. No, please not! Please, let me go! - Aaltje, please! It has to be. For our family. Please. No! No, please! Because in the evening, at which he was delivered and submitted to the suffering of his own free will, he took the bread and said thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples and said: Take and eat, all of you; this is my body which is given for you. Likewise, he took the cup after supper, thanked again, handed it to his disciples and said: Take and drink, all of you; this is the cup of the new and everlasting covenant, my blood, which is shedded for you for all for the remission of sins. Do this in remembrance of me. Pray brothers and sisters, that my and your sacrifice may be pleasing to God the Almighty. May the Lord accept the sacrifice from your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our blessing, and all his Holy Church. Come and try, how good God is. The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ. What happened? She spit it out! She spit out the host! No, it's nothing, really! Something is wrong with my daughter, you see it! She is only slightly ill. - Nonsense! If she has repelled the Body of Christ, she has the devil in herself! - She is just sick, damn it! You dare to curse in the house of God?! Did she infect you?! Are you also possessed by evil's demon?! Bring her home. Quick. We will take care of her later. Marie, come? bring your sister home. Please. She needs to rest. Yes, Mother. I will take care of her. Yes, bring her away merely quick! - Now let her go! Everything will clear up! She is not possessed. You are all misled. - Misled? I see no other explanation than the ministry of the devil. Strange things have happened in the last few days. Brother Jaro is still disappeared, no one knows what happened to him. Brother Rasmus, We must not fall into superstition. We both know that... What is happening? My goodness... It is really him. Mikael... Almighty God... You are back! Mikael? That cannot be. We thought, you were dead. Fallen. So it was in any case. Probably a mistake. - Oh, Mikael! My beloved Mikael! You cannot imagine, how often I prayed for it, that you come back to me. And now you are here. Yes, that's me, Svende. My beloved Svende. Tell us, were have you been? And why are you already back? You don't seem wounded. How true. So tell us, why are you not at the front anymore? They send me home. That really doesn't matter! Mainly you are back. I still cannot really believe, that you survived it. He did not. I am telling you: that is not Mikael! What is wrong now?! How do you come up with this? Mikael is dead! Whoever is here in front of you, he is not Mikael! Mikael has fallen in war. Don't you smell the stink of decay?! - Now it's enough! Don't you have done enough damage yet?! Mikael, don't you want to say anything to this statement? I am tired from the arduous journey home. I would like to rest a little bit. Yes, come. Rest here. We will go home now. Please simply don't note us. We should be vigilant. Too many things have happened in the past days. Mikael's return stirs a fortiori my suspicions. Not only yours... It doesn't work any longer, no. All that has to end now, do you understand? No, understand nothing. What do you want to tell me? Here evil is happening, that we cannot let happen. We are not at the battlefield now. We cannot pretend, that all this would not involve us. - It does not concern us at all. We should have never come here! I will go away from here, still tonight. You can come with me or leave it. Are you insane? You just cannot go away! How far do you think, you would get? That doesn't matter. There has to be a going back for me. It's not too late yet. Still, that's it. Jesper... I am afraid... afraid, what is expecting me, if I stay here. You are making a bad mistake. As if nothing has ever happened. It still will remain a mystery what has happened in the church. Pray for her, Svende. Pray that it is not true, what I have expected. Many thanks, Brother Rasmus. That you no longer take part in the witch hunt. Witch hunt? This is much more serious. I don't think, that this is over yet. Could you still watch my husband. I just want to make sure, that he came back from war undamaged. Should not Goran better do this? I am not a doctor. Don't you worry? my Lord won't betray you. How can God help me? ?Not God. My Lord is another one. As well as yours. You are obedient to him. Because the world will belong to him. Come and pray with me. Physically he is totally fine. As far as I can judge this. It's doesn't seem that he is missing anything. If anything with Aaltje's condition changes, than have me called. I will send Sister Liska tomorrow to look for her. What did I tell you? Your father is back. He is back again. - Thanks to God. You have always given us hope, mother. Aaltje? Can I do something for you? No? Oh, I am so full of gratitude that I have got you again. I couldn't mourn, because I knew, that you would come back. I have missed you so much, Mikael. I have also missed you. Let them both be, you shouldn't see that. Aaltje, please... What are you doing? Let us go. The Lord is calling after us. No. No, please... No, I didn't want that! Please, let me go! I beg you! What's the matter? Can't you sleep? Everything is fine. We are back together. Like how it should be. I love you so much, Mikael. It's all right, you don't have to talk. Come to my side. Kjell! Did you dream of me again this night? Why do you think, your God is torturing you? Why do you think, your God grudged you the pleasures of carnal lust? Tell me: why? Because he's a bitter, vengeful creature, which hates people. That is why he loves it to torture you. Come and taste what my God could give to you. Oh Lord, forgive me. I am weak. Why do you want forgiveness from him? What kind of God is that, which drives you into sin only to than offer his forgiveness to you later? He is playing with you. All eyes are awaiting you, Lord and give them their fare right on time. You do open your hand and saturate everything, what is alive, against your delight. Amen. Amen. Come, eat. You have to gain strengths again. What is with him? His name is Enner. Poor old man. His mind is confused. Always? No, certainly not. He used to be our priest in the village. Some say, that he has seen the devil. In as much as you believe in such things. It seems, as he is watching us. Appearances are deceptive. He's not in his right mind. After dinner, I'll get right back on my feet. I still need three strong men on the field outside. I'll come with you. They were just outside. They are still resting. You still have to be patient. Nothing runs away from you. We are lagging behind with the harvest, you know that. What about you, Mikael? Once you're back now, you can also nevertheless work. Or do you not want it? He is still too weak. If he does feel healthy, to jump on you, than he could also work. Aaltje! Welcome home, father. - Our all hero. Where have you been at the front? Here or in Finland? In Finland. Near the Baltic Sea. And most recently at Parkumaki. A big battle, as I have heard. Our reverend King Gustav would have been proud of you. A cheer to our King! Don't you dare! This village is a place of God, not of King Gustav! Forgive me. So what is up, proud war hero? Are you coming with me? - Maybe. Later. What should that, Mikael? Do you think, that you just can come back and lay lazy on you back? We all know, that something is wrong with you. Likewise as with your eldest. We all have seen that. Now let him his peace. Only once he behaves like on of us! But he doesn't do this. What do you want than?! You filthy hypocrite! You miserable pack! You make me sick! Mikael, what in God's name is wrong with you? What is with him?! Mikael! For God's sake! No! No! That cannot be true! That was not the deal! So it wasn't agreed upon! That was not the deal! Bring him back to me! Almighty God, Svende... what have you done? So it wasn't agreed upon! We had an arrangement! Give him back to me! What she is talking about? Now don't be foolish, Holmger. Everyone has heard and seen it: she is with the devil! She had a pact with him! You have heard it yourself! I have told you from the beginning: that wasn't Mikael. Mikael was already long time dead. She has taken up with the arch-enemy in person! The smell of corruption is flowing from her! Come with me, come on! What do you have planned with her? I will cast out Satan from her. Once and for all! He no longer will have her! I won't rest until he desists from her! Come with me! He cannot do this! - So, he can. Let him do. He knows what to do. And you are only watching it? She is still one of you. No. Not anymore. How long do you want to keep her locked there? As long as it is necessary. As long as our arch-enemy will let go from her. She will die in there. - Than that's how it should be! If there is still a piece of God's glory in her, then she will fight Satan and be cleaned again. It's all in her own will. You cannot do this, Brother Rasmus... Believe me, it's the only way to save her soul. Wake up, faithful servant of God! That cannot be... How did you get out of there? Come with me. - What is happening here...? What unspeakable outrage commits her in here... I will not tolerate that you pay homage to Satan! Stop, you miserable sinner! Almighty God in heaven! Do not let that happen, that they sneer at you so! Brother Kjell! You are a man of God, let go, from this vicious urge! Do you smell it? It smells like sulfur. He is not far anymore. My body you could have destroyed? but both our souls will burn commonly in the fires of hell! You worship a golden calf! All of you sin against yourself to the heaviest! God will not allow, that you will have strength over me. All of them can offer you pleasures, of which your God would not even dare to dream of. No, you already have devoted to his will. Listen to me carefully, my beloved daughter: Your oh so dear mother hasn't kicked to bucket for free. That's all part of a greater whole. And you, you little whore of Lucifer, you'll as well do something for him now. Aaltje? Is that you? Aaltje? What are you doing there? Nothing. Go away! What in God's name are you doing there? Nothing in God's name! He will come! And we are paving the pathway. The way to our world. You are digging out his ash. Yes, his ash! Stop this, you little beast! You don't know what you are doing there! Take of your hands of me, you monstrosity! There is nothing more, you could do against this. You say, you can see the future? Than tell me: what are you seeing now? Where is he? - I there. Have a look. My godness... how long is he been doing this? I don't know it. But he is not reacting on anything. Brother Rasmus! Help me to bring him away from here. Jorunn! Do you know, where Goran is? - No, I don't know. I have to talk to you. Something is happening here. Something evil. I see that as well. Brother Rasmus seems to be completely off sense. What had happened to him? We don't know that exactly. Did Anders make it? What do you think? I cannot imagine he did. Not with the best wishes... This fool. I still have warned him. What's happening here? We have found him like this? he is not himself. He got him. Like others before him. How long do you still want to deny, what is happening here? Who got him? What are you talking about? They have set him free, yes! The arch-enemy! Released? The ash, it is extincted. He is free. Among us! Is that true, what he is saying? Jorunn? Yes. I don't know, who is in charge for this, but... - Why haven't you told me anything? We are talking about the Incarnate! Free! Free! He is free! Do something for him! - What should I do that?! Against the devil every medicine is helpless! What in the world are you talking about? Devil? The Incarnate? Nothing, which would concern you, Lieutenant. - Sot! This all seems to concern myself a lot! We are in the middle of this haunting. So let us finally know, what is happening here! Don't you dare, Jorunn... Let her speak. This village was to be on the verge of being completely eradicated. 1771, when the Black Death raged here. It gathered everyone and everything there, it was only a matter of time. Until an odd stranger came to the village. Some rumored that time, it was the devil himself. But it was not like that. He promised a way out. The plague should desist from the village. And he kept his word. Nobody knew how it happened, but it went over. Full of gratitude one fulfilled him a request: an urn containing ash, which he carried around with him, we should keep for him. Not just any ash, as we found out only later: the ashes of the last mortal husk, which the devil on earth took in possession. Locked up in a small container. The ashes burned ceaselessly. As long as it does not go out, Satan would remain banned. So it seemed... And you believe all this? - Believing or not believing, did not matter: we had made a pact with him. So we locked the ashes in that tower nearby the village. Of course, the devil had not disappeared from the world. But he could not take any more a shape, no longer being "alive". Part of the burning ashes we scattered around in a circle around the village. So he would not leave the village anymore. - That is why the ground here is so warm. So warm, that still corn can be planted here. But Satan could not be locked away without a fight. His servants defended themselves. What was the fate for me and my father Enner. Hell had swallowed us up. Three long days. Heat. Pain. Torments. I cannot remember more. Then it spit us out again. They returned again from the depths of hell. This is how my mother has told me it. Jorunns hair became white. And from now on she was blind. And Enner was insane in his head. He never became the same person again. Satan was trapped, caged in the tower. But not only him was locked from now on. No one could ever leave the village from now on. No one? What is with those men, who went to war? Some died immediately, some short time later. The men left for war, of course. But all have fallen. Nobody ever came back. No one can leave this village. Here are many more of them. No survivors. Go on further! What is? Why are you looking at me like that? I think, they have finally seen it. They probably understand it now. My God, I should have known... You were meant! Christer wanted to warn us from you! What?! What's up here? Let them run! They won't get very far. We are running out of time! That is true. We really don't have time for games anymore. She supposedly sees so many things. So many things since her resurgence. But the essence has passed unnoticed by her. What are you doing? Who are you? Where to, Lieutenant?! They are also on the right wing! Do you hear me?! Where should we go? - Hold line! Keep the line! There are too many! Keep the line, no matter what happens! They are falling one after another! We cannot make this! Stay together! Stay together! - Lieutenant, command the retreat! We hardly have men left. We will croak! Lieutenant! These men are awaiting your command! Lieutenant, we are only six men! Damn! Five men! They are coming! Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! Can you see it Do you see it? Yes. What a shame. So young... A life, which wasn't lived yet. Lieutenant? you couldn't bring this any further. No... No, I cannot... What can't you do? To take it? What did he gave you? He allowed that you die. I am... I was a soldier. Always. As a soldier it should be an honour to die for his country. A lie! Nothing more than a lie. A lie, which you regale to yourself! You want to live. Yes. My God brings you to the scratch. My God allows you to live. Or do you want to rot under the moist soil? Say, that you want to live. Say it. I want to live. Yes. Live. I want to live. I want to live. I want to live. I cannot be over now. Not now. Everyone makes this choice. Everyone. But it is a deal. What do I have to do? My Lord has a task for you. If you fulfill it, you're free. Not far from here there is a village. Small, inconspicuous. There you shall all go. Find an excuse to be taken there. Keep your eyes open. What is our duty there? It is the eternally burning ashes of my Lord, which blazes there in a tower, locked away for a long time. Bring it to extinction. Tell me how. A man of God? he will die. He chooses suicide? an unpardonable sin. A heart that has fallen into God's disfavor. This heart, rottened through sin, opens the door through which I will proceed? ahead our Lord. So give me access to this village. Only then the new time era can be initiated. We will follow your will. Not my will, no. I am only a servant of my Lord. And my Lord will also be from now on your Lord as well. Go, to smoothen the way to this world for him. Go! What... What did happen to you? You are alive! Yes, seems like it. We were lucky. Huge luck. I thought, you were gone... Oh, my God! No. Your God is dead. He is coming. He is coming! Can't you hear him coming?! You don't know, what you are doing there. If he ever returns to this world... it is unimaginable what that could mean. Perhaps he will make a better world than this. Your God has left this one here a long time ago. And left you with him alone. We don't have time anymore. His arrival is near. Leave them back here. Their creatures are already on the way to here. Forgive me, Jorunn. I am weak. Brother Kjell? Is that you? It had happened, do you hear me? The bells are ringing for his arrival. He is almost there. You cannot let this happen. I am too weak. Don't you realize, that it is already too late? Much too late to fight against it. But not too late to abdicate from your God and to swear loyalty to my Lord. I am serving the only really God. And Jesus Christ, his innate son, our Lord. Everybody has turned their back on him. Abdicate yourself from him and you will also begin a new life on the side of Lucifer. You will be able to see. You will be able to feel. Never ever I will abdicate from God! Where is your God than? God only watches you, he is not here. Prevent yourself from him? before it is too late. No! Not even to be able to live? - Not even that, if I have to die for it. If you only would know... than it should be like this. Let us go? time has come. We are here, the children, which we are, of the one true Lord. We are devoted to him and in thrall to him. We are open the gates to him to return to this world. Let is ring the bells for his arrival. God's bondage is now over! Let us welcome our Lord! Kneel down, my disciples! The time has come! It is time to offer the Lord our sacrifice. He, who gave us unimaginable joys? let us worship him! He will come to us as we present him with this sacrifice. So bring the only true offering, the Lord of Fire. Show him how faithful devoted you are to him. Come, oh you my Lord! The time of your redemption has arrived. Come and show your face! Behold, people of the world! The dragon is reborn. He came! No. He was already here the whole time. In the figure of Enner. Since the ash extincted, he is free. That's how it is. Why then the whole thing? Why have sacrificed themselves to fetch him? An examination, nothing more. Our Lord wanted to test, weather his disciplines are surely loyal to him. Let us celebrate his arrival! Lucifer, my Lord. I, your servant, fall humbly in front of you on my knees. Let me serve you on your right side. I beg you, let me serve you! We should have never done it! He won't let us go anymore. Good God, so help us now!
