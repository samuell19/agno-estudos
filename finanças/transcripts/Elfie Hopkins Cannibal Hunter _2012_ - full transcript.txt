I KNEW IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW THEM. I KNEW IT. BUT 20 MINUTES AGO, YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE GAMMONS WERE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. THINGS CHANGE, PARKER. YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT. MAYBE THEY'RE ON THE LAM FROM THE BULLS. LAM FROM THE BULLS? I'M TELLING YOU, PARKER. WE ARE ONTO SOMETHING THIS TIME. THIS IS IT. LET'S GET OUT THERE, CELEBRATE. ELFIE? ELFIE? ELFIE... OH, GOD. SCREW ME SIDEWAYS, YOU SCARED ME. SORRY, HOPKINS. WHAT, I MEAN... CAN'T THIS WAIT? IT'S REALLY EARLY. I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE DIGGING. WHAT'S THE RUMBLE? THEY DO A LOT OF MOVING AROUND. THEY MOVED AROUND ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE TIMES IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, MOSTLY IN EUROPE, ONCE IN URUGUAY, AND ONCE IN AMERICA. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THAT, THOUGH. HM. GOOD JOB, PARKER. YOU'RE A GOOD EGG. I HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON YOUR MATE CHARLIE. - CHARLIE? - MM. WELL, LISTEN TO THIS: HE TOOK A SET OF KNIVES TO BUTCHER BRYN'S TO GET SHARPENED. HMM? WELL, THEY WERE FANCY, KIND OF BIG, LIKE BUTCHER BRYN'S. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING INTERESTING ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, ESPECIALLY IN THIS VILLAGE. AND WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU, PARKER? FORGET EVERYTHING, FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE. ELFIE? COME ON, ELFIE, GET UP. FINE. YEAH, UM, FOLLOW THE NOSE... F-FOLLOW YOUR EVIDENCE. WHAT, PARKER? SPEAK UP. I COULDN'T HEAR YOU. NOTHING. THEN I GUESS WE'LL PAY A LITTLE VISIT TO BUTCHER BRYN. HELLO, BRYN. ELFIE HOPKINS AND DYLAN PARKER. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO MY FINE ESTABLISHMENT? BRYN, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU. YOU'VE MET THE GAMMONS, RIGHT? OH, YES, THE GAMMONS. I DON'T KNOW 'EM WELL. DECENT FAMILY, I WOULD SAY. AND, UH, YOU DID A LITTLE BIT OF WORK FOR CHARLIE, RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? I SHARPENED HIS KNIVES, THAT'S ALL. THEY'RE FINE KNIVES. THEY'RE RUSSIAN, HE TELLS ME. HE'S A SPIRITUAL MAN, I'D SAY. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? HE TAKES BUTCHERING SERIOUSLY. NOW, FOR ME, IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK, BUT, FOR HIM... IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT, ELFIE HOPKINS? WELL, THERE'S BEEN SOME, AH, STRANGE OCCURRENCES IN THE VILLAGE, BRYN. WE'RE JUST LOOKING INTO IT. NOW, I KNOW ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT STRANGE OCCURRENCES. YOU DON'T SAY. COME HERE. MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS A LAD... YOUNGER THAN YOU... EVERY MORNING FOR A FORTNIGHT, FARMERS WOKE, FIND THEIR SHEEP HAD BEEN MUTILATED. EVERY MORNING, THEY'D GO OUT HUNTING. AND EVERY EVENING, THEY'D COME BACK EMPTY-HANDED. MY FATHER, HE WOULDN'T LET ME GO. BUT CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF ME, AND... ONE NIGHT, I BORROWED HIS HUNTING RIFLE. IT WAS A FULL MOON, I REMEMBER THAT. MIST WAS ROLLING IN. I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS, BUT THEN, I COULD SEE THESE EYES BURNING LIKE FLAMES THROUGH THE MIST. WHAT WAS IT? IT WERE A STAG. WHAT? FUCK OFF, IT WASN'T A STAG. IT WERE, ELFIE HOPKINS. IT WAS DRIPPING WITH BLOOD. ENTRAILS WERE HANGING FROM ITS ANTLERS, AND IT HAD A COAT OF WOOL FROM SLAIN SHEEP ACROSS THE MOUND OF ITS BACK. CAUGHT HOLD OF MY SCENT, TURNED HIS HEAD SLOWLY... CHARGED! MUD AND BLOOD SPEWING UP BEHIND HIM. I ONLY HAD A SECOND, SO I FIRED ONE OFF. HE ROARED, AS THE BULLET TOOK OUT ONE OF HIS LEGS. BUT HE KEPT CHARGING ME. I TOOK A DEEP BREATH. I FIRED AGAIN. THIS TIME THE SHOT RANG TRUE. GOT HIM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES. HIS BRAINS SPLATTERED IN THE NIGHT SKY. AND HE FELL. HE CRUMBLED AT MY FEET. RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY TOES. THAT IS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE EVER HEARD. SHH! BUT YOU ARE FULL OF IT, THOUGH, BRYN. AM I, ELFIE HOPKINS? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, BRYN. WE GOT TO HIT THE ROAD. YOU BE CAREFUL, ELFIE HOPKINS. HMM? JESUS CHRIST, DID YOU SEE THAT, HOPKINS? SUSANNAH WANTS ME TO DROP SOMETHING AT CHARLIE'S, AND IF I DON'T DO IT, SOON SHE'LL BE ON THE DOUBLES. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND WHEN I'M THERE. OKAY, I'LL KEEP DIGGING. OH, HI, ELFIE. HELLO, MRS. GAMMON. LOTTY. SUSANNAH WANTED ME TO BRING THIS OVER FOR, UM, MR. GAMMON. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. AND PLEASE, CALL ME ISABELLE. HE'S SUCH A CUTIE. COULDN'T YOU JUST EAT HIM UP? CHARLIE, SHOULD WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE? I THINK WE'RE JUST FINE, DON'T YOU? HEY, ELFIE. HOW'S THINGS? WE'VE JUST BOOKED A HOLIDAY TO EAST AFRICA. IT'S, UM... IT'S GONNA COST A FORTUNE. HUNTING IN AFRICA? THAT'S A BIT BARBARIC. I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF BAGGING THE BIG FIVE. NOW, THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM, WILL IT CHARLIE? NO. WELL... GRANTED, A FEW OF THEM ARE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST, BUT I'M SURE WE'LL FIND A WAY AROUND THAT. WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING THE HIVE? IN A FEW DAYS. SUCH A LOT TO DO. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO. I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW US AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO, DESPITE PICKING THROUGH OUR RUBBISH. NOW, COME ON, LOTTY. THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT. I'D BE PRETTY DAMN HAPPY IF MY KIDS TURNED OUT LIKE ELFIE. NOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE AND JUST... YOU KNOW, GIVE HER A BREAK, HM? SORRY. RIGHT, WHO'S UP FOR A CELEBRATION DRINK? WHAT'S WITH YOU? NOTHING. HI, PARKER. MM-HMM. HOW'S THE GUMSHOEING? WELL, SLOW, BUT THE DEEPER I GET, THE STRANGER THE GAMMONS SEEM. HOW'D IT GO WITH YOU? HM. WHAT'S UP? YOU'RE NOT YOUR MELANCHOLY SELF. MELANCHOLY IS FOR TEENAGE BOYS. I WAS JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW, CHARLIE'S A GOOD EGG. HOPKINS, REMEMBER THAT WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE GAMMONS, RIGHT? YOUR IDEA, MAY I ADD. I KNOW, I KNOW. JUST SAYING THAT I THINK THAT HE'S ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HE BACKED ME UP WITH LOTTY. IT'S JUST NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE BELIEVE IN ME ONCE IN A WHILE. WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? JUST TRYING TO ACCESS A FEW DATABASES... POLICE, VOTERS REGISTRATION, THAT KIND OF THING... TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE GAMMONS. NERD STUFF. YEAH. NERD STUFF. YOU GOT INTO UNI IN THE CITY? IT'S NOTHING. I... NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU APPLIED. MY DAD MADE ME. I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO. SO YOU... I MEAN, YOU WILL ACTUALLY GO, THEN? NO, I... IT'S... I DEFERRED IT A YEAR. SO YOU'RE GOING NEXT YEAR? NO. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE... JUST... JUST GIVE ME THAT AND FORGET ABOUT IT. DON'T WORRY, LITTLE BOY. I'LL LET YOU HAVE HIM WHEN I'M FINISHED. OH, SORRY. DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE VOMITED THEIR CLOTHES ON YOU. DID YOU START SKYDIVING? WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT? WELL, YOU MUST HAVE SKYDIVED INTO THOSE TROUSERS. BEST CAMEL TOE I'VE SEEN IN YEARS. FUNNY. JESUS. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I GREW UP. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT. I'D, UM, LOVE TO STAY AND CHITCHAT, BUT I'M GOING TO GO PULL MY FINGERNAILS OUT. PLEASURE AS ALWAYS. - HEY, CHARLIE. - HEY. I HAVE A HOUSEWARMING GIFT FROM SUSANNAH. OH, OKAY. THANKS. SHE'S, UH... WELL, SHE'S PERSISTENT, ISN'T SHE? SORRY, DON'T MIND ME. I'D JUST BEEN DOING MY YOGA. SOMETHING WE LEARNED IN INDIA FROM THE AGHORIS TRIBE. FASCINATING, REALLY. A LOT OF INFORMATION I, UH, DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW. - YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A GO? - OH, NO THANKS. SELF-IMPROVEMENT ISN'T HIGH ON MY LIST OF THINGS TO DO. OH, COME ON, STOP BEING SO COOL. NO, I'M... NOT SURE. COME ON, TRY IT. COME SIT DOWN. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. JUST SIT LIKE THIS. IF YOU TELL ANYONE, I'M COMING AFTER YOU. HOPING WHAT? UM... YOU HAVE THIS. WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS? UH, WELL IT'S... YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. BEST FILM NOIR EVER MADE. AH, WELL, THE MALTESE FALCON OR DOUBLE INDEMNITY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT, BUT IT'S GOT THE BEST LAST LINE IN A MOVIE EVER: "FORGET IT, JAKE." "IT'S CHINATOWN." YOU DO KNOW IT. MAN, I TRIED WATCHING IT WITH MY POPS, BUT HE JUST DIDN'T GET IT. I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE'S NOT A BAD GUY OR ANYTHING... ELFIE, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: MOST OF US PARENTS AREN'T BAD GUYS, AND ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'LL JUST REALIZE WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS, JUST LIKE YOU AND JUST AS FUCKED UP. GUESS SO. ANYWAY, HE'S, UM, HE'S ALL I'VE GOT NOW, SO... IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING, WHERE'S YOUR MUM? SHE DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 12. SHE WAS SHOT. MURDERED. MURDERED? WELL, BY, UH, WELL, BY WHO? NEVER FOUND OUT. I MEAN, THE POLICE SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, BUT I DIDN'T BUY IT. OH. OH, I GET IT NOW. WELL, YOU KNOW I, AH... I TRIED TO WORK THE CASE AND SEE, YOU KNOW... CONVINCE THE CONSTABLE AND CONVINCE MY DAD, BUT I... I JUST COULDN'T SOLVE IT. I JUST COULDN'T GET... HOW COULD YOU EVER SOLVE IT? IF THE POLICE COULDN'T... WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE YOURSELF SUCH A HARD TIME. GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THIS SERMON. LET'S TRY THIS YOGA. COME ON. HI, ELFIE. HI, ISABELLE. DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? SO, LOTTY. GOING TO SPEND SOME BLOOD MONEY? AND PLAY YOUR BLOOD SPORTS? MAYBE GET YOURSELF A LITTLE BLOOD DIAMOND TOO? GET OUT OF THE CAR. RIGHT, COME ON, JUST... GET. COOL YOUR HEAD, TIMOTHY. I'M GONE. I MEAN, HONESTLY. DID SHE TOUCH YOU? - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DARLING? - YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU OKAY? I SWEAR TO GOD, IF SHE TOUCHES ONE LITTLE FINGER ON YOUR HEAD... DON'T EVEN LOOK AT HER, DARLING. DON'T LOOK AT HER. WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU? YOU TOLD ME TO WORK THE CASE; I WORKED IT. HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP ANYTHING? WHAT ABOUT FOLLOWING THE EVIDENCE? OH, COME ON. I'M JUST HAVING A LAUGH. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAVING FUN IS? OH, DON'T BE A TOOL. WHAT DO YOU CARE ANYWAY? YOU'RE ABOUT TO DITCH ME FOR UNI ANY DAY NOW, RIGHT? WHAT? NO, I'M NOT. CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE THINKING STRAIGHT. SEE YOU LATER. PARKER. DYLAN. ALL RIGHT, PARKER. ALL RIGHT. MAYBE I JUST SHAKE THE TREE AND SEE WHAT FALLS. ELFIE, HEY. DID WE HAVE ANOTHER CLASS SCHEDULED? MM, NO, UH... STILL SORE FROM LAST TIME. UM, ACTUALLY, I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. - ARE YOU BUSY? - NO, NO. GO AHEAD. COME ON. - DO YOU WANT TO COME IN? - NO. SO THE JENKINS LEFT FOR THE AFRICAN TRIP YESTERDAY. YEAH. YEAH, WELL, THEY, UH... THEY GOT OFF ON TIME. THEY'RE PROBABLY NOW RELAXING IN BUSINESS CLASS, BASTARDS. WHEN ARE THEY COMING BACK? WELL, THEY... WELL, THEY BOOKED A THREE-MONTH TRIP, SO THREE MONTHS WOULD BE THE ANSWER. OH, DON'T TELL ME, YOU'RE NOT MISSING LOTTY ALREADY? I SAW YOU AND ELLIOT FOLLOW THE JENKINS, AND YOU CAME HOME WITH NO ELLIOT, BUT HE FOLLOWED AN HOUR LATER. JUST SEEMED A LITTLE BIT ODD. WAIT A MINUTE. IS THIS ONE OF YOUR INVESTIGATIONS? HAVE YOU BEEN STAKING OUT MY HOUSE? I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS. WE ARE. JUST WONDERING. THAT'S ALL. WELL, ARE YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T STONED? SORRY. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. LIKE I SAID, I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WELL, LOOK, I TOLD YOU TO DROP IT, SO DROP IT. ALL RIGHT, I HAVE THINGS TO DO. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. I SEE THAT PIPPA'S BEEN COMING AROUND. SHE GOT A THING FOR A MARRIED MAN? DON'T FUCK WITH ME, ELFIE. ALL RIGHT? CHARLIE. THAT LANGUAGE... DON'T YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING DELICATE I AM? WELL, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ACCUSE PEOPLE OF. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? NOTHING. LOOK, SORRY. THAT WASN'T FAIR, WAS IT? WE CAME HERE FOR A BIT OF PEACE AND QUIET, AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY ENTERTAINING, AND I LIKE YOU, ELFIE. ALL RIGHT? LET'S JUST KEEP IT THAT WAY. INTERVIEW WITH CHARLIE HAS CONVINCED THAT MY FIRST INSTINCTS WERE RIGHT. THE WHOLESOME FAMILY ACT? I DON'T BUY IT. EVERYONE HAS A SECRET, AND THE MORE PERFECT THEY SEEM, THE DARKER IT IS. OH, AND, CHARLIE BOY, YOU DON'T WANT TO FUCK WITH ME, EITHER. WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE? RAPHAEL. HM. WHO WAS THAT? ELFIE. SHE WAS ASKING ABOUT THE JENKINS. I THINK WE'VE BECOME THE TARGET OF ONE OF HER INVESTIGATIONS. CHARLIE, NO. DON'T LET HER SPOIL THIS FOR YOU. WE'VE JUST GOT HERE. AH, DON'T WORRY. IT WILL BE FINE. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. YOU KIDS WILL JUST HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL. GRACE. PARKER, IT'S ME. IT'S TIME TO DIG DEEPER ON THE GAMMONS. HEY, HOPKINS. SO YOU'RE BACK ON THE CASE? WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, A LITTLE BIRDIE HAD TO REMIND ME WHERE MY HEAD WAS, AND I FINALLY FOUND IT. GOOD BIRDIE. SO I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO PRESS IN THE HOLE AGAIN? YOU LOVE IT. LET'S KEEP OUR EYES ON THE GAMMONS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. YOU CAN HAVE HIM. I'M ALL FINISHED. WHAT? LIAR. THANKS FOR YOUR HELPFUL ADVICE. HE WAS AMAZING. PIPPA. HOW'S IT GOING? HELLO, MR. GAMMON. I THOUGHT I'D JUST DROP BY AND SAY HELLO. IS YOUR WIFE HOME? UH, NO. NO, SHE'S NOT, I'M AFRAID. YOU DON'T MIND IF I MAKE MYSELF FEEL COMFORTABLE, DO YOU? NO, GO AHEAD. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? MAYBE. OR MAYBE I COULD DO SOMETHING FOR YOU? I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO. ARE YOU SURE, CHARLIE? I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF I STAYED. LOOK, I'M NOT LIKE ONE OF THESE PATHETIC MEN IN THORNTREE. YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE ME, DO YOU? I CAN HANDLE ANY MAN, CHARLIE. OH, YOU THINK YOU CAN? THIS ISN'T A GAME, IS IT? STOP IT, CHARLIE. MR. GAMMON, YOU'RE HURTING ME. LEAVE NOW. I'M SORRY. I... I JUST THOUGHT... I'M SORRY. I'LL GO. STOP. COME SIT DOWN. COME SIT DOWN, HM? I LIKE YOU, PIPPA. I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY COOL. I'M NOT. WELL, THE PROBLEM IS, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS VILLAGE. HERE, YOU JUST TEACH HORSE RIDING. OUT THERE YOU COULD BE RIDING A CAMEL THROUGH THE SAHARA DESERT. AT YOUR AGE, YOU SHOULD BE EXPLORING THE WORLD, HAVING AN ADVENTURE. I COULD... WELL, I COULD BOOK YOU A TRIP. WOULD YOU... WOULD YOU TRUST ME TO DO THAT? YES, CHARLIE. I TRUST YOU. OH, GREAT. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, AND INTELLIGENT. YOU'RE WASTED HERE. THANK YOU, CHARLIE. NO... SO FIRST THE JENKINS, AND NOW PIPPA'S FORKED OUT FOR ONE OF THESE GAMMON BOUTIQUE TOURS, AND UNLIKE MOST OF THE SLEAZEBAG MEN IN THIS VILLAGE, CHARLIE APPEARS TO BE IMMUNE TO PIPPA'S CHARMS. WITH HIM DOING HIS DADDY ACT, HE'S GOT HER HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. I THINK IT'S TIME WE TAP UP THOSE FREAKY TWINS. NO WAY. UH-UH. THAT RUBY DAME SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME. OH, COME ON, PARKER. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A BIT OF UNDERCOVER. BESIDES, WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN? HERE. HOLD THIS... LIKE THIS. THAT THERE. SO UM... WHEN DID YOU LEARN TO SHOOT? MY DAD. BEEN SHOOTING SINCE I WAS A CHILD. SO WHAT'S THIS, UM, YOGA RELIGION STUFF YOU GUYS PRACTICE? THAT'S MY PARENTS' STUPID THING. MY DAD WENT ALL NATIVE. THESE ARE GREAT. WHAT'S IN THEM? NOTHING, SILLY. JUST MY LITTLE MEMENTOS. THIS IS WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SHOW YOU. THIS IS A SAMURAI SWORD. IT'S BUILT FOR OPEN FIELD COMBAT, AND IF YOU PLAN ON SLICING THROUGH SOMEBODY, THIS IS THE BLADE TO USE. HEY, WATCH IT. IT'S QUICK AND EASY. THEY DON'T FEEL A THING. SOMETIMES THEY DESERVE IT, DYLAN. NOW, SIT DOWN. I WANT TO TRY SOMETHING. COME ON. SO HOW DO I DO THIS? A GOOD HUNTER ANTICIPATES. IMAGINE YOU WERE A BIRD. WHERE WOULD YOU FLY? FIRE! NICE SHOT. THANKS. YOU'RE A GOOD TEACHER. SO... YOUR PARENTS MET AS MISSIONARIES? IT WAS WHEN DADDY WAS LIVING WITH THE ASMAT TRIBE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA. ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC? YES. INTERESTING. OOH. AND HOW LONG DO THE PEOPLE USUALLY GO ON THESE TRIPS? WHY ALL THE QUESTIONS? IT'S JUST REALLY INTERESTING STUFF. NO, IT ISN'T. WHAT ARE YOU AFTER? UH, EVERYWHERE. THERE WAS THAT LEPER TRIBE IN AFRICA, AND THERE WAS THAT OTHER TRIBE IN WEST PAPUA, BUT EVER SINCE ELLIOT AND I WERE BORN, MUMMY'S MADE DADDY WORK IN THE WEST. THAT IS HOW A GEISHA SHOULD LOOK. YOU'VE GOT GREAT BONE STRUCTURE. HM. VERY NICE. MM... WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT YOUR MUM? SHH, DYLAN. I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. OKAY. WHY ARE YOU STILL IN THIS VILLAGE? YOU'RE MUCH OLDER THAN ME, AND YOU'RE STILL LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS. I'M NOT THAT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU. I LIKE MY MEN TO BE INDEPENDENT, DYLAN. NOW, ANSWER MY QUESTION. WELL, AFTER ELFIE'S MUM DIED, SHE GOT REALLY PROTECTIVE OF HER DAD. BUT THEN SUSANNAH CAME INTO THE PICTURE. AFTER THAT, I GUESS, SHE WAS SCARED THAT SHE'D LOSE HIM COMPLETELY IF SHE WENT AWAY. I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT ELFIE. I ASKED ABOUT YOU. YOU COULD LEAVE. NO... I COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT HER. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER MUMMY? WE WERE PLAYING ONE OF ELFIE'S CRIME-FIGHTING GAMES. ELFIE'S MUM WAS TERRIFIED THAT WE WERE TOO CLOSE TO THE HUNT, SO SHE WENT OUT LOOKING FOR US. SOMEONE FROM THE HUNTING PARTY SHOT HER. OH. THAT'S HORRIFIC. WE WEREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE HUNT. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, BUT ELFIE CONVINCED HERSELF THAT IT WASN'T, THAT SOMEONE SHOT HER ON PURPOSE, SHE WAS MURDERED. NO MATTER WHAT HER FATHER SAID OR WHAT THE POLICE TOLD HER, SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. SHE BLAMED HERSELF, AND THAT IT WAS HER FAULT. THAT WAS OUR FIRST KISS. SORRY. I'VE GOT TO GO. IS THAT ELFIE? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. SORRY. "WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?," SHE SAYS. "WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?" OH, COME ON, YOU ARE KIND OF A DISH. YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME SERIOUS INFORMATION FOR ME, LOOKING LIKE THAT. IT WAS PETRIFYING. SHE SHOULD BE SECTIONED. I DID MANAGE TO GET SOME MORE INFO ON THE GAMMONS PARENTIS. HOW ABOUT YOU? LET'S JUST SAY GAMMON JUNIOR HAS SOME SERIOUS DADDY ISSUES. HE WENT A BIT O.J. SIMPSON ON ME. REALLY? YOU OKAY? COME ON, PARKER. AIN'T NO DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. LET'S PUT THIS TOGETHER. SO WE KNOW THE GAMMONS HAVE LIVED HERE, HERE, AND HERE. IS THAT IT? MM. AH. FORGOT ABOUT THIS. SO THAT'S WHY YOU WERE IN THE JENKINS' CAR. YOU CLEVER LITTLE GIRL. ALWAYS ON THE CLOCK, PARKER. LET'S GIVE THESE A LITTLE RING. THE NUMBER YOU HAVE REACHED IS NOT IN SERVICE. THE NUMBER DOESN'T SEEM LEGIT. COULD BE THE CONNECTION. IT'S KENYA. I HAVE AN IDEA. COURSE YOU DO, PARKER. YOU'RE A BRIGHT BULB. I AM DYL-OID. I AM DYL-OID. YOU KNOW IT. OKAY, SO HERE'S A LITTLE PROGRAM THAT I PUT TOGETHER TO HACK INTO A FEW POLICE AND NEWSPAPER DATABASES, BUT IT SHOULD DO THE TRICK. NERDS RULE. OKAY, SO ACCORDING TO THIS, EVERY VILLAGE THAT THE GAMMONS HAVE MOVED INTO, THERE HAS BEEN A SPIKE IN REPORTED MISSING PEOPLE AND RUNAWAYS. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, THE GAMMONS MOVE INTO A TOWN, AND GRADUALLY THE LOCALS GO MISSING? MM, MAYBE. IT COULD JUST BE A COINCIDENCE. THERE COULD BE ANOTHER CONCLUSION. WHAT EXPLANATION? AND... YOUR GIRLFRIEND JUST SAID SO. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHAT COULD IT BE? CASH SCAM? I DON'T KNOW. WE NEED MORE EVIDENCE. SO WHAT NOW? WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WE AIN'T PRIVATE DICKS FOR NOTHING. LET'S DO IT. I DON'T KNOW, ELFIE. WE'RE GETTING NOWHERE. MAYBE WE WERE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE AGAIN. THE WHOLE VILLAGE LOVES THE GAMMONS. OH, PARKER. ALWAYS HOPING FOR THE BEST. HOW 'BOUT A SPLIFF TO FIGURE IT OUT? ALWAYS. SKIN UP. WHAT'S THAT? AN ACCIDENT. MAYBE. LOOKS LIKE A FUNNY KIND OF ACCIDENT. WHAT IS THAT? SURE LOOKS LIKE BLOOD. MUST'VE COME FROM THE HUNT. I'M NOT SURE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AROUND. ELFIE. SAM AND LOTTY WERE HERE. YOU WAIT, YOU WAIT. LOOK AT ME. HE WAS FROZEN STIFF. HE WATCHED IT. TIMOTHY STRUGGLED WITH THE ATTACKER. HERE. SHE BROKE FREE. MUST'VE BEEN FAST, NO HESITATION, LETTING HER DASH INTO THE WOODS. ELFIE, I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE. DYLAN, I AM NOT GOING TO THE HAMMER AND SAWS. THERE'S SOMEONE COMING. RUN. WHO'S THERE? WHOA! ELLIOT. DID YOU SEE WHO IT WAS? NO. WE HAVE TO TELL MUMMY AND DADDY. OH, COME ON. HELLO? OH, FINALLY. LOOK, MANDY, IT'S ELFIE. NO... WHAT? NO, LOOK. I NEED TO SPEAK TO CONSTABLE KELLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S OUT? WELL, LET ME SPEAK TO SOMEBODY... WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL OUT? WHAT SORT OF MICKEY MOUSE OUTFIT ARE YOU RUNNING HERE, MANDY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE NOT MAKING TROUBLE AGAIN. LOOK, WE FOUND SOMETHING IN THE WOODS. YOU NEED TO COME WITH US. WHAT YOU BLABBING ON ABOUT NOW? WE FOUND SAM JENKINS' TEDDY, AND IT WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. THE GAMMONS KILLED THE JENKINS. - AH... - PLEASE, MRS. HOPKINS. WE REALLY NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND SEE THIS. FINE. OKAY, FINE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? COME WITH US, MRS. HOPKINS. WHAT'S GOING ON? WE FOUND THAT. WHERE'S THE REST OF IT? ELFIE, DYLAN, MRS. HOPKINS. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ALL A BIT TOO LATE. WHAT? HOW? WE HAVEN'T DROPPED THE DIME YET. I SEE. THE, UH, GAMMON KIDS, THEY DROPPED THE DIME. ELLIOT AND RUBY STUMBLED ACROSS THIS, WHAT LOOKS LIKE A TEDDY BEAR HEAD. WE CALLED THE POLICE. STUMBLED? THEY WALKED RIGHT TO IT. WE SAW THEM. THAT WAS YOU IN THE WOODS. AFTER WE FOUND THE TEDDY, WE RUSHED HOME TO CHECK THE JENKINS' ITINERARY ON MUMMY'S COMPUTER. I RANG THE HOTEL. THEY DIDN'T CHECK IN. I RANG THE AIRLINE. THEY DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT ON THE FLIGHT. YOU LIAR. THAT NUMBER DOESN'T EVEN WORK. YES, IT DOES, ELFIE. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT A FEW TIMES. IT IS IN KENYA. THAT'S VERY GOOD WORK, RUBY. GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME. I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. FOUND THIS IN THE BOOT OF HIS CAR ALONG WITH THE JENKINS' PERSONAL BELONGINGS. LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT CAME FROM. WELL, THEY MATCH. DON'T WORRY, MICHAEL. WE'LL LOOK AFTER YOU, OKAY? WHEN THE GAMMONS CALLED, THEY REMINDED US OF YOUR LITTLE FEUD WITH TIMOTHY, AND, WELL, HERE WE ARE. SO WHAT, YOU THINK THE JENKINS ARE DEAD? WELL, GRANTED, WE HAVEN'T FOUND THE BODIES YET, BUT I'M SURE MICHAEL WILL COOPERATE. WON'T YOU, MICHAEL? GO ON. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING, YOU KNOW THAT. OH, COME ON, KELLY. CAN'T YOU SEE HOW CONVENIENT THIS IS? THE GAMMONS FOUND THE TEDDY BEAR? THE GAMMONS SAY MICHAEL DID IT? I MEAN, HOW DON'T YOU SEE HOW OBVIOUS THIS IS? - ELFIE, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. - ELFIE. I KNEW THIS WAS TOO BIG FOR YOU. THAT'S ENOUGH, ELFIE. ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT PLAYING THIS GAME WITH YOU, OKAY? - IT'S AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE. - THEY'RE LYING. I'M SORRY. LET'S GO. WE'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME HERE. I'VE NEVER HEARD SO MUCH RUBBISH. ELFIE JUST HAS AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. YEAH. SO YOU GUYS WILL BE ALL RIGHT. YEAH, FINE. WE'LL GO HOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WELL DONE, GUYS. COME ON. ELFIE. IT'S NOT HIM. I KNOW, PARKER. COME ON. YOU OKAY? SO THE JENKINS ARE DEAD, AND THEN MICHAEL WAS THE KILLER. I DON'T BUY IT. MAYBE WE WERE WRONG. PARKER, YOU DISCOVERED THE PATTERN ON YOUR COMPUTER MOP-UP. I MEAN, WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO BUST THE GAMMONS... AND THEN MICHAEL GETS NABBED FOR IT. MICHAEL AND TIMOTHY HAVE HATED EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. HE HAD A MOTIVE AND AN OPPORTUNITY. MM, PLEASE. THEY SPUN A GOOD TALE, BUT SOMETHING DOESN'T FIT. THANK YOU FOR DRIVING ME TO THE AIRPORT. YOU'RE BEING SO NICE. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY. AH, DON'T BE SILLY. IT'S FORGOTTEN. DID YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID... ABOUT ME BEING BEAUTIFUL AND INTELLIGENT? I THINK YOU'RE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I'VE EVER MET. OOH! YOU'RE A REAL CATCH. YOU'RE A MAN OF THE WORLD. I'M SURE YOU CAN TEACH ME A THING OR TWO. OH, I CAN. YES, I CAN. MMM. OKAY, OKAY. SO WHAT IS THE GAMMONS' M.O.? WHAT ARE THEY UP TO? HOPKINS, YOU ANIMAL. SORRY, I WAS HUNGRY, AND... WAIT. THERE'S NO SAYING WITH JENKINS. GRANTED, WE HAVEN'T FOUND THE BODIES YET... CHARLIE AND I MET IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA WHEN WE WERE BOTH MISSIONARIES. MY DAD WENT ALL NATIVE. PARKER, COMPUTER. CHARLIE, IT'S YOUR WIFE. AH, DON'T WORRY. - OH, COME ON. - OKAY. DID YOU HEAR THAT? I SHOULD REALLY BE GOING. I'M GONNA MISS MY FLIGHT. I CAN MAKE MY OWN WAY THERE. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THAT FLIGHT. GRANTED, WE HAVEN'T FOUND THE BODIES YET, BUT I'M SURE MICHAEL WILL COOPERATE. THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T FIND THE BODIES. WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE? WE SHARE, PIPPA. THAT'S WHAT GOOD FAMILIES DO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE ARE THE CHOSEN. THE GAMMONS ARE CANNIBALS. SHH. WE'LL BE TOGETHER NOW. ELLIOT. WE'VE BEEN MADE. THEY'RE ONTO US. PARKER, CALM DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO TELL SOMEONE. - YOUR DAD. - MY DAD? DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M TELLING MY DAD THIS? WE'LL MAKE SAFE. WE'LL HOLD UP HERE FOR THE NIGHT, AND WE'LL GO TO CONSTABLE KELLY WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. OKAY, BUT GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, ELFIE. I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE. HELLO. I CAN HEAR YOU. MM. - DYLAN. - MM. DYLAN, WHOSE WATCH IS IT? I THINK IT'S MORNING. OH, MY GOD, IT'S A HAND. IT'S A HUMAN HAND. WHAT IS IT? SICK BASTARDS. I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER. LET'S SETTLE THIS NOW. ELFIE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FOLLOW ME. LET'S PUT AN END TO THIS SHIT. I THINK PETRIE IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN LAND BEFORE TIME. THIS IS IT, YOU FREAKS. GIVE ME THAT. I'M GONNA BUST YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, ELFIE? I DON'T KNOW... COME ON, ELFIE. LET'S GO SEE THE CONSTABLE. YEAH, FOLLOW YOUR LAPDOG. DON'T HURT HIM. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? ELLIOT, BACK IN THE HOUSE. BOTH OF YOU, NOW. RIGHT NOW. COME HERE, ELFIE. STOP, JUST STOP. THE GAMMONS ARE CANNIBALS. CANNIBALS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? THAT'S RIDICULOUS. DON'T TOUCH ME. LOOK IN THE ICEBOX. PIPPA'S HAND'S IN IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, ELFIE. WE'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT WITH YOU. I THINK THIS VILLAGE HAS HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF YOU AND YOUR ANTICS. PLEASE, WE'RE TELLING THE TRUTH. COME ON. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF IT. OH, COME ON, ELFIE. LET'S GO TO THE COPS. WHY, WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BELIEVE US NOW? THE GAMMONS AREN'T STUPID. I MEAN, THEY PROBABLY ALREADY LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST US. IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE ONE OF OUR STUPID, MADE-UP, PRETEND INVESTIGATIONS. WELL, WE CAN'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. WHAT'S THE POINT? AND LET'S FACE THE FACTS: I DON'T HAVE A CLUE. YES, YOU DO. I'M A TOTAL FAILURE. IT'S JUST LIKE SUSANNAH SAID. "YOU'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT IT." I COULDN'T EVEN SOLVE MY MUM'S CASE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT? I WAS KISSING YOU. WHY? WELL, YOU WERE KISSING ME TOO, ELFIE. I WAS... SURPRISED. YOU'RE OUT OF LINE, DYLAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I COULD... I COULD NEVER LOOK AT YOU LIKE THAT. LET'S FACE IT. YOU'RE A TOTAL GEEK. SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. YEAH, YOU DID. YOU THINK I LIKE BEING HERE, SURROUNDED BY DEAD ANIMALS AND HUNTERS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BEING STUCK IN THIS DEAD-END VILLAGE, IT'S KILLING ME. YOU ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GET OUT OF HERE, IF I WANTED TO GO TO UNI, WELL, OF COURSE I DO. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST... WHY DO YOU THINK? I THINK... JESUS CHRIST. RUBY. - AH, LET ME... - SHH. MY PARENTS WILL HEAR. YOU SHOULD FOLLOW ME. I SHOULD GO. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE, FOLLOW ME. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU. DADDY WANTS YOU DEAD, BUT... I MADE A VERY BIG DECISION. I WANT YOU TO BE MY FIRST. WHAT? I DON'T... I CAN'T... IT'S ELFIE, ISN'T IT? NO. WELL... YES. I'LL DECAPITATE THAT TART. WHOA, CALM DOWN. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THIS. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT... BUT YOU WERE JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER BOYS. PARKER, OPEN UP. LOOK... I'VE BEEN THINKING... MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST DUST OUT OF THIS TOWN. IT'S... IT'S NOT SAFE. PARK... DYLAN, PLEASE. UH, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME. MR. PARKER, IS DYLAN NOT HERE? HE'S GONE. HE LEFT US A NOTE. HE, UH, SAID HE WANTED TO DO A BIT OF TRAVELING BEFORE HE STARTS UNI NEXT YEAR. THE, UH... THE GAMMONS SORTED IT OUT. NO, IT'S NOT TRUE... TAKES A BIG MAN TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS LIFE. AH, HE CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. OH, SORRY TO STOP YOU. LISTEN, ELFIE. UH, THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS ABOUT YESTERDAY. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME RIGHT NOW. I DO. LOOK, THIS TIME, YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU FREAK. FREAK. WELL, THAT'S A LAUGH, COMING FROM YOU. COME ON, NOW, THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT RUBBISH. SHUT UP. I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT, ELFIE. I THOUGHT WE HAD A CONNECTION THAT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. YOU THOUGHT WRONG. I THINK IT'S TIME TO ARRANGE A LITTLE TRIP FOR YOU, LIKE THE ONE DYLAN'S ON. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM? - W-WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? - TASTY. MIKE, WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT? OH, GOD, NO WONDER YOUR SON'S SO PATHETIC WITH A WIMP LIKE YOU AS THE FATHER. ELFIE! HELLO, HARRY. HELLO, SUSANNAH. - HELLO. - HI. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE I, UM, WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR ELFIE'S BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY. OH, NO, NO, NO. THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. ELFIE WAS SPOT ON. CLEVER GIRL YOU HAVE THERE. SHE FIGURED IT OUT QUICKER THAN... - THAN ANYONE, REALLY. - RIGHT. WHAT ELSE... OH, SHE SAID WE WERE CANNIBALS. I HATE THAT WORD. IT'S SO ARCHAIC AND VULGAR. I MEAN, THERE ARE VEGETARIANS, VEGANS. WE'RE NO DIFFERENT. WELL, OUR TASTES MIGHT BE PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE EXOTIC. YOU SHOULD REALLY LISTEN TO YOUR KIDS. HARRY. GET OUT OF HERE. I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU TOUCH MY DAUGHTER. OH, SOMEONE'S FOUND THEIR MANHOOD AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO ENJOY THIS. ELFIE. WHERE'S DYLAN? YOU'RE TOO LATE. HE'S ALREADY DEAD. FOR A SKINNY GUY, HE WAS QUITE TASTY. I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN KILLING. POPS. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY SON? OH. OH, DYLAN. YOU'RE ALIVE. MUAH, MUAH. GET AWAY FROM HIM, YOU SLUT. TAKE IT EASY, BUNNY BOILER. HE LOVES YOU. WHY? DO YOU LOVE HIM? IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU, HE WOULD LOVE ME. SORRY, DOLLFACE, BUT IT'S JUST NOT GONNA PLAY OUT THAT WAY. HE'S MINE. AH! AH! OW! EASY THERE, CHARLIE. YOU KILLED MY FAMILY. YOU KILLED MY PARENTS. I UNDERESTIMATED YOU. I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL HAUNTED BY THE FACT YOU GOT YOUR MOTHER KILLED. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, CHARLIE. I'M GONNA ENJOY THIS. EVERY SINGLE LAST FUCKING MORSEL. YOU'RE A FUCKING LUNATIC. I TRIED TO HELP YOU. I GAVE YOU YOUR BIGGEST CASE. YOU ARE NOTHING WITHOUT ME. I MADE YOU. SO ARE YOU READY TO GO? YEAH. SO DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE AN ITEM? SHUT UP, PARKER.
