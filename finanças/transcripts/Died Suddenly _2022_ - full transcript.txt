Jewish life insurance companies have reported an overwhelming and unexplainable increase, in all-cause deaths among 18 to 49 year olds. Along with that, there's also been an increase in certain medical diagnoses, such as miscarriages and Bell's palsy. Well, when I first started seeing these, this these strange anomalies in the blood, it's just there's something different about the blood. All of these people that were dying, it doesn't matter what they died of .. They were having this unique .. uh .. There's this unique change in the blood. I feel as though I am seeing something .. that could be causing their deaths. No one will see what I see. So in the very beginning I'm thinking .. okay so Covid could have caused this possibly, But now, I'm seeing these, in people that supposedly never had Covid. And then you find out they were vaccinated. And so it's like: okay so .. if the vaccine may be causing that. I want people to understand, that we're in a 5th generation warfare ... They now shape the news openly ... to manipulate and deceive .. the American population it seems ! .. weapons of mass destruction ... .. if you don't believe in any conspiracy there ? Jane, what more can you tell us about ... the Sullivan office building that's collapsed ? Microsoft ... .. and then we're injecting them in little kids' arms ... .. a 19 year old heath care worker has developed blood clots, after ... .. the controversies of big foot .. .. just days after getting their second Covid-19 vaccine, that two teenage boys died in their sleep ... .. oh my God ! .. A 9 year old went to sleep in Eagle Mountain and never woke up .. school cheerleader who died suddenly .. Who knows .. Young people are dying instead ... You know, Matt and I are constantly talking about Malthusian theory ... Malthusian theory, I know, I .. it says it on one of these coffee cups I was given. You know, when I grad .. when I was at junior College Chabot Junior College we finished a history course, and the professor wrote up you need to learn this word he wrote up the word "triage." which represented I was told the concept that eventually, the world will have too many people in it. in order to subsist on it's own, and that stuck with me for a long time, and that's what "Inferno" was about, a ..a .. the quantum physics of overpopulation, in um .. in an instant .. there could be too many people on the planet Earth, and actually the math does add up. Just give us a 20 second definition of Malthusian theory. .. There you go .. Well, that's what I'm built for ... I .. Thomas .. Robert .. Malthus Admitted I knew the service of stating the obvious fact. The demographics of our situation .. equal .. death ! Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus .. was a British demographer, of the late 1700's, and was the first to popularize the idea, that there are simply too many people, using up too much resources ... How many cars, stereos, fancy bars ... ? How many people could the world support ? Well .. it depends .. it's a sliding scale ! Malthusian ideology is often summarized in the following graph: Very simple graphs, which predict what's going to happen to the planet over the next 150 years, if we don't do something drastic to stop it. It's an ideology, an eschatology. Here we concieve a chart that looks at the total world population over the last several hundred years and at first glance, this is a bit scary and it spawned a new genre of fear, that lasted for generations. The fear, of overpopulation. You have to get the death rate and birth rate in balance, and there's only two ways to do it. One is to bring the birth rate down. The other is to push the death rate up. If we do not by humane means limit our numbers, then numbers are going to be limited by more famines and shortages. It's .. reaching plain proportions. No intelligent patriotic American family, ought to have more than two children, preferably one. Maybe anybody who's thinking of having a third child, ought to go hungry a week. So, should we have policies that penalize people for having extra kids in the developed world ? So, I do think that we should at least consider it. And this is where people start getting nervous, talking about overpopulation and population issues, because .. they're scared that I'm going to take away their rights to have children. It's the belief in a coming apocalypse, and that it is you and I, who are ushering it in. We're even running out of sand, which may not seem important, but without it you can't make concrete or glass, like for windows. So you can look outside, and see the world ending. Uh, the world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. Well common sense would tell you, if you have a man standing in front of you, saying he's going to reduce the world's population by 10 or 15 percent using vaccines .. What does that mean to you ? It means somebody's going to die because you put a vaccine in them. It doesn't mean you're going to save people. Uh, that's pretty much common sense in my brain. And .. but yet I saw him, I saw him say it .. he said it .. uh and .. here we are I don't know. I .. I'm just .. here we are ! I'm now an anti-vax or I wasn't before .. uh, from what I've learned here with this .. and seeing what I've seen. Not just in the funeral home but .. you know .. what everybody else has had an opportunity to see ... Uh, I don't want to take any vaccine .. because I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry. I mean, I .. I just buried someone recently who .. who died suddenly .. wasn't sick .. Person in their sixties, but otherwise was not sick .. and .. uh, I met with the family .. and .. um .. that was my first question was: What happened to him ? Somebody mentioned to go on to Google .. and then type in "died suddenly" and find the news articles that would pop up. And lo and behold, here's a whole listing of people. Of articles of people, within that last week who .. died suddenly .. younger people .. Older people, but a lot of younger people throughout .. around the world. Famous people ... Athletes .. have just dropped dead ! Without explanation ! And it's like: it's just .. no big deal ... It's like: we just don't know ... Uh .. it happened, but no it's not happened .. it's never happened .. like this until now. A phone goes up .. I'm trying to make sure I don't miss something. I'm hoping .. I'll do that .. uh .. You can get one of those important calls. See .. this is both from carotid and veins. Uh, I've got to fix that thing ... It's very similar .. it came out of, apparently I've got some of this from a carotid artery .. and also some veins .. so ... back around .. November of last year of 2021 .. people were asking me, well .. How many people are having these strange clots ? And I didn't have a very good answer for it, so .. and starting in November, I started making notations of whether or not the person was .. um .. clotted or not, or .. vaccinated. My green, is people that have been verified are vaccinated. Yellow typically, is somebody that has smaller clots and the orange, is somebody that had more significant clots, the clots that are really kind of concerning to me. I have it dated for the quart .. I mean numbered by the quarter so the entire quarter .. I had about one hundred and thirty .. Yeah only thir.. almost fourteen percent .. had no significant clotting. Um, a lot of the substances that I'm seeing are stuff that looks .. pretty much .. is this white fibrous stuff. Now instead of calling them blood clots .. I try to refer to them as white fibrous clots or white fibrous structures. How come all of a sudden .. these things are happening in so many people ? When I first started seeing these strange, uh, clots .. Uh, in the beginning I thought .. You know, this is kind of weird, it's kind of crazy .. I don't understand. As I started gathering more and more photographs, I'm able to share it amongst other people that I work with. I talked to other embalmers that have thirty, forty, even fifty years of experience. I'm a licensed funeral director, and national board funeral director and certified embalmer. Um, I've been in the death care industry since1982. I've been embalming .. been in the embalming process with well over 1000 bodies .. and I had actually noticed some of the differences in the clots as well .. in some of the bodies I had been embalming. And that had started recently, First on .. first time I saw it .. first time pulled out of a deceased .. my end .. was about 3 months ago. I've been struggling to embalm people for around about .. 18 months. My embalmer was complaining, that he was having trouble getting fluid .. through people. And the way they do that, is they cut into the um, carotid artery and they pump it around the body .., via a pump. He was struggling to get it through and we kind of thought, well maybe the pump wanted servicing, and I'd looked at it .. it doesn't. Pulled this out, and it kind of grabbed the end of my tweezers .. and this comes out in one piece, one elastic piece It looks like .. um .. Calamari. Longest one that I have on video, is probably almost three foot long .. (ca. 1 m) which is incredible to come out of this, you know, the jugular .. up here .. it's, it's incredible. That .. is not .. normal ! I talked to other embalmers that have thirty, forty, even fifty years of experience. I said: hey, you know, have you guys ever seen this stuff before ? And the answer was always: I haven't seen clots like these. Um, these long white fibrous .. different .. they're not blood clots but they're .. they're clotting the blood, so therefore you have to call it a clot. I have been in this profession actually, for approximately twelve years, and approximately 200-250 bodies per year, and I have never seen anything like this .. until the vaccinations. You know, I've been an embalmer, forty one years .. forty one years of being an embalmer, and I've never seen .. clots like these. Here's a guy .. messaged me the other day .. He even sent me a picture. And that's a fellow embalmer ? This is not mine, this is his. Same stuff ... You see that ? You know .. we know something's going on. Um, I, I deal with a lot of funeral directors, and embalmers. Um, I attend national conventions, state conventions, I'm very involved. And, you know .. we know something different is going on. We don't know exactly what's going on. But the timing of it, is just hand in hand. We're connecting dots here. Um, and it certainly appears, that there is some relationship to the vaccine, and these obstructions that we're seeing. I was in Ohio last week, or the week before last, and there were a hundred embalmers at the Ohio embalmers association .. in my lecture and I.. I .. I post these photos up where people could see them ... And nearly .. all of the embalmers, out of 100 in this room, raised their hands, that they had seen clots and white fibrin structures of that kind of size. And when I asked again, when did they start seeing them. Again it's a ... A sixteen to eighteen month period ... This is different, this is .. and they need to figure out what it is. That's the problem .. is they need to figure out .. that's why we're, we're, we're tell .. we're talking to you. Is that we're concerned .. for humanity. Once I knew what was happening, I'm a .. man of principle ... you know, your family's just as important as mine. what, what if .. and if I don't speak out .. we' re off .. anyway ... As a Canadian embalmer, I have found, that everybody I embalmed for over a year .. had .. fiber .. mass .. clots. The fibermass clots .. had .. been fed .. by blood clots at the ends .. that were integrated into the fibermass clots. The fibermass clots themselves .. were not blood clots. On average, I would embalm .. a body every day or two. Every single body had them, and they were massive ! When I was talking to Doctor Ken Thorpe, he was more concerned, about the real tiny clots that he called micro clots. And when I ask them about microclots, it sounds like Let me .. let me explain. Sometimes when I'm seeing the blood, it looks like the blood is dirty. Almost like it has little fine grains of sand, or almost like fine grains of coffee ground. The reason why he's more concerned about those is because they will go undetected, and they can get lodged up in capillaries and end up slowly starving organs, of .. of the oxygen that it needs. Um, so what I did .. I did is, I captured some blood, that looked dirty. It's clotting it up, but see, I wanted you to see the specs that are floating around .. here we go, it looks like rust .. it does ... They get .. look at it .. like see .. you can almost see that they're like .. stringy looking. The first time I've seen something that .. what I would describe, as a different type of blood than I have ever seen .. consistency of blood .. was on a younger lady, that was in a car accident. And, I noticed onto the table as we were getting .. a little bit of drainage from her, that her blood looked as if it was .. I can only describe it as "blood on beach sand." It was sticking to the table. I began noticing strange things with the blood looking like it had coffee grinds or sand in it. To .. complete separation. Like a clear, orange-ish fluid. And then clots coming later, like the blood had almost separated. And of course, then there are the .. Fibrin structures that we get, and it doesn't matter if it's a .. young or old person. Like, you do kind of feel ... Yeah, you can kind of hold on .. it's like a rubber band almost .. Yeah ! Like a rubber band .. or like calamari ... So, of course that explains .. people's stroking out, like .. And that was my concern in the very beginning of all this. The whole thing was, as I'm seeing .. all of these strange clots. I'm hearing stories of .. of blood clots and .. and embolisms and .. and sudden heart attacks. Scientists say there has been an increased rise, a sharp rise in unexplained deaths during the pandemic. Deaths that are not listed, as Covid related. I would just like to find answers, because so many people .. young .. young people are just .. dropping dead. there were two in the local paper today, out of Lafayette, Indiana. And I question how did they die ? Autopsies are not being done and performed. Um .. as often and as frequent .. as it had been done in the past. You know, there's no way that um .. that type of obstruction would not .. um cause stroke, heart failure, um, some type of pulmonary embolism .. um, that would certainly take someone out. Now, most of the people are not autopsied. Therefore .. no one will see what I see ! And that's why .. what we see back there .. People need to know ! they, they .. but nobody will know .. .. unless we tell them .. what we're seeing ! Because it happens, and then you have a visitation and a burial .. and it's over ! I feel as though I am seeing something, that could be causing their death. And .. the dead can't speak for themselves. So therefore, the only way to bring this forward, this is like .. I have to speak for them. Since the vaccine .. this rubbery stuff ? This .. this stuff here, is absolutely .. Oh, hold on .. I don't know who this is ... Hello ... Yes ... Okay ... I'll be there as soon as I can .. um .. I'll be there as soon as I can, I'll give you a call shortly. Alright ... Bye ... Okay ... Well, looks like I gotta go to work .. So .. maybe you guys can come with me, and uh .. we can talk along the way. What are the chances they will let us shoot ? Um .. I've been trying to warm people up to the idea of doing it, um ... So maybe we just go ahead, and try to go up there, and I'll give them a call as we're on our way, and see what they say. Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Theresa Long. And I've been invited here today to testify, to the truth before the legislators of Idaho. The information I'm presenting, is made as a protected communication, under Title 10 USC §1034 as a whistleblower. My opinions are my own, and do not reflect that .. of the United States army, the DOD, or any entity thereof ... Insurance companies figure, that if there were something catastrophic, that happened to the United States, they would see a ten percent increase .. in all-cause morbidity, mortality .. ten percent. First, in just like an unprecedented catastrophic .. you know, natural event or something that happened in the United States. U.S. life insurance companies have reported an overwhelming and unexplainable increase in all-cause deaths among 18 to 49 year olds. Forty percent .. is .. No one's even .. no one's even .. calculated that ! I mean .. that .. that's never been .. uh factored into what things would look like. It's apocalyptic ! In my 15 years as a Doctor taking care of soldiers, I have never seen this litany, of debilitating and potentially deadly medical conditions .. in soldiers. These conditions included: Strokes, transient ischemic attacks, pericarditis, myocarditis, erratic heart rates, arrhythmias, rapid onset and progression of various cancers to include testicular cancer, esophageal cancer, brain tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, spinal tumors, thyroid dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, persistent severe insomnia, suppression of the immune system, unprovoked blood clots in the splenic and portal vein, avascular necrosis, liver dysfunction, menstrual irregularities .. and miscarriages. While I think if you look at the 5.3.6 postmarketing analysis report, the 1291 adverse events .. I don't think those came as diagnostic tests. I think they came as confirmatory tests. You ordered a product. You wanted the product to kill people. Hey stockholders, we got exactly what you ordered ! .. fourth shot, Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer yes ... good for CBS, good for Walmart, good for your health. When I reached out to Army Public Health Command, and numerous senior medical, and operational leaders, about my safety concerns, I was ignored. Threats against my career were made. But no appropriate actions were taken, to fully investigate the number and scope of adverse medical events after Covid vaccines. What I was here today to speak about truly was a weaponization of public health. Oh I forgot to mention: I'm also a whistle blower. That's my .. That person .. That person right there called me one day. I called her .. I can't remember if it was an email ... And she said: "Have you seen the DMED system ?" Have you seen what it sounds .. And I'm like: I'm working on the border .. I'm trying to stop 12'000 people from coming across this border a week. She said we'll take a look at it. Seeing the DMED data .. I have .. I have significant concerns, that we won't have a standing army .. in .. 5 years. Case 1-01, a United States Air Force A-10 instructor pilot, mid 30 year old male, hospitalized 12 hours after vaccination. Diagnosed with pericarditis anaphylaxis removed from flight status for 6 months, thus negatively impacting unit mission readiness. I've never felt so abandoned by the military. I have been forced, to take something that brought me close to my death. I was mocked, discredited, unsupported. Our squad and morale was ripped to shreds. All these things were completely unnecessary. We're truly .. less ready on multiple levels. I had to talk to a wife .. of a soldier that had a stroke, which required speech rehab for several months, and talked to her, while he was in the ICU .. and say to her .. he's going to be ok, and he'll be able to serve again .. cause it's what he loved to do. Back in September 2021, I submitted an affidavit in the Robert D. Austin case, in which I outlined, how the DOD was violating its own risk management process, in their push to mandate the vaccine of every member of the armed forces with an experimental vaccine. After my testimony was made public, the DOD made no effort to investigate my safety concerns. I got contacted by attorney Tom Renz over the weekend, who represents some whistleblowers within the DOD. I have declarations from all three: This State is under penalty .. uh, this is under penalty of perjury. We intend to submit this to the courts. Uh, we have substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriages increased by 300 percent, over the five year average .. almost. Uh, we saw an almost 300 percent increase in cancer over the five year average. Cancer is not being talked about .. except for by Doctor Ryan Cole, thank you Doctor ! He was the first pathologist in the world to say: "Guys ..we're seeing an uptick in cancers." That's: the toxic spike protein has so many mechanisms that allow cancer to wake up, and certain cancer genes that it binds to .. and promotes mechanisms. Everywhere I go, radiologists, interventional radiologists, oncologists, cancer surgeons, like I met today, cancer, cancer, cancer, 30 year olds, twenty year olds, forty year olds .. reactivated or .. second shot, third shot a month later .. breast cancer, stage 4 everywhere. We saw .. this one's amazing .. neurological. So, neurological issues which would affect our pilots. Over a thousand percent increase ! A thousand !! Ten times, that's ten times rate, and obviously that .. rose .. 83'000, 82'000 per year, to 863'000 in one year. Our soldiers are being experimented on .. injured, and sometimes possibly killed. Uh, Senator Johnson, looked in the camera and said: The Department of Defense, the Biden administration is on notice. They must preserve these records, and this must be investigated. And within 24 hours, that system, that is run by the Defense Health Agency, was shut down. This is the bottom line up front. This is the weaponization of our healthcare system. These are done, in acts by legislators. These all started a long time ago. Some could say, in biblical times .. with good and evil. If we think that there's not nefarious actors in the world, people, that work for principalities and dark places. If we think that, we're fooling ourselves, right ? Because that's where we're at. In 1974,Henry kissinger put out a paper that said: "We need to decrease the world population." And that's when the globalists kicked in ... We've got to .. stabilize the population, When I was born .. So what's wrong with the population ? I mean .. we're too many people ! That's what, that's why we have global warming We have global warming because too many people are using too much stuff. Our book "Limits to Growth" was the first concrete effort. Using a computer, to look at trends that unfold over decades .. even .. a century. We were trying to understand long term .. physical .. demands on the planet. And, in the 70's we were thinking, that probably the period 2010 to 2030 was when .. the planet would start to encounter limits. Here is what Dr. Meadows' computer shows. Since the year 1900, the earth's resources they're at the top of the chart .. have been steadily used up as population food consumption, and production of goods have soared. Ahead of us, some time after the year 2000, this computer study forsees calamity. Resources drop more steeply .. and food and production follow suit. Population continues to expand for perhaps one more generation, then collapses calamitously, as deprivation takes hold. Now, 11 billion people is still a lot, but the good news is, that the faster we improve health, the faster family size goes down. The world economic forum .. with Klaus Schwab and George Soros, and .. Bill Gates ... they talk about depopulation. They talk about .. um .. all of these .. kind of utopic ideas that they have ... The United Nations sustainable development goals .. of 17 targets we must meet by 2030, to ensure decent life for all on a healthy planet. Right now, it's expected we will fail. One reason for that, is the growth in our global population. We have .. a golden opportunity to seize something good from this crisis. Covid-19 .. also helped, legitimize instruments of control. It's a deep, systemic .. and structural .. restructuring .. of our world. Therefore we have a unique, but rapidly shrinking window of opportunity to learn lessons and reset ourselves in a more sustainable path ... This pandemic has provided, an opportunity for a reset ! This is our chance to accelerate our prepandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems, that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change. Also be clear .. the future is not just happening. The future is filled by us ! Those people definitely have had tremendous influence and sway in this whole .. thing. And that is why they seemingly know, how to hold these events, and almost .. perfectly predict what's going to happen. The event 201 scenario is fictional .. but it's based on public health principles, epidemiologic modeling, and assessment of past outbreaks. An outbreak that circles the globe, and affects people everywhere. In other words we've created a pandemic, that could realistically occur. I know, we would all agree that if we had a vaccine in hand for CAPS .. it'd be a game changer. A majority of Americans expect a vaccine to be available within 2 months, and 65 percent of those polled, are eager to take the vaccine, even if it's experimental ... Vaccinate .. vaccinate .. make an appointment .. Vaccinate .. vaccinate .. make an appointment .. Get that vaccine up in time alive .. When will we get our dose just please hurry .. I got nothing ... and come on vaccine ... Trust in your health care ... Shot it, shot it, shot it, shot it, staying alive, staying alive ... .. time for us to trust and not debate .. the vaccine, believe it's safe, and take it .. .. and we will shoot 500 vials .. .. and we will stick 500 more .. I'm a good time .. and you're the vaccine .. .. stick it .. in me ... And because you are in a war .. because this a 5th generation warfare .. for your hearts and your minds .. done mostly by digits, right through the computer, and those kind of things, but it's also done with adjunct .. weaponry ... and this adjunct weaponry in this case .. is a Covid jab ! They don't want you to know, that your body is now their property and playground. And they will do with you, what they feel like doing to you. And they will destroy your life, if you don't take .. a lethal .. needle in your arm. And it is .. it's the new bullet .. it's the new missile .. it's the new form of warfare. You don't need to fire a bullet and win a war. I wanted people to understand .. that we're in a 5th generation warfare. That generation is for the heart and the mind. The United States government has been engaged in psychological operations on it's own citizens for over 60 years. "Mkultra" and "operation mockingbird" are just two of the declassified programs designed to manipulate the minds of Americans in the world. The majority of these operations occur in plain sight, with the purpose of gas lighting, and undermining those who seek the truth, and pose a threat to the agenda of the global elite. Just kidding, you conspiracy theorists .. the government would never lie to you .. thank you .. Read .. my .. lips ... Cause uh, we got a call, regarding you coming over here multiple times, and it seems, like they don't want to talk to you. Uh, well now it seems that way, because she called the police on me .. Ok .. You should always be suspicious. If the people in charge of safety .. don't want to see the safety data. That should be a red flag ! I couldn't understand why .. people aren't looking at this data. Even the clinical trial .. for the Pfizer vaccine .. showed .. that the vaccine killed more people .. than in the placebo group. It's supposed to be the other way around. So, what, what's your name. My name is Steve Kirsch Steve Kirsch ? Yes ! .. Ok .. Where do you work, where you work ? I, I .. I'm a journalist for Substack .. Substack ? ... Yeah. I've got .. close to a million followers on Substack. So I've been called a .. an anti-vaxxer. I've been called a misinformation spreader. MIT has labeled me a misinformation superspreader. And in fact, if you go Google .. you type in "misinformation superspreader" I'm the top hit in the entire world. Why am I labeled a misinformation superspreader ? I have no, history at all, of being a conspiracy theorist. How do I go from being .. Hey, you should get vaccinated .. waving the flag to: "I love Tony Fauci" To saying: Wow, we've been lied to. How did that happen ? I was vaccinated, in march of 2021 .. my wife was vaccinated, and all my kids were vaccinated. So, you couldn't .. call me an "anti-vaxxer." I've always gotten all these vaccines, that the government has recommended. I've always trusted the government. And then, I started hearing stories from my friends. So, one person said that: "She asked me if the vaccines were safe, and I said: Of course they're safe." And I said: why are you asking me this question ? I mean like: Have you not turned on the news .. like .. where have you been ? She said: "Well, three of my relatives .. were vaccinated, and they died a week later, and, they were all perfectly healthy .. before they got the vaccine. And I said: "Oh, that's impossible. that must be wrong .." and .. and .. like .. and .. and then she replied: "Um ..Yeah, but they're dead." "Is it really safe, and is it really effective ?" These vaccines are safe. They are incredibly effective .. vaccines .. are safe .. and effective ... Getting a booster, different from your original vaccination is likely safe and effective ... But if there's one message .. that needs to cut through all this. The vaccines are safe. I promise you .. they are safe and effective. Researchers have confirmed that the Oxford Astra Zeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective. . .How I'm left after a seizure .. . . . .But this is safe & effective, right ? Surprisingly .. most people don't want to know what's in the vaccines. In fact nobody wants to know what's in the vaccines because .. nobody in Congress is asking to analyze the vials. Nobody in the mainstream media has ever asked .. what's in the vials ? And the public doesn't want to know either because the public's not asking what's in these vaccines. If people understood what was in the vaccine, they'd go apeshit ! Uh, the first one is a typical, um .. package insert that we see with any vaccine. When you open the box, next to the vial you find a package insert that um .. has information about what the product contains. And, this is a typical vaccine insert .. from a, um .. a vaccine that helps protects against meningitis. It's a more traditional childhood vaccine And, the .. other label that I'm going to show you, the other package insert came from a box of mRNA product ... So, a vaccine that was um, brought to the clinic for the purpose of giving that to children. And this should look the same as the other package insert that I showed you. But yet, when we open it, almost two years into this .. we find that it still says "intentionally blank." And it, I mean, they're, they're allowed to, under emergency authorization, to put anything in them they want, and the FDA isn't inspecting any of these so it's .. the European medicines agency allowed .. the purity to go from 100% requirement down to 50%. And then all of a sudden in the middle of the shot rollouts you hear: "Oh, okay, we don't have to worry about this cold chain. So now you've got degrading products, which probably benefited some people, in the sense, that they broke down so fast, that they got physically some mushy fat and sludge and dodged the bullet. But the ones who got the proper dose at the proper temperature, are probably the ones that got harmed the most. I mean, how much do they care, they're making billions ... The mRNA was at a cross, but we had less experience, only 2 years working on this, and actually, mRNA was a technology that never delivered a single product .. until that day. Not that I've seen, not any other medicine. So, uh, so it was very counterintuitive and I was surprised when they suggested to me that this is the way to go .. .. Steve Crist by the way, has a great offer out there for your listeners. I don't know if you know about this .. No .. His offer is: anybody, from any major academic medical center, or any government agency, who will come to the table, and have a fair discussion on vaccine safety and efficacy. He'll pay him two million dollars. Anybody ? I offered a million dollars not .. not to win the debate. Just to come to the table: a million dollars, and when they refused the million dollars .. I said ok .. name your price. is it 5 million .. 10 million .. 100 million. What will it take, for us to have a civil .. a discussion .. on the record. On the record on recording .. where we can go through the evidence .. in the VAERS system, and other pieces of data. So that we can have an open discussion about this. So the VAERS is a voluntary reporting system. and it was created this way. Because the drug companies negotiated with the government to say. The government said, we will give you .. liability protection .. for your vaccines. but the quid pro quo is, that we're going to establish this vaccine adverse event reporting system. Which of course they could have done anyway. We have the VAERS system in the United States. The system in Israel was even worse. In March, these researchers came to the Israeli ministry of health and said. Hey, we've got a problem here ! Basically they're told, that the vaccines are killing and hurting people. And you're withholding that information from the Israeli people. So the latest Israeli vaccination studies are out and Steve Kirsch says the results prove government was lying all along about the frequency of adverse events from covid shots .. shudder ! I sent an email to over .. 200, close to 300 people at the CDC asking, if any of them .. wanted to see the data. Okay .. almost 300 people. Not a single person wanted to see the data at the CDC. Still, I have the personal cell phone for Grace Lee, who is the chair of the ACIP committee, which is the outside committee of the CDC. I asked, if she wanted to see the data. She ignored me. Did they explicitly tell you no, or did they just ignore you ? No ! ... No, they just ignore me. Have you been in this house before ? Um .. I have yeah. And, and this uh ? Yeah .. it's a letter to contact her ... Cause of this .. she's not reachable. She's not reachable in her office she doesn't answer her cell phone. Said .. her assistant doesn't answer .. doesn't answer her email ... That committee .. is responsible for approving and being the .. outside independent source .. for .. approving these vaccines. How, how did the ACIP recently come to the decision to recommend Covid-19 shots for this latest group of young kids, and what kinds of things were you looking for in the data ? Uh, we got a call regarding you coming .. over here, multiple times, and it seems like they don't want to talk to you. Well now, it seems that way, because she .. she called the police on me. You know, I think we need to recognize, that Covid-19 is here to stay. That .. that vaccines are .. make for a safer, and more reliable way to develop immunity against infections ... But now, it's very clear that she's actively avoiding the question of whether she wants to see the Israeli data .. that shows, the vaccines are not safe. That's pretty serious ! Yeah, well, it looks like she's not interested, so ... How in the world .. could anyone .. especially .. that top person in the world responsible for safety, not want to see the safety data, that shows. that the vaccines are not safe ? They don't want to be confronted .. with even the question: do you want to see the data ? They want to have plausible deniability. Was .. the Pfizer Covid vaccine ... tested .. on stopping the transmission of the virus .. before .. it entered the market ? Did we know about stopping immunization, before it entered the market ? No ! Pfizer vaccine not only stops people from getting sick, but also stops them from spreading the virus to other people. One vaccine could curb virus transmission, from just a single dose ... .. for stopping people also, from transmitting the disease And the chances are very likely, that you'll not be able to transmit it to other people Yes, it will protect you, but honestly, it's not for you, it's .. so you don't kill other people it's .. so you don't spread it .. to other people. One hundred and fourteen million Americans, nearly half the adult population in this country, has had a vaccine shot already. One hundred and fourteen million of us have had it. The number of people who have died from getting the shot is zero. There are about 14'000 Americans, who have, uh, reported deaths. Now .. that's probably under reported by a factor of one hundred. So you take the fourteen thousand .. deaths that are reported in the VAERS system, you multiply by one hundred ... Yeah: 1.4 million !! But the deaths that happen five months later .. And that's the bulk of 'em .. are not going to get reported .. in the VAERS system. An elderly woman has died, in what's believed to be south Australia's first case of fatal blood clotting caused by the Astra Zeneca Covid vaccine. Investigation is underway tonight over whether a local man suffered blood clots as a result of getting the Pfizer vaccine. Two teachers who where at Sowams Elementary School for more than 20 years, and passed away suddenly this school year. Therapeutic goods administration is calling for calm, following the deaths of two people in our State, who received the Covid vaccine. And Woodgrove High School student athlete Colette Baine passed away unexpectedly, after a medical emergency. A 20 year old nursing student died of cardiac arrest, one day after getting the mandatory ... The 16 year old had a cardiac arrhythmia ... A High school cheerleader who died suddenly ... .. informations are that the death of a woman from blood clots after receiving the Covid vaccine ... A Cleveland man died in intensive care tonight ... .. suffering a blood clot after receiving his Astra Zeneca vaccine... .. and in spite of the weather, a local man suffered blood clots as a result ... .. due to a blockage in an artery ... With medical experts confirming, the death of a central coast woman, is likely linked to the jab ... I said you're just .. We're just going to have to get used to this. And he says: "The shots ?" ... And now he says: "Yeah we're just going to have to get used to this. This is the way it is." "If you keep .. if people keep doing this, then, this is going to keep happening." The vaccine can kill you two different ways. It can kill you in the short term. Now, there's a longer term effect, and this takes 5 months to kill you. And this is when your veins are basically clogged up, with this uh, protein uh, material .. it's amyloid protein material, that's not blood clots. Now .. the timing of when the embalmers first started seeing these blood clots: mid 2021 So many miles on my car you know. You know it seems like half of my time .. is driving from one funeral home to another. The busiest I ever was, to be honest, was January of 2021. Now I didn't even think about it being related to the vaccine at all, at the time. Looking back, I say: no wonder they died .. of a heart attack or a stroke or a .. some kind of a pulmonary embolism. Because .. you can't live with this stuff in you .. .. probably do about 160 funerals a year. So I've been waiting for a young person that died suddenly. Who'd also had a post-mortem. And then, the family had asked me to embalm so there were three planets .. that needed to align .. and this poor guy uh .. he was full of it. It was hanging out, and floods the gate .. This one here came out of the aorta, uh, from the heart, and .. if they take the shape of the vessels that they're growing in, early .. and they gradually fill the vessels as they grow ... Um, and these obviously, that there .. that's what's killed him. Hey, I just want to let you know, I'm .. I'm pulling into the Funeral Home here, and I've got some guys that are with me. Are you fine, with me bringing them in ? The following imagery is from actual cadavers, and has not been prepared, altered, or manipulated in any way .. .. this is the iliac artery .. .. and this clot .. coming out .. of the iliac .. Normally we don't see clots .. in the iliac .. .. in an artery .. usually they're in veins .. .. and I'm probably not going to be able to get il all .. .. this is not normal .. .. look at this fiberisch thing .. .. that one came out of a vein .. .. a small one .. came out .. .. of the iliac artery itself .. .. here it is .. wow ! .. look at that .. As, the months passed by, the clots became worse, and each person, um, the quantity of them .. was much larger .. and .. they were getting larger. We were doing, an injection and drainage into .. the common aortic artery and we were getting fluid in. And then, all of a sudden it just stopped we could not get any more fluid in, we were not getting any drainage of any type. .. look at this .. watch out, it's going to squirt .. .. that's a monster .. OMG .. Holy Jesus .. .. come on .. .. oops .. I believe the only way that a Medical Doctor could see this in the body .. is if uh .. they actually went internally into the body. .. so this is coming out of a beating heart. Look at this. Tell me if it looks the same way. "John" has been injured by two doses of Pfizer vaccine. So good for you to come in today, it's good to see you .. Thank you Doc .. So, I'm excited to get this thermal imaging scan. But before we do that I want to learn a little bit more about your medical history. Tell me, when this all started .. These symptoms that you have .. Early August this year I um .. my legs started swelling. I was getting a lot of pain .. from the crotch area all the way down to the .. ankle. They did a Doppler on it, and I had several clots in my leg .. Oh wow ... So I was transported to the hospital, and they confirmed that .. and also, that I had a clot in my lungs. So you went into the hospital. They put you on a blood thinner presumably. Yes I got put on Eliquis*, when I was being released. (*Apixaban, anticoagulant) And uh .. come to find out, the Eliquis did not work for me .. OK .. And it did they let you know, that that is extremely rare ? Every doctor I saw, said it was extremely rare. Which side did you get the shot in ? Which arm ? I think it was both. Do you think it could have been the left for both of them, cause you got two right ? Yes, it could have been the left .. Cause the left arm definitely looks, um, much, it has a much higher thermal signal than the right .. Yes .. So we can see, the left side of this face has a much stronger thermal image and then the white is also extremely hot. And this is in the area of the um pre- and postauricular loop adenopathy chain. Um, and then the tonsil area is also very well lit up. Submandibular, submental. The left side was the one where he has confirmed clots. The right side here is showing, um .. significant issues with the vascular system so I would recommend referring for an ultra sound, lower extremities, bilaterally, to rule out any kind of new clotting or venous obstructions. Michelle Gershon is a whistle blower RN from the post partum ward of a major hospital in Fresno, CA. Hello .. Hi Michelle, this is Nick and Matthew .. How are you ? .. Can get ... So, before the vaccines came out, there were one to two fetal demises ... Every two or three months, you would see one. Intrauterine fetal demise (also called stillbirth) occurs whan a child dies in the womb at or after the 20th week of pregnancy. Prior to 2021, it was extremely uncommon. I finally had enough, when I got this email the other day. It said, that there was a record number of fetal demises, and that there were twenty two of them .. in one month ! In this email it said, that it's projected to increase each month. The fetal demise in mothers, gestational mothers in that twenty two to twenty six week period. I had a run of that, at my funeral home. Um .. and .. Five of the six were vaccinated, the other had .. Remdesivir ... And .. uh .. they all lost their infants. We're just seeing a fridge, full of babies .. but we're not actually doing the funeral so that's um .. it's a mystery to me, is the weird way these babies are going. So, are you saying there's more fetuses in the refrigerators now, than there was, prior to 2021 ? Yeah, I'm saying, there's more fetuses now in .. in the refrigerator than I've seen ever before. I've been doing high risk obstetrics, for 43 years. I see a vast number of patients a year. I don't know of any other maternal fetal medicine physician in this country, that sees as many patients as I do, by ultrasound ... At one point in time this year, I was on track to see nine thousand. Nine thousand high risk ob ultrasounds. So I know what's going on, and I've seen death and destruction like I've never seen before. The stillbirth rate is measured in terms of live births per thousand. And really, it's come down in my career, from about 10 to about, almost 5.8 or 6 ... Now let's go to 2021, and look at the stillbirth rate for Michelle's. This is horrifying ! But if you take this death figure and you look at that rate at 29.3 ... that sigma that you're looking at .. is 40+ sigma standard deviation. Let that sink in ... This is from Waterloo Canada, Eighty three stillbirths. About four thousand deliveries. That exact same thing you saw with Michelle's. If that weren't bad enough. Look at this ... I couldn't even put it .. There were 13 dead fetuses, in one 24 hour period. One twenty four hour period. .. 1200 fold increases in menstrual abnormalities, and then, when we get into pregnancy, we're looking at a substantial increase .. in miscarriages, and birth defects, a substantial risk of fetal cardiac arrhythmia, fetal cardiac malformations, significant fetal growth slowing, significant reduction in amniotic fluid, fetal cardiac arrest. Are you saying, babies are having heart attacks in the womb ? Yes !! The vaccine causes a significant inflammatory effect. Three different safety monitoring systems: Again, they found no significant safety signals for the mother, or for the fetus because, we have to remember in obstetrics, we're dealing with two patients. So no increased risks, to be vaccinated while pregnant. Anything that causes inflammation .. in my business .. in my area of expertise .. causes damage, injury, death and destruction in pregnancy. We've known that for half a century. On March 1st, the FDA released the first round, of thousands of pages of data, submitted by Pfizer for review of their Covid-19 vaccine. It's the 5.3.6 post-marketing analysis of the adverse events, in which they outlined, that 83 percent of all pregnant women who got vaccinated ended up with a dead baby. They had 270 pregnancies. They could not account for what happened to 238 of those pregnancies, and the remaining pregnancies resulted in a dead baby. And they only had one normal outcome. And originally the documents were going to take 55 years to be released, but, because of a court order, we'll get all of the documents by year's end. Thank you for the floor Mr. President. Honorable national assembly .. In January this year, something happened, that has not happened for decades. The birth rate fell by twenty percent, compared to the same period last year. Csaba G. Tóth, researcher at the KRTK Institute of Economics, points out, that this drastic decline came just nine months after the Covid mass vaccinations began in Hungary. Now I will today, a friend of mine she told me this the other day. Her mother had volunteered at the hospital prior to Covid. So they called her and said: Hey, would you come back in and volunteer ? and she volunteered obstetrics, right ? Babies ... So she said: Yeah alright. So they retrained her, and then they called her back and said um: I guess there's no point you coming in .. we're not having any babies born. I never pass up an opportunity when I see a newborn baby. I stop and I drink it in. Because my heart aches to think .. that seeing a newborn baby may become .. one of the rarest things. And, and I want to be wrong ... I hope I'm wrong ... But ... So many people .. have taken this ... There's nothing as close to seeing the face of God as seeing a newborn. And, you have just .. evil .. That is .. is destroying them. And, and ... and my heart hurts for God. Like .. you could give people all of this. And they wouldn't use their time, energy and talents .. to try and destroy it ... What the last two years has taught me .. it's taught me, that there is a pure evil in this world. A pure evil, that has no respect .. um .. for any of us .. where .. I can tell you, we are regarded, um .. in much the same way as livestock. We were trained that the one thing that prevented adversaries from deploying bioweapons, was that, in order for them to have a strategic impact, our enemy would have to have a delivery mechanism, that would allow them to expose a large enough population of people, in a short enough period of time, before the people knew they were being attacked. Dispersion in the air would be cumbersome and ineffective, giving UV light dispersion, wind patterns, and that there are generally not significantly large enough numbers of people outside, concentrated in a small area. Likewise, attempting to put them in water, would have limited effectiveness because of dilution, degradation from chloride, etc ... But what if .. what if hundreds of millions of people would willingly .. or under the duress of fear, allow themselves to be injected with a bioweapon. What if global mass vaccination could be accomplished, in a short period of time by applying relentless coercion tactics, and psychological operations, to demoralize people into submission. It's my professional medical opinion, that this is a bioweapon, and that this was a bioweapon, unleashed .. against humanity .. with the intent to .. depopulate .. and control the population of the world. But basically it's achieving it's goal. If the goal was, to reduce the world's population, it's working. This has been well planned. This is agenda 2030 .. this is the "Great Reset." This is what it's all about you know, so, one of the hardest things, um, knowing what I know, was accepting that people are going to die, because they're just not going to believe it. We have to be the plan ! And that means that each person in this room, Viewing this broadcast. Replaying this broadcast. Each one of you has .. a purpose ! Each one of you has a critical, God given role ! And so if you are quiet .. or apathetic .. or complacent .. you have to stand before God. And you have to answer for that. I can put out a warning, to all the people that are in the military right now. Officers who are responsible for everything that happens or fails to happen with our troops, if you don't stand in the gap .. you're complicit in this crime. If we .. the only way we're going to save our lives, Is by together, clubbing together to do it. That's .. that's our strength, and this is probably, um .. the most biblical world event that anyone could ever imagine. It's a World War 3 .. it's a spiritual war of good against evil, and I just hope .. That .. that there's enough good in the world that we could rally together to defeat it. Because, if we don't ... These monsters will destroy humanity ! Dance baby dance like the world is ending ... Dance baby dance like the world is ending ... Dance baby dance cause the world is ending ... Boom, boom, boom, boom .. Dance baby dance like the world is ending ... Dance baby dance like the world is ending ... Dance baby dance cause the world is ending ... Boom, boom, boom, boom .. Get Vaccinated ! It's incredibly effective ... But the truth is ... Not enough people are getting it ... We got to change that ! ... So we can all .. have a safe and healthy holiday season ... Let me hear it, if you've had the Pfizer vaccine ! Hear it, for Moderna ! Astra Zeneca ! This is .. who you are .. this is .. who you are .. this is .. who you are .. Let us never forget, what they have done ! This is .. who you are .. this is .. who you are .. this is .. who you are .. The people who are not getting vaccines .. who are believing the lies on the Internet .. instead of science ... It's time to start shaming them ! ... If you refuse to be vaccinated, you shouldn't get the same rights .. as people who've been vaccinated .. If you're willing to walk among us unvaccinated ... You are an enemy ! You knew that .. I know that choice doesn't seem so tough to make. A vaccinated person having a heart attack ? Yes, come right on in. We'll take care of you .. Unvaccinated dying .. Gobbled horse goo .. rest in peace squeezy ! Baby walking around, and with your head cut off ... Baby walking around, and with your head cut off ... When are we going to stop putting up with the idiots in this country ... and just say: now, it's mandatory to get vaccinated. ??? ??? freedom, I want my freedom to live. Vaccine .. vaccine .. vaccine .. vaccine ... I'm begging of you .. please don't hesitate. Vaccine .. vaccine .. vaccine .. vaccine ... 'cause once you're dead, and that's a bit too late
