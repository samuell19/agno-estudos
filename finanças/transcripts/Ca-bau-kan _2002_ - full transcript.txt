This story starts with my mother, Siti Noerhajati. She was from Betawi and people called her Tinung. Honey, why did you leave me? - Honey! - His wife is pregnant. - I'm all alone now. - Poor girl. Hey! You witch! You can't do that! Use your head! Don't be an idiot! How dare you?! What do you know? How dare you talk to me like that?! You can't evict people just like that! Do you think my daughter is trash? - There's a way things should be done! - I don't care! Those rules no longer apply! My son died because of her! You will get bad karma for this! You bastard! We will see whether it's me or you who gets bad karma! Piss off! In her despair, my mom lost the baby that she was carrying. Tinung. Tinung. Be patient, Tinung. Okay? Okay? Be patient. Instead of staying at home all the time, you should work like Aunty Saodah. That would be better. That's right. You're still young, Tinung. Many men would be attracted to you. If you get a rich client, all you'll have to do is take off your clothes. Let him enjoy your body. You will get a lot of money. If that rich man likes you, he might want to keep you as his mistress. - Just like what's-her-name. - Atim. Right. Just like Atim. She's a Ca-bau-kan. I came to Jakarta to find the traces of the sinners. I am the daughter of a Ca-bau-kan. Cik Lan. She's beautiful. There she is. - Hi, Saodah. - Hi. - Who is that with you? - My niece. She looks great. - Saodah, you're with me tonight. - Hey! Where have you been? - I've been waiting for you. - They're waiting. Where have you been? In an instant, Tinung got the nickname "Zi Chi Siang," which means popular and most wanted. Hi, love. Help me with this. You're a sweet-talker. I'm shy. - What if I take you with me to Sewon? - For how many nights? I don't know how many nights. At least till I'm bored. How much are you willing to pay her? I will pay more than I used to pay the others. Hurry up! Pay! You bastard! You don't want to pay, huh? - When? - Forgive me, sir! You know what will happen to you if you don't pay? Forgive me, sir! - What's going on here? - This man refuses to pay. Ouch! Forgive me, sir! - Take care of him. Take him over there. - Yes, sir. Let's go! What a scoundrel! You refuse to pay?! Do you want to die? - Ouch! - Pay! You have to pay your debt! Don't tell me that you can't pay! Pay now! How dare you?! Why don't you just admit it?! I will pay you. I promise. How? How will you pay? I can offer you my virgin daughter. Your virgin daughter? What are you talking about? I see you hang out by the market every day! Ouch! How dare you?! Now you know what happens if you don't pay! Pay now! - You bastard! Pay! - Forgive me! When will you pay? You talk too much! That's what you get! That's what you get for not paying your debt! Idiot! All you can do is sleep! Where's Tinung? I don't care! I love her! I want her back here! - Find Tinung! Find her! - Yes, sir. Stupid! Tinung, why don't we go back to Kalijodo? But I'm pregnant. - Nobody would be interested in me. - Nonsense. Hey, Tinung, listen to me. Men are like dogs. Forget a pregnant woman, they'd even date trash. Have a story I am the young lady... - Come on, Tinung. Hurry up. - Yes, Auntie. Run, Tinung! Run! I don't know who you are. Why did you want to kill me? You're crazy, you know that? I taught you Cokek dance and classic songs so you could perform on stages. So you could earn a decent living. You got that? But instead, you became prostitutes in Kalijodo! Yes, sir. Because you don't get a lot of shows. You don't understand? We're having a crisis. Everything is difficult! Next Sunday, I have a show at the Lautze Mosque. You, come with me. - But, sir... - What now? This is Tinung, my niece. Please teach her Cokek dance and songs. What? Pregnant like this? Come on! Let's take it! I only got five! In the afternoon I'm getting closer Taking care of the beautiful one... You sing very nicely. Who is this pregnant woman? Tinung, my niece. Can you sing too? - Can you sing or not? - Not yet, sir. If you could sing like her, I'd pay you ten times more. Here. Bie. Insane. Who is he actually? He's a Kiau Seng from Semarang. Calm down. Stop it. KONG KOAN ASSEMBLY CHAIRMAN... SEMARANG TYCOON AT PARTY... This painting is an original by by Rembrandt van Rijn. It was owned by Daendels and Ehrenburg. I will start with 100 gulden. Three hundred gulden! Three hundred gulden going once. Do I hear 400? Who? A thousand gulden! By someone who doesn't want to be named. Anyone else? No? A thousand gulden for the mysterious bidder. Hooray! Now, this painting. Iantoro. Iantoro was born in Purworejo. I will start with 100 gulden. Two hundred gulden. Two hundred gulden for you. Who else? Two hundred gulden. From Mr. Mysterious Bidder. It's 1,100 gulden! - Hooray! - Anyone else? Sir? - One thousand five hundred gulden! - Hooray! One thousand five hundred gulden! Who else? Oh my God! Mr. Mysterious Bidder! It's 2,500 gulden! - Wow! - Look! He is Tan Peng Liang! Hooray! SOME DUTCH MASTERPIECES FALL INTO THE OWNERSHIP OF TAN PENG LIANG We should catch that Tan Peng Liang and throw his body into the well. We are the Kong Koan board! We can use that power! And we don't care if he's rigid or flexible! I doubt it. He might have the power to humiliate us. We don't really know much about him. He's only just come from Semarang. We had better find out more about him. We shouldn't let poor judgment or rash action backfire on us. That's absolutely right. It seems like he did it on purpose to insult us. He clearly insulted me! He built his tobacco warehouse close to mine! The board should've taken decisive action against him right from the start! Actually, we already know from Sun Zi's The Art of War that we can't hit someone if that person is too far out of our reach. Why don't we bring him within our reach first? What do you think about offering him a position as a lieutenant in this foundation? He's just a Kiao Seng. That's indeed Sun Zi's strategy. But the appointment of a lieutenant has to be approved by the Dutch government. And right now, the General Governor doesn't want to deal with it. He's pretty much occupied by the resistance from the locals. Can you do that? - No. - Of course not! Silly! Do you think you can memorize a song like that in an instant? That's why you need to learn. You need to practice. Got it? And there are steps to practice too. Got it? Now, stand up. Hurry up! Come on, stand up! Pay attention. You! Batavia nowadays Sunflower seed packets everywhere From home to the market From the cinema to the restaurant People are enjoying sunflower seeds I am not interested in the position that you offer me. I have my own dream. Yes, dear To me Yellow betel, my dear Fell on the ground, my dear The white and yellow one, my dear The white and yellow one, my dear What's her name? Yellow betel, my dear Fell on the ground, my dear The white and yellow one, my dear The white and yellow one, my dear What's her name? - Where is he from? - Maybe he's coming from Glodok. He might be bringing drugs with him! Yes, yes. Thank you. Get on the ground! Thank you, Mr. Inspector. I'm glad you are here. What you did was excellent. My name is Tan Peng Liang, Mr. Inspector. I'm from Semarang, just like your wife. How do you know that my wife is from Semarang? Everybody knows that. - Really? - Yes. Sir, play the Gambang Kromong again to liven up the day. Okay. Awesome. Sail away, O boat, sail away... Bie, that's the woman who was pregnant last time. Tell her we will take her with us. Yes. Don't overlook their service The great heroes Yes, yes, yes Row, row the boat My master is waiting for you. Tinung. Come on, Tinung. He must be a rich guy. This is your opportunity to get his money. I want you to sing only for me. You don't need to sing in front of a lot of people. Just sing for me and I'll pay you double. You don't mind, do you? Come on. Get in. Now, sit down. Come on. It's a nice house, isn't it? Mbok, bring the clothes here. Go and change. But before that, take a shower first. Okay? Go on, take a shower. You smell bad. Tonight, you will sleep here. If you can please me, I might ask you to stay here. Okay? Mbok, please take care of her. Honey. How happy Tinung was, that she'd finally found a man who could respect and accept her and also her first child. That Ca-bau-kan is pregnant now and Dad wants to take her to the Sampokong Temple in Semarang. Let him do that. I am old now. I can no longer please your father. He can't do that, Mom. That's not an excuse. We have to get rid of that Ca-bau-kan! Hoek. Kim Hoek. Don't do that, son. Do you think your dad is soft? Your father is a rock. I'm asking you two not to ruin your father's happiness. Seven. All right. Wow. Your Ciam Si is very good. This means that you will be lucky in finance and in love. Marrying a Chinese man is not easy. Chinese people consider themselves older than the Javanese. So, with the elderly, the younger one has to show respect and obey them. Do you understand that? What's more important is you will not be honored as a woman until you become a mother who has given birth to the children of your husband. So, you have to take good care of your pregnancy. I'm actually disappointed to see your relationship has gone so far without a celebration party. But I have no right to stop the love. Love is God's territory. When the love is true love, it must come from God. Do you really love Peng Liang? I will pray for you in my own way that your love will last. Come on. Be careful. - Mom. - Yes? What do you think of Tinung? Which aspect? Her face. You're silly. If you still care about appearances, then you've not grown as a man. A man who cares only about appearances is a man with a poor soul. One who only sees what he can get from a woman instead of seeing her dignity. Yes, Mom. But love starts from the eyes and then moves down to the heart. That's how a narrow-minded man thinks. When he sees a woman, all he can think about is to get laid. - 'Cause that's important. - But you see that as the only right thing. Not really, Mom. From Tinung, I hope to get a Giok Lan to replace my late Giok Lan. That's your business. I just want to tell you one thing. You bear the sin if Kim San and Kim Hok's mother is neglected... I don't neglect her. She can't do anything anymore, Mom. She's paralyzed. If you are lying, karma will come for you. Those Kong Koan people think they're more important than us. If they challenge us to battle, of course we won't refuse to meet them. You understand that, Bie? - Yes. - Good. I cooperated with foreign parties numerous times, but this is my first time having a partnership with the Dutch East Indies. And I choose you to be my partner. I hope you can give it your best. You've made the right choice. I hope to repay the favor. If the items are good, but the people are not nice, that's like putting a fish in a pond of oil. Am I right? Do you know? I almost got scammed by your neighbor. But fortunately, it didn't happen. You mean Tan Pen Liang? He's a primitive man. - His items are all trash. - Yes. First, he said he could provide me with some rare items like Latakia tobacco from Lebanon or Syria and Perique tobacco from Louisiana. But even his Virginia tobacco is garbage. I'm an expert in this. The colonial government's profit since 1918 has come from the plantation that I own. Just imagine this. The profit of the colonial government from tobacco in Sumatra in 1918 was around three million gulden. They got 10% of a 34.8% profit from me. I have a good relationship with the Dutch government. All right then. - Can we start the transaction today? - Sure. Should I pay cash here, or do you want payment through the bank? Bank. I choose the NV Bank. Bie, you don't have to go back to Semarang this early. Organize people in Kudus who are in charge of receiving the goods and then send them back to our warehouse in Glodok. Got it. One thing's for sure, we will need a lot more warehouses here. That's right. CHEN KUAN TAY TOBACCO FACTORY SRIGOENTING, KUDUS I'm going now. Watch the warehouse carefully. CHEN KUAN TAY TOBACCO FACTORY SRIGOENTING, KUDUS Sir, can I take a look inside? - No, you can't. - Really? Go home. Here, this is for you. - Now, may I go inside? - Go ahead. Go on in. Tan Pen Liang, you bastard! If you think this is a scam, think again. What have you lost? Those people in Kudus paid you well. They're never late. You still get the profit. That's not the point. It can't be this simple. There must be something deeper behind this. Okay, but what? - I don't know yet. - Then you should find out first. No. We've been too soft on him. He must go down. What do you mean we have to bring him down? We'll burn down his warehouse on the eve of Chinese New Year. What are you doing? Run! Go! Bastard! Have mercy on me. Don't torture me anymore. I only did what Boen Hiap told me to. Hey! So, you want to burn down all these warehouses here? Answer him! The six warehouses belonging to Boen Hiap won't get burnt down. I've poured a substance on his warehouses that will extinguish the fire. Amazing. You are amazing. Now, I'm telling you to burn this warehouse! Here! You jerk! Fire! Honestly, I find this suspicious, Inspector. The dead body in my warehouse was found holding a key... Yes. That's what I want to ask you. Why don't you check the padlocks of Thio Boen Hiap's warehouses? Just check them. All the padlocks of Thio Boen Hiap's warehouses are new. So what are you trying to say? I believe you're better than me at solving mysteries. That's why I would be glad if you would investigate where the fire came from and what key it was that was found on that body. As a token of appreciation, please accept... Don't. It is my job to investigate that case. You have to do your job with passion. That's the professionalism of a police officer. I am happy to hear that. To honor that professionalism, I hope you're willing to accept this. Please make me proud to be a Chinese man. This is our custom that's related to Chinese New Year. This is an obligation of our faith that the Chinese people have to do. If you don't accept it, you are hurting our feelings. Madam, this is merely an angpao. I don't know, sir. Nonsense! You don't know?! You know what? You can't say you don't know anymore! But, if you still insist on saying that you don't know, then I might order you to stay here for a few days until you can say that you know! Take him to the cell! It still sounds odd. Why did they burn that man in the warehouse? If they just wanted to kill someone and get rid of the evidence, why not just throw him into the Angke River? This case is related to a rivalry. The police suspect that the fire was intentionally started. That is correct. And what's more correct is that the person who set the fire was Tan Peng Liang. Tan Peng Liang. It was not Thio Boen Hiap. Sir! Is that a suspicion or an accusation? We have proof. Proof? Yes. We have someone who can testify for this case. - His name is Akong. - Akong? Who is he? - Is this envelope for us? - Yes. Please accept it with open arms. Once again, this is an entreaty from a corporal to his generals. - What is this? - We, the Chinese, call it angpao. Go ahead, go ahead. We've been outsmarted by him. Tan Peng Liang was ahead of us in getting the press on his side. No wonder the press seemed to be biased. "Due to a party that needed it, we decided to donate the money that you gave us." That's typical! The sanctimonious press! They think they're doing a lawful job for the sake of the public! We're doomed! Bie, find Akong. Right now. And bring him here. Go! Yes, sir. You have to be confident. Don't fall into their trap. The safest answer is, "I don't know," or denying everything. The prosecutor will usually only bluff about facts. As long as you keep denying everything, they will get confused. That way, they will stop asking questions. Keep that in mind. Sit here. Sit here. When the warehouses were on fire, where were you? It was the eve of Chinese New Year. That was not my question. My question was, where were you when the warehouses in Glodok were on fire? Pardon me, Mr. Prosecutor. I said that was Chinese New Year. - It means I was with my family that night. - Really? Is that true? According to the police statement, you don't have a family. You've been married for 25 years but you don't have any children. - You only live with your wife. - Objection, Your honor. Go ahead. The point that Mr. Prosecutor mentions is irrelevant. Wait. May I answer the question, Your Honor? Yes, please. Does Mr. Prosecutor think a man and a woman bound in marriage and living in the same house under the same roof are not a family? Silence! Fine. So you were with your family. Were you inside the house or outside the house? At first, I was inside the house, but then I also went outside. When you left the house, was it of your own volition? Or was there someone else asked you to go out? Of my own volition. If we have a witness saying that you left the house because someone knocked on your door, what would your answer be? - It's not true. - All right. What if a witness saw you leaving your house, and saw your accomplice named Akong? Damn, Mr. Thio Boen Hiap. You haven't answered my question. Was the person who asked you to leave the house to see the fireworks Akong? Yes. That's all from me, Your Honor. Good. BETAWI BAROE OFFICE Mr. Pangemanan? The director of Betawi Baroe? Yes. That's me. I'd like to make an offer. What offer? An offer to permit us to team up with Max Awuy. I will be responsible for anything that might happen. I need to know the answer. And I'm sure that the answer has to be from Tan Peng Liang's accessories. I bet there's something off about Tan Peng Liang. And now we have to reveal it. Is it possible there are two men named Tan Peng Liang? I'm not sure if there is another man with the name Tan Peng Liang. We have to investigate it. The news about the attack on Max Awuy, the Betawi Baroe reporter... It's still not certain that Tan Peng Liang has bribed the Betawi Baroe. Right. So, it's the right moment for us to start building a good relationship with them. What for? If you ask what for, we might as well not be helping Thio Boen Hiap in the first place. It's clear that he did the crime. Max. Damn! - What is it? - Watch out! I'm sure there's a door leading to the basement. Wan Sen, look. We'll take one of these and the fake money. - Then, we report to the police. - Yes. They might stop the trial of Thio Boen Hiap and charge Tan Peng Liang instead. Yes. That's better. Move! Honey! Honey. What is it? Zi Chi Siang? That woman? Honey! Now I remember. She was a Ca-bau-kan in Kalijodo. Now I understand. No way. There are two Tan Peng Liangs. When I used that woman's services, that Chi Siang, Tan Peng Liang's henchmen got mad and tried to kill me. Damn! TAN PENG LIANG ARRESTED FOR COUNTERFEITING MONEY So, your name is also Tan Peng Liang? Yes. I need your help so I won't have to deal with the impact of being wrongly accused. Why have you come here now? The Dutch policeman JP Vordoren told me to come here. He told me to ask the Kong Koan to help me so people won't get mistaken and think I'm him. So people won't blame me for a crime I didn't do. Life is only temporary. The time will come when you will need me. And the reason is? My Chinese zodiac sign is the rat. I can live literally anywhere. In the dark alley or in the filthiest ditch. - Thank you. - Yes. Tardjo. How did you end up here? Tardjo. To defeat the Dutch and get them out of here, we can no longer use riffles. Riffles always lose. Just think of the battle that happened here. From Pattimura, Hasanuddin, Diponegoro, right up to Cut Nyak Dien. Yes. So? We always lose in battles with riffles. That's why we have to fight them with the economic weapon, which is money. Excuse me. Can I see someone named Oey Eng Goan? There? Thank you. Do you remember a man called Tan Peng Liang? Tan Peng Liang, that man from Semarang, was an evil man. He is dead. But his name still exists. Numerous efforts have been made to get rid of him, but he still exists. What an evil man. Evil. What have people done to Tan Pen Liang? A lot. Thio Boen Hiap burnt his warehouse. But it was Tan Peng Liang who got arrested. He stood trial and got sent to jail because they caught him making fake money. That he managed to escape to Macau, even to Thailand, is all because of his brave Ca-bau-kan. Is your child sick? Don't worry. Just come with me. Will you do that? That's impossible. Why? I still like Peng Liang. Only like him? That's easy to overcome. Just like me instead. I also love him. That's also easy. Just transfer your love to me. That's impossible. I think it's possible. You can't measure love. Love may seem like it's merely love, but true love does not measure. Measurement can divide love in two. Two can create a feud. A feud can create fights. - Thank you, Doctor. - Doctor! Hello. You are very cute. Come on. - What's your name? - Giok Lan. Where does it hurt? Where does it hurt? How much should I pay, Doctor? I will pay for you. Thank you, Madam. What do you mean? Adoption. Meaning, we want to raise and take care of your children. Come on! It's all right. Accept it! It means we will take your children to the Netherlands. They will live there with us. What? To the Netherlands? - That's great. - Yeah. And we would be happy if you agreed. Yes. Of course. The letters from the Netherlands kept coming, but Tinung never read them because she was illiterate. The last letter contained sad news about the death of one of her children. - Hurry up! - Where are you taking me? Wait a minute! Come with me to Sewon! - Hurry up! - I don't want to! Let me go! Come on! Hurry up! Tinung. Do you still remember me? - Do you remember me or not? - Yes, I do. You were pregnant when you left this house. Now, where's the child? In the Netherlands. In the Netherlands? What is she doing? Shut up! - Okay. I'm sorry. - Leave! - Now! - Okay! In the Netherlands? Yes. Wait, wait, wait. In the Netherlands. Did I hear it correctly? Crazy! Have mercy. Please forgive me. If you want to kill me now, just kill me. Have mercy. Mercy. Have mercy. Have mercy. Mercy. Have mercy. Enough. Don't cry. Stop crying. Mercy. Have mercy. Stop crying. Have mercy. I am in Macau. You watch over Tinung. Hey! Don't joke with me! I saw it with my own eyes. Bastard! Hey! Don't you dare say the name Tan Peng Liang! Or I will kill you! Now, tell me the truth! Who took Zi Chi Siang? I swear, it was Tan Peng Liang. You jerk! Hey! Tan Peng Liang is no longer in the Dutch East Indies! Not that Tan Peng Liang. It's Tan Peng Liang, the banana merchant in Sewon. - What? Tan Peng Liang the banana merchant? - Yes. His hitmen come here often. Tan Peng Liang came here too. Damn! Do you know where he lives? - Jembatan Lima. - Which part of Jembatan Lima? The house with green paint, with a starfruit tree in front of it. But he wasn't home earlier today. - So where is he now? - Maybe in Sewon, Tangerang. He's there now. To be honest, I came here because I was told to look for Tinung. I don't understand. Chi Siang. Who's that? Did you forget? Chi Siang was a Ca-bau-kan in Kalijodo. People said your hit men kidnapped her to be your mistress. I swear, I don't know her. That's slander! Fine. I believe you. But if I ever see her in Sewon dead or alive, I will come to you and make you pay for it. Who is that Chi Siang? That's just a crazy woman. Wake up, you idiot. Damn! Who broke into my house? Come out! Don't hide, you coward! Come out and face me! Tinung! Tinung! Where are you, Tinung? Tinung! Tinung, where are you? Tinung! Where are you? Who are you? Were you the one who killed my men? I didn't kill your men. But I want to hear it from you directly. Why did you send your hitmen to kill me in Kalijodo? REST IN PEACE IN MACAU TAN PENG LIANG, A FUGITIVE WHO COUNTERFEITED MONEY AND ESCAPED FROM THE DETENTION CENTER, HAS DIED IN MACAU, CHINA, A PORTUGUESE COLONIAL COUNTRY. MEMORIAL HALL These are the assets. Work hard. Don't leave me, honey! If he's still alive, I promise I will crush him like a fly. Who knows? Maybe there's a hidden agenda behind this. Everybody now fantasizes about things like everything is a Hollywood movie. Why did he want to be buried here? Because the people in his family want to mock everybody. They will show off that he could have a luxurious grave and his coffin would be paraded by six-meter-high ondel-ondel. - Honey! - Trust me. That's the only reason. Honey! Don't leave me! What will happen to Giok Lan? - Sam! - Yes, sir! You're living a nice life. The Dutch like you. Is that right? What do you think about that? That's nonsense. The myth about white supremacy is no longer accurate. So, what's your opinion about Japan? My opinion about Japan? Well, what else other than thank you? Set! Order arms! Yes! About, face! Order arms! See you later. God be with us. See you later. God be with us. Tomorrow is a mystery. If people ask how long a lover will be faithful to his other half, then I will be the first to take the chance to be the traitor. We have the same goal. I don't trust the Japanese either. Praise be to God. - For Indonesia! - For Indonesia! Call me Jeng Tut. I'd be honored. I'm Simon Cheng. Please. I'm sorry. Cigarette? No. Thank you. To make a better first impression, I don't smoke. It appears our business has the potential for long-term collaboration. We share a common interest. I hope so. All right. Well. To be honest, our business relates to killing two birds with one stone. I'm not surprised to hear that. But what about the details? You will find out later. But before that, I'd like to know something. Do you have a problem with the word "communist"? I am a merchant. Communists and capitalists are the same to me. If I can get a profit from the sale, I'll do it. The Japanese haven't altered the fundamental status of Thailand as an independent country because there is no military need here. What they need is a permit from the government. The permit that the Thailand Kingdom gave to the Japanese has triggered people to make an underground movement to eliminate the Japanese. These people joined forces with The Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army which is now doing guerrilla warfare in the southern forests. Their role model is Indonesia. To be honest, we are on both sides. But I'm not on both sides. You don't have to be there. You are a merchant. You want to make a profit. How do I do that? To be honest, with weapons. So, are you interested in smuggling weapons to them? This is what I call killing two birds with one stone. I'll always remember that. When the Japanese came, all the Kong Koan members were sent to jail. Thio Boen Hiap gave the Japanese soldiers a gift to bribe them to set the Kong Koan members free. What gift? Tinung. The beautiful wife of Tan Peng Liang. Thio Boen Hiap told the Japanese soldiers that Tinung could dance and sing. But if they couldn't enjoy the dance or the song, at least they could enjoy her body. Tinung was taken and gang-raped by the Japanese soldiers. She was then forced by them to be a comfort woman in a long house in Sukabumi. Bastard! How dare those Japanese soldiers set foot in this house?! Come on! Hurry up! Betawi. I am home. Yes. The situation is getting worse. We just received news from Magelang. General Nakamura has been captured, and the Japanese are preparing to send their full strength through Kido Butai in Jatingale to attack Semarang. Because they think we're responsible for that. By attacking Semarang, the Japanese want to terrorize Jogja and Solo. Even though we're here, we're not really confident. If they really do attack us, our weapons are limited. I can help you. That's not a big matter. But there is one bigger problem for me. Wait a minute. What do you mean by "not a big matter"? About the weapons, of course. It's really not a problem. I am in charge of the weapons trading from Siam. - What? - Yes. You heard me correctly. That's not a problem for me. But there's something that's more concerning to me. It's about Tinung. I heard that you searched for her all the way to Sukabumi. Did you find her? And how is she? Promise me you won't be shocked. Listen. I've already got the facts. Tinung is... a comfort woman in Sukabumi. What? Yes. You may get angry. But try and control your anger and use it in a proper way. During the celebration of Tinno Heikka, Thio Boen Hiap told the Japanese soldiers to get Tinung. To sing and dance Cokek. Bastard! Tinung was taken by a member of the Kempeitai. - She has not come home since. - Don't. Don't. Eventually, she was locked up in Sukabumi. Don't. - I seek forgiveness in God. Tinung. - Don't. - Don't be scared. It's me. Tardjo. - Don't. - Do you remember me? - Don't. We will get out of here. Don't. I have committed so many sins, Sister. - Good morning, Sister. - Good morning, sir. I want to meet Tinung, my wife. Tinung. She likes to sit in the park. There she is. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Tinung. Honey. Hush now. I still love you, Tinung. I still love you. I've got important news! Have you heard? Tan Peng Liang is not dead! Now he's having fun in... Enough! Shut up! We are thinking of what to do next! - But... - Shut up! Stop that joke! Hold on. "What do you think will happen if..." See? Note that you are saying "if"! If Indonesia gets its freedom, will the status quo be preserved? I mean, why don't we be flexible? Remember our proverb. In Bung Karno's speech, it was clearly described. The ideal of a nation with a motto of "Bhineka Tunggal Ika," which means "Unity in Diversity"! I am willing to bet that Indonesia won't get its independence. The Japanese might lose. But even if they lose, it doesn't mean that the Dutch won't come back here. Yes, that's right. Indonesia is the Dutch East Indies, no matter what. And Jakarta is Batavia. The medicine man will always be surrounded by idiots. We can see a medicine man in Ikada. Not everybody in the field would be interested in only one medicine man. And Bung Karno, he only seems charming in Jakarta. Insane! This is really crazy! He's really... Calm down. What is it? I saw it with my own eyes. Tan Peng Liang is alive! He's alive. He just left his place in Gang Holland. What did I tell you? I saw it with my own eyes! At first, I never thought that Indonesia would get its independence. That Tan Peng Liang, he even helped his Indonesian cousin. He went back and forth to Thailand, smuggling weapons to Indonesia to help in the battle. What an evil man. He was an evil man. Don't worry about the ammo supply. Soon, we will see the smuggling expert who's just come back from Thailand. All right. What's your plan after this is all done? Get married. You? Me too. I'm ready to help. What's important is that when Indonesia gets its independence one day, and you get good positions in the government, please don't forget about me. I just want to live in peace, with my family. Right, Tardjo? What's wrong? What's the matter? I am useless now. Why do you say that? It's been three years since we got back together, but I can't give you a child like Tardjo's wife can. I'm barren now. This is my karma. I'm trash. Don't say that. But I can't give you a new Giok Lan. It's all right. If we can't have one now, we still have tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. We still have a chance. Come here. Come here. There. Look at that star shining alone over there. People in Tiongkok have been studying astrology for 3300 years. Way before the Dutch learned to write. Can people go to the stars? That's possible. Which is further? The stars or Betawi? The stars, of course. Do they have war in the stars? If the Dutch exist in the stars, then there will be war there. But the Japanese are even more cruel. Ghost! Why are you screaming as if there's been a death in this house? Thio Boen Hiap! There will be a death in this house! Sit down! Relax. You and I will play a game of trial. I don't understand. This place is the courtroom. And you are the witness for yourself as well as the defendant. I play the roles of prosecutor, judge, and lawyer. As a prosecutor, I indict you for harming Tinung, the wife of Tan Peng Liang. You gave her to the Japanese soldiers. What did you mean by doing that? I don't know anything about that. Really. Fine. You will know more if we do this. - Mercy, Tan Peng Liang. Mercy! - Mercy? Wait a minute. The one who put a gun against your head was the prosecutor. Now, I want to ask the lawyer. Defender, what do you think about the defendant's plea for mercy? - It's up to you, Your Honor. - Fine. It's up to the judge. Today I am the judge. And I decide, no mercy for Thio Boen Hiap! The sentence is death! Mercy! I beg your mercy, Tan Peng Liang! That was nothing! What was ruined was the ceiling of your house. Now, you'd better prepare to scream in regret. Come on! Mercy. I respectfully beg for mercy. Mercy? Who do you beg mercy from? Your mercy, sir. - From who? - From you, sir. You have to learn to say "sir" in a decent way, without making it sound like an insult. Many times that word refers to people considered old, stupid, and dirty! - I swear. Really, I respect you... - Respect? This is the first time this room has ever witnessed a drama like this! Believe me, sir. Believe me. Believe you? Believe a snake like you? I'll do no such thing! It is written that a snake has to be smashed by the head. Now, count to three. Please don't kill me, Koh Peng Liang. - You're such an actor! - Please. Shut up! He thought I didn't know who killed Thio Boen Hiap. But strangely, he became even more famous. Everybody adored him. Bye, Everyone! Wow. Who would've thought? I am visited by an influential madam from Siam. I am not an influential madam yet. I will be when we start our partnership again. Really? Come on in. Get the durian. Over there. - Come in. - Thank you. - Is this your child? - Yes. - What's your name? - Ginanjar. Take him inside. Come in. Please. Please sit down. I'll get to the point. I have a business proposal that might interest you, sir. Come now. We agreed not to speak formally. After your country gained its independence, I thought the speech would change too. Don't worry. I'm still the same person. So, what's the business proposal you were talking about? Listen. If you're interested in the agricultural business, the Thai government is focusing on that field. I happen to own a 250-hectare piece of land in Nonthaburi province. That land is perfect for Kradum and Kan Yao durian plantations. In ten years, we can sell the harvest to Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. You don't have to doubt the quality. If you're interested, here are the samples. - And the profit sharing? - Fifty-fifty. As you know, I am not a communist. So, I'm not interested in the phrase, "All equal in status, all feeling equal." What about this? We'll split it 70-30. This is just a rough estimation, meaning that I dare to speculate without knowing the ins and outs and I haven't done the math yet. All right. I'll have to do my calculations too then. Great. But don't take too long. If you agree, we can go to Bangkok together next week. I'll see you tomorrow then. - All right. - Please. Have you talked to other people in Jakarta about this? No, I haven't. I don't know any other businessmen apart from you. Good. Come on. Honey. Honey! Honey! Honey! Mbok! Mbok, help! Honey! Help! Honey! Honey! Honey! What actually happened? Yes. It was me behind it. I sent people to kill him. Tan Peng Liang was murdered? Yes. I poisoned him. I put poison inside the durian that was brought by Jeng Tut. Oh my God. Jeng Tut. That evil woman, she's dead too. Everyone is dead. I'm the only one who's still alive. Apparently, it's not nice to live like this until you get old. For my devotion to Dad, I have to kill Oey Eng Goan. You are weird, Ginanjar. You interpret love merely as devotion. You forget. There is also forgiveness and compassion in love. How can you feel love if you don't have forgiveness and compassion which can give you peace? What are you trying to say, Cik Lan? Think simple. You won't be able to feel at peace if your heart is consumed by a grudge. What do you think you will gain from that? Do you think that will make you Mother Teresa? BORN: SEMARANG, 17 APRIL 1900 DIED: JAKARTA, 6 JANUARY 1960 BORN: BATAVIA, JUNE 1918 DIED: JAKARTA, 12 MARCH 1960 I am the daughter of a Ca-bau-kan. I am not upset if you, just like all Malays, absurdly say "Cabo" instead of "Ca-bau-kan." What makes me upset if you think a Ca-bau-kan is some kind of immoral woman. I have defended it... not only fixed it.
