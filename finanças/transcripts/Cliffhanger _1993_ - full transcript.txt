[chopper blades whirring] [radio static] [man over radio] Rescue three. Jessie, do you see him yet? - Patience, my love, patience. - [radio static] Wait a minute. I think I have him sighted. Frank, what's the word? The word is we got him over there. [man over radio] Rescue three, this is Rescue Center. Over. [Jessie] This is three. Go ahead. [man over radio] Jessie, we 're getting general clearance in the southeastern region of the park. You will probably have sufficient cloud base to get into the tower, but please be advised you'll still encounter some strong winds and turbulence. We would advise against a winch rescue. Over. [Jessie] Wilco, Center. I'll proceed with wire cross from opposite tower. - Three out. - Center out. [chopper blades whirring] [Jessie] Gabe, Hal's signaling he's OK. [static] Gabe? Gabe, where are you? I'm just hanging out, Jess. [laughs] Oh, my God. I don't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. [Gabe] Hey, be careful, or you 7! embarrass old Frank. It would take a heap more than that, rock-jock. [Gabe] Yeah. Gabe? They're below the top of the tower. They're on the ledge just above you. You got another few feet. [static] - Glad you could join us. - Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah. Hi, Gabe. So, how's the knee? I think it's out. No big deal. Oh, yeah, I remember when you twisted it getting out of that hot tub. I thought it was an old war wound from 'Nam. Really? Hmm. Rescue three. I've located a stranded climber. Jessie, please send down a transport line. [zip line whirring] [Gabe] So, tell me, how you feeling? Fine, considering. What do you say we take off... and leave this clown behind, huh? [Sarah] Don't tempt me. Rescue three. Please be advised that Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend... that's liable to get his ass kicked right off this mountain. Over. Be informed Gabe makes advances to me only or he'll be climbing down 4,000 teet and sleeping outside. - [static] - Baby, he lies. [all laugh] - Is it really 4,000? - Yeah, just about. Hey, remember, whatever this guy says about me, don't believe it, OK? Thanks. [slack line whirring] OK. Come on over. [sockets buckling] [Hal] I know you're nervous, but we've done this a hundred times, OK? - Mm-hmm. - [Hal] Mmm? OK? Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub? [Hal laughing nefariously] Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. OK? [screams] [laughing and whooping] [Gabe] All right, that's great, Hal. [Hal laughing] Hey! That really inspires confidence. [gaping and grunting] So, how did this clown talk you into climbing up to the tower? He told me it was better than sex. Really? [Gabe] You ready for the best ride in the park? - Give me a second. I'll let you know. - [Gabe] OK. [Hal gasping and grunting] Ah, you look like hell. [Sarah] He made it. Of course he did. Of course he did. Really, there's nothing to it. OK, I can do this. - Sure you can. - [Sarah sighs] I'm sorry for all the trouble, really. - Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it. Really. - Thanks. [kisses] - Did you see that? - [Hal] Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] - We're still on for dinner tonight, right? - [Gabe] Of course we are. OK. - [Gabe] OK. You're ready now. - OK. [Gabe] That's it. [clamps whirring] [Gabe] Now, just sit right down into it. Come on, guys. The Wind's picking up. All right, Sarah, just keep your eyes on me. No, don't look... Sarah. Sarah, [chuckles] look... Sarah, look at me. That's it. - Right. - [Gabe] Just start to pull. One hand after another. That's it. Sarah, You're doing great... really, great. Keep goin'. And just keep looking at me. [straining] Sarah, that's great! You're starting to look like a pro. Keep going. That's it. Nice and easy. Hey, Hal, we're gonna be out at a job soon. - [Sarah groans] - [Gabe] All right, a little more, Sarah. That's it. That's it. One, two. [screams] [Gabe] Sarah? - [Sarah] Oh, God! - [Gabe] Sarah! [Sarah] Gabe! Gabe! No! No! - [Sarah] Gabe! - [Gabe] Sarah, Hold on! - Sarah! - [Sarah] Gabe! - Oh, please, I'm going to fall! - [Hal] No, you're not! You're OK. You're going to be OK! - Can you reach the main line? - No, I can't! - [Gabe] Don't swing. - [Sarah] God, I'm slipping! - Gabe, can you keep the line steady? - That clip's not gonna hold! - I can't hold on, Gabe! Help me, please! - [Jessie] Gabe. - You have to go after her. - No! - Gabe, no! - Hold on, Sarah. - I'm coming out to get you! - [Hal] No! It's not rigged for two people. Just keep it from swinging. I'm gonna send out my harness. Forget the harness. There's no time! I'm going for her! Gabe, shit! No! - [Sarah screams] - [Gabe] Sarah, I'm coming for you! [Sarah] I can't hold on! I'm slipping! [Gabe] Hold on just a little bit longer! I'm coming for you! [Sarah] Gabe, please hurry! I can't hold on! Sarah, don't look down. Keep looking at me. - That's it. Hold it. - I'm trying! It's breaking. She's losing it. - Sarah! He'll have you in a second, baby! - [Sarah] No, I can't - Come on, baby! Don't you give up! - No! No! [Hal] Look at me, baby. Come on. - Please, Sarah! - Hurry, Gabe. You're almost there. - You're almost there, Gabe. Keep going. - [Gabe] I'm here, Sarah. - Sarah, I'm here. - [Sarah] Gabe! - I don't want to die! - [Hal] Sarah! Reach up and grab him! Reach up! - [Gabe] Sarah, reach up! - [Hal] Come on, honey! - Use your other hand! Reach up now. - [Gabe] Reach up! - [Gabe] Sarah, you've got to reach out! - [Sarah screams] [Gabe] Hold on! Hold on! I got you! I got you. - I can't hold on! I'm going to die! - You are going to be all right. - No! - You're not going to die. Don't you lose her, Gabe. I got her. Reach up. [grunt] I'm slipping. I'm slipping! [Sarah screams] - You can do it, Sarah. - Hold her, Gabe! Hold her. [Sarah] Gabe, please don't let me fall. Please, please, I don't want to die. - [Gabe] You're not gonna die. - [Sarah] I'm slipping! [Gabe] Sarah, I got you! Just reach up! [Sarah] I can't, Gabe! You can do it. Please, baby, just reach up! - Reach up! - Hal! Hal! I'm slipping! Gabe, man, don't you lose her! - Don't you let her go! - Don't let me fall. [Gabe groans] [Sarah] I'm slipping! [screams] Sarah, please. No! No, I'm slipping! Gabe! Gabe, don't let me fall! No! - No! - Help me! I'm falling! Gabe! [Sarah] No! Please! [Sarah screams] Gabe! No! Sarah, no! No! Jesus Christ. [man on radio] ...forty-four A. [woman on radio] Treasury Agent, Mac Lamoore, please contact D.A. U. [man] Lock 'em up. Travers, we'll be fueled up and ready to go in ten minutes. Very good. [woman] Mr. Travers. Thank you. - [Walt] Hey, Rich. - Morning, Walt. This is Agent Matheson, F.B.I. Mr. Travers. Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride. Got plenty of room. Be glad to accommodate you. - Appreciate it. - You're the boss. Let's head out to the tarmac. Matheson, have you been totally briefed? - [Matheson] I don't know about totally. - Who the hell ever is? It's the most protected shipment we've got and the most useless. These bills aren't even in circulation. $1,000 bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange. You always transport through the air? Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked, trains derailed... but nobody can touch us in flight. Haven't lost a bill in 12 years, Walt. Don't jinx me now. [chuckles] I swear. Treasury agents are the most superstitious people in the entire federal government. We should be. Everybody wants what we have. [vehicle approaching] [music playing] [Brett] Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe! - It's Gabe. He's back! - [Evan] I can see that, man. Hey, Gabe! Come on, man. Let's go! [honking] - Hey, Gabe! - Gabe! [brakes screeching] [Evan] Gabe! [loud music playing] How you doing, Gabe? [Brett] Dude, turn that down. You guys. How you doing, Brett, Evan? Hey, man, where you been? You fall off the planet or something? No, I've been working up in Denver. - [Brett] Work? - Yeah! Don't say that word, man. Man, I hate work, even when somebody else is doing it. [Brett] Hey, Gabe, we're flying off the tower today. You should come on with us. Yeah, man. Today's going to be the day for a killer jump. - No, thanks. Can't. - Come on, man. Don't tell me that job in Denver made you scared of heights? No... Hey, look, you guys better watch out 'cause some bad weather's comin' in, OK? We like it extreme. Hey, man, see you later, Gabe. Good to have you back. Yeah, good to see you. Later. Peace. [brake squeals] [thunder rumbling in the distance] [Gabe] How you doing, Jess? Hello, Gabriel. [horse whimpers] Got yourself a new horse? - [Jessie] Where have you been? - Just working. After the funeral, I just had to leave. [Jessie scoffs] Had to leave? Believe me, a lot of us wanted to leave. But you know what? We stayed. Jess... a lot at things fell apart on that ledge. I know. But I don't think you know how much. Why can't you just believe you did everything you could? Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked. I don't know. [Jessie] I was there, remember? You were the only one who didn't panic. So, why don't you do us a favor and quit hording all the guilt? You held on as long as you could. And what about Hal? What was Hal doing on the tower with a girl who could barely climb? Look, I can't blame Hal for anything, Jessie, it was me. All me. Well, give it up, Gabe... because let me tell you something... it doesn't get any better. It doesn't get any better? Mmm. I really don't think you understand. - What? - I don't think you understand. I don't understand? I think I'm the only one that understands. Believe me, there were times when I didn't know what I wanted to do more... hate you or love you. But one thing I did know and I still do know... is I understand you. Did you come back to stay? You didn't. I can't. I can't. Not here. Jessie, I came back for you. And if you like, I want you to come with me. You come back after being gone for almost a year and you expect me to just leave? This is our home. Now it's my home. And I can't just pick up and go for all the wrong reasons. Jessie... If you don't mind, I'd better pick up the rest of my stuff. You know where everything is. I'm late for work. [engine starts] [dog whimpers] Hey, big boy. [thunder rumbling in the distance] [man over radio] Roger, Five-Lima, scattered, broken clouds... 20,000 feet with a severe storm advisory. Check the storm scope. Travers says you're being transterred. Oh, yeah. Moving up in the world. Mmm. [man on TV] The forecast... cloudy skies with flurries today. We can expect an inch of snow and a high in the low 303. Overnight flurries will increase with a total accumulation of three inches. - [Jessie sighs] - Tonight's low near 15. [Hal] Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece. [Frank] Hiya, Jess. Oh, I think old Frank nailed it with that stroke. What do you think? [Hal] I don't know. What do you see? Surprise me. What usually eats a banana? [Hal] A monkey. This is a picture of a banana eating a monkey. - Nature in reverse. - [chuckles] Where? - Right here. - [Hal guffaws] Frank, you look like a normal guy, but he's not... are you, Frankie? [Frank] Hey, I'm an artist. We're being tracked. - We have a Jetstar, three o'clock. - Travers! Stay put. Don't anyone jump to conclusions. - He's coming in too slow. - No, we're going too fast. We're too high. Give me 180 knots, drop to 15,000 feet. You got it. Christ. We're losing altitude and slowing down. Get your weapons. What the hell are you doing? I have jurisdiction on this jet. Now I have jurisdiction. I said get your weapons! These are highly trained agents, Mr. Matheson. I think you're overreacting. Just calm down and give me the gun. You're out of control. What the hell are you waiting for, goddamn it? Don't you see what he's doing? He's hijacking the shipment. [panting] What the fuck was that? [pilot screams] - Move into position. - [man] Look alive, Kristel. Crossover transfer, ten seconds and counting. November one-two-niner-five Lima... this is Jetstar six-eight-zero Tango-Tango. Is frequency secure? Over. [man over radio] Roger, Tango-Tango. This is Five-Lima. Go ahead. [Kristel] We have visual contact. What is your heading, speed and level? Over. [man over radio] We're heading 0-8-0 and doing 2-5-0 knots level... at flight level 2-1-0-niner. Over. [man 2] Five-Lima, we 're opening up. Rise and shine, gentlemen. Let's make history. [Kristel] Roger, Five-Lima. We'll begin closing. Bring your speed back to 1-5-0. Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0 and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over. [man] We're level. Flight level 1-4-0 and steady, 2-6-0 degrees. The weather ahead looks a bit threatening. [Kristel] Roger. - [man] Travers, report your position. - [Travers] Ready to disengage tail cone. Stand by. - [Kristel] Tail cone's clear. - [man] Roger. [man] Phase one complete. [man 2] Tango-Tango, prepare to receive cable. [Kristel] Tango-Tango standing by. [man] Tango-Tango, what's the turbulence back there? [Kristel] She's all over the place. This thing's got the response of a 747 at this speed. [man] Sounds like fun. We're streaming the drogue down. We'll see you in a minute. [Kristel] Welcoming party's ready. Good luck. We're moving in to pick up the drogue now. Tango-Tango out. [man] I've got it. Stand by, Kristel. [Kristel] Standing by. We're locked on. Into the transfer position. [Kristel] Check. Moving into transfer position. [pilot] We're closing to 1-4-0 feet. [Kristel] We 're closing. We 7! report when in position. - Travers, We're too close to the storm. - Don't lose your nerve. All they'll find is a plane that went down in the storm. - Hurry up, Travers. - On my way. The cases are hooked up and ready. Charge goes off in five minutes. Stick to the plan and you're rich. [man] Got it. [Kristel] Tango-Tango in position. - What's taking so long? - [man] Patience. Tango-Tango, dip the plane. I'm coming over. [Kristel] Wilco, Five-Lima. Tango-Tango standing by at flight level 1-4-0 and steady 2-6-0 degrees. Five-Lima, I'm out of here. [man] Roger. [man 2] What the hell is he doing? [man] Five-Lima, where are the cases? [panting heavily] - Kristel, we've got him. - [Kristel] Roger. Why didn't you send the money first? Somehow, I didn't think you'd wait for me if I sent it first. [beeping] [Kristel] We're approaching the storm fast. I can't hold this course much longer. - [man] Niner-zero seconds. - What's keeping him? Let's move your ass up there. [man] I'm at the cases. Stand by. [Kristel] Tango-Tango standing by. You fuck. [Kristel] We've lost the pilot. - [man] Who did you leave up there? - [Travers] No one. Get underneath the jet. The cases will slide over. [Kristel] Who the fuck is the surprise guest? Just get those cases. He's hurt bad. What should we do with him? Get him to a hospital, fast. - We're not leveling out. - One-zero seconds. - I've lost hydraulics! - [man] We're going to be fine. [short beeps] [long beep] [screams] The cable's blown free. Don't unhook it. The cases are still there. - Don't lose the money, goddamn it! - Hold it. - Pull the cable! - We gotta pull! - Bypass switch one. - [Kristel] Check. - [man] Bypass switch two. - [man 2] Keep pulling. - [man] Nothing. - OK. Switch to manual. [man] Hold the fuckin' plane steady! - [man 1] Pull! Come on! - [man 2] Travers, don't fuck it up! - [Kristel] How's number one engine? - [Mike] Oil pressure falling. - [man] Come on. Don't lose the money. - [man 2] They're coming. [man] Oh! Goddamn it! Shit! - [man] We've lost it. - [Travers] Oh, fuck! [Qualen] Release the cable. Close it up. [beeping] [Qualen] So this is your idea of a foolproof plan? You stupid bastard. Kristel, what's the report? The hydraulics aren't functioning. He shot off the hydraulics. [Mike] We gotta fire warning light number four. I'm losing altitude. We're gonna go down! [Qualen] Dump the fuel. You'll have to pick your way through the peaks. [Kristel] Close the fuel valve and shut off all fuel pumps! [Qualen] Don't bother to buckle up. You may not want to survive this. [Kristel] Flaps to 25 degrees before we lose all power. [Mike] Flaps, 25 degrees. Reduce power 60%. Shut down all generators and the motors. Lower flaps. You may have to hand-crank them down. [Mike] You want the gear down? [Kristel] Leave the gear up. Shut down all power. [man] Check. [Kristel] Give me a hand with the controls. [deep rumbling] Wow! Did you catch that thunder? That was too loud for thunder, man. Come on. Let's rock and roll. [both] One, two, three! [both screaming and whooping] - [man 1] I'm free! - [man 2] Radical, man. - Man, look at me. Watch this. Yeah. - [man whooping] [Kristel] Mike? Mike? Shit. [gasping] You thought of everything, didn't you? Everything except what's happening now. Kill the pig! Your fucking plan almost killed us! Kill the pig, my ass. We're partners in this. Were. Give me the tracking monitor. What the hell are you gonna do with it? Don't make him ask twice. Give it to him. You want it? Take it. It's only got 50,000 code variations. - [gun cocking] - I'll break your fucking neck in a minute! - Go ahead. Break my fucking neck! - Sit down. In case you slept through the landing... you'll need all the money you can find to buy your way out of this country. You know it, and I know it. How do we get off the mountain, even if we find it? Kristel. I think we found a frequency. Somebody help, please. Is there somebody there? Somebody please help. Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in. Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in. [Kristel] Oh, thank God! Ah, we're stranded. We were hiking and lost our bearings. We didn't expect the weather to come in this fast. OK. Just take it easy. Take it easy. How many people in your party? Over. [static] Five people. I don't know where we are. I... I see only a cylinder-type rock formation. Over. It's got to be Comb Bluft. [Hal] Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there. Try to stay calm. We're on our way. You're gonna be all right. Please hurry. Billy's going into shock. Please, we need insulin. - Please, hurry. - [static] "We need insulin." Would you have thought of that? - Thank God you didn't leave. - Why? We just got an emergency call. Five climbers are stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in, and Hal's gone up alone. - Hal's a good climber. - What? What's that supposed to mean? It means he can handle it himself. It he gets up there and socked in by the weather, they'll never make it down. Gabe, he needs someone who has emergency medical training... and knows every handle to those peaks. I'm the last one he wants help from, and that's not what I came back here for. Our problems are not the issue right now. Those people are. What it he can't do it alone? Look, Jessie, I haven't climbed in months. You just lose the feel. Maybe you mean the nerve. I didn't mean that. It's OK. Gabe, I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore... but I'm talking about somebody that was your best friend. Please, Gabe, he took the west ridge. It you take the north face, you can beat him. No problem. [rain pattering] What has happened to you? Don't you feel anything anymore? Feel anything? Jessie, I came back for you. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you. Go ahead... leave. But if you don't do this now, you're gonna be stuck on that ledge for the rest of your life. [door opens] [engine starts] [Wright] Where the hell is that goddamn plane? Looks like she went down in the storm. Now, that storm front is still building, so even it we could send up a search plane it would be impossible to see anything on the ground. - What about roads? - There aren't any roads up there. [secretary] Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright. These two FBI agents were insisting on seeing you. Mr. Wright, I'm Agent Hayes. This is Agent Michaels. Look, If you're concerned about your agent who was along for the ride, I've got nothing to tell you. Matheson wasn't along for the ride. He was working surveillance. Surveillance? Of what? The Bureau have been getting sketchy reports that Treasury jets were being monitored between Denver and San Francisco. Now, we didn't wanna tell your department because we thought it might be an inside job. That's impossible. You're suggesting a hijacking? Hell no. Not only did I have my best men on that flight... but each one of those cases were monitored. And the money is in unexchangeable denominations. I tell you, man, it would be useless for anybody to try to steal it. Yeah, except for this man. - Who the hell is this? - Name is Eric Qualen. We've been tracking him for sometime now without much success. He's a former member of military intelligence... who's found it more profitable going to the other side. Industrial espionage. Hijacking diamonds from South Africa. Theft and disposal of millions in negotiable bearer bonds. You name it. He has the international connections to move this currency, Mr. Wright, and $100 million offers one hell of a temptation to this psychotic. [man] Jesus Christ. [Hal groans and pants] What the hell are you doing up here, man? I was talking to Jessie. She filled me in. [Hal] Did she? Well, now let me fill you in. As far as I am concerned, you can take your ass down and go back to that hole you've been hiding in. Once we get these people down, I'm gone, Hal. [Hal] No. You're out of here now. Why the hell did you come up here? To prove something? Look, I know how you feel about me, all right. [Hal] You don't know anything! You did it your way... and she died. - I did what I thought was right. - Well, you were wrong. It was your weight on the line that did it. There wasn't time for anything else, Hal. Oh... well, I guess we'll never know, will we? Look, Hal, it was a bad time for everybody. What the hell do you know about bad times, man? You didn't love her, and you didn't have to explain to her family. And you didn't have to look into her eyes when she was falling! - Now drop it! - No, buddy! It was you who dropped it. You want to do it? Do it. No... You live with it. [howling winds] [groans] They're here. [Qualen] Right on time. How many of them are there? [man] We got two heroes. We'll greet 'em at the top. - Where's the helicopter? - What the hell's going on? - Where's the helicopter? - It can't fly in this weather. - Is either of you a chopper pilot? - No. What are your names? Tucker and Walker. Well, Tucker and Walker, we're missing three bags. What's in them? None of your fucking business! Suits, socks, $100 million, the usual stuff. Travers here was smart enough to bring along a tracking device. Don't use my name, goddamn it. Key it. [device beeping] Look at the map. This is where we've lost our belongings. The red dots on the monitor are the three cases. You recognize these locations? Let me jar your memory. It you don't recognize them, you're useless. Useless items are usually discarded. - Right, Travers? - Get off my back, Qualen. Off? I haven't even got on it, yet. Once again, do you recognize these locations? Ryan. Yeah. We do. Then let's go. Wait a minute, asshole! [device beeping rapidly] Where is it? Up there. [Jessie] Rescue one, this is Rescue Center. Hal? Come in, Hal. - Over. - Nice. You're Hal? You, stay. You! Fetch. Fetch! Do it. [Jessie] Rescue one, this is Rescue Center. Do you copy? Hal, come in. Hal, come in. Over. [sighs] Watch yourself under the overhang. It could deliver anytime. Anytime you feel like saying something, don't. We're waiting, gentlemen. - I need my bolt gun and ice ax. - No. - Don't give him anything. - Take his coat for insurance. He could freeze to death! You've got your own problems, Hal. Ryan, get a rope. I want this dog on a leash too. Tie it. It better hold. Forget me. If you can, get away. Would you? Go fetch, wonder dog. Move it, Walker. [effort grunt] Keep it taut. Ryan, keep it taut! Hal, come in please. Hal, come in please. Over. [Gabe grunting] I don't trust him. Damn. [panting] I don't think we need two guides. Retire him when he comes down. [Hal] They're going to kill you! Don't come down! Don't come down! Pull the rope. Pull the rope! [screaming] - [Qualen] Pull, goddamn it! Pull! - [man groans] - [man] Come on! Pull! - Pull it! Pull, goddamn it! Ow! [man] Watch it! - Get him! - No! [Qualen] Do it. [screaming] Your friend just had the most expensive funeral in history. Now it's only you. [Jessie] Come in, Rescue Unit. Rescue Unit, come in. Hal, what's going on? Hal? Hal? Talk. No messages, no codes, no tricks. You haven't found us. It was a fake call. Jessie, I've just reached the top of the tower. So far, there's no sign of anyone. Looks like a phony call. Over. You've got to be kidding me. Do you want me to fly up after you? Over. No. Negative. The winds are still too high. I'm going to ride out the storm up here. We'll take shelter at the old Doug... Hal, I'm losing you. Hal. Come in. Come in, Hal. Over. Go on to the next case. He said the tower, but he's on Comb Bluff. Frank, fly me to the west valley. The winds are never too strong there. It's only a half-hour climb to the Douglas Shaft. It's the only shelter for miles around. Hal would have to go there. - Jessie, that is a bad idea. - Please, Frank. Look, if I don't find him, you can come pick me up by nightfall. Hal would have my head. And it's such a handsome head. Please, Frank. I'll buy one of your paintings. [chuckles] [Hal] Hold up! Where is it? There. On top of the peak. - Come on. - [Travers] Hold it. Looks like a winding route to me. The fastest way is straight up the east face. Of course, there are only 12 guys in the world who could do it. You want to try it? [wind howling] [groans] Gabe. What's happened? What's happened? Oh, my God. You're frozen. Come sit down. Gabe, where's your pack, where's your sweater? - Talk to me, Gabe. What happened? - They got Hal. The distress call was a fake. Fake? What do you mean it was fake? Before they crashed, they dumped cases of money. - They? Who's they? - I don't know. They're using Hal to find it. When they do, he's dead. Jess, you gotta get on the radio and call Frank... and tell him to call the state police. The cold killed my radio, but Frank's gonna be looking for me. - We’ll contact everybody from the chopper. - The sun goes down in an hour. What do you want me to do? Let's take everything we need. Let's move. We got to get to that next case before they do. [beeping] [Travers] We're close! - It's just up there! - It better be. You know something? I'm getting real fucking tired of your threats. Are you? [beeping] [panting] It's there. Oh, my God. What do we do now? You got a pencil? [panting] [Jessie groans] [Travers] Over here. [beeping] [Hal grunts] Goddamn. The son of a bitch is still alive! [grunts] I'm beginning to dislike this Mr. Walker. He can't be far. Find him. Go. Go. [breathing heavily] [Gabe] Come on. [panting] [grunts] Give me a flare. - Meet me at Eagle's Cape. - I'm not leaving. Jessie, don't worry about me! [screams] [grunts] [men scream] [screams] Gravity's a bitch, isn't it? Fuck the money, and fuck you! I wasn't born to die on a fucking mountain. [Kynette] Where were you born to die? Got a place picked out? I don't need to hear that fucking shit from you, boy. Come on... Maybe this boy should make this big mouth a little bigger. [Qualen] Stop this! The fight's not here. It's out there. Find us some shelter. Next time you're, like, watching MTV, you know... take a split second and flip it to the Weather Channel. I mean, hey, where would you rather be right now? Here in tent city, or at home playing some righteous air hockey? Air hockey's definitely got my vote. Exactly, cheesehead, exactly. - Cheesehead? - Cheesehead. [rattling] - He was here. - What was in there? Answer the man. - Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs. - Or equipment. Maybe Walker plans to look after his friend here. He's not my friend... and I don't like him any more than I do you. Nice try. But I never underestimate the power of loyalty when it comes naturally. Not like the kind that has to be paid for. Make a fire. It costs a fortune to heat this place. That's bad humor, I know. We better get some sleep. We're gonna need it. Rescue units, come in. Again, do you read? Come in. What the hell is going on up there? Hal. Jessie, do you read? Jessie. It looks as if we're drawing a crowd. We're down to a few hours before the whole fucking world shows up. - Where's the next one? - [Hal] It's on the tower. How far? - He asked how far, goddamn it! - [Hal screams] You know what I think? I think you've been taking the scenic route. Now, how far is it? Half a day. It's half a day. [Brett] Hey, Hal! Hal! Check it out, man. It's Hal. Hey, man, you stuck up here too? - You missed a great jump yesterday. - Walk over. For Christ's sakes, man, they're just kids. - Why don't you let them go? - We're not animals. Don't force us to be. Walk over. [Evan] Hey, man, was that storm a real bummer or what? Me and him were in tent city last night. - Yeah. - [Evan] Hey, Hal. We're gonna take one last jump and split. You baby-sitting hikers or what? - Run, man, run! Go! - What? Run! Get the hell out... [mouthing] No! Son of a bitch. You didn't have to kill... [Qualen] Shut up! Sue me. Fuck. [Travers] Shoot him! Dammit. Shoot him! You're letting him get away! Shoot him! [screams] Shit. Ow! You murdering motherfuck. Kill a few people, they call you a murderer. Kill a million, and you're a conqueror. Go figure. Move on, Tucker. Time is short. [Jessie] OK. Just like you said. - He's taking them the long way around. - All right. To stay ahead of them, we're gonna have to go through that crack. [Qualen] You said there was a way across. There is. - [Travers] Where the fuck is it? - There. You blind? Hell with the money. Radio the chopper. You just don't get it, do you? We're in bed now, joined at the hip, partners in crime. You've crossed over, Travers, and there's no crossing back. All right, that'll keep it dry. OK, let's do it. [grunts] Get a good footing. [Jessie] OK. It's slick, Jess. Good foothold. [grunts] Jessie, don't move. Oh, my God. - Let's get out of here. - No! [Gabe] Jessie, you gotta get down! Come on! [bats screeching] Get down! Stay close to me. [Jessie screams] All right, get down. Head down. Hold on. Just hold on now. [Jessie] It's on my backpack! It's on my back! [Gabe] Jessie, stop screaming. [screams] Stop, they're all over me. - [Gabe] Let's get out! - There's one on my back! It's off your back. It's off your back. - [Jessie] No, there is. - There's nothing on your back. - [Jessie panting] - It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. [Frank] Rocky Mountain Rescue Center, this is Rescue 3. Over. [man] Rescue three, this is Rescue Center. Go ahead. [Frank] The vis is good. I've got at least 20 miles in all directions. If anyone's out here, I'll find them. Over. [man] Roger, three. Center out. [beeping] [Frank] Center, this is three. I've picked up a signal on the thermal imager just north of Comb Bluff. Landing to investigate. [growling] [barking] [groaning] [wolves growl] Hey! Get out! Get out of here! [Frank screams] Get the hell out! Jesus Christ. Here, I got you. I got you. - [grunts] - I got you, son. I got you. [Gabe] There's the opening. When I get up there, I'll hook up the line and you follow me up. - OK? - All right. - The other one is following. - I'll move to a high point, flank him. Don't kill him until you get the money. Sure. [man] Mr. Wright, we found the ID. on the dead pilot. He was known to fly for Qualen. Over. [Walter] Well, what about the Treasury jet? Over. Its wreckage is scattered over a two-mile area. No bodies have been found. Over. Finally. An F.A.A. satellite has located a downed aircraft. Head 110 miles south-southwest - of the park entrance. - OK. [man over radio] Treasury Control, get the rescued people on their way. We're headed straight there. One out. Center out. [strains] [groans] - [Gabe] I got it, Jess. - [Jessie] Yeah. [Gabe] We're almost out. I can chop through. [snow scraping] [Gabe groans] Jessie, come on up! OK! Walker. Small world, ain't it? Don't even think about it. Your life's on sale, Walker. The price is 30 million. - Where is it? - It's gone. What the fuck are you talking about? Where's the money? I burned it. Never could save anything. Not even a dumb mountain boy like you would burn $30 million. I don't make deals, Walker, but I'll make one with you. Hand over the money, and I'll just kill you and not the girl. Now, give me the money! Gabe? All right. [Jessie] Gabe. Come on up. Come on! - Can you walk? - Yeah. Kynette, what's going on? Where's the money? - He said he torched it. - [Qualen] Where is he now? He dropped down into some cave. You've had your chance. Move it out now. - Kristel, get the C-4. - [Kristel] Roger. Just give me five minutes. I said get the fuck out of there. Good. And blow up that black bastard while you're at it. Save me the time of doing it myself. [Kynette grunts] It you want me, I'll be here! I'm in here! I'm in here. You're making it too easy for me. No! [Jessie groans] [groaning] No bullets, bitch! Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times, where's the money? Sissy. You hit like a sissy. [Kynette groans] Wrong answer, motherfucker! Get up! Now, I'm gonna ask you for a second time. Where is the money? Burned it. Wrong answer! [impact grunt] [Gabe groans] Time to kill a mountain man. It amazes me, in this day and age, when a man will put money before the personal safety of himself and his bitch. At least you can go to your grave knowing that I'm gonna treat the bitch... right! [grunts] Gabe, are you OK? Oh, God! Oh, God! I thought he killed you! - Are you OK? - Yeah. I'm all right. [Frank] Hal, Jessie, do you read? Again, do you read? Come in. Hal, Jessie, what the hell's going on up there? Jessie, find it. It's ready. [Frank] Rescue 1, Rescue 2. - Do you copy? Over. - Here it is! Here it is! [Frank] I found Evan in the east valley. He's got a gunshot wound in the back. He's en route to the medical center in Granby in critical condition. In case you can hear this, I'm resuming my search. Come on! You'll make somebody a fine wife someday. You should see me bake a cake. [timer beeping] He's still alive, for another four minutes. [Travers] Where's it set? [Qualen] Primed to go off right over his head. Fuck! Gabe, three minutes! There's a bomb! Get the hell out of there! There's a bomb over your head! Gabe... Jessie, get the gear! [groans] [coughs] Come on, Jessie. This way. That charge is gonna cause a landslide. We gotta get to the west face. Why the hell are we wasting time? Making sure he's not going to find that last case. You want to kill me, don't you, Tucker? Well, take a number and get in line. All right, the ledge is too far. Take this rope and pull it apart and tie it together. - We're gonna rappel down. - This rope is 60 years old. - Will it hold? - Don't think so. Bad answer. [timer beeping] [helicopter whirring] - Frank! Frank! - Frank! Frank! - No, Frank! - He can't see you, Jess. He can't see you. Go! Here comes our ride. Move. [Gabe] OK, now, swing as hard as you can. Push! [Jessie screaming] Gabe... [beeping] [groans] Jump. [Jessie grunts] [groans] Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! No! Frank! What's happening here? Where's the rest of the group? Welcome. What are you doing? Now, back off! Well, I came here to help you. [Delmar] You did. Don't move. - [Hal groans] - [Qualen chuckles] - [Hal] Frank! Frank! - [Qualen] Better hurry, Tucker. A friend in need. [Hal] Get the hell out of here! Frank! [Hal] No! You stupid maniac! - No one told you to shoot. - We've wasted enough time. Frank? [Hal breathing heavily] [mumbles] [Hal] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [helicopter blades whirring] This man never hurt anybody! Touching. Kristel, check the chopper. Let's go. [timer beeping] Get back! Get back! Go! Jessie, run! [Jessie groans] [Gabe groans] [Kristel groans] That son of a bitch. All right. We use a chopper to locate the third case. - Then we get the hell out of here. - No. There's not enough fuel to search around. Just enough to get us down. You're not running things, Travers. As soon as he finds the money, you're as dead as me. Give me the monitor. Now. [beeping] - What's the code, Travers? - [Travers] I told you, Qualen. Fifty thousand possible key code combinations... in 15-second intervals. So, what's the fucking code? [gun cocking] Well, look what Agent Travers found. I guess he is running things after all. Isn't he? So what's the plan, Travers? We use the chopper to find the money. Right? What a good idea. But then again... without a pilot... nobody even gets off this mountain. What are you doing, Eric? - Do you know what real love is, Kristel? - No. Sacrifice. [Kristel groans] Now I'm the only one who can fly us out of here. We're partners again. Now, take your toy... and find our money. Radio when you find it. I'm waiting here. [both panting] All right, the last of the money's at Crockett River. [Jessie] If we take the northern ridge, we can get there first. [Gabe] Look, there is no "we." What I'm gonna do is go along the north trail to Bitker Ladder. And you go on to the station for help. [Jessie] Are you crazy? [Gabe] Look, if they find the money, Hal's dead. - Just get back there fast. - [Jessie] All right. [Walter] Roger, Control. But Where the hell are those National Guard choppers? Over. [man 2] They had a mechanical, sir. It's being worked on now. - Their E. T. A. is one hour. - [Walter] An hour? Well, you got to do better than that. Now, get a move on. Out. [Gabe pants] [strains] [metal clinking] [panting] [timer beeping] [Travers] Stop there. We're close. - I got it locked in. - [electronic beeps] So we're finished with him, yeah? Yeah. Do it quietly. Your insane boss just made enough noise for anyone within ten miles to hear us. It's been fun. Hey, Delmar. From me to you... you're an asshole. Yeah? And you're a loudmouth, punk slag - who's about to die. - [gun cocking] Maybe. But in a minute I'll be dead. You... will always be an asshole. So go ahead and shoot. I'm getting cold. Shoot! - Who's shooting? - [grunts] [Delmar] Tell me... do you like soccer? It's a great sport. I was a fucking good striker. Isn't that something? [grunts] Oh, God! Fuck you! Ah, you're swearing now. [groans] That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike. A lovely little chip shot. [groans] He dribbles past one defender... two defenders... three defenders. Striker lines up at the penalty spot. He focuses on the ball. The crowd is on its feet. - Striker moves to his left. - [Hal coughs] He draws back his foot. He comes in. [groans] [Delmar chuckles] [Hal groans] [Delmar screams] [gun cocking] Season's over, asshole! I said quietly. [beeping] [beeping] [grunts] [Travers panting] What the fuck is going on? This is not right. [device beeping] What the fuck! [breathing heavily] Shit! [device beeping faster] - [breathing heavily] - [beeping continues] [rabbit squeaks] Goddamn. Fuck you, Walker! Fucked Goddamn it! Come in, goddamn it. Have you got what we need? [Travers] It's Walker. The son of a bitch is still alive, Qua/en. No names. This is an open line. I don't give a shit, Eric Qualen! Had to be insane to tie up with a lowlife piece of shit like you anyway. They beat us. A couple of fucking mountain rangers beat us. Jesus Christ, that's Travers. Get a bead on that frequency. They beat the man no law agency ever could. Get off the radio. And I'm finding that pretty fucking hilarious, Qualen. Stop transmitting, you stupid bastard! It's hard to believe I sold out after 20 years and this is my payback? To run on a mountain with a fucking dirtbag like you! Travers, you've lost your mind. Lost it. Have I lost it? Fucking, yeah, I've lost it, Qualen! Pure, fucking Section Eight! [Travers panting] I gotta go. I'm on my last official manhunt. Adios, motherfucker! [groans] You got a bearing on that frequency yet? “Me“ Yes. Eight minutes away. [Travers panting] [Travers] You're dead, Walker! [Gabe grunts] [Gabe groans] [Travers panting] [groans] - [helicopter whirring] - [Jessie panting] Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! [grunts] I won, Walker! [gun cocking] Gabe! Gabe! Travers, come in. Travers, come in. Compliments of Delmar. Too late. You missed him. He decided to take a swim to Arizona. - Tucker. - [Hal] That's right. [Qualen] Congratulations. Qualen? It's all over. Walker. You resilient bastard. So you're still alive. I want that money, and I want it now. Qualen, the game's over. You lost. Oh, no. The game's just getting interesting. I'm airborne now, you see. As a matter of fact, I've picked up a passenger I think you might be interested in. Go on, talk. I said talk, goddamn it! Gabe. Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry. I thought he was Frank. You get the picture, Walker? Now, I want that money. Meet me at the highest point from where you are. It you don't, we're going to find out it this little angel of yours can fly. Jessie, take him to the highest point near Bitker Ladder. I'll meet you there. Don't worry. Love's a killer, isn't it? Where are you, Walker? [Gabe] You're getting warmer. Keep climbing. You're getting closer, Qualen. Look out. [Qualen] I must admit, you're a real piece of work. Yeah, and I must admit, you're a real piece of shit. Throw it up, or I'll kill her. You do, and the cash is gone. The money. I want you to put her down. Over there! Jessie, run! - What about you? - Run! Run! Come on, Qualen. I got what you want. Come on. [Gabe] Come on. Come and get it. Come on. Closer. Come on, closer. - A little closer, Qua/en. - Throw it in. Bring it closer. Oh, my God. Throw it in. Damn you, Walker! Run! [screaming] [grunts] Jessie, move, move! Come on. [grunting] [screams] [Hal] Gabe! [Gabe screams and groans] [Qualen groans] [Gabe groans] It's just us now, you piece of shit. [Jessie] Gabe! Watch out! Get out of there, man! Stick around. We had a deal... and now we've just got each other. You're not afraid to die. [screams] Come on, get him! - [Jessie] Gabe! - Get out of there! [Jessie] It's gonna fall! Remember, shithead. Keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times! [Qualen groans] [screams] [Hal] Give me the rope! [groans] OK. I'm out of here. [Gabe groans] Gabe, buddy, you think you could have put a little less effort in that climb? I mean, I thought you were in shape. [Gabe gasping] - I guess I'm just falling apart. - Yeah. This is Agent Wright. Copy? Yeah, copy. [Wright] Please identify yourselves. Over. [Hal] Yeah, this is Hal Tucker, Rocky Mountain Rescue. Hey, we're glad to see you guys. If you're looking for Mr. Qualen... try about 4,000 feet south of here. He'll be the one wearing a helicopter. Over. [Wright] Good. 17! arrange transportation for the three of you. You can sit tight for a while.
