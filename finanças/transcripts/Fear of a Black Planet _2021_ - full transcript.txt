I should've never let you in here. You shouldn't have gotten mixed in with those guys. What are you afraid of? Why'd you leave so early? I wanted to make you breakfast. Yeah, I know, I'll be able to make you breakfast every day. Yeah, no, me, I gotta go pick up my assignment. I'm not sure yet, but I'm hoping it's not far. You know, L.A. traffic is already a nightmare. Okay, babe, I'll see you tonight? Love you too. Bye. The country is in a complete civil race war. Is someone shooting? God, move, move! Not again. Call me back, call me back, I need you! I'm downtown near 10th! Hey, hey. I hear you, somebody in there? Somebody? Yo, bitch! Yo, bitch, I know you in there! I hear you! I'm coming for your ass! Yeah, we'll be back! What the fuck? Let's go, cover your head! They finally did it. Who finally did what? This has been coming. For anybody listening, watching. This has been coming. I have to see what's going on. My car is out there. You know what's going on. You were already out there. Just getting worse. Do you have a phone I could use? Stopped working an hour ago. Well is there another way out of here? What about that door? It's just storage. This is the safest place in the city right now. What are you, some kind of artist? Bingo, what gave me away? All my dirty paintbrushes? Or my high fashion wardrobe? What's a white girl doing living down here? You slumming? Till my splashes of color can actually make me money, warehouse in the hood is all a white girl can afford. We just heard a big explosion. Not more than a block away from us. And a gang of men, a gang of armed men have been going back and forth from each other. There's been looting everywhere. This is Fabia Lopez, back to you at the studio. Let's get out of here. Might as well make ourselves comfortable. There's not much we can do. Just ride it out. This is not just some wave that will come and go. No, you're right. Like all waves, there'll be another one after this. And another one after that. You don't look like a surfer. I'm not. Just a student of history and human behavior. Called some of my friends. They should be here by now. Thought you said the phone stopped working. It did. I talked to him this morning. They're coming in from out of town. We did it, Pops. I got my badge today. Yeah. I know you always wanted a boy to follow in the family legacy. But I guess it was me, huh? And I promise I'm gonna be the best cop you ever saw. We should stay away from the windows. We don't want anyone to see us. No. We can't just sit here and do nothing. - We have to do... - What? We have to what? The world is on fire. If we go out there, we'll burn with it. Well you might be okay with just sitting and watching it burn, but I'm not. There's nothing we can do. Who do you think you are, some kind of wonder woman? No. I'm a... Ric, where are you? I'm okay, I'm... I don't even know what happened. I was leaving downtown from work when everything happened. Yes, yes, I'm safe right now, I'm... I'm in a warehouse building near Central. What's the address here? There's no address outside. Just middle of the block on 14th, red door. Middle of the block on 14th, red door. I'll look out for you. What's going on? I can't see anything. This is crazy. I mean, they always said something like this would happen, but I never thought... Just be safe and get here as fast as you can. Okay? Okay, I love you. Fuck. I think there's somebody out there. What are you talking about? I think I see somebody, but I'm not sure. It's a little girl. Is she alive? I don't know. I'm going out there. Go to the window and look out for me. If you see something, you see anyone, yell out. Can you open the door for me? I'll be right back. Hey. Hey. You all right? Are you hurt? Fuck. I always wanted myself a black... Now you're next. Can't run from me! I see, no, I'm not there! Am I there? I'm everywhere! You can't hide from me, I see you! You! Nova, it's me! It's me, let me in! Nova! Need you to let me in, please! Now, now! I know you're afraid, please. Please. Please, please. You all right, sister? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. Good. I saw that motherfucker trying to go after you. But we ain't having that today, not no more. We cleaning house today. Getting rid of all those white devils. You alone in here, sister? Yeah. This is my studio. You read a lot, that's good. We need smart black women to raise our children. The white devils have been poisoning them with lies about us. Yo, Adisa! Yo, man. Yo, dog, come on, man. They coming, man, come on, bro. They coming! Come with us, sister. We ain't free yet, there's a lot of fighting to be done. No. I'm gonna stay here. Yo, man! Come on! You can breathe now. They're gone. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened to me. I froze. Forget it. What about the little girl? It wasn't real, it was a doll. A doll? Forget it. We've got other things to worry about. It's gonna get dark soon. And things are probably only gonna get a lot worse. Come on. Oh great. Somebody must have cut the lines. I thought you said... They must have fixed it. Nova. Yes, but... It's not a problem, she's... Okay. Okay. I'll do what you say. Good news, friends are all right. Just taking longer to get here. Pick up, pick up. Damn. What do we do now? You're kidding. Oh my god. I don't feel like drinking. Oh, come on. It's the end of everything we know outside. You and I should both be dead right now. That's at least worth a drink. Okay, fine. Give me it, you talked me into it. Cheers. Cheers. You got somewhere to be? Yes. No, I... I was going to visit my father. He gave me this watch. I was going to visit his grave to tell him something. Your father's dead? Yeah. Three years now. When he gave me this watch, he said, "There's always time to do the right thing." I try to remember that when times get tough. What were you gonna tell your dad? What? You said that you were on the way to the cemetery to tell your father something. What was it? You don't seem worried about all this. I mean, it's like you said, it is the end of the world. Don't you care? I care. There'll be something after all this. Is that what it says in "The White Wave"? What? The book on the table. It's just a book a friend gave me. I know a lot of crazy people. Lestor, he's got a lot of crazy ideas about the world. This the same friend that's on the way? Who, Lestor? Yeah. Him and some others. Some others with crazy ideas? You ask a lot of questions. You a cop? What's in the van? I don't know, cleaning supplies? It belongs to Lestor. That's why he's coming, to pick it up. Must be something pretty important to drive through a war to pick up a van. You should've never came here. What's in the van, Nova? You put something in my drink? Why? Why? Why? Why, why did you do this? What have we here? She's still breathing. Love. Well, shit. Man, stay out of it... Come on, man, this is the time... Don't you fucking touch... Whoa, what is your problem, man? Don't fucking touch me, don't touch me. You find some rope, I want you to guys tie her up, set her off to the side, we'll figure out what to do with her later. Right now we gotta get our shit together, cause we got somewhere to be, don't we? Go grab the rope, man. He told you to get the rope, dumb. Baby? What's wrong, couldn't sleep? Must've been thinking about me, huh? Shut up. No, I... I just had the craziest dream. I can't even remember. I was alone, and I kept calling you, but you weren't there. Well I'm here now. What was it that you wanted? What? In your dream, you said you were calling me. All right, here I am. What'd you want? I... I can't remember. I got an idea. What? I was kinda planning this for another time. This kinda seems like the right time, right place. Just a picture, I'm always here when you need me. In your dreams or when you're awake. Fay, will you do me the honor of being my wife? Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes. - Yes? - Yeah. - Yes. - You gonna put it on, or you just gonna look at it? I don't know. I don't even know. Oh. - I love you. - I love you. Oh, god. Fuck. Hello? Okay. Fuck, fuck. Ric, Ric? Where are you? I'm in trouble. Please. I'm in trouble. Ric. I'm in trouble. I'm with some bad people. Okay. Come on, girl. Okay, no one can help you but you, no one can help you but you. Okay. Nova, I've been thinking about you a lot lately, living in that dark little cave of yours. Having had everything taken from you, passed off and given to people who didn't deserve it, who didn't earn it, who haven't worked hard. I've begun to think that maybe God has a plan for you. A good white woman with nothing. It's my belief that God wants us to fight back, to fight for change. To take it back. All federal buildings are on high alert, but law enforcement resources are spread very thin. It's safe to say right now that each man is for himself. This is the known symbol of their militia. If you see something, say something. Who are you? Are you hurt? Okay. All right. Okay. Okay, oh my god, okay. Okay, okay, okay, one second. Okay, okay, okay. Oh my god. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. You're all right now, you're all right. You're all right, you're all right. Okay, okay, oh man. Where are they? There's no one here right now, they're all gone. We can't stay here, we gotta go. Okay, okay. Can you stand? I'll help you, help you. Okay, on three, one, two. Three. Okay, come on, okay. Okay, okay. I can't walk! What happened? They jumped me, beat me up. I thought they was gonna kill me. Who? Who did this? I don't know who they are. Skinheads, white boys. Some guy they call Lestor. Lestor, what, fuck. Okay, okay. Stay with me, stay with me. Hey, hey, hey, come on, stay with me. Hey, hey. I don't wanna be here when they get back. We can't go outside, it's not safe. We're not safe here. Can we lock the door - or something? - No, no. No, they have a key. That won't keep them out. What is it, what is it? What's in the van, what's in the van? Chemicals, dangerous stuff. My god. I was on my way to the plant and dump when they jumped me. Did they say what they were gonna do with the stuff? No. But I'm pretty sure it's some crazy let's kill a lot of black folk shit. Okay, okay, listen to me. We have to stop them, okay? How you think we gonna do that? I can't even walk. I'm a cop. You a cop. You don't even look like a cop. Well I just graduated from the academy, and they still haven't given me my assignment, but yes, I'm a cop. Good for you. Now what? Okay, okay, okay. I have a gun. It's in my car, come on. I have to go and get it. Hey. Can you let me in if I come back? Can you do that, I need yes, yes or no. Yes, yes? Okay, okay, good, good, good. Lock the door, listen for me. I'll be right back, I promise. Okay. All right. - Now it's as if we... - Guys, bro? I told you we should've killed that black girl before we left. God, why did we bring this kid with us? This ain't no time to get your nuts... - The fuck is your problem? - Stop, enough, all right, both of you knock it off! We've got bigger fish to fry. I want you to get the driver into the truck with the explosives, and I want this rig ready to go within the hour, am I understood? Now where the fuck fuck is my... Don't move! Drop your weapons on the floor. Do it now, or I'll shoot. Now kick your weapons towards the walls. Now what? You gonna shoot all of us? I'm gonna shoot you if you don't shut the fuck up. Do it, you can't stop what's coming. - Don't make me. - Hm? Fuck. That bitch almost shot my foot off! Yo man, she locked herself in the van, you idiot! Fuck the van, what about my foot? All right, both of you shut up a second. Now she's got the detonator, and we can't arm the explosives without it. Just shoot the lock off. Are you fucking stupid? Do you remember what we just loaded in there? You blow the lock off, you blow the whole building apart and us with it. Told you this kid was a moron. Okay, we can't blow the lock off, she ain't coming out on her own, so how do we get that black bitch out of there? Just get my tools. Hey, uh, lady? Can we talk about this a second? Ain't nothing to talk about. I ain't opening that door. I think you got me and my boys out here all wrong. Oh yeah, you're just a bunch of boy scouts, right? Well, I mean, you know, there's some materials in there that are very dangerous, and if you're not careful, you're gonna get yourself hurt. We all might get hurt if you don't back off. Okay, listen. I'm gonna go ahead and introduce myself proper-like now. I am the big bad wolf, and one way or another, I am coming in there. Now are you really gonna make me huff and puff before I blow your fucking house in! Time's almost up, Miss! We gonna do this the easy way or the messy way? Okay, messy way it is. Oh shit! It's gonna get a lot messier than that if you come any closer. Are you trying to get yourself blown up, you stupid bitch? If I go, we all go, you dumb white motherfucker. Leave her alone. She's a nice person. Nova? Is that you? Why did you come back? You didn't have to. Why did you come back? I can't explain it. You saved me. I didn't wanna drug you. But I had to, or they would've killed you on sight. Then help me. Do something. No. She ain't gonna do shit. She belongs to me. Nova. Just tell them to back away from the van, and I'll come out. Why? What are you gonna do then? I'll give you what you want. Just give me the van driver and I'll leave if you just let me have him. You want a half dead driver? You can have him, my gift to you. I mean, he's probably not gonna make it till morning anyway. We've got a deal. Back away from the van, and I'll come out. Back up. She said that she'll come out if you back up. Nova. You're not, you're not gonna shoot me. You're a good person. You may have gotten into it with the wrong people, but you're not like them. No. Put it down. Yeah. Okay. Nova. What are you doing? You know you can't trust them. Nova, don't listen to him. You remember what you told me? What they did to you when you were a little girl? How they hurt you? Never gonna let that happen again, are you? Never again. Okay, synced up. Put that in the truck. Wrap this shit show up, people. Wheels up in five minutes. Dallas, gas up the truck, I want it topped off. Got it. Yeah, we're good. It's okay. Why are you doing this? I could tell you the story about how when I was a little kid, I got jumped every day by a bunch of big black kids in my neighborhood. Or I could tell you the story about how my dad lost his job because the company had to fill some bullshit quota. No, I know the one you wanna hear. You wanna hear the one about how some drunk nigger fucking ran his car into my wife's at 80 miles an hour, and what I had to say at her funeral. Is that true? Does it matter? It could all be true, or none of it. It still wouldn't change the fact that you will never understand this white man's burden. Hour from now, things go boom. What do we do with her? Fuck it, throw her in the truck, it's more body parts for the cleanup crew. In another life, you and I would've had some fun before I did this. Whoa, whoa. Hey, friend. Oh, sorry, I thought you were another one of them crazy monkeys with a gun. Nah, I heard the noise, man. Needed to get out of the street. It's crazy out there. Yeah. About to get crazy here too. Say I find myself in need of another able-bodied individual. I don't suppose you'd be willing to join us? Looks like you're up to something big. I like big stuff. Big stuff, I like that. Well big stuff, we're about to go get ourselves a whole lot of money. What are you talking about? While the world is burning, we're gonna go rob a bank. The World Bank, in fact. And they got enough money in there that you can live whatever kind of life you want. So you're robbing a bank in the middle of a riot. Well, best time to steal shit's when no one's looking, right? We're just gonna drive down there, blow a hole in the wall and walk out with everything they got. Hey, why are you telling him? Because your stupid ass went and got shot and we need somebody else who can drive the van. So what do you say, big stuff? Are you in? Or are you out? I'm in. All right, let's get this show on the road. This bitch is a cop. What? Fucking bitch. He's with her. God damn it. All right, I'll tell you what, big stuff. I'm gonna blow your girlfriend's pretty face off. Do it and you're dead. Drop your fucking gun. - You first! - I will shoot her! You wanna see her brains all over the fucking floor? I can't let you leave here. Put the fucking gun down, you fucking nigger lover. Put the gun down now! Ah, fuck. So much for the white wave, huh? I should've never let you in here. You shouldn't have got mixed in with those guys. I still gotta sacrifice for what I believe. You see, it's not too late for the revolution. What are you afraid of? If we let the monkeys out of the cage, they'll remember how we treated them. Okay, okay, okay. Hey, beautiful. What took you so long? Little bit of traffic, babe. - Ah, fuck. - Can you stand? I think so. Help me up. God. God. I can't go any further. Okay, okay. I'm staying with you. I'm scared. I know. Me too.
