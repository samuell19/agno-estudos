[Heather] You were omniscient in people's lives. And, you've literally just kind of, hovered over... their area. And, sometimes you would watch them for days and then you'd have intel that... That this guy is a bad guy. And, you wait till he walks out to the field to meet with some friends for something, and you'd blow him up. Drop a Hellfire missile on him. [Heather] Are you guys gonna have anything to drink tonight? -[woman 2] Oh yes, just water. -[woman 3] I'll have a soda, please. All right. There you go. And, the bottle of water is back there, then if you wanna grab one. Thanks, guys. Have a good night. [Heather] I originally was interested in Navy at first, because the guy that I was dating had been in the Navy, and I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll just join the Navy", you know, travel, and see the world, and fight for my country and protect people from terrorists. And, I ended up being recruited into the Air Force because I actually saw the posters with the drones, and, I was like, "Wow, that is so cool", like unmanned aircraft. Like, that's really badass. And I was still like, under the impression that America was saving the world. Like, that we were Big Brother, and we were helping everyone out. So, when I saw this possibility that I could get out of like, this small town that I was in, get out of Pennsylvania, and just travel, and I thought that was the only way to do it. And, they didn't make it seem like you would be that, one of your only options of places to go is Afghanistan. [digital beeping] -[man] Titan 1-4, hold your position. -[man 2] What d'ya got? Unmanned aircraft is identifying enemy sniper. Copy that. Let's move. [Heather] I was in the military prior to being in massage school. I got out two years ago. I was in Air Force Intelligence, I flew the drones. I was part of a unit that... we fought in Afghanistan, and I've lost friends to the war. I've lost friends to suicide that were a part of that unit. And, I've seen a lot of people die... in the war. So, for me, I brought to the massage table pain, and just absolute despair. And, memories, like... horrible memories. And, along with that is an anxiety disorder and a sleep disorder. And, I thought... you know, I came here, I think, subconsciously looking for healing for myself. To be able to find something that in learning to heal other people, maybe I could heal myself as well. [somber music playing] It was like slow motion. And it was like you're watching someone just drag themself across the field. When you watch someone in those dying moments, what their reaction is, how they're reacting, and what they're doing, [sighs] it's so primitive. It's really raw, stripped down death. That's what it is. This is real. Like, this isn't... It's not a joke. I have specific memories of any of them, that I know I killed. But, it's so messy, and they don't report it down to us who we killed. Maybe we killed our objective, maybe we killed a guy who we thought was our objective. You don't know. And, I can say the drone program's wrong, because, I don't know how many people I've killed. After we do a strike, I'd ask for a break, and, like, go outside and smoke a cigarette, and just think, and, like, try to decompress and just try to... push the idea that I was involved in killing people, uh, out of my mind and try not to think about it. Sometimes if I couldn't really get out of this situation for very long, I would just go to the bathroom, and just sit on the toilet. Like, just sit there in my uniform and just, like, cry. And just think about like, what I was doing. It was just different emotional responses. I mean, a lot of times afterwards I would feel just empty, and, if I was crying, it was because I just didn't... know how to stop feeling like that. How to stop feeling like a shell. And, it was... that empty void. And it was, it was like always shaking after we'd do a strike, 'cause there's such an adrenalin rush, you're killing someone. You see someone die because you said it was okay to kill them. [man] This is the future and it's already here. The predator, it just doesn't give up, it doesn't quit. It will find you, it will hunt you down. You step into the ground control station, which is your cockpit, you immediately feel like you're in an airplane. It's kind of like, having an eagle, or, something over your head, constantly planning on your arm, reporting what's going on. [Heather] It's a spy in the sky, really. Lets them see what they need to see. [man] It's really a good feeling to know that you're helping the guys on the ground. That's really why I think all of us do it. Being part of the Air Force makes me feel proud. When people tell me, "Thank you", that's when I remember I'm doing something bigger than me. Before I joined the military, I was, well aware that what I was about to enter was something that I was against. That I disagreed with, I joined anyways out of desperation because I was homeless, I was desperate, I had nowhere else to go. I was on my last leg, and, the Air Force was ready to accept me. I still work in Intelligence, as a contractor, basically until I can go to school, in the fall semester. And, I still have a top secret clearance. Uh, it's... Once you're given a top secret clearance it's good for five years, and then it needs to be renewed every five years. And, when I leave this job, my clearance will expire. Nobody ever thinks about speaking out, against the government, who's worked for them and hasn't considered what the possible consequences are. But, I don't dwell on them because I don't... I don't want it to effect my voice. I don't want it to silence my words or to curtail my speech. I generally feel like they don't... "They" being the government, "they" being the Justice Department, they shouldn't hold that power over me. This ominous threat that they'll go after me in the same way that they've gone after so many people. Specially since 9/11. I didn't find out what I was gonna be doing until I made it to Fort Bragg, for the Joint Special Operations Command. At the time, I didn't really realize the significance, or the importance of the organization itself. I'd simply been told by some people in the military, "Oh, they're kind of like, the elite". Special Ops people that you hear about in video games, and in movies. That they were actually responsible for the killing of Osama Bin Laden. So, I would find targets using signals intelligence. You know, I was stationed at Fort Meade, which is where NSA is headquartered. I had a clearance for NSA, I was... so... you know, NSA is the Intelligence Directorate which handles signals intelligence. So naturally, I would be put in to a position, you know, overseas, working in a signals intelligence capacity. And, using... the technology on the drone through... a means of signals intelligence... Sorry, it's really... really tough... I know... it's core and it's central to what I was doing and like, my whole reason for speaking here... So, but I'm also very unaware where that line is drawn. And, um... So, I had to be very extraordinarily cautious about what I can and can't say on camera. The... Though it's something so simple and so benign that you wouldn't imagine, it were even... of, you know, it would even have concerned... There's still... there's no, there's no doubt in my mind that if I said the wrong... the wrong thing or gave away the wrong kind of information about what I was doing, that I... that I wouldn't... that I would be, you know, safe from prosecution of any kind. [somber music playing] [Lisa] When I first got into the military, I mean, I was thinking it was kind of a win-win. It was a force for good in the world. I could actually help people, I could go places, I could learn things, there was nothing negative about it at the time that was in my thinking or in my consciousness. And, you know, I thought I was gonna be on the right side of history, and today, I don't believe I was. [crows cawing] [Lisa] I worked on a DGS, a Distributed Ground System. As the name implies, I mean, it's a distributed system, and, it spans the globe, and it eats data. And, it eats lots, and lots, and lots of data. This is global. This is getting information anywhere at anytime, shooting people from anywhere at anytime, and it's not just one person sitting there, with a little remote control, a little joystick, moving around a plane that's halfway across the world. That's not all there is. It's like, borders don't matter anymore, and, there's a huge system that spans the globe, that can just suck up endless amounts of your life, your personal data. I mean, this could grow to get so out of control, and we're not the only ones that have this. This is gonna be commonplace, if it's not already. It's a secret program. And what that means is that I can't just go shouting off the hill tops telling the public what it is. What I can tell you, is that to me, one person who worked within this massive thing, it's frightening. Okay, let me find the beginning of this really long sentence. "Sgt. Ling also spearheaded the emissions security and accreditation process "for four Coalition Computer Networks, "enabling the exploitation of 2400 sorties "and resulting in the timely and accurate identification "of 121,000 insurgent targets "in support of operations Iraqi Freedom "and Enduring Freedom." And, then it goes on. That means that the system that I worked on... basically identified 121,000 insurgent targets. It's 121,000 lives, affected by technology that we control. And in this case, you're talking about a two-year period. So, how many years have we been at war now? It's 12. Multiply, add up some numbers, and see what's really going on. [man] Dear Lord, we thank you for this beautiful day. We thank you for friends and family, we thank you for everyone, everything that you've given us. Bless this food and nourish our bodies, keep everyone safe in their travel. Amen. Did you ever [Heather] I was an imagery analyst and a screener. My job was to watch what's happening, in the video of the drones, the live video, of course, and identify everything. Another remote duty station, you'd have the pilot, of course, who's flying the actual aircraft, and the sensor operator, who is moving the camera around. They were the ones that actually push the button. I do not push the button, I just identify what... what necessitates a button pushing. [somber music playing] We can't just bomb someone and fly away. We have to follow through. The bomb hit, and wait for it to cool down a little bit, and then you can see, like, the body parts. You can identify, like, that could be the lower half of his body, that could be a leg. And then... Sometimes you'll stick around and watch family come and get them. Or, like, pick up the parts, and put their family member in a blanket. And a couple of people will hold on to a corner of the blanket and carry them back to their compound. According to my mental health records, I was high risk for suicide because of the way I acted about my job. My psychologist called my First Sergeant and he recommended that I be possibly moved to anything that... wasn't involving watching people die all the time. And the First Sergeant said that our team was undermanned, and that they absolutely needed me to work mission, so, he would look into it, but never returned my psychologist's phone calls, never gave him any indications that I was... gonna be moved to a better job. And I obviously wasn't. I stayed doing that job until the last possible moment when they had to let me out of process because I was actually getting out of the military. So, I guess that's the cost of a human life, because the fact that I was on a suicide watchlist and they still wouldn't allow me to do something else that might help me a little bit obviously didn't matter to the military, and that... that shows how much the Air Force cares about its intelligence troops. [wind chime dinging] Look down the bottom there. There's ice on the steps too. [Heather's mom] You could tell she'd had a stressful day, if she'd call me up and she'd be crying, or she'd be upset. But then, she couldn't talk about it. And then, when you ask her, "Can you talk to anybody else about it?" "Well no, we're not supposed to talk to anybody". So, she... was having more and more issues, each day that things went on. A mom knows these things, and then, when you hear your daughter, talking to you on the phone, and you can tell that she's in trouble just by the emotion and the inflection, in the stress that you can hear in her voice, I knew she was in trouble. And, the only thing I could do is just stay in touch with her on a daily basis, so she felt like she had someone there. Because I have a feeling if somebody was there for her, she wouldn't be here right now. And her friends, a lot of them, were in the same boat she was. All drinking. All carrying on. Trying to forget the pain. [woman on radio] I'm just scared, I'm always scared. All those little kids were just scared to go outside. Now, I would like to play a clip of President Obama, addressing US drone warfare, at National Defense University in Washington DC. [Obama] And before any strike is taken, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured. The highest standard we can set. Yes, the conflict with Al Qaeda, like all armed conflict, invites tragedy. But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us, and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely, to result in the loss of innocent life. [Daniel] When the President gets up in front of the nation and says that they're doing everything they can to ensure that there's near certainty that there will be no civilians killed, he is saying that, because, he can't say otherwise. Because, any time, an action is taken to finish a target, there is a certain amount of guesswork in that action. Because it's only in the aftermath of any kind of ordinance being dropped, that you know just how much actual damage was done. And, often times... the intelligence committee is reliant, the Joint Special Operations Command, the CIA included, is reliant on intelligence coming afterwards, that confirms that who they were targeting was killed in that strike. Or that they weren't killed in that strike. [somber music playing] [Lisa] We all know people die in war. We all know that. If we don't, we're deluded. The fact of the matter is, is that these things, these devices, can go pretty much unimpeded anywhere in the world, and blow crap up. And there's no single governing body about how they're used, and that is something that will promote war. Not deter it. The people that really get the impact, aside from the people at the distant end who are getting hit by these weapons are all these new recruits that are coming in. And the people that are being affected are America's children. People die, things get destroyed, and people who are aged 18 to 24, sit and watch it. How can anyone not find that disturbing? [Heather] Hearing politicians speak about drones being precision weapons, being able to make surgical strikes, to me, it's completely ridiculous. It's completely ludicrous to even make those statements. It's as flawed as it can be with people operating it from across the world. If they really think they can send a bomb through a window of a compound and hit one militant, then why are we seeing so many civilians dying as collateral damage. I'd like to ask those politicians, have they not been notified of that? Do they not know what's going on in their own war that they're controlling? [music playing] A former US drone operator and analyst has slammed American and British militaries for fabricating faulty information on the civilian deaths in the US-led drone war worldwide. Heather Linebaugh has questioned the accuracy of the information collected by the drone saying, "The videos provided are not clear enough to detect militants from civilians." The former American analyst also said that the drones in the US-led wars are not used as protection but rather as a weapon. [Heather] This is a perfect example of what it would look like. Unaltered. This is probably the best you'd get on a good day. It's why it's so difficult to make that choice. I'd say there's at least two possible, possible children. And then, one of them runs away. [somber music playing] [sighs] [cries] It's like, I care because of what I've seen, happen to, like, my fellow veterans and stuff, like, what I've seen happen to people. Like, my friends have suffered so much, I've had so many friends that are, like, "Oh man, I can't live with myself for what I did in Iraq, like, "I can't live with myself for the things that I've done." And this isn't just for myself, like, this isn't some kind of self-healing thing for me. Like, I've found more self-healing through doing massage and everything. This isn't even that therapeutic for me. Every time I do one of these things I'm like, I feel awful. 'Cause then I have to talk about it and tell people about it and all kinds of stuff, and people think that my stories are all mega-important or something. And it's... I'm not saying this for like, the importance of... myself. I'm saying it because, I need to say it because my other veteran friends are, like, too drunk to spend time to say anything about it or they're not around anymore. Trying to just get people to change how they view things are, like, policy makers aren't listening. Policy makers don't care. It's not gonna change anything. So, I'm gonna put myself out there at risk. Being put on some kind of FBI watchlist or something for just saying that, "Yeah, the drone program makes people feel bad." Like, I'm basically saying, the drone program can give you Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That shouldn't be a surprise, and like... for me to just say something like that and then have people say it's not gonna make a change, "You're gonna be the next Edward Snowden," it just... it pisses me off, like... And it makes me not even wanna try, because, if I'm gonna get all this awful horrifying attention from the government and stuff, like... What's the point? If someone comes to my house and puts a bag over my head and hauls me away, then what was the point of anything I did? Am I really changing people's minds? Or are people just gonna share it on Facebook and then move along? [sniffles] I'm spending all this time doing all this stuff and it could be for absolutely nothing. [sniffles] Like, I could be... living a normal life, spending time with friends, spending time with family. And like, I'm spending all this time for this thing, that I don't know if anybody's even gonna care about. And I don't know if anybody's gonna be like, "Oh, let's really care about these soldiers in the drone program, "'cause according to all that are Left, we're all a bunch of baby killers. "And according to the Right, we shouldn't be having any problems "'cause we're not walking around in Afghanistan." [man] Expose Facts is dedicated to supporting whistle-blowers, whistle-blowing, and independent journalism. Our next speaker, Jesselyn Radack, is a Director of National Security and Human Rights Program at the Government Accountability Project. As an attorney, she's represented many whistle-blowers, and I'll mention just a few of them. Edward Snowden, Thomas Drake, and John Kiriakou. So, Jesselyn Radack. I represent seven people investigated, charged, or prosecuted under the draconian Espionage Act. Espionage Act prosecutions occur largely in secret, and have been brutal. I hope that will change. I hope also that whistle-blower protection will be extended to protect people in the national security and intelligence arenas, who have made all of the bombshell disclosures about war crimes, about torture, about secret surveillance, that you've heard about over the past decade. [Heather] When the Guardian thing first happened, I was so scared 'cause everybody started calling me a whistle-blower and saying like, "This is another Edward Snowden". I didn't think I mentioned anything classified but they started saying, like, "She mentioned capabilities." Well, most whistle-blowers are not blowing the whistle on classified, and if they do have access to classified information, they're able to blow the whistle on things without ever getting into the classified. And, what you're disclosing that hasn't been out there, is the ill-effect and the horrible negative effect that this has had on the actual people doing the work. -Yeah. -And... On the innocent people being blown up, and the shaky legal reasoning. I mean, all three of these are the perfect storm, of this claustrofuck that we call the Drone Program. [rock music playing] From Pacifica, this is Democracy Now. America does not take strikes to punish individuals, we act against terrorists who pose a continuing, and imminent threat to the American people. And when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat. [woman on TV] In a major policy address on Thursday, President Obama defended the secret overseas drone war but said that the United States cannot continue waging what he described as a boundless global war on terror. Obama's comments came one day after Attorney General, Eric Holder, confirmed US drone strikes had killed four US citizens in Yemen and Pakistan. [Obama] Simply put, these strikes have saved lives. Moreover, America's actions are legal. We were attacked on 9/11. Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force. [Daniel] The people who defend drones and defend the way that they're used, they always say, they protect American lives by not putting them in harm's way. What they really do is, they just embolden commanders. They embolden decision makers. Because, there is no threat, there is no immediate consequence. They can do this strike and they can potentially kill this person, that they're so desperate to get and to eliminate, because of how dangerous, potentially dangerous they could be to US. But if it just so happens that they don't kill that person or some other people are involved in the strike, and get killed as well, you know, there's no consequence for it. When it comes to high value targets, every mission is to go after one person at a time. But anybody else that's killed in that strike is... just blatantly assumed to be an associate of the targeted individual. So as long as they can reasonably identify that all the people in the field of view of the camera are military-aged males, meaning anybody who is believed to be of age 16 or older, they are a legitimate target under the rules of engagement. If that strike occurs and kills all of them, they just say that they got 'em all. [indistinct chants] [woman] Okay, we'll take one more question for John McCain. Doesn't McCain have a daughter that's of military age? [woman 2] Oh, good idea! Send your daughter. Yeah! How about sending your daughter, John, what about that? [Daniel] People often times get mixed up in the anti-drone movement, trying to say that we should just ground drones and we should just eliminate drones from our lexicon and never allow them to exist in this world. It's just too dangerous. And I don't necessarily agree with them, because, drones are gonna be a part of our life here pretty soon. They're gonna be, most likely, they're gonna be doing things that, that we were only able to do with people in a plane before. It'll be like dusting crops, or planting seeds or doing humanitarian surveillance, during floods and disasters... to try and locate victims. You know, they're gonna be there. But there's also that other dangerous side to them that makes war so easy and so convenient, and so simple that the people who have access to this technology and access to this capability, just say, "Why wouldn't I use this? It's too easy". [somber music playing] The most disturbing thing about my involvement in drones is the uncertainty, if anybody that I was involved in kill or capture, was a civilian or not. There's no way of knowing. [Lisa] There's a bomb, they drop it... It explodes. Then what? Does somebody go down there and ask for somebody's driver's license? "Excuse me, sir, can I have your driver's license, see who you are." I mean, does that happen? How do we know? How is it possible to know who ends up living or dying? [woman] So, folks, welcome to the Commonwealth Club. We have the great privilege tonight to have a chance to talk with General Stanley McChrystal, who had a very distinguished 34-year career in the American military. His last assignment was as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force, in Afghanistan. Won't you Commonwealth Club members join me in welcoming Stan McChrystal. [Stan] Think about today's world. You can get information from everywhere in real time. You can talk to anyone in your organization. In my Situational Awareness Room where we called it, we had about 12 screens on the wall. And they were all showing operations in real time, full motion video, we called it. Like the live TV from Predator unmanned aerial vehicles above them. So, we could watch every one of our operators, landing a helicopter, get out of a vehicle, move on the target. And because of a system we set up that went through our secure Internet, we could hear every radio transmission and if I was sitting in Baghdad, I could hear radio transmissions from a raid in Afghanistan. And if I wanted to, I could reach down and talk to Sergeant X, on the ground, on an objective in Afghanistan. Now, I never did that but the technology now allows you to do that. So, the first thing to understand is that, that's deceptive. It's seductive and deceptive, because, if you see things in two dimension you get the opinion that you're at 10,000 feet, you see this photograph, you know what's going on. You don't know what's going on, You know what you see in two dimensions. [indistinct chatter] Lisa, L-I-S-A? Yup. And... I'm... Go on with the question, please. Okay, so, I'm very curious, I understand that you're... a little weary about the drone program, -Uh-huh. -and I'm wondering, what your... views of the program are. Yeah, I think drones are here to stay, and they're necessary. But you have to understand how people perceive things. So, it's one thing to do things, but it's another to anger a population in the process. So, I think you got to make that value decision, you gotta say... In each case you gotta make the decision, "Is it worth it?" Because, you are gonna create, you know, some ill-will in the process. I also think we need to explain it to the world better. But again, I'm not one of those people who thinks it's not gonna be around. -I mean, technology doesn't go back. -Oh, no. It doesn't. Yeah, once it's out of the bag, it's out of the bag. And it's not immoral or moral, but it has to be understood and it has to be described to people. It has to be very carefully used. I just think it's that important. Well, I just wanna say, thank you. I've read your book, and I so appreciate your understanding... Well, you're kind. Thank you so much. ...of the Afghan culture and all of that. It touched my heart. [indistinct chatter] [Lisa] One of my neighbors, her name's Asma, and she was born in Afghanistan. And she goes there every year distributing seeds, and doing humanitarian work, and Asma's willing to take me this year, and, it's a beautiful thing. I'm aware that Afghanistan is a dangerous place. I'm aware that there's still war going on there. But, I believe that doing this is the right thing to do. I lost part of my humanity working in the drone program. And, humanity was what was missing there. And seeing these people as human beings, it'll be nice to... To just see it up close. [slow music playing] [indistinct radio chatter] I bless you. [goats bleating] [indistinct chatter] [helicopter whirring] [speaking in foreign language] [Lisa] When I meet these people, part of it is making reparations for my participation in a program that's a huge, huge weapons system that kills more innocent people than actual targets. There's now way that I can make amends, or change anything that I've participated in. But if there's any way that I cam somehow give back to that country, that's what I wanna do. -Cucumber. -Cucumber. [speaking in foreign language] I said, give the ladies, too. -Hm-hm. -Okay? I wanna be able to be helpful, even just a little bit by talking to somebody who's been directly impacted, by the drone program. And asking, what do you need, what do you want people to hear? Basically, how can I be helpful because, being a part of a weapons system can't be helpful. It can only be hurtful. -Good morning, everybody. -Hi! You're finally here. Sorry... [indistinct chatter and laughing] [man] My feeling of her moving to California is mixed emotions. I feel it's an opportunity for her, but I'm concerned about a young lady being that far from home, without family support, that can't be nearby. And if she needs help, it would take some time for us to get help to her. [woman] She has episodes at least once or twice a week. Sees things, hears things... but it's so hard for our vets, and our soldiers, and men and women to get help. And with drone people, they consider that they didn't see combat, 'cause they weren't overseas. That's not the truth. They see a lot of combat. But nobody takes that into consideration. [man] That's not just my granddaughter, that's had trouble getting the treatment she needed. I know she has attempted to get help, and she had trouble finding therapists to talk to, because they didn't have the right security clearance, and she was in violation of the law and could go to prison, for even talking to the wrong therapist about what was really bothering her. That made me a little angry at our own government, for putting these kids through hell. If we put our young people in this kind of an environment, we have an obligation to look after them, to help them make the adjustment back to normal life. And, we're not doing that, and that's... Shame on us. [somber music playing] [Jesselyn] The government recently contacted two of the drone whistle-blowers, whom I represent. The government meaning, the Air Force Office of Special Investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, contacted them, told them that they were on some sort of terrorist kill list. In Heather's case, my understanding was that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations contacted her step-father to relay the message that, a known terrorist organization had been searching her name. And on the one had they said there was not... a specific or imminent threat. On the other hand, they had very tailored solutions for Heather, which was that she needed to tone down her social profile in general, and that would include writing op-eds, that would include the use of Twitter and Facebook. It's not like Heather's been out screaming from the roof top about drones, but clearly the government is very aware of the fact that she had written about drones before. To me, that's a blatant attempt to silence whistle-blowers and it doesn't surprise me that that happens to the very few people who have been brave enough to be speaking out against the drone program. [slow music playing] [Daniel] When they arrived, it was actually just hours after I had turned in my badge, and was finishing my last day. I had gotten home, was relaxing, had poured myself a drink, and somebody downstairs was knocking at the door, and immediately, both people at the door, men and women, shoved FBI badges in my face, pushed me inside into the kitchen, and immediately behind them came, I'd say about 20 agents. Basically all of them with pistols drawn, some were in body armor. At this point, I'm extremely scared. I didn't understand what was going on. All together, I think there might have been at least 30 to 50 agents, in and out of the house at different points throughout the evening, taking photos in every room and of everything, searching for different things, Once they were done, they left, and I didn't even have a phone on me, so I had retained a number. One of the agents allowed me to retrieve a number from my phone, and, then I used that to call my friends in DC, to ask them if they could, uh, if they could help me get in touch with the right people that, that knew how to deal with these kinds of cases. Once I was in touch with Daniel, we met at... one location, and promptly moved to another location. And he started telling me what was going on and, it became very apparent that he had been subject to search warrants that he had brought with him and showed me. And I drafted up an Attorney-Client agreement, a temporary one, on a napkin, so I could provide immediate representation then eventually was able to do a full agreement with him. But he was terrified. Everything that we know so far, between me and my attorneys, I've been keeping it in here. And it's basically just the warrants that were issued that day, and the items that they took. And, so there were three warrants issued, one for the room of the house that I was in, and the house itself... The... there's a warrant issued for me and my smartphone, that I may have in my possession. There's this... there's one for my motorcycle. And then there's... a list of all the things that they took. So basically there was a list for electronics, and there was a list for papers. The next was just an explanation of what they were looking for. So under category one, "Information documents in a format or medium, "all originals, computer files, copies "and manipulated versions of that "are the property of the United States government "or any agency of the United States government "including the NSA, the NGA, JSOC, "the Department of Defense, the Department of the Air Force. "All classified information materials or documents are defined in 18 USC 1924." So those five departments or agencies, however, you look at them, those are all places I have worked for. 793 E, and 1030 A1 B, 1030 A2 B, and 1924. So, I'd have to actually do some research on that, I should have probably done that. If I, uh... if I were more responsible for myself. But I'm pretty sure that all this intels generic blanket, this is a criminal investigation for the Espionage Act. [Jesselyn] The Espionage Act is one of the most serious charges you can level against an American. It's like treason. It's that serious because, basically it paints you as an enemy of the state. And it's a David versus Goliath struggle. It is a single person against the entire executive branch of the United States government. And that's the kind of power we're supposed to reserve for going after our enemies. Not after people who are patriotic. [slow music playing] [Lisa] We're going to meet some of the families that have been affected by drone warfare. I wanna respect them and so I'll stay back, because... I can't imagine how they'd feel seeing somebody that worked on the system that killed their child, or killed members of their family or took limbs. So, I'll stay back, and Asma will be there and talk to them. [speaking in foreign language] Where did Suhrab lose his leg? In the same incident in which his father died. That's when he was injured, before his father could get him and the other one out. My other son Morteza was killed. My husband had him on his chest and was trying to get him and my daughter out of the car, when they were hit. What was the name of the little one, who was killed? Morteza. How old was he? Four years old. Who else was killed? Sima. She was my daughter. Seven years old. Parents see no difference, but my daughter was very beautiful. I loved her. God took her from us. My son was also a good boy. [helicopter whirring] I loved him as well. Oh God! May God bring peace to the country! Our reason for traveling such a long way, is that the world community can hear our voice, and will learn about our helpless situation. So they can see now how this brutal attack has destroyed families, and has wounded, maimed and killed them. That's why we are here. I was a student and wanted to continue my education to become a doctor. I wanted to do something positive for the future of my people and society. We were a group of students, some sick people, and travelers who wanted to visit family and friends. [man] Looks like people in the back of the pickup, one two, three... at least five dudes so far. [sensor] That truck would make a beautiful target. [pilot] Yeah. [mc] Screener said at least one child near SUV. [sensor] Bullshit! Where? Send me a fucking still, I don't think they have kids out at this hour. I know they're shady, but come on. [mc] They're reviewing. [pilot] Yeah, review that shit. Why didn't he say possible child, why are they so quick to call fucking kids but not to call a fucking rifle. [sensor] I really doubt that children call, man. I really fucking hate that. [sensor] Picked up a third vehicle on their train. [mc] Guilty by association. [sensor] They're praying. They are praying. Praying? I mean seriously, that's what they do. [mc] They're gonna do something nefarious. [speaking in foreign language] There is a rest area on the way where we stopped to pray. We got out of our cars, men and women. After our prayer, we left. That's when we heard the sound of a plane. But we couldn't see it. There were two black helicopters. And there was also a white plane that made a "bing" sound. It was hovering above us. We often hear that drones. Can see everything by day and by night. That's what pains me. You can see the difference between a needle and an ant, but not people? We were sitting in the pick-up truck, some even on the bed. How can you not identify us? Did you not see that there were travelers, women and children? [mc] Adolescent near the rear of the SUV. [sensor] Well, teenagers can fight. [mc] Pick up a weapon and you're a combatant. It's how that works. [pilot] JAG25 KIRK97 be advised, all pax are finishing up praying and rallying up near all three vehicles at this time. [sensor] Oh sweet target. I'd try to go through the bed, put it right dead center of the bed. [mc] Oh, that'd be perfect. [pilot] And JAG25, our screeners are currently calling 21 MAMs, no females, and two possible children. How copy? [JAG25] Roger. And when we say children, are we talking teenagers or toddlers? [sensor] I would say about twelve. Not toddlers. [sensor] Something more towards adolescents or teens. [JAG25] We'll pass that along to the ground force commander. But like I said, Twelve, 13 years old with a weapon is just as dangerous. [sensor] Oh, we agree. Yeah. [mc] What's the master plan, fellas? [pilot] I don't know, hope we get to shoot the truck with all the dudes in it. [sensor] Yeah. Sensor is in, let the party begin. [pilot] All right, so the plan is, man, we're going to watch this thing go down, the helo's are going to take out as much as they can and when they Winchester, we can play clean up. [sensor] Hey, MC. [mc] Yes? [sensor] Remember: Kill chain! [mc] Will do. [sensor] Roger. [sensor] And, oh... There it goes! [pilot] Our engagement. [sensor] Stand by. [woman speaking in foreign language] We were horrified and panicked. The vehicles stopped and we got out. Then they hit the vehicle behind us. The men said that the women should get out of the car. We thought that they would stop when they see women. But they just continued bombing us. [pilot] They took the first and the last out. They’re going to come back around. [speaking in foreign language] This is the car. When it stopped, my husband tried to get the children out. [sensor] Looks like they're surrendering. They're not running. [safety observer] Dude, this is weird. [sensor] They hit it. You... These guys are just... [pilot] Holy shit! [sensor] I don't know about this. This is weird. [pilot] That lady is carrying a kid, huh? Maybe. [mc] No. [sensor] Uh, yeah. [mc] The baby, I think on the right. Yeah. [pilot] And that is affirm for Kirk97. Since the engagement, we have not been able to PID any weapons. [indistinct chatter] [man speaking in foreign language] Oh, that is my sweet child. Your father wants to die. Is this your son? That is his son. He was killed. Isn't he the brother of Gulam? Yes, that is him. Are there children under the blanket? Is this a child, too? There are two or three. [woman screams] They are all dead. [all crying] That was a woman and her son. [somber music playing] [cock crows] [man] When your body is intact, your mind is different. You are content. But the moment you are wounded, your soul gets damaged. When your leg is torn off and your gait slows, it also burdens your spirit. Sometimes I am so sad that my heart wants to explode. [indistinct chatter in foreign language] See, this is what pisses me off. Where these fucking assholes are like, they're saying in here, "DGS supposedly sees women and children." They're saying the DGS supposedly sees it. We went to school for almost a year, to be able to identify women and children. And this is a daily thing. Where the pilot and SO's, and everybody that at Creech is constantly saying, "No, no, DGS is full of shit. They don't see anything". This happened all the time. And I'd have to literally sit there arguing with these dickheads and have them just be saying shit like this to the people that I can't talk to. Because I don't have access to talk to them. God damn the DGS fucking hated Creech. Because, they were always trying to kill people. They always wanted to be blowing someone up. And all these officers, the Mick, the pilot, all these people, it looks good on their resume if they kill more people. And then, here they're saying everything's supposedly... DGS is supposedly... calling this out. And then they just have an outright lie that DGS didn't call out any women or children prior to this point when... about an hour before that was when they killed all those people, and DGS was saying right before they killed them that they saw children. I know what crews did this mission, and it wasn't at my base. I can safely say that. 'Cause I remember this call sign. But... this wasn't... these crews weren't... This DGS wasn't my DGS, but they're all set up the same, in terms of the people that are working them, and that's just such bullshit. There's this one thing in here where the pilot's typing... "The lady is carrying a kid, huh? Maybe." And then the sensor operator says, "Uh, yeah". If you were to read a DGS transcript, which you'll never be able get your hands on, you would see lingo and jargon specifically designed to make statements short, and make them possible, probable or confirmed. You wouldn't be seeing people saying, "Maybe it's a kid". "Uh, we don't know". "Uh, we think, it's a possible woman." [scoffs] I couldn't talk about this stuff, because it's classified. But now that I have this unclassified thing sitting right in front of me, of these dickheads saying all this shit about us. [sighs] We were the ones who had to really stop them all the fucking time. You shouldn't have to stop your own people from killing civilians. [engine spluttering] [McChrystal] To the great people of Afghanistan, Salaam-Alaikum. I've spoken with President Karzai, and apologized to him. And to the Afghan people. I've instituted a thorough investigation, to prevent this from happening again. We're extremely saddened by this tragic loss of innocent lives. I've made it clear to our forces, that we are here to protect the Afghan people. I pledge to strengthen our efforts to regain your trust, to build a brighter future for all Afghans. Most importantly, I express my deepest, heartfelt condolences to the victims, and to their families. We all share in their grief, and will keep them in our thoughts and prayers. [indistinct chatter in foreign language] [man speaking in foreign] Where I live is very far from here. There are no hospitals that could make leg prostheses. No Red Cross stations. I came to this center to receive a new prosthesis. It will make my life much easier. [indistinct chatter in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] What did they tell you? [woman] You know, there was three buses full of people, from this village, and one of the story was that, the wife lost the husband and her child. And he went outside with the child, and lifted up and showing the child to the helicopters and the drones that this is a really peaceful family caravan going someplace. By the time he turned around, he was hit. They're not stupid, they know exactly what it is. They know it's drones, they know it's helicopters. They told us, drone is... A plane from above and has cameras, and they can watch and look and take information. They thought drone was not for... strike them. [radio in foreign language] Today is Friday, June 2015. It is 12:15 pm. In Khost province in the district of Ali Shir, an area populated by Kuchi nomads, people were gathering for the funeral of a village elder. When the mourners traveled home, a drone belonging to coalition forces bombed two of their cars. Fifteen civilians were killed. [children laughing] [somber music playing] [Jesselyn] Daniel is in the worst of all worlds because the government clearly has an espionage investigation into him, and now, this is a sword of Damocles hanging over his head that he could be indicted any day, or years from now for espionage, because the government suspects that he is a source of information about the drone program that the government doesn't want out there. [Daniel] I've discussed with my lawyers to the full extent, everything that I think that this investigation could be about. Lot of that is details that I simply could never talk about on film. But what I will say is that it's likely to do with the fact that I'm someone who has both worked for the intelligence community and who is politically active, and therefore, they are suspicious of my... of my background. [indistinct chatter] When did you move here, September? August. Yeah. Probably remember back in like, August, I called you out of nowhere -and asking you about about -Yeah. So, it's a long story to that. I'm okay...but it's a bit of a legal matter. I just want to thank you again for being available. That's really very like... if I couldn't get a hold of you I didn't know what I was going to do. Yeah, any time. Yeah, thanks. But it only got resolved? It's in the middle of being resolved. Hopefully. But, as far as now is concerned, I can't talk about it. Right now my biggest concern is, uh... it's certainly not school. Even though I'm in school. And it's basically like the least thing I'm least focused on, even though it should be the number one priority right now. But right now, I'm just constantly... going over my head and constantly... thinking about what I'm saying. And whom I'm saying it to. And making sure that I'm not saying anything to somebody, whether a stranger or somebody I know, someone I think I can trust or I know I can't trust. I'm always afraid of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. And I'm always second guessing my words everywhere I go. I mean, personally I just live everyday trying to... become more and more comfortable with the idea that it's probably gonna happen, that I'm probably gonna get indicted, and I'm probably gonna get charged, with a crime and that, there's probably a real chance I'll have to fight to stay out of prison. I think it's kind of funny, a little ironic too, because, uh... so far I'm probably the... only adult male in my entire family, immediate and external, that has not been to prison so far. So... I come from a long lineage of prisoners, actually. Great proud tradition of fuck ups who get drunk and go driving or sell pot or, you know, carrying a gun when they shouldn't be carrying a gun. In the wrong place at the wrong time. Lot of that. We're from... But, I've... I don't know. That is it scary, to think about when they meet in prison. I don't have a good answer for that. Is it scary in prison? Yes, that's it. [laughs] That's a friggin' three minute yes. [indistinct TV chatter] [Jesselyn] All the clients I've represented, although I've represented them pro-bono, we have to involve criminal defense attorneys and all of them owe legal bills upwards of a million dollars. And, that usually only goes before trial even began. The million dollar bill, that doesn't even take you through the beginning of trial. So the economic price alone, not to mention the personal price of your relationships, because you can't talk to your friends and family about what's going on. You can't even talk to, theoretically, to a therapist about what's going on. The emotional costs are indescribable and it's not an exaggeration to say that most of my clients who've been under espionage criminal investigations, it's not at all unusual for them to end up, blacklisted and bankrupt and broken. At a minimum, almost every one of my clients who had to deal with this has suffered from severe anxiety, and depression, and suicidal ideation. And in terms of what it could actually do to him, it could imprison him for decades. It's kind of, it's a big day but, it's also good because, like, tomorrow I can wake up and not think, "I wonder what I'll hear from the VA." Whatever they decide, at least I know I don't have to worry about it anymore. [GPS system] Turn right onto the I-5 ramp, then merge onto I-5 South. I'm sure they won't even know what my job was in the military. That's gonna be interesting. If it's a civilian company they're outsourcing to. So, they'll be like, "Wait, what?" "What's a Predator? What's a Reaper?" So, that should be interesting and that should probably have a lot to do with if I don’t get my disability. Don't get the disability. We'll see. I can see that they have ample parking. I don't care about the money. It's about... It's about... recognizing that someone can see... terrible things, and still need to talk to someone about it. And still need to... figure out how to heal from that without having to get shot at, or without having to be in the war zone. It's about... understanding that people see traumatic things, and that can affect them just as much as if you're involved in the traumatic things. Because you are directly involved in the drone program whether people think they are or not. But they'll decide that for me. When I went in I was, like, I was expecting the whole thing to be them coming up with reasons why I don't have PTSD. And the guy sat down and he was so nice. [crying] He sat down and he was like, "So, I was looking at your papers "and seems like you saw a lot of really awful things," and he's like, he had me describe some of them and stuff and I started crying, and he gave me tissues and he's just like... "I'm so sorry," he's like, "I'm so sorry you had to see these things." Like, he's like, [sniffles] "You're way too young for that, you know". It's really tough and we're gonna try to get you the best home we can get you. And, like, it was... he was like, "You know it's good that you're coming in here "and I'm really glad you're seeing a therapist regularly." And he's like, "These are all things that can really help you," and he's like, "I see a lot of people with PTSD" and he's like, "I promise", "it's not always gonna be like this "you're gonna eventually have days where, like, it's a lot easier." He's like, "Hopefully, you won't feel as guilty as you do forever." [waves splashing] [Daniel] It's really tough... to describe what that feeling is like. You know, having the image in your head... of, you know, just taking your own life... is like it's... it's not a good feeling, it's not something... people should have to deal with. And, yet... despite... yet we do. Yet we do have those thoughts sometimes. When we are, in our... in our darkest places and we have... a lot to worry about, and the future is uncertain. And, we are... you know, we feel guilty about our past actions or something of that sort. I'm not sure. [somber music playing] [indistinct TV chatter] [woman on TV] A federal jury in Virginia has convicted former CIA officer, Jeffery Sterling, of nine felony counts including espionage. Prosecutors accused Sterling of leaking classified information to journalist James Ryes of the New York Times. Supporters of Sterling described him as a whistle-blower, but prosecutors claimed he leaked the information to the settle a score with the agency. Sterling's scheduled to be sentenced in April. He faces a maximum possible sentence of decades in prison. [somber music continues] [door closes] [man speaking in foreign language] They apologized many times and then they repeated it. They committed the same atrocities again. They have bombed innocent fellow Afghans at weddings and other occasions. They didn't keep their promise. All we ask is that these attacks don’t happen again. Many Afghans have already been maimed or killed. It shouldn't happen anymore. This is all I want. [indistinct chatter in foreign language] Even though I was crippled and disabled, I still don't feel worthless or unable to feed my children. I don't think of myself as a person without hope. Because if I feel hopeless, my children will also lose hope. This is my wish for our foreign brothers: These things have happened. I lost my limb. Those who were killed, may they rest in peace. But in the future, please do not commit such horrible acts on our Afghan people. It is unbearable. I was told that they forgave me for the part I played in what happened to them. And... that's amazing. And when you think about that these people are considered, you know, of military age, terrorists, all of that... [gulps] you can see people's hearts. I just want people to know that not everybody is a freaking terrorist, and we need to just get out of that mindset. And we need to see these people as people, families, communities, brothers, mothers, and sisters, because that's who they are. Imagine if this was happening to us. Imagine if our children were walking outside of their door, and it was a sunny day, and they were afraid because they didn't know if today was they day that something was gonna fall out of the sky and kill someone close to them. How would we feel? [somber music playing] [Daniel] I think as any activist would be, I am primarily optimistic about the world, you know, for all the cynicism and pessimism that comes out of me. I think that when it really comes down to it, you just have... you have a love for humanity, a love for human beings and one another, that you believe that there is the possibility of change. And that another world is possible, as they say. [Heather] If I see an article about the drone program or something, and see how people talk about cold hearted killers, things like that. That was me. Like, that was my job. Of course, it still is me. That's... You are your history. But, um... if you have any conscious at all, you know that what you did was wrong, and you know that for the rest of your life, it's gonna be there. You can't undo what you did, and you can't bring those people back. So, it's something that you live with. [somber music continues] [Lisa] We are in the United States of America, and we are participating in an overseas war. A war overseas, and we have no connection to it, other than wires and keyboards. Now if that doesn't scare the crap out of you, it does out of me. Because if that's the only connection, why stop?
