Fine Toys - Made In U.S.A A portrait and a program which can be found in the catalogues of the so-called competitor with the nice name Aurora, beautifully phrased along the same lines. Our approach is meant to likewise do them justice. The models that go into production have been carefully selected, with the intent to establish educative values, as well as furthermore matching manual labour with mental labour. We attempt to shape a progressive way of thinking, irrespective of the particular model, in order to provide the model builder with a realistic atmosphere. PAUL W. LINDBERG Golden words from the pen of a U.S. monopoly entrepeneur which baffle us, because we're used to these gentlemen advocating their class interests with less gentle approaches. Well, we'll see. By the way, the catalogues and models depicted here are being distributed by a company from Munich. Now then, the exquisite vintage car has been taken note of by us, as a prelude and as in stock. And this Ferrari Berlinetta also solely ratifies the solid quality of the advertised products, if we want to disregard the tendency that the handicraft enthusiast gets offered a striking number of vehicles whose originals can usually only be bought by owners of huge equity stakes. But perhaps it's regarded as a kind of humanitarian compensatory satisfaction for the common man. And thus we want to accept it. But when it comes to the next model, one can have reasonable doubts if the creation of models of greatest accuracy in simple assembly sets is actually the exclusive goal that the producers pursue. Because that is not just any tank. That is, undeniably true to the original, the Tiger Tank of the Fascist armed forces, along with some... soldiers that are true to the original. Let us be clear, we're showing you the offer of contemporary American toy companies. And this offer also includes, so that nothing with regard to the glory of German heroes serving imperialism may be forgotten about, Baron Manfred von Richthofen's Fokker from the First World War. If one were to believe the legends, this gentleman engaged in warfare in a similar manner to the virtous hunt. The fact that no rabbits or deer were killed, but Englishmen and Frenchmen, doesn't bother the producers of this toy. Because they want to equally profit from toys and war. They got a new production line. Mr. Lindbergs calls it the only right one. The American line. They offer: The true to the original models of the most important aircraft types of the Fascist armed forces. The aircaft types which turned Warsaw, Rotterdam and Coventry into debris and ash. And which were also lethal for thousands of Americans. Appealing models for everyone. A must-have for any handicraft enthusiast. Part of that must-have is obviously this incarnation of the Fascist war machinery. the nightmare of nations that have been barbarically assaulted, from Spain to the Soviet Union. Stuka Ju 87, with a discharge flap that folds out, as a present for Peter in Munich and Jimmy in New York. And all that today, almost 25 years after the verdicts against the war crimes of the Fascists during the Nuremberg Trials. There's no way of denying it, this line is a very consistent line. It is being put about by these fine toy manufacturers, with half wild and thrilling markets and million sales. The super fortress B-29 can release in the playrooms as it did back then in Dresden. And in order to closely pass the educational values on to the buyer, the town that shall be destroyed is also being delivered. And like that the catalogues consequently continue. None of the murderous machines that became infamous above Korea, Vietnam or the United Arabic Republic is missing. And that's how the catalogue displays the pilots. Here they don't yet wear a pajama though. With their Jaguar they drive to the Thunderchief or to the atomic plane Hustler B-52 in order to pursue their destructive jobs. That's target-oriented playing, because what Little Hans learns, Hans will later be able to apply easily. That's why on every birthday, on every Christmas, in sum: on every occasion, in Munich and in New York, fine toys, made in U.S.A. It should therefore be obvious whose line is being pursued. But some considerations regarding the methologies of the potential war criminals seem unavoidable. Within all sections it begins rather harmlessly. "Oh Little Dove", "Life at Sea is Dangerous", etc. After that the collector's desire gets directed toward complete series, and soon they go afloat: the war ships of the Nazis, admiral Count Spee, battleship Bismarck U 505. And their contemporary big brother, the atomic aircraft carrier Forester, one of the mightiest war machines of the U.S. marine. Death, molded in steel and iron, advertised in the catalogue as dashing, breathtaking and dramatic. And many other ships belonging to the arsenal of the U.S. battle fleet, which the Pentagon wants to use in order to complete on a large scale what the the Nazis failed to accomplish: the gagging and supression of any form of progress in the world. What did Lindberg say in his programmatic statement? Irrespective of the particular model, we attempt to shape a progressive way of thinking. Indeed, that's just what we had in mind. And we must at least thank Mr. Lindberg for defining such accurately what an American businessman in the freest country of the free world means by progress. With regard to the other offers in the catalogue though, no sarcasm or irony would be appropiate. Here the aim is nothing but the deformation of the human image, a planned and shamelessly revealing dehumanization, starting in the playroom. Satan's crate. His goal is destruction. He's wild and foolish. It's a delight to build him according to Lindberg's easy to understand manual. Big Wheeler. A terrifying character with cold, colourful, bloodshot eyes and a welcoming grin. Scuttlebucket, the shattered nightmare with the charcoal pannier. He will shovel himself right into your collection. And you will be proud to own him. These are original quotes from the same catalogue with the backpage on which Mr. Lindberg proclaims his already quoted program. Can it be any worse? It can be. Because apparantly the dirtiest fantasies are being made concrete and thus usable for the children of the Western world. Aurora offers: the Nutty Nose Nipper Machine, an easily movable instrument which immediately transforms any playroom into a torture chamber, guaranteeing the awakening of the most primitive instincts. In that fashion even the toy industry has to contribute to the suggestion of brutal role models. Movie Monsters. Spawns of perverted sadists' brains. Known from thousands of Western films, television and comic publications. Now likewise available as a model for the playroom and the display case. That's catalogue No. 421: the tortured hunchback of Notre-Dame. The bloody mummy. The catalogue of Aurora kindly says: One can paint it in a fancy way and have lots of fun with it. And we apologize to you for this ending. It's the first time you get to see something like this in a film produced in the German Democratic Republic. We show it to you because this toy is also being sold in every decent toy shop in West Germany, and because we have to be alert to the consequences of this systematic poisoning of human thinking and feeling. The enemies of mankind use all available means. Fine Toys - Made in U.S.A.
