You're here for Sarah? Sarah Hayes. Excuse me. Long day, huh? Yeah, been up since 5:00 this morning. That is a long day. Well, if you wanna close your eyes and grab some sleep, I promise not to be offended. Thanks. But I think it's getting to that point in the night where it's almost better to stay up than to sleep a few hours and wake up all groggy. Another early day tomorrow? Unfortunately. So if I may, what keeps an early riser out late on a work night? Everlasting bond of friendship. Sounds like there's a story there. Hmm, nothing too dramatic really. My friend picked me up. We went out together and she just got too drunk. So I ended up having to drive her home. Nice of you to look after your friend like that. It's not easy finding someone trustworthy in this day and age. You guys are friends from work I assume? Yeah. How did you know? Just a hunch. There's a bar pretty close to here that hosts a lot of workplace events, Figured you came from there. Funny, yeah, that's exactly where we came from. I guess in a job like this, you must run into a lot of people with familiar stories, right? In a way. But everyone's unique. So, the story's never quite the same. I'll just be a minute. Sure. Hello? Hello, Daren? Is it you? Hey, hey, can you hear me? Hello? Sarah! Sarah! I'll be right back! Hello? Hello? Oh, I... I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, it's me. Where did you go? I tried calling but I kept losing service. I was looking for you. Where were you? I had to find an ATM. The credit card reader on the pump is broken and I only had enough for $20 worth. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. I'm glad I found you. It's a pretty bad neighborhood. It's not good to run off like that. Hey, can we just... Of course, I'm sorry, I... didn't mean to breach. You feeling any better? Yeah. Yeah. I just got a little shaken up. That's all. Hey, I'm, I'm sorry if I snapped at you. Water under the bridge. You all right? Yeah. I'm more embarrassed than anything. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone gets spooked now and then. Still... Don't give it another thought. Anyone would've reacted the same. Well, I just feel, kind of, stupid. There was nothing really to be afraid of. Don't be so hard on yourself. Look, that place was unfamiliar. And the unfamiliar frightens people. I don't know. I guess what bothers me is... I don't wanna be one of those people who's suspicious of everything or everyone outside their comfort zone. I hear you. Suspicion can be a nasty habit. Especially the way things are going these days. But still, you never know what's going to happen and it's good to be prepared. Not sure if I see the difference. Well, you carry pepper spray, a Taser, anything like that? Yeah. Actually, I got pepper spray in my bag. I don't imagine you ever believe you'll actually use it? Hmm, not really, no. But you're prepared for your worst case scenario should you need it, right? Right. It's the sensible thing to do. You hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Unfortunately, most people convince themselves they're prepared but they rarely are. What do you mean? That pepper spray is your nuclear option. You know your last line of defense, right? Uh-hmm. Right. What if I told you that when you needed it most, it probably won't work? Why wouldn't it work? May I? Yeah, sure. Yeah, see that? It's inert. These things are only usually good for a couple of years, so after that the aerosol component loses pressure. Oh, great. So it's useless. Not necessarily. You might be able to trick someone into believing that it still works but I wouldn't stake my life on it. See these numbers here on the side? Yeah. See what it says? Seems it expired two years ago. Exactly. You know it's crucial that when you abide... Watch out! I didn't see him. I was distracted. He came out of nowhere. You saw it. I didn't mean to. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It was an accident. I... No, no, no, no, no, this can't be happening. I mean, what was he doing at the side of the road? Maybe he's just hurt. No, no, no, no, he has no pulse, Sarah. - He's gone. - No, no, no, no, no. We have to get out of here. Sarah, we have to get out of here now. What? No, no, no, no. We have to call the police or something. You're right. You're right. We'll do it from the car but we just can't stay here. What are you talking about? We... we can't leave him here. We have to. If we're here when the police show up, they're gonna arrest us. No, no, it was... It was an accident. - We... - Do you think that matters? It's not like we were jaywalking here. A man is dead. If they catch us... we're looking at pretty serious jail time. Look, I... I can't just leave him lying here - in the street like that. - No, no, no, no. You have to, for your own sake. I mean, we're both liable here. When we were driving, I was distracted. I was talking to you and I didn't see him coming. That makes you an accessory. No, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean to distract you. I know. I know. And I'm not blaming you, but that doesn't change the fact that we're in this together. Look, he's gone, Sarah... and there's nothing we can do to change that. If we stay, we are only gonna make it worse for ourselves. Please, trust me. Staying here would be the biggest mistake of your life. Hey, did you just get home? Hello? You there? I'm here. How was the rest of the night? Sarah? Can you come and pick me up? You all right? Please. Uh, okay. Um, yeah, no, I'll... I'll leave here right now. - Where are you? - Downtown. Did you see any cross streets nearby? I don't know. I'm in a carwash somewhere around 5th Street. That's all right. I'll find you. Just hang tight. I'll be there in 30 minutes? No, no, no, no. I need you now. Okay. Can you tell me what's going on? I can't talk about it on the phone. Do you need me to call the police? No, no, don't. Um... hey, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I just needed to hear your voice, the car wash is closing and I... I didn't wanna wait outside alone. I can be down there in no time. Never mind. I'm... I'm... I'm fine. I... it's late and I just got a little scared. That's all. You sure? You sound pretty upset. Yeah, it's nothing. I promise. Okay. Well, um, look, if you need anything, even if you just get scared, give me a call, okay? I will. Thank you. Okay. No, no, no. Look out! Jesus Christ! Hit the gas! Hit the gas! Don't look! Hold on! He's gaining on us. No, no, no, no, hold on! Might wanna take it easy. You may have a concussion. You should drink something. It may help. Suit yourself. I... I swear I wasn't gonna say anything. I just needed some space. I... I was overwhelmed, I... I was in shock. I didn't call the police or anything, you can check my phone if you want. Something that I said? Please. I just wanna go home. You have my word, I won't say anything. It's okay. You don't have to lie to me. But I'm not. I... I'm not, you can trust me. I won't tell anyone what happened. Is that what you think I want to hear? Let... let's talk about this. Let's figure something out. Get out. Please, you don't have to do this. Please. Please. Start the car. Yeah. Keep heading straight for another mile, and then take a right up to 8th Road. You should probably keep your eyes on the road. Wouldn't want another accident now, would we? Can you please tell me where we're going? Maybe if I knew, I could drive more safely. That's it there, fourth building on the right. Just do as you're told and everything will be fine. Oh, uh, hey, you're here for Noah? We sure are. Huh, uh, I must've ordered carpool by mistake. Don't worry, you... you didn't. I'm just mentoring my friend, Sarah here. Oh, uh, okay. That's cool. Ooh, it's like an oven in here. Yeah, sorry about that. The radiator's broken, so we have to have the heat on to stop the car from overheating. You mind if I crack open a window? Actually, I'd prefer it if you didn't. The wind noise makes it hard for Sarah and I to communicate. It's funny, I... I've never heard of anyone doing a ridesharing apprenticeship before. It's that like a new thing or... Not really. I've done quite a few now. Well, you know how it is. Late at night, young woman on the road, it can be dangerous. You never know who's gonna get into your car. Oh, yeah. For sure. So, what has you venturing out so late tonight? Uh, I just got switched to the night shift over at the Fresh Top Market on Elm. But I'm not looking to turn that into a career or anything, I'm just gonna stay there until I get out of college. Oh, you hear that, Sarah? We've got a scholar on our midst. Uh, between work, school, it sounds like you got a pretty hectic schedule. You leave any time for socializing? Have a girlfriend maybe? Uh, me and my friends hang out when we can, uh, haven't had too much time for girls lately though because of my new hours and all. You know, Sarah has this friend, a bit of a night owl but she might just be your type. Oh, uh, that's okay. I don't... Sarah, would you be so kind as to pass me your phone? No, really, I'm... I'm not looking for... Now, now, don't be so shy. It's not like you have to marry her or anything. Just take a quick look, you never know when Cupid's arrow might strike. Sarah, your phone? It's just there on the dashboard. Ah, your phone's locked. What's your passcode again? 7586. That's right. You see, this is her friend that I was telling you about. What was her name again? Kelly. That's right, Kelly. See how pretty she is? Yeah. She's very beautiful. Looks like we're nearly here. Sarah, be a dear, please, and park him up on the right there. Whoa, whoa, that was it. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah. Uh, I'm... I'm, I'm so sorry. Uh, that's all right. I can turn around and bring him back. Uh, it's fine... I can just walk the rest of the way. She should bring you back. You don't want to be rude. Uh, it's fine, really. Nonsense. I insist. Um, by the time we turn around and head back, I'd be there already. You sure? I feel like we're inconveniencing you. Oh, seriously, it's not a big deal. I'm very sorry. I guess she's just not ready for this level of responsibility just yet. Uh, don't worry about it. I thought you did great. Can we at least offer you a bottle of water to make up for everything? It might make you feel better. Sure. All right. I'd love a water, actually. The center armrest, Sarah. Awesome, thanks. Excuse me. Everything okay? Yeah, it went down the wrong pipe, I think. Thank you. I know that must've been difficult for you. Is there anything you'd like to say before we go? Come on, come on. Emergency roadside assistance. What seems to be the trouble? - Hi there. - Help! I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hit the, uh, emergency roadside button as I was readjusting my rearview mirror. Not a problem, sir. We just need a verbal confirmation that everything's okay inside the vehicle. Everything's fine. Thank you. I'm noticing here that we seem to be having some trouble locating your GPS data. Hmm. That's odd. But I recently did some work on the vehicle myself. I think it's possible that I may have damaged a fuse, or a sensor, or something. It's quite possible if that's the case. If you guys continue to use this feature, you'll need to take the vehicle and to have it serviced at a certified maintenance center. All right. Well, that's a bit disconcerting but I'll be sure to get it looked at the next time we take the vehicle in. Sorry for the inconvenience. Not a problem, sir. Have a good evening. You as well. You know, this isn't what I had intended for us, but you forced my hand. Relax. Relax. What are we doing here? We always hurt the ones we love, didn't we? No. No. Please. Please. You need this, Sarah. It's for your own good. Please. Please. Don't do this. I wish I could help, Sarah. I really do. But you left me no alternatives. You, you do have a choice. You don't have to do this. If I indulge you now, what will that teach you? Spare the rod, spoil the child. You're right. You're right. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I won't try to speak again. I promise. Just leave her out of this, please. I want to believe that but my trust can't be given. It needs to be earned. You're right. You're right. It's my fault. But just give me one more chance, please. That's what I'm trying to do, Sarah. Where are you going? No. No! No! No. Wait. Wait. No! Kelly! Kelly! Kelly! No! No! Kelly! Kelly! Kelly. Kelly. Kelly! Kelly. Kelly! Kelly! No. No. Kelly. No. No. Kelly. Kelly. Wouldn't do that if I were you. How is everything? Excellent. Thank you. You sure I can't get you anything to eat? You should really have something. Help keep your strength up. You'll have to excuse her. She just lost a very close friend. Oh. I'm so sorry. You take all the time you need, dear. Is there anything else I can get you in the meantime? Some of hot tea maybe? That will be lovely. And a cup of coffee for me too please. You seem upset. You want to talk about it? You know, it's not healthy to keep these things bottled up inside, Sarah. Suit yourself. But you should know that I'm not the only one that's worried about you. Your friend, Matt, also seems very concerned. He's been texting you all night, trying to see if you made it home okay. You should put his mind at ease and let him know you're all right. Unless of course you want me to reply for you. If you're not feeling up to it, that is. Thank you. "Home safely." It's not exactly poetry, but it'll do. This is dispatch for Unit 19, please respond. This is Unit 19. Go ahead. We just received a report of a possible domestic abuse situation at the Sunrise Diner. Copy that. Unit 19 responding. Dispatch, this is Unit 19. Over. Go ahead, 19. What's the information on a black SUV. License plate number 7, x-ray, John, boy, 938. Stand by. Earlier tonight, we received a report from roadside assistance for the vehicle in question citing an accidental engagement of the emergency call switch. Anywhere you'd like, officer. A cup of coffee when you get a chance. Excuse me. Sorry to bother you folks. Is that your vehicle out there in the parking lot? Why, yes, it is, officer. Do you realize you have a cracked headlight? Uh, yes. I've been meaning to get that fixed. Since you're parked, it's not really a ticketable offense per se, but you really should get that taken care of before it becomes a problem down the road. Oh. Okay. I'll be sure to get it sorted the first chance I get. - Thank you, officer. - My pleasure. Say, that's a pretty serious bruise you got there. Mind if I ask what happened? Oh, that? It's nothing really. You know, I've got a first aid kit in my car. I could help you clean it up a little if you like, make sure it doesn't get infected. That's very kind of you but it really won't be necessary. It looks a lot worse than it is. You sure? It's really no trouble. She's sure. Does he always answer like this for you? There's nothing to be afraid of. I just wanna make sure you're all right. Don't take it personally. We're very private people. I'm sorry if I upset you. I meant no offense. But if you feel comfortable, maybe we could talk for a minute in private. Why, officer, if I didn't know better, I'd say you're trying to steal my girl. - Excuse me? - No, he didn't mean it. I just wanna ask her a couple of questions. Well, ask away. I'm sure she won't mind if I stay. But I do. Well, that could be a problem. You see, we don't do terribly well when we're apart from one another. Call it separation anxiety. Call it whatever you like but I still need to speak to her directly. Now, if you don't mind... It doesn't seem like he's leaving me much choice. Please don't. It's okay, ma'am. You don't need to be afraid of him. No. You don't understand. I understand that we received a distress call from within his vehicle and you're showing clear signs of physical abuse. Doesn't seem like he quite has the full picture, does it? Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to restrain yourself. Just leave us alone. I, I don't want your help. You don't have to be intimidated by him. Sounds like she'd like you to leave. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step outside of the booth now. He has a gun! Unit 19, what's your status, over? I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever wake up. Dreaming of a better tomorrow no doubt. Let me out of here. Let me out of here! Don't worry. Everything will all be over soon. I'm sorry it had to be like this, Sarah. I wish we could have spent more time together, but unfortunately nothing lasts forever, and even the best things must come to an end. Before we part ways, you really should know that even though it might seem otherwise, I really do hold you in the highest regard. You're a fighter like me. But even the best fighters, lose now and then. I've never been very good at saying goodbye... so instead let me just say... see you on the other side. Rad 11, go. Stop the vehicle. This is the police. Stop the vehicle now or we will be compelled to use force. Stop the vehicle now. This is your final warning. Open fire! Your parents are just leaving right now. They should be down in a few hours. It's just the wind. Want me to check it out? Okay. We should take this down tonight, okay? Get inside. What? Get back inside. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. There's nothing out there. No. That was hers. That was Kelly's bracelet. - He took it. - Sarah. Sarah, he's gone, okay? He can't hurt you anymore. No. He's here. He's here. We have to call the police. It's okay. It's okay. Oh... Matt. I'm calling the cops. My phone is gone. We need to get out of here. No. Wait, wait, wait. Please. Don't. No. You, you don't know what he's like. We can do this, all right? You just follow my lead. Why are you doing this? The more you resist, the worse it gets. All your friends are gone, Sarah. There's nothing left for you out there. Stop trying to fight this and just let go. Disappointing. I had much higher hopes for you, Sarah. I'd like to thank everyone who came out here today, and especially those of you who were... brave enough to share your stories with the rest of us. As victims of abuse, we, we have to live every day with the memories of our tormentors. They scar us deeply, corrupting our ability to interact with everyday people and places. But we cannot allow our feelings to overwhelm us, 'cause fear and its ability to distort our perception is their most powerful weapon. I know... I know the path towards recovery is not an easy one, but take heart knowing you don't have to do it alone. Your family, your friends, your... This community we have right here, they are willing to give us any support we need. So we have the power to take back our lives and move forward... together.
