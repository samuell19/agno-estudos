You all look great, mama. I thought some of my friends would be there to meet me at the station. They probably thought we'd like some time alone. I know, mama, but Peewee should have been there.

I had a few, but I shouldn't talk about it. Go ahead. We all family here. Well, sir, I wanted to be a champion race car driver. That's the craziest one I ever heard, all right. You didn't think you'd race with them white boys? Yes, sir. It all depended. Depended on when hell freezes over. Ha ha ha ha. A race car driver. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

So far we have impounded one '47 Buick with no licence or registration, and 13 cases of illegal whiskey. We have yet to find out where he hides his cars. Nor have we been able to apprehend this nigra. I'm not just talking about moonshine, gentlemen, no, sir. I am talking about the course that your bumbling police work has cost the city. Not to mention the nine patrol cars that were completely demolished in the process. The Mayor is rightfully upset. The treasury department is upset. I'm upset. Been made to look foolish and incompetent while this nigra is running around loose. Well, maybe I haven't made myself clear in the past. I want his black ass in jail.

I hear you caught that nigger, Wendell Scott. Yeah. Finally got him. Almost got himself killed out there today. Too bad he didn't. Cotton, can he drive? Can he drive? Can he drive? Shit. He drove me crazy. Sheriff, I have got a little proposition for you. I want to put that boy on my track. What? Wait just a minute. Hear me out. What are you talking about? I'm talking about filling up my stands. I'm talking about making money. I'm talking about putting that boy out, so the white folks will come to see him get killed, and the niggers... Well, hell, they'll just come out. Do you know how long it's taken me to catch that boy? What good is he doing you in jail? I'm talking about money. Let's get that boy out of jail and make some money off his black ass. I don't know. Huh? Wendell Scott? Yeah. Who are you? Billy Joe Byrnes. I own the local race track. I just made a deal for you. What kind of deal? You race for me on my track, and I'll get 12 of the 15 counts dropped against you. You'll get probation and a small fine. Course, you know, you've got to cross the finish line. Otherwise, you could pull between 10 and 12 years of hard time. Why are you doing this for me? Well, it ain't because I like you. You're going to put money in my pocket. We'll get people out to the track. Let me tell you something, that crowd loves the smell of blood. I don't know nothing about no racing. Ah, hell, you don't have to know anything. Just get a car. I'll give you gasoline money and a set of tyres. I don't know. Look, you can be out of this jail in 30 minutes. Now you fish or cut bait, boy. I ain't got much a choice, huh? That's right. Then I guess it's a deal. I went looking for Slack, but they put him on the bus to Richmond. I don't care about that. Slack's in trouble. He couldn't do nothing but what he did. I had a bondsman. You didn't have to get yourself messed up in this crazy deal. That ain't no crazy deal, Peewee. I want to race. You call that racing, Wendell? You're just black bait. They're going to try to kill you. Quiet down. Mary don't know. It's dangerous out there. I know it is. Don't... You got paint all over the floor. It's all right. We can clean it up. You mean I'm going to clean it up. It doesn't matter, does it? Here. 34... Well, you know, hauling liquor's one thing, racing cars is another. That's right. I've got to see this.

Run him in the ground. As far as I'm concerned, you're all niggers. - Hey. - Hey. I was just wondering... Is that a picture of you? Is that your face? Oh, I'm sorry, I've got it upside-down. I just thought it was a good likeness of your face, right in through... No? Then you might like it as a souvenir. Thank you. Hey, George, look at that nigger. He ain't going to make it four laps. They'll put him in the trees. See Beau Welles down there? He'll take care of that nigger. You'd better get that car ready. You're holding this race up. Boy, when they wave the green flag, you take off. It's 25 laps. One time around is a lap. One time around, that's a lap. Anything goes wrong with your car, you pull it into the pits. Pull into the pits if something wrong. That's the pits, right, Captain? Yellow flag means caution. You slow down. Yellow flag, caution. I slow down. Put on the brakes. That's it. Black flag means get the hell off the track. Get the hell off the track on the black flag. A white flag means you got one lap left. One lap left to do on the white flag. That's it. You understand? I believe so, sir. Tell me about the chequered flag. I wouldn't worry about that chequered flag if I was you, boy. All right, drivers, start them engines. Go. Just hold up, baby. Just hold up. What a fine race coming up today, folks, starting with a 10-lap sprint. We've got a first here today. We've got a coloured boy in car number 34, name of Wendell Scott. Keep your eye on that boy.

He made it out, gents. 34, Wendell Scott. They're getting in a-knocking and a-banging. We got a game, folks, he might make it. How about that nigger? On the number two turn, they're coming through to number three... Hey, nigger, don't wreck. Come on, Wendell. Hang on, Wendell. Look out, nigger. 30, Beau Welles and Willy Hutch, they're trying to block number 34. Wa-hoo. Peewee, go down there and do something. That coloured boy's hanging in there, but he's got five more laps to go, folks. Why don't you suckers just leave him alone? Ok, meat-Fink, let's race. Almost got me a nigger. Go. Go. Go. G... They're blocking number 34 again. He's trying to get through. Get the hell out of my way. Now go with them. Go to the right. Oh. Bye, nigger. I think we need a wrecker. He's gone over the fence. How about that? I told you old Beau would fix him up. Look at him over by that fence over there. Look at him. Where? Where? There he comes, number four turn. You all ought to seen him. Look at that nigger. Come on, baby, come on. Whoo, Wendell. He's still smoking in the fifth turn. He's trying to make it. Can he make it? - Go. Go. Go. - Go. Go. Go. Come on, baby. Don't stop. Don't. - Go. Go. - Go. Go. Ya-hoo. I made it. I knew it. Did you see? I finished. What are you doing? Fixing breakfast. Why are you working on this car instead of the taxi? You're not going to moonshine again, are you, Wendell? No. I'm racing. Racing? That's right, Mary. It cost us a lot of money to fix this car up, damn near 2 jobs. I figure we ought to get our money's worth out of it. It doesn't matter what it cost, Wendell. What matters is you're free. Not if I ain't doing what I want to do. I've wanted to be a race car driver all my life. Are you crazy? Didn't you learn anything on that track yesterday? I damn sure did. They can't kill me, even if they try. There ain't no better driver than I am. I finished in this car, and I can win, Mary. Next time I'll win. They're going to kill you, Wendell, and that's the truth. The truth is, Mary, I'm tired of lying to you, and I'm tired of lying to myself. I'm going to be a race car driver. What you looking for, Wendell? Some of this, some of that. Some of everything.

Well, man, my name is Woodrow. Yeah, well, pleased to meet you, Woodrow. Save that arm. This is my friend Peewee. I'm Mr. Scott's spiritual advisor. Let me tell you something, Mr. Scott. I'd sure like to work for you. I'm a good motor and electrical man. I can't afford no mechanic. Sorry. Hey, I got weekends, you know, and I'd sure like to see you keep running, maybe even win one. You think I can do it? I sure think you can if I'm working with you. Well, Woodrow, welcome aboard. Now we got a team, Wendell. What in the hell is that? Damn. Coons trying to come in here. How you do? When do I put my car on the track? I'd say never. What? What's your name, boy? I'm Scott. I entered last week. My pit pass. Couldn't tell from your entry form you're coloured. Can't let you race against these white folks. I'll give you your money back. I don't want no damn money. I want to race. I got to give you your money back. Look at that crowd of niggers. So it won't be for nothing, I got a boy who can really drive. Get one to drive your car. Mister, I built this car. Damn if I'm gonna let somebody else drive it. They ain't going to never let you run. They ain't going to never let you race. Every place I go, they're going to try to lock me out. That's what they going to do, see? Because they own everything.

Roberts over the track. ♪ Yes, I took Jesus for my saviour ♪ Well, we have no report yet on Roberts. Now the white flag is flying. Beau's got it. Looks like Beau Welles has himself another win with G.P. Johnson second, Arthur James third, and Wendell Scott takes a shortcut to fourth position. See what you get for fourth place. Ain't that something? Would've had first place, except for Beau Welles. Hell with Beau Welles. I got some plans for his ass. We're on our way, Woodrow. Free steak dinner. I know you're hungry. I ain't that hungry. I don't like to eat standing up and I don't like to eat in nobody's kitchen. I got my own food. Take the car home. I'm enjoying myself tonight. Hey, you want to get your hands off that? Think you're hot shit, don't you? Yeah. What'd you get, fourth? What'd you get? I got a busted radiator, ass face. Peckerhead, I got two tickets to the Colonial restaurant for dinner. They don't serve no boogies there. They're going to serve this boogie. Is that right? That's right. If you plan on getting anything to eat, better take me along. For what? I can handle my own trouble. Trouble? Shit, we'll eat that first. What you going to pull? I'll probably pull a 5.14. 5.14 kind of light for that track. Try to run any hotter, you'll blow an engine. Go right ahead, honey. Beau Welles blew himself up in Charlotte three weeks ago. What are you going to pull? I was thinking about pulling a 5.38. I'm sorry. You'll have to come back some other time to fix the ice box. I'm not fixing no ice box. We're here to eat. There must be some mistake. This the Colonial restaurant? Yes. You are from the race track. I'm sorry, but my husband is not here today. I mean that we just don't ordinarily... I mean don't ever serve coloured. What about those steaks? It does say free steak dinner. It says two. Wendell, how do you like your steak? It would have to happen... Medium-well. When my husband's not here. He's likes his medium-well. I'd like mine well-done, please. I'll get your dinners for you, but promise to eat very fast. Your waitress will be right here. You from around here? Danville. Danville. I been there. I'm a local boy myself. Born and raised. Spent a little time up in Chicago. You in the service? No. I busted my leg. I couldn't join. How did you bust your leg? You ever do any time? Damn near. I used to run liquor. Are you still moonshining? It's disgraceful letting a nigger eat in here with us. Who in the hell do you think you are? Don't mind that drunk. Don't mind him. It's disgraceful. Kind of hard not to. Pay him no mind. What cam you running? Who the hell are you? Are you deaf? Something stinks around here. I don't know if it's the nigger or you, white trash. You ought to be... Oh. I got your back. Oh, Lord. What's happening? Why don't you sit down, ok? Don't worry, folks. I'll bring the plates back. Sorry to interrupt your eating. Just come to have dinner. Good day. That's the raunchiest steak I ever had. I think that may be dog meat. That's why they gave it to us free. Want some coke to wash it down? No, thank you. It's cool. Well... Hey, you going by the restaurant? Yeah. I'll go by. - Do me a favour. - What's that? I promised that waitress I'd give her plate back. Throw this out as you pass by. Going to be able to make the next race? I think I've got the bottom in. Maybe you just threw a rod. No. I broke my crank. That's it. That's it, you old bastard. I'm done. I'm finished. Best driver on the track, and I've got a turd for a car. Maybe it ain't so bad, man. Is that right? You sure you through? What the hell do you think? Well, you won't be needing this then. That's what I think. What are you doing? Well, don't mind me. Why don't you just go ahead and help yourself? Don't let me interfere. Why don't you take my tyres? You've been wanting my transmission. Take that, too, now. Come on, you vulture. You said you was through. Damn. What the hell's the matter with that? Fuel pump. Let an expert take a look. Well, no wonder. You got a load of dirt in your filter. Woodrow, look. He's got a mound of dirt. I can't watch everything. We could use another mechanic. What's going on here? Some damn son of a bitch sliced my tyres. Inside so they'd blow during the race. Wonderful. I hate to say I told you so, but them damn buggers on the supreme court think they can change the world overnight, they got another thing coming. You're going to have yourself a whole lot of fun out there today. You don't want me to drive? Just help me change the tyres. Yessuh, boss. I's a coming, boss. See you at your funeral. What's wrong, boy? Having tyre trouble? Damn. Hey, coloured boy, I'm talking to you. What you want, Beau? I got two cars in this race. When that green flag drops, I'll drive one right up your ass. That suits me fine. Because you'll be behind. I'll be in front. Boy, there's nothing I hate worse than a smart-aleck nigger. You just watch your mouth. You know, Beau, I'm going out there to win today. I'm crossing that finish line first. Drive your two cars to hell for all I care. Nigger. Yeah? We'll see about that. Let's get that damn thing down. What'd he want? Wishing me luck. Come on, we got a race to win. Hello, again, everybody. Welcome to the Middle Virginia Speedway for the Sunday afternoon 1955 classic race.

Wendell, would you care for something? We got something here. I'll leave you two alone. Thank you, ma'am. Scott, how are you doing? Fine. I, heard you were running in the Virginia championship, so I stopped over to wish you good luck. Thank you, sheriff. Well, I kind of feel like I'm responsible for your racing career. Huh? Yeah, you did, in a way. You're the biggest thing that ever hit Danville. I'm proud of you. Everybody's proud of you. Times sure have changed, huh? You folks getting to vote and everything. You running for Mayor and everything. Apropos, I'd like to ask you a favour. For the campaign, I would like to take a little picture, me and you, and maybe the family? I think Danville should see two of its finest together. What do you say, huh? You was a tough old sheriff, Cotton. Yeah. You can have your picture. Wendell's car, car number 34, has crashed. Wendell? Wendell, it's Mary. The doctor said, you're going to be all right this time. But what about the next time? Honey, please stop. You're 42 years old. You got 15 years on half the men you race against. Honey, they got the sponsors. They got big oil companies and car companies. They got the best cars and the best mechanics. What you got? Wendell, I love you. Here's Beau Welles, winner of the Daytona 500, now getting it together for the major challenge of the year, the 1970 Grand National race to be held at the International Speedway in three weeks. Beau Welles and G.C. Spencer are the two favourites. Unless there's a surprise, the race will be between these two contenders. Yesterday in Memphis, Tennessee, thousands of blacks filled the streets after Tuesday's violent battle with police which caused thousands of dollars in damages. 2 people dead and 20 hospitalised. Army reserves and police were on hand, but the crowd was quiet and orderly. Members of the local NAACP paraded, asking for full recognition of civil rights. You young boys don't know nothing about the civil rights movement. Man, what are you talking about? I know a man so bad that he moulded civil rights. Come on. What are you talking about? Listen here for a minute. Back in 19 and 47, I knew a man so bad that when he was moonshining, he had 10 police cars chasing after him. He blew a tyre. They thought they had the nigger caught. You know what he did? What? He jumped out of the car, ran towards the police car, jumped over their hoods, ran into the fields, and they ain't caught up with him since. Who you talking about, supernigger? You lie, man. If I'm lying, I'm flying. You must be flying. He's alive and kicking, living here in Danville today. Who? Who? Who is he? Wendell Scott. I know the nigger. What's he doing now? I'll tell you what he's doing. Entered the Grand National this morning. He entered the Grand National... You entered the Grand National this morning? Sure did, Peewee. You lying. You got a car? No. You got a crew? No. What you got? Heart. You got a partner. Get Woodrow and tell him the silver bullet team is back in motion again. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Woodrow... What is that? It's Wendell's new race car. His new race car? Woodrow just brought over your new race car. It's here already? I thought you weren't racing no more. I was going to tell you about that, Mary. Oh, you were. I entered the Grand Nationals. Peewee and Woodrow want to help me build a winner. After all you been through? I can't sit around the house the rest of my life doing nothing. You got that garage out there in back. You got plenty to do. I ain't no quitter, Mary. And I don't want people to think I am. Ok. If that's what you want to do. Go on and race in that Grand National. But I'm not gonna be there. I got to race, Mary. I love you, and I need you, but I got to race. I hope you change your mind. Wendell. Wendell. How you doing? I been meaning to call. How you doing? I didn't know you worked here. Oh, yeah. I finally made the big time. Sure have. What do you think? I think it's good. How's your leg? Better than my back. Your kids? Fine. Yours? My oldest looks me in the eye. Hutch, how about that screwdriver? You got it. I'm here to buy a wedge motor. Bill Sullin ain't got one. I heard you're getting ready for the Grand National. That's right. I'm going to win, too. You got Peewee with you? Peewee, Woodrow. Damn near all of Danville's helping me. Yeah, well. Ever get tired of big time, you always got a job with me. Take care of yourself. Good luck. Yeah. Oh. Goddamn, buddy. I thought we killed you. Got metal in my leg where there used to be bone. Other than that, I'm fine. Thinking about racing again, huh? That's all I know. Why push yourself like that for? Like you, I ain't never changing. See you at the races. I'll call you. If you need anything, you know where I'm at. Sure do. What the hell you gawking at? Just noticing how pretty you look this morning, Beau. There's a hundred boys out there that would love to have your job. I don't need me no stand-up comic. If I took your brain and shoved it up a gnat's ass, it would look like a bee-bee in a boxcar. Got any more gooduns? No, I don't, but I tell you, I need a vacation. For what? For the rest of my life. Give my regards to Roy Rogers, would you? Oh, my God. Hey, Wendell. Wendell. Hasta la vista. I'm telling you, you put your money on Wendell Scott, you can't lose. I'll take a piece of Wendell. How much a piece you want? No money, man, but I got a midnight auto supply. You talk to Woodrow at the garage. I handles the money. How about some money? Howard, please, please, what can I tell you? Drivers cannot be champions unless they have sponsors, and Danville needs a champion. Oh, shit... Hell, I know what colour he is. If we're to continue to do business together, you've got to learn to be colour-blind. Thank you. I knew you'd see it that way. Thank you. Add Howard Verner to the list. Wendell. Look what I got for you. All right. Yeah. Genuine Firestone tyres. Don't be standing around because I'm here. Get to working. Don't ask me how or where I got them. Just be glad that I got them. Wendell Jr., check those tyres. How you doing? I'm doing fine, man. Somebody ain't going to be racing Saturday. I can see that. That's for sure. But we know you'll be racing Saturday. These boys look like they're working. I'm going to check on them and see if they're doing a good job. They're damn good boys, Peewee. Oh, yes. Damn good. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the International Speedway for this afternoon's Grand National competition. There are literally thousands on hand to see the gigantic field of competitive Grand National automobiles. The big story of the day is car number 1, driven by Beau Welles, who drives on the pole. We welcome back on the circuit an old rival of Beau Welles, Wendell Scott of Danville, Virginia, in his familiar blue and white car number 34, who's making his first appearance on the track after his near-fatal crash a year ago. Scott and Welles have been door handle to door handle competitors before, but the contest in this Grand National will be between car numbers 1 and 49, G.C. Spencer. Our starting line-up for this afternoon's event will be car number 1, Beau Welles, starting on the outside of row number 1. On the inside of row 1, number 4, Bill Michelle. Get ready. I'd stop worrying about it, Wendell. She ain't coming. Mum said she can't stop you from racing, but she don't have to watch. Here you go. Let's get going. Wendell. Daddy. Honey. Honey. I'm sorry. I just couldn't stay home. I had to be with you. Everything will be all right. Don't worry. Go on and win this race. Go on. Got to run, dad. Drivers, in your cars. Ok, boss. Get it now. Welcome to the International Speedway for this afternoon's competitive field stock car racing. And, ladies and gentlemen, the Grand National race of 1970 is underway. Pace car drops down on the apron. We look for the green from Johnnie Bruner Jr. The green flag is out. Turn number one, it's Beau Welles down the number one-two corner. With him is G.C. Spencer. Car number 49 pulls up. They're racing back to the flag. Off the number four corner, it's Beau Welles with G.C. Spencer, Phil Harris. Wendell Scott begins to fall below the pace. What position is he running? Eighth place, and he ain't running. All right, come on. Come on now. He's afraid, man. In the turn number one, as he cranks it up, it's Beau Welles, G.C. Spencer. Wendell Scott begins moving up in the pack. He's passing number 31 into the sixth spot. Wendell Scott has found that extra burst of power. He's passed number 82 and moved into the fifth spot. This could be the big surprise of the afternoon. All right. Come on. We may have a blown engine in turn number four. A blown engine in car number 39. He spins. The yellow flag being drawn out here at the International Speedway this afternoon. Welles is going to the pit. Beau Welles, car number 1, drops down to pit row. Wendell Scott comes in behind him. Wendell Scott could have been making up valuable time if he had not had to pit. However, he's on pit row, and Wendell Scott is losing important time. Come on. Woodrow, move it. Beau Welles is back on the speedway with only 20 laps to go. Kick the jack out. I got to go. Kick it out. Hey, Wendell. Where's he going? Important time on the speedway. Your wheel. Wendell. Where's he going? Wait a minute. Scott's crew's trying to get him back. There's trouble. Wendell Scott, one of his wheels is missing three lugs. Scott is ignoring his crew. He's taking the chance the wheel will hold. Wendell Scott has gone around the Jim Vanbron Mobil and takes the fourth spot. Beau Welles has got the pressure on, but Wendell Scott is on the move. His wheel is smoking with five more laps. Wendell Scott is taking a chance of a lifetime. Beau Welles, G.C. Spencer. Wendell Scott now moves to third. He tries a barrel-haired turn of the wheel. Scott takes the two spot and pulls to the rear bumper of Beau Welles. It's Beau Welles and Wendell Scott. Here comes Scott making his move down the inside. Scott dives down on the apron. It's Wendell Scott of Danville, Virginia, trying to make the bid of a lifetime. Beau Welles still fighting the pressure on his rear bumper. It's still Beau Welles and Wendell Scott as they go to turn one. Welles and Scott continue to settle the grudge of the year. As Wendell Scott makes a comeback at the International Speedway this afternoon. Scott again dive-bombs, rim-riding. Beau Welles holds a nose lead with Wendell Scott alongside. They're locked in, door post to door post as they move down in back stretch. The field comes down off the banking in turn four. Beau Welles has the competition. Ladies and gentlemen, Wendell Scott moves up into first place. White flag is out. One lap to go. The field comes down showing Wendell Scott in command. Beau Welles riding second. The wheel is wobbling. If it holds another half lap, it will be the most dramatic finish in the history of Grand National racing. Dramatic action this afternoon at the International Speedway. Wendell Scott going around Beau Welles onto the turn four.
