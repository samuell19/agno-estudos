This is a story about two feuding families and two children who loved each other, Romeo and Juliet. Oh, Romeo! It's only your name that's my enemy. "Fwom" now on I will never be "Womeo" again. "Womeo"?? That won't do, Jimmy Five! How long will you say "W" instead of "R"? You need to stop that! What do you want me to say? Say... From now on, that is no longer my name. You can call me "my love", because I love you, Juliet! -Go, you can do it. -Okay. "Fwom" now on, that is no longer my name. You can call me my love, because I lov... Why? I lov... Jimmy Five! I can't, Monica. It's too hard. Just say "I love you, Juliet!" It's cheesy. Cheesy. Maggy, your scene. -You know your lines, right? -Yes. Nurse, I'm hungry. Of course, Miss Juliet. Here's your... dinner. Where is it? Sorry. I couldn't help it! But I can fix it. Done. -Try not to eat this time. -Okay. Nurse, I'm hungry. Of course, Miss Juliet. Here's your dinner. Dear Nurse, I need a friend so badly. Let's share the dinner. Of course! Maggy! You were supposed to say "No"! Monica, this character doesn't make any sense. You can eat, but first, say your line. I can't wait that long. Let's skip to the Friar scene. Come, Smudge. Why his scene first? Because it's not cheesy. Go ahead, Smudge. By the power vested in me I bless this marriage. Smudge! Is this rice? -It's holy rice! -It was supposed to be holy water! Holy water or rice, it's pretty much the same. You can't even let your hand get a little wet? Wanna switch roles? I can say the R and "I love you." -I'm the main "chawacter"! -Let's stop fighting, please? It's my cue and I'm going to get Samson. No! Any problem? -No. -None. It's just that Juliet doesn't have a stuffed bunny. And Romeo is not "Womeo." -No, stop! -No, Monica! It doesn't make sense for Juliet to have Samson. -"Wight" Smudge? -Yeah. Don't you want a perfect play? Juliet doesn't have Samson. Are you up to something? -No. -Then I'll get Samson. No! Jimmy Five? "Wun"! What's going on here? It's that Monica... Wait, one at a time, guys. Fine. Calm down. Enough! ...and there are no more snacks! Guys, it's always the same fight. Won't you ever grow up? Actually, we did grow up. Sorry. What about your homework? Let's go. I want to see it. Homework. Enough bickering. Homework, reminds me of the lesson... Monica, aren't we going to sign the play up for the festival? -It's too much work. -We should try something easier. And shorter. -Is there still time to sign a play up? -Just fill in the information. Okay. Thank you. -Hi, Monica. -Hi, girls. Hi! -Hi, Monica. -Hi. -Hi, Monica. -How's everything? -Hi, Monica. -Hi. Hi! Hi, girls. LEMON TREE STREET SCHOOL So, we'll do it like this. When you give the poison to Juliet, I'll say my lines "vewy" slowly. "Oh, Juliet, I can't live without you!" Then you get Samson. Perfect plan. You can't stop thinking about Monica, can you? One word, Smudge. "Wuler" of the "stweet." Ruler of the street is four words, dude. Let me go! Give it back! Easy, man! I'm just taking your homework. Give it back "wight" now! What are you gonna do about it? Call your bucktoothed friend? Call who, Tony? No one. Jimmy Five, Tony's gone, you can calm down. That's not it. I didn't do my homework. Me neither. Neither did I. Oh, no! We rehearsed all day long. Let's tell the teacher. No! Wait! We need a plan. What? Run away from school? I love the idea. The plan is... Are you nuts? I was joking! Here's the plan. Let's jump the wall, go into town do our homework and come back "tomowwow". -That's the worst plan ever. -There's ice cream in town. It's a good plan! Maggy! -Let's go. -No. -No, guys. -Chill out. Pay attention, everyone. Let's go. -Maggy, "gwab" one of those chairs. -Okay. "Huwwy" up, Monica. Come on! Pull, Jimmy Five. I can't. Jimmy Five, hold her tight. It's not my fault! -What was that, Jimmy Five? -Nothing. Go ahead! You can do it! Pull me up! -Jimmy Five! -Monica! Pull me up! Harder, please! -I'm going to fall! -I'm "twying"! Come on! Come on, Jimmy Five! Pull me up! I'm falling! Come on, Jimmy Five! Pull! Well, in the end we got a warning anyway. If it was just a warning, that would be okay. Your plans never work. When will you learn? It wasn't my fault, it was Mo... We're very worried. -It's the second time theyâ€™ve run away. -No. That time they didn't run away they only went after Fluff and found him. You think they're spending too much time together? They've been together since kindergarten. Their friendship has become a comfort zone for them. And kindergarten has been over for a long time. My suggestion is to put them in some extracurriculars. It will occupy their time they'll meet new children, have new experiences. It will be very good for them. It may be difficult but necessary, right? For them to spend some time apart. Especially for Monica. For Jimmy Five too. But it wasn't Jimmy Five who ended up with a broken arm. But it's him that comes home injured every other day. -Because he teases Monica. -Sousa, you know very well... They are growing and need to learn that actions have consequences. We want to put Maggy in a course to ease her anxiety. And her hunger. Something to put Smudge in the water would be perfect. And something to help Jimmy Five's speech impediment? Well, we appreciate the suggestion, but it's not what we want for Monica. -Excuse us. -Good evening. -See you later. -Thank you, Principal. Thank you. Your father and I have decided that you're going to switch schools. It'll be good for you, sweetie. I don't want to. Change is natural, sweetie. It's part of everyone's life. You'll stay at school for the full day there are a lot of after-school activities. When can I see my friends? Sweetie, when I was young, it was when I switched schools that I made my best friends. -My friends for life. -I don't want new friends. Monica! Let her go, honey. She'll calm down. Let her. Good morning! Time to wake up! It's too early. I know, but the new school is farther away. Let's go. I'll drive you there. I want to walk. I know, but if you walk, you'll have to wake up even earlier. So, let's go. Brush your teeth. Cheer up! Let's go, sweetie. We're already late. Let's go. Cheer up! Are you taking Samson to school? -Hi, Jimmy Five. -Hi. -Hi, Jimmy Five. -What's up? -Hi, Jimmy Five. -What's up? Hi, Jimmy Five. Aren't you full of yourself! Why so happy out of the blue? -I'm the "wuler" of the "stweet." Got it? - Congratulations, ruler of the street. But what do we do now? Huh? Hmm? Here we are, sweetie. New school. STATE SCHOOL Sweetie, it's going to be okay, all right? Let's go. Have a good day! Hi. Where's room 3? Girls, where's room 3? Today we're going back in time back to the time of cavemen and women. Hello. Are you the new student? Uh-huh. -What's your name? -Monica. Big baby! Playing with stuffed animal. John, speaking of our lesson today, let's take a trip back in time? Monica, can you leave and come back again, please? Monica? What do you say, John? Hi, Monica. Monica, you can sit over there. Isn't it cool to change history? If you want to copy. Here. Humanity began to build, continuously and regularly stone tools in specific shapes and for specific purposes. -Maggy! -What? -Let's play? -No, Milena. -Why? -I haven't finished eating. No? Let's enjoy recess. I will... Get more food. -School is boring without Monica. -Smudge, you're too pessimistic. "Twy" to look on the "bwight" side. The school is ours now! At least we'll stop getting beat up on, right? There you go. Look who it is, piggy and the "fweak". Without bucktooth. Hi, Monica! I also want a potato bread a roll, two bananas a fruit salad, a tuna sandwich with egg and an egg sandwich. So, cancel the tuna sandwich? No. Don't cancel anything. Hurry up. I just want a cheese bread. And a cheese bread! Just for you or for Monica too? I want everything in the cafeteria. She won't eat it all herself. It's a waste of food. Who created this monster? "Wun," Smudge! "Wun"! Go! Free ice cream in the cafeteria! "Wun"! Calm down, please! Thanks, Maggy! Out of the way! It's really cool being ruler of the street. Running away like this. I'll take care of Tony later. "West" assured. I can't later, I have my swimming lesson. They "weally" went overboard, didn't they? Yeah. This evening I have speech "thewapist." What? Speech "thewapist." Speech therapist? That's what I said. You think Monica's doing well at her new school? Yes. Anyone with a cast on their arm ends up being famous in school. True. I'll grab your nose and twist it. What's the problem, kid? No problem here, but if you want, we can arrange it. Making new friends, Peter? Yeah, we were chatting. Is everything okay? I gave him my apple, he thought I was calling him fat. -I know you from somewhere. -I just don't like apples. Eating is gross! -Aren't you Junior, Maggy's cousin? -She's the best cousin ever! She really is awesome, isn't she? Well, she eats my lunch. That's what cousins are for. Do you want it? -You have to eat to grow. -You sound like my mom. If I write Maggy a note, can you give it to her? -Are you sure you don't want it? -No, Junior. -Make sure she gets it, please. -All right. In today's class, we'll learn how to make a fruit trifle, with a magic touch. Maggy? Let's get to the good part? Eating! No, that's later, Maggy. First, we need to prep the ingredients. We need to put on our aprons so we can start prepping. I made some very cool notebooks for you to write down our recipes. Look how cool. See? Sweet and salty. We'll write down all the recipes, starting with this one. Go on, dear. Aunt Nina, Maggy ate it all! It's taking a while, "wight"? I have things to do, I don't know about you but "pwetty" soon I've gotta "wun". Not "one" like the number, "wun" like a "wace". Not "waste" like "twash" but a "wace" where you "wush." "Wush" like make a "bweak" for it. Not "wake." "Bweak" like a "west," you know? Now I know why they put me in speech "thewap..." That. But you'll see. By the end I'll be saying the R "wight." -But not "wight" like the color... -Hmm-hmm. -You understood me, didn't you? -Hmm-hmm. Hi, mister. -Want a snack? -Oh! -This one... -Oooh! And this one. -Thank you, kid. -Anytime. -Your mom will be proud of you. -Yes, she really will. -Bye. -Bye, thanks. I see you think it's opposite day. I can play that game. Keep your clothes on. It worked. Get ready! -Hey! Are you copying me? -I don't even know you. -Where's your swimsuit? -I'm not taking the class. Darn! That's even more original. -Where are you going? -I'm leaving. I'm gonna jump out the window. No! Wait! I came through the door if you go out the window, I'll have no way out. -Thanks, dude. -No! Darn! I'm stuck here. Junior! Did you give Maggy the note? Did you? Did she answer? Nothing? Nothing. But did she read it? Well, I have to go. Bye. "Hi, Maggy. It's me, Monica. How are you? Is everything okay? I'm not okay. I don't like the new school. The kids here are different. I don't want to be their friend. But my mom said I need new friends. Because I'm growing up. I guess I don't like growing up. I miss you and Smudge and even Jimmy Five. Don't tell him but I miss his foolproof plans. From your friend, Monica." Good morning, sweetie. Good morning. Sleep well? I want to see my friends. The Lemon Tree Street Festival is coming up. We have to work on the play, the rehearsal, the costumes a lot of things. I know, sweetie. Remember I saw you rehearsing that day? It seemed so difficult, so complicated. Only four children putting on such a big play. Hard, right? But we can try. You can try. Sure. Sweetie, There are drama classes at the new school. You should try it, take a class. Monica? This is the hardest phase the cocoon. The caterpillar will grow in here until it's too tight. Eventually, she'll need to break the cocoon. It's not easy but only then will she become a beautiful butterfly ready to fly. This whole cycle is called metamorphosis. Homework. One page about the butterfly's transformation. You can do it alone or in pairs. Hi, want to pair up with me? Want to join me? Can we eat here? Eh, here we have more "pwivacy." I liked it better when Monica was here. Smudge, be more optimistic in this new "ewa." New era? With Tony breathing down our neck? Like I'm afraid of Tony. You scared me, Maggy! Can I stay with you? I'm not afraid of you. -Can't hear you from up here. -What are you calling me? Short-y. I'm doing you a favor, okay? Maggy? -Guys, I have a big problem. -What? -No more hot dogs from Mr. Bill? -I'm serious! It's just... I can't stand eating anymore! Since Monica left it seems the monster in my belly is 10 times bigger. I don't know what else to do. I think I'm sick. Jimmy Five, this is a problem of global proportions! Maggy will eat all the food in the world! We have to do something. We have to stock up on food, "wight" now. Nice! But first, let's fix Maggy, ok? Look at this. Jimmy Five I need a foolproof plan to bring Monica back. There's no way. Our "pawents" won't let us. Guys, I need my best friend. Don't you miss her? I don't miss getting beaten up. Maggy! -Hi. -Are you okay? When I'm sad I like to pet animals. -Want to try? -So cute! -What's his name? -He doesn't have one yet. My mom just found him. He's going up for adoption. Cool. -What about, Vanilla? -Vanilla? I look at him and all I see is Vanilla. Ah, Maggy... -Can I hold the basket? -Sure. He is so cute. -You're awesome, Milena! -You too. Hi, "fweak." Calm down,Tony. I don't... Yum! Dinner will be delicious! I know. Son! -Hi, sweetie. -Hi,darling. Hey! Where's Samson? Didn't you take him to school? I lent him to a friend. Ah, lent? It's nothing. I was playing with my "fwiends" then Tony turned up when I was going after Monica. I already told you to stop teasing Monica. -It wasn't Jimmy Five. -It wasn't Jimmy Five? -Are you sure? -Yes. It was Tony, not Monica. That's enough! You can't play with her anymore. -You're standing up for him. -I don't even see him. Monica, enough! It's always the same thing! Won't you ever learn? It's always him. I don't want you around him anymore! Sorry, sweetie. Don't... Sorry. I overreacted, okay? You'd better stay away from Monica. Sometimes we overdo it. It's because I care a lot. You're right. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Marina, and yours? Monica. Does it hurt? Sometimes. It's so boring. Can I draw on it? -You can draw? -Yeah. What do you want me to draw? I can draw a house a dog, a cat, a unicorn. A bunny. What color? You scared me, dude! You can't do that! Why not? It's not allowed? -You almost gave me a heart attack! -Oh, come on! I'm afraid of water. Hmm... weird. Weird? You pop out of the water with a giant helmet and I'm the weird one? -I like weird people. -I thought you didn't like anything. -Always going against the grain. -You too. You don't bathe! Dude, even I take a bath. My parents put me in swimming to help me get over my fear. But it's too hard. Too bad. Bad? Why? In the pool, you are just another guy but out there you are unique. Unique? If you learn to like water you'll be just like everyone else. So, you're telling me never to bathe? No. You don't have to do what I say. This chocolate pie will be ready in 40 minutes. Forty minutes? You know how many I can eat in the meantime? Aah, Maggy, you are too anxious. But cooking can help you, you know? Instead of just thinking about eating what about enjoying the process of making the food? Forty minutes is a long time. I can't wait that much. Just a second. Come here. Tell me. What do you like to do besides eat? Play with my best friend. It's just that she left school. What if we play at cooking but for real? We have five senses. Taste is just one of them. It's beautiful to see. Isn't it nice to feel it with your hands? Smell and even hear it transforming. In the kitchen, taste comes last. Why is this pie so delicious? Because you had fun while you made it. So, to stop being so anxious I just need to have fun? Yes, and enjoy the moment. Not just in the kitchen. There are people who do sports. Others, handicrafts. Some people adopt pets. Aunt Nina, next class, can you teach me to make vanilla cream? Jimmy Five, see you next Tuesday, 4pm. -How much longer until I can say the "R"? -Patience, it's a process. -You're not much of a talker, are you? -Uh-uh. So, if I tell you a "secwet," you can keep it? Uh-huh. Well, I have a "fwiend." -Hmm... -It's not like that. We're doing a play together and she wants me to say "You can call me my love -because I lov..." -Hmm. It's a silly "expwession," you know? I thought I'd be happy being the "wuler" of the "stweet", but I'm not. Do you think I should talk to her? Umm-hmm. Say what? Hi? Umm-hmm. What then? "Impwovise"? Umm-hmm. Thanks, dude. You "weally" know what's up. Hummer, come in. Hi. Hi. I... can I sign your cast? There's no space. Is "evewything" okay? Sort of. You'd better go. My mom doesn't want you here. What did I do? She thinks you stole Samson. Someone stole Samson? Mm-Hmm. Who? Big Peter. A boy from my school. -He can't! Only I can do that! -Jimmy Five it's a stuffed animal. A childish thing. It's not worth it. Grow up. Make new friends. I did. You should do it too. Hello? I can't be at home and see him hanging from the window of my daughter's room! The other day, he came home injured again. Unbelievable, Liz. You have to control this girl. No, excuse me, but it's you who has to control Jimmy Five. He has been a bad influence on Monica that's why I don't want him here anymore. Monica is no longer welcome here either! -Hi, Milena. -Hi. -That cat that was up for adoption. -Vanilla? Yeah. Was he adopted? - No, he's still with my mom. - Really? I keep thinking about him. Every time I eat something with vanilla I think about Vanilla. Can I keep him? -I'll ask my mom to talk to yours. -Thanks! I knew he would be yours. -Maggy, come here. -Just a minute. -It's "sewious." -What? We need a plan to get Samson. After all this, you still wanna steal him from Monica? Not "fwom" Monica, for Monica. A boy "fwom" her school stole Samson. We need to help her. But how do you know all this? Did you go to her house? -Mmm... -Are you in or not? Hi. It's him! Let's go. Let's "woll." I know I'm gonna regret this but what's the plan? Want to learn new ways to preserve nature and rethink our consumption? Come see our recycling stall at Lemon Tree Street Festival. Our products are made from 100% recycled material. Whoever wants to chat about recycling will get a bamboo straw for free. Come to the Lemon Tree Street Festival! Our stall is gonna be a big hit. Curly, watch out! Are you okay? -Sorry. -I'm so sorry. Did you get hurt? I can sew it for you. She's good at it. What's your name? I'm Tina. -What? -Hi, how are you doing? I'm going to get a kitten and he needs a litter box. So, I'm selling these cupcakes... Please open the door! What is it, girl? Cut it out! I'm trying to sleep! What a pain! Is it banana? Yes! And I made it myself. Want to tell me what happened? Think it over, ok? When you grow up, you'll have to pay someone to listen. I hate growing up. When we grow up, we lose friends, stop playing. Everyone says it's cool. But I hate it! There! Is it good? Come here, I want to show you something. How can we not find it? It's just a blue bunny. I know! I've got it. It's low calorie, doesn't cause gas or pimples. -I don't have pimples. -But you're gassy. Uh... two for one? I'll be right back. Smudge! Hide! "Wight" now! Open... Stop! Get it off! Stop! I'm telling you to get it off, you brat! Stop! I can't breathe! Get that sock off me. -Where's Samson? -Yeah, where is it? Get that sock off me. If you don't tell us, I'll get the other sock. No, please, don't! I'm gonna puke! Don't do that to my cupcake! I'll tell you! -Tell us! -I'll tell you. Okay. I threw the bunny in the trash yesterday. -If he "thwew" it out yesterday... -The garbage truck already came. I know where to go, guys. Sorry. I'm sorry about the sock. I overdid it. It's just that Samson is important to our friend. Sorry for the trouble. Take the cupcakes. You did something I always wanted to do. "Wespect." Let's go. What is this made of? It's a plastic bottle. Here we reuse everything. It's a recycling stall. Our VW van, bench made out of tires. My friends. You already know Curly. Check out what I just made. Charming. These are my friends too Puff and Steve. -Hi! And look what I just made you, baby. Baby! I can't believe it! Look, it's the perfect keychain that we needed. Perfect indeed. See? Friends, toys. We do have fun. It's easy for you to say. Your friends are here. Mine have already forgotten me. Are you sure they've forgotten you? They made a new friend. But that's okay, I made my own, Marina. Isn't that growing up? I'll tell you what. When I was a child, I met Curly. We became very close. But then I grew up, and met Puff. We became best friends -and Curly was very jealous. -It wasn't jealousy I wanted Puff to be wiped off the map. Right, Puff? And I wish I had a quarter for every time Tina talked about Curly. And then, Puff met Steve. They started dating, but Steve and Curly became inseparable. And then I was the one who got jealous. You know what I realized? What was missing was bringing everyone together. You're the only one who can go inside. I know growing up is hard. But it doesn't have to be bad. Growing up is a blast! When something changes we don't need to throw it away. Look, we can... turn it into something else. That is growing up. It's for you. Aren't butterflies childish? We can grow up while still being a child. Thank you. Well? We need to do something. It's tar. It's almost impossible to get off. We can't tell Monica. No way! Do you "pwomise"? I promise. I promise. We'll never be apart again. No way. But it's not up to us. It's up to our parents. And my mom won't like this at all. Neither will mine. Strange! They were so close but now they only fight. Like Romeo and Juliet's parents. I have a plan! The play? So, are you in? I don't think so, Monica. I don't want to hold water. You don't need to, Smudge. Use the holy rice. Now you say that? Maggy, you don't have to wait to eat. -I can change the script. -No, Monica. Now I can wait. And Jimmy Five no need to say I love you, or even the R. But the festival is Saturday, how are we going to prepare everything? I know a person who can help us. Wow, amazing, Franklin! Cool, dude! You slayed it. Is there still time? Easy. About three weeks. Three weeks? We need it for Saturday. Only if I clone myself! -We can help you, right? -Uh-huh. -Just the four of you? -Not just the four of us. -Hi, Monica! -Hi, guys! Come on in. Come on in, guys. Wow! Is this Franklin's lab? -Uh-huh. -Nimbus? What? Hey, dude, what's up? Look that! So rad! Hi! Hi! Maggy talks so much about you. She talks a lot about you too. Nice to meet you! -Monica? -Hmm? Who's that girl next to Maggy? That's Marina, why? LEMON TREE STREET FESTIVAL Thanks. -Thank you! -Bye. Maggy... Maggy will love it. SAVE THE PLANET Go, horsie! Hi, horsie! Puff, love, I'm so romantic. Go, Junior! Go, horsie! Is it homemade? Liz. Mr. and Mrs. Five. Monica didn't come? Neither did Jimmy Five? And if it doesn't work out? Monica, if anyone can make it work, it's you. You think so? You make "foolpwoof' plans better than me. That's why we're Monica and "Fwiends". Let's start, guys? Nice festival. -Yes, it is. -Exciting. -It's great. -It's beautiful. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Lemon Tree Street Festival. I present, Romeo and Juliet. The story begins on a night with a full moon. I mean... on a sunny afternoon. Cute! There were two families. The Capulets and the Montagues. They were two feuding families. The Capulets had a daughter. Juliet. Sousa, did you un-grounded her? No, I didn't. And the Montagues had a son. Romeo. What's going on? They loved each other but their parents didn't want them to be together. Your daughter is trouble! You must control this girl! Don't try to turn the tables. He is a bad influence. -He can't step foot in my home! -She is not welcome here! But no one can stop fate. Oh, Romeo! It's only your name that's my enemy. "Fwom" now on, that is no longer my name. You can call me... Whatever you want. Our love is forbidden. Our families don't get along! I'll find a way, sweet Juliet. I'll fight for us. Or my name isn't... Romeo! He said it! He said it! He did it! "Wound the wugged wocks the wagged wascals wan." Oops! Darn. That's okay! It's fine! Balloons! Balloons! Sir, did you see a spiky-haired brat and his stinky friend? It depends. Do you feel, deep down, a desire to buy a balloon? No. So, no information. Okay, I'll buy it. Look at the stage. Art is the answer to all questions. Wait! The balloon! Unbelievable. I'm going to stop selling balloons. No one buys them. I'll sell information instead. Maggy, it's your cue. Miss Juliet? Miss Juliet? Where are you? -Did you call me, Nurse? -Yes. Here's your dinner. Dear Nurse, I need a friend so badly. Let's share the dinner. Miss Juliet, I can't eat while on duty. It's the house rules. I disagree with the house rules. Take it. Thank you. Won't you eat the apple? Now you can. Later. I want to watch the play. -Smudge, it's your turn. -Right! So, will you be like everyone else? I don't need to be different to be unique. We're gathered here to celebrate this marriage. Romeo, do you take Juliet as your wife? I do. Juliet, do you take Romeo as your husband? I do. By the power vested in me I bless this marriage. No, he didn't... It's water! He used water! Romeo and Juliet's love was not accepted by their parents. Longing to be together forever they try one last plan. Non-foolproof. Franklin! Did it work? It worked out great! Here. You're a genius, dude. What's up, "fweak"? Give it back! What are you gonna do, little Romeo? -Let him go! -Get off me! -Get out,Tony. -Let him go! Where could Romeo be? Where is Romeo? Where's Jimmy Five? I don't know. -Nimbus! -What? Do something! Do what? I've got it! Try this. To be or not to be that is the question. Get off me! Let me go! -Let him go, Tony. -I did. What are you gonna do? Call Juliet? You're alone, "fweak." But I'm not. Gimme. Now, get lost. Forever. Respect! Oh, Romeo! But everybody knows that Romeo and Juliet didn't have a happy ending. Uh... What if it were the other way around? What if love had won? Juliet, wake up. Juliet, wake up, please. What are you doing? Please, "twust" me. Wake up, Juliet. What happened? I have a "pwesent" for you. How? ANTI-TAR TONIC You can call me my love, because I love you, Juliet. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! -I'm sorry, Liz. -I'm sorry. Lemon Tree Street, let me see the lemonade! Let's take a photo! Great! -Sweetie. -Hi. -How's your arm, without the cast? -It's better. -Yeah? -Uh-huh. -Does it hurt? -No. Sweetie, let me see it. Looks like some things never change. We can grow up while still being a child. We can. We really can. Can you believe you taught me a lesson? I did? We never stop growing up. Never! Listen.
