[rock music playing] -Oh! Good morning. -Whattup, Katie? Let me guess. You're going to Venice Beach. You know it. Oh, would you stop foraging? -Sit down and eat something. -I can't, Mom. I'm late. Wait. Did you clean your room? That's why I'm late. -[laughing] Hey! -Hey, watch it. Whattup, Dad? English. That up. ♪ I've got a million things going around In my head ♪ ♪ And I never really paid attention To what you said, no ♪ ♪ And now I wish that I would have said good-bye ♪ ♪ But it's much too late ♪ ♪ And all I do is give And all you do is take ♪ ♪ Gonna understand ♪ He'll be here. He said he'd be here. Maybe something happened to him. I mean, maybe he got hit by a car. Or maybe his dad's back started acting up again, and they had to rush him to the hospital. [Gabriella] Or... Or maybe he got kidnapped by aliens. Don't joke. That happened to an uncle of mine. You're a lunatic. Do you know that? Oh, man. Great. This is the weekend. Do you know how long we'll have to wait for the next bus? Yo, guys. What up? Uh... lateness. Dude, chornage, my mom made me clean my room before I could leave. Fine, but we missed the bus. Now we're gonna be late and have to wait to use the pit. I don't think so. -[Brink laughs] -Wait a minute. Wait. You're not thinking about skating to the beach, are you? Why not, Jordy? You guys, it's like a million miles away. Jordy, Jordy, Jordy. When you woke up this morning, did you say to yourself, "Today I'm gonna talk," or, "Today I'm gonna skate"? Come on. Put 'em on. [laughs] I told you guys, this is gonna be the perfect start to the last day of summer vacation. Oh, man, why did you have to remind us? [all cheering, whooping] Yeah! All right! Whoo! Yeah! Whoa! Yeah! [cheering] Woo-hoo! Come on! Move it! Come on! Oh, yeah. High-five! -Come on, guys. -[laughs] Yeah! Come on, guys. Let's get some speed. Stop saying "guys" all the time. I'm not a guy. It's just an expression. Yeah? Well, so is "cut it out before I deck you." [all cheering, whooping] Ah! Move! Let's go! [Brink] Yeah, the pit! The pit! [Peter] Oh, yeah. Let's skate! [cheering] Yo, Peter. That was an ill grab, man. Jordy, that was sweet, man. Gabriella, watch that back leg. Watch your own back leg. Hey, yo. Check it out. He's from In.Line Magazine. What's he doing here? They must have heard about us. Cool. Let's go show 'em what Soul-Skating's all about. Hey, what's he waiting for? Here we go. Come on, boys. Here we go. Yeah! All right. Come on. Looking good, looking good. Move it. Move it. All right, give me some shots of the skates. Make sure you get the skates, and get Val center. Val, look hip. Look edgy. Look good. Sell it. Come on, work it. Team X-Bladz. Forget them. We've still got the pit, right? C'mon, big Pete. I want to see a 540. Let's go. [man in crowd] Yeah! Whoa! Come on, Team X-Bladz! -Ah! -[crowd groans] Ow, that hurt. [Brink] Oh, man. You got worked. You all right, bro? He tried to go bio on a 540. One and a half rotations horizontal in the air. Hmm... you do that, right? In my sleep. I'm never gonna get that 540. Sure you will, just not talking like that. Jimmy, I'm on a tight schedule here. Can we get these shots somewhere else? No. I gotta get a picture of the Bladz from the pit. I've just got to figure out how to get rid of these losers. -I know 'em. I'll just ask 'em to leave. -They'll do that for you? -Of course. -Cool. Let's go. C'mon, dude. Try to throw your shoulder into the rotation more. It'll help you out. Right. Thanks, man. Whoa, Brink! Whoa! [groans] Ow. [groans] Yo, man. Are you okay? Yeah, man. No problemo. Yo, Brink. What's up? Are you gonna do that at the invitational or save it for the championships? Say, you know what, Val? I don't think you skate so good anymore, man. I dunno. Maybe you should bag both competitions. Nah. Then I'd have to give back all this cool stuff. Oh, sponsored skaters. Big deal. It is a big deal. Team X-Bladz rules. Everybody knows that. Speaking of which, we've got a photo shoot we're trying to do here. Mind getting lost? Mind if I kick your butt? Wait. We had the pit first. You know how it is. Yeah, but we have it now. See, you guys left the pit. B.J.'s using it. Aren't you, Beej? Oh, man. You guys snaked and you know it. You guys should've left someone to save your place. You know how it is. Val, you are such a jerk. And that goes for you too, worm. Hey, Gabriella, ever get arrested for impersonating a boy? No. You? -Forget about 'em. -Maybe in a couple of years, they'll be good enough and someone will put their pictures in a magazine. Maybe not. Come on. Let's go. Check it out. I've got an idea. Excuse me. Can I ask you guys a question? -Yeah. -Um... all skateboarders aren't really wusses, are they? No! They all can't be no-talent, no-skill, half-smart, inline-skating wannabes. Am I right? What was that? Dude! Personally, I don't think that at all, all right? But that's exactly what those guys over there told us. Those guys said that? Yeah, man. Let's go. That was rough, man. Val's gonna freak. Hey! I heard you've been talking about me. If he lives. You got something to say, why don't you say it to my face? You been talking about me? You got something to say? [footsteps running] Yo! What's up, fam? It's just not normal, that's all. Ralph, please. No one should be that happy all the time. What's the matter with being happy? He's a great kid. -It's just not normal, that's all. -[Maddie chuckles] Do I have to go to school? Why can't I be home-schooled like the Wyatts? Now, you see, Katie is a normal child. Today's the first day of school, and she's miserable. Because, sweetheart, home-schooling is expensive. -Besides, the Wyatts are Mormon. -Why can't we be Mormons? -I'll look into it. -Yo! Let the games begin. Katie, you're the future of this family. Now, go to school. Are you ready for your first day of school? -Absolutely. -Then why don't you wear something that doesn't look like somebody just let the air out of? Dad, the kids at school are down with this style. Hey, so how's the back treating you today? Thanks, Mom. Well, if you ask me, I feel good enough to be going back to work already. Soon. Listen, Andy, are you sure you don't want me to drop you? Got it covered. What's for lunch today, Dad? What's your least favorite? Baloney on white with extra mayo. -That's what I made for you. -Ah, yeah! Peace out! [kids shouting indistinctly] -Hey, Pete, Jordy, what's up, guys? -Hey, Brink. Hey, you guys look bumming. What's going on? Nothing nine more months of summer vacation couldn't fix. Did you guys hear what happened to Gabriella? Is she okay? Dude, what happened? It's awful. -What? -She... It's too bad. I can't say it. No. I'm seeing things, aren't I? I didn't even know she owned one of those. It's a dress, man. [sighs] Anybody say anything and I'll hand you a body part. Hey, Gab, personally, I think it's phat. Mad cool. Right, guys? -Absolutely. Beautiful. -Totally. Yeah. Okay. Look. My mom made me wear this dress. "Back in Peru, all the girls wear dresses on the first day of school." I was like, "Ma, this isn't Peru." She says, "It is if I say it is." [Val] Heads up! Hey! Give me those. C'mon, man. Give 'em back. Why don't you get your skateboarder friends to make me? That was pretty dope, huh? Oh, yeah. I'm still laughing about it. Oh, now, that's dope. -Val, what is your problem? -Hey, man. -I thought we were just messing with 'em. -That's what we're doing. You narc on me, I'll know you're a bunch of wusses. [sighs] This is just great! [school bell rings] Here you go, man. If you don't lace 'em up, they'll probably fit you. See, I was planning on changing into some real clothes when I got here. You mean you're gonna go through an entire first day of school wearing those for me? Just take 'em before I change my mind, okay? Oh, man, did you guys see that? Soul Skaters. Together, there's nothing we can't do. That's right, guys. Soul Skaters. -Yes! -Right! [school bell rings] [male teacher] "Earthworm" is the common name that is given to over 1,000 different species of worms in a class of the annelid phylum. Earthworms are cylindrical in shape. [Peter] Yo, man. Are we gonna have Val on our cases all year? I got a plan. Brink, my man, Val's not exactly playing with the full deck. Let's not do anything we're gonna regret. [shushes] Hey. What's the plan? [teacher] ...grow as large as 11 feet. Imagine that. Oh, man! Oh, wow, I'm so sorry. [groans] -See ya, buddy. -Hey, you're not finished, man. What's his problem? He's a Soul Skater. That's his problem, dude. [squishing] Ugh! Worms! Is there a problem, Val? No. I thought I saw a bug or something. Well, get over it. [Brink] Hey. You know, in some countries, worms are considered a delicacy. -Go figure. -[laughs] You, us, right now, out back. Fight, fight! Hey, guys, check it out! Say, it's very nice, Val. Have you ever thought about working with garbage cans for a living? Do you ever give that mouth of yours a rest? I don't know. Do I? Personally, I just want to pound the snot outta ya. Boomer suggested a race instead. We race. You win, we stop giving you beef. You lose... and, man, it's like open season on your butts. -Deal? -Come on. You know there's no skating allowed at school. Yeah. I knew you couldn't step up. What did I tell ya? No heart. [boy] Oh, burn! Let's do it. Brink, you'll get in trouble, man. Dude, we're gonna have to skate against these guys sooner or later. Why not sooner? Yeah. Why not? All right, we go side by side. When you get to the relay point, you've got to slap the next guy's hand. Or girl's hand. Thank you. Whatever. Before he can go. Or "she" can go. -Thank you. -[Val] Chrissy, call the start. Let's go. All right, on your marks... You don't talk much. Get set... I like that in a man. Go! Come on, Gabriella, let's go. -Go, buddy! -Get ready to lose the race. Let's go! C'mon, Boomer, you wuss! Brink! What are you doing? Boomer, just lay still, man. This happened to me last summer. You just gotta lay still and lie down. Just don't get up. Kimball, go get the nurse. Tell her to bring some ice. -Go! -What are you doing? Dude, I'm gonna have the nurse take a look at it. Brink, man! The race! -Relax. Just relax. -You lost the race to help me? Brink, man, I don't get you. Take a number. What's going on? Teachers! Teachers! Nice. [Boomer groans] I think it's a record. I'm pretty sure it is. -Yo, Dad. Please. -What was it? Four and a half hours into the school year before being suspended? It's only for today. Besides, I can explain-- Don't, wait. I'll just read about it in the papers. A record like this has got to attract media attention. Dad, Val and his crew were dissing us, so we started giving 'em beef right back, and then they wanted to hit it right there. And, clearly, we couldn't step off, so we had to battle. Who are you? What have you done with my son? God, Dad... Don't they teach English at your school? Wait a minute. What am I asking you for? You haven't been there long enough to find out. Dad, you're not listening to me. Sure I am. You got dissed. You ate "beef." Did I miss anything? [car engine sputters] Great! Lovely. Just lovely. Well, let's recap, shall we? The car's gonna cost us $900. The dentist called to say that if we don't spend 300 bucks on Katie's night brace, she's gonna have a smile like a Picasso painting. I called Beckman today to see if there would be a job waiting for me when my disability was over, and he said that he couldn't promise anything, and your son was suspended from school on his first day. So, how was your day? It was fine. Sell any houses? Uh, no. Show any houses? No. Well, then, our troubles are over. Oh, come on. Be nice. Sorry. It's gonna be okay. Ralph, we have been through much worse than this. If you say so. Ralph, do you remember when you fell off that beam? Honey, we didn't even know if you were gonna walk again. Yeah. I'd say that was worse. And now look at you. Strutting around. You can't wait to get back to work. All I need is my job back. Don't worry about the money. We're gonna be okay. The mortgage isn't due until the first of the month. We'll figure it out. We always do. Well, there was screaming and then yelling, and then there was crying and hugging. It was all very Peruvian. How did your fam deal with it, Jordy? Well, there was sitting and staring... and then afterwards, there was some more sitting and staring. I mean, for all I know, my parents are still in the living room, sitting and staring. Yeah, well, Jerry handled it kinda the way it was done at Gabriella's. There was screaming, yelling, crying, and hugging. Only without the hugging. My mother was conveniently hiding in the next room. Hey, at least you got two parents. I got a Mom and a Jerry. Do the math. That's one parent. Look, guys, things got a little out of hand the other day, you know. We just gotta chill and let things blow over. All right? Hey, check it out. Jerkweeds at 02:00. Hiya, children. Excuse me, but I believe we out-skated your sorry butts yesterday, old man. -Anytime you want to go at it again-- -Cut it out. I guess you heard about Boomer? Yeah. How long's he gonna be out? A couple of weeks. For sure, he's out of the invitational. Means there's an open spot on the team. Yeah, right. Like we're gonna try out for Team X-Bladz. Like any of you have the talent. I'm telling you so that you grommets know you're not invited. Good. You told us. Now, beat it! [scoffs] You don't get it, do you? Being a sponsored skater is cool. I get all the newest gear whenever I need it, I get my picture in every skating magazine on the planet-- Oh, now I'm nauseous. And I make a lot of money. Just think about that. Being known as the best and getting paid at the same time. What could be sweeter? Hey, look. We don't care about any of that stuff. We skate for fun. We're Soul Skaters. Right, Brink? Right... right. Why is it that the losers always say they're in it for fun? C'mon. Could you believe that guy? -Skatin' for money. -What a sellout. Think he'll show? You know it. Okay, dude, give us the 540. I want to see it laid out and inverted. You can do it. Aw, man. There's gotta be a better way to do this. There is. Don't fall. You okay, dude? Yeah, man. Hey, what's up with you today? You're looking so sketchy. Nothing, man. I'm fine. Cool. Hey, guys, look, I gotta get going. I've got this family thing this afternoon. Wait a minute. What about our session? The invitational's in two weeks. It's the last competition before the championship. Yeah, I know. Look, you guys keep on training, and Peter, keep working on that 540. And I'll do some of my own stuff on my own, all right? -Okay. -All right. Bye. [loud rock music playing] [music stops] All right. That's it for now. I've got your numbers. I'll call you if you made it. What about Brad? No good. Too buckled. -Right? -Yeah. Markoff? No way. Nobody wants to session with him. We only need him for one month. And after that, never got to talk to him again. What do you think, Beej? No, man. I don't think so. Too bad your secret weapon was a no-show. I don't believe it. What did I tell ya? Watch this. No way, man. No way. How much? What? Does X-Bladz pay? How much? Well, $200 a week, plus all equipment. Plus an extra $200 bonus for each of us when we win tournaments, but there's no way I'm gonna let you on the team. Yeah, well, there's no way I wanted to be here but I need the money. What for, Grandma needs a new kidney? Besides, I thought you were a... What do you guys call that? Oh, Soul Skater. So, how about you turn around and "soul skate" on out of here? Yeah, Brink, man, get out of here. Fine. Wait a second. You've got 30 seconds. Street run. One chance. ♪ Okay, let's do it ♪ Time's up. How are you on vert? Just as good as street. Maybe better. -Downhill? -I can do it all. Hey, how about Peter and the rest? They know you're doing this? What? This is gonna be good. I can't wait to see the look on their faces. No way. Look, this is just through the invitational until Boomer's back on his feet. If this gets out, then I don't skate with you, and you've got nobody. You got that? Hey, we won't say anything, but you have to be at every practice. All right. And... no more bagging on me in front of people. From now on, you start showing me some respect. You got that? Yeah. I got it. Let's go see Jimmy. Oh! You went big there, my man. [laughs] You see, Andy-- Oh, you mind if I call you Andy? Brink. I like Brink. Brink. I love that. Brink. [laughs] Yeah. See, that's what X-Bladz is all about, my man, going big. I'm in 1,200 outlets nationwide. Last year, I moved over $10 million worth of merchandise. And all because of Team X-Bladz. So, I guess the big question is, are you ready to go big for X-Bladz? Big as you want. Did you hear that? As big as I want. You better watch your back. This boy here's liable to put you out of a job. [scoffs] Don't worry about that, Jimmy. So, Val told you about the money and how that works. You're okay with that, right? -Yeah. -All right. Then it's official then. You're part of the team. From now on, there'll be no competing unless you're flying the X-Bladz colors. -You got that? -All right. All right? I'm gonna need you 24/7 for, like, photo shoots, promos, industry shows, stuff like that. -Okay. -Okay. [chuckles] Well, then... Parents? Your parents know about this? -My parents? -They're down with this? -They're cool with this? -Oh, my parents. Yeah. All right. Okay. Well, then, welcome to Team X-Bladz. What's up, Katie? What's in the bag? Just my stuff. You got more stuff now than when you left. What's in the bag? None-ya. None-ya? None-ya-business. [chuckles] Whoa... Oh, cool. Wait a second. Oh, man, what am I doing? [Ralph chuckles] Katie, honey, why don't you slow down a little bit? What's the point of having a fast metabolism if I don't use it? Well, she's got something there. Andy, are you okay? You've hardly eaten anything. Um... With Dad not working around here, and stuff, I think that maybe it's time I got a job to help out around here. You know, with the money, and stuff. Oh, Andy, that is a wonderful offer, but you don't have to do that. Mr. Beckman's gonna give Dad his job back. And I just showed a house today to some people. I think they're very interested. No, no, no. Wait a second. I think it's good. What kind of a job are you talking about? Well, I know these kids who make extra money skating. Skating? Yeah. You see, they got on a sponsored team, and then the sponsor pays them to wear their gear and stuff. It's kind of like... advertising. I thought you skated just for fun. Maybe he could save it for school. How much money does a sponsored skater make? A couple hundred a week. More if the team wins. Whoa. A couple hundred bucks a week. I like. That's a lot of money. No. But, Dad, I'm thinking, like, the car needs fixing. -No. -What? Isn't this the kid who was just suspended from school for... Jeez, what was it? Skating. Thank you, sweetheart. Skating. Yeah. What do we need him to be on a sponsored team for? So he can spend all of his time thinking about skating, instead of just most of it? Look, buddy, you want to get a job, I think that's great. But not skating. Dad, it's $200 a week. Not skating! So, Jordy, he hits the rail, pulls it halfway, and then he lands it right on his crotch! Oh, man, the poor dude got worked. I thought Gabriella was gonna need oxygen, she was laughing so hard. I thought he should put some ice on it, but he just kept saying, "No ice! No ice!" -[knocking] -[Jerry] I need the phone. Hold on a second. You can use it when I'm done. You know, we did okay after you took off, but it just wasn't the same without you. C'mon, man. You don't mean that. Excuse me? You're the captain of our team, remember? We can't have our captain missing any more sessions. Hey, Peter, there's something I gotta tell you right now, man. -Wait a second. -Now, Peter! I'm getting off. Brink, man, I'm sorry. Stepdad Of The Year is about to go postal on me if I don't let him use the phone. -I'll see you at school tomorrow. -Wait, wait. Pete, Pete! -[dial tone] -God! You need more baking powder. What? The recipe has a large T next to the number. That means tablespoon. A small T means teaspoon. -Why are you even watching me? -There you go. Hey, you okay, man? It's only a cake. Yeah, yeah. Hey, uh... Did you guys ever notice that baking a cake is a lot like friendship? Excuse me? No, I mean... All right. You put a lot of work into it, right? And sometimes it doesn't turn out the way you expected it to... but it still tastes good. I told you not to eat that spoonful of frosting. Yeah, man, sugar can mess you up. It's true. I have this cousin, and she's not allowed to eat any sugar. But one day, she had, like, four jellybeans and bounced off the walls like a pinball. -It was like-- -Shut up, Jordy. Please. Guys, there's something I'm trying to tell you. -There you go with that "guy" stuff again. -Gabriella, chill out for a second. I got to talk to you guys about the invitational. Oh, yeah. We're gonna have a good time, huh? -Sweet. -Hey, Betty Crockers. Oh, love the aprons. So, how's the training going? I mean, the invitational's right around the corner. Last two years, the team that won the invitational did go on to win the championship. Now, what team was that? Hmm... That's right. Team X-Bladz. Val, could you be any more of a jerk? No, I don't think so. Is that what you think? You think I'm a jerk? Uh... Come on, Val. We're working here, man. Hey, I asked you something. Do you think I'm a jerk? No. Excuse me? No. I don't think you're a jerk. Oh... Thank you. See you this afternoon, Brink. Yo, buddy. What happened? Yeah, what's up with that? You just let Val slime all over you. He's not worth it. What did he mean he'd see you this afternoon? Uh... Who knows? [rock music playing] Hey, man, good job. -Thanks, man. -That was rad, Brink. What was that? Excuse me? I just wanted to know what that was. Because if you call that going big, I'm gonna quit skating. Well, we're all gonna miss you, buddy. [laughs] Gotcha. Hit it again. You're kidding me, right? Hit it again. Come on, Val. He's doing okay. Who's running the show here? Who? You. That's right. Do it or vacate. Good doggy. Maybe something happened to him. Like what? And please don't start with that alien stuff again. Yo. Whattup? [Peter] Where've you been, man? We've been waiting here for two hours. I got to be home by 5:30. Jerry's having his boss over for dinner, and I gotta pretend I worship the ground he walks on. Well, then, what are we all doing standing around talking? Hey, did you guys hear? Val found someone to replace Boomer. Yeah, I heard that too. Yeah. I heard it too. I heard the guy was a big guy. Big guy. Like, Korean, I think. Wait, no. He was Native American. Yeah. That was it. -I heard he's really good. -Hey. I don't care how good he is, he isn't better than my man here. Look. That just means we've got to hit it twice as hard. So let's do it. Yeah. Let's do it. What's up, Dad? Trying to fix the beast here without any real knowledge of automotive mechanics. What's the matter with you? Nothing, really. I'm just a little tired. Too much skating? Skating? Too much? Me? No way. Well, you won't have to worry about that anymore. I got you a job. A job? My friend, Benny, he's got the dog grooming place. He's looking for somebody to help out a couple of afternoons a week. Well, that's great, Dad, but I don't know a thing about animals. You babysit your sister, Katie, don't you? Can't be a lot different than that. Come on. What's wrong? I thought you wanted to help out around here. Oh, no, Dad, I do. I just don't have the time for a job right now. Why? And please don't tell me skating. Because you know what my response is going to be. When do I start?

Hey, man. I came as soon as I could. How're you feeling? Not so good. [coughing] You look terrible. You're soaked with sweat. I know, man. Look. I can't make it to the invitational today. I'm sorry. Hey, no big. Just feel better, okay? Yeah. Could you do me a huge favor and get me a tissue over there? Sure. [coughing] -Here you go. -Thanks, man. [coughing] Hey. You'll tell the others for me? Sure. Hey, we'll go down there and check it out anyway. No! [groans, coughs] I mean, no, man. Don't. I mean... You know, the invitational, it's only a warm-up for the championship. You guys should session instead. Okay. You're the boss. -Take it easy. -All right, man. Oh, man! [music playing] [cheering] No, grommet, I told him to be here an hour ago. He'll be here. Since when did you start sticking up for him? Hey. What do you think you're doing? Hey, guys. So, what's with the shades? It's a look. There's nothing wrong with a look. Yo, X-Bladz. You're up. Well, that look of yours better come with some skating attached. [air horn blares] This is nuts! We should at least check out the invitational, see who our competition is. Yeah. Maybe get a glimpse of the X-Bladz mystery man. Come on, guys. Brink said we should session. And we will... after. Come on. We should at least catch the last round. Are you coming? [male announcer] Next up, Nicky Grimes, Team Five Gear. [crowd cheering] -[cheering] -[air horn blares] [camera clicks] -92! -All right! Great job! Team Five Gear. Look at that! We need at least a 96 to win. I've been carrying your sorry butts all day, and I'm just about ready to drop all three of you. And you. I thought you were supposed to be something. "As big as you want." Well, I want real big. And I want it right now. You got that? I got it. Next up, Andy "Brink" Brinker. Three. Two. One. Go. [crowd cheering] That must be the new kid. He doesn't look Korean. That's because he's not. [air horn blares] Whoo! [laughs] How was that? I'll tell you in a few seconds. 97. Team X-Bladz. [cheering] My man, Val! -Hey! All right! -And, you, my man. Now, I knew you would be good, but I did not know you would be great. -Thanks, Jimmy. -You guys killed! You're gonna be unstoppable at the championship. Look. I got a little something, huh? It's a bonus for winning. $200. Not bad for a day's work, huh? I knew it! All those excuses! All that sneaking away! You ditched us so you could join these sellouts. -Gabriella, I can explain everything. -Explain how you lied to us? How you bailed out on us so you could join Team X-Bladz? Do you have any idea how many times I stuck up for you? Peter... And your stupid fever? Come on. -Come on, wait. I can explain-- -All right, play time's over. I say we get together tonight and go over some drills for the championship. Well, looks like we just lost our fourth man. I don't think so, Jimmy. Okay, it's like this. We need four people to compete in the championship, right? We'll get Benjy. No. Not Benjy. His style is so sketchy. She's right. He's like two steps above a poser. I know. But we just get him to sign up with us, and then we keep rotating ourselves in instead of him. Yeah, but what about the downhill? Which one of us could handle that? All right. We'll go check out the downhill course. See who can do it. How about me? Um... Okay if I sit down? Sure. It's okay. Wait. You guys, come on. I quit Val's team. I quit! You want to know the difference between them and me? You bailed on them, and you bailed on me. The difference is... I'm willing to be your friend again. Boomer's not going to be ready for the championship. Them? They're going nowhere fast. But us... we got a championship to win. All right. Welcome back. It's just not normal, that's all. He's tired and he's a teenager. Nobody's that unhappy all the time. I mean, it's been two weeks. Didn't you used to complain because he was too happy? Yeah. I guess I just hoped he'd settle somewhere in the middle. It's so depressing to talk to him. And what about his friends? They're still mad at him over something. He won't say what. Why don't you talk to him? -Me? -Yeah. Talk to Brink? -You mean with words? -Yeah. You know how hard it is for me to have a conversation with him? I know. Such a moody little sack of hormones. -[both] Katie. -Fine. Honey. Talk to him. He needs you. Go on. Go. Yo, Dad. Yo. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. [sighs] So... I haven't seen Peter or Jordy for a while. Why's that? Just a thing. A thing. All right. Answers that question. Everything okay with them? Yeah, Dad. It's fine. Is that "fine" as in "good," or "fine" as in "leave me alone"? I don't know, Dad. I just don't feel like talking about it, okay? Okay. It's none of my business. [sighs] Except... Andy. You're my son. Taking care of you is my business. You can tell me or don't tell me. It's okay. But that doesn't change my job description. If you change your mind... I'm here, buddy. [sighs] The championship has three parts-- street, vert, and downhill. This is gonna be the downhill course. The two teams with the highest scores on street and vert send one person right here. Yo! Earth to Brink! Pay attention. What are you looking at? Well, I was just thinking how fun it might be to do a launch off one of those driveways right there, go up and over the roof of the next house, and land right back on the road below. Fun? Yeah. Fun. Well, if you don't mind coming back from fantasy land for a minute... This is about winning. Not fun. [Gabriella] Oh, this is just great. I guess they'll let anybody skate here. -What, are you guys following us? -We came to use the downhill course. Well, when we're done with it, it's all yours. When's that gonna be? After the championship. [all snickering] -Come on, now, run along. -This is a free country. We can be here if we want. Look. If you don't like it here, why don't you go back to Mexico? I'm from Peru, estupido. I'll make you a deal. How about we race to see who stays and who goes? One of you against one of us. Come on, man. Just let 'em have it. Why don't you just stay out of this? Yeah. We can handle ourselves. Let's see. Who's skating for your crew? -Me. -[laughing] Cool. -You ready? -What? You against Gabriella. Whoever loses has to take off. And you'd better not lose, man. Come on, man. You can't make me do that. Come on, man. What, are you afraid? I'm not skating against you. Why not? You've been doing it for weeks. Cool. We'll go down to the beach. First one there wins. I'll skate down to the finish line to make sure there's no cheating. There's a big turn just before Kettner. Stay on the outside. What? Wait. You never stay on the outside of a turn. Just do it. Gabriella, please don't do this. When you woke up this morning, did you say to yourself, "Today, I'm gonna talk," or "Today, I'm gonna skate"? -Okay. On your marks! -Oh, and... -Get set. -...don't hold back. Go! -[Gabriella] Whoo! -Did you see that? Whoa. -Gabriella, move to the outside! -Yeah, right. [exclaims] Oh... [groans] Oh, man! -[Peter] Gabriella! -[Jordy] Gabriella! Gabby. What happened? Val? I don't know. -[Jordy] Gabriella? -[Peter] She's hurt, man. Oh, no. Oh, man.

Come on. Gabby? [Gabriella sighs] I'm really sorry. I honestly didn't think anyone would get hurt. Then I guess for once you didn't think of everything. But, Gab, you gotta understand-- You were the one who told me about Soul-Skating. About skating from the heart... and only skating for the love of it. And I believed you because you were my friend. But it was only gonna be for a little while. My family really needed the money. We all need the money, Brink. What's that have to do with it? [sighs] That's how it starts, you know? First, you do something that you really love... and then you start doing it for the money. And before you know it... you're just another sellout. Yo. Hey, Dad. What are you doing? Just, um... looking at my old skates. Why did you and Mom save all these? I don't know. Maybe we were planning on having another kid. Or maybe just because we're a couple of pack rats that never throw away anything. I remember when I got you these. You were four, maybe five years old. I figured, hell, I liked skating... maybe he will too. Of course... I didn't know it was going to take over your life. Me neither. How's Gabriella? Mom called Jordy's mother. You were racing? I didn't listen to you, Dad. I tried out for the sponsored team. But I told you no. We needed the money. Not so bad, buddy, that we needed you to disobey us. I know. I guess it wasn't just for the money either. I wanted to be a part of Team X-Bladz. I wanted to have my picture in every magazine. I wanted to be somebody. I don't know if you get that. You know, you and me... we're a lot alike. I used to love being construction foreman. "Hi. How ya doin'? I'm Ralph Brinker. I'm the construction foreman." I used to love saying that. People looked up to me. Then I got injured. Suddenly, no more construction foreman. You wanna know the worst part of being on disability? I didn't know who I was anymore. I used to define myself by my job title. But you want to know something? After being laid off for six months... I finally figured out... that "construction foreman" is what I do... not who I am. Andy. You are defined by the company you keep and how well you keep it. Not by what you just happen to do. Now, kids who skate, come on, California's filthy with 'em. But you... You are Andy Brinker. You are a good son. And you are a good friend. Who just happens to skate. And tomorrow, if you never skate again... you're still Andy Brinker. I... I understand there's gonna be a big tournament this weekend. Yeah. The A.A.I.S. Championship. Biggest national tournament there is. You gonna compete? No. I don't think so. Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I'd like to watch. -Really? -Yeah. Sounds like a lot of fun. [clears throat] Come on. Let's... split for the pad. [laughs] Come on, Dad. You and I both know that no one talks like that anymore. Did we just come dangerously close to having a conversation? [Brink chuckles] Yeah. -Don't tell Mom. -No. No sense in letting her get her hopes up. It's about time, man. Don't give me strawberry. Do I look like I'm wearing a dress? -I get chocolate. -Hey! I'm totally gonna pull a 720 flat spin at the championship-- Whoa! There's your skates! I'm through. I quit. There's your helmet. And I'd give you back your clothes too, but I actually, like, threw 'em in a garbage bin I saw across the street. This is about your little friend, isn't it? You put the gravel on the road. You realize you could've killed her? Man, you are such a wuss. I'm the one who should be mad at you. You didn't even have the brains to finish the race. Maybe not, but I do have the brains to finish this. [all] Oh! You are so dead! Hey! Not today, man, not today! Boomer. I didn't think you'd turn on me. That's your problem, man. You don't think. No, that's not it. You know what your problem is? You're just no fun to skate with. You got beef with me, then you take it up with me Sunday at the championship. Oh... We'll get it on, for sure. -You need more air. -More air? More air. And, you, Peter, what's up with that flat-spin 540? I've got a grandmother back in Lima. She can do a 540. What's with you today? If you got beef, why don't you come here and try it yourself? -Fine. -Hey, cut it out. You know you're not supposed to skate until the weekend. Peter, this is nuts. Gabriella can't practice. We only have three people. I mean, what's the point of even competing? Because it's fun. Now, let's quit complaining and skate. Ah! [groans] Peter! [groans] Oh, this is just great! I can't fix this. This is fine. Now we don't even have the right gear to compete. This is a joke. You guys ever think of getting a sponsor? Sponsors are no fun. Well, depends on the sponsor. Thanks, but we already have shirts. How about skates? I think I got the sizes right. These are new. You convinced the dog groomer to sponsor us? Well, actually, I'm kinda the sponsor. Kinda? Well, you see, I kinda got my pay in advance so I could get you guys some stuff. How far in advance? About four months. Yeah. Well, good luck on Sunday, okay? Well, hold on a sec. Did you really throw that vanilla shake in Val's face? Chocolate. How did it feel? It was cool and it was sweet! So... Um... Well, you see, what Peter's trying to say is that... Well... What are you doing on Sunday? [announcer 1] It's Zuma Beach, California, site of the third annual Aggressive Inline Skating Championship. Eric, what we've got here are the nation's top-ten teams going head-to-head in three events: street, vert, and downhill. Hey, check it out. ESPN. Oh, man, this is the big time. We've got every magazine covering this. We've got scouts from all the biggest companies watching. Hey, but that doesn't matter, right, guys? We're in this for the fun. We're Soul Skaters. -Soul Skaters. -Yeah, brothers. Oh, my gosh! It's Team Pup 'N' Suds! I heard about you guys. You guys get paid in Kibbles 'n Bits, right? [all laughing] Now, I want you guys to practice saying this. "Really, we tried, but we're just too lame. [fake crying] At least we had a good time." I think they like us. Let's get out of here. [announcer] In the championship format, each skater's run from street and vert counts toward the team total. The two top-scoring teams will select a skater for a head-to-head race in the downhill. Well, let's get right to the street competition. All right, Gabriella, show 'em what Soul-Skating's all about! She hasn't trained in four days. She's got nothing. Our first skater up, a virtual unknown, Gabriella DeLama, from Team Pup 'N' Suds. Well, coming in with a nice mute grab. One of the few girls out here. Skating all the way across the course. We don't know a whole lot about this team but beautiful top soul. Nice style on the mini ramp. -Yeah, Gabriella! -Yeah. And a great run so far from an unknown skater. Nice style there. The Liu Kang grab transfer. And a 540 upping the difficulty. She has time for one more trick with less than five seconds. A huge 540 Liu Kang grab. Excellent style. Solid first run. Yeah! [presenter] 93. Next up, Val Horrigan, Team X-Bladz. [announcer] Here stands the nation's top-ranked skater on the top-ranked team. Prepare to be dazzled. Val Horrigan going off. He does more big tricks than anyone else in the same amount of time. Huge unity all the way down the rail. Such a beautiful mixture of airs, grinds and spins. Nice consistency. Kicking out the 540. -[air horn blares] -Time's up! An incredible run. Probably the top one so far today. A 98! Exactly what he deserves. Next up, Andy Brinker. Team Pup 'N' Suds. Now, we've seen him skate before. He's not that well-known, but he always seems to do well in the competitions. Brink's the guy who's gonna definitely try to use the course a little bit differently than any of the other skaters. He's a very creative skater. Now coming up to the boardwalk. And Eric, this is what I was talking about, going into the mini ramp. Huge transfer backing it up with a huge gap all the way to the bank. Brink skating with tons of speed, setting up for a soul grind-- Yeah. Go Soul-Skaters. With falls like that, it is gonna be difficult to compete with the other skaters having such flawless runs here today. Brink losing his rhythm. He's got to put something together here to stay competitive. A nice royale all the way down the rail. And another royale into the mini ramp. Brink, able to come back in the groove, finishing with a nice mid vert. He looks slightly disappointed. A score of 89 for Brink. -Mom! Katie! -Yeah. Are you okay? That was a great run. Yeah, but I got worked on that fall. But it's okay. We'll make it up. Where's Dad? Don't worry, he'll be here. He got called to the construction site. Mr. Beckman wants to talk to him about something. Is that good? Well, we'll find out, huh? Hey. Can I give you some advice? Skate better. Skate better... Skate better! -Mom, skate better! -Well, there you are. All I have to do is skate better. -Skate better! -Come on. Let's go watch him skate better. ♪ And don't look white ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm not, smile ♪ ♪ But if I do then I know that You're sure to find it ♪ ♪ And hope that You'll always believe the same ♪ ♪ Speak your mind, say you're mine ♪ ♪ And we'll lead the way to find That I'm sorry... ♪ Come on, Peter!

With runs like this, Team Pup 'N' Suds is definitely the surprise here today. A score of 97 puts them in fourth place. Fourth place? That's all right, man, and besides, we got the vert coming up. You know we rule on the vert. And, Pete, man, I'm gonna need an awesome 540 out of you, okay? -You got it, bud. -You can do it! [announcer] The vert event is next. Team X-Bladz has the commanding lead. But there are many teams battling for second and a spot in the grueling downhill. -Hey. -Hi. Well? Oh, no, Ralph. They're gonna let you go? -I start again on Monday. -Oh, my gosh! That's great! I'm so happy! -Ow. -Don't you scare me like that. Okay. There he is. Go, Brink! -Team Pup 'N' Suds, you're up. -All right, Dad! Skating first is Andy "Brink" Brinker. Yeah, Brink! Now, he has some making up to do for that fall in the street run but starts it off with a nice, solid invert. Whoa, Brink's starting to get high in the air. A huge safety grab 540, well over head-high. Back-to-back 540s right into another 540 unnatural, spinning in the opposite direction. Now working the coping. With a run like this, Team Pup 'N' Suds could be today's wild card. A huge 900 two-and-half full spin. [air horn blares] -Yes! -An awesome run for Andy Brinker, and today's long-shot team, Team Pup 'N' Suds. Their chance to make it to the downhill slight, but possible. And with a score of a 98, it could happen. Yes! That's my boy! He was all over that ramp! Yeah! [presenter] Up next, Val Horrigan. Team X-Bladz. All right! Currently, Team X-Bladz is running away with yet another competition. Val Horrigan is very comfortable being in first place. And in typical form, the huge air. Mixing it up, getting very acrobatic. Val is one of those skaters so comfortable with the spins. -Great orientation on the half-pipe. -[air horn blares] Some difficult tricks but no coping tricks. And it's that lack of lip tricks that might have cost him a couple of points. He ends with still a high score. A 97. Another great run for Team Pup 'N' Suds, but it's not gonna be enough. If Ben Kelly from Team G-Force can even pull off a reasonable one, it's gonna be G-Force versus X-Bladz in the downhill. Kelly's been nailing it all day. It ain't over till it's over. Right, man? Well, that's it for us. And a great carving 540. Over-rotates and goes down hard. All the way to the flat bottom. And he's completely off the ramp, not moving, being tended right now by the medics. He rises to his feet. He's okay. Getting the support of the crowd. An unfortunate circumstance for Team G-Force. However, an opportunity for Team Pup 'N' Suds with one skater to go. -What? -Dad, we can win. -We can win now? -We can win. All right, Peter, man, not to put any pressure on you-- I know. -Come on, Peter. -All right, Petey. -All right. -You can do it. You're the man. [presenter] Next up, Peter Calhoun. [announcer] Peter Calhoun is going to need the run of all runs if he's gonna bring Team Pup 'N' Suds to the downhill race. Starting off with huge amplitude. Everything he does, he's gonna try to do well overhead. Back-to-back airs, good definition on the grabs, and a huge 720 but lands awfully low. With that low landing, he's gonna have to pull something incredible. Here comes the 540. There it is! There is the incredible trick, an inverted 540 which lands up high on the vert. One and a half full body rotations, completely upside down. Beautiful style. Peter Calhoun mixing it up with spins, huge airs. He could very well be bringing Team Pup 'N' Suds to the finals. -[presenter] 98! Team Pup 'N' Suds win! -[announcer]They have done it! What a great way to end the vert championships! Down to the last run. It's going to be one skater from Pup 'N' Suds versus one skater from X-Bladz on a treacherous downhill race. Winner takes all. What's up, everybody? Welcome to the Friendship Bell Downhill. This is the most dangerous course in competition today. Okay, guys, we did it. We came this far, and I'm not gonna let you guys down. Do you hear me? Just remember one thing. Win or lose, skating is what we do, not who we are. Man, that was, like, deep. Pup 'N' Suds, you guys have one minute. Okay, dude. This is it. Good luck. We'll see you at the bottom. All right, man. You know, before I just wanted to beat you. Now I'm gonna humiliate you. You ever hear that winning isn't everything? Oh, sure. Didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now. And neither do you. Yeah, I wanna win. But no matter what, win or lose, at the end of the day, I'm not you. So it's still a good day. [presenter] Skaters, to your marks. Get set. Go! ♪ You've got to know yourself ♪ Come on, buddy! You can do it! [announcer] Both skaters just flying down the course, neck and neck. This is the section in the course where the top speeds will be reached. Both totally in a tuck. Whoever can be the most aerodynamic is gonna start to pull away. Forty-two and a half miles per hour. That is a new course record. [cheering] ♪ You've got to know yourself ♪ Yeah! ♪ You've got to know yourself ♪ ♪ You've got to know yourself ♪ Go! My man, Val!

Get in close! [Brink] Dude, are you okay? [groans] Let's get you out of here. Come on, let's go. You never did have the brains to finish a race when someone was down. I guess not. That's what I was counting on. -Get it? -I got it all. Let's go. [announcer] As expected, Val Horrigan in the lead. A huge air out of the alley, coming out of nowhere, and they're back. My move! My move! Back to the neck-and-neck position they've had throughout the race. It's into the tucks. ♪ You've got to know yourself ♪ [announcer] This is it, a dead sprint. This is all heart. Both skaters totally exhausted. -Oh! -Yes! Team Pup 'N' Suds. They've done it! Team Pup 'N' Suds from behind grabs the championship! An incredible finish! Katie! -How does it feel? -It feels great, Dad! [crowd chanting] Pup 'N' Suds! Pup 'N' Suds! [man] You stink, man! You cheated! You're a cheater, man. Go, Brink! Hey. Hey, I didn't know Val would do something like that, man. -I'm sorry. -Yeah, man. Me neither. -It's okay. You guys didn't know. -Brink, we need to talk. Listen. Val, he's out.
