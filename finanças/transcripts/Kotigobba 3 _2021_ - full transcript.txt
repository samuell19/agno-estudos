Bengaluru's most notorious rowdy-sheeter Basheer bhai is back in news. Basheer is infamous for his wrongdoings and involvement in the Land Mafia, Homicide cases, Robberies, Betting scandals and extortions. Yet he's been evading the hands of the law. Addressing this issue, the Bengaluru City Police Commissioner ...is currently conducting a Press conference. It's being said that he has political backing and is being funded illegally. What do you have to say? He has robbed public's money. Sir, I have a doubt. Does Basheer have an informal agreement with the Police? Let me throw the question back at you. Does Basheer have an informal agreement with the Media? While we form teams to nab the criminal after ...gathering intel about his hideout and head to arrest him. What do you media guys do? BREAKING NEWS! "You heard it first from us!" You run headlines claiming, "Cops are on the way to nab the Criminal" And what does he do? He makes a getaway from there! Let me tell you this... In the next 24 hours, the notorious criminal Basheer, irrespective of where he's hiding, will be brought down to his knees and ...presented to all of you by our ACP troop. Are you saying you'll arrest Basheer Bhai in just 24 hours? We won't need twenty four hours. We'll arrest him in six. And if you don't? Even if it is at the cost of our inspector's life, we will arrest him. Why should I give my life for some random Basheer Bhai? Is that the appropriate place to keep your phone? Sir, this is my wife's phone. - That explains the ringtone! Dear, our child woke up with a nightmare. You're breathing fine, right? As long as this Son-of-a-pig Commissioner is alive... I can't breathe peacefully. Cut the damn call! Sir, I'll pray to your little man. Please save my wife from turning into a widow. What can I do? - Arrest Basheer Bhai somehow! What do you even know about Basheer Bhai and his area? Pickpockets, murderers and gangsters hangout to have a good time there. He lives in Sultanpalya! You're talking as if Sultanpalya is in Pakistan. We're the Police! Be it the Police or anyone else. If Basheer dislikes someone, they can't enter his area. Let me tell you why. Right from the oldies of Sultanpalya to the young lads, even the women of the area, are informers of Basheer. Whenever someone new enters the area... Hundreds of eyes spy on him and rat him out. Brother, a new guy has entered the area. Stop right there! Who are you? - I'm here to deliver food. Get the hell out of here! To put it in simple terms. His area is Bengaluru's Basheerstan! The Police Commissioner has claimed that in the next 24 hours, Basheer will be... "In the next 24 hours, the notorious criminal Basheer" "...irrespective of where he's hiding" What the hell does he think of Basheer Bhai?! This is my damn fortress! No man on this earth has the guts to step into my area. There is a guy! He's just like the blazing fire! He is the real man! He is equal to an army! He is a Master of Disguise! He metamorphoses as per his whim. Even if the wind can't make it in there... He will. Bhai, you think he can get past this sea of people and knock on your doors? Check who it is! Kaseem? - Yes brother? Do you see the cops? - No brother. There's no one. You.. check who it is. Salaam-Alaikum - What is it? Can I get some water? - What is it? He wants some water. - Give him. Wait here. I'll get it. Stop there. We'll get the water. Wait outside. Thank you son. There's no one here, Bhai. Bhai, let's get out of here. Stop hiding and retaliating, you coward! If you have the guts, come face us like a man! To all of those friends, family, eternal enemies and well-wishers ...who waited all this while for my arrival. Namaskara to you all! How are you guys?! Say what you want. The joy of speaking in one's own mother tongue is unmatchable! Who the hell are you?! Come here. Are you done? You clearly had the choicest of abuses for me, dear! I've learnt two things in life, my dear! First, is to not blabber over-the-top stuff! And the other thing is.. To not pay heed to those who blabber over-the-top things! It's your job to utter nonsenscial dialogues! It's my job to do the necessary deed! Feel free to blabber nonsense while I do the deed and move on! The public should talk about us, dear. We shouldn't. So you go ahead and... Look who's here! Salaam-Alaikum, Basheer Bhai! You're the Sultan of this locality! And you dropped like shit on the ground?! Were you snuggling up or tired? Looks like he was resting. I'll knock your teeth out! All those thrashes and there's still no dearth of pride. Take him away! Don't spare anyone. Take everyone away! Sir? Come here for a minute. What the hell happened to you? - Help me up, please! Watch my hand! Get up slowly! Careful. Can I have some water? - You'll only get alcohol in this area. Not water. Who beat you up? He did... - Who did?! Sir, I came here just like how you planned it. I saw Basheer and the cash. With great difficulty, I managed to hold him tight! He came right then! - Who was it? He battered me to the hilt! - And then? About the cash.. - What about the cash? He took it away sir! - Dammit! Who was it? - Shiva, sir! It was Shiva! Wait! Didn't Shiva die already?! Wasn't our Ex-ACP imprisoned for it? Hasn't he taken over his position? Then how the hell did Shiva appear? - He did, sir! He came over and thrashed me without caring for his own brother! Look what he's done to me! - Continue your act with him! Take a look at what he's done! - Get away you clown! Sir, ask him for the cash! Well, the cash went jinta-tah! Wait! Why does this sound familiar?! A flash from his past! A movie from his own banner! Yep! That one! I'll get to the point! You paid me to handle ten men, right? When I arrived, there were thirty. You paid for ten, the remaining payment... Wash that filthy mouth of yours with phenyl! First you claim it was Shiva's work. Why should we pay you then? You can't get your job done and then turn the tables! This is wrong! You're the protectors of law! Don't harass the needy! God is watching and won't let this go! Please get the balance money transferred to my account. Money is extremely necessary. Please? He has whipped this poor man left and right! Please don't spare him! Sir, I'll take your leave. Please don't forget the money. Look how he beat the living hell out of me! Sir? What an extraordinary performer! I'll make some calls and ensure that he gets a State award! State awards won't cut it. It has to be a National award. So be it. Don't you think he's trying to put up an act?! He's not trying to put up an act. He has already pulled it off! What?! Then why did you let him go? The money was unaccounted for. It is better that he has it, than us. Sir? The money will only help better the lives of many. It won't go into his pockets. He's a player. Not a fraud. Sathya! Go on! Ask him. Brother! The thing is... Quick! Now! You go ahead. Let him ask. Don't disturb him. Will you do it or not? - What is it, boys? Brother, you got everyone a Deepavali gift. What about us? What do you want? Well, apparently Chameli has come to our hangout place. Chameli's here?! Hey, hello! Dear butterfly! All of your body is fluttering in style Fret not, if we end up brushing against each other, we're sorry! Sorry!

All of your body is fluttering in style Fret not, if we end up brushing against each other, sorry. Sorry Ask for the moon, and I shall have it by your feet You're a potent stimulant, who's enough, and it’s time to bid booze, goodbye Why should you be the chosen one I fall for, among them all? How far will you come looking for me? I shall walk into your dreams; even into your heart Let’s tell a story that will get the town eating each other’s heart out What a cracker of a lass!

Don't ask me what I'm doing sitting here. Oh! I won't ask. If you don't ask, how will I tell you? How will you? - Exactly. Are you that dumb?! Sorry. I didn't realise. What is madam doing here? What else will I be dwelling on, other than about you? Tell me. What about me is bothering you so much? How long will this go on? I'm tired. Oh damn! I decided to take up your responsibility because ...you're taking care of me as I have no one else. And you're taking complete advantage of me! Am I? How exactly am I taking advantage of you? Look son! I'm not the outdated type. To force you into a marriage. Even then, isn't it my responsibility to find you a good gal? But Jaanu, when you're here... - Don't get started with the same tale! But Jaanu, listen to me... - It's of no use talking to you. Jaanu?! Jaanu! Listen to me! Son, say another word and... What if I do?! What will you do about it? What will you do if I say another word? Jaanu! Enough acting. Wake up Jaanu. Enough with the act. Get up! One shouldn't lie down on the floor. Get up. Jaanu?! Jaanu! Sathya, I know it's hard for you. The kid is suffering from Brugada syndrome. It's a genetic cardio-vascular disorder. What should we do doctor? There is a way out, in Poland. There's an Indian doctor who's an expert in handling such cases. You must visit him. But it's going to be very expensive. Sathya? What's wrong with me? Will I also die like my parents? Tell me Sathya. If you gorge on Bisibelebath and play all day without resting. What else do you think will happen? From now on, you'll rest after eating before going out to play. Got it? You think I'll let something happen to you? Will I let it happen? Close your eyes and sleep now. Siddharth Shukla, my lead scientist. Dad, he's now in the final stage of the disease. If he's not given the antidote in two days, his survival will be difficult. Devendra, please let me go. How do I let go of someone who's been with me for twenty five years? DEV PHARMA. We built this empire, by killing so many people. I'm the muzzle. And you're the brain. It was very much understood that it was a 70-30 deal in this business. Between the two of us. The medicinal formula you invented... You refused to share it with me. With no other go... We injected the virus into you. You know better than me. How this virus works on human body. Why aren't you handing over the formula for my project? Why Mr. Siddharth? You are targetting the women and children. This won't end well for our society. Human Population is the biggest crisis in this world. With this virus, I'm controlling it. I am the merchant of death, Mr. Siddharth. But, I'm purely a businessman. Cause and Cure. I create them both. Don't push me to do the unthinkable. Sasha! Micheal... - Yes boss? What's the status with the crown jewel? We bought it in the auction. As per normal procedure, it has been stationed at the ...Air-force Museum and it will reach us in a week. David and team is taking care of it. What happened to our Indian project? Your Indian partner is handling and I'm just following it up. We're done with the check-up of your child. The reports will be ready in sometime. The doctor will call you once he's ready for the consultation. He will explain the procedures going forward. No problem, right? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. The doctor told me that our trip here was a waste of time. What do we do now? You tell me. Shall we go to the museum nearby? - Okay. I'll go for some wee-wee. Will you wait here? No problem, right? - Nope. Sit tight and I'll be back. - Okay. [OVERHEAD PAGING] Mr. Sathya? Are you Mr. Sathya? I've got the reports. The doctor is calling for you. Could you follow me please? Okay. I'll be back. Hello! - Hi! Are you from India? - Yes. I'm from Bengaluru. Really? What's your name? - I'm Jaanu, and you are? I'm Priya. Why are you here? What happened? It's for a check-up. So my son and I have come here. Son? - Yep. My son, Sathya. What do you mean by your son? Sathya has no family. Neither do I. Sathya is family to so many kids like me. Sathya takes care of everyone with love and I lovingly take care of him. That is why he addresses me as, "Amma". That makes him my son, right? Okay. Where is your son? Do you want to meet him? - I really have to. Priya, look how you want to meet him right after hearing about him. That is my Sathya. I'll finish my rounds and will definitely meet him. Okay? Sathya has gone to get the reports. And once he's back, we're flying away to India. You think I'll let a cutipie like you to fly away just like that? I'm going to Bengaluru next week. Let's go together, okay? I'll speak with the doctor about your case and I'll take care of it. Your name's Jaanu, right? And your son's Sathya? Yep. - Done. Be here okay? I'll see you. Bye. - Bye. Didn't I tell you all this was for nothing? There's only one check up to go. Let's get it done, okay? What do we do until then? Didn't you mention about going to a museum? You're right! I need all the details of the incident. It's an emergency sir! Blast in the northern part of the city? - Yes sir. Any casualties? - Ten are already dead. But they're not civilians. - All of them are criminals. Let's go. Our guys have shut down the security system. Let's move in! [ANNOUNCEMENT OVER WALKIE] One more blast in the city. Over. Any casualties? - Many victims have died in the blast. Let's move. If any of you step over line, we won't hesitate to shoot. No need to panic. We'll be out of here in ten minutes. Ghost, level two security has been shut now. You can move in. Ghost, all the security systems have been disabled, you can move in. There's been another blast in the east side of the city. Over. Tom, is there a big transaction of money or anything valuable ...happening at this moment in the city? The Crown Jewel auction. Happened a week ago. It's worth 750 Million Euros. An Indian billionaire Devendra bought it in the auction. The Crown Jewel is being kept in the Airport Museum right now. I think it'll be delivered to him in a week. Then it's him. - Who is it, sir? GHOST. - Who do you mean? I miss the connection sir. This is his Modus Operandi. He's diverting us while he's still in the museum. If I'm right, there will be another blast. Alert all the teams to be ready for the Museum. All teams stand by to go to the Museum. Twenty days to breach the security system and destroy the vault. But all we are getting are peanuts for our work. Why does he get to take everything? Because he planned everything and has the password to the case of the Crown Jewel. No worries. Let him get the Crown Jewel. We'll trap Ghost, trap him and escape from here. [INTERCOM]There's been another blast. Over. Now I'm sure it's him. He's definitely heading for the jewel. All teams head to the museum. Now! Don't you dare cheat us! Ghost! That's him! Keep going! Get him! Go faster! Drive faster, Tom! Tom, Go! We all know there's been four blasts in the city. This is a serious matter. We don’t know who has done this, but our suspicion lies on one man. His name is Ghost. We've been searching him for the past four years and he... Hello Kangana. Team, meet Kangana. She's our top most criminal profiling analysis officer. She's the best in the business. Kangana, you know everything about that has happened. Four blasts took place. The 750 Million euros' Crown Jewel was robbed by the Ghost ...with the help of seven thieves who were later trapped. I want you to profile him because nobody knows anything about him. I want more information on him. Sure sir. I'll do my best. We've formed a special team to investigate this case. Mr. Sharath from the Interpol is handling this case. Tom from the local police department will be assisting him. Since we all know what happened, let's just get straight to the questions. Yes? We've got four blasts, forty criminals dead, a robbery of a Crown Jewel worth 750 Million euros and seven thieves have been arrested. You say all of this has been done by one man named Ghost? Yes. - And nobody knows anything about him? Is this a joke? Do you really want us to believe all that? Do I look like I'm joking? I've only told you what's happened. Sir? - Go on. If this was really done by one man named Ghost, then tomorrow's headline is going to be this... "IS GHOST A HERO OR A VILLAIN?" Well, if you want to project him as a hero, that is your prerogative. For me, he's a criminal. He might have escaped for now, but I will catch him. Jaanu! - Hey, Priya! I asked about your case in the hospital. They told me that you've fixed the appointment for next month and left for Bengaluru. How could you leave without telling me? Did you land now? But what are you doing here? - I came to meet you. Enough of your fairy tale. Who do you have here? Hello Priya. Grandpa! - How are you my dear? I'm doing good. Hello Grandma! Hope you're doing well, my dear. Why? Isn't it good? Yuck! It's disgusting! Whose child is it? It's mine! - Huh? She'd come to our hospital for treatment. I got worried for a second. - Where's your son? Over there! Greetings. Doctor, what are you doing here? How do you know that I'm a Doctor? Have we met before? Where did you see me? You didn't introduce me to them. I'm her Grandfather. - They're my Grandparents. Greetings to you both! Whenever Sathya meets any elders, he touches their feet to seek blessings. Why are you hesitating Sathya? Go for it! Wait.. What? Greetings to both of you! - Please get up. Your son's awesome. I know. You have my permission to love him. Go ahead! Sir, you didn't introduce me to him. - He's my Nephew, Sundar. Hello sir! [MUMBLES] He's only a little better looking than me. He's just okay. I'll take your leave sir. - Take care. God bless. Shall we leave? - He's dashing! If you won't mind, can I say something? You should always be smiling. You have a beautiful smile. It'll energise us all. Bye Priya. - Bye. I will not spare you! Sathya! You are my prey! What did you say? Sathya.. - It was something else. Go on. Sathya, is my prey! Give it to me. Sathya is mine! Nobody other than me gets to touch him! Do you know who I am? I'm Kishore! ACP Kishore. Why did you get in here? You murdered someone and got in. Why did you come in? You raped someone and got in. This guy here - The King of Sultanpalya. Why did you get in here? You were a criminal and got in. But why did I come here? I did no wrong and yet I'm here, sitting like a criminal ...in between all of you, all because of Sathya. He is mine! Sathya is MY PREY! Among us today, we have an esteemed personality whose presence ...has brought this noble event immense dignity. Considering the orphans of this world as his own, ...our esteemed guest has built an orphanage at his own expenses ...and is also extending free medical care to the needy. We heartily welcome Sri Raja Ranganath Aras to our event. Today, we shall felicitate a host of selfless personalities in Karnataka, ...who like our Guest Sri Raja Ranganath Aras, ...are carrying out various forms of social work. Let's begin by welcoming Mr. Sathya who heads the 'MOTHER'S HOME' institution. Just because Mr. Ranganath has helped a couple of people, ...it doesn't make him a great social worker. All of this is just to create a political image. Nothing more. Let's go up there. But why sir? - I'll tell you that in a while. Can I have the mic? Greetings sir. Greetings everyone. This friend of mine here, is Mr. Ramesh. I'll tell you how I go to know your name in a while. Let me tell you why I got him here. Sir, you were saying something from there. I'll give you the mic now. Feel free to say it out loud so that everyone can know what you said. Here's the mic. Sir is getting nervous... Come forward. He seems to be getting nervous. Let me tell you. What he said while sitting there was... Just because Mr. Raja Ranganath has looked after a mere fifty or a hundred children... It doesn't make him a big leader. He believes that all of this is an act because election is nearing. I'll tell you all a story. A woman... Gives birth to a baby. Before she gives birth, her husband who was in the Army, breathes his last. For days and nights, she took the uphill battle to bring him up, nurture and educate him. She even got him married. You might have heard of such stories before. Now comes the interesting point. The man grew up, got married and right after tying the knots, The first thing he did was... To abandon and desert the very mother who gave him a life, on the streets. The mother's no one, but a woman named Paravathamma. Her son... is Ramesh. Parvathamma is at my old age home. My inspiration is nobody but him. Yet, you think you can pass comments on him? Right? It is your duty to look after your mother. Mr. Raja Ranganath is serving the society. Sir? Not just his words. No matter what anyone has to say, we shall not believe it. You are no less than a God to me. Piri... Piri, tell me how my dress looks on me? It's horrible! Makes me want to puke! Piri? Since a week, wherever you go, I've been your driver and bodyguard. Tell me why? Who am I, Priya? Tell me who I am... - You're a loafer! A hobo and a useless jackass! Does that monkey-like-face of yours even deserve to be loved? It's better for the girl to kill herself by jumping on the tracks of a Metro train. You disgusting prick! I'll tell your mother, wait... It's not about you. Come, let's go. Piri, let me ask you one thing directly. I have been watching you all week. You go wherever Sathya goes. All you do is talk is about Sathya. What does all of this mean? It's true love, you bastard! If possible, help them. Else I'll stab you right in the guts. Who the hell are you? I'm on call, sir. I'm scolding a friend. Poor man! Almost peed his pants. Apparently, it's a friend. Dude, there's a guy who's acting just like you. A dimwit! - You are a dimwit! Your father is another dimwit! Sorry Piri. He was... Excuse me? Hi, Sathya. Hey, how are you? What are you doing here? Didn't expect to see you here. I was expecting you though. - You were? My horoscope predictions for today claimed that my Dream Girl ...would meet me, and lo behold, you're right here. Brother! - How nice. Everything's ready as per the plan. Who is this new talent? What did he mean by that? Do you see that person in blue dress? Her name is Rithu. Do you see the guy next to her? They both are madly in love. We are here to break it. What? What you're witnessing here is far from the actual reality. Every father wishes for his daughter to be happy no matter where she is. Rithu, my daughter. She is in love with a man. Despite knowing that the man's a fraud... How do I hand my dear daughter over to him? Considering the position I am in, I am capable of screwing that guy. But if my daughter learns that he suffered because of me... I'm worried that I'll lose my daughter forever. She hardly speaks to me. She doesn't even call me. I'm not asking you to save my reputation as a father. I'm begging you to save my daughter. Your daughter will come home, sir. A thorn can only be removed with another sharp object. A fraud can be exposed only by fooling him. What a player! Hello! - Hey. That man walking over there in the black jacket, do you know him? I think I saw him here. Yes, he's my friend. - I think he dropped his phone. Thank you. Rithu! Rithu? Listen to me! I'm sorry, Rithu. Please listen to me. Don't ever come back into my life. Go to hell! Hello Dad? - Rithu? I'm extremely sorry. I didn't listen to you and committed a mistake. Forgive me. I'm coming home now. Please come back. Sathya... My daughter spoke to me. I don't know how to thank you. Thank you very much! Your daughter will be home in a while. Be happy with her. Neither did you call me, nor did I answer your call. I don't know you and neither do you know me. Let's forget all of this. It's wrong to eavesdrop. It's wrong! Are we getting anything from the CCTV visuals of the Museum? Hopefully we will. I think he's whispering something. Is this camera audio enabled? Can you check that? Yes. It is audio enabled. Play it for me. It's a Sanskrit Mantra. Got it. Guys, can we face map all the Indians or Asians who entered the Museum? Also use the ID documents provided in the Museum. Okay. Doing that. Can we get the details of this guy entering the country? Coming up. You came down a week ago and planned everything to steal the Crown Jewel. This could be our guy. - You sure? This isn't concrete evidence. But technically, it is substantial evidence. Tom? - Yes? File all the evidence with the Indian embassy and the local police. So that they can start their proceedings before we leave to India. Yes, will do sir. Mr. Ranganath, we've received information that your life is in danger. Don't worry. Rahul, increase the security. Guys, shut all the doors! Unit one, come inside. Quick. Unit two?! While we think we're a step ahead, he's ten moves ahead of us. He has finished everything even before we could get here. He's so close to the police officers. You went to the Ashrama, right? What did you learn? I did go the Ashrama with the Mantra recited by Ghost at the Museum vault. When I went there, I learnt that it was one of ...the best neurogenic treatment centres in India. When I asked the Guru at the Center, he explained to me that... This Mantra is powerful enough to heal nerve damages. 25 years ago, they had cured a young boy with the same Mantra. His name... is Shivabodhi. When I asked for Shivabodhi's details... He told me that when the boy was ten, his uncle took him home. Sir, I've asked the local officer to collect his details. But the interesting thing is this... Not a single case has been registered against Sathya. The ACP however is in the jail for having killed Shiva, who looked like Sathya. The ACP surely has all the information about Shiva and Sathya. If Shiva alias Shivabodhi is dead, could Sathya be the Ghost? I'm viewing this case from another perspective. As per the latest information I received, All of those who died on the day of the Museum robbery, worked for Raja Ranganath. Now he also is dead. That means the Ghost has killed everyone. The gangsters and Raja Ranganatha Aras seem like small players. The mastermind however, is somewhere else. If I'm not wrong, Ghost has just begun his game. What could the mastermind be up to now? The Crown Jewel has been stolen by a man named Ghost. In the bomb blasts that took place in Poland. Our Gang members, drug and organ traffickers have all died. Why didn't you tell me this before? These activities were being handled by David ..and your Indian partner, Raja Ranganatha Aras. The Ghost has killed Raja Ranganatha Aras too. Sir, we tried informing you but you were too busy. Take him away. This dynasty was built thirty years ago over hundreds of bodies. Today, a man named Ghost is trying pluck out the leaves, break the branches, destroy the trunk, and now wants to uproot us completely. We can't afford to get scared. We've to scare the wits out of him! Jeet, I want to know who Ghost it. We have our informer in the Interpol. Whatever information they learn, will reach us too. Either you should've fallen in love with yourself or with someone else. Only then does one take selfies and go bonkers. What now? Are you in love? Is it the fish market Meenakshi? Who else will dare fall for you? Stop it! Oh wait. Is it the third standard teacher, Jyothi? Come on Jaanu! Are you telling me or not? I don't have any time to waste. I'll tell you, wait. - Tell me then. Okay. It's Priya. All this drama just to tell me this? She also loves you, right? Why does my heart only want you? What is so special about you, lad? You’re no ordinary guy and I tell this with all my heart You really are one in a Crore I shall adore and admire you Of late, I stand still on the streets, oblivious to the world I wink at myself, looking in the mirror Have I really fallen in love? You’re the reason my eyes glimmer more You’re the one who embraced me in my fantasies You’re no ordinary guy and I tell you this while I blush You really are one in a Crore I shall wait all along for you With intimacy brewing between us as we grow closer The light of youthfulness has been ignited All this euphoria has now taught me to waltz Your affection is addictive You’re the one, who brushed your finger on to mine Embrace me now, I shall nibble your ear and tell that you that You really are one in a Crore I shall do all I can to woo you Sathya isn't that kind of a person. Although this man looks like Sathya, There's no way he could have committed murders and a robbery of that scale. Well then, if this isn't Sathya, who is it? There's a chance this could be Shiva, who looks like Sathya. This is Shiva's medical report. Isn't that your signature? Yes. - The doctor's signature is there too. This is Shiva's post-mortem report. A police officer who killed Shiva has been punished too. With all these evidence, we can confirm that Shiva's dead. If you don't mind, can you please wait outside? I have another interrogation to conduct. Excuse me, sir. This is Kishore. Good Morning sir. - You can go. Sit. I wonder why I never got such assistants. Excuse me. Can I have a cigarette please? Smoking is injurious to health. We're from the Interpol - Oh. Is it? What do you know about Sathya? Sathya? They would've got permissions right from the Central to State Government authorities. It is our duty to co-operate with all their investigations. He went for the Calf first and then the Ox. Looks like he got to the humans too. Sir, when he made his first kill locally, I warned everyone. Nobody cared to listen. All I did was warn and they locked me up. Look how he hit the entire department right where it hurts. Sir, aren't you from an International agency? He's an International fraudster. I know all of his tricks. Sir? There aren't two of them. There's only one. Sir, believe me. If you let him go now, you'll never be able to catch him. If I'm not wrong, he's already planning his next heist. Before the unthinkable happens, go stop him. Don't let him go. His name's Sathya. He's basically from... When you already know who the enemy is, why bother telling me the details? Micheal, finish him. Baby, he's a criminal. Interpol hasn't confirmed yet. The investigation is still on. It's good to wait a little. Are we into social service to check for credibility? Once you doubt someone to be your enemy, undoubtedly our next move is to finish him. So Micheal, kill him. Thank you. Please sit down. I'll have a coffee too. - This one's actually for you. Wait, no. - No, really. I'll order another one. Okay. You wanted to tell me something. You go first. Go on. You first. And then I'll tell you. Go on. Let me help you. Tell me. - Thank you. Has Sathya arrived? - He has, brother. Call me once you finish him. - Sure. What happened? Sure. - I'll be back in a moment. Brother? - Is the job done? I've sent the boys. Once we finish him, I'll call you. Hello? Who have you sent us to mess with? He's no ordinary man. He's bashing the living lights out of our men. What the hell are you saying? Hello? Tell me what's happening, goddammit! Freeze! Don't move! Put your hands on your head! Get down! - Inspector, I am... I said get down. Arrest him. Have it? Where do we start from? If I ended up doubting myself after looking at the photos and videos, ..there's nothing wrong in you suspecting me. This isn't me. That is all I can say. I did go to the Museum with the kid for real. But I had nothing to do with the robbery. I worshipped Raja Ranganath like a God. Why would I kill him? He looks exactly like me. Trust me. He looks like me and is trying to bait me. It wasn't me. I see. Who is it then? Shiva? That is not Shiva. It's neither Shiva, nor Sathya. Then who? Sundara? Sathyam, Shivam, Sundaram. It's a good movie title. Even I have no clue who he is. If you don't mind, if you're not having your coffee. May I? Madam, Priya's here. - Okay. I hope you realise you've no choice but to tell the truth. So make it easy for yourself. Make it easy for us. Or else, we know how to make it easy for ourselves. Sir, I'm telling you. It's not me, it's someone who looks like me. I'm not talking about an ordinary pick-pocketing or chain snatching case! I'm talking about big heists and murders. So don't think of playing games with me. 'Coz I won't hesitate for a second to put a bullet ...into your brains to get the truth out of you! So, Priya? Is he the one you fell in love with? I fell for him thinking he's a good man. But I had no idea that he was a killer or a thief. I feel sick about myself for doing this. Jaanu too is naive like me. Without knowing his true colours, she believes he's a good man. Why should Jaanu suffer for his mistakes? Can I have my ID and Passport back, please? I'll leave this country and take Jaanu along with me. I won't be in the same place as him even for a moment. I've been waiting for this day since a long time. You fooled me, got me thrown out of my job and made me a prisoner too. I shall recover every day of my share that I've lost with additional interest! Let him go! Stop! Take your hands off him! Get your hands off him! Sir, you're right. Your prediction has come true. Shut your traps and stay quiet! Try pulling off an act and I'll throw you in the underground cell. Let's go. Lock the cell. You got lucky that they came. Or else I would've buried you right here. From being a local no one, you're looking to go International, is it? Sathya and Shiva aren't two but the same man. I've been saying this from then. I'll tell the same thing now, even until I die, I shall scream the same thing. I'm in no mood to watch your skit, and I've no interest in debating you. Don't get into trouble with me. Get into trouble?! You're the one in trouble now! Do you know where you are? Everyone here are from my clan. This is my area. This is Kishore's fortress! You might believe that both Sathya and Shiva are me. But there's a third guy, and I saw it through my own eyes. Dammit! Your performance is out of the world! Two minutes is all it took you to fool me all over again! No Filmfare or National award will suffice for you, you need the freaking Oscar! Sir, please save me! If I'm with him, I'll lose my mind and go mental. He's blabbering random stuff! Please come and save me! Can't you hear me crying for my life?! Staying with him is torturous! I can't do it. I'll lose my mind. Sir, I have something to tell the officer. Sir, Sathya has something to tell you. What happened? Did he confess to his crime? Sir, what are you doing? Sir? Why did you bring me here again? Sathya confessed to everything. - What did he confess to, sir? I was the one who headed all the killings and robbery. What's the reason for confessing all of a sudden? It's okay to ask that question if I don't accept the crime, not the other way. Finally, he accepted his mistakes! At last, do you accept that I was telling the truth? I'm a definite man. I was shouting my lungs out ...that he was pulling off the double act but nobody believed me. Madam, he's no ordinary guy. He's a great actor. For two minutes I got fooled, he ended up convincing me too. He's a Superstar. A Baadshah. A great act... Sir, why are you staring at me? Because he told us another truth too. What truth is that, sir? I might've been a part of everything. But the real brain behind it is someone else. I've no idea where the loot is either. I was carrying out the plan. He was the one making it. Who exactly did he refer to, sir? My partner. He has a partner? The very person who's now my partner in the cell, ex-ACP Kishore. Me?! His damn partner? He got us all fooled again. Don't trust him. Listen to me. He's aiming for something huge. Madam, please tell sir to listen to me. Madam, please tell sir! The Commissioner confidently gave a statement ...that you could not have done any of this. But you've confessed to everything. I am finding it difficult to believe that you were behind all of this. I too am finding it difficult. If I have to get him, I have no other way. You are both Shiva and Sathya. But neither Shiva nor Sathya did it. Then who else was it? He really does exist. To find out who he is and why he's doing this, To put an end to all of this, I have to face him eye-to-eye. We shall meet soon. Boss? What is it? Why do you seem pissed off? Did I just get promoted to rejoice and dance? We're only being shifted from Parappana Agrahara to a Polish prison. Three more months, and I would've been freed. You got me entangled in this mess and... Wait.. What's on your mind? Something is on. Tell me what it is! Let's find Ghost and then have this conversation? Then who are you, Sire? Look, try your tricks on them, not on me. If you try messing with me... You'll know then. Wait up... Why did you address me as Boss? Sir! I have nothing to do with this guy! He's calling me that for no reason. My life is ruined because of him. Let it go, boss. Why worry so much? Chill out. They shouldn't know that you're the boss, right? He's not my boss. - Sir?! Don't trust him, he's a fraudster! Welcome and Congratulations! Thanks Tom. They're yours now. Good. Priya, you've got Jaanu admitted at the right time. Her vitals are good. We can operate her in the next three-four days. You'll be all right, okay? Thank you, Dean. This child is now my responsibility. Priya, meet me outside for a second. Sir? - Yeah, Priya... Four days ago, Polish cops had come to the hospital. They enquired about you and a guy named Sathya. We told them whatever we knew about you. What's happening, Priya? Who is Sathya? He was a passing cloud in my life. His chapter in my life is over. He is the Ghost. He's an international criminal. The Interpol has arrested him. I trusted him. But he cheated everyone. No one was spared. Please don't ask me about him. Cool down, Baby. I feel like I took the vows with you and that we're going on a honeymoon. Even a wife wouldn't be this clingy. What's up fatso? Redskin? Look at that tummy you've grown. How much do you gorge on every day, you whale? He speaks Kannada! - WHAT?! Do you speak Kannada? If he did, wouldn't he have beaten the shit out of you by now? If I'd learnt to shut up, I would've been released in three months. I brought this upon myself. Ask anything and you'll have a smirk ready on the side, right? I know there are many who are fans of your smirk. But tell me why you smirked right at this moment? Any problem? Yes. There is a problem. If sire has a smirk on his face, there are hundred meanings to it. Also that a problem is approaching us. What is he showing? Is all of this your plan? Can you keep quiet for a minute? Wait! What are you doing?! Baby? Ghost and his boss were being taken to the jail by the police. But they managed to escape. What's happening? Where are we? Where are you taking me? If he helped us get away and made us come here. He must have set something up here. He gets caught over there. But escapes here in Poland. What is he aiming for? What is his plan? You've planned all of this and claim that someone else... Will you shut your trap?! Look. - Well, I'm looking. It's written in Kannada down there. So what? Who the hell will write Kannada in Poland?! What a shame to our department! Where did we go wrong? Where did they escape to? Sir, if my guess is right, Ghost will try to contact Priya. So what are we waiting for? Track and get both of them! There's a bag?! Clothes?! Money too?! We left something incomplete in the past and it has come back to haunt us. Jeet? Get our informers to track this guy. Wait, there's a map too. Guys, wait here. Thanks Marina. Priya? We've a bad news to tell you. Ghost and his boss have escaped. - What? We believe he'll definitely come to see you. I have to assign an Interpol team with you 24 hours a day, for your safety. Is she the Ghost's lover? No. Who's this guy? He's a security officer and he'll be here for your protection. Is this man, my bodyguard? Don't underestimate me. One doesn't need a good height or weight to become a bodyguard. DNS? Stop it! Priya, keep this buzzer with you. Press this and our team will be there for you anytime. So, you don't have to worry about the Ghost. Okay. Well, it's a hospital. You acted as if you were pursuing something big. You saw me find it too, right? Shut your trap! You're the Emperor of Acting! You've given such spectacular performances before. This one's no big deal for you. What now?! - I'm waiting for your next performance. Don't you dare tell me that you had no idea about that. I'll lose it! You've got me to the damn hospital and... Look at you gathering all the information at your fingertips. You should've been in the police department. What will you take to shut your mouth?! Just because I've escaped with you like a criminal, don't treat me like one. I'm a Cop. I'm from the damn police! God, I better escape. Miss Priya, our people are following every move of yours. Do you know who this guy is? - A doctor? Nope. He's an officer from our team. Do you know that guy sitting over there? A patient? - Nope. He's one of us. Do you know the guy mopping? Why don't you tell me? He's not a sweeper. He's one of us. By the way, do you know who these smart ladies sitting here are? Receptionists. But from your team. Not at all. We've let those two remain. To confuse the others. Just like how you got confused. I try so hard not to think of you, yet I see you everywhere. Is this a dream? If it was really a dream, he has to be in yours, and you have to be in his. Am I also not here? Like a jarring intermission? Will you please pipe it down? Priya, actually... - No. Don't come near me. If I press this buzzer, the police will come here. As if you weren't enough trouble, you got your boss too, is it? Boss?! - You mean this thing here? Thing?! You didn't treat me as a cop when I was one ...and you think you can treat me like a property now? You can't talk to me like that. - Just shut up. Look Priya... - Priya, I don't know anything. I'm not the guy you think I am. This was your next line, right? Go on. What will you take to shut up? Can't you see, I'm talking? What the hell are you talking? - Give me my chance to talk.. Enough talking! - Let me talk! This is my last warning to you! Shut up! You're still not letting go of your barbarism. You've found the right match. Answer her. When will you learn to shut up?! Priya, listen... Popular belief is that the cops arrive late to the scene. And here I am, even before the buzzer was pressed. Please don't shoot! If I breathe my last, it has to be ...in Karnataka, which gave me my bread and butter. What a wimp! - Ghost! What happened was... I'm a big fan of yours. Can I have a selfie, please? My selfie? - Please sir. Who made this guy a cop? Let him come close to us. A selfie? Please come. - Come close to us and stand! Take it. You also join us. - It's okay. Take it. My God! Don't touch me. I'm also a police officer man. Don't do this! You'll regret... Stop. Listen to me! Look at the daring cop on the ground! Excuse me?! I'm out of touch, bro! - Move it now. What happened? Was the Ghost here? He got away as usual. I feel dejected, madam. One selfie was all I needed. He kicked me and got away. Your selfie madness let the Ghost get away. Come on, madam. You and Sharath sir have let him get away so many times. That doesn't count. But I have to get him in my first try. How is this fair? Stop this nonsense. If he comes back... - [UNISON] He will come back for sure. If he does, don't use the buzzer. Give me your phone. I've attached a tracker. Just press it. Next time he's here, keep him engaged. We'll definitely be there in a few minutes and nab him. He came to the hospital, beat our officers up and got away. We have to find out what or who his next target is. Sir, as you instructed, we dug deep and found some information on those incidents. All those incidents were done by the Ghost. They are all connected directly or indirectly ...to the Indian billionaire, Devendra. He might be his next target. To conclude, the project will go live in the next two days. We have the antidote, gentlemen. Let's spread the virus all over the world. This is going to be our big business. Dad? - Let's just do it, Gentlemen. Interpol officer Sharath is here to meet you. Mr. Sharath, Interpol officer. Take your seat. So tell me officer, what brings you here? I'll just come straight to the point. Your Personal assistant has been murdered and the Ghost is the culprit. The most important point is that the Ghost's crimes ...are all related to you and your companies. Be it the Museum robbery or your PA's murder. He's been targetting you and your people. I want to know why. I should be asking you this question. Why me, officer? Why my companies? I have no enemies. Who is this Ghost even? Shouldn't you be finding out all these things? Why are you questioning me, officer? I asked the details for your own safety. Let me give you a piece of advice. Ghost never misses his targets. Have a nice time, Mr. Dev. Let peace prevail everywhere. Your protection can end here, please behave. Okay. I have to take the beatings there and the scolding here. What? Are you unlocking the phone? Go on. You're an expert at locking and unlocking things, aren't you? Do it. Turn on the television and all they're talking is about you. What are you doing here? - Priya... So, is this what you meant back then? Not just that. Everything is courtesy of Sir. Story-Screenplay-Dialogue-Direction. God knows what more he can do. [NEWS] Was the Ghost and his boss behind this explosion? If yes, the next target could be Dev Group of companies. The Police Department are have put out... Weren't you with me all along? When did you do all of this? When did I do any of it? Shut up and... I don't know if I'll ever make it back to my country. Priya, listen to me. You explain this to the police. Not to me. How did you make the blast happen while you were here? He is capable of it, sir. He can do it all! I was with him all along, and I couldn't figure out. How will you poor guys know? Will you shut up? What happened after we landed in Poland? The police took us. - How did they take us? In the van. - What happened after that? We escaped. - Where did we go to? To the hospital. - And where did we go after the hospital? We came here. Right? That means there's another guy like you. You're right, sir. - A double role, you mean? I'm unable to bear with him. Now there are two of them? Priya, I'll tell you what happened. If you're not him, why did the Chief Surgeon try to stab you? The Chief Surgeon? - Yeah. Let me tell you what happened. Relax. I'm just a doctor. I have nothing to do with the Interpol. I'm trying to help you out. Please come inside. I'm Dr. Ananth Krishnan, the Chief Surgeon. Close the door. That is just a sedative. I'm only trying to help you. Try to understand. Please? What is it? - It's just a sedative. Good. Shit. Sathya? I... How do you know my name? Doctor, how do you know my name? Tell me. This is what happened. I've unlocked his phone. Just check what's in it yourself. Is this Dr. Ananth Krishna's phone? Yes. Check the conversations between him and the Ghost. They both are connected. Only through him can I find out more. I need your help. That is all I ask for. I've been with you for thirty years. For the first time, I'm confused about everything. I don't get it. Your Crown Jewel's gone. Micheal and Raja were killed. Raja Ranganath, your laboratory and your empire, has all been destroyed! The Ghost has targetted you. He wants you. Something has slipped past you, Baby. You've missed it. I have never missed anything in life! In my entire lifetime, I've never missed anything. Baby... [STUTTERS] Cool down baby. But I also should know who he is, right? If he has destroyed all of this... His main target, has to be me. If he has to destroy me, he has to face me, man-to-man. He is the one who strikes terror in the sky He is the one who tames the earth He is the one reigning the fortress loaded with crores of rupees He is the one who can leave even the four-headed Brahma, dazed and confused He is one in a Crore The Lion in back and he roars again He is one in a Crore He is like a flaring fire He is one in a Crore Make way for the roaring ruler Watch out, for he showers with wads of cash He’s our answer to take over the thrones of Kubera Even in dreams, he shall guard the cash with his life He is the one, the one in a Crore. If he rebels, who is to blame? Who is to blame? He’ll keep Lord Shiva, up all night. Up all night. If he stands his ground and decides to wage war He’ll be the victorious monarch. The clinking sounds of coins is his wake up call He's the one who can escape Lord Shiva's Third Eye. He is one in a Crore The Lion in back and he roars again He is one in a Crore He is like a flaring fire He is one in a Crore Make way for the roaring ruler What is Priya up to? It's switched off now. Tom, let's move. He’s the persevering genius. A persistent man. Come what may, he doesn’t accept defeat. He doesn't accept defeat. His magical hands have the power of the Midas touch. He has the powerful ability to stand up against all hurdles like a reservoir. He can attain numerous avatars just like Lord Vishnu of Vaikunta. One in a Crore The Lion is back and he roars again He is one in a Crore He is like a flaring fire He is one in a Crore Make way for the roaring ruler You mean to say that it was him who got you here, made sure you escape the cops, and then help you get Priya? Thank God you finally get it! - But why? Only if I'm out on the streets can he blame all his crimes on me? What can he do if I'm inside? But why am I being dragged into this fancy love story happening between you and him? Can't you see him talking? Why are you interrupting him? Why are you laughing like that? I can see your future very clearly. Back home it was me, and over here, it's you. Keep your prison clothes ready. Was a joke necessary at this moment? A man laughs at two points in his life. One is when someone cracks a joke, and the second is... When he loses his shit! Our beloved cops will arrive any moment, and take us all out on a jolly ride. I won't let that happen. If the Interpol arrives, I'll give them ...a statement that you're not Ghost but Sathya. There's no doubt, they will come for sure. Will they come for real? I was just kidding. Madam's phone has a tracker. Sathya? - It's okay. Let them come. Only if they arrest me will everything come to an end. Or else he'll continue with his atrocities and I'll keep running from the cops. Drat. My luck has... - Why the frown? It's not that. The prison food here is not good. It's just that, all that we people of Karnataka need, is Ragi Mudde-Saaru. We'll be contented in life. Shiva, stop right there! Dean? I know all of you have a lot of questions about him. I'll answer them all. Shiva is not a criminal, Sathya. He's your elder brother. No one will be given medicines without prescription. I've already told you all this. I don't want to hear any excuses later. Sarva Samanjhasam... Loka Samastha Sukhinobhavantu... What happened? Are you worried? You seem to be praying a lot. I'm teaching them. - Teaching who? To my children? Can a child inside the womb hear everything? Six months in the womb, our children can hear and feel everything. That is why one is advised to say and hear good things. You're taking a lot of time for each patient. My legs are hurting from all the standing. There's no chair for us to sit. We're not running a charity to provide you with chairs and beds. Next in line. Keep moving. Shiva... Sathya... In sometime, Amma might get tensed. Don't get scared. It'll only take a few minutes. Where is the receipt? - My husband will get it. Oh really? So you'll give birth and he'll get the receipt, is it? Brother, I've walked for four kilometres. Before I can go and come back, the hospital will be closed. I'm tired and stressed out. Weren't you stressed out while sleeping with your husband? Your job is to ask for the prescription, provide the ...medicines and walk away as you count your salary. Only because your father slept next to your mother and ...she struggled to give birth, you're here today. You are a public servant. You better not cross that limit. Do you know what will happen if you raise your hand on a public servant? Yes. You will be suspended. - And who will suspend me? You... Silence! Speak with respect. A man who doesn't respect women, isn't a man at all. Not even a human. You're unfit to be here. Tulsi? - Yes ma'am? I want to see the doctors and staff on duty, immediately. Yes, ma'am. Who is she? - Durga, IAS. She's the Commissioner of the Health Department. Yes madam? What's happening here? We received a lot of complaints. There's no respect to those who visit. There's no place to sit and the atmosphere here was pathetic. I saw it for myself. Sorry ma'am, it's just that... Tulsi? Issue a memo pointing out their negligence of duty. Okay, ma'am. I want an explanation within 48 hours. And you.. are suspended. What is all this? Election's due in six months. Do we need this fiasco now? Who is this?! It's Durga, the one who challenged her transfer order, ...took it up with the CAT and managed to hold on to her position. The Health Commissioner. All of them are desperate for publicity! Ask her to come over. What is all this? - Punishment for the wrongdoers. So? You think you can blow the issue and seek publicity? I've no desire to become a celebrity. A pregnant lady, huh? Take your seat. Please sit down. - Thank you, sir. Hear me out. We are also here to do some good work. If such small issues are blown up, Won't it affect our Government's reputation? No, sir. One shouldn't hide issues just because they may damage the reputation. One can't become a human without erring. Without making amends, one can't earn experiences. Without salt, food doesn't taste good. Also, we must respect every drop of water. Whether it comes from the eye or the sky. What we get from up there, is a blessing of the farmers. But when it comes from here, it's a woman's curse. Women are the ones experiencing a lot of grief. Especially, pregnant women. If you can announce a scheme for them, you can do damage control. Go on. Tell me what the scheme is. The scheme can be named as "Tavaru Bhagya" Why does every woman head to her mother's home for pregnancy? Because in their mother's home they're showered with love and good nurturing. What if Government hospital provide the same food and atmosphere? How is that? If the responsibility of nurturing pregnant women is taken up by the Government and ...the hospitals turn into their Cradle for real; the votes of all the women are yours. Her husband's vote. Her family's vote will be yours. It's a good idea. Let's implement this. We'll never know if we'll ever come back to power. But we'll have the satisfaction of having done good for the people in our term. Yeah, I agree. He's a good leader and this is an excellent idea. But implementing this won't be a cakewalk. Good people will always face troubles for their goodness. But it is foolishness to go looking for trouble on our own. Whatever comes easily to us, won't last for long, brother. Durga, you speak of healthy children, a better India and a bright future. However there is a criminal who wishes that ...children remain sick and suffer from diseases. Just so that his company supplies all the medicines benefiting from all the misery. Who is he? Devendra. The diseases women and children suffer from, are his investment. The treatment given to them is his business. The medicines they consume make for his profit. When a child is in the womb, in the name of treatment, ...they inject drugs manufactured by his company into its stem cells. There's no way the child will be born healthy. In the future, no drugs other than his own company can cure the child. As per his whim, he takes a call on the region and season ...to spread a disease, thereby releasing the virus accordingly. He then releases the necessary antidote to the market, becoming the big saviour. Parents are always concerned about their new-born. They do as the doctors say. He ensures that the doctors speak for him. All of this is interconnected. It is all in his control. Commissioner Durga! Was it you who seized my Pharmaceutical factory? Yep. I'm the reason you have ants in your pants. Now I know. I was wondering which bow this arrow came from. It doesn't matter what bow it was from. Once the arrow has reached it's target, the war has begun. A war? On me? You'll die. Everything is now in line. Let peace prevail everywhere. Shiva and Sathya? You don't have to worry. Give me a while. Amma will get back to normal soon. Take him away. Durga, the arrow has been found. I shall find out about the bow which fired it, and announce the war. You better be prepared. Don't give me reasons, Prakash. Does your business mean more than your wife and kids? Haven't you prioritised your career over your health? Do you really need this pressure? - Prakash... Arguing will only upset me more. It will affect my children. So, let's stop it. Twenty days more to go. Come soon. Until then, I'll make sure the kids are healthy and safe. You are responsible for their future, okay? Okay. Take care. I love you. I miss you. Bye. Dad is always busy with his business. That upsets me. But he does it for our good, right? I'm angry that he doesn't spend time with you guys. When he comes to visit you, take him to task. My dear, lend an ear to this song For the next few days, play in there Stretch your legs, without any worry Wait for a while, before you get to see this world Grab the finger with your tiny hands Until then, hold up, my child This womb is now your playground Rejoice for nine months without exhausting yourselves My dear, lend an ear to this song For the next few days, play in there Waving the peacock feather, thrilling us with the anklets You’re mischievous, just like Lord Krishna Playing with your eyes closed, powerful enough to bring a stone to life You’re kin, just like Lord Rama Not everyone who takes birth, can earn the title of a good human being Your values will be your only beacon to lead you to the right path, my dear My dear, lend an ear to this song For the next few days, play in there Shiva! Let go of her! - Durga! Don't do anything to her. Durga?! Devendra! Weren't you chanting a mantra? Go on. Let me hear it. Please don't do anything to her. - I have no enemy. Those who become my enemies, shouldn't survive on this earth. Baby, don't. She's a woman. When you've set out to wipe out your enemies, One shouldn't even spare the offspring. They won't survive. When the mother won't make it, how will the kids survive? I promise. - Make sure you confirm. Mother, we're sorry. Durga! Wake up! Brother! - Yes, Durga? Shiva has taken the beating to protect Sathya. Do everything necessary and save him! He'll be fine. Don't worry. Shiva? Sathya? Mother will always be with you. Durga, the operation will happen soon. - I can't do this, brother. Don't worry. Sarvam Samanjhasam... Loka... Durga? Doctor, control yourself. We have to conduct a Caesarean right away to save the kids. I got the injured child in my sister's womb sent to an Ashram. I gave the other child to the father. I was accused by everyone... Accused of killing my own sister for the greed of her property. Devendra made sure that I went to prison. When I got out of prison, I couldn't find a clue about you or your father. I went to the Ashram, and with the permission of the sage, ...took Shiva and left the country. For having buried your mother's dream, and building an empire on it, Shiva decided to destroy Devendra, gradually. I supported him. For someone who protected you right when he was in his mother's womb... Do you think he would want to hurt you now? Till date, he's been saving you at every possible step, without letting you know. When we first saw you at Raja Ranganath's felicitation ceremony, ...we could've revealed the truth that had escaped you. Seeing the trust you had on him, we realised that ...you won't trust us until you saw his real side. Raja Ranganath was Devendra's head of Indian operations. Shiva systematically broke all the branches of Devendra's gigantic empire. Now all that is left is... The root of the empire. Devendra. To make his mother's dream come true, Shiva has made the ...complete destruction of Devendra, his ultimate aim. To save you, he hatched a plan. He made sure you were caught in the restaurant and got you here. Shiva is your brother, Sathya. The mouse is trapped. I knew Devendra would target Jaanu. I put a tracker on her. I can see her movement. Sathya, use this phone to track her live location. Save Jaanu! Kishore, you wait... What?! Me? Priya, give your mobile to Kishore. Uncle, take Priya and leave. Come Priya. What about you, Shiva? Our Interpol guests are on their way, tracking your phone. They will be here any moment. Move. He'll take care of it, Priya. - Wait.. What?! What shall I do over here? Freeze! Hands up! Don't move! You're both under arrest. Stay still. I said don't move. Tell me, Kangana. - Sir! We got both Ghost and his boss. That's great. - Thank you, sir. We're bringing them to the headquarters right now. Okay good. I'm on my way now. I'm sorry, Kangana. We're going to Devendra's place. Tom, what are you doing? This is not right. - You do what I tell you to do. You know what'll happen if Sharath... - I'm telling you to drive. What are you doing? Kangana?! Don't play games with me. Just do as I say. Kangana? - Or I'll blow your head off. Fine. I'll drive. - You do that. I'll drive to Devendra's place. - Okay. What is this new twist? Where are you taking us? - Shut it! All units standby. You'll have to follow us to the exact location. Over and out. This is Sharath here. I need Kangana's live location sent to my phone immediately. Will do, sir. - Quick. Martin, there's a slight change in plan. So, we finally meet... The Ghost! Dev Pharma is my empire. You're trying to destroy it. Who are you? There's an intention behind everything. I have to know yours. Who the hell are you?! Durga, the Health Commissioner. She was my mother. I just don't believe this. Aren't you a twin? Where is the other guy? Where is he? He's Goddamn above you all. Beyond you! You killed his mother, and he's set your empire on fire. Sathya considers that child as his mother. Your son has troubled her, and you think he'll spare him? Try and save your son first. He's right behind him. Hey, Dad. - Jeet, where are you? I'm getting the kid to you. Is everything okay there? - Everything is fine, Dad. Check and tell me if everything is really okay! Sir?! Sir, I didn't do anything. I don't know anything, madam. All these days, I kept screaming that they weren't two of them but one. I was right. He is one. One in a Crore! Good morning Ladies & Gentlemen! This press briefing is regarding the murder case of Devendra. ACP Kishore who is often known among the media as the Ghost's boss, has killed him. It was a case of personal revenge because of the Crown Jewel heist. Excuse me? So, what about the Ghost? Well, as usual... He got away from the murder scene However, his brother Sathya has been released as he was found innocent. But we are still trying to find the Ghost. We will catch him! Sir, this is ridiculous. You've hidden the truth from the Press. What did I hide? You know it was the Ghost who did all of this! But we arrested ACP Kishore. Kishore killed Devendra and we saw it ourselves We are the eyewitnesses. So, we arrested Kishore. Then where did the 750 Million Euros go? You want to know where the money is? This is where all the money went. The money has reached the hands of everyone who suffered at the hands of Devendra. Ghost is not a criminal. He's actually a saviour. If he's out there, criminals like Devendra will be scared to commit a mistake. I want him to be out there. Kangana, from here onwards this case is yours My work is done. Good luck. But sir, where is Ghost now?! Ghost! Don’t do this! If you do, Devil will come for you !! I want him to come for me.
