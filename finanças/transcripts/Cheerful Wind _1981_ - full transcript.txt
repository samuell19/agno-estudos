Sister. You didn't come alone? I brought them along to do some drawing. This is your teacher's sister. Hello, teacher's sister. Hello. Luo Jiewen, Luo Zai. My little brother. Hello Mr Luo. Luo Zai, We can't all get in the car. I'll call a taxi. No need, we'll bunch up a little. They're only kids, two for one seat, five for two seats. No problem, just bunch together. Be careful. Maybe calling a taxi wasn't a bad idea after all. Play that. Look! Over there, the blind guy that helped us in Penghu. Xinhui, where are you going? Hey! Hey, What are you doing in Taipei? Who are you? I'm Xiao Xinhui. You don't know me. Let me help you cross the street. Where do you bring me? Don't you want to cross the street? No, I'm going to the New Parc. The New Parc? Sorry, sorry. Come with me. We're there. Where Am I now? Here, here, New Parc's cow head I mean, the cow head, near the New Parc's entrance. Thank you. Why are you coming here? I run a fortune-telling stand. You know fortune-telling? A little bit. Then I'll come back to see you for a session. Fine. I have to go. Put your hand here. - Good bye. - Good bye. Liao Shuzhen I thought you wouldn't come. I didn't think there would be so many people. Sis, this is Liao Shuzhen. The sister of Liao Bingkun, from Zhunei. - Hello. - Hello. You live in Taipei? I live with my brother. She now takes private lessons. I used to be her teacher. She wasn't admitted this year, as her teacher, it's embarrassing. I have to go. You will find your way home? No problem. - Good, then I'll go. - OK. Come. Is it true that you can't see at all? That's true, I can't see at all. If you can't see, then it's all black? Well no, black is a colour too, and I can't see any colour. So if it's not black, what do you see? It's very hard to explain. He's blind, he sees nothing, that's all. Why do you keep asking questions. Here, I'll explain to you. Give me your hand. Look... This is his hand, right? He can use it to touch things. if something is soft, or hard, he can know by touching it, am I right? But a hand can't see. You understand? You can't see with your hand, so you can't say your hand sees black. Being blind is the same. There is no black. There are no colours. There is nothing left. You understand? What are you doing? Do you need fortune-telling? Yes. What do you want to know, miss? I... I already have two sons. My husband really wants a daughter. Touch my hand, tell me if there is hope. No hope. You are the girl that helped me cross the street yesterday. How did you know? I recognized your voice. And you have a pecular smell. A smell? But I don't wear perfume! It's not perfume. It's a kind of natural perfume. Natural perfume? Why do you do fortune-telling during the day? I remember the fortune-tellers only come in the evening here. I don't like the evening, it's more lively during the day. It's too dark in the evening, bad things can happen, I once got robbed. Really? Is fortune-telling easy? We can say that. I studied psychology and philosophy. Actually, we the chinese, we believe in fortune-telling the same way foreigner believe in psychology. I live here. Thank you for coming with me. You're welcome. Do you want to come in? Sure. Please have a seat. The couch is large. What do you drink? I... Anything Big Xiong, is that you? Yes Aren't you working day shift? My stomach hurts, I came back home to rest. I'm here. He's my classmate, Lin Maoxiong. He let me live here, temporarly. Please, have a seat. Jintai! There's a letter for you. It's from your dad, I think. I put it on the television. You... could read it for me, please? Ok. It's from Mr Gua Lin, 133 Guangming street, Tainan. It's my dad. Don't you live in Penghu? That's where my grandma lives, I'm from Tainan. Jintai, my son. Your grandma sent us a letter, she says you went back to Taipei in good condition. Lately, the weather is becoming bolder. "Colder". The weather is colder. My dad make mistakes. He didn't go to school very long. Son, you must wear warm clothes when you go out. You don't need to send more money home, keep it for yourself, and eat well. If it takes too long to wait for the a cornea, meanwhile you can come back home. Your mom misses you. On october 15th, for our temple anniversary, we will sacrifice a pig at home. Son, if you come home, send a letter to tell us when, so mom can meet you at the train station. Dad. Thank you. Your voice is beautiful. You're waiting for a new cornea? Yes. So your eyes can still be fixed? Yes. I thought you were born blind. How long since you can't see? More than two years. Two years ago I was a medical intern. One day, because the driver wasn't there, I drove the ambulance myself, I had an accident, and wounded my eyes. It damaged the cornea. I bring the films, here, help me and take it. Xinhui, Xinhui We got paid already. I thought, maybe we could leave earlier. We go to Hong Kong. It's cheaper to buy the plane tickets in Hong Kong.

I'm glad to help you. - We begin right away? - Yes "The Brothers Karamazov" Chapter 1: Fiodor Pavlovitch Karamazov. Alex?i Fiodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of a land owner from our district, Fiodor Pavlovitch, (Bastard!) whose terrible and tragic death, exactly 13 years ago, is still remembered nowadays. I will talk about this event later, but before, I will tell you about this landlord, just to say that he... Wait a second. Miss Xiao, I think we will stop here today. We will find someone else to continue the reading. Thank you. Miss Xiao. Here's some money for your trouble, all our readers receive it. Everyone, I apologize, I wasn't honest with you.

Wait until next month? It's not possible! I need to replace my brother for his classes. Replace him? Replace for what? He says he has to go to a tennis training camp for a month, then he has a tournament in Australia. I called Hong Kong yesterday, I talked about it to my mom, and now you say we can't go. Just call her again! And say what? I spend all morning discussing that with the boss. Now you say we'll leave a month later. How do I explain that? I don't see what is the problem. You said the boss wanted to make you stay. You can't act that way! I don't care. If you're in such a hurry, you can go to Hong Kong first. Otherwise, you go alone, and that's it. "Ivan looked at..."

She has a nose, two eyes, and a mouth. Be more specific. For exemple, you could say, who does she look like? like someone we know, a famous person? Aren't you going to Lupo? You will know when you see her. Please, I can't wait, I need to know what she looks like. You should change your glasses, use your new pair. Don't worry about that, tell me what she looks like. She looks like miss Chen. Miss Chen? She's that fat? No, no, she's not fat. I'm just saying, there is a resemblance. Physically, she looks a bit like Ma Gongji's girlfriend. Her hair looks like Fara's. But she's got black hair, not blonde. Wait. You tell me, I draw. Sick eyebrow... One second. a bit like a man. thick eyebrow, like a man. The eyes... very big. Nice two-folded eyelid. A beautiful straight nose. Very elegant. Wait. Wait. How is the nose? Straight nose. Very elegant. A small mouth. Very cute. small... cute... The face... shaped like a duck's egg. duck's egg... Teacher Xiao, a letter. Weren't you supposed to write slogans on the walls? Yes, slogans, but I find painting is more lively, more interesting. The director, she knows? No. Why? She'll be mad? Hello miss. Wh... What's... Teacher Xiao What are you doing here? We're painting. We paint the world under water. It will make the school more beautiful. I asked you to write slogans, not to paint on the walls. Why would you take this kind initiative? What if the school inspector was to come? If he disapproves, who is he going to blame? This could hurt the reputation of the school, or even of the village. Do you understand? I apologize. I thought you would be pleased. I'm sorry. Excusez-moi. When you brother said you'd come to replace him, I had doubts. When you were in class, you were the most mischievous. Now you're back as a teacher for two weeks, and you're doing exactly the same. - You have the nerve to laugh? - No. I was looking at a portrait of me, couldn't help laughing. Potrait of you? What potrait? It doesn't look like you! How could that be your portrait? A blind man drew it. Gu Jintai. I'm Xiao Xinhui. You're Xiao Xinhui? Look I am different from what you thought? Yes. Yes. There's a big difference. I didn't think... I brought this for you. Thank you. But, I'm not really Xiao Xinhui. Xiao Xinhui is over there. I'm Xiao Xinhui. Hello. Hello. The weather changes fast around here. Yes. We are in Xiaobantian, weather in the mountains changes just like that. How did it feel to open your eyes and see again? Like a ray of light so sharp that I couldn't open my eyes. As if I came out of a dungeon. And now? Now I feel very good. Although, when I saw that friend of yours who's pregnant, I didn't feel so good. I was disappointed. Can't you recognize the voices? I was dizzy, how could I notice anything. It reminds me a story: There were two pen pals, they'd never met each other. Then, when they finally decided to meet, they chose to use a rose as a sign. The woman, so she could probe the man, asked an old lady to replace her. And so, as the man appeared to be very elegant, he got her to love him. These are people in olden days. People now, if it's someone ugly, they turn around and leave. I like better how it used to be. People were more ramantic. Dad. Mum. We have a guest. Hello sir. A- hui, isn't he blind? He had a treatment. A treatment? Science is really making progress nowadays. Medicine is progressing. Yes, medicine. - Can you see here? - Yes, yes. My mum. Hello. Congratulations. Come inside, we'll make some tea. A- hui, come over here. A- hui, is that the Hong Kongese? No. No? How can you have so many boyfriends? That's not it! He's just a friend. He's going back home, stopped by here for a couple days. He's just a friend, but he's staying here for two days? A- hui, be careful what you do. I don't want to hear gossips all over the neighbourhood. There won't be. It's you! Hurry up, I'll catch you. Bye bye. Go home now. Good bye. Don't forget your homework. Do you have fake teeth? What? Do you have fake teeth? - Fake teeth? My mum says, when looking for a spouse, it's important that she has good teeth. I only know, when you buy a cow or a goat, you must pick those with good teeth. Yes, it's the same principle. I want to get married, but so far, I haven't found the good partner. I think that you suit perfectly. Are you asking me to marry you? Yes. I would like you to marry me. I'm serious, I'm not joking around. I would have asked you sooner or later, so why not telling you now. To ask it early has some benefits. What benefits? It forces you to think about it. And I don't have to spend my energy to court you. Because anyway, the result of courting is to get married. The other day when you came find me, if you had found me ugly, you'd still say that? Yes. I thought about it As long as you're not really too ugly, I'm fine. But, I don't want to get married yet. I still want to go to... Europe. Spain. See the world. Hey, move, move. I can wait for you. And if I don't come back? I might want to live abroad for a long time. That's not a problem. I just want you to make a promise. And if nescessary, I can go find you. "Green tree by the school", get ready to sing. Okay, stop moving, I'll take the picture. I'm taking the picture now. Smile. Smile. Don't move! Let me take it. Go over there, I'll take a picture. Fine. Wait, wait. What? Wait. What are you doing? Wait a minute. Am I pretty? I can't stand you! You ready? How do I look? When do you go back to Taipei? I don't know. Contact me when you have time. Alright. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I come find you when I'm in Taipei? Yes. Bye. - Who is it? - You brother. You're back? - Yes. - You didn't call me? I would have gone get you. You have time for it? The training ended, I got home tomorrow. - Already? - Yes. What time is it? Ten o'clock. Hello? I'm listening! Hey! Who is this? Is this a joke? Speak before I get angry. It's Xiao Xinhui. Xiao Xinhui! You're home? I'm home. - Where are you now? - Home. I'm coming to see you, ok? You can't come now. It's too late, I'm going to bed. Well... tomorrow then. I invite you for dinner tomorrow night. Fine. Wait, no. In the morning. I can't wait until the evening. You don't work in the morning? I do. I start at 8, I'll come find you at 7.

I need to open up my schedule. I don't want to waste a minute, not even a second. Maybe I should tie us together. Ok, stop it. People are watching. I invite you for lunch today. Alright, thank you. - You're ok? - Yes. Look. It's not a swimming competition! - Let me, let me. - I don't need your help. - I'll do it. - No, get out. You really don't want me to help? - You'll be sorry! - I won't. I already asked to be transfered at Lugu's hospital. Really? I'd rather be close from your home. That way I can see you often, and I'll get to know your family better. Wait for me, I'm going to the toilets, I didn't have time earlier. I don't make a lot of money, later, we might have some difficult times. Is it ok with you? I haven't even promised to marry you yet. - Then promise now, ok?. - Alright. What's wrong? Feeling dizzy. Idiot. Weren't you supposed to go home? I take the 1:30 train. I still had time, so I went to find her at her school. This is Liao Shuzhen, and this is my brother. This is Gu Jintai. Hello. Well, you two get going. Yes. We're going. What are you doing here? I'm going to the institute for the blind, read a book for them. Is everything ready? Not yet. I'll wait for you, we'll go together. You're leaving tomorrow, and I don't want to waste a second. Hey? How come you're here? How are your eyes? I'm Luo Jiewen. Luozai. The film in Penghu, it was me. - You're the director for the ad film? - That's right. So? You can see clearly? I can see. That day when you went to change your cornea, I wanted to go see you. How many fingers? 4? 5? I see very clearly. You also go abroad? I'm going to Europe with her. My turn. He's going to Europe with you? Why didn't you tell me? It's not important. I wanted to tell you, but... there's nothing to be told. What's your relation with him? We're coworkers. Just coworkers? If you were just coworkers, you wouldn't hide it from me. What's your relation with her? Relation? What relation do you have with Xiao Xinhui? She's my girlfriend. Are you engaged? Her dad wants us to, but it's tiresome. "Even the birds stay quiet." I'm sorry. I can't read more now. Ah, it's you? Is Jintai here? He hasn't come back yet. Come in. - I'll wait for him here. - Fine. Have a seat. Jintai, I've never promised him anything. We're just working in the same company, we just naturally ended up together. If I had never met you, maybe in a few years, if he were to ask me, I would have married him. But it's different with you. I already made a promise with you. My plane takes off at 12:55. If you don't come to the airport, I don't get on the plane. I just don't go. Maybe not long from now I'll become your wife. I wholeheartedly hope so, because I know, I will never find someone that makes me feel like as I feel with you. I will keep my word, but I wouldn't forget, that if I don't go to Europe, it would have been because of you. You might say that I can also go after we get married. But it's different. Because going to Europe is my own dream. Whatever price I have to pay, it's very important for me. Jintai. If you don't go in, it'll be too late. I'll be back soon. There's no hurry. Go have some good time. Even if you don't come back, it's fine. I'll come if you need me. Go. = Translation: Guillaume C. =
