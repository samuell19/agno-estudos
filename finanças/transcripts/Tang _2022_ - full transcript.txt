What should I do? Which one first? What to do? Hey. Hey! There's a robot in the back garden. Huh? Ah, there's going to be a verdict in the case today, right? Have a good day! The world's most popular recipes loaded into a sophisticated body. Choose the menu and have it cooked by a top chef. Here for you, Digital With Heart. Atobit Systems. Did you hear me? People will talk. Huh? There's a weird robot in the back garden. It's creepy, can you get rid of it? What is it? Is it an android? I wish it were... If only I had a state-of-the-art chef android with 30,000 recipes and the option to take the bins out rather than a husband who plays games all day. We're the only ones without one. I take the bins out. You last did it two weeks ago. The bin takes ages to fill. Because I take it out! Huh? Really?! That reminds me, the back gate's still broken. That's probably how it got in. While I think of it... how was the interview? You haven't told me about it yet. Huh? Ken? What? Where's my bagel? What does she want a chef android for? I don't want a machine like that wandering around the house. Hey. Hey! What are you? Where'd you come from? What're you doing here? Hey, let go. Hey, let go of me! What?! What~ Huh? What are you? A talking type? What's your name? Name? Yeah. I'm Ken. Ken. Name. Tang. Tang? I mean... you're a bit dirty though. You're dirty. Huh? Where am I dirty? What are you laughing at? Hey. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Stop copying me. Stop copying me. Geez! Ken chan, where's the serial number? You can't recycle it without one. I don't know, it's not mine. You can ask stuff like 'where'd it come from', 'who owns it', but I haven't a clue. Oh. This is good, it'd make a perfect handle. Eh? So it was illegally dumped? There's no power switch. Huh? If I'm not mistaken, this is... Atobit Systems? They're a major android manufacturer. I've never seen this model before though. I'm not sure what it is, but we could take it off your hands. If we dismantle it, we could use it for parts. Thanks for that Oh chan. Ken. Huh? Ken... Well then. Huh?! Where'd it go? Oh no, Ken... I can't believe you're wandering around dressed like that. Being dressed like that, makes you look like a freeloader sponging off his wealthy wife. Hey sis... still as harsh as ever. Your mouth and make-up too. Oh, yeah, Ken... didn't you have a job interview yesterday? Uh... later! Come on! Sort yourself out! You really can't do anything properly anymore. Is this the residence of Ken Kasugai? Yes. I'm Terayama from Hokuto Medical Centre. Yes? I'm calling with regards to yesterday's interview. Ah, you gave me a shock. You're still here. Look at this, I've found something good. I'm going to fix the back gate now. What about this room? Huh? Someday this'll be a nursery. We talked about that before, didn't we? Here? Ah... But I wonder if it gets enough sun. It gets plenty of sunlight. Why didn't you go to the interview? Huh? There was a phone call. The hospital that your sister introduced you to, the one that said they might accept you as a resident... Oh... Erm... I forgot. Explain yourself properly! Aren't you going back to your medical training? I will. Are you lying to me? What're you going to do now? Come on, don't give me that scary look. There's no need for me to rush back into work. You're going to live leisurely on your inheritance?! I'm not living leisurely. Ken. Why is that still here?! Yeah, I wonder why. That's a bit weird, come on... I got rid of it. I really did get rid of it. Huh?! Ah, but wait a minute... look at him... He seems kinda happy. It's a robot. It doesn't have feelings. Ah! Isn't it time for work?! Won't you miss the trial? Come on, you'll have to hurry. You really don't do anything for me, do you? Ken. Shh. I'm the one who's working, I clean the house, I wind the clock every morning. Ken! Be quiet. What exactly do you do? Ah, that's right, I'm going to fix the gate handle. That's enough!! How long are you going to run away from it all for? What did you do that for? That was my dad's treasured... Then why don't you wind it yourself? That's enough! You have to move on! What's your plan? Shut up! I don't care anymore! Then do whatever the hell you want! Hey, wait! Stop... Don't come back! What?! What? What. 'Don't come back' she says, but that's my house. Wow. Huh? Have you peed yourself? You're such a piece of junk. What's... piece of junk? Well... it means something useless. What's useless? It's when you wet yourself. Moving towards a world where people and robots coexist. We're currently running a special promotion. Return old models to headquarters... ...in exchange for a new model? If I take this... I could get a present for Emi. Hmm? Cart coming through. Yes, of course. Oh, hey, look, look. I've never seen one like that before. What's that? What a mess. Yeah, it's a right piece of junk. Hey, look. What is it? Woof. Woof. Hey, what are you doing? Come on. Huh? What is it? Well, you certainly stand out. Tang. That's not a compliment. What's with that old robot? You need to calm down. It's more than 80 years since space exploration begun. Recently, the issue of space debris has become increasingly problematic. A new life is born... a chick has emerged. The mother bird protects the little lives around her... Yeah! We found the treasure! Wow! Amazing! But the most precious thing... is friends. Luke is there for Yu. Yu is there for Luke. Luke is there for Yu. Yu is there for Luke. Ow. Stop that. Little shit. Little shit. Why on earth do you have that feature? Ken, bad word. Yeah. Little shit. Little shit. What? Ken, bad word. Little shit. -Is he talking about you Hayato? -Probably. Bad word. Little shit. Stop it. Stop it. Hey! Little shit. Why can't do you do anything right, you shitty robot. You're useless. I'll dump you as soon as we get to the airport. You piece of junk! Waaaah! Tang not junk! Hot! What's going on?! We have closed for the day. We came all this way, and they're closed. What the hell?! What are you doing? Treasure. No one uses coins like that anymore. What's... coin? Money. Well... you exchange it for things you want. Give it... get thing? No one's going to take it, you piece of junk. Geez... Won't take treasure? Ken? Ken. Ken, jump with me! Come on, that's enough, stop now. No one does that! I'm exhausted. That's enough! You have to move on! She's a brilliant lawyer, and I'm just unemployed. -His vitals are dropping. -Are you okay? Shall I take a blood sample, doctor? He's losing consciousness. What should we do, doctor?! Ken... There's no pulse, he's in VF! Get the intubation kit! Saturation's dropping! Do we go for central venous or peripheral? How do we do it? Tell us what to do! Which way doctor?! Did you do that? Don't pretend to be asleep! I brought you piece of junk all the way here, and now I can't have a coffee. Useless piece of junk. Useless! Ken scary. Wait~ I'm finally going be free. I'm very sorry. We can't accept it back because it's not our model. What?! Well... What about this 'exchange upon evaluation'... It's not applicable. Yeah, but even so, he's got the parts inside him, right? It's not applicable. The first robot was actually born in 1927. The Telebox was released in the USA. After that, humanoids were born. The first Japanese bipedal robot was in 1973. Hey, look, it's the oldest robot ever! Cute! Cute! Face me. What's... cute? There? Where? Hmm? Do we have one of these? No! What's wrong? Are you okay? What are you doing? Ah, it's a ladybird! It's a ladybird! A ladybird! That's right, amazing! Ah, it flew away. Bye bye. Bye bye. See you again! Is that your kid? Ah, yeah. Could I... take a little look at it? Huh? Please, take a seat. Hmm? Something to drink? Yes, could I have a coffee? I'm afraid I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I have herbal tea, soy milk... Shiitake mushroom tea? I'll be fine thanks. Hmm? I'm supposed to be in charge of design. Hey, stop it. I don't know why I sometimes get assigned to do tours. Stop it... hey! Perhaps it's... my good looks. Must be. What's this? Oh... Something was leaking. Give me a minute. Okay. Ken, what's that? Ah... a bird. Bi~rd. And that? Ah... sweets. Sweets. And that? A narcissist. Ah~ What's this? What's that liquid? There are various possibilities. Lubricant, coolant, fuel. If this runs out, Tang will break down. He'll stop functioning. I can say that for sure. Right. That's a temporary fix. Treasure! Curiosity? Hmm? Bird. Little bird... big bird! Empathy with living things... imagination... Tang... is something quite special. Special? With the current state of AI, this is unimaginable. There's no way... he can't do anything. You can't be serious. Maybe... the person who made Tang, using our parts... This way... that way. ...was in a hurry... and was planning to upgrade him later. They just used what was on hand. Ken, Narcissist! Who? What on earth for? My friends... is there anyone who can fix this robot? His name is Tang. Ah, here we are. Wow, what is it? I want to meet Tang. I might be able to fix him. Ootsuki sensei. Se... sensei? She'll be able to do it, no doubt. She majored in robotics. Now she works at the world's biggest space science museum. A museum? Is it nearby? It's in Shenzhen, in China. Ch... China?! Yeah, but that's so far... To me, he's just... But... If you leave him like this... he'll stop functioning and break down. My name's Tang. Are you okay with that? Little bird. What are you going to do? Friend. Ah... Is there somewhere around here where I could get a coffee? There's no way I'm going to China, but they won't take him back... What the hell am I supposed to do? Ken. What's that? Oh... it's a festival or something. A festival?! Tang! I've never seen a robot like that before. It's a bit scruffy. Where are you? Treasure. Welcome. It's hot, so please be careful. Thank you. Ken! Ken! Huh? Is that for me? Tang is there for Ken. Ken is there for Tang. Mmm. Delicious. Shall we go together? To Shenzhen? Yes! Together! Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang. Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang. Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang. Any news from Ken? Nothing. He's probably just being cautious. He's afraid that if you yell at him again, you might break something else. I know. I always seem to lose my temper these days... I hate myself for it. Well, it's understandable though, isn't it? He's always taking advantage you. When I first met him, he had a huge smile on his face when he told me his dream was to become a doctor. But after what happened with your father... Ever since then... Because you're there for him... he'll be fine. I'm sure my father would feel the same. It means a lot to me. There's something... I haven't told him yet. Huh? You're looking for... a robot? Ken, hurry! Hey. Don't rush off without me. Look Ken. Amazing. Pretty. What are you doing Tang? Stop messing about, come on. We've just arrived in Shenzhen. We're getting close... it's just a matter of time. Yes, we'll find him soon. Hey, what are you dawdling for? Come on, let's go. Hey, the car's that way. Ah? Chinese: Okay, carry it through! Ah, be careful. Chinese: Carefully. Chinese: Okay, thanks. Excuse me... It's Ootsuki sensei... right? Ah, Kasugai Ken! For short, KasuKen. Huh? You must be Tang then? You made it here. I really wanted to meet you! Ah... thanks. Don't hold back! I'm going to look after you today. 1. A cruise ship to Fortune Alley. 2. From the viewing platform to Fortune Alley. 3. From the Botanical Garden to Fortune Alley. Which one? So Fortune Alley is a must then? Well, of course, Shenzhen is a fortune-telling paradise! Enjoy yourself KasuKen, Erm... can we change that name... Then Ken! By the way, what's your date of birth? Huh? In Onmyōdō astrology, your birth date defines which of the nine signs... Ah... don't worry about me... If you'd just be able to tell me anything about Tang... Huh? Where'd he go? Treasure. Ah~ Ah~ Treasure. Wah! Yes, we've got him. We'll be waiting for you in the warehouse in the old town. That was easier than I thought. I really thought I'd get to try this out. Hey, don't do anything stupid. We've been told to collect this robot without damaging it. Do you know what my work policy is? What? When I do something, I do it right! Huh? Did I turn the power up too high? Hey. Huh? You were going to try it out on me, weren't you? Of course not. Yeah, you were. No, even though you're the most successful of my peers and have been constantly in my way, -I'd never do that to you. -You so would. How many reasons do you need? I want some real Chinese food. Scary. Tang! Ken! Tang? Hey, what the... Wait! Hey! Ken! Tang! Ken! Tang! Ken! Tang! Here, throw him this. Hurry! Okay! Ken~! What the hell? Our access passes have GPS. Huh? It stopped! North-northwest... that's a bad direction. See, I knew it. Bad luck. We have to help him quickly. Where is Tang? Probably the warehouse district. Someone's trying to kidnap him. That piece of junk? He's not worth a penny. I wouldn't be so sure. Huh? Hayashibara kun told me all about him. Tang's brain architecture could be completely autonomous. Ah... excuse me... I don't know what you're saying. Well, to put it simply, The most common AI is 1st generation machine learning. For example, this one. Navigate from the bus stop to the location. Of course. Okay. Next is 2nd generation machine learning which uses deep learning for more advanced processing. Its learning ability exceeds humans. And supposedly, what Tang is... doesn't yet exist in this world. 3rd generation machine learning. Th... third generation? Self-motivated learning and development, with versatile, general intelligence. Basically... Huh? He's human-like? That's why he was taken. Someone's trying to obtain it from him. That would explain a lot. Sorry. -Ah, Ken! -Yeah. You're married? Yeah. Well... kinda... Where's your wife? You should have brought her. Well... she has work. We're here today... to celebrate Emi Yamashina... becoming an associate! Congratulations! Thank you. Shall we have Emi chan open the champagne? Here we go! Sorry. -Nice catch. -Ah... It gave me a shock. It's a little difficult to join in, right? Well... Ah, thanks. I mean... what even is this party for today? I'm sorry, but... it's to celebrate the fact that I became an associate. Huh?! I'm so sorry. Ah... so you're at the same firm as my sister? Yes. Sorry. But I've still got a long way to go. I'm really quite nervous about it. Me too. Huh? Ah, well... I just started my medical residency. I don't have the skill or the experience yet, but even so, I still want to help people. Yeah. Everything will be alright. Ah... you can have this if you like. Huh? Ah... from now on, if you're having a difficult time You can look at it and remember: everything will be alright. Thank you. Okay. -He's somewhere round here. -Ah... okay. Hide! In there... Sorry, just a minute. -A phone call. -Huh? Ken?! I'm sorry, now's not... This won't take long, so just listen. Huh? Emi? I'll... be out of the house soon. Huh? So... you can come back whenever you like. S... sorry... what do you mean? I've reached my limit. I'm sick of babysitting you. Now that you're gone... I feel so much better. I want us to separate. I just want this to be over. Ok... ay... So... are you having an argument with your wife? Bull's eye. It seems she's leaving home. She said she wants it to be over. Well, whatever. You have no self-confidence. You're just dwelling on the past and putting on a brave face. What kind of fortune's that? It isn't. It isn't a fortune. Ken... at times like this... Now! Ah... yes! Mmm... looks delicious. What was that noise? Are you hearing things? There's a rumour that your obsession with your career is driving you insane. That's you, isn't it? It's such a shabby little robot... what's so great about it? Hey! What name were you saying? Ken... Ken? So you're Ken are you? Hey, Ken chan, Ken chan. Hey, grab my hand. -Hey, come on, he's not a dog. -Hey. Who is this Ken? Friend. What do you mean, friend? What's a robot talking about that for? It's absurd. Ah... I'm hungry. Come on, the yakisoba's getting cold. Come on, we can toast with a beer. I shouldn't drink, I'm still on duty. You are? You are too. Tang. Ken! Can't get... out. Wait, there must be a key card. Huh? Oh. Ken! Tang! Oh oh... Tang! What are you doing? Hurry. That's far enough. That robot... does not belong to you. It's them... Doctor Katou! Good evening! Erm... who are you people? I told you to keep an eye on him! It's not what you think. He said I had to have a drink with him. Don't lie! I knew it. The neurochip. There's no doubt. It's Professor Baba's. Professor Baba? You can't mean...? Where did you get this? Who did you get it from? What on earth is he? You people don't understand the gravity of the situation. We're taking this back. No! What do you mean? Let go. If you insist on getting any more involved in this, we won't be letting you walk away free. Ahh~ No! What should we do? Let go! I don't care about that thing anymore. Huh? Huh? I'm leaving you! You... piece of junk! Tang not junk! Huh? Ow! Tang! Ow! Owch! Let go! Tang! That was way better than I expected. Hurry, while you still can! Is that guy okay? He makes sound. He's okay. What do you mean? It looks like heartbeat detection. I'll call the police right away. Get Tang out of here. Yeah, but... Professor Masahiko Baba, the robotics expert, find him and get Tang fixed. Hurry! Run! Hey, wait! But... don't run away from your wife. Hang in there. I think this is far enough, we should be okay. Ken~ Wa... it... What's wrong Tang? Let me have a look inside. Ah... If this runs out, Tang will stop functioning and break down. There's no time. We have to fix it now. Is that Kasugai san? Ah... Yes. I'm Baba. I heard you've been taking care of my little one. Ah... he's here. Ahh... James! Thank goodness you're okay. Huh? James? Yes. I made him. Er... he's... broken. There's a crack here. That's terrible. I'll fix him right away. Please. He looks like he's overheating. He should be okay after a little rest. Big clouds~ Blue~ Sea~ Tang. I was assigned to a project at the Cybernetics Asia android lab. My aim was to create the ultimate Artificial General Intelligence. But, there was an accident... An accident? James is a survivor, so to speak. One day, he suddenly vanished from the house. So, hurry and bring him home. I'll fix him. This is his home. You'll be home soon. Professor Baba's waiting for you. Ride that. We're not doing that. We didn't come here to play. Tang. [Okinawan] So, let us show you the ocean sights... Ken, fish. There are so many. What kind of fish are out there? Blue, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, red. What's your name? Name... Oh... Tang. Ken. Ken... Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang. Blue, red. Lots. That was fun. Are you happy now? Come on, let's go. No. Ride again. Tang. Don't want to go. No. No, no. What are you doing? You're going home; we have to clean you up. Don't just do what you like, listen to what the professor says. No. Go home with Ken! That's not possible. I can't help you. Can! Can't. I can't do anything. Even for my own dad. Dad? I was a medical intern. Do you understand? Medical intern? Peripheral route secured. Crash cart on the way. He's in VT. Dad... Are you okay? Are you okay? Shall I take a blood sample, doctor? Where are the other doctors? They're in the ER. Well then... A shot of heparin. Take his blood pressure. Yes. I'll get the heparin. He's losing consciousness. Then, lidocaine, 100... Which one doctor? -How's his pulse and breathing? -Weak. Which one doctor? Shall we prep him for DC? Prep adrenaline? Ken... Get the crash cart! Hurry! -Bring it here! -Okay! -Blood pressure? -It's 60 over 30. Should we give him adrenaline? Doctor? There's no pulse, he's in VF! Saturation's dropping. Doctor, what should we do? Get the intubation kit! I was scared... I couldn't decide. What are you doing?! Out of the way! Start CPR, now! Call someone else here. Okay. Prepare to intubate! DC! Adrenaline shot! Ultimately, he never recovered. From then on... I lost all faith in myself. I couldn't move forward or take a step back. As for Emi, I just couldn't answer her. Well... I guess the real useless piece of junk here is me. Useless junk? Yeah. Useless junk. Ken is there for Tang. Tang is there for Ken. Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Come on, let's go. Oh... James! Huh? Welcome home. Hmm? Hey, come on Tang. Tang? Oh... it's James, right? You're Kasugai san then? Thank you so much for finding him. Thank you. You must be tired. Come in for some tea. Here, come on. Bio-ethanol. Right. This... is James' fuel. That's the replacement. All done! Hey. That's good. James, come here. Come on James, over here. Who? Well... Can I ask about what happened? Well... about the accident... Go home with Ken. Come here James, come here. Well, this is a bit awkward. He won't even let me examine him. Looks like he's lost his memory. Well, it's almost time for me to, er... Ah, yes. Well then, er, James. No! He can fix you properly. No! It's troublesome to have you around. Not troublesome! You make a fuss, you're badly behaved. Not bad. I'll be good! Okay. Ken! Well then, finally... I can be... rid of him. Well then... Ken! Not... friend? Ken! Hey! Where's the robot? Where's that neurochip? Did you give it to Baba? Yeah, well... Tang is Professor Baba's. Well... I want you to listen carefully. 5 years ago, there was an accident... in the android lab where I worked. Yeah... I heard that Tang was a survivor. James. I'm glad you came back. At the time, our lab's androids were world-leading. On that day there was... a shooting drill. Shooting? Androids were? Secret research was underway into military units intended for export. During the exercise, unexpectedly, one of the androids, James, exhibited fear. The androids were not designed to have that emotion. He had become much more human-like. It was a miracle. Baba didn't stop James from spiralling out of control, which resulted in the unforeseen incident. Baba wanted to keep this miracle to himself, so he stole the neurochip from James... He escaped, and left everything to burn. He's a dangerous man, who'll stop at nothing to further his research. James, the neurochip is everything to me. Another failure? Well... Come here. Let's start over. I need that neurochip. No! James. Publicly, the whole thing was treated as an accident. All research has since been suspended. Baba went missing. We've been searching for that stolen chip for a long time. Finally, we received information on Tang's whereabouts. I apologise for our threatening behaviour. Hey, wait! Hey! Don't do this alone! Hey! Tang! Come out James! Tang! Ken! Tang remembered. Doctor need chip. Tang will be broken. So escaped. Scared, scared! Calm down Tang. We'll leave here together I thought I'd erased his memories, but they still remain. I'm grateful to you. I've been monitoring you for some time. You're even more useless than I thought. Here... throw it! Hurry! Okay! When you work with stupid people, you acquire diverse concepts, which enable you to formulate more sophisticated plans of action. Ta... I'm taking Tang home with me. Tang? There is no such thing. Once all the experiential data is self-organised, all extraneous memories are erased. Then it re-learns again and again. The result of this accumulation... is an ideal future. No... this is the future of mankind. You see, the thing I don't want you to misunderstand is... AI is just a tool to liberate people. So far, people have created wealth by adding value generated through labour. We've taken that limited wealth, and used it to compete with each other. Principles or ideology... whatever the excuse, All wars... are economic wars. But... AI will create infinite wealth. No more wasteful conflict, suffering, or inequality. How can you not see that? Ken! No! Let go! Let go! Tang... Hurry, lets... Ken! Ken okay? Well James, let's clear your memory cache and resume our research. Hmm? I may know nothing about wealth and conflict... but if you do that... Tang will no longer be Tang. It's just a robot. What are you getting so worked up about? Tang is... Ken. ...my precious... friend. Shut up you piece of junk. Worthless people who can't evolve should be eliminated! Stop! Ken... Tang, escape! Hurry! Tang! Tang. Tang. Tang! Hey! Can you hear me? Hey! What is it? He's not moving. I put a new one in and it's not working. Calm down. All right, listen carefully. It could be a power line problem, Check that there are no faulty harnesses. What's a harness? Is there anything wrong with the cable that goes from the battery to the core unit? It's broken off. -Connect it. -How? Don't you have anything? Look around! That'll do. Use that instead of solder. Done it. Right. Plug it into the core unit. Which way round? I don't know. Baba's the only one who'd know that. If you do it in the wrong order, the core unit will short-circuit. Which means... It won't just be his memory; it'll be the whole system. It's all or nothing. Either plug it in... or give up and remove the chip. What should I do? Come on, we're running out of time! What are you going to do?! Tang... is there for Ken. Ken... is there for Tang. Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang, Ken, Tang. Tang. What is it Tang? His memory... was erased? Tang... it's me... Ken. What's wrong? Come on Tang, remember. Come on. Just like you always do... say 'Tang'. Are you gone completely? It can't be true! Tang!! You must be tired. Your name... is Tang. You used to live here. But you got scared of Professor Baba so you ran away... from here. And then... I have no idea how, but you ended up at my house. Tang... Hey! What are you? Found. Tang... found... found... Ken. Tang... love... love... Ken. I love you too, Tang. We'll get the full details back at HQ. As a scientist, I always admired you. But now, I pity you. I will attain it... our ideal future. So, as we've captured Baba, we'll get a promotion when we return, right? Huh? What's this? You're not planning on blaming me again, are you? Huh?! There's no way I'd do that. We're mates. Mates... I'm asking for a transfer when we get back. The chip that's still inside Tang... naturally, we retain ownership. However, if you're willing to join our team, that's a different matter. What's that supposed to mean? If you're willing to look after Tang, to raise him and report back to us, then I'd be very happy for him to stay with you from now on. You've helped Tang to develop into who he is today. For that reason, we'd be happy to have you alongside us. That way, we can continue to collect valuable data. However, I will need your family's consent. Please discuss this with your wife. Tang. What? Let's go home. Yahh! Wahh! I'm home. I'm home. Ohh... Welcome home. The clock... you fixed it. I won't be winding it anymore. Little shit. Wrong. Not this. What are you doing? I'm just unemployed. Not that... Listen up Tang. Now, we can go home together. Tang! But... we won't be able to play like we have been. Why not play? I'm... going to be a doctor. What's doctor? A person who helps people recover, heals them. Heals? Well... heals wounds. Heals... wounds? So... I'm not sure how long it'll take, but one day I'll say to Emi... it's going to be okay. Listen Tang... That's enough. That's enough. Enough! We won't be able to play like we have been. But... in the end, not just someday, but when it counts, I won't run away... I'll keep moving forwards. I'm sorry for everything. I'll have faith in myself again. I'll keep moving. If I can't be with you... it's meaningless. Everything will be alright. You're the one... who brought Ken here. Thank you. Tang. Make sound. Hmm? Heart... two. Two?! That's right. Another person. I wasn't sure whether to tell you. I thought I'd... not tell you and do it alone. But... you're going to be a great dad. Ken. Ah... well... it's nothing. This is just... I'm just leaking. No. Ken... is healing. That's right Tang. You really are... special. Ahh~ Good night Tang. Tang.
