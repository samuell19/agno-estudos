One, you leave your family's contact at the local Red Cross in (indistinct). Two, the Red Cross contacts you and supplies your commanding officer- - Fan mail from Crystal? - Yeah. - [Radio Announcer] And three, the company cuts your orders, and you're on your way, so let's hope- - Come on, hurry up. - (laughing) Okay. - Open the fucking box.

MACV cuts my orders, not the CIA. - Our situation in I Corps is fragile enough without some- - Without what? Without a special forces captain here with a personal vendetta? (dramatic music) - Yeah. (paper rustling) That and the rest of it. (drawer slamming) (footsteps plodding) (chair creaking) (footsteps plodding) We're right up against the DMZ with North Vietnam, here. - Crawford. I can read a fucking map. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) That's the perfect location for the North to start a wholesale invasion on the South. - A North Vietnamese army offensive is imminent here in Quang Tri Province. (Heinrick laughs) - I've been saying that for months. Nothing's happened. - Intelligence from our special forces in Laos says that brigade-sized units have infiltrated through Laos on the Ho Chi Minh Trail last week. (dramatic music continues) - Wasn't supposed to be any special forces in Laos. It's a good thing somebody's still fighting for what's right, not just for what's legal. - That's why we've been bombing all along the trail. - [Heinrick] You ever heard of crabgrass, Crawford? - No. (dramatic music continues) - Well, it's tenacious. You gotta dig it and pull it, but you never really get it all. You have to extract every tiny, invisible little root 'cause, otherwise, the just grows back. - Yes, I suppose so. (feet shuffling) (paper rustling) (dramatic music continues) The NVA's local contact is a Viet Cong province chief. He's holed up somewhere in a free-fire zone. (file thudding) We have intel that his people have been trained to guide the NVA into our bases and into Hue. (match scraping) We find him and identify his cadre, we get a twofer. We disrupt that NVA offensive, dismantle the VC network in Quang Tri. (dramatic music continues) Heinrick, you bring him back. (paper rustling) - You know that's a large area to find someone. - [Crawford] Someone higher up doesn't like you. - Yeah, well. - (sighs) It's all free fire around those hamlets, farmers, all loyal to the North. (dramatic music continues) (bystander speaking indistinctly) - Guess no democracy or the American way for them, huh? - Our ARVN allies have worked over two of his helpers, but we can't get 'em to talk. - Oh, they'll talk.

(boot thudding) - 'Cause Cap'n said he need to have combat experience to get his own company. (blanket rustling) - In other words, he has to get his card punched before he can get a company and make captain? That piece of shit. - Exactly.

(canister thudding) I do not. - [John] I understand. - They keep getting killed or transferred out after a few months in the bush, and now, Lieutenant Holis wants to kill you because you discharged your weapon next to his ear. - First Sergeant, you- - Don't care. Captain would have to court marshal him for killing you, and I lose another junior officer. - [John] But he was- - Don't care. - [Camp Radio Announcer] Battery four, major close. - I also have a shortage of good NCOs, so I can't court martial you because then I'd have privates leading platoons in the field. (saliva sputtering) Do you understand my problem? - First Sergeant, I sensed NVA, platoon sized, in front of us. - [Schott] Sensed? - And Johnny, Sergeant Reese heard a Chicom machine gun bolt click. We needed to pull back and call in arty, but Hairy Hole- - Sensed and needed. This is not a California hippie commune. This is an infantry company. And Alexander, I didn't ask you anything. Alexander, why are you even here? I called for Reese. Fucking Batman and Robin. I should cancel your R&R, and Reese, you should be rotting in the Long Binh Jail.

I went to supply to get HE rounds, and they got zip-a-dee-doo-dah. We better hoping to go in blind, deaf, and stupid during Tet. - [Ian] Somebody fucked up. We have to have a ammo. - Battalion wants you five jokers for a Phoenix mission, grab a VC province official. They think he can lead us to the local VC that are acting as scouts for the NVA. (Ian sighs) - First Sergeant, we're not special forces. That's CIA business. (saliva sputtering) - I know that Alexander, and I don't need you to tell me that. This comes directly from the battalion commander, in other words, from fucking God. Whole world is on leave for Tet, ARVN, half our company. You are it. - What about the Tet truce?

Oh, shit. - You will salute him, call him sir, and you will not let him do anything stupid. (birds chirping) S-3 says the NVA are crossing into Quang Tri Province. Stay on the radio. We will get you out if you run into anything you cannot handle. (Ian sighs) (birds chirping) (footsteps plodding) - Recall the last Tet truce, gentleman?

Johnny, better memorize it. - Got your bubblegum, you ready to go? (paper thudding) - All set, minus the fact that supply said they have no M-60 rounds. - First Sergeant said check under his bed. I'll go get 'em. - Thanks. Thump, you got a canister? - Ah, I'll trade, uh, some your weed for 15 rounds from Trunk Company, boy. (soldiers laughing) - Except for that Phoenix bullshit. We're gonna sneak into some fucking village, grab Charlie, slap his uncle, bring his ass back here.

(crickets chirping) (clothes rustling) (soldiers chattering indistinctly) (birds chirping) - Alexander, you're intuitive. Know what the enemy's up to without even seeing him. It's very useful. And Reese, he can, well, he can smell 'em and hear 'em, uh, like a natural hunter. It's nice, but you can't skate around the fact of killing, can't pick and choose who you're gonna kill just so it makes you feel good. You show mercy, and some farmer with a gun is gonna shoot your boyfriend in the back. I know about the two of you, I know. I do not approve of your situation. - The fuck does that mean? - You two, strutting around advertising whatever the fuck it is you advertise. Army boyfriends, is it? At least have the decency to hide it. - But what are you gonna do, Captain? (gun clicking) - You got your orders for OCS, and I'm gonna have to approve those orders.

What did he say? - He's on a recon patrol, at least 1,000 NVA approaching Quang Tri City and more headed to take Hue, and he says he misses his girlfriend. - I'll bet he does, little fucker. - I'll long Quang Tri. (footsteps plodding) (birds chirping) (lighter clicking) Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two, over. Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two, over. - [Fat Lady One] One, two. - We have one, zero, zero, zero, November, Victor, Alpha approaching Ben Lot from an undisclosed location. At this very moment, we're eight clicks south of Ben Lot. Are helicopters available? - [Fat Lady One] Negative extract, top six. Continue mission, over. - What the fuck? Thanks a fucking lot. (map snapping) (radio clanking) They say thanks for the heads up, no helicopters available. (birds chirping) - The NVA are attacking about here. We wait for dark, cross their line of attack, and get extracted when choppers are available. - [Heinrick] No, we finish our mission. We take away their tour guides to Hue. - (laughs) That's all well and good, sir, if it weren't for a regiment of regular NVA. - We will finish our mission. - Not if it means we all die. We have a prisoner with intel. (Ian breathing heavily) (dramatic music) Hey, he's a POW. (gear clanging) - [Burd] He's right. (POW breathing heavily) - Ian. (gear clanging) (POW whimpering) - [Heinrick] Not so tough. (gun clicking) (POW gasping) (body thudding) - [Burd] It had to be done. (gear clanging) (dramatic music continues) - It's called murder. - I call that leadership. You and your friend here wanna sweat the details. - (sighs) Americans fight by the rules. - You fight by the rules, you will lose this war. (dramatic music continues) - I'm with the captain. Thump, I had to kill the kids they used as shields when they assaulted that hill. - [Thumper] Yes, you had to do that, but that soldier didn't need to be killed. Nah, there's something broken inside the cat. (clothes rustling) - Johnny, he's a psycho (breathing heavily). I have to stop him. - Yeah? How's that gonna look on your record? - I don't know. You love this boy? You wanna go home with him, you gotta do something about this damn cap'n. - He's an officer, okay? He makes the big money. It's his call. - We can't go up against no regiment of NVA. (saliva sputtering) - What? You're in the army. It's dangerous. We follow orders. - Look at me. Look at me when you say some shit like that. This is wrong. (dramatic music continues) No, we need to leave this place, or we gonna end up being paddy manure and for nothing but some Sneaky Pete mission. (footsteps plodding) - Thank you for your loyalty, Sergeant. We move out for Ben Lot to the free-fire zone. (dramatic music continues) - [Thumper] Nah, brother, we don't need this shit. - Heinrick just got us out of a tight situation. - No, you got us out of the tight situation. Heinrick is the kind of officer that gets us all killed. - [John] Yeah, well guess what. We ain't got a fucking choice. Gimme my gun. (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (wind howling) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (gear clanging) - Y'all smell that? - Napalm barbecue. - Burgers, gasoline grill. - Makes me hungry. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) - Jesus. - Just a body. Don't mean anything. (dramatic music continues) Sir. (footsteps plodding) Sir. Sir. (dramatic music continues) Sir. (wind howling) Um, it's a, it's a dog, for God's sake. I don't... - Artillery and clusters. God-blessed horror. (fire crackling) - Looks like they got caught in the open. - Hey, spread out and keep your eyes open. - Efficient work. (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) - Heinrick knows about us? - He needs us. - When he doesn't? - You are thinking about our future. (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) - [Heinrick] NVA hit-list work, settling scores. The closer we get to Hue, the more the bodies will start piling up, (breathing heavily) nurses, priests. (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) - Why did the captain kill him? - [Heinrick] Over here. - [Doc] Hey. (footsteps plodding) Why did you kill him? - [Heinrick] Private, it's not worth it. - [Doc] Huh? - [Heinrick] I don't give the enemies chances. - What about mercy? (fire crackling) (Heinrick breathing heavily) - What about it? (Heinrick breathing heavily) (fire crackling) (debris crumbling) (Heinrick breathing heavily) Okay. (water sloshing) - They were in a hurry, had to move fast before our artillery and gunships caught 'em in the open. (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) (water sloshing) - [Thumper] See? And you was whining about it being too cold (laughs). (dramatic music continues) (water sloshing) (boy slurping) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (John slurping) (John slurping) (footsteps plodding) - Kill him. He's gonna tell his people we're here. (dramatic music continues) - [Ian] They already know we're here. - This guy's cold. - Frozen. - Just arrest him for killing that NVA prisoner. You can do that. CO threatens us all the time with court marshal if we kill prisoners. - Exactly. (footsteps plodding) (barrel thudding) - [Soldier] Whoa. (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) - Four clicks from Ben Lot. - Cap'n, we need water. There's a stream back there. - I'm gonna stay here until dawn, get our boys into Ben Lot, back in time for Alexander's R&R. - If we get into a firefight in that village, the NVA will find us- - Move out. (footsteps plodding) (birds chirping) - (inhales) Ah, it's these socks. Ain't no good. (breathing heavily) Can't keep 'em dry. - Thump. (socks thudding) - Hmm. (birds chirping) (water flowing) (gear clanging) - Boys, NVA and VC are attacking all over the country, Quang Tri, Dong Ha, Hue, all under attack. VC sappers have taken control of the embassy in Saigon, no helicopters or artillery in sight. (water flowing) (sighs) Fuck. (birds chirping) - Burd. (water flowing) (birds chirping) (footsteps plodding) (water flowing) (clothes rustling) (gun clinking) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) Why can't we be a family? - Queers don't have families. - Well, why not? - 'Cause they're queers. That's all we'll ever be. (dramatic music continues) - No, we'd be a real family, (exhales) you and me. - My uncle never married, lived with a man on a farm. They raised Labrador dogs. People always tried to run 'em out. (dramatic music continues) Finally, the neighbors shot the dogs, and my uncle left. I never saw him again. (dramatic music continues) (gun thudding) (clothes rustling) Promise me you'll leave when I say to. Please. (dramatic music continues) - We'll arrest Heinrick and bring him back for trial. (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (Heinrick sniffing) (clothes rustling) (airplane humming) (helicopter whirring) - [Ian] Day number three. - Third day of what? - Third day out, like the monk said, peril. - Every day is a freaking day of peril out here. (metal clanking) - That's our guy. He's a dead man. They're all VC. - Our orders are to bring him back alive for questioning. - The man's VC. Family's VC. They're all fucking VC. - Let's do this job quickly and get it done. Alexander, use that 60 on the main group. (dramatic music continues) The rest of you, kill anybody who tries to escape, and then we burn the village down. - We do it quick, and we go home, guys. Captain's right. - (exhales) No. This stops here. (dramatic music continues) (Ian breathing heavily) (Ian breathing heavily) Heinrick. (dramatic music continues) You are under arrest for the killing of an unarmed prisoner and for the illegal order to kill civilians. - You guys think these people are civilians? (footsteps plodding) Let's get the job done. (footsteps plodding) - Sarge, they're VC. You know they are. - You're finished, Heinrick. (dramatic music continues) (gear clanging) (bag thudding) (button clicking) (gun thudding) (Heinrick laughs) (leaves crunching) - You know, Reese, he's made you soft. (dramatic music continues) - Go fuck yourself. (hand thudding) - You're not gonna shoot me. You're too good of a soldier. (gun clanking) (head thudding) (Heinrick grunting) (footsteps plodding) (gear clanging) (soldiers grunting) (body thudding) (John groaning) (body thudding) (soldiers grunting) (fist thudding) (soldiers grunting) (revolver clanking) (revolver thudding) (soldiers breathing heavily) - Are you okay? (soldiers breathing heavily) (clothes rustling) (saliva sputtering) (soldiers breathing heavily) (cigarettes thudding) (soldiers breathing heavily) (feet shuffling) - Captain is my prisoner. (Ian breathing heavily) None of you had anything to do with this. - (scoffs) Really? (hand patting) I just knocked him out cold. I mean, is that... (hands patting) - The ghoulies. (footsteps plodding) - [John] Where? (footsteps plodding) (gear clanging) (gear clanging) (gear clanging) (birds chirping) (gear clanging) (birds chirping) (leaves crunching) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) - There goes our escape route. - Yep. (binoculars clanking) - Two forces are doing a meetup. (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (birds chirping) Looks like court's in session. - We think he works for them. They think he works for us. - Perfect. The NVA will do the job for us. (Heinrick laughing) - Shut up, or I'll gag you. (birds chirping) Our mission is to grab the official and disrupt their plans. - Fuck the mission. (exhales) Let's get out of here. - We can attack, or we can run. There's no good choice. We move into that village, we're exposed. We hide in the trees, we're caught. - We attack, at least we have the initiative. We get our man and maybe shock the NVA into hesitating. We get a head start for the LZ. I won't order you. - Okay. Maybe, if we do this together, we can get outta here. - Jesus H. Christ on a pogo stick, and the whole NVA fucking army is out there within shouting distance. Let's just leave. (birds chirping) I'm not doing this. Fuck. (clothes rustling) - Johnny, we'll come with the sun at our backs. They're supporting unit in the trees won't know what they're dealing with. - (sighs) I don't know (sighs). - They're on both sides of us. They just don't know we're here. - You guys are so cute. - Shut the fuck up. - [Fat Lady One] Rover Two, Fat Lady One, sit-rep, over. - We're going to our prisoner, and then we'll go to LZ X-ray for extraction. We'll pop smoke. (static buzzing) - [Fat Lady One] Lima Charlie, over. - Fire support available? - [Fat Lady One] Negative, any kind, a real Charlie foxtrot- - God. - all the way up north, snakes, too. Keep defending base. You're on your own, brother. - Look, John, we grab him and then get to the LZ X-ray, okay? (Ian sighs) - You really think I could let you go alone? (dramatic music continues) (leaves crunching) - Okay, here we go. Burd, make sure the captain is properly secured. (sighs) Do it right. - Wanna be a hero, Sarge? (footsteps plodding) They die young. You know, a lot has to go right with your plan. (dramatic music continues) - Yep. - Tommy. (leaves rustling) (gear clanging) You're the best shot. Get an angle on the woman officer. When you drop her, we attack, okay? (hand patting) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (leaves rustling) (dramatic music continues) - Use the heavy artillery in front of our advance. Use it all. They'll think it's mortars. Bring the prisoner here and cover for us. (Thumper sighs) (button clicking) (hand patting) (footsteps plodding) 300 rounds. - Come left, right at the NVA in the open. Avoid the village. I'll grab the prisoner, okay? Let's move. (grass rustling) (dramatic music continues) (grass rustling) (metal clinking) (dramatic music continues) - White, you don't have to do this. Vietnamese politics, just let 'em handle it. We go back to Quang Tri City together, stay alive. - Sometimes you be making the most sense, Cap'n. (feet shuffling) (leaves crunching) Just so you know, I love those boys with my whole heart. I'm not sure who you care about. (Thumper exhaling) - They're dead. - Who's dead? - My wife. My son. Both Vietnamese. - I'm sorry for your loss. (clothes rustling) (lips smacking) (Thumper exhaling) (clothes rustling) Why didn't you go home? What kept you here? Why didn't you leave this evil damn place? (dramatic music continues) - What do you care? (cigarette thudding) (Heinrick laughing) (Heinrick sniffing) (dramatic music continues) (gear clanging) (dramatic music continues) (gear clanging) (dramatic music continues) (gear clanging) (gun clinking) (helmet thudding) (Ian breathing heavily) (dramatic music continues) (Ian breathing heavily) (birds chirping) (Ian breathing heavily) (metal clinking) (Ian breathing heavily) (dramatic music continues) (gun clanking) (gunshot blasting) (casing clinking) (gunshots blasting) (soldiers yelling indistinctly) - [Ian] Run.

(Thumper gasping) Oh, you motherfucker. (Thumper gasping) (Thumper yelling) (Thumper gasping) - Sorry, Thump. (Thumper gasping) (Thumper gasping) (Heinrick breathing heavily) (body thudding) (dramatic music continues) (clothes rustling) (hand patting) (leaves crunching) (footsteps plodding) (gear clanging) (dramatic music continues) (gunshots blasting) (water sloshing) (mortar exploding) (gunshots blasting) (mortar exploding) (bullets whizzing) (mortar exploding) (gunshots blasting) (soldier grunting) (gunshots blasting) (gunshots blasting) - [Soldier] Hey, hey, hey, hey (bombs drowning out speaker).

Burd, pick up Thump and get back to the LZ. (gunshot blasting) (John groaning) (gun thudding) (mortars exploding) (John groaning) (mortar exploding) (bullets whizzing) - [Soldier] We gotta move. They'll come in force. (mortar exploding) (gunshots blasting) (mortar exploding) (water sloshing) (soldier grunting) (gunshots blasting) (mortars exploding) (dramatic music continues) (mortars exploding) (footsteps plodding) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (gear clanging) (container rattling) (Heinrick sniffing) (energetic music) A picture of you and me in the jungle. (footsteps plodding) - [Doc] Thumper, we need cover fire (grunting). (body thudding) (Doc groaning) (gunshots blasting) What's wrong? - [Soldier] Go, I got it, go. - Thump, what's wrong? You okay? (gunshots blasting) (Doc breathing heavily) (Thumper grunting) Okay, get up, get up. - [Soldier] I need ammo. Fucking get- - [Doc] Fucking get up. (John groaning) (mortar exploding) - [Doc] Dammit. We need this off, Sarge. (John groaning) - [Soldier] Fucking Christ. - [Doc] Not now, we don't have time, we don't have time. - [Soldier] What? (gunshots blasting) (John breathing heavily) - Where the fuck is Heinrick? - Creepy bastard got loose, snuck up on me. (dramatic music) - No trails. We break through their lines to the LZ- - [Soldier] You could give him a- - go to the river, cross it, and hold there. - Gimme five seconds. I just need five seconds. - [Soldier] Burd, you got radio? - [Burd] Yeah, radio set. (dramatic music continues) - Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two. Fat Lady One, this is Rover Two, (gunshots blasting) in route to LZ X-ray, three WIA for extract, (gunshots blasting) please advise. - [Fat Lady One] Two, one. - [John] I'm sorry. - Confirm contact. - Hey, hey, don't apologize. We're both surviving this. (both breathing heavily) We gotta go. - No, we, we go back to the way we came. - No, no trails. Guys, we gotta move. - Well, you, you heard the man, let's fucking go. - [Soldier] Get outta here. (soldier grunting) - [Soldier] Yeah? (soldier grunting) (dramatic music continues) (soldier grunting) (leaves rustling) (footsteps plodding) (gunshots blasting) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (body thudding) (leaves rustling) (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (water sloshing) (dramatic music continues) (dark rock music begins) - I'm sorry.

They're withdrawing. Good dose of artillery fire does it every time. - You caused it. - War caused this. Everybody wants to talk about the elephant, but when it hurts us, well, (laughs) you're gonna miss this when it's gone. - If anyone deserved to be killed back there, it was you. (Heinrick laughs) - You and me, we're the same. We love this. (hand patting) (Ian groaning) - Fuck off. (fist thudding) (Heinrick groaning) (Ian breathing heavily) (saliva sputtering) (dramatic music continues) (helicopter whirring) - Lights out, inbound, landing north, east side, pop it.

(gunshots blasting) - You did, you did good, angel. - No. - I, take, take me to the rice paddy. You know the one. And put me in the water, (Ian sobbing) in the water. I'll be at peace there. (Ian breathing heavily) - Johnny. Johnny, no. - I always, (dog tags rattling) I always tried to do the right thing. - You did. - But all, all I ever, all I ever wanted was you. (Ian sobbing) - Johnny, you have me. (Johnny groaning) No, Johnny. (dog tags rattling) (Ian sobbing) (dramatic music continues) (clothes rustling) (Ian sobbing) (Ian sobbing) (dramatic music continues) (Ian sobbing) (gunshots blasting) - Sorry about Reese. He was a good soldier. (gunshots blasting) Such a beautiful country. Listen, it went like this. We found the VC leader, he resisted, we killed him in a firefight. (gunshots blasting) Stick to my story, and all will be well. (gunshots blasting) We gave our fire base warning of the attack. Good stuff. And Reesey'll get a medal. (dramatic music continues) - (sobbing) A medal? (gunshots blasting) - Listen, just don't say anything about what happened, okay? They'll make you an officer. (gunshots blasting) (dramatic music continues) - [Ian] Motherfucking bastard. (gunshots blasting) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music continues) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music continues) (helicopter whirring) (helicopter whirring) (feet shuffling) - He was my friend, too. Two NVA regiments were delayed by your action. (helicopter whistling) Gave us time. Even then it was a close thing. Nice work. Tell me what went down. - First Sergeant, (dramatic music) we got to the village, and it was the wrong guy. Kept us going through the forests, and NVA were picking us off. First, we lost Burd, Thumper, went back, tried to find him, and practically stepped on him on the path. (birds chirping) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (feet shuffling) (dramatic music continues) (Ian breathing heavily) (dramatic music continues) (Ian breathing heavily) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (footsteps plodding) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) - This will end your career. (helicopter whirring) No one is asking about you and John. Just don't tell 'em. - I've had enough of being quiet. (Schott sighs) - This will not fly at battalion. They'll want to give you all medals. They'll promote that rat fuck Heinrick. (helicopter whirring) Did he, did he really try to kiss? Ian. John would not want this. (Ian exhales) - Johnny always said I couldn't shut up, but I can't keep quiet. (exhales) not anymore (sniffs). (feet shuffling) (footsteps plodding) (Ian breathing heavily) (helicopter buzzing) - [Schott] Queer sergeants in love just sounds like porno to me. (Ian breathing heavily) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) (Ian sniffing) (body bag zipping) (canvas rustling) (Ian breathing heavily) (helicopters whirring) (body bag zipping) (dramatic music continues) (feet shuffling) - The hell is this? - My after-action report, sir. - I know that, Goddammit. - I can explain. - Shut up, Captain. Did you kill a prisoner, and did you order the killing of women and children and the burning of the village? Is the rest true? - Yes, sir. (footsteps plodding) (commander sighs) - Your attack on the village delayed and disrupted the 812th regiment of the NVA. They were amassing to overrun our base on Dong Ha. They were to rendezvous in that village. Instead they chased you, got themselves lost. That's what led to their defeat here, and the NVA were successful in Hue. They still hold the Citadel. I have orders to remove them. (papers rustling) Your after-action report on the battle of Dong Ha, (papers thudding) lost. Sergeant Alexander, you are promoted to the rank of second lieutenant and ordered to the city of Hue to take command of the Third Platoon, B Company. Do you accept your commission and your orders? - Yes, sir. (dramatic music) - Pride, bring me second lieutenant bars. - I want Sergeant Reese's ashes. (footsteps plodding) - You do have the balls to lead a rifle platoon. Pride, Lieutenant Alexander has been appointed with the proper disposition of Sergeant Reese's remains. See to it. (dramatic music continues) (fingers tapping) (door thudding) (fingers tapping) Captain Heinrick. (feet shuffling) - Take a seat. I'll type your orders. - In lieu of court marshal proceedings for behavior unbecoming of an officer, you will resign your commission and leave for the United States to be given a general discharge. Dismissed. (dramatic music continues) (door thudding) (dramatic music continues) (Heinrick breathing heavily) (dramatic music continues) (fingers tapping) (dramatic music continues) (chair creaking) (footsteps plodding) (fingers tapping) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (gunshot blasting) (door thudding) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (footsteps plodding) - Lieutenant. I'd appreciate if you help me box up Reese's stuff. I know how close you were to him. (clothes rustling) (birds chirping) (box clanking) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (chain clinking) (dog whimpering and barking) - That belongs to the captain. (dramatic music continues) (dog whimpering and barking) - Heinrick, goddamn you. (dramatic music continues) Come on. (birds chirping) (dramatic music continues) (Ian sighs) You're gonna miss when it's gone. (birds chirping) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) (dramatic music continues) I love you, Johnny. I always will. (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues)
