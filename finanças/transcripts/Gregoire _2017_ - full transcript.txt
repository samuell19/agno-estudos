When we were kids, our mom made us write a letter to one another... and told us we weren't allowed to open it for 10 years. We were fighting at the time, and I was mad at him because he broke my roller blades. We were eight. She has the letters buried somewhere, with the rest of our shit from when we were kids... I think. She works a lot. But we still have pizza and movie nights every now and then. We used to do them every week when we were a family, but now it's... whenever. Hey, I got it. This one's going to be really simple. They always keep their back door open for deliveries, right. So, we're going in, use door stoppers to keep it shut from the inside. Once we get what we want, we'll just take off through this door here, exit to the field. - There's an entrance here, why don't we just go out here, it'll be way quicker. - Doesn't matter, you go out that way. I'll go out that way. - You think you're faster than me? - I know I'm faster than you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - First one around the track, bitch! Bitch! - Fuck you! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! Stay the fuck back. Come here, Louis, give me a hug. - Head down, you immigrant fuck! - Empty the fucking register, now! - Say one fucking word and we'll report your ass and get you sent back to whatever fucking shit hole, you motherfucker. - Hurry the fuck up! - That's fucking it? Let's go! - Get going! - Keep your fucking mouth shut! Fuck! Shut the fuck up! We started without you, pizza's getting cold. - Hmm. The love of Clay's life died at a house party a couple of years ago. She took some prescription drugs and mixed it with booze. Choked on her own puke while Clay was passed out next to her. I can tell he always thinks about it. Sometimes he wakes me up in the night just to make sure I'm still breathing. We argued about what happens when you die. I think when you die, you get a memorial page made, and people like it. Over the years, less and less people will post about it till you're completely forgotten. We were together for seven months. He was always so sad. I unliked her page this morning. - Morning. - Morning! - Float's been counted already. - Oh? Is Aubrey here already? - Aubrey isn't even here yet. I did it. - Okay. Um... so what's going on, what's the scoop then? - Uh, I think we should focus on returns, - and keeping the store clean. - Mm-hmm. - All that bullshit, same old stuff. - Yeah, what else? - Uh, what am I missing? - Hmm... pushing the sales, spring's out the door, 2-for-1 we gotta start making room for some of this summer shit that we're getting in. - Right. - Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Devin and I hung out. - Oooh! - Shut up! - So, uh, how long have you two been together? - I wouldn't say "together". - Hmm. - Well, I thought you guys were dating? - We've gone on dates. - Hmm-huh. - Yeah. - Morning, girls. - Hey! - Hey! - Morning! - Do you think we're doing reviews today? - I don't know. Last year took like a month to do. - Yeah, season change really slows things down. - How much did you make last year? - Huh... three bucks. - Yeah but, she's fucking teacher's pet, so. No, but, if I were a betting man, I'd say that you're next in line for something big. I mean, you're already training everyone already. I'll quit if I don't get three bucks this year. I don't know how they expect us to make a living off of $16 an hour. - You don't pay rent. - How does that mean that I don't need more money? - Okay, look, all I'm saying is I've had to pay rent ever since I've gotten a job. Just saying. - If you're late, do you get a notice or something? - No, actually, now my parents have access to my account, so they basically control it. Every pay day, they take whatever I make, throw it into savings, and then I get an allowance of whatever I make. Does that answer your question? - So crazy. But you must have a bunch of money saved up? - Well, yeah, they have money saved up for me. But I don't get it 'til I'm responsible enough. Misha, can you come here, please? - Coming. So you've been with us for two years now. So this isn't your first review, you know how these things go. We'll go over your overall performance, and see where you rank yourself, and discuss where I think you are in your current stage with us. - Okay. - Before we begin, it's important to know that whatever is said in this room stays in this room. - Right. - Shall we continue? - Yeah. - First section is attendance. I mean, you've been here when we needed you. There was that one issue with sick days but we figured that out. And moving onward, for overall performance, you ranked yourself as "exceeds expectations". Just to define, so we're clear. Uh, this means a combination of things. Mostly how the customer perceives you when they come into the store. Are you personable, are you friendly, how's your knowledge, that sort of thing. Do you still think you fall under that category? - Yeah, for sure. - Okay, this year, I've received more customer complaints than any other year since I started this job, and most of those complaints can be tied back to you. I'm just going to come right out and say it, this has been a pretty big down-year for you. I don't know what it is, but, there are a lot of areas that need improvement. I'm going to put your future in your hands. There are two options, and I want to hear your answer by the end of the week. You can either take no pay raise for the next year or you can quit. You will not be terminated, or laid off, it's completely up to you how you want to proceed. I mean, I should mention to you that if this was anyone but you, they would be fired, I'm only giving you this opportunity because we've been a team for so long. Think about it. Get back to me. - Let's go! - Lex! I have the keys. - Come on, Mish. - Hold on. - Let's go, boys! Go ahead, motherfucker! - What are you looking at? - Fuck you, Carson, you're a bitch. - Two hundred bucks, I'll take this guy? - Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, we'll take this guy, 500 bucks, let's go. - Alright. - Fuck yeah, nah, it's good, man, trust me, this guy's fucking tough, man, I've seen him fight before. It's good. - Look, how shook he looks! - Who's shook? - We got this, man, we got this. - Come on. - There you go, there you go! - That's it, buddy. - Hit him. - Push, fucking savage! Go, man! - I wanna see blood, motherfucker! - There you go, there you go! - Come on! - There you go, he's done, he's done! - Get the fuck up! - Get up, man! - That's what's up, boys, that's what's up. - Let's go, let's go, come on! Finish him! Fuck. Oh, shit, fuck! Cops, cops, cops, cops! - Go, go, go, go, go! - Get him! Get him! - Oh fuck, oh fuck, the fuck! What the fuck man, fuck you! Oh, fuck! - You good? You good? Come on, come on, we gotta get up. Come on, cops are coming. - Come on, get the fuck! - The fuck happened? It's not his either. His parents, they should have known better than having him. - I just want more for you. You know? You're such a good friend. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Is that Devin? - Oh, my god. - Holy shit. Devin! Devin! - Go! - Holy fuck, what's going on! - Andy or Adam or whoever was fighting that fucking kid who used to go to Merc. - Did he win? - Uh... he got laid out. Cops came, everybody started running. - This one night at work, there was this huge fight just outside. This one guy lost his jacket, I think his name was Peter, and this other guy took it while he was changing or trying something on. Anyway, Peter grabs him in the middle of the mall, tells him to give him back his jacket. This guy says he doesn't have a fucking clue where it is, meanwhile his buddy has it behind him. So, Peter grabs the guy by the fucking throat, tells him, "Give it back to me, or else I can't be responsible for what I do". This guy laughs in his fucking face, so Peter punches him right in the face, gushed up his nose, BOOM, right to the ground. "Give me back my coat". Then he punched him, "Give me back my coat", then he punched him again. Finally, this guy, fucking covered in blood, tells his buddy to give him back his coat. - Jesus Christ! - Peter comes into the store and asks to use the phone. Turns out he's got like two G's cash in his pocket, and like, a bunch of coke. Fucking would have never thought that guy was a fighter. Skinny, like lanky, this other guy - jacked. - Yeah, well, one-on-ones never happen anymore. Somebody jumps in, somebody's got a knife, it's fucking stupid. - Uh, do you want a ride somewhere? - Yeah, home would be great if it's not too far out of your way. - It's fine, we got shit all to do now, anyway. - Yeah. - Aren't y'all supposed to be at work? - Got the can, kicked to the fucking curb. - For real? - Yeah. Loyalty means nothing these days. - Money does, you should know that. Cash rules everything, there will always be someone willing to make less money than you, and then there will be someone willing to make less than them. It's the circle of life or some shit. - You guys want to come in for a bit? - Sure. - Cool. - We'll leave soon, I promise. - Okay. - When was the last time you just went out and scoured the streets for trouble? Eh? Like just go and break something, just to do it. You guys are an inside generation, you know what I mean? You live indoors, I swear. Fellow that I work with, he went to put his kids in Little League, and I tell ya what, they didn't have enough players to fill one single team. That's 'cuz nobody's doing anything anymore, you know. Like, when I was your age, I mean, we'd go out and fucking egg houses, you know, for fun. We'd just meet up and walk around, you know. When was the last time you just went and walked around? - Fuck, you're so old, Steve. - I feel bad for you guys, you know, I do. - Steve, you work out at the plant? - Yup. What? Oh, this? You only get in trouble if you get tested, and you only get tested on your first day and if you have an accident. - Have you ever been in an accident? - Oh, yeah. I got sent to rehab, twice. - And you still have your job? - Oh, fuck, yeah. I'll tell ya, they'd rather put the time into rehabilitating me than give the job to some nigger who can't speak a lick of English, you know. Fucking fresh into town cuz his cab buddies told him he can make all kinds of money up here, fuck. Fuck, when I found this guy, he had a backpack of clothes and he was hitchhiking on the fucking Coquihalla. - So, you ever gonna get your shit? - Nah. I didn't have much anyway. Fuck it. My life's here now, I owe this guy for that. - Gave you a fucking ride, place to stay, some fuckin' spending money. It's like I'm your old man! - Yeah, okay, pops. - And you're okay with having this freeloader just hanging around? - Oh, yeah. I mean, I make more money than I know what to do with, eh. He's nice. Nice to have some company sometime. He's a good kid. There's perks to having him around, you know? - I'm okay, thanks. - You sure? - Okay. - Hey. Everything okay? - Yeah, I just wanna leave soon. Weed makes me sleepy, I don't wanna fall asleep here. - Okay. Soon, I promise. - Hey, Alexa, let me show you something. - I'll be a sec. - Just hurry, or I'll leave without you. - Hey... come have a sit. - It's a nice spot you got here. - Ah... yeah, it's alright. - It's your own, at least you can call it that. - This place? No, no, no. Someone else owns it, I just rent 'er. - Oh. - So, you born here or...? - Born and raised. How 'bout you, where are you from? - I'm from here. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No. - What are you asking me? - Where's your hometown? - This is my home. - No, there's a difference. - What's the difference? - Where were you born? Where were you born? - I was born in DC. Where the good stuff grows. Holy fuck, my manners, sorry, there. There you go. Yeah. Just uh... Until the price of oil goes down considerably, this is my home. I'm from here now. I used to have a woman and a kid back in DC, but, things between me and the missus went sour and she didn't like me coming and going all the time, leaving her on her own. And the kid... uh... the boy... well, I hardly know him. My shift, it switches, it's 21 on, seven off, and it's pretty easy to figure out I chose to stay here, you know. Work my ass off so my boy can have a good life. - How old is he? - That's not important. You know, Devin's not from around here either. - Mmm-hmm. - Well, one night, I was driving back down from... - Yeah, you were saying? - Oh, I was too. I gotta... I gotta put this down. I gotta put this thing down. - Do you miss your kid? - That's a stupid question, of course I do. But fuck, if we're being honest, sometimes I don't-- I don't even think about him. That doesn't make me a bad guy, does it, I mean? - When was the last time you saw him? - Three months ago, four months ago? I took him into the woods, taught him to shoot. You know, line up cans on the fence, take turns shooting 'em down. You know... you know, I like to think I'm a pretty simple guy, you know. I go to work, I come home. I have a little toke. I get to relax. You know, I make enough money to take care of my life, cover my life, you know, pay for all, everything... and those around me. I'm a good guy. You know, when I met Devin, he had nobody. I mean, nobody. I mean, at least my boy's got his mom, he's got a pretty decent fellow for a father figure, he's got me, now and then. How well do you know Devin? - Somewhat. - Is he a good kid? - Well... As good as anybody with no supervision, money, no job. He's no place to be. - Hmm. Where's your place to be? - I don't know. Here, I guess. - Here? What's here? - Work and stuff. - Work and stuff, Jesus Christ! Whole life's not all about work, at your age. Are you going... are you going to school, are you getting an education or what? - It's just, it's not for me. - Listen, I'mma tell you something, okay. This town is... it's a well-manicured hand, okay. It's got its nails all done up, nice and pretty, lots of different little colors, okay. - Okay. - And in that hand, there is a fork, okay? - Okay. - On the end of that fork there's a piece of steak, and it's not-- fuck, it's fucking filet mignon, okay. And when you got your mouth open, you fucking take a bite out of that steak. You bite the steak, you don't bite the fork and you certainly don't bite the fucking hand, you understand? Cuz you don't want to starve, right? - That's right. - Eh! - Yeah, I guess. It's just, it's not for me. Oh! - I'm not interested in anything I might do for the rest of my life. - You think I fucking like putting up scaffolding all day? You think that's something I've been dreaming about since I was that big? Jesus Christ! If it weren't for this town that gives to guys like me, I wouldn't have the brains to do nothing else. - Where's the bathroom? - It's the second door on the right there. - Oh, hey now, pour yourself a glass, you're not an animal. - Hey, you ready to go? - Yeah. - Hey, take care of yourself, eh? - Yeah, you too. - Fuck 'em! You fucking asshole! - He knows all about it. Everyone's in on it. Everybody saw it. - You had to share the pizza with everybody, "I'll give you a slice if you don't say anything." He could probably smell it on me. - Yeah, on your breath. - I ate that slice of pizza! What the fuck is the matter with you two? - We're so sorry, Mom. I can't keep leaving work to deal with your shit. Are you going to tell me what happened? - The cops told you. - No, yeah, well, I wanna hear you tell me. - We were just watching these two kids fight, that's it. - Watching? Does this look like watching? - We were watching, then some guy just suckered him. - Who? - Some guy. - Who? - Just some guy. I don't know, he just came up and punched him. - You two need to smarten the fuck up. I can't keep leaving work. You understand that, right. The roof over your head, the food in your gut, it's cuz I work. - You didn't have to leave work. - People fight all the time, it's not a big deal. So, it's okay to just spend the day in jail for some juvenile bullshit? - That's not what I meant. I can't do this on my own. I can't. I need your help. What's the plan, I'd love to know? - I don't know, get jobs with you? - That's what everybody does around here, right? - Get jobs with me? - Yeah. I figured we'd always just work on at the plant with you. - Yeah, well, it's not that simple anymore. When I started, it was nothing. You didn't even need to graduate, they just needed bodies. Hell, I only have my Grade Ten. Then people came from all over the world to get a little piece of that pie, and if you don't have a work ethic, I can't help you. There are a million-and-one people more qualified for this job than you, especially if you don't work for it. I know you guys don't ask me for money, I don't wanna know how you get it. But you are never ever going to have a good life unless you learn how to work for it. - Unless you died, right? - Is that your plan? Just fucking wait till I die? - Don't be such a bitch, you know what he meant. - Shut up, man. - You know what, get out. No, I'm serious. Get up. Get out. Get out of my house, get your things. - C'mon... what... - Go! - Come on. - What do you want us to do? I want you to pack your bags, then I want you to find somewhere else that will put up with your bullshit. Whoa, hey, keys. You want to live under this roof? - Yeah. - What if we pay rent? - Alright. Heat, hot water, electricity, food, for two people. Thousand bucks. Good luck finding that somewhere else. - Come on, you know we don't have that. - You guys want to live under this roof, things are going to have to change. I gotta go to work. - Fucker. - This one's mine! Move. Fuck. - Pussy. - This sucks. This sucks, yeah. - Let's go home. - Well, think we should probably start by giving her this. "Hey, we've been saving allowance and shit," should be good for the first month. - How much do we have? Not even close. - Don't worry about it, she's not going to throw us out. We just gotta stay out of trouble. - Sounded pretty serious to me. - She's mad because she had to come home from work. I don't know how your fucking ears work, but that's not what she said. - So, what do you wanna do, man? You wanna go get a job? I'm not pumped about working. - Alright then. - Maybe we should just think about it, better safe than sorry, you know. - Better safe than sorry, you know. - Here, stick out your hand. - Yup. - One, two, three. - You know what's funny? - Huh. - We woulda had enough for rent if you just shut your mouth with Carson. - I'll fuck you up, man. - Bring it. What's up, buddy, you feeling strong today or what? Feeling strong today, huh? - You just fucking slap me? Fucking bitch! I should cut your fucking teeth you little punk. Fuck off! You fucking slap me, motherfucker? Fucking wanna get cracked in the fuck mouth, - you little bitch. - Fuck yourself, man. Fuck off me. Fucking take it too far. Pussy. Fuck! Sixty... 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... four, three... two... one. God, I fucking hated high school. We got creamed in Grade Nine, real bad. Bunch of us went to the store. Felix thought we could get back without getting frost. - How far'd you get? - Made it to the store. But we didn't make it back. Ran into a bunch of 12th graders. They chased us 'til we were pretty much cornered by the bus depot. I got shaving creamed, eggs shoved in our pockets and smashed. They poured a full two-liter of milk down the front of my pants. I'm serious! Reeked like rotting dairy the rest of the day. What about you? - Alexa was friends with a bunch of the older guys, so we got off pretty easy. Couple of nines drawn on our cheeks, big cock drawn on my arm in permanent marker. Lasted for a whole week. Fuck, my mom was pissed. - They drew dicks on our faces. - I didn't hate it here. I loved it. I loved getting to see my friends every day. Every year, Alexa and I would sign up for woodworking, welding, or automotive. And we'd ditch the class and try to get cosmetology. Of course, it'd be full by then, so we got spares instead. We'd hang out, or whatever. One year, we signed up for woodworking, and they wouldn't let her ditch the class because she needed the credits, or she'd fail. I used to go by the window and watch her try to operate a fucking saw or some shit, can you imagine? No. - Yeah. She didn't talk to me for like two weeks because of it. - Really? - Yeah. Oh yeah, she's like that. Do her wrong, and she'll find a way to punish you for it. Yeah, those two weeks sucked. She's my only friend, you know? But I hung out in the library. That's where I met Clay. So, I guess it wasn't all bad. - Where is he, anyway? - Doesn't go out much. - You remember how we met? - No. - Neither do I. It's funny, you know. I can think about pretty much everybody I know, and how we met, but with you, it's like, all of a sudden, we're just there. Already friends, already knew each other, you know? - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - Do you like me? Huh? Tell me you like me. Thank you for calling Dr. Morgan's office. How may I help you? - Um, hey, I, I was hoping that I could make an appointment to get into your clinic... as soon as possible, if possible. Okay, let me see. How does Saturday at 3:30 PM sound? - It works for me. Alright, can I get your name? - Misha Patton, P-A-T-T-O-N. Okay, and your date of birth? - January 21st, '95. We require a safe phone number just in case we need to contact you ahead of the appointment. Is this a private and safe phone number? - Yeah, you can use this number. Okay, Misha, I just have to ask you a couple of questions. - Okay. What was the date of first day of your last normal menstrual cycle? I'm not 100% sure. That's okay, that's okay. An intake counselor can help you with that when you come in. Okay. Have you had any previous pregnancies or miscarriages? No. Okay, do you have any allergies? Dogs. Do you have any reactions to medications, anesthetics, or latex? No. Do you have any health or medical problems? Uh, no. Are you currently on any medications? Not prescription, no. Do you happen to have a blood test or get an ultrasound done? Uh... You're the first person I'm talking to about it. That's okay. Do you have any questions, Misha? How long will it take? Well, the procedure itself is only about five minutes or so, but be prepared to spend two to three hours for your entire appointment. And how much is it? The procedure costs $500 with applicable taxes. We take all kinds of payment options except check. Okay? - Okay. We've got you scheduled for Saturday. - Yeah, thank you. And don't forget to bring somebody with you so you have a safe ride home. - Okay. Okay, thanks for calling Dr. Morgan. Hey, can I get a ticket to Edmonton for Saturday, please? Yup. What time, 6:00 AM, 12:00 PM, or 3:00 PM? - Six, please. Okay. And who's the ticket for? - Misha Patton. Okay. - P-A-T-T-O-N. Direct to Edmonton, that'll be $71. - Debit, please. - Okay. Shit! Uh... It says insufficient funds. Well, you don't have to pay now. We have your name, so if you just come back on the day, we'll hold your reservation for you. - Um... I can hold it. - Yeah, so I can just, I can just come back the morning of and pay? Yeah, absolutely. I have your name, Patton, so. No problem. - Okay, cool. So that's it? Yup. - Thanks. - See you. - Hey! Hey, Mish. Sorry we haven't checked in for a couple of days. - It's fine, how's it going down there? It's good. Dad went golfing today. I went to the spa. It was so nice. Nice. I don't think your father wants to leave. How's work going? - Uh, same old. Okay, well, uh... there's not much else to report on this end. I just wanted to call and check in. - Mom? I love you, we'll see you soon. - Mom? What? - Can you please transfer some money into my account. I need some. I told you not to be spending all your money on eating out. There's enough food in the fridge, you don't have to be going out every night to eat. - Nah, I wasn't, just like for gas and stuff. I don't know. You can take the bus if you need to get around, you know. Maybe one of your friends can drive you around instead of you driving them around all the time. Have you ever thought about asking them for gas money once in a while? - Whatever, I fucking worked for it, okay. If I wanna spend it on whatever I want, I should be able to. I'm not a fucking child anymore. Mish, no. I'm not putting anymore money... - Misha? - Hey, you mind if I sit? - Please. - So, I know things have been ridiculous the past few days, er, the other day, and I just want you to know that I think I made my decision on the review and... - Sorry, Mish. But you have to understand. I mean, I gave you two options, staying or going, and you walked right out of here. I haven't even heard from you since; so I assumed you were done. - I do understand that I overreacted, and it was childish. - Okay, how about this? Come back at the end of the summer, and we'll see if we have something for you. - Thanks, Aubrey. - Hey. - Yeah. - Come check this out. - What's this? - I think we got the next two spots we're gonna hit. - Yeah? - Yeah. We'll have to scope it out first but... I'm gonna get water, you want something? - Nah, I'm good. - Yeah, uh-huh, no, of course he can come today. Are you sure you don't have something for both my boys? I understand. Alright, I'll let him know. Thank you. - Who's that? - Where's Felix? - He's in the room. Job interview today. But she only has one spot, it's yours if you want it. Hard physical labor but the pay is really, really good. You think you can handle it? - Yeah. - We just keep this between you and me? I know you won't fuck it up. Go get ready and get outside. It's too nice to be indoors all day. - Where's your water? Hey, where's your water? - In my stomach. So, what do you figure, we'll check out the store tonight, or what? - Tomorrow. - Why not today? - What? - Nothing. Mom just told me about this interview this morning. - So? - So apparently, it's a sure thing. She's got a friend who can help us out. - I don't care. - Listen, man. I think you should seriously think about it. - Dude, we have a fool-fucking-proof way of making cash. - For how long? You can't honestly think this is a long-term solution, huh? And if you do, fuck, you're dumber than I thought. - For as long as we want, Dickinsfield, Timberlea, Thickwood, untouched! - Let me make you a deal. We'll do one more, you can pick whichever one you want, you can even keep my half. Just go to the interview. One more, that's it! I'm getting a job, and when I do, I'm done. Who the fuck do you think you are, dude? Look at you, man, look at yourself. You and me aren't big enough to do anything with our lives, we're not going to do shit. This is what we do, man. You're a fucking scumbag, just like me. - One more. I promise. Just go to the fucking thing, okay. - Okay. - Can I ask you a favor? - Obviously. - Can I borrow money? I just need some to tide me over until my folks get back and our check gets in. - Of course. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - I-I need it today, though. - That's fine. Don't worry. - Thanks. - It's fine. - Thank you. I gotta get some gas. - Oh, shit, what's good, man? This is it. - Cool, cool. Where's the bro? - Job interview. - Him? Christ! You gotta be pretty desperate to pay him to work for you. - Hey, easy. - What? Oh, little bro is growing up! - Shut up, alright? Pierce, you deaf? What's up, Louis? - Not much. What's up, Kev? - Give us a hand? - Yeah, sure. - Alright, come on. - Here. - Over here? - Yeah. Yeah, right here is good. - That it? - Yeah. - Thanks, Louis. - Yeah, man, anytime. - Alright, thanks. - Hey man, I'm just chillin' out if you need help with anything. - Uhhh, yeah, man, actually, like these here. So I kinda need you to just reorganize them by size. - I got it, I got it. - You got it? Nice, I-I'll be back in a bit. - Alright. We're ready for you. As I understand, it was your mother who put you in contact with this position. - Yeah. - I don't know if you know, but your father and I used to work together. - Cool, I didn't know that. - Yeah! Anyways, you're interested in some warehouse work. - Yup. - Oh, this might be a silly question, but do you have any certifications, forklift, anything like that? - Nah. - It's not a problem. We provide extensive training. Have you had any previous experience in a warehouse setting? - Nope. - Okay. Uh, is everything okay? - Yeah, it's just my elbow is bothering me. - Oh. Oh, yeah, just try to ignore that. - Okay. - Uh, do you have any restrictions with time, days you cannot work, time shifts, things like that? - No, I'm pretty much available whenever. - Great. Okay. - Do you have a bathroom? - Uh, yeah, it's down the hall. - Do you mind if I--? Go ahead. - Thanks. - Oh, hey, man. - 'Sup, Pierce? - How'd the interview go? Join the ranks of the working class yet, or what? - It went good? - Yeah, it was good. Wanna take off, or what? - Yup. Yo, what are you guys doing? Joel's having a party. - Cool. - Yeah. - Sweet. - See you later, man. - Peace. Alright, later. - Sorry, just give me a sec. - Yo, what's good, Mish? - Hey, Felix. Uh, can I just get $25 on Pump 13, please. Hey, Louis, what's up? - Just poking around, what are you up to? - Are you with your partner in crime? - Sure am. - Fucking hate her. - Yeah, I'm sure she feels the same way, Felix. - Good. - Do you want a ride? - Actually, yeah, that'd be pretty sweet. - Ah, you know what, we're gonna skate. - Cool. Well, why don't you come, say, hey? - Sure. Come on. - Thank you. - Alexa! Yo, Anorexa, check out my scab. - Hey, you want a hand with that? - No, I'm good. - Hey, you guys remember Joel? - Oh yeah! Is Beth still around? - Hey, you guys ever hear Joel's intro? - Oh, yeah! She's raw! - Yo, as I was saying, he's having a party tonight. - Yeah, you guys should go. Come on, the more familiar faces, the better. - I don't know, I'm kind of over house parties, all those baby-faced kids hanging around. To be honest, I'd much rather drink in somebody's basement. - Trailers don't have basements, dummy. - What do you have to think about? Just come. Show up. - Alright. - Alright, let's get the hell out of here. - See you, guys. - Later. - Peace out. - Hey, should we go? - I guess, if you want. - Well, yeah, I want to go. Why don't you want to go? - I'm trying to save money, Lex. - Well, just take some alcohol from your parents. Like they'll notice. - Maybe. - Or, you have your place completely free, why don't we invite a few people over? Uh, can spread the word. - I'll kill you if you fucking do that again. - So, uh, we're going to go, then? - Fine. - Kiss, kiss! Alright, I'll be in the car. - What the fuck? What the fuck you doing? - Momma. - Hey! Quit it! - Fuck! Mom, jeez! What's the matter with you? Fuck sakes! - What the fuck, mom? - Get out! Get out! Get out of my house! Get out! - The fuck you mad at me for? - I told you boys that if you fucked up, you would be out on your ass. I just got a call from Rhonda. Not only did you not show up, you sent him, and he walked out on a sure thing. And when someone sticks their neck out for you, you don't fuck it up. - What's kicking us out going to prove? - I expect him to fuck up... not you, Louis. - Fuck you! - What? - Fuck you! - Relax. - Get the fuck out of here. I fucking hate you, I hate you. I hate you. You're a terrible mother. - Hey, just relax, man. - Fuck you too, punk. She needs to hear this. - Are you done? You're a terrible mother. You're a terrible mother, I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you. - Mom. Mom, hey! Mom, mom. Mom! - No. - Stop, stop, just stop. You have one week to find a job. One week, or you are out on your asses. Pick this shit up! - So, how do I look? Would you fuck me? Yeah, it's fine. We can go to your house, if you want to get a change? - No, it's fine. You think Devin's going to be there, tonight? - Probably, maybe with Laura. - Maybe. - How was it, anyway? - It was okay. I-I can see why she's with him. - You gotta stop fucking guys with girls. - Have you seen her? Have you seen him? Don't worry, I'm safe. Whatever. I gotta get in the shower. - I hate it here. - Yeah, you and everyone else. - Do you ever think you'll leave? - No. If we're going to have it good anywhere, it's going to be here. - I just don't get it, you know? We're the same, but I'm a fuck-up. How do you do it? - Listen, man, don't let that shit bother you, alright? Just have a good time tonight, let the night go as is, and you'll have a clearer head in the morning. Grab one. Grab one for me too. Better? - Yeah. Hope there's no weird kids hanging out tonight. - You know, we used to be those weird kids, remember? - Yeah, it was weird as hell, back then. Man, remember how fucked up that was? Being 14, 15, hanging out with a bunch of guys in their 20s, doing all kinds of crazy shit. - Remember when Alexa fucked that dude that was like 24 or something. - That's exactly what I'm talking about, exactly. - As if you wouldn't have fucked her. - Yeah, I probably would fuck her, but not if she was seven years younger than me. Man, that's fucked up, even for me. - Alright, take it easy, Casanova. This is us. You gonna be good? - Yup. - Thing's a death trap. - You're a fucking walking death trap. Oh, yo, hold up. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, what time? Yeah, for sure, man, yeah. Thanks. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. What's up? - Uh, that was Kev. He wants me to work early in the morning, so... - So. - I'm just gonna go home. - What about tonight? - Go to the party, have fun, you know, it'll be good for you. - No, I mean, the store. - What about the store? - You're not going to help me, are you? - Look, if things go good with Kev, I don't know, maybe, I can help you get in there, alright? - No, no. - Could be good for us, right? - Nah, man, no. I'm not doing that shit. I'm not your sidekick. Come on. - Well, I can't stop my life every time you want to-- - Stop your life? What life? Fuck! Some life. Fuck. Listen, you promised me that you were gonna do this. When you promise somebody you're gonna do something, you do it. - I promised, if you went to that thing-- - I went. - Come on, man. - I went. - Come on. - I went, come on, I went, I did. Come on, man, you're my fucking brother. You're supposed to have my back, man, that's how it's always been. I have your back, you have my back. - Do something nobody expects you to do, you'll find out it's not so bad on this side. - Fuck you. - Whatever, man. I don't give a fuck what you do. I don't. I'll see you later. Shit! Hey, you want a ride? Get in. - 97.9 FM, Fort McMurray, here's what's making news this hour. At least one man is dead and another airlifted to Edmonton following an accident on Highway 63. Witnesses say one car crossed the center line and ran head-on into an oncoming bus killing the driver instantly. The driver was 31 years old. In other news, there has been a temporary fire ban in the region with dry conditions getting worse... - Thirty-one? That isn't a bad age to die. - That's so young. Don't be an asshole, the guy could've had a family or something. Thirty-one is young, dude. - Way too fucking young. - Man, look it isn't that young if you have a plan, like, I don't want to live forever, I've already peaked. I mean, I could go tomorrow and be a happy camper. That's fucked up. I've just done the things I want to do. - What about a house, a family and any of that shit? No, man, I'm not interested. I mean, I probably would have, but what's the point? Like, buy a million-dollar house and spend the rest of my life paying it off? Like, stuck in one spot, seeing the same people. - Um, I wanna die when I'm really old. I wanna be a hundred. - Okay, that's way too old. - Seventy-five is a good age. Yeah, that's cool, I can get on board with that. - No! I'm sticking to my guns on this one; 30, ideally, in a plane crash. I mean, if not in a plane crash, then natural causes, and if I couldn't get either of those, then, I don't know. If you don't hear from me in a little while, you could probably guess what happened. I mean, I-I'll just take off somewhere foreign, wouldn't tell anyone where I was going, and I would just say a quick goodbye to everybody in a message. - But what if your life turns around and you're happy? Uh... I am happy. - Really? - Yeah. Look, my time will come where it'll be enough for me. It'll happen to you, I hope. Like, where I'm just ready to say goodbye, and just not live anymore. Look, I just look into the future and... I don't see myself in it. Like, once you get through the pool of what's left, you get comfortable and you just settle in to the same boring life. - Yeah. - Can you, just like, let me off here? I gotta pick some shit up from work. Are you sure? I mean... Do you want us to wait? - No. - No. - Nah, it's okay, it's just a short walk. Okay. Alright, buddy. Alright. Later, dude. - Bye, guys, thanks for the ride, Mish. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem, man. Be safe! Later, buddy. - What the fuck? - Fuck, that was depressing. Devin, you're up next. Yeah, no problem. - I'm sorry, but I can't help it. - What about what we talked about earlier? - Right, um. That is the last of my cash. - I need more than this, Lex. - That's all I have on me. Look, come get me tomorrow, and I'll give you the rest, but that's it, okay? Bye. - Are you gonna come sit up front? - Can I ask you something? Of course. - What's the difference between me and him? Who? - Louis. - I don't know. - I'm serious. Off the top of your head, when you think of him, and you think of me, what's the difference? I don't know. - You do know, just want you to lay it on me. It's not a big deal. - I guess there's not that much that's different. When you two are together, you're practically identical. But when you're on your own, you're that same person, and Louis is different. - Yeah, I can see that. - What do you think the difference is? - I don't. I just think we're the same. Always been the same. So, what do you need money for? That's a loaded question. - I could give you some if you need. I'm serious, how much you need? - Everybody could always use more money. Yeah, but you sounded desperate, like you needed it quick. Look, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna owe anybody anything. Especially you. - Just consider it a gift. Think of it as me doing what no one is expecting me to do. - My problems would be solved with like 400 bucks. Okay. So, I'm going to have to ask you. - I'm not telling you what for. - I wanna know, why me? Why not Louis? - I can't ask him for it. I don't expect you to understand why, I just can't. Right now, you're the last option I have. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm pregnant. And I don't want it. Is this the part where you tell me you lost respect for me or something? Hmm. No. You didn't have to tell me that. - I guess I just needed to say it out loud or something. Oh, well. I don't really care. It's not my life, it's yours. - Okay. - Take your jacket off. - I'm not fucking you. - Take your jacket off. Take your jacket off. I'm serious. You know, this money means nothing to me whether I have it or not. My life doesn't change one bit. I'm still just gonna be a piece of shit. Just lean back into the seat, into the door. Lift your shirt up a bit. Pull your pants down a little bit. I think my brother loves you. I see the way that my brother looks at you... when we all hang out. And the way that you look at him. Look at me the way you look at him. - No! - Look at me the way you look at him. Please. I'll be right back. Okay, go. - What do you mean? Where's the money? - We gotta go get it. - But you said you had it. - Drive. When we go in there... don't say anything. Don't even look at them, okay? We can get what we need and get out. I need you. And you need me, okay? It's just us. Hey. Take this. - What do you want, man? - Do you know who I am? No. - Do you know who my brother is? What? What do you want? Come on, man. Come on, put that back. I'll call the cops.
