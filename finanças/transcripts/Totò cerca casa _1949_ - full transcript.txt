Toto Looks for a House This is one of the many cities in the world. In this, as in the others, there are hundreds of thousands, or rather, millions of people. Yet each of them is beset by a problem of their own. There are those who have problems arriving at the office on time. And those, like most of today's troubled humanity are undecided whether to go right or left. On hot summer Sundays there is the problem of finding a place in the sun. For others, however, the problem is to stay on one's feet. But all year, with the housing crisis, the biggest and most distressing problem, the problem of problems, is that of the home. Who wouldn't want to have a house something like this? Of course it's everyone's dream. Of those who live in these human hives. But it is above all the dream of those who are forced to live in places like these, as, for example, the casual worker Beniamino Lomacchio, displaced, misplaced, all over the place, municipal employee, and married with kids. Beniamino! Beniamino! Come on, wake up! It's time for you to go to the office. - What's up? - What were you dreaming about? Dirty swine! But why "dirty"? I was studying geography. See the oceans, lands, gulfs, breasts. You see? You dreamed of naked women. - What naked women! - You see them day and night! Did you take your pills last night? For those hallucinations? These visions must end! Same as always: I've been bitten by an insect yet again. And this beat-up hat, what's it doing here? Of course, dear. Being forced to live in such an environment! Here we need DDT. Mom, I'm Sandokan and I'm going to make war with the pirates. No, breakfast first. I would like to know who took my left shoe... - Did you take it? - No, not me. - Silence! You took it! You see? I'm right. See what you do with your father's shoe? You put a sail on it! - Then why don't you buy me a ship? - Shut up! Criminal! - Stop hitting him! - You realize? With this sail, he makes my underpants. I mean, with my underpants he made this sail! - Then don't tell lies. Understand? - Yes I understand. - We don't tell lies! - We don't tell lies. - Repeat! - We don't tell lies. - Alright. - Is breakfast ready? - Yes, it's ready. - Is breakfast ready? - Yes! - Let's eat. Take it, it's for you. - What's is this? - Salti Soda. - Salti Soda? - Yes. - We breakfast with an aperitif? Dad, you know we do it for the competitions. Sure! And until we win, we'll eat stuff with prizes. And, if we win, we'll finally have a real home. - Got it? - Got it. They couldn't put up a good competition with steaks, for example? Dad! Steaks, really. We've only just got up! He'll have dreamed of them last night, along with his filth. Filth? Have steaks become filthy? I take pleasure in it! The filthy steaks! Where are we?! What world do we live in?! What is this century? What century? - Aida! - Oh! Checchino! Aida! - Love, are you ready? - No. I just got up. Meanwhile come up. Dad wants to say hello. I won't say hello to anyone. - Don't you want to say hello to my boyfriend? - What boyfriend? That's a man who clearly has no future. Look who's talking! One who hasn't even found a home! If I marry Checchino, he'll find us a house. Better to live a hundred years in this school than one day with Checchino. - May I? - Who's there? - Come in, Checchinuccio. I'll be ready right away, honey. - How are you? How's paparooni? - I won't let you... - call me "pepperoni"! - I didn't say "pepperoni". - I said "paparooni". - Anyway, the ship. - Put on your pants and go get water. - Yes sir, I'm going. Better. So I can turn my back on the figure of this wretch. - I'll be Aida's hubby. - No, a hobby like you I don't like. My only hobby is eating. N'est-ce pas? Absolutely. I heard it with my own ears. Would we joke? - But where will we go? - It doesn't concern me. I'm sorry. - Colonel, what's going on? - The schools are starting again - and we'll no longer be able to live here. - No! - Yes. - No. - Yes. - Do they want to send us away? Oh, fantastic! But then you have to take a repetition to the Ministry. - A repetition? - Maybe he meant "petition". Exactly! If we make a nice petition, everyone, including him, I assure you, more or less, - we'll be nice mass of stinkers. - The stinker will be you. And thank God that they'll soon boot him out of here! Here we are and here we stay. Displaced people of the whole wide world, unite! Would you please keep that baguette down, please? Those are unfair means. I have been a janitor in this school for 30 years. Now I have the room, I have the chickens, and, because of you, I can't lose my job. Know what I've got to say to you? Make do. - A fine thing to say! Make do! - Not at all! "Make do". A fine thing! Is it possible that I, at my age, should have a janitor order me around? What's the world come to? Make do! Checchino, you absolutely have to come up with an idea. If you find us an apartment dad can no longer prevent our marriage. If only I could get a good scoop! An exhibition, a photograph. A sensational photograph like those published on magazine covers. I'd become famous. And then.... And then, my love, I... Hey, I say! What are we doing? Shameless! How dare you talk to my daughter in such a state? - What state? She's naked, exposed to prefectorial condemnation. - Dad! - Dad, rubbish! Young man! More satyr than man, out of my house! - Stop! - I won't even stop for... - Oh God! Your head! What a fright! - There's been a mistake. Yes and I'm looking right at him, where did you find him? Young man, I won't allow you to bother my daughter no more. Alright? We'll see. It won't end like this. - It won't end like this? - No, not like this. - And how will it end? - I don't know. But not like this. That's what I say. How will it end? - Somehow it will have to end. - Sure. That's enough! Get out of my house! When he's famous, you'll be delighted I married him. - Wretch! - Who's there? Who is it? Rascals! I'll make you pay. Sorry, have you noticed.... - Is this your egg? - Yes. I rented it. - Rented? - I picked it up. I mean, borrowed it. Picked it up. Picked it up? Didn't buy it? - I bought it for rent. - But how, dad? Don't tell lies. You swiped it off the janitor. - Oh yes? You scoundrel! - Come on! My good man! It seems odd. At your age, with that cap, with that braid, you really believe in such nonsense, such gossip? - Away with you! He's a boy, degenerate. - Beniamino! - Yes. To the ruins of a father 4F, disabled.... - And an egg thief! - Sir! I won't let you make certain insinuations in my presence, understand? You are faced with an upstanding registry official! - Where did you get this egg? It's still warm. - Warm? - Yes. - Possible? Well then! It's warm. Now, I'll tell you. But you must promise not to tell anyone. Do you want to know the origin of this egg? That egg... I laid it. Oh yes? You lay eggs, do you? Modestly! What d'you want? Oh yeah! It was the war: lack of food, shortage of provisions. I adapted myself. It's the right word: adapted. - Lay one right now. - What? Standing up? Standing up. Lay me an egg. You know to lay an egg you need the right atmosphere. If you don't lay me an egg right now, you'll see what happens to you. All right. I'll do it. Damn it! Seven hours I've been waiting! Silence! We have been patient for 40 years. That's enough! Next. Whose turn is it? - I'd like to denounce... - Complaints are made at the police station! - Heartless father! Go away! - One moment... - Go away! I came for a death. Death? Look: at the bottom, on the right. Three steps. - Good morning. - Morning. I came to notify the birth of a child. Last night, half past two. - And who's the salami? The father? - Me. Pasquale Saluto. - And nobody else? - And what would that mean? - Sometimes, you know! - Repeat that outside! A bit on the side, quite! but first things first. What name do you want to impose on the little man? - We've decided to call him Franco. - Franco? No! No! Look, politically, it doesn't suit him. Listen to me. - You're right. We hadn't thought of it. - You have to think about it. - Umberto. - Umberto? Umberto.... No, I don't recommend it. See, I don't recommend it. - Tito! - No, worse. Especially right now. For God's sake! - You know, to name a child, you have to be careful. - It's true. He could be compromised, torn to pieces, - put in a salami like this. In a manner of speaking. - No, please! So, Giuliano. Eh! Yes! I don't mind. - Giuliano, yes. Popular name. - Popular. - Two lire for the stamp. - I've no change. - Haven't you? - No. - What to do, my son! Gracious! Well! I'll take this then. See you soon. ABSENT DUE TO URGENT BUSINESS Lomacchio, what are you doing? Eating in the office? No. Examining. Sorry. - Paperwork? - Yes, paperwork. - Thanks. Lomacchio, come here for a moment. A little dizzy. Sorry. You are lucky that I need you. See this? It's a request for the post of caretaker. Employed by the council. - Since it also includes accommodation... - Accommodation? Yes. Free accommodation for the caretaker and his family. - A relative of mine who is homeless... - Homeless? He asked me to support his request. - Mine? Yours! What have you got to do with it? Let me speak. His, his, not yours! It's done. Now it's all done. This is it. It only needs stamping and the assignment is done. But you go to the stamp office. I don't want to appear too... understand? Indeed, on the form you must write the name of my relative. Write it yourself, because I wouldn't want my handwriting recognized. Hurry, because the Honourable Pastarosa, the Mayor, will make an inspection without warning. I want it all over before he arrives. The name written on the application is Camilloni Filippo. - Camilloni? - Camilloni. - With "C"? - Yes! - Like Naples? - Yes. But what does Naples have to do with it? - Exactly. - But do you understand? - Are you sure accommodation is included? - If I tell you so! Sir, you can trust in me. - Omert√†. - But what does omerta have to do with it? I'd be stupid to give the accommodation to Camilloni Filippo! I'll get the lodging myself! - Sir, this is the stamp office. - Good. Very good. Here is the Registry Office. - And the employees? - Are very happy - and above all very disciplined. - Good. Very good. At the other table. One here and one here. Again, again! This is the new technician. We are doing very well. Yes, very well. It is electric. Nice nice. What are you doing? Who is this gentleman? I ask you! Who are you? What are you doing? He's crazy?! He's crazy! Get him! Madam, your husband doesn't appreciate me enough. Intervene. What does it matter being poor in your pocket when is one rich in here? - Watch out, dad's coming. - At this time? Go away, it's for the best, or he'll kick up the usual fuss. - Goodbye, pale flower. - Yes. But go, go. And say nothing. If you open your mouth there's only trouble. I heard a voice. - Heard an animated conversation. - No. - Heard chattering? - What's that? - Yes, heard prattling. - I told you no. - Perhaps I heard muttering? - No! No! No! - Alright. I must be wrong. Anyway, I have some news to give you. - Oh yes? What is it? - Don't keep us on tenterhooks. Wonderful news. Yet I heard babbling. I said no! There was nobody here. Stop that! - What's this news? - I found a house. - What?! - You found... - A house. - Is it possible? - A real house? - Really real. A new job. Municipal Caretaker. With rights, free, four rooms, bathroom, kitchen, telephone...." Great! So I can call the firemen! Firemen! Here it is. With all the regulatory stamps. Today we will take possession of the new accommodation and so on and so forth. What? Graveyard caretaker? - What?! - To the graveyard? - Caretaker to the cemetery. - Caretaker to the cemetery? Well! It's a job like any other. - Honoured and upright. - To the graveyard! Graveyard. It's a yard just like any other. Grave-yard. - I'm not going. - And me neither. Me neither. What "neither"? Girls! No kidding! Let us remember that old Sicilian saying which says: "Your death, my wife". And then, let's think about it: if there were no dead, there'd be no cemeteries. If there were no cemeteries, we wouldn't have found a home. Clear? Yeah. But I'm not going to the graveyard. Not even dead. But dad, just think, it's so far from the city! If someone feels sick at night, you can't even go looking for a doctor. Nothing! Everyone would croak. And where would you find it more convenient? You croak, you have the cemetery in-house. Saves the walk. - You're crazy! You go to the cemetery! - Enough! - You go to the cemetery! - Enough! Madam, remember... that the wife must follow her husband! And you don't look a gift cemetery in the grave. Is that clear? For goodness sake! May I? Is it alright? Excuse me, it doesn't bother you if we enter, by any chance? Are you dead or what? What are you afraid of? Stupid. Light... lightning. And this would be the house? Oh God, I certainly can't blame you. The house, indeed, as a home is not very beautiful. But, on the other hand, my dear wife, let's take a little look at the view we have here. A view is worth a thousand words. There's a draught. A draught. - And the other rooms? - This way. Living room, gas cooker, when there is, telephone. The so-ons will be there, on that side there. The so-forths... - I don't feel quite right. - Me neither. - Me neither... What are you saying? Your fears are groundless, passing fancies. Hear that peace! The silence of the tomb! Let's go, you lot. For me, in comparison, it was better before. Let's not start on the defensive. The past is dead and buried. Buried... Women! Women! Let's see. Four... Four rooms... - Oh, God! - May I? Who is it?! - Good evening. - Good evening. Excuse me, but you are alive? I am the vice-caretaker of the cemetery. - It shows. - From the cap? No. From the face. And would you be the new custodian? - Yes, sir. - On behalf of the director, I have to hand over the deliveries. Here they are. These are burial tickets. - Burial? - Burial. You must fill them in every time you get... a new customer. Understood. Say, you who are familiar with the environment, - the traffic, here, what's it like? - It's not bad. The influx is continuous. The convoys are numerous. - In short, the place is thriving. - It depends. Sometimes. You understand: the more activity, the more tips there are. For example, when there's some contagious disease. - Some nice epidemic. - Business is booming. - Of course. A little measles. - A little chicken pox. - Smallpox. - Nazionali cigarettes. Tell me, you who are alive, satisfy my curiosity. - Who is that man? - That's the caretaker who just died. Nice portrait, eh? So lifelike. The eyes. They always seem to follow you. Pay attention, look carefully. They are eyes that stare at you in a strange way. He was a passionate musician. He played the piano. The funeral march, who knows how well he played it? Poor Giuseppe. He followed his boarders: you don't live long here. - Why not? - You see, always among the dead, even at night. Why, at night? - There are nights that leave their mark. - Oh, Jesus. It doesn't happen often, but it happens. You don't have to take it like that. At least, for now. You will have plenty of time afterwards. - Once upon a time... - What happened? A guy who wasn't yet dead, started at night... - to knock from below. - No! - He wanted to get out, see? It's impossible. To get the deceased out of the box, no complaints are allowed! - In any case, in the case of tombs.... - Getting worked up... - There's that bell. - The bell. For whom the bell tolls. - It's connected to the burial niches. - The...? - Niches. - Niches. If the bell rings, There's a dead person wanting to get out. - You go there.... - Knock and ask: "Did Sir call?" - Oh, God! What's that? - The owl clock. - Owl? Yes, you must understand. Given the setting, a cuckoo clock would have seemed far too frivolous. Good evening. - Good evening. - He's my deputy. - Very good. - I have to go. I forgot: tomorrow morning, if you get there, don't forget to water 27 and 132. - Yes, sir. 48 and 93 are free. 125 leaves tomorrow. - Being transferred. - I'll let him know. - Good night. - Good night. - Rest in peace. - Amen. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! What is it? What happened? The dead man! Help! The bell! He's coming! Can't you see it's the phone? It's the phone. Hello. Is it you? Yes, we're here. I'll wait for you. - Who was? - Wrong number. Excuse me. - Excuse me. - You're welcome. I've now left my dear departed at the funeral home. - I know you have to close. - Yeah. We work a split shift. Would you be so kind, later, to combine these flowers with those that surround the body. - Body, which body? - That of my poor husband. Ah, yes! Are you the wife of a corpse? I mean, the man who died. A corpse. - My dear Filippo. - This one? He's your husband? But what a handsome man! Damn! He's dead? Congratulations. - And change the candles with these. - Aren't the others enough? - At midnight they'll be extinguished. - Should I change them at midnight? Why don't they make them longer? 10-15 meters. Everything to save money! - I beg you: at midnight. - At midnight. I want that he never lacks neither flowers nor candles... My poor Filippo. - Leave it to me. I will never, ever forget him. - Try to console yourself, ma'am. - Never! No one can ever console me. Who will rock me in his arms? Why, did your husband rock you? - Who will have his tenderness? - Who will have his courage? - Goodbye. It is better to be good. - Yes. So, sooner or later, everyone will end up down below. Aida! Aida! Come on, Aida, let's go to bed. And don't be afraid now that your father is awake. Oh well! How unpleasant he is. And never takes his eyes me. The Kiss of a Dead Woman The Corpse who Returned The Hand of a Dead Man What's that? Help! Aida? Oh, God! Back from the tomb! Back from the tomb. Who is it? Help! Help! Mama! Who is it? - It's midnight. What are you doing? - Nothing. Having fun with this little owl. Little rascal! - Yes. But it's midnight. - Yeah. Time for bed. What bed? It's time to change the candles. Don't you remember what you promised the widow? It's true. It's true. I'd forgotten. - Go and be quick. I'm afraid. - Afraid? You? Are you afraid here in the house? While I... alone, go to the garden, surrounded by tombs, - in the graveyard. - Here. Get the candles. By chance, you wouldn't be afraid too? Afraid me? Tut tut! You are a baby! Look! Who is it? Reinforcements. I'm going. BODIES IN TRANSIT TOOL SHED Help! Help! Help! Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts! The tomb! Help! - Hurray! There are ghosts! - Get going! - Was it you! - Dad! - Is it you? - Don't you recognize your little wife? It's you! Oh God! There he is! There he is!! Begone! Ghost, begone! Help! What a breast! What fragrance! What a breast! What a breast! Hey! Wake up! Wake Up! - Who is it? - Who is it? - On the most beautiful! - Yeah. The usual hallucinations. Right, dirty swine? Always naked women, eh? What naked women! I was dreaming of a chicken. And what a chicken! A golden chicken. Blast it! We're back in this damn school! Luckily, I forgot to return the key to the janitor. We've been lucky. A fine impression when the others realise we're back here. It was you. Remember, but down there in the cemetery - we always have a little home. - Stop it! - You'll see. Look at that thing! Is this the way to treat trousers? While I repair them, you go down to get water for coffee. Coffee Cup, with which you can compete for 5 million prizes! - Run along. - You want me to go in my pants? Who'll see you at this hour? Here. Dad, how cute you are in your underwear! You look like a penguin! Impudent boy, shut up! Show some respect for your parent. Lost youth! Good morning, Director. Finally this school has been reopened too. Did you tidy everything up? - Everything but the Science room. - Why? Until a few nights ago, the Lomacchio family lived there. But, fortunately, they left with the other displaced people. So long as that room is ready tomorrow. There's not much time today. There'll be a reopening party. Then the Mayor will come with the ladies and governesses. - We must create a good impression. - Of course. When the Mayor enters, you will take him here in the corridor. so he can admire all the work we've been able to do. - This way. - Very good. Very good! And you? What time do you call this? We start the school year on time, right? - You see, really... - What "see"?! - I... - Let's not start with an apology! - I'm passing through. - Passing?! - Exactly. - Give me your hand. - Which hand? - Your hand! - What for? - Ah! Excuse me. - Come here. To your place! - Straight to your place! - This is a bullying! - Isn't he grown up! - What a dunce! - Here! - How many years have you been held back? The same as your sister. Zippety! Professor, the Mayor has arrived with the governesses. They're in class III. Now they're coming here. I urge you boys: quiet and good. And don't make me look bad, you understand? Stand! - Good morning. - Very well. This would be lll B? - Quite so, Mr. Mayor. - Good. Sit down! Sit down! Children, if one of you has something to say, raise your hand. Speak up, dear boy. What is it? My classmate ate my breakfast. A poor show. These things aren't done. Hey you, tiny! Yes, you, tiny. Yes, you. Come out a little, dear boy. Come on. Perhaps he's embarrassed. Tiny? Come here. Don't be afraid. Come to me. Show your little face. Isn't he cute, eh? So, Mr. Mayor, if it would please you to question someone in this room.... - Yes, yes. Why not? In fact, call that rascal over there. Didn't you hear? Yes, dear boy. You. Come forward. Come. Take your dainty fingers out of your mouth! There's a good little boy, come here to me. Come on, dear. Come on, beautiful baby. Come here. What a good boy. Here he is. Come. - Wait, come here a moment! - Me? - Yes. Your face seems familiar. What's your name? Me? - Fu-fu... - What? - Fuffoni. Fuffoni? But your father, what's your father's name? Fulvio Fu-Fu-fu-fu - Stop him! - Travel baskets! - In your places! - Stop them! - Boys, stop! To Reggio Calabria, all change! - What are they doing?! - Stop it, I say! Come to me, come on. To your places! Go on! Good boy! My lovely lambkin. No! No! No! What a devil, that Fuffoni. We mustn't scold him. - It's the first day of school. How happy they are. - Of course! Yes, the Countess is right. Fuffoni, go to the blackboard and take the chalk. Go. Here it is. Fuffoni, at your command. So, let's hear a little: let's see if you can solve this little problem. - Yes, sir. - A lady buy 375 kilograms of potatoes from a grocer. at a price of 45.80 lire per kilogram. How much will the lady have paid in all? What's the greengrocer's name? This is a pedagogical system I'm completely unaware of. Oh well. The greengrocer is called Ubaldo. - Ubaldo Pistacchioni. - Father's name? Name unknown, I understand. And where do you live? What does the lady's address have to do with it? In short! And his sister, how is she? If don't don't tell me, you're filibustering. This boy is quite... Alright then! Four, eight, twelve, sixteen, nineteen.... Nineteen and two, twenty-two. Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, seven, nine, nine.... - Your phone number? - What?! Never mind, I'll find it in the phone book. Twenty-nine, thirty. 745 and a quarter. 745 and a quarter. - Well done. - Very good! You deserve a candy. - And also a nice kiss! - Mama! - What a strange child! - Child, my eye! That's my husband! - It's him! With the stamps! - You rascal! Sitting on a woman in your underwear? Coward! Delinquent! - Madame! All the world's displaced get together! Grab him! He's crazy. He's the madman who stamped my bottom! Take him alive! Gently. Young man, I don't trust you. - May I know where you're taking us? - To the studio of my painter friend. Since he's leaving Rome for a few months, you can come and live here. Well! I've seen worse. Airy, spacious, bizarre. - Ah, there are other tenants. - No. The painter Grancassi... - What? - Grancassi. - Grand catty? Like a leopard. He's a specialist in female nudes. He concentrates on nothing else. He's no fool! Yes, yes. Interesting. This building's... not bad... it pleases me. Here, do you see daddy that I'm useful in something? - Can I hope for your consent? - Young man, it's not excluded. - It's not excluded. - Then we can kiss, Dad. - You're not my type! Beniamino! What are you doing? Nothing. Checking the premises. - Crazy things: there is no sense of decency anymore. - It's true. - Mum, what's that stuff? - Otello, don't you look it! - And you, turn these pictures round. - Yes. - Not like that, wretch! Like so. - Ah, yes! And now, to work! Take this duster and do something. Move! - I beg you: for strangers, you are the painter Grancassi. - Yes. And remember: no one goes down the stairs. If they realize the studio is inhabited by strangers, there'll be trouble. OK? - You, for strangers.... - I'm a big pussy cat. No, you're the painter Grancassi. I'm going down to phone Aunt Geltrude. To see if she'll gives me a mattress. Come on. - Move, clean up. - Go, go! Go, yes. Hey! Young man! We're going to the rooftops to see the panorama. - What panorama? - The panorama. Young man, remember that I have not yet consented. However, given the time and circumstances, "panoramate", but with discretion. Here, for example, here's a thing, just what I need. Just what I need. Done. Who goes there? Who's there? Good morning, maestro. - Good morning. - I'm the one who called. You must excuse me for being late. But, miss! Shall we start right away? But, I say, lady, young lady... I don't know, I say... Don't you want me undressed? Don't you remember the phone call? We already agreed? Naked. As you prefer? Sure! But, I say... You, undressing, in front of a male man! - Oh, no? Why not? - I see. Out of habit. A painter is like a doctor: in seeing a woman he views her professionally. - Which view would you like? - Me? An all round view. See, I'm used to seeing things from every side... - and from all points of view. - Oh! How is that? Distinguish, anatomize, study the details. - It's your principle? - No, what principles. - You'll be my death! - I understand, maestro. You want to see me like this? So, maestro, let me explain what it is. By phone I couldn't tell you everything. I want to offer the man I love... an indelible memory of my beauty. So, even when I'm no longer young, he'll have an image of my naked body, just like it was in the best years of our love. - Maestro, are you listening? - But how do I paint your... face, if you don't remove the veil? Never! You will never see my face. Eastern women do not uncover their faces in front of strangers. - I am Persian. - Sure. A little modesty is needed. Not like us! - Women show their faces to everyone. - Shall we start? I can't hold back much longer. My darling knows nothing and I want to surprise him. If he doesn't see me soon he'll get suspicious. He's madly jealous. What is it, Maestro? Please hurry. Right away, let's get started. I've heard so much about you, maestro, that you're one of the best modern painters. - Which school are you from? - From the Garibaldi school. I was one of the displaced. Displaced, is that the current fashion? Alternating current, with these curves. Are you a futurist, an impressionist or a realist? Me, Social Democrat, Monarchist, Republican. - Historical? - No, geographical. - Who can it be? One your family? - Well, no! My family don't come through the door. Who's that? Who's there? No, thanks. We don't want any rugs. I am a displaced person from the Garibaldi school! For mercy's sake! Look, it's a mistake! You've got your wires double crossed! - Beniamino! What are you doing? - Looking after number one! - Every man for himself! - What are you doing? The Colosseum! Is this the only home you can give your family! - Not even a roof! - What's that? - Roof! You're hard to please. We've just put the bathroom in and already you want a roof! We'll talk about it this winter. What are you saying? I'm sick of living under the arches! And you're complaining? The whole world envies us this place. And you despise it. This year, from all parts of the globe, hundreds of thousands of billions of pilgrims will arrive to enjoy these beauties.

Look, Amalia, there's also a bath for the baby. Here, girls, this is the apartment that I've rented. This is your bedroom. I'll sleep there. There's a suitcase missing. Go see, dear, if you left it in the hall. - What? - In the hall. - What? - In the hall. - And who's Hall? The concierge? - No, in the lobby. - In the anteroom. Now we're uptown we say "hall". It's more elegant. Yes? The hall? Then I'll go down to see, in the "hall". What happened? Do you feel sick? No, no. Today we sit like this. Sure dear. It's very chic. More elegant. - Tell me: what should I do in the lobby? - Take the suitcase. - The... - The suitcase. Why, has it gone? - No, indeed. There are suitcases galore. - What are you saying? Mum, mum!

Don't you believe me? - No. Look! - So it's a matter of pills. - Pills, my eye! Take them or you'll end up in the madhouse! Yet I saw them. Must have been an optical effect. Come on, hurry! Girls, let me warn you, I'm a sleepwalker. If you see me walking round the house, don't wake me, it could be dangerous. It's something already if you haven't lost your suitcase. Inside there's a truss, woollen underpants. Now take this pill and you'll be having no more hallucinations. - What's that pink hanky? - It's not a pink hanky. - Then what is it? - A pair of... - Pair of? It's been a couple of days since I've felt... - I'll get your truss. - No! There's no need. There's nothing wrong. It's merely a hallucination. Then take this pill. How many times do I have to tell you? - Damn those pills! - What's wrong with you? There are hallucinations and hallucinations. Wow! - What was it like? - That was a hallucination and a half. - As soon as I took the pill it disappeared. - Aren't you happy? Happy, fiddlesticks! You, normal people, can't understand. You see, hallucinations are divided into two distinct categories: there are good hallucinations and bad ones. - And how was yours? - Excellent! Quiet. You see, the rooms are all occupied. I can give you a bathroom. - Bathroom? - Bathroom. Good. Bathroom. Oh yes. And how much do I pay? - How many lire? - Five thousand. - Five thousand? - Good. Five thousand lire. - Yes. - One, two, three, four, five. - Thanks. - I still have two suitcases. - Ah! Fine, goodbye. I'll come right away, dear. I'm just popping to the bathroom. - Amalia! Amalia! - What is it now? - What suitcases? - They're multiplying. - Multiplying? - How many? - 200. I don't know. - Enough of all this nonsense. - But I've seen them. Come on, take another pill. Swallow it! Where have you been? Is something wrong with the bathroom? - Nothing. Everything's fine. Are these the pills? - Yes. Aida! Ssh! They're asleep! - I'd given up waiting. - I promised, didn't I? - What time d'you call this? - I've been to nightclubs hoping to take a scandalous picture, but nothing! - My sweetie! - But the day will come when I'll photograph some VIP. Don't let them see you. Hey! Beniamino! Beniamino, wake up! - Wake up! - What's wrong? - I heard noises. - Who's there? Who is it? What are you doing? - It's not possible. - I'm telling you, there's someone in the house. - We're alone in the house. - No, I heard a noise. - I heard voices. Go look! - Me? - You. - What? Unarmed? - Arm yourself with something and go. Move it! - One moment! - Hurry! - Who is it? Rascal! Rascal, scoundrel! Come on, honey, come on. What are you afraid of? You know that I bought this apartment for you. You won't hit me anymore? What are you saying? The other day I was out of my mind. Besides, you explained that it wasn't your fault. It's that swine who passed himself off as a painter. But if I find him, I'll disembowel him, smash him! - I swore it to Mohammed. - Calm down, love. But yes. Let's go to our nest. Nobody will disturb us. No one knows I'm here. Here is the tyrant's car, the enemy of our independence. He's up there, under her thumb. This is the moment to act. Justice be done in the name of the Prophet. Quick, give me the bomb. Beniamino! Beniamino! Beniamino! - We haven't been here in a long time. - It seems like a hundred years. I thought it was you. What are you thinking of? When else is there? I'm only flesh and blood! - It's your husband's fault. - If he finds you here, he'll make the usual fuss. - He's walking around. - Woe to you if he finds you. - Want something to drink, honey? - Yes, my love. What have you brought me, honey? Oh, God! Massacre! - Amalia! - Dirty old man! - Scoundrel! - Vile seducer! Damn it all! You keep on getting your wires double crossed! Amalia, I swear to you, this woman is a vision. - This a vision? A vision, my eye. - It's a vision of my eye. Allah! Allah! Beniamino! - Beniamino! - Mohammed! Excuse me, just passing through. The ambassador of Kubistan in his underwear! Finally! What a scoop! This photo will make my fortune! It's all a mistake, a misunderstanding. I don't know anyone! Careful, don't stop the car. There's a bomb attached to the brake! - If it stops, we'll all go up! - What?! Careful! Hey, what'll we do? - Eyes on the road, stupid! - Who's stupid?! One look was enough. Let's stop or I'll drown! Impossible. You must wait for the gas to run out. Careful! Citizens! This monument that we will now unveil, an excellent work of an illustrious artist, represents our country arising from the rubble. Here is the synthesis of the reconstruction. It's him! It's him! It's him! It's him again! Get him! The madman! Get him! Get him! This is indeed a magnificent place. A beautiful villa, a wonderful park, Abundant food, free cigars. What more could one wish for? Provincial Lunatic Asylum Hospital Wing Toto Looks for a House Subtitles: corvusalbus
