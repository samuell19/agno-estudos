Help! Help! Somebody help! Do you think we're getting the bunny? I don't know, I hope so. Pretend to be asleep. Rise and shine. Oh, no, you guys aren't awake yet? I hope I don't have to tickle you. Wow, you guys really are asleep. I guess we won't have any tablet time before school. - No! - Aha! I knew that would get you. Kohen, we were supposed to trick her. You can't trick trick me. Now, come on, it's time to wake up. Good morning. Morning, daddy! Kohen, did you sleep in your sister's room again last night? - Yes. - Yeah? You're getting too old for that, buddy. Alright. He was scared. I protected him. Thank you, Maggie. You look nice today. Good morning. Good morning. I have your coffee right here. Aw, Maggie. That's so nice of you. Sorry, I didn't want sugar this today. No worries, there's plenty more. - Here you go. - Oh! Kids, are you gonna be good for Maggie this morning? Kaeden, Kohen? - Yes. - Yes. So, what are you up to today? Um, I think I'll go to the square and get some shopping done. Maybe have lunch with Adelaide. You? I got that meeting with Weinberg today. Wish me luck. If we get this deal done, we might be looking at a new beach house. Let's look into the Hamptons this time. I'm sick of running into Barbara every time we go to the cape. Ugh! She was.. Okay, kids, have a good day. Alright, you two. Love you.

So, I want you to have a few of my old ones. Oh, thank you, Kristen, but that's not necessary. Well, there's nothing wrong with a little update now and then. Okay, yeah. Thanks. Um, I better go get the kids from school first. So, um, for the party.. 'Maggie!' - oh, no. - Oh, no. Well, I guess that's it, guys. We need to clean up and get our pj's on. - No! - One more! Hey, guys. What are you still doing up? I was just gonna put them to bed. Would you like to have a glass of wine? Oh, no, I’m-I'm okay. Thank you. Ah, come on, just one glass. Don't tell me you're a lightweight. Actually, I was going to ask you guys if you're okay with me meeting up with my friend Hannah. She just closed a house and wants to celebrate. Yeah, of course. 'I don't mind putting the kids' 'to bed first though.' oh, please. Go on. Enjoy yourself. We'll put the kids to bed. Kaeden, Kohen. Tell Maggie goodnight. - Night. - Goodnight. Goodnight, guys, I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay? - Okay. Here's to selling that house and this new listing, you're killing it. Oh, thanks, girl, I'm just happy to finally have you out for the night. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. And to think some people think a 40 hour work week is full-time. I'm one of those people. But I get it. I haven't seen you in like a month. How's it been lately? Is Kristen given you any more bougie gifts? Well, she gave me this today. I was wondering why you looked so gorgeous. It's pretty cool that you get all that expensive stuff for free. Yeah, it is pretty nice. And I do love working for them. But I just wish Frederick would stop hitting on me. Have you thought about finding a new job if he keeps it up? I mean, he hasn't done anything overt worth quitting over it. It's just the subtle things he says sometimes. Plus, you know those kids mean everything to me. I know you want to stick it out until you leave for school but that's not for a long time. The thing is...I'm not sure if I'm still going. What do you mean? You didn't accepted the offer yet? I don't wanna leave the kids. They make me so happy. I'm not trying to tell you what to do with your life, okay? But as your best friend I think I owe you my advice. Those kids are gonna grow up and they're not gonna need an au pair. Then what are you gonna do? Find someone else's kids to get attached to? Over and over for the rest of your life? You have to plan for your future. And this master's program is something you've always wanted. You already rejected it once. I mean I didn't have a choice the first time. - I didn't have the money. - But now you do. Maggie, you are a selfless sweetheart. But we have to focus on ourselves sometimes. You can always visit the kids. But if you do decide to stay can you ask Kristen if she has any dresses in my size? Maybe if you buy me another drink. Deal. - We need shots, right? - Oh, my god. Can we get two shots of Tequila? I'm gonna go to the ladies room. I'll be back. I am back. Okay.

Goodnight. - I'm done. - Me too. - But you guys didn't finish. - I'm ready to go. Okay, just one minute, I have to talk to your parents about something. Kristen, Frederick, would you guys mind coming in here? We're coming. Hey! Is everything okay? Yeah. I just wanted to tell you guys something. I have decided... Oh, wait, before I forget.. ♪ Ta ta ra ♪♪ This is our way of saying thank you for everything you've done for us this year. 'You've been a big help.' Kristen picked it out. Merry Christmas. Frederick, Kristen, this is really sweet. Thank you. Try it on. Mm. Oh, Maggie, it's beautiful. Oh, what were you gonna tell us? I have decided to go back to school in the fall to get my master's degree. So, you'll be leaving us? But Maggie, I don't want you to leave. - Oh. - Don't let her go. No, I won't be leaving, sweetie. I was just hoping to cut down to part time. Maggie, this is, it's quite a shock. How could you work part time when we'll both be busy? And what, you expect Kristen to take care of kids when you're busy? You don't think I can handle it? - I didn't say that. - But that's what you meant. Okay, let's not argue in front of the kids. Alright? Why don't you take them to school? I'm gonna talk to Maggie, okay? Okay, kids, let's, uh, let's get ready to leave, huh? No! I don't want Maggie to leave. Me neither. Kaeden, Kohen. Come down here! Can I speak with you in the study, please? Yeah. Maggie, you know how much we love you. Please, stay. It's not that I don't want to.. I just can't imagine not seeing you here every day. There's gotta be some solution. Believe me, I've thought about this a lot but I've made my decision. If you can't keep me on part-time you'll have to find a replacement for me in the fall. Well, we just can't do part-time. Isn't there anything else we can do? I'm sorry, but no. Well.. Anything I can do? What do you mean? I mean, sure, there must be something we can work out. Hm? Frederick, what are you doing? I'm giving you a reason to stay. Get out of my house. Forget the notice. You're fired. Frederick, I.. I'll send a driver to deliver your belongings. Go. Here. You should take this back. I don't want it. Get out of my house. I'm not gonna ask you again. I'll go say goodbye to the kids. No, you won't. You gather your essentials and go. Get out of here! Now! Maggie. This will keep you safe. Safe from what? You're leaving now? Frederick couldn't convince you to stay? No, I.. Goodbye, Maggie. Can I get you some more coffee? Oh, yeah. Thanks. I hope you don't mind my asking, but is everything okay? I'm okay. I can take the check. No, no, I am gonna keep this coffee coming and it's on me. Really? Yeah, I insist. Thank you. That's really sweet of you. The name's Ruth.

I'm here to make a statement. He can take it here. Yeah? 'Hayes?' - oh! Uh, hi. Uh.. - Hi. Come on in. How are you? Um, I called earlier about the car that tried to hit me. That was you? Oh! Um, yeah. Have a seat. Thanks. Okay. Um, so, uh.. What's your name? Maggie, Maggie Ford. Cool. Nice to meet you, Maggie. I'm deputy Hayes. So, uh, did you get the make and model of the car? It was a red sedan. Uh, I'm not sure about the year. And you're sure it wasn't an accident? It's pretty icy out there tonight. I don't think it was, I mean, it seemed like they were trying to hit me. Yeah, okay, yeah. I'm just being thorough. Um, okay, uh, did you get the license plate number? No, it all happened so fast. By the time I'd even realized what had happened they were already gone. Yeah, I can't really blame you there, you know. But, uh, I can't really put out an Apb on every red sedan in town. Yeah, I know. But hey, you know we really are uh, cracking down on all the reckless driving especially this time of year when everyone's got nothing better to do, but drink, you know. I mean, I guess they could have been drunk but it just seemed so calculated. Okay, yeah, um, alright. Um, so do you know of anyone that wishes to cause you harm? Uh, well, I had an incident earlier today with my boss. My ex-boss. Okay. What happened? I was his au pair up until today. I gave him a notice that I'd be leaving for school again in the fall. I don't wanna get into the whole thing but he was really upset and fired me. Kinda sounds like you're having a bad day, Maggie. Sorry. Yeah, I, I guess you could say that. Well, um, do you think this guy is the type of guy that would try to attack you? I don't know. Not really. But I've never seen him as angry as he was today. Um, what's his name? Frederick Cargill. Frederick Cargill of Cargill development? The one and only. Uh, look, Maggie, um Frederick Cargill is a very powerful man and I can't really go around accusing him of attempted murder based on a hunch. Yeah. I knew that when I came in. Just wanted to get it on record. Well, guess I watch too many crime shows. No, no, no, I mean you're doing the right thing you know coming in here and letting us know. So, good that you came in. It's good. Um, look, take my card, and, um, you know you can just call me, uh, whenever you want. It's always on day and night. So, won't be a bother to hear from you for anything. So, um.. - Okay. - 'Okay.' thank you, deputy. 'Yeah, you're welcome.' you can call me Holden. Hey, sorry, I've had a really busy day I didn't get your messages until now. - Are you okay? - I don't know. It was a crazy day. I'm just ready to go to sleep. Do you really think it was Frederick that attacked you? I don't know. I do know it wasn't his car. But he was so angry today, he was my best guess. Hey, how about you come on over? You can stay with me until you figure things out. Uh, it's okay. I'm on my way to a motel. - Are you sure? - 'Yeah.' 'you have a lot on your plate' with the new listing and I don't wanna be on the way. It'll only be a couple of nights until I find a new job. Have you been looking? Yeah, I have a potential interview tomorrow. I'm just waiting to hear back. That was fast. What is it for? It's another live-in au pair gig. They're usually pretty hard to find, I guess I got lucky. Well, hopefully you hear back soon. That sounds like it could be a great opportunity. Yeah, at least I won't have to worry about paying rent. Not sure I'll ever find kids as good as the Cargills'' though. But you will find better employers, that's for sure. You'll be okay, mags. Thanks, girl. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Hi, I'd like a room. Just one night? Yeah. Let's start with that. Well, it's $60. Cash or card? Card. I don't have my wallet. Mm, I'm sure we can work something out. You know I-I might have some cash actually. I have 55.

I called the bar and deputy Hayes and nobody has seen it. Oh, Holden Hayes? - 'You know him?' - Yeah, I sold him his house. And I'd gladly lose my wallet if it gave me access to that handsome man. Wasn't he at the bar the other night giving you the googly-eyes? You saw that? Why didn't you say anything? I'm not gonna let no prince charming interfere with the first girls' night I get in a month. Fair point. Well, I guess that means I only have one phone call left to make. Yikes. Have fun with that. And good luck with your interview. I know you're gonna kill it. Okay. Thanks. If you're calling to beg me for your job back you're wasting your time. That's not why I'm calling. 'Well, if it's about your belongings, I have a driver' packing everything up as we speak where would you like him to drop it off? 'I'm staying at the pine motel.' but again, that's not why I'm calling. - Well get to the point. - 'My wallet is missing.' I think I may have left it there yesterday. Have you seen it? Hm, I'm not sure. Not sure? Have you seen it or not? No. Has Kristen or the kids seen it? 'No.' did you even ask them? - Who was that? - Telemarketer. Poor lady was out here walking her dog when it started digging, they found the bones. How long do you think she's been here? About a year. Clothing's still intact and she was dressed for the winter. Tell the me I want the autopsy report asap. You got it. Johnny's seven, we've already got him playing soccer and football. Tom's four, and before you know it, he'll be out there with him. Well, my cleats still fit so I’d be happy to practice with them. They would love that! So, uh, Maggie, what got you started in child care? Well, I was in a foster home and started babysitting when I was 16. After that I never wanted to go into another field again. You resume says that you got your bachelor's in social work. Why'd you go back to au pairing? My end-goal is to work in child protective services but I need my master's degree for that and I didn't have the money at the time. However, I'll be attending southern Connecticut state this fall. I hope that doesn't affect whether or not you'll hire me. Of course not, we would never wanna get in the way of you getting your master's. 'We'll worry about the fall when it gets here.' now, um, Jamie and I will probably wanna discuss this tonight when I gets home, but it seems like you're really a great fit for us. Thank you, that's great. Just a moment. This is Mike. Yeah. Okay. Really. Uh, thank you. Thank you. Maggie, I think you need to leave. - I don't understand. - Don't make this difficult. Just please leave. The victim is an unidentified female in her 20's. She's been dead for about a year. Now we don't have any missing person's reports matching her description, so we think she may be from out of town. We're currently comparing dental records and trying to determine the cause of death. We have no suspects at this time so I need all of you on your toes. We'll know more once we ID the victim. But, um, until then, let's get out there try to figure out who killed this girl. Alright. It was Frederick. I know it was. 'What do you think he said?' I don't even want to know. I can't believe he's treating me like this. 'Did he ever find your wallet?' nope. It magically disappeared right after I rejected him. 'Why do you think he took it?' 'it's not like he needs the money.' no, it's power, that's all he cares about. Anything he can do to get a hold over me. Hannah, I'll call you back. Hello? Maggie, it's me. Hey, is everything okay? I, uh, found your wallet. Oh, great. Where was it? In the trashcan. Figures. Listen, can we meet before I pick up the kids? Are you sure Frederick would be okay with that? He won't know. Um, just come by the school at dismissal time. Uh, yeah. Okay. I'll see you then. Thank you so much. I'm sorry he lied to you. Doesn't that bother you? Of course. I know how Frederick can be. But I also know that he's a good father he loves his children. I need to ask you something. Frederick doesn't happen to own a red sedan, does he? No. Why do you ask? Someone's been following me. And it's not just that. I think they're trying to kill me. What? Maggie? I think it might be Frederick. That's ridiculous. Is it? No, I know he's not a Saint but, Maggie, trying to kill you? Why would he do that? Kristen.. ...the other day when he took me into the study he wasn't just talking to me. He tried to.. Look, he already stopped me from getting another au pair job. I think he's angry at me for rejecting him. Did you contact the police? Yeah, I filed a report but they can't do anything without evidence. Listen, I believe you. But you have to be careful. He can be dangerous. Okay? Is it okay if I say hi to the kids? Oh, honey, I don't think that's a good idea. I don't want them to slip up and tell Frederick they saw you today. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll-I'll go. Uh, Maggie. Just protect yourself. ♪ Stop that ♪ ♪ stop that ♪ ♪ stop that ♪ ♪ yeah I am trapped in the noise ♪♪ - Holden. - 'Are you alright?' somebody's at my door. They're trying to get in. - 'Where are you?' - I'm at the pine motel. Room four. 'Okay. I'm close.' 'I'll be right there.' hurry. Whoa! Whoa! Where is he? - Who? - The red car, it was just here. I-I don't know, I didn't see anybody. He was just trying to get in here! - You just missed him. - Okay, alright. Okay, will you give me the bat please? He was just here, Holden. Okay, I believe you. You're okay. Come here. You're safe now. You know whoever it was did a number on your car but it's okay, we-we'll get it fixed. It's okay. How'd you get here so fast? Uh, I was responding to a call right around the corner. Here, let's take a look at this see if we can catch this license plate number. Damn it. - What's that? - What? It looks like some kind of sticker. But I can't make out what the symbol is. Good spot. That'll help us with our Apb. Yeah, you might as well just go straight to Frederick's house. Maggie, we've been over this. I can't just go around pointing fingers without evidence, alright. He bought me that car when I first started working for him. Why would he destroy a car that he bought with his own money? Frederick has plenty of money. This is just his petty revenge. Revenge for what? I don't wanna talk about it. Not right now. Alright, look why don't you go back to bed and I'll stay outside and I'll keep watch? We can go get your car fixed in the morning. Thanks, but, um I think I'm just gonna stay with my friend Hannah. I don't feel comfortable here anymore. Okay. I'll give you a ride. Come on. 'Yeah, I can fix it. Just give me couple of hours.' great. Thank you. What the hell happened? Okay. Alright, whatever. It's gonna be $980.47. Hi, Ruth. I don't know if you remember me from the other day? Of course I do. I didn't catch your name though. - I'm Maggie. - Well, welcome back, Maggie. Can I get you something to eat? Oh, no, thank you. I'm actually here about the sign out front. Are you still hiring? Well, I got one server on maternity leave I can definitely use the help. You have any experience? I don't have any experience waiting tables. Most of my experience has been in child care. Well, that's okay. I can teach anyone to wait tables. The tricky part is getting along with people. Well, that sounds like a great fit for me. Okay. Well, you seem like a sharp girl. So, why don't you come back tomorrow and we'll get you trained. Can you do that? I certainly can. Thank you. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. See you then. - Maggie! - Maggie! Hey, guys. It's so good to see you. Come on, kids, we must get going. - Ah, say goodbye to Maggie. - Is everything okay? Frederick will be catching up with us soon. - You better go. - When are you coming back? Oh, I don't know, guys. But I miss you, too. Okay, come on, kids, time to leave. I don't want Maggie to go away like the last au pair. What happened to the last au pair? Goodbye, Maggie. Come on. ♪ I don't mind the slow down ♪♪ I'm concerned for their safety. What are you gonna do? I don't think there's anything I can do. I know you love those kids. But at a certain point you might just have to move on. They're not a part of your life anymore. I refuse to accept that. At the very least, I can make sure they're safe. One sec. Hello? 'Maggie, it's Ruth from the diner.' hi, Ruth. What can I do for you? 'Listen, you seem sweet' 'but I'm afraid I've had to reconsider hiring you.' 'the position's been filled.' oh. Uh, okay. Can I ask why? That son of a.. Miss, excuse me. Miss, excuse me. You can't go in there! Miss, you can't be in here. - No, no, it's... - 'I'm sorry.' - no, no, no. - I tried. She's come a long way. Let's hear what she has to say. Will you gentlemen excuse us? Hey. Frederick, this needs to stop. I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been blacklisted from every job in town! What are you telling these people? Nothing that isn't true. Look, I'm sorry how things turned out. But I feel I was very reasonable in giving you my notice and just because I wouldn't have an affair with you doesn't mean you get to ruin my life! How am I supposed to go to grad school if I can't get any work? Well, I sure wish I had an answer for you, Maggie. That's quite a predicament. Frederick, fix this for me. I'm willing to forget everything. Just undo whatever it is you told these people. You know, it's funny. Just a few days ago I was the one begging you. Now look at you. So pathetic. Get out of my office before I have security drag you out by your hair. Boyd Thomas. He's a local junkie with a history of muggings. They think he snuck in. You know, it's a good thing you know how to handle yourself. That's not the same guy from the motel. How can you tell? The other guy was smaller and wearing a black hoodie. Plus do you think some grimy guy like that would own a red sedan like the one we saw on the video? You know, you're right. Boyd doesn't even have his driver's license. And the guy's clearly on something. He was wearing shorts in the middle of winter. By the way you look cold. Do you wanna go get a cup of coffee? Are you seriously trying to hit on me after I was almost mugged? No. No, no. I just, I-I just wanna make sure that you're okay. Relax. I'm messing with you. - Coffee sounds great. - Alright. I know of a good spot around the corner. - Okay. - Come on. I'll do a coffee with cream and sugar, please. And I'll just have my black, thank you. Be right back. - Thanks. - Okay, thanks. Anyway, I was in and out of that foster home for most of my life. And that's where you met your friend Hannah? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hanna's parents died when she was one. We used to joke about who had it worse the one whose parents perished in a car crash or the one whose parents didn't want her. Okay. Well, uh.. I see where you get your sense of humor from. Yeah. You know, in my experience, um.. ...parents don't abandon their kids because they don't want 'em anymore. They do it because they know that they can't provide them with the life that they deserve. And look at you, huh? You've got a good head on your shoulders. The foster program done you some good. Ah, Hannah and I are the exception, believe me. You should've seen some of the other people we grew up with. It's a terribly broken system.. ...which is exactly why I wanna become a social worker. To help kids like me. Well, I think you turned out pretty great. 'A lot better than me, let me tell you.' - oh, yeah? - 'Yeah.' - what's your baggage? - Um, you know.. Nothing except I'm an insomniac. I'm a workaholic. And I don't have a social life. Hm. Didn't you kinda sign up for that? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I did. But, um, you know, no amount of TV can really prepare you for the reality of it. It's like I'm working on this case right now. We're trying to identify this Jane Doe who is my sister's age. And every time I look at that photo I can't help but think.. ...what if that happened to her. I don't understand the evil things that people do in this world anymore. Tough line of work. Yeah. At least I don't have to work with children. I'm kidding. I actually love kids. Well, I don't have to work with kids either at the moment because Frederick has seen to it that nobody in town will hire me. - Not even for a diner job. - Yeah. You know, I really wish I could help you with that. You know, you keep saying that. But I think there are things you can do. Stop letting guys like Frederick get away with this. Maggie, I.. Thank you. Look, Maggie, I wanna help you but Frederick hasn't done anything illegal. Actually.. ...there's something I didn't tell you. What is it? He...touched me. What? I didn't wanna say anything before. I guess I was just scared. 'When did this happen?' when I gave him my notice for the fall. He put his hand on my thigh.. ...and he tried to.. Maggie...I'm so sorry. Do you any proof to corroborate his guilt on this? Proof? How am I supposed to prove something like that? Maggie, you gotta understand that in my line of work I need evidence, and then I can do something about it. You're one of his, aren't you? What? He's got you under his thumb just like everyone else in this town! What're you talking about? When you stop being scared of Frederick and wanna start doing your job, let me know. Maggie. Maggie, Maggie, wait. Can I have the check? - Hey. - Hey. You alright? I don't really wanna talk about it. Okay. Well.. ...i have something that might cheer you up. I got you a job. - What? - Yeah. Where? at my place. no way. And welcome to your new office. It's a pretty easy gig. The company is being growing so it's starting to be too much. We just need someone to answer phone calls respond to emails, schedule appointments stuff like that. Hannah, I can't thank you enough for this. It's no sweat. And the best part is I have plenty of time to find someone else before you go to school. You're the best. Aw. And I'm literally just right there if you need anything but you're gonna do amazing. - Okay? - Okay. Love you. Autopsy report for our Jane Doe. Dental records ID'd her Ashley Coleman from Boston. And strangely, she was never reported missing. Do you know anything about her vehicle? No trace of it. My guess it's buried somewhere in the Housatonic River. Did you notify the family yet? That's next on my list. Think you've got enough on your plate. - I can do it. - Let me know. ...hey! Ready to go? 'Yeah.' - 'thanks for waiting for me.' - Of course. - You did great today. - Thanks. I could get used to this for the time being. Yeah? I just want you know how much I appreciate you giving me this job. Are you kidding me? You know I have your back. And besides I get to see my best friend everyday it's a huge benefit for me. Still, I owe you one. Yeah, you do owe me and I'm never gonna let you forget it. Maggie, stop. You're my best friend. That's what friends are for. You wanna go? - Yeah, let's go. - Let's do it. Ashley was always a troubled girl. Um, Ms. Coleman, I just have to ask why you never reported her missing? I didn't know. We barely talked after she ran away. Do you know anything about a 2020 blue sedan that Ashley drove? 2020? No. She could never afford anything that new. I just wish I could talk to her one last time. Please, find out who did this, deputy. I will, Ms. Coleman. You have my word. That was so good. Dinner and a new job? What did I do to deserve you? I know. I'm kinda the best. - Wait a minute. - It's Kristen. Put it on speaker. Put it on speaker. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Hello? - 'Maggie. I need your help.' oh. Uh, what is it? 'My mother fell and I'm at her house taking care of her.' 'but now Frederick says he needs to leave for business.' 'can you come watch the kids? Just for tonight?' um, I-I don't know. Last time I saw him, he called me pathetic and threatened me. 'I'm so sorry.' 'but we really need you.' 'and the children would love to see you.' 'we'll offer your weekly rate just for the night.' 'how does that sound?' um, Kristen, I'm gonna have to call you back. Do you think it's a trap? I don't know. It's really strange. He's never left for business at night not while I was there. But if it were a trap, I don't think Kristen would go along with it. I trust her. Don't do it, Maggie. I'm gonna keep the kids safe. Plus, I could really use the money. What if he tries to pull something? I have an idea. Come on in. Maggie! Hey, guys! Are you here to live with us again? No, Maggie is just here for tonight. - Aww. - Hey, but don't worry. We're gonna have so much fun, okay? Yeah, not too much fun. I want them in bed in an hour. Okay? It is a school night after all, right? - I understand. - Okay. And, um, I don't know when I'll be back, but it will be late. So, if you get tired, feel free to sleep in your old room. Maggie...thank you. Come here, guys. I missed you. What do you wanna do first? Hey, guys, I need to ask you something. The last time I saw you you said you didn't want me to go away like your old au pair. What did you mean by that? Well, when the last au pair left us we never saw her again. Yeah, she didn't even tell us that she was leaving. Why'd you ask? Just curious. I made this special for you. Aw, that's so sweet. Thank you. Now, who wants to play some games? Me! Excuse me. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Um, I'm detective Hayes. And don't worry, you're not in trouble. Um, I was actually hoping you could help me out. I'm sure you've heard on the news that we found a girl's body in the woods a few days ago? Yeah, I heard. It's a real tragedy. Well, we've identified the body um, as, uh, Ashley Coleman. Ah, it turns out she was here a couple days before her death. Oh, yeah, I remember her. She was in last winter. What do you remember about her? Not much. But she was probably rich. She shelled out a lot of money. Mm. It's interesting. Um.. Here, let me ask you, do you remember uh, what kind of repair she had done on her car? Oh, she didn't have any repairs done. It was a new paint job from blue to red. - Blue to red? - Yeah. - Thank you, Aaron. - Sure. Ha! Kohen, your turn. 'Sorry, I missed you.' 'leave a message and I'll call you back.' Maggie, it's Holden. Listen, I know you're upset with me. But you gotta call me immediately. Okay? You might be in danger. Oh, no! Kaeden lost! Alright, guys, time for bed. But I'm not even tired. I'm sorry guys, you have school tomorrow. Come on, let's go. I miss playing with you, Maggie. Me too. I miss playing with you, too. Oh, my god. Damn it, Maggie. Pick up! 'Hey, it's mag..' - Holden. - Oh, Maggie, thank god. - Where are you? - I'm at the Cargills''. They asked me to watch the kids. Listen to me, take the kids and go, now. What's the matter? That Jane Doe that I've been trying to ID she was Frederick's au pair before you. 'And get this, she drove a red sedan.' I think Frederick killed her and then took it. 'And you could be next.' Hannah, this is all my fault. I can't believe I put you in harm's way like that. I don't even know what to do anymore. If I knew this was gonna happen I would have never given the Cargills' my notice. Hannah? Hey, Maggie. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course. Are you alright? I'm fine. It's Hannah I'm worried about. I'm sure she's gonna be okay. - Did you find Frederick? - No, we haven't yet. But we do have an Apb out on him. And we will. Trust me. Did you bring those photos? Yeah. Right here. Yep. That's her. Holden, I'm sorry for blowing up on you the other day. I wasn't even thinking straight. You don't have anything to be sorry for, alright? I should have listened to you. If I had then, if I had then maybe this wouldn't have happened to Hannah. This is not your fault. - I gotta take this. - Mm-hmm. Hello? Yeah. Okay, great. I'll be right there. We just arrested Frederick. - Oh, thank god. - Yeah. I gotta go down to the station. Yeah, okay. Just drive safe, it's icy out. Okay. Mr. Cargill. What am I doing here, deputy? This is absurd. You're being accused of murder, Mr. Cargill. I suggest you cooperate if you want this to run smoothly. I had nothing to do with the death of that girl. Where's my lawyer? He should've been here an hour ago. You don't need a lawyer, Mr. Cargill. You got nothing to hide, right? 'Just gonna ask you a couple questions.' and help me solve this case. So, what was your relationship with Ashley Coleman? She was my au pair. And how did her employment end? - I terminated her. - Terminated? - I fired her. - For what reason? Do I need a reason to fire my employees? - 'No, I suppose not.' - Thank you. 'But you fired her and two days later she shows up dead.' it's not a good look. Well, what can I say? She wasn't a good fit for the family. Is that why you fired Maggie Ford? What are you talking about? Have you ever tried to have sex with any of your au pairs? I'm a married man, deputy. Well, that never stopped anybody before, right? You got pretty girls living in your place 'running around 24/7.' okay, this is ridiculous. Maggie put you up to this, didn't she? - 'No, she didn't have to.' - You sure? 'Yeah.' rich guy buys his au pairs jewelry and then he tries to have sex with them. It happened to Ashley. Now it's happening to Maggie. Ashley was murdered, and now someone's after Maggie. It's a strange pattern, don't you think? Where is the car, Frederick? The red sedan. What use would I have with a beat up sedan? I only buy luxury vehicles? 'You know what interests me the most' is what happened with the previous au pairs? It-it seems like they all went on to live pretty normal lives and ended their employment with you quite peacefully. 'Why is that?' are those the ones that said yes? I have never taken advantage of any my au pairs and I certainly have never tried to kill them! Well...you're gonna have to explain these. We got a little tip that these were hiding in your master bedroom closet. I sent a squad car over there today. Are these your previous au pairs, Frederick? I'm not saying another word until my attorney is present. Maybe that's smart. I'll let you look over these. You want a cup of coffee? 'I'm good.' Okay, come on, guys. Hurry up. I want you to get inside. Let's go. You're all bundled up, okay? Is Hannah going to be okay? Hannah's gonna be fine, don't you worry, okay? Now give me a big hug. Oh. I want you guys to have the best day, okay? Go get inside. Hurry. Bye, guys. Hello? Maggie, I just returned to an empty home. I cannot get ahold of my husband. Where are my children? I just dropped them off at school. Oh. I see. I go out of town for one night and now you're back to replace me. Put Frederick on the phone. I'm not with Frederick. 'I'd like to speak to him.' Kristen, Frederick isn't here. Well, where is he? 'Wait. You didn't hear?' heard what? Deputy, you must understand that these photos turn up on the same night that my disgruntled ex-employee stayed the night at my house. Surely, there's some bias involved. We're supposed to, what? Just take her word for it? Well, how else is she gonna get pictures of those au pairs in that room? Until the photos can be examined for legitimacy... Oh, give me a break! You have no grounds to hold my client! Why don't you have an alibi for this morning when Hannah mcnulty was attacked? I mean, you told Maggie that you were going out for business but you didn't interact with anybody? The court of law is only concerned with guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Last I checked, lack of alibi doesn't fit that criteria. It's true. Where are the children? I told you I took them to school. How could you take them to school when their father is in jail? Honestly, Maggie it's like you're not even thinking sometimes. Kristen, wait. Kristen. How many of those have you taken? Not enough. Look, let's just sit down, okay? I don't wanna sit down. Has Frederick been hurting you? How often does this happen? What do you care? You want him all for yourself. What are you talking about? He doesn't think I'm a good mother. That's why he hires you and all the other girls. They can never keep their hands off of him! Where is this coming from? I already told you. He is the one that can't keep his hands off me! Oh, please. You enticed him. They always want him because they're jealous of me. Kristen, Frederick has been gas-lighting you for years. So much that you'll believe anything he says. Maggie, you silly little girl. Don't you think he's capable of murder? You don't have to hide anymore. Frederick is in jail. He killed that girl! I saw the proof in your closet. You raided our closet? Aren't you glad I did? I can't believe that we let someone like you into our home. Kristen, listen to yourself. I can practically hear him in your voice. Hello, dear. Maggie. What.. What are you doing here? What, you didn't really think those photos would be enough for them to hold me, did you? Frederick. Go upstairs. - But I... - Now. Do you have any idea what you've done to me? Hmm? To my reputation? No? I am Frederick cargill. I control this town! I will not be put away like some petty crook! That vase costs more than your college tuition. You know something, Maggie? I didn't even kill that girl. But I think I will kill you! Kristen. Thank god. On, come on, pick up the phone. 'Hey, it's Maggie. Sorry, I missed you.' 'leave a message and I'll call you back.' Maggie, we had to let Frederick go. He could be after you! Damn it! 'Kristen.' Kristen, what the hell are you doing? I'm taking Maggie's advice. 'I'm standing up for myself.' you think I don't know about your affairs? We weren't having an affair. I saw the way he looked at you. It's the same way he looked at Ashley. It was you. You killed her, didn't you? Even after he fired her he was obsessed with her. He couldn't let it go. I couldn't bear the thought of everyone laughing over their shoulder that you left me for some young au pair. I thought that if I got rid of her then things would go back to normal. I could be the perfect wife. The perfect mother. But then you hired Maggie and the cycle repeated itself. Because that's all you are, Frederick. Just a pathetic, predictable man who can only think with one tiny little body part. Did you predict this? You should have stayed away from us. I can't believe I ever felt sorry for you. Maggie! Maggie! You okay? It's okay. I got you. It's alright. It's okay. Well, we found the red sedan. It was parked in the back garage. I'm doubt even Frederick knew it was there. I've never met a more toxic couple. No wonder they fell in love. Yeah. I guess some people just get lucky. You know, if we never would've come together we wouldn't have found the killer. We make a good team. Hey, so, I know you're gonna be busy with school soon but I was wondering if.. You know, I was gonna do that. - Are they almost ready? - Almost. Guess who just submitted their deposit? Ah, congratulations! - Eww! - Ah, come on. Does that mean you're leaving in the fall? Well, by then we'll have found some awesome foster parents for you guys. You know, we don't have to rush all that. I gotta take this. Hey! How are you feeling today? Better. Just ready to get out of this place. I'll be there in about an hour. I just have to take the kids to school first. Okay, well, hurry up! Because I have a really bad itch that I can't reach. Hang on, I'm getting another call. Okay, see you soon. - Hello? - 'Maggie?' 'Hey, it's Mike Milton.' look, I just wanted to apologize for the way the interview turned out the other day. We had no idea that the Cargills' were like that. I appreciate your call, but it's okay. Don't worry about it. Listen, if you're still interested in the au pair position, the job is yours. Thanks, but I think I'll pass. Alright, how are the pancakes, guys? They're delicious. Did they pass the test? - Did they? Did he burn them? - Yeah, yeah. - Do you want? - Yeah, I love them.
