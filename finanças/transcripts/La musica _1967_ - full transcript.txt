THE MUSIC What is this city, sir? - Mister, where are we? - Sorry? How do you, Mademoiselle? It's half past four... Thanks. I must have left the national road without knowing it. I didn't see where it was. You're going to Deauville then? It's on the main square. You couldn't have known... Of course, it's your first time here. The first time, yes. Why "of course?" Because... It's the main road... Deauville is there. It's a vacation route. - You're coming from... - From Orleans. - You're American? - Yes. My father works at SHAPE. I'm not coming directly from Orleans, - I'm coming from Paris. - Ah... Yes, I stayed there 4 days. I'll remember them a long time. Are you waiting for someone? - No. Why? - You seem like you are... No... You were saying? If you're not waiting for anyone, can I move to your table? That's quite alright... I was about to kill myself, I was so bored. As bad as that! Is it better now? Go ahead and doubt me but it's true all the same. I'll believe you, if you want. Is it yours, the Triumph over there? Yes. I'm going to Honfleur. - You know it, of course? - Yes, very well... I'm going to meet a friend. You should go and see Boudin's paintings in Honfleur. Eugene Boudin... Do you know him? No. Vaguely, yes... no. I know him well. He's a painter who always made me think of Goya. There are marvelous transparencies. Something austere... The light, maybe. He painted scenes of the beach at Trouville. Women on the beach... It's very beautiful. I'm thirsty. Could I have another beer? Waiter! Two beers please! - I'm sorry, I should have thought of it. - That's alright. - Do you live here? - No... I'm just passing through. I leave tomorrow. Well... You're not sure that you don't live here? Yes, I'm sure. Because I live in Paris. You came because of a death, perhaps. - No... - Excuse me! No, no, it's... And you're going back to Paris, not the other way by any chance? No. I'm going back to Paris. If you were going to Paris I would leave with you. Really? And you would want to go back right away, to Paris, now? Definitely, yes. - You're not sure. - No. We don't always do what we want. Not always. Then, sometimes we don't know, either. That's true. For example, when you come to see your family... It's not that. I don't know anyone here. I'm here on business. Are you satisfied? No. - Are you leaving? - Yes. I have to. I'm on vacation. - And you won't finish your beer? - No. - I'm sorry. - Why? Maybe you want to go see a movie? No, why would you ask me that? Mechanically. Excuse me. After all, I told you I was going to Honfleur. - And you, you have nothing to do? - Nothing. And your business? It's finished. Done. Look, because if you're really going to the movies... Absolutely not. You don't want to go to Honfleur? There could be trains, at night, for Paris... No thanks. - But since you have nothing to do... - No. But in fact, do you want to leave or stay? I don't want anything! Leave me alone. Will you wait for me? I want to buy a souvenir for a friend. I'll go across the street to make a call. Just a minute, I'll be right back. City Hall... The theater... The museum... Over there, the commandery, we went there on Saturdays, in the spring. Rouen - over there... The Seine valley - over the hills... Over here - the road to Paris. - New York? - Ah... There! The Atlantic Ocean... New York... The Pacific Ocean... China... - And it begins again... - Why, yes! You remind me of someone I met here several years ago. - Is that so? - Yes. An Englishwoman passing through. If I remember it right, she went to Rouen. She was writing a thesis on Saint-Maclou. Norman Gothic. - What do we have in common? - Indiscretion. I didn't realize, perhaps. - What are you singing? - "Winter Journey" by Schubert - And you, what do you do? - Biochemistry. I got my diploma 15 days ago, I'm done. - How old are you? - 22. Okay, well, I'll drive you to the hotel and I'm leaving. But what are you thinking about all the time? Oh, it would be hard to say. Is that true or you're lying? Maybe I'm lying. Is this where you met that young girl? Does that interest you? Like that! I lived here for four years. I worked on the reconstruction. You see these buildings on the hill? We built a lot here a few years ago. Now it's slowed down. But this young girl, you never saw her again? Imagine... I even thought I had forgotten her. You're the one who reminded me of her. You're very curious, aren't you? Yes. Does it bother you? No. Do you mind? - You don't know what you want? - No! It's just that you might have to wait a long time. Well you know, I didn't set a time, I said I'd arrive in the evening. Say, that young English girl... was she very free? Definitely. We went to the hotel. It was marvelous. Simply... - It was nothing? - Nothing. I loved another woman. But it was wonderful. And where was this other woman? Away for the afternoon. Today, I would listen to anything. She's gone. She's beautiful. Yes. She's not very young anymore... Who is it? Someone I know. Listen... I don't know if I'll come back out. Yes, I'm very tired. I think I'll sleep. - If you'll excuse me. - Of course! I'll wait a little bit, and if I see that you don't come back, I'll leave. What do you want? To stay with someone. That's all. - See you later, maybe. - Maybe... Excuse me, ma'am... Coming! You're sure that there's only the 9:15 train for Paris? Definitely. That's the only train that stops in Evreux. Maybe you have a client going back tonight who could take me? I don't think so. Could you make a phone call for me? Littre, 89-26. - You want me to send it upstairs? - No, no. Here. Still no response... Will you keep the room tonight? I don't think so, no. Evreux has changed so much, it's amazing! I don't go out too much, you know, so... See you later. - I wanted to tell you... - Yes? About the furniture that's in storage... I could arrange for it to be sent to you. To save you the trouble. What furniture? Oh yes... Oh, I don't know what I'll do with it yet, if I'll keep it or not. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Is this Littre, 89-26? Stay with me! Your number, sir! Thank you. - Hello. - Is that you, Michel? Yes. Are you OK? Yes. Is it done? - Yes. - When? This afternoon. - It wasn't too difficult? - No. - You saw her again? - Of course. - So? - Nothing. What do you want me to say? - It's just... - What? The whole thing is exhausting. Has she changed? Yes, without a doubt. Will you tell me about it sometime? Why not... But who knows... Maybe some day. OK, I'm going. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What are you doing tonight? Nothing. I stayed in bed the entire day. - Where does she live? - I don't know. This place is at the ends of the earth, but at least you sleep. - Will you take me there some day? - Why not? - Until tomorrow, my dear. - Until tomorrow, Michel. While you were on the phone, the woman went back into the hotel. She came back out right away. Then she went across the square, as if she was going to the cinema. Over there. Does she like the cinema, that woman? I think so. - Where do you want to go? - I don't know anything here. - Let's go to the forest? - If you want... Where are you going? You're scaring me! Why? Don't come any closer! You won't take me back to Evreux? Why did you bring me here? I wanted to see this spot again. You're fixated on something, I don't know what it is. If you don't tell me what it is, I'll leave you here. Go ahead, it doesn't matter. We're a half-hour from Evreux, I have nothing to do. But what's wrong with you, then? Leave me alone. Go back to Evreux. Leave me in peace. Sit here. What's wrong? What happened? - I'm tired... - Because of what? Because of what? - You don't want to talk about it? - No. Did you do something bad? Yes. To whom? To myself. Come on, let's go back. Wait a little longer. Come see... The castle of Shakespeare's kings. There was a whole army. Look, how they suffered. Him too. - Where did you find this? - At the foot of the tree. - No. - No... What happened to you in Paris? I stayed in a hotel room for three days without going out. I've never been so alone. Last night there was a wedding party in the hotel lounge. I was just above, I heard everything. I was alone in my room... People were saying outrageous things... enjoying themselves. They laughed... laughed... It doesn't interest you, what I'm saying. - No. - That's fine with me. I wanted to talk to someone, to a stranger. Who are you kissing in my place? It doesn't bother me, you know. What time do you need to be in Honfleur? I told you there's no set time. Anyway, I'm tired of my friend there. Frankly, it's a man who I have to go see. I'm going to end things with him. Now do you understand why I'm lingering like this? You don't love him anymore. I didn't say that! I don't know, I'm not there yet. Maybe it's the opposite. How can you be sure? You should know... Is that why you approached me? No. Why did you bring me here? I wanted to see what there was inside. I haven't ever cheated on him yet. Foolishly... I should have! You wanted to? Yes, to see... - Isn't that what cheating is? - Yes, it is. Why did you leave Evreux? Because I got divorced. It's not possible to live here alone. I preferred to go back to Paris. And her? I don't think that she lives in Paris. It seems like I would know. Why did you get divorced? I don't know anymore. I understand... It's like with me and this man. It's not the same at all. In no way. That's true. And then, I don't have enough experience yet. You still have the wedding ring? It's another woman. You can't get away from it... You'll see. - She's the one who you called? The second one? - Yes. Naturally she's younger than the other. Yes, she's 24. And she's more beautiful too? In a way, yes. - How so? - She must look better in public. - And elsewhere? - Less so... Less presence... She has less presence. That's mysterious, isn't it? Yes. If we went to a hotel... it could be pleasant... I don't know if I want to... Oh really? What do you want to do instead? I have no idea... Anyway, I don't know if it's you who interested me or your story. - What story? - Your story, right now. It seemed like you didn't know you were living it. The moment has passed. Over in a few seconds. Tell me what you're doing in Evreux. What good could it do? I came for the judgment of a divorce. It was this afternoon. - And it's finished? - Yes. It's completely finished? Yes. We wanted to see clearly. Afterwards we understood very well what happened. What happened? I couldn't tell you. I don't want to know... There's one thing that I don't really understand. - Oh, leave it... - No. You knew she was coming to Evreux. I thought so. And you also knew she would come to that hotel? Yes. In French they call that "being at the turning point of your life." A bit further than the turning point. There's a new road, and I've started walking again. You're starting to get the idea. Who left first, her or you? No one. It was a mutual decision. What did she say? She said, I love you. For the moment that's all. And it wasn't a lie? No, not so much. And the woman you're with now... do you love her? Yes. But there are others after... After what? After your wife in Evreux, there are others... I spoiled my chance at happiness. As it turns out. Happiness? Maybe... Forever, you mean? Maybe. "I spoiled my chance at happiness..." But what will you do? I don't know. Why don't we talk? Why should we? Nothing is more finished than that, of all the things in the world. Including death? Do you believe that? I don't know. Maybe, yes. Including death. Nothing is more finished than that, of all the things in the world. Even if we were dead? Including death, you think? I don't know. Maybe, yes... Including death. Yes? Come in. Madame, are you there? Excuse me, Madame? Yes, coming! I wanted to tell you that I'll keep the room tonight. Yes. Could I ask you to send this telegram for me? Of course. It's urgent. She didn't leave? This is 07-53, Evreux. She didn't leave? An urgent telegram... You're going to kill her, perhaps. Maybe she deserves it. I don't know your story. Besides, it's none of my business. Where were you? - It was raining... - I didn't see you come back. - Everyone's asleep. - It's late... No, it's the provinces. I was wondering where you went. I stayed in my room. That's true, it rained... I thought you had left the hotel. A young girl was here a moment ago. She was looking for you, I think. Where are you going? I don't want to detain you. I met that young girl at a cafe. And we spent the afternoon together. - Where is she in fact, do you know? - No. I don't understand what you're saying. Where did you see her? In my room... she came there about an hour ago. She talked to me about you. - How indiscrete! - Yes. Imagine, this little American felt alone. She found someone in Honfleur... A man whom, according to her, she no longer loves. But in my opinion it's not true, I think she was making it up. I didn't have that impression, but I guess it's possible. The town has changed, did you see? The hills have been built over... it's done. It's not the same landscape anymore. Especially towards the East. That's true, it's not the same landscape anymore... They were supposed to have built an airfield. Do you remember? They must have given up the idea. Where would they have gone from here, Paris is so close! Have you been back to La Boissiere? - You too, no? - Yes. I don't think I ever saw you. I often passed by here the last three years, without stopping. I never have. It's the same you know. I looked for you tonight. I walked several kilometers around the city. Everything was closed. It's always the same. - The nights here are deadly. - Oh really... - Tell me... - Tell me! I didn't think the house had been sold to such young people. No, it must have changed hands since then. There were two people eating together, I had never seen them before. It's a strange feeling. The dining room was in the same place, the television too... They weren't speaking, not a word. That's true, it's strange. They finished the building I started. Remember, behind the station? Not really. Oh yes, I see. That's good. It seems like the plans were respected. I should have gone to see the site from time to time, but I didn't. - Is your work still going so well? - Not bad... - Are you still as passionate about it as you were? - No. - But... But, what do you mean? - Nothing. You're probably taking the train tomorrow morning? No. They're coming to get me. Imagine, I don't even know where you live. Someone asked me the other day what became of you, I didn't know what to say. For the moment nowhere, honestly. Here and there. In the North especially... In the North? Yes, it ended up like that. Not that it bothers me, by the way. You still don't like the South? No, I still don't. What's that? Someone's coming in. I haven't heard anything about you for three years. Me, I get news now and then, from Valerie. - You've seen her? - Yes. I've completely changed my opinion of her. You can take up the cause for someone without being unfair. That doesn't prove anything except, perhaps... that you're under their influence... Without even realizing it. I also see the Tourniers sometimes too. That's all. I didn't think you would come alone. You came alone as well. - Yes, I thought it wasn't worth the trouble... - Yes, that's it. "Including death"... Do you really think so? You said there was nothing more finished than that, including death. I said that I didn't know. When you came back from Paris I was waiting for you on the platform. Will you re-marry? What happened on the platform? I'm leaving for America. I'm going to go live in America. Where I can be calm. It's a little late, I know, I'll have to move fast to make up for lost time. So now you think that time doesn't always have to be lost? It's just a manner of speech, I never thought about it like that. At all. Really. And you, what will you do? Something like you, probably. Except that I have to stay in France for my work. And otherwise? I don't know yet. You haven't changed... I've gotten older, you know that. I wasn't talking about your face. But yes, your face has changed a little. - How so? - Your look, I think. You had a very gentle look. And then when we met I knew ahead of time what you were going to say. It must have been tiresome to always know ahead of time, like that. At the end... In the final months... it was very tiresome. To know that you would lie. - It's late... - No, stay! It's incredible that we can talk to each other like this. Do you remember the last months? Hell. Yes, hell. - Maybe this dog belongs to the hotel, we should have let it in. - No. Something as bad as that only happens once in a lifetime. Referring to what? That hell. I think so. Or else this experience, this abominable thing wouldn't have any use. Oh... I've thought about it since then. It's like one hasn't found... another way of... Of escaping fatigue, for example? Yes... I think so... How long did we stay in this hotel before we moved into the house? I don't remember how long it took to get it ready. Three months? Six months? Three months. It's strange, that we remember so poorly... There are some moments that are clearer than others. But I think that what there is behind the moment is also part of the memory. You don't always know. There are moments that are absolutely clear. The hell, for example. Yes. A way out of the tunnel? Some kind of reconciliation? Yes. No, we shouldn't have gone to live in that house, we should have stayed here, in this hotel. Maybe... I don't know. Live in a hotel? Go from one hotel to another... like people who are hiding. - Like lovers! - Maybe. In the end we had no reason not to be like everyone else. We were young... Married, with everyone's consent. Everyone around us was happy with it. Your family, mine... We had a house, furniture... The ring you don't wear anymore. We should have done like everyone else, it's true. Well, we were like everyone else! There was no reason to act unusually. And we ended up in the same place as many others. Yes, sometimes a divorce occurs. Or something else. What? Another woman. Things last a long or shod time, until they have to end. That's what your supposed to tell yourself... Like all the rest. Yes. How stupid... - What? - Nothing... Always the same story. Are you going to America alone? You don't want to respond? No. I realize that it's inevitable. You'll start over, if you haven't already. I started over. Now we know the end of the story. - The end... - Yes, the only one. And we also know that we can do without this... third act. And you know, we were very, very young. It's understandable. We don't want all that trouble anymore. Or all that worry... We changed. What do we want? Nothing. But in different ways. We used to not shrink from anything... Why "yes," Why "no". It cost us nights of insomnia... Scenes... scenes... All that drama. And something else as well... - What? - Look at this... - Yes, yes. - When? When you asked for the divorce. But it wasn't serious because I'm here. It was surely only a vulgar blackmail. I had no idea. You couldn't have known. Maybe it's contradictory, but I asked them not to tell you anything. Of course, if I had succeeded you would have heard about it. It's terrible... But no... You don't think that this action was so terrible. In that castle in Bohemia, you remember, you told me that for you, this world was bearable because this action was possible at any moment in your life. You didn't think about what you just said. Valerie didn't tell you, did she? - She knew? - Yes. Why tell me now? It's a pan of your past all the same. Now you should be able to learn it, it's fair. Why are you smiling? Because of Valerie. She's usually so indiscrete. So you see... You spoke about death in a way that was maybe... rather light, earlier. What? Oh, you know it well... It was often. Even during good times. You don't understand anything. Valerie told me about her. She's very young, isn't she? That's good. A young girl perhaps... - We should go to sleep, they're waiting to close up. - Who's waiting? Maybe it's for you. Or for me. Hello? Yes... Sorry? Oh, he's left, Madame, I'm sorry. In the afternoon. You're welcome. I couldn't tolerate anything from you, but I was unfaithful. Yes, Valerie told me about it. And don't you think it's a little unfair on my pad? No, not unfair... Different... Difficult at first... Very hard... And then... understandable... You wouldn't like it if I told you about it. It's not worth it to go over all this, we should go to bed... It's the last time in our lives! Have you thought about it? Did I scare you? No, not really. Tell me what happened in Paris. Please, I have to know! Someone's coming. Tell me something about that trip! Tell me something about that trip... There are people... They made the changes they had planned here... This marble is idiotic... Everything looks the same... they ruined everything. Tell me. Make it up if you want, but tell me! They kept this painting that we liked so much... - "The Women on the Beach"... - Tell me! It was... another man, not you. Most importantly it was someone else. On one hand there was you, and on the other, all the men I would never know. I think that you must understand perfectly. Yes. It think that at that point, we were even. It's true, we were. It's strange to hear the truth three years later. It's interesting. I'm not asking you about anything. I suppose what you told me about your trip to Paris was false. Stop walking about. You! You wouldn't be able to handle the truth. Now, with time, maybe you think you could but you couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle anything. Almost nothing... Nothing. And I still can't handle it very well, as you can see. What happened in Paris? Why talk about this trip, precisely? Why deprive ourselves of the truth now? I met him at the bus station. Afterwards he waited for me in front of the hotel. Once, twice... The third time he scared me. It was late... In front of the hotel again... It was 1 AM. There you go! - Where did you go? - Dancing. You didn't know that either, did you? No. I danced occasionally. You don't dance, I missed it. I think I missed it a lot. Even if I danced it would have been the same. Most likely. You know, it's terrible to be unfaithful for the first time. It was dreadful. It's true, the first time, even a fling was dreadful. It's completely untrue to say that it doesn't matter. I don't think that for a man faithfulness could ever be so serious. Is it because of him that you lengthened your stay? Yes. Did you want that to happen or was it really by chance? I wanted it. I was hopeless. I wanted to... rediscover... the first moment... The first time. That's all, like you. To get back to the first moment... The moment that nothing can replace. And you know... The taste for having adventures like that comes from someone. Your way of being faithful... didn't seem fair in the end. Did you rediscover those first moments? You always do. More or less. And that's why you didn't want to come back? I want to know that. At least that... You really want me to tell you that? No! Excuse me. Listen... A few days before that trip... you didn't know... I saw you pass in the street. There. I followed you. It was in the afternoon. I left my office to go to the work site. I saw you go into a movie theater. I followed you. I went into the theater... They showed a film that you had already seen with me. Oh really? You were alone... You sat in the front row. Nobody came to meet you. That night we said nothing about it. I didn't ask you anything. It was springtime. Three years ago. You were already sad sometimes... You were starting to suffer... to be afraid... The next day after breakfast I asked if you were going to go somewhere. You said no. But you went out. I followed you. You went to a kennel. Maybe I was interested in getting a dog. It's true, I did things like that. - And you still do? - Yes. - And he doesn't say anything? - No. - He accepts it? - I don't know. I went crazy. I had you followed every day for a week. An you didn't find anybody. No. Not that it made any difference. It was terrible! I was jealous of you. I didn't recognize you anymore. One day you went into a forest. I followed you. You were superb! Alone in your car, you were going fast. I waited... hesitating... I should have joined you... but I left. It's one of those absolutely clear memories that we talked about earlier. But it's nothing! Nothing! That's how I pass my time. I forgot that walk. You should have joined me. I thought you would prefer to be alone. Sometimes, yes, I preferred it. - Don't defend yourself. - I'm not. That's what you're doing. You're strange. Why shouldn't one do things like that? Of course! But why say nothing about them? It would be misunderstood. That's less serious. I don't see the point of saying such things. You're unbelievable! After all, we're free. Words. You weren't. At night you could say, "This afternoon I went to the movies." These are the things you don't do at the beginning... - Then, when you start doing them... - It's already too late. Yes. Some people cry in the afternoon when love starts to fade. I go to the movies. - Your number? - 12. It's stupid... You'll be tired tomorrow. - What time are they coming? - Around nine. - Is it someone I know? - No. What happened on the train platform? On the train platform I wanted to kill you. I bought a gun. I was going to kill you when you got off the train. You would have been acquitted. - You had nothing to lose, you knew it... - I think so... I was well aware of that. - Why didn't you do it? - I don't know. - You're lying! - I don't remember. That night you disappeared from the house. I went to Cabourg. I threw the revolver into the sea there. I thought you threw revolvers in the sea... I'd read it somewhere. - And crime as well? - Indeed, about crime as well. Me too... about adultery in Paris. Did you really throw away that revolver? - Don't shout. - The hotel is empty! I loved you... That means nothing. Do you think so? I don't know anymore. What happened, did you want it? Or was it by chance? You already asked me that question. No, I didn't want it. And you were desperate? The novelty swept away the despair. Hello. Who do you want to speak to? Yes, he's in. Just a moment please. Are you there, sir? - Answer. - No. Yes, he's here. Hello? Yes, I'm listening. Yes, it's me. Sorry, I didn't recognize your voice. What's wrong? I couldn't... Because... I don't hear you very well. What did you say? I couldn't stop myself from calling... What have you been doing? I went to the movies. Then I wandered. I went for a walk. All this divorce business is so painful. I was worried, I'm sorry. Don't worry, my dear. You know... you didn't have to go. The judgment would have been the same. It's called a "judgment by default". - Do you hear me? - Yes. An idea came to me... with a terrible strength... that's why I called you: to ask you why you went there. Tell me something! Tell me something! To see her again. I knew it... 30? - Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Absolutely sure? - Yes. - You're still coming back in the morning? - Oh, leave me alone... Leave me alone. I still can't bear the idea that you didn't want it. - Did you hear? - Yes. That's why I came. To ask you what it was like. The same as it was for you. The same. Wonderful? You remember, it was the same. - Yes? - Hello sir, pass me the woman from room 12 who was with you earlier. Yes. For you. - Hello? - Hello, is it you? - Yes. - I was just about to leave when I got your telegram. - Where are you? - At a truck stop. I left anyway. I'm very close. Less than an hour away. - I'm coming, do you hear me? - Yes. - Your room number? - 12. Why did you stay? Tell me! Tell me why you stayed! Come! Come... now! - It's impossible. - No! I can't accept it. You mean, now? No, in the past. - I can't. Do you understand? - No. No! When you say you came to ask me what it was like... you're lying! You mean... Not really... I also wanted to see you again, but I knew it would be pointless. Pointless. Indeed... I couldn't even come close to you without... without suffering. What can we do to make these memories less... painful? Nothing more, I think. Only killing you would have done me any good... And you see... That young girl from earlier, you know... She warned me. She told me not to stay in the hotel tonight. Is that why you stayed? Yes. I don't think you're risking much now. I've become a criminal without work. It's completely ridiculous. Now that the divorce is final, you would be crazy! Yes, I know. But I think I was wrong... It's not killing you that I want... but knowing! Listen... before that other man comes... - we still have a little time. - No. - Listen! You won't tell me everything that happened? Everything? You want me to tell you about happiness. Yes. The abominable. You're mistaken... You've forgotten your adventures and you want me to remember mine, but it's the same. - You think I've forgotten them. - Yes. No... It's not worth it for us to be together... whether we're together or apart... from now on... it isn't worth making them suffer... Don't go to America! Don't go, I beg you! Or else I'll come live where you are. To hell with my work! I'll move to the town where you are. - And make your life miserable until... - Until that hell stalls again? I don't give a damn about that hell! And neither do you... you don't give a damn either! Stay in France. That way we can meet, even if only by chance... So that it's not completely impossible. At least we'll be in the same country. Otherwise... it will be unbearable. We can arrange to meet far away... in the provinces... - No one will ever know... - No! No! No! To want it, to do it deliberately... No! Like you said before... yes. If we meet again, it will only be by chance. Like with the others. We'll see how fate manages things... No other way. Never again any other way but by chance! You'll make it. I can't leave you. But we are divorced. Never again. Even if we see each other again. If we're dying? Not even then. It's not worth it. We're not like those people who think it's so serious. I don't understand what's happening. What can we do so that you and I... What could happen? The answer is... do nothing... Invent something... That. In the shadows... Let our love grow in secret? Yes. That's it. Like people kept from loving each other. Yes. Look at me. I am the only woman who is now forbidden to you. My wife. Yes. - We'll see each other again? - I don't know. - But if it ever happens? - I don't know. But if ever, once again, you and I... That day... we'll die. Like lovers do. It's not possible that we could live together. - Die? - Yes. Like lovers do. What is happening? - When? - Now. - Is it the beginning or the end? - Who knows. Go and wait for him outside. Yes.
