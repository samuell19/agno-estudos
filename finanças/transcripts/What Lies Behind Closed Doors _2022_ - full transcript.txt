[ominous music] [crickets chirping] [woman] There's someone here. [hushed sobs] I think they wanna kill me. [whimpers] [approaching footsteps] [sobs quietly] I don't know what to... [door knob turns and creaks open slowly] [woman] I can't talk, he's coming. [breathing softens and quiets] [slow approaching footsteps] [woman breathes erratically] [creaking] [ominous music continues playing] [door creaks open] [woman screams] WHAT LIES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS [gentle piano music] [birds chirping] - Hey! - Hey! You finished so fast, I didn't think I'd see you. What? You think I'd just go enjoy my summer without saying goodbye? Yeah, if you bombed as badly as I did, then yeah, I'd steer clear. [Kimberley] What? Hey! [giggles] You're not gonna say anything to reassure me? Like, maybe you did really well? Oh... So, you want me to lie to you? Yes, obviously. [chuckles] You already know, I think you aced it. Um, if I did, it is all thanks to you. - Oh, come on! - No, seriously. You helped me out this semester, even though you didn't have to. I really appreciate it. It was sweet. Of course. I gotta get going. I have that interview. For the nannying job? - Come on, don't be like that. - [scoffs] What? I know you want Mr. Aaron as your thesis advisor, and he decides on proposals in two weeks. I'm just thinking about your time. Well, Lacey moves out for the summer and I have to cover her rent. This is the only way I can think to do it without letting it eat into my grant. Well, if you need some money... Yeah, Gabe... Thank you, really, but I worked too hard to get here myself. I can't let someone else be the reason I can stay. Plus, it's just part-time. It won't take any time away at all. Well, then... Go get 'em! Good luck! Thank you. [melodic piano music continues] [car pulling over] Oh, wow. [chuckles] [car door shuts] [doorbell rings] [door bell rings inside] [footsteps approaching] [door opens] Hi! You must be Kimberley. Yes. Mrs. Davis? Please, call me Caroline. You're early. Oh, yeah. Just a few minutes. I figured that it would be better than the alternative. [chuckles] Yeah, I wish my husband felt the same way. He was supposed to be here with our son. I wanted you to meet him. Oh? Well, I can come back later if that works. No, no, that's fine. I think they'll be here any minute now. I um... [running footsteps] Hi, Mike! Second mile? Looking good! [chuckles] He is a major gossip at the country club. Always be nice to him. In fact, be nice to everyone. They have eyes all over around here. Of course, always. [chuckles] Come on in, okay? Yeah. So, you're a student, right? Yes, at Oakridge. I am studying Business and Finance. I was in that program. - Really? - Yeah! [exclaims] The work! Drove me crazy. Do you know what you wanna do with your MBA yet? Yes, consulting and community development. I wanna help small businesses keep from getting swallowed up by big corporations - before they start to grow. - Oh! My mom got pushed out of her business when I was a kid and it was really hard on her. So, yeah, just wanna be able to help fight back the next time that happens. Wow, that's noble. With a streak of vengeance. Yeah. [laughs] Exactly. [Caroline] I like it. [Kimberley laughs] Excuse me. [sighs] It's just been so hectic with work lately, I swear. No, it's totally fine. [texting] "Yes, I will be there." My company asked me to join them on a five city sales trip leaving Monday, so, it's been a bit of a scramble getting everything sorted before I leave. So, you said this Monday? Yes, which is why we are looking for a nanny, someone that we can trust so that I don't have to worry when I'm out of town. Well, you can definitely trust me. Yeah? It'd only be afternoons, just until Steven gets home from work. We signed Jasper up for this morning day camp program, but it gets out at one, and Steven works until five. Okay, so I would just need to pick up Jasper and watch him until Steven gets home. Exactly. It's not too much, right? No, no. I would be worried if someone thought that was too much. [chuckles] Well, yeah, you'd be surprised. [scoffs] We had somebody else lined up for the job but um... it didn't work out. Oh. You know what, will you just excuse me? I just... I'd like to reach my husband and see where they are. Yeah. I really want you to meet them. I'll be right back. Yeah, okay. [car engine purrs] [Steven] Home, sweet home. [ominous music playing] Let's go, son. You got everything? Oh, yeah! Hey. [Steven] Mom's got a new friend she wants us to meet. Come on, let's go. [Kimberley] Hey, sweetheart. What's your name? I'm Kimberley. Go on, kiddo. Introduce yourself. I'm Jasper. So, you're Jasper. It's very nice to meet you. And you must be Steven? Yes, nice to meet you. He can be a little shy at first, but once you get him talking, good luck trying to stop him. Well, that sounds like me. [chuckles] Jasper, I was looking at these photographs. Do you have a favorite? Will you show me? Oh yeah! I know that place. - What's it called again? - That's the Alamo. [Kimberley] Oh, that's right. The Alamo. Where is the Alamo? Texas. [chuckles] I love Texas. - Did you have fun there? - Yeah, but it was super hot. And they put cheese on everything. [chuckles] I love him. [chuckles] Hey kiddo, why don't you run upstairs and go watch some TV so we can chat. Okay. [whispers] She's way better than Aunt Britt. [Caroline chuckles in distance] Sorry, Aunt Britt? My sister. Remember how I said we had somebody else lined up for the job that we had to let go? - Oh, no, I'm so sorry... - No! No, no, no. It's fine. I... I don't know what I was thinking. 'Cause we were never close. So, I just thought maybe, as adults, I could give her a second chance, but she still lies and does who knows what else. She just really can't be trusted... [whispers] Caroline. Sorry. Don't be sorry, I get it. Trust is hard, and if she wasn't willing to work for it, then she didn't deserve it. You know you're perfect for us. You know all the right things to say. What do you think, honey? Well, I think we should ask her whether or not she wants the job. [ominous music] [bugs chirping] [Kimberley] What do you think I said? I said yes! [Gabe over phone] That's great! Congratulations. So, how's the family? Are they pretty cool? They're amazing. The kid is so cute, the dad is super chilled. The mom is themost boss business woman I've ever met. And get this, she did our program! What? At Oakridge? - Yeah, like ten years ago. - Crazy. [Kimberley sighs] Gabe, I think I just lucked into the mentor of a lifetime. Well, I hope you're celebrating. Well, I'm about to put a TV dinner into the microwave, so, yeah, it's a party over here. [chuckles] No, we grabbing dinner tomorrow night and celebrating properly. I wish, but Lacey and I are doing one last ice cream movie-thon before she leaves. Oh, so you are celebrating? Okay! You joke, but it really is an event for the ages. Alright, well, how about Monday after work? Then hopefully, we can also celebrate you not getting fired on day one? Mmm, so much confidence! Um... Yeah, that sounds great. It's a date. It's a deal. It's a deal. [ominous music playing] It's a deal. [Gabe] Have a good weekend. You too. [phone beeps] [gentle piano music] [microwave beeps] [Caroline] Will you remind him to brush his teeth? - [Steven] Yes. - [Caroline] Okay. [Caroline] Okay, sweetheart. Listen to your dad, okay? [Jasper] Okay. [sighs] Okay, you're gonna have so much fun today. Don't give your dad a hard time, and be good for Miss Kimberley. She's picking you up from camp today, okay? Okay, I know. [parents chuckle] I'm gonna miss you so much! I'm gonna miss you too, Mom. Can I go and get my stuff? Yeah, go. We'll be fine, I promise. We got a good nanny now, we'll talk everyday. You just go out there and knock'em dead, alright? I love you. You too. [Steven] Stay safe. [engine starts] [car door shuts] [car drives off] [Steven] Jasper! [text notification tone] [message tone] [message tone] [texting] [message tone] [message tone] [cellphone vibrates] Caroline, is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm just headed to the airport. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you needed. Yes! Keys, phone numbers, addresses, schedules. I have everything. [Caroline] You're a life saver, you know that? Of course, that's what you hired me for. So, it's your first time leaving him? Can you tell? Don't worry, I will take great care of him. Hey, is it alright if I bring over some ice cream? I know it's like, the first day of camp, sometimes that's hard. Yes! Yes, that's a lovely idea, You know, nobody's home right now, you could take it over whenever you want. Can I give you some money? - Oh no, this one's on me. - Really? Are you sure? Yes, absolutely. Have a great flight! Okay, will do. I'll check in when I land. Bye. [slow melodic piano music] [music continues playing] [woman laughing] [kissing noises] [man and woman laughing and kissing] [suspenseful music playing] [clack] - What was that? - I don't know. Wait here. [quietly panting] [suspenseful music continues] [suspenseful music continues] [woman] Hey. Is everything okay? Just thought I heard something. I thought it was him. Don't worry. We broke up. Yeah. That makes me more worried. I can handle Nick, okay? But it is kinda sexy you wanna protect me. I'm glad. It's a lot of work. [panting] He didn't see you. You're okay. [sighs under breath] Oh, God. [gasps] Jasper! [panting slightly] Well, maybe I can make it worth your while in the meanwhile. [sounds of kids chatting] - [boy] Bye, Jasper! - [kids] Bye! [other cars revving up] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music continues] [birds chirping] - [Counselor] Is that her? - [Jasper] I think that's her. I am so sorry! - [Kimberley] Thank you! - You're welcome. Hi! Did you have a good first day? You're late. Hey. Did you have fun at least? Jasper, come on. What did you do? Did you make any friends, play any games? Look, I'm really sorry. Can we please talk about this? Where were you? I took a wrong turn and I got lost. That sounds like something just made up. No, it's not! Listen, I really wanna make this up to you, okay? Is there anything you wanna do, anywhere you wanna go? I just wanna go home. Okay. We'll go. [ominous music playing] [music intensifies] Almost there. [Jasper] Don't be late next time. [music intensifies] [Jasper] Hey, why is Dad here? I don't know. Jasper! No! Wait. Dad! Jasper! Hold on, Jasper! Jasper, no, no, no! Jasper! [Kimberley] Wait, Jasper! [Steven] We'll talk soon. Alright. Hey, buddy! What's up? - How was camp today? - It was awesome. Yeah? I'm glad to hear that. Everything okay, Kimberley? Yeah, sorry. I just wasn't expecting anyone to be home. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't text you? The AC went out at the office, so we all decided to work from home. That makes sense. - Hey, Dad. - Yes, sir? - I'm hungry. - Okay. I'll make you a snack. Okay. [Jasper] Hey! Ice cream. It's melted. Oh, um, [chuckles] I'm sorry, bud. I picked some up on the way home because it was so hot. I just forgot to put it away. I'm sorry. So, we could've saved it if you had just picked me up on time. [ominous music playing] So, you were late today? Yeah, I got held up. Held up by what? Look, just try to better tomorrow if you could, okay? Trust is very important to us. - Of course, I will. - Thanks. In the mean time, I'm already home. And I don't think you're gonna have any better luck with him today, so... Why don't you go home, and we'll try again tomorrow, okay? Okay, yeah. Can't believe I left this out. Seven dollars... down the drain. [water splashing] [Steven sighs] [cellphone vibrates] [sighs] [ominous music continues] [cellphone vibrates] What are you talking about? [man] Is it true? Nick... - What are you doing here? - I wanna know who he is. - It doesn't concern you. - Of course it concerns me! [Serena] No, it doesn't, Nick. We're done. We have been for months now. And if you still don't understand that, I'm gonna have to call the police and have them explain it to you for me. - Serena, wait! We just... - Go home! [Nick] This isn't over! [suspenseful music] - [suspenseful music playing] - [doorbell rings] [sighs] Oh, Gabe. [Kimberley groans] Dinner. That's not quite the reaction I was expecting. No, I'm sorry. Come in. [sighs] Gabe, I am so, so sorry. I completely forgot about dinner. That's fine. Are you okay? I mean, you didn't really get fired, did you? No. I didn't get fired, but it is so much worse. Wow. Okay. Well, now I have to know. Look, Gabe, I'm sorry. Is it okay if we just reschedule? I just really don't feel like going out. Yeah, that's... that's fine. Let's just order in. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you, I'd like that. So, what happened? You are not going to believe it. Let's order first. [Gabe chuckles] [Gabe] He's having an affair? But he didn't see you, right? [Kimberley] If he did, he didn't say anything. Well, that's probably good. It means if he did, then he wants to forget, as much as you do. I don't wanna forget it. I wanna tell Caroline. She deserves to know. I don't think you should do that. What? Why not? Because you don't know if she wants to know. Gabe, her husband is cheating on her. Everyone would wanna know that. A lot of people would prefer to keep what they have and look in the other direction. And that's a lot easier to do when you don't know anything about it. Just wait until you're sure. [cellphone vibrates] It's her. Well, okay. [stutters] Don't answer it. Gabe, I have to answer it, I take care of her son. Right, yeah. Sorry, bad idea. Um... Then just take a breath. You'll be fine. Okay. Hi, Caroline. How was your flight? [groans] Long. I can't tell you how happy I am to finally be in my hotel room. You know, my friends all think it's so glamorous, jetsetting, seeing new places, but they forget... It's a new airport every two days. You know what I mean? Kimberley? Are you still there? Sorry, I have a friend over for dinner, so, I was just excusing myself. Oh, okay, I'll let you go. I just wanted to know how the first day went. Um... Well... Uh-oh, doesn't sound good. No! Everything's fine. It's... I kind of messed up. I was late picking up Jasper and he's pretty upset with me. And I feel awful, and I promise I will make it up to him and you, if you'll let me. I'm really sorry. Thank you. You're thanking me. I knew you were late today, Kimberley. I had a voicemail from the day camp when I got off the plane. I'm glad you told me the truth. It means I can still trust you. So, let's just try and not let it happen again, okay? So, I'm not fired? No, no. [chuckles] You're not fired. Unless there's something you're not telling me. [ominous music playing] No, there's nothing else. [sighs] Well, okay. Well, listen, go back and enjoy your dinner. We'll catch up soon, okay? Alright, yeah. We'll talk soon. [cellphone rings] [ringing stops] [ominous music continues] [instructor] Alright, deep breath, guys. And hold. Keep holding for a few more seconds. Release. And begin inhale, reach up. And exhale. And hand to the chest. Namaste. Good job. [Scott] Miss Serena? Scott? Wow, I haven't seen you since... My senior year in high school. Saved me from failing Spanish 4 my senior year. [Serena] I was just your tutor. You did all the work yourself. Since when did you start doing yoga? Since my latest philosophy class on how the physical being relates to the mental being. Sounds interesting. Yeah, it is. Well, it was nice seeing you. Good seeing you too. [cellphone vibrates] [multiple notification buzzing] Oh, somebody's popular. Yeah, not the way I wanna be. Nick found out I was seeing somebody and is pretty mad about it. Nick? You guys broke up like weeks ago. [Serena] Yeah, try telling him that. Does he know who your new guys is? [hushed] No! Okay. Neither do you. You know how people in this town talk. [instructor] You're right. I'm sorry. It's fine. He just doesn't want her to hear it from somebody else. Well, I'm... [text notification] I gotta go deal with this. Yeah, alright, well, will I see you in class on Wednesday? - For sure. - Alright. [suspenseful music playing] [bugs chirping] [clack] [suspenseful music continues] [music intensifies] [gasps] [suspenseful music intensifies] [approaching footsteps] - [Serena screams] - [slicing] [Serena groans] [music crescendo] [fading footsteps] [running water] [tense music] [sips] [outgoing ring tone] [tablet ringing] Mom! Hi, kiddo! How are you? Good. Can I go watch Dinosaurs? Jasper, can... How was camp? What did you guys do today? [Steven yells] Jasper! We gotta go, bud! I'm talking to Mom on the tablet! [Steven] What? I'm talking to Mom on the tablet! Oh. [chuckles] Hey! I didn't realise he called. No, no, it's fine. I called, actually. Oh, of course. Listen, we're running late and he's not even ready yet. Can we call you back tonight? - Yeah, I... - Okay, good. Love ya. - Love you. - Alright. Come on, dude. We gotta go! Let's go, chop, chop, chop. Come on. [tense music playing] [cellphone vibrates] Oh, hello! Good morning. And good morning to you! Have you checked your grades? No, are they up? As of this morning. Okay, I'm logging in right now. What! [Gabe groans] Ooh... How bad is it? No, it's not. I got a 98. Really? Yes, oh my God, 9... I got a 98, that's an A in the class. What did you get? I got a 94. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you saying that you tutored me, but I did better than you? What? Are you gonna rub it in? Yeah, absolutely, as much as I can. [sighs] Gabe, seriously, thank you so much. I could not have done this without you. I think you've proven you could have, but if you want to thank me, come have brunch with me tomorrow before work? Alright. Yeah, if I owe you. Oh, you do. So I'll see you then. Okay, yeah. See you then. [suspenseful music] [gentle piano music] [Kimberley] Cool. "Serving up a streak of revenge to corporate America." That's perfect. [typing] [woman] Jasper! [suspenseful music] Stay right there, okay? [whispers] Hey. You're the one who's been following me. He'll never be safe with you, you know, Kimberley. What? How do you even know my name? Miss Kimberley? - Hey, stay right there, okay? - Miss Kimberl... Why were you talking to Aunt Britt? That's who that was? Mom said she went away, and now she's back. So, your mom was trying to give her a second chance? Was she mean or something? No, not to me. Just to her. She said she was... - Biful? - Spiteful? All I know is one day I had an aunt, and the next, I didn't. Okay, okay. Grab your bag, okay? We're gonna go. [Kimberley] That was fun. Can we watch TV? Of course we can. And what about a movie? [Kimberley chuckles] Um... Your dad will be home soon, so how about TV today, and a movie tomorrow? And what about video games? We'll figure something out, okay? Okay. [dialling number] [ringing] [Caroline] Hi, this is Caroline. Please leave me a message. [beep] Hi Caroline. It's Kimberley. Can you call me? I had a run-in with your sister today. I'm not really sure how you'd want me handle that, whether I should call the police or... I... I just don't wanna assume, since she's family. Yeah, anyway, please call me back. Thanks. [beep] [doorbell rings] [doorbell continues ringing] - Hi. - Afternoon. - Can I help you? - Detective Alex Murphy. Bay City Police Department. I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time, Miss... Kimberley. Kimberley Marks. - Did you say 'detective'? - Yes. It's a routine visit, Miss Marks. No need to be alarmed. I was just going around the neighbourhood looking for some information on a Spanish tutor in the area named Serena Brown. I'm sorry, I don't know her. Well, maybe you've seen her around? [suspenseful music] Um... - Ma'am? - No, I don't know her. - But you've seen her around? - [Kimberley] Um... [Kimberley] No, actually, that's Mr. Davis. He's the homeowner here. I'm just the nanny. I think he can probably help you. [car door slams] [Steven] Hello? - [Murphy] Mr. Davis? - That's right. Steven. Detective Murphy, Bay City Police Department. I'm asking around the neighbourhood, trying to get information on Serena Brown. Does that name ring a bell? Yeah, that was my son's Spanish tutor. This card says homicide. Was Serena murdered? Very sorry, Mr. Davis. You don't seem too surprised. Yeah. Well, I wish I was. But, truth be told, is she had a boyfriend. He's pretty controlling. [Steven] I'm sure it got physical. We tried to confront her about him, and we didn't want him around our son. But she... She shrugged it off. She just dismissed it. She... She told us she had everything under control. Do you remember this guy's name? Yeah. His name is Nick Johnson. We actually had to call the police on him last December. They got a huge fight in front of my son, that was... That was the last straw, we had to let her go. I'm sure it's all in your files. Yeah, we'll look into it. So, you haven't seen her since that night? No. Not once. You definitely didn't see her yesterday morning? No. We believe she was in the area, so, we're just trying to put together a timeline. I'm sorry. But no, I was at work until lunchtime, and Kimberley was late getting here, so, if Serena was in the area yesterday morning, neither one of us would've seen her. Alright. I'll let you folks be. Oh, if you hear anything, give me a call. Of course. Thank you, Detective. [dog barking in background] Did Jasper hear any of this? No, he's been in the game room the whole time. Good. Would you mind staying for a bit? Help me break the news to him? Yeah, of course. He really liked her. Are you alright? Me? Yeah, it's... It's just tragic, but we did all we could do. Would you just give me a minute to get settled, and then I'll come in there to talk to him. Okay. [ominous music playing] [cellphone rings and vibrates] [Kimberley] Just when I needed to hear a friendly voice. Ooh, is everything alright? Yeah, it's just a long day. - I'm only just now driving home. - Wow. Yeah, I'll tell you about it tomorrow. We're still on for brunch, right? That's exactly why I'm calling. Do you wanna say my place at eleven? - You're gonna cook? - I'm gonna try! Yeah, that sounds lovely. Alright, I'll see you then. Thank you, see you then. [beep] [ominous music] [car hooting] [hooting continues] [Kimberley] Alright, alright. [Kimberley] Go around! [aggressive honking] Stop! Stop it! [honking continues] What are you doing? [honking continues] [tyres screeching] - [screeching] - [engine revving] [Kimberley] What the... [suspenseful music continues] [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music playing] [Kimberley] "I'll say his name. It's Nick Johnson. We dated for a minute about a year ago and he was crazy then too. I was scared when I tried to break up with him after only two weeks, so I can only imagine what he was like with Serena." [suspenseful music continues] [chattering in background] [Caroline] Thank you. [cellphone ringing and vibrating] Caroline. Can't believe you're still up. Tell me about it. We just had dinner with a client who would not shut up. I could not get out of there fast enough. [Caroline] But I mean, what were we gonna do? It would've been rude to just get up and walk away. Anyway... So, how are you? Is Jasper still awake? No, he went to bed an hour ago. I thought I would catch him with the time difference. How was your day? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, sorry, it's just been a long day. Do you wanna talk about it? No, no, I'm sorry. I should go. I'll get Jasper on in the morning, okay? Okay. I love you. You too. Good night. [beep] [sighs] [Kimberley] Hey Caroline, it's Kimberley. Can you call me? I had a run-in with your sister today. I'm not really sure how you'd want me to handle that, whether I should call the police, or... I just don't want to assume. Please call me back. Thanks. Wow! Look at you! You look great. [Kimberley] Caroline! I'm so sorry, I didn't realise you were calling. Kim, I'm so sorry. I don't mean to cut you off. I have a client here that I'm supposed to be meeting. I've only got five minutes, but I just wanted to tell you, if you see her again, you need to stay away from her, okay? And you know what, tell Steven, let him decide what to do. The tutor? No. No, my sister. Oh, right. Sorry. Are you saying she's dangerous? No, no, no. No. No, she's not dangerous. I would say that she's unstable. Well, I'm pretty sure somebody tried to run me off the road last night. Do you think it's her? I don't know any else who would try and do that, and if you're saying she's dangerous... Okay, you know what? I'm gonna call her and tell her she just needs to stay away from both you and Jasper. There's no reason she should be coming around. - Okay, thank you. - Of course. What were you saying about a tutor? - [Kimberley] Huh? - Earlier, you said something about a tutor, or... Oh! Oh, yeah, sorry. That was just because of all the police. What police? [suspenseful music playing] Did Steven not tell you? No, we keep missing each other. Oh, um... Well... I... I have to go. My client's here. Please remind Steven to call me, okay? Uh huh, of course. Have a great day. Okay, bye. [suspenseful music continues] Hi. [chuckles] Normally, people say hi, Gabe. Hi, Gabe. [laughs and stutters] Sorry, hi! No, thank you. I needed that today. [chuckles] Everything okay? Okay, come on. Let's talk about it. [suspenseful music playing] [Gabe] I saw the news about her murder. No wonder you sounded so defeated. Yeah, when I spoke to Caroline this morning, it sounded like she didn't even know about it. The murder? Well, did you tell her? I tried, but then she had a meeting and had to go. I guess Steven wants to tell her about everything all at once then. Everything? Think about the affair too? How could he not? If the police know, then she's going to hear it anyway, and he's gonna want her to hear it from him. I don't think the police know about that. You didn't tell the police what you saw? No, I couldn't. What do you mean you couldn't? Didn't you say that the police asked if you'd ever seen her before? Yes, but then Steven got home before I could answer. And then Steven told them that he hadn't seen her in months. Couldn't tell them then. He'd look like a liar. Of course he would. He was lying! Yes, but to protect himself and his family. Yeah, that's why people lie! Kimberley, what if he did it? Gabe! He's not a killer! But you don't know that! I know that he was upset. And caught off-guard. He might've been in love with her. Yeah, you think. But we're talking about real detectives here, whose job it is to actually find out. Kimberley, you have to tell them! Look, Gabe, I kept quiet because of what you said. Secrets destroy families. I couldn't do that to them. But this is bigger than that. Kimberley, if she died on Monday, then you were one of the last people to see her alive. Don't you think they should hear what you know before they make an arrest? An affair is motive! [suspenseful music playing] If you don't tell them, then I will. - What? - You can get in trouble for lying to the police and I cannot just sit here and watch you throw away your future. Okay. I'm gonna go. Kim. No. Not having fun here, and I have to get Jasper anyway. Kim! No! [suspenseful music playing] Kim! Kim! Just... Kim! What? Gabe, please don't do this. Kim! [engine starts] [dials number] [operator] 9-1-1, what's the nature of your emergency? [running water] [kids chattering in distance] This a picture of you and your mother? No, that's me and Miss Kimberley, and we're at the Alamo. [counselor] The Alamo? That sounds like fun. And who's this? [Jasper] That's Aunt Britt. She got out of jail and now she wants to take me away, but Miss Kimberley won't let her. [counselor] Criminal aunt, kidnapping, no parents in the photo. Just you to protect him. Usually when we see this, it means something is going on at home. No, thank you. But everything's fine. It's just been a difficult week. Because of Serena, his tutor? You heard about that? This isn't the only picture he drew. [gentle instrumental music playing] I'll talk to him. [instrumental music continues] [TV playing in distance] [cartoonish music from TV] [instrumental music continues] [Steven] Kimberley. Stay right here, I'll be right back, okay? Is everything okay? [Steven] Come here, please. What's going on? I'm here for some questions for you, Ms. Marks. - For me? - Yes, Kimberley. Somebody called in a tip. Gabe. You told somebody else my business? No, I just... as a friend, someone I could trust, or someone I thought I could trust for advice. And their advice was to rat me out before you talked to me? - No! That is not what... - You should've come to me first! Hey, hey, hey! Come on! Don't be too hard on her, Mr. Davis. She probably saved your life. What are you talking about? We already looked into the boyfriend before you brought him up, but we didn't have a motive to pull him in. Now that we know we have a motive, we've been able to detain him. And his phone is filled with texts to Serena threatening to kill her and whoever she was seeing. Weren't those texts on Serena's phone too? We never found her phone... I'm sorry... Are you saying she was killed because of me? Look, I'm sorry. I'm here for her right now, okay? Officer Lewis, can you take this gentleman outside for a statement? Do you really think he would've come after Steven? The ex-boyfriend? If someone sets out to kill two people, and they don't get pulled in for the first, then yeah. They start to think they can get away with it and they come to finish up for the second. [ominous music playing] I want you to tell me everything you saw. And don't leave anything out. Let's take a seat. [Murphy] Okay, well, thank you, Miss Marks. Probably won't need you to testify, but I'll let you know if I do. Yeah, of course. Whatever you need. Oh, and... please don't lie to the police again. Especially during the course of an active investigation. Alright? You'll wind up getting the wrong people in trouble. [Steven sighs] Am I leaving? Perhaps I think you should. Did you say anything to my wife about what you saw? No. I couldn't bring myself to do that. But you could bring yourself to tell your friends, right? No! Nobody knows. I only told Gabe, and it was a mistake. Gabe who? [Steven sighs] Am I fired? I don't know. Maybe. Obviously, Jasper still needs to be picked up. So, until I find a replacement, one I can trust, I guess you still have a job. Okay. I understand. [Steven sighs] [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music playing] Kimberley: I can't believe you did this to me. Enjoy your summer. [clang] [suspenseful music playing] [music continues playing] [click] [suspenseful music intensifies] Hello? What? [Gabe] Kimberley, listen. I want you to know that I'm sorry, alright? [suspenseful music continues] [Gabe] I'm sorry that I didn't talk to you first, and sorry that I didn't warn you. I'm sorry I lost my temper. [knife clinks softly] [Gabe] But I'm not sorry that I did it. Kimberley, I care about you, okay? And I couldn't just stand by and watch you risk missing your deadline for people you only just met. That wasn't your decision to make. [Gabe] You're right. And I'm sorry. I can see you're really upset right now, So, how about we take some time? But know that I'm always here for you. Have a good night. [engine starts] [Kimberley sighs] Gabe. [horror music] [Kimberley screams] [panting] [knife clinks to floor] [music intensifies] [Kimberly pants anxiously] [squeaking] [texting] [cellphone vibrates] [beep] Kimberley? [whimpers] Gabe. There's someone here. I think they wanna kill me. What? Get out of there! [quiet sob] I can't, please help me. Stay on the line, I'm on my way. [tires screech] [engine revs loudly] [hushed sobbing] Gabe, please, hurry. [whimpering] [door knob jangling] [whispers] Gabe, hurry. [squeaking] [suspenseful music continues] [Kimberley screams] - [panting] - [Gabe] Kimberley! - [screams] Gabe! - Kimberley! - Where is he? - [Kimberley sobs] - [Gabe] Stay here. - [Kimberly] No, don't! [Kimberley] Help! Someone! Please! Help! [Kimberley] Help! Someone! [screams] Gabe! [sobbing] [Gabe] He's gone, he's gone. Come here. [Kimberly sobs] Let's call the police. Okay? I got you. [sobbing continues] Thank you for coming, Detective. I didn't know who else to call. No, please. It's why I gave you my card, okay? How are you? Are you okay? I'm pretty shaken up, but yeah, I'm okay. Who would've even done something like this? I mean, could it have been the aunt? - The aunt? - No, that was a family matter. And that was taken care of. Well, I'm sorry to say that it's most likely connected to the fact that Kim is now a corroborating witness in a murder investigation. You mean the ex-boyfriend? Didn't you arrest him? He was detained, awaiting a formal arrest. His lawyers produced a somewhat dubious alibi at the time of the murder, so, until we can disprove it, we can't charge him. But why would he come after me? How does he even know that I exist? Well, when he was released, his lawyers requested a copy of the filed tip, and your name was on it. I mean, since the tip was that you knew more than you were leading on... It's my fault. Kim, I'm so sorry! [Murphy] The important thing is that you're safe, okay? And we've got a unit parked outside the Davis' family house, so he doesn't make a run at Jasper or Steven either. - Thank you. - Of course. [Murphy] Maybe you wanna try to stay somewhere else tonight too, if you can. [Gabe] She can stay with me. [Murphy] Okay. Good. Here, you can take this room. Really? Yes. I put you through so much today already, it's the least I can do. Go on. If you need anything, like a midnight snack or maybe someone to talk to, you know, whatever. Just come out and wake me up. I really don't mind. This is great, Gabe. Thank you. Hey, anytime. Gabe. Jasper's gonna be okay, right? I mean, with the patrol car outside, nobody's gonna try anything, right? He'll be fine, alright? I promise. You just need to get some rest. Thank you, Gabe. For everything. [emotional music playing] [sips] [tablet ringing and vibrating] Hi, Mom! Hi, sweetheart! How are you? - How's day camp? - It's fun. But there's been - a lot of cops, though. - What? Hey, we're just about to get on the road here. Steven, what's he talking about? I'll call you back, okay? [beep] Why did you hang up on Mom? [Steven] We gotta get going, bud. Um... Wait here one second, okay? [sighs] [sighs] Get your bag. Come on, let's go. Here. We gotta go. Let's go, bud. [bell rings] [suspenseful music playing] [Steven sighs] Alright bud, let's go. Got your bag? [Steven] Hey. Alright, I want you to have a good day today, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Thank you. [cellphone vibrates] CAROLINE:???? [phone beeps] What was he talking about? Serena died? What happened? Oh, you remember her ex-boyfriend? [sighs] Was she murdered? Okay, but I don't understand. Why does Jasper know about this? Well, Caroline, the police were canvassing the neighborhood and, you know, I realised he's gonna find out from the other kids anyways, so, we decided to break it to him. - We? - Yeah, Kimberley and I. She stayed late to help me with him. [sighs] Okay, I'm coming home. Hey, look, just focus on your work, okay? This trip is too big an opportunity to be giving it up for something like this. Okay? We'll talk later. Everything is going to be fine, okay? Wait, are you saying there's more to talk about? Look, I gotta go, okay? [sighs] [flowing water] [faint birdsong] [sniffs] [suspenseful music] [yells] You! [cellphone vibrates and pings] [voicemail] Hey, it's Caroline. Can you call me? [sighs] Steven's acting weird and I'm just now hearing about the tutor. I don't know, I'm just worried and I could really use some eyes on the ground to tell me what's going on. I'm headed to Philly today, but I'll be free after four, I guess that's what? One your time? So, call me, please. I'll keep trying you again. Bye. Wow. Okay... Did you call her back? Yeah, I tried. She didn't answer. She must already be at the airport. Well, he told her at least. That's something. I think he told her something, but that did not just sound like a woman who found out that her husband is cheating on her. What if she starts asking me questions? Do I have to out him? I hate to say this, but I think you need to talk to Steven. And say what? Did you tell your wife that you're cheating on her? Or should I? No, no. Just... Text him, and tell him she left you a voicemail and wants to talk. Just leave it at that and see what he says. I hate this. Yeah, this sucks. But they shouldn't be doing this to you. Hi steven, your wife just let me a voice mail - please call me. [Kimberley sighs] I gotta go. Do you want me to come with you? I mean, in case he comes for you? No, thank you. That's really sweet. Please be careful. See you soon. [suspenseful music playing] - [knocking] - [Kimberley gasps] [Kimberley] Hey. Hi. Buckle up, come on. We gotta go. [Jasper] Okay. [suspenseful music continues] [eerie music playing] Hey! It's Murphy. [suspenseful music continues] Hey! The police car's gone. Yeah. Maybe they found who they were looking for? [suspenseful music intensifies] Are you calling the police? No, I'm calling your dad. [ringing] [ringing continues] [voicemail] This is Steve. Leave a message. [dialling] [ringing] [voicemail] This is Caroline, please leave me a message. That's it. [Jasper] Miss Kimberley? Hey, Jasper, go back inside, okay? Okay. [door slams] [Britt] Is he here? [Kimberley] No! You need to leave. No, is he here or not? [yells] Steven! - You need to leave! - Steven! - [Kimberley] Hey! - What is your problem! What is my problem? You're screaming at the house! I... So you don't even know what's going on here, Kimberley! [laughs] I've been warning him, bad things are gonna happen if he does not stop seeing her. I told him! I told him what would happen to her if he didn't stop seeing her and he didn't listen, and now she's dead, don't you see? And now I'm worried he's gone and done something. [Kimberley] What do you mean "done something"? See! You don't know! And this is why you're not gonna be able to protect Jasper. Are you threatening him? No, it's not a threat. What? This is a warning. Like you warned Steven? Yes, it's not about them. This is about... Kimberley, this is about you! [Britt] Don't you see? I'm calling the police. - Wait, no! No! - Let go! - I can't go back there! - Get your hands off me! What do you not understand, Kimberley? I am trying to help you! I called the police, and they'll be here any second. [Kimberley] Jasper, go inside, okay? - Jasper? - Stay away from him! [Britt] I... [tyres screeching] [police sirens wailing] Okay, let's go inside. Come on. [suspenseful music fades] [click] [water splashing] [suspenseful music playing] [ringing] [voicemail] This is Caroline, please leave me a message. Hi Caroline, it's Kimberley. I haven't been able to reach Steven, and I can't reach you. Can you please just call me back? I just had a confrontation with your sister. Thank you. [cellphone vibrates] - Hello? - Kimberley. - It's Detective Murphy. - Detective, hi. Listen, what can you tell me about the woman your friend mentioned? The one you said was following you. Britt? She was just here? What? Are you okay? Yeah, I mean, we had an argument, but... [Murphy] About what? What did she say? Um, she... She was looking for Steven and she kept saying that she tried to warn Steven what would happen, but then she left when I called the police. Look, you need to get out of there, okay? You need to go somewhere fast, and take the boy too. Really? I think it's fine. She didn't try to hurt us or anything. - Kim, Nick Johnson is dead. - What?! Somebody wanted to make it look like a suicide, so whatever they're gonna do next, they want the police off of their back. What happens next? [Murphy] I don't know, but if she's looking for Steven, then I need to find him first and figure out why, and it's easier if you and the kid are safe. [Kimberley] Okay, yeah, we'll go right now. Okay, thank you. I'll keep you posted. [Kimberley] Doesn't make sense. You look scared. Everything's fine, okay, sweetie? Um, can you go pack a bag? We're gonna have a fun little sleepover tonight. But we just got home. I need your help, okay? Please, go pack a bag. - Okay. - I'll be right in there. [piano music playing] [beeping] [ringing] - [Gabe] Hi, Kim. - Hi, Gabe. I am so sorry to ask this, but I need a favour. [doorbell rings] Hi. Are you sure this is okay? Of course, yeah. Come in. Hi, buddy. [suspenseful music playing] Is everything gonna be okay? Of course! Everything is gonna be just fine. All you need to do is be a kid and watch some TV, and let the police sort it all out. Okay. Hang tight, I'm gonna call your mom and let her know what's going on. Get some rest. [Jasper] Okay. [suspenseful music continues] [voicemail] This is Caroline, please leave me a message. Hi Caroline! It's Kim. Please call me back. It's an emergency. We're in trouble. Have you tried her at her hotel? No, that's a good idea. I have a list. [ringing] [receptionist] You've reached the front desk. How can I help you? Hi, can you please connect me to a guest named Caroline Davis? [receptionist] Sure, one moment. Hm, it doesn't look like we have any guest by that name. - Are you sure? - [receptionist] I'm sorry, there's no Davis and no Caroline. [Kimberley] Thank you. [receptionist] Of course. What? She's not there. Well, what is it? 8:30 there? Maybe she's just not in yet? No, but they would have her in the system. Are you sure it's the right hotel? No, but, I mean, this is all she gave me. Call Boston. Maybe she hasn't left yet or something. Yeah, that's a great idea. Thank you. [Gabe] I'll look up other hotels in Philadelphia and see if she moved. [suspenseful music] Okay, well, thank you. What? They said she never stayed there. Well then, where's she been? [cellphone vibrates] It's her. Hi, Caroline? Hi, I only have a minute, but I heard something about an emergency. You only have a minute? Yeah, is everything alright? Are you okay? No! Caroline! Things are not okay! They haven't been okay! There's been a murder! Two murders! And someone broke in and tried to kill me! What? Oh, my gosh. Where are you? Are you okay? Are you at your friend's house? The police told us to go somewhere safe. [Caroline sighs] [suspenseful music playing] Caroline? [exclaims] What? She's so frustrating! Well then, what do we do now? I don't know, I guess just wait for the detective? Do you wanna call Steven? No. You don't think he did it, do you? No. But the police think that it was Britt. I mean we were just with her. She had her chance. I don't think it was her. Well then, let's just wait. We're safe here. [horror music playing] [Kimberly] Hey, Gabe. The sun was still up on Caroline's end of the call, right? Wasn't it 8:30 on the East Coast? Yeah, it was. I don't think she ever left town. Oh, God. Call the detective! [beeps] No, Gabe! [Kimberly] You dialled Caroline! [cellphone rings] [Kimberly] Do you hear that? [cellphone continues ringing] - [Kimberly] Caroline! - [Gabe] Whoa! [Caroline] Get back. Get back! [sighs] This was supposed to be soeasy. Fake a little trip out of town, and then handle my husband's little problem, come back, and no one would be for the wiser. [Caroline] That idiotboyfriend of hers would've lead the police in the wrong direction for years! They never would've suspected us had it not been for you! Cops? Sweetheart, what do you mean, cops? What cops? [Kimberley] So you killed him too? [Caroline sighs] Well, Steven had to go talk to Nick this morning and they had to work out their stories. [Caroline] I love you. [Caroline] If Steven walked away without a scratch, how could I convince anybody that Nick wanted to kill him? Caroline, why are you doing this? Do you have anyidea what it takes to be perfect? Do you? To live the life that everybody wants? To be the person that everybody wants to be? I am under constant scrutiny, okay? One little tiny piece of gossip could tear everything apart and ruin everything that I've built. - Just put the gun down! - Shut up! Then they'll have something over me. They'll start whispering behind my back. "Oh, she's so good at her job. Too bad she can't hang on to her husband." No! No, no, no! I won't have it. Hey! Back off! You think I'm not gonna use this on you, watch me. [Kimberley] Caroline, it's his affair! It's not your fault. Your friends would see that, then take your side! Clearly you've never spent any time in a country club. - What? - Wait, so... What's your plan? You're just gonna let it all fall on Britt? What would your friends think about that? Oh, you mean my unstable sister with a history of mental illness? The one that's been following my nanny all over town? - Oh no. - Shut up! Hey! I got the gun. Back off. [Gabe] Okay, okay. Okay, she was supposed to be my backup plan, but that little brat found out about Steven's affair and discovered that I wasn't really out of town, so she figured I was planning something. I... I tried to brush her off, I did, but then Serena ended up dead and she put it together. So, I told her that if she said anything, I would pin it on her. Hey! And I would do something even worse if she actually managed to convince anybody. That's why she didn't tell anyone. [Caroline] Oh, good. The plan's working. See, that's the thing about Britt. She'll keep running and running the rest of her life, just to keep from being committed again. And the more she runs, the more guilty she looks. And then Steven and I will be celebrated. Survivors. Asked at all the parties about how we triumphed over my jealous sister, who wanted a man that she couldn't have, so she set out to kill every women in her way. The tutor and my nanny. Think of Jasper, Caroline! Don't do this! You don't have to do this! Yes, I do. - No! - [Kimberley] Gabe! - [groaning] - [gunshot] [Gabe groans] Gabe! [metallic swish] - [metallic swish] - [Gabe exclaims] [Kimberley] Oh, my God! No! [sobs] So much for being noble. [Kimberley exclaims] Gabe! Caroline! I know you're in here! This time, you're the one going away. [Britt exclaims] You saved my life. You saved mine. [birds chirping] [fountain sprinkling] [gentle melodic music] [Steven exclaims] [Jasper] Look at these bubbles, Dad! That's pretty cool, son. - I second that. - Miss Kimberley! - Hi, Kimberley. - Hi. - Have a seat. - Thank you. How'd it go today? Good. The proceedings are finalised, custody's been sorted out, and as of August 1st, I will be officially divorced. That couldn't have been easy. No. No, it wasn't, but it's what needed to be done. Especially with Caroline going away for a while. What about Britt? How is she? Well, she's doing better now that she's out from under Caroline. Apparently, she had Britt framed when they were younger. Had her sent away, she'd been blackmailing her, periodically having her released into her custody, but only if she did everything Caroline wanted. Wow. I'm just now learning who Britt really is. I just hope she wants to be part of our family after everything. You know, be a part of her nephew's life. Who wouldn't wanna be a part of his life? Okay, well I'm glad you said that, 'cause we'd like you to stay on with us. And once school starts, the days will be covered, obviously, but I'll be starting therapy soon, and it would be great to know you're with him when I'm in those sessions. I'd love that. Hey, bud! - Yeah? - She said yes! [Kimberley chuckles] [Jasper] Really? Yeah! [chuckles] Of course she said yes! [Kimberley chuckles] Thanks for coming. [Steven] You must be Gabe. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, who's up for ice cream? I am! [all laugh] [gentle piano music continues] [music crescendo] [closing music playing]
