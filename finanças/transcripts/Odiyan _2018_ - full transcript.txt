It's my last reson! This is a Sorcerer's story. An epic story ofthe King of the Night Tricking enemies, that is, by disguising as animals, frightening them were these Sorcerers. People who traditionally took contracts to frighten people Dark disguises, loneliness, darkness and immaculate timing were these Sorcerers' props. Those nights, when no electricity and silence existed, on the scary, lonely ridges amidst the fields they waited covered under dark cloaks, for their enemies. Thenjump out and land on four legs in front of them. The prey under the spell of a sudden attack of bull or buffalo would fall scared. There were many folklores like, Obtaining Oil from the killed human fetus and applying on their ear lobes, gave them powers to assume forms or shapes that they desired to be. There was a time when the entire village used to be scared of these Sorcerers.. Those ages have now gone by. With the arrival of electricity and disappearance of quietness, the Sorcerers, announced self retirement and left the stage. Many oftheirfuture generations looked at the antics oftheir forefathers with shame. Many among them left these lands Howevertill this movie ends, in a village called Thenkurissi, this story is about one man who would be donning the role of a Sorcerer. One quiet night, stealthily this Odiyan(Sorcerer) had left Thenkurissi. After 15 years, having wandered, meandered and drifted through various lands, to this well familiar and cryptic dark Thenkurisi, he has just returned last night This is his story The story of the last and smart Sorcerer on this earth. Notice" The stage is set, Friends Now is the Sorcerer's game.. Dude Rajesh, why are you sitting like this? Dude Rajesh, why are you sitting like this? Today is your day, man. You need to buy us a drink. The great Odiyan is going to be defeated by you. We need to trap him. A swam a Yourfriend will have a bad time for sure. That bad time will take him along. E Elfifilmififimfifimfi E You haven't grown enough to write Manikyan's horoscope. You don't need to laugh that much. Also, don't underestimate the guy who has just left. Hey Damodaretta, are you also scared? Has Manikyan tricked you too, for you to get scared like this? Hey Mano], if you want to hearthe stories of Manikyan's tricks, go home right now and ask your dad. But Vasu still poops when he talks about it. Anyway, it's good that you were born before that. Damodara just find out about that Odi Mind yourjob man! Damodara, You tell me, what did Manikyan do to Vasu uncle? Rajesh, you leave him and come here, dude. I always felt that shouldn't have been done. What's the use of regretting later? Along with some comrades from Kinasseri, lwas sitting nearthat old iron bridge. I was then very excited about changing the whole world. It was then, that he came that way drinking, dancing and singing. This is the Odiyan I had told you about. The curse of Thenkurissi, The poison, who exploits the superstitions of the village. Consider it as rush of blood of youth. Also, the severe influence of communism on me Palakkad Party were hoisting the flag Stop there! Dog...! Vasu Boss, what's the matter? Do you want to make me a communist too? Of course, I shall. I will be a communist whenever I drink. Then, I too can stop the people walking by And callthem dog orwhateverl like. Boss! Move away from my way. I have things to do after getting home quickly. What have you got to do reaching home so fast? To change costumes for doing tricks? No Boss. After reaching home, I have to empty this. Boss, you move away from my way. What ifl don't move? If you don't move? I will go that way. Hey, stop this buffoonery of yours. Em Thnamfixrmwflssfi Boss, this is not buffoonery. This is an an, something down the generations, my forefathers have been doing. Don't get on me unnecessarily. It is food time.. Sit here chatting about communism I am leaving. Hey! Hey Comrade, don't do anything. So, you aren't going to stop this work, aren't you? Vasu brother, don't mess with him â€œLeave, leave. I don't know why you kicked me. Whatever it maybe for Vasu Boss, for having kicked Manickam ifl do not return it, It's a shame forthese guys who witnessed it. Isn't that the communism in it? You people tell me, so... S0? Nothing because ofthat. No see off at night, especially for us, Odiyans. Saying thatl had provoked him needlessly The Comrades scolded me a lot After they had left, I sat there alone for a long time. Then I got up and walked home. Remained standing till dawn. Then he taken away the horn. Before that, he told me, Boss, it's of no use, How much ever you scream, no voice is coming out. From now on, you will never stick your neck up against anyone. Didn't I tell you then itself, not to challenge me. Saying that, he left. M my Was all that really needed? At the age of learning, got to study not walk around causing trouble in the company ofthese jobless drunkards. Hey lad, What's it, Mom? Who do you think is that black magician? That day, I was the one who had seen my brother's condition. Don't peck at food, finish it. Now in which language do I make you understand? Iam fed up advising. Are you also trying to learn from your uncle? Yourdad only has to do the talking from Saudi. Iam the one to worry seeing all his son's doings. Why do you keep doing these kinds ofthings and have me worried? Today is Prakashettan's Death anniversary. Go to the riverside with uncle. Prabha would have reached there. Prabha? This week when your dad calls, I will tell him everything. That you are on the same path as your uncle. Still, brother, his curse has fallen on my son. That's a good thing. The curse is on him, dear sister. I won't let him go without getting everything settled. I have already told the S l, Not to open Ravi's case without my permission. If you have finished eating, come with me. Uncle, Did Prabha Aunty's and Meenu Aunty's husbands die because of Odi? Are you here to attend the rituals or to dig out the dead people's history? His... I am feeling scared. Uncle, do people die of black magic? Really, are you my nephew? Men should have courage. Those who don't have that... Madam! Madam! Madam, please close your eyes. What for? Close your eyes. Is it to fire at me? Close your eyes. Ok. Hey, why did you touch her hands? Boss, what are you doing? His damn flowers! You won't listen to me even after being warned so many times, won't you? Hey! Manikyan, please don't do anything. Leave him, Manikyan. Leave. 0m..0m.. my Muthappa Hey Odiya (Black Magician)! Now you became the real black man. Hey! You should never trouble Madam! She is my fiancâ€œJÂ©e. What will you do, Odiya? On seeing a goat, you ran like that. What will it be when you see a real black cobra? Prabha! How many years is it since Prakashan died? He didn't die, he was killed. Should I start counting the years now? I shall tell you precisely, But this ain't the right place for that. What happened to her? Why is she talking aboutthe killing, now? May be because she saw Manikyan. Uncle, what are you talking about? I don't understand anything. I didn't say anything to you. Keep quiet and walk. While I was making the offerings to uncle I remembered Dad. Aunty isn't it after seeing Uncle for a long time you became like this? Even your Mom hasn't seen your Dad, me or anyone else. Not even you. My dearest naughty poet. When I call her like that, she would correct me, To call heras "naughty blind poet". As our Mom passed away long back, I was her Mom. Just like I am your Mom now. She sawthe flowers and rivers from what I told her. Notjust me, Manikyan too, Explained her, sang to her, Hey Meenakshi, dear, are you watching the fish? It's not me who's watching the fish, They are watching me. Perfect name for a blind girl who don't knowwhat a fish is orwhat eyes are, Meenakshi (one who has fish shaped eyes)! "Give...eyes..." "Give...eyes..." "Give...eyes..." "Sky is reddish, it is dawning" "Eyes are eagerto see" "Spreading feathers, the cocks crowâ€œ While eager to see "Give...eyes..." "Give...eyes..." "Red like my ornament bindi" "Sun God came and stood high up, faraway" "like the wedding chain, ardently prayed for" "ls the golden moon on the bosom of midnight" "ls a dream hides in my hean" "Why does it spread darkness" "Sky is reddish, it is dawning" "Eyes are eagerto see you" "Spreading feathers, the cocks crowâ€œ "l am eager to see you before me" "The calf came running and knocks against me" "The bell-metal mugs clatter" "Sunlight spills like milk on the courtyard" "The breeze came out ofthe door and leans on it" "The eyelashes stare" "Why do they spread blackness" "Sky is reddish, it is dawning" "Eyes are eagerto see you" "Spreading feathers, the cocks crowâ€œ "l am eager to see you before me" "Give...eyes..." "Give...eyes..." Howmuch ever one is happy any song will come to an end soon. Still, why did Manikyan do that to my Dad and Prakshan uncle? For one person to die, it's not always necessary that one has to kill him. And it may not bethe person whom we suspect. As the people of Thenkurissi say, Then, who killed Dad and Prakashan uncle with horns and hooves, ls it true that master's son was killed by that Odiyan? Everyone says that, but master still doesn't believe it. Unnikrishnan, is it needed? Let's go and ask master, you come quickly. Still, in my opinion you shouldn'thave got into the story of Thenkurussi. Your uncle Ravunni went in for a fight once, And do you know what happened? He was bedridden for 6 months. Even to challenge someone, you need some courage. Youngsters of today don't even have that. What do you think that old Manikyan would do to me? On some occasions, fate is on our side Sometimes, with a smirk it will be on the other side That's whatl am scared about. 0k, let me ask you, Kuttan, what do you know about Manikyan? What's there to know more? He used to be a famous black magician in Thenkurissi. He had scared many people for a long time. When his tricks stopped working he got scared and fled this land Now when he is nearing death, he is back. Kuttan, is it that short, The story of Odiyan, who once frighten and terrorised not just this Palakkad but also Pollachi and Udumalpet No, not at all. When we make the story short, it is we who grow short. Nowl am sure, Eventhough you challenged him, You know nothing about Manikyan. Odiyan (Sorcerer), The whole of Thenkurissi, for that matter, the whole of Palakkad itself, was once under the control of these sorcerers. During childhood, whenl would go outside for urinating, My grandma using to say loudly, "dear, don't go out in the dark, We don't know where the sorcerer might be hiding." Then, two things would come to my mind, A person standing in the shadows of darkness. What all stories I have heard? When I thought a lot about it, I understood that the stories were not real. There is just one truth, No, two. The dark picture of Odiyan and the real darkness, Everything else is the imagination ofthe minds, child The real magic. To make it credible, a Odiyan. To have it credible, our minds. I am sure, Manikyan Sr. would have taught all this to Manikyan Jr. Senior Manikyan? Yes, Senior Manikyan. The grandfather of this Manikyan whom you see now. Manikyan's son didn't like dad's job. He was afraid to do it. He fled this land. He took his wife, Neeli also with him. But he left his son here. Not because he wanted to, But the senior Manikyan begged him, "Mani, please leave at least your son here". For what? To make him a Odiyan (Black Magician) Grandpa, I am scared, please take away the horn. Please take away the horn, grandpa. Silly lad, you come here. Come here. Em a First, you should get rid ofthis fear. You should be the fear, for all of this land. You should be the fear, for all of this land. You should be feared. Open your eyes, dear. "Grandpa's child, wake up, wake up" "Holding my hands, go up, go up" "Like the fire in the heart..." "Like the fire in the heart..." "with the Palmyra palm breeze, you spread" "Keeping up the truth" "Grandpa's child, wake up, wake up" "Holding my hands, go up, go up" "Want a pregnant lady with her first child" "We want in her a child unseen in the world" "On new moon night..." "On new moon night... to rule over us, dear, grow up" "Keeping up the truth" "Grandpa's child, wake up, wake up" "Holding my hands, go up, go up" "You must stand like a strong tusker" "You must bow before Goddess kali" "Greater than your grandfather..." Greater than your grandfather... "You must do sorcery. Like a pearl, you grow up" "Keeping the truth" "Grandpa's child, wake up, wake up" "Holding my hands, go up, go up" The Protector! - Oh Grand pa-Yes, Here you go, This is top class stuff, Hey, why's the drink coloured? Did you bring the muddy water from the river, naughty guy? It's not arrack, it's Brandy. That's the colour of brandy. If you drink it, you will be stoned. Oh Brandy, where did you get it from? A rich man from Pollachi gave it to me, For doing odi tricks. The one who was tricked, was a relative of his Well, before dying I got a chance to drink this from my child Now, I am not worried of dying. Enough drinking it. Let me also try a bit ofthis brandy. Now you ask me, howl tricked that man. Dear, give it to me. Enough. I tricked him by turning into a buffalo. Just seeing me, he got frightened and he started screaming. When I turned back thinking my work was over, Then? When I turned back... Grandpa, imagine your child taking all the blows from those people on his back Grandpa, close your eyes and see all that in your mind, Give My dear grandson has become as good as this grandfather. Still, you need to improve. You have to go a long way to be like me. Jealousy, Even when you are on your last leg, there is no respite forjealousy. What Sorcerer are you? I am the great Sorcerer You are just a baby Sorcerer. You irreverent lad, isn't it I who made you a Odiyan? Didn'tl become like this after learning everything? Isn't that why people from Pollachi and Udumalpet come looking for me. What all things do you know? Just to be a buffalo, cow, sometimes a stray dog, that's all. This ManikyanSr has donned the role of a Odiyan for 50 years. Rhinoceros, bison, and... Rhinoceros, you don't even know what it looks like. You..0diyan, What all costumes can you put on? Anything- Anything that can walk, fly or crawl, That's this Manikyan. Age does not matter you should have good knowledge too, You irreverentl! Can you put on this costume too? Let me get rid of this hangover, I will showyou then, Grandpa Even in death Grandfather's lips stood smiling with pride and joy is only what Manikyan observed. At the same time he is realizing that he is now on his own. Having completed that loneliness, fifteen days to date on a full moon night his childhood friend also left him in lurch That night Prabha was getting married. Any Sorcerer's nightmare -a full moon night. On this Full Moon night, like Manikyan, there was one more lonely person in Thenkurissi then, spending sleepless nights, and waiting for Prabha. Someone who used the indifference towards him, One with the colour of darkness. I came rushing this morning, to tell you about this. Well, tonight we are getting together here. Just you and me. Yourfirstwedding party is from me. So what, you will be coming for the wedding of Bhama's daughter, Don't bring your military drinks, lwill bring a bottle of drink from Ceylon. Are you leaving? So early? I had asked to stay till evening. Don't be late. Let's start now. Will it be a trouble forthe groom if you go to sleep a little late today? Hey, no..l would be happy forthat. I was also planning fora party with you, Ravunniyettan. Ravunniyetta, I neverthought that I could have a drink sitting here, at the ponico ofthis great Kelakkam house. That too on the very night of my wedding. It's all my luck. The fortune you got is much bigger than that, dude. What's that, brother? You are really a fool. Who selected you into the Army I wonder, Prakash I guess I have lost consciousness. Please say clearly brother. Not just your fortune, it's everyone's fortune, The great fortune. So fair, plumb and fatty fortune. The real fortune. Nowl got it. Once though aimlessly I did often walk around this house Wishing to catch one glimpse of her Then what happened? What happened? That wish is nowwaiting upstairs Without sleeping for me But that wish was not only yours alone Whose else was it? Not a person who you don't know. And you don't have to look across the wall Always together, Fortunately, only sleep was not together. Hey Prakashan, shucks. See, that is all the trust girls give us It can bust any time. Especially, with fools like you. I would like to believe that he has not touched her. Might not have, touched... who? That Odiyan, the black magician. He wants both ofthe girls, What about the other guys? Gotto kill, kill him. LWill kill him. Before I go back, I will kill him. I swear on my father. Prakashettan, you are talking about killing whom? The Pakistani people? Enough with your drinks. You are already drunk. Com e. Prabha sister! Who is that? Who? Prabha sister! Who is that? Meenootty! - Prabha sister - What happened? Someone's there in this room. No, nobody's here. Don't be frightened, Sister, someone's here. Yes, there is. No, nobody's here. I am here, don't be frightened now. What's up there? What? What's it Prabha? What was that sound? Prakashettan, you go and sleep. Today, I will sleep in Meenutty's room. I was really scared. Sister, you knowthat I am not scared of darkness. I felt like someone sitting near me. No, it was not a feeling, someone was here. It's ok, don't think about that. You say the prayers and sleep. (Saying prayer) Get out ofthe house right now! Your privilege ends at the front yard ofthe house. None should have such a dirty mind. Black is notjust your skin colour, It's the colour of your mind. Get out! I am not telling Prakashettan aboutthis nasty incident due to my dignity. No, you don't have to tell him. I will tell him myself, about his wife and sister having such a companion at night. Even after he returns to the Army that would be of help of him. Manikyan! You will never be better, you and your words, never. From now on, you should never enterthis house. If you enter, I have got the right treatment for you. If you get that treatment, your legs will never rise to climb these stairs Even on the night after Princess's wedding, Didn't realize that the Sorcerer's protection existed - You ...-Manikyan! Madam, my hands are still cramping to hit him. You dark chap, get lost. When I heard about the drinking party inthe morning, itselfl felt that I should've been here. Madam, you go to sleep. I will be here only. Why are you looking like this? Are you seeing bulls and buffalos for the first time? I was just checking that Odiyan Manikyan is among them. Aunty, have you seen Odiyan transforming into bull and buffaloes? I haven't seen. But Manikyan has done Odi tricks for me. He turned into a bull. Meenootty, stop crying. Why are you crying? I will find a way. Don't cry. Don't be scared. Manikyan! What's it, Madam? Got to do Odi on a guy, can you? I have no otherway. Forget about me, he's not sparing even Meenootty. Whenever he comes here, he troubles us with his diny stares and language. She is not even an adult. It's truly pathetic. Manikyan, you know, I have brought up my dear blind girl, without letting anyone trouble her. The Sorcerer of the village, please be kind to me. Just scare him would do, So forthe Odi trick what should I pay? Madam, go inside and bring a betel leaf and arecanut with a coin. You don't have to give me anything else for tricking Ravunni nair. This one, is on me...free I will not just scare him, a little more, Manikyan, why you don't want any money? An account book since my school days, is still there with me. Let me settle down those accounts. As you said, I will do the tricks for Kariman Nair for Meenootty. I had already committed another work, but it's ok. Well, bring the betel leaf, arecanut and coin. Hey Manikyan, I know you are among these. If you are a man, step in front of me as a human. To trick you, why would I need the magic costumes? Unni, drink this. Au nty ! Come here. What did Dr Menonfrom Palakkad say? That he will need to lie down like this for a year? Only six months is needed. Yes, that's why. Everyone say that the Senior Manikyan is better. If he had done the trick, one couldn't get out ofthe bed for a year. This Manikyan is not good enough. Afteryou left this place, I was not interested in anything. Something was missing. Whenl come here to drink, after closing the tea shop, I would serve a glass for you too, like this. I drank looking at that glass, forthe past 15 years. Whenever I see that Kariman Nair's pride and show off, I would wish you had been here. He is not the same person, as when you had left this place. He has become a big business man. Theatre, bus, petrol pump, and the pride combined with all these. Then and now, there's only one thing he doesn't have, Courage. You drink it. You had met Prabha, didn't you? Yes. I guess it was Prakashan's death anniversary. Years are passing very fast. Manikyan, you are already drunk. I am fine. - Shall we go? - You carry on. It's been a long time sincel had a night walk through Thenkurissi. 0k then, I am leaving. You walk through Thenkurissi. Don't know why, Even ifl drink a lot, not getting tipsy as I used to For that, I will have to take two more pegs once back home. Ravunni brother, I need to sit in the train for 3-4 days. Thinking about leaving you all is... Not us, leaving her. That's right, you're still newly wedded couple. That's the matter. I have to make it grand today, Prakashan, Ravunni, Let me step inside and say Prakashan, Shucks...Ravunni brother... Look there, that scabbed dog, Prakashan, we need to handle him too. Do you want anything to eat? Here is yourtea. What dares you to leave the day after tomorrow? Working outside during day and inside at night. Finish his work today itself. As you have already seen this sorcerer, I knowyou won't step back even ifl hold you back. That's your personal matter. Your own reason. Punch him as much as you want to, Go and punch him. Ravunni brother, need not, Don't trouble Prakashan forthis silly matter. We will take care ofthis black magician. Come on guys. Hey! What's that? Don't do that. Stop everything by today, Your tricks won't work anymore in this Thenkurissi. Ifl kill a sorcerer like you and return, The army will award me with medals. What's this? I told you not to. Prakashan, why are you hitting him likethis? Did you trouble any of your acquaintance? Or did he steal yourthings? Damodara, he might have stolen something of Prakashan. You don't need to knowthat. Leave him. Let him finish his anger himself. Did you see this callus? It's not from getting punched, But from punching others. Sir, you go home. Ifl hityou back in front of all these people, The shame is for Madam. Hey, who are you to take care of the madam of Kelakkam family? Your night guard is no longer required there. Go. Dude Prakashan, your arms handle guns. Those stuff must not put your hands at rest You will go back only afterfinishing him off. Hey! Sir, your hands should be always yours, Don't lend them to anyone else. But you will have to pay for hitting me now. Nobody needs to teach this Odiyan that job. Not very late, the new moon falls before yourtrip on Friday. Don't forget that. Gorgeous! Just three days for me to return Not to go are my thoughts Sure. On the 4th day they will take you away Don't forget that you are in the Army Don't come to see me off at the station If you come...it will not be nice Go to School. Don't waste your leaves lfl come, others will get to see the crying of an army man! Isn't that why you didn't want me to come? What is this Odiyan got to do here all the day? Despite telling several times not to let him step here All you want is him to work here? No dear, Manikyan's folks have been working here for generations! How does it matter to us if he is an Odiyan(Black Magician)? He has not caused any troubles And in future too, he would not. I trust Manikyan a lot When talking about your childhood friend, Why is the Sweetness in your voice? Did Kelakam family get this Odiyan alone to take their girl to school, play and bathe in the pond? These are not my words But yourwords The first night itself the sour stuffl heard I have heard from others too many things! Heard what? No..Nothing that serious.. Speak out Some silly gossips! I left itthen itself Need not leavethem ifthere is anything you heard tell me right away For further clarity, we can find out from Manikyan downstairs Come on, leave it Prabha..l just spoke... Come on I'm leaving for School Shall return by noon okay Come Show us an Odi trick before you leave Will Elephant be fine? Eikapmmmn Em To showyourtricks comfortably I had told them not to hit where it hurts ls it not? Yes Come Odi trick can't be shown anywhere Why? Total darkness is needed for that No one else should be present and shouldn't thrash like this So, Elder, on the next full moon midnight visit Thenkurussi alone to the large paddy fields! For my Police elder, a special Odi trick from me Can't even joke with these Odi tricksters! Hey My Lathi! Catch Here comes the S.l Manikyan..Thanks very much Mr. Advocate Manikyan...Did Police thrash you? The Postmortem report says, cause for Prakashan's death is cardiac arrest Then why the heck did they thrash you? Because of the certainty that I won't retaliate! Odiyan can be thrashed only during day time, isn't it? Manikyan, you got to be careful For Prakash's death, Thenkurussi folks have only one to name.. Madam too? You guys leave, I got to meet someone. Was this your Word of Protection? When I heard, you had publically challenged Prakash lthought it was only to scare him. But. But I really didn't know it was to make me a widow! To have us orphans be alone again.. What sin did we commit? Ifthe Police, Doctor or even ifthe entire Thenkurussi arrays together and claims, I won't believe, that Prakash died of hean attack. Remember one thing, Manikyan! When you kill a person with your Odi trick, it is notjust one person who dies. It's not me. Get inside It's not me Do you think I could do that? When an innocent man is deemed a killer it's that man who dies! Not me.. It's not me. "Ox-hoof on your chest" "Black thorn on your eyes" "Sorcerer..." "Wearing masks always" "can't believe the real face nowâ€œ "Sorcerer..." "Suffering greatly...Sorcerer..." "Why do you live in this world?"

I heard you had returned But did not expectyou would come to meet me Witnessing an unexpected visit feels good I was about to leave Remaining days after hiding Can't help appreciating the disguise Anyways I am not used to Gosai language Shall I ask something? What is Odiyan(Black Magician)called in Hindi? Can't you at least smile? Earlier there were only smiles on your face all the time You have taken longertime to return than the the distance you travelled, isn't it? Good minus Atleast to me.. How long has it been since you left? 15 Years It has been that long since Ravi too left! See you later Ravi wanted me to visit your home and convey this Butl didn't want herto know Sol decided to convey it over here What is it that she should not have heard? Sure.. Ravi is a Teacher in this School Still he is reluctant to convey this to you ls so much of formality needed between us? We want Meenukutty Would you mind giving her hand to Ravi? Hen.. ...0utside.. Little chick. Sir.. Is it sympathy is what you were about to askl know.. No.. Never.. Because Ravi loves Meenukutty very immensely When he was talking to me about this, I saw that immense love in his eyes! If he gets her, We will consider it as his fortune! I also had something else to say When Ravi had such a desire, he first disclosed it to Manikyan Now also he is standing outside the School Anxiously waiting foryour reply As he doesn't have the strength to face you, Poorfellow! See you Sir The Little Chicken ate grains Thara stood staring. The Little Chicken ate grains The Eagle sawthat And the crow also saw Ask your dad to fix the auspicious date No need of Ezhuttachan! Seek some other good astrologer! PANCHAYAT OFFICE Please begin, Prabha teacher Greetings Please be seated Thenkurussi needs light We need Electricity at any cost Street lights have reached the neighbouring villages It should also reach here at the earliest Let no one in Thenkurussi must walk in Darkness any more No one must die in our houses and fields at night Let no one kill anyone in darkness Sister, we all are with you in getting electricity here Don't get excited, Ravi lfthe Electricity comes in, Your 0diyan's business will only end! You are also learning Odi from him, aren't you? Don't be so inauthentic! Although Prabha is rig ht, aren't there too many hurdles in bringing in Electricity? Like Initial Deposit Wood for the Posts, and Space for Line connection Can we afford all this? Could be impossible foryou But possible for me! All at my own cost Just say when you require I've the enough wood in my fields for as many posts you require And Land..Anywhere... I can immediately transfer it to Panchayat! What do you say? Pull it well and tie Dol need to bring in skilled labourers from Perambavoorto complete thejob? Yes..Pull that nicely Thenkurussi will get Electricity and light very soon Look, Posts are erected..lines have been drawn.. Is to trap me these lines are being drawn? I don't belong to this Village But ever since I stepped in, lam hearing about Odiyan and Odi tricks! I'm also certain about one thing like everyone here.. That Odiyan and Odi trick can't be confined inthe brightness of4 bulbs What do you say? Yeah..Carry on..Carry on.. Oh! You? Long time no see! After becoming Kelakam's son-in-lawthe path to this place has been forgotten, is it? Not at all. I can understand Madam forgetting the old paths After so long, I've not forgotten... ...any person or any path I was little busy, Manikyan Oh! Busy in bringing electricity to light up Thenkurussi!

Then let us.. - Wasn't it Splendid! - Absolutely! Drink tea all of you Thus the Light has come in! Slowly. At dusk, where are you taking this blind? It's bad times! Here some may get other ideas on seeing a pregnant woman Hope you understand what I am saying! Should we ourselves provide Odiyan the scent of a fully grown fetus? If he sniffs, then both mother and baby will slip from your hands Therefore try reaching home before dark Please don't feel offended ifl say something You have the place of an Elder brother Still you shouldn't have spoken this way in front of her I thought you have little sense Nowl understood you hardly have any! Let's move, dear To take away happiness, People will turn up from somewhere!! Take your darling wife carefully and hand her over safely in the hands of Odiyan Atleast she will know that he can't do anything No Odiyan has cut open the Stomach and taken out the fetus one has created! You are all what Odiyan needs, Ravi! You be careful So that you also don't turn up dead like Prakash! No Ravietta! Don't ask fortrouble He is not a human being. He is an evil! This nephew of mine in Kelakam family had two desires First to marry Prabha Cechi, and then keep me as his concubine His damn advise! Don't look back..Keep walking Suffer Reach her home safely Don't let the fetus slip off on the road! Leave me Don't. If anyonetalks rubbish, no one must considerwho it is! I too will not. From nowl shall also address you by name! So Ravunni Nair, Manikyan's suspicion is right Prakashaettan was killed Now I'm sure who would've done that! Stan counting backwards You are reaching ZERO As you call, a Black Round Zero! Nobody is around Narayani must have got fed up waiting! (Singing) (Reciting hymns) O Lord..O Goddess..l will be back now. No way..l will not talk to him Look Ezhuttachan there What are you up to, Ezhuttachan? Waiting in queue to buy a movie ticket! Don't you guys have any other business to do? Get away Won't let me Pee also. Useless fellows! Hail Lord! Didn't I Walk? Oh no! Hail Lord! O my God! 0mg! Hail Goddess! Am I still not walked?

Oh no...Odiyan..Odiyan.. Only forthis reasonl brought electricity to Thenkurussi Ezhuthacha, it was I who provoked him to do an Odi on you! But slightly missed! Next time it won't miss Were you deliberately putting me as bait? Boys..Search him But still, Ravunnietta... See..no use of bringing in Electricity He keeps doing 0di!! See what happened? We became Morons! He has broken it forthe 3rd time! He will break the entire bulbs in Thenkurussi We shouldn't leave this Do we need to talk to Odiyan or lodge a police complaint? Go and lodge! Police can hardly do anything to him! Why Police? Aren't we alone enough? We shall ask him What do you say, Ezhuttachhan? Who dares to talk to him? Yes..coming We will escalate it to Damodharan, let him speak to him Aren't they friends? What an irony! Nothing will happen You go and speak to him - I will try - What? I can only try Don't be scared, dear In this thunderstorm, are you waiting forthe rain? Doesn't this little one sleep? Ravi will be late, Meenutty Why spoil the sleep ofthe baby too? Go to bed Let me wait for some more time Do as you wish I got to check some papers Ravi dear Has Ravi returned? Ravi dear Ravi dear Ravi dear Meenukutty, what was that noise there? Oh no! Ravi! Oh my god! Who the hell did this!! Oh no! Meenutty..0ur Ravi.. Evenl suspect the same! It's the Odi! It is said he was not present during the incident He was in UdumalpeL. it is all lies! As witnesses two Tamilians were also produced at the Police station That is what we call.. 0diyan's illusion He can be present there and here too! Can do the Odi there and here also! While he would be drinking butter milk there, he will be drinking arrack here this time, even if he can get away from Police and us under any pretext Isn't there One above watching all this? Still..on behalf of a person eating raw flesh, creating potions out of unborn fetus and killing people Our Gopi Sir defending so long... unimaginable...! How much of advising... Fate! Afate, father and son pleaded for and got from that Odiyan...! Experience it then How often had I advised the dad and the son?! They didn't pay heed Now why CW? Burn him The Odiyan... right now His ashes too must not remain by dawn Hmm Yeah..Wait..Surround the house Hmm..Burn it down Burn it down to ashes Come on everyone What is this Meenutty? How can starving help? Shouldn't you think ofthe baby too? The Kelakom home thus very soon turned into that ofjust two widows. Since the day Ravi passed away, Meenu moved into her room, never stepped out. Neither she spoke to anyone.. Shackled in loneliness in self-exile she locked herself No... One day... Just one day... She stepped out. On the 14th day of Ravi's death. Meenutty, where are you going? I want to meet Manikyan.. ...Right now Would you take me? Why do you want to meet him now? Even if you refuse, I will go by myself. Meen utty, careful.. Just for once To hear that I walked all this distance ...l only want to hear that For your Odi trick, Did you need my fetus, Manikyan? "N0" is what I wish to hear Say.. Say N0 Don't touch her After bringing darkness in this blind woman's hean also, Aren't you quite satisfied? On killing Prakash in the fields and Ravi in front of her, What did you gain? Darkness...You are only Darkness! Adiny pitch darkness that puts your loved ones into Darkness! I have frightened" And have blacked out.. But haven't killed anyone so far! It's not me then, now and ever.. only thing I got to say It's not me It is not me Notme That's all, my grandpa Awasted life of the last Odiyan in Thenkurussi I have not killed anyone, grandpa You know the truth well, grand pa One day Thenkurussi will knowthat But why did you... I carry the curse of many generations May be to stay away from it, my dad fled Thenkurussi then! I am also leaving, grandpa Surrendering all my Odi tricks here! Any outside work for me to do? If I starve witho ut work, then it's a disgrace to this family Plenty of chores for sure Kept pending all these many years! Look at the state of the farm Didn't you walk away quietly one day! By the way.. Were Odi tricks yourjob wherever you travelled? Where were you these many years? Never permanent anywhere Wandered a lot.. Prayed at many temples Bathed in several rivers Begged for alms And what did you gain? Nothing Returned the way I had left Like the one night I left Praying that no one sees me into the same darkness! The turmoil in my heart still remains! All that pounding in my chest that kept me from sleeping all these while Those hooves.. they still persist a m Howeverl had enough, Madam I only found answerto the blood I did not shed The curse of many at the end of my Odi tricks, ...The darkness of many nights" None ofthem have left me. You didn't tell anything about yourself! What dol say, Manikyan! I cried a lot A lot turned grey Kept watching the boy growing What else? Kept listening to a man proposing every month And I abused and chased him away Then.. Then when a Deer hopped by the house once, The young girl of yore eagerly waited for its return! All the doubts within me, (flflaflpu Now.. Only FEAR prevails FEAR FOR LIFE I know Thangamani Varisiar told me everything Varisiar?! But she had left Thenkurussi Where did you meet her? Varanasi You would've seen me several times But we've not spoken so far Thenkurussi folks did not address me as Thangamani Varisiar, but as Varisiar of Ravunni! Earlierl used to be thrilled by that address It was much later that I realized I'm not Ravunni's Varisiar! The only name that was always present for him, was that of Prabha! Also while lying drunk beside me, He used to call me that! And I shared the bed with him for many years like another woman! All that... ...l tolerated! You are shivering a lot If don't mind.. Why do I mind, Manikyan? Ravunniar do visits my home Seeing him walk with Wide chest and head up I used to be very much joyous A kind of hope.. He visited my home daily Except for 2 days Why? It was to kill two persons It was he who said that he killed them Whenl had asked him to stop sniffing behind Prabha and marry me, You!! I've satiated myself with two murders One with Hooves pounding on him and the other by stabbing with horns If God bestows on me with Marriage.. Then it will happen only with her ...Prabha! Shouldn't she also be interested? Has she ever noticed you? You! I have only one doubt now Who is going to be killed by my hands first? You... or her? I fled away fearing him only I will never return, Manikyan In this Kashi, in some hermitage, before I breathed my last, me meeting you and disclosing the truth, is all for sure God's will Before leaving Thenkurussi I met Prabha and told her everything She is in real fear And poor Meenkutty, she stays confined behind closed doors foryears For enduring and withstanding everything, Prabha has only one reason I know what that is Therefore you should return, Manikyan If you delay, No one will remain in the Kelakkam family Then couldn't rest there Atleast hereafter don't bow before him Don't stay quiet lam there beside you to defend As long as you need me by the side ofthis Kelakkam house! Shall I serve some gruel, Manikyan? Hmm..Yes Sit inside Hmm When she came to meet you last Since then she hasn't stepped out of her room For these long years... Didn't even botherto visit a hospital for delivery.. Even Monu's growth, she didn't watch When everyone kept saying you killed Prakashettan and Ravi, including me. She...0nly she.. Said that Manikyan will never do such a thing Though people with sight lied, My child alone sawthe truth! O my God! Mummy Mummy Mummy Mummy My dear son Au nty Madam Here I heard you are making money Cheating locals! Not cheating, I make strong Odi A person is still in the hospital ...One Kounder.. At Pollachi Hospital Look at the pride terrorizing and sending a person to hospital! What all disguises do you take? Come on...Leave that, Madam How can I? I have a desire to see you in a disguise! Oh my grandpa..once when I fulfilled a wish, a person died! Iam yet to get a response What is your desire! Deer A Buck! WWW you? Deer? I don't know to take such forms I have few errands to do Eksfiim QflhmmnÃ©ilulfl H651 mafimwmm is m When the next no moon comes, I will show you No, I want to see it right today Today? Hmm Okay, done Tonight? No..Not tonight! Tomorrow night After Pollachi bus leaves, Keep watching at that pan "l will bring, I will bring" "l will bring a pine-leaf mat" "l will take you, I will take you" "To "Anthyalan" grove" "To see the "Pullaani" forest" "And to pick white lilies" "l'll take you to the hill where deers run, girl" "l will bring, I will bring" "l will bring a pine-leaf mat" "The Sorcerer night breeze..." "A swing on the palm tree..."

Still I asked, like all girls.. "Do you love me" "What kind of a love is that" Madam, Night was the breath of my life Night, when everyone sleeps I wanderthrough Thenkurussi at night..l loved Not as Odiyan. Like everyone, on two legs Isn't it becausel had no one like others to put me to sleep or wake me I often think so as I wander alone While wandering like that, upstairs in the eastern corner of one Tharavad I happen to see a single lamp glowing I have always considered it as another sleepless person like me Two lonely persons in the night Definitely will awaken a liking When all are asleep, a liking for someone who isn't, is all I felt.. And that is all one must Being around to be heard and seen is happiness A lie A lie a man uses on his lover when he is sure that his love is not going to succeed. One blatant lie! That's is all to it! I'm fed up hearing this every month! Can't you at least realize both of us have greyed and grown old? It's my final warning I can't stand this any more lfl get to hear it again I will forgetyou as my Uncle or some Thenkurussi Chieftain! I will be forced to take the broom! Get out Don't keep sitting turning your face darker! It's the arrogance of his return! An audacity that you never had before... Listen" Are you planning to marry Odiyan, eat raw flesh And slanderthe family reputation? If so? If so, how does it affect you? Isn't it enough for me to convince my dead husband? In fact he didn't die But was killed! The two ofthem! - That.. - Out Othen/vise" You will be forced to hearthe 0diyan's Slang from my mouth! You! For all your responses... and the humiliations by you, I will pay back to him and then all that kept aside for you Keep waiting Knaflafixfixam] May be she was also not sure of your return But I knew you will come To smear my hooves with blood By the time you leave, some more bodies will fall in these fields This Ravuni is certain about that too No, Ravunni Nair Don't raise the count of dead bodies any more 0ne.. Just one Dead body to lie flat on the fields! That is all I need What you've been telling is true Forthis Manikyan's return after these long years, has got only one reason It's to kill a person After seeing that dead body, I will leave Mark Thenkurussi 0diyan's words! Without waiting to wash that blood and change my dress I would just walk away Until then, I will be here When did you start doing Odi against children, Manikyan? Have you gone that cheap? You well understand why I mentioned your nephew's name As well as I! Don't stand and needlessly provoke an 0diyan..Leave I know It was for her..You returned I was only away from Thenkurussi Not from Madam To understand that, this binh is not sufficient foryou Nair..Leave Wait In case if you feel like killing someone on your way Keep this Which you hid in the warmth and chillness of yourVarisia's side! Dry blood stains are on this! Ofthe ones you clubbed and lanced in my name.. Those two person's blood! To kill you, I don't need this Wooden hoof Take NoWyW 9Â° and rescue your nephew That's whatl am saying Don't send Rajesh alone Before Odiyan catches us, we got to catch Odiyan ls your planning against Odiyan done? What else now, straight tothe fields, isn't it! What the hell do you all think of Manikyan? Even yourtongue should shiver while talking about him Plan that you all don't get killed in the fields Even if you all get together, you can't even touch a fur of his blanket! To think of finishing him, must be an equal.. That is ME What do you think, Aunty? Who will win tomorrow? Would Odiyan lose? Would lose! But that would be Thenkurussi I'm not able to catch sleep, Manikyan Will you be able to do it at this age? We are of same age I know the difficulty in pulling this shutter down Give up, Manikyan Forget it Needn't wait to inform them.. Just walk away silently Some days later, everyone would forget everything Tomorrow on No moon night Thenkurussi must be in complete darkness! You got to ensure that Just understand" Look into my eyes Those Children is what you see!
