- Shh. Oh, shit! God. What the fuck? - Oh. Oh. Oh. God. God. Okay. Fuck it. - Oh, great. How'd you hear about this? - Oh, come on. I'm shocked you have such a little faith in me. You know I have a sense about these things. I was on my way to get trash bags and I saw the lights. So what do you got going on? Fender bender, drunk driver? Elaborate murder-suicide? - Look, as of right now, we're not really sure. We're still putting the pieces together. - Okay. Let's just start with the basics. Any dead? - Yeah. - How many? - One. - Who? - I can't release that yet till I talk to the family. - Was anyone else involved? - Not sure. It doesn't appear so. - All right, well, what did the guy, I mean, I assume it was a guy, hit? - Not sure. - I mean, was it a tree or another car, an animal, was it Batman? - We're done here. - Well then speculate. - I can't. - Why not? - Because I don't have all of the facts yet. - Well, that's never stopped you before. - Get the hell outta here, Max. - Okay, okay, okay. All right. Listen, Charlie, I really need your help here. All right? I need a story, badly. I got bills up to my eyeballs, my hot water got turned off last week, my electricity got turned off this morning, and I've been wearing the same socks for six days. Throw me a bone. - I'm sorry, Max. I just can't. - Come on, man, six days. You owe me. - I don't owe you shit. In fact, you wanna start tallying favors now? - Mm, well probably not a good idea. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, but I'm not kidding, man. I do need your help. - All right. Here's the thing. It looks like we may have an animal attack on our hands. - Okay. That's it? I mean, what kind of animal are we talking about here? Is it a wolf, bear, mountain lion? - Would you just shut up and I'll tell you? You asked for something, I'm giving it to you, but you gotta turn that goddamn thing off. - All right. Sorry. - So given the size of the damage, it could be a bear, but we won't know sure until the medical examiner gets a chance to look at him. - That's kind of odd, isn't it? Bears don't generally generally attack this close to civilization, I mean, let alone on top of the road, do they? - No, they do not. The theory is that the guy may have hit the bear, gotten out to look and the bear wasn't happy. But again, we will not know anything for sure until the M.E. gets a look at him. - Oh, but you don't buy that, do you? No, no, that's why you're being so, so Charlie, about the whole thing. - Come here. Let's just say that, um, there are certain things I don't like about this scene, right? And I'm gonna feel a whole lot better about it once I get that report back on the guy, but until then, that stays with me. Got it? - Yeah, yeah. Think I got everything I need for now. - Good. So get hell outta here. I got work to do. - Hey. - Yeah? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Go. - You're beautiful, Charlie. Yeah. Yep. - Hey beautiful, it's me. How you doing? Oh, I'm great, I'm great. No, I didn't call about that. Honestly, I didn't. Hey, I remember our conversation. Yeah. Well, I'm actually, uh, a little more interested in the other body you got today. I ran into Charlie this morning and he told me. I just wanted get a chance to take a look. I mean, you know Charlie, once he starts talking, he's like a school girl at Christmas. Is there a problem? Hmm. That bad, huh? How big of an animal are we talking about here? Well can you make a guess? No, no. If you can't, you can't. I, I'm just asking. Okay, no, no. Hey, it's no problem. I get it. No, I appreciate the time. All right, thanks. Talk to you. - Great job last week, guys, really, you hit out of the park. Nice work on the cartoons, Bobby. Very good. That group Route 2 incident, you really captured the feel of it. And those photos, outstanding. I felt like I was in the football game at that point. You guys are doing amazing work, by the way. I don't tell you that often enough but you should hear it from me. Now, I need you to do even more amazing work this week. We gotta keep things going. We've gotta keep the vibe... - Hello? - Harry, it's me. Guess what? We're back in business, baby. - I'm just saying, if I'd known, I was gonna be waiting for 20 minutes, I wouldn't have dropped everything. I had to get my electricity turned back on. - Did you call Bill? - How do you think I got my electricity turned back on? - And he gave you an advance? - Of course. - He did? - Yep. - Just like that? - Sort of. - Uh, what do you mean? What do you mean? - There are a few stipulations to the whole thing. Caveats, if you will. We just need to do a few things. - We? - We are a team, aren't we? Together, as always. One for all or all for one kind of thing. - Let's have it. - Oh, it's nothing really. We just need to send Bill the first shots of whatever we find, plus a thousand word treatment on his desk by Tuesday, and then, you know, may need to do a few bad jobs. Nothing. - Man, you are the biggest fucking weasel! Every time you do this to me, I think it's gonna be the last time, and yet here I am again. I need help. - Come, have a seat. I'll make you some nice cocoa, and I'll show you what I've got. - Okay. What is it this time? - Well, let me tell you, at first I thought nothing big, but now I'm not so sure. - What happened? - And Charlie was off. I mean, he was still Charlie, but he just didn't seem right. - Like how? - I don't know, he just seemed a little, a little lost, maybe. - He's probably just putting things together. - Yeah, maybe. No, no. It seemed like more than that. I mean, I haven't seen that look on him since... - Since when? - Since Nancy, I guess. - Oh. I, I'm sorry, Max, but you're not making any sense. - What? Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on, listen. So I came across an accident on Route 2 today, and I thought, "Great, nice little fender bender. Maybe grab a quick post to the paper tomorrow, score some cash." - And Charlie was there? - Yep. Along with two other cruisers. - Oh wow. Big time. Okay, I'm with you so far. So what did he say? - Well that's just, that's just it. Nothing. The most I could get out him was that someone had died after possibly hitting a bear. - And? - Where is this thing? But it was the, here it is, it was the way he said it, you know? I mean, he believed it was a bear about as much as if someone had told him old Mrs. Atler had hobbled down the road and simultaneously taken out the car and driver in a primal fit of rage. - So what do you think? - Oh, no idea. - None? - No. But listen. My spider sense is tingling on this one. - Dammit, Max, your spider sense is always tingling. It's gotten to the point where I think it's just an inner ear infection. I mean, this is pretty thin even for you. - Yeah, but I'm right. I know it. Are you with me? - I, I don't know. I, I don't have time for this right now, I... - Come on. I can't do it without you, champ. I need you. - Whatever. - Yes. So what's the plan? - For now, just a little recon. - You never made me cocoa. You know where you're going? - Yeah. Let's see, the accident happened back there, which is south and you know, judging by the broken branches and markings on the shoulder, it went off in this direction, which is northeast. - West, it's northwest. - Right. - What do you expect to find? - Not entirely sure, but I'll know when I find it. - Of course. I just don't wanna get caught out here when the sun goes down. - Fair enough. Fucking... You know what? That's it. I got nothing. Shit. So much for... - I'm guessing we're about 40 minutes from the car, so we could probably press on for another 15 or so. - No, we've been all over this area. If there was something here, we would've found it by now. Hey, check that out. - What? - There. - Holy shit. How did we miss this? - We're two idiots with just a compass wandering around in the woods. I'm amazed we found it. - What kind of tracks are these? - No idea. - And do you think it could be bear? - Seems kind of small for a bear, doesn't it? The toes don't quite match a bear's either. Definitely less paw-like. What? I, I don't spend all my time with you. I have a life. - Oh. - You know? - Okay. Just give me the flashlight. Start taking pictures. - Fine. - Make sure to get a good close-up of the claw marks. - I will get them. I will get them. Damn backseat photographer. - Less paw-like. - Can you see the bottom? - No. It's deeper than shit, I'll tell you that. Okay. You get everything? - If it's here, I got it. - Good. Let's get back. Suddenly, I don't wanna be here after dark either. - Hello? - Hey, it's me again. Long time no hear. - Hi. I was just thinking about you. - Oh, that's nice to hear. Why, did Pete leave town? - Very funny. No, there seems to be some complications with that body you asked about. - What kind? - It's just so strange. Listen, Max, I really shouldn't be talking about this until I can confirm something. - Okay, dang, we're just talking about it here. You know, it's no big deal. Yeah, so what's the plan? Uh, what's the next step? I just mean, you remember that forensic expert friend I have at Cal State? Well he owes me a favor. - It's nothing like that. Eh, maybe I'm overreacting. - Are you sure I can't call my friend? He could at least provide some added depth. - He wouldn't be any good unless he's a wildlife expert as well. - Oh, unfortunately not. Do you have somebody in Portland? - Boston, but we'll see. Supposedly she's the best. Listen, Max, I really gotta run. You, uh, take care - Wait, just, - of yourself. - just, would you, just let me know if you find anything? - Sure. I'll do what I can. - Excellent. No, I really appreciate it. Thank you. - Sure, Max. Bye. - Well? - I think I got what I needed. - What did she say? - I'll tell you this, whatever happened to that guy in the slab, she doesn't know, and that scares the hell out of her so much so, she swallowed her pride and asked for help from the outside. - Strange. Who? - I don't know. She's a wildlife expert out of Boston. - Well, who would that be? I mean, that's all we have to go on? - For now. - Ah. - You know what? We can find out more. It might be too late now. Tomorrow, I want you to contact this guy. He works for the Wildlife Preservation Society out of Cambridge, I did a story on him a couple years back. Ask him to find out who's advising Dr. Matthews on this. Tell him that Diane said that this woman is the best, so he should know her. Best ones are rarely the obscure ones. Present company excluded. With any luck, he'll know exactly where to go on this. If he gives you any shit about it, just remind him that he owes me a favor. Leave it at that. - Okay, will do. Here are the photos from today. You really think this is connected? - I don't know. I just wanna find out if it's actually a bear because otherwise, why does it feel so shady? You know, I mean, we'll stick on this. We'll get it. - Yeah? I wish I had the confidence you do. - A little faith, my dear, a little faith. That's all. All right. You wanna a beer or something? - Nah, I'm heading out. It's been a long day. - Suit yourself. - Max, there's something you should know. - What'd you say? What, what is it? - Ah, it's nothing. - Oh, come on. What is it? - Just curious who you know at Cal State? - Hmm. Nobody. - That's what I thought. - Dutch! Dutch! Come here, boy! Dutch! Dutch, come on, boy! Dutch! Dutch! Come on! - Hey, Charlie. Chance to get a little closer look? - I can't do that. What the hell are you thinking? - Just tell me if it's the same as the first one. - Close enough for government work, anyway. Goddamn mayor's involved now. He wants us to make sure we keep a tight lid on everything. - Good luck with that in this town. Right? - You ain't shittin'. Poor woman probably never even knew what hit her. One minute she's walking Dutch, the next... - I heard it might be a bear. - Mm. - Migrated down from Canada. - I've never heard of a bear doing anything like this. But what the hell do I know? Listen, Max. You gotta go. If someone sees me talking to you, I'm gonna hear it. - Find Dutch? - No, and I don't expect we will. Now get the hell outta here. - Yeah. I try, thanks. - Max. What is it? I was almost in. - I have an idea. - I don't like this. Sonny looked sick. - Yeah. Come on. - Uh, have a seat. Can I, uh, offer you two some coffee? - Oh, I'd love some, black, thanks. - Miss Stanz? - Oh, Harriet, please. Uh, I'm good. Thanks. - So, um, how long did you live next door to Mrs. Stirgard? - Oh, about eight years now. - Thank you. You two friends? - We were friendly. Hey, she's a nice lady. We were cordial to each other, but just typical neighborly stuff, I suppose. - Yeah. Hey, do you mind if I just record this? - Uh, no. - Okay. Great. Great coffee, by the way. - Thanks. - Well, I just wanted to get that on the record. Anyway, um, tell me everything that happened last night or at least everything you can remember. - Sure. Like I told Sonny, I was watching a movie, and I heard a dog barking next door. Didn't think much of it. And then there was a scream afterwards. Huh, that's when I got up to see what was going on. - And how long was that dog barking before you heard the scream? - I don't know, TV was on, I didn't really notice at first. - Yeah, so at what point did you get up to go check it out and was it before or after the scream? - After. I turned the TV off and went to the door. - And could you still hear the screaming at the door? - No, no. It stopped by then. I called 911. - Hmm. What'd you think it was? - Oh, I assumed it was Mrs. Stirgard. - You heard the dog barking and then a scream that sounded like Mrs. Stirgard, but you didn't go over there to check it out? - It would've been safer not to. - For who? - What are you driving at? - Oh, no, no, no. Hey, look, I'm just trying to get a picture here, you know? I mean, you like the woman, she was nice, and why not just go over and try to lend a helping hand if she's in trouble? It just seems a little, a little cold. That's all. - Okay, okay, look, I just... Last spring, I heard that you dug out Dave Harper after his truck slid off the road into the gully after all the rain that we had. So this, I don't know, this just doesn't seem like you. You know, I mean, I've gotta believe your first instinct was to go over there and help. - It was, actually. - So why didn't you? - I heard something. - After the scream? - Yeah, it was, it was like an animal sound. - An animal sound. Wha-Wha-What kind? - I, I don't know. It wasn't like any sound I'd ever heard before. - Was it a growl like a bear? - Not exactly, it... Well, I don't know if I could identify a bear from this distance anyway, but it wasn't like any bear I'd ever heard. - All right. Well, can you describe what it sounded like? - Well, it had a kind of a hiss. - A hiss, like a snake? - No, no, I, I know this sounds weird, but I don't know how else to describe it. It was loud even over here and, and it was like a roar, but there was a definite hiss to it. - And that scared you enough to call the police? - Yeah. - Did you hear anything else after the hiss? - No, but I didn't go outside until the police showed up. - Did you tell Sonny that? - Yeah. I told him I heard an animal noise. He didn't ask any further. - What do you wanna do? - Huh. Let's give it a bit to cool down. I wanna check out the woods behind Helen's. See if we can find another hole. - Max, we've been back and forth across her yard now for two hours. - We'll find it. We haven't been this far out yet. - Bottom line is I just don't wanna be out here chasing our tails. What? Why are you stopping? - Another coincidence. - Holy- - Shit. - Tracks everywhere. Here, you start around the other side. - Okay. Well they appear to be the same anyway, that's good. I wonder if... - What? Wonder if what? What the fuck is it, Max? Okay, have a nice weekend, bye-bye. - Okay. And? That's fine. Hey, hey, where are you going? - Hey, I have some faxes coming in for Doug Bradley. - $8.47. - Um, sorry, what? - $8.47. - Uh... Keep the change. Thanks. You have got to see this. - Reptilian? Like a lizard? - Apparently. - Well, I don't know how I feel about that. - What the hell is this thing? Where did it come from? - I don't know, but just as important, how long has it been here? Come here. You gotta look at this. Okay. So I went through most of the local papers from the surrounding counties, and I found a number of suspicious or at least what I deemed to be suspicious attacks. Take a look at these dates. Backward from this year. So in October of 2017, two people were killed in Knox County. In September of the same year, there's one on Kennebec. Then another in Cumberland in November of 2016. Till we move back to October of 2013, where five people were killed between Oxford and Franklin County. Now each time this seems to be happening in either September, October, or November, Other than a few rare attacks in December, they completely stop after that. I mean, I don't know why, but it's gotta be some kind of pattern, it's gotta be. I traced it back to 1958, for Christ's sake. - How could this not be noticed? I mean, there has to be something. - If there is, no one's ever said anything, and there's never been a living witness. - What about this guy Dobson? What's his deal? I mean, his dog gets killed near his house, he hears it, but sees nothing? - I thought the same thing. I looked him up. Clint Dobson, he's over in Otis, tried calling him on whatever number I could find, but disconnected. - Let's take a ride. So you said there was a pattern? Well, what's the pattern? - The counties. See, I started with the most recent and I worked my way back. The original idea was to try to find a kind of hotbed for where most of the attacks occurred, but when I started to mark off each one, something else happened. - I see a bunch of circles. - Mm-hmm. Those are migration patterns. - But how can that be? - I don't know. That's what we're gonna find out. - Have you ever heard of a creature that has this kind of migration cycle? - No, but I'm far from an expert. - It looks like each fall, it moves on to a new location. - Mm-hmm. - And it sets up shop, attacking, one, two, three, five times. - Yep. Keep going. - And then by the time it circles back around to the original spot, it's like seven to 10 years later. So it has a clean slate at that point. Jesus. - Welcome to the dark side. - Max. - Um, excuse me. Excuse me! - Oh my God. You scared me. - Sorry about that. Uh, do you live here? - I do. What can I do for you? - We're looking for a Clint Dobson. Does he still live here? - I'm afraid you're a little late. He passed a few years back. I'm his daughter, Marie. - Oh, I see, uh, I'm Max, and this is Harriet. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Don't be. He was an asshole. - What about your mother? Is she still around? - No, she had even less of a tolerance for his bullshit than I did. She left a long time ago. What is this about? - Oh, we're from the Trenton Record. Uh, we had wanted to ask him some questions about when his dog was attacked and killed a while back. - You mean Blackie? You , you came over from Trenton to ask about that? Why do you wanna know? - Did he ever say anything about it? You know, anything about that night? - Not to me. I was away at school at the time. I swear, he loved that dog more than us, but as you can imagine, we weren't on the best of terms at that time. So I didn't talk to him much. I know there's a, there's a fence back in there somewhere because of it. - Uh, any brothers or sisters who might have been around? - I have an older brother in California, but he was gone by then too. - What about any friends he might have told or you know, journals he might have had? - You kidding? My father could hold up his beer bottle and not much else. - Okay, well, it was worth a shot. Thanks for your time, Marie. We won't take up any more of it. - Thanks again. Actually, wait. You know, at the end he, he was pretty out of it with the drugs and everything. He kept slipping in and out of time. And one day he started talking about Blackie. He kept going on and on about the hiss getting him. Something like that. We all just thought he was talking nonsense, but there was something about the way he said it that it really stuck with me. The hiss. He kept repeating it. Scared me a little. Uh, is that anything? - It actually is. Thank you again. - Thanks. Okay. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm in. The problem is I just can't wrap my brain around the whole season thing. What is it about the months of October and November that bring it out? Why is it so active during those times? - I know, that is a big one. - We have to get Bill involved now. - Are you kidding me? All we have now are theories. Bill's way past that. - We need the help. Not, not to mention, he's gonna want something soon anyway. You can't keep this secret from him much longer. - Oh, I know. I'm just gonna have to get crafty, but, hey, that's my game. - I think you should play dumb, that's really your game. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh. Well, look who found a sense of humor. Hey, I taught you well. - Oh, glad you could take credit for that too. So now what? - Well there's still a bunch of stuff I gotta get through tonight, but tomorrow, I mean, we need to find out everything we can about reptiles. Maybe that'll least send us in a direction, but you know, my Internet's been backing up, so let's go to your place. - I can't tomorrow. Bill assigned me to the Beauregard job. - The dog show? - Pays, yes. A gig's a gig. I ought to use my camera for something that actually brings in money. - I can't believe I'm getting usurped by a bunch of animals that eat their own shit. - Hey, there will also be dogs there. Relax. I should be out by two, the latest. - All right, well then meet me at the library, I guess. I'll use the computers there. It looks like I'll be getting my mail there for a bit. - Hmm. Fair enough. What stuff do you have to go over tonight? - Uh, well, I need to go over your photos more, and then there's some articles I haven't even touched yet. Why? - Take a break? Head over to Millie's for a drink? - You buying? - Damn, this story better pan out. - Hmm. - Seriously. You're a great journalist. So why are you freelancing for this shitty-ass paper? You should be in staff in Boston or New York. - Mm, no. I would never ever work for a paper that covers the Yankees, you know that. Hey, can I have another? - Jesus Christ. Can't you be serious for a second. - You ever work in a factory, Harry? - What? - Well my dad did. He managed a hack and slash unit there. - I have no idea what you just said. - Selective deforestation is what they call it. - Okay. So what does that have to do with anything? - Uh, my dad died on the job. - I didn't know that. I'm sorry. - Who knew that's what slaving away at a job for 32 years gets you? You know, one minute you're working your ass off 50, 60, 70 hours a week outta some half-cocked notion to send your son to college and the next, well, the next you're not. - Half-cocked? That's a pretty good reason. - Oh my God. It's just such a fucking waste of life. - You can't look at it like that. - Well, maybe not, but I do anyway. Yeah, it made me realize how fragile everything was. How you can't assume anything and the thought of going down that same path was so goddamn suffocating. I mean, you didn't grow up here, right? I mean, you don't realize how bad it can get. That wasn't gonna happen to me. No. I was gonna take my shots, wherever that led. No nets, no regrets. - And yet here you are. - Did you know that after my dad died, I left for five years? - Why'd you come back? - Oh, my mom got sick. Ovarian cancer, not good. The paper was looking for a journalist and I needed, well, something while I was here. She died about a year later and I would've left again for good if it wasn't for Nancy. She and Charlie were still living in the house their parents left him at the time, and Nancy was working editorials for Bill. And here I come blowing in like the wind. My head's still spinning from everything that happened with my mom. God, I was such a mess. She probably saved my life. - It's because you actually started putting down roots. - It was a fantasy. And what did that get me? Dead fiance, that's what. Nancy lived her whole life in this damn town out of some obligation to these people. My dad wasted his life trying to do something that didn't need doing. And what did that get either of them? - Well, that's a shitty way to look at it. Nancy was here because she cared about these people, and your dad worked in order to give you something that he never had, something you needed. - I needed a father. I'm here right now because I have to be, but once I get my shot, I'm out. - Oh, bullshit. That is bullshit and you know it. You're here because you want to be here. No, because you love it here. No, because this place means something to you. It's your home. Why, why do you think you always come back? No, what were doing, it doesn't work in a vacuum and try as you might, you can't escape that. You're just too chickenshit to admit it. You think that by living on the outside and dating married women, it's easier to have one foot out the door, but that's just emotional suicide. And at some point you're gonna wake up and realize there's no one left who gives a fuck. - Now then, what is this sudden interest in my goals and ambitions? - I'm leaving. - What? - I got a job in Boston. - Where did this come from? - I, I applied for it a couple weeks back. They made me an offer two days ago. - Huh. And why didn't you tell me? - I don't know. I guess I thought, I... I don't know what I thought. - Wait a minute. Wait, is this why you agreed to help me on this? Is it? - Not entirely. - Oh, not entirely. That's great. I feel so much better. Thank you. - Dammit, Max. I'm here. What's the difference? - Yeah, for now. I mean, when are you going? - The 10th. - The 10th? That, that's next week. Fuck! What about the story? - What about the story? Tell Bill now. - Oh! - Let's show him what we've got. He can bring in people - No, no, no, no. - to help. - I am not giving it to those jackals. You have to stay on. - I can't. - You have to. I can't tell anyone. Not now. We just had a huge breakthrough and we're close. This is my big shot once and for all. You can't leave yet. - I'll, I'll stay as long as I can. That's the best I have to offer. You are really up fucking up my shit. - I know, and I'm sure this hasn't gone the way you planned. Just please, just do this one last thing for me and I won't ask you anymore. - I worry about you sometimes. - I'm fine. Just please, just, just help me on this. - Fine. Uh, I should go. I have an early day. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, yeah. Tomorrow. - Goodnight, Max. - Good night. - Another round, Max? Max, can I get you another round? - Um, no, I'm fine, Kell. Thanks. I'm taking off. - Okay, hon. Just be careful driving home. Max, you all right? - Uh, yeah, of course. Sorry, uh, never better. - Hey. - It's about time. I'm fricking drowning here. I need your eyes. - Sorry, I got held up. Uh... Ever see 30 dogs decide they wanna bite at some guy's hot dog at the same time? It will change your life. I see you've abandoned the interwebs. - Mm. I got desperate. I've tried everything I can think of. Feeding patterns, migration courses, changes in temperature, time of year, different breeds of species. I, I can't find anything about a reptile that's nocturnal, feeds at one time of year, has a very large but steady migratory pattern, and is big enough to attack a human. Nothing. I'm tapped out. - How close do you think this thing is to the end of its cycle? - Close. Look at the pattern. As far back as I've look, it attacks three, maybe five times at the most before moving on. - It's like it stocks up before hibernating. - Mm-hmm, and whatever it is, it's smart. It knows how to stay hidden. So this may be all we get, and then it'll be gone and may not resurface again for at least a year. - That's a tight window. - Yeah. I feel like I'm slamming my head against a brick wall because of it. I don't know. I mean, maybe you can find the connection. - Okay, but we need another entry point. Let's, let's bring in a game warden or an expert from Portland. Let's show them what we've got. Lay it out for them, see what they say. - I don't know. Maybe you're right. You call Heath again and ask him- - No, that's not what I meant. - Ask him if there's been, I don't know, any increase in bear attacks in this area over the last couple of years, all right? If we're lucky, he'll think we're just following up for a sideline story for everything that's been going on around here. If we get really lucky, I mean, uh, who knows? Maybe we'll get some details about the attacks that are being withheld. - Max, what's that gonna prove? We need new information from a real source? What, what could he say that could possibly help us? - Well, we won't know until he says it now, will we? - That's asinine. You're just stalling. - For what? - For the big break or something like it. I just don't see how we can get it without tipping our hand at least a little. - Shit, just... Okay, uh, look, I'll make you a deal. Call Heath and see what he says. Just see what he says. If nothing comes of it then, I don't know, we'll go your way. Sound like a plan? - That's another thing. Why am I calling him? He's your friend. You should call him yourself. - Harry, come on. Really? Why are we quibbling over things like this? Very important things I have to be doing instead. Besides, I hate to have to owe the guy anything. He's kind of a snake. You know the type? - Yeah. Yeah, I know the type. - Oh, hi, Max. - Oh, hi, Mrs. Atler. How are things? - Ah, well, this rain is knocking the hell out of my arthritis, but other than that, I'm living. - Oh, guess that's a plus these days. - Oh, it's awful what happened to Helen, isn't it? - I know. It's a shame. - Max, listen, Pippet hasn't been snooping around your garbage cans again, has he? - Um, no, Mrs. Atler, why? - Well, the little sucker took off on me last night and he hasn't been back this morning, and I just thought maybe he slipped under the fence and was, had at your garbage, you know? - No, ma'am, at least not that I've seen. - I'm starting to get a bit worried. Remember last year when Susie McClellan's terrier got caught in that bear trap out behind Leo's place? - My God, that's right. - Oh yeah. It was an awful mess. I just hope that Pippet has more sense than that. - I'm sure he does. I know old guy's outfoxed me more than a couple times, trying to chase him away from my cans. - Well that's Pippet for ya. Hmm, well, if you see him, can you just walk over and let me know? - Absolutely. I'm sure Pip's just having himself a little party with his friends. - Mm, don't I know it. - He'll be back. - Bye-bye, Max. Keep an eye out. - Why is there a hole in it? Look, you should get another one. It looks like something was digging in it. - Uh, no, that's fine. I'll take it. - Are you sure? 'Cause it looked like someone fingered it. - No. No. Uh, just ring it up. I'll take it. Holy fuck. - Hey, you want your change? - Keep it. Actually, I don't know, I was thinking I'm gonna need that. Thank you. - Frome. - Bill. What are you doing here? - We're having a birthday party for my niece. You, you remember Jackie, right? - Oh yeah, sure. They, uh, still over on Bay Street? - Yeah, we ran out of drinks for the kids, so I'm making the run. - Oh, lucky you. - Oh, I know. Look, I'm really glad I ran into you. We need to talk. - Can it wait? I'm onto something. I really gotta go. - Max, where's my story? - Bill, I am so close right now, I can taste it. I think I might have just figured something out. When you hear about it, you're gonna piss yourself. - Can you prove it? - Not yet, but soon. All I need- - Max, please. We really need to talk. - Oh, we really need to talk. Sure. - I agreed to let your freelance because I thought it would be good for you to take some time off after Nancy died. Look, Max, you've given me some really great stories over the years, but there comes a time when I have to weigh what I get from you against what it takes to get it. - I can't believe you would say that. - Drop it. I am just tired of dealing with your shit. And the truth is, we don't need it. I don't need it. - What are you saying? - You're gonna need someplace else to find your money from. - Are you kidding me, Bill? After everything I've given you? - Huh. - I mean, what about this story? You promised me. - That's right, I did. And if whatever this is that you think that you're chasing shows up gold, I'll buy it, but that's it. I'm done. You understand? - I understand. You just wait and see. You're gonna want me back. You just wait and see. - I'm sorry, Max. Maybe it's time for you to move along. You're way past due to leave again anyway. Now you don't have an excuse. Take care of yourself. - Bill. Fuck. Harry, it's me. Hey, don't worry about calling Heath. I'll do that. Meet me at my house tomorrow morning instead. I need you to check on something else for me. - Fuck! Jesus Christ! You scare the balls off me. Little early to be drinking, isn't it. - Come on. You gotta see this. - What? - Come on. - What the hell is this about? Holy shit. - Whoa, don't. - Have you seen it? - No, but Mrs. Atler's dog went missing. Heard some strange noises in the woods last night. So could be. - That sells it. - Uh, what are you doing? - Calling Charlie? - Are you nuts? - Uh, Sheriff Murdoch, please. This has gone on too far. We need help. - Do you realize what this could do? - Hey Charlie, it's Harriet. I appreciate it. All right. See you later. Okay. He'll be here after his shift. - Goddammit. - Let's go back inside. I have some stuff you need to hear about. - What's the point now? - Don't be a baby. Come on. - Hmm. Beer? - Seriously? All right. What do you got? - A lot, actually. I don't know what it all means yet, but I did some backtracking and I found some interesting shit. - Do tell, kemosabe. - So I started out by going back about 20 years, which is as far back as the internet would carry me on the daily weather. I took each date that you gave me of a supposed bear attack, and, goddammit, if it didn't correspond to some kind of rainstorm the previous night. What's more, during the years when there were multiple attacks in a given place, it was during the biggest rainfall season. - I can't believe it. - If that blew your dick, wait till you hear this. I decided to keep going back further. So, I went to the library this morning and I checked the newspaper weather forecast against the earlier attacks. And to the fucking letter, there was some kind of rainstorm listed. Now who knows if it actually did rain or not, but the coincidence is overwhelming. - Wait, but how far back did you go? - 75 Years. - Huh. - And who knows how much further that goes back? Are we saying what I think we're saying? - Yeah, the rain. I mean, it makes sense. - Right, but why? - I have a theory. I talked to Heath, I asked him if he knew of any creature that hunt specifically in the rain and he said, "Not presently." - What, what does that mean? - That's what I said. Do you know what he told me? You know what, let me get my notes so I say it right. - Have you ever heard of the Holocene Epoc era? - No. - No, me either. Anyway, during this time, most of the larger predatory animals began to be phased out by the smaller, faster animals, but there is some evidence to show that a certain number of the larger creatures began to use the rain as cover to hunt their prey through the thick underbrush of a jungle. - Right, but would it be possible to have one of these creatures alive today? - No, no, no. They were around for such a short time. It would be very unlikely. - So where does that leave us? - Oh, hang on now. I asked 'em, I said, "What if one of these creatures did survive? You know, what if it was able to evolve as well and grow sharper, faster, pass the skills on from generation to generation?" And he said. - Well, it'd be reptilian, that's for sure. They adapt easier and have longer life spans, but its size would come down. It's gotta find a balance with the animals around it. - Makes sense. Life, uh, finds a way. - Right. Now this reptile would most likely be nocturnal, you know, because it would increase its chances of staying out of sight and its hunting success. I mean, especially since it'd be fighting off extinction. - What about size? How much smaller does he think it would've gotten? Like the size of a dog or what? - Get this. - I don't know. A small bear, maybe. - You've gotta be shitting me? - Nope. I couldn't believe it when he said that, but, of course, then he went on to say how this is all theory and the chances of a creature like that avoiding detection by society are astronomical, blah, blah, blah. - Well, at least we should have enough for a story at this point. - Yeah, well, maybe, but I want proof. - Why? Uh! - Because I don't want just a base hit, I want a grand slam and proof will do that. Otherwise, it's just another crazy story. A Cryptid. - A what? - Cryptid. It's a term using Cryptozoology. It refers to a creature that is believed to exist, but scientifically unproven. - Like Bigfoot and Loch Ness? - Exactly. - Mm. Well, at least we have credibility on our side. - Clearly. - So why not use Charlie? If we can convince him of this, maybe he can provide us the proof we need. - You know what? You might be right. He tags it and bags it, we get everything we need. - Yes. Yes. Let the people with the guns find the murder creature. I'm definitely a fan of that. You should call Bill Seriously, this is good news. And he's like 20 stages beyond anxious to get something from you. - Yeah, no, I will, I will. I just, you know, first we gotta convince Charlie. - How hard do you think that'll be? - Uh, well, Charlie's a rock, tough as hell with no imagination, but he's also very smart. He's trained to look at facts and to draw conclusions, so that reason alone, I think he'll believe us. - I don't believe you. - Oh, come on Charlie. Look at what we have here. All right? I mean, you saw the holes. You heard the stories. Wait, you wanna see the map again? - No. - Harry, show 'em the map again. - No, I do not need to see your damn map again. I have heard everything you said. - Okay, then why won't you just accept the possibility that this could be true? - Because it's foolish. You have one half-baked theory based on another. It's like a house of cards flipped upside down. Everything you believe in, everything you think is right, is based on a leap of faith the size of Montana. - Yeah, but what if you take that leap, just for a second, what if you open that brick you call a head and just explore the idea? - 'Cause I don't have time to explore the idea. The mayor is so far up my ass, I am spitting out buttons. And believe it or not, genius, it's really pretty simple. As the population grows around here, we keep pushing the forest back further and further, limiting the space and the food that is available to these bears. Yes, bears. Eventually, bam! They collide. - The crazy thing is I believe you're right. Just not the part you think. All of these things you're talking about, deforestation, increase in population. I mean, hell, throw climate change and global warming on top of that. We've been cornering it, forcing it out into the open to get bolder out of fear of extinction. - All right. How do you explain this rain business, hmm? Why doesn't it happen in the spring? That's the rainiest time. - Uh, not here. October and November have the most rainfall each year, most in inches and most days. All right, fine. Then how do you explain the disappearance every time we send a hunting party out? - Coincidence. - Coinc...? Jesus. Max, open your goddamn eyes! Are you so hard up for a story now that you will believe anything that comes through, even if it's not true? And you, Harriet. I wouldn't have thought you would get mixed up in something like this. - Okay, look, I get it. It's hard to accept at first, but it makes sense. No, just, just take that hole outside, for instance. Have you ever seen a bear make something like that? Or, or leave those kinds of tracks outside it? What about the M.E. report? What about that? - What about it? - Oh, cl, clearly it backs up what we're describing. - How do you know that? I never even saw an M.E. report. Oh, okay. - How is that possible? - There was a problem at the lab. Some samples got contaminated. We're still waiting. Are you saying you've seen something? Where did you get this? - Where do you think? Charlie, that first day I saw you in the street, when the driver hit this thing, you said something about this bothered you. Do you remember that? - Of course. - What was it? What bothered you? - The victim was partially eaten. - What? - Most of his internal organs were gone as well as parts of his arms and legs. - And what about Mrs. Stirgard? - Same thing. - I don't get it. - Generally, bears kill out of defense. They, it's like someone threatens their territory or they're young. - Meaning not for food. - That is not always the case. - Oh my God, come on! I've read enough about this in the last few days to know that it's only in extremely rare cases that bears attack out of hunger, and now we've had what? Two in less than a week. That's damn near impossible. - Three. - What? - What do you mean three? - Who was the third? - A horse was killed a few days ago. - Oh my God. Use your damn head, man! - This is bullshit, bullshit! - But the... - I'm sorry. The mayor needs this cleared up as soon as possible. He believes it's a bear and so do I. I have to. I cannot pin the safety of this town on some mythical creature that no one has ever seen before. - What if you're wrong? What if this thing doesn't run and hide in the next county? How bad will it get then? - Look, we are sending a hunting party out tomorrow. So if I'm wrong, and what you say is true, we will know. - Nancy would've believed me. Fuck you! - She would have, and you know it. - Fuck you! Of all the slimy, lowdown things you could do that is the worst! How dare you use her for this? - Use her? I'm not using her for anything. I'm trying to get you to see what is right the fuck in front of your face! - You are looking out for yourself, which is what you do best! And I never understood what she saw in you ever! - Okay, good, good, good. Now it comes out. Well, you know what? Neither did I, but that doesn't change the fact that she loved me and I loved her more than I, more than I could have possibly imagined. You're just pissed off 'cause I was able to give her something that you couldn't. - I gave her everything. When our parents died, I raised her the best that I could to do right by them! I gave her everything! - You gave her rules then regulations. You gave her fear of the world around her. You gave her a prison. - I gave her protection! - A lot of good that did! Ooh! Whoa, whoa, Charlie. Just... - I can't. I just, I can't. - Charlie. - I just can't. - Well, that could have gone better. - You are a charmer. - Fuck. Now what? - I know a game warden in Portland. Um, I could go talk to him. See if he'll come here. Then we can try to go to work on him. - You mean like torture him? I'm really gonna miss you. - Me too. - I'm sorry about all this. I'm sorry I took the only person who actually believes me and put you in the middle of this shitstorm. - Thank you for saying so. - Well the truth is, you're the best person I've ever worked with and, uh, well, a real friend. I just thought if... I don't know, if we found this thing together, then... I don't even know what I thought, I just... Anyway, I, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Despite my complaints, you make me see things in a different way, and I like that Be safe, okay? - Aren't I always? - I should be back in a couple hours anyway. Here. Mm. Uh, wait here for a second? - Sure. - Thanks. - Afternoon, sheriff. - Hey, Beth. - The mayor is here to see you. - What? - The mayor. He's in your office. - Charlie. - Tom. - Uh, Charlie, it's me. I think there's not much time left. It's supposed to rain tonight but not again for a while, and by that time, who knows where it'll be? And I can't let this stand. You know, not now. So I'm headed out at sundown. I know you don't buy that story in the paper. You knew it then and you sure as hell know it now. I just hope, I just hope you believe me because I'm asking for your help. Okay? Uh... Please, please help me. I didn't think you'd show. - Where'd you get the gun? - It was my dad's. - Yeah, well when was the last time you fired it? - I don't know. Probably when was 16. Are you here to stop me? Because you can save it. That fucker killed Harriet and I'm not- - Max, I just don't want you to blow your foot off. - I saw the papers today. Get everything you wanted? - They did, and then some. - Everyone happy? - Almost everyone. Look, unfortunately, I couldn't get as many as I needed, what with the emergency being over and all, but I trust these guys. Uh, this is John Pendleton. He's the one whose horse got killed the other day. Might be related. - John. Deputy. - Max. - Thanks for coming out, guys. - No problem. It sucks about, Harriet. She was a special girl. - Yeah she was. Charlie fill you guys in one the details? - He did. I'm not quite sure I believe it, but I've never known Charlie to lie or even stretch the truth, so I'll take his word for it till I know better. - John's family owns a lot of the surrounding property that will most likely be headed through. - We've done our fair share of big game hunting, so we should be able to track this thing. - All right, listen up. We are going to stay in constant visual contact of each other, all right? You make sure that you always have a sight line to everybody else. No one goes off alone. You. I'm giving you six hours and that's it. Six hours, Max. When I call it, I call it. It's done. And I don't give a shit what you say, I will drag your ass out of there by your ears if I have to. - Charlie... Listen, I appreciate you guys coming down to help me, I do. All right, but you also need to understand that I'm here no matter what I'm headed out into those woods. I have to, but you don't. If it's what you say it is, then we've got bigger problems than just tonight. I am in. - He's right. If this thing killed Harriet, I'm fucking in. - And hell, I'm the only one with the legal right to authorize this so if that means wandering through the woods in the middle of the night with the likes of you then, then so be it. - Let's go. - Say, Max, come here for a second. I, um... About the other day, um, didn't- - I know, Charlie. You don't have to say anything. - No, I do. I do. I did not mean it. - I know, neither did I. - You're a good man, Max. And I consider you family. - Thank you, Charlie. - Let's do this. - Hey, shut that off. - Yeah, why? - Don't use that unless you absolutely have to. - Why? - It kills night vision. You just let your eyes adjust to the darkness, you'll be able to see everything. Use that flashlight, you can only see what's in the beam of light. - How do you know that? - Night hunting. - Hold up, guys. John, hold that. I wanna cross-check this. Okay, uh, this area here, it's our best chance of spotting it. I figure if we push east, we can skirt past Prospect Hill and hit this patch of forest on the south side. Then if we spread out across this old farm, we can cover a good stretch of land. - Okay, so, there's a creek that runs through here and through here, and there's a small canyon on the other side. Now, if we just stay on this narrow band, we should be able to, uh, cover a lot of the back part of the property in no time at all. Now, that old farm you're talking about, that's Jackson Farm. Now I've been there. Uh, thing it likes to dig, right? - Yeah, deep tunnels. - See this patch just above Jackson Farm by Buzzard Creek Trail? No rocks, no trees, just tracts of open land. - All right. Sounds like a plan. - Ho. It's still fresh. - There's more on this tree. - Something got hit here. It's headed northeast. - Well, it's like your idea about the Jackson Farm was right. - Well, I'm beginning to think that I'm not too happy about that. - You okay, John? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let's go. - Looks like you might get your proof after all. - No offense, Charlie, fuck you if you still think I care about that. - That's what I wanna hear. - Damn. - That's it. The tracks just stop. - Christ. - Farmhouse is that way. Holy shit! - John! - Get to the farm! - Sonny, Sonny, Sonny, no, come on! Come on! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - We need to keep moving. - No, Max is in there! - We need to keep moving, we don't know - Cover me, cover me! - where that thing is! - Max! - Charlie, we have to go. - Max! Max! - Charlie, now! - Oh, shit. - Max, shit! - Charlie! Sonn... Son of a bitch. Charlie! Shit. Goddammit! Oh! Motherfucker! Are you fucking kidding me? Mm. Please. C-C-Come on. Come on, come on, please. Come on. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Mm. Shit! Fuck! You know what? All right. Let's think about it. All right, go this way. Come on! Keep going, keep going. Did you hit it? - I'm doubtful. I couldn't see shit. So much for night vision. - Now what? - I don't know. - Do you think Max is still alive? - I don't know, maybe. - Shit, man, is there anything you do know? - Yeah, I know that if Max is still alive, we gotta figure out a way to draw that creature away from its den. - How do we do that? - We gotta go back in. - Wait, wait. I think I have an idea. Now, given this thing's nature, it must primarily hunt by scent. - Whoa, whoa, what the fuck? Sonny! - The only way that we can attract that thing away from Max and towards us is to give it some incentive, like a fresh wound. - Are you fucking crazy? - Maybe, but if we can put this scent on some trees in one area, I bet it'll come running. - And if it doesn't? - Then I'm an idiot and I'm gonna need some stitches. - All right. Let's find a spot. - What the fuck? Oh, what the fuck? Oh, Jesus. Oh no. There's something moving. Oh, fuck. Oh! Fuck it. - That should do it. Den is downwind from here so it smells this, should lead him right down this way. - What if the rain washes the scent away? - It'll take a while. - Cover me. Fresh wound. Jesus, Sonny. Oh, Jesus. We gotta get you outta here. - No, go, go after it. - No, man! You're hurt! - Really, I think it looks worse that it is. - No, I think it looks pretty fucking bad. All right? We gotta get you outta here. I'll come back for Max. - No. No, it's wounded. You, you can't lose it now. I'll be okay. - All right, look at me. You take this, all right? That thing comes back around, that has a lot more stopping power. Don't fucking die! You good? - Yeah. - All right. - Yeah, go, go. Oh! Oh fuck. Fuck! Yuck. Oh, Jesus! Oh, fuck. Uh! - Max? - Sonny? Fuck! Sonny, I'm down here! - Max? - Sonny? Holy shit. - Max? - Sonny, holy shit. - Max. - Where's Charlie? - I, I don't know, he... I heard a scream. It might have been him. - What? You gotta help me get outta here man. - Do you have any rope? - Oh fuck. I was gonna ask you the same thing. Shit. - Man, we gotta get outta here. This, this thing could be back any second. - Yeah, I know. She's not gonna be pleased. - What? - Nothing. How am I gonna get outta here? - I, I don't know. - Fuck. Fuck. Wait. Wait. Oh fuck. I have an idea. Wait, I'll be back. Okay. Oh, for Christ sake. Oh, Jesus. Gross. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. - Hurry, Max. - I'm doing the best I can. - Do better. Max? Max? Max? I got ya, buddy. I got ya. Well, well, well. Nice of you to drop by. - Shit. - How do you feel? - Oh, you know, everything hurts. - Hmm. No doubt. You gave me quite the scare. - Oh, oh, wow. - You were covered in so much blood, I wasn't sure where your injuries were. - Jesus. Oh. - You remember what happened? - Oh, I remember you shot me. - Well, just a little bit. - Oh, God, don't make me laugh. - Had a hell of a time getting you out of there. - Right. Shit, Charlie, the cave! We gotta go back or- - Take it easy, Max. - No, no. We gotta go back now! - Dammit, Max, why on earth would I wanna go back there? - There are eggs! - What? - Eggs. They could be anywhere by now? - The creature's body's gone. So how do we explain this? - I don't see how we can. Well, we can take the eggshells to an expert and hope we can get them to believe us. - You think they will? - Did you? - So what then? - It's getting cold. They'll be looking for place to lay low and stay warm through the winter. So if we're lucky, these things won't come out again till next spring, but with this many, it'll be worse. - And if so? - I'd grab every man, woman and child that could hold a gun and get ready for the carnage to start. - And where will you be? - Home. ♪ There's a monster in the closet ♪ ♪ A creature by the bed ♪ ♪ Demons in the shadows ♪ ♪ Someone's gonna get dead ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ So run ♪ ♪ You got to hide ♪ ♪ It's not time for heroes ♪ ♪ Mojo or ego ♪ ♪ When blood is being spattered♪ ♪ The only thing that matters is to make it out alive, yeah ♪ ♪ These clues are just illusions♪ ♪ Or so the doctor said ♪ ♪ The rain is soaked in terror ♪ ♪ Someone's gonna get dead ♪ ♪ So run ♪ ♪ You got to hide ♪ ♪ No time for heroes ♪ ♪ Mojo or ego ♪ ♪ When blood is being splattered♪ ♪ The only thing that matters is to make it out alive, yeah ♪ ♪ I know I saw something ♪ ♪ It was raining like hell ♪ ♪ There were holes in the earth♪ ♪ And I wanted to yell, help ♪ ♪ I had no reception ♪ ♪ No bars in my cell, damn ♪ ♪ I couldn't run and I couldn't hide ♪ ♪ I was lost in the woods ♪ ♪ And oh, God, oh, God, oh, God♪ ♪ The ungodly smell ♪ ♪ So run ♪ ♪ You got to hide ♪ ♪ It's no time for heroes ♪ ♪ Mojo or ego ♪ ♪ When blood is being splattered♪ ♪ The only thing that matters is to make it out alive, yeah ♪ ♪ Call the police ♪
