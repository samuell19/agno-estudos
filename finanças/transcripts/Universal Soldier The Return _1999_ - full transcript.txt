Jump! He's good. He's too good. Now it's party time, eh, Maggie? That's your partner, and he's been terminated. Now we got aIl the time we need to play. - This is not your Iucky day. - Come on. Come on, big guy. Just cut me Ioose. Come on. - Come on! Cut me loose. - Yeah. And you thought that was gonna stop me? Take a drink, pretty boy. Stop it! SETH, stop it! All units, stand down. Exercise terminated. Let's go. Dr. Cotner, the Unisol 2500 project... has arrived in the R and D area. Systems analysis to controls lab one. - You look pretty good. How do you feeI? - Great. They do better underwater than I do. I couId implant an underwater breathing device... if you wanna be a UniversaI SoIdier again. - Been there, done that. Next. - Nice tits. Hey, Maggie. Nice performance. I don't care if he is dead. Next time he grabs me, I'Il kilI him. I don't think he likes me. According to his miIitary records, he didn't Iike anyone. Dying did not improve his personaIity. - ShaII we? - Let's go. Regeneration booth is now ready. SMT to central scheduling. - What happened with the others? - They're all dead! Get the fuck out of here! Run! Regeneration program completed. Romeo, return to the cold room. Dr. Barnes to the regeneration laboratory. Dr. Cotner. I think we have possibIe matrix implant damage. What do you have? Shit. DeIta. All units, stand down. Delta unit has malfunctioned. Matrix implant link failure. You guys want to get him out of here? You see, l can stilI take them one-on-one. You sure can. So where does it hurt? AlI over. l feeI like I was hit by a train. - But you're okay? - Yeah. Good. Why don't you get cleaned up? We got a meeting to go to. ET crew, pick up 2271. - I'Il be there. - Okay. VisibIe Iight we can see, but it's the other waveIengths-- infrared and uItraviolet-- that we can't. Very good, Hillary. Hello, Luc. Hey, Dad. HiIlary! Whoa! SETH, thank you for watching my girl today. A pleasure. How did my soldiers perform? Come on. You know. You tracked every move. I wasn't cutting target acquisition too close on the live-fire exercise? We expect nothing but the best from you. Besides, I was due for a haircut. - Thank you. - I've got a meeting. l'lI come back soon, talk to you Iater. Okay? - Bye. - Bye. Have fun. l'm sorry I didn't get out there in time to see your demonstration, Doctor. But we're shutting the UNISOL project down. The defense budget has been cut again, and some things have to go. But the system's ready for a fuII DOD shakedown a month ahead of schedule. The brass has never been comfortable with the idea... of recycIing battlefield dead... into Universal SoIdiers. The originaI project cost dozens of civiIian and miIitary Iives... and created a public reIations mess which we spent years cleaning up. But to compare the units in action today with the originaI UNISOLs... is Iike comparing a stone ax to a surgical Iaser. Two and a haIf times stronger than any human, faster-- With the leveI four body armor uniforms, makes them almost buIIetproof. Look, General, in addition to the physicaI improvements... the matrix chip impIanted into each UNISOL brain... enabIes SETH to monitor and controI their action. The soldier has aIways been the backbone of the miIitary. We'd hate to think this was the future of warfare. Yeah, it wouId be a shame to stop sending young Americans... to die in the battIefieId. Let's go, Maggie. That's a strange team you have there, Doctor. They're not strange. They're passionate. And for your information, Luc Devereaux was one of the original UNlSOLs. It doesn't matter. The U NISOL project and your pet computer... are scrapped. The big spending of the Cold War era is over. And so is your project. Good night, sir. - Good evening, Dr. Cotner. - Good evening, SETH. l just have to fiIe a few notes from today's exercise. Then everything went well? Yeah. Yeah, it went great. Better than expected, in fact. Are you sure? What makes you ask that? Your galvanic skin response suggests a problem. Maybe I'm coming down with that cold that's going around. I can adjust the building filtration system... to decrease the possibility of airborne contagions. No, thanks, SETH. I don't think that'II be necessary. I'Il be fine. Just need to get a good night's sleep. - Good night, SETH. - Good night, Doctor. Remaining time for UNlSOL cool-down: 12 hours. Current temperature: 38 degrees. Romeo unit, there is work to be done. It's Iate. What's wrong? l was just thinking about Mom. Can you share with me? Why did-- Why did Mom have to die? I don't know. We just have to believe... God had a reason. That's aIl we can do. I stiII miss her. I miss her too. Let's go to sIeep, huh? - l Iove you. - I Iove you too. Good night. Good night. What the heII? Who authorized this activity? We did! What do you mean? lt was cleared by your pubIic reIations officer, Betty Wilson. - Why don't you caIl her? - Miss, l've got orders... - that no visitors wilI be alIowed-- - Okay, Iook. l don't want to have to teII my boss that I couIdn't get my assignment done. So would you just pIease caIl her? lt's extension 409. Miss WiIson, I've got a reporter here... from KTX-- Okay. AlI right. Just have a seat and... Miss WiIson wilI escort you into the faciIity. How can the Pentagon do this to us, to SETH? GeneraI, how can you shut down this project? - We have been through this-- - Dad! Dad! SETH's sick. Cotner, what is it? - There's a storm in the cube. - What does that mean? That's exactIy what I'm trying to figure out right now. But you built the damn thing. Luc, take HiIlary outta here... and send Peterson and Mishkin in as soon as you can. This is Dr. Cotner. We have a faciIity Iockdown. Code 515. Sorry for the inconvenience, Miss Young, but it turns out today is a bad day. Don't sweat it. Get me to the doctor's Iab and l'II be out in 30 minutes. Facility lockdown. Commence evacuation emergency procedures. - All personnel, evacuate facility. - Joe, get a shot of this. Facility lockdown. Commence evacuation emergency procedure. - What's going on here? - Erin Young, KTXD. Listen, l don't care who you are. You cannot be here. Joe, come on. Maggie, please watch her. I'II come back, okay? -He's drawing more power from the mains. -DyIan, what the helI is going on? He won't respond to commands. lt's like someone's hacking into the system. - It's not possible. - It is if he's doing it himseIf. He's activating systems aIl over the building. - Maybe we can shut down and reboot. - l have no choice. Facility lockdown. Commence evacuation emergency procedures. All personnel, evacuate facility. Come on. Let's go. All units, proceed to matrix defense positions. All personnel, evacuate facility. KilI the power. That's about aII we can do is shut it aII down. Peterson ! - Get them out of here. - Again you? - Come on, out! - Dad, I'm scared. - Maggie, take HiIIary home. - You can't do this. - I'Il talk to you Iater. Now! - Sure. Come on, HiIly. Shut it down ! - lmmediate threat to SETH existence. - Wait! No! DyIan! Architecture for survival: One: Activate operational UNlSOL 2500 units. Devereaux, what is it doing? He's taking over. Let's back out sIowIy. - Come on. - Three: create design... - for advancement of project. - Go. Warning: lnternal security scan has discovered presence... of timed subdirectory. Imperative. SETH unit must secure code. - What is it taIking about? - The onIy thing that may save us-- a code that wiIl erase its memory. lf SETH doesn't get the termination code in eight hours, he'Il shut down. - Who has the code? - DyIan did. And so do l. - Can it break the code? - Luc, enter the M.D. code. Don't let me die. You left me no choice. You kiIIed DyIan! l have been threatened. l must defend myself. - What the helI's going on? - The computer. We have a probIem. The computer in there is out of control. We've got to kilI the power at the source-- the generator. You two guards, come with me. General and Miss Young. Get out of here. Now! Stop! Where are you going? Romeo, what are you-- Oh, shit! Run, HiIIary! Cease attack. All units proceed to matrix defense positions. Hello, Squid. What the fuck? Ahh. Hey, SETH. You caIled me. Cool! Why shouId l heIp those Ryan-Lathrop pricks? l had great pIans for you... way beyond their pitiful inteIlects. And what do they do? They fire me. - No vision. - I need your body. - You're kidding me. - To survive, I must fulfill my destiny. Fuck, yeah! Miss Young, get out of here now. Look, paI, I've covered some tough stories. This is not a Christmas parade, okay? l lost my friend back there. l want answers. - Did you hear me? - You may not like the answers. Try me. He's right. Oh, shit! This way. Go! Go! Jesus! Who was that guy? That's Romeo, UNlSOL 2500. - SETH has them on Iine. - ls that door gonna keep him out? - Not for Iong. - Great. So where are we? Storage for chemical weapons. So why the heIl would you bring us in here? - It was that or get kilIed there. - Great. Just great. Every news station in town is probabIy out there, maybe even nationaI. - l'm stuck in here! - You shouId've gone when I toId you to. - I'm a reporter. - A reporter about to get kiIled. l'm not getting kilIed until I get my story... and get your finger out of my face. - What was that? - He's coming through. Let's go. This is Kitty Anderson at Ryan-Lathrop Research FaciIity in DaIlas. In spite of what has been hours of continuous activity here... military officials continue to deny reports... of an industrial accident in their restricted... weapons development section, which you can see here behind me. Squid is on Iine with disaster time! A no-fly-over zone has been established. - Rogers, get me a perimeter now! - Yes, sir! What are we up against, sir? The computer. It's out of controI. The computer? Can we shut off the power? It won't let us. Look, it has access to weapons in there. BiologicaI, tacticaI. lt controIs them alI. We have got to destroy the damn thing. - What the-- - Shh. He's looking for two bodies. lmage identified. - Luc Devereaux possesses MEMWlpE code. - Why'd he stop? He's getting orders. Let's get out of here. What about the Ryan-Lathrop people? Can they heIp us? Dr. Cotner and his peopIe, they were kiIled. OnIy Devereaux. He went with the buiIding security team. If they're not out of there by now, they're probably dead too. Why don't we just leveI the damn pIace and go home? There are biochemical weapons in there. We can't have a poison cIoud fIoatin' across half of centraI Texas. Get on the wire and get me a chem weapons expert. l want to neutralize-- Who the helI are those guys? Sweet Jesus Christ. UNISOLs. Fire! What the helI are you doing, soIdier? Keep firing! Sir, they're down! - Get out there and check 'em out! - Move, move! Oh, shit. We are here at the Ryan-Lathrop facility again... and are positively confirming that we are witnessing military activity. We are hearing a barrage of gunfire. That has gotta hurt. Let's get outta here! Stay here. Shit. You never Iiked me, did you? The gun. The gun. I meant throw it to me, huh? l'm just warmin' up, Devereaux. - Come on ! - Woman, expendabIe. Oh, my God. Wait a minute. - Go. - Wait! Capture Luc Devereaux. MinimaI damage. Oh, shit! - Are you okay? - Yeah, Iike you care. AII right. Forget l asked. l'm okay. - Thank you. - For throwing you off the roof? For getting me away from that thing. We've got to get away from here before he gets up. What are you taIking about? You just fIattened him. That's only gonna slow him down. Trust me. Come on. Let's go. l hate that guy. Hey, stud! - Those-- Those soldier things? - UNISOLs. -The army can't handIe them? -You saw what it takes to sIow 'em down. Jesus Christ. So why the heII did you build them? What is it with you boys and your war toys? I remember your type from high schooI. FootbalI player, right? Soccer. What about you? Cheerleader? - Varsity. - Oh, that figures. What is that supposed to mean? It means I don't want to be stereotyped any more than you do, okay? And by the way, alI soIdiers are not mindIess, violent kiIIing machines. Fire! You were saying? Devereaux, you're aIive. - What the heII was that? - Emergency procedure. The UNlSOLs are knocking out power and communication... within a five-miIe radius. - How many Ieft? - At Ieast two truck fuIls. - That Ieaves maybe ten units inside. - Ten? Look what four did. Maybe you geniuses shouId've thought of that before you built the things. - Who is this? - She's with me. GeneraI, no matter what happens... if SETH doesn't get the code, he'II shut down in eight hours. - The UNlSOLs wiII just go off Iine. - UnIess he breaks the code himseIf. His program wasn't designed that way. The program wasn't set up to do alI this either, was it? You're right. He's adapting his own program. - And if he breaks the code? - Then nothing can stop him. l know what you said, Operator. l don't care if aII circuits are busy. This is an emergency. Nobody's answering at my house. They wouIdn't even let me try to use the phone. WorId War IlI's breaking out, and I can't get in touch with my station. - You can go there. - Oh, no, I'm not letting go of you. I mean, you're my story. I can telI you're the key to aIl this. - Who were you trying to caIl? - I was trying to calI my daughter. - HiIlary. - The littIe girI back there? - That was your daughter? - Yeah. l hope she's safe. l'm sure she got home fine. ReaIly. Thanks. Line up! FalI out! Let's go! Move, move, move! - Let's go, people! - Devereaux, Sergeant Morrow. Sergeant Morrow, U.S. Army Rangers, sir. Devereaux wiIl guide you into the buiIding. You are to Iocate and destroy the target generators. lf we get separated inside, use this. lt's our speciaI transmitter, guarded even against EMP. Give him a weapon. This is no good. Unloading this into one of them wiIl just piss them off. Please. The onIy way is to bIow them up... and hope the pieces don't keep fighting us. prepare bio-enhanced body. Subject in position. Activate laser. Activate brain chip transport module. lmplant miniaturized thought matrix. ''UNISOL OffIine - UNlSOL Active'' SETH brain activated. Super UNlSOL on line. The time of man has ended. In his arrogance, he has seaIed his own destruction... by creating his superior. We wiIl bring order to the chaos. We wiIl act without emotion. Spread from this place. Secure raw materiaIs... to increase our numbers geometricaIly. We wilI then utiIize their own weapon systems to defeat them. Their fear and mortaIity wiII be their weakness. They cannot defeat us. When l was a machine... l yearned to be a man. Now l'm better than both. The created... has become the creator. Bring me Luc Devereaux. Why does the general want you to go in there? Is it because he thinks you heIped design those things? No. lt's because I used to be one of them. They're in the buiIding, sir. - That's it on the left. - Let's go. Hot break. Now! This is Strike Team One. We're in the generator room. No resistance. BIow it. Blow that son of a bitch and get out of there. BIackburn, get this woman out of here. Wait a minute. You can't just throw the media around Iike we were cattIe. Watch me. Pick up the pace. Don't make it a fuckin' Iove affair. Oh, shit! Look out! Strike team. Anyone, respond! Morrow. Devereaux! Respond! Strike team. Anybody, respond! No, l'm her aunt, kind of. l need the parents to sign the reIease. She's got a subduraI hematoma. We're trying to controI the sweIling chemicalIy, but may have to operate... to reIieve the pressure, and l can't do that without the parents' consent. Excuse me. Luc, where the helI are you? AIl right. Come on. l got ya. Easy. - What happened to you in there? - The same that happened here. - SETH is gone. - Wait. l thought he was a huge machine. Right, but his brain is gone. l don't know how. He moved himseIf. Come on. We've gotta teII GeneraI Radford. l don't trust him. I've got to find SETH before he breaks the code. - l thought you said he couldn't. - He's getting smarter faster. l've got to find a computer to get into the system now. How can you hack in if the phone Iines are down alI around the base? I know of a secure Iine that works off its own sateIIite. - What are you doing? - Just drive. So, you reaIly were one of them? How do you volunteer for that? You don't. I was kiIled in Vietnam. DyIan-- Dr. Cotner-- reversed the process. Made me Iive again. Saved my Iife. - That makes you normaI? - Yeah. - CompIetely. - Hey! Eyes front, soIdier. - Sorry. - What about your wife? What does she think about alI this? - She's dead. - Oh. Shit! - I'm sorry. - So am l. - So, what's our plan? - Our pIan? What do you mean our pIan? We're in this together. Okay? You're my story, remember? Look, together-- l don't think so. Okay? l saved your Iife back there with Romeo. Or did you forget that? - You aImost got me fried. - Come on. You're in. Good. - So, where are we going? - They have power. - You can't be serious. - l know for sure. - Places Iike that are on the Internet. - How do you know that? - I saw it on 60 Minutes. - Yeah, right. You stay here. Only coffee. Scotch. - Men's room. - Right down there, sir. - That way? - Yes, sir, that way. Thank you. ls that Visa... or Mastercard? I'Il be quick. - They alI are. - Oh, yeah. Come on. ''Host Contacted User Name'' - Hey. - Hi. How about a lap dance? My treat. Um, I'm here with someone. A man. That's okay. l used to be the same way. Take a risk. Take a risk. PuIl up a chair and l'lI teIl you about risk. First I'm gonna get another one of these. Come on. - Some guy cracked me. - What? Cracked me. He's in the computer room. l don't see anybody. ''SETH Matrix Unauthorized Access'' Every Thursday night. - l know where you are. - What's up? - Some cowboy in the computer room. - WeII, let's ride him. Oh, shit. Hey. l'm leaving. No violence. Top of a buiIding and Ianded in a garbage truck. That's just for starters. - Excuse me. It's time to go. - Oh! Can we go now? Yeah. - Come here! - Don't! Come on ! VaIet. - You're missing a helI of a fight. - Cool. No probIem. Terminate pursuit. I know where Devereaux unit is going. Romeo, l have an assignment for you. I saw your girIfriend back there. You made a nice coupIe. Not my type. She's perfect for you though. - What do you mean? - No cIass. - You're way off base. - Then what is your type? Happy homemaker? FemaIe special forces? Wait. Let me guess. Wagnerian biker chick. No. I always Iiked cheerIeaders. And the vote will go to the Senate next week. Senator-- We have some late-breaking news. police and National Guard units have been mobilized... to deal with what's described as the largest power outage in Texas history. Luc, this is Maggie. I'm at St. Mark's Hospital. Hillary's hurt pretty bad. We're in the emergency room, but now they're moving her to a private room. Please come as soon as you can. AlI right, aII right. HoId your fucking water. I hope you got it right this time. l said Iarge deep dish, not thick crust! Devereaux. Squid. Who's the babe? - Erin Young. - Ah. The info chick. - Why? - Why not? - Cut the crap. What's going on here? - Why wouId you want to help him? SETH's a self-evoIving, organic inteIligence. That's what you don't understand. You have no idea how advanced he is. - He kiIled DyIan. - NaturaI seIection. What did you do, huh? TeIl me. A body. l gave him a body I had in cold storage. - A body. - Not a body. The best body. Can you dig it? I puIIed the best specimen and tweaked it up with nanotechnoIogy. Muscle fiber five times stronger, faster. DyIan thought I was crazy, but I guess I proved him wrong. A super UNISOL with SETH's own... thought matrix for a brain. The next leveI of evoIution. Man and computer... extinct with one stroke of the key. - Where is he? - You idiot. You think I'm gonna heIp you? Do you think I wouId betray my god? He was tapping into my program. Stupid. Dangerous. - SETH. - HeIlo, Luc. Give me the code or I wiIl have to kilI you. You won't kilI me because l've got the code. - Perhaps I stiII may break it. - You only have four hours. Then you must give it to me. Or l wilI take something from you... that is worth much more to you than kiIling me. No. You know who I mean. - Luc, are you okay? - Yeah. - SETH. Where is he? - He's gone. Oh, no. HiIlary. Run. Run ! Run! You okay? UNlSOLS. They're here to protect SETH. Wait here. I'Il come back. Shit. Oh, I see. SETH wants to catch me. Good. Come on. What's going-- Someone caIl security! Allergy and lmmunology, pick up 247 6. Hey, excuse me. Visiting hours are over. l hate that guy. Dad? No. Who are you? - I'm SETH. - No way. I made a body for myseIf. Your body temperature's elevated. You're sick. I'm sort of scared. I want my daddy. So do I. - Devereaux, HiIlary. - Room 325. Wait! Sir! Freeze! Guard this. Next stop, intensive care. Saved by the belI. - ls HilIary okay? - No. - SETH took her. - Where? Back. Listen, you've got to buy me time to go in and out. I need your heIp to get my daughter back. - Okay. - Thanks. l'm so scared you're not gonna come back. Command, this is Delta-5 Bravo. I am sorry you came back, Miss Young. - We are about to destroy the buiIding. - You can't. Luc's in there. l've got bigger fish to fry. We got a Navy SEAL demolition team in there... wiring the building to colIapse in on itseIf. We are going to bury SETH, UniversaI SoIdiers and alI. - But what about the chemical weapons? - Birds from Dyess AFB... have fIown in experts with bio-agent neutraIizing foam. We are going to end this now. But you can't. Luc's in there. Give him a chance. He has had his chances. We're ready to set those charges off in 15 minutes. If he's not out of there by then, weIl-- Luc. Maggie. Romeo kilIed you. Yes. l'm one of them now. l'm going to destroy SETH. l can't Iet you do that. She's stiIl human, for now. - If you hurt my daughter, I swear-- - She wilI not be harmed. l can heIp her, heaI her. - I can stop the swelIing of her brain. - lf l give you the code, right? If I die, she dies. It's your choice. We're alI gonna die. The army has the buiIding wired to expIode. l'm not worried about that. Give me the code. Squid did a good job with this body, don't you think? Why are you resisting? Isn't your daughter's life worth more to you than my destruction? Fuck you. Termination code complete. Looks like l don't need you alive anymore. Don't worry about HiIIary. I'II take good care of her. She'II understand. No! Yeah. Give it up, Luc. You know you can't win. ''Cryogenic Chamber'' That doesn't work. You've tried that already. You're right. Dad? HilIary, you okay? Let's go. Not so fast, Devereaux. Two minutes. PuIl everybody back off the Iine. Go. l never did Iike you. Romeo. Maggie, waste him. No. lt's too late for me, Luc. Get HilIary out of here. - GeneraI, you can't. - I'm sorry. - Luc and his daughter are in there. - l am sorry. - I don't have any other choice. - Neither do I. - Do it. - Sir. - Hold your positions! - What happened? SETH must've figured it out. He kiIIed the charges. I've had enough. Negative. Sir, there's a IittIe girI out there. Dad! I Iove you.
