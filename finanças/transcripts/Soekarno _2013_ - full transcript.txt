COMMUNIST IS GREAT RESIDENCE OF DR. SOEJOEDI HEAD OF NATIONALIST PARTY OF CENTRAL JAVA - There are a lot of policemen outside. - What? Police? Get up quickly. Go to the kids' room. -Yes, honey. Bung Karno! Bung Gatot! Bung Karno! The police are here! Many of them, Bung! Come on, hurry! Bung Karno, hurry up! Hurry up! What's going on? Turn around! How are you, Mr. Soejoedi? You can't search my house like this without any search warrant. Where is Soekarno? I don't know. Liar! If you make this difficult, I'll arrest you, Mr. Soejoedi. Where is Soekarno? I'm here. Ir. Soekarno, in the name of the Queen, we arrest you. Take him! EAST JAVA, 1912 RESIDENCE OF RADEN SOEKEMI SOSRODIHARDJO It's been almost two months, and Kusno's fever won't go away. I'm worried, honey. What should we do? Just let him be. Be patient. Leave it to the Almighty God. For these past two months, I've been doing this ritual. Sleep under Kusno's bed. I hope that his sickness will shift to me. It's all right, come on. Let's go to sleep. Let him be. Kusno is now 11 years old. Since his health does not show any improvement... That is why this morning I would like to purify him and change his name. I have a suggestion, Mr. Soekemi. How about we change it to Bima? May God Bless him... Kusno is not a name like Bima of the Pandava Family. But there is a powerful knight that could match the Pandava Family. His name is the Great Karno. Therefore, I have given a new name for Kusno... Soekarno. Yes. I hope this new name can turn Soekarno into a powerful person. Just like the Great Karno. PALENEH ALLEY, SURABAYA 1920 RESIDENCE OF HAJI COKROAMINOTO, CHAIRMAN OF SAREKAT ISLAM Damn it! Those Dutch people act as they wish. Look at this! Take away our rice, sugarcane and wheat whenever they want. What kind of nonsense is this? And then, what's left, Cak Muso? All that is left is poverty. Until the end of the time, we will suffer. Do you understand? Become slaves in our own country. What's that? Kartosuwiryo! -Yes? Come here! I want you to go to the market to buy some sugar, coffee, and gendar. We will have some important guests from Yogyakarta and Jombang. Kyai Hasyim and Kyai Dahlan, sir? Yes, here's the money. Go now. Soekarno, are you a Marxist? Yes, and I'm a Muslim. Karl Marx and the Islam defend the lower class. Because you're from the lower class, right? They're my family, Mien. It's so nice! You're so talented! Give me back my slipper! Come on! Excuse me, Mr. Soekemi. Please, Mrs. Sahen. I told you to study, not go out like this! You use my bicycle! Kusno, are you sure that you want to propose to her? You're not even the Governor's son. Trust me. The problem is, will her father accept you? Don't call me Soekarno if I can't make the Dutch surrender. Bullshit! I'll return the suit tomorrow, okay? It will be clean... Yes, what are you doing here? Get out. You're locals! Get out! Do you realize that you're local? You are not allowed to get close to my daughter, Mien! Why? What did I do wrong, sir? You're different from us. You may wear the same clothes as the Dutch, but you're still not from our class. Get out of here! You! Come here! Take him out. Take him out! Take him out! -Papa! No! Mien! No! I can go out on my own. Mien! Soekarno! Soekarno! -Mien! No! -Get out! I love her! We are masters! Masters of our own land! The Dutch are just tenants! They are afraid of us! Why do we have to bow? Kneel? Crawl? Being a slave to those foreigners? What for? What's that? We have to stand up straight! Stand up straight to fight them! To fight those Dutch! Kusno! I heard from Kartosuwiryo, you have started to learn how to make a speech, have you? Yes, sir. That's good, Kusno. A leader has to be able to capture the people's hearts. The people, Kusno, are as mysterious as the universe. But, if you are capable of capturing their hearts, they will definitely follow you. My brothers and sisters! How long will we be in darkness? Living only to enjoy our dreams, without any efforts to make them reality! Who will respect a nation that looks like cows and buffalos? Nobody! Who? -Nobody! Nobody! Being forced to work nonstop... The flesh is being eaten... The blood is being sucked! Is that what you want? No! -You want that? No! My brothers and sisters, let's become the masters of ourselves. Long live Cokro! SPIRIT OF SAREKAT ISLAM CONDEMNED! SATAN AND COLONIALISTS LONG LIVE MARHAENISM Long live Soekarno! YOUNG INDONESIAN BULL! INP INDONESIAN NATIONAL PARTY Our land is rich. But why are we always starving? Everywhere we can see skinny bodies full of sickness. Why, brothers and sisters? We don't know! This is because the Dutch exploit our wealth without giving us our fair share. We are oppressed by the colonial system. Are you going to let it happen? No! Are you going to let it happen? No! This is the time to show them who we are. Shout! Mr. Imperialist, we are going to fight you for your behavior towards our people and our land. We have to fight! Prisoners from Yogyakarta. PRISON OF BANCEUY, BANDUNG 1929 Soekarno! Soekarno Mangkoepradja! -Get in! Get in! Soepriadi! -Get in! Any clothes that are suitable for me? I'm not a thief. Communist rebels like you are the same as thieves. I'm not a Communist. No matter, you are still a thief! Mrs. Inggit! Mrs. Inggit! RESIDENCE OF INGGIT GARNASIH, SUKARNO'S SECOND WIFE Mrs. Inggit! What is it? Your husband was arrested in Yogya. Mrs. Inggit? Take this. If you need anything, just let me know. Okay. -Thank you. This is how we support Bung Karno. SUPPORT! BUNG KARNO It's nice. I hope this is enough to help you. Okay, thank you. We will support Soekarno wholeheartedly. Excuse us! Respected judges, your court has accused us of a serious crime. What have we used to commit this great crime you accuse us of? A sword? A gun? A bomb? The only place we can fight are the buildings that we use for public meetings and public newspapers. Not weapons. And our main purpose is only to fight for justice for our brothers and sisters. People who are always being oppressed. People who earn only 60 rupiah a year? While white people get 9,000 rupiah a year! If you want to call it a rebellion, we say no! LANDRAAD BUILDING, BANDUNG 1930 We are here to plead to the people of The Hague and our respected judges, we are not guilty. But if our aspirations can be fulfilled through suffering rather than our freedom, I will voluntarily surrender my body and soul. SOEKARNO WAS SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN PRISON. THIS DECISION WAS CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL BY DUTCH AND NATIVE SCHOLARS IN PARLIAMENT. TWO YEARS LATER SOEKARNO WAS RELEASED AND RETURNED TO POLITICS. IN 1934, SOEKARNO WAS CAPTURED AND EXILED TO ENDE. AFTER FOUR YEARS IN ENDE WITH HIS WIFE AND THREE ADOPTED CHILDREN, HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO BENGKULU DUE TO MALARIA. Malaria cannot be cured right away. It could relapse if the condition of the body is unstable. You must rest a great deal. I think it is better for you to avoid any kind of hard work. Such as? -Being involved in politics. Doctor... Kusno will get worse if he's away from politics and his people, right? SOEKARNO SURRENDERS Yes, have you read this? SOEKARNO ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS FROM THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT They are slandering me. HATTA: BECAUSE OF HIS WIFE'S INFLUENCE, SOEKARNO IS DEAD AS A "MAN OF POLITICS" They can do whatever they want, Kus. I don't like Hatta and Sjahrir. Because they accused you of dominating me? They accuse you of being too soft in front of me. I don't like it when you're being accused like that. In some ways, I enjoy being dominated by you, Inggit. MUHAMMADIYAH Morning! How are you all? Before it was called Indonesia, Prince Gajah Mada called it Nusantara. Nusa means island. Antara means outside. Nusantara means the unification of islands into a big country. Sir? -Yes? Why do we have to be independent? Are we not comfortable under the Dutch government? We can go to school, our parents can work. Anyone agree? Sir? -Yes? Do you agree? No, sir. Why? If we are not independent, we won't get any freedom. We will always be ruled by the foreigners. Tati. Are you allowed to sit and eat in the Dutch restaurants? Sit together with the Dutch? When, in fact, the ingredients are from our land. What's your name? Fatmawati, sir. You are Hasan Din's daughter, right? Yes. Fatmawati's father worked in a Dutch company and was fired only because he is a member of Muhammadiyah. That's why we have to be independent. Understood? -Understood! Mother, Omi has a new friend. -Really? Her name is Fatmawati. She's nice and smart. Father, yesterday Fatma also praised you. She said you're not only smart but also handsome. Because he's Omi's father, right? If she's really smart, bring her to stay here, to be your study partner. Her family is also nice to us. What do you think, Kus? Sure. Bung Karno... We are artists from Bengkulu. Please enjoy our performance. Fatma! - Mother, Father, this is Fatma. - Fatma is here. Madam. Karim. -All is well? Bung Karno, happy to see you. How are you? -Fine, thanks. I am here with my older sister and Fatma. Fatma. - Please come and have a seat. - Yes, thank you. Firstly, sorry Mr. Hasan Din could not come. He has a meeting with the Muhammadiyah. He is busy. Yes, there are a lot of meetings lately. Bung Karno... I am Ah Tjun, a merchant. Really? How are you? -Fine, thanks. This is for you from the merchants in Bengkulu market. And this is for your wife. Inggit. -Yes? This is Ah Tjun, he has brought this gift for you. What is this gift for? We believe that you are a good leader and will bring luck to us. Thank you very much. -Thank you. Please... We have also brought food. Riwu, please help. Do you usually come here after school? Yes, I do. -It's nice here. There's no such place in Java. Wait a second! Hold on a second! Sir, in the class, you said that Europe will be invaded by the Germans. Which means the Dutch will be defeated, sir? Most likely... Read this book. The Great Pacific War by Hector Bywater. Answers to all your questions are there. And if the Dutch lose, Hitler will come to Indonesia, sir? According to this book, Japan will come. Japanese? How come, sir? Well, although it seems like there's no relation between Japan and Germany, those two countries have the same agenda. To conquer the world. Moreover, Japan has a long history of being a conqueror. Though they are short in stature, they never hesitate to end someone's life. So... Indonesia will be invaded by Japan, sir? I will soften the Japanese so that they don't invade us. So that you and the rest of the Indonesians will see the freedom of Indonesia. It's you, sir! Please, have a seat. -Thank you. It's a mess here. I am so sorry for this. -It's okay. Would you like a drink? -No, thank you. Where are your parents? They went out this morning. Are you alone? Actually, I came here just to... Please don't! Don't come in. You just sit out there, okay? One moment, please. I'll be right with you. Listen... I came here just to bring photos of the marriage of your aunt and my cousin two weeks ago. It's already done? It's nice. What's wrong? I'm confused. Confused about what? Some guy proposed to me last night. I feel so nervous. I don't really know the guy who proposed to me. So? I just want to ask you something. Do you have any suggestions about what should I do? I do have one. Fatma, right? Be honest, Kus! Let me go! Sister Omi... What kind of explanation, Kus? What explanation? Are you pleading your case with me right now? There's no need for it! Where are you going? I have to take care of this problem before I go back to Java. I consider her as my own child. Go away! Sister Omi... I heard from the radio that Japan has already defeated China. Does this mean they are coming here? Shut up, Riwu! There is something more important than Japan. Let's go, quickly! Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikum salam. Is Fatma here, madam? Fatma is in her grandmother's house. When Fatma comes home, tell her I need to talk to her. Sure, I'll let her know. IN 1940 JAPAN SIGNED THE "TRIPARTITE PACT" AGREEMENT WITH GERMANY AND ITALY JAPAN OFFICIALLY ENTERED THE "FASCIST" GROUP OPPOSING AMERICA, ENGLAND, AUSTRALIA AND THE NETHERLANDS... DECEMBER 1, 1941, EMPEROR HIROHITO ANNOUNCED WAR. AMERICAN PEARL HARBOR BASE IN HAWAII WAS DESTROYED. WORLD WAR II PEAKED IN ASIA PACIFIC. AFTER OCCUPYING CHINA, PHILIPPINES AND SINGAPORE, JAPAN CRUSHED DUTCH WARSHIPS IN THE JAVA SEA. JAPANESE TROOPS MADE IT INTO INDONESIAN TERRITORY. Bring all these documents! Burn it all! Burn all of it, sir? Yes, burn it all. Don't let the Japanese get anything they want. But this oil is worth more than a million dollars, Colonel. Just burn it! This isn't your oil. Okay, Colonel! Blow up everything! Blow up everything! Blow it all up! Burn it all to hell! Assalamu'alaikum! Wa'alaikum salam! What a coincidence, Bung. I was planning to go to your place to let you know that our friends from Muhammadiyah want you to leave Bengkulu right away. Yes -Japan has arrived in Balikpapan and western Sumatra. Where is Fatma, Mr. Hasan Din? She is at her grandmother's place with her mother until the situation is stable. I am actually on my way there. Father! I have been looking for you. The Dutch soldiers have taken Mother and Kartika with them. See you later, Mr. Hasan Din. Take care, Bung. Soekarno, hurry up! Get in the car quickly. What is this? We want to take you away! -Where? We are taking you and your family to Australia! Get in the car, hurry! To Australia? -Why? We have to take you away from the Japanese. They need a person like you. Come on, enter the car quickly! This situation is beyond my expectations. Which situation? That woman or Japan? Inggit! Don't need to pretend, I'm not stupid. Don't be afraid! Don't be scared! -Shoot! No! SEWING MEN AND WOMEN'S CLOTHES Long live Japan! HOTEL SUMATRA Are you really sure the person you saw was Soekarno? I am really sure, Doctor. I thought he was taken to Australia. At first they wanted to take him to Australia. But the Japanese were already here, and the Dutch soldiers panicked. Let's go. Good afternoon, I need to see Bung Karno. Sorry, is your father here? Yes, he's here. Wait a moment. Japan reacted quickly and systematically. Their propaganda, "Nippon Ajia no Douhou..." Asian Brother. Asian brothers are successfully capturing the people's hearts. They have also invited people from the movement and clerics to be involved in their agenda. What is their deal with Japan? To create a shadow cabinet, to fill in should there be an absence of government. What about your family? Before Japan arrived in Sumatra, my family went to Rotterdam. I hope they arrived safely. God willing. -Amen. Banzai! -You, go inside, quickly! Bung, the Japanese soldiers are here. Let me take care of it. Please go inside, Bung! You stay with Arif. You wait here. Come on! Stay here! Are you Ir. Soekarno? You can speak Indonesian? What do you want? I am with the Propaganda Division of Japan. My superior wanted to meet you. What for? We ask for your cooperation to support Dai Nippon in the Pacific War. What if I say no? You still thinking of that woman? I'll probably die tomorrow. I am facing a new giant now, who does not hesitate to kill or imprison its opponents. It's their loss if they kill you, Kus. People trust you more than the Japanese. A long time ago, the Dutch already knew that the Japanese would take advantage of me. Or... You are the one who will take advantage of them. Get some sleep, Kus. The night air will make your mind even worse. Hurry up! Help them! Forgive us! It hurts! You are responsible for this! Thank you, madam. -For Bung Karno, I am willing to give. Thank you so much. Is it enough? -More than enough. Is the rice enough? Help! Help! Help! What is it? -Help me, sir! My daughter was kidnapped, sir! By who? -The Japanese, sir. Calm down. We can't do that, it's against the law. What if I get prostitutes to go there? No! It's the same, Bung Karno. It means we are allowing adultery. That's a sin. -Yes. If not, the Japanese soldiers will take away your daughters. We'll use our weapons and fight them. -Yes. Calm down. Whatever weapons we have won't be enough to fight them. They won't hesitate to kill. Girls, our children, the elderly will be the victims. Right, Bung? Yes, that's right. Bung Karno! I will do anything for you, Bung. I have to admit, your idea is so brilliant. Mr. Soekarno, I have received a command from General Imamura in Java to take you. Where? To Java. Jakarta? That means I am being freed from my exile? The Dutch banished you. Dai Nippon has freed you. SOEKARNO AND HIS FAMILY WERE TAKEN TO JAKARTA ON JUNE 9, 1942, WITH THE BARGAS SHIP. HIS ARRIVAL WAS GREETED BY ANWAR COKROAMINOTO, SOENDORO ASMARA HADI, RATNA DJOEAMI AND MOHAMMAD HATTA. WHEN JAPAN ENTERED BATAVIA ON MARCH 5, 1942, THEY LAUNCHED PROPAGANDA 3A (JAPAN THE ASIAN LIGHT, ASIAN PROTECTOR AND ASIAN LEADER). JAPAN'S PRESENCE TRIGGERED TWO CURRENTS OF YOUTH MOVEMENT EQUALLY STRONG FROM VARIOUS CLASSES. ONE PARTY SUPPORTS, BUT THE OTHER PARTY OPPOSES. MENTENG, JAKARTA Moh. Hatta's house Are you sure you want to work with Soekarno? You know that he is impulsive, agitative, narcissistic... And he loves his people dearly. Uncle, Bung Karno is here. If you don't want to see him, the conversation with him will not be long. There is a rumor saying that the Japanese will kill the leaders in Indonesia. Those are only rumors. They are actually using the leaders for their own personal benefit. Previously with the Dutch, we could choose to be cooperative or not. But now I think the only choice is to cooperate with Japan. What if this leads to destruction? At this point, Japan might be strong, together with Germany and Italy. But neither Germany nor Italy can defeat Britain, Russia. They're Monarchs and the biggest industrial nations. Pearl Harbor was destroyed in a matter of hours. Before the Hawaii base was destroyed, America was being passive exactly like a capitalist country, opportunistic. Russia is the biggest industrial country, but they're too busy with their own national problems. And Britain? They always find allies everywhere. But Japan, Germany and Italy have the ambition to conquer the world. They are mean and will do as they please. We can ask for assurance that they won't hurt our people, Sjahrir. Nanking? What about Nanking? More than 400,000 people died. Nanking was a tragedy. China and Japan had a bad relationship in the past. That is why we should never let this happen in Indonesia. Who can assure that? I assure you. I have done this in Sumatra. -Hold on. I agree with Sjahrir. Japan will not be in Indonesia for a long time, but I also believe in Bung Karno. We should be united! To protect our people from the cruelty of the Japanese. To get the sovereignty of the people, we need the people. And the ones that are good for us, Sjahrir, are the ones that are still alive. He's great at captivating people. You think I am easily captivated? You left me no choice. We always have choices. Now, just pretend that we have agreed to divide our work. You are on the outside, me and Soekarno are inside. What do you think? What is my limit? As long as the rifle hasn't touched your head, you are free to do anything. You're not praying? I'm on my period, Mom. Here, another letter from Soekarno. GOVERNOR GENERAL'S PALACE RESIDENCE OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL IMAMURA It looks like we don't need to discuss much, as we already have the same point of view. Let's protect our individual interests. We try to win the East Asian War, while you protect the interests of Indonesian independence. How is the house that you are staying at? Comfortable? Thank you very much. EAST PEGANGSAAN, JAKARTA How's Father's relationship with Fatma, Mother? That's not my business. That's your father's. You already where I stand on this. What if the Japanese break their promise? This cooperation will get us involved in their campaign. The Dutch will take advantage to regain control over Indonesia. GUBENG RAILWAY STATION SURABAYA Long live Soekarno! Praise the Lord, thanks to Dai Nippon, I can be here with my brothers in Surabaya. Today, I am here with Hatta, working together with Dai Nippon government towards gaining the independence of Indonesia. Long live Soekarno! Long live Hatta! Soekarno and Hatta have joined the Japanese 3A. - Japanese Propaganda Organization? - That's right. Kyai Mansyur and Ki Hadjar have also joined them. We can't count on them anymore. I still believe in Hatta. We have to stay on track to make sure others won't be influenced by the Japanese propaganda. Our country should not fall into the hands of the fascists. Kempeitai! More, please? -Okay. When will you have a child? What is this? If you want to discuss the matter again, it's better not to have it! I already sure about my choice! Fat! Please, listen to me! If Bung Karno was still single, this wouldn't be a problem. But he's... -I love him, Father! Fatma! What about Mrs. Inggit? Have you asked her how she feels? Does she want to share her husband? Do you? So, what do you want me to do? We just want you to be happy! I can only be happy with Bung Karno, Father! That's it! Fat! All right. I'll talk about this with Bung Karno. Bung. We have to convince General Imamura about the programs we have lined up. This is General Harada from Battalion 16 in Java. He is replacing General Imamura. Sir, I am going to be proposed to once again by the same man who previously proposed me. But you know, I still love you. I am still waiting for you. But if you can't fulfil your promise, I will reluctantly have to accept this proposal. I hope you understand me. Regards, Fatma. We do not have a choice, Harada said that propaganda 3A isn't going well. He wants us to establish Putera. If Putera is the extension of 3A propaganda, I would rather back off. Me too, Bung. We have to take advantage of Putera to be able to take care of our people. But how would we do this? They are against us hoisting our flag and singing our national anthem in their organization. When, in fact, that's the most effective way to attract the sympathy of the youth. What do you think, Bung Karno? Yes, Bung Karno? What's wrong with him? Let me take care of him. I don't want to divorce you. I don't want to be in this situation. I imagined this a long time ago. Long before you took me from my first husband. For you, love was not enough for our marriage. You've shown me all that, everything, your sacrifices. Still not enough for you. But I sincerely accept it. I am just reluctant for you to have another wife. I hope you respect that. That's my principal. I've brought you to the gate of your dreams. DIVORCE SETTLEMENT LETTER OF DIVORCE AGREEMENT Where will you go? To Haji Anda's house in Lengkong Besar. A good friend in Bandung. Let me take you there. You don't have to. Allow me to do something for you for the last time. Letters! Thanks. Who sent it? -I don't know. The telegram is in Japanese. Please help me to read this. From Soekarno. "Fatmawati, married with representative by Officer Sarjono, "because the groom cannot come," "1st June, 1943, go to Jakarta." Dear, Fatma is getting married! With whom? With Soekarno! Are you Putera? -Yes, we are Putera! How are you? How do you do, sir? TENNO HEIKA PALACE, JAPAN Brothers and sisters, as a son of this country, I hold it as my responsibility to know the difficulties of my people. A big country is born through independence and love for the country more than anything. Without love, there will be no power. Without power, we will always depend on other people. Long live Soekarno! Bung Karno, you have to be inside. Her mother is inside. The doctor is already there. -Come in. Bung! I'm scared of blood. Yes, but Fatma needs you. Madam, come here! Push, honey. A little more. Come on, help her. Help out. A bit more. Praise Allah. It's a boy. Praise Allah! What do you name him? Guntur. Yes, Guntur. Guntur, the son of Soekarno. Guntur Soekarno Putra. Honey! You have guests from Bandung. Oh, my God! Bung! How are you? You look great! -Thank you. I almost turned my back for I saw someone I don't recognize. This is my wife, Fatma, and my son, Guntur. Finally, Bung Karno has a child! Your crying is so loud, like thunder. This is my friend, Gatot, from Banceuy Prison. He often beat me wrestling. Your feet are still strong? -Of course! Get us some drinks. -Okay. Please, have a seat. This is Wikana, my friend. I used to accompany Gatot in Jakarta. So, he is your personal secretary or what? You know, the current conditions are far different from the past. Japan entrusted the natives to hold an administration. This is something that was never done by the Netherlands. Yeah, but it means that you are called a collaborator. You sold your own nation to Japan. You accuse me like that too? I know that you always have good reasons for your decisions. I have always been troubled by young men who find fault with me. I did all this for our independence! They are still young. You were like them, too, cynical about the old people. Be assured that they will give us independence. Something that the Netherlands never did. Guntur. Thank you. You look so happy now. I can't lie to myself. I need children. What about your troops? You just changed the subject. PETA. Defender of the Motherland. The embryo of the Indonesian national army. Yeah, great. But you know the consequences. We will be branded as the minions of Japan! Damn it! What can I do for you? I want you to convince young people like Wikana and others to enroll in PETA. This is very important. -Yeah. You're smart to take people's hearts. Am I right? Anything for you, my friend. In order to achieve Indonesia's independence, we hope for your participation in the defense of the Motherland and working soldiers organizations. Your participation will help Japan to bring about Indonesia's independence. This is going too far! They arrested our people just like that without any clear legal basis! At least the Netherlands used to bother writing up the articles they could use! You have to talk to them! I will speak to Soekarno. I believe he's as angry as you are. Your actions to recruit young men for PETA and Romusha means that you are selling our youth to fascists! Your actions will be condemned. BANNER DISTRIBUTIONS TO PETA SOLDIERS JAVA One day, they will become the Indonesian army. Patriots of this nation. BIG MOUTH! COWARDS! JAPAN'S MINIONS Indonesia will always become the target! Our land is so strategic and rich! There are only two options for us. Being independent or becoming the slaves of foreigners. Where are you going? Forgive me, sir. I can't accompany you any longer. I want to say goodbye. -What's going on? You can read it in my letter. Excuse me, sir. -Wait, Riwu! TO: FATHER FROM: RIWU Since last week, he's always staring at Inggit's photo. I feel like I'm being compared to her. What's going on? FORCED-LABOR TROOPS Move! Come on, Soekarno. Act! Act as if you're working. Smiling while working. Smile. Now, move backwards. A little bit more. Kneel! Kneel down! What's wrong with all of you? Why do you act as if you're greater than the prophets, changing the qibla direction as you wish. That's such blasphemy! Kyai! There's no God but Allah. -Allahu Akbar. Don't record that! TRAITOR! MURDERER! I am sorry to keep you waiting. General Harada couldn't make it. I was told to give this to you. It's a letter from Kyoto, as a token of gratitude for helping Tenno Heika. You have been given the permission to hoist your national flag and sing your national anthem. This is for every island in Indonesia? No, only in Java. Prosperity to its soul Its nations, its people, and all INDONESIAN NATIONAL FLAG WAS HOISTED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JAPANESE OCCUPATION Vigilant may her heart be Vigilant may her mind be For a greater Indonesia Stand straight! Disperse! Praise Allah! Hopefully, this is the start of a good beginning for them. Why are you so concerned about them? This country has given us so much. It's reasonable to give them the best. Besides, we are being pressured. Please make sure Soekarno and Hatta are at my house tonight. Got it! Before Japan officially gives independence to Indonesia, RESIDENCE OF ADMIRAL MAEDA INTER-RELATIONS OFFICER OF JAPAN ARMY-NAVY you should think about the form of the state. My suggestion is to form your state as a monarchy. This form of the state will make it easy for you to cooperate with Japan. Who will be the king? You. Hatta will become the Prime Minister. Can I talk about this with Hatta? I don't agree with a monarchy. This will deny the spirit of nationalism that I built since INP and Partindo! Yes, you're right. In my opinion, Indonesia is suitable to be a federation state. Each island has autonomy to manage its own government. No. I disagree. There is no unity in one nation. Bung... This is Indonesia. As you know, it consists of many cultures, languages, customs, religions. The geographical condition of each island is different. Flores is different than Aceh. Makassar is also different than Java. So, on what basis, can we unite them into one nation? On the basis of us having the same fate as a colonized nation! Gadjah Mada sought to unite the entire archipelago. Through the oath of palapa. That is not a good reason. In the future, it will cause inequality and trigger conflicts among regions. We cannot determine this here. There must be an agency that can discuss all of this. I agree. The Japanese have lost the battle against the Philippines, Bung Karno. So... End your ties with the Japanese. Before everything is ruined. I have already formed an organization to work and prepare for Indonesia's independence. That's built by the Japanese, not our people. We have to make our own organization. -Right. Be patient, what you are doing will create more confusion. You are scared! Who started the fight first? Was sent to prison, exiled and deprived of his people? All of you go home and trust us. We will achieve this independence peacefully. Remember! I want a safe independence. Not a massacre. Too late. Supriyadi already did something with PETA in Blitar. To us, he's a hero. -That's right. Yes, that's good. Follow him. We have decided to stop supporting you, Soekarno. Go ahead. Do as you please. We shall see who will proclaim Indonesia's independence first. Let's go! I know that you are not what they claimed. I will not disappoint my people. Not even you, Fatmawati. Ducks are walking together. The falcon is flying alone. Tomorrow, I will show them who Soekarno really is. My fellow compatriots and countrymen! The majority of the population in Indonesia are Muslims! As it should be, the basis of the Indonesian State is Islamic Sharia! Islamic Sharia! Islamic Sharia! VOLKSRAAD BUILDING, JUNE 1, 1945 BPUPKI ASSEMBLY FOR STATE PRINCIPLES During the past three days, many of us have made speeches. However, no one has been able to answer the question of chairman Dr. Radjiman. What is the principle of our country? Here... Allow me to answer the chairman's question. What is the principle of our country? There are five principles. Number one... A sense of nationalism that can unite us as a nation. This nation consists of islands, cultural tribes and languages. Only a sense of nationality can unite them. A nationality that is not narrow. That is not only concerned with their own ethnicity. We'll see you again. Gandhi said, "I am a nationalist, but my nationalism is humanity." We should not embrace nationalism that secludes us. We should embrace the one that nurtures our relationship! That will be the second point. Humanity. The third point... A consensus based on representative deliberation. Any disputes caused by ethnic or cultural friction should be solved through deliberation. Fourth point... In order to alleviate poverty in our country, fortunes enjoyed only by a small group of people, while the poor remain in misery without any attention, we must provide social welfare for all Indonesian people! What is your name? -My name is Anen. Fifth point... The summary of the previous four items. Namely, to be devoted to the one and only God. Let us observe a godly Indonesia! The God of your own religions! The Muslims, according to Prophet Muhammad! The Christians, according to Jesus. The Buddhists, according to the book of Tripitaka. Therefore, let us respect each other! Believe in god in a civilized manner. I just proposed the principles of our nation. There are five points! According to our friend, who is a linguist, the name should be Pancasila! Excellent speech! You're great! Thank you. -Congratulations. Come on. Forget about them! Soekarno and Hatta are my business. Please proceed with the meeting, make sure nobody finds out. Hi, Uncle. Hi, what are you studying? Algebra. -Indonesian Language. - I have a photo, Uncle. - I'll see it tomorrow. ADMIRAL TERAUCHI'S OFFICE, JAPAN'S HIGHEST COMMANDER IN SOUTH EAST ASIA HIROSHIMA - NAGASAKI AUGUST 9 Congratulations. What for? Indonesia has been freed from the Japanese. Indonesia's independent? What do you mean by independent? Is it independence for the whole nation? Sumatra, Sulawesi, Borneo... Flores as well as New Guinea. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations, Bung! Congratulations! Congratulations! Happy Independence day, Bung. Bung... What's wrong with your lips? What's wrong, Bung? You are smiling. Happy birthday, my friend. How do you know? 12th of August, I memorized it here. Actually, I have already prepared a present, but it looks like Indonesia's independence is the best present in your entire life. Uncle, Sjahrir is outside. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bombed. Japan has been defeated. We have to refuse the independence from Japan. We have to proclaim independence by ourselves. Japan has been defeated! We have to give a good impression to the international world that we did not get our independence from Japan. Let's proclaim it quickly. I have to discuss this with Admiral Maeda first! What for? We have to make sure about it. Soekarno, we have to break away from them! - Japan is still strong here! - Japan has lost! But they can still use their weapons, Sjahrir! Enough! There is no use for us to shout out our ego! And it is not important if Japan has lost or not. What important now is if we can handle the situation so that it is not chaotic, so that there is no bloodshed. Live does not need to be defended. It does not need to be won. Coward! Come in. Bung... We have to go to Soekarno's house at once. Now, Bung. Tonight. Yes, right now. That's ridiculous! We have already thought about this carefully. We have vanguard corps, in fact, everything is ready. If you give us the order, all of Jakarta will be burnt to the ground. Thousands of armed forces will surround and destroy the Japanese army. No! Your strength is meaningless. So you are still insisting on waiting for the court's decision tomorrow? Yes, because that is the safest way. What's this? We are asking Hatta and Soekarno to proclaim the Independence of Indonesia at once. That's right, Bung. Right away! No. -Why not? Are you scared? We are not scared, but we do not want to be reckless. Fine, if you are still like this, we will... -What? Will do what? Here, my neck... Cut it off. Now! It wasn't meant for you. Guntur didn't wake up, right? What is this? Bung Sjahrir... Who has done this? Sjahrir? What happened? -They kidnapped Soekarno and Hatta. What? So, he hasn't been here since this morning? Yes, sir. THE NATIONAL PATRIOT Take care of the two leaders. Yes, sir! Avoid any bloodshed. Yes, sir! After your brutal and hasty actions, you want me to support you? I won't do that! From my actions, you can see that I am on a different page than Soekarno and Hatta. But if you want the independence of Indonesia, bring them back. But, our movement is supported by the head of PETA. Bring them back to Jakarta! One thing you ought to know, one, two or even three Sjahrirs won't be enough to replace them. Bring them back! Now! RENGASDENGKLOK, AUGUST 16, 1945 CHINESE FARMER'S HOUSE, DJIAW KIE SIONG Where are Bung Karno and Bung Hatta? What do you want? Where are they? What do you want? Do you want to shoot me? Bung Hatta... Soebardjo... What is the situation in Jakarta? Nothing, there's no revolution in Jakarta. So, we have wasted a day for no reason. The most important thing, radio said that Emperor Hirohito has given back sovereignty to the Allies. Japan is finished. Sjahrir was right. So, let's go to Jakarta as soon as possible. - We proclaim our independence. - You, shut up! Marshall Terauchi said Indonesian independence will be handed over on the 24th of August. Sorry. I have carried out everything that you asked for, helping and... -Sorry, this is beyond our expectations. Fine, if you don't want to help us, don't obstruct us from proclaiming our independence. We are forced to stop it. Why? Your government has given us independence. Dai Nippon has submitted his sovereignty to our allies. Is that the promise of a samurai? If so, Indonesia will show Dai Nippon how to be a real samurai. Stop! Don't embarrass our country. We have lost. Accept this defeat honorably. It's all in vain. Sjahrir will laugh at me. Underestimating me. No, you are wrong. You are always on his side. It is true Sjahrir doesn't like your agitative attitude. But, he never underestimates you. Behind his attitude, which might be offensive sometimes, he agrees about one thing... You can capture people's hearts. Whereas, he can't. I want to ask you one thing. What? If Indonesia is freed from the colonialists, whether it is Japan, Netherlands, Britain or even America, are you sure that you can lead a country with 70 million people? Do a fair national election, to choose the right leader? Are you sure that we can fairly manage our wealth for the people's welfare? No differences and conflicts between areas, tribes or even religions. Are you sure? -Sure! Sure, 100%! Are you sure we are capable? We might not be able to do it 100%. But doing something wrong is better than hiding behind doubts. Independence is not the final destination. Independence is only the beginning. We are the ones to start it. After that, we will trust it to our children. Yes, there might be a loser amongst them. But a good leader will always appear in an unexpected situation. If not the two of us, there must be someone else. And even if we are not good leaders, let history cleanse our names. Mr. Hatta, I will show you the promise of a samurai. Indonesia doesn't have to teach us. Please. Carry on your work, I will guarantee your safety. Please. What do you think? None of us brought the proclamation text that we once wrote. Your grammar is better than ours. You should prepare the text. Okay, buy you should write it down. Okay. Any paper? Wait a moment. Any paper? -Yes. Where is it? -I'll look for it. This is the best we can find. Yes, sir! PROCLAMATION INDONESIAN NATION INDEPENDENCE - CONCERNING HANDOVER JAKARTA, DAY 17, MONTH 8 ON BEHALF OF THE INDONESIAN NATION Honey? Oh, my God! Come in. Is your heartburn back? Oh, my God. Lie down and have a rest. Bung Sjahrir! Bung Sjahrir! Come in. Report, sir. The proclamation has been written and will be read later at 10:00. What date is it today? 16th, sorry, August 17th. Spread the news. Yes, sir! Are you coming? Yes, sir! Report, sir! People have been gathering! Are you ready, sir? Is Hatta here yet? Not yet, sir. I won't come out until Hatta is here. Let's fight! -Come on! We're having a proclamation here! Enough! Stop it! Bung Hatta! Freedom! Are you ready? I am ready. Brothers and sisters, I have asked you to gather here today to witness an important event in our history. For decades, even centuries, we Indonesians have fought for the independence of our land. Also, during the Japanese era. Our efforts to achieve national independence never stopped. During the Japanese era, it looks like we are surrendering ourselves to them. But, in reality, we are still building our own power. Now is the time, we take the fate of the nation and homeland in our own hands. Only those nations that are brave enough to take their fate into their own hands will be the strongest. Brothers and sisters, listen to our proclamation. Proclamation. VOICE OF IR. SOEKARNO RECORDED AT INDONESIAN RADIO STATION We the people of Indonesia hereby declare the independence of Indonesia. Matters which concern the transfer of power and other things will be executed by careful means and in the shortest possible time. Jakarta, August 17, 1945. On behalf of the people of Indonesia, Soekarno-Hatta. Today... I learned a lot from everything that happened. Trying to gain victory on your own is a true defeat. Independence cannot be attained in such a way. I will write this down in my heart for my children. FOR MY FATHER... Subtitle translation by: Ardi Prananta
