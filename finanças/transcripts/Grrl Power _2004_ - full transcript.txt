Umi Umi Sora Umi Sora Ao Umi Sora Ao Somewhere in the Shonan area near Kamakura, Umi Sora Ao Umi Sora Ao there were three very different girls, Umi Sora Ao who ran a handyman shop named Irukaya.

Irukaya Pardon! I came, since I heard this was a good handyman shop. I would actually like you to find a diamond ring I dropped in the sea. The ring is a memento of my youth. "No", you say? What?! Why not?! "You're pompous." "Bow tie." "Your mustaches are curled at the ends." What?! For reasons like that?! Outta the way, outta the way! Oh, wait! My diamond... Hey, why won't you do it?! I've got money! Plenty of it! Hey, come on! Hey, hey! Where are you taking that?! Hey! I'm talking to you! Hey, hey! Wait for me! I said, wait for me! Oh, Sora! Umi! Ao! You came to school! Hi! The truck that transports the school lunch broke down, so Irukaya has brought it for you today! Ah, here you are. Put it down right over there. Aye, aye, Sir! Oh, are you girls elementary school kids? Say, Ma'am, what are these? Oh, those are leftovers from yesterday. Brats these days complain that the school lunches don't taste good and won't eat it. Say, could we take these? Sure, I don't mind. They're getting tossed anyway. Wh-What are you going to do with those leftovers?! We're going to eat it. The leftovers?! Oh, but even leftovers are food. W-Well, that's true, but... What?! Hey, you're leaving?! Hey! Irukaya So, about my diamond ring... Welcome! I'm glad, you're all here. Hey, I've seen this guy somewhere before! What? Who is he? I'm Akira Kosaka, the representative of your class! Oh. Today, I'm here as your class representative! The three of you haven't attended school in a long time, have you? Come to school, Umi, Sora, Ao! School? Oh, I'd forgotten about it. Forgotten about it?! Listen to me, school isn't just a place to study academics! It's also a place to make friends and get used to living in a group where there are rules. People can't live on their own, right? Even after you go out into the real world, you become involved with various people, and live your lives helping and dealing with one another. So, I think it's important to learn about those things while we're still young. Such a model student. Such a model student. Huh? What? Huh? What? So, the class representative doesn't understand sign language. What? Anyway, come to school! Great, another stubborn character. And he's not a customer. What an annoying guy. You see, we don't have any time to be going to school. We're too busy. Would you please go home? Busy?! Is that really a good reason?! Elementary school is mandatory education! Excuse me... Elementary school is mandatory education! Excuse me... Hi, there. Welcome to Irukaya. Well, I heard that you take any job and always get it done, so... Oh, you're children? We may be children, but we still get the job done. We won't turn down any job! What?! Then what about me?! You're a different story. Why?! The truth is, my son hasn't been to school in half a year. What?! Did I spoil him too much, I wonder? What?! Please, make my son... Make my son go to school! WHAT?! The biggest job ever WHAT?! The biggest job ever in the history of WHAT?! The biggest job ever in the history of the Irukaya!! WHAT?! The biggest job ever in the history of the Irukaya!! Who are you guys? H-Hi, we're Irukaya. Get out of here, this is my room. Well, this is quite a nice room you've got. Nice PC you've got there! Did your parents buy it for you? Don't touch it! Ooh, sorry about that. Whoa, he's a geek! I think he might be introverted. I don't like him. What should we do, Ao? "First, go with a straightforward approach, " huh? I see. Okay! Come on, go to school! That's being TOO straightforward, Sora! What?! I am?! Why don't you go to school? It's boring, pointless, and a pain. You're exactly right! No! No! You shouldn't praise him, Sora! Oh, shoot! You idiot! Wh-What did you do that for?! Sora, keep going, keep going. You idiot! No, we heard that part already. What?! Listen to me, s-school isn't just a place to study academics. It's also a place to make friends and get used to living in a group where there are rules. People can't live on their own, right? Even after you go out into the real world, you become involved with various people, and live your lives helping and dealing with one another. So, I think it's important to learn about those things while we're still young. Um, that's exactly what I just said earlier... Do you guys seriously believe that? What? Is there any real education going on at schools these days? Schools only teach you exactly what's in the textbooks. Are textbooks really correct? Does the world work just like it says in the textbooks? If everyone in the world lived according to textbooks, nothing bad should ever happen in this world, right? What's up with this guy? He's suddenly started preaching. I want to live according to my ideas. I want to know how I can live, so I can be true to myself. Schools don't teach you a thing about stuff like that! You're exactly right! What? What did you say?! So, you guys run a handyman shop?! That's incredible! You get to live the way you want to, you don't have to go to school, AND you get to earn an allowance! That's great! You idiot, we've our own reasons for why we do what we do. Yes, all sorts. A handyman shop! Great! Great! Yeah, that's great! Let me join you guys! That's impossible. What?! What?! Freedom! Wonderful! WONDERFUL! This is freedom! Now, I'm free from the stupid school and from my nagging parents! Starting today, THIS will be my way of life! Irukaya Starting today, THIS will be my way of life! Irukaya Irukaya I guess he had a lot pent up in him. Wake up! Wake up, Riku! I SAID, wake up! Oh, morning. You guys get up early. We finished the gardening work already while you were taking your sweet time. Huh? Gardening? Let's go do a little work before breakfast! What? We're not having breakfast? Hey, what's this "little work"? There's a granny who lives up there and part of her daily morning routine is that I take her for a walk. What? She lives at the top of this? Quit dawdling, Riku! Say, what's with the "Riku" thing? It's your name. We've got Umi, Sora, and Ao, so you're Riku! What? That's not a very good name. Yeah, but it fits you. We walk along the Enoshima Electric Railway, take a look at the morning fair at Koshigoe Beach, and then go home. This is Granny's daily routine, okay? Remember that, Riku. If she's going for a walk, why doesn't she just walk it herself? Oh, no, I would get tired. Heavy! What's with this guy? He's nothing but talk! Pitiful! Sorry about this! D-Doing this before breakfast is rough. Really? But you're going to be doing this alone starting tomorrow. What?! Ah, welcome back, Sora! What? You came again, Mister? It looks like you guys are shorthanded inside. How many people are here? Two middle school students. Two, huh? Oh, hey, please, hurry up and do mine, too! Please help me out. Go on, Riku, you're up! What? We get them every morning. Guys who come in at the last minute because they forgot their homework. Homework? Factor these equations. Factor these equations. What? I haven't learned this stuff yet. Hurry, hurry! But there's no way for me to do this... Oh, just move it! I'll do the factoring myself! Don't be slow about it. I'll do the factoring myself! Don't be slow about it. Ao, how do I do this one? Oh, okay, thank you. Thank you! You saved us. Thank you! You saved us. Thanks for your business! Umi, what's my job after this? We've got a job from Aranami Bath to clean their chimney. Aranami Bath, huh? I'll need scrub brush suits for both Riku and me today. Vegetables... It's all stuff I hate... I'll need scrub brush suits for both Riku and me today. Vegetables... It's all stuff I hate... Okay, let's go, Riku! Here we go, Riku! Now, we have to do this 10 more times! What?! After this, today, we have to clean up the oversized trash at Mr. Kamata's place and scour the drain at Shirikaku Temple. Ao, the president of Chigasaki Bank said he wants you to write the manuscript for the morning meeting again. Okay. Riku, which one do you want to go to? Hey, I'm asking you. Huh?! What?! This guy is such a bum. And he's stupid, too. This guy is such a bum. And he's stupid, too. Don't you have any easier jobs? Then, do you want to come with me? Don't worry, don't worry! Don't worry! Woohoo! Don't worry, right?! See? Isn't this totally easy? Give it a try. Hit it big, hit it big! What?! Hit it big, hit it big! Hit it big for me! Don't worry, don't worry! Yay! He's creepy! Go home! Don't show us your ugly butt! You're a guy! What's up with that?! You're a guy! What's up with that?! What are you doing showing us your ugly butt?! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! What are you doing showing us your ugly butt?! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Go home! I guess it doesn't work after all. Go home! Irukaya Hey, Riku, go heat up the bath for us. Do you guys do this sort of thing everyday? Come on, the bath! You guys do that yourself! Hey, what are you reading? Hey! What are you read... You can't do that, Riku! When you're talking to Ao, make sure to face her properly! Oh, okay. Hey, what are you reading? Differentiation and Integration High school Math II High school math?! Economics of Interest Economics of Interest A-And you have a book on economics?! Economics of Interest "R-Research on Biogas Electricity Generation"... What are you doing? You're reading these, but do you even understand them? You idiot, we're reading them BECAUSE we don't understand. B-But why are you reading books on high school math and economics? It's for our business, of course. Business? We never know when a high school student might ask us to do their homework, right? We never know when a moron who can't pay back his loans might come to us for help, right? In our business, we have to be able to deal with all that. Because like you said, they never teach you anything at school. Like, you shouldn't become a surety liable jointly and severally, or that they make gambling so the house always profits, or just how high the moneylender's interest is, even though they exude a super goodwill image with pretty ladies and cute animals in their commercials. Nobody ever teaches you those things. Teachers always say upright things like, "You must not hurt other people," and, "All people are equal", but in this world, you can't survive unless you outmaneuver someone else. So, I wish they'd teach us about those kinds of things instead. Like even our parents. They went to school like everyone else, but in the end, they were deceived by other people and driven out by the world, eventually disappearing somewhere. Leaving us behind. Never mind that! Hurry up and heat up the bath, Newcomer! Oh, yes! Irukaya Oh, yes! Irukaya Irukaya How am I supposed to heat this? Pa-man! It's a little lukewarm. Counterstrike! Oh, he collapsed. Wake up! Let's go to the garden! Garden? What?! You guys even grow your own vegetables?! Of course! Good morning, everyone! What is this? Compost. It's dirt that'll serve as fertilizer. It stinks! Well, sure, because it's our poop to begin with. What? Right. We mix poop and leftovers with dirt and grass, and then leave it to ferment for about half a year. You okay there? Whoa! What a waste of compost! Gather it up, gather it up! I got poop dirt in my mouth! Yuck! Oh, but if you think about how it came out of cute little us, it's not dirty at all, right? I've had it! I'm quitting! I'm going home! Give me my pay for yesterday's work! What? There ain't nothing like that. Ain't... But... This isn't a part-time job for us. "We save up the money we earn." Save...? Yeah! See that island over there? We're going to buy that island. What?! What's the point of buying something like that? We're going to build an independent nation. Wha... An i-independent nation? Would you listen to yourselves?! That's so stupid! There's no way you can do that! Who says we can't? We can do it, if we have the money. There isn't a single thing in this world you can't do if you have money. "Until then, we'll keep working with spirit." Right? Th-These guys plan on doing this for the rest of their lives?! W-Well... I think... Maybe I'll go to school. Thanks for your business! Amazing! Umi, Sora, Ao, somehow, you guys are just amazing! There is a school here. Hey, Riku. We've fallen through the cracks, but you can go to school like a normal kid. You have a mom who worries about you, a great room of your own, and your parents even bought you a PC. You have a happy life. This is what makes US happy. We enjoy every day of it. So, you enjoy your life, too. Impressive! Well, I had heard the rumors, but you are truly impressive! Now, I absolutely want you to take on my job. The ring that is a memento of my youth! No way! Why not?!
