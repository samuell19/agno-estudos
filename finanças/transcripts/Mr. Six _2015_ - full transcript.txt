Easy, what you can do is come back Sir Here's your stuff I snuck him out Whatever you do, don't go next week They're just messing around Thanks Young lady If they give you shit, tell me I need to apologize to you Made things complicated Take care of yourself Please treat your Dad well Your dad is pretty amazing All that matters is he's back What're you doing, Zhang Xuejun? Let me go What are you pissed at me for? If you're so capable, go find them Let me go Let me go or I'll sue you Sue me? I'm your dad You're not my dad I never grew up with a dad like you You think I won't beat your sorry ass Hit me Hit me, come on What the hell? What's your problem? Sit down What else do you want? Aren't you happy your son's back? Shut up He's my kid, I'll handle it You're delusional What is this? Isn't that my money Why'd she bring it back? It's called stealing She stole it back I won't tell you what to do not that I even could But look at you two I'm actually scared to leave If I leave, you two would kill each other How's this Let the kid stay with me for a day I'll talk to him Bobby change into this From now on, don't talk to your dad like that He's your dad Aunti Chatterbox Tell me the truth Is he really my dad? He never cared, ever since my mom passed All he did was wander the streets everyday He never cared about my well-being Never cared? Is that why he still got you out? Even pawned me his house? No matter what, he'll live Auntie Chatterbox You try living with him Listen to him talk about that old crap everyday always bullshitting That's no bullshit, Bobby Auntie was 16, when I saw their real shit You know Scrapper? He was a kid from the military In '83, your dad and 4 or 5 guys faced off against dozens of them Got in a fight right on the skating rink Your dad took on a dozen men with one blade He couldn't be taken down Back when your dad got serious it was damn scary So all he can do is fight, Auntie Chatterbox Big deal It's not just about fighting Your dad is different from most people these days That feeling Well... I can't describe it in words Let's put it this way Bobby People have their good and bad sides lucky and unlucky times Except this time, he's running out of luck but no one ever expects it You're his son He's got no one else Who else can he ramble to? I'll live with you at home but there's one thing Don't tell me what to do Done Consider this an apology From now on let's understand each other Lower your cup Show respect Understand each other I still can't understand Tell me, what do you kids think about all day? Besides chasing money Chasing girls What else do you chase? Chase a good time Whatever makes you happy What if your happiness causes someone else's pain? Then it has nothing to do with me Today, we gotta get to the bottom of this Bobby Tell me That girl was someone else's, right? You got in trouble your group of unfaithful friends all split Did anyone care? And kids like Kris think it's okay to hit other people but won't take a hit themselves Is that fair? If people in this world don't have principles then what to be become? So what about your world with principles? Apart from fighting What else do you know? Even fights have rules and principles A bunch of hooligans like hell you had principles You kids are the real hooligans to me Does nothing from the past mean anything to you? Like what? At least a man's gotta be a man I don't care about them not that I can You're my son I can't stand your soft, sissy look When your mom was alive Don't talk about my mom Stand up What's up? You wanna hit me? Hit me Since, you're my dad Since you love using violence Since there's no one else you can hit Hit me Fine You're all grown up Hit you? I wouldn't dare How about you hit me, daddy You're the dad You ran away in '96, dad Do you know how we survived? You know mom got hit by a car in winter? She lay on the hospital floor, alone From the moment you spent those years in jail did you have any idea how I survived? You really think it wasn't a big deal? I'm asking you I'm asking you, daddy! Fine Can we not bring up to past anymore? Okay? How about I kneel down before you? Alright I'll kneel down to you Bobby Look at yourself you're over 20 Be honest with me what's your plan for the future? Your noodles Piss off I'll be honest with you I've always thought about opening a bar here Alright Sounds like a plan Show me what you got in your pockets Let's see How will you open one? Open a bar my ass Your ass? Fine What about you? After all these years just gonna keep wandering till you're old? I'm already old Bobby All I want is to see you find a nice wife and have kids Can we speak realistically? Realisticly, sure Right up ahead A bottle of beer sells for 35 at those bars Their location isn't as even as nice as ours Let's sell it at 20 We won't have couches Only long wooden benches And at the head of the table? A big-ass wooden armchair On each chair we'll drape a tiger skin on it Above the entrance we'll hang a sign Three words Hall of Brothers Kid Sound alright? That's enough Stop talking crap Come on Cheers This is a middle-aged man He was diagnosed with coronary heart disease He had a cardiac scan a few days ago We found three blocked vessels We recommended bypass surgery but he refused An hour ago, this patient was found at home with evident alcohol poisoning They found 3500mg in his body He's unconscious slow respiration Family members need to wait outside please let me through Get the cath lab Excuse me, please don't interrupt us Test ECG Get the cath lab Alright Matchstick, thanks for your help We should get the boys back sometime Have a get-together Sure Give this money to Mr. Six You already paid for everything It's no use, he won't even take it You keep it Keep me posted He's awake, I'm gonna go Was that Matchstick? ER the ward imported meds he paid it all Who took their pants off and let him show? Let it go, Mr.Six You're already like this Give it up and rest here a couple days I gotta go Zhang Xuejun Matchstick came to show that he cares That's loyalty So what's the problem? No problem Never said there's a problem Doctor, can you put it more simply? Basically there are three affected vessels the worst one is 90% affected We need to perform bypass surgery ASAP But whether we do it or not is for the family to decide We'll do it Nope Then you'll die I'll die if I do it Listen to me Western medicine just treats people like parts One part breaks, they take it apart People that are perfectly fine end up dead Whatever you do, don't listen to them It doesn't matter Once Bobby signs and they put you under you won't know a thing After that the surgeons will do whatever they need Aside from surgery, nothing else will do the trick? We do Conservative treatment Keeps you alive but won't cure you Perfect I like that Conservative treatment That's a good plan I'll be more careful take my meds we'll be fine Right? Chatterbox come here I've never begged you for anything, have I? Assume it can't be done Aren't you usually fearless? She's asking you Aren't you usually fearless? Everyone has their weakness Come here, come here. Sit down One's body is a gift from one's parents Am I right? If you said it then it's always right They take a little knife poke it around inside you without you seeing a thing Who wouldn't get numbed out? Bobby Dad is begging for a favor In this whole world you're the closest one I have I'm the closest one? Auntie Chatterbox isn't close? A woman? Zhang Xuejun what if we switched places and it was my body Would you have made me get surgery? What you just said... It's not certain We'll never know Make sure he takes his meds Avoid greasy food drink less And no smoking Absolutely no intense activity Come back for regular check ups Doctor, we'll leave it at that What the hell are you running for? Got a thing next week, don't worry about it Where are you two going? Nowhere Run, run quickly Run for what? Don't move Come back! Shit, Zhang Xuejun, this was all your idea What am I gonna tell Auntie Chatterbox later? Get back here right now! You hear me? Zhang Xuejun Hurry Why the hell are you running? Do you got wheels on your feet? You can't run forever Over here quick Quick, drive A grown-ass man, you hear "surgery" and you become a little baby? That's real brave Why do I even bother? Go to hell Aren't you afraid you'll hurt Auntie Chatterbox like this? Course I am Zhang Xuejun Zhang Xuejun Zhang Xuejun Come and see it Who did this? Bobby Remember when you tried making it talk? Stupid Couldn't learn a thing You can rob him, but don't take a life People are such dickheads Chill out Didn't lose shit You call that a robbery? Mr. Six I think that this thing isn't all that simple Maybe they're trying to trap us or something? Bobby Be honest with us Is there anything that you left us out from? Do you trust me? Forget it It's not worth it It's not the first time this stuff has happened It probably started with Bobby then it slowly became something bigger Who knows what happened in between or what got thrown in the mix We'll wait and see Whatever happens, will happen Damn son, can you stop zigzagging? Get off and I'll stop When you were a kid I had you in the front your mom in the back and I didn't zigzag Zhang Xuejun I think I've seen that guy with Kris What's he doing here? Do you remember Hua's yard? Which one? Where we used to hunt crickets Their back door opens to the bar street That's the one Once you're out, call for help No way If I go, what about you? I'll talk to them Can't avoid them forever Go, get Lampshade Excuse me Mind if I ask for directions? Save the trouble Just cut to the chase Alright then We'll keep it simple Have you brought it? Brought what? Buddy Been in a fight before? Don't move Don't move I'll ask again Where is it? Hand it over and there won't be any problems Understand? Don't cause yourself any trouble Tell me Tell me, and everything will be fine Tell me, tell me You jerks picking on an old guy Shame on you Come on Let's see it Zhang Xuejun Zhang Xuejun Where does it hurt? Go away Such a pity Zhang Xuejun Get up Watch out Bobby! He suffered a severe concussion and a minor skull fracture Will it affect the rest of his life? Simply put he has a brief loss of consciousness due to blunt force trauma Most patients can recover Of course you can't get rid of it There's always a chance of aftereffects Go Find me the people Come on! Go! Let's move Go! Go! Come on! Scrapper, no one's upstairs, nothing here Smash! Keep smashing! Scrapper The hell are you doing? Get your boys outta here What's this? Trying to cause a bloodbath?

You have something that doesn't belong to you I need you to return it Alright Tell me what it is When your son came back to you The girl gave you a bag The money Besides the money It had some letters inside She was very nervous and didn't notice There's one letter Return it and I'll forget anything ever happened If it ends up in someone else's hands you can expect what will happen Our world isn't something that you ordinary folks can even imagine Don't make things complicated I threw away the bag a long time ago Threw away? Mr. Six, it's me, Kris I never meant for things to end up like this But it's outta my control now Kris Mr. Six, I know you're a man of principles We'll pay you back for what we did to you But you gotta give them what they want You don't know how dangerous this is Mr. Six, just listen to me Put him in the room Hello?
