Hey babe, how'd it go? - It was okay. - I'm glad to hear that. - Hey, where are you going? - I'm gonna shower. Well hurry up, I'm making dinner, so... Are we gonna talk about it? What do you want me to say, Christian? You can at least try. You've never been this distant before, I... I don't know what we're doing here, honestly. Things were going so great for us. Do you wanna throw all that away? Huh? Stop, Jesus! You should know that I haven't had sex with anyone since you were gone. Is that supposed to mean anything? If we were so close, where were you this past year, huh? I don't even know you anymore, Robert. My point exactly. Robert, I missed you! - Uh-oh. - It's fine. Just so much stuff to take in. How's life, how's everything? - So much to catch up about. - I know. I'm just trying to stay focused basically. Are you still seeing that guy? I remember you were seeing someone, Josh something? John? Yeah, we broke up. That was like two years ago, Robert. Oh I'm sorry. I'm having trouble collecting thoughts. - How are you, anyway? - I've had better days. I'm sorry, Rob. How's Christian doing? - So you know him too? - Of course! You guys were great together. He did a lot for you. He left early this morning and I don't think he's coming back. And I don't even know if I'm supposed to feel bad. It's tough. I just keep recalling that night over and over. I was reckless, wasn't I? - You're starting to remember. - Just bits and pieces really. Well, don't be too hard on yourself. - It wasn't your fault. - No, I know. You went through something very traumatic. It's in the past, there's nothing you can do about it. Are you sure about that? What do you want to do about it? What can you do about it? I don't know, nothing. I guess the past is past, you're right. What an asshole! Robert! Are you going to fucking look at me? Hi. You followed me? Yeah, I thought you didn't see me. Listen, I'm sorry about the other night. Do we know each other? I'm gonna blow you until you explode in my mouth? - Okay! Okay. - So you do remember. And listen, I can be quite temperamental. - This is so embarrassing. - I can imagine! I shouldn't have indulged in that conversation, as much as enjoyed fantasizing about it. So I'm the one who should be sorry. I fantasize about it all the time! - I have to go. - Wait, hey! Let me make it up to you. Let me make you mine. All right listen what can I do, can we start over? Yeah, I'd like that. All right, why don't you come to my place tonight for dinner? For dinner? Yeah, maybe you can show me that trick. How about we hang out and allow me to prove to you how I'm not a slut. So you're not gonna do the things you said you would? You're pretty conflicted, you know that. Okay, come over. If this is going to work, we are gonna need - to make an effort. - We'll manage. One more thing. - I've met someone. - Really? Is that why you've been so quiet? That's great! You don't think it's too soon? Not at all. If anything, I just feel bad for Christian. Have you told him? Just try not getting too attached. You have a tendency to do that. Yeah it's just... It's just a date. That's good. How'd you meet? Oh my God, Robert! How am I supposed to meet guys? - You've done it yourself! - Remember what happened the last time you met someone through an app? Kate, please! This is hard enough as it is. I know. I ran into him earlier today and he seems very nice. - We're having dinner tonight. - Well... I'm happy for you. - Hey. - Hi. My name's Hugo. It's nice to meet you. I'm a hopeless romantic. - You're quite a talker. - I'd rather not say. Well the texts you sent me weren't shy at all. What happened to that guy? He stayed home for the night. I haven't been on a date in a really long time. Then I guess I got lucky. - Are you really into me? - Why would you ask that? Just curious, I guess. I'm really happy you're here. Me too, yeah. Are you gonna drink? No, thank you. Okay. You don't actually think a romantic dinner is gonna suffice for me to get down on my knees and suck you off, do you? Am I even your type or is it just because of the sexual things I wrote? Jesus, of course you're my type. You need to give yourself more credit. When you're finished here, I have a surprise for you. How the fuck are you gonna do the things you said you would when you can't even look at me? Haven't you heard? Shy guys are the best in bed. We're just two adults bathing together. There's nothing wrong with that. Your confidence is so sexy. I can't wait to kiss those lips of yours. God, those fuckin' lips. I'm so ready to have them wrapped around my cock. Shy? Am I turning you on? You wouldn't lie to me, would you? I can see your cock through the water. All right, no sex tonight. Close your eyes. Why? Just fucking close your eyes, stupid. You're a savage! I can't wait to make you mine. Fuck! And when someone's really intimidating, - you like them more, you know? - Absolutely. He's just perfect. I just, I can't believe you've not had sex yet! Really? Is that all you get from everything I said? Well I don't think I've ever stayed the night without a little play. Now that you mention it, I don't think I have either. You're even shocking yourself. Well the sexual tension between the two of you, don't get stuck in the friend zone! Well I'm not worried about that. He wants those around his. Blue balls aren't cool! You can't say stuff like that to him - unless you're having sex! - He said that, not me. - I mean... - You are drooling all over this guy already! You want him all to yourself. When did you get so greedy? Shut up! - What about Christian? - What about him? He's having a really hard time. You guys talk? - He's out of the picture. - You sure? Mm-hmm. I remember you used to brag about how good the sex was between you two. That type of chemistry's hard to find, not to mention how much he cares about you! Oh I think I've found it. Anyway, I've gotta go. Some of us have work. Thanks for breakfast. Hey, do you wanna hang out later tonight? - I can't, we have plans. - We? Two nights in a row? Tomorrow night, and we might go raw. Wow. - Bye Frank. - Have fun! Hey, yeah I just left his. Yeah, he's fine, but he's really obsessing over this new guy. yeah, he won't stop talking about him. No, this time it's different. Yeah, me too. All right, see you. - So, where were you? - What do you mean? I've been waiting for you my whole life. - I think I'm falling for you. - You're falling for me? On what, our second date? - Such a cliche. - No, stupid. I think I'm falling in love with you. Oh God, no. Are you sure you're gay? It's like you're saying the exact things a girl would like to hear from a guy but somehow, it's working. - You don't believe my word? - Why, should I? Let's go to my place and I'll show you. - What are you doing? - Undressing you. - You should stop. - I wanna make love to you. - We said we'd wait. - You said we'd wait. I didn't. Just say you want it, just fucking say it! No, please! Relax, you're not a slut, I get it. Your body's shuddering. Let it decide for itself. - No, no Hugo! - I know exactly when no means yes. Lie back now. Wait, put a rubber on. What the fuck do you think you're doing? I was just checking something. One fuck does not give you the right to go around my apartment. - What's wrong? - Out, now! Will you call me? You got what you wanted and now you're kicking me out? I just don't know what to make of it! I wouldn't either, such strange behavior. It was so unexpected but so great. I haven't felt this way in a really long time, Kate. - Ever since, you know. - Perhaps he's scared? - Is he openly gay? - I don't know. Maybe he's just not and the thought of falling in love with a guy is too much - to handle. - Maybe. I don't know much about gay dating or dating in general for that matter, - but he sounds crazy to me. - I know, I know. Do you even wanna see him again after this? Oh hon. I'm sorry. You just can't trust anyone. It's my fault for giving in. Sex makes me fall in love and I know that. He wore me out, Kate, in a really good way. And now I feel needy and I hate that feeling, I hate it! Sounds so frustrating, but look, whatever happens, you had a great time. - The sex was amazing, right? - Yeah. So as long as it was safe, what's there to lose? You played it safe, right? Yeah, I never have unprotected sex. Good, then it's okay. Let it be? Yeah. - You don't seem convinced. - Actually, that's not all. What do you mean? - What's this? - Have you seen it before? - Where did you get this? - Found it this morning. Someone slipped it through my door. Don't look at me that way! If I have something to say, I say it to your face. - I'm your friend! - I know, I'm sorry. - Are you okay, Rob? - Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't talk to Christian about this, would you? - Never. - Okay. I've been waiting for you my whole life. I'm falling in love with you! Bank of America, Jessica speaking. - How may I help you? - Yeah, hi. There seems to be some sort of problem with my trust fund. Basically I'm trying to transfer $1.5 million from my American account to my Hungarian one. Yes sir, let me pull up your details. For such large transactions, we usually need you to come into the branch, but I can check with my supervisor. Could you please look into that? I'm really trying to repurchase an apartment - that I used to own. - Yes sir. We will contact you as soon as possible. - Thank you very much. - Have a great day sir. Christian? I'm so sorry to bother you Kate. It's no bother at all, you know that. I'm really worried about him. - He hasn't even called! - Oh, Christian. I've waited for him for a year. He's the one, I know it. Do you know that we're married? What are you talking about? A few days after the secret wedding, I said something to him that made him really angry. So angry that he wanted to hurt me but instead, someone hurt him. This is such an uncomfortable position for me to be in, oh my God. Do you know something that I don't? Please, Kate, I deserve to know! I... I couldn't possibly. Please Kate, please please please please! - He's seeing someone. - What? No, no no. But he just came back! Listen, Christian, Robert was severely injured that night. I don't think he realizes what you did for him, how you took him out of that shithole, doing all that nasty business he was doing. - He's not even aware of that. - Maybe. Maybe I should remind him. It might bring his memory back. No, no. In his own time, trust me. - Hey handsome, come here. - Hi. What took you so long, are you okay? - I got lost. - Well, that's okay. The next time you're running behind, let me know and I'll call you a cab. I didn't realize I was late. Are we going somewhere? No, no I just had to see you. I'm sorry, it's only because my feelings for you are so strong. That kind of thing has never happened. Well, I'm all yours, so you should treat me with more dignity and respect. I take it day by day. Listen there's something I've been thinking about, - all day long. - What's that? Oh fuck, I'm so glad you're not just a bottom. Shut up! Every time we make love, I feel closer to you. - Is that normal? - It's a good thing. But it's scary. It feels like a drug, doesn't it? And listen, I really enjoy our time together, Robert. I feel the same way. But we've gotta be discrete about this. - Is that okay? - I can do that. Come here. Here, now listen, I have a cabin in the woods. It's nothing fancy but it's private, - romantic and secluded. - That sounds awesome. I have a few days off. Why don't you join me this weekend? All right, and we can get up close and personal. That sounds very romantic. I feel like I know you already. Just come with me, just say yes! - Oh Hugo, I don't know. - Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe in a few weeks, if things work. If things work? You were just inside me an hour ago! You know what I mean. We've known each other for a minute. This is going so fast, it's too soon! Well it certainly wasn't too soon before when you were pounding away! Every time we make love I feel closer to you. Why are you so upset all of a sudden? If there's one thing you need to know about me, it's that I hate lies. If you ever lie to me, or betray me- - That wouldn't happen, calm down! Calm down! Hey things will have consequences. I didn't lie, I like being with you. Hey. I love you, Robert. I fuckin' love you! Don't you feel the same way? Just fucking come with me, stupid. - Okay, let's fucking do it. - Good boy. I fucked Hugo the other night. It was hot. - Are you okay? - Yeah, sorry. It's just that Christian never let me. You're starting to remember? That, Kate, I'd never forget. Good, that's good I guess. I'm not sure I should say this. - Say what? - I'm living with Hugo for a weekend retreat at his cabin. - What? - He invited me. - I couldn't say no. - Do you wanna go? Yes, I can't stop thinking about it. Isn't it too soon, considering you just got back - from rehab? - Is that what this is about? Rehab? Kate, let's be real, we're adults. What am I supposed to do? I really like him! This guy is weird. How do you trust him? - I don't wanna screw up. - So you're willing to do as he pleases? You can't just go away with some random guy - who tells you he loves you! - Yes I can, and I will! You're having sex. That's not love. Are you telling me that what I feel isn't real? Are we discussing what I feel? He doesn't seem stable. You barely know him! Does that sound normal to you? So concerned all of a sudden. Where were you this past year? You're not reading the signs. I feel that you push me away the minute you meet a guy. What's the rush? I miss that feeling of inebriation, Kate. When you no longer recognize who you are because the confident version of yourself takes over. You can practically do anything. Have you ever experienced that? - I'm worried about you. - When I was in rehab, my therapist said something that I just, I can't get out of my head. You know I was adopted at 15, right? Well, I like to feel vulnerable. I like danger because it reminds me of my childhood. Which sounds so cliche, but don't be so surprised about my taste in men. I just want you to be careful. I feel like you're putting yourself in a very dangerous position. He keeps me happy and distracted, and that's better than any of my other options. I think you're making a mistake. Christian cares about you. He loves you! You should concentrate on that. You might wanna talk to your therapist. - Hi Doctor. - Oh, hi. What happened? You're not scheduled until next week are you? - It'll be a minute. - Well? - I've met someone. - And who is he? He is everything I've ever wanted. He's handsome, he's smart, and he loves me. I've been waiting for him all my life. That's wonderful, Robert. Why don't we discuss it next week? Actually, I only came here to tell you that I won't be coming again. What, you want to stop your treatment? - Mm-hmm. - Robert that's- - Don't try to rationalize things because I've already made up my mind. Not to mention, my friends have grilled me about it. So I really don't wanna hear it again. So your friends think it's not a good idea? It doesn't matter what anyone thinks! How long have you known him? Are we back there again, Robert? We've gone through this, haven't we? You've seen me a couple of times and you think you already know me? I have your reports from California. Listen, I've gone as far as I've wanted to go and I'm really good, so there's no point - in coming here again. - Robert, what are you going to do when you recover your memory? Or if you don't? You're not going to be able to handle this alone. I'll take my chances. - Hello? - Hey. Come up. What's up? - Not much, you? - Just packing. Right. God, this is awkward, I'm actually here for an intervention. - What? - Kate called. You also think I shouldn't go. - Where? With Hugo? - Yeah. I don't know, I guess it's fine. Kate and I, we had a pretty serious talk. So I'm not sure why you're here. You having drinking thoughts? She shouldn't have told you that. I feel really guilty, Robert, and shitty. - Why? - Well, we used to go out a lot. - You followed me around. - Don't go there. You know that had nothing to do with it. But still. Life is complex, Frank. I didn't have an easy childhood. And I take full responsibility for my mistakes. I just hope that... I just hope that you work it out. - And don't be mad at Kate. - God, no. - I love her, you know that. - Good. - I'm gonna use your bathroom. - Okay. - So, when are you leaving? - Today. - Already? That's sudden. - This is real. This is real. - You wanna drink? - Yeah. - So are you excited? - I am. And a little nervous, to be honest. But it's just a long weekend, so. Okay. Do you wanna leave me the address, - just in case? - It's fine. - So where is he taking you? - I don't know. - Far, I hope. - How far? Why? You think it's dangerous? No, I think it's irresponsible. He's gonna rock my world. Look, I know what it's like when you first start seeing someone. Believe me, I have my fair share of experiences. I just, I want you to be careful. Don't want you getting hurt again. I can take care of myself. I'm gonna be Frank. - No pun intended. - Right. We think you might be replacing one addiction - with another. - We? When did I become the center of the conversation? And why can't you just be happy for me? Okay, whatever. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Exactly, at least you get it. - Everything's under control. - Just call me if anything happens. Hey. - What are you doing? - Where are you going, huh? - Move! - You're not going anywhere! You won't fucking- You're leaving with some guy you just met! Can't stop thinking about sucking cocks, can you? Why do you even wanna be with me - if that's what you think? - You're gonna regret this! Do you hear me? - What do you think? - It's beautiful! The best part is we have it all to ourselves. From here on out, no more secrets. Okay. I feel like I've been here before. - Really? - Yeah. It's strangely familiar. This is amazing! This is really good. You really are a good cook. It's my pleasure. What's on your mind? - I'm glad I came. - Me too. Can I be honest about something? Of course. My friends didn't want me to come here. They thought this was a bad idea, and- - You spoke with your friends about me? Yeah. I thought you were gonna be discrete. Didn't I make that clear? Who'd you talk to? Who knows? Just a couple friends. They're good friends. I really wish you hadn't. Do you feel comfortable here, Robert? - Yeah. - Good. I pride myself on making my guests feel welcome. What, you get a lot of guys up here? I'm only kidding, it's a joke. Well it isn't funny. I liked you better when you were shy. Sorry, it's like everything I say is wrong tonight. How about trying to say the right things? Exactly how far are we from the city? - Why? - It was quite a drive. We just got here, and you're already thinking about running away? - Wow. - Run away? From what? I don't wanna be anywhere but here. Do your parents know you're here? No. You didn't even give me an address. But you would've told them if you had it? My parents live in America. We don't talk about much. And I didn't think it was necessary. Why are you asking me this? Good boy. - Was it? - Was it what? - Necessary? - I don't know. What do you think? I mean, if you were to disappear, no one would be able to find you. I could be a serial killer for all you know. There's a lake nearby. Your body would just decompose. There are no rangers up here. No one can hear you. Ha! I'm just messing with you. Little guy, you're something else. Did I really scare you? Are you sure you wanna sleep here alone? Yes. There's no WiFi here. You're gonna get bored. Listen, I'm sorry if I upset you. Are we good? Everything's perfect, stupid. Stop calling me stupid. Okay. Thanks. Stupid. And you still wonder why I'm sleeping alone? Oh, so is that your way of punishing me? - Do you like being punished? - Do you? I asked you first. Aren't you forgetting something? Good boy. Hugo? Hugo? What are you doing? Did I wake you? Are you watching porn? Go to bed. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Go to bed. What are you doing? Just wanted to make sure you were sleeping okay. You scared me! You should get some rest. - Good morning. - Morning. How was your first night? Not so good. That's too bad. What were you doing on your laptop? - It was pretty late. - Just work stuff. But I thought there was no WiFi? Oh, I don't need WiFi. What kind of work do you do? Eat your food, it's gonna get cold. Stop! Aren't you hungry? Put that away! You're in my house now. And there are rules. So next time I present it to you, you fuckin' take it. Understood? Hey, I get very possessive of things. And you should take it as a compliment. Except I'm not a thing. Isn't this great? I love being surrounded by nature. You've been so rude since we got here. What happened? Did I do something? - Always playing the victim. - So what is it? I'm not very patient, Robert. - I'm getting tired. - Tired of what? I just want you to be honest with me. My wife wouldn't appreciate me cheating on her with a liar. Your wife? Yeah - Are you fucking kidding me? - Why would I be kidding? I thought you knew! Hugo, you told me you were gay. - I never said that. - But you swore you loved me! - I do love you, stupid! - Don't call me that! How can you be so calm? I trusted you! As if that even means anything anymore! I would never, ever sleep with a married man. Why do you think the sex is so great? Because it's forbidden. And now you have values? You're making me feel like a cheap whore. I'm not making you feel anything, all right? You're my second best. That's a pretty good place to be! - You're such an asshole! - You'll thank me later. Maybe I thank your wife. - You're hurting me! - Don't you love it? Playing too rough for you? - I'm sorry, hey. - It's okay. I guess I really am not good enough for you. - I don't have a pussy. - That's not it. - And you know it. - A wife? If you cared about us you'd be willing to leave her. It's not that simple. - I love you. - I love you too. - No you don't! - Yes I do. - No you don't! - Come here. Can I join you? - Why did you come here? - Huh? Why did you agree to come here? - You asked me to. - So? I thought we could get to know each other better. - You do everything I say. - No. Are you sure? We are complete strangers, aren't we Robert? I guess you could say that. Although, I do feel like I know you. Is that so? Tell me one thing you know about me for a fact. No. I know nothing about you. Is that what you wanna hear? No, I don't wanna hear that, but it's the truth. Yeah, you know nothing about me either. See that, I wouldn't be so sure of. I know a lot about you, Robert. - I'm sure you can imagine. - What can I imagine? I'm actually quite surprised by how shy a guy you can be in person unless you're just playing me off. - What can I imagine? - With the internet nowadays, everything's accessible. - What's funny? - I don't even have Facebook. God, you're something else. Are you going to fucking look at me? Are you still upset? Okay. It's clearer to me now you just want me for sex. I love you. Everybody loves my work but nobody loves me. - What? - What? - What was that? - What was what? - What work do you do? - I don't work, do you? - Yes, I do. - What do you do? - Do we know each other? - We've known each other - for about a week? - No, you definitely remind me of someone. I just can't put my finger on it. I have an idea of where I could put my finger. Last night was fun. I'll bet your wife doesn't swallow. I could use some fresh air. - Let's go for a walk. - Okay. I've been so curious, what do you know about me? You said you know a lot, I'm curious. You don't wanna talk now? Would a normal guy agree to a getaway - with a complete stranger? - I don't know, would he? Sex doesn't make either of us trustworthy. Or is that your idea of trust? Again, I thought the idea of this was to get to know each other better. You're amazing, Robert. I don't want anyone touching you ever again. Understood? I'm all yours. Liar! What the fuck? What's with all the violence? I'm getting sick of it! Do you trust me? - You're scaring me. - Oh am I now? Yes, you are! We haven't even gotten started. - With what? - With my games. I have some fantasies I'd like to fulfill - and I think you can help. - What fantasies? I think you know. Does that make you feel uncomfortable? No it doesn't, but it just won't happen. I don't think you understand. I'm not asking. What are you gonna do if I say no? I always get my way. Haven't you noticed? I'm starting to get paranoid here. - What are you doing? - Stop pretending! I just want you to do the things from the videos. - Is that too much to ask? - What videos? What the fuck are you talking about? You're sick, you're sick. Am I, Robert? Or should I call you Colby? What? Colby? What are you talking about? Col? Colby? See I wanna do that. Just that. God. Turn it off! Turn that fucking shit off! See, that's the Robert I want! Savage! That's not me! - It sure looks like you. - I've never... That's not me! That's it. I've had enough of your shit. Be a good boy, Colby. What've you got there? A drink. Are you okay? I always told my mother I'd have a better life. With all that trust fund money, I could be anything. And yet here I am with you. - You're wasted. - Yeah. - You should be happy. - Why's that? When I'm drunk, I'm the biggest whore there is. Isn't that what you want, a whore? No, not if you're drunk. You fucked me without my consent and you won't fuck me drunk? - Talk about values, value boy. - Not happenin'. Not happening. When I'm drunk, I don't have a gag reflex. Like you're gonna pass on that. Robert. Robert! I think you're making a mistake. He cares about you! Robert! - Kate, how did you get here? - Are you okay? - Not really, he's crazy! - I told you - this was a bad idea! - I know you told me. But please, do something! You need to get me out of here! We can take his car. He won't even notice! He's crazy, he thinks I'm some porn actor or something. What do you mean? He showed me a video of a guy who looks like me. Robert, you were doing porn before that night! Christian was getting you out of it. Don't you remember? Who are you talkin' to? Back there, who are you talkin' to? - No one. - You were saying something. I don't know what you're talking about. It's cold out. Let's go inside. Come on. Sit down. - Why? - I wanna talk to you. But don't touch me. Okay. This isn't really working, is it? Not really, no. Okay. - When are we going back? - We're not going back. Not until we clear things up. - Clear what up? - Now look, let's just be honest, okay, I'll go first. I don't have a wife. I lied. Why? The moment I told you I had a wife, you became desperate to please my needs. - And you did. - You are so manipulative. Can I ask you something? Why are you lying about the porn? - Where's Christian? - Not here! Hey, I need you to focus. I need you to focus. Why? I really wanna go home. I wish things had been different. Okay. Why don't you get your things. I have to do something first and when I get back, we can go. Oh my God! I was doing porn? What did I do with my life? I'm fucking Colby Raines! You can't save me, Christian! - I love you, Robert. - Everybody loves my work but nobody loves me. I have to go. Robert? Fuck! Fuck! Robert! Fuck! Robert. It's Colby. I was looking for you. Well, I've been waiting here for you like a good boy. What are you gonna do with the video? What do you think? If you can forget my past, I'm more than willing to forget yours. What are you saying? We can get rid of that video. No one needs to know. I like that. You can forgive me? Yes. You're my dream boy. Ever since the first time I saw you. I love you, and I need you inside me now. Yeah! It's such a pity how things turned out, isn't it? I forgive you, I do. But when I saw the chloroform, I understood this was about survival. What were you planning on doing to me? Well, I'm gonna go now. Farewell, Hugo. You didn't actually believe I was gonna let you die slowly in here, did you? It would be a painful death. All the porn I did, and yet you were the greatest fuck of all. Hugo, I love you. I love you so much. Hey Hugo, did you manage to kill him this time? I really need that trust fund money. Are you there?
