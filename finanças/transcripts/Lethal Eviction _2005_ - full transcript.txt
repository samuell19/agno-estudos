[CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. He offered what? You've got to be kidding me. Just a second. Hey. I'll tell you what you can tell him. Tell him to go screw himself. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Burrows, our heat's out again. -Call the management office. -I have... for the past two weeks. Yeah, I'm back. It's not a fixer-upper. It's historic. All right. Just a second. I've got a little problem here. Hold on. Okay, I'm back. Why can't you just get me a damn offer on this building? Okay. I'm putting in some lights, you know, like you said, make it look less creepy at night. Yeah. Okay, bye. [GRUNTS] Damn it. Now I gotta fix that, too. [WOOD CREAKING] [MACHINE WHIRRING] [SCREAMS] Help! Help! Help me! Help! Ahhh! [GASPS] MAN: Careful. [ALL EXCLAIMING] [FUNKY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [GLASS BREAKING] Ah! [MOANING IN PLEASURE] Tessie. Tessie Swinton, turn down that devil music. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Is she at it again? Elsa Crothers, I've told you how many times. When she goes loca, crank you your own tunes. 'Cause that's what I do. Thank you, but the last thing I need is advice from a pervert like you. Ooh, you hate me because I'm beautiful? In my day, weirdos like you were locked up. Oh, and when was that? The Spanish Inquisition? You show some respect, you freak! [BLOWS KISS] [GASPS] -What do you want? -Do you realize how loud your music is? -Leave me alone. -Leave you alone? Listen to me, Missy. You'd better start packing because I'm going to see to it that you are out on the street. You are rude. You're inconsiderate. Why can't you be like your sister? Just look at you. [GASPS] Oh! So, you're actually identical twins? Technically, yes. But I don't think you'd have any trouble -telling us apart. -I'd would've loved to have had a twin. Scam the teachers, that whole bit. Have you ever, ever like, try to fool your parents or anything? Uh, you know, I don't really remember. They died when I was really young. Oh, I'm sorry. Geez. I'm asking too many questions. No, it's okay. Most guys just wanna talk about themselves. [EXHALES] Can I see you again? How's tomorrow night? Okay. But next time I get to ask all the questions, okay? Fair enough. Okay. Good night. What? Oh, come on. We're going out. Whoo! -Let's go, boys. -[CHUCKLES] Whoa! Hey, Sarah. -Hey, guys. -Hey. You look fine tonight, baby. Yeah, everybody looks fine after a six pack. -[ALL LAUGHING] -Hey, Bryan. you coming? I'll catch up. Okay, let's go. [CHUCKLING] So, uh, what's up, Sarah? Huh? Wanna come back to my place? -Yeah, sure. -Yeah. Just give me a sec while I get a lobotomy. Hey, come on, Sarah. We used to have a lot of fun together. That was one night. Yeah. Actually, if you remember correctly, it was two. You came back for seconds. Hey, Bryan. You better hurry up 'cause the bars close in an hour. -Come here. -Get off me. What? Suddenly you're a fucking virgin now? Huh? -Yeah, maybe. -Come here. Get off. Get off! [GROANING IN PAIN] Agh! You fucking bitch! [GROANING] Fuck! Damn it. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Go away or I'll call the cops. MAN: Okay, but then you can forget about borrowing my earrings. Come in, Hector. I thought you were Bryan. So, so, so, so so! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. So... Guess who was crowned Miss Drag Strip tonight? -You. -No. Some hoe needed a lip wax, but I was crowned Miss Runner-Up. That's great. You know, you could pretend to be a little bit more excited for me. Oh, sweetie. What's wrong? Mrs. Crothers. Apparently, she and Tess got into it tonight and she's threatening eviction again. Ah. That old bag can't evict you. Only the landlord can. And you know, he's dead. Temporary reprieve. Somebody is gonna buy this place. Oh, this dump? I seriously doubt it. -[SIREN WAILING] -So... where is your psycho-twin tonight? Is she out, sucking the blood from a chicken's neck? Shut up, Hector. [CHUCKLES] Chiquita loca. -Cut it out, Hector. -Chiquita... Tess? [SIGHS] Dios mio. She's hurt herself again. I have to find her. [SIGHS] I'll call the police. No! If you call the police, they'll commit her again. Sarah, please stay calm, okay? Every time she does this, you make yourself all crazy, and she walks in like nothing's happened. Hector, she's my sister. Fine. I'm coming with you. No. Just stay here in case she comes back. But, but... I'm in here, fucker. [CHUCKLES] You're such a joke. [GROANS] WOMAN: That's not coming in my house, Daddy. MAN: Did I say it was? WOMAN: Yes, you have it on my truck. MAN: I'm gonna take it to my house, all right? No, you're not. You're going to put it in storage because it's going to end up in my house. I'm not putting that in my house. Excuse me. Hi. Uh, I was wondering, do you know who manages this building? Actually, I do. Hi, Amanda Winters. -This is my father, Gus. -How you doing? My name is Bill Sheppard, but my friends call me Shep. Any vacancies? No, not right now, but there will be soon. So, why don't you leave me your number and I can call you when I have something available. That would be great. Um, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I would be willing to pay a premium. -Thank you. -Thank you. Nice to meet you. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Dude, she is fine. She is mine. Like you'd have a chance. Right? Who scored last night when you went home alone? 'Cause I think, I think it was me. Dude, I saw your score, okay? Fifty pounds lighter and she could box middleweight. Bring on the fatties! Hey, let me help you with that. No, it's okay. I have it. Come on. Thus is, uh, this is heavy. Yeah. And I might break a nail? Especially on a hand as beautiful as this one. You don't want to do that. Take your hands off my daughter. I'm... I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. I'm, uh, I'm Reed Matthews. Yeah, I know who you are. You're in apartment 7. -Sorry. Have we met?-No. I just bought the building. And if you don't want an eviction notice, you'll stay the hell away from my daughter. -Daddy. -What? No. I know these kind of guys. Why are you two fools still standing here? See? Now, those are gonna bethe first tenants we get rid of. We have other business to deal with. Like the old lady, living in a two bedroom, two bathroom for $300 a month? Damn rent control. No, don't worry. You know the new laws. Once we get rid of them, we can charge whatever we want. And I know how to get rid of 'em. -Yes, you do, honey. -Yes, I do. That's why I bought you this. -You bought me? -Yeah. Ah! Daddy. Yeah. Not only are you a wonderful partner, but you're a wonderful daughter. Here you go. Thank you, Daddy. You better plant some new grass. I beg your pardon? Well, look at these bald patches. You're not watering it enough. [CHUCKLES] Ma'am, I'm not the gardener. -Well, who are you? -The new owner. [SCOFFS] You're kidding. Well, I guess if you live long enough, you've seen everything. I'm late for church, but I want to talk to you about some of these tenants, and soon. Who the hell was that? Two bedroom, two bathroom for $300 a month. [GUS CHUCKLING] Sarah. [CHUCKLES] Oh, what happened? Have you been out all night? No, Mrs. Crothers. Then I assume you got my note? Yes. Can we talk about this some other time? I hate to make threats because you're such a dear, but something has to be done about your sister. -I'll talk to her. -It's too late for that. You can't expect me to pick up everything and move. I'm late for church. I'll pray for you and Tessie. Thank you. Hector? Hector? [PHONE RINGING] Hola. Hector, I thought you were going to stay here in case Tessie came back. [SIGHS] Sweetie... I stayed until 4:00 a.m., but this girl needs her beauty sleep. -[CLATTERING] -Wait, I think I hear her. -Fine, I'll be right over. -Okay. -Tess, you okay? -What do you want? I was up all night looking for you. HECTOR: Sarah? -She's back. -Ah, fabulous. -I'm going back to bed. -No, don't go. Stay a minute, please. You hurt yourself again, didn't you? I cut myself working. It's no big deal. Hector and I were worried sick about you. That freak was worried about me? Has he looked in the mirror? Who you calling a freak, bitch? Shhh! You don't even know him. TESS: And I don't want to. Sarah, I gotta go. No, don't leave. Look, baby, I am so sick of her games, okay? She is playing you. She needs my help. Sarah, you help everybody. When are you gonna start helping yourself? I'll call you later. [MACHINE WHIRRING] What's a girl gotta do to get some sleep around here? [METAL CLANKING] Hey! Who the hell are you? [BREATHLESSLY] I live here. -Who the hell are you? -I am the new landlord. -I thought a lady lived here. -A lady does! How did you get in? I didn't know if anybody was home, so I used the master key. Well, you see, my daughter's moving in downstairs and we noticed a leak, and I thought it might be coming from up here. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. My name's Gus. -Are you through here? -Oh, yeah. You, uh, you have a nice day, huh? Oh, Missy. Uh, do you have any idea what's going on in this building under your very nose? No. Well, I've only lived here a few hours, -so why don't you enlighten me? -Oh, for starters, that brown fellow upstairs, I mean, he dresses up like a harlot nearly every weekend. Wait. Does the brown fellow have a name? I don't know. Uh... Julio or... Jesus. Hector. It's Hector. And something's got to be done about the boys in number 7. I mean, they are drunk and disorderly every night. And... and then there's Tessie Swinton. She's... She's... I'm sorry. I'm not a well woman. I can't take much more of this. I'll look into it, okay? Oh, thank you. Oh, but I have to remind you, there are no pets allowed in this building. And I believe you have two dogs? I've had my babies for years. Nobody's ever had a problem with them. Yeah, well now I do. There's a no pets provision in your lease. So, I'm giving you till the end of the month to find a home for them. You listen here, Missy. You've got some nerve. I mean, you people get a few bucks -in your pocket... -That's enough. -You think you can just ride railroad -That's enough. over anybody? You've really got some... some nerve. [GASPING] Oh. Don't sneak up on me like that. Sorry about last night. It's all starting again, isn't it? I'll be good, I promise. Let's forget about last night. Why don't we rent a movie? You can pick it. I can't. Ian's picking me up in a few minutes. You saw him last night. I'm just going to dinner. We'll only be gone a couple hours. He just wants to sleep with you. That's all any guy wants. Stop it. We've only been out one time. So? You used to screw a guy in the first hour. Well, I'm not as stupid as I used to be. Yes, you are. Oh, God. Please, please, don't go. Please. I'll tell Ian you're sick. Please. Just... At least let me come with you. I can't. Oh, right. Right, I get it. You don't want a freak like me scaring off your new boyfriend. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [LOUD THRASH MUSIC PLAYING] I think Spam might be the greatest thing on this whole damn planet. I mean... I can't think of anything I'd rather eat. [COUGHING] Peeshka. I'd rather eat Peeshka. Peeshka?What the fuck are you talking about? Peeshkais the Russian word for pussy. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS AND CHOKES] -Thanks for dinner. -Yeah. Um... Can I come up? I don't think tonight's a good night. Tess is home. Well, I'd like to meet your sister. Sure, just... I have to handle things delicately. Tess can be... Jealous? -Don't flatter yourself. -[BOTH LAUGHING] You really look after Tessie, don't you? I'm the only family she's got. Oh. Must get a bit lonely for you. Um, look... my father's an alcoholic. And I know what it's like to take care of a needy relative. Um, it's not like that. Well, whatever it is, it's a lot easier if you let people help you. Sorry. God. -It's none of my business. -It's okay. -I really had fun tonight. -Yeah, me too. Me too. -I'll call you. -You better. Bye. [LAUGHING] Peeshka. I like Peeshka. Peeshka, Peeshka, Peeshka. Yeah. I remember my first beer. [BANGING ON DOOR] Jimmy, see who the fuck that is. Oh, definitely not Peeshka. Will you degenerates please turn your music down? What is it with you, huh? You're constantly on my ass. If I wanted to live with a nagging old woman, -I would've moved back home. -Bryan, don't be such a prick. Is this language really necessary? Just turn down the music. It's almost 11:00. Whatever. [MUSIC STOPS] Ah, dude, dude, you are a peeshka. You're welcome. MAN ON TV: This thing has been nothing short of prairie fire. [MAN ON TV SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Don't you worry, my darlings. If that colored girl thinks she can make me get rid of my babies, she's got another thing coming. [WHINING] [GLASS BREAKING] Oh, Sporty, what have you done? [CHUCKLES] [GASPS] Oh, my! [CHUCKLES] Oh, God. [EXCLAIMS] Oh! Oh, Elsa. Oh. Elsa, get a hold of yourself. Oh, God. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? Hello. Hello? [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. Hello? -What do you want? -[DOOR SQUEAKS] [GASPING] What are you doing here? Oh! Oh! Ahh! Oh, my God. -What happened? -Oy, it is your lucky day. Elsa Crothers finally kicked it. Heart attack. It's a shame. You've obviously never met that old bag. AMANDA: I don't think we've met. I'm Amanda Winters, the new landlord. Oh, I'm Sarah. This is Hector. -Hi. -Hey. I'm having a party Thursday night for the tenants. I'd love for you to come. Like 8:00? -Sure. -Sarah, bring your sister. -Okay? -Yeah. Excuse me. She seems nice. I love this jacket. Can I borrow it? I'm meeting a client. Hmm. You mean, some other lazy ass woman who's too fat to get herself over to the cosmetics counter? -When are you gonna get a real job? -When are you? You know, you should, like, finish college or something. You know, become a doctor or a lawyer. Get the hell out of this building. Who's going to take care of Tess? Tessie is your sister. -She's not your daughter. -I'm late. Bye. [ENGINE STARTS] You're late. [SNIFFS] Oh, papi. -This shit is pure. -Yeah, told you. How much for a couple of grams? $250. $250... But that's almost twice as much as last time. Cost of living, bro. I don't even have that much cash. Wait. I'll pay you next week. What do I look like to you, huh? A fucking bank? You already owe me $500. I'm good for it, Bryan. Look, you want a piece of the rock, hmm? It's $250 plus the five Bennies you already owe me. Bryan, please. Bryan, don't leave. Bryan! -Tess. -What are you doing here? I came to help you. By help, do you mean more electro-shock? Or enough drugs to make me a drooling catatonic? Nothing else was working. Nothing ever works. Thank God I was able to find you. Come here. Everything's gonna be all right now. -[GROANS] -[TELEPHONE RINGING] [SIGHS WEARILY] Hello. Hello Dr. Sheppard, it's Amanda Winters. We met the other day? -Did I wake you? -No, no. Well, as luck would have it, I have a vacancy. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, second floor, $1,250 a month. Are you interested? I'll take it. Great. So come by tomorrow to sign the lease. Ah, yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hello, everyone. First, I would like to welcome Dr. Bill Sheppard. He moved into the building this week. Hi, welcome. Okay, let me put all of your minds at ease. I am not going to raise the rent this year. However, I do plan on enforcing your current leases. In other words, no pets, no excessive noise, no rooftop parties. Okay, that's it. So, have a drink and enjoy. -Sweetheart. -Yes? Baby, why do you even bother with these people? Because you catch more flies with honey. -Hmm. -Nut? Dude, I'll be in her pants by the end of the week. It'll be a little crowded 'cause I'll already be there. Yo, is there anybody in this building you haven't banged yet? Her. Oh, yeah. You should definitely tap that. Get even with Sarah after dumping your ass. She didn't dump me, dickwad. Hello, Tessie. It's been a while. Do I know you? Oh, yes. Dr. Sheppard from Deerwood. I don't know a Dr. Sheppard. I think you do. So you guys think that I really couldn't nail Tessie Swinton if I wanted to? I got 100 bucks says you can't. Shit, I'd do it for $50. Jimmy, you'd have to pay your hand $50 just to touch your dick. -Fuckers. -Grow up. Dude, she's hot for you. Excuse me. Now, watch and learn. Hey, Tess. Haven't seen you in awhile. What'cha been up to? If you're looking for Sarah, she's on a date. Um, actually, I was looking for you. I thought maybe we could hang out sometime. Really? Just 'cause my sister spread 'em for you doesn't mean I will. Just calm down, okay? Don't get all crazy. -Don't call me crazy. -Geez, relax. -I'm not crazy. -Leave her alone. No, you leave me alone. You heard her, dude. Back off. -Come on, Tess. Let's get out of here. -Leave her alone. -Hey! -What part of "back off" don't you understand? Huh? Motherfucker. This ain't a bar. -Stay out of my way. -You need to get the hell out of here. Now. Move, freak! Bitch! Oh, Bryan. I need your help. Bryan, you have to help me. No, I don't. Bryan, please! I'm freaking, Bryan. Just give me a couple of days to get the money together. Motherfuckers! Fucking... [SNIFFS] Yeah. What, Tess? You don't want a piece of this, huh? You don't want this? Yeah. I'm sorry. What'd you say? What'd you say, Doc? You stay away from me. Are you talking to me? Huh? Huh? You stay out of my way. You stay out of my way. What? You want a piece of me? Huh? Huh? You want a piece of me? Huh? Argh! Ah! Argh! [CHOKING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] -[RAPID KNOCKING ON DOOR] -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is Bryan here? It's important. He's in his room. Mr. Bryan, you have a visitor. I think it's the chick you banged last week. [CHUCKLES] Go ahead, fruit loop. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Bryan. Bryan. Bryan? Dios mio! Dios mio! What the hell happened? Looks like an overdose. But we'll know for sure once we do the autopsy. -Overdose? -No! No way. No way. We found this in the bathroom. See how it's got fresh blood right there on the syringe? Here's my card. I will be in touch. There's no way he OD'd, all right? Bryan could handle his shit. Right. And I have a wife and two kids. You know what? Listen, disco queen, if I find out you had anything to do with this, I'm goin' right to the cops. You're gonna be really popular in prison. Get your hands off me, man! [BREATHING HEAVILY] All right. So, who's gonna call his parents? Yeah. His parents. [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS] -SHEP: Oh! -SARAH: Oh! SARAH: Careful. Do you need help? Uh, no. I got it. I broke a mirror while unpacking. -Seven years. -I know. Not what I need right now. Hi. You must be Sarah. -Have we met? -No, but it's nice to meet you now. Tessie never mentioned you. How do you know my sister? I was an attending physician at Deerwood. My name's Shep. I would really like to talk, but unfortunately I have to go to a funeral. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, I heard about Bryan. Is Tess going? No. She hasn't been to a funeral since our parents died. How's she been doing? She's fine. She's great, really. Uh... Sarah, would you tell Tessie that I'd like to talk with her sometime? You know. Just to make sure that everything is all right. Consider it a professional follow-up. I told you, she's fine. I'm not so sure. Well, I think I know my sister better than you. Sarah... You're not going to prevent me from talking to Tessie, are you? Doctor, she doesn't need any more reminders of that hell hole. Leave her alone. Excuse me. Hi, Amanda. Um... Reed... Oh, right. Hi. Hi. -Uh... Wow, you look great. -[CHUCKLING] Look, I'm late for a meeting. Is there something I can do for you? We lost the keys to the basement storage space. -Uh... -We need to pack up Bryan's things. Oh, sure. I can get you a key. You know, I'm really sorry about Bryan. I mean, first Mrs. Crothers and then Bryan. This building is cursed. Yeah, the funeral's this morning. Oh, you know, I was wondering, since Bryan is gone, are you guys going to stay in the apartment? I hadn't really thought about it. You know, it could be weird, so if you want to move, I completely understand. Thanks, Amanda. But moving is not going to make me forget about him. And I think this building'll be a lot better now that you're running things. You seem pretty cool. You know, maybe we could even hang out sometime and do something. [CHUCKLES] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [PRIEST] Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. The Lord bless him and keep him, the Lord give him space to shineand be gracious upon him. Amen. -SARAH: I'll see you back at the building. -Okay. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Excuse me. What are you doing here? I'm sorry to bug you guys at such a grave hour. I need to talk with you and Jimmy. Jimmy... What's up? I just got the autopsy report back. Based on the angle and location of the injection, there is just no way that Bryan could have overdosed himself. [STAMMERING] What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say it looks like maybe someone murdered him. [SCOFFS] Do you have any idea of who might've wanted to do this to your friend? I don't know. Do you? I mean, you're the detective, right? -What, are you funny? -Are you questioning us now? Wh-what are you trying to do? Do we have to do this here? This is his funeral! This case is now a homicide. I'll be in touch with the both of you. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOB CREAKING] SHEP: Hello? Is there anyone here? Your door was open. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DISTANT CHATTER] What I don't understand is that this Bryan bloke is a complete arse, but yet you go to his funeral anyway? He may be an "arse," but he's also been my neighbor for the last four years. [SIGHS] You're a mystery. And that's why you like me. [EXHALES DEEPLY] So, uh... are you going to invite me in? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. [BOTH LAUGHING] Is this typical post-funeral behavior for you? Are you complaining? [DISTANT THUD] Hold on. Are you joking? Tess, are you here? We're alone. [BOTH LAUGHING] What have we got here? Mmm-mmm. Hmm... [CHUCKLING] Relax. Let's, let's leave some things to the imagination. -[DOOR OPENS] -[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SWITCHES CLICKING] JIMMY: Let's just get this over with, all right? -Yeah. -It's going to be okay. JIMMY: I can't believe the cops think someone killed him. That's fucked up. I mean, who the hell would kill Bryan? I haven't ruled out Hector. Where the hell is our storage room? -It's like a maze down here. -I think it's over here. [BLOWING RASPBERRIES] There's a reason why I don't come down here. Yeah, this place is nice and creepy. [LOCK CLICKING] JIMMY: Oh, shit. What a mess! Let's find Bryan's stuff and get out of here. Oh, there's Bryan's trunk. -[CAN CLANGING] -JIMMY: Fuck! What the hell is all this shit? Paint thinner. Smooth move. Shut the fuck up, dude. [LIGHTS CLICK] Okay. Great. A fuse must've blown. I'm going to find the box or something. Try not to destroy anything else, all right? Yeah, hurry up, man. This paint thinner stinks. [COUGHING] Fuse box, shmooze box... If I were Amanda's box... [CHUCKLING] [SCREAMS] [OBJECTS CLATTERING] People have some weird shit. Reed, what the hell, man? How long does it take to find a fuse box? This paint thinner stinks. [GRUNTS] Yo, Reed. What the fuck you doing, man? -[LIGHTER CLICKS] -Hey. Hey, this stuff is flammable, man. JIMMY: [SCREAMING] What the fuck! Jesus! Ah! Yo, Jimmy. You're not gonna believe what I found down here. JIMMY: Reed! Jimmy! Hey, Reed. Jimmy. It's Detective Lewis. I need to speak to you guys. Are you there? Open up. [DOORKNOB CLICKING] -[GROANS] -Jimmy! Jimmy! Just hold on, all right. I'm going to go get help! Who are you? Did you do this? -[GRUNTING] -[EXTINGUISHER CLANGING] REED: Help! Help me! Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm in the basement! Help me! [REED SCREAMING] [THUDS] [LEWIS STRAINING] Hm. AMANDA: I think we're gonna have another vacancy soon. -[THUNDER RUMBLING] -I don't know... I guess I do my job well. [LAUGHING] -[KNOCK ON DOOR] -Daddy, I gotta go. Someone's at the door... -Okay. Love you, bye. -[PHONE BEEPS] -Amanda Winters? -Yes. Can I help you? Detective Fred Lewis. I'm investigating the death of Bryan Davis. Ugh. That was such a tragedy. Yeah. Especially if he was murdered. Mind if I come in? I guess that's a yes. Where were you the night that he died? I was here. I had a small party for my tenants. Do you recognize that? Yes. I've been looking for that. Where did you find that? It was in the bedroom of the deceased. What? How do you think your necklace ended up in his bedroom that night? I don't know. Maybe he stole it. You know, I had half the building in this apartment that night. Anyone could've taken it. Mind if I look around? Yes, I do, actually. I'm busy. Mmm. Well, I can go get a warrant and be back in two hours. Fine, Lieutenant. Look all you want. Thank you. [KEYPAD BEEPING] [LINE RINGING] Daddy, answer the phone. [LEWIS LAUGHING] Wow. Amazing. Gotcha. Ms. Winters, do you mind explaining why you have a vial of heart medication for Elsa Crothers? [DOOR CLOSES] Damn it! SARAH: What happened to dinner and a movie? [IAN CHUCKLING] Well, we're eating dinner, and... here's the movie. [LAUGHING] Wow. You really know how to spoil a girl. -Yeah. -[THUNDER RUMBLING] I really know... how to spoil a girl. -[BOTH LAUGHING] -Cut it out. What? Don't you like it? Yeah. Of course I do... it's just... I think I'd like what's underneath just a little better. Cut it out. Sarah. Don't you think this is getting a little old? Are you complaining? I don't know. Maybe. Then get the hell out of my bed. Why won't you let me get closer to you? -Get out. -Sarah, come on. I said, get out! This evening is over. Fine! Fine! Are you okay? -I had a fight with Ian. -Where is he? Gone. Good. Oh, look at your scars. They're your scars. I wear them for you. Just be glad I don't cut my face. [LAUGHING] Why are you doing this to us? I don't do this to us, I do it for us. What do you mean? If I didn't cut myself, I'd kill myself. And therefore, dear sister, I'd kill you. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [SNIFFLING] Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Then why are you crying? Um... I'm fine. Well, I'm a professionallistener, if you'd like to talk. Uh... No, thanks. I just... Ah... -What's wrong? -Go away. Let me help you. Actually... Maybe I could use someone to talk to. Great. I was just going to make some tea. I'll get you a cup. Thank you. Where's Tessie? SARAH: In her room. Why don't you ask her to come and join us? Because I want to talk to you first. Thank you. You're welcome. Mmm. I'd like you to stay away from Tess. Sarah, I know you love your sister and you want what's best for her. So do I. And how do you now what's best for my sister, Doctor? Well, we spent a lot of time together at Deerwood. We were making progress. But then she left before we could complete the treatment regimen. "Treatment regimen." Now that's an interesting euphemism. Why is it so hot in here? Doctor, that must be the drug taking effect. [GROANING] What are you talking about, Sarah? I'm Tess. You told Sarah you wanted to talk to me. So, here I am. [THUNDER RUMBLING] But we only have a few minutes before the saxitoxin in your tea takes full effect. Saxitoxin? [OBJECTS CLATTERING] [TESSIE LAUGHING] It's really quite a remarkable drug. Now, I'm sure you're familiar with it. It paralyzes the nervous system, yet leaves you completely conscious. Why are you doing this? I'm just returning the favor. It's the least I can do after all the experimental drugs you pumped into me. Tess, you need help. [CHUCKLING] Actually, I think you're the one who needs help right now. [STRAINING] So... Why don't you tell me what you're doing here? I don't know what you mean. I think you do. I move halfway across the country, and yet somehow you end up living across the hall. When you escaped, they fired me. Oh. So... you thought if you found me and fixed me, you'd get your job back. [SLURRING] I want to help you. [CLATTERING] Really? Or did you just want to play some more of those extracurricular games we played while I was too drugged to even know my name? Where's Sarah? Sarah's gone. I decide when Sarah comes and when she goes. Sarah. Sarah. Everybody always wants Sarah. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] IAN : Sarah, please let me in. See what I mean? [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Don't move. IAN: Sarah, it's Ian. I'm sorry about tonight. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Sarah they want, Sarah they'll get. -Hi. Can I come in? -No. Tessie's sleeping. Oh, listen... I just want to say I'm sorry I said what I did. I just, um... I just, um... I didn't want to, you know, ruin things with you. I feel like... you're the most genuine girl that I've ever met. And I don't want to ruin things. Are you okay? Yeah, I just... I have a really nasty headache. That's not exactly what a bloke likes to hear right about now. I should lay down. Well, okay. I could join you. No, really. My head is pounding.I'm just going to go to bed. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Sure. Did you miss me? You say you want to help me? Look what your help has done to me! Can you see it? I'm going to help you! Sarah has the best taste. If you like that Martha Stewart sort of thing. What am I going to do with you, Dr. Sheppard? I can't really have you following me around the country like some lost puppy, can I? TESSIE: Mmm-hmm. You're right. You're absolutely right. I feel much better about this. And with that, I think our time is up. It has been really nice talking to you. But, um, I have a lot of work to do, so. Drowning is such a peaceful death. You really don't deserve it. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] -Sarah. -Hi, Amanda. -I need to talk to you. -What is it? Someone is setting me up. They're making it seem like I had something to do with the deaths in this building. -[SCOFFS] That's ridiculous. -Yeah. Have you seen anyone acting suspiciously? Honestly, no. What about your sister? Do you think she's behind this? How dare you accuse Tess! You've got a lot of nerve accusing my sister... I'm being accused, and I didn't do it. I hear the laughs. I hear the whispers. I see how people look at me. You? [SIGHS] I mean Tess. I'm sorry I'm so upset, but people can be really cruel to her. So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go to bed. No, Sarah, wait a second. I just want to ask you a question. Bitch. [SIGHS] Oh, great! God! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Shep? Open the door. It's Amanda! AMANDA: Shep! Ugh! If he went out and left the water running, I will kill him. You really shouldn't be making those kinds of threats, Ms. Winters. Look, I've had enough harassment for one day. Well, too bad, because I'm about ready to read you your rights. Listen, I'll tell you everything I know, if you can just help me get into this tenant's apartment I think he's in trouble. Police! Open up. Open the door. Stand back. Stand back. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [GASPS] -Is he dead? -He's barely got a pulse. This water shorted the wiring. I can't see a damn thing. I'll get a flashlight. Hey, don't go too far this time. [GRUNTS] I couldn't find a flashlight... Oh, my God! -Hi, Amanda. -[GASPS] Sarah! You did this? Are you insane? Well, I'm not Sarah. I'm Tess. And, no, I'm not insane. [LAUGHS ERRATICALLY] Oh, Amanda, I really can't thank you enough. I couldn't have done this without you. Crothers was going to have me evicted. And then Bryan, Bryan fucked Sarah when I wasn't watching, and he thought he could just keep coming back for seconds. Oh, and I also got rid of Reed and Jimmy, so it would look like you were clearing out their apartment. And then there's Shep, but that's a really long story and I just don't have time. -Wait... Wait... -HECTOR: Oye. Hector! [SCREAMING] I didn't know you were having a party in here. -Sarah? -No, Hector, it's not Sarah, it's Tess. -Of course I'm Sarah. -AMANDA: No... -TESSIE: She's framing me. -No. -Are you sure? -She killed everybody. -She's lying! -I walked in on her latest killing spree. -Don't listen to her, Hector. -She's crazy. Call the police, call the police. -I'm not crazy! -Yes, you are, Sarah, you're crazy. -You're insane. -Shut up! -You're out of your goddamned mind! -Shut up. Shut up! Sarah, what's going on? We have to catch her. Go! Go! TESSIE: Where did she go? [BOTH PANTING] -Why is Amanda doing this? -She's killing all the rent-controlled tenants. But Shep just moved in. And that cop? They figured it out. She had to get rid of them. Let's go! Oh, my God! Come on, let's go. Help me! AMANDA: Help! Help me! Help! Amanda? Mandy. [BANGING] [SHRIEKING] Come on! AMANDA: Oh, my God! [AMANDA BREATHING HEAVILY] HECTOR: Oh, my God! Sarah, what do we do? We have to call the cops! It's not Sarah! Listen to me. It's Tess! It's not Sarah! Please, listen, would Sarah kill all of these people? Sarah? Are you okay? Sarah! Have you ever actually seen Sarah and Tess together? -Of course I... -No. Oh, Hector. You stupid freak. What have you done with Sarah? She doesn't exist! And soon, you won't either. SHEP: Tess! Put down the knife. -How did you... -Right drug, wrong dosage. You bastard! If you put down the knife, I promise I won't hurt you. Don't make promises you can't keep. -Where's Sarah? -Sarah's gone. No, she's not. She's the one who protects you. She'll know what to do. Drop the knife. [GUN COCKING] [CLANGING] Good. [CRYING] Shep. Come here. [CRYING] Oh, my God! You! Sarah? Sarah! TESSIE: Ian, Ian... Sarah, what's wrong? -Ian... -What have they done to you? Get out of the way. Get out of the way. I don't know who you are. But we're getting the fuck out of here. Get out of the way. Put the fucking gun down. She's got a knife! [GUN FIRING] HECTOR: Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Look at me! Somebody help! Somebody, somebody, please help! IAN: Please, somebody, call an ambulance! Somebody, help! HECTOR: Amanda. Hector. -Hey. -Hi. You're the last person I expected to see here. Well, I had to come. How are you? I miss Sarah. She was my best friend. How about you? Well, I'm selling the building. Getting out of real estate. Um, you know, see where I go. I don't know. You know, I never did get a chance to thank you for saving my life. Thank you. Sarah? Sarah! I'm sorry. I just... I'm sorry. Sorry, who are you? I'm Beth. I'm Tessie's sister. It can't... You... Tessie's sister doesn't exist. Tessie's sister died when Tess did. Did you know her? I thought I did. We haven't talked in about ten years. She cut off all contact. So she really had a twin sister. We were really close... until my parents died, and then she just... lost it. I just wish I'd known how bad it had gotten. Do you think I could get your number? I'd love to get to know more about my sister. Yeah, please. Um... I'd love to know more about her, too. I'll call you soon, okay? He seems nice. Why? Because he's got a stupid British accent? Why are you so mean? Well, somebody has gotta be. We can't all go through life like Girl Scouts. Shut up. Shut up.
