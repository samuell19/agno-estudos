Apache War Smoke 1952 Maria! -Maria! -Weight, my dear. Are you sure your husband is in Santa Fe? Yes. Who will be. Count to three, turn and serve. -It was good, wasn't it, Peso? -No, Juanito, you pointed to the head. And that is an oversight. There are two things I hate, a careless man and a careful woman. For Peso, the head is fine, look. But the belly is easier, look. Well, huh? Remember what I told you, why sheriffs in New Mexico they have small heads, but they have big bellies. -Weight. -What, Suzy? Why don't you pay attention, Suzy? What do you want? Weight, look. I saw it first. Here, little Suzy. Maria, take care of this little one. She has good eyes for business. Remember, Juanito. Small heads, big bellies. Always aim for the big things and you will grow and be like me. -Are you going already, Peso? -Just for a while, Suzy. But I'll tell you this, when I get back, you will open gifts for a week, goodbye, little one. Goodbye, Juanito. Maria. Go with God. -Do we need to go so fast? -Yes my dear, -because of the attacks. -You must make this trip -constantly, Mr. Snowden. -Whenever we transport something important. Are we carrying something important? I believe this is a secret, madam. A safe full of gold is a difficult secret to keep, Cyril. I told you that when they loaded. That attracts trouble, doesn't it, Major? I am not concerned with gold, Miss. Sayburn. It is with the smoke signals from the Apaches. Believe me, Major, I know this land well, there is no reason to worry. If that's your opinion, sir, you don't know this land. Looking forward to seeing your father? Where are they going? -Fort Clayton. -To live there? This is a strange place to live, isn't it? Not for me, I've lived in army posts my whole life. -With all the soldiers there? -My father is a soldier. -I like them. -I know, I mean... He meant to break your heart to see her go, didn't he, Duke? That's right, Miss. Nancy, he hasn't talked about anything since he arrived. We can hardly sleep. That's true, isn't it, son? -Not the way you're talking. -How then? Well, I just said that someone should take care of her. -Of course, like a father. - Is that so, son? -Yes, that's all I said. -Thanks, Luis. I thank you if you go, Luis, your mother is waiting for the water. -Good Morning. -Good Morning. All right, guys, get up, the Apaches are already up. -You look like the boss. - That's how it will be, Duke. Due diligence is coming and I am the best security on the line. Let's go. The people tell Tom and he tells us. It is in these times that I don't like to be the last link in the chain. We are more to the missing links. -What does this sign mean? -Problem. -What kind of problem? - With Apaches, there's only one. How long will the stage stay here? We just know that she will have to stay for a while. I do not care about it. -Well, at last. -At last what? That you took a good look at me, I've been here for two weeks -and this is the first time. -You say what you think. My military training. They're coming. The Apaches transformed this station into a hotel and I am the one who suffers. How many meals do I have to prepare? What you mean? Nobody survives their meals. You're still alive, fat. -Hello, Jeb. -Hello, Joe. It was difficult, but we did it, guys. -What do you think? -It seems that the Apaches are serious. -Herrera? -Yes sir. I'm Snowden from the state office. I will introduce you to our passengers, Webson. How are you? MS. Sayburn. Tom Herrera, he is in charge. And Major Dekker, he's on his way to Fort Clayton. - This is my dad, Tom. - Nice to meet you, Major. Thanks for looking after Nancy, sorry for being late. I hope she didn't give you any trouble. Not at all, we barely realized that she was here. -Truth. -Congratulations, Mr. Herrera. -For what? -My daughter usually hunts them. -You don't look hurt. -I know how to protect myself. I'm sorry, but you will be a little late. The rooms are ready and I think they will be comfortable. You will move on as soon as you can. Mother, show the place to the guests. Okay, come on. Duke, take care of the horses. Amber, take care of the gate -and check for ammo. -Of course, Tom. -Ed, take care of the safe. -Herrera. We are carrying something very important and it is my job make it arrive on time, what is the reason for this delay? You are blind? Nothing moves until they are done. -How long will it take? - I can't say. -What we do? -We wait. I have the rule not to interfere when I'm at a station, but I advise you not to tell passengers more than necessary. There is no reason to frighten them, moreover, this reflects on the company. All neat, isn't it? As these men always -Do the most beautiful women mess up? -I have no idea. What do you think, Tom? Will we have problems? I don't know, Ed. Eat after you're done. Herrera, I decided to ride to Fort Clayton. -I don't advise you to do that, Major. -But you will give me a horse -even so. -No, sir, I'm sorry. I told you, dad. This man can be tiring. I am concerned, Herrera, to twelve people at this station including my daughter, with luck I will arrive at Fort Clayton at nightfall. If the Apaches decide to attack, a cavalry will come in handy. -Do you prepare a horse for me? - You better surrender, Tom. We Dekkers have a way of getting what we want. -All right, Major. -Thanks. Good luck, you're going to need it. Do you want me to unpack for you? Just take your clothes off the suitcase if you can. It's ok. Hell, wherever do I put these? Leave them in there, dear. Why are these revolvers so big? -They belonged to my husband. -He died? -Yes, many years ago. -Do you know how to shoot them? No, they have been of great comfort to me. Keep them, please, dear. I finish undoing the Maya. Okay, if you need anything, just call me. -Thanks. -See you later. In between. You called me? Hello Tom. You don't look very happy to see me. Not? What did you expect? I don't know what to expect. But I hoped forgotten and forgiven me. That sounds easy. Do not hold a grudge. You got what you wanted, you better forget. No, Tom, I wanted you. I didn't know until I left. Who left? It was not me. That was a mistake. Tell that to Mr. Snowden, he is a company officer. -Tom, it's not what you think. -That's what I said last time. What happened to Elliott? Did he run out of money? I think so. Careful, there it is. Put it there. It is. Mr. Herrera, I wanted to see you. -What do you want, Mr. Snowden? -Before I left the office I studied your history, I know more about you than you think. -I know a little about you too. -I always say, don't show me the man, show me the history of the man. It is not difficult to see a long career for you in this company. -I try to do my job. -Of course, now I would like the key to this room, if you don't mind. -I care, Mr. Snowden. -Look here, Herrera, I am responsible for transportation and I intend to fulfill this responsibility. -The keys, please. -I'm responsible for everything inside this station. I'm sorry, Mr. Snowden. -Do you want something more? -Tone. You have a visitor. License. Tom, Peso is out there. Keep this to me, Les. I'll get it when I get back. -Well, who knew. -The people with a safe and the Weight appears. What is happening? Who is Peso? Well, it can be said that he is the most beloved man in the Southeast. If there was a law in this territory, he is the first to be arrested. And he is Tom Herrera's father. Don't mind taking the saddle off, Peso. Hello Tom. Stay where you are. You don't need your weapons. It's just your father. You still have information about the shipments, don't you? Poor daddy. Loading money, I mean? You only have time to water your horse and get out of here. This is not respectful, boy. I heard that this season was your pride. Security and refuge for all who arrive. Isn't that what I read in the company's ads? That's what you read. I just came here to get out of the Apache path. I didn't know you would expel me. Security and refuge for all. It's not what it looks like. Good... All right, Peso. You can stay. - Thank you, Tom. - But I'll keep your weapons. There is no reason for that, boy. I would be cold without my weapons. I might even catch a cold. Hand them over. I give you my word of honor. Okay, well, I have your weapons too. I hate to say that, but I feel like you don't trust me. You will get them back. When to leave. Herrera, will this man stay here with the shipment? -That's right. -I want to remind you that when i go back to the office i will have to write a report. Security and refuge for those arriving. This is my slogan, he brought twice as much business. My friend, from one businessman to another, I'll tell you the slogan that brought me twice as much business. "Don't shoot until you know how much it is worth." -You will not enter? -I have work to do. -Your station serves a good dinner. -I'll tell the cook you liked it. -I liked your father. -And you should, he's your type. What do you want me to do, Tom? Say please, listen to me, please forgive me, please give me another chance. If you want me to crawl and beg, believe me I will. You really are down, aren't you? -Yes I am. -And Snowden? We met in Oklahoma City, he was coming due diligence to the west. And you took a ride. Look, Lorraine, show me how you are, be honest. -Be honest? -Yes. I live for the lie, not the truth. But I will try. I told you I left Elliott, I didn't. He left me, but he didn't break my heart because I never loved him. You lied very well showing that you loved him. You wanted the truth so listen, don't answer me. It's fair. I came to see you again. Why did I expect to make him fall in love with me. -What if I fall in love? -Then I can stop running. I could finally stop running and stay here with you. On here? Live here in the middle of nowhere? No, you will soon be climbing the walls. If you want me, I will try to live here. It may not work, but I will try as I have never tried before. You want me? -Hi. -Weight. I was watching you during dinner. I always liked to look at a beautiful girl. -Thanks. -Do you need something? What's the problem? You are sick? No, jealous. How do you fight a woman like her? In the same way that you fight any other fight. Choose your position, keep the wind at your back and shoot to kill. Choose your position, keep the wind at your back and shoot to kill. - I'll remember that. -It's all right. Thanks. Are you sure you don't want company, Tom? No, I will vote quickly. -Coffee for everyone. -Thanks, this is very kind. This is horrible, sitting here worrying, listening those apaches in the wind. What do you think of that, Mr. Peso? Apaches are not cruel people, lady. -They don't fight without reason. -You seem to know the Indians well. I know. I rode with them a lot, huh, Mother? I think so, with them and theirs. Isn't it, Peso? So you know Apaches? Of course I know. A little while ago they they had a party in my honor. Fire water, courtesy of Peso. -But this is illegal, isn't it? -No, this is a federal offense for the white man. But that night, I was pure Apache. How exciting. Forgive me, ma'am, are you sure we haven't met before? No, as I said at dinner, it is very unlikely. But it is an exciting thought. I always remember what is worth remembering. Do you know what the Apaches want, Peso? Who knows? But the story I was telling, fire water and everything, I don't remember very well, except that they gave it to me. Beautiful, huh? -Beautiful. -Did you like it? -Yes. - I'll give it to you. -No, weight. -He wouldn't look good on me. -I couldn't accept it. -Of course you can, my dear. You don't want to offend Mr. Peso, do you? I take offense easily. -Your kindness. - It sure is. This is a valuable stone. I don't understand why anyone would give it. That's my way, sir. I am very generous. I was thinking about the Apaches doing that. What kind of thinking is that? -I asked you a question. -No, please, gentlemen. Forget it, it's not important. - I don't like music. -That's all I need to know. Get ready, he's coming! Close the gate, Ed. Keep an eye out, Duke. Thank you very much, friend. I've never seen anyone ride like that. It's my stallion. -You are hurt? -Not. At least I don't think so. But I don't know how they missed me. You are a difficult man to kill, Scott. -They sure tried. -Want to come in? No, I will stay here for a while. Luis, tell the women that there is no danger. -Yes sir. -I wish that was true, Tom. -What happened, Pike? - It's not a local tribe, Tom. They are all Apaches and the Gerônimo. And this station is in the middle. -Won't they move on? -Not until they kill him. -Who are they after? -A white man. A man? All this confusion over a man? It seems that this man deceived them, drunk them. Before escaping, he cut the throat of some Indians. Hello, Peso. Hello, Pike. It's been a long time. Not long enough. Yes. Herrera, what's going on here? I don't have time for you, Mr. Snowden, I have a safe full of gold and a dozen Apaches outside. Les, be on your guard. Come on in, Pike. Do you think they are after Weight? It may be, he is dangerous when he drinks. If it was him, it makes sense that he showed up here. Maybe it wasn't him. The women have already gone to sleep, Tom. -Where's the weight? -He said he was going to see if there was coffee. Okay, guys, you can go to sleep. -And the weight? -I take care of him. -You are restless, aren't you? -There is no place for me to sleep, - there is no room left. -You're losing it. -You think? -You can sleep in my room, down the hall to the left. Thanks. Well, I think this is more than I did for you when you were little. But to tell you the truth, when you were a boy... Peso, are you the man the Apaches are chasing? You were always complaining, crying all the time. -You are the man? -You know when I decided that maybe did you turn into a great man? The day I brought you a bow and arrow and you hit me in the ass. -I think I didn't like you. -Do you like me now? You are a hero to all the children in the territory, but I never saw the point in putting a thief on a pedestal. I always thought you were going to follow in my steps, but no. You had to pull your mother, law and order. That woman gave me a headache, of my wives she was the one who spoke the most. -You are the man? -I'm not saying that I am. And I'm not saying that I'm not. But I offer you a way out. -What exit? -I take the safe and run the risk with the Apaches. -Is that the best you can offer? -I follow my path and you you'll never see me again. The end of Peso. What it says? -What makes you so honorable? -Do not know. Maybe I pulled after you. But I know I will never let you fool me. Tom, I want that gold. -Go to bed, Peso. -I don't want to kill him to get it. Good night, Peso. Good night boy. Weight. -Talk, boy. -I heard when you spoke to your son. -You don't have a gun, do you? -Not. I think Herrera is wrong, he should give you what he wants. Of course it should, but we must live by our rules. I would like to live under your rules, Peso. Would you like? Would you like to be a bandit? Well, that is natural considering who your father was. -But it's not easy, you know? -I wouldn't be afraid. It is not easy, boy. It takes a long time to learn. Believe me, it is just as difficult to earn a dishonest dollar as it is to earn an honest one. -Of course, you are your own boss. -I would be happy to do it. -You take me with you? -Well, we'll think about it. -We? -Yes. -Where's Miss. Webson? -The old? Boy, you have a lot to learn. Where's her room? That one. Thank you, go. -Hello, Fanny. -Weight. -Weight, when did you see me? -Since I arrived. -Saw nothing. -Say, why did you leave Las Cruces? - It was getting too dangerous. -That's true, woman. So I work in this territory, there are no laws here. There are no laws for me to break. I hate to break the law. Besides, I have a great job. -Where is it? -San Francisco. Seven and eleven, rolling the dice. This is going to be easy. Remember, weight? This is music to my ears, Fanny. I have a hidden whiskey bottle, take two glasses and we'll make a toast. It's been a long time, Fanny. Long time. To Peso, the happiest, the most gallant, the greatest man in this world. Fenny, the most adorable, the most beautiful professional in the north of Rio Grande. -How did you get here? -I'm eyeing a deal. That safe. -What is preventing you? - That boy, Tom. Put it in its place, take what you came for. -It's not that easy. -Children. They are all the same. He was faster than me, he took my weapons. They are all the same, ungrateful, they don't know the job of bringing them into the world. Tom is a good person, he has a good heart. What will you do now? What are your plans? I don't know, but I want that gold. I'm not worried about you, Peso, you'll think of something. You always think. You know, a man can take this business very seriously. He will never be smarter than me again. If only I could get my hands on some weapons. Good... -What caliber? -Any caliber, Fanny, 45. Fanny. I love you. It's not like the gift of Peso, I mean, it's not valuable. But I wanted to give it to you since you arrived. -What is it? - An amulet. It's beautiful. I made a hole for you to use. I wanted to give it earlier, but Amber is always after me. -Laughing at me. -Why? They know how I feel about you and how do you feel about it. Tone? I'm sorry, Luis. I can't change what I feel. Neither am I, I'm glad you liked my present. -Good night, Nancy. -Good night, Luis. We'll take over, Tom. Les is on the back wall, Duke and Amber are ahead. Why don't you get some sleep? I'm going to sleep. -Is there anything out there? -You can't see Apaches at night. Sorry, it was a silly question. Something tells me that they are getting closer. -Why don't you get some sleep? -Yes. Can't you see? -Why are you here? -Is it my bedtime? No, I just think you'd be better at home. I'm waiting for my dad. -Do you think he can do it? -Sure. Don't lie to me, Tom. What are his chances? His chances are good. He knew the danger, he left before the circle closed. In the army you are always in danger. He always lived in danger. Never the kind of danger you can face head on. -I have to sit and wait. -Take it easy. I'll be fine, Tom. It is normal to be afraid. Why am I a woman, is that it? Perhaps. Why do I have to act like a fool when I'm with you? Take it easy, I didn't mean to make you nervous. You made me nervous. I'm really nervous. There is no need to be nervous. Besides, I have my orders. Choose a position, keep the wind at your back, and shoot to kill. -Does she kiss better? - I can't decide. Let me help you decide. What do you have in mind, Duke? You know, Peso. Turn around. Stay quiet. Drop your weapon. And now start walking there. Drop the bucket. We can do that easily, guys. I give my word of honor that I will not be the first to serve. -Two against one, Peso. -Not with my serve. I will kill the first one to move. And the second when the first is falling. Any question? Good. Now, throw your rifle. Thanks. It's your turn, Pike. Slow down, Pike. With exchanged hands. Now, take the weapons. Slowly. Thank you. Now I want the key. Sorry to rush you, guys, but I'm late. The key. Take it, Peso. It's okay, take it. I hoped it wouldn't happen. - Drop your weapons, Peso. -Not. I need this key, don't be silly. You are not man enough to kill your father. - That goes for both of us. -I don't need to kill you, boy. But before you draw, I'll put a hole in your hand. Promise. -I taught you to shoot. -You taught, don't forget. You are very sure of yourself, aren't you? I am. Okay, you're asking for it. Are you ready? Make your fight. Tone. It's all right. He was faster than me. I'm sorry, Tom, this is the second time I'm afraid. Weight, are you okay? Only Peso's son can shoot like that. Go back to your posts. Ed, take over. - Aren't you going to arrest him? -There is only one place he wants to have access since he arrived, come on, Pike. -Hey, Mother. -Yes? Bring me a drink, please. - Well shaken, isn't it? -Shut up. It was a shock, Fanny. I tell you it was a shock. I know, Peso, but don't let that put you off. I was very slow, I don't understand. Don't talk like that, your tears will fall on my drink. -I really wanted that safe. -Where would you take him? This place is surrounded by Apaches. I know this land like the back of my hand. The rivers, the mountains, with or without gold could lose them in the first mile. I bet you could. Drink, Weight. Remember, you are the biggest, the bravest, the best man in this world. Fanny, you know how to comfort a man, don't you? This is something that a woman never forgets. -Never touch me, Fanny. -Yes. -Doing something here? -Yes, any objection? In no way, maybe there is something I can do for you. No thank you. Everything is working out. -Good night. -Good night my Dear. It's all quiet out there, Mr. Herrera. Tom, I was afraid for you. It seems that I was not the only one. -You were great against him. -I was lucky. I've seen Peso in action before. I had the advantage of being your son. -He would kill you if he could. -Not the way he was. How can you defend him after all this? It was he who brought all these problems to us. - There is no proof of that. -He gave that girl a turquoise bracelet, he said he had done it with the Apaches. What proof do you still need? Here they come! Go back inside and tell the women to take cover, quickly. Take care of it, quick. They surrounded us on all sides. I go to the other wall. I left Peso with the others, okay? This is more important, go to that wall, Ed. Luis, get the ammo, come on! -Fast, Luis, I'll help. -Go back inside. Come back here, you... Killing some more Indians, Peso? I thought I already did that at the party. -Can we hold them? - Shut up. -Excuse me. -I deserved it. You really know what you do, don't you? You bet. I can fight this battle. It looks like you're having my old problems. -What you mean? -Two ladies fighting for you. -Which one would you choose? -You know me, Tom. I always had the character to choose both. Herrera, they are retreating. They are retreating here too. It looks like they were just seeing what they will face. Luis, be on the lookout for a while. Thanks. Snowden, you were very skilled with that rifle. -Thank you -I would appreciate it if you tell me call me by my first name. -Cyril? -Cy. We did it, Tom. We did it. -Where's Amber? -I'm sorry, Duke. I'm sorry. -Is everything okay with women? -Sure. Do you think they are gone forever? -Do not know. -They left for a little while. -You mean this isn't over? -I hope the Major can get through. What if he doesn't succeed? Do we all have to die for this man's crime? -This is what you want? - Looks like I made a friend. Tom, I was already thinking about leaving here. My offer continues, give me the safe that I risk against them. Give it to him. -Here we go again. - There is only one of them, Herrera. This is undoubtedly Major Dekker's hat. And that eliminates cavalry. I am the boss, hand over the culprit, there will be no more killing. How long to respond? Until the sunrise. -How are they? - They're still arguing. - Trying to decide for me? -Yes. -Trying to deliver the Weight? -Some want it. -What you want? -May you decide, Tom. Then that's it... -I'm sorry about your father. -He died the way he was born. The way you lived. No tears? After. He taught you well. He taught me without teaching. This is the best way. I have to answer until sunrise. How can I deliver the Weight? Like? -I vote to fight. -If we had a chance I I would say the same thing, but there are women here, I have seen two massacres. -I don't want to see another one. -We did it once, -Maybe we can do it again. -Yes, maybe we can. Don't get me wrong, Peso, for me you can be hanged. But guilty or not, I wouldn't give in to Apaches. Did you decide? Tom, you have no choice, you have to hand it over. You are responsible for everyone's life this season. You don't know what you're talking about, I've known Peso for a long time, he may have done many things that he shouldn't have done, but he never killed anyone without a reason. So why doesn't he say? Why do we all have to suffer because he killed some miserable Apaches? You are a passenger here, not a judge. Amber is dead because of him, Tom, I tell you to hand him over to Gerônimo. It's like you, Herrera. You are the agent here. I have the rule not to interfere with a station, so make up your mind. -It's all right. -Tom, if you have no problem, I would like to talk to you alone. -Any objections? -Yes, he's convincing. -Don't hesitate, Tom. Weight wants a minute. He will have a minute. What do you mean, Peso? It seems that I put you in a difficult situation. If you want to expel me, that's fine with me. You may be wrong. -You will not expel me? -The station is still a haven for everyone who arrives. I will let you know that you will stay. Security and refuge, is that it? -Would you do the same for someone else? -Certainly. Anything else? No, that's all I wanted to know. Time is running out, Tom. What are we going to do? We will defend ourselves. Mr. Herrera. Mr. Herrera. Get the ammo. Men, come on, to your posts. That's because you hit me. -She shoots like a man. -Pour me a shot, dear. Hello, Pike. Why did it take? Did you know that they were after me? It wasn't hard to imagine, I knew it wasn't me. -So it had to be you. -Why didn't you speak? I'm not a hard finger. Okay, it's your turn to play, do what you want. -Take off your clothes. -No, Pike. I would lose my dignity. You heard me, start to undress. I don't mind showing my muscles, but where will it take us? Geronimo is after the white man who deceived him. I will give you the white man. -Luis, come up here with the ammo. -She's in the room. Go get it right away. This is not going to work, Pike. They know my face. When I'm done with you, you won't have a face to be recognized. I thought he was you. -Prepare my horse. -I will help you. Do as I say. -Weight. -Yes my dear. -Weight. -I'll explain later. Help me, Mother. -I won't stand a chance, Peso. -You'll get out of here alive, Pike. This is a better deal than you offered. They are not after my clothes, but their ugly face. Show it to them. Weight! Weight! Weight! Weight. Tom, I'm sorry. He was quite a man. There was no one like him. That's right. Well, he ran towards death. -He didn't stand a chance. -And he knew that. It's over, Pike. I didn't think Peso would do that. He tried to escape, but they killed him. He showed that he was lying. I should have let him have the safe. That's what I've been telling you all along. -Weight. -Live and beautiful. They wanted Pike, so I kicked him out. Let this be a lesson for you, a boy must trust his father. Your... Tom, if it's okay with you, I'll leave silently. The due diligence will leave soon, there is no reason to spoil the impression I made on your boss. -Weight died like a hero. -Wait a minute. To tell you the truth, I'm touched. It brings tears to my eyes. A good ending for a good man. -And the safe? -The safe box? I lost interest. After all, what is money? Nothing. Well, I think I will leave silently now. I never knew you were silent. This is the end of Peso. I give you my word of honor. -When will I see you again? -Who knows? Maybe when you have kids. -Bye. -Bye. Delivered intact, Luis. Luís. There's your chance. Leave the rifle cocked and eyes open. Yes, Mr. Herrera. -Everything is ready? -Almost. - Goodbye, Tom. - Goodbye, Lorraine. For a while I thought I could make him fall in love with me again. -And Mr. Snowden? -Something always goes wrong, remember? It's better this way, don't worry about me, I found a new friend. Of course, we've already covered everything. If you go to San Francisco, look for us. -Maybe I look for it. -We will have at least a dozen of ways to make a man lose his money. And having fun because he lost. -Good luck, Lorraine. -Thanks, Tom. Thanks for everything. -Where do you think you're going? -For due diligence? -Where? -I'm not really sure. So don't go. I would hate to lose it. You were important during the fight. And since you are so helpful, how about bringing me a coffee? What do I get out of it? Tom, that was a great experience. When I tell the company how you handled things, don't be surprised if they do -something generous for you. -Thanks, Sy. All ready. Go ahead. Bye. For a man who just lost his father, he shouldn't be so happy. Maybe I'll tell you one day, Mother. Maybe you don't have to, maybe I know that is the Weight. Perhaps I also know that he will collect the gold he came for. He will have trouble doing that, Luis is sitting in the safe and armed. What is so funny? Do you think you're the only son of Peso? He said that I had to learn to trust him. I hope this is the beginning. Translation Editing and Synchronization by WesternKasa / GM NOV2020
