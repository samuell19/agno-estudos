I will also take your name out of the list of the scholarship recipient candidates for Sunway University. But ma'am... Are you satisfied? Just because you're rich, it doesn't mean you can bully me! What's with you? You're overreacting. I'm here to study, okay? Not for you to bully me! So?

What were you thinking, making a video like this? Embarrassing the school. Sir, the truth is, my late father's camera was taken by Bianca. And I went there to take it back, sir, but-- But then you got drunk? I was set up, sir. You're able to attend this school because of the Committee's fund! You're supposed to know your place!

Do you know why this locker is kept open? This locker belonged to one of our seniors. But I forget which class. He was the son of a committee member who often came to the library. He was stressed out over trying to maintain good grades. But some say... he got depressed because he got bullied. He committed suicide. Suicide? He drank poison here. And he wasn't the only one, miss. -Excuse me, miss. -Okay. [loud, scary sound] Turns out that Alanda was not as smart as I thought. Just because her drunk video spread, she killed herself just like that? [scoffs] Weak. Alanda was not like you, Bi. Even now Alanda has died, you still miss her? Do you remember? I let you have your way with Alanda. I allowed you. You're still not satisfied. Is that it? If you prefer Alanda over me, go on, find her! Go find her suicidal haunting spirit. Go date her while you're at it! [sad music] I'll slap you! What were you doing with Davi, huh? Do you have to be such a flirt? You understand what I'm saying? You do not do such a thing! Davi is my boyfriend! You dare go against us? What were you doing, acting so pretty? What's your point? And these eyelashes? Hey, listen! [sniffles] You dare go against us? What were you doing, acting so pretty? And these eyelashes? Hey, listen! [playback stops] Just like those kids in that video, my daughter was a victim. Alanda was a victim of bullying at this school. [sighs] Ma'am, this video-- I know Alanda so well. She would never behave like that. From the first time I saw that video, I knew something was not right. But Ma'am, Alanda's video was recorded outside the school. -And I as a teacher-- -I want the school to take responsibility. -But, ma'am, I... -What more evidence do you need? For the school to investigate this case? Excuse me. [door opens and closes] Ma'am? Thank you. What do you teach here? I don't teach. I work at the library. Oh. [sighs] Alanda once told me. Riza used to insist that she study at the library. Alanda? My daughter. This is the evidence. It contains many videos about all the bullying experienced by kids in this school. Alanda recorded all of them. I know exactly what Alanda wanted. To stop the bullying in this school. And I will carry on her work.

[eerie sound] [somber music] Riza. [somber music continues] [footsteps approaching] I'm scared that she will come for me. After Bianca... I'm sure Alanda will target me. We have to tell the truth. That we were the ones who made Alanda drunk. We were there when the video was made. And get expelled? Are you more afraid of Alanda... or more afraid of getting expelled? [faint whispering] [faint singing] [phone ringing] [scary rhythmic music] [screaming] Key. What's wrong with you? What if Lula was right? That Alanda is haunting this school for revenge? Instead of thinking like that... we should pray for Alanda. Do not neglect your daily prayers. And don't forget your dhikr and night prayer. Key. You remember your daily prayers? [man] Peace be upon you. [praying in Arabic] -Za? -Yes, Father? How's your school? Everything's fine? Every noon and afternoon, you still pray at the clinic? I do. They say it's the coolest high school. They don't even have a prayer room? At least Riza still has a place to pray. How can we expect religious education if they don't even have a prayer room? What's important is that Riza can attend the number one school. Good curriculum. Good families. What more do you need? [Riza's father continues praying] [people chattering] I thought you had prepared your essay. About bullying at schools. And the effects on the teenage psychological condition. But... why are you collecting ghost stories? Arka, this is the ultimate impact. Imagine this. They got bullied at the school. They got depressed and ended up committing suicide. -Suicide? -Yes, suicide. And then, they say that their spirits are restless. -That's why they came back to haunt. -Haunt?

[loud, scary sound] [eerie sound] [loud, scary sound] [eerie sound] -Dav. -She came, Ger. I just saw Alanda. At her desk. So did I. [Geri] We have to do something. To stop Alanda from coming again. You still want to tell Mrs. Tanya? That we were the ones who made Alanda drunk that night, huh? What if we get expelled? What if our parents find out? Are you out of your mind? [Geri] We ask Mrs. Tanya. -To put offerings for her. -Offerings? Every student who committed suicide here, they put offerings for them. Don't. We're supposed to pray for Alanda. Not put out offerings. Suit yourselves. I'm going to Mrs. Tanya. [door opens and closes] The students will soon have their final exams. So, Mr. Arman, you must focus on that, not other things. Ma'am, I'm concerned. Alanda's mother sounded serious about what she said. Alanda's case is not the first. No need to panic. 14 DAYS TO FINAL EXAM -Ma'am, do you have a minute? -Yes? It's about Alanda, ma'am. We need you to put offerings for Alanda. Dav... Yes, ma'am. So that Alanda won't bother us anymore. -Ma'am, perhaps-- -[Riza] Excuse me, ma'am, sir. Um... perhaps it would be better if we arrange a group prayer.

Are we good? No more lingering spirits? All we can do now is hinder, ma'am. Not exorcise. We can't just pray once in a while, ma'am. We need to do it every day. It would be better if you listen to the wishes of the parents who have been suggesting that the school... build a praying room. PLEASE BE QUIET EXAM IN SESSION -Sir. -Yes. Okay.

You understand what I'm saying? You do not do such thing! Davi is... It has been a month. I haven't got any news from the school. I haven't seen any sign of any intention from either one of you to look into the death of my daughter. Nor any sign of any action to stop the bullying in this school. -Ma'am-- -I'm not done talking. [bag clattering] If I don't see anything to suggest you intend to solve all this, I will not stand idly by. This evidence here? I will release this to the media so that everyone will know that this school is crooked! [laughing] Don't laugh, ma'am! I will not accept that my only daughter, my beloved daughter, was treated like this! [screams] Alanda. [Alanda's ghost screams] [crying] [calm music] Ma'am? Every time we meet, you always give me tissues. [laughs] How are you? Alanda never told me anything about school. Perhaps because she thought... she didn't need to tell me. Because since the passing of her father, I'm the one who always depended on her. She always strengthened me. [sniffs] Yet I never knew... that she was the one who needed support. [sniffs] At school, she witnessed... even became a victim of bullying. That didn't just attack her physically, but also psychologically. But what was so great about her... was that she secretly tried to stop the bullying cases in her school. [Ratu] Ma'am, I will help you finish Alanda's project. We'll finish this together, okay?

[in mixed English-Indonesian] ...should've been a wake-up call. [in Indonesian] It should have made us realize that bullying is not a cool thing... and made anyone who liked to bully stop doing so. And Alanda's death should've made the school realize that they had to do something. Not just keep it quiet and treat it as normal. [sad inspirational music] This trophy is for Alanda.
