Bobby? Bobby home? Maria, Trevor is Hi, Mom. Hi. Dinner's in half an hour. Shut the door, please. Get back! Back! You're going to do exactly what I say. Alright, alright. -Take them off. -What? Take your pants off! Hurry up! All the way. Hurry up! Oh, Paige! For god's sake! That's a real gun! It's a stick-up, get it? Here, feel my heart. Come on, babe. Are you mad? No, I'm mad for you. Paige, listen. -What? -Look-- I don't find this very amusing. Kitten's in the house, so are the kids, so this is-- This is neither the time nor the place. Alright? Oh, Paige. Well, I've atoned enough for a lifetime. -Where's Frank? -He's allergic to church. But he's still flying in this afternoon I hope? Of course. He wouldn't miss the counselor party. Oh, by the way, my reception is still lousy and I was wondering if you could stop by in the morning and, um, fix the thingamajig. What about Frank? Trevor, you know Frank is not good with his hands. Well, I'll see. Thank you. Ellen, Bobby? Happy Easter. Tell Frank I need to speak to him the moment he gets in, alright? Of course. -Bye. -Bye. My says god stands on his head upside down and looks the other way. Drink to that. Trev! Trev, over here! There you are. I told you he'd be here. Well, you were supposed to get him to call me. -I tried. -Hi, Frank. -Everything okay? -Fine, old chap. Hey, look at this crowd. This guy over here just came into a fortune through his wife. Ripe for the picking. How does he know all this? Sources, that's my middle name. And this is my wife, "Sorcery", in case you haven't met. Frank, you're always so clever. I think I'm going to go get a drink. Hi, boys. How are ya'll today? Well, I got a group that I think I want to tell you about. Uh, we got to get some money. Excuse me, ladies. This is man talk. Well, we'll go socialize. Now, I got this little group down in Albuquerque. These fellows say they got to get rid of six and a half million before the end of the year. Oh, that sounds promising. Um... Um, can I have a word with you? - Excuse us. - Yeah, excuse us. Frank will fill us in. Listen, Trev. You got to make it fast, now, I got a date, so what's up? The investors have asked Reg to look into the books. He's come up short. Eight hundred thousand dollars short. -You sure? -Mm-hm. Listen, this hotel is a joke. Listen. If we're short, the whole company's short. Trev, the money on that one is coming in faster than it's going out. It's coming in so fast, the books, they don't even have time to balance! Hey, listen, come on! At least, there's a bright side to it. -Austin-- -Trevor. I'll check into it, I promise you. You know I will. Hey, look at that. See what I see? -Lydia. -Hi! Lydia, let me present my oldest, most loyal friend in all the world: Trevor McQuade. I have no idea, mother. It's just green. Everything's green. \N Probably man-eating orchids or something. Listen, I better go. Trev just walked in. Yeah, he says hi. I miss you, too. Yeah. Bye-bye. So how's your mother? Oh, she misses us. I miss her, too, Trev. I know. You said it was just going to be a few years. Aren't you ready to go home yet? Well, I went home once and it wasn't there. I mean, our home, Cleveland. Kitten. Home is where the heart is. That's corny but it's true. It's not Cleveland, it's not England, it's... It's right here. With you and me, and the kids. Well, they're happy. Well, I'm not. What a pleasant surprise. You drink too much. You were always charming. At least I wasn't interrupting anything truly intimate. I'm not stupid, Frank. No, but you're way out of line. A deal's a deal. What's the matter, big guy? Huh? Can't take the heat? Taking this way too far, Paige. No, I'm just beginning. Poor baby. I get off. And you don't. It's not fair. What the hell are you waiting for? Fuck you, Paige. Hey, Frank! Just in case you forgot, this is how I like it. Hard and straight up! Look, guys. I think we have a potential serious problem here. This is one of the biggest projects going in the rear Sao Paolo area. A hundred million dollars. So tell me, can a simple book-keeping error account the missing million bucks? It's one percent, Trev. It's possible. What do you think, Frank? I say there's no mistake. That was no mistake. Reggie double-checked the figures. Reggie's full of it. Tell him to look for it up his ass. As our legal counsel, what do you say? Frank, you want to look up Reggie's ass, you tell him. Cut it out, you two. -Excuse me? -Yes, Lillian? Mrs. Kallum on the phone. And no, it's for Mr. McQuade. Hello, Paige. What can I do for you? I missed you this morning. Well, Frank's right here. Do you want to speak to him? Put him on. And I'll tell him how you make me hot. Well, we're in a meeting right now, I'll... have to check on it and get back to you, okay? No, it's not okay. Teahouse for lunch. Sounds great. I'm sure Kitten would love it. Thanks for thinking of us. Bye. Where have you been, hm? Not here. Please stop that. Are you grumpy? Paige, I said cut it out. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Alright, I'll tell you. I don't like the way you're starting to behave. What are you talking about? Coming to my house with my family there, flirting with me in front of my wife at church. There's someone else, isn't there? Of course there's not. Well, don't lie to me, Trevor. I know you. You can't live without it. Paige, look. It happened and it was great. But now I think we should cool it. I said cut that out! You love it when I'm like this. I don't. I really don't. You're such a prude. Hey! You're going to get fat! Oh, that's so bad for you. It'll sit in your stomach all night. Hey. Remember when we used to live off this stuff? Hm? Yeah. I'll never forget the first real meal you made me. I know you'd think I was poisoning you. What was I supposed to think? That was my mother's recipe. But you could've played tennis with those meatballs. -Trevor. -What? I'm not in the mood. Well, you're never in the mood. Oh, yeah! Nice try. You know, Trev. Things have never been better. We're rich, we've got our health, the world is full of not-so-proper ladies. What more could you want? Well, speak for yourself, Austin. Maybe the world isn't quite as perfect as you think. What are you talking about? Well... To be the perfect husband and the perfect father, I slip up once in my life and... You're skating on thin ice, Trev. Yeah, well, all that is over. Well, it'd better be over. It's too close. You got too much to lose. You know, you and Kitty are family to me, Trev. When I first introduced you, you seemed like a match made in heaven. Maybe you just got married to young. Hell, it's probably my fault. It's mine. And I don't want to hurt Kitten. Ah. Obrigado. Obrigado. Big fish, hm? Nope. Just a little horse in the sixth. You know, Trev. I don't like to see either one of you hurt. But the way it is now, you're hurting and she's hurting, no one wins. It's not too late sow a few wild oats, if you do it right, there's no crime. Austin, drop it. -Next game. -Let me tell you something. There's such a thing as no-strings attached service. Discretion assured. It happens all the time. You know what I'm talking about. Am I right, Frank? I've been saying that to him for a while. Look, I know a woman. You should let me fix you up. I don't want either of you to fix me up. It's not my style. Are you sure? It's a hell of a lot better than divorce. Look, if you don't like it, there's no harm done. It's easy. You'll see. Wait here a minute. I'll be right back. Oh, come on, Frank. What are we doing here? I got a deal. It'll just take a minute. Look at this stuff. This is real money. Forty-five thousand dollars. Go on and appreciate art. I won't be a minute. Do you like it? Yes. Do you? Yes, I do. I prefer primitive art, though. With snakes and scorpions. I think real art deals with fear. The ancients thought you could tame it if you made it real physically. We still do, don't you think? With snakes and scorpions? Yes. But the forms change of course. Now we put, um, monster movies on the cable. Murders, sex, too. All finished. Let's go. See anything you want? Fellas. Our hostess. I'll have the usual. I'll take a scotch. Trevor, I'd like you to meet Pandora. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Well, you're in good hands. Excuse me. Sure. Paolo, on the house for our new guest. So, Mr. McQuade. You have lived in Brazil long? Six years. And do you like our country? Why, yes. It is earthy, it is not? How do you say it, sensual? Like the river in the forest. Perhaps you have not met the river in the forest yet. Again. This is Gisele, Mr. McQuade. Hello. Listen, would you excuse me just for a moment? I've just seen someone I know. Sure, be comfortable, please. Hello. Do I know you? Well, the art gallery. The snakes and serpents, remember? Yes, I remember. What are you doing here? I thought I'd find you. Really? Yes, when I saw you at the art gallery, I rather liked you. I see. Well, what were you doing there? Apart from giving me the once over. I work there part time. I'm a painter. Do you remember the one on the corner? Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. I'm Trevor McQuade. -And you are? -I'm Miranda. Miranda. How do you do? How do you do? Listen. Look. Would you like to have dinner with me? Alright. Obrigado. But then, then disaster struck. What? Well, I had this rich old uncle who'd gone to live in the States, in Cleveland, and unfortunately, he died. Even more unfortunately, left me his entire estate. Including his investment business, so here I am. Let's see. Well, I lived in England for a while. -Really? -Yeah, don't you miss it there? I really loved it. Well, yes, occasionally, I mean, London, perhaps. -Is that where you lived? -Mm. Well, I lived everywhere, actually, in New York. I was back and forth to boarding school in Switzerland. Really? Wow, I'm impressed. Look, you took me to dinner. Let me take you someplace. Okay. Good. Let's go. I've created a monster. Oh, come on. Let's go. Watch me. I'm quite sure! You know, I'd really liked to see some more of your paintings. -Are you sure? -Quite sure! May I? -Sure, of course. -When? -Anytime. -Where? Here? No, I have a studio. I don't have a phone. I'll give you my address. I had a great time tonight. So did I. Ciao. Mrs. Kallum, please! Lillian, it's okay. Ooh. What kind of lunch is that? Out the hair, the dog that just bit me. Are you and the dog? What are you doing here, Paige? Baby, are you alright? I'm fine. What can I do for you? Don't treat me like your wife. Paige, I don't need this. I want to see you! As I told you, I'm not going to put up with it. It's very simple. You can't have it and not have it whenever you like. It doesn't work like that. Trevor. Everything alright? Investor profiles. Money transfers dating six months back. Trevor, you remember what I was telling you. Oh, Frank. I got to run. I'll catch you later. Well? How'd it go last night? From the look of things, I'd say you got laid. -You know that girl? -Gisele, yes. No, no, the girl from the gallery, Miranda. Who are you talking about? Well, there was this other girl and, uh... We went out. It was fun. "It was fun?" What, are you crazy? I mean it. Great! That's really good, but you didn't get laid. No, I didn't. I paid good money for you last night. What the hell's wrong with you? Nothing that you'd understand. Why, 'cause I didn't go to Oxford? They're all prostitutes, Trevor. Some just cost more. Mashed potatoes? No, thanks. Don't start. Start what? I saw you looking at your watch. Are you going somewhere? -No. -No? Why not? -Please, can we have one-- -Why not, Trev? Why not go out and stay out all night? It's perfectly alright with me. Okay. Maybe I will. I won't bother to wait up. Beautiful, beautiful. This, my love, is for you. Great. Obrigado. -Ciao. -Ciao. Obrigado. -Oi, Trevor. -Oi. Come on in. I would've called first, but there's no number. It's okay, I'm glad you found it. -So I took a chance. -Mm-hm. Is this your work? Yes. Now, this I like. Oh, yeah? Do you want to buy it? -How about some wine? -Oh, no, no, no, just... Just water will do this time. Thanks. -Oh, I don't have water, sorry. -Doesn't matter. I didn't come here for a drink. Or to see your work. I came here to see you. I know. I can't sleep. You're keeping something from me, Frank. Austin has been asking questions. He's a pain in the ass. Go to sleep. You better watch your back! This is perfect. -Right here? -Yes, yes. Yes! This is the most unusual date I've ever been on. Well, I'm glad you decided to come along. Trevor, Trevor. I passed this place a million times, I never stopped to look at the view. Watch your eyes. The end. Trevor should be here any minute. Damn well better be. Goddam phantom accounts. Exactly how much, Reggie? Two, three million dollars. Every day more. What? It's just not possible. Trevor signs most of the wire transfers himself. -I'll vouch for him. -Thank you. Gentlemen, forgive me. Trevor, this cash problem's really getting serious. My investors are nervous. That's right. The phone never stops ringing. Well, Austin, are you sure you've checked out all the wire documentation? Yeah. So far, I hadn't found anything. Well, listen, all transactions are traceable, so we'll-- We'll just have to keep at it until we find it. I just bought a painting. Don't every go behind my back again. I don't like it. I told you. This girl's not for sale. She's a big girl, Pandora. Why don't you trust me? I know you too well to trust you. Do you want someone else to keep you company, sir? No, I don't. What would you do without me and my girls? I don't know my love. You make me mad. -Relax. -"Just relax." You're a fool. I'll do what I want. Yes, I know. You won't listen to reason, will you? I know what I'm doing, Pandora. -Do you really? -Yes. Very well. Then you're in for a lot of trouble, and so is he! Someone keeps calling the house and hanging up. Did you hear me? Well, what was it? Wrong number? No, he stayed on the line breathing. I can hear them. Thank you. Hey, how are you? Paige, Frank. Louis, how are you? You know Kitten, of course. Hello, nice to see you again. -Trevor. -Hey. Great party, Trevor. Fresh blood. Work the room, come on. Honestly, I find these affairs so boring. Well, I don't. It's the only time I get to dress up. Trevor, you should take your wife out more often. Yeah, Trev. Mrs. McQuade, may I have this dance? It'd be my honor, cousin. Let's go. Excuse us. Shall we? What? Dance, Trevor. Frank says you're going out of town. Just one night. No big deal, Paige. It's not like you. I'm old enough to sneak away from home now. I bet you are. By the way, someone keeps calling our house. Know anything about that? May I? By all means. Why did you do that? Smile. You're making a fool of yourself. Well, that's your department. It's a game, Paige. You mate, and I check. I have an extra job, you know. You don't know where you're staying? Ramiro. Lillian made the arrangements. I'll get you the number. Okay. Look, I've got to go and check on those accounts myself. I rely much too much on Frank and Austin. Well, I never did trust Frank. My compliments to the chef. Oh, Miranda. -Hm? -Listen, the other day, I-- I went by your art studio but you weren't there, or at your apartment, so... Well, I thought maybe you might be at Pandora's, so I went there. I had a day off. But sometimes you are there, no? Yeah, sometimes I help there. I see. So tell me, who does this all belong to? A good friend of mine. -Friend? -Yes. Yay! Miranda. No... -It's silly. -What? Well, I have this romantic notion that I want you all to myself. -Old-fashioned. -Old-fashioned? Trevor, you're married. Yes, I know that. But I'm also jealous. I can't help it. Well... I am who I am. Let's go in. Hello? Hi, where have you been? Oh, Kitten, I-- I'm sorry. I forgot. I fell asleep. Yeah, yeah. I just got in. Everything's fine. Yeah, yeah, and you? Okay. Look, I'll call you from the office tomorrow morning when I get here, alright? Okay. Mrs. Kallum, you don't seem to understand. I'm trying to be helpful. Do you want to leave a message? Mr. McQuade won't be in the office today. Mr. McQuade, I tried to stop-- I think you should get her a pet. Okay. I came by to tell you that I'm going to take Frank to the airport later. And I'll see you tonight, you can tell me all about your trip. Paige! Yes. Well, there he is. Thanks. I'll get the car and come back for you. Don't worry about it. Nobody knows. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Excuse me. Hello? Frank's in Rio. Did you forget? Well, I-I-I can't talk about that now. Who is it? If you don't get over here right now, I'm going to take a full page ad out on the Wallstreet Journal! -We have guests here. -Trevor, who is it? Austin! Tell him no work tonight! Fine, I'll be right over. The paper's at the office. I could go and get them right now. Yeah, okay. Alright. Oh, please forgive me. I've got to slip out to the office just for a few moments. -I'll be right back. -Hurry up. Enjoy yourselves. Business! What the hell are you trying to do to me? Trevor, I just want things the way they used to be. Oh, for god's sake, Paige-- What does it take to get through to you, huh? No, no, please. I'll be any way you want, I'll act anyway you want. Please, you just got stop treating me this way, please. You really don't understand, do you? There is another woman, isn't there? -Isn't there? -Listen! It's over. Over! So get out of my life. If you leave me now, I'll never take you back! Get us a drink. Anything strong. Mr. McQuade, how nice to see you. -Join me for a drink. -Oh, no thanks. That's her cousin. Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. Calm down. This is not the end of the world. To hell with you, Pandora, and your world. Hey, you're coming with me. I don't seem to get through to you, don't I? Hey, get lost, you! -What are you doing? -I'm taking you home. I can't believe how rude that was. -He was my cousin. -Oh, come on, Miranda. For-- Spare me the explanation. Alright, I'm sorry. Well, you're acting like a mad man, Trevor. Because I care for you? Is that so awful? -No, but you can't-- -For god's sake, can't-- Don't you see, I'm in love with you! -Would you... -Yes. Yes, I would. This is it. And now that you've saved me from a fate worse than death, I bet you need a drink. Thank you. Cheers. Okay, Trevor. What? I'll do it. I won't see anyone else. Where the hell are you? Hello? Who the fuck is this? Who is this? What makes you think I'm having affairs? I wonder why, Trevor! Is that what you want, huh? Who's the damn caller? Tell me, please! Look, I'm not making it easier on you because-- Because what? Because you're boring me! You're bored with us! You're bored with us! Oh, Kitty. You're the one-- -Don't touch me! -I can't even touch you anymore! I can't talk to you! I'm under a lot of pressure. I would appreciate a little understanding, alright? You're just not there for me anymore. Not there for you? I've been there for you for 20 years! You changed, Trevor! I don't know you anymore! Get out you stupid bitch! Fuck! I am so glad you called. We never get a chance to go out and play anymore. Oh, you're having wine. Um... Uh, gin, double, straight up. Okay. -How are you? -Fine, Paige. You look great. Stay away from my husband. What? Come on, I know all about you and Trevor. Don't be-- Thank you. Don't be ridiculous. He's Frank's partner. What do you think I am, crazy? Trevor is the last man in the world I would have an affair with. You're really upset. What is it? Talk to me, 'hon. Maybe I can help. I am not seeing your husband. I don't believe you. Well, I don't know what else to say. What makes you suspect him? Stay away from him, Paige. Grow up, Kitten. Trevor's at your beck and call twenty-four hours a day. He's home, he goes to the office, he goes back home, what more do you want? He's out late every night. Every night. Problems, Paige? Money isn't enough for you anymore? You're losing your touch. Maybe I'll have to replace you. I'm going to tell Trevor. Don't even think about it. If you boys don't get your act together, this company is going down the drain fast and I don't like it. I got a lot of money invested in this thing. Well, everything Trevor and I own is in this company. Hell, my reputation's on the line. Reggie, how much time have we got? Well, the investors called a meeting for the end of the month. So that's two weeks. Bo, you can stall that. Yeah, well, maybe I don't want to. Give us a damn break. Trevor's on top of this. Well, somebody's been skimming and they're doing a good job of it, too. Austin, who's in on this? Kallum, McQuade, Howard, Mendez, Eros, Jackson, and Jones, Patterson, James, Ferretti, shall I go on? James? We're not even certain the problem is in this project. Well, I say it is. We've been in on dozens of deals and this has been nothing but trouble. Look, we have 15 days to find the money and if we don't, we're each looking at 10 years in jail. I don't believe it. She's a whore! Ow! You're hurting me! I'll do more than that if you don't get out of here! Does your precious wife know you're with a whore? Get out. Oh! It's you. Queen of the sluts! Take her out. Let go of me! This better be good, Austin. I want to know what in the fuck is going on! You take your fucking hands off of me! -You're lying to me! -You're the liar! Fuck you! You son of a-- I own you, sweetheart! Don't forget it. They called again. This time, they said your husband's fucking a whore. Perfect. How about here? Hey! -Are you crazy? -What is she doing? -Are you alright? -No! -That was her, wasn't it? -Yes. How could you get involved with someone like this? She's crazy! -How was I to know that? -Well, it's obvious, Trevor. She just tried to kill us! Oh, god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm calling because I miss you. Listen. Li-- How is making you rich using you? Yes. I don't care what he says, you're in complete control of that. Because I trust you. We're a team, Pandora. Ha! Is that what you call it? You've been promising more than that for years! I know, but I've meant it for years! I'm tired of waiting for you, Frank. Hey! I'm in Guarujá. Why don't you come out? Ciao! Go home, Paige. Before I call the police. You could've killed us the other day. Shall I come in? For a quickie. You call my wife one more time and I'll kill you! When the cat's away... What a better time. Paige, get out of here. You know, Trevor... The pictures turned out great. -What? -The sex. Paige, I'm warning you, get out! What the hell was I to you? A convenience? Yes! As a matter of fact, that's exactly what you were! Now you're an inconvenience. No! No! No! Paige, come on. -Trevor? -Listen to me. Trevor. Surprise, surprise. You son of a bitch! Here's your bed. You made it, you can lie in it! You really think I fooled around in here? Kitten! Listen! Nothing happened! Oh, bullshit! Get out, Trevor. You can sleep downstairs tonight but tomorrow morning, I want you out of here. -Kitten-- -Get out! Alright! What happened? -Who are you? -McQuade. Trevor McQuade. -You know these people? -Yes. Well, yes, of course! Well, Frank Kallum is my business partner. Well, what's happened? Mrs. Kallum was shot. Murdered, we believe. Oh, my god. Let's go, Mr. McQuade. We can talk over there. I'm Lieutenant Santos of homicide. Tell me, Mr. McQuade, what are you doing here at this hour? I live just around the corner. Oh... I came over here to talk to Frank. Mr. Kallum is out of town on business. I'm sure you knew that. Yes, I-I forgot. You knew Mrs. Kallum, too, as well as her husband. Yes! Of course! Mr. McQuade, the man heard the shots at 10:27 p.m.. You were where at 10:27 p.m.? -At home. -With your wife? -Yes. -You're sure? Well, we had this fight and I was... I was sleeping on the sofa. Oh, I see. Of course I'll need to talk to your wife. Right now? It can wait until morning. You're not planning on taking any trips, -Are you, Mr. McQuade? -No, of course not! Good. I can expect your full cooperation in this matter. We'll need you to come down to the station to get your prints. Well, mine must be all over this house. Routine, Mr. McQuade. Just routine. Well, I'm glad she's dead. She was a horrible woman and I hated her. At 10:27 last night, where were you Mrs. McQuade? I didn't kill her. Well, you had reason to. I was asleep upstairs. Alone? No, Trevor was here. So I'm not grieved. What of it? I didn't kill my wife. I was out of town in Guarujá . You can prove that? I stayed overnight at the Casa Grande. I just drove in this morning. We're not interested in where you stayed overnight. We're interested in where you were at 10:27 last night. Probably in the bar having a drink. Did you know that your partner and your wife were having an affair? Yes. How did you know? He doesn't. Now he knows. Didn't it bother you? Everything about my wife bothered me. I hoped she'd leave me for him. -And? -He dumped her. At least he tried to. He fell in love with another girl. Paige flipped out when she found out. The other woman. Do you know her? Dad! They think you did it. I need to talk to both of you. Let's go outside. Well, that's... That's it. I hope you can believe me. I also wanted to let you know that... Though I'll be moving out, I'll always be there for you. No, you won't. Mom says we're going back to the States. Good morning, Mrs. McQuade. Can I come in? You're going somewhere? Yes. Oh, I see. Well, I need you down at headquarters today. Just a few questions, that's all. We found these among the belongings of the victim. Addressed to you. By law we cannot open it. We need to know what's inside. How many more, Trevor? Sorry about that. I had no idea. What did Miranda know about Mrs. Kallum? How do you know about her? Your partner, Frank, told us. You leave her out of this. She doesn't know a thing. Come on. You know that isn't true. Never underestimate the weaker sex. They have a way of carrying around their truly bulgers mind. Bulgers? Bulgers. See you, Mr. McQuade. Trevor. You alright? I'm fine. Thanks for coming. Trevor, this isn't true, is it? I mean, you didn't do it. Did you? No, of course not. Well, the press think I did it. Well, they're going to have to prove it first. Well, that's reassuring. The problem is the police. They want me down at headquarters right after. You want me to go with you? No, thanks. Trevor, listen. I'm really sorry about you and Kitty. If there's anything that I can do, you know you can stay with me. Thanks, but... Right now, I need to be alone just to think things through. I understand. I don't think I can rely on, what's his name, Detective Santos to get me out of it. Hello, I made a reservation for McQuade. Trevor McQuade. I've got a funny feeling about this, Trev. -Hm? -Frank might've done it. And it is certain that we can carry nothing out. The lord gave and the lord hath taken away. Son of a bitch murdered my wife. Is that so? I'd say you'd stand to gain more than anyone else from her death. - I'm clean, Austin. - So am I. And I don't intend to go to jail for money I didn't take. Tell that to the cops. They're crawling all over the place. Maybe I will, you bastard. In case you haven't heard, blackmail is against the law just like murder. Our sources tell us you and Mrs. Kallum have been seen together lately under less than friendly circumstances. I didn't kill her. You were involved with your partner's wife. You wanted out, she didn't. Case closed. I think I'd better call my lawyer. Please, everyone involved is a suspect. We're just gathering information. -We're not accusing you. -The hell you're not. Look, what if she killed herself? There were powder marks on Mrs. Kallum's right hand. That would suggest suicide. There were also powder marks on the carpet which could suggest an accident. But it looks like there was a struggle. She could've faked it. And bruises on her buddy. Two shots were fired. One in the wall, one in the ceiling, and one that killed her. Entered at the base of her jaw. Well, you're... Certainly well informed. We think she was overpowered by whoever killed her. Well, she was probably drunk. Yes, she was. We don't have the murder weapon. But we're looking for it. And for your information, it was a pistol. Now, how long have you been seeing her? Trevor? -Where are you? -I'll be right out. Trevor? I'm sorry. I just saw on television. Why do they think you did it? They know all about Paige and me. Now, Frank knows and Kitten does, too. About us. How do they know about us? Paige took photographs. Do they know she tried to kill us? God knows. What are you going to do? Can they arrest you? The detective in charge of the case wants to. They just put me through it. Now, listen. He'll want to talk to you, too. Why would he want to talk to me? I don't know her. I don't know anything about the woman. I don't know where she lives or anything. Miranda, are you sure there's anything you want to tell me? I mean, it's something I ought to know. No, of course not. Alright, okay. I believe you. Search warrant, Mr. McQuade. You don't waste any time, do you? Help yourself. You won't find anything. Other than more fingerprints! The just came in. They started asking questions. They asked about Mr. Kallum. Listen. It wasn't me. You were fucking her, you miserable son of a bitch. Frank, it just happened. "It just happened?" I'm your partner! Was your partner! I want you out! Well, that's not so simple. You're forgetting I own half this company! Which isn't worth much. You've been too busy fucking my wife and your silly whore to notice. You used to be good, Trevor. But then you got your brains and your balls all mixed up, now you're going to pay for it. So long, chump! I hope it was worth it! Legally, there's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Oh, come on, Austin. This is Brazil. Can he force me out? Maybe for sleeping with her, not for murdering for her. Oh, very funny. Especially considering we have a loss of eight million dollars! He can buy me out without even going to the bank. Not after I get through with him. I fucking hate this, Trevor. I got in too deep gambling. These guys I owe money to are going to kill me. You're not trying to tell me... You took the money? Fifty thousand dollars, that is all I took. Frank found out about it, he and Paige had been blackmailing me to set up these offshore accounts. So that he could steal from us? It sure as hell looks like it, doesn't it? In the beginning, I thought they were just empty tax shelters and he was playing with the IRS. Well, where are they? He's got companies and accounts strung out all over the Caribbean. Austin, I need to see the evidence. Trevor, I've taken the bank records home. Don't worry, they're safe. They're under lock and key. Jesus Christ, I'm trying to pull this mess together. Oh, no. -There he is again. -What are you talking about? Sherlock Santos. I'm Lieutenant Santos for homicide. I know who you are. What are you doing here? This is a robbery. I already reported it to the police. I thought that there could be a connection. -A connection? -Yes, with Mrs. Kallum. I'm sure it's probably just some kids. Strange. We're closing. I'm looking for Mr. Kallum, Frank Kallum. -Have you seen him? -I don't know. Thanks a lot. Your island accounts. Number one, two... And three. It's all there, you happy? Not really. You used me and I don't like it. I don't know what you're up to, but I don't intend to go to jail for it. Keep your mouth shut and you won't. You're damn right I won't! -May I have those? -Not on your life. Now get out of here and don't come back. Fine, my love. Whatever you want. Okay. Hello. Welcome. Thank you. I'll get your things. Ah-hah. And look, just for you. Fine. Fine. I'll take it. No, don't answer it. Hello? Yes, wait just a minute. It's for you. Another woman. Hello? Yes? Well, is it important? I see... No, no, I'll be in, yes. It's okay, thanks. I met Frank six years ago. It was already set up down here so it seemed like a natural place to go. I belong to all the right clubs and he could hustle. Clients trusted McQuade and Kallum brought them in. It was... It's quite a match. But everything was a deal to him. That's all he cared about. I felt sorry for her. Maybe he wanted you to take care of the home fires as well as the office ones. Look, I had needs, so did she. Anyway, it's a lousy excuse. So there's not much else to tell except I didn't kill her. We found this among Mr. Kallum's belongings. Uh, an airline ticket, and a check. Ten thousand dollars made out to Miranda. -To Miranda? -It's your friend. -Do you know what it's about? -No, I don't. Uh, oh, yes. By, the way, we've arrested Mr. Kallum for the murder of his wife. We have him down at headquarters if you'd like to talk to him. We have found the gun. We got a tip. A figure had drove back, killed her, and returned it to And would've let me go to jail for murder. I think he had just decided to take advantage of a tricky situation between you and his wife. He's in the last cell. Bastard. Why? You planted the gun, didn't you? You killed Paige. Why? Because we played you like a rubber band, old chap? Paige and I? We were a good team until she changed. Until she wanted you and not the money. Well, I fixed you. I fixed you both. So that was the plan from the start, eh? To take me over? From day one until she became a pain in the ass. Excuse me. You're free to go. For now. I didn't do it. I wanted to do it. But I didn't. Your alibi checked out so I can't hold you. He tried to set me up. Mr. Kallum, don't try leaving the country. So you finally learned how to play hardball, huh? You with your Oxford old boys and your perfect family and all the right people... Doesn't become you. Why did you pay Miranda ten thousand dollars? You didn't think the lady was free, did you? Huh? Did you think it was love? You son of a bitch! You tried to destroy me? You set me up with Miranda! And with Paige! And don't you ever touch me again or I will break you in half! I knew you'd fall for Miranda. And I knew Paige would go crazy. You got a problem with that? Nothing I wouldn't want to kill you for. First, you better tell me where you've hid the eight million dollars! I don't think so. You'll never see it again. Oh, you're wrong, Frank. You're wrong. I will. When I do, you're going to spend the rest of your miserable life in here! Go on! I never needed you! I never needed anybody. There's nothing I can tell you. We think Frank Kallum was using you \N to set his partner up in some way. He wasn't using me. Frank Kallum paid a lot of money for you. What? He never paid for me! Do you know Frank Kallum? Yes! No, no. Don't let me interrupt. We're just finishing up. He paid you 10 thousand dollars. Yes, he bought a painting from me. There are other checks to Mrs. James. -Do you know about them? -No, I don't. Do you? Who is this Mrs. James? -Clementine James. -Clementine-- Would you mind telling me what all this is about? I'm looking for the motive. It's not enough to hate your wife, even when she's having an affair with your partner. Where do I look? Where there is money, Mr. McQuade. Oh, come on, Santos. Cut the crap! Why don't you ask her about the checks? Good evening. Alright, Miranda. -Where is it? -What? The money that you and Frank stole from my company! -I don't know what you're ta-- -Oh, yes, you do! Yes, you do! Frank was paying for you and Pandora. You were in on it, weren't you? Trevor, he gave her money all the time! It had nothing to do with me! He was always at the club! You saw him there! It was a setup, wasn't it? Frank, Paige, Pandora, you! Trevor, listen to me! Frank and Pandora were lovers! He said he was a good friend of yours. He told me-- He said you should what? Fake it? -Fuck me for free? -To be nice to you! Well, you were so thank you very much! What's wrong, Trevor? No, don't touch me! You're just a 10,000 dollar fuck bought and paid off by Frank! Don't you talk to me that way! - Please. - Please! You stay right here. Don't move now. You son of a bitch! Oh, Jesus Christ, Trev. I could have fucking killed you. What the hell are you doing? Lydia, it's Trevor. What the hell are you doing, Trev? Austin, I'm sorry, but I... As I've told you, I have to see those bank accounts. You're too late. Somebody broke in the other night. They took everything. Oh, no... Not your gambling buddies again! If it had been them, they would've taken a hell of a lot more than just bank records. Just give me the names of the banks involved. It's going to be much harder this way, -but at least-- -Trevor, it's too late! Most of the money is gone! I mean, sure, we can track it. But there's just going to be barely enough money to pay both the investors and to keep our asses out of jail! This company is ruined! Here, I got this for you. It's 50,000 dollars. I told you I was going to pay you back. I'm sorry it took so long. Austin, thanks... I appreciate this, but, uh... I didn't really care about the money. Unless I can clear my name. Look, you were right. Now I'm sure it was Frank. He and Paige, they were in this together. Well, they told me that. But she became obsessed about me and so he-- And then she became a threat to Frank. Yes, yes, of course. So he had to kill her. But I can't prove that, unless I can link her to these missing documents. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Frank, he cut Paige out of this all together. He was involved with another woman on this. There was another woman. Her name was, uh... -Who? -Jesus Christ. Jones! Jones, her name was-- No, no, James. -James, that's it! -Clementine James. Well, that's it! Of course, it was obvious. I mean, Frank and Paige, Miranda and James! What the hell are you talking about? Where are you going? I think I know where we can find our Mrs. James. Not without me you're not. Let's go. It should be right here. -This is it! -You sure? I could shoot you both for this and get away with it! You mean like you and Frank shot Paige Kallum? Well, here's your motive. The assets of McQuade and Kallum all nicely squared away. You're going to jail, Pandora, along with Frank. I run a respectable business. I can't afford to be a thief. But you are. You and he were partners, Mrs. James. Yes. For years, I brought in your investors into Kafi, a legitimate one. But this time, he used me to steal from you like he used you and everyone else. I transferred back whatever money's left in your account. The receipt is there. She's right. I believe you lost those the other night. Take them and get out of here both of you. I'm innocent. But what about Miranda? She knew nothing. She really loved you. She's a nice girl. You mean, one of your girls. If you really love her, what difference does it make? We've lost the money, but the board has chosen to except it and to give you and Austin another chance. Hell, everybody deserves a second chance. Right, boys? I wonder if we'll ever find Frank. Man could get lost in Brazil if he wanted to. Of course we will. He can't leave the country. He'll show up sooner or later. What difference does it make? I say let's get on with it. Hello, Miranda. Hello. There's something I need to talk to you about. May I? What do you want? Well, first, I'd like to apologize for what I did. And also I need to talk to you about the gun at your studio. You see, I saw it and... I know that it had belonged to Paige. I see. I tried to forget about it but I couldn't. I need to know what it was doing there. Why? Because I'm still suspected of killing her. But you didn't do it and they can't prove it. Okay, then, because... Well, you remember I once told you that I loved you. You see, I still do. "Love?" I thought Frank 'loved' Pandora. I watched them for years. I just couldn't stand to see her unhappy anymore. But why would you care about her? She's my mother. Yes. I was there. It was an accident. I went to talk to Frank about Pandora. You're Mrs. Kallum? Were you expecting someone else? I don't know... So, you want to speak to Frank? Yeah. Come on. Oh, and close the door. So you're Frank's wife? And Trevor's lover. It's a small world. Where's Frank? He's not here. Was it something important? Doesn't matter. You enjoy making other people as miserable as you are, don't you? -I really feel sorry for you. -Really? Why don't you try and convince me not to kill you now? What are you doing? Come and sit down. We'll have a little chat. That's a good girl. I had the gun in my hand. I didn't know what to do. I was stupid. I don't know, I just ran. Why didn't you tell me? Why would you have believed me? No one would. So you planted the gun on Frank? No. Someone took it. It just disappeared. I thought maybe you took it. No! I don't know then. I guess it could've been anyone. Would you want me to go to jail? Would you let me go? I don't have an alibi. You know what I think? I think we're now both free to do what we want. Be what we want. What do you want, Trevor? Right now? Right now, I'd like to go for a walk on the beach. How about you?
