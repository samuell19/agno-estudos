[Moncel Durden] All right. So, I want y'all to think about something. Think to yourself, what is the first sound, song, rhythmic structure that I can remember? You're hearing the heartbeat. You are getting rhythm. You get accustomed to sounds and the rhythm patterns of those sounds. And so you are passing down information. Before you're even here, that memory is coming from mother to child. So, we're getting this information and we're growing up with it and it just makes sense. We might not be able to explain it, but that way of moving a body, this is how the people in my community move. So when I start dancing, I'm right there with you. You don't have to teach me how to do a dance. It's in my blood. It's in my community. I just do it. [Debbie Allen] I view dance as the original art form. Man was standing his feet upon the planet, leaping, spinning. Before we could write, before we could even talk, we were dancing. [Saleemah Knight] Jazz dance, it's the way that we live, breathe, and speak on a daily basis. It's a conversation. It's about seeing the people around you and really feeling, with empathy, who those people are and understanding how you relate to them through movement. [Melanie George] If jazz is about humanity, and it is, there are infinite ways of being, and we should be allowed to move through all of those spaces and claim jazz. The one thing that I ask of every single person when they're working with this material is, say where you got this stuff from, and if you're not sure, investigate and do the research. In the same way that no one owns jazz, no one's really making up anything that didn't come from someplace. A part of why our history is not understood is because we don't attribute and we don't call back to what came before. We are always steeped in, like, now and there. Like, what's beyond? The history allowed us to get to now, so it's our responsibility to the form to attribute where stuff comes from.

And if I can't say that on camera, jazz dance is the illegitimate child of dance. ♪ Oh, so baby ♪ ♪ Le Jazz Hot may be ♪ [George] I don't know what's more American than jazz. Enslaved culture, migratory culture, indigenous culture can be found in jazz. It's such a hodge-podge, a ragout of lots of different things that came into the pot. And so, in that very American way, we sort of steal from everybody and find something new. When people speak, they tend to lie about things and dance is honest. It's all the backgrounds of everybody and it's really what they feel in their heart and their soul. Jazz has a heartbeat and a rhythm that makes people move very differently from any other dance form. Jazz is inspired by the rituals, the rhythms, the sounds, the earth, the community. What was happening with dance, with jazz, dance, and music here in this country was actually mirroring what was happening in the country historically, politically. Jazz is always political because it's imagining a future that we could share. And how great could that be? ♪ Oh, before ♪ ♪ It's time ♪ ♪ I got nothing ♪ [Durden] The culture of dance is deeply embedded in Afro-diasporic people, deeply embedded.

It's how we express our self through joy, through sorrow, through pain. ♪ I went ♪ ♪ Went in the valley ♪ [Lindsay Guarino] You can't dismiss the way that racism has impacted jazz dance. The greatest misfortune that I see today in jazz dance is that a lot of the times the roots aren't acknowledged, and a lot of people don't even know that the movement they're doing is stemming from that place. The atrocities that a lot of our ancestors had to face, they put into their dance, into their music. They expressed themselves and released their tension and their stress through their art. If they didn't have these outlets, man, I don't know if they would've survived. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ My soul... ♪ [Knight] We never start African or Latin history at slavery. We start before that. So we look at what was going on in those countries or on those continents before it was interrupted. So, when we're looking at the lineage of jazz dance, we take the Juba and the Shika dances of the Nigerian peoples and we bring that to the United States by way of the transatlantic slave trade. [DeFrantz] That's part of what the Middle Passage did that's quite different than how the dances might have developed on the continent because there's so tiny room for Black Americans to maneuver socially that the embodied movement that becomes jazz takes on that much more potential, possibility, urgency. [Knight] So we arrive here and we've got this automatic sense of percussiveness in the body and how important that became when you're also thinking about a group of people whose cultural practices were taken away from them. Now you're just who you are as a person, devoid of what your once identity was in your original country. [Michael Blake] For slaves, their dance and their music was all they owned for themselves. [Dr. George Faison] It could reach the hypnotic level of releasing them to that other place where they weren't slaves, where they... they were free. [Jason Samuels Smith] The Slave Act of 1739 wouldn't allow Africans to use drums and the reason was the revolt that was organized in this year was organized by playing drums. They communicated with each other with different rhythms. And so, after that, if any African was caught playing drums, their hands were cut off. So, this rhythm and this music, this spirit was then redistributed throughout the body. Juba is a social dance that started on the plantation. What they did was use their bodies to make the sounds and to still communicate with each other and really continue that community. [DeFrantz] So, Patting Juba Almost immediately sets a standard for jazz as this exploration of rhythm and playful fun but also a political possibility. So, information can be shared through how the rhythm is disrupted or arranged. [Smith] And that grew into more social dances where you entertain the idea of being elevated, of being white, of mimicking European court dances. So, that's where the cakewalk evolved from. The cakewalk was a dance done on plantations where the Africans who were enslaved at the time would literally make fun of their masters. They would present themselves and their partner, and they would be dressed in a certain way. And so, Africans would create these dances to mimic and imitate them. [Camille Brown] It was a way for the enslaved Africans to resist and in the moment of oppression, they found a way to release and to find humor and joy. [DeFrantz] The cakewalk is the foundation for all of Broadway dancing and thus, the foundation for jazz. The cakewalk is the originary moment where something new is produced by this American experiment, if you will. But also this way that Black Americans are disavowed and pushed to this place where creativity is aligned with political possibility. Black Americans had zero possibilities for professional life. We have our first forms of occupations around minstrel shows. So, the foundational avenues of employment that lead to jazz dance are tied up in this history of denigration and of flattening the complex social and political lives of a really diverse group of people into two-dimensional stereotypes. The traits of jazz dance are variations and rhythmic patterns, because when you think of jazz, jazz moves. It speeds up, it slows down, it has a variation. So, it's not just one thing. And what jazz is, is it took this African predisposition to syncopate, if you will, to overlay a rhythm different from this ground rhythm. And it made the rhythmic life of jazz dancing filled with surprises. I think one of the key tenets of jazz is improvisation. Without you bringing your own interpretation of it, it's not jazz. [Graciela Danielle] You are not up here like in ballet. You are down there. You are digging on the ground. That power, that passion, that sex. What else is there in life? [Siegenfeld] The great significant trait is polyrhythm. Meaning there's a beat going on, the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You know, if that just keeps going on and keeps going on, we're gonna fall asleep. But what the jazz people did was individuated against it. Come on. Come on. Come on. [Knight] The Harlem Renaissance, we look at it as the African-American enlightenment movement in the United States. Circa the 1920s, you've got music, dance, philosophers, writers. All doing great things at the same time. And during this time there was a very big racial divide. But in New York, There were white bodies that were really interested in being a part of the movement. [Allen] Black America was setting the trend, then like we are now. The Savoy Ballroom in New York was one of the first places where they could not stop whites from coming and having this wonderful socialization with Blacks over dance. It was unheard of, but you couldn't stop it, it was just so hot up in that ballroom. [jazz music playing] [Siegenfeld] The Savoy Ballroom, it was the very first integrated public space in the United States. The dancing was so extreme that they had to replace the floor every three years. [Knight] And it would just be people dancing to classical jazz music, doing swing dances, jitterbug, Lindy Hop, all the dances that you imagine when you think about the origins of jazz dance. [Brown] There is a dance, there is a social dance that comes from the community, that lives in the heart. It's in your blood, It's in your spirit. It's that vernacular dance that was homegrown that comes right out of the streets and it's infectious, it's joyful, and it relates and connects to what's happening socially, politically, culturally, at any given time period. [Karen Hubbard] These social dances evolved from the plantation dances of the enslaved Africans and then were embellished and performed on stage, and national dance crazes evolved, like the Charleston and the Lindy Hop. The Lindy Hop is social dancing. The dance movements come from the community. Lindy was, everybody come to the club, learn what it is, and you can add your own signature thing to it that influences everybody else to be as creative as you are being, and you're all dancing. [George] We're disenfranchised in most parts of this city but we get to go to this ballroom and we get to compete against each other, and it's about pride, and it's about reputation. It's about self-esteem and we're expressing it through movement. This was really the time when Black and white bodies were in conversation with each other, kind of became okay for a girl from Upstate New York to start moving her hips in that way. And the Harlem Renaissance was really the beginnings of those conversations. [DeFrantz] We get to the 1930s and there are progressive whites who were curious about Black culture, not only the parts that they're allowed to see but something closer to how Black Americans imagine themselves among themselves. And these ballrooms make this possible. And then we start to get towards jazz dance. Broadway changes. The dances on Broadway start to look more like the dances that African Americans do at home. They get more rhythmically sophisticated, they get less knowable and more open. And then we really see a shift and this happens up until the second World War. [Smith] You can't talk about American success without tap dance being a part of that story. It's important for people to know that it came out of a place of struggle and oppression. It wasn't just this happy dance that was made for other people's enjoyment. It was made to express and to communicate a certain feeling. There's always been a big argument whether it was tap dance that created jazz or jazz that created tap dance. [Smith] Tap dance is older than jazz and it led to certain social dance forms like Lindy Hop and swing dance which then led to jazz dance. [Knight] There's also a relationship between African and Irish culture where we see this percussiveness coming into play, with Irish traditional jig dances and also African Juba interplaying with each other. [Smith] The roots of tap are African dance, West African dance 2.0. It's what happens when you take a culture and a style and you put it in a different part of the world and you put the people that experience that art under extreme pressure and under the worst conditions humanly possible. Most Black people in America can tap. I don't know. It's just a thing. You're born, you're Black, you can tap. Don't get me wrong. I love to dance. I love to dance and I got work. I was cute. Cute little colored kid. They called us colored in those days. Cute little colored kid tapping away. Oh, I was a real novelty. Of course, by the time I grew up, it's a different story here. He's an adult Black man now, he's not so cute. Give him a broom. Raymond. The rich don't patronize tap. [Smith] There's a little bit of a fear still to embrace tap dance culture entirely because of the ugly history that it's attached to, which is American history. And unfortunately, I don't think a lot of people are willing to face the truth of what happened or is happening right now in this country. And we're always going to reflect those truths, whether or not they can handle them. [Allen] It's kind of impossible to talk about jazz dancing independent of the music, because the music truly through the ages, defined how the dance would go. This to me could also come through as how important is oxygen and nourishment? Every person in my family was a classical musician and to hear that jazz music, something shifted really deep in my soul. There is an emotionality and a depth that is in that music for me that I'm always trying to get to and to be able to describe with movement because there's such honesty, such heart honesty. [Kimberley Cooper] When I hear that sound as a choreographer, that springs images and movement in my head and makes my body... It gives me that invitation, that I feel jazz music does. Jazz music has all the accents and the moments that happen in between that you don't expect, and being off the beat and being pushed and just all the variation of styles and percussive nature and elongated notes, it's all in there, which, physically, as a dancer, you can relate to and connect to. At one time, the music, jazz dance and jazz music, went together. And the dancers were performing to live music and it was an exchange between the musicians and the dancers. [Parker Esse] It is so overwhelmingly fulfilling to dance with a jazz orchestra live. I don't think there's anything like it, because you... you're an extension of that... of that music, it's powerful. Years and years ago, jazz music was to move to, it was to dance to. And then as people doing improvisations got more and more adept, then it became about "Look at my skill in improvising." And maybe not quite so danceable. And then bebop... And then bebop messed it up. For jazz dance. The musicians of bebop messed it up. And as the music changes over time, as the styles change, then the dancing that's done to the popular music, popular styles, also changes. The music got too crazy to dance to, really. So, music and dance went their separate ways. ♪ Forget your troubles Come on, get happy ♪ [Francis Roach] The jazz dance that we all iconically know from the Hollywood days, that's different than the jazz dance of the Roaring '20s. ♪ The sun is shining, come on, get happy ♪ During that time, when Hollywood was doing its Golden Age, that was after World War II. The whole world was in turmoil and needed some uplifting and some joy. ♪ Across the river, wash your sins away in the tide ♪ The idea of male role models for dancers was few and far between. I didn't know any professional dancers, I didn't know any male dancers, I was the only boy in my school but I knew who Gene Kelly was, I knew who Fred Astaire was. It's just those character men and women that I really... that's what I wanted to do. My mother would watch old movies and I fell in love with a movie uh, I didn't know the name of at the time, but of course everybody knows it, which is Singing in the Rain. And I liked Gene Kelly a lot. The way he was... I guess his articulation, the way he was accentuating the music but then also his character and the way he was telling the story always and how the dance was kind of infused into the storyline and I got kind of drawn to that. [Warren Carlyle] Gene is athletic and masculine and it always felt like watching the Olympics, watching him dance. And Fred is just... is beautiful and elegant and nonthreatening. You know, he's romantic and, yeah. They were the two different qualities and the two different male dancers that I grew up watching. And then I also grew up watching movie musicals. So, you know, I'm seeing Fred Astaire, I'm seeing The Nicholas Brothers, I'm seeing Bill Robinson, I'm seeing all these famous dancers, and I'm seeing very vivid colors and sets, and costume, and as a kid, it's just, it's like watching cartoons, it just grabs you. I would kill to be Cyd Charisse's partner. I would kill for that. [DeFrantz] What happened in the 1940s and '50s that is a turning point for jazz is it started to be codified. And what's interesting about this is it could almost never be codified by Black Americans because we still didn't have access to courts of law or legal systems of support. So, almost all the jazz dance techniques are initiated by white men. [Hubbard] There are like two different worlds. The worlds where ballet and extensions and turns, battements are valued. Training is valued. And then, there is the social swing dance world. And it's, like, two different worlds but the swing dancers understand the vernacular vocabulary and the evolution of jazz. What happened was that the modern dancers and the ballet dancers got a hold of jazz, pulled it into the studios and made it be what they wanted to do and they called it jazz. [Natasha Powell] And we had ballet choreographers or modern dance choreographers who are doing their interpretation of what they consider jazz to be. And then, you have critics who are writing about what they think jazz is, not having any historical reference to the form or any connection to the work. Now, how does that change how society thinks or believes what jazz to be? And how does that change the form and evolvement of what it was and who was instrumental in that? [Wendy Oliver] There were two big streams. People who felt that jazz dance was this original vernacular form that only happened in the '20s to the '40s. And there were people who felt that jazz evolved. And jazz became something different over time but it's still jazz. [DeFrantz] Something else about how Black American social structure works is that we believe in each other and sharing. It's communal. We don't really have long traditions of individual ownership. We're not so big up on claiming it as our technique or our style or "this is my dance and no one else's." That's quite a European-American formation or a capitalist formation. So, there's a real, like, problem when people start naming names and saying, "This is who invented a step or a style or made a technique." And Black American culture, it just doesn't operate that way. So, it's hard in jazz dance, because we know it comes from a lot of that lineage, to really put a thumb on who the mother or father is. Although, in America, we tend to give the credit to Jack Cole. But I think, when we look at the true origins of jazz, that may not be the right lens through which to look at how jazz came about. So, around the 1940s, Jack Cole is looking at classical Indian forms and starting to incorporate that into his jazz dance movement. So, you see this idea of isolation that is indigenous to jazz dancing, a lot of that really starts there, where the head may move from side to side, the arms may have some very particular, angular motions to them. And Jack Cole was taking a lot of these ideas and incorporating it into his choreography and the dances that he was creating. I saw Mr. Cole in a convention. This kind of tall-ish, evil-tempered person, which is intriguing, and everyone seemed to be In love with that kind of antagonistic attitude, maybe. We didn't know who he was. He came in with boots, khakis, a tied shirt, and a drum, and he was crazy. Seven, eight. Walk, two, two, two, three, two. Work. Jack Cole created a technique. Was it taken from Ted Shawn, Ruth St. Denis, the Denis-Shawn years? Yes. Absolutely. Everyone was involved in his life that he put into his pot. They didn't call their stuff jazz. Sell those bananas. Let's do it again, ladies. [Chet Walker] When you look at Marilyn Monroe today, it was Jack Cole who gave her that persona, Rita Hayworth, same thing. Marilyn wouldn't do it without him. If you'll go and you'll look at Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and you'll look at Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend, she is never looking into the... into the camera ever because he's over here and he is doing it with her. But when you think about that, "Oh, what?" Then you look at it, and you go, "It's amazing." Because she's not playing to a camera. She's taking from the master. And they had a connection that was like no other. He wanted audiences to understand what dance was all about. Dance didn't have a prominence. It was background material. The stars were the most important thing and not the dance. You can't talk about jazz dance in America without talking about Katherine Dunham. I know you can talk about Jack Cole but you got to talk about Katherine Dunham. For us, she is the mother of all dance in America because it is that African heartbeat that has defined the style of America to the world. She was influenced by Afro-Caribbean movements combined with Graham and classical ballet. And she, not unlike Jack Cole, had studied Eastern dance. [Smith] She actually started as an anthropologist. And through her studies in anthropology, that led her to dance. Because she realized dance was one of the oldest things that humans have been doing on this planet. [Danny Buraczeski] Americans have these puritanical ideas about the body and about sex. And because it was so... uh, it wasn't sexy, but it was so sensual, they had completely devalued what she was doing even though it was just extraordinary. And she was a scholar, researcher, made a phenomenal movement. I mean, the Dunham technique is just breathtaking but they just devalued it. As a child growing up in Houston, Texas, in the '50s, everything was segregated. Water fountains, white only. Movie theaters, white only. Restaurants, white only. And the dance schools were no different. They were not really allowing Black children to train and dance with white children. I went to the local school, Mr. DeBato, and I learned tap dancing and a little ballet. But I had a bigger image of what I wanted to learn. And it was actually Patrick Swayze's mom, Patsy Swayze, who taught jazz dance, who saw me outside of her school. I was peeping through the window and she and that wonderful Southern drawl, "Little girl, what you doing out here? Can you dance?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said, "Well, bring your shoes tomorrow." And so, she allowed me to come and take the class. [Rick Odums] I just happened to see a dance performance and I was fortunate enough to meet the principal dancer, who was Debbie Allen. And she was from Houston like me. So, I asked her, "Where can I learn to do this?" And she told me, "You need to go see a woman by the name of Patsy Swayze." Because unfortunately, at that time, or fortunately for us, she was the only dance teacher in the entire state of Texas that would accept Black people at her school. Patsy was considered to be one of the prominent jazz dance teachers. And from my understanding, Patsy had basically based her work on the teacher that she had studied with, who was Matt Mattox at that time. [Bob Boross] Matt never called his work jazz dance. He was of the thinking real jazz dance is the social and vernacular forms of jazz. Back in the late 1940s, Eugene Loring was creating a class called freestyle, where he's saying, "I want to take the best of ballet, the best of modern, the best of jazz, the best of this, and put them in together to one American form of dance." So, Matt was there during that process and would teach there. So eventually, when Matt left, he had that from Loring and then he had worked with Jack Cole, so he had the style of Jack Cole. And those two things came together in his later teaching. [Nat Horne] I heard someone beating a drum, one of those tom-tom drums, down on the hall and I said, "Who was beating this drum every day I come to class?" And they said that's the class by Matt Mattox. Our jazz teacher. So, I opened the door and I went in and I looked, I listened. And I saw all these isolations, and the training. They stood in one spot for almost half an hour or 45 minutes just doing body isolation, head, shoulders, rib cage, hips, legs, parallel legs, turn their arms. All of these different position. I say, "That's close to ballet." To me, that was the closest thing to ballet technique I can get. And so, that's why I started it. [Boross] So, Matt was taking these ideas from Jack Cole. He said, "When I first - started teaching in New York, I was teaching for two years, - anything I learned from Jack Cole and the students could not do it because of the isolated nature of the movement." And that's when he said, "How do I make up exercises so they figure out how to move individual parts of their body?" So, between head, shoulders, rib cage, pelvis, those were, you know, the things that led him to create the exercises that he did. Accent, reflex, rhythm, dynamics, relax. [Horne] Matt and Jack did not want any expressions in their face. No expression. Keep that all inside. And I wanted to express what I was feeling. Matt would say, "Why are you smiling, Nat?" I said, because I can feel this, I'm enjoying the music. "No smiles." Cut. [Martine] Matt was a very integral and simple and truth man. He never try to be false or to use... he was always doubting about himself. And trying always to get... To get better because it was never enough, you know, and I have learned that about him. I have a great respect and love. Each people would teach his technique. Teach the way they understand it. And then they put back with it their own sensibility. [Vicki Willis] One of my teachers in Calgary came back from New York with this crazy technique. And she had been studying with Matt Mattox. And so, she was a very thorough teacher and we were really immersed in Matt's technique. Then, at one point, she came back from her New York travels and all of a sudden, we had our arms above our head and we were stretching this way. And we started doing Luigi work. The Luigi Technique, much of the most, important draw about it was the man himself. First port de bras. Five, six... [Bill Waldinger] Luigi had been in a car accident and he was paralyzed on one side of his body and the doctors told him he would never walk again, And determined to dance again because he was a dancer. He developed a way of rehabilitating his body. Stretch the right arm over to the left. [Roach] His exercises were much more of a serious nature because of what they had to do. His technique had to rebuild a really broken spirit and a really broken body. He used the image of pressing down on the bar. Right? There would be this imaginary bar and he would press down on it and use it to lift his weight out of the paralyzed leg. Both arms in front of you. He would start out at the bar, use the bar for support, do these exercises and then step away from the bar and press down on this imaginary bar. And that is the foundation of the technique, this idea of using the space in the room for the support. Passé and down. And so, he would do these exercises extremely slowly and talk about what everything felt like. It really was not about what it looked like. It was about what it felt like. Now, 15 seconds... The energy in that room was not like anybody else's class. He was really, really remarkable in that way. Left arm in your chest. [Blake] He was so intensely involved in it that it just didn't... it was infectious. Like, when he starts moving his chest and shoulders, it was like you could see he was in a trance practically. And we just loved it. I mean, I had to follow that. And I did for quite a while. In five, six, seven, brush. A one, two, toe, heel, toe, heel. Passé back. Brush. Repeat. Toe, heel. [DeFrantz] It's complicated to try to understand how Latin rhythms or Latin expression becomes embedded inside something we think of as jazz. So many of the enslaved African people were brought through the Middle Passage to the Caribbean. And most Africans were then stolen to South America. So, these affiliations and sort of windings through and sharings are as old as the slave trade. [Sekou McMiller] These are rhythms that came into Brazil and into the Caribbean and into New Orleans and they're starting to fuse them. And people say, "Oh, it's new music. Oh, it's new music." But really, it's more like a great reunion of a culture of music that was once one. [Brenda Bufalino] Cuban music had a great influence on jazz. Then when the bars went up on Cuba, American jazz switched to Brazilian music for its influences. And so then, we started having cool jazz. [Joshua Bergasse] There's something about musicality and syncopation that excites me. I was doing a show and the songwriter, he was on my case about everything being so syncopated. I was talking about my father who's from Brazil. And he said, "Oh, that's what it is." "You're Brazilian. That's where all of your syncopation comes from. That's why you're driving me crazy with this syncopation." Some of these innovators start to claim Latin as kind of their difference in jazz. But if we really wanna understand, I mean, that starts from the beginning. I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the '70s. I went to a little dance school and so like many other kids in America, I started with tap ballet. I started when I was three. And in my teenage years, I went to Giordano's in Chicago. That was the first time I had gone away from home. But it was the first time also I felt like an adult in class and really had a mentality and a fighting thing that was underneath to say, "You can do this." [Phil Laduca] From Gus, I learned discipline. I learned that the body has to balance in a certain way. It has to move and counter move. And those disciplines were not what I was used to in the freestyle improvising of street dancing. [Nan Giordano] The markers of the Giordano Technique, are the movement comes from the pelvis. And that's where everything comes from. So, it's got a very organic quality. It's combining the groundedness, influence from Africa with the ballet world. Very technical and you have to have amazing technique. And then the modern world, it's really a combination of the major dance disciplines. It's got to be real. That was a slogan that my father continually said. The way that he lived his life was with energy, power, radiant, and touching people's lives through jazz dance. There's a misconception about the relationship to... between ballet and jazz. And it's really important that people understand that there has been this kind of very deep relationship that George Balanchine had with the jazz dancing body. Balanchine had direct contact with some of these Black bodies during the time of the Harlem Renaissance. Josephine Baker, she was a very prominent artist in the United States. Well, what Balanchine appreciated about Josephine was her ability to get down, that polycentric body, multiple centers in the body - That could articulate and speak to each other all at the same time. And so, he was looking at ballet and deciding that he wanted to make something new, thought, "Well, what if I take these Africanist aesthetics from this particular body and the jazz dancing body and I incorporate that into ballet? What does that do to take ballet off of its axis?" Somebody like Jerome Robbins, his jazz is absolutely based in ballet. But he's taken on that jazz to exemplify the character that is being portrayed. [Linda Murray] Robbins is made by virtue of the fact that he was rejected from school of American ballet, which is the New York City Ballet School, the Balanchine School. He was rejected from there and he gets his start with Gluck Sandor, who's teaching modern dance. A friend of mine said, "Oh, you've got to see this." She called it a musical comedy. I said, "I hate musical comedies." Oh, I was such a snob too. Oh, my God. What a snob. My chignon, my first position. Are you kidding? It's disgusting. I had never seen it. Disgusting. I had never seen a musical in my life. I had never been. The only musicals I've seen is movies, you know. And they were one of that, "Oh, that's not for me." She said, "Well, I think you should see this. It's done by Jerome Robbins." So, when she said, "It's choreographed and directed by Jerome," I said, "I'll go." Yeah. And I saw West Side Story. And that changed my life. I went out of the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre, sat by the Seine, by the river, and said, "I have to go to New York to study that." And that's what I did. [Bergasse] The first movie, the first time I realized I wanted to do musical theater was when I saw West Side Story. West Side Story. West Side Story. West Side Story. West Side Story. West Side Story. I mean, West Side Story. Suddenly, a new world had opened its doors to me. That was jazz. That's what I wanted to do. Jerome Robbins' work kind of exploded and that straightaway captured me. His choreography is very muscular. It's very... It's very grand. It has great scale. There's a lot of danger. I fell in love with not only Robbins' movement, you know, it was this mix of ballet and jazz but also with his ability to tell a story and to convey character. What West Side Story showed me was that you could be a tough guy and yet you could still dance. I mean, how cool was that? When they would do these long, extended dance sequences, I understood why they were dancing. I understood what they were trying to say. And that helped me understand the story and understand what these characters wanted and needed and/or were deprived of. ♪ Boy, boy, crazy boy ♪ I think, personally, what the secret of good theater is is conflict that leads to resolution. Tension because there is no answer. And then eventually, our hero finds the answer and finds his way. Bob Fosse was the quintessential sculptor of tension and conflict. Sexual tension, conflict, dysfunction that's so deeply seated from childhood, from past marriages, from whatever it is, from social injustice, it's... it goes into the body and it crunches the body down. He grew up dancing in a lot of vaudeville houses. stuff. I mean, he was around strippers and a lot of that stuff. And you see a lot of that influence in his work. He would always say, "I couldn't turn out, so I turned in. And I had bad posture, or whatever, you know, so I let it come down like this." He was, you know, pigeon-toed. You know, he was a little guy. There always seemed to be something in Bob that was just so cool. It was just, ah, right in there. It was addicting. It was heady. It was... it was, ah, jazz. I think that the turning point for him was Pajama Game. And Gwen then entered the picture. She was his muse, absolutely his muse, and I really think that the work with Gwen sealed it. [Kim Greene] If you look at his dancers, there were no cookie cutters. It's not, "Oh, this is Made up of bunch of this and a bunch of that." It's like, there was you. There was me. There was this person, that person. We were all different. We all brought our own thing to the table, that he would then take and just mold and make a masterpiece out of. So, we were doing The "Cell Block Tango." And, of course, I was speaking in Hungarian. My whole monologue was Hungarian. And the only English was "not guilty." He corrected and gave directions to everybody. Oh, I know this. And he never said a word to me, bad or good or... nothing. So, one day I said, "Bobby, is it okay what I'm doing? I mean, 'cause you haven't said anything to me." And he turned around, looked at me. He said, "Well, frankly, I don't understand a word you're saying, and I made up my mind that you are guilty." Well, it was like a knife because I had decided that she wasn't. My work on the character was that... This is so good. ...she was not guilty. This is so good. I had a whole story going on. I have goosebumps. I'm having all those... It was like somebody had... And just before leaving, he turned around and he went, "Right?" I thought that's the greatest cruel, cruel, greatest direction I've ever gotten because he made me feel like Hunyak felt. Yeah. During the entire freaking show. He was cruel. It was cruel... He was cruel in that way. He was cruel. But it was fantastic. But the whole thing was cruel towards the Hunyak. Fantastic. I have goose pimples too. It was just... I know. One of Fosse's main descriptions for dancers was that they were actors who communicated with their bodies. So, he didn't call them dancers. They were the company and they expressed themselves and they told that story through the movements in their body. You could look at a dance as if it were a script. So, the steps are like the words in a script. So, you dance the meaning of the steps. Not just steps for the sake of steps, any more than you would act a script just with the words. You don't have to know what it is. I'm the only one that has to know the story. But there has to be something internally going on with everything. When we're doing the number "Big Spender," Gwen would say things like, "Think that you're pushing through Jell-O as you're moving through the number. Roll your shoulder like you're wearing a dirty bra." You know, I mean, it's just... all these amazing images would be used. [Bonnie Lanford] These dancers lining up against the bar in the dance hall waiting for these men to come and choose them. And they are broken, they are broken dolls. The minute you say that, it's not girls posing on a bar. It says so much more. And, to me, that just adds these layers that make it so expressive and deep and at the same time, funny. His big theory was contain and explode, so that you would keep something very quiet almost like a little secret, and then go, "Ah!" ♪ Do you wanna have fun? ♪ [Culbreath] A lot of times in dances, there's lots of stuff going on and you just sort of choose what you wanna look at. With Bob, everything was specifically designed to focus in on a hip or one person's hand or the nod of the head or suddenly there's a shimmy of a shoulder. [Blake] It's the restraint of it, you know, having to hold in, it's like having sex without having an orgasm, so it's just... You know, it just... it's bubbling up underneath you. How's about it, Palsy? Yeah. I think there's a lot of ways to look at the history and who's important, and part of why someone like a Mattox and a Giordano and a Luigi get talked about so much was because they codified their vocabulary. And also, let's just be frank, Mattox, Luigi, Giordano have a ballet influence. And, for better or worse, that told people that it was legitimate. But here's the thing. What if the fundamental construct of the reasons why your movement exists is based on not having that organization that never changes, because that is a very Eurocentric model? So it isn't that the people who didn't codify hadn't thought it out, it's that they're saying the philosophy on which the thing we're building doesn't require codification. So who are you identifying? Whew! It's an incomplete list. It is a list that has a colonist mindset. It's always gonna be an incomplete list because the people that we've elevated, the way that history works is that then becomes, like, the gospel. So, it's flawed. It's flawed. Honestly, Black and brown people and women don't get talked about enough in the history. [Murray] The way people value your art form is based on the sort of historic importance it carries, so people place a lot of value on music and on literature because you can see a body of work amassing over time. But with dance, you don't have that, it is an ephemeral form. And in fact, as a discipline, we often embrace that fact and glory that fact that you only have that one moment where it exists and then it's gone forever, and that's part of the magic and the tragedy of dance, we sometimes don't want to give that up. But the problem is, when you don't keep your history, then you don't know where you've come from, and you can't really know where you're going if you don't know where you've been. I want us all to be more curious about the names we don't know. Because Pepsi Bethel should be on that list. [Hubbard] Pepsi was an authentic jazz dancer. In fact, his company was the Authentic Jazz Dance Theater. He never talked about his professional experience. It wasn't until years later I found out that Pepsi was a Savoy Lindy Hopper. In rehearsals, Pepsi always indicated what he would do. He'd say, "Well, I'm gonna go over here and I'll do this, and I'll go over there, and I'll do that," blah, blah, blah. Didn't know until I got on stage with the man, he was amazing. It was like sparks were flying from his body, and he was scatting, and I was stunned for a moment, you know? I'm always researching. I love research, you know, and I just decided to look up jazz dance, and I said, "Where's Fred Benjamin's name?" You know, you see Bob Fosse, see other people. And that's part of the problem, is that there's only very specific stories being told. To be on this planet during the '60s, in the midst of segregation, to still be able to create your voice in the midst of that, that's real, because Bob Fosse and Fred Benjamin had two very different paths. And I think this is why it's important for so many voices to get lifted up because it's easy for things to just kind of fall away and not get acknowledged. These are people who were so dedicated to the form that that was their whole life, and then they pass away, and if not for their families, you know, out of sight, out of mind. literally. Without JoJo Smith, there's no Broadway Dance Center, literally. He started a school, and then that school became another school, which then became The Broadway Dance Center. But without JoJo's Dance Factory, you can't even get there. One of my biggest influences in my style of dance and jazz was JoJo Smith. JoJo Smith. I saw a special on television, and I saw dancers, they were dancing with an undulation and a smoothness and a fierceness. I said, "Who the hell is that?" [Sue Samuels] The different jazz masters, the early jazz masters came through ballet training, so their styles were rounded in some way. Not JoJo. JoJo came through the martial arts. And his mother was in Katherine Dunham. So, the dance and then martial arts had, like, a square-ish kind of style. [Smith] Before JoJo's Dance Factory, which also my mother, Sue Samuels, helped build, every dance teacher had their own studio, and so you had to go to this one studio to get ballet, you had to go to this studio to get tap. You had to go here to get jazz. They actually brought all the styles and techniques under the same roof for the first time, and they don't get credit for it, but now, I look around the world and all dance studios are modeled after what they started in the '70s. These are these names that get lost, because they were doing the work on the daily. They were teachers, and they were doing the work day in, day out. [Al Blackstone] For me, it was all about Frank Hatchett. He was this incredible presence. He was really as much a motivator and a guru, I'd say, as much as he was a choreographer and a teacher, and he was one of the first people I think that, really, I understood about what style was. He had a style that he taught, he called it VOP, he created it himself, it sort of became the name of what he was teaching. I believe as a jazz dancer, it's our obligation to interpret the music, to communicate with the audience, it's an energy. Sometimes we have to sacrifice technique, but that's what VOP is, it's about flavoring the choreography. VOP, the initials mean nothing, it's a style. [Blackstone] He would combine, like, classic pas de bourrées and then he would get this sort of, like, very grounded sort of, like... almost the beginning, really, of what we call hip-hop now. And he was... combined styles in a way that was very fearless, and I think really excited people. Pas de bourrée, say hey. Hey. Say ho. Ho. He was really motivating, but he was also really fun, but he also had very, very high standards. I remember people would, you know, come into class, and they would stand in the front of the room, and if they didn't know what they were doing, Frank would ask you to move to the back, and he would ask you to move to the back of the room in front of the entire class. I mean, there was a really high standard of behavior. It's this environment that was simultaneously really fun and really energetic, but also really serious. People took this style seriously. You were in New York, you had technique, but you also had flavor, and you had style. And I think that he found a way to combine discipline of the technique with what was happening commercially in America and what was happening in the clubs and what was happening with music. I don't think the artists of today are doing enough to acknowledge our ancestors, the lineage of this art form, and the history of this dance. I think we need to talk about our ancestors, we need to talk about our inspirations, every class Not just the one time we get to sit down on film. We need to speak their names every day. If we continue to keep their memory, their spirit alive, through their dances, through their music, through their names, that evokes their spirit on a higher level and that's one of the most powerful things you can do as a human. [Durden] It's paying respects and honor to the elders. It's acknowledging that a group of people were here and they contributed to society, they contributed to what influenced you. And to be dismissive of that is to say that they weren't here. Because we go to these studios, we go to these universities, and you get one side of the picture, and there's a whole other side that y'all don't even know. They don't know about these people, you don't even know their names. I think part of what happens in the U.S. is this kind of consolidation of everything. It's like America as the melting pot, things kind of get absorbed so we stop identifying the thing that made it, and so it becomes this whole universal experience of dance. It's also because as Americans, we don't acknowledge the historical roots of lots of things, particularly those things in which African Americans have had a vital participatory role. [Durden] To see someone doing a dance but they have no relationship to the community and why it's being done, then it loses its authenticity, it becomes a movement that in the movement, there's authentic form and expression. But the meaning behind what you're doing is not the same. [DeFrantz] African-American creativity does get appropriated, it gets taken, and moved to somewhere where it never was before and dropped down to do a different kind of work, and then the people who created the form can't benefit from all of the things that might be available in this other space. On Broadway or Hollywood where there might be money or more work, or the possibility to live in a neighborhood where schools are good for children, like that's not available for the Black people who are developing these dance forms and these creative addresses. So, it's important to understand that this is a part of how jazz is formed. It's not gonna go away. It doesn't not exist just because we wish it didn't. This is what jazz is, too, it's part of it. I think people do have a genuine... Uh, I don't even know if I can say that word, but they have a respect for it. But I just think there's a lot of conversations to have as to how authentic you're doing... you're trying to hold o n to something. It might not be something for you to hold on to. I think it also wears a support for the community that this art form comes from, it's the people. And when people divide and take the dance away from the people, and say, "This dance is cool, but I don't wanna mess with you as a person," there's danger in that because now we're just appropriating these art forms for sale as opposed to appreciating the people that have brought these art forms out and getting the true meaning of what they're doing and what they're trying to say. [DeFrantz] The Civil Rights Movement is another challenging moment in American political history where dances start to shift yet again and they become even more weighty, so we're seeing a lot of fists, and things are getting just harder because the struggle for civil rights is also reflected in the social dances that we create. We are gonna walk non-violently and peacefully, to let the nation and the world know that we are tired now. We've lived with slavery and segregation 345 years. We waited a long time for freedom. We are trying to remind the nation of the urgency of the moment. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. ♪ Run from these demons ♪ ♪ Please don't give 'em a reason ♪ ♪ To spill blood on my sneakers ♪ ♪ So I just put my hand up ♪ Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight... ♪ ...put me in handcuffs ♪ ♪ They just scared 'cause they don't understand us ♪ ♪ Try to beat us down when we try to stand up ♪ ♪ I didn't even do nothin' ♪ [Muhammad Ali] You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You won't even stand up for me in America, for my religious beliefs and you want me to go somewhere and fight but you won't even stand up for me here at home. ♪ Oh, baby ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Just give me my freedom ♪ ♪ The beautiful ♪ ♪ America ♪ ♪ The murderer ♪ ♪ America ♪ ♪ The beautiful ♪ ♪ America ♪ ♪ God bless America ♪ [Durden] The '60s is kind of known as the Decade of Fire. We had a lot of assassinations, Women's Rights movement, Black Power movement. And so the music kind of reflected those times. The dances reflected the movement that was going on. So now the twist changes the social decorum. People are just dancing. They can do it by themselves, a woman doesn't have to wait for a man to ask her to dance [Dr. Faison] We were seeing all sorts of different attitudes. And people were coming out of, or falling out of, all kind of closets. You know what I mean? So the world was different. People were different. We were living and it was everything out there. Drugs and sex and rock 'n' roll, and that other beat. There it was, it was jazz back there on the dance floor again. You know, taking us into another era. In the '70s, the streets were buzzing, the clubs were buzzing, dance was everywhere, and dance wasn't just something you had to train for, dance was something you could create whether it was from the streets of hip-hop or breaking or in the discos. And it was wild. Hip-hop is the culture that has come right out of our community. It's a culture, It's not just a music style or dance style, it's a culture. Hip-hop is a derivative of jazz. And so the root of it is coming from jazz but it's the street, it's the common dance. I call it the common dance of jazz today. Most of the characteristics defined with hip-hop culture are closely connected to the roots, the identifiable characteristics of African traditional dance. [Brown] Each generation has a time when you're looking at the politics around you and you're responding to it. That was part of the creation of hip-hop, people finding their voices. [Durden] Pretty much every hip-hop dance you see, I can show you footage of that same step from the jazz era. Some of the movement that you see breakers do was part of what was considered eccentric dancing in the jazz era. A lot of that was seen as comedic dancing. In 1921, Lupino Lane came out with a book, and in that book, they illustrate how to do moves that breakers do right now. So, we can see that none of this stuff is new and they say nothing is new under the sun, the only thing that might be new is how you put your twist on it. But there's a lineage to this movement that we need to excavate to really understand its socio-cultural significance. And these are steps that go back to the 1800s, some of them. And so there's a progression that happens in the community that we don't see on the stage. So, Lindy Hop didn't die, it transitioned into some other movements for the next generation. So you have Lindy Hoppers today saying, "Well, the African Americans, they dropped it." You can't drop culture. You don't drop culture. But if you're not in that culture, you don't see how it morphs into the next thing. And so now, when I get around young students and they're turning their nose up at hip-hop. "Oh, no. I'm not taking hip-hop, that's not real dancing." And it's very interesting to me because we'll talk about African-American people who, "I have to have my natural hairstyle. I have to have the garb. I have to have the Black art On the wall. I need to read Langston Hughes." But when it comes to the dance and hip-hop is most tied to your cultural identity and heritage because of the structure how rooted it is in African dance. But that's not real dancing. And these elders have taught you to value this Eurocentric dance over what's most connected to your heritage. They don't get it. They're not doing it intentionally. They don't see it. [Guarino] Hip-hop, all of a sudden, you see it not danced to hip-hop music so we're removing it further and further from that culture of which it was born. And it might not have that connection to the place where in the '80s when people were using hip-hop as a way to work out their aggression and from a place of community. So now I see a lot of hip-hop dances where everyone is standing in straight lines and directed outward towards the audience and there's this disconnect and lack of community and they're not dancing to hip-hop music, yet they're calling it hip-hop. So we're having a lot of the same issues with these branches off of the jazz tree and who knows where they'll go. [Blackstone] A great jazz dancer is musical, has line, has a strong sense of self. A great jazz dancer isn't afraid to get dirty. A great jazz dancer isn't afraid to enjoy themselves. [Esse] It's those extra inches of feeling in movement that I think makes the most dynamic jazz dancer, somebody that doesn't just stop at the end of the line but continues to go on. [Mandy Moore] A great jazz dancer knows how to focus. They know how to get the audience to look at them and say, this is what I want. This is what I want you to look at. [Allen] It's like the great jazz musicians. There're a lot of people that can hit the notes but can they put it together, can they make gumbo with it, can they zhuzh it, can they make it hot? You know, that's jazz dancing. [Jerry Mitchell] I can teach you the steps, I can teach you the words, I can teach you the notes But what I can't teach you how to do is have passion If you can't bring passion to the room, why would anyone wanna watch you? In the '80s, dance was visible in a way that it isn't even visible now. It was, like, okay, now sex is back and we're gonna... we got MTV and music videos and it's hot. And, like, girls are killing it, with the guys strong, shirtless, you know. [George] There was so much dance happening in the '80s and '90s. And you would see the same dancers from video to video and then you just didn't see them anymore. And conventional wisdom would say, oh, it's because dancing in music videos fell out of vogue in the late '90s. But the reality also was, we were in the midst of an AIDS crisis. And so there's dancers who I saw in multiple videos who then just disappeared. [Mitchell] I was a dancer. Choreographers were dying left and right. There was no dance. Dance disappeared from Broadway not because the choreographers were dying, because dance is a sexual expression. Even when you don't want it to be sexual, it's sexual because we're using our bodies to tell a story. So people were afraid. And that form of expression was left alone for a while. [George] AIDS took out all of these men and it took them out primarily between the ages of 23 and 45. And when you think about who we are as artists and when we hit, like, our prime, when we really like figure out what it is we wanna do. Thirty-five and forty-five, that's when people really, really lock in and we just don't have those voices, so it changed the trajectory in ways that I don't know that we can really name because, certainly, work was still getting made, you know. Uh, but, you know, a chunk of the creative team that created A Chorus Line is gone. I got to where I am on the backs of a lot of people who are no longer with us. So, when I really started to teach in New York, that was during the AIDS crisis. So the young gentlemen who were teaching jazz all over New York disappeared. Those people that we lost, we lost a whole connection the things that would have informed theater. God, who knows what we would have been doing now had those people not died. Sometimes I look at the work of the '80s and as much as it feels sexual and propulsive and dynamic, there's times it also feels really desperate, because people were dancing for their lives. And many of them couldn't talk about it. It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking because... we'll never know what they could have done, we'll never know how that work could have changed our lives, how that work would have changed the world. Spread the toes, plié, rolling up. Pressing the whole foot into the floor, feeling very rooted. Stand tall. To first position. [George] I started noticing it in the '90s, the repertoire of jazz companies was changing dramatically. Two, regular. It's slow. I know. I changed it. What happened was a huge shift to modern and contemporary. Body roll. There was nothing going on, I mean, you could barely get a job as a jazz dancer. Plié, roll it out. [George] But then a few years go by, five, six years, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Darrin's Dance Grooves. Because it's always cyclical, there's always an ebb and a flow to what's happening. And so, even if you don't see jazz prominent right now, just wait because it's always gonna be there. There's something about jazz that feels almost like everyman meets magnified dancer. You know, there's some things about jazz dancing that I think can feel common to someone who doesn't know how to dance. It feels right when you watch it, where sometimes things like ballet can feel a little elitist. [Simonson] And because it was not elitist, it was not "classical ballet," opera, the symphony, it was looked down upon. [Knight] There are certain areas of dance because that are much more well-funded and understood because their values fall in alignment with the values of the people who have the dollars. And so, unfortunately, jazz, hip-hop, tap, they're looked at as the other forms. [Boross] Jazz has been told not to be jazz. Jazz is now lately considered to be a liability [Walker] I was told, "If you would put contemporary in front of it, I could help you out." But I couldn't do that. If you're gonna go and talk about jazz dance, you don't wanna put contemporary in front of it. Jazz should stand by itself, but there's no funding. [Drew McOnie] To say there's more room in the industry for jazz companies is like... I mean, of course there is, there's so few of them. You know, if you think about how saturated the world is with ballet companies and contemporary companies that... And there is... I promise you, there is the wealth of talent out there to fill hundreds of jazz companies. To make a career in dance, to make a career here in New York City, versatility is everything. You have to do everything. You must be a great jazz dancer. You must have great ballet technique. You need to be a tap dancer. You should be great at flamenco and hip-hop. And you should sing. You know, it's a lot. There's a lot. I think that what's happening in New York now is that people are taking theater classes because they wanna do theater because that's how they can make money. [George] A friend of mine calls it "get a job jazz." Training people how to actually work in the field, which means commercial work or theatrical work. Jazz as a technique is really how you become great at doing the kind of choreography that you see in theater today. The practice, or the way it is taught, is only from a commercial point of view. We very rarely go back and we look at the history, the lineage, what makes jazz what it is, what is the aesthetic. And so, the aesthetic has changed so much that we don't recognize it today. [Murray] Sometimes we think of jazz dance as permanently being in peril, but if you look at those popular dance shows on television, there are serious choreographers on those shows that are introducing jazz to a really broad audience. Dance is becoming more accessible to the masses. It's giving them inspiration and it's getting new people started dancing. I worry that it's all become a little bit tricksy, that if you can do a backflip, you're therefore a jazz dancer. No, you're not. Look at this competition crap. It's how many pirouettes can I do? How can I expose my crotch in a different way? It's not about moving anybody. [Simonson] It becomes trick-oriented and that's what the everyday person is seeing on television and they're going, "Wow." And we're going, "No, that's just tricks. There's no heart." But there are people looking at dance now, so flip it to the other side, who've never considered looking at dance. So, there's a gift in that also. But I think that, you know, we're relying on those young dancers to know the amount of work that goes in to be able to perform to that level. And if it can be used as an inspiration, it's brilliant. If it's used to make you lazy, then we're in trouble. [Culbreath] They do step right off the bus, they have an agent and Twitter followers, and a YouTube blog, and a thing, and a thing and a thing, and all that stuff is just a bunch of horseshit in the way to the work. Just do the work, but they need somebody to guide them in the proper way to do the work and ask more of them than they think they can do. Then you go. This flight, this flight, stop. Going to take it again. Five, six, seven... [Bergman] Class, as a dancer, is a place to fall on your face. What happened started to change when all this convention dancing started and it all became about competition. And I think as a young person, as a young dancer, it's a place to fail. It's a place to fall down and get back up again, and learn how to do something better. Don't be the... don't focus so much. [Chita Rivera] It's not easy. Dance! But anything that's good is not easy. If you wanna keep it, you know. If you want it to be a part of you, then it's got to be drilled into you. You have to keep up with your training. I think no matter what, you can never stop learning. Um, your body is your tool, and you have to maintain that tool and you have to continue to keep learning and training. Most of us, you know, we spent hours, blood, sweat and tears, in a dance class. Back, back, back, forward... Doing eight shows a week, folks, ain't fun. It's really tough. To make that kind of commitment, get one day off a week, and in the theater, you get two weeks off a year and you work every holiday. Yes. Isabelle, yes! The theater, the dance world, it is difficult. Ready? Six. And so, I think for you to survive, you have got to love it more than anything else in the world. Keep them still, keep them still. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. [Andrew Wright] I went to a college to teach and brought up some elements of dance history, and I was met with absolute blank faces. I don't understand that. If it's gonna be your job, and your livelihood, and your passion, why don't you know the history of it? And especially today, with the Internet, you can find anything out within seconds. [Tom Ralabate] I think it's important for studio teachers to constantly sprinkle information to their students. You can teach a Shorty George, okay, a vernacular movement. But you best, while you're teaching that movement, Shorty George, mention that George Snowden was the originator of this movement and that it happened at a place Lindy Hoppers would gather together. All you're doing is just sprinkling information while they're learning it. Okay? All right. Good enough? Four times, right side, - Left side, right side, left side. We as dancers have been mentored. We have a responsibility to do the same. We're all kind of vessels, aren't we, and taking into the dance studio our knowledge and what we know, and then you don't realize you're impacting the next generation. [Boross] There's a lack of curiosity about jazz, about what it is, about what its relation to our history is. I mean, jazz is the history of America, pure and simple. [Smith] It's the American voice that has allowed so many people in oppressed situations to speak. And that's a beautiful thing. If dance can do that too, man, that's an empowering tool that we should never take away from our children, never take out of schools, as we have been doing. We should implement it more into our educational system. [George] We're not having a dialog in the jazz dance field. Part of it is, is that the concert people are sort of conflicted about the relationship to the contemporary people. And the contemporary people and the swing people have no relationship. But what I do know is the urban dance community and the tap community have figured out how to always stay in dialog with each other regardless of the different schools. And the jazz community does not know how to do that and it's tragic, and it's why we're in this place that we're at right now, where we're trying to still, like, claw and claim because we don't communicate. ♪ Everything must change ♪ [Knight] I think jazz is in a place of flux at the moment. There's a little bit of confusion about whether or not it's necessary or whether it's relevant. ♪ ...remains the same ♪ We are in transition. I don't know where this is gonna go, but we have arrived nowhere. This is all shifting. ♪ No one and nothing remains the same ♪ I would never profess to tell you how to dance if that's what you wanna do and I would celebrate what you do. It may not be what I wanna do. And I think that's where we get into a bit of controversy, when people become such purists that they think they own a certain style or a certain technique and that it can't evolve. Well, the world is built, the universe is built, on change. And if nothing changes, it is stagnant, it is not alive. ♪ Nothing, no one remains unchanged ♪ [DeFrantz] I think the future of jazz dance is very promising. I think we should continue to work on reclaiming its roots, but still embracing the hybrids that are happening right in front of us. I think it's gonna create a lot of debate, but that's what jazz dance is. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Except ♪ ♪ Rain comes from the clouds ♪ [Allen] I think to go forward, you have to look back and you have to know the history and references. ♪ And hummingbirds... ♪ I think there's a beautiful weight and responsibility to being a jazz dancer because there are so few of us and because the history is complicated and born of finding joy in suffering. And so, if you're going to represent that history, you have to know where it came from. I met... Okay. I met John Travolta at a party once. This is... I'm gonna tell you this. And I brought up the nerve, you know, got up the nerve to go over to him, I'm just like, "Don't be a nerd. Don't be a nerd. No, don't be a nerd." And I said to him, "Hey, John, my name is Mandy Moore. I'm a choreographer. I just wanna let you know that Staying Alive was honestly one of my favorite films ever." And he goes, "Wait, the one where I was a jazz dancer?" And I was like, "Yeah. It was my favorite film." And he's like... I think he was weirded out by it because of course the man's done, like, so many other films that are, like, so much more, you know, probably more successful or whatever, but I just thought it's so funny the way he, like, he had this disdain for, like, "Wait, the one where I was the jazz dancer?" I was thinking, "Yes, the one where you're the jazz dancer. That's why I'm a jazz dancer." I have no idea how old I am. It's the truth. What?! I mean, should we go to the next question? Is that it? I mean, can you edit that? Like, one of the best things ever and he's, like, "Jump!" And she's, like, "I can't!" And then she, like, leaps in her red tights with the red leotard. I mean, it was over for me. Like that... from that point forward, jazz. That's it. That's all I'm doing. That's okay. Ahem. Try it now? Oh, yeah, I'm just stretching. You might not wanna put that in the movie.
