(birds chirping) (narrator) Wife battering is threatening to become an epidemic in the United States. According to recent studies, there are from 26 million to 30 million abused wives in the country today. This is Janice Halston. (flower pot falls) Oh, no. (narrator) She could be one of them. (children) Mom, Mom, where are you? (Janice) In the kitchen! Mommy, Mommy! Guess what? Mommy, guess what? Dad picked us up from school today and you won't believe what we got. What? We're gonna use it for vacation and everything. What is it? (Janice) What? (girl) Mom, look, look! (man) Hey, honey. What do you think, huh? Here, Chris. Hold this for me. Donny, you never said anything about buying a-- I could get this thing for an absolute steal. Here, Chris, take this in the house for Dad, will you? Thank you, pal. Come on, take a look. Remember Claude? Yeah? The guy who runs a camera store? Yeah. Well, Ol' Claud just has to come up with some fast cash. Look, Mom, here's a table that we can all sit around, and Daddy says we're gonna go to Canada in this, right? Right. Well, still, it looks awfully expensive. Are you sure we can afford it? Afford it? Huh. Why don't you just leave that to the ol' bread winner here, huh? Right, Peggy? Yeah! Let's go! Well, did something happen? I'll tell you later. Come on, let's go for a test drive. You go, honey-- Come on, the plants are just gonna have to wait! Honey, put me down. Put me down. (Peggy) Watch out. Be careful! Oh, be careful! (Chris) Don't drop her, Dad! Hey, Dad, Dad, can I drive to my friend Marc's house? All right, kids, I guess I'm going for a ride. (engine starts) (all) * There was an old lady who swallowed a fly * * I don't know why she swallowed a fly * * Perhaps she'll die * * There was an old lady who swallowed a spider * * That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her * * She swallowed the spider to catch the fly * * I don't know why she swallowed the fly ** All right, everybody who doesn't sing, in back of the camper, right? All right. * There was an old lady who swallowed a bird * * How absurd to swallow a bird * * She swallowed the bird to catch the spider * * That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her * * She swallowed the spider to catch the fly * * I don't know why she swallowed the fly * * Perhaps she'll die * * There was an old lady who swallowed a goat * * She opened her throat and swallowed a goat * * She swallowed a goat to catch the dog * (Janice) * What a hog to catch a dog * * She swallowed a dog to catch the cat * * Imagine that she swallowed a cat * * She swallowed a cat to catch the bird * * How absurd to swallow a bird * * She swallowed a bird to catch the spider * * That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her * * She swallowed the spider to catch the fly * * I don't know why she swallowed a fly * * Perhaps she'll die ** ** Honey, I'm gonna run up the canyon and see where the kids have gone. Donny, don't go. Why? Well, I wanna talk to you about something. What? I still don't understand how-- Honey... this camper is my department. If I say that I can handle it, I can handle it. We can save money by buying this. How? Well, I got a three-week vacation coming up, right? We just pile the kids in the camper and take off. Look at all the money we'll save on motels and restaurants. Donny, there's only one bed in there. Oh, no. No, no. No, the big one over the cab, that's for us. The kids' bed pulls down here, out of the wall, right over the table. Oh, I didn't know that was there. There's plenty of room. Oh, honey, you think of everything. Um... You wanna go inside and see if our bed is comfortable? (laughs) Oh, you crazy, mixed up kid. We're in a public place here. We could get arrested for reckless parking or something. We're consenting adults, aren't we? (sighs) Oh, Donny. What do I have to do? Get on some sort of waiting list? Hey, come on. That's kinda hitting below the belt, isn't it? It's just that recently I've-- I know. You've been under a lot of pressure. Janice... you know I love you, hmm? Still? I always will. ** I didn't pull you away from TV, did I? Oh, I'm sorry. I just had to call you and tell you about-- about the camper. I'm gonna take it! Would you mind going over those figures for me just, uh, one more time? Honey, is there a pencil there? Hold on a minute, will you, Claude? Pencil, will you please, honey? Thank you. Okay, shoot. Right. Right. Well, I spoke to the bank this morning about the financing. There's no problem there. Oh. Thank you. Uh, you remember the client that I was telling you about, the one that I've been romancing for the past month? That was right, the doctor. Caullier. Well, I think that he's going to spring loose for the entire package. You sell that camper to anybody else, old buddy, and I'm going to break all 12 of your fingers. Right. Right. I'll talk to ya. Hey, babe, why so glum? Didn't you hear? I can afford ten campers if I want, and a cliff to push 'em over when they get dirty. Donny, it would be nice if just once in a while you would tell me something first before you told all your friends. Aw, now what do you wanna hear that for? That's man talk. Right? Besides, I got other plans for you. Oh, yeah? Like what? (chuckles) (Peggy) Mom, he hit me! (Chris) She stuck her finger in my cereal. (Peggy) You started it. Okay, kids, cool it. Ma, can we go to school in the camper today? No, only Dad can drive the camper. Aw, why can't you drive it? Are you two finished? Ready to go? Okay, Peggy, put this money someplace where you won't lose it. Okay, get your books. Don't forget your lunch, Peggy. Come on, come on. (phone rings) Oh, shoot, now we are gonna be late. Kids, get in the car. Hello. No, I'm afraid he's just left. May I tell him who called? Oh, hi, Dr. Caullier, yes. Oh, I'm sure you could reach him at the office anytime this morning, but could I give him a message? Oh. Oh, I see. All right, thank you. Good-bye. Take a look at that Fenton kid. I bet he sees more action than Starsky and Hutch put together. Never mind the girls, take a look at his desk. Twenty-five years old and it's as clean as a vice president's. How can you sell insurance when there's nothing on your desk? Hey, hey, look. Larry's telling him how you tied down the Caullier deal. Now let's see how much class he's got. Hey, five bucks says that he only used it to remind us of what a hotshot he is. You're on. I'll hold it. Hello, Mort, Don. How things doing in the old-folks section? Creakin' along, Rusty. Creakin' along. Hey, I hear you landed a big one. Half a mil? Oh, just a start. I should triple it by the end of the month. No kidding? Congratulations. Have I shown you guys my certificate? Just had her framed, third in national sales last month, signed by-- I know! Signed by Chairman of the Board of Philadelphia. The Chairman of the Board signed it. Ah, would you look at all the money! Guys, gals, it's coffee-break time. Donald's buying. You just can't wait to start spending that commission. (phone rings) Hey, you don't wanna mess up your desk with that, Rusty. Somebody might think you work here. (Donny) Hello, doctor. Oh, really? You coming, champ? Excuse me. No, I'm not coming. Just go on. I don't know how a man expects to sell insurance if he's not friendly. Look, doctor, if I could just go over those figures with you one more time, I'm certain that-- Yes. Uh-huh. Doctor, uh, you have no idea how important this is. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I understand that it's not your-- Yes, sir. No. Donald? Hmm? I know what's bothering you. Me? Dr. Caullier called here this morning, just after you left. That's fine. Well, would you like to talk about it? Janice, if you got any sense, you'll leave me alone tonight. I know you lost the policy. I know that's what's upsetting you. Well, you're wrong. What's upsetting me is that you've overdrawn the checking account again. I did? Unbelievable. This is the second time this month. I'm sorry, Donald. You're sorry? That's terrific. I'm the one that got the call from the vice president, and I'm the one that's gonna have to go down there and straighten out this mess. Do you have any idea how embarrassing that is? Huh? There's not gonna be any commission from the Caullier sale, is there? That's right. There's no commission. Then, are you gonna call? Well, go on. Go on, say it. I mean, get it out. You'd really love that, wouldn't you? You'd love it if I had to call up Claude and cry to him now that I can't afford the camper. Well then, would you like to tell me just where that money is gonna come-- I don't have to tell you a damn thing, nothing! Shh! The kids will wake up. They're gonna hear you. I work my whole lousy life, and finally, finally I get something for me, and the first thing you want me to do is to give it back. It's not only the stupid camper either. It's everything. You never miss an opportunity to mess up my life. Can't even balance out a check book. You can't even make out a grocery list. You can't even leave a pencil by a telephone. And I've asked you to do it. How many times have I said, "Just please, leave a pencil by the telephone." Well, maybe if I knew how much money we were gonna have every week! What did you say? What? Janice? Janice! Janice, don't you walk away from me! (screams) You burned yourself. Here, let me-- Hey. You don't think that-- You don't believe that I did this on purpose, do you? Janice, I gave you my word that it wouldn't happen again. I haven't laid a hand on you in months, have I? Well, then it was just a crazy accident. You must've slipped on something. Here. Come on. Let me help you up, please. What are you thinking, hmm? That I wish you wouldn't drive yourself so hard. Well, it's just that I want a lot for us. Is that wrong? No. Time is going by so fast. There's plenty of time, Donny. How long am I supposed to wait to start enjoying life? Like my father, till it's too late? We've got the kids. We've got each other. That's all that's important, isn't it? We don't have to go into debt to be happy. Well, I just want my kids to have a childhood that they can feel good about, that's all. Because you didn't? I don't know. Who knows? Maybe. Donny? Hmm? If you still think we can manage the camper-- But of course we can. That Caullier cad is not the only thing I've got going. Really? Ask Mort. Ask anybody. I got more experience than anybody in the office. That's gotta count for something. Then you do what you think is best, Donny. I know that I've been a little tough to live with lately. I know that. But it's... that I wanna make things good for us. I know. ** (car starts) (crack) Jan? I looked in the rearview mirror. I was sure no one was behind me. Janice, it's me. It's Karen Renshaw. Karen! (laughs) Imagine running into you. I thought you were living in Florida. I was. I was living in Florida. What are you doing back here? Listen, let's get our tin out of the road, huh? Oh, wow, am I in trouble. Oh, listen, we ran into each other. What do you got insurance for? Right. Have I got insurance. Donald is in the insurance business. Oh, Donald. The centerfold from "Seventeen" magazine. How is Donald? He's fine. We're very happy. Really, we are. Did I say you weren't happy? Just Donald's not gonna be very happy about the car. Don't worry about it. I was dating a guy a while back. He runs a garage. Dating? Divorced person. Oh, I hadn't heard. Yeah. Listen, my office is three blocks away from here. Follow me over there. We'll call him, okay? Okay. (Karen) So the kids found a school term with Jerry and then they're here with me for the summer. Well, hey, they're still my kids. Jerry loves them just as much as I do. Anyway, I gotta right to put my life together. Thank you. Here we be. Give me one minute and I'll get this guy on the phone. So what is it that you do here, Karen? Are you a secretary or what? I'm a drafts woman. Jan, they don't actually require that I smoke cigars and wear boxer shorts. Uh, Jimmy? Hi. Karen. Listen, I just bumped into an old friend. Yeah. No, no, she didn't think it was funny either. Can you see her for me? Oh, you're terrific. Terrific, okay. I never thought either one of us would end up doing anything like this. Listen, this is just the beginning for me. After I put in six years here and a couple of night courses, I get my degree as an architect. Hey, you know what? I'm really impressed. Ah, well, I got tired of working in kitchens designed by a man who don't know bread boards from ironing boards. Uh, look, love, I've got a meeting to go into, but I'm gonna have a bunch of people up to the house in a few weeks, and I'll give you and Donald a call. I'd love to, but Donald doesn't seem to care much for parties these days. Wait a minute, you sure we're talking about the same Donald Halston? I'm sure. You tell Donald Halston I don't care if he is bald and old and fat, I wanna see him. (laughs) Okay. I'm calling you. All right. Bye. Bye. (loud chatter) What's with young Fenton there? Did he get another certificate from the president? Oh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, Donald, but that little punk has been chosen Training Supervisor. You're kidding. Yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. You all right? Yeah, sure. Okay, here he comes. I'll tell you what, you trip him and I'll drop him lightly on his ear. Hey! Nice going there, old buddy! I'd like to congratulate you on your new position. Well, thank you very much. Listen, somebody said that you had your eye on that job. Is that so? Are you serious? Spend my time teaching kids to sell insurance? I think I'd rather run a nursery school. Well, for 5% override on what they sell, I think I can afford to wipe a few noses. I'll see ya. Mort? Who do you have to poison to get out of this business? Hmm? (chuckles) We can always start with ourselves. Think it's too early to start drinking to fearless Fenton's bad health? Maybe another time. Aw, come on. You don't wanna take this home with you. We'll go out and have some laughs. Let's go. Hey, come on. Come on! (smooth jazz playing) (Mort) You know what we ought to do, you and me? We ought to start our own insurance company. I think I'd rather start a hog farm. No, really. Seriously. Oh, and to keep the aggravation to a minimum, we'll have a big sign that says "Halston and Burns Limited" and underneath, it says "no customers wanted." (chuckles) That's the kind of sales campaign I could really get behind. Yeah, and we'll sit in these big leather chairs behind this huge mahogany desk and we'll eat pizza and drink beer all day, hmm? Hmm. What's the matter? You know, you get to a certain age, you just, you gotta start taking care of the ol' bod. You gotta start laying off all that junk food. Are you kidding? That's the only thing Marilyn can cook. I bet if I ate a carrot, my body would go into instant vitamin shock. And the booze. You ought to swear off of this stuff. I'll drink to that. No, I mean it, really. You know, I've been planning on starting to work out again. You wanna go with me over to the park, huh? We'll jog around a track a little and shoot a few baskets? Make you feel good. What do you say? I say we ought to have another painkiller and discuss it rationally. Not a bad idea. All right. Wait a minute. It's kind of late. Maybe we ought to go home. Okay, we'll put in a hand of the gods. Heads, we go home. Tails, we order up another round. Heads. Wanna make it two out of three? Come on, what do you say? One for the road. I'll call Janice and tell her I'll be a little late. I owe you a dime. Make it a nickel. Tell yours to call mine. (indistinct chatter) Come over here. (Mort) Don, don't just stand there. I got a couple of friends who wanna meet you. Uh... I'd just like to introduce you to a very good friend of mine. Miss, miss, we have a couple of drinks at the bar, and what would you want? Vodka on the rocks. Two vodka on the rocks? Two vodka on the rocks and just bring them over. Thanks, thanks. This is Sandy, and this is Merna, and this is my best friend, Rusty Fenton. He's a manure salesman. (all laugh) (Donny) That's right, that's right. I was third in national sales last month, 27 box cars full. That's a lot of bull. (all laugh) (Mort) Did I tell you? Oh, come on, you gotta be kidding about what he sells. No, no, no, listen. I've got a gold shovel to prove it. Signed by Chairman of the Board. Wanna see it? Well, I do because I do not believe that you have any such gold shovel. Oh, no, no, no, he's not kidding, really. But the only trouble is it's in his room over at the Mayflower Motel. Well then? Let's go. I wanna powder my nose first, okay? Okay. I'll go with you. (Mort) We'll be waiting. We'll be back. Hold the drink, huh? Will you hold the drink? Thanks. You see the way that little brunette is looking at you? If you were a piece of chocolate cake, you'd be all over her face by now. I think you're right. Hmm? So what's the problem? Hey, you know, Mort, the whole time I've been married, I gotta tell you that I've just never, you know. I believe you. It shows? Yeah, it shows. It may seem a little bit square, but it's not that I haven't thought about it from time to time, you know. It's just that for me, it didn't seem the way to-- huh. Look, Donald, where's that attitude ever gotten you? I mean, are you richer? Are you smarter? Better looking? Are you just gonna wait around until all of your vital juices dry up forever? Hey, come on. Here they come. Let's go. He's quite a kidder. My friend Mort, huh? Yes, he is. Actually, I'm in insurance. Oh, sounds like very interesting work. Well, it has its compensation. That was a little joke there-- insurance compensation. I guess we can leave that alone. Well? So what do you do? You work? Or, you know, are you a stewardess or a nurse? Do you really need to know? Well, I-- I just... Now, you just ease up. I'm not going to bite you. I've, uh... I've gotta tell you the truth. My name is not Rusty Fenton. I never thought that it was. You didn't? How come? Because you don't look rusty to me. Listen, I'm married. I got two kids. I got a house with a mortgage that won't be paid off till March the 1st in the year 2005. Well, I guess that I can live with that. If you really wanna know the truth, I've just had a rotten day. You think you're getting someplace in this life, you know what I mean? And you're very careful to play everything by the rules. And then, you stop just for a moment to catch your breath, and then some 25-year-old whiz kid, he, phew, runs you off the road. Now listen to me, love. If I wanted to hear what a tough day somebody had, I would've gone home. ** (door opens, then closes) What the hell happened to the car out there? Don't give me your silent treatment. I asked you a question, lady. I made dinner. It's still on the warmer. Have any idea how much that's gonna cost? And don't talk to me about insurance. We've got a hundred-dollar deductible. You come waltzing in here after 2:00 in the morning, smelling like a bar rag, and you try to turn it back on me? Where were you? With Mort? I really don't think you wanna know where I was. You could've at least phoned me. You could've done that! Or maybe you were busy with Dr. Caullier, writing up another half-million-dollar policy. All right. All right. You want to know where I was? I'll tell you where I was. I picked up a woman in a bar and I took her to a motel. That's where I was! I don't believe you. Well, you damn well better believe me! And you better know why, because you drove me to it with your nagging and your complaining! You're giving me no support! Well then... Well then, what?! Get it out! Well then, you just go back to that motel and spend the whole night with her, because you sure haven't been winning any prizes in bed around here! Why you-- No, Donny! (loud thud) (Janice screams) (loud smack) Donny, no! Don't talk to me like that, you! Donny! No, Donny, stop! Gonna keep your mouth shut! You're gonna keep it shut! Answer me! Answer me! Donny, stop! (both shouting) Are you gonna talk to me that way again? Huh? Are ya? (Janice cries) No! (Donny shouts, Janice screams) (Janice) Donny, stop! (crickets chirping) (officer) All right, folks, come on, clear it out. Go home. (knocks) Yeah? Police! Open up. (crying) (whispers) It's the police. Okay! (crying) (knocks) Yeah! We had a call from one of your neighbors that there was a disturbance here. Anything wrong? Well... (scoffs) Had a little family argument, raised our voices maybe a little bit. It's all settled now. Okay, sorry to have bothered you. Uh, may we talk to your wife, Mr...? Halston. Donald Halston. I, uh... I'm afraid she's already gone to bed. We'd like to have a look at her, if you don't mind, sir, for our report. Come in. Janice! Janice! Ja-- Wanna tell us what happened, ma'am? Come and sit down. Would you tell us exactly what happened, please? I fell. I tripped on the stair and hit my head on-- You sure about that, ma'am? Because if anybody put a hand on you, we can take him downtown. Lady, that's our job. You don't have to be afraid. Just say that you're willing to swear out a warrant and we'll take it from there. I tripped. That's all that happened. All right, good. Let's go. (sobbing) I mean, I think I could've talked her into filing a complaint. Look, I've had two partners of mine caught up already in these family things. I know, I know. All right, all right, you wanna go back in there, you go ahead. But the only one that's gonna get hurt is you, old buddy. Besides, a good punching around is what some of these women need to turn them on. Now, you take those two in there. They're most likely kissing and making up right this minute. Let's go. (Janice sniffles) Here. Some ice. (sniffles) I'm-- I'm really, really sorry. Really. (sniffles) I don't know what happened. It just, uh, this time, you just made me so mad, I didn't know what I was doing. I'll make it up to you. Let's go to bed, Janice. Come on. Come on. All right. If that's the way you feel about it. Peggy, honey, what are you doing home from school? I didn't feel good. I threw up. Well, did you go see the nurse? Why didn't the office call me? I don't know. I guess they forgot. Peggy, honey, why are you lying to me? Peggy? You lied to me. You said you fell down and that's how you hurt your face. Why does Daddy hit you? Did you do something bad? Is that why he hurt you? Well, yes, honey. In a way. I did overdraw the checking account and I banged up the car, but that doesn't mean-- Are you and Daddy gonna get a divorce? Oh, honey, don't you worry about that. Of course your daddy and I are gonna stay together. It's just that sometimes he loses his temper, but he's always sorry afterward. Do you still love him? He was the first man I ever loved, and the only one. Oh, baby... if you only could've known your daddy when I first met him. He was so sweet, and he was so strong, and his head was full of the most wonderful dreams. And he could've had any girl he wanted, but he picked me. You know, he said that if I'd married him, that he'd buy me a castle, and that we would live on strawberry milkshakes. (Peggy laughs) And that he'd always take care of me. But now he hits you. Well, honey, right now your daddy is going through a hard time. But things are gonna be good again soon. You'll see. (crowd laughs) (Mort) No, really, she goes on like that, see, for what, half an hour or more, like, "Where were you until 2:00 in the morning?" "Why didn't you call?" How would I like it if she went catting around town all the time like I did? So you know what I finally told her? I said, "Marilyn, believe me, "if you keep this up, believe me, "one of these days it's gonna be pow, right in the old kisser" No, I told her that. Oh, God, you guys are really disgusting. Listen, I gotta get to work, you guys. Come on, we're gonna get in trouble, huh? What do you got? Wait, don't tell me, don't tell me. It's a present for Janice, to ease the old guilty conscience, right?. No, no, this is the day I go out and see my father. Hey, while you're out there, why don't you sell him some insurance? We can use the business. (man) Donald, could I speak to you for a minute? Yeah, sure, Bob. Are you off to see a client, are you? Sort of. Good, good. That's good. Listen, I have a few leads here that look promising. I thought you might like to follow them up. Hmm. You know, Bob, you don't have to keep propping me up. If I'm not doing a job, why don't you just say so? Hey, what are you getting so touchy about? Everybody has a bad month. Or two? Or three? It happens. My commission is not going to equal my advance again this month, right? You been with the company a long time, Donald. You've got credit here. Uh, we know you put a lot of work in on the Caullier thing. Obviously not enough. Caullier thought about what he was getting into and he panicked. He had an attack of buyer's remorse and he backed out of it. You know, that's the way it goes sometimes. You know that. He's not supposed to panic. He's not supposed to know what he wants or what he doesn't want. He's supposed to have some confidence in the man that he's working with. Why are you so tough on yourself? Would you have let this one get away? Would Fenton? He's got the killer instinct, Donald. Not too many of us are blessed with it. Look, I happen to know that you worked past 10:00 three nights last week. When's the last time you put your kids to bed, hmm? I wanna tell you something, Bob. I work for you, but that doesn't give you the right to do a time-and-motion study on my family life. I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- Do me a favor, will you? Just give this to one of the new guys. I've always been able to do just fine on my own. Dad! I gotta go. My son's here. Ben. Take my place, will you? Well, Donald, one of these days, you're gonna be on time and I can throw away my watch. Sorry, Dad. I had to stop by and see a couple of clients. This proves my point, don't it? What point? I've been telling you for years, you've gotta go into business for yourself. Otherwise, you're nothing, just a wage slave. Yeah. I got a little something for you. When are you gonna stop spending your life making other people rich? Well, I think maybe I already have. What's that supposed to mean? Oh nothing, nothing. Here. Wanna open it, see what's in the box? I saw this in Seattle the last time that I was up there. Reminded me of the one you lost the summer we went to Yellowstone, remember? Too big. No, no, here. Here, try it on. No, I was very careful to make sure that I got the right size. It'll fit. There. How's that, huh? That's perfect. Too big. Well, take it off. I'll send it back. Ah, never mind. I'll keep it. A place like this doesn't make any difference anyway. Nobody here I need to impress. I thought you said you liked it here. The food was good. You've met some new friends. Well, we all make mistakes. Even you and God? Is that supposed to be some kind of joke, young man? No, no, Dad. I'm sorry. It's just that I hope that you're not thinking about moving again. Well, why don't you just leave that to me? If I need your advice, I'll ask for it. Yes, sir. Now then, you tell me. What's bothering you? Nothing. You've been dragging your face in the ground ever since you got here. What is it? Don't you think that's a little bit of an over-exaggeration? I just got here. Don't argue with me. I can tell. What is it? Janice? You and Janice fighting? No, Janice and I are getting along just fine. Money then? You need a few dollars? Look, Dad, I-- I really appreciate the offer, but believe me, I'm in great shape, really. Well, you keep it in mind, you hear? I don't want anybody to think a son of mine has to go around begging. Mr. Halston! Yeah, what do you want? Not you, sir, your son. Excuse me. Good day, Mr. Simpson. I don't like to have to remind people this sort of thing, but this is the second month we haven't had a payment from you. Well, I'm sure I put a check in the mail to you. You didn't get it? Your father seems to be getting along quite well here, but we do have a rather long waiting list. It would be a shame to have to ask you to move him out. Well, I'll take care of it right away. Two days at the most. (Mr. Halston) Donald! Did you come to see him or me? What are you talking to that idiot about? He's a pain in the neck. (woman) Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12 and rest. All right, thank you for coming, ladies. See you next time. (ragtime music playing) (Janice) I didn't figure I'd see you down here, Marilyn. I thought your membership ran out. Oh, Mort renewed it for my birthday present. Isn't that sweet? Yeah. Says if I lose a pound a week for the next three years, he's gonna buy me a facelift and a Paris divorce. Say, what time did Donald finally get home last Thursday night? Oh, not late, just a few minutes after you called. And Mort, too. Thank you, Bridget. (showers running) Thanks. Excuse me, Mrs. Burns. I know it's not my place to ask, but is Mrs. Halston feeling all right? Gee, I suppose so. My guess is that, uh, she's suffering from a slight case of late-night husband. First time is always the toughest. You know what I mean? Yes, I do. She'll get over it. You know, I was saying to Mort, how come we all don't get together? How come I don't ever see more of you and Donald? We'll do it soon. How come you're so modest all of a sudden? We're all girls. No reason. Ready to take some steam? Mmm, just grab a shower. I'll meet you back here. Oh, my God, what's all that? It's from my car accident the other day. Remember I told you? Yeah, you said you just banged the fender and hit your head. Well, I got tossed around a lot, and I bruise easy. I'll say. Well, what else would you think it was? Meet you back here later. (keys jingling) (woman) Mrs. Halston. Forgive me for saying so, but I don't believe you got those bruises from a car accident. And I didn't hear anybody ask you what you thought. May I have that, please? Look, I know how you feel. Like, like this is something that's only happening to you, and if you told anyone about it, they'd think you were some kind of a freak. I don't want to talk about it. Please. Whoever it is that's doing this to you-- your husband, your boyfriend, whoever it is, he isn't gonna stop. You can kid yourself. You can tell yourself he will stop, but he won't. Not before he really hurts you. Not even then. That's because the salad wasn't on the table when he thought it ought to be. Look, I've written down this number for you. These people know how to help. Call them. Please. I did. They showed me how to save my life. ** Got it! Hey, that's mine! Not anymore! (Janice) Hey, you two! You know I asked you to put some of that stuff away. Your father will be home in a little while. In a minute, Mom. Now, please! (phone rings) Wife line. This is Barbara. How can we help? I don't wanna give my name. Well, that's perfectly all right. Just be easy. How can we help? Um, I have this friend... Well, her husband took a swing at her. I'm not sure if it will happen again, but if it does-- Will you tell her to come and talk to us here at the Y? We're at 840 South Apple Street. Or at least to call. We have counselors available anytime of the day or night. (door opens) I'm sorry. I have to go now. Hi. (sighs) So how'd your day go? Oh, come on, Janice. It's been three days. How long are you gonna keep this vow of silence? That was the worst time, Donny. That was the worst you ever hurt me. I know, and I said that I was sorry. It's just that... sometimes I guess I just don't know my own strength. Janice, I'll do anything that you want. Anything. I'll even go to Karen Renshaw's party. Go on. Call her up. Tell her that I've changed my mind, that we'll be there. And here. Here. I want you to buy yourself something really nice to wear. Come on, take it. You haven't bought a pretty dress in-- The other night, that, that woman. She just-- She just meant nothing to me, nothing. I told you. Nothing. It's just that I had a couple of drinks too many and I just-- it just happened, that's all. But I swear to you, if she walked through the room right now, I wouldn't even recognize her. Well, this you gotta believe, if you believe nothing else, because it's the truth. I need you. And... and I... I love you, and I... just-- You're the only woman that I ever cared about. Donny. I believe you. ** (chuckles) Hey, we got an audience. (roars loudly) I caught you. I caught you! (children laugh) I caught you. (laughing altogether) Hey, does anybody wanna know what's in my pocket? (children) Candy! Yeah, candy! Whoo! (children squealing and laughing) I don't care what anybody thinks, I don't enjoy being hit. I am not some kind of masochist. Then why do you stay with him? I don't know. Irene, would you like to know why I stayed and took it all those years? Because I was scared. I was more frightened of being on my own than of being hit. I mean, what was I trained for, having children and making avocado dip? Dolores, did you ever speak to him about that? We could never really talk to each other. We didn't know how to show affection or whatever feelings we had. No, fighting and hitting was our way of communicating. When he hit me, at least I knew I was alive, I existed, and as bad as that was, it was better than being ignored. I'd rather be ignored. But afterwards was nice. After he hit me, because he was gentle and he was sorry. (woman) You know why? 'Cause you were scared. He didn't want your friends to find out. Well, who has friends? They don't let you have any friends. They cut you off from everybody. It's always easier to blame the man, isn't it? Well, I didn't ask to be hit. Didn't you? No, I didn't. Dr. Morgan, I don't understand what she's talking about. I mean, I never did anything-- (Dr. Morgan) Anything to provoke him. Even though you knew he was out of control. Never said the wrong word at just the wrong moment. (whispers) Why? Why would I do that? If I allow him to beat me, then I don't have to accomplish anything to be a whole person. How can I be expected to be a whole human being? How can I be expected to know anything about money, to buy furniture, even to clean my house, when I live with a man who hits me? (Barbara) He's right. I guess somehow deep down inside, I felt I deserved to be hit. You know what I mean? No. (woman) Well, I'm not looking to take more than my own share of the blame. If anything went wrong, it was my fault. If the sun didn't shine in the morning, he pushed me down the stairs. Margo? Did you ever try to find out why? No, I didn't. Try. My husband saw his father beat his mother once, twice a month just to let her know who was boss. He just figured that was the way it was supposed to be. The last time my Terry started beating on me, I was seven months pregnant. I almost lost the child. Your old man ever smack you when you were pregnant? You don't understand. Donald isn't like that. Well, it's true that he did shove me, sort of, but he'd had too much to drink. He didn't know what he was doing. Huh-uh. Drunk don't count. That's just an excuse for a guy to do what he wants to do anyway. Does he beat his children? Absolutely not. He will. Sooner or later, most of them do. Well, you're wrong. You don't know Donald. You don't know anything about him. He works hard. He's a good husband, and he's good to the kids. When my father was dying, he stayed up all night with me, every night for two weeks. As far as what happened, he promised me it'll never happen again. I wouldn't count on it. You hang in there, Janice, just as long as you can. You give it every chance to work. How can you say that? You've been there. You know what she's going through. Yes, I've been there, and I'm going back. To your old man? Why in the world? Because I can't make it out there anymore! Because I've got three kids and I can't feed them on a welfare check. And nobody will rent us an apartment if it's got carpets on the floors or glass on the windows. You've given us a lot, and I appreciate the support, but, uh... (sobbing) I can't hold it together anymore, Dr. Morgan. And if getting punched once or twice a month is the price I have to pay to feed my kids, then... (sobbing) (music playing) Hold this, hold this. Donny? Donny? Hi. Oh, hey, how are you? You are beautiful. I'm so glad you didn't forget about-- Wait a minute. Benny! This is my beautiful Ben, and this is Don and this is Janice. Will you bartend for her, sweetheart? Because I'm gonna take this one to the kitchen and show her what a kitchen looks like. Come here. (Karen) Oh, hey, wait a minute, you people have to know each other. This is Jeffrey. I'm Janice. So Karen tells me you used to be quite a jock. Oh, I got kind of a late start. Played a little college basketball after I got out of the service. What'll you have? Vodka on the rocks would be fine. Ran a little track. Why are you so modest? Karen says you almost turned professional. Well, thought about it, but didn't quite work out. And now you're what? A stock broker? No, no, I sell insurance. Oh, say. Wait a minute, will you? Uh, Wes? (music continues) And he said, "Give me a shot of Big Rain." (laughs hysterically) Hey, don't worry. Nobody's gonna steal her away. On the other hand, I don't suppose you'd have any trouble at all finding a replacement. Nice of you to say so. Wasn't a casual observation, love. That was an invitation. Yeah, well, I think that I'll just, um, I'll take the compliment and pass on the offer. Whatever's easy. Let's take a walk, okay? Feel like I need a little room to breathe. Sure. Excuse us. You know, she decorated the whole apartment? Really? She even designed the new kitchen. Oh, yeah, did she design an extra bedroom for her house boy? Ben is not her house boy. He lives in the house, doesn't he? He's obviously only a boy. He's a graduate architect. He's already won prizes. Oh, is Karen supposed to be one of them? What law says a woman can't be interested in a man that's younger than she is? Well, I think it's the same law that says a woman should be home, taking care of her own kids instead of going to bed with somebody else's. Why are you so down on Karen? She likes you. I'm not down on her. I just don't want you to end up like her, that's all. Well, if you mean making something of myself, maybe getting a job or starting a little business, I gotta tell you, Donny, I wouldn't mind. You see what I mean? I could be of some help to you if you'd let me. I know I could. Maybe we could sell the house, get out from under some of those payments. We could live a simpler life, like when we first got married. That was the happiest time for us. Janice, I gotta tell you that I've lost my taste for honest property. I've worked hard for what I've got and I'm not gonna give it all up just to be some scruffy hippie living in a three-room apartment. I didn't say that. And I'm not gonna end up like my father either. Mean old buzzard that still thinks he's got a pot to spit in. He's a very sad old man. Oh. Yeah. You should've had him for a father. Donald, can I ask you a question? Of course. I know your father whipped you a lot when you were growing up. That's right, and I'm better for it. Did he... ever hit your mother? He did, didn't he? Okay, I'm sorry I brought it up. So am I. Well, come on, let's go back to the party then. Janice, why don't we just go on home? I thought that's why he farmed the kids out for the weekend, so we could relax for a change. Honey, the place is crawling with weirdos. They all look like they just flew over the cuckoo's nest. They're probably saying the same thing about us. Come on, honey. Let's forget about Rusty Fenton and endowments. (music playing) (party chatter) (indistinct chatter) Oh, Donald. Have you met Jeffrey? He's a landscape designer. Oh, terrific. Excuse us, would you please? Sweetheart. I'll be right back. I wanna get out of here. Well, you look like you were having a good time. Get your things. I'm not ready to go yet. I said, get your things! Let's go. You had to do it, didn't you? You had to humiliate me in front of Karen. Oh, I humiliated you, yeah. The way you were coming on to that guy. Coming on? You spent the whole afternoon hanging all over him. Donald, we were just talking. About what? About business. I told him I would like to open a little business. Why don't you just tell him you'd like to do open-heart surgery while you were at it? Why do you spend so much of your time trying to prove that I'm stupid? I suppose you're gonna tell me that's the first time you ever met the guy. I've been wondering what you've been doing with your afternoons. Looking at you, it's obvious that you haven't been at the gym. I think you actually expect me to stand here and defend myself. I'm not stupid. I know you've been spending time with him. And if we were? It's all right for you to mess around, is that it, but it's not all right for me? You're admitting it? Is that what you're doing? I'm admitting that you have a diseased mind! Well, why don't you just speak a little louder? Maybe the whole neighborhood would like to hear. I don't care who hears-- Shut up! (yelps in pain) (shrill screaming) Police officers. Open up in there. Kick it in. I'll go around back. You! Hold it right there! I-- I-- I live here. Don't-- don't shoot. Hands around. Okay. Spread 'em. All right, this is my house. I live here. Yeah, we'll talk about it. (sirens wailing) (police radio chatter) I caught him running out the back. Claims he's her husband. Yeah, he is. You're getting to be a regular customer, aren't you? All right, turn him loose. Maybe if you would've let me take the extra five minutes the other night, this wouldn't have happened. Maybe. (knock on door) What do you want? I don't need any help from you. Jan told me what she wants, and I won't take up two minutes of your time. Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing? She's gonna need some clothes when she comes out of the hospital that aren't covered with blood. I'll get her what she needs. I think that, uh, you are probably the last person she wants to see right now. Besides, she already has a visitor. Who? An assistant district attorney. And if Jan doesn't get you put away for six or eight months, then she's dumber than you've made her think she is. Oh, by the way, it might interest you to know that my friend Jeffrey, the landscape artist, has been working for the last half year in Boston, and he just made it in yesterday for my party. So you see, you fractured three of your wife's ribs for nothing, hotshot. You got what you need. You wanna get out of here? She needs a toothbrush. Now take this stuff, and please get out of here. That's it, isn't it, Don? That's the way you make your muscles ripple. By shoving around women half your size. I am not Janice, and you better keep that in mind, tough man. You wanna put your hand on me again? I'll not only call the cops, I'll call the whole damn Marine Corps. Oh, wow. You know, it's hard for me to believe that you really did that to her. You know, Donny, I could name you a dozen girls who would happily have pushed Jan in front of a truck for a chance to get next to you. And this may come as a surprise, I was one of them. Poor little Jan. She got lucky. (woman) If you'd been beaten in the street by a mugger, you'd be down to the D.A.'s office in a flash to file a complaint. Tell me why this is any different. Because he's your husband, right? Because if you lock him up, who's gonna pay the bills and who's gonna support your kids? Yes, that's part of it. Okay. Can we talk about your kids? You're not the only victim in this crime. Every time it happens, it puts a scar on them. An emotional scar. Five years ago, there were no decent rape laws in this state, and things didn't change until women were willing to testify. Now, how are we going to move those people in the state legislature if we can't even get the women who were beaten to stand up and say, "I'm not somebody's property. I have a god-given right not to be hit." I... I just don't know if I can do that to him. If you stay, and you give him a chance to put you in a coma for six months, or worse, would that be helping him? All right. Here's my number at the D.A.'s office. Don't ask for anyone else but me. Keep on ducking, sugar. ** Mr. Halston. Yes. I'm Dr. Morgan. Figured. If you have any questions, or you'd like to speak to me, please feel free to call. Sure. (birds chirping) The kids are fine. They're anxious for you to come home. I know. I've spoken with them on the phone. I swear to you that if I ever hurt you again, I'll-- Donny, don't. I'll pack up, I'll leave the country. Please. Don't go on making promises you can't possibly keep. There is a chance that you could change, only if you really want to, and only if you have help. Is that what... what he told you? Your Dr. Morgan there? Telling you that it's all my fault, is that it? What he said was if I let you hit me, then it's my fault, too. It's a two-sided game. We had a little argument. It got out of hand. We don't have arguments, Donald. Not like normal people anyway. We don't know how to fight. There's no middle ground for us. I either walk around in a trance because I'm so terrified of you, or if I open up my mouth, which I admit I do, then I run the risk that you'll kill me. Oh, come on, Janice. Aren't you overstating the case just a bit? No, I don't think so. There's this rage inside of you that you can't control. I don't know where it comes from, your father or where, but you've got to find out. Maybe it's me. Do you want to kill me, Donny? What is it you want me to do? I want you to see Dr. Morgan. Okay. Okay. I'll go. You sure you don't want to come spend a couple days with me? No, thanks, I've got some things to do. I have to meet Donald in town this afternoon. Janice-- Don't say it, Karen. I've had about all the good advice I can handle for one week. We're different, Karen, you and I. Let's just leave it at that, okay? You've changed so much. People change in 12 years. That's natural. You were so bright, and you were a smart aleck. The whole world was in front of you. And you didn't have bruises all over your face. No, just a mild case of acne. We were gonna climb Mount Everest, remember that? And learn how to fly airplanes and be Brenda Starr, the two of us. That's comic-book stuff. The real world isn't like that. Yeah, maybe. So what's real, going back in there to get smashed around again? That's not going to happen this time. Donald has made me certain promises. You're incredible. The man is an animal, don't you understand that? And you believe him and you trust him. How can you trust him? Because in spite of everything, I love him. But I guess you wouldn't understand that. No, you're right. I don't understand that. I don't understand staying with a guy who beats on you. I never heard anything about Jerry hitting you, so why didn't you stay and work it out with him? Oh, come on, Janice. This is not the 16th century, you know? "Divorce" is not a dirty word. And marriage isn't some high school Home Ec. course either, where you take your "F" and sign up for something else. You failed marriage, Karen. I don't intend to, not if I can help it. Donald and those kids, they're my life. And if I can't work it out with him, I mean, if I had to live the way you do, with some guy you know is gonna leave you, and then he'd spot something younger and prettier, and pretending you don't miss your children so bad sometimes you wanna die. I'm sorry. I guess I've said too much. Yeah. But nothing I haven't said to myself from time to time. I might not have all the answers, Karen, but neither do you. So I guess I'm just gonna work it out my own way. I hope you do, Jan. (car door closes) (grunts) Good night, Chris. And you, too. I'm sorry you had to be away for a few days, but Mommy's home now and things are gonna be fine. Good night. Come on, Peggy. It's your bedtime, too. Good night, baby. Good night. How's it going? Oh, good. Should be through here in a minute or two. I waited for you at Dr. Morgan's office this afternoon. Oh, yeah, I got tied up with a new client. Honey, I think things are gonna turn around for me again. Donald, you gave me your word. I know, I know, but it's-- I just can't help it. I don't believe in shrinks. Honey, you know I've been thinking about us. You know what the problem is? You know what has caused all of this? We were doing just fine until your friend Karen showed up, and she's really convinced you that you're unhappy. She really messed up your head. It's got nothing to do with Karen. Oh, come on, honey. You've never had these notions before about working, going to freaky parties, afternoon gripe sessions with women that don't even shave under their arms. Think about it. You've never cared about any of those things until Karen came along. Janice, honey, I want you to promise me, for both of us, that you won't see her again. Karen and I may not agree on everything, but she is my friend. I can't promise you anything of the kind. Please, Janice, please. I'm sorry, Donny. Well, you just leave me no choice, no choice. I am forbidding you to see that trouble-making, loud-mouthed broad again. Is that clear? Do I make myself understood? I wanna be a good wife to you. That's why I came home. But you've got to let me be a person, too. Well, be a person. Nobody is stopping you. Do you have to have her to be a person? (Chris) Don't! Don't hurt her! Chris, I am not hurting your mother. Go back to bed. I am not hurting him! ** Come here, honey. Come on, Chris. Come on. (door opens, then closes) Janice. Janice! Hurry up, Peggy. Get in there. Hurry up! Janice! Janice! What are you doing? Janice. Janice, what're you doing? Janice, roll down the window. I wanna talk to you. What did I do? (tires screeching) Janice! No, don't-- Janice! (Barbara) Okay now, here you go. You like pink? Mm-hmm. Good. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. I've just spoken to Dr. Morgan. He's on his way. They're setting up some cots in the recreation room for tonight. We don't even have any clothes. I bet I don't have $5 in my purse. We'll send somebody for your clothes in the morning and we'll lend you what you need until you can get straightened out. I'll have to get a job. Do you know anybody who might want to hire you? I don't know. Maybe. Well, don't think about that now. Tomorrow, we'll drop the kids off for school and then if you feel up to it, you and I can go out looking for an apartment. (bangs loudly) Peggy, don't. Let her get it out. (bangs continue) (motorcycle revs) (Donny) I painted Peggy's room bright yellow. I think she'll like it. Remember the garbage disposal that was so touchy that it got indigestion when you put egg shells in it? Well, I got a new one. So everything's ready for you to come back home. But I'm not ready. Janice, it's been two months. I want you back. We belong with each other. That's the way it is with us. Don't make me come begging. Can we discuss this some other time? I really don't want to lose this job. Well, I don't know why. You couldn't be earning enough here to feed a family of mice. You still don't understand, do you? Donald, I'll never be hit again. If I have to sleep in alleys and eat out of garbage cans, no one will ever hit me again. Janice, what do I have to do to get you back? Excuse me. It's me, Mrs. Wilkes. I'm home. Mrs. Wilkes? What are you doing here? Where's the baby-sitter? I sent her home. They're my kids, too, aren't they? Oh. Champagne and everything. I had a wonderful evening planned for us, Janice. You'll forgive me, I had to start without you. I would like you to leave, Donald. Now. That was him, wasn't it, that you were out with? That kid Jeffrey? We were not out. We had a late shipment of azaleas that we had to get ready for morning, and he just dropped me off. You don't have a car? The car is in the shop. I finally put together enough money to get that fender fixed. So you need me. I'm not gonna crawl off and die while you go hopping around town with somebody else. No. Are you drunk or crazy? The children are asleep in there. No, we won't wake them. We never did before. This is my place. I want you to leave. I'm not going to. You're my wife, and you belong to me. No! And I want you right now. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I want you, honey. Don't. Don't. I love you. You want me just as much as I want you. (gasps for air) I love you. I love you. (muffled cries) No, no, no! I'm sorry. It's just not rape. Not in this case. But he, he-- I know. It doesn't matter if you're separated or living apart. As long as you're married, the law in its wisdom, guarantees every man his connubial rights. This is my body. It doesn't belong to him. Under the law, a husband cannot rape his wife. I want him in jail. Did he hit you? Not this time. He choked me. Look. Now we're getting close. How hard? I almost passed out. It's a first offense. We'll ask for misdemeanor battery. That's six months in the county jail. Are you willing to go all the way with that? John, this is Charlotte Ames. I would like for you to draw up a complaint against a Mr. Donald Halston, for violation of penal code 242. Right. (hangs up) Which of you is Halston? Okay, Halston. Come along with me. You've been bailed out. Where is he? Cross the street at the bar. Says he'll wait till you're processed out. Mort. Hey. I know it was a lot of trouble for you to come down this way to bail me out. I wanted to thank you. Listen, John Dillinger, I got 315 bucks invested in you and-- You want a drink? Vodka on the rocks. Vodka on the rocks, huh? 315 bucks. And I don't know what a 242 is. I'll get the money to you in a couple of days. I'm not in a rush. What's a 242? Misdemeanor battery. Battery? Does that mean you actually hit her? Sort of. Mm-hmm. So she put you in jail for a sort of, huh? Well, you know how they are. She wanted to get even with me. And the... the time a while back, when she was in the hospital, with broken ribs? Did you do that? (sighs) Well, we had a little family argument. A little shoving. You know how it is. No, no, I don't know how it is. Donald, I thought I knew you. I don't know you at all. Oh, come on, Mort. Pow, right in the kisser. Hit them once a week whether they need it or not, remember? Oh, my God, Donald. I mean, maybe I joke about that. Maybe I even think about it once in a while, but... hit a woman? A guy just doesn't do that. Not if he has any self-respect at all. Who asked you for your opinion anyway? Nobody. Hey, Mort, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's like everything I've ever worked for is slipping away from me-- my job, my wife, everything. All I wanted was to try and get her back. That's all. That's all. (Donny) Well, I don't know. Maybe they're all right, Janice and Mort. Maybe I belong in jail. I'm beginning to think so. Now, how am I supposed to defend a client with an attitude like that, huh? Well, why don't you just not try so hard? Do us all a favor, right? I know Charlotte Ames. She's tough, but she's fair. I think we can get her to go along with straight probation. But we'll have to give her something. Have to give her what? Trust me. (indistinct chatter) Okay, here it is. Now, you plead guilty, six months probation, no jail, $500 fine, and one condition. What's the condition? You stay away from your wife. You can't see her, and you can't try to talk to her. (whispering) Okay, bye. Janice. Let her go, let her go. You mess up now, you bought yourself six months in the county jail. Wait a minute, please. Janice. You got nothing to say to me, Donald. Well, you're right. There's nothing that I can say to you to make up for what I've done to you. Well then, as long as we agree on that, I think we should leave the rest for our attorneys to settle up. You said there was a chance that I could change. I thought so. I don't think so anymore. Please, give me another chance. You're a human bomb, Donald. You're a threat to anyone who tries to get close to you. You're a threat to me, a threat to your kids. Well, I really think that I can deal with that now. I'm gonna see Dr. Morgan. I really am. I think that it's important. That's a beginning, but it's only a beginning. I don't want to live with rage anymore. I don't wanna live with fear. I don't want to live with pain. I might have needed that once. I don't anymore. Janice, you see, I've-- I've got to know that, of course when Dr. Morgan says that it's okay, I've just got to know that you're gonna be around. I-- I really am frightened. I never heard you say that before. Oh. I've always, always been afraid that somehow I wouldn't measure up, always afraid that I wouldn't live up to what my father expected of me or what I expected of myself. I-- I was always afraid that I'd lose you. Always. When I first met you, Donny, I was 17 years old. My heart stopped. I couldn't breathe for three days. Do you think I cared if you ever became a millionaire, or had "vice president" after your name? Janice, you know what I've got to do? It's going to take a little time. I know.
