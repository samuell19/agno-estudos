Two for 5. Check it out, check it out. Two for 5. Check it out, check this out. Check it out. Two for 5. Gentlemen, the FBI has asked for our support. The recent bombings will see increased surveillance in higher-risk areas, low-income neighborhoods, ethnic districts. We'll divide that up. Obviously, our focus will be here on the mosque that's on the South side. You better be careful with calls from Pakistan, huh? Shut up, Nieman. Sorry. Now, let's stretch. 1, 2. 3, 4. 5, 6. 7, 8. Are you okay, ma'am? You think I can move like you? I've seen you shake your booty before, Carol. You hush that. Flow is natural, it's not exercise. How are your knees today? Hey, what do you think? Give me six weeks and you'll walk. Impossible. You just have to believe. I do believe in Christ. Now, what is this horrible music going on? It's Bollywood! Oh, no. Uh, new girl bugging you, Carol? Hey, Shona Auntie. 1, 2. You're killin' me, cava. Take the damn call. Just my brother, man. He only calls when he needs something. Tell him that! Are you kiddin' me? Brown people never say what they mean. Super healthy. I signed my name on the special assignment roster. You? FBI? Really? Tired of the small jobs, man. Small paychecks is what you're tired of. Dua chose out of state. Juilliard. Damn. So now, it's on me. Give yourself some credit, man. You're raisin' her, alone. So about the audition, what shall we mix with ballet? Yes, I've been thinking. How about salsa or tango? Salsa isn't eastern. How about bharatanatyam? Odissi, Kathak? Kathak? We've been through this before, Dua. Your father and I had a deal. He's just tryin' to protect you, Dua. From what? Pakistan's always on the list. The invisible one. What has gotten into you today? I've got a shot at Juilliard! No way! What? We're brown and we like to dirty dance! - Get out of here. - Yeah, she likes dirty dancing and white boys. Uh, no one said anything about liking him. Faisal? The imam's son partying? Oh, what a rebel! Well, I'm here, I'm not a rebel like you. - Hey. - What is this? Stop. It's beautiful. I just got it from Karachi. What does it say? Mashallah! A protection from the evil eye. Karachi. What's it like there? The sounds, the smell. Pure and instant magic. Magic? Why'd you ask me a call before I came in? - What? - Your grandfather is here. From Pakistan? Oh my God! You're drunk? Unbelievable! It's okay, dude. Just listen to me, okay? He'll be staying in your studio. I want you to clear anything that screams dance. - You haven't... - Just listen to me. Okay, okay, let me meet him first. You have a mint? Put that on. Oh my God. Dua. As-salamu alaykum! Salaam. These are scarf. I brought them to sell for my NGO. We help women. They come from different villages to sell their handicraft. You just beta try one. You just try... Mashallah! Why don't you go upstairs? Um, I've... I've got a bit of a headache. I'll see you in the morning. Good night. He showed up out of the blue? Out of nowhere, man. And how long is he here for? A month. Damn. It's a brown thing. Glad I'm not brown. It's crazy how tiny and old he is. I remember him so strong, so huge. We outgrow fast. How long since you saw him last? 12 years. I didn't wanna see his face after my wife died. Oh, Dua, my child! Come, come, come. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! I think you're feeling better. Yeah. Good. How come you have no curtains in this room? Oh, it was my studio. - Study. - Oh. I... I like lots of light. Oh. I'm sorry I took your studio. Oh, no. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, just my lower back. That's because of the long flight here. You should stretch. Oh. I can't do it now. I'm too old for all that. Oh, you're not too old. Hmm. I teach people way older than you. You teach people? Body movement. You should come, we have fun. Exercising, dancing. I don't dance. Oh, you have got magic. Yeah. What's that? 99 attributes of Allah. It's beautiful. It's tasbeeh. You can keep it. Oh, no, I'm just admiring it. Look Dua, this is Al Noor. The light. Officer Khawar, this is Agent Weller of the FBI. Officer Khawar is one of our best. What can I do for you? We've received information of possible suspicious activity at the Jinnah Mosque. In Devon? - From where? - Reliable sources. May I ask um, what kind of suspicious activity exactly? Well, that hasn't been confirmed, but... Money laundering for possible terrorist-related organizations. We'd like you to start attending the mosque regularly, use your ties to the community, report back with any specific clues you see that might help us with the investigation. I don't go to mosque. Well, we'd like you to find a reason to go. Start off by getting a list of charities they support. I live in that community. The less reason for suspicion. We appreciate your cooperation, Khawar. You made this? Contrary to popular belief, I can cook. But actually Baba made this. You can cook now. See? Things change. It's very good. Why? Does it taste bad? Still answering questions with questions. It's just a tad bit too spicy for me. That's because you have not been taking Pakistani food. Well, we're in America. I really like it, though. Hmm? Um, Majeed... I was wondering if you could take me to the mosque tomorrow morning for Fajr? Don't you have your morning meeting? Prayers are meant to fit your work schedule and Fajr is right at sunrise, so I don't think Majeed's meeting is at sunrise. Sure, we can do that. I'll come, too. This morning's traffic update brought to you by AM 1030. It's Paul Thompson and it's 5:30 a.m. On the south side of Chicago, the traffic is rolling out. Baby, you gotta go through a separate door. - Salam, brother. - Salam. Ali. Majeed. It's been a while. Uh, Majeed. - As-salamu alaykum! - Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! Welcome, welcome. I see you've met brother Ali already. - Yes, I have. - Yeah, that's right. This is brother Sahil. Hmm. Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! Majeed. Your father just told me uh, he had some uh, heart trouble in the last year. Here's my card. I would love to help you in any way I can. This is what community is here for. But I hope you and your father will continue to come to our humble mosque. InshAllah! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Just for the audition. It's only three weeks. Please. Please, please, please. You're just like your father. - Good-looking? - Stubborn. If he finds out, you know you won't ever see me again, right? Ghungroos are a dancer's guide. They don't just release the music, they release a dancer's soul as she dances. Respect them. When these are on your feet, nothing else touches your feet, just Mother Earth. - What is that sound? - Oh. Those... Are the ghungroos. I'm learning Kathak. Why? Juilliard wants us to incorporate something from our culture. This is not part of your culture. My mother was a Kathak dancer. It's just that in Pakistan, a lot of the Kathak dancers were not considered good. Prostitutes! Two for 5. Check it, check it out. So you're spyin' on your dad? I wouldn't put it like that. But you know what? It's all gonna check out in the end. - I know that. - Aray! I didn't know you are a police officer. I didn't know you own Khan Sweets. Uh, I'm just a temporary manager here. Ali just moved to the US. My partner Matt. - Nice to meet you. - Same. How you likin' it? It's different on your own soil. Hmm. I met him at the mosque. I don't envy your situation. Hands, please. Tastes better. - Anything else? - Thank you. Just check Thank you. Salam, Baba. What does it say? Can't you read it? I can't read Arabic. Have you not read Qur'an? Not even the translation? Prayer. Dua, Arabic and Urdu. My name means "prayer"? Yeah, Dua. Huh. It kinda looks like a ballerina when you look at it this way. I'm just kidding. Dua. Baba, I don't remember sitting in a separated area of the mosque when I was a little girl. When we go to pray, we must not be thinking of anything but Allah. That's on the men then. Why do they look at us? You're guarding your soul by guarding your body. But how does segregation in the mosque really do anything when we live in a co-ed world outside? Then we must segregate the whole world. How come you never told me my name means "prayer"? Of course, I did. I don't remember. And why haven't I read the Quran yet? Baba's really laying it heavy. You have your whole life to read it. But shouldn't we read guidance before we start our lives? How's the audition comin' along? It'll be great. I just know it. Well, you're in good hands. Hi. Here. How's Baba? He's good. Look uh, thank you for taking care of the audition and the... for the job. Are we gonna be so formal now? Do you wanna come have some tea? I wish I could. I have to go. Shona Auntie. Yes. Was Kathak a dance of the whores? Absolute nonsense. These dances are divine. Not in Pakistan. Some have used the enticing nature of the dance for different ends, but that doesn't change the intention of the dance. That's beautiful. Baba gave it to me. I wish I could share all of this with him. The time will come. The yearning in the dance was the yearnin' of the spirit to be reconnected with God. It's graceful. Good. Good job. Keep that up. Keep that up. Okay. - Ready, Carol? - Okay, oh. Okay. - Oh, no. - Come on, you can do it. - Come on. - Oh, I don't think I'm ready. Come on, come on, there you go. - Uh, good job. - Oh. Okay, you can do it, Carol. Good job. - Wait a min... - Oh my God. Wait a minute. Oh, look at that. - Hey! - Oh my God, look at that. - Oh. - Everybody! Everybody, come and take a look. Dance is a healer of trauma, - both mental... - Dancing. And physical. I've never seen him here before. Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Majeed, Majeed! I texted you I'll be home myself tonight. Just like her mother! What about ma? She didn't understand our ways! - Why? - What? Where did you get those? My ghungroos? I use them in my choreography. I told you anything but Kathak. You never told me why. 'Cause Kathak killed your mother! Yes, in fact, I wanted to make a note and maybe have another dance class... Glad to see there's some uh, handsome man checking in. - Hey. - Hi. This is Dua's father. Oh, that Dua. - Nice meeting you, ma'am. - You, too. I wasn't expecting you. Did you start teaching her Kathak? I'm sorry. I should have told you, but you should come see her. - I mean she's incredible. - I'm not... I'm sure she is, but we had a deal. We can't move forward until we face our past. I'm not ready. As-salamu alaykum! Come here. No, no, no. Come closer to me, sit here. That's Al Aalim! All-knowing. Does he know how my mother died? Of course, He does. Does He know why you don't like her? I never said so. Why don't you like dancing? It's against my principles. I'm not here to tell you what to do. The body has its own desires. Can lead you to the wrong path. It's not just the body. You're no more a child, you're a woman. And when you flaunt your body in front of men, they see your body, not your soul. I feel connected to God when I dance. That may be so, but Qur'an forbids women dancing in front of men. Go and read for yourself. Read. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! - Thank you. - Good Khutba! Uh, see you next week, imam, inshallah. Thank you. As-salamu alaykum! Can I ask you something? Yes, please. You promote a lot of um, international charities, right? Yes, brother. Are you having any problem uh, moving money abroad? Why? Oh, my brother in Pakistan has been complaining about transferrin' money up. He said it's getting harder. We have to manage. When the money is needed, it's needed. Well uh, if I can be of any help, let me know. What would you be able to do? Well, I uh, could find out how it's being obstructed to begin with. See you next week, imam, inshallah, thank you. That would be of great help to the community. Thank you, brother. Thank you for ensuring... "So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in the husband's absence what Allah would have them guard. But those wives from whom you fear arrogance, first advise them. Then if they persist, forsake them in bed and finally strike them." As-salamu alaykum, brother. Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! We have become your second home now. Daughter? So Shonali told me it'll help you get into Juilliard. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Why did Kathak kill ma? Judgments were crippling. Who judged her? Baba? He's not the man I knew once, okay? I started reading the Qur'an today. What did you read? The verse about striking women. Chapter 4, verse 34. You know, the word "strike" is misinterpreted as hitting. It actually means "to go and strike". Oh my God! Two for 5. Check it out. This is her home. These are her people. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! Great to see you, Majeed bhai. And how are you, young man? Behtreen, first class! Theek thak? Haan! Okay, so there's some uh, good news and... Th... the bad news first, please. Okay, it seems like we'll uh, need an angioplasty. One of his arteries is severely blocked. It's a standard procedure. He'll be okay. And when would he need that? As soon as possible. Oh, and his blood pressure. Uh, how's he's doing on that? Oh, yes, um... These are the readings from last week. Doing much better. - Excuse me, I have to... - Hmm. Take this. You've done a lot of right in your life, Mr. Khawar. No, doctor, you're also doing a lot of charities for Bangladesh. Jaffar was telling me. Jaffar is number 1 gossip, hmm? And you're doing a lot in Pakistan. Uh, I'm in search of a place where I can stock my scarf. We have a store in Devon and we would love to stock them there. I'm so glad, thank you. Just take care of yourself, okay? I'm just beginning to gain his trust. There is a lot at stake if this money gets in the wrong hands. I'm moving as fast as I can. Once we get the list of charities, we can make the connections fairly... If there are any connections. So all these charities are blocked now? They used to let all those transfers through before the attacks. Now it's just slowed to a crawl. Hmm. Sometimes they don't even accept those transfer at all. Oh, that's frustrating. I've been talking to the other mosques as well. It seems like a blanket shut down. They act as if we are sending funds to terrorists or something. Maybe it's time to show them otherwise. If they asked me I could show them paper trail to everything, vet every charity. Uh, do you have sugar? I'm so sorry. Let me get some. "Tell the believing women to reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts. They should not stamp their feet, so as to draw any attention to any hidden charms." Let's see how much money we'll make, inshallah. Baba, I've been reading the Qur'an and it... it doesn't say anywhere directly that people shouldn't dance. Well, I'm pleased you've taken time to read Qur'an. There is a verse about... about stomping your feet, but I don't know if... I don't know. The verse is generally quoted as being against dance and music. It is Luqman, 6, we say, "Those who pursue amusement that lead people away from God will be humiliated." You believe in the word of God or you don't? Oh, come on. Come on, ask yourself. Begin your jihad. Jihad? Me? It's your inner war to cast out sin to do good deeds, to love God with your heart and soul. Chapter 24, verse 30. "And to wrap a portion of their head covers over their chests." Uh, aren't you gonna be hot in that? This is a kurti? People wear clothes like this in Pakistan every day. Actually, heavier than this. In the fields, in the heat. Yeah, but you're not in Pakistan nor in the fields. But I am Pakistani. I thought you were Indian. Don't listen to her. You look fine, Miss Dua. Thanks, Ya'ir. Now, I have a surprise for you. I thought we could start with nature's music today. And a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You can't dance Kathak without ghungroos, Dua. I forgot. I'm so sorry. So today, we're going to be workin' on abhinaya. Expressions. We use our eyes in mysterious ways, awaken the desire, flirt with the soul. How is flirting okay for a pure dance form? It's so easy being Hindu. You have gestures that communicate directly with God. You even have a dancing God. There's nothing that connects Kathak to Allah. I've been searching the Qur'an. God is one you believe that, don't you? Can we not flirt when we dance? Can we be modest? Modesty is in the intention. Is it your intention to be modest? Let's not dance today. Hmm. I didn't know he had a charity. Nice guy. Treating my father. Look at all these countries. I can see why they're worried. Really? Just 'cause somebody's sending a lot of cash to Yemen doesn't mean the Yemeni terrorists are involved. Did you just hear yourself? Wow, Neiman. Shonali. Hey. Everything okay? Sure. I don't have the balls to kiss her yet. Ha-ha. When you send this over to him? I need to study it a bit more. I'll see you later. Adios. She's been a bit confused lately. About? It's like she's lookin' for permission to dance. From? The Qur'an. Baba. She's going to go towards everything you try to keep her away from. Baba, Kathak, Islam. I never kept her away from Islam. You never cook for me. He's a lonely old man. So am I. Tomatoes, please. Anyways, I wanted to congratulate him. We finally stocked his scarves. Really? Where? Some Dr. Sahil Khan. I don't know. Didn't you go home for the day? Where is that charity list? Where you left it. Calm down. I'm sure it's here. Baba put up his scarves at Sahil Khan's store. That doctor? I gotta warn Baba. It's an FBI investigation. You'll get yourself in trouble. He's my father. I'm sure he'll be fine. Agent Weller gave me the charity list you submitted. Very thorough work, officer. Despite blocks on these charities, money was still gettin' through. - How? - Underground banks running from China into Pakistan, highly sophisticated, run by crime syndicates. They only went to these banks, because the government held up their legal options. Either way, these are great leads. I still don't have anything concrete. The FBI will connect the dots from here on. We'll be in touch for anything else. Thank you for your service. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! May I ask you why you left the mosque? My wife died. I didn't care to ask for anything else. How do you know in every instant if you're taking the right or the wrong step? We don't. The outcome of our every step is not in our control, but what is in our control is our intention. So in this step you speak of is your intention good? You're a good man, Majeed. Allah will reward you. You won't be able to sit for a few days, Baba. Why would I eat?! And Majeed, can you take me to the mosque? Salam, Baba. Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! Hey, Dua, we are going to the mosque. You want to join us? I have to go to Shona Auntie's. Hmm. But... but I'll... I'll see you at the hospital, okay? Good luck. My hard-working child. Okay. Yes, fine. Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Hands up! It's the FBI! Get down! Get down! Hey, Majeed! Everyone, get down! Majeed. Majeed! Get down. Get down! Now. Place of worship. Get down! Get down! Let's go here. Let's go, let's go! - Majeed. - I'm... I'm Chicago PD, this is my dad. He has a heart condition. Majeed! Uh, be... be gentle with him! Sorry, sir, orders from the top. Majeed! Come on, let's go, go, everyone, let's go! Officer Khawar, you weren't supposed to be here! Let's go, pick it up! Go, pick it up! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Move it, move it, move it! You can't do this, this... this is a place of worship. Hey, Majeed! Pops, what's wrong? Pops, where's baba? Baba? Hey, Maj... Majeed, don't d... I gotta do this. How does arresting everyone at the mosque justify this investigation? Preliminary investigation. He's a heart patient. They're going through SOP. Which we both know can take months. The FBI wants full control over the case. Of course. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! You have done a good job. I'm done here! Dua Khawar. Dua Khawar. Last call, Dua Khawar. Dua! You can't take that. Nope. It's like a... a rosary. But this is Arabic. Salam, Baba. Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! They only let me give you these. This is all I need. You must think so low of me now. That day I... I chose to go to dance practice instead of coming with you to the mosque. So you think it's all your fault? I know you're innocent. We all make our own fortune. Don't blame yourself. All actions are judged by intentions. Reading Prophet's sayings, too, now? Mhmm. We'll get you out of here. As-salamu alaykum! Wa 'alaykumu s-salam! Thank you for seeing me. If He can be ever forgiving, who am I? I didn't know about the raid. But you knew they were investigating us. - Not initially. - You threw your community under the bus. Under the Patriot Act, the FBI can basically do anything. Now, I believe they don't have anything and I know you can help me. You once told me that if need be you can stand behind every charity that you support. I can. I need your help to get you all out of here. How can I trust you? You don't have an option. I've seen this pattern before whenever she's away from dance. Like Fatima. You know maybe Dua can learn from her mother's mistakes if she knew what they were. You're gonna get through this. May I join you? Shonali told me. I can't dance if I don't feel like it. If you don't dance, you don't feel anything. I know you. I just need Baba to be okay. We're trying. You know, for the first time in years I felt like we had a family. I meant a complete family. These were Fatima's. I'm so sorry I didn't give them to you earlier. Your mother... She jumped in front of a moving car. It wasn't an accident. All these years, I... I didn't wanna share this burden with you. I thought if I could... Keep the truth from you, I could protect you. She loved dance so much. When she stopped dancing, she just... ...stopped. I wish I could have saved her. Hi, is this the Shukar Foundation? Uh, this is Chicago PD. I'm trying to see if there was a donation made anytime seven months from Chicago. Yeah, thanks for your help. Al-Shukar checks out. ...FBI. - We do things by the book. - What do you mean by the book? You're not in the FBI. Agent Weller, explain to me how this is gonna defend anyone? Your work checked out. Did Weller sign off on it? He's been reassigned to another case... So what happens now? They need to watch the mosque for a few more weeks. What for? For the two charities that haven't checked out yet. The ones I couldn't check out? If I hadn't taken the time out to prove this, they'd all rot in jail. But they're free to go, immediate effect. And the time lost? I did my best. Khawar, in light of your work I think we can justify that promotion. Right now all I can think about is what my father's gone through because of the system I work for. Okay. I'll be right back. You brought this saying back to me. by intentions. As long as you are pure in your heart for why you want to do something go do it. But... ...be sure to accept the consequences. I made you something. Oh. I'll put it where it's the first thing I see every morning. Can't you stay? You keep telling me I'm just like ma. You know what I get from you? You're a fighter. First Sergeant Majeed Khawar will now take his oath. I, Majeed Khawar, do solemnly swear on my honor that I will never betray, my badge, my integrity, my character or the public trust. And I will always have the courage to hold myself and others accountable for our actions. And I will always uphold the constitution, my community, and the agency that I serve. So help me God.
