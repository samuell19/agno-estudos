Well, Dave, this looks like a good place to start. Sure is fine country, Whip. When the railroad's built, I think I might even take a ride on it. Ah, the company will appreciate that. But right now, we're being paid to survey this valley, not admire it. Now, get off that horse and let's start working. Take a side on that pass we came through this morning, Dave. We'll work due west from there straight through the valley. Right you are. I don't wanna disturb you or anything but your scope is pointed the wrong way. Unh-unh, that's what you think. Come here. Take a look. She doesn't look very happy. Oh, I'll fix that. Good morning, miss. At least I hope it's miss. Good morning. Ah, permit me to introduce myself. I'm Dave Connors. This is my partner Whip Wilson. We're both representatives of Central Valley Railroad, Miss.. Martin, Frances Martin. You men are surveyors, aren't you? 'Yes, indeedy, Miss Martin, the best.' You mean, there's really gonna be a railroad line through the valley? That's the intention, alright. 'That's wonderful. How soon will that be?' Construction will start in a couple a months, I'd say. Just as soon as we get the route laid out and okayed by the government. That's the best thing that could happen to the settlers in this valley. Glad to be of service to you. And it's nice to see that smile on your face, Miss Martin and instead of the frown you were wearing a few minutes ago. 'Is there..' 'Is there anything we can do to help you?' Thank you, no. Things will be alright soon. Soon as the railroad is built. 'Who lives in that cabin?' A homesteader named Hawkins and his wife. Relatives of yours? No, just neighbors. Goodbye. Good luck. Hey, don't rush off. Ah, I don't even know where she lives. Well, she shouldn't be too hard to find. You know, Whip that's just a type of girl that I really like. You don't say. You know, Dave this one time I'd like to see the girl that isn't the type you like. - Hey. - Now, get busy. Martinsville? Never heard of it. That girl we met this afternoon was named Martin, wasn't she? That's right. Look, Whip. Look at the names on those buildings. Martin's livery stable. Martin's dry goods. And Martin's saloon. Somebody name Martin is awful busy around here. You said it. Hey, Martin transit company. I said that girl was just my type. Boy, I pick 'em, don't I? Alright, relax. Let's put our horses up at Martin's livery stable and.. ...get a room at Martin's hotel. You know, if that girl really owns this whole town and I marry her, I could change the name to Connorsville, couldn't I? Connorsville. How does that sound? - Terrible. - Oh, you are just jealous. Why, you feel better since you got cleaned up? Yeah. I could go for some food. Me too. Let's try the saloon, huh? I'm getting tired of your cooking. Oh, it's a good thing one of us can cook or we'd have both starved long ago. Hey, wait. What's going on there? What do you mean take it somewhere else? Where else is there to take it? Well, that's your problem. I'll ship it for you at the regular rates. Regular rates, my foot. Mooney, you know dang well you charge twice what you should. How do you expect a man to earn the living? That looks like the homesteader that was arguing with the Martin girl this morning. Yeah. Appears he doesn't get along with anybody. You get paid for your produce, don't you? Sure, I get paid alright. Just enough to cover the cost that you ship them, that's all. What am I suppose to use to buy flour and sugar and tobacco? Oh, why don't you quit eating? Smoking too. Oh, you no good, dirty.. Using that shotgun won't help, mister. Let me go. Do as he says, stranger. Let the old goat go. I can handle him. - 'I'll...I'll bet you on that.' - I can handle you too. Take it easy, Dave. He was only kidding you, mister. Sure, I was only kidding. I wouldn't hurt you much. I don't know who you fellows are but let me give you a little advice. Don't start any trouble in this town because you'll get it fast. Thanks a lot. Now, I'll give you a little advice. You fellows got no call to get mixed up in fights on my account. Thanks for stopping me. Alright, Mooney. I'll ship the stuff. Give me a receipt. I'll get it for ya. Much obliged. He'd have plugged me before I could've got my gun cocked. We're glad to do it. My name is Hawkins. My name is Whip Wilson. This is my partner Dave Connor. Glad to know ya. You taking on homesteading around here? If you are let me-- No, we are surveyors, Mr. Hawkins. Oh. - Surveyors? - That's right. Well, what are you doing in Martinsville? We're laying out a route for the Central Valley Railroad. You mean, they're gonna build a railroad through this valley? - Honest? - They sure are. You fellows wouldn't fool me, would ya? No, the company's had its eye on this route for sometime. We think it's pretty good too. 'How long will it be before they get their tracks laid?' 'Oh, we gotta survey the valley first, old timer.' - 'What's your hurry?' - 'What's my hurry?' 'Do you realize that the railroad' 'is the greatest thing that's ever happened here?' 'It means that me and a lot of farmers and homesteaders' 'like me can begin to live like human beings again.' What do you mean? Well, we can ship our produce and our beef to a decent rates. And we can buy things from other towns instead of from Martin stores. Does the store overcharge you? Mister, overcharge is a wrong word. Rob would be a better one. This thief Mooney gets so much for shipping my stuff I ain't got enough money left to keep alive. Unless I go into debt with Logan at the grocery store. Well, he gives you credit, doesn't he? 'Credit? Sure.' 'For a season or two. Until, you get in too deep' 'you can never pay off.' And then they take your farm away from ya. - I tell ya-- - Here's your receipt, Hawkins. Stuff will be shipped out tonight. He's the first one the railroad will make an honest man out of, and that'll kill him. He works for Martin, doesn't he? Mister, in this town, everybody works for Martin. Or starves. Don't start anything, Dave. Who, me? I never start anything, Whip, you know that. Oh, sure. Meat, bread, looks good. - How about a meat sandwich? - Good idea. Lunch counter's closed. When did the lunch counter close, mister? - Just now. - Excuse me. I said, the lunch counter was closed. Sorry, I don't hear so well. Maybe this will help you hear better. Don't let me interrupt your lunch, boys. - Pickle, Whip? - Yeah. - Here you are. - Thanks. Anytime, anytime. You're pretty handy with that gun, aren't you? Oh, just average. Little bit better than that, I'd say. You might as well know right now, mister. We don't like gunslingers in Martinsville. They are not welcome here. That's good. Glad to hear it. Nothing we like better than a nice law-abiding town. Maybe we'll stay for a while. Maybe you won't. Oh, I think we will. We kind of like it here. Don't we, Dave? Now, listen, you two.. No, you listen, friend. You stay out of our way and we'll stay out of yours. Understand? - Where are you going? - I'm gonna get another gun. Those two are gonna wreck the place. No, they aren't. I'll handle them. What about Crawford and Macklin? They're getting cut up pretty bad, Miss Martin. So.. Ah. Oh, you fellas really started things off right, I tell ya-- Good afternoon, Mr. Hawkins. Won't you introduce me to your friends? No, only to my enemies.. ...but you know all of them already. I-I'm Dave Connors, ma'am. This is Whip Wilson. Delighted, gentlemen. My name is Clara Martin. Any relation to Frances Martin? Why, yes. We're sisters. Do you know Frances? Do I know Frances? No, he doesn't. We only met her for a moment this morning while we were out working. I understand you're surveyors. That's right. Well, if you have a moment, I'd like to speak with you. We've got lots of moment, Miss Martin. Good. This way please. Take it easy, Dave. This is not going to be as pleasant as you think it is. Oh, no. The trouble with you is, Whip you don't know how to enjoy life. Come on. After I decide which sister I like the best.. ...you can have the other one. That'll make us brothers-in-law. Won't that be nice? Gentlemen, this is Mr. Benson. Mr. Connors and Mr. Wilson. How do you do? Mr. Benson is president of the Martinsville bank. Oh, really? How's business, Mr. Benson? - Very good lately. - Oh, glad to hear it. I hope you'll accept my apology for the unpleasantness. Some of the local men are little hotheaded. No harm done, Miss Martin. What did you wanna talk to us about? Then I'll get right to the point, Mr. Wilson. As you may have noticed, my father owns practically every commercial enterprise in the community. And most of the valley land is in his name also. That's not entirely true. Most of the valley is government grazing land except for a few homestead permits issued a few years ago. Then it must be clear to you, that my father's the only big cattle rancher in the territory. Without his consent, none of the homesteaders now living in the valley would've been able to exist at all. Oh, I realize that. It's kind of him to allow it. But I've seen a lot of sodbusters run off their land just because some big cattleman didn't want them there. As long as they cooperate for the benefit of the community my father's happy to have them. By the way, where is your father, Miss Martin? Well, he isn't very young anymore, Mr. Connors. He's worked hard enough all his life to enjoy his old age. I take care of his business in town. He stays on the ranch. I see. Then we are actually talking to the real.. ...boss of Martinsville. Well, I've handled my father's affairs for years. He trusts me. Mr. Wilson. Is it true that your railroad company plans to run their tracks through Martinsville? Oh, it looks that way, Miss Martin. Well, whose decision is it as to what routes you'll take? Yours? Well, I guess it's pretty much up to Dave and I. We've worked for the company a long time. And they-they trust our judgment. I see. Of course, you'll take the shortest and most profitable route. That's right. I.. I imagine you gentlemen are familiar with most of the country around here. What would your reaction be to recommending that the railroad go through Cactus City instead of Martinsville? Cactus City? You mean that little mining town about a 100 miles south of here? That's right. Well, that would take almost another 80 miles of track through rocks and hills. This valley is a natural, and almost perfect road bed. Plus, producing farms and lots of them. That little town Cactus City, why, it's almost a ghost town. There's not a producing mine there. Do you feel if that extra 80 miles of track would be too expensive? Oh, sure, it would. Not only that-- My bank would be willing to bear that expense. It wouldn't cost your company an extra cent. What's wrong with the people in this town? Looks to me like they don't want a railroad going though here. Yeah. It looks that way, doesn't it? Well, now that we've gotten that point across. I'd like to ask you a question, Mr. Wilson. How much does the railroad company pay you boys? You know.. How does the idea of a bonus strike you? That depends, Miss Martin on who pays it and what it's for. I think we can dispense with beating around the bush. Mr. Benson and I can make it very much worth your while to change your recommendation to the Central Railroad Company. Say, ah, $5,000? Sorry, not interested. 'How about you?' Whip's the boss. And even if he wasn't.. ...bribes are a little out of my line. 'Perhaps, our offer was a little low.' I'm not even curious to see how high you'd go. What's getting me is.. ...what's your objections to railroads? I can answer that, Dave. With the railroad running through Martinsville the farmers and cattlemen would be able to ship their beef at reasonable rates. Even buy things from other cities instead of from Martin's stores. They'd be independent Americans, instead of Martin's servants. Might even change the name of the town. - Are you through, Mr. Wilson? - 'Yes, I am.' You don't know how through you are. That little argument which you distinguished yourself so handily was only a sample of what you'll run into. You've had your fun. Now, get out. Yes, ma'am. We really hate to leave this nice place though. Been so pleasant. I mean, get out. Get out of Martinsville. Get out of the valley. It's, ah, been a pleasure, ma'am. I didn't think it would work. Send Crawford and Macklin in here. What are you gonna do, Clara? What do you think I'm gonna do? Just sit here and let a couple of stupid surveyors ruin me? Clara, listen. They can't hurt you. Suppose, there is a railroad built through Martinsville. We've got enough money now to take care of us. Whose got enough? Oh, alright. It's your money. But I helped you get it. What about our plans? Have you forgotten them? I've waited five years now for you to marry me, Clara. How much longer is it going to be? Not too much longer, Arnold. Another year or two, and I'll have every dime possible to squeeze out of this valley. I still don't think we should take a chance on those two surveyors. The Central Valley Railroad is a big organization. It's got the government behind it. If we do anything to their employees-- We are not gonna do anything but scare them. They don't look like the type who scare easily. Leave it to me, Arnold. Now, please send in Crawford and Macklin. Alright, dear. Ah, you big dope, it's stuffy in here. Why don't you open the wind? Hold it. It's time fellas like you were home in bed. Where did you come from? I'll ask the questions, if you don't mind. Hey, what's going on around here? 'Come on down, Dave.' Be right there. How do you spell souvenir? S-O-U-V-E-N-I-R. Hurry up, will ya? You don't have to write her a book, you know. By the way, what did that note say we got? Well, something about laying off the survey if we wanted to stay alive, foolishness like that. That Martin girl is pretty smart. She might mean what she says. We better keep our eyes open. Yeah, tomorrow. Right now, I gotta get some sleep. You wanna try that too, instead of running around the streets all night. Hawkins? Mr. Hawkins? Put this inside. This is what they're after. Hold it, Dave. Looks like they're quitting. Why, those no good lowdown. There's one of the Martin girls. Let's ask her a few questions. Is everything alright? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but everything is just fine. Simmer down, Dave. You have some explaining to do, Miss Martin. This survey we're making is a government approved project, you know. And interfering with us is pretty serious business. I know and I don't blame you for thinking I had something to do with this, this attack, but I didn't. I was trying to get out here to warn you. But I see it wasn't necessary. I'm glad you weren't hurt. How can a little girl with such a nice smile tell such big fibs. I'm telling the truth. I saw my sister talking to those men at the ranch last night. And then this morning, they rode out early. I tried to get here before they did. Sure, kid. Sure. - Now, listen, you-- - Alright, you two. I think she's telling the truth, Dave. I'm sure Mr. Hawkins won't mind if we go inside and talk this thing over, Miss Martin. No Martin has ever set foot in this house while I've been in it, and none ever will. Hold it now, Mr. Hawkins. When I talked to this particular Martin yesterday she seemed happy the railroad was gonna be here. Why don't you give her a chance? Albert Hawkins? Don't you drive that girl away from here again. I'll take a skillet to you. By golly! The old lady ain't had strength enough to talk to me like that for months. She must be feeling better. She'd been better a long time ago if you let me take care of her, the way I wanted to. Listen, no Martin is gonna do any favors for me. 'Albert?' Yes, sir. It was just like a miracle, that's what. From the minute Albert here told me you boys were building us a railroad.. ...I started getting better. Well, that's wonderful, Mrs. Hawkins. But we are not actually building a railroad. We're just laying the route out for it. Same thing. I think it's wonderful. Your sister doesn't agree with you on that. Even if she is your sister, my dear.. ...that Clara Martin is the meanest woman that ever wore shoe leather. I can't understand why your father listens to her. I can't either. But it's been that way ever since I can remember. Clara's been running everything for dad except the ranch for years. Have you tried to talk to him about it? I mean, about the way your sister has managed to put everybody in the community into debt. Yes. But he won't pay any attention to me. He's, well, he's kind of stubborn. He's not mean, but he just doesn't care about business at all. He spends all of his time on the ranch. 'Well, I don't think he's been in town for years.' That's right, he hasn't. He lives like one of them Chinese kings on that ranch of his. I've been thrown off a dozen times by his hired hands when I tried to go see him. That must be Clara's doing. Well, I wouldn't be surprised. Tell you what, Frances. Suppose you ride out with Dave and I to your father's ranch 'maybe we can talk some sense into him.' I think that's a wonderful idea. Officially, of course.. ...we're only interested in completing the survey without anymore interference. But it would be nice if we can straighten out a few other things at the same time. Unofficially, I'm interested in plenty other things. Bye, see you soon. Thank you, Mr. Connors. - Dave's the name. - We'll keep you posted. What are you in such a hurry about? Good morning, Mr. Martin. No hurry. I'm just giving the horse a little exercise. - Well, don't overdo it. - Yes, sir. What's up? Why aren't you at the patch? The kid's riding in here with those two surveyors. Well, you'd better ride into town and tell Miss Martin right away. Ask her what she wants us to do about 'em. Alright, I will. Dad, I'd like you to meet Mr. Wilson and Mr. Connors. - Howdy, men. - Glad to meet you, Mr. Martin. - Same here. - These men are surveyors, Dad. Yeah. What are they doing now? Making a new state boundary or something? No, we work for the Central Valley Railroad. A railroad? W-well, where are you figuring on building a railroad around here? Down the middle of the Big Valley west of here and through Martinsville. What do you wanna do that for? I don't need a railroad. 'Well, maybe that's true.' But this part of the country needs one. At least the government thinks so. 'Well, you go back and tell them they're wrong.' I own every foot of that valley. And I know more about it than they do. Dad, you don't exactly own the land, you know. You have a grazing permit. That's all. Well, it's the same thing. Been grazing my cows there for 30 years. Well, the governor of the state told me himself, it was my land. Nobody'd ever try to take it away from me. He said. I told him nobody better try. And nobody has. I even let the homesteaders live there. Plenty of room for everybody. I'm not a greedy man. Now according to some-- He was right, Mr. Martin. Nobody wants your land. And the government won't ever rescind your grazing permit either. The country needs your beef herds. But since the land itself really belongs to-- Oh, uh, gentlemen this is my eldest daughter, Clara. She runs all my affairs. We've met. Well, well, what a pleasant surprise. Uh, did you get our message last night? Frances, you know better than to bring strangers out here. Especially troublemakers like these two. They're not the troublemakers. You are. You and your hired cruel-- How dare you speak to me like that? Father, do I have to stand for this? Now, Frances, you know I don't like you to be disrespectful to your sister. Apologize now. No, I won't apologize. Dad, please don't listen to her. She's just trying to cause trouble-- I won't have you talking like that, Frances. Now, either you apologize or I'll s-- Frances, come back here! Father, we really ought to send her away to some school. Maybe they could teach her a few manners. I can't do a thing with her anymore. Yeah. I think you're right, Clara. We'll discuss it later. Oh, uh.. What's the trouble with these two men? You said something about-- Well, they started a fight in the saloon not ten minutes after they were in town. And beat up two of our men. There's nothing wrong with that. What was all this talk about a railroad? That's what I wanna know. 'We're making a survey through the valley, Mr. Martin.' We didn't come here to ask you your permission. We just want you to cooperate. I started to tell you before that the government owns that land and not you. I suggest you restrain your men from interfering with us anymore. I don't know what you're talking about. But I will tell you this much. If I don't want a railroad through my land, there won't be one. - I haven't made up my mind yet. - You will. As soon as I explain to you what will happen to all our business. - The railroad will ruin it. - It will not. It'll just give you some honest competition. Listen, you two. If my daughter tells me a railroad will hurt my business, she's right. I don't wanna hear any more about it. You won't. Not until you wake up some morning and see the engine turn across the valley. Come on, Whip, we're not getting anywhere here. Yeah, I can see that it's useless to argue with either of you. I just wanna warn you though, leave us alone. Who did it? Do you know them? Nah, they have masks on. But I recognized one of 'em. It was that no good Mooney, Martin's crooked freight agent. And another was, was Randall, the bartender. I'm pretty sure. Every one of our instruments is busted. This all happened on account of us, Mr. Hawkins. Martin's gang knew you were on our side and they're making you suffer for it. Well, I'm glad you weren't hurt. Don't worry about us, Whip. I'll get some other men together. We got some shootin' to do. You figure on smoking Martin out on his own ranch? Right. We might lose a few doin' it. But it's either that or get run out one at a time. The way we figure, we either fight for our land or quit. And even if we die for it, it's better than giving up. Wait a minute. Martin's got a great advantage. He's always had. We aim to cut him down to our size. Listen to me, this is all wrong. Even if you do succeed in killing Martin you won't get what you're after. And you'll be outlaws, all of you. Yeah, maybe we will. At least we'll be free of the old-- You'll be risking your own lives. The only way you can get real security is help us get this survey finished. But how can you do that if they keep busting up your instruments? Oh, we'll get some new ones in a few days. In the meantime, your friends can help a lot. Some of them must have some old telescopes that I can use. I'll work with them, while Dave rides for some new ones. Sure. I can make it to Dodge City and back in two days by changing horses along the way. I think you could at that. There's a lot of big horse ranches between here and there. They'll all honor a company paper. You're right again. That's the second time you stopped me from making a dang fool out of myself. You better stick around here. Well, so long, Dave. And don't take any chances. - See you soon. - Good luck. Alright, boys. Pick your spots on the hillsides. And make sure your horses are out of sight. And no smoking. I don't want any of you to be seen until I tell you to start shooting. How are we doing, Whip? Pretty good, considering. We're doing as well as can be expected with this tired equipment. Dave ought to be here before long. Good! 'They'll never know what hit 'em.' That's a mistake, Clara, we'll never get away with it. Why not? Not one of 'em will be left alive to tell what happened. But the government will surely send investigators out here. Let them. They'll never find a trace of anything when we're through. Now come on, let's get out of sight. Crawford, bring me my horse. Where in tarnation is everybody this morning? Crawford! Frances, I thought I told you to stay in your room. Let me go, dad. I've got to get a gun. A gun? What for? Who you gonna shoot? Nobody. I have got to warn Whip and Dave. They're gonna be ambushed and killed if I don't. Good. By whom? By yourmen. Dad, if you don't stop them, I will. Oh, so that's where everybody is. Dry-gulchin' isn't in my line. I never shot a man in the back in my life. Whose idea was this anyway? Crawford's? Of course not. It was Clara's. Will you stop her, dad? You go get my horse, I'll get my gun. They're getting in range, Miss Martin. I'll let you know when to fire. Now get back to you spot. It's Connors. He'll never see us if everybody keeps hidden. Let him through. We can't risk a shot now. It must have been Macklin shooting him. That fool. - That shot came from the hills. - Yeah. Look. Be under cover, men. Clara, your father's comin'. Clara, what's going on here? Heard you was figuring on dry-gulching those surveyors. We were. Macklin ruined it for us. They're all out of site now, we're really in for it. Clara, I don't mind the gunfight but you shouldn't go in for bushwhacking. Especially with the railroad fellas. We don't wanna be fighting the cavalry. That's what I told her, Mr. Martin. But it's too late now. Connors is already dead. Dave's dead? 'That's right, down on the trail somewhere.' Clara.. ...you've got us into trouble. But don't worry, we'll get out of it. Where's the other one? We better take care of him so he can't go running back to the government. Down there with a half dozen homesteaders. All armed. - They must have got Dave. - Maybe. But I'm gonna find out. Ah, there they are. These things will pick out ever man up there. So will the old telescope. Tell each man to use 'em. Pick out a target. When I give the signal, pin 'em down. I gotcha. We'll blow the tops-- No, I don't want anyone shooting to kill. I just want them pinned down. Understand? What about Dave? That's my problem. If they've done anything to Dave, I'll take care of it. But right now, I want to settle this without anymore bloodshed if it can be done. I'm going up and talk to that man Martin. - Alone? - That's right. Now get going. Martin! Max Martin! There's Wilson. This will take care of him. Hold it, Clara. He's saying something. Listen. 'Martin!' Come on out. I wanna talk to you! I'll meet you halfway up the hill. It's a trick. Don't do it. It's no trick. If he's not afraid of our men, I'm not afraid of his. I'll go talk to him. Tell the boys to hold their fire. Crawford! 'Pick yourself a good spot on the hill.' 'Wait until my father finishes' 'talking to Wilson before you start shooting.' And don't miss. We can't afford to let Wilson stay alive no matter what my father decides. Well? I won't waste your time, Mr. Martin. You and your men can't stop progress. You're foolish to try. I did my best to explain to you how a railroad here would help you and all your neighbors instead of hurting you. But you wouldn't listen. Well, I'm finishing this survey whether you like it or not. If I fail, someone else would come along and do it. What do you mean someone else? The United States cavalry maybe? That's possible, too. Now, are you willing to talk this thing over sensibly? Without shooting? And save a lot of lives? Talking won't help, Wilson. My daughter Clara tells me a railroad will ruin all my business. Well, it's time you stopped letting that daughter of yours run your affairs and looked into them yourself. You'd be surprised what you'd find. That's all I ask you to do. Just talk to some of the farmers and ranchers who are your neighbors. You'll find out how your freight agency your stores, and your bank have almost starved them to death. Oh, you're crazy. I never starved anybody in my life. Well, your daughter has. Now the homesteaders are all down there. Covering every one of your men. They're ready to die if they have to, defending their land. I've held them back so far, but I won't be able to much longer. Well, I'm not afraid of them. I know that. And they're not afraid of you anymore, either. Now, this whole thing can only end in what amounts to wholesale murder. On both sides. Well.. Maybe some of the things you've been telling me make sense. I'll look into it. I'm making no promises, mind you. But I'll investigate it. Thanks, Mr. Martin. You're a good man. You're pretty sandy yourself. Wait a minute. Just one more thing. What about my partner Dave? They tell me one of my men shot him. I didn't order it. Well, this job comes first. But when it's finished, I'll settle with the man who did it. You can tell him that. Wherever he goes, I'll settle with him. Dave, I thought you were dead. Oh, no. It, it just creased me a little bit, that's all. That must have been Connors. Macklin didn't finish him. Wait a minute, Clara. I promised Wilson there wouldn't be any more shooting. I don't care what you told him. Men, get Connors! Then cut down on those homesteaders. Clara! Hold your fire, men. Pin 'em down, men. Wilson must've double crossed you. I've had enough of this. We haven't got a chance against those telescopes. I'm quittin'. Frank, have you seen Benson? Sure, he hightailed it out of here some time ago. Hold your fire, men. 'Looks like they've had enough.' Look, there's Dave and Frances. Hiya, partner, give me a rifle. You won't need it. What's the rush? Clara, I'm glad you're alright. I bet you are. What's in the saddlebags, Arnold? All the cash in the bank. I'm doing what we should have done long ago. 'I was on my way out to get you and--' Oh, sure. Sure. Is that why you were so careful to sneak out without my seeing you? 'Oh, no, you're wrong, Clara, I couldn't find you' 'in all the excitement. Clara, don't--' Now that's a pretty sight, isn't it? That was a good idea of mine building a railroad across the valley, huh? Yes, sir. Sure glad you thought of it. I think of all the pretty girls on that train and I'll probably never get to meet any of em. Oh, well, that's life. Never mind the philosophy, dear boy come in and help me with the dishes.
