[techno music] ♪ [horns honking] - I haven't really thought about this until recently, and I had this teacher at Yale named Michael Warner, and I just read his book called The Trouble with Normal that's now about 10 or 11 years old. But he's talking about... gay marriage, you know, ten years ago. And now, it's become an even bigger topic. And his argument is, you know, of course, you know... we like to think that, you know, we should have equal rights for everyone and this kind of thing, but one thing that it's doing that maybe people aren't looking at is normalizing, you know, a queer lifestyle that actually is incredibly valuable. And then it's also going to make-- if it becomes legal nationally, what will happen is then pressure will be put on anybody that's, you know, living a gay lifestyle to get married. Like, okay, we granted it. Now everyb-- you're going to be--ev-- you know, you're going to be expected to get married just like straight people, and if you're not, then there's, you know-- - There's a fear that the hunger and the race for things like gay marriage and, like, the assimilation into straight culture is erasing all of the radicalness and the queerness of, you know, that sort of world. I like what you're saying, especially in terms of what we're creating here, because I think it's-- I think it helps to inform choices. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. You know everyone. - Hi, everyone. - Hey. Travis. - Hi, Travis. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - How's it going? - Going good. All right. - Good. - Hey. Hey. - Hi. - It's beyond our grasp for a lot of reasons with, like, time and money and all of it to actually try and diligently and earnestly try and re-create this as if it were, like, real 40 minutes cut from it and people would think that that's really what it was. So I think even trying to do that is just, like, a wrong way to go. So this is more like our reimagined idea of it. So it's a little bit-- There's room to be fluid with your interpretation of that character. - Good. Good. - Yeah. Yeah. - 'Cause, yeah, the idea of playing Al Pacino is-- it's, like, a whole different ballpark than, you know, playing this role. - Sure. - Right? - Maybe just do kind of Pacino. Do you know what I mean? Not SNLPacino, but just sort of, like, "esque," Pacino-esque. - His kind of maybe-- Did you just get a haircut? - Yeah. For Oz. - Nice. - I'm not suggesting that you need to have sex with anybody, and I'm not going to ask you to have sex. I'm not going to push that. I mean, it's not really part of my agenda. But I do think that it's interesting and important on some level to show you have some struggle with... your acceptance of this, and-- - [laughs] You might as well call cut... - Can you-- - And put this on the thing, 'cause this is it right now. - Yeah. [laughter] - I don't personally like this project, personally. It doesn't--I don't--nothing artistic in it right now. Maybe it's 'cause of my lack of understanding of what it is. Doesn't respond to it. What I do respond to and always have is his mission. Like, I like James' mission. I don't always understand it, but I like--I like it. I like what he's doing even when I don't understand it, and I'm into supporting it and being a part of it. So I guess what my question is, is this something that we, as the artists working on it, are going to manipulate to make a certain point, or do you just want it to be what is? - I want you to basically cruise the camera. - Okay. - Just do that until I tell you to stop. - I don't know exactly what you mean by that. - Like, without saying anything, I want you to act like this is a guy that you're, like, cruising. - Okay, okay. [laughs] - You can pretend that he's 2 feet from your face, or you can pretend that he's a little bit further down the road. - Okay. - Not down the road, but across the bar. - All right. - But I want you to look into the camera. - Look into the camera. - Yeah. - Okay. - So pretend it's-- he's either right here... - Gotcha. - Or he's further away, but look into the camera. - Okay. - I've always been a huge fan of Cruising, ever since I discovered it a few years ago. And I try to live the gay dream, and I think that the people in that time period were just living this gay dream that was so spectacular, that I try to live it in my life as much as possible now, and when roles like this come along, I feel like it's just the perfect thing. - I've only gone just back-- just gone back to acting, and I thought this would be a cool kind of first credit to get, and also, it just seems kind of hot. I hope I get to make out with Franco. That's--[laughs] - The reason why I want to be in this project is to explore something that I'm afraid of. That's the reason why. - Should be pretty hot. Yeah, I've never really been on camera before like this, so I'm a little nervous, and I imagine I'll be kind of anxious. But I'm sure everyone's, like, really comfortable and nice, so I'm looking forward to it. - Well, I'm interested in this because I'm excited to work on something out of the box. I feel like in this town, everything is so proper and the same, and it's cheesy, and it's usually very boring. So I like things to shock people and to move them and, you know, something that's original at least. And work with you guys-- you and James Franco-- that's really exciting to me, of course. - I think that the atmosphere on the day of the shoot is going to be sexually charged. I think there's going to be a lot of tension. I know that there's a bunch of straight guys in the cast, and I don't know how they're going to react to the vibrating homosexuality that's going to be all around them. But I think it's going to be awesome. - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - Hi, baby. I'm still in bed, but I hope you're shaking it over there. [groans] Hey, remember, don't take it, give it. [chuckles] Anyways, I want to make sure you're home by 8:00 tonight 'cause I have dinner reservations. All right, love you. - Yo, what's going on, man? I know you're at the Franco faggot project today, and I got to tell you, man, I don't know where your head is on this, and I really think we need to talk about this right away. Please call me as soon as you get this. - Awesome. Great. We're good. - Cool, man. - Thanks for taking some time. I'm going to hand you over to Iris. I appreciate it. That was really awesome. - Thanks, Travis. - Okay, talk to you later. Bye. - See you. - Hi. - Good morning. - You're Val. - Are you Val? - Hey, I'm Michael. - I knew it. - Hi, Michael. Val. - Nice to meet you. - Hey. - Hello. Welcome. - How you doing? - How you doing? - Doing good. - Good. Good, good, good. Get comfortable. - Okay. - I'm going to do something with those guys right there, and then I'll be around in a second, okay? - All right. [sirens wailing in the distance] - Jay. - Val. - Yeah. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Jay. [airplane flying overhead] [indistinct chatter] - So I want you guys to meet each other. So this is Master Avery. This is A.J. - Hi. A.J. - Hey, A.J. How are you? - Nice to meet you. - And... - Good. - I want-- - Oh, sorry. [laughs] - So you guys are going to have a scene together, like, early on. You're going to have, like, a sex scene together. There will be other people involved. - Mm-hmm. - But I want to film you guys talking about the negotiating of what this scene will be. - Okay. - I think you both have read sort of, like, what we have outlined there right now. - Yeah. - But what I-- - Yeah, so you're going to be sucking somebody off? - Someone's-- - Sucking you off? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, got ya. Okay. Okay, and then we have this little play while someone worships my boots. - Yeah. - All right. - Kind of negotiate where your boundaries are, what you have in mind, what you're proposing. But I want you to do something that's visual. Like, maybe it's, like, some sort of, like, bound-hand visual thing, as you're describing it to him... - Uh-huh, Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Because it's something that I want you to repeat when we have you with Val in a different scene, like the visual piece. - Uh-huh, like, of the negotiating? - Yeah. So there's a scene that's going to be, technically, in the very end of the film, where you guys-- You and Val are again at the bar, and the music's loud, and we can't hear what you're saying, but we're going to see your body language. - Right. - And I'm hoping that there can be body language that we see here with you two that's mirrored with you-- - Like, I use it every time I negotiate. - Yes. Exactly. - Sure, okay. - So one of my coworkers, her cousin, I guess, is James' assistant, and that's kind of how this happened. - That's cool. I'm curious if James is going to be here. - I'm not sure. - He's here. - Oh. - No, I think he's an artist who really is interested in-- in the nooks and crannies. - The range of human experience. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, totally. - Nice. - From reading his, like, HuffPost stuff and-- - I suppose people will be-- the gays will be excited for Franco. - Titillated. - Yeah. - Definitely. - Hopeful. - Doing a gay porno thing. - They're probably hoping he's going to be naked in it. - Probably, yeah. - We are, yeah. Speak for me too. both: Yeah. [laughter] - I mean, yeah. Everybody's going to want to see him naked, but I think that there's going to be a whole segment of our community that is going to be angrily waving signs and writing blog posts about, "Why is this straight dude touching this?" - Maybe that's part of the point, though, 'cause, like, if you think about the original production of Cruising,right? - The ones who would protest probably are the ones who have the most kink inside of them and are suppressing it or are afraid of experiencing or exploring something because of their own fear of being judged. But anybody who is cozy with themselves and all the stuff is probably going to be cool with it. - Yeah, I'm curious to see what's going on with this thing, just as far as, like, how it's going to reference Cruising, 'cause I didn't know that that was the deal, but clearly, that's what's going on here. - When did you find out about this project? - About two weeks ago. It was just, like, an email that went around, 'cause Franco used to go to Playhouse West, and he's still involved. - Right. - So it was just like, "Yeah, guys, come out for a gay-bar scene." - Interesting. - And they asked me how far I could go, and I honestly said, like, "Everything but sex." I mean, I don't mind kissing and, you know-- - Are you gay? - No. That's the thing, it's like-- but as an actor, I feel like you-- I don't-- I remember 30 people came, and they all left the theater, because they were shocked. - Really? - Yeah. I was like, "I don't get it." If you're an actor and you don't want to kiss a guy, I mean, if that's your limit, I don't understand. - So what do you think? Are you uncomfortable? - I mean, I'm a little uncomfortable just 'cause I don't know exactly, you know, what I'm doing. - Mm-hmm. - But it's cool, I mean, I'll figure it out, but-- You know, what exactly am I doing? - It sounds like Al Pacino was uncomfortable when he did it. - Did he have a script? [laughs] - Fuck scripts. Just go in there and, you know, just kind of fit in. Get down with what's going-- [laughs] - And just try and fit in. - What's going down? - I don't know, just-- as if it's, like, a club, you know? [laughs] Right? If you're undercover, that's the key. - Yeah, yeah. What-- What am I fitting into? I'm just-- You know, it's a club. A club. - Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think-- - I'm having a drink. I'm having a smoke. - Yeah. Exactly. - Checking it out. - Exactly. Yeah, I mean, what is there to fit into? I don't know. Probably easy. Just fit in. [laughs] - All right. - But you can't get found out. [laughs] You got to stay undercover. - Not a belt, but what would you call this? - Yeah, that's, like, a paddle, but call it a throng. Yeah, it's kind of like inner--inner-- - An in-between thing? - An in-between kind of thing. Yeah, I just call it a paddle, but it's more like a strap. A leather strap. - Okay, great. Basically, we're going to be in this general area. It's not--doesn't matter right now how specific it is. There's going to be some people around here. There's going to be this guy down here, and he's going to leave your cock, and then he's going to worship your boots. I mean, basically, you're coming over here, so Val can see you come over here, 'cause he rebuffed you when you had a moment with him just a second ago. - Okay. - You're basically going to submit to what he wants. - Okay. - Okay? And the bottom line for me is that we have something that-- I don't know if this is too extreme of a thing to use, but it's got to be something visual that is, like, hitting him, like, on his ass--on his-- [Marty Robbins' El Paso] [music cuts off] - How are you feeling about this? - I'm okay with it. - Yeah? I mean... - Yeah. - We're clearly not going to do anything that's actually hard. - Yeah, I know. I know. - Yeah, Yeah. Okay. - I trust you guys. - Your name is Val? - Yeah. - How did you get involved, Val? - James Franco asked me to come do this. He said that they're doing this project, and he wants-- they want to reenact-- they're trying to reimagine the 40 minutes that was cut out of Cruising. - Cruising? - Yeah, did you ever see that movie? - Never. - It's a movie with Al Pacino, and William Friedkin directed it. - Okay. - And 40 minutes of the movie was cut out 'cause the rating board wouldn't let them keep it. - Okay. - So they said they're reimagining what that 40 minutes was. - Okay. - And would I come-- you know, would I come do it? - Mm-hmm. - So that's how I got involved. - Are you the Pacino character? Is that a real cigarette? - Yeah. You want one? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Can you light that for me? I can't fit a lighter in my disco pants. [laughter] - Do you mind if we smoke in here, sweetie? - Oh, I don't care. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I ask you a personal question? - Absolutely. - Are you straight? - I am straight. Funny thing--so this morning I get a call from Iris, right? She calls me up, I look at my phone, it's a 510 number. I'm like, "Who the hell is this?" Right? It's, like, 7:00 in the morning, 7:30. I'm at a girl's house, okay? So one second, I'm at the girl's house and looking at my phone, get a voice mail telling me I'm supposed to be here on set, get my makeup did--done, and I thought it was pretty strange, like, the whole-- I don't know. It was strange. I was coming from this woman's house, this young woman's house, coming to get dressed up as a drag queen. She had no idea at all, but-- I thought it was pretty interesting, though. So, yeah, I am straight, if that answers your question. - Have you played a homosexual guy before? - Never. - How do you feel about it? - I feel good. I feel good. Do you feel good? - Yeah. Yeah, you don't know what you're going to be doing today? - I know I'm going to be sporting a platinum-blonde wig and rocking some high heels here in a minute. - Are you comfortable with physical contact with, like, other dudes? - How much physical contact? - I guess whatever would be realistic inside of a gay S&M club. - I mean, if it happens, it happens. - Would you kiss another guy? - If it was--If it was-- If it was correct, if it was right in the moment, yeah. I wouldn't force it, 'cause then it would look stupid, but if it was right, I mean, yeah, why not? If it was right, yeah. - Have you kissed a guy before? - I haven't. So we're both, like, virgins to this? - I guess so, yeah. I mean, I don't-- Yeah, I guess so. - And you're the Pacino character? - Kind of. I mean, not exactly. I'm kind of playing the character that Pacino was playing in the original movie. - Okay. Are you a Pacino fan? - He's my favorite actor. - Is he? - Yeah. - Okay, what's your favorite Pacino movie? - Maybe Scarecrow. - Scarecrow? - Yeah. - I haven't seen that one. What's the one with him-- I think my favorite Pacino movie is-- Shoot. Panic in Needle Park. - His first one--second one. - Yeah, I like that one. I like that one a lot. That was a good one. - That's how he got The Godfather. - I did not know that. - Francis Ford Coppola saw about 12 minutes of dailies... - Oh, okay. - From Panic in Needle Park before the movie came out. - Got it. - And he watched those dailies, and he said, "That's the guy I want for Michael." - What's a daily? - Close your eye. - Dailies are, like... [clears throat] the day's sh-- the results of that day's shooting, like, just the scenes-- just the shots back-to-back, unedited, raw kind of footage of the stuff that was shot on that workday. That's a daily. - Hmm. Okay. I didn't know that. - Collin, throw him back some of the same questions he asked you, in terms of, like, you know, you guys talked about being straight and being on this. One question he asked you was, has he ever-- "Have you ever played a gay guy?" - Have you ever played a gay guy? - But wait, wait till I'm done talking, so it's clean. - Got it. - So just ease into that. - Okay. You're telling me about dailies, which means you've probably been doing this a lot longer than I have, so you've probably done more characters or more scenes or whatever. Have you played a gay guy? - Yeah. - You have? - Just lately. Yeah, I played Sal Mineo. - Was that tough? - It was tough to play him, not because he was gay, but just, you know, to kind of get his-- - Mm-hmm. 'Cause it's different from, like, how you are, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. I can imagine. Honestly, I have no idea why James would want to do this. I haven't even seen him yet. I don't even know him. I've only seen him in films. How long have you known him? - 15 years. - 15 years? Holy shit. - We started Playhouse together. - Oh, awesome. That's amazing. I've only been at Playhouse for, like, two months, to be honest with you. - Yeah, I'm not sure exactly why he wants to make the movie-- why he wants to make this. - Mm-hmm. - I have an idea. - What's your idea? - I think it's about-- - 'Cause I'm really fucking curious, so please inform me. - I think it's about the right to have the freedom to express your artistic kind of aspirations to tell a story or to not have limits on creativity and that maybe if it's coming from an artistic place, that nothing should be taboo. - Mm-hmm. - I think--I think-- The stuff that they cut out was people actually having sex. It was-- Gay or straight, I think people were actually fucking, so-- - [laughs] - You know what I mean? - Are people fucking today? - I don't know. - You're not. - No. - I don't think I am. - Can you look up for me? - Yeah. - Would you? - Probably not. I mean, if you want my honest-- my honest-- I could lie and be all like, "Yeah, I would," but honestly, probably not, no, unless I was getting paid a hefty sum. Would you fuck for-- without getting paid? - I wouldn't fuck, period. [indistinct chatter] - We're doing--we're doing-- We're doing the wide that's going to not have Val dancing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. - So do you know how to do this? Okay, so basically-- It's basically, like, you can just be, like-- - Oh, okay. - Okay. - But we need to take some of this liquid out. That's fine, I just don't want him to have, like, actual water go into his nose. - Sure, yeah. - I just need to get right-- - Fine. - Giving him enough attention, but not so much that he knows? - Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah. Is everybody in here now? Are all of the guys for the bar scene in here? Okay, so one thing I want to say is, so much about this is about the cruising, the watching, the looking. So it's so much about your guys' eyes. So you're always-- You know, unlike 2012, people aren't buried into their phones or buried, like, in something. They're, like-- You guys are looking around. You're looking for somebody basically to have some action with. [indistinct chatter] And when you're dancing-- so we want to have-- One of the things we want are layers, so I want you guys to not be in a line and some of you to be on the other side of me. You're not quite against the wall. You'll be here dancing. Okay, that's perfect. While that's happening, you two are looking at each other. [indistinct chatter] And then maybe one more person dancing. Are you in this? Why don't you be back here, and you know that you're hot shit, and you've got, like, a hot-shit outfit on or a minimal hot-shit outfit on, and you're kind of-- you're waiting for somebody to come over and cruise you, but you're sort of cruising the room to see who's going to come your direction. - Yeah. - You can handle that. - Sounds good. - Okay. - Okay, and then do we want anyone walking through either way? - Yeah. [indistinct chatter] - I can't see--like, I can't-- Like, I can't--I just can't. My head's too big to see. - It's the other way. You put it on the wrong way. - It's not working. - Show him how to do it, Iris. - Yeah, baby. - I can't. - Yo, come on. - I literally am, like, sweating, and like, freaking out. You want me to do it, I'll do it. - Yeah, baby. - You really want me to do it? - Yeah, baby. - If I faint, it's on your head. - Does anyone else need water? - Yeah. - He wants me to tell you it's hard to breathe. It's a pretty intense mask. - Really? - Yeah. - Someone's going to have to be with him to, like, make sure he doesn't-- - Okay, yeah, just stay with him, or whoever Travis wants with him. Hey, Travis? [indistinct chatter] - Okay, you guys. Okay, go. [indistinct chatter] - I write, like, short stories and stuff. - Yeah. - What about you? What do you do? Like, full-time? - Thanks. [laughter] Thanks, man. - Okay, uh-- - Stand right there. - That's a little bit better. - What temperature is that? - That's a good color. - Okay. - Can we roll camera? - Yep. - Okay, we're going to slate next to James here real fast. - Stand by, guys! - Okay. So sound speed. Roll cameras. - Rolling. - Rolling. [A Place to Bury Strangers' I Lost You] ♪ [paddle smacking] - [moaning] Thank you! [moaning] - Lick those boots. [paddle smacking] - [moaning loudly] - Mmm. Yeah, boy. - Yeah, okay, great. - Break for lunch? - Yeah, lunchtime. - Sweet. Thanks, everybody. [applause] - Would it feel different if it was a guy and a girl in there? - Yeah, it wouldn't be-- - Why? - It wouldn't make it okay. - Why? - Why would it feel different for me? - Yeah. - I guess I'd be a little more used to it, so it'd feel different, but I still wouldn't want to be in a fucking regular porno, gay or fucking not. - Well, here's how I feel. I don't like the fact that I feel like I've been brought up to think a certain way. I don't like thinking that. I don't like realizing that my mind has been twisted by the way that the world has been set up around me, and what that is, is straight, normative kind of behavior. And it's fucking instilled into my brain. And it's-- Yeah, I'd say, you know, it was a little shocking to me at first when I'm watching that, but only-- I believe, only because of the world around me, because every fucking toilet-paper commercial has a guy--a man and a woman living in a house together, and every fucking love story is a dude that wants to be with a girl. And the only way they're going to end up happy is if they walk off into the sunset together. I'm fucking sick of that shit, so if there's a way for me to just break that up in my own mind, I'm all for it. And that's, I think, why you want to be an actor and be an artist. - You think that this should be, like, in movies and people should be able to see it and-- - Yes! Fuck, yes! - But-- - Yes, sex should be a tool, a storytelling tool, but we're so fucking scared of it. Everybody talks about sex, but then don't dare put it in a movie. It's like, what the fuck? Or you're allowed to talk about it in certain ways, like fucking locker-room humor or frat-house kind of humor, but, oh, don't show gay sex. Don't do that. That's the fucking devil. Show--in previews, show people getting fucking blown away and killed, but don't show gay sex. - They do show fucking gay sex. They show it in, like, rated-X theaters. - They sh--yeah! Put it in the fucking mainstream. [laughter] - Why? - To help tell stories! It's a great fucking tool. It's what--It's who we are. Everybody has sex. Everybody thinks about sex all the fucking time. We can't fucking put it in movies? We can put fucking people killing each other... - Sex is in the movies. - Strangling each other, murdering each other? - There's sex in fucking movies everywhere. - In a certain way. - Yeah, because you know-- - Not--not-- it's--it's fetishized. It's turned into, you know-- - Something a little more tame for people, right? Something a little more palatable for-- - Well, why don't they give us violence in a little more palatable way and amp up the sex? That's what I say. - Because people like it. - People like sex! - Yeah, but they go to-- - Everybody's fucking watching porn. They just don't want to talk about it. They just don't want to talk about it in public. Everybody fucking watches porn. There's nothing wrong with it. People have sex. What's wrong with what we just saw? - It's too much, dude. - Everybody does it. - It's in bad taste. - Well, we shot it in a tasteful way. - I don't care how you fucking shoot it. - What do you mean? You just said "bad taste." - The act itself is in kind of-- It's too much. Like, what about leaving something to the fucking imagination? Like-- - It's not a porn for titillation. It's something else. We're telling a story. - What story are we telling? I don't know what fucking story we're telling. - About a guy who's uncomfortable, goes undercover into this world. And in the original movie, it was as if he was going down into a deep, dark place. He was going into an evil place. That's the way they depicted it, whether Friedkin intended to or not, by giving it a backdrop of murder, he was going into a dark, deep, evil place, and he had to go "undercover" and be gay undercover. We're doing that. You're playing a guy who's going undercover, but to me, he's not going to a dark, evil place. He's going to actually a place that's, I think, beautiful and attractive. - That's beautiful and attractive? - I think so. - I got a lot of fucking respect for you, and I hope, like, you're being careful. That's all, because-- I'm all for, like, saying what you want to say and doing what you want to do, but, you know, there's repercussions at the end of the day. And you're doing some amazing shit out there, and things like this can, you know-- You're fucking starring in a Disney movie, for Christ's sake. - Mm-hmm. - You know, it's hard to have this conversation with you, because 70% of me is on your side, because I think the same way about the things that I believe. I guess I just don't see what you're seeing, so I'm tripping out a little bit. That's all, 'cause I don't-- I don't have the insight, or, really, I don't care to prove the point that you're making, so I'm not sure what the fuck is really going on. - I don't either. - Huh? - I don't know fully what's going on. It's about being here. It's about doing this, experiencing this, just putting ourselves out there. That's half of it, just doing it. And being in a Disney movie and doing it. That's what's giving it half of its power. - Excuse me. - So I think you're going to have to get up. - Yeah. - So we've got this, we have-- We need another chair, for sure, right? - We've got this chair and that chair. - Okay. Travis. Oh, there you are. - Yes. [indistinct chatter] - Cut. Beautiful. Before we launch into-- [indistinct chatter] [dogs barking] - Hey, dude. - Yo. What's going on? - Nothing, I'm here on--on set. - Uh-huh. And? - And what? Dicks are out. Balls are out. People are paddling each other in the ass. There's bruises. There's fucking welts. Sucking, fucking, armpits, balls, assholes. Everything's out, dude. - Man, I got to tell you-- I don't fucking understand this. I don't know why you're there. I don't know why you're doing this again. - I'm doing it 'cause... fucking James wants to do this thing. He's got something to say, and he needs people to, you know, help him say it. - He needs people to what? - He is. He's in it. He's in it right alongside me. - Exactly, and he's a major, major actor. And you aren't. I'm just saying, you've done-- this is the third or fourth time you've been at the forefront of his expression, and it's always some fucked-up, radical thing. - Why does my instinct call me a dick? And if he's got something to say and he needs my help to say it, then fuck it, man, I'm going to help him say it. - All right, by that logic, then, if he wants you to go butt-fuck one of those guys in there because he wants to express something and you're in full support of that, why don't you go ahead and do that? - James thinks it should be drawn at a certain place. I think it should be drawn at a certain place. Fucking Facebook user number 3,000,054 thinks it should be drawn at a certain place. Who's to say? It's all subjective, man. I mean, what's he really fucking doing at the end of the day? He's expressing what he feels about sexual freedom. You know, people are-- Quentin Tarantino, fucking burning theaters down in his movies and shit. - There's a reason why this stuff doesn't play in mainstream theaters-- in any theaters other than pornography theaters. - It's a pornography set by my fucking standards, but what's bothering me is-- - You're the one that's in the center of all this thing. You're in the center of everything. This whole thing revolves around you. - He's got my back, dude. I trust him. - I'm just saying that at the end of the day, anyone watching this will consider it pornography. - Fuck 'em. - And you will be in it. - I was thinking for the scene-- because we've already gotten you guys at the bar and we've established that you guys were together and Master Avery was at the bar-- So I was thinking for this that it would be basically as if he brought you back to his apartment. both: Okay. - And he is kind of instructing you guys on what to do, or he's sort of, like, silently watching you guys as you guys have sex. - Okay. - Okay. - But the thing that's interesting about it to me is less about actually what's happening here and the fact that Val is watching it. - And all that we need is-- 'cause we can shoot this tight too, but all that we need is... - Is something-- - Just something bright behind it, just right here, so if we get, like, close on his face, it's not black. - How about we move this table with the lamp in there? - Well, we want--we want-- we want, like, behind him to not be black. - Yeah, nothing that would make too much of-- - You think this is funny, you know, and then he'll laugh, of course, again, and then you can be like, "No, this isn't funny." And then you can, you know, like, give him a little slap you know, on the face, you know, here. You shut him up, basically. You take charge. You don't want him to laugh. It's not funny to you. It is funny to him, but you're controlling him. And he's going to have to, like, listen, or else you're going to hurt him. You know-- - How do-- How do you feel about that? - I don't know, like, that's just not my--yeah. - It's sexy, because you know he wants it. And that's what's fun, because you know he wants it, and you got to play this part and, like, work it out in your head to be able to do it, 'cause he wants it. He's a, you know, laughing little boy here, thinks everything is funny, but he really wants to be put in his place, and he wants to behave. - My gosh. - You're missing that ring there. - Oh, that's what it needs. [indistinct chatter] - Shall we get rolling? - Yep. - All right, so roll sound. - Sound speed. - Scene--don't really know. Take one marker. - You like that? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Okay. - I wasn't, you know-- I wasn't-- Like, this is the third-- this will be the third film I've done, and it will be the third film I've done where I spend the entire thing naked. [laughter] So I really, like-- It's not what I wanted to do next, but-- - You must be good at it. [laughter] - Thanks, Ben. But seriously, like, I'm-- I'm trusting that it's going to be tasteful bondage art porn, you know, like, I-- - Done smartly? - Yeah. It's going to be smart. It's going to-- Like, I can already see that it is smart, you know? - I don't-- like, what was-- Like, what's the point of it all? You're, like-- - Ooh. - Yeah, do you guys even know? 'Cause I really can't quite figure out-- - I have zero clue. I mean, I was involved in so little. - You guys were involved in more. - You're friends with James, right? Like-- There's a purpose to it. - He's got a purpose to it, even if that purpose is to quench his own curiosity. - Yeah. - Sometimes you need help to do that, and here we are. We're all, you know... [laughter] Helping him do that and maybe-- I think I've learned something. I don't know what it is, but I'm definitely not the same guy I was when I came in here this morning. - Sure. - Do you have a girlfriend? - I'm married. - You're married? - Yeah. - What does your wife think about all this? - She's cool, man. She's-- She's a really cool girl. You know, she knows that I'm not taking part in any kind of, like, sexual things, but she just doesn't understand. She's like, "Well, I don't understand." And I found myself getting frustrated trying to explain it to her. - Yeah. - Really frustrated, and it became apparent that I don't fucking understand either. But she was cool, she just wants me to make it back in time to go to dinner tonight. [laughter] - I told my mom about it, and I could feel her stress through the phone. Like, she did not think this was a good idea for our relationship or my career or anything. Like, she, I think, is terrified. - You know what? You two were really sweet together, though. I mean, you just kind of were there in such a gentle, cool, kind of a supportive way. I could tell you're a couple. It was actually really, really nice. But I can see how people who care about us-- Just the idea-- Maybe that's it, man. Maybe it's the idea of things are so much fucking bigger than they actually are when you see them and do them. One thing's for sure. We're a sexy bunch. [laughter] That's for sure. Good-looking group of guys. - Hear, hear. - Where's my water? - Hey, it's James. Please leave a message. - Who's here? You're not here. Where the fuck you at? Where you at, James? Call me back. - How's it going over there? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Do I need to buy a strap-on now and give it to you? - Shut up. Don't be stupid. - Mm-hmm. - It's good to hear your voice. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It's good to hear your voice. So? - So? - Everything good? - Yeah, it's fine. - Okay. You're going to be home at 8:00, right? - Yeah, I should be home by 8:00, probably before. "Val sits against the wall in the parking lot. "Script is in his lap. "He reads to himself.
