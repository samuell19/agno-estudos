Ten year long endeavour. Six-year-old Company. Ten thousand crore turn over. Five thousand employees. And twenty thousand of their family members depending on them. They are all at stake overnight. The reason? Our twenty five year old dream to see a cancer free world. If an idea can solve this problem, I don’t know when it is going to strike. If it’s a person who can do it, I don’t know when he might arrive. Being swept away by floods, won’t I find at least a straw to hold on to? Won’t there at least be one man who could help? Sir, ready, sir! You invited the moon but did he come? No, no. No, no. You asked him to bring marigolds, did he? No, no. No, no. Is there a Mysore in Mysore Bajji? Enough now. Enough. Who would post sob stories on Insta? You are right. They act nice but their feelings are completely opposite. Govinda! Life is controlled by someone or the other, bro. He makes you sing a special number in the same play, bro That is what life is all about, Mawa bro. That is all there is to life, Mawa bro. You invited the moon but did he come? No, no. No, no. You asked him to bring marigolds, did he? No, no. No, no. Once you report to duty in the morning, spark… work like a spark. Fix all your pastime meetings after six. One mistake… One mistake and you are out. Remember that. -Like a diabetic patient -aha… -Managing a confectionary -Aha… Everything is within the reach but you own nothing, I swear. A crowd gathers around you every day seems a celebration Serve them with utmost care but your only gift will be rebuke You feel you are the hero of your story And you live on, Mawa bro Please hold on, Mawa bro Using you as a joker, They call for the show That is what life is all about, Mawa bro. That is all there is to life, Mawa bro. That is what life is all about, Mawa bro. That is all there is to life, Mawa bro. No matter how many clouds come, can they stop the sun on duty? Though the globe revolves around money, can it reduce a man’s worth? Mom! -Have fun! -Dad! -What happened, son? -Tell me, dear. Why did you give me such poor life that I cannot even try for the beautiful girl right before me? Why discuss our poor penury now? Did you like the girl so much? My heart was troubled as soon as I saw her, mom. The cooker at home is spoilt. First take a look at that. It’s real fun watching you, bro. But what is this mom and dad thing? Nothing, Mawa bro. I lost my mom to cancer very young. I was sent to an orphanage. That’s where I met this mom and dad. So, joy or sorrow… We share it among ourselves. Why did you call me so many times? Hey, one minute. Santosh, your order. Hey, you are burning with fever. Why did you come to work? I finished all my leaves last month. But now you have fever… -Excuse me. Where is my order? Why is it taking so long? Let me take it. Good evening, ma’am. Here is your Sangria. Enjoy your drink. What is this? -Ma’am? -What is this? The drink you had ordered, ma’am. You served me drinks without even knowing what I have ordered? Red wine sangria… That’s what you have ordered for, ma’am. Really? Is this what I ordered? This is my drink? Taste it! Where’s the manager? Oh! What’s happening? Uh, I am sorry, ma’am. What happened? There is no brandy in my drink. Krishna Das! What is this? Is this how you serve your customers? This is what happens when you hire from the streets. Is this what your twenty years of legacy Is all about? Sorry, ma’am. I am sorry. Your salary is not as much as their one bill. Do you understand that Krishna Das? Don't you know that you should be careful? Ma’am, I am really sorry for the inconvenience. I’ll…I will replace your drink. I've been telling you how to behave with customers, right? Say sorry to ma’am. Say sorry! -Sorry, ma’am. Sorry, ma'am. I'll make sure this won't happen again. 'This is what happens when you hire from the streets.' 'Your salary is not as much as their one bill.' It’s been like this since childhood. Bloody! It’s been the same since childhood. Other than both of you and me, has anyone ever spoken to us affectionately? Has anyone treated us like human beings? She might be rich... but we have our own self-respect. She said we are from the streets just because we are waiters? From the moment we report to duty, someone or the other keeps reminding us of our low lives. What’s new about this? We are born without money. But we should never die without money. How much will it cost to come and spend like her? Even our one-month salary will fall short. Let it cost us two months’ pay then. Let’s come as customers. Let’s see if they will treat us with respect at least then. Let’s come to the same hotel. I will buy this bloody hotel someday. Buddy, but we need proper clothes. If we become rich and build a shopping mall like this… -I will take care of parking. -I will work in the food court. Damn! With people like you around, no one can progress but remain a pauper. Fine. But how can we pull off being rich all of a sudden? Let’s do a rehearsal. Better. -Sir! -Tell me, Rangaiah. -My younger sister is getting married. -How much do you need? If you can spare a five hundred… You want to be cheap even in practice, Rangaiah? Ask for more. If you can help me with fifty thousand… Here. You told me to ask for fifty thousand but gave me only five hundred! And that’s my five hundred he gave you! Give it here. You have been working like a dog for me. No…as a cook for me for ten years. You said your sister’s getting married. Give her these clothes as a gift from her brother. But you are paying me salary, sir. I gave you life by giving you salary. Can’t I buy your sister clothes for her wedding, Rangaiah? You consider a cook’s sister as your sister! Hey, hey, hey! I don’t like all this in public, Rangaiah. Sir, you should give me change. It's okay. Keep it. Oh! Shit, shit… why are we sweating? Don’t these Five-star hotels maintain minimum ac? Cheap fellows! Hey, what is this attire? Where did you buy these cheap coats? Hey, don’t overdo it. You look like a tender coconut. I will break you and drink you up. Don’t waste time with cheap people you know. Hey, let it be. Don’t. Right, sir. It will be really helpful if you can extend the fifty-crore loan to me immediately. Okay, we shall meet tomorrow. We’ll meet. Thank you. Hello, sir. How are you? Uh, uh, I am fine, dear. I hope the hospitality is fine. Yeah, yeah. Fine. But take care of them. They are important to me. Definitely, sir. Don’t worry. I will take care of them. Hey, please don’t be cheap, man. -Cheaper than you? Hey, my manager, bro. -Yes, yes. They are keen on this project. And they are ready to extend the loan also. Ma'am. Your shift is over, right? What are you three doing here? Today, we want to enjoy like guests, ma’am. And of all the hotels you had to choose this? It’s not nice to spend the money we earned in this hotel on some other hotel, madam. Have your fun in the corner over there. We have clients here. Okay, ma'am. Don’t be so harsh, madam. Hey, forget it. Come. Who are they? -Uh, sir, they work here, sir. Waiter! Come here. Can I have the menu? You serve every day. Do you also need one? Oh, shit! Hey we spent a lot of money and came here as customers. Support us, Nagesh. Okay. Mexican tequila is 2999 rupees plus taxes. Very cheap. Get five tequilas. Five tequilas? Later, we will have to do all that Shakeela does in films to pay up Some people just don’t have the basic common sense. I have lost the mood and enthusiasm for the performance… uff… get three glasses of wine. Okay. That’s better. Hey, Nagesh, why don’t you pour a little more? That’s already more for you. Come on, cheers! Look. We drink only this tonight because we have no money to order more. Guys... somehow, I feel I can sing better than him. It’s too dangerous. Thank you all. Hi. We have a guest here who wants to perform a song for y'all. Come on, guys! It's my favourite song. Oh, my! He ruined the song! It's just a song. This is embarassing! Oh, my! Someone is crying. I hope you liked the song. Thank you. Why are they laughing? They have no taste. Where are my mom and dad? Hi. You sang very well. Huh? Thank you. Are you a professional singer? Nothing like that. I just sing whenever I feel like. Anyway, you sang well. And that was my favourite song too. Oh! Honestly, you sang well. Honestly, I thank you very much. Bye. Hey, Krishna! Hey, hey! What was that? She walked up to me. She struck a conversation. She gave me a hug herself. She reminded me how a great singer is being wasted as a waiter! Also, she came with someone but gave me a hug! I say this as your dad. This rich life deserves her as the rich wife. Otherwise, I will pick up a rich knife, stab myself richly and have a rich death. This is my rich promise. Rich! -Okay, bless me. May your wish be granted. May the girl be yours. She is leaving! Uh, don’t worry. If the girl is in love with you, she will turn back. She will… she will… Come. This way. I mean… she is with some guy. That’s why she didn’t look back. I will drop you. Why do you have to wait for the cab? No, no. It’s fine. Just come, come. I don’t want to come. I am waiting for the cab. -Come on! -Ajay! Please leave me. Let go. Please. Please! Don’t you understand what I am saying? -Keerthi, listen! -Ajay! -Come with me. I'll drop you. -Don’t make a scene! Leave me. -Keerthi. Boss! She doesn’t want to. Let her be. Don’t force her. Mind your own business. Go away! She said No, right? who the heck are you? I'll see your end. Move your vehicle. Hey. I will see how you will become a fashion designer. Yeah, like your pop owns fashion industry. Are you fine? Hmm. Yes, down it, down it. Today is ours! Hey, hey! My son is drinking up 2999 rupees plus taxes. Stop him! Your name? Keerthi. And you are? -Excuse me, sir? Yes. -One small doubt, sir. -Yes, tell me. 2999 plus taxes multiplied by two makes it how much, sir? Very simple. Do you have a phone in your pocket? Yes, sir. Take it out. Find the calculator and add up. Go. Don’t you have common sense to disturb like this? Two tequilas, dear. Should be very strong. You should remain strong when you see the bill. Hey, get lost! Go away. By the way, what are your hobbies? My hobbies? Cleaning vessels, taking tips. Huh? I am joking. Uh, singing…like before. Doing yoga, dancing. -Wow! Your hobbies? -Sir, I have just checked up, sir. -Mine... 2999 multiplied by six equals our salaries for January and February, sir. Not our salary… your salary. Not that, sir. Let us at least save January and February, sir. Hey, what do I care about your salaries? Excuse me. Is there a problem? No. My driver and my chef are requesting me for a raise. Repeat. Do you have a girlfriend? Huh? Do you have a girlfriend? What made you ask me this question? Actually…. Sir, you have crossed this year’s calendar and drank up five months of next year, sir. Please, sir. Try to understand. Are you jealous that a girl is talking to me? Go away. -He is shouting at us. -Repeat! I must tell you something. Tell me. Did you really think you sang well? Yeah. It was a good thing most of them are foreigners here. Don’t ever sing for our audience. Why not? They will thrash you. I can sing English songs too. Really? Justin Barber… Shikara I can sing you two sample songs if you want. One minute! Hey! Do you get it? A girl is talking to us. She is sitting with us and talking. We should do this every weekend. And I want to do it only with Keerthi. And we both have almost fallen for each other. Three of us have also fallen on the street now. Hey, money lost can be earned again, bro. What is lost can be earned. But you already spending money which is yet to be earned! Hey, it won’t take much effort to make millions if we really want. Do you remember the efforts we had to put in to get you the coat you are wearing? You guys are unbelievable. Hey, you are thinking like my friends. Think about it like parents. We don’t know if this is ever going to happen in my life again! Fine. If we were friends, we wouldn’t have approved. As parents… go ahead. -That’s what I was saying. -Okay. Guys, she has passed out. -This is a golden chance. Come here. She might wake up. -Where are you taking me? What do we do now? Hey, there is a guy in 408 who came from Rajasthan to attend a wedding here. He got ready and left for the wedding. He won’t be back before 11 tomorrow. Great. Bring the girl in the elevator. We will go get the room ready meanwhile. Why take some random room? Let’s book a room. Sell my kidneys and eyes to pay for it! Please, come up. The girl is still there. Let’s take her. Come. Let’s go and get the room ready, man. Let’s go. Careful, careful. Where are we going? Careful. Where are we going? Uh, you are over your head. You must rest. Why did you come there at the exact moment? Why did you hit him? Are you in love with me? Do you like me? I'm laughing after a long time. Thank you. “Jasmines chuckle in bed” -Here he comes. Here he comes! -Ssshh The brave warrior is here. -Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Hey, stop it. She's out. Shh… shh! Shut up. Come here. We have spent a lot already. At least enjoy yourself and do justice. Okay. Not just okay. Forget you are a gentleman today. Alright. Okay? Listen. Do you have the weapons? Weapons will find their own way to the war. Get out first. -Oh God! -I guess you watch too many movies? Good morning. Good morning. Did you book this room for me? No. This room is available for me through the year. I am rich. So, that’s how it is. Okay. I will take leave. Leave, huh? You don’t feel like going to office today? You are so funny. I have to go to the hostel. -Oh. Can I drop you? It’s okay. I will take a cab. Oh! I wanted to drop you in my car. Let me drop you downstairs. -Okay. Sir, sir, sir… Bill, sir. They paid, no? No, sir. Any problem? You have my card, no? Take it. Sorry, sir. Your card is not here. State Bank… Silver Card… password is 1280. Use it. -No, sir. Your card is not here, sir. See, I have my credit card. I can pay the bill. How long have you been coming to this hotel? Yesterday was the first time. I have been coming here for six years. This girl is new. That’s why she is not able to place me. You… let me show something extraordinary. I want you to observe it. One minute. Okay? -Sir, sir, bill, sir! -One minute. Sir! Observe this painting. I will sort it out with the girl. Just two minutes. I beg you. Let me send her home and come back. How rude your friends were acting yesterday? Huh? They must have said it for fun. Why do you want to make me the scape goat? Please don’t humiliate me in front of her. What if I complain to the manager? -Huh? -Huh. Last Tuesday… What were you doing with the guest in room 502 after your shift? What were you busy with? Should I tell? He was drinking beers in the room but you don’t bill them? Is the hotel your dad’s? Huh? Huh? So. Where is my card? Yes, sir. Your card is here, sir. -Go pay the bill. These five-star people are lazy, crazy people. They don’t check the cards, you know. I told her silver card. -Yeah. Blind girl! By the way, what did you observe in this painting? Actually... I didn’t understand anything. That is the greatness of a painting. Let’s go. Hey, did you do it? Yes, I did it. -Yay, yay! How was the experience? It was superb. Oh, my! Was it so good? Extraordinary. -Huh? Not once. Three times back to back. It must be the first time for the girl too. -Yes. Tell us in detail, man! Nothing. I first removed the lid. -Why is he talking of lids? -He must be referring to her dress. Then I took out the ladle. Ladle? -Censor. What a bowling. Buddy. And then? I ate it all up. -Ate up? You have to cook rice again. There is nothing left. Hey, not about what you are eating now. We are asking about what you were supposed to eat last night. Hey, it’s wrong to behave like that with a girl who is drunk. Hey, you don’t need the girl to fall for you to do it. You just have to find a girl who passed out from drinking. You made so many promises? I, Krishna Das, solemnly promise that I will enjoy. What happened? Guys. I never had those intentions. I want her to be my life partner. How was it possible. -Hey, what… what are you saying? -Wait, darling. Not he… if they both hear you, you will have a… If you don’t pay the rent, even you will…ah. Sir, we will pay it in two days, sir. What’s with this ‘two days’ now? If you don’t pay the rent right now, you will stay here but your things will be out. -Wait. You want the rent, right? -Yes. It’s done. Check your phone. Hi, Mr Chandra Sekhar. How are you? How is your family? Congratulations! You have received 8000 rupees rent from your tenant, Aadi. I got it. Thank you. Enjoy. -Have fun! But… we don’t have money. How did you Googlepay him? Google Pay my foot! I sent him a normal message. Why would Google say, ‘Hi, Chandra Sekhar. How are you? How is the family?’ and then transfer money? -What if he finds out? -We will do something meanwhile. -How are you, uncle? -I am good. How is your health? They must have given you salary yesterday. Why do you want money now? It's a costly story, uncle. You won’t understand. How much? -Ten thousand. -Interest? Same. Regular. Okay. I will transfer, go. Good morning, madam. Good morning. -Hey. Why are you meddling with her now? Hey, I want to go out with Keerthi this afternoon. If she finds me here occasionally, she will think I stay in the hotel. What about your clothes? -I will change. Why are you scratching your beard again? What happened? You need a car now, right? We already have a plan. Oh. -But will you manage the car owner? -Hey, that’s easy. I will take care of that. but make sure you tell her the truth today. We are waiters. Let us remain waiters. Don’t give her unnecessary hopes and deceive her What is this useless meeting about? -Sorry, madam. -Sorry, madam. Aadi, you are supposed to be in the valet parking. What are you doing here? You are supposed to be in Bollywood. What are you doing here? Have I ever asked you that, madam? Okay, okay. Get to work. Okay. Find someone for yourself. -Hello. -Hey, Keerthi is here. Hi. Namaste, sir. Keys… Why did you suddenly want to travel with me? Actually, you saved from Ajay yesterday. I was with you the whole night and I was unconscious. Yet, you didn’t touch even my finger. Many people are men only in their birth certificates. What is this? Very few are men by birth. Who are those? It’s you. That’s why I told you yesterday that I want to travel with you. Hey, macho man! Tell her we have nothing. -I must tell you something. -Sorry, I forgot your name. You don’t even remember my name? Uh… we had at least ten shots yesterday. Name? Guess. Praveen. Suresh. No. -Naveen. -No. Sanjay Rudra. Who is that? Why are you telling me a wrong name? What makes you so confident? You are Dr. Sanjay Rudra, CEO, SR Pharma Life. Your visiting card is here. Visiting… Doctor? Beauty with brains? Why are you hiding it from me? You think I don’t know the service you do from your medical industry? People call for a press meet these days without doing anything. But you do so much and yet how simple you are! Stop flirting with her and tell her the truth now. Hey, I am going to tell her. Wait. She has put me in a spot. Let’s go shopping. Excuse me. Excuse me. Why is he laughing? Is he mad? He looks crazy. Waiter! Menu. Tell me, sir? Uh, it’s… -Hey. Your face looks special. Okay. Get me the menu. Don’t angry. Have fun. Hey! You are really great. I am sure it’s your parents who are responsible for your personality. Please, please. I want to meet your parents. Please. Take me to your home. -Home? if we go home all of a sudden… My mom will be upset. You sound like a college student. You are the CEO of a company. Oh, yeah. Girls coming home and parties… it must be usual. I mean… all of a sudden… If you don’t want to take me, it’s okay. I have taken some lenience. Sorry. It’s not like that. I… I didn’t mean… I am not feeling bad. It’s okay. Oh, no! Hello I have been looking the whole afternoon. Where is Krishna Das? He is not in the hotel, is he? He served juice in 602 and went to 402 to serve biryani, Shrav… Sorry, madam. Important call from the company. I have to answer this. Yeah, okay. Carry on. Oh God! Hey, what is it? Where the heck are you? How long, man? You are killing us. Come fast. Hey, I have already spent ten thousand. She is pestering me to take her home. Do we have a home? There is a goddamned visiting card in the car. She thinks the house in police garden and the office in adyar are both mine. Now she wants me to take her home! Do one thing. Do you really need all this crap? Just leave her. Guys, we always thought of having a family. I want a family with her. I want all of us to be a family. Hey, let whatever happen. Take her home. Hey, how can he take her home? -Hey, where is the office did you say? -Adayar. -House? -Police garden. -Our hotel? -MRC Nagar. If this guy came to our hotel for lunch instead of his home in the same distance, it means there is no one at home. Hey, take the girl to the house. There will be no one at home. Tell her they all went shopping. Show her the house from outside. Problem solved! Waiter, menu! This is my regular spot. -Really? -Yeah. Wow. Thank you. -It's my pleasure. Thank you. Hey! Don't. Peace. Have fun. What do you mean have fun? That is my house. Wow. Hey, the gate is locked. I think everyone has gone shopping. Let us come some other time. Hey, this is your house! Honk! See? The gate is opening. You shouldn’t be so naïve. Let's go! Looks like the dog will bite me. Now I am excited. Wow! Such a huge house! Let's go inside. The door is closed. I think they went shopping. -Let us come tomorrow. Tomorrow. -Please, please, please. No, no. Oh no! Hey. Hey. hey. It’s open. They didn’t go shopping. It's not my house. Do you know how busy I am? I have... Such a big house? Huh? Such a big house? Huh? Where do you think I would live if not in such a big house? You have seen the house. Now, let’s go. Hey! Will you show me around the house? Please? Hey, what is there to show you? That is the kitchen, that's bedroom. There is a room upstairs and another room. When you go out, it’s my office. I am very busy. Let’s go. At least show me your bedroom, please. -Bedroom? -Hmm. I just met you yesterday and today you want to see my bedroom. And tomorrow honeymoon. When we talk such stuff... Feels like I am very slow. Where is she? Hey! Hey! Looks like she got in to the pool. Hey! Hey! Why did you get into the pool? -Come, come. It’s really good. I'm getting late for the office. Come. Let’s go. Careful. Give me your hand. Oh, it’s not deep. -Is this house on sale? -Is no one at home? I don’t understand. Probably there is no one at home. I guess they all went shopping. Hey, hey, hey! Who is it? Who is the girl? Get out! -Who is that shouting? Watchman? -I said leave. Not a watchman. My dad. He and I have had lots of issues. Come. Hey, wait. Stop. Who is that girl? Why did you get into the pool? Who the hell are you? I know. I didn’t come home for a week, and you ask me ‘who are you?’ After some time, you will probably say I am not your son. -Uncle, please bless me. -Hey, wait, wait. stop falling on his feet. -What is all this? Oh, no! Let's go! Come on! Let's go. Hey! Who are you? Hey, watchman! -Aunty, Namaste. Hey, I told you to stay quiet and you keep saying something. Hey, show me your face. I have lost all my rights to show you my face. I don’t even want a towel from this house. Take it. Let's go! -Sanjay! That was really close. Visiting card almost got me killed. I understand you are afraid of your parents. Why are you afraid of the maid? Actually... you know my mom is paralyzed. My dad was running after money and touring countries. My nanny used to take care of me and my mom. We consider those who give us food as mothers. Those who give food to our mothers… we call them nannies. Forget all this. Do you know what Krishna said about mother in Bhagavadgita? Nothing. See? Even Lord Krishna couldn’t say anything about mother. That is the greatness of a mother. But we were talking about nanny. When he had nothing to say about a mother, what could he say about a nanny? Try to understand. How did you become so great? You can praise me later. I got a hundred crore project in the office. Please. Can you take a cab home? Please? -Now? -Hmm. Why? Shouldn’t I be with you? Huh? Uff! Even your hand will not make this work. Please! Take a cab home. Sorry. I'm very busy. I'll see you soon. Bye. Hey, the manager was asking about you. I told her you went to 402 to serve juice. How long should I manage? What is this, sir? Move the car. Hey! You! Great timing. Hello, you! Move the car! Get the car out of the way! Hey, please, man. I am going on an urgent job. Let us fight later. It was wrong to slap you in front of a girl. I apologize. Okay? Please Hey, get the cars out of the way, man. I must return the car. Please, man. Break his bones, cut them into pieces and… They are not allowing you to complete the dialogue, brother. Ask them to stop the music! Hey, how do I move the car? Break his bones and cut them into pieces and feed them to the goats. Wow! What a shot! Is this how you mean? Bloody-- You want to deliver dialogues? Look at your horrible faces! Brother, he is abusing us without uttering a single bad word. Shut up! Go and hit him first. Hey, decide fast. I don't have time. We are also getting late for the wedding. If you finish your spicy fight, they can get married. Hey, you can keep fighting. We'll play our music. Make it fast. Come on. Play! Go! Two minutes. Clear the road. I said clear the road bloody- Wow! He wore in style. The coat. I gave you my girl. Why wouldn’t I clear the road for you? Give me the keys. Excuse me, sir. Special Don’t trouble your customer. Give it. Have fun! Keep it. I will walk like him from tomorrow. You are back! Come, come, come. Come fast! We are on the brink of losing jobs here. Give me the key first. Go! I hope you have enjoyed the food, sir. I'll punch you. He said something. Good afternoon, ma’am. I didn’t see you the whole afternoon. Did you go out? I should ask you that. Tell me honestly. Where were you? Madam, I served biryani in 402 and juice in 302. How come I didn’t see you? They must have finished it by the time you went. Not food. You! I didn’t see you! Madam, what do you tell us every morning? ‘Work like a spark. ‘ How can you see spark, madam? -It’s not that, Das. -Madam... you asked us to discuss nonsense only after six. Let me do my job, ma’am. Hello! There is an order from 302. At least, take care of that. Okay, madam. There are so many people like Nagesh, Naga Mani! Why you alone are so lazy? There are so many in the industry like Pooja Hegde and Rashmika. Why you alone are so crazy? Did we ask you that, madam? -Aadi… Valet parking. Hmm? -Oh. Enjoy your soup, sir. Damn it, man! We rather play a beggar. Never a rich man, bro. Have fun! Enjoying the life, huh? Shut up. I need to tell you something. We must pay the rent tomorrow. Owner knows about it. Don’t discuss problems for a while. I beg you. I am wetting my pants whenever Keerthi calls me. Keerthi calling. Have fun! Enjoying the life, huh? -I will jump. I want to die. -Hey, don’t jump, huh? Have fun. Hello. Hey, you are not the CEO of SR Pharma Company, right? Enjoying the life, huh? Who told you? When I asked in the reception they told me. Why did you go to the office now? I thought you were telling the truth. I hoped the hundred crore project materialized. So, I came here to surprise you. But you gave me a shock. It’s not that, Keerthi. Hear me out, please. Don’t say anything. Come here right now! Sir, is this for scrap? For valet parking. What the heck! This doesn’t fetch a chocolate on sale and he needs a valet. He lifts both his shoulders! Is he Pushpa 3? -Hey, move, move, move! -What happened? -Hey, get onto the bike. Come on. -What’s wrong? Keerthi went to Sanjay’s Company. -What? Let's go. -Have fun! Bloody hell! Whose company is this? Why did I come? Where is she? Hi, Keerthi! What a sudden surprise! You want to enjoy with me, don’t you? -Stop. You have successfully cheated me, right? Cheat? What do you mean cheat? Why would I cheat you? Who told you? Your receptionist. Why are they romancing in the daytime? Those glasses seem to blind you. He is caught there. Do you trust me or someone else? Dad… I got the job, dad. Where is the great man, CEO, who gave you the job? Why, dad? To thank him. The great man who gave you the job is over there talking to a girl. He is the CEO. Stock market is going to crash. You can’t have such long discussions with me. I am very busy. Then, come. Prove it. Come. People from Paracetamol and Saridon are waiting in the conference room for my help. Hey, who are you? My son got a job in your Company, sir. We came to thank you. This job will give him a new life. Who gave you a job? It was me, right? I forgot. Happy? Study well and bring the Company a good name. Though not as big a CA as I am, become a good one, okay? Good luck. Get going. -Sir! -Huh? It’s not CA, sir. It’s CEO. I was testing you. This is the first day of your job, right? I was testing you. My man is safe. Uh, sorry. Today, I… That’s okay. You are not convinced yet. What should I do? Tell me. Nothing like that. It’s okay. But... I wanted to ask you just one question? Ask me. You... That night... Why did you ask me that night if I had a girl friend? Oh, that! I am fashion student, right? I wanted to make her a designer dress. -Huh? -Hmm. -Did you really ask only for that? -Hmm. Yes. I do. I have a girlfriend. Do you remember what happened that day in the elevator? Huh? That day in the elevator? What elevator? I mean we were too drunk. And... I was all over you? Of course. Yeah, baby. -Hey, you said we will drink tonight? What can I say about last night? Tell me. About tonight. I still have body pains, you know? He handed over his body to someone. -Shut up. I hope he won’t at least eat the curd rice. Hey, everybody is watching, baby. Okay. Hey, how much this guy loves us! Love you, man! No! Come to the room. Come over. Let’s have two rounds. -That includes me? -Stop it. -You are that? -What? Is that why you never touched me that day? Hey, not like that. Not like that. -Oh no! I thought you were a great batsman. Now the pitch is empty. You got it all wrong. I'm a very good batsman! I hit only sixes. Are you flirting with me? Mm…hmm. Do you like me? Just a kiss? There is time to go to the second stage.

Go, go! Fast, fast, fast! Careful! Coffee. Open the lid. Yes! Yes. You said we can go to the second stage if I overtake? Shall I stop at the medical shop? Get out! Get out of my car! Hello! This is my car. Every day I tell you how to behave. Today let’s talk about how not to behave. See. She found out. I keep screaming my head off that one mistake and you will be out. Is this a five-star hotel or local lodge? Oh, yeah. Please, come, ma’am. Please. I am the manager of this hotel. I need to clarify few things. What happened? How do you know him? Here. In this hotel. You mean… did he serve you food? Why would he serve me food? Sorry, madam. He has been working as a waiter here for six years. Projecting himself as the SR Pharma life CEO, he has successfully cheated you. Using the rooms and cars of guests who give us business, they are trapping girls who visit here. I'll fire these three right now. Madam. As long as I am in the hotel sector, not only this hotel… I will make sure they don’t get jobs in any other hotel. And guys! Disperse! If you have successfully cheated a person, it doesn’t make the person a fool. It means they trusted you more than you deserve. When I learned about you now, I was scared how I would live my life. But I am not afraid now. Because I am getting rid of the guy who wanted to cheat me. You have lost a girl who wants to be in love with you. I wanted to give you this gift today and tell you how much I love you. You were also waiting to hear, right? I tell you this now. Listen. Sir, let us to stay for a week, sir. Please, sir. You can stay but the luggage will go. -It’s not that, sir. -What is not? What is not? I know people who lied to me that they paid the rent. But you are the only ones who made a fool of me. You send me a message of ‘rent paid’ on top of that! Hmm… Who are you? What is the rent? Are you going to live here or pay the rent? -How much is it? -Eight thousand. -Jeevan! -Sir? Give him advance for two years. -Okay, sir. Two years? Come with me. -What's going on? -Who is he? Hey, Krishna! -Who are you, sir? Why did you pay our rent, sir? -Come with me. -Where are you taking him? We almost got dragged to the streets but you saved us. Sir, why did you do all this? Who are you, sir? I will tell you. Start the car. Car? Krishna Das! Hmm! Open it. Did I get caught? Drive. -This house? -Yes. Krishna Das! Come. Come on! Sanjay… Is my elder brother’s son. A great thought he planted six years ago… has grown into a ten thousand crore Company today. Today we are discussing the most dangerous disease which is taking away millions of lives across the world. And you all know about it. It’s cancer. She is Stella. She has been suffering from cancer for two years now. World’s best doctors, Dr Rao and Dr Peter, treated Stella and certified that she won’t survive for more than four months. These are the reports. Dr Peter, what do you think Stella’s health condition will right now be? She might be dead by now. Dr Rao? Yeah, he is right. She might be dead. See… you all know SR Pharma Life has been trying to cure cancer for a long time. Phase 1…we have failed and then we passed. Phase 2… we failed and failed and then we passed. Phase 3….we failed, failed, failed and we finally passed and Stella is alive today. Yes! Let me introduce you to the inventor of this miracle drug. Dr. Sanjay Rudra along with Stella! It’s been my childhood dream to see a world free of cancer. Because that’s my dad’s dream. I was determined to make his dream come true and so I associated myself with the professor who partnered with my dad and took the research ahead. And in the past 7 to 8 years, we have failed many times but never gave up. And finally we have passed Phase 3 trials and you can see the live example. And gentlemen! This drug can cure blood cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer… every existing cancer in this world. Let’s hope for the cancer free world. He is Mr Dhananjay. Hello. He is ready to invest ten thousand crores in our project. No restrictions. We still hold the patent rights. Come on! Join the hands! We'll work together. All the best. Definitely, sir. But before we could complete the remaining research, he died in an accident. That too one week before his wedding. Neither the family nor the Company knows about his death. If the investors come to know this, the Company will collapse overnight. The family will be on the kerb. That’s why just for ten days… you must take his place and carry out his responsibilities. If you do it, you will be saving this Company and his family. Please don’t refuse, Krishna Das. I will give you the money you quote, Krishna Das. He is highly educated and a doctor. Research lab… I am just a waiter, sir. Do you really think I will fit the role, sir? Why do you worry? I will take care of everything. You mean? I said I will pay you whatever you want. So, this huge house… It is all yours. -Sir, such a huge house… -I told you it’s yours! -I am just asking for clarity, sir. -How many times should I tell you? What’s wrong? I lost my job. My girl dumped me. I thought we lost the house and we are on the streets… But you came like God and I must bow to you, sir. Sir! I don’t know who he is. I have no idea of your dreams or goals. But I will do whatever you say, sir. Hey, clothes are here. You can dress up here. Come on. Let me introduce the family. Don’t think too much. Let’s drink the mostly costly. -Feeling rich, bro! -Cheers, bro! -Bah! Others’ money always tastes better. -You are right, bro. Come on. -Brother… -Hmm? Sanjay is here. Hi. I don’t want to speak to him. -It’s not that. -He doesn’t want to speak. Let’s go. Hey, Sanjay! Let me talk. He should tell me directly if he doesn’t want to marry. How can he disappear one week before the wedding? Did he even think how hurt the girl must be! Do you say any regret in his face or in his heart? He feels ashamed. I have done so much, earned so much, saved so much. Drat! Why should I starve for this guy for four days? Nanny! I am hungry. Get me something to eat. -It’s my order. -Sir, order? Starter, soup or would you like main course directly? Why is he talking like a waiter in a hotel? You look too grim. He is trying to make you laugh. Hasn’t he forgotten his past? He still has the original in him. If it comes out, we will be in a mess. Yes, uncle. There! He is calling his dad ‘uncle’! Too many jokes! After all, it’s our Sanjay. Probably that’s why he took the wedding also as a joke and went away. Yes, yes. Hey! I don’t want to speak to him. Take him away. It’s not that. He is trying to tell you something. I said take him away. It’s not that. Listen to what I am… -Sanjay… Sanjay! I am talking to your dad. Stay quiet. Sorry, uncle. Actually… he is too naughty. So, the comedy is a bit high. Bah, what happened? What do you mean? Did you see his nose and his face? A dad should be like a dad from ‘Daddy’ film. But he looks like a mummy from ‘Mummy’ film. Confirmed, man. Sanjay must have died because of his dad’s face. I lost all the interest in performance after I saw his face. We owe the hotel 30,000 rupees. Do you remember? -Financial problems! -Think about it. The manager won’t let us get jobs. Think about our debts! -Stop it. Why should you be so poor in such a big house? -Sanjay! -Thirty thousand is important for us, bro. -Okay. -Sanjay! Do you hear me? Coming. Hey, decency! Coming. He should behave like Sanjay right? Why is he behaving like a cheapo? What are you whispering to them? I owe the hotel 30,000 rupees. If you are kind enough… You have seen how big the house is. -I will give you as soon as we go out. -Okay. -Sir! -Huh? Do you want this Sanjay’s character to be soft or harsh? I want it to be unsuspicious. -Okay? -Okay. -Here, they are… -Let me! Maternal aunt and uncle! We are paternal. Why is he calling us maternal? I didn’t mean for me. I was telling my friends what you are to them. Yes, uncle. He meant for his friends. -Nice cover up. -Why don’t you put 30k in an envelope? -I said I will give you after we go out. -Aunty! -Hmm. Uncle. -Hmm? Aunty… Uncle… Where to? They are performing like drama artists. Where is the scope for me to perform? Speak to them. Brother-in-law! Why did you do this? What have I done, sir? You are doing everything. Sanjay, what did you gain out of this? Uncle said I will gain quite a lot. She was not talking about the payment. Why did you flee from the wedding? Oh! What happened was… -Nephew... I have no patience to hear whatever you are going to say. I have nothing much to share either. I can only manage. He wants to tell you something. Why don’t you hear? Where did you disappear? A Pakistani girl was about to enter India at the border by mistake. personally took her and dropped her there. My nephew is gold. -Keep quiet. He summarized Bhajarangi Bhaijan. Why is she applauding him? This looks like comedy to you. I am upset my daughter’s wedding has stopped. She wants to have another daughter in the meantime. My health doesn’t co-operate. Is anyone concerned about my situation? Asking me so many questions at one shot, did you think about my situation? I am sulking. I am pouting. -Pouting! As if he is Samantha! -Hey, Sanjay… Sanjay. This is a new character. No one is being grateful. Very rude. Why does he say new character? Is he drunk? Medicine… its delivery… all the tension… You should understand. Bloody! No one wants to spare rhyming. How did Sanjay survive this family? Woah! Woah! What is this, brother-in-law? You hugged me in the hall the other day. Did I complain? You kissed me in the kitchen. Did I complain? Huh? Oh, they are still at the kissing stage. Looks like Sanjay is weak in these matters. What are you thinking? Marry me, brother-in-law. I will give you coffee every morning. And a kiss when you go to the office. I will cook by the time you return. I beg you. Why don’t you stop your flow? I am getting confused. -Sanjay. -Sir! Hey! Brother-in-law, the first time you hugged me, I almost fell for you. I already fell for someone who is much superior to you. -Sanjay! -Uncle, coming. Come. Madam Janakamma. Sanjay’s mother. She fell off the second floor by accident and was paralyzed. Sir… I look like Sanjay, right? So, maybe my mother might have looked like Sanjay’s mother? Could be. Mother… She can only hear. She can’t speak. She can’t react. Mother, I didn’t come to your house to deceive you. I may not be as great as your son. But I will not damage his image. I am telling you this because From now on... you are my mother. Office time. Sir… -Yeah. Thanks. Why? Let’s go to the office. Hey! Enough of your emotions. Settle the money matter. Okay? Ask him in the car. Will you? I will ask. -Be firm. Bah! This Dhananjay is a menace. Torture! Sir! -Huh? -We have come out. I know. We are going to the office, right? I will introduce everyone to you. -Sir… -Huh? You promised me something after we come out. How much will it be? Will it be some five lakhs? Hey, hey, hey! Just 39,000 rupees. -39000? -That’s all. I told you I will give you. -Yes. Can I make a commitment, sir? We have to stand on our word, sir. That’s all. Cool, cool. I will give by evening. I will throw the money at you. Hey, he will give it. Do you think they are shameless like us? They are a very decent family. Sir, you said you'll give it in the evening. In the morning you spoke of office. Are you giving it in the office or in the evening? Just a bit of confusion. My mind- Driver, stop the car! -Sir, sir, sir! -Stop the car, man! -Sir, sir! Two days is also fine, sir. It’s okay, sir. Promise. Evening is also fine. Why is his mood off over thirty thousand? -Sir… -Brother… Brother. Sir, take two more days, sir. No problem. I will adjust. Sir, it’s okay, sir. Over there…. 2 O'clock on sunday midnight. My nephew Sanjay met with an accident. Oh! I am really sorry, sir. -Poor boy… He wanted to deliver the medicine personally to Dhananjay. and was driving to the Pharma lab. This place looks familiar. He was self-driving alone in all the tension, and some roguish passer by threw coffee on his car. Krishna Das! Krishna Das. Krishna Das. Come! Let’s go. Jeevan! -Sir. Krishna Das looks disturbed. Explain everything to him carefully. This way, sir. Yeah. Hello! Sir! Your cabin is this way. -Morning, sir. -Morning, sir. Sir… Sir… I came to inform your death, but I can see you alive. Sir. Are you Mr Sanjay? Yes, I am Sanjay. But I saw your dead body in the mortuary an hour ago and here you are now! What are you doing here? You came so fast! Actually, one Krishna Das looks exactly like me. So, that guy has died. So, you say it was Krishna Das who died? Yes. If that’s the case, why is your ID proof in his wallet, sir? Both of us look alike, alright? So, I sometimes meet him in a coffee shop. Hey, wait, wait. You say Krishna Das and you look alike. You meet up at a coffee shop now and then. And your id cards were interchanged by mistake. Right? Sir, let us do this. If ever you must close your Company, consider becoming a writer. You will have great future. You are cooking up stories on the spot! Extraordinary, sir. Sir, it’s not at all what you think, sir. Hear me out, sir. Hey, Krishna Das, I see through your plan. You and Sanjay look identical. If you eliminate Sanjay, you can become the CEO. So, you removed Sanjay out of your way and now you are sitting in the CEO’s chair. Am I right? Sir, it’s not at all what you think, sir. Please listen to me, sir. Hey, I leave with only information now. But I will be back with proofs next time. Then you will have to come with me. But there will be no guarantee that you will go back, kid! Huh. See you soon. Hi. I asked your friends about you. They said you were here. What is this new look? New hair color, lens… Nice. Suits you. Actually... when I realized you were not the CEO, I spoke too much and left. At the end of it, wasn’t I commercial as well? When I was with you, I never thought about how I was, but only about what you had. Hello! -Huh? That’s why... I came to apologize. But when I came here, you seem to be really a CEO! -I am not a CEO. I don’t know what to do. I’ll tell them. I’ll tell his family. -Krishna. I’ll inform the cops as well. -Krishna! -Huh? Nothing will happen. I will tell them. -Krishna! I will inform his family. I will tell everyone in his family. -Krishna, it’s okay! -I will tell everyone the truth. Hey! I love you! Huh? We'll face this. Keerthi, I am only a waiter. Are you still okay with me? I am with you. Krishna, you have had enough drinks. Hey, that was an accident. You didn’t do it deliberately. Why do you feel as if you did it intentionally? Krishna… Hey… -Hey! I didn’t kill Sanjay intentionally. While driving on the road. It was an accident. I didn’t kill Sanjay on purpose. You are the first person I should apologize to. I am not apologizing to you because you are the first person to forgive me. I am not even able to look into your eyes. I made a very grave mistake. I feel like killing myself. I'm the reason Sanjay is dead. But... to keep Sanjay’s ideals alive, I must live for a few more days. After I complete every task that Sanjay aspired to do, after I complete it… the next minute… I will die. Krishna! Hey. Give me a chance to live until then, please. -Calm down, Krishna. You didn't do this on purpose. For the situation, we are in, we need money. But look at this guy! -Uncle… -Krishna Das, where are you? Uncle, what happened? Dhananjay is coming to the office. What’s the matter, uncle? He wants all the properties and liabilities of the Company to his name. We lost Sanjay in the accident and so we couldn’t deliver the medicines in time. Dhananjay also has the support of the real estate mafia. Hey. it is Sanjay’s dream for ten years to make the SR Pharma Life Company stand. This shouldn’t stop under any circumstances. I hope Dhananjay will give us at least a week’s time. But he is a moron. He is not the kind to listen to anyone. Hey! Uncle, uncle! What happened? Moron speaking, Sanjay. Dhanunjay, Dhanunjay, give me a week’s time. Take your own time, kid. -Let go off me. I will take care of your Company till you come. Dhanunjay! Dhanunjay! Listen to me! Dhanunjay! This Company is my ten year long dream. If you create a ruckus, my reputation and the Company’s will be ruined. -All my employees are standing and -Let them go! Let the employees go home. How much will this Company value anyway? Two thousand crores? You owe me ten thousand crores. So, 8000 crores minus. Anyway, you promise to deliver the medicine in a week. If we pull out a limb each day in the mean time, I am sure your uncle’s head will be spared. What do you say? -It’s not that Dhanunjay. -Dear… at the back… at the back. Hey, Dhanunjay! Dhanunjay! No! Dhannunjay! Why make an issue, sir? I am from a very decent family, sir. This violence and all… It scares me, sir. Please give me a week’s time, sir. Please, sir. Sir, why do you want to take the blame for making a doctor violent? All it takes is a week. Be kind, sir. You are beating them black and blue and what doctor? Are you behaving like a doctor? Are you a doctor in the first place? You are insulting me! If not a doctor, a waiter? Only a doctor knows where to fold and hit to break a bone. Don’t doubt my profession, sir. Please. Mr Dhanunjay! Even after all this thrashing, if you don’t give me a week’s time, Next, it will be your turn. You will hit me? Why will you hit me? If you have hit ten goons, you will become a 11th goon. You have to delivered my medicine in a week. That is what I have been harping on since I stepped in, Hey, get the papers. Sign them. Sanjay, Sanjay! Don’t. He is doing this only to provoke you. Don’t sign. Please. Uncle, for the first time I feel like a son in your family and Sanjay for this Company. Don’t stop me. I want to be Sanjay. Papers. Sanjay if the medicines are not delivered before the agreement expires, -Not just you…even your family- -Hey! We have sorted it out, right? It is all done, right? ‘I will harm your family… I will attack your home, I will see your end.’ Don’t tell me such boring dialogues. But if you do mess with my family, I'll finish you. Let's go, uncle. Who knows whom fate brings together? Linked to the heart is my first journey as a person Is this a beginning that doesn’t know the end? Is this a question that has no answer? Is it a boon I have never asked for? A truth which is my truth? I wonder what story God has written? Whom has He assigned to meet? What turn He might have planned at every step? This is a second life And I have discovered love There is no smile on the lips Though it is taken for hypocrisy As a mother unknown stands before me my heart melts into tears Who knows whom fate brings together? Linked to the heart is my first journey as a person They still think Sanjay is alive. They still think I am Sanjay. I can’t even look at them in the eye. I want to tell them the truth, Keerthi. What if they don’t accept you? You didn’t accept me at first either. We are still together, aren’t we? I'm scared. Alright, tell them. Whatever will happen will happen. I am with you. Uncle! Uncle! Looks like the house is empty. Uncle! Hello, uncle! Krishna Das, where are you? Uncle, I have come home. I want to talk to you about something. Tell me. What is it about? I want to tell everyone the truth, uncle. Hey! What? No, no! Listen to me. Don’t do that. I am not able to deceive them that a dead man is alive. This is too bad a cheating. I feel it’s very wrong. I feel like telling them the truth. Hey, you are definitely not cheating, Krishna Das. Listen to me. It’s not cheating at all, Krishna Das. What else do you call this? I am not even able to look them in the eye. -It is not cheating. -Please, listen to me, uncle. -Krishna Das… -Uncle, I am so sorry. Please… I want to tell them. -I did cheat them. I am really… -What you did was no cheating at all! Because Sanjay Rudra is still alive. Sanjay. What do you mean Sanjay is alive, sir? Didn’t you say you did all this for the professor? Professor? When his father passed, Sanjay had already finished his Medicine in Panaji. So, he became an associate of the Professor in cancer research. When Phase-1, Phase-2 and Phase-3 trials were successful, we conducted a seminar to introduce the tablet to the market. Sanjay, Come on. Let’s go. Professor, I am going to the seminar. You are not. Your job is done. But I invented the cancer formula pill. How can you attend it, huh? Ridiculous. What’s all this, huh? I get it. You are still the old stubborn fool from Panaji Medical College. When you joined the lab after your dad’s death, I thought you wanted to fulfill your dad’s ambition. But I was wrong! Professor! Professor! Can I call you pro? Pro. You guys don’t match my wavelength. You haven’t evolved mentally yet. Giving birth is one thing. Being a father is another thing. I was happily inventing my beautiful piece of pharma drug. But that caused a few deaths and the experiment failed. When I was worried sick about money my dad died. Do you know what I realized when my dad died? You and my dad were inventing a cure for cancer. This cancer pill… Hey! developing this cancer formula is a 20 year long dream for me and your dad. Finally, we have a cure for cancer. -Congrats! Congrats to you! You made a cure for cancer! But… I need a cure for everything, that’s money! You don’t have the mental capacity to keep your mind open. I don’t have the time to explain my theory to you. Leave me your buggers! Hey! The only live example Sanjay had to launch the cancer pill in the market was Stella. As the seminar was a success, Dhananjay invested ten thousand crores. When Sanjay was on cloud nine… Sanjay! -Yeah. The medicine we experimented on Stella, didn’t work on another girl, Sanjay. The bad luck is, she is dead. Cancer pill is not working, Sanjay. Congrats. Congrats to you! The pill doesn’t work on everyone, fool! Professor! The kid is dead, professor. Huh? Professor! The girl is dead, professor! I am feeling so heavy, Professor. I think this is called guilt. Yeah, this is guilt. Professor, the pill… the formula and the ten thousand crores… take it all, Professor. Because you are the doer, the result, and the action. You are my master, professor. Please, take it, Professor. But please Share the formula with me, Professor. Please, Professor. -Hey, drama queen! I am not your father. Even if you kill me. I won’t tell you the formula. I tested it on people of a particular blood group. And it worked. But before I could develop a pill that works universally, I can see your cunning nature. You are worse than any cancer. I am worse than cancer. But you can cure me, Professor. You can do it. Give me the formula, Professor. I'll never tell you the formula. I will not! Doctor! Yes, Sanjay. Other than those present in this room, have you informed anyone that this formula is not working? No, Sanjay. No one knows except me. You didn’t tell anyone, right? Try to remember. No, Sanjay. I haven’t told anyone. I went through the Professor’s files to check why it is not working. Then I understood, Sanjay. The combination in the pill was effective on Stella but not on my trial patient. I checked the Professor’s thesis and… Doctor! Try recollecting. Are you sure you haven’t told anyone other than these? Think again. Trust me, Sanjay. I didn’t. You are so honest, doctor. Microbiology, Pharmaceutics, Drug design… I have excelled in them. I have worked under the best scientists in the Pharma industry. I will do it myself. Sanjay started doing his own research. But everyone who took the drug was dying. -People are dying, Sanjay! Innocent people are dying! You can't do it. You can't do it. People are dying. Sanjay understood no combinations were making the cancer pill work. Change your attitude. I have my plan. Pro. Professor! You know, you are most inhuman. People are dying because of you. Not even the slightest guilt… Why should I be guilty when you are not? So, doesn’t it matter to you who dies? No problem. I don’t care. You mean anyone? I don’t care who dies, okay? I will not tell you even if you kill me. hey, Sanjay! Gita! She is my daughter. You bloody sadist! Shh…. One… two…three… Get up! Get up! Get up. Hey! You bloody! Cheat! Traitor! Sanjay… Sanjay… you are a gentleman. You are like my son. Please don’t harm her. See what a nice person I am! Your daughter… your daughter is alive! I am a good man, right? I didn’t hurt your daughter. Tell me the formula. -Daddy! Don’t tell him, daddy. Tell me the formula and I won’t touch your daughter. Otherwise… Shut up! If you don’t tell me the formula. No, don’t hurt her. I am going to kill your daughter. -Daddy, don’t reveal the formula, dad. -He says he will kill you. Tell me. Shut up! Hey, Sanjay! -Shut up! Don’t hurt her! Shut up! Laugh, Professor. Professor. Professor. Laugh now. Laugh! Laugh! Laugh, Professor. Laugh, Professor. Laugh. Professor… Hey, hey, hey! Get up! Ten thousand crores! Give me the formula. Ten thousand crores! Professor, get up! Get up, man! Get up, get up. Get up! Get up! Sanjay. Sanjay. Sanjay! Sanjay! Hey! Hey! What the heck are you doing? I am waking him up, uncle. He is already dead! You have lost it. You have lost your mind. And the ten thousand crores. Sanjay! Dolly. Dolly. Sanjay couldn’t face even his love, Dolly. Sanjay, please. I want to see you. Dolly. Open the door, Sanjay! Dolly! I am failed. Sanjay, it’s okay. This coward, Professor, committed suicide. What? It’s all gone now, Dolly. Sanjay, it’s okay. Please open the damn door! No! I don’t want to show you my face. Sorry. Since we didn’t supply the drug as per the date mentioned in the agreement, Dhanunjay was pressuring us for the medicine. We could not deliver the medicine. We were not ready to return the ten thousand crores either. When we were at our wit’s end as to how to escape with all the money, we found you like a boon at the hotel. You should be totally free. That’s why I got you fired by your manager. When you couldn’t pay the rent and were standing clueless on the road, I appeared like God and paid the rent. you followed me like a pup wagging your tail. Since you are an orphan, we connected you to the family first. You were emotional you have found a dad. Who do you think he is? Our servant. And…once you came home, I gave you a responsible job but you were so silly to ask me for 5000, 10,000 and 30,000 and proved you are cheap. And you are very sentimental about your mom. I was wondering how to exploit this sentiment and you came up with a scene of your own saying she looked like your mother, showered all the love and made my job easier. I thought it was the right time and linked you to Sanjay’s accident. Do you think you are Detective Sherlock Holmes? Why do you keep saying you killed Sanjay? Did you see him? Did you see Sanjay in that car? What nonsense are you talking? No, no, no. That’s when the interesting character entered. Anyone with a uniform becomes a cop? What? Just the uniform? -Namaste, sir. Namaste. Don’t you have minimum common sense? Each time you became skeptical, Sanjay was diverting you with some new character. We wanted to finish you in Dhanunjay’s office, get him arrested and get rid of him. But you thrashed all of them like a hero, saved all of us… and turned the whole plot upside down. Meanwhile, we got the visas. So we have to leave. This is called cheating, dear. You were deceived thinking something else was cheating. So, we are leaving to Spain. Hello, hello… an important thing. Once, you have realized what a fool you are, don't hold on to the phone for so long, dear. Yes, dear. Sanjay, the cops didn't arrest Krishna Das. He escaped. -How did he escape? Sanjay!. Miss? How the… how the heck! Congratulations. You are successfully a worthless piece of shit, right now. It’s not that, Sanjay… Shut up! I told you don’t send him on world tours but tie him up at home! ‘Let’s give him a twist. Let’s play a game.’ Didn’t I tell you to tie him up and dump him at home? Didn’t I? What did I say? Yeah. If we don’t get him, I will personally enjoy killing you all. Do you understand? Yeah. Go, get him. Yeah. -Hello, Aadi! -Tell me. Buddy. Hey! Sanjay is still alive. This is a big scam! What are you saying? They trapped me in a ten thousand crore scam, man! Cops are chasing me, bro. Cops? Ten thousand crore scam? I just don’t understand. Hey, hey, what performance each of them has put up! When I met that puny rogue who drank only cheap liquor I had my own doubts. How could he be Sanjay’s dad? What performance by each one! Who was that? My aunt! When she was welcoming me, I didn’t know she was being symbolic to kill me. Aunt, uncle, cousin, bloody, everyone was fake. And among them all…the highest paid artist… who was that? Uncle! Uncle! What acting skills! Sunday… midnight… 2 O’ clock… Sanjay died here. What a performance! I didn’t realize. Hey, cops are chasing me, man. -Hey, did you tell Keerthi about this? Keerthi! No, I didn’t tell Keerthi. Hey. Keerthi’s hostel is the safest place for you now. Go there. We are coming. Guys... they have totally messed me up. -Don't cry. How did this happen? Your life is full of miseries that even misery is ashamed of. You had to land in the fake family of all. -Not fake family. It's a Parasite family. -Ask Keerthi to come down. Keerthi, Keerthi, Keerthi! Keerthi! Listen to me carefully. Listen to me carefully. -Okay. Sanjay is still alive. This is ten thousand crore scam. They made me a pawn in this scam. And now… the cops are after me, Keerthi. What! But where are you right now? I am near your hostel. Come down. They say all this started when they saw me at the hotel. Hotel? What! Did they say that? Yes. But it was me who saw you at the mall and sent Sanjay your picture. Huh!? Hello, Dolly. If I tell you what I just saw, you won’t believe me. -What? -Yes. Check your whatsapp now. Uncle, how can you take credit? Sorry. Overtake him. -Sanjay… -Yes, Dolly. He has started. It’s time. To call the cops. But I didn’t do all this out of anger for you. I did it out of my love for Sanjay. See you. And once you realize you have been fooled, Don't talk to them for so long. Let’s go. Sanjay… Tell me. We missed him again. Can’t you be on call for like five minutes? -Did you have to call him and tell him? -Why are you screaming at me? Why are shouting at her, son? Do I have to tell you again? -Selfish! -Let’s go, dear. This has become a circus! Hey, normally the cat is considered a bad omen. But you seem to be a bad omen for the cat. Oh, my! What an act she had put up! A girl who comes to city and lives alone… Do you know how much struggle and how much pain she faces? Pain, my foot! Hey, when six players play against six, it’s called volleyball. When six play against one person, it's an handicapped game. Guys... I just don’t understand. The cops are after me. They ask for ten thousand crores! Hey, it’s not important now to prove you are not concerned with the 10,000 crores. You must first prove you are not Sanjay. We’ll check what he and his family are up to. You stay right here. Let’s go. Sanjay… Catch them. Catch the two idiots. They are our source right now! -Uncle! -Huh? Go home and ask them to send ten crores…no! Huh? 20 crore cash…No! Arrange for a hundred crore cash. Hey, hey, Sanjay! What are you saying? We either lose a hundred or gain ten thousand crores. And you have no dialogue here… because my life will be ruined. Go send the cash. Hmm. Bags! Bags! Come on. Here, brother-in-law. -Take it. Okay, sir. -Careful. Yeah? -Okay, sir. Okay. What is this, brother? You dumped us in a remote resort. Where is Sanjay? Are we going to Spain or not? -We don’t understand anything. -Wait. Brother-in-law, is it really necessary to give him hundred crores? Pay 50k to our person. He would bring his men on bike and cut off his limbs. It’s better your limbs are cut off. You are never short of stupid advice. I guess brother-in-law is angry. Let’s down a peg. Hey, sentiments. You have stolen ten thousand crores. Change the brand. Why do you drink cheap liquor? Hey, keep quiet. All these days you didn’t even let me wear lungis. You put me into pants and made me drink Malt, Scotch and what not. Look. Don’t hurt the sentiments of a servant. This is my favourite brand And I will drink it to my fill. -So, you don’t want to drink? -I won’t. What is it, dear? Dad, you asked me to love Krishna Das. Who do I love now? I am not Prakash Raj from Santosh Subramaniam to still hold your hand. Catch whoever you want. Anyway, since your uncle has got ten thousand Crores he is not so stupid not to give you and me a thousand crores each. Look at the original characters gushing out. Why don’t we both have a peg? Bah! I have my own problems but this guy is only worried about liquor. Your mind is always on alcohol. How much have you earned? Nothing, sir. You earned nothing? If you made no money… Tomorrow... Suddenly... some truck rams into you while you walk alone on some road and you land in bed with life hanging in air, do you need money or not? Yes. Do you have money? -No, sir. Fine, there was no accident. What if some scoundrel more dangerous than the accident enters your life, and asks you to call your friend here or tell him where he is… if someone asks... Will he reveal? He won’t. But what he goes mad… And shoot? Sir! Sir! Why did you shoot him, sir? Sir, sir! Hey, Mahesh! Sir, please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir. Sir, sir, please, sir. He is my friend, sir. Poor guy, sir. Sir, sir, sir. Please, sir. -Let’s take him to the hospital, sir. -Sir, sir, sir. Please, sir. -Let’s take him to the hospital, sir. Sir, he is going to die, sir. Sir! Let me take him to the hospital, Please, sir. You need money for it, don’t you? Sir. Hundred crores. Call Krishna Das and ask him to come here. Sir, Krishna Das is our friend, sir. Sir, sir! Don’t kill him, sir. I will call him, sir. I will call him up, sir. I will do it, sir. Tell me. Hey, Krishna, Sanjay is drunk and passed out here alone. I will share the location. Come quickly. We can hand him to the cops. -Is he alone? I am coming! -Okay, come. Aadi. Open the door, Aadi. Open the door, Aadi. Where is he? Hold on. Who is he? Aadi! You said Sanjay is completely drunk and out, Aadi! Alright... Move. Hey, loser! Not the gun. We need him alive. Wow! What a wow! How did I ignore this logic? Mahesh! Who hurt you? Hey, Sanjay! Krishna Das! Gun? A gun? Are you going to kill me? Kill me. Come on, kill me. Oh! But if you kill me, who will go to jail? Will you? No, no, let me do this. Let me shoot myself. Das! No. Let me shoot myself. Please. No, no, no. See, see, see. Don't do it, Das. No? Let’s do this. Shall I shoot you? Shall I shoot you? Huh? Huh? Huh? Tell everyone to leave. Tell them to leave! All of you get out. Get out! You started all this, right? Come. Let’s finish this together. Hey, Krishna! Hey! Get up. Did you think you can come here alone... and beat me up? it’s ten thousand crores, man! Do you even know the number of zeroes in it? Footpath mongrel. There. Sanjay has come. Sanjay! What happened, Sanjay? Huh? What happened? Why don’t you answer? -What happened? -We did it. -Yes! -Yay! Go to Caribbean. You will be the first suspect. So, let’s not give any leads. I will see you in one week. Just one week, okay? Okay. Okay, bye. I'll see you. Uncle! -Huh? Whoo! Deliver this money to the Swiss bank in two days. We’ll do it. -Thank you. -We'll hand over.

Sanjay… Sanjay! Did you see Sanjay? -No. -Where did Sanjay go? -How would I know? Ah, Sanjay! Where are you? I don't know. Is it right to deceive Krishna Das? Sanjay! If we didn’t deceive him, our family would be on the road by now. Moron! So have I no family? Why did you try to ruin my life? What are you talking about, Sanjay? Drop your ‘What are you saying, Sanjay?’ And switch on the TV, you tube-light! Hello, hello… hello? Hello, hello, hello. -Hi! -Sit down. Sit down. Don’t tell me he got into Hollywood? Hey, he is not Sanjay. He is Krishna Das. We are doomed. He is not Sanjay? -Do you want this? -Hey, hey, hey! It’s ten thousand crores, man. Ten thousand crores, man! I was at home for a week and you didn’t realize I was not Sanjay? He fooled my brother-in-law. Are you wondering on how the story flipped? Ten thousand crores, man! Do you even know how many zeros in it? Footpath mongrel! This is what happens when you hire footpath people in the hotel. He definitely needs me. He wants a lead to catch me. You must become the lead. Go to his house and loiter there. Loiter until he catches you. Once he has you, he will either torture you or offer you money to get me there. Once I come there, I will put my engine in his house. His time has come. Footpath mongrel, huh? Footpath mongrel, huh? Why do you have to disrespect me? He takes some kind of drugs. Search him. Give it to him. We are middle class people. Our focus is only on how to live within the ten or twenty or thirty thousand we make. But we never think of cheating or robbing. But I wanted give you a taste of a middle-class man’s retaliation. Not because you deceived me. But you killed the professor’s dream of a cancer-free world. You killed him along with his daughter! That’s when I had decided to show you a middle class man’s warning. Dear, Janakamma is missing. Janakamma is missing? -Huh. Hey, what did you do to her? -Hold it, hold it, hold it Hey, What did you do to mother? Mother. Since my childhood, I grew up without a mother. When I first met you, I thought my mother probably looked like you. Though I cheated the others at home, I have always been honest with you. Take care, mother. Krishna Das, a mother never deceives. Mother! They are all the same. Believe me. When my husband died, I thought my son will reform himself. But when he replaced my husband’s photo with a servant’s… I wanted to kill him the same day. Krishna Das! I am... your mother. I cannot live with these animals. Take me with you. I took mom because I want her with me. I took the money because you don't deserve it. And you wanted to buy my friends with fifty crores each? They are like my mom and dad. Do you have enough money to buy my mom and dad? Don’t you find a character missing from this entire syllabus? Huh? What did you do to Dolly? Hello, Sanjay. -Yeah, baby. I can’t wait to see you. How long? I can understand. Just four more days now. Yeah, just four days. See you in Caribbean. I love you. I love you too. Enjoy everything when you can. It’s over, my friend. Remember. We only have the same face. Not brains. It takes just a little time. And all I have is time. This is not the end. Footpath mongrel! I kicked you like a football and landed you in jail just because you called me footpath. Say that again. And I will smash you right here. Hello. Yeah baby. It's honeymoon time. -Huh? Krishna Das has put us all in soup. -Brother-in-law! None of you move! You are under arrest. Hello! Don’t touch me. -It’s okay. Dear! Dear, what's happening hear. Dad. -Cocaine. -Oh, bloody! Smoothly turn your face. Let go! Let go! Leave me. I want to talk to my brother-in-law. What is it, brother-in-law? Are they holding you tight from behind? Mr Dhanunjay, the Chairman of D Trust, Sponsors 10,000 crores to cancer research. Hey. You are supposed to be in jail. What are you doing here? Whose money did you donate? Huh? Breaking news! Mr Dhananjay is announced as the Central Health Minister under the Cabinet quota. So far, Mr Dhanunjay, who is well known as a businessman will now get into public service as the Health Minister. Ministry in a single day? How? Don’t take to heart whatever I said earlier. Whatever help you need in future, just think of me. It’s a star hotel, man. It will cost 300 crores. I don't want for free. I have some money with me. -How much is it? Let's say…a hundred. -What about the remaining two hundred crores? -Are you behaving like a minister, Dhanu? Okay, okay. Madam, who is our new boss, madam? I have no idea. Stay silent. Sanjay. Aadhya. Anand. Anjali… Aakash… You are sure it’s going to be a boy? If not that, then Anandi. Why should you always have the last say? Huh? Let’s decide and then name the baby. We still have time. -What is there to decide? You have already given the luggage. -Hello, who is this? Hello, Doppelganger. -Hello. You don't know the meaning of doppelganger, right? Footpath mongrel! Hey. How did you get out? You are really bad at conversations, waiter. Scolopolamine. It’s a mind controlling drug. It steals free will. The way I took the trouble and made you dance to my tune like a puppet? Just like that. But now there is no need for an effort. The tablet I created in Panaji... Just give them a tablet, and they follow you like sheeps. Trees, fields, water, fire, wind… they belong to us. We are supposed to be out. But they imprisoned us forcefully. I am the king who came to release you. You are slaves who should obey only my command. If they stand in the way, whether it’s the prison walls, or the cops or a storm… we must march ahead tearing through them all. Let’s go. I am coming for you. Get ready. Sanjay… What do we do? This is the beginning of the end.
