Do you know as to what is the punishment.. ...for entering into a ladies compartment? - Yes, jail. This means that he has gone to jail previously too. No, this would be my first time, madam. Where are you going? - Du.. Du.. Dubai. This train does not go to Dubai. Be quiet, Gauri. - Please let me go. - Just a minute. We'll let you go on one condition. - Yes? You'll have to convert from a man to a lady. No, no, don't do this to me. - Or else I'll pull the chain. The TC, guard and police, all of them will be here. And the whole public too. - And then they'll beat you. Think of it. Do you want to become a girl or a prisoner? Or else take the beatings. All right girls; Let's close our eyes.

Oh god, these girls. Who knows.. ...how much dowry people demand for them? How much he troubled us. Hey, get away. I'm sorry, greetings. - What is it? They just come like that. What do you think about Bombay? What do you think? Every thing is in Bombay. You just come to Bombay. Some body packs all the trash and sends it to Bombay. But I'm not trash. - Yes I know, you've come.. ...from the village. Don't you have any work? - Yes I have work. - Good morning. How are you? How's life? What's wrong? Is he your friend? - Yes. - Take him. No, no, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid at all. Everything will be fine. It's ok. - Ticket. I know the officer. Oh no, no problem. No problem, sorry sir. Forget it man, don't feel bad of my friend. As the population keeps increasing in Bombay. But I haven't come to live in Bombay. - Yes. I'm going to Dubai. - Is that so? If at all there was a plane in my village then.. Oh I see, you're going to Dubai. - Yes. I'm just waiting for my friend. He didn't come to pick me up. Did he say he'd come? - Yes he knows that.. ...I'm coming to Bombay for the first time. Oh ho, ho, just a minute. Do you have his address? Yes I do have it. Just hold this. I'll give you the address. Oh, man, this lodge is just near my house. - Is it? - Yes. I was just going home. C'mon I'll drop you there. I would be very grateful sir. - Why should you say that? A human being should help another human being. Driver. - Do you have a car too? - Yes. What should I do? What a coincidence it is. I came to receive somebody.. ...and he hasn't come. You have come.. ...but nobody has come to receive you. Yes sir. - Keep the luggage of this gentleman, in the car. He has to go where we will be going. I have been thinking, had you not been there.. ...then what would have happened to me? Somebody would have taken away your luggage. - Is that so? - Yes. I'm going now. I'm, going to see the driver you stay here. I'm coming along with you. - No you stay here itself. It's possible that your friend comes here. Yes that's quite possible. And even if he doesn't come then we'll still reach you there. You're very kind. - Now you don't move from here. - No. You don't move from here. - No I will not move. Oh god, you have sent a good man to help me. Long lives hanuman. Don't worry young man. Whatever god does, he does it for the good. Maybe something good may come out of this. I'm sorry sir, are you an inspector or a saint? You're right, you're right. Take this sweet from the offering. My name is P.K. Sant. But I'm a Sant by eating. You don't worry at all. We'll definitely find your baggage. And if the lord wills, then you'll get it too. Go. - Yes? - Go. Long live India. Long live Hanuman. Long live India. Long live Hanuman. Greetings, greetings. Oh you killed me, you killed me. I'm sorry, forgive me. Forgive me. It's not your fault, foreigner.. ...this is the fault of this one leg. Don't say that, I'm feeling very ashamed. Ok, you can go now. I'll be lying here itself. - Forgive me. What do you want? - Is this Prem kutir lodge? - Yes it is. Have you booked any room? No, no. My name is Sunder Shrivastav. - Oh. I've come from Jawaharpur. - I see. - That Prem has.. Yes Prem, Prem. He has left a letter for you. Sunder, you may definitely be shocked to read this.. ...letter of mine. But believe me my friend this is my last letter. Actually I was in need of money to go to Dubai. I couldn't arrange for Rs. 10,000. So I thought of you. Just think that a friend has helped a friend. And yes Sunder, give the pen that I gave you, to this man. I hope that you'll surely forgive me. Isn't it? Did you get my pen? He told me that you're going to get it. Yes. Is this it? - Yes, thank god, I got my pen. Sir, this lodge, I mean who are the owners of this lodge? My father and myself. - What? Isn't it this fellow? What? - No, what I mean is can I get a place for the night? Yes, why not? But where is your baggage? That got stolen. - It got stolen. - Yes. Then you'll have to pay a deposit.. ...of Rs. 500, and a rent of Rs. 25. - Will do. Money, where's money. I had kept it safely. Inside, perhaps. I got it. I understood everything. You had come through this door itself, isn't it? - Yes. Now go out from this same door. But where will I sleep tonight? If you want to sleep for free then go to.. ...the cemetery. It's just opposite. Go on. - How can I go to the cemetery? Where will I sleep in the cemetery? The cemetery is a very scary place. Is the cemetery a place for sleeping? I'll sit here on this grave. How lucky are these people. They are sleeping so peacefully here. It's because you don't have any worries. What will you do now Sunder Shrivastav, what will you do now? With what face will you go back to the village? You have pawned the house and the field. It seems now that my dream of opening.. ...a school in the village will remain a dream. I'll never be able to fulfill my father's.. ...dream of educating the village people. I'll never be able to fulfill his dreams. How hurt will his soul be? What will I do? I cannot understand as to what I should do. I can't even think of anything. Sorry. - It's all right. My ears have started ringing because of the tension. Does anybody sleeping in a grave talk? No. So do you hear my voice? Who is it? Who.. Who is it? What are you looking here and there? I'm speaking from the same grave on which you were sitting. What.. What are you saying? Yes, I'm talking.. ...from this grave for the past 20 years. But nobody heard my voice. You are.. ...the person who will be useful to me. Why.. Why are you fooling with me mister? Tell me, who are you? - I'm a ghost my friend. Ghost? Oh Lord Hanuman, protect me! Oh my god! Hey don't run. I'll not hurt you. Hello. God had told me that only that person.. ...can help me, the one who can hear my voice. No.. No.. I - just listen to me. - Who is this? Get up.. ...get up you, bastard. - I'll get hurt sir. So you're from the CID. You've come.. To look for us is it? - He's come he's come. No, I'm not from the CID. - He's not he's not. Any person from the CID who.. ...comes here.. - Has been killed. No, no mister, I'm not from the CID. Yes he isn't from the CID. - Did you hear that? He's also saying the same thing. Actually I was running, as I was afraid of him. - Yes. Tell that to these people. Why are you.. ...people looking there? Look here, here. He's having a hat, why don't you tell them? Yes, he was running as he was afraid of me. - Did you hear that? Hey, you rogue. My name is Manglu. Put me down. Mister put me down. Did you see that? - Please put me down. How did he go up? Put me down sir, put me down. Come on. Forgive me Mr. Knife man look at him. Just see. Why are you beating him so much? Let him go. Don't beat him there. He'll get hurt. Are you ok, Mr. Knife man? You cap Mr. knifeman. I don't want the cap I want your life. You are unnecessarily getting angry. I'll finish you today. Finish. - Save me. - Shall I save you? He didn't die did he? You.. My bottle, my bottle. C'mon let's run away. - Where are you running mister, take your cap. Run away, run away. - At least take this. Where's he gone? C'mon I too will. - Hi, my name is Marco. Sunder Shrivastav - Shake my hand, shake my hand. From today, you and I will stay together for a few days. Look, as it is I'm in a great trouble. - Yes, yes I know it. You are alone in such a big city. You have a problem for staying. You have a problem for your food. You have a problem for sleeping. And as of now you have a problem for living too. Believe me Sunder, I, a dead man.. ...can solve your living problems. No, no, no. Let me go. Please forgive me. I cannot stay with you because I'm alive and you're.. Don't think of me as you would.. ...of other ghosts, I'm not like that. You chanted the prayers to dispel the.. ...ghost but I have appeared before you. Why was that? - Why? - Because I'm.. ...not like the other ghosts. A ghost is a ghost isn't it? I mean the characteristics. Please let me go. Salutations. You want to open a school in your village isn't it Sunder? You want to release your mortgaged house, and land isn't it? So you help me and I will help you. You'll be able to go back to your village. You can get everything. Land, house, dreams, everything. But I.. - Don't think, Sunder, don't think. There will not be any problems. I assure you. Look I have to attain enlightenment. If I play truant, then how will I get enlightenment? But I.. - Listen sit, here. I'll explain everything to you. From childhood I had wished to become wealthy. And when I grew up, I became obsessed with this wish. I wanted to become wealthy overnight by hook or by crook. And so I took the wrong path. I got so engrossed in robbery and deceit.. ...that I even forgot my Savitri, my love. One day, Savitri asked me to choose.. ...between love and wealth, and I chose wealth. Savitri got disheartened and left me.. ...and I didn't meet her again. I became free after she left, and.. ...then I started my chain of ruthlessness. My men have told that you have some work from me. No, no I had told them clearly.. ...that I don't want to sell this hotel. But they must also told you that I have to buy this hotel. Mr. Marco this is highhandedness. Yes it is, but I'm also paying you for it. - A good price. Kunta. - Yes. No no, take this money away, I, don't want it. Rs. 80 lakhs is not a small amount Mr. Raj Mehta. And you can't even say that I'm snatching this hotel from you. But why should I see it? - Because Marco wants to buy it. Bhardwaj. It's not a bad deal Mr. Raj Mehta. Take it. Look I'm requesting you. It's good if we have good relations. Or else I'm already a spoilt person. You can't do anything to me. Mr. Raj Mehta, I'm behaving in a civilized manner, and.. ...it'll be better if you do the same too. Thank you very much Mr. Raj Mehta. You are not only an intelligent.. ...person, you're also a smart businessman. You have wisely saved yourself a great loss for your life. Or else you too would have troubles and I too would have a problem. Police, jail, law. And these aren't good for the bad, nor for the good. You and I should keep away from them. Good-bye Mr. Raj Mehta. - Kunta. - Hmm. Who is it? What they want? What have you people done? Hey, my money. Somebody stop them. They took my money. Please, somebody stop them. Marco sir. - Yes I'll call you later. - Marco sir, Marco sir. I've been robbed and looted. - Why, what happened? Mr. Marco he says that your men has.. ...snatched his bag in which there were Rs. 80 lakhs. What are you talking? - You have taken everything of mine. You've taken all my hard earned money. Return it back to me. Whom are you talking to? - Return it. Return it. He's in a state a shock. Mr. Marco, I know that I have no evidence.. ...and I also know that this is your work. Return his money to him. - You will tell.. ...me to return his hotel too, is it? I have done a proper business. I have paid him the money and purchased his hotel. Why should I worry as to what happens outside? Now this hotel is mine. - This hotel is mine. This hotel is mine. I've put my blood and sweat in this. And now has this hotel become yours? This is mine today and it will always be so, do you understand? Kaushalya, you don't be afraid, ok? I'll bring the money right now. - You don't be afraid. - Be calm. There he goes. Hey you hey you. Catch him. Catch him. Where will he escape? - Wait, stop. No. No. Oh no. I'll not leave you, Marco, ever. Merciless man. Do you think that you can hide your sin? Just as you have cheated us somebody will cheat you. You too will die like this. God will never forgive you. Never forgive you. You'll want to live, but you'll neither be able to live nor die. This is my curse to you from a mother and a helpless woman. Greetings, Marco sir. - Greetings. How are you Mr. Bhuleshwar? How did you come to me today? Sir.. You know this very well, my master. Why does a weak person come to a strong person? Why? What's wrong? I had given my land for lease and license to RK college. Now the lease has expired but the.. ...college people are not vacating the place. You, see sir, I need some money. Then what should be done? - You buy it. - Why? I know that you will be able to vacate it. Don't think Mr. Marco. The place is worth Rs. 10 crores. Just give Rs. 70 crores. If you vacate.. ...it then the full amount will be yours. What do you say Kunta? - Take it boss. The place is good. I've seen it. Ok, then we'll take it in your name. - Thank you boss. You'll also remember me. - Thank you. Ok, sir. Come and take the money tomorrow. - Ok. I'll raze the college building. Get, out of the way, get out. Move, give way. Stop it. - I've bought this place. This is my place. Move out. Nothing will happen if the college stands on this land.. Of yours, but if the college closes then.. ...the careers of these poor children will be spoilt. I'll take care of the girls. I'll make a hotel here. I'll keep all of them. They'll do business. Shut up, shameless person. - Get out. Stop. - Come and die under my bulldozer. You don't worry, nothing will happen. I know whose men they are. All this has happened because of that widow. Or else how long would it take us to raze that building? Savitri. Savitri, when did you come? Who is that Savitri? Savitri, please listen to me. I've come by seeing Savitri's photo in the papers. When did you come? - Some days ago. You've come today, but never come here again. But how did all this happen? Why the white sari? Because my daughter is mad. Although she cannot wear the bridal dress of your name, she can wear a white sari of your name. What? - Yes. My daughter had decided not to marry.. ...on the day when you decided to.. ...leave her love and go for the riches. My daughter has never forgiven herself, Marco.. ...the reason being that she had loved.. ...a cheap inhuman person like you. She destroyed all her desires, aspirations and dreams. She has been grinding in between love and hate Marco. And you are responsible for her being so. You are a criminal in Savitri's eyes. You are a criminal in the eyes of a father. No. No. Savitri, Savitri, listen to me. Savitri, listen. Open the door. Please Savitri. Open the door. Savitri, I've come to ask forgiveness from you. I've come to ask your forgiveness.. ...Savitri, please listen to me. Listen to me Savitri. Savitri, I promise you that I'll leave all this. I'll close all my businesses Savitri. I'm telling you the truth. I'm telling the truth, Savitri. Savitri believe me. When I didn't want to listen to you, didn't I tell you clearly? Now I'm giving you my word. I'll leave all these jobs. You don't believe me do you? I'm giving it to you in writing with my blood. What have you done? - You good people.. ...value the cost of blood isn't it? I'll write it in my blood. Maybe, then you people will believe me. Amar. I am leaving all these ...wrong businesses. We will never be separated. I am Tripathi here. - I want to give you good news. Don't think of it as a joke. I want to surrender. But yes, after two days. - Two days. Can I know the reason for these two days? I've decided that I'll give this hotel back.. ...to Kaushalya Raj Mehta. Hey boss. - I'll have to make the transfer papers. Then I have to surrender my entire wealth to the government. I have to confess all my crimes, and prepare.. ...the surrender papers. To do all these things it'll obviously take some time, isn't it? I want to believe you, Mr. Marco. Ok I'll wait for you. Thank you inspector. Now you just wait. Boss, I'm still saying that you're acting in haste. Have we been born to become saints? God will ask us that I had sent you to do wrong things. How did you do good things? Now you tell me boss, what will I answer him? I too used to think in the same manner Kunta. But as soon as I got love my thoughts have changed. Go, look the casino. - Boss listen to me. You can leave everything. I'll take care of everything. Raj, prepare the files. We have.. ...to return everything in two days. - That RK place too? Ok, I'll not return that. Bhardwaj, give the place.. ...on leave license to the college, for 20 years. But be sure to write in the agreement that if the.. ...college manages to gather Rs. 3 lakhs, after 20 years.. ...then the lease can be extended. What are you doing boss? - Don't be too greedy. Boss this.. Enough, there's no need to say anything. You've been talking for a long time. Do as I've told. Go. You go too Bhardwaj. Okay boss. Savitri. You're happy isn't it? - Yes very much. Now, quickly, we want a small one in the house. Hello? - Tripathi has come. Shall I send him up? - No I'll come down. - Ok sir. Who's it? - Mr. Tripathi has come. I have to surrender myself tomorrow isn't it? Maybe he wants to talk something about it. I'll be right back, ok? Come. Here come. You want to give all our wealth to the government isn't it? You wanted to give us all up to the law is it? Kunta, it's true that we have to suffer the fruits of bad deeds. What you are doing today is the fruit of my bad deed. You too will have to suffer the same fate. Now tell us where have you hidden all the wealth? I'll not tell you. - Will you leave it for your wife? She has already discarded this wealth. Look, tell us where you've kept it. Have you kept it in the hotel? Have you kept it in your house? The currency of this country will rot there. Our gold, diamonds and pearls will be useless. You rogue, tell us. - No I won't tell. I'll never tell. You won't tell is it? Ok, your death too will.. ...remain a mystery, just as your black wealth. Nobody will know this secret. Everybody will think that Marco is alive. He has left the country and fled elsewhere. What do you mean? - I mean you will.. ...remain immortal just like your name, Amar Kumar. I'll keep your name alive. Till yesterday you wife had discarded your black wealth isn't it? Now she'll discard your name too throughout her life. I'll go to her to take the college lease papers. No, Kunta, no. Don't harass that goddess or else. Or else what? What will you do after.. ...you die that you're saying or else? Kunta, you want to kill me isn't it? So kill me. No, no. Fools have no right to live. Kill him. Now I'll take care and you, you rest. Pull him down and bury him inside this. Seal it. Is it you god? The protector of the world. Who advices us to take the right path on the one.. ...hand, and on the other who punishes.. ...those who walk along that path. Is this your justice? Until yesterday I was walking the wrong path. I was oppressing people, and you were happy with me. You showed me mercy. And today when I turned a good.. ...leaf, you rewarded me with this. You killed me through the hands of Kunta. You killed me through the hands of Kunta. God is very merciful. He is the ocean of mercy. He's kind and all forgiving. After whatever you have.. ...done to me, Savitri too will disown you. And not only Savitri, but slowly your name.. ...will be erased from the world, oh god. Your name will be wiped out from the world. Your name will be wiped out from the world, oh god. You will have to change your ways. You will have to change your ways. Fool, You are talking of changing destiny. Did you change yourself? What did you do on earth? Destiny never does injustice to anybody. You have yourself abused your life. A man reaps what he sows. And that is destiny. But I should have got punished. Only me. Why this injustice with Savitri? For this too you are responsible. She's paying for your sins. But because of her you'll be given a chance. You will have to wait for such a person who will be.. ...able to hear your voice. He will be the cause of your enlightenment. And when that man remembers me.. ...with true intentions.. ...you'll be able to get out of your.. ...grave and he'll be able to see you. Only he will be able to see you. After you come out of the grave you'll have to.. ...remember these things.. ...You will not be able to show yourself to anybody. If at you try to do it, you won't be able to do it. You will not kill Kunta. You will not use your powers for wrong things. But you can use it to stop any injustice being done to anybody. You will have to do everything with the help of a man. I promise. I promise you god. I promise. I promise. And today after 20years you have heard my voice Sunder. You will have to help me. But how can I help you? Don't worry; You do what I tell you. But what will I do? What will I eat? Where will I stay? I thought.. Why do you worry? If god has chosen you for my.. ...work then he must have thought something for you too. Yes that's right. God does what is best. - You're right. C'mon. - Where to? - First of all I have to meet Savitri. C'mon. What car is this? There are new things come up in the world. But it feels very good to stretch the legs. There is a taxi. C'mon. - But what do.. ...we do with the taxi Mr. ghost? Savitri's house is very far from here. Come. But I don't have the money. - Don't you have money? Why do you worry? Don't fear when I'm here. Go and ask him if he'll go. No, no. Not I, you ask him. Should I ask him? - No he won't hear you. I'll ask him. Brother taxi man will you go? Brother taxi man will you go? He's sleeping. - Ask him again. - Ok. Brother taxi man will you go? - It's not empty man. It's not empty? But there's no body in your taxi. Can't you see the meter is down? What happened? Why did you touch the meter? - I didn't touch it. Why did you touch the meter? Don't get angry brother taxi man. Don't push, O ghost! What are you doing? Don't you worry. I've got the steering wheel in my hand after 20 years. This is wrong, isn't it? - Be wrong with the wrong. Be right with the right. Be careful. Oh god, this ghost is driving very roughly. Please protect me. Please drive carefully. Look I'm getting very scared. Look in front. The police are after you. Stop the car or they'll catch us. I remembered my old days.

That is Mr. Sant. I think he following a robber. C'mon, shall we see? - No. - Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Why fear when I'm here. - Please, leave me. Mr. Sant. Hello Mr. Sant. We'll catch the.. ...thief and bring him to you, right now. Yes, we will catch them right now. C'mon. Hey, who is he? Please. I think there's somebody. Hurry up. Hey, you hit this man very hard. Hurry up. Long live, hanuman. So Mr. Sant we've caught all the goons. Long live India. - Long, live hanuman. Long live India. - Long, live hanuman. Long live India. - Long, live hanuman. What are you? You are the magician of magicians. You are a great magician. What are you? You are this and that. What are you? You are a living miracle. Just a minute Mr. Sant. Just look. First sinner, second sinner. Third sinner. And see now. Gold, gold. - In your control. - You're, blessed you're blessed. Where are your legs? - Oh Sunder hi. - Hello. Isn't Mr. Kaul in? - Why? Will you go if he isn't in? No, it's not that. - Then come on. Sit down - Yes. Sunder? - Yes? - Tell me the truth. - Yes, go on ask. How much do you love me? - What would be.. ...the value of love if it could be measured. Mala, love has no limits, and neither does it have any weight. Love has no accounts. That's why.. ...it's said that love is god and god is love. Oh my god! You talk so sweetly. You should have been a lecturer of literature. Who made you a cricket coach? Yes, no, cricket coach. You know that I fell into trouble whilst going to Bombay. First my baggage was stolen then my purse got picked. I was sitting on a tomb, sad and dejected, just thinking.. ...as to what would happen of me. It was there that I met Marco. - Who? - Marco. Your father. The poor fellow helped me a lot. He saved me from goons. Sunder, I think grandpa has told you everything. Yes, but that is a misconception. You don't have any misconception for a bad man, Sunder. No, no. Mala, don't say that. Listen to what I have to say. I don't want to hear a thing. I hate that dirty person so.. ...much that I consider the person.. ...who talks about him, as my enemy. And I don't want to think of you as my enemy, Sunder. But Mala. - No, means no. My mother used to give me.. ...false hopes that my father will come now, my father.. ...will come now. But he never came.. ...Sunder, he never came. My mother got tired and lost hope. She died yearning for him. My mother loved that devil a lot. And I hate him just as much. Daughter Mala, daughter Mala. Good news, very good news. You are here too, very good. You hear the good news too. What's that sir? - Now it doesn't matter whether we.. ...win or lose the cricket match the arrangements.. ...for Rs. 3 lakhs have been made. You mean we've got a sponsorship for the fashion show? Absolutely. - This is really good news grandpa. We'll have to do a first class fashion show. Of course, of course, I'll start the.. ...preparation from tomorrow itself. It'll be done in two days isn't it? Yes sir it'll surely be done. Well, well, now I can rest easy. They've made the arrangements for the money uncle. What are you saying? How did it happen? Paras textiles are sponsoring them. The sponsorship is of two and a half lakhs. They've kept a fashion show in the college. They'll get Rs. 40 to 50 thousand.. ...from the tickets and souvenirs. And they've got about Rs. 60 to 70 thousand.. ...accumulated from the previous show. Uncle, we'll not be able to take the college land.. ...even after winning the cricket match. Their college will be saved. - I'll never be saved. This time I'll go to the fashion show myself. Youth is madness. It's a little of fire and a little of water. Youth is madness. It's a little of fire and a little of water. The love story begins by the meeting of fire and water. Youth is madness. It's a little of fire and a little of water.

The love story begins by the meeting of fire and water. Youth is madness. It's a little of fire and a little of water. Oh no. Oh my god. Give us back our money. We have to meet Mr. Kaul. - You'll have to repay our losses. Or else give us back our money. Yes we want our money. - Please be quiet. Why should we be quiet? Oh Mr. Shetty. - Hello sir. I'm sorry sir. This is today's collection, Rs. 1 lakh, sir. Mr. Kaul said that I should hand it over to you. - Ok. He has gone to the commissioner. And I'm going too. The train is early in the morning, sir. Train? - Yes sir, don't you know sir? I'm leaving this place sir. I'm going permanently sir. Ok, ok. - Salutations, thank you. Now we'll be able to collect Rs. 3 lakhs for the college. We have to win the cricket match, that's all. Sir, it's too dark outside, sir. Please.. ...reach me to my room sir. You are getting scared isn't it? No, no. I'm not getting scared. But sometimes we have to get scared. I saw that pot sir and that's why I'm scared. I'll reach you not only to your room, but also to your village. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Be careful. He'll save the college on the basis of cricket. He doesn't know that all this money will go.. ...towards repaying the losses at the function. Come on, tell me. Yes sir, what do you want to play? - Listen. - One minute. The bets are placed at Rs. Eight. 8.. Yes sir. Rs.1 lakh on R.K. college. - It's a good game. Right. These people are big fools. Hello yes sir. Bombay race? Yes thunderbolt won in the last race. Yes, it's ok. - Will you not take our bets today? You played just now. - Did we? No, no. What is my mistake Monty baba? Shetty, you bastard. Do you recognize this envelope? Yes. - There were Rs. 1 lakh in this. Who put the bet on R.K. and Dayal? Tell me. I don't know Mr. Monty. I'm leaving.. ...this place permanently. I'm going to my native place. Then who bet at two o'clock at night? I don't know Mr. Monty. I had given this money to Sunder. Now there will be fun in the game, and Sunder will go to jail. Hello! - Who is it? Father-in-law? Who is that insolent on the line? - Mind your words.. ...you principal of the sinking college! This is Kunta here. The real successor of that land. You needn't call here. Your money will reach you. The money has already reached! Full one lakh! What? Who had given it? Your person! What's his name.. Yes Sunder Shrivastav! Don't talk nonsense. This isn't nonsense, sir. He gave one lakh of the college money to me, last night. So that your college and you, both can go to hell. Now you will ask for the evidence. So don't worry, everything is under control. You will get the evidence. The envelope in which one lakh rupees was given.. ...has been sent to you as a proof. So you've got it, right? Pick it up and check out. It is the same envelope, right? It carries a 100 Rs. Note in it. Get the window pane changed with that money. I am hanging up now, ok? - Inspector, come with me. - Ok. Mr. Marco is no where. Mr. Kaul!? Sunder, give back the money which was give to you for safekeeping. Come, I had kept it here, safely. The whole amount of one lakh.. ...is kept here, safely. Hey.. ...where has it gone? I had kept it here only. Inspector, arrest this man. Your secret is out, Mr. Sunder. Your own people have brought you out in open. They don't need you anymore, perhaps. What are you saying? - You aren't Marco's aide. I am. But I will tell that to you later. But the money.. You have already siphoned off the money and given to Kunta. - I? - Don't act. The proof is this evelope. But this.. You are under arrest Mr. Sunder Shrivastav. Listen to me Mr. Kaul sir. I don't know where the money is gone sir. I'm not a thief sir; I haven't met Kunta till today sir. This is plot to frame me sir. Tell, them sir, listen to me. Oh god, I had agreed to help Marco with your name. And today, by doing your will.. ...I've fallen from the eyes of Mr.Kaul. Why are you punishing me? Protect, me my god, protect me. Sunder. - Marco.. Do you know that Kunta has proved that I am your man. And that Rs.1 lakh of yesterday... I cannot understand as to how it reached him. I thought that if R.K. wins they'll get Rs. 8 lakhs.. ...and so I placed the bet with Kunta's men. And I forgot that envelope there itself. What have you done? You gambled with all the money. You don't worry. I'll see that the college wins. How will you make it win? By cheating? Then what by batting or bowling? I'll definitely do cheating. - Definitely not. If our students are capable, then they'll win it by themselves. They are not capable of winning. It doesn't matter. Let it go. Don't try to.. ...spoil their character by winning by cheating. I'm not doing it for spoiling or making their character. It's my duty to save the college. I placed the bet because.. - You should be ashamed. You should be ashamed. You want to make them like you. What will be the difference between honest.. ...hardworking students and that Kunta. And what will be the difference between.. ...these innocent and naïve boys and Marco. Mind what you say, Sunder. - Forget it now. I don't trust you Mr. ghost. You have shown your true colors. Mala is so unfortunate that she is your daughter. Don't bring my daughter in between us. Why will I not do that? Why will I not do that? Because of you those people are thinking.. ...that I'm a robber, smuggler and cheat. They are thinking that I'm a sinner like you. I've come to know everything Mr. Ghost. I've come to know everything. If your daughter is hating you then.. ...she's not doing anything wrong. That's enough, Sunder, that's enough. Or else I'll raise my hand. Hit me then, hit me. Strangulate me. Kill me, kill me. Show your true self. You told me a false.. ...story of enlightenment and trapped me. You are a bad soul. You were bad when you were alive, and you've still not improved yourself. You are a ghost that's troubling living people. And you are still troubling them. The fact is that you can never do any good to anybody. All right then, I don't want any enlightenment. Let the college go to the dogs. Let every thing go to the dogs. I don't want anybody's help. Never again will I come to you. I'll keep roaming all around, but I'll never come to you. I'm not a robber mother. And nor is Kunta a good man. I know my son. I'm sure about it. My old eyes may not see anything else. But they can see an honest face. No, mother, no. Everybody has miSunderstood me. Mr. Kaul, Mala, all of them miSunderstands me. No brother, look over there. They don't miSunderstand you. Listen, Mr. inspector, Sunder sir has been framed. It's a dangerous plot. It's a false blame on Sunder, sir. Ok, ok. Even if I believe what you say.. ...I cannot release him without bail, isn't it? How much would be the amount? - Rs. 10,000. - RS. 10,000? Do you have it? - I'll give the bail. I'll give the bail of that great man. - Mr. Sant, you? - Yes Malhotra. He's not a man. He's a prophet. He's a pious soul. He's miraculous. As soon as the constable told me I came immediately. Take this bail of yours. - Sepoy, release Sunder. You are the umpire for tomorrow's match isn't it? Yes, Mr. Rane and I too. - I have nothing to do with Rane. I want you to do the umpiring in favor of Dayal college. That you will do. In lieu of that I wish to reward you. You will get that. - I've understood what you want to say sir. That's all. Tomorrow, after the match you'll get your.. ...reward of Rs. 1 lakh. That too cash, in black. You won't have to give the government any tax for that. The match is going to start. The fielders of Dayal.. ...college have spread out. The stadium is packed to.. ...the fullest with the students of R.K. college.. ...and Dayal college. This is the final match and the winner.. ...will get a cash prize of Rs. 2 lakhs. The fielding pattern is like this. The captain of Dayal is himself at silly point. Sayed is at extra cover. He's the fielder on the off side. R.K. Best of luck boys. Play well. R.K. Even if we win this match, we'll have just two lakhs. One lakh will still be required. If at all we return Kunta's ticket, we'll get that 1 lakh too. Give the ticket back. - Ticket? What ticket sir? Keep clapping. R.K. I knew that you'll.. ...realize your folly, albeit a little late. Don't talk rubbish. Even if have to face the biggest.. ...difficulties, I'll not waver from the truth. Then why do you want the ticket? I've decided to return this ticket to Kunta and get a lakh. Take it and go. You can surely go. But I'll not wish you luck. This ball and this.. Here is Kunta. Go, go touch his feet and take his blessings. - Yes. Greetings, sir. Myself Sunder Shrivastav. I'm the coach of R.K. college, sir. Oh I see, so you are the one. I've heard that you're very brave. Tell me what the matter is? Sir, return our Rs. 1 lakh. Here is your bet ticket. Your team is losing. What were you thinking when you placed the bet? I didn't place it. It was placed by, Mr. Marco. Why are you catching me by the neck? Where is he? Which Marco are you talking about? The one whom you killed. How do you know the secret, which is 20 years old? Marco's ghost told it to me. - The ghost told you? Then you tell your ghost that Kunta does.. ...not return the money from the bet. Now you can go. Are you going or not? This ball is bowled to Rawat. Rawat drives it to cover. Rawat has taken two runs and he's coming back for.. ...the third and he has made it but he been given out. No, no. - The players of Dayal college are celebrating but the R.K. players don't agree with the umpire. Audience is very excited. Rao is surprised.. The players are agitated. They don't agree with the decision. Come on. - Out, out you go I say. And I'm changing the board. Sir, this is.. Go, Rakesh, play well, ok? Best of luck. I was not out LBW sir. - It's all right. What can we do? Why can't we do anything sir. You see now. - No. - But the ball hit the pad. Is the umpire blind? - This fellow of ours have.. ...come to the field by being blind and deaf. Howzzat. All eyes are on the captain of R.K. Everybody have a lot of hopes. And here comes Monty to bowl. And Rakesh hit it. The fielder got the ball and.. Oh Rakesh. C'mon get out of the way. Let the air in. C'mon. I'm sorry sir, I'm very, very sorry. I was trying to hit the wicket and he came in between. Sorry sir. Bloody idiot, he doesn't know to play. Look. Sir, it's impossible for us to win now. They are cheating very badly. No, no. Rakesh don't lose hope. There is victory in this defeat of ours. - Ok sir. Go, and rest. It's not hurting you is it? Play properly, ok? - Yes why not. And after losing Sunder uncle will give each one a toffee. Howzzat. And here goes the seventh wicket. The ball went to the wicket keeper's.. ...gloves, without touching the bat. Marco was right. These people are bad. Why don't you do something? - What? I'm talking to you. - Are you telling the one on top? Yes the one on top. Are you listening to me or not? - Yes. They are going on cheating and you're watching them. Why should I say anything uselessly.. ...when nobody can hear me? And that's the fall of the eight wicket. Look, look at the sad face of Mr. Kaul. See how sad Mala is. Mr. Marco, think, think of these poor students. I don't have to think. I'm a ghost. And a ghost can never do any good for anybody. No, no. Don't do this. For god's sake don't do this. Why are you punishing these people for my folly? What have they spoilt of yours? How is that! This way, you're helping your own killer. The killer who snatched your Savitri from you. The killer who after killing you, turned.. ...your own daughter to think bad about you. You are trying to help that killer who wants.. ...to play with your daughter's modesty. He wants to play with their lives. That's a four. I think that god has listened to us. RK. He threw the ball towards the boundary. What are you doing? Go bring the ball. RK. How is that? Isn't he out? Wasn't he out? He was out. And this is the first ball of the last over. Hit a four, a six, and an eight. Son of a gun, hit it. And this could be an easy catch. Very very easy. The cap betrayed him. What's wrong? Has Tripathi come? What are you doing? You're also cheating. No, I'm not cheating. I'm doing the same thing that lord Krishna did with Arjun. Is it done now? And so the innings of R.K. college comes to an end. Tripathi has come. He used to be an inspector at some time. Now he has become a very big man. Go talk to him. What should I say to him? - Tell him each and.. ...everything that I've told you. Everything. Kunta will have to lose his life along with the match. Go on. But, you take care of these dishonest people. They can do anything. - Don't worry. None of their tricks will work today. Welcome. - Salutations. - Sir this is the same miraculous man of whom I had told you. No sir, I'm not a miraculous man. I want to talk to you about Marco. - About whom? Sir, the same Marco who wanted to.. ...surrender to you 20 years ago. And he fooled us all and fled this country... No sir, it's not like that. Just listen to me. No sir, he died 20 years ago. - What? What is this fellow talking to Tripathi about? Boss, I think this boy is very dangerous to us. Then don't waste time. This Tripathi.. ...will have something to remember. Just as Marco disappeared... ...this fellow also will disappear and Tripathi will be looking for him. And at present too he's in the field to save R.K. sir. Look my son. Whatever you have told me about Marco.. ...was known either to Marco or to me. But I don't believe in this ghost talk. This is true sir. What I used to think was magic .. ...was all Marco's doing. - Yes sir. You can see it in the match. I'm going. He must be telling you stories about ghosts. Mr. Kaul, whatever he told me.. ...about Marco is all true. I know that. Come. The bowling will have to be done with great responsibility. Because 65 runs is not a big score to defend. What's this, the ball stopped suddenly. - Pick up the ball. This is the last ball of the over. - Howzzat. - He is out. Howzzat! This ball went far.. - Catch. And he's out. Bold. Take him fast. And he has steered it with the bat. Empire has to decide about what has to be done. And another ball. The ball is in the air. He has caught the ball. A beautiful catch. It was a very beautiful catch. No body has ever taken such a catch.. ...and nobody will ever take it again. How are you playing you fool? I feel that the fielders are playing well. - I can say that. I also think that Tripathi uncle's doubts are true. Where's Malhotra? I think that this match is gone from our hands. What's there to think boss? Think that it is gone. Take that fellow and go to the cemetery. - C'mon. You go while I reach. - Come let's go! - RK. RK. - I'll be back grandpa. - Ok. You are a great coach sir. You are a great person. What are you doing? What is this that you are doing? Sunder, leave, him alone. Hold it, stop. Hold it, stop. Oh, my one lakh rupees. Those who try to challenge R.K. will bite the dust. Well done, well done. Well done my boys. Mr. Kaul, Mr. Kaul. Kunta's men took away Sunder and Mala. What? - Don't worry sir. Mr. Marco is with us. Give the instructions that they.. ...have to surround Marco's hotel. Do you recognize it? I had done this to your father. You too see it. You two have.. ...become very dangerous to me. Like Marco. That's why I'll put both of you in this grave, like Marco. What are you looking at my face? Put both of them inside. Now both of you celebrate your honeymoon in this itself. Seal both of them. Seal them. Sir, sir. There's some bad news. - What's it? There was a phone from the hotel. The police have raided the place. - What? The police have surrounded it on all sides. They are looking for you. There have been roadblocks. You have to stay here for sometime. It's in your best interest. Does Tripathi dare do this? Come, come here. The safe is here. The safe is here. Why don't they listen to me? The safe is here. It's, not there Tripathi, it's here. Here, here. See here. There's the safe sir. All the evidence is in that. That boy was right. C'mon. Break it. We couldn't find Sunder and Mala anywhere. Where have they gone? - Save us. - Sunder. All this is ok, but where are my children? This is Marco sir. He wants to take us somewhere. Follow, him sir, follow him. Follow him. Come sir. - Come this side sir. Long live hanuman the son of the wind. Marco. The grave is opening Sunder. Marco. It's good that you've come. Or else.. ...Kunta had almost buried us here. Both of us would have died. Thank you. Come Mala. Mala, my son, are you all right? - Yes grandpa. Where's Kunta? - We don't know sir. He's not to seen here sir. Malhotra. - Yes sir. - You go to Kunta's house.. ...and arrest him and bring him here. Come on, hurry up. Sunder, we not only got Marco's wealth.. ...but he brought us here too. So Tripathi, have you too started believing in ghosts? I didn't expect this from you. But I was certain, Kunta that one day I'll manage to arrest you. Hey Tripathi, shut up your mouth. What are you looking at? Why aren't you doing something? How are you? Thank you. Thank you, thank you, Marco. Thank you. Where is he? Come on, Marco. Sunder, make him confess all his.. ...crimes in the presence of Tripathi. Listen Mr. Tripathi to what he's saying. He's not saying anything. Ask him who killed Marco. Tell us, who killed Marco? I, have killed him, I have killed him. Are you listening Tripathi? - Are you listening Tripathi? Ask him why he did it? Tell us why did you kill him. Marco was going to close our.. ...business that's why I killed him. I'm responsible for it. I've killed him. No, father, no. - Yes Amar don't.. ...soil your hands with the blood of this rogue. Don't spoil your enlightenment, my son. You had promised to be good isn't it? Sir, sir, I've taken out a live man.. ...from the grave for the first time sir. Take him. - C'mon. - Take him away. - My child. - Daddy, daddy. Sunder. - Yes? - Tell Mr. Kaul that he should.. ...get you and Mala married in a very grand way. - Yes. - Tell him. Tell him. Mr. Kaul. Marco is saying that, I'm telling.. ...you that there is a school in our village too. It's not like your college, but it's there. - Marriage marriage. Marriages too take place in a grand way in our village. Sunder and Mala's wedding. Yes, Marco is saying that you.. ...should open a school for me, and Mala. School? Yes school. Sure. Sure. Mala touch his feet. No, no. Here. May you live long my daughter. May you live long my daughter. Sunder, daddy has not come as yet. You don't worry. He must be coming now. There he's come. We are waiting for you for so long. C'mon, now perform the opening with you good hands. C'mon, c'mon. God bless you, god bless you. God bless you. - Mr. Marco Mr. Marco. I'm going Sunder. Good-bye. Ok, Mr. Marco. Good-bye. Just a minute, just a minute please. One minute. I got a chance, maybe you will not. That's why fill in your account of good deeds from now itself. Ok. Ready.
