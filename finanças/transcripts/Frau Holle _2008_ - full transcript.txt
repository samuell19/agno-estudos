Scissors and knifes, I sharpen them all! I have brushes and brooms! And household needs! I have brushes and brooms! - Good morning, Timor. - Morning. Hmm, that smells good. I’ll fetch a bread afterwards, okay? - As usual. - And household needs! Good morning, Timor. Good morning, Timor. Wait, Timor. Ah, the brushes. Indeed. Here you go. Scissors and knifes, I sharpen them all! I have brushes... - Timor, good morning. - Madam innkeeper. - Could I get these back today? - But of course. See you this afternoon. Sharpened as new. In a small village, many, many years ago, there lived a widow with two daughters – Marie and Louise. - Hello. - Hello. The two were as different from each other as you can imagine. Marie – the eldest of the two – was modest, friendly, and diligent. And she helped her mother whenever she could. Good morning, Struppi. Louise, on the other hand, was always concerned with herself, spoiled and lazy. Let me have some peace. Why do you do that, Louise? Your stupid dog disturbs my sleep. Why is he here again? Come, Struppi. Go outside. Won’t you get up, Louise? Today is Saturday. What do I care? But on Saturday it’s your turn to do the chores in the house. Mother said so. So what? You do it! Or else I’ll tell her you let Struppi sleep in your bed again. When Father was still alive, he was allowed in the house at night. He doesn’t bother anyone, does he? He does! Me! I bet he has fleas. I would be glad to be rid of him. Struppi? Oh, Struppi, don’t worry. Louise doesn’t mean it. Oh, Struppi, it was so nice when Father was still alive. I miss him so much. I know, you miss him too. - Good morning, Marie. - Good morning, Johann. Will you give this bread to your mother, with my greetings? I will do that. But... you know already it is no use. Oh, somehow I will find out which bread your mother loves. And then she’ll hear me out. What is it today? I don’t know, mother, but it smells good. That doesn’t mean a thing. Good morning, Louise. - Good morning, Mother. - Did you sleep well? What is this? A nut, Mother. Has that baker gone mad? I almost broke my tooth. I think it tastes... unusual. And I’m sure he meant well. He’s a foolish guy. Hurry up! A pile of laundry awaits, a basket of wool needs to be spun. Mother? I think I’m ill. This whole morning I’m feeling so... weak. Oh, you do look pale, my child. You’d better lie down. You do the washing, Marie. Greetings, Madam Weaver. Did my new bread please you? It did please my geese. Nuts in a bread – I never saw such a stupid thing. Greetings, Madam Innkeeper. Greetings, Madam Weaver. Are my tablecloths ready? No, but when you send your son this evening, you will get them. Can’t one of your daughters do that? N-no, I-I’ll d-do that w-with pleasure, Mother. For you. Because you have to work so much. Thank you. And when Marie was finished with her chores, she carried a spinning wheel and a big basket full of wool towards the old water well. Hello, Marie. - Hello. - I haven’t seen Louise yet. No, she’s still in bed. She has an unknown, new illness. Oh, poor thing. Does that mean she won’t make it to the village feast, tomorrow? Don’t worry. As I know her, she’ll be cured miraculously before that. Hopefully. - Say hello from me. - Yes. ♪ The merry month of May Fills my whole heart with joy. ♪ ♪ When only I take a glance At the flowers in the meadows, ♪ ♪ And hear the birds sing, Oh, how it sounds so lovely. ♪ There you are, at last. Mother says, one of us needs to prepare dinner. I’m going to bed. I’m dead-tired. And I am ill. - Good night. - Marie! What’s that brooch? Come, Struppi. What’s going on? What do you want? I just wanted to check the dog. He made these strange groans. Go back to bed, Louise. You’re scaring him. And me too. Where did you get this brooch? Timor gave it to me. You’re lying! Why would he give you something so precious? - You stole it! - No! Give it back. You already have a necklace from Father! And he also gave you Struppi! He was always fonder of you! That’s not true, Louise. Fine, you can keep it. Good boy, Struppi. Everything is all right. Not bad. But far too sweet. I’ll find the bread that you like. Just give it up, baker. You’ll never find it out. Mother, can I go to the village festival, this afternoon? Have you recovered already? Very well. But only for one hour. - And me? - Only when you’re finished weaving. It would go quicker if Louise would help me. You know how tender her fingers are, and unskilled. She would only slow you down. Well, what do you think of these toy windmills? - Which one would you like? - That one. This one, right? It spins very nicely. Oh, nice. Thank you. How are you doing here? We still have some, thanks. We’re fine. W-would you l-like to d-dance? Dance? With pleasure! But not with you. And so things unfolded the way they were supposed to be. Whilst the music played on the village green, and everyone was having fun, Marie was sitting with her spinning wheel by the well, and worked until her fingers were sore. Oh, dear. What do I do now? Oh, no... Struppi, what should I do now? Mother will have my head. The spindle! Thanks, Struppi. So, finally done sleeping? Is someone there? Yes, me! Or am I perhaps invisible? But... how come... you can speak? “But how come you can speak?” Why not? You can also speak, can’t you? I think I’m dreaming. Where... am I? Hm, well... With Mother Frost, where else? And who is that? Hm... Mother Frost is... everything – summer and winter, rain and snow. By the way, my name is Gustav. And who are you? I... My name is Marie. Could you tell me how I can get home, Gustav? But that’s my necklace! Mine! Yours! La-di-doors! I just borrowed it. But why would a raven need a necklace? I can tell you exactly. Every single bird has something special with which to stand out – a beautiful beak, great feathers, a lovely voice – but me, I don’t have anything! Absolutely nothing! No! What’s so funny about that? Hm? Nothing. I’m sorry. With this necklace I will stand out. I will hardly be able to cope with all the offers. You can forget about that. He’s looking for a mate, and the jewel makes him irresistible, so he thinks. And who are you? Limonella, at your service. Well, not yet, but... quite soon. As soon as I can get out of this horrible coat. Could you help me? I’m sorry. My fingers are too thick. Well? How do you like my earrings? Very beautiful. So I can have my necklace back, right? Only when I have found a wife. And you think the necklace will help you? But of course! But perhaps the raven women will only see the necklace, - and the cherries. - No-no-no. Pull us out! Pull us out! Or else we’ll burn! We have long been baked through! You’re looking lovely. For whom have you been baked, breads? Mother Frost, Mother Frost. Right. Does that mean she lives close by? You again. Yes, me again. Tell me, what did you mean, before, that everyone will only pay attention to my jewellery? Well, do you want a raven woman to love you or your jewellery? Me, of course. Shake me and rattle me! Shake me and rattle me! All my apples are juicy and ripe! You poor thing. If I shake you, then your apples will get bruised. No, no. Just shake me calmly. The ground is soft. Yes. That’s it. More. More. Try some more. That’s such a relief. My branches were so heavy. I thank you. Choose an apple. It tastes... delicious! Thank you, dear apple tree! Hello. Here I am again. Limonella! You’re gorgeous. Oh, thank you! I finally crawled out of this hot coat. A wonderful feeling! By the way, I can see the house of Mother Frost. - Is that...? - Yes. That is Mother Frost. Doesn’t she look like... like a sun? You will love her, and never wish to leave. Hello, Marie. Good that you’ve found me. I’ve been waiting for you. But... how did you know...? Come in. Our meal is ready. Actually, I wanted to ask you how to get back home. - I fell into a well. - I know. And then woke up in a flower meadow. Don’t you want to come in, first? You must be hungry. No, I... There. Enjoy, my child. Thank you. Even when my father was still alive, we never had such a full table. Yes. You can have this every day, from now on. You just have to tidy the house, water the flowers, and regularly fluff up the beds. And nothing more? Nothing more. But my mother and my sister, they’re waiting for me. They need me. You know, it’s been a while since someone was here, and it would make me very happy if you could keep me company for a bit, and if you could help me in my housekeeping. Only for a little while. You certainly won’t regret it. Yes? For seven days and seven nights the villagers were searching for Marie. In vain. Some thought she had run away, others were convinced something had happened to her. Only Struppi knew what had happened and kept watch at the water well. Poor Struppi. Are you still waiting for Marie? You’re half-starved. Follow me to the village. Come on, that isn’t so difficult? Marie could do this instantly. My fingers are much more sensitive. - They’re not made for such labour. - Then they need to learn. I cannot weave and spin at the same time. Look closely. Can’t we give the wool to a weaving mill? Have you lost your mind? In a few days you’ll have callus on your fingers, and then you won’t even feel the threads anymore. I wish Marie would come back. He-hello, L-Louise. C-can I... C-can I h... I c-can h-help you. “He-hello, L-Louise. C-can I h...” You’re driving me nuts, Frieder! Go away! Here, you can have your necklace back. Thank you. Have you found a wife? No! They only have eyes for this necklace! What do you think of me, by the way? I mean, as a raven. If you were a raven, would I please you? Yes, very. Yes? And why? You have such beautiful black feathers, and you are funny and never boring. And I think you’re clever and wise. Yeah? Marie? I’ve finished. How do you like it? Is that for me? It won’t fit me. By the beak of my grandmother! That looks great! It’s wonderful! Thank you. You’re welcome. Wait. Meanwhile winter was about to arrive. And from Marie... there still wasn’t any trace. Madam Weaver, you promised me three cloths in three different colours. There is no distinction at all! What should I do? Louise, bring the flock into the stable, it’s cold outside. Must I do everything myself? As if I am the maid! Does Louis always raise her voice like this? Much worse is her ineptness at weaving. Marie is missed in every aspect. Hey, Marie! I found a wife! - I’m very glad for you, Gustav. - Yeah! And? Is she pretty? Yeah! Yeah! There is none prettier! Marie... I have an assignment for you. You need to shake it well, every day. For winter has come over the earth. Nature needs to rest, and the snow lies, like a warming coat, over all plants. So that they’re protected against the frost, and wake up in the new spring to a new life. Does that mean that, whenever it snows on earth, then you are shaking the pillows? Well, then I will really do my best, so that everyone will have a wonderful winter! It hasn’t snowed this much in a long time! Do you have something for the eyes and nose? Go, Frieder! Get two pieces of coal and a carrot. Tell me, do you enjoy doing that? What do you mean? Winter has lasted long enough. Why so? It’s warm and cosy in here. And I don’t want the snow to melt. I do. When spring arrives, people will need new clothes. Thank you, Marie. You’ve really been very diligent. Now it is time for spring to arrive. My house! After having lived in fear for many months, the people had almost forgotten about Marie. Hi, Timor! I’ve been waiting for weeks for you to arrive. All my knives and scissors have dulled during winter. Always at your service, Madam Weaver. Is there any news of Marie? What’s wrong with you, Marie? You look so sad. You can tell me if anything is bothering you. I never had it so good as with you, Mother Frost, you have to believe me. And I am truly grateful for that. But...? I miss my Struppi so much. And all the others too. With you it’s a thousand-fold nicer, but my home is with my mother. And with my sister. In my village. You’re homesick. I understand, Marie, even though it saddens me that you wish to leave from here. For you have a special place in my heart. But I also know that you cannot stay here forever. Come, my child. I will show you the way. Thank you! I thought it was lost. I kept it for you, all this time. Take care, Marie. May happiness always guide you. This gate will lead to your house. And you’ll receive your reward for your diligence and your kindness. Look! It’s Marie! Cock a doodle doo! Cock a doodle doo! The golden maiden has returned to you! Struppi! Dear Struppi, I’ve missed you too. Marie! Is it really you? Of course. Don’t you recognise me, Sebastian? You just look so different; so... radiant. - Thank you. - You have returned! My child! A miracle! And look at you! So beautiful! And in winter I shook the pillows, so that it snowed on earth, and so nature could rest. You have to know that it is Mother Frost who takes care of everything. You don’t believe me. Most important is that you’re back, Marie. And the spindle that fell into the well, did you find it? That is not our spindle. - Where did you get it? - Mother Frost gave it to me. No doubt – gold! Imagine what we could get when we sell it! But with what can I spin if we sell it? With no other spindle do I spin faster than with this one. That’s true. And that’s worth a lot. Louise is terrible at spinning. I had to do everything myself. Can I help it that I have such soft fingers? But I’m back again. And all you had to do was household chores and fluffing up beds? And every day there was delicious food, like you never seen before. And this dress, here. It was given to me. And at the beginning, when you fell into the well, weren’t you at all afraid? No. It all went too fast for that. I pricked myself with the spindle and wanted to wash it off in the well. And then... then I don’t know. Until I woke up in the flower meadow. Good night, Louise. The following Saturday the entire village celebrates the happy return of Marie. People gathered from everywhere. And everyone was enchanted by Marie, and wanted to be with her. Hello, Marie. I’d like to dance with you, too. You’ve stopped stuttering, Frieder! Indeed! Did you hear it? I can talk without stuttering! And nobody, absolutely nobody, paid any attention to Louise. Potato bread! It tastes exactly the potato bread from my childhood! It’s wonderful. Oh, please give me another piece. As much as you wish, Madam Weaver. But first... May I have this dance? Louise had never felt so alone in all her life. And, because she didn’t know what to do about it, she decided to do the same as Marie. Without anyone noticing it, she left the festival. A deserted landscape, a massive amount of flowers... Disgusting animals... This must be the place. Hey, what are you doing? Do you want to kill me? They really do talk. Hey, caterpillar, where can I find Mother Frost’s house? I don’t know. I only see blades of grass and flower stems. But if you help me out of this tight cocoon, then I can tell you. I certainly won’t touch you again. I can imagine. May I introduce myself? Gustav. Stay away from me. Ravens bring ill fortune. Well, who is telling such nonsense? Everyone knows it. Ravens are hideous. They steal every that shimmers. Ha! I think you’re mixing up a few things, my dear. Magpies steal. And crows bring ill fortune. Ravens, on the other hand, are clever and wise. Hey, Gustav! If you’re really so clever, then you can surely tell me the quickest way to Mother Frost’s house. Of course I can. But I don’t want to! Suit yourself, stupid bird. Pull us out! Pull us out! Or else we’ll burn! We have long been baked through! You think I’m crazy? I’m not going to burn my fingers. Then again... I’m quite hungry. Will you give me a piece? Get yourself some. Then do you know the way to Mother Frost’s house in the meantime? No. Nobody helps me. Now, whatever could have caused that? Hey... What do think of this brooch? Not bad. If you show me the way to Mother Frost, I’ll give it to you. - You could really steal the show with it. - Bah! I don’t need that at all. My wife loves me the way I am. Shake me and rattle me! All my apples are juicy and ripe! Again work? Marie didn’t tell me anything about this. You want them to fall on my head? Absolutely not. But then they will all rot. Are those my apples? I’m in a hurry, I’m on my way to Mother Frost. Everything will come back to you – good things and bad things; back luck and good luck. It will all come back to you. Well, have you found Mother Frost already? Who are you? The caterpillar from before, whom you found so ugly. Oh, right. Does Mother Frost live up there? Hello, Louise. Nice that you’re here. Our meal is just ready. And once again the villagers were searching for seven days and seven nights in vain. And they couldn’t explain what had happened to Louise. Only Marie had her theories. Perhaps she jumped into the well. What? And? How did it taste, Louise? As usual. Could I clear up later on? You’d better do it now. Then you won’t have to think about it, later. All I do is work! My dress is full of stains! And when do I finally get a new one? I don’t think that’s necessary. You only need this apron which I knitted for you. Then... Oh, I’m not going to wear this stupid apron! I’m not some maid! Hello, Marie! Do you want to tell me something, Gustav? Instead of watering the flowers, she’s lying around idly. If you’re asking me – wasted affection. Let’s give her a bit more time. How long, then? Winter is about to arrive. Sebastian, it seems we’ll have a Christmas without snow. Yes, unfortunately. There! It’s snowing! Look! Snow! - Fortunately! - Oh, it’s snowing! It’s about time. Come, let’s build a snow man. Yes! And how long do I have to keep shaking it? But you just started. Master Frost reigns the land. And the plants and trees need a lot of snow for cover. But my arms are so tired already. You can keep it up for a little while longer. The children have been gazing at the sky for days now, and are waiting for it finally to begin to snow. Do you want to disappoint them? What do I care? Could it be? It’s stopping already. What a strange winter. Wasted affection. Come, Marie. We need to cover the plants with straw against the frost. We cannot wait for snow any longer. Yes, we won’t be having any more snow, this winter. Give her what she deserves and finally send her back home! Isn’t that too harsh? Everyone gets what they deserve. Louise... You can go home, now. I don’t need your help anymore. Hah! What help? Finally! And where is the gate? And my spindle? Here. But this one isn’t made out of gold. Ah, I know! It’s part of the reward for going through the gate. Right? Yes. When you go through the gate, you’ll become what you deserve, Louise. But remember – every day can be a new start. It all depends on you. Cock a doodle doo! Cock a doodle doo! The soiled maiden has returned to you! Oh, dear... Is that Louise? Louise? Just look at the state of her! It’s horrible! - You went to see Mother Frost? - Yes! I have scrubbed, I have watered the plants, fluffed up the beds... But it didn’t snow at all, last winter. I did what I could. And what is my thanks? I didn’t even get a golden spindle. Here. Comb your hair, and... And here... Put on my golden dress. Then you’ll look quite differently. Frieder! Would you like to dance with me? No, I’m sorry. I have to help my father. Everything comes back to you – good things and bad things; back luck and good luck. It will all come back to you. Nobody likes me. Every day can be a new start. It all depends on you. It all depends on you. Don’t move, butterfly. Otherwise I cannot help you. Did you get hurt, Struppi? Come. Come here. Calm down, I won’t hurt you. Come, Struppi. Come, come. You poor thing. Yes... aww... You stepped into a thorn. I’ll be over soon. You see? I’ve got it. Struppi, wait! Struppi, wait! Louise, wait! I’m glad you came after all. The dress looks good on you. - Much better than before. - Thanks. Here, your brooch. I’m sorry I took it from you. Thank you. I’m giving it to you. It looks better on you than on me. I already have Father’s necklace. Thank you very much. Would you like to dance, Louise? Yes, with pleasure. Well then, come! And from then on, Louise never forgot how good it felt to be kind and helpful towards others. And so she, her mother, Marie, and the villagers, lived happily and content until the end of their days.
