'TWO ACRES OF LAND' It hasn't rained for two years. The land is parched. The leaves on the trees have withered away. There's no sign of clouds in the sky. There was a turmoil in the country. But all sorrows do come to an end. The sky roars once again. Father! O father... Hey son! Parvati... Come and see the clouds. After so long, God has shown us mercy. I offered flowers to the Gods in the temple. So you brought the clouds. Look how dark they are. It will rain for sure.

I don't feel hungry any more. Thank God for His kindness. Our worries are over. Stand in the rain, Paro. It'll make you so happy. I'm not interested, you go... All right, then, don't get wet if you don't want to. Give me the towel, I'll dry myself off. "The Earth calls out to you" "Sow seeds of love" "The season is passing us by" "The season is passing us by" How is the soil now, Shambhu? It's fertile, alive, as though it's talking to me. It's thanks to my wife who prayed to the Gods. You owe us a treat. What about my wife, who offered her blood? I am glad that I'm unmarried. Who knows what my wife would have offered! If you were married, we wouldn't need rain at all. Your wife's tears would have flooded the land. It's been so long since God showed his mercy. These last two years have been so hard, Paro. If we have a good harvest, I'll take back your anklets from Nathuram. When you bring me lunch, I'll hear the anklets tinkling from afar. I'm too old to wear anklets. - You're too old? - Of course I am. Open your mouth. Let's see how many teeth you've lost. I can see a string of pearls. Old my foot! If I'm not old, then why don't you love me? I don't love you? Father! You've run away from school? - School's over. - How come? The teacher lost his cow and he's looking for it. Go and help him find it, then. - Who says I don't love you? Oh, I see! - Tulsi... Let me show you... Hey, Shambhu's been married for ten years at least. And he still sits there talking to his wife, I don't understand it. How could you? You only know how to beat your wife. That's nonsense. Come on, we've got a lot of work to do. Come. Good. An ideal situation. - Let's talk in your splendid house. - You're welcome. Come. Why is the landlord here? I saw his car a few times. The men with the landlord looked like city men. Then Jadhav was right. The landlord wants to build a mill here. That means we'll have to stop farming. Brother, this land belongs to the landlord. He can do as he pleases. The landlord doesn't own the whole land. Shambhu owns two acres. And if he doesn't sell, the mill can't be built. Will you sell your land, Shambhu? Have you gone mad? I'll never sell my land. He won't sell? Like hell he won't! He has no choice. I have him in my grip. Peasants are not what they used to be. He'll refuse to sell and you'll be left with nothing but your grip. Not at all. He is in my grip. I'll sort it out right now. Make sure you do that. Without his land, our plans for a mill will come to nothing. We've already printed the prospectus. 'The Great People's Mill Ltd.' Our chairman is Mr. Thakur Harnam Singh. We're all ready to go, sir. But we need that land. That's the least of my worries. The problem is the amount of money you're asking me to invest. Times are hard. But Thakur sir, money begets money. The government will end the feudal system. So why not invest in the industry? Goddess Lakshmi will bring us wealth. The village will become a city. Every home will have power, spinning fans. We'll entertain city folk. Nayab, will these people dance? Will you excuse us, Thakur sir? We've taken so much of your time. There's no reward without effort. We've travelled from the city for his benefit. Excuse us, Thakur sir. Bye. Nayab (Accountant). Yes, master? - How much does Shambhu owe us? - I'll have to check the ledger. - Check it and call him tomorrow. - Very well, sir. - Is the master in? - Yes. Master? Who is it? Shambhu? Yes, yes, sit down. - Nayab, bring the accounts. - Yes, sir. - I have good news for you. - Good news, master? I've decided to change the face of the village. I'll build a mill, proper roads. Every home will have electricity. Good for everyone. You're like our parent to us. If you don't help us, who will? You people don't understand. But you're the most sensible. Put your thumbprint here. What is it, master? Nothing. You know your two acres of land are adjacent to my land. I need that land, that's where the mill will be. Your thumbprint. In exchange, I'll waive your loan. I'll pay you back in full. Just give me more time. Taking advantage of my needs? Okay, I'll waive the loan and give you some money. The land is a farmer's mother. How can I sell? Once the mill is built, the land will become your father. You get nothing from the land. Work in the mill and you won't go hungry. If you uproot a tree and replant it in gold, will it survive? Enough talking. I'm thinking of your interests. Your thumbprint. I won't sell the land, master. What? How dare you? - You won't sell? - No. Don't listen to me, but don't bring about your own ruin. A farmer's life is ruined without his land. For seven generations, our home stood on that land. I will not sell it under any circumstances. How dare you? Such audacity! Very well. Then pay what you owe me by tomorrow. Tomorrow? Give me four days, master. - I've been too lenient. You people don't have any decency. - Do me a favour sir... - My mind's made up. Get out. - Have mercy, master. Master... Pour some water. - How long before the mangoes grow? - Five years. Grandad, I'll give the first mango to you and the second to father. Look, father. We've planted a mango tree. In five years we'll have fruit. Five years... Go, child. Get your slate and chalk. - Father, I need some urgent advice. - What is it, son? - I'll have to repay the landlord all our dues by tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yes, else our land will be auctioned. Auctioned! This is a crime. All we have is this plot of land. If we lose it, we'll starve. What do you think? I can't think of anything, father. But we must do something. - Here I am. - You came, son. - You know how to count, don't you? Add this up. - Yes. Two year's worth of grain seeds at Rs. 20. Rs. 20. Manure for three years, Rs. 12. Two bundles of hay at Rs. 8 each. - Slowly, father. I'll get it all mixed up. - All right. 8 plus 8, is 16. - 16 plus 12 is 28. Yes. - 28. I borrowed some cash. - Rs. 3, then Rs. 7, then Rs. 2. - 3, 7, 2. Interest on that? At most, Rs. 5. Write Rs. 5. What's that total? - Add it correctly, make no mistake. - Yes. 7... 4 plus 2 is 6. It's Rs. 65 in total. Rs. 65? Where can we get that in one go? I'll sell everything in the house. We must save the land. What are you doing with those utensils? Repaying the landlord. There was a pot here. Oh, here it is. What's going on? I must sell everything to repay the loan. We've lost everything, that's all we have left. Do as you please. - Paro, listen. - What is it? - We'll get nothing for this. - What can I do? You can sell me. My God, how angry you get! Would anyone dare buy you? - Stop teasing me, then. What do you want? - Paro. Go on, tell me. How can I say it? I've never bought you anything... - You want the earrings that my father gave me? - No! I get it. - No, Paro. You'll feel bad. - What do you care how I feel? You think it doesn't hurt me? But what can I do? If we can save the land, we'll be fine, right? Master, I've come to repay the loan. But I could never repay your kindness. I owe you Rs. 65. Nayab, check the ledger and tell me what he owes. Sir, according to the ledger, with the grain, the seeds, tax, manure, cash, others... his account now totals Rs. 235.50. Nayab, these can't be my accounts. Please check. Maybe I made a mistake. You are Shambu Maheto, aren't you? Yes. Shambhu, Shambhu Meheto. Then they're yours. Explain it to him. He mustn't think I'm cheating him. Oh! God! A pious man like you! Look. Isn't this your thumbprint? During the famine, you borrowed 5 kg of rice at Rs. 20 a kilo. Don't count that. But my father worked in master's garden for a year without pay. Didn't that pay for the rice? And who paid for all the meals his father ate here during the famine? Master, this will ruin me. Give me some more time. I'll replay every penny. Have mercy on me, master. I beg you. Now you beg for mercy. Yesterday you boasted you wouldn't sell the land. Master! Enough! Now we'll talk in court. Order. Order. Believe me, I only owe Rs. 65. Just answer the question. Did you take 5 kg of rice at Rs. 20 a kilo on loan? But my father... I'm not asking about your father. Did you pay for the rice? No, sir. Do you owe three year's land tax? Only one, sir. I've paid the tax for two years. - Any receipts? - Nayab didn't give me any. Any other proof? Any witnesses? Witnesses? There are no witnesses, sir. - God is my witness. - Then ask Him to stand here. Order. Order. This is a point, Your Honour. So 5 kg of rice... seeds, land tax, hay and 50 in cash. - How much in total? - Rs. 65, sir. I am absolutely right, sir. Have mercy, sir. - Order. Order. - Sir. 'The case of Harnam Singh, son of Johar Singh...' '...versus Shambhu Maheto, son of Gangu Maheto.' 'The plaintiff has requested...' '...that in repayment of the loan of Rs. 235.50 owed to him, ' Shambhu Maheto's land be confiscated. This court denies this request. However, Shambhu Maheto has no evidence to disprove the claim. 'So the court has decreed that Shambhu Maheto must repay the loan.' 'In view of his financial situation, the court grants him three months.' 'If in that time, Shambhu Maheto does not repay the loan in full...' '...Harnam Singh is entitled to auction the land.' How can I pay the money in so little time? I have an old father and a young child. We'll starve to death. All we have is the land. Sir! I brought some food. Eat it. I won't eat. Please eat. I beg you. You can't survive without eating. You haven't touched your food for two days. You're strong. Don't worry so much. What else can I do? I'm a poor farmer. In life I've never even seen Rs. 50. How can I find Rs. 235? We'll figure it out. Now eat. No, Paro. I won't be able to swallow it. Go home. I have to do something. Where were you, Shambhu? Out in this scorching sun. I've just lit the smoke. Want a puff? - I'm too worried. - Come here. Ill fated is the man who refuses a full smoke and a full meal. - Ill fated? Yes, I am. - Take it. I've been trying to get a loan. But I can't get a penny to repay the loan. I went to see the moneylender at Chandanpur. The first thing he said was, do I have any collateral? What collateral? What have I got left? You tell me. The utensils in the house paid for the court fees. I pleaded... but he didn't budge. That fellow's made of stone. He thrives on our misery. Oh yes. - I forgot to tell you. My son-in-law is back from Calcutta. Yes. - He's back? Yes, people go to the city and change completely. Who'd guess he's my son-in-law? He wears a long coat, and a belt around his waist. He has been given a uniform at work. Where does he work? You know, in Calcutta there's a big British Hotel. - He works there as a boy. - Boy? What work is that? Must be something. Who knows? Yesterday he was telling me that in Calcutta, money flies in the wind. Catch the flying notes, fill your pockets. Why not try your luck in Calcutta? How can I? I don't know anyone there. Once you go there, you'll meet people. If you sit here for three months, you'll never get the money. Why, what are you thinking? You might be right, uncle. Let me take my father's advice. Okay. There's no way I can find the money here. I should try in the city. What do you think? What can I say, son? I can't think. The main thing is to save the land. - Do what you think is right. - I've no choice, father. I should go to Calcutta tomorrow. Calcutta? Think it over, son. What will you do in the city? Where will you stay? You know no one. I'll meet people when I get there. Don't worry, let me go. - Where are you going? - Calcutta. Calcutta? You have to go there by train. - Right, grandpa? - Yes, dear. I want to go with you. I've never been on a train. You can't. I've nowhere to stay. Father. I want to go with you. If you go, who'll look after your mother? You will. I'm not old enough, anyway. Then you can't go to the city. Look how tall I am. Father, let me go with you. Don't pester me or I'll give you a hiding. Go! - You're going to Calcutta? - Yes, Paro. No, don't go. Many women work here. I could find work. Enough. No bride in our house has ever worked. Why should you? I'll be away for a few days. They'll pass by. No, I won't let you go. The city is not a good place. You'll forget me there. Oh, is that it? Crazy girl. With a lovely fairy like you, would I look at another? Just think, Paro. We've never been apart for ten years. What can I do? I have no choice. - Can I tell you something? - What? - Really? When? - There's time. - A boy or a girl? - Bravo! How do I know? Then I must go, whether it's a boy or a girl. I won't let a child of mine see his father begging in the streets. - Father! - I'm coming, son. I'm going, father. Look after the house. I've told Ramzan, to do the farming. - What time does the train leave? - 9 o'clock. Then don't be late. Take the name of Lord Rama and go. Bless me, father. May God be with you. - Let us know when you arrive. - Of course. You don't look well. Look after yourself, Paro. Where is the boy? I haven't seen him. He knows you were leaving. I don't know where he is. I scolded him a lot yesterday. Maybe he's upset. I wanted to see him before I leave. - Okay, I'd better go now. - Wait. - Come back soon. - Three months will pass quickly. Let me walk with you. Go home, Paro. You're not well, look after yourself. Are you crying again? Lots of people go to Calcutta. I don't know why, but I have the feeling I won't see you again. No, Paro, you're making me cry. Wipe your tears. Go home, else I won't be able to leave.

To kill bed bugs. 2 annas, 4 annas, 8 annas, Rs. 1. I have four kinds. Take the one you want. Or you may regret it later. This... Give me one, brother. What are you doing here, son? I'm here but don't be angry with me, father. I asked Ramu to tell mother I was leaving. So that's all right, is it? She must be sick with worry. I can't find Kanhaiya anywhere. What can I do? - Have you asked the neighbours? - I've been everywhere. I'll ask at the school. Aunty, Kanhaiya has gone to Calcutta with his father. He met me at the station and asked me to let you know. - Damn! - Father! That's all we need, another problem. What will poor Shambhu do? Work hard or look after the boy? In an unknown city. Look, father. What's that? What do you think this is? Your back garden? Get out of the way. He's wearing a shirt made of newspaper. Won't it tear if it rains? You're right The city is a strange place. Come. - Any work, brother? - What? Do you have any work? Here we sell 'Kachoris' and 'Samosas'. Try the shop across the road. What did you say? Which shop? How long have you been in Calcutta? - I've just arrived. - I can tell. Go away. Came here for work! Work! Son, come! - Where can I get work, sir? - What? - I'm a poor man. I'm looking for work. - Off you go. Look, father. That two-storey house is moving. Yes. Let's go. I can't walk any more, father. - Let's sit here and get our breath back. - Okay. Come. What a city, this Calcutta! No one even bothers to answer you. We'll go back tomorrow. Yes, father. The village is better. Grandpa and mother are there... Be quiet. I'm in worse trouble because of you. What can I do? I don't know which way to turn. What's the matter? You're hungry? Want something to eat? You sit here. I'll try to get something to eat. Wait here. Don't move till I get back. - What are you staring at? - Nothing. Nothing? You want to pick someone's pocket? Why would I do that? It's a very bad thing. Noble Yudhishthira. - Wow! - My name is not Yudhishthira, it's Kanhaiya. Kanhaiya? What, like Lord Krishna? Where do you live? In the village. I came here today with my father. - What's your name? - Laloo. Laloo Ustaad. So Laloo... - Not Laloo, 'Laloo Ustaad.' - Yes, Laloo Ustaad. - Where do you live? - Me? Grant Hotel. - Where is that? - See that big house over there? Such a big house? Isn't it scary? Who lives there with you? The usual. A few beggars, a few coolies and a flea infested dog. And sometimes, a couple of cows wander in. You don't get it, do you? We sleep on the footpath outside the Grand Hotel. If you have nowhere to stay, you can come too. Kannhaiya. Here, eat. Where's my bundle? Wake up, we've been robbed. Someone's stolen my bundle. The jug's gone too, father. There is no one here. This city... you don't give us anything and take it all away. What can I do? All my money was in that bundle. Now we can't even go back. Hey! - What are you doing here at this hour? - Sir... We've been robbed, everything was stolen. We arrived today from the village. We had nowhere to sleep. You can't sleep here. Go away. Where can we go? We don't know the city. Go anywhere but you can't stay here. Lord Ram! Where will we go? Let's go to the Grand Hotel, father. Where is that? See that white house? That's where it is. I've a friend who lives there. - Come on, father. Let's go. - Friend! That's my friend, father. Hey, Ustaad Laloo. Ustaad. - What is it? - It's me, Kanhaiya. - Kanhaiya? - Yes. Oh Kanhaiya! Go to sleep. This land belongs to us. Come. Father. Don't worry about him. He used to work in a mill and he lost his leg. Sometimes he dreams his leg has been caught in the wheel. Poor fellow. Hot tea. Hot tea. Long live Goddess Kali. One tea, brother. Son, hey Son. Wake up, son. Son, hey son. Your body is burning. How did you manage to get a fever? Oh, God! What am I to do? Hot tea would be good for you. - But I don't have any money. - I have two annas, father. Give it to me. Sit up. Stay here. I'll bring you some tea. Tea seller, give me tea for 4 paisa. We've just arrived from the village and the boy has a fever. We have nowhere to stay. Can you tell me of a place? Where do you live? In Lala Babu's colony. - Can we stay there, too? - Possibly. Where is Lala Babu's colony? Go straight ahead and then turn left. Then take another two steps and ask anyone where it is. God bless you, brother. "I'm deeply in love with devotion." Hello, brother! - Greetings sir. - Isn't the teashop open yet? - It won't be long. - Okay. - Listen brother. - Yes. Where is Lala Babu's colony? Carry on to Chatterjee Lane, then ask there. "Hail Lord Shiva." See that? She's filling up dozens of buckets. What about us? Hey, girl, move that bucket. Leave it, or I'll call grandma. - And what will she do? - I'll show you. - Grandma! O grandma! - This tap doesn't belong to you. - Shut up. - Don't try to stop me, okay. - Leave me. - What's going on here? Look, grandma. Shampa's pushing my bucket away. How dare you touch the bucket? I'll throw your bucket away. Yes, sure. Let me see. - You want to see that? - Yes. I'll beat you really hard. I'm not afraid of you. - Listen brother. - Yes. - Hit me. - Shut up. - Is this Lala's colony? - Yes. - Where is the master? - You mean the mistress? She's the boss around here. There she is. That white, run. This time I threw the bucket. Next time I'll throw you out. Don't you know who I am? Come on, let's go. See how they trouble us. What's this? What do you want? - Maybe they don't understand Bengali. - Oh! Where did you come from? - Can we stay here? - There's no room. I am in great trouble. My son has a fever. What can I do? There's no room. Granny, that carpenter's room is still empty. Let them have it. You mind your own business. Look, we have an empty room. It's 6 annas a day. You pay seven days in advance. Oh dear! You don't understand English either? You have to pay a deposit. And listen... If you don't pay, after three days... I'll throw you out. The deposit. - I have no money. - No money? Then get lost. Come here, you idiot. You're going away in a huff. You'll make this boy walk in the scorching sun and kill him? You don't have a penny and no brain either. Come with me. Come. This is your room. Where is your bedding? - Everything was stolen. - That's what they all say. And where will this boy sleep? Must I give you the bedding too? What a fellow! - Hey, Rani. Bring a mat. - Okay. - Now don't you run off with the mat! - No, not at all. Yes. - Listen, I must get the rent by this evening. - Okay. You can't breathe without money in this city. Come, son. Lie down. I'll go and find work. - You won't be scared alone? - No! All right! - Come back soon, father. - Yes. Hey, don't use your stove here. - Where, then? - In your room. - I pay the rent... - Get out of here... Stop fighting amongst yourselves. What is it? Why are you crying? Don't mind what grandma says. She shouts a lot but she's kind-hearted. She's not my real grandma. I'm from Bihar, we live in Chhapra. I lost all my family in the plague. She took me in and raised me as her daughter. You're exactly like my brother who died. That's why I asked granny to give you this room. You're very good, Rani. Coolie. Coolie. Coolie. - I'll carry your box, sir. - Go ahead.

What is it grandma? Throw his things out. Today I've made delicious 'Kulfis.' You want to try some? I'm not falling for that one. Get out of here. - Okay, okay. - Hey, listen. - Remember, if you don't pay tonight... - Okay. Okay. Buy 'Kulfi'... Here's the rent. Are you a father or a butcher? You've been out all day getting this money. How is my son? Never mind. Don't pretend to be his doting mother. Come, Rani. - Son? Son? - Father! - How are you, son? - My fever's gone down, father. Thank God! Water, water. Here. May God bless you. Please light the lamp. - How late is it? - Almost dawn. - Who are you? - I came yesterday. - I'm in the next room. - Oh! - I've had a burning fever since last night. - You'll be all right, brother. Brother. - Will you do me a favour? - What? - My rickshaw, the hand rickshaw. - Rickshaw? It's parked nearby. Take it to its owner. If he doesn't get it back before dawn, he'll charge me another day. I don't know the roads. Just ask anyone at the main road... how to get to Nandi sir's rickshaw depot. - Nandi sir's rickshaw depot? - Yes. Very well, brother. I'll get it there. But look, you don't have a rickshaw license, so don't get caught by the police. - Okay. - Okay. Yes... - Hey, rickshaw! Wait. - Sorry, it's not for hire. What nonsense! Come here! - No sir. - What nonsense? You take me to the station or I'll call the police. Come on, put it down. Stop there. How can I get down? You must be new. - Got any change? No? - No I don't. Take this. 8 annas? - Here's your 8 annas. - Money? What money? A man said he'd call the police if I didn't take him to the station. He gave me this. O Lord, thank God for this money. Being ill, I couldn't earn anything yesterday. You know how it is, living from day to day. I was so worried. Don't worry, brother. I'll look after you. - Teach me how to run a rickshaw. - It's a lot of hard work. It doesn't matter. I must earn Rs. 235 in two and a half months... or my land will be seized. Teach me and help me get a license. Getting a license is not easy. Never mind. Let me get better and I'll teach you everything. Stop! What are you doing? You'll topple the rickshaw. You told me to stop. - Yes, but you slow down first. Go to the pavement, then stop. - Oh. Try again. You'll be fine. Well done. You know it now. This is fun, father. Can you go faster? Faster, faster! "With every monk, every penny leaves every pains." - What's my name, Rani? - Don't you know your own name? - You say it. - Why? Preetam. - One more time. - Preetam! Take two lemon juice (Toffees). Lover boy, go away. Stop teasing Rani. Father is back! Here, try this, son. - How was it today, Shambhu? - Good. I paid the owner and had one and a half rupees left. The boy had no clothes, so I bought him a vest. You did well. Let me see it. Excellent! You look good. Exactly like a prince. Which prince has shown up here? Look, grandma. Kanhaiya looks like a prince. Don't be silly. A rickshaw driver's son looking like a prince? You've got new clothes on, pay your respects to your father. It's okay. - Count this money and put it away safely. - Okay father. I must watch every penny. You are right. Daughter-in-law, your fever never leaves you... and yet you wade into the water for chestnuts. What can I do, father? We must eat something. We poor have nothing at all. If only we didn't have this wretched stomach... - Is Gangu Maheto at home? - Who is it? Who else but that shameless Nayab? Because of this fool, women can't move around in peace. When he sees me, he ogles me. And now he shows up here. You talk to him outside, father. Is no one around? I can't hear anything. Oh, here you are. I was passing. I thought I'd say hello. - What's wrong? Aren't you going to offer me a seat? - Oh, yes... Daughter-in-law, bring a mat. How are things, Gangu? What do you expect, sir? - Is that Shambhu's wife? - Yes, sir. Look how pale she is now. Oh dear! How beautiful she was once! She's plagued with fever. She's had nothing to eat or drink. Why not? Doesn't Shambhu send money from Calcutta? He's been gone for three weeks. We haven't had one letter. Not one letter? I hear he's having a great time there. And he doesn't write home? - Is Shambhu all right? - He's more than all right. My nephew was in Calcutta. He met Shambhu in the street. Shambhu saw him and turned away. He didn't talk to him. Living in the city does that to you. Shambhu has gone astray. But while I'm here, you needn't worry. Send your daughter-in-law to me. I'll give her wheat and rice. And medicine for her fever. I must go elsewhere now. Send her to me this evening. I was so upset to hear about Shambhu. Hail Lord. Well, I must be off. Daughter-in-law... Did you hear what he said about Shambhu? No, father, it's impossible. He's lying. I hope you're right. I hope to God you're right. - Rickshaw driver, our school finishes at 4. Be on time. - Okay. - Don't be late. I get very hungry. - I won't be late. Laloo Ustaad! Kanhaiya, you fool. I'm off to work and you stopped me. - Where are you going? - Baghdad. I mean the Baghdad Cinema. To see the star Ranjan wielding his sword. - Does he kill people? - Yeah. Coming? - I'll treat you. My pockets are burning, just made Rs. 2. - Rs. 2. - How did you get so much? - Shining shoes. Today I had a real gentleman. He was amazed at the way I polished his shoes. He shakes hands and says, "Very good, first class" in English. And put Rs. 2 in my hand. - Rs. 2! - Yes. You're still at the same place? Not there, you fool. Now I hang around fancy Park Street. Okay, bye. Hot Chickpea. What's the matter, son? Uncle, will you make me a box? - What kind of box? - To shine shoes. What for? So I can work like you and father. I'm all grown up now. I can earn to lessen father's burden. Well done! The worthy son of a worthy man. I'll make you a box. It's late now, I'll make it tomorrow. Okay. But don't tell father. When I earn lots of money, I'll surprise him. - Okay. - Okay. Poverty! Worrying about money in childhood. - It will look like a proper box? - Absolutely. I was trying to have a nap in this heat and you started the tapping! Oh, the old man is at it too. It's okay, grandma. I'm making a toy for the boy. Talking in Bengali won't appease me. We were making a rickshaw for you. But it's too small, we'll need a lorry. Making fun of me? Wait a minute. You get lost, Rani. - And you, stop all this. - I am stopping. - Son, do you know how to get clients? - Yes, of course. - How will you do it? - Like this. Come here, sir. Boot polish. Top shoe-shine. Your shoes will shine and come alive. Come here, sir. Top class! - Top class! First class! - Sir... - Come sir... - Please... How much do you charge? - 2 annas. I won't overcharge. - No, 1 anna. 1 anna? No shoeshine, but I'll shine your foot. Hey, Kanhaiya! You look good. Come and join our union. - Polish. Polish. - Come here, sir. You can't just give shine to any shoe. You know nothing yet. Pass me your black polish. Here's six-paisa for you and two for me. No way, you did all the work. Want a slap? Here. You thought I'd stolen your customer? You're so naive. That man was wearing socks. If you had polished on them, he would've kicked you. Polish? - I've run out of black polish. He does a first-class shoeshine. - Yes sir. Kanhaiya, go ahead. Sir, polish? "Visiting Calcutta" "Don't leave without a shoeshine, mister" "Don't leave" Isn't Kanhaiya back yet? No. If his father gets back before him, he'll be upset. He doesn't know the way. I hope he doesn't get lost. What if we do not find him? Come, Shambhu. How was your day? Not good. I've been slaving for three weeks and made less than Rs. 50. I don't know what will happen. The room is locked? Where is the boy? He was around just now. Wasn't he playing with you? Yes, we both were... So where is he? - I hope he hasn't gone to the main road. I'll have a look. - No... You're tired. Here's your room key. I'll go look for him. Where were you? Your father's been back for ages. Any luck? Yes, uncle. I earned 12 annas and bought two red bangles for mother. - Good boy! Show him the money and surprise him, go. - Okay. - Father! - Where were you? I've told you never to go out of the house. Come here. What's this? Money? Bangles? I sweat blood to earn money and you waste it. Shambhu, you hit the boy? - He stole my money. - Quiet! Apologise to him and beg for his forgiveness. He's been working in the hot sun all day, and you... - Worked? - Yes. Look, he started shining shoes. You called him a thief and hit him. You don't know your own son, Shambhu? Son... Hit me, son. Hit me - Hit me! - No father. My sweet boy. - Did I hurt you, son? - No, father. We'll have no more worries now. No more worries. My son has started earning. Tomorrow we'll send all the money to your mother... and tell her that your son has started working. Yes, your son. My son, our son. Is Gangu Maheto at home? There's a money order in your name. Money? Who sends it? Shambhu Maheto. Shambhu? - Paro, there's news from Shambhu. - Father. Who is it? No one. He's sent us some money. Is there a letter? How is he? How's my Kanhaiya? No letter. A few words on the coupon. What does it say, can you read it? We can't read. 'Father, I'm sending you Rs. 48 and 8 annas.' 'I'll send you money every fortnight. Keep it safely.' 'We're both well. Here's the address, send us a letter. Shambhu.' 'Then it's written...' 'Kanhaiya's earnings are included in this amount'. Father, did you hear? Yes, daughter. Kanhaiya's earning money too. May God give them a long life. Child, keep this money in a safe place. Father, your cough is not getting better but worse. You need some medicine. I'll use some of the money to buy you... Never! Don't touch that money. I'm an old man. I can't earn any money. Don't increase my grief by spending money on me. Okay father. Mishra's daughter-in-law wants some water chestnuts. If she pays me, I'll get you some medicine. "Come, o sweet sleep" "Come, o sweet sleep" "Come, o sweet sleep" "Descend from the twinkling stars" "And fill our eyes with lovely dreams" "Come, o sweet sleep" "The buds are asleep, the garden is asleep" "The breeze under the fig tree is asleep" "You have made this world full of colour" "What is this magic you weave?" "Come, o sweet sleep" "You are the queen of the world" "You are my cherished one" "The entire world lies in my lap" "All my dreams have been fulfilled" "Come, o sweet sleep" "Come, o sweet sleep" How long have you been sitting here? I didn't want to stop your song, so I sat here and listened. You have such a lovely voice. God must have poured the sweetness of the world into your throat. - What have you brought? - You wanted some water chestnuts. I'll get your money. I want a favour. - Can you write a letter for me? - To whom? Tell me. To your husband? Don't be shy. Everyone writes to their husbands. I'll get paper and pen. What shall I write? Oh God! How can I tell you? I've never written a letter. - Write what you think is correct. - Shut up! How do I know what you want to say to your husband? You tell me. Tell him I got the money. But how do I start? What do you call him? You don't call a husband by his name. Why not? Everyone does. What do you call him? - Tell me. - His boy's father. You can't call him that in a letter. Think of some other name. I'm too shy. Write whatever you like. All right. 'My lord and husband...' Then what? 'We have received the money'. 'Father's fever has come down lately.' 'We still need a lot of money. Who knows what will happen?' And then add... 'Write to me often'. 'Has my son forgotten his mother?' 'I'm longing to see him.' Father, a letter. Maybe it's from your mother. Read it. Okay father. 'My lord and husband...' - Who does she mean? - Never mind, read on. 'We have received the money.' 'Father's fever has come down lately.' 'We still need a lot of money. Who knows what will happen?' 'Write to me often.' 'Has my son forgotten his mother?' 'I'm longing to see him.' Don't cry, you silly boy. Only a few more days. We'll be home soon. Stop! 4 annas? 2 annas more. The rate is 4 annas. You had said, "Take three men and I'll give you another 2 annas". You owe me 2 annas. Give him his money, he's a scum. Yes, I'm a scum. Pay now. Great. What's wrong, brother? The streets are as hot as a pan on the fire. My feet have burned. Buy yourself some cloth shoes. - Shoes? How much do they cost? - Rs. 2.50. - No, I don't want any shoes. - Yes. I'll wrap rags around my feet. You're such a miser. You miser, you won't even buy an ice-cream. I don't want one. That's just him. Yesterday I said, "Let's see 'Awaara, ' starring the great Nargis". - He said, "I don't have money". - I love the song in that film. "I'm a vagabond" "I'm a vagabond" "Struck down by destiny or shining like a star" "I'm a vagabond" "I'm a vagabond" "Struck down by destiny..." Look at his shirt. She's undressing and the hero is watching. I want a shirt like that. - Sure, first cover the hole in your vest. - Shut up! Ricksha driver, we can't go with you. We'll walk. - Why, princesses? - Father's lost his job. - Be quiet. You can go riksha driver. - Oh riksha driver. You go inside. Don't come tomorrow, rickshaw driver. - You can collect your dues at the end of the month. - Okay sir. - Let's go. - Sorry, I have a customer. Hey, rickshaw! Sit down, princesses. - Our father can't pay you. - Who's asking you for money? - Sister, my foot hurts. - See? Her foot hurts. Come on... I'll pick you up at 4. Son? You're back, father? Take this. Count this and put it away. Then we'll go out and eat. Yes, father. I'm starving. - How much? - 1 rupee, 2 annas. Is that all? The children's job is gone. - How much did you earn? - 10 annas. Take this. Take this. You go out and eat. I don't feel well. I won't eat today. Go! You're back? My tummy aches. I don't want to eat either. My son, you understood. Son. But even if we starve, how much can we save? It's only a few days till the end of the month. We'll have to work harder, son. We must earn at least Rs. 4 a day, or we'll lose everything. - Son, can you earn one rupee a day? - Yes father. Somehow, I must earn at least Rs. 3 a day. I'll work day and night. Day and night. Sir... Hey, get up. Hurry. Bye. Bye. Milli, listen! Hey, you! Follow them, As fast as you can. Mili... Faster, faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. I'll give you Rs. 2. 2? 2. Faster, faster. - Faster. - Okay sir. Faster. 4. 5. 6. - 6? - Faster. Faster, faster. Uncle, it's late and father isn't back yet. Maybe he has a good customer. He'll be back. He's never that late. I'll go and look for him at the betel shop. Okay. - Ustaad, a packet of Gold Flakes. - Yes sir. Add it to my account. Father hasn't come home yet. Have you seen him? No! Make one 'Paan-Masala'. What's your name? I'm talking to you. What's your name? Kanhaiya? The little boss has a good name. - What do you do? - I polish shoes. God… Your change. - Cigarette? - I don't smoke. Coward! - Watch it. Don't call me a coward. - Hey, you've got guts. Why did you steal from that man? Why not? These gentlemen are my bank. - When I need cash, I take it. - Thief. The world's full of thieves. What does your father do? Oh, I was looking for him. I must go. Father! Father, what's happened to you? - Stop crying, we're all here. - Kanhaiya... He's hurt, but he'll be fine in a few days. - Father... - Hey son! The medicine. The doctor says he should stay in bed for two weeks. He's lost a lot of blood. He must eat properly. Rani, get him some milk. Don't cry son. Son! There's no milk. Make him drink this. There's no milk? You've been sitting here for ages. Allow me. No need. He's asleep now, let him rest. Come. - Who's there? - It's me. What are you doing? Taking some money. The doctor says you've lost a lot of blood. You should eat healthy food. Don't use a penny. Nothing's wrong with me. I'll be running the rickshaw soon. Son. Work as hard as you can, son. Don't waste a penny on anything. We have very little time left. Very little time. You're back again? Why come all this way every day? If a letter comes, I'll deliver it personally. We haven't heard any news for days... My Kanhaiya... Don't worry. As soon as a letter arrives, I'll bring it over. That's my job. O Lord, have pity on us. Paro? - It's so hot, where have you been? - Chandanpur. I'm sure you went to the post office. Any letter? No, nothing. You're killing yourself, going without food and running miles. Stop worrying so much. What can I do? I've not heard from him. We still owe Rs. 50 to the landlord. We have very few days left. What can I do? I'd be better off dead. You want to die? Think of your unborn child. I told you before, work with us. What's wrong with that? You'll get Rs. 1.50 a day. You can get food and save some money. Tell me. I could talk to the contractor now. Yes, sister, talk to him. I must do something. - The rest is up to God. - Let's go. - Why are you undoing the bandage? - I'm going out. Where? - I need to pull the rickshaw. - Don't go, father. Quiet! Rani. Hey Rani. Grandma, come here quickly. What happened? Father's going out with his rickshaw. Have you made a vow to die? Aunty, you know if I lie here we'll be ruined. - I must go. - No, Shambhu. Father... Good, now you'll listen. I've told you many times you can't go out. - Better dying than this. - Lie down. If you get up, I'll break the other leg. You little prince, you're strutting about in style. Your father's getting weaker by the day. Bring some fruit on the way back. Polish. Polish. 1 aana. Polish. Hey Kanhaiya? You're late. How's your father? Not well. The doctor says he must eat healthy food. But where can I get the money? Don't worry. Laloo Ustaad is here. Heard that? Kanhaiya's father is not well. We give him 2 paisa per customer, okay? - Why should I? - Income tax, you must pay. Hey, Kanhaiya! Why are you sitting there with a sad face? My shoe-shine box is broken. Forget that damn box. Come with me. Where? Today's the day of the race. Lots of rich people will come. Come on Final sheet, 4 annas each! Final sheet, 4 annas each! Final... Why did you run away? I don't know, I was scared. Coward. We were making good money, you ruined everything. Out with the loot. Let's see. All for show. Rs. 3 and 4 annas and he's strutting about it. Give me the pen. A fake Parker. What's wrong with today's rich people? They don't carry authentic goods. Here, you can get some some money for this. I don't want stolen things. Oh, the little saint! Never mind, give me the watch. Wow! I've hit the jackpot. It's pure gold. The betel shop will give you at least Rs. 300. - That's more than Rs. 235. - Yes, you fool. Can I ask you something? Give me Rs. 50. It takes you an hour to earn that. But my mother has to starve for Rs. 50. My father is near death. We will lose everything, our home and land. Please give me the money. Damn you! You just said you don't want stolen things. I'll never ask you again. With Rs. 50, we can go back to the village and repay the loan. I beg you, give me the money. Give me the money. Aren't you embarrassed, begging from a thief? Get lost. Even looking at a beggar like you is a sin. Why are you sulking? Okay, massage my feet. I'll give you Rs. 10. - Give me that watch. - Are you going to kill me? - Give me the watch. - No way. I won't spare you. All right, have it. I don't want it. I'm sorry. I went mad. Now you're crying like a little girl. Here, take it and run. But if you sell it, the police will catch you. Come with me to the betel shop. I'll get your Rs. 50. Take this. Now run. Look what I've brought for you, father. Medicine, oranges. - Who asked you to bring this? - The doctor said... I told you not to waste money needlessly. Look, I have the money. Now we can repay the loan. Where did you get this money? - Somewhere. Please, father, eat. - No... I won't eat until you tell me. - Who gave you this money? - A friend. What friend? What does he do? Tell me. Father, he... He's a pickpocket. A pickpocket? A pickpocket? You bring stolen goods to me? You're a farmer's son and you steal? You dishonest boy. A farmer's son. Son... If your mother hears of it, she'll die of shame. She'll die. Beat me as much as you like. But please eat, father. If you don't eat, you'll die. Better than living like this. My son, that's stealing... Pick up all this and throw it out. Give that money back, now. 'Mother, if you don't come, father will die, ' 'I've written the address. Come quickly, mother.' 'Come quickly.' What's the point of crying? Everyone falls ill. Bring your husband and son home. Will they come back? We still owe lots of money. Don't worry. I'll give you the money. You can return it gradually. People like you actually exist? I wouldn't believe it if I didn't know you. Sister, give me your blessings. So I can bring them home safely. Don't delay. - Take someone with you and go today. - Okay. Very well. I'll come and see you when I return. Father, I must go now. I'm going, father. - Father? - Yes. Oh no! You've got a high fever again. Yes, daughter-in-law. I'm freezing. Pass me the blanket. I can't leave you in this state. Don't worry about me. I've already got one foot in the grave. - Go, in the name of Lord Rama, no... - I can't leave you like this. Go, daughter-in-law. Bring them home. I'll feel better when I see them. - Is Chameli's son here? So don't delay. - Yes. You'll miss the train. All right, I'll go. I'll ask Chameli to look after you. Oh God! Oh God, bring them home safely. Aunty, can I get some water? No, we'll be off soon. Drink at the next station. I'm very thirsty. The tap is just across there. Don't be long. Ramu isn't back. What can I do? Ramu. Ramu. Sit down, or you'll be left behind too. Don't go, father. You're not well. There's only five days left. I must earn Rs. 50 before then... - But father, listen. - Let me go, son. Father... Don't go, father. I beg you. He won't listen to me, grandma. - Where is he going? - To pull the rickshaw. Pulling the rickshaw with this wounded leg? I have to. Listen to me. You'll kill yourself. Not even God can save you. Goddess Kali! Help me find Rs. 50... or my father will fall and die in the street. Just once, mother. I'll never do it again. Forgive me. Listen, brother. Tell me where this is. I've been looking for hours. My husband is ill. I've come from the village to see him. I don't live around here. Ask that betel shop person. Where do you want to go? Oh, Shambhu Maheto? Come with me. Who is he? My husband. Do you know him? Do I know him? He's my closest friend. We work in the same factory. - But he pulls a rickshaw. - Oh yes, he does... How is he? I swear to God, a lie never escapes my lips. The truth is he's not very well these days. Not enough money for a doctor. I've brought some money. Take me to him quickly. How far is it? Oh, very close. Come with me. Thief! Come along. We've come quite a way. How far more? We're nearly there. Where are we? Wait in there. I'll fetch the doctor. - We must find a good doctor. Then Shambhu will be saved. - Oh! No, I can't stay here alone. I'll go with you. Are you mad? If you're with me, the doctor will charge more. Sit down. I'll bring the doctor here in a jiffy. Rs. 100? What took you so long? Let's hurry. - Is the doctor with you? - No, he won't come. I swear, without money they don't even talk these days. I begged him, but he wouldn't listen. How much money have you got? I won't give it to you. You're a bad man. It didn't take you long to understand. Now that you've understood, tell me... how much money do you have? I won't give it to you. Let me go. So quickly? That's impossible. Let me go or I'll scream. No point doing that. You can scream at the top of your voice... no one will hear you. Bravo! What a pretty face. Why are you hiding it? You scoundrel! You sinner. Don't come near me. You look even prettier when you're angry. - Out with the money. - No! I beg you, don't take my money. It's earned with sweat and blood. My husband can't be saved without this money. Let me go. I beg you, no... Where are you going? She's badly hurt, her nose is bleeding. We must get her to the hospital. Get a taxi. No taxis here. I'll call a rickshaw. Call an ambulance too. Get some ice from the shop. Hey, come on. Rickshaw! - Rickshaw. Hey rickshaw. - Yes sir! A woman's been hit by a car, she'll die. If the blood stains my rickshaw, it'll cost you Rs. 5. Get lost. Sir, give me what you can. Hurry. Lift her. Hurry. Lift her. Paro! Open your eyes. Paro. Answer me Paro. Stop crying. Take her to the hospital quickly if you want to save her. - Move... - Paro... Pick her up! - Pick her up! - Pick her up... He's taken her to the hospital? Will she be all right? I don't know. Shambhu's asked for Kanhaiya. - Where is he? - He's not here. Father... Where's father? - Come with me, Kanhaiya. - Where? Has anything happened to my father? Tell me. He's all right. Your mother is here. - Mother is here? Where is she? - Come with me. Wait. I bought mother some red bangles, let me get them. Let's hurry. Father... Father, where's mother? I brought the red bangles with me. Where is mother? Tell me. Why are they taking her away? Your mother was hit by a car. Mother, you're dead. I stole money and you're dead. Mother... Don't you know why I stole it? I've killed my mother. Your mother is not dead, son. I know she's dead. Why don't you tell me? I stole money and she died. Look, mother. I'm tearing up the stolen money right now. Speak to me, mother I'll never steal again, never. Let me go. - I've killed mother, father. - Son... Don't cry, son. Don't cry, son. Paro, you were fated to die here. Be brave, Shambhu. Be patient. We found Rs. 60 on her. Give it to me. Who are the relatives of that ill fated woman? This is her husband. Will she be all right, doctor? She's unconscious, but there's hope. Doctor, save my mother. I beg you. Your mother will be fine. She needs an injection and a blood transfusion. The hospital cannot pay for the treatment. You'll have to pay for it. We sweated blood to earn money to save our land. And now I have to pay for blood? What should I do? But Paro will be saved. - Save my mother, father. - Of course, son. 'Shambhu Maheto didn't repay the loan.' 'He took his wife and child and ran away from here.' 'His old father, Gangu Maheto, has lost his mind.' 'Therefore, the court has no choice but to auction their land.' You'll auction the land? Go on, auction it. You throw us out of our home. So what? Our home was tiny. Now we have a huge mansion. The entire universe is our home now. That blue sky above us will serve as a roof. Look, mother. Where that smoke is rising from, that was our home. That's where my kitchen was. Let's go, mother. - Let's go, father. - Yes. Let's go. Hey, what have you picked up? Show me. Nothing, brother. You thief! Show me what you've stolen. Get away from here. "Oh brother"
