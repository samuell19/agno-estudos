I couldn't protect them. I got to do the only thing I can to end this. Please know... please know, I didn't... I didn't kill them. I loved... I loved my family. No... no! Ahh! This is some good stuff, huh? I mean, prison food was better than this. So I was thinking about picking up a bed tomorrow for the spare room. No, not necessary, seriously. You cannot sleep in the living room forever. I will not have it. The couch is fine, I've been sleeping on a lot worse. Marcus, you can stay here as long as you want. Thanks. And besides, I'm sure Dylan does not want someone snoring in his face when he's watching his man shows. Well, I didn't know TV shows about interior design were called man shows these days. Plus, I don't think Marcus really wants to live with his sister forever, right? Why not? We have the space. The spare room is just collecting dust anyway. Well, speaking of design, it might be a little too early, but I was thinking possibly of turning that room into our little nursery, hmm? - I'm not pregnant. - Well, not yet. We're not getting any younger, and this isn't exactly our first marriage. You know what, you're right. You guys have been really great, and I appreciate that, but I think it's time I look for a place of my own. Marcus. Shit. I'll be right back, guys. 11th Hour Cleaning. Hey, Dylan, are you available? How bad? Yeah, murder suicide. Father sliced up his two sons, wife, mother in law, turned the gun on himself. Shit. Yeah, it's some nasty shit. You might want to bring some extra people on this. Yeah, but the usual rush charges though. That's fine, I'll just text you the address. Just hurry up, all right? I'm moving right now. You better be calling to wish me a happy holiday. No, not tonight. Jesus, what is it? We just got a call. Are you available? Look, I'm really sorry to ask last minute, but... How long is it gonna take? Could be all night, but we'll cut you loose as soon as we can. Can't you ask Jorge or Travis? They're both out of town for the holidays. You're the only one that's available. Look, I'll give you rush pay. I promise, I'll throw you in a little extra just for the holidays. Fine, text me the address. You are a lifesaver. Would you stop staring at me? You're giving me the creeps. You know a bird could live in that thing. When are you gonna shave that beard? When I can grow hair on the top of my head. Okay, so never. No. You know, Mom, if she was around, she'd shave it in your sleep. Mom was never shy about making her feelings known, that's for sure. Nope. You know, the hospital staff literally had to hold her down 'cause she kept trying to leave to go visit you. Sorry you couldn't be there, Marcus. Yeah, me too. You know, I just... I wish she would have told us she was sick. She didn't want to burden anyone. That's what she told me, she hated when people felt sorry for her. And you know what, I don't blame her. Yeah, well, that was Mom, always protecting us. That's what mothers do. It's funny though, funny how many times that she would try and hide stuff from us, we would always find out eventually. Yeah. I guess we all have to face the music at some point or another, right? Hey, I just got a rush call. Five person murder suicide. Marcus. - Yeah? I could use your help on this one. - Yeah. - You in? Yeah, of course. - All right. - I'll load up the truck. Were you able to get anyone else? Yeah, just might be a problem. Hannah. She was the only one available. Shit. Well, we're just gonna have to make it work. I'm gonna go get ready. You know, my resume hit the bottom of the trash can so fast after they did background checks, you'd think it were tied to a brick. As long as you know this is temporary. I know. But the plan was is that I was going to get a job, put some money in the bank, and then I was gonna go get a place of my own. Look, ever since your mom passed away, Rachel's wanted to be more involved in your life. And I want to be a part of her life too. And that's fine, but your sister and I, we have our own problems to face. You okay, man? Yeah, I'm fine. Because if you need me to stay somewhere for the night, just let me know, and you'll have your privacy. I appreciate that, but I'd rather not have to ask you. Sit in the front. I'll go in the back. Are you sure? Yeah, positive. Did you tell him? Tell me what? What? All right, Hannah's been working for us as well. And she's working with us tonight. Okay. I know you guys had a rough breakup right before you went to... before you went away. Is that okay? It doesn't matter if it's okay with him, it's happening. It doesn't have to be a unilateral decision. We don't have time to be dancing around with this... It's fine, all right! I can work with her without making a scene. All right, I'll tell you what. We'll make sure that we keep you two separated. I'm here to work, all right? You don't have to worry about me. You're good. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. All right, we've got to get going. Rios is waiting for us. Surprised you're still here. Figured they'd have a uniform on post. Holidays, working all the overtime I can. Kids ain't cheap. Why is it always this time of the year? 'Tis the season, I guess. Don't you and Rachel want kids? I thought we did. Not sure now, though. Hey, I love mine. They're exhausting as shit though, 'cause compared to this, kids are a cakewalk. Shit. Rach, can I talk to you? Yeah. - Nice to see you too. - Marcus. Rachel, I know he's your brother, but I changed my mind. I'm sorry, but I'm not working with him. All right, I'll send the invoice tomorrow. Hannah, I know this is uncomfortable for you... Uncomfortable? This is an impossible situation. I'll call you if I have any problems. Go get some rest. Thanks, Rios. We tried to warn you. I'm sorry, really. But it's too late to back out now. What's going on? So is this gonna be permanent? Now, I really need you tonight. Just stay, and I promise you, I'll never schedule the two of you together again. Fine. Thank you. - Yeah. - All right, let's do this. Okay. Oh, Jesus, the smell. We got here early. Consider yourself lucky. Something to cleanup in there. All right, Marcus and I are gonna keep looking around. You two, start with this room, okay? Let's go. What did he do, slaughter them in their beds? Look at that spatter. How could anyone do that to their kid? Geez... That's a lot of blood. What's this? Marcus, you okay? Marcus? Yeah, what do you need me to do? Let's check out the other rooms, come on. What's this? Hmm, hey, what is all this? Huge collection, I wonder what it's worth. Put it back, Marcus. I said put it back. - Oh, hey, man, I wasn't... - Good, now put it back. Puttin' it back. There, happy? Come on, let's get supplies from the van. Don't touch anything else. Hey, Dylan. Listen man, if you think it's going to be a problem, me and Hannah working together, I don't gotta stay tonight. No, this is a big job, need you both. We'll just try to keep you two separated. And just remember, just keep it professional, okay? I'll do my best to stay out of her way. I appreciate that. I appreciate the work, man, thank you. Of course. All right, fill this up with water out back and meet me in the master bedroom. That's the third. Funny, it looked like a one-story from the street. It's a mother-in-law suite. Let's set up the safe zone here. That's four. Hey, don't be mad at Dylan. Hiring Marcus was my idea. It was just a really tough time, okay? And, like, the neighbors, people at the store... Look, everyone was judging me, you know? It took a long time to get to the point where life was normal. And I wasn't thinking about it every day, you know, and I get here today, and it's like having a Band-Aid ripped off again, having the same fucking nightmare as back then. Just know that he's different now. He's really trying. Look, Rach, I know you love him because he's your brother, but I can't anymore. Let's get to work upstairs. Hey, who's there? Marcus, keep it down, man. What's going on over there? I heard something in the bushes. Probably just a cat. Come on, let's go. All right, I'm gonna start you off with something easy, okay? So... Dab first, scrub in a circular motion. Let the cleaning solution do all the work. - That's it? - That's it. Oh, call if you need help, all right? Hannah? You all right? Yeah, I mean, no matter how many jobs like this we do, I still get creeped out. I got Marcus up to speed in the other room. Okay, I'll stay clear of him. All right, I'll be downstairs. If you need anything, let me know. Aye-aye, captain. Damn it. Hey, I found a phone... oh. What do you want, Marcus? Forget it, never mind. You know what? You know, you shouldn't have taken this job with Dylan and Rachel. You knew this was gonna happen. It was the only job that I could get with a felony record. Can you give me a break? What do you want from me? I want you to leave me alone, okay? I've moved on, so should you. You sure it doesn't feel like getting a Band-Aid ripped off? - Typical. - I did what I had to do. You, better than anyone else, should know that. Okay, look, I am sorry about the way things ended, okay, but it is over. So can we get back to work and get the hell out of here? - Hannah, can you just... - Go! Holiday pay for doing your job. He's trying to back out at the location, fucking ungrateful. Look at this mess. During the holidays. What the fuck? - Dylan? - Christ! You scared the shit out of me. It's burning up in here. Why don't you open up a window? I'm fine. It's so nice and cold outside. It's really hot upstairs too. Good insulation, I guess. It's an old house. I'm pretty sure they don't have insulation. What's the matter? Dylan, hello? Are you serious... will you at least look at me? Rach, you know the rule. You can't take off your mask in here! Okay, well, then talk to me. I couldn't say this in front of Marcus, and I definitely didn't want to have this conversation in here, but at home, I found a birth control box in the trash. Uh... I... Why did you lie to me? I want to have kids with you. I do. You're taking birth control, Rachel. I just... I don't know if I'm ready. And with the business growing? I mean, I didn't want to put any more pressure on us. You should have told me something. When would that be? At work? When we're in front of everybody? Or at home when you're asleep? You knew this was gonna take a while before I was gonna have more free time. You said that three years ago! When are we going to stop taking every single job? Well, maybe soon, you won't have to work at all. So you figured that I would stay at home alone while you cleaned up dead bodies for a living. You won't be alone. No, no, no, no, because if you need any help, you can ask your brother who's gonna be living on the couch. Now, can I please get back to work? Fuck you, Dylan. Hey... I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated and tired. We're all tired. That's no excuse to be an asshole. You're right. I apologize. It's this job, I'm... Something came over me. I'll try not to let it happen again. Are we good? Yeah, just give me a minute. Get out! I know it might be too late. There's something in this house. I don't know if I brought it in. I don't know if it was living here already. I don't know. I don't know. It took my family. It killed them, it killed them. It won't let me leave! It won't let me leave! Hey, Marcus, can you try and keep that phone stuff down to a minimum? It's not mine. If you're listening, run... run! What? This video just started playing all by itself. And he was just covered in blood. - Is the murder on that? - I don't know. It just started playing by itself? It sounded like a warning video. Here, let me show you. All right, let's see this thing. All right, um, not there. Holy shit! What the... - Did you see that too? What is this, some kind of augmented reality app or something? It's Just the camera, some kind of trick. That wasn't a trick. Does that look like a trick to you? I don't like this. We need to leave right now. We need to give this to the cops. Let's go! What happened? I heard the door slam. Let's go. We need to leave. - But we're not done. - Where's Rachel? Rachel... Rachel! - Rachel! Rach! Rachel! Rach? - What? - Ah, Jesus! - Are you okay? - We're leaving. What's wrong? Come on, we gotta get out of here. There's something in this house. What did you find? Cell phone... fuck this mask... with a video of the father who shot himself. Leave it, we'll give it to the cops in the morning. No, something was in the room with us. There was a kid bleeding. Look, I'll explain later. We gotta go right now. Ow... oh! Are you okay? What the hell happened? It won't open! Try the windows! Try the windows. - Come on, come on, get up. Damn it! Ugh, shit. - The bedroom ones won't open. - These won't either! What's happening? Hey, look, someone's out there. - Yo! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, can you hear us? - Can you see us? - Can you open the door? Yo, hey! Why can't they see us? What the hell's going on? I don't know. I don't know. Just relax, let me think. All right, I remember I was walking towards the door, and maybe I stepped on some sort of switch on the floor. Like a lockdown system? What kind of person has a panic house? The kind of guy who collects valuable antiquities. No, no, no, that doesn't explain why you got pulled inside the house. Explain that. I fell backwards. Maybe the ground tilted back when the switch was flipped. Come on, that's insane. The symbol... the symbol. You see this? This is scattered throughout the house. - What is it? - It could be tribal or... - Satanic? - It's not a pentagram. Okay, well, Satanists use more than just pentagrams. All right, maybe it's Wiccan or something. Well, what are you saying? That these murders were some kind of human sacrifice? Yeah, maybe. What if the panic switch wasn't meant to keep people in, but to keep the police out? What about the kid on the phone? Are you sure you really saw that? I know what I saw, all right? I'm not crazy. I saw it too. We need to find a way out of here. - Who are you calling? - Rios. See if we can find this switch. Shit, it's not working. Rach, do you have yours? - Yeah. Let's see. Damn it! Could he have a data jammer in the house? Oh, my God, this isn't a panic house. There's no fucking data jammer. Enough, all right! Marcus? What? This is the phone that I found in the bedroom. How is that possible? Marcus? Marcus, come on! Come on, just answer the fucking phone. Hello? Hey, at least it has reception. Here, give it to me. Hello? Rios! Rios, please help us. Dylan, what the fuck, man? It's late. We're trapped in this house. We need your help! This house is gonna take longer to clean than expected. What's the matter? We're gonna need more time. Can you have the curator come tomorrow afternoon? Yeah, man, that's fine. Everything all right? Just more to clean than we thought. We'll see you in the afternoon. Rios, can you hear us? Please! Yeah, just text me next time, all right? Dylan, what was that voice? Somebody's trying to play a trick on us. They're probably using a voice changer or something, right? No, voice changers can't be that precise. Okay, well, then what was that fucking voice? I don't know. Okay, what are we gonna do now? We're trapped in this house with no phone to call for help. And the battery's dying on this thing. We have to charge it. Oh, my God, fuck charging. Just smash it! No... no, this could be our only way of communication with people. Oh, my God, this is crazy. Marcus, plug it in. What, we're just gonna wait for to charge? Maybe these symbols are the only clues we have to know what the hell is going on here. Rachel. Hailey? Oh, sweetheart, don't cry. Mama's here. All right, okay? Rachel. Rachel. Why would you do that? What the hell are you talking about? You swore to me that you would never tell them! And then you bring this crib? Rach, are you okay? Fuck you, Marcus. Tell us what, Marcus, what is she talking about? Talk to Rachel. Hey, you okay? She was only six months old. The doctor said it was... it's nothing I did. I feel like I did something wrong. I feel like it was my fault. Why didn't you tell me? Because every time I tried... I remembered that it was real, that it happened. And then I went through the pain all over again. It's okay. Come here. You're okay. You're okay. You know, eventually... I stopped trying to tell you. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I lied. I'm sorry about the birth control. I just... I can't go through that again. It's okay. Hey, hey, we can wait, okay? We can wait. I saw her crib. I could hear her crying. But there was no crib in there. It might just be the stress of being locked inside this house, Rach, you know all the blood everywhere... Oh, my God! What the hell is that? Someone's at the door! - Hey, it's Bob. - Someone's at the door! Hello? Hey... hey, open the door! Hey, you hear us? Open the door, open the... Stephen, you home? I just got back into town, and I've got that package for you. - Hello! - Hello! Well, I guess not. It won't open! What the fuck is that? It's this room, just brighter. Should we go through? We don't know what's on the other side. What if it's our only way out? You guys, it's fine. - No, no, Rachel! - Rachel! Ahh! Hold on, something's pulling on her! There's nothing there! Where the hell are you going? Rachel, hold on! Rachel, hold on! Marcus! Hannah? They're not real. How did you get here? How's that possible. I just left you. They aren't real. They're not real. Hey. They're not real. They've been tricking us. Ahh! Ah! Hold on! Who did this to you? You. What? It hurts! Hold on, Rach! Marcus! Hannah, I would never hurt you. It's too late. What? To save her! Oh, my God, what was that? It's the family. They were pulling on you. How did you know there was gonna be something on that phone? I didn't. I just remember seeing the kid on the phone before. How the hell are we gonna get out of here? Look, he drew those for a reason. What if the tridents are pointing us towards something? They point in every direction. There has to be a purpose. Why else are they throughout the house? Huh? - Protection. If they're for protection, then they're fucking useless. She's right, okay? Someone's holding us in this house. Someone made you see the crib, and whatever it is, it is fucking dangerous. All right, I would want protection too. What about the phone? Are there any other videos or photos on that thing? - I don't know. - Well, grab it, let's see it. Guys? Dylan! Rachel! Marcus. Marcus, the phone. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Okay. I couldn't protect them. I got to do the only thing I can to end this. Please know... please know, I didn't... I didn't kill them. I loved my family. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Are there anymore? Yeah. Don't let it go. Don't let it go. It's real. Everything I've read about the artifact is real. I tried to give a piece of it to every member of my family to protect them. But they couldn't hold it. They couldn't. They were too afraid. They let it go. I tried to destroy it. I tried to destroy it. But every time I brought it into one place, I just... I couldn't. It's coming for me. It's coming for me and my son. We tried to escape up into the attic, but every time we thought we were free, it was like we were in the same place. - Dad! - No... no, Milo! Milo! Don't look! It's not real, Milo! It's not real! Don't let it go, Milo! Don't let it go, Milo! No, Milo! No, no, no, no! Hold on, hold on, there's more. This one's the oldest one. Hey there, welcome to another episode of the Urban Explorer. Today I bought a great Norse piece that was found by an explorer in Sweden. This thing came in pieces. Ancient humans crafted it to fit together like a puzzle. How cool is that? Not all the pieces are here yet, so I'm not quite sure what the symbol means, but as soon as I find out, I'll have it for you in future episodes. All right, urban explorers, until the next time, stay curious. That symbol, he discovered it on the artifact. He must have found out what it was. It was real. We need to find out what he learned. He had said that he read about this. Maybe there's something in his office. We need to check it out. Is that really a good idea? Let's go. All right, look for anything with that symbol. The computer's broken too. It must have been the power surge that fried it. He said it was a Norse artifact. Come on, come on, come on, Norse... Norse. I think I found something. This is it, right? It's about a Norse symbol known to be the Helm of Awe. But it's only the bibliography. The rest is missing. It references a text, "Norse Mythological Gods and Spirits." These spines don't have any titles. Maybe they're from the bibliography. Wait, this one's bookmarked. Is it the one the essay referenced? Hold on, I'm looking. Wait, this is it! The Aegishjálmr, or Helm of Awe, was a Norse rune that would grant a person immortality, but drive everyone around them insane. It absorbed energy to protect the bearer by seeking fears and enemies it could exploit. So it targets fears. Which would explain why Rachel saw the crib, and I saw Hannah. You saw me? I saw you in the master bedroom while Rachel was being pulled. You were in the corner. You were beaten. That's your greatest fear? You said I did it, all right? That's what I'm afraid of. The Helm of Awe would call upon a death demon to kill the aggressor. What the hell is a death demon? Once summoned, the death demon would destroy all those who did not possess the Helm of Awe. So even though his family each had a piece of the artifact, they would be so scared that they would drop it. Yeah, which would allow this death demon to be able to kill them. Look, it says, the only way to stop it is the complete destruction of the object that was inscribed by the gods. Come on, guys, you can't possibly believe this. Well, how else would you explain it? It's a fucking fairy tale. Well, explain how we're locked in this house. Wait, maybe we're not locked in this house. But I don't know, maybe we just think we are. You tried to open the doors and windows for yourself. They won't open. And I once saw a guy under hypnosis who couldn't lift a carton of milk. God, that's a fucking parlor trick. All right, wait a second, all right? If the rune was inscribed by the gods, then why would he draw it around the house? To protect his family. He was desperate. I mean, maybe he was full of shit, and he had no idea how to stop this thing. I mean, look around. He seems to have known enough. Not enough to save his family. What would you have liked the guy to do? I would have had him smash the fucking thing as soon as he got it. That's it, we need to find the artifacts and smash them for good. What other choice do we... Dylan... Dylan! - Oh, shit! - Dylan? Ah... agh, Jesus! Ah, shit! Dylan! Ah... ah! What's happening? What's wrong... what's wrong? The ringing... it's ringing. It's ringing in my head! Dylan! Hey! It's in control of my head! Baby, it's not happening, okay? Listen to me. It's not happening. It's okay. I can't see... I can't see. - It's gonna be okay. - I can't see. Okay, it's okay. I'm right here, okay? Ugh... ah! - Rachel! Dylan? Dylan! I love you, Rachel. No! Dylan, Dylan, Dylan! It's real. No, this could be fake. - I'm sorry, Rachel. - No. He's gone. - We gotta go. - No. We gotta go. It could be making us see this. This could be a hallucination. You saw the videos. It came for them one by one. Here, take this, hold on to this. Don't let go. Hannah, hey, you okay? We need to get the rest of the relics. It's the only chance we got. And how... when he said that he couldn't escape, how are we going to? All I know is that if the owner was right, those pieces are gonna protect us, so we each need to get our hands on one. Now, those pieces, they seem to draw the demon closer. They gotta be where the family was killed. So that means they're downstairs, master bedroom, kids' room. We're gonna go downstairs first. Okay? - Uh-huh. All right. Dylan? Dylan, is that you? It's not real, Rachel. It's not real. It's not really Dylan. Ahh! Shh. - Easy, easy, - Shh. - Easy, easy. - Shh-shh-shh. - What happened? - You passed out. How are you feeling? Are you lightheaded? No, I... did I hit my head? - No, no, you collapsed. - I heard Marcus shouting. Are you sure you're okay? Did you want us to take you to the hospital? I'm fine. Oh, okay, whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy... Take it slow. - Who was on that call? That was Rios. He had a job for us. But I told him to call somebody else. - Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. Come on, let's get you up. One, two, three. - Slowly. - Oh. - Whoa, you're all right. - You okay? Yes. I just need to splash some water on my face. Ahh... ahh! No! Rachel... hey, what... what's wrong? Rachel, hey, hey! What happened? I was home with Dylan, and I passed out, and you were there, and... I don't... I just... I thought... Okay, okay, okay, okay, shh-shh-shh-shh, relax. We're gonna get out of here. Okay, okay. Come on, come on. Keep moving! Ah, what is that? Ahh! All right, look, whatever happens, we push through the fear. We can't let it stop us. How do we know this thing isn't near us? We don't. Ahh! Oh, God, can they gonna open the door? God, I hope not. Are they running to something or from something? We need to hurry. I found it! Pick up the bed, I can't reach it! Did you get it? Uh-huh. Got it. Rachel! Rachel. Rachel, help me! Come on. No, he's here. No, no, no, no, no, no, hold on to this, okay? Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go! Okay, he needs me to opens the door. They tried take me away, but I fought them for you, to be with you. Rachel, get away from the door! Rachel, it's a trick! No! - Rachel! - Let me in. - No! No! Thank you. No! No! Marcus! We can't stay here. It's gonna get through. What do we do? I'll hold the door, okay? You find the other two artifacts. - Are you sure you can hold it? - Just go, go, go! - Marcus. - Hannah! Did you find it? Marcus, open up! Where the fuck do you think you're going with that? Dylan. You spineless piece of shit. Ah, fuck. Whatever you're seeing, it's not real! Just to get a fix and sell your shit, you fucking waste. How could you let Marcus go to jail for you? No. For you! - Hannah, you okay? - I saw Dylan! He had a knife. I couldn't breathe. Come here. Help me brace the door. Come on! He knew what I did to you. He knows what happened. He knows that you took the fall for me. I should have never let you take the fall. It's okay. If I had to do it all over again, I would, okay? I was an asshole. How are we gonna get out of here? We only have three pieces. Okay, look, there's one piece in the master bedroom, all right? It's just around the corner. I'm gonna distract it. - No! - Yes. You're gonna go in there, and you're gonna find the piece. Then you're gonna put it together, and you're gonna fucking destroy it, all right? He'll kill you. He'll kill you. Look, we have no other choice. It's gonna keep coming for us unless we end this, all right? I don't wanna make you do this again. Please. Look at me. Finish this. Okay? Look at me. You count to three, and then you go, all right? One. Two. Three. Come on. Come on, come on, you son of a bitch! Come on! Come on! Come on. Go fuck yourself. Ahh! Do it, smash it. What happened? I heard you screaming. I got away... come on, destroy it so we can end this. I'm missing a piece! God damn it! Just smash whatever you have! You're not real. You just want me to drop it! Once a thief, always a thief. You stupid bitch! Agh! Ahh! Oh, shit. Scream! The dark! Scream! Scream! December 22, examiner, Leila Walsh, cataloging the personal effects of Stephen Jenson. One brown leather wallet, trifold with a California driver's license. Two cards in the wallet, including credit or debit card ending in 2610. No cash inside wallet. Key ring. Four keys unmarked. One receipt for the Coffee Cabana. And I think that's it for the pock... Actually, no, there is one more thing in the pocket here. Some kind of jagged stone. The deceased appears to have deep incisions along his torso, consistent with...
