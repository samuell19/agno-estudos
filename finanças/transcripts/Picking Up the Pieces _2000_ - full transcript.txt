Had a butchershop in New York and I met her. You know, it was love at first lap dance. She had a boyfriend before me who was in with the Mob. She testified against him and he didn't take it too kindly. 50, we came out to Texas... primari/y for the a/n You know, actually, we wanted to keep breathing it. So, we get the hell out. We came out here. I started .; little butcher shop. Went into hiding is what happened. And now, ladies and gentlemen... a woman with a truly miraculous body... Miss Candy Cowley. Isn't that great? She's all porterhouse. I'll take a slice of that. Who loves you, baby? I loved that woman. Idid, Pinky. I can't help it. I loved her. She was- She was something. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that I never should have married her. Because that's what you said. You said, "Don't get involved." You said that she was gonna cheat on me. And you were right. Don't rub it in. Come on. Hurry up. I recognize this leg. She used to wrap this around everybody in town. Hurry up, Pinky. Ifa car comes along and sees all these pieces, they'll suspect something. Come on! Come on! Will you grab some of the choice cuts? You were always her favorite. Come on. Let's go! Give me that. I have the full set, I think, now. Give me her head. I gotta have her head. Wait, wait. This is a heavy woman. I think I got everything. I lost count. Thanks for all your help, Pinky. It's only fair to remind you that you're an accessory here. So, don't get any ideas about squealing. Look here. I'll mark where we put her, in case you ever wanna visit. Because your instincts as a dog are not exactly great. Are you okay, senor? Yes, yes. No, I'm great. I've never felt better. You don't need water? It's very hot. What were you hauling in there? My ex-wife. Your ex-wife? You're a funny guy. Welcome to El Nifio. For Christ's sake, are you blind, lady? It's a miracle! I can see! I can see! Did you see her? I saw her, but she couldn't see me. What do you want? I want to park. So park it anywhere. That was heaven. Like you've been there. Oh, I've been there. When? Just now. Admit it, Desi. You love me. Look at you, Leo. You got no money, no car, no house. No looks. Nobody's perfect. Besides, you make a pretty good living. I think enough to support the both of us. Hey, do you know what happened to the last man who tried that? Desi, guess who's here. Mini-dick? Ah, Carlita. Why do you tease me? I always ask for you and I always give you a big tip. Take his money. There is enough mercy fucking going on around here. Okay. Bye, Desi. And you, get dressed. Not quite yet. Time's up. You have to go to work. What work? I don't believe in my work anymore. That may be... but some people in this town are still dumb enough to count on you... Padre. What you got there, Paco? Cockroach? Isee you Can you see me Nice trip See you next fall We've been looking for you, Dafia Constancia. Dafia Constancia, where's your cane? Oh, my God! Dan Ricardo was really worried. What is that? You're walking without a cane. Can you see? What is that, a Seeing Eye hand? You better be careful. Oh, my God! What is that? I have to see Fatherjerome. What happened to your eyes? Good morning, Father. You look like you could use some coffee. Thank you, Unojo. Fatherjerome, I heard you and Desi in there. You know, Father, it is better to lose an argument to her than an eye. Like me. It's too early for that. Lalo, how are you today? Good morning, Father. Fine, thank you. Are you still instructing that poor girl in the faith? I'll need many, many more sessions to convert her. Maybe she'll convert you, eh? Maybe. Padre, could you baptize our baby this morning? Of course. I'm on my way now. Meet me in the church. So, this is television? Ilike it. I baptize you in the name of the Father... and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Welcome to life, n/fia. May God bless your child. Icouldn't wait. When I saw this, I knew this had to come to you. You can see? Sf You can? Sf I knew deep in my soul it's a miracle. It's a miracle. Miracle? Yes, Father. Well, I'd like a second opinion. It's a fucking miracle, all right. You're kidding. There's no other explanation. She was really blind? You want the medical term? Blind as a stinking bat. You did all the tests? The charts? The x-rays? Fatherjerome, please. But she fell. I mean, shejust hit her head. Maybe the optic nerves. I'm telling you- What about hysterical blindness? Spontaneous cure? Fatherjerome, I am her doctor, 30, 35 years now. lam in the medical business, not in the miracle business. Iwill find out the real cause of all this, believe me. But yesterday, this woman was blind. Today, she sees. 50, for now, you of all people, Padre... should believe this is the handiwork of the Lord. The Lord has tiny little hairs on His hand. Look at the fingers. So delicate, so smooth. It must be the hand of the Virgin. I'm sure the Virgin had turquoise polish. Look, for nowfor now, let'sjust keep this to ourselves. Okay? Keep what to ourselves? Exactly. I forgot to tell you, the bishop called again this morning. Why didn't you tell me? Because it was early this morning. Right. Did he say what he wanted? He wants your ass. There's been rumors about the guy for years, but- I think he wants you to shut this place down. Is that all? I thought it was something important. Maybe not to you. I think they can take care of themselves. You're all they've got. Who am I kidding? Hey, Haco. Why should I feel guilty? It's crazy. Like I did something wrong. I did not do anything wrong. Idismembered my wife. You'd think it was a whole to-do. Gosh, it's funny. Now that she's in seven separate pieces, I sort of miss her a little. "Love, Candy." I guess I should have known something was wrong... when she put her measurements inside the ring. "36, 25, 36." What are you so depressed about? Cheer up, or I'm gonna have to slip some Prozac into your Alpo. "Together Forever, Tex." You're not so together now, are you? What the hell am I doing? Is this religion? This isn't religion. It's voodoo with a collection basket. Who are you talking to? Oh. To you, actually. How are you? Sit. Yes, ma'am. I love it when you're rough. Here. What's that? A little something to help you rebuild. Dirty money? Look, you work your side of the street. I'll work mine. Did it ever occur to you God doesn't like His house looking like shit? And what are you doing with this? The old woman wants it authenticated. As what? The hand of the Virgin. Forgive me, Leo. ldon't think so. Idon't either. So, what are you going to do? I think I'm gonna give it to the police. You're not. Bobo. That's Officer Bobo of the Texas State Police to you, pal. They made you a state trooper. Congratulations. I'm sure everybody's gonna sleep more easily knowing you're on the job. As a matter of fact, they do. That's great. What do you want? I know what you want, but she's not here. Mind ifl sniff around? Sniffaround? Come in, putz. You can snif - Stay right here, Tex. Ijust wanna make sure you didn't do anything foolish the other night. Why would you think that even? That's not very friendly, is it? Sit. Sit. Sit, Pinky. I do like a bitch that does what she's told. You sure Candy's not here? 'Cause I really would love to talk to her. I already told you. She's not here. Not funny. Not. I trust you, Tex. I'll go find her down at the Donut Dude. She pulled the night shift. The old graveyard shift. You be sure to tell her Bobo came by to say hi. For the life of me, I'll never figure out why she married you. Maybe shejust likes my meat. He thought it was funny. He liked it. I'm Conchata Ortiz, in the wonderful, picturesque town of El Nifio... where we're awaiting the unveiling of the miraculous hand. The ceremony is about to begin with Fatherjerome performing the ritual. Here comes the mayor. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

Idon't have the kind of time to- What about my steaks? What did it look like to you? Were you frightened? lt looked like a hand With a finger up like that. Oh.

I hope you're keeping track of all these guys for tax purposes. What guys? I don't know what you're talking about. You make up so many things 'cause you always wanna blame me. Why don't you just suck on this 'cause that's the last you'll see of me. Thank you, darling. Get out of my way. See? It's bringing people in. Aren't you proud of me? Mayor Machado wants to build a hotel here. He's talking to people about it. Really? I don't think we'll get that many visitors. Do you? I mean, one little miracle is not- Oh, my!

I asked him about it today and His Holiness said, and ! quote... ”Hey, ga figure. ” Can you believe this? They think that this woman is now the Mother of God. Unbelievable. Our Lady of Lapland.

I know, because that's women. Their hair blower and a blow-dryer... nothing as small as a Volkswagen. Well, you can't really live with them and you can't shoot them. Well, maybe you can. Where is she? She's working. I already checked that out. What did you do with her? I could ask you the same question. And I know what you'd answer me. Ifyou'd excuse me. You wanna come nicely, Tex? Or do you like to wear these as much as she does? Turn around. You can't do this to me. I'm gonna arrest you. I'm making a citizen's arrest here. You're under arrest. I formally charge you with sedition... and alienation of affection. Watch your head there. You've never read me my rights. I have rights. This is unconstitutional. I have friends in high places.

Relax, Padre. Hey, how many do you think there will be? Two, maybe three. Tourists, Father. Tourists. Look, look, Mayor. I'm starting to feel funny about this. Hey, take a guess. I don't know. First day? How many could there be? I. Ron Hubbard ain't dead. Every year he has a new book. Right down the street, people, they call that place church. They say it's God's house. How is that God's house? Like God came to somebody and said, "Build me a house on 5th Street." That ain't God's house. That's big business house. Big business call it religion. These people could learn something. I'm here to give you the finger, people. Come on. Plenty of suckers to go around. The miraculous hand. Everybody comes to the One Eye Cantina now, eh, cookie? Give me this. Stop that. At least keep it in the bedroom where it belongs. Father, I can walk. I give you these. Thank you. Please, get up. Get up. Thank you. Say cheese, please.

That's what they said. lain't got much... but I'll talk to the ho. Just likejesus did. Remember, they was throwing stones at Mary Magdalene. Jesus walked up and said, "Stop it! That's my ho.” Now, I ain't one to say Jesus was a pimp... but he had 3 ho. And he let that ho go, didn't He? Free the ho. Let the ho go. Can I get an amen? Amen. The message here today is... God lives within. If the body's the temple, you walk around in church. Ha W you ensz y your church Does your church feel good Do you feel As good as I da Fatherjerome. Over here. Rick Houseman, Channel 4. Could we talk to you for a minute, please? Good morning, Father darling. How do you like it? You're making retab/as ofyour miracle? Everybody in New Mexico paints them. They paint one, Constancia, to show their gratitude to God. Well, I'm very grateful. But you're selling them. Here, Father, for your church. Miracle fingers. One dollar. Money goes to the poor. Poor me. Look at this, Padre. This is precious! Isn't it? It'll bring you a miracle. I'll have to have this. Well, all right. There you go. That'll do. Ten percent tithing. Here, Father, for your church. I love my legs. God bless America. Padre, isn't this amazing? Desi, we have to talk. I'd love to talk, but pleasure before business. Do you want to stop at the church? Oh, no, little lady. The only congregating I wanna do is with you. Yeah, buddy. Here, Father. For your church. What do you think? Looking good, eh? What wonderful carving... your little townsfolk do, Father. Given what an ignorant and superstitious people they must be. Where is the relic, Father? I thought we might wait, what with the crowds and all. You're not trying to pull one over on me, are you, Padre? No. I warn you. I'm the devil's advocate for the Archbishop of New York. It's my job to expose the phonies... and the fakers and fools who would try to suckle... on the tit of Holy Mother Church. And... I can be a real prick. Have you ever operated heavy machinery while taking antihistamines? No. Ever failed to close cover before striking? Ever lied to have sex? Actually, when I think about it, once. But I was alone at the time... and I was younger- very impressionable. Okay, Tex. Tell me. Have you ever killed your wife in a jealous rage... after catching her in flagrante fellatio? Definitely not. Bullshit! Goddamn machine is not working. I want another test. Get another machine. Are you gonna let me go or do I have to call my attorney? You saw us, didn't you? Saw who? That's when you did it. Right after. Did what? I don't know what you're talking about. Are you confessing to something, Officer? 'Cause ifyou are, I would be very, very careful about what I said. I'm getting out of here. I wanna thank everybody. Everyone concerned was very thoughtful... moving my truck out to the front. It was very nice seeing you. And good-bye. I'll call you. We'll have lunch. You need to get another goddamn machine. Shit! This style is 17th-century Spanish mission. But ifyou look closely- Spare us Architecture 101, Padre. It's obvious you love your church. But do you love it as a belief... or as a building? You cannot dishonor one to restore the other, eh, Father? Here's the hand. Fatherjerome, why on earth would heaven choose you? Hey, Ijust work here. This could be the work of the devil. Yes, yes, but look- look around you. Look at all the crutches... and hearing aids and wheelchairs. So your theory is this is the work... of heaven? Well... what do you say I show you the rest of the town. And then maybe later tonight we can relax... have some fun? Fun? Fun. It's kind ofa new concept. Maybe you've heard of it. Okay, maybe you haven't. But it's real popular. It's good to see somebody who didn't dig and grovel for one of them miracles. Amigo, I have to keep the patch on... or else I have to change the name of my place. Look. Girls, watch. I want to show everybody my miracle. This, watch this. You are surprised, huh? Cover your eyes, Sister. The devil is at large. He certainly is. Where are you going? Church. You want a miracle too, huh? Ah, Desi, how'd you like to take it out for a test drive? Come on, Pequefio. I'll take you. No, I want Desi. I love you good. I don't take second best anymore. Hey, Pequefio. Here. Buy somebody else. Jealous, Leo? Wow. That's the miracle of the day. Come with me, puta. You like what I do to you, huh? I like even more what it's doing to him. Compliments of the house. Thank you. Sister. Father LaCage, we go! You'll burn in hell! Burn in hell, where! What the hell is happening to everybody? Oh, miraculous hand. I want to ask you for something... but it's kind of embarrassing. You see, everybody in town makes fun of me. They call me la tart/lla because I'm 50 fiat. And I don't want my boyfriend to leave me for another one. Because Ijust tattooed his name on my finger. Iwant chi-chis. Big chi-chis, like the ones in the magazines. You'll burn in hell! Burn in hell! Where! Fuck. Get down! Do you want a drink? What if that hand really is from heaven? That's crazy. Is it? Because if it's real, I'm in trouble. This may be news to you... but God doesn't exactly like what I do for a living. Maybe there really is a miracle for me too. Ididn't ask for it, but... something is going on here. And ifit is what it looks like... I'm ready to change my life. What do you think? Change your life? No, wait. Forgive me, Father... but right now... I need to talk to a priest. Okay, abuel/ta, spread 'em. You need a license to be a prostitute, and a proper uniform. It's very interesting how these people celebrate the Day of the Dead. I want to get on my knees for you. I love men in black. Sinners, repent. We'll give you a discount. Park it out front. In front of what? Hello. Nice crowd, huh? It is also our annual Day of the Dead here in El Nifio.

Holy Mother! Pretty big, huh? Jesus Christ! Let me see. It won't be long. Oh, no way. Thanks. Hello. It's worth the wait. Mr. Officer, let's have some fun. Desi, we have to talk. It won't be long. I've heard what you've been doing with that woman. Iwill have to tell the bishop. You will? Why? I should think you would beg me to tell the bishop. After all, you've taken a hardened prostitute... from sinner to celibate. Celibate, yes. Must be very satisfying. It was. Get lost! Stay away! Oh, Candy. That ain't right. I'm gonna kill you, Tex. I got ticket number 40 here. Just $100. Go right in. Ticket number 40. Ask for big titties in there, and then come see me, okay? The name's Haco. Ticket 40, $] 00. Who wants it? I want it! You want it? Here you go. $100. Thank you very much, sir. Give it to me. Thank you. All right. Hold it. Ticket? Get in line, sir. Nojumping. You know the rules. Now dawdling, people. Just get your miracle and move on. I can hear! Hey, nice pants. Is that a new uniform? I could kick his ass back to Texas. All right, so you got two eunuchs and a penguin. What do we bribe them with? I don't know. Listen to me, priest. We've gota major franchise here. What? A "Would-you-like-a-miracle- with-your-fries" kind of franchise? Exa ct(y. It's notjust the investigators I gotta sweet. I've got the investors muscling in hard on me. My j0b's at stake here. Damn it! I should have turned this hand over to the police. If the police ever solved a case, that'd be the biggest miracle of all. Mr. Mayor? Padre, I gotta go. There's somebody at the door. I think we need to talk. Next. Sweetheart... it's me. Is it actually you? I mean, I recognize the finger. 'Cause you used to give it to me all the time... but the whole thing is so incredible. They think you're 3 Virgin. Can you believe that? Of all the people... my shi/(sa wife 3 Virgin. I mean, it's astonishing. You got to help me out. Ifyou can do anything at all. Ican't blame you ifyou hate me, but do me a favor. Don't work against me, okay? That man is a butcher! God! Well, that's an honorable profession. No, no. I mean what he did to her. Apparently, he cut her up in seven pieces. Seven? You found them all? All but one.]ust outside your chickenshit little town. Guess which piece was missing. Well, you don't think- Our hand is miraculous. Was this man's wife a saint? Well, she could do some pretty amazing things with her tongue... but a saint, no. Is there a complaint somewhere? A missing persons report? I don't see one here. The hand had a wedding ring on it. I'd like to have a look at that, ifyou don't mind. I'd like to see a warrant. This is New Mexico, not Texas. Fatherjerome, I told the detective here we would fully cooperate with him. Ijust think the detective is a little out of hisjurisdiction, don't you? And I have a feeling this is personal in some way. lam at this time more than prepared to take a fingerprint... ofyour "miraculous hand." I'm sure you are. You were so damn beautiful. That's the problem. God made you just too beautiful. You know, the same way He's gonna make me fry. And I can't blame Him. I did the wrong thing. I know that. But what do you want me to do? You cheated on me continually, you know. Why did you marry me in the first place, ifyou were gonna cheat all the time? And with guys like Bobo. I mean, give me 3 break. And then it wasn'tjust Bobo. It was like a whole string of Bobos. And none of them loved you. None of them were faithful to you. I was the only one who loved you and who was faithful to you. Sir, people are waiting. Do you have a request? Ijust wanna tell her that I'm sorry. He says he's sorry. Okay? Move to the red gratitude line, please. Excuse me. Next. Sorry. Everybody, watch out. Move back. Nobody moves here. Out of my way. Everybody, down! Freeze, Tex! Nobody moves. Stay back. We'll talk later. You're busy. You gotta help me, Father. I think we should talk. I'm sorry. Let go of me. He's out there! Stay back! Calm down! Hey, what are you doing? Our only chance is if he escapes. Let's get him! Let's get him! There he is! Don't let him get away. Where did he go? Shit! My crib, your crib. Have some coffee. He's got the hand, man! It's worth a lot of money. Did they catch him? No, not yet. Yes, there is 3 God. That's what I'm afraid of. Listen. Man, I hope that guy can run. In the meantime, here's a toast. To borrowed time. I don't drink. Yeah, right. Here you go. Good time to start. Salud. I thought you were going to talk to that cop. Sorry I doubted you. Here, Father. Here's for the church. What? Religion's a bloody business. What did you get into it for? I wanted to help people. I grew up on the street, like Paco and Haco. At one time I thought I could help kids like that. At one time you thought you could do without sex too. A woman was killed. You want the man to just get away? Hey, 2,000 years ago, a certain man was killed. If that man wasn't killed, you wouldn't have a religion. Jesus. Well, you know the case. What ifhejust got prison? Time off for good behavior. There'd be no Christianity. It's a great argument for capital punishment. There's a comforting thought. Yeah! Kill the motherfucker! Kill him! Yeah, Meche, kill him! Oh, I can't see! I can't see! I can't see! Your eye. Your eye. Oh, no. My eye! Grand champion of El Nifio! The miracles are reverting. My legs! My legs! The fountain stopped? There he is! He's getting away! What are you trying to do, stupid? Give us the finger! I need some help. Now's the time, sweetheart! You believe the Virgin would listen to you? You guys have a great little town here. I love everything- Looks like you're trying to resist arrest, Tex. Look. It's Hopalong Quesadilla. Oh, great. My day is made. My here's here. Back off, greaseball. This here is my prisoner. You people can all go back to your mule farms or wherever the hell-— No, you go back to Texas,]ohn Wayne. The people only want the hand of the Virgin. Yeah! That hand was no virgin. You better tell us where it is. Don't worry. He'll talk. Yeah, you give me the little mamma. I'll make him talk. Please! Please! Kneel, please. Me? Go home, cowboy. This man is under arrest for theft. Ifyou think he did more, swear out a warrant. He's not going anywhere. I'll swear out a warrant. Take it easy, fellas. This is a rented car. Watch your head, please. Steady, steady. Hey, take it easy. You're bending the starch. Now, look. Here's the mayor. Show some respect. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You're very lucky. We're going to serve dinner in 20 minutes, but only ifyou're quiet. You only got that son ofa bitch on petty theft. I got him on murder! You want to extradite him? Show me some papers. You piece of shit. He murdered that girl. Maybe. Maybe not. But only three people know that. You, me and that priest over there. The future of this town depends on it stayingjust like that. Is that supposed to be some kind of threat? The secret would be safer if there were only two. Burn the place down! We want the hand! Look, it's gonna- I think I'm gonna be tied up here in El Nifio for quite a while... so I need you to take e bus or hitchhike here. It 's in south west New Mex/ca. You 're a great dag, Pin/(y, and- Right. Yes. No, no. It's not funny. Don't laugh. And get here as quick as you can. Okay. Listen. lfyou ever want to talk, ifyou need anything- Actually, ifyou have a key to this place... that would be extremely helpful. And I'd like to talk to you about your wif - what's left of her. I know it may be a sensitive subject. Asshole. Did you have any idea she performed miracles? I can only tell you that I never realized how much I loved her. Now that she's gone, you know, I really miss her. Hey, Tex! Guess what. They're not gonna be able to keep you in here much longer. Iwill be seeing you real soon. You too, Juan Valdez. You gatyaursau/ You gatyaur Father! Liquor's always quicker. You look like you're at the crossroads, Father. Let me give you a little advice about life. YOU can save your GSS... or you can save your soul. But you can't save both. You can't save both? That's right. Your ass, or your soul. Ass. Ass. Soul. Soul. Got no other choice You can't save both! You can sa ve your soul oryou can sa ve your ass Asshole. I was saving my ass! Desi? I'm so glad you- How do you know? Know what? We're telling the bishop tonight. Telling him what? It is not the hand of the Virgin Mary. Thank you. But it's... definitely the hand ofa very powerful saint. Santa Maria. By the nature of the miracles, we're pretty sure she's American. Dr. Amado, you agree with this? Science can puta man on the moon... but we cannot always get the pigeons off the roof. What? lt means I don't have a stinking idea. The good doctor is coming over to our side. Miracles are something we don't have enough data on... but I will never stop my investigation. I have never had a patient who said... "Forget the surgeon. Get me a holy icon." Trust me. Trust us. We will discover who this gring/'ta saint is. This is in the Church's best interest, Father- Your best interest. The miraculous hand is a new symbol of faith. In short, it's working for us. Let's keep it that way, shall we? Come! We shall pray for guidance. Will you join us, Father? I'm going to take a rain check. Hi, asshole. You all right? Yes, I'm fine. How are you? Me? Yeah, I'm good. I'm doing real good. Except they put me in no smoking. You're telling me that you're- Yeah. My God. What is it like? Oh, it's so nice. They got all these marvelous people up there. And a great view. How did you get out? I snuck out. Really? Yeah. What are they going to do, kill me? That's a good point. Listen. I haven't got a lot of time. I just want to tell you... I'm so grateful to you. You are? Yeah. They said lwouldn't have got in if it wasn't for you. You're gonna tell me about the Saint Peterjunk? Yeah! Can you believe that shit? No, I don't. Me neither. It's a little hazy... but they did tell me that I wasn't exactly heaven material. I think it's all the drinking... and fornicating... and adultery. Yeah, well, I'm sure those people... can be extremely picky about that stuff. Yes, but they said I deserved it because I suffered so much with you. Thank you. Thanks very much for that. The end part wasn't so good. That hurt. Don't you ever do that to anybody again. I'm sorry. Look at the bright side. I'm here now, right? I guess it's like what they say about childbirth, you know? It's so wonderful afterwards... you forget the whole thing when it's over. We never had any children. I guess I would have made a pretty shitty mom anyway. Got a cigarette? Oh, brother. Look, there is something you could do for me. My hand? Would you put it back? Hey, I can't exactly roam free here. Yeah. I started to forget all about walls and everything. Well, you see what you can do, all right? And I'll do what I can on my end. The other thing is, you know- I'd really appreciate it ifyou'd put my wedding ring back on it. I'd really like that. I think I would like that too. Thanks alot. You take care of yourself. Can I ask you a question? Shoot All that miracle stuff- that stuff that was happening- This was you? You were behind all that? I gotta go. No, I want to know. Because I think if people felt there was something extra... you know, more of a hereafter or something... that they would be a lot nicer to one another. Yeah? I do believe that they would. Well... I say fuck 'em. Let them figure it out for themselves. Pinky, you got here! And you found it. I've been looking for this. How did you do it? Now we can get out of here. Except I promised her that I wouldn't do that. They're gonna put me away for along time, Pinky. I mean, ifyou committed the same crime... in dog years it would be seven times as much... so that's how you have to calculate. I hope you didn't wait for me, pal. Thanks, Pinky. I finally got someone who'll be faithful to me. Bless me, Father. Desi, what are you doing? I'm here to relieve you, Leo. Desi, please. We can't have sex here. We're not going to have sex. Oh, what? You want to play bingo? We are going to make love. And I'm going to show you the difference. Desi, why are you doing this? Because you love me. I do? And I love you. You do? Yes, Ido. Yes, but we're in the house of God. Desi, please. You have to go. And God is love, no? Yes, but- So what better place to make love than in the house of love? I don't think that's what He has in- Don't think. Love. What do we do now? You're on, Padre. Father- Father, forgive me, because, you know... it's been so long since I've confessed. Actually, technically, I've never confessed because... you know, first of all, I'mjewish. You know, so that could... throw a monkey wrench into the whole thing, I'm sure. Incidentally, I personally... never had anything to do with the killing ofjesus. Ijust want to put your mind at ease. You know, I guess I'm- You know, I was thinking of that old joke by Lenny Bruce. I don't know ifyou know Lenny Bruce. He was a comedian in the 19605. And they asked him if he felt responsible for killingjesus... and he said, "No, it was just a party that got out of hand." So that was... a funny joke that- Obviously, you know, not perfect for this room... but he did very well with it. Anyhow, I want to confess. I did kill my wife. I did itjust once. Tex? Tex, we have to talk. Do you have a girl in there? Yes. Do you love her? Yes. Do you love her so much that sometimes you want to kill her? Oh, yeah. I gota feeling you're going to understand... what I have to say completely. Open up! Open the door! Let us in! Open up! Is there a back door into the church? We want the hand! My friends, please. The church is closed. They told us you had the hand in there! Help us, Virgin! Please, come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? Screw tomorrow. I want my miracle back now! And I want to kill that thief with my bare hands. Here. I think this belongs to you. So what now? That's up to you. Well, shall I give myself up? There are many ways of doing penance. You know, you could always tell the cops that I did it. I'm bound by the seal of Confession. But I'm not. I know you told God you're sorry... and maybe God can forgive you for what you did. But as a woman, ldon't know ifl can. Idon't even know ifl should. Ican't bring her back. Maybe you have. Hey, listen to me! Come on. Let's get you some cover. Come on, come on. Get out of here. My friends, wait! Wait, everybody! Please! Please! This is your church! Don't do that! This is God's house! What are you doing, for God's sake? Go. Get out of here, Desi. It's all your fault, Padre. You're gonna pay for this. Unojo, I'll take your other eye, I swear to God. Folks, I think I have what you want right here. No, that's enough. That is enough. You people are going to hear the truth. No, Leo, don't. That is not the hand of the Virgin. It isjust the hand ofa woman- a poor, innocent woman. Not that innocent. Then how do you explain- I can't explain it. And I can't either. And from now on... I'm not even gonna try. But Padre, what about us? Yes, Father? Ithinkyou can take care of yourselves. Did you ever even think about what was going to happen to us? Why are you abandoning us? Look, you'll find a way. I'm sorry. This has all been a terrible misunderstanding. No, Father, there's no misunderstanding. I had legs. And I had my eye! And I had a great pair of tits. Yeah, and they weren't my imagination, Father. And I could see. These people want you dead. They mayor here wants you dead. And when you give back that hand, the state of Texas... is gonna want you dead. Yes, I have many friends. Father, wait. He's going to turn the hand over to who? Look, I like everybody in the room. It's just that you're a little overwrought. The hand has to go to the police. Then, maybe after the trial- But God brought the miraculous hand to us. And a whole lot of money. You know, I can do wonderful things with brisket. I could form the hand- We could keep ita secret. And the tourists will keep coming. It'll be business as usual. Listen to me. This man just confessed to- Father, besides us here, who else knows about this? I do. Who's that? This man murdered his wife. That's her hand he's holding there. Now, you good people wouldn't want to let this man... get away with murder, would you? Yeah, let's get him. We know he's a thief. No, he brought the hand back to us. The hand goes with me. It's evidence. You're not taking the hand! Probably better if I just took my punishment. Tonight this is still my church... and I'm giving this man sanctuary until everyone cools down. I have a warrant to bring this man back... and it does not specify dead or alive. Best of luck. I've completely rethought my position. I'm staying. Hey, this poor guy isjust doing hisjob now. Fireworks coming! Get the chandelier! You people are gonna pay! I'm a Texas State Trooper! Up! Oh, yeah! Do you like that? Yeah! Burn, baby, burn! You burrito-eating little bastard! And the devil said to the Lord above [ oak at Whatyaurpeap/e da Well... I told you I'd get it back for you... and now, you know, you got it. I think that I'm going to be going over to Texas. You know, they have the death penalty in Texas... so I could very well find myself... dead in Texas- which is probably redundant. Do you have any... final advice for me? G reat. Well, ifl run into you up there... you know, I'll leave a message with your answering service. So long, toots. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to Lalo's E! Nir'wo Tours. Off to your fight, you see aur/ave/y placeta... with Disco Fever and the Peacock Club. Over here we have Carla's bordello and Unojo's saloon. Off to the far right we have the El Nifio Church... where a lot of our religious activity... and many miracles have occurred in this church. El N/fio is a VEIJ/ busy town. 50 What does this all mean? Bobo was doing his job. He got tortured. Candy cheated [ike hell. She got heaven. The townspeople killed .; cop, and they got miracles. The mayor corrupted everybody. This guy gets reelected. The priest renounced his vows and he got married. I loved like .; madman, and I'm going to get executed. ls this supposed to be funny? I'm afraid God is sending us all a message- Ifyou can't take ajoke, go fuck yourself.
