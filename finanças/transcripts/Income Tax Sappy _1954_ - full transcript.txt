I say you can. And I say you can't. You can. Now, look, you can't spend all the money we've made just to buy a new home. He's right, sis. We've gotta save some money for the income tax. Oh, don't be chumps. Make out your returns in such a way that you don't have to pay income tax. Why didn't you guys think of that? Ouch. Ouch. Oh, cut the malarkey. I've gotta go shopping. Get busy. Hey, she's right. Tomorrow's the deadline. Oh, I put out some lunch for you. Hot dogs and stuff. I'll see you later. Okay. Goodbye. Say, after all, making out the income tax is nothing. What do you mean nothing? When I get through, the income tax collector will get nothing. Hey, you know what's funny? How people love to gyp on their income tax. That's because it's such a cinch. They never can catch smart guys like us. No. We'll hornswoggle them. All right, all right. It ain't that funny, you laughing hyenas. Oh! Oh! Get out of here. I resent that. Oh, go to work. Force me. Why, you... Get out. Get out. Hold that. You nitwit. You ruined my trophy. Now, help me pick up the pieces so I can repair it. Here's a nice big piece. Let me have it. With pleasure. I'll murder you. Cut it out, Moe. Moe, you cut it out now. Here, here, wait a minute. We've got work to do. Okay. Help me with this, will you? How much can I deduct for charity? Anything. Take $3000. Oh, that's very good. Yeah, but you gotta put down who got the money. I got it. Oh, you'll never get away with that. Why not? Charity begins at home. You're a smart imbecile. Yeah. Hey, what's that? Twenty-five hundred dollars for my operation. Twenty-five hundred dollars for one operation? No, for three. Here, I'll show you my scar. There. Well, what do you know. A zipper and hemstitched. Yeah. Why the zipper? That's in case I need another operation. Very ingenious. Oh, think nothing of it. Quite brainy. Yeah. Hey. Cut it out. I got a good mind to let you... Go on. Now, go on, do your work. All right. Hey, you. Ow, ow, ow. Go pour me a cup of coffee. All right. Always hitting, kicking, doing that, everything. All right, Moe. He's one of those wise guys. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Hello? Oh, Joe. You got a hot one at Santa Anita in the third? Fine. Five across. That's five, five and five. Fifteen cents all together. Thanks. Goodbye. Here's your coffee. Oh, thanks. Say, Shemp, I need some more deductions. Got any ideas? Have you any bad debts? Yeah, I owe Uncle Jake $1500. Then deduct it from your income tax. How can I? I owe him. Do you expect to pay it? No. Then it's a bad debt. Smart thinking, boy, smart. Say, Shemp, how much you gonna deduct for dependents? Forty-four hundred dollars. That's 11 dependents. Who are they? My ex-wife and 10 bartenders. Why don't you quit kidding? Who's kidding? Why you... Oh! I'm sorry, kid. I apologize. Well, I don't accept your apology and don't do it again. All right, kid, I won't. But I will do this: Looks like a V8. Why don't you butt out of this? Why don't you quit hitting me? - Remind me to kill you later. - And no back talk. I'll fix you right now. Larry, wait, wait. Wait, put that down. I'll fix you. It's liable to go off. There. Look what you did to my hand. Oh, who cares about your hand... All right, get it off. I can't, that instant glue is stuck. Oh. My hair. Remind me to kill you later. Now, go get me a sandwich. And no back talk. Go on. Say, I ought to be taking some off for my car. Seven cents? Nah. Thirty-five cents a gallon of gas. Five... Uh, four... Uh... Hey, Shemp, how much is 100,000 times 7.5 cents? Thirty-nine dollars and 57.5 cents. Thanks. Hm. Oh, a drop of mustard. It's always good on a hot dog. Yes, a little drop of it and I know he'll like that. Hurry up with that sandwich. Maybe he'll want some mustard. Hey, Moe, here's your sandwich. And here I am. Hey, Shemp, give me a hand. Okay. Oh, boy. Packed us two slices and am I starved. I'll beat your brains out. Ah. Well, a little more mustard ought to straighten this out. Ah. There we are. Oh, a little too much. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ooh! I'll murder you. I'll murder you. Here, Fido, come back. Now I've seen everything. Hey, fellas, my hot dog ran away. Never mind that. I got a great idea. Listen: If we can save ourselves a fortune on our own taxes, why can't we do it for other people and make ourselves a pile of money? Certainly. We're natural-born tax experts. Yeah. Half of what we save our clients by gypping the tax collectors, we can keep. Yeah. Here's a toast to the new firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp, Tax Experts. Yeah. A toast to easy money. Hey, hey, hey, Moe. Why'd you call your shots? Always doing things to people. Let's see how you like it. Don't do it. I'm gonna... Serves you right. Next time you won't fool around like that. Say, you gentlemen have done very well with your income tax business. Beautiful home that you got here. Thank you, Mr. Cash, but we did all right for you too. Ja, that's right. You know, you are wonderful at inventing deductions. And how. We each made $100,000 last year. Is that so? And no taxes. No taxes? Well, that's good too. I didn't do badly myself. Hm? I'll say. Oh, uh, permit me. There we are. Hey, who put this measly 50 amongst my thousands? That's a dirty trick. That's a shame. Dinner is served, madam. Yes, Frances. Dinner everybody. Ladies. Oh, charming. Gentlemen. Sit right down. Right there is good. Oh, everything's so charming. Right over there, Mr. Cash. Oh, Larry, would you cut the turkey, please? Gladly, sis. Thank you. Ah, now, I will proceed to make my wonderful dressing. Pardon me. Do you mind, sir? No, no. Thank you. ♪ Ha-ha ♪ Just a few seconds, I'll be ready to serve. Ah, cayenne pepper. That's the stuff. And next we have the crumpet saud. Ah, crumpinella. I feel a draft in here. Would you like me to close the windows? Perhaps you better close your own. Well... I'll fix it, don't worry about it, I'll can it fixed. It's fixed. This is a beautiful bird. I'll be ready to serve in a few seconds. Gotta get this bone out so I can get the stuffing. Hey, Larry, that's quite a carving job you're doing on the turkey. Ah, this turkey looks wunderbar. I... Taste a piece, it's delicious too. Thank you very much. Mm, you are so right. I would... Uh, try one of these with the turkey. You very nice. Thank you. ♪ Arry-lay Ix-nay the eard-bay ♪ Mein Herr, would you like some salt? Oh, thank you. Oh... Oh, oh, oh. Oh, pardon me. He made a boo-boo. Yeah. I don't think we'll be able to eat this salad today. Oh, that's all right. I don't like vinni-minis anyways. Yes. Ja. I'm sorry about this. That's all right. Don't worry about a thing. You know, you boys really give a fellow wonderful service. Not only you are very good at evading, shall we say, income taxes, but you are wonderful hosts. Here. Oh, we're terrific. Yeah. Here, have some turkey. Yes, please. Could I have some salt? Oh, yeah. And some mustache? We don't have any mustache. A number six. A number six. Yeah, seven sideways. Yeah, oh, I love... Give him everything, Moe. Yeah, you got condimenties? There you are. I hope you like my lobster gumbo soup. I'll try anything once. Here, Frances, take this. I'm superstitious. No soup, thank you very much. You know, this gumbo is sure tough. I would... Ooh! I guess you have to dunk it. That's the way you have... This gumbo is alive. Or is it? I'll find out. By golly, it is alive. I'll fix that. Oh, you're going too far. Oh. You won't last long with me, I'll guarantee you that. Give me back my tie. Mm, I'll fix you. Oh, yeah? This'll do it. Come on. Come out, I dare you. Oh, I'm sorry, mein herring. I mean, mein Herr. You are very loose eater. Oh, boy, potatoes. Oh, that's a-one, a-two, three. Oh, and gravy. I loves gravy. Oh, boy. One.

What have you done with my beautiful beard? You idiots, you. I'm sorry, mein herring. I mean, mein Herr. I... Well, look what you've done, you've ruined a perfectly good $50 beard. Oh, a phony beard. Hey, what's the idea? I'm an officer of the income tax department. Okay, boys! We've been foxed. Maybe we can bribe them. You, uh... You men have ignored 20 summons from the department. We, therefore, place you under arrest on suspicion of falsifying income tax returns and defrauding the government. Oh, a double-crossing rat. Hey... Take that. Let's scram. Go get 'em, boys. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Before we get tough... Okay, you got us. Here! Come on, let's go. Hey, I know the back door is locked. All right, boys, let's get 'em. Now, listen, you. You're not... Why, I'll spaghetti you. No! Oh, a double-crossing rat. I'll get him. So you wanna get tough, eh? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
