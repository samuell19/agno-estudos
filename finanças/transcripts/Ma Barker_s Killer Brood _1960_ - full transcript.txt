(Screaming) It's gasoline! I never saw you before. I never did anything to you. Oh no, no. Please, I never did anything to anybody to deserve this. help! Help! Somebody! No stop! (Screaming) (Bell chiming) Nothing is accomplished by prayer alone. We need two things to build the Sunday school annex: the Lord's blessing and your contributions. The Lord has done his part. Now, let us see you do yours. While Deacon Thatcher and his assistants pass the collection trays, we will be honored by master Herman Barker, who will render Rock of Ages on his violin. (Rock of Ages playing) Well Ma, how did you like our little surprise? I was never so disgusted in my life. It sounded like a cat gobbling razor blades. I thought Herman played very well. I did. I didn't miss a note. And you didn't miss showing this town that we're raising a weakling. I was against wasting money on fiddle lessons. We need it for other things Music will give him character. It's making a sissy out of him and nothing disgusts me more than a sissy. I ain't a sissy, Ma! I clobbered a kid my size. Did you ever clobber anyone? No. But I could if I wanted to. Herman isn't a sissy, he's strong as the other boys. Oh, is that so? While Herman was sawing that fiddle in church, what was the other boys doing? Listening? Not on your life. Show 'em, boys... Where did you get these? Out of the collection plate, without anyone being the wiser. That took guts. How long has this been going on? Oh, a couple of weeks, it was their own idea. I thought it was kind of cute. Pretty slick, ey, pop? Last week we got over $1. What kind of a mother are you? Letting your son steal from church. Not letting them George, encouraging them. It's going to stop. No, it's going to continue, because I've decided that's the only way they'll ever have anything. What can you give them? An education. An education... You have one, what good did it do you? I live a decent life. A decent life? Do you call patch pants, garnered socks, in this run down fleabag a decent life? Well, we're in a depression, things will get better. You bet they will, because I'm teaching my kids to take what they want. I'd rather they were fiddle players than crooks. Fiddle players! Ma! They'll be fiddle players over my dead body. Go practice on that. Pa, look what she's done!. You're going to let her get away with that? He's just like you, a sissy that won't fight back. I tell you there's only one thing that's worth anything in this world and that's guts. I'm going to teach my kids to show plenty of 'em! Lloyd, look over by that box office and whistle if you see anybody coming. Gotcha. Herman, you'll get the money. How come I got to swipe the money? Because that's the way Ma planned it. And if you don't do what she said she's gonna beat the tar out of ya. I don't care, I don't want to do it. Alright, I'll do it. You do my job. Let's get going. (Singing) Charlie, will you stop kicking around here and hit the hay? We got to pull out of here tomorrow. Yes sir. The gang got me a whole handful that moon... Yes. Loaded with moonshine. Will you shut up and go to bed? Or I'll can ya right here on the spot. (Carousel music playing) Charlie! Turn off that merry-go-round. Hey, you little crook, come back here with that dough! Where are you taking me? To jail. Maybe the sheriff can get it out of you, who that other kid was. Gee, you think Herman would blab? He's kind of chicken. I don't know, we'd better get home and tell mom. Yeah... Honey. Why is it we're always at each other's throats? I guess we just think differently. You didn't used to. You are something special. What's that? The boys have come home. Coming home at this hour in the morning? Katie. What's going on here? Tomorrow's a school day. Why don't you leave my boys to me? We got the loot, Ma. The carnie caught him. We were lucky. We didn't get caught. What carnie? What loot? Where did you get the cashbox? Will you shut up and let me handle this? Where's Herman now? The Sheriff's dragged him to jail. You mean Herman let himself get caught? Carnie was too fast for him. The Sheriff's got him now. A lousy 56 bucks. Chicken feed. Did you know about this, Ma? Well, of course I knew about it. I cased the set up and helped them plan it. For the love of heaven, Ma, what are you making out of our boys? I ain't got time to argue with you. I got to get over to that sheriff's office and get Herman out. That's stealing. Just as sure's there's a God in heaven, Ma, you're going to be struck down for what you're teaching our sons. Ah, shut up. You're not going to town in that get-up? Well, what else would a worried mother wear when she reports her kidnapped son? Pop, can we go on and watch the fun? You boys get to bed. C'mon pop, we just want to have some fun. Get to bed. Shoulda asked Ma. She wears the pants in the family. It's all a mistake, Ma. This guy says I was in on a heist. A heist? What is that? Well, you know Ma, stealing. My goodness. I hope you don't think my boys have been stealing? That's right, lady. Where are your other boys, Mrs. Barker? Why, they're home in bed, of course. Been there all night? Why, certainly they have. They're growing boys. And I insisted they get to bed every night at 8:30. I don't know what got into Herman wandering around so late at night like this. How'd you know he'd be here? Well, I didn't know. I went into his room to see if he was covered up. He's had the sniffles you know, and he was gone. Not having a phone, not knowing which way to turn, I came running down here to see if you could help me. Look sheriff, I'm out 150 bucks and I want you to do something about it. My goodness, it don't seem like that carnival took in much business. How would you know, lady? That'll be enough you two. Mrs. Barker it's beginning to look like your boy is mixed up in the theft of this man's money. I don't see how that could be. I've always raised my sons to be honest and God-fearing. Why, they go to church every Sunday. I'm not interested in whether they go to church or not, Mrs. Barker. Fact of the matter is, your boys are under suspicion for several other robberies around here. That's a lie. That's a fact, Mrs. Barker. And if I hear about them being mixed up in anything else around here, I'm going to run you and your brood right out of town. Talk about police persecution. You're not the moral high ground. That'll be all Mrs. Barker, now take your brat and get outta here. You going to prosecute this little crook? On the evidence you've given me? What about this kid starting up my merry go round? Oh, by the way, my good man. Here's a quarter for my boys ride. I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful. What did I do? What did I do? What do you think, you numb-skull? You got caught, that's what you did. Doc was supposed to start the merry-go-round and you were supposed to take the money. I was scared, Ma. Next time, don't try to change the plans. I won't Ma, honest. Don't get caught. Don't worry Ma, I won't, ever again. Better not let Ma catch you with that fiddle. She said I could have it. She even said I could have a new one. Yeah, if you got enough guts to steal the money to get it. Alright boys, time for school. Ma, we got to go to school? Of course you do. You could write the principal we're sick. Let him think my kids are sickly? You could write that grandma was dead. Grandma was buried 10 years ago. So, what? We could dig her up and have another funeral. That ain't funny. This story in the newspaper isn't very funny either. Thieves broke into the office of the Wilder Carnival last night and made off with over $300. Cheapskate. Herman Barker, son of Mr. And Mrs. George Barker. You're famous. There it is, in black and white for the whole town to see. What's wrong with that? Says here they didn't have enough evidence. Sheriff can't pin anything on my boys. Herman is innocent. I've had enough of this. I'm going to give you boys a whipping that's long overdue. I'll show you who's head of this house. Katie, we're going to have an understanding right now. You bet we are. We are going to decide which way our boys are going. I've already decided. The way you're leading, they'll all wind up in prison! Not my boys. If I have to choose between dying in prison or dying in the poorhouse, there's not much choice between them. They chew so hard. What makes you so dead set against law and order? It's not the law I hate. It's living my whole life and growing old and die and never have anything, or seeing anything, or being anything. There's millions like us. I grew up in a family of 10 kids, wormy corn pone, watered gravy. Katie, the Bible says man does not live by bread alone but by...Stop it! That's why I was always so scrawny. Too much Bible, and too little beef. Too many songs, too little sow belly. I was sick of the litter. When I did get any dresses they was faded from washing, worn from wearing with frizzly hems from too much down. My toes played this little piggies through every cheap pair of cotton stockings I ever had. George, did you ever wear bloomers? Katie, we're talking about the boys. I'm talking about bloomers. My bloomers... Hand-me-downs from seven sisters. My playmates used to love to shove me down on the playground so my dress would fly up and you could see Old Homestead Flower written across my bottom. A girl doesn't forget those things. Katie, the soul can rise above any pain or shame. You mealy mouther. What good's a soul without a body to carry it around in? The body needs food. And food takes money. And how much money do you bring into this house? (Laughs) Jobs are scarce. The boys can steal more in one week than you can make in a month. Money isn't everything. Every time you do get a few bucks ahead, you spend it on a stupid thing like a boat or a dog or... There's nothing disgraceful about being poor. Some of our greatest Americans came from poverty. Take Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln, it won't be an Abraham. It'll be a 16 cylinder job that will take me out of this place at night. You wanted an understanding, well you're gonna get it. We don't need your chicken feet. We don't need you. So why don't you beat it! Why don't you take your things and get out? Pa, take me with you, please. Son, I'll send for you. Now, you say the Chinaman keeps his money here on the floor? Yeah Ma, it's in the barrel. Barrel? Yeah, you should hear him every time we go in there, he says: (fake Chinese) -Me go back to China. I got news for that Chinaman, he ain't going nowhere. Now, let's be serious. Well, boys, I... Boys, say goodbye to your father. We'll be seeing you. Have a good trip. Don't take any wooden nickels. You're just running us out of town cuz we're poor. I'm running out of town, Mrs. Barker, cuz you robbed the Chinaman, but I can't prove it. Worse than a bolsheviki. Just wait til I write my Congressman about you denying the rights of an honest citizen. A poor widow woman at that. Where will we go? I don't know Mrs. Barker, but the further the better. And don't you come back, because if you do I'll put you and your whole brood in jail. Sticks and stones may break our bones. Names will never hurt us. And so we drove into a future unprejudiced against childish pranks. Years past, and my boys grew into a fine young men. How was our rehearsal, Ma? It was lousy. Ma, we gonna do the job tomorrow? No, Doc, we're too rusty. We're gonna rehearse it a few more times. Look, I'm tired of rehearsing. Herman, you need it the most. As the armored car reaches this point, I come tearing out of here like I'm out of control. I cut in ahead of him. The guards kill you with machine guns fire. Now, who'd shoot an innocent old lady all alone in her car? Before they have recovered from their surprise... Herman comes in behind and blocks them. I jump out and shoot tear gas through that side port. When that front guard opens up, I let him have it. Herman? I go down the other side, when the driver gets out... Go on. Well, I knock him out. You kill him, Herm. And don't chicken out. Don't you worry about Herman. He may be squeamish but he always does his part. I steal the second car and drop the guard when he un- buttons the rear door. What if it doesn't open up, Doc? I grab the guard's keys, unlock the rear door. Swing it open, jump back. I spray the inside with a full clip. Us boys grab the money. We make our getaway as planned and rehearsed. Shoot him, Herman! Shoot him, Herman! Hello, Central? There's a hold up -- machine guns and everything. Right out there. Council and Madison. (Gun shots) Give us a hand! Give them a hand. I can't, Ma. I said give him a hand! There's the oil barrel. Give me that machine gun. You're drunk again, art. A gentlemen does not get drunk, he becomes inebriated. You're scum. Ma, when're you gonna get rid of this booze hound? He's harmless, besides, I'm married to him. Until death do us part. Hey, don't go giving me ideas. What do you want? I was wondering if I might have my portion of that King's ransom. Oh yeah, here's half a sawbuck. Go back down to the speakeasy and finish getting fried. Well, at least the tavern keeper is an articulate conversationalist. Yeah, just make sure you don't say nothing you shouldn't. That is Art, unless you want to wake up stone dead some day. Oh, my lips are sealed... Look, Ma, you're pretty smart. But that old coot, he's gonna get us in a jam one of these days, just you wait and see. Well, if I'm wrong about him, I'll get rid of him. Well, how much do you think we got? About 15,000. Well, you said we'd get about twice that much. Oh, stop crying. We got more than enough to get Freddy out of the big house. Get me an envelope. Hurry! You're not gonna send 10 grand through the mails are you Ma? Ah, of course not. Herman is taking it. Why me? Doc might spend it on dames. Lloyd might throw a party, and you haven't got the nerve to do anything unless I tell you! 10 grand, that makes Fred a little expensive. Makes us a little short, don't it? Don't fret. This is chicken feed compared to what we're going to get. You're planning the big one, Ma? Yep. And I'll tell you about it when I get good and ready. Now, I got to write Freddie and let him know he's getting sprung. You'd rather play with a mouse than read a letter from home? It's not a mouse, it's a hamster. Read the letter, might be good news. Chip... Connections. Put it away. Read the letter I'm getting sprung. Ma's already put up the money. I wish I had a Ma like that. She's throwing a big blow out for me when I get home. I'll be there. Stop dreaming, you got two years to go. Them coppers, they shorten your hitch for digging coal. Well the coal you could dig, I could stick in my ear. I got an organization. Lifers are digging for me. They're not going anywhere. I slip them candy, cigarettes, money. Al, Ma'd like you, you got brains. Yeah Freddy... But more important than brains, guts. What did you do that for? Everything squeals when it dies? Pigs, calves, people... I never heard a hamster squeal. Yeah... Like I said, Ma'd like you real good. Ma, what's, what's Machine gun Kelly doing coming here anyway? Well, it seems Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson did a pretty good job so Kelly wants me to plan a kidnap. A kidnap? That's crazy, Ma. The FBI, they'll ring us out like dish rags. We don't handle the body. Kelly takes that risk. Well, that's different. Hey, suppose you bring that living dog of a girlfriend with him? You lay off her. She's 10 cents a yard material. Beautiful. But stupid. But beautiful. But stupid. Now lay off of her, no dames. Honey, why give our good money to an old bag? I've already planned the deal. Ma's the best in the business. I'm as smart as Ma Barker. You know the trouble with you is, when you look at me all you think of is is this. You never take time to find out what's up here. Yeah, well. Let's see what Ma's price is. I hear she has body bag Fisher. Any fisherman knows he'll get stuck if he fools around with a hook. (Door knocks) Come in. Hi. Hello, Kelly. Oh, this is my girlfriend Lou. Oh. Well, pleased to meet you. Come on in. This is my boy, Doc. He's quite a ladies' man. Well, honey, let's get lost while Ma and Kelly talking business. Kelly... No wonder you like to take Lou with you wherever you go. I don't get you, Ma. She leaves really easy. You're much older than I thought. May I call you Grandma? I ain't a grandma yet. I keep my boys away from the likes of you. Ma sure topped you that time. Appears to me like Lou's the kind of a girl who's always getting topped. Let's get down to business. You want to plan a kidnap with a man named Jackson? How did you know that? Nevermind. You ain't got a dime. Well, he certainly has, he's a millionaire. His home is mortgaged, his car ain't paid for, he gets 20,000 a year and his wife's jewels are all in hock. I don't believe it. Oh, honey. Just because you had a few dates with him while his wife was out of town. That's a lie. She was there all the time. Yikes, some girlfriend you got Kelly. Ma, it was part of casing the job. Plan your job with fatter fish. How much? 50 grand. Why you old battle-axe, we wouldn't give you... Oh sweet child. You say that again, and I'll rattle your tonsils til that mink turns into the rabbit it is. I got no time for cheats or phony blondes. (Singing) Baby Face, I didn't know you knew Fran. Why, him and me was classmates at Kansas State. Did you get the dough we sent? Sure, how do you think I'm paying for this party? Machine Gun Kelly should have talked to you before he snatched Jackson. Oh, what happened? The guy didn't have a crying dime. What did you do with the skinny fish? I had to throw him back. See, he's here tonight. Well, there's lonely Davis, Vick and Homer Van Meter. Excuse me. I want to talk to somebody. I guess you heard we took a leaf from your book. Not my book. It ain't written yet. But when it is, it won't have a stupid chapter like that Jackson job you pulled. Can't a girl make one mistake? Like breathing? Honey, I'll still be around when you're worm bait. They'll have awful tough chew. Honey, I hope you won't feel out of place here tonight. Well, no. Why should I? I reckon you've never met any big shots. Oh, I've been around. Yeah, in circles. (Piano music playing) (Singing) Now how about Lloyd? (Singing) Don't lust for fur. You know, I'm kind of stuck on that fur. Well, if I have to work you over, you're gonna become mighty unstuck. Listen, you better take it easy fella. Big as you are, you got a long ways to fall. Look friend, nobody puts the rush on Machine Gun Kelly's girl. Now, now, Kelly, you want to shoot it out with Johnny Dillinger, you better go outside. Don't go messing around with my new furniture. Dillinger? You heard the name? Yeah, who hasn't? So you know what I was saying about my baby. I mean, a lot of guys make passes at her. And I bet you don't drop a single one. That's a good one, Johnny. Huh, baby? Well, that was close. Why'd Ma go and stop it? I would like to see a little action. Oh, you had enough, forever. And so have you. Watch it. I'll lay you 10 to 5 that Dillinger could take him without messing the hair. Al! So you made it. I told you I would. Ma, Ma, this is Al Carpus. Al Carpus, I'm glad to see you. Frank's told me a lot about you and if it's half as good as he says, you're okay in my book. What, did he tell you I was a fine upstanding citizen? Imagine this guy, when we were in prison, he organizes a Boy Scout troop to help him shovel coal, huh, Al? Yeah, yeah, they they did they're good turn. Have you located yet Al? No, no, no, not yet. Why don't you come in with us? Sure, we'd be glad to have you. Where are your boys, Ma? Oh, well there's Lloyd over there, and Doc and Herman are out on business. Except, they should have been back a long time ago. Fred, go get Al a drink. Step on it, kid, will ya? I am. Floorboard it! (Police sirens) What do we do if they catch us? Just forget it, Herman, hurry up, will you? Doc? Doc! Yeah. Yeah, they got us. Come on, I'll help you. No, no go on. I'll be right behind you. Ma's voice: Don't get caught. Don't get caught! Ma? Where's Herman? Cops get him? Is he hurt? Not anymore, Ma. He shot himself. Right, right to the head. Why'd he do a stupid thing like that? It was my fault. I always told him don't get caught. He wasn't as strong as my boys. My boy! When can I see him? Most likely tomorrow. Take him back home. But Ma, the sheriff told us never to come back. He better not show no objections to a mother going back home to bury her own! He is like a man which built a house and laid the foundation upon a rock. And when the flood rose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it. It was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth, against which the stream did beat, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great. To thy keeping, we commit the soul of Herman Barker, who of dust thou art made and to dust thou shalt return. Amen. Katie, this didn't have to happen. I know. If only you'd been a better father. (Phone ringing) Hello? Oh? Who told you? I see. No, we're leaving right now. Thanks a lot. Boys, get Arthur's bags and load everything back in the car. Why? Who was that, Ma? Big Biff said someone shot off his mouth at the speakeasy, and the cops know it was you with Herman. Oh, bourbon breath? Who else? Let me carve him, Ma. Not here. We'll stop for a little picnic between here and St. Paul. St. Paul, that the big one, Ma? Get those things lowered in there. I'll talk about it later. Well, Arthur, I'm gonna enjoy hearing you squeal. Yep, c'mon. Ma, you're the best cook that ever lived. Your turkey cooks moist, never dry. Yeah, Ma, she's pretty good on cooking gooses too. She even baked you a pie. Al, Ma's won prizes at the county fair. Not only for baking, for cooking too. Carve us up a piece of pie. No, thanks, I've had mine. Freddy. Lloyd? Why be so stingy with it? So you'll have time to eat. The others are larger. They'll be around longer. They didn't shoot off their mouths at the barn. Ma. I didn't. Don't you go trying to deny it. I told Al and the boys that if you shot off your bourbon mouth at that bar and got us in dodge, I was gonna finish you. I was gonna do something about it. Now finish your pie. Ma, you wouldn't do anything foolish, not to me? After all, I'm your husband. I'm just about to divorce you the quick way. I consider it a favor you let me do it. Let's draw straws. By right it's my job, I'm the oldest. Don't seem right you doing it, it being your own flesh and blood. Not ours Al, Ma found and married this guy about five years ago. I got a better idea, now gimme that gun. Russian Roulette. Ma, you are the slickest ever. Al, even money he gets it before the third shot. You got a $10 bet, Fred. No, Ma, no! I'll help you. Oh god, this is murder. You're pretty weak old man. Let me help you... Better luck next time. (Gunshot) You owe me 10 bucks. Wasn't worth it. Why not? Didn't have much chance to squeal. Nelson, you tell Davidson and Van Meter to do exactly what I planned. Where do we bring your cut? Listen, baby face, you show up around here and I'll kill you. You don't bring it, you send it. You wrap the amount I said in white paper and mail it to me. If we bring it up. You do it exactly like I planned it. My jobs always come off. Babies in this business. Carpus, Nelson and the others moved into the Sioux Falls bank. Right on schedule. Took their places right on schedule. The vault was opened right on schedule. Shooting the cop was not on the schedule. Everything's under control here. Take your time. They collected $50,000 and made their getaway right on schedule. I was right proud of them. It was nice of you to select our bank, Mrs. Henderson. Well, after Mr. Stilwell and the bank in St. Louis recommended you so highly, I just couldn't think of going to another bank. Since my dear, dead, departed husband. Drink this, Mrs. Henderson. We've all suffered the loss of a loved one. Thank you. I do hope I like St. Paul. Of course, living with my sister has its drawbacks. Her home's way out near the Hamlin School. My daughter attends Hamlin school. What a lovely child. Thank you. Now, how can we serve you? I would like to liquidate my holdings in St. Louis. and invest here in St. Paul. I see, well, our real estate department should be of service. Meanwhile, I'd like to have a safety deposit box. I'll have my secretary arrange that. You've been so kind. If there's anything you want Mrs. Henderson, I hope you'll think of our bank. I will, indeed I will. Alright, boys, here it is. This the surprise you're gonna spring, Ma? Nope. It's the commercial state bank. You're going off your rocker, Ma, it's the toughest bank in the country to crack. He's right mom, be lucky to get a handful of nickels out of that joint. Yeah. How about a boat? Who said anything about money? What are we going to do? Swipe the pins and blotters? Snatch... We're going to snatch the president. That's a federal rap, Ma, you want the FBI on our tail? I always told you, it takes guts to make a bundle. Like how much, Ma? 200,000. That's a lot of scratch Ma, it'll be red hot. Yeah, I've been craving for some cool cabins in Chicago, Miami, and Reno. Real raking from Alcatraz. Listen to me! On Monday morning, 10:15. You and Doc will leave this place. You will drive to the Hamlin school at the corner of Sixth and Washington. And pick up our diplomas. You will park on Sixth Street near the East entrance. Within three minutes, Courtney will arrive. You hope. He will. Because I'm going to call him and tell him his little girl is took sick at school and he's to come and get her. And he's gonna ask how sick is she? Nothing serious. Just an upset stomach. But we thought it best if she was home in bed. Have you called Mrs. Courtney? We tried to, but your phone is out of order. I see. Very well. I'll come and pick her up right away. Thank you. Miss Chase, I'll be back in about an hour. You must get a grip on yourself, Mrs. Courtney. If they harm him... They won't if you follow instructions explicitly. That's why you must take this phone call with as much calm as possible. It's after nine o'clock. I can't go through with it! Do something stupid, and failing... I thought when the FBI came in, they would handle everything. They must have your cooperation Mrs. Courtney. (Phone ringing) You will be fine. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Courtney. Now listen carefully, because I don't want to repeat myself. Put the money in a small package and put it at the end of the Front street wharf. Yes, is my husband alright? Don't worry about him. Just have the money ready. When I get to the wharf, what shall I do? A speed boat will come by, a man will call your name. Give him the money. Yes, I will. Please don't hurt him. We... I need him so. You can have him. We're honorable people, Mrs. Courtney. Keep your word, we'll keep ours. Relax, Ma. Worrying won't help. According to the schedule, they're two hours overdue. So they had a flat They'll be here. It don't take two hours to fix a flat, besides, they had three spare tires just in case. Listen, Ma. Ain't our car, I can tell by the sound. You go in the house, you know what to do. (Whistling) You here all alone? Sure looks like it, don't it? How did you know where to find us? We heard some rumors, Ma. We put two and two together. Cut out the hearts and flowers. Ma, we knew this was your job. We know how you work. Alright, boys. Lou, are you pulling another Jackson Boehner? I bubbled that, but this time I've got you out- smarted. Oh, my, it does look bad, don't it? What's your proposition? We kind of figured to take Courtney off your hands, Ma. Are you offering any cash? Of course we are. Lou figured we'd pay about... Not one red cent. But honey, you said 50 grand! That was before we found Ma alone. I never heard of such a thing, trying to steal another mob's kidnap. Why, it ain't honest. You're in no spot to refuse, Ma. Do you want to gamble on that? Can you beat four of a kind? Depends on how big they are. I'd call them aces. Oh, honey, you've never been known to be very bright. Looks more like Jokers to me. You're slipping. A Joker is still an ace. Not in Texas poker. We strip out the Joker. And that's just what I'm going to do with your hot hand. Fred! That's a pretty low card, Ma. Maybe I oughta draw another. Carpus! You better draw your limit, Ma. And fast. I'm losing patience. Baby Face Nelson. And a friend in Carpus and baby face and me ain't enough, then I got a wild card. A real wild card. Johnny Dillinger. 5s beat 4s. I'd say Ma has the best hand. After this, folks will be calling you Pop Gun Kelly. Yeah, they sure will, Ma. Like I always said, you're the best in the business. I bet you do, Kelly. Boys put up your hardware. You mean lay down their hardware, don't you? Well, I guess we can't do business so we'll be on our way. Now, is that any way for a guest to act? You'll stay for dinner. Pick up those boys' guns. They're getting right and dusty laying there on the ground. Why did you do that? Well, I saw it move and I didn't want it to bite you. What's he doing here, Ma? Kelly heard that we kidnapped somebody. I declare, I don't know how those rumors get around. Kidnapped? That's a laugh. You get the letters like I told you? Yeah, it's in the backseat. Good, take the car around in back, and put the letters in the icebox. We'll have some for supper... Darling. These are the nice men I told you about. A. Bruiser. Stravary. Baxter. Mr. Baxter. I know you've had a harrowing experience, Mr. Courtney so I'll be as brief as possible. Thank you, I am very tired. Do you have any idea of who your abductors were? I was blindfolded the whole time and they only talked in whispers in my presence. Can you tell us where they took you? No, I can't. Can you estimate the length of time you traveled? It was hours. 4, 5, 8? Well, I'd say roughly about eight hours. Do you recall any unusual sounds? No. Just the incessant whirl of the tires on the highway. And we'd been traveling for about six hours and the sound change changed. To what? The way tires sound when you're driving on wet pavement. Rain, within a radius of 300 miles. We'll check on that. Can you tell us when they stopped for gas? They didn't. That is, not at the filling station. Before we hit the wet pavement, they turned off on a side road, poured gas into the tank on metal container. I could hear them toss the can to the side of the road. Very good, Mr. Courtney. I was placed in a cellar basement, I think it was very damp. I could hear cows, ducks, chickens. A lot of hammering. I could hear a railroad train several times a day. How far away was the sound? Seemed to be about two miles away. Well, this gives us something concrete to work on. Thank you very much, Mr. Courtney. If we need any further information, we'll be in touch with you. Thank you, sir. Good night, Mrs. Courtney. Good night. Good night. Darling were they rough with you? No, they treated me well. I had water and cigars. Did they feed you? Are you hungry? That's the only part of the whole thing I really enjoyed. Enjoyed? The meals. That cook served the best food I've ever tasted. I wish I had one of those cherry pies right now. This is the only place it rained that day. I want the area covered. We'll use as many men as necessary. Find the road where that car pulled off to put in gas, and there we should find that empty gas can. Reading about you in the paper. It's a good picture too. Then you know we're in real trouble, Doc. So you get your tools because you got a little operation to do. What kind of operation? You'll find out soon enough. Maybe plastic surgery. I haven't done any plastic surgery for years. Well, you're going to do one now. Maybe you'll get that old diploma back, Doc. Now get your tools. Look, my hands. Take something for them, and do it fast will ya? Because when Ma gets here, she won't like it if you botch this job. Now get your tools. Oh Doc, you're getting to be a real rump pot. Look, Ma, you better get somebody else. My nerves are shocked, besides I never specialized in surgery. Oh, take a good big drink. Don't get bolted. I love my boy, and if you don't do a good job, I'll give you the same operation without ether. This is no time for jokes. I haven't told a joke in 20 years. Ma, is this gonna hurt? No son, no. He's gonna put you to sleep and when you come to it'll all be over... Ma, I don't mind about the fingerprints, but do I have to change the face? Every post office in this country has a picture of your face. Now don't you worry, don't you worry. Your mom will take care of you, just like she always does. You butcher, you're hurting my boy. Give me another slug. You had enough. You're cutting deep. You want to take over? Old Doc Gottfried, sop to the underworld. Stop it, you're hurting my boy. Give him some more ether. Ya know, Ma, that's pretty funny. I used it all. You're hurting him. Well, let him hurt! You talk about your boys having guts, well let him hurt. Hey, Doc said to take it easy. Am I hurting my own son? You're doing fine. Hey, you know if I like what that Doc did, I'm gonna have him make me look like Valentino. Ah, my fingers! Sorry son, I'll take it easy. What's wrong, Ma? What did he do to me? Did nothing, not a thing. You mean I look just like I did? He let you suffer all those weeks for nothing. That dirty, stinking butcher! No no, no, no, please I never did anything to anybody to deserve this. It's Ma, Ma Barker. Please, Mr. I'll get lost, anything. Help! I'm burning! Stop! No! How could they be sure this was Dr. Gelfie? Well, his wallet wasn't burned. And the initials on the back of his watch, it's pretty conclusive. How do you interpret this? Gangland vendetta? If his medical services were so valuable to the underworld, why would they rub him out? He was on the schiz, or parrot fever? Yacking too much. Could have been the Barker gang. Went to Dr. Gelfie for a face lifting and rubbed him out so there'd be no witnesses. Do you think the Barker gang would engage in this sort of thing? Why not? This is the work of animals. They're all animals when they're on the run. And there's a chance some members of the gang may have had their features altered so we won't be able to recognize them. Well, they may alter their features, but they very seldom change their habits. Sooner or later. One of them will tip his hand. Yeah? Nelson. Hi, Nelson. Hi, Kelly. Where's Dillinger and Van Meter? They couldn't make it. Want a drink? Yeah. Where's Lou? Taking a bath, she'll be out in a second. What's on your mind? The biggest kidnap in history. You will have to go some to beat the Barker job. Do you figure a quarter of a million dollars will beat it? It might if it comes off. Who set it up? We did. You're kidding. After that Jackson coop, you couldn't cop a bag of marbles at a dime store. We tried to get Ma Barker to mastermind the job, but she wants 50 G's. It's worth it. In advance? I've got a better idea. I'll get Doc Barker. Yeah? And he's just as smart as Ma. And a lot cheaper. But the G needs an M, you can't get him. I'll get him. Yeah, maybe you will at that. And I'll get even with Ma Barker and the bargain. Honey, will you help us? Honey, I'm still hot from that Courtney job. Oh, think of the fun we could have. Are you kidding? You know Kelly would never go for this arrangement. And Ma, Ma, she would skin me alive. Hook me. Honey, it's so hot. Can I tell Kelly you're in? All the way. I've had my eye on you for a long time, Doc. Zip me...Don't leave. I'm just going to call Kelly. Well, don't you tell him that I agreed. I'll tell him you'll give him an answer next week. I'll be right back. Did you forget your nickel, hon? You don't have to knock. We've always been told it was the right thing to do. Thought you was somebody else. Obviously, at this point we usually frisk for concealed weapons, but I think we can waive the procedure this time. You've been entertaining, Doc? Who's Doc? My name is Austin Bennett. Well, at least the initials are the same. Stretch out and be comfortable. Wasn't that Machine Gun Kelly's girl that just left. Look, you guys, you just can't barge in here like this with your guns drawn and call me false names and accuse me of playing around with Lou. Oh, is that her name? We didn't know. Look, who'd you guys mistake me for anyway. Huh? Has anyone ever confused you with Doc Barker? The notorious robber and kidnapper? Doc Barker? No, I never heard of that guy. I'm sorry. Now, can I get dressed? Too hot, stay comfortable? Got a search warrant? You know, it's illegal to read somebody's private mail. If you'd care to dress and come down to headquarters with us to press charges. Well, I ought to, just on principle. Listen to this. You get a kick out of Ma, she spends all her time feeding Old Joe the alligator. This is as good as a map. Where's the envelope? There wasn't an envelope. Fred's rich now, you know, he sent that by text. All the way from Florida? Montana. What's a Florida alligator doing in Montana? Maybe he fell in love with a buffalo? Now, look, you guys are wasting your time. I'm gonna get dressed. Either you book me or let me go. Alright, get dressed. We'll take you with the stock. I'll leave a little note. You do that. In the meantime, I'll get out of general bulletin to all alligator farms and tourist courts to look out for an alligator named Joe. Boy. You guys sure throw the taxpayers money around, don't you? True. True. Why, even right now I'm planning to spend some on a train trip to Florida. Cause I got a strong hunch, I'll find me a Barker named Fred. An alligator named Joe, and a werewolf named Ma. We worked hard so the stockholders declared the dividend. Split the 200,000 and scattered. Fred and I chose Florida. It's so lovely in winter. How was your walk? Lousy. What's the matter with you son? You've been moody for days. Ma, you always wanted to be somebody and have a lot of money. Okay, you got both. Why don't we quit? I always kind of hoped to retire. Might be kind of fun at that. Traveling first class, living good. Giving my grandkids a ride on my foot. Let's do it mom. (Phone ringing) That's my call to Doc. Hello? Oh yes, operator. What? He checked out? When? A week ago...Did he leave a message? Any forwarding address? I see. Thank you. Fred! Fred, they got him! The stinking cops! Oh, you know Doc, it's some dame. It is not, they got him. Otherwise he would have given me a message. Get packing... That's the place. Let's move in. Against the Barkers, you move by inches, on your belly. We'll wait, we got a carload of agents coming up. You can't make a reputation that way. No, newspaper publicity wouldn't hurt come next election. They're loading suitcases into the car. Cover that shack over there. The deputy can work his way into those weeds out front. Avery and I will take the side and the back. Give us five minutes. What if they move out before you get into position? Well, the closest men take them. Don't trust them. Stay low and shoot straight. Car loaded? Well, get moving. I smell cops. Ma, I'm tired of running. It's run for safety or walk to the hot seat. Either way, we keep moving. Fred, Ma Barker, we're officers of the Department of Justice. We want you to come out one at a time. Unless you come out, we'll use tear gas to force you out. Get out. My finger's still swollen. Ma, we don't, we don't have a chance! Oh, yes we have! It's either shoot our way out of here or rot in prison. You hear us, Ma? You can't surround a house with one man. Sound it off, men. Ready? Okay, team, ready. In place. Real tricky. Four men trying to sound like eight. Four to two Ma, we haven't got a chance. I'm gonna quit. Wait a minute, listen, there's one man up front in the weeds. Another one outside here in the shed. I got an idea. They're up to something. We should have split one and one with the local law. Those boys don't know how tricky Ma can be. Too late to do anything about that now. Boys, you wouldn't shoot...Put up your hands! Fred's got a gun on my back. Can you imagine that? My own flesh and blood using me for a field. Drop it, Fred. Looks like they got us. We got the Barkers! (Gun fire) If that means what I think it does, the odds are even now. It's all over. It's all over. Not without a fight, it's toe to toe! I'll work around and cover the front. Let's make a simp out of this place. I gotta quit. Back to the window while I change this clip. Please give up. If we surrender at least we'll be alive. You gutless hunk, you're as yellow as your old man. (Gun fire) We're gonna get killed. Stop shaking, and start shooting. Ma, I'm quitting. Stop you blubbering or I'll kill you myself! Ma, you don't know what you're saying. You've gone crazy! I'd rather see my son's dead than know that one of them was a coward. Fred? Son? Freddy....Oh, Freddy! They was against us, they was always against us. Don't you see? We had to fight. I'm going to go out fighting the whole damn world! I'll kill you, you butchers! I'll kill you! Didn't know the old witch, you'd swear she was just somebody's sweet old grandmother. Like the wolf in Red Riding Hood. Epitaphs of the turbulent 30s. Suicide to avoid capture, Herman Barker. Killed resisting arrest, Ma Barker, Fred Barker. Killed trying to escape Alcatraz, Doc Barker. Murdered by a jealous girlfriend, Lloyd Barker. Sentenced to life imprisonment Alvin Carpus, Machine Gun Kelly. For as a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. None left his mark. Each left his stain.
