Clear, guys. Let's standby. Hey! What's wrong with you? Hot babe. Come over. Bye! Hurry up! Get in! I'm letting you guys know nicely. Next time you do this kind of things, count me out. I'm telling you. I don't want to do it. I can't stand it. Just zip your mouth, Zakiah, and strip the car down... ...before we do it to you. You've crossed the line, Baldy. Watch your mouth. As they say, age doesn't equate intelligence. Ki, you should watch what you say. She is a woman. Fine! If she's a woman, prove it then. Hurry! -Come here, Baldy. I'll show you. Zack! And you too, Aki. What is this? No matter what, she's still a woman. Have some respect, man. I'm tired. Come on, stop fighting. Today is a happy day. We made it! Applause! Incoming call! Boss! Boss! -Boss. Boss. You want some too? Boss, you got a call. What is it? -It's your mother! My mother..... It's your mother! Stop! Be quiet! Hold on! Move aside. Hello, mom. Check the switch board. Let's go together. Hurry up. You know Ray. Nice cake. Where did you buy it? Hey, my man! High five! -High five. I'm on my way home. I'll be there in a while. Mom, you're treating me like a child. Please don't worry. Okay. I love you, ma. Okay. Listen up. Tomorrow we're going to rattle Kota Bharu. We're going to look for Pak Ya, Harun Biawak... ...and Lan Boroi. They haven't paid their debt. If they still don't pay by tomorrow, cut them off. Okay? -Yes, boss. Here. Let's go. -Boss. There's one more. -Who? Karim. Okay, find him too because I've something to discuss with him. Okay? -Yes, boss. Now get lost. Don't disturb him. Your uncle is watching the television. Go to mom. And you, Ray. You should try controlling your temper. Arisha is just a child. Don't take it to heart. You know that I don't like children. Just wait until you have your own child. Then you will understand. With that kind of attitude, it's better not to have children. Even better, avoid marriage altogether. I'm not trying to force you,... ...but if possible, I'd like to see you settle down soon. We have no one. Only us two brothers. And you're already well into your thirties. How's your workshop? It's okay. That's great. I heard that your workshop is doing better now. There's been a lot of luxury cars coming in. Nowadays you hear about stolen luxury cars every day. I hope you're not involved. Your tone is accusatory. I'm just warning you against it. It's late. -Yes. The baby's already asleep and Arisha has school tomorrow. Ray, I'm leaving. Can't I hug my own little brother? Ray, there's something I want you to remember. Blood is thicker than water. We can't change the past. But we can still try to fix the future. Let's go. How long does Ray plan to carry on like that? That's the way he is. Since he was small, he has put the blame on my late parents... ...for sending him to the juvenile school. So he rebelled. But I know,... ...that he has a good heart. He can act as rebellious as he wants towards you,... ...but he shouldn't do it in front of the children. They don't know anything. That's enough. Let's not think too much about Ray. Eventually he'll be all right. What we should do now, is try to win his heart. Honey! Hey! Are you drunk? Thank God my wife and children are okay. Sorry, brother. My friend was experiencing micro sleep. He closed his eyes, was supposed to be for a while,... ...but it went longer than expected. And you suddenly showed up. It was unintentional. Sorry. -Don't joke about this. Had something bad happened, I would've killed you. Get out! He's mad. Is he mad? Okay. In that case, I will give you two choices. Leave or..... This is called a..... This is called a..... The children are fine. Let's go home. Scared, aren't you? They're scared. Honey, leave it. Let's go. What should we do? What happened to them? -They got hit. So what should we do? Scram. Hey! Get in the car! Hurry up! Mom! Dad! I didn't get to apologise to him. And I have wronged him a lot of times. Now..... Be strong. This is what you call fate. When my parents passed away, I was in juvenile school. Don't you think that fate has been very harsh towards me? Hey! Don't say that. Everything happens for a reason. That's easy for you to say. So do you want to die? Go ahead and die. Come on. Appreciate what you still have. Okay. I'm leaving. -Where to? My friend invited me to talk about business. He said he wanted to hear my views. At this hour? -Yes. Damn! Why am I so unlucky tonight? Karim,... ...you get mad at others when you lose. ...you get mad at others when you lose. Don't play if you don't have money. You think I have no money? For heaven's sake, my father prints money for a living! Hurry up and give it to me. -Hurry up. Come with me. A gangster. You don't know who I am. Do you know Red Hill? It was me who painted it with blood. Do you know the Dead Sea? -Sure I do. Why? I'm the one who killed it. Get him. Come and sit here. He must have neglected paying his debt. Boss. -Move a bit. Boss, here. Be patient, boss. That hurts. Is there someone in here? Unfortunately, yes. There's someone there. Hey, Karim, when are you going to pay your debt to me? You said you wanted to pay in December. But now it's already the month of... ...January. It's not that much. Only RM 50,000. You're too much. Yes I did promise to pay in December. But did I say what year? No, right? So, just chill, will you? Yes, that's about right. Tell me when you're going to pay what you owed me, right now. Okay! Fine! Give me two days. Everything will be settled. Don't be too rude. You're still a kid! -Okay. No need to scream. What's this? -Take it. I'm sorry, Karim. I used the wrong intonation on you. Move aside. Please have a seat, sir. Okay. If you don't want to pay my debt, it's okay. I have another way. Is it possible? Don't ever dream that I will ever work for you. Please. No, you can't work for me. That's so brainless. I just want you to talk your friend into fighting under me. Under my management. Can you? Just keep it to yourself. Ray doesn't like to fight under any management. He's a freelancer. Got it? -Got it. That's enough. Don't worry. Now get up. -Get up? Okay, never mind then. You can go home, Karim. Hey! The two of you! Take Karim out with respect. -Alright, boss. With respect, okay? -Okay. Respect. Get moving. You're lucky I'm not in the mood to beat up anyone today. If not, you two would have been dead. My waist! Let's go. Bob! Help me out, Bob. It won't take long. Yes? Do you want a spanner? Do you want my elbow on your face? What? I said, go away! Keep it down! Can't you see that I'm taking a break? So noisy! Don't make me give each of you a flying kick. You're all talk but deep down you're scared. Hey, watch what you say. All my ancestors died on a battlefield. My grandfather died in the Second World War. He had to quit his job early because he only had one leg. One leg? Was he hit by a bomb? No. -Then? He had diabetes. -Damn. Diabetes? Peace be with you. Peace be with you too. Ray. Something good showed up. What is it, Karim? Did you manage to steal something new again? What are you talking about? Down there,... ...there's a pretty woman. Actually, I'm Mr. Rahimi's lawyer. I'm here to execute his will... ...to give the custody of these children to you. Based on my initial assessment,... ...I think you are capable of taking care of these children. Do you hear me? Go on, please. Can you take care of the children? Do you like them? Yes. I do like children. I was supposed to open a kindergarten... ...but I didn't have enough money, so I opened a workshop. That's good then. This is the custody form that you have to fill. I will come once a week to see if... ...you can really take good care of them. Every week? What day? I can't tell you because it will be a surprise visit. I love surprises. So, from now on, the children will be... ...under your responsibility and you're going to be their new dad. I hope you can take good care of them. Why did you agree to take in the children? This is all a disaster. I don't know what I was thinking. Is it hard to look after children? Not so, right? They're still small. You can do it. That's right. They're just kids. That's right. You don't know these kids. They can make you go crazy. Don't believe me? Just give it a minute. They can make us go crazy? Like how? Sorry, my bad. My bad? Do you think that thing is cheap? See? It's not broken. I don't mind if you want to take care of the children. But when the little one is bawling like right now,... ...do you know what to do? What's so hard about that? Just give him some milk. Like I said, just give him some milk. What milk? -Yours! Are you nuts? Take this RM 500. Use it. What is this money for? You give out money every time you have some. Keep it. Yesterday, I won the lottery at the black market. Take it. There's no need. Keep it. Praise be to God. Hey, Ray. I have something to ask you. Are you really serious about taking care of the kids? You don't like kids. They are my late brother's children. Like it or not, I'll have to try. You're too loud! Showing off, aren't you? Look at these kids. They think they're good. They will learn when you smoke them in a race. Cocky kids. Drink up first. -I'm so mad. Just a bit more. Finish it up. Finished? -Yes. What are you doing here? I just want to look. You can't enter this room. If Ray finds out, you will be in trouble. Ray, I'm leaving. Don't die in your sleep Bye. Be quiet. Where did you go? You got back late. We raced a Skyline. Some young punks showed off in front of Zaki. He got really mad. So, we gave them what they deserved. Good. Let's go home. I feel sorry for the kids. Where are they? The little one's asleep. The sister's maybe in the toilet. Let's go. -Let's. Thank goodness Ray didn't see you. Otherwise he would have roasted you. Let's go home. The milk here is very expensive. I don't have enough money. Why don't you just drink condensed milk? It will be easier. Let's find some diapers for you. Yes, uncle? What are you looking for? When did I marry your aunt? I'm looking for diapers. Adult diapers are over there, sir. We have it in all sizes. We even have your size. You got it all wrong. It's not for me. I can still get myself to toilet. It's for him. I'm sorry, uncle. Wait here. I will get it for you. Zaki! What? -Yesterday I had a dream. I was driving my old car. I was enjoying taking... ...the laps left and right when suddenly I had an accident. Do you think it will be the winning number today? Give me a piece of paper and a pen. I'll take a look at it. What's the registration number of your old ride? It's not nice. You're out of luck. It won't work. Get down. What do you want to be? I want to be a princess. -Princess? What princess? You've been nothing but trouble! You're not a princess and you will never be one! No, my mum always said that I'm a princess. So your mum said that you were a princess. That's why the princess rides in the car. This car, right? Your mum gave this to you? Did your mother give you this car? Did she? What's going on? I'm going out for a meal. We're all going out for a meal. You stay here and tidy up the workshop. I don't want to see even a speckle of dust left. Okay, princess? Be patient, boss. She's just a child. Listen to me, kid. Clean up my desk too. I'm sorry, Princess. It's like this. I think,... ...if you don't want to take care of the children anymore,... ...just send them to a place where... ...there would someone who would love them. What do you mean? Hey, Ray. What Bob means is,... What Bob means is,... ...if you can't give love to the kids, send them to an orphanage. Then they won't be so miserable. The children are orphans, boss. They only have you. You guys look like you have never been to school... ...but you do have a brain, especially this one. That's a very basic thing, boss. Do we need to tell you that? Oh, no! Where's the kid? Pablo? You want this? This is my child. Thank you very much. This boy really likes to roam around. What a nuisance. Thank you. That boy is really cute. Whose child is he? Where did the kid come from? From there. -Why did he come to you? He hugged me. Who's the woman? His mother maybe. Right. Then it's the mother's son. Where's the little one? -Asleep. Say a prayer before meal. If we don't recite the prayer, we'll be eating with the devil. The devil doesn't eat rice. Come on, Ray. Recite the prayer. Me? You should do it. You're older. Where did you learn your religion? The old has to recite the prayer? You recite it. -Are you telling me what to do? Just admit that you don't know. You're at this age and you don't know the prayer before a meal? In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. Oh Allah, bless us with what You have... ...given us and protect us from hell fire. Amen. -Amen. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to send you to school. Are you serious? Thank you so much, daddy. I'm sorry, uncle. Thank you for taking care of Arisha's school registration. It's all right. It's my duty, after all. Tell me a bit about yourself. About what? Something like what you like or your hobby. He likes to fight. Fight? -Yes. Silat, tekwando. You? -Me? Actually, I like to sing. At the same time, I'm an animal lover. I like cats. -What? Cats? -Yes. Yes! I like cats too. You like cats too? How many do you have? Four are already dead. Where do you come from? Pasir Mas, Kelantan. I haven't gone home in a long while. I don't even speak Kelantanese. That's right. Uncle didn't even go home when grandpa and grandma passed away. What are you guys doing? I was only gone for a second and this happened! Arisha, stop. Go and wash your hands. Come and wash your hands. What is this? Your feet are so dirty! Do you think this is your father's house? All these. What is all these? What's this? Did your father pay for this carpet? Give me this. Why didn't you die along with your father? You're nothing but trouble for me. Look. Look. What? I'm bad? Yes, I'm bad. Only your father and your mother are good. I'm bad? Yes, I'm bad! Wait there, Aidil! -Everyone liked your father. Ray, come on, stop it. She's just a child. She made me lose my temper. It's okay. Go in! Serves you right. Take that! Hey, Ray! Come on, man. Go! Karim's not here, boss. You're right. Why do you think he's not here? -I don't know. Because he knows that we're here. That's enough, Ray. Remember God. Restrain yourself. You're going to kill him. Disqualified! Out! Now I understand why Karim often comes here. It's quite lucrative. Let's ask boss when will he fight again. Another one hits the dust. Funny. Why do you think he won? I don't know, boss. Because he's strong. He can finish five servings at one sitting. I want Karim! Karim! -Yes, boss. Thank you, Mr. Ray. We will look after the children... ...like we look after our own children. That's good. Praise be to God. Thank you. God willing,... ...we will raise them to succeed in this world and the next. That's good. Come here and take a look! We have new kids and they're so cute. Seems like we're going to get a lot of money. I'm sorry, Mr. Ray. The children get excited when people come and donate. They're feeling grateful for God's gift. Daddy! The house feels empty, right? Where are you going? Eat your dinner first. I'm going to sleep. You have to sleep too. We have a job tomorrow. Whose car are we going to steal tomorrow? That's why. We held a meeting but you didn't come. You're always giving excuses. Come and eat first! You have a heart of stone, Ray. You can't do this. Yesterday you promised that if I won, I would get the car. But when you lost, you refused to hand it over. He wants our car. The car that you want is my car. But you've promised. Let me tell you, next time, if you want to do this,... ...make sure you draft an agreement letter. Only then you can claim my car. -Boss! Are you talking about a game? Why didn't you tell me? When will it be? Hold on! Who are you? I'm Mail Seknopak. I'm famous in Kota Bharu. How could you not know me? Anyone who wants to play this game will call me. I can take care of everything. I've never seen someone like you. With your rasta outfit. Who are you? This is the latest fashion in the car world. Did you just come out of the cave? Your car! -Someone's stealing my car! Where's the key? Hurry! Oh no! -You failed! My car! I hope he dies. Let's leave. Don't waste our time here. Let's just leave him like that. Come here and take a look at that. We got new kids and they're cute. We're going to make more money after this. Peace be with you. -Peace be with you too. Where are the children? They're not here. Not here? Where did they go? Hell. -They went to hell? Please. Please. I'm sorry. -How could you? Although I am ignorant,... ...I never do the things that you do. I promise I won't do it anymore. It's not me that you have to apologise to. Mr. Karim. Stop smoking. Ray is lucky. Otherwise, we're all finished! Thank God he didn't die. Where's Ray? -How would I know? Ms. Lisa is here. How are you? What actually happened? What's finished? All right, I'll tell you. Actually, Ray doesn't like kids. Not just those kids, but all kids. He hates kids. What? Is this true? It's true. Why would I lie to you? Even the kids don't like him. You're good at lying, aren't you, Mr. Karim? What do you mean I'm lying? Hi! -Praise be to Allah! Thank you for taking care of these children, Ustazah. You're welcome, God willing, we'll take good care of them. Thank you. Let's go. -Arisha, say goodbye. Bye. -Say goodbye. They think of you as their hero. Just them? What about you? When will you think of me as your hero? No, no. Oh no, the number is the other way around. You're Karim's friend. Why? What do you want? I'm looking for him. -Look for him yourself. Where's Karim? I don't know. Find him yourself. I won't tell you where he is. We're brothers. I can't tell you. I won't tell even if you kill me. Alley 16, Rayyan Workshop, there's a dead end... ...next to Ah Tong's store and in front of it,... ...there's a 24 hour laundry service. He's there. Go find him there. Thank you. I hope this number will help me win. If I don't win, I'll throw you away, hand phone. Karim! It's me, Pablo. Come here. I'm here to collect your debt. What's going on? Be quiet. There are bad guys around. Be quiet. Do the bad guys come to service their car? No. Bad people's car breaks down too, right? Ouch! That hurts! You're hurting my hand. You're hurting me. How did you know about this place? I'm broke. I'll pay once I have money. I'm completely broke right now. Check his pockets. Ouch! Don't pinch me! That hurts, you fool! Anything? Yes. It feels like the rambutan fruit. -What? That's not rambutan, you fool! My pocket is torn! That was painful. When are you going to pay me? When I have the money. Okay. Lift him. Lift him. Don't be afraid. My armpit! To the count of seven, six... To the count of seven, six... ...five,... ...four,... ...three,... ...three,... ...two,... ...one..... Who threw this? You! -Don't hurt my daddy! Blood! I'm badly hurt! Hospital! Hurry! Hurry! Where is Arisha? She's awfully late. Let's ask the guard. Let's go. Sir? -Yes? Have you seen my daughter? She's seven years old. Is she your daughter? If I'm asking, of course, it's my daughter. As far as I know, all the pupils have left. There's no one left at the school. How do you do your work? I haven't picked her up. Don't you mess with me. If she goes missing, you will pay for it. It's true, sir. Why don't you go and look? You! -Ray, Ray. I'm worried, Ray. Actually, Pablo and his men came to ask me to pay at the workshop. Then..... Hey! What are you looking at? Hey! What are you looking at? I'll gouge your eyes out! Sorry. Then Arisha came to my rescue. Another thing, he wanted me to convince you... ...to fight under his management team. But don't, Ray. Why didn't you tell me? I know it's my fault. I'm sorry, Ray. Where do they hang out? At this time, they normally hang out at their old place. Ray! Ray, don't go! Ray! You're so stubborn! Where's my daughter? How would I know? Where's my daughter? I swear I don't know who your daughter is. It's fun to play with the colourful balloons, right? Peace be with you! What happened, boss? You look terrible. Did you go and fight at the alley again? It's like this, boss. His mother wanted to meet this girl, so we took her there. You two really don't have any brain. I went all over looking for this girl. You should tell us if you're going anywhere. Why did he hit me? Come here. Come here, don't be afraid. Come, come. Are you afraid of me? Are you afraid of me or not? Hit me! Hit me! So you are afraid of me. How dare he hit me. My name... ...is Pablo. And you can call me... ...anytime. A bit more. Okay. One, two, three! -Surprise! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to Arisha. Happy birthday to you. Let's cut your cake. It's finished. Where's Daddy Ray? Daddy Ray? There he is. -You got a new car. You got a car. -A red car. Oh my God! -Do you have a license? You're old, Ray. You're going to ruin the car. Faster, Arisha! You're driving so slowly. Can I cut it? -Sure. I'm hurting. It hurts. Daddy. May I talk to Arisha's father? I'm her father. Me! Me! Me. Me. -No, me. No way. -It's me. Actually, we're all Arisha's dads. Okay, it's like this. Arisha is suffering from liver complications. Her liver is damaged. So right now, we need a liver donor for her. I'll donate mine. -Me too! Me too! Among us all, I'm the healthiest. I'm willing to donate too. No one can simply donate an organ. You need to be healthy, your blood type must match hers. A CT scan will have to be done first. Check us all, doctor. Okay, in that case,... ...you can go home for now. Come back tomorrow for a blood test. Can you? Tomorrow? Thank you, doctor. -You're welcome. I'm willing to donate, doctor. -You're welcome. Praise be to Allah. Thank you. One more time? One more time. I have the blood test results in my hand. The one qualifies will have to observe dietary restrictions. Watch your diet, jog every morning,... ...eat foods that are beneficial to the liver. And you have to do health checks every week. Can you do that? So, who qualifies? It's Ahmad Reduan Karim Jalani Fatani. Ahmad Reduan Karim Jalani Fatani? Yes. Why must it be me? I'm a heavy smoker. Why is my liver the most suitable for her? This is fate. Maybe this is the best for all of us. Maybe God wants... ...to reward you handsomely. Karim. I'm begging you. Please. It's for Arisha. Please. All right. I will try. For Arisha's sake. The doctor told me earlier... ...that we will have to watch his diet. Food! What are you waiting for? Eat up! Hurry, Ray! That way! -Let's go! One, two, three! Hey, man, I've waited almost two hours for you. I even thought of leaving. Whether it's one or two hours, it doesn't matter. I'll pay you. Do you think it's for free? Let's move. May God have mercy. -Conjuring! What the heck? Go back inside. Why are you leaving all of us? You don't understand. You're still young. Now go to bed. I don't want you to leave. You don't understand. If I go back inside, I..... I could lose my life. I will tell Daddy Ray that I don't want your liver. What's going on? Fighting with your wife... ...doesn't warrant you leaving your daughter. Are you abandoning your child? What the heck, man? She's not my child. Stay out of my business! Go back inside. I'm sorry, Arisha. Forgive me. It's okay, I understand. No matter what, don't forget me, okay? Take care of yourself. Where is Karim? He's unreliable. He's a coward. Have you seen Daddy Karim? How would I know? I haven't seen Daddy Karim. Same here. He didn't pick up my calls either. The girl is going for surgery tomorrow. What's going on? Seems like we will have to postpone Arisha's surgery. We'll need to find a new donor. I'm feeling quite mad at this old man. Karim is so unreliable. You guys go berserk when I disappear for a while? I only went shopping. I bought you something. Do you want to see it? You went shopping? You should be staying at the ward, not go shopping. Don't do this again. I know. So, do you like your present? I do! Thank you, daddy! I love you. Stay put for once! Why are you looking at me? I just want to thank you for being honest with me. I really appreciate it. It was Arisha who taught us to be nicer. And now we're determined not to be bad again. Besides,... Besides,... ...Arisha is going to undergo an operation tomorrow. It's operation. Operation sounds like a police activity. That's what I meant. Zack? -Zahirah. From now on, call me Zahirah. Wow, nice. Watch it. Thank you, Arisha. You taught us what it means to love. Love has been missing from our hearts for so long. This liver... ...will be my gift to you. This way,... ...I will always be with you. Excuse me, sir. The visiting hour is over. You can go back to your room. You have to sleep early. You're going to have a surgery tomorrow. You have to sleep early too. You're going to have a surgery too. Sir, please sit down. I don't need the wheelchair. I can walk. No, sir. This is doctor's order. You can't move too much. It will destabilise... ...your blood pressure. Please sit down. All right. Where are we going? Stop! -Be quiet and get in. Get in! I'm scared. I'm scared. If Arisha..... If Arisha..... You shouldn't talk like that. We have to pray hard... We have to pray hard... ...and think positive. God willing, Arisha is a strong girl. Ray! -What? We're in trouble. -What's going on? Someone told us that Karim has been kidnapped by Pablo's men. What? Where are you going? -I have something to do. The saviour of the world has arrived! Where's my money? Serves you right. Hey, I'm your big fan. I gave you a chance to work with me but you turned me down. If you want to take this gambling addict with you,... ...you have to beat me first. Can you do that? Yes! We got the first point! Hey, Karim! Sit down! That's my seat! Get him, Ray! Yes, like that! Ouch! That hurts, mom. Untie me, Ray. Then what about you? -Don't mind me. Go! Karim! Aki. Go and check on Ray. He's at Pablo's place. Now? -Yes. Now! Alif, let's go. Hurry! Has the surgery started? -This guy. Arisha. -Yes? It's already late. I will take you to visit your mom and dad again soon. Okay, daddy. Let's go home, Ray. You guys go ahead. What if something happens? Come on. It's me, Ray. I'm sorry, brother,... ...sister. Your children are very naughty. Just like me. Now I know... ...how you took care of me before. I promise... I promise... ...that I will take good care of your kids. I'll raise them to be decent human beings. I promise you. I promise. Dad,... ...when I grow up,... ...I want to become a doctor. Thank you dad, for taking care of me.
