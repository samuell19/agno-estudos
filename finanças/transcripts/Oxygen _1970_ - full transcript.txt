Passport. Passports, please. To the Island, to Congress. Journalist, journalist. Ordinary things. Cameras, take a look. My wife. Wonderful, unique. And important, important. It doesn't work without me, you'll see. Funny! That sway calmed me down. You're salty, ma'am. Where to? To the Island? Me too. An interesting social formation. A lot can happen these days. So they say... It hangs in the air. These are rich moments. People are rising and falling. The world is derailed. Maybe it's on a new path. Excitement encourages creation. And sometimes confusion. Everyone is waiting for what happens in Congress. You just left me. What's with you? Do you think... Do you think there are any dangerous animals on the Island? Shells. - The kind with pearls? Are you sure we're on the right ship? It will be better if we don't know each other. Japanese painters changed their names to preserve their freedom. ISLAND Travel with us to a new day on Fairytale Island. Now everyone is traveling. My finger too. What about our story? - Our story is looking good. I'm going to come to you now. Sir, how dare you? Oh, no! I wonder if I find anything new. Nothing. - I don't believe it, I don't believe it. Leave me alone! Can't you see they're watching us? The Island show wishes you good morning. Where are we? Don't you really know? On Fairy Island though! Where? I do not know yet. I warn you, ma'am, that the island has an interesting history. - What is it? Look what a famous stone. A few years ago, you know... - Back when you didn't know me yet? ...they dug up some precious statue here. And then they found a small, lonely island. They listened to the birds singing. Yellow, green, blue, yellow-green... Marko! What? - I thought that someone came to look for you. But I just closed my eyes and he was gone. He'll be back. He won't dare if I'm around. One... - One, two, three... - First day on the Island. He just skipped the first night. Look at those two guys from the beach. Look at how they're dressed. They are behaving really strangely. Maybe it's some secret command. I love secrets so much. They're looking here. Maybe... Strange! I locked them up! What is it? Do you see somebody again? I see you, you! You're handsome. You and your fairy tales. When does the Congress begin? - In the evening. One moment, please. Please... Television diary. A special show about Congress. Follow. Quick, action! Do you have a spare wheel? - What wheel? What about fire? It will rain. My wife says you're after us. - Us? This is a good car, right? So what should I answer my wife? It's really going to rain. If you sent her flowers, it would be easier to get to know each other. Flowers are more suitable for the end than for the beginning. Do any of you have a gun? - Of course! I mean the kind for lighting cigarettes. Light one for the gentleman. It's not a lighter. Sister? So, are you going to send a card and flowers? - All right, we will. Okay, at least we know each other now. The Student Committee of the Island invites you to its club. This is our national specialty. You do not find such flowers in every garden. The camera is running. Follow them. I lost them! Here they are, here they are. 40 meters. - Stop. Does he accompany them? - Yes. Quick! Action! Where are we? Well, now we're lost. You know what? They will erect a monument to you. Why? How? When you leave me. Where are you going? You get smarter, you surprise me. What if you die prematurely? Why are you scaring me? You talk too much. If you told anything to the students, we're both in trouble. They are not dangerous. - Fool, you know what they can accuse us of! Salve! Good day. - Good evening. Are you already members? No. - No, we're new. Then go there first. Here? - Yes, please. So... Yes, one by one, please. - What an order... Don't hug me. FREEDOM A revolution is not a feast! A revolution is not a walk! A revolution is a permanent revolution! A revolution is identity! An identity is a rebellion against power! A revolution is the struggle of life with death! A revolution is not the government! The government is murder! The government is suicide! A revolution is the present! A revolution is excitement! It's a dance! It's a scream! Should we go up as well? A revolution has no goals! Rebellion helps the authorities! A revolution consolidates power! A revolution is murder! A revolution is suicide! A revolution is the struggle of life with death! A revolution wants power! It wants a goal! The revolution is eating its children! The revolution is a feast! How did you get here? They all believe what they say. They have some good ideas. Art is supposed to help science. It is supposed to fight for order and clarity. I don’t tolerate pointless bouncing. Many foreign guests and journalists look forward to the Congress on the Island. The hotels are full of foreign guests. Our reporters will inform you about the preparations for the Congress, on which the further development path of the Island will be decided. Look, look who came! - Ooooo! Pretty woman! - Who are you, woman? Gentlemen, look at the man who sailed from afar. This is a man with a thousand faces and a hand that writes fateful words. We don't know him! Who are you, huh? - Are you the Christ? Journalist! What a resemblance! God Himself sent you! Journalist. If you’re a journalist, you can only benefit our thing. Control 5. Control 5. Execute the command immediately. Over. She noticed us! You're cheeky, honey. I convey... I convey to you the greetings and feelings of our Central Committee, parliament, government, trade unions,... I especially embrace the humanities deputies and other progressive movements from many lands. We are in great danger. Revolution threatens. We don't want a revolution! We don't need it! By no means should we forget progress. Individual freedom is an anarchist fabrication. We must fight for freedom at a higher level! Gentlemen, cut the ribbon. Come closer. The show will start at any moment. We offer you this show, mind you, in exchange for the freedom you have kindly ceded to the state. In these times there is a great demand for freedom. Freedom is our first export item. To the monastery, Ophelia. monastery Listen, you! - Enough, what are you so serious about? It's all theater. - What's wrong with you? They robbed us, like everyone else. - Why are you disturbing the rehearsal? We just criticize, but we don’t change anything. We affirm a virtual democracy! Yes, there is a catch here, we have a democracy! In Congress, now, everything has to change! We were preparing this, you understand? Yes, if it's the homeland, then we should undress as well! What square words. All vertical and horizontal sentences. They build with them. - It's getting complicated. Congress is an expectation, but of course everyone expects something of their own. You forget we're on the Fairytale Island. - Ah, I don't know. Maybe they're right. Maybe something really needs to change. What then? Revolution? Will there be more freedom? They will ignore foreign freedom and embrace their own? Students expect you to write something about them. Ah, a strange revolution. As if it's not real. It's not dangerous. - Too bad. But I like danger. Look! I'll tell you a goodnight fairy tale. Odysseus was more and more unhappy, because he spent his whole life on the run. So many images his eyes recorded wandering around the world accumulated in his head that they came to life when he closed his eyes. His head began to spin and he had to open his eyes again at once. He became more and more tired from the constant wakefulness. But he was afraid of sleep, because in his sleep a film would begin to play with great haste, known to his eyes. He was getting more and more sleepy and exhausted, when he heard that he can get rid of his nightmares, if he transfers them to paper. He sat down next to a large book and began to transcribe his adventures into it. The more he had written, the better he felt and sometimes he could even fall asleep. The images faded more and more and only when he wrote thousands of pages they moved to paper forever. Odysseus could die at last. I'm cold. Your fairy tales are too sad. Don't tell me. I am tired. I'm going to sleep now. I'm going somewhere far away. I'm going already. Just go. I'm coming after you. I dream fast. Be careful not to be too late. PATRICIA dreams... Congress empty, fairy tale??????? Please. Why do you think I'm crazy? Why are you blabbering on about duties, about emotions? Why should they be so attached to their land that it is a peasant habit? Borders are becoming irrelevant, political systems ridiculous. What remains is what develops, what has a future. Science! That's why I'm here. That's why we're talking. Give me resources and people. The results are important. A real revolution is a matter of science. Give me computers, I don’t mean to deal with paper and pencil. Biochemistry is no joke. Of course, it's dangerous. But also attractive. Why miss such an opportunity? So I came right? Of course, fine by me. In a few days, then. One word. Take it or leave it. Why such embarrassment? How nicely dressed you are. Is that you? I don't understand the question. - Can it be? What? - To be visited by a woman like you. We're on the Island. You are very famous. I can also be very helpful. - Everyone knows that. For now, we are alone. You don't like that? - Nicer and nicer. They say you only know about numbers. They say there will soon be more opportunities for people like me on the Island. If you touch me, it’s like touching a chair or a table. I don’t like the way you respond. I don't like it either. Neither this room nor your face. Then you came to the wrong address. Maybe not. Time is running out. We're getting older. Why did you come? You know why. Don't you know? LOVE You are taking too long steps. - And you too short. Do you see something red there? Now you see a red spot, before you saw a white horse. There where the wind blows. Watch out! Why? It ran away. It could sting me. Some kind of red house. Some kind of crumbling red house. It's probably a monastery. Let's go inside. It is hollow, like all houses. Let's go back. I'm interested. Why don't you want to look? I'm afraid! Goodbye, we're going now. But you can stay. For a monk, if you will. You're taking too long steps again! Everyone is doing something. Even sand, wind work. And we walk and count the monuments. Why are you looking at me like that? Am I talking nonsense? Would you... - What? ...make love, here? - Right now? Of course. What do you mean? - So... You know what? I would love to see things as they are. This is what women say when they close their eyes. I must not close them. I need to see what's going on. Sometimes I get scared, you know? When I observe how this so-called glorious history is formed. However, it may not continue to form. You think we lose something when we're happy? Comrades, change is no longer necessary. We became part of the Mainland. We are no longer forgotten and remote. We got involved in the real world. We became strong. But power is built on unity... New government! - Revolution! We want independence! - Our existence is in danger! Revolution! - Revolution! We will remain strangers in a maze of abundance. We will be like ants in this soulless wheel. Our politics is disguised as violence! Let the island remain the Island! Let's leave the golden calf to others! Listen! They are right! The island cannot become part of the Mainland. I'm telling you. The most important thing is our common cause. But there is discord between us. Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! We don't want what's theirs, we don't give up what's ours! If the government falls, everything will change. Not for us. They will always need us. This is no longer bearable! - That our friendship with the Mainland it is to our economic detriment! We... ...we are a colony for them! We are being chased everywhere by intruders. On every step! Let's reject the Mainland's insidious offers! We want to live under the free sun. - Island! Island! Island! These are strangers themselves! They hate us! Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! Island! We want... Long live the revolution! - Under the free sun! Do you know what I'm thinking? What? That I'm actually the only one. What do you mean the only one? - The only one. The only one in the whole world. There are others. - Where! Have you ever seen such a stupid face? You're crazy! - The only one. Drink! - Do you understand? Unique! That's damn important! I only have one life. Why do I keep forgetting about it? You're quite funny. But where should I go? I just stick my finger in the sea, but I am in touch with the whole world. Listen! Our ancestors they mapped the Island to a map of the world with their lives. They defended and built it. They were dying on it. They wrote songs about it. And all we do is wait. We resist because we are ashamed. Big words stuck in our throats. Help us. - From now on, actions will speak. What, dead? - You see she's playing. She noticed we were chasing her. Hello? Please rewind. Let's look again. I remembered something. What reports does it send? - Too critical. We must prevent any unforeseen daring performance. Now is not the time to play. Let them watch over them. - We constantly monitor all foreign journalists. Show me other clips. Let's continue the screening! The fate of the Island is similar to the fate of individuals in today’s world. It’s a high tide without the low tide. High tide of techniques and trade, which floods the Island! A revolution is needed! Everything needs to change! Freedom to the individual! Concentration of power is suicide! Let's turn down the Mainland's offers! When we fight for the Island, we fight for a better future for our children! Society needs a conscious individual! It needs perspective! Listen! Something important is happening. Now is the chance that something really changes! This is a thing that is new to the whole world! Everyone will admire your country. Write it down! Write down those words! What is happening will serve as an example to others! We are turning history around! You had another number yesterday. - No, not us. - Which one? We've seen each other before. - Maybe. We perform often. But always with the same number. Are they sharp? - Yes. Zoom. Camera. Good. 30 m. 40 m. Citizens of the Island, after a tumultuous session, Congress elected a new leadership today, which took immediate action and rejected the Mainland's offer regarding a closer connection with the Island. Other reasons for this decision will be explained in the coming days. They succeeded. I can hardly believe it. There is joy on the Island. The young inhabitants of the Island are also celebrating the victory. You will see. Everything will be fine. How carefree you are. What if I have a baby? What kind do you want? Miraculous? With blue eyes? Ah, you men don't want responsibility. Just think of pleasure. No, I was serious about the baby. That would make him eternal. I would have something of my own. Then I would have less doubt. I would feel something that is becoming more and more real. Something that needs me. I'm so useless. So meaningless. What words. Until eternity. How do you feel? - As I should. I hear you have a great influence among the revolutionaries here on the Island. I'm coming with a suggestion... - Oh, that's fast. Excuse me. I'm waiting for a phone call. Besides, I wouldn’t want to get involved in the affairs of the Island. Journalists, however, are well informed. I do not understand. Suddenly I'm confused. Are you not afraid to... Sorry, I didn't come at the right time. I'll find you tomorrow. Good night. Hey, good morning! Hello? Hello? Patricia, my wife... Something strange happened. Pardon? Sorry, I'm upset. My wife is not here. What? Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding? I found a pillow in the bed! I'm not crazy, you hear! How do I know? Excuse me, Mr. professor. Are you alone? - Listen, please. Could I... Could I ask you... Excuse me please. I've been... I've been waiting for three hours. What did the police tell you? I already told you. You wait in vain. But, a woman cannot just disappear. It must be a mistake. Maybe it's a joke. How should we know about all the quarrels? I do not understand! Do you think I'm crazy? - Why? - How dare you? What did you tell me? Should I keep repeating your nonsense? No no. Excuse me. You didn't understand me. You didn’t understand me and you don’t understand anything at all. Nice day for flights. Our new president is a simple and humble man. Wherever he goes, people greet him with enthusiasm. Today he bathed in the city baths. Who's calling? Hello? Hello! Telegram. "Urgently report to the Foreign Ministry. Stop. We will help you. Stop." Are you alone? Where are the others? - They're tired. Some even got hired. They don't want to come. They say we blew it. Tell your Indian chief we won't wait. After all, the revolution lasted until he became a minister himself. If there isn’t any show soon, I’ll forget the lines. It seems to me that we are already forgetting what we used to say. A man can believe it or not, it’s his thing. A man is free. He pays for everything himself. For faith, unbelief, for love, for wit. A man pays for everything himself. And so he is free. What is a man? Is this not you? Not me, not them? No! That's huge! Therein lies all the beginnings and all the ends. It's all in the man. It's all for the man. A man, that's greatness. That sounds proud. What are we going to do? Are we going to invent a new revolution? Or are we going to chase some new woman? How do you like the Island? In a year or two you will see... What a drama, look. This authenticity, how real. Excellency, this is about my wife. You see, it's going to be hard. We don't know anything about with her. If she's still alive at all. She was probably kidnapped by our opponents. We do not yet know exactly what they oppose. They were defeated in Congress. Maybe we can talk to them. It will be hard, wait a little longer. Everything will be different. The Mainland comes to the Island's aid. We need to protect the friendship that binds us. Nothing will change. - But what does that matter to me? I do not understand. You are an educated man. We don’t live in a time of fairy tales. Island, Robinson Crusoe,... This is not possible. - But my wife... The youth is resisting outside. Barricades. Like a hundred years ago. Funny. What a noise. I have to keep you here for now. For safety. But I am a journalist! Neutral. There are international laws about this! M... What strange people. What about my wife? The Mainland has helped the Island and will help you. The world is so small today and there are no real borders. Why didn't you answer? We thought you weren't home. We are together again. Don't you bathe? I should probably explain. - Keep going. Proceed as if everything is clear. Why don't you like the Island? Why don't you sit? Before you entered, you took a walk. And you, what were you doing before you entered? I was afraid. - Of me? Your people... - My people are gone. I wouldn't say. Is that from your wife? My 20th day on the Island. They take great care of me. Now they sent me a woman. You should shave if you want to come with me. Have you already guessed why I came? Didn't we agree not to explain anything? Do you want me to wear one? No. No... Get your business done. That's why you came. We could talk. We have a whole bunch of words to choose from. Which ones do you know? I know a lot of them. Emotions, religion, language, culture, romance, holiness, science, things, important things, big things, thoughts, actions,... If you wanted to kiss me, I would not resist. - ...politics, literature, economy, ecstasy, pragmatism. What's up, huh? Eclecticism, nihilism, capitalism, people. Oh of course, people. People, people, super-people. Crowds, faces, new truths, people. Ordinary people. I can go too. No, I should... It does not matter. My enemy is elsewhere. I carry it within me. You know how to forget very well. It should hurt you, drag you through thorns or something. Should I also forget what has just happened between us? Did anything happen at all? Our country. It is full of monuments. At every step, they force you to remember something. I was told that some kind of king was sleeping in it. I was still quite small. Then I thought, that it must be tight inside. It's crazy. He can't hear the knocking. I love that skin. It's soft. It doesn't hurt to knock. And he says "Is anyone home?" There is no one. - I hear him. In here. It's locked in here. There is no air. Let's go. Why don't you stay with us? We could live together. I get caught up in words I didn’t want to say. I follow myself along strange paths. You're dreaming? When I’m awake, I feel like I’m dreaming. You never say yes or no. Trust whoever you want. I have said this once before. - To someone else. It doesn't work without me. You will see. Look at him. What is it, darling? Are there any others already? Isn't it a pity for such a good place? It's owned by the state. Where are your friends? Will you come, you know how to play? - It matters who wins. You already lost, now you have to get out. - Out! Or inside. It depends from which side you are looking from. This is nonsense. That doesn't make sense. It is necessary to sacrifice, to persevere in the face of death. Science, this is the real revolution. There are some smart people among the students. They need to be included. Used! How many hours? And how many minutes? Years? It all went to waste. Borders need to be erased. Then we will move into the world of fantasy. Stop it! I didn’t want us to miss. I got used to the color of your voice and gestures. This gives the wait something real. They take care of me. Now they sent me a woman. You should shave if you want to come with me. Day 25. The sea. I'm listening to the sea... Don't talk. Listen. You can't see me. I'm not here. You don't think that's true. To speak to someone else who would like to disguise himself. I am a forgotten thing. Hidden in the dark. I never thought about what I was doing. You remember me. And it becomes even more clear to me that I am immobile. Dead. I couldn't stand your gaze. Full of anticipation and tenderness. You are capable of fear and despair. And I used to, I do not know when, said yes. And then I repeated it. As a chorus. We are hidden here. When we're out, we'll be enemies again. We can only make love in the dark. Maybe we could achieve peace. We would touch with fleeting glances and with tenderness. But I'm afraid of someone else's hand. Let's savor the moment when we know nothing. I sensed that, heard. Look! A statue of Kairos. God of the right moment, waiting for the good wind. Look at me! To catch the right moment, he should have wings. Good moment. You have to catch me so I won't think back. You are taking too long steps. I feel like I've known you for years. What does that mean? I'm for us to stay here. - Let's to America. That's bullshit. - That's cowardly! Wait! What are we going to do here? They will imprison us! Stick your neck out. We will convene Congress. This is our Congress, do you hear? - Don't disturb the scene. We'll go to a lonely Island where there are no people. We will establish a state, we will arrange everything anew. Look who's coming! - Who? - Strangers! - Let's get on with the show! Continue! - Let the whole world hear us. - Bring them! Will anyone write anything about us at least now This one will write about us. - He doesn't understand anything. Come with us! Look! This is a man with a thousand looks and a hand that writes fateful words. Maybe you are the Savior. - We'll christen you! Come with us! - Watch the camera! Hey, we're recording everything for our chronicle. We will send it around the world. Thousands will see us. Our doing is a half-revolution because we work together with the world as it is! What you see is a narrative that has nothing to do with reality. We are timid and obedient. So we turn everything to a brighter side. We have to take risks. We need to tell the truth. This movie shows how repressive societies promote a constructive revolution and how us artists work with the working class! We need to become bolder! We are the avant-garde. The whole world is watching us. I can't listen to this anymore. We need to start with a new civilization without a mask. I don't care about your revolution. Your freedom is just like theirs. Damn rags! Why don't we show them our asses? Let's go to the water! Stop it! Stop! We will not quarrel in front of the whole world! This, this is no message! We are not children! Stop it! This is a damn important thing. We have to agree. We are not alone here. They expect us to do something smart. This is no damn toy like before. The thing fell apart. We have nothing more to look for on the Island. They will catch us like mice. Now is the right time to go. I'm in favor of going to Insula. There is no living soul there. We will establish a new republic. We will arrange everything anew! I am for us to stay together. - Yes! You don't think they know about our every move? We would have to go to the barricades, but there are too few of us. Like mice, like mice they'll catch us. - You know what, you... Listen! I'm in favor of going... to go to the Mainland. They don't know us. We can do many things without being noticed. We connect with their people. To the Mainland! To the Mainland! Let's help them! Let's inoculate them with the germ of freedom! - You know what? Let’s got to the center of the reaction. If we just watch, it’s over. We are no partisans. We have to agree. If they don’t have opposition, they will do even worse things. We have to work at home. Everything we achieve is good! The beginning, as in a fairy tale. You come like a sea fairy. Beginning, as in the alphabet. I come as the letter A. A... A... A... Let's play with words. B, B,... - B, B, B,... I'm afraid. - What? Of the letter D. What to do with it? - Skip it! I can not. I will fall into the sea. Is there anything new in the sea? - All the same. Did you meet the flood man? No. Strange, I thought they had their people in the sea too. You forgot about the game. Penalty. Penalty! You bothered me. You come like a sea fairy. - I'm not a fairy. Let's do something else. - No, no, I'm still at the letter L. I love you! You're cheating, you're cheating! Those are three words. Come here, letter A. I don't like this game. - Can't finish it? Won't you forget me? - If I forgot you, I would lose you. You are like others. You just make letters. R... fish, rhubarb, revolution. S... with you, happy, alone. T, T... you, moment, now, here. You are... - Faithful, happy, loving, everything you want. I want to... You are... So much time... Tell... Happy people live here and those who visit us share the joy. The past... The future is before us... together... holidays and days they will be full of scattered happiness and bright laughter and self-confidence of power. The secret of the Island, the secret of this world and its monuments, unforgettable voices of the past, a form of our courtesy. This welcome, our invitation. Allow... In their study, geographers... sought... ...centuries... ...they made a terrible mistake anyway . Our Island is not a real island. It's a peninsula. Reasons for the mistake... The causes can be different, but the fact is... The island became part of the mainland. English subtitles by: bjelakrez
