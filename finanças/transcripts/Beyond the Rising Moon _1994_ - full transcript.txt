Since the initial discovery of the alien spacecraft and 2054 by the Equatron corporation we have located no other relics of the Tesseran culture. Why did they abandon their vessel? What do they look like? Where did they come from and where did they go? All we have is a tantalizing piece of machinery and damn few answers. As you know the scientific developments from this find have pushed human technology literally light years ahead of itself. A prime example being faster than light travel. However two and a half weeks ago a Norwegian Interworld research ship under the command of Ian Borge was conducting surveys of an unexplored planet he'd christened he Elysium. By the purest coincidence one of Borges survey probes landed within visual range of what he believed to be a Tesseran artifact. Unfortunately Borg never had the chance to verify the find. His vessel lost its fuel and a micro meteor collision. But before his orbit decayed, Borge transmitted the data to the Norwegian Interworld base on Sigma 5. At this point the find is still unverified. His untimely death has opened a loophole in interstellar Salvage law which we may now exploit. Because Borge never actually set foot on Elysium Norwegian Interworld cannot claim the find if it exists. Sir, I propose that we get Kuriyama Enterprises down on the surface of Elysium before Norwegian Interworld or any other competitor and claim this find. Whatever it might be under interstellar Salvage law all rights would be ours. That would be substantial coup for us Yes. It is due to arrive this evening at Star City. I've arranged to have their couriers intercepted by one of ours. Pentan? Yes, she was made for this type of work. If that tape does contain information about another Tesseran ship it'll do big things for this corporation. The Norwegian couriers we'll be landing in 45 minutes. Engage and cancel them. Sorry, I know that makes you feel uncomfortable. Why shouldn't it? You activate that a little charge goes off in my head an 70 hours later I'm dead from a massive hemorrhage. After the kill find a safe place and absorb the data with this. Rendezvous with me at Jun Hon station by 3:20 and everything will be fine. Why must they be killed? We want no loose ends. No evidence. Which is why you're going to memorize the tape with that. What about my freedom? Come on now. Let's not start that again. You know we can't do that. You're not recognized by the law. They don't even know you exist. Besides if you didn't work for us what would you do? Live a normal life. Let's keep in mind what you are. Hmm? Keep a clear head. They're on a real hurry to get us back here. Yeah, I hate it when you don't know what you're carrying. Well that's when you really know it's important. Yeah but, at least they could do is let you know if it's animal vegetable or mineral. Don't move. Pentan VO - Why must they be killed? Moesby VO - We want no loose ends. Moesby VO - You're compelled to carry out your instructions. Pentan VO - What about my freedom? Moesby VO - You're not recognized by the law. Pentan VO - Kill only when necessary , remember? Moesby VO - Whoever possesses that data is going to be very rich. Pentan! Where do you think you're going? Open the door. I'll kill you don't you that? Pentan! Don't push me. I'll do it. I'll do it! Shit. If I had the money I to give it to you. Since Danny ran off I haven't been able to pay anyone. Look just give me a couple more days. Look Brickman, I don't care if the partner stuck you with the debt. He's gone. But it's you who owe me now. It's already been two weeks. Tomorrow I'm gonna file an injunction against your ship. And just to be sure that you don't run out on me why the legalities in progress, I'm gonna have to Tebrook a pull your Tesseran fuel cell. Like hell you will. Now that's a bad attitude, Herald. Tebrook, if you please. If this Neanderthal tries to board my ship, I'm going to smash his its damn skull in ... That'll be enough. It seems that you have a rescuer, Brickman. Back off. I think you've picked the wrong time ... Grunts. I'll be back tomorrow with the legal authority to to back me up. Yeah, well I'll be here George. Son of a bitch. I'd like to thank you for helping me, miss? Pentan. Miss Pentan. Pentan is enough you Well you must like excitement in your life Brickman. Occasionally. Do you need a doctor? No. I've been a lot worse off then this before. I bet you have. Look thanks again for helping me. If there's anything I can do for you sometime. As a matter of fact there is. If you're up to it. I would like to charter your ship. You do charter don't you? Sure do. From what I've gathered you could use the money. Yeah well who couldn't? So what's the haul? Just me. I want you to fly me to Innisfree. It's a planet within the Halcyon system. I know where it is. That's quite a distance. You'd have to be talking about a lot of money. Possibly. Would you like one? Sure thanks. That's the destination. I require two things from this voyage - speed and anonymity. I can pay you 8,000 American dollars. Here's six thousand cash in advance. You'll get the rest at the end of our voyage. But this is all on the condition that we leave as soon as possible. We could leave by mid-morning. Is that the soonest? I get some supplies take care of some business. And pay some debts? Yeah. You were created from genes carefully selected from thousands of people. Geniuses, artists, athletes, all contributed to your intelligence and your superior physical prowess. But I know how people fear me. I know I'm not human. You're a marvel. One of great value. Particularly to this corporation. I will educate you. Teach you to use that gift in your head. You were designed to cancel obstructions to this corporation and use all your faculties to achieve your objectives. You are made unfettered by the human emotions of sympathy or love. They're weaknesses. Your reasoning power logic and superior physical ability are your strengths. Carry out your instructions with ruthless precision. Kill only when you have to. But when you do, use any means available. All right, let's see what you remember from yesterday. Begin. Stop! Look one instant of lax behavior like that in the field and you're dead. Try it again. Begin. Well! Good. Very good. And this is your Auto programming course selector. And of course all of these weapon systems are controlled through the joystick here. What you're about to meet is of being designed for physical strength and intellect. She can be used to steal, seduce, kill or perform any number of a myriad of functions with precision all to further the objectives of Kuriyama Enterprises. The most subtle and perhaps the most effective tool of corporate warfare. I introduced Pentan. Shit. Hey hey hey hey. Hold it! Don't move. Well just tell George I got his money right here alright? Shut up. You'll have to come with us now. No Moesby, I won't. Why? You're working for someone else? You keep forgetting that you're not a human being with the rights recognized by the law. We designed you. We created you. You belong to us. We want what you acquired last night. Where is it? Up here. So I wouldn't let any of your goon boys open fire on me. Get her. Unprofessional Moesby. You're getting sloppy. You of all people should know how that costs. Remember what you told me in training? Always know your objective and pursue it with ruthless precision. And what is your objective? To get there before us? Claim the ship? Buy yourself an identity? That's pretty damn naive coming from you. You were a best design. What a pity you'll be dead in 65 hours now by my count. I know. You've activated the stroker. So what are you going to do? I could start by busting you up. (Engine roaring) Frightened? We have to leave before he returns with reinforcements. You don't want to take me now do you? Look what he said is true. If I'm not Innisfree and 65 hours I'll be dead. There's a man there who can help but I need you to get me there. You just killed those two men. It was necessary. I don't know what the hell's going on here or what you are. But I don't need to get involved. I got enough problems of my own. It's too late Brickman, you're already involved. I'm sorry I gotta report this. No, I'm sorry. Oh great. Jesus. Aerial pursuit, I have a male target insight. Home in on my beacon. Don't kill the bastard, I need him alive and keep a sharp eye out for her. Freeze right where you are. [crunch] [gunfire] [explosion] Increase altitude now! [gunfire] [explosion] [explosion] [engine sound] Moesby, have the Promethean fueled and ready to leave orbit at once. Right, sir. Well we're on course we got to be there in about 53 hours. So isn't there something you want to tell me? No. No? Okay. Well are you hungry then? No. So you're a synthetic person? That's what that was all about back there wasn't it? Yes. I always thought synthetic people were ... Less than human? Yeah. I mean no. I mean I thought they were designed to do menial duties or jobs considered too dangerous for ... Real people? All right. So who were those guys back there anyway? Former employers. I was designed for corporate warfare. Theft, seduction, assassination. But I got tired of being slave to them doing their dirty work so I left. While doing so ... I kept something they had me steal for them. Do you remember when the Tesseran ship was discovered? Of course I was in high school. As you can see it made quite an impression on me. Well you can imagine what it did for industry. The amount of revenue it generated for its discoverers. That ship was the most valuable find in history. Its unique. Another one has never been discovered. The propulsion systems on this ship are an example of just one of its technological applications. I know where there's another one. It's unclaimed. But if I'm not on Innisfree by tomorrow it won't matter. Why not? There's a device implanted in the back of my head which will cause a massive cerebral hemorrhage in less than 65 hours. There's a man on Innisfree who may be able to help me. Well I'll get you there. You can trust me. I've been taught never to trust anyone. But I have no choice. Fine. So where do we go when we get to Innisfree. To Sky House. It's a center of a huge terraforming operation. I have a friend there. Robert Thornton. He's a genetic engineer. He designed me. He's the only one who can help. He may be able to stop it. Why don't you try to get some sleep? No. I'd rather not. Why not? I'm afraid I might not wake up. You know you're very important to us. To me in particular. I would like you to have this. Let it be a symbol of our ideals of fealty, strength and logic. How do you feel? Considering that I'm looking at you I feel fine. Can you sit up? I think so. Good to see you girl. You look wonderful. God I stink. I've been sweating in these clothes for four days now. Yeah you're a bit ripe. Thanks. What happened? Another Tesseran ship has been found and I'm the only one who knows where it is. You've broken away? Did you think I wouldn't want my freedom? Did you think I was stupid? You, Pentan, never. You've always been one of the most consistently clear thinkers I've ever designed. when it comes to strategy. Hello. Well Brickman, this is Innisfree. It is a bit barren, actually hardly habitable. But when you consider how hostile a planet's environment can be it's really quite tame. The vapors below are deadly after prolonged exposure. That's why all the structures here are built above a certain altitude. Brickman? Thank you. You're welcome. Are you sure you have everything you need? Yes. With your computer I was able to analyze the data. I now know the precise location of the artifact and have a good idea of what to expect from the environment. Okay. You know Kuriyama's right behind us. I've held my own against him before. Ah ... well ... a Hmm. [sniffs] Umm ... smells like adventure in the air. Engine exhaust maybe? No, no no that's a ... [sniffs] that's definitely adventure. Come on. Let's blow this joint. I'd like to thank you for everything, sir. Take care of yourself Brickman. I intend to. She cares for people more than she'll admit. Here we go. Okay, Tulwar number two. Switch her on. Let's get ready to go. We're gonna be proceeding straight on to Sky House. Tulwar 2, I've got a contact at 240.8. Canceled flight plan Skyhouse and pursue. Affirmative Tulwar 1, I copy. I got two contacts on an intercept course closing rapidly. Oh shit. Tulwars. We sure as hell won't be able outrun them. Hailing class D628892 do you copy, over? Hailing class D628892 do you copy, over? Affirmative, we copy. Please identify yourself you're not transmitting your registration signal. Mr. Brickman, you will rendezvous with our mother ship orbital reference zero niner four niner two six or we will eradicate your vessel. Respond. Nice guys. He's brought out the Promethean. Do what they say. Do what they say? Affirmative, we'll comply. I ain't going in no mother ship. Look how casually they're flying next to us. What do you think this is just some cabin cruiser? We'll wait until we're out of the atmosphere then I'll blast their navigational thrusters. With the plasma projector? You know about that? It was one of the deciding factors when I first met you. Brickman it can't be legal otherwise it would have been registered in your listing. Yeah, I've been meaning to do that. Uh-huh. So you know how it works? Yes. Well I gotta get us out of the atmosphere anyway so why don't you try to hit the navigational thrusters. But just the thrusters, okay? That ought to knock them out of commission. At least I have a chance to be picked up before their orbits decay. And that'll buy us enough time to get the hell out of here. Okay D628892, stand by to release control and allow slave docking transmissions on channel three two - one - two, over. Jesus he's not fooling around. The Promethean. Kuriyama is sparing no expense to catch up with us. This is his biggest business endeavor to date and he doesn't want me to screw it up for him. Well if we're gonna break away now's the time. I'll fly. You operate the fire control. But on my signal. Hold on! Mayday, this is Tulwar 2, I'm hit bad. My reactor starting to heat up. I'm gonna have to punch out I'm gonna have to eject. This is Promethean Tulwar 2 - we're just patching a rescue craft over. No no I can't wait too long. I gotta go now. I'm ejecting. So why won't you kiss me? Because I don't feel what you feel. My past experiences with sex I've never involved feeling emotion. Not in the sense that you want it. I'm not talking about sex. I know that's why I can't give you what you want. How do you know? I mean how can you be so sure you've never tried before? I don't know how. I ... ...can act it but I can't feel it. And I don't want to deceive you. Well I want you to do is to trust me. Hello Takashi. Hello Robert. John. You're, looking well mate. She got away Robert. I need to know what you know. Elysium, that's where she's going. And I have no idea what system it's in. You know her almost as well as I do. She iddn't tell me anything more than she had to. Moesby seize the memory systems the computer systems here and run a high-speed scan for any data pertaining to a Elysium. Right, sir. Commander Moesby, we've secured the data room and preparing our scans. You know you're taking a dangerous gamble? That's right. The biggest one to date. What's gone wrong with her, Robert? You tell me. You're the one who had her trained as an assassin. That wasn't my idea. Or have you forgotten that's the reason I left? I'll get her back if possible. Moesby miss evaluated her. She's been in the field just too long. I've got it. It's 24 light-years from here. In the realm. You're right about one thing. I don't need your weaknesses. That's why you're here designing bacteria trying to make this planet habitable. Instead of creating elite beings like Pentan. I'd take you with me if I thought it would do me any good. But as you said I no longer need a conscience. Yukō There's no place in the colonies where you'll be safe if I fail. What are you thinking? You know it wouldn't kill you to open up to me? I've been taught never to trust anyone. In my profession, trust gets you killed. That's why I was the best. I didn't make mistakes. Do you trust me? Look at my hand. Look at it! I've killed with this. That's what I am. That's what I've been trained for. I don't know what it's like to trust someone. Then what did we just share? I gave you what I thought you wanted. Look I'm trying hard not to fool you as to who I am and what I'm capable of. If you wanted something more platonic I'm sorry. Fine. But what happens to me after you get what you want? Will you bother to say something or will you just disappear? Or better yet, we kill me too? This is a very reason why I went into space. It's like a dream come true. No wonder Ian Borge risked his life for this. No radiation is being admitted whatsoever. And only visible light bounces back. Aside from that narrow spectrum it's completely invisible. Wait a minute. Borge's landing probe. Still transmitting data to a man who will never collect it. Now what? We radio our claim to the UN Transportation Authority and wait for them to dispatch a cruiser to substantiate it. Objective sighted. Hold it, you. You're not going anywhere. Prisoners secured. Force ready for landing. Hello boss. What a magnificent find. I congratulate you on your attempt to claim the Tesseran vessel before me. I'm afraid I already have. Pentan, my dear you're an excellent liar. We've been monitoring U.N. transmissions for the past two days. No claims have been filed. And, as you know, if they were, quite a stir or would have been created. We trained and treated you well. You have been of great value to us. What happened? You must analyze your situation now. You cannot succeed. You're overwhelmed. Oh, yeah. Well we got here first so why don't you just take ... Pentan, you've never been taught to accept defeat. Up until now you've been good enough didn't have to. With this find the assets of my corporation will be staggering. Rejoin me. Your emotions have clouded your intellect. I'm giving you a chance to survive. Otherwise I'll have to obliterate you and write you off as a capital loss. Your analysis is as impeccable as always, sir. Thank you. Get rid of that bastard. Sir, we must get back to the Promethian and radio in our claim. Right. I know you wanted me to trust you. This is exactly why I couldn't. The first duty of any organism is to survive. How can you live with yourself? We're all alone in this universe. Once you've established that nothing hurts. Goodbye. That's a goddamn lie and you know it! Tulwar five coming up to speed. Stand by to receive us Promethean. [crunch sound] [engine roar] [Boom] [gun shot] [gun fire] Promethian, we're under attack! I'm lifting off. I'm out of here. [Engine roar] [Boom] I told you no harm would come to you. Let's get out of here. We've got two Tulwars on the ground here burning. We're lifting off. You'll have to make a run for Tesseran space once you're out of the atmosphere. Your ship is too slow for this work. I know I know. What about you? I still intend to claim that derelict. You can't take em all on. Oh. I think I can. I'm thoroughly trained in the use of these vessels. The Promethian can you carry a maximum of eight Tulwars. I've got one and have taken two out. Plus they lost a third around Inisfree. That leaves four to be dealt with. What about the Promethean? She's a cargo vessel not a military ship. Pretty vulnerable without fighter protection. She's got sophisticated tracking equipment and shrapnel torpedoes. Even you can't evade millions of Steel projectiles. No time to argue. We've got hostiles on our tail. Well I've just lost contact with her. All right we're going to switch a stealth mode. Moseby warns caution. Says she can fly the devil's own daughter. All right, let's take her out. Acknowledged, number one. I'm sorry. You told me was against her programming to disobey orders. That she had no emotions. Look how much damage she's done. Look how much it cost us. We found it necessary to program there with certain emotion otherwise she wouldn't be able to blend in with a populace while on a mission. Hmm? Sir? Yes. Tulwars one and three have been completely destroyed. Tulwars one in three have engaged her and been destroyed. So what do we do now? You're the one who wanted her to be trained to fly combat. She's exceeded all design expectations. Damn. Sir, we have a contact leaving the atmosphere but it's not a Tulwar. Brickman's ship. Have Tulwar seven and eight prepared for launch. Have each of them armed with a 3 Megaton fusion torpedo. Tell the fighter pilots to detonate at those coordinates. She'll try to intercept the fighters in an attempt to save Brickman. The torpedoes will obliterate everything 800 kilometers in all directions. Affirmative, Promethian. Proceeding towards radar contact. We'll launch the missile when Pentan is four hundred kilometers distance. I got a long-range visual sighting. Shit. Two Tulwars. They must be tracking me since your radar invisible. I got him. Transfer to my ship and let's get the hell out of here before it's too late. I told you there won't be a planet in any system where we would be safe if I fail. Trust me. You never admitted it if you trust me. I trust you Brickman. Torpedoes primed for six second fuse. Once I launch we fly like hell before it ignites. That's not much time. At full throttle will be far enough away before it detonates. 600 kilometers distance. Preparing to release device. 500 kilometers. Standby. Firing. Missile away. [Big Explosion.] I'm still here. You all right? Yeah. A bit shaken up. So is the ship. Yeah. Thermonuclear blast. I saw it coming. According to Diagnostics I've lost radar. It's smoking quite a bit. I'm purging the atmosphere. What now? I take out the remaining fighters. Dave? I see her. She's too close to detonate another. Assume formation B. She'll try to divide and take us one at a time. She's right behind me. This bitch is on my tail. I can't shake her. Promethean this is Tulwar 8, I'm requesting permission to dock. I need air cover now. Promethian, this is Tulwar 8, requesting permission to dock. I repeat. I say again requesting permission to dock, over. Promethean, please respond. Sir Tulwar 7 has been destroyed. Tulwar 8 is approaching requesting permission to dock. Is he still armed? I say again, requesting permission to dock. Has he got the warhead, man? Yes, sir. Shoot him down. Fire torpedo! Now! Promethian, look she's ... [Boom.] You waited a millennium for someone to claim you I'm the only one that's left.
