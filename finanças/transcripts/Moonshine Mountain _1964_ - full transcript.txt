What brings Doug Martin, the great television folk singer, all the way down to this hilly country? Gonna take some singin' lessons? - [Laughter] - Or maybe it's just... You just want to get away from that fancy girlfriend in a mink coat and maybe find a new one in, say, rabbit? Or maybe it's just one of them, uh, publicity stunts? Doug, do you think folk music is a passing fad or do you look forward to a lengthy career? Mr. Martin, are you gonna play a club down here? Are you getting married, darlin'? I notice you have a tape recorder there. Come to record the sights and sounds around here? Or maybe swipe a few folks off? [Laughter] Gentlemen, I... I can answer your questions very simply. I have come to this valley... Uh, I have come to this valley to, um... "I have come to this valley to return to the people, as it were." I want to... Yes, "I want to gather new songs "to sing of the people, but more than that, "I want to live with the folk. "Eat and sleep with them. "Get back to the real values. "I want to... "I want to relearn the simplicity of these... "Pleasant, happy people, "Then I will have something worthwhile "to tell with my songs." [Male reporter] Don't you open in Carnegie Hall in about three weeks? Yes, and after that, I go to Las Vegas for 13 weeks... [Reporter] I guess you're anxious to get back to the simple life. [Laughing] Fortify yourself with all that glamor. [Laughter] I, uh, notice you don't have much luggage. Well, I intend to buy what I need from the folk. I will wear their clothing, - eat their food... - Yeah, yeah, I know. "Sleep in their beds." Well... I guess you're anxious to be going. Well, yes, uh... Yes, I have to be going.

Don't you worry none. It's empty. Hey, Harley, did you ever see such a pretty boy? And did you see that fancy jacket he was wearin'? Well, I bet you that cost three or four dollars. Sure is a pretty one. Sure would like to have me some of them fancy kickin' shoes. And I'd to have me some of them fancy clothes. Maybe a car like this. Wow. Uh... I'll be seeing you around, Harley. Yeah? [Engine starts] Hey, mister, that's two cents deposit on that there bottle. [♪ Country music] I'm... I'm sorry, mister. I just wanted to tell you that your rear tire was smoking.

Can't leave you here, you'll burn up to a crisp. He's a heavy boy. Think you be all right here. [Chuckling and panting] I can't take the car! I don't have a car to trade. 'Sides, that'd be stealin'. But it'd do no harm to trade jackets. [Gasps] I don't have no car to trade. [Thump] God damn. [Giggles] [♪ Out of tune guitar] Got hit on the head, huh? I got hit on the head and I wanna call the police. Well, son, I can't says how the police could help you much. You say you don't know the guy who done it. Yeah. Yes, I did. It was the... And all he got was them peculiar lookin' clothes of yours? No, I wouldn't bother much about the police. All we've got around here is a sheriff. And old Asa Potter? Ha! He ain't much at solvin' things. All he wants to do is drink, have a good time. And you couldn't even buy old Asa a drink now, could you? Got no money. Yeah, he got my money and he got my travelers' checks. They won't do him any good, but they won't do me any good either. But he did leave me his bugs. [Laughs] Hell, son, that ain't worth nothin'. Look... I've got to make a phone call. I don't even have a dime. Can you lend me a dime? I wanna call long distance collect and I'll pay you back as soon as I get the operator. Well, stranger...

Hello, operator? I want to make a call to New York City, please. Uptown, 64419. I would like to make it person to person, collect to Joe Warner. You got to what?

Hey, what's the matter, Ed? You trying to scare our company. Come on over here and add some fiddles. You're gonna like old Ed. - He's a regular county fair. - [Laughing] [Indistinct chatter] Ed Basham, you damn fool. You might've scratched a 10 on that boy's brand new guitar.

Let's go now. Come on. Bring that Doug Martin in. Bring that guitar. Let's go. [Jeb] I'm so glad you folks come over today. We're gonna have more pickin' and more fun and more greens and more fiddles. [Laughing] Dougy boy, hope I didn't scare you too bad. See, I gotta keep my shootin' all well. I'll never know when I might have to get off a fair shot at... A federal man. Raf, first time I saw you in that fancy damn coat, why, I damn near shot you for a wild animal. [Laughing] You better make that first shot good, Ed Basham. Doug, did you ever see anything so ridiculous in your whole life as that? [Laughing] I... It looks like a fine jacket, but... I guess it's not right for this country. [Jeb chuckling] Poor Dougy. Had one just like it when he came around this way. And when he realized how out of place he done, he gave it to... Well, he traded it away for somethin' more fittin', didn't you, Dougy boy? - Well, didn't you, Dougy? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whooey! We gotta take this young 'un over to your ma's and see if she'll fix some fiddles for the functions. You know, all this commotion done made me hungry. And I'm getting sick of Mary Lou's cooking. You stick around here, Dougy boy. And I'll marry you off to one of my daughters. [Laughter] [♪ Country guitar music] Why won't it run, Ma? I twirl these things in and it don't do nothin'! [Ma Basham] We ain't got no electric. [Chuckles] Can't run without any electric to it. I don't understand why Ed had taken swap of a dozen chickens, and two bottles of Lightnin' from only half a contraption! Why'd he do that for, Ma? Ha! Ma, why did he take and swap? Well, now, you ask him your own self, honey. [Indistinct conversations] Bully, they're comin' right now! Now you wait, Angeline. I can hear a stranger's voice. Now, you get in that bathroom, Angeline. I ain't gonna have no strangers havin' you. Now, get! [Angeline] Aw! Whooey! [Sighs] Come on in, y'all. Hello, Ma. Howdy!

I'll have some greens in a minute. Well, whooey! You got yourself a new jacket, ain't you, Raf? I sure did. I traded that stranger for it. We told Ed at my place. We could sure eat a dinner. We was bustin' for some of your greens. [Laughter] But I ordered them to have a bit to eat and then all go over to that barn dance. Barn? Then will you have a barn dance? Sure will, Dougy boy. Soon as we have some greens, we'll head down to the barn. I reckon you could do us a favor. You know, Laura, she can do a lot better than these country boys. I reckon if you would do us a real big favor and escort Laura to the barn dance? [Laughter] Reckon I can do you that favor. - [Aweing] - Hey, Pa. I got made the new sport coat now and everything... Can I take Angeline to the barn dance? Well, I reckon you better ask Miss Basham. [Laughter] No point in askin' me, Raf Carpenter. I ain't ready to have Angeline get married, yet. And your Pa ain't ready to have you killed, yet! [Laughter] Take Angeline to that barn dance? Well, this stuff is bound to happen. [Laughter] [Indistinct chatter] All right, go ahead and take her, Raf. But if you should be out of my sight for 10 seconds, they'll be carvin' tombstones tomorrow!

[Inaudible] [Shattering] [Thumping] [Zero] Sheriff Potter, I don't exactly know what's happening, but this is the third time in six months. This fella Price checked in last night. Then about 6:30, he walks out and he ain't been back, yet. He ain't paying his bills and he ain't here. There's been phone calls for him all day. When I tell the man on the other end, he ain't here, he says that's ridiculous. And, Sheriff, it's Washington calling. - And I don't mean tourists. - No, no. Zero, you, you just got to be patient. And when I try to get him to leave a message, they got sort of nasty. So I just hang up. What the hell, it's their nickel. Well, now, Zero, I wouldn't... You wouldn't, but I got a business around here. The Lord hisself knows these fancy Dans from Washington checking in, disappearin' without paying their bills. Hell, I got more luggage around here than a store. Now, I... I will look into it. Now, just take it easy and if there's anything to find out, I'll find it out. Listen, hey, don't you wanna buy one of them suitcases? - Oh, damn! - [Rings bell] What's the matter? Somebody leave without paying his bill? Yeah, third time it's happened. Funny thing, too, every one of them fellas is from Washington. I ain't gonna rent nobody else from Washington a room. They get lost every time. Say, man, you wanna buy some luggage? No. For what I have with me, I don't need luggage. Say, Mr. Martin. Got a phone call for you a while back. I took down a number and you supposed to call back. It's from a long distance. Thank you. [Bell rings] Hello, Miss Dora, are you free now? Can you get me Operator 21 in New York, please? [Della] Yes. Well, operator, it's about time. Douglas? Darling, I've been worried sick. Where are you? Stewartsville? Where in the hell is that? Oh, you're in hell, all right. For how long? Oh, Douglas, you must have lost your mind totally. Well, if you think I'm gonna sit up here and go stark raving mad, you've lost your mind. I will not! I will not, you idiot! Well, you can just do your precious material gathering until the cows come home. And you're... You're just in the one place to see them do that. Well, forget it, buster. You can just take your precious guitar and... I hope Miss Dora didn't hear that. Anybody home? - Hi, Doug. - Hi. How're you doing? Where is everybody? Oh, I guess you might as well know. They're starting to cook the mash this mornin'. Cookin' mash. Laura, what about you? Are you satisfied with... This kind of life? A pretty girl like you? I guess that's a compliment, Mr. Martin. But let's get the record straight. This is my family and I'm proud of it. We're not the yokels you think we are. My Pa sends me to college from September to June. And what's more, I know who you are. Does that answer your question? Laura... What... What do you do for a sweetheart around here? [♪ Country guitar music] Nothing... ...yet. - Anything for me? - Shh. [Doug] Uh, what's... Uh, sweetheart? Uh... Uh, I just talked to you on the phone in... In New York this morning. Why, Douglas, darling, I just hopped on one of them newfangled airplanes and hopped on down to see you all. It don't take hardly no time at all nowadays to check up on a complete idiot! And just where in the hell have you been? I've been sitting around this God forsaken dump since 7:00. I need a drink and this baboon behind the desk tells me that Stewartsville is dry. Didn't say it was dry, lady. I said the sheriff wouldn't allow none of that bar stuff brought in. Della, you could have let me know. I'm sorry. But I've been busy all day collecting material. Material? Material? What kinda material? Mattress digging? Now, what kind of remark is that? You know I... A-ha-ha. I know you and your methods of research, Dr. Martin. Well, you... You have more horns than a herd of rhinoceroses. Rhinoceri. What? Rhinoceri, that's the plural. Not "rhinoceroses". You stay out of this, you old mountain goat. Della, I... I hope you didn't fly down here just to fight. I came down here just in time, it seems to... save you from the clutches of some... hot-blooded hillbilly tramp! Don't worry about how I know or what I know, because a woman's intuition is seldom... Seldom within 5O miles of the truth. - If you think... - What I think, Doug Martin, is that if you're not on the 12:47 flight with me back to New York, then you and I can just forget the whole thing. Then we can just forget the whole thing because I'm not going back until I get what I came after. Oh, you mean, more of what you just got, don't you? Give her hell, mister. - You keep out of this, pinhead! - Della. I'm enjoying myself too much to let you push me around, so, OK, let's forget it. Here, Mr. Folk Music USA. You know, on second thought, I believe I've earned this. Maybe I can hawk it to cover my trip down and back. Happy hunting, Douglas. [Slams door] [Birds tweeting] [Slams door] [Engine starts] Happy hunting, angel. [♪ Suspenseful music] Why, you stupid farmer, you ran me right off the road. Young, young lady, we got laws around these parts. Even if, uh, quite young thing like you breaks 'em, but... But, uh, I'm afraid I've been elected by the people to enforce 'em. What particular law of yours did I break? I wasn't going too fast, or did I... Well, well, well, now, you did it don't matter just what law it was, does it? I... I mean, you know I wouldn't have stopped you for no reason. So, why don't you just slide over a little and let me check you out comfortable, like. Yeah, gonna check you out. Well, do you wanna see my driver's license? [Asa] Hmm? Yeah, yeah, I reckon so. You got one? Oh, of course. Miss? Della Lawrence. From the big city of New York? Well, well, now, it ain't everyday we get any law-breakers from way up there. Will you tell me what law I've broken? I... I wasn't speeding. Will you give me a ticket and let me go? Yeah, well, well, yeah. Now, now, now, Miss Della. Y-You see, bein' as how that... ...we don't have the judge at our beck and call, why... Why, it may take him a few days before he can hear your case and... Well, if I gotta give you a ticket, why... Why, it just might make you miss your plane. - How did you know I had to... - Yeah, uh... The light dawns. Well, Mr. Sheriff. Since you know I have a plane to catch, you must know I haven't any intention of hanging around here. So if a little cash, as a bond of course... Well, uh, Miss Della... Well, you've done hurt me in my civic pride. Yeah, well, I... I wouldn't accept no cash bribe. OK, Sheriff. I get the pitch. Well, whatever it is you want, I guess I'm in your clutches. Yeah, yeah, well, I... I know just the place where you can... Post your bond. Well, anything to uphold justice. Yeah, yeah. - Drive on. - Yeah. [♪ Country guitar tune] [Asa] Come on. Now, Jeb! Raf, Hutto! Now, y'all come on here! What the hell you doin', wakin' up a man this time of the morning for? Now, y'all come on out. We got problems. A federal is coming. [Jeb] A federal? What do you mean, a federal? Now, now, now, you look here, we got problems. Yeah? Now, them federals down in Washington they got all riled up cos they sent down three agents and well, none of 'em come back. Whatever did happen to them three federal fellas, anyhow? Well, now, now, I... I don't rightly know, Jeb, but I do know that I got a wire sayin' that they are sending down two special operatives today for a look see. Now, I'm supposed to give 'em all the help I can. Now, I just want all of you here to just sit tight and don't stir up no fuss. I'll straighten 'em out and send 'em on their way. Me and Luther here, we'll dig out a couple of plans, and... I just want y'all to stay hidden at the still or here at the house. That's all. Now, Luther, come on. [Jeb] Listen, Raf... Better do what he says. Yeah, I reckon better stay around close, hear?

'Course, of course, could be that your men get tired of working and... snuck off without giving any notice. [Wilson] The department told us to come down here and not to come back without positive knowledge of their whereabouts. [Bentley] It's hardly likely that three men would just decide to quit. We're convinced something happened to them. So, you're welcome to come along. We're going to fine-tooth the whole area. We've already questioned the man at the hotel. No luck there. Tried to sell us some luggage. [Laughing] Yeah, well, you know old Zero! He probably got the story confused, you see. He's a little bit mixed up there in the head, you know. And besides, I... Oh! Here comes my deputy now with a report. That's the deputy? I told you! My man just got word of one of your boys just might be found. - Now we can go... - Where? [Stammering] Well, now, Mr. Bentley, we are just gonna have to hope for the best. [Stammering] Now, my deputy don't know for sure, but... but let's get on out there and find out what's going on. Ah, well, Mr. Bentley, I reckon we better take my car. I don't trust anyone driving too fast on them mountain roads. Come on, Wilson. [Car engine starts] [♪ Dramatic music] Right over here. I don't know. Probably someone's buried a hound dog over here. [Laughing hysterically] Well, I think it's two hound dogs. Hmm... Well, I reckon you better start, my little Luther, get rid of 'em. - [Laughing] - Luther. Luther. Wait, who's that? Who's that? That way. I got to get 'em out of here, I'll go see who it is. That's Potter's car. [Asa] Y'all taking a walk? - Yeah, we saw your car... - Get lost! I... I thought I told you to sit tight. I don't like you wandering around here. Get back there in the woods now. Y'all skedaddle before they come back and start asking you questions. Now get! - Come on, Doug, what is it? - Wait a minute. [Laughing hysterically] [Clunk] [Groaning] - [Stomping] - [Bentley screaming] [♪ Dramatic music] [Hatch creaks open] [Moonshine bubbling] [Hatch creaks close] That was Della's shoe. Was that your girl? She was here and we, we had a fight and... I told her I was... I've got to get into town and make a phone call. I've got to call New York. Doug? [♪ Country guitar music] [♪ Music over dialogue] Hello, Joey? Joey, listen, have you heard from Della? No, I don't know. I don't know! Listen, Joey, I'll call you later. She... She's not there. Joey doesn't know where she is. Everybody's calling him. They wanna know where she is, but nobody's heard from her. I knew it. I knew it. You know, there's something mighty funny about this. I figured old Potter knew more than he's tellin' us. You might be right. But maybe not. Thing for us to do is corner old Potter, shake him up a bit. Then ask him about it... ♪ ...when she comes ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain ♪ She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ She'll be driving six white horses when she comes ♪ Well, so much for Mr. Bentley.

Well, Luther... Let's you and me bring him a little trouble, eh? [Chuckles] Well, I... I hate to make extra work for you, Luther, but... Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to dig three new holes. [Stammering] Well, that's right. Ed is your brother. Well... Well, you just never mind, Luther. [Chirping] Well, I'll tell you what. Now... You admire that Mary Lou gal, don't you? Yeah, well, she is right fine. Now, you can get engaged to her regular like, you know, with this ring and all... You just help me out with this little chore, and this ring is yours to give to Mary Lou. Now here's what I figure. Is she all right? She never got back to New York. Something must've happened to her here. Yo, Jeb! Old Potter ain't up to no good! And, Pa, Sheriff Potter took Mary Lou out behind a chicken coop. And hark knows what he done to her. Sorry rascal. At least, could have asked me first. Whooey! That Mary Lou is a funny gal. There ain't no telling how she'd take that. Isn't she worth a cat in this? - She likes it! - [All giggling] I wonder where Luther is. You know, that boy ain't right in the head? Oh, he could get into a bag of trouble staying out this late. [Asa] Oh... That's got uncommon good taste. [Luther laughing] [Stammering] Now we gotta get them all together. Can't get 'em one at a time, they'd get us first. Hey, I got an idea. Come on, Luther, let's you and me go to the office. I'll tell you about it. Sure was fine vittles, Miss Basham. [Chuckles] You cook like an angel. You know, I was just thinking... - As you and I are both alone... - No! With all these lunatics around. Ha! And there comes another one now. [Knocking] Luther says the still's on fire! Damn! You and I have had it! Say you lit that fire! I swore I... It wasn't me that did it! No! It wasn't me that done it. It was Potter. It figures it don't matter who done it. The thing you boys do is get some shovels and axes and get on over there and put it out! Angeline! It's best that you come, too. We're gonna need all the help we can get. - Laura, where's Mary Lou? - She's back at the cabin, Pa. Well, go and fetch her. Take your shortcut. Go through those dry runs. Bring some shovels and axes. Doug, you go along with her. Give her a hand with all those axes. Oi, now get a hustle on! Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Come on, let's go! Mary Lou. Grab an ax! The still's on fire! - No! - Will you come on! [Mary Lou sobbing] [Jeb] Come on! Come on. Yeah. [Ed] There's the still, Papa. [Jeb] Well, the still ain't burning. Somebody done lit a... big picnic fire. [Ed] Yeah. Yeah, but there sure is something funny about this, don't you sure think? Well, reckon we oughta put the fire out anyhow. [Ma Basham] Where's Luther? Now where'd he get to? [Asa] Where are them others? Now, where are the girls and that city fella? Oh, damn, damn it! We gotta get 'em all! No matter. Hey, Luther, build me a fire. [Strikes match] Now... Take this, run up there, and heave it among 'em! [Doug] Luther. Luther! - [Jeb] Here! - [Laura] Let's go get him! [Jeb] Here he comes. Now come on, guys. Come away, now! [Jeb] You get him! [Groans] - [Jeb] Now, here we go! - [Asa] Now, y'all get away! I'll shoot you, one and all! [Jeb] You the one that done it, ain't ya? You killed 'em federal men. And you shot that Yankee woman. You're damn tootin' I done it. Why, y'all ain't got sense enough to do what's gotta be done? You're stupid. Why, you let them federals come in the house and sit and eat at the same table with youse! [Doug] You killed Della! Now, now, she egged me on. She made me do it! [Luther] Here's the bomb! Here's the bomb! Here's the bomb! You blow up! You were gonna kill Mary Lou! [Asa] You fool, you damn fool! - [Gunshot] - [Screams] [Asa] He was the one what done the killing. Well, maybe I told him what to do, but he done the killin'! Well, I killed that Yankee woman! Will you see me killed, Luther? Yellin' like a mad dog, she was. [Mary Lou sobbing] [Asa] Why, you dumb hillbillies! Now he's the one what done the killin'! Now, maybe, maybe I told him what to do, but he's done the killin'. [Raf] Pa! [Asa] Raf, no, you put that gun down! Now, come on, both of you, put that gun down or I'll shoot you right in the gullet! I got four... Five... Five slugs left in here! I'll let you have it! Now, come on! Now, put it down! [Mary Sobs] Now, I want you to move out of here quick! Now, I don't want nobody in my way! I'll shoot you, one and all! I'm leaving. I'm sick of you lily livers! I'm gonna get in my car and leave. [Stutters] Get out of my way. Remember, I killed five men. I killed that Yankee woman. Well, you seen me shoot Luther! Down like a mad dog, which he was! [Screams] [Groaning] [Rumbling] [Screaming] [Splash] [Panting] [Chirping and tweeting] [♪ Country guitar music] [Crying] Well, get back in a few minutes. [Sobbing] [Jeb] Well, get back in a few minutes there, big fella. Bend the rules, Ed. Yeah, the least I can do is give him a Christian burial. [Ma Basham and Mary Lou sobbing] Lordy, Pa, what a mess! - Now what are we gonna do? - Oh, it'll be all right. I'll get you a good lawyer, and it was Potter's gun that killed Luther. Besides, he's been bragging all over town it was his still. And I've got his confession down on this. We'll call the police. Ain't nothing to worry about. No matter what he says. Good mash, too. Would have made good whiskey. I sure hate to see old Doug Martin go. He wasn't a bad fella for a Yankee. And he sure kept us outta a lot of trouble, too. - [Giggles] - Sure did. Well, old Potter didn't make out so pretty good in that inquest. Yeah, you got it right. That inquest. Po... Potter deserved it. He was a... [Breaks into tears] You know... I think Mary Lou's getting better. It's high time, too, because time Laura goes back to school. I'd sure hate to see the expression on old Doug's face when he opens up that guitar case cos I traded him my old one for his new one. [All laughing] [Hutto] Oh, Raf, you should not have done that! Why? Cos he gave Laura that pretty new ring Miss Basham found on Luther, uh. They cost him every bit of 10 bucks. Where is Laura, anyway? I don't know. Reckon she down there with Angeline. We ought to get on down there anyhow. Ma done cooked up a big batch of greens. And we gonna have a big slab of that Virginia ham roll Raf found at the back of that tourister's car! [All laughing] You know, 16 horses couldn't keep me away from your ma's cooking. [Chuckles] Let's get on over there! I'd marry your mother in a minute if I wasn't havin you for a young 'un!

[Chuckles] It's workin'! [Laughing] Miss Basham, we've finished installing your electrical wiring. If it's to your satisfaction, would you please sign this work order? Mr. Martin stressed that you must be pleased. Well, sure, now. Ha-ha! Hell, yes, we're pleased! There ain't never no excitement around here! [Both chuckling] - Now we can all watch some TV! - Thank you, ma'am. I still wonder where Laura went. Y'all ain't seen her, have you? - No. - [Chuckles] [Sighs] Well, that jug'll buy a still, now, Jeb. It'll give somebody some tips. That's some uncommonly fine taste! [Chuckles] You sure do! Wowee! I know an old man and he's got a barn full of copper tubing, and we could... It's about Doug on the TV! Well, what do you know? Come on, then... Martin back from a vacation in the hills said today that he and his bride plan to make their home in New York with frequent trips to Stewartsville. Stewartsville, you may know, is a village about 30 miles from here, and the home of the new Mrs. Martin, the former Laura Carpenter. Martin stated that his wife comes from a family prominent in, uh, alcohol. Anyway, a happy honeymoon. In other news... I reckon we're about the first family in alcohol. [All laughing] No use wonderin' where Laura went. I knew she was too smart to let her man get away. [All laughing] You damn fool, you didn't even know she had an eye on him. I bet you didn't know I had my eye on you, either. The hell I didn't. [Both laughing] [Coughs] [Spits] This here flea juice that our brother-in-law Doug sent us, it ain't fit for a low down hound dog. Huh! Raf. You reckon it's about time we rebuild the still? Yeah, let's get started on that one, Hutto! Ours tastes better. But I sure do like this label better!
