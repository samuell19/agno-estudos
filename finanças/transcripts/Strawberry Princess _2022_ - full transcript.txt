LAYLA JOHNSON: When I was in the fifth grade, the teacher had all the students choose the boy to go out on a date with. At that time, I was shy. I didn't want the boy to know that I really liked him. So, I didn't pick him, to throw him off. I'll pick the ugliest dude in the classroom: Melvin Taylor. Why did I do that shit? Maybe because I didn't feel I deserved the best? Sometimes I think I have Borderline Personality Disorder. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] LAYLA: Hello, class. My name is Miss Johnson, and I'll be teaching you guys, science. LAYLA: I want to try to encourage more of you guys to become scientists. [PAPER BALL THUDDING] [STUDENTS START CHUCKLING] LAYLA: Who threw that? Listen, I'm just here because I'm trying to help you guys learn something. MALE STUDENT: Dressing like that? [CHUCKLING SOFTLY] LAYLA: Young man. Please try to be more respectful. MALE STUDENT: Don't talk to me like that, lady. STUDENTS IN CLASS: [SOFTLY] Mmm. Ooh. LAYLA: I am your teacher, Mr. Noble. Want me to give Miss Noble a phone call? She got no phone. [STUDENTS LAUGHING] MALE STUDENT: She ain't gonna get through anyway. [STUDENTS CHUCKLING] [FEMALE STUDENT CHUCKLING] Anyways, moving on. LAYLA: Can anyone tell me, what are the similarities between animal and plant cell? FEMALE STUDENT: Well, they're... both animal and the plants cells, er, both have a mitochondria. Very good. That's correct, Britney. BRITNEY: Well, thank you. LAYLA: Do humans have chloroplasts? Anyone? BRITNEY: Can a giraffe swim? The answer is no. LAYLA: Yes, that's correct. Only plant cells have chloroplasts. Because plants don't get sugars from eating foods, they have to make sugar in sunlight. Now this process is called photosynthesis. When the... This process is called photosynthesis when the sugar is made in the cell. Because animals don't get... because... Because animals get sugar from the foods they eat, they don't need chloroplasts. Just mitochondria. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] [SIGHS IN RELIEF] Okay. Class dismissed. LAYLA: Please make sure you do your homework. CHILD: Thank you! - FEMALE CLERK: Thank you. - [WOMAN SCOFFS] Boo-hoo! WOMAN: Hello! - LAYLA: Don't worry, I wasn't in a hurry. - FEMALE CLERK: Hello. FEMALE CLERK: What can I help you with? WOMAN: Um, can I get some of the Newports over here? Okay. Thank you. Hi.

How you doing, miss lady? How can I help you? My car wouldn't start earlier. - It's been tripping. - MECHANIC: Tripping? Oh, we can't have it tripping now. So, why don't you pop the hood, and, er... I'll check on it, see what's wrong. It's probably something minor. Get you in. Get you out. That would be great. [SOFTLY] Ooh, yeah. Let's see. Let's see what's going on. MECHANIC: Hmm. MECHANIC: Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Have a few more problems than what you thought. You're going to need a new fuel injection. A fuel injection? MECHANIC: Yeah. LAYLA: Okay. Well, whatever that is. That sounds expensive. This is about $750. No, really. I got to order parts, get parts back, in here, and get you out of here few days or so. You can't do it for cheaper? MECHANIC: No, come on now, miss lady. [CHUCKLING] Four hundred and fifty dollars. That's for the part. I still got to charge for the labor. LAYLA: Damn. Okay. All right. Well, let me get this paperwork for you. Go ahead and sign this. Get it right for you. Mmm-hmm. All right. Got anything else in there that you need to get out? Yeah. Let me grab my bag. Um, so you will give me a call tomorrow? - MECHANIC: I'll give you a call. - All right. - Have a good day. - All right. You too. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Yeah, you too. Mm-hmm. - Aw, she's pretty though. - Mmm. She is. [SIGHS] When I get my stuff together, I'm gonna get Brianna back. LAYLA: You're gonna get her back. And I promise to look out for her no matter what. I'm gonna protect her with my heart. TINA BLACK: I know you will. We're both about to be 18 soon, so we're going to be on our own. And it's not going to be easy. Well, we're gonna stick together. I got your back no matter what. [BOTH LAUGHING] LAYLA: [GIGGLES] No, but for real. Thank you for coming to get me. TINA: Girl, it's the least I can do. You know you're the sweetest person I know. I don't know about all that. How is your son, his daddy, Joseph, been holding on since he got custody of Anthony? I can barely pay the support bill with my teacher's salary. Sometimes it's just hard to maintain. Hang in there. And you know, if you need anything, I got you. Tina, you mind if I crash here tonight? LAYLA: I should be moving into my apartment soon, - and I'm... - Yes, girl. Of course. I'll go get you some blankets, something to sleep in. [GLASS BREAKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [KEYS THUDDING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Come on. What are you doing? MAN: Just let it happen. - LAYLA: Get off me! No! - MAN: Shh! You're gonna wake my wife. [SOFTLY] Suck my dick. LAYLA: [SHOUTING] Are you high? What the hell is wrong with you! MAN: Don't fight it. Don't fight it. [KISSING] Walking around with you. LAYLA: [MUFFLED SCREAM] Stop! - LAYLA: Tina's my best friend! - MAN: You ain't gonna say shit. Come on. I know you want it. [KISSING] LAYLA: Get off me! LAYLA: [SHOUTING] Move! [PANTING] [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING FROM CAR] MAN: Hey, lady. Hey, lady! Hey! Can I get a cigarette? LAYLA: Yeah. MAN: You got a light? LAYLA: Yeah, sure. Thank you, lady. What are you doing out here so late at night? LAYLA: What? MAN: I hate to do this to you. You're such a nice lady. [LAYLA SCREAMS] [SHRIEKING] Hey! Like, come on, man! [SHOUTING] Why would you do that? [SOBBING] [INHALING AND SIGHING] [SIGHING IN DESPAIR] [SOFTLY] Oh, shit. How are you doing today, Miss Johnson? I'm doing fine. Thanks, Ben. Are you sure? Because I'm a street nigger. I got a feel for the streets. I know all about the streets. I know about pain. You can't fool me. I seen all kind of pain. Did you do your homework? You can't fool me, Miss Johnson. You can't fool me. LAYLA: Hello, class. Everyone get to their seats. So, today is extra credit day, where I'm going to be giving five points, to whoever can come up here and give their presentation to the class. Who's first? I need them credits. LAYLA: Okay, Cheryl. CHERYL: My product is a cold drink that you drink. And when you drink it, your depression goes away. No more depression for the day. It's called "Glow up for the flow up". Yeah, until you throw up. [ALL LAUGHING] CHERYL: Fuck you, nigga, and the boat your parents came here on. It don't work for dumb niggas anyways. Sit down. LAYLA: Okay. Cheryl gets her five points. Thank you, Cheryl. Sit down. Who's next? I'll go. LAYLA: Okay, Sweetie. My company as a service is basically for really wealthy people who need their B12 shots. We drive to those patients and give them a shot, then they're better. Bam! That's it, that's all. Take that to the bank and we are in the house. My company is called, "Who shot you, B?" [STUDENTS APPLAUDING] [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] LAYLA: Oh, okay. Class dismissed, you guys. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow. WOMAN 1: Look, it's either I do this, or my kids don't eat. And now, you choose. WOMAN 2: I don't know another place I can make 100 bucks for five minutes. WOMAN 1: I know. That's right. Yeah. [ALL CHUCKLING] WOMAN 3: Yeah, why you owe that guy only 300 dollars. HAIRDRESSER: I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. So what can I do today? LAYLA: Well, I guess I can get a shampoo and a rinse. HAIRDRESSER: Mmm-hmm. Okay. HAIRDRESSER: Oh, girl. You don't want no parts of that lifestyle. That fast money is not always good money. Now that lifestyle comes with a lot of problems. Trust me, I've been there. You know, you have really beautiful hair. You really do. Thank you. I try to maintain it, but it's very difficult when you working six days per week. HAIRDRESSER: Hmm. No, I understand. So who used to do your hair? Um, Ebony over on Hoover Street. She used to do my hair. HAIRDRESSER: [SOFTLY] Okay. Uh... Are you in college? [LAYLA TITTERING] LAYLA: Oh, God, no. Do I look that young? HAIRDRESSER: Well, actually, you do. LAYLA: Well, I was in college for years, but, girl, that was back in the day. Mmm. Well... I don't know about that. I mean... HAIRDRESSER: You know, I tried college. But if "college is not for everyone" was a person, I am that person. That... I mean, I'm not complaining or anything, because I'm so cool with making $400 a day. And that's without booth rental. LAYLA: Shh... girl, you're doing real good. Make a lot more than I do. HAIRDRESSER: If you don't mind me asking, what do you do for a living? Uh, I'm a school teacher over at East Crenshaw. I teach science. HAIRDRESSER: Oh, hell no! [TITTERING] I mean, I'll support our educators and all, but [SIGHS] having to deal with all them badass kids all day. Mmm-mmm. [SIGHS] Not the one. Are you okay? Yeah, um, I'm fine. Oh, okay. Let me know if you need anything. MECHANIC: Hey, miss lady, your car is ready. It's $750. I only have $250. [SOFTLY] See, right there, that's a problem. Now look, you got... you got 30 days to pay for it, or... or, it's going to be my car, because I'm gonna put a lien on. And you ain't gonna have no car. MECHANIC: I'm gonna need the full $750. Come on, man. Cut me a break. - No, no, no. Mmm-mmm. - Let me make some payments. No, no, no, no. You see? You see... You see right there on the door? It's clear as day. We don't accept payments. No, we don't do cheques. We don't do no IOUs. It's cash, or credit. Okay. Come on, mister. I need my car to go back and forth to work. Look, I understand you need the entire payment, but I just don't have it. MECHANIC: Again. I don't do payments. All right? This is a business. This ain't no charity. Okay? You know, I come to work every day. I work hard, I pay my bills. I do what I can with all these cars, getting all this damn grease under my nails. I mean, what's in it for me? Hmm? I can pay you $250 right now, and $250 for each month - until the bill is settled. - MECHANIC: Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No. You need to read that sign again, baby girl. Look, I tell you what. How about you go down there to that cheque cash-in-advance place on 48th Street. Get you a cash advance. Come on down here. Give me my money. And everything else will be fine, It'll be taken care of. Okay. I guess I'll try that. I'll be back tomorrow. And I'll be here. MISS JONG: Complete the back. MISS JONG: I need two forms of ID. Do that part. In case of emergency. Tina Black. My foster sister. MISS JONG: Put it there. Right there. You feeling okay? You good job. You schoolteacher. Make good money. LAYLA: I'm sorry. I'm just feeling a little tired. Here's your keys. Just you. Yes. Just me. Thank you. FEMALE REPORTER ON RADIO: There were clashes between LAPD officers and protesters last night after people came out to mark the one year anniversary of the death of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. It initially started peacefully, then scenes like this played out near Hollywood & Vine. FEMALE REPORTER 2 ON RADIO: Today, family of a man who was shot and killed, as well as their legal representation. [FEMALE NEWS REPORTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] And authorities say that this man was shot. He assaulted a deputy, they alleged, and also was in possession of a firearm. They say they are investigating. Ew. FEMALE NEWS REPORTER ON RADIO: We are live this evening in front of the 77th community police station that is investigating that shooting involving that six-year-old girl. They say two men drove up in a car. One got out and opened fire on that crowd. Tonight, neighbors want answers. You, open up this door, Miss Johnson! You open up this door! LAYLA: Hold on! I'm coming! MISS JONG: You take this! What is this? Three day notice. Wait, what? MISS JONG: You know what this is. Stop playing with me. You schoolteacher. You make money, you pay rent! I pay more than just rent. I pay my student loans. I pay child support and a lot more other stuff, Mrs. Jong. Me, no care. You pay rent. [SHOUTING] You pay rent right now or you go. I'll have it. I get paid today. Don't be banging on my door like that. Me no run a charity here. You pay rent. Everybody needs to pay rent. Hey. Hey. So... you know today is your last day. Tomorrow I'm gonna put a lien on your car. It'll be mine. So I hope you brought me some money. Sugar, it's only $335. LAYLA: That's all I got. I need my car. You really pretty. Would you let me get a taste? You can have your car for free. Hmm? Is that what you want? MECHANIC: [WHISPERING] You want the car, don't you? You promise? [SOFTLY] Yeah. You know, I ain't never did nothing like this before, but you're so pretty. Look at your fine self. I'll make this my first time. MECHANIC: Come on. [WHISPERING] Come on. [WHISPERING] Come on. There you go. [SOFTLY] I take my time. Come on. [MOANING IN PLEASURE] Oh, shit. Damn. [MOANING IN PLEASURE] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Damn. Should have thought about this shit earlier. [GRUNTING] [EXHALING] You promise not to tell anybody? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Yeah. Nah, we're good. So I never asked to be here. They all told me everything was going to be all right after overcoming living in foster homes and being molested. I got a surprise for y'all. You'll never guess. That grease monkey laying on top of me wasn't the worst thing I've ever experienced. I'm starting to believe I'm a lesbian. And I only want the soft touch of another woman. SOCIAL WORKER: Supervised visitation is when the child is under the supervision of another individual. That'll be you. SOCIAL WORKER: You both chose the spot that we're at today, and we have to make the best of it. It's for the best interests of the child. MR. JOHNSON So what have you been doing all this time? I mean, don't you want to say hi to your son? LAYLA: I said hi and gave him a hug before we came in. I don't know where you were. Were you in the bathroom or something? MR. JOHNSON: I was sitting right here. I don't even see why we have to be here in the first place. SOCIAL WORKER: Mr. Johnson, it's a court order, so you know the reason that we're here. Again, it's for the best interests of the child. MR. JOHNSON: And you are behind your child support payments, again, Layla. LAYLA: I work every day, Joseph. Now get off my back! I came here for these visitations and... I've been having a hard time, okay? You don't know what I've been going through. LAYLA: And I know you don't care. It's not about care. JOSEPH: It's not about if I care for you or not. It's about our child. And I'm a single father now. Okay? It is... [SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION] JOSEPH: It's all because you couldn't get your stuff together. Hey, son. I'm working everyday, okay? I'm in the process of getting everything together. And it won't be long now. You'll see. Because the last thing we need is empty promises. I mean, come on. More empty promises from his mother? That's the last thing we need. I... I have to chime in here, Ms. Johnson. You're supposed to be talking to and interacting with your son. There's a time and a place for everything, and now is not the time or place for y'all to be arguing. All I want is for us to be a family. LAYLA: I want my son to grow strong, smart, and confident. I'm on his side, if you ever can understand. And I'm going to show you. Hey, son. I brought you these books. I want you to read them and email me, and let me know what you think about them. Promise me you'll never let anybody say bad things about me. All I need for you is to trust me. I have your back. I'm looking out for you. And you're the reason I'm working every day on this planet. So that one day, you'll be back with Mommy. JOSEPH: You know, you need to stop being so nice to people. Come on, son. Grab your book. Let's go. It's not a good look. LAYLA: I was next. You need to get in the back of the line. LAYLA: Let me get a pack of cigarettes. FEMALE CLERK: All right. Anything else I can help you with? - That's it. Just a pack of cigarettes. - All right. All right, $7.95. FEMALE CLERK: Thank you. Anything else? Would you like a lighter? Nope. Have a good one. [GULPING] [COUGHING] [COUGHING] [COUGHS] [SIGHING] [GULPING] [EXHALING] [EXHALES QUICKLY] [SLURPING] [GULPING] [COUGHING] [COUGHING] [EXHALES] MAN IN CAR: Hola. MAN IN CAR: Como estas? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Just trying to give you this chocha. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Because I took Spanish, asshole. LAYLA: That's why. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] LAYLA: I'll admit, I was a little drunk. Maybe I shouldn't be out there at all. There is no reason for it. Look at you. You're beautiful. You're educated. You're funny. Why don't you just find a husband? Already did that. It didn't work out. I'm used to taking care of myself, and, never really want to depend on a man for anything. It's, uh, it's oddly refreshing. Well, "China", I really hope you figure it out. And that's what I'm doing, is figuring it out. I'm in this place, with a stranger. I think it sort of fits the bill of figuring it out. So, what do you want to do? Since I don't think you're a police officer anymore. What's this? I'm paying you for your time. There, take it. It's yours. Hey. I can't do that. Um, oh! And... If you ever need anything, call me. No. It's okay. [SIGHS] All right. Would it make you feel any better if I said, um... I don't like to have sex with women who are intoxicated. Mmm. I guess that makes sense. Then, take the money. LAYLA: Okay, but, don't try to think that you can come back later and get freebies. It don't work like that. I wouldn't dare. Make sure you call me. You need something, you reach out. Let me tell you something, Mr. attorney. You don't want to get involved with me. You may think you like me. It'll fade away. You don't want to get involved with a girl like me. You just don't. Thank you for everything. Well, uh, I will definitely try not to push myself on you. If you need something, just call me. Okay. I'll call you if I get into a car accident. Um... Actually, I'm a criminal attorney. So... Take care of yourself, "China". MAN: Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. I knew it. WOMAN: What? [IMPERCEPTIBLE] Check your cellphone. Check it. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Why are you calling me this early in the morning, Joseph? Are you calling to shake me down this early in the morning? [LOUDLY] I told you I'd have your money soon. [ANGRILY] Damn! Can you get off my back? [SHOUTING] No, I don't want to go to jail! Who would want to go to jail? What kind of question is that? [SHOUTING] It's too early in the morning for this shit. [CELL PHONE THUDDING] [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] [SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION] LANDLORD: Miss Johnson! Rent? Here you go. MISS JONG: Hold on. Wait a minute, Miss Johnson. This is not enough money! You owe me more money than this. This is not enough! You know what? Just take that money. I'll have your money by the end of the week. Okay? Okay. Just this one time. Just this one time. All right. Have a nice day. You too. [SARCASTICALLY] Have a nice day. Ben. Your work is in front of you. LAYLA: Mind your business, stop staring at me and do your schoolwork. Schoolwork, Ben. LAYLA: Put that book away. Stop writing raps in my class, and stop reading books that have nothing to do with my class. Do that on your own time. BEN: No problem, Miss Johnson. I'll put these pimp books away. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] LAYLA: Okay, class. Make sure you turn in your papers. LAYLA: Thank you. STUDENT: Here you go, Miss Johnson. [STUDENT MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] LAYLA: Goodbye, Fred. I "seenk" you. It's "I saw you." LAYLA: And what are you talking about, Ben? Class is dismissed. You're excused. Don't you have somewhere else you need to be? BEN: I saw you with that trick the other night in the diner. I saw you too. And? I knew you was a whore. [SNICKERING SOFTLY] Yo, I would never have guessed it. I can't believe it! My teacher is a whore. LAYLA: Come on, Ben. Just because you see me at a diner late at night doesn't make me a whore. There's 14 million people in this city. And men and women date all the time. What you need to stop doing is reading those outdated Donald Goines books that got your imagination running wild. By the way, what I do in my personal life, and outside of this classroom is none of your damn business. And whatever involvement that you've got with these young girls, needs to stop, because you don't know whose baby you got out there. BEN: What you're saying? What I'm saying is, grow up, Ben. Don't forget to turn in your paper. [PERSON KNOCKING ON CAR DOOR] - [KNOCKING ON CAR DOOR] - WOMAN: Hey. Hey! WOMAN: You know it's not safe to be out here like this, right? Why are you sleeping out here? You work over here? I ain't never seen you here before. WOMAN: Hold on. I know you from somewhere. - [CLICKS TONGUE] - Ah. You're the girl who was staring at me down at the beauty shop from Crenshaw. Yeah, I remember you. I've seen you too. By the way, - you're super pretty. - Oh! Thank you! You're pretty too. Whatcha doing over here? LAYLA: Came to audition. WOMAN: Do you want to work here? Good as any other place. I don't know. I don't really know no new girls making no money. Especially after you pay your fees and stuff, you're left with so little, especially on a slow night like this. Yeah, only the OGs and regulars are making money, so... I just want to make some extra money. Damn, girl! What's all that you got in there? Let me get some of that. Why you got this just sitting on your lap? I could've robbed you. What's your name? LAYLA: "China." That's not your name. Are you going to tell me your real name? - Layla. - Layla? [SNIFFING] - Why are you sleeping in your car? - [WOMAN SNIFFING] Stressed and nervous. I wanted to come to the audition and... I don't know. I guess I did a little too much tonight. You need to be nervous about this coke. That's some bad coke. WOMAN: Okay. This, er... LAYLA: Yeah. Okay. You look nervous. You ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. - You're going to do fine. All right. I'm going to be right out front. Okay? Remember what I told you? Let's go. You've got it, little booty. MALE ANNOUNCER: Shine! Come, guys. It's her first time here on the stage. Let's show her some love. WOMAN: We got this. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] There you go. There you go. Yes! Come on. You're welcome. Fuck this! Layla, wait! Hey, what the fuck are you doing? You know you can't work here now, right? I don't care. You know what? This is some bullshit. You're the only one who tipped me tonight. I'm sorry, but we still cool? Yeah, we still cool. LAYLA: Yeah. It's all right. As long as you're good. Let me worry about it. You can make some money. You know what? We can go to the play tonight, make some real money. - I... - Don't worry about it. It's easy. I'll teach you. I'll show you the ropes. Uh. You got somewhere to go change? Yeah, We can go to my apartment. I'm gonna text you the address and meet me over there. WOMAN: Okay. LAYLA: All right. See you in a minute. - LAYLA: Okay. - WOMAN: You good? - LAYLA: I'm good. - WOMAN: You sure? - LAYLA: Yes. - WOMAN: All right. I'll get some Henny. LAYLA: Okay. I'm texting you right now. All right. I don't think you need the belt. - LAYLA: No. - WOMAN: Just make the... Damn! WOMAN: You got some amazing titties. Did you get them done? LAYLA: No, girl. They're natural. - WOMAN: For real? No bullshit. - LAYLA: No bullshit. - WOMAN: Lying. - LAYLA: You don't believe me? LAYLA: Mmm-mmm. LAYLA: They drug test at school. WOMAN: What school you go to? LAYLA: [GIGGLES] I'm a teacher at East Crenshaw. Like a real teacher? [GIGGLING] Yes. Damn bitch. Why you ain't tell me? I don't know. I didn't think it was that important right off. Ah. See, I knew it was the reason I really liked you. How was I? [WOMAN SIGHS] WOMAN: Never been with a girl before have you? [WOMAN CHUCKLES] LAYLA: Dang. You can tell. I, yeah, no. But it's fine, Layla. You'll learn. Just look... Did good. You did good. You did great, all right. What do you think, though? At least. I think I'm in love. What's that song? Don't lie. [GIGGLES] All right. So I'm gonna teach you a few things. So, you'll be out here looking like a pro and won't attract no pimps. So, tonight I am the teacher, you the student. - WOMAN: Okay? - LAYLA: I'm all ears. Right. So, you gonna want to always use condoms. And you want to open it with your mouth and put it on yourself. You're going to take it with your mouth and hold it with this thing and slide it on down. Okay? That way you ensure that he doesn't touch the condom. And you control all the germs. You know how to suck dick, right? Yeah, but not that good. Okay. [LAYLA LAUGHS] Okay. Just use a lot of spit and just control both your hands like you're jacking them off. And he's gonna be so into your pretty ass that he's gonna come quick. We also need to choose some KY jelly to put in your pussy, so your pussy won't wear out. And always act like you're on the phone with your pimp if a questionable nigga pull up. Any questions? What's the pimp's name? A big black nigga with a big ass gun. Because everybody is scared of big black ass nigga with a big ass gun. Oh, God. You got it. Let's walk. WOMAN: Women pay the most. LAYLA: If she's daddy, mommy. LAYLA: I call everybody a daddy. WOMAN: Yeah, she is a daddy. Your turn. Wanna play? Sure, why not? You look a little nervous. First time. I like virgins. There you go. Don't be scared. I don't bite. All right. I'm Coco.

COCO: Keep the money... BEN: How you get me out of bed at three in the morning? LAYLA: We needed help. - BEN: Help with what? - LAYLA: With that. BEN: Who's that? LAYLA: That was an accident. BEN: Who's she? LAYLA: That's my friend. How the fuck you calling me, lady? Because I know you're from the streets and we needed help. I thought you hated me. Why would I hate you? How do you know I won't go to the police and rat both of you out? Send you both to prison. Because it's a street code. We got this. How much is here? LAYLA: 80... 100,000 in cash. I don't know. We didn't count it. I won't do it until you admit that you are a whore. Tell me you are a hoe. Can you just tell him, please? Why is that so important to you? Little something I picked up in the books I've been reading. LAYLA: Mmm-hmm. I can't hear you. LAYLA: I'm a hoe! I'm a hoe, too. Okay? All right. Who the fuck is that? That's Walter. Got shot in the head. - BEN: You shot him? - COCO: No, I shot him. Damn. Let me see... We're going to need you to help us pick up his body, put it in the trunk, so we can take him to the woods. He was too heavy for us to carry. That's it? That's it and all this is yours. Wait. Wait a minute before we do all that. Get the gloves. Why I need those? I was going to pick his ass up and put him in the trunk. Because I'm a science teacher. Forensics. You don't want to get your DNA on that. Good thinking, teach. Wait. I want to see who you two hoes killed. Okay, Oh, hell no! Cover his ass back up. We're going to jail. What? You already know what. Just stick to the plan. Everything will be all right. I cannot believe Walter was drug dealing out the mechanic shop. Are going to be all right? Yeah, I just... I never killed nobody before. LAYLA: Hold on. Don't ever say that again. Just stick to the plan and keep doing what you do every day. Okay. SYLVIA: Hi, Layla. How are you, Miss Johnson? It's been a while since we talked. Would you like a sip for old times? Okay. So, what's happening? Child, these students like to talk a lot. And they are spreading rumors all around school. About me? Yes, girl. What's going on? Is there any truth to these ridiculous allegations? Sylvia, what allegations are we talking about? They are saying you are a prostitute down on Figueroa street at night. [LAYLA GIGGLES] Oh silly. I'm not a prostitute, but I do work for an organization, a non-profit where I sometimes go help young girls who are in need. You understand? Goddamn, girl. You scared me for a minute. [LAUGHS] SYLVIA: Mmm... SYLVIA: It's fine. - LAYLA: Okay. - SYLVIA: Yeah. I'm actually out helping one young lady right now, helping her get off the streets, get her some housing and things like that. SYLVIA: Mmm. Well, at least that is out of the way. [LAYLA EXHALES] These kids have an unbelievable wild imagination, especially at this age, so it's no surprise. [SIGHS] I have my own issues with my husband lately. It was our anniversary two weeks ago and I was reading the paper and I saw his name in the paper with another woman. And when you look at the topic, it was new parents. Damn near killed me. Sylvia that's terrible, and I hate to hear that. LAYLA: Gosh. He seemed like such a nice man. Mmm. He was nice as long as he was getting that hot young thing across town. I got old. Aging. It's a cruel thing. Getting older seems like some sort of punishment. An older woman like me, it's going to be harder for me to start all over again. I mean, look at you, Layla. You're young and beautiful and I'm glad you're out here doing the right thing, helping the sisters and keep up the good work. But your class test scores are not bad, but they could be better. I need you to work on that. This is East Crenshaw and a lot of these kids don't come here to learn. You know, it's not their fault, but they got problems at home. And they just see so much. But you're right. I could do better. [SYLVIA EXHALES] SYLVIA: Okay. Well, I got a meeting with the superintendent, so I will circle back around to you. [EXHALES] And we'll do a check to make sure that the kids in your class's test scores don't suffer. LAYLA: Okay, great. Well, it was nice seeing you again. And Sylvia, take care of yourself. And if you ever need anything, please give me a call. Thank you. That was very nice. Child, I might take you up on that. PAUL: Go, baby. Come on. Ah! That excites. Come on. [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Okay, sweetheart. Thank you very much. Once again. You got my money? As a matter of fact, I do. Here you are. Thank you. - PAUL: Ben. - BEN: Yeah, what's up? I got something to show you. Follow me. BEN: What's that? It's my collection. My coin collection. Damn, you're making bank, huh? Well, I do all right. Something that I've been saving for a while now. Can I touch it? Yeah, sure. Uh. That's probably lunch. You ordered fried chicken? PAUL: Yeah. Why you do that? I like fried chicken. Don't you? I do. PAUL: Great. PAUL: Dig in. So Paul, tell me about those coins. What are they? This is one of a set of four. We're talking 2006 gold eagles. Certified first strike, P F700. BEN: Oh, yeah. Sounds good. BEN: What do all that mean? Is it worth anything? PAUL: Uh... A little under 30,000 on a good day, you know, the value varies. BEN: Amazing. Gold eagles. I always thought gold eagles were worth 50. In essence they are, but these are collectibles in perfect mint condition. BEN'S MOTHER: Ben! Yeah, Mom? BEN'S MOTHER: Make sure you get your clothes ready for school tomorrow. Okay. Look at this. Wait to see me on Instagram with this bitch, home boy. That shit's fire. That price tag though. Yeah, I've been saving. Planning on paying straight cash. Well, I told you, I'm down. So, just make sure that money there. The money is there, homeboy. Got no reason to lie to you. All right. Well, you say you know this guy? Yes, I know the guy. We eat dinner with him all the time. He take pictures of my girl, and pay us a lot of money. He's loaded. Well, if he's loaded, why he still living in the hood? Not the hood. They gentrifying all that shit over there. He live on slots land. Train by the train tracks. Warehouse, studio. Hey. You mean to tell me he got hundreds of thousands of dollars in this studio? BEN: Yeah. That is why I need you. I need someone to come and put the safe one's with the dollar, load it onto the truck. That's it. We take the safe somewhere and crack it open. Split the money. You go your way. I go mine. All right, then we're gonna need a truck. I think my uncle got a U-Haul. I can probably get that. All right, I'm in. BEN: Bet. FRED: This might work. Layla, I really don't have shit to say to you. I don't even know why I came here. You mentioned Brianna, so I had to come see what's going on. Brianna's out there with one of my students. Any he has her on the streets doing all kinds of stuff. She doesn't even know who I am. But I wanted to tell you what was going on because we made a vow that I would help take care of her. So, I'm keeping my promise. She's doing what, Layla? The same shit you out there doing? Yeah, I know what you're doing. Being a teacher is just a cover, huh? That's why you tried to fuck my husband for money. He told me. I really don't have shit to say to you. You're a little bitch, Layla Johnson. And I don't want anything to do with you. LAYLA: I know you truly don't believe that deep down in your heart. We go back since foster care together. We've been together through thick and thin, and I know you truly don't believe that. I believe my husband. Why are you so busy worried about my kid, when you don't even have yours? Call somewhere with that bullshit. What is it that you really want? You know what, Tina? You've changed. I am still the same person. Yeah, I got sidetracked. I just want what's best for Brianna. I can't see her out there on the streets. I don't want her out there like me, that's for sure. I just wanted her to have a better childhood than we did. I was so proud of you when you got your bachelor's degree and became a teacher. I thought you were going to be so incredible, so important. Lately. I don't know who you are. You're not that bashful, timid girl you were before. I don't have shit to say to you. But if it means anything, thank you for telling me about my child. But she's considered an adult in the State of California. She's 18. LAYLA: You really are cold blooded. You know that? I really wish you would just see the truth. DETECTIVE: Let me stop fucking around. Give me your side of the story. It'll be better for you in court. BEN: What if I get a lawyer? You asking for a lawyer? Because if you're asking for a lawyer, that means we have to stop talking. Which means I can't help you. What do you mean, you ain't gonna help me? You watch enough television to know exactly what I'm talking about. So stop fucking around. Tell me what you want to do. BEN: I know I'm in some serious trouble. I already know that. DETECTIVE: And I'm not gonna bullshit you. Ben, you are in some serious trouble. I just got a call from the hospital. It seems your friend Fred, the person who you committed this crime with has passed away. BEN: What do all that mean? What that have to do with me? It has everything to do with you because you decided to do a murder. Excuse me, a robbery. You committed a robbery with Fred. You went to Paul's house, you stole the man's safe, put it on the truck. Paul comes out protecting himself and his property. You just heard shots and floored it. You don't know if he's dead but you rolled right over Fred's head and the poor man is dead now. And you did his murder. So sorry. That's just California law. Hi, Ben. I'm Marcy Washington. I'm the district attorney. My badge number is 45764. Nice to meet you. Okay, so then tell me what you told Detective Denwood earlier today. How you doing? Are they treating you okay? I'm doing all right. Okay, so tell me about the school teacher and the murder. All due respect Miss Washington, I need for sure that you can give me a deal on the situation I'm in now. I'm 20 years old. I'm not trying to be a old-head getting out of prison. Well you're currently being charged with murder for your classmate Fred. How much time do that carry? MARCY: Life. See, I'm not trying to do life. What deal can you give me, Miss Washington? If everything you say is accurate and you tell the truth and we don't find any lies in your testimony here today, I could possibly talk to my boss and get it down to 25 years. It depends on your truthfulness. My teacher Miss Johnson. At East Crenshaw High, text me one night. I still have the text message. She said, "Come through and get rid of this body." I'm like, okay. It was at this mechanic shop. 164 on Cooper Avenue. MARCY: Okay. So tell me more. Can I call my mother first? I'll let you call your mother after. MARCY: Okay? BEN: He was already dead when I got there. And the other girl, Coco, she was there. All my job was to do, get the body, drag it, put it in the trunk. We'll take it to the hills and dump it. No bullshit. Are you sure you didn't kill him? - I didn't kill nobody. - Well, where's the money? What money? The money that you stole from Walter. The guy that you guys killed. Look, lady, I didn't kill that motherfucker. He was already a corpse. I'm innocent. Okay, so finish telling your story and relax. Go arrest that teacher. We can't go in there and arrest her. She's the pillar of our society. She's a murderer and a hoe. Okay. So what we need you to do is put a wire on and go in there and have her say something incriminating. - Okay. - Okay, but wait, first, I want you to show us where that money is, and I want you to turn it in. Okay, I'll show you. I was saving for my BMW. That's my dream car. You were teaching about science. What about teaching about murder? What are you talking about? Everything okay with you, Ben? You know exactly what I'm talking about, Miss Johnson. Hmm. No idea. The murder. A damn mechanic? The body you made me take to the truck. You have a wild imagination. What do you mean? - LAYLA: Come over here. - For what? Just come here. What's up, Miss Johnson? I have no interest in you like that. What's going on? What's that? I knew you were weak. All that hard core of pimping young girls and gang banging was just all a facade. You know what you are? You're nothing but a coward. What was I supposed to do? You don't give a fuck about me. I got called up. It was gonna be you or me. What you think? You know who you're pimping? One of my close friend's daughters, Brianna. That's where you fucked up! You know her? You damn right. And you gonna pay because you set me up. I knew you were a straight bitch. Get the fuck out of my face. Johnson. This is Detective Denwood, Robbery Homicide Division. Would you be so kind as to come down to the 77 Police Precinct here in Los Angeles? We're following up on an investigation, and we have some questions we'd like to ask you. Thank you. [DETECTIVE SIGHS] Hmm. BEN: What the hell is going on? What do you mean, Ben? That's the dead guy in the room with my teacher. Who? I asked Miss Johnson down here to corroborate your story. That's her attorney in the other room. Nope, that's the dead guy. What kind of games you guys playing on me down here? That's the dead guy. That's the dead guy the girl shot. That's the dead guy. That's the dead guy I put into the truck. Hold up, hold up. You trying to tell me the guy sitting in the other room is the dead guy? No, way. Buddy, let me show you something. That's not the dead guy. That's not him. SAM: There is nothing he said to you detectives that makes any sense at all. And my client is a law abiding schoolteacher. She's been working at East Crenshaw for three and a half years now. And these allegations have no merit whatsoever. DETECTIVE: I have her student Ben, in the other room. And he says that Miss Johnson is involved in the death of Walter. But seeing as his story is starting to fall apart because now he is saying, you are the dead person. Do I look dead to you, Eric? No, Sam, you don't. Something stinks here. Yeah, so is my client free to go? - Yeah. - Thank you. But something's not right about her. I just can't prove it now. Miss Johnson don't leave town. [EXHALES] Well, if you have that young man in custody, I suggest you have him checked out by a psychiatrist. DETECTIVE: Sure thing. SAM: Thank you, Eric. Since you accepted me as a client, the attorney client privilege kicks in, right? [EXHALES] Yes, it does. [CLEARS THROAT] So how much is this? That's 25,000. And there's another 25,000 when you do a little something for me. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] - LAYLA: Be good. - SWEETIE: Okay. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [LAYLA CLEARS THROAT] Hey, you. TINA: Hey. I came to say goodbye. Are you leaving town? Yeah. Me, my girlfriend and my son. You got your son back? - Yep. - That's what's up. And I'm sorry that I didn't believe you before. But I got somebody back also. Really? I know you had a lot to do with it. Hey, Layla. Hey, sweetheart. She told me everything. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I'll stay in touch. All right. Bye, guys. -TINA: We'll come visit -LAYLA: You better. [ALL CHUCKLE] WOMAN ON RADIO: Vehicle suspect 540 South Commonwealth Avenue. Male oriental white clothing. Male Hispanic as per the description. Cream color Mercedes. [POLICE CHATTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]
