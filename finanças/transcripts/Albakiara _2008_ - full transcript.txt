Can I tell you about another one of my gangster evenings? You sure? You don't mind? So, that evening I felt like smoking... guess where! In the bathtub. I was with Micky e Zippo. Completely naked. And then... well, I felt something on my back. Fuck, it was Zippo's hard cock! Then I was like: 'well it happens, we're naked. ' So I stepped out of the bathtub and started dancing and touching myself. Then Micky walked up to me. ...he started grabbing me, kissing, hugging... ...and then... well... he... ...and he put it in my mouth... then Zippo came closer and he put it in my mouth too. I swear... that was so gross... ew! But I was so high I sucked them both off. (Alex) Careful now. (Alex) Once I step out you'll follow me. Look at me! You need to hit me hard, but not here. Nor here. You gotta hit me here, on the back of my neck. Got it? If you fuck up... I'm dead. You have six minutes, tops, to get out of the court... ...after that..."you're fucked". (cellphone) # what are you up to? come on, pick up! # # you've got a call # Hello? Yeah. I'll be back soon. Yeah, Vincenzo is here, he says hi. See you later. Bye now. My mom. She's a pain in the arse. She worries if I don't call... See you tomorrow. We'll meet here in two days, with the dope Let's go. (Maria) You going back to New York after the heist? Yeah, back home. I'm more American than Italian, you know that. Plus, I have some unfinished business in New York. (Alex whistles) (Alex whistles) This is the gun. Nice. He asked me to marry him. Nice. - I don't want to do this anymore. - What?! - Maria... - I am pregnant. - You, a mother? Yeah. I don't want to take risks. Tell K. You can keep my share. Your share? He's rich, isn't he? You're a dick. I love him. Come on. Come here. I am happy for you. Thank you. Thank you. A family. I wonder what his eyes will look li... (shot) Why did you do this? Look what you made me do! # What's up? What's up in town? # # something... something's wrong! # # something's wrong! # Ohi, Abdu, how's it going? You sell anything? - Eh, almost 2 euros. - Ah, wow! Congrats. You did good! Keep it up and you can buy a house. In two centuries! - You're making fun of me. - I was just joking! - (Uncle Baldo) Professor, good morning. - Good morning! - Excuse me. So, what can I get you? - Yeah, I'd like coffee. - Same as usual. - Same as usual? Yeah, but not like the other time. What do you mean? I don't understand. - The box was almost empty the other time. - That's impossible. - I'm telling you, it was almost empty. - (woman) same for my cookies. (woman) the box looked sealed, and yet... - We checked all of them - Yeah. - I don't see any holes. - You see any holes in any of these fucking boxes - No, so what? This means the empty boxes came from your sister's basement. No. Paola's basement is safe. We can't mess this up. We'll be storing the dope there after the heist. I am telling you, it's safe! So who made those fucking holes in the fucking boxes? Stuart Little? Bye, sis. I'm off. - Here you are. - Sorry Uncle, I know I'm late. - You have no idea what happened... - Come here... - How's school? - It's great, I have an English test today. Did you study? Yes, uncle.

Good luck. Did you study? - Rock'n' roll! I did better than that. I saw him walk into the library, he was alone. I followed him! "Prof, what questions will be on the test?" Did he tell you?

I have an important meeting. It's for work. Yes, love you. Vincenzino says hi. - Says hi my ass... - Bye, mom. Don't call, okay? You should turn on vibration. (sicilian) I'll do that, stick my phone up your ass and then call you. (sicilian) How do you like it? - (Cop) This is the last one, detective. - Five crates. - 200 kilos sharp. - 200 kilos of what, detective? (detective) Extremely pure cocaine. We need to haul it to the incinerator. I'll go get the paperwork ready for the transport. (Vincenzo) Fuck! Where are the eyes supposed to go? (Andrea) Hurry up, you idiot!

You told me so much about your famed blowjobs! - Ssh! - You want another tutorial, eh? - Yes! - (Anna) See the princess over there? - Yeah. I bet she gives the daintiest blowjobs. Chiara, guys needs to feel your lips over... (Chiara) They need to feel them. And please don't give "yes, sir" blowjobs. Like this... - ...no! - Those aren't good. You need to lick it. A bit on the left, a bit on the right, on top... (Anna) you also need to run your tongue over it, and then... (Teenage girl) Gross! (laughter) (vocalist) This music is the shit!

She's hot. - Those are Nico's pictures. - Who's behind that mask? I don't know! Are those your boobs? Wow! - No, Vale! - Yes, and that's just the beginning! The tests came back negative. He's out of the woods. Two centimetres on the right and he'd be dead. - (sicilian) What did you tell the doctor? - I told him I was a relative. - And he gave you all of the info over the phone? - Sure. He said "Don't worry, detective Castri won't die." - They're discharging him tomorrow. - C'mon. - Yeah. Let's bring the boxes to the basement. -Come on, walk! - He's got a hard skull, you hit him hard. (Andrea and Vincenzo laugh) Stop dicking around. Hurry up. (Kelly sighs). - (Baldo) Good evening. - Good evening.. - Excuse me... - Sure. - You moving? - Mm... yes. - (Vincenzo) Ah, a foreigner... - yeah. Ask her if she has brothers, sisters, friends... - Do you have brothers, sisters, friends...? - What the fuck are you doing? Go on! (Vincenzo) Excuse me... - (Baldo) There, last trip and we're done. - Baldo? - I apologise for what I did before. - Fine, you're forgiven. - What are you doing? - Celebrating... Oh, come on. Don't. - Fuck, come on, we've got 200 kg of cocaine in these boxes. - Relax! Fine, but be quick. We need to leave. - Jesus, what a bitch... - Yeah... - Oh, Mara is here! - "Deep Throat" Mara. - Is that her nickname? - She gave 9 blowjobs in 30 minutes! - That's theis club's record! - 700.000 contacts on Youporn: she's a celebrity. - Please, I can do better that that.

My dear friend... let me introduce you to my other dear friend! We're close, we're close! Three, two, one... Good work! - What are you going to do with the money? - None of your business. - What are you going to do? - Come on, spit it! - I said no! Ok! Ok, fine. Do you remember Pilar? - Pilar? - Yeah. Who the fuck's Pilar? Dickhead. She worked in the store before you arrived. I met her in Cuba. It was love at first sight. I brought her here... it was the best year of my life. But then Filipe got sick. - Who the fuck's Filipe? - The dog. He's not a dog. Filipe is six years old. Sometimes, when he breathes, he goes blue. Is he a Smurf? He's my son! Every time he breathes... he gets very painful muscle spasms. Do you know how many times you breathe in a day? It's heartbreaking to watch. Children shouldn't get sick! Ever! Hey, kids, what's going on here? Get in line, chief. Don't bite. You're the last in the queue. - What queue? - What's going on? - We're playing a game! -A game?! - Yes. - Next! - What game? Fuck, girls... - Wanna come to my place? - No... let's go to mine. - What about your mom? - She's staying at her new boyfriend's. # ? bello immaginarsi trascinati dal tempo... # #... e se intanto invecchio, io voglio farlo con te. # #se mi vuoi bene, non c'? niente di male se piangi per amore. # # cosa devo fare? # # comunque ? bello cercarti fra la gente... # #... io che senza di te non riesco a ridere. # # buongiorno a te... # 'Like the sea...

Of course. And... If I asked you... ...how do you feel about me? I mean... # buongiorno a te, che sei uguale a me. # # eh!

You wretched.. - Come here. Come here! - No, stop! This is what you get for disrespecting me! Now clean up this mess. Hello? What? When?! - Mom, what happened? - He is dead... He's dead... - Uncle Baldo is dead. - What are you talking about? Police Station Sorry, I need some painkillers. My head's about to explode. Don't worry. So you have no other leads? Doctor, what would you have done in my shoes? Would you have shot them? That's enough. - I wouldn't call the press. Do you agree? - Of course, Chief. - Goodbye then. - detective... # voglio trovare un senso a questa sera... # #... anche se questa sera un senso non ce l'ha. # # voglio trovare un senso a questa vita... # #... anche se questa vita un senso non ce l'ha. # You know what's the last thing I told him?

That's 10 millon. Who knew we were transporting the cocaine yesterday? Fucking hell! It was just... ...just me and you. And the judge knows that. Fucking... fuck. Do you think the doctor suspects us? Not you. You almost died, so you're in the clear. As for me... You made it! Thanks! A cake for my favorite janitor. It looks great! Damn, Tony will love this. What? It's missing something? Powdered sugar. Hello, you've reached Andrea Giarratana's voicemail. If you want, leave a message, or fuck off. Answer the fucking phone. Hello, you've reached Andrea Giarratana's voicemail. If you want, leave a message... Answer the fucking phone! Hello, you've reached Andre... What? Fuck! Hey, Alex. Did everything go smoothly? - Yes. - Perfect. - Antonello Frigione! - Fuck off! # Tanti auguri a te! Tanti auguri a te! # Who told you? How did you know? - Oh god, you ask me the same question every year. Blow. - You know what? - No, come on... what are you doing? - I'll try it out. - I thought this'd be sweeter. - It's super sweet! - The taste is off... It's like... - Come on, blow these. Else it's bad luck. I'm not an idiot, you know? Thanks, Chiara! Thank you! Purest I've ever had! - Good morning, detective. - Mhm. - Good morning, detective. Everything alright? - Yes. Castri! - How's it going? - What brings you here? I've been sent here to investigate on the heist. What about you? I thought you were supposed to be on sick leave for 3 weeks. The perpetrators knew the exact date and time the transport would take place. They had the key to the court's garage. And, talk about luck... ...cameras were turned off for 8 minutes. Just enough to get in, steal the coke, and leave. That's strange. A cop must've organised this. I'll find out who it was. - How come you're not asking me to help? - No, no... you? You're in bad shape. You need to rest. I know what I need. Is that clear? Alright. You want some? I have another one. - No, thanks... - As you wish. Shit! Shit! Shit! High-grade cocaine!! There's so much of it in here! So that's what Uncle Baldo got up to... Fuck! It'll take ages to snort it all. What?! We won't be keeping that all to ourselves. We're keeping a good chunk for ourselves and we're selling the rest! - As if you could buy something better than this! - You can, actually! Won't be easy to sell all of our coke, eh? Our? My coke. Alright. Bye. - Shit, you're such a bitch. - No, come on, Tony, no, no. You're right, I'm a bitch. Partners? -Partners. - But we're not splitting 50-50. - Fuck off! Put it away! Put it away! Ok. Porno... ...mask. - Vale, what do I look like with this mask? - Cute but slutty. Come here, let's take a selfie. One sec... - Hot! - What are you laughing at! A site for wankers. Vale, this was a great idea. Match made in heaven. A slut and an IT genius. Vale! If Chiara finds out I'll murder you. Oh... if Chiara finds out... I'll cut your balls off. Girls, this is just a job. A business. We're in this for the money, okay? - Okay, but 200 euros isn't much. - This is just the beginning. - If people like it, you'll get to 800, even 1000. - 1000?! That's something. Here's the report from the highway patrol. Three of them. Died instantly. Andrea Giarratana, his brother Vincenzo, and some Gabrielli Baldo. Baldo? Who's that? Some guy who owned a deli. Here's the website. This took a while but I'm happy with the result. Pornomask. Net? That's so cool! This is the number of online users. It's 0 for now, but it will grow in time. - Are they paying? - Yeah, with credit cards. - Shall we start? - Mm-mm! #A meno che non stia davvero pensando solo a te ogni respiro... # #... ogni momento che vivo. # - Chiara. What's up? Why are you in such a hurry? - Well... - Do you know a few people who snort? - I know few people who DON'T snort. - Tony asked me to help him sell some... - Some snow? #... ma te ti sento dentro come un pugno. # # quando ti vedo ballare, vorrei morire. # # fammi vedere. # # fammi godere. # # vorrei stringerti le braccia... # #... le braccia intorno al collo e baciarti, baciarti dappertutto. # - Fuck, it's beautiful! - Show me. - It's gorgeous. - Isa, what are you doing? Isa, no. - I wouldn't wait for Nico to buy it for you... - Why, what do you have to say about him? - Nothing... - ...just that he is as romantic as someone who's shitting. - You don't know him. #... quante espressioni di godimento sul tuo volto... # #... si vedono solo con lo scorrimento lento. # #si vedono solo con lo scorrimento lento. # - Hi. - Hi. Tell me. - Can you show me the red shirt? - Sure. No, I don't like it. The one with the popcorn is cool! - How much? - 85. - Eh?! 85? That's basically armed robbery. # Mi aiuto con le illusioni e vivo di emozioni che tu... # #... tu non sai nemmeno di darmi. # Alfredo Schiassi? detective Castri. What do you want from me?

Bring him in. Come on. Everyone does coke. "Attention, please. Look at me". Kids, this time... ...it's coke. Fuck... - Is it good? - Did I ever sell you anything that wasn't good? This is coke. Extremely high grade coke. Ok, Tony, we're interested. 30 per gram, and these are a freebie. Yeah, sure, why not. What else do you want? A slice of my own ass? 60 euros per gram. I set the price. - No, Tony, I don't think so. - Hello Tony! - Come on, guys, stop joking. - We're not joking. Big Nose. See ya! Esmeralda, I'll get it. - Prof! - Shakespeare?! Ok. You... you... - you... - Prof, what do you want? Ascoltami. Ehm... "down... my house... water"! Who... telephone? In my house, water. Phone... home. Phone... home. Ah, I get it! Phone... home... Phone... home... - What?! - Prof, E.T. - No! It's... come with me! - Fuck, the bathroom is flooded. - Flooded, yes! Phone... who? Don't worry. Mr Wolf can help. - This is a tough one for Mr Wolf too. - No, it only takes two fingers.. - Ah, that's it! - Yes! Fuck. I called you... - I had a technical issue. - Already solved, I assume - Yes. - Good. See you at the factory in two days. "I want to write a book... but..." - "but I don't inspire." - Fuck, has she got asthma? No, no, she means she's missing the inspiration. - Inspiration, yes, yes! - Why are you using this? This is an old typewriter. - You'd be faster with a computer. - No, no... The world is too fast. People are just crazy. I only use the computer for shit. "Today... everything... fake." "Machine made by machine... before... no" "People made... with love." "...thing with soul..." "...and art." - Tony, what is she talking about? - She does drugs too. - ah... "he waz born... sheksper waz very important vriter." Tony, come on. Who'd have thought... I can give you the inspiration for your book! - Can I tell you about one of my "gangster" evenings? - Gangster evening? - Maybe I should shut up. I wouldn't want you to judge me. - No, no. - I only judge in school. - I'll tell you one of my hot stories. - Sure. - What are you talking about? - Wow! Yes, yes! Ok, ok, wait. Be right back. - Don't tell her about the coke! - Do you think I'm an idiot? - By the way, did you manage to sell some? - I've started to circulate it. - I gave away some, huh, free samples. - What?! - Samples? - Yeah, just to get started! - Classic bait and switch. - (kelly) Can I make a movie? - A video? Sure. - No, not while I'm smoking this... - No, no, come on. - Tony, behave. - George clooney! - No! Drop it. - Take your glasses off, please. - I said no... - Don't film me. - Scoot! Ok, I'll tell you another gangster story. It was me, Ste and Anna. We were at Ste's house. There was a guy with us. Carmelo. We were smoking a "paglino". - Of course. - "Paglino"? - It's a cigarette with coke. - Coke? - Ssh! - Tony 's an expert. - Tony, smile. - Stop! Ste was drinking. She started screaming: "You'll never meet 3 hot girls like us in your lifetime! You should kiss my ass for this!" Chiara! She's filming everything. What if this video gets out? Tony, relax. I'm not doing anything wrong. D'you know what she did next? She got his dick out of his pants! - I have to say. It was quite thick. - Jesus. - Like a baby bottle: it was fantastic! - Oh, great. - So I fucked him. - Oh, come on... Can I tell you about another one of my gangster evenings? So, that evening I felt like smoking... guess where! In the bathtub. - Good morning, chief. - Morning. Can I do anything for you? Look at this. - Maria?! - Yeah. That's your deputy inspector Maria Berti. She was found two hours ago, in a ditch near the highway. The first round of tests came back. She died between Friday and Saturday. - How did she die? - Killed with a stolen gun. Who's gonna tell Castri? Castri? Were they together? No, they were like siblings. They had a lot of cases together. - Ah, so they were partners. - Yeah... for years. For years... What?! That's impossible. - 400 boxes, half a kilo each? - 200 kgs! Yep. Exactly! - Ah! - High five! - Baldo... Where did he get it? - Dunno! - What do we care? It's so much stuff! So much stuff! SO!! MUCH!!! You're not joking, are you? You tell me if I'm joking. Wait, wait. Hear me out. We need to organize a rave party. You know, like a last minute party. So the police won't bother us. Indoors, though. And we won't tell anyone we organised it. We'll pretend we heard about this too. Perfect. You're a genius. We need ground rules. Number one: no one must know that the coke is ours. Number two: no one must know that it's ours. - Number three... - Three. We're only telling friends. Trustworthy people. So. All of your friends, and all of my friends, they all do coke. Where on earth are we going to find a place big enough? Guys! I know where. (Tv) Everything alright? - Mom! Here's your chamomile. - Thank you, darling. (Tv) I'm about to come in. It's good. (Tv) What are you doing? Oh... The girls... get the girls! Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom?! Hey, Tony. Your sleeping pill worked like a charm. I thought I had killed her. I have the keys. I'm on my way. - Can I try some? - Here. - Try it! - Where else do you find dope like this? - It's amazing! - 70 euros for 2 bags. 40 if you want a third bag. - It's craz... - I want 5. - Go Tony, go! Guys, cocaine for everyone! - What's up? - What's up?! This evening you're fucking Cris, Jessica... ...and Faby too! Oh, wow... and surprise, Pigi as well. Oh god, I'm already wet- - What about you two? - We're the managers. - You're scared of getting caught. - Me?! - Stop fucking around and get to work? - I like you more like this. Slut! Who wants some cocaine? Let's go! Put your masks on! - I'm the devil! I'll get you. - Where are you going to stick your tail? - Come here. - Who wants to go first? - Look who's here! - Hi, Tony! - Hi kids. - 20 bags. Quick. - I've had enough! - Enough my ass. - If you share that video, I'll know it was you. - And? - And these guys will know too. - Tony, stop them! - I'll be famous, but you... you won't be able to walk. But I'll be nice. Since you're regulars... ...it's 40 for each bag. - Thanks, guys. - Alright, alright. We were just joking. We'll have... one bag. - Do you have the money? - You broke the piggy bank? - That's all we have. - Go, go. Skedaddle. - Thanks, Tony. We're still friends, right? When you're with me... I realise when you're not with me, I miss you. Really? Nico, what's up? You're distant. What are you talking about? You're so beautiful. Then let's get on the plane. Nico, what's the fucking matter? Are you fucking someone else? Someone else?! - Let me go! - Come here. - No... What are you talking about... # Lo so che ? strano... # # comunque ? bello cercarti fra la gente... # #... io che senza di te non riesco a ridere. # Hey. I'm gonna check how much we've made today. Shit, there's so many people online! - Wait, wait, wait... - Why? - Wait. - Let me take this off. - I'll undress too. - Pigi, look! - Mm... not bad. - Bibi, come here. - No! - Some manager he is! I thought Chiara wasn't supposed to know. They're not wearing masks! - No! - The bitch! - No! - Wait. - Fuck! - Wait, there's another camera. - I'll switch it on. - There he is! Go, Nico! Wow! - Come on! - No! No! That's it. # Buongiorno a te... # #... che sei uguale a me. # This is the gun Maria Berti was killed with. A single shot. This means she knew the killer. - She trusted him. She turned his back to him. - So what? Why do you think someone would kill a cop this way? I'll tell you. Because that cop was corrupt. That's why. Berti was part of the gang who stole the coke. If this is true, there's another element we should consider. Castri and Berti were partners. They had been for years and years. -They were like siblings. - Fine, calm down. You don't get this! If Berti was this close to a criminal... ...with a gang of criminals, this means Castri knew! Do you see this now? - I see. What now? - What now? I dunno, what do you think? I dunno, investigate? Let's have him followed. Tap his phone. Get his phone records to see who he was calling. - Do you have any proof? - Proof?! Give me a warrant and I'll find as much proof as you want in two days! - Guidotti, calm down! - I am calm! - I need proof. - Fine, I'll do whatever I want. Vaffanculo! # Mi piaci proprio come sei, e anche quella che vuoi sembrare. # # mi piaci perch? non ce la fai, e allora ti lasci andare. # # mi piaci quando fai l'amore... # You're worth much more than my 200kg of coke. I love you. # Mi piaci quando riapri gli occhi e dici di vedere il mare! # # mi piaci tu! Mi piaci tu! Mi piaci tu! # # ma come te lo devo dire? # # mi piaci tu! Mi piaci tu! Mi piaci solo tu! # # ma come te lo devo dire? # Thank you for coming here so fast. - You called? - Yes. Come with me. Look at this mess. They destroyed everything. What did they want? You tell me. No sign of a break-in? No. I don't know how they got in. Who's got the keys? Of course I have the keys. I'm holding them right now. Yeah, I have them. Fine, fine, I'm coming. See you. - Everything alright, mom? - No, there was a disaster at the aeroclub. Disaster? Yeah, a disaster. - The police is there. - The police? - And the funeral's tomorrow. - It's at 16:00, right? - Yeah. See you later. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Fucking lighter! Wait.. Detective! What's going on? Detective, look. It's everywhere. Someone did a lot of coke here tonight. - Who's these two? - Two idiots, they were sleeping in a plane. Leave us alone. - Do you have a lighter? - Yes. I'm inclined to hold you responsible for all of this. Drug dealing... ...burglary... ...damage to property... 3 to 4 year in prison. - Who brought the coke? - Coke? I dunno. There was a stand... - Don't bullshit me. - No, he's telling the truth. Who brought the coke? I don't know who brought the coke! I'm just a friend of Nico's. - Nico? - Nico, the DJ... he works at Magic. Hi, Nico. - Who the fuck are you? - How are you? - Let me go, asshole! - I am going to ask you a few questions! So make sure you answer wisely. - Where's my cocaine? - Cocaine? What are you going on about? That wasn't wise. Sleep well? So, my dear friend, I'm going to ask again. Be careful. It's an easy question, you can't get it wrong. Where is my cocaine? Vaffanculo! Wrong again. Interesting. Shall we try again? We shall. Of course we shall. Where is my cocaine? Vaffanculo, piece of shit! Wrong again. Latest model. It's so slim, so modern. Crazy what you kids can do with these phones. Look at this. You're worth more than my 200kg of coke. I love you. Bet she gives great blowjobs. You're worthless now. Bye bye. - Chiara, get me out of here! - Esmeralda, calm down! - The red clouds are here. - Your pills are on the table. - It's not safe here, Chiara! - Good. Be quiet now. I'll give you a massage. Esmeralda? Why is the door open? Esmeralda? Who are you? - You're much prettier in person than in the video. - What?! I'm Nico's friends. - He shows me so many good videos. - What videos? All of them. I swear, it's all here. I didn't take much. I swear I had nothing to do with this, it was my uncle. I swear I had nothing to do with this, I found it here. I swear I found it here. I swear I had nothing to do with this, it was my uncle. I had nothing to do with this, I only took a bit. I swear I only took a bit, you can have it. I swear I had nothing to do with this, I swear. I swear I had nothing to do with this, I found it. I swear I had nothing to do with this, I swear. I swear I had nothing to do with this, I swear. - Shut up! It's all here. It's all here. It's all here. It's all... It's all here. It's all yours. It's all yours. - Teenagers! - It's all yours! - Teenagers! - It's all here. - It's all yours. - It's all here. I can go now, right? Dawson's Creek's over, you bitch! Can I tell you about another gangster evening? No, those are just a game... Just for fun. I'd never cheat on Nico. When I'm with him, I feel something inside... We have something special. I only feel like myself when I'm with him. It feels like we're breathing together... ...like we're going towards the same destination... hand in hand. Like we're looking for the rainbow. I love him. # Respiri piano per non far rumore... # #... ti addormenti di sera e ti risvegli col sole... # #... sei chiara come un'alba... # #... sei fresca come l'aria. # # diventi rossa se qualcuno ti guarda... # #... e sei fantastica quando sei assorta... # #... nei tuoi problemi, nei tuoi pensieri. # # ti vesti svogliatamente... # #... non metti mai niente che possa attirare attenzione... # #... in particolare... # #... solo per farti guardare! # # respiri piano per non far rumore... # #... ti addormenti di sera e ti risvegli col sole... # #... sei chiara come un'alba... # #... sei fresca come l'aria. # # diventi rossa se qualcuno ti guarda... # #... e sei fantastica quando sei assorta... # #... nei tuoi problemi, nei tuoi pensieri... # # ti vesti svogliatamente... # #... non metti mai niente che possa attirare attenzione... # #... in particolare... # #... per farti guardare! # # e con la faccia pulita cammini per strada... # #... mangiando una mela coi libri di scuola... # #... ti piace studiare, non te ne devi vergognare! # # e quando guardi con quegli occhi grandi... #... forse un po' troppo sinceri, sinceri... # #... si vede quello che pensi, quello che sogni! # # e qualche volta fai pensieri strani... # (k) Welcome, Alex. We've hit a snag, but I fixed it. We have all of it. There's just 2kg missing. You can take that from my share, of course. No. We'll share the loss, like partners.
