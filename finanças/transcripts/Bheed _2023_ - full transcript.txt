Thirteen days after the first lockdown, when rumor was spreading faster than Corona, when more migrant workers braved the road than all the masks or sanitizers we could produce, this is a story of that time. Be careful, child. Child! Oh, God. I said we should walk on the main road. But we're walking on the tracks. The police are beating people up on the main road. They say we're spreading Corona. Are we responsible for it everywhere? There's no way of getting home. No buses, no trains. It's becoming so difficult. There's no work. - It's worrying. - That's true. Everyone is very tired. - Let the kids eat. - What if a train comes? The trains and buses have all stopped. No train is coming. - It's very difficult to get anywhere. - Here, eat. Uncle, eat something. No, I'm okay. The Aurangabad train ran over a group of migrants, killing them. They were walking on the tracks and got run over by a freight train… Move back! Where is the driver?! Get in! This bus will take us! There are no buses arranged. That was a fake WassApp. People are fleeing in trucks and tempos. If you hadn't drunk this morning, I could've got you onto a truck. Balram Trivedi, sir. I'm Balram Trivedi, sir. I'm the watchman at your building. I wash your Mercedes, sir. Sir, we are 13 watchmen traveling with our families. There are no arrangements here, sir. Since your son-in-law is in the transport business, we'll all chip in to pay our way, but can you get us a discount, so we can return to our villages? Move back! Move back! Sir, please! I am requesting you! Dubey! Dubey, get to the back. Take them back to the bus. - Sir, please! - Go back! - Go back! - Why are you hitting people? - We're going. - Go! - Go back! - Listen… Listen, Devesh! You agreed to send Navya to that hostel. Okay? Forget about helping me, but you could've left Goa to pick up your daughter. Instead, you got the chance to sneakily file a custody petition. I can take care of my daughter! What kind of a useless man are you?! Asshole! Raghu, you see that truck? Follow it! I want to record a link. Okay? Just follow that truck. - Ready? - Ready. Vidhi Prabhakar, reporting live from Varsha Vihar. Amidst this sea of homebound migrants, my eyes fell on this truck. In some ways, we're like this truck. Bound together by a piece of jute that we call our "society." If you look closely, this large jute bundle is made up of many pieces sewn together. Every time this truck drives over bumpy ground, I worry the jute might split at the seams, and from a society held together, we'll become a divided crowd. Step back. - Yadav-ji… - First, stand up and then speak. Go and check. Yadav-ji, the village taps have run dry for three days. Sudama had a fever, so he used the temple hand pump - and filled his bucket. - Stop that trolley! - We need that trolley for a hospital trip. - The village chief's brother beat Sudama to a pulp. Nirmala! Let her pass. When did it happen? - Step back! - Nine in the morning. Who were they? The village chief's brother. - I meant his name. - Dinesh! - Just a minute. Dinesh? - Yes. Jai Hind, sir. - Careful. - Yes, sir. - Hold him. - Okay, sir. Okay. We'll take care of it. Don't worry. - Okay, sir. - Nirmala, don't take him to the Health Center. He has a fever. So they'll test him for Corona first. Don't worry. Yadav-ji will file a police report. Do you know Nirmala? She's my cousin. I come here for the Rakhi and Teej festivals. When did you change your name to Surya Kumar Singh? I didn't. My father did. When he admitted me to school. And your father's name? Gautam Lal Tikas. You're a Tikas? I thought you were a Somas. No, sir. Tikas. Yes, sir? The checkpoint has been set up. No one can pass. Jai Hind, sir. All trains and buses have been suspended. The migrants have no way of returning to their villages. How will they manage? The government will do something. The government will find a way out. We've been ordered to shut all the ways out. All the State borders are being sealed. And the checkpoint at Tejpur Highway? There's already a crowd of 400-500 there. Everyone wants to return home. There's a seven-day quarantine here. If anyone tests positive, there's a separate ward for them over there. - How many can it accommodate? - About 14 to 15. - What about shitting? - What? Those people have to relieve themselves, right? There's the school toilet. But that's for the children. You could start a fertilizer factory with the shit of 15 men. About 150,000 people are on the roads. If you can't watch TV, then at least check your WassApp. Even though I'm aware they are both fooling us. Hey. Send the money. He's after my life. Interesting how people open shops before they set up homes. That's the road I told you about. It connects to the highway. Migrants could enter the State from here. Uncle, Naresh's fever is not going down. It's still 104. Trivedi, wear a mask. It's not Corona. He hasn't been abroad. If newspapers and lift buttons can spread it, then what does that tell you? What if one of the tenants traveled overseas? So? Should I abandon my brother? Put on your mask. Naresh… He's not breathing properly. Trust me. We must stop and find a doctor. It's me, Balram. Your brother. Baby, does it matter if I left first or your father did? The important thing is to get you safely from the hostel. Navya, there are thousands and thousands of people on the road. I don't know why they're risking their lives like this. I guess they have high immunity. I doubt they suffer from lactose intolerance and migraines. We city folk are so delicate. I've never heard my driver Kanhaiyya say, "Ma'am, I have a headache." We're used to it, ma'am. See? His immunity is very high. They should maintain social distancing… Amma was lucky that she died. She left me behind to do odd jobs to pay for your alcohol. Papa, are you okay? Keep drinking and keep throwing up. You never eat or drink any water. You'll die puking one day. And you'll leave me to die alone. Tejpur and its nearby borders are being sealed. Have they any idea how many are coming? Damn! I love the Indian countryside. Which window? Yours or mine? Any. You choose what you want to see. This is such an unprecedented mass migration. One day these people were told the homes where they lived… no longer belonged to them. You, here? You're unbelievable. You should've told me you were coming. You show up out of the blue. With bags and all. - Did anyone see you come in? - No. So what if they had? I was looking beautiful three hours ago. I need some tea made with love. Then I'll look pretty again. Well? Do I get a cup? Renu Sharma-ji has blessed me with her presence. Of course. - Sugar? Or are you still avoiding it? - Salt will do. You keep the place tidy. - I had a hunch you'd be coming. - Really? "Had a hunch," like hell! Pass me some ginger. - What are you doing? - Just checking if you're tired. - That's how you check? - How else? You can check me too. See if I'm tired. Come on! You're in quite a mood! I can tell you're not tired without checking. Is that so? You're looking very beautiful. Final-year students were sent to work at the Health Center here. I wangled a way here. Three days. Training. That's why I was checking… if you were tired. I don't know. I think I should consult a sex doctor. Nonsense! You don't need a doctor. That brain of yours… could use some rest. When you're not overthinking, by God! You blow my mind. Come. Mom packed some food. I made a special potato curry. Get up. You know… A checkpoint might be set up opposite the mall. I suggested it to the CO sir. He asked, "Should I make you the officer-in-charge?" Let's see. He'll call me tonight. What's he wearing? It's just a cough. Uncle, you need to wear all this when treating a Corona patient. Naresh doesn't have Corona. He has a cough and a fever. He catches a cough all the time. Give him medicine and go home. What's with all these costumes? - They're just scaring us. - Can you shut up for once?! I begged them to open this clinic. There's no hospital in Tejpur. And now there's a checkpoint there. Meaning? We can't enter the State. We can't enter our own State? Our Minister is giving a speech this morning. Who knows, he might reopen the border. Border? Dubey… Borders within our own country? See? When you're not overthinking, you're quite something. Sure, everything is my mind's fault. Is it my fault then? It's because I'm not in your league. Meaning? When we used to cycle through your village, my father would get down and hold his slippers in his hands. And I'd walk barefoot behind him. That's how I grew up, Sharma-ji. These caste divisions… "You can't enter here. Don't touch this or that." All this… My hands still tremble when I touch you. Is it my father's fault? Tell me. If I told your father that I loved you, what would happen? You tell me. Justice is always in the hands of the powerful. If the powerless delivered justice… justice would be different. Move! You always have sex on your mind! It must be Yadav-ji. Where's the phone? Shit! Got it. It's Yadav-ji. Jai Hind, sir. Yes, sir. Jai Hind, sir. Renu Sharma-ji, Surya Kumar Singh, son of Gautam Lal Tikas, has been appointed the temporary station-in-charge by the CO. What will you do all day in the village? I'll sleep under Lallan's mango tree while you play on the swing with the kids. "Play on the swing." - Come, get in. - Everything outside… There's a truck driver who might agree to take us. Sit here. I'll ask. Don't move. Yes. I can't pay from my pocket. I have a house to run. You're correct. I was told there's a truck taking people home. Yes, child. See the truck parked over there? Talk to Gopal. Tell him Mahinder sent you. I'll take you. - It's not possible. - Take me along. - Start the vehicle. - Let's go. - Start the vehicle. - Careful. Brother Gopal! Mahinder sent me. There are only two of us. - Where do you want to go? - Anywhere after Jhajhar. - It will cost you 3500 rupees. - Okay, wait. I'll be right back. - Okay. Hurry up! - Just two minutes. Take me too, brother. But I am 500 rupees short. So? Should I charge them 500 less? Papa? Papa? Yes, let's go! Sit inside. Let's go, Papa. Give me the cash. Where's the money? I gave it to you, Papa. Hurry. I need to pay him. He'll take the cycle as well. Where the hell is the money?! What kind of father are you?! Dear Moon - Come here, come down - Do you even think about me?! Ever?! Come down by the riverbank Couldn't you wait till we got home? - Dear Moon - I don't want to be a maid all my life. Come amidst the courtyard - I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving. - Let my young Krishna play Young Krishna slipped out of my lap He kept looking for the moon in the river He said to me Mother, the waves have taken the moon away How can I play now? Listen, I have to work late. - You'll be back late too, right? - Maybe. Stop fussing. You look like a real hero. Let's run away. Why? Have we robbed anyone? And where can we run to? If we don't, my father will marry me off to someone else. Then you'll regret it. Won't you do anything about it? What can I do? Who decided we can't love each other? Did I? So all the responsibility of fighting is mine? While you and your father sit and watch. Right? Or you just marry whoever your father chooses for you. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind! - Hurry up. - Listen… Jai Hind, sir. Where's my tea? DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ENTRY OF OUTSIDERS IS PROHIBITED IN PARWANA VILLAGE. BY ORDER: DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION Jai Hind, sir. How many more drums do we have? - Mr.Surya, first have some tea, - Cover this area… work comes later. Come here. Come here, there's room. - Sir! - Don't embarrass me, Ram Singh-ji. Have some tea. The men are working. - Pour another. - I've just had one. You go ahead. I kept waiting while Yadav-ji made you the in-charge. It's okay. Everyone looks after their own community. He knows you are with me, Mr. Singh. You're the real Singh now. Shit! Navya… They've set up a checkpoint here too. Kanhaiyya, hurry! They might let us through. Here we go. That can't be the only car coming this way. Sir. Sir, my daughter's hostel is nearby. We'll come straight back with her. Please. We have no orders. It'll only take us two hours. It's really not far. We'll be very quick. Please, sir. We can come to an agreement… Wait a minute. - What do you think? - He'll be back. It's a lady in a posh car. She's ready with 5000 rupees. Bloody hell! It's like the circus has come to town. Don't worry, Mr. Surya. I was at the Tejpur checkpoint yesterday. They'll whine for a few hours, and then they'll settle down. Barricade that area too. Sure. Don't worry. What about the mall? They have their own security. The one sitting there? Yes, him. I'll go check. You deal with the mall. I'll handle the situation here. Hey, Pramod! Pull a few barricades on this side. Yes, sir. - Sir. - Good you thought of it. I would've been humiliated otherwise. Good work, Surya. Listen. Some constables were released from ministerial duty. I'll see how many men I can send you. Okay? Yes, sir. You'll manage it, right? Of course, sir. Why not? Okay. I'll call you. Yes, Father? My respects. That shutter is open. Keep guard over there. Go! Does Mom have a fever? Then check it. How long have you had a fever? Papa, spring always sets off your allergies. Not every fever is Corona. Uncle, did you see Fakebook? What is it? The Minister has given clear instructions that homebound migrants must not be troubled. Official meetings are in progress. Yes, I read that too. Kamble, step on it! Uncle, the fever isn't going down. - Chaubey, get the megaphone. - Yes. We need to announce… Are the barricades in place? The barricades? Didn't I ask you to move them? - Chaubey, wait. Let me finish. - Sir. Sorry, sir. Make an announcement - urging people to remain calm. - Okay, sir. - Ramadeen, you stay put. - Yes, sir. Explain to people they're not allowed to pass. - Yes, sir. - Go. No one enters. Stop here. Mr. Singh. Namaskar. I'm Pushpesh Singh. The younger brother of Bhanpur's ex-Minister, Somesh Singh. I'm sending them to the barricade. - Go ahead. - Okay. Somesh Singh is an important Thakur leader. Let our cars pass. If anyone asks, say we have a special pass. No such orders. Listen to me… You're the only lady constable, so stay here. - Maintain law and order! - Listen to me! Ram Singh-ji. - Do not cause panic. - Ask everyone to sit over there. Maintain law and order. Do not cause panic. - Listen, Santosh. - Yes, sir. Cover the window near Naresh with some cloth. If anyone asks, say it's the night driver who is sleeping. Send any of the kids who want to pee. - Okay. - Send them. We're coming. Maintain law and order. Follow social distancing. Do not cause panic. Stay where you are. Listen, we… Listen… We've been ordered to seal the State borders. Until we hear any different, we can't allow anyone through. It's going to take time. Three or four hours. Maybe more. Till then, just sit in the fields. Okay? And if anyone tries to sneak across the border, they will face criminal charges. Is that clear? Mind my words carefully! We'll keep you posted. Sit down for now. Maintain six feet distance. Follow social distancing. Bullshit! Listen, sir. Did you hear the outcome of the local authorities meeting? They're discussing about you guys. We'll keep you informed. Maintain law and order. Do not cause panic. Maintain social distancing. Do not cause panic. Stay where you are. Maintain social distancing. Please continue to cover your face. Do not cause panic. Maintain social distancing. Please continue to cover your face. Maintain social distancing. If it wasn't for that damn doctor, we wouldn't be stuck here. We've run out of food now. The kids will be hungry soon. Send someone to get some food. - Send Biseswar. - We'll figure something out. Biseswar! Come out. Hello. I forgot to wish you luck, so… It's okay. You're all the luck I need. I hear there's a big crowd there. Yes. You know what happened… Some minister's relative was requesting me to let him pass. I'm not accustomed to someone higher-up asking me for a favor. So I just froze. Sometimes I feel my job means just to follow orders. Take care. TRAFFIC POLICE This is good. I've sealed off that end. All good now. Stop them! Nasir. Solid information. As always. This is much better than the highway spot. Vidhi. Wait till you see… the images I'm going to get you now. Like what? See those graves in that field? Hindu farmers are buried there. They choose to stay close to their land, even in death. Alive, they were forced to leave their land to earn a living. Some people wouldn't understand. But who gives a damn anyway? In this small village in the Tejpur District, near the functional mall of an upcoming smart city, this checkpoint has been set up. This is the only road from the village to the Tejpur highway… that could've taken the migrants home. But when many people finally got here, they discovered all the roads home were sealed off. Stay tuned for more stories. With cameramen Nasir Munir and Raghu Joshi, I, Vidhi Prabhakar, will be the first to bring you these untold stories. - The clay king is thirsty - I come from Khalsapur village. And so is the queen I've been walking for four days. I finally got an auto, but the cops stopped us. My clay horse will not stir For want of water How can we ride on? Parched are the flowers we planted How can we walk on the bamboo roof When there is no sign of rain? To whom can we express our suffering? Once again, you all were not mentioned in today's speech. Although not mentioned in his speech, the authorities have been directed to make arrangements for us. - Who said that? - It's all over WassApp. My son phoned me. - Go! - Guddu, come here! There are so many here. It takes time to arrange food. That's your problem. They've been standing here for hours. - We're standing too! - The Minister is right. Getting food takes time. Think we're running a restaurant here? - How dare you swear at us! - Who swore at you? - You did! - No way. The officials told you cops to look after us migrants. And you're openly swearing at us. - No one swore at you. He did. - Yes, you did! He's swearing and talking back at me. - He's swearing at us! - Yes, you did! He's talking back to me! - He's swearing at us! - I didn't swear! - Hey, don't talk back to me! - Okay. - He's swearing at us. - I did not! What's going on? He's abusing our minister! Do you call this social distancing? Step back. Where are your masks? Wear it! It's no joke. - What happened? - He swore at us. - I didn't. - He did. Even if he did, I apologize. Okay? We know how worried you are. But we're just following orders. Move back! Ram Singh-ji, let's go. Go and keep a safe distance. Put on your mask. He didn't swear at us, but I backed you. We must present a united front. Come here. A little to the left. Ready? - Madam? - Yes? - One second. Can I have a word? - Tell me. Two minutes, Nasir. Yes? My man was in the wrong. He shouldn't have sworn at them. But who could've anticipated such a crowd at this checkpoint? There's pressure from above too. I'm sure you understand me. Don't report this "swearing" incident. I request you. All right. I won't. But will you do something in exchange? Like what? - We'll see. - Listen… Don't crowd at the barricade. Stay where you are. - We will keep you posted. - Excuse me, sir. Sir, my name is Anand. Our bus has seven to eight individuals with a high fever and a bad cough. - The passengers are panicking. - Move back. - Which bus? - At the back. The blue one. Thank you, sir. What was that about? Nothing. He was requesting me not to report the brawl. Transactional journalism! Vidhi Prabhakar is bending the rules. And I used to be jealous, thinking your kind of journalism was more ethical than mine. So? Drinking tea when we're short of men? Sipping tea in this chaos? - I haven't had tea since the morning. - Ram Singh-ji… - Why did you swear at them? - As if! - Don't lie. - I didn't swear. That minister is lying. As if I don't know you well. "I didn't swear." Anyway, listen. See that blue bus? - Some passengers have a fever. - What? Be careful. We don't want to start a panic. Put on your mask and go… You have a mask? I had… - Your world has a different Corona? - A mask makes no difference. - Give him a mask. - I'll manage. Go, sanitize those passengers. - Line them up outside. - Okay. I'll call the Health Center. Have we got sanitizers? Do we? - Do we have it or not? - Yes. Lots, sir... Are you waiting to drink it? Bring it. - Yes, sir. - Go. Keep a cool head. Sir. I've asked the mixer to stop. He's crossing the line. He's lost. He thinks he's the real boss. Your shop's still open? It's a lockdown. - The last round of tea, sir. - Hurry. Okay, sir. - We're from the Quarantine Center, sir. - I was just about to call you. - Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind. Report to Chaubey-ji. Yes, sir. Come. Sir, the Center is already full. Many people from the Tejpur checkpoint were admitted. We'll have to make arrangements here. Here? Where? Sir, what about over there? What's that? I think it's the tent for the mall's Holi program. We can keep the symptomatic people there. It's quite big and spacious, and it's airy too. - Should I go check? - Go ahead. Okay. If anyone is very ill, we'll send them to the hospital. Did anyone complain of a fever? I've sent someone to check. A few passengers on the bus are unwell. I have sent someone to check… What's going on there? I told them only to sanitize… What's all this? We must sanitize them before they go to the hospital. - Turn off that machine! Off, I said! - Turn it off! - He's sick. He'll infect the others. - Who asked you to? No, he won't. He lying over there... Ram Singh-ji! What happened? There's a patient on their bus. They won't let me check him. Naresh is unwell. He'll be fine once we get home. The doctor will see if he needs to be sent to a hospital. Treating us like animals. Let us go home, Mr. Singh. He's my brother. I know what's wrong with him. We still have to get him checked out. Ram Singh-ji, help the man out. - Take him to the hospital. - I'll go too. - You can't. - What? - The patient needs his next of kin. - Not here. Move aside. - Why not? I'll come… - Don't argue. How dare you touch me?! Move aside. Balram Trivedi is my name. - Who touched you? - You touched Balram Trivedi. Don't make me mad. I know how to curse your horoscope. - What did you say? - Hey! Hey, lower your voice! Who are you to curse a cop's horoscope? We follow the law, not your horoscopes. Got it? How can we trust what happens to us after what we've seen here? Where are you sending him? - To the hospital. Where else? - Which hospital? He needs to be treated... One second… let me talk. Why are you getting so upset? Can you see that tent? That's where we're taking him. He's my brother. I understand. But I'm a doctor. We will not harm him. Let him have his check-up. Naresh, can you walk? Dubey, open the door. I'm trusting you. - Where's your mask? Cover your mouth. - Yes. Okay. - Where's your mask? - Bring him out. - Put it on. - Yes. What's going on here? Sit over there! We'll stay quiet for now. But don't try our patience, Mr. Singh. We've come a long way, and we're running out of patience. Go! Sit over there. Lord Krishna… Mr. Singh, wait. Hear me out. Brijesh-ji wants to talk to you. Mr. Singh! At this checkpoint, there are lots of Singhs. And Shuklas, and Trivedis. But the law is the same for everyone. Is that clear? After all these years, you still don't get it. I do not belong to their community. My name is Surya Kumar Singh… Tikas. Do you understand what a Tikas is? A Tikas. Maintain law and order. Maintain social distancing. I thought he was one of us. - Keep him close. Don't lose him. - See the crowd. - And wear your mask. - Hold my hand, or you could get lost. You know Corona is spreading. So why are you being so careless? You two, please sit down. - You don't wish to? Then go there. - Brother! Where are they taking those ladies? They've arranged some kind of bathroom for them. The kids are getting hungry. They'll start crying soon. We've fallen into a trap. We're just two hours away from home. And we're squatting on the roadside like beggars. We've sent Biseswar, right? He'll get something to eat. Hey, stop! Sir. Sir, listen. Can you order some more sanitary pads? We'll need them. Okay. Young girls are being forced to use newspapers as sanitary pads. Do you think anyone here has Corona? I can't say without testing them. Every day they talk of a new symptom. It's driving me crazy. But if one person has it, many could. Take care of yourself. I will. But you be careful too. Maintain a distance when you talk to people. You never wear your mask. - How many times must I tell you? - Yes… I will. By the way, that was quite impressive. Surya Kumar Singh… Tikas. My full name! Uncle, move aside! - Move. A patient is coming through. - He fell down. See you later. Move to the side. The deadly virus is spreading to other States... What's all this? Move. He's a patient. What's going on? …with 20 people in Nizamuddin. - The virus has reached Kashmir. - What's that? The Head is Srinagar's first Corona victim. Sir, a bus has arrived with only Muslim passengers. He returned to Srinagar on 16th March. He was diagnosed with the virus four days before he died. - Twelve people came in contact with him... - Turn it off. Where is the bus from? Delhi? Lucknow? Kolkata? Did you even ask? Or can you only see Muslims? Get going! Even Corona has a religion now. Sir. There's a cement mixer truck over there. He has to report at the site. He has a pass. He has repaired the mixer at Ghaziabad. He must be at the flyover now. - How many people? - Two. A driver and a cleaner. - It can pass from that side, right? - Yes. Let it through. Okay, sir. Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat is spreading the deadly virus in other States. - Because of Corona… - Till now, 1548 people have been removed from the Markaz. Doctor, he's my father. It's okay. - He fainted seven to eight hours ago. - Stay calm. …out of which, 441 we symptomatic. Where to? Let's try there. The kids are running about. Get them settled in one place. This pandemic - has engulfed the entire world. - Who's crying? - Stop crying. - When this Coronavirus… Under these circumstances, if we behave irresponsibly to organize superspreading events, where masses gather… That was a completely wrong move. This has raised the risk of extending the lockdown. We hear many people have gone home to different states… - Thinking about its impact is daunting. - The Jamaat spread the virus to various parts of the country from Delhi. But they cannot escape legal consequences anymore… So many people live nearby. Why can't the locals help these migrants with food and water? Everyone is scared of Corona, Vidhi. What's so funny, Raghu? Feels like, before Covid, people were super charitable, helping the poor! We are a sick society, Vidhi. We turn a blind eye to the men who clean our sewers. We don't see the children who sleep on pavements. As if we cared about feeding them. I hope they never go back to work in the cities. We never valued them. They are 100% certain to return. We've systematically made them into cheap labor. They'll have to go back. - You want food? Here. Take this. - What are you doing? - Take this! You want food? - Why are you hitting her? - Out! Come on out. - Why are you hitting her? What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Hitting a child? What can I do? She's been crying since this morning. She's starving. Other kids are hungry too. But they're sitting quietly. Am I supposed to pluck food from the sky? Okay. Go back inside. Be kind to her. Go. - Stop the truck! - Stop! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! Israr Bhai says you should sit inside the bus. Go ask around. - Go. I'll come. - Maybe you'll find something. Give it a try. - Is it Biseswar? - Yes. Has he gone to a faraway Delhi to get food? He's looking everywhere. There's no food to be found. We don't need a feast. A few hundred puris will do. Forget about puris, Trivedi, he can't even find a single fruit. While hundreds of homebound migrants remain stuck at this checkpoint, - a government vehicle - Keep moving. Is given a police escort. Development doesn't wait for anyone. With cameraman Nasir Munir, this is Vidhi Prabhakar, Live News. Keep going. Move back! - How come this mixer is allowed through? - Move back! - Were you bribed? - Stay back. How much did they pay? I'll pay you more. - They have a permit. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Go. - Be careful. - Slowly. - Be careful. - You better let Mr. Singh know about this. - Sir, allow us to go to a market nearby. - This will no longer be tolerated. The kids are very hungry. Move back. It's a lockdown, Mr. Trivedi. Everything is shut. It's all over Fakebook. There's a meeting about us migrants. Haven't you heard? Hey! Turn off the engine. What's inside? - Get him down! - Get down! - Open up. - Jagdish, get him out. Get down! - Open the hatch! Stay back. - Get down! Climb up. Climb. Open it. How many people are in there? - Get them out. - Come out. Come out. - What are you doing in there? - I want to go home, sir. - Come out! - Wait. Come out. How many more are inside? Where are you running? There's nothing to see. Get back. How many more are inside? Get everyone out. - Line them up over there. - Get everyone out. What's this? Come out fast! How many more? - Come out - Go there. One minute. Papa! Come. He's hurt. - Take him to the doctor. - Okay, sir. - Easy. - Be careful. Come here. Come down. Easy. Let's go. Keep moving! Let's go! Get me the first-aid box. Be careful. - I will bring it, sir. - Stay back. Sit down. Slowly. Move aside. I'll send the doctor. Press here. Yes, sir. Do sit-ups! - Come on! - Do sit-ups. Do sit-ups! Where did you pick them up, rascal? - Where's the money? - I don't have any, sir. - How much did you charge them? - Nothing, sir. - Ram Singh-ji… - What did you guys pay? Listen… - That man is injured. - Yes, sir. What did the driver say? Excuse me. Check it. Child, move aside. Let me attend to him. Don't worry. - Have a look. - Yes. Pass me the first-aid box. Hold him. Where are you going? Where are you going? Catch them! Catch him! Catch him! Bring him! Sit! Come on! Gather them together and file a report. Yes, sir. Stand guard over them. Do sit-ups! Dubey… I know it's getting out of hand. But don't lose heart. We got here somehow, so we'll get home somehow. We'll get out of here, come what may. Let's go. Come with me. Move. Come. Give it to them. - Brother. - Give it. Excuse me. What are you doing? Take it, sir. We have extra boxes. The kids are hungry. Let them eat. Feed your extras to animals. We're vegetarians. This is vegetarian. Puri-bhaji. We don't want your puri-bhaji. You're spreading Corona across the country. So spare our children. Allahu Akbar. Get down! Who accepted the food? Give it back! Give me that. Well? Do we have to beg for food now? Is anybody dying of hunger? Sir, please… Get inside. How did they breathe inside the mixer? They're daily wage workers, ma'am. Without any work for 21 days, how will they survive? If they starve to death in the village, at least they'll be with their families. So they're going home. Recognize her? Yes. She was asking for help on the highway. She found her way here somehow. Why do people still consider daughters to be a burden? When these people first moved to the city, they were thrown into the deep end. They did not know how to swim, but they had to stay in the city. Swim or sink. What choice does a person have? There was no work in the village. - Stay inside! - We are not the ones spreading it! - You people are spreading it. - Get inside! Go inside! - Get inside! - You're spreading Corona everywhere. - Uncle, who are you staring at? - Don't you dare step out. - Push them inside. - Get in! - Make way for me! - They roam around and spread Corona. Wait a minute! Why only them? You get back too. Where's your mask? Get back to your car. - Madam, they're spreading Corona. - Don't tell me who is doing what. You're not wearing a mask, so get back. - What's happening? - Why are you scolding us? - They're spreading Corona. - I told you to get back. What the hell! Madam, let me handle this. Get back! - What's all this bullshit? - Move. - Get them tested first. - Wear your mask first. Why shout at us, Ram Singh-ji? They're spreading Corona. Come here. You keep getting worked up. What shall I tell the minister? I was his personal security. How many cars do you have? Incredible India. What the hell is wrong with you, dude? No, seriously? I just find it incredible. What? I mean, look at that. Does that look like a country to you? Any semblance to a society? Of course, it looks like a country. Of course, it looks like a society. Of course, it's screwed up a bit. A lot, actually. Convent school education has made us believe all of India is comfortable and cozy as our little worlds. No, it's not, damn it! It's uncomfortable. It's inconvenient, but it's still incredible! From your hilltop of privilege, you find the countryside beautiful. Under that hill, another India is buried. So, if you see there's a problem, get your delicate feet dirty and bloody fix it. Or else go to the US immigration office and beg for a green card. They have a lot of Indians there. If you know what I mean. Native Indians. Jai Hind, sir. Sir, the situation is getting worse. Surya, call me later. - I'm getting my parents admitted. - Sir, two minutes. Okay, sir. Take care of them. I'll manage things. What's there to be managed? There are a lot of kids here, but no food's been arranged. A few pregnant women too. One might go into labor soon. People are getting all riled up. I'm worried about what will happen at nightfall… - Till the orders come from the meeting… - What meeting? Sir, didn't you say… there was a meeting about getting the migrants home? There's no such meeting. That was all rumor. - Sir, your beds are over here. - Here, in the hospital… That's already taken. Sorry, sir. Your beds… There's a long line here for hospital beds. Use the thermometer, record the temperature, and… Sir, these are your two beds. Sir, I was thinking since the mall is closed now, people could sleep the night in the mall lobby. There's a washroom too. It would... You're going to upset society's balance, Surya Kumar Singh-ji. Once a mall's been constructed, the workers never step inside it again. Got it? Tradition demands those defying caste and class get their asses whipped. Every wound marks the boundary that defines one's place in society. My status has determined my authority here. That's why a mattress has been put on the floor, so my parents can lie on it as they battle Corona. If they survive, they come home. If not, they'll be burned in plastic shrouds. Manage things there. I'll manage things here. Yes, sir. Jai Hind. Stop crying. All the food shops are closed. Stop crying! Brother… I made a mistake. I thought we'd get out of here quickly. Are any food boxes left? Brother, everything's been distributed. Listen to me. How many times must I tell you? You can't get through. Why can't I talk to the officer-in-charge? Ram sir is coming, talk to him. - I want to talk to the officer-in-charge. - Don't try my patience. - I just want to talk to him. - I won't let you go. - How can you stop me? - Stay back. - For the last time, let me go. - Call Ram Singh, sir. Hey! - Where to? - Let me talk to the officer-in-charge. - What's going on? - You can't. Let me talk to him. Let him be, Durgesh. What happened, Mr. Trivedi? I am requesting you, sir. About what? Has there been any update from that meeting? There was no meeting. No update is coming. Do you understand? I'm begging you, let us go home. I had to leave my village home to find work in the city. I'm a simple watchman there. Everyone at home thinks I work in security. My father was a priest. He used to make horoscopes. For the sake of his dignity, I don't tell them the whole truth. Since I left home, I haven't got anywhere. I'm nowhere… I left home. Now I'm coming back home again. Back home… I'm desperate, sir. All the children are crying. I feel humiliated. This has never happened before. I'd rather die than be humiliated in front of my family. If Biseswar doesn't get back with food in an hour, I'm going inside this mall. I'm just letting you know, sir. I've worked in a mall too. Food courts are stacked with food. This can't happen. I can't let children starve when there's so much food inside. Not possible. You'll break the law? I'm requesting you with folded hands… Arrange some food for us. We'll pay for it… - How dare you come here? - Let me talk. How dare you lay a finger on a policeman? Let me talk to him. Hey! I won't let you steal, Mr. Trivedi. Acting like a Naxali, Trivedi? Asking for food makes me a Naxali? Want to be a Naxali? How dare you! Take him away. One hour! I'll wait an hour. You can't stop me after that. I'm warning you. We travel miles from home to earn bread for the family. The mall is just a few meters away. - You can't stop us. - Take him away. Get lost! He's not wrong. He wants to steal. He begged too. I can't allow it. It's an order. - It's unjust. - Is stealing just? No. But this is justice served by the powerful. Didn't you say justice should be the same for everyone? Well? Right now, my idea of justice is way above my status. Yadav-ji made that clear. Why did you become the "in-charge" then? Rest here, I'll be back. - Kanhaiyya? - Yes, ma'am. Look. No one can stop her. I tell you what, drive to the end of the queue. She'll find a way out of here. But the road is blocked… Take the road from where the mixer came. Ma'am, but… Kanhaiyya, I must get to Navya before my husband does. Where is your mask? Pull it on. Yes, show me your hand. We and four other men will guard the checkpoint. - Sir! - Sir! Two men will guard the main entrance. Pull the shutter down. The others stay near the mall. Not a soul must enter the mall. - Sir! - Sir! Check all positions and meet me at the checkpoint. Let's go. You five go there, and the rest come with me. We will round this place up. He's the CO of Tejpur. Both his parents have a fever. A general ward will do. You know Subhash Yadav-ji, right? He refuses, sir. This hospital belongs to his community. Beds are reserved for their members. Fine. They're my parents. So… take care of them. Yes? We had to make do with the floor. People like us don't get beds. Let's go. Jai Hind, sir. Sir, I'll need 25 more men. I need them for an hour. You made me the office-in-charge here, so trust me, sir. Jai Hind, sir. Ram Singh-ji… You guys go ahead. What is it? How many gunners do we have? Two. They're over there. Call one of them. Gun? Call one of them. - Really? - It is important. At least ask him. Sir! Call one of them. - Let her come. - Thank you. Surya Kumar Singh-ji, can we talk? - Tell me. - Not here. On camera. I have a primetime show, "On Point with Vidhi Prabhakar." - Impossible now. - It's very important. It's about how fake news is affecting the Muslim bus… Muslim bus? I mean the bus with Muslims. Is that the only bus you noticed? My show will highlight the harm this fake news has caused. If I had the time, I'd show just how much harm it's caused. Young girls have to use newspapers as sanitary pads. A humiliated father is ready to steal food for his kids. There are many such stories… My show is only half an hour… Our show is very long, madam. Step in our shoes sometime. It's not a story. It's a saga. An epic. Unwritten. Untold. So you write it. I can't help with your show. I'm off. I'm sorry I interfered with your work earlier. Report that "swearing incident" story if you want to. I may get suspended. But I don't care about my job anyway. There are more important things to do. Hey! Where to? - One hour has passed. - So? I won't beg anymore. - So? What will you do? - We're going inside the mall. Don't try to act smart, Trivedi! The officer-in-charge is coming. Remember your place. - What is it? - This "Singh" will tell me my place? We're heading to the mall. Stop us if you can. - Aren't you listening? - You can't stop me. Get back! Mr. Trivedi, don't do this! You people are unworthy of your uniform. You Tikas, don't forget who you are. Listen, Mr. Trivedi. If it weren't for your uniform, I would've whipped you. That's what you people deserve. Damn Tikas! If it weren't for your uniform… You're the real Singh now… I would've whipped you. That's what you people deserve. - And your father's name? - Damn Tikas! Move out! Move! Surya. Surya! Surya! Surya! He has a gun. Let's go! Surya! The scoundrel just fired. Check that end. - Cover the whole area. - Yes, sir. Don't let him escape. What happened, Mr. Thakur? Jai Hind, sir! Looks like Pakistan has attacked us. No, sir, it's the watchman, Trivedi. He's turned into a rebel. He took the gun inside. Where's Surya? - He's hurting. - Hurting? He is deeply hurting, sir, in his heart. He looks frozen. Hey! You want to kill him? They just asked for food. Nobody gave you the right to kill. Arrest him. Take him away. I can't become an "in-charge," just because they call me that. Things will change when I, a Tikas, can show you they've changed. Till then, you change, and so will I. Surya Kumar Tikas-ji… I'll marry only you. Let's go. Hurry. Snatch a gun from a cop? - Rob a mall? Let's put him in his place. - Yadav-ji. One minute. Listen to me, sir. Hurry up! I don't have time. - Where is Ramadeen? - He's here. Position him near the window. He's our best shooter. - Seal the gate! - And you. Get over there. - You three cover the other side. Quick! - I'm in charge, sir. - What? - I'm in charge here, sir. Wonderful! You finally rise to the occasion? I'm going inside, sir. Alone. A crime has been committed, and the culprit must be punished. Give me five minutes, sir. I'll talk to him. He won't shoot anyone. Sir, with Ramadeen… Promise. Let's position another shooter. Trivedi can't escape then. Five minutes, Yadav-ji. If a single cop gets hit… I'll blow him to pieces. Five minutes. Go. What happened? Keep going. Your car will be seen. We can sneak through on our cycle. Here. Get something to eat. Keep moving. Take it. Let's go. Kanhaiyya, let her go ahead. We'll see how deep the water is. Kanhaiyya, keep driving! So what if she fell? Don't stop the car. Kanhaiyya! Kanhaiyya! Come here, kid. - Hold onto the cycle. - Kanhaiyya! - Hold onto the cycle. - Kanhaiyya, it's getting late. Come. Kanhaiyya, what are you doing?! Kanhaiyya! Kanhaiyya, we're getting late. Come back. We've got to reach Navya. Kanhaiyya! You ungrateful man! Kanhaiyya! I came back, not because I'm helpless. But because you are. If we don't help each other, how will we make it? I'm sorry, Kanhaiyya. But, Navya… Mr. Trivedi. Nobody comes forward, or I shoot. I've come alone, Mr. Trivedi. There's only me. I've put my gun down. You don't need to respect the uniform now. I've seen my people bound and flogged. I'll take it too. You can flog me too if you want. The mistake was mine, Mr. Trivedi. I was unfair. So I must set things right. It's all upside down. You left for the city because there was no work for you here. You left the city because there was no more work there. You show up here, and there's still nothing for you. Poor folks are never planned for. Put the gun down. We'll sit and talk. Sir, I know you trust Surya. But he's not up to the job. We have to do something. We need to move in now! There's no time left. We'll find a way. I promise. I don't trust you. You have to. Hey! You lied to me. Yadav-ji, I told you I needed five minutes. Mr. Trivedi. Mr. Trivedi, get back! Mr. Trivedi… Get back! Mr. Trivedi… They'll shoot you. He's run out of bullets. Let's move in. He had only three bullets. One was fired outside, two here. Trivedi is officially a Naxal now. Kill him. Bend down. Nobody fire! I'll shoot him. Put your guns down. Guns down. Guns down, or I'll shoot him. Guns down. Everyone, get out. Get back. Move it. I've stolen nothing. I only requested… that I be given food. And said I'd pay for it. The children are starving, but no one listened to me. You people tricked me. No one move. Get out of here now. Out, I said! Can you hear me? Out. Yadav-ji… Put your guns down. Down, I said. Or I'll shoot. I'll shoot him. Move. - Move. Faster. - Ram Singh-ji, don't. That side. Whose motorcycle is that? Whose motorcycle is that?! - Give me the keys. - Give them to him. Stop. Throw them to me. Pick them up. Let's go. Let's go. I can't see the police jeep. Keep the gun pointed at me. I'll get off ahead. You take the bike and go. Go where? Dump the bike after five-six kilometers and run. Run where? - I've no idea. - What do you mean? - I have to get back to the checkpoint. - Me too. I must get back to the bus. To my family, my brother. Bloody half-hearted revolutionary! I'll shoot you if you try to trick me. Why should I run? What's my fault? That's a big question, what's your fault? You don't have the time. Save your life. Think hard, and you'll know what you've done. Go. You misled me. I tried to save your life. That's all the right and wrong I know. But what did I do wrong? - You asked for food, water, and shelter. - Is that wrong? - That's why I'm trying to help you. - This is unjust. Yes, it's unjust. It happens. But you only see it when you suffer. They're here. Go! Take the bike and go! - Where to? - Push me to the ground! - Where will I go? - Push me to the ground! Bloody motherfucker! Go after him. Surya! Surya! You let Trivedi escape on purpose? I'm asking you a question. I could shoot you and blame it on Trivedi. Go ahead, sir. Shoot me. In Trivedi's place, I would've done what he did. Go ahead. You can call me a Naxal too. Let's finish this. Shoot me, sir. You want to be a hero? A hero? Sure, sir. I want to be a hero, too. Absolutely, I do. How long must I keep serving the masters and heroes? Can I not aspire to be a hero too? In fact, you should become a hero too. The headman's brother thrashed my relative right there. You didn't even file a police report, sir. Yadav-ji… let go of all your power you have. After that what's left… will be real justice. I'm going, sir. I have a checkpoint to take care of. Sir, I'm still the in-charge, right? Got him, sir. What's the order? Tell me, sir. Let go of all your power. After that what's left… will be real justice. Sir? That's what your officer-in-charge said. All my power? That's difficult, sir. It is. But you can try. Okay. I'll give it a go. Everyone, back in the jeep. Okay. Come. Move it. Let's go. Why were you bragging about your money? In the mall too, you said, "Take my money." How much money do you have? Come. Let's work something out. What if I didn't have this money? This food isn't enough for everyone, so feed the children first. There are 22 of us policemen. We're arranging food from our homes. No one will sleep hungry tonight. Don't worry. - We'll see what the morning brings. - Sir. You look worn out. My father called. I told him… I'm in love with Surya Kumar Tikas-ji. Did you really tell him? What did he say? He said, "Come home. I'll teach you a lesson." You'll come with me, right? If you come along, I'm willing to visit your village again. With my slippers on. In the city My blood and sweat, brother Is sold for a handful of coins In the city My blood and sweat, brother Is sold for a handful of coins Let's fly back to the village Where the soil is sprinkled with gold Where the soil is sprinkled with gold
