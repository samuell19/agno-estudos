(MultiCom Jingle) - [TV Host] Eye witness news with Dave McElhatton and Lynne Joiner. Joe Bartlett with weather and Wayne Walker with sports. - Good evening, I'm Dave McElhatton. Although we not have official confirmation from the police department at this hour, we do have inside information on the city's latest murder victim, another, the third of those bizarre killings that the police have been calling the Missing Heart Murders. Our reporter on the scene earlier tonight wasn't able to learn much in this attempted interview with Detective Clancy Higgins who is in charge of the investigation. - No comment. - [Reporter] Do you have nothing else to say? - No comment. - Higgins has been very difficult. That's as much as we can get as we try to pursue the story. (dramatic music) (muffled background chatter) - [Officer] Stand back for your own safety, please. There is nothing to be seen here. Please stand back, stay behind the ropes. Please stay behind the ropes. Please go home, people, don't gather here. There's nothing to be seen. We have it completely under control. Please stay back for your own safety. Please stand back. Please stand back for your own safety. - Got us something on the ropes about the garages? - [Officer] Captain, we've got a suspect outside room 207. - We're on our way. Come on, Wong, that's the murder victim's room. (suspenseful music) - Captain. (music swells and intensifies) (taps) - Jesus, Higgins, the way you work. - Okay one thing, he didn't bring the body in that way. I almost broke my neck getting in by myself. But I'll tell ya, I found these surgical gloves, dropped in front of the hotel right in plain view on the street in the middle of the crowd. - Is that any way to handle evidence? - Well if there are any prints, they'll be on the inside. Woman, huh? - That's right. Maybe you shouldn't look. This one's been pretty badly cut up, but not as bad as some of the others. I think the killer was scared off before he could finish. - Done the same stuff, huh? - Same M.O., the heart's missing. (Higgins retches) - Higgins, stay outta that bathroom! We haven't dusted for prints yet! (Higgins vomits) Higgins? If you so much as spoil one lousy print, I'll have your ass! (Higgins coughs) - You got any gum? - No. - Listen, Captain, I think I should get outta here and Wylie and I should work out what he's got and work on our plans. - Oh, great. But tell me somethin', Higgins. What kind of cop pukes every time he sees a body? - A thin cop, I guess. (Wylie giggles) - Shh! (man coughs) For heaven's sake be quiet or they'll find you. I think they're coming here. - Who'd you talk to? - Well, the manager says there's a lady down in 208 who heard the screams. Is she still there? Come on. - Let's talk to her tomorrow, huh? I don't feel like it tonight. - [Wylie] Come on, let's get it over with. Come on. (knocks) - [Woman] Who is it? - Police officers, ma'am. Detectives Higgins and Wong from Homicide. We'd like to talk to you for just a moment. - [Woman] Surely. But it'll take me a few minutes to dress. - Yes, ma'am, take all the time you need. (clunks and thuds) - I hope you won't consider it impolite if I ask to see your identification. - Not at all, no no. - Oh, sure. - One can't be too sure these days. - You're quite right. - I already spoke with an officer. - Yes, ma'am, we'd just like to run over the details one more time, if you don't mind. It won't take very long at all. - Alright. - Thank you. Ma'am, could I possibly have a glass of water? - Oh, certainly. (water runs) - Thank you. Just tell us what happened, please. - Well, I was frosting a cake, for Clara's welcome home party. She's the lady who had been in the hospital. She lives in the room across from where... And I heard this dreadful scream. (woman screams) I naturally thought it was Clara. It gave me such a shock that I nearly ruined the cake. That would have been awful, because everybody loves my cakes. Spice with chocolate frosting. I bake it from scratch, none of those mixes. - After the cake, what happened after the cake? - Well, when I heard that scream, I ran to the front door and I saw the man running from that room. He was in an awful panic. Won't you gentlemen sit down and have a nice big piece? - No, thank you. - We're gonna eat later. - Oh well, um. (man coughs) (suspenseful music) You're sure you won't have a piece of cake? - No thank you, ma'am, and as a matter of fact I'd really like to see what's in that closet. - Please don't arrest him, he didn't do anything. - You can put your hands down, sir. - But I only took the suitcase, I didn't kill anyone. - That's right. Duke Southwick was here when I heard the scream. - [Wylie] That's Southwick? - Oh, you know this gentleman, Wylie? - [Wylie] Yeah, he's the guy that was picketing in front of the hotel. - Mr. Southwick, I am through warning you. I'm going to call the police! - Mr. Singh, you can't expect an old man to walk up and down the street like this. - The least you could do is dress decently. Your attire is ruining my business. - If you're so concerned about how I dress in your overpriced hotel, all you need do is return my belongings. - Ah but you should have thought of that when you started this socialist rent strike of yours! - Don't you point your finger at me again, or I'll cut it off! - That's it, I'm going to call the police! - [Wylie] The radio guys were responding to him when Mrs. Swan heard the scream. - I can explain everything. The only thing Duke Southwick did that might have been a little wrong was take the suitcase. Better give them the suitcase, Elton. - This is the suitcase? - The murderer dropped it. And then he ran down the hall. - No kidding. Jesus Christ, this thing is brand new. - Goin' home? - Most of the material and I can go to Pandora's and grab a bite. - Higgins, it's crawling with newsmen out there, so, try to keep away from them. The Chief's put a lid on this case until we know a few more things. - No comment. - What's with the suitcase? - Evidence. The only thing that we can tell from this is that the guy we're looking for has a finger. What about the gloves? - Industry standard, used by every hospital in the area. - Terrific, that simplifies everything. I mean so all we have to do is check out every hospital worker in 50-square-miles. What do you think, Liz, will it do any good to send these partials to the Bureau? - I've already done it. I just hope that we can get enough of that lower swirl to make an ID, they're set up for that. - Yeah. No, that's a long shot, anyway. - Mr. And Mrs. Gregory. The test results weren't very promising. As Dr. Kelly's diagnosis indicated, you are suffering from severe rheumatic valvular heart disease and according to our most recent studies, your condition is deteriorating rapidly. - But I feel fine. You're releasing me from the hospital today. - I know. We're releasing you today because there isn't much we can do for you here, short of a transplant. - A heart transplant? - Now, I know that a heart transplant sounds drastic, but you're young and otherwise in good health, which is the key asset in this type of procedure. And my success ratio is very high, so I see no reason for you to worry. (lively flute music) - Ow. - You're dead, copper. - From the looks of this, it must be Inspector Higgins. - Did you see that exhibit of South American blowguns and darts in the other room? - Is that where you got that from? - Listen, those darts are coated with curare, which is really a deadly weapon. I mean, those things will kill you deader than hell. - Well, given the choice, I think I'll go with my 38. - I'm not so sure because if a 38 hits you in the shoulder, you can still come back. But if one of those things hits you in the big toe, you're done for, there's nothing you can do about it. - Okay, you take your straws and your dart. I'll take my 38, 25 paces opposite ends of the hall. - [Higgins] (chuckles) You're on. - Look at this. Somebody you know? - Yeah, see these guys killed each other for thousands of years, without any 38s. They did a pretty good job of it, too, sometimes. - Yeah, I bet. But that poison you're talking about's 100 years old, huh? - I don't care. I bet it's still as strong as it was the day it was made. - A bet? Okay, 10 bucks. - Okay, I'll tell you what, tell you what. You're on for 20. - Alright. - Alright. Where's this woman we're supposed to meet? - I think that's her right now. Hi. - Inspector Wong? - Right. - I'm Dr. Tucker, sorry to have kept you waiting. - Oh, no problem. This is my partner, Inspector Higgins. - How do you do? - Since you telephoned this morning I've found several interesting items. - Terrific. - As you can see, there were quite a number of cultures that did engage in just the sort of ritual cannibalism you asked about. Now according to the literature, they believed that consuming the heart of your enemy gave you his strength. - But according to this the only tribe that still practices this ritual is in Borneo. - Yes, that's right. - But you don't think any of these people from Borneo or some group like that could be running around loose here? - Oh, you thought that some local group? Oh, no, I'm sorry. - Well it's interesting to know how widespread something like this is, you know? - Mm-hm. - I guess it's not surprising though, huh? There's no act so vile you can't find some human being to perform it for you, right? (Tucker chuckles) - Yes, well, I'm sorry, but if there's anything else I can help you with-- - Well yes, ma'am, as a matter of fact there is. You know that exhibit in the next room of the South American blowguns and the darts? We're working on a case right now that involves curare, and I wonder if we could borrow one of those darts and have it tested at the police lab, we wanna see whether the curare is still active after all this time. - Well, um-- - We'd take very good care of it, and it would be very helpful to the police. - Well (chuckles) I suppose it might be interesting. - Appreciate it very much. - Thanks. (moody atmospheric music) - I'm sorry for the interruption. I'll try and get through this as quickly as possible. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask them. - Right, thank you, doctor. - You see, the body has a defense mechanism which rejects any protein substance different from its own. What you see here magnified many thousands of times are these defense mechanisms which we call antibodies. These antibodies are produced by the body in reaction to any foreign proteins which come into contact with it. We call these foreign proteins antigens. Now what this means quite simply is that an organ which has been transplanted will be rejected by the body unless the antigen materials are minimized, that is, the transplanted heart must come from someone whose body issue is similar to your own. We determine this by a process called tissue-matching. - Is it a difficult process? Does it take a long time? - [Doctor] Uh, the process itself, no. Finding a suitable donor, yes. We usually have to wait for a donor to come along. These are usually accident victims or perhaps a suicide. Once we locate a donor with healthy organs that match your own, we operate on a moment's notice. - Okay. What are my chances for survival? - I'd say that at your age and general physical condition, your chances of making it through the operation are excellent. However, if you're referring to our chances of finding a suitable donor, I'll have to be blunt. That pretty much depends upon luck. (moody atmospheric music) - See, those were North American Indians in that place where we were. I think mainly they didn't use poison darts as such. They used to chew and bite each other to death. (Wylie laughs) This is great. - Hey, watch where you point that thing. - I thought you had $20 that said it was harmless. - Ah, don't worry about it. Where do you wanna go eat? - I got some sandwiches here from Pinoli's. - Pinoli's? - Yeah - Sure. - I thought you'd go for a free lunch. - Ah, well you know. - Let's go. If it was a cult, it wouldn't be anything really historical, you know, nothing real, it'd be somethin' some maniac made up. And I don't think it's a group of people like a cult. I think it's one guy and he's got a reason for it. And that's what I need, I know there's a reason. What do you want, roast beef or roast beef? - Roast beef. - Good choice. - It's the same, alright. The same level of anesthetic. - Right. Loads of it. Needle marks all over her body. A couple in the neck, even. She's dehydrated, no food and very little drink for days. - Same cuts on the stomach. - Yeah, doctor says those gouges in the stomach were made by a knife. And the same knife stabbed three times around the heart, but the heart was removed really neatly, as usual, with something really small and sharp like a scalpel or a stiletto. - You know, what I don't understand is, how he got her into that hotel. I mean, she must have been stoned out of her brains. - Don't be simple-minded. - Oh, here it comes. - She didn't walk in there, she was carried in there! It's a different woman. - Will you hold on? We got two witnesses who saw him check in. - We got two people who said they saw a hat. That's all they ever really said. Yes, that's her hat. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. - May I help you, please? - Yeah, I'd like a room. - [Singh] Please fill out the registration form. - Certainly. - [Singh] Thank you. Mr. And Mrs. Eaton. - Yeah. - Room 207. I'm sure the accommodations will meet with your approval. I'll have the bell man bring up your bags. - Oh that'd be nice, thank you very much. - No. Not that's alright, we can manage. - Fine. - I guess not. Thank you anyway. - Enjoy yourselves. - We will. - It's simple, they checked in, he killed her. The old woman heard the screams and saw him split. - Scream. - What? - She heard a scream, not screams. - Alright, he heard a scream. And he left the suitcase behind, so what about the suitcase? - It's in the report. The only prints on it are yours, mines and Southwick's. - Okay so it shouldn't be too hard to trace. - Terrific. Well I'm going back to the hotel and I'm gonna talk to those people and I'm gonna look around. There's gotta be somethin' there that tells me how that body got up there. - Damnit, Clance, we know how she got in there, she walked! - You mean it walked, 'cause it was dead! - Ah, Jesus. - [Clancy] Well you don't have all he answers, my friend. - The only thing close to an answer we have is that damn suitcase. You've been reading too much Sherlock Holmes or somethin'. - Sherlock Holmes my ass. You're the smart detective, you got the degree. You're the one with the scientific methods. I'm just a dumb clop playin' the angles. - Agreed. - Yeah, the only thing I got to go on, are my judgment an my instincts. - Okay, go on your instincts and your judgment and retire. I'm gonna go check the suitcase thing. Have a sandwich. - We both call it at four, alright? - [Wylie] Yeah. (bluesy guitar music) - I can't remember the man. We get people comin' here all the time, goin' and comin'. I'm not very good at remembering faces. - Come on, anything, height, weight, color of hair, eyes, scars, you know, stuff like that. - No, nothin'. I'll be right with you, ma'am. But I tell you, he was in a real hurry. - In a hurry how? Nervous, twitchy or did he just move fast? - Very nervous, didn't even wanna wait until I verified the credit card. Kept tellin' me "it's good, it's good." Finally I said "look mister, it's only good "when the bank tells me it's good. "Either you wait until they verify the purchase, "or you pay cash." - So he paid with cash? - No, suddenly he found time. - Why the hell didn't you tell me he paid with a credit card? - What's the difference? - The difference, look, unless the card was stolen, which I doubt, his name and address are on the receipt. You got a copy of it somewhere, right? - That's right, that's right. I'll take me a minute to find it, though. The wife usually does the books. (suspenseful music) (blaring vacuum) - Fred? Fred, come here, quick, the car! - What is it, babe? - I don't know, come here. - I'll get him. (suspenseful music) - At least let me in the room to clean it, then maybe I-- - Uh, no, my orders are that nobody except for a few Homicide cops gets into this room. There's somebody that you might talk with. - Yes, sir. - Policeman Higgins. You're just the man I wanted to talk to. Perhaps you can tell me how you expect me to run a hotel with policemen everywhere. It's ruining my business. - There's only one policeman anywhere, Mr. Singh, and he's right here and as soon as I go in the room, and check things out, then we'll take the sign down and we'll all go away. - Do you know what it costs to keep a hotel room unrented? - Well I can tell you this, Mr. Singh. The longer you and I stand here talking, the longer it's gonna take me to get in there and get to work. Duke Miller. - Right. It's been a long time, Inspector. - Yeah, I met you at old man Higgins' funeral. - Ah, God rest his soul. - What are you doin' here? I thought you were in northern. - Beats me, I guess they're short of manpower at central. Pulled off me off my beach shift into here. Yeah, it's too bad about the gal. That's a little bigger than more than just a picture in the paper. - You mean you know her? - Oh I can't exactly say I knew her. She was mugged a couple of weeks back. Pearson asked her something, I responded to the call. I don't remember it exactly, she was pretty shook up. - Was she beat up pretty bad? - Not too bad, you know, a couple of minor bruises, a puncture wound on her arm, frightened more than anything. - Well it's like any other town. It can be pretty tough at times. Listen, you know this is pretty much wrapped up. I'm gonna go in there and take a look around. Why don't you take off? I'll straighten it out with the captain. Good to see you again. - You too, Clancy. See you around. (dramatic music) - Frederico Etoni, you have five-- - [Fred] Antoinette, get down! Get down, keep your head down, please. I don't know what the hell's going on. They got the wrong house, I don't know what's happening. - What do you mean they got the wrong house? They know your name! What you been doing? Running around with Rita again? (Frederico speaks foreign language) - Frederico Etoni! You have five minutes to throw down your weapon and come out with your hands over your head! - Antoinette, please stay down! I tell you, I don't know what they're doing here. - Oh Christ, will you do something? (suspenseful music) Oh my god, the kids. The kids will be home from school any minute. - [Wylie] Etoni, come out with your hands over your head! Hold your fire, hold your fire. He's coming out. We have our man here. He's coming out. We'll bring him in. (moody atmospheric music) - [Officer] If I'm home late again my wife will kill me. - [Fred] That's exactly what happened. The body was in the room when we got there. - Why run? - I was scared. I never thought you guys would be able to trace me. When Janice screamed, I saw my whole life falling apart. My marriage. My job. I couldn't do anything else but run. - The woman backs his story. - Oh, Christ. I mean you could have come to us. I mean don't you read the papers? They were full of stories we were lookin' for ya. Then the shotgun, what was that all about? - I was scared. I never thought you guys would be able to trace me. And as far as the gun, I saw you poking around my garage. I thought maybe you were a car thief. Next thing I knew there were cops everywhere. - Well, I guess this changes things around. I guess you're free to go. - Free to go? What am I gonna tell my wife? My neighbors. The way you guys dragged me away from there? What the hell am I gonna tell 'em? - Come on, Fred. We'll do the best we can. It's been an embarrassment to all of us. - Wylie, you should have given me a call before you brought an army over there. - I got tired of asking you for help. I got a Board of Inquiry hanging over my head. I don't need you on my case. - Listen, if it's a Board of Inquiry, you know that I'm gonna back you, I mean, that's what partners are for, right? - Yeah. (melancholic music) (phone rings) - I have to get to the phone. (phone rings) - [Caller] I can arrange for your wife to get the heart she needs. - Could you repeat that, please, I'm not sure I understood. - [Caller] I said that I can arrange it so that your wife gets a new heart. If you're interested. - Who is this? - Never mind who I am. And don't be in such a hurry to believe all that stuff about tissue matching. The doctor tells that story to everyone because there just aren't enough hearts to go around, it's kind of a supply and demand situation, if you know what I mean. It's really a matter of moving your wife's name to the top of a list. (blaring train horn) Or would you rather be leaving it up to chance the doctor suggested? (blaring train horn) Look, if you're interested we can meet and talk it over. - I need a few days to think that over. - [Caller] I'll give you until tomorrow afternoon. You wait for my call then. (engaged tone) - You wanna pour me a cup? - Uh. Doctor said no caffeine, didn't he? - I don't think one cup of coffee's gonna change the course of history. (coffee pours) Thanks. Leigh? - Yeah, hon? - What if I've lost my luck? - Were you listening on the extension? I think he's an extortionist. We should probably call the police. - And what if he's telling the truth? What if there are lists? I wanna know why you didn't tell me about the phone call. (Leigh sighs) - Well, I didn't wanna broach it with you. I didn't wanna upset you, hon, until I had time to think it over. You know I'll do everything I can. Oh come on, who are we? Huh? (chuckles) Huh? (chuckles) Alright. - [Clancy] Well, Sun Lin, I don't know how to figure it. I've got three bodies with no hearts, and no other clues. - Your questions reminds me of the time during the Second World War. The authorities were looking to uncover a smuggling scheme. They came to me and said they can't understand what this man is smuggling. All we find when we open the jars is mineral oil. It's not illegal to import mineral oil. They never realized it was the jars. Very valuable Chinese artifacts. Which to the unaccustomed might look ordinary. - I never thought of that. Black market. - I wasn't talking about black market, but of the obvious things which we never notice. - That's the obvious thing that we haven't noticed. Goodbye, my friend. - What's the hurry? - [Clancy] I have to go, I just thought of something. - There are no priority lists. I wish there were, for your sake, but for myself I'm thankful that medicine still hasn't come to that. What a burden that would be. Sit down there, let me tell you something. There's no way of speeding up the process. - I don't understand, how do people get hearts? There are people in Texas, there are people in South Africa. Look. What I'm trying to tell you is that, we're fortunate. We have... We have a good business and, and if we need to fly anywhere or, do anything-- - Dianne, Dianne listen to me. My father always said there were two things in life that money couldn't buy, health and happiness. I always thought that he was making up excuses for his own personal shortcomings but he was right. You must have patience. If fate wills you a new heart, you'll have it. - I will not be patient! I've been patient all my... (chuckles) How can you not understand what's going on here? You told me yesterday that I'm gonna die! And you're telling me now to be patient? Come on, doctor. (somber orchestral music) - I'm Norton Williams now what in damnation's going on here? - I'm Clancy Higgins, doctor. I know I'm intruding and I'm sorry but I didn't think you were taking me very seriously on the phone. - Inspector I told you this morning in no uncertain terms that I'm a busy man and I don't have time for such foolishness. - I understand it, sir, I only need a few minutes of your time and it could be very important. Now, you must know about the heart murder cases. In fact, I think it would be very interesting to you. Well, I've been working on that case for months. It's very confusing. I've gone through every angle. Gang killings, weird occult groups, that sort of thing. But this morning, I had an idea about a black market in human organs. I have to know if that's possible. - The answer is no, impossible. I find the entire idea both appalling and insulting. - [Clancy] Why? - I don't have time to get into the whys. I have patients who need my care. Inspector, you'll just have to trust me. We're talking about complex medical procedures, not a simple appendectomy, complex procedures that need years of medical training to understand. - Okay doctor, I tell you what, since you can't answer my question, maybe I'll have to call a press conference and just ask the world. - If this crazy idea of yours ever got out to the press, it would set organ transplant surgery back 50 years. - Look at it this way, if I'm crazy enough to think of it, I'm crazy enough to call a press conference. - Alright. I'll give you some time. Meet me outside the intensive care unit in about 20 minutes. - Thank you very much, sir. - Richie! Richie Walker! - Harvey Nichols! Damn. It's good to see you, man. I didn't recognize you. - Yeah, I didn't recognize you either with all that hip glitter on. - What you talkin' about? Guess this comes from goin' to med school in the southwest. It just kind of grows on you, you know what I mean? So what you into, man? - Well I, uh, I couldn't get into med school. So I took the only job I was halfway qualified for, I, started driving a city ambulance, did that for a couple of years and managed to save enough money to buy this rig and here I am. The last time I heard, you were, uh, you were studying criminology over at Cal. - Ah no, I got outta that one, yeah. I figured it's easier catching microbes than criminals, you know what I mean? You look like you're doin' okay here. - Yeah, yeah, I'm still paying for this thing, though. You look like you're doin' alright. - Well, I'm doin' okay. Residency's a far-out thing but not where the bucks are concerned, you know what I mean? So my old lady and I got a little business on the side. It's workin' out. (car horn honks) Ah listen, I really liked talkin' to you. It's great seein' you and all that, but I think my old lady is getting a little impatient, you know what I mean, I got to go. Take care of yourself. - Yeah, I'll catch you around. - [Richie] Right. - That guy looks like he's doin' alright, huh? - Yeah, he always did pretty good. Pretty good-lookin' old lady, too. - Yeah, check that one out. Where'd you know him from? - Knew him overseas. - What, in the service? - Yeah. - Was he a doctor or something? - We were on the medevacs together. - [Friend] Oh, yeah? - Nice-lookin' car. - Yeah. - Hey. Didn't you years ago, didn't you work in that grocery store out in Terre Haute? - Yeah. - Yeah, I remember you were just a kid then. What ever happened to that old woman, is she still alive? - No, she died a couple years ago. - Yeah, the place is still there. The same name, I saw it the other day. Well, who was that guy you were just talkin' to? The guy with the Cadillac. - Oh, Richie Walker. - Richie Walker. What's he do? - I guess he's doing some sort of residency here. - Ah ha. - We were in Vietnam together, see we were in the medevacs. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Inspector Higgins. - Oh doctor, hi. I guess we can talk now, I'll just put this thing away. (somber atmospheric music) - Leigh. The caller didn't say what time he'd call today, did he? - No, he didn't. Hell, he might not even call. - I wanna talk to the caller. - Um. Baby, I don't think I can deal with that choice. - What are you talking about? You said yourself 100 times that a little money under the table isn't unusual! - Not-- - It's just a matter right now of putting a little grease on the wheels and make the whole thing go smoother. - That's different. - How is that different than you spending all that money to make your way to the top? - Dianne, we're not talkin' about paying off some electrical inspector or some other clown with a big ego problem. There's a lot more here. - What? What are you talking about? - We're talkin' about murder. - Oh, come on, you can't be sure of that. - No, well... - I think putting my name up on the list is a lot different thing than murder. - Well I'm not so sure that's what this is. (clunk) I'm sorry, I, honey, I'm thinking we should be calling the police. - Oh great, great idea! And then what do we have? We have a petty criminal who's arrested before he gets a chance to put my name up on the list! And he spends the rest of his life in jail while I spend my life, is that what you want? - No, that's not what I want, what are you talkin' about? - I'm talking about that I wanna live. That's it. I wanna be in my house, I wanna be with my child, I wanna be... (sobs) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Come here. Hello. Yeah, go on. Yeah, I understand. Yes, I'll be there. (phone keypad chimes) - The Mayor's office, please. Dr. Norton Williams. No, his administrative assistant will be fine. Hello, Josh. Fine. I've just had a curious visitor from the police department. Higgins from Homicide. He has a notion about the rash of heart murders being connected with, get this, a black market in human organs. I don't think we can afford that kind of publicity. - Hi. I want double-dip, one mocha almond fudge, and one mint chip on a sugar cone. Holy. Hey, hey! Hey! That's a police vehicle! - You son of a bitch! - Alright, I'm sorry about last night. I was busy, I was working. - Yeah I know, I saw you on television. It was cute, "no comment." - I guess you cooked dinner and everything, right? - I made you squid! - Squid? - [Woman] You don't like squid, huh? You wear a tie like that. - Tiffany, what about my truck? What am I supposed to do? - I don't know, Clance, maybe I'll give you a lift home. (both laugh) (upbeat piano music) (suspenseful string music) - [Caller] I'd like to invite you up for a drink, Mr. Gregory, but, under the circumstances, I don't think that would be wise. Shall we get down to discussing our little business arrangement? - Well since you're not gonna invite me in, this might be as good a place as any. - [Caller] As I said on the phone, I can arrange to have your wife's transplant surgery any time you want it. How does that sound? - Sounds like it's gonna cost me a lot of money. - [Caller] But worth it, Mr. Gregory, worth it. Now I think the price is fair, $200,000. - How do I know I can trust you? What kind of guarantees do I have that you'll deliver? - [Caller] For the answer of that question you'll just have to wait a minute, Mr. Gregory, someone's coming. I appreciate your caution. Under the mat you will find an envelope with your instructions. Please read them carefully. As the instructions indicate, you are to place the money in escrow in a numbered Swiss bank account with the provision that the money is to be transferred into another account, mine, on the day following completion of your wife's surgery. My bank will notify me of the transfer. Goodbye, Mr. Gregory. - I'll need some time to raise this cash. Hello? Hello? (upbeat piano music) - That was a great ride. (chuckles) - Feel good? - You're completely out of your mind, you're nuts. - Completely nuts. (both laugh) Clancy. - Come on, Higgins. You're holding up traffic, I see. - That's not all he's holding. - Yeah but the meters are running, huh? People are double-parked on Poke Street right now. - What are you doin'? - Taking this. - Listen, I'm gonna try to call as soon as I can, but this one is a bitch and I'm workin' hard, so it's-- - Oh, Clancy. - Hey, Higgins, how you doin'? - How you doin', Goody? - Goody's okay, Goody's been over the truck. It's perfect, it's clean, what the hell's wrong with it? - The glove compartment don't work. - What? - The glove compartment don't work. - You had this thing towed because of a glove compartment? I don't believe you. - It's busted, it don't work. Every time I hit a bump or slam the door, the glove compartment opens and the radio goes on. - Well, listen, every other cop I know has a radio safely fastened underneath the dash, right? And you need a glove compartment, you need a button activating on the door? What's your story? - I guess I'm just peculiar. But listen, don't put it down. That thing has saved my ass a number of times. - Yeah but it's 18 times we're doing it, what is it now? - Now it's too loose. - Now it's too loose. - Yeah, I told you. Every time I hit a bump, the thing goes on. - Okay, I told you I got a lot of stuff here, transmissions, a lot of stuff, two hours, we'll take care of it all. - Okay I'll tell you what I'll do, I'm gonna go over and have some coffee, right? I'll be back in about 20 minutes, see ya. - 20 minutes? Hey, Clancy! - So, how you been since the last deal we made? - When was that? Oh, yeah. - A year and a half? Is that what it was, 18? Yeah, a year and a half. - Uh-huh. - Exactly a year and a half, we did very nicely on that. - Did you? - Yeah we made a lot of money. - Glad to hear it. - Opened up a whole new area-- - Oh, hang on a second. (phone buzzes) Hello. Yeah. Fine. And the transfer will be made by our Swiss correspondent? Good. Thanks, Foster. Money will be in Switzerland by the end of the business day. - That's great, Doug, I appreciate it. - Look, if you're gonna make a killing, I'd like to be in on it. - I'm not gonna make a killing, Doug. If it was anything you could make some money on, I'd be sure and let you know. - Miss Chaney as I live and breathe. - What you workin' on? - Running a comparison for DiNapoli. He hit the jackpot. A perfect match. - The liquor store murders. - Mm-hm. - You see, that's patterns, that's what I'm talkin' about. That's what we keep looking for, you know? You get similar patterns, you get similar markings, you get similar M.Os, that's it. - You only had one single similarity to go on, just one. - We do. - You don't. We got that partial print back from the Bureau, negative. - That's not what I'm talkin' about. Our pattern in this one is that this is not your ordinary maniacal killer. This guy is deliberate and meticulous and that's our guy. - The perfect description of my mother, maniacal, deliberate, meticulous. - Okay, you get to question her. (phone rings) - Yeah, he's here. Higgins, it's for you, some woman named Swan. - [Clancy] Swan, Mrs. Swan. Wylie, I gotta go. - [Wylie] Will you hold on a second, please? - Oh, you better return this. It is curare, it's deadly, it could kill an elephant. - It's 100 years old. - 40 seconds and it stops your muscles moving. There's no antidote, it puts your heart to sleep. It's a lousy way to go. - You owe me 20 bucks. - Next pay check. Hey um, I thought we were gonna work together on this case. - We are working together on this. We agree to split the labors. You handle clues, I handle motives, right? She might have an important clue, she's a nice lady. Say hello to her, bye. - Yes. Oh, Mrs. Swan. Yes, I remember you. (suspenseful music) - Walt Miller here, I'm on 1-18 and I think there's something going on. I'm gonna go check it out. Listen, you call me on the phone in five minutes, got it? Okay. (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - [Clancy] Uh-huh, well those fool-proof safes. - Don't touch it. Lab guys haven't finished dusting for prints yet. - What's up? - I found these in the night-watchman's pocket. - [Clancy] So what? - So after talking to everybody around here I find that he doesn't smoke, and Dr. Burns here says that this place doesn't use this medical supply house. - Okay so we check the other doctors in the building to see if they do. Junkie, right? - Right. - [Clancy] How much stuff did he take, doctor? - Oh, some prescription blanks from my desk. Some morphine, a couple of mild barbiturates. Tranquilizers. - Let's have a look in there. Young guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - (sighs) Why here? - Right. Why did he come into this room? He could have left the other door, right. What's that? Doctor, could you answer a question for me? What's this? - This? This is a medical history record. - Yeah, that's what it says. I just happened to find it sitting in the machine there. I was just wondering if-- - Oh, really? I don't know what it was doing there, we don't copy these. These are confidential. We use that for billing. - You mean you didn't have this copy? - Oh no, certainly not. We only do that under extraordinary circumstances. - Doctor, could I borrow this for a couple of days? I'll bring it back. - Why don't you make a copy? - Right. We'll make a copy. - Hey. Hey, how you doin'? Take care of that for me. - That'll be a minute. - Alright. Some problem, man? - No problem at all. I just have to call over to the other store. We don't have that quantity, 500 tablets, on hand. It's no problem we'll have the other store just run it down. - No no, just get it, you know, my old lady's sick. You know, I want it for her, so just get it. - [Clerk] I understand, this kid on a bicycle runs it-- - What? No no, no bicycle, man, come on, bring it in a car. I can't wait, you know. - Right down by car. - She's sick, man. - I'll have to call. - My woman. Yeah, make the call. Make the call. - Hello, I have a narcotics emergency here. (mumbles) It's a man with a phony prescription. He's obviously under the influence. - [Clancy] It's weird about that doctor's office. Really weird. - Doctor's office? - Not the doctor's office but I mean, this junkie, right? Everything looks like a junkie but it's too pat. What junkie is so neat that there's no fingerprints? That place was broken into perfectly. I think the night-watchman was just a fluke. - Yeah and that photocopy has a lot of holes in it, too. - Yeah, listen, tomorrow morning, check out the guy whose name is on that photocopy. Maybe you can some find something for us. - Yeah. - Five-henry-seven. - Yeah, this is five-henry-seven, go ahead. - Proceed to pharmacy to (mumbles). May be related to your working 187. - 10-4. - Alright. I'll get us there in three minutes. - Everything alright? - Perfectly alright. Just be a few minutes. - I want this stuff and I want it over here now and quick. I can't wait, man, and she can't wait! Now you get it over here. - It's on its way, there's no need to excite yourself. - Hey man, I'm not excited, are you excited? - No, no. - I'm not excited, okay. Then just get it here, man. - It's coming down. - Okay well I don't have all night long to wait for this, man! So just get it here, I can't wait! - Now you won't have to. - Huh? Hey, hey! I'm cool, I'm cool. I'm cool, it's alright. Hey, I didn't do it, I didn't do it. I won't do it again. - Where'd you get the scripts? - Huh? - The scripts you brought into the drugstore! Where'd you get 'em? - Oh, I found them in an alley, in a garbage can. - Where? - Where, what, in an alley in a garbage can! - Come on, you can do better than that, man, think! - Yeah you better remember because somebody was killed taking those scripts and you're facing murder one. - Huh? Hey hey, look, I didn't kill anybody, man. I found those things. - Where? - I found them in a garbage can over behind that new medical building on California Street. - Who put 'em there? - I don't know, man, some dude. I know I'd never saw-- - What'd he look like? - I don't know, man, it was dark! And he ran down the alley, he had the pills and the prescriptions stuffed in a paper bag and he took the stuff and he's runnin', and he threw them in the garbage can. Then the guy got in the car and he drove away, that was all. - So what did he drive away in? - Huh? - What kind of car? - It was a Cadillac. It was a Cadillac, yeah, it was a Caddy. - What color was it? I gotta know. - A red, yeah a red, that's what it was. - I'm gonna make a phone call. This is five-henry-seven. I need a make on a young resident at County Hospital. Dr. Richard Walker. He's believed to be registered owner of a 1975 Cadillac Convertible, license number 4MS LEE. Got it? I need his address. I'll be in my truck. - Come on, let's hit it. (frantic piano music) - You'd think somebody would be home in a big building like this. - What do you wanna do? - That must be his place right there in the middle. Let's go in there. - Why don't we call the manager? I'm already in trouble. - To hell with it, we'll go in now while he's not home. The fire escape's chained, look, I know how to get in there. - You're crazy. - Come here. Just turn your back to me. Just turn your back to me like that. All I'm gonna do is step on your shoulder. - Not on this jacket you're not. - Alright, look. - [Wylie] Just pull the lever, and I'll catch you when it comes down. - Yeah okay, I can get up over here. Oh shit, it's him. (tires screech) - Stop right there or I'll blow your god damn head off! You stay there, too. - Can I help-- - Shut up! Now don't move or I'll shoot your friend in the head! Don't move. (muffled radio chatter) Are you a cop? (muffled radio chatter) Are you a cop? Man, I thought I blew my cover, stand up. Are you a cop? - Yeah, I'm a cop. - Well, so am I. - [Captain] How the hell did you and Wylie get in that situation? - Well I'll tell you this, that kid is a great undercover narc. He really had us fooled. When we threw Wylie up against that truck and the radio went on, I thought we were dead. - You know what, you might as well be dead for all the action we're getting in the heart case. And what the hell were you doing up there anyway? - We thought we had the killer at the doctor's office the other night. - Why are you bothering with that case? You know it's simple, it's a junkie. He'll lead himself right to us in time. You know what? You guys are really buggin' me. First your partner instigates a near-shootout with an innocent bystander, then the both of you come within a hair of gettin' your brains blown out by an undercover narc and god knows what else. You should be on the heart case only. Come on, I gotta go upstairs. - Olderman, we are on the heart case only, that's what I've been trying to tell you, the cases are related. And Wylie had some trouble with that guy, but he was no innocent bystander. That guy was withholding evidence and it took good police work to smoke him out. - Well you tell me how the cases are connected. - Alright, in a lot of ways. For example, that night-watchman. He had a pack of matches from a medical supply house. That doctor doesn't subscribe to it, neither does anybody else in that building. - He could have swiped the matches from the hospital. Junkies will steal anything, you know that. - Yeah well that's why I'm going up to that hospital to check it out. - Hey, you're under orders to stay away from that hospital and they come from upstairs. - Are you telling me the City Hall can come down here and interfere with what we do? Well do we go out and interfere with them? Yeah. (chuckles) Well screw 'em, I'm goin' out there. - Higgins. - Yeah. - Higgins, you'd better stay away! You're playing with a political football. - Yes, coach. Surprise. - How did you get in here? - Through the chimney. - Why all the pressure, doctor? What are you trying to hide here? - Get out of here. You can't just break into my office like this. Who do you think you are? - Don't get tough with me. Because I'm a cop and you're in trouble. You know what's gonna happen if you keep bullshittin' me? I'm gonna book you for murder! - Murder? You can't be serious! - I'm perfectly serious, I'm talkin' about four counts of suspected murder, doctor and I'm gonna put you so god damn far away that your friends in City Hall won't be able to find ya, much less help you! - Look, I'm sorry about the pressure, I, there's nothing going on here, I was only worried about the bad publicity. - Alright, you were worried about the bad publicity. You can stop worrying about the bad publicity, doctor. Are you ready to cooperate with me? - Yes, I am. - Alright, fine. You're gonna take me on a little tour of this hospital. You're gonna show me all the labs, all the operating rooms. I'm gonna meet all the doctors, I'm gonna meet all the technicians, I'm gonna know every single step and detail of every single transplant surgery you've ever done. Okay and the other thing I want, is I want one of your hospital paging devices. You know, it hangs on your belt, and I'm gonna get hooked up with you so the next time there's a donor, I wanna know, I wanna be hooked into the system, okay? Okay. (jaunty flute music) - (chuckles) That's cute. Here. You know, you look kinda cute today. - (coughs) Thank you, madam. - And you're drinkin' like a regular Irishman, too. - No, I'm drinkin' like a regular Frenchman. I'm drinkin' wine. - [Tiffany] Oh yeah. - That's what I really am, you know. - What do you mean? - My real parents were French. - You never told me that. - Did I never tell you that? Old man Higgins adopted me when their restaurant burned down on North Beach. - You know, I really like that, that's cute, you're a frog. (both laugh) - Well, I was raised Irish - Salut, Pierre. - Salut. - Chin chin. - Chin chin? - It's Italian. - It's Italian, alright. I hang around North Beach enough to be Italian. (pager rings) Oh, shit. - What? - Please call the hospital. - That's the hospital, I gotta go. - What do you mean it's the hospital? - I told you that's what I had this thing for, Tiffany. - Oh for Christ sake, Clancy, my god! - I'm sorry, it's business. I gotta go to the hospital, I'm sorry. - Clancy? - What? - Aren't you forgetting something? - [Clancy] Alright, alright, sorry. - Viola. - Oh my god, okay, bye bye. - Is that Frank? - I think it's his brother. - [Woman] What's going on here? - [Man] I don't know, he was into drugs for a while. - [Man] Yeah, I think he OD'd. - [Woman] Oh, drug abuse again? - [Man] I think so. (siren wails) (tires screech) (ominous music) - Higgins, come on! Higgins, you made it, good. This is a drug overdose with a donor card. I'll remove the heart is operating room A, while my team prepares the recipient in the adjacent O.R. You'd better get into greens and scrub up. (somber string music) - [Clancy] Can I take this off now? - Of course, there's no danger now. - Doctor, I owe you a couple of dozen apologies. I mean I had some funny ideas but anybody who can do what I just saw you do in there couldn't possibly be involved with the thing I'm investigating and I apologize. - It's all pretty straight-forward. - What an experience. - What I was worried about primarily was the bad publicity involved. You see, heart transplant surgery is still a very controversial subject. - Well I'll tell you what, if there's ever anything I can do for you, then don't hesitate to call on me or the department for that matter, I mean anything like that. - Well thank you very much, Inspector. I really appreciate that. - Where's that pain you told me about? - Down, more to the left. - In here? - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. Yeah. Okay, turn. You've been taking care of yourself, huh? (chuckles) - Saw your daughter yesterday, Frank. - Sylvia? - Mm-hm. - You know, she's been giving me a lot of static. Wonders why I have so many policemen for patients. Says I'm contributing to police brutality. (chuckles) - They're payin' their bills, aren't they? - Oh yeah, I'm not complaining. - Kids are the same all over. Mine don't like doctors. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Tom refers to the whole bunch as quack and fast-buck-guarders and times I may agree with him. - You know the first thing they teach us in medical school is how to shut up a patient with a thermometer. You know I found out last week you can take your temperature with those things? It's true. Well I suppose you're following that diet I gave you last year, aren't you? Uh-huh. - Mm-hm. - How about smoking? - Mm-hm. - Look, I can only tell you what to do. I can't do it for you. You know what will happen, don't you? (phone buzzes) Yes, Dr. Lang. Yes, he is. It's for you. - What? Where? Come on, fella, let's give us a break. Let us do some work. - Goodbye. - Come on, come on. Out. - Hey, come on! Same M.O.? (ominous music) - [Captain] But this one's a young one. Were you able to get a hold of Clancy? - Yeah, he should be here soon. - I hope the lab guys are through and the coroner's taken the body out before he comes. I can't stand another one of these scenes. (knocks) - Hey. - Yeah. Hi. - [Wylie] You eat dinner yet? - No, Tiffany was just putting it on the table, when I took your call. - Well maybe you still don't wanna look. - Maybe you'd better not, it's not necessary, we've seen it. You don't have to look, okay? - You're afraid I'm gonna puke, after what I saw this afternoon? Nothing could make me puke, I've got a cast-iron stomach. - Forget it, Clancy. You can look at the coroner's photographs. - Look, I don't like photographs, Olderman. I like the real thing. Oh, shit. - Hey, give him room. - Oh, Jesus! - What the hell's the matter? - Norton Williams took that heart out today. That was the operation I watched. - Get this done quickly. Have to tell the family. - Yeah. - You're right. That's incredible. - Yeah. - The records show an organ donation, but, that chest cavity is in intact. - Yeah, listen. Would you get a report about this to Olderman as soon as you can and don't tell anybody. Keep it quiet, alright? - Certainly. - Thank you. - Right, right. - The heart you took out was from the latest murder victim. - But that can't be, you were there. - Yeah, I was there and you were there, doctor, but it wasn't the same body, somebody switched those bodies and it has to be somebody who works in this hospital. - But how? - I don't know how. But I think I know why. (muffled radio chatter) - Hey, you better move that truck. You're not supposed to block the drive. - That's alright, I'll be gone before you guys are. Is Harvey around? - Yeah, he's in the office. - Harvey Nichols? - Yeah, come on in. - Hi. We talked for a few minutes the other day at the hospital. - Yeah, I remember. - My name is Clancy Higgins. I'm with Homicide. I wonder if I could talk to you for a few minutes. - [Harvey] Oh, have a seat. - I was there yesterday when you brought in a young girl for a heart donation, now look, Harvey, that room was rented to a young man named Will Malaly and it was him that the landlady called the police about. - You know, that is strange because I thought the landlady said there was a man up there, so when we got up there there was a woman and we found the donor's card and we had to get out real fast and I didn't give it a second thought. - Yeah, she said it took about 20 minutes. How come you got there before the police? - Oh, well we had a transfer in that neighborhood, and we got the call on the radio and we just zipped right on over. - Listen Harvey you're around that hospital quite a bit huh? - Oh, sure. - You know a lot of the doctors and the interns around there? Is there anybody around there who has been spending too much money lately, you know, they put on a big show. - No, not that I've noticed. - I wonder if you could do a favor for us. - Sure. - I'm gonna give you my card. And what I'd like you to do, wait, I got a card, wait a minute. What I'd like you to do is to watch out for anything kind of strange that happens around the hospital. Just if anybody seems to be spending a lot of money, that kind of thing. Could you do that? - Sure. - You can me on that number any time. You see, that girl you brought in wasn't a drug overdose. She was a murder victim, so this is pretty important. We're very interested in this. - Yeah, sure, I mean, anything I can do. - I'd appreciate it, thanks a lot. (phone rings) - Clancy, glad you called. Hey, things are really breakin' loose. The coroner went back over the reports and found in every case there was some kind of needle mark which could have been the results of a blood sample. - Jesus Christ, Duke Miller said something about a puncture wound, right? You see it's so damn simple. It was there in the reports all the time. - Yeah I know it seems obvious. We should have made the connection. Jamie. Yeah, they just came in. They don't look too extensive, so hold on, and I'll see what they tell us. Jackpot! All the victims reported being mugged only a few days before they were murdered. All incidents were noted on the computer as random street crimes. - Random my ass. Listen, Wylie, check with Dr. Burns. See if any of our victims were ever her patients. - Is this all he gave you? - That's all he gave me. - Okay. Thanks, Al, huh? Clancy. Yeah I just got a report from Mike Servantes. You know the guy whose name was on the photocopy, Tom Moore, well he was mugged last night. - Ah-ha, you see? Alright, where is he? - He's in St. John's Hospital. - Okay. Hello, sister. Tom Moore? Hi. My name is Clancy Higgins. I'm an inspector with Homicide. How you doin', Tom? - Well, I'm having a hard time getting a job and I really-- - How do you feel right now? - I feel real shaky. - Yeah. Tell me about the mugging, how it happened. - I'm walkin' through Valencia Park last night, late. Some guys comes, hits me in the back of the head, knocks me down, breaks my only pair of glasses. Next thing I remember I wake up in an ambulance. - [Clancy] Mm, he get your money? - I don't have much money. I don't know why he'd do it for that. - I don't think he was after your money, Tom. I think he was after your blood. Can I see your arms? I don't think you're a junkie, Tom, don't worry. I just wanna check something. There it is. - What? - See that? Somebody took a blood sample out of you and it wasn't the hospital, Tom. Tommy, I don't wanna scare you, but I'm gonna have to. You read about the heart murders, right? - Yeah, sure. - Well, each one of those victims, just before they disappeared, was mugged, and each one of them had a blood sample taken. We think you're next on the list, Tom. (suspenseful music) - Mike Servantes said to give you this. He said it's important. - Can you hold on a sec? - Yeah. - Yeah, can you patch me through to five-henry-seven? - [Radio] Five-henry-seven, a telephone interconnect. Go ahead. - This is five-henry-seven. Go ahead, Wylie. - Clancy, Dr. Williams just gave me the names of three patients whose blood type could possibly be tissue matches with Moore's and one of them really sticks out. - Hey, Wyle? - Hold on a sec. - Here's the information you wanted. - Thanks, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, here's our guy. Gregory, 7783 Steiner Street, you got that? Okay I'll see you there. (somber string music) - Okay. - Can you tell us who the man was who contacted you? - No, I can't. He uh, called over the phone twice, and I had a meeting with him on California Street in an apartment building-- - What apartment building? - 1173 California. - [Clancy] Now what do you mean you had a meeting with him? - [Leigh] Well I talked to him from outside the building through the intercom. - There must have been a buzzer number. There must have been a number on the room. - Yes. 3B. - [Clancy] He either stole a passkey or he's just good with locks. - Yeah, right. - Well look, call this Mrs. Davis in New York. - Mrs. Davis? - There it is, yeah. See if she's got any relatives out here who might be using the place but that's ridiculous. Also, get the lab up there for dusting but you know damn well that son of a bitch is too slick for that. - Alright, so what's the next move, huh? - Well. We know he wants Moore. So we do a little trolling with Moore, that's all. We'll put Moore out and tail him. - Do you think it's safe for us to tail him? I mean we've been hanging around that hospital a long time. - Yeah you're right, Wylie. We'll put DiNapoli and Brewer on it. I'm gonna get this son of a bitch if it kills me. - [Weatherman] 37 degrees and cloudy, San Francisco. This is KEST. - Aw Moore, come on, look he's goin' shoppin' again. - I know, the guy's making a hobby out of this thing. - Three times this week. - Pain in the ass. - [DiNapoli] You know, my wife and I figured out, you should always keep your shopping down to one day a week. That way you save money, you make a list and you stick to it and you don't, you know-- - You figured that out, huh? - Hold on. - Yeah, gotta hold on. Wait a minute, I gotta back up. Just a second. Keep an eye on him. - So wait a second, I'll tell you what. Why don't I just go in and, uh... - No, wait a minute, I gotta go in-- - I gotta go in and shop okay? - Shop? - [DiNapoli] My wife forgot a couple of things. - You just gave me the lecture about-- - [DiNapoli] I know, I know, just don't worry about it. (suspenseful music) (Tom whistles jauntily) - [Man] Don't say anything or you're dead. Just turn around and take my cart and start walkin'. - [Wylie] You know we should have covered that tail ourselves. - [Officer] Hi, Clance. - At least we know the ball's in his court. It's his move now, he's gotta make the next move. - Oh, so now he gets to kill the guy. - Look, I... He's not gonna kill Moore, until he gets another body to substitute. As long as we're hooked into the hospital network, then we'll get to the accident first, right? - No way, we can't cover that much territory. - Listen, Wylie. Have you seen my wallet around? - Your shield. - I lost my shield. (Wylie sighs) - You lost your shield again. - I mislaid my wallet again, right. - You seem to be losing a lot of things these days. You know what I mean? - One of these days I'm gonna lose you, partner. I'll be in the truck. (muffled radio chatter) (truck approaches) - Hey, did you hear anything? - Yeah, it sounded like somebody pulled into the drive. I'll take a look. It's that cop Higgins. - Okay, relax. Look, I'll handle everything. You go outside and stall him for a minute. I wanna make sure our friend keeps quiet. Hey and remember, none of your shenanigans. - How you doin', Harvey? - Well Officer Clancy, what brings you to my humble establishment on this fine day? - I'm not really Irish, listen, last time I was here, I took my wallet out and I haven't seen it since. Did you see a wallet around? - No, I haven't, what about you? - Yeah, I thought you guys might have picked it up and just thrown it ina drawer or somethin' not knowin' what it was. - Well, we did a little bit of cleaning up this morning, but we didn't find anything. - This thing ain't too comfortable, is it? - Well it's like any mattress, the firmer the better. - Yeah. I'm always losin' these damn things. (suspenseful music) Hey, can I have a cookie? Thanks. Oatmeal, huh? Pretty good. - Look, if we find your wallet, we'll certainly give you a call. - Yeah. Listen, you haven't seen anything around the hospital? - No. - I got a couple more stops to make in this wallet trail. I'll see you, Harvey. See you, uh, Jamie. - Take care, Clancy. Well, he's gone. - Hey, you believe that story? He's onto somethin'. And maybe we ought to back off for a while, at least until the heat's off. - No way. I want one more. That makes it an even million dollars. And when the time is right, we make our move. - I don't like it. - Look, there is no way out. You wanted out before we grabbed the last one and I got that one through, didn't I? - Yeah but we didn't have that cop nosin' around here, not with that phony wallet story. Hey, how come you didn't give it back? - You never know when a badge might come in handy. - You know, I can't believe there hasn't been a traffic fatality in the last 24 hours. - Aw Jesus, what kind of a trap is this we got anyway? We gotta wait for the bait to walk into it. Hey. We don't have to wait for the bait. Look, if you want a bear-- - You set a bear trap. - We can have a bear trap in the morning. (siren wails) Where's Tom Moore? - What? - Where's Tom? Hey! (suspenseful music) Look for Tom Moore, he might be still alive. (muffled shouting) - You have the right to remain silent! - He killed the night-watchman! - Alright, I want you girls outta here. I want you outta here. Just get out before you get hurt. Come on, walk. Just keep walkin'. Girls! (gun fires) (gun fires) (suspenseful string music) (music intensifies and swells) (Harvey groans) - [Wylie] Clancy! Where are ya? Clancy! - [Clancy] Over here! Wylie! - Clancy! Where are ya? Where have you been? - Where have I been? - Are you alright? - Yeah it's alright, he winged me. Listen, you better get a medic over here. I hit him with a curare. - Get a medic over here, now! - What about Tom Moore, did you find him? - He was inside the gurney. - Inside the gurney? - [Wylie] Underneath the gurney in a cut-out piece of foam. - [Clancy] Is he alive? - [Wylie] Alive. Doctor said he's gonna be fine. - Jesus Christ, what a day. - [Wylie] And you got him with the dart? - Yeah. - God, you're tough. (chuckles) - You owe me $20. - Come on, let's get you cleaned up. (moody orchestral music)
