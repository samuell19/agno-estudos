The song These are song from Bangladesh . Lots & lots of Bangladesis are entering here like group of grasshoppers . These songs are also coming along with them. One could say like Milton! Is Neelkantha is on the way to ... But the man who has been trying for this reunion for 30 years ,he is now drowned in the sea of alcohol . He is a worthless man! He talks off artistic intigrity, and look what he does! What? That man... what? That car. That car belongs to one of my old friend .

There will be a huge compitition because there are many other knowledgeable person who are existing in this line. I had to be a commercial artist after passing finance I became out of touch otherwise, I would have dreamt something like Picaso.

Scotch I won't have this... liver will burst Why suddenly?. I just recollected the play you wrote in 1952 No before that Early in 1948 you wrote play & started to talk about the reunion of the culture of 2 Bengals.

Well then let me gather some courage. Mother you must give a bit of support in this case. Let me plan Let's proceed. Dad ! You had been lamenting over the fact that you don't have a girl. Here is a girl for you. She is ready to help you in all household matter. What is the meaning of all these? Nothing . It is very simple I have come to stay here . I am a changed person I have transformed my character . I will get hold of a job. Once I passed M.A. didn't I ? Once upon a time I had the habit of teaching students. There is record still now She is the spirit of Bengal. She is driven away from Bangladesh Her father is a bankrupt. She don't know anyone here and was roaming alone in the roads. I can't leave her alone . So I brought her with me. Good. Will you now take yourself out ? Bring him back . he is mad. Come here , Where are you going ? You are making fun?

Bring him back I will The Drama of Mother & daughter is completed? Can I request you something? What? Before entering here I saw a beautiful forest nearby. Not even half a mile away. So what happened? I am tired. Really tired. As you know Durga - I don't get tired easily. But today my mind is very tired. I know your capability in making sentences You can't distract me by saying all these words. You are making poem. If you are really tired then search for a shelter & stay there. Yes . I will spend the whole night in that forest. Then after that there lies a huge. But still I will say I will not rest Then don't rest Durga, can you do me a favor? What do you want? Can you come to the forest tomorrow with some foods. I want to set off very early tomorrow morning. Let's see One more thing What else? Bring Satya with you tomorrow morning Why?. I want to see his face at dawn when the first sunrays will fall on his face. I will carry that picture with me in my heart. Oh. God! It can't carry on like this. There is no future of own relation. I have to do something. I must analyse a scientific reason for the history of Bengal what are the achievements from the struggle for freedom ? What have independence given us ? They might be agents . We have to extract information from them. Brother Oh . this is a drunkard. Who are you ? As the child said - a drunkard Leave all that . Who are you? I am burning . Universe is burning. Every thing is burning I am a humbug But still I am everything I will put one through your head Oh ! I am a broken intellectual Broken intellectual. According to your language , I am a representative of the past, totally broken & eroded society. Name- Nilkantha Bagchi Kishor what is the matter? Who is this ? He is a quiet well known man He has no politics You don't matter. You can go But I want to stay. I want to know what lively force is driving you. But we are expecting attack at any moment. But still I want to be here. Nothing is left there in thisBangladesh Every thing depends on you. Then stay with us. Can I get on with it ? Yes you can get on with it & die. Yes, I am on the same way. Can I say you something? Yes. Why do you drink so much ? No reason behind this. People like you should understand We, our generation is like radarless ship No one is original . You people are the cream of Bengal. If you think so then ... Stop As you listen to your leaders who guides you in every aspect, you also listen to me a bit and then speak. But everyone wait I have no doubt on your courage and devotion But you people are totally misguided. Like boys of you have succeeded and failed at the same time.You are stubborn & blind. Don't speak nonsense. Have you studied anything?. Red book, CPC Report, The diary of Guevara, have your read all those? Inspite of not following those why you... As you are not belongs to them...otherwise. O.K. let me take out my bottle. Before proceeding further let us start from the basic thing. How many edition of "Deshabali' have you studied ? Red flag ? 0.K.! O.K.! Pause for a while guided by dialectical and historical mechanism. Marxism is very much Comrade Lenin applied Marxism scientifically & told that temporarism is a morribund state of capitalism. Dam say all these old dialogues 0.K. I don't want to break into your patience But it gave birth to burocratic socialism Comrade Mao united all famous of China and took them towards a revolution . But this is not end here. Gueavara came he tried to bring in a change with help of students, intellectuals & famous. The others I have forgotten. ...May be said as per lelin ??? ...infantile disorder It seems like this. 0.K. you are right. Do you agree with that? Yes I agreed to the statement given by your ancestors. Yes you really are the rotten drunkard representative of intellectual people of your age Right let me have a bit of ... When I have started let me complete it Look son! India consists of you . The history of India dates back to thousand of years . India has adopted these days of glory for some days. This country has handled arms to many naughty people .These naughty people has to be removed from the root They won't go unless we force them To remove them we have to know their strength & weak point Under stood. Can you do that? . No that is why I drink so much. It is not possible for me to stand for so long with gun in hand . I can lie or steal money for drinking . But I won't say single lie for fame, for getting any position or to kill people .. This is a good dialogue. How many times have you used it for extracting money for drinking . Ultimately you understood... I will tell you a truth. I am confused . All of us are utterly confused. We are fathoming in the darkness, not knowing which way to go. Life is the property of alive! Unstoppable Durga Everything is burning. The universe is burning I am burning . Do you remember the story of Manikbabu's There he mentioned... I won't weave clothes with your money ...remember those words? Gets rheumatism for long gap in operating weaving machine. I have to do something. Something must have to be done. Softly...
