Why make a big deal out of it? Hua talked to me, he hopes that we could let his nephew go. I didn't promise him anything, and brought this to your attention right away. He's obstructing justice, come with me to the Crime Squad to take a statement. He's Amy's boyfriend, works at the control room. I'll take care of Amy's funeral arrangements.

I just want to tell you that I had a good record, until your complaint. I've lost my pension and provident fund because of you. Change into a large one. Come in. What is it, Chief? How did you write the report? I did it as you told the other day. There's so much you could do, but you had to deal with that Xiaoli. I was trying to save him. You think you are a saviour?

The bullet entered the skull, it's lodged in here. This one is clearer. Sir. How's he? He got shot in the head, and is in brain surgery now. The bullet is inside his skull, he's in surgery. We're not sure about what happened. Doctor, how did it go? It went fairly well, the patient's stabilised. But it's still critical, he will be sent to the ICU for observation. He's very lucky. The bullet entered the forehead, it traveled through the nerves in between the eyes, and then it shot through the sinus, upper and lower jaws, and the tongue. The bullet stopped at the lower jaw. His brain isn't damaged too much. You could say it's a miracle. What now? You wet your bed again? Why don't you ask for a bedpan? So annoying! Don't move. What? If you continue, I won't clean up for you. Stop moving. Let me. Who are you? I'm his wife. Sorry about it. I'll be back later to take his blood pressure, we're already busy as it is, and he's not our only patient. The true facts behind the detective getting shot These are tabloids, no one will believe them. The doctor said I can recover soon, I can go back the way I was. Great! When can I go back to work? Your health is our priority. Get some rest. I'm off. Bye, Mrs. Liu. Bye. You don't have to do this. You're pitying me, right? Leave. Why is he like that? Thanks. The bullet went through his sinus and tongue, his sense of taste and smell have been marred. that's why he couldn't smell or taste. Will that change? Very hard. Thanks. My lawyer has taken care of your immigration application to Canada. Under these circumstances, how can I leave him? You're reluctant to put him behind? It's not that. You pity him? Don't know. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I've no idea. I'll take care of you. I can assure you a happy life. Don't do this because of the baby, this isn't your responsibility. I know.

This report was sent from the medical. It says that Liu Zhenhai has recovered, he can go back to work anytime. The whole department feels embarrassed about the whole incident. According to his report, he received a source, and went there to investigate. The tabloids made up those stories. Then tell him to come back to work next week.

Three paramedics were killed, they could be strangled to death. The suspect is still at large. This is the nasal cartilage, there's an opening here. When you had the operation, we expected that it would heal, but from the way it looks, that's unlikely. That's why the liquid inside your brain would... Sorry? The liquid inside your brain leaks from this opening, and it causes dizziness and spasms. What else do I have? Can you tell me once and for all? You were in critical condition at that moment. All we tried to do was to save you. But you need a second operation, to stitch up the opening. Or it would be dangerous if the germs enter the brain. So my brain's leaking? You could say so. Crap!
