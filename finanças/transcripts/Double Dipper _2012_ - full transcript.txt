Oh, no Mabel. I... I don't feel so good! I... Bleechhh! Ohh! Grunkle Stan, what did you feed us? Bwahhhh! Barfy! Guys, stop! Something terrible just happened! Comedy gold! All right, all right! Party supplies are now off-limits. Mr. Pines, whose birthday is it again? Nobody's. Thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the shack. Nice! The young people of this town want fun, I'll smother 'em with fun! Maybe comments like that are why kids don't come to the mystery shack. Hey! Hey! How's about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers? Oh, boy! A trip to the copier store! Calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more! They got it all at the copier store. That's not their slogan, I just really feel that way about the copier store. Save the trouble. You know the old copier in my office? I finally fixed the old girl up. Good as new! Butterflies! Does it even work? Uhh! Success! Aah! Aaah! Aaah! Stay back! Oh, my gosh. Mabel, I think this copier can copy human beings! Do you realize what this means? All right, party people, and Dipper, let's talk business. Soos, because you'll work for free... and you begged... I'm letting you be D.J. You won't regret it, Mr. Pines. I got this book that teached me how to D.J. R-r-r-right. Not encouraging. Wendy, you and Mabel are working the ticket stand. What?! But Grunkle Stan, this party is my chance to make new friends! I-I could work with Wendy. You realize if you do, you gotta commit to staying at the ticket stand with Wendy. No getting out of it, just the two of you, alone, all night. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I promise. Aah! What? Uh, uh, I can work the counter with you, Wendy! Let's kiss! Mmm... Mmm... Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want, but I have devised a plan to make sure my night with Wendy goes perfect. Plan? Oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you? Overcomplicated? Let me just... all right, hold that there... okay... "Step one: Getting to know each other with playful banter." Banter is like talking, but smarter. That sounds like a dumb idea for poop-heads. Yeah, see, this isn't banter. This is what I want to avoid with Wendy. The final step is to ask her to dance. Oh, Dipper! I'm so happy you decided to work the ticket stand with me! You're so organized. Show me that checklist again? Oh! If I follow steps one through eleven, nothing can get in my way. Dippeyou're the one getting in your way. Why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person? Step nine, sister... Can your uncle throw a party or what? The energy... it's electric! Uh, lightning. Lightning... And if anyone wants to leave, I'm charging an exit fee of 15 bucks! I've only got 13! We're trapped! "Step one: Casual banter." So, here's a casual question. What's your favorite type of snack food? Oh, man. I can't just pick one. No way! Mine too! Wait. What? Uh, I mean... I mean... New topic! New topic! Go! Go! Work it! Work it! Wow! You've got an animal on your body! I'm Mabel. Hi. I'm grenda. This is candy. Why do you have forks taped to your fingers? Improvement of human being. I've found my people. Remember, dudes, whoever, um, party hearties... what?... gets the party crown! Most applause at the end of the night wins! Whoa! Wow! Party crown? I'll take that. Thank you very much. Who's that? The most popular girl in town: Pacifica northwest. I always feel bad about myself around her. I can't just give you the crown. It's sort of a competition thing. Honestly, who's gonna compete againme? Fork girl? Lizard lady? Hold me, candy! Our kind isn't welcome here! Hey! I'll compete! I'm Mabel. That sounds like a fat old lady's name. I'll take that as a compliment. May the better partier win. Nice meeting you! She's going down. Whoa! Sounds like the party's gettin' nuts! Let the battle for the party crown begin! Mabel comes out strong. Watch out, pacifica! I've gotta get in there! Cover for me? Heh heh. Um, well, I... thanks, man. I'll be back shortly! I'm sure Stan won't mind if I'm gone for a few minutes. Hey! What are you doin', kid?! These suckers aren't going to rip themselvoff. Yeah! You promised. Remember? I did? Dippe I promise. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Argh. If only I could be two places at once. I wonder if this is a good idea. Whoa! I have a really big head. Ha! Sorry. Ha! Sorry. You first. You first. Stop copying me! Stop copying me! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Aah! Ow! Ow! Funny bone. I will call you "number two." Definitely not. You know a name I've always wanted... Tyrone. Tyrone. Okay, Tyrone, let's get down to business. I'm thinkin' you cover me at the ticket stand while I ask Wendy to dance. I know the plan, buddy. Hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we? Dipper, please. This is you you're talking about. Plus, hey, you can always just disintegrate me with water. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Whew. Great news, Wendy. I got somebody to cover the concessions for me. That's awesome! You can hang out with me and Robbie. Robbie, you remember Dipper from the convenience store. Uh, no. Yo, Wendy, check out my new guitar. Whoa, cool. Robbie, you're a stupid, arrogant fraud, but kiss me anyway because you can play guitar. Oh, wait. I forgot something. Ohh... Let's get married tonight! Hey, buddy, it's me. You. I just had the same jealousy fantasy. We gotta get rid of Robbie if I ever want to dance with Wendy! Hey, Dipper! We're gonna go sit on the couch. Meet us when you're done. Oh, no! They're sitting on the couch! We gotta think of something quick! I got an idea. I got the same one. But we're gonna need some help. And that's where you come in, number three. But what if Robbie catches me? I'll be all alone. Okay, one more clone. Makes a good point. Four dippers. This is a four-Dipper plan. Uh-oh, paper jam. Aah! Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi! Come on, you're not gonna make me partner up wihim, are you? Shh! Don't be rude. Hey, buddy, hey. It's okay. Okay, just one more clone. ♪ ...me is forever ♪ ♪ Always ♪ ♪ Forever ♪ I used to sing like that... Before my voice changed. Pacifica pulls ahead! Try and top that. Oh, grenda? By the way, you sound like a professional wrestler. Ha ha ha ha! I wanna put her in a headlock and make her feel pain! It's not over till it's over, sisters! Watch this! Soos! Give me the eighties's crowd-pleasingest, rock balladiest song you got! Excellent. ♪ Don't start un-believing ♪ ♪ Never don't not feel your feelings ♪ Now I'm gonna do a flip! That was for you guys!!! Dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside? It is being stolen right now. Wait... what?! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey! Come back here! Oh, tough break. I wonder who those guys are that aren't me because I'm right here? Now we're gonna bring it down for a minute. Ladies, dudes, now's the time. Ah, snap! Love this song! Hey, goofus! Now's your chance to ask Wendy... now's your chance to ask Wendy to dance! Come on! Go! I... ahh... Uhh-uhh-uhh... Aah! I'll be right back. Oh, I agree. You can't just go and danwith her. The dance floor is a mine field! A mine field, Tyrone! What if there's a glitch in the sound system! Stan might get in the way! Robbie might come back! There's too many variables! We need help. All right, dippers, gather round. Now's the time. You all clear on what to do? Hey, Soos, look! A glowing dot! Oh, man, I am so glad I turned my head. That dot does not disappoint. Right. Like I'm gonna fall for that. Aaah! Gimme that money, Sonny! There's your cue. It's the perfect moment to ask Wendy to dance. Good luck, me. I don't need luck. I have a plan. Aaah! Oh, hey, man, what's up? W-what are you doing here? I mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor, uh, in, like, exactly 42 seconds? I'm just waiting for the bathroom. Um, um, okay. Uh, small talk, small talk, small talk... So, hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island. Who do you think the leader would be? I...Uh... I think I'd go with this lunatic. I'd probably go for stretch over there. Uh, because tall people can reach coconuts? Speaking of tall, want to see something? Those are my three brothers, and I'm... Boop! Ha! You were a freak! Yep. You know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before I started hiding it all the time. Birthmark? Uh, no, it's nothing! I-I... why did I say that?! No way, dude. Now you have to show me. Show me, show me! The big Dipper! That's how you got your nickname! I thought your parents just hated you or something. Hey, I guess we're both freaks. Wait here? Of course! Hey! What are you doing up here?! Number ten had been distracting Soos for 15 minutes! He's gonna get tired of that dot eventually. Never! You won't believe it, guys. I bumped into Wendy accidentally and things are actually going great! That's nice, but not the plan. Do we have to remind you? Oh, man, you guys sound crazy. Look, maybe we don't need the plan anymore, ya know? Maybe I could just go talk to her like a normal person. You bite your tongue! If you're not gonna stick to the plan, maybe you shouldn't be the Dipper to dance with Wendy. If you think about it... Guys, come on. We said we weren't gonna turn on each other. I think we all knew we were lying. No! No! Hey! Uhh! No, wait! Aaah! I can't breathe in here! Yeah, you can! Plus there's snacks and a coloring book in there for you! Ohh! Okay, so now that original Dipper... or "Dipper Classic"... is no longer fit for it, I nominate myself to dance with Wendy instead. I've been around the longest, so it should be me. Right? I mean, logically. Logically, guys. Fair point, fair point. Maybeshould get to dance with Wendy because I've been around for the least. That makes, like, zero sense. You make zero sense! Watch it! Don't shove people! Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi! Aaaah! Hey, you want some cheese and crackers, buddy? Huh? Huh? Yikes. Hey, guys? What would you do if you were trapped in a closet? Break out. Wend... Come on, man, give it up. You're overpowered. Hold on, guys, think about it. We're exact equals mentally and physically. If we start fighting, it'll just go on for infinity! That's true. Maybe we should just give up... Aaah! Clone fight!!! Quit hitting myself! Quit hitting myself! Aaah! Guys, come on, it's me! Hey, you! Get off! Hey! Classic Dipper's getting away! No, friends. It's me. Number seven. That's not me, guys, that's not me! Get him! Stay back, stay back... Boo! Lame. Lame. Huh. How 'bout that? You! Uh-oh. One more song, dudes, and then it's time for the bestowing of the party crown! It's gonna be the... Nailed it. Pacifica, I just want to say that whoever wins, it's been a super-fun party. Aww. It thinks it's gonna win. Hey, did you hear that? People clapping for the weird girls? Yeah. Me neither. Say it! Say I can dance with Wendy! Never! Wendy? Wendy? Robbie! Shut up. Ohh. We blew it, man. Ohh. We blew it, man. I don't know. You wanna go grab a couple sodas or something? Let the party crown voting commence! Good luck, Mabel. Applaud to vote for Mabel! Yeah! Go, Mabel! Let's check the applause-o-meter. Oh... Oh... Pretty good... And your next contestant, pacifica! Uh-oh! A tie! This has, like, never happened before. Ladies and gentlemen, we... we have a winner. The winner of the contest is pacifica northwest. Thank you, Jorge. Thank you, everyone! Everyone come to the after-party at my parents' boat! Whoo-hoo! Pacifica! Pacifica! Pacifica... Ohh. Sorry I let you guys down. I understand if you want to leave. But then we would Miss the sleep-over. The what? We want to call our moms and sleep over here with you! You're like a total rock star! I have magazine boys. Really? You guys! Maybe we don't have as many friends as pacifica, but we have each other, and that is pretty good, I think. Soos! Play another song! This thing's going all night! Way head of you, hambone. Some night, huh? Ahh. You think we really even have a chance with Wendy? I mean, she's 15, we're 12. I don't know, man. I hope so. But we're making zero progress the way we're doing it. The only good conversation you had with her was when you didn't do any of that list stuff. I know. Mabel was right, I do get in my own way. Literally! Literally! Whoa... Oh, boy, don't look now. Tyrone! It's okay, dude, I had a good run. Remember what we talked about. Uh, of course! Hey, and quit being such a wimp around Wendy, okay? For my sake!!!! Tyrone! You were the only one who understood. Ha ha ha! Dipper! Where have you been? Meet my girlfriends! Yeah-uh! Found it.
