CLOUDY CLOUDS What are you doing here? - I buzzed, but the back door was open. - Oh, you're Paul? Here's the situation. I don't like leaving my mom alone for too long. At some point I have to go out, but... I'm very attached to her. Your mother is very nice. Would you like to stay for a cup of tea? I have a big exam next week. Oh. Oh, right, your money. Wait a moment. - I have to... - No, it's okay. Do you play piano? - Unfortunately not. - It's just that... You remind me of someone. Oyster omelet. Regina had this recently. - Harbor City in Hamburg! - Yuck! Wow, this is a special meal. No. It's what we're having at Regina's tomorrow. Lay out your jacket for me, Per-Ulrich. You know she'll talk about us later. The blue one? It's full of patches. There's no point. Silas, what are you doing? Welcome to the 21st century! "Anonymous danger. Unknown stone throwers in our midst. Yet again, police are investigating dangerous behavior on the road. - A driver was targeted last night..." - Oh, no, not again! "'We're sure those responsible are in the area, ' said police spokesman Netzer. The exact whereabouts and identity of the suspects are unknown. - Local government..." - I can't take this anymore! You're so annoying. Paul, where were you last night? We wanted to work on your applications. You weren't sure about the deadline. Jena is supposed to be very nice. Per-Ulrich? That's what I've read anyway. Galeen had to depart from Stoker's model. The film benefitted. Plot, dialogue, and visuals combine to form a unit full of poetry and rhythm. You can read about it in Eisner's studies. So, that's the introduction. By the end of "Literature and Image" you will have finished a creative project on a topic of your choice. Dala? - Dalalalala... - In parallel, you can write a paper... Why are you here anyway? Sorry, Bulwer, but look at the time. It's our last class. We're all hungry. My mom can't wait for me to get home. "Fitness?" "Preventive Athletic Training?" Hm? "Species-Appropriate Animal Keeping." Were the other courses full, Max? Don't you fancy singing in a choir, hm? And what if I don't? Will you spy on me again? Do you want something from me? I want you to finish your final project. I want you to pass. And then I want you to go away. Will you come to me in my dreams from time to time? I'll welcome you with outstretched arms and kiss your breath away. You'll take me over like an heir moving back into his deserted palace. Gates and doors ﬂy open with unseen hands and down below in the park the fountain begins to splash happily. - Max missed his cue. - I uh... You just moved so weird. - You distracted me. Not in a bad way... - How about you learn your lines? This is your version of Wedekind, but you're acting like it's Schiller. Treat the stage as the perfect place to loosen up. We'll have to do more exercises to help you let go. Can you even hear me back there? No, you can't. - Priority number one: learn your lines. - Learn your lines. - Aren't you satisfied? - That's not it. It's just... I was expecting something different. - I don't know. - Hey! Hey, Dala! Then regularly starting next week. Okay. - Hey! - Falk. - Per, right? - Paul. Paul, that's right. - Per's your dad. - Per-Ulrich. Right, Per. So, back at the gym again? - You're here a lot. - Yeah. And always in your street clothes. My parents want me to cover our fees, so I help out sometimes. - Uh-huh. - The membership fee is really steep. - There's a barbecue on Friday. - I've got to go. We've got outdoor activities next weekend. Hiking, kayaking. And I'm in charge. What do you say? Come on. Just write down your details. And on Saturday you'll be sitting right in the kayak. Hey! Niels, what are you doing? Concentrate! Do it cleanly, man! Niels! Another two circuits, everyone! And run, run, run! Nice, Kevin! Fitness for power! Concentrate! Just like that. Yes, nice. Nice, Daniel. Extend as far as you can go. Right. What's your problem? Unbelievable. Look away, man! It's a stuffy dump. But my mom developed a provincial fetish after her last relationship ended. I can't believe you work here. I'm saving up for after graduation. I want to maintain my weight. ls there a good photographer around here? We have a project at school. I'm supposed to finish school here. But I've only been there twice. Shit, man, I need to exercise. But not in this old man's club. With its outdoor activities and... barbecues. I'm David, by the way. And what can I call you? Voyeur? Hey, hold up. Show me around. I have to get to know the area if I'm going to live here. Want to be my tour guide? Did you spend the whole day in your room? Pretty much. We'll be in touch. Try not to worry too much. We'll get this straightened out. Okay? We'll call you, okay? Thank you for coming. - Get home safely, Ms. Schatterhain. - Thank you. Sorry. - Paul? Hello. - Mr. Kupferschlag. It was too bad I couldn't make it to your dad's celebration. Your stepmother throws such nice parties. How was it? - Cozy. - Yeah. How are you doing, young man? Things aren't easy right now. That was Ms. Schatterhain. Her son goes to school here. Poor woman. Her son has been missing for quite some time now. Take good care of yourself, young man. How could this be turned into a concept for your project? Thoughts? Oh, my. Let's see then... At night you listen through the window To the familiar rustling of tall trees Raindrops ticking in time The yam strengthens your back Meditatively spun Warming... thousands of stitches lily white It turns softly in the twilight until You, clear and pointy... short, thorny You see me in a dream As a crustacean under my bed Eyes keeping a lookout on the water Tense limbs in the web Paul, I'd like to see you after school. You can go now. This is where you're hiding. You like being outside? I think you're doing great in Bulwer's class. No joke. Everyone's terrified of his criticism, but... you did well. I think it's interesting. With that poem and everything... I don't know. I never noticed you before Bulwer. I mean, German must be one of your main subjects. Good you mention it. I have Schneider. She kills people who come late. But thanks for the nice chat. The biggest collection in the region. And everyone's fascinated by the fawn. But each piece is essential. Apropos of degeneration. What do you think of the curriculum? Your class is so different. Too bad you didn't take biology with me. You'd have learned something substantial. Does "Hydra vulgaris" mean anything to you? A freshwater polyp. Nearly transparent. Look. Just like that, every sign of independent life is gone. Brutal, isn't it? We could do so much if only we were allowed. An aroused state in connection with nature... spawns all art. This area... The forests, the abandoned villages... All it takes is the right person... as the link. But our school curriculum... is a sleeping pill. I'd really like to hear your ideas for the project. You know where I live? Are you already home, Per-Ulrich? Ow! Paul, I thought you were your father. Paul? Let me help you with your pants, okay? Paul! Demanding. Artsy. Anorexic. - Sullen. - Wannabe. - Screwed up. - Hot. - Meanie. - Thanks, that's enough. Thanks, Dala. You've got it now, right? I'd like to have one of the boys. Max. Come on up. Okay. - Like this? - No. I mean... - Should I sit? - It doesn't matter. Then I'll sit down. Just be yourself. - Dumb. - Fuck you. - Clueless. - Clueless but sweet. - Fit. - Bah, poser! You don't get it. Get down. Max! Hello. Someone else, please. Who hasn't gone yet? - What about you? I can't recall your name. - Paul! Sorry. Paul. Would you like to? Come on up. Not so shy now. Go ahead. Stay focused here, too. This kind of work requires effort. Okay? Good. I'll show you again. You are... neutr... No! Yes. It's hard for me to always get into character. The others don't care as much. I don't think. But... I don't care what the others think. You don't care? As a kid, when my mom was gone, I always sat in front of her mirror. Not to be pretty but... to play a Pa"- And you? - What do you mean? - \/\/hen you were alone? When I was alone? I always tried not to look in the mirror. And when I did, then... I didn't breathe. I thought it was cool that you came today. Dala? Dalalalala! Hey, we're all heading over to the youth club. - Want to come? - Uh... yeah. Why not? But... - No need to come if you don't want to. - I do. Okay. Cool. See you soon. No booze here! Bitch. Listen, little man. I don't like hanging out here either. Man, that girl! She drives me crazy. Don't tell anyone, but I only took drama to be with her. And that asshole Bulwer's class, too. At night in bed I imagine going down on her. My God, Paul! Congratulations on your big day again. Sylvia said you were here. Yes. Where else would I be? I happened to be in the area and thought... maybe... Nothing else. Yes. I have to go. Um... Lock up when you're done here. The view's better on the inside. Trust me. I've always held to other truths. Gray zones. Where did you get these? An old woman. They're her letters. She wrote them to her lover. He was fighting in the war. She did it for years. Even after he died. Yes. Go ahead. Well? It's nice when families pass things down. No family. Just a father. It was his house. I spent a lot of time here as a kid. He died. Do you owe him a lot? Your father? Do you owe yours a lot? What do you think about photography? So, what do you say? STORAGE THE POWER OF HOPE That old junk. We could have done that together. You could help me sell that stuff on the Internet. It's probably worth some money. You can keep the money, of course. Will you come to me in my dreams from time to time? I'll welcome you with outstretched arms and kiss your breath away. You'll take me over like an... like an heir moving back into his deserted palace. Gates and doors ﬂy open with unseen hands and down below in the park the fountain begins to splash happily. Hey! Bam! Right in the muff! That's what happened. The whole school knows. So much for being an "exemplary school." And I had such high hopes. Just when you think you know someone. The way you take digs at each other. - Poor girl. - Mom! - What I dug was the meatloaf. - Ha-ha! We're focusing on Nazi propaganda in history class now. Leni Riefenstahl was called the "Reich's Glacial Crevasse." The creation of illusion, classical and naturalistic drama. - That's what we'll be doing from now on. - You can't be serious. The school is under terrible pressure. Female students must not be put in danger. - Huh? But Ms. Hüller! - What? That idiot Kupferschlag. All because of her! No, no, it's not right to say that. I mean... The poor girl. We've all invested a thousand hours in this, no question. With that in mind... Hey, I... They'll get over it. As long as they're mad at you, just stick with me. Listen, I know how you feel. I... We... You know the bathroom here? Where you can usually find some peace? We had this dumb bet in the ninth grade and I had to go in there and beat off. But they had a camera in there and uploaded the video and when I came to school the next day... One of those little shits in sixth or seventh grade. One stone and bam: he's the hero of his gang. It'll be fine. Erich, you almost died. And if Dala Brünne or her parents press charges... if we convince them that we can resolve this internally... And the thing with Schatterhain? We'll have to cooperate closely with the police. - More closely... - No police! - A policeman is supposed to be coming... - Okay! You know Mr. Bulwer and Mr... from the parent-teacher association. And this is Detective... Stöbhaas from the police. Thank you. Right, as your... principal Mr. Kupferschlag said I'm Detective Stöbhaas from the police. Is this about Dala? As many of you may have already heard, a new student at school, David Schatterhain, went missing a while ago. The weird kid? it turns out he was the victim of a homicide. David was... found at the old viaduct in the woods near the athletic club that many of you belong to. And since a few of you knew him personally... - What are we being accused of? - My dear Mr. Stöbhaas... Yeah, yeah, right, um... To be clear, no one is being accused of anything. Otherwise we'd be having this conversation at the station. Our investigation at the athletic club has hit a dead end and we thought you might be able to help us. Yeah, right. The new guy. So, let me ask you directly. Who of you was at the club on Monday the 15th? - You? - No. We have Mondays off. - No one has soccer practice on Monday. - It's all aerobics and fitness freaks. Most of us play ping pong, right? Except Lucas and Paul. Lucas and Paul? - You're Paul? - No. Lucas. But I wasn't there. I was in bed sick. - And... you were at the club? - No. - No? - Yes, but just for a minute. I dropped my brother off. I understand. Anyone else? So, Paul, what have we got? I'll tell you. We've got this student under the bridge. Dead. The autopsy shows he was hit on the head with a blunt object. At first we thought it was an accident. A stone. But we never found the stone. Rainstorms the following days washed away the evidence. We also have a passer-by who saw a teenager. About five and a half feet tall. Slim build. Hooded sweatshirt. At about... 5:30 p.m. near the abandoned viaduct. Do you know what I think, Paul? That it can't be easy for you. I mean... You're always home on time, keep your younger brother out of trouble. You... Do you have a girlfriend? Yes, I do. Dala Brünne. Where was Dala that afternoon? Did you see each other? Yeah, we saw each other that day. Did you call her? No, I left my phone at home. But we'd planned to meet up. - Where? - On my way home, more or less. Oh. Then you took the least direct path. No. Sure you did. The street along Gleichenborn. Not through the woods? It's nicer there, quieter. - No. - Okay. I was young once, too, you know. You walk here, you walk there... What did you do? Just hung out. All right, all right. Okay, Paul... then I won't take up any more of your time. If anything else comes to mind... Okay? - Detective? - Yes? I don't want to say anything that might... Say what you have to say. There was an older guy that day. He talked to me outside the club, wanted something. It was... kind of... strange. - Can you tell me what he looked like? - I know his name. Falk Ernstmeier. F-A-L-K. For our project. I knew my father had one from the old days. He used to take architecture photographs... Come in. Cool. My mom brought them back from vacation. Sweet. Your stepmother did all the furnishings? Sylvia. It's... nice. in our house the living room is total chaos. I need to use the bathroom. Sure, it's down the hallway. Oh, those. Your brother is really sweet. Silas. And this is Sylvia? Silas? I want to see your room, Paul. Let me in. You and Dala Brünne, huh? I saw her. Is this the first time you played with her? Or did you already do it at school? It was a bet. With a buddy. To see who was braver. Then he didn't want to do it anymore. Then I was alone. I couldn't talk to anyone about it because... it just got crazier and crazier. Oh well. Anyway... Thanks. Dalalala. La la la la... I had a weird dream last night. So much crazy stuff is happening. Don't you think? That guy in the woods. What happened here. The police sniffing around. Bulwer. And then last night I saw Dala. I ran into her. Just brieﬂy. She just started talking to me, but... what she said and how she said it... I can't recreate it. Do you know her look? When she... explores you with her eyes? Yeah, you know it. Dala was acting odd. Something strange is going on with her. It is. Someone... What do you want from her? Friendship. You know, Paul, I... I could have her. I know I could. Could you see if she'll talk to me? Paul? I'm not convinced. What does the Brünne girl say about it? Last I saw he was going into the auditorium. There's no other way into the auditorium from outside. Fine. It will rain frogs. The boy will have to face the music. He'll be punished. I'll make sure of that. How did he act during the rehearsals with Dala? To put it in a nutshell: over familiar. Max Gunthermann is more than just a difficult student. He's devious, manipulative. I've been observing Max for a whole year. He exudes something other students don't have that disturbs the class. He thinks he's charismatic, quick-witted. I think he's dangerous. He's been allowed to get away with a lot. That was a mistake. There have been several incidents in my presence that... Max threatened... I suggest the three of us continue this discussion in private. And you don't think he acts strange sometimes? He hasn't been back to Mrs. Hauck's either. "It'll be fine. He'll get into a good college. At college you don't find friends, they find you." Bull. I have the impression he sneaks out on a regular basis. At least other people give me annoying advice, Per-Ulrich. Per-Ulrich! How can you be like that? I used to think he was meeting a girl. But he doesn't have a girlfriend. He doesn't have one. It's something else. Um... Schäfer said their guy would stay at my mother's until everything's done? - Mhm. - That makes sense. Paul! Hi. Our toothpaste has gone missing. Probably because it's so tasty! Could you go to the drugstore for me? Thank you. Sylvia? Honey? Come on. Come on, it's okay. Come on and help, you idiot! It's okay now. You're fine. Low blood sugar. What are you doing here? I came about the project. Your photo series? That's why? There are other places you could go. Who took them? Dala. What does it mean? You tell me, Mr. Bulwer. Did she ask you first? She's using you. How long have you been seeing each other? Since she found out about your writing? What motivates this Dala anyway? What fascinates her? She likes an and taking pictures. And she acts a lot. Is she good? ls Dala getting support? Is she planning to audition for an acting school? Has she been asked to act in bigger productions? What do other people think of her? Let me guess. I know: "little miss big star wannabe." What happens now? I mean, what will her next... What could a Dala ever be other than an object on the stage? An empty vessel begging to be filled? A little naive stage magic for some crude actualism. Unlike us, she doesn't know the magic moment. When the illusion of art unveils itself as your own truth. It's really nice here. Quiet. No one ever comes here. - Except Paul. - Only every now and then. What do you do for fun? Paul. I don't know. Just nothing? How uncool. It should happen outside, in nature. Or in a quiet place. And the theme... You tell me. No. Nothing she already knows. The mouth of a girl Who had long lain in the reeds Looked so chewed up Finally in a bower under the diaphragm We found a nest of young rats I know you want to make it up to me, but... The light. Just one more. Please. The last one. I can hear you. I know you're there, Paul. Stöbhaas and two officers picked me up. In front of the whole club. You can't get to me, you know? I have friends, Paul! I know boys like you. You're polite, you're nice. And that's all. So don't forget to get your parents' permission. - Anyone under 18... - But Ms. Miescher! Aren't these DNA tests just a way to get the culprit to confess? My dear Leon, none of us knows how the investigation is going or what the police are planning. The principal is committed to cooperating closely with the police to resolve this tragedy, okay? So, let's hear your presentations. Who wants to go first? - I'm looking for Paul Nebe. - Okay. Do you know where he might be? Wait a minute. Hold on. There he is. Paul Nebe? Yes? Could you come with us, please? Your father was in a car accident. Come with us. - How can you not know something like this? - The name again? "Nebe". My God! North, Emil, Bertha, Emil. I'm so sorry Mrs. Nebe, but my shift... just started. Paul! The car is totaled. I thought Dad might have to... - How is he? Seriously injured? - He's in a terrible state of shock. Could you say a few words to him? I'm sure he'd be happy to see you. Yeah, I'm sorry that... It was totally... How are you? Good. Nice to hear. Ms. Schatterhain... My name is Paul Nebe and I... need to talk to you about your son. That means you... you've been here before, right? Your face looks so familiar to me. No. David and I knew each other from the running club or from the bus. We didn't connect at first, but then... I think he called the area here a "stuffy dump". He always said he wanted to move to Berlin and live in some artist commune. We had a lot of laughs. It might sound strange, but... David didn't have many friends. He was good at meeting new people, but... holding on to them... You don't know how much this means to me. That there was someone he confied in. Hey. I got held up. You look kind of sleepy. I heard you got pulled out of biology class. No big deal. - I bet we can start rehearsing again soon. - Sure, now that Max... As of today, Ms. Brünne can get on stage whenever she wants. I'm sure I can get the auditorium for you too. Just tell me who you want to be there. From school... Your brother? All your friends? You're finally eighteen, huh? I have my sources. No. Why are you being like this? Why... do you always do this? I wasn't going to say anything, but... I know that you looked through my bag. Paul! They're going to suspend me. What did you tell them about me? The school, the principal, the goddamn police? - I just told Bulwer... - Listen, you don't know him. Okay? No one does. He follows people. People from our school. I caught him once. Since then he's been tormenting me. He constantly makes insinuations. I... What? That's not true about Bulwer. He's a bit odd, but he has another side. So you bad-mouthed me to "Wheels"? I told him you're frivolous and ﬂaky. But that you're nice. Honestly, that you're a friend. Can you talk to Dala again? I... I promise. The body inﬂates the dress As if it were a white ship in the wind The lifeless eyes stare up, Enormous, blind Into a sky of cloud-pink rosiness Show me the pictures. I took the pictures, but the camera... It broke. There's something else we could... I have a new poem, Mr. Bulwer. Then let's hear the poem. Go ahead. The author isn't always the best reciter of his own work. Go ahead. Who wrote this? Me. Who? Who did you get it from? It can't be anyone else at school. How long have you been following me? What? Exactly You were out to get me. Are you the stone thrower? What? It was you, wasn't it? In the night? On the bridge? Who else? You wanted to get to me. You wanted my trust. You wanted to get into my house. You wanted to get to this very point. Who are you? Who do you need? Mr. Bulwer, I just wanted to do a good project with you. Out. Get out. Leave my house. Go. Should we go? While the weather's good? Birthday boy? Doesn't he want to? - It's getting late. - You two go ahead. I'm so happy for Paul. Such a beautiful cake. The new car is wonderful, Per-Ulrich. Tornado red, light metal rims. Dad? Was there a less gay model? ls that the police? - Why are they at our house? - No idea. Silas! - Silas? - Hey! Stop! Police! Hold on a moment now. What are... Mr. Nebe? We have a warrant for your son's arrest. - What? - Please stay there. - Stay there. - You can't do this. Stay calm. An arrest warrant for... premeditated murder? Come up. Whose house is this? An old woman used to live here. No one ever visited her. She was always so alone. My mom doesn't want me to see you anymore. That detective came to see us. He wanted to talk to me. He told me to tell him the truth. What did you do? I lied. Let... me go. Paul! Let me go! Please! Paul! Let me go! "Such a nice, well-behaved boy." "So good-looking." That's what the other mothers say. Is it envy, Paul? And then the videos of stones being thrown at people. And he had things belonging to one of the victims. Why didn't you take better care of your brother? What kind of person are you, Paul? What kind of person are you, huh? - What kind of person are you? - Sylvia? Sylvia. It's okay. Let him go. Come here. - Please. - Don't touch me! Go lie down now. I'll take care of this. Paul? Don't hold it against her. She's... I love you, my boy. Patrick Baker BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS
