(thunder clap) (film clicking) (dramatic music) (running footsteps) (running footsteps) - Ed! (rustling of leaves) Ooh, ah. - Boris. That's Boris. Oy! - This isn't happening, this isn't happening. - Boris! - Idiot. - This isn't happening. - Get down. They'll see him up there. - No one can see me, I'm blending in. (laughter) - Blending in. We can see you, you're fucking barking walking up a tree. - Boris, get down. They'll see you up there. (motorcycle engine thrums in distance) - What the fuck? What do you see, what is it? - Keep it down. (engine revs) (engine shuts off) (panting) - What? What is it? - It. (apprehensive music) - I really hate small people. (soft piano melody) - When I first saw you, I knew I'd be with you forever. - I don't think we should be walking in the middle of the road. Better to be hiding up a bloody tree. - Ha, funny, good one from you, idiot. - Look. We saw them go the other way. So if any survivors come this way, we'll meet 'em. - Survivors? - People. - Fucking bastards. - And what is it that we're meant to survive? Whatever they haven't. - And what's that? What the fuck's happened to everyone? - Not a clue. - How have you managed to survive? - No, not her. - Stay calm. - She was freaky the last time. - What do we do? We run, right, we run? - We can't. - I've only got three left. - Three what? What the fuck are you gonna do with that? - Put it away, Munch, we can outrun this one, nicely. - I'm tired of running, I'm knackered. - We can probably outwalk it. She's not exactly moving at pace and besides, she's on her own. - Wait a minute. I think that, yeah, that's the Jones' girl. Mary, no, no, no, Margaret. - What? - Yeah, it is. - Her mama drive a six-seat Toyota. Gave it a ticket last week, it was double-parked. - Suck this. Oh, touchdown. - What the fuck did you do that for? - Munch, that was a waste. - A waste? That was perfect. - Nailed it straight between in the eyes. - You just assaulted a little girl. - It wasn't a little girl, it was a zombie. - It was a little girl. - Zombie and I fucking nailed that shit right in the face. - C'mon, let's keep moving. - I'm gonna go and see if she's all right. - What? - Don't be ridiculous. - This could just be an... (zombie roars) - Go, go, go, go, go, go! - Boris, slow down! We need to stay together! - Out of all the survivors we could meet up with, we end up with Boris the boar! Could've been a sexy girl or a cool girl, someone cool. We end up with Boris, the twat. - He's not that bad. - He's a parking warden! (Boris yells) Twat! - C'mon. (grunts loudly) - Boris! - Where has he gone now? - Oh, I dunno. Let's get back out in the open. It's too dangerous. - Where did you learn your survival skills? - I delivered mail in Newcastle when I first joined the Service. - The Service. You mean, the post service. - Yeah, the postal service. (laughs) - You made it sound like you were in the bloody SAS. - No I didn't. - Yes ya did, ya plunker. (flapping) - Do you want me to tell you or not? - Yeah, all right, continue. When you first joined the service, did you have a number, double O - Now you're just taking a piss. - Yeah, and it's brilliant. - I do have a number actually. 1274. - All right, continue. When 1274 first joined the service. - Worked in Newcastle, on the estates. And every morning the kids'd throw water bombs at me. (dramatic music) - Oh, that sounds terrifying. - The dogs. (barks) - Oh, shit. Nice doggy, nice doggy. - Scary. - Worst of all, turd attacks. - What? - Turd attacks. Water bombs filled with shit. Little sodgers would throw 'em at me every morning on my round. [voice over] I used to find solace on the swings. My special place. (groans) Yeah. I learned a thing or two about survival type things. (dramatic music) (growling) Oh yeah? (music intensifies) Boom. - Boom! (laughs) - Yeah, might not have been the SAS, but those guys couldn't have survived that jungle. (yells in distance) - Boris? (more yells) Boris! Boris! - He climbed another bloody tree, the twat. - We need to help him. - And we haven't quietly. (zombie roar) - Guys, guys, help me! Help! - Bollocks. - Munch? Fire. - Boom! (cheers) - Boris! Boris! Get over here! Not again. Mulligan. - What did I tell you, twat! (yells at Boris) - Boris! - [Man in white shirt] She died peacefully. Should be thankful. - Thankful. Thankful! My wife is dead! And it's my fault! (panting) (zombie moans) - Why have you stopped? - This way, move, move! - Fuck! Boris, you fucking (incomprehensible insult)! Get back here now! - Move, get your leg over! (yelling at each other) (zombies growling) - Munch, get the fuck up! - I may have watched one too many horror films. - I would say they were zombies. - You're a fucking genius, aren't you. - Sure. - Keep moving. - Wait, can zombies climb? Or open doors? - I don't know anything about zombies. - No, but unfortunately there wasn't an options take or gee just seeing how it's five zombies, Munch. - Ah, but there was one who had to be an asshole and climb trees, Boris. - Stop being a pair of pricks, will you, and stay alert. This way. (ominous music) (footsteps) - Typical. Just when I need a drink, it's bloody closed. - You spend all day in the pubs. - No I don't, dickhead. Just the nights. - Wait here. - Empty. - By the looks of things, I gotta have you real quick. - Great. This just keeps getting better and better. - Still can't get a signal. - Wait, this pub is always busy. And always some idiot parks in the road. It's actually a perfect place to ticket on a Sunday. - You ticket on a Sunday? - The law never rests. Even when God does. - The law? You're not the law, you just give people tickets. - I uphold the law. - No you don't. You're a cop. - Munch, leave it alone. Give me that thing. - There must be somebody around. It can't be completely deserted. - Take a look around, dickhead. There's no one here. - [Munch] They could be inside. It's the perfect place to hold yourself up in a zombie apocalypse, a pub. - He's a kraut. - Hey, that cost me fifty quid! - Yeah, and it ain't worth shit when it don't work. - You know, I hate to admit it, but Munch Bunch could be right. There could be people holed up in here. - That makes sense. - Aw, shit. Let's get the fuck out of here and find out what's happened. - Yeah. Didn't work for him. - Come on. - Come on. (motorcycle engine roars past) - Keep quiet. - Quiet? Are you mental? They're the only half-normal people at the instances we've got here. - I wouldn't call that normal. - Guys, need help over here. - Get the fuck over here. (mutters angrily at him) - Jesus. - Stop! - Fuck! - Cut this out. - Do you want our help or not? - I just want to know what the hell is going on. - Look. We're just trying to stay alive. Keep moving. Now if we figure out what the fuck it is is going on around here. - Find somewhere safe. - There's nowhere safe here. - Somewhere must be. - The fuck is that? - C'mon. Need to head back to the fields. Now. - You stay with us. - Don't slow us down. - There's no fucking way I'm going back there. There's dead people everywhere. - There's nowhere safe around here. The government's closed off the whole town and the county borders. Cut off all supplies. No one's getting out of here alive, they'll kill anyone who tries. The whole place is under quarantine. - They're caging us in like fucking animals. The fields are our best bet. C'mon. - Stay if you want. - Hold on. How'd you know all this? - Look, I'll explain back at camp, okay? - I don't believe you. - Fine. - Good luck on your own. - Move. Move. (heavy music) - It's not much further. - I swear there's somethin moving in the bushes over there. - Nah. Must have been the wind. - The silence is making me nervous. - Yeah, it's quiet alright. - It's too quiet. - Next he's gonna say, I've got a bad feeling about this. Tosspot. (motorcycle roars past) - Hold up, guys. - That's the barn. - Whose is it? - I don't know, maybe it's a farmer's? - Well can we see if we can go inside? It's fucking freezing. - Don't you think he might be around? - Could be. Not when people live around here. - Go and check it out. Go on. - Doesn't feel right. (metal clinks) - You just gonna fucking stand there? - Just undo it from that hook thing. - It's so fucking heavy. (door creaks open) - Jesus Christ. - Hey, Munch. Need to shit. - Oh, fuck. (yelling) - Hey. - Chicks with, sticks. - Easy, kay? - Are any of you infected? - No. Are any of you? - No, nope. - Look, we don't have much here. But you can come in for a while if you want. - Thanks. - Guys? Guys, it's okay. - Can you just put... All right, all right. Fuckin hell. (zombie growls) - Shit. (thud) (zombie thuds against door) (thuds) (thuds) (porcelain clinking) (thuds) - Crap. - Come on, you zombie bastards. Fuck off back to your graves. - Okay. This place isn't safe. Nowhere is. There are too many of them, so just, keep the noise down. At all times. Okay? - I want you all to leave, now. And him over there is going to end up getting us all killed. - We agreed. Anyone endanger us, they leave. - Endanger. It's us who kept those zombies out. - And it was your guys who led the zombies here. - Those zombies were probably the farmer and his family. They live here. - Lived here. - I knew the farmer, and his family. I come up here to visit them. Look, they're here now, and it's not them we've got to be worried about. - We can leave. What you gonna do? Hm? Stay here? Don't think those zombies won't be back. They will. And what you gonna do then? You gonna fight them on your own? - Yeah, if we have to. - Look. We're just as scared as you guys. (laughs) - Fine. - But we leave first thing in the morning. - But even got where? There is no way out. - We know. - Before the government sealed the area off, loads of people were still able to escape. But we didn't get out. - Did you try to get out? - I was in a car with some friends. - Yeah, I see. - What happened? - They opened fire. - Who did? - The Army. - They've pruned us around the whole county, apparently. It's a fucking containment zone. - Why could that happen? - Well it happened with foot and mouth disease. - I thought they were cows that were quarantined. - Yeah. They were killed and burned, just for being in the infected area. - We're people. - And? - Bollocks, this is a load of bollocks. - You think I'm making this up? My friends being shot in front of me? And climbing out a fucking burning vehicle? Think of having a giggle in the countryside and this is how I put on my fucking vacations! - Hey, hey, hey, calm down. Look. This is news for all of us. There must be some way out of here. - Oh, you can try, but I don't think you'll have much luck. - People can't let this happen. - Turn back to the concentration camp victims. And the prisoners in Guantanamo. - My bars don't work, and the Internet's down. - The Internet's down. - All we can do is - Survive. - Look. Let's just get some rest, yeah. - I'm Dinah. - Simon. - Neville. - Nescal. - Ed. - Boris. - Munch. This is Tyra, and Tabitha. And I'm Vera. - You mind if we have a look around? - Sure. There's not much here. - Thanks. (whispering) - Honey. Honey. Wake up. Please. Honey. Doctor! - Okay. Here's our food supplies. - Is that it? - We've got quite a lot. - How'd you get all that stuff? - Zombies got met. Fought these zombie bastards from inside the bakery I work at. - It was horrible. Only propped out for a chocolate muffin. - Yeah? - It was nut. - There you go mate. - Thanks so much. - Enjoy. - I will. - Have a nice day. - Thanks, and you. - Bye. (bell tinkles) (thud against door) - The fuck? (zombie crashes against door) - Can someone call an ambulance? - Someone say call an ambulance? - What the fuck is that? - I don't know. - She looks like she's... - Fucking dead. - That's Mrs. Batesman. She looks unwell. - What do we do? - Fuck! - Fucking hell! - We should go out there and help her. - No, neither of us should open that door. - Where were you, Simon? - Um, I was just passing through with some friends too. Our car got shot by the Army. But I managed to escape. Found the shop, found these guys. And then when the Army and the zombies moved at me, we moved out. - Did you have to kill any of them? Yeah. Well, killed a few. - Nah, not killed. Knocked over. Hurt. Not killed. I doubt they died for long. - The dead are walking. - That's similar to my story. - No it isn't. - Yeah it is. Car accident, zombie attack, use me supplies to get by. Met you, got moving. I'm sorry, but a milk car is not a car. - Oh, let the handsome man tell his story. - Um. - Go on, Munch. - [voice over] Same shit, different day. Then, zombie attacked me. Hey, bugger off. Go on. Not again. Epic fight ensues, I the victor. High-speed getaway. - A high speed getaway on a milk float. - All right, don't get an erection. You can give me a speeding ticket if you want. - I don't do speeding tickets. - That's because you're not an officer of the law. - Excuse me. - Your stories are making me rather moist. - [voice over] Epic crash. (zombies moaning) - [voice over] And why did you crash? - [voice over] Because I saw your mum through the curtains of a nearby house taking a shit on some bloke's chest. - No you didn't. - No, you're right, it couldn't have been on that day. She was being rimmed on that day. - Mmm. Rimming. - Please, just finish your story. Quickly. - [voice over] Doubly epic fight scene. Ah, fuck this! Hello? Hello? - [voice over] Found a safe spot, ate my rations until Ed came by and saved me. - So you're the hero. - Yeah. No, that's Munch. He's just being moist. - [voice over] My story is one of survival. Good morning, Mrs. Thatcher. How are you this morning? - [voice over] It was only this morning that I knew something was wrong. Terribly wrong. Morning, Mr. Thunketts. - [voice over] Looking back now, it seemed so obvious. - [voice over] How could I have missed it? When I realized, I stopped dead in my tracks. Somethin's wrong. I got a bad feeling about this. - You didn't say that. - Yeah I did. - Bollocks. - All right, maybe I'm just colorizing the story a little. - Go on. - [voice over] I realized the Jehovah's Witnesses leaflets that weren't stuck in the envelope boxes as usual. Mrs. Thatcher? The Jehovah's Witnesses not been around flyering this morning? Mrs. Thatcher? What the fuck? Yeah. Then I found Munch. Found Boris up a tree. Found you guys. - That's enough stories for now. We need some rest before tomorrow. - Tyra, you're on guard duty with me. But you all try and get some sleep. - Well I never much liked sleeping alone. - I'll always be with you. - You'll be with to to be with me. Fed up with our English ways. - But it's not more than that. - I know. That's why I love you. Because you never give up. I'll always be with you because of that. Always. - We can't keep running forever. - If we stay in one places, the zombies will kill us. If we try to escape, the Army will kill us. What we need to do is we need to try and find a way to tell people what's happening here. - That's the last thing I care about. - Yeah. Well you didn't see your friends being shot down by the Army. - The Army killed my family. I went to pay for petrol. I just kept running, left the bodies behind. - Why haven't you said anything til now? - Can't even remember the last thing I said to me mum. There was screaming, gunshots. I just kept running. Not if we're so lucky. - Yeah. When we first found you, I thought you'd just been attacked by zombies. - Zombies, the Army. They're both the same in my eyes. They're both the enemy. - Yeah, it certainly seems that way. - Status report. IDC Air Private 247, come in. - [Voice on walkie talkie] Continue, 247. - Five male, four female. All en route to location. However, all civilians are uninfected, over. - [Voice on walkie talkie] Continue to eradication area 69. - Simon's working for the Army. - He's trying to take us somewhere to be killed. - This stays between us for now. - All civilians are uninfected, I repeat, all civilians are uninfected, over. - C 247, regardless. - You're a... Are you out of your mind, I will not lead innocent civilians to their deaths. I won't do it. - [Voice over walkie talkie] Failure to comply will result in termination. (zombies moaning and growling) (door creaks open) - Okay, follow Neville. Ed, we'll hold the zombies off. - Will we? - We'll help you. - No. It's too dangerous. - We can hold our own. - Well what're you waiting for? Get out there. - Fine. (yelling amongst themselves) - Come on! Run! - Very distracted zombies. - [Ed] Boris! This way! - [Munch] Run! Boris! (yells) (motorcycle engine) (panting) - No, they'll hear you! - Back! - No, they'll hear you! (gunshot) (dramatic string music) - Come on, let's go. (motorcycle engine) (dramatic music) - We need to get the hell out of here. - No, we need to get back to the old house. (zombie growls) (man yells) - Go, go, go! - You should stay with her for a while. I'll get a priest for the body. She's gone. (motorcycle engine hums) - They got a motor blood. What's the deal with them? - Yeah, their wannabe Ghost Rider. - Seems almost alive. - It's like he's part human, part walking dead. - Ha, might be like Boris then. - Wherever he goes, more undead follow, so just, let's not get his attention, yeah? - Well, we've got it now. - Yeah, no thanks to you. - Whoa. What's that? - What? What is it? - A, forest or some (girl screams) (zombie roar) - Everyone stay alert. - You okay? You okay? - [Girl] I'm fine, don't worry. - Where there's one, there'll be more. - There's more. There's more. - Run. Go, go. (dramatic music) - [Ed] You okay? - Look. - That's some seriously fucked up shit. - I don't like the look of that. - No, me neither. How far is the shelter anyway? - Just over the field. There's a barn and a church. House is a few fields further. - How do you know that, dear? - I live close by. Or I did. (clink of silverware) (rustle of pages) - Oh. Dad, I was gonna say, I'm not gonna be home for dinner tomorrow, I'm going to Hannah's, if that's fine. What? What are you doing? Dad? Dad, what's... (screams) - Tabitha, is it far? - How's your leg, Dani? - It's not slowing me down. - Okay. We find shelter, we stay here tonight. - [Man] Doctor! - She's gone. I'm so very sorry for your loss. - There's gotta be something you can do. - There's nothing. - Please. - She's dead. She died peacefully, you should be thankful. - Anything could be in there. - Where are you going, Boris? - You said the plan was to go to the next safe location. I don't call that safe. - The fuck is wrong with you? Get back in there. - We'll check it out. - That's what I was afraid of. - Just wait here. - I don't think so. We're in this together, remember. - Bravery often means stupidity. - Look who's talking. - Stop the cop will ya and just stay alert. - Stay close. - Boris. - This way. - You can leave your milk at my backdoor, if you'd like. - I could what? - Are you cold, love? (corn rustles) (starts yelling) (zombie growls) (all shouting) - Boris! Boris! - Boris! - Boris! - Boris! - Fuck. (panting) - Boris! - I can't hear anything. - Vera. - She's gone. - Sh. Hold silent. (growls) (all begin yelling) - Run! Run! (yelling amongst themselves) - Come on. - C'mon! Move, move! (motorcycle roars) - Guys, wait! (zombie growls) - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! It's okay. Come on. Come on. Come here. (gate creaks) - Careful. - Everything looks clear. - Always does. - If there's anyone in there, we get away. Quickly. - Get away where? - Which one of us could answer that? (handle creaks) - Looks okay. (woman gasps) - Hell will rest upon your souls. Hell is being raised. - Is he pissed? - Seven souls. Seven steps. Seven days to hell. You see, my child, it's imminent. - What's imminent? What's imminent? - Hell! - Take this. - Thank you. - It's the only thing that can save you. - Don't understand. - What are you on, 'cause I'm havin whatever you're havin. - I'm on God! - Oh, well, we'll give that a miss then. - Who are you? - Father Lawrence. - And you? I know all of you. You're the dead! (laughs wildly) - What do you mean, that salt can save us? - [voice over] In the voodoo religion, the dead can be revived by a balker. He captures their souls. Their former bodies become the undead and will remain under the balker's control. - Voodoo. Bollocks. Next he'll be talking about leprechauns. - Don't talk to me about bloody leprechauns. Lord. - What were you saying about the balker? Please, continue. - Please? - [voice over] Souls of the recently departed have seven days in limbo. A soul has seven steps to pass before resting. Passing the seven archangels. In passing the seven steps your faith towards your next life is sealed, and only then will your soul find rest. Seven souls must be collected by the balker. He will call upon the controller of the dark spirit world, Kalfu. Seven days before a dawn, where the balker will hold the power of the seven archangels. The souls must be held upon Earth for seven days. At midnight on the seventh day, the balker would own all the souls of the dead. Even those who have passed the seventh stage. The balker becomes eternal, reborn, as the king of the undead. - I have known. - [voice over] The dead will rise, closing the gap between hell and Earth. (zombie growls) - Walk with the undead. (distant laughter) - On the 27th of October, the seventh day. - That's tomorrow. - How can we stop him? And how can this save us? - Voodoo legend says that the dead will return to their graves when they are fed salt. - Yeah, if they don't tear your throat first. - So, the balker is actually a zombie king? The zombie king? Feed him some salty fish and chips, job done. - But the Zombie King isn't dead, is he? - The balker will only die when the seven souls have been released from the bottle he holds around his neck. - We'll never get near him. There's too many zombies. - Then the world will become undead. - Are we actually believing this? - Why not? - You got any better suggestions? - Everyone's dying, getting up, and killing each other! It doesn't get more serious than that! - It sounds far-fetched, but I have to be honest with you. A drunk priest with a half-cooked story sounds like something to try. The Army aren't coming to save us, they're coming to kill us. The only thing that makes any sense now is just trying to get out of this madness. - This is madness. - You got something better to do? - I say we kick some zombie ass. - Let's kick some zombie ass, complete this quest, and find something else to do with the rest of our days. - But this could be a virus or anything, which could be cured, and then we'd all be okay. - Yeah, all right, Dorothy. You click your red shoes together and wait, we're gonna kill some shit. - Who's in? - But wait. None of us have killed a zombie before, apart from Ed with a shotgun. So what we need to do is we need to take it one step at a time yet, and you are gonna have to prove to me that feeding zombies salt actually is gonna kill them. - When I said feeding, I meant getting in into their bloodstream. And if you want me to prove it, bring me a fucking zombie. (thud on door and zombie growls) - Blimey. (dramatic music) - God guide my hand. - Good throw. - NFL. Every Sunday. - You watch American football? Me too! Go Eagles! (ominous music) (breathes heavily) (door slams shut) - It's dead. Totally dead. - The only other way to kill them outright is with a massive brain hemorrhage. - Yeah that one I shot didn't get back up. - How do you know all this? - All priests learn about the beliefs of other cultures. Voodoo is a particular favorite of mine. - A shotgun to the head isn't in any bible I ever saw. - No that's pure Resident Evil, the Lord knows I love that game. - [Munch] Me too (laughing). - Okay, so, we need to find weapons and get salt yeah? - Then kill some shit. - Yeah, and try and stay alive. - Does anyone have a plan, how to do all of that? - Father Lawrence? - Don't go in the shed. - This church itself, west of the river isn't it? - Yeah but what does that mean? - It means we're back in my post code. (banging) (bottle clatters) Just down the road were a couple of stores. One that would definitely have some more salt. Me, Scott, and Neville will make off for there. - We'll need to be armed. - We will be. (screams) There's enough crucifixes here to keep those zombies prayin' if we don't get close to 'em. - But we don't have much salt. - True. - We use it sparingly and when necessary until we get some more. - And while we're riskin' our necks, what are these guys doin'? - I'm glad you asked. Tara, Simo, Munch. You guys will need to get more weapons. There must be something of use around here. - We can manage that. - What about me? - And me. - Okay, gimmie a moment. Danny, you're hurt. - Well, for fuck sake, I'm fine. - You need to stay here. Tabitha, you need to stay with her. - Look, you can stay here and make the place secure. - That's good thinking, Neville. Let's meet back here in an hour. We'll wait out the night, plan for tomorrow. - Then we bring the pain. - A good plan. Nothin' will go wrong. (somber music) - [Doctor Carter] You should stay with her for a while. I'll get a priest for the body. She's gone. She is gone. Nothing that can be done. (door creaks) - Shh. - What? This might be my last. - It's a good idea. Let's take what we can, supplies. Guys, burn it. Let's get some salt and get the hell out of here. (screaming) (roars) (tense music) Leave it. Leave it. - Fuck. How do you think the others are gettin' on? - Hopefully better than us. - We take what we can, okay? I think it's empty. - Of course it's empty, it's a fucking shed. You think some zombie went in there looking for tools and locked himself in? (growls) (shouts) (growling) - Help me for fuck's sake! (dramatic music) (kick thuds) - Death by shoe. - This is fucking ridiculous. - You're tellin' me. Oh, a wank cupboard. - What? - Makes sense now. Poor bastard probably went in for one last shuffle before he died. - You fucking serious? - Well, how else would you explain it? (door slams) Whoa, easy. - There's fuck all for us to use for weapons in there. - Unless lube contains salt. A joke! I was joking. - Guys. Look. - Thought you work around here. I deliver milk. If they don't drink milk, they're no concern of mine. - Maybe something we can use. - Look at all those zombies headin' towards it. - Weird. - Yeah, weird. - Weird? It's weird that they're zombies at all. (gasps) (punches thud) (growling) You just hit a policeman. - You can let go now. - Yeah. - It's too dangerous, let's get back inside. - Well, we haven't found anything yet. - There's nothing to fucking find! (tense music) Let's get inside! (breathes heavily) Thanks. (thuds) (dramatic music) - I know who you fucking are. And what you tried to do. - You're back. - Just. - Where's Scott? - He didn't make it. - Where's Simo? - He got munched. - What? - I'm cursed. - We are all cursed. - This fucking again. - The hour is almost upon us. - Short and sweet. We got the salt. - Yeah, as much as they had. - We didn't find anything in the shed. - Yeah, it was, uh... - Renovated. - Renovated? - Did you guys find anything in here? - Yeah. A few bits and bobs. The priest must've been stocking up himself. - He must've needed somewhere else to keep it while his shed was out of action. (door slams) - That's the place secure. - Okay, everywhere is latched down. - Good. Guess we'll just have to wait out the night. And, at first light, we attack. - Where's Father Lawrence? - I'm here, children. Father's quite safe. - Perhaps the good father can help us with our plan of attack tomorrow. - Okay. - Lay a curse upon the Zombie King. - Sure. - You know how to defeat him? - No problem. - Can we trust him? - We have no choice. - This is crazy. (somber music) - I remember when I first saw you, I knew I'd be with you forever. - I'll always be with you. You moved here to be with me. With our English ways. - Well, it was a lot more than that. - Oh? Sparkles. Because you never give up. I'll always be with you because of that. Always. - Don't talk like that. Honey? Honey? Wake up. Please. Honey. Doctor! Doctor! - She's gone. I'm so very sorry for your loss. - There's gotta be something you can do. - There's nothing. - Please. - She's dead. She died peacefully, you should be thankful. (tense music) - Thankful? Thankful? My wife is dead! And it's my fault. - You should stay with her for a while. I'll get a priest for the body. She's gone. She is gone. There's nothing that can be done. There's always something that can be done. (dramatic music) - I managed to get you somethin' from the shop. - You got me somethin'? - Yeah. Thought you could use 'em. - Sweet. (tense music) - This is fucking crazy. - Remember, stick to the plan, guys. It's a great plan. That was a crap plan. - Oh, really? Well, do you have a better one? - Taking a shit on a lesbian's chest while a midget tickles your testicles with his tongue is a better plan than that. - We need to know what we're dealing with better before we go back out there. - Yeah, I mean, like, what does this Zombie King want? (laughs) - You're all lambs to the slaughter. - I've had enough of this shit. Everyone's dying, everyone's raising from the dead. What the fuck is going on? - Give me my wine back. - No. Not until you tell us what the fuck... What the fuck is going on? - Fine. But, I have to pop to the shed first for a quick pray. (ominous music) (helicopter whirs) Kalfu is a dark god of mayhem. - I thought you only believed in one God. - In the voodoo religion, he's a dark god of mayhem. - That's it. - He's been called upon by the Zombie King to raise the dead. - But, why would anyone want to raise the dead? Why would anyone do that? - May I have my wine back. - No. - Fine. Samuel Peters was a member of my community. He was a good and honest man, who became a lost soul. His struggle to deal with the loss of his wife lead him towards a darkened path. His obsession with her led him to having her ashes scattered by the lake outside a temple. A temple with its own dark past, and a secret location only he and I know the whereabouts of. - Do you mean the temple across from here? - How do you know where it is? - Because I looked out from the church and I saw it. - How do you know where it is? - 'Cause I... I knew what he was doing and tried to stop him. His infatuation with her led him to dabble in the dark arts of voodoo. He became unrecognizable to me. The man I once knew was no longer there. And the presence of something more evil than I had ever encountered before was without doubt in that room with us. - Kalfu was in the room? - Yes. I heard them speak. - Why didn't you stop this earlier? - Can I have my wine back now, please. - If you knew this was gonna happen, then why didn't you... - I didn't expect it to bloody work. - Kalfu, I'm giving my blood as sacrifice. I will be your servant, to summon you as my master. Bring fire to flesh. (malevolent laughter) - You bring me forth to bring another back. Give me your reasons for this worthwhile attack. - I don't mean no offense or harm. - None given, none taken. - Now give me the name, this soul to abuse. (laughs) - Abuse? - Yes, I'll bring this soul back from Hell. From the world it originally fell. It may be painful, and it will be grim, but that is the payment for life of sin. (laughs) - My wife. - Say no more, I know she. And deserved of torment she'll be. Hold seven souls for seven days and let me work on their evil ways. (tense music) - Some crazy voodoo shit. - You're whole world's about to die because of it. - Nice. - How can we stop them? Is it even possible? - Zombies will descend upon the church tonight. And, in the morning, the walker... - Samuel Peters. - Samuel Peters. - Gay name. - Will finalize his pact with Kalfu. On the nightfall on the seventh day, the moon will turn completely red and the dead will rise. And then there will be no stopping them. - Can't we just try to sneak up on this Zombie King? (laughs) He'll know you're killing his zombies. He'll feel it. And then, there's be a whole army of zombies guarding him. - So, basically, what you're saying is... (dramatic music) - It's time for an all out attack. In the name of The Father, The Son of the Holy Spirit. (shouting) (weapons thud) Next. - Stick together and head for the temple. (bat thuds) - There are too many of them! - I said let's go to the door! Munch! - Kalfu, walk with me in allegiance, the dead at arkmun. (malevolent laughter) (whispers) (malevolent laughter) - Clever boy. Seven souls, the seventh day. Just a few hours, and you will have your way. (laughs) You have appeased me well. But, there is something you forgot to tell. - What? - What? You said it was your wife you wanted here with you. But, you have another wife. We did not make a deal for two. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean her. - You're about to raise all the dead, so, you shall have both back. That's not fair, so, I'll take your soul instead. - When in battle, remember this. The first seven who were raised from the dead, they are the most powerful. I wouldn't risk getting too close. (tense music) (punches thud) - Munch! (screams) (kicks thud) (screams) - Munch! - He's at the 17. He's at the 16! (shouting) (punches thud) - Munch! - He's at the 15! (laughs) (laughs) Boom! (laughs) (chants in foreign language) Is there a 20? - Come on, Munch, one more! - [Tabitha] Do it, Munch, come on. - Ed? You've got the last waffle. - Munch! No! (screams) Munch! - No, Munch! Edward! It's time to be the hero! Do not die for one more drink. (growls) (screams) God bless you, my son! Inside, now! (chanting in foreign language) - Hear me, for I am Kalfu! Your dead have deserted you now. (laughs) (glass shatters) - Nice try, but... (laughs) But, it's simply too late. The chant has begun. Death and you are dead. - That's terrible rhyming. - Yeah, really bad. - Vile. - Pathetic. (dramatic music) (screams) (whispering) - Let's finish this. (shouting) (malevolent laughter) - [Kalfu] Tick tock goes the clock. Another soul, another day. I'm the keeper of the crossroads. The man to meet your souls of the dead. Die, and meet your Michelle! (screaming) (tense music) - Well, we did it. - No one will ever believe us. - They might, when things go back to normal. - We'll see. (rumbling) You have got to be fucking kiddin' me. - No fucking way. - Dad, there's more of 'em. They're covered in blood, they must be zombies. - No! (gun fires) (somber music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (whispers) - Welcome to Hell. - This is Earth. - (laughs) Yeah, I guess. Hell on earth. - What? I know, I know. Seven souls, seven days. Yeah, when Kalfu closed the gates of Hell, I tried to stop him. I failed. I guess the dead are just gonna have to walk the living plane, 'cause they have nowhere else to go. - What about the people that are still alive. - They're just gonna have to deal while the war rages on, I guess. - Between whom? - [Samuel] Kalfu and the army of the undead. - Yeah, it's gonna be bad ass. - So, we're dead. - Yup. Just gotta choose your side. - What did I tell you, man? This voodoo shit is bad ass! Boom! (rock music)
