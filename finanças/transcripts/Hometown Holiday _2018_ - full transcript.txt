You hate online sensations. Okay, Wes Gently isn't just another online sensation. He's not some sixteen year old kid who crashed the vehicle his parents got him for his birthday. Real people can relate to this. You mean adults? Yeah. Okay, listen to this story. Man loses his wife, okay, writes a beautiful song for her. His 8-year-old son records him playing that song and uploads it to the Internet titled "My dad sings for you". He thought his dad would be less lonely playing for a bunch of people instead of just himself. So what are you offering? A good looking single dad with not so much as a parking ticket, is going to get a full contract. I'm talking music, live shows, TV deals. Then later endorsements. This guy could do everything, I promise. And we're going to make him some good money. And? And the agency will have to make me a partner. There it is. I'm sorry, the biggest Internet sensation ever just so happens to live in the same town as my pregnant sister so... No reason not to go for a visit. Thank you. And then if I just so happen to run into Mr. Smash Hit and I just so happen to have a contract on me, that seems like fate. I'm pretty sure that is the opposite of fate. Well, it's my fate to be partner in the next twelve months so... Your bag, tickets, aisle seat, car reservations, copies of the contract for Mr. Smash Hit, and Bob-Da-Bear. A teddy bear? It's for your sister's unborn child. ♪ ♪ You lying, good for nothing! All I wanted was a quick shower after flying the red-eye. I have no idea why you're yelling at me. You're being outrageous.

It seems my boyfriend has a girl in every town along his flight route. And they say that pigs can't fly. They're just friends. Stop being so paranoid. Wrong answer. I'd duck. Get yourself a lift! Krista, please! My bags, my uniform! I'd get out of here. If she runs out of clothes to throw, it's going to be a pitch fork. Here! Five dates. Five! For nothing. You Dalton girls are crazy. Sorry sis. Don't apologize. He's too forward anyway. I answered his phone while he was in the shower. Let's just say Kimberly from Cincinnati was just as confused as I was. What type of girl did he think you were? These city guys are all the same. They just tell you exactly what you want to hear. You and whoever else they might be dating. I don't know.

But at least we're keeping the paint store in business. I've narrowed it down. I just can't decide between sunshine yellow and lemon tart. Anyway, you're here for the perfect weekend. There's a wedding this afternoon. You should come. I can't just go to somebody's wedding. Of course you can. Oh, butter biscuit! That was a good one too. Here we go again. I don't even know the bride or groom. They're not going to want a stranger at their wedding. Oh, that's not how things work around here. You're with us. Just come along. Besides, Wes Gently is going to be there. It would be the perfect chance for you to get to talk to him. That Internet scene guy lives out here? Weird. You really think that Darryl and I don't know why you chose now to come visit our home for the first time? You're pregnant with my first niece or nephew. Really? I brought a teddy bear. - Ah! - Bob-Da-Bear! How are you buddy? It's okay. I get it. You've always been driven to succeed. He'd be an amazing talent to sign. Okay. I know that Wes lives out here but I'm here to see you. You're my wonderful sister. And your perfect husband as well. Thanks. So are you coming to the wedding? If you insist. So. You're not going dressed like that though, are you? Like this? This is a $5,000 suit. Women love me in this suit. Come with me. Come on. Okay. This is the one. There you go. Seriously?

Oh, um, so, Chris told me that she doesn't think you emailed my head shots to your casting friend. Sorry, I haven't got it off today. I've been really busy trying to sign an important client. Yeah, I know babe but, remember when you told me, you would do anything to make me happy? Well you sending my head shot to your casting friend that would make me so so happy. Yeah you're a hundred percent right, as always, and I will get that off today. I'm sure there's an Internet connection out here somewhere. Ah, thanks babe. Listen, are you going to be around later... Ah, I'm sorry. You're breaking up. I'm driving through the canyon. Yeah, I'll call you later, okay. Muwh, muwh, kisses. I told you he didn't send it. I reminded him four times. I mean what kind of a lawyer is he? I'll tell you! Not a very good one if he can't even get this done. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Please be seated. We are gathered here today to join Cindy and Charles in holy matrimony. We used to have to sneak into the barn to see the weddings. Best seats in the house. Do you remember when Mary Ellen refused to marry Bobby Nicholson until he put on a tie? And he had to borrow the limo driver's. That was the summer before junior year. Yeah. You played Suzanne in the play that year. Right. It was my first lead. I remember how you made dad laugh. That song you sang. He was proud of you, you know. I was glad to share that with him. It was the last time he saw me on stage. He would of been proud of everything you did in New York. But he would of been proud you came home too. Flowers aren't as glamorous as acting, but just as beautiful. Plus dad loved the idea of us running a flower shop together. You know he really was a supportive guy. We probably didn't have to try so hard. Charles, do you take Cindy to be your wife? I do. You had a better chance of finding Mister Right in New York though. Everyone left here is technically our cousin. Wes Gently isn't our cousin. I haven't spoken to that man since high school and I was kind of a dork by then so. Maybe I'll ask him out then. Hey, don't even go there. He's mine. I'm kidding. And you're not a dork, you know. Wes would be lucky to have you. You may kiss the bride. I now pronounce them Husband and Wife.

Let's just wait and see who actually won. Looks like it's your lucky day. Who is that? I have never seen him before. You know what that means. I've never seen such artistic flower arrangements ladies. By the way, my birthday is next month. Good to know Michelle. Who's ready to party! Sorry I'm late. I had to make a couple calls. It's okay. Are you getting a little emotional Darryl? I'm so happy. They have ribs? Is that hickory? Excuse me. Maggie! You look beautiful. Thank you for coming. Congratulations! We don't have to shake hands here. See. Why can't you settle down with a nice woman like that? There's Wes. Go get him! Darryl! Ribs! Excuse me ladies. Excuse me. Ah, sorry ladies. I think this guy needs my attention. Tough crowd. I'm Ryan Roarke, head the legal team at All Star Talent. Wow, you guys don't give up do you. No we don't. Look, this contract is perfect for you. I wouldn't of flown halfway across the country if I didn't think so. I'm not interested. Thanks. You like singing, right? I suppose I do. And people like hearing you sing. Some say they do. Everyone says they do. They love your voice, they love your songs. Your music is real. It makes the people feel less alone. All I'm talking about is trying to get more people to listen to your music. Everyone's got the Internet, don't they? My song's right there. Look, I know being a hit singer wasn't on your to-do list. You're a single dad, right? Your son filmed the first video? Yeah. You know, he's still a little disappointed he hasn't got me a wife yet. We could do reality show. That will get you a wife. You'd kill the ratings. I'm just kidding. Look, you went viral. Why not capitalize on that? Why not just let this whole thing die and let me go back to being a rancher. Okay you could. What happens if the ranch doesn't work out? I'm a third generation rancher. Things have been going fine. Okay, what if you get injured or sick? Doesn't bode very well for the fourth generation. Wow, you're a cheery guy, Ryan. Cheery was not in the job description. Before this whole Internet thing dies down you should put a nest egg away for you and your son. You sound like my mother. Smart woman. Look you sign this contract, you're going to make a lot of money. Then you can go back to ranching whenever you want. Look around this room. I can ask anybody here for anything. And on a handshake I know exactly what I'm getting. Now I sign that big stack of papers you're offering me and I have no idea what you're going to do with me. Come on, you know I can't go forward on a handshake. That big stack of papers makes everything clear. Sorry. That's not how it works around here. Oh, there she is. Hey Wes. Who's your friend? There he is. I wonder why he's talking to Wes Gently? You bringing city folks around here again? No. This is Ryan. He's, he's from just west of here. I'm not a third generation. I talked to enough ranchers today. I need some barbecue. A rancher! From another town? Clearwater? Maybe New Town? Go talk to him. A deals a deal. This deal is structured for you. I bring projects to you and you tell me what you do and don't want to do. And then your firm just does all the work. For a ten percent fee. It's a drop in the bucket for what you're going to make. How do I look? You look like you're wasting your time with me. Go. Ask him to dance. Whoa! Honestly I don't know how you turn them away. Hi. - Krista Dalton. - Sorry? That's my name. You were going to ask me that, weren't you? Ryan Roarke. Would you like to dance, Ryan Roarke? I would, I'm just in the middle of something. When a pretty girl asks you to dance, you always say yes. He's right you know. It's just polite. And I only work with polite people. Oh. One sec. That's better. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to be rude. What were you trying to be? I'm trying to worry a little bit more about my job than a really beautiful woman. Really? I failed miserably. Well I hope you're better at ranching than you are dancing. Oh, I'm better at everything than dancing. Well don't look at your feet. Just look at me. Everything else will fall into place. There you go. I've always wanted to do that. So how do you know Wes Gently? Are you guys working together? No not yet. But I feel like we're going to be very shortly. What's all this work talk? I thought we were dancing. ♪ ♪ Where you going? We don't stop dancing until the music stops. Is something wrong? It's my girlfriend. I'm sorry I should have said something. No it's fine. I just got out of a relationship very recently so... You're right. We probably shouldn't be dancing together. You're not stopping. No, it appears that I'm not. I don't want to mess with your tradition. The one about you can't stop dancing until the music stops. It would be rude. Yeah, it would be. ♪ ♪ I'm starting to like this place. Are you? Would you like to see more? There's more? Of course there's more. It's a small town but it's not tiny. Here, I'll show you. You don't have anywhere to be, do you? No, not tonight. ♪ Country Music ♪ First stop on the tour is Dina's Diner. She makes the best chopped salads. And over there is the school. It's really small. It's where I learned to spell Mississippi. And it's also where I let a pig loose in the school to avoid taking a math test. - Really? - I hadn't studied. Have you been here your whole life? Yeah. My sister and I have. Our dad passed away when we were in high school and our mom remarried a couple years ago and moved overseas with our step dad. You must miss them. All the time. But I talked to my mom once a week and we see them once a year. This is the place that lives in the center of all our hearts. I did live in New York for awhile. - Really? - Yeah. What happened? The city wasn't for me. The people there they're always rushing and trying to get to the top of somewhere for some reason. Yeah, sounds familiar. But I became one of those people. The closer I got to the top, the less happy I was. I felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. And who are you? Just a regular girl. I doubt that. Anyway, it was such a cliche in the end. I missed home so much that I bought a one way ticket back. Yeah my life's a bit of a cliche too. We had a military dad so as soon as we started making friends, we had to move and eventually I just kind of gave up making friends and became super shy. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. My parents were great. And my sister was my best friend. That's sweet. My sister and I are super close too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Who do you think helped me let the pig loose? There's nothing quite like family. Yeah. For me family is not really something you're born into, it's more something you create. Like when my parents decided to adopt me and my sister, we all became family. Wow. That's really deep. Most guys I know just talk about cattle or trucks, not their feelings. So what about this guy you've broken off with? I guess you and him weren't perfect? Not even close. How about you? Are you dating the perfect girl? I don't think I want to be with the perfect person. Why? I want to be with someone that's real. Someone who takes risks and makes mistakes. And it should feel right, sitting around and talking or walking around. Like this? Yeah, like this. I also have a lot of trouble letting my guard down. I've met a lot of people in my life that wanted to use me for what I offer them than really care about me. So what's your favorite place? That's over here. And here we are. Forever Flowers. My sister and I are florists. We own it. I love getting to be creative. I can see that.

Honestly, I don't think I've ever met anybody who listens to me like you do. I'm sorry I took you away from Wes. When we started dancing I didn't even think about it. I'm just upset that I have to fly in a few hours. You got to. The ranch is calling. I never heard of it put that way but, okay, I guess. You missed your calling as a tour guide. Thank you. So, what do you think? Could you picture yourself living here? I don't know... Maybe. Give me your phone. Like it? It's pretty good. Although I think it'd look a lot better with you in it. It's a really nice photo. - Mind if I send it to myself? - Yeah, sure. Sounds like you got it. Yeah. I guess now I have your number. And I have yours. Good night. Good night. Now that was a wedding. My feet are killing me. So. Did you talk to Wes? Seriously? And fawn at his feet with all his admirers. No. He doesn't even know my name. I mean, what I would give to be a few inches taller and spicy. Well I like you just the way you are. Nice and sweet. Well at least someone appreciates me. And what about you and that guy you were dancing with? Ryan. He's completely charming in every way. But he has a girlfriend. And he's headed back to wherever he came from. Hmm. At least he wasn't a guy that wanted to cheat on his girlfriend. Maybe he's living proof they're still good guys out there. Too bad he's taken. I'll probably never see him again. If this Ryan guy has half a brain he will leave his girlfriend and come running back to you. You're the best sister ever. You can thank me by grabbing me a cookie. I can't! It's too far. I'm tired. Did you bring me back a tumbleweed? No not yet. The rancher wouldn't sign the contract. You'll come up with another approach when you're back tomorrow. I am back. I'm headed to the office. - When? - Now. Ryan! You should take the day off. We'll have to take out some of the big words. He's an old school guy. Ryan. I, I had no idea, I swear. Ah, ah, Ryan! I thought you weren't back until tomorrow... Amber, are you serious? Is this about your head shot? That was yesterday. Come on Doug. Come on. Do I have to? Okay. You had your chance, Ryan. And unlike you, Doug here, he keeps his promises. Right! Huh? She told me you broke up so I... Doug, everything about you is making this worse. Seven reminders, Ryan. What does that say? Huh? You don't support my life's work. You asked me twice. I need to be nurtured so that I can grow. Now, why, why did I fall in love with Doug? Oh, because he, he gives me wings. He lifts me up. He is my rock! Doug says my head shot is brilliant. And I asked him once. Look at my Doug. Look at him. He's just, he's... amazing and he's just so So... So... Successful! Oh! Wow! - Alright, let's go Doug. - Yes. It's getting a little crowded in here. Let's go. I'm sorry, man, we're... Sorry, seriously. Look. I'm sorry! Classy lady. I'm so sorry Ryan. She just walked in. And Doug was there. And I, I didn't... Whatever. Another model turned actress. It's such an LA cliche. See, this is why they say there are no original stories anymore. My fault for falling for it. It's not you. It's this town. Which is why I don't date anybody. Just take the rest of the day off. - Seriously? - Yeah. I can read these by myself. Well, I wouldn't argue with my boss because that would be unprofessional. Yeah. Please. See you tomorrow Ryan. Whoops! Hang up. Hang up. Hang up! Hello. Hello Ryan? Ryan, is that you? Hey Krista. How's it going? Hey, things are fine. Is everything alright with you? Yeah. Everything's all good with me. Why do you ask? Well, it sounded like you were yelling or something. No. But, hey, I am super busy at the office, so I'm going to have to let you go. Oh, alright. Are you sure everything's alright? Yeah. Everything's tip top over here. Okay.

I had no idea that you had kept them. You must miss being onstage? All the time. I loved it. With each character I played, I got to experience another life. Someone else's story.

Yes. What does that have to do with Thanksgiving? You need to walk right up to Wes and ask him to sit down and eat with you. Okay, the line to share a meal with Wes is as long as the line at the post office. And I'm not getting in it. Why do I feel like you're still angry with him? Because he ruined my prom dress. It's probably the nicest dress I'll ever own. You know it wasn't Wes that pushed you into the pond that night. Well, he was fooling around with my date. Yeah, and he lost his footing, bumping into you accidentally. Exactly. His fault. You like him. Of course I do. It's kind of a problem. Look at Wes Gently over there. Who? Acting like he knows more about the entertainment industry than Ryan. Huh? I ought to give him a piece of my mind. No baby. We talked about this. No more giving anyone a piece of your mind until after the baby's born. Darryl, wait here. Wait here? She's rolling up her sleeves. Oh no. This is happening. What is your problem with my brother? He's a fantastic lawyer from Los Angeles who's busting his butt trying to help you. Darryl, I'm not finished. Why do you have to be so stubborn? People sign contracts all the time. Well, not me. Are you afraid of words on paper? You tell him, Maggie. That's my wife! Thanks, baby. Now if you knew what was good for you, you would quit being ungrateful and you would sign the contract. She's the mother of my child. Wes! Sign the contract already! Okay, look, I... Just, just stop yelling at me in front of all these people. I... will read it. Deal? Deal. Deal. I wonder who Maggie's brother is? But if he's anything like she is, he's a force to be reckoned with. You're calling him. Now? Yeah, you heard the lady. How's my favorite baby doing? What? Sorry. Who's this? You're a business man so talk business. Ah, okay. Mr. Wes Gently. How are you? Are you ready to discuss the terms of the contract? I might be. Yes. Okay great. I will send it over and then we will have a call with the legal team. You know what? I'd rather see what kind of man I'm dealing with. Why don't you stop by the ranch next time you're in town. I can do that. Great. You know what? Make it next weekend. Next weekend sounds great. Happy? So happy. Did that just happen? That just happened. I'll go book a flight! ♪ ♪ Hello! Hi. Thanks for letting me stay again. Cut the chit chat. What's the plan? Okay so, Wes... Thank you. Okay so Wes wants me to go over and help him with two cord of firewood. So I'm going to head over there now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hold on. You can't just go waltz over there. Why not? Wes, asking you to help on the ranch? That means he's testing you. Okay. And? And. You have no idea what you're doing, do you? Okay. Not really. No. Alright. Let me give you some tips on how to blend in. First. Take off your hat when you enter someone's house. It's a sign of respect. I don't have a hat, but, okay. Second. Never complain no matter how hard the work is. And third. Leave any gate just the way you found it. And fourth. Never criticize a man's horse. Or dog. Sorry. It's just too cute. Well this isn't cute. It's important manly stuff. Sorry. Okay, so what you're saying basically is I just have to fake until I make it. Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you that I'm particularly good at it. I bet you are, Darryl. Okay, that's just insulting. You ever, you ever use an axe before? No. I didn't think so. Mr. Gently. Hey, it's the city boy. Glad you could make it. Many hands make light work. I need you to load this into my truck.

You know Wes thinks you look great. You have no way of knowing that. Except his jaw dropped when he saw you walk in. Sure. I'm just glad you came this year. It's time for you to stop avoiding Wes. Did you ask about the girlfriend? No not yet. I'm just so happy he came back. Obviously. You're glowing. I can't help it. You know, maybe he really is my perfect guy. Do you think he likes me? Well, he can't take his eyes off of you. - Maggie! - Hi! How you feeling? Ah, pretty good. But I'm, I'm ready. - Yeah. - I can imagine. So you know Ryan? Not very well. He's only my brother. - Brother? - Yeah. You must have two brothers? Not the last time I checked. At Thanksgiving you said your brother was a lawyer. He is. That's him. Ryan Roarke. Los Angeles lawyer to the stars. He's lead counsel at the biggest talent agency in the country. You mean he's not a rancher? A rancher. That's a really good joke. Ladies. No. He's not a rancher like Wes. He's representing him on a contract. So he's not from around here. Definitely not. He's probably just letting you think that so he can impress you. He's not super confident with women. It's a childhood thing. Did you hear that? He lied to me. I mean did he or were you just looking for what you wanted to see. He told me that him and Wes were going to be working together. On a contract just like Maggie said. Honestly, Krista, you have to start asking hard questions. After one date I know a guy's friends, family and his dog's middle name. A lawyer? A lawyer is not the worst career choice to make. I suppose I would have found out eventually. Well are you going to tell him that you figured him out? Actually, I have a better idea. Well, good luck. Ryan. Hi. Hey. So how'd you like to go for coffee tomorrow? Sure, I'd love to. Great. I'll take you for the best cup of coffee you've ever had. My place, around eleven? Yeah. Can't wait. Hi! I'm Ashley. You must be Max. Maxwell Gently. Thank you. You're welcome. You look like you like punch? It's fruity and fizzy. The perfect combination. I like it too. And do you know what else I like? Christmas. Yes, but I was actually talking about your movies. Nice setting, good sound. You're a real good director. Thanks! I tried hard. Want to help me with the next one? You could do the microphone and I could do the camera. Yeah I'd like that. You like my dad too? Yeah I like him too. Hi... Ashley. I see that Max has introduced himself to you. She knows a lot about making videos. I'm sure she does. She's a smart lady. She's pretty too, don't you think? I think she's very pretty. And that holiday dress. Just like the prom dress in high school, right? Umm. Sorry. Umm. Max, it's past your bed time. You should... I'm going to get him to bed. Have fun, Ashley. Wes Gently just said my name. Twice. Merry Christmas to me. - Hey you! - Hi. So. How do you feel about Christmas decorations? I feel good about Christmas decorations. Good, because I love Christmas and I was thinking you could help me get mine out of storage. Sure. Since you do a lot of heavy lifting as a rancher it shouldn't be much work for you. Of course. I lift heavy stuff all the time. Great. Come this way. My favorite. Feeling exhausted yet? I got to tell you something. I'm not a rancher. I know you're not a rancher. I was just trying to have a little fun with you. Maggie told me everything. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Don't worry. Do you want to see something cool? Sure. My Mrs. Claus. Where's Santa? I couldn't find the matching Santa. She's vintage. You can't have Mrs. Claus without Santa. That's a crime against Christmas. Well there's a Santa out there for her somewhere. I'll find him. Don't worry. Good. Nobody should be alone on Christmas. Should we go for that cup of coffee? Sure. Thank you. Oh, that is good. You deserve it. What would your girlfriend think of all the work you did for me? Ah, we're actually not together anymore. Listen, I'm really sorry I let you think I was a rancher. I should've been honest from the start. I was wondering why you weren't. When we met you said you hated big cities like New York and Los Angeles so I was okay with letting you think I was from somewhere else. It's just nice feeling like a normal person for once. I was the one being dishonest when normally it's the other way around. So, who's the real Ryan Roarke? Um, I do live in Los Angeles. I'm ambitious. That's actually why I'm here in the first place. I'm going to sign Wes Gently to a contract. Nobody's been able to do it yet. And you think you can. And what else? I'm a baseball fan. I hate spinach. No matter what you put it in, I will find it. And, uh, I like you. Honestly, since we met I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. I really like you too. No matter what you do for a living. Krista. Krista. Are there Christmas lights in the barn? Krista! Can you come down from the clouds please. Seriously, you haven't come up for air in like a week. I'm sorry. I just can't stop thinking about Ryan. I've never felt this way before. I'm in love. Love? Isn't that a bit fast? I know. But I can't explain it. It just feels right. I'm happy for you sis. See! Sunshine yellow. It's amazing. Am I right? It is the best colour I've ever seen. Right Ryan? What about butter biscuit? I'm kidding. The kid's going to love it. What's Krista doing tonight? She's gone with her sister tonight and then I'm going to take her out tomorrow night. Are you taking her to Steve's Steaks? Is it good? They got steak. Well I guess now that you've sold me on it, I have to take her there, right? Yup. Ah! Look who I found! Buddy the Bunny! I knew he was around somewhere. Mom and dad gave me this box a few years ago. I wanted our baby to have something from the family. This guy takes me back. Yeah, and, uh, she also gave me this. Grandma Roarke's ring! - Yeah. - Wow. Mom gave it to me but I want you to have it. Me? I don't think it will fit me. For Krista! Look, I've never seen you happier. I know you love Krista. If you're trying to hide it, you're not doing a very good job. Is it that obvious? Yeah. Listen, I'm not saying now but... Here. She's the girl you've been waiting for Ryan. Krista is real. So is this place and the way that you feel. You know I'm right. When the time is right for you, give her this. I just, I created such a life back home. There's so much there. It's everything I've ever wanted. Sometimes you spend your life working toward a goal. When you finally reach it you realize the goal needs to shift. It's time you start working towards what really makes you happy, Ryan. Okay. What has gotten into you? I know Steve Steak's wasn't that good. I have a big surprise for you tonight. I kind of have a surprise for you too, actually. Look, Krista, I think me and you should start talking about... Wait here. What is up with you? What is this place? Okay, wait here for ten minutes and then come inside. Okay. You'll like it. I swear. Okay. Krista, what are we doing here? Surprise! I don't get it. I got a lead part in A Christmas Carol! I'm so excited. - You did? - Yeah. I know you think that I'm just some farm girl but... This is the real me. I've always loved acting and I decided I want to start again. Again? So that's why you were in New York. You were an actor. Yeah. And I was good. You're an actor. Yeah. And I would love for you to be sitting in the front row on opening night. I thought you didn't care about fame and attention. What? Look, I've dated actors. I'm not just your golden ticket to get out of here and go to Hollywood. I thought you were different. I thought you cared about me and not just what I do. Ryan, this is about me not giving up on myself. This is about something that I need to have back in my life which, believe it or not, includes you. I'm in love with you. I open up and you're really just going to stand there and pretend you don't feel the same way? I don't even know what to say to you. Ryan! - Hey! - Hi! Who's calling you? It's not who you think it is. Hi Max. Hi Ashley. Are you having punch? No, but I miss its fizzy fruitiness. You're funny! You're funny too. My dad wrote a new song. I know he'd like to sing it for someone. Well, I'm a good listener. Want to come over and do the microphone? Sure. Anytime. Okay, I'll ask my dad for permission. Wait, he's smiling so I think that's permission. I'll call you back. Max? Yeah, we're buddies. Here, let me help. Thank you. It always looks better when you do it. Are you sure you want to go through with this? I mean you've just been so upset lately. I want to see it through. For me. You're right. I had given up on myself for far too long. I'm happy that I'm doing this. I'm fine. Are you sure? Of course. Okay. I'll go get you your costume. Hi again Ashley. Hi Max. Could I talk to your dad for a second? Sure. Hello. Wes. This is totally random but have you sent that contract off to Ryan yet? Um, no, actually. But I'm going to the post office tomorrow morning. Great. Can I ask you for your help? It's for my sister. Yeah. It would make my day. Hey what's up? Now I've noticed you've been a little mopey lately. So you thought you would come in to interrupt me? Yeah. I can read auras, and yours is sort of a red green kind of swirly thing. This sounds like it's worth my time. Like Christmas colors, but sadder. So I have something that will cheer you up. We just got the amendments from Wes Gently and they all look very doable. Looks like he's going to sign. Good. Let's get those off to the partners by the end of the day. Will do. This was addressed to you personally. Why don't you come out with us after work tonight? I'm okay, thanks. But you don't have to go to Rust Creek Falls anymore, I mean that's a reason to celebrate, isn't it? We can handle Wes' affairs from here. Yeah, I just got a couple things I got to finish up. Okay. But the next time we sign a grumpy online star, the drinks are on you. Deal. Okay. So I have a callback. And I want to be my best. Well, let's hear it then. Okay. I'm ready. That was it. What? That was... Fear. I'm scared. Oh yes! Wow, that was convincing! You are amazing! You, you are going to get it, for sure. - Oh thanks. - No doubt whatsoever. You have given me sunshine. Ah, you're such a gift. That's why I'm going to give you a gift. - Oh. - Uh huh. Just one for now. Urgent. Attention Ryan Roarke. Rising star rejects fame, fortune, footlights. Krista Dalton announces retirement. Theater fans upset at losing the most talented stage actor of her generation. Hey Maggie. What's up? Not much. Just hanging out with our new baby boy. You have a nephew. You weren't due for two weeks! I know. He was really excited to meet his uncle. He came really quickly so I didn't have anytime to call. Plus, I was a tad bit busy giving birth. Maggie! He's beautiful! What did you name him? Ryan. Just like his uncle. Thank you so much. He's clearly the best Ryan out of all of us. Look at that little face. He's got my nose. He's got my biceps, right buddy? No, he doesn't Darryl. He's just a baby. He's great Darryl. You must be proud. I am. But I'm more proud of my beautiful wife. So. Have you talked to Krista? No I haven't. Ah, you know what? I'm going to send you a gift basket. What do you need? - Diapers? - No no no no. I might have just given birth but you're not getting away that easily. Maggie... You listen up, okay? She is the mother of my child. Look who. Grrrr! Grrrr! Grrrr! Thanks honey. Could you get me a glass of water, please? Sure. Of course, sweetheart. So why haven't you talked to Krista? Look, my last three relationships have gone the exact same way. Hey I like you. Guess what? I'm an actress, make me famous. Then I end up getting dumped and I binge-watch reality shows while eating cheesecake. You liked her when she was just a country girl. And she liked you when you were just a rancher. So somewhere in that mess of emotions are just two people who are scared that they won't be loved for who they are. You need to work this through with her. Talk to her. I know it's just... It's nothing. You're a hotshot Hollywood lawyer. Pretty girls are throwing themselves at you because of your money and your job. I wanted Krista to be different. She is different. So she's an actor. She's also real. She's not interested in your money or fame, not from Broadway and not from you. Trust me. Krista, she's the type of woman that you want to settle down and start a family with. You make it sound so easy. Well, love is complicated. Yeah but when you stop thinking about it and start listening to your heart, it's simple. Hey Chris! I need you to book one more flight. Uh huh. See. Your mom is a smart lady. Yes she is. You're going to meet your uncle. Yes you are. - Here sweetie. - Thank you. ♪ ♪ Will you stop! You're making me nervous. Okay. Sorry. What do I do? Well you say will you marry me. That's what I did. It's not that easy, honey. Why not? Well, because Ryan has to prove to Krista that, one, he's genuinely sorry for accusing her of using him, and two, that she should spend the rest of her life with someone who just broke her heart. Oh, well. Do that then. I can't just show up at her house! I acted like such an idiot. She probably wouldn't even let me in. Look, she's not even home. She's performing in the Christmas play tonight. I got to do something big. Something that's going to win her back. Is that a Santa suit? Yeah. Darryl borrows it from St. Nick every year for the school play. Yeah, I like to do my part in the community. And, candy canes are free. Can I borrow it? Sure. Yeah. The big guy needs it back by Christmas Eve. The shadow of the things that would have been, May be dispelled. I know they will. I was light as a feather. I was happy as an angel. I was merry as a schoolboy. Why can't every story have a happy ending? I wish. Shouldn't you be at a mall or something? Ryan? Ready to change the ending? You better believe it. Come with me. Why it's Scrooge come knocking on our door. Merry Christmas to you and to your family. It appears another has come knocking on our door this Christmas Day. Ho ho ho! Santa, what are you doing here? I came to tell you what I want for Christmas. But Santa, don't you give presents to the children? Nonsense! What about Santa's wishes? Oh! Ryan! I'm so sorry. I was so blinded by my own fear that I couldn't see the real you. I love you Krista. Aww! - Will you marry me? - Are you crazy? I'm crazy about you. And I was crazy for ever leaving here. But my eyes and my heart are more open now than they've ever been. This is all I want. Me and you. You want to move here, with me. There's enough ranchers here, right. So how about a lawyer for a change? So, Krista Dalton... Will you marry me? Well, I wouldn't want Santa to be without his Mrs. Claus. Yes Ryan Roarke. I will marry you. Ask her. Now. Hey! Ashley. Um. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Umm. No. Ah... I have something I've got to say to you. I'm sorry about the prom dress back in high school. I, ah, I didn't mean it. And, ah, I was wondering if you would like to have dinner with me, sometime. I would love to. Really? That's great. Um, I don't know if you knew this but back in high school I was, I was kind of sweet on you. - Really, me? - Really, you. I like you too, Wes. And Max is quite the matchmaker. I'm the best. Yeah, you're the best buddy. Hi Guys. Max. Nice to see you again. Why don't we get together sometime and we can sign that contract. Let's worry about that big stack of papers later. - Merry Christmas. - You too. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Well, you might not be a rancher, but for a lawyer, you fit right in. Oh, so you like lawyers now? I love this lawyer.
