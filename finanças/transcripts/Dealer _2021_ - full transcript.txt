What d'you want? - Two. Hey, want some blow? Some blow? Want some blow? All desire. And pain. And fear. Fear. Fear. Hey, kid. - Hey. I'm off. And, with all that, what we call love is just... impossible. Just incomprehensible. Yet it exists. Eh? Yeah? - It exists, I can feel it does. I can feel it. Thanks. See you next time. Hilde, yeah. Great acting, eh? You're never bored. But I'm wondering what the message is, what's being said. I reckon the director hasn't got much to say. He's just entertaining the audience with caricatures. I can see it in his eyes. It's in scene 1 when they deliver those letters. It's in scene 2 when they're sitting round the table. I think to myself, I'm not stupid, I saw it. You're not serious? - I am. Hey, Mathieu, one for me too, one for me too. Hi, kid. You alright? - Yeah. And you? You lost something. You can have it back if you buy me a beer. - Buy you a beer? Go on, get the kid a beer. Mathieu, another one. You can't do that. Want to buy some? - Buy some what? Blow. - Blow? What's that? - Sorry, but how old are you? Seventeen. And yon? - No way, don't believe you. Can you take a photo of him and me? - Hey, kid. Mind your manners. Come on, come here. What's your name? - Siegfried. Smile. Tony. Smile. Here you go, guys. - Yes. A beer for the kid or what? No, give here. - Hey, OK. Yes! Great guy. Hey, cheers. - Great kid. Tony, have you got another twenty? Put it on my bill. I saw it. Mathieu, he took my wallet. - You're joking. Hey, you crazy idiot. Hey! Has someone got my phone? - Oh, come on. Hey! Hey, you bastard. - Hey! Hey! - Come here, you little shit. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. What have you been up to now? The judge isn't going to like this, buddy. Could be back to the detention centre again for you. Johnny. You're lucky. They're letting you go. I can go? - The victim isn't pressing charges. D'you menu it? - You got lucky this time. Don't let me see you back in here any time soon or I'll get your mother to come in. Right. Party time. See you later. - Take care, kid. Pussies! Suck my dick... Can you get me some blow? Now? - Yes. You're in luck. How much d'you want? Give me six. How fast can this car go? 220, 240. How much did it cost? I don't know. You don't know? You didn't buy it yourself? No, I was given it. - No... Yes. Awesome! You were given it just because you're famous? Sponsorship. Right, here you are. That's not enough. Yeah, well... - That's not enough, bro. What are you going to do? Pinch my wallet again? Fucker. Let's get cruising. - I will if you ask nicely. You ripped me off, buddy. So get cruising, now. Please, brother. I'm your brother? I didn't know that. When's the family reunion? Don't be a dick, fatso. Get cruising. - Fatso? Hey you! Please, Mr Ophoff. Can you please get cruising? That was polite. - Thank you, go go. Right then, hold on tight. - Right. Hi, babe. I know it's late but... I just had to call you. You know me, eh? It's because I love you so much. What are you up to? Sleeping probably. Maybe we could go away for a weekend. To Rome or somewhere. To that little hotel you love going to. I'm in Belgium for a while now so... If you fancy it let me know. See you soon. Mum. You're home for a change. - I've brought something to eat. Here, Mum, eat. Did you get any sleep, Mum? - Sleep? Sleep, sleep. I'll get some sleep when I'm dead. You have to sleep, Mum. - We have to do lots of things. But I don't hold with all that. What's that called? - That? Her. She's Deianira. A Greek goddess. Her guy cheated on her with all and sundry so she got his clothes, soaked them in poisoned blood and he died as a result. A very painful death. It was his own fault. Where did you sleep last night? - At Youssef's. He's a good guy. Why don't you sleep here? - I do sleep here. Not now you don't. Is it because there aren't any curtains? No. If the home finds out you don't sleep here, you won't be allowed out anymore. Fuck that. - Fuck that, fuck that. Is that all you kids can say now? It's all I ever hear. Here, a pastry. - Don't want it. You do. - I don't want revolting pastries. But you like them. Take it. How was school? - Fine. There's this real retard. Plays the man at school but I knocked him right off his feet. Why d'you always fight? - I don't fight. But if others start I fight back. - Fighting is for the weak. Not true. - Not true? So why do you fight? Eh? Because you can't handle it. That's nice, that blue. - Thanks. Here, Mum, go and buy some food. I have to go back. I'm off. - Already? You've only just got here. I have to be back inside by six. Next time there'll be curtains up and I'll get some rolls. OK? - Yes. Come here. Pay, bitch. Bro, you're being screwed up the arse in my hotel. Hey. you're on my hotel, aren't you? 7,200. Here, here, here. Pay. Why is it always me? You lot are at it again, I see. Guys, this is Yousra. She's coming to live with us for a bit. Be gentle, eh? - Come and sit here. Can I have one of yesterday's desserts? - Yon had one yesterday and one today too. Go on, play. - Bro, play. Hey, play. - Hey, I know him. No, not him, the other one. I know him. - No way. Play. Hey, here, here, here. - Stop lying. Antony Ophoff? Here, come and see. - Is that Antony Ophoff? That's fake, man. How d'you manage that? - He's my friend. Your sex buddy. - Sex buddy? Want a thump? What? - Como on, come on, come on. Take it easy. Hey! Hello! Let go, let go. Calm down. - You faggot. Can we go watch that film? - If you behave. Without these pussies. - Who's a pussy? I'm too rich anyway. Here, here. "So, what do you like to do?" "I like football and stuff." "Oh, football." "I knew nothing about that." That's a real conversation killer. What do bitches know about football? Nothing. They know as much about football as a fucking pineapple. So then you need to ask a question. Show you're interested. You have to listen and stuff. Pussies like questions. Go on, ask me a question. Go on, ask a question. - Wanna fuck? Be serious, dude. I'm being serious. It's fucking good advice. Fucking advice like that normally costs you. Now you have to ask a question. "What do you like to do?" And everything she thinks is sick you think is sick too. So... "I like going to see a movie and stuff. And I like good music." A movie, there's your first move. "I like going to see a movie too." What can you ask then? - What can you ask? "Want to go and see a movie with me?" - Oh. Smart Einstein here has got it. Eh? Get it? And then you fuck. You fuck her, get it? What are you doing? It's like you're fucking a rabbit. He's fucking Bugs Bunny. - Eh... What's up, doc? Hey, listen, listen, listen. I haven't finished yet. You gotta watch out. Never fall in love. Make sure you call the shots, always. Cos there are some fucking sick bitches out there. Once they've got your heart in their hands, you're fucked. D'you know how crazy the Moroccan ones are? They go crazy with little virgins. I'm not a virgin. - What are you going to do? Here. What, what, what? Hey. Look, look, look. Think that's OK, or what? What is that? What the fuck is that? Look at his face. Did you see his face? Eh? Look at his fucking face. Did you shit yourself? I'm only joking, eh? Johnny, pick that up. Come on. OK, Youssuf, how many grams have you got? Thirty. - Give him some of yours. Everyone should have fifty. - Here's some of mine. I need some too. - OK, everyone got fifty? Count them. I've got fifty. - OK, move. Alright, let's go. - Alright. Alright, let's go, boys. This man goes to thump me, then suddenly he gets a message from God. Bro, I hit him three times. - Three bitch slaps with his skinny arms. You've got a lot to say for yourself. - Here, muscles... You're thin as a rake. Hey, did you just fart? The small one just farted. - What did you say? I didn't fart. Ugh, man, you stink. You remind me of a character from a crap TV comedy series, you do. Moroccans love watching crap TV series. And Belgians don't, or what? Can I buy a gram? - Not here. Is it good stuff? - Not here, junkie. Wait by the metro. Give here. Wow, wow. Check this, buddy. Look. If I had that I'd get to lay all the chicks. Yeah, till you open your window and they see your ugly face. What ugly face? I'm being serious. - Come on. Hey, Mr Ophoff, how's things? - Oh, Mr Wallet. Watch your pockets, guys. Come to broaden your mind? We were in the neighbourhood. Want some blow? Got some on you? - Yes. Got a lot on you? - Enough. What are you lot going to do? - We're going somewhere. We'll come with you. Oh yeah? Will you? OK. Party or what? - Hey, Tony, are you serious? You don't have to come, eh? Come on. - I'm not cleaning up any mess. Won't be any, pal. - I know you. I'll take you somewhere but you mustn't tell anyone. My lips are sealed. The drugs are here. Look. At last. Why did it take so long? - Had a performance to do, sweetie. What's your name? - Johnny. Johnny? Got yourself a new little friend, or what? I swear. No one ever knew what her surname was. She was just Sabine. Sabine from the club. Look, he's gonna spin out. Anyway, how's your girlfriend? I haven't got one. - How come you haven't got one? Oh, wow. Interaction between us and the nightlife, the party scene is fake. That's nice, eh? It's OK. It's OK. Can you fuck her because you're famous? All desire and pain. And tasty pussies. Desire and pain, kid. Got your hands off me. - Hey, what are you doing? Get off. - What are you doing? You can get out too. - Take your hands off. The kid was in a room he had no business to be in. What did you do? - Nothing. He had something that wasn't his. They're leaving. Him too. - He's with me. Yeah, I'm with him. - Choose your friends more carefully. Choose yours more carefully. You've got none. Don't touch me. Or I'll thump you. - Yeah... I'll smash your head in. - Yeah. Fuck you. Come on. Johnny, let's go. No, I'm staying here. - Staying here? Come on. I'm staying. Calm down. Fuck you. - Don't make such a drama out of it, bro. Your friends need to know when to behave. He's not always like that. Well, he was now. It'll be fine. - Only because it's you. Oh. fuck. Bummer for you, man. Right. - Bummer for you. Fuck you, you bastard. Fuck you. Fucking fuck-up. - Johnny. I want to see your play. My play? - Yes. Are you interested in the theatre? - Yes. It's not like Drake, games and YouTube crap. Without good art, without real beauty, society gets sick, you know. My mother is an artist. Your mother is? Really? Eva De Wouwer. Eva De Wouwer? The painter? Is she your mother? Do you know her? Yeah. From before. From the clubbing scene. And I know some of her work. Seriously? - Yes, she makes some nice stuff. She's working on a series about Greek gods at the moment. Those gods are sick. They fuck their kids and murder their parents. Does your mother teach you that? - Yes, my mother is smart. She's so fucking smart it screws up her brain. I want to act too. Do you? Why? - I want to be famous. You don't need to act to be that. I want to be in movies. In Hollywood movies or what? Every moron wants to be in Hollywood movies. Their Mecca. Career, career, career. All Fred Astaire. Fuck that. And lots of fucking bitches. Let me tell you something, gangster. Just cos everyone knows you, you drive a flash car, have got lots of dough it doesn't mean you're not a stupid wanker. A dickhead is still a dickhead. Even if he's good at hiding it. I can act too, you know. You wanna fuck with me? Uh? You wanna play rough? Say hello to my little friend! OK. Good stuff. Come on. Mum, come and sit down. The one of Florence. He thought that was good. That one will sell. That one will sell. Is that nice? Want some wine? - No. I'm pouring myself a drink and you haven't got one. Here, just a drop. Yummy chips, eh? - Yeah. Mum, my father, is he an actor? What are you going on about now? I don't know. Why not? Your father was a loser. You know that. Why can't I know who he is? - Because he doesn't want you to. Why not? He didn't want you, see? I've already told you. I kept you against his will. Why can't you tell me who he is? - Because I can't. You'll look for him and you mustn't. It says so in a contract. And then I'll go to jail. OK? Is that what you want? But who will know you told me? I won't tell anyone. Things are going to happen. Good things. My work will sell and we'll go and live in a house in the South of France. In the sun. Eh? We'll have animals, count the butterflies, make our own bread. All that. You know. Fresh air, in the countryside. You and me. Get it? Eh? Look at me. Look at me. Do you still love me? Yes. Do you still love me? - Yes. Stop it. Come on. You've put water in it. - To the South of France. Come on. I don't drink wine. - Hey... Sir. Use that steel wool pad, it's much quicker. I doubt it. - Here, go on. Hey, what... Hey, what are you doing? Come on. Here, here, here. I'm Wizard Bubble Beard. Bubble bubble pop pop. Bubble bubble. - Don't mess about. I'll stick my hat up your arse. - What did you say? Not yours, eh? - I should hope not. I have respect for ladies. - Respect? You're letting me do it all. Come on, you do something too. - What? You can do the drying up. Get the tea towel. Watch this. I can dry up the whole world in a second with my drying up skills. See, done. That's how to do it. - Look, it's still wet. That's not wet. There's just some foam on there. It'll dry. Do you like the theatre? - I don't know. I've never been. Fancy coming with me to watch a friend? To the theatre? - Yes. Yes, OK. Art is good for your health. What? Can't manage it? Are you retarded? Fasten the fucking belt. I've got a brick of coke in here. Find it and I'll give you a raise. In here? - Yes. Aren't they coming too? - No, they're staying here. Go on. Go on, boy, go on. I love you, baby. I really do. I love you, I want you to know that. But I can't let people fuck with me. Understand? You can't just abandon Youssef like that. We're brothers. We don't abandon each other. OK? And I heard that's what you did. OK? I can't just let you get away with it, can I? Eh? I can't let people fuck with me, can I? Right, come on. Hug. Love is standing. Love is looking. Love is... bleeding. Love is cutting into your own skin. Love is hitting. Love is... Mummy. Mummy? Yes, son? Where is Emma? She doesn't want to see you anymore. Where are my kids? Where are my kids?! Congratulations. Well done. It was a great evening. Fantastic, that abstract cloud... This is Koen. That abstract... Is Antony Ophoff really a friend of yours? Yes. - Seriously? Yeah, watch me. Yeah, it's really does something. It's a confront... - Here he is. Good seats? Yes. in the middle. - That's good. Who is this young man? - This is my son Benjamin. Your son? I had no idea. Hello, Benjamin. You can be proud of your dad. - My dad's good, eh? Yes, your dad's good. I need to go to the toilet. You too, Benjamin? Yes, me too, Dad. Well done again. Thank you. - Excuse us. Bye. Here. Did you like it? - Yeah, man, you're really nuts. Yeah? - Uh-huh. Did you get it? - I'm not stupid, eh? But why doesn't that guy just say that to his wife? That's what the whole play is about. - He creates lots of drama that way. Mankind... Will you come and say hello to someone? Come and say hello to who? - A girl, my friend. Your girlfriend? - No, no. Have you...? - Maybe. Or is Johnny still a virgin? - No way, buddy. You're a pro or what? - Yeah, I teach others. No, no, I've got respect for this girl. Yeah, you should respect girls. - She's great. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Come on, Johnny. Antony, why are you calling me? Now? Then the cunt comes and asks if you enjoyed it. Then she comes and asks... if you enjoyed it while you've still got food in your mouth. I've brought some stuff. They all pretend to be considerate. But they aren't considerate. They aren't considerate. Sit down. Can you see me? - Yeah. No. Can you see me? I don't think so, Johnny. I don't think so, lad. I'm a piece of shit, Johnny. And one day they are all going to realise. Antony Ophoff is a piece of shit. What do you mean? You've got everything everyone dreams of. Do you think so? Do I look like a dream? Have a line. Don't lie to me. D'you want a smoothie? Sure. - OK. Is that nice? I'll stop using and you'll stop dealing. What d'you reckon? If you do it, I'll do it too. Yes? Or no? Let's throw our blow down the loo. - Hey, give it back. Give it back. Don't, give here. Give it back, don't. Don't. Stop. Stop. Fucking fuckwit. What the fuck, retard? How much will it cost? - At least 1,500. Here. 2,000. Sold everything. - Everything? Everything too. I'm thinking of quitting this. Quitting what? - This. This? What will you do? Go and work at the baker's? As the guy who hands me my bread? No, act. - Act? Sir is friends with Antony Fuckoff and thinks he's the man. D'you know what acting is? You can hardly read. He's going to help me. This Antony? - Yeah. D'you think he's better than us cos he's a bit famous? It's not about that. D'you think you'll get rich acting? I don't know. Quit? You don't know what it's like out there. It's fucked up. Hey. Don't expect us to help you out when you need us. Out is out. Go on, piss off. I can go? Piss off. Want me to kick you out? Go on, go and act the bitch out there. Anyone else got any good ideas? Mum, stop. Stop. What are you doing? No, don't. Mum, stop. Mum, stop. Stop, don't. Got a grip, stop, don't. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop. Stop. You need to get some sleep, Mum. Get some sleep. I'll send it like that. They may want it then. Calm down. Calm down. Don't be afraid. Angels are protecting us. We can't die. We've known each other in former lives. Did you know that? You were my husband in a previous life. It's not so bad. Don't be afraid of life. This is just an in-between phase. Here, take this, Mum, then you will sleep. I'm here for you. I know, Mum. Sleep. It'll be OK. Woohoo! It's something else, eh buddy? - This is sick, man. Beautiful, eh? Would you like to perform here too? - Yeah, man. Then you'll have to learn to speak. - What d'you mean? Articulate. - I can articulate, man. I'm the best articulator in the whole world. In the whole city, you mean? - The whole world. What the fuck? - Look what I've got. Seriously? - Chill, eh? Here, look. Here, here. Look at that. You a pro or what? - Your mother's a pro, bitch. It just happened. I happened to be in that spot. You don't know them. - I do, I do. You wanted to learn to act. - I can do Scarface. No, not Scarface. Hold on. Be careful. Hey, look at that. - Wow. You do want to be in that film? - Yeah. If you're good, I can put you forward for the part. Really? Awesome. Hold on. I'll do it. No, you don't know your lines. Leave me alone. "Leave me alone" is the attitude of an amateur. Hey, why are you throwing things? Here, take that. It just happened. I happened to be in that spot. They don't usually notice me but now they do. But I have nothing to do with it. You're not on the street. You're talking to your girlfriend. Look at her and say it. Mean it. Just say it. Put one foot on it, then the other one and cruise. Hold my hand. - Look. Look. I'm the king. I feel a bit of a pussy. Pussy is good. Pussy is OK. And now speak nicely. It just happened. I just happened to be in that spot. They don't usually notice me but now they do. It's nothing to do with me. Hi, darling. I'm looking after a kid at the moment. A good kid. Soon, when you're less busy, I'll introduce him to you. I'm not so busy at the moment so we could do stuff. When you've got time, call me. Don't wait too long to call me, eh? I'm your sugar, your one and only. You know that, don't you? Kiss kiss. I miss you. See you soon. Oh, missed. Come on, loser. - Here I am. Come on then, dude. Hey, timeout. No, no timeout. - Hey, what are you doing? Can you come with me? - Did I do something? No, you just have to come with me. - The shit's hit the fan... The shit's hit the fan... - Here. I've got some unfortunate news. Your mum's in hospital again. Since when? - This morning. Psychosis. They had to section her. Am I still allowed out at the weekend? You know that's difficult if your mum is in hospital. You can go out during the day but have to be back in time for dinner. And then you feel it. There you go. And then you've got this. What do I have to do at the audition? Like we've practised. I can't just wheedle you a part in the film. They have to see what you can do. I know. I'll kill it, man. I'm not allowed out at the weekend. - How come? What have you done now? My mother is in hospital again. In hospital? - A psychiatric one, with psychosis. I'm not allowed out while she's in there. Unless I have a guardian I can stay with at the weekend. Oh yeah? Yeah. What kind of rule is that? - I have to stay with a responsible adult. A responsible adult? - Yes. And that can be anyone? - Yes. Bummer. I'll be your responsible adult. - Are you serious? Don't lie to me. - Why not? Don't fuck with me. Seriously? I can stay with you at the weekend? If you behave. - Wow, I'll be on my best behaviour. Right then. Are we going to eat this at your place too? If you want to. It just happened. I happened to be in that spot. They don't usually notice me but now they do. But I have nothing to do with it. Those are the lines. Did you see me acting, Mum? And the home is fine with this? They've visited his place and it's been approved. Antony is a decent guy. He's a big bastard, for all we know. It'll be fine, Mum. You've got a nice room. You can go home soon. That Wendy is such a dork. Do you think she's hot? No. - I wouldn't want to be her. I'd hit her. A right dork. "No. Peter, don't." Don't what? Tiger Lily is cooler. She got what Peter Pan was all about. He was her dream baby. Hmm. - That Wendy is a right dork. I'd be Captain Hook, only smarter. - What? Not Peter Pan? Don't you want to fly and stuff? He's free, get it? Captain Hook is loaded, though. - Peter Pan's got a whole island. I guess. - Peter Pan is better. And a lot smarter. Peter Pan wears a skirt. - What's wrong with that? It's OK, it's OK. Shotgun? - Yeah, OK. Oh, man. You're my dream baby. - And you're my sweetheart. You're a good kisser. I hope you haven't kissed too many boys before me? I asked you something. - Get over yourself. Are there lots of people at an audition? There can be, it varies. It'll be OK. Got any more tips for me? Yeah, don't do your best. - Right. I'm already feeling stressed. It'll be OK. So you can get in later. But just you, none of your crazy mates. OK? No fucking about, eh? - Really? I'm not waiting for you to come home every time. But no arsing around. - No, no. OK. You'll be fine. - Yeah? Of course you will, boy. - Of course. I'll kill it. Hey, Johnny. Remember me? - How's things? Get in. We'll go for a drive. - I can't. I have to be somewhere. Come on, just for a drive. - I can't. I have to be on time. Feel too good for us now, do you? Are you going to start too? Get in. How's things, kid? Are you living with that celebrity these days? No. How's the acting going? Eh? Famous yet? Earned loads of money? Oh, you know. - Yeah? I can act too. I can fucking outact everyone if I have to. Don't you believe me or what? Sure, but I really do have to... Fucker. What are we going to do? You'll see. Go on, get out. Come here. Here, film me. Hey, film me. Are you filming me? Come here, you fucking bastard. Come here. Fucking... Here, here. Come on. Come fucking here. Here, motherfucker. Motherfucker. Flicking... Youssef thinks I'm a retard. - That's not true. Luca, please. Come on, get up. Got up. Hey, get up. Take your fucking clothes off. - It wasn't fucking much. Clothes off! - Luca. Take your fucking clothes off. Hey, keep filming. You're going to start acting and you think you can pinch my dope or what? It wasn't fucking much. - Wasn't fucking much. Clothes off! I was going to give it back. Come on, you're paranoid. - Paranoid? Oh, right. I get the impression you two don't take me seriously anymore. I do. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's you not taking me seriously. I really can't. I'm a friendly guy, aren't I? I'm a friendly guy. Eh? So why do you two treat me like a fucking retard? Fuck. Come here. - Fuck, come on. Luca, don't. No, Luca, no. Don't, Luca. Luca, don't. Luca, no. - Don't do it again. Luca! Right, now we're friends again. OK? You have respect for me. I have respect for you. Come on, get his clothes. Hey, Johnny, get in. You can find your own way home. Here. I want you to deliver that to a guy. In two hours' time, in the park. He'll give you some cash. Then you can go and act. Go on, piss off. Hey. - I've come for the audition for the film. It's just finished. Oh, fuck. I really can't help being late. May I quickly have a go? Come on. This is Johnny. - Ah Johnny, I've heard of you. You OK? Yeah. - Are you ready? OK, let's start then. - OK. Could you take your cap off? That's it. Could you take your backpack off too? Do I have to? - It would be good if you did. Give here. - It's fine. I'll just put it... - It's fine. Go on then, explain. Look, it just happened. I just happened to be in that spot. They don't usually see me but now they do. But I've got nothing to do with it. That's what they all say. - I mean it. I haven't. You just want to get off lightly. - I don't want to get off anything. Really? So why are you lying? - I'm not. You liar. You dirty rotten liar. Do you want to be a loser all your life? Stuck where you are cos you're a loser and a liar? I'm not a liar and I'm not a loser. And I won't let you fuck this up. Great, thanks. Bye. Give here. - My money? Don't be stupid. The backpack. Hi, sweetheart. Call me back when you've got time. I miss you. Tony, what? I miss you. No. Do you? I'm with someone else now, Tony. Have been for a while. As you well know. We are great together. - Were. You don't need me. Now what? Can't we find those guys? But you didn't see them. - No. I can hardly look for someone you didn't see. It's not my fault. So what do you suggest? - What d'you mean? Going to start selling again? - Selling? Until your debt is paid off. - It's not my debt. That's not the way it works, boy. I have to pay my bills too. You're the one who lost it. See? Yes. - D'you see? Yes. Want me to beat you up like I did Youssef? - No. Just sell a bit and you'll earn it just like that. OK. Hug. Come on. Here, the best there is. - No, thanks. Come on, man. Here, take it. kid. - No. Here. Put it in your mouth. Inhale, inhale. Suck, suck. Yes. Hey. Give me a kiss. Hey, Johnny. Give me a kiss. No, you perv! Johnny. Hi, gangster. Hi. How's things? OK. That's good. That's good. Good. Life is good, isn't it? Yeah. Eh? - Yeah. It's been a while, kid. I almost found someone else. You can call me again from now on. Were you on holiday? - Something like that. Is that for me? - It's good to see you again. Thanks. I didn't say a word from what was in that script. For five months. Johnny, Johnny. What are you doing here? - I got bored at your place. Listen to him, he got bored. Shouldn't you be at school? I'm on holiday so I'm at yours for a week. - Does he live with you now or what? The people from the home said a week with me was OK? That's what we agreed. What? What we agreed? Then it must be OK. Sit down. - Hey, pal. Go on, tell me something. Tell the people something. Go on, say something! - Give over. I don't always know, Johnny! You expect me to entertain you but you have nothing to say yourself. Here come the drinks. - The drinks are here. Come on. - Are you still here? Are you in love with me, Johnny? Are you in love with me too? - Dude... In love with Hollywood, I suppose? Then you belong. "Oh, he's acting in a Hollywood film. Well, well." I'm looking good. Is Antony looking good, Johnny? I asked you a question. Or are you going to start sucking up to me too? The truth, please, no sucking up. You're smashed. At least that's the truth. Now you can stay, Johnny. - Yeah yeah. No lying, you little bastard. They all suck up to you but behind your back... I know all about it. I don't know if I was any good. - You practised with Antony, so... If you don't get the role, there'll be a next time. Yeah, but it'd be sick if I did. I'll be right back. - The movie starts soon. You go on. I'm coming. Hey, Johnny. Johnny, hey, take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, Johnny. Here, here. Hey. Fucker. Fuck off. - Take it easy. Calm down. Hey, take it easy. Rip-off merchant! You ripped me off. Shhh, hey, hey. You don't get it, do you? You don't get it. You are all I have. You are the only ones I can trust. Get me? But I didn't know if I could trust you. I had to put you to the test. Get it? You don't know what my life is like. I don't know what's going on, am constantly on my guard. Fucking stress, all the time. Get me? That's why it happened. See? That's why. But it's in the past now, OK? It's in the past. It's in the past. Everything's fine now. OK? Come here. You lot belong with me, OK? Come on. What's your problem? Everything'll be fine. Hey. Who are you? - Johnny, and you? Celine. Antony? Johnny. No, Johnny. Have you been using? Yes. So what, Johnny? So what? Are the police going to punish me? Is my wife going to throw me out? What are you going to do? I've had enough now. Go away and leave me in peace. Where am I supposed to go? Home. To your friends, the kids' home. I don't know. Are you still enjoying this? I'm not. I don't feel like doing it anymore. I've got nothing more to say to you. I'm a loser, Johnny. And you won't amount to much either so... - Cut the crap. It's not crap. I'm telling the truth. We were going to tell the truth, weren't we? Are we going to suck up to each other and send emojis with hearts while everyone is falling apart? Go on, kid, get out of here. You're stoned. - I'm not. No, I'm lucid. This is a lucid moment, Johnny. And we should make the most of it. What did you think? That I'd adopt you? Look after you? A kid I don't know, who I bought dope off of. No. No. Get out. Piss off, get lost, the street's calling. - Antony. Piss off. Piss off. Get lost. Get lost. Get lost! I'm not your father. Piss off. - Loser. I'm very pleased to meet you in this little country of ours. Do you still like being here? - Sure, it will always be my home. And I'd like it to be home to lots of people. Yes, that is a subject very close to your heart, isn't it? You've become the face of a campaign for refugees. Yes, because those people live in appalling conditions and people forget it is still happening. People don't flee for fun. It is a subject that is indeed very close to my heart. Yeah, you even went to a refugee camp with a camera crew. Can I have some? Why don't you reply to my messages? - Leave him alone, he's chillin'. You can't answer for yourself or what? They're looking for you at the home. Are you stoned? - As always, sweetheart. Piss off. I want to talk to him. At least show some respect. Sure, sure. I'm leaving. What's up with you? Eh? What happened to make you do this? It's best if you and me are done. - If I leave now we really will be. Go on then. OK. Fuck you, pal. Mr Ophoff. this is Tacha from the children's home. I've tried calling you a few times. It's about Johnny, he hasn't been at the home for a week. Apparently he's got a role in a film with you and needs to be somewhere Monday. If you know anything, please get in touch. Thanks. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. Please, you should know that, you should. Come on. One more time. One more time, eh? It's not that hard. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm so tired. Want some too, kid? - Hey, Johnny. Not too much. Show us your muscles. I'm here for you. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. Hey, Johnny. Not too much. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. Johnny. Come on, kid. Fuck. Fuck. No heartbeat. We'll have to shock him. Clear. One. Clear. Two. Last time. Clear. Three. Mum.
