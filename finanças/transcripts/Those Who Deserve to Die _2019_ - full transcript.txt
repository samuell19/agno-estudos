(clock ticking) (flames crackling) I'm gonna go on up. (clock ticking) Try to stop thinking about it. It's just these... these doctors. Never knowing whether or not they're telling the truth. Charles, you worry as if that's gonna help, as if there's something you can do about it. I just feel so helpless. I've always been able to take care of my own problems, Gloria. Put it in His hands, Charles. There's no problem He can't solve. There's no miracle He can't perform... if we have faith. You get a good night's sleep. I guarantee you won't feel like this in the morning. (trembling) (flames crackling) (clock ticking) (knocking) Gloria? (door closes) Hm? Something the matter? (low music) There's someone in the house. (dramatic electronic music) (clattering, Gloria groans) (clattering) (groaning) (groaning) (ears ringing) (banging echoes) (ringing intensifies) (intense music) (tense music) (Gloria sobbing) Don't let her die. Don't let her die. (Gloria sobbing) (squelching) It's so warm! (door squeaking) Uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not 100 percent sure I'm ready to be a landlord. Since you're here, you might as well have a look. I assume you have references. If you don't mind my asking, how old are you? You seem a little old for a sophomore. I got sidetracked. Military service. Oh, what branch? Army. Got laid up with an injury. Long rehab. Hate to hear that. At least you made it back in one piece. You said something about references. Got your military ID on you? Yes, sir. That's reference enough for me. You want the place, rent's due first of the month. Move in now? Looks like you're already in. Jonathan Wyndham. Clement Greene. (light music) (knocking) All settled? Yes, thank you. (Clement sighs) Feels strange having someone living in this room again. You have a son. I do. In fact, I have 37 kids. When our own went to college and moved on, Sheila and I... that was Mrs. Greene... became foster parents, mostly kids transitioning through the system: 37, 36 plus Christopher. Thirty-seven. We were aiming for 40, and then... Sheila got sick. Where are your people? There's just me. Ah, Harvest Social tonight. Big street party on campus. Why don't you get out and go explore? (chatter) Good evening. We have an unexpected treat for you tonight. Someone who's done more than anyone I know to protect the heritage and the integrity of our great state. Please, welcome Chief Justice Melanie Merrill. (applause) Ah, Jonathan, I wasn't sure you'd pick up. I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to ask a favor. I ran off and I left my notebook on the table with some papers in there that I need to give to somebody. ...but across this beautiful state of ours. I can't get away. Any chance that you could drop 'em by? The Women's Club, the Harvest Social. Yeah, could you come now? I know it's a lot to ask, but it really would help me out. - Thanks. - ...to which we have said... - Yeah, yeah, see you in a few. - No, thank you, not in Alabama! (applause) Hello, dear. Where have you been? - I never see you. - I've been busy. Margaret, I am so glad that you could make it. Margaret is working with Humanities to secure funding for her program. - Is she? - Yes, she is. Tell me, James, where would you put my chances right now? (chatter) Well, you know, uh, there are many factors to be considered. Oh, well, now, I'm sure that with a good word from the right people that Margaret could have anything she wanted. If only she'd ask. It's all a matter of ambition, dear. I'll keep that in mind. Well, if you'll follow me, I would love to have you meet the new member on the board. All right. Look at you. Would it kill you to wear some makeup? (chatter) (gentle guitar music) I will twine, I will mingle my raven black hair With the roses so red and the lilies so fair And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue The pale amanita... Hi, I'm just looking to drop this off... Jonathan, you're a life-saver! Come have a drink while you're here. - Ah, no, I'll head out. - Nonsense! You went to all the trouble of coming here. Wait, you didn't sign in! Jonathan, this is Margaret. Margaret, this is, uh... my roommate, at least for the semester, Jonathan. ...my idols were clay What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Everything's perfectly fine. (sighs) I'll be right back. Don't let her drink anymore. ...and promised to love And to cherish me over all others above I'm gonna get another one. You want one? No. Suit yourself. Margaret... No words of farewell (scoffs) Margaret! Now I know what Clement said to you. He thinks I'm drunk. He told you to stop me if I get another drink. (glasses breaking) Well, who does he think he is? And who the hell are you? I am Jonathan Wyndham. ...his wildwood flower And I'm a threat to everyone around me. Ah, Clement. (upbeat guitar music) Shit. When were you discharged? Who said I was... January. Conditional? Honorable. Two tours of active combat. Second Battalion, 7th Cav. I might've served a third, but my unit was ambushed during Operation Al-Fajr. Seven men killed. I was the only survivor. (somber music) Captured... and tortured. I would've been killed. I was the next in line. The cameras were rolling. (man speaking foreign language) I was looking into the guy's eyes. Could smell his cologne. He asked me... He asked me if... - What happened? - And fire. - Missiles away. - Hellfire strike took out the entire stronghold, blew off the roof, tore out the walls, everyone killed... (radio transmission) ...except one. Severe TBI. Three months in Brookhaven where they cracked... Shut the fuck up. In the joyous days of childhood I'm sorry. I didn't mean shut up, I just meant... Look, these people, they can't hear that. They don't understand. Shit. Hello, James. Margaret, I hope you don't think that I was hedging before. It's just that... James Newhall, this is... Jonathan Wyndham! You know, "The Last Man Standing." Fox did this whole big special. Wow! (laughs) I'm honored. Oh, thank you for your service, first of all. Is he one of yours? No, I, I just... Well, if Jonathan Wyndham were on your team... Songs of heaven which you sang with childish voice Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, and, uh, welcome to New Canaan. Talk soon. Or are songs of earth your choice? Will the circle be unbroken - All right... - Hang on. - By and by, Lord, by and by - Wait. This is me. This is where we meet. Tuesdays at 7. If you wanna drop by, drop by. I don't understand. Clement told you, right? The support group? It's group therapy. I connect veterans with service providers. DDs and OTHs mostly, but even general discharges have to fight for benefits these days. It's criminal. Margaret Merrill? That's right. Any relation to Judge Merrill? You mean Justice Merrill. Yeah, she used to be my mother. In the sky Will the circle be unbroken Maybe I'll see you Tuesday? By and by, Lord, by and by Yeah. Maybe. There's a better home awaiting In the sky, Lord, in the sky (knocking) You turned the security bolt again. I need you to unlock it. (crickets chirring) Dad? Is everything all right? (eerie music) (screams, keys drop) Jesus, Holy Mary... (television in background) (gasps) Please don't hurt the baby! He's my grandson. (baby crying) He's my daughter's boy. (baby crying) She's been through so much. She would just die if something happened to him. We all would. (baby crying) The only way to punish them for the past... (baby crying) ...is to deprive them of the future. (baby crying) (door slams) (baby crying) No! It won't hurt at all. (baby crying) I promise. (funky music) (squelching) Walk right in, sit right down Daddy, let your mind roll on (indistinct pleas) Daddy, let your mind roll on (unintelligible shouting) Help them! Help them. (sobbing) (radio transmission) (door opens) (television in background) Jonathan. I was worried about you. Why? Well, just... strange days, that's all. It's all happening right now on Route 46, so shop today from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and tomorrow from noon... What do you know about Margaret Merrill? Margaret Merrill? Never mind. (jingle plays on television) Jonathan? Too late for a cup of coffee? Never too late. Sit. Relax. (car infomercial on television) You called me to the party so you could introduce me to her. Why? You don't beat around the bush much, do you? Was it so I could get treatment in her group? Or so I could help her secure funding for her program? Maybe both. Maybe neither. To tell you the truth, I don't know why. You just strike me as a couple people that might have something in common and... get along together. Is she married? No. Seeing someone? Oh, um, a... (mellow music) Margaret is a... complicated individual. Was born and raised in this town, yet she never really fit in. Maybe that's why she's so good with people who, uh, have trouble adjusting. Like me. Yeah. (sighs) (dark cello music) You're thinking what I'm thinking, aren't you? Hello? I'll be out in a second. Just cleaning up. Oh. Tuesday night. You're a little late. Um, you know, regardless of the impression you may have gotten the other night, I'm not looking to recruit you. You know, as advocate or spokesperson or anything like that, so if that's why you didn't come to the meeting, don't let that discourage you. No, I know that. I wanted to see you. Sure. Tell me what's going on. I... (chuckles) I'm interested in seeing you. Okay. I appreciate you coming out here, although I would've preferred you come to the actual meeting, but... this sort of thing isn't permitted between group leader and participants. I know. That's why I didn't come to the meeting. Listen... You seem like a nice enough guy, Jonathan, but I'm just getting the feeling... Good or bad? Um... Good night, Jonathan. Thank you for stopping by. I didn't mean anything by it. Hold up a second. You... Do you have anyone you can talk to? Other people with shared experience. Shared experience? No one from my unit survived. No one can understand what I went through. One drink. (chatter) (rumbling, rain falling) (dark music) Well? What? Is she interested in you or not? You know me. I can never tell. But I think... maybe. You'll make her interested. You'll find a way. I'll help. Judge Merrill's daughter. We were looking for a way, and now we have it. Oh, we're going to twist the knife right inside her baby girl's heart. Jonathan? Yes? Don't. (church bells chiming) Girls! You're going to be late for church. (footsteps) Whoa, whoa, you're gonna need warmer coats. They're in the back chifforobe. Okay. (church bells chiming) (clacking) (chaotic music) - Here. - I'm tired of you acting like such a baby, Louisa. - Come on! - What are you doing? Please! What's wrong? (screaming) You will not harm these girls. You will leave this house at... (choking) Look at me. (choking) Can you see me? Do you know the name Berenice? She was a nine-year-old little girl. Do you remember her? (choking) Oh, yes. She remembers. (voice echoing) (music intensifies) In Jesus's name, spare me! (stabbing) (music stops suddenly) Jonathan! There are witnesses! They're innocent. They're just little girls. So was I, Jonathan. Remember? No. How could you? You weren't there. (fanciful music) Where are you going? I'm supposed to be a student here, right? Can I come? If I'm with you... ...I look at you and talk to you, people see that and think I'm having some kind of... Fine. I'll stay. Just don't forget... who she is. (soft music) You're safe when you're sleeping Never, never knew Hey. How long have you been here? You could actually come to the meeting, you know. What is it you think we do in there anyway? We just talk. We listen. We drink too much coffee. I don't know, I'm a private person. Private or withdrawn? Thanks. You know, Jonathan, the only way you're gonna make... Stop. Well? This is why I don't go inside. Last thing I need is somebody else inside my head. Okay. Just so you know, I'm not looking to mindfuck you. (Jonathan laughs) You gotta understand, when I find someone interesting, I... I wanna know more about them. I mean, you might call it getting inside your head, but... I call it getting to know someone. If we're gonna do this, I mean, whatever this turns out to be, you don't get to call timeout. It doesn't work that way. You call timeout, the game's over, okay? Okay. If I want in, you gotta let me in. But that... That works both ways, right? Absolutely. If you're allowed to get inside me, then I'm allowed to get inside you. (Jonathan laughs) I'm sorry. Um, no, no, uh, don't apologize. No? No. (mellow music) Let me take some of the pressure off you, Jonathan. I don't know what you think that was, but... it was only a kiss. It didn't mean anything? It had no meaning. Uh, so... I'll be letting myself out before things get any more uncomfortable. Um, you know, I apologize for the whole... mouth thing. (door closing) (shrill music) (vocalizing) (moaning) Fuck. (slams door) You don't have to stay. Try and make me leave. (moaning) I know you, Jonathan. I can see right into you. (moaning) Leave something inside her. (moaning) No, no, Jonathan, don't... (moaning) (water bubbling) (somber piano music) (water bubbling) What? What? (water bubbling) All of it, except five dollars. (unintelligible) But that's all I can spare. You can't leave me like this! And I came all this way. (unintelligible) Oh, don't you see, my husband, he will discover everything. Well, I have to make another connection. If you really want it, I might accept that ring for five dollars. But it was my engagement ring! (unintelligible) (static) Go back. Let me take you back... ...and show you... (static) ...what you cannot remember... Mrs. Lynn? ...because you did not see because you were not there. Mrs. Lynn? Would you follow me, please? I appreciate you comin' out, Mrs. Lynn. It's important for us to straighten this out. - Emotions run high. - I just want my daughter back. I assure you she's been well taken care of. Mother was strong. What it comes down to is this, the property rights, the waterfront acreage, that's gone... She believed in justice. ...and it's all perfectly legal. Unfortunate for you, but legal. You sign a quitclaim to the property and the development rights... She did not know the rules of law could be changed. ...and we'll put all of this behind us. Who's us? Who's we? (sinister music) We are the authorities. We are the law. Mrs. Lynn, could you stand, please? Who are you? - They threatened her. - Raise your arms. Ow, what, no, you can't... - They bullied her. - ...arrest me. You gonna sit there? Get your hands off of me! - Come on. - What? - Stop resisting. - No. Take it easy, put your hands - behind your back. - No! You're not being arrested, you're just being detained, now relax! (sinister music) Mrs. Lynn, just relax. They violated her rights. (intense music) No! (metal clanging) Maybe, if you'd been there, it might have been different. You were just a boy then. And maybe you could have stopped it, but we'll never know... ...'cause you were not there. We should call an ambulance. Not just yet. Once they got what they wanted, they disposed of the evidence. Her husband is in county lockup. I'll have him sent over to state. It'll be a lot easier to deal with him there once he's lost in the crowd. And one by one, they buried us... ...except for one. There's a son, right? Except for you... Military school in Vidalia. A real fuck up, but just a kid. ...'cause you were not there. (tense music) (indistinct commands) (tense music) Sorry, Jonathan. (tense music) For years, you were alone. You suffered. You endured. You survived. (tense music) They offered you the cup to take away the pain of living. (tense music) (cup banging) American cowboy. Well, so be it. (music intensifies) Don't worry, Jonathan. I'll give you strength. (roar of planes overhead) (explosion) (dark music) Why didn't you die, Jonathan? You had so many opportunities. (groaning) You had a reason to live. Purpose. I promised I would give you strength, and I did. That's why I appeared to you... ...to show you the way. Vengeance is ours. (intense music) An eye for an eye wasn't enough. I didn't want an eye... I wanted the entire head. All that they are, all that they ever hoped to become. We took our time, we carefully laid the plans, until they were ready for execution. It will be as if they never existed, and all... will be right... in the world. (ominous music) I'm not hurting Margaret. (alarm blaring) (muffled alarm blaring) (alarm blaring) No, no. They've seen me. Who? (alarm blaring) (film rewinding) (muffled alarm blaring) (film rewinding) (beep) (dark music) - Margaret. - Yeah? A visitor. You need me to stick around? It's okay. I'll see you tonight, all right? Hey, uh, I was hoping you'd stop by. Listen, I have something to talk to you about. - It's, it's kind of big, so... - Listen, Margaret, I can't stay here anymore. Well, hold on. We'll talk through it, I just... - Something's kinda come up. - There's no more time to talk. If I don't get out of here now, - it's gonna be bad. - Okay, well... (door opening) I'm so sorry to interrupt you... I don't mean to trouble you at all, ma'am. I'm just supposed to pick up a friend here, and I ain't seen hair nor hide of her. - I was wondering if ya... - Uh, who's that? Well, it's a girl about your age, uh, she's a daughter of a friend of mine, Max Lynn, her name's Berenice. Either one of y'all ever heard of her? No, I don't think so. Yeah, if you knowed her, you wouldn't forget her, especially with a name like that. You don't hear that every day, now? I'm sorry, why would she be here? Well, see, that's the thing. I couldn't put grits to gravy of that in my mind neither. But, I don't know, I figured she'd be at a mall... Okay, well, you know you're welcome to wait in the lobby, but we're just - shutting down here. - Here I am gabbin', takin' up all y'all's time. I'll just, I'll just go on outside and wait, and smoke a cigarette... I know they're supposed to be killers, but, uh, old habits die hard. Thank y'all for your kindness, all right, y'all take care. I need to go. Well, I know, but just wait a second, Jonathan. - Once I take care of this... - Jonathan, I should... Hang on, listen, hey! Don't come back. If you leave now, don't come back. Margaret, you don't understand. Because you never tell me anything. You just stand there, like a statue, all... You don't know anything about me. You don't know that I am trying to protect you. Ow, stop, you can't do that! You can't shake me! You can't... you can't shake me. If you wanna leave... leave. (metal door rattling) (eerie music) You know, you don't need to be yellin' at your own girl like that, especially when you know how much you mean to her. Womenfolk, what they like is to be treated with a little bit of tenderness. What do you want? You shoot straight to the point, don't ya? I want you to get in the car. I want you and me to go for a little ride, sort some things out, how 'bout that? (eerie music) Why would I go anywhere with you? (eerie music) Leather seats? (eerie music) Well, if you want we can go settle this inside. Don't reckon your girlfriend would like that that much, though. (upbeat radio music) Go on, drink the coffee if you want to. I got one with cream and sugar, and one plain. Figured I'd cover my bases. (upbeat radio music) We gonna need all the energy we can get for what comes next. (music continues) That's right. Hits ya hard, doesn't it? Close your eyes. 'Fore you know it, it'll all be over with. It'll all be over... (energetic music) (tense music) (hammer banging) (tense music) (ominous music) Yeah. (tools rattling) Jesus. (tense music) They'll kill him. If they haven't already. Maybe he saw 'em coming. Maybe he'll get away. (roar of airplane overhead) The way you described him, I thought I'd be seeing me a pitbull. Nothin' but a little ol' mutt. A dog is a dog. Put him in a bag. Throw him in the water. (seagulls squawking) (boat engine humming) (foreboding music) (seagulls squawking) Shrimpin's all I used to do... ...back before the oil spill killed it off. Me and my daddy, we'd chase shrimp up and down the Florida coast. Hell of a life. (tense music) After Daddy died, I figured it'd be easier to just, uh... ...get a job working for the state. Sure as hell do miss it, though. Couldn't get rid of the boat, though, you know it? She, uh, been in the family too long. (dramatic music) Well, all right then. (splashing) (music intensifies) (splashing) (tense music) (insects chirring) (relaxed radio music) Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream (eerie music) Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream (eerie music) Row, row, row your boat... ...gently down the stream Life is but a dream (dramatic beat) (eerie music) (music intensifies) (insects buzzing) Names. Why is she asking for names? She's doin' it again. - I wonder if she's trying... - Did you check her? - Check her, what do we... - Did you pat her down? No. So you're gonna let this woman walk in here and bring us down because you're too shy to pat her down? - Pat her down for what? - A wire, Charles! If I know anything about women, I know that that one is wearing a goddamn wire! (phone ringing) Yeah? (receiver clanging) You might've called. Where is he? Who? You know who. He's alive. He has been killin' off the entire town. He has a very Old Testament view of the world. If given the chance, he'd kill us all. Not all of us. Wait, do you think... You naive child. You think you mean something to him? You're nothing to him. You're... you're not even a piece of ass. You're bait. I mean, the only reason that, that he is pretending to be interested in you is so that he can get closer to me. If that is the case, Mother... ...I will be happy to have helped. You see, I know what he's done... ...and I know why he did it. How deeply you despise me, Margaret. Resentment just flows through your veins, doesn't it? Oh, I can't blame you really. It couldn't have been easy growin' up Justice Merrill's daughter. If it makes any difference to you, bein' Justice Merrill was no walk in the park. (sighing) After your father died, they descended... like locusts. Who? Oh, bankers, the lawyers, his business associates, all eager to take advantage. I fought them all tooth and nail. I turned off my feelin's, and allowed myself to become hardened. But I was determined... ...no one would ever take advantage of me. If I asked you... ...if I asked you to spare Jonathan... ...would you? (bell tolling) (birds chirping) Hey. How you holdin' up? Oh, you know. Yeah. What's it now, four months? Five. I know you... don't know where Jonathan is. I know you don't have any way of contacting him. That's right. But I'm just starting to get a little... scared, you know? If he contacts you, will you... ...will you tell him I'm... ...just tell him I need him. (somber music) I almost didn't keep it. (sorrowful music) I didn't mind giving up part of myself, but you... ...I couldn't lose any part of you. Margaret, you can't come with me. They know who I am. - If anyone saw me with you... - No, you're wrong. Listen. Just promise me the killing will stop. I can make it all go away. (sorrowful music) She can fix this. She can help us, she can... I need you... I need you to trust me. (fire hissing, crackling) You once told me I could have anything I wanted, if only I would ask. So I'm asking. Are you sure this is what you want? Never more sure. And how badly do you want it? Would you, uh, beg for his life? If that's what it takes. I beg you, Mother... please, if you could... Is this your idea of begging? (ominous music) For my sake, for the sake of my baby, - please... - Stop it. (sinister music) Continue. If you've ever wanted to do anything for me... What you don't seem to realize is that Margaret is the only thing keeping you alive right now. Is that a fact? Because you see, from where I'm sittin', she seems to be pleadin' for your life, not mine. It's funny, but uh, you don't strike me as a killer, just don't seem capable. Give me a taste of your murderous side, just a glimpse, so I'll know you are who you say you are. No more killing. Oh, well, how convenient. Show me some teeth, or get on your knees. What more do you want from me, I've already... Shut up! Shut your mouth! Ugly. (fire crackling) Are you a killer... or a coward? Hm? (sinister music) Let's go. Bye, Mother. You take one more step, and I swear to baby Jesus I will put a bullet through the both of you. (dark funky music) Leave. (funky music) Oh, well, that's better. I know you're in there. Show yourself. Come on, now. Come out, come out, wherever you are. And just so you know, I loved you. Come on, now. (dark music) I said... turn around and face me! No. (labored breathing) If you wanna kill him... you'll have to kill me first. (gunshot) (music intensifies) (groaning) (indistinct conversation) (unintelligible sobbing) (unintelligible) (grunting) (squelching) No, no, no! (dark funky music) What'd you expect? How else could this have ended? (screaming) ?dedne evah siht dluoc esle woH (dramatic music) (discordant music) .srou si ecnaegneV This business of fighting and dying... (tense music) ...I wish there was a better way, but it seems the only way to accomplish anything in this world is to kill or to die. Americans don't understand that, the power of dying. All they care about is staying alive. And that, ironically, will be the death of them. Here, drink this. It will calm you. It will allow for things to go easy for you. And you? Would you martyr yourself? Is there anything in your life worth dying for? Hm? (dark funky music) No! (music intensifies) (somber music) And every night, I get down on my knees, and I pray for the judgment and the strength to continue to defend the way of life that we have all struggled so hard to attain. God bless New Canaan. God bless the state of Alabama! And God bless America! (somber music) (mellow music) (door creaking) (mellow music) (music ends)
