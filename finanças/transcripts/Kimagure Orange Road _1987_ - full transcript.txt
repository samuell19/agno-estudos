As one encounter led to a double romance... ...three beating hearts... ...played gentle melodies. I, Kasuga Kyosuke, 15 years old... ...am living the best years of my youth! That's the accelerator screamin', as the tires are squealin'... ...takin' you along, a girl I hardly knew, in my speedin' coupe. You slammed the door, evadin' the shadows that followed... ...sayin' "Take me anywhere, just go!" An encounter is like a highway junction... I've fallen in love with you - that I realized... ...by the time the seaport was in sight... "Take me to Summer Side" Sayin' that you desire tenderness over a caress... "Night of Summer Side" ...the way you avoided me, usin' that na?ve look, wasn't so innocent. "Take me to Summer Side" Sayin' that you desire a caress over loneliness... "Night of Summer Side" ...the way you looked into my eyes as you turned back wasn't so innocent. Kimagure Orange Road A Little Lemony Kiss for Her "So, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?" "Well, the truth is... the truth is..." "...the first time I met you, by those steps..." "I fell in..." "...love with you." "I-I didn't know..." "Madoka..." "Kyosuke..." Madoka... You liar! You're lying! You know the truth, don't you, Manami?! Oh, c'mon, how should I know? Never mind that! Help me with this... - What's going on?! How can you be arguing this early in the morning? Huh? Forget about it. This kinda thing has nothing to do with you, Kyosuke. Hey, I mean, they say "a kiss tastes like a lemon!" "...a kiss?!" - Oh, stop it, Kurumi! Tell the truth, you little! - Well? Out with it! Kyosuke... Huh? I'm told that you used the power yesterday. What?! W-Well... Well, you used it with good intentions, I hear, - but if you aren't more careful, we'll be making the movers rich again. I know that! Sheesh! You and your big mouth! Hmm? Bumble-bumble-bumble... Kurumi, lying is a bad thing! Why you! You big-mouthed little raccoon! Dad, you're a liar! You told me you'd keep that a secret! Oh, but, you see... Huh? Hey, Jingoro! Where are you going? Hey, you! You've got to eat during your meal time, or else! Tsk-tsk! - No-no! I knew that I shouldn't use the power, even without Dad's scolding. Uh-oh! I'm late! I'm late! A-Ayukawa! Hmph! It'd be awful if I got slapped again! It's all right. What? The teacher. He's not here yet. I walk down the hallway at the same time every day. And, when I do... ...the teacher comes up the stairs 30 seconds later! Hear what I mean?! I've gotta be honest... Ayukawa is indeed cute! She must've been in a bad mood yesterday... ...or so I thought. I've got to try my best to avoid having to move out of town... ...or so I thought. What're you doing, if I may ask? W-W-Well, n... Hot, isn't it?! Really! I don't know what Ayukawa is thinking. Nope, I don't have a clue! That's Sugimoto from Homeroom B. Lemme see... According to last year's data, her breast size is 78 cm! So, it should easily be 80+ by now! Oh, 'tis such remarkable progress! Wow! Er, the score was 9.3! 9.3! Next, Ayukawa... Okey-dokey, looks like our team's up! W-What about Ayukawa's score? I don't associate myself with delinquents. Come on! Our game! Sugimoto, that was great! Yeah, that was great! No wonder you're in the Gym Club! That was awesome! What I saw was so great that I didn't realize... Don't stop! Finish what you're supposed to! ...can you believe that?! ...even then, unconsciously, I... O-O-Oops! C'mon! C'mon! Over there! C'mon! Block him! Here! Kasuga! - C'mon! Go for it! Show me what you've got! Fine! I'll show ya... Oh? He's confident! ...or so I said, but... Oh? - Huh? It's in! One more minute! - Yeah! Nice shot! Man, am I beat! Kasuga! - Oh? Go for it! It's comeback time! Oh! - What the...?! A-Ayukawa's watching! - Over there! C'mon! C'mon! If... if I could win the game... ...then maybe, just maybe my dream will come true... ...and it won't have to be a dream! Of course! If I use the power without anyone noticing... But... But... If I'd used the power, I could have turned the game around. But... but, showing her the best of me by using the power... ...felt like I'd be deceiving Ayukawa. "Game over!" On second thought, maybe I should've used the power! Oh? It's the brother of those bratty twins! Look at that! What a creep! I wonder what the look on Ayukawa's face was at that moment. N-No way! No doubt about it. He's... ...pretty awesome! Holy cow! Oh, boy! He's cute! Year 1, Homeroom C (Grade 7) Well? How's the tamago-yaki? Was it a bit too sweet? Lemme see here... Delicious! It's wonderful! And the sausages? Super! Super! Did you guys really make that all by yourselves? We make our brother's too, so mornings are rather busy! Right, Manami? Uh-huh! - Oh, my! Your brother's too? And, this brother of yours, does he prefer certain types, or...? No, I meant "food," when I was asking about his tastes! Food! You silly! I wasn't asking about what kind of wom... or girls he likes! Oh, c'mon! How 'bout an after-meal treat? What?! Don't be so modest. Oh? Okay, I'll get some milk for you! What's come over Hikaru? Bumble-bumble, I dunno! Why you! Don't lay your hands on my lunch! C'mon! It's mine! I got it! I got it! I still wonder... At last, believe it or not, I got my hands - on some, for the first time in 4 days! G-Got what? Ta-da! The legendary cutlet sandwich! Oh, no, you don't! I mean, look how tough it is to get one of these! Ta-da! How did you manage to get ahold of TWO glorious cutlet sandwiches?! Skill, my boy. Skill. Shit! - Easy, easy... Oh, speaking of which... Kasuga, why aren't you over there buying lunch? Huh? Oh! My sisters make me a bento lunch, so... A b-bento?! Y-Y'mean those cute sisters of yours make 'em... ...with those c-cute hands of theirs?! Ir-irresistible! Kasuga! No, I mean, Kasuga, dear chum! Share my cutlet sandwich! So, in exchange, I want your sisters... ...I mean, their bento... Wh-What the...? All right! - Oh! Why, that punk! He's trying to beat me to them! Hold it right there, Hatta! H...Hey, wait a minute! That's my bento! Hold it! Hold it, you! I won't! No way! Dear Sweet Milk! Hatta! Hold it, you! You shouldn't be running in the hallway! Hot damn! No way! Am I dreaming?! Did I, just now... Y-You... What the hell? What the hell are you guys doing?! Oh! Er, well, you see... I'm no match for him! Time to split! Wh-? Hey, you! See ya, Darling! "Darling?!" "Darling" she said?! Why, you! One, two! One, two! Faculty Office Faculty Office Kasuga! Y-You... Be calm, Mr. Otsuka! Violence won't solve anything! Besides, Kasuga is new to our school. Well, why won't he confess and apologize?! B-But, sir, you cited me for "illicit sexual conduct in the hallway!" I won't let you deny it! Besides, you just switched schools! How dare you! Don't you know that Hiyama Hikaru is a student who... Hikaru? Thank you. Start at the Vice Principal's desk, then do this part of the office. ...not only has a filthy mouth... ...but she's known to hang out with a bunch of delinquents! Please, go easy, Mr. Otsuka. Kasuga didn't know that... Hogwash! How we begin things is all-important, Mr. Matsuoka! Kasuga?! Punishing a female student who's violated school rules... ...by making her arrange flowers... ...is more-or-less pointless, isn't it? You may be right, but oh well... B-But, sir, even though she might look like a delinquent... ...that alone doesn't mean she is a delinquent, does it? What did you say, you?! LIKE a delinquent, or IS a delinquent, it's all the same thing! Don't try to confuse me with some stupid argument! But, it's not like she's done anything really wrong. If you label her like that, it wouldn't be fair. T-T-T-Twerp! You just got here, and the punks have already recruited you! N-No, that's not what I meant... M-Mr. Otsuka! Look, Kasuga. Listen to what I say... The student named Hiyama Hikaru is... Huh? M-Mr. Otsuka... ...along with your classmate, Ayukawa. - Mr. Otsuka... What?! Sensei... Ayukawa! Well, then, pardon me... A-Ayukawa... Fine, Mr. Otsuka! Let's discuss exactly - what it is that makes me a delinquent! For some reason, I suddenly felt quite bold. Well done. Ayukawa! Your bag... It feels rather light. My bag? You took the trouble to bring it to me?! Well, wouldn't you be in big trouble if some delinquent had stolen it? Leave without me. -Madoka Leave without me. -Madoka Huh? What's this? Hmph! Oh, well, enough for today. What is it? Oh, nothing! If I reach out towards your red lips, there right before my eyes... ...if I just reach out with all my might... ...maybe I can touch them. That's the feeling that I got during that sunset. Oh! Jingoro! Why, you! How dare you?! You good-for-nothing! Why, you! Let go of it, you! Hey! Hey! Let go, I said! I dream of casting a spell that captures your heart... ...and makes you crazy about me. Love is deja vu; an unfamiliar memory. I feel our lips pressing together. Love me... tenderly... Golden Summer Mirage... Someday... Someday... Please let my body feel your lips... ...on that morning I'll be called your lover. Someday, someday... I'll be waiting for that moment. I, right in front of Ayukawa... ...er, slow-danced with Hikaru! To top it off, I promised to go out on a date! A-Ayukawa! Wait a second! What I really feel is that... Next time: "Feelings Stirred - The Rolling First Date." I can't decide what to do.
