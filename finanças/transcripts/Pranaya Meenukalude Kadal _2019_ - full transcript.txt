Stop here. Choi brother... Please come here. This is Muthukoya. Didn't Hassan Koya call you? He's from Lakshdweep. The deal is between HassanKoya and an Arab from Qatar. It's a battered dhow on the island. Hassankoya got this dealalong with Muthukoya. It has to be repaired and sent to the Arab. You say the rest. It should reach Qatar before this Bakrid. Hassan Koya told to assign the work to you. I won't have time. I'm working on an important boat now. It'll take time to complete this work. Damodharan... Damodharan is also a foreman like me. Take some boys with you and repair that boat. It's in Lakshadweep. I don't have any problem to go.But it's difficult to get boys. There isn't anyone who knows thework like in the olden days. You just try. Let me see. This 'Manju' belongs to the Arakkalfamily of Kavaratti island. We, islanders say 'Manju' for dhow. I know. It was in use until five years back. It tumbled down in the storm. It's been lying there like that ever since. Only women are there at Arakkal now. They're not interested in it. That's how Hassan Koya and I got the deal. I remember that boat. It was built here. My father, Choi kutty's father and I were all there. My father was the foreman. Imbichikka, I didn't notice you sitting here. Where else will I go? Though I'm not well, I come and sit here daily. The last time I came here, wasn't there a boy who dropped me off at the railway station? Yes. Imbichikka's daughter's son. Yes. Oh God! I was praying to God whilesitting on the bike with him. Why? He was speeding like anything. Isn't he here? It's better not to talk about him. Today's boys are not interestedin this kind of work. His friend has come from Dubai.They have all gone for tour. It's been four days. Ajmal! Ajmal! Don't leave your hand. What happened? He was trying to take selfie by standing on the bike. Lost his footing and fell down. Hey, do something. -Be careful. -Ajmal! Don't worry. -Keep holding. -My hands are aching. I'll fall down now. Hold on. Fire force is on their way. You don't need to worry. Dude, fireforce is here. Don't worry. Hold onto it. -Sir, over there. -Sir, hurry up. Ajmal, they are coming. Don't move. Ajmal, are you okay? Here. Lay him here. Check his breath. Dude, aren't you okay? He and his selfie! Where's my mobile? At least you didn't lose it amidst this. Thank God. Take it. Dude... I got the selfie. Doesn't it look good? Where are you? I'm in Wagamon. Touring. Will you come back in two days? What happened? There's one matter. I'll come. I can't go to the island. I'll be bored to death. That too for three months. I'm going to quit thisboat building job. Well, isn't he trying to be a film actor? With six packs and long hair! Why are you always loitering around like this? You always go here and therein the name of shooting. But I've never seen you in any movie. Don't tease him, mother. I saw him in a movie the other day. Dressed up as a porter, he was there inthe background carrying a big suitcase. Stop blabbering and leave. My time will come one day. Rajanikanth used to be a bus conductor. After all, I was the hero in two music albums. That's true. Mother, have you seen hisacting in those music videos? He thinks he's Dulquer Salman. Shut up and leave. If I've had a son, he would have become a foreman like Damodharan. My father and his father used to be boat builders. That's our tradition. Grandfather, this is not your ancestor's age. I don't want to rot in here. It's because your father went for fishing in the sea that you all did your studies. I'm fed up of hearing this. Just like the dialogue from a 80's movie. Mother, I'll go mad if I go to Lakshadweep. Two of Mohanlal's films aregoing to get released. I won't go leaving all that. Also, there are no theatres or shopping malls there. God knows if there is network there. There'll be pretty girls on the island. Oh! Your friends will also be there. Damodharan will be the foreman. Veerankutty said they will be leaving on coming friday after Jumu'ah. I promised that you'd be there. Don't refuse, Ajmal. Oh, grandfather! 'PRANAYA MEENUKALUDE KADAL'(THE SEA OF LOVE FISH) This is Haider To the islanders, he's 'Shark Idhru Born and brought up in sea Long back, at night, unable to bear labor pain, his mother Thithumma, walked into the sea and gave birth to him. Island's black pearl. Lying on the sea bed, he grew up watching sunrise,moonlight and stars. The old and the new generations of the island unanimously say that, no one has ever been born on the island who can hunt sharks like Idhru. Before the British, Lakshadweep was reigned by Arakkal queens. The present Arakkal family. Though they have lost their old prosperity, Arakkal women are still dear to the islanders. The head of the present Arakkal family Beevi Noorjahan. Idhru grew up playing at Arakkal house along with Beevumma's daughter Sulfath. He didn't have a world other than the sea or Arakkal Beevumma. He was always a loyal kitten at the feet of Beevi. Come on. Come and hold this. Come on, hold it. Hold it. Hold it. How much does it weight? Just eat it. They want to know everything. Idhru, make it fast. This isn't any fruit. In India, Lakshadweep is the place which has low crime rate. Once in a while a theft or squabble would happen. Abdhurab, I hope you know that. Sir, you'd said the same when I stole bronze vessels from Saidali's once. Yes. What did I do on that day? Saidali and I were called here.And you solved the issue. And you made me return the vessels to him. You put an end to my bread and butter. -Isn't it? -Yes. That is what I'm going to do today also. That's why I asked Alikoya to come here. That day I also got whacks from Shivankutty sir. Sir, shall I do the same today? That would be great. -Abdhurab... -Yes? You return these silvervessels to Alikoya yourself. Sir, I also have to live. That's why I got you a job at Arakkal. Do work and live, Abdhurab. It's been ten months sinceI took charge here. No case has been registered at this station until today. This station should get into the Guinness book for being the station without any cases. That's his aim. Isn't it, sir? That's not a bad aim. Have you got any doubts? No, sir. Hey, what's it, Idhru? Sir, finish your work. Alikoya, you can leave. Abdhurab, you too. So, isn't there anything from Shivankutty sir today? We're giving you concession today in the belief that you won't repeat it. Alikoya, give him a hundred rupees. He took so much trouble. Why should I pay him for stealing my goods? What kind of law is that? There's such a law, Alikoya. Go. Hey, Alikoya... Go now. You also go. Idhru, is that a giant shark? Won't you give me? Such a glutton! Go and get it from Moidheen at the beach. What's that? Sir, a shark weighing 150 kg. He tried to play with me. But I didn't leave him. Aren't you smart? How can the shark get away from you? Mariyumma, don't butter him. Your share will be brought to your house. What's it, Idhru? Any good luck? I got these from it. Idhru, you'll corrupt me. Susan is letting me stay on this island, thanks to these pearlsbrought by you occasionally. Why don't you give this to your Arakkal beevi? She doesn't like it. She says God won't forgive. What a man you are! You'd kill all those poor creatures in the sea. They're also God's creation. Big fish eat small fish. I catch those big fish. That's also God's game, Beevumma. Abdhu, did the police leave you? Is it true that you stole silvervessels from Alikoya's house? That was a mistake from my side. You won't change. It's because Inspector told that I hired you to work here. And now, are you embarrassing me also? Don't I've six daughters? Don't make people call them thief Abdhurab's daughters. In spite of Beevumma paying you. He's got used to stealing. That's why. You must have got thrashings from them, right? Go and get some medicine from Sulu. They didn't do anything today.They let me go. Ayisha sister, you don't have any problem. No, dear. Sometimes I feel a giddiness. I went to the toilet several times. That's not the real issue. It's an excuse to bunkJasmine's class, isn't it? What's the use of studying to read and write at this age? My daughter-in-law is doing this to trouble me. It's not her. I'm the one who asked her to send you for the class. Sulfath, please give me a tablet. Or else my daughter-in-law won't believe. How are you, Ayisha sister? Oh, I'm not well. -Aslam alaikku. -Va alaikum aslam. When did you return from Calicut? Today morning. -Didn't you go to hospital? -I've to go. I've duty in the afternoon. Okay. Where's Beevumma? She's there inside. Aslam alaikkum. Va alaikkum aslam. Those boat builders will reach tomorrow. -How many are there? -Around ten. Where will they stay? Your coconut shed is vacant, right? Just clean it for them. Alright. Idhru, inform Iyathu and other workers. The Kavaratti girl is extremely beautiful She's the darling of the sea mother Adorns a veil fashioned from coconut leaves She has a body made of sweet milk In the water where waves come rushing The girl comes batting her eyelids The tresses coming up to her knees look attractive Her smile breaks into night in the sky The Kavaratti girl is extremely beautiful She's the darling of the sea mother She came swimming ashore bashful like a mermaid Spoke a hundred things in the beautiful Jasari language Her thoughts linger on this land like warm breeze This island welcomes the guests by serving honey Even if melancholy pains her,she hops on a merry boat The Kavaratti girl is extremely beautiful She's the darling of the sea mother Adorns a veil fashioned from coconut leaves She has a body made of sweet milk What's happening? We're shooting a music video for our college. A song by island girls. Idhru, jump into the sea. Just jump. This soul is full of red coral which is love The melody of the heart which came accompanied by dhol music Her dreams are waxing like these sand The glossy desires come roaring in the mind sea shells Looking towards the east, she sat waiting The Kavaratti girl is extremely beautiful She's the darling of the sea mother Adorns a veil fashioned from coconut leaves She has a body made of sweet milk In the water where waves come rushing The girl comes batting her eyelids The tresses coming up to her knees look attractive Her smile breaks into night in the sky -Grandmother... -Yes? Isn't that boat a remembrance of your old love? Once the work finishes, they will take it, right? How are you? How was the journey? Yes, it was good. It rained at night. In the election rally of 2014, Rahul Gandhi made defamatory statements about RSS... Father is alone at home. Do visit him. Ayisha sister will go and prepare food. Okay. You should go and feed him on time. Okay. When are you returning? Day after tomorrow. Also, you should go and keep him company at night. Take him to the toilet also. -Hey, is your vacation over? -It'll get over tomorrow. -Uncle, are you going to Kochi? -Yes. It's not like the last time.This place has changed. -Isn't it? -Yes. All pretty girls! It's a good omen. Ansari, when are you returning? I need a favour. My ship will leave now. They have come to repair the Arakkal boat. Okay. He's the most educated man on this island. But he's a little eccentric also. -Good morning, sir. -Where are you off to? Why is he asking me? -There're twelve people in total, right? -Yes. Isn't it for three months? It's there in it, right? You won't get this tea in Beppur. This is Thithumma's special tea. The boat builders. This is the foreman... Damodhran. Sit down. Do sit. Have tea. I'd come to Beppur with my parents when this boat was being built. I was around twelve years old then. Beppur and Calicut are not the same now. You don't have to say. I know it. 'Naak'? What's that? It means 'I'. Oh, do you know this language? - Of course. -Don't you have class today? -No. I saw Ansari getting on the ship to Kochi. They have come from Beppur to repair the boat. This is Beevumma's granddaughter. Jasmine. Oh. JASMINE... What's this! This has more work than I thought. See, the bottom part has worn out. This can't be done in three months. It'd take at least six months. Or else I'll need more people. You just do accordingly. The deal is that it should reach Qatar before Bakrid. Start your work tomorrow itself. Okay. That's Usman's tea shop. You can eat from there. I've informed him. We'll prepare the dinner ourselves. We've brought rice and other things with us. Just get us some utensils. -Rahim.. -Yes, brother.. Get them whatever they need either from my house or Arakkal. Okay. I'll go home now and come back in the evening. Who's your leader? It's me. What's it, sir? What's your name? Damodharan. Here, sir. There are criminal cases against two people back in Kerala. Who's Gireesh Kumar? On bail, right? Yes. Haven't you been reporting at Calicut police station every week? Then how you got permit? I got concession for two months. Oh, political influence! Weren't you supposed to report at our police station as soon as you reach here? Why didn't you come? That... What was the case? Stabbing case. Nice. I didn't do anything, sir. It's just that I was also present. You don't have to say that here. You must come once a week to the station and report. Got it? Ajmal, son of Beppur Kandel Muhammad Ali. Sir, please come down. What's the case against him? Just shut up. What's your case? A squabble at the theater. Sir, it was a row between fans associations. He's Mohanlal's fan. Is it? I'm also Mohanlal's fan. That doesn't mean there's a case. One guy howled at Mohanlal in the theater. I lost my control. We got into an argument when the movie got over. I hit him with my helmet. He had twelve stitches. I didn't know he was DYSP's son. There are no theaters here to form fans association. -Don't you know that? -Yes. Is there anyone else like this? Let me tell you something. All these can't be done here. Got it? Lakshadweep has the lowest number of crimes in India. No murder has happened in the history of Kavaratti. Only three murders have happened on Lakshadweep so far. Two at Androth island and one at Kalpeni island. It's been ten months since I took charge over here. So far, I didn't have to charge any case. He compromised everything. As long as I'm here, don't come up with any gimmicks. Got it? Oh, come inside Ayisha sister. Leave me, dear. Jasmu, I'm not well. I can't breathe. Stop playing. Sit here. Kabir, reduce the volume. Always watching the samemovie again and again. Umbu, stop playing. I've to take class. Brother, how's your gastric problem? It's okay. Did you take the medicine my mother gave you? Yes. I also have gastric issues. Oh! Have you written your names like I said yesterday? Yes. Show me. Okay. It's not Mallakoya. It's Mullakoya. Oh, what a loafer! I've got wheezing. That's why. No need of acting. Write. Write down. Uncle! Have you come? My old professor from Maharaja's college passed away. He was a great man. I couldn't tell you while going. What's this? A belt for your radio? So that I don't lose it anywhere. I don't need to worry now. You don’t use mobile phones. Or else you could have listened to songs using headset. This has a special buzzing sound. That's a pleasure. Also nostalgia. Continue your class. I'll sit here. Aslam Alaikkum! Wa alaikum salam. Write down. Sea... Show your hand. Oh, you've spoiled itby adding all the salt. Can't put it in mouth. What kind of a fisherman are you? Don't even know to prepare a fish curry. Why are you making me do women's work? Who told you to bring fish here? Yassar told Ayisha sister would come and prepare food. I'm going. I've other things to do. You've to give attend anceat Beevumm's, right? Don't talk about Beevumma. She was Arakkal queen in the past. Now all of us are equal. You're still her slave! -Have you come? -What happened? Even though he's paralyzed his tongue has no issues. When I came here, he was lying drenched in urine and feces. I bathe him and changed his clothes. After all your father is mine also. -What happened? -Make me do things that I know. Did he make you prepare food? See if it's too salty. How was your journey? It was good. You became alone for two days, right? Taste it. I'm going. Wait there. Jasmine and I'll prepare the fish curry. You take it inside. Here. Haven't you been sitting here for some time? Let's go inside. Poor guy. He bath me and changed the bed He'd bear everything. But we shouldn’t say anything about his Beevumma. That's because you're a communist. But he doesn't understand it.That's the problem. You're not educated like your son, right? Weren't you also a fisherman like me? You missed two days of class, right? Did you complete the essay? Not at all. I was lazy. I'll bring it tomorrow. You should finish it tomorrow itself. Sulfath said you've become lazy in studies. This isn't a college, is it? Gurukul education in your words. So this will do. Right? That's not enough queen Jasmine. Since you’re my student,I should be proud of you. Thank you. Did you finish reading Marquez's book? Love in the time of Cholera, right? I finished it long back itself. I'm leaving. Are you coming? You go now and come tomorrow. What about the fish curry? I'll take care of it. Shall we check out the dhow's work? Go over there. Give him a hand. Hey, what did you do? Come down. Are you calling me? Aren't you the one who threw away that bottle? The tourists and others who come here have polluted the sea by throwing plastic into it. We, islanders have been trying to clean it up. Do you know that? Can I take a selfie? For what? Well, aren't you the collector of this island? Give me that phone. What? Give me that phone. Enter the password. You thought I didn't notice it, right? Don't play your tricks on the island. Isn't the fish curry ready? Oh no. It smells good. All of you keep playing on the phone. Am I your cook? Kunjandi, are you also on the phone? Come and fry the pappad. I'm coming. What's it? The fish is well cooked. You Calicut people are superb cooks. What's this? You were here yesterday also. Like a cat. I'm Abdhurab. You told that yesterday also. Muthukoya has told me to help you people. We know to look after ourselves. But that's not how things should be. I also have responsibility. What? What are you doing? I forgot to take bowl from home. Keep it there. Where did you keep the coconut oil? I've taken six pieces. There should be enough for everyone. I've got six daughter at home. Brother, should I fry these pappads? I'll bring the bowl back tomorrow. There's network only once in a while. Don't know if there will be rice at home. How can I ask you that also? I'll come tomorrow. This is the state of oceans around the world. That's what is happening to our island also. The fish and corals inthe sea will be extinct. This is why these children are running behind it. But it's still lying there as a pile. We don't see any interest from your side to remove it. Plastic-free island sounds good. Your enthusiasm is also good. But what do you expect me to do with it? Should I ship it to some enemy country? Sir, are you teasing us? I'd sent mails to responsible people when you told this the other day. I didn't even get a reply. The solution has to come from higher authorities. I respect you youngsters. There will be some way.Don't lose your spirit. I'll close the shop by eight. You should return it before that. It's one fifty rupees per bike for a day. It's six o' clock now. Shall we return this tomorrow? How much for it? I'm giving this because you are Muthukoya's men. If something happens to the bikes, I won't be the same. Mainlanders go blind when they get their hands on bikes. Brother, get off my bike and hop onto Koyamon's bike. -But Gireesh is there on it. -Sit behind him. Why did you show attitude when I asked for a selfie? Where's my video you took the other day? Is it there on your phone? Delete it. Or should I take it from you and delete? Who's this? I haven't seen him here before. He's from mainland. Our island will not have such people. Son, better leave. Or else you won't have your limbs when you go home. Aandi brother... Yes? Why did I become silent before her? Is this how we behave during such situations? Hey, no. Brother, is this how you behave? No, right? What could be the reason then? Ah! I stood there and gaped at her. What could be the reason? She has gotten inside my heart. I still haven't gotten over my past relationship. I'm drinking this to get over it. In between that he's coming up with his love. That was your fate. If she can forget the 10 year long relationship byseeing a rich guy, then you also don't need her. Leave it. Gireesh, only if one decays, it'd become fertilizer for the next. That's the science of love. It's similar to the science of boats. Both have accurate measurements. Hey.... Hide it. Oh, he saw us. What's this? Don't you know liquor is prohibited here? It's a crime to have liquoror carry it on the island. From where did you get this? When we came from Kerala... Take it. -What? -That bottle. All different brands. How many more bottles are there? No more, sir. A couple of them might be there. Tell me the truth. Sir, there are six bottles in total. I'd counted, sir. How did you manage to bring it here? I hid it inside the rice sack. Pour me one. What? Pour me one glass. Oh God! Don't remember the last time I smelt it. You don't know my pain. The ship from Kochi comes twice a week and halts here at night. SI gets to celebrate then. Captain would invite him to the ship. The ship is at sea, right? Hence there's no liquor ban. And the rest of us have to go for night duty bearing mosquito bites. Pour one more. -Captain...-Yes? This island life is good except that we don't get liquor. I get to sleep during duty hours enjoying the sea breeze, that too in uniform. Is it possible in anyother station in India? I also have friends in police. They say happiness is thrashing someone in the lock-up and having two pegs later. That's their happiness and this is mine. Mother... Mother... Mother... Didn't you sleep yet? Where have you been? Don't smile. Didn't you say you don't need a wife or family. Aren't you ashamed to goto Kunjathu's at night? You serve dinner. Didn't she give you anything to eat? She got an opportunity when her husband left her. You're neither afraid of the people nor ashamed about it. But being your mother, I'm ashamed. She's started! What's this noise at night? Are you guys not sleeping? Who's it? Who are you to make us sleep? Why are you becoming vexed? I was just joking. Oh, are you a comedian? What's happening inside? Move aside. What's on television? Is it blue film? Who are you to ask that? You're asking us? Have you seen Beppur? Have you seen Calicut? Have you heard of 'Khalasi'? Khalasi? If you show attitude we'll take this island and place it in Calicut. Switch on the television. Didn't you hear? Switch it on. You must all obey Aandi brother. Switch on the television. Who wants to see this. Play blue film. Go from here without causing trouble. What if we don't leave? Who wanted to watch blue film? Didn't you hear? Who was it? It was Aandi brother. See his desire! Move aside. You can get into brawls back home. Not here. I told the other day itself. They are all living here in peace and harmony. If you show attitude, I'll send you back. Weren't you all drunk yesterday night? Tell me. Didn't you make commotion after getting drunk? How did you manage to get it? Tell me the truth. Don't you know it's prohibited on this island? Is that why you have it at sea?On the ship? Who told you? It's just a joke. Leave it. Why should we drag sea and ship into this? Let's come to the case. So your complaint is they came to the club,caused trouble and got into a fight. Okay. I got it.They're the trouble makers. They were drunk, sir. But we don't have proof for it. Not just that. This is a prohibited area. Even if it's true, they won't repeat it. -Right? -Yes, sir. That's not the issue. If suppose I register a case based on your complaint, they'll leave once their work gets over. They have nothing to lose.The loss is ours. We'll lose the credit for being the police station, that hasn't registered any case in the last 10 months. This island will lose its good name. So let's forgive them for this time. Okay? Got it? If you repeat this, I'll smash your bowels. So we've compromised it. Isn't it, Mariyumma? You useless dog! How dare you stand in front of me?(Dialogue from a Malayalam movie) That inspector is not fair. Compromising the cases! He wants to get into the Guinness book. This is our prestige issue, Idhru. They happened to be Muthukoya's people. Or else we would have handled them ourselves. We don't sharpen our knives for anything other than cutting fish. That is what we've been doing. But if someone tries to extinguish the peace on this island... You people are not required. My knife alone will do. We just want to hear that. That's why we came to you. They are working on the Arakkal boat, right? I'll keep an eye on them. They will leave once the repair work gets over. Muthukoya had told that a couple of them are troublemakers. One of them took Jasmine's photo. She took the phone from him and deleted it. Yes, she told me about it. They can't play their tricks on her. But still... You keep an eye on them. Beevumma... Muthukoya and Musaliyar have come. As-salamu alaykum. Wa alaikum salaam. What happened, Beevumma? Why did you ask for me? I want to tell something. It used to happen during my father's time every year without any failure. Arakkal family members from all over Lakshadweep used to gather here once in a year. It's been sometime now. It just stopped. Everyone stopped visiting one another. I hope you know the reason. That has to change. Well, there's a reason for it. A proposal has come for Jasmine from Kasim Koya's family in Androth. God, that's good news. When's the marriage? The groom is studying abroad. We're planning to do it after he finishes his studies. We should invite their family also. Let's make it a grand affair with music and dance. Musaliyar, you have to be present with people from the mosque. You know that, don't you? Alahamdulillah! I hope at least this wedding takes place at Arakkal. Nobody from this generation has taken part in a marriage here. Usthad, you had snacks? Yes. Then please leave. Isn't it time for afternoon prayer? Don't teach me when to give prayer call. Go and wait outside. I want to speak to Beevumma. When Jasmine was young, we all enjoyed seeing her swimming and diving in the sea. People even said she'd get medal if she participates in Olympics. Now she has grown up and become a girl. But why didn't you tellher to stop everything? She still swims and dives in front of people. Is it allowed in our community? Tell me. People are talking about it at the mosque. People haven't forgotten the ill name that was brought to Arakal by you and your daughter Musaliyar, please have your tea and leave. Jasmine is not an ordinary girl like you think. She has the courage that Sulfath and I didn't have. Eat it. Are you eating, Koya? No, Usman. I'm going home. Hey, Koya brother... There's Arakkal family's get together function. On next Friday. Their relatives from Ameniand Kalpeni are coming. It's a big function. You people come there after work. Beevumma has specially invited all. There will be music and dance. You can have your dinner there. Heard that you got into a brawl with the boys from here. Damodharan, didn't you get anyone better? Boys these days won't listen to us. Did you take Jasmine's photo? You happened to be Imbichikka's grandson. Or else I would have given you a tight slap across your face. Why are you laughing? I didn't change even when mygrandfather and headmaster advised me. You think I'd listen to you? My guardian, the boat of my life which is an ocean My guardian My guardian, the boat of my life which is an ocean My guardian As essence The poetic nectar that was written on the petal of my life as essence The poetic nectar that was writtenon the petal of my life as essence My guardian, the boat ofmy life which is an ocean My guardian Are you the madness dancing inside the seashell as pearl? Is it you? Are you the smile of the blooming corals inside the destructive sea? As the beating of the heart Will you hear the rhythm of life that touches the heart as heart beats Where's Jasmine? Upstairs. Call her. Beevumma is calling. Come. Kasim Koya Hajji's sister from Androth. She's the groom's aunt. My guardian, the boat of my life which is an ocean My guardian These lives and dreams are like flower petals It gets dropped and vanishes on the earth These lives and dreams getseperated and conjoined It gets finished and wilted on this earth You must have seen this scene in many films, right? What do you want? Have you seen Thattathin Marayath? I've watched it twenty times. You look like the heroine in that movie. Leave. Or else I'll make noise. Didn't you delete the photos from my phone the other day? I've more of it now. Why did you take it? Simply. If you have whatsapp,I'll forward it to you. Along with few of my cool photos. Delete it. Else I'll call Idhru. Oh, don't spoil. Hey, wait. Move back. Why did you take my photos? Love. What else it would be? As the vivacity of each morning Where's the other boy? Who? Ajmal? Yes. Yes, where's he? He's gone to pee. Right? Do you need so much time to pee? My guardian She's calling you. Who? Ajmal, do you know anything about me? Well, you're this island's princess... Arakkal's young queen.. -Then? -Then what? Your marriage has been fixed with some islander. You'll get married when his studies gets over. Villains like this are there in every movie. But he'd leave you at the end. Love at first sight happens only in movies, right? No. It isn't. It happens in real life also. It'd happen, right? My friends are studying in mainland. They always say... boys over there fall in love with girls easily. Is it so? Isn't that an illness, Ajmal? That's why my grandmother did not send me there for studies. I haven't seen Kerala. Sometimes... I'd be the only girl like that of my age. Whenever I make a fuss, she asks me what I lack here. Then I ask her if there are shopping malls, multiplex or metro train here. There's a reply which she gives me always. She'd say there are good-hearted people here. And it's not there in your land. Is it true, Ajmal? Why are saying this to me? My great grandfather got that dhow built. Long back, when my great grandfather returned from Kozhikode, he brought a singer along with him on the boat. My grandmother fell in love with the singer and his song. One day the singer went back to Calicut on the boat and never returned. Grandmother waited for him in vain. My mother was born out of wedlock. She brought my mother up alone. Educated her.... Later, my mother went to Mangalore to study medicine. When she returned to Kavartti after finishing MBBS and house surgency, there was a baby in her hand. That was me. I haven't seen my Bappa (father). Not bappa, 'achan'. It was an inter-caste marriage. Even though my mother loved and married him secretly, my grandmother forgave her eventually. When they were coming to the island with me for the first time, my father tripped from the ship and fell into the sea. It's said women of Arakkal have such a curse on them. Husbands from land won't survive. So my grandmother took a vow. That I won't be shown mainland. Now someone has come from Beppur with love. Sounds like an old film story. Leave me alone. Repair my great grandfather's boat properly and return to Beppur... ...and marry a pretty girl from Calicut. Delete those photos. Please wait. In movies, this kind of dialogue are told by superstars. If suppose the heroine says such a dialogue, not just the superstars, even the new gen hero's would say a dialogue back. You might be the princess of thisisland, Arakkal's young queen... But I didn't fall in love with you because of that. It's because of your beauty. Every hero in this world has theright to love beautiful heroines. And this story about the curse on arakkal women. New generation boys like me won't buy it. Regarding status... I might be a boat carpenter now... A bloody boat carpenter! Dear... I have appeared in a dozen films. This is how Mammotty, Mohanlaland Rajanikanth became superstars. I'll also have a day. Wait and watch. Once I become a super star, this small princess might not interest me. It's better the romanceand marriage happen soon. Shall I leave? And he walked away in slow motion. Let him walk like that for now. So far, your side is clear. This is enough. But be cautious of him. He's a lunatic wanting to get into movies. He might come again in slow motion on a horse or flying saucer. Leave him. I got to know recently about the story in which you walked in slow motion. What? I'll tell something if you won't scold me. Yes, tell me. I'd come here on the day you went to Kochi. I didn't know you had gone. While dusting the books on the shelf, I saw something. What did you see? I accidentally saw it. I didn't do it purposefully. Several letters. Unposted letters addressed to Manipal medical college from Maharajas college. It's there only. I didn't open. Were you in love with Dr. Sulfath? It wasn't love. We used to go together on the ship to college. How come my mother never knew about it? Jasmine, don't mention this to her. It was just a passing fancy. Why didn't you post any of those letters? I'm a fisherman's son. We belong to lower caste. Then why did you keep those letters safely? Come. Take your book and study. Beevumma is sending you here because of me. Come on. We'll continue. It's because of you and grandmother I wasnot sent out of this island for studies. I know. It was your grandmother's decision.I don't have any role in it. But still you have feelings for Sulfath, haven't you? Jasmu, stop it. Dude... Doesn't the water look like mirror? Look over there. Asma, are you coming? No. I'm playing games. Okay. Here. -Aandi brother, not that. - It's full of corals here. Guys, you go. I'll come. Hey.. -Has he gone mad? -Ajmal! Rascal! What did you do? I didn't do anything. Is it? Then what's it that I saw? What did you see? Idhru, don't do anything. Don't play your tricks on the island. This is used to kill sharks. I'll shove this into your stomach. Idhru, leave them. Nobody's blood have been spilled on this island yet. Don't make me do it. Fraud! What's the matter? Sir... Have you started your hooliganism again to trouble me? Idhru, what happened? Sir, in the sea, he... I didn't do anything, sir. I was taking a bath in the sea. Hey... I don't know how to swim properly. When I was drowning, she came and saved me. Sir, ask her if you have doubt. Are you lying after doing wicked things? -Idhru... -No sir. Ask her. I might have grabbed her while struggling to breathe. That's all. Oh God! Aren't you relieved now? Idhru... The problem has been solved. This was the issue. Is this why you became furious? He... He's lying. The case is that she was trying to save a life. He might have grabbed her in between that. -Isn't that natural? -Yes. After all Jasmine doesn’thave any complaints. That's why she left without saying anything. Isn't it? So Idhru, isn't it over? Hey, boy... If you get into this sea again without learning to swim, you'll have to face the consequences. Everyone disperse. Yes, the problem has been compromised. Maybe he was lying. Or the problem was with Idhru's eyes. Anyway it has happened. Let's not make it an issue on the island. That boy is little wicked. I understood that when he arrived. I'll send him back from tomorrow itself. My eyes do not have any problem.He was lying. You're just going too far. Don't go with your spear to fight with the boys from Beppur. Don't bite my head off. I'm sending him back. This island and the islanders have a way of living. That got disrupted after you arrived here. On top of that, this boy is causing trouble for no reason. This won't work, Damodharan. Send Ajmal back tomorrow itself. And bring someone better if you want. Or else Arakkal women won't be able to sleep. And Idhru will continue to be irked. Brother, let's not have tuna curry today. I've got bored of eating it. What a boy! Idhru won't say anything simply. Who was lying? He knows how to swim. So why didn't you say it then? Now everyone thinks he was saying the truth. Idhru would have killed him. You're a grown up girl.Don't forget that. What did he do? Mom... Enough. He'll go back tomorrow. We haven't bought the story that she was helping you when you were drowning. Is sea new for Beppur boys? What did you do to her underwater? Tell us that. What? I hugged and gave her a kiss. It's really nice to kiss underwater. We have seen it only inEnglish films, right? Haven't you seen titanic? Oh, 'liplock'. Oh God! Aandi brother, haven't we seen pretty girls in Calicut? But when I think of her, an electric current passes through my body. It's better you go back. Or else these islanders will thrash you to death. Let them kill. I won't leave even if they kill me. How can I go leaving her? But you aren't going.They're sending you back. Oh God! What was he saying while coming here? He was cribbing there are no theaters or multiplexes here. All these are still therein Calicut, Ajmal. Go pack your things and leave tomorrow. Here. Ajmal can't enter this island anymore. Not just to Kavaratti. But to all the islands in Lakshadweep. It's an unfortunate event. Go. Your ship is at four. I'd told you to behave properly when you arrived itself. You didn't listen. What can we do now? Don't look at me. You should have thought about it while doing mischief. Why are you looking at him? Is he a magistrate? Take it. I came here to work on three months permit. So why should I leave now? Am I not doing work? What mistake did I make? Is there any complaint against me? Is there a case? Case... There's no case. You can't charge a case. Because you will lose your record. So let's compromise it. Isn't it, sir? Is it right to send someone back without any proper reason? So Muthukoya, what doyou want me to do now? I like your island a lot. I'm not going back. Isn't this also India? Am I not an Indian citizen, sir? So don't try to send me back. Okay then. Wait, I'm also coming. -Sir? -Yes. Hey, come. Come my boy. Come here. Sir, why did you call me? I called only you. Why did he come? You leave. Out! Have one peg. No thanks. I don't drink. Don't drink? You've never drank? Well, only if Mohanlal's films become super hit or flop. Nice! So you drink if you feel happy or sad. Didn't you win today? That means it's a happy day. So have one. No, sir. I usually have two pegs when I come here.Maximum three pegs. Today I've had six pegs. Don't you know the reason for it? Now drink this. Sir, pour one more. Nice! He's a fraud. He won't leave just like that. It's getting late. You go home. His blood will spill on this island. You please relax, Idhru. Nothing has happened here to kill him. It shouldn't happen. You make sure of it. What happened? That moron Who? You go to bed. Aliyakka, how are you? It's been so long since I saw you. I was busy at the hospital. Aren't you doing the exercise? Haven't I told you? He's lazy. Sulfath, don't worry. He'll leave when his work gets over. Take it easy. Jasmine doesn't have anything like that. I know that. But still.... His presence over here... A girl's mind can change. You're underestimating her. She's very bold. I feel guilty when I think of her. Because of the mistakes that mother and I did in the past... She's getting punished. She has become a caged bird by not going out of this island. Leave it. She doesn't have any problem. More that any other girl on this island, she has life experience. Tea would become cold. Did you see the video on youtube? Yes, I saw it on that day itself. It became viral. Already five lakhs people have watched it. Fathu has become a star. She got a chance to sing in Shaan Rahman's movie. -Really? -Yes. Oh God! Superb Hey, heard that you got into trouble with some guy from mainland. Leave it. From where did you buy this? Lulu mall? Well, boys from mainland easily fall in love. Girls are also not bad. Everyone in my batch has boyfriend. Fathu also had two boyfriends at a time. Saki is also not bad. She also has a boyfriend. Really? Just for time pass.Until the course gets over. Jasmine, how's your sea lover? Is he handsome? I don't know. Has romance started for you? But isn't it molestation? Oh, stop it. So, it's not molestation? Then it'd be consensual. What's that? Haven't you heard of it in new discussions? Consensual. What the hell is that? It means it's done with consent. Where are you? At Sakeena's house. Go home fast. Grandmother is calling you. Okay. I'm going. Wait. Did you see him after that? No. Take that plank. Keep a plank in that gap. Get me that nail. Hold this. Where are you rushing to? I'll be right back. Hey, stop. I've been waiting to see you. Move. Let me go. Hey... Only some more work is left. I'll leave after that. I've told my family that this angel will also be there at home for the next Bakrid. It's true. I told them. I sent your photo also. They all liked you a lot. So? Have you decided it yourself? That's why I told you now. Give me a reply fast. Wait there. Most probably I'll be the hero in Aashiq Abu's next film. It'd be difficult to get a hold of me after that. Oh God! Idhru! Come. What are you doing? Come. Sit here. Hey, wait. Don't go. Come here. Leave me. Don't we look like Karuthammaand Pareekutty from Chemeen? I'm trapped. Grandmother will kill me today. This is God's game. This is a good opportunity. You can confess your love now. Maybe it was because we were underwater that I behaved like a villain the other day. Forget it. It's because I love you. I couldn't control when I found you on that day. Please forgive. You also have feelings for me. Isn't that why you didn'tsay anything to Idhru? This is how you fall in love. Haven't we seen it in movies? Jasmine, you have muddled up things. Karuthamma and Parikutty from Chemeen! God, where would this end? How will I know? When we walk on the beach like this, we'd feel like dipping our feet in the water. But when the waves come near us, we'd go back spontaneously so that we don't get wet. The waves would come again. Then it'd be a Kabbadi game between our legs and waves. How much ever we go backward,eventually a wave would wet our feet. Love is also like these waves which keep coming back. No poet in this world has said such a definition about love. So let's keep a distance from these waves. Did you understand? When the beloved blue sky sang in the ears Did the deep sea become a shy damsel You prolong my life every now and then Did the mind become a pigeon of clouds You're a ruby flower on the island of desire I see you as my dream a lot Like the buzzing of a white sea shell I hear you often, my life When the beloved blue sky sang in the ears Did the deep sea become a shy damsel You prolong my life every now and then Did the mind become a pigeon of clouds Are you married? No. Have you been in love? No. No, right? This is because of that. In the sweet eyes of the blue ocean I'm swimming as a flower fish, my dear You sowed in me a desire to try rowing Without knowing the whirlpool,I got lost and went faraway Without letting me escape,you came as a heart Will you embrace me with waves, love? When I start to build the dhow, The breeze comes to narrate a tale I'll write a line, will you sing in my ears When the beloved blue sky sang in the ears Did the deep sea become a shy damsel You prolong my life every now and then Did the mind become a pigeon of clouds I tried walking backwards several times. But the waves are coming like a tsunami. What will I do? My mind is like our island now. There is sea all around it. Even if I walk forward or backward, there are only waves. Jasmine, you've put me also in deep sea. Everyone in love would feel like trapped on an island, right? If you want, you still have time to swim back ashore. He'll leave when they finish repairing the boat. You should also forget everything with that. Just an infatuation. Nothing has happened beyond that. Jasmine, let's make this a fantasy. Like a fairytale you read long back. A boat carpenter comes from some land and falls in love with a mermaid. A fat boat as the symbol of their love. And along with some imagination we can write a novel. Let's give it a name also. Love in the time of typhoid. Oh, comedy! Uncle, I'm confused. That's what I said. If it's now, you can easily put an end to it. Just press a button and it'll all get deleted. Come. I'll take you home today. Get up. It's been so long since I had Thithumma's tea. Come on. Let's go. Uncle... I'm serious. I'm in love. I don't know anything about Ajmal's family or his background. But still, I love him. Uncle, will you stand with me? You leave. It's not safe to go there anymore. [an old Hindi film song] Isn't this the song that your singer sang all over the island? How long did it take for you to fall in love with him? One week? One day? Or as soon as you heard that song for the first time? Why are you asking me this? I can't lie to you. Jasmu, tell me. What happened? It's what you felt for that singer. What's it, Jasmu? Don't worry. I won't make the same mistake like you both. I didn't want it. I didn't want it at all. But... First it was grandmother. Later mom... Now it's me. Who's he? What's he? Do you know anything? A third rate labor from somewhere. Just a labor! Mom, why are you talking like this? It's so cheap. Then how should I say? Don't you know everything? About my life and mother's life. And now you're also... You have destroyed my peace of mind. Mother, didn't you hear her? At least she didn't become like you. She said what's on her mind. Dear, go and sleep. Only painting and machineworks are left now. It'll get over in ten days. We're planning to take it to sea after that. Khalasis will be coming from Beppur for it. Do come and see it when you get time before it's taken from here. The Arab will come after Bakrid. Hassankoya told it'll be taken to Qatar after he comes. Come, Beevumma is calling you. Get on. You'd drown if you fall into the sea, right? He knows how to swim. So were you lying to Idhru the other day? Did you tell Jasmine that she'd be there with your family for the next Bakrid? Yes. Are you serious? I'm serious. If she comes. Did she say she'd come? So that's just your dream. She likes me. You made her like you. What's wrong in that? That's my cleverness. Are you that smart? Where are you taking me on this boat? People like you've come here from the mainland in the past also. They left only after making the women over here cry. Myself... Idhru's mother... Sulfath too, even thoughit was on the land... If you're going to make Jasmine also sad, even if you're smart, you won't leave this island. You'll be killed. Idhru will kill you. Don't laugh. Nobody has killed anyone on this island until now. The first body that's going to fall on this land... Let it not be yours, Ajmal. Put it over there. Yes, keep moving. Hello... I want to talk. Idhru is here. And others also. I want to talk now itself.I'm there behind you. Today is my last day on this island. I'll wait near that dilapidated ship. Yes, move it. Uncle, come with me. What? It's urgent. Come on. Hop on. We're going to uncle's house.Will be back soon. -Get off. -What? Get off. I took you along so that Idhru doesn't become dubious. Stay here for sometime. Jasmine, someone will see. Come. Hey... Jasmine... Will you come with me? Though I was joking then, I'm serious now. I'll take you. I'll surely take you. I'm serious. This time I'm taking my son also. Ansari, why are you standing here alone? Nothing. Just checking to see if America can be seen from here. Don't you see? Have you gone mad again? God, he's crazy. All these while I thought love was just for fun. So I fell in love with all the girls I met. It was like that when I saw you for the first time. But now... God promise. Only you are there on my mind now. Even if someone opposes, it won't go. I still can't believe you also love me. It's as if I'm seeing a dream. A girl like you in love with a guy like me... If we wish for something ardently,we'd get it no matter what it is. Mohanlal has told so in one movie. You must come. When the boat leaves tomorrow you should be there with me. I'll take you with me. Ajmal, do you've that much courage? Can you take me without bothering about Beevumma, my mother or Idhru? Beevumma thinks that she can send me from here by threatening me. Let Idhru come to kill me. Let's see whose dead body is goingto fall on this island first. Beevumma has commissioned Idhru to kill me. Come. Start the bike. Start the bike. Will you kill him? Will you kill Ajmal if grandmother ask you to? Tell him to return without causing trouble. If Beevumma says, I'll kill him. You are a dog! Just a dog at grandmother's feet! I'm a dog. Just a dog at Beevumma's feet. Did you eat anything? No. What's his name? Sreekumar. Were you classmates? Yes. Did you get married? We did register marriage. It's been one and a half years. Doesn't his family have any problems? They are against this. What should I say to all those who're asking why you aren't back even after finishing your course? Mother... Please forgive me. When you were born out of wedlock, and when the islanders made fun of me, I never felt I was a loser. When my father died thinking of me, I cried a lot. After that, in this life, Beevi Noorjahan hasn't cried. I haven't bowed my head before anyone. Now should I cry out of shame because of you? Tell me. I didn't do it to defeat you. I didn't have the courage to tell this to you. I believed that what happened to me would never happen to my daughter. It was when people started to talk all over the island, I came here with Idhru. Let whomever be your daughter's father. We should show to islanders that there's such a person. You should come to the island with him. At least once. Didn't you sleep? You please sleep. You smoke a lot, right? This is one habit that I haven't been able to change. Idhru, here's a big shark! Idhru! Oh God! How did you feel like doing it? Please don't make me mad by asking questions. I just did what Beevumma told. All these years I kept it inside me. I can't do it anymore. I was going crazy. That's why I told you. You're not the one who's crazy.It's that old woman. This is not madness. It's something bigger than that. Psychopath! You won't understand that. She was not able to get what she yearned for in her life. So she gets jealous and anxious when someone else gets it. Be it her daughter or granddaughter. She can't accept it. That fumes inside and she becomes devilish. An ass like you won't get it. Now she's behind Jasmine. Unaware of this, Jasmine and Sulfath still trust you both. Let it stay like that itself. Anyway, I got to know. Nobody else should get to know it. Go. For God's sake don't play along with her madness. Or else everyone would lose their peace of mind. This island would lose its peace and harmony. Go. Go home. Ask him to leave without making any problem. -Or else... -Or else Beevumma would command. And you'd obey. Yes. You're Beevumm's puppet. You're out of your mind. Come. Come here. Come. Kunjathu... Come here. He has gone crazy. Don't let him out tonight. -Hey... -Idhru! Don't get onto me. Sit down. Sit there. What happened? You don't need to know. Close the door. Hello...Where are you? I'll leave early in the morning. I want to meet you before I go. I want to see you. I'll be there outside your house. Will you come? Hello... Let him go. Move your leg. -Damu brother... -Yes? -Is dinner ready? -Yes. Oh, is it tuna curry on the last day also? You could have cooked biriyani at least today. Have it. I understood the value of Calicut now. -Aren't you leaving tomorrow? -Yes. Rab... There's a happy news. I'm also leaving along with you people. Transfer. It's punishment. Some higher officer double crossed. They're saying I'm hanging around here without registering any case. What can I say? Sir, what about your Guinness record? What can I do about it? But that's not what hurts me. I've got attached to this island and the people over here. Oh, leave it. Damodharan, I'll will be eating from here tonight. Why not! Sir, if you leave I'll get back to my old job automatically. Why? Don't you have a job at Arakkal? I've six daughters, sir. Wash your hands. Youngest is three years old. My house became a death house when she was born. What else will I do to look after all of them? From tomorrow this will also stop. Ajmal, what happened to your romance? It's like a decayed fish now. Don't worry, Ajmal. It's good to have a broken love at this age. You'd become mature. Ajmal, uncle is calling. What's your decision? Are you going tomorrow? Then what about Jasmine? Idiot, is this your love? Aren't you trying to become a superstar? Is this how heroes in movies behave? Go and bring her. What? Can't you do it? Don't you have the courage for it? Then why did you love her? Was it for fun? Then I'll be the one who's going to kill you. Not Idhru. Do you think you can leave easily after giving hope to a girl on this island? It won't happen. She likes you a lot. She'll be hurt if you leave her and go. Come. There'd be objections. Let them object. Go and call her in front of them itself. She'll come. Come on. Yassar, you go. We've some work. Leave the bike there. People say I'm crazy. This is also my craziness. God plays games like this. How else would he become God. This is Ajmal. I don't think he needs an introduction. He isn't a collector or a doctor. Just a boat carpenter. His family might not have status or class like Arakkal family. But more than me, you know very well that it doesn't matter in love. This isn't the time to advice or create a scene. Be practical. He has come to take Jasmine. Let her go. If this is God's plan, trying to alter it will cause all calculations to go wrong. No need of that. Let's send them happily. Jamsine, go and pack your bag. Bevumma will give her consent. Sulfath, ask him to leave. I'll go. After saying what I want to. Beevumma, stop there. Jasmine, change your dress and come. You'll be going with Beevumma's consent. Get out! Don't show your madness at Arakkal house. I want to give the reply to this only to the queen of Arakkal. Sulfath, take Jasmine and go inside. Go. You wait outside. Idhru would do whatever Arakkal Beevumma tells him, right? He has done in the past also, hasn't he? Idhru told me how Sulfath's husband fell into the sea and died. That story which only the two of you knew, if nobody else shouldn't get to know.... if Sulfath and Jasmine shouldn't get to know... this crazy Ansari should decide. So, Bevumma will obey Ansari. Jasmine will go with your consent. Let your madness get doused inside you itself. Don't take it outside. You go. I don't have any problems. Live happily wherever you are. God will take care of you. Tell Ajmal and enroll in some college. All these while... All that we forbide you from doing... Let you get it at least now. You want a smoke? Your Jasmine will always be your child. You should pray for me. Stay on the boat until your friends come in the morning. They'll be surprised to see Jasmine. Celebrate your love without any disturbance by watching moonlight and stars. Just forget Sulfath, Beevummaand this island for a while. Forget me also. Go. Hey... Be brave, my dear child. Ajmal, I'm sending her because I trust you. Not just her mother's, she is the darling of this entire island. Go. Climb. All the best. Enjoy your love. Hey, like he said, no sadness. Okay? Blue sky Love is boundless The fish which swim day and night are like dreams In the moonlit cold hands that extend The shore is getting fondled all alone Just like the waves washing ashore There're infinite desires inside me Blue sky Love is boundless The fish which swim day and night are like dreams Even the sound of the drop of a feather is heard here The blue sea shore becomes the heart rhythm of the white sea shell I hear your heartbeats,you hear my heartbeats Just like the waves washing ashore There're infinite desires inside me Blue sky Love is boundless The fish which swim day and night are like dreams Until the sun sets Until the moon vanishes Even if the deep sea dries out This love will not cease You represent me and I represent you Just like the waves washing ashore There're infinite desires inside me Blue sky Love is boundless The fish which swim day and night are like dreams Idhru... Idhru... Get up. Beevumma is calling you. Should I kill him? Yes. Ajmal... Idhru, no... Ajmal... Idhru, no... Ajmal... Idhru, stop it. Ajmal... Ajmal... Ajmal...
