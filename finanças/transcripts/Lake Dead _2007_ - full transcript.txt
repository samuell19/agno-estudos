Don't do this! We're family! No! I told you, I've made up my mind! John was right to leave when he did. Don't say that! I know you don't mean it! The tradition is sick! No! You're all sick! No! And it dies right here! Please, Willard. It's all our family has ever known. Gloria, open your eyes. What we've been doing is an abomination, and I'll have no part of it. Not anymore! May God forgive us. Son of a bitch! Out of my way, boy! Only one thing's gonna stop me, and you ain't got the balls to do it! Motherfucker! Ben, answer the phone. They'll leave a message. It's the middle of the night. It could be an emergency. Hello. John, why are you calling here? Fine. If she doesn't wanna take your call, I'm gonna hang up. Don't fucking call back, okay? Babe, it's your father. He says he really needs to talk to you. Want me to hang up? What do you want, John? What? My grandfather died before I was born. You're drunk. No way am I drunk! Stop screaming. Stop screaming at me. Brielle! Brielle! Hang up. Hello? What's going on, babe? Brielle. He said... He said I had a grandfather who died today. I thought both your grandparents were dead. Yeah. That's what I thought. I'm sorry, honey. I told you my family was... fucked up. Are you okay? You wanna talk about it? Well, if you change your mind, wake me up, okay? Okay. Hold on. Who is it? Brielle. Oh, shit. I don't have your money, okay? I'm still working on it. I'm not here for the money. Feel free to get dressed. Fuck you, Ben. Fuck you, Sam. Not now, Ben. What do you guys want? Can we come in? Oh, my God! It smells like vodka and onions in here. What the fuck do you guys want? Did Dad call you last night? Dad? Why the fuck would he call me? So he didn't? No. Wait. Somebody called last night, but it was really fucking late, so I didn't answer it. Did they leave a message? If I had a fucking answering machine, they probably would have. Can you say a sentence without using the word "fuck" in it? Fuck you. I guess not. The place looks really nice, Sam. Yeah? Feel free to clean up. See anything you like? Hell, no. Dad called me last night. Yeah? Forgive me for not giving a fuck. He said we had a grandfather who died yesterday. What? We don't have a grandfather. Yeah, I know. That's what he wanted us to think. Brielle, he's a fucking drunk. Can't believe anything he says. This time it's true. What do you mean it's true? A messenger shows up this morning at my place and hand delivers this to me. What is it? It's an invitation to visit the property our grandfather left us. Property? It says he left us a motel. Are you fucking kidding me? No. Where? It's about four hours north of here. No shit. So what do we do? First we go to the funeral this Thursday, and then we check the place out. We can make a weekend out of it, and you guys can decide what you wanna do with the motel. Are you kidding? We're gonna fucking sell it. Yeah. And the first $2,000 of your cut comes to us. Eat shit, Ben. So, you in? Fuck, yeah. But I'm not gonna be stuck with him. I'll drive up tomorrow... by myself. You're not gonna go to the funeral? I don't have any fucking desire to see our father. That's typical. Real classy, Sam. I mean, he was only your grandfather. Hey, what makes you so goddamn self-righteous, you fucking construction worker? At least I'm not a bartender slash drug dealer slash drug addict slash dumb-shit fuck monster... Ben! Who the fuck's here? Tell 'em to shut the fuck up. Picked another winner, huh, Sam? I need you guys to go. Uh, okay. Uh, here's a copy of the letter and... a map to the motel. See you there. Okay. Take care, sis. May you grant this, your servant, everlasting peace. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Why didn't you tell us? It's better this way. How can you say that? Brielle, I've never given you a lot of reasons to trust me. Believe me, trust me on this one. I don't think so. I think you wanted to deprive us of a grandfather, like you've deprived us of everything else! He was a bad man, and I'm glad he's dead, and you should be, too. Bad man? How can you say that? He's already given us more than you ever did! What do you mean? He left us some land up north. A motel. But I'm sure you already know about that. Look, do not go up there. You understand? Don't touch me! Forget the land. I'm sure that's what you want. Well, you know what? It's ours now. Ours. Brielle, I am begging you, do not go there, okay? You're pathetic. Kelli! What a dump. Bet you're worth something. What a fucking shit hole. It's occupied. It's occupied! Aah! Aah! You okay? What is it? I don't know. ♪♪ Hey, B. Guess again. What's up, Benny boy? You ready to rough it for the weekend? Hell, yeah. Well, get over here. I'm almost ready.

Oh, sure thing, honey. Here. Use one of the rooms. They're a lot nicer than what I got back there. Okay. Oh, sorry, honey. I didn't mean to scare you. That's okay. You know, I forgot. The plumbing's bad in this room. Let's go find you another room, okay? Okay. Come on. I know we can find one. All right. Mmm, okay, yeah. Hey! Hey, what's the story? Well, we just met the lady who runs the motel, and she said that there are some great places to go camping. And that there's a lake, too. A lake? Awesome! What about Sam? She says she hasn't seen her. That's weird. Is it? I mean, it's Sam. Yeah. She could be anywhere, huh? Hey, guys.Hey. Did you guys find Sam? Yeah, she's at the clinic refilling her meds. Ben!

Are you all right? Yeah. Fuck. Good job! Eyes closed and all. Now, where were we? I think Tanya likes you. Really? Yeah. Do you like her? Why would she like me? Why wouldn't she like you? How long we been together? How many times have you cheated on me? Ooh-hoo-hoo! You're gonna... You're gonna bring that up again, huh? Look, I love you, okay? And nothing's gonna happen. You better not fuck with me again. Come here. So you think we should sell it? Yeah. But think about Sam. I know. I know. She's in so much debt. I'm gonna get some wood.

Relax. Amy, are you okay? Is it just me? So when are you and Amy getting married? I don't know. I haven't given it much thought, you know? Do you think she'd be mad if she knew how hot I thought you were? Excuse me? What, you don't like me? No, no, no, it's not that. It's just... Amy and I are, like, you know, really working on things. It's just that... I saw the way you were looking at me. I'm not stupid, Bill. Let's see if you have the wood to light my fire. I've wanted this since I first saw you. Me, too. Look, you can't tell anyone about this, okay? Not even Kelli. Nobody. You understand me? Cross my heart, hope to die, okay? How fucking long does it take to get firewood? Amy, I'm sure there's a reason they've been gone so long. Yep, I'm sure there is. Ben! Don't be a jerk! I was joking. Amy, you're just being paranoid. Are you guys mad at Tanya? Why would we ever be mad at Tanya? Aw, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. I wish we could do that all night. Okay. Uh, okay. Please tell me you're not the guilty type. Bill, if you don't relax, they're gonna know something's up. Look, that was pretty fucking fantastic, okay? I'm sorry about that back there, you know? It's not a big deal. It's just sex. Yeah. Let's get back to the campfire. They're gonna start to wonder. Okay. Come on. Aah! No, don't! Ah, God! Aah! Leave her alone! Stop it! Stop it! Aah! Aah! This is bullshit. How could you bring that little slut with you? Hey, fuck you, Amy! You don't even know her! Hey, relax. What if they're lost? I'll go look for them. I'm going with you. You guys stay here in case they come back. What's the deal with your friend? What do you mean? Oh, come on. She's flaunting her shit all over the place.

Just doing my job. Aah! No! Help! Excuse me, sir? What can I do for you, sweetheart? Shouldn't we radio someone for help? I'm pretty much a one-man show around here. Something like this, gotta bring in the state police. To do that, I need a landline. Hotel's up the way here. I'll make a call from there. Shouldn't we be heading towards the station? Small-town jail. Believe me, son, hotel's a lot nicer place to be. Excuse me for being so forward, but you two got the prettiest blue eyes I've ever seen. What's your names? Come on.

So, Mr. Ben, what the hell happened out there? Fuck! Kelli, you need to relax, okay? The police are here now. Relax? You didn't see Bill hanging from a fucking tree! This is so bad!

Oh, yes, I did. See... after your brother John abandoned us... May he rot in hell for that... He had two daughters, Brielle and Kelli. Oh, their blood's not pure like yours is, but it's all we got left. They must become part of our family. Understand? Now listen carefully.

Yes. Kill her! Kill, Ben! He's taken her to the barn. Come on. Stay here. No, I'm coming with you. All right, fine. Let's go. I'll tell you what, this mess has got your daddy written all over it. My brother, he was a man of limited talent, less insight, and absolutely no sense of family tradition. Hey! Come on. I'm trying to tell you about your family here. Fuck you! We're not family! Don't be like that. I'm trying to... You bring out the worst in me, I'll tell you that much. He went this way! Yes. Come on. Kelli! Brielle! Are you in here? Look at him. Look at him! You owe me, Brielle. Look at that. His name was Abel. His brother was Cain, and they was my boys. They was good boys. They can fish, they can hunt. But, Brielle, me and you... Yeah, Brielle, me and you... We're gonna rebuild the Lake family. That's what we're gonna do, Brielle. We're gonna rebuild. Ben! Kelli, run. Kelli, run! No! Come on! Come on, Ben! Come on! Where you going, girl, huh? What do you want from me? Just carry on the family name. It doesn't have to be this hard! Hang in there, Ben. I guess he should've knocked first, huh? This could've been so easy. So... Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Fuck! Aah! Please don't! No! Get the fuck off of my little girl! Wait your fucking turn, Johnny! Go outside, honey. Close the door. This is the last time, Chuck. Fuck you! This tradition's over. You don't have the balls. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay? Uh-huh. Ben? That's how you fuck family. God! I am so sorry you had to come here. Let's get him to a hospital. Okay. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on. Come on. This place is fucking awesome! Whoa! Do you think it's abandoned? There's only one way to find out. This place is kind of creepy. Yeah. Guys, I don't think this is a good idea. What if... What if there's someone here? We don't know that. We can get in trouble. Ah-choo! Aah! Fuck you! Wait.
