Where exactly in the contract does it say that I only get to sleep with you once in a blue moon? Sub-clause one, for better or for worse. Did I leave any T-shirts here? You'd think I'd know to read the small print. I said where are they? Ow! Oh, go away! Try again when you've had a shave. Nah. Doesn't it go the image. Yeah, black T is in the drawer. Hope that's not too clean for your image. Oh, come on, don't. Look, another few days, max, eh? Then all I'm going to be doing is paperwork, the bike, and taking care of your every need. Mm, where have I heard that before? [exhales] I'm going to be so glad when all this is over. [WHISPERS] Yeah, same here. Yeah, right. What? [giggles] [kisses aggressively] - Mm! Arr! [laughter] [music playing] Oh, Briggs. Give me a heartache, why don't you? I bought a bottle of champagne, even ordered entrees. - Oh no! I'm so sorry. I forgot all about it. I waited over an hour. And meanwhile, I was at home having a quiet panic attack. I've got my end of use day, OK? Sorry. - How much, then? - What? My share of the dinner I never had, how much? [scoffs] Forget it. No, no, no. Obviously means so much. - No, really. Look, I'm sorry, OK? Um, I'm getting back to the lab. They're waiting on some results. But good luck today. Thanks. Maybe tonight, a celebration? I'll call you. [music playing] [inaudible]. Well, well. Look who it is. What's up, man? Not much, not much. How you been? - [inaudible], mate. Actually, listen. I was meaning to catch up with you. You hear there's a bloke down the pub? [sketchy recording] You get down there. He's probably still there, man. TV, eh? So he said. All right, that's me. See you later. - [inaudible]. Hang on. That's better. JOHN LAWLESS: OK, girls. Hands off cocks. That's my boy. [grunts] There ya go. Let's tear it down. Yeah, [inaudible]. Cheers. [grunting] [groaning] [loud groans] TERRY: [SHOUTING] Think about this next time you think it would be smart to rip me off, dickhead. Be with you in a moment. [pounding drum] Bruford, 10-7. [rock music playing faintly] Johnny Wilson. How's it going? I want a word with you. Here I am. [eerie music playing] [johnny grunting] [kissing] [terry laughing] Shit. [smack] I love you like a brother, man. You mad prick, Bowers. You really are the pizza delivery man, aren't you? What do I owe you for your [inaudible].. Percentage. TERRY: How many caps you going to get out of this lot? Charlie 10-7. [radio static] Alpha 10-7. [radio static] Come here. JOHN LAWLESS: What is it? Walk with me. Out the back. We've lost him. The mic's crapped out or disconnected. Bloody hell. So, Mr. Pizza Man. Shooters, you going to get them? What do you want guns for? Hear about a job that went down in Perth about a month ago? Armored van, it was all over the papers. They got nearly half a mil. What, are they coming over here or something? If we set up right. These mates of yours, they're not Aussies, are they? Well, don't hold that against them, eh. This is DC [inaudible] Snow. Move in now, and keep an eye out for our man Lawless. [siren blaring] [music playing] [panicked yelling] Shit. Go! Go! [inaudible] Terry Bowers. Come on. Stay here, stay here. Let him go. JOHN LAWLESS: What was I supposed to do, slap you with a limp wrist? Yeah, well, a limp wrist sounds pretty good actually. Next time go for the guts, all right? The bruises don't show. There's not going to be a next time. It's about time we got serious about going private, Dave-o Look for some office spaces. Yeah, yeah. Let's do the paperwork on this, all right? Then we can talk. Yeah, I can't put it over on you. Haven't got all day. Thank you, Bruford. What happened in there? Why'd you let him go? I didn't have any choice, did I? Not once he started talking about the guns. Guns. I'm sorry, John. The gear let us down. We heard none of this. [sighs] Yes, I know what it says in the book. I know the book all by heart. I was just making the point that a gang of skinheads burning down the local mosque's not quite the same as a bunch of old age pensioners getting upset about a hospital being closed down. Please don't do this to me. I'd make a good cop. I know I would. Then just ask me the questions again because I know what you want to hear. I'm sorry. It's because I'm short, isn't it? No. Blonde then. I know what it is. Scratch the surface and the new police force is as sexist as the old. Some people just aren't psychologically suited to the position no matter how much they want it. In your case, Miss Keane, it's your attitude to authority. OK, fine. I'll go back to being office chick and you go back to hiring morons who can't think for themselves. ALAN SNOW: Six weeks ago in Perth, an armored van was hit. Four men, a very smooth job. They got away with $485,000. You're in the wrong business. We'll get what information we can on it. In the meantime, make contact with Bowers as soon as you can. He wants guns. Promise anything you like. What we'll give him is eight to 10. [music playing] I know how tough it is out there. If you want to pull the plug now, I'll understand. No one's going to hold it against you, John. Better get someone down there to arrest me then, eh? Come around on Sunday for your debrief, and a decent feed. Eileen's worried you're not looking after yourself. Yeah. Be good, boss. [door closes] [music playing] - Johnny, turn over, darling. - You know, Rosalie. How's it hanging? - Hey. You shouldn't be asking me that. So tell me, you don't happen to know where I can score a bit of speed, do you? I'm that buggered. Pardon my French. My man's let me down. Might just be able to help you out with a gram there, Rosalie. Love you forever. Is that a threat? Take it any way you like. I know I do. Listen, love. You couldn't tell me where to find Terry Bowers, could you? Informant places Terry Bowers in Australia, so I suggest a customs check if you haven't already, you lazy pricks. Uh, could be a connection with those Aussie Tuaregs. Maybe he's working on his tan. Who knows? Listen, babe. I'm sorry. Look, something went wrong. These things happen, eh? Every damn time, John. You promised. Yeah, I know and I'll make it up to you. Look, I don't even have time to stop and talk about this. Now I'm due in court in five minutes. Fly down tonight and we'll talk about it. No, I can't come down there. Look, I just can't, all right? I would if I could. [knock on door] WILLY KAA: Open the door. This is a raid. Look, someone's at the door. Yeah right. Bugger. Marla? WILLY KAA: Come on, man. Saw your wheels out the front. We heard you got busted today. You OK? Yeah. Yeah, just as well I pissed off when I did. You're going down, bro. You're going down for sure. - Oh, Paul. Leave Johnny alone. He doesn't need to hear that. Eh, don't worry. Dr. Willy's got just the thing for you. [inaudible] eh? [inhales deeply] Oh, I never did find that bloke you said was asking about the TV. I'm not complaining, but-- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that, bro. Had us a long kind of [inaudible] day. I was hoping to hit the sack early. Just as well we came around and saved you from going blind. True. Sonya's been worried about the time you're spending sleeping on your own. Willy! Just 'cause you're not getting any. Here, bro. Get that into you. It'll brighten up your day. You are bad people. [laughing] [birds chirping] [groaning] Sonya. Killer weed, eh? Uh, Willy helped carry you in but I, um, did the rest. Don't worry. I'm a nurse. I've seen it all before. JOHN LAWLESS: Yeah. Though most of the men I see aren't nearly as pretty. Mm. Um. I'm pretty buggered. I've got to get an early start. Jesus. You know, if you don't like me, just say so. Don't bullshit me. No, I like you. Of course I do. It's just, things are complicated. You're gay? No. I'm married. So where is she? Down South Island. Well, that's very sweet, but she's not here and I am. I'm sorry. [music playing] I should've jumped you while I had the chance. Anyway, I've got an early start. Want to just, you know, talk? Are you working? A couple of lines will keep me going. Then I'll go home and flake tonight. Don't know how you do it, girl. [chuckles] You try looking after sick people all day when you're straight. [cutting lines] WILLY KAA: Probably flooded it, cuz. Nah, man. Check when it's flooded. No choke. Put the accelerator flat to the floor. [engine revving] Think you're smart, don't you? Not for me to say. I'm going to take a dozen long-necks and get a [inaudible] mullet. Interested? Ah, another day. Got to earn a living. Now listen, eh? If you catch up with Terry Bowers on your trails, will you tell him I want a word? What do you want with that mad whore? Seen him bottle of bloke down [inaudible] once. Poor bastard bumped into him by accident. Bowers nearly took his face off. Now you're scaring me, bro. Could you just tell him? Later. [music playing] Ah, [inaudible]. Ah, no, no. You can. I'm going to go home. Idea. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sandringham please. Hi. Settle. You're the best, Jodie. No, just the closest. Hands off. Ow! [sighs] Drop him off at GT, will you? Where to, mate? Nah, bugger it. Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, come on. - Come on. - You know you want it. - Let go. Let go of me! [struggling and screaming] Get going. Come on! Piss off! Now be going or you'll end up with you nuts in your mouth, all right? You all right? Yeah, thanks. You live here by yourself, do you? Just me and the cat. I don't think he's going to come back, but it might pay to keep the door locked, eh? Yeah, I will. You want a drink or something? I could kill a gin. No. No, I better get back to it, eh? Well I'm Jodie by the way. Johnny. You're a cop, aren't you? Undercover or something. Piss off. Down at the station with Dave Bruford. You remember that? Are you a cop? Just the office chick. If you think your cover's blown, it's cool. I'm not going to tell anyone. I'm a cab driver, OK? OK? You're a cab driver. Thanks. [music playing] Freeze! [laughing] Get that lock fixed, Johnny. Stuffed. Yeah, you mean it is now. What are you doing wandering around after slugging that cop? Well I got bailed, didn't I? Yeah? Lucky. You know the dickhead never identified himself. I'll tell him I was just there to catch a lift. These two clowns come over the back fence. I had no idea they were cops. You know that job I was talking about? I've got it all lined up. It's going to blow you away. Apparently these are the same people who are responsible for a spate of armed holdups in Australia over the last 13 months. Bowers left at about 3 AM. [knock on door] WILLY KAA: Open up in the name of the law. Piss off, Willy! WILLY KAA: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may and will be used against you as evidence in a court of law. Just let me put some clothes on, eh? What's up, man? Thought you could hide it from us, eh? Look, either start making sense or piss off, eh? Your birthday, bro. Hey, happy birthday, bro. Why didn't you tell us? Happy birthday. Sonya's seen it on your passport or something. Can't help it. I'm just nosey. - Yeah. - Ta-da! Come on. You guys freaked me out. [GUITAR PLAYING AND DRUNKEN SINGING] It's delicious. You really baked this? What? Might burn a few snags later, eh? Oh, man. I can't, eh. I've got to go see my auntie. This whole Sunday roast birthday thing. That's cool. Have a fun day. [laughing] What? What? No, no. You're going to have a choice time with the auntie. The cake is chock full of hash. That's your birthday present. Happy birthday, brother. [dog barking] John. Lovely to see you. Come on in. Stay! Good day. EILEEN SNOW: I hope you're hungry. JOHN LAWLESS: I reckon. Hello, John. Glad you could make it. Something to drink? Briefing session, Sunday, 18th of March, 14:48 hours. Present are Detective Senior Sergeant Alan Snow and Detective Constable John Lawless. In body at least. I'm sorry. Some friends of mine gave me a cake. Friends? Associates. They gave me a hash cake for my birthday. Only it's not my birthday, is it? It's Johnny Wilson's, so-- Pieces apparently. Take a few deep breaths, son. We'll get through this as quickly as we can then you can sleep it off in the spare room. Eileen, can we have some more coffee in here please? He's definitely setting up for an armored van. No names or anything, just went on about the Perth job. It was armored van. Shit, I said that. Um. It's all right, John. You're doing fine. What does Bowers want from you? Couple of semi-automatics, pump action shotgun. Tell him you'll set it up. I'll sort it, OK? We can worry about the details later. Boss? I need to go home, explain that it's going to take longer than we thought. I don't think that would be wise. No, I-- I need to. And there's something else as well. There are some people who offer a [inaudible] for information. Now I do not want them charged. You know I can't do that. Jesus, Alan. They're nobodies! There's no promotion in busting them, nothing to be gained by putting them inside. Off the record, I'll do what I can. I'd appreciate that. [music playing] I shouldn't have hung up on you. I'm sorry. But I just thought, here we go again. Yeah. Me too. I'm so glad this is finally over. Babe? Mm. I quite like it when you call me babe. Anyone else, I'd deck him. I've only got two days. You bastard. You've-- - Babe, I'm sorry. - No. Don't talk to me. Just go away. [music playing] Oi! Turn it down! I miss your crap taste in music. Well, a few clear weeks, I'll be back in the water. Oh yeah. I believe that. Oh ye of little faith. We were going to spend the summer on the water, sailing around the Marlborough Sounds. Was that three years ago or four? As soon as this job's over, I'm going to Perth. No, it's different. I'm going to get out. You and Dave and your pie-in-the-sky detective agency. - No, no. This is going to happen. Yeah, and we're going to spend the summer sailing. Damn, you are so used to living a lie, you don't even know when you're doing it to yourself or me. Marla, just don't piss off in a stink. Talk to me, will you? No, you talk to me. OK. It's not working, is it? I'm not saying it's your fault, not all of it. Do you think we should call it a day? I don't know. Is that what you want? I asked you first. This job of mine, it's big, you know? It's probably the most dangerous thing I've ever done, but I've really got to see it through. If I don't, this last 18 months have been for nothing. I might as well have been polishing a seat with my ass. Do you think I want to hear that? Babe, I'm just telling you how it is. Do you think I want to know how dangerous it is when there's not a damn thing I can do about it? I'd rather not know anything. I'd rather you got right out of my life than have to spend every minute afraid of what they might be doing to you out there. Damn, John. [scoffs] WILLY KAA: Hey, there he is. Grab a cue, bro. Hey, you and me play Willy and Paul? Yeah. [music playing] Are you mad at me or something? You know, because if you are-- - No. It's got nothing to do with you. Two bucks a ticket. Come on, mate. It's for a good cause. You know Mattie. WILLY KAA: Yeah. Get us a couple, bro. Old man got done in their raid the other day. She needs a bit of help for the kids and that. Yeah. No worries. Give us a book, mate. Big frigging spender. What was that, Bill? I said you're an asshole. What are you going to do about it? Let's go, bro. Shit head! Hey, don't I know you? John! John! Come on, mate. Come on. John, it's some kind of an asshole. Come on. It's OK. I'm done. Just let go! Piece of shit. [breathing heavily] Are you going to draw that or what? I won the meat pack. Good on you. Oh, good day, Joe. Sorry. Hi, John. Look, we'll go out the back, eh? Beauty. Fire up the barbie, boy. [meat sizzling] Don't you go [inaudible] on me, mate. You know I want it, mate. You know I do. Yeah, and? It's just I talked it over with Joe. Look, she went off at me, eh. She reckons going private's too risky. Not if you're smart. It's a growth industry. Yeah, but while it's growing, who's paying the mortgage? I'm just saying I can see it from her point of view, you know? Three kids and what a decent education costs these days. Man, we've talked it over, every detail. Look, I was just daydreaming out loud. Filling in time on the jobs. Come on, mate. Everyone does it. Just-- just finish this up, eh, and then get back on the job. Look, it's late. You better get to bed, man. [music playing] I was worried about you. Dropping that guy, taking off like that. I just went to a friend's place. Uh-huh? Anyone I know? Well, after you went, you know the other guys were saying, um-- What? What'd they say? Just stuff, you know? Nothing bad. Wondering where you come from and where you disappear to all the time. Willy asked about you and me, and I told him about your wife. What'd he say? He said it wasn't natural. Or-- or you're just making that up. And why would i do that? Well maybe you're on the run from somewhere or someone, or you don't want us to know who you really are. [kissing] [music playing] Why did you do that? Because you're beautiful. Look, it's no big mystery where I've been. I went down south to see my wife, my ex-wife. I guess I finally realized it's over, so I'd know if-- if you want to-- Hey. You need to rebound? Rebound on me. [kissing] [music playing] What are you doing? [chuckles] Getting ready for work. What's it look like? You shouldn't have to do that shit. Keeps me thin. Hey, before I go, this was kind of a birthday present I didn't have the guts to give you before. Not more cake, is it? I wondered, do you want to come to the Gold Coast with me? Five days. I've got a girlfriend who'll take it if you don't, but well, we could get to know each other, have sex, get a tan, whatever. I was going to ask you about it before but then you said about being married, but now it's different, right? I mean, it's OK if you don't want to, but will you think about it? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Woo-hoo! Hey look, I've got to fly. I left you a line. See ya. [door closes] [guitar playing] Sonya! Sonya! You can call me Sonya. I don't mind. Jesus, Bowers. Do you ever bloody knock? Where are the shooters? They're organized. Show me. Well I'm not thick, am I? They're not here. You get the guns, call me on my mobile. Yeah. The thing with that is, the people who've organized them, they're out of town. I know something came up, but I'm going to need like a day, maybe two. So what, the Aussies here already, are they? Just call me. If I tell Bowers I've got the guns and I turn up empty handed, he could do me. I mean, the bloke is unbalanced. Deliver the guns. That'll get you in. Been a stack of confiscated hardware from that raid we did on the gang headquarters down near Rotorua, enough to keep Bowers happy. We'll cover you every step of the way. AOS, the reds, Eagle One. We'll stick to you like shit to a blanket. The minute they make contact, you call me. That's all it's going to take, one call. You had this planned all along. I want you with me 100% because we're a team. It's important. So if you can think of another way, tell me. You're the boss. Thanks, John. It is the only way. [music playing] You got something there for us? I thought you were supposed to wait for me to call you. Yeah, well, my mates thought this way would be better. Well, let's see. [unzips bag] So are you going to introduce us or what? Sure. Guys, this is Johnny Wilson. These are my Australian cousins. Shut up, Bowers. I haven't got any ammo for those, man. We'll take care of it. [cocking gun] Sweet. Let's go. Eh? You heard him. Stop playing with yourself. Let's move. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do yet, mate. Boot camp. He's going to take us through the drill. You told us he was cool. You'll learn everything you need to know starting now. Empty your pockets. No phones, no IDs. I've just got a girlfriend to call first, eh? She's at work. - Hey! I'm only going to say this once. 'Til this job's over, you're with us. You don't talk to anyone. You don't even fart without checking first, got it? [laughing] That's good It's the way it is. [music playing] What's up? A testing station. Filth back home break off the firing pins. They do that here? Wouldn't know, mate. Well, I'd feel a right moron if we get into a bit of strife, I pull the trigger, nothing happens. There you go. [music playing] [gunshot] Woo! Beauty. [gunshot] [gunshot] They're still asleep, are they? Where you off to? - I don't know. I feel like a beer. Thought I'd pop down the boozer. What do you reckon? I need a slash. Be my guest. Would you like a heart starter? Not for me, thanks. Wouldn't let those Aussies catch you. Those pricks don't scare me, eh. Come on. Get your ass into gear. Action time, Johnny. Ha ha. Let's do it! [clapping hands] [music playing] It's party time, Johnny. Woo! Keep it down, will you? I can't hear myself think. What are those bloody idiots up to? [horn honking] [tires squealing] Shit! Woo! We got you. Suck on this! OK, let's do it. Get out of the vehicle! Open the door! Get out! Get off that radio! Repeat, armed robbery in progress. [gunshot] - Come on. I'm not joking. Out of the vehicle! [all yelling] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Just stay there. Stay there! I don't want to see your faces! Get the rest. Get the rest. Come on. Come on. Come on, piss off! No! [gunshot] [groaning] Oh, Christ. I had no choice. He was getting away! - Get back in the car. - We can't just leave him here. The car, now! Come on. - Get back in the bloody car! - We're clear! Let's go! What's he doing? You want to leave your prints in here for the cops? Don't you pricks know anything? Go! [car exploding] How stupid do you have to be to do that, John? What did he think he could do, just outrun a bullet? You've done enough today. Sit there and shut up. Reckon the airport's out? - Yeah. We're going to have to lie low. Shit. He was getting away. Signal on the left. We're going to have half the cops in the country up our ass. Thanks for the advice. Now shut up and drive. POLICE STATION EMPLOYEE: OK, thanks. Sir, you might want to look at this. - Shit a brick! - What's up? Fives? Tens? Does this look like half a million to you? Does it? [first responders talking] [music playing] Hey, I'm going to kill that bastard, eh. He swore to me there'd be like $600,000 here. Shut your face. $123,000. Divided by 3. REPORTER: [ON TV] The injured guard, Graham [inaudible] is in intensive care, where it's understood his condition is critical. His wife Miriam said he'd expressed concerns about the safety conditions of his job. They said this was urgent. Oh, thank you. Oh, that poor woman. MIRIAM: [ON TV] On at the company to get new bulletproof vests. And it was like, this kind of thing doesn't happen here. These people can get guns just like anyone else. REPORTER: In a related story, a man has been taken in-- [music playing] 40 grand. Should've been more but it's better than a kick in the ass. What did he say? What are you two whispering about, eh? Sh! I'll bloody cut you out of your share so far. Keep your head down. You get pulled in, remember, they can't prove nothing so keep your mouth shut. You guys are going to need somewhere to hide out until things cool down. I can help you with that. Nah. You did OK, mate. [knock on door] Alan, John's here. He said you're expecting him? Thanks, love. They shot the poor bastard in the back for Christ's sake. ALAN SNOW: If you blow your cover now, it's all been for nothing. Is that what you want? What I want is that you never talked me into this in the first place. We did what we thought was best. Yeah, were we wrong. OK, what we do. We go down to the station and we just explain everything. We tell them that we supplied guns to criminals, that's it. Our careers are over at the very least. And if they decide to make an example of us, we could do time. Don't fall apart on me now, John. We've been through too much together. We stepped over the line. All right, but give me until the morning at least. I won't feel any different. Then we'll go in together, tell them the whole story. But we've got to to back each other up, take the best angle. Well what do I do with this? This is $40,000. That's a bloody impressive hourly rate. Hang onto it for now. Wouldn't it be better here? Not a good idea, complicating things at this stage. Go home. Try and get some sleep. I'll try and chart the best course for both of us. I had to leave him there. He was bleeding on the ground like that, and he was hurting so bad and there was nothing I could do. That's right. There was nothing you could do. It wasn't your fault, John. Yeah. [music playing] Inspector Ellis, please. Susan? Alan. Look, I've just had an informant ring in with some disturbing information. [cat meowing] Zena. Zena, get out of the rubbish. That's the thing about cats. They make lousy guard dogs. Take off at the first sign of trouble. What are you doing here? I need a favor. From me. Look, if you don't want to help, just say so. I haven't got time to stuff around. Why me? As far as I know, no one knows there's a connection between us. I mean, every other bloody detail of my life is on tape of file somewhere. Fair enough. I have no right to lay this on you. Do us one favor though. Just don't tell anyone I was here. What do you want? [music playing] Hello, John. Johnny! [sobbing] They found dope and speed. I'll lose my job, Johnny, everything. Ray, over here. Do a swab on his hands. What? What does she mean? What she means is they want to know if I fired a gun recently. That right, Susan? Gun? What's she talking about? What's happened? It's all right. I'm just doing my job. So was I. There were some white crystals, 50 grams which we can assume were amphetamines. 200 grams of marijuana, some unidentified tablets. Could be ecstasy, we'll wait for the lab report. What about the money? No sign of it. There must be. As I said, I've got a very reliable informant. SUSAN ELLIS: Where were you yesterday afternoon? I want to talk to Snow. Just a few questions first, John. You know how it goes. Not anymore I don't. Where were you yesterday afternoon? Can't remember. Where were you? At about 2:30 PM, there was an armed holdup of an armored vehicle. In the course of the robbery, a guard was shot in the back at point blank range and I bloody well want to know if you were there. Is he all right? Still critical. Have you fired a gun recently? Was that a no? Tell me about Terry Bowers. How well do you know him? Your girlfriend saw you driving away in a car with him and two other men yesterday afternoon. Snow's my operator. It has to be him. Anything you want to say to DSS, Snow, you can say to me. I don't think that's true, boss. Is it on? If he has gone over to the other team, I want to nail him quickly, get it over with. But something about this whole business-- Perhaps I should talk to him. As his operator, you shouldn't be involved. Give us a minute off the record. He might open up, save us all a lot of trouble. OK. First, now might be a good time to tell me why you put the Armed Offenders on standby. A rumor, nothing more, that something like this might be going down. If only they'd been more specific. I'm sorry to have to put you through this, John. Did you set this up so I don't blow my cover? No. So what, don't you want me undercover anymore? I never want to see you again. Keep your mouth shut and I'll see to it you get released. Then it's up to you. What about the briefing tapes? What tapes? You haven't shown for weeks. That's a lie. Pardon me. You came once. You were so stoned, you couldn't string a sentence together. My wife, fond as she is of you, was very concerned. Oh, Jesus. You're going to do this, aren't you? I was concerned about your state of mind. It's in my notes. How you asked me to turn a blind eye to your friends. How I suspected you were using. Your sexual relationship with a drug user, obvious. She tried to take the blame for all the junk we found. You just leave Sonya out of this. She's done nothing. If you think that, John, you really have changed sides. But it's a big step from screwing a junkie to planning an armed robbery. Thanks. I get the picture. Take the money, wherever it is, and get far away. That's the best advice anyone's going to give you. What money? REPORTER: [ON TV] A guard is still in a critical condition after the robbery of an armored vehicle just north of the Bombay Hills yesterday afternoon. Four armed men took part in the attack and escaped with over $120,000. Police were on the scene in minutes with the Eagle One helicopter making a thorough search of the area, but by then, the four men had disappeared. SUSAN ELLIS: Why didn't you tell your operator you were planning a trip to Australia? He wasn't invited. John, have you been using? SUSAN ELLIS: All the junk we found at your flat. Well you try working undercover without it. You've been under a long time, 18 months, a big strain on anyone. Too big, feels like everyone's against you. I want my rep, and I want my lawyer. SUSAN ELLIS: Why don't you have a chat with our counselor first? Why don't I get the hell out of here? You've got nothing on me. John Lawless, I am charging you with the possession of Class A restricted drugs. [music playing] Not much fun, is it? Don't worry. A bit of paperwork to tidy up. You'll be out soon. Where's Johnny? Johnny? Johnny Wilson? Oh, you mean John. Detective Constable John Lawless. [music playing] MARLA LAWLESS: They came when mom and dad were visiting. - Jesus, Marla. - Don't touch me. Don't. First I heard about it, Dave rang. He was really worried, wouldn't say much. Then Alan was kind enough to ring and explain everything. Do you want to hear my side of it? Is this what you meant when you said you were involved in something dangerous or were you talking about your girlfriend? I have a life of my own, a career. I don't need this. I'm a lawyer married to a bent cop. So you think I'm a crook? I wouldn't have a bloody clue. That's the point, isn't it? Eight years of marriage and I don't know you. If there's anything you want, take it now. I don't want to see you again. [music playing] Piss off back to your other life. You've always preferred it anyway. [music playing] Oi, I want to talk to you. Go away. JODIE KEANE: Isn't there something you forgot to tell me? - Not now, OK? Because I was just, you know, wondering what I'm supposed to do with this. For Christ's sakes. It's from that robbery, isn't it? Where that guard got shot. You didn't tell me that. Well I didn't want you to get involved. I'm involved, OK? This is involved. Now get in. So please, tell me why I shouldn't drive you and that money around the corner straight to the station. It's kind of a long story. Oh, well I've got a full tank of gas, so start at the beginning and proceed to the end. Don't worry. No one's following us. If they were, you wouldn't know. Listen, you don't have to get involved if you don't want to. I can take the money. Ah, well that wouldn't be very smart, would it? Take care. Yeah. [music playing] [dialing phone] [phone ringing] VOICE MESSAGE GREETING: [ON PHONE] I'm sorry, we're not able-- Shit! [music playing] Sonya! Where's Sonya? I'm not pissing around. Where is she? In her room maybe. No. What did you do? [performing mouth-to-mouth] Someone help me in here! Someone help me! Come on, [inaudible]. [knock on door] Just a minute! Who is it? ALAN SNOW: Jodie Keane? Detective Senior Sergeant Snow. Don't tell me they've reconsidered my application. Sorry. Perhaps it's the company you keep. He's popular with the ladies, I'll give him that. Who? Don't piss me around, girly. John Lawless is a dangerous and desperate man. You'd do well to keep clear of him. He speaks so highly of you too. A word of advice, undercover cops learn to get on with everyone. They're everybody's friend. They'll use you, then they'll dump you. It's the nature of the game. Just ask his wife or his girlfriend. He tell you about them? Have you got a search warrant? Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, I don't need one. Well, I wouldn't go in there if I were you. My gym gear, it's pretty rank in there. I could have a team in here in 15 minutes and rip this place apart. Go ahead. I don't know what lies he's told you, but he organized that job. He stole a lot of money. And if you're not careful, he'll drag you down with him. Thanks for the advice. I appreciate it, really. Listen, Paul, man. I'll kill you! [scuffling] [crying] That bastard killed my sister! I found her in her room. I tried, man, but it was too late. She would have been pretty freaked about losing her job. She loved being a nurse, eh. Sonya loved helping people. Yeah. But I don't reckon that's why she done it. It'd be 'cause she found out the fellow she was with was a freaking narc! You go be with your family. They need you now. I'll take care of him. Go on. I should kick your head in. You'd be doing me a favor. Don't tempt me. It doesn't make sense, you know? We moved a lot of dope together, did some iffy jobs. You must have told them about that. So how come I'm still walking free? Maybe it slipped my mind? Or maybe you had bigger fish to fry. You were in on that job yesterday, eh? You and Bowers, where that guard got shot. Yeah. And now they're trying to set me up for it. And just to make sure that I skip the country, they are charging me with possession Class A. Well who's setting you up? The cops? Yeah. [chuckles] Should be more careful about the company you keep. Too true, mate. God, I can't work you out, man. Yeah well, that's pretty much the point, Will. You're not meant to work me out. You know, I tried to keep you out of it. You and Paul-- you and Paul and Sonya. You know, and if she hadn't gone around there that day, things would have been cool. And that's the other thing, because she was the best, you know? Had unlimited care. If anything happened to her, because she's on the other side. I screwed up, man. I just screwed up so bad. [music playing] Whatever you are, I know you cared for Sonya, so you go ahead and grieve for her. Then we'll work out whether I'm going to have to break your head. [chuckles sadly] [music playing] [siren blaring] [tires squealing] Shit, Dave! Leave that heap of junk there. Get in. The guard died about an hour ago. Ellis wants us to bring you in. Yeah. [closes car door] Lab on your hands came back positive for gunshot residue. They found hairs that match the guard's on your clothes. So you were there? Yeah. [sighs] Snow organized the guns we used. We were supposed to have the AOS backing us up, but Bowers shanghaied me before I could make the call. Can you prove this? No. Snow's flushed it. Falsed our entries, the lot. He's been like a terrier with a wasp up his ass, dragging in every man and his dog. He wants Bowers bad. And what if he only wanted him in as fair a way as possible? It's just a pity that guard got it with a shotgun. Yeah. Well, I'm sure his misses feels the same way, mate. I mean if it was a rifle, we could trace the bullet back to the armory. You know, prove the gun was in police possession. Oh bloody hell. Either you're a genius or I'm a bloody idiot. Genius sounds OK. What'd I say? Where Snow wants Bowers. Hang on. Where you going? What, you're going to arrest me? Of course I'm bloody well not. Joe's parents, they've got a beach house just along the road from here. You can hang out there until, well, we get something sorted. Not going to get you in trouble with the misses, is it? It was her idea. Fancy a wee drive first? [music playing] [waves crashing] Snow came to see me at my place. It's OK. The money's all right. [breathing heavily] It's kind of good in a way because if I wasn't sure about you before, I am now. He's got such a bad aura. Aura, yeah. Ah, so that's how you look when you smile. It's quite nice really. Uh, he um-- he said some pretty bad stuff about you. He talked about you having a wife and a girlfriend. Not anymore. Listen, you don't have to do this, you know. I mean, we're talking about murder now. This is a whole different ballgame, so the best thing you can do right now is just walk away. Yeah, like you walked away when that guy tried to rape me. Besides, all this "Mission Impossible" stuff beats the hell out of sending out notices for traffic fines, I can tell you. Thank you. So, what law do you want me to break now? Working late? Jodie. What can I do for you? [sighs] You're still mad at me, aren't you? You are, and I don't blame you. Standing you up like that was inexcusable. Twice. You stood me up twice. I don't know why I do things like that, Rex, you know? Maybe I'm just afraid of liking you too much and you hurting me, so it's like I get in first. It's like self-defense. You reckon. Forgive me. Please. Well that depends. On what? On what you want? Rex. Oh, come on. Spit it out. Heard you were looking for a boat going to Oz? What about it? Know a guy might be worth talking to. [music playing] Bang! Hey, Terry. How's it been? Hey, hey, hey. Just chill. Whoa. Be cool. Be cool, man. Be cool. We didn't come here to hurt you, mate. Check it out all right? Yeah? Look, we could have dealt you if we wanted to, all right? We just came here to talk. You all right, Willy? Shit. Do I look all right? - OK. Let's just settle, man. We just want to know, you got those guns? Why? Thought you might be keen on another job. That's all. We talk? [music playing] [gasps] You've got to stop doing that. I hope [inaudible] all right. You know that money I gave you? No, I've forgotten all about it. Uh, I'm going to need some just to buy information and set things up and stuff. Well it's not here obviously. I'm not that blonde. I never said you were. So where is it? Safest place I could think of, at work. Mm. Good, good. So, do you want to know how I got on? This means [inaudible]. All it proves is that the bullets you say you got out of a piece of wood came from a gun that we confiscated in Rotorua that should have been destroyed two weeks ago. You can't prove it came from the gun that was used on the job. What about the guard that was shot? Shotgun's different. Smooth bore, no mags. You can't trace it. So why'd I have to put up with Rex slobbering all over me for? No, no. What this proves is the guns were in police possession. All we have to do is prove that the bad guys have got them. They've got to ask how. Now, I don't have access. But DSS Snow, that's another matter. [typing] [music playing] For what it's worth, I think you'd make a fine police officer. You can try again. All I want to do is talk to him, Jodie. You just want him to help you with your inquiries. The longer he stays away, the worse it looks. Come on. Where is he? I don't know. Your contract allows for instant dismissal should you be deemed a security risk. You have the right of appeal of course, but in this situation, I think you'll find you haven't got a leg to stand on. [music playing] [knock on door] Excuse me, boss. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. That quick end to a brilliant career. I did warn you. Is John still in the country? Excuse me. Tell him to take you and the money and go. I hear the Queensland Police will take anyone. Oh, well you must be crapping yourself. All those years of work down the toilet. Jodie! Hey, how'd you get on with that friend of yours? Yeah, thanks, good. Hey, happy to help. Here, let me help you with that. No, Rex. Damn it! You've just-- you've got to do something about this urge you have to be so damn helpful. It's a real turn off. - Sorry, I was just-- Just forget it, OK? I just hope you take on board what I said. What worries me is if that asshole Snow's been spreading your employment record around, it won't take long for Bowers to hear about it. You can pull out, brother. I mean, there'd be no hard feelings. Never done a payroll before. Besides, some bastard's got to look out for you. [phone ringing] Yeah, yeah. Yeah? How's it going? Not bad. Feel like a drive? Yeah. Just the day for it, eh? John! Johnny, you there? Now the van's going to come around this corner up here. It's going to make a right. Now a bit further down, the road gets narrowed and there's a bank on the other side. So 50 minutes past that, make a left. There's a wee side road. - 2 mil, you reckon? - Yeah. Yeah. It's a week's taking from every bank north of [inaudible],, south of Hamilton. Without extra protection? This is New Zealand, mate. No one thinks it's going to happen twice. The only thing I can't figure out. You've got this job sussed. Why do you need us along to hold your hand? Tell them. Yeah, you got me. It's a setup. Johnny. That's why you've got the gun. We're sitting here like a couple of dickheads. Listen, mate. I'm talking about 2 million bucks here. OK? Who are we going to get to help us, some local idiot who's knocked off a gas station? I'd rather do this with you blokes because you're the best, but with you or without you, I'm going to do it anyway. Let's go. Eh? Drive. If everything checks out, we'll be in touch. Van comes through tomorrow, mate. You miss it, it's another week. Hey. I said we'll be in touch. Here's the thing. If they go for this, there's not good any time to warn anyone. I went there last time. Stick to the plan, totally. Yeah. Yeah, we'll stick to it. You all right, Dave-o? Yeah. Oh, come on, mate. Spit it out. I told Ellis I'd heard the whisper about something downtown. She's but the AOS on standby. You what? Didn't say nothing to me about the Armed Offenders Squad. I thought it might be better. Jesus Christ. I told you I don't want Snow anywhere near this. He'll find some way to screw the both of us. He won't. It just, you know, covers our asses. Yours and mine. By the time the AOS get there, it'll all be done. Thought I might find you here. Good day, Jodie. Hello, darling. How are you today, Jodie? How nice of you to ask, John. Actually, I'm a little bit annoyed because I got the sack today. Really? Would that have anything to do with me? Well it's funny you should ask that, John, actually, but, you know, it's cool, because its worth losing my job for a good cause. John boy. You going to introduce us? Yeah, yeah. Jodie Keane, this is Andy Deakin. Absolutely bloody charmed. And right here, this is Wallace [inaudible] Kaa. Hello, Wallace. It's Willy. So what's this then, a bloody Tupperware party? No. No. Actually, I'm glad you turned up, Jodie. I'm going to team you up with Andy over here, and what he doesn't know about surveillance isn't worth knowing. That wasn't in the plan. Hey. One more thing. Ellis sprung me just as I was into the armaments file. [sighs] It was worth a try anyway. But I got a look first. Snow was in charge of exhibits from that Rotorua job. That's where the guns came from that Rex matched the bullet to. And it's all there on file, it can't be tampered with. Jodie, you're bloody amazing. Have I told you that? Tell me as many times as you like. [chuckles] [kisses] Good luck for tomorrow, and thanks for letting me in. Like I had any choice, eh? Didn't I bend you before? [chuckles] Drunk and disorderly, New Year's Eve, about seven or eight years ago. Thought so. Another? I thought you'd never ask. Johnny's got nothing to lose, eh. But what's in it for you? Would have picked you for a company man all the way. I thought I was too. Being a cop's always been about, you know, shit pay, shit hours, but at least you always knew who your mates were. Now they go and stick it to Johnny like that just for doing his job. Got to draw the line somewhere, eh. You guys in place? OK. No more phone contact, all right? Bowers and his mates will be here soon if they're coming. Roger. It's a dog's life, eh love? [laughing] Is something happening? Not at the moment it's not. There was a whisper whoever knocked off the armored van last week might be planning another job. Could just be talk. I should be involved. That won't be necessary at this stage. Susan, if it's Lawless, we know he's dangerous and we never found the guns from the last time. I'll keep that in mind. That's all. Thank you, Alan. [music playing] You're cutting it fine, aren't you? Well let's go. See. No wallets, no ID, no phone. Who says you can't teach Kiwis anything? I've always thought buying lingerie for a lady, about the nicest thing a bloke could do. What size are you? [phone rings] Hello? Hello? We're on. Hung like a donkey to Ebony and Ivory, come in. WILLY KAA: Is he talking to us? Mad bastard. I'm hearing you, Andy. ANDY DEAKIN: [OVER RADIO] They're on their way. [music playing] How come I don't get one of them? I'll take care of that. Try not to shoot anyone this time, shit head. [cocking weapons] May not be as glamorous, but calling the show is the most important part of a job like this, letting everyone know exactly where they are and what's happening. So you know John pretty well then? I worked a few gigs in Wellington a few years ago, just before I [inaudible]. A bit moody, they said. Right as rain now, as long as I take my little white pills. [music playing] Rubber ducky, looks like you've got a convoy. Yep. OK, I see them. Where's our boy? ANDY DEAKIN: [OVER RADIO] He's in place. Spot on. [dialing phone] DS Bruford for Inspector Ellis. No, I will not hold the frigging line. Put her on now. That van better show, man. Those Aussies will kill us. [breathes deeply] You're good, mate. It's a happening thing. [tires squealing] Get out of the vehicle! Move! [gunshot] Move! Get out! Come on! Now! Move it! We're not joking, get out of the vehicle. Get out of the van! Move! [inaudible] the key. Get on your back now! Move it! Hurry up. Move it! Get back around the front. Go. Get the keys out. I've got them here. I'll unlock the door. Get it going! OK, OK, OK. Put it down! Go on, put it down! Drop the weapon. Drop it! [gunshot] Woo! We got him. It's a wrap. Andy. Andy, look. It's Bowers. He's got a gun. We need an ambulance here fast. Put Ellis on, will you? Come on. You Aussies, I don't know. Can't rob, can't play rugby. What are you good for anyway? Get in the car. Andy to Lawless, over. Get off the frigging radio. [dialing phone] Will do. SUSAN ELLIS: [ON PHONE] It's not over yet, John. You and Bruford have gone way too far on this. Just a minute, Susie. Terry Bowers, you dick head. I owe you a kick in the nuts. [laughing] No! [gunshot] Oh man. Shit, bro. Why do they call these things bulletproof? It hurts like hell. [chuckles] You cheery bastard. Could have been worse, bro. Could've shot you in your thick head. [tires squealing] Go, Dave. I'll get them. We've got to go after him. That's not the plan. Well stuff the plan. [music playing] [tires squealing] [sirens blaring] Come on. What the shit? [tires squealing] You little beauty. [tires squealing] Get out of the car! On the ground now! Hands behind the head! Do it! [music playing] [sighs] SUSAN ELLIS: Come in. Sit. A serious allegation's been made, that you provided guns to criminals from the exhibits locker, guns earmarked for disposal. That's a lie. You're in charge of exhibits is on file. Not even you can change that. Senior Sergeant. I also wrote this report shortly afterwards, also on file. And you're right, I couldn't change that. Detailing my concerns about the security of the exhibits locker. Virtually anyone at the station could have accessed it if they'd so desired. Not me. Perhaps not, but your mate, Sergeant Bruford. You had it covered way back then. Oh, you're still teaching me a thing or two, Alan. There'll be an internal inquiry of course. As there should be. I would also recommend that Detective Constable Lawless be encouraged to join a drug rehabilitation program. And what about Dave? He's been cautioned that his part in this affair exceeded his authority. The guy's a bloody hero. Look, there's no hard feelings, Susan. I know you've been straight up about this. The Australians are denying involvement in the first robbery. Terry Bowers, on the other hand, is singing his head off. He's admitted to shooting the guard. He also insists you've got $40,000. Yeah, well Bowers would say just about anything to drop me in it. Any proof? When this goes to court, it's really going to hit the fan. You'll be better off with the force behind you. I'll take my chances. [door closing] Detective Constable Lawless has never been a team player. You're a prick, Snow. Always have been, always will be. Don't let the bastards get you down, eh? It's not the department I'm worried about, it's Joe. Talk about ballistic. I'll be lucky to sleep in my bed again this year. - Tell her it was my fault. - I already did. Oh yeah? Hey, uh, that money from the robbery. You should use it to go private, you know? Set yourself up. No. That poor bastard who got shot, anonymous donation to his misses. Look, don't beat yourself up about it, eh? It's just bad luck. Yeah, whatever. Hey, you take care of yourself, all right? [music playing] You OK? Been better. Willy told me what happened. I'm sorry. I hardly even knew her. [music playing]
