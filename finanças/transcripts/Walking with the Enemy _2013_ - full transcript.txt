[Hitler delivering a speech in German] [crowd cheering loudly] [♪♪] [Elek] War... it reveals one's true character. And when my homeland became a battleground... [in Russian] Officer, fire. [Elek] ... nothing could prepare me for what was to come. [gun fires] [clamoring] [booming] [rifle cocks] [gun fires] [grunts] [gunfire] [shouting, groaning] [booming] [shouting] [gunfire] [shouting] [shouts orders in German] [♪♪] [swing music playing] [laughter] [joyous shouting] [indistinct dialogue] [Elek] Hitler's war seemed far from us. We went out, we danced. We had other things on our minds. [♪♪] [song ends] [clapping] Ferenc, what about them? [mid-tempo music starts playing] -Lajos? -Yeah. One Minute. Wish me luck. Excuse me. Would you like to dance? Yes, all right. Thank you. What do you do when you're not dancing? -I work in a record shop. -Oh. [Elek] And you? I work in a dress shop. My father's. -Is this one of his? -Of course. A beautiful dress for a beautiful girl. Oh, no, you're a charmer. Every girl knows to stay away from a charmer. Well, I can stop being charming if you like. [chuckling] Good boy. Come. -Andras. -I don't know what's become of this place, letting Jews in here. Excuse me. I could say the same thing about letting you in here. [Elek] What do you think you're doing, huh? He takes up too much space at university, and he takes up too much space in here. He has just as much a right to be here as anybody else. Oh, huh, you're a Je-- [shouting] -[man] Stop it. -[Elek] Get off! Laszlo, how can you even let them in here, huh? Get them out of my club! -Why just us, huh? -What did we do, huh? -Why not them, too? -Now! [shouting] [murmuring] -I can't believe they kicked us out. -I know, but that's not the worst part. -What could be worse? -I didn't get that girl's name. [girls laughing and talking] Elek. -Elek! -Shut up, Ferenc! -[Ferenc] We're late. -I know. Not again. [streetcar bell rings] [Ferenc] We promised Jozsef we wouldn't be late again. Relax. What's he going to do, fire us, huh? Huh? [streetcar bell rings] [bell jingles] Ah, you thought perhaps today was the Sabbath? Sorry we're late. I pay for your time, not your excuses. So, Elek, do you know whose radio this is I am fixing? That is Frau Lustig's, and I was supposed to finish it yesterday, Jozsef. That's right. But now I am fixing it this morning. So if she pays me less because it is not ready on time, are you going to be making up the difference to me? [bell jingles] [Jozsef] Ah, Frau Lustig. Ah, Frau Lustig. [in German] Please pretend you are early for your radio so that Jozsef doesn't dock my pay for going dancing last night. [in German] Dancing? -Did you meet a girl last night? -Yes. [Frau Lustig] Is she pretty? Like the sunrise over the Danube. [Jozsef, in English] Practicing your German, Elek? Jozsef, uh, I know my radio is not expected till tomorrow... It seems that your radio is ready a day early, Frau Lustig. You see? Here, listen. [static crackles] [man on radio] ...over the border, into Hungary early this morning. The people of Hungary wait for word... -[Ferenc] Jozsef, do you want-- -[Jozsef] Shh! [man on radio] ...from their leader, Regent Horthy, who has remained silent since the Nazis started to enter the city. The Führer's stated intention is to stifle the Russian advance. [planes rumbling overhead] Central Command is absolutely certain... [Elek] Overnight, Germany put us in the crosshairs of the allies. Hitler claimed it was to bolster Hungarian defenses. I had a feeling there was another agenda. Back inside, both of you. [man on radio] The Russian-- [radio stops] You must go home. Wouldn't we be safer here than at the apartment? Not the apartment, home. To your village, to your families. You are not safe here! Take the first train, before they shut them down. Pay whatever you must, but get on board. Go. [hissing and screeching] [plane engines rumbling] [♪♪] [Ferenc] No Germans. [Elek] Not yet. -What? -[Ferenc] Labor Service. It says if we don't go, we'll be arrested for treason. And leaving tomorrow. Mr. Farkas. -Is it possible to get a lift? -Of course. -Good to see you. -And you. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] -Thank you, Mr. Farkas. -My pleasure. [smacking lips] [man] Elek. [chuckling] [Elek] Hello, Papa. Oh, come. Your mother will be please to see you. I'm concerned about this call up for the Labor Service. Your cousin did quite well in the Labor Service. That was years ago, Papa. You know, before the Nazis had come to Hungary. It is your duty to serve, for every Hungarian man to serve. Yes, in the army. You know, only the Jews they send to the Labor Service. You'd rather be on the front, fighting the Russians? -Perhaps you are right to be scared. -I'm not scared, Papa. [bell tolling] I just don't trust the Nazis. And I am worried about the family. [Rabbi Cohen] There is no choice in this. If you do not report, the penalty is execution. Rabbi Cohen. Good to see you, Elek. I need to speak with you. I just wanted to know what you plan to do-- if there is any way in which I can help. What do you mean, Janos? Do what? You must leave. The Germans could be here soon. Crimes against Jews have been committed all over Europe. -You must flee. -Flee? You expect me to abandon my congregation? I have always been there for them, and that will never change. Let's not keep your mother waiting. One moment, Papa. Please. Mr. Balacz. I agree with you, but... he won't listen. What should we do? Come and see me later tonight. I know someone who can help. [Mrs. Cohen] A little more salt, Sofila. Avi, stop playing with the food. It's a castle. [Sofi] Avi... Anna, I have a surprise for all the family. -[Mrs. Cohen] Oh, thank God! -[Avi] Elek! -Elek! Elek! -It's good to be home, Mama. Hey, hey. [Sofi] Welcome home. We've missed you. I've missed all of you, too. Wash up now, supper is almost ready. Hey, Avi, after dinner... you can show me that swing of yours. [clicks tongue] What was it like when the Germans came? Sofi, not at the table. We're having supper now. Baruch atah adonai eloheinu melech ha'olam, ha'motzi lechem mein ha'aretz. [clock chiming] -Were you scared? -[Rabbi Cohen] Enough. We are different to them. We have a different faith, different custom. They do not understand us, and people fear what they do not understand. They may cause us trouble, but they will never separate us. [soft knock on door] Come in. Sofi, I've come to say good night. Hey. [sighs] Tell me the truth, Elek. What was it like in the city today? It was bad enough to make me want to come home. What do you think will happen? I really don't know. And you will go off to the Labor Service? When this is all over, and you go back to university, can I still come and visit? Yes, of course you can. And you'll introduce me to your friends. [laughs] No. No, no, no. -Why? -You're too young. Now, go to sleep. -Good night. -Good night. [Elek] Following Mr. Balacz, I knew I was going against my father's wishes, but he refused to listen. -[Balacz] Good evening, Father. -Good to see you, Mr. Balacz. -Hello, Elek. -Father. -Please, come in. I have them ready. -This way. [choir singing in distance] Thank you, Father Dominic. -How many people have you helped? -The less we talk, the better, Elek. We do not want to be compromised. The safety of others depends on us. I understand, Father. God bless you, Elek. Take care, Mr. Balacz. I will, Father. Come. [man] Fazekas Attila. Next. [Elek] One by one, every young man prepared to depart for the labor camp, and we had no idea what to expect. A quick good-bye was all some families got. I am worried what will happen here, Papa. You know, I should be here with the family. You will be soon. -And nothing will have changed. -And how do you know that, huh? I don't. It's what I believe. Good-bye, Papa. I love you, son. -We're all very proud of you. -I love you, too, Mama. Hmm? [Ferenc] Look after Papa. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, Elek. Okay? Go, go, go. You see me off, Sofi. Take this with you. You can give it back to me when you take me to Budapest. [Elek] I need you... to keep these for me. Just keep them to yourself for now, okay? What are they? They're baptismal certificates. If anything bad happens, you give them to Papa. You make him understand. [truck engine starts] [♪♪] [Sorenzi] This is a work camp. You will clear roads, lay track, construct bridges and do anything your country needs. If you work hard, you will make it back to your families. If you try to escape, you will join them. Pull out your pockets. Remove your belongings. Everything will be accounted for and returned when you leave. [man grunts] [guard] Let's see that. Come on, come on, come on. -[guard grunts] -[Elek groans] -[coughing and groaning] -Give me this. I'm all right, I'm all right. Dismissed. Colonel, Herr Stern, head of the Jewish Council and his associates to see you. [Eichmann] Have a seat, gentlemen. I have called you here today, to be sure that you understand. There will be certain restrictions placed upon Jewish activities, all of which are within Hungarian war interests. Can you be specific as to these restrictions? Nothing too burdensome, I assure you. No radios, no telephones, no travel. We will impose a moderate curfew. And Jews will display the yellow star on their clothing. If your people work for the war effort and follow these simple guidelines, our presence here will hardly be felt. And if some do not cooperate? You keep your people in order and, I assure you, no person will be harmed solely on the basis of Jewish classification. Do we understand one another? Yes, Colonel Eichmann. We are loyal Hungarians. Many of us fought side-by-side with the Germans in the Great War. -I myself... -Thank you, gentlemen. You are excused. [Elek] Weeks wore on. And we continued to slave in the wake of the German war machine. Repairing tracks, digging fortifications, burying the dead. Some were too weak to be of any more use. The guards had their way of dealing with them. [coughing] They know he's not well so they work him harder. Then we should help him. Come with me. Come. Together. Hey! -Is this man incapable of doing his job? -No. We finish faster, for you. Get back to work. [door opening] [aide] Herr Eichmann will see you now. Heil Hitler. Colonel Eichmann. It is my pleasure to make your acquaintance. Welcome to my beloved Hungary. I congratulate you on your success throughout Europe. I thank you. The pleasure is all mine, Chairman. Please. Sit. The Arrow Cross Party has, for many years now, opposed Regent Horthy's tolerant policies that have protected the Jews in Hungary. If I am to interpret your presence here rightly, you will find us ready to assist you in removing the Jewish presence. We can do great things together, you and I. [guard] Out! -Out! Out! -[men groaning and coughing] -Out! -[Samuel] Uli, get up. Uli, get up now. Please. Come. -Come, Uli. -[coughing] Uli, listen to me, we have to go now. -Now! -Leave him alone. -[Uli coughs] -Please. Now! [Uli coughing] [gun fires] [men gasp] [banging] [men groaning] [cart squeaking] [Samuel screams] [groaning] Oh, no! [men groaning] [Samuel groaning in pain] Get up. [grimacing] Back to work. [grunting] [rifle cocks] [planes approaching] [Elek] Ferenc, look. Americans. [guards yelling] [rapid gunfire] [guard groans] Elek! [Elek] Go, go, go, go! [Soldier yelling] [Elek] We have to jump. -I can't. -Yes, you can, Ferenc! Come on! [♪♪] Ferenc! [Sorenzi] Stop! [grunts] [Sorenzi] Please... You have your freedom now. Let's go our separate ways. [gun fires] You gave him five more seconds than he deserved. Now... go home. I'll be fine. Thank you. [♪♪] [Elek] I was lucky to be alive. A man I hardly knew saved my life. We thought the Nazis were the only enemy. But the camp was run by Hungarians. We didn't know who we could trust anymore. So we avoided the roads and stuck to the backwoods and the streams. [♪♪] We might even make it home in time for supper. Listen, Ferenc, we have to be careful. Stay out of sight until you get home. I'll see you tomorrow. Come here. [bell tolling] [plates and silverware clanking] Mr. Farkas? [gasps] You promised they'd never come back. Where is my family? [chair banging on floor] Get out of my house. -Your house? -Yes. This is my house now. Your kind are not welcome here anymore! -Get out! -[Ferenc] What have you done with them? Leave my house! Go! -Mr. Farkas... -Gendarme! No! Gendarme! [glass shards crunching] [clattering] [clattering] [Ferenc exhales] Elek? Where are they? [stifled sobbing] [clattering] [♪♪] Elek? Mr. Balacz. [Balacz] It made sense to me then why they called up all the men for Labor Service. It was so easy for them to clear the town of women and children. Why didn't anybody do anything? I thought these were good people. I knew them, their families. My pain was for your people, but... my shame was for mine. [Elek] Where did they go, Mr. Balacz? Where did they take our families? [sighs] Rumors. I heard a gendarme say that... they were moving them to the west because the Russians are moving closer from the east. To protect them. No one is telling us to move for our protection. Only the Jews. [distant booming] [dog barking in distance] [♪♪] It's Farkas. Gendarmes. Quickly, to the basement. -You can stay there-- -Mr. Balacz, we'll go. -But you will be safe there. -But you won't. We'll go. [♪♪] [Elek] Mr. Balacz was a true friend. The others watched our families being taken and stole our homes, as if we meant nothing. Their betrayal left scars that will never heal. [train hissing and chugging] [brakes squeaking] [hisses] -[man] Sieg! -[all] Heil! [car approaching] [door opens, closes] Did you find that information on Colonel Skorzeny? He arrived yesterday. Skorzeny commands Hitler's elite SS troops that broke Mussolini out of prison. What is Berlin contemplating? Stalin murders his own people. Hitler wants to purify the world. Both crave supremacy. How does one choose? Father, you were forced into an impossible decision. I aligned Hungary with what I thought was the lesser of two evils. Our country would have been crushed between them if you didn't choose. Yesterday, Skorzeny met Szalasi and the leaders of the Arrow Cross Party. Szalasi, the Hungarian fascist. The tide of this war has changed. We need to navigate the political waters carefully. [clock chimes] Our hope may rest with the Allies. [knock at door] Excuse me, sir. Colonel Skorzeny is here for his appointment. Thank you. [footsteps approaching] -Welcome. -Regent. This is my son, Miklos. Regent, to be perfectly frank, your resistance to the resettlements of the Jewish population has not gone unnoticed. Jewish labor is required for the war effort. Berlin must know that you are loyal to the the Reich's cause. You are referring to Hungarians. They're not your affair. All policies regarding the war effort are my concern. Now, I am ordering you to give authority over the Jews to Colonel Eichmann. And oil production will be under German control. Chairman Szalasi will be assisting us. The Arrow Cross has no governing authority here. The Führer needs our full support if we are to stay strong and resist the Bolshevik barbarians. You have no need to advise me, Chairman. Regent, as you know, noncompliance with Berlin... is treason. Good day. [door closes] The Jews have Eichmann. We have Skorzeny. All will be tested. [train clattering on tracks] Ferenc. Ferenc! I think we're close. [train screeches] [Elek] We arrived back in Budapest only to find the Jewish quarter looted and abandoned. [bell tolling] Even where we worked. He might be home. Jozsef? Jozsef, it's Elek. My God, boys! -How did you-- -Frau Lustig... we're looking for Jozsef. He won't be back. [Ferenc] What do you mean he won't be back? -What happened? -He does not live here anymore. They have moved all of the Jews to the Yellow Star houses. Frau Lustig, you have to tell us where Jozsef is, please. I have the address. [train bell dinging] [Ferenc] Isn't that girl from the club? [Elek] Hannah? Elek, Ferenc, it's so good to see you. We never see anyone come back. How has life come to this, hmm? I don't know. How's Rachel? She's fine. We're all living in a Yellow Star house. That's what we're looking for. Number, um, 18, -Bojnok Utca. -That's my building. Do you know if there is a man there called Jozsef Greenberg? Yes. Yes, he's there now. -[sighs] -I have to get back to work, but I'll be back there later. Okay. It's good to see you. You, too. [Elek] Jozsef! [Jozsef] Elek... Ferenc, what... Welcome home, boys! Come, come. What are you doing here? [Elek] You would not believe what has happened. Thank you again, Mrs. Schoen. It's not very strong, but it's all we have. Thank you. I wish I knew something about your families' whereabouts. You deserve more after what you've been through. Do you believe it? Do you believe that our families were taken away to work? It's hard to imagine the Germans would need all of them. There are other possibilities. Oh, spare us. -Don't confuse them anymore. -Well, they deserve to know everything. It's from my sister. She lived just outside the city. [Elek] What is it? What is... -Waldensee? -It's a lie. -You don't know that. -Well, it's no damn resort. Who ever heard of it, huh? -No one. -[Rachel] Look here. The whole card, she writes in Hungarian. But in Hebrew, she signs, "zeh lo nachon," which means... [both] It is not true. -Why would she write that? -Well, which is it? Factories in support of the war, this... this... Waldensee? I'm sorry, Elek. No... we just don't know. -Why haven't they taken everyone here? -[Ferenc] Elek. [Jozsef] They might. But, for now... we depend on these. It is a Schutz-passe. Gives you protection. [hammering] [footsteps approaching] [Jacob] I use this machine every day. Try it now. [rumbling] [chuckles] It works. For now. Anything else you'd like me to help you with, Jacob? [Hannah] Uncle Miklos, leave Jacob alone. -What are you doing? -Going home. Not before I get a kiss. I suppose you've earned it. [giggles] Mwah. Good night, Uncle. Where's my kiss? I guess you didn't earn it. [loud laughing] Hello, Fräulein. [distant whistling and cheering] -[in German] What a beautiful night. -[laughs] So alone. And no one with you. [in German] Where are you going? [distantly] Where are you going? -Wait! -[laughs] [♪♪] [both laugh] [♪♪] [panting] [laughing] [door knob rattling] Please. [gasping] [door slams] [Hannah gasping] Papa! Papa, Germans. Germans! [banging] [muffled crying] [Hannah continues crying softly] [Soldier, in German] Out, out! -Come here. -No. [Hannah cries] -[in German] Come on. -No, no! -No! -[in German] Come on! [Hannah cries] -Please, sir, I beg you. -[Hannah] Papa, no! -You can have anything you want. -[in German] Shut up. Please, it's my daughter. [gun fires] [screaming] No! [Elek] No, no, no. Mr. Schoen! -[crying] No. -[Elek] Mr. Schoen. [Hannah] Papa! -[Soldier 1] Out! -[Soldier 2] Out, now! Out, out, out! -Mr. Schoen. -[screaming] Please, please. [in German] Be quiet. [Hannah screaming] [Hannah whimpers] [Hannah] No! -Papa! Please, please. -Mr. Schoen. [Hannah sobbing] [whimpering] -[in German] Be quiet. -[crying] [crying continues] [groans] -[Hannah sobbing] -Papa! [panting] [Hannah screams] -[screams] Hannah! -Shh! Wait. Wait here. [Hannah screams] [banging] [♪♪] [gun fires] [grunting] [in German] Good bye, Jew. [thumping] [grunting] [Elek] Wait. Stop. [wet smacking] Stop. Stop. Stop. -[wailing] -Stop. Shh, shh. Shh, shh. It's over. Shh. [panting] [man] What happens when they are discovered missing? Someone must have seen them enter the building. Or heard the gunshots. We can't stay here. I know. We must find a new home. Tomorrow. [loud murmuring] -Are you okay? -Yes. My Uncle Miklos says we can stay. It's not home, but... at least we'll be safe here. It's called the Glass House. It used to be an old glass factory, but now the Swiss use it to make protective passports. If it's okay, my uncle would like to talk to you. [Miklos] You saved my niece. For that I thank you. On the other hand, two German officers were killed. -SS, no less. -I know. They look for their dead. They start asking questions. We don't need questions here. My niece speaks well of you. You have chutzpah. Come with me. We can't fight the Nazis with guns, but we can save many lives with straight diplomacy. -Lajos? -Elek! [both chuckle] Ah, it's good to see you. Ah, you know him? [Lajos] Yes. He's a good friend. You can trust him. Good. This is a Swiss passport. We need runners to deliver them. I'll do it. Your identification as a Swiss employee. Any Nazis or Arrow Cross who stop you should respect it. Personally, I recommend not being stopped. [Elek] I didn't hesitate to help Miklos. And by doing this... Irma Schomo? ...I might find my own family. -Dara... -Yes. -Gutra? -Yes. Andras Shendorivog? It's for you. Oh. Thank you. [Krieger] Where is the radio? [crying] Radios are not permitted. Go. [rapid gunfire] [screaming] [Krieger] Go. [truck engine starts] [boy] Mama. [sniffles] Mama. [crying and sniffling] -Please. -Hey. [exhales] [Elek] Shh. I'm sorry. Hey. -[sobs quietly] -Now, come on. But you can't stay here. It's not safe. [inhales] -Cannot stay. -Where else is he to go, Miklos? -This is not a dormitory. -[Hannah] Everyone can hear you. He can hear you. [door closes] This is a diplomatic mission. No place for an orphan boy. Find a proper place for him. [♪♪] I'm sorry, sir. Colonel Skorzeny is early. -Show him in. -[woman] All right, sir. -Colonel. -Good day, Regent. Colonel. You know Consul Lutz. Herr Lutz is precisely why I've called this meeting. You are requesting Swiss passports for Hungarian Jews. In this city alone, there are over 7,000 Jews with family ties to Swiss citizens. I granted the request. The Swiss are neutral in this war. Transferring citizenship is a German matter. Colonel, we are still a sovereign nation. [Lutz] And Switzerland has acted as intermediary for Germany with the Allies. [Horthy, Jr.] Do you want to put a strain on your relationship with the Swiss over a few thousand citizens? They are one of the last countries willing to assist Germany with diplomacy in this war. Colonel Eichmann will have to deal with this issue. You are to cease transferring citizenship until further notice. Failure to cooperate will have consequences. Colonel, I will not be intimidated. [typewriters clacking in distance] [Elek] How is Hannah's food? [grunts] You remind me of my brother. Always playing with his food. How's the food? Oh, he loves it. Adam, I have a friend I would like you to meet. I grew up with her, and she looks after lots of girls and boys like you. Okay? [♪♪] [knocking at door] [Marketa] Oh, Hannah. -It's so good to see you. -How are you? Please, come in, come in. ♪ Every day when the Sun comes up ♪ ♪ Lightens up the beauty of life ♪ Would you like to come meet everyone? Yes. ♪ Or the stars shine bright ♪ ♪ We sing a carol in the morning ♪ ♪ We sing a song ♪ [Elek] Adam? You'll be safe here. We'll be back. ♪ Singing the lullaby ♪ Thank you, Marketa. [Marketa] This is... -This is Martin. -Hello. [door closes] I hope Adam is okay. He's lucky to have you. -[nun clears throat] -[Elek chuckles] Come on. -[sighs] -Come on. [Horthy, Jr.] It's time. How many decoys? Two cars. Our men have been observing the meeting location for the past several days. No activity. -Can we trust them? -Do we have a choice? [♪♪] Sir. [♪♪] Pleased to meet you, Regent Horthy. I trust we have an agreement with Premier Stalin. Regent, we worked diligently to gain acceptance for your proposal with Russia. But to no success. Our terms of surrender, our conditions are reasonable. What does the premier not understand? If we appeal again, Comrade Stalin will be insulted. Do you want to risk the concessions he has granted? We must find middle ground. If you do not accept Comrade Stalin's agreement, your country is looking at a bloodbath. This is unfortunate. Premier Stalin must await my answer. [rumbling and clanking] No, Tomas. You got Consul Lutz's signature wrong. -Here. -Let's switch for a while, Tomas. You stamp, I'll sign. Here is another 500. Jacob said the press can't keep working 24 hours a day. Tell Jacob the printer has to keep working. -He said we're at over 25,000. -25,000? Does my uncle know? He knows. But he doesn't know. He doesn't want to risk the diplomatic status of the Swiss. The Swiss are done, Hannah. Seven thousand eight hundred was the official number. There are about 200,000 Jews left in Budapest. This piece of paper is someone's life. [♪♪] -Janos Grossman? -Yes. Thank you. I thank you. [woman] Bless you, sir. Get inside. [man] There she is. [♪♪] Give me this. -Swiss passes. -They're legal. -So why are you so nervous? -There's a lot of them. Take him. [♪♪] [screams echoing] [door closes] Your identification says you are Kovacz Janus, a Christian. So tell me, why are you carrying so many Swiss documents meant for Jews? Where do these papers come from? Are they false? [groaning, coughing] You do not want to speak. I understand. It's very brave of you. I have met many men like you on this very spot. And let me tell you, those who went home to their families were not the brave ones. [shouting, groaning] [♪♪] [strained gasping] No. Not so fast. Where did you get them? Where did you get the papers? -Huh? -[groans] Speak. [gasps weakly, coughs] -Talk! -[moans] -Miklos was very clear about the risks. -I understand that. But we can't just leave him. Can you imagine what he's going through right now? I know, but what can we do? The only people who can get near him now are the SS. We're getting him out. Tonight. I've had this beard for more years than I care to remember. It'll grow back. [♪♪] [shovel scraping] [grunting] [Elek] It's okay. We'll brush them down. Elek? You know if you are caught... Then we will be no worse off than Ferenc. [♪♪] -[clears throat] -[grunting] We've come about the prisoner. -Which prisoner are you looking for? -A new arrival. He was arrested carrying Swiss documents. -Oh, that one. -[chuckles] He's dead. We want to see him. [man] He's dead. [Elek] Out! Get out! The Gestapo needed this man alive! [quick footsteps approach] -What is going on here? -[Lajos] You have killed this prisoner. -[Varga] What prisoner? -[man] The one with the Swiss passes. This is not the one. Next cell. [♪♪] [Varga] Here he is. A good beating, but not dead. And not speaking, either. Get him up. Get him up! Stop. I'll need the transfer paperwork-- The Gestapo doesn't care about your damn paperwork. Now... we are taking this man or you will be hanging on the gallows. Where is the evidence? [car door opens] [indistinct German dialogue] [Soldier, in German] Do you have a light? Oh, yes. Yes. [♪♪] Bringing in another one. What is going on here, Lieutenant? We need this prisoner for questioning and the damned Arrow Cross almost killed him. You don't look familiar, Lieutenant. I just transferred in. These people do not know their place. I only want the transfer orders. How dare you talk to a German officer like that. Forget about his prisoner. Take this one. [door opens] [car engine starts] Put him in the back. [car engine revs] [♪♪] [Elek] I knew it was reckless how we saved Ferenc that night. But I couldn't let my friend die at their hands. [Miklos] They didn't have to follow you, look at you. Imagine if they caught you like this, discovered your work here. Miklos! We saved Ferenc. Yes, and we're all very impressed. But when will you understand each time you save one, you risk thousands? You want to be a hero, dress up as a Nazi? Fine. But not under this roof. Thank you, Rachel. It's good to have you back. That's the fourth girl today to bring me lunch. You know every single girl in there is in love with you now. Ferenc, the man who defied the Arrow Cross. Quite a price to pay for all the attention. I can't thank you enough for getting me out of there, Elek. But I don't think I can go out again. Hey. You don't worry about that. You just concentrate on getting yourself better. [rain spatters on roof] [door opens] [door closes] [Grudez] Welcome, Mr. Horthy. [Horthy, Jr.] We have agreed to all Premier Stalin's conditions. How soon will they be delivered? We leave for Moscow immediately. This should end the bloodshed on both sides. [Grudez] Perhaps. Hitler executed a treaty with Comrade Stalin to jointly destroy Poland. Then he ignored the treaty and made war on Russia. Sometimes document is worthless. Our country has executed Premier Stalin's armistice which the British and Americans required of us. We expect all allies to honor the agreement. [man on radio] ...officially over. That is the news from the offices of Regent Horthy. Hungary has negotiated a cease-fire with Stalin's army. The war here is over. Everyone! Listen! The war is over! The Nazis have surrendered? Not the Nazis, us. Horthy, the Hungarians. We've surrendered to the Allies. [cheering] [clapping] [singing in Hungarian] [Elek] People don't normally celebrate the surrender. -[radio broadcast continues] -But to us, the news from Regent Horthy was the best we could hope for, and it quickly spread throughout the city. Regent. The Americans and the British have been informed of the armistice. [distant booming] [gunfire] Sir, the Germans are attacking the palace and our guards are falling. Everyone. We cannot miss a single document connected with the Allies. Not a single one! [banging] [Soldiers yelling indistinctly] [man] Get down! [♪♪] [shouting] [door opens] You are a traitor to Hungary and your allegiance with the Führer. It is the Führer that has betrayed this country. There's nothing you can do now. My son has already delivered the armistice documents to the Allies. -He has? -[indistinct shouting] [groans] They never reached their destination. Regent, your resignation. This is an outrage! Relinquish your power or you will witness the execution of your son. Don't sign it. [gun fires] You... You can never expect to win the... the allegiance of Hungary by such means. I have informed a representative of the German Reich that Hungary is about to conclude an armistice -[guard] Take them out. Everybody out. -with our previous enemies, -and to cease all hostilities -[guard] Stop talking. Let's go. against them. To cease all hostilities against them! Free Hungary! Set Hungary free! -[glass breaks, woman screams] -[Elek] Come on, come on. [radio static] [Arrow Cross member on radio] ...for the citizens of Hungary, that the Arrow Cross has formed an alliance with the Führer -of the German Reich and Szalasi. -Szalasi? -The cowardly armistice in place -Where is Horthy? by the previous regime has been terminated. [man] Terminated? All Hungarian troops are ordered to continue fighting to defend the homeland against the barbaric Red threat. -What does it mean? -It's a coup. The Arrow Cross have taken power. [broadcast continues in background [♪♪] [gun fires] [thudding] Berlin has the iron hand. I must return to Germany. [woman crying softly] [gun fires] [thudding] [♪♪] Jewish. [man grunts] [indistinct conversations] [people shouting] [screaming] [clamoring] Hannah! Hannah! No! Hannah! [yelling] Open the door! Let them in! Let them in. -Come. Quickly, quickly. -[clamoring] Quick as you can. No! Hannah! -[Hannah crying] -Where's Rachel? [crying] Hannah! Let go of me! [guard speaking Hungarian] [gun fires] [Rachel shrieks] [Hannah] Rachel! [truck engine starts] -[crowd shouting] -Rachel! Rachel! [sobbing] Please. Rachel! Ah! Rachel... [sobbing] Hannah. Please. please. [sobbing] -No. Rachel! -Hannah! [shouting] [footsteps approaching quickly] -[Hannah] They've taken Rachel. -[Elek] I know. -I can't lose my sister. -Hannah... We'll bring her back. -[car approaches] -[indistinct conversation] -[people crying] -[indistinct talking] [crying, speaks in Hungarian] [distant gunshot] [distant gunshot] -Please, no! Please, please! Please! -Come on. Come on. [gun fires] [sobbing] -Wait! -[woman screams] Please! [Rachel] Why are you doing this? [sobbing quietly] [gun cocks] [Rachel quiets] [Rachel whimpering] [crying quietly] [gun fires] [thudding] [shuddering] [gun fires] [thudding] [gun fires] [gasps] [shuddering] [gun clicks] [gun reloading] [panting] [gun cocks] [indistinct whispering] [Elek] Stop! These Jews are protected by Swiss passports. [Dorian] Who cares about the Swiss? -The Arrow Cross is in charge-- -The Reich is in charge! The Führer is in charge! And he will not have his interests with Switzerland jeopardized by a bunch of drunks in uniform! [breathing rapidly] All right. [whimpers] [gun fires] [rattling] Just this one. [truck engine starts] [door closes] [truck rumbling] [♪♪] [♪♪] [gasps softly] I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do. Oh... [exhales] [Hannah sobs] Oh... [Mrs. Schoen sobbing] [sobbing loudly] [Elek] The uniform wasn't enough to save Rachel. Now, with the Arrow Cross and Szalasi in power, it would only get worse. -Heil Hitler! -[all] Heil Hitler! The Führer, Adolf Hitler, once said, "Do not be misled into thinking you can fight a disease without killing the carrier." This Jewish contamination will not subside. This poisoning of the nation will not end until the carrier himself has been banished from our midst! [crowd cheering, applauding] [train hissing, rumbling] [hissing, whooshing] [♪♪] [woman wailing] [♪♪] [muffled clamoring] [pounding on walls] [people shouting indistinctly] [pounding continues] [shouting, screaming] It's our job. Accept it. [muffled screaming] [pounding on walls] [deep rumbling, whooshing] Major Wisliceny for Colonel Eichmann. The showers and ovens are functioning as anticipated. -The shipments are running at capacity? -Yes, sir. Approximately 10,000 per day. -We are ahead of schedule. -Yes, sir. Heil Hitler. Elek, you're just going to expect to bump into a Nazi, and what, he's going to tell you something useful? It's a club, Ferenc. People drink, people talk, do they not? We need to find our families. Now, come on, don't worry. [violin playing gently] -Cognac. -Ah. From the Arrow Cross prison. -How are you? -Good. Did you get the information you needed from the prisoner? Yeah. Well, gentlemen, enjoy your evening. Why wouldn't we, huh? We have good foods, good wine... and the great women. [Krieger chuckles] -You are alone? -Uh-huh. I have some girls at my table. -Uh... you will join me, hmm? -Of course. Come. [woman laughs] [woman giggles] Apologies. I have left you for too long. So, Budapest-- it's nice, but, uh, it's nothing like Berlin. -Have you ever been? -I have never been. But once we have smashed the will of the Russians, then... then I intend to. Still... we can take care of the Jewish problem more smoothly. We can start at the north end of the town, march them right down to the train station. Hmm. First thing this week. -That soon? -Yes, we, uh... clear every town and village outside of Budapest in... what was it? -Six weeks. -[Krieger] Six weeks! I wager we can clear the whole city in six days. I heard a woman say her sister went to a place called, um... Waldensee. [laughs] She thought it was a resort or something. [laughing] [chuckles] [Krieger and others continue laughing] [laughing] Resort. Those Jewish... [exhales] What is your name? Mueller. Mueller. Mueller. Hmm. Mueller! Who is your commanding officer, Mueller? Excuse me. I see my friends. -I'll be right back. -Yes. Uh, bring them here, and-and come join us, huh? And bring more wine, Mueller. [♪♪] [air raid siren wailing in distance] [booming] [Elek] It's hard to describe how deep the truth cuts. I felt numb. I don't care what happens to me. I will fight them to the end. [Ferenc] My father and I would take Elek hunting. He would always come home with the most game. I enjoy hunting, but the game never shot back. Well, let's hope with the uniforms we don't have to use these. If we don't try to save the others, who will? [♪♪] [indistinct shouting] [man yells] [gun firing] [♪♪] Remember, we are Nazis-- be confident and they won't interfere. [Elek] Down here! Down this way! Move! Hey. Hey, what are you doing? We're taking them to the train station. You take those to the train station. We are taking these to dig tank ditches. You're taking children to dig tank ditches? Always keep their families together, -they work harder. -You'll have to find others. We have our orders. Everybody! -Back with the others! Back in line! -You! We cannot give you these Jews. You have no choice. Look. [guard] To dig ditches? And then what will you do with them? [chuckles] What do you think we'll do? -Please don't take my children. -No talking! -Please, sir, please let us go. -Stop! -[screaming] -No! [women sobbing] [quietly] I'm a Jew. You'll be all right. Do as I say. Now, walk. Walk! [♪♪] [indistinct chatter] There's so many of them. You didn't see how many were left behind. You can't think of it like that. You should look at the faces of those you did save. It gives us all hope. It's not enough. Hannah... every Jew in Budapest will be on a train within the week. [train chugging, squeaking] [♪♪] [man, in German] Out! Out! [Elek] Day and night, we went on rescue missions as Eichmann increased deportations. [♪♪] The more people we transported to safety in the Glass House... the riskier it became. On the truck! Get on the truck! Move! [indistinct chatter] Come, please hurry. [loud chatter] [man] Elek. -Thank you, sir. Thank you. -You're welcome. [crying] God bless you! Shh, shh, shh... It's okay. It's okay. You're here now, okay? [crying] Thank you. [grunts] Good. That is the last sack of flour. Here, let me take that. [Elek groans] You may scare some people with this new look. What do you mean? -[Elek laughs softly] -[Hannah] Hmm. [footsteps approaching] I see I should find more work for the both of you. [Miklos chuckles] Pastor Novak and his wife are here to see you. They are waiting in the courtyard. Good to see you again, Pastor Novak. What can I do for you? We were hiding Jews in our church. Someone alerted the Arrow Cross. My wife overheard the Arrow Cross saying they were taking them to the river. [gun cocks] [crying] [gun fires] [people scream] [woman crying] [man shouting] Elek, there's too many of them. This is not the time to turn back. -You! -[gun fires] Come here. Orders to take these people to help build fortifications against the Russians. I'll need to check this with my commander. No. Stop, and then you check with your commander. Stop the firing! [Dorian] Why are we stopping? [♪♪] Lieutenant, you are here to stop me again? -Are you questioning me? -I have a job to do. Your job is to take orders from me. -[men panting] -[woman yelling] Kill them all! [guns firing] [yelling] [gun fires] [grunts] [guns fire] [people shouting] [rapid gunfire] [woman screams] No! [man grunts] [woman shrieks] [shouting continues] [rapid gunfire] -[grunts] -Lajos? [rapid gunfire] [booming] -Listen, shh. Hold on! -[loud gasping] You're going to be okay. -[Ferenc] Lajos! -[Lajos pants loudly] Get this off me. I don't want to die in this. You're not going to die. Listen to me. -Look at me! Stay with us. -[groaning] Lajos! Lajos! Stay with us! -Lajos! -[Elek] Lajos! -[Ferenc] Lajos! -[Elek] Lajos! [Ferenc] Lajos! [crying] [Ferenc] I'm done. I will not do this anymore. You have to stop this. -I can't. -What do you mean, you can't? We have to keep going, Ferenc. Why? Why do we have to? -We've saved so many people already. -But there are more people out there! There will always be more, Elek! You cannot stop the Nazis. They will continue to kill us with or without your efforts. And why does it have to be you? Why are you doing this? Because I have nothing left! Because they have taken everything from me! Everything I have loved, everything I have known. It's gone! They're all gone, Ferenc! I mean, doesn't it hurt that they've taken your family? Huh? Your father, or your brother? -What am I supposed to do? -What are you supposed to do? You can make sure that it doesn't happen to others. That they don't have to share that same loss. All I can do is wait for the madness to end and pray that it ends soon. [scoffs] Well, that is where you and I differ, Ferenc. Because I cannot wait for others to decide my fate. [Krieger] All railroad lines converging on Budapest have been cut off. We can no longer transport the Jews. How long to have them repaired? They are not damaged, Colonel. They are destroyed. The Russians have control of the eastern roads, but the western roads, toward Austria, are still ours? Mm-hmm, correct. [Miklos] No matter how bad the war gets, they will finish what they started. Thousands of mostly women and children are being taken to Austria. They claim their factories are short of workers. Their propaganda. [sighs] It doesn't matter, Elek. Wherever they are going, they will be dead before they get there. They're being marched on foot as we speak. Do they still recognize the Schutz-passes? -As far as I know. -Then you need to call the Swiss Consul. [Elek] The line stretched for miles. I didn't know how many we could save. -[man] We need to keep them moving! -[Lutz] Later. Put the bench down. Nobody is taking another step until I find the people carrying Swiss passports. [man] We don't care about your damn passports. I said, keep them moving! [Lutz] You have no justification for holding us here. Hey! What is this? These people are to keep moving. -He won't move, sir. -I am Carl Lutz... Swiss Consul. Yeah, this isn't Switzerland. There are people here carrying Swiss protective passes. They are Swiss citizens. I am not leaving without them. Let him have his damn Jews. -You move these trucks. -Yes. Good. Let me see. Schutz-passe. Yes. Next. Go on. [♪♪] [trucks rumbling] [Lutz] Get on as quickly as you can. Passes, please. What is going on here? -Mueller! -Swiss Consul, sir. -[Lutz] Swiss passes. -Mr. Lutz? You have no authority here. There are people here carrying Swiss protective passes. Colonel Eichmann himself recognizes their authority. Search every person on this truck. Remove anyone who does not have an authentic Swiss pass! We did that, sir. And I would prefer if we did not waste any more of our-- Is this a Swiss pass? -No, sir. -What is it? Newsprint, sir. Newsprint? Well, now you know the difference, check them again. All of them! Remove anyone with any newsprint! [Elek] Get off the truck! Now! Get them down off the truck! Get over here. Give me your pass, huh? Move! [Elek] Come! [sighs] [Elek] Get off the truck! [♪♪] Put your passes in the air! Hold your passes! Let me see. What is that, huh? What is that? Get over there! Let me see, huh? What is it? Move! Put it up, please! Go! Get on the truck. You. You, truck. You, truck. Over there. Come. Truck. There. Hold it up, please. Go down there. Passes. Where's your pass? And you. Where's your pass? Huh? Get out! Move! You have no paperwork for these? Then they were trying to escape. Kill them. [gasping, shouting] Mueller! Come with me! Down here! Come! Come with me down to the woods! -[Krieger] No time for that! -[creaking] No. Please. [people shouting] Please! [people yelling] [shell casings clinking] [loon calling] It's not your fault. I saw over a hundred people killed today. I can still see the terror on their faces as I dragged them off a truck. For a moment, you gave them hope. [sighs] More hope than they've had in months. You've done enough. You can't fool them forever. Elek, I love you. I don't want to lose you. [♪♪] The Führer has denied our request to abandon the city and take up new defensive positions to the west. They've ordered us to fight to the last man. The city will soon be encircled, making retreat impossible. Your car is ready. Where will you be if I need to find you? I am going to Berlin. You have your orders. -Carry on. -Yes, Herr Colonel. [airplane roaring overhead] [indistinct chatter] [car engine revs] [♪♪] [Hannah] Elek. Ferenc told me you were going to an Arrow Cross meeting. Hannah, please... don't ask me not to go. I'm not. I'm asking you to come back. I love you. [Szalasi] Victory over the Russians is within reach. [applause] The Jews are collaborating with our enemies. The time has come where no place can be safe for them. And we will begin today, at the Glass House, by arresting its leader, Miklos Schoen. [applause] This spy and conspirator can no longer be protected from his crimes! [booming] [gunfire] [indistinct shouting] [shouting continues] [Miklos] You are trespassing on Swiss soil. You cannot be in here. This building is protected by the Swiss delegation. [Miklos grunts] [gun fires] There... I'm not on Swiss soil anymore. And neither are you. [vehicle approaching] Officer, stop! Enough! No more of this now. You risk your life for these? Our differences of opinion on the Jews is not the issue here. You are invading a Swiss diplomatic mission, -and I am ordering you... -You are ordering me? Yes. Ordering. [♪♪] [truck engine starts] [car doors close] [truck rumbling] [footsteps approaching] [gun fires] [thudding] [artillery fire in distance] [♪♪] [in Russian] Officer, fire. [clamoring] [booming] [booming] [gun fires] [screaming] [booming] [gunfire continues] [shouting] [screaming] [rapid gunfire] [booming] The Russians have broken through our perimeter lines, here and here. From Berlin. [distant booming] The Führer orders that everyone is to maintain their position. [distant boom] [generator whirring] We will pull back. [booming] [debris clattering] [coughing] [♪♪] Coward! [grunting] Enough! [shouts indistinctly] [booming] [shrieking] [shrieking] [airplane rumbles overhead] [muffled booming in distance] -[explosion] -[gasping] [telephone ringing] Hello? -[Marketa] Hannah. -Marketa? [booming] The fighting is very close. We cannot stay here. Wait there. We will come for you. [distant booming] [wind whistling] [footsteps approaching] [distant gunfire] Elek. Miklos is dead. Miklos. The others are downstairs. [low, indistinct chatter] [chatter stops] Elek, with Miklos gone, what will happen? It will be difficult without him. But the war will soon be over, and we cannot lose hope. Ferenc, wh... where is Hannah? She went with Jozsef to the convent to bring them all back here, but they have not returned. I'm going after them. [booming] [relieved sigh] -[Marketa] Thank goodness! -How are you? We must hurry. [booming] [panicked shouting] [woman screams] [whooshing] [booming] [shouting] [♪♪] [man screaming] [rapid gunfire] [grunting] -Ferenc! -[groans] [grunts] [shouting] [Elek] Get him to the back. I'm fine. You and Ari keep going. Ari, you stay with him. Do not leave his side. Ferenc, you're going to be okay. I will find them. Do not leave him. [scattered gunfire] [screaming] [rapid gunfire] [screaming] [booming] [♪♪] [in German] Assume your positions. -No, no. Other way, other way. -Halt! Where are you going? I asked you a question. Where are you going? We were at the convent. The fighting, it came too close. We had to leave. We need to see your papers. Papers. Swiss passports. -They are Jews. -[Jozsef] No, no. [man] They are Jews. Why are you helping them! -[desperate murmuring] -Quiet! Please. Please just let us go. [murmuring continues] Against the wall! -[murmurs cease] -[Elek] Wait! Wait! -What are you doing? -They are Jews! Have you not seen the battle going on around you? There are more important issues now than killing a bunch of damn Jews! Mueller! What are you doing here? The Russians outnumber us, four to one, and-and they are killing women and children. They're Jews, sir. Kill them. No one shoots! This is not your decision to make. No more killing! [Klein] Lieutenant! Who are these people? This is a Jewish problem. -Why are you protecting these-- -Forget about the Jews! The Russians are everywhere! We are surrounded, and they are killing Germans! Lieutenant, let these people go. I follow Colonel Eichmann's orders. Eichmann? Eichmann has fled, you fool. I am in command now. And I need men defending the city, not murdering innocent children and-and women. Now, back to your posts, all of you! Now! Now, Lieutenant. [♪♪] -Elek! -No! Elek, come with us back to the Glass House. Elek! [gun fires] [shrieking] [♪♪] No! -[Hannah crying] -No. [gun fires] Elek! [thudding] Elek... [Hannah crying] [Elek breathing shallowly] I love you. I love you, too. [sobbing quietly] [♪♪] Oh, please, don't... [♪♪] [Hannah] Please don't leave me. Please, God. [car brakes squeak] [festive music playing] ["Hava Nagila" playing] [indistinct chatter] Can Grandma show off Rachel and Sofi to some of her friends? Of course, Mama. Come on! [♪♪] What a wonderful wedding for your son. Thank you. [dinging] Excuse me. Um... I'd like to propose a toast to my wonderful bride. To Maria. [all] Maria! You know, I'm, um... I'm a very blessed person. I have good friends and family. Some of you might know my parents were killed in the war. I was a child with... nowhere to go, until one man... rescued me and put me into the safety of an orphanage in a church. Then, after the war, I was adopted, and my new parents took me to America... where they brought me up as if I was their own son. They taught me how to appreciate life, the truth... [exhales] and happiness. Now, I know my father would not want me to say anything, but... I know I'm not alone in wanting to thank him. The truth is that I and, um... thousands of others... would not be alive today... if it were not for him. [exhales] If it were not for my father... Elek Cohen. [♪♪] [applause] [Elek] Looking in the faces of those who survived, I see echoes of the ones we lost. Family... friends... and many others. We carry them with us so they will always live on. Hey. -I love you. -I love you, too. [♪♪] [♪♪]
