THE OKLAHOMA KID Subrip: Pix The gentlemen of the press, Mr. President. Good. Let them come in. President Cleveland will receive you now, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I'm at your service. Mr. Cleveland, we'd like to know what you're going to do about the Indian appropriations bill. During my previous term in office, I was opposed of the opening of any Oklahoma territory to white settlement because I felt the terms were unfair to the Indians. The cherokee strip contains 6 million acres of the finest farming land in America. It is our last free frontier. It's 180 miles long and 50 miles wide, but both houses have now approved the measure, and since I happen to believe that the will of the people is properly expressed through the congress, I will sign the bill, and I'm issuing this proclamation. That's it, boys. They pay off the injuns, and we move in! Get that cherokee silver, Joe. We're in. Right. Who'll sign for this money? I will. Hear that stuff clink when they set it down? Yeah. I kind of like that sound. Good luck. All right, throw down those guns. Get 'em up. Now fork over those moneybags. Unhook this lead horse. All right. Come on. Come on. Get up. Hey! Hey! Whip, it's a holdup! All right, get cover, boys! Come here. I've had time to survey the whole cherokee strip, and as most of you know, the section we've chosen is perfect for a town site. It's flat, and there's plenty of water. The Texas cattle trails run down through here, and the sante fe railroad can build their line down here from Wichita. And they will build it, too. We'll give them a decent town and decent trade. All around are thousands of acres of the richest land in Oklahoma, and it'll all be peopled by this time tomorrow... Folks that will need doctors, lawyers, merchants. It's a new start for all of us, but it's going to mean a lot of hard work, and it's going to mean sticking together for the common good, and it's going to mean getting there first tomorrow. Now, there may be some trouble because I've been watched and trailed by men who probably aim to beat us to our town site, but they won't, for when that shot is fired, my son and I, with our fastest riders, will race across prairies and stake a claim. The rest of you can follow with wagons and camp equipment. Now, is that clear? Yeah. All right, then. Good luck to everybody. Let's take a look at that map. John, you know I envy you. It's a great plan. I wish I could be with you. You will be later, judge. Pop's counting on you bringing law into this territory, judge. That's going to be some job, judging from the scum of the west I've seen drifting in here. Won't be too big a job for you, dad. You think one poor old judge can make the whole robber's roost behave? If anybody can. Seems I've raised an optimist, ned. Come on, John. There'll be a lot of changes in our lives after tomorrow. First, you'll be riding circuit with your father, and I'll be helping to start a new town. Aren't you thrilled? I would be if it didn't mean us being separated. Tulsa will spring up overnight, ned, and we'll soon be settled there with father holding court and sending dangerous outlaws to jail. I soon as I get there, I'm going to claim the most beautiful spot of all for us. Ned, isn't it wonderful? A whole new life ahead of us, a whole new city, and soon a new state, and it all begins tomorrow. Get your partners for a dance! Ned, let's dance. One more couple right over there. That's it. Well, here we go! Salute your partner. Forward dance, swing on the right. Swing on the left. Hold the man proud and tall, and swing him round. And forward and back, swing on the right, now on the left. First lady and last gent, forward dance. Do-si-do. The next lady and the last gent, forward dance. Do-si-do. Now, then... All join hands and circle to the center. Grab right, then left. When you reach your partner, everybody swing to the right. Now to the left. Have...Have you seen who's here? Take her to your arms and swing her all around. Who's the stranger with Jane? I wouldn't know. How'd we get in here? Well, I don't know. Beautiful night, isn't it? Yes, it is. Just feel that air. Feel that air. Go on. What? Feel that air. It's like velvet, isn't it? What's the matter with you? Can we go, darling? So soon? Let's stay a little longer. Hello, ned. Surprised? Hardly. I expected you to show up sooner or later. You know each other? Yes, but ned's a very funny kind of fellow. Doesn't like to admit it. Your father's waiting for us. Wait a minute. I haven't thanked the lady for the dance. Thank you, milady. May I look forward to again being favored next time we meet? You're a lunatic. 'S crazy. Did ask you to feel the air? Why, yes. Who is? Someone I'd like to forget. But I told you, we ain't got no rooms left. I didn't ask you that. I asked you which was the best room in the house. Number 6, and there's about 18 boomers sleeping in it right now. But that's our room. I told you we couldn't hold nothing, miss. I told you, you had to sit in it to keep it. The town's overrun with boomers, and if you ain't there, they are. What's this about our room? I told you we couldn't hold nothing. I'd be glad to let you have my room, ma'am. Well, that's very kind of you. Thank you, but we couldn't put you out. Wouldn't be putting me out. Just a minute. What room do you think you have? Number 6, and you're very welcome to it. See here. I told you who was in number 6... About 18 boomers sleeping on the floor, 3 deep. That's all right. They'd be glad to do a favor for a lady. That's awfully generous of you, but I really don't know how to thank you. Not another word. Just leave it to me. Hey, what's going on here? Come on, you mavericks! On your feet! The land rush is on! Come on! They've fired the starting gun! Come on! 'S taking me home to his house. The soldiers are all bunched on the immigrant line, but on the other side of the creek, they begin thinning out to one soldier every 50 yards. Two. We can slip through there tonight and be on the inside, waiting for them. What about this "sooner" law? Once we've staked out a claim, they can't prove a thing. Well, what are we waiting for? We're waiting for the line to thin out so we can slip through. Bet $10. That's brand-new money. Where'd you get it, mister? Minted it myself this morning. Well, aces always beat kings. Whip, I just seen one of the fellas that took that Indian money off us. Yeah? You sure? 'S playing with a lot of new-minted money. Play that for me, will you? Sure. Where is? That little fellow over there with the piano. Say, do you know, I don't want to play in your yard? They don't want that tonight. Play it. Not tonight, brother. Play it. Sure, that's one of my favorites. Yeah, it would be. You know who that is? No. That's the Oklahoma kid. Handley. Tell that little squirt over by the piano I want to see him. Put it away, handley. Kid, I want to talk to you. Keep on playing. I said I want to talk to you. Well, go ahead and talk. My name's whip mccord. That mean anything to you? How's that? Mccord. Mccord, mccord, mccord.... I don't like it. Do you? I want that Indian money. Well, go and get it from the Indians. Kid, I'm giving you a break 'cause I'm pressed for time. Don't you raise that bottle at me! Give me that bottle! Go on. Get over there. Get over. That's a boy. Play, professor. Hi, sheriff. I'm glad you got here. What's it about, mccord? You looking for the man that held up the stagecoach and got that Indian money? Naturally. What's that got to do with it? That's him just left here. I called him on it, and started shooting. How'd you know him? How else would a man get new-minted money? 'S been spreading it all around the joint. That's right. We all seen him. Who was? The Oklahoma kid. The Oklahoma kid, yeah. Let me take a look at that silver. I'll show you. Let's compare watches, captain. Here's ned. Hey there! Well, how are you, judge? Get there first, ned. We will, and don't be too long coming to our city. Get it built first. It's almost time to sound the warning signal. Sound the attention. Good-bye, ned, and good luck to you. You're my good luck. Bye! Come on, ned. Starting gun goes off in 5 minutes, boys. Wait a minute, pop. Wait a minute. What's your best whiskey? Kentucky bourbon, 11 years old. I'll try some of your bar whiskey. Want to catch that stampede? Go ahead. I'll hold down the bar. Thanks. Have a drink on the house. Squad, ready. Squad, fire! Hello, young fella. Never got to thank you for the rooms. Don't mention it. Where's the bartender? Outside watching the rush, I suppose. It was a great sight, wasn't it? I don't know. I didn't see it. You didn't see it? No. I thought I'd have me a quiet little drink instead. What'll you have? I'll serve you. It's on the house. Here, try some of this uncut moonshine. Got some taste to it. Go ahead. Thanks. How come a strong, healthy young fellow like you isn't out there up to his neck in this land rush? Why? I'm doing all right. Those people are going out there to build a new empire. Fine. Let them have it. You mean to say you've got no feeling for the country, no pride in seeing a civilization carved out of a wilderness? What sort of an American are you? I like the country fine. As for civilization, I've got nothing in particular against it. I can take it or leave it alone. What sort of folks did you come from? The most god-fearing, law-abiding, land-grabbing, empire-building fellas you ever saw. Suckers for this land-rush stuff, too, but not for me. I crave a nice easygoing existence, and I've got it. I see. No responsibility. No ambition. None of this get-up- and-get-it stuff that regular folks have. Exactly, and that's why my folks and I have been on the outs for years. You seem like a very antisocial young man. But I'm not. I'm as social as a setter pup. I like all kinds of people, but I don't take to this itch for plowing up new empires, that's all. But why not? I'll tell you why not. Now, look. In the first place... The white people steal the land from the Indians, right? They get paid for it, don't they? Paid for it? Yeah. A measly $1.40 an acre, price agreed to at the point of a gun. Then the immigrants sweat and strain and break their hearts carving out a civilization. Fine. Great. Then when they get it all pretty and prosperous, along come the grafters and land-grabbers and politicians and with one hand skim off the cream and with the other, scoop up the gravy. Not for me. Listen. I learned this about human nature when I was about so high, and that is that the strong take away from the weak, and the smart take it away from the strong. I suppose you never heard of the law that protects people's rights and property. Yeah, I've heard of it. I've seen it work, too. Sometimes, it's all right. In the cities, maybe fine, but here, you can't trust it. This is the only law that I know that's worth a hoot in this part of the country. The only law. This is wasting time. Come on. Let's have a drink. Hands up. Hello, Abe. Hello, Sam. Howdy, judge. Will you kindly remove those irons, please, sir? Why, certainly. Excuse me, son. This young fellow a friend of yours? Well, not exactly. We're just having a drink together. 'S got some very original ideas about life. I wouldn't wonder. Just keep them up, son. Don't start any trouble. Well, what's up? I'm Abe Collins. Who? Abe Collins. Is? Yes. 'S the sheriff. Now, look here. You dropped some new-minted money last night in a Blackjack game, didn't you? That's right. What of it? Nothing, only it happens to be part of that Indian consignment stolen from the stage yesterday evening. Well, it seems like law won out, even out here. We've been waiting a long time to pick up this boy. Is that so? Well, 's an amiable thief. So pleasant about it all. Who is? We don't know his right name, but throughout the territory, 's known as the Oklahoma kid. All right, kid. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Lovely morning. Father, what's happened? Seems that our young friend is the Oklahoma kid. Whip, here they come. Sorry, gents. I'm afraid you're trespassing on private property. Sooners? No. We just got here ahead of you. That's all. We led the field all the way, nobody else in sight. We'll have you sited at the land office. Now keep your shirt on. There's no sense in starting any trouble when everything can be settled quiet and peaceful. The only way to settle this is for you to get off our land. Your land? Here's our claim stake sticking right up here in front of you. You won't get away with this. I think we will. We've already got a man halfway back to the claim office. You're licked, Mr. Kincaid, and you know it. Hey, what are you after? Nothing much. We just heard you were figuring on building a town here. That's all right with us. All we want's a part of it and the exclusive rights to any saloons or gambling houses the town might need. Who are you? Where are you from? Whip mccord from the panhandle. What's your proposition? You go right ahead and build your town and attract settlers. So you can take away their money at faro and roulette? Yeah, that's the idea. You take care of their virtues. I'll take care of their vices. That's simple, ain't it? We'll fight you through the courts first. You aren't going to do yourself any good in court. You can't start building until the title's cleared, and you know how long that'll take. Meanwhile, some other town will be years ahead of you. Anyway, why fight? What's a few hundred foot of business frontage to an empire builder like you, Mr. Kincaid? All right. Pick out your ground. Right here, and here's a waiver of right to protest under the sooner law, so that everything will be fair and square. Hey! All right, boys. 'S only a floater. Get on with your play. Shootings, killings, robberies, and a mighty orgy of drunkenness, gambling, and vice all directly traceable to mccord's influence. Why, owns our mayor, our sheriff, and half our deputies. Yes, they make arrests, just enough to save their faces, but we can't convict because, despite my efforts, juries are bribed and witnesses intimidated. I say we need a showdown. Either mccord and his crowd run this town or we do. It's time to find out. I know. I've been wondering how much longer this could go on, but we made a mistake in the first place in making a deal with him. Now, what do you suggest? I say we should form a vigilance committee. No, no. That would only be one mob fighting another. We represent law and order. We've got to take control away from mccord legally. We've seen these gamblers and criminals make our city the nesting place for all the scum of the west. We've seen vice and corruption flourish and our officials do nothing about it. We've seen murders committed in our streets and public places and the murderers go unpunished. We can't tolerate this condition any longer. It's up to you, men, as voters, to stop this lawlessness. I ask you to elect me mayor so I can clean out mccord and his gang of thieves and murderers. I ask you to elect my son sheriff. All right, boys, break it up. Mccord! Breaking up a few speeches isn't going to save you. In the end, I'll see that the law gets you, and it won't be just to run you out of town. It will be at the end of a rope. We ought to do something about Kincaid, whip. 'S likely to get up the vigilantes like they did in dodge city. We'll do something. We'll get him on the end of that rope, and it'll be in his own law-and-order fashion, too. What's the matter, Jose? You don't like music? You don't like the music? All right, come on. Come on over here with me. I'm going to sit down here. I'm going to sing to you. Come on. Ho ho ho. All right. You don't mind if I sing, do you? Hey, now. Once again, now. How's that? You like it? All right. Come on. Everything's all right. Come on. We're going to get a nice sleep? We're going to get a nice rest, aren't we? That's a good boy. Callate! Shut up. It's Pedro. It's all right. You get everything, Pedro? - Si, senor. - Everything. Here's the dinero, senor. Gracias, senor. Pedro... Pedro, saddle my horse. Si, senor. You go? Si, manuelita. You no stay for dinner? No, gracias. You come back soon? Yes, very soon. Manuelita, take care of these things for me, will you? Adios. - Adios. - Adios. Morning, friend. Where's the jailhouse in this town? Right up the street. You can't miss it. Glad to hear that. How's that? Is that where they're keeping old man Kincaid? Yep, smack-dab in the front cell upstairs where folks can stare at him. All right. Thanks. You're a stranger in town. That's right. Seems like I've seen your face someplace. Well, I wouldn't know that. I've been a lot of places. Hyah! Come on! Holy smoke! Holy smoke! Now, son, I wouldn't worry too much. Who was that? Why, it was the kid. Who, the kid? It couldn't be. Wouldn't dare. Why, i... I guess you're right, ned. I must have been mistaken. Now, about the trial. With judge hardwick on the bench, there's nothing to alarm us. Dad, you're covering up. It was him, wasn't it? Sheriff, the Oklahoma kid's in town! I knew it! I saw him myself! Where are you going, ned? I think I know where 'll be. Wait. Don't do anything you'll regret. What are you doing here? Hello, ma'am. Came here to see you and talk to you. You shouldn't be in Tulsa. The whole town is plastered with posters offering a reward for you. I saw them... every one an insult. A measly $500. Well, you'd better come inside before someone tries to collect it. Won't you come in? You're still as crazy as ever. Thank you, ma'am. I... Very pretty. This is aunt Maggie. How do you do, aunt Maggie? The hem got loose, and... I see. Well, excuse us, aunt Maggie? We'd like to be alone. There you are. Now you can stop blushing. Did you say you wanted to talk to me? Yes, I did. As a matter of fact, I want to talk to your father. Isn't here. I don't know where I can reach him. You could help me if you wanted to. They tell me that the candidate for mayor is in jail. Is that why you came? Yes, strangely enough, it is. I don't like to see anybody in jail. You can understand that, can't you? I never know whether to take you seriously or not. I'm absolutely on the level. I'd really like to help him. It's not going to hurt anything if you tell me what you know. Please. Well, they say killed a man, a Mr. bates. Let's not mind what they say. What does say? Says that bates sent for him. When arrived at bates' house, found him dead. A few moments later, mccord and some others of his crowd came in. They've sworn that Kincaid had the gun in his hand when they entered. Why? Because they want him out of the way. Thank heaven my father will be the judge. Then you don't think they'll be able to get away with anything? They most certainly won't. Well, that's all I wanted to know. 'Cause if you're satisfied... I mean, you and your father are satisfied the old man didn't do the killing. Of course didn't. 'S not that kind. My kind? Yes, your kind. Thank you, ma'am. Why are you making this your business, anyway? Because happens to be my father. Your father? Hey, hey, hey. Go out this way, through the back door. Here's a chance to get yourself 500. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Jane, I want to talk to you. What's the matter, ned? Where is? Who? Sorry, aunt Maggie. I'm looking for the Oklahoma kid. I don't know who you're talking about. Yes, you do. You remember him. Danced with you that night in cherokee city. Yes, I remember him, but... Well, 's here. In Tulsa? In this house. Why, it's ridiculous. Isn't. Jane, look at me. I told you isn't here. Don't you believe me? I'm sorry. Ned, why didn't you ever tell me that was your brother? How did you know that? I'd rather not say. Then was here! Yes, was. Why did you deny it? Because was your brother, and I wanted him to get away. Are you sure that's the only reason you wanted him to get away? Yes. Where did go? I don't know. Ned, why didn't you tell me about him? It's just that dad and I don't think of him as a member of the family anymore. Is that bad? Wasn't as a kid. We were great pals then. But as grew up, everything changed. Got so thought the law was meant for one thing... Just to be broken... So finally dad had to throw him out. Why are you so interested? I'm not. It's just that 's your brother and... Jane, you know how I feel about you. Of course I do. I would have spoken sooner, but I wanted to get myself established first. Please, ned, not now. Jane, will you marry me? Ned, let's not talk about it now. Come back later, tonight. You are upset about Jim, aren't you? Jim? That's the kid's name. Perhaps it is, ned. I don't know, but please go. All right. Think you ought to take him up on that. I thought I told you to go. And miss all that wonderful lying you did for me? No. I wasn't lying for you. Now you really are lying, like a gentleman. Then it's lucky there's one gentleman present. You mean I didn't thank you? Well, I do thank you. I really think you ought to grab ned off. Make a great catch. Sober, serious-minded, industrious... Law and order himself. Good-bye, ma'am. Where are you going? I'll be around. I'm going to give your father's justice a chance to work, but it had better work. We haven't got a case. I've known this fella hardwick for years. You can't get to him. Hasn't bothered us much so far. That was different. We were getting people off, not convicting them. It's easy to fake a prosecution, especially when the witnesses are fixed. Why not? We own the jury, don't we? It won't get to the jury. If we'd used some cleverness in framing this thing, we might have had a chance, but with the case we've got, hardwick will throw us out of court. Well, then, we'll get rid of him. Use sense, whip. I am. Regardless of hardwick, Kincaid's going to swing. We'll start a run on that bank of his, and when it goes down, we'll take it over. We'll get the rest of those upright citizens one way or another. When we end up, this will be my town, wide-open, with more money pouring in than you ever saw before. In the meantime, we've still got to worry about hardwick. Yeah. How long have you known him? 10 or 12 years. 'S from Kansas City. There's nothing on him. I've tried that before. Has got any relatives? Yeah, a brother. Feed merchant in Kansas City. All right. We'll get hardwick out of the way. You have the trial moved up a couple of days. I think I can do that. That'll give us Morgan for the judge. Doolin, get me a boy we can trust... Somebody that isn't known around here. All right, come on. Get moving. All right, write a letter to hardwick. We'll make it look as though it came from his brother. I'll have a friend of mine mail it from Kansas City. This is bad news, judge, very bad. I'm extremely sorry. Well, of course, I'll leave immediately. I'll catch this morning's stage for Kansas City. Yes, I suppose you must, but what about Kincaid? I'll have plenty of time to get to Kansas City and back before the trial. Watch over things while I'm gone, will you? Of course. All right, boys. Everybody up! It's on the house... A celebration! Here's to Mr. Ringo, the smartest lawyer west of Chicago! And the trial set up for tomorrow with judge Morgan presiding. Hooray for Mr. Ringo! This can't be true. I just received a postcard this morning from uncle Stephen. 'S not dying, and 's not in Kansas City. 'S in Montreal. You think him trick? Of course it is, to get father out of town. When did the stage leave? Maybe 4, 5 hours ago. Get my horse saddled, quick! Good morning, ma'am. Kind of a hot morning to be riding so fast. Please don't stop me. I've got to catch father. The trial... Just a minute. Get those words out one at a time so I can understand them. Yes, you should know. Somebody's tricked father with this letter. It must be mccord. Not a word of it's true. It's just to get him out of town. Why? Mccord owns judge Morgan, that's why. They've moved the trial up to tomorrow. Morgan will preside. And they'll railroad the old man. Unless I can bring father back in time. Look here, you go on, get back to town. Back to town? Get hold of the old man's lawyer. Show him that. Tell him 's got to delay that trial if you got to pull a trick out of the bottom of the bag. But father... I'll go after him, bring him back. I'm kind of handy at stopping stages. All right. I'm so glad you saw me. I see you more often than you know. I said I'd be around, didn't I? Hello! Hey, wake up in there! Hello in there! Hey, wake up! Who is it? What do you want? - Stage go by here? - Yeah. - How long ago? - About two hours. Put up the gun. I want a change of horse. I'm willing to pay for it. Which... Hyah! All right, boys. Throw them down. The rest of you can take it easy. All I want is judge hardwick. Come on. Well. You? Yep. Put them down, judge. This is no holdup. Well, what is it, then? This may surprise you, but right now I'm working for law and justice. Your brother isn't sick at all. Mccord sent you that note to get you out of town. How did you know about that note? - Your daughter told me. - My daughter? Yeah. She didn't like the looks of it, and I did a little investigating. Mccord has had the trial moved up, and judge Morgan is presiding. - Morgan? - Yeah. That sounds like him. What's your interest in this? My name is Jim Kincaid. Are you John Kincaid's son? Yeah. But this is wasting a lot of good time. Come on. Have you got another mount? No, but we can pick one up at a settler's cabin down the road. All right, boys, on your way. Hyah! Hyah! Handley, take the stand. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? You say that Mr. bates was alive when you left the house? Yes, sir. Showed us out. Ned tolley can tell you that. Saw bates come to the door and say good night to us. I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that... Overruled. Proceed. Mr. tolley saw bates see you out. Yes, sir. What did you do then? We walked on down toward the square. I happened to turn around just in time to see Mr. Kincaid go into the house. Then? Well, that kind of worried us. We knew Kincaid had it in for bates... I object, your honor, to the witness... Overruled. Proceed. So we went back. Just as I got to the door, I heard a shot. We busted in and found Mr. Kincaid standing in the center of the room with a gun in his hand and Mr. bates lying on the floor dead. What did you do then? Naturally, we looked to see if was dead. Was. We took the gun away from Kincaid and sent for the sheriff. Not ned... the old sheriff, hartley. Kincaid came up the steps to mccord and said to all of us... Well, anybody could tell you what said. I object, your honor, to the witness testifying that... Overruled. Proceed. Well, said, "I'm going to get you, mccord, "and I'm going to get bates, too. One way or another, I'm going to get you." So, gentlemen, if you think the defendant did shoot and kill Mr. bates, you can find him guilty of murder in the first degree. On the other hand, if you think did not kill him and there's any reasonable doubts in your mind, you'll find him not guilty. The jury will retire. Your honor, I don't think there's any need for the jury to retire. We can take a vote right here. I'm so glad you're back. Where's dad? Stopped at the bank to see Mr. Martin. Well, what's happened? Has the trial started? It's all over. They found him guilty. It was the worst kind of a farce. They'd hardly let Mr. Martin speak. Well, I guess I'll be moving along. Don't do anything foolish. It seems to me that's just what I've been doing, riding around trying to catch the law by the coattails. Perhaps dad can get a new trial. Perhaps can prove that this one was illegal. Perhaps, but you can't expect him to lean on any of these people. Jim, think of your father and how feels. 'S an honorable man. 'S lived with the law. Yes. I think 's very lucky to have a no-good son to see doesn't die by it. I don't think 'd get much satisfaction out of having your father, the judge, read blackstone at his burial. Hyah! Get them up. Over here. All right, out. Come on. Is that cell empty? Yeah. Now, where's my old man's cell? Who? - Kincaid. - Your father? Where's his cell? Upstairs, in front. Get in. John Kincaid? Hello! Here! Hello, pop. Jim! Come on, pop. I'm taking you out of this tin can. No, you're not. Come on, get into that coat. I don't need your help. Wrong again. If you're going to depend upon the law, you're going to wind up on the end of a rope. Hey! Go to the bank and get the sheriff. The kid is breaking Kincaid out of jail. And here's one for you... The kid is Kincaid's son! What's that? Yeah. Now, get going! I know you mean well, but there's an issue in this town you wouldn't understand... Law or anarchy. I represent law and order. You don't. You never have. I'm not here to argue right from wrong. Do I have to hit you over the head or carry you over my back? That's the only way you'll get me to go with you. If I let you take the law in your hands, it would be an admission of my guilt. You see, Jim, it isn't only my freedom that I'm fighting for. But they've got you framed! Sheriff, the kid's got the keys. Went upstairs to the old man's cell. Come on! Come on! So long, pop. Good luck, son. Locked the deputies in the cell and went upstairs to get Kincaid. What do you think? Kincaid is the kid's old man! Say, that makes it easy. That's a jailbreak. This time, we'll be the vigilantes. Men, come over here! Come in close! You all know the Oklahoma kid? Yeah! Well, I just heard that the Oklahoma kid is old man Kincaid's son. And what's more, the kid's in town right now, trying to break his old man out of jail! Old man Kincaid was convicted of a murder. A jury made up of you men said that should hang. Yes, of course should! Are you going to stand by and let an outlaw take a murderer out of jail? No! If the law won't stop him, we will! Right. And if the law won't hang Kincaid, then it's up to us! And if we get the Oklahoma kid, we'll hang him, too! Are you with me? What are we waiting for? Let's go! Go with them and keep them hot. Come on, boys, for old man Kincaid! Looks like a hanging party. Mccord gang's in the lead. Think this will fit him, boys? Let's go up and try it out on old man Kincaid. They're on their way to the jail. Come on, boys! Come on, where are those keys? Come on, boys! Here is! Where's the kid? I don't know. Was here, wasn't? Yes. Helping you to escape. Wanted me to go with him. That's all I wanted to know. Listen to me, in the name of the law! Shut up! Hello, Jane. Do you know where my old man is? 'S in there. Jim, they've killed him. The mob broke into the jail, and... Who was it? Mccord? No, his gang, but mccord wasn't there. Do you know who was there? There was doolin, curley, Indian Joe, and handley. Doolin, curley, Indian Joe, and handley. What are you going to do about it? I'm going to the territorial governor in the morning and insist put this town under marshal law. A little bit late for that. Then we'll go after the ringleaders and bring them to trial. You better do it fast if you want to get there ahead of me. Father stop him. Stop him! 'Ll be killed. You couldn't stop him now, Jane. I don't know as I want to. Come on, get over there. Over. Now, where's mccord? Ain't here. And curley, doolin, and handley? They ain't here either. Indian Joe? Where's mccord? I don't know, kid. Who did the hanging? I don't know, kid. It was mccord, wasn't it? Was in on it. I don't know, I tell you. I don't know. All right. Come on down here. Now, you can tell mccord and the rest of his gang, I'll be calling on them, too. Great bunch of quitting rats, the whole crowd of you. A couple of hundred men, and the kid walks in and picks off Indian Joe like it was a shooting gallery. We didn't have a chance, boss. Now, look, get out! The kid said was going to get us all, whip. Named every one of us. Are you turning yellow, too? No, but don't you think we ought to duck, at least till the law gets the kid? No. I'm staying here. This is my town, and nobody's going to run me out of it. The kid wants to shoot it out with me, I'll be here. How do we stand legally? Just like I told you, you weren't there. You're all right unless somebody can prove you started it. They can't prove that unless somebody says something. No. There ain't nobody gonna say nothing. But the boys here are not in such a good spot. There was a big crowd there, and some of the citizens must have recognized them. I'm going to hit the trail. Might be best if they all did. I don't want any part of that kid. I'm with doolin. I think we better go. - All right. - Go ahead, run out. If anybody talks, you won't have to worry about the kid. How far is it to burden? That's over the Kansas line about 30 miles. You figuring on getting there tonight? How many horses you got? None. Just a mule, and 's lame. Go on. You two better get out of here. Go on. Go. Where's doolin and handley? How should I know? You were in on the hanging, weren't you? No. Give me a chance, kid. I'll give you the same chance I gave Indian Joe. Go on, reach for it. Well, if you don't reach for it, I can't shoot you. What'll it be? Whiskey. Right. Come out and get me, kid! Aha! I didn't do it, kid. I didn't...It was mccord. Mccord...Water... It was mc... It was mccord... First Indian Joe... Then curley. The list dispatched from Kansas City simply says they found handley's body in the freight yards with the neck broken. Yeah, but, judge, you know as well as I do, the kid got him just the same as got curley and Indian Joe. Yes, I know. And one of these days we'll hear that doolin has gone to his reward... Whatever that may amount to... And then we'll chalk up another for the kid. Yes, it's a puzzle to know how to feel. A man's torn. One side of him says it's a frightful thing for a lad to be piling up such a record of bloodshed, and the other side of him says, "go get him, kid. Get doolin next." If only we could get evidence against mccord and bring him to trial. Martin, you know, that ned has worked as hard as any man possibly could these past few weeks. It's impossible to get evidence. The mccord gang is a closed corporation of closed mouths. If we don't hurry up, the kid won't leave anybody for us to get evidence against. Jim. Hello, Jane. Is your father in? 'S inside with Mr. Martin. I've got something that'll interest him. Jim, you shouldn't come here. Do you realize there's a price on your head? Yeah, yeah. Look, I've got doolin outside. - Doolin? - Dead or alive? A little bit of each. But I think may be revived enough to bring his voice back. What did you get out of him? The whole story, and I don't think I'd like to hear it again, so I'll leave him in your hands. Take doolin down to the jail with ned. I'll be right down. Well, in that case, I'll be going, too. Jim, what are you going to do? I've got a date with mccord. Son, I know just how you feel. In that case, you won't hold me up with a lot of talk, will you? Haven't you done enough? I haven't done anything, except kill a lot of coyotes in self-defense, if you want to put it in law talk. Please wait. It's no use, Jane. Would it mean anything to you if I asked you not to go? Don't talk like that. You and ned are... I love you, Jim. You don't know what you're saying. I'm no kind of a man a woman could tie her bonnet to. Ned is. Women are crazy. That's why they fall in love with the wrong men. But they do. Now will you stay? No, no. I've started a job, Jane. I've got to finish it. It's a small point of honor that maybe a woman wouldn't understand. All right, Jim. I'll try to understand. There's only one thing I want, really, and that is for you to come back safely. Give me some of that water, will you? Take it easy, doolin. Tell me one more thing, then you can have a drink. I'll tell you everything, only give me a drink of water... Mccord responsible for that lynching or not? Water, please. Mccord responsible for that lynching?! Yes, of course was. Was behind the whole thing. Excited the boys to do it. That's all you need, ned. Here's our witness. Give him a drink. I'm going down and arrest mccord. Water. Whip, I saw the kid. Brought doolin into town. 'Ll be coming here next. All right, fine. I'll be glad to see him. Now, you two boys go outside, and when the kid shows up, make sure you draw first. Make sure your aim is good. Leave it to us, whip. We'll watch him. Mccord, you're under arrest. Get your hands up and walk toward me. Look out, kid. Good work, ned. Good work. Yeah. We make a good team when we're working on the same side. Now, don't talk anymore. You're not hurt much. I'll go and scare up a sawbones. Come on. No, wait. I must tell you now. I wrote the governor, said you'd been working on the side of the law, asked him for a pardon for... Never mind that. You'll be all right. Just get up here, and I'll get you. I'll get you. Remember when we were kids, you fell out of the apple tree? I had to carry you home that time. Yeah, sure, ned. I remember. One good turn deserves another. Come on, now. Easy. I'll get you home. I'm sorry, ned. We should have gotten together sooner. Where are you going, Jim? Chasing the moon. I hear there's a lot of new territory out Arizona way. Oklahoma's practically new. Couldn't you just stay here? No, I don't like the country around here. Why, it's beautiful country. I know the scenery's all right, except those placards. Every time I look at one of those $500 insults, I get madder and madder. Get around! But they're coming down. Father says it. Down or not, I'd always remember where they'd been. I understand. A new country, a new leaf. Me, turn over a new leaf? I'd have to turn over a whole public library. Well, after you've done all that, you think you'll ever, ever be back this way again? Well, maybe, maybe not. It all depends on the way things turn out. Well, good-bye, Jim. Good-bye. Jim, is Arizona an awfully big place? Yeah, yeah. So they tell me. Then I'll have a hard time finding you, won't I? Look here, Jane, you don't want to let yourself... I just mean if you're empire-building, it would save time... Who said anything about empire-building? I just mean it's a difficult thing to do by yourself. For an empire, you've got to have people. For people, you've got to have children, and for children... By authority as judge in the crying need of this situation... Just a minute, judge, you... Jane, do you take this man to be your... Yes, I do, dad. Yes. Just a minute... Jim, do you take this girl to be your... You don't want to get yourself into this. Takes me, father. Whether likes it or not. Very well, then. I pronounce you... Hold that hat. Man and wife.
