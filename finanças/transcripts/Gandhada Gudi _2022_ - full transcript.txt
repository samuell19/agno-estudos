A small boy, in search of a rare flower was seen roaming the forests in the cinema 'Bettada Hoovu' The first memory of Appu for me... Was that. Right from the time he was six months old, he had been on screen. Even before I entered his life as his life companion... Cinema was in his life. Even before he saw the world, the world saw Puneeth! Appu! Appu! Appu! Appu! Puneeth grew up to become a youth icon for the whole of Karnataka, but for his fans he was their beloved Appu. A rare hero loved by all! Appu! Appu! Appu! Appu! The love that was showered by the state and people is what he always longed to repay. It was then that he started... A new journey! This is a land full of wonders, to be born in this Sandalwood shrine is a blessing for me. To share these wonders with the world I roamed the wilderness over the last two decades and made wildlife films That I met Puneeth through these films was indeed my luck When Puneeth set out to explore his land, he called upon me as his companion. While he was exploring unseen Karnataka I was exploring what it meant to be a true hero. This was Puneethâ€™s long awaited dream A journey he had never embarked onâ€¦ What he left us with... Is this memorable last story! Our journey started exactly a year before he left us. That very same day. Empty road! Dense forest all around us. In an open jeep, when I started off with a superstar many adventures lurk! But first, to fulfil Puneeth's childhood dream... 'A hunt' Because we are entering the forest, different places have different customs. In this forest, there is a Goddess called Maastiamma. Okay! We will first head there, offer her our prayers and then proceed... these customs have been followed since thousands of years, there must be some truth, some reason behind it. So respecting them is our first duty. Definitely! The customs of people who stay here. In a way, the reason this forests are so beautifully preserved, is because of Gods. Yes, very true! The customs! She is Maastiamma, the Goddess of this forest... (A dialogue from Dr. Rajkumar's movie Gandhada Gudi). With this Mother's protection, it is said that no harm will befall us. (A dialogue from Dr. Rajkumar's movie Gandhada Gudi). Generally like this, we are travelling in an open jeep, but is it safe? Won't there be any trouble? 20 years ago, my journey started... as a photographer, Right here. Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. Once upon a time, what was the hunting grounds of the Maharajas of Mysore, Nagarahole... is now a world famous Tiger reserve! Our state's prideâ€¦ To fulfil Puneeth childhood desire of seeing elephants and tigers, this is the perfect place. I have two dreamsâ€¦ One is to see a tiger and the other is to see an elephant! We somehow have to encounter some wild animal soon. In our forest, we will definitely see, don't worry... I have confidence! These! They always move in group, right? Yes, yes. But what expressions! So, these monkeys are called Langurs, they mostly feed on leaves. ...leaf eating Unlike our other regular monkeys, they a eat lot of things. Coconuts, bananas... If this makes a sound and gives a warning, definitely there is a tiger or something around. They watch... And then they give a signal! Oh! Nice! For all the deer, this is a huge help! For them also, what entertainment, to simply watch! Also, it is said in a forest, for every one tiger we spot.. ...four tigers would have spotted us without our knowledge. Which means... We are in their zoo! We are in their zoo! Correct! Did you hear that sound? Can you hear that sound? That... Is a warning call, mostly there is a leopard or tiger nearby. We mostly always get to see only deers. So, which is the next place we're going to? There is a waterhole there. In summer, water dries up everywhere! They come to the waterholes. So elephants also frequent there? Yes, elephants too come there. Let's go there and wait for a while. Okay. People think! Wildlife photographers... Must have a lot of fun. It is surely fun, but many times we just have to sit and wait like this, that's all. We sit and keep waiting. For a minute's footage... For that, bare minimum, around... 15 days worth of shooting would have happened, minimum! Wow! in cinemas it will take around one and a half days. One and a half days! Wow! In cinema, you need around one and a half days! Yes, yes! Earlier, in about... 25-30 days, a movie would get done, in 60 days it would be done, nowadays it goes up to 100 days. Oh! 100 days! But those 100 days may be split over the period of a year, or may get done within six months. We spend 6-7 months and make a movie and that is shown as a 2 or 2 hours 15 minutes movie, in those 2 hours 15 minutes people decide if the film is good or not. To tell you the truth, your work needs a lot of patience! It's very difficult! Yes! Actually, you said we will be waiting, but this is a lot of waiting! Shall we leave? Yes, this is a truly difficult job! We will go wait somewhere else. - Yes! Elephant! Oh! My! Wow! So, about elephants, I remember an episode. When I was a small boy, in the movie Bhakta Prahlada, Hiranyakashpu was my dad. So there is a sequence of elephants attacking me.. I would have been put in prison, so, about 10-15 elephants, come chasing me.. When they were running towards me, Around 8 times the elephants were sent again and again, Due to fear, I used to get up and run away. Now, real wild elephantâ€¦ I mean, wild elephant in a dense forest, We are now standing here... and watching! Super! When it comes to an elephant, we have to be most careful! In the forest. Because... A tiger rarely attacks us or even a leopard, it is very less. Bears and Elephants, we have to be very careful about If an elephant comes near us, carefully from far... From as far as possible, respecting it's space, if we give it space, then there is no problem. It's when we go near them, play pranks, those are the times... Elephants attacks happen at such times. Somebody, considering it to be Ganesha, went to give banana to the elephant! Will the elephant spare him? There, look there... There! Wow! Oh my God!! My first experience! It's Majestic!! It has a royal way about it! Wild dogs... Are extremely ferocious animals! These wild dogs which always hunt in a group, They can devour an entire deer in just a few minutes. Tiger v/s Wild dogsâ€¦ What may happen! So, how was it seeing your first tiger? Amazing! Wow! Good experience.. Great experience! Beautiful! It's amazing! Lovely place! What a beautiful place! My most favourite cinema, your father's Gandhada Gudi! Gandhada Gudi! This is where it was shot. Is that so? Am happy that you mentioned it when I first met you! Gandhada Gudi has inspired a lot of people, a lot of officers, many people working in the forest department, were inspired by the movie and joined the department It was an amazing movie, I feel proud of it. In fact, you told me another thing about the movie. In India... For the first time ever! About forest department and the forests, that was the first cinema to be made! The concept of conservation that we speak about today, in those days, the gift that it has given, according to me, there is no other comparison. Yes! There is that song itself.. The place where I live is the Sandalwood shrine! The lyrics too are equally wonderful in it. My elder brother too did Part 2 of that movie, my father too did a guest appearance, in the first scene of that film. I am very happy, nice, beautiful place, unforgettable! When it came to naming our journey, Puneeth and I had only one answer! 50 years ago, the glory of our state which was made known to the world by that movie, to that movie, this was our gift of love! I beg you with folded hands, (Dr. Rajkumar's dialogue from Gandhada Gudi -1973) I will fall at your feet and ask you! (Dr. Rajkumar's dialogue from Gandhada Gudi -1973) Save the forest, save the animals, save this Sandalwood shrine! If you want... If you want sacrifice me! Gandhada Gudi When we spoke of Gandhada Gudi, what Puneeth remembered was the village he spent his childhood in and his father's birthplace, the first place where he was introduced to nature... Gajanur. My father was from Gajanur and my mother was from Saligrama. So both of them came from... an agricultural background. Perhaps it was the way he grew up, he loved his village immensely, so every year, he would bring us and make us stay for a month or two... But when we went there, the way we used to live was very different, it used to be extremely good. Because of that, they all have become... like lessons that we have learnt. This is the place that we love a lot. I will show you another beautiful place where my dad used to visit all the time. This is that banyan tree! How old could this be? To the best of my knowledge, aboutâ€¦ 250 years or more, I think! Wow! According to our family... This was my... My grandfather's first property.. This was my father's most favourite place in Gajanur! The banyan tree! Because he really liked this place, this tree... he used to come here often, he used to meditate for 30 to 45 minutes. if he had a kerchief in his hand, he would wrap it and on this very rock, he would sleep for 30 to 45 minutes, and he used to even get the food brought here and eat. He was very fond of nature, he loves trees, he loves nature. It's a beautiful please, isn't it? It's super! Thanks Puneeth. You're welcome!! Come, now I will show you the house where my father was born. Itâ€™s your memoriesâ€¦ This is our village home, - Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! our Gajanuru home. - Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! The birthplace of my dad. The birthplace of my dad. - The desire to look at you, The desire to look at you, Is all thatâ€™s filled in meâ€¦ Itâ€™s in me! Itâ€™s your memoriesâ€¦ Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! The desire to look at you, Is all thatâ€™s filled in meâ€¦ Itâ€™s in me! I was baked in the cool breezeâ€¦ - Loneliness made me suffer! One of India's greatest actors Dr. Rajkumar - Loneliness made me suffer! acted in more than 200 movies. - I was baked in the cool breezeâ€¦ Loneliness made me suffer! Every atom of Dr. Rajkumar was filled with love for his state and language, - In broad daylight, sullen and weathered! for an entire generation, - In darknessâ€¦ he was an inspiring role model. - I seek you and am in grief! The whole day, itâ€™s youâ€¦ Dr. Rajkumar who made the whole world take notice of us, - That I await! Both in reel life and real life, - Itâ€™s your memoriesâ€¦ Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! lived in the same virtuous way, like a saint. - Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! The desire to look at you, Is all thatâ€™s filled in meâ€¦ Itâ€™s in me! Separated from the shoreâ€¦ Just like the banyan tree that has grown over generations, - I became a wandering cloud! art and simplicity have been preserved... - Separated from the shoreâ€¦ By this family. I became a wandering cloud! In Puneeth's every step, what I could see was that! - I melt and slide to the earthâ€¦ I flow and seek the oceansâ€¦ That simplicity! - I flow and seek the oceansâ€¦ That same love for art. I am fated to live thus... Itâ€™s your memoriesâ€¦ Thatâ€™s in my heart, every single day! The desire to look at you, Is all thatâ€™s filled in meâ€¦ Itâ€™s in me! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! I mean... My father loved Gajanuru a lot, One, because it was his birthplace, it might be the forest surrounding this place, the nature here, the agricultural activities that is indulged in here, he loved all of these. All said and done, in one circumstance, you all know about it, a bitter incident happened in our family, that was my father getting kidnapped. It happened from our village only. Even though that pain is still in us somewhere, in that situation, it might be the people living here, and the fans that my father had, my father used to address them as 'Gods'. the people of Karnataka, the people of our state, the people of our nation, everyone prayed a lot, showered exceptional love and prayed for him and all of them stood behind us. So that strength brought back my father, added to it, being able to spend 106-108 days there, definitely the reason behind it is the love that he had for nature, it might be the experience of roaming around in these forests, all these... I believe were what made a difference! Now we're headed towards are the forest where Dr. Rajkumar might have walked those 108 days. Undaunted by the sun, rain and the winds, protecting these forests, are the foot soldiers of our forest department. I am the guard! Forests and jungles, I do protect! I am the one who is alert! For the array of mountains and hillsâ€¦ My name is Military Mahadeva, I belong to the Soliga tribe. I was born in the forest and I grew up in the forest. The shores of the oceanâ€¦ The air, land and water, I do protectâ€¦ To preserve the forests for our tomorrow, Undefeated, I keep guarding! Roaming all round... Alerting one and all! The forests, I do protect and maintain! I guard the forestsâ€¦ For our tomorrow! For our forestsâ€¦ Day and night, I will guard keep guarding! For our forestsâ€¦ My life itself, I will pledge! For our tomorrow... I am a comrade of this forest! For our future generations! I am the soldier who protects all the forests! My name is Rangamma and I am working as a forest watcher. I was born and brought up here and we wish to save our forests. For our tomorrowâ€¦ For future generationsâ€¦ Such a huge mountain exists right next to my village, I never knew about this, that too as close as 20-25 kms! What an amazing place! All these forests, perhaps my father too may have walked... Is it fine that you alone, patrol in the jungle at night times? Yes sir. You are used to it. Yes sir, I am used to it. - Super! Since we are born and brought up in the forest, for us it is a habit sir. You go for patrolling in the forest, approximately at what time did you go? We leave very early in the morning, we return by afternoon or much later in the evening sir. So it's like, you keep rations for yourself. Yes sir, it is given by the department itself, we take what we need for the afternoon with us, wherever there is water, we sit there and have lunch and again continue patrolling and return to the camp by evening. Is it possible for us to go with them too? Can we also come with you in the morning? Yes sir, let's go sir. Will you keep us safe? A small team, day and night, they walk hundreds of kilometres, they guard our air, water and land. Their hard work is for... Our tomorrow! What do the poachers steal here? They steal... Deer, and teak wood tree, rose wood tree... All these. See, earlier they used to hunt deer meat, after patrolling began, after the Anti-Poaching Camps started, everything has completely stopped in this area. Because that much meat, What we call as wild meat! Yesâ€¦ Bush meat. What we call Bush meet... It is not there anymore. But even now, in the village areas they still hunt a little, because of that too, we might face issues later. Protecting the animals is very good, that's why, The poaching camp too has been set up. - See... Everyone here is so fit and they are walking so well. You are very healthy, how much do you walk per day? Daily... 20 to 25 kilometres and sometimes we even do even 30 km. - Beyond everything... Tirelessly... We go for patrollling! It's us we go... It is us! What sir?! Shall we sit here? Nice program... Walk, talk and eat! You are a huge fan of Puneeth, I believe! Yes sir, huge! Is that so madam? Yes sir. Thank you, thank you! Which movies have you watched? I have seen Abhi, Maurya... I have seen Doddamane Huduga! Wow! OK! Almost all your movies I have watched. Thank you, thank you! It's very nice sir, the way you act and dance... Very, very good sir. Thank you, thank you. The Kannadada Kotyadhipathi program that you conduct, - ('Who wants to be a millionaire' Kannada version) I like that program a lot sir, I too am trying for that sir, will you give me a chance sir? To get a chance, the show is yet to start But why go there, let's do one thingâ€¦ Right here, in a small way, let's play a game like Kotyadhipathi, Is that okay? Okay sir. My first question isâ€¦ Which was the first movie Dr. Rajkumar acted in? Option one: Bedara Kannappa Option two: Bangaarada Manushya Option three: Giri Kanye Option four: Srinivasa Kalyana Option one sir. Bedara Kannappa. - Bedara Kannappa. Right answer! Do you watch movies? Yes sir. Do you watch a lot? Yes! A lot sir. Very good! Okay! Okay! Now! We have come to your forest, right? Now why don't you ask him a question about the forest. A question for the person who questions? And that too about the forest! Let me try, okay! Ask me. How many tigers are there in our state sir? Options? 50.. 100.. 500, 1000! 50, 100... - Approximately. 500, 1000â€¦ Approximately! - Approximately. Yesâ€¦ Approximately! Approximately... Is it 500? Am I correct? - Yes! Having brought you to the forest, it's paid off! I have spoken with many accomplished people, right? The whole of Karnataka is our state, because it's our district, there is a point to be noted here, 'The Land of Tigers' is what Chamarajanagara is called. Yes sir. I have been told I have been told to say it! I am also very proud, Am very happy. The air, land and water, are what is in play here! Beyond all this, tirelessly... We go patrollingâ€¦ It is us! Puneeth is so simple and down to earth, is known to everyone. It is us! Still, But to bring such a big superstar to the forest, I still had my own fears. For our forestsâ€¦ Day and night, we keep guarding! Even in a forest like this with no facilities, - For the forests! watching him enjoy like a small child, - I will pledge my very life! I understoodâ€¦ - For the forests! Our hero is a hero, wherever he is! - For our tomorrow! I am the soldier guarding the forests! For our tomorrow... For the forests! For our tomorrow! For the future generations! Control calling Punajanur! Control calling Punajanur! Control on the line sir. Elephants have strayed into the farm, have a look. I repeat! Elephants have strayed into the farm, have a look! Received Why have we left the forest and come here? We have got information that elephants have come here, that's why we're here. Elephants? Leaving the forest the elephants come here to eat the crops, so to prevent damage to the crops, they come here and drive them away. First they light a fire on their path, If it does not work, they call us... the elephants are not leaving, please come sir, they say... then we come here and burst crackers, and we howl and scream and drive them away. Sir! I think there are elephants here, please stay here. (Forest guards shouting and making noises.) (Forest guards shouting and making noises.) Sir, the elephant has gone, Let's go, come on Oh!.. Trusting you we have come here, Yes sir.. Such cases must be happening here regularly, right? Elephants entering the fields and destroying crops, etc. In certain places there are a lot of problems, So much that they come daily and people have died too. It's really very, very common! We had that too, In Gajanur side, But not so frequently, Why is it that they come to certain places regularly? In some places what would have happened is that the forest would have been destroyed. I mean, in recent times. So the elephant remembers it as a forest. As it is it's home, it tries to get back to it again and again, In those times it becomes extremely difficult, What do they do in such times, to those elephants? In such times they only have two options, one is to keep driving them away, at times it won't be possible, because people die, people won't keep quiet, Yes, yes, yes! they have to be captured, The process of capturing it, I have seen it, I will show you it is very disheartening, capturing such a huge elephant! (Muffled dialogues while capturing the elephant.) (Muffled dialogues while capturing the elephant.) I have absolutely no knowledge, about all these things The thing is that I am used to seeing elephants in temples and training camps behind all this there is so much of effort and such cruelty to it, Its really sad! At least... These captured elephants are kept in good camps and well taken care of by our department officers. So somewhere, they might not be free, But at least they won't be killed they are captured and are taken good care of. I would like to see the camp, we have to go there. On the way back, it falls enroute, while going back, we will see it and go. Mr. Siddha, thank you so much, for showing us your forest, taking us there... Okay! What madam? Thank you! Thank you madam! Thank you sir! The captured elephants are put in a wooden crawl for a few months, and are trained. They treat these elephants lovingly like their own kids our mahouts. For problems created by humans, humans are the solution. Amogh... I would not like to call it as a cage, the wooden... the crawl they are locked in, when we see all that! We used to think it was a showpiece! but is there no other solution at all? If the elephants could be brought and trained? Is this the only way? What they are doing now is... â€˜Elephant corridorsâ€™ are being declared everywhere. The routes taken by the elephants before, that were turned into fields and farms, Are now being bought again and left like forests. so they will start going back to the routes they used to take. These elephantsâ€¦ Do they remember the paths they have walked on? I always believe that, you knowâ€¦ As it is said in in Jurassic Park, 'Nature will find its way.' Like that, it will always come back, is my not only my strong opinion, but it is the reality too! Really? If you still don't believe, to show you just how quickly nature recovers, we will go to a placeâ€¦ Jurasic Park? Our Jurassic Park! This is a world full of secretsâ€¦ The answer for many wonders of nature, is here... Thisâ€¦ Is our unseen coast! Have you got me here to witness some different birds... That too near the sea? Of course, now we have seen birds &amp; animals on the land, but now let's see the creatures below the water. Oh! Underwaterâ€¦ Diving! (In unison) This is Mariam, our diving instructor. - Hi Mariam. Hi! Hi! So she is going to take us down. Okay! Okay! Basically where we are going today is called Netrani islands, Yes! Right? Netrani. If you see.. it actually looks like a heart! I'd always heard about this place, that there were a lot of diving sites across here. I know in India we have many, Yeah! but we are extremely proud it's in Karnataka. Netrani used to be a bomb practice site of The Indian Navy. But now due to the efforts of environmentalists, in some places they have stopped all that! So wherever this bomb practice has been stopped... In all those places, be they corals or marine life, they have all bounced back very well! If we can see all types of fishes right here, we too feel kind of happy Yes! I hope there's no... Pardon? fish which attacks us!? Just joking! The only thing that attacks anything is us! Humans! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Scuba diving is an adventure sport. Which involves a lot of training and safety measures. For Puneeth who did fights, dance and stunts himself, this was a new challenge! After passing the exam and obtaining the license, for this unseen world, we were ready! We know more about the moon than about our oceans. On the earth, much before plants, trees, animals and birds evolved... Life started in the oceans. More than half of the oxygen that we breathe, comes from the oceans... This is our first home! The seven seas have become close, beckoning you and me... The invitation of this endless ocean... Has lured you and me! Joining the oceans, sliding from the clouds... Again the thirst to join the ocean! This is the school of life! There lies the game of life! There lies the origin for the web of lifeâ€¦ There lie our very rootsâ€¦ There lies our origin, itâ€™s there that we must end! Itâ€™s there that our birth is, its also our comfort. The shores where the babble began... To join our ocean town... The waves have come calling! There lies the origin for the web of lifeâ€¦ There lie our very rootsâ€¦ What a wonderful place! Beautiful! Felt so happy... As I was telling you earlier... Karwar, Malpe, Gokarna... In all places nearby these, we shot 'Ondu Muttina Kathe' the underwater shoot was only done in the Maldivesâ€¦ Perhaps in those days, if we had this technology with usâ€¦ If these advancements and diving were with us itself, my father would have been so happy, to dive in these oceans, Shankar Nag too! Back then we had no idea that we could do it here! But see, we saw such beautiful fish, but due to these fishing nets, plastic and all, they are all getting stuck in them and so many fish are dying. Everyday, regularly! And if we continue using plastic thus we see such a lot of plastic on the beach! By 2050, the oceans will have more plastic than fish inside, I believe! Such a day will will come too, if we continue in this way! However much we try to avoid plastic, to an extent it may reduceâ€¦ That's why today I wish to say something in a crisp way! Today, we went in like heroes and cleared some of the plastic. Okay? In a similar way, let's all become heroes! To the extent possible, let's reduce the usage of plastic! When we throw the plastic, let's do so in their designated bins! And as much as possible let us recycle the bottles and the such... Let's use plastic as less as possible! The plastic on this earth, the sooner we eradicate it, the better it is for us... The waves have come calling! There lies the origin for the web of lifeâ€¦ The reason the ocean we just swam in is so abundant is the rivers that flow into it. While these rivers originate and flow through the Western Ghats they create spectacular valleys and world famous waterfalls. After being born as a human, what all have you seen? (Puneeth stating Dr. Rajkumar's famous song from Jeevana Chaithra) Till you die, worldly issues will bogg you down! We can't hoard anything in this vehicle of life, While alive, once you must see Jog falls! It brings chills down the spine! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! In your father's song, I saw this for the first time! Like you said, in future... Even if I come back a thousand times, this feeling will remain! Seperated from the oceans... Becoming a floating cloud, Melting and pouring down on the earth... These rains... That rainforests are created because of this rain. Oceans to rivers, rivers to oceans... This is the story of life! To camp in the midst of nature, atleast for a day was Puneeth's wish. It's monsoon time Malenadu! One of the regions that recieves the highest rainfall in the world is our Malenadu. Our Western Ghats which are older than the Himalayas, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The different species of plants, trees, animals and birds found in this heaven are found nowhere else in the world! So... Between rainforests and the other forests we see generally, what is the difference? See.. The forests we saw in Nagarhole are dry deciduous forests. There, in winter and summer months, the leaves fall from the treesâ€¦ These are evergreen forests, here throughout the year, the vegetations remains the same. Also, the number of species we see there, if we can see ten types of animals there, here in the same small area we'll see hundred types of animals. What are the hundred other animals we can see here? Here we can find leopards, what we call as flying squirrels, mongoose, scorpions and also frogs... We encounter many such animals. Amoghâ€¦ What is that sound? A whirring sound? I don't know from below or... It might be a snake! Mostly! A snake!? There are about 70 types of snakes here, it must be one of them... In the forest, snakes will be here, I know that! Even if we encounter a leopard, it's fineâ€¦ But the snake is something... I am extremely scared of! That too about 70 types? But here it's fine. You will be safe, no need to worry! Trusting you I have come here! I have upcoming shoots in Bangalore! Three films are being shotâ€¦ My wife and children are at home waiting, we will go back safely, right? Amoghâ€¦ I have spent time in such a tent, I have slept a night in the tent. See for example, you have gone and camped so many times. So In my experience, I always get impressed seeing tents, seeing this in movies, in adventure movies. Butâ€¦ I have actually spent a night in the tent! But if you get to know where, you will laugh! So you have camped in a tent before? Yes, I haveâ€¦ It was in the garden of my own house! It was just thatâ€¦. I was crazy about sleeping in a tent! To go outside and camp, I did not have the habit I also did not have friends who indulgedâ€¦ So I had camped in my garden, this is my first time in such an atmosphere. To experience these sounds, you need to pay in a 5 star hotel, but here, we are getting it for free! The atmosphere is set, is there any arrangement for food? Food is also specialâ€¦ The idea is to dine like we do in a 5 star hotel. So, I will give you the menu options. Stew &amp; rice, pongal, bisibelebath, Upma... This is my first experience camping in the forest, I don't know how will be! Okayâ€¦ Good night! The freshest water we can drink! Isn't it! - Yeah! Won't be polluted anywhere on the top. Spring. Mineral water. So mineral waterâ€¦ Water with real minerals in it. Since morning we have camped, we drank water. We ran for about 4-5 kilometres. But Amogh is nowhere around, I don't what he's gone in search of... Let's wait! Amogh, what are you searching for? Come, I'll show you! It's there... What's there? Come I'll show you... Something special! There's a frog, come and see, a special frog! You got me this far to show a frog? This is just like you, this frog dancesâ€¦ This is a dancing frog! Dancing frog?! I dance for my livelihood, but why does this dance? See, due to the sound of this running water, it cannot call out to the female and show off that it is here, because the female won't be able to hear... So it has to raise it's leg and dance and show the female "I am here! I am here!" Soâ€¦ In evolution, all males are in the same spot! If they want a female, they must dance! Itâ€™s a Pit Viper. Malabar Pit Viper. See there... Is he... Poisonous? Yeah! It is one of the venomous snakes found in the Western Ghats. But people won't die, as in, no one has died from it's bite! It's venom is not that potent! There is no anti-venom for itâ€¦ So we have to be careful! Actually, the people who work in the fields nearby... Won't they face any issues? They probably might... - No, they will have an idea. be knowing about this. - They'll know. But still, how do we safeguard ourselves from this? We should not get bitten, that's all! - Yeah, that's great advice! Come, come! You lead. When it comes to snakes, what I remember is a small storyâ€¦ It was probably when I was 6-7 years old, In the shooting of the movie 'Bhakta Prahalada' I was Prahlada... So, I will be sitting on a slab, When I am sitting on the slab surrounding my neck, was a snake! In that young age, when the snake was wrapped around meâ€¦ The way it breathed is still resonating in my ears! Since then... I am somewhat scared when I see a snake. In the movies or on the TV, if I see a snake in any program... I just switch it off! But now, since morning... I have seen around two snakes. Somehow I feel my fear has come down by 30% becauseâ€¦ I got some knowledge about it. I'm very thankful to Amogh... That's because Amogh brought me here... He made me roam around a lot. Thus since morning as I have seen two snakes and after he spoke about them, If we don't trouble it, it won't do anything to us, is what I feel! But my fear has not totally gone, but atleast 30% I am more confident, I have improved! I have gained some awareness about it. I am happy! I feel confident and I feel happy about myself! Yes Gowri. Yeah! Sureâ€¦ Done, done, done! Okay! One of my friends had called, A snake has entered in a house nearby. They will rescue it, which means, they will catch it from the house and release it in the forest, it will be very interesting to watch, if you agree we can go. We will go! Anyway I have seen 2-3 snakes in the forest and am used to them! I also have gained courage now! Which snake is it? It is a King Cobra! King Cobra? The world's largests venomous snake? Yes, yes. Oh! Okay! Is it safe? No problem, right? No, no, no issue at all! Firstly, this snake has killed very few people... and my friend Gowri Shankar has been researching on these snakes for years and has rescued many snakes like this and released them. So definitely we will be safe.. Hey! Amogha... Hey! Gowri... Gowri Shankar. Hi! Goodâ€¦ Come, come quickly! There is a snake right here! You too have come at the right time. Let's go rescue it. Okay, let's go. We'll keep our distance! It's fine! Come, come! It's behind this, these logs that have been kept, Come! Oh! My God! Thank you. Thatâ€™s great.. Take this.. Okay... So... Wait! Prashanth... Please come.. Puneeth.. See how big this guy is! Woah! He's huge! 11-foot King Cobra! Prashanth ready? These guys are... So difficult to handle sometimes! We should be very gentle! Letâ€™s see if he gets into the bag now! Yeah! That's good! Good God! I thought he's not gonna get into the bag... But... He helped us out a bit. He has co-operated with us... Anyway! Come, let'sâ€¦ Let's go release him! Yeah! Ufff!! You saw how the rescue mission was... So, the next time if and when a snake enters your house... You do know whom to call to rescue? Call me... I've already had experience with three snakes! That doesn't mean that I will come like a hero! I will inform people like Gowri Shankar, because... To do this kind of a job, firstly it requires knowledge, hence, if by mistake at that time if we try to act like a hero, we'll get into troubleâ€¦ Wildlife! Be it King Cobra.. or any other type of dangerous species. They will trouble us only if we trouble themâ€¦ So... In this matter, let's avoid heroism! What a fantastic experience Amogh. It was exceedingly amazing! I am so happy! Honestly it was wonderful! 15-foot Snake! And then... The way Gowri Shankar handled it, after that releasing it in the forest. It was fabulous! Very nice! So, you would have visited forests a minimum of about 200-300 times? or even more than that! - Yes, yes. What is one of the most favourite story, or unforgettable incident? Do you have any unforgettable incident? There are many! But thenâ€¦ A few of them are special. One is very special, but if I have to tell you thatâ€¦ I have to take you to that place, we should sit, hold a drink in the hand... Only if you listen to it like that will you really enjoy it! So, you mean like a 4D experience? Okay! Let's try that too! That will be nice. Let's go... Thank You! Massive bouldersâ€¦ Great dynasties! Extraordinary wilderness... Large hearted people! This is our 'Deccan'! Now we have come to Vijayanagara, Ballari, boulder areas. Yes! What do they call these forests? We call them scrub jungles or hilly forests. Here, similar to Africa's Savannah Grasslandsâ€¦ Yes, yes, yes! Thoseâ€¦ You have seen those... - I saw when I went there! Yesâ€¦ It is that kind of landscape! In factâ€¦ It's a very rare landscape! It is very tough to see these kinds of landscape! Such a beautiful landscape! See, right in front of us we can see an amazing structure! It's wonderfulâ€¦ So nice! Bear! Bear! See there! Where? Near that rock! There, there! Can you see the boulder? The boulder next to the tree. Oh! Yes, yes, yes! Wow! Did you see it? Shall we will go near it? No! No! No! We can't go near the bear because the bear is a very dangerous animal! Lot of attacks in this area happen due to bears! The farther we are from it, the safer it is! But at home, if we keep as a soft toy, it is better! Correct. In front of it, we have to keep away! Correct! Correct! That's why they say: You shouldn't feed sweets to a bear at night! Not just at night, even in the day, not just a sweet. we should not feed it anything! We have to keep distance from it and enjoy watching them from far! Yes, yes! Give that. Look at it! There is no TV, no phone or anything elseâ€¦ it's just playing by itself and it's happier than us!! But excellent! For the first time, I am seeing it in the wild! We have always heard someone say, It would frequent this place or that... You have got me to an amazing place! Sunset time! It's time to tell your story. I think, this story... ..happened 15 years ago. As you can see, a road just like that! The forest on one side and farms on the other! My friend and I were driving towards Hampi, It was 7pm and totally dark... Just the lights from the car. Suddenly something crossed the road! I thought it was a dog but the tail was a little longer. We searched with our lights here and there but couldn't find anything.. After searching for ten minutes, what we saw were shining eyes! It was... A leopard! As we were looking at each other and clicking pictures, two hours just flew without our knowledge! The first snap of a leopard taken in this area, was that! That leopardâ€¦ was headed to the shepherd camp nearby was going to hunt sheep. in this area, leopards and wolves hunting sheep is very common. Nice! It's a wonderful experience! Won't they be unhappy? Because the only property they possess is sheep. Be it their living, their livelihood or be it anything elseâ€¦ going around everywhere, Sheep are their only property actually! Won't they feel bad? Even that's a very interesting story but you have to listen to that story from them only! A lamb with a gypsy... To wander, and guide them is the aim! Wandering around forests, mountains and hills! We have come here to protect the flock of sheep! Our home is where we stand.. Sky being our roof... Making bread &amp; singing songs we compose.. A lamb with a gypsy... To wander, and guide them is the aim! Oooo.... A lamb with a gypsy... See here sir, my friend was saying, here your sheepâ€¦ Are taken by wolves, Yes, they take them away. Won't you feel bad? They are like our siblings. So, they will come often and eat your sheep Yes, they do. Earlier the shepards had no worries, they would let the sheep free in the hills.. God has created wolves.. let the wolf grab sheep, which brings worry to the shepard If the wolf eats a sheep - will he be more attentive.. Hence, he has created the wolves! The wolves will come and eat the sheep, due to that shepherds become alert and the shepherds keep a sharp eye on the sheep. Wolves are like siblings to us. Wherever if we go, he comes following us. Even if we shift from here, he will follow us there also. If we go by morning, Catching our scent.. he comes following us by night. In our lives, there is no understanding between humans! Yes. See how well they co-exist with animals! I really appreciate that. You have given us fantastic rotti, it was very nice. It's fine. It is all God's blessings. It is all Lord Beera's blessings, let it be! Lord Beera's blessings. - Correct! When I usually come to this part of Karnataka, - A lamb with a gypsy be it for shooting or for a holiday, I have a few favorite places of my own. - A lamb with a gypsy A place which I like a lot, now we will go there. A lamb with a gypsy... To wander, and guide them is the aim! What an amazing place you have got me to, I have come here so many times but have never seen Tungabhadra like this. Thank you. How Tungabhadra is important to the people of North Karnataka, the people of North Karnataka are as important to me! Becauseâ€¦ the love, affection and respect they show towards our family... Whatever words I use won't suffice! For our entire Kannada film Industry North Karnataka is a huge support, I can say! Even today, if you talk about Krishnadevaraaya, your father, Dr. Rajkumar is whom we visualise! That's how art &amp; artists remainâ€¦ Immortal! Even after a 1000 years, people remember them as they were, is that not so? This river that is flowing since a 1000 years, even this river is Immortal, is it not? Absolutelyâ€¦ Absolutely! There are records of man's presence here since 4000 years! Be they as rock paintings, or in Neolithic burial ground, Maurya's homes Many different civilizations, being dependent on this river, have lived here since thousands of years. The rain forests that we came from, it is in those forests that most of these rivers originate from. If there was no forest there, then these districts here would not have had water. Because there are forests there that today Tungabhadra is flowing here. The people here have water for agriculture and drinking now. Somewhere, when we remember our past and read about the history there, I somehow feel now, that our bonding, I mean, our emotional connect with rivers has diminished a lot! But one thing that gives me hope is that even now in a few places, tribals and forest dwellers, have still kept that connect alive. Infact, near Kali river, there is a tribe that coexist very closely with nature They still worship the river as they did.. ...thousands of years ago. You have organized an amazing boat. The fact that makes me happy is for the first time I am rowing on my own to an island and camping. That too... in the river of our beloved land... In River Kali. We shall do one thing. The place you can see ahead, we will camp there. From there we will wake up in the morning and... I told you about a village, right? We will go where the tribals live... Yes, yes, yes. - We'll go there! We'll go there! The tribal village. - Yes. Looking forward to it. This... Small place! We can think of it as an island, coming to this island, It might be the boat ride then camping here for a day. Swimming... Swimming here was an amazing experience! In the Kali river... Fresh water To the best of my knowledge, we may have swam about 100-150 metres. No idea as to how deep it was or the kinds of fishes there were. We forgot everything. Be it the fragrance of the water or it's taste when we drank it Swimming here was an amazing experience! When I come to such places, I feel like spending a few days... Spend some time, forget everything and relax here! but when we get time to spend for ourselves There's nothing like nature... Being amidst nature.. ..is an amazing experience! Whenever I get time, in a good season and in rainy season when fresh water flows in I feel like swimming once in all these places. The air and water that God has given, this nature. It's free, right? People feel happy when they know it is free. But what we've gotten for free, this wonderful atmosphere Somewhere I feel we are polluting it. The planet that we've got, is not our ancestral property but is borrowed from our next generation. So to safeguard it is ourâ€¦ Responsibility.. 100%... The children to come, I mean, for the future generations. How much of this we safeguard that they'll enjoy! That's why... It's really, really important. Itâ€™s so.. beautiful. Thanks to Kaliâ€¦ Thanks to Kali! Just about when our outward journey was coming to an endâ€¦ Another all important one was beginningâ€¦ That wasâ€¦ Our inner journey! Wow! It's superb... Amazing! Nice... Nice pictures. This bird has a good colour combination. Is this from South America? No, no, it is from here only. It's called Malabar Pied Hornbill, this bird is found in our Malnad region itself. It is a very, very special bird. Okay nice... An interesting story about this is that it eats a lot of fruits and in the forest when it excretes its seeds trees grow in many places! So these are called as 'The farmers of the forest.' They are called as the farmers of the forest. So it's because of this bird here, Many trees we see in the forest might have grown. Just like planting saplings everywhere. Exactly! You said it right! - Nice, nice, superb! Farmers of the... Forest? The forest's own farmer. Superb! These birds are really something else! Watching birds in the city means something else totally! Watching birds in the forest is something entirely different. Correct, correct! Here we're watching birds in the forest becauseâ€¦ in the forest many different birds make unique sounds. Recently when we had camped somewhere the sound that we heard, you said it was some kind of owl. Right. It was an owl! It was screaming like a ghost! Yes, yes. And here, it is whistling! Yes. It's like it is catcalling someone. Maybe humans learnt all this from birds itself, is that not so? Whatever we have learnt, we have learnt from nature itself! Correct. Someone is coming on the bike. Greetings! - Greetings! Is everything fine? - Everything is fine. Where are you from? Here only sir, Patagudi. Patagudi. - Patagudi. Greetings! - Greetings! He gave the bike and went away!? I just asked him to give the bike, he just gave and went away. This is how it is over here. So, it's now ours then? Our's only, we can take it! Now the remaining distance... The remaining distance... - We can cover on the bike. On the bike! - Fantastic. Come, sit. Start. You sitâ€¦ I will sit after you start. It's not starting? No, it's not! Shall I try? You want to try? Try it nowâ€¦ You ride it. I couldn't even start it! You only ride it. Okay, let's try... Come! To an extent, I'll try to take you there safely. Let's try! As soon as we got the bike, I only took the bike to ride it. The bike was not even in the best condition, it was halfway there! The ride was beautiful! It was just amazing! As we neared it, we could could see the village... Beautiful! Patagudi. Somewhere, as soon as I came to this village, I felt as happy as I would be visiting my own village. The paddy fields around.. and the nine families that lived there on the fields. Amazing! Beautiful! After coming here all those experiences came back to me! Amazing environment! Such nice people! Mostly, in all the villages in our place the people are like this! Fantastic experience! In this village.. there are only nine homesâ€¦ About fifty people. And in it, there is a Government Lower Primary School. I never knew that villages like these existed because it is three years since they got electricity. They have started watching TV now earlier they were charging their batteries or using solar power and watching movies and the such. When we entered the school, there were about twenty children there. All were from this village itself. From the same family. Does anyone of you know who this is? Raise your hands if you do. They didn't know who I was and when asked about my fatherâ€¦ they looked around as they didnâ€™t know! Only three children there orâ€¦ the teacher there knew me, thats all! Apart from that nobody knew who I was. Ok, I will teach them a small poem. - Fine. Will you all repeat what I sing? Then, it's meaning you have to ask him only. Is that fine? Wherever you may be... - (A song written by state poet Kuvempu) Wherever you may be... - (A song written by state poet Kuvempu) However you may be... However you may be... Forever you... Forever you... Hold Kannada in your heart! Hold Kannada in your heart! Kannada is the truth... Kannada is the truth... Kannada is forever! Kannada is forever! What was shocking was that in our Karnataka, there is a place like this... Where they don't even know to speak Kannada properly They don't have much knowledge about movies. School &amp; education is important to all! There are schools but they are not enough facilities for proper education. All this should remain in my mind and yours and it should be in everyone's mind, I feel! Let all these children learn to read and write soon and let them all prosper. To focus on education is our responsibility, I feel. Since we are here, are they showing us thier ancestral dance or is it on the lines of treating guests like God! That's one of the reasons, the other is that tomorrow, they will go to the birthplace of river Kali and offer their prayers. That is why a day before, they have kept a celebration like this. Super! Can we get an opportunity to go along? If you're interested we can definitely go with them tomorrow. Let's go... How far is it? It's about eight kilometres sir. Eight kilometres? - It's a pathway. A pathway. - A pathway. We have to walk and go through the forest, if it's okay with you, we will go! Done. As the journey with Puneeth progressed, I began to understand the depth of his persona! Curious about the world, zeal to learn new things, the eagerness to mingle with his land and his people and beyond all these, his childlike simplicity! Just like water, he too is immortal! â€œWho is a true hero?â€ To this question of mine, I found the answer. A heroâ€¦ is a true 'Universal Human'! We have to conserve water &amp; should use it less in the same way, we have to protect our forests. Perhaps we should slightly limit our desires in our lives and the same desire should be tuned more towards nature is what I feel! We... As frequently as we get an opportunity, if we spend time with nature, how to love nature, how to respect it, I feel that awareness will increase. If the forests still remain so lush, then it is only because of God Our ancient practicesâ€¦ When we are in the midst of nature, we get a lot of time to think about ourselves. I do not know if we are new to the forest or if the forest is new to us... I don't know! We get happiness that is unknown to us, because nature is not something that is of today but has existed since millions of years, so I feel it is very important to respect it.
