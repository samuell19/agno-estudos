(traffic humming) (horn honking) (car engine rumbling) (soft eerie music) (mail slot creaking) (mail thudding) (glass clinking) (soft eerie music continues) (car engine rumbling) (Helga sighing) (glasses rattling) (paper rustling) (Traudi panting) (Helga sighs) (light dramatic music) (glass shattering) - Oh! (bell dinging) (door creaking) - Gran? - One moment darling. Hello. (drawer thudding) - Pretty pink envelope, Gran. Secret letters? - Oh, don't be ridiculous. (eerie music) (Traudi panting) (buzzer dinging) - [Emily] He's twice my age and married. Gran? - Yes? - You okay? - Yes. - Come sit down. What's the matter? Did something happen? - No, darling, it's all fine. (Helga sighs) Well, actually, it's not all fine really. But it's very hard to explain. - [Emily] Try, please. (desk rattling) (stethoscope thudding) (Beth moaning) (Chris grunting) (Beth gasping) (Beth sighs) - Oh, shit, what time is it? - Huh? - I need to be meeting Mom and Emily. Bollocks. - I... - I'm so sorry. I'll call you later. (lips smacking) That was fantastic. (Beth giggling) - I have like a million questions. (bell dinging) - Oh, it's Beth. - Indian, Chinese, pizza? (bell dinging) - Let's just go home, Mom. - [Helga] Yes, if you don't mind I actually have to finish this dress. - Oh, wow, you two are a bunch of fun. I'd have stayed with Chris and had seconds. - [Helga] Oh, so you've eaten? - No, Mom, I was referring to sex. - [Helga] Oh, Beth. - Really, Mom? (Beth sighs) - Let's go. Come on. Chinese? - Sounds good. (door creaking) (bell dinging) (Helga sighs) (dog barking) (soft music) (plates clanking) - I can't believe she's still alive. I can't bear that she didn't tell me. How could she tell you and not me? - Don't start this again. Isn't it a good thing? I have a great granny. - Oh, Jesus, Emily. Not everything is happily every after. How can it be good if she's hidden it from us all her life? - Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. And now she's going to Vienna by herself and I'll be here worried about her, worried what the hell is going on. - I could go. - Oh, no, you don't. You've got your exams. - Mr. Groves said I needed to talk to people who'd actually lived through the war. So, Vienna would be perfect. - Oh, did he really? (Beth chuckling) Is this the Mr. Groves? And who's gonna pay for this trip? No. No, it's better that she just copes on her own. - Why don't you go then? - It's too expensive. - Gran would pay. - Don't you dare ask her! - All right. Chill out. - I have a living grandmother. (both giggling) (silverware clanking) (sewing machine rattling) (ominous music) (Helga gasping) (dramatic banging) (sewing machine rattling) (sewing machine rattling) (suspenseful music) (Helga sniffling) (suspenseful music) (door slamming) (Helga sighs) - Okay. Darling, help me. That's it. - All right. - Mom, Gran, (sighs). I decided the best way to resolve this is to get to Vienna too. - What? - No, it was not me. - It makes perfect sense. You were worried about Gran, and I can look after her while I'm working. - Look after her? (Beth scoffs) - Why didn't you to me first? Why doesn't anyone ever talk to me? Am I really such an ogre? Really, Emily, have I not always been there for you? Tell me have I not? - For God sake, Mom, this isn't about us. It's just a couple of days in Vienna. - And who's gonna be paying for these couple of days in Vienna? - Dad. - What? - Oh, come on you two. I've got a plane to catch. - [Beth] Wait, you knew about this? - No, I didn't and it's a terrible idea, darling. You know, darling, I don't have time to look after you. - I'm not the one that needs looking after. You're the old lady. - Oh, God, I give up! - Sorry, okay? - Well, okay, but listen, it's not going to be a jolly. You know there's a job to be done, yes? - I know we have to sort out the flat. - Now he wants to pay? I don't believe it. - [Emily] Every time Dad comes up we have to argue. - [Helga] Darling, don't be unkind. - Darling, you don't even have any clothes. I mean what are you gonna wear? - I've got clean bra, clean pants, make up, make up remover- - No, just put that back. - Toothbrush, toothpaste, kitchen sink, notepad, pen. - They're gonna take all of that off you in security. What then? - Well, great. Then I can buy more in Vienna, can't I? 'Cause there are shops there too! Fuck's sake. - Right.

(lips smacking) - And we were hungry. (Eva giggling) (Eva sighs) - I'm sorry for the short notice, but she's not well. Very weak. She could go to sleep one night and not wake. - No, I'm grateful to you honestly. - You will visit her, yes? (elevator whirring) (elevator dinging) - Oh course we will. Won't we, Gran? Tomorrow? (keys jingling) (soft eerie music) (window creaking) Look at all this stuff. - The rubbish of her life. I hate to think what they'd find in my house. - Are there photos? - No. There are no photos. (haunting music) - There is a box. I saved them. - I think Emily and I can pick up from here. (keys jingling) Listen, Eva, thank you for everything. Yeah? (lips smacking) And we'll see you later. - Yeah, yeah. - You were a bit mean to her. - Look, let me handle it. Okay? - You're freaking me out. This is nasty, Gran. (Helga growling) (Helga chuckling) - Darling, don't exaggerate. (Helga sighs) (bells chiming) - Is this her? - Yes, with my brother, Peter. - [Emily] I didn't know you had a brother. - Yeah. Must've been taken just before she left. - What do you mean left? And where's Peter now? - He died. (haunting music continues) (muffled children yelling) - [Emily] Look what I found. He's so cute. He was just in a rubbish bag, but he's way too cute to throw out. - Oh. Oh, my goodness. It's Zako. - Zako? - Zakopade. - Strange name for a teddy. (Helga gasps) - Well, father was on leave from the army. It was one of those rare happy days when they bought it for me. Oh (sniffing). Hm. - He's well loved. - Yes, but not by me. - Come. I found a load of her jewelry. - Oh. - Isn't it beautiful? - Hm, but I don't think that we should take her things while she's still alive. - You said it would just be going to a charity shop. - [Helga] Yeah, it's better that way. - Why? - [Helga] Because I don't want you to have it. (Helga sighs) (Helga laughing) (Emily giggling) (both laughing) Whew! - [Emily] God, it's so beautiful up here. - [Helga] Yes, but I, I just feel cold. And wintry. - No, Gran, it's beautiful. (soft music) - [Helga] The luxury of being young, my darling grandchild, is that you don't see the past in everything. - [Emily] But that's your choice, Gran. I don't wanna be like that when I'm old. - [Helga] Well, it's not always so easy. (Emily sighs) - Fine, I will learn. (fire crackling) (muffled talking) - [Woman] More wine? - How did Peter die? - He took his own life. Darling, I don't really want to burden you with all this. - I'm not a child anymore. I can handle it. Okay? - I hope so. (bells chiming) - "I've gone to see her. Have a great day. Left you a map. Dinner? Gran." (Emily sighs) Thanks, I wanted to meet her too. (door slamming) Hi. - Where are you from? - London. - What's your name? - Emily. - Oh, my name is Serge. How about a coffee? A tea? (Emily chuckling) A smoothie? - I shouldn't, I have stuff to do. - Well, I think you should. - Maybe just a quick one. (light music) (spoon rattling) - Bon app. - Can you show me the new memorial? Near the Jewish Museum. - [Serge] Sure. (dog barking) (dog panting) - I've been texting her, but she hasn't replied. Neither of them have. It's like the two of them have this amazing relationship and I'm always left out. I hate being left out. (Chris chuckling) I do. - Why don't you just let me move in with you? (Beth grumbling) Hm? - It's a lovely thought, but... - Yeah, I can't keep asking you this, Beth. Just... I'll see you at work, all right? - Don't just leave. (car engine rumbling) (gentle music) - Helga, she wasn't the only one. People wanted him, you know? They voted for answers. Traudi threw flowers at him while his car drove past. - At least your mother didn't leave you for him. (Eva sighs) - I was nine when the Russians came. You know what I saw. Is that not enough for you? I arrived too late to stop them. - Well, you couldn't have stopped them. You were a child. (Eva crying) Eva, please pull over. We're going to crash. - I'm fine! I'm fine. - Listen, it's misting up. Can we put this on now? - Don't move it. - [Helga] Look, Eva, do you want me to drive? - [Eva] No, it's okay. Sorry, Helga, sorry. (light music) - Not this one, we're getting a normal one. - I thought there was many of them. So, why are you doing this? - What? - This. - I (chuckling). I don't know, I'm not sure. - Do you do it a lot? - No, never. No. - So, why with me? - God, you have so many questions. I just (scoffs). Because it feels good. (crow cawing) - [Eva] Here. - Flowers? - Of course. - But I don't want to give her flowers. - You can give her flowers and then you can put out your tongue like this. (Eva groaning) (both chuckling) I'm sorry, Helga. - It's all right. All right, if I can also do this. (both giggling) - Take this, Helga. Take this. Hey, go, go. (Helga sighing) (muffled talking) (Helga panting) - [Helga] No, I am your daughter, Helga. I am Helga. - [Helga] I am your daughter. Speak English, I know you can. - Look at me. - Zako. - Yeah. - No, I didn't steal him. He's mine. - I am your daughter. - Yeah. - Yes, with us, with Helga and Peter. Your children. - I am Helga. - Yes. - Yeah. (Traudi laughing) (Helga hushes) - Listen, listen. I just flew over to sort out your flat and do your things. You understand? So, what do you want me to do with it all? - I'm not dead yet. - [Helga] I knew you could speak English. - I know you can speak German. (Helga laughing) - [Helga] Look just, let's just sit here shall we? And talk like two adults, yes? - No one comes to see me. I'm so alone. Will you? Will you come and see me? You will come won't you? - I brought you this. Look. Here. - Oh, it's me next to Margarete. She never liked me much. But you know, those days people, they were very, very suspicious. Who is that? Next to Margarete? That man. Bearchman. Bearchman. - I don't know, I was three years old. Look here. I bought you these. (tissue paper rustling) (somber music) What are you doing? (Traudi gasping) - [Man] Hey! - You were very pretty as a little girl. And now how old are you? - [Helga] 62. - It can't be. I don't want that. I'm still beautiful. How can I have a daughter like an old lady? - I'm telling the truth. Is there a law against it? (flowers thudding) - [Carer] I will find you a nice quiet room. She'll calm down. Honestly, it's not you. (Traudi gasping) (traffic humming) (light music) - Oh, for God's sakes. Answer the bloody phone. (phone thudding) I clear up her crap out all the time. Having to clear up after you even when you're not here. Ridiculous. (glass clinking) (Beth sighs) (Beth groaning) (Beth panting) (Beth sniffling) (papers rustling) (phone ringing) (Chris sighs) (phone thudding) (muffled talking) - You know each book signifies a single life, and the life story of one person. - Oh, that's very impressive, Professor. - Yeah, it is. I do my research. (muffled talking) (somber music) - Are you following me? (eerie music) Emily. (light music) (eerie music) - So many people, you know? I wonder who they were. I wish I knew them. Sorry, that sounds really stupid. - It doesn't. I also came to Vienna to try to understand. - Really? Maybe it's fate that we met. - One of them was my grandmother. - Sorry, idiot. - No, don't be sorry. It's fine. I never ever met her. (birds squawking) (clock ticking) - I had to leave. I had no choice. I had taken an oath. I couldn't go back on it. - What oath? - I chose to swear absolute obedience and loyalty until death. - But why did you swear an oath when you had children to look after? (Traudi sighs) - You cannot understand. No one can understand now. I wanted it more than my family. - I have to go. - When you were little, do you remember, I called you mousey. And you were stubborn and clever and naughty. And you liked hopping on one leg. Oh, my daughter. Please come back again. Don't leave alone. Promise? You promise? - I will come back tomorrow. - And bring me roses. Red roses. - Red roses. (traffic humming) (light dramatic music) (Helga gasps) (bell dinging) - Yeah, I have to go. - No, you don't. You don't have to go. - I have to. - You do have to? You really have to? (traffic humming) (intercom ringing) - Sleep well. Good night. (intercom ringing) - Come on, Chris, it's bloody freezing down here. (Beth sighs) (bell chiming) (metal clanking) - Just two minutes. One minute. (fingers tapping) - Hey. - I have to run, but later? - Oh, okay. - Okay. - Well, give me a kiss then. (fingers tapping) Come on. (soft music) - Emily, come on. (Emily sighs) So, this visit is just to say goodbye. We'll reassure her about the flat and you get to meet her, and then we're done and we can go home. - Okay, well we might actually enjoy ourselves. - Oh, don't be ridiculous. And don't pay too much attention to her. She's very old and quite delusional. How did your work go yesterday? - Good. I spent most of the day learning French. - Darling, you're so gullible. And you're always falling for these older men. You must be careful. - I'm not gullible. I wanted to. And who's to say he's not my future husband? (Helga chuckling) - You're crazy. If only it was so easy. (light music) (birds chirping) - And then this is my favorite red. See? Shall I? - [Traudi] You're lovely, so young, so pretty. (muffled talking) - Gran, will you take it? - [Helga] Oh, no, darling, we don't need photos. - Yes, we do. It's just this one here. - Oh, I... I'm not much good with them, you know? (camera clicking) I think it worked. I don't know. (Emily laughing) - Ah, you are wearing my necklace. - [Emily] I'm sorry, I shouldn't have just taken it. - It's perfect. It should be worn by someone so young and pretty. See how beautiful she looks in my necklace? My necklace and her, both so pretty. My granddaughter. - Great granddaughter. (car engine rumbling) - You know, they all flirted with me. - Who flirted with you? - [Traudi] The guards. We had such a good time. - Which guards? - Traudi, no. Traudi. - Why do you say Traudi, Traudi? What's no? - [Helga] We're not going to talk about this now, all right? Darling, come on, let's just have a cup of coffee with me. - I don't want any coffee. I'm actually really enjoying myself. - Listen, you don't understand. Come, have a cup of coffee with me. - But- - Emily, come. - [Traudi] I'm not hiding anything, Helga. I want to talk about it. I'm proud of my job. - You're not going to tell her anything. Do you hear me? You are not going to tell her anything- - [Emily] What on earth is going on? What are you doing, Gran? - I was the Senior Guard in the most famous camps of them all, Auschwitz. - Traudi. - The Auschwitz? - Yes. - You were actually in the camps, why? - Yes, it was my job. I was the assistant to the doctors. - [Emily] When people were ill? - Yes. I had to take the temperatures. - So, you were a nurse? Just like mom. - No, she was, she was not like mom. - What else did you do? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? What else did you do? - Traudi. - I had to tie the prisoners to the tables. - What do you mean? - Are you incapable, incapable of knowing what is appropriate and what is not? We carried out experiments to see what would happen if we inject the patients with various diseases. - You poisoned them. - No, what she means is that they infected them with gangrene and with tetanus and then they watched them die horrible and futile deaths. - How foolish you are and how mistaken. Our doctors were outstanding professionals. - [Helga] Oh, I know, I know, yes, you were desensitized so that you didn't feel anything, and so that you could go and kill thousands of innocent people. (Helga deeply breathing) - But you knew about this? Does mom know? (Helga sighs) She doesn't, does she? Oh, my God. (Helga sniffling) - Darling, I- - Just don't touch me. - Darling, don't. Look, Emily- - Don't touch me! I feel sick. - It's not fun talking to my daughter. - Oh, shut up! Darling, darling, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. You're the most precious thing in the world to me. - What the fuck am I supposed to do with this shit now? - Oh, sweetheart, come here- - Just don't touch me. God, no wonder mom was always so paranoid. You never told her the truth about anything. - Don't talk to me about the truth. You have no idea, really, Emily, you have no idea. - No, I don't 'cause you wouldn't tell us anything. Not a single bloody word for decades. And my poor mom spent her entire life trying to make sure that you were okay. That everything was okay for you. Everyone always tiptoeing around you. Trying not to push you too far because you had such a terrible childhood. What the fuck were you thinking? That you would come here and change her? That she would turn around and it'd all be a joke? - No, of course not. I didn't know what it would be like. I, I, I, I didn't want to be here. (Helga stuttering) Why do you think I've never come before? - [Emily] I don't bloody know. - And I told you not to come, but you insisted, so here you are and now you can't cope. (Helga stuttering) And now suddenly it's all about you and how you feel, and I thought you said you'd come here to look after me. (Helga stuttering) - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Emily gasping) There I was yesterday with Serge. His grandmother was killed potentially by my great grandma. I am so fucking done with this place. This fucked up place where everyone pretends that nothing ever happened. - Can I make you a cup of tea? Look a bit pale. - Oh, thanks, Dani. I did have a bad night. I should be making tea for you. - It's fine. (light music) ♪ A heart of gold ♪ - Do you take sugar? - No, thanks, Dani. (light music) (letter rustling) (Beth sighs) (somber music) (Emily sniffling) - Fuck, just pick up. - [Helga] Why can't I hate you? - Do you mean hate? What have you got to hate me for? - [Helga] Thank you. - They had good biscuits in the camps. The comrades made sure for that. Real coffee, salami, butter, Polish vodka, cigarettes. - We had bread made from rapeseed. I was always hungry. You didn't really care what had happened to us did you? - They gave us important books to read. Reading helped me relax before going to sleep. - [Helga] Sleep? How could you sleep? Didn't you even feel sorry for the children? - Why would I? A Jewish child (scoffs) will become a Jewish adult. - We could have been Jewish children. - My children were Aryan. We had nothing to fear. My children were perfect. - My children? My children? I am here now. Talk to me. Can't you at least listen to what I'm saying? I was scared, I was lonely and I had to cope with all that without my mother. Without you. (light dinging) You, you never once called me Mutti, and you say you are my daughter? And you do not call me Mutti. Am I not your mother? Then you will call me Mutti. All the children called their mothers Mutti. I want you to. - I can't do it. - You cannot call me Mutti? - No, I can't. I'm not used to it. I can't do it. - I don't understand. If I tell you the truth you will call me Mutti? - There's nothing you can tell me now. - I was in the Waffen-SS. I had to obey the doctors' orders. - I was just hoping for one moment with you. - [Traudi] Brack. I knew Dr. Brack quite well. (Helga sighs) - I don't want to hear about them. - First, you must call me Mutti. Then I will stop. - Fine. Mutti. (Traudi gasps) - Again, again. - Mutti. (Traudi crying) (somber music) (drawer thudding) (cabinet thudding) (boxes thudding) - Bugger! Shit. Oh, my God. (somber music continues) - I have no intention of interrogating you. - I am innocent. I'm not guilty. I obeyed orders like everyone else. (Helga sighs) And you obeyed too. In school they taught you to hate the Jews and you hated the Jews. You cannot tell me that is not true. It was snowy. I remember you children turned on them, and even you, Helga, pulled the hair of a woman, and then you came home, shouted "Bloody Jews!" You can't get away from me, dear. And don't act the innocent. Oh, come from England to put me on trial. (Helga scoffs) But I will turn this on you. Do you hear? I will not let you do it. (wheelchair clanking) What? What is this? - We are going outside. Please. (light dramatic music) - I might catch cold. - Well, maybe it will finish you off. - We are alike, like two eggs. (light dramatic music) (birds chirping) Eva told me you met Hitler. I didn't believe her. I said she was playing with me. Did you meet him, Mousey, did you? - [Helga] Yes. - Really, Mousey, you met him? - [Helga] Yes, I met him. - Tell me. Tell me, was he handsome? - We were picked up one morning in a bus. All I could think of was how hungry I was and whether they would feed us. Oh, I was so scared. I remember my legs were shaking. - You should have been proud and strong. - We waited forever and then he came. He was limping. He looked really old, sick. He had two bodyguards, one on either side. He shook hands with all of us in the front row. First Peter, then me. I felt as if I was being hypnotized by a snake. (haunting music) He didn't like children either. - Come give your old Mutti a kiss. (trees rustling) Oh, you are my Mousey. (somber music) (letters rustling) (Beth crying) (car engine rumbling) (somber music continues) (trunk slamming) (plane roaring) (trees rustling) - [Helga] There's something I've had nightmares about for years. - What? What is it? - How long did it take? - The gas? It took between three and 15 minutes. - And is it true that, that the exposure time to the gas was then shortened? - Is that important? - I don't know why, but yes it is. - I wouldn't know. - You don't know or you don't want to answer? - They had to get through 12,000 schtuk a day. They had raised the quota. Germany had to get rid of every last member of this wretched race. - And you supported that? - You think I was on holiday? What are you thinking? - And is it possible that when you opened the doors that some people possibly were still alive? - What do you mean you don't know? I thought you were a figure of authority in the camp? I thought everybody was always keeping you informed of everything that was going on? - I don't care, you're not going in. I'm not going to let you! - I don't care. Speak English! - And yet you still didn't know whether people who were not quite dead were taken to the crematorium? (Helga sighing) - Why am I doing this? - Not everyone died at the same rate. You could not predict. Newborn babies took only a few minutes. Some were literally collected blue. - You're evil. - You are not leaving. I don't want it. You can't leave me! (light dramatic music) (door creaking) - Hello. - Hi. Is Serge working tonight? - No, he's at Calculla, but it's not so far from here. - Can I take a glass of water please? - Yeah, sure. (soft music) Hi. - Hi.

Maybe we could stay warm with the beautiful lady. - Thank you.

Fuck sake that was really fucking stupid what you just did in there. - How dare you, you two faced fuck. - Hey, hey. How old are you? Seriously, how old are you? What do you think that guy wanted from you? - He wanted me, that's what he wanted. - Well, yes, he did. But do you really wanna spend the rest of your life being felt up by pervs? What are you trying to prove? (Emily sighs) - I saw your wife and your child today. They're both beautiful. - Yes, he is. But, Emily, she's not my wife. She's not. - God, you're a bastard. - Hey, hey. I never said I was without ties. I told you I was here to look after someone and it's true. I am and I do. - It's all okay then isn't it? It's not fucking okay! It's not fucking- - Calm down, look at me. What happened? (Emily panting) - It's never gonna be the same again. - Oh, for fuck sake. Emily, you're enjoying this way too much. - Fuck you! - Seriously? That's brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Very grown up. Thank you so much. (somber music) (spoon clinking) - She didn't tell me anything. I, I don't know if your name is Eva or Eva or- - It's Eva, like happy ever after. (both giggling) - Oh. - Kipferl? - Oh, thank you. (somber music) "Traudi Sorger was sentenced by an Allied jury to serve a six year prison term for war crimes, and for being a member of the SS. The judge described her as a lying, opportunistic, fanatical hypocrite, who has persistently shown herself to be untrustworthy, unreliable, and unrepentant. Her work as an SS guard is documented in the Wiesenthal Center in Vienna and... And at Auschwitz." (haunting music) - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Listen. I want you to hear me. Do you hear me? It's not my fault. I was, I was just a child. My mother was a Nazi. - Did you hear that? My mother was the worst kind of Nazi! And I'm her daughter. (Helga sighs) (Helga sighs) (haunting music) - Don't be too angry with her. It's a lot to live with. She was very brave to go to England, to start again. - I'm not angry. Not now, I'm... No, that's not true, I'm fucking... I'm sorry. I'm furious. If she'd been open with me, talked to me, told me, then maybe she could have shown me... (Beth sniffling) She could have shown me that she loved me. (somber music) - [Serge] Come in, it's cold. (door creaking) (door thudding) (somber music continues) (trolley clanking) (somber music continues) (Helga crying) (Helga bawling) (trolley clanking) - Thank you. - No, thank you for finding me. Your mother, she needs you two. Don't give up. Go. - [Beth] Goodbye. (gentle music) (bird cawing) (keys jingling) - Mom? (door slamming) (shoes clicking) (Helga sighing) My Mom is here and I kinda know why she is, so I need to find them. - Yeah, that's fair enough. I can take you. - That's the thing, you can't. - Why? - I met my great grandmother yesterday, and it turns out she's a war criminal. She did the most horrific things. - What? (Emily gasps) Oh, did you really think it would change anything? (lips smacking) Come on, let's go. (motorcycle rumbling) (water splashing) - Why didn't you come with that pretty girl? Where is she? - I don't know. - Your daughter, will you bring her one day? Will she call me Oma? Will she call me Oma? Have you got a husband? - [Helga] I'm a widow. - He was probably very old. - My husband died when he was just 50. - Yes, quite old. - [Helga] So, we must say goodbye now. I have to go home. - I know there are things you wanted to ask me. - No, no, there is nothing. - You want to know why, don't you? Because- - Enough I don't want to know. Enough. - There is something I have, and maybe it can explain it. - Beth! (light dramatic music) (motorcycle rumbling) - No I don't. I found the letters. I forgive you. Oh, no, I don't for fuck sakes. - Beth, listen- - I haven't finished! You didn't tell me. And you never cuddled me like a proper mother should, and now you're more of a mom to Emily than you ever were to me and you bring her here and... And it's just too much. (Beth crying) - Beth, I'm sorry. (Helga sighs) - Helga! - She's, I... Beth, we will talk I promise, just not now. - Oh, for fucks sakes. - Come to see. - Yes. - Help me. - Jesus. (motorcycle rumbling) (eerie music) - [Serge] Hey, hey, hey, hold on a second. - Sorry. - It's fine. Look at me. This is nice, us, today. (lips smacking) I think you need to get going. All right? - Okay, okay. - Good luck. (gate creaking) - Thank you. (lips smacking) - Oh, there's the pretty one. I have something for you. - Are you all right? - I look wonderful in this. It will suit you. - No! - Oh, not you. You pretty one. - You're a poisonous woman. You are a poisonous woman. - You call me that? - Yes, I do. - But you don't mind she wears my necklace? Where do you think that came from? It was made for me at the camps. - What's she talking about? - Nothing. Nothing, darling, really. Nothing. - Who's was it? - The gold from the prisoner's teeth was made into jewelry at the camps. (ominous music) (necklace thudding) - How did you become this? - War changed people. War changed us too. - You think that lets you off do you? - Is that how you see me, as a criminal? Is that you see your mother? Oh, poor Mousey. I left you speechless. Like it or not my daughter, I never stop feeling proud to belong to the Germany of our great fuhrer. I'm sorry to disappoint you. I told you the truth, the whole truth. - For God's sake. - The truth you wanted. Then I believed it and now I believe it. Give me my jacket. It's mine. I want it. - You want it? You want this? - What are you doing? - You want this? - Are you mocking me? - Yes, yes, I'm mocking you. - It's my jacket. You will damage it. - This, this jacket... - Be careful. - Is my jacket. And this, this is mine also. Yes, huh? My jacket, my suit, my land, my, my fatherland, my, my party, my, my Poland, my, my Czechoslovakia. Mine, mine, mine, I will have it all! - [Emily] Mom, you can't. (light dramatic music) - This jacket, it's not yours. This, this jacket it is... It's a joke, it's a costume. It's the sort of thing they sell in fancy dress shops now. None of it should be yours. (Helga sighs) - This is yours. My mother. My poor bloody mother, she, she is yours. (somber music) - I want, I want a hand on my daughter. Oh, Mousey. (Traudi crying) - Let me go. - No. - No, please, please, take your hands off me. Please, let me go. Let me go. - Give me another kiss? (floor creaking) See you later, Mousey. See you later. (floor creaking) (haunting music) (door creaking) (Helga sighs) - Mom, wait. - Leave her. She just needs time. - I've always left her, I don't want to leave her. Don't just carry on as if none of this had happened. I came all this way here to see you. (Helga thudding) Mom! (Beth crying) - Gran? Are you okay? (Helga chuckling) (Helga sighs) (haunting music continues) Please can we just go home now? - Come on, Mom. Let's go home. (Beth sniffling) (Emily sighing) (haunting music continues) (gentle music) (bells chiming)
