I feel you guys went a little overboard Akash, you may feel pity for that boy... but then Kamini? - Phew! - Who's that? What? Oh! You're new here, right? You must not have watched Kamini's previous episodes Dude, the girl who acted unconscious pranking people. That's her! Oh. That's our Kamini? Our Kamini? I guess our new editor will woo her soon No! No! I know her already that's why I said so Go ahead. Flirt with her I just wanted to know if she acts really well. That's all. I swear Acting? Dude, she just won't stop once she gets started At one point even if we plead her to stop out of sympathy, she won't! Even I'll crack up and laugh at some point but Kamini? She is quite spontaneous, sharp and bold! God! A sadist! Dude, haven't you moved on since that dumping incident? What dumping incident? Well, that... Well, the day Mr. Dumped got dumped... and that dumping was witnessed by his friends... Dude, he is asking and it's only fair I let him know Sunny Leone? Yes. Historical movie! There are sword fights in it Historical film, my foot! Sunny Leone films are mostly porn that we delete from Browser history after watching Hey guys, morning! Hello sir So Gowri, is everything packed up? Almost, sir. We are on it What's that? A small correction in the "Gotcha! Gotcha!" latest episode Come on, guys! We've been slowly shifting our office over a week What's with the last minute corrections? Today's the last day We gotta empty the building by today evening. It's a court order Almost done See, our boss is very particular. It's a prestige issue If we don't vacate by today evening... other channels will make a news out of this, and spoil our reputation - Ok, sir - Right? Why is he carrying a long face? Is he missing this building already? Well, sir...the day Mr. Dumped got dumped... and that dumping was witnessed by his friends... Shut up, Gowri! Hey, where is Kamini? ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” What happened? Had a nightmare? Indeed mom! - A bad dream! - What was it about? I was wearing lot of bangles in my hand... and with flowers in my head... and Mehendi in my hands Top of it, I was wearing a red colored Saree Red colored Saree? Did it set off a bull and did it charge towards you? A bull? Tell me what happened then? What more do you expect to happen? That's all and I woke me up Crap! It's 11! So, seeing yourself in a Saree is a nightmare to you? Move! Won't you wake me up on time? Look at her room! Eww! It's her birthday and look when she wakes up! It's 11 am already That too after having set an alarm! Dressed traditionally and stepping into a temple. Who else would call it a nightmare? Instead of getting married and leading a family life with husband and kids... you work in a TV station, playing pranks on people! I bought you a new Saree, hoping you'll wear it at least today But you? You get into that same circus attire of yours! I named you 'Sudhandhira kodi'(Free soul) And what do you do? You give yourself an alias 'Kamini!' (Bold and beautiful) Wonder when you'll make your mom proud Mom, tune into our channel My program is airing So all this while my words were falling in deaf ears? I heard you. Now, increase the volume "Gotcha! Gotcha!" Rekha, come here What happened? Felt like something bit me What's gonna bite you in this place? Indeed! Something bit me too What is it? I don't know Kamini! Kamini! Kamini! ’Due to breakage in gigantic pipes..’ ’..there is a delay in water supply..’ Look at her Dressed up beautifully in a Saree... well groomed and beautiful like a doll. No roaming business Look how graceful she looks Why don't you try something like that? Instead... 'Hi! We are from #TAG TV' 'Look over there! See here! See the camera?! 'Wave your hands!' 'Now say 'Gotcha! Gotcha!'" What is this? And top of it you keep bringing up Feminism all the time Of course! Tell me what is feminism? I do know Is it? Explain me Well, it is...yes! One extra idly you have after satisfying your hunger belongs to someone else Mom! That's Communism! Communism? And she thinks she just delivered a dialogue like actor Vijay! - Are you already done eating? - Come on, mom! You can't even differentiate between Communism and Feminism But what's that got to do with food? Does Feminism preach you to eat less? Becoming a news anchor isn't a big deal, mom We must not be the one who reads out the headlines We must be the headlines! Don't you know, mom? I took up this media job because I hate to sit and work at a desk Sucking up to suited up bosses isn't my kind attitude, Lakshmi I have no problem you being the headlines But just that the headlines must be a good one, Kamini It must make me feel proud about you I don't want to judged as a single parent who didn't raise her daughter well Oh My God Enough mom! Now what's your problem? News Anchoring is a better job, right? Fine, I'll become a News anchor. It's a silly matter, mom You? Anchoring? My foot! You can't even speak four lines in proper Tamil accent Hello! Challenge? - Wanna bet? - I'll lay one slap! First, stop betting on everything! It'll become an addiction What the hell? Look at your dress! Even while drying our inners we dont let others see it But you show it off wearing it! Such a drama queen! Let's put a 'To be continued...' to our serial fight Next Episode, tomorrow Deepak already called me. I must go now I have to pick him up Ok mommy Let me know if it's heavy. Do not push It's been hardly a month since I joined... and already we are vacating the office! Turn - This way - Yes. Hold it properly. Why are we vacating in a hurry? Well, bro... this is a rented building Our boss offered to buy the building but the owner refused Our boss too refused to vacate Hold like this The owner pressed charges On one hand, the case in the court... on the other hand, our boss started constructing a new building in Mandaveli It's still under construction but then... the court has already passed an order to vacate this building. And so here we are Last time I did something similar was during... my School annual day, lifting benches Should we handle luggage at the new place too? Whose charger is it? That belongs to Mr. Dumped. Leave it there Mr. Dumped! Why do you guys call Sugumar as Mr. Dumped? Well, it's a boring flashback. Forget it It's ok. Just tell me. I'll edit the boring part Boring flashback Initially, we tried our hands on every show We did a lot of shows but we weren't getting that break and recognition That's when Kamini came up with "Gotcha! Gotcha!" Jeni became a news reader We also became famous The TRP rating rocketed sky high for our show "Hey you little angry birdie!" "Don't you make me desperate" "And when I look at you..." "stop mesmerizing me!" "Hey you little angry birdie!" I could see Kamini and Sugumar getting closer day by day. I felt it was overwhelming I expected Sugumar will propose her first But Kamini proposed Deepak by kissing and hugging him on the streets Even then, Sugumar didn't leave her The very next day that incident took place Kamini... Kamini... I have something to tell you What is it? Are you quitting the job? Dude stop! - Look, Sugumar - Then what? - Do you have any new idea for our show? - He is a goner! Well, I don't know how it happened... but I think I'm in love with you Kamini - You're in love with me? - Yes, Kamini I gave it a good thought I'm indeed in love Take out the camera - What are you up to? - Wait and watch We don't even have guts to ask extra sides when we are at a restaurant Where as, our fellow is proposing her! This is history You drink and are a spoilt brat You are arrogant. You bet at every possible opportunity Do you think a lot of them will like a girlfriend with such qualities? But I love you, Kamini Sugumar... stop kidding There is a limit for everything Exactly. There is a limit! We have crossed the limits of a friendship long ago, Kamini When you hop on my bike instead of others' bike... You have no idea how happy it makes me, Kamini As I drive the bike, you fall asleep on my shoulders I feel extra weight... but the feel it gives me... Whoa! It feels like heaven on earth, Kamini! Don't you feel the same way, Kamini? What nonsense, Sugumar? Something's wrong with you Indeed Kamini. Everything's wrong with me I have gone mad - I can't live without you, Kamini - Just shut up! Why is she yelling so bad? Are you nuts? If a girl rides with a guy in his bike during the night... you call it love? - Ok, people are watching - Just shut up! I chose your bike over others bike because I love your bike! Not because I love you! Kamini... other day you tasted food from my plate? I would have been starving! Your food must have arrived earlier and hence I took a bite You call that love? You sported a horn on my head while posing for a group photo. That one? Cut the crap! And that made you fell in love? Did you bring me all the way to this crappy tea shop at this hour to propose? Look here, girl! This shop is my hard work! Better mind you words! You! What's with the rude tone? Who do you think you are? You better show some respect! Or else what? I could be the next chief minister or prime minister Get lost you monkey-face! Not the time. I'm pissed off! You better step back Sorry. Please get back inside. Please. Sorry Forget it, Kamini. Come, I'll drop you home You think I'll ride with you after all this? Get lost! Kamini, look here. Listen to me. Kamini...Kamini... - Calm down, Kamini - Just get lost! - Just come with me, Kamini - I'll book a cab and go safe Kamini, please! - What happened? - Wait He saw us! Kamini! Kamini, look "Gotcha! Gotcha!" " Gotcha! Gotcha!" prank. Look over there. Hey, Gowri! Gowri! Gowri! - Say "Gotcha! Gotcha!" - Just say it Look, Kamini fell for my prank! Come on! - "Gotcha! Gotcha!" - "Gotcha! Gotcha!" Come on, guys "Gotcha! Gotcha!" "Gotcha! Gotcha!" It was just for fun Kamini. Come on Sugumar's a smart guy! Thanks to us. If we hadn't responded to him... Kamini would have unleashed hell on Sugumar! So that's how Sugumar got the nickname 'Mr. Dumped?' Wait editor, the story ain't over Later, Kamini and Deepak got into a relationship Deepak could have kept his mouth shut but... he revealed what happened the other day was for real Holy guacamole! Then? Greetings! I'm Gowri Myself and Deepak were crossing the very place on the very day Sugumar took Kamini out to propose her This hurt her a lot thus a silly issue became a major issue Myself, Madhavan Nair, the owner of the tea shop where the incident took place I'm Jenifer. Kamini's friend She made a special Mr.Dumped episode and released it on Valentine's day The episode was a hit Our people have weird taste! Even today, somewhere, someone shares this video on social media And since then everyone in our office address Sugumar as Mr. Dumped Poor fellow She went too overboard in the name of getting back at Sugumar That's Kamini for you She does what she wants If she places a bet then she will do anything to win it Deepak is in a relationship with her and I wonder what hell he is undergoing ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O Godess our protector O powerful Goddess” ”O powerful Goddess Shakthi Shower Your grace” ”Shower Your grace” Good morning, Jeni baby Good morning?

Look over there I was on my way to write my UPSC exam I passed the prelims at my place And came to Chennai on that day for main exams I was searching for the centre Instead of going to the exam I helped you thinking you were really hurt I got late for the exam and missed it Again I have to start all over from the beginning and clear prelims one by one I lost a year because of you! What? Since you missed you an ordinary exam... you took revenge by doing this to me? Come again! An ordinary exam? You make it sound so easy! There are protests going on for having and banning exams Students are made to travel 1000 of miles to write exams Worse, there are dress codes while entering a exam hall! In the name of security check girls students dress were tore before... they step inside exam halls! There are girls hanging themselves for failing in entrance exams And everything is just a game to you? Your prank didn't impact me much even after I missed my exam I let it go thinking after all it's just a prank you pulled on me But then one day, an incident changed everything for me What happened, mom? Nothing, dear. Its so hot I am exhausted Come on, mom. We are almost reaching the bus stand Dear! - Oh my God! - Mom! Mom! Mom, what happened? Excuse me, please come here Mom, please wake up - What happened? Did she faint? - I don't know what happened She fainted all of a sudden Please help. Let's get her to sit somewhere Please, consider her as your mother and help her. God will bless you Excuse me! Wait, this is a prank show, right? Where are the hidden cameras? Behind that car or somewhere behind that tree? Are you nuts? Can't you see an elderly lady has fainted? Move! Lift her. First, let's get her to sit under a shade No uncle, it's a TV show. I have watched it quite often Can't you differentiate? Splash some water on her face Excuse me... It's a prank show! Oh, come on. It's just a prank Kamini, that was one hell of an acting! It's just the prank show Its a prank! Show 'Gotcha! Gotcha!' - Relax - Relax - Would you like some water? - Don't cry - Come on. Don't cry - You look beautiful with the cap Look at the camera and say 'Gotcha! Gotcha!' 'Gotcha! Gotcha!' 'Gotcha! Gotcha!' Relax. Ok, that's enough. Cut! Cut! None of them here takes anything seriously! People take everything so easy Nowadays, in our whole body, only thumbs are working overtime That is using the mobile all the time! Social media and smart phones have turned people in to buffoons Pranking, trolling, pulling leg is all everyone does these days Facebook and Twitter are filled mostly with fake ids Login and all you find are memes People bath with a bucket of ice in the name of #Ice bucket challenge But do they even know why? They say it's fun! #Freethenipple! Women are protesting in social media so that they can show of their breasts... by making #Freethenipple trending Back in old days women protested to hide their breast And women today are protesting to show it off A stupid medicine student throws off a puppy from the tenth floor He shoots it and posts it in the internet. Why? For fun! A guy clicks selfie on railway track while train is approaching and dies. Why? For cheap likes, comments and some followers! How cheap! Why click selfie with a corpse? Just for fun! In the name of fun people do all this... and as a result every house has kids turning into rogues Blah! Blah! Blah! So, we’re the reason behind all this... Is that what you're saying? It was just a prank show Absurd Prank show. My foot! When my mom fainted on the streets, the guy who came to help stepped back! Why? Because of your show! If you play unconscious and prank people... then who will save people when they faint for real? Already people are confused struggling to differentiate wounded... and drunk people on road On top of that, you guys! 'Look, see the camera? Say 'Gotcha! Gotcha!' You guys deserve a tight slap and proper class! When you deceive someone you know, then its called a prank! Playing prank on a stranger is called Nuisance! And that is what you guys are doing Do not misuse the freedom you have It's not my job to change all these This is not a revenge While driving when someone overtakes me and jumps the signal... I just stare at them in a way that they don't find out I am just an ordinary person That is all I can do We have only one chance I'm still unable to complete those exams Then I started working here Kamini! Do you wanna see me spend the whole night alone and naked in this building? We need more booze! Yes! More booze! Hello, Jeni's father? She is drunk and lying wasted at office. Please, come pick her up How much will five mutton biriyani cost? Like you did to me, I also acted as if I was fighting for life Thought you'd save me. Instead you hit me in the head with the rod When I woke up in the hospital, I escaped the eyes of the police to rush and check on you! I thought I'll throw your dress inside and escape But to my surprise you were already at the gate I expected you won't give a damn and walk out naked in the streets Well, not bad. You turned out to be better than what I thought you were I... I hope you understood whatever I said What did you understand? Freedom is not for free It needs lot of discipline "Oh Moon! Will you come out from the Sky?" "I need a pair to play" "Before anyone sees on the Earth I'll send you back early in the morning" You sang it really well Did you practice music professionally? No sir My mother's a good singer I got it from her Very good Why do you close your eyes while singing? It's natural when you loose yourself while singing Some girls do it while singing and some while kissing I had mentioned it in one of my song lyrics So, now... The industry has changed The heroes have started writing lyrics The music director sings all the songs in a movie album Indeed, sir I have written more than thousand songs Even my plight is the same You got to look for opportunities, get them and then become a chorus singer When will you become a leading singer? Sir, you can open gates for me Of course, I can do it I got contacts But why should I do it? I don't get you, sir Well, nothing... Like how you closed your eyes while singing... Likewise close your eyes for a little while But then, isn't this wrong? Decency and desire cant prevail together darling "First we carry an attitude..."
