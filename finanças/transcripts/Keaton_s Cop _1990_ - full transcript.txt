Shit, Jake, they jumped. [Chuckles] Supposedly, those two jumpers worked for big mama. [Upbeat music continues] We picking up Jimmy? Ease up, Gabe, huh? You're too tense. Here. Have some cherry candy. I'm on a diet. You need to go to the doctor and have your ulcers checked. I haven't had time. Get time. I don't wanna break in a new partner. Hmm. Sure. [Cars honking] I see Nick coplas got hit in Miami. He was playing golf. What's my horoscope say? Oh. Says here you ought to maintain Patience and understanding. Your sign and libra's are in conflicting patterns. Speaking of libras, there's Marsha waiting with Jimmy. Is that what you mean? [Laughing] That's a conflicting pattern. She really lights up a room doesn't she? How's my big man today, huh? Hi, dad! Great, mmm! Morning, Marsha. Can we go to the circus on Saturday? Mom says I can. Marsha: As long as he's home by six o'clock. You got it. Hi, uncle Jake! Good morning, my man. Have a cherry candy. Mike, aren't you forgetting something? What's that, Marsha? The check. My child support. Check's in the mail, Marsha. Bullshit. You said that last month. Look, I can't help it if the mail is late. We are going to be late. If it's not here by tomorrow, I am notifying the court. Well, why don't you just do that? Whose wagon in your driveway? It's none of your damn business. It's uncle Dwayne! You don't have an uncle Dwayne! [Horn honking] Uncle Dwayne! Uncle Dwayne! You son of a bitch! Oh, I'm coming up in the world. Uncle Dwayne! Well, lookie here. You're such an asshole! Mike, come on, the kid's gonna be late for school. Yeah, dad, I'm gonna be late. [Dogs barking] Are you screwing that guy in front of my kid? Why not? He'll learn how a real man does it. Is that right? Where do you think you're going? [Rousing music] You can't go in my house! Goddamn it! You can't go in there! Mike! Where's my dad going? Uh, here, kid. Read the comic section. Help you think funny. Parents can be strange sometime. Jake! He's going nuts! He'll kill him! You gotta-- whoaa! Jimmy. I think your uncle Dwayne was a libra. Oh my god! There goes the circus. [Plays "wild in the streets"] You wanna live in the streets, streets the streets, streets come on, come on let's get wild wild in the streets everybody get wild in the streets [typewriter clinking] Announcer: There will be a trivial pursuit game following lunch on the veranda. Where's Louis Keaton's room? Upstairs, room two-oh-three. Announcer: ...In the recreation room immediately afterwards. She's asked me to remind the men to show up. Hit me. How much have I got? Keaton: You got nineteen. Hit me. [Door closes] Mister Keaton, are you cheating mister goldberg again? Why bother? The putz takes a hit on nineteen. Bad boy. How much is this? [Door closes] Too much. Is the game over? I'm taking a pee! [Elevator music] Nurse, where's room 203? Oh it's down the hall to your left. Thanks. Okay. [Suspenseful music] [Gunshot] [Groan] [City noises] We just got word that Mike's been arrested. They're bringing him in now! He threw one of Marsha's boyfriends out a window. It's lucky he didn't kill him! Here's my boy now. Look at this! I really hit the jackpot this time. What the hell'd you throw him out the window for? It was an accident. He jumped! An a.C... With him, it's a hobby. [Laughing] He jumped? Jesus! We got him. Chief down in Metro says you owe US one. One? We may owe him five before the week is out. This guy doesn't arrest people. He throws them out windows. You okay? Oh I hope he didn't hurt his wrist when he threw the guy. Hey look, what am I gonna do with you? Spencer, he's been under a lot of stress. Besides, that bum he threw out the window has a rap sheet from here to Chicago. Well look at this, he's got a lawyer. Hey tell me, what'd you do? Hey tell me, what'd you do? Did you check the guy before or after you threw him out the window? So I blew it, I'm sorry! Sorry? Is that all you can say? Am I gonna say that to the da? You're sorry? Do you know that your wife filed a grievance with the social welfare? Tell them anything you want. You can also take this badge and stick it. Look at that badge. Who said anything about a badge? The badge. Should I say anything about the badge? Did I say hey, turn in your badge? E, Eddie, what did I say? Did you hear it? No. No, sir. I rember the times when you took care of your guys. When you really cared. You really cared about them. When you ran interference for 'em. First you're a lawyer, now you're a diplomat. Now look there's an old guy shot at a retirement home. You and Mike, go down and get 'em. What about the da? I'll take care of the da. What about the social? I'll take care of everything! Now get outta here! Gimme the badge! Hey, what are you two? Dance team? Come on! Out on the street and catch some bad guys! How are you gonna tell your grandkids you're as good as dirty Harry? Three more months and I'm out of this zoo. Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Can we have a statement? Lieutenant, can we get in there and get some pictures? Why don't you come up to the lake this weekend with Sally and me? Do some fishing and drink beer. I don't like fish. Well drink beer and piss your blues away. That I can do. You should find yourself a girlfriend. I got a dog that loves me unconditionally. What have we got? How's your time with Jimmy? That kid really loves you. The only time I see him is when Marsha cuts out for the weekend with some drunk she met in the bar the night before. Then, find a nice girl and fight for the kid. Homicide. Can we come in? Second floor, sir. [Phone ringing] He was such a nice man. Miss Watson: Oh Mrs. Norris, now sit down. I want you to take this, all right? Poor man, he'll never learn to count. Awww. [Inaudible] Miss Watson? Yes? You are miss Watson? Yes. Oh. Homicide. We'd like to ask you a few questions, please. Could you just please wait outside? Did I do something wrong? No, now you just get some rest. If she was a witness, we'd like to talk to her. Could you please just wait outside? It's okay, Agnes, it's all right. It's okay. She's not, she just saw mister goldberg's body. I didn't catch your names. The officer said you talked to the suspect. I gave a description to the officer. Could you give it to US again? Miss Watson, you've got a million phone calls. What should I tell them? I'll be right there. Why? Repetition sometimes helps US with new details. Look, would you deal with it? Okay. Look, it's been a very traumatic day. I have seventy patients and twenty visitors. They are very upset. [Whimpering] The victim, mister goldberg, what was he like? He was polite. He was a retired tailor. A sweet kind gentle man who was confined to a wheelchair. Miss Watson, nobody heard the shot. That means the killer most likely used a silencer. Now sweet gentle kind old men don't get bumped off with silencers. I'm sorry. I don't know about such things. That's why we ask the questions. Now what did the suspect say to you? He asked for room two-oh-three. Louis Keaton's room. Would you take US to mister Keaton's room? Sure why not? [Knocking] There's no one home! It's Susan, mister Keaton! Some detectives just wanna ask you a few questions. Tell 'em to take a cab, get lost. Look he's really upset, can we do this another time? Mister Keaton, detective Mike gable, homicide. We wanna talk to you. I had nothing to do with this. You ain't pinning this hit on me! Mister Keaton, please open the door. I promise no one's going to hurt you. I can't find my slippers. You got a passkey? Yeah. [Unlocking] Be gentle with him, he's very sick. [Glass breaks] I'll handle it, let me handle it. You're not gonna handle anything. He's old and sick. Louis? Jake barber. Jakey? Yeah. [Solemn music] Jakey barber. I thought I'd never see you again. How have you been? I'm fine. You're looking good. How's Sally? Still got those beautiful legs? [Laughs] I thought you were in for life. What are you doing here? I kept my nose clean. At my age, what threat am I to society? [Laughs] How come a man was killed in your room? Who's that? Oh, this is my partner. Mike gable. Mike, say hello to an old friend of mine, Louis Keaton. What were you in for Louis? Where did you get this bum? Mister Keaton, I want you to lie down. I need to check your pressure and pulse. He's healthy, he's healthy. What were you in for Louis? Murder one! No! Out of this room immediately! Stop it, hey. Listen, Mike, Mike. Uh, I'm out of the cherry candies. Huh? Go out and get me some, will ya? Please. Sure. As for you, in the bed now! I don't wanna get in the bed. Now! I don't wanna get in the bed! Get in the bed, get in the bed. Thank you. Stop giving this lady a tough time. This joint is worse than the pen. I, I don't need my pulse checked. I need a drink! Louis. What are you doing here? My ticker is bad. They let me out. Prison's too crowded for corpses. Have you got any idea who pulled the trigger? [Pumping] How should I know? The guy was a tailor. Hell, if he, he makes suits the way he played cards, half the island was out after him. Louis, the killer's after you. Be straight with me. How well did you know Nick coplas? He was Stan teskog's man. Well, he got rubbed out yesterday in Miami while he was playing golf. What's that got to do with me? Whoever got coplas means business. They also took out his muscle with him. Mister Keaton's pressure's too high. He's gotta get some rest. Please don't keep him too long. Don't listen to her. Stay as long as you like. Naw, she's, she's right. I'll come back tomorrow. Good seeing you again, Louis. Oh and Louis. When I come back, I want some answers. Next time, bring Sally, will you? I'll be back. Now that they're all gone, how about you and I go to an oyster bar, some beers, and then if the moon comes up-- I told you before Louis. Our malpractice insurance doesn't cover it. Nighty night. [Laughs] You stay in bed and I'll send someone to sweep up the glass. [Door opens] [Phone rings] Uh miss, I'd like to ask a few-- is mister Keaton going back to jail? He said he was gonna teach me how to play gin rummy. Don't you worry, miss. Everything'll be fine. He's resting now, Mrs. Gilbert but you can visit with him later, okay? How long has Keaton been here? About three months. He's an excellent patient. Quite the uh ladies' man. Yeah, Louis's always been lucky with the ladies. Does he get many visitors? None that I'm aware of. But we do keep lists so I can check them for you. Oh thank you very much, that's very thoughtful. About Mike. Detective gable. That man is rude. What sign are you? [Laughs] Libra. Why? Well see, being a detective, I have to ask those questions. He's really a great guy once you get to know him. [Singing "my old Kentucky home"] We will sing one song for we will sing one song for the old Kentucky home for the old Kentucky home far away [suspenseful music] How long have you known Keaton? We grew up in the same neighborhood. His father and mine worked the shrimp boats together. I became a cop and he became a bookmaker. Any idea who might be after him? No. Louis was a powerful guy in his day. With him out there free, he's makin a lot of people nervous. Let's hurry huh? I have to take a leak. Why don't you go back there? They got a bathroom. It's hard for me to take a leak in a strange place. Ah, you're getting soft, Jake. [Suspenseful music] Long distance. I want the number of Pete kosta. Kosta with a k. K-o-s-t-a. He lives in the Irish section of town. What do you mean you don't have an Irish section? You people look and I'll wait. Jake: Two weeks ago, Artie vargas, Tommy cantor's bookkeeper, takes a dive off a New York high rise. Then coplas gets in Miami. Now they want Keaton. Oh. Whole world's out of order. Who was cantor? He ran this island. [Peeing] Ah. Before your time, he controlled the gambling and the broads. Keaton was Tommy's right hand man. Cantor was like a father to Louis. But Louis was never part of the muscle. Why the murder one rap? [Zipping] Well, I think he was covering for Tommy cantor. He was a sick man. He would have died in prison. Would've killed him. Louis's a very honorable guy. You know the kind, uh, the old code of honor, something you don't find today. Yeah well to me he's just another con. I say we stick with Keaton. We'll find our killer. You should put the nurse under protective custody. She saw the killers. [Seagull squawking] [Rock music] We don't get Keaton, they're gonna get US. How we gonna get him? They probably got guards around him now. Screw the guards. Them I can handle. It's the people that hired US I'm worried about, capiche? Oh look at this pussy here. Mmm. What do you need to look at trash like that for? I ain't good enough for ya? Well maybe if you hit the right guy, you'd get what you want. [Scoffing] I'll get the right guy. Business before pleasure. [Suspenseful music] Mike, let me bring Louis out. You rubbed him the wrong way. I'm not waiting in the car for no ex-con. I'll compromise. You get Keaton, I get the nurse. Fine. [Seagulls squawking] [Plays "wild in the streets"] Wild in the streets wild in the streets let's tear this town down all right oh [engine stops] You take the front, I'll cover the back. What if there's cops? If they get in the way, take them out. And I don't mean dancing. [Suspenseful music] Look Louis, this is no time to be stubborn. What hotel are you taking me to? It's a fine hotel. You know I can't tell you that for security. You son of a bitch. I got rights. This is kidnapping you know? Those city of punt hotels are full of cockroaches, rats, bedbugs... Quit your bitching. You stay here and you'll be a dead man. Ready? Bye mister Keaton. Women in unison: Goodbye! Bye girls! Unison: Bye! [Women chattering over each other] Peters, take the lead. [Suspenseful music] Cops! Shotgun! [Gunshots] Louis, watch it! [Screams, groans] Everybody back! Jake's hit! Everybody get down! Get out of the way! Pull those phone lines! I'll cover the back! Move it! [Screaming] Call nine-eleven, tell 'em officer down. [Gunshot] The phone isn't working! Damn! Jake! Mike. Yeah? You got any cherry, cherry, cherry candy? Sure, Jack, sure. [Shallow breathing] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, kid. I crapped out on you. Jakey. How is he? He's dead. [Gunshots] [Screaming] [Suspenseful music] Is there another way out of here besides that door? The cellar. Move it! [Gunshots] [Glass shattering] Follow me! This way. Come on, fuck! Suck on this! [Whimpering] Pig shit! Hmm! Come here, bitch. No, no! No! Help me! Go, down, down, down! [Screaming] Please don't hurt me! Shut up, bitch! [Sobbing] I'm not gonna hurt you. Shhh, I like you. [Tires screeching] [Gunshots] [Glass shattering] [Gunshots] Did you hit anybody? No. If we keep this up, he's not gonna make it. You're hit. Here comes the cavalry. Now it's my turn. You two don't move. What are you gonna do? [Police sirens] It's payback time. [Gunshots] [Screaming] Adios, sweetheart! Not the baby! Hold it! [Gunshots] [Groaning] [Screaming] [Sirens approaching] Hey! [Honking horn] Move that fucking Van! Hold it right there! Get out of my fucking way! Move it! [Gunshot] [Explosion] Move it! You must have hit the gas tank. Hell, I'm not that damn lucky. Have the lab boys check the wreckage out. The receptionist is gonna be okay. Have you had a tetanus shot? I don't want a tetanus shot. Give it to him anyhow. Does Sally know? My wife is over there now. Just remember this is my case. And I work alone. How is he? Considering the condition of his heart, he's fine. You might just say this excitement did him some good. You're okay. Maybe I should take up skydiving. Hell right now, you're gonna take up talking. I don't feel like talking. Shit. That's the first intelligent thing you've said all day. You can get dressed now. You know, your recent popularity has caused US a lot of trouble. Now listen, Keaton, I know you don't like the-- I don't dislike cops. I dislike him. He saved your life. Who asked him to? If you weren't there, I'd be dead. What about detective barber and that young man? His name was Diaz. Look, Keaton. I know you don't like me and the feeling is mutual. But we got one thing in common and that's Jake. You're gonna help me find whoever's behind this. Jake was my pal before you were born. I don't need a two-bit detective telling me what to do. Look you're still in my protective custody. Now get him out of here. Don't let him out of your sight. All right, get him out. What about me? You're no longer a witness. I'll take ya home. Thanks. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. In the old days, Tommy cantor and I lived here. We had the whole eighth floor. [String music] Ah. You guys paying for this? That's correct? I take back what I said. Oh Tommy would have loved this. [Laughing] [Suspenseful music] He's in room eight hundred. I uh, I don't know how to thank you. [Soft music] I'm really sorry about your partner. It must be very painful for you. Yeah. Look about the first day, I was rude. I'm sorry, I would like to see you again. [Laughs] You don't have to answer it. I'll be right back. [Door opens] [Door closes] [Whistles] Now look, there's an officer in the elevator. One at the door. I'm in the other bedroom. And Stan's covering the city, all right? What did you say? [Classical music] I said there's an officer at the elevator. One at the door-- that's what I thought you said. How about a look at the other room? I might be nicer. How much is this room? It's three hundred dollars. How much is that room? Just a hundred. I'll take this one. [Laughs] I don't wanna cheat the city. You guys hungry? We could go for a pizza. Pizza? Are you kidding? You cops need a little protein. Hel, hello, room service? How do you like your steaks? [Soft music] Jake seemed like such a nice man. Well he was the best. I'm gonna miss him. Mike, what's gonna happen to Keaton? I'm not sure. I hate to say it but at this moment, I don't care. Three innocent people are dead because of him. And the people he's involved with. And I want them. But Louis's a special person. Now I know about his background. Everybody at the home loved him. He was kind and generous. [Laughs] Most cons are. That's the cop in you talking, Mike. Maybe. But you know, I think it's time you went for a swim. I hope you're kidding. Mike! No! Come on! This water's too wet! [Splashing] [Romantic music] [Shower trickling] Come on in, there's room for both of US. Come on! [Laughter] [Waves crashing] This is absolutely the most beautiful night. [Moaning] Oh, oh Michael. [Birds chirping] [Sniffing] Hmm, I think I'm in the wrong house. Good morning! Good morning! I like your dog! What's his name? Name's blue. But he's red! He don't know. [Laughs] Come on, blue. [Phone ringing] I gotta get the phone. Yo? Gable? Good morning, lieutenant. Keaton's at the galvez. Get him out of there! What the hell's he doing at the galvez? Get over there right away. Right away, you understand. The guy is up to fifty four hundred dollars! Four hundred dollars worth of steaks! He's got rice pudding. I don't know what the hell he's doing with it. He's nuts! He sent to Italy for mustard. You understand? All right, all right, I'm on my way. I'll be there in a half hour. Did you find cantor's files? Spencer: Jake had great records. Haze is over there with them now. Get that bum out of bed, you understand? Get him out, put him in the cellar! I don't care what you do with him. Hurry up, the city's going broke! I'm on my way. Come, blue, that's a boy! That's a boy! Are you thirsty? [Barking] Me too, come on. Did you get your coffee? Yeah, thanks. The house looks great. You're welcome. Mmm. I gotta go pick up Keaton. How is he? Oh he's fine. Seems the ex-con conned the city out of a suite at the galvez. Last night was really incredible. That it was. I'm gonna be late. Louis won't mind. [Barking] [String music] This is lovely. Well, I think we'll stay a few more days just for you. [Dinging] Morning. Um good morning, Mike. Keaton? Hehe yeah. Honey, I don't feel good. I told you not to go to the buffet line twice. Well good morning, boys. Damn, it's Mike. [Coughing] Where's the big time spender? Taking a shower. Shower? Lieutenant call? Yeah, he called. Well he ordered this. When we weren't looking. [Coughing] Honest, Mike, we didn't know anything. Yeah, Mike, we cut him off. Was that before or after he ordered the silk shirts? Would you like some coffee? Yeah, something to eat, Mike? Sure, why not? Must be food here for at least six people. Six? Twelve! Twelve. As much as I dislike the son of a bitch, he does have a certain flair. [Door closes] Keaton? Keaton? Where are you? Keaton: I'm getting dressed. [Sighing] [Suspenseful music] Get your feet off my bed. You think you're smart don't ya? [Sprays] Ah, smart enough to know that a sixty dollar Cologne is better than a two-dollar toilet water. [Laughs] I told you yesterday. I'm a big boy. I'll make you a deal. Tell me about cantor's people. It'll stay with me. All I want is the guy behind Jake's murder. Can't help you. Get ready, we're moving. [Dialing] Haze. Haze, it's gable. You got anything for me? [Suspenseful music] Ray, can you verify? Good man. [Gunshot] [Groan] I want a list of Tommy cantor's associates. Right. Right. We're moving. You've worn out your welcome here. Cockroaches. Big ones. I'm gonna miss this joint. They got a great men's shop here. Yup. I bet you will. We'll use Keaton's door. [Suspenseful music] Look out! [Gunshots] [Groan] Keaton: Come here! Come here I'll kill that son of a -- Mike: Shut up and stay down! [Dramatic music] [Gunshots] Hey, this ain't no freeway, mister! Hey! Hold it. [Clicking] Too bad. [Gunshot] [Glass shattering] [Groaning] [Police sirens] Medics are on the way. Hang in there, kid. You. You're gonna talk and you're gonna talk fast. Or my report's gonna say that killer didn't miss. He took my bullet. The two that got Jake, al sims and Rick Dante. Those names familiar to you? We figure they were independent contractors. What about these? Ring any bells? Yeah, they all work for Tommy cantor. So what? For the last ninety days, all of them have been hit. [Laughs] No one hits Pete costa. Oh yeah? Well, they got him and Alberto monzay in the same Chinese restaurant. Look at that list. Aside from the fact that you were close to cantor, there must be something else you had in common. Yeah we all liked Chinese food. Look here, you ten cent hood. You don't work with this program, you're going back to the can. Look, since they let me out of the joint, I've been cooped up in a rest home with old farts. Put me out on the street, two days, with gable, I'll get you the answer. Are you jerking US off? I got a debt to pay. Jakey. Jakey and that, that nice kid who took a slug meant for me. I pay my debts. You got forty-eight hours. That list you gave me. Two names short. Lennie fontaine and Archie gish. Didn't trust me. Well, we figured if you give US the names, you're being straight. Lennie fontaine is still alive. We couldn't find an Archie gish. He is a she. Don't watch me! Watch where you're going! Get on a ferry! Archie's real name is pauline. Her mother, Rita gish, was a big time madame. She was a tough broad. This pimp tries to move in on Rita. So one night she gives him a personal invite. Fucks his brains out. Fucks his brains out. Next morning, he wakes up in bed... His two bodyguards laying [ferry honks horn] What a beautiful day! What happened to the pimp? He became one of our bartenders. He also knocked up Rita that night. Rita had pauline. How did pauline get the name Archie? And what was she to Tommy? Pauline developed fast, if you know what I mean. Became Tommy's mistress. She liked to, she liked to read the, the Archie comics so much, Tommy nicknamed her Archie. She became his moll at fifteen. Just like her mother. She became tough, very, very tough. She was a real ball breaker. You know I always liked to ride the ferry. How does that help US find Archie? If I know Archie, she's on the island, working on the island. New name maybe but she's on the island. Well what the fuck are we doing on this ferry? It's going to the mainland. I told you, I like to ride the ferry. We're getting close. The mainland is nearby. Get in the car. [Laughs] You're too serious, kid. [Horn honks] How close were you and Tommy? Tommy was like a father to jakey and me. He used to call jakey the prodigal son because he became a cop. Jake told me you went to prison for Tommy. Is that true? Tommy was old. He was losing it. Everybody became ambitious. Even Archie. They told me if I was to take the rap, I'd get three to five at most. [Engine starts] Who sold you out? Archie. When Tommy died, she took over. [Gulls squawking] [Car pulls away] All right, let's go! All right! Be careful. Don't run over any porpoises. Take twenty first to q. For a cop, you're a lousy driver. [Boat horns in distance] What about lennie fontaine? Faggot. No juice. Archie's the key. You gotta find Archie. [Suspenseful music] Archie: If you can't get him, I'll get you. Did you get a security guard at Tommy's place? Good. I know Keaton, he's checking out my place right now. Keep in touch and make sure you don't miss this time. Oh, Keaton, you bastard. [Car approaches] What the hell are they doing here? What is this place? Are you kidding? This is Tommy cantor's home. He built it. This is a historic site. John Dillinger was a punk compared to Tommy cantor. And they made that theater there a, a tourist attraction. Move it along, pops. This is private property. I used to know a guy who lived here. Yeah, well, he don't live here no more. Now you're interrupting my lunch, so move it! You and the food need an interruption. I'll leave when I'll ready. They told me you had a smart mouth. Who's they, you fat shmuck? Let's just see how tough you really are. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa. Go ahead! Drop it, Louis! Go ahead! Go ahead, you tub, you tub of lard! Hell, he's crazy! Yeah? Play ball! Come on! Go ahead! He's crazy! Who is the burgess corporation? How the hell should I know? I just work here. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. [Board clatters] Come on, Louis. Crazy son of a bitch. [Cackles] Get in the car. [Sigh] Louis, we're losing ground. How do we find Archie? I laid my first broad in that house. Cocktail waitress. Virgin. Loved her. But her mother had bad breath. Look the guard was tipped off that you would come by. Now you sure you don't know anything about the burgess corporation? Never heard of it. Look. I gotta make some stops. Are we getting serious or are we going sightseeing again? Riding in the car with you is not sightseeing. I need a shave. You stay in the car. I don't wanna be seen... I don't wanna be seen... That is, Louis Keaton doesn't wanna be seen with a cop. Remember, stay in the car. Here, read the newspaper. Learn something. Oh, Luigi! Bonjourno! How are you, Mike? Bene! How you been? Here, take my coat. I'm being watched. Sure. Call me a cab will you? Hey, pronto. He's coming. Bunny: You're looking at want ads? Cause if you are, you can stop looking. My name is bunny. And I can fill all your needs. Mike: Beat it! I'm a cop. Oh, well, excuse me. I thought you looked like a man. [Cars passing] [Car starts, peels out] Aw, fuck. Keaton, what the hell are you doing? [Engine revs] [Door opens, closes] Mike: Get in the god damn car. Why the cab? You cops never listen. That cabbie could have fingered you. You ever hear of the pj club? Yeah, topless joint, north side of the island. Do they know you there? Never been in the place. Good. You ever hear of fat Tony monetti? Yeah, a street king. Prostitution. Drugs. Pornos. They say he works for big ma. Sounds familiar? Big mama controls the rackets. Nobody in the department knows who she is. Personally, I think big ma's a cover name. There's hope for you yet. They named Archie's mother big ma. Twin forty fours. Her tits had tits. [Laughs] Well if Archie's big ma, then she's behind the killings. That still doesn't explain why she's after you. Keaton: Have a Cuban cigar. Mike: I don't smoke. Besides they're illegal. [Laughs] [Club music] Inside, I do the talking. What do I do? Want information? Be my muscle. Take off the badge, got it? All right, boss. Sounds good. Keep it up. [Dance music inside] [Indistinct conversation] Take it off! Classy place. But fat Tony has a palate. Hi, there's a two drink minimum. If you wanna sit by the stage, it's five dollars it's five dollars for fondling and ten dollars for a kiss. What does it cost to puke? Hmph. Tell fat Tony Louis Keaton Mike: I'm beginning to think you're trying to get US killed. [Chuckles] Keaton: Watch how I handle this bum. May I help you? You must be Bruno. Oh, you've heard of me? No, but you're dumb enough to be a Bruno. Hold it. Mister Keaton would like to see fat Tony. Wait here. I'll tell Tony you want to see him. Man in crowd: Ee hee hee, hurt me, mama. [Laughter] Not bad, not bad. Next time, they'll offer you a job. Bring back memories? [Indistinct conversation] May be gray around the balls may be gray around the balls but there's still a home run or two in the back. I've noticed the ladies at the home hated to see you go. I had the only wand that The boss wants to see you. The boss? Fat Tony, the boss? I've been away a long time. Bongo? No, Percy. Percy. Rember, Tony, the doctor told you to eat slow and take small bites. Tony: Go on, get out of here, both of you! Louis! It's good to see you. It's been a long time. When'd you get out? Few months. You didn't need a chaperone to visit your old friend Tony. Habit from the old days. Tell your friend to hand his piece to Percy until you leave. I'd feel naked without it. You'll feel dead if Percy pulls that trigger. [Cocks gun] Michael, better give me the Roscoe. [Gunshot] [Groaning] Freeze! Unless you want a headache. Now Tony, you tell your boys to go out front and jerk off. I just came here to talk. Both of you, get out of here! Move it, now! You know it's hard to find good help. Say, kid, you want a job? Good money, lots of pussy. Tony. Who's got the number out on me? Back up! I don't know what you're talking about! Yesterday, two guys, independents. Today... a payroll stooge. They missed. No fooling. Who's big mama? Big mama? I don't know big mama. Louis, I, I'm small time. Fuck movies, snatch, titty bars! Shut up! Listen -- now you tell me. You tell me what you hear on the street. Nothing. Uh, on the head of my mother. You ain't got a mother. You pass the word I'm back, and that intend to take back what's mine. Everything! Sure, Louis! I, I'm your man, like the old times. Uh, uh, you want a new movie? Next week. Oh and Tony? Next week. Oh and Tony? Would you be so kind as to sit down for ten minutes? I don't want you to have a heart attack as we leave. [Laughs] Sure, Louis. [Indistinct crowd chatter] Play dead! [Gasps] [Laughs] [Gun cocks] [Groans] [Laughing] I'll take my gun now. Just watch where you're driving. I'm hungry. You like French fries and oysters? Not really. Fat Tony was lying. Archie's around and Tony's a stooge. Things are gonna get hot. In the meantime, I want some oysters. Then we go see lennie fontaine. All right. He was just here. Came with muscle. Said he was gonna take everything that was his back. [Club music in background] A cop? Why that dirty son of a... [Laughter] So on the weekends, you know... [Dialing] And Hayes, check out the burgess corporation for me. Right. Outside of broads, oysters are the only thing I missed in the joint. Mmm, wonderful. It helps my libido. You forget somebody's tried to kill you? You're wide open out here, a sitting duck. Ducks don't eat oysters. Tommy cantor once told me you can hit anybody anytime if you planned it. Nobody knows we're eating oysters. And even if they did, they ain't got time enough to have planned it so, so eat. Then we visit lennie fontaine. That old guy's staring at US... Nice neighborhood. Lennie was always a cheapskate. [Jazz music] He's home, I hear music. [Knocking] Lennie! [Knocking] We know you're in there! We heard the music! It's Louis. Louis Keaton! Lennie: Who is it, please? Lennie was always polite. It's me, Louis. Louis Keaton. Remember me? Remember me? Your mother used to make me crumb cakes. My mother is dead. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for you, lennie. I came to see you. Louis Keaton. Ah. Oh, would you like to come in and have some almond cakes and tea? Like I said, we always liked how have you been, lennie? Oh, older. You heard mother died, didn't you? It's been five years. I'm sorry to hear that. Oh say, uh, who's your attractive young friend? His name's gable, Mike gable. Gable, gable! Very famous, you wouldn't happen to be related-- no. All right then. Well that's a shame. Oh listen, make yourselves comfortable. I'll be back in a moment. [Suspenseful music] Here I am. [Clinking] Oh Louis was the nicest man! Every year, he-- get down! [Explosion] Go! What in the --? What in the son of a bitch? How's lennie? He's history. Put your foot down! [Car zooms away] [Gunshots] Sorry, lennie. Get in the car! Thank your mother for the crumb cakes. Damn it, Keaton, hurry up! They're getting away! Wait a minute! Hey! Wait! Aw, wait! Would you get in the goddamn car? Ah, I'm too old for this shit! [Amusing country music] What are we chasing? Telephone truck! It went that way! I see it! I don't like this, I don't like... Whoaaaa! Whoaaaa! He went that way! I see him! Evidently, that's not a real telephone truck. No shit! Is this considered a high speed chase? You got it! Let me off at the next corner! What are you doing? Did you know my father was once a hobo? Did you have a mother? She was a fine dancer! Would you slow down? Would you shut up and just hold on? Keaton: Hail Mary full of grace, as with the old father... Oh, oh, in heaven! Mike: Don't stop now! Keep praying! [Music builds] [Gunshots] Whoa, they're shooting at US! Ahh! You better hope they're out of grenades. Wahhh! Don't this city have any traffic cops? Yeah, they're probably out having coffee and donuts. [Gunshot] Dammit, they're gaing on US. Can't this son of a bitch go any faster? I got it to the floor! That son of a bitch is good. Take the wheel! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] You missed! Be careful, he's trying to kill US! [Crashing] Mike: Hang on! [Screams] No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! No! [Tires squeal] Oh, you're gonna hit it! [Gun fires] [Country music continues] [Cars honking] [Gunshots] [Traffic sounds] [Crashing] [Screeching] [Crashing, honking] I'm losing power! [Gunshot] Grab the wheel! Ah! Pull over first! Grab the damn wheel! Stop! Hey! What are you doing? [Gunshots] Damn it! [Gunshots] I thought you could drive. I never drove a car in my life. Give me the gun! You drive! Just don't shoot yourself. I taught varmints how to shoot! [Gunshots] [Lights shatter] Ah! You almost hit a pedestrian! Give me my gun! You hit a bum! [Gunshot] Load the grenade! Any more bullets? [Clinking] Yes, here! [Car honks] They're shooting at US! Damn it, go faster! Hurry up, get it loaded! All right! [Gunshot] [Car honking] Try and hit something! Wait, I'll get closer. [Cars honking] [Crashing] [Gunshots] You did them! Keep this god damn thing straight! I'll hit 'em with a grenade! You son of a bitch! Be careful, don't blow US up! [Screeching] [Gunshots] Shit! [Explosion] [Ominous music] I think I hit the gas tank. Sure, Louis, just like Tom micks. [Waves crashing] [Fire crackling] You know I got a twenty four watch on fat Tony's place. I've got his phone bugged and if he chews too loud, I can pick him up for disturbing the peace. Did Hayes check out the burgess corporation? Burgess corporation has one of the oldest families on the island. Bluebloods. Real society. So what? I'm still gonna nail 'em. Hey, listen, ray Channing owns the mayor and half the city council. You wanna fool around with him, it's your neck. It's your neck. Not mine. Ten to one, fat Tony and his goons are out there right now on the street. You know you have a very strong attraction for violence? And you've been lucky so far. And you know what, you're not gonna die in bed. You're gonna die in a foot race. You're gonna come in second to a bullet running down an alleyway. Now get him outta here. All right, get in the car. Come on, get this wreck out of here, move it! Come on, you're holding up my retirement. Hey! Hey that's my car! [Cartoon noises] Hi. Hi. Hi, who are you? [Laughs] Who are you? Jimmy. My dad lives here. He leaves the key under the mat for me. Oh. My name is Susan. I'm a friend of your dad's. How'd you get here? My mom dropped me off. Her and uncle Charlie went away for the weekend. You hungry? Well, blue and I like peanut butter sandwiches. [Dog groaning] Well two peanut butter sandwiches with milk coming up. We don't like milk. Oh. Dad and I are going to the circus. Do you wanna come? Uh, sure if it's okay with your dad. Should I call you aunt Susan? Heh, why? Well my mom says that all of her boyfriends are my uncles. So I just thought-- no, why don't you just call me Susan, okay? Heh, great. My dad doesn't like my uncles very much. Listen, why don't you and blue and I go down to the beach after we eat okay? Yeah! [Cabinet door closing] Okay, here's number one sandwich. And number two's on its way. Mmm, thank you! Come on, blue! [Barking] Get the, the ball. Here, boy. Make yourself at home. Would you like a beer? Why not? Like music? [Plays "you lied your way"] I love music. My uncle was a musician. Played the organ with a monkey. I don't like that music. Well I like it. You would. I feel like I've been hit on the head with a guitar. I love love song. You know today, today, this is a cockamie generation. Oh these kids, they dance so far apart, you'd think each one has leprosy. They hop and, and, and, and they, and they, and they fall to the, to the floor. It's breakdancing. It's a fad, like the jitterbug. Are you kidding? Jitterbug? Jitterbug?! That's dancing. [Miming music noises] Everything has changed. I read the other day in the newspaper that this bum robs this mom and pop grocery mart. Takes their money and then blows them away. With Tommy around this island, he would have taken that creep and thrown him into the ocean and the sharks would encircle him. And then they'd have him for dessert. The trouble with today is there's no pride. No loyalty. No tradition. [Footsteps] That's Susan, my nurse? Yeah. Your kid? Name's Jimmy. Dog's name's blue. I changed my mind. No oysters for dinner. Steaks. You like steaks? Yeah. Tell you what, you stay close, I'm gonna go join em. I'll go lay on the sofa and take a nap. Then we'll have dinner. [Barking] You know, Tommy, you'd like this kid. Good cop. [Barking] [Plays "you lied your way"] Just what am I just what am I supposed to do? Yeah, yeah I'll get it. Dad, Susan taught blue how to catch. Thanks, fool thanks, fool oh, the love I had for you was based on false pretenses all them things you told me woo! Louis? Louis? Hey, check the bedroom! [Rock music on television] He's not here! Yeah, dispatch. Detective gable. Homicide two-three-two-six. I want an apb immediately for a Louis Keaton. Deputy Hayes will confirm and give identification. Right. What the hell is this? Channing residence. Bingo. You two sit tight. If I'm not back in two hours, if I'm not back in two hours, call Spencer and tell him to send out a search party! Where's dad going? Mike. Is Keaton all right? To you and me, yes. To Louis, it's another day in the office. [Kissing sound] Be careful. Bye dad! He'll be okay, won't he? [Ringing] Hayes. [Suspenseful music] Got it. Come on in, Mike. Well, Hayes. Mrs. Channing doesn't like smoking or guns in the house. Seems odd she doesn't mind shit. Into the next room. [Laughing] You should have took the job, kid. [Laughs] Welcome, mister gable. I'm Sandra Channing. I thought you were Archie gish. Now I know why they call you big ma. You'll have to forgive me but I detest those names. Uh, my husband, mister ray Channing. And I believe you know the other gentlemen in the room. We're just about to leave. We're going to meet a friend of yours. He invited US to a party. If you'll excuse me, I don't like crashing parties. I'm afraid you have no choice. [Laughing] Mister gable will be our guest. Darling, bring my purse. Let's move it. We don't want to keep uncle Louis waiting. Keaton: Keep the change. [Whistling] Oh fatty! Fatty! [Groaning] One, two, three strikes you're out in the old ballgame. [Whistling] [Suspenseful music] So what did uncle Louis tell you about me? Oh, nothing much. He told me a little story about your mother and the pimp. How crude but true. Yeah my mother was tough. I had to be like her. Why did you go from Tommy cantor to mister Channing here? He need money and I need position. When Tommy died, I called in his gambling markers. He couldn't pay, so he married me instead. He caused his old hag of a mother to drop dead. I keep him around for laughs. He's more of a stud than he looks. Why the hit on Louis and the others? Old loyalties run deep. When Louis got out of prison, he became a threat. And besides, he's the only one that knows where the vault is hidden. You really believe there is a vault? I used to think so, but we've taken that building apart board by board and so far we haven't found a thing. I'm surprised uncle Louis told you about it. He didn't. Louis never told me anything. [Laughs] That's the Louis I know. There's no way I can allow him to find that money. The fact is if Louis finds it, I could be up shit creek. Thirty million buys an awful lot of power. Ahhh. Thirty million. [Kissing sound] [Doors opening] [Doors closing] He's here. Let's get it over with. I smell something. You smell something funny? It's an old house. Old houses stink! I don't like the dark. Keep your mouth shut! Keaton: Archie, you're late! [Gunshot] You missed! [Laughter] [Gunshot] Louis, we have to talk. So talk. Fifty fifty. And your position back like in the old days with Tommy. What about the thirty years? Aw come on now, that's water under the bridge! I have gable. Now is it a deal? You have ten seconds. Keaton: No deal! Hang in there, Mike! [Lighter igniting] [Mysterious music] Oh my god! Whoa! Whoa! Fire, let's go! Oh my god! Move, move! [Gunshots] Move, move, come on! I told you I smelled something funny. Let me think. Hell of a son of a bitch. [Lighter igniting] [Punch connecting] [Groan] Move it! [Gunshot] Shit! Well my dear, now what? We'll just have to wing it, won't we? I think I hit gable. [Groaning] Mike! You okay? I can shoot. Good. The party's just starting. And what the hell are you throwing? A bbq? I hope that old bastard's lighter's out of fluid. [Reloading] Get ready, I'm gonna flush them out. [Screaming] Run you dirty bastard! [Screaming] [Gunshots] Hayes, it's gable. Come out with your hands up! Well, I think we got 'em by the balls! Police officer, rember? You got ten seconds! Listen, I have no intention of doing it. Hayes, we have one chance. Let's all come out shooting. Are you game? Better than roasting. How about you my dear? [Laughs] Whatever we channings might be, we're not cowards. Let's do it! [Screams] [Gunshots] Hold it! Let me go! I'll get her! No, let her go! Let me go! Stop her! [Sirens] [Helicopter whirs overhead] This is the police! The place is surrounded! Come out with your hands up! [Coughing] Let's get out of here! You threw a hell of a party. Keaton, gable, are you in there? [Glass shatters] It's Spencer! [Background chatter] Gable, you need help? No, I'm all right. You know, we got big ma. Get your hands off me! You fuckers! Since you caught big ma, maybe you should run for mayor. Well I'll think about it. In the meantime, there's someone looking for you. [Slow music] It's all right. Mike, we've been so worried. Dad. Are you okay, dad? How about a pizza? Sounds great. [Laughs] Hey dad, can Susan come with US to the circus? Son, this is a circus. Besides, we wouldn't go without her. All right. What are you gonna do, now that you're retired? I'm going to Switzerland and eat a whole lot of oysters. [Background chatter] [Applause] [Cheering] Yeah! I'm gonna miss that kid. You know, I'm surprised he never threw you out a window. [Cheering] [Whistling]
