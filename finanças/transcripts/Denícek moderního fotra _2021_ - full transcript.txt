Welcome to my world. A world of suffering and pain. I want to see lots of lovely pictures in the papers. -I'd like to ask… -Not now. We're taking pictures. Later. You there. Did you get a photo? I hope so. We invest more in ads than we do in toy development. Hand me the pony, please. So, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce our new multifunction project, Chuckles the Pony. Okay? Don't look at me. It wasn't my idea. I didn't come up with it. But kids love it. It works. I think we're first place in that. But we are a bit behind in punctuality. Oh, well. That's what happens when you employ artists. Allow me to introduce the project's creator, our promising toy designer, Miss Nataša Bílková. Go ahead. Present it quickly, so we're done by lunch. I based this on the fact that laughter is what calms children the most. But when a child is crying, parents are in no mood for laughter. So that's where our pony comes in. I've put all the details in our press release. -Miss? -Yes? I'm sorry, but some details are missing from your press release. -Oh. What do you need to know? -Well, there's a new rule. If we quote someone in an article, then we have to include basic information about them, such as their favorite restaurant and phone number. So you're writing a book? Well, kind of. I'm in the preparatory phase. -What does that look like? -It's taking shape in my mind. -So not just a book but a best seller. -Exactly. -About love. -That can be there too. If it's not, then I won't read it, and it won't be a best seller. The thing is, I haven't had much time for writing lately. -I've been reporting. -On my world-class toys. But I'm quitting and going to England to study creative writing. Really? For how long? One year. Around here, a reporter is always coming across distractions. Well, if all your distractions end up like this, -then you've got one hard life. -Exactly. How can a guy make literary history when all he does is prowl? I'm so sorry. I should be going then, so I don't distract you from your work. I think you're right. You'd better go. You can't have me. Sorry. It's for the benefit of mankind. I'll have a cry at home, but that's life. Now, girls. No going for shots with the first guy you see. And now I'm off to England to study creative writing. You know, a guy faces so many distractions around here. You mean like me? Hi. Hey! -Your sister? -No. -Cousin? -No. -Aunt? -No. Niece twice removed? Nope. Be smart. Use contraception. Idiot. Womanizer. Leaves his job for some half-baked novel. Now just imagine if he knocked you up. Well, well. -Hello? -Hey, you probably won't remember me… Hi. Of course I remember you. You're just minding your own business when a girl from whom you expected nothing more than one nice night pees on a plastic stick, and that's that. You're going to be a dad. Great feeling, isn't it? So uplifting. -Hi. -So… Come in. Do we agree that I'm keeping the child? That puts us in an awkward situation. You did this to me, and you're not planning to have a future with me. If you don't want a baby, then I'll manage on my own, but I've got nowhere to live. But I thought you lived with your parents. And don't you want to call Igor? Maybe he'd take you back even with a baby. I can arrange it with the hospital. Just one call, and the problem's over. There's nothing to be ashamed of. No. I mean, yes, but it's only temporary. I broke up with my boyfriend and had nowhere else to go. But I have no intention of raising a child in my parents' house. I know how you feel. I'm going to be a granny. A little goalie on the way. That's a nice power play. What do you mean you don't really know each other? And when is the wedding? There will be a wedding, right? I guess after they get to know each other. I'll stick it out with my parents until I find a place. You've got seven months. Then you start paying child support. Hang on, hang on. I've quit my job and applied to study in England, so my budget isn't really set up to pay child support. All I can responsibly provide is this accommodation. -And when are you leaving? -Like now. Now? Yeah, now. -And can it be postponed? -Hypothetically. What's in my belly isn't hypothetical. I could apply for next year, hypothetically. You're an irresponsible, promiscuous guy with no money for child support, and you are the father of my child. -That's how it is. -Then you'll postpone it and find a job! Right. -And how is it with your job? -My boss put my feet to the fire. If I'm not back in a month after the birth, then I lose my job. Listen. I believe in equality between men and women. And I think the parent who brings home less money should be the one who stays home with the baby. You've got a great job. You like it. I want to write a novel, and if I'm home with a baby, then I'll have the time. Are you serious? One year. Imagine, in one year, the product of our mutual… Sex. Sex. In a year, we can put him in a nursery, you'll still have your job, and I can go to England. I think, in our situation, that's the best possible solution. Okay, but no playing house. -It will be purely rational… -Cohabitation. …space sharing in order to ensure the basic needs of a minor. So, one year? -Then you leave him with me and go. -To England. -And you'll pay. -You bet. Fine. Well, at least you'll get rid of the good-for-nothing. Have you really thought this over? Caring for a child is not as easy as they say. Hold this. Give me that. You can't even care for an animal. How do you want to take care of a child? I'll feed it, rock it, clean its butt, and the main thing is, I'll finally have time to write. Maybe it was meant to be. I'll write my novel. It's a master plan. Now for some celery? But of course. A year will pass quickly. Then I'll hand the kid over and go. -To England. -To England. Great. There's a lot of fun in store for me. We're giving birth! Hello. Hello. We're in labor. How frequent are your contractions? Every three or four minutes. I know you normally give earrings for a baby, but… Here's Mr. Panda. Meanwhile, I'll just wait here and regret my actions. Where have you been for so long? I was at another birth. For training. I'm going to kill you. How's it looking? I've signed all the forms, so hopefully they'll let me give birth now. Is there anything I can do for you? Don't worry. It won't be long now. Don't worry. It won't be long now. You're brave. So, Daddy, come and cut the umbilical cord. Should I? Mother, what name shall I write? Čeněk. Well, buddy, you've got a lot to look forward to. Welcome to hell. 365 DAYS LEFT 1ST NIGHT Čeněk had a little lamb Čeněk had a little lamb Whose fleece was white as snow You have my admiration. I refuse to bounce on a ball like that. I won't sing either. The postnatal period is a dreamy time for every mother. A time when she can bond with her child, and full of femininity and promise for the future, she is surrounded by love, turtledoves, puppies, and unicorns. But for the father, the postnatal period is a time of woe, desperation, panic, dark thoughts, stomach and other ulcers, as well as sleep disorders. And this was all just a teaser for what was to come. God help us. Or rather, me. Cloth diapers, clothes, onesies, and sweatpants. Take them from the upper left side, understand? WEEK 7 - 320 MORE DAYS Breast milk. Defrost it, heat it to 37 degrees Celsius. Feed him at 9:00, 12:00, 3:00, et cetera. Every three hours until I'm back. If he gets hungry before then, give him 60 milliliters. How can I tell if he's hungry? He'll start crying. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Kids do that. So I can just put a tube in his mouth and let milk pour in all day. All done. Father of the year. No, I'll have him back in mint condition, with minimal wear and tear. If not, I'll make you spend the weekend with my parents. -You wouldn't dare. -Do you want to risk it? So there you go. Vitamin D. At 9:00 a.m., you put two drops in his milk. You know where to find the diapers and butt cream. Yeah. Now repeat everything for me. Including the threat about your parents. -I think you're ready to have children. -You think? Six children. With someone else. If I understand correctly, your son is telling me he's hungry. That's not hungry crying. I have to go. If you need anything, call me. Enjoy maternity leave. And what kind of cry is it? How am I supposed to tell hungry crying from… crying. Look here, hotshot. Mama's not here to spoil you anymore. It's time for boot camp. -Look, Nataša! -Finally! -Hi! -Hi! -Hi. -Hi. What's this? -Oh, I guess he threw up on me. -Dominik or Čeněk? -Do you have a new hairstylist? -Do you want a black eye? -Hi, Nataša. -Hi, Igor. You look… -It suits you. -Thanks. So what about the baby? What's it like to be a mom? Fantastic. Great. What can I say? Okay then. -He must be pissed it's not his baby. -Don't be stupid. You don't regret breaking up, not even a little? You okay? Yeah. It's just my first time in six weeks without the baby and with other people. -Well, six weeks isn't that much, right? -She doesn't have kids. When you're up ten times a night, it feels like days have passed. I feel like I haven't been here in a year. Dominik will manage. Don't worry. Yeah. He'll manage. Come on, now. Hello, my love. Hello. My little love. Before you judge me, you should realize that I'm only a man and have no genetic predisposition for this. For cleaning up, you mean? Cleaning up is no problem, but this stinking, screaming thingamabob… You were probably born knowing what to do with it. -Whereas this mere mortal… -Have you eaten? Yeah. I ate some crumbs off the ground and licked my hand when your son sneezed on me. There's so little left of me that it should be enough. What a hero. You're my hero. Next time, maybe you'll manage the dishes and the laundry too. 2ND DAY WITH BABY 319 MORE DAYS Hey, Mom. Listen, do you know how to turn on a washing machine? What do you mean you don't understand modern washing machines? Isn't a washing machine a washing machine? Hi. Do I need a reason to call my mother-in-law? Oh, your maid does the laundry. I see. Yeah, of course. THE WATCHTOWER Hello. I bring you good news. -Come in. -May I? Okay. Do you know how to turn it on? Mom? As the weeks pass, I start getting used to it. I no longer expect anything of life. DAYS LEFT - 319 I have become a child-rearing machine. Anything that disturbs the daily routine strikes me as evil, inhuman, useless and horrible. DAYS LEFT DAYS LEFT Radio Impuls. We're celebrating International Day of Czech-- …604-… He's survived so far. That's the main thing. -Which one? -Both. The good thing about the little one is, he can't run away, and the big one hasn't run yet, and that says a lot. Well, he'll run away in a year. What's the difference? By then, someone else might turn up, right? Come on. Who wants a single mother? I'm sorry. No problem. But you still have a few options left. You're crazy. -Hi. -Hi. I need… I need to talk to you about a work issue. Oh. Go ahead. Over coffee would be better. Maybe after lunch today? Sure. Okay. Okay then. "Work issue," huh? He might be my ex, but he's also my colleague and superior. No ulterior motives. Yeah, so we see. He was a bore. I know. The important thing is you're not bored anymore. So, how are you doing? I thought this was a work meeting. It is, but… I just want to know if you're happy. I am. I'm very happy. Here you are. I was worried about you. -My mother called you. -Your mother called me. I'll kill her. -But if you want to talk-- -I don't want to talk. I'm fine. And then I agreed to this absurd deal that he'd leave in a year. -That's awful. -Yep. -What will you do afterward? -I don't know. Čeněk can go to a nursery, so I was thinking maybe I could work part-time from home? Yeah. No problem. I'll set it up with the boss. Thanks. That's really nice of you. I don't know how you can have a crush on a chick with a kid. Nobody's perfect. And that mom is seriously gorgeous. But she's got a kid. You have no idea what it entails. You don't eat, you don't sleep, you don't live. And you still want to run? No change? Like that I'd suddenly decide to stay and be a model dad? You're right. That would be truly evil of you. I was expecting a sense of fatherhood to awaken in me automatically. But I think guys just aren't programmed with a love for children. Oh, so chauvinism. Bullshit, man. It's biology. Don't say bullshit in front of him, or he'll learn it. He's not going to learn shit. He's just a little animal without a brain or emotions. Listen, I'm not judging you, but I think there are things you just shouldn't say out loud. -Won't he be traumatized? -Dominik? No, the little one. It doesn't seem right to leave him with someone who doesn't love him. I'm not saying I don't love him. Well… How shall I put it? You are. Look, I didn't leg it. Why does everyone admire him for not legging it? -What kind of heroism is that? -I don't admire him. In my opinion, this is actually much worse. The only reason he did it was to write his stupid novel, certainly not because of us. Sorry. Hey, your mom's in there with some guy. Well? Well? He wanted to talk about the presentation for the bear. -Right. And what did you find out? -That it's going to happen. Okay. Okay. He wanted to talk. -So he wants you back. -Don't be silly. Hello, Nataša. So Igor informed you? More or less, okay… More or less, aha… You're getting a bonus. 2,000 crowns. For a hairstylist. Maybe some new clothes. And so on and so on. We have to represent the company. And you, tidy up your desk. You have more photos of children than anything resembling work. Damn it. Petra! Coffee and a croissant, right now. What an asshole. Buddy. Don't take it personally, but I'm not up for this. And if I don't want to leg it, then there's only one thing I can do. We're going to find your mother a boyfriend. A boyfriend who wants to be a dad. You've got ten baby packs… 3 MONTHS …five cotton rompers… 275 MORE DAYS …four overalls, three coats, sweatshirts and sweaters, two of those cotton hats. Four socks, cotton mittens and booties. What are rompers? And put these marmalades in the pantry after, okay? Right. It's easy. If there's nothing from one breast, then you put him on the other. Ping-pong. Should I hold him to the breast with tape, or what? Look, it's supply and demand. If the body senses no need for milk, then it will stop producing, you see? I guess I'm just a useless mother. It's all my fault. I can't even nurse my own child. I didn't nurse Dominik at all. It just didn't work. -He went straight to formula. -And look how manly I am. Mothers have it tough nowadays. You see it everywhere. "Nurse! Nurse!" And if you just can't? It's different for everyone. The doctors just need to have everything by the book. No one expected an offspring of mine to be by the book, did they? Coach. So what about potential dads? Mom. What? We all know you're not staying together. We respect it. I'm just asking. I'd also like to know who my daughter and grandson will be living with when the time runs out on your pact. What about Igor? Have you spoken? Igor? How about Igor? Well, I also want to know who's going to care for them. You should be the one caring for them. -Dominik does take care. -For now. Dad, please. Can't we just enjoy this lunch in peace? My dear, life is not about enjoyment. You two should know that by now. -I'm having a great time. -Maybe if you talked to your mother more. Hold on, hold on. I'm the villain here, not Nataša. So please focus your anger on me. Otherwise, the little guy won't get a drop out of her. How are you sleeping at night? I did some research. On average, babies sleep 20 hours a day. -However, we have an extraordinary baby. -Mankind's next stage of development. He's basically an evolutionary miracle that requires virtually no sleep at all. Homo insomniens. The problem is, his mother and I are the obsolete type of humans, so we are badly losing the evolutionary race. Homo sleepiens. Just don't lose your heads. The baby's important, but you have to think of yourself too. What if you went to the hairdresser's? Look, I don't even know when I last washed my hair. Exactly. Look at our sweet little angel. You like being with grandma, do you? Eat with your mouth closed. You will let us take him even afterward, won't you? Of course. If that's what you want. We do. Have no doubt, my girl. Who wouldn't want such a gorgeous little guy, right? Get Grandpa! Get Grandpa! See you later. And have fun. Just don't lose your heads. And don't forget. -Come on. -Bye. You were hoping they'd take him with them, huh? Jesus, I really look awful. Nonsense. You're beautiful. I wouldn't sleep with an ugly girl. The boss gave me a bonus for clothes and a hairstylist. We've got one muddy monkey here. That's what Čeněk thinks of your boss. Are you sure it's not because of the beau from the café? Mud maker and I know all about it. We saw everything. So the question is, who was it? Who was it? A tragedy. We're out of cream. There is a danger of butt rash. When your son has a butt rash, it's no tragedy. It's an apocalypse. Luckily, we have some baby powder. And so who was he? -Remember we talked about my ex? -Yeah. Yeah. So it was that Igor guy. Pillow or blow-dryer? Pillow, please. The blow-dryer is doing my head in. Look on the bright side. You'll have muscular legs, and that's sexy. What are you doing? What did I tell you? -Guys are interested in other things. -Really? Like proper comportment, intellect, heart. No, eyes. Yes? Is this the one? Is it? This one? Okay then. All right. See, a man knows. -You look great. -Really? Isn't it too much? I think any normal guy would be on the verge of a heart attack. -Well, thanks, buddy. -Welcome, buddy. Čeněk picked the clothes. Great, Nataša, but get moving. We're about to start. 4 MONTHS - 245 DAYS LEFT If you were waiting for your chance, buddy, it just passed by. That's no good. She's got a kid. She must be married. -Then let's find out. -How? We've got our ticket right here. Hang on, hang on. You can't do that. Why? Čeněk and I are just networking. Get out of the way. Hang on, hang on. You really can't do that. -It's embarrassing. -Calm down. Take him. Wait a second. I think we've got a problem. -A muddy monkey? -Yeah. I don't have a spare diaper. There's a sad fact that I think you need to accept. You're never going to be a mother. I'll just have to take a new approach. Grandpa would be proud of us, buddy. And so we secretly hoped that it just wouldn't happen, and King Čeněk wouldn't grow any teeth at all. Or maybe when he's all grown up, and then it wouldn't be our problem. Unfortunately, our secret wishes did not come true, and one fine, sunny day, it happened. -How was the presentation? -Wonderful. It was a success, but I'm running out of ideas. The young ruler of the apartment was out of sorts that day. It was obvious that something was about to happen. His morning poop was so pathetic, it didn't even make it through his diaper and on to the bed, and he didn't even put his usual energy into vomiting all over the floor. Why don't you publish this? Something wasn't right. Coach. No more slacking off. -A Dictaphone? -Yep. In the bear's belly. So every parent can record their favorite lullaby, and their voice will come from the toy. A parent's voice is what most calms a baby. DIARY OF A MODERN DAD Welcome to my world. A world of pain and suffering. Welcome to hell. As a proper father, leader of the pack, master of the house and general handy dad, I decided to familiarize my son with the beauty of manual labor. Čeněk got a hearty laugh out of my pain and clapped his hands. Once construction was complete, it was time for a stress test. "Although Čeněk and I are of the same nationality, I have encountered a language barrier." "My solid arguments as to why fingers do not belong in sockets were met by Čeněk with the words 'Goo, goo, blah, blah,' whereby he threw up on himself and began licking the socket." Čeněk is reaching an age where he can no longer be left alone… 6 MONTHS - 180 DAYS LEFT …to roam the apartment at will and bang his head against the furniture. Did you expect your blog to be such a hit when you wrote the first lines? Not at all. It was more of a desperate attempt to do some writing while parenting. Amazing. A lot of mothers out there are envious of your partner. You're something of a superdad. Do you see yourself that way? Like superdad? Well… I can't throw the kid out on the street, right? And can you tell us about your plans for the future? -Humming? -Not only. Humming bears already exist. Even Duchess Kate has one. But every baby has sounds they prefer, like Čeněk loves the blow-dryer. And then you have sounds associated with different activities, like the sound of water evokes peeing. So a universal toy that has all this programmed in. That's brilliant. Never underestimate a working mother. I'm sorry, they're… I'm going to forbid that. Life with a child is basically all about three elements. Food, poop, and sleep. First comes food. Then the poop. And lastly, the most important thing. Sleep. -So, kids, who wants to ride the pony? -Me! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not a pony! I'm Vašek! Hang on. Hang on a sec. -Hey. -Hey. So what's up with that beauty of yours? Tatiana. Her name is Tatiana. -Tatiana! -Not so loud. -Does Tatiana have an Onegin? -How should I know? I'm supposed to ask her if she has a man back home? Wait! You can't do that! She doesn't! So here's to our success, friends. To success, and most importantly, to Nataša. To Nataša. It's a phenomenal success. There is enormous interest in our toy. Nevertheless, we have a lot of work to do in the coming weeks and months, and a lot of overtime, but that goes with success, right? -But I have a child at home. -Come on. Now you'll be able to afford the best nanny 24 hours a day. But I don't want him to be with a nanny. I… I want him to be with me. Tooth? Tooth. Let me see. Come here. Come here. There, now. It's okay. Let's see. Let's see here. "Off goes Vixen with her loot, one sackful of gingerroot." "But Hedgehog's running right behind to poke it with his prickly spines." Not to get nitpicky, but some of these nursery rhymes don't set the best example, okay? Poor vixen travels who knows how far with a sack full of ginger, and that sneaky hedgehog wants to poke holes in it. No, no. Bad. Big no-no. What about this one? "Little Gran had four cans of jam, and Grandpa only two." "Listen, Gran. Give me one can." "That's three for me and three for you." That's bold-faced communist propaganda, buddy. Granny is forced to divvy up with an unsuccessful old man who couldn't make it in the jam market. Listen. This one's great. "If all the world were paper, and all the sea were ink, and if all the trees were bread and cheese, what would we have to drink?" That's enough. My diary of Čeněk's life can't compete with that. Listen. Well, well! Big daddy says he's never going to sing, and now, such a concert. -And you can go in here. -Says who? -You'll pay for that. -What are you going to do? You think you can punish me with something worse than your son? You're asking for trouble. In the form of a second Čeněk. "A-tisket, a-tasket, a green and yellow basket." So, you're thinking about going back to Igor? Not if you keep asking, no. Aha. What does he think? He approves. That's the very least he can do. Dad, he's got a lot on him. He takes care of Čeněk. Oh, he's got a lot on him. Well, that's his doing, isn't it? I've got tennis in half an hour. Let's go, okay? Ladies and gentlemen, take care. -Bye. -Bye. -You look lovely, Nataša. -Thank you. Right? You little sweetheart. Right now he's a sweetheart. Try having him overnight. You. No problem. Grandma and Grandpa would be happy to have him, right? Well, he has been much better lately. Yeah. His teeth are almost out. He hardly wakes up at night anymore. -Yeah. He's a sweetheart. -Completely. What do you say, Grandpa? One night. No, we can't ask that of you. Yeah, but if you want, then… What do you say, little goalie? -You know what's weird, though? -What? We're giving our child away, and I don't feel sad or even miss him. Am I weird? I'm thrilled! I just didn't want him to see it, so as not to cause him trauma. It doesn't matter. They won't make it through the night. If they call or, God forbid, try to bring him back, -then we'll play dead. -We'll say I died, and you're in jail. -And we'll turn our phones off. -Yeah! Oh, what a little cutie. He's so adorable. The way he cuddles up to you. Do you think he's sad? No. He's a tough guy like his dad. Did you tell them to give him a kiss after his evening milk? Out. Grandpa and I will manage. A baby needs nice, well-rested parents, not a couple of worn-out wrecks. See you. First night without the baby. What are we going to do? Clean up. Clean up. Don't put the cups upside down, or they get musty and stink. I could say that this is my place and my rules. You could, of course. But that would get us into a long exchange of opinions. Naturally, I would offer strong arguments as to why it's better to put the cups down like this. And I would argue that it gets musty and stinks. And I would relent, because a man can either live in truth or in peace. You are clearly experienced and world-wise. -We shouldn't do that. -We won't sleep together. Definitely not. -It's just medicine. -For loneliness. Between two devastated… -Parents. -Parents. What now? We can finish cleaning up. How did it go? He's a sweetheart. Tell me about it. It's really good. Thanks, buddy. Welcome, buddy. About your Dictaphone invention… I have a confession to make. -You listen to it before bed. -Nope. But I stole your idea. Parents can record a lullaby, the Dictaphone goes in the bear's belly, and it soothes the baby in bed. -That's a great idea. -The boss thinks so too. Then why haven't we been celebrating? Buddy, your mom is awesome. It will mean some business trips and a bit more work, of course. How much more? Quite a lot. I'll be getting home around 8:00 p.m. in the beginning, and next week we're going to a toy fair to present it. For how long? Just for one night, but it won't be the only time. And this arrangement will be for how long? I don't know. Aha. Do you think I wanted it this way? Hi! -Well, well. -Hello, my darling. My love. Hey there, buddy. So you're Čeněk. -Pleased to meet you. -He's shy. Pleased to meet you too. Dominik. Igor. -Work coffee? -Yeah. You want your mama back home, huh? Well, he is just so cute. Oopsy. I can lend him to you for a night. I'll come for my things at 5:00 p.m., and we'll be off. I know. I know it. -And shall I pick you up at home? -Yes. Well, we must be off. Mashed broccoli with trout awaits. Yummy! Say bye-bye to mama and Mr. Igor. Let's go. -Really beautiful. -Isn't he? So, buddy, our plan worked out. Mama's all crazy about Igor. That overly handsome, tall… Great. I was thinking the bears could be sold with a sewing kit. So every mother could stitch their baby's name on it. That's a great idea. Where do you come up with them? Never underestimate a working mother. No, seriously. You're amazing. Thanks, buddy. Is something wrong? I just miss Čeněk so much. The worst thing of all is that he loves Dominik so much, and he doesn't know he's going to lose him soon. Honey. Mommy will be home soon. Don't worry. But Auntie's nice to you, isn't she? So you see? Okay. Go to sleep one more time, and Mommy will be home. Okay? There you go. I miss you too. Sleep well. Bye-bye. The kid's sad. -He's with a nanny? -Yeah. We have a great nanny, but… It's usually fine, but sometimes it just pisses me off he's got no dad. And I miss the little devil so much. -Damn it all to hell! Me too! -Damn it all to hell! What's the little diddums doing, I wonder. Hi. I'm not up to this. The kid needs his mom. Okay. And what do you propose? -Čeněk Bridge is falling down -Falling down, falling down Drink some milk and pass it round Pass it round, pass it round Čeněk Bridge is falling down, falling down -Drink some milk and pass it round -Drink some milk and pass it round Build it up with stone so strong Stone so strong, stone so strong It will last for ages long Ages long, ages long Čeněk Bridge is falling down Falling down, falling down Čeněk Bridge is falling down, my fair lady He's out. I guess he was just dreaming about murderous ponies. How are you? I'm sad. We are too. Oh, you're not asleep? I… I… Sorry. No. You're a little sweetie. DIARY OF A MODERN DAD CENEK IS MOBILE. SAVE OUR SOULS! "He's a hero. I wouldn't cope." "When the woman's a careerist, the man's got to step up." "His wife doesn't know what she's got in him." "Work's more important to his wife." "He's a champ. I wish I had him at home." "Ha ha! The guy's a hero!" 11 MONTHS - ONLY 31 DAYS LEFT As the months pass, I get used to it. The schedule is rock-solid. Time is relative. The things that used to seem to take months with Čeněk, now they take minutes. Suddenly, boom. A year has passed. Buddy. Your dad has made a terrible mistake. You're 11 months old, so we've got one month. Your dad's going to sweep your mom off her feet. And you have to help him. First, we'll try it the old-fashioned way. A good dinner, with a bouquet and candles. What is this? Lamb with a béchamel sauce. Čeněk helped. What an idiot. We have to find the enemy's weakness and strike there. I have a stove with a smoke detector exactly for cases like this. Like, sorry, but safety is foremost, especially when you have a small child. That's not exactly Dominik's motto. He's more-- Must we always talk about Dominik? -Sorry. -No, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm really sick of it. You don't have to be. Ha! You want coffee, you king of the tall monkeys? Look how he struts his stuff in front of her. I've been thinking about us, and I'm certain about it. I've really missed you. He's using his lines on her! What's he telling her? "Look how handsome and symmetrical I am." "My teeth are beautiful. Just look at them." "I'll be a lifelong role model for your son." Not a chance, butthead! And Čeněk is just great, really. What a doll. He would definitely get used to me. You knew I was ready for a kid. Just in case the work gets to be too much, I've found the best nannies. Is that a prenuptial agreement? Čeněk? -Darling! Give him to me. -It's not the kid's fault. Give him to me. Are you okay? -He has a dirty diaper. -I guess that's why he slid out so easily. Damn it! Here. So you've been spying on me. We were passing by, and he wanted to go for a crawl. It was your idea that I find a man so you could ditch us. Excuse me? But I have to say, we work well together. -This is just great. -Do you have a problem? No, none at all. He's cute. Such a doll. -Where are you going? -Where are you going? -I've had enough. -Okay, I'm a dummy, but you can't-- I lost 11 months of my baby's life. I'm quitting my job. -What? Are you crazy? -Just the opposite. -I should have told you both off ages ago. -This is an amazing work opportunity! Sitting in an office all day waiting for his childhood to end? The job's not that great. But life isn't all about enjoyment, Nataša. Igor, you're a nice guy… But you're going to be just friends. You take him home. Without any accidents. And I'll pick him up later. Go get that big box from my cabinet. Inside is my contract with Hrackouni. For God's sake, Nataša. You can't be serious about this. Two other jerks told me that today too, and they're lucky they're still alive. Seriously. You can't just leave. Don't you know how much you mean to us? You be quiet. Or I'll sue you for workplace harassment. But, Nataša, Igor's right. Without you, we're completely screwed. Well, if you're screwed without me, then give me the conditions I need. I'm sick of this. Have you got that contract? Oh, yeah! It's not in here. Buddy. Give me that contract. Give me that contract. Come here! Come here! Come here! Give it to me, or your mom will skin you like a mackerel! I've got it! Great. Now you can tear it to bits. Hang on. Have you thought about this? Your job came in pretty handy for us. Time's up. There's a month left. Nataša. Nataša! Since time immemorial, all parents have shared one great dream. To send their child away for as long as possible. My time has come. Hello, hello? Is Mama going to say hello, hello? -Hi. -Hi. How are you two? Good. How's the kid? Is he behaving? Yeah. He's a really good boy. Another bubble? Okay. Make sure he listens to his mom. I'll tell him that. Listen. Could I at least take him for the weekend? Time's still not up. Okay then. Meanwhile, Čeněk was in bed grumbling loudly and made his dissatisfaction clear by rattling the rails on his bed. His cries were like a balm for my nerves. I took the child from his bed and put him in the playpen and brought him the mop. Čeněk purred with contentment. I don't know if babies can purr, but it seems so. It looks like you'll have to rewrite the last chapter, coach. Is it really that bad? It's bad. Time's run out. I screwed everything up. Last weekend with this devil incarnate. Look, this is the third line. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. You did something stupid. You know full well what I think of your pact. You've taken care of your kid. You've done it with a sense of humor. You give him lots of love. You're a great dad. How many guys can say that about themselves? Čeněk's the one who's supposed to be whining. I'm going out on the ice, coach. -Go. -I'm going out on the ice! Master plan. To get my family back. First thing, romantic props. Second, romantic words. Third, budget. And fourth, shock. Buddy. Mama's coming for you any minute. Fifth. Don't screw up. DIARY OF A MODERN DAD THE TIME I WAS ON TV A lot of mothers out there are envious of your partner. You're something of a superdad. Do you see yourself that way? Like superdad? Well… I can't throw the kid out on the street, right? And can you tell us about your plans for the future? Your dreams? Well, I want to put on a red cape and fly away to England. To study creative writing. -Hi. -Hi. I… -Are you all packed? -What? We're coming tomorrow for our things. So you can put your red cape on, superman. You saw that interview. That's what you've wanted for ages. I don't need to see an interview to know that. -Let's go. -Hang on. Can't I explain? -Are you all right, you little madman? -What are you playing at? This is what you always wanted. If you're waiting for your chance… I know. Wait! I hate that taxi driver! I hate him! Wait! Wait! Nataša, stop! Nataša! Nataša! Look out! Have you gone mad? I love you! I'm not letting you go! I won't lie to you, this isn't exactly how it played out. But I was thinking that when it comes time to Čeněk telling my grandkids about the time Grandpa tried to save his relationship with Grandma, the story should have some balls. Some of it is true, after all. What are you doing? Have you gone mad? -I'm not letting you go. -So I see. I've canceled the trip to England. I'm not going anywhere. Really? Yes. They've already returned the tuition. So I put it in an account for Čeněk. The kid's loaded now. I'd be a fool to leave him to you. I want to propose a new pact. For our whole lives. But you have to give me a chance. Give me a chance to show my son how much I love his mom. So you'll marry me? We don't want to rush it though. Okay. You have to say yes, or they won't accept it. Yes! 1 YEAR I guess that's about it. I've set that adorable, ever-poopy little sweetheart down right under your nose. But this is only the beginning. The worst is yet to come. Buddy? I have to tell you something. Welcome to the world of the modern dad. Welcome to hell. Subtitle translation by: Christian Falvey
