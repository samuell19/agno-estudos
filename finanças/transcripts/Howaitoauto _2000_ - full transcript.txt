The second and third relays are all normal. Release the interlock. Releasing. The relay is normal. Hey! Togashi, where did you go? He's not over here. - Chief. - Yes? Oh my God. Togashi! What are you doing there? Since when did you move to the engineering division? Stop nit-picking. Our job is to protect the dam and supply electricity. You were supposed to go home once your shift ended! Togashi, come back now. What's wrong? I see figures in the mountains behind the ski resort. Switchyard Entrance Wait, both of you! Our job is to operate the dam! Are you saying to let the lost ones die right in front of us? - Hey! - Chief. Don't worry, I'll request paid leave for this. Let's go. Two mountain climbers went missing. They left their hut in early morning, heading for the summit. They lost contact. Two operators from the Okutowa Power Plant are going out to save them. Where were they spotted? Halfway up Mount Senjogadake, about 500m from Ojirosawa. Our maintenance workers may have found them. The blizzard is expected to get worse. Be careful. Kenji, get a warm bath ready. Okay. How is it? Are you okay? Are you okay? Why did they come in such light clothing? What idiots. You're going to be okay. Are you okay? We'll need to carry him. The two missing mountain climbers were confirmed about 500m from Ojirosawa at Mount Senjogadake. The weather is very bad. Please be careful. Do you need help? I'm fine. Okay. Help me. - Help me. - Stay still! Yoshioka! Are you okay? My right leg is messed up. This is Togashi. Switchyard, please respond. Switchyard! Togashi. Togashi, go yourself. - Don't be an idiot. - Who's the idiot here? Go and get the rescue team. We'll make a bivouac and wait for the wind to calm. Do you think he'll last until the morning? You're not confident? Who are you talking to? You. Go and get the rescue. Hey. Of course I have a compass. I'll borrow it. This is Niigata HQ, calling Mount Okutowa Rescue Team. This is the Mount Okutowa Rescue Team. Loud and clear. Over. Currently in Okutowa there's a heavy snow, strong wind, and snow accretion advisory. They're predicting a whiteout. Be careful not to get... Togashi, respond. Togashi! Togashi, can you hear me? Respond! Togashi! Togashi, can you hear me? Yoshioka. Where's Yoshioka? No. How is he? - Yoshioka! - Yoshioka. Yoshioka! Yoshioka! Hey. Hey! He sacrificed himself, to protect the others. Chiaki... - Excuse me. - Yes? May I ask where I can find Hirakawa Chiaki? She went out. Okay. May I know your name? It's nothing. Never mind. There's a matchmaking party with the PR department. They really want you there, Chiaki! You're already counted as one of the attendants. What's the matter, Chiaki? Thank you for coming all the way far inside the mountain. No, I should thank you for meeting me. Are we okay in this weather? It's always like this at this time of year. Even the ski resort closes because it's dangerous. So... shall we stop by the power station to check the situation? No, please take me to the dam. Understood. Yoshioka, he also mentioned that he wanted to show you Okutowa in the winter someday. He wanted you to hear the sound of the snow accumulating. Also... there's someone waiting for you at the dam. He insists on giving you something. Hey, someone's there! Bring the binoculars. How dangerous. If you're cold, I have some extra clothes you can put on. No, I've come prepared. What happened? Someone's climbing. That's weird in this season. Don't worry. - The lift works, right? - Yes. This is the last tunnel. Driving this kind of road... Every day... This dam keeps the largest volume of water in Japan. It's only possible deep inside the mountains. To us, this road is like a lifeline. Silver Line No. 17 - Hey, Kenji. - Yes? Were we expecting TV interviews? No. Niigata Central Television? What the heck are they doing? What's this? Sorry. Just a moment. Normal vehicles aren't allowed to enter until March. It was written on the entrance. Hey! What are you doing? Hey! Open up! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Murase! What happened? You're late. You can't just barge in! What are you doing? Hello? What do you think you're doing? I'm cutting off the circuit of microwave radio remote control system. Why? Preparations should be complete for the system operations in April. In short, nine power plants, including this one can now be controlled by remote control. Wait. You can't cut off the circuit! This isn't a joke! It's programmed so that if some outsider messes it up the computers will all stop! Don't lie. We've done our research. Stop it, Totsuka. What a pity. He's in pain. Plus... that whining sound the injured makes is annoying. This is the control room. What's the situation there? This is Rest House. I was interrupted. I managed to kill one but another one escaped. Where did you lose him? Behind the ski lodge. He's in a khaki anorak. Minagawa. Khaki... It's Togashi. Togashi? Hey! He's there! Who the hell are they? Stop! And then? You just retreated like that? Look at this snow. He can't last long alone. Strengthen the patrol. He's very cautious. His moves are very agile for a mere operator. He knows the dam far better than us. Finished? Now the nine dams are ours. What the hell are they up to? Nagami Police Station Chief! Chief, there's a weird radio signal in the wide area system. Chief, come quick! I'm coming. - Hurry! - Okay! Here he is. Chief, hurry! This is Nagami Police Station. This is the Okutowa Power Plant. I appreciate you responding. Did something happen over there? Over. Listen calmly. We have taken over all of the dams and switchyard. I repeat. We have taken over the power plants. We have all of the operators and staff under our surveillance. Wait. I don't get what you're saying. Relax. You will find out soon. Kitanihon E.P.G., Nagami Branch Remote Communication Control What happened? The surveillance monitor of the dam is switched off. Hamanaka! I can't get hold of the line to the dam. Call all the cars on patrol. Have them go to the dam immediately. - Hurry! - Yes, sir. There is a strange footage in the surveillance monitor of the power company. Hey! What happened? What? The light went out? Contact the power company! Switch to emergency backup! Find the scope of the blackout. Contact the emergency headquarters. No. - Inform the National Police Agency. - Yes, sir. Something moved above the tunnel. Stop! They'll notice. It might be Togashi. He will manage to contact the police. He will. He definitely will. He won't come. He's just running away. Hello? Hello? Boss. Boss! Boss! Boss! 10 February (Thursday) No Service To Taihaku Dam... Taihaku Dam it's 8km away. Power's coming back from the Kansai Power! We've got a message. - Record it. - Yes. Connect to the prefectural and national police. This is Okutowa Power Plant. I don't want to mess with you. I want to confirm the hostages. Were you able to get hold of the big ones in the government? Unfortunately, the Prime Minister is in a meeting. I will listen to your requests. Within the next 24 hours provide five billion yen in cash with unsorted number codes. Five billion? - Five billion. - I repeat. Within 24 hours, get five billion yen ready. If you don't comply we will kill the hostages and blow up the dam. No! Tunnel No. 17 is totally blocked! Okutowa Silver Line He screwed us over just by blowing up... one road. The prefectural police are here. Nagami Police Station Change the switchyard patrol every two hours. Continue. Understood. What are you doing? Totsuka! Don't do anything stupid. Based on the tunnel explosion we believe the criminals have a large amount of explosives. The hostages? Including the operators and ski security, there are 17. And this footage? We went through the Nagami Electric Power Station's monitor. Eight days ago, a broadcasting van from Niigata Central TV was stolen. They're quite organised. No. I can't do it! Do it. There's no prospect of restoring the exploded Silver Line. There's a road that crosses Hashigozaka Pass and goes west of the lake but it's covered in snow now. We thought of crossing them with snowmobiles but the undulations are severe in the mountain pass. Plus, in this weather... How about a helicopter? - Inform the Self-Defence Forces. - Yes, sir. We've already spoken to them. Hey. Even the SDF helicopters won't be able to go out in a blizzard like this. There's no one way to the dam? There's none. The criminals likely planned it this way, targeting Okutowa. It's absolutely isolated. No. It's a fort... protected by snow. We have two chances of arresting them. One is when we give them the money. The other is when they leave. No matter how fortified they'll need to show up at least those two times. How are they even planning to get out? They'll call a helicopter once the weather improves. Meaning we need to prepare the money within 24 hours... It's just a threat. We should delay the negotiation. Hey, how long does it take to open the route to the dam? Aren't you forgetting something crucial? - What? - Well... The water from the dam will still be under their control. The water of the dam? Okutowa Dam contains the highest volume in Japan. 600 million cubic metres. If it's released all at once... Okutowa Dam The six dams downstream won't be able to stop the volume of water. There's a danger of it bursting. Right. Then the 200,000 households at the basin... A message! - Start recording! - Yes, sir! I'm speaking from the Okutowa Power Plant. Give me your official answer soon. Government leaders in Tokyo are holding an emergency meeting. Wait a bit longer. It seems you still don't get how powerful we are. You have until noon tomorrow. I'm expecting a favourable response from you by then. I'll contact you again in 20 hours. Broadcasting Van Contact 2.03pm Chief! The station downstream says the discharge alarm is going off. - What? - Check it immediately! The downstream police and fire stations and city and village halls! Contact them all! Hurry! - Yes, sir! - Wait! We will be giving instructions. Don't do anything unnecessary. Okutowa Dam Staff Only Drainpipe gate room. Hello? What happened? Hey! 2.08pm You prepared a lot. It's also for the hostages inside the power plant. How long are you planning to discharge? Why are you here? If we just let it be, it won't be a mere threat. Right when I thought you had something to say. If the dams downstream burst there is no point for the governments to respond to our requests. You don't need to save your brother? You have no right to command me. - None! - Hey! The noise stopped. What's this, Kasahara? The valve can only be controlled from the gate room. Did he do this? Pump Operations Closing Come on, close! Quick! He's not just some operator. Kaneko's in the gate room. This is the control room. It seems Kaneko's done. Go down to the dam again. Discharge Gate Control Panel Please. Let the people in the power plant eat as well. You won't let them have any food or water? Please, at least let them have water. Go ahead. Adjust the AC again. Togashi... He's still alive. To prepare for leakage accidents there are oxygen tanks and masks in the generator room. There is a generator? Do you hear me? Another one of your goons is dead. Who's next? Come down if you want to die! This dam... is not your plaything. You've done well. It's just that you've forgotten one important thing. Togashi, you did a good job. I want to see a bit more of what you can do but if I do, your friends will sink to the bottom of the dam one by one. Hey. Chief! The video of the monitor is gone. What, is he threatening us now? It's gone? If you exit the dam quietly all of your colleagues will be free. Togashi, don't let them fool you! Even if you leave, they will just kill you! Many of your colleagues are still here, Togashi. What happened? He blew the circuit of the phone connected to the dam. Darn it. Really? If he cares about the dam so much, let's let him die here. Hey! Seal the dam. He won't come out. He'll just escape... alone again. These thugs. Darn it. I'm in front of Nagami Police Station in Niigata where they're commanding measures for the Okutowa Dam takeover. According to the press release at 7.00pm today communication with the criminals ceased since noon... This isn't a joke. Doesn't Tokyo get what's going on? What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for the dam to break and flood the town? Now the government task force is taking the lead. When we get our next radio contact, connect to Tokyo. This doesn't mean there's nothing we can do. Hamanaka Takanobu Chief. The woman visiting was the fiancée of a worker who died in this accident. Okutowa Dam Worker Dies During Rescue Yoshioka Kazushi? It's time. Kasahara! What's this? All the generators stopped. All the dam's power generation stopped at 6.55pm. What's this? What's the point of stopping them now? Come on, Taihaku dam. If he wants to stop our electricity supply... all he needs to do is cut the circuit. Someone's there. There's no doubt. Someone's at the dam fighting the criminals! Really? There was a way out. The water spinning the generator turbine all goes through this draft tube. It then goes through the drainpipe 3km to the port. Could he have possibly... The water will recede if you stop the generator. 3km down... in the water, in the middle of winter. They're here. He's coming from Tube Three. Discharge it now. Wash him away. Not yet? Draft Tube He won't make it. He won't have time to reach the wastewater port. Don't give up. I'm sure Togashi... He'll contact the police from Taihaku Dam. This is the last one. This storm will be over tomorrow. Hey, Togashi. I'm getting married. Really? Wow, congratulations! Thanks. To whom? You haven't met her. Is she cute? Kind of. Don't mess around. If something ever happens to me... take care of her. Don't say things like that. I don't think I'll be able to leave the mountains. I'm the same. And also... if we both get lost now how can I save her? You have a point there. The Metropolitan Police Special Forces are stranded at the pass. See? I said it was a fort protected by snow. - Chief, they'll contact us soon. - Okay. We have radio contact! Tokyo's connected, right? Yes. They changed the hostage! This is the Okutowa Power Plant. The radio has switched to Tokyo. I'm Fujimaki of the National Police Agency. Do you hear me? Did you prepare the five billion yen? It is a lot of money. We're doing our best, but we need more time... That was just a test shot. Next time, I'll blow off his head just like a watermelon. Or maybe I'll discharge the dam again. Which do you prefer? Wait. Don't be rash. I'll give you 10 seconds to deliberate. One. Wait. - Two. - How should we deliver the money? - Three. - It's impossible in that weather. - Plus, we need more time. - Four. Five. Six. Seven. - Eight. - Fine. We'll prepare... the money now. Deal. I'll call you right again at 12.00 sharp. I want to change the bandage. I want you to do it. I like... a tough woman like you. That's enough. Go back to the control room now. You just want to have fun with her all to yourself? Where's the energy you showed me just now, huh? Give it back. Don't come near me. If you do, I'll shoot. I'm not interested in your body. Give me the gun. Remember this. The gun has a safety lock. Go to the staff dorm. Switch with Sakashita. Nagami Police Station Five Billion We've got a radio call. It's 12.00pm. Are you ready? We have the money. What should we do? Take it to the Swiss Central Bank Tokyo branch immediately. Convert it to cheques in USD of 10 million yen each. Cheques in US dollars? One hour should be enough time. Fine. Are the hostages okay? It's up to you. Prepare a helicopter... at Niigata Airport. Put the Coast Guard's Echigo on standby to take off at any time. I'll contact you again in one hour. So they are using a helicopter. It's a helicopter that can fly the longest range at Niigata Airport. - How far can it go? - About 1,000km. Are they planning to go abroad? Or they have someone with a ship waiting for them on water. - Get the Echigo. - Yes, sir. It's Togashi? It's really Togashi? Connect the radio communication, now! The one that got in Taihaku Dam is not the criminal. It's Togashi Teruo, our operator who we thought was a hostage! We have contact! Hey! This is Okuda from the Nagami Police Station. Can you hear me? Yes. I can hear you. How the hell did you manage to escape from Okutowa? Before I explain... I have some bad news. Murase and... Chief Iwazaki... and possibly... Hamanaka Chief Operator, they are all dead. Are you okay? I just walked here from Okutowa. I still... can't feel my fingertips. He walked? You walked? And also... one of... the terrorists was... Yamazaki Masamichi. Driver's Licence He was born in 1973... Hold on. How do you know that? I have... his driver's licence here. Two of them... no, maybe... three... I've killed three of them. Director-general! I heard they just got an order from the criminals. Where? The bank. The criminals called the Tokyo branch of the Swiss Central Bank. They ordered them to send all of the money to an anonymous account in Zürich. So the phone line wasn't cut after all? They're saying if they can't confirm the money they'll blow up the dam together with the hostages. But how are they planning to confirm the money? It's possible by reconnecting the phone line. Can you hear me, Togashi? Yes. I'm here. I'm wondering... if they weren't using the phone line how were they making their orders? The radio. And they used the surveillance monitors to send images of the hostages. Does that mean anything to you? They set up a parabolic antenna on top of the rest house. A parabolic antenna? - You're sure? - Yes. The Taihaku Dam generator is working. Are the police involved? How would the police get into Taihaku Dam? There's no route to it. - Is he still alive? - Don't be crazy. How did he survive that flood? Wait. If that's true you were flushed through the drainpipe? In that case, it's amazing you walked to Taihaku Dam. Togashi. That's insane. I'm used to the snowy mountains. I had a friend... I used to always go climbing with. I can't... do anything that would embarrass me if he'd known. Really? It seems you had a really good friend. You must be tired. Unfortunately, all our routes are cut off. Rest there until we can come and save you. Hello? Can you hear me? I'm going to... return to Okutowa. What are you saying? I made a promise... to return no matter what. What? That's our job. You're fine! Just stay there and rest. What more do you think you can do with your body? Hello? Are you listening? - Don't be a fool. - Stop it there. What time did you start the generator this morning? 7.25am. Six and a half hours. Next time, it'll be 9.00pm. Next time? It's when he'll return. Why is he coming back? He managed to escape to somewhere safe. How many of our men were killed because we underestimated him? Inspection Gallery No. 12 is almost ready. How long will the bank transfer to the main branch take? It'll take five hours at the latest. We've been given until 8.00pm. Parabolic Antenna Parabolic. Broadcasting van. Five billion. Helicopter. Photo Comparison: Yamazaki Masamichi / Nakagaki Ken It's here! Nakagaki? He's a member of the Red Moon. So they are an extremist organisation! The Red Moon means... Utsugi might be there. The truth is, when the Red Moon blew this place up a member of a worker's family was in the building visiting and died. That worker was never... Koshiba Takuya Current Location: Unknown Koshiba Takuya. He retired half a year after the explosion. He was in the power station's planning department. Are you saying that the man whose family was killed by the Red Moon is helping them? It seems they got the photo of Koshiba! - Forward it! - Yes, sir! Koshiba Takuya Togashi! Togashi, go on your own. You're not confident? Go and get the rescue team. It doesn't seem to make sense. Why aren't they asking us to release the other members who are in prison? This needs to be solved immediately. Go. Make the demand now. Once the weather improves I'll send the Police Department's sniper unit into Okutowa. - Chief! - Stop! - I need to report this! - I said stop! You. Aren't you the prefectural police? - What are you talking about? - About the sniper unit! What happens if they get caught and the criminals blow up the dam? The dam's downstream have already started discharging. You think you can stop 600 million tons of water? The Ministry of Construction judged they can take it. Go ahead, let terrorists run away with five billion yen. The entire world will laugh at the Japanese Police Agency. You're abandoning the residents! Shut up! This is the government's decision. The pressure patterns bringing the heavy snow have abated and the weather is expected to improve. The Sea of Japan will see better weather late tonight at the earliest. Snow will cease in the mountains at dawn. I didn't expect to be so on guard against just one man. ...eastern areas: southwest wind and partly cloudy. This is the Control Room. Are you ready yet? The upper inspection galleries are ready. We're heading to watch the crown now. This is the Control Room. We are ready. Okutowa Staff Dorm This all ends tomorrow. We are leaving Okutowa. This will be a long night. Stay vigilant. Chief! Chief. It turns out one more broadcasting van was stolen near Nagoya. - Another one? - Yes. It happened two months ago. The way it was stolen was very similar to the one in Niigata. Two Broadcasting Vans That's it. You have until noon tomorrow. I'm expecting a favourable response by then. I'll contact you again in 20 hours. You have until noon tomorrow. I'm expecting a favourable response by then. I'll contact you again in 20 hours. So what? I don't hear anything special. Yeah. The problem is that we don't hear anything. What time was the dam discharged yesterday? I think it was 1.54pm. And when did we get this radio contact? 2.03pm. The dam discharging makes a tremendous noise. That's right. The noise! We can't hear it at all! There's no way we wouldn't hear it if they were in the switchyard. What does this mean? The person who is radioing us... wasn't at the dam. This means... we weren't talking to the criminals occupying the dam. So then who the hell were we talking to? This is Sakashita. Control Room, respond. This is Sakashita. Commander, do you hear me? This is Kasahara. Commander, please respond. This is Kasahara. Commander... Commander, respond. This is the Control Room. Are the radio waves jammed? The police? This is Okutowa Power Plant. Nagami Police Station, respond. This is Okutowa. This is Nagami Police Station. What's next? I'm checking just in case. Have our friends been released yet? Police vans are coming from all over the country. All of the five Red Moon members are accounted for. As soon as the weather improves... we will send you the five billion and a helicopter. This is Okutowa Power Plant. Nagami Police Station, do you read me? We've received the five billion. The weather is predicted to improve a bit tomorrow afternoon. Is the helicopter ready? I will contact you again tomorrow. Thanks for your effort. - Hey, Sasaki. - Yes? Why are they asking us for a helicopter and have the five billion transferred? I'm not sure. Listen, they're planning to escape abroad. Imagine how heavy five billion is. They will need two helicopters. Two? There are two broadcasting vans. What are you saying? - Hey! - Yes? - Look into the helicopter! - What? - The helicopter is as they wanted. - That's not it! There might be one more helicopter. Do you see? The criminals might also be somewhere else besides the dam. What if another helicopter is there? While we send one helicopter here they could easily escape. They already have the five billion. But... what happens to those at the dam? That I don't know. What were you talking about without me? Nothing. I couldn't contact the commander... So then why didn't you talk to me? Don't worry. The radio's broken. Go back to your post. You're also away from your post. This is Kuwana. Something weird has happened. One snowmobile is missing. Don't be stupid! Then why is the remote controller for the explosives also gone? I don't believe it. Where are you going? You idiot! Hey! It's a camera and a relay. Why are they here? Obviously to monitor us. - Where are you going? - Don't you get it? They're abandoning us! Utsugi's on a snowmobile as we speak. He's with the remote controller of the explosives. Wait! Aren't you also planning something stupid? Your brother might stay in prison for the rest of his life. Calm down! Let go! Don't move! Run! Do you hear me? Kasahara betrayed us! He left with the woman! Hand over the gun. Do you think you can shoot me? What are you thinking? Get on! Or do you want them to kill you? Get on! Togashi. - Are you okay? - Thank God. - Kenji. - Togashi. Chiaki... Is she with them? They lost the remote controller for the explosives. So if we stay... What? There's a remote controller? Yes. - Please. - Togashi. Look! He's planning to escape alone. But what about the radio contact from the police? Utsugi was doing it all. We haven't talked to the police ourselves at all. He's been planning to abandon us all along. Chief! We found it! It's in Tokorozawa. A helicopter that can go over 2,000-metre mountains was chartered out a week ago. A place where they could connect the surveillance monitor and the helicopter could land... Katagai Dam! Commander. Could you please stand? You can stand, can't you? What's this? You knew? Koshiba Takuya. Isn't that your name? You joined us to eradicate the Red Moon. If you bring us the plan to blow up the dam we would certainly demand the release of your friend. Wasn't that what you planned? I'm sorry it didn't go as you hoped. Why? Why do you throw away friends like they're a trash? Isn't this the organisation you founded? Organisation? For me, it was a continuous disappointment. That's why I made a grave for myself. I decided to delete all this foolish time in delirium in the Okutowa Lake along with that dam. We did this for you! Hey. I'll come back for you. Bravo. Hey! Are you okay? Why did they come in such light clothing? We'll need to carry him. What the hell? What did Yoshioka die for? Wait. Wait. Wait. I'll call the rescue. Wait. Where are they? Understood. Please check the names of the survivors. Hey! Chief! Over there. It's Togashi. Togashi! I'm Okuda from the Nagami Police Station. He's in the helicopter. He... saved me. He said he would. He handed you over to us saying... "Help Yoshioka." "Quickly, call the rescue." "Yoshioka is waiting with the two victims." His memory is probably a bit confused. He got there in time. It was three months late... but he... finally made it.
