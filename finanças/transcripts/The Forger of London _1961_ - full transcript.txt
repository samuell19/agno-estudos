One, Two, Three Start! Go on! Go on! Faster! Faster! Uncle John, look at our horse He's winning! Fantastic! Bravo! He's still first, Bravo! He's won He did it! - Congratulations Jane. - Thank you. A lesson Donald, we should learn not to bet on longshots quite so often. With women, you're much luckier. With all except you. Sorry Peter, but I'm mad about your bride to be. Then our new family will require a new doctor. Very wise of you, I must warn you that Doctor Wells writes big bills as amusement. Talking of finances, would you Uncle John? - Oh but of course. - Thank you. - Hello Peter. - Oh Ted Burke I have to speak to him for a moment. Excuse me dear. Do you know, Donald How come peter is so friendly with the chief inspector of Scotland Yard. No idea, it cant hurt though having a policeman for a friend. - Hello Burke. - Hello Peter. Since when did you start following the horses? Actually I prefer football, Real Madrid and Birmingham play today. At the moment 6 to 2 favour the Spaniards, but it's not over yet. - What brings you here then? - I'm here on business. There is a lot of money here. In banknotes. Ah of course. You're on the lookout for that forger. In the past week, a great many five pound notes have turned up. - Watch out you don't get stuck Peter. - Thanks for the tip. Quite alright. What's happening? Another goal for the Spaniards. - See you tomorrow? - I'll be there. Your wedding is one thing I'm not going to miss. You're lucky, Jane. - Thank you. - You got top odds, Eighty for Ten. - I'll try my luck again. - You dreamer. - Her Majesty. - The Queen. - Peter, I'm betting on this race, come along. - Not right now Donald... I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing I love Jane But I don't want to bring her any sorrow. That's a lot of nonsense. By tomorrow you're the envy of all London You're a wonderful couple indeed. You're to be envied my friend. What is it Jane? You look worried. - The lucky bride should be... - I'm not the lucky bride. I don't think I'll go through with it My love is not enough for him. Oh you must stop this Jane Don't be so foolish dear. Before she died, I promised your mother I'd look after you. And now you've found Peter, Peter is the finest, the best of men - your Mother would have said... - Yes, yes of course. Look Jane I'm getting old, I'm not too well I want to see you happily married. Why does Peter want to marry me? I can't believe he loves me so. How can you feel that way? He'd never have asked you to marry him if he didn't love you. - Hello Jane. - Hello Basil. - Mr Leith. - Hello Hale I just wanted to have a look at the blushing bride here. Lovely as ever. Listen Jane, why don't you go dancing with me for the last time. - Basil.. You're impossible - No more so than your fianc?, Peter Clifton I must admit, I never thought you'd marry him. We might have had so much good fun my dear. Never mind your foolishness Hale, it might not amuse Peter. Well.. Good day Clifton, I've just made my last effort to take your fianc? away. It's impossible I'm afraid. Still, I expect an invitation to attend your wedding. Don't count on it Hale! - Give up will you Hale. - Give up.. Why? I might hold a trump you know. Then play it. Don't talk. All things in good time... my dear boy. Five pounds on lord Byron. Thanks. Come over here, this note is forged on the reverse side it's stamped. Dr Donald Wells. This is certainly his poorest job to date They've been getting progressively worse. That hundred dollar note last year wasn't too bad. Come look at this one. Here, here and here. Remarkably careless work, for such an expert. No doubt he's getting overconfident. Not very likely. I see you still cant resist jumping to easy conclusions. But your deduction is incorrect Stanley. You see our forger is only a man. He has to have some off days, we all do. He has his weaknesses. Yes that's true of course. But how do we explain such obvious carelessness? Perhaps he's... And what if this five pound note isn't his work? This note is his work as sure as two and two equals four. That I can prove to you. Simply compare this five pound note with the ten pound note, he made three years ago. It was a fine job, but it revealed a flaw on the left side I'll pick it up Stanley. The press treat him like a film star. Yes, you see the mistakes on this note are almost identical with that one of three years ago. Conclusive prove it's the same man. Sorry Stanley, it can hardly be called conclusive. - It could very well be coincidence. - I can't accept that Chief Inspector. No, I put my bet on my theory It's his work alright, I'm sure. And if his work is this poor a clumsy forger is easier to catch. And this great forger could fall into our hands. In time Stanley. But when a criminal knows he's made mistakes he becomes savage, and much more dangerous. It takes over his thinking. And I'm absolutely sure he would resort to murder if needed. Ah Bert, I'm glad Scotland Yard could be here. Have no fear, Peter. The whiskey and I agree splendidly. Oh Doctor, do you have a moment to spare? This is inspector Rouper, my associate. - One question he'd like to ask you. - This bank note, did you use it? - It has your name stamped on it. - Yes I could have I did bet, only yesterday A five pound note, it's true. But who knows if it's the same one. In any case, you did pass it. - So? - It's forged. - How did it come into your possession? - Yes, I recall. - A patient, he paid his bill with it. - Where is the patient? Well he's right here... Mr Clifton. Mr Clifton, where did you get it? That question is difficult, It could be a bank I don't keep a record book I'm not used to my bills being stamped. That's enough Rouper... Mr Clifton will inform us if he learns anything, come on.. I don't like it Peter... Isn't the Chief inspector supposed to be your friend? As your guest, he should have tried to prevent this embarrassment. Come on, let's get a drink. An inspector from Scotland Yard here on business could be ill at ease, - but as a guest you're welcome. - Thank you, but you know I don't drink I though you would have joined me in a toast to the capture of the forger. - Tonight, yes Chief Inspector. - Of course, cheers. Inspector Rouper behaves as if you forged that note yourself. Why it's possible for anyone to have such a banknote and not know it. This forger seems a very talented fellow indeed. Unfortunate, such talent the Bank of England could use I prefer talent, did you know Peter is a copper plate engraving genius? Yes, Uncle John let me take a look at some of his etchings. It's a hobby, I do very little. If I was blessed with half your talent Peter, I might have done paintings that were acknowledged. Tell me, have you found that printing plate that you borrowed from Peter some time ago? I'm afraid not, and I believe you're mistaken Peter, I'm sure I gave them all back. But I'm not worried at all, if you find it, good... if not, no loss. My goodness, it's Hale. Well here I am... There you are... I do hope you're having fun. Now a toast, I wish you both a jolly wedding night. And a house full of little kiddies. As it says in the bible, be fruitful and multiply. And I will drink to the women, girls everywhere by the millions, Poor but pretty, and marry for money. He's drunk, no Peter I know exactly what's happening here. You gave up your affection for me, so your poor stupid sick uncle could stop being a kitsch postcard Picasso, and have security and comfort. Your motives are admirable. - For you.. - This is for you! Better open the door. I'm sorry Jane... I must say this, your wedding day has certainly been full of surprises. May your lives together continue to be as exciting. To get to Longford Castle by daylight, we have to leave right away, excuse me. What luck you have dear, that awful castle he chooses for a honeymoon. Mr Hale, you have a message. - Who gave this to you? - I didn't recognise him. Goodbye, thanks for coming... Stop! Peter Clifton! I caught you before you got away Stop! You can't avoid me I'm aware of that I've been through all this before I'm Mrs Anderson, of course he's never told you about me. We will not hold a discussion here We can talk when I return to town. One moment! I want this girl to know the man she's going to live with. Calm down and hold your tongue! You're guilty of stealing his inheritance, the birthright of your own brother. She's off her head, come.. Don't believe a word of it, the woman is mad! Stop! If the day comes and I think you're getting away with any of this I'll be ready to shoot you down like a filthy dog! You better watch what you're saying you hysterical fool. It is foolish Mrs Anderson... What you are saying can have value for the police, and shouldn't be publicly announced like this. Why are you butting in? I'm a friend of the accused, Peter Clifton. Why didn't you tell me you had a brother? I didn't want to bother you with the affairs of my family. I was wrong, it's my fault. - What she said, is it true? - Of course not! Sorry, I'm a bit upset I suppose That stupid scene with the banknote. Those men from Scotland Yard, then that scene with Mrs Anderson, have me on edge. Perhaps we would have been better off with a honeymoon in Rhodesia. - Do you have a goldmine there? - Why do you ask that? Just that, you're a rich man uncle John says you're quite wealthy. That money was left to me by my father There's no mystery. Why did you decide on Longford Castle, do you own it? - No, I simply rented it for a few weeks. - Ever been there? Yes, uncle John recommended it, you'll find it comfortable I hope we're done with those nerve racking surprises at last, like Mrs Anderson.. Don't worry... I'm not going to let my family problems accompany us. Especially not now... He's coming, go! Why?, he can't see in through the mirror I told you to go! Ahh, Mr Basil Hale And what can I do for you? Here, you told me to come. I know.. I know. You wanted to speak to me, Mr Blonberg? Yes, to warn you once more, stay away from Jane. Why? She attracts me, and I like the game. It's my private affair anyway. As long as it doesn't interfere with business, I don't care how many women you chase. But with Jane, I have my own plans, is that clear? I hear you.. You can go now Well, what is it? - Some more cash. - 200 pounds just three days ago? A shabby 200 pounds... It's not my affair if you can't manage your money. Now get out of here before I get angry Out! - Is there something I can get you Sir? - No thank you James, that'll be all. You seem to be in rather a strange mood, you don't look very happy. Really? I'm afraid this isn't really the time to talk about it, but I want you to know, that I plan to deposit 100.000 pounds in an account for you. That's generous. - It's just money.. - It's a fortune, really. Apparently you think it's enough to buy a woman Jane... It's most convenient for you to buy a woman, isn't it? Except for one thing, you may never buy my love Jane, I know all that, but... I love you... As my husband, you have rights I want only what you are prepared to give me. Then I'm afraid we have nothing more to say. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Who's there please? - It's me madam. - I have been waiting. - Thank you. - Who live in this room before? - Oh nobody lived here. - Why not? It's a nice room. - I don't know. You must know who owns the house... An old gentleman who lives abroad, if he's still among the living. The manager is Blonberg. Sometimes he comes and stays here for a while madam, but I don't see him. What, you mean you've never seen him? No madam, when Mr Blonberg comes, he brings his own staff, a filthy bunch. They leave the place like a pig sty, the filthy pigs. Where are you when Mr Blonbergs here? I stay with my brother in London, we're all given leave with full pay. Is there anything else I can do for you madam? No thank you. - Then goodnight. - Goodnight Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Yes, what is it? Jane! Oh Peter, a man was in my room just now, I'm so frightened, where were you - I've been in your room looking. - A man in your room you know who... No, I thought he came in from outside and then I thought maybe it was you. But I was down here in... the hall, you wait here, I'll be right back I've looked everywhere, I saw no one Jane, you'll catch a cold, come up to your room. No, thank you, I'm all right. Please connect me with London West End 4316. You can't imagine how disturbed I am. Is it at all likely Peter, that the man she saw was you? That's what's so un-nerving, I have no idea whether I was in her room last night or not I think when she called out, I was... downstairs. - Help me Wells, I must know the truth. - We will see. But in your case, I don't think you would have forgotten. I recall your father had an illness, that you fear was hereditary. That doesn't mean you must be sick too. You must believe that you're well and normal. You must be upset, but I think your fears are unfounded. After all, didn't professor Clores clearly say so? And he's a respected colleague. Do you know Anna where the keys are for the upstairs room? - Well Mr Clifton had them, but I... - It's alright, I can find them. Did you find the keys? Oh yes, one question Anna, when did Mr Blonberg last come? The beginning of April, madam. - Stayed long? - No, only one night. Most of the time, Mr Blonberg comes in the evening and leaves in the morning. Thank you. Yes of course Peter, if it helps you relax, I'll stay and be glad to. Thank you Donald, I'm in your debt of course. Oh, you have company. - Good morning Donald. - Good morning I've prevailed on Donald to spend a few days with us. We have some matters we have to discuss. Yes, I ought to give my Marjorie a call. - The telephone is in the hall. - Oh thanks. - Say hello to Marjorie for us. - Of course Peter, there's something I must show you Is this that lost plate? - I found it in your room in a cabinet. - You've gone through my things! - Why shouldn't I? - Jane excuse me, I'm shaky and nervous. In my things you say? It seems uncle John gave all the plates back then. I guess it was packed into my luggage somehow I've barely left London, and my Marjorie is stepping out. Well I would say any tired marriage needs something new eh? Or it'll get dull. A man sometimes meets the right person, a little too late. Oh but Marjorie is right for you. Yes of course, but knowing you, I draw parallels. I thought you were Peters friend. True, but imagine what I would do if I were not his friend. What you would do, is of no interest. Hello Jane, I hope you're not frightened to see me. You are mad, to risk getting another beating... What do you want? I brought Marjorie here, and I knew I would see you meanwhile. How are you, are you contented? No worries? None of your business! You have to know, although you're his wife now. I love you Jane. Leave me alone, get lost.. Vanish! Alright, I will... lots of luck. Of course you know that Clifton married you under a false name. What do you mean by that? Didn't he tell you that Wellerson is his name? Wellerson? And of course you don't know why Dr Wells is staying here with him. Because Peter got from his father, not just money he also inherited his madness. That's a lie! That Wellerson was mad, and died a prisoner in Dartmoor. After he murdered to innocent victims for no reason. Now Peter calls himself Clifton, he's mad! That's why.. You liar... Don't believe me? Just ask Dr Wells. I think you should realise what kind of man your stupid uncle chose for you I warn you Jane, you're playing with a madman. Hale! What are you looking for here? Peter.. Do you dare to come here? I thought I ought to open Jane's eyes for her. One moment, Hale.. All of this nonsense, we'll talk about later on.. But I'm going to straighten you out now, for something else. This must be a joke.. You sneaked into my wife's room last night. It's time you learned not to insult Jane, and I'm going to give you the lesson Peter! Peter! Careful! Hale! What are you doing? - Now Jane, go! - Donald... Donald! You might need this knife when you learn how to use it. I'm not yet finished with you Peter Wellerson! But I'm through with you. - How come that Hale is here? - He brought me out here. You have a special gift for the complicating things. Blinded by love, I must look after the fellow Peter, you were absolutely marvellous I really thought that you might kill him. - Next time I could do just that. - It was awful.. - What stories did he tell you? - I just can't talk about it now. Forget about Jane, of course I'm nuts about her, but that isn't why I came here. What would a playboy like you want, other than that? You don't know me Doctor, that's too bad... How about I could tell you things, that'll leave you speechless I'll bet. Longford Castle is a fantastic place, it could be where our forger friend plays his game. - Surprised? - Yes, very surprised. If I wanted to, I could reveal his name. Every now and then, Peter seems so strange, dear Peter isn't insane, if that's what you mean. No dear, but his father was. The scars on his face might remind you, his father threw acid in that face when Peter was a very young boy. Please, I've heard enough. Yes yes, of course, perhaps he just pretends madness. Nonsense, after all, I'm his wife now. Does Donald ever talk to you about Peters illness? No no, remember, a doctor never talks about his patients at any time well Jane, are you a contented wife now? Excuse me, but I could relax now, if... if I knew you were happy. Why? Restless young wives attract men, who are restless after years of marriage - I don't understand. - I speak of my husband. Now listen Peter, I've been thinking, your recent thinking lacks clarity. Now for example, you don't know for sure, if you were in Jane's room or not. - Understand? - Yes. And the etchings you do.. Of course, they're excellent works. But that's not unusual for schizophrenics... I mean that, a talent like you have I can't say for sure, but I can say that Hale, thinks... you're the forger. - That's absurd! - Everything has to be considered Donald, am I imagining that I inherited my fathers illness or am I really... Take it easy now.. I'll give you an injection later, just to calm you. Yes, fine Donald. - Is that you Peter? - No it's me, Jane. I'm sorry Jane, I thought that you were still up. This castle, I can't think of it as home at all. - You might go sleep in your house then. - I would, he doesn't want to. - And how is Peter? - I think he's sleeping. - Donald gave him something to sleep.. - Oh good.. You didn't know that before Donald came here, Thank you. He had a very poor practise in South London, we weren't very well off then. - Matches are over there.. - Thank you. He met Mr Blonberg in London, a hypochondriac. Mr Blonberg, the manager of the castle? - Yes, that's possible, he dabbles in everything. Then he loaned Donald a lot of cash, we moved to the West End, and things looked up. Yes, Donald's good at making impressions. Minds that are sick, need a doctor they can have faith in, that's all. What was that! What... what was that awful scream? No! No! Turn on the light first! What is it? - Nothing.. - Then what was it? Maybe just an owl. - No no, that wasn't an owl, that was a lunatic. Yes... yes, a lunatic Donald once took me into an asylum for lunatics. The things that I saw and heard there.. Shrieks and cries, a man cried out just as if he.. What was that? It's at the door! I'll find out.. - No, don't open that door, I beg you don't! - No ones there at all.. I'm terrified... Jane, come with me to my rooms will you... Surely, if it'll make you feel better. Yes.. - Are you really so frightened? - How frightened I am, you can't imagine. One moment, I'll see if anyone's in my room. - No, Jane, thank you. - Sleep well.. Peter.. Peter.. Hale... you swine! Jane, what are you doing out here in the garden? - I saw you from the window.. - Hale! Is he dead? Yes, he's dead. Skull crushed, with a hammer I guess, or something. Is Peter awake? I have no idea, I haven't been to his room yet. We'll go to him, we must touch nothing here 'till the police come. Open the curtains will you.. What the... What's wrong with him? - I imagine it's the injection you gave him. - Yes, but it should have worn off Peter! Hello.. Peter! Oh.. My poor head, it's going to burst wide open. He's half dressed, where are his other clothes? That's not important now Donald, that was a strong injection you gave me I feel awful.. Yes, it will soon go away. You look at me so strangely, what do you want of me? You should have a sedative Peter, someone was killed in the garden. Killed? Who? Jane found the body, Basil Hale... Hale... was murdered? Do you know who... Drink.. A London newspaper... Yes, printed at 4 o'clock But the body was found at about 7. That means they got an early report. Perhaps it could be the murderer himself. Alright, let's get the stretcher aboard and get moving! Burke! You're here, that's a bit of a surprise.. Well, I don't know about that, Peter I asked the Chief Inspector to come out You know why.. I've no idea.. But Peter, don't you recall? Basil Hale was Brutally murdered. - Yes Peter, we told you about it. - Hale was murdered, when? Last night, probably just after 12. How do you know it was after midnight? Anyway, I slept through it.. Just before 12, Hale gave Scotland Yard a call. He claimed that he knew Longford Castle was the place that the forger worked. He said that a room hidden behind that bookcase, had a complete forgery operation in it. - Forgery here, that bookcase? - Yes, Hale was very specific, come on. Hello, Rouper, what brings you here? You don't mind I hope, Dr Wells asked me to come. Yes, two inspectors can find twice as much. Very good, let's check that room. Well look, now that's a surprise. Our boy is a fast mover.. There's now doubt about it, acids have been used here. Yes, you can see where the printing press was fastened. - Do you believe the forger was in here? - Once again, he's too fast for us. He is clever. Yes, but there's a murder, for which I have our man, Mr Clifton. - You're not serious Inspector. - I am. No, he is not serious, Please ring up Scotland Yard and find out who informed them of the murder I already did that. The telephone operator of the local exchange, said it was Mr Clifton on the line. He recognised the voice from previous calls. Even so Rouper, we can't bring in Mr Clifton until we find the weapon with which Hale was killed. We've found no such weapon, have we? Is it a wonder that the weapon is missing? Do you really expect, the murderer has it in his room? He might think we're that naive. - Who's there? - It's me, Peter. - Why do you lock the door? - No reason. You're packing? You changed my clothes last night.. A bloody shirt doesn't suit you. Your hands had to be washed too. I don't remember that I really killed that man I've been terrified of doing something like... My father.. Jane... I did an awful thing, getting you into this Jane, you can still go away. I'm your wife, and I won't just give you up.. Thank you Jane.. - There must be no secrets between us. - Should I tell Burke everything? No, don't tell him yet, you can tell him about the fight, but no more... Good Jane, you go back to London with Burke. He said he would take you. Oh, but it's here I want to be, dear. No Jane, I must handle this alone. But it means so much that you understand. - That wasn't much of a honeymoon. - I might just go back tomorrow. - Peter loves you, and you? - You have to ask? In London, they feel his money attracted you. That's partially true of course. But my feelings towards Peter changed when I knew of his danger. Funny, Isn't it? I can understand, and I'm glad for Peter. It doesn't look good for him at all. The circumstantial evidence is against him. Too bad the murder weapon didn't turn up. It could change our entire approach. You tell me now, you wouldn't know where the hammer might be? I? How should I? My dear young woman, you want another thousand pounds? - That's a lot of money. - I'm not worth a lot of money? Once my legacy is straightened out, there will be millions in my hands. - It won't go that far now Mrs Anderson. - What are you inferring? You can thank your imbecilic son. Oh but Basil is a clever young fellow You just have something against him! Several times I warned him to leave Jane Clifton alone. Still, he went out to Longford Castle! Oh, but you don't understand. He's a born gentleman who does what he wants to do. Come here, you don't seem to read the newspapers. Basil Hale, murdered on castle grounds? Dead! Dead! Peter Wellerson did it! That beast.. Monster... murderer! My son, my son... May I please speak to Longford Castle Who is this? Oh it's you, listen.. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Thank you. Take it to my room please - I'll unpack the suitcase myself. - Yes madam. A friend of Mr Clifton is here to see you. - My Uncle? - I don't know who it is. Goodbye Mr Burke, and thanks for the ride - I'll wait here for you, if I may.. - Of course.. Bring some tea for Mr Burke. - My name is Radlowe. - Yes? I am Peter's legal adviser I've been reading all the morning papers Embarrassing of course.. I decided to get right over here, and not waste any time. Hale is responsible for it all He's as crazy as his mother. - A stupid old woman, Mrs Anderson. - Anderson? She disrupts my entire office staff when she shows up. Excellent arrangements have been made for her. But she's always short, money always the same. Mrs Anderson is Hale's mother? - In that case, Peter... - Yes.. Annoying situation, I think someone knows too much. This is not good for Peter I'll have to do something to clear Peter of this suspicion. If they read his fathers testament correctly at least, it'll help. It's a mistake for Peter, not to make everything public. Please have him call me immediately. There's no reason for him to hide anything. - Goodbye Madam. - Goodbye. That was Peter's solicitor, what did he want? I missed what he meant, His talk was confusing, he said something must be done now. You're so right Mrs Clifton, the whole situation is confused. But understand, that in theory, I'm always on duty. But I have to relax once in a while. And since ten minutes ago, I'm a civilian, and a very good friend of Peter's and so I'd like to talk about a hammer at this time and of a lost suit, and of course, the bloody shirt. Why mention it to me? If I were sure that they were in the hands of a person who is peter's friend. It would mean that I could relax a little. - The tea. - Thank you, I'll take it. I have a weakness for tea and a weakness for the poor.. - Therefore if you had a secondhand suit.. - Please sit down. Thank you, well if you had an old suit, and an old shirt.. I could make very good use of them. Tools too, few criminals can get honest jobs for lack of good tools. Don't forget Mrs Clifton, Inspector Rouper is looking for used articles, for his own poor. So if you... if you have something you have to get rid of... Then I would rather give it to you, than anyone. That's very good, you know that Mr Rouper could show up with a search warrant soon. - Can you imagine how the police search? - No.. Then I must show you how we proceed. Hello, taxi! Taxi... You wait here! - Stop! Who are you? - My name is Miller, I'm an organist, - What do you want? - Sorry.. - Do you know the combination? - No.. The code word for it is just this, it's Jane. So many secrets Peter and I shared together. - He's only afraid.. - Afraid of what? - And there it is.. - What is it? This is a book that Inspector Rouper would like to find. - A notebook. - A notebook? I didn't know about this. Neither did I, it's a diary he kept. You'd think Peter wouldn't be so careless. That indicates 240 hundred dollar bills, United States currency. All very well made, and posted to Baltimore. It's awful.. And here, 700,000 on the Swiss National Bank, excellent plate, only two mis-prints - and so forth, and so forth, and so forth.. - Then, it is true I'm sure I better put this with the old clothes, which I'm sure you will give me without delay, Mrs Clifton. Whom can you trust? You must trust someone now. At the moment, I don't feel on duty, a private individual, hmm? - Wait right here. - Yes. - Here are the old clothes. - Yes. Inspector Rouper from Scotland Yard. Sorry Mrs Clifton, I have to discharge an unpleasant duty. Unless the Chief Inspector has already completed it. No, this is a social call, do your duty my friend. My dear Rouper, I have to carry my own laundry to be cleaned, a bachelor you know. - Goodbye Mrs Clifton. - Goodbye Mr Burke. Here's a search warrant, now show me to your husbands room, if you please. Follow me. Hello Mary, is my wife at home? Yes, I want to speak to her. Yes Jane, not encouraging I'm afraid. The professors opinion is that my illness can strike again. The professor is guessing, I don't believe it! Oh, by the way, your lawyer Mr Radlowe was here, he wants you to call I have no idea what he wants, except it's important. It's now nearly six, I'll leave here by seven, I hope to see you by 9 o'clock I can't wait... Goodbye.. Excuse me professor, - I must ring up my solicitor. - Of course. - What I wanted to say... - A moment, after he makes his call. Hello, Mr Radlowe, this is Peter Clifton, you said to call. A telegram I sent to your London address is waiting for you. - Things are not going well. - What shall we do? I shouldn't continue to try to keep things quiet? Very well then... In any case, I'll go to London. Yes, when you're ready, let me know. Goodbye. - Important? - Maybe. Radlowe wants me to make a voluntary statement. On what? I'm not really sure, it has to do with the testament of my father though. Testament of your father? Yes, Radlowe wants me to do it quickly. Don't be upset my dear, Mr Hale was no loss, a miserable tramp. However, Peter worries me a little - I feel responsible for you marrying him. - You don't need to feel that way. Well of course you know I was a bit upset, worried.. My illness, I would have enjoyed travelling south with you. No longer to be a postcard Picasso, to give it all up. Oh, don't say that Uncle John.. Your pictures have always been wonderful to me. It's not important. The important thing is you and Peter Fortunately, you don't love him. Well, isn't that so? Now listen Uncle John, I've been getting to know peter very well. He's my husband, and I'll stand by him. You mean you're in love? Tell me, are you? - Yes.. - Why, that's wonderful. Well it's wonderful, if it wasn't for this trouble. - Now if Peter wasn't.. Wasn't completely... - You mean he's insane? No, please don't mention it again. Oh by the way, here's that plate that was lost. Oh, where was it? - In Longford Castle. - What did you say, Longford Castle? Yes, somehow it seems to have slipped into Peter's luggage. You see.. I said I gave all the printing plates back to Peter. But a thought occurs to me that's frightening I've been told by Wells, that at Longford Castle a secret room was discovered and considering that Peter is such an expert engraver, well... What do you mean? That Peter really is a schizophrenic, leading a double life Peter in this life with you, and Peter the shrewd and ruthless forger.. Oh Uncle, stop it.. It's just too absurd I am sorry my darling, I don't want you to be hurt. But we must except the conclusions that exist. Do you hear me? Answer me Peter Clifton alias Blonberg. It was my son you killed, your brother! You murderer! You brutal murderer! I'll kill you, I'll get revenge. - Hello, excuse her please. - Who is this? It's the Doctor, she's sick. - Hello.. - Don't let it worry you my dear. Mrs Anderson is insane, she made it very clear at the wedding party. Who isn't mad now? Even I might be. She thinks Peter is the one who killed Basil her son. - Basil Hale was her son? - Yes, it's all so confusing Uncle. My leather coat please. - Tell me, what do you know of Blonberg? - He's a broker, that's all I know. You know he's the manager of Longford Castle - Yes, but is he involved? I'm convinced that Blonberg has a lot of answers for us and I'm going to see him in person. Oh yes, my name is Blonberg, I'm honoured by your visit Mrs Clifton. You manage Longford Castle, I want the name of the owner. Be seated here, please. The owner of Longford Castle is an old fellow who lives in Florence, he's never been seen here at all. It seems strange doesn't it. - We transmit his money to his Paris bank. - And his name, please tell me that I know it sure, but I cannot just give it out, you see miss. If the gentleman said not to. Another question, do you know a Mrs Anderson? No, this name I've never heard, oh, but to be sure I'll ask my employees if they know the name. No, you don't have to, - you personally do not know her? - No. - Then excuse all the questions. - It was no trouble. - May I show you... - Thank you, I know the way. Very well then.. Good day.. - Hello Mrs Clifton. - Oh good day Chief Inspector Burke. - Did you buy any real estate? - You were watching me? If you'll allow me, I'll keep a bit of an eye on you. Oh, and the man who owns Longford castle is Branes. You know you should have asked me, for his name I'll take you home, come along. Oh, I have to tell you something that might be unpleasant Mrs Clifton. About Peter? That depends, it's about the clothing you gave me for the poor people I found myself in the middle of Westminster Bridge, when I felt like a cigarette suddenly. - Would you like one? - Thank you. - Does Peter smoke these too? - Not these.. So, I put the parcel down on the railing of the bridge, and then, I must have leaned against it, or something, and then it dropped into the water, sank like a stone, I imagine it was the tools that made it sink I just can't figure you out Mr Burke.. You're more puzzling all the time I'm just doing my job. - Are you Mr Clifton? - No, Mrs Clifton is here. - A telegram. - Hello, Mrs Clifton. - Yes? - A telegram for you. - From Peter? - No, for Peter. I would still open it up. Allow me please.. Come to Sydenham, document 21 ready at 3 Go to the police tomorrow. - Signed Radlowe. - I guess Peter didn't call Radlowe. Document goes to the police.. A bit strange... It's well past 8, shouldn't Peter be here now? I don't understand it, I better ring up Longford Castle. Longford Castle... No Mrs Clifton, your husband isn't here now, he left. - Yes, I'd say it's been 2 hours. - Thank you Anna I don't understand, Peter left 2 hours ago I don't like it much either.. - I'm off to Sydenham to see that lawyer. - I'll go too.. - No no, if you stay here it'll be better. - Why must I, any reason? Alright, if you wish.. It's very dark around here, do you know the house sir? There's Peter's car, it's right there. How come his car is here? The smell of this is foul, please see if the key is in it, and wait right here. - Yes, the key is there.. - I'm not surprised.. But what does all this mean? - Can you drive it? - Yes I can, but.. It's good we're here, we'll drive around the corner, we have to be careful. Yes but I... You wait there, and don't get scared when I come back. Open the car door, quick! - Peter my dear, what happened, is he...? - He's unconscious, but not hurt. Drive home at once, be sure you're not seen bringing him in. - And listen, Peter was not here at all. - Yes. Are you Mr Clifton? Mr Radlowe is waiting for you. This way please, Mr Clif... Call the nearest police station. Have them send the homicide squad immediately. What are you waiting for? All his notes are missing, he had just started on the seventh page. If we knew what was on the last pages, we would know the murderer of Radlowe and Hale. - Rouper, you're alert today.. - Think so, eh? The housemaid has told us, Radlowe had expected Mr Clifton to come. - Think he was here? - Not him Rouper. Mr Clifton sent me instead, you see. These footprints are still wet I protest! This is a scandalous treatment for a good taxpayer. - Indeed, I protest. - We found this man loitering about. Hey watch it, what are you doing? Look out there! Be careful! Who are you? My name is Stone, I'm a neighbour you see, I'm right next door. - You live next door? - Yes sir. - About an hour ago, did you see something? - Yes, yes I did. About an hour ago, I was walking peacefully with Socrates, that's my dog you see and I'm sure I saw a man go to the rear entrance here. - You saw him? - Was he tall or short? - Rather tall. - Was he relaxed or in a rush? Erect or bent? Did he walk erect or not? He was erect, and in a rush I rather expected that kind of description. Can I go now? May I go sir? May I please leave now? May I go? - Something there? - May I go now. This? Nothing important. He's asleep.. He was conscious briefly, he got out of the car, came in the house. Then he didn't remember a thing. Now I want to know Mr Burke, - at the house in Sydenham, what happened? - Mr Radlowe, was murdered. - Oh god.. That means that he.. - Please don't ask any further questions. Interesting, lots of cash I removed the hand written confession that was in his left shoe. Do the servants know Peter's here? Yes, but I told them he's here a long while. Everything is turning out for the best. And that brings me now, to a fantastic performance I believe I will consult a doctor now. A doctor? - Yes, a psychiatrist, a pretty clever one.. That is, one who believes in his own shrewdness. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh you, Mr Burke.. Sorry to disturb you so late, but I must see your husband. Yes, please come in Scotland Yard, in the middle of the night? Yes, I'm playing a theatrical detective, doctor I've been wanting to act like a television private eye, but I hardly get the chance. Sorry, I've been working rather late My head aches awfully I have the feeling doctor, that tomorrow, there will be a headache epidemic. Yes, that poor Peter Clifton, and Mrs Clifton, and Inspector Rouper, - and you too, doctor. - I hope not. You better clear that up, come in. This'll be man to man my dear. Ah, modern art.. Here's where you treat your victims? You have a special sense of humour May I get you a drink, whiskey? No thank you.. I believe there's an admirable quotation on the subject from Kipling, no? - Accept the first drink, or something.. - Fine... Who are you after, and for what? I haven't decided, I haven't selected the quarry. But I'll soon pick on someone. You must have heard that, - an old lawyer was murdered. - Radlowe murdered? I mentioned Radlowe then? I merely said that an old lawyer was killed, why Radlowe? Well, I.. I know that he's Peter's lawyer. Yes, I heard them talking on the phone, yesterday Peter was to go and meet him. Yes Doctor, Radlowe is the lawyer who was murdered. Stabbed by someone unknown. The murderer was seen by a neighbour, who gave us a complete description. A neighbour saw him you say? Yes that's right A bit of luck eh? You might say I came, to avoid the possibilities of stories that would put. - Peter near Radlowe's office last night. - Yes Radlowe, it's awful. When and where did Peter leave you? I would say we both left about 7 or so. - He went to Radlowe. - And you think, he's the murderer? No, you mustn't have heard that I've said that, don't believe it! That is, now that you say it, I'm not so sure... Don't worry doctor, when we find the stiletto, we'll have an easy time finding the murderer. You see, as a rule, the classic murderer, doesn't leave evidence at the scene, unless he uses it to throw suspicion on another. Sometimes a cigarette case is left too, so idiots like me will think the man who owns it is a murderer. Yes, I have no idea what I can do for you. Well... You know Peter had been doped, you prefer to use morphine in these cases? - Are you accusing me of drugging Peter? - I haven't mentioned that I mean that you've been acting not as Peter's friend, but for yourself. So, I think only of myself? So what if I told you Peter confessed Hale's murder to me? What would you do? - I would arrest you on the spot.. - Me? And if I might add, what charge? Among other things, I would charge you with using a false banknote deliberately. Oh but, that note was Peter's I would further accuse you of violating your oath as a doctor. Chief Inspector, you don't know what you're saying I do Mr Wells.. I know what I say.. And I warn you, leave Peter Clifton alone. If you plan to rob him of his millions, just forget it. You were in Longford Castle when Basil Hale was murdered. - And you... - I was in Longford Castle, yes, but I haven't left my house since! Admitted.. But before that, where were you? Where were you between Longford Castle and your home? You're beaten Wells... even cigarettes that Peter doesn't use, and false notebooks by the forger, won't be enough for you. Somebody will pay for the murders, you can be sure of that, but not Peter Clifton. Goodnight. - Where am I? - At home. At home... Can you imagine how interesting it is, to have a husband who can't remember what bed he's sleeping in? - It seems quite difficult to be my wife. - But it grows on you Jane... Don't underestimate Burke, he collects evidence 'till he's sure. Then he strikes suddenly, like an explosion. At Scotland Yard he's known as the bomb. If he's protecting Peter Clifton then, I'm sure the murderers name is in his hands. It makes me nervous doctor. Oh don't act like a child, Rouper, why are so worried? To the best of your knowledge you did your duty. What do you mean? I simply did what ever you told me should be done. You told me Clifton murdered Hale, and more.. That you saw him in bed, all covered with blood, and his bloody clothes were in his London home and there I would easily find them. And furthermore, you announced, that in his safe I would find a very interesting notebook. But nothing seems to be true at all. Why don't you tell Scotland Yard that Clifton is an assassin? I can still do it. What's that you say? Mrs Anderson thinks Peter Clifton, the forger and Mr Blonberg. Are one and the same person? Yes, it's a fixed idea with her. In her closet, she has a loaded revolver hidden away Leith, ah, doctor Donald Wells Well what happened? Yes, I spoke to Jane but. But it won't be as easy to carry out the big plan, as we figured. Yes, oh sure good, suppose that you can, bring Peter around to commit himself, and turn his money over to Jane to manage it. What then? We must let Jane into the plan, naturally. But she won't play along. Something has happened that we didn't think, would happen. You see Peter's her husband. Of course you can try that, but don't get confident. Your appeal to the ladies is overrated Wells Anderson wants to avenge her son, by shooting Peter Clifton dead. Shall I take the revolver away? Let the Chief decide... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - How's Peter? - Asleep.. So, I must say, I'm glad I can see you alone - Please... It was an awful thing last night. - You mean Radlowe? - I mean Radlowe.. Then you believe that, Peter is involved? Listen Jane... The fact is, that now it's essential that Peter, for himself, and in your interests too, have to face the truth. He will always have his trouble mentally I'm afraid that the truth about these murders will come out some day that would lead to a terrible public trial Truly it would be a scandal. You would suffer for it too So I think that it's for the best that Peter does something to avoid it. What do you suggest? Jane, first both Peter and you, must believe, I have just your best interests at heart. - And then? - Yes then, Peter must get an incompetence hearing, so that he will be declared insane and confined. It's not really so shocking.. He'll be confined for maybe a total of 5 maybe 6 years. In other words, Peter should declare himself insane. Just a formality, and we'll do it quietly. It's the only way. Jane.. You understand that under the law you would manage his fortune, and if you wish you can decide to call on your uncle, or... or me.. As trustee, as you wish, you must not ignore this Jane.. Your own social standing in London. As the wife of a sentenced murderer, you would be an outcast... So you say it's an absolute fact, that Peter is mentally ill? Yes, all the symptoms speak for it. It's evident when he talks, he's constantly blinking. His entire behaviour.. These symptoms, would any specialist recognise them? Yes of course. For example, Sir George Galthom or Dr Heinrich Strauss? Naturally.. Such great doctors are very busy people. And also the great neuro psychiatrist, Sir Frederick Jackson? Yes, without doubt. But Jane, we can't afford to let too many others in on the murders that are involved I've been playing a little game Dr Wells. The 3 doctors that I've been talking about, came today for tea and they have tested Peter, and talked with him, and each of these 3 doctors assured me that Peter is just as sane as anyone can be. But, but it doesn't make sense. They're all mistaken obviously, - since Professor Cloors... - Is a charlatan that you brought in to help put Peter in an institution. I'm on to your tricks Dr Wells I don't understand.. Now I would appreciate it if you would get out of here. Dr Wells wants to leave.. I'll go of course, if that's what you want. But I hope Jane, you won't be sorry later on I won't be too sorry. What's that? Liverpool versus Glasgow, the game is still nil nil. The plates complete the case... We can arrest, Peter Clifton as the forger. That's excellent, why that's great. We just arrest the fellow, and tomorrow I watch the kings cup game. The police searching Longford Castle found the missing press, and the plates, in the pond, right behind the park. The report is completely written up. Yes, I hope you didn't forget to mention that in Longford castle, a tremendous amount of forged money was made. Thank you, I put it down already. The 20 five pound notes, you picked up last Sunday from Dr Wells were probably genuine, or the bank wouldn't have accepted them - I have no idea what you mean. - I'll be glad to explain. You're under arrest Rouper! You can't do this! Let me go. One... nil. So Burke is after you, are you surprised about that? My orders were to fake Hale's death and you had no order from me to kill Radlowe. You know I hate violence, look at the Consequences. What has been done, can not be changed - I must get away, and right now too. - I'm not keeping you - I need cash. - You're a rich man. But an hour ago, my wife took everything and left I need your help... And what about your fine plan with Clifton? Listen Blonberg... Let me down now, and I will not go down alone, understand? I didn't say I wouldn't help you, how much do you need? Five thousand pounds? Very well, come here at about 11 pm Someone will be waiting. Can't I come sooner? No, you will be here at eleven, someone will be here to meet you with the money. You must tell that person that you are Blonberg, is that clear? Good, I'll do whatever you want. - Now, you know what to do Henry? - I do Sir. And tell the distributers they will get new merchandise in 8 days - 100 Deutsche Mark notes. - I will Sir. This is Blonberg, tell Mrs Anderson I want to speak to her here at 11 pm. - Glad you're feeling better Peter. - Thank you Burke. - Doesn't he look well? - Indeed he does I want you to hear this, It was saved by Radlowe. On top it says without name change, the text. Mrs Alexander Wellerson, that was your mother was married to a man who by chance, was her first husbands cousin. Mrs and Mr Wellerson, that's your stepfather... accompanied by their seven month old child, who was of the first marriage, that's you Peter. Took a Riviera trip.. Yes, but that means that... That the Wellerson who murdered 2 people and finally ended up in Dartmoor to die, - was not your father at all.. - But only your stepfather, who married Anderson later, without benefit of divorcing his wife, your real mother. Now then, the forger.. Who is he? - You know him? - I know him. You know where he could be hiding? I know at least, where that so called, Blonberg works where he'll meet contacts, even tonight. That is all, I must go now. Blonberg 1, Blonberg 1. Do you hear me? He went in just now, be sure you're ready.. Are you there Blonberg? Have you brought the cash? Let's have it, quick. Money, you want money? After you murdered your brother in cold blood Peter Clifton. Murderer! You dirty bloody murderer Blonberg or Clifton. You're crazy, I'm not Clifton! Murderer! All is clear.. - And if he doesn't come, what then? - He's coming, no doubt at all. Halt! It's too late, Peter Clifton Peter! Peter! What have you done Peter? Nothing, nothing at all. He wanted to do something, but he didn't succeed. - The lift signal, he's coming! - Lights out! - Don't make a foolish move! - Uncle John! Mr Leith, or Mr Blonberg, or the forger... It's unfortunate Peter I'm aware that you tried to warn Leith so that Jane might not have been hurt Marjorie told me where to find Uncle John. - Peter, you knew? - Yes Jane. That time at Longford Castle when I found the forgery hidden away and the plate that I'd loaned a while ago to Uncle John he pretended was lost. What's going on? Excuse me please, it was a goal for our side. Well I'm cheering for our team too. Oh Chief Inspector. Tell me, how did that case come out then? The best my friend, the best
