Why is Lakhanpur's file empty? There is no statement, no report? Sir, not even a single report came from that village.. Till today. Whichever officer is posted in that village.. Never returns from there. All the other villages have developed to some extent.. With government's helps, but that village is still in the dark. There are a lot of problems in that village. The villagers are in pathetic condition. Who is the president of that village? Thakur Vijay Singh. Long live... Thakur Vijay Singh. Calm down, brothers. Calm down. There is no need to praise me like that.. Because I am also an ordinary person like you. I know that there are a lot of problems in your lives. And to relieve you of those problems.. I have arranged a help for your from the bank. Claps. I request Mr. Gautam Sharma who is with us to proceed. I request Mr. Thakur to distribute this money.. With his own hands among you people. No. No. No. This money belongs to the villagers. And I don't want to come between.. The villagers and the bank. I want you to do this holy deed. Brothers, please come accept his gift. Let's go, Gokul. After receiving the money Mr. Thakur wants all of you.. To come to his bungalow for a reception. All of you must come. Print the thumb. 0k, brother. So brothers, everyone got the money? Yes. Then all of you submit the money. Submit? - Ya. - But why, Mr. Accountant? It's Mr. Thakur's order that he got you the money.. And he himself will buy you the cows. But Mr. Accountant, you must buy good cows for us. Leave that to us and give the money. Fast. What are you thinking about, uncle Sunder? Mr. Sardarilal, I will buy the cow myself. Is your cow special then the rest of the villagers? Are you giving the money or not? No. No? He's dead. No? Hey, you, aren't you ashamed of beating an elder? If you have guts, then fight with me. If I don't make you kiss the dust, I'll change my name. You ugly dogs. Bijli, whom are you calling dogs.. - I'm a puppy. - Shut up! If you bark again I will break you head, Kaniye(Blind man). Kaniye? What's going on? What are you fighting about? Sunder isn't submitting the money.. And Biin is supporting him. Then what's there to fight? It's their money. It's their wish if they want to.. Submit the money or not. Who are you to force them? Have they beaten you? I am really sorry.. That they behaved like this with you. You may go. Let's go, father. I couldn't understand this. They who revolt against you.. Are bashed up. Mr. Thakur, you let them go just like that? [You fools, Bi] 5 the most beautiful girl of this village. And I have a thing for her since along time. And you know it very well that the girl whom is like.. You shouldn't have fought in Thakur's house. Father, what are you saying! If I hadn't done that, they would have taken our money. That's right, but why do you forget that you aren't a boy.. But you are a girl? Father, what's so special in boys.. That I don't have? I too know how to answer people. You shouldn't speak like that, girl. This kind of things doesn't suit girls. I brought you up with so much love. Now I pray to God day and night.. To give me strength to get you married soon. Oh father! How many times will I have to tell you.. That I don't want to get married? Come. You might be hungry. Have dinner! Gopi. Gopi. You are hungry, right? Eat this. Don't get scared. You haven't eaten anything since morning. How will you work with empty stomach? Eat something. Take it. How is he related to you that you brought food for him.. By deceiving me? Why don't you answer? I said why you brought the food. He works day and night like a manic and there is no one.. Who offers him even a glass of water. That's my duty to look after those things, but not yours. We should keep such kind of scoundrel hungry. Only then they work. They get too smart when they get stomach-full food. A horse's place is in the stable, but not in the house. - But.. - Shut up! Are you trying to argue with me? Don't forget that you are my late friend's daughter.. And I am your guardian now. Behave yourself. If you try to show any mercy towards him again.. Then you will have to face me. Did you get me? Wow, uncle Sunder! So you bought the cows? Yes, brother. See how it is. It's really good. Now look at our condition, uncle Sunder. They took our money and now we didn't even get a calf. They are saying everyday that they will give the cows.. But they didn't give it till now. It's your courage, uncle, that you didn't listen to him. No, it's not my courage. It's because of Biin that.. "The youthfulness is here." "my scarf.." "The youthfulness is here." "My scarf is flying away.." "I hold it here, it falls from there..." "I hold it here, it falls from there..." "It sways like a serpent.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." "I hold it here, it falls from there..." "It sways like a serpent.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." "The band will played.." "The henna will be applied.." "The band will played.." "The henna will be applied.." "The friends will dance.." "The palanquin will be decked up.." "The band will played, henna will be applied.." "The friends will dance, the palanquin will be decked up.." "Thinking of what will happen after that.." "My heart shudders.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." "I hold it here, it falls from there..." "It sways like a serpent.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." "Silver bangle, golden ear ring.." "Silver bangle, golden ear ring.." "Printed scarf from Jaipur.." "Silver bangle, golden ear ring.." "Printed scarf from Jaipur.." "Sometimes, the mischievous one, bangs into the clouds.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." "I hold it here, it falls from there..." "It sways like a serpent.." "The youthfulness is here..." "My scarf is falling from my head.." Hello, mister. Why are you in the middle of the path? This is not your city, but this is a village. That too Bijll 5 Village. - Bull? - Ya, Bull, It's my name. It's a great name. Stop talking rubbish.. And remove your vehicle from my path. I am getting late. My vehicle is in trouble and I am new to this place. Where do you have to go? Lakhanpur. - Lakhanpur? - Yes. Then you are going to my village. Come, I will drop you. Really. Moti, take care of the vehicle. I will be back. - What's your name? - Ram. Sorry. Sorry. It seems that Lakhanpur will be very beautiful? How come? When you are so beautiful.. Then the village will also be beautiful naturally. Sorry. There are so many potholes. Where are going? To Thakur Vijay Singh's house. To Thakur Vijay Singh's house. - Got down. Got down. - But. You Thakur's goon! She is really a Biin (current). Come here. You think that this is your father's? Hey, Tingu, take this. Don't stare at me. Move forward. Mr. Accountant, give me.. A little bit more, I am very hungry. You won't get more. Please give me, Mr. Accountant. I'm really hungry. Mr. Accountant, he is really hungry. Give me a bit more. Master, you just keep quiet. Don't argue with me. You won't get more. Get lost. Please give me a bit more. You give us half-glass milk, that too mixed with water. Do you sell the rest of the milk and spend the money? Who are you to ask me? You have a very big mouth. You won't listen to me this way. You are getting smart with me? Getting smart with me? Get lost. Hey, move forward. Get lost. Get lost. Take it. Who are you? What are you doing? It's not his father's property. What's going on? This is government's milk. We have to answer them. Why have you lifted me? Is that kid your father or you are his father? First of all you mix water In government's milk.. And then you slap the kid? Hey, Randheer.. "Sham, Phikna, Sadhu, where are you?" Are you okay? He is a big goon. He broke my bones in just one heave. You are washing them up. Are you washerman or what? You are also gone? Now he is coming towards me. He will glue me to the wall like a film-poster. I shall run now. Sir, he is the new officer. Shut up! Shut up, you scoundrel. You drink at daytime. You are really a manner less person. Don't you know.. That before sitting you must take the officer's permission? And you might be forgetting that before coming to.. This village one must take our permission. I came to tell.. I know it very well what you want to say. You just listen to me carefully.. You made this village a hell. It'd be better if you mend your way before I mend your ways. My name is Ram. You did a great job, sir, by teaching them a lesson. I thought that you are Thakur's man. That's why I got you off the cart that day. I did a big mistake. Forgive me please. It seems that you are still angry. You neither answer me nor you look at me with love. It doesn't matter anyway, but let me tell you one this, sir.. Jhakur and his men are not good. Gap“.! Come. Gopi, he is Mr. Ram, our village's new officer. He came to look after our village. Greetings. He can't speak. He is a very hard-working person.. But Thakur doesn't give him what he deserves. Don't get scared. It is the temple's snake-god. It doesn't bit anybody. She is Sharda. She comes to the temple everyday.. To feed milk to the snake-god. He is Ram. The new officer in this village. Greetings. Greetings. Ram, Thakur has done grave injustice to her too. Her father was Thakur's friend. So while dying he gave his daughter to him. But that wretch grabbed all her property. And look at God's justice. He made this Goddess-like woman a widow at a young age. So you want to say that the new officer is very arrogant.. And that he has misbehaved with you. Even our shoes hurt us when they are new. Don't trouble yourself with such a small thing. Don't worry. I will bring that officer in control very soon. But what's surprising is that he came here just now.. “And h. Hm uni-“Mm awn: M. - an“. Sir, it's Bi I who spends all the time with him. I think she did all this. No. No. No. 313“ can never do that. 313“ is a very nice gm. She is my life. - Banwari. - Sir. Uncle Sunder! Uncle Sunder, are you at home? Father is not at home. So what? Where are you going? What if father isn't there at home? You are here. I came here to talk to you. Talk to me? What do you want to talk to me about? Bijll, It's very beneficial thing. Let me sit here first, then I will tell you what it is. You sat without my permission. [What can I do, Bi] I? No one in the village respects me.. That's why I have to take it. What else can I do? Ok. Ok. Tell me what the matter is. [The matter is that, Bi]ll.. Do you look at your beautiful face in this mirror? In this mirror? Awe! You should have a mirror with golden stand.. The princesses have. Enough. Enough. Don't praise me now. I am not praising you, Biin. This is an absolute truth. Even the great poet Kalidas can't praise your beauty. You don't know what you are. Accountant, you are praising me a bit more than required. It's more too much. What else will we say about a moon? To be honest, you are a fairy, but what's the use... In spite of having all these are in an ugly hut. Are you born to live in a hut? Then where else have I born to live? In Thakur's bungalow, where you will get everything.. That you don't have right now. Diamonds! Every material comfort! Mr. Thakur is ready to do whatever you will say. Really? He cares that much about me? Even more than that. That's the reason Mr. Thakur.. Gave this hut to you to live. So listen to me and say yes. Today the day is also an auspicious day. Come with me. Mr. Thakur will be very to see you. Ok, since you saying this I will come. But let me get ready first. Ok, get ready. Wow, Mr. Banwari Lal, you will make a lot of wealth.. Because of Biin. The job is done. [Bi] I, come fast. Aren't you ready yet? Yes, Mr. Accountant, I am getting ready. Scoundrel! Rouge! Dog! What are you doing! You want me to go to the Thakur? The milk spilled. I am just.. What are you doing! Scoundrel! I won't leave you. Scoundrel! 0 God! 0 God! Save me! Save my father! Save my family! I wonder whose face I saw in the morning. But what happened? Sir, ask what hasn't happened. Shoes! Sandals! Sweeper! Utensils! She has beaten me with whatever she got. And made the map of Africa on my face. Did you tell my name? Your name? Sir, had I taken your name, she would have come here... and made the same condition of yours that she made mine. I lied to her that you are not in the town. I told that you went on pilgrimage to Kasi. How dare is she! Make them homeless. Mr. Banwari Lal, have mercy on us. Please don't do this to us. Don't make us homeless. Do you think that this is your father's place? Throw this scoundrel out of here. Hey, your father might be a scoundrel. Don't dare to touch my father. What are you string at? One eye is already closed.. Now I will close the other one. How dare are you to raise your hand on Banwari! If you have guts then touch me, rascal. [Bi] I, today I'm not alone. Your sweeper won't work today. Today Sardari is there with me. Master, punish this girl.. So hard that she will weep for the rest of her life. Get lost. Who has the touch me? Really? So you aren't afraid of anyone? Leave me, rascal. Who's that? You don't recognize your daddy? It's you? You don't enter between us, Mr. Inspector. This is a matter between us. So it's you? Use the stick or else I will deduct you salary. It seems that the kid has a lot of spirit of youth. Not of youth, but that of humanity. But this is not your city, it's our village. And here only what we want will happen on this place. "Whenever the sins increases on the earth" every time someone takes births to terminate it. - Let's go. - Stop. If you want to be alive, then never do such kind of a thing. - Did you get me? - Ok. Ok. But officer, you will regret our enmity. And get one more thing clearly. Till I am here what I want will happen here. Go. Let's go. Let's go. Thanks a lot, sir. You saved us from being homeless. What are you doing, Baba? You are like my father. And whatever I did was my duty. Thank you, sir. You are not a human, but you are God. You will get the blessing of the poor. Moti, what are you doing here? What's the matter? Where are you dragging me to? What' 5 the matter, Mott? My God! He has a high temperature. You are here? Your dear Moti brought me here. You have high temperature. Let me massage your head. You shouldn't have come here. If anyone sees you, you will get humiliated. I am not afraid of humiliation. You lay down. When you will sleep I will go. I haven't seen anything. Shut up! You interfere in everything. Why are you scolding that poor boy? He is not know him. And don't call him poor boy. He is very naughty. Now since he is here... he'll take care of me. It's too late. Go to your home please. Moti, leave her at her house. Thank you. You found a rose in this village before me. You are really great, Moti. Good boy. Uncle Ram, shop. Uncle Ram. Shop. What's the matter, son? It's very important matter. Drop me at school, I will tell you. I will drop you anyway. What's the matter? Nothing. Sister Biin told me.. That if I see brother Ram, then I shall ask him.. To meet in the park behind the mountain at 40' clock. Really? Yes. She talks about you all the day. Sister 313“, sister 313“, stop. I won't stop. You are very naughty. I brought a message for you. You will be very happy if you hear it. Whose message is it? It's Mr. Ram's. Mr. Ram's? Tell me what the message is. I will tell you if you let me sit on the cart. Naughty boy! Come, sit. Now tell me what's the message? Mr. Ram was said.. What did he say? I won't tell you, you always get angry at me. Ok, dear, from now onwards I will not get angry at you. Now tell me what it is. First promise me that.. You will drop me at my home everyday. Ok, I'll drop.. You at your home everyday. Now tell me what it is. Mr. Ram said that you are very nice. Really? And told me.. To ask you to meet him in park at evening at 40' clock. Mot' Where are you taking me to?

You called me. - You called me. - You called me. - It's you.. - You called me. - You.. - You.. "0 my beloved one, what's the difference.." "if I called you or you called me." "Love has called both of us." "You came here." "And I too came here." "I came here..." "I came here..." "I flew my scarf and the breeze started flowing." "I flew my scarf and the breeze started flowing." "I applied kohl on my eyes and the clouds summoned." "When you set free you hair, the night falls." "What shouldn't happen happens in the night."

I lied to Mr. Ram because I wanted to go to school.. On his jeep and I lied to you because I wanted to.. Come home on your cart. Please forgive me. I will never lie again. Lying is a bad habit, but your lie was a sweet one. - Really, sister? - Yes. - Greetings, Mr. Ram. - Greetings. Greetings, Mr. Ram. Greetings. Greetings. Sir, we looking for you. What's the matter, Shyam Lal? We are in big trouble, sir. Thakur took away our money and also not giving our cows.. And now he is threatening us. It's really strange. Why is everyone in the village so scared of Thakur? Sir, when the sun in above us, we have the shadows. Since you came here our hopes from your raised. - Hopes from me? - Yes, sir. You are the one who ploughs the earth and harvest. You have the strength to lift even the heaviest things. But you don't have the strength.. To demand for your rights? You took credit from the bank.. And he is enjoying your money? None of you have the guts to say anything to Thakur? He who says anything is make mum forever. Really? Come with me. Come. Take away your cows. Hey, where are you taking the cows? - Thank you. - Don't thank me. Why are you taking away the cows? Mr. Accountant. Mr. Accountant. Hey, Accountant. They are taking away my cows.. And you are irritating me? Get lost. Where are you taking away my cows? Master. Master. Master, there's a disaster. Why are you shouting? You are blasting my eardrums. I know what you are about to say, that that officer has.. Distributed our cattle among the villagers, right? Yes. Don't worry. I have a remedy for that. It's 9 and this officer didn't come here till now. Have you invited him or not? Yes, I invited him. If he doesn't respect the time, he should at least respect me. Sir, here he is. Welcome, Mr. Ram. It's great to meet you. Please come, sit down. No, thanks. I just didn't understand why you invited me. If you didn't understand it, then you will get it in a moment. First of all tell me what you will take. Whiskey? Rum? Gin? Brandy? Thank you, but I don't drink. If you don't drink, then start it from today. If we drink together, then our friendship develops further. When was I your enemy in the first place? You started enmity the moment you came, Mr. Ram.. But I was silent, because I want friendship. And for that friendship's sake... please accept a small gift from me. Please take it. No, No. Don't think that it's a bribe. This is a small token of friendship. That's not a gift, but that's handcuff. Handcuff? When you know everything, then why are you rejecting.. My friendship. I know your friendship, Thakur. On these notes there is the blood of.. Those innocent people whom you caned. People don't die here their natural deaths. Only they die whom you don't want to be alive. Thakur, you still have time. Mend your ways. Or else it will be too late. Just like a sharp sword cannot cut its holder.. The biggest officer of this area cannot even touch me. This is my village. And it runs as I want. I want you to live in this village as my man. You will be happy. I came to this village on.. Government's behalf to develop it. And I will definitely complete my duty. Goodnight. Baba, what happened? Baba, why do you lift such heavy things at this age? We have to do anything to feed ourselves. Then why do you lift these? The government gave you.. Farms. Why don't you do irrigation? Government has definitely given us.. But there are people didn't let us get that. Who is that? We will tell you, Mr. Ram. We will tell you. Thakur has forced them to make sign some papers.. And taken their farms. What can they do now? How dare you to enter my bungalow.. Without my permission? Death doesn't takes anyone's permission, Mr. Thakur. And I came here as your death. Officer, you've the illusion that you came here as an.. Incarnation of God to remove atrocities from this village. We don't need an incarnation for God to kill some insects. Stop talking rubbish! This village isn't big enough where I.. As well as my enemy can live together. Thakur. You have enjoyed the farms of the poor villagers.. For many days, but now your days are over. Your days are over, you foolish kid. Even the kids can hold a gun.. But it's not kids' play to operate it. Officer. Shut up! The villagers don't have water to drink.. And you bathe in wine. They don't have a roti to eat.. And you offer lavish parties. Government has given them farms.. And you have snatched them and kept in your locker. Give me the keys. Give me the keys! Never ever dare to threaten the villagers.. And make them sign on stamp papers. Did you get me? Take this. Sir, this officer is becoming dangerous by the day. He dares to come to the mansion! If I don't get this bastard officer's hands and legs cut off.. My name is not Thakur Vijay Singh. Mr. Shyam Lal, give these papers to them. - Long live... - Mr. Ram. What happened, Gopi? Why are you so scared? You don't get scared. Nothing will happen to me. But I don't understand why you are so bothered about me. I am God? Come inside with me. Come, Moti. I will make you a gentleman today. Come, Moti. Come on, my handsome boy. Good boy. Very good. Very good. Wow! You are looking like a gentleman. Moti, take Gopi outside. Good boy! This is called video-camera. We can take see the picture taken by this anytime we want. Ok? Sit down. They look very good. Who gave that to you? I got it. Mr. Ram gave that to you, didn't he? Really, he is the God for the poor. Hi, was there any letter, Moti? Thank you. That's a good boy. There is a call from head office. I've to go there urgently. Moti, please bring my briefcase. How come the moon is here at this time? 1 made Hahn for you. 1 came here to give it to you. I will definitely eat the Halva, but if you come out.. Looking so beautiful, then men may get greedy. Who has the guts even to look at me? You are right. It's very tasty. It's not good? I mean it's sweet. Thanks, Moti. Are you going somewhere? Thank God you came here or else I would have to come.. To your home to tell you that I am going to city. What! You are leaving the village? You fool! How can I leave the village when you are here? It's not in my hands. It's related to my job, I've to go. "Do you have to go today? Tomorrow it's my birthday" and I will be alone at home. Why? Where's your father? My father also went to city. Don't worry. I am leaving Moti over here. Look, Moti.

Moti, I will.. A dog's tail is always crooked. Let your master come here. I'll complaint to him about you. Did Mr. Ram leave here to look after me or to disturb me? Don't get too smart. Naughty boy! He gave you too much freedom. Come, I will teach you a lesson. Come. Come inside. You are getting too naughty. Now stay in this jail. I am not going to open the door. You are troubling me a lot. Who is troubling you? Moti, Mr. Ram's pet. He always chases me. He doesn't let me do my work. And when I was bathing he took my clothes away. That's why I shut him inside the house. Now Mr. Ram will come set him free. Bark as much as you wish. I am not going to open the door. Mr. Ram is coming today. If I set you free... then you won't let me do my work. You naughty boy! 'For whom are you adorning yourself so much?' 'For Mr. Ram? Will he like you?' Why won't he like me? What's missing in me? "The fire caught in my body and soul."

Get up, dear. See this. 313“ . No, this can't happen. Biin can't die. My child can't die. My child can't die. No. No. My child can't die. Don't shout. Don't shout. My child is sleeping. Let her take rest. Shut up! Haven't you heard me? My child is sleeping. Let her take rest. Let her take rest. You didn't listen to me. I won't leave you alive today. Leave me, Gopi. Leave me. I will kill him. Why are you beating him, brother? You don't know Sharada what I have done for him. It was a matter of just one day. Just one day. I left him to look after Biin. She died and he was sleeping here. No, that's not true. 313“ tied him here. - What? - Y-, Illwltwlfllmyownly-. It's not at all his mistake. "Your favors..'" "Your appreciations.." "Your favors..'"

Alone at this time? Betrayer! My slave has wrong intentions for the ladies of my house? Today I am going to kill you. Rascal. Let him stay here like this till he is dead. Let's go. Gopi. Gopi. Gopi. Don't worry about me, Gopi.. At least your injuries will heal. Don't be scared, Gopi. Eat it. I don't understand why you have so much affection.. For that dumb beggar. I see. Do you want to quench the fire of carnal desires with him? If that's the reason, then why didn't you tell that to me? I would have fulfilled your desire a lot earlier. Stay away from me. You are like my father. But I am not your father. Can't my heart tumble on looking at your seductive body! Leave me. Leave me. I know you trapped me like a bird to get my property. And today aren't you ashamed to speak like that about.. Gopi and I? What's the matter of being ashamed? You lost your husband and I lost my wife. Why shouldn't we.. For God's sake leave me. Have mercy on me. Leave me. Help! Help! Leave me. Help! For God's sake leave me. No! Help! God, what kind of justice is yours? I worshipped you everyday. I came to your door everyday. But I wonder for which birth's sins you are punishing me. You have taken away my parents, I didn't say anything. You made me homeless, still I didn't say anything. But today, when a demon tried to molest me.. You were sitting here idly? I knew it, there is no justice in your house too. But remember one thing, today I will sacrifice my life.. With your own trident. No. No. Sharada, have you gone mad? Leave it. Leave it. Let me die. Let me die. Sharada, you shouldn't lose hope just like that. This is a temple, it's God's house... where people come pray for life, but not for death. Mr. Ram, I'm tired of living this life which is worse than death. Now I don't have the strength to face difficulties alone. Who says that you are alone? Gopi risked his life and saved your life. But for how many days Gopi will save my life? For the rest of your life, if both of you get together. No. No. That can't happen, Mr. Ram. That can't happen. Why can't it happen? Because you are a widow? No. You have to break such and useless rituals of society. Gopi. Gopi, take the sindoor.. And remove the scar of being widow from Sharada head. Take the sindoor. Don't worry, Gopi. I am with you. What did you say! The dumb married Sharada? How dare is he to marry her? It's not his idea, sir, but it's that officer's game. Now there will be a lot of talk in the village. And people will insult you on your face. No. People will felicitate Thakur. Felicitate.. Whoever messes with me will get the same punishment. Brother. For how many days will be like that? I am not feeling well. Please leave me alone. I can understand your condition, brother.. But do you think that you alone are sad? [Bi] death is depressing for me as much as it's for you.. But who can fight the destiny, brother! Brother, come, let's go somewhere outside. You too will feel better. Please come for our sake. Stand up. Both of you stand up. Come closer. Moti, you opened the rope again? Why are you so obsessed with the photos? Now I will tie you so tight that could never open it. Don't feel shy. Brother, you are married to her. Keep your hand with love. Go and bring sister-in-law, I will take your photo. See this, Mr. Inspector. The knife is in the culprit's hands. He killed her. We heard that there was.. A cold war going between them. Now since you have caught him red-handed, arrest him. Hey, what are you doing? Mr. Inspector, he is pretending to be innocent. Arrest him. Arrest him. "Your favors..'"

My daughter is sleeping. She is sleeping, isn't she God? Yes. I have brought this for her. I don't know when she will wake up. When she wakes up, give it to her. Keep it safely. Don't tell anyone. When she wakes up, give it to her. Don't tell. 0 God! I am dead. I am dead. - I am dead. - What's the matter? You are scared as if death is chasing you. Not only me, but it's chasing three of us. What rubbish! It's not rubbish, sir. I am saying the truth. That dumb has escaped the jail. If you come near me I will kill myself. If that dumb comes here, then kill him. Ok, master. - Will you smoke? - Yes. - No one is here. - There's none. Baba, Moti is here. It seems that he is very hungry. Yes, son.. After Mr. Ram's death there is no one to feed him. No, we don't need it. Give that to Moti. It seems that that dumb is hidden somewhere nearby. There's the dog. That means Gopi and Sarada are also.. Some where nearby. If you follow the dog, you'll get them. Come. Take this medicine. You will be fine. Thank you. I won't go with you. You are a murderer. Get lost. Get lost. Ok, I am coming. Where is the patient? Don't worry. I am not a culprit like Thakur. He poisoned your father and e is the one who killed.. You husband to whom you were married at a young age. Yes. He wanted your property and still he wants.. And I want you. That's why I brought you here. Betrayer! How dare you! I have been waiting for this moment since so many years. Finally I got the chance. Help! Help! 0 God! Hey! Hey! Leave me. Leave me. "I will put a flower on your grave..." "and always worship you." "God will always give you peace." "Almighty will always give you blessings."

Mr. Inspector, you are asking that question to us? Why don't you ask that to the dog? We know only one thing, Mr. Inspector that yesterday.. That dumb Gopi escaped from the police custody and.. Today this dog has killed an innocent person mercilessly. My advice is that you should kill mad dog. Don't worry. We will catch that murderer. It's not the murderer, it's the dog. It's the dog. It's the dog. How many times do I have to say dog? Have patience! We will catch that dog soon. Oh Oh. Inspector, kill that dog as soon as possible. These dogs have old rivalry against us. One dog killed my father. Another dog killed my wife.. And made me a widower. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. These dogs behave like dogs. Mr. Thakur, it seems that our death is also nearing. What rubbish! Go to your home. So late in the night? No, Mr. Thakur, I will sleep here tonight. What's there to be scared! You are right. Now go. Thoo dogs am really scary. Lift your dhoti. 0 God! It's here. It's here. 0 God! 0 god! Leave me, you doggy. Chase the Thakur. I am innocent. This is a safe place. There is no dog here. 0 God! Where did you come from? God! My daughter has woken up. I have come for that box.. Oh your intentions have become evil, huh? You don't want to give me that box. Don't give, keep it. I will get another one for my daughter. Keep it. It's Mohan. Where is he going? It seems that he is taking food for Sharada and Gopi. You are right. Catch him. Catch him. No. No. Tell me where is Gopi, Sharada and that dog? I won't tell you. Tell me. Tell me. My God! My God! He is killing me. He is killing me. This is perfect. This is perfect. 0 Moti. Leave me. I will quit Thakur's job and work for you. Leave me. I swear on my father, my grandfather.. I will not do anything wrong again. Leave me. Leave me. That dog has also killed Banwari. It's the same dog. Stop! Open the door. What are you staring at? Take that out of here. "The heart was restless, the heart is restless.." "The heart was restless, the heart is restless.."

"The heart was restless, the heart is restless.." I know it, brother Gopi, that you are innocent. Even the villagers also along with the police.. Think that you killed Mr. Ram. Only God knows how you prove yourself non-guilty. This is the cobra of the temple. Yes, it's the same cobra. The cobra is calling you. There must be something. Let's go. Let's follow him. This is Mr. Ram's camera. How did it come here? Where is the Mail taking it? Police! You shouldn't stay here. You must run away. Go away. Sharma, we must catch that mad dog. Pandey, start the van. Make it, fast. Here is that dog. Drive faster. Faster. Faster. It's gone that way. You go that way and you two come with me. - Did you get the dog? - No, sir. It fooled us. Let's go. This dog is really troubling the villagers a lot. The villagers to come out of their houses. It may kill anyone. I don't understand what your department is doing. Neither that killer is caught nor this dog is killed. We can understand it, Mr. Thakur. We are trying our best and it will be killed very soon. That's alright, but what about the killer, Gopi. Police is also chasing him, but we doubt that.. He didn't kill Mr. Ram, but someone else did it. How can you say that! He is the one who killed Mr. Ram. "But according to the postmortem report" it's been found that Mr. Ram was already killed.. By strangling him. He was stabbed later. How can that happen? Who else ca kill Mr. Ram? We will find that out. You don't worry at all. - 0k. I am not sure what you will do and when it will be. I think now I should take some action. Sir. Sir, it's the same mad dog. We should kill it. Stop! This dog can't be mad. - Master. Master. - What happened? We caught dumb Gopi and Sharada. So how are you, the new bride? You are getting very angry at your wife's helplessness. How dare you to revolt against me in spite of being my slave? No! Untie her. Leave us alone. Only the dumb will watch the show. Help! Help! Help! "Your favors..'" "Your appreciations.."
