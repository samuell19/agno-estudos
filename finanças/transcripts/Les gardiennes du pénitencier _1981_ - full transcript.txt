I agree that sending girls to the front is the best way of showing our men we care. Even officers need to relax every once in a while. It's a great idea. Thank you. Of course we both know it's only a pretext. Despite Canaris, who thinks otherwise, we know there are traitors and defeatists who plot and scheme against our fuhrer. Your idea will enable us to weed them out from our area. The commanding officer aboard the train, will get clear orders to carry out the operation as planned. He's to be promoted to Colonel, and there's an Iron Cross in store for him, if he succeeds. I'll do my best. I'm honored, sir. Unfortunately, you have not been chosen. Headquarters have chosen Elsa Ackerman, upon Hitler's own recommendation. Do you doubt my devotion to the great Reich? No... ...But it would be unfortunate if anybody learned about the project. We can't take that risk Would you open the door please. Hello. Please sit down. Would you bring out the red Heidelberg file. Hello. Where's the red Heidelberg file. Cut that out. You know why I asked you to come? - Of course. You're going to track down this man. I want him killed. I'm assigning one of my best men to you. Use your discretion, but be careful, he's smart and dangerous. The man you're looking for is a murder... ...responsible for the death of thousands of Jews. That is one of his ex-girlfriends. She was an entertainer for the SS. You know the story, both have fled to South America. I expect you to be on the next plane. Your man is now the governor of the Horizonte state prison. Pinpoint his habits. Plan out your hit and kill him. Kill him like the dog he is. Understand? Who's that? That's Cathrine the Great, who's looking for a stallion. But she won't find it, and she'll have to make do with a girl or a man, like everybody else. I must say, I wouldn't mind making love myself. She has to talk, no matter what. It's a good thing you're here. And believe me, all they think about is 'fuck!'. You're sweet, Teresa. Have you been here long? Oh, I don't remember anymore. I'm used to it now. How about you, you like it here? - Well, I've been in worse. Your being here makes it seem like heaven. But... - But what? Nestor. You know, the Governors bodyguard. I hate his guts. He's a brute. He wants to fuck me but I don't want to. How about me, huh? C'mon then, let's wail! What my body wants is a hundred horses. It's fantastic. I love animals... And they love me. And rats too. They're wonderful... True love. I am the Warden. The warden of Horizonte model prison. I'm responsible for your transfer here, I hope you appreciate it. You should, the court sentenced you to life imprisonment in Marisomis Penitentiary. Prisoners there work in the salt mines for 14 hours a day. I became aware of course of your trail. The crime for which you have been found guilty, could only be the work of an abnormal mind. In this penitentiary, you will not merely serve the time you were sentenced. Here we will endeavor to restore your mental ability. Now don't think that you'll be treated any differently than in any other penitentiary. The slightest infringement of our rules, and you're in one of our punitive cells. Take her away. Nestor... Do you remember a girl named Lola Martin Forbe? Would you say she is amenable to reason? Bring her to my quarters. I've come to thank you, you've been very kind... To have intervened in my favor with the warden. Very good, good. Get undressed. If it's my body you want, you can have it, gladly. Don't touch me! I hate to be touched. Particularly by a whole like you. Nestor... Nestor! Nestor! Nestor! Is everything quiet? - Yes, sir. We're on alert, and the guard's been doubled. That's an order from the warden. There must be a good reason for it. It'll soon be Christmas. We'll have loads of fun. And maybe presents. It's not Christmas without presents. Lots of presents, I love getting presents. A beautiful doll with long hair... I'd love a doll. You like? Will you stop bugging me. You're freaking me out. What's the matter, darling, don't I excite you? Don't you want to hold me in your arms? Will you fuck off now. Poor darling, you're not feeling very well. Tell me. What did they get you for? I killed my brother. I've said I would, but he did it, he left me for her. Come on, don't be sad, darling. He's happier than you are, in paradise. Someday, we'll have a ball. Oh Hurkley my love, come and take me. Did I scare you? - Oh, no... I was thinking about what happened to me. Tell me. - Well... ...I used to be a prostitute. Everything was cool until a sneaky cop walked in and caught me red handed. That's right, he wanted to fuck me, but I simply couldn't. Know what I mean? Then one day, I was with a John... He was a real cheap-skate. I had to weed the money out of him. And I really used to stick to my price. Turned out he was just shy. And here he was. Badge and all. He had the goods on me. Son of a bitch. Well then, that's why I'm here. And what are you here for? It's neither fish nor fowl. What's that supposed to mean? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Oh come on, aren't we happy. You and me? That spy. Come closer. I said come closer. Bitch! You wait here. I'm escorting you in personally. Looks like we're going to have a visit. So... How are you, Ingrid? Fine. Perfectly fine. What are you doing? You can't do this to anyone. Uncle Jess! Leave me alone! Uncle Jess. Come... Come, Uncle Jess. Uncle Jess. Guard! That one. You bring her to me. Come with me. - Why don't you stay instead? We'll have fun, I promise. I'll take you up on that later. But let's go for a walk first. Come on, you first. Where is the warden. Is she in her quarters? No sir. - She's probably... Good morning Governor, I'll be right down. How are you? - Not bad. I'm happy to see you my dear. They failed to notify us of your visit, Governor. Something's been brought to my attention which could have unpleasant consequences. And what is it, Governor? Read this. Your excellency. Horrible treatment is meted out to prisoners confined to a tower in the penitentiary. You could not fail to be horrified by the cruelty to which they are subjected. Who could have written that? - Certainly some inmate of yours. I'm terribly sorry. I can assure you that this sort of thing will never happen again, Governor. It would have unfortunate consequences for me. And for you, if higher authorities learnt about it. There's something familiar about this hand writing. As soon as I look in my files, I'll be able to tell you exactly who the culprit is. Now listen good ladies. I believe you all know me very well. You know that I'm not one for useless chatter, or idle threats. I've called all of you together, including those who enjoy... ...special treatment, because a very unfortunate thing has occurred. It would appear that we have among us a squealer. Yes ladies, a tattle-tale, a grass and a lousy rat. In short, a spy. I would like to know who was perverse and treacherous enough to complain about our therapy in the prison. One of you had the audacity to write to the Governor of this island, stating we keep a special cell for cruel and inhuman punishment. Fortunately, we were able to intercept the letter. It's clear. It's obvious. Someone must have helped the traitor. I mean, one of the guards, who agreed to post the letter, fully aware of it's destination and purpose. Of course, I do not expect the traitors among us of having the guts to come out in the open and repeat their accusations here. They are cowards. Vile, underhanded cowards! I am therefore compelled to sharpen discipline, which will put you all to some discomfort. I hope with your help we'll pluck out the rotten apple among us. From this day on, and until further notice, you will be put on half rations. Any breach of discipline shall be punished by a week in solitary confinement. I trust you'll recognize where your best interest lies. I want the traitors. You shall all soon realize, that your life can become a sheer living hell. I would like the new girls to know this. You are in a model correctional institution, and you shall be rewarded with preferential treatment or punished, according to your degree of cooperation. However, if you disobey orders, then believe me, I'll make an example of you, and you'll hurt. Don't be afraid. C'mon, don't show your fear. Poor girl, there's no reason to be afraid when you're with me. I'm afraid, Theresa. But why should you be scared? You didn't do anything wrong. Listen, just be nice and It'll be all right. I hate him. That's right. Be nice and everything will be all right. I just want to find out if you make love as well you write anonymous letters. I didn't do it. Leave me alone. - C'mon... ...Be nice for good old Nestor. You should be more cooperative. Theresa usually is. Come here, Theresa. Nestor knows much more than you imagine. I know him well you know. He knows you wrote that letter. But he promised not to say anything if you make love with him. So why not do it? Close your eyes. Nothing to it. What do you say, darling. Come on now... There. You sure he knows it's me? So it was you? Then tell him. Let him fuck you. Nothing to it. It'll be all right. I will. I'm the one who wrote it. I see. Let's have some fun and I won't say anything. Leave us be a minute. Come here, Theresa. Sit down. You know why I sent for you, don't you? Of course, Mr. Governor. Because I know everything that goes on in this prison. I suppose you're aware... ...of what I'd do... ...if you didn't tell me what you knew. So? It's Lola, Mr. Governor. Thank you, Thersea. I'll have you escorted back. Mr. Governor... Would you make love to me. I deserve it, don't you think? Guard! Goodbye, Theresa. Sir, I know who wrote it! Nestor... How many times do I have to tell you to knock before barging in? I'm sorry, Governor, Sir. I know who wrote the anonymous letter. I swear I do. I found out all by myself. Poor Nestor. Dear and indispensable Nestor. Now shut-up and go get me Lola. I want to talk with her. But that's why I want to talk to you. - Run along, Nestor. She's the one! - This minute! You seem a bit nervous. You owe me 17 pesos, and this time you're not going to welch out of it. Alright, I'll pay. What bothers me is this letter and if an inspector comes from the capital. He'll soon find out I'm not Dr. Moore. I wouldn't worry if I were you. The Governor has more important things to do than bother us. It's true, Nestor... Lola did write the letter. You like her, Nestor? Yes, yes. A lot sir. I like her. And with your permission... Congratulations, Nestor, you have good taste. Nestor... - Yes, Governor. Will you pick up those soldiers from the floor. I dropped them, and I believe some are broken. Buy me some new ones. But... What about Lola, Governor, sir? Lola? Oh yes, Lola. Leave her here, she'll be all right. Some more. Alone at last. Nice round handwriting. You must be highly sensual. You misspelled a word. Meted is only with one 't'. Come closer, sensuous Lola. Come closer. Open your mouth. Wider. Don't be afraid. You shall be punished, that goes without saying. You know why? For bad spelling. Sit down. You're going to write down what I dictate, using those coloured pencils. Go ahead. I want you to use a different colour for every other word. "Your excellency, horrible treatment is being meted out in your prison." "Confined in cells in the tower..." "You could not fail to be horrified." "I demand that the director comes to investigate it at once." This looks fine, Lola. I'll take you back to your cell. Tomorrow it'll be even tougher. It stinks in here! What do you call this shit!? Do you call this bed made!? Redo it! Well... Perfectly neat. That's absolutely perfect. This time you didn't make it so well. I want to see the corners nice and rounded. Go fuck yourself! - Stop it, Nestor! Come, Sandra. I'll take you back to your cell. And you, I want you to make that bed. The girl and the letter. I think we ought to... We ought to do something about it, and do it quick. You have no idea who it could be? In this prison, I would say there's only four or five girls who could write that sort of letter. I think Bertha might have done it. But I didn't tell you earlier, because... I don't want to kill anymore of these prisoners. If they find out, I'll end up in prison. You'll do exactly what I say. You'd better. Otherwise, the police might just be informed that the good Dr. Moore was murdered by a male nurse because he flunked all his exams. After which, the fake Dr. Moore, came to us, in this prison... using fake credentials. Would you pass the sugar? I like a bit of sugar in my coffee. I like everything to be sweet. I like a little ice-cream... Yes, I do. This is a pleasant surprise, we didn't expect your visit. And what do we... owe this honor to? I understand you've made an investigation. And found out who wrote the letter I received. I'd like to talk with her in private. Oh, Nestor will be with me, he's an important chequer on our board. Now, I wouldn't want our young rebel to be unduly aggressive. Don't worry, she'll be calm. Fine. I do hate unruliness. I wonder wether she might try again? I'll see to that, personally. You can rest assure that she won't. That's fine, I'm counting on you. Would you like some Cognac? No thank you, I don't drink. You see, I've got to keep cool, what with my responsibilities. Nestor. Would you bring up the car, we're leaving. Don't bother showing me to the door, I know the way. So are you going to tell me why you're here? I killed my husband. I loved him. One day I went to see my mother. But I missed the train. I went back home... They gave me 20 years. Yes they did. Shit almighty! Yeah, 20 years. That's too bad. You've been here a while, eh? When I got back... my husband was with this little bitch. In my bedroom! In my bed! There was a gun in the drawer. I took it, and shot him. What's the new ones name? - Maria. Know what she's in for? - I don't know. She's not a whore, that much I know. She never talks. How is my favorite spy... Feeling better? Anything new to report? No, Mr. Governor. But we're getting more and more crowded, with new girls arriving every day. Theresa, I plan to enlarge this jail. I'll turn it into a state where I'll be the absolute ruler. I'll utilize each individual... And make her into a spy. No more fears or worries. And I'll do it for you. I'll sacrifice my life to this community. Let's drink to it, shall we. Where from? When? You seem to be worried. Not at all. It's only Lola, she ran away. - And is that all it does to you? It's my problem. She's the one who wrote the letter. It's people like her who will poison that pretty state you want to build. It's one girl. She saved my life. I'll give her a chance to save her own. After all, if she wants to suffer... I'll give the order to let her go. - You're a kook! Concerning Lola... Let her go. In that case, I'll take care of it. Lola ran away, I'm going after her. How long are you two going to keep this up? Get going. Back home. I never tire of looking at the sea, it's so beautiful from up here. I find it revolting when people like our prisoners should live on the face of our beautiful world. Soiling it with their foul lives. It's because of them, we forget the beauty. The country around us, or how the sun sets in the sea. They should be killed, if only for that. No women interests me. That doesn't stop you from fooling around. I would say you rather enjoy it. Submitting them to horrible pain. I can't bear it. I simple can't bear it. How they cry. It's horrible. I prefer them to cry. I like to beat them up... ...and make them cry. I love it! You're no fun! Why? Why? How are you feeling? - I don't feel well at all. Why do they keep on torturing me this way? It's all over. They won't hurt you anymore. Sleep. I promise I'll protect you. I'll stop them from hurting you again. Try and relax. Calm down. Calm down. It was worse than hell. What's with her? I don't know. Some say she became crazy after staying cooped up for months in solitary confinement in some other jail. Where'd you get this? I got it from the doctor. It wasn't free, I can tell you. He often makes love with me. He's protecting me. He said... He would like to make love with you. He wants to make love with me? He said he wants a threesome. He's a bastard... But I told I told him we'll go see him tonight. Tonight. What for? We've got to get out of this god-damned jail. You might as well know, I've got a plan. Oh yeah? And her? We'll take her with us. - But how can we? We've got to get her over to the doctor. Should be easy. I know... I'll call the guard. What do you want? - It's Rosario, she's feeling real bad. I never saw her this way before. You better go tell the doctor she's having hysterics. Hurry up. - I'll go tell him. I don't want to suffer anymore. I don't want to go on suffering anymore. I don't want to suffer anymore. Please, I don't want to suffer. Bertha isn't feeling well either. Wait for me in the infirmary. I'll take a look at her in a minute. Let's get undressed. Very well, what's wrong with you? Where does it hurt? I feel weak all over. Bertha doesn't feel any too good either, could you take a look? Let's feel your pulse. I'm nervous all the time, doctor. I can't sleep at night. Does it hurt? Poor girl. What you need is love. Lots of love. I'm dying. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. What's wrong? What's wrong? Calm down. There's nothing wrong with you. Come on Rosario, we're going out for a stroll. Along the seashore, alright? Yes, by the sea. Come on. Hurry up. Don't just stand there. - Come on. Hurry. Come on, this way. I'm not going. I'm not going with you. - Come on. No, I'm not going. - Come back. No, I want to stay here! - Great! Come on! Come on, hurry up. Let me go. They're waiting for us. Come on Rosario, hurry up. - No! Get away from me! I said come on. Hurry up. I'm tired, I don' think I can go on anymore. Where are we going? Why didn't you leave me there, in bed? I want to go back to bed. We're almost there, c'mon. I want to go back. I want to go back. I don't like walking. I'm holding you back. Please, please. The sea is too far. I don't want to go to the sea. I'm not going, I'm not going. - Oh, c'mon. Come on. You'll soon get some rest. Tomorrow we'll be on a boat, you'll see. A boat? A big boat. You mean a yacht, with a captain? - Yes. Come on, it's hot. You're nice. Come on girls, we must... - We're all done-in. We've got to get some rest or we'll never make it. If we don't... But we've got to keep on going... I'm beat. What are you doing? We shouldn't stop. We should keep on going. What are you stopping for? Nobody ever listens to me. So, sweet Theresa, you brought us back Lola, huh. She's such a good friend. You know I love the governor so much, I'd do anything for him he could possibly want. It didn't cost me anything. I'll give you a reward. Nestor! The sea. We made it. - We did it. Excuse me you three. Don't move. C'mon, hurry. Let's beat it. That's it, boy. This is it. Let's go in. Please Governor... Listen to me. Come in. You are expected.
