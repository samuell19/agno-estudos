Hello my loves and welcome to the Venus experience. In this guided meditation you are loved, you matter. The wholeness that you are looking for is within you. The universe is trying to tell you something. Take a deep breath. Ask yourself, what are you running away from? Oh my God. I don't know why you still got that thing in our house. You know because she's inspired a lot of my inspiration. Oh! Yo. Tarantulas... ♪ White girl twerk, white girl twerk... ♪ "Becky, can I get a bottle? Bitch?" Fuck your bottle. Yo, this is crazy. What's that? Another unfortunate letter. I'm sorry. It'll come. - It'll happen. - Yeah. - Yo! - Yeah. - Yo! What's up, man? - What's up? - What's up? - How're you doing? Yeah, yeah. You good? Good?

I'm doing this little piece, man. - Got DJ Pete. - Peep the merch, peep the merch. - My ex-girlfriend. - Yeah. For sure. - What? - Yeah, she left me in some shit. what's up? What's good? Check this shit out. Shut up, nigga. Damn. - What up? - Yo! That bitch looks mad familiar. Bitches love being called bitches, it's a part of life. Don't listen to this stupid ass nigga. Look like I have... I have a philosophy. What's the philosophy? Let's hear the philosophy. - Preach, brother. - Thank you for the claps. Thank you for the claps. - Thank you for the claps. Check it out. - All right. Most women want men that run shit - not a sensitive man. - Said no woman ever. Oh, so when you point at me you're trying to say I'm a sensitive dude? - Are you still celibate? - Come, on man, chill. Your energy is fucking my energy up right now. I need you to fucking go across the street. Time out, nigga. Bye. Stop playing and get all this pussy that's out here, homey. Hey! Hey. Do you remember me? Remember you... you gave me a painting? - Was in this alley. - Got it. I do remember you. - Yeah! - I do. I do remember you. - Oh, shit! That's so weird... - I know. Hey, can I have a cigarette? For sure. And a light? It's your turn. Hold on. - Thank you. - Yeah. That's crazy how you just remember me like that. - Yeah. - Yeah. I love your painting. - You did? - It felt very personal. - Yeah, it is. - 'Cause it said, "Remember me on it", but you don't remember me. So that's kind of fucked up. You know, I once read that smoking is a lazy man's meditation. I used to read a lot of self-help books. But now I just have a therapist. I'm gonna start meditating and then stop smoking. Yeah. No, word. Meditation is... I meditate. - You do? - Meditate is... Yeah. It's... You seem so enlightened. - I'm still smoking though. - That's true. Yeah. I know, you can meditate and smoke... - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, do you live around here or something? No, I... I live in New York. Got it. I've just been here for a few days... ...cleaning out my dad's stuff. He died recently... so... I'm sorry to hear that. Sorry. I know you're probably like, "Who's this crazy bitch - telling me all of her stuff?" - No. Why would I call you a bitch? - I don't even know you to call you a bitch. - No, no, no. Don't worry. I... No... I'm thinking... You said I think you're a bitch... Don't worry, bitch, fuck and ho. - Whoa! - Those are like my three favorite words. - Wow, that's... that's aggressive. - Yeah. - I'm Ruby. - Hey, Ruby, what's up? I'm Hunter. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'm a hugger. - Oh. - Mm... - Did you feel that? - Yeah, I felt it. - I love hugs. - Yeah, sure. No, come on. You felt it too. - Didn't that feel... - No... It was nice. It was very nice. It was a good energy exchange. There's nothing like a good ass hug. - A good ass hug. - And I love your hair. I love your style. - Mm. - You have a very cool style. - Very cool hair. - Thank you. So cool. How do you keep it like that? This is just naps and just... ...got stuck together. How do you do your hair like that? This area has changed a lot. Yeah, gentrification. It's cute. - It's cute? - It's cute. I mean... ...it was a shit hole and now it's... it's getting cute. Shit hole? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Gentrification is a hole... I wouldn't say that if I were you. I think there's... ...many things to gentrification. Can you boil that down for me? Meaning, like, gentrification is like... ...people have been living there for years and years, and then they get kicked out, and then new people move in with money, and so... I wasn't thinking about it in terms of the people, - I was thinking about it.... - No... I'm not... Yeah... I'm not... - ...in terms of the way that it looks. - Got it. Yeah. I'm not trying to make you feel better about that. That's a very... That's a conversation we probably shouldn't touch. - Who? - No. I'm just saying that... that gentrification is a conversation that you... you said it's cute and I don't... I think that it's just... That... You can't really say that. Like, you don't... You know, people lose their homes. Anyway. Whatever. Uh... I think you're missing the point here. You're making me feel like an awful person. - Yeah. Yeah. - I hate change. Change is fucking up my whole life right now. Fuck change, fuck change, and fuck gentrification. Fuck it. Hold the fists up, girl. You... That... I mean Hold the fists up. - Ok, Hunter. - Uh, yeah. Woo! It's getting late. All right. - It was nice meeting you. - It was cool, yeah. It was a really cool little chat. It's like a crazy university. It's like... Not to sound cheesy, but it's like, I met you over there, like... - Maybe I'll meet you again. - Yeah, maybe. I know. - Hey. - Yeah. - When you meet me again... - Yes. - ...remember who I am. - Mm-hmm. Maybe, for sure. Yeah, for sure. I won't forget who you are. - Ruby. - I will remember you, Miss Ruby. Yes. Have a good day. - You too. Bye - Cool. Bye. - Peace. Take care. - Bye. Hey! Hmm? - Do you want to hang out? - What's up? Do you want to hang out with me? Like, now? Like... yeah. You're not afraid I'm like a serial killer or something? Little bitch. You're mine now, motherfucker. Motherfucker! Yo, yo, Cleo! Cleo! Yo, baby! - What's wrong? - Make sure I don't... I'm just saying, how far you want this to go? It's cool, but literally... Ok. I thought you're into this. No. Look at this beautiful woman putting me on. Hunter... ...would you please stop filming me? Yeah, I'm... I'm really excited. Thank you so much for believing in me. You know, my first show? I owe you everything, baby. Good for you. Is this your new painting? I don't get the new direction. Keep it about the struggle... ...and Black rage. That's what it sells. Look... ...that's what the people want to feel. Ok? Not this one? Yo. Yo! What up? What's up? Johnny's fuck ass. We were supposed to go eating, and he flaked. - What's up with your seat belt? - Word. Yo! Don't say that shit like that. - That's fucked up. - Yo! Stop. Why are you gonna talk about my car like that? You better chill. Who's giving a fucking ride? Yeah! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Uh, hello? How are you? - Hi. - I'm Hunter Leonards. Um, yeah, I'm one of the feature artists here trying to put a... - just figuring out where I place my stuff. - Right. I'll be down there. All right. Hey, what's up? How're you? - Good. - Good. Yeah... I'm so, yeah, I'm... I have some paintings that I need to put up. Cool. Um. So we're thinking of setting up your stuff over here. All these paintings... I have a lot... - I have... more in the car. - Oh! That's... You have more than... one. I... I... I have all of them. There must be a mistake. Do you want to call Cleo? Can you just give her a call, - and make sure... - Actually I just spoke to her, and she said - you only get one piece in this show. - Are you sure? That's like weird. 'Cause I just actually... ...I just saw her. You s... Ok. How are you? I'm good. Really? Be real. I am being honest. It's like... Uh... I'm so tired of that bitch. - Yeah. Don't call... Don't call her a bitch... - For real. - She's crazy. - I know... I know she's... She's crazy as fuck. And not like... I'm not just saying that... I know men like to call crazy all the time, but, like, - she's legit crazy. - No, she... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I... Listen... Listen, Henny... Henny, I love her, all right? Just like you love Johnny, I love her. I'm sorry. - Stop laughing at me. - I can't even take you seriously when you say that. Come on, now. Love is not a transaction. Come on, now. Why you gotta do that? Don't. Thanks for meeting me. Of course. I've just been kind of going through it. What's up? You know. Johnny. The usual. Well, but now... You're crazy. But, you know, always... He don't believe in me. You know, he just, um... ...he signed somebody else to his label. He didn't listen to my song yet. For real. It's like... I don't know. I'm just tired. I think... I think I need a break. Like, I just need to go and... ...figure out... ...me again, and like... ...my own self-worth, you know. Like, just... I feel like we both need space. But, you know, one day. Mm-hmm. One day Johnny is going to see my potential. He's gonna put me on. He would want to make me his girlfriend too. - We're playing. - Yeah, one day, Henny, You're gonna be successful as shit. You'll make a lot of money. And anybody in life that doesn't allow it, just fuck them. Right? Money would be cute. I like money. - Money will be cute. - That's you... - I love you, yo. - I love you too. We're gonna do this shit. Ah! We're gonna do this shit! Hendrix, we gonna do this shit. Yeah! We're gonna do this shit! We're gonna do this shit! We're gonna do this shit! We're gonna do this shit! - Yo, you got some weed? - Are you serious? - You got some weed? - Uh, yeah, I'm Ok. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Hello, my loves. Welcome to the Venus experience. I'm happy you made the choice to nurture your body, mind and spirit by meditating today. Sit in a comfortable, quiet place to begin our session. I found you the painting. I found the star. - It's beautiful. - Do you believe that? - It's interesting. - Look. - Do you like the color? - It's nice. Hey. I was looking for you. You said you wanted to talk. I give you good news. You know the French collector, Pierre, I told you about? He's here. And he... listen, listen! Good news! He loves your painting. That's cool. Listen to me. It's what you always wanted. You get paid for. You get paid. Precisely. We both will. It's delicious. It's happy time. Come on. Give me a kiss. I love those lips. It's very special. Hey, Pierre, meet Hunter. Hunter, meet Pierre. - Enchantée. - Nice to meet you. This is the artist. I love your painting. It's perfect. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, I've been telling Hunter that those explorations of Black effect are exactly the social political aesthetic interventions - we need in this moment. - I agree. I love it. I want to buy it. I'm sorry. It's actually already sold, sir. But thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Where's my fucking lighter? Oh, fuck. Yo, uh, can I borrow your light? Thank you. - Thank you... - You're welcome. ...for sure. Did you paint that? - Yeah. - I like it. It's cool. You can have it. Really? Thanks. Wow. So Basquiat of you. You know, Henny, you know what it is that, "Oh, I need... the Black struggle, and I need to stay in the Black box, and I'm like, "What the fuck you know about being Black?" Fuck putting my art in a box. True. I don't like being put in a box either. At least you know your art is worth something now, right? I mean as cliché as it sounds, when one door closes, another one opens. All right? Look at me and my music. I don't know what the hell I'm out here doing. But I'm doing it. Right? Henny, real talk, those doors are an illusion. Do you understand that? They're not real. But you only need one... ...or you can manifest your own. Well, you weren't in love with Cleo. No shade, like, I think you were just using each other. Like she was using you... ...as a boy toy. Like, look at your patterns. Every time you meet a pretty girl, and you put her on a pedestal, and then - she emasculates you, I mean... - Fuck. - ...that's your pattern, like... - I do that. Everybody has a pattern and shit. I'm not saying - mine is any better. - I gotta stop, I gotta stop. I gotta stop, yo. - You do. - I'm done with this. This is my life. You feel me? This is my fucking life. - True. - I'm gonna focus on me. I'm gonna get my shit together. I don't want to talk to no one. I'm not falling in love ever again. I'll be fucking celibate. Maybe you should be celibate with that bottle first. Why the fuck, you act like I have a fucking problem or something? Don't come at me like that. - Why would you say that? - I'm just saying. Maybe give up sex. Maybe give up drinking and drugs for a month, and see how you feel. Just like a cleanse. You know, just a reset. That's all. - It's time to focus on your art. - That's right. - I'm... Hmm, I'm so fucking ready. - Time to be happy. - Do your fucking art. The only relationship... - I'm so... ...you need to be focused on is you, God... ...the universe, and your art. 'Cause... ...we're some fucking self-made bitches out here. You just called me a bitch. You know, this is really random. - What're you doing? You're taking a selfie? - Yeah. I thought you don't take selfies. No, I'm not really into social media. You know, I just don't see the point, and because... I don't know. - Not my thing. - What does that mean? You're an artist? You curate content for a living, similar to the way that I do. How do you make money if you don't curate content that people like? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I paint and then sell paintings, trying to get my shit out there. Do odd jobs. How do people see your art then? That's just... That's really no way to market yourself. So, you're not making any money. And do you live in your car? It all makes sense now. No, I just don't believe in blasting every detail of my personal life in social media. - I love L.A. - I know. These palm trees, and you see the Hollywood sign right there. Ok. I know what we should do. What? - We're going to the beach. - The beach? We're going to the beach. The beach. Can you help me open your door? - Twice pull? - No, wait, I got it. I got it. Why do you make it look so easy? - Make sure your feet are in. - They're in. - Now, close. All right? - Yep. - Safe? Put on your seat belt. - You almost... - ...you almost hit your Tiki man. - Put on your seat belt. - And your bowl, but... - Put on... Listen, don't touch anything. Is my... You... You can't come a person's place... - Also... - You can't... Listen. Hey, this is gonna be cool, but you can't get into that man's place, and start moving things around, all right? Listen, I'm just letting you know that you need to get there. I've got the map. What are you doing, yo? Taking a selfie. - Oh, you're taking a selfie? - Yeah. - Shit. - So, what? It's good for your brand. - Your brand? - What? Nothing. I'm just saying that I... next time just ask before you... What are you doing? - Smile! - Put it down! I can't see what I'm doing anyway. Wanna get some ice cream? Yeah. Hey, let's go get your camera. All right. Let's go. Yo, we're like kind of... Ooh! - where did this come from? - What are you doing? - I love bikes, especially pink bikes. - You don't... - That's not your bike. - Yeah, but it's Ok. Get on. - No, I'm not getting on that... - Come on, get on the bike, get on the bike. Get on the bike, you don't trust my driving sense? No, I'm just saying this bike is really small. - I just want to see if we can do it. - Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, you stole my bike, lady! My bike! Oh, God, jeez, I'm sorry little girl. - Lady, get your own bike. - Ok. Take your bike back, be careful. Don't talk to strangers. - Yeah, we're sorry. Don't tell anybody. - Stay away from... You should be ashamed of yourselves. Just go. What are you doing? - What? I was... - How are you gonna take a little girl's bike? No, I was taking it for like a loop. No, but this is Venice, you get banged on, you can't just - take some random little girl's bike. I told you. - She was literally... - You think she's gonna beat me up? - You look ridiculous right now. I love the camera. I love creating memories. You... you need to be a cheetah. - A cheetah? - Yeah. - All right, I'm done filming you. - Woo. I'm done filming you. I know what I'm good at, gonna stick to that. So nice. Doesn't it feel relaxing? - Uh, it does. - Like... ...an overwhelming sense of calm. You know? No, uh, say, like, the water, when it comes to the ocean, water takes all your pain, worries. - Yeah. - Do you hear that sound? Hear that sound? Doesn't it just calm you? It's like you throw all your issues. And the ocean just takes it back. Yeah. How old are you? - I'm 33. - Damn. You're old as fuck. Damn. You just... I didn't know I was fucked. Well, I just had a quarter life crisis because I turned 25. - Quarter life crisis! - But 33. Damn. That's really good. Something funny? Do you have a girlfriend? Um, no, no. Not at the moment. Really? Huh. Any particular reason? Gonna take a little break. Taking a heartbreak? That's what they call it. So what do you want to do after this? Actually, I wanna see if you wanna hang out more. My best friend, she is having a birthday party, and she's an artist. She has really dope music. And it's gonna be super low key, not a lot of people, but if you want to come. I mean you don't have to come. You don't have to feel pressure or whatever. What? I'm really sorry about your car. Now I gotta clean my fucking car. - Now I gotta clean up my fucking car. Look what you did. - Oh, shit. - I know. - I have to clean up. I thought that napkin was for me. Done. Here. All right. Give me this. Oh, God.. So, I have to go to this party like this? Well, yeah, you're fine. - I'm sorry about your windshield. - No, it's all good. I'm your coach. Wait, wait, wait. let me get it, let me get it... Oh, shit. All right. Hold on. I think I have something in the car. So you live here? Yeah. This is like me... sorry. Me and my roommate, we moved in here. - It's like a little compound situation. - Cool. - Oh, shit. Hey! - Hey, honeys. - What's good? There you are. - Happy birthday. Oh, hello, gorgeous. Who's this? - Uh, we met... She's basically... - He gave me a painting and we're basically best friends now. I'm Ruby. Oh hi. That sounds about right. I'm Henny. Nice to meet you. - You're gorgeous. - Thank you, likewise. Would you like a splash? - Sure. - I think we're gonna be friends. I was messaging with this 22-year-old on a fucking app the other day. Offered me a threesome right away. Dude. I'm not even kidding you. Are you going to re-tell? - Hey. You want... Hey you... - Hey. Yeah, of course. - You go in that. Go, go ahead. - Ok, gangster. She's not a lightweight. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Where is your drink? - Uh, I'm good. - I'm not drinking. - Why? Because I just don't feel like drinking. Mmm. You know one of those nights you just wanna get fucked up? Just like fuck it, fuck it. Like, fuck the pain away. - Like Peaches... - Whatever, but yeah. Ok. Well, children, I'm gonna go to the attic and play my song. - Hey. - Damn. This is vibey. I like what you've done with the place. Ah! Oh, she's like an IG influencer.

You're not led by money. - It's honorable. - Yeah, but I don't know if that's a smart thing, Pierre. - You know, that's my space. - Oh, this space is yours. - Oh, this is dope, man. Very cool space. - Do you like it? Well, thank you. It used to be my art studio, but, uh, I don't have your talent so I don't paint anymore. Look... If you ever need anything, I mean a matter of fact... Know now that you have something because this is my space. See you soon, Hunter. Ladies and gentlemen. Bonjour. I'm Pierre. I love this love. I... I have something very special today. Something that you may really much enjoy. It's hard for me to explain because it only needs to be experienced. I'm gonna introduce someone that creates something that is... is something that, again, can only be felt. Shush. Everybody breathe into your belly... - ...and exhale with an "ah." - Ah! As we come to the end... ...I want to thank all of you for coming here releasing with us today. We are supposed to live a full ultimate life. The good, the bad, all of it. We are all here to play a role. Remember... we are loved. We are light... we are present. I've never done anything like that before. I know because you haven't been hanging out with me. - True. - It was cathartic, right? - So cathartic. - Very cathartic. - See, that's when you hang out with me. - Good for the soul. Good for the soul. - Ok. - I feel, like, liberated on a whole other level. - That's great. - Don't you? - Yeah. You want to just chill for a second? - Yeah. Actually, I feel like I need to, like, come down from that. - Yeah, thanks for taking me. - Of course. I was a little skeptical at the beginning. Sorry about that. But that was so fun. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. - Yo. - Hunter. So what are you doing, yo? I'm just saying, what are you doing? - Are you gay? - Yo. I'm not kidding. Are you gay? I don't understand. What am I missing here? - Yo, Ruby. - Why are you so awkward? - What's the deal? - Ruby. Listen. I'm not like any of these dudes you meet. Ruby, all right? You need to understand that. Ok, so you're not into it, That's fine. No. It's not that I'm not into it. Of course you're an attractive girl, but it's like I'm not gonna play this game with you. - I'm just trying to like... - You don't have to say anything else. - I get it. You're not into it. - No, it's Ok 'cause you're used to getting what you want. 'Cause you're an internet model. So you should just get anything you want. What does that have to do with me being my... What? You're an asshole. Internet model? - I don't come at you like that. - Please. I don't even know you to be arguing like this. - You know what? You're so fucked up. - Ok, I am fucked up. Trying to say that I'm an Instagram model. I built myself from the ground. - Get out. - Fuck you. Ok. Bye. Your junkie ass car with the door that doesn't work. Fuck. Yo, yo, Ruby. Where are you going? - I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. - I'm getting an Uber. - Why, are you mad? Just because you can't figure me out? - Yeah. - Listen, I'm sorry. - I'm leaving. Just get back in the car. Just get back in the car, Ruby. I'm sorry. Just because I didn't try to kiss you, huh? Ruby, maybe you need to respect yourself. Respect myself? - Yeah, respect yourself. - How dare you? You don't know enough about my situation to tell me what to respect. Fuck you! I'm leaving and don't fucking follow me. - Chill. Chill please, chill. - I am chill! - What's the problem? - Ma'am? - Is everything Ok? - Yes! Have you ever seen two adults argue? Obviously we've seen that, ma'am. I need to step over here. - We're trying to make sure everything is Ok. - For what reason, sir? Really? Do you know who I am? Google me. - I'm reaching into my pocket to get my... - Oh no, you... - No, don't give them shit. - If you're smart, give me your ID. - No, chill. - No, no, no, no. You're not giving them anything.

Hang loose. How do you feel? You look really good in this light. - Are you ever present? - I am being present. - No, you're not. - I'm in the presence of an artist. Yeah. Ok. Are you ever present when you have your camera? Don't make fun of the way I run my business. I am a content creator. This is my art. People enjoy the things I create. It's exactly like your job. You have to sharpen that shit. You want to go upstairs? Sure. - Oh. - Good morning. - What's up? - Be careful. It's hot. - Oh, yes. It's hot as shit. - I can tell you've been celibate for a while. Yeah. Then don't make it weird. I'm not. Honestly, I was, like, impressed. What? Shit, I have to pack. Yeah. So... - Sweet, I'm gonna miss you. - I know. I was thinking the same thing. You can come with me if you want. What? To New York? Yeah. - I'll come with you. - You want to... Really? Yeah, I've always wanted to go to New York. I actually have a bunch of people you can meet. Yeah. I don't want just them. Oh, so sweet. Me neither. - Ok. - I'm not going to get hurt. - I don't understand why you making a big deal. - Ok. It just feels fast. It's like... It's always 0 to 100. It just feel like you're doing that thing that you do again. Like... - Ok. - Every time a girl comes in your life, you forget about who you are, you drop everything for her and then I'm left to, like, help you pick up the pieces. Yeah, but that's what friends are. But I'm trying to tell you that it's different this time. It's crazy. You're making this a lot bigger than it is. You're making this a big deal. She has some people in the art scene that I could meet. All right? That's the only reason why I'm going. I'm going there. I'm gonna hustle. I'm gonna chill. Which I should be doing. She's just trying to help me. That's it. Like Cleo was trying to help you? - You need to trust me. - Ok. - Ok. You need to trust me. All right. - All right, relax, relax. - You love her. - It's different. Most different. Ok. - Ok. - It's different. - All right? - All right. - I love you. - I love you too. And, and I... listen, I appreciate you. I appreciate you caring, but it's like... I just don't want you to get hurt you. That's it. - Yo, I'm not going to get hurt. - Right. I'm not going to get hurt, yo. I love you. Where? What club is this? - Watch your head. - Are we getting a night cab? You didn't tell me you were taking me home. - I am taking... - You're so boring. - Oh wow. - You need to go to bed. Well... Put your feet here. Go to bed. You're tired. So, do you want to be best friends? I want to be best friends. But I need you to go to sleep. You want some water? - No. - Ok. - Snacks only. Like pizza? - Sh-shh. Do you like me? Of course I like you. No, I ordered 50 in the orange and 60 in the black. Let's start with the black. I ordered silk. The jumpsuits have always been in silk. You gave me chiffon. Hello. This guy is such a dick. Ok. I'll be done soon. Oh, and I set a meeting for you with my art friend. He's great. You'll love him. And he's a big deal. So don't be late. I texted you the info. Yes, I'm still here. Uh, Francisco? - What's up, man? - Hold up. Yeah, I'm, uh, Ruby's friend. The artists that... I sent you an email about my work. My art, remember? Oh... Hunter. - Yeah. - Ruby's friend. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Goddamn that girl was so hot, huh? Ruby? Ooh-hoo-hoo. Yeah, I know. Anyways, man, my work. Like, I'm really excited to get your feedback and tell me what you think. well, I liked your earlier stuff. Uh, that shit was Black experience. That was some real shit. The shit that I saw, that was some real Black struggle shit. I want to see... ...I want to see what else he had in that field. Let me explain you this. We don't listen to JAY-Z and 2pac to hear about them explore life, nah, I want to hear about where they came from. You know what I mean? That's Black strength. Not Black exploration. We come from the gutter around here. That's what's up. We want to sell that. That's... that's the streets, that's what it is. So, what I saw. I didn't hear your voice. I want to see that. I want to hear. I want to feel. I want to taste. I want to touch that Black voice. I want that. I didn't see that in that email. I want some real shit. So when you work on that. Get it. - Yeah, man. All right, yo. - Yeah. Thank you for letting me come. I appreciate it. It was cool. You know. Thanks for checking out my shit. And, um, yeah, man, enjoy your day, brother. All right then. Hey, the handle turns to the right, to the right. - All right. Yeah. - Yeah, thanks, man. - Hold up, baby. What's up? How are you? - Hey. - Oh, my God. What is that smell? - My bad. You stepped on my toe. - Sorry. - It's Ok. These shoes are really painful. - I was just making you dinner. That's all. - I can see that. I can smell it. - Yeah. - For sure. I'm making, uh, a shrimp pesto, garlic, lemon, fettuccine Alfredo. - So sweet of you. Really appreciate that. - Thank you. But one, I don't cook in here, and I'm allergic to shellfish. - Oh. - Yeah, it's Ok. - Don't worry. - I was just trying to make you dinner 'cause I knew you had a long day. My bad. It's totally fine. I can order something and I'll probably... I'll just go open all the windows. - Don't worry. - So you don't like the smell of garlic. - No, not in my sheets, probably not. - Oh, that's crazy, yeah. - Let me know if you want anything from the delivery. - Yeah, no, I'm good. My bad. If I knew you didn't like garlic, I wouldn't have made, I wouldn't... my sorry, my bad. How did the meeting with Francisco go? - Oh, with your boy? - Yeah. Oh, dude likes my old stuff better, he said, the Black experience. You know the... the Black struggle. Yeah, I mean, he's an interesting cat. He clearly has his agenda. You know, I just wanna... I just wanna make art. I completely understand what you're saying. I don't think you should ever feel like you have to do one thing. I just think, I think Francisco was really smart and I think he knows what people want to see. The Black experience is cool for people. People think being Black is really cool and you should lean into that. Being Black is cool, Ruby? It's not... I'm not saying that the Black is cool. I'm saying that... I'm not trying to offend you. No, you're not, you're not offending me. I just want you to hear me, like, I want you to understand me. I understand what you're saying. I'm sorry. I'm just saying, I don't want to just make art about being oppressed. I don't want to make art about being, like, angry and, like, a statistic, you know? If it's working, why change it? That's really what I mean. Yeah, but, Ruby, like, honestly I just wanna do me, all right? - I want to do you. - What? What, Hunter? Just, why are you being so weird? - Just... - I kind of want to... I kind of want to go home. Really? Ok. Well, then let's go home. Good morning. So, what's up? You, uh, busy today? I have a meeting and I'm late. I was thinking maybe we could hang out later? Chill if you're not doing anything. No, I'm... I'm going to be really late. It's a late one for me, but have a great day and I'll see you later. Ok? Smile.

I'm letting you fucking me up. No. You just can't handle hearing the truth. The truth? The truth is you're vain as fuck, Ruby. Your whole identity is a highlighted and curated fucking timeline. All right? You're fucking narcissistic. You're arrogant, you are self-entitled. Don't fucking come for me right now. I don't care about what it looks like. You don't care about what it is, if the truth was standing in front of your face right now, you wouldn't know who it is? Look at me. Look at me. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't.

No, I ju... I'm not mad about nothing. I just feel like it's that I'm just trying to get everything out. - All the bullshit. - All right. - All the issues and I'm just like... - The real? The real, and I'm leaning into that and... Are you scared? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm scared. - It's your ego. It's everything is taking the whole... It's taken a hit, it's your transformation time. But it's coming out right. Right? It's, uh... ...scary. Like, how the fuck do you sell truth? By being your true authentic self. This card I pulled, this is your superhero. You're going to be who you are. You're gonna let the truth be revealed and be incomparable. You have to find your strength. This is you. When you're ready, that fear, scared, it's going to trigger your superpower. It has to be in you. Submit to it. Give in. What matters is the art. How you're being truthful to yourself in the art. You have to give in. That's how you saw the truth. That's fine. The shadow side shows you what you need to know. It's all a part of you. There's a part of you that has been hindered as a child that was held back. You never gave yourself permission to understand. Or to feel. Well now, through your art, it's coming out. Be Ok with it. Whether it's regarded as good or bad. It's all you. It's all light, it's perfect. It's who you're supposed to be. Give in. Submit. It's hard. I'm scared, you know? That's why I'm looking at my life and I'm like, "What am I sacrificing?" Right? - Yeah. - Like, am I sacrificing to be trending? Am I sacrificing to be rich, have money? To not be happy, you know. I'm just scared, Alo. - Of what? - Because I'm fucking 33. I'm not married, I don't have no kids. I have no family. Give into it. - It'll be Ok. - Yo, I shouldn't even be in this mind frame because... No, you just got paid. - I just got paid for my art, right? - You just got paid. All right. Yo, I'm gonna be over there and kick it 'cause I need to get a, like, create a vibe after this beautiful reading you just did. And, uh, I appreciate you. Just read me, boy.

Um... ...I'd like to say thank you for coming out tonight. Thank you for being here. If you guys know me, you know that this is a big deal for me and I really appreciate you guys coming out to support this journey of art that I've been kind of going through. Uh... ...this is what I've been working on and uh... ...I hope you enjoy. I create spaces for my truth. I open myself up to everything, my fears, my struggle, my vulnerability, my anxiety, my identity, my love, my addiction, myself, ego trying to be a circle in the square at the box you choose to put me in, the box you create out of fear to contain my gifts for your... America, land of the free. Is it freedom? When you're a good egg, ready to hatch. But afraid to fly, and all you want to do is fly. But you have broken wings of doubt. The train. The Matrix. You're human. So, humans, show me your teeth. This is life. This is life. This is life. Congratulations. - You finally did it. - Thank you. How you been? I've been good.
