Where did you learn to make stuff like this? Where did you get the feathers? You used your eagle feather. Arrows do not fly so good without feathers. Yeah, but I thought it was sacred, or something. And... how did you get your feather? My grandfather told me how to get it from the eagle. When did he do that? When he decided I was ready to be a warrior. Oh. When that day comes for you, I will know. And you will know, too, I think. Grandfather: When our people first came to this earth, there was much they didn't know. They also had to learn to make weapons to hunt, so they could live. And they learned this well and the earth was full then with many buffalo and deer and beaver, but they had to learn, too, that these were a gift from the earth mother and not to take more than they needed. For when a gift is given and not cared for, there might not be any more. Stories and songs were made to tell the good things they had learned... And great warriors prayed that their sons would sing good songs, too, so these things would never die. Tomorrow, you will go to the sacred Springs where the warriors went to pray. There you can listen to your heart. Go the way I said. Look for the tracks of the ghost deer, the elk. Watch the way the light falls and for the signs that Mark the path. Follow the song of the water you will hear on the wind. Then let your spirit feel the spirits of all the warriors who went before you to this place. Their spirits are still there, all around you. Walk as they walked. See it as they saw it, and become as one with them.

[ Engine revving] Wait! Come back here! [ Engine fading] ♪ ♪ [ Muffled yelling] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [ Birds chirping] Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa, I got three warriors back. Guy, you should have seen those horses run. I let every single one out. What's wrong? [ Snickers] Boy, oh, boy. Is this the warrior you been mumbling about, chief? [ Laughs] You know, I really can't believe this. [ Snickering] Was it you let them horses out and everything? Huh? Locked old pat in the back of the truck? Huh? Was it? Was it? I'll blow your brains out! How'd you like that, huh?! Where are the keys to the truck? Where are they?! By the corral. Well, you better hope you can find them. The guy could suffocate in there. Take him to his keys. Are you alright, grandpa? You come along, too... You know? To keep your brave warrior here from doing anything stupid. He can't walk. He's hurt. Is that right? Alright... You take off them arrows, the knife and stuff and you lay it over there. Bring your friend along.Leave him alone! Don't touch that horse. Now, listen! You two have cost me a fortune, a fortune up here today! Now, you get that stuff off and you get them keys. Don't you do anything really. [ Nickering] Don't do anything. I just want them keys. Now, come on. Come on! [ Neighing] Come on. [ Crickets chirping] [ Sniffs] Shoot, I... Steve: Ain't you found them yet? Can't see. It's too dark. Well, use your hands. Feel around. Can't you remember where you put them? No. "I can't find them," I said. Get looking! You'll crawl every inch of this mountain if that's what it takes! Now, you get them keys and you get them quick! If you don't find them I'm going to bust this horse's head open with this rifle! I'm telling you! You better believe it! Now, get looking. Don't look at me! Look for the keys! Come on! Don't you get any ideas! Where are you? You find them? You listening to me? [ Gasps] Don't you try taking off! Are you alright? Grandfather: Go. [ Panting]: Go. Steve: Hey! Hey!

I said, answer me! [ Arrow thuds] What are you doing?! [ Hooves galloping] You crazy?! Damn you! [ Moaning softly] [ Doors opening] Hammond: Come on. Get out. Chuck: Come on, man. Get up there and just shut up! [ Grunting] Git! You're in a lot of trouble here. Huh? You know that? Somebody's got to help me! Hammond: These horses are protected by the wild horse and burro act, public law 92-195 and you're in violation of federal act. Do you realize that?! Huh? [ Moaning] Somebody's got to help me! What gives you the right to kill these horses?! Huh? Do you realize that these horses are almost extinct?! Huh? Do you?! [ Panting] Yeah, you lay there! It's people like you that ruin this country. You know that? [ Pounding] You just ruin it. [ Pat's muffled voice yelling] What's that? Th-that's pat. He's still in there. The chubby one? Leave him there. [ Panting] Where'd you get... Where'd you get that arrow in your leg? Huh? [ Grunts painfully] [ Horse nickers] [ Hoofbeats approaching slowly] He is one big thief. [ Chuckling] Hey, uncle. How's your bones? Very tired. How you feel? Well... Still got the... Signal fire to put out, but... [ Panting] I'm okay. [ Panting] [ Chuckles] Yeah. We caught them, didn't we, chief... Michael? Don't go too far. [ Laughter] You ride so well. I'm proud of you. Your father would be proud of you, too. Mom... I don't want to go. I want to stay here. Oh, Michael, we can't stay here. You know that. We've got to go back. Why? Why can't we stay here? Michael, we've been through all this before. Now, please... Go get your things. [ Laughs] I didn't think it would be hard for US to leave. I want to thank you for all the things you taught Michael. I guess we all learned a lot. Tila... I know how you feel-- I understand-- and I'm glad you brought US back here. Michael: Who's going to take care of three warriors? Tell her we should stay. I don't want to go, grandpa. Tell her we have to stay here. Going away is the first lesson we are taught... And the last we learn. You have learned the old ways, Michael... But they are not the only way. Yours is a new song. It is the song of a proud warrior. This song will stay in your heart as you learn the new ways. You will come back to US. Good-bye, grandpa. Good-bye, grandpa. I love you. [ Whickers] Well, tila... [ Whickering] Take good care of him for me, okay? Michael... Thanks a lot. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
