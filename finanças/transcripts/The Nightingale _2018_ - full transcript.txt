Company, general salute! Present arms! Shoulder arms! We are honored to welcome Captain Goodwin to our post. We trust your visit here will be a fruitful one, captain. To start the evenin' off I'd like to call on our little nightingale to sing a good old British love song for all us homesick lads. ♪ As I went walking one morning in May ♪ ♪ I met a young couple ♪ ♪ So fondly did stray ♪ ♪ And one was a young maid so sweet and so fair ♪ ♪ And the other was a soldier and a brave grenadier ♪ ♪ And they kissed so sweet and comforting ♪ ♪ As they clung to each other ♪ ♪ They went arm in arm along the road ♪ ♪ Like sister and brother ♪ ♪ They went arm in arm along the road ♪ ♪ Till they came to a stream ♪ ♪ And they both sat down together love ♪ ♪ To hear the nightingale sing ♪♪ Fuckin' hell! - She likes you, Wallace! - Keep it down! May I, sir? What's happened to His Lordship? Jago's taken him to look at the sentries. Then he's off to bed. - Doesn't drink. - Doesn't drink? I bet he likes it up the windward passage, that one. Bloody sodomite. Go and find his nibs, will you? Make sure he's happy. I'm off to Bedfordshire myself. Got a full day of arse-kissing tomorrow. Close the door. Come here. I can't do that, sir. It's alright. For your singin'. And this one.. ...I got in Hobart especially for you. You'll insult me if you don't take it. Sing a song. Just for me. ♪ As I went a-walkin'... ♪♪ Oh, not that one.

Every man in that room wanted you tonight. Sit on my lap. Sir, my letter of recommendation sir, it's due three months ago now. I'll send it when I'm ready. I'm meant to be in the care of my husband now, sir. It's the law. "It's the law," cried the thief. Didn't I rescue you from that hellhole of a prison? They warned me you'd be too much trouble. I took you on, anyway. You'd still be there if it weren't for me. I'm very grateful for that, sir. I let you marry the Irishman. Got you your own hut. Not good enough for Her Highness? I'm very grateful to you, sir. I even got you your own horse. No other convict in the district's got their own horse. Aidan worked for that horse for three years, sir. He paid for it himself. Ungrateful! Oh, here it comes. This is the part where she cries. I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I decide when you leave and when you stay. Stop cryin'. You're doing this deliberately, with the captain here. - No, sir, I'm not. - Yes, you are. You're doing it deliberately to get at me. I shouldn't have said nothing, sir. I'm so sorry. I'll leave you be. Come here! Please don't, sir! I need to get my baby. Please don't, no. No! Shut it. Fix your sleeve. Lieutenant. Captain. Out you go, miss. Your soldiers have been firing off their guns for no reason. They do that, sir, to ward off the blacks. They were rotten drunk and firing at the night sky, lieutenant. Finally. Some of us are living the high life while I take care of their screaming babies! You can take that dress off. You're a convict, not royalty. I'm taking it off now, damn you! I beg your pardon? You can start on the boilers before dawn. Aidan. Aidan! Can we go, love? And the little bird was so frightened. She thought she was going to die out there in the forest all alone. She called out in her sweet baby voice to see if her ma could hear her. Her voice was so pure it carried for miles through the trees. And suddenly out of nowhere.. ...her ma came flying down and scooped her up in her breast. And the little baby bird chirped with delight. She held on tight through the trees till they came to a beautiful place where she and her ma and da could all live happily together. The sun shone brightly and the air was clear. She was home. She was free. And what did he say? - He'll send it when he's ready. - Christ's sake! I'm demandin' it first thing in the mornin'. No, you can't order him to do anything. It won't work. He owes you your ticket, Clare. You've served your time and then some. - What's that mark? - What? - There's another on your neck. - I fell. Did he hurt you? I'll kill him if he hurt you! Stop it will you, you fool. I fell and hit my head on the stove. We're leavin' tonight. No. We can go somewhere no one'll find us. We have a few coins saved, we'll work it out. Aidan... if I got caught without a ticket I'd be sent straight back to that prison and I'd lose you both. I cannot do that. It'd kill me. He's heading up north soon... we'll have to follow. Do you want that? Do you want to be chained to him forever Clare? I'm meant to be looking after you now. I'll ask him myself tomorrow. I promise... I won't lose my temper. I'll be the nicest, most politest man... who ever lived. Alright? Alright, me missus? I love you Clare Carroll. You're my life. What are you made of? Come on. - I can't, sergeant. - Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Don't waste it, son. Salutations, lieutenant. You've done well. Not long now, we'll be calling you captain. What a bloody rigmarole. Won't be bendin' over for the likes of him when I'm captain. What? Give me a slice, sir! I'm sorry, sir. I'm so... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've had too much. You've had five soldiers flogged and in the clink already, sergeant. Do you want the rest of them in there? Get to bed, you tosspots! Don't drain the dregs. Just get! - Have you been drinking? - I'm just gonna talk to him. No! Let her go. - Beg yours? - I asked you nice this mornin'. Now I'm tellin' you. Let her go. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Watch your mouth. Well, let him speak. She's been askin' for three months. Every week you say you're gonna send the letter and every week you don't. Why won't you let her go? Aidan, please. Aidan. She's paid her dues and so have I. Is that right? She's my wife. And she's my property so I'll do what I want with her. Please, love. Just walk away now. No! In your office, lieutenant. What the hell were you thinking, fightin' an officer? Do you wanna ruin us? He's a troublemaker, sir, he and his wife. And what is she to you? Nothin', captain. Do you think I'm an idiot? No. The lieutenant governor finds moral indiscretion in his officers abhorrent. I agree. I don't tolerate any indiscretions. I've spent enough time here now. Noted your conduct and that of your soldiers. I'm afraid I can't recommend you for the captaincy up north. But I was told by the lieutenant colonel himself that he would put me forward to Major Bexley. Pending my recommendation. And I'm afraid I can't recommend you. Sir, I took on this post with the promise it would be one year. Three years later, I'm still here. I've been handed the sorriest band of soldiers that ever sullied the British Army and still I've had consistent results. I've civilized the land got rid of the blacks, made it safe... No one owes you anything, lieutenant! There is no officer in this colony who's put in more work than me, no one who knows it better. If an officer can't even control the convict detritus that surrounds him how on earth could he command a bigger post up north? I've a long trip back. I'll travel north to Launceston, see Major Bexley meself and apply for the position in person. If you insist. The post will be filled in four to five days, I'd say. Four to five days? Well, no other officer knows the colony better than you. Why don't you take your nag and ride up? It's nigh on impossible to get a horse up that way from here. Then take some men and walk it. Fuck! Fuck! We're headed up north to Launceston first thing through the interior. What? Isn't that dangerous? Yes, it's fucking dangerous, you fat-headed lobcock! But we're not ready yet, sir. I haven't handed things over to the corporal. We don't have any supplies, no black tracker. Then get us ready, Ruse. Do something useful for once. Drink up. We're paying a visit. I don't have a good feeling about this. What else? I lose my ticket, go back to the pen, and you're left alone with him? I'd rather us face the wild, take our chances. It's freezing for her out there. You remember how to pack this? Where will we go? Doesn't matter. Away from here. Let me feed her first. She's starving. Alright, quickly. Shh, shh. Shh. Going somewhere? We don't want no trouble. That's just the way, isn't it? You don't want trouble, but sometimes trouble wants you. - We're very sorry. - Not you! Him. Apologize. I'm sorry. No! No! Aidan, no! What, are you gonna shoot me now, you Irish cunt? You're nothing but the shit on my shoe. He's drunk, sir. He's very sorry for what he did. We both are. She's a beauty, your wife. I've enjoyed her greatly. Did she not tell you? Oh, we've been fucking like mad since she pushed that brat out. She loves it too. Got the scratches on my back to prove it. Don't listen to him, love. She begged me for it. Says I'm the best she's ever had. Get your hands off her! You want to see how she likes it? No. Aidan! I'll fucking kill you! No! No! I'll fucking kill you! - I'll fucking kill you! - No! - No! - Please, stop! - No! - No! - Please! - Alright, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, please! - No! - No. No! No! No! You fuckin' snake! No! No! I'll kill you!!! I'll kill you!!! Help me! You've wanted to try it. So try it. No! No! My baby! No! No! No! No! Shut it up. - No! - Shh, shh, shh. She won't shut up. Hey. - Shh, shh. - My baby! - Be quiet, be quiet. - Shut it up, will ya? - No! - Shh. Hey, be quiet. No! Please, please, be quiet. - No! No! My baby! - Shut up, please. Shut up! She won't shut up. Please, please, be quiet! - Shut it up or I will! - No! No! No! - Will you shut it up? - Please, shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Do it now! - No! You ruined it, Jago, you dolt. We'll have to finish it. What do you mean? Her, it. No. I... I can't. What are you made of? Finish it. Finish it! No! What's wrong, love? Oh, no, no! Oh, dear. You were meant to be here at sunup. Where is he? What have you done to the babe? Where is the lieutenant? Where is he? He left at dawn with the sergeant and the young ensign. To go where? - I don't have to tell... - To go where? To Launceston. To take up that new post, he said. They were goin' overland. Clare, wait! Did your husband do this? No, damn you, I told you! Watch your mouth. My husband is lying dead in a shack murdered by your officers. You want me to take the word of a woman convict over that of an officer? This is my word. This is my proof! Are you going to help me or not? I can write up a report, send it to Hobart. Go to hell! Don't go in there, Luddy. You don't need to see. You coming with me? I'm going after them. I've only just got me ticket meself. They'll put me back where I come from away from Luddy. I can't. Aidan would have died for you. Are you gonna leave him in a cold, dark grave while his murderers are free to do as they please? - He was my friend, too, Clare. - Clare.. - And we loved the little one. - Please. I want you to bury them under that tree. Put her in his arms so she's safe. Clare, what are you doing? Say a prayer. Bless them for me. - Clare, you can't just.. - Please, Clare. Clare, wait! - Don't go, love. - Stop! Stop! Whoa, whoa. Whoa. What in Christ's name are you doing? You don't even know where you're going! - I'll follow the paths. - What are you talking about? It's murderous out there. You'll die in a day! Should I stay home and do needlework? It's a fucking wilderness. At least take a guide, for God's sake. There's a guide that I work with. He's smart and knows the land. Those black ones, they know the way... I'm not traveling with a black. End up in a pot of someone's dinner. What are you trying to do to me? Clare, please. I can't let you go out there on your own. I couldn't live with meself. Boy! Fuck off! Billy. Billy! I've got a job for ya. Them soldiers come here already. I told them to bugger off. Uncle Charlie go with them instead. I'm not helping you white bastards no more. - You never pay. - The job's for me. I'm not workin' for no bloody white woman. I'll give you two shilling. One now and one when you get me to the soldiers that came by this morning. You don't have two shillin'. I'll cash this jewelry for the rest. If you kill me before the job's done you won't find anyone who'll take these for coin. So don't even think about it. I seen you.. ...at the boss bastard's house. - Where's your baby? - I don't have no baby. - What happened to your face? - Do you want the job or not? My husband's traveling with those men. You get me to my husband, then take us both to Launceston. Alone, no soldiers. I don't want no trouble. - For God's sake, boy. - Wait, wait. You give me one shilling now, we go tomorrow. You take me now or I'll find someone who will. You're not taking that horse with you. Too slow. - She's coming with us. - Then I'm taking the dogs. No dogs! Bloody dangerous riding with that. - Blow your head off. - You need to move. Move, boy! Wait, will ya? Wait! Go the wrong way, if you want. Them soldiers went this way. - What's with that face, ensign? - Sorry, lieutenant? You've been looking like a scared little girl all day. - Drop it. - Yes, sir. Move, ya cunts! Good choice, Ruse. A skeleton, a simpleton and a midget. - Well done. - I had no choice, sir. All the other convicts are off finishing the bridge. - We'd be faster without 'em. - All respect, sir. I can shine your boots, make a fire, fetch your water and run faster and work harder than them old farts. It appears the midget has some balls, lieutenant. There they go! Did you see? - That's my black. - What do you mean yours? He's my guide, you fool! Are you soft in the head? You're traveling alone with that? I've lost him now, thanks to you. Them savages lit that fire. They killed our sheep. They would have killed the wife and young'uns, too if we didn't come home early. Oh. Are you mad, woman? You cannot go out there on your own! There's a war on, you know. Aye, well, your funeral! Jesus Christ Almighty! Don't sneak up on me like that. What you gonna do? Shoot me or hang me? Our people cleared that land so we could hunt, get food. Be quiet, boy. Then you white devils come put sheeps on it. Told us to get off our land. Now we got no food. You kill us. I heard enough. Damn you. You get what you deserve. Where's the food? I'm starvin'. It must have fallen off. - What are you doing? - I'm getting us food. What? Stealin' it? - Boy! - Yes, I'm stealin' it. You go anywhere near that house and I'll leave you here. How are we gonna eat? Maybe we can eat that bloody horse. Why are you black, boy? You sick? Leave him be, sergeant. Charlie's a good boy. Aren't you, Charlie? Three more days till we're up north. Watch out. He'll get you in your sleep. They eat little ones like you. Ah! Leave him alone. He's just a boy. Says he, the great protector of children. What'd you say? Just makin' light, sir. Just makin' light. What's wrong, ensign? Just thinkin' of what happened, sir. What we did. What? Some Irish convict scum trying to kill an officer. He went for me with his musket. The world will thank us for it. The girl didn't die, sir. - I'm sure of it. - So? Even if she didn't, who's gonna do anything about it? For all anyone knows her husband killed the baby in a rage. Then he set upon her, so she shot him. Don't worry yourself, lad. We could hang for it, sir. This is the last time you'll mention it, ensign to anyone. You were never there. You don't know what happened. And when I look at your stupid face from this point on I wanna see a permanent fucking smile. Alright? Look on the bright side, sir. Two months in Van Diemen's Land and you're already a baby killer. Hey. Hey! Hey! If either of you do anything to jeopardize this post for me I swear I'll leave you in the fucking bush to rot! Shut it up or I will! Come on, sweetheart. That's the way. They went that way, five of them. - Five? - And a little one. A kid. Plus Uncle Charlie, them seven. They go fast. Hardly no stop. How long till we reach them? Maybe catch 'em up tomorrow. I don't know. Well, can't we go a quicker way? That way quicker way, catch 'em up today. But much more harder. More bush, more.. Get them off! Ah, get them off! That's pipina. They love you, them ones. - Don't touch me. - Help me! Ah, they're big and fat. They're full of themselves. Boy? Boy? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Where are you goin'? - My husband's traveling ahead. There's only army men through here. Your husband a soldier, is he? I need to get to my husband. So you said. Where's your papers? I'm a free married woman. What sort of a husband lets a woman travel out here on her own? Me and my mate, we're partial to a bit of Irish cunny. You stay here a while, there'll be a decent coin in it for ya. I wouldn't touch you if my life depended on it. Then show me your papers, you Irish cunt. When my husband finds out what you said.. Hey! Hey! Hey! Every time something bad happens you're nowhere to be found. I'm paying you to protect me! No, you're not. I'm showing you the way. You protect yourself. You're a bloody coward. I'm not a coward. Those ones who see a blackfella, they shoot a blackfella. Bit hard for a dead man to show you the fuckin' way. You take 'em, midget. I gotta piss. Koa! Come on Koa, come on. Catch up, quick. Look at you. Please, my baby. I've never seen one like you before. I'm not gonna hurt ya. No! Koa! Koa! No! Help! Koa! No! Help! Look what I found! I was takin' a piss and she was right there. What in the hell are you doing bringing one here? Where there's one, there's ten, sergeant. She was with a bunch of dead ones. She was just cryin' like this. I swear they were all dead. This was the only live one. I just wanna try one, sir. Just once. - No. - You've swived them before. - Why can't I? - Don't be disgusting. Pack up! Get rid of her. I done plenty of things for you, sir. This is the least you could do for me. I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I was just.. You can swive her first, sir. I don't mind. She's a beauty. Look at her, sir. This was the only live one. Please let me go. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. My baby! He's on his own! Shh, shh, shh. My baby boy! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Tie her up to the cart. Any problems, that's the end of it. Let me go! No! Let me go, you devil! Shut it! - They close. - How close? Get to 'em today if the river not too high. Hear that river? - Close. - Please can we hurry? Please. What are you doing? River too high. Get to 'em another day. - You said we would make it. - I'm not the boss. - River the boss. - Jesus Mary! What are you doing? We're not going across. - We're going across. - No. River too high, too fast. No! Come on, Becky. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hey. We need to eat. Hey! You fuckin' little black devil! Come back here! Come here! Plenty of food out here I could get. But I need time. I can make spear to hunt. Why don't you go and do it now then? Stop whinging about it. You bloody white people. Take me from my family. Say, "You'll be like white boy now. "You don't hunt. Don't do ceremony. That's bad way. You do it whitefella way." Whitefella way is shit way. - Now I got nothing. - Poor you. No. Not poor me. Bastard England. You think you're the only one with problems? I've looked after meself since I was a kid. Never knew me father. Me mother worked herself to an early grave. I lived on the streets, stole what I could to survive. And now I'm here at the arse end of the world with you. Welcome to the world, boy. Full of misery from top to bottom. I'm not your boy. I'm mangana, the blackbird. I'm Letteremairrener man. I'm not "God Save The King" like them white bastards sing. I'm..

Say, "You be like white boy now." I don't never wanna be like white boy. Not now, not ever. That big boss you following, he's the worst one. He make me take him to blackfella then he shoot the blackfella. I'm not working for no bloody whitefella no more. I'm gonna go up north. I'm gonna find my mother, my aunties. Go back home to my country so you can't hurt me no more. What do you mean me? I didn't hurt your family. I didn't do anything. You England. I'm not England.

You're not lookin' for your husband, are ya? You don't have a baby no more. Alright? This way. Up there? Not here? Too many blackfella that way. More fight, get killed. No good. This looks steep. Blackfella chasing you now 'cause you killed that woman. Blackfella not go up mountain way. Safer way. Quick way too. Bad spirits here. Very bad. - Quickly. - Oi. Stop! Stop! Stop! Oi!
