Yes, I am Professor Pohland The well known neurologist In whose clinic, you Dr Mabuse,die Now that you have vanished from the world I must loyally fulfil your wishes I will spread panic and chaos everywhere I'll become Dr Mabuse Well, is everything ready ? Oh,Inspector Vulpius I could only save bits of the will It'll take months to get them legible The testament of Dr Mabuse Yes,thats all we've got left, the rest disappeared, And our friend Mabuse was killed It's very difficult to believe Mabuse is really dead Not for me it isn't, What?s left of him is there Actually Doctor,I wanted to study the papers today, if you don't mind I'm afraid they haven't been cleared You must have photocopies made of them You protect Mabuse?s testament as the French do the Mona Lisa Well, they?re both masterpieces in there own way Goodnight Doctor - Goodnight Inspector What happened ? Are you alright? Damn it, that?s a break, once more I come up smelling of roses Yes, somebody up there loves you The testament was full of indications of future crimes All the details worked out I guess Mabuse didn't want it to be decoded You really believe he's still alive in some form? That?s mere superstition Maybe..... In Mabuse?s case, nothing can be ruled out. The trains off the track !! Take these blasted things off will you Everything will be alright, nothings going to prevent me from getting you to jail on time You're wrong, where?s the key ? This man is going with us Who are you ? - I can't tell you that now, The main thing is to get you out Slice of cake ? or a cookie ? I'm not hungry I'd prefer it if you told me where we are going But Cockstone,we're old buddies In the war,remember ? In the war? Don't you recall our great days together ? We were detained for investigation You can't be Hyliard... Ernest Hyliard? The voice is familiar,but you don't look like him. I don't,the face is quite new, marvellous job by a famous plastic surgeon He's English,on the boss's payroll Is the boss himself an Englishman ? Nobodies been told, but he definitely prefers British employees. Like you and me, he got me out of trouble as well. Who is your mysterious boss ? Yours too - Mine ? Dr Mabuse Well, we?ve got the man you wanted And the train ? - Derailed And the guard ? - Dead Good Leave us alone George Cockstone,convicted of theft,embezeling Deprived of his civil rights, for illegal surgery And causing a patients death through negligence Five years in prison I have use for men like you Thanks for your confidence And especially because you're English You're essential to my plans When operations are completed, I will move my headquarters over there Here is your task It concerns the invention of Professor Lawrence This is the new topography of the human brain All the nerve centres are clearly marked Sight, hearing as well as sensation The motor impulses, and the speaking faculty And naturally, all other specialised functions You know the brain is like a battery with twenty watts of electric energy the separate centres act as batteries and the fuel is a powerful mixture of glucose and oxygen These send the electric impulses through the whole nervous system acting like a vast telephone switchboard This is all very interesting, but not new Of course it is'nt, but its the basis of a discovery which is entirely new. Professor Lawrence has been working on a method to transform the switchboard of the human brain into an equally powerful radio station. A kind of telepathy I gather ? Allowing thoughts and willpower to be transferred It means the control of mankind, A power more effective than any atom bomb You want this power in your possession? At any price I must get hold of Professor Lawrence?s invention And your objective as a doctor, is to worm your way into his confidence In my situation that?s impossible My diplomas been withdrawn My photo appears in a thousand post offices You will be provided with a new diploma And a new name, and a new face - By your surgeon ? Yes, you will get an honest face from him You will acquire confidence and respect You'll re-appear as private Judo Ranke the intimate collaborator of Professor Lawrence Even a surgeon can be indiscreet He's smarter than that He's already operated on so many faces he could only incriminate himself Former assistant surgeon of the British army of occupation Dishonourably discharged from the services for irregular conduct He took refuge in Germany Where he illegally practiced electro shock therapy, and when the patient died, he drew a penalty of five years And while they were taking him to prison, he killed the guard But Kloppe, he didn't have any sort of weapon, no bullets were missing from the guards pistol No, someone else must have done it. Several might have.. Here?s a letter from our British Correspondent about cockstone. He suggests we contact Major Bill Tern who handled the case Tomorrow morning please ask Scotland Yard for his phone number Yes Blackie, I hear it,I can hear it Who could be calling so early in the day? Hello... No, I?m not Major Tern, I?m his mother The Major cannot be disturbed now The are two good reasons today is Sunday, and he's on his vacation Oh...you're phoning from Hamburg, well I'm sorry, there is nothing urgent enough to disturb Major Tern on his vacation Morning Mother... - Ahh...Bill You got up early to help me in the garden No, I happened to hear the phone You always happen to hear the phone That was Mrs Carter for a recipe - Mama... Oh you win, I didn't want to wake you you growing boys need sleep I'll tell you a big secret, I?m not a boy anymore That?s what you think - Oh,those black cigars... Only three a day, between them I have to get along with a pipe And read detective stories hmm ? I'm so often alone Since you've grown up, the vegetable garden and mystery stories are my only real pastime Tobacco , cabbages and murder That?s all that?s left for me, once you pack up and leave me, Which you do more and more often Don't change the subject mama, who just phoned ? An inspector Vulpius from Hamburg And you just hang up without even asking if its urgent or not ? Well if its so urgent,he's sure to call back You see... You?re always right aren?t you Hello.. No,I'm not my mother,I'm Bill Tern Oh,Inspector Vulpius, what can I do for you? George Cockstone?.. we're old acquaintances Kidnapped from the train on the way to jail? Yes....yes I've got it, I'll be on the next plane The end of your vacation ? - How do you know that ? Sunday morning you receive two phone calls from Hamburg Both urgent It means its a question of international importance And what is a question of international importance ? Espionage sabotage and so forth Your logic is deadly mother You're the one that should have been contacted by Scotland Yard And I should have stayed in bed. I must get dressed What about your malaria shot ? I'm only going to Germany Well be careful of those German girls dear Before you can move a muscle, they?ve got you hooked Hello Kloppe - Hello Inspector My closest collaborator, Major Tern Hello - First get the photo of Cockstone Sit down - Thanks Yes,that is George Cockstone An army surgeon who stole electronic materials And was dishonourably discharged from the services That?s a very mild sort of punishment isn't it? I recommended leniency because I believed his basic motive was science Like the doctors who stole corpses in order to study anatomy This Cockstone is no scientific martyr Just a criminal with scientific training Yes,that was my mistake Well it happens, that a train has been derailed recently with the purpose of freeing him It seems to indicate that a powerful organisation is involved Exactly what my mother deduced Since our first experiments have been such a success I've been wondering how a man would react The chief difficulty of course, is that no one would allow Electrodes to be introduced into the nerve centres of his brain That will no longer be necessary You mean the apparatus, you refuse to reveal even to your trusted assistant Professor ?? I didn?t wish to show it to you before it had been perfected Is it perfected ? An invention,as you well know, is never really perfect But I'm ready now to share, the fruits of my investigation As a reward for your faithful assisstance, I've decided you shall be our first subject Professor this is a great honour for me but.. The experiment is quite harmless I have developed a machine, that projects my wishes into the nerve centres of your brain and at the same moment awakens in you a strong impulse, to accept and obey any suggestions so produced That makes me completely subservient to your will Professor To a good will my friend, one must stress the good of course In the wrong hands, any invention can be dangerous What am I to do ? - Do you play the violin ? No,never been near one in fact Well then,do me a favour and try it, there's my instrument behind you. It will work very well you?re a very handsome figure of a violinist Don't worry,I'll make a violinist of you if it kills me I played the violin Not you, me,my friend Transmitting the impulses through your brain to your fingers And this was all due to this machine of yours? That?s right my friend I see in this the most profound cause for alarm my dear Professor Lawrence If this invention should fall into unscrupulous hands the consequences... Fortunately I can set your mind at rest in this respect my English colleague Masterson has recently completed a machine to counter-act its effect We must have proof that the thing functions Playing the violin isn?t enough what we must discover is whether with this machine A man could be made to commit a crime The only proof would be to try it Can you get at the apparatus without the Professor noticing anything ? I have another key to the laboratory How large is the device ? - Roughly the size of a book For a start,just camouflage the device, perhaps in a camera, to hide it If the first test works, we look for something better What is the test going to be ? Inspire someone to murder the Professor It would be easier if I did it - It wouldn?t prove a thing We must choose a man for whom murder is unimaginable Just an ordinary man Here comes the postman Honest jovial,years of work, soon to be rewarded with a pension Father of a family of six children, baritone in the men?s choir It would seem unbelievable, that such an upright citizen could commit murder Unbelievable. Good morning Mr.Ranke And a very good morning to you sir You've something for me ? No,only a registered letter for the Professor You'll find him down in the lab - Alright,thank you Yes,who is it ? - Postman Come in I have a registered letter for you Professor Put it over there on the table Sign here Professor, if you don?t mind My condolences Dr.Ranke. It must be a terrible blow to you Yes,the Professor was like a father to me Its quite beyond me how such a murder could ever have been committed The Professor had no enemies, he was goodness itself When was the corpse discovered ? Shortly before nine, the time I usually come to the laboratory And what was the last project that occupied him ? Electronics is a vast subject We collaborated on a number of experiments, but some he classified as secret Did he leave unfinished work ? He named me to complete his scientific experiments Unfortunately its difficult to follow his notes I foresee an extended period of research Yes yes,of course I wont be needing you for the time being If anything happens then I may have to call Thank you,thank you I checked carefully Inspector, name and return address proved to be false Have a seat please Mr Schroeder you say you were the one who delivered, this registered letter to the Professor yesterday Yes sir When was that ? I always come about nine, it was about nine, I came You may have been the last person to see the Professor alive That?s right Inspector Because when he was signing, he was still alive And then.. - What then ? Then I killed him I beg your pardon ? There was a pestle on the table Something made me grab it... I hit him with it As hard as I could Mr Schroeder,do you know what you're saying ? Yes,I cant believe it myself But that?s the way it happened Good morning mother - Good morning Bill You'll have to get a hookah to go with that turban What were you doing yesterday evening ? You came home late I was up waiting for you and heard, And you weren?t alone Oh , one of our agents had to make a report for headquarters In the middle of the night ? Yes, that?s what makes it exciting Well, the next time he comes to hand in his report he can skip the French perfume, and the high heels as well He should remember not to leave his lace handkerchief around And to lower his voice when he whispers quietly unless you want your mother to know So, now of course you're going to ask me, if there is anything in the news that?s interesting And I?ll reply, yes Crazy postman kills well known Professor in Hamburg And it was your friend Vulpius who broke the case He's a very competent fellow, he's only failed once that I know of In the case of Cockstone, you remember the army doctor, who kept top priority electronic materials for his own use That is a marvellous coincidence Cockstone an electronics crook and the murdered Professor an electronics genius There must be some connection Oh please mother,dont start pestering me with your ideas You cant build a theory on the basis of the word electronic And especially not these days when everything is electronic It doesn't mean anything to use the word electronic Whenever an agent disappears or a scientist defects electronics is behind it Deep sea diving,anti aircraft defence, satellite control, its all electronic It's nonsense to search for an explanation just on that basis It's stupid, totally absurd But for all that, you could be right The plane to Hamburg leaves in an hour Excuse me Major, but the idea that Cockstone, had any to do with the murder of Professor Lawrence I know there?s not the slightest evidence to base it on Merely instinct, Mothers instinct, as it happens Oh really, your mother is being helpful - She?s full of ideas I don?t object to instinct Major, but its proved beyond any doubt that the postman is the murderer However, he acted under compulsion and with no motive what so ever Anybody around who we could ask for more detailed information ? Just Doctor Ranke, the Professors assistant But I?ve already questioned him If its alright, I?d very much like to speak to him Of course, he?s certainly at the lab now Shall we pay him a visit ? Over here... Doctor Ranke, he?s dead Has the entire lab been demolished? The important instruments were removed before the explosion took place We can take them to England disguised as meteorological equipment I?d love to see their faces, they believe you've been killed So much the better They'll check the body, and find Cockstone's fake identification Major I must congratulate you Ranke and Cockstone were one and the same Or are, one and the same, I?m not at all sure this is Cockstone Fingers are burned, so prints are impossible The whole face is burned to a crisp Yes, but the measurements check Doctor, let me see the autopsy report I haven?t dictated it yet Does he still have his appendix ? - Yes Cockstone's was removed in 1948 Really ? - Yes Then who is it ? Perhaps his stomach will give us a clue What did his last meal consist of? - It was Chinese food Do you know this man ? Do you work in a Chinese restaurant ? - Yes, but I?m Italian Do you recognise this man ? Yes,thats..... - Who ? Doctor Wakeman You can identify him in spite of his charred face? His foot was scarred I remember, we were very good friends What sort of Doctor was he? An English Doctor, he helped me a great deal I see...... - Not the way you mean He remodelled my nose for me, and charged nothing So he was a plastic surgeon ? Now I know why George Cockstone was never found, he has a new face I think you over rate Cockstone he?s simply a henchman I recognise the hand of a master The guards are posted Disguised as forest rangers, farm hands and domestic servants Our greatest advantage is England?s unwritten law My house is my castle In here we can work on the equipment in peace And prolong its effectiveness We must ensure it's effective, at least 24 hours or more Hormones produced during sleep tend to counter act the effect Professor Lawrence was just about to develop a new process, to offset this action We must discover this formula, wherever it is Until then, we must renew our commands to our men every morning While our equipment is in its present state And what if our one machine fails us ? We must have more than one Which means we'll need jewels of an identical chemical consistency This evening, there?s a gala presentation at the opera house To be attended by everyone of importance in the realm Princess Diana and the Duke of Rampart, her fianc? will be present On such occasions the Princess wears her famous necklace Very good In one minute the Duke will arrive And if he doesn't come ? His orders were, at midnight there will be two men waiting for you under the lamp post on the left The parcel containing the gems, is to be given to them If this succeeds, England will never forgive him Here comes the car Help...help gorilla !! Halt !! Hands up, I?ll shoot if you take one more step Bill... You wicked mother, you?re not going to kill your own son are you ? Where did you get a revolver anyway ? I have to say it doesn't exsist, but I?ll have to get one, one of these days There's no place like home Where are you going now ? I wish I knew But when the secret service comes for me at midnight, it must be urgent I hope its not because of Princess Diana - Why Diana ? Well I watched the gala on television Princess Diana was attending and a remarkable idea came to me Remarkable ? Yes, you see Princess Diana came with her fianc? but went home all alone It happens all the time Yes but I noticed something else When she arrived she had her ermine cape over her shoulders And when she left she had it drawn up close around her neck Now mother they're waiting for me, goodnight I'm sorry to wake you up Bill - what?s the matter now ? This case is extremely delicate - About Princess Diana ? Yes,she's involved, but how do you know about it ? No more than four people know the situation You forget my mother Sir, Commisioner You know Major Tern, this is Mr Rank Have a seat please Yes, gentlemen I came here expressly to tell you a story About an hour ago I was awakened by the Duke of Rampart White as a sheet he stands at my bed and says Commisioner I must confess to you, I answered, wrong address, you should wake up the Archbishop of Canterbury I must tell you he said I?m the one who made off with the Princess Diana?s jewels I received an order That I was to deliver them to two strangers at midnight Where did the order come from ? That, he didn't know But he felt a force that he was unable to resist in any way Another outside force like the postman in Hamburg A postman ? The murder of Professor Lawrence They've agreed its a case of insanity I recommend an identical judgement in the Dukes case Yes,thats the only cause possible I know you'll take me for an idiot, but if anyone can help us now, its Professor Masterson The physicist? Yes, the famous electronics specialist I fear we my accept the rather unnerving hypothesis that we're up against an unprecedented new force A new force that we must deal with Well I wont argue with a maniac, drive over and see Masterson Where does he live ? - in Doncaster As an old neighbour, I took the liberty of coming in the back way You must be Nancy, Nancy Masterson You know me ? The last time I saw you, you were so high Yes, those were my good days I couldn?t have made very much of an impression I guess I?m Bill Tern I was more taken in with the uniform Forgive me, you want to speak to my father ? Yes, I have an appointment with him for 10 o' clock I?m afraid you're wrong I cant be,did'nt he tell you he was waiting for somebody to come ? A photographer - photographer ? Father said that he didn?t wish to be disturbed But that doesn't apply at all to me Professor Masterson its Bill Tern Open the door Father... Hello is anyone here ? Did you call Professor ? - Come here quickly For heavens sake, what?s happened ? The Professor is dead Suicide ? - I don't believe it's suicide But he died by his own hand didn?t he ? The Duke of Rampart stole with his own hand too And I?m sure he?s no thief He too acted under powerful outside forces And so did the Professor Men like him don?t act this way Father had so many plans for the future For supper the Professor asked me to cook some kidney A man doesn't give orders like that if he?s going to kill himself I'd like to ask you a few questions - Me? Yes, shall we go in the other room Nancy, do you want to help me ? If I can In addition to the photographer who else was here ? Only the photographer Can you describe him to me ? He was wearing sunglasses, had a straw hat And a slender build Did you notice anything else of interest ? Photographers are usually friendly and easy going He was rather distant and curt Are you alone ? - Yes Professor Masterson had to be killed unfortunately Why ? Our secret weapon failed with him What ? These, were among his things It must be the counter apparatus Professor Lawrence talked about Nancy we?ve got things to do in the lab, I'll want your help I have to speak to you after your through Miss Masterson Thank god my mother didn?t live to go through this She?s pretty sharp Even in mourning she lets you know there?s no mother in law You old cynic If an internationally famous Professor, commits suicide, there must be a reason for it I knew Masterson We were old neighbours and close friends He?d have been likely to discuss his main problems with me suicide is highly improbable Judgement based, on insufficient evidence Besides, The Duke, I?m sure he had no motive for stealing those jewels And the postman in Hamburg had no reason to kill Professor Lawrence It was an outside force If we accept your deductions, Bill If we assume that something could suspend the will of the Professor And cause a despotic intrusion of an alien will, then we?re up against a power that can ruin us all We must go back over the whole affair I?m absolutely sure there are valuable clues in the case of the postman which can lead us to the solution If my theory is correct, the crimes must have at least one conspicuous feature in common Yes, but what ? Vulpius must come over here You know I purposely arranged a private meeting between us The affair is highly confidential I know of the affair, and I?ve produced the solution You have solved the case ? - Mother solves all my cases Here?s my guess There exists an outside compulsion a mysterious influence so we're forced to assume, a hypnotising machine So fantastic, its almost plausible Today they have an apparatus for everything Cigarette butt in your mouth, that?s how you detect a career detective Its a great weakness of mine - Come Blackie let?s leave the solution to the brains Mother like to shoot blindly, but she scores quite often Now back to our case Listen Vulpius,I?m positive that the vital factor in this affair Must be connected with that murder in Hamburg Any new information about it ? When I let there wasn?t a thing, nothing in all the police reports so far The postmans story hasn?t helped us a single bit He talks about the kids he saw playing on the football field All about the dog that tried to bite a woman Even a man taking a photograph - photographer? well yes, a tourist was there taking souvenir pictures Just like the picture of Masterson someone took before he killed himself And the Duke of Rampart drove past a group of photographers Before he stole the princesses necklace But my dear major.. Each time photography was involved Well it could very well be a coincidence three times in a row,persistant coincidence No, we must ask ourselves, is it possible by means of an apparatus, to control the will of another person I cant imagine such a machine, unless its the hypnotising machine your mother talked about Still today we have atom bombs, and fly at the speed of sound, everything is possible We're ready with the second device We must avoid too many experiments to test the efficiency of the apperatus Somehow we have to work out a definitive experiment to make Have you any ideas ? - Yes What for instance ? We must get a murderer to commit suicide Have you thought about what you just said ? Then the device is at your complete disposal, to carry out any experiments you so wish I'lll be needing it tomorrow at 4 am If this model works, then our power will know no bounds A hangman who himself,is hanged This last test shows, no defence can withstand our new weapon Good day - Do you want something ? I'm a photographer for new review on our animal friends Will you permit me to photograph your dog ? Hear that blackie ? Make us a friendly face What about a human interest picture with his mistress ? Would you be so kind as to tell me, how to get to Marble Arch please ? Thats very easy, walk down this street, It's just past the post office on the left Thank you You have your orders ? Yes sir - Here,you better take this You are familiar with it ? Yes, its a hand grenade - Good Well inspector I'm sorry you have to leave us I'm just a plain policeman, mysterious stuff like this, is a delicacy for me My daily bread is burglary, confidence tricks... and a few cozy robberies and murders The airport James - Yes Sir Halt ! Where are you going james ? This is not the way to the airport Following my orders Head over to the airport Those aren't my orders From who ? From my new boss, sir I'm your boss James Sorry sir, I have orders to bring you to my new boss Take me to the airport Drop your weapons on the floor I have a hand grenade The three of us will be blown to pieces I believe him Whoever forced the hangman to kill himself, could achieve this too You better do what he says Drop your weapons on the floor We cant avoid admitting that Princess Diana has been kidnapped As well as Joe Rank, and the police commisioner Not to speak of our ally from Hamburg, Inspector Vulpius You have any clues ? Only that photographer seen in Doncaster forest A helicopter has been combing the area ever since A foresters home with farm buildings A good spot for a landing, we can make some enquiries Have you understood the order ? - Yes Sir That's good, a helicopter with 2 pilots Now we'll have to put our pilot friends on the wrong track Who do you recieve your orders from ? - Major Bill Tern Oh, a very good friend of mine, these many years Kindly walk back to your plane, and broadcast him the following message He reports every half hour Flight 8.17 ready to report 3 B ready for report Landed at former forest rangers, 80 miles from london Full search of premises, found nothing but storage sheds and chicken coops 3 farm hands declare wanted cars are headed towards Glenmore We proceed to Scotland : Over - Received you clearly They're going to Scotland The Scottish highlands are a probable destination I've summoned you all here, for the express purpose of assisting me to halt the decay of the country And to bring back, the glory of the empire And to bring new leadership If England expects that of me, I'm ready to serve And you, Joe Rank ? - I am too sir You Inspector Vulpius, will have a special task I'm at your command I'm afraid you have no choice Inspector Vulpius When we take over the government Everyone will have to co-operate We stand on the threshold of a new era for England representitives of the old order, are to be promptly and systematically eliminated But Bill, Dr Mabuse can't be this mastermind You're really quite mad We british can never recognise facts unless we are really compelled to Every day people vanish, in broad daylight Here is a list of them Each one a top Rankeing authority in his special branch of science Gas !! Tern .. - It's Nancy Masterson Hello Nancy, what can i do for you ? Major Tern, I must tell you something I'm so afraid - Where are you ? I ran away from my home And I'm in a little hotel called Hotel Marigold Room number 26 - Good, I'll come right over Who is it ? - Bill Tern Whats the matter ? Ann tried to murder me - your housekeeper ? She was my nanny and my friend I still cant believe any of it First of all,just try to calm down How did you happen to choose this hotel ? I ran away from my place into the street This was the first hotel I saw, And I walked in without thinking Thats about it You're the first person I thought of to ask for help Major Tern Call me Bill Please help me Bill - Of course But first of all,you'll have to remain right here I'll return in a little while And when will that be ? - As quickly as I can Don't open to anybody but me Who are you, what do you want ? Why so unfriendly ? You're more beautiful when you're smiling Thank you What's wrong with you blackie ? You getting nervous ? Mother,you're still up ? - I waited up for you With a revolver ? - Quite right You bad boy, have you lost your wits ? why did you do that to me ? Tell me mother Do you feel an irresistable and driving force ? Absolutely I feel an irresistable and driving force, to give you a few good whacks on your bottom Is it possible the apparatus failed to work on you ? What are you talking about ? Did a photographer visit you ? Don't worry about your tough old mother You're a plucky old bird alright, you're stronger than any apparatus Do you really believe this apparatus, could force a mother to kill her own son ? That, and more Could it be Mabuse do you think ? Vulpius and you share the same fixed idea Won't you please try to remember mother, Mabuse is dead any theory that holds otherwise is completely absurd and ridiculous But what the devil, you could be right You called me , Sir ? To record this text on tape, We will pass it on to the police This is police commisioner Robert Allingham I have an important message for all of you The power which I represent possesses a secret weapon, of unlimited possiblities, and it delivers the following ultimatum Immediate abdication of the present government And unqualified obediance to the new one The lawfulness of which has been recognised by her Majesty Princess Diana Intersection point, 5 miles west street in precinct A1 Now we've got him You have the priviledge of being chosen by the new goverment The new government ? I'm not sure I understand You're not being asked to understand, just carry out orders In a moment, Princess Diana will be our guest However any hesitation in regard to our authority, might force us to make her our prisoner Loyal officers... Tern here,they've smashed one of our radio cars to pieces Determine its position at once. Out Shall I wait ? - No thank you Help,help me Bill Bill help, help me Joe Rank... Hello Bill, get in here Any choice with that revolver ? Come in Major,it would be unhealthy to turn him down What's happened to Nancy Masterson ? She's safe and sound, all we needed was her voice Would you shut that damn thing off... You seem agitated Come on my friend, you might as well just relax Am I under special classification to rate getting kidnapped in style? You're not being kidnapped, you're going to be killed I'm so happy to know that You don't seem worried... I'm very worried But we're trained never to show fear We'll be there soon Inspector Vulpius will handle the rest Why is it you ? Our new boss finds it more amusing When a collegue does it Collegue .... - Any objections ? Get out Bill If the apparatus is that powerful.. - A car's coming !! Inspector Vulpius quick, get under the bridge Are you going to carry out your order ? It's a double order, first I kill you then me The corpses will be washed down by the river So, we going to die together Neither of us will die Then it failed to work with you ? - Failed completely I just pretended so as to learn as much as possible from them Rank was assigned to see we were dead Tea is served gentlemen No coffee,just some tea - Thats what I said And a cigarette,mine are all soaking wet - Yes my dear Major Thank you. I have no idea at all, why the damn thing didn't work on me You're not the only one - I beg your pardon ? I said, you aren't the only one - Yes yes, I know Mabuse is immune also but in his case there's a reason, he's wearing a counter device And what are you wearing ? - I beg your pardon I repeat, what are you wearing ? A blanket - I must arrest you Are you being funny ? - Arrest you You're all we've got as a counter weapon We must discover the cause of your immunity Yes ,I'm immune against chicken pox No,your immunity against the thing Look Major, I really dont understand you Would you mind speaking up ? my ear is full of water My hearing aid is drenched Hearing aid ? An electronic hearing aid, that must be it An electronic battery supply - A what supply ? Just a moment My mother doesn't answer Odd, I hope nothing's happened to her No...no Mother,mother whats wrong with you? Bill... Thank god You woke me up just in time I could feel the stranglers fingers on my neck You didn't answer when I telephoned, why was that ? He tried,but he couldn't fool me I let it ring at least seven times Are you having trouble with your hearing ? What's that you say ? Have you any difficulty with your hearing ? Haven't you ever heard anyone talk of a woman's vanity? A whole lifetime, and you never told me you wore a hearing aid Oh Bill..... I have better things to worry about than that You're a darling mother You've cleared up a big problem Let me have your hearing aid will you ? Yes,if you'll be careful with it That's our weapon against Dr Mabuse Look at this That's the same model I have, dear lady Thank you Inspector,I'm very well Inspector Rank, you'll be needing your official identification Take this down Plans for the hold up of the train Cockstone team reporting - Hyliard team reporting I repeat, I repeat the time is 0 300 and 8 seconds The mailtrain is 500 metres from you, It is hidden from you by the curve The engineer and fireman are not armed The money we need to overthrow the government, is located In the second car. There are 2 to 3 million pounds Inside this car are four men, also unarmed The train is being uncoupled behind the second car The engine is proceeding with the first two cars, to the point of rendezvous - got it Inspector Rank is the only one who is armed He is not participating in this action It is now 0 300 and 50 seconds The train is rounding the curve, and should be visible to you now You are to use the apparatus on the engineer and the fireman Is that understood ? Understood - Understood Take this.. Ok,uncouple Whats going on here ?
