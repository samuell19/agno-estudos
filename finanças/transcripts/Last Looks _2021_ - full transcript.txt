What's missing from this picture? We'll start with extraction, which is a fancy word for trashing the planet. What this looks like looks like is we chop down the trees, we blow up the mountains to get the metals inside and use up all the water, and we wipe out the animals. We are running out of resources. Now, I know this can be hard to hear, but it's the truth. So we've got to deal with it. In the past three decades alone, onethird of the planet's natural resource space has been consumed. Gone. We are cutting and lining and hauling and trashing the place so fast that we're undermining the planet's variability for people to live here. We have 5% of the world's population, but we're using 30% of the world's resources. If everybody consumed a US rate, we would need three of them. And you know what? We've only got one. Do you live in that? Seriously? Does your chicken have a name? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Where's all your stuff? Divested. Cut myself down to 100 things. What do you mean. A 100 thingsshirts. One thing bowls, one thing fork, sleeping bag. Chicken. And you kept that hat. Tell me you at least have a gun. Jesus. When's the last time you had anybody up here? Three years. You got any friends? Chicken. Wow. What the fuck is that. About the last of a sculptor? Sure, because this spoke to you, right? Some of that time we were supposedly broken up. I went into us at the art Museum on Wilshire. I was on a date. I ditched the guy. We went straight to your truck in the parking structure. It was right next to the Breyer target by the mammoth. Okay, first of all, this isn't a mammoth. It's an elephant. Second of all, you're saying I bought this property because I had a subconscious sexual memory prompted by this sculpture. Which you brought me straight to the minute I came to visit you uninvited. Look, I'm here on business. Alistair Pinch. The actor killed his wife. Look, maybe he killed her. Maybe he didn't. I don't think he even knows the guy's a blackout drunk. The network's got a lot riding on him. So they're paying for his lawyer. He did kill him. It means the money serious. They're looking to hire a Pi. This gig could jump into the majors if I could deliver the famous Charlie Waldo to work it with me. Come on. You know these Hollywood types. They always want to put a big name in it. Retired. I see that from the fourth, I'd be willing to go 80 20 yours. What would I even do with the money? Buy a nicer 100 things? Because then my life would be complete. Exactly. My dad was a long time ago. Lorena, you don't have to keep punishing yourself. You don't have to live like that. You don't have to live like that. Fuck. You expect me to apologize? Hey, I grew up. Poor for real porn. Not with solar panels. Come on, let me bring you back into the real world. Just for a few weeks. We'll have some laughs. I can't. All right? It was worth a shot. Can you have a hug? At least you ghosted me, Waldo. I ghosted everybody I know. Smell better than you look. Can't stay up here forever. No. Why not? Same reason you and I kept hooking back up. Unfinished business is a bitch. Things are not looking good for celebrated actor Alastair Pinch. He's under renewed scrutiny by the LAPD regarding the murder of his wife, Monica Pinch. Two weeks ago. Investigators say they are focusing their inquiries on the actor himself as the prime suspect. Jesus. Well, though, you know, you shouldn't do that. Lorraine Nasimento was out here a couple of days ago. Oh, yeah. I'd have to check my visitors log. Don't jerk me. She's been scoping you for the Pinch murder. Some pastors, at least are her worries. She say anything about Don Queue, the game show host, captain of industry. A recreational pharmaceutical industry. The girls on his payroll. That sounds like bullshit. That's not bullshit. You check out her ride. Where do you think she gets that kind of cheese? We're in a cop with four kids. Get the cheese for a vet. Drop this. Anyway. She took something belonged to Don Queue. Not exactly the healthiest lifestyle choice. Now, what I think is she came up here to leave it with you. Leave? What if you're smart? You will give it to me. I don't know what it is. I haven't. This is stuff wasting my time, man. The last thing she did on her computer was Google method ass pile. Last call on her cell was from idlewise. You mean last call? They're missing persons open. I don't know. That would require somebody gave a shit. What? This is, Lorena. You can leave a message. But if you want me to call you back, you better make it interesting. Hit them again. Whatever the problem is here today. Good motherfuckers. We want you to stay away up on this motherfucking mountain and stay away from out of Stair pinch it's right. If you don't, you'll get more visits from the Palisade. Possibly. Motherfucker. Come on. What do you do? I hate to break it to you boys. I've got nothing to do with Alistair Pinch Bull shit. You work for the network. It's in the trades. That's right. What the fuck? Knock them out. Come on. Just stay on. Kill Billy ass on La. Bitch. This is Lorena. You can leave a message. But if you want me to call you back, you better make it interesting. The mailbox is full and cannot accept me. Mr. Waldo Wilson Sigorski, head of the network, Bob In. You know, Fontella Davis, Alister Pence's attorney. Never had the pleasure. Hold on. Hang on. No, I'm not paying him 40. I'll pay him 25 because he sick from one ball. What was the last series? He had two years to be playing Sasquatch on the Discovery Channel. Hey, why did you put on the tray that I was working for you? Now, Mr. Waldo, when you land a star, you don't hide them under your ass. You tell the whole fucking world you were the youngest ever captured in the LAPD. Did we get that right? Youngest Detective security. Yeah, close enough. We want you to start right away. Even though Lorena Nat Demento seems unavailable. She's missing. When's the last time you talked to her? No, fuck, no. That I can work with. Then you do your homework. She's going to be exactly like her mother. Do you have kids, Mr. Waldo? I'm going to give you my cell phone. Don't call the office. My new assistant's a fuck with. But call me day or night, though I got to get this tied up. You may or may not be aware I'm facing a takeover and I won't join NCN with me tonight. I assume you know how to find a Barber shop. Hey, guys, thing is, I never told Lorena I'd do this. Sorry. So I tell you, my nuts are in advice. You give them an extra turn. Want more money? Just have your reps. Call me. Sure. It's worth twice. Now. What? It used to be this murder thing. Some wonders for the ratings. I could probably get 6 million up, but I got to have 100 episodes and you got 57. So I need two more years. Of what the table? Alice is pinch, healthy. Happy and off of death row. I can't take this. I only own 100 things. If I take that, it's going to be 101. Not really. It's complicated. Let's go with one of the other PiS. I know we said we needed to create distraction, but this. Come on. I found your work, too. A real Pi. One that knows how to do the job. Not just some has been. All right, look, I'm only here to tell you to put out a Press release that says I'm not involved. All right, but I turned it down. Can you do that? This is the hottest gig in town. Everybody's chasing it. Here's what I'll do. I'll introduce you to Alistair. I'll pay you for the day, whether you take the case or not. Excuse me. What was Lorine going to charge? 1000 a day plus expenses. 2000? Not to me. A donation to the Sierra Club and memory of lied on lift. Deal, Mr. Shame, your kids are going to miss this. You're about to meet a motherfucking legend. So Steve and I were at my estate. I was drinking, absent several snifters in. I decided that this would be the perfect night to teach Stevie Wonder how to drive and that it might be most entertaining to let him motor about the lawn with me outside the car, trying to Dodge you, too. Thank you, Cheryl. Anyway, I thought I'd give Stevie a sporting chart. So there I was, trousers around my ankles. Stevie gave it some stick and I spent the next fortnight pissing Claret in Ward C. Where's my mustache club up. Let me know when we're set gratu babies so strange. It is such a privilege to get to watch this man work. He's got a shitload of Shakespeare Wars under his bed. Greatest fucking actor since Brandon. I get him Wednesday nights after Jessica Beach background and action. Let me tell you a story from when I was just a tie in Tuscaloosa, my granddaddy Raymond, forbushaw he was a jurist himself. Family court. He used to step me on his knee and say, Johnny, for 99 days, the judge's job is merely to be that blindfold on the statue of Lady Justice for 99 days. You do that. And justice in its natural wisdom will find its own way. But Johnny, he'd say on the 100th day, a great judge knows that he needs to be justice. Now. I wouldn't be so bold as to call myself a great judge. But I do know that as I sit here today, I'm thinking about my granddaddy. And that's why I'm going to direct this verdict and find this here. Defended guilty. God. Wow, sir. That was terrific. Terrific. Bloody Jesus. You're not going to top that one. I'll see you all tomorrow, then. Did you hear what I just said? He's supposed to say not guilty. He said guilty. Just told me I had cancer. Sorry, Alexander. Yes. I hate to do this to you, but we're going to have to do one more. The last line is not guilty. What did I say? Guilt. The fuck I did. He didn't say that. But really, just. Please. No, I know what I said, love. So let's just look at the playback. He wouldn't have said that. Can we just see the playback, please? Do what? He was smarter. Do you think it's easy to carry this piece of shit on my shoulders? Week after week? You think I need a track like you standing there? How long have you worked on this show? My first week. So fast. Week of this fast week, everyone. You got. That's why I'm going to direct this verdict. I'm fine. Let's do this. Come on, let's do it. Let's roll pontiloski. Sometimes after loans, you always put a stunt guy right there. Pay him extra. Don't tell Alistair. Ready. Action and find this here. Defendant not guilty. Clark wouldn't be the first time I've had the clap. Not guilty. The Lord is the manner down to slum a bit with the vassals. To what do we owe the honor? I wanted to introduce you to Charlie Waldo. The Detective we told you about used to be King shit at the LAPD. The fallen angel. You've landed him. Did I promise you I would. I'd give you the shirt off my back. You know that? I'd prefer the watch off your wrist. Have you seen what this man wear costs more than the house I grew up in? Gadokey skeleton. They only make 35 a year. Maybe I'll make you a wrap gift of one. How's it? Can we have that? Find it blunt. He said I'm done for the day. Detective, do you have plans? Where do you live? Idle wild. I'm only here for today. The details. Which way? I haven't agreed to take this case. I'll find a hotel for tonight. Nonsense. You'll stay at my house. Great idea. Right to the scene of the crime. You don't mind sleeping surrounded by yellow tape, do you? This fucking guy. Come on, Waldo. What do you say? What's the worst that can happen? Lorena turns up in a day or two. You can go back to wherever you came from. Maybe you can get your reputation back. Just kidding. Was you and a wee sniff sub Detective? No, thank you. I deplore drinking alone. So I have a double. She was so proud of this room. Chinchin, this was in town in Wanker magazine. Why don't you walk me through that morning? All right. One more time. It was a Saturday. I woke up for King Two in my study about a half a mile down. That way, I realized I had no recollection of the previous nights. I came in here, found my sweet moniker. I ran back to the kitchen, dialed nine. One. One was a shattered vase. Anyhow. When the ambulance arrived, they told me she was already gone and had been for quite some time. Does anyone else have keys? Only Rosario. That's our nanny. And she was in Venezuela visiting her family. Nanny. Little kids in the house? Yes, we have one child, Gabby. She likely wasn't the killer either. But she'll be home from kindergarten soon enough. If you think it's worth trying to rest. A confession. Pretty glib, considering. Forgive me, dear. Gabby doesn't even know. Of course, the world is sudden. I murdered my wife, Mr. Waldo, and I can't even tell you the world is wrong. If you know a man who's handled a similar predicament with more Elam point me to him and I shall gladly emulate. You ever thought about trying to stop drinking, but this doesn't seem weak for that now, does it? Where would you come from? Want to hear us at school today? A little dog. Why, yes, of course. Brush every morning. Brush every night I brush and I brush so my teeth won't be white. Teeth can be shiny. Teeth can be gold. I hope I still have some when I'm very old. I do know it. Gabby. I'd like to meet my new friend, Mr. Waldo. He looks scary like a lion. Oh, you haven't decided to take the case yet, have you? What saved, Detective? Will you return to your mountain and leave me to the fates? Will you stick around the shitty of the Angels long enough to see the police? Maybe get it right this time. Whatever right. May look like Daddy. Can Mr. Line drive to school with us tomorrow? Can he please? It's perfect. And turn down the volume on the Media Circus. Oh, come on, Fontcella. You live for the Media Circus. Now I'm hearing there could be an indictment as early as tomorrow. We've not been told that. And now La Times is reporting that sources on the LAPD States there are no unidentified fingerprints anywhere in that room. What does that suggest to you? It suggests that the real killer knew what he was doing. You promised us Charlie Waldo from the Lattow Lipstick. What does it say? That he's not here with you? Charlie Waldo is busy uncovering. Welcome to kindergartens of the rich and fakes Gabby. Mr. Lion needs to talk to your teacher. But first, he's going to park this beach little blighter for you. I knew him. My sweet Gabby, a fellow of infinite jest and most excellent fancy hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now whole chord of my imagination. Please, my court rises at it. You're a shadow of your former self. It's a teatone fire and a pork chop and sandwich. No, I'm afraid it wouldn't do you any good. Dear boy, I think you're dead. Dead. That's tragic. Yes, indeed. It's tragic. Wherever your jibes now your gambles, your songs, your flashes of merriment that we're want to set the table on a rock. So they changed my nappy. Yes, that speech always slays them. Come, let's play on the swings. I believe Mr. Lyon wants to ask Miss White where the Daddy plays nicely with the other children. My name is Waldo. I'm a Detective working for Alistair Jane. My heart breaks for Gabby. Mr. Pinch is doing a lot to keep her spirits up. And Mrs. Pinch, what is she like as a parent? Mrs. Pinch, we have the children memorize these poems. I like to ask the kids whose mom and dad can recite them to half the time. These parents can't. But the nanny can in two languages. What about the Pinches? Mrs. Pinch never knew them. Mr. Pinch? Always. That's unusual. Definitely to shock the hell out of this place. Not me. Good morning. Okay, everyone find their place. Get your Bunny. We're going to start by writing our names on the back of them. Ms. White, I'm going to need to talk to you again. Sure. Does everyone have their Bunny from yesterday? Come meet me tonight. We can talk then. All right. Have you got your name set? Do you put your boots on your chairs at home? I live in a trailer with a chicken. What happens this day? Yes. That's the one she was killed with. What was that? Ceramic oven? Well, nice fathers are rather misses. What about that table? It's different. Moniker was a sinkerer. No room was ever finished. To her satisfaction, dear boy, that's outrageous award for my Richard. Did you move it. I've never been much for acting trophies. Monica had that one on display for sentimental reasons. That was the production on which we met. Really? Perhaps it's wherever Monica put my other regresses or my People's Choice Award. Oh, good night, sweet Prince. Flights of Angels sing me to thy bless there goes the good girl kindergarten teacher. Wait. So I have a few acres in me. I weren't your shock. The Monica Pinch was killed. Mr. Waldo, I have a confession. Okay. I've been watching all this TV coverage since the martyr. I know exactly who you were. The minute you walked into my classroom. I figured. Who was Liedo lips. Everyone keeps talking about litollips. I can usually tell when someone's messing with me. You're jamming at my radar. Maybe your radar is just rusty. Whiskey and good hair. It's been a while. Okay? If you want to know, I'll tell you, eleven years ago, there was a robbery, 711, the girl behind the counter and two customers got shot dead. I turned up. The kid leaned down, his lips, leaned on him pretty hard. He paid off. He said he was waiting in the car outside. And in return for a deal he would give me the shooter. Turns out that was like his brother signed, sealed to the races. Right? And I am on fire with ambition. Everything's going great. Cut. Two years later, Liedel comes up for parole, and the prosecutors asked me to help him prep for the hearing. So I go see the brother again. Who's in prison himself at this .3 strikes unrelated. Only now he tells me that the original story was bullshit. He made it up to get me off his back. So at that point, my daughter had been in jail for seven years. Three months and 16 days. Next thing I learned, it is a lot harder to get an innocent man out of jail and to put a guilty man in system isn't designed to deal with mistakes. And some individuals on either. I keep pushing and I keep pushing and I keep pushing. And I'm doing everything I can. And this goes on for a year. And then lifetime got stabbed. Yard fight, and he bled to death after spending every day of his adult life locked up or something that he didn't fucking do. When I ran out of people, I would listen. Which took about six months. I quit and I started talking to anyone with a microphone. I guess that would have burned a lot of bridges. Oh, I burned the fucking river. You still haven't told me what? Why weren't you shocked? I'm on a penchant. Of course I was shocked. And how could I not be shocked? Can't you tell when a girl just wants to have a drink? Cookie. Three years in the list. You haven't been with anybody all that time. No. Kind of hot ball, though. That's are going to arrest you. Those are news. Helicopters. Lapd is putting on a show. Go put some clothes off. Don't be set it off. The network will adore me in this wardrobe anyway. If it's good enough for Wacko Jacko, it's good enough for me. Beautiful Aleister Pinch. You're under arrest for the murder of Monica Pitch. You can't believe you old times. You made 10,000 good cops with the fucking clan. Say goodbye to your pretty house, huh, Olivier? Last time you got to see it, that is just going for a sleep of it. Be good. Don't be silly. We're paying the bail. It's only 20 million. Hold on. That's the end of it. I spoke to my guy at LAPD. He's why they turned it into a festival. You have to get rid of them. Look, I'm happy to quit. I don't want to make this worse for now. Worse. You're making it better. Listen, does one of you guys have the time? Apparently, I have Charlie Sheen in my office. How is he making it better? The bigger asshole is the cops are the more sympathy for protagonist. Sure, Waldo. You can't win them all. Yeah, you're right there. Oh, boy. You don't know me anymore. You understand? Boys are good to see you too, Freddy. You been in division yet? Probably 20 guys in that building like to knock my teeth out. 2120 is like a shoot them out with a bullet. I want the autopsy protocol on Monica Pinch. All the slides, all the photos. Yeah, good luck with that. They indict the fence has the right to everything. So you can deal with me. Or you can deal with Santella Davis, who's every bitter delight she sees on TV and who, by the way, never got you Laker tickets or lied to your wife to cover for you, Charlie. Straight up, Freddie. How'd you make this cerebral hemorrhage? Severe blow of the right temple. Second contusion. Back of the head. Probably from where she fell. Victim was found a lock in a house with a drunk of two assault convictions in England. So I'm guessing suicide and the alarm. You know about that, right? Turns out the alarm company hasn't been on since the previous night. Far after time of death. Too close to call. Guy clobbered his wife to death with a face. That's simple. Hello? I know who killed Monica Pinch. Who is it? Meet me at that rock pile you live at Waldo? Not there. I'm in La. He's a shit trailer now. Anything opened this shit up? It's a Kindle. How do you like it so far? I'm trying to decide between this and the nook. Looks a little cheaper. Like the Kindle for content. Content, right. How's that? Tech support. Keep looking pretty good out of ten. What would you give it? Eight. I'm Don queue. You heard of me? This man is Neeni. Do not fuck with this man. He was number one ranked. And you would light heavyweight. Nina, please me? Yeah. Salad Escobal. No, he's from Canada. You can say Eskimo, Alaska, but in Canada, they prefer to be called anywhere to them. Escamore is considered pejorative. Can we care for the chicken? There it goes. Wow. That was fucking good. Yeah, of course. That ain't the reason for our visit. Where is it? Where is what? The Mem that Lorena left with you. Where are all your possessions? Is that like the artist with a white and white and shit? Sort of like a lifestyle? How do things you got 24 hours and then I want my man. Where is she? Mini. Let's go. Charlie Waldo. This is what I want. One. Everyone who is on crime scene security two. I'll transport medical and emergency personnel out contact with victims and the suspect. No. Talk to them. Nobody gives them anythingto see. Here. Shows over. Let's go back. All right. How about first to respond? I'll start there, huh? Don't talk to him. Nobody talks to him. He's not here, right? You ignore him, understand? You do what I say. Not that you, Officer Amos. Anna. This school must have sucked. Do not speak to him, Annis you're at the penthouse. You're the first ones you and your partner. Do you know who Fontella Davis is? Ignorance. You want her on TV every night making this case about you. So it's over. We arrived to the house as the door dead bolted. Sure. Frosted glass. You couldn't see him unlock it. You heard him. That clearly the alarm was on. We saw him disarmament. What did I say? Yes, Anus. But the real killer could have set the alarm on the way out if the door wasn't deadbolt. Are they just talking? What about the murder? Wet the bullshit. The Earth and where Vase wasn't you? The gathered up. All the pieces was. Do not fucking answer him, all right? Yes. Well, he got all the pieces of the murder weapon. I supervised it myself. Earth and wear vase. Earth and wear base. Only the Earth. And where Vase is the murder weapon outfall. Some pinch killed her. That thing's got away. £28. It came down over the victim's right eye. You'd have to be a pretty strong lefty to make a shot like that. Not a drunken ritey. Almost convincing pinches of writing. I've watched him pour. Officer Anus. Can I have a moment? You see that statue? That's a Regis award for acting in England. You ever seen it before? Because it's missing. That's the murder weapon. Time to go home. Three and a half pounds. There are some more vase the victim hits out on the way down. Look at him. The Department is going to let you get fucked on this, believe me. And that's it. I'm going to give you 10 seconds. How about that? 10 seconds? Yeah, perfect. That's all I need. Nine tennis. You don't want to be the guy who puts away innocent man. Pull down your pants. It sounded like he fumbled with the what did I tell you he was still drunk? We couldn't tell for sure. Shut the fuck up. Anus. Nobody talks to this scumsack. This man is not a copy. It's not one of us. It's a fucking rap. He's a person of interest in a homicide investigation. For those of you that don't know body of one adult female ID as Lorena Nasimento. She borrowed her husband's Porsche. She didn't tell you about him, did she? We found it on fire off the freeway up by Magic Mountain. Fully engulfed body and size. That item she gave you. They could put on cure with her so long you both died. Natural causes. Give it to me. I tried to warn you. What the fuck? I had my bike on this rack. I think I left my lock for any specializing in personal injury. We do not onhand be those two damages, please. Your private eye. Fuck are you? You, sir, just committed a felony. Presenting yourself as a Pi in the state of California when you are in fact unlicensed. Now, I will level with you. I have a client who cannot understand why you would associate yourself with a murderer like Alistair Pinch. Beautiful watch. I'm not going to let you just communicate. There's been no threat from me, nor do I intend. I apologize, sir. Listen. It is my hope and my clients that this pleasant, circumstantial meeting between the two of us is the last time you and I with that in mind, sir, please take my things. Actually. 1 second thought. Neither one of these are my bike area. Come on. Who's going to help me? You're going to help me. Hey, don't look at me. You attacked me. I'm here. Two against one. Come on. She sent his force Machip. Take those handcuffs off his belt and hang up one of his wrists. Okay. Now have an idea. And I don't want you to panic. Okay? Just go with me. Now. We're going to take a little walk and you're going to introduce me. All right, let's go while walking. Okay? Got him. I'm Darius Jim Sheath. The real police will be here in a few minutes, but I'd be happy to speak with you. Until then. I see you're trying to buy a television network, huh? Huh? This ends with you walking out that door in a few minutes. You stick Warren Gomez on me. Are you suing me? You sent those kids two Palisades plasma. Question is, why do you want me to stay away from the Pinch case? I don't know who you are. You met my wife. But you just ruined my benefits. And no doubt cost a very important charity. Tens of thousands of dollars. I want you to go release those two men. And I want you to unlock that one man's ear from the other man's backside. I'll do that. My husband will show you to the tennis courts. You'll find those men there and your chain. Thank you. Household. She seems very nice. This has been delightful. The wall. As the next house backs out on a moleholland, he'd be so kind as to not cause any more drama in the party. Tell me who Warren Gomez is. Gomestead, what are you talking about? I just spoke with the police. Someone shot him just before you arrived. It wasn't you per chance, was it? Why don't you tell me what he was doing for you? Warren Gomez has had a talent for special research, which allows my company to make what it makes, which is money. The goal is digging up there to help you by the network. Why do you want me to stay away from Pinch? I believe that's for you. Where is Alistair. Line? Must have been distracted by our perfume. Things are getting fucking strange. And I need your help. Darius Jimshidi. That name mean anything to you? No, but Robert Blake called last night. Asked if I want to play Cheenical on Thursdays. You do realize that everyone is sure you did this. The only thing giving me doubts is if someone's busting my horns and me figuring out why is the only thing standing between you and a life sentence when I ask for help? I don't know. Maybe you should fucking help me. Is there anything you're not telling me? Like what? Like did you invite someone over to your house that night? No. Are you sure? Absolutely. Could you invite someone over to the house to not remember? The next day I've gotten married, father children and taken out mortgages and not remembered the next day. When did you move the furniture around? I told you Monica was a constant Tigger. She was never the night table in my room doesn't fit. I'm thinking someone moved it from your room. And the one in your room from the living room. Probably on the night of the murder. Unless you moved it. Since I have not moved them since. Piss off. What shall you do, Detective? Did you find that I did, in fact, murder my wife. Will you stand for your client or for truth and justice? Like the incorruptible Charlie Walder of your you stick with truth and justice. Water. If I've killed my little girl's mother, don't take what's coming to me and call it even. I can't wait to see your Ram. Fuck it. Tell me about Lorena. Fuck you. How about you? Tell me about my memory. Tell me about my memory. Who are you people call your jets now? I think you're preparing Waldo. She says she gave it to you. Last words the bitch ever said. So I'm inclined to believe her. You know, she was still alive when I put the gasoline on it. Dirty motherfucker. School nurse run home. I said I'll take care of you. No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't confuse you. It's 430 in the afternoon. Just had a concussion. Okay, let's go. Really slow. I'll drop you off of that stairs. A lot of traffic. Thanks for taking me home. I might have a better idea. Do you trust me? Why should I trust you? Because you'll like it. All right. Well, this is me. Have a nice day. You too. Doing whatever it is that you do, I might. Can I tell you the cheaper? Yes, I will. Get it back for you. Okay, will you? Thank you. You have a good day. Memory stick. Your old friend Waldo all your boss. You can have his meme. Maybe tomorrow. Wilshire and Catalina M 02:00. Young man, could I ask you to use your earphones, please? I mean, those are the rules. Excuse me. Who's that? You're listening to swaggog swaggong. Thank you. We got to talk about it. It's all over social media. But you're the first hip hop artist we've seen. His fellow's name Do G. G. That about. Well, you know that third G is from the Big Homie God, baby. Praise. That pink person around your neck. That is a purse. Hey, buddy. Your phone rules. Sorry. Hello, Waldo. Nice of you to call. Where the hell are you? I can't say. Listen, there's a guy who's going to reach out to you if he hasn't already. Oh, he has. He's for real. Don't mess around. I know. Everyone thinks he's killing you. He can't if he can't find me. Hi. I'm writing a piece of Esquire on the new Places. Hip hop? Are you okay? It's okay. It's all right. Can I have that, please? Backup meeting. It's all right. I got this pretty fucking bold of you. To be disrespecting me like that. Especially in light of Lori this final hours. You should have seen my fucking eyes when I left that match, bro. She was crying. It's not coming down on those. I just talked to her. Why don't we cut the bullshit? And you tell me why Lorena was messing with you in the first place? Hey, if you don't want that flash drive, I could always give it to the police. Go get yourself an ice cream cone. Give yourself an ice cream cone. Strawberry. All right? No problems at home. Just want to know you can talk to me, all right? About anything. Lorena was working for me. All right? Now what you think? Marital surveillance in Bath and my sister watching my lazy ass brother in law. Lorena comes to see me at this chop shop I use as an office. She sees my Mem sitting there, the bitch palms. It walks out the office like it's nothing calls me later, saying it's collateral in what she claims. I already owe her. All right, I think I got this. You open to a suggestion. What you got? All right, I give you the member. You let Lorraine and come back to La. We whack up the rest of small claims. Simple. It's so simple. I can't believe I didn't fucking think of that fucking nuts. I got a reputation to our Paul Waldo. Are you aware of that. Drive you're out of luck? I didn't bring. What did you just say, Waldo? You got a permit for this? I am arresting both of you for the murder of Lorraine and Nasimento. Want to reach your boy here at 06:00 news or what? Lorraine is alive. I just told it to her. What? Yeah. Fuck. Who was in a car then? Can I say you both suck at your jobs? Cuppy was never going to book us anyway. Just another play to squeeze me. Ain't that right, Cuppy? You know, I'm the only one in town who doesn't grease this motherfucking cock sucking motherfucker. You better watch your mouth and days that you're not followed around by that Douchebag escomah name you. Wait, you're fucking Philistine. You got another 24 hours. Well, though. Okay. Hi. The school directory. I can walk out with a manager of students in each class and his parents. It's Jay White. Listen, I'm onto something. What do you know about Darius. Jim, SHeidi and Swaggard, those animated characters. They both wanted me to stay the hell away from your case. I went to the school today and checked the directory. The parents in your daughter's class. Now I'm thinking the moniker could have been into something with these other parents, and one or more of them wanted to dead. Question is, though, what the fuck is going on in that class? Who knows? Show and tell finger painting. Hey, Princess, I'm trying to save your life. You want to cut the self pity? Self pity? Look, you got a terrific little girl who already lost her mom. She have to lose her dad. Nobody talks to me that way. And you know why? Because they need the money. No, because they know they get a damn good drobbing. Put them up. Come on, your turn off. You'll get a real fight. Okay, look, I'm a pacifist, and I refuse to get involved in this. I've had enough that's you and I have a drink. Help me out. Oh, you've trimmed the hedges, handsome devil. Do you remember having mates sent you wool, too? Not like you. There you go. You're right. Of course I am. Shiftist more than usual. Chinchin. You know what you should have done when you're a young man died? You should have gone on an epic, too weak pub crawl. Gotten it all out of your system. It's a self pity. It's a powerful observation coming from the master. You and I are two sides of the same coin, aren't we? And now here you are, back among the living in a way you weren't just a week ago. You see a difference. All the difference in the world. Looking refocus, the way you confronted me out there. You didn't have that in you when you first shuffled onto my separate rat's nest of a beard and those dead eyes, you've been brought back a Lifemate like so many of us by singular carnal charms. Is Jane keeping the baby? I think about her all the time, but I haven't thought of right to telephone, given the circumstances. And I was such a CAD. Especially after she told me when I was married. After all. And what was I to do? And then after the business of my sweet Monica, I'm tired warbell, fearing that you may not be as good as others believe. It's common to all men. But fearing that deep down you may be a monster. That's a whole different flavor of health. You should have told me about you and Alistair. There's nothing to tell you. Kindergarten did. The word. It's not Alistair. It's me. I found this burner in his house on the night his wife died. He texted back and forth to someone inviting her over someone. You said she'd be right there. Did you have a thing with Swaggon, too? Yes. And that crazy rich guy Jam Shady. You know, I've been getting beaten up and threatened the whole week because of you. It had nothing to do with Monica Pinch. It was a bunch of rich guys that didn't want their affairs with you exposed. What do you want, Waldo? I'm a thrill seeker, and I'm teaching fucking kindergarten. What could be a bigger rush than sleeping with the Detective investigating a death you're involved in? It wasn't just that I really felt something. Start from the beginning. And no bullshit. I was hoping that he would leave his wife, but he was an asshole. And he kept talking about how she wanted him to move back to England with her, but he didn't give a shit about what I was telling him. And after that total radio silence. But I kept texting him, which was probably stupid. And then one night, he messaged me back, saying that Monica was out the house and I should come over and we could talk about it before I can even ring the Bell. Monica opens the door and tells me to come inside. She's holding his phone. She's the one who messaged me to come over. She tells me Alistairs passed out in the study and she wanted to see what it was. When she found out it was her daughter's teacher. She got pretty hinged, kept talking about Holiday. Was this evil city and what a mistake it was coming to La. I was scared she was going to get violent. So I just ran out of there. I drove away. And then the next day, I heard Monica was dead. And I tried reaching out to Aleister, but he was even more of an asshole. He wouldn't talk to me, not even when he was dropping Gabby off when the chip started falling on him. And you're pregnant. Jane, we're about to start. Yeah, I'll be right there. Let me pick this up. Later. After the play in Lawyers King. Today I grew. That girl from Louisiana Law. What's her name? Yeah. I need to call her agent. I mean, is she pregnant or? I don't know. She's unhappy because it's weird. I don't know if she changed what she's eating, but to tell me that they're feeding her something very strange because I've never seen a shape quite like that. Wabbling was a lot, and I was like, It's not going to work. And I don't want to look at that. All right. Well, you talk. All right. Bye, Mr. Waldo. Mrski. Apologies for the interruption, buddy. I made some progress. Oh, you did fantastic. What is that? That my friend, is signed by every quarterback. Whoever won two Super Bowls. May I please be my guest? May I also say it is so good to see your baby face peeking out where once a dead animal lay. And just when you thought I couldn't get any more handsome. I have a run through. But fuck them. I want to hear this. Shoot. It's good news. I guess. I know. I'll give Monica Pinch. Fantastic. I mean. There'S a young lady named Jane White. She was the Pinch girls kindergarten teacher. What does kindergarten teacher want to kill Monica Pinch for? She and Alister. We're having an affair. You don't look surprised. They have a complicated marriage. You knew him pretty well. Knew him well, we did the same bars last year. I'm just so fucking relieved. It's not Alistair. I knew you were my guy. Pontella said, don't hire that bum. He stinks in every way. But I was like, no, that's my guy. And do I know casting or do I know casting? Is this chick in custody. Are we good, Jane? Yeah. No. She left town. I will find her. She's a fucking kindergarten teacher, not Whitey Bulger. That's a win win for Waldo and Sakorski. You get the killer. I get to keep my syndication. I mean, it's a tragedy, but as Tragedies go, but thank you. Great job. And you know Jane White. I know of her. Did you know that Houster got pregnant? Hey, I'm just wondering if that was something many people were aware of. Many people. No, this is the inner circle stuff, right? But you're in the inner circle. I found in the inner circle. He knows what I'm doing, if you know what I mean. I know he's doing if you know what I mean. So what was Monica bench's reaction when she found out Jane White was pregnant? She was devastated. I bet. I mean, she probably pushed down the street even harder to quit the show and move back to England. I can't speak to that because I don't know her as well as I know him, right? But you knew about the awards, the Shakespeare rewards you talked about. They're called Regis, by the way. What did you say? You said they were all under the bed. Under the bed, in the attic. It doesn't matter. He just didn't want them around. Got you. Funny. They actually were under the bed, so he wasn't sure where they were. It's not a big deal. Listen, this is great chatting with you, but time is not my friend. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm I'll let you go. Okay. Monica Pinch. Quickly. Monica Pinch. She didn't find out that Jane White was pregnant until the night she died. So she talked to you about it. It must have been then, right? I'm going to have to back you up a second there, Mr. Waldo. You said that Jane White was the murderer. Oh, no. I said I knew who the murderer was. Oh. Warren Gomez. Does that name mean anything to you? No, he was this lawyer. I had a little bit of a weird thing with him. He kept following me for a couple of days, and I kind of lost my temper, and I confronted him one day. We got into a little fight. A couple of hours later, he got killed. Yeah, I'm just trying to piece everything together. The question is why I bring it up. He had the same kind of watch as you rich lawyer. That's what I thought. Yeah, I researched them. They're all individually made, right? No two are identical. Here's the thing. The one he was wearing. It looked a lot like yours. Fear coincidence. This one hasn't left my wrist. Except when I shower and sleep. You asked one teller what time it was. What? When? At the courthouse. After Alice's Arraignment. I'm afraid you must be mistaken, but fuck it. Take a seat. I want to hear everything you're thinking. Soup to nuts. All right. Soup to nuts. Yes. Please double fuck the retweet. Let's do that. Let's do it. You sure? Yes, sir. Buckle up. Well, I'm thinking you knew what Monica Pinch kept under her bed because you were spending time in her bedroom while Alistair was spending time with Jane. Mr. Waldo, that is brilliant. I'm thinking that on the night she found out that he got Jane pregnant with Alistair passed out cold. I'm thinking that Monica called you to tell you she was going to tell Alistair about your affair, to get him to quit the show and move back to England like you've been wanting. But you couldn't afford to disallister. Not with the Jamsheedy takeover threat. I'm thinking you drove over there. You're going to talk some sentence, Monica, but you didn't want to hear it. Next thing you guys are arguing, it escalates, and you pick up the Regis Award and you hit her with it. You didn't mean to do it. It's an act of passion thing is, she's hit her head on the way down, and now she's not moving, so you panic, you start wiping down everything you can remember touching. But the Regis Award was on a wooden table and that had blood stains on it. Now I'm thinking I'm just thinking maybe you were worried that some of that was your blood. You could have got cut in the fight. So now what do you do? You swap around some furniture, you set the alarm on the way out, you get rid of the Regis in some dumpster, and you let poor old Alistair wake up to take the rap. How did I do? And the lawyer guy. He blackmailed you even made your cough up that fancy watch which you couldn't resist taking back after you shot him. That is quite brilliant. In fact, I should give you a pilot deal. There is one gaping hole in your narrative. However, why would I sabotage the biggest asset on this network? Come on. That's the easy part. You told me yourself the scandal made the show twice as valuable. You knew Alexa would get off. I mean, it's la. The store always gets off. And in the meantime, the more publicity, the bigger the windsall. So what do you do? You hire the lawyer who will make the most noise, and then the Detective who would make the most noise, even though your lawyer kept telling you I'd be a shitty choice. And let's be honest. I am a shitty choice. I've never been a Pi. The LAPD fucking hates me. I'm so rusty. I'd probably be useless. But I think you like me for those reasons, because that made me the last Detective who would ever figure out that you killed Monica Pinch and Warren Gomez. A lot of moving parts. A lot of moving parts. I do have one question. What made you so sure that you walk in here and deliver that little pitch? I'll be honest. I only walked in 98%. Sure. What was the other 2%. I had to make sure you were lefty. I did make one mistake, though. I really should have waited until the cops got here. You told them to come. Well, if I time to ride, they're already downstairs. Of course. I don't have to watch you. Just keep smiling. Watch your heck. Come on. Look like we saw this. He couldn't make it himself. He's not going to let you have this caller, right? I'm going to head to North Hollywood. Hope you don't meet him next cop fan worth breakfast. Shut the fuck off. How are you going to get away with it? Like, happens all the time. Last look. What the fuck is falling apart, although, thank you. But if you're ungrateful to ask what you're doing here. I've been following you since the recruiting office. Even had to sit through that Rumple stilt skin bullshit. Really? Yeah. How'd you get on the lot? Snuck in on a studio tour. They really need to check out their security. I could be like a crazy stalker or something. I hope you don't mind. I use your gun. I was never here. Yeah, I can work with that grand. You don't know why I saved your ass, right? Yeah. I got an idea. Someone else kills you first. I can't get what I want. It will be a mess. Nobody will know what to do with themselves. You know, I got to thank you. It's not too clever keeping your kind of business records in a flash drive. Is that what Cuppy thinks is on there? Business records, guys. An idiot. Why? What is on there? Epic poem. Long ass motherfucker, too. It's the only copy I got. Epic poem that you wrote. Yeah, that I wrote. It's about the life of a dealer trying to retain his independence and integrity in an era of corporate style cartels. Why in that big poem, see me? I'm an auto died act means I'm self educated. I had to enrich my own life. But my little girl, Elsie, I'm going to make sure my daughter gets a real education. That way, she ain't stuck being no cop. No dealer. I want to give the poem to her so she can see the man I really am. Waldo, I need my memory. I need Lorraine to come back. I'll tell you what. I want you to get my little girl into that fancy ass private school. Same one as that British. Those kid get him to help Dulce and bring me back my memory. And Lorena can come back. Have you got the juice for that? I just might. Okay, Waldos. You got another 24 hours. By the way, I love Johnny's Bench. You know, my granddaddy once said it's one thing to write like a poet and another thing altogether. Write like a historian. A poet can rehash or sing about things not like they were, but like they should have been. And the historian. Well, he's got to write about them. Not like they should have been right, but like they were without adding or subtracting anything from the truth. In fact, I remind you, Counselor, you are getting dangerously close to ruffling my feathers. Do you understand the words? Contempt of court. Come in. The man of the hour. Come here. Definitely stunned me. Old corcolom. No tongues. I want a lavish praise on you guys. Is it too much of a cliche to say? I don't know how to thank you. Is it too much of a cliche to say? I might have an idea. Shoot thinking you were right about that epic two week Pokemon. That's a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, as of today, this is my liquor of choice. Sober is a judge. Yes, very good. I may drop dead any second, but at least now I'm not inviting it. I made a shambles of everything. Walter. Monica's gone. Jane's run off with a son or daughter. I may never know. Upon the other hand, I do have my sweet gappy. The least I owe her is the best I have. I could take more courage than drinking yourself to that. But I know it courage, mate. Ready for you, Mr. Binge. Lift off. And don't tell anyone about this. They think I'm still a drunk. They'll still let me paste the occasional prism. Boy. I got your text. Thanks for squaring things with Q. And yet all you talked about was pinch. I wanted you to do that, too. Hope it didn't cause you too much trouble. Not at all. Made some new friends. Well, if you're upward got something else, we could work together. I don't think my face could take much more of your action. Stop being such a Princess. You know, you loved every minute of it. You look good. You look pretty good yourself for a dead woman. How'd you pull that off a corner down in San Bergie? Owed me a favor. They let me have it. Jane Doe. They were going to cremate. So I burned her in my ex husband's car. Ex husband almost ex. You want me to tell you if it bothers me that you got married? I don't need you to tell me. And you disappeared on me. I don't owe you anything. Hey, I didn't say you did. Why don't you tell me what happened to your beard? Who was she? You were dead fairly. My body wasn't even cold. I was grieving. Oh, you know what? Fuck it. That's it. You just breathe in and breeze back out. You ghosted me for three years. Then I drive up your stupid mountain and your ice man. You've come out here one week in La and you've got some little. You know what? Forget it, Waldo. I don't know what I was thinking. Give you a ride somewhere. Does it get 4 miles from the gallon? It's a C 300. I dropped 55K on it, and I fucking love it. So what's it going to take to get you to shut up about it. Let me drive.
