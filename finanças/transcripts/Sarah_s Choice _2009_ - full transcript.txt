You'll be buying a brand-new one soon. Don't jinx it. You look horrible. Jalapenos... ...I like them, but they don't like me. And arrivederci, Audrey. (female #2) Why do you say that? (female #1) Maybe because she's not coming back. And even if she does, she's definitely not going to work the Con-Ex account anymore. Too much travel. (female #2) Look at him. He just schmoozes. Chases her around. It's like he's a little puppy dog, "Like me, like me." (female #1) He's not smart enough to know that that's not going to get him anywhere. So, what should he be doing? Chasing after Henry and Nick? No, he should be chasing after me. And that my dear, Sarah, will prove to be his fatal mistake. Well, don't give him any ideas. ### (Sarah) I can assure you, sir, if you give me this opportunity, you won't be disappointed. (male #1) Please, you're practically middle management, Sarah. You don't have to call me sir. Thank you. Mr. Carson will do fine. (female #3) Are you sure you'll be comfortable with all the travel? Yes, yes. You'd think they've never heard of e-mails or faxes. Do you have any questions? Yeah. I was actually wondering what kind of raise I could anticipate with this promotion. (male #2) You had to open your big mouth, didn't ya, Henry? Sarah, let me tell you something. When I got my first real promotion, I asked the boss for a raise too. You know what he said? He said, "Nick, I would love to pay you what you're really worth, but we have a minimum wage law.'' We'll bring you up to 55. That's very generous of you, Mr. Carson, sir. I just thought it might be closer to 60. (Mr. Carson) Well, 55 is pretty close to 60. Not as close as 59. We can discuss this further after we've made our decision. You realize this position's temporary until we see whether Audrey is really coming back or not. Ahem! (male #2) Oh, right, we need to maintain the illusion that she's going to be back after her maternity leave despite the fact she spent the last 2 years running up our insurance costs just trying to get pregnant. (Mr. Carson) Naturally, we are obligated to keep her job open for her. But the work can't grind to a stop while she makes a decision. The work goes on. Absolutely, sir. Any further questions? I actually just wondered when you are going to make your decision. (Mr. Carson) The next phase of the Con-Ex campaign planning starts in 2 weeks. We'll have to make our decision by Friday. Okay. (Mr. Carson) Thank you, Sarah. This company's indeed lucky to have bright young people like you. Thank you, I?m the lucky one. (male #3) On your mark... set... (male #3) On your mark... set... Go! [cheering] Yes! Get it up! Yeah, man! Alright. (male #3) Twenty for you, ten-- Incoming! Incoming! Incoming! What next, Matt, betting on elevators? Dude, that was this morning. (male #4) But you realize if Novack gets wind of any of this, I?m going to have to make an example out of you. (Matt) Why me? Ooh gee, let me think. How about 'cause you're the ringleader? Circus master. What's wrong, Uncle Clay? Wrong? Nothing. No, no, everything's peachy, ever since your Aunt Geri gave me the good news this morning. She's cutting up her credit cards again. No. She's pregnant...again. No way, that's amazing. Congratulations Uncle Clay. Any idea who the father is? Oh, you're funny. Like a colonoscopy. (Matt) No, you know what's funny is picturing you with a little baby because you're so old. You've got something else in common with a colonoscopy. Oh, come on, Uncle Clay, that was needlessly harsh. (Uncle Clay) Do you realize that I have managed to get through three kids and not change a single diaper? And now, I am forced to defend my record. (Matt) So, have you guys like never heard of birth control? (Uncle Clay) Birth control, oh gee, what's that? Some kind of scientific breakthrough, you know, 100% effective, no problems, can't make a mistake, I don't know, kind of like filtered cigarettes? Oh, I have no doubt you guys are going to be fine. You're great parents. (Uncle Clay) Do you know what it's going to cost to put this kid through school? We're talking 100 grand minimum, maybe 150. (Matt) Yikes. And that's a state school. [phone ringing] Well, you take that call. I gotta go practice not changing diapers. Matt Evans. (male) I have Sarah on the line. Put her through. Matt Evans. I think I got it. Nice, what did I tell you? Didn't I tell you you had that thing? Did I not call that? Stop gloating and tell me where you're going to take me to celebrate. Maybe that's for me to know and you to find out a little later, baby. Okay, I?ll see you tonight. (Matt) See ya. Bye. ### Thanks. Thank you. You've already got the baby seat in there? I?ve already got the baby. So, did you get the job? I don't know. Like they called me in, but they haven't said anything yet, so we'll see. Oh, you'll get it. Thad isn't quite ready yet. Well, it's all temporary anyway, right? I wouldn't be so sure about that. I?m growing quite attached to this little guy. He's kicking. Do you want to feel him? Come on. Come on. Can you feel him? He's just so amazing. I can't imagine leaving him and flying to Baltimore five times a month. What could be worse than that? Actually living in Baltimore. [laughing] That would be worse. Thanks. I love this place. Man, look at these prices. You know the first thing I want to get? Is a loft apartment at Waterview. Megan showed me her place. It's amazing. And when you call the super with a problem, he actually comes and fixes it. (Matt) I'm sorry. Are we looking at the same menu here? Well, sweetheart, don't get too comfortable 'cause I am right behind you in the wage race, 'cause pretty soon, I?m going to be pulling in multiple streams of income from every which direction. You're not selling gym memberships again, are you? On the side? Hey, that's not fair. That would've worked. They just did not offer free weights. How am I supposed to sell gym memberships if they don't offer free weights? They were too limited in what they had to offer. A realistic commission would've been helpful. Didn't you lose like $800 on that whole thing? Okay, here's what's going to happen. I?m going to pass my Series 65 and it's going to be goodbye to the boiler room, hello big time. Okay. Okay. Ah! So, you want to celebrate? I want a Diet Coke. A Diet Coke? What's up? You don't want a real drink. It's Friday night. I threw up this morning. What? Yeah. Where did this happen? At home. That was a waste of vomit. You should've saved it for work. Thrown up at work, and then you could've used it as an excuse to take the day off. That is so disgusting. Thank you. No, that's smart is what that is. Thank you. I so don't understand Audrey. She went to college. She spent years and years working her way up through the ranks. Then she throws it all away for something any 15-year-old girl can do, you know? I mean, I want to have kids one day, but I?m not going to throw away my whole life to do it, you know? Well, good for you she did. Yeah, that's true. (Matt) Speaking of which, you want to hear something really funny? Mm-hmm. Uncle Clay and Aunt Geri are having another baby, their fourth. Wow, that's a lot of kids. (Matt) Uncle Clay is completely freaking out. Why's he freaking out? Well, there's the whole money thing. He's like already trippin' about how he's going to send the kid to college, Harvard. In a way, it's all his own fault. I mean, he should've never stayed at United after he got his financial advisor's license like he'd be making way more money as a mid-level broker than as a manager there. Why'd he stay? I don't know. I guess he thought the United job offered more security. Aunt Geri was pregnant at the time. Oh. You always lose when you let circumstances dictate your future. ### [phone ringing] Hi, Mom. (Mom) I didn't wake you and Matt, did I? (Sarah) Why would you wake Matt? Sarah, sweetie, I know he stays over now and again. Mom. Honey, all I?m saying is you have all the pleasures of marriage without the responsibilities. Mom, you know how responsible I am. Honey, it's not God's plan for your life. So, is this why you called? (Mom) No, I was just calling to tell you what I want for my birthday. Too late, I already got you something. Well, I?ll take that too. But I want to see you at church on Sunday for my birthday. Actually Mom, I haven't been feeling so good lately. Funny how you're always sick on Sunday morning. Can't I have my two daughters sitting by my side in church at least once a year? Okay. I?ll see you Sunday. Thank you, sweetie. Hey, mom? (Mom) Yes, honey. I thought we had St. Mary's paid up. They just sent me a bill for $340. (Mom) I forgot to call you. They called me last week. Apparently, an old radiology invoice has been floating about the system and-- Dad passed away 10 years ago. How can they do that? (Mom) Well, Sarah, at least they're not charging late fees. I?ll call and set up payments. No, you know what? Don't worry about it. I get my holiday bonus next week, so I?ll take care of it. Oh, Sarah, thank you. Thank you. (Sarah) Mom, you don't have to thank me every time we talk about Dad's medical bills. We're all doing our part. A mom couldn't ask for a better pair of daughters. I love you, Mom. I?ll see you on Sunday. Is something wrong? Looks like we're going to church tomorrow. Well, let's look at it this way. Maybe I?ll run into some bright, young, qualified candidates for my new business opportunities. (Sarah) Matt, it's not a business opportunity. It's a cell phone pyramid scheme. No it's not. (Sarah) Yes. This is not that thing. This is totally different. This has a liberal payout with minimal effort. Who wouldn't want to make money while talking on their cell phone? It's a can't-lose business opportunity. (Sarah) Thank you so much for coming. (Sarah) Thank you so much for coming. I don't know if I could've done it without you. It's not like I?m missing football or anything. 'Cause I am. At least you didn't have to go through this every week like I did before I moved out, okay? (male #5) "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, ''since I am a virgin?'' The angel answered, ''The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. Now even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age. And she who is said to be barren is in her 6th month, for nothing is impossible with God." "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered, ''may it be to me as you have said.'' And then the angel left her. Now today, I want you to hear the story fresh... Did Brenda get married? (Pastor) ...And deal with reality, just picture yourself... (Sarah) So much for Miss Goody Two Shoes. At least she's not living in sin with her boyfriend. (Pastor) ...But she had more to worry about than her parents being disappointed or her fianc? being angered. She was dealing with death. If she showed just a little, she would be stoned to death. "I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me as you have said." What courage, what faith, she was going to obey the vision that the Lord gave her. # Hey! # ### # Hey! # ### Ohhh! (children) Happy Birthday! ### (Matt) It's like I mean, who doesn't talk on the phone a lot? You've got something that somebody wants, right? You've got something-- How do you put up with that every day? That's nothing. Sometimes it just looks like the lunatics are in charge of the asylum. But when you're the head nurse, the key is to know when to send in the orderlies. I don't know what I?d do without him. (Sarah) Do you ever wish that you'd been better off financially before you had kids? Are you kidding? If everybody waited 'til they could afford to have kids, our civilization would've died off centuries ago. Yeah. Are you thinking maybe you and Matt? Are you going to set a date? No, no, no, no. I think we're a little ways off still. (male #6) Okay honey, could you come here and help please? Okay. I know, honey. Here I?m going to do it-- Sarah, thank you. It was lovely. Thank you, you're a wonderful daughter. Well, you know we'd do anything for you, Mom. Well, there is something you can do for me. You could come to our Wednesday night prayer group. Oh, Sarah, it's amazing. So many prayers have been answered. Yeah? We're actually-- We've got to go, Mom. We're going to head out. No, please don't go. No-- I love you. I love you too. Thank you for making this such a special day. Oh, good. You're going to come over and decorate the tree? Can't do it without you. (Sarah) We'll see. Thank you so much for having us, Mrs. Collins. Oh, you're welcome. I had a blast and I?m about to go into sugar shock right now. Well, you might want to take off your disguise. Of course, of course, thank you. Love you, Mom. I love you, Sarah. Stay warm. Okay. Goodbye. Yes...um... It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. Thank you for coming with me. Oh, come on. Have I ever tumed down cake and ice cream? I know I made you miss your football game. I appreciate you coming to church. It's okay. I?ve been following it. Thank God for cell phones, 6 point spread. Enough with the God talk. I get too much of that from the family. Okay, then how about thank Cleveland for the 100 bucks I just won. That's better. That's better. Oh! Oh yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Thanks, Sam. That was really great. These are my best pair of pants, buddy. They're not your best pair of pants. Any pants I have that don't have food on 'em are my best pair of pants. Oh. ### [knocking] Is something wrong? I just feel a little bit off. That's all. Jalapenos again? No. Come on. I?m not pregnant. Prove me wrong. Just a waste of money. I hope so. Occupied! I said it's occupied! What's the accuracy of these things anyway? They can't all be right. I should see a doctor. You get to work. I?ll take care of it. Get your coat, early lunch. You didn't tell him, did you? No, not yet. That's good. You can't tell him, at least not until you've decided what to do. It's your body and your choice. He's only going to screw things up. Besides if you decide to not have it, it's best he never even knows about it, especially if you want to continue the relationship. Come on. (Matt) What do you say, man, Finn's? We just ate there last week. Oh, that's right. You never eat at the same restaurant twice, I forgot. You want me to drive? No. I decided I?m living to a ripe old age. Too late. Where's your car? I don't know. I thought actually I parked right-- That's cute. And I hired you, why? Because you love me. Ha, ha, ha! Yeah! Woo! [laughing] (Doctor) Well, Miss Collins. It looks like you're 6 weeks pregnant. I can't have an abortion. No one is saying you should. But from the look on your face, it's obvious this isn't an intended pregnancy. Have you told the father? No. (Doctor) Do you mind my asking? Are you in a committed long-term relationship? Depends what you mean by committed and long-term? (Doctor) Well, have you discussed marriage or having kids? No. (Doctor) I can't begin to tell you how he's going to react, but I can give you some understanding on what you're going to face if you have to raise this child on your own. You know, the average first-year cost of raising a child is $16,000. Now, that includes medical care. And I can see from the forms that you filled out, you have pretty good health insurance. So we'll subtract that. That still leaves you with $7,982. Now, about your insurance, you get that through your employer, am I right? Yeah. (Doctor) Do you think you're going to still be able to remain in that job and give your child the attention it deserves? I don't know, but I just know that I can't have an abortion. (Doctor) May I ask why you're so opposed to the procedure? Is it because of religious beliefs? I understand. I was raised in a faith environment too. Now look, the Bible is a beautiful book and it's filled with great stories. But you must remember, it is not a science textbook. The fetus is no bigger than this eraser. It's got no arms or legs, no eyes, no brain, no heart. It's just a pre-human clump of cells. Is it alive? Well, of course, it's alive. But no more so than your tonsils or a wart. Would you let a wart destroy the life you have planned for yourself? (Sarah) A wart. She compared a baby to a wart. She compared a fetus to a wart. Okay, it was a bad choice of words. Then she kept saying ''procedure'' like it was some kind of a tummy tuck or a Botox injection. What a benign word for such an ugly operation. Have you ever seen open-heart surgery? It ain't pretty, but some people have to have it. My scarf, I forgot my scarf. I?ll meet you at the car. (female #7) Don't do it. ### Three visions. The Lord will give you three visions. (women shouting) Please choose life! Please choose life! (Megan) Why don't you get a life you judgmental hypocrites! Why are you taking this so personally? (Megan) I can't stand to have people like that judging me. (Sarah) Judging you? They didn't even see you. They did when I was 16. Yeah, I was a junior in high school, in love. I wanted to have the baby. But you know my mother. If she's not busy messing up her own life, she's busy messing up mine. Sounds like you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself. (Megan) I only hated her because she was right. (Sarah) Was she? As much as I hate to admit it. I mean, do you think I?d be where I?m at now if I had a kid at 16? Can you imagine me with a teenager right now? (Sarah) So, what about the father? What about him? (Sarah) Didn't he have an opinion? Not according to my mother. But didn't he want-- (Megan) Oh, of course. Of course. We were in love, remember? As in love as two 16-year-olds could be. We were going to get married. He would get a job. We would get an apartment. And somehow, we would all live happily ever after. And then you know what happened? Reality struck. Do you honestly think two 16-year-olds with no high school diplomas and no income could possibly raise a child? Look, Megan, I?m sorry. (Megan) Don't apologize. Do you know what ended up happening to the baby's father? The absolute love of my 16-year-old life? He delivered a pizza to my mom's house last month. A pizza! My mother couldn't wait to tell me. So, you see, the story had a happy ending after all. (Matt) So, I called Uncle Clay, right? I'm like, "Uncle Clay, I got to talk to you. I?ve got questions for you about the business world, you know? What tips can you share with me? What can you bestow upon me of wisdom that will serve me in the future, you know, keep me wise, right? So, he comes in my cubical, he starts talking to me. He's like, ''You know, the one thing I?ll tell you--'' He's like, ''When it comes to trusting people short of close family and friends in the business world--'' He's like, ''Never trust anyone. Because right when you think you've got something with 'em... Bam! They got ya.'' So meanwhile, Jim swipes Clay's car keys, moves his car, replaces it with a baby carriage. So, we walked down to the parking garage, right? We like get to his space. He's looking for his car. The look on his face when he sees a baby carriage sitting in his parking space where his car was supposed to be, it was classic. That was meant to be funny? Yeah. It was very funny. Okay, you had to be there. Well, what if you were in Clay's position? Would that joke be funny? Well, first of all, I would never be in Clay's position. Babe-- Guess what? You are in his position. I?m pregnant. We're pregnant, 6 weeks. What? Say something, Matt! How? I mean, weren't we? Didn't? Are you sure? What kind of-- What kind of question is that, Matt? Of course, I?m sure. You can't exactly spring this on a guy and expect a coherent response, okay? I mean-- There's only really a couple options, Matt. You either give me a wedding ring or you give me a ride to the clinic. The clinic? I had plans, okay? I mean, we had plans. Plans? Like growing your next business opportunity? Or building your retirement with your sports betting? Matt, the only reason you kept your job is because your uncle gave it to you. Look, I?m not saying that I don't see you and l together in the future. It's just not now. I mean, we're not ready. We're not ready? Or you're not ready? Sarah...Sarah... Sarah! # So ask me no questions # # I'll tell you no lies # # If you don't want the truth then--## # If you don't want the truth then--## Arms and legs stretching out more and more. Onset of the eyes appear, brain is developing. You don't look like a wart to me. ### [baby crying] Mom? Whose? (Mom) There you are. Daisy and I were starting to worry. Are the roads bad? No, the roads-- What? Roads? Are you okay, honey? Oh! She needs to be changed. There you are. You take the baby. There you go. [baby crying] Oh, she needs a back rub. Oh! And give me your coat. I?ll take it. Oh, oh. You've got to change her now. Mom, why do l have to do this? Well, why not? She's your baby. ### # When you weep # # there are tears in my eyes # # When you're afraid # # and all the fear you feel inside # # But in your mind you think # # that I'm a million miles away # # Did you forget I never left # # 'cause I am here to stay? # # I created you # # and I formed you in my hands # # When I breathed my life into you # # I had a purpose and a plan # # I know you think I don't understand # # what you're going through # # I gave you my heart when I created you ## ### (Sarah) It's not a clump of cells. It's a baby. Of course, it's a baby. What were you expecting? The real question is what are you going to do? I haven't decided yet. What's there to decide? A child is going to change everything. Do you really think they're going to give the Con-Ex account to another pregnant woman? The Con-Ex account is the least of my worries right now. (Megan) Can you afford to raise a baby? (Sarah) They can't fire me 'cause I'm pregnant. (Megan) No, they won't fire you. But there's nothing keeping them from giving the Con-Ex account to Thad. I can't make a decision about my life based on what the Carson Group wants. Look, if you want 3 hours of sleep at night, no social life, no money, have the baby. Have you told Matt yet? Sarah, remember yesterday? I told you about the guy who got me pregnant. Pizza delivery guy? Yeah, but he didn't start out like that. He was a great guy. He was on his way to Syracuse to get a lacrosse scholarship. But after the whole pregnancy thing, he went off the deep end. I can't help but think if he never knew I was pregnant and had an abortion, he could go on with his life. Maybe we would've ended up together. Look, I would've done the same thing again if I had to. I just wouldn't tell him about it. I better go. Yeah. Hey, you know how I told you yesterday about that old woman that said I was going to have three visions? Mm-hmm. I had one. And I had the baby and it was this little girl, and she was-- (Megan) Sarah, it was a dream. That old woman was probably one of those protestors. Megan, it was so real. (Megan) That's why you can't talk to those religious people. They get you at an emotional moment, and they put these thoughts into your head. You're very vulnerable right now. Just ignore it, okay? Okay. ### (female on phone) Sarah? Um, 70/30. (female on phone) What about the billboards? They're fine. They're okay, and so is TV. (female on phone) Okay. Let me get back to you. Okay. [phone ringing] Sarah Collins. Sarah, we need to talk. (Sarah) So, what have you decided? Ah--Sarah. (Sarah) What are you going to do, Matt? Don't make this all my decision, Okay? We can sit down and talk about this like responsible adults. Responsible? Like you're meant to be responsible? Pulling pranks while you could be studying for your Series 65 exam, that's responsible? Sarah, we have options, okay? There are other things to consider. I mean-- (Sarah) Like? Like you could have the baby. We could find some rich couple and put it up for adoption, you know? (males shouting) Go! Go! Bring it, bring it! They're going to get it. Get it up! Yeah, man! (Mom) Darling, we need that, yes. Alright-- Look at this. (Mom) You like this one? [laughing] I?ll put this right here 'cause I love you. (Mom) Alright, oh, look at this one. You want to hang this? (female) Sam, come on, this one. You have to leave this house. Because then Santa Claus will come if they go to sleep. (Mom) Oh, Sarah, do you remember making this? Just think, some day your children will be gathered around the tree like this. Sarah made this when she was a little girl. (male) Oh, it's pretty. (Mom) Do you like it? (male) I do. How old was she? (Mom) She was eight. Hang it on the tree. Talented girl. Yes. You wouldn't happen to have any Christmas spirits stashed away anywhere, would you? No, sorry. What's wrong? Nothing. Is it Matt? Talk. I?m pregnant. Pregnant. I?m guessing it was an accident. Yeah. What are you going to do? Not tell Mom, for one thing. I mean, are you guys going to get married? That way you can quit your job. There are other options, you know? Sarah, you couldn't. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. What about Dad's medical bills? And Matt, he can't hold down a job for more than 6 months. I can't wait around for him to grow up. He doesn't even have a savings account and he works in an investment firm. I don't have a choice here. Of course you have a choice. What does Matt think? He doesn't think. That's the problem. He's not ready for this. Is anybody ever ready to have a baby? It's difficult and demanding and messy and annoying. And at the end of the day, it's just more satisfying and rewarding than you could ever imagine. Sarah, have the baby. We'll get the bills paid eventually, and Matt'll grow up if he has reason to. 'Cause you know, he really loves you. Yeah, obviously. Enough to get me in this mess. Like you had nothing to do with it. Denise, my whole entire career has been centered around this promotion. I had a plan. Doesn't mean I?m going to be strapped like Mom and Dad. Carson Group is not going to give their most profitable account to a pregnant woman. Sarah, it's not like you're going to be pregnant forever. I mean, you practically work right up to the last minute. And anyway, I hardly think you work for a bunch of heartless savages. You should have heard what they were saying about Audrey. Working women get pregnant all the time. And guess what? They have legal rights. Okay, so I have the baby and then what do I do? Go back to work with it strapped on my back? Look, I am not saying it's going to be easy. But look who I?m talking to. You were able to put yourself through college and graduate with honors. I mean, just look at this as life's next challenge. And you know, I could take care of the baby while you're at work. I couldn't ask you to do that. You're not asking. I?m volunteering. I'm at home all day anyway. What, don't you trust me? Of course l trust you, Denise. I just--I don't want to punish you for my mistakes. (Denise) If you're that concerned about taking care of a baby, then Justin and l could adopt it. That'd just be too weird. I think it's just better for everyone if... ...I just get rid of it. Sarah, you can't have an abortion. Why Mom? Because abortion's a sin? Well, what about being unmarried and pregnant? What about that? Is that a sin too? That's not. But what you did to get this way is. Great. No, you cannot negate one sin by committing another. Have you ever thought that just maybe there's no such thing as sin or God? Sarah. Do you remember when you came into my room and you said, ''Don't worry, Sarah, I prayed and I felt God tell me ''that everything's going to be okay, Dad's going to get better''? Well, what? Was He lying to you? Or maybe it was just all in your head? And maybe what happens to this only matters to me. Sarah, God knows what's best for us better than we do. Well, you know what? Right now, I don't even think He knows I exist! Sarah. (recording on phone) Hello, and thank you for calling the Women's Clinic. Currently, we're closed. If you'd like to schedule an appointment for a procedure, press 1 for our 24-hour scheduling. [phone beeps] (female on phone) Hello, may I have your name please? Sarah Collins. (female on phone) Well hi, Sarah. Will this be your first time for a procedure like this? Hello? Hello? Are you still there? #And then she smiled at me--# #And then she smiled at me--# (Matt) I love her. She loves me, I think. Shouldn't that be enough? Oh, Matt, Matt, Matt, my simple-minded little nephew. You think your Aunt Geri and l love each other? You don't? Sure we do, most of the time. It takes work, you knucklehead. Love isn't this thing that sticks to certain people. Love is like--I don't know, it's the result of fighting for a commitment you made. Love is never giving up when you just can't go on any longer. Hey, love is living for others. You ready to do that for Sarah? Yeah, I think I do. I mean, I was thinking about asking her to marry me after I passed my Series 65. There you go. What's the problem? You're just speeding up your timetable a couple months. No, no, it's more complicated than that. Like, I?m thinking if I asked her to marry me then and she said yes, it'd have been because she loved me. But if I ask her to marry me now, I?m thinking it's only because she needs me for the baby. Alright, let me get this straight. You want her to love you, but you don't want her to need you? No, that's not what I?m saying. I just don't see how a marriage that starts this way can work. I mean, it's like I got a gun to my head. I?m bound to feel resentment over time. Matt... [clears throat] ...come here. Think! Oh! When's Katie's birthday? February 10th. Close enough, February 8th. When's my wedding anniversary? I don't know. It was summer sometime. July 29th. Do the math, Einstein. You're kidding! Thank goodness your grandmother always assumed Katie was 2-month premature. Let me tell you something, buddy. People nowadays, they fall in love and they get married. But then they fall out of love and get divorced. You have no idea how hard it was for your Aunt Geri and l, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. And I?ll tell you why. Because most people give up before they even get to the good stuff. They don't even get there. And here's the secret: the good stuff-- no, the great stuff-- it's real. You could have the great stuff. But you can only get it by going through the bad stuff 'cause that's where the great stuff is. It's called being a man, buddy. So, no, I don't regret a thing. Until this week. Eh, after three kids, I have the right to complain. You know, women should learn how to tell their husbands they're pregnant on Fridays, that way you've got all weekend to, you know, let it sink in, have a little nervous breakdown and then be prepared to get thrown back into the real world. So, you're okay with this? Yes. Even the college fund? They're going to need a good education if they're planning on taking care of me in my old age because as you know, I have very expensive taste. Mmm. You wouldn't know it by looking at ya. You wouldn't? I drink Pepsi. [laughing] ### ### (little girl) Happy birthday, Mommy! I made breakfast! Wow. Do you like it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah. Aren't you going to eat? Yeah, yeah, of course, yes. How old are you? It's not my birthday! It's your birthday. Okay. Let's say grace. Okay, go ahead. Now, I lay me down to sleep. [girl laughs] No! Dear Jesus, thank You for this food and bless it to our bodies. And please make this Mommy's best birthday ever. In Jesus' name, we pray, Amen. Do you want some? No thanks, I had the ones that didn't work out. How many of those were there? (girl) I don't know, about eight or nine? Well, you must be full. That's a lot of eggs. So, what do you want to do after breakfast? It's your birthday. You get to do whatever you want. Hmm. What do you think I want to do? I think you want to go sledding. That's exactly what I want to do. ### Woo! Ahh! # I am searching for a sign # Woo! # I am waiting for a light # Ahh! # I'm just looking for a sign # # always trying to get things right # Woo! # But I try too hard # Woo! # I need you # Oh! # I need you to help me through this life # # I need you to make things right # # I need you--## Mommy, I love you. [dog barking] So now you're interested, huh? Well, you're a whole decade too late. This baby is worth more than my dad? Are you kidding me? Thank you. I just want to talk to her. She won't take my calls. Do you blame her? I just want to tell her how sorry I am and, you know, tell her what a big mistake she's going to be making. You know, Mom, I think she got that part. She might've done it already for all we know. There must be something we can do. (Denise) Ye of little faith. Ring a bell? There is something you can do. Pray? And have you? Of course I have. Maybe as hard as I prayed for anything. Maybe even more than I prayed for your father. Only that one didn't get answered. Mom, all prayers are answered. You know that. They might not get answered the way we want them, but that's why we have faith. God knows what's best for us better than we do, remember? I know. But what will we do if she has the abortion? She'll still be your daughter, and she'll still be my sister and we'll love her just as much as we always have. Yes. (Denise) Have faith. All right, all right, that's enough. Oh, that's enough. It's okay. Thad's clever. He knows the way to Nick's heart is through his golf bag. Is it true? Do you think I?m going to lose the promotion if I have the baby? Technically, you can't lose a promotion because it hasn't been offered yet. If you have the baby, will you be able to devote as much time and energy as Thad to the job? As a woman, I sympathize with you. I?m on your side. But equal rights mean equal responsibilities, and the truth is it's women like Audrey who make our jobs more difficult to actually break through that glass ceiling. If you want the job, take care of things by tomorrow. You're a young woman, you have plenty of time to have a family later. (Megan) They didn't like your concept? So what? Change the size of the font and move everything over to the left and they'll love it. We charge 'em for the time and the agency makes more money. I need to talk to you. I gotta go. Jennifer found out I?m pregnant. I know. I told her. Uh, you told her? Had to. She called me into her office yesterday and asked me if I had any long-term concerns about your abilities. You're my friend and you told her? What were you thinking? (Megan) I am your friend. Are you mine? Yes. Well, you wouldn't want to get me fired, would you? And that's exactly what would've happened if they found out that I knew and didn't tell them. Would that make you feel better if I got fired? What did she say? I had another of the visions. Sarah, don't go psycho on me. You had another dream. No, remember last time, Daisy was just a baby. Daisy? You remember? My daughter. Oh, right. In the dream. This time she was about six. We went sledding. Stop. Those religious people are making you feel guilty for something you haven't even done. It sounds like you're the one feeling guilty. I was in no position to have a child. If I had, I doubt I?d even finish high school, let alone college. I'd probably be living in some awful apartment, living on welfare. What kind of life would that be for me and my baby? I never even think about it except for-- Do you remember the company picnic last year? I said I was sick and I had to leave early. I wasn't sick, not physically. I was fine until Lisa came with her son, who would've been the same age as... ...my child. And now I don't know if I?m going to have anybody. How do I know I?m not going to feel the same way if I have an abortion? You can't. Sarah, I made my choice. You're going to have to make yours. Just make sure it's a decision that you can live with. ### [phone ringing] ### How? I tore it up. Hi, I was just wondering if you could help me with something. Yeah. I?ll try. I was in here a couple days ago and there was this old woman that was handing out these cards. And I just wanted to know if you knew anything about her or where I could find her? This is a Christmas card. We don't hand anything out like this. You haven't seen anybody handing out anything like that? No. You know what? Keep it. Excuse me. Oh, sorry, sorry. No, it's okay. We're just a couple minutes away from filming. Thanks. (Sarah) You're filming protestors? No, these aren't protestors. These are gals getting ready to send letters to heaven. It's a post-abortion recovery group is what it is. And the balloons, why? The balloons give 'em an opportunity to write a letter to their unborn child and name them and then release them into heaven. You know, these gals know that God's forgiven them. But they're struggling with forgiving themselves. Does it actually help? Yeah. It does. Anytime in our lives when we make a bad decision, it's great to have a chance to seek forgiveness and move on and that's exactly what they're doing. It's very powerful. (Sarah) I have kind of a weird question for you. Is your question, ''If God is so powerful and He can do anything, can He make a stone so heavy that He can't lift it''? No. I?ve been wrestling with that one for years. How can I help you? I was just wondering if you think that God still reveals Himself to people through visions and dreams like He did in the Bible. Well, some people believe that God stopped revealing Himself in dreams and visions at the completion of the Bible. But I myself think that God is so powerful that He still reveals Himself to the young children that He loves. Why? Are you having visions? (Sarah) I might be. Yeah, I have a very important decision to make, and I need to make it soon. And I?ve been having very vivid dreams that show me what would happen if I do this and actually what would happen if I don't do it. And I really just need to know how I can tell if these are true visions. And I would just think them just dreams if it wasn't for this card that I can't find now, figures. Sarah, the only way to discern the truth of any vision is to measure it against the word of God. But I don't have the time to search through the whole Bible and see how they fit. Okay, then let's take another tactic. Is the decision that you have to make morally neutral where either option could fall within the will of God? Or is it a case where one option definitely falls outside His will? The second. (Pastor) Then does it really matter whether the visions are legitimate? You obviously know what God wants for you. Forgive me, but it seems a little late in the day for God to start caring about me and my needs. (Pastor) I don't know what dilemma you're facing now, but I know that you're at a crossroad and the Lord is here for you. Come to Him, and He will give you the strength and wisdom to overcome any obstacle you face and put a joy back in those eyes that I haven't seen for years. (males shouting) Alright, we're at the races, guys! Pony up! Final bets! Get it in! Get it in! Saddle up, boys! On your marks, get set, go! Woo! Go Robert, go Robert, come on! Get it in there! Go! Go! Go! [shouting] Sarah, please just don't go-- I don't know what to say. Could you just call me back please? I love you. Hey, you missed a running of the armchair 500. I?m guessing the winner paid four to one. It's funny how that doesn't seem to matter to me a whole lot right now. So, no news yet, I guess, huh? I just keep leaving messages. She won't take my calls. Well, don't give up. She'll come around. They always do. (Matt on phone) Sarah, would you please call me back when you get this? Look, I want you to-- ### (female) Mom, we're here. Daisy? (Daisy) Hey, Mom. (Matt) Where's my little munchkin? She's right here waiting for you. Let's say hello! Hello! Boogity-boo-boo-baby! Are you Santa's little elf? My granddaughter. She's mine, too, you know? (Sarah) Are you glad we did it? (Matt) Did what? (Sarah) Daisy-- [laughing] This one has a tiny little thing on it. Nice! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! (Sarah) Are you glad we did it? (Matt) Did what? (Sarah) Got married? Well you know, it wasn't like we had much of a choice really, was it? (Matt) Oh, we had a choice and I think we made the right one. Don't you, little angel? Yeah, I do. ### Ms. Collins? Yes. (Nurse) Sarah, how are you feeling tonight? (Ms. Collins) Fine. (Nurse) So, you going to be having any visitors tonight? It is Christmas Eve. (Ms. Collins) No, anybody that cared about me is long gone. (Nurse) Oh, you poor thing. Well, I care about you, Ms. Collins. Have a good Christmas. (Ms. Collins) You too, dear. Thank you. Excuse me. Do you think it'd be okay-- Are you Sarah? It's you. No, you. Me? (Ms. Collins) Yes, I am you, a lot older and a little bit smarter. Why am I here? (Ms. Collins) To see. To see what? The direction your decisions are taking you. Did I go through with it? (Ms. Collins) No. I did. You didn't. Not yet. Your baby's still alive inside you. You don't want to die alone, do you? Trust me. You don't want to think every minute that you've done the wrong thing. Sarah, you've been given the opportunity to see things from a divine perspective. Now, have courage. Have faith. And make your choice regardless of the consequences. (male) You can talk about-- I--I came because I thought that it was only fair that you know that I?m pregnant. I just--I thought you should know. Yeah. (male) Looks like Thad's our man, at least he won't get pregnant. Really? Yeah. Jesus? I?m so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to be a mother. I need You, God. I need You. O Lord, I?m so sorry for the way that I have hurt You. I just miss my dad. I miss him. I wanted him here. I wanted him. I miss him so much. I was so mad at You for taking him from me. But now, I know that he's with You. He's with You. Thank You for these visions. I don't know what l would've done without them. Thank You for saving my baby. Show me how to be a mother. Show me how to love her. Show me how to look after her. Just take care of me, Jesus. Take care of me. I want to be Yours. I want to be Yours. Forgive me. Forgive me. I love You. ### ### (Matt) I... I want you. Don't do that. I need more. We need more. (Matt) Sarah, look. I'm not perfect, but I will do my very best to become the best man that I can for you with God's help. I can't promise you I?m not going to make mistakes. I can't promise you that I won't be human. But what I can promise you is that I will never leave you. I?ll never let go of your hand when it gets dark. And when life tries to hurt you, I promise you it's going to have to get through me first. You've been dragging me behind you for way too long. Now, it's time for me to carry you a while. So, I guess you've made your choice. Well, I?m making mine. ### (Pastor) Now before we all rush home to our Christmas gifts and our Christmas dinners, I have a few announcements to make. First of all, I want to thank our choir for celebrating our Lord's birthday in such a splendid manner. [applauding] Now, for those of you "CME Christians," that means Christmas, Mother's Day and Easter Christians, I want you to know that our church is open all year round. I also want to announce the upcoming wedding of one of our members, Sarah Collins. [applauding] Sarah, it will be my pleasure to welcome you and your husband-to-be, Matt, into our church. ### # Hush my baby # # Be still inside me # # Rest my child, all is well # # Hush my baby # # Grow inside me # # You are safe there, my little girl # # I can't believe that I could ever think # # that you were not to be # # But darling, Mommy feels like a child herself # #And I... # # ...will give my life # # ...will give my life # # to love you, little one # #And I... # # ...will give my life # # to protect you, darling # # always # # always # ### # Hush my baby, I'm dreaming of you # # wondering just who you'll become # # Hush my baby smile inside me # # warmed by knowing you are loved # #I can't believe that I could ever think # #of life without you # # But darling, Mommy sometimes feels afraid # #And I... # # ...will give my life # # to love you, little one # #And I... # # ...will give my life # # to protect you, darling # # always # # always ##
