There is nobody here. They must be on their way. It's almost eight o'clock. Yeah. Are you nervous? No... but I'm not bursting with excitement. It will be fine. Work outside all summer and the guys are fun. Did you ask the guy about the pay? No, I haven't heard from him. It's probably decent money. It better be. Renting that flat isn't gonna be cheap. I know. Won't that be OK once you have a real job? Are those the guys? -Yes, that's them. Well, I better get in there. See you later. Bye. -Bye. Good morning. -Good morning. Hi, I'm Tommi. -Kiddi. Tommi. -Finni. Do you want some coffee? -Yes, please. So... what's up guys? Have you been working here for long? -Too long. Yeah, few years. -Years? During the winter as well? -No, I bait in the winter. How about you? Ever done this before? No. This was my only option for the summer. I came here with my girlfriend. You know her, right? Yeah. -Yes, I know her father, Nonni. My father used to work for him when I was a puck. A puck? -Yeah, when I was a kid. Where the hell are you from? -I'm from Grafarvogur. OK... do you go to school? I got a bachelors in software engineering a few years ago. I plan to do my masters this autumn. Each morning before we have coffee, we open the container. Come on, open it. The other one too. Just to air out? -No, the boss drives by each morning and if the box is open he assumes we're working. We just put the sticks in here. Did you see? -Yes. OK, you try it! Come over here. Which frequency are we using? Here you go. Can you hear me now? Here is the hand brake. -OK Switch on here and you have to warm it just a little... for a few of seconds. Then you just start it. Was that part of the course? Yeah... it was supposed to be a driving range. But we stopped maintaining it. Why? -The goddamn tern seized the area. It's incredibly hostile. It starting spreading so we couldn't mow it anymore. Pecking at us left and right. Look! I'm never going there again. Good morning! -Morning. So, are you abusing the new kid yet? Isn't that your job? -Shut up Finni! Have Laurel and Hardy managed to show you the ropes? -Pretty much. Tómas, wasn't it? -Yeah, or just Tommi. Yeah? Tommi the tomato? -Right... Well, come inside. I come bearing news. After two weeks we're getting some visitors from the Icelandic golf association, playing a round on the course. What the hell for? -Silence, Finni! To see if it's up to standards for their county tournament. So in two weeks time, everything must be tip top. Have you hosted it before? -No... so we're going all out to make this happen. If they don't like it they'll go to Ísafjörður. That better not happen... No... that better not happen! -The guys from there are assholes. Maybe not assholes, but they can be a bit difficult when they come here to play. -Difficult? They're all maggots. Þrándur certainly succeeded in spreading his evil among them. Þrándur? -An asshole. President of their golf club. -Or the spawn of the devil according to the phone book. Enough of that. In a fortnight the course will be tip–top. Is that clear? Since when do you follow soccer? How am I supposed to get back to Ísafjörður? It's the first day, I don't even know them. Yeah... I can ask him. Yes. Bye. Finni? -Yes. Can you drive me home? -No, I've got to work at the pool. Isn't Rakel picking you up? -She's watching a soccer match. Do you work at the pool too? -Not like that, work on my tan. Is Rakel checking out the new Spanish goalkeeper? I don't know. Can you help me out? Sorry, the sun fades so fast in the afternoon. You just have to hitchhike. ...risky betting on age. -I just don't agree. What is Rakel doing here? She probably want's a Tommi Dog for lunch. Have fun! Hi, how are you? -Fine. What are you doing here? -Wanna join me for lunch? Sure, we just finished. Tommi. -Yes. I've been thinking about our relationship. Yes. -And... I'm think we should take a break. What? A break? I thought we were all good? Yes, but situations have changed. Changed? Didn't you just drag me to the Westfjords? Yes... I still care deeply for you and we're quite compatible. But... I've fallen out of love with you. Are you kidding me? So... Are we gonna live together, but not be together? No. Linda og Halli have a room here in Bolungarvík, if you want. Linda and Halli? Are you kicking me out right now? I'm not gonna live at your aunt's! You could ask Finni or Kiddi. I barely know them. Kiddi is a total weirdo and Finni... he definitely has brain damage. He's a bit different but he's jolly. So what do I do with all my stuff? It's all in the trunk, you can take it now if you want. Once the sheep brawn is on, we bring the magic. Courtesy of uncle Bjarni. What's his problem? What about just as a camp counselor? No openings? Can you call if anything opens up? Just e-mail? Yes... OK. Bye. Is the rake wreaking havoc? Piss off! I am so fed up with your lazy ass! You never do anything accept dump all the work on me! Kiddi... Sorry about earlier. I just lost it. Please... Don't worry about it. So... Do you wanna talk about it? Yeah... Rakel just broke up with me. Said she wants to take a break, but I know what that means. Slut. You want some? No, I quit. And what? Did she say why? No, just that she wasn't sure. Not sure? Didn't she drag you over here? Yeah, exactly. What's wrong with her? What are you going to do? Go back to Reykjavík? I can't... I just spoke to the job center, there is nothing available. Not even as a camp counselor. What are you going to do? Just stay here? I have to. I just can't believe I'm stuck at Bolungarvík. "In Bolungarvík"! You wouldn't say "At Reykjavík". Where are you gonna stay? -I have no idea. Rakel said her aunt had a spare room... there is no way I'm staying there. Not in a million years. Could I maybe crash at your place? Just until I get a job back south. Good morning. -Good morning. Dude, didn't you shower? -No, Tómas... I don't shower naked with other nude men. Man, this is gonna be sweet. Everything will be fine. -I guess so. And don't listen to mom if she's nagging. If you wanna fry eggs and bacon after a night out... go right ahead. -OK. Thanks for saving my ass. -Sure thing. Forget about Rakel. She's used to breaking the hearts of good men. You're not the first. -Yeah? She's like the mink, just hunts for fun. Vicious creature. Okay... She was always nice to me. The mink is also cute, but you don't want it in a chicken coop. What are you babbling about? It doesn't make any sense. You'll get it one day. Now it's time to wipe your ass, get a tan and get drunk tonight. I guess so. -You know it. I would also buy a new car. That heals all wounds. -Yeah? I might sell mine. -Should I buy it? No, you don't want a Japanese sardine can. You want American muscle. -Okay... Boys! Did you fertilize the 8th green? What was that Kjartan? Did you fertilize the green on the 8th hole? No, we haven't done that. Do it immediately! Okay. -Tommi! Yeah. -What the hell? What? -If Kjartan asks, you don't say no. We're not done. -He doesn't know. If he asks, you just say yes and we do it later. I didn't know that. Oh no, not him. Who's that? -Þröstur Örn Shitzen. Look at that toaster. -Isn't it an electric car? Yeah, he's a total tool. He's a conservation something. He always ruins everything we do. Come, I don't wanna meet him. Does the fertilizer reflect the sun rays back on me? What is he lubing up with? -He's always experimenting. Now it's cooking oil. -You're kidding! Finni. -Yeah? Have you tried fish oil? -No, is that good? Works like a charm. It penetrates the skin and gives a deeper tan. Okay... Doesn't it smell bad? No. -And it's rich in vitamin D, so it sucks the tan into the skin. Okay. I gotta try that. -Yeah, I think you should. Can we get a bottle? -Sure. These mountains are amazing. Is it on the green? -You know it. Do you feel like topping that? Why haven't they mowed this? Dammit. Son of a bitch! Bollocks. The course is way to easy guys. We're getting pucks that haven't held a club before, parring every hole. The guys from GSÍ will mock us, it's like a practice course. They'll go straight to Ísafjörður. We gotta make it more difficult. -How do we do that? It's just not punishing. -On the 4th for example. The pucks drive over the rough, onto the green and even get an ace! We can't have people getting an albatross so easily. What's albatross? -Giant seagull. Three under par. -My grandfather told me that they're sacred. They represent the souls of lost sailors. -Hogwash. What the hell is this? You look like a greased up hippo! Why don't you just practice so you can do it too? -Shut up! We can't allow people to lower their handicap like shooting fish in a barrel. -What do you wanna do? Well... We'll put a board in front of the tee on the 4th. so they can't hit straight to the green. Then we build a stone wall behind the 8th green. for a real punishment if people overshoot. Why not put a crocodile in the rough and an old pervert in the bunker? Shut it, hippo! Do it first thing tomorrow. This is bullshit! Kiddi, help us! And it's just unsafe when the balls bounce off it. This is unbelievable... He wants a huge board in one place and a big ditch at another. And the excessive use of fertilizer is beyond me. There are other brands that are much better and more efficient. Didn't he make you use horse manure? -Yes, he wants shit on everything. Horses eat more than grass, for example flowers and weeds. And the seeds go undigested through the animal. So it comes as no surprise to have chickweed all over the greens. How do you know so much about this? I studied biochemistry in St. Andrews in Scotland and researched plants along my doctoral studies. Doctor... What are you doing on a loader? I got bad hay fever when I was doing my thesis. They offered me a job at St. Andrews golf course but I couldn't accept because of the allergy. Soon after, I met my wife who is from the Westfjords. Haven't you been able to work on this here? No, not really. I've written some articles on plants, but I do fine on the loader. What do you get for this? -A one year membership. One year? -Indeed. You can charge Kjartan way more. -Perhaps. But look... Our house is paid off and the kids are grown up. My fisherman friends give me fresh fish. We grow potatoes and cabbage in the garden. So money has little value to me. -Little value? The only reason I'm doing this crap, is money! If I buy a new car, I need a loan, which means I owe the bank more money, and have to do more crappy jobs. If you let the fear of financial scarcity control your life you'll get stuck in situations and jobs that you will hate. You have to reset your compass, and find out what you truly wanna do. Then you have a life course and if you maintain it you will become good at it and you'll love what you do. There is always need for people who love what they do. Only then can you fearlessly live your life. And also be ready to leave anytime. The one who lives his life to the fullest, can die happily. Do you want to work the loader? -I like it. Just as long as I get to see my wife every day. What are you doing? -Firing up the grill. Not with my mail! Just use toilet paper. Kiddi finished it. Why can't I burn that? That's for my tuition. Just use Kjartan's whiskey. Good morning. -Morning. Where do you want it? -Just over here. Are you new? -Yeah, I've been here for a few weeks. Okay... Are you still using that? Is that a problem? -That... That's turdilizer. Okay. Are you a local? -No, from Reykjavík. Okay... What brings you here? I came with my girlfriend. Oh, who is she? Her name is Rakel. Rakel... from Bolungarvík? No, from Ísafjörður. Jónsdóttir. Okay... Daughter of Jón, the trucker? -Yes. Do you know her? -Sure I do. I've been working for her dad for ages. -Okay. I thought you'd be darker. -What? You're on the soccer team, right? Soccer? No, why do you think so? Oh... It's been trying to rain all morning. Stop changing the subject, what did you mean? The grill is ready. Shut up, why do you think I play soccer? The word around the shop is that she's dating some Latino footballer. Are you serious? You knew about this? -What? Is Rakel dating some soccer guy? -The Spanish goalkeeper? She's dating him? Don't ask me. Maybe Kiddi knows something. Kiddi? -No, I... Tell me! Do you know something? Just tell me. Steini at the shop said he saw her car a couple of times outside the soccer flats, where the foreign players live. You can't be serious. Is that shop just the mecca of tittle-tattle? I wouldn't take it too seriously. So... See you guys later. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic... Tommi. -Óli? Hey man. -What's up? What brings you here? -We're testing the course. Are you with GSÍ? -Yes, just started. So I'll be golfing all summer. -Awesome. Are you still using this fertilizer? -Yeah. Keilir is using a much better one. -Really? Yeah, I'll make sure you get a couple of bags. Tómas, don't disturb the gentlemen. This is Óli, he works with my dad. Is that so? Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything. Let's make a fresh pot of coffee and some waffles for the fellows. Sure. See ya. What the hell are you doing here? Simply playing a round of golf. You don't golf here unless you're a member. I just paid for a single round. Let me be absolutely clear. If you so much as think about weaseling your way into hosting the county tournament... I will destroy you, once and for all. Look who's mouthing off today. We'll just see who will host the tournament. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. What is that? Firstly, thanks for the warm welcome. Especially for the mustard-bacon pancakes. And for the course, I think it's in pretty decent condition. But on the 4th and 8th hole... The board and the wall... What's that? Well... The gang and I are always pondering... how to do better... and we thought of... creating some obstacles, because... the course was a bit easy, to make it more demanding. Yeah, but the wall on the 8th is just a hazard. Well, that's no problem... the boys just dismantle it tomorrow. Okay. I'll return a week before the tournament. And if the obstacles are gone and the course in the same shape. Then I see nothing preventing you from hosting. If not, then Þrándur is willing to take over. One more thing. The rules state that you must have a driving range. Where is yours? It can't be done. -Don't pussy out! There's one behind you. Look out! It's impossible! -No, we'll just have an omelet feast. It pecks you bloody. I'm not doing this. Never mind the tern and the nests, the area is just ruined. Because of Kjartan's manure. Kjartan said it's just a formality, no one is gonna use it. No one? This man is unbelievable. Even if GSÍ wouldn't need it, it just can't be mowed. Good morning. -Good morning. What are you doing here? -Just looking around. With mowing equipment? -No, we're just trimming the roadside. Kjartan and I have a peace treaty for the area. The tern has to lay it's eggs. -Did Kjartan say that? We negotiated an annual fee for the bird-watching club and instead the tern is left alone. -The tern stole it from us. There's plenty of area for it to relocate. Nature always comes first, especially regarding adult playgrounds. Is that clear? There's been an eagle in the area, but it may be gone... Maybe put the handbrake on? Which may be gone... because of your screaming combustion motors. I can only watch it a night. I don't care about some eagle that gets you off at night. We're trying to take pictures, but we can't because you apes can't adapt to nature. We're mowing for the tournament. -Hell no, I'm talking to Kjartan. Give him my best. -See ya. Now what? This isn't our fight. Let's go, I'm hungry. Can I get a ride? -No, walk with Tommi. I'll sit here. -Get the hell of! No Finni, Tranny is a girl with a penis. Like a strap-on? -Sure, if you want... What filth are you watching? -Not me, Steini. Guys, what's going on there? -Finni! Is that a car on the forks? -It's Þröstur's car. Has Kjartan completely all lost it? -This will be fun. What the hell are you doing? -Putting the heap on the box. Are you crazy? -I told you to stop bitching. Bitching? -Yes! We had a treaty for the tern. -The situation has changed. You can't say that now. -Yes! No! You can't. Lower the car or I'll call the cops. -Maybe call the whambulance? Damn nature communists. There's no living with you. Go home! Is Þröstur as crazy as Kjartan? -He's an idiot. It'd be funny if the car fell off. -They'd both deserve that. Would he pay for it? -Never, he's an asshole. Only shrimp salad? -Kiddi is crazy for it. Didn't he poop before lunch? Mustard on a cinnamon roll...? Don't be shy... You have to scoop it properly. What just happened? -What? When you came out. -I was getting a new roll. Naked? -I was pooping. You poop naked? -Yeah... do you not? Well, bottomless, but not completely naked. Doesn't the sweater brush your asshole when you wipe? No, I stand up to wipe. -You wipe standing up? Of course, do you not? -No, I sit and go through the front. The front? -Like a girl? Most people wipe from behind. Don't you smear it all over your balls? No, I tuck them in. -What kind of position is that? I met one the other day, who always wipes on his knees. Like doggy style? -Yeah, I guess so. I met another one by the docks who always spits in the paper. Do you just ask random people how they wipe? They just seem eager to discuss it. -Because you're always pooping. Why did he spit in it? That's just disgusting. No idea... Savings trick? Wipe better if the poop is dry. Who skimps when he wipes? -Do you just tear through it? No, I just roll it like this. -What? I use two squares and fold for multiple wipes. Two? How long does a roll last? -Like a pack of butter. About four days? -Four days?! No, closer to a month. You're like a girl. When I lived with Rakel, the rolls just vanished! They gotta do the front bottom too. -Front bottom? Are you five? But what is the deal? Do they all have chronic diarrhea? You really think that Beyonce has the shits all day? At least the toilet never smells when they're done. What are they doing in there if not pooping? How should I know? -They never even admit that they fart. No Finni, they don't... -Have you ever heard one fart? Tómas, now I'll get the perfect tan. -Yeah, you're borderline black... Tommi. You wanna hit? Is it the Turkish one? -Yes. Tommi, did you hear me? What were you doing in Costa Rica? Oh yeah... I met a guy in New York. He said it was just the place to be. I went to learn Spanish and do volunteer work. Nice... So you were just fed up with the IT business? Yeah, it made sense to... get a degree and find a well paid job. It just sucks, working in an office. When were you in Norway? -The year after. Norwegians... aren't they just a bunch of idiots? They're alright. Taught me to paraglide. -Para what? Paraglide... "Glide wing flying" in Icelandic. It's similar to flying a parachute... except you fly off a mountain instead of a plane. Are you doing that? -Yeah, or at least I was, in Norway. Isn't it awesome? -Totally. I was completely hooked on it. I even stopped partying. Flew every day I could. Wow man, have you tried it here? Not really, but the mountains are really tempting. Do you have the gear? -Yeah, it's the big bag in your garage. Lets go! Just land by the boats. Or in the ocean and swim back? -Yeah, that works too. No, I think the other side is better. I also need headwind and it's blowing this way. In Skálavík? -I don't know the names. What are you doing? -You're not leaping off this. Come on you moron. Are we there yet? -Just a little bit further. I have to see into the valley, if I can land. My feet hurt from walking. Isn't it dangerous? Not really. -Not really? Has no one died doing this? -Yeah, but that's not common. This looks much better. It's easy to land in the valley. I'm not sure about the wind though. -You just said you needed wind. Yeah, but not quite so much. -Much? You know a plastic bag flies much higher if there is more wind. How is that comparable? I'm not flying with a plastic bag. Although, it's probably doable. A dirty text from Kjartan? No, it's Rakel. I'm gonna go and meet her. -What?! You're not gonna jump? -Nope. No, it's windy and... come on. Are you kidding me? Tommi! -Come. Tommi! What did she say? She confessed to being with someone else. Was it the footballer? The Spaniard? She wouldn't say. Just said it was over. Poor guy. The football chicks are here. They're pretty attractive. Tell me about it. Look at the brown one. Go talk to them. -Me? Yeah. -No. Take Tommi with you instead. -Yeah maybe. What are you doing? You gotta bring the ends closer. It's not nearly tight enough. Look, you have to tighten... You're such a dick. -Thanks for sharing. Did you see the football chicks planting flowers? -No. We gotta mingle with them. Warm up for the dance tonight. They'll be there. -I'm in no mood. Come on... -No. There is a foreign one. Kiddi, where is she from? Brazil. -Yeah, you speak Brazilian right? There is no such thing. -Or, you know... Spanish...? -Do you mean Portuguese? Tommi, stop it. Look. She's pretty good looking. -Yeah. Where are the other girls? Probably squandering all of our toilet paper. Are you up for mingling? -No, you go. I'm in no mood. Not by my self. I failed English and my lip is stuffed. Yeah, because you stole my tobacco. Take Kiddi with you. What? No... -Yeah, I'm going brush cutting. Tommi? -Kiddi, get ready. You think I'm gonna come out smelling like roses? No, you don't have to plant flowers. Just mingle a little. You're the fastest baiter in town. We can work with that. That's never gonna work. Hello. -Hi. You putting flowers? -Yes. What's your name? -Maria. And yours? Finnbogi... or "El Fernando" This is Kiddi cowboy. You from Brasilía? -Yes, I'm from Brazil. Wax and coffee. Pelé. -Pelé and... cocaine. And Kiddi he is the best... you know... How do you say bait a bucket? "Bait a bale". -No, that can't be right. Well, "bait" is definitely right. OK. Yes, he's a "masterbaiter". -What?! The best in town. He can teach you. -Teach me to masturbate? Yes, he's the fastest in Bolungarvík. Just forty-five minutes. You can't even see his hands, they move so fast. -Okay... Oh well... truck with poison is here. Greetings boys. -Good morning. New fertilizer! -Yeah. You finally came to your senses. Do you realize what you just said? -Shut up. What are you numb nuts up to? Hi. -Hey. What's going on? -I can't list all the steps, but it began in the big bang. -What? The new fertilizer just arrived from Keilir. Keilir? A crappy club. What's special about this? It's just much better, we only need half of the amount. Bullshit! You'll use the same amount. Óli said... -Óli cannoli has no power here! You go now and put the same amount on all the greens. Then you return tonight to mow them. -You're kidding?! No! The contest starts at eight a.m. -There is a dance tonight. I don't give a rats ass. You'll also mow the driving range, because Óli comes on Tuesday. And you have to do it at night so Þröstur can't interfere. Look! We're... -Don't you "look" me! Either do this or you're fired! I'm not missing the dance. -What about the range and the greens? We'll do it after the dance. -No way. We have to, or else we'll get fired. So... could you unload the bed? You wanna go for a booze run? Yeah. We must fertilize the greens. We'll do it afterwards. -I agree. Where is your car Finni? -Just at the next farm. What is it doing there? Have you completely lost it Finni? -Never better. How much did this cost you? -Just a couple of signatures. You think that's gonna charm the football chicks? Alright ladies... strap in. There's no seat belt in the back! We're not doing this. Just finish it. -No. No one's gonna know. -Everybody knows everything at Bolungarvík. The whole Westfjords knows Rakel did some footballer. Shut up Kiddi! -Let's just do it. It's just Kjartans problem. If you do this, I'm gone. Don't hurt the birds! -No, guys. Get off. I'm going home if you do it. -I don't care. It's a couple of nests. -And hatchlings, you'll kill them. Piss off! Finni! Finni! Stop Finni! Oh hell no, I don't believe this. Finni stop it! Watch out Finni! Stop the mower you baboon! Leave him alone. Get off him! What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Finni stop it! Calm down Finni. Calm down. Stop it guys. Relax. -Easy! Yes. -We're not mowing the area. You promise? -Yes. Stop it. Are you calm? -Yes, cool as ice. Yes, cut it out. -Relax. Shake hands. Make peace. Just like this. We're good. Bird molester. Are you mental? -A hole in one for Þröstur. What's your problem? -I will report this to the authorities! Finni? Finni! God damn it. That's a shame. They didn't skimp on the fertilizer. I better report this. Hello. Speaking. What? Come here, I'll show you. I told you again and again, half the amount. it says here, in capital letters: TURBOKALK. Half the amount! You shouldn't have switched. The greens are all scorched. Because you demanded the same amount. I never wanted this poison. -Why did you accept it? Because you and your city leeches forced me to. -Forced? That's on you!. -Shut your mouth. Are you insane? -Are you questioning my sanity? Do you want my analysis? -Guys! Calm down. Silence you sloth. Because of you we lost the tournament to Ísafjörður. How did they know so soon? -How should I know? It doesn't take a genius to realize that the course is ruined. That's not on us! -Shut your pie hole. You're fired! You're all fired! -No, I gotta make payments you stupid cunt! You think I give a shit? -Guys! Guys! Kjartan, are you crazy? Leave him alone. Get off him! Tobacco? Paper? The bank is gonna take the mustang. -Can't you get another job? At the fish factory. But Kjartan works there too, so I guess not. It's gonna be alright. I'm just gonna head back to Reykjavík. The football chicks are here! Kiddi, there's one for you, with huge knockers. Weren't they at the dance last night? No, I forgot they had a match today. Tommi look! The brown girl is with them. No way I'm going. -You did great last time. No, shut up! Go talk to her. You speak a bunch of languages. Take the tobacco. -I have one. You're lip is always stuffed anyway. Hello. -Hello. You speak Spanish? Yeah, a little bit. How are you doing? -Fine, how about you? Fine. What's your name? -Maria. What a pretty name. Do you know my buddy „El Fernando“? Yes, I do. I haven't spoken Spanish for a while. Can we talk in English? Sure. What's your name? -My name is Tommi. Nice to meet you Tommi. -Nice to meet you Maria. You play football, right? -Yes. How was the game today? It was alright. Tough, but we won. Did you score? No, I'm one of the goalkeepers. -OK, that's cool. How long have you been in Iceland? -About three months. Do you have a boyfriend here? -No, not really. How about in Brazil? -No, no boyfriends at all. Can I buy you a drink? -I already ordered, I'm just waiting. Can I get a beer? -Relax buddy, I'm taking care of her. Thank you. I don't know! What do mean? Why did you date me to begin with? I didn't know what I wanted. -What do you mean by that? You can't understand not knowing without not knowing. -What? Yes. -No! Yeah! I don't hit on guys if I have no interest in them. No, but your friends don't talk about guys and hit on guys. -No... Try to put yourself in my shoes. Why the hell did you bring me here to begin with? I just wanted to keep the peace. -Wow, thanks for a heavenly summer. Tommi, stop it. How long have you two been dating? -It doesn't matter. No? We dated, remember? -Well, that's over now. Maybe it's not as easy for me to accept that. Easy? You seriously think this has been easy for me? No... -No, I've been hiding this my whole life. I just thought we were it... you know. Well, I guess you see now that's not the case. I've completely screwed up my life. Yeah, it sucks to soil oneself. This isn't your fault. I'm just so fed up. This is so typical. At least you can get a girl. I have only been with a hooker in Benidorm, that the guys paid for. They didn't tell me until afterwards. I had to take some chlamydia-pill and got really sick. And I failed my all classes. Except one, which didn't have a final. At least you can talk to girls... in many languages too. And you're a software-something. -That doesn't matter Finni. A degree is useless if you have no passion for it. Tommi. At least you can choose something else than a crappy job. What do you think it's like, standing in the bait shack all day? In the stench, putting fish on hooks. Imagine the taste of your coffee. I'm thirty-three and I've never earned more than the minimum wage. I don't even have a computer. And I can't move away from here, buried in debt... and try to start a new life somewhere else. And I can't even get a tan. And on top of everything, the tournament will be in Ísafjörður. Good evening. -What are you doing here? Sorry for waking you but... we have to mow the practice range. Look... -Wait, let me finish. Kjartan is going to mow it. You do realize that. The bird-watching club... -He is going to mow the area. We're coming to you to ask. Is there anything we can do without killing any birds? Something everyone can accept? Well... It's early in the summer and the tern has just arrived. So technically you could move the nests over the road. Where do I put them? The greens will be good next week. We've had an expert helping us. And we have a driving range. It's not the best, but it'll do. Can you come and check it out, since you'll be in the area. Okay, thanks. Bye. What did he say? -That he'll check it out. Kjartan is here. -What the hell is going on? Rematch? -No, take it easy. Grab my beer, I'll talk to him. Kjartan! -What are you doing here? I thought I fired you. I just talked to Óli at GSÍ. -Yeah? He's coming on Tuesday. We fixed the greens. -What? And did the losers also help? Thanks. -Just a few drops. If it all works out... and we get the tournament back... then Bárður is getting a life time membership. Yeah, I think that's long overdue. Has this feud between the clubs always existed? -No... Well, the past twenty-six years. Really? I thought it had always been? -No... The guys from Ísafjörður have their ways of doing things... and we in Bolungarvík are like we are. It's just a typical rivalry. What happened 26 years ago? It all started... when Þrándur was elected president. Have you guys always been enemies? -Yes, you could say that. Why? Did he sleep with your wife? Yes. Are you kidding? No... Þrándur is a savage. I realized it soon after he moved here. He didn't hesitate to try his luck with married women. Whether it was at work or backstage at a dance. Was he in a band? -He was a guitarist in a... Duran Duran tribute band, that played back in the days. One time... I lost my Sigrún and... couldn't find her. Looked everywhere. When the dance was over and they turned on the lights... I just went to get my jacket and... there she was, fornicating with Þrándur. The swine just casually greeted me. That bastard. Soon after... Sigrún left me. And moved with him to Ísafjörður. He joined their club and quickly became president. Weren't you in a band as well? No... I wouldn't exactly say that. I was a roadie for a Wham cover band. That's life guys. Somehow... I never managed to... get out of the fish factory. I'd probably still have a mullet, if the hair wasn't thinning. When I come here to Syðridalur... I forget all my worries and troubles. I don't know what I would do without the course. Looking good... Let's see if the ball rolls properly. Yeah... it's pretty decent. I've seen a better driving range... but nobody really uses them anyway. I must say, it's all good and the tournament is yours. Did you buy lighter fluid? -No. Did you finish the toilet paper as well? I think there was one roll left yesterday. -Tommi! Yeah. -Bring me some toilet paper. What? -Bring toilet paper. Okay. Here, use this. -What the hell? Fire it up with that. -Isn't it the same as last time? Yes, can't you see that? -Yeah. I won't be needing it. Are you sure? -Yes. Positive? -Yeah, are we gonna eat today or what? Last chance. -Yeah, burn it. Are you certain? -Incinerate it you moron! So, Tommi? What's next for you? I have no idea... I will find something, I have all summer to figure it out. What is it? -Just look. A package? For me? -Yeah. Dude, I got it. -It's not complicated. In Bolungarvík, in Reykjavík, in... At Dalvík, at Hólmavík, at... You got it? -Yes, I got it. Are you satisfied? -I'm satisfied. I'll make sure to bring this the next time I'm at Bolungarvík. You moron. -I'm messing with you. How about you Kiddi, what's the plan? I don't know... I was gonna go back to baiting... but I just can't. I understand. Sounds disgusting. You'll find something. Why don't you ask Bárður? That's a great idea. Yeah... That's not a bad idea. So Finni... how is it cooking? You're getting some gourmet steaks. -Where do you find these recipes? Finni doesn't find, Finni just formulates himself. Also the mayo-oregano rhubarb-marinade? -Yeah. Why don't you study to be a cook? -Study? I am the kook. If you study it you can just do it professionally. I can't study. I have dyslexia and ADD. That doesn't matter... They don't care if you fail the theory if you can cook. Really? -Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I would do it if I was you. -Yeah. Then you can always invite me to dinner. -Yes. So I don't have to cook. -Maybe I will. Every day? -Every single day. Here's to the summer. -Cheers. Be careful! Do a trick. Are we picking him up? -I don't know. What should we do now? -Maybe... a round of golf? Yeah, I have barely played all summer. Do you have the keys? -Me? No. Tommi! You have the keys! Tommi! -Turn around! Dammit, Finni... You gotta call your mom and ask her to pick us up. Oh, I don't have any credit left. Crap! Why have a cell if you don't have any credit? -Shut up!
