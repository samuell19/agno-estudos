So, as you all know, the State Assembly elections are just around the corner. And with the restrictions on the sale and transport of cattle, there's tension in the air. It would be intriguing to watch how the government handles this situation. -Will this affect the elections? -Play Jazz. -Long live… -Vicky Bana! -Long live… -Gyaan Singh! -Long live… -Vicky Bana! As you can see, Rashtriya Vikas Dal's rally led by Vikram Singh is passing through the Butcher's Lane in full swing. Keep calm! Keep calm! How long can we keep calm? We requested them to at least leave our faith and our belief alone. We pleaded with them. But if somebody mistakes our tolerance for impotence, then how can we keep calm? -Long live… -Vicky Bana! -Long live… -Gyaan Singh! After the recent alliance for power, we are seeing a new aspect of the Rashtriya Vikas Dal. By looking at the attitude on display here, one can easily say that this is not just a rally, but a display of power. -Long live… -Gyaan Singh! -Long live… -Vicky Bana! -Long live… -Hold on, listen to me… Hey! Who is pelting stones?! Breaking news! Vicky Singh just got attacked. The crowd here has suddenly turned aggressive and started pelting stones at the rally! And who started this violence will remain debatable for the next few days. This bid to instill fear has been given a befitting reply. How badly are you hurt, Vicky? As you can see, Vicky Singh had to make a hasty retreat from his own rally! This show of strength has turned completely violent. What you see here obviously wasn't a sudden outburst. There is some kind of conspiracy behind it. There are some rumors. People here have turned into bloodthirsty monsters. But let me remind you, even in these dire circumstances, our channel is bringing this to you exclusively. -Hey, you! -Please spare me. Please… -Hit him! -Come on, hit him! Hit him! Bloody coward! What are you doing? The scorching sun, the burning barren lands. Shattered hopes and pining eyes. Every sight is fading away, yet there's nothing to worry about. T-Oasis Telecom is your companion. In every journey. Please welcome the man himself. The adman. Our very own Sawalpur boy. Rahab Ahmed. Please sit down. This is complete nonsense. This was the first ad that the agency I started developed. And this bullshit changed my life. If you believe in bad stories, you'll end up getting hurt. Have you guys read Kabir? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. "So what if you're as tall as the date palm tree…" You can say this, and so can you. All of us can. Good stories… good poems and good commercials are those with rationale. Something that provokes you. Why? You have to ask why! Therefore, Kabir goes on to say… "No shade for the weary traveler, and the fruit is too far to reach." Sir, why did you come back when things were going your way in America? Yes, things were going my way. My English wasn't perfect, but I was getting along alright. Actually… people there didn't mind my accent as much as they do here. -Yes. -No, honestly. Honestly. So, this one time in New York… I was taking the subway to work. An Indian uncle was sitting in front of me, with his grandson. A couple of hooligans boarded at the next stop. And out of the blue, they started heckling the Indian uncle. I cannot repeat their exact words here, but what they essentially meant to say was… "This is not your country! Go back!" At first, I thought I should move to the next compartment. But then it hit me… that I should do something. So, I took out my mobile phone and started recording their behavior. Watching me record them, they started yelling at me. "What the fuck man! What are you doing?!" "Stop recording! Stop recording!" But then something amazing happened. Another passenger took his phone out and started recording. Eventually, the entire compartment was recording their behavior. Trust me… they were left with no choice. They covered their faces and got off at the next stop. But then I realized… that the scumbags were actually right. What was I doing out there? Sometimes even scumbags make sense. So, instead of being a second-class citizen in a first-world country, it's better to make small efforts towards making the lives of our own people better. So, here I am. All hail Gyaan Singh! Come on, let's go! All hail Gyaan Singh! You're late, sir. Master is asleep. Vikram Singh's speech at the Rashtriya Vikas Dal's rally was highly provocative. No one expected such fervor from this rapidly rising youth leader. We cannot show you what happened behind this closed shutter. When the shutter opened, the butcher's lifeless body was lying on the floor. And next to it was his sobbing wife. Her eyes wondering… what his fault was. And the person you see here is… SLEAZEBALL What do you want? Sawalpur is all over the news, Nivi. There are 340,000 mentions of your fiancé on that video. So? So, you'll just dump one sleazeball and marry another? Just fuck off, Ritesh! Just pick a caterer, will you? They've been pestering me with options. Get out, everyone. Mahinder! Are you deaf? Get out! This man is seen begging and pleading for his life. There are several rumors about him. Did Chandan Singh murder him brutally? What are you researching? Or is Vikram Singh's provocative speech responsible for his death… "Rising bigotry in Sawalpur." What's going on, Vicky? -What are you doing? -Enough! -Shut this! -What else can you shut down? Can you shut down Qwitter? The bloody social media is in a frenzy, Vicky. I'm getting calls from Delhi with questions, and I have nothing to say because this is so damn horrifying! That guy was pleading for his life! Fuck! This is so fucked up. So wrong. Why are we answerable to a bunch of self-styled activists sitting in Delhi? Because my fiancé is the future deputy leader of the party. Do you get it? Come on, Nivi. Some things are beyond our control. You know it. What do you mean some things are beyond our control? A man is dead! How does it happen? Please explain it to me. I was there to give a speech! -I did not mean it. -Please. This is all an act. -Of course. -You know it. And what do your friends know about Sawalpur? They know this, Vicky! What were you telling Chandan here? HAS VICKY BANA GIVEN CHANDAN A LOT OF LEEWAY? RUMORS HAVE BEGUN CIRCULATING Nothing. Vicky, I can see all your fucking boys here. I can see the faces of all your bloody cronies! Ishaan, Monty, Bhanwar, and that fucking Chandan! Are you trying to tell me that these boys in the video are not them? That none of these boys are responsible for what happened? -Nivi. -Get lost! Nivi, stop it! That's enough. Why should I stop? You asked me what my friends know about Sawalpur, and I'm showing you what my friends and all of India knows about Sawalpur. Then go ask your own father first! He formed the alliance. This rally was his idea. This was done to show our partners that we are with them. It was supposed to be peaceful. -They flung the first stone. -So? You'll kill them for that? -Sister-in-law, Vicky did not-- -Please just get out of here! Please ask him to leave. Jai. I didn't get anyone killed. I explicitly warned Chandan. But he's a bloody buffoon! What am I supposed to do? Then get that bloody buffoon arrested. That's what you're supposed to do. Do what's fucking right! Get him arrested. You know what? You are a coward. -You are a bloody-- -Don't fucking cross the line! Don't. Your dad. Yes, sir. I saw your speech. It was a very small task. You just had to rally some support in favor of the ban. Papa, we were supposed to uphold the honor of this alliance. And that's what I'm doing. My stand has been clear since day one. The single point agenda of the alliance is development… not to cause riots. You sound like news reporters now. You're the one who taught me that some ideals have to be sacrificed. We'll do a press conference after I get discharged. Until then, confer with Tomar about Chandan Singh. You'll need to make some sacrifices as well. Papa, Chandan is one of my most loyal men from our erstwhile fiefdom. He's been around since my dad's time. And I've been enjoying Ramadan feasts in that neighborhood for 40 years now. I know we control the state government, but not all of it. Sooner or later, our partners can use this against us. Think like a politician, not like a Feudal lord. Sir. Excuse me, sir. You wanted to talk to Inspector Tomar. He's on the line. -Yes? -Greetings, sir! I told you that buffoon would screw us eventually. -But you-- -Then do what's necessary. And tell your Vicky Bana… that those were my orders. Sir! Yes, Papa? This new alliance has the full backing of the new power in the center. Fixed MSP on millet. Demands for new dams and roads. Things that had been pending for the last 26 years are now happening. Yes. It's very easy to cuss a politician. But what is a politician? We are just a reflection of the people. Yes. Stop saying yes to everything like your mom! People's hearts are filled with violence and bigotry. They want this-- Hi. Have you reached? Good morning. I'm about to reach. How are you? I'm good. You're looking nice! Thank you for noticing. Did you have a word with your dad? When is he coming? No, you talk to him. Please. Here, talk to her. Yes, dear. Why did you shave your beard, Dad? My friend shaved it off while I was asleep! Tell her, Hanspal! Explain yourself! Your father-in-law just can't do without fresh meat. Every day he saunters off towards Gol Gate. So, before someone else chops something else off, I chopped off his beard. Okay, Dad, I've got to go. Yeah, I'll see you. -Okay, dear. -Yes. Rahab, listen. Just call me when you're on your way here. Okay? WELCOME Look, he's scared stiff! Look, Jai. Isn't that the sound of his asshole getting ripped? Show it to him. His video has gone viral. I had some tea on an empty stomach. So, it's acid reflux-- -Stop farting! -Acid reflux… -Hey, bring the snacks. -Snacks? -Get some antacids. -Antacids? It wasn't him. Stop saying it was him. Do one thing. Swear on your mother that it wasn't you. Why should I swear on my mother? -Just swear that it wasn't you. -I won't swear on my mother! Look, a peacock! Look, it's ripped! -Stop it! -Let me see. -I said stop it! -Come on. Assholes! -Who's shitting their pants now? -What the fuck are you doing? -Assholes! Are you shitting bricks now? -What are you doing? -Ishaan, listen to me… -How's that asshole of yours doing now? We are bros, aren't we? You are a party worker… not a hooligan. Take it. Greetings. -My grandson-- -Come in. God bless you. Chandan is on the line. Chandan, where are you? Bana, I'm celebrating… in advance. The pitch is set… you just have to play the innings of a lifetime. Our days of taking orders are over. By the way, what did Hukum say? What ministry is he offering you? This man is seen begging and pleading for his life. There are several rumors about him. So… what did Hukum say? Nothing special. Gyaan Singh said you shouldn't have let them make a video. How else were we supposed to make a mountain out of a molehill? Take advantage of the situation, Bana. Terrorize those bastards so much that they are forced to cast their votes for you. Put the fear of God in them! Listen, lie low for a couple of-- Yes, I know. I'm lying low at your farmhouse for a couple of days. The farmhouse? Who else is there with you? It's just me. Meditating. So, I can paint the town red when I get out of here! I've even come up with a slogan. "Vikram Singh will bring justice. The others will rest in peace!" The person you see here is Chandan Singh. It's being said that he is Vicky's close aide… Welcome to the Annual Police Day function. We'll kick off the ceremony with medal distribution. The first winner of the Shoorvir Medal of 2022 is… Inspector Sandeep Kumar Tomar. SHO Sadar Police Station, Sawalpur. DGP Murli Menon will now honor him with this medal. How many so far, Tomar? It's the fourth one, sir. By your grace. Those were Vikram Singh's men in Butcher's Lane, weren't they? We are investigating, sir. Tomar, if I'm able to fix you before retirement… I'll have no regrets. Come on, sir. Even you've started believing in rumors. I'll take care of everything, sir. What are you staring at him for? He's not going to marry you. Next is the Union Home Minister's medal of the year. -And it goes to… -Yes, Bana. You've got this job in the sports quota. Be in Tomar's good books. You'll go a long way. No. No. To hell with the bloody alliance, and to hell with Gyaan Singh! No matter what he says, you won't kill Chandan. -No! -Bana, please. I will do exactly as you say. But just hear me out first. Please. The DGP is retiring. All of a sudden, the moron has grown a conscience. He's got an entire profile on Chandan. Chandan has to die. You're the future party leader, Bana. Please think about your future. He's at the farmhouse. I'll send you the location. We'll take Chandan's body to his hometown. Make sure his family doesn't find out until then. Two and a half hours to Nahargarh Fort Hotel. You are on the fastest route. Hi. Hey! How are you? I'm fine. How's the Lit-Fest coming along? -How is the wine? -Old. But quite nice actually. I met some really interesting authors. Don't worry, also old. The answer to all of the country's problems is in your book. Tell those old folks to focus on the book, not you. Have you even read my book? Well, anyway, I'm running late. I got to go. What springs to mind is a phrase by Benedict Anderson… that a nation is an imagined community. Rahab, this is looking very rude. I have to go. Okay? When are you getting here? There's a saying. "Once you're on the way, focus on the journey, not the destination." She's an educated girl. She's bound to use her head. Dear, Papa. If I'm running away, then somewhere you're also responsible. You said you always treated me like a son. But if there was any truth in it, you wouldn't be marrying me off to any random guy. I came back home because I had a breakup. Was I a liability to you? You said I should support Vicky. But for how long? You know what he's heading for. I can't be with him. So, I'm leaving. Once you return home after your surgery, we'll talk from wherever I am. Congestion ahead. Congestion ahead. Recalculating time to destination. There is a faster alternate route available to Nahargarh Fort Hotel via Sawalpur. Turn around. And take the first exit onto Sawalpur Road. You are now on the fastest route to Nahargarh Fort Hotel. SAWALPUR Yeah, tell me. Be right there. They found her. She's at Ghanta Ghar. Move, you idiot! Move! This is not a parking lot, sir! Parked bang in the middle of the road! Sister-in-law, please. Come back home. Please. Sister-in-law, please. -Please let's go. -I'm not your sister-in-law! -Get lost, you rascal! -Hey! Stay back! Bhanwar, wait a minute. Let me handle this. Wait a minute. Please hear me out. -What? -Vicky Bana-- What?! That idiot can't handle a single girl! You seem amused! Don't you dare get smart with me! Come on. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away! -Please. -Get lost! Hey! -Has the cat got your tongues? Assholes! -Stay away! -Keep requesting sister-in-law. -Please… Don't let her get away. Sister-in-law, hear me out. Please. Let's go. How the fuck did you touch me?! Fucking asshole! -How the fuck did you touch me, asshole?! -Listen to me! Stay away! Asshole means the hole of the butt. -Everyone's watching, sister-in-law. -Let me go! -Bhanwar! I told you not to-- -It's not my fault. She's bleeding. -Does it hurt a lot? -Excuse me! What are you doing? Leave her alone. Hey, mind your own business! -She's bleeding. -Let go! Let me go! What a bunch of shameless people! A girl is getting publicly attacked, and you guys are just watching? She's Gyaan Singh's daughter, you morons! -Don't intervene. -Let her go! Hey, back off! Mind your own business. Take your phones out. Record their behavior. Teach them a lesson. We're ten times the number they are. Record them now! Get your phones out. -You're bleeding… -Sister-in-law… -Sister-in-law, please. -Let go of me! -Monty. -Yes? Take his phone. Take his phone! Don't you understand? You scoundrel! Ishaan, hide sister-in-law's face. We have a reputation out here. Don't you get it?! I've been trying to tell you… -Bhanwar! -Wait! I'll teach you a lesson! -Fuck! -Bhanwar, get him! -Catch him! -Wait, I'll show you. -Catch him! -Wait, you… I will bust your balls! Bhanwar, he's getting away! You idiot! Nivi! Nivi! Don't. Bana is requesting you, sister-in-law. Please listen to me. -Please stop, sister-in-law. -Drive! Sister-in-law… Follow them! At the next intersection, turn left. Turn left. Your itinerary is being recalculated. Please turn around. Watch out! -You're driving in the wrong direction. -Shit. Stop the car! -Please turn around and take… -Sorry. …the left turn onto Maharana Pratap Road. Stop him! -Your itinerary is being recalculated. -Take a right. -On the next intersection… -Take a right! The bridge will lead us directly to the highway. There is no bridge there. It's a mall. A mall? Since when? I'm familiar with the routes. Please turn that off. You're driving in the wrong direction. -Please turn around. -It's fine. I'll do it. Reverse the car! Yeah? Where are you? At home. Can't get out now. Her parents are here. Okay. It would've been nice if Mr. Tomar was home as well. WESTERN PROVINCE POLICE Calm down. It's alright. Fuck. Fuck. Are you okay? I shouldn't be. But I think… I'm okay. Come on, Nivi. Oh, fuck! Fuck. They are not here. WARNING WORK IN PROGRESS APOLOGIES FOR THE INCONVENIENCE Shit. Sir, let's go. Come on, we have to go. Sir, look. I know the last few minutes were very weird. But we have to run, sir. Look, my fate is already sealed. But if we get caught… they will definitely kill you. Okay? Let's go. Fuck. Goodbye, Rahab. I hope the rest of your night is delightful. Can I borrow your phone, please? Girls on the run don't carry phones. Their location can be traced. Shit, I needed to call my wife. Where the fuck are we going? We're going to a friend's place. You can call your wife from there. Oh, man! Baldie! Get your dad on the line. Bana. RASHTRIYA VIKAS DAL Yeah? It's done. Was it… I mean… Did he go peacefully? Don't worry. It was absolutely peaceful. Now you handle the rest. So why don't you contact your Dad? I'm Gyaan Singh's daughter. I'm running away from home because I didn't want to marry Vicky. But we should at least inform the police-- The police are not going to help us. The home minister is from our political party. He used to run our stables. Vicky? -Was that Vicky in the white SUV? -Yes. He has lost his mind ever since the new alliance happened. He's become nothing by a power-hungry bigot. So… what's the story going to be? They attacked our rally first. One of their men died in the riots that ensued. In return, they killed Chandan. I will perform his final rites. Wipe your tears, you idiot. Nobody in there should find out. Turn that bloody thing off. Bana, Gyaan Singh has sent someone from Delhi to manage social media. He has asked me to show you this. Nivi! Bana is requesting you, sister-in-law. Please listen to me. Drive! Drive! Come in. Guys, get out. Come on, fast. Let's get straight to the point, sir. Look at this. Listen, note down the car's registration number. I already did, sir. Rahab Ahmed. He's married. Go to this Rahab Ahmed's house and get him here. Wait, wait. Vicky, if you want to become a politician in the next generation, you have to understand the internet. Do you just want to be stuck here in local politics? Nothing more? That's too much English for one day, isn't it? Come on, let's go. Go on. How has this incident affected your image? You are a loser. Vicky, you don't need to listen to this crap. This is a man who couldn't handle his life. How will he handle the state? Sir, as soon as this video goes viral, your national career will be jeopardized. You are fucked. So, what do we do? Five lakh rupees in cash. That's not my fee, sir. It's the operating cost. I'll have to put the boys to work. If you like what you see, hire us during the elections as well. And what will your boys do? Make this video viral, sir. -Listen, smart-ass! Take this video down. -Wait, Jai. Sir, even God cannot stop this video from going viral. Look here. Just look at your face. It's so funny. There will be a bloody meme fest, sir. We must turn this disaster into an opportunity by tweaking the message of this video. #lovejihad A married Muslim man traps a Hindu woman in his deceitful web of love. And then coerced her into eloping with him. And you, the youth icon, tried to save her. And watch the magic happen, sir. Look here. Your boys are trying to save Nivi. This man pushed you… and forced Nivi to sit in the car with him. I swear on my goddamn mother, this will set the internet on fire. What about sister-in-law's reputation? She's the one who started all this. If I don't put an end to it, it'll be the end of me. -And Hukum? -What Hukum? The video has gone viral. We're just doing damage control. Exactly! And he will get the public's sympathy. "Helpless innocent father of the girl who fell prey to Love Jihad." It will be smoothly conveyed, sir. And you can even offer him your shoulder… by marrying her. Society will salute your sacrifice. From a youth icon, you'll become a savior. #homecoming Jai! Someone is trying to kill me. Leave for Doli. Doli? -What about Vicky Bana? -Just leave for Doli. Don't try to be a wise guy. Leave now! Go! How far is it to your friend's house? We are almost there. It's that manor in the front. There are people standing outside. Shall we take the back entrance? That won't be necessary. I must warn you that my friend's name is Saif. I hope you don't mind. Now you are being judgmental. I had to ask. People these days have become more sensitive. Your friend must have a phone. I really need to call my wife. Yes. Please come. How are you, Aasma? Where's Saif? You guys are early. Greetings, Uncle. Saif called me over. Saif, your friends are here. Come on, child. They are not the groom's family. -Just Saif's friends. -Nivi! For the first time, I'm glad to see your face! -What brings you here? -Don't ask, buddy. -What a day I've had! -What are you… -Can I please get some water? -Sure. Come in. -Come on. -Come on. I've been trying to call you, but you didn't answer. I called your home, and they said they don't know where you are. I am asking you something, Nivi. Do you know what's going on in the city? Section 144 has been imposed. Section 144? Why? Because of the same old rumor about beef. Some people arrived at the neighborhood butcher's shop and started arguing. Things escalated and they killed the butcher. It has sparked riots all over the city. Shops and vehicles were set on fire. Everything has closed down. -But it's just a rumor. -It is a rumor, but who cares? Neither the ones who spread it nor the ones who believe it. Who is this gentleman? Right. By the way, who are you? Rahab. -Rahab Ahmed. -What-- Rahab? What is going on, Nivi? Guys, what's the report? The message has been forwarded to more than 10,000 groups. The video views have crossed one million, sir. And now, we've started targeting the areas outside Sawalpur. Look at this, sir. The video is trending at number 7. Didn't I tell you? Now these two can't hide anywhere in India, let alone Sawalpur. I told you, Mr. Singh. Are you alright? What happened? Yeah, I'm fine. Come on. Pick up the phone, Nandi. Fuck! Greetings! Hello! Have we met before? On the 30th of March, 1988. Excellent! You even remember the date. It's kinda difficult to forget. Pardon me, but I'm a bit busy. Actually, a cousin of mine… had fallen in love with someone from your family. Since my father was the eldest in the family, he came over with a proposal. I had bunked school and tagged along. But you bluntly refused. You said that a carpenter's son could never marry into a Siddiqui family. Does that ring a bell? Goodbye. This case of #lovejihad has come to light in Sawalpur today. I really need to go. If you could get me dropped to my car, I can at least collect my laptop. -Yes, of course. -Yes. And… all the best. Thanks. Sir. Sorry, that's all the help I can offer you. But if you ever need anything, you know how to find me. Immi! Yes, brother? -Drop him off at the Bartoli Junction. -Yes, brother. Bhanwar, Tomar is here. WESTERN PROVINCE POLICE -Tomar. -What is all this? This is the car he eloped in with sister-in-law. They couldn't have gone too far. There are checkpoints all over the city. Leave the car, and look for sister-in-law. Sir, just let me get my hands on that scum. He'll run so fast, with his tail between his legs, that no one will be able to catch him. Monty, I will shoot you, I swear! Hey, moron! Put that away! I'm so fucking done with having to clean up your mess! Law and order in the state be damned! Let's see what to do. It's a nice car. She's a beauty. How much do you think it costs? Must cost a fortune, I'm sure. This one comes with multiple drive modes. Drive mode. That means at the turn of a knob, you can climb it up a mountain. Turn it again, and burn through the sand. Turn it again, and glide through the snow. What the hell? No wonder it costs a fortune! -Ishaan. -Yes? -Remember Mumtaz from the old fort? -Hello? He'll get us a good deal for it. Dada… Parvez also gives a good price. I'm not going to any Parvez or Mumtaz. But Mumtaz is like my brother. You are trying to nab Rahab, and want to strike a deal with Parvez? Do you have any values or not? Hang up and inform Jai immediately. -Let's go! We've found sister-in-law! -She has been found. -They cannot get away. -Yes, brother. He's right here with me. We'll lose the car if we leave. We'll make more money by selling this car than being Vicky's lackeys! Assholes! Wait, I'm coming too! They are calling you a Love Jihadi. Your picture with Nivi is going viral all over Sawalpur. BEWARE INDIA What nonsense is this? I'm gonna report this. You can do that once you're in Delhi. -Hop on. We need to get out of here. -Fuck! Ali Uncle has told Vicky everything. That's where these scums are headed. After the two of you. Santosh! Santosh! Sandeep! -Not inside. -I'm coming. You promised me… Why are you calling incessantly? Tell the DGP that Tomar sir is busy handling the riots. I will talk to him tomorrow. You still have the pills, right? I'm not taking any pills. Give them to your wife. Does it look like I'm joking? Make sure you take the pill. Don't just stand there. Come on… Control room to Ghanta Ghar. Note down the number plate of any vehicle passing by. Control to headquarters. They haven't reached the university. Jai Hind, sir. Yes, Dharmesh. I've been trying to call you, sir. There's been a murder. Where? Vicky Bana's farmhouse. Vicky Bana's farmhouse? Yes. Did you check his ID? Yes, sir. It's some Santosh Kumar. What did you say his name was? Santosh? Yes, sir. His sister found his body. Come on. You need to go to the police station. You'll clear the table or should I do it? Moron! Can't you see there's someone sitting here? -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. Where is your car? It broke down. Shall I send my driver? Okay, sir. What can I get you? Balram! Out of my way! Yes, sir? Is anyone headed for Doli? Towards Doli? Yes, sir. That man over there. But his name is Sharif. Will you go with him? Okay, sir. Sharif, drop him off at Doli. It's on your way. Why did he close the door? It's a ladies' matter. So, what brings you here? Murder. Someone killed my brother. What did your brother do? He worked at a farmhouse. I went there to give him dinner. Where is this farmhouse? Near the bypass. It belongs to Vicky Bana. These days, Chandan was also staying there. Listen. What were you doing at the farmhouse? Why will I go to the farmhouse? Look, I know you weren't at home, because I was outside your house. And if you were not at the farmhouse, then why does the location show you were there? Are you bloody tracking me? Her brother's name was Santosh. I'm sure, you didn't go there to kill the poor sod. So, what exactly were you doing there? Okay, Just tell me, how much did Gyaan Singh pay you? Or was it Vicky Bana? You think I'm doing this just for myself? Don't ask so many questions. You handle her, while I take care of the body at the farmhouse. Just tell me who you wanted to kill, and I will handle her. I went there to kill Chandan. Happy? Now, do as I said. Our futures are at stake here. Please take my statement. Bitch! You're here to file a complaint after killing your own brother! Do you think the police are dumb? No, madam. That's not true. -What are you saying? -Ever heard of police brutality? When they take you in and thrash you, you'll admit to anything, let alone killing your own brother! The police force neither has the time nor the manpower to investigate every second murder. Be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and they make you a scapegoat. Where's your husband? He works at a hotel in Mumbai. Great. Then he must be making a decent buck. Go to him. Take my phone number. Call me if you need anything. Yes. Listen. Section 144 has been imposed in the entire city. Do not congregate in public spaces. Everyone, go back to your homes! And don't wander towards the old town. It can be dangerous. Now, disperse! What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this?! Tell me! Please take Nivi along and leave. I must go back home. There's no telling what Vicky's men will do. Hang on. Where do you want me to take her? I need to get to the Nahargarh Fort for my wife's book launch. And how can you go back? It's your responsibility, both of you, to drop me till Nahargarh. Come on. Take me to Nahargarh! You drive! Rahab. You can go anywhere you wish to. But please take Nivi with you. Vicky's cronies are looking for you everywhere. And only Nivi can save you from them. Immi. -Immi, give me the keys. Hurry! -Yes, brother. Look, you don't have to take my responsibility. I will find Nahargarh. I will get there by myself. Sir, you don't know these people. They are all animals. For you to stay alive, I must be by your side. By the way, can you ride a bike? I didn't expect this from you. Won't you support us in this ordeal? I asked Immi. Saif dropped them off somewhere on the new town road. If you don't believe me, I'll send him out. You can chop his head off. Vicky Bana, Santosh… the guy who used to mow the lawns at the farmhouse. He has been found dead. Somebody shot him in the head. Let me handle that. You guys focus here. We must find sister-in-law by daybreak, okay? -Okay. -Leave. Come on, leave! Everyone, out! You knew, didn't you? It's our friend Chandan, man. It's either Chandan or our political career. You decide. Your political career. Yes, my flipping political career! And what do you want to do? Do you want to keep running errands for your political bosses all your life? Where is Chandan? This is your last chance, my friend. Take it. I told him to go hide in Doli. -Hello? -Bana. Where are you? Bana… these guys want to kill me! What guys? That I don't know. They shot Santosh with a silencer on the gun. Seems like they're powerful people. They've even hired a shooter from out of town. What nonsense! It's not nonsense. I'm alive by the grace of God. Otherwise, that bullet was meant for me. You should be alert. Maybe they are coming after you as well. Okay. I'll be alert. How much time before you reach Doli? About an hour. Bana, I am thinking of going straight to the media. Once I'm seen on TV, these terrorists won't be able to touch me. Don't talk like an idiot! What are you going to tell the media? That you're lying low? I'll talk to the Director General and handle this. Please tell me that you didn't carjack the vehicle you're traveling in. I'm not a moron, Bana. I'm in a truck. Hitched a ride. Call me when you get there. -Goodbye, Bana. -Yeah. Stay alert-- Who is after your life? Did I ask you what's in the truck? No. Then mind your own business! But I'm not smuggling them. Then it's even riskier! What's the risk in driving a truck? Hey, are you high? Or have you completely lost it? You are carrying dozens of cattle! Don't you know what is happening in these parts lately? Aren't you scared for your life? Look, man… I've already sold one of my kidneys. If I live in constant fear, I might have to sell the other one as well. You shouldn't be scared either. What am I scared of? Whatever you're running from. Hey, kidney seller! Don't try to get smart with me. Well, if the price is right, I'll sell off the other one as well. You dumbfuck! How the hell will you survive without your kidneys? The first one would've grown back till then! -What? -Yeah. Who told you that, you buffoon?! The doctor. We are reaching there. The rioters have wreaked havoc and shut down routes. Didn't you say he died peacefully? It's not my fault, Bana. You said Chandan was alone at the farmhouse. Inaccurate information in these matters can-- Fix your mistake. He's on a truck headed for Doli. Clean up this mess. I'm sick and tired of it. Hello? Is the girl with you? Yes. I took care of it. She won't say anything. How can you be so sure? Get rid of her. We can't take a chance. There has been a murder at Vicky Bana's farmhouse. Before someone orders a probe, get rid of the girl. -Understood? -Okay. The spring seems Slightly crazy today There's opium growing In the fields of mustard With the evening Fireflies in tow Stroked the wings of the butterfly Catch him! That's him! Catch that rascal! Stroked the wings of the butterfly The spring seems Slightly crazy today -What are you doing here? -Don't you recognize me? Section 144 has been imposed in the entire city. Do not congregate in public spaces. -Alright, leave. -Everyone, go back to your homes. Shit! -Fuck. -What do we do now? What do we do? Let's go. Fuck it! Come on. The spring seems Slightly crazy today What are you doing? What did I do now? Ma'am… Shut your trap. Tomar held you back really late today. I don't want dinner, Mom. -I have to go back to work. -It's for him. He has a wife to feed him. Don't you get it? He takes care of you. Tomorrow if he's not there, everyone else will pounce on you! Anything else, Mom? Don't you see where I ended up staying true to the ties of holy matrimony with this man? Stay on Tomar's good side. The money will keep coming. And ask him to find some poor sod who you can marry. A husband for show, and Tomar to run the household. Understood? Just do as Tomar says. Okay? That thing you're looking for… is in the trunk behind the curtains. Why do you touch my stuff, Mom? That's the second time in a month. I'm just doing as he says, Mom. They had to flee from Butcher's Lane. We gave them refuge here. Please hurry up, they are in a pitiful state. Welcome to the news bulletin of the hour. This case of #lovejihad was brought to notice in Sawalpur today. Take a close look at this man. Despite being a Muslim, he eloped with a Hindu girl… Section 144 has been imposed… Several areas of the city have been severely affected. Several shops, cars, and neighborhoods… Couldn't have found a better time to elope, right? You could've waited for this thing to blow over. The urge must've been too hard to control. Yes, we lost control. The lust was too much! It wasn't him, but me who couldn't hold it down anymore. I entrapped him. Now, what will you call this? Reverse Love Jihad? Or war on love? Where are you going? No, wait. Don't just walk away after giving your opinion. Hear mine as well. -You're a college student, right? -Yes. -But you're so dumb that-- -Nivi, calm down. Sir, one second. You believe anything that appears on social media. -But the video-- -What? -What video? -Everyone says it's the truth. Do you even know us? But you arrived at your own conclusion. One needs to use their head to identify right from wrong. You just stick to playing your video games. Chill out, hang out on social media. Why use your head, right? No need to ask any questions. I have willingly run away from home. He has no connection to it whatsoever. Today is the first time I've met him. I didn't even know his name until about an hour ago. -I'm sorry. -One idiot tells another idiot something -and that's how rumors are spread. -Nivi. Have you seen Gyaan Singh's daughter? Emergency services are being rushed to the people. Several neighborhoods of the old city have been deserted. Come this way. People are leaving the city without caring for their valuables or lives. -Come, carefully. -According to our correspondent… I think the highway is that way. On the other side of the cenotaphs. Let's go. Careful. Watch out for the snake pit. Where had you two disappeared? Stand down! I'm Gyaan Singh's daughter! Stand down! We haven't done anything. It's not our fault, ma'am. What do you mean? Please tell Vicky Bana that these things happen during elections. I tried to talk him out of it. Asked him to shut the meat shop down. But he didn't listen. Being a butcher was the only thing he knew. Please let us stay here tonight. We'll leave at the crack of dawn. My parents' home is nearby. If you leave now, you can never come back. I understand your situation, but… We cannot trust these people. If Vicky Bana finds out, he will send Chandan to kill all of us. Let's go. DOLI It's not your fault. It kind of is, sir. You are a good man. Being a good man isn't a virtue anymore. What do you mean? I mean… Now look, my own city wants me dead. I left everything behind and came here. To die? I can't even remember the last time I prayed. You know… if I die now… my death will be a complete waste. Muslims will say that there was a person named Khan. He got killed. Hindus will say even Dubey was killed. In this chaos and whataboutery, everyone will soon forget me. It won't make any difference to anyone. The only people it will make a difference to are my father and my wife. It will make a difference to me, sir. Why? Why will it make a difference to you? Because I'm a good person? No, Nivi. You will just feel guilty. Because I'm not a good person, you are. I came all the way to India to be a good person. You are a very rare person. In fact, too nice. The men that I've dealt with… I really am not. What do you mean? I mean… I'm a liar. I'm a fucking liar! Trust me. I tell people a story during my lectures and interviews. "The reason I left America." And why did you leave America? I tell people how I saved the lives of an Indian grandfather and his grandson from some racist people. I had the fucking balls to do what I did. But the story is a white lie! Actually… I got off the train and fled. I was scared. You know… I told this lie to myself so many times that I started believing it was true. Come on! Enough now. Please come back home. Hey! -Let's go. -Come on. -Come on… -Sister-in-law, please. -I will shoot! I swear I will! -Shoot me! I'm telling you… Sorry, sister-in-law. I warned you… What have you done?! Sorry, sister-in-law! Where are you going, you bloody moron?! Call the ambulance! What… Stop the car! Stop! Stop! Please stop! Hey, stop the vehicle! Stop! Here comes the pain! What's in there? Let us go, sir. Buy something for the kids. What is this? Trying to bribe me? -Trying to bribe me?! -No, sir. Just answer the question! What is in there? Please let me go. What will you gain from arresting a poor man? I won't get paid if I don't complete the delivery. My kids will starve to death. Who is he? Just the cleaner. Hey, you! Look at me. Hey! Look here! Hey, cleaner! Look here! What the-- Step on it! Step on it now! Chandan, I fucked up. I'm totally screwed. What happened? I tried convincing Nivi ma'am… but she wasn't listening. My gun misfired and she got shot. What? Where is Nivi ma'am? I guess they are taking her to Agarwal Hospital at the old bypass. Please save me, bro. Vicky Bana will kill me. -You're like an older brother to me. -You'll be fine. I'm here for you. Tell me… why is that bastard Tomar after my life? You know they treat me like a child. But I think Vicky Bana met Tomar in the morning. I better leave. Someone might see me. Sharif. Give me my bag. I'm going back. Sharif! Tomar, you bastard! Tracking my location again? That was Chandan in the truck, right? Before he disappears again, follow that truck. Did you take care of the girl? Why? What if I didn't? Will you tell everyone at the police station… that they have your permission to sleep with me? Let's deal with this first. The patient has been shot. -Shot? -Yes, she is bleeding. Sir, please bring the stretcher. -Yeah. -Hurry up. Careful. She has been shot. You'll have to file an FIR first. -FIR? -Yes. She needs a doctor. Can't you see she's lost so much blood? Will you take responsibility if she dies? -Will you? -Listen, I-- -Will you take responsibility?! -I don't know all that. Protocols need to be followed. -What is the patient's name? -Nivi. Hurry up! I need the patient's full name, not her nickname. Full name? Are you giving her a migration certificate? Nivi Singh! What is your relationship with the patient? You're such a strange woman! The patient is dying, and you want to write her entire biodata! -Call the doctor. -I am. -Call the doctor! -Yes, I am. DR. DIPANKAR PANDEY Doctor! Pandey! Hey! You cannot go in like this! -Sir, please-- -What are you doing? Rahab, what are you doing here? Thank God it's you, Dipu! Please come. -What happened? -Please come fast. -Tell me what happened? -Come on. -Doctor? -Listen… What are you… -Listen, sir. -Where have you been? She's been shot. She is Gyaan Singh's daughter. If anything happens to her, this hospital and your protocols will get royally screwed. Alright, Rahab. Relax. I'll take a look. -Bihari. -Yes, sir? Ready the OT immediately. Sir, the OT is already occupied, and four more patients are in the queue. Oh, God! Do one thing. Take her inside. -Yes, sir. -Come on. Come on. Please give me your phone. I need to make a call. All the cell towers are jammed due to the curfew. Do one thing. Try the landline. This way. This one's dead. I don't know how you are related to him. But when I was passing by… I found his body on the side of the road. I'm informing you because your number was the last number he dialed. I buried him so that some wild animal doesn't eat him. Four kilometers before Doli. Near Chamori Check Post. Hold on. I see something on the left. Stop. Go back. Look at that. Yes. That's Sharif from Bindodi village. His family is on the way. Beware of hitchhikers, you idiot! Wasn't Chandan very close to Vicky Bana? Yes, he was. But then… Then? Well, the alliance happened. It's politics. I'll explain some other time. I understand everything. -Is it done? -Luck! What? That buffoon's luck is shining bright, Bana. He recognized me. If you keep making mistakes, he's bound to recognize you. I haven't even gotten to the bad news yet. I know he's a dimwit, but the location has been compromised twice. He must have figured out that you are involved. I'm sending the vehicle's registration number. The asshole is in a truck full of cattle. Tell your boys to keep an eye. My boys are busy somewhere else. Bana, tell them to leave everything and find Chandan. I'm sending an alert to all the police stations. If we lose him again… both of us will be in serious trouble. Note down this truck's registration number. Make it viral. There is beef in the truck. What? They are smuggling beef. Should I drop Nivi's case? Just do as I say, wiseass! Can you do it? On it, sir. On it. CATTLE ARE BEING SMUGGLED IN TRUCK NUMBER WP 03 MT 3587 What is it? Why were you calling? Take a close look at this man. Despite being a Muslim, he eloped with a Hindu girl against her will. Lucky escape. The bullet went right through. I did all I could. You will have to take her to a better hospital tomorrow. How are you feeling now? I really hope the worst is behind us now. Where is that buffoon Ishaan? That scum ran away. Dipu? -Shall we leave now? -Two minutes. Let me prescribe some medicines. Yes, they are still here. Rahab, I'll tell my driver to drop you off. Ms. Vyas, call the driver. They need a lift to Nahargarh. And… why is the gate closed? Who locked it? Ms. Vyas, I'm asking you something. Sir, these are Vicky Bana's orders. We need to detain them here. Who gave you the right? Am I in charge here or are you? Bihari! Where is the key? Where is Bihari? Bihari! Sir, Bihari is at the main gate. Vicky Bana's men will be here soon. Stop. Let Vicky Bana arrive. Come what may… I won't let anything happen to you. What are you guys doing here? -Tell me. -Vicky Bana's orders. We need to detain them here. The spring seems Slightly crazy today Nivi ma'am… The spring seems slightly crazy today -Open the gate. -Vicky Bana's orders.

Please take me to him. I will take you to him. First, take us to Nahargarh Fort. Is the doctor in? Bana, we are fucked! Is Nivi alright? I can't tell you over the phone, Bana. Come to Agarwal Hospital immediately. I'll be there soon. You handle everything. I'm leaving. -Tell us! -Speak up, or I'll bash your face! -They were headed for Nahargarh. -Where? -Where? -Nahargarh. Chandan is heading for Nahargarh in the truck with sister-in-law. The video is trending at number 1, sir. Just pull that video down right now. Are you serious? That's not how it works. Now even God cannot take this video down. Gyaan Singh's daughter is on that truck! They will kill her! Bastard, I will fucking kill you! Hey, Bobby… Son of a… Come on, hurry up! Fuck! How far is Nahargarh? Two hours. -That's the same truck, right? -Yes. Take a picture and post it on our group. -Share the location as well. -Okay. Let them know that the truck is moving towards Nahargarh. Okay. Yes, Bana. Any update? It turns out that Nivi is in the same truck with Chandan. They are headed to Nahargarh Fort. Stop them before it's too late. I'm on my way. Okay. Consider it done. Please give me your phone. Chandan, he's asking for your phone. Give it. Come on. -Are you on Qwitter? -Yes.

Stop the truck. Please tell him, sister-in-law. Look into the camera and say whatever you're feeling right now. Just be honest and real. Start. Hello, my name is Nivedita Singh. My father Gyaan Singh is a politician from Sawalpur, and he's fondly called Hukum. A video of mine was circulated today, which claims I'm a victim of Love Jihad. But that's a lie. It was my personal decision to leave home. Because I didn't want to marry Vikram Singh. The person you see in this video is a complete stranger who helped me. And his only fault is that he belongs to a different religion than me. Vikram took complete advantage of this situation and spread this vile rumor about me. I'm making this video because I want to request all of you to stop turning my personal life into a political agenda. Please. While stepping out of my house today, I never imagined I would see so much hatred around me. If anything happens to me or my friend Rahab… then my fiancé Vikram Singh will be responsible for it. And you too, Papa. I'm sorry, I… I made this so personal. That was amazing. -Is it done? -The network here is weak. Fuck off. Nice performance. Take the call. It could be Rahab trying to call you from a different number. Just take the call. -Hello? -Hello, Nandita? Rahab! Where the fuck are you? Where are you, Rahab? It's midnight! Just check Qwitter. #sawalpur What? Qwitter? What did you do this time? BEWARE INDIA ATTENTION! Oh, my God! Rahab. Just… get here right now. Hello? -Hello, Nandita? -Hello. Hello, Nandita? Nandita-- Shit! What was the need? Why did Nivi madam have to run away like this? Hello, mister! Couldn't you figure that out from the video we just recorded? They are engaged. The wedding is in two weeks. -The man was bound to lose his mind. -What do you mean? Is he allowed to shoot her if he loses his mind? This is Ishaan's fault. He shouldn't have shot at sister-in-law. Only Vicky Bana has that right. Welcome to my world! Fuck! That seems to be our truck. Shit! PROTECTORS OF SAWALPUR WP 03 MT 3587 Is this Vicky's birthright too? Someone is provoking him. Update from the local police station. The Love Jihad couple is on this truck. Yes, sir. Security has the same information. If anyone asks, just say that it's a law and order situation. -Otherwise, it will create a panic. -Close it. Close it. Hurry up. Close the gate. Come on. -Hurry up. -Come on. Hurry up. -The situation is not good. -Close it quickly! Hello! Open the door! Take your truck someplace else. Get out of here. There's an event going on. I'm here to attend that event. My wife is in there. They've closed the gates. Oh, man… Open the gate. If I stay out here, I will get killed. Shut up! We know you're the guy from the video. -Love Jihadi. Get lost! -What Love Jihadi?! There is no such thing! -Open the gate, please! -Close it. What the-- Fuck! -What are they saying? -Even these guys are saying the same shit! Love Jihadi and whatnot! Call your wife. You said she is inside. She will help us. Why aren't you calling her? Rahab. -Where are you? -Don't be fooled by the light at the end of the tunnel. It's just another incoming train. They are not letting us in. I'm standing outside the gate. These guys aren't opening it. They're saying all sorts of things. Love Jihad and whatnot! Open the gates! Open the gates! Yeah? Tell them Gyaan Singh's daughter is with you, and she wants to talk. -Wait, she's talking to them. -Tell them who I am. I give you Gilles Chuyen. Sir, please. -Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. -My husband is outside. He's saying the guards aren't letting him in. It's a really big misunderstanding. You have to let him in. Ma'am, I know there's a situation. We're trying to get a handle on it. -You'll have to give me some time. -I don't have time. Listen, he's my husband. He's supposed to be here. He's on the list. Just check your list. I know, ma'am. But things have spiraled out of control. I don't think you know what your husband has been up to. I don't know my husband?! Are you serious? Listen, it's obviously fake news. I know him. Do you really? There is a law and order situation in the state because of him. We can't take any security risks here. Some very dangerous people are after me. If I stay here, they might kill me. Please, open the gates! His life is in danger, and your people are not opening the gates. Sorry, Nandita. It has gone out of my hands. -Let me see what I can do. -Open the gates! -Any possibility? -Not possible, sir. The authorities are saying that we can't risk the lives of everyone else -for her husband's sake. -What is this? -Have you all gone mad? -Please explain it to them. -Of course, he's innocent. -Hello! Open the gates, please. How can you be so sure? -Open the gates, for God's sake! -What are you trying to say? I mean to say that the girl is only 23. He should have thought things through. -Why aren't you listening? Are you deaf? -Stop it, Avinash. Hello! Fuck! Hello! Does anyone in here have the courage to save a life? My husband is fighting for the life of a strange girl along with his own! And all you have to do… I thought you guys are big shots. But you guys too are nobodies just like me. Does anyone have it in you? Get it opened, sister-in-law. -Can anyone of you help him? -Those fuckers will be here any minute. Chandan, ram the truck inside. To help them, we just need to open the fort gates. Sister-in-law, are you sure? Go on. Anyone? -Can anyone help me? -Ram the truck in, Chandan. Seriously? Chandan, look after Nivi. Are you guys just going to stand there and watch? Ram the truck in. Just do it! -Sister-in-law, it's Bana. -Ram the truck in! Chandan! Open the gates! We are all respected, educated, -rational people here! -Open the gates! Open the gates! Please! My name is Rahab. Check your bloody delegate list! My name's on it! Nivi, come down. Come on. -Don't you want to meet Hukum? -Get down. -Handle your Bana. -Nivi! I said stop! -Come down. -Come on! Open the gates! Bana. So, your balls have grown so big that you're pointing a gun at me? -But you were trying to kill me. -You dumbfuck! Please open the gates. If I wanted to kill you, would you be still standing here? Wouldn't you be dead by now? -Then why did you send Tomar after me? -Why did Tomar come after you?! You must have fucked with him! I'm tired of saving you all the time. Why are you doing this? Open the gates! But, Bana… Go, finish off that asshole! He eloped with your sister-in-law. Go and kill him. Bana… Didn't you tell me that you'd go to any lengths for me? Was it just big talk? Go and kill that bastard! Nandita! Open the gates! Nandita! Open the gates! Fuck. Open the gates! For God's sake! -Can anyone come forward to help?! -Open the gates! Are you all just going to… -Nivi, get down. -Open the gates. -I said get down. -Open the gates, or they will kill us! -Get lost! -Nivi… -Get lost! -Nivi… Stop behaving like a fucking… Get down! Bhanwar, you fucker! Stay there! -Open the gates! -Can anyone come forward and help? Pick up the gun. If you leave us out here, we won't survive! -Open the gates! -No! -No! -Nivi… stop it. -Hey-- -Vicky! Vicky, let's get out of here. Let me drive. -Dickhead! How will you control her?! -Let me drive! Meet me on the bridge. -Open the gates! -Leave! -Nivi-- -Leave! Let go! -Enough! -He is banging on the door! Open the door! Please! Stay still! You can do whatever the fuck you want later. But you'll stay quiet until the elections. Hello! I know you guys are still here. Open the gates! Do something! Hello, my name is Nivedita Singh. My father Gyaan Singh is a politician… What have you done? Sorry, nerd. Bana's orders. Hey… move aside. -Come out! -Get out! We won't spare you today! Out of the way. It's the same truck. Yes, it's the same. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! What are you doing? What… Nivi? Nivi, stop this. Have you lost your mind, Nivi? They will think I'm Rahab! They will think I'm Rahab.

Beat him! Beat him! -Don't spare him! -Hey! That jerk Chandan must have told the entire story to Nivi. Let's just get rid of her. No one will know who shot her amidst the crowd. -Stand down, Tomar. -Let go of me. The girl from the farmhouse is alive. What did you say? Use your head, not your gun. Just do as I say. Follow me. How dare you elope with her?! From now on, you will stay away from me. Everything is over between us. And if you don't listen to me… then the girl will go straight to the DGP. Mr. Tomar. Brilliant! That's not a part of my act. Rahab! What happened? Save my life, Nandi. I don't want to die. -You're not gonna die. Call a doctor! -I don't want to die. If I die… my death will be a total waste. It won't make a difference to anyone. Save my life. I don't want to die. -This is too early. -You're not gonna die. Save my life. What's in the truck? Open the shutter. -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! All of you must be thinking, "How will this girl understand our situation?" How will a girl, who left the state for a big city at a young age, understand the problems of villagers? The time of the veil is up! It's now time for women to cross the threshold of their homes. -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam. -Glory be to… -Rashtriya Vikas Dal. -Glory be to… -Rashtriya Vikas Dal. -Glory be to… -Rashtriya Vikas Dal. -Glory be to… -Rashtriya Vikas Dal. -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! -Glory be to… -Nivi madam! It needs to be razed for a new beginning. Come on. Give me a hand.
