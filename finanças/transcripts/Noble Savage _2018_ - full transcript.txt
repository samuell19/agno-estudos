Eli? ﻿Eli? ﻿Eli? ﻿Eli, come here. ﻿Eli, ﻿Say, which looks more conservative, this or this? ﻿The other dress. ﻿This one? ﻿Is it for a wedding? ﻿No, I have Step 9. ﻿What's that? ﻿Never mind that now. Go to the club, get me 200 shekels. ﻿Hey, give me a kiss. ﻿Mommy loves you. ﻿I love you. ﻿Go get it. Quickly. ﻿Is that yours? ﻿What's your name? ﻿Anna. ﻿Eli. ﻿Eli, stop! Where are you going, Fatso? Wait up. ﻿Give us a bite, you fat ass. ﻿Give me a bite, Asshole. ﻿Were you at the club? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Hand it over. ﻿Come here, hand it over. - I'm giving it to Sima! ﻿Asshole... ﻿Why aren't you using a glass? ﻿Sima, what's Step 9? ﻿Aren't you forgetting something? ﻿Where's the rest? ﻿School bill. ﻿Eli, we're trying to run a normal household here. ﻿I hope you're not lying, because I remember paying that. ﻿School bill, I'm telling you. If you want you can check. ﻿I will. ﻿I can call Shimha. She knows who paid what and when. ﻿She knows everything, so don't make me do that. ﻿Fine, can you tell me what the fuck Step 9 is? ﻿Stop it. ﻿Stop it. ﻿He doesn't respect me. He's ruining the normality in this house. ﻿What do you want to do about it? ﻿Put him under room confinement until the morning. Six hours. ﻿What did he do? ﻿He mouthed off. ﻿Did you mouth off? ﻿Three hours. It isn't room confinement, it's an educational punishment. ﻿Fine, make it five hours. ﻿Four hours, and remember that Yefet is like a father to you ﻿and you have no right to mouth off at him so behave in a way ﻿that's normal between father and son, alright? ﻿Yeah. - Great. ﻿Can I shower before I serve my time? ﻿Do as she says. Off to your room. What's Step 9? ﻿I'll tell you later. ﻿What? What? ﻿Yefet? ﻿I stole about a meter or so. ﻿I wanna see the city inspector that will dare open his mouth. ﻿You're so talented. You made the prettiest yard in the neighborhood. ﻿Talent... -I'm crazy about you. "-Talent, right. -Crazy! ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿My love. I'm going to do Step 9 with Yom Tov. ﻿Go somewhere for an hour or two. ﻿Why? ﻿I invited him over. ﻿Here? Why? ﻿Why here? Why in my house? ﻿I need my quiet, I need to feel protected. ﻿Why with him? ﻿Come here. ﻿Nice dress, Sima. ﻿Right? ﻿What is it? ﻿What, Eli? ﻿Nice, but... ﻿Maybe put on something more... ﻿More what? - Less. ﻿Less what? You're driving me crazy. ﻿Less long, shorter. ﻿Excite him. ﻿Do I have to spell out everything to you? ﻿When's he coming? ﻿Right now. ﻿What's going on? Aren't you going to her? ﻿As soon as I finish my beer. ﻿Finished, come on. ﻿Put on a shirt. ﻿Where's the deodorant? ﻿Deodorant? Let's not give her any ideas? ﻿Nonsense. ﻿You know her, she's sensitive to smell, give her respect. ﻿Go to her. ﻿I thought you threw it away. ﻿Why? It's part of my past. You don't throw away your past. ﻿You deal with it. ﻿Maybe someday it will be worth a lot of money, your abstract. ﻿You used to call it garbage. ﻿What changed? ﻿That's part of my learning process. ﻿I'm learning to contain. It's difficult, but important. ﻿You should try it. ﻿So, ﻿are you still painting like that? ﻿No. I'm in a holocaust period. ﻿Holocaust? ﻿You're back to that? ﻿Never mind now, why did you call me? ﻿I want to apologize for all the bad stuff I did to you while I was using. ﻿I want to ask for your forgiveness. ﻿You know, besides forgiveness... ﻿We made a strict divorcement settlement while you were using... ﻿I can barely pay Eli's maintenance. ﻿I don't believe it. I'm asking for your forgiveness, ﻿you know how hard it is for me, spilling my guts, ﻿and that's all you have to say? - I thought that's why you called me. ﻿You've got the club. You can make tons of money. ﻿That's dirty money, Sima. My brother can do whatever he wants, ﻿it isn't for me. ﻿Really? Why, because you're a painter? ﻿I get to suffer because you're crazy in the head? ﻿Are you picking a fight now? ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿What do you want to do? ﻿Take less, I'm barely making a living. ﻿What if I want a family? Financially, I can't. ﻿I can't go on a date with someone. ﻿In theory, Sima. I... ﻿If, if, I'm not planning on starting a family. I have no such intentions. ﻿Or to date. ﻿You can do whatever you want. It's your life. ﻿Step 9 is making you better. ﻿You're calmer. ﻿More rational. ﻿To be honest... ﻿even prettier. ﻿Thanks. ﻿I think I'll be going. ﻿No, no. ﻿No. ﻿No... ﻿This isn't right, Sima. ﻿We're like siblings now. ﻿Right. ﻿Like siblings. ﻿Anna! ﻿You're fucked. ﻿This is the worst school in Tel Aviv. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Hey, Lardo. - What's up, Fatso? ﻿Look at all those snacks. ﻿What's up? ﻿Russia, want a snack? ﻿Want some of this? - What's up, fatso? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Son of a bitch... ﻿Get off me. ﻿What do you think you're doing? - Fuck this Fatso up! ﻿Relax. - Get him! ﻿Fuck off! ﻿Fuck the hell off! ﻿I'll fuck you up, you son of a bitch. ﻿Fuck off. ﻿Shut up, you Russian cunt! Go to your massage parlor. ﻿Shut up, you bastard. ﻿What happened to you? ﻿I fell. ﻿How did it go? ﻿Good. It was good. Step 9 is good for her. ﻿What are you going to do? ﻿Answer me. ﻿Eli, she has a boyfriend. ﻿So what? She still wants you. - Did you peek? ﻿It doesn't matter. She wants you and you want her. ﻿It's more complicated than that. Sima and I never laughed at the same jokes. ﻿We like different movies. That's no reason to get a divorce. ﻿Never mind that. ﻿Is she sexy ﻿You want her. ﻿Don't lie to me, you want her. So cut the crap. ﻿I'm going to the club, are you coming? ﻿No. ﻿She'll probably be there, I can't, Eli. ﻿I can't. ﻿You've got the sexiest lady in the world and you're here painting. ﻿I'm working! ﻿Fine, at least try selling them. ﻿I'm not doing it for the money. I'm not trying to sell. ﻿You aren't selling them because no one wants to buy them. -Nonsense! ﻿What kind of painter doesn't sell his paintings? ﻿The art market is controlled by different interests. ﻿You're going to the club? Get me my beer. ﻿If you're not coming, I'll tear this one. - Eli, not that one, leave it. ﻿I swear I'm gonna tear it. ﻿I'm gonna tear it. Are you coming? ﻿Enough. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Get dressed. ﻿Your mother's a queen. ﻿I mean it. ﻿What happened to your face? ﻿Nothing. ﻿And what's his name? - He just fell, Nachshon. ﻿Fell, right. ﻿Got it. ﻿There you go. ﻿Enjoy. - Thanks. ﻿And for luck. Our late grandfather's eldest great-grandchild. ﻿Bless you. ﻿Amen! ﻿Eli, give him back the money. ﻿Give him back the beer. Same thing. ﻿It's not the same. That's beer, that's money. ﻿Give it back. ﻿It's your money, kid. ﻿Let's talk in the kitchen. ﻿We have no secrets. We're family. ﻿Come on. - What do you want? ﻿Listen to me. - What's wrong, Yom Tov? ﻿There are other ways to show love to a child. A hug, ice cream... ﻿I don't get you. Here, take it. ﻿I don't understand you. ﻿I don't want him to take the money. I don't... ﻿That's also money from from this place. You don't like it? Don't come next month. ﻿Here, enjoy. - Thank you. ﻿Cheers. ﻿His name's Eran, Eran Mizrachi. His father's Shlomo, from the buses. ﻿He did this to me. ﻿Alright. ﻿I have the... maintenance here. ﻿Don't touch me. ﻿Who do you think you are? ﻿I've got a man at home a thousand times better than you. ﻿Take your hands and fuck off. ﻿Hold it. ﻿Take it. Take it. ﻿Let me help you. ﻿You've got to be decisive in life. - You're right. ﻿Stick to your beliefs. ﻿His intentions are good, but he lives on people's money and sorrow. ﻿People's sorrow. ﻿You're right. You got the last word with him. ﻿Hey! ﻿What are you looking for? Need any help? ﻿How did you find me? ﻿I saw one of your paintings at the flea market and I asked around... ﻿And here I am. ﻿What painting? - Still Life Through a Fence. ﻿That's my name for it. ﻿A fence like prison bars, ﻿and a table with fruit behind it. ﻿A forbidden fruit? - Tangerines? ﻿Yeah, I think so. ﻿That bitch. ﻿Why? ﻿That bitch is selling my paintings. ﻿Step 9 my ass. ﻿And she's calling herself spiritual. - Yefet's probably behind it, I'm telling you. ﻿She loves your paintings. ﻿We want to market your art as neo-realism. ﻿It has an immediacy, a sense of a first person experience. ﻿It's more a clean documentation of what happened there without the artist's observation ﻿I look at the painting and I don't feel a sense of process. ﻿Are you stupid? Was he there? He's an Iraqi artist from Tel Aviv, ﻿of course it's a processed holocaust experience. ﻿He's like the first Iraqi holocaust victim. - Calm down. This isn't your father's. ﻿How much for the painting? ﻿It isn't for sale, Eli. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿It's a good painting, right? So how much for the painting? ﻿A painting has to be other things, not just good. ﻿There are many variables that influence the price. -Stop shitting around. ﻿Give me an estimate for the painting. - Let it go, Eli. It's not for sale. ﻿Besides, it's Itzhakovski. I don't want to mess around with him. ﻿Mess around? He's dead. - So what? ﻿He's garbage, he's racist. I don't want to deal with him. ﻿He's in. ﻿That's what I'm talking about. It's a documentation of consciousness. ﻿Anyway, I'm not interested. ﻿Heartheir price first. Don't be an idiot. ﻿Why is he late? ﻿Sima, I don't care, ﻿but if there's one thing not normal ﻿it's not coming for Friday Kiddush. ﻿You worked, you bought challah, you cooked, ﻿dressed pretty. I've got a yarmulke, everything. ﻿Does that seem normal to you? ﻿And I gave up part of the alimony payments. ﻿You what? ﻿Are you crazy? You gave the bum a break? ﻿Who gives up money? ﻿Stop it. It's part of my rehabilitation. I need to feel strong, that I can let go. ﻿How much did you let go? ﻿700. ﻿Fuck me. ﻿I hate Step 9. Stupid Step. ﻿He's at a sensitive age. He shouldn't be with his father too much. ﻿Eli might be drinking with him now. - Stop it. Eli sees a drink he runs. ﻿Why should I stop it? ﻿You know what he's doing with his father right now? ﻿Remember Step 4, fearless self-examination. ﻿Analyzing our lives, no holding back. ﻿You're right. ﻿Of course I am. ﻿Boarding school's the best solution for him. Look at my nephews, Geula's kids. ﻿It did them good. ﻿One's a paratrooper, one's a lawyer, another one's finishing... ﻿That's the last time you mention boarding school or I'll break your bones. ﻿Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. ﻿If you were a real man, instead of babbling, ﻿you'd sock one to that bum who's ruining our home and normality. ﻿So say something. Do I have to read your mind Say the word and I finish him. Right away. ﻿Is she also a survivor from the neighborhood? ﻿Forget about it. That's not for sale either. ﻿Even though she's a whore. - A whore? -A whore. ﻿Someone from the neighborhood? - Es. ﻿She whores for money, not for art. ﻿You lousy stinking drunk. ﻿Let's go, Eli. ﻿I met you halfway, I tried to open a new leaf, ﻿and this is what you do? ﻿You know the most important thing for us is Friday Kiddush and you make him stay here. ﻿Go to the flea market, make a few more bucks. ﻿I'll just leave my business card, in case you change your mind. ﻿I want you to know that we really, really love your art. ﻿Really. ﻿Well. ﻿Thanks for the arak. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Listen, Sima. ﻿The fact he's painting you means you're important to him. ﻿No matter what you think of the painting itself. ﻿Fine. I'm a whore? An ugly whore on top of that? ﻿I'll never forgive you for that, Yom Tov. Not for the Kiddush or this shitty painting. ﻿It's not a whore. It's art. It's a documentation of reality. ﻿Documentation my ass. ﻿You always thought you were better than me, didn't you? ﻿You think I don't know that? ﻿You're better than me? Look at this place. ﻿You aren't a good role model for Eli and stick to the hours in our settlement ﻿and the alimony is back to what it was. ﻿No more new deal. ﻿Listen up. ﻿Those guys liked his paintings. They want to buy this painting. ﻿Fine, 700 fucking shekels. Enjoy. ﻿This place is worse than I remembered it. ﻿Why don't you clean up here? ﻿Quiet, Eli. ﻿How can you stand to live and sleep here in this filth? ﻿You know what grossed me out the most? - Sima... -Stop it, Eli. ﻿You stank of alcohol and didn't even wear deodorant. ﻿Let's go, Eli. ﻿And I actually believed you were better, ﻿but you're far from it. ﻿You're not giving, ﻿you're not spiritual like you boast to be. ﻿Why are you so mad? I just had dinner with my son. ﻿We never made such a fuss. ﻿Now you're talking about my sexuality? That I smell? ﻿So why? ﻿Why did you try to kiss me? ﻿Why did you want to sleep with me? ﻿I feel sorry for you. You're pathetic. ﻿I'm pathetic? - Pathetic. ﻿I pulled myself up. ﻿And you? ﻿You're the laughing stock of the neighborhood. ﻿Even your son is ashamed of you. ﻿Tell him, aren't you ashamed? ﻿You wouldn't even be accepted to the holocaust. ﻿How can could you get a woman? You stink. ﻿Come on, Eli, let's go. Before the stink kills us. ﻿Let's go, ﻿Just a second. ﻿I want that painting. ﻿Move. I don't want it staying here. - Stop it! ﻿Take your hands off me. Let's go home, come on. ﻿Eli! ﻿What happened? - Nothing. ﻿What happened? - I said nothing! ﻿What did that bum do to you? Sima. ﻿Tell me what he did. I'll kill him. - Leave me alone. ﻿It's all your fault, fatty. You and your father are both shit. ﻿Don't you know how important Kiddush is to your mother? ﻿Don't you know how much she cooked and did everything? Why? ﻿And for what? So you could sit with that drunk? ﻿I pity you, Yefet. ﻿What? ﻿You know in your heart that she still loves him. ﻿What did you say? ﻿In your heart you know it's true. He's the love of her life. ﻿You're just a substitute. ﻿As soon as he says 'yes", shell dump you. ﻿It's hard living like that, I know, I get you. ﻿Your life's a tragedy. ﻿You're with someone but she loves someone else. ﻿And whatever you do, as much as you move the fence, ﻿as hard as you try to be normal in your crooked ways, it's not going to work. ﻿Hey. ﻿Give me a hug. ﻿Do I stink? ﻿You don't, your clothes do. You have to wash them. ﻿There was no detergent in the camps. - Stop with the fucking holocaust. ﻿She's right. Who would want to live here? ﻿Sell everything and start painting something else. ﻿Sell? ﻿These painting are my salvation. ﻿If I sell them I'll go crazy. ﻿Yom Tov, take your pills. You're making me nervous. ﻿Pills... I don't need pills. ﻿You're lucky. ﻿You don't have the holocaust snuff. It's censored. ﻿The heavy stuff is shown at night. ﻿When I came home from school on Holocaust Remembrance Day ﻿they showed mountains of corpses shoved into a pit by truck. ﻿Mountains. ﻿Look, look. ﻿Bodies... ﻿Where's that asshole's business card? - What? ﻿I want to call him and get an estimate. ﻿If she knows it's worth money she'll change her tune. ﻿Where is it? - What? ﻿I need the number. ﻿I've got the number. I've got everything. -Where? ﻿You're out of your mind. ﻿You made a fucking filter out of it? ﻿Yes? ﻿Hello? Can I speak to Jonathan? ﻿Wrong number, I'm afraid. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Hello? ﻿Yes, please. ﻿Jonathan, please. ﻿Wrong number. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Jonathan, please. - There's no Jonathan here. Bye. ﻿Eli the lucky charm, I'm sorry for hitting you. ﻿Don't apologize to me. Apologize to her. ﻿Go on. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿She couldn't hear you. Don't whisper. ﻿Sorry. ﻿She's got a name. Speak up and look at her. ﻿Sorry, Anna. ﻿What happened to Eran? ﻿I guess he thought about his actions and realized he was a shit. ﻿Really? ﻿I don't think so. ﻿Maybe he simply realized he shouldn't mess with me. ﻿He's a nothing. - Of course. ﻿What's going on? Everybody get on the bus. ﻿On the bus. ﻿Wanna sit at the back? ﻿Sure. ﻿Eli. ﻿It's my mom. -I'm so sorry, it took me time to make the sandwiches. ﻿Enjoy the field trip. - Her sandwiches are the best. ﻿Mom, this is Anna. Anna, my mom. She makes the best sandwiches. ﻿Nice to meet you. I'm Anna. ﻿Don't buy snacks and candy on the way. ﻿And eat the sabich first while it's hot. ﻿Bye. ﻿Here you go. Full of good stuff. ﻿What's in it? ﻿Tasty, isn't it? ﻿It's too messy. ﻿Too messy? ﻿Too many flavors. It's crass. ﻿Crass? Where did you get that word? ﻿I learned it. ﻿If you don't like don't eat it. ﻿It's just a sandwich. - What did your mother make? ﻿Give it. ﻿Fuck. ﻿Are you crazy? - You hated the sandwich, didn't you? ﻿You don't have to throw it out. - Is this the holocaust? ﻿You didn't like it so I threw it out. ﻿You've lost it. ﻿You and your mother, worse than me. ﻿What are you making? ﻿What's wrong, Sima? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Don't say nothing. What's wrong? - Forget about it, Yefet. ﻿don't want you to interfere. ﻿Son of a bitch. ﻿Yom Tov again? What did he do? ﻿He said I'm not spiritual. I'm not spiritual? ﻿He said that? ﻿He painted me as an ugly whore. ﻿Am I ugly? - A whore? ﻿I'll kill that mother fucker. He's finished. ﻿I'll kill him. You hear me? I'll kill him. ﻿Stop it. I don't want you to get in trouble. ﻿I don't want you to violate your parole. ﻿You're the best, my love. ﻿I'll talk to him. ﻿Talk to him? ﻿He's showing people that painting. Who knows who's seeing it. ﻿Fucking shit. ﻿Is that it? It's pretty. ﻿Sima.. ﻿Mother fucker. ﻿You wanted to talk, didn't you? - Morris, come here a sec. ﻿Sit down. ﻿What is it? ﻿You know me, you know him. - I do. ﻿Let's say you're shacking up with a divorced woman. ﻿Let's say her ex talks to her behind your back. ﻿Talks about love. ﻿Are you dumb? ﻿Insults and curses her. ﻿Disrespects her. ﻿I'd pull his eyes out. Either way I'd pull his eyes out. ﻿If it's for love or for disrespecting her. ﻿Nice. ﻿Very nice. ﻿I come here like a man, I don't stir up trouble. ﻿Right. ﻿You can't talk to my fiance behind my back. ﻿You say she's ugly? She isn't spiritual? ﻿If you insult her one more time I'll knock your brains out. ﻿I'll settle things with her when I see her at the club... ﻿No more club for her. ﻿She isn't going to work there anymore. ﻿And don't go putting things in your kid's head. ﻿I don't want to see your face again. ﻿Let's have a drink. ﻿Bring the bottle. ﻿Here you go. - You're the best. ﻿You're my winning card. ﻿What are you going to do with it? Not that I care. ﻿I say burn it. ﻿I don't know yet. ﻿Anything to eat? ﻿Did you two talk? - I tried. ﻿I talked to him rationally but you can't reason with him. ﻿So I showed him. ﻿I humiliated him in front of everybody. ﻿He was probably drunk as shit. ﻿Not yet. He was sober. ﻿He wished he was drunk. I humiliated him in front of everybody. ﻿I told him not to mess with us. You or me. He'll never forget our conversation. ﻿But he's okay, right? ﻿Why do you ask? ﻿I don't want you getting in trouble with his brother Nachshon. ﻿I don't care about his brother, Sima. ﻿And I don't want you to work there anymore. I don't like you being there. ﻿I fuck him up and you work at his brother's place? ﻿How does that look? ﻿Nachshon never interferes. ﻿I don't want him to get any ideas. ﻿That job is part of my rehabilitation. And I don't want to look for work right now. ﻿Besides, Nachshon pays well. ﻿But there's alcohol there and Yom Tov there. ﻿That's it. Over. ﻿Yom Tov is there once a month. ﻿Besides, not drinking makes me stronger. ﻿I conquered the need to drink. ﻿Respect me, alright, Sima? ﻿It's Yom Tov's place too. ﻿Respect me, Sima. ﻿Hello? - Jonathan? ﻿No, Volvo dealership. - My mistake. ﻿You're nuts. ﻿You're going to thank me later. ﻿Hello? - Jonathan, please. ﻿Speaking. ﻿Jonathan from the art gallery? ﻿Yes, who is it? ﻿Auditions for a new telenovela. ﻿Here you go, girls. We're always looking for new faces. ﻿Auditions to for a new telenovela. ﻿You're perfect for it, dear. Auditions... ﻿What is it? - Auditions for a new telenovela. ﻿Give me one. -It's for girls. - Give it! ﻿Anna. ﻿Here, auditions for a telenovela. ﻿You think I'm gonna do that shit? It's beneath me. ﻿What do you care? It's perfect for you. - Leave me alone. ﻿Okay, sorry. - Go away, Eli. ﻿Where's the painting? ﻿The painting I brought yesterday. - How should I know? I didn't touch it. ﻿Sima, I'm not a kid. The painting isn't here. Where is it? ﻿I don't know. - I took it. ﻿Where is it? - None of your business. I wanted to hang it up. ﻿Bring back the painting. - I wanted to hang it up Don't you have more paintings of his? ﻿I brought the painting to burn it, not to hang it on the wall. ﻿Burn something else. ﻿Tell that to your mother who told me to bring it -Eli, bring back the painting, please. ﻿Bring it back because if I find it you're a goner. ﻿It's worth a lot of money. - My ass it's worth! ﻿Bring it back or I'll toss your room. ﻿Yefet, no need to threaten. Eli, please bring back the painting. ﻿I returned it to Yom Tov. If you want you can go to him. -You bastard. ﻿He painted you because you're important to him. - Everything he does is sincere. ﻿Yom Tov again? Yom Tov, Yom Tov... ﻿Did you ever defend me like that? Did you ever talk about me like that? ﻿I'm your mother. I made a choice and you're not respecting that. ﻿You keep taking his side. ﻿I give you everything and how do you repay me? ﻿You always take his side. Always. ﻿Son of a bitch. -Go to your room. Tell him to go to his room. ﻿Aren't you going to say anything? - You deserved that punishment. ﻿Go to your room and don't come out until tomorrow. ﻿And no going out all week. ﻿Just school and home, home and school. ﻿Are you okay? - Don't hit him ever again. ﻿Alright. ﻿Hello, you've reached the city development department. ﻿For a representative press 1. ﻿To leave a message press 2. ﻿To leave a voice mail press 9. ﻿Please leave your message. ﻿Hello, I want to report a fucker who's invading public property on 9 Elul St. ﻿A burlap fence and jagged fence posts. ﻿So just get there. ﻿Anna, go back and practice. ﻿Can I have a bite? ﻿Funny. ﻿I can't live without you. ﻿I don't know what I'd do without you. ﻿What? ﻿How was it? ﻿Sounds believable? ﻿What? ﻿I got the lines for the audition. ﻿Oh, the telenovela. ﻿Didn't you say it was beneath you? ﻿You convinced me. ﻿We need the money, so I went. They shot me, gave me lines. ﻿Cool. ﻿Anyway, you have to work on it. It was a bit forced. ﻿Never mind. It's not for me. ﻿Why? Don't. Don't give up. - I'm giving up. ﻿You just need to sound more passionate. That's it. ﻿Why don't you come over and well work on it? ﻿Sure. ﻿Great. ﻿Is that your mother? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Why didn't she come to Israel with you? ﻿Let's start. ﻿Give me a second. ﻿You're my only hope. - Yeah, yeah. ﻿You're my only hope of getting out of here. I can't live here anymore. ﻿Line? ﻿Come tonight at 7, I'll wait for you on the balcony. ﻿I love you. ﻿Then I say, I love you too. ﻿And they kiss. ﻿Come tonight at 7, I'll wait for you on the balcony. ﻿love you. ﻿I love you too. ﻿What was that sandwich thing? - What does that matter? Let's keep working. ﻿Cool down, Eli. It's too early to work on the kissing. ﻿I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. - It's just lines, I'm not into you either. ﻿Good thing we made that clear. ﻿And I'm sorry about your mother. I could've been more polite. ﻿What? ﻿About the sandwich. ﻿Forget about it. - Are you two that close? ﻿I don't feel like talking about it right now. ﻿Okay. ﻿She was a junky. ﻿Your mother? ﻿Is that a bird? ﻿A sad bird that likes drugs. ﻿That's what I thought when I was a kid. It's a drug addict. ﻿She was always like that, but after the divorce it got worse. ﻿You couldn't imagine what she did to get a fix. ﻿And she still did everything so that I wouldn't be taken away. She fought hard. ﻿When that didn't work she got herself clean for me. ﻿You're sweet. ﻿I promise not to tell anyone what you just told me. ﻿The whole neighborhood knows. ﻿You can't go to the audition like that. - Like what? ﻿The earrings, the piercings. ﻿Fuck them. -Fuck them? They're looking for someone normal. ﻿Don't tell me how to look, Eli. - They're looking for normal. ﻿Fuck normal, okay? ﻿Do you want the part or not? - Go away. ﻿What? -What don't you get Go away, Eli. Get out. Scram. ﻿What's wrong with you? Stupid. ﻿I'm sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have let him hit you. ﻿Should we watch another episode? ﻿From Eli's school, right? - Yeah, I'm in his class. Anna. ﻿This is a normal house. ﻿You can't come here in the middle of the night dressed like... ﻿Hey. - Hi, I'll go now. ﻿No, wait. I'll be back in 10 minutes. ﻿Forget it, Eli. - Isn't he grounded? ﻿Come back inside. You're grounded until the end of the week. ﻿Leave him alone.

Came by and started firing people? ﻿I dunno, he's crazy. - I never liked him. ﻿Never understood what she saw in him. - I wanted to talk to you about him. -What? ﻿Can you hit Yefet? Really fuck him up? ﻿I could make him disappear. But I won't get into it. It's between them. ﻿It's not just between them. e threatened Yom Tov and broke into his hous ﻿That's between him and Yom Tov. - He hit me and called her a slut. ﻿The Russian? ﻿Anna, yeah. ﻿You think I can't bring a few men and have his head smashed up? ﻿That ain't a problem. ﻿But I can't.

Then what? You get a job, sit in prison, ﻿while she raises her daughter overseas on your dime. ﻿That bitch. I still miss her. ﻿That cunt thinks she invented the pussy. But it's wrong. ﻿Remember when I almost left Dalya? - Yeah. ﻿But she's a good girl, she's not like that. ﻿Oh, sorry. ﻿If she's ever looking for work send her to me. ﻿That Yefet is killing me. ﻿Let's go, Anna. ﻿That was great, Anna. Not bad at all. ﻿Thanks. ﻿We're having a party on Thursday, ﻿so that the crew can get to know each other. ﻿You can come if you want. Well send you the address. ﻿Does that mean I got the part? ﻿Well find something for you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Bye. - Bye. ﻿Well? How was it? ﻿Fun. ﻿Yeah? - Yeah. ﻿I made two mistakes but I rolled with it. I think they liked it. ﻿I don't know if I got it but I have a good feeling. ﻿Great! ﻿Thank you. It's all because of the clothes you bought me. ﻿Nonsense. ﻿Let's get out of here. ﻿Good luck. - Thank you. ﻿Why "good luck" -Forget it. ﻿What's up, Yefet? ﻿Bitton, what's up? What's happening? ﻿Fine. ﻿Come in, have some coffee. - We came to check something. ﻿Come in for a coffee. Come, come. ﻿Coffee? - Sima! ﻿Bitton, how are you? -Thanks, dear. - Say hello to Rutti. -I will. ﻿When is she due? - A week or two. ﻿Boy, girl? Do you know? - Boy, thank God. -Boy? -Yeah. ﻿As long as it's healthy. - Amen. Thank you. ﻿So? ﻿We came to measure things. ﻿Measure what? ﻿They say the path is shorter. It will only take 2-3 minutes. ﻿You asshole. -Yefet... - You should be ashamed. ﻿Your mother was my kindergarten teacher. You come and take measurements? ﻿Yefet... - Don't "Yefet..." me. ﻿Get the fuck out of here. “-Yefet, calm down. ﻿We have to do our job. - Don't tell me to calm down. ﻿Get the fuck out of here. - What's wrong? ﻿That fucking bastard sent two fuckers here. - I didn't mention any names. ﻿Get out of here before I break your bones. ﻿Calm down. - Go! -Yefet! ﻿Calm him down, Sima, otherwise he'll get into trouble. ﻿Yefet, don't! - Son of a bitch... ﻿Yefet! ﻿You crazy mother fucker. - Yefet, calm down! Yefet! ﻿Son of a bitch! - Scram! ﻿Send a unit immediately. This guy's crazy. ﻿Yefet, calm down! - Yefet! Yefet! ﻿Son of a bitch. ﻿Fuck you, mother fucker. Move! - Leave, you son of a bitch! ﻿Fuck you, mother fucker! ﻿That low life should be ashamed. ﻿Who? ﻿Who? That loser Yom Tov. ﻿Willing to ruin his son's home because of his ego. ﻿Where are you going? - Cigarettes. ﻿Carton of Marlboro. - 350. ﻿And... A little bottle of vodka bottle. ﻿Sima.. ﻿Come. ﻿Did you get me the cigarettes? ﻿Call Yossi, my lawyer. He's not taking my calls. ﻿Just cigarettes, officer. - I'll be out in a couple of days. ﻿Can you make sure Yefet gets these? - Sit down. I'll help you when I'm done here. ﻿I've been sitting here for an hour. - Sit down. I'll call you. ﻿What a cunt. ﻿Sit. ﻿Don't worry, he'll get out tomorrow. We'll call Yossi the lawyer, he's great. Stinking rat. Low-life. ﻿I thought we started over. ﻿Eli, he might lose his probation. ﻿We have to be strong. ﻿Sima.. ﻿What? ﻿Nothing. We are strong. ﻿Wow, what's going on? ﻿That's just what we need now. Call a plumber. ﻿It'll take days to clean up. - We won't find a plumber at this hour. ﻿There should be a number on the fridge. ﻿Should we call Yom Tov? - Are you crazy? ﻿He'll fix it in a jiffy. - Where do you come up with these ideas? ﻿Look what's going on here. - Leave me alone! ﻿Call a plumber, wake someone up. ﻿The plumber will take at least a grand. ﻿He'll say night fee, and add on materials. ﻿At least 1,500 shekels. ﻿Yom Tov will do it for free. - Are you nuts? After what he did to us. ﻿How do you know it was him? - I'd rather die than ask him to come. ﻿Shit. ﻿Sima, it wasn't Yom Tov who called them. - Forget about it, Eli. ﻿It wasn't Yom Tov, it was me. ﻿Yefet was on my case and I... I couldn't help it. ﻿I called them and left a message. ﻿I didn't think they'll do anything about it. ﻿Sima. ﻿Sima, say something. Sima! ﻿I didn't know he'd get arrested. You think I'd have done it if I knew? ﻿Sima... Sima! ﻿Sima, say something. ﻿Why are you combing your hair right now? Sima? ﻿Yom Tov, the house is flooded, a pipe exploded. ﻿Yefet was arrested and there's no one to fix it. We can't sleep in there. ﻿What did he do? - What does it matter? ﻿So you want to sleep here tonight? - I can't leave her alone. She's in bad way. ﻿She almost bought alcohol today. Come on, come over. ﻿Sit down. I want to talk to you. ﻿Eli! Come here! Sit down. -What? ﻿You have to understand. ﻿When we were together that's how your mother kept bringing me home ﻿Something always needed fixing, and I came to fix it and stayed. ﻿She didn't break anything. It happened. A blockage. ﻿She asked for a plumber, not for you. ﻿I wanted you to come. She was against it but I convinced her. -Eli, stop it. ﻿Enough. -What did I do? - Stop interfering! ﻿You don't know what she's capable of when she wants something. ﻿And when she does, her manipulations grow. ﻿It's not like that, Yom Tov. - You have no idea... ﻿You have no idea how far she can go. ﻿She made fake suicide attempts. Took pills. ﻿I'd take her to the hospital, take care of her. ﻿Look after her, and she liked it. ﻿It was like an addiction. I was addicted to it, too Even though I'm not like that. ﻿I was addicted to her action, to her drama. ﻿They weren't real, right? -What? - Her suicide attempts. ﻿Leave me alone. Don't you understand? ﻿I don't want to do this anymore. Enough! ﻿She has Yefet now. It's his turn. ﻿When I decided I wasn't responsible e madness quit bugging me and you know wh ﻿Nothing happened. The world didn't end. There other things in the world besides Sima. ﻿And you should do the same. ﻿Be more like me. ﻿Here. ﻿Drink this. ﻿You can drink one time. It won't make you an alcoholic. ﻿Who? ﻿How are you, Sima? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Do you know any cheap plumbers? ﻿Sima? Do you need something? - No. ﻿Is everything alright? - Everything's fine, never mind. ﻿It's fine. ﻿How much? - I don't need money. ﻿How about a blowjob for old times' sake? ﻿Fuck you and take your money. ﻿Who does she have to impress? Yefet's in jail. ﻿Me... She thinks I'm the devil himself. ﻿She has no reason to make an effort. ﻿When she used to get in that mood she'd be in a different world. ﻿Brushed her hair for hours and hours, all about herself... ﻿Hours on end... Brushing her hair. ﻿As if she wants to... ﻿Mom.. ﻿Mom.. ﻿Mom.. Mom! ﻿Mom, don't die. ﻿Mom. ﻿Mom, don't die. ﻿Sima... Sima! ﻿Sima! Sima.. ﻿Everything's alright, Sweetie. ﻿Not Sima, Mom. ﻿Go on, feed. Everything's okay. ﻿Eli... ﻿It never happened, okay? ﻿Good morning. - Good morning. ﻿Make breakfast, honey. I'm cleaning. ﻿Hello. - Hey. -Hi. ﻿Where are you? - At home, a bit tired. ﻿Are you coming to the production party tonight? ﻿They invited you. - You'll come with me. ﻿Besides, I don't want to be there alone with all those old guys. ﻿Maybe. ﻿No maybe. You're coming. Okay? ﻿Thanks for coming. ﻿I slipped up yesterday. ﻿After a year and a half of being clean. ﻿I took a hit yesterday. Just one. ﻿I'm starting to count the days from zero. I've been clean for half a day. We love you. ﻿Do you want to share the details with us? ﻿It happened last night. ﻿I did something I shouldn't have. ﻿What? ﻿I cheated on Yefet. ﻿Who with? ﻿What does that matter? I cheated on him. ﻿I cheated on Yefet, my love. ﻿The man who supported me through all the Steps, who believed in me, ﻿I cheated on him. ﻿I cheated on him, Simona. ﻿Are you going to Anna's? ﻿Yeah. ﻿He has a girlfriend. She's a sweetie. ﻿Has he been crying? - He hasn't cried in years. ﻿So good things are happening to him. ﻿Hello? - Yeah... ﻿Who's home? ﻿How did you get out? - I told you I have a great lawyer. ﻿You're amazing. - I missed you. ﻿How are you, fatty? ﻿Great. ﻿By the way, she cheated on you. With someone you know really well. -Eli... ﻿You can ask Simona and her friends, you can all do Step 9 together. ﻿What's he talking about? - He's confused. ﻿It's not what you think. ﻿Yefet, please... ﻿Leave her alone, stupid. Leave her. ﻿Go away! - Leave her alone! ﻿Simona! ﻿Come here. Get in the house. - Yefet... -Come here I say. ﻿Leave her alone! - Get off... Simona! ﻿Leave her alone, Yefet. - Move. ﻿Move, you bitch. Come here. ﻿Come here, stupid. - Yefet! ﻿Yefet, let go of me! Yefet! -Why? ﻿Why? -Leave her alone, Yefet. - Why? ﻿Stop it! Let her go. You're killing her. ﻿Why, Sima, why? ﻿Yefet! Stop! - Why, Sima, why? ﻿Yefet, enough! - Why, Sima? ﻿Why?! - You killed her, stop. ﻿Why, Sima? Why? - Yefet... ﻿I think that's the best possible solution. ﻿What happened, Eli? Why aren't you in school? ﻿I'm moving in with you. ﻿Get them out of here. I need quiet. ﻿Didn't you want me to sell your paintings? ﻿I told them everything about the phone calls and the business card. ﻿They loved it. ﻿Come here. What's wrong? ﻿Come here. - What? ﻿What happened? ﻿I'm moving in with you. - No. I'm flying to Berlin. ﻿They want to give me a show, those dummies. ﻿I'll house-sit for you. ﻿Stop it. Inside Sima's a good person. ﻿A good mother, that is. Forget everything I said last week. I was drunk. ﻿Isn't she a good mom? That's the most important thing. ﻿It's you she always loved. ﻿She and I didn't get along. Big deal. Never mind. ﻿But she always loved you, gave you everything you needed. Always. ﻿She's a good mom. ﻿What happened? - Nothing happened! ﻿Something happened. - I'm unhappy. ﻿Enough. You want me to get involved with her again? ﻿Good things are happening. ﻿Finally something good is happening to me. ﻿What's up, lucky charm? - Fine. ﻿I'm taking Sima's place. ﻿Listen, listen. Stop. ﻿You're going to school like a regular kid, because I'm done ﻿with everybody doing whatever they feel like doing, clear? ﻿Fine, I'll go to school and I'll move in with you. ﻿Here, need money? - I don't want your 200 shekels anymore. ﻿I want to work here like you. ﻿Go home, Eli. ﻿Don't put me between your mother and father and don't put yourself there. ﻿Go. ﻿Fuck you. ﻿How are you, beautiful? ﻿You know I really wanted you to get the role. ﻿Yeah? Thanks. - I discovered Niv Rigger. ﻿Wow, she's a star. ﻿How about we go downstairs and have a little coke? ﻿Eli! He's my friend. - Friend like a boyfriend? ﻿A partner? - Yeah. ﻿What's up? Good to see you. ﻿What did that skank want from you? ﻿She's full of shit. ﻿What's going on? ﻿I can't deal with Sima. ﻿Whatever. When we get back my dad will be drunk. ﻿What are you drinking? ﻿Vodka. ﻿Want some? ﻿Bring me arak. ﻿Fine. ﻿Give me a hug. ﻿Never mind a hug. ﻿Hey. She needs to swallow, don't mess up the seats. ﻿Shut the fuck up, asshole. - Your mother's an asshole. ﻿Are you okay, Eli? ﻿Get out of the cab. - Wait a second. ﻿Out! You too, slut. - Fine, shut up. ﻿Get out. - Ok, stop. ﻿Eli, Eli. - Get out of the cab. ﻿Eli, Eli... Eli, calm down. ﻿Eli, don't. Eli, stop it. Eli! ﻿Stop! Stop! Stop! - Hey! Hey! ﻿Come here, you son of a bitch. - Eli, you'll kill him. ﻿Son of a bitch! - Stop it! Enough! ﻿Move! Come here, you son of a bitch. ﻿You bastard. ﻿Come here you bastard, you son of a bitch. ﻿Eli, listen... Eli, wait, we need to talk. No, Eli, wait. We need to talk. Wait. Eli... ﻿Look, Eli, I saw death too many times in my life. ﻿God loves me, otherwise he wouldn't have given me so many chances in life. ﻿Look, I'm sorry for the other day. ﻿I apologize. I'm ashamed. It was like a bad dream, I... ﻿I wasn't myself, Eli. I... ﻿It haunts me. ﻿Nothing happened, right? ﻿Nothing happened? - I'm human and humans make mistakes. ﻿I'm asking you to forgive me. ﻿Listen to me, Eli. I got my punishment, ♪ I paid the price for my sins. ﻿Please forgive me. ﻿That's the most important thing in the world for me. ﻿Step 9. Please, Eli. Wait, wait. I'm begging you. ﻿I apologize for what happened. ﻿Listen, God punished me when I was a child. ﻿I had crazy parents. My mother was a psycho. My father beat her up. ﻿He used to hit me too. ﻿Forgive me. ﻿Eli, wait. - Don't touch me. ﻿He once locked me in my room for four days... ﻿Stop it! - Without food or water. ﻿Stop it! - I drank my own piss. ﻿Stop it! ﻿Affirmative. I got it, thank you. - Hey, hey... ﻿Back away, please. -What's going on here? What happened? -Nothing. ﻿Stay back. No passage through here. ﻿Behind the tape, please. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Some drug addict committed suicide or something.
