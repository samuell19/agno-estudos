They cannot even trust each other, how could space people trust humans? They can only relax in their graves. Anything is possible... You. Did you lose your human heart? Anything is possible in this world.

Something is strange. Hey. Don't stick such a thing on the Buddha. You better leave now. Honey. Who the hell is he? His body is changing. He is dangerous. Let's get out of here. No. To protect this Buddha is my job. It's my family's duty. I cannot fail. Certainly not while my mother is alive. What a weird dog. Beniko Do you live here? Yes. Anything wrong? Where are my parents? Enju Poor beniko... Beniko. Do you recognize me? I came to see your parents. It's been a long time. I can't believe what I'm seeing. Beniko. You might not want to hear this, but... I know of a very similar case that happened before. What does that mean? Well, calm down. In fact, there used to be a group called seaddattha. They said that they have a mission to save... Buddha statues from disrespectful modern people. Then they stole Buddha statues. If they tried to re-sell, we could of found them. But their purpose was not for money. They were trying to collect all of the statues to protect them. And they kept stealing. Most of the stolen statues are gone and haven't been found. But... If that's true, how did they move such a big statue so quickly? That's the point. They move statues using a device. It's called the matter transference device. By using it, they can move an item to anywhere in an instant. Suppose they came to your parents' temple, and your parents died trying to save their statue. Only the device could cut their bodies like that. That's awful. So, where are they right now? We shouldn't talk about this anymore. Listen, beniko. Won't you stay in my temple for a while? It will be hard to live alone. I don't want to be any trouble. No, not at all. You can stay as long as you want. Enji, my grandson will be happy. Let's take your grandma back to the hospital. Then you can pack up your belongings and come to my place. Welcome to my temple. I'm sorry to scare you. In fact, they are deprived kids. Because they look different from others, their parents abandoned them. I'm taking care of the people who have no relatives... Until one becomes an excellent monk. Put on these slippers. Hi. "PC n” We're here. Use this room as you want like it's your room. I'm going back to work. Won't you walk around and check out the temple? I will. Thank you for everything. Hey, what's up? I'm sorry. I heard the sound and I... It's okay. Never mind. So what are you doing here? You don't look like others in here. Excuse me. I am beniko. I lost my parents yesterday. I am from kyozen-ji temple. I was invited by enju, a longtime friend of my parents. Pleased to meet you. Is that so? I'm sorry. I'm eniji, a Buddha statue sculptor. Enji I'm eniji, a Buddha statue sculptor. Enji you can stay and see my work. What are you doing? There you go. What's going on? Didn't you hear about the transference device? Yes, I did. Seaddattha used it for stealing statues... That's right. Sometimes they throw away mistransferred statues. Mistransferred? If an animal or a thing is near the statue, they get transferred together and are fused into one. Luckily, since he was in uchiguri of a wooden statue, he could survive. What's "uchiguri"? Oh, you don't know it? It's an inner curving of a statue. This hollow reduces the weight of a statue. Uchiguri this hollow reduces the weight of a statue. Uchiguri uchiguri moreover, it adjusts the humidity of the wood and... Uchiguri uchiguri prevents deformation. Fortunately this dog was trapped in there. What could happen if... The dog didn't get to the uchiguri? In that case, it will be fused completely with the statue... Hey, watch out. We're fine now. It was close though. What a naughty dog. Your name is big bang from now on. I heard they saw some smoke here. It's alright now, grandpa. You should go to bed. Oh, good. This wooden temple is easy to catch on fire. So be careful. I'm sorry, grandpa. I should go back and sleep. Okay. Good night. Good night. Sleep tight. Oh no... I cannot find my room. No way. I cannot believe it. Did my parents get fused with a Buddha statue? I don't understand. Just shut up. I'm a guard of this room. I was just looking for my supper, you know. How dare you sneak in here. Shut up. I never wanted to be here. That fire could have ruined everything. Enji could destroy the workshop. Doesn't he know about your plan? No, he doesn't know anything. Besides, that seaddattha might have started to act again. That's more serious. They'll come to steal my Buddha statues. Bad news, enju sir. The girl escaped. She probably saw that thing. Wh... what? I should've been more careful. What the hell were you doing? Catching a bloody rat? Grandma... "Kitamura hospital” "Ms. benira” "Ms. gunn" "benira"” Grandma, come with me. We've got to run. What are you doing in such a time? Doctor, she is benira's granddaughter. Oh, I see. What's going on? Doctor, nurse, please help us. Our lives are in danger. What are you talking about? It's best for your grandma to stay here. You've got to put her down. No. What's happening? No... don't... Beniko, let's go back to enju. Let's defeat seaddattha. I don't care about them. Leave me alone. I'm so confused. Me too. It's hard to tell which is good and which isn't. But I can tell one thing for sure. They started stealing Buddha statues again. That's a bad thing. Then, why are my parents in your temple? And all the statues. I think you are the thief. That's a funny story, but you should stop now. I can force you to come, you know? No, let me go. That was close, wasn't it? Now, come with me. Anish/ thank you. You saved our lives. But, who are you? No time for chatting. We better get going. Follow the guys over there. They will carry your grandma. I'll take care of the mess. Good morning. Well, let's save that for later. Seaddattha's secret facility Aren't you the... Right. We're seaddattha, the Buddha protectors. I'm the first female fighter of seaddattha, bosako. Bosako I'm the first female fighter of seaddattha, bosako. Bosako why do you steal Buddha statues? My parents became... Wait. We never steal Buddha. We protect them. Cut off that crap. Collecting other people's statues for yourselves means stealing. That's a misunderstanding. As you say, sometimes we commit crimes. But, that's... That's only because we have to protect the statues... From much a bigger organization than us. They never stop stealing, and we have no idea what their purpose is. The only thing we know is they are trying... To do something very big. Who are they? Stop right there. Shi-senior stop right there. Shi-senior shi-senior. Shi-senior? What the hell... Where is my grandma? Give her back. Calm down. I'll show you where she is. Do you know enju, shi-senioror? Yes, very much so. You said you found a Buddha statue that looks like your parents. Yes. I saw only their heads though. I see. That must be your real parents. Enju has been experimenting with the transference device. Do they have the device, too? Yes. Actually, they are the ones who developed it. We are monks. We used to work for enju. He used us to test the device, deformed our bodies and abandoned us. Half of us became seaddattha. What happened to the others? He keeps the little ones as his servants. They're easy to control. And while putting all of the blame on us, he keeps stealing a great number of Buddha statues. He's a real bastard. He pays no mind to the victims. I operated many of his experiments as an engineer. I also accepted money for it. But, to tell you the truth, I forgot the reason why I was helping him. You forgot? I'm made of three Buddha statues and four humans. An insect might have been trapped, too. He used me for transferring and fusion tests many times... Until I became like this. He is now acting like a good guy. He never told anyone the purpose of collecting statues. But I know one thing that is for sure, he was trying to perfect the fusion. If we don't stop him, all the Buddha statues will lose their genuine soul. He needs a skillful wood carving artist to complete the fusion. Enji... Enji, his grandson. He is a pro of uchiguri carving. If we don't complete the uchiguri fusion first, he will... I remember enji was talking about that. Uchiguri only applies to wood statues. Unlike fusion with bronze statues, if it's wood, uchiguri carving artist could release your body later. I mean, there is no use for a body like mine. We need a human who would fight against enju. Do you want me to do it? Well, obviously I cannot ask you to do that. Anyway, you better keep an eye on eniji. He is enju's grandson after all. But... He didn't look like a bad guy. Here we are. Grandma. In fact, benira also has known them. We assisted enju's experiments together. I don't know if your parents knew that though. She is on a training journey in between life and death. She can be called "virtual Buddha" trying to be a real Buddha. She is in training... That's why she never wakes up. Shi-senior, they have found us. Give us permission to combine. Wait a minute. We need more information first. Call the other four. Roger. Beniko, you are going to hide with your grandma. Take this. Come on. Why are you taking enju's side? For him, you are no more than his pets. Is that what you want? You should come with us. I don't want to hear a thing from runaway cowards. We shaved off all the wastes with effective fusion many times. We are made by nothing but capable parts. We are not like you, messed up Buddha men. You are inferior fake buddhas. What an insult. No mercy on you. We've got to combine our bodies. It's not a fusion. Five monk combination! Five monk combination That will make your bad quality even worse. You shall see. Hi, beniko. You are seeing me because I am no longer alive. You could think that I am in a real training. Now you are the only mortal who knows about enju's fusion test. Will you train as a virtual Buddha with benira? She is too young to die, but too old to be a virtual Buddha. When you finish training with benira, go to enju. Please reform him. Now, make up your mind. Put in your hand in the hole. What is this? Do I have to shave my head? Grandma has such long hair though. Her hair just grew while she was sleeping for 20 years. Okay, alright. I am going to shave. I never thought of becoming a monk. How divine you look. Beniko. Beniko. Haven't you found her yet? How deep their obsession is. What is enju trying to do? Feels so good. It's a shame. Beniko, you are the last hope. I can tell. My grandpa and his followers have gone nuts. I've got to stop them. No kidding! Is she my grandma? But, she is too young. I've never seen you before. Who are you? I see. She has been sleeping since before I was born. She doesn't know me. What are you saying? Grand... Benira, you have been in training for 20 years, right? What? I have only been here for two hours. Nothing has started yet. But in the mortal world, 20 years has past. That's impossible. I also have no idea what's going on. Well then, we are comates. Maybe you are here to help with my training. Let's start. I have to reform that enju bastard. Did shi-senior tell you so? Shi-senior? You mean shi-dunior. That's right. He suffered from enju so badly. This virtual Buddha world is fully monitored by shi-junior. In fact, he just passed away. No. He is only in his mid-50's. You must be kidding. He is in training in the real Buddha world. Anyways, I have to say that time flows differently here. Although I just came, I want to get out of here. I'm not a fool. But, I guess I should trust you. If what you are saying is all true, I'll wake up in the mortal world with white hair on my head. It'll be worse than that. Don't say any more. Now, come this way. This is where I came from. We could go back from here, too. You fool. I knew you were trying to set me up. It's obvious that shi-junior sent you to test me. That's not true. Let me go. I'm your granddaughter. I don't have any. I must get out of here somehow. It has been about 5 minutes since I got here. So... Several days have past in the mortal world. Oh, no. I've got to hurry up. Hey. Hey! That's beniko's voice. Anishi-. I'm here. Help! Is that you, beniko? Seeing you here means... Are you also dead? No. Shi-senior told me to train here. But, I'm confused. And I saw my young grandma. What kind of training am I supposed to do? I understand. If that's the case, being here means totally different for you. Benira and us, the 5 monks, are here because we're dying. But, you came here of your own will. That's a whole other story. You're already one step closer to a Buddha in the mortal world. You'll become almost as good as enju after proper fusion. I got it. I'll get out of here and try proper uchiguri fusion. That's the spirit. Now what are you going to do? We cannot fight anymore. Even if we return, we'll only waste the world's life capacity. We'll train here and wait for our next life. I see. Thank you for everything, 5 monks. I'll change reality so you didn't die for nothing. I like that. Okay. So long beniko. Wait. I'm going with you. Benira. You'll be an old woman when you wake up. Hi, beniko. I was watching your training. I'm embarrassed. Also I was impressed by benira's 20 years of training. What? Grandma? What happened to my body? This is not mine. I didn't train to get this doddering body. Well, although your body has waned, you must have improved your spirit level quite a bit. 1.2 times higher than the average for your age. 1.2 times. That's amazing. That explains why I feel so calm now. Let's get down to business. You came back to this life after the training. Do you know what's next? Yes. Yes. We're ready. Excellent. We're going to do this one by one. We'll do releasable advanced fusion, uchiguri. That's fine. Benira, you're the first. Choose one wooden Buddha statue you like. I like this one the best. I'll defeat enju's inferior fusion with this. Good. I like that. How beautiful. We did it. I wanted to test on you before young beniko tries. Now beniko, it's your turn. Okay. I'm scared to be fused with a Buddha statue. But, I'll do it. Where did beniko go? That seaddattha. But my spiritual level is 3.4 times higher than an average old man. I can keep on waiting here without been disturbed. That's right, sir. Meanwhile, I shall fuse to another Buddha, prepare for the battle. Having too much fusion doesn't mean anything. Grandpa, you've got addicted to fusion with statues. You just don't get it. I know all about uchiguri fusion. But that's not good enough. I'm aiming to go to a much higher place. This is only the beginning of my plan. You, foolish kid will never understand this. Enough. You cannot fuse anymore. I warn you as your grandson. Anymore fusion will impair your mind. Cut it out. It's time to visit enju. This is not revenge. We'll reform him. That's right. I'll be watching you right here. We shall go now. "Enkei-fi temple" grandma, go up on the roof and watch. Sure thing. Come beniko. Our temple master is waiting for you. No way. I came to get my parents back. Won't you bring them here. Impossible. You must come. I don't exactly know her but she is my granddaughter. Wait, grandma. We didn't come here for killing. It is easy to just kill them. But no one can get out from their suffering that way. So, please don't. Beniko. How brave of you to walk right through the front gate. Enji. Beniko, don't get closer. They forgot the real teaching of the Buddha already. All they care about is to become superior life forms... By fusing with statues. Then I really have to reform them. Thank you for everything till yesterday, enju. Now you must let enji go. I'm afraid I cannot, beniko. And you're going to pay for the room charge. I never said you could stay here for free. You give me no choice... Let enji go or I'll cut his throat with this heat ray. You once practiced buddism, you cannot just watch him die. How dare you do that to me. Alright then. I'll give enji to you, but this is a trade off. What? If you want your parents back, you got to come over. He is sick. Poor guy. He's going to pay back big time in the afterworld. Quit mumbling and help me, would you? Sorry, grandma. Enji. Shi-senior and I were fools to suspect you. Never mind. Anyways, about my grandpa... Watch behind youl! Thanks big bang. You are still here. Big bang, you saved my life. But this is not your place. Grandma... No time to be sad. I'm going inside with him to get ready to burn down the temple. You have to defeat enju and find your parents. Yes. Thank you, eniji. Dad, mom, where are you? Beniko. Beniko, kill us. I cannot. What should I do? Beniko. We won't be able to get out from here. Please eliminate us from this world through your power. I can't do that. There must be a way. I guess you cannot save your parents. Why don't you fuse with me... So that we can live as a super divine existence? Such a thing doesn't exist. I'm sick of all the worthless Buddha statue maniacs like you. You're misunderstanding me. I'm not just a statue collector. I have a very clear reason for doing this. Lower level existences like you wouldn't understand though. Did I make it? Grandma, don't force yourself. I guess this is it for me. Think of this as the only result of my 20 years of training... What a shame. No, it's not. You protected me from a man's dirty desire. Thank you, grandma. Mother... thank you. You saved beniko. Quit been a wimp. That's your job to take care of her. I'm counting on you. Next year, I... How unfortunate. Seems like this statue recognized your father... As a nuisance and eliminated him. I'll be the next. You have to kill me with this statue, beniko. No. I cannot... There is no use in waiting while beniko is completely lost. Beniko. No. How cruel. The game is over. Mercy of Buddha? Not this case. There is no mercy for you. I will kill you. Sounds fabulous. Now kill me as you want. Kill me and burn down the whole temple. I wonder if beniko's alright. Listen, big bang. As soon as beniko's out, we're going to burn down everything. Come and kill me. I don't think so. If you die, you'll be tried in hell. That's too easy. I'll keep you alive and torture you forever. Nevertheless you cannot let me do this forever, can you? Come on. Kill me if you can. That was a nice turn. Okay. I'll Grant your wish. Beniko girl. I'll finish everything now. Thank you, beniko. Hey, beniko. This is it. Go, big bang. Now get out of here. Shall I release your body? Yes, please. There are many strange things happening in this world.
