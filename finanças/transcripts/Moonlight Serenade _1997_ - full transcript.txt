KOBE IS ON FIRE I saw the same sight many years ago. One night, 50 years ago. Kobe was on re after an air raid. I'd just turned 10. I didn't understand the horror underlying the blaze. I was simply fascinated by the beautiful glow. It's hell in that fire. - You, too? - Me, too. - Yours got hard, too? - Yeah, mine's getting hard. Brother, what's getting hard? - My pee-pee. - Idiot! A kid octopus was born yesterday Struck by a bullet He died an honourable death in battle When are the Octopus's ashes coming home? Too bad he had no bones Nothing remains to come home Come back here. Keita! It's a bomb! By the lighthouse! It landed near the lighthouse. Another last-minute bird-dropping from a B-29. Fire! Fire!

Special Appearances: Naoto Takenaka Masahiro Nishimura Shima Iwashita Directed by Masahiro Shinoda - Hideko, come change your clothes now. - Sure, Mom. Koji. - Keita, are you home? - Yes. Sit down. You'll be responsible for your brother Tadao's ashes. Never, ever let them out of your hands during the trip. You must protect them. Got that, Keita? - Let's get ready. - Right away. Got that, Keita? The future of the Onda Family is in your hands. I'm counting on you. Why do you say that suddenly? No, let me go! Don't say no. Be good to your parents. No! Let me go! A kid octopus was born yesterday Struck by a bullet He died an honourable death in battle When are the Octopus's ashes... What're you singing to your brother's ashes? I'll beat that rotten spirit out of you. You can't just slap him whenever you want. Times have changed. You're falling behind the times. It'll stop, anyway, before we come home. I'm guarding these bones and ashes with my life. - I'm taking them to Miyazaki, in Kyushu. - Kyushu? My mom said your family isn't taking a trip. She said you were going to commit family suicide. - Family suicide? - Family suicide, it is. - That's so cool. - So cool! I've been looking for you. Come on, now. They're ready to take our photo. They want a commemorative photo just because they're taking a family trip. What a strange world. Officer Onda says they're taking Tadao's ashes to a temple in his hometown. - Tadao's ashes? - Yes. How foolish. When everybody's facing such hard times, who would want to take a leisurely family trip? This family, our clients, sir. The rumour mill has been churning. - A family suicide, they say. - A family suicide? Idiot, be quiet! On a lonely lake in the mountains... - Hey, Koji. - What? Tell me... What's a family suicide? Think about it. Officer Onda is one stiff tight-ass. And he wants to take a family portrait? Why would he want to do something so ostentatious? It's quite suspicious. If you put it that way, yes. It's always been difficult to guess what's going on in his mind. - Thanks for waiting. - We're sorry to keep you waiting. I'll be stationed here for about 10 days while Officer Onda is away. I'm Yamashita. I sincerely request your cooperation. Thank you. Looking forward to working here. Ready for you, sir. It's out of focus. - It is out of focus. - Idiot. It's difficult. It's upside down. Don't I always tell you? What's real is in here, what you see upside down. All the rest is fake. When you think like that, you're a pro. - Look. - I forgot. Wow, I see. Now I see. Wow, I see. Now I see. Are you ready? Relax your shoulders... Are you ready? Relax your shoulders... Smile broadly. Are you ready? Okay, shall we go? I'm taking the picture now. One plus one equals... Smile! It's creepy to think those are bones rattling in here. What are you saying? It's your brother in there. But it's bones. It's still your brother. It's his bones and ashes, but it's him. These are very difficult times for the whole country. We hired a limousine. We're taking a family trip. I wonder what the Police Department and our neighbours think... Either we have no common sense or we're selfish, they must think. What's wrong with taking our son's remains to a temple in our hometown? I got prior permission from my supervisor to leave. All the neighbours are whispering about us. "A family suicide," they say. Cast the dice. Thanks so much. I'm the banker now. Place your bets. - Here you go. - There. - I win again. - I lost again! You're really handsome. You bring me good luck. Am I good luck? Squeeze my hand real tight again. Place your bets. Let's go. Come on. Here we go! Come on... Is that your homework? Something like that. I'm drawing Awaji Island. I was drafted into war labour and couldn't go to middle school. Like our older brother, you're a scholar. Why am I the only one who's not smart? You're so right. I'm the plaything of a war widow. Who's that flappy red goldfish? Look, I got a gift from the flappy red goldfish widow. It's tasty. A steamed bun with real bean jam. See? You've never seen one of these, have you? I don't want a bun like that. You're still a kid. Don't try to be stoic for your pride. Eat what's delicious. I'm not being stoic for my pride. You must eat. Eat this, or you won't survive in the new Japan. Don't be stoic about a bun. It's nothing. - You'll end up like Dad. - What do you mean? Never mind. I'm going to run away before this trip's over. I'm telling this only to you. Don't tell Dad or Mom. Promise me, man-to-man. You mustn't run away. - I'm going to. - You mustn't. Die with us. Idiot! Hey, we've been waiting for you. KOBE - SUMOTO AWAJI ISLAND FERRY PORT Watch out. Keita. Keita! Take Koji's hand. Listen, everyone, don't get lost. Hold onto your belongings. Don't let them go, even if someone bangs into you. One guy refused to let go. "Over my dead body!" The thief chopped off his hand and took the bag, I heard. We're walking to the Station. If we catch a night train at Kobe Station, we can get to Miyazaki tomorrow. Let's go. Keita. The way we're going, we'll all be dead before we get to Miyazaki. Wait a second! Don't take a hand-out. Take them back! Dear. OUMI PUFFER-FISH STEW We Japanese women were stunned and at a loss after World War II. What does suffrage mean to us? Truly, now is the time to ask and answer this ourselves. - There are thoughtless men. - Come on. They claim that women have no sense of self. They say giving voting rights to women is like throwing pearls before swine. No train service is available now. We're not selling tickets. Train service is not available now. Dear, let's go back to Awaji. Let's go back before the children get injured or sick. Don't talk silly. How can we do that? We arranged a limousine when we left home, so I know it wouldn't look good. Don't say, "Limousine, Limousine." - Don't be stubborn. - I'm not stubborn. I'm taking off for now. I'll be back in an hour. Stay here. Don't move from this spot, no matter what. Koji, I'm counting on you. Mom, why don't you sit down? He has to decide everything all by himself, all on his own. Come here. Here. And here. Enjoy it now. Life is harsh in the city. This trip is crazy. Dad should admit it so we can go home. When are you running away? Damn, not so loud. Come on, when? Soon. When no one's looking. Tonight, watch out. But don't tell anyone. You'll abandon your family? It's my life. Dad hates me. I hate Dad. Nothing good will come of it if I stay with him. We lost the war. The world has changed. Everything that used to be has all fallen apart. Everything Dad believes is right, is wrong to me. Our brother Tadao was earnest. He wanted to please Dad. He volunteered. Now look at him, rattling around in this box. What're you doing? Don't hit him! This rough trip to bring him to Kyushu won't atone for Dad's sins. You're my brother. You mustn't run away. The Onda family will be in good hands with you. Let's go to Kyushu together. - I'm running away. - You mustn't. Consider me dead, okay? Hey, there, handsome young man. Why don't you party with me? What're you doing? Come on. Come on, party with me. No, thanks. - Cheapskate! - Whore. Don't take us for fools, stupid! It's here. I'm sure. - Hello. - Welcome, sir. We have guests, madam. We have guests leaving. Coming. Welcome. I'm Honda. Officer Matsubara of the Prefectural Police told me... Oh, yes, he told me. Please come on in. Thank you very much. Come again. We'll spend the night here. Tomorrow, we'll sail for Beppu in Kyushu. A ship will be better than a train. Come on. This way, please. Let me carry it. I've never been in an inn before. Now I can die content! Keep your mouth shut. They'll think I'm a country bumpkin, too. Hideko, get dressed for bed. What a cheap love hotel. - Brother - What? You know that Miss Flappy Red Goldfish? Was she a whore, too? No, she wasn't. A whore is totally different. You were drawing on the boat, too. What are you writing? - It's my suicide note. - Suicide note? It's my farewell note. I won't be around too long. I'm writing everything I see on the trip. And I draw pictures to go with the text. With pictures, too? I don't think it's called a suicide note. I'm gonna write, "Whore". - I told you, she wasn't a whore. - This makes it more fun to read. Are you putting lies in your suicide note? - Excuse me. - Yes? It's dinner. Can I open it? Ugh, pumpkin! Do we have to eat pumpkin at an inn? Yeow! Not pumpkin again! I'm sorry. Koji, have a cup of sake. Come on. Good evening. An American. He can't come in here. - Please, why can't you let him stay? - No, we can't. What's the problem? We can pay. It's off-limits to you. That girl's trouble. - You're in charge now. - Yes, ma'am. You mustn't run away. On behalf of the Gods in Heaven Smite the Immoral Royal and valiant Unrivalled are our soldiers Cheers of jubilation send them off Now they're leaving the land of their fathers and mothers They'll be victorious or they won't come home alive So they swear How brave are they in their hearts Cigarettes. Look here, I got American cigarettes. Lucky Strike. - How much? - 20 yen. Thank you very much. Aren't you handsome, young man? I'm falling in love with you! I can take you to a nice girl. A nice girl? For real? Yeah, for real. You won't regret it. Listen... What's with you? You got a girl with you? Who are you? Why are you following me around? It's dangerous for a girl to be out alone. This is a rough area. Listen, young man. She doesn't want you. Leave her alone. Young lady, if you hang around here, you'll get stripped naked and sold off. - None of your business. - Not so fast. Come here, kid. How dare you, kid! Who are you? Yukiko Minakami. I'm staying at the same inn as you are. I saw you leaving by yourself, so I followed you. Why? I don't know. I wonder why. And your folks? An air raid killed my whole family. In Kobe? So you're all alone? I've got relatives in Kyushu. I'm supposed to sail to Beppu tomorrow. But I'm wondering if I can survive alone by myself. It's not possible, is it? You're not alone. I feel the same way. I was just wondering if I should run away instead of getting on the ship to Beppu. - For real? - For real. Are you getting on the ship tomorrow? Tell me. My fate depends on your answer. I'll decide tomorrow. I want you to decide now. It stinks! Tell the inn Hideko did it. Wouldn't that be cruel to her? Boys mustn't be humiliated. Enough with your absurd reasoning. Girls mustn't be treated cruelly. A man's shame affects his value. A woman can say the same about herself. Men and women are different. - Give me tea. - Sure. You wet your bed, it won't dry soon. Are you still sleepy? Yeah, I didn't sleep at all. Where did you go last night? - I didn't go anywhere. - Then why didn't you sleep? Affairs of the heart. "The heart," get it? You mustn't run away. You're quite persistent, you know that? Good grief. "The Revised Constitution. "Article 9 renounces war as a sovereign right of self-defence. "It does not recognise the right of belligerency of the State, "Prime Minister Yoshida declared in the House of Representatives." Please watch out for yourself on your voyage. No matter what happens, don't let this out of your hands. Goodbye now. What's that? My entire fortune. I'm selling off the land my family used to live on. I'll be a freeloader with a dowry. So I see. I'm holding money here. You wanna be a robber? Don't kid around. With this money, I don't need to live on the good graces of my relatives. I can live on my own for a while. Have you made up your mind? You said you'd decide today. Did you? Is this going to Beppu? Yes. Please stand in line. What are these, Koji? They're mines. They'll explode if you touch them. Be careful. Was Brother Tadao killed by one of these? Yeah. Excuse me! Mine disposal is in progress in the harbour now. We'll be late leaving port. Please wait to get on-board for now. I'm sorry. Our apologies. I'm sorry. Mom! Where are you, Mom? Mom! Where are you? It doesn't look good. The second-class cabin is full. It looked like there were some seats available. If you bribe them. - It's not like we don't have money. - Idiot. I can't waste precious money bribing them. Well, we're here now. Koji found this spot and staked it out for us. It's a lot better than being exposed to the wind. - Here. - What a nice find! I found them over there. What's that Rising Sun symbol? Who told you you can smoke? Now we can take a breather. I'm going to explore the ship. Maybe there's a better place to sit. The world has changed. Don't you think people like Koji do better than people like you, dear? Don't be ridiculous. That'd be the end of the world. Koji. I looked everywhere for you. I thought I'd never see you again. This is first class. - What're you doing? - You can't come in. Let me go. Allow me. Thank you. The wind's picking up, isn't it? Ladies and gentlemen, it must be fate that brought us to spend the night here together. Let's make friends with each other and enjoy our time together. Don't be sullen and hug your knees and fall asleep. You'll freeze. You'll die. We'll be fine if we all drink and sing and have raucous fun together. Let's have fun. I got no choice. You never know when you'll run into misfortune. Here you go. Let's say I've met my end. Here's my contribution. A bottle of American whiskey. Premium, good stuff. American cigarettes, too. Whiskey! Have you ever seen a bottle of whiskey? Come one, come all. How about it? Come on, wake up, Baby Cedar The sun is smiling As it calls to Baby Cedar What good can a wee Baby Cedar do? Baby Cedar is shocked and stunned He shrinks back into the ground... Come on, have a drink. You're a black marketeer, eh? I'm a police officer in Awaji. I see. You're a police officer. As you guessed, I'm a black marketeer. I take what's on the right to the left, what's on the east to the west. I use my wits, I keep myself busy, and I make money. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a true, authentic black marketeer. Please do business with me. I don't like black marketeers. You take advantage of legal loopholes and hungry people. The way you make money is unforgivable. I crack down on you guys vigorously. I admire you, Officer. Japan is a wasteland now. It's great you're fighting for the law. "Times have changed," they say, but people change even more. Yet you're staying true to yourself. Let's drink to justice and peace in Japan. I see no reason to hear that from a black marketeer. For the first time since I was born, I drank with a black marketeer. He's so stubborn. In these times, it's gotta be hard to keep his honour as a stubborn and strict father. Yes, it's difficult in so many ways. You've got a good father. Don't you go astray. Teachers' and police officers' sons often go astray. - My brother's already gone astray. - Has he now?! Strange, isn't it? Us, I mean. Yeah, strange. I thought you were a spirit, either a fox or a snow lady. When I went back and went to bed, I figured: "She wasn't real... "She was a dream. She was a fox or a snow lady." I was being tricked. I don't understand it myself, either Understand what? Why I followed you all the way into the black market. Yeah? I feel like I've never seen a man as beautiful as you. I'm weird to say that, aren't I? But it's the truth. You wouldn't look good as a military man. There are no more military men. I thought, "He's so beautiful." Then, for some reason, I couldn't stay still. It's the same for me. You're beautiful, too. It must be fate. It's our destiny. Go to sleep now. Are you cold? A harmonica! Your harmonica is sparkling, brand-new. Come on, miss. Take a swig. No? Have a cup, Mr Demobilised. What a speedy drinker! Come on, come on. The future of Japan depends on fine young men like yourself. By the way, Mr Demobilised, what're your plans once you get to Beppu? I'm visiting the family of a fallen war buddy. I'd like to tell his surviving family about the last moments of his life. I see. It's a painful journey you're taking. "You were in the same troop. How did you alone survive?" That may be their question. It's all I think about. What a sad story. Can't you forget about it? Why do you have to go around only to be yelled at? Why do you have to apologise to them, "I'm sorry I survived"? Thank you. My plan is to become a geisha in Beppu. I learned to dance in Kobe. I can be popular. She's got the looks. She's got the voice. She sure is gonna be a star! Why do you want to be a geisha? For the money? Or did something happen to drive you to despair? Well, now. Let's not pry into personal affairs. We're only huddled together for the night to ward off the cold. I understand, though, Mr Demobilised, how you feel. I'd wonder, too, if it's only for the money. If so, I wouldn't mind taking care of her. I'm kidding, I'm just joking. I never meant to... I'm sorry for being intrusive. Oh, my, only a little is left. Officer, they say, "The last serving carries the luck". Have a drink. Maybe, like you said, I'm having a fit of despair. Maybe I'm thinking, I don't care what happens in the future. Yoshizo Yoshitake! Hurry! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to send him off. We're honoured. Now, now, are you a school principal? Have a drink, please. Your son's going to war. How glorious. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Who's Yoshizo Yoshitake? His son or his student. He must've lost him in the war. A mine! There's a mine! Mine ahead, 10 degrees starboard. Mine ahead, 10 degrees starboard. Got it. Bow. Hard aport. Hard aport. It seems the ship changed course suddenly. There was probably a floating mine. Don't make jokes in poor taste. We survived the war. We can't have our precious lives blown away now. By the way, you're carrying so much stuff. I'm a black marketeer and I have less. You hardly look like a black marketeer. Start. The moon is about to set on a pine forest at dawn. Every creature in nature breathes out a tiny white cloud in the cold spring air. Suddenly, the stillness is broken by sharp whistles. Breaking out of the tightening noose of police encirclement is a masked thief. A masked... Damn. Change it. - You're a silent film narrator? - Yeah. "You're under arrest!" "Damn policeman. Come closer and I'll kill you." A glistening blade slices through the air, followed by a crimson shadow. Lightning fast, sparks fly off colliding swords and steel. Wonderful! Great! We're carrying reels of film and a projector. After Beppu, I'll spend six months on tour around Kyushu. What movies are you carrying? I'd like to say it's an exhilarating sword-fighting movie. Unfortunately, the Occupying Forces have imposed restrictions. I've got The Life of Matsu the Untamed. Wow, the one with Bantsuma? Yes. It's a masterpiece of our times. It's guaranteed to fill the house wherever it goes. Hey, what does Bantsuma mean? Come on. Why don't you tell me? The boy can't speak. Forgive him. Tell me the truth. You do have a sword-fighting movie, don't you? My, my, how do you know? Just between you and me. General MacArthur banned all sword-fighting movies. I know a good thing when I see it. The audience is hungry for sword-fighting. They're starving for it. Wherever I go, I hide from the Americans and put on a show, and I get a full house. It's an illegal screening, but so what? The blockhead Occupying Forces chase us, we run, screen, and crisscross the country. We make a fortune in turbulent times and stuff the cash in an apple box. Stuff it in. Stuff more of it in. Step on it. Push it in with both hands. Still, dare I say I'm hopelessly outnumbered. I have so many apple boxes and they're not enough. Oops. Don't you have an amazingly smart mouth? Not that I can say I don't have the same problem. Show us. I want to see the movie. I want to see the movie. Movies are wonderful. Show us. It will help us forget the cold. I want to see it, too. A movie. I want to see it. I'd dearly love to show the film for you all. But I'm afraid, without electricity, movies can do nothing. We can find a power source. I can run cables, too. I used to be a handyman with a circus. Listen, don't you ever touch me now. You'll get electrocuted. THE LIFE OF MATSU THE UNTAMED I, Matsu the Untamed, will take you on. I'm free to cook and eat anything anywhere! That's right! He's right! Right? Isn't that so? You're a sensible man. I can cook in a theatre if I want. Open up. It's ready to eat. - What're they roasting? - Garlic. What? Can't you see? I'm cooking snacks to go with drinks. If you bother the other customers... I'm gonna kick you out. I'm cooking what I want to eat. How dare you complain? Cooking food inside a theatre isn't a popular thing to do. I don't know about a country theatre. But not in... Why did they cut a good scene? It's the Occupation Forces! It's their fault! - Please wait a moment. - It's not a sword fight! We'll start again soon. We'll be back in no time. What's wrong? I just need another shot of morphine. I'm okay. We're drenched. The way it's raining, it's just a shower. It'll be over soon. I've made up my mind... I'm going to my relatives in Nakatsu. You don't like me anymore? You don't know if your relatives will protect you, do you? Is that okay with you? It stopped raining. It's trying to draw me in. The sea makes me want to jump in. It's pitch dark out there. Will you die with me? For you, I can die. You asked me a question earlier. Do you want to hear my story? Don't worry about it. I wasn't myself earlier. I had a fiancé. Ever since I was little, I knew I'd marry him. He died on the Southern Front. He left no remains, no personal effects. I received the casualty notice. I completely lost the will to think. I was lost in a daze, wandering around town, when... I don't remember how it happened. I found myself... being abused by the Occupying Soldiers. They assaulted you? That's why I gave in to despair. To be honest, I want to kill myself. I'm as good as dead. I'm like a ghost. I'm not visiting bereaved families. I made that story up. I've survived shamelessly. I'm utterly disgusted with myself. I don't know what happened to you, but I'm coming with you. I can still be a geisha afterwards, if you leave me. He sent one student after another off to war, only to have them killed for nothing. And yet he had no way of atoning for his culpability. It all hit him up here, I think. We humans are too small to wrestle with the tide of the times. It's only sad when we try to shoulder the burden ourselves. Are you one of those people? It's the ashes of my oldest son. He was 19, killed in action. I see. Your son. We're travelling as a family to bury him in my hometown, Miyazaki. I see. I know it's absurd to take a trip at a time like this. But I have to. I must lay his ashes in the proper grave. I can't stay still. Otherwise, he can't rest in peace. Killed in action at 19. He volunteered, didn't he? Yes, when he was only 17. He was still a child. I didn't even try to stop him. I was the times. It's no one's fault. If I hadn't allowed him to volunteer, he'd still be alive. It's as if I'd killed him. Kid, put your hand out there. It's a sword fight! So long as it's projected on your hand, the Occupying Forces can't punish us. Bantsuma is fighting on my hand. Tonight's a special occasion. Don't tell anyone, okay? He's drawn his sword only to protect himself. Exhausted, Heizaburo feels his body drained of strength, as if made of cotton. He glares at the officers surrounding him. Amidst the feverish whirl of battle, he suddenly comes to his senses. What else greets his eyes but the countless bodies of dead men all around him. "Alas, I've finally killed men. "I've finally committed murder. "Alas, I have killed." Heizaburo throws away his sword and is captured at last. It was destiny that brought them together. Mr Demobilised doesn't seem interested, but Miss Beauty is serious about him. That young man seems to be hiding quite a story. Sometimes I can see real gloom in his eyes. You see through everybody, don't you? It's a shame you're a black marketeer. A black marketeer is my disguise in these turbulent times. In a few years, you'll find me as a respected politician. A lowlife will become a politician. That'll be the end of the world. I'm wildly strong in these tumultuous times. Lucky, as well. I'm living a happy-go-lucky life. Dad, where's the toilet? - That way. - Okay. You're thinking about resigning from the police, aren't you? Being a police officer is my vocation. But now you have doubts about your occupation as a police officer. Come on, idiot, can't you walk more slowly? How many times do I have to tell you? Come on. Good, good. Way to go. Good. Raise your leg. Good, good, good. Straight back now. What happened? Did you have a scary dream? I'm a child of the sea Where the white horses Merrily play on the rocky shore On which stands a pine forest Stop engine! Astern engine! What's this, the MP again? It seems they found a mine! Don't start rumours. We don't know yet. Please calm down. This is no joke. Mines are bad. I can't handle them! Didn't you say you were strong in these tumultuous times? I can't afford to die here and now. I value my life. I didn't survive the war for nothing. I'd hate to meet a "boom" and get blown away now. A happy-go-lucky future is waiting for me. Is it true there's a mine floating ahead? Huh? Yeah. It could be true. Is it the one that sank Brother Tadao's ship? Who knows? A mine doesn't know that the war's over. So true. Dad, that's a nice way to say it. It wasn't a mine. It seems someone jumped into the sea. They stopped the ship to search for him. It must be Koji... It could be Koji. What's wrong, dear? It's Koji. Koji jumped into the sea. - That's ridiculous. - I'm serious! I'll go look. Didn't Koji say something? - He did. - What did he say? That he'd run away before the trip was over. He said, "Consider me dead. "Don't tell anyone. Promise me, man-to-man." Man-to-man? Idiot! How dare you keep quiet about such an important thing? We don't know for sure yet. Don't do anything rash. Dear. Dear! My son could be dead for all I care. I'm sorry for causing a scene. You know, if you're worried, why don't you come with me to take a look? How old is your son? At the age to think about suicide? He's 18. I have no idea what's in his head. He's a weakling. As you may already know, there's been an accident. It's unclear at present who was involved. Is there anyone from among you who seems to have disappeared? Please check. You're not missing anyone, are you? This gentleman's worried his son might've jumped. What's his name? - Koji! - I'm so relieved. - Koji. I thought you might've committed family suicide. I was worried and concerned, so I rushed over. - Officer, you mustn't hit him! - Koji! - Dear. Dear. That's not the face of a weakling. I say he's good-looking. Where's Mr Principal? Since when has he been missing? Purser, we've found the shoes. Dear, we'll be entering the Bungo Channel soon. What should we do with Keita and Hideko? Let them sleep. How could he be killed in action on such tranquil waters? Tadao must've been exceptionally inept, don't you think? It wasn't a matter of aptitude. Then was he unlucky? I need to talk to you. What about? When we get off the ship, I want to go my own way. I could've run off without telling you, but I figured I'd better say a word... Don't talk nonsense. Wait a minute. I'm talking about my life. I can't stay with this family. I want to live free. The times have changed. Who's this? Her name's Yukiko Minakami. She's lost her parents in an air raid. She's going to live with her relatives. I want to accompany her. I want to make sure for myself that her relatives will properly take her in. Why do you have to make sure? Idiot. Her life is my life. I love her. I'm taking her to her relatives. If they're likely to make her unhappy, I'll go to Tokyo with her. If it looks like she'll be happy, I'll go to Tokyo and call for her someday. How immoral! There's no way I'll allow you. There's nothing immoral about it. It's the path Koji has chosen. You've thoroughly thought about it and made up your mind, haven't you? Idiot, what're you saying? Don't meddle in this! - Koji... - You must die with us, Koji. You mustn't run away. We're committing family suicide. Kojio and all of us have to die together, right? What a foolish thing to say! What would we want to do that for? What a foolish thing to say. What's wrong, kid? Keita... The remains in this box: is it a skeleton? No. Bones and ashes after cremation. Have you seen them? I've never seen them, but that's the way it is. Are they really in here? Can't you be quiet? It's true They make a beautiful sound. Say, don't you find it creepy to hold bones in your arms? Of course it's not creepy. It's our brother. It is creepy. They're bones. Hideko, don't you remember Brother Tadao? I don't know the brother who's turned into bones. I see. Then you find it creepy. They're just bones for you. You mustn't run away. Shut up. Stop! Don't move! Stop! Don't go. Don't get involved. Don't run! Stop! Stop! No! No! Let me die with him, please! Idiot! Don't talk nonsense. You sure I can go? But you must be there when we place Tadao's ashes in his grave. The entire family must be in Miyazaki. It's important. After that, you can run away, die a beggar, or do whatever you want. Got it? - Sure you're okay with it? - Yeah. We'll spend the night in Beppu tonight. You must be back here tomorrow morning before the train leaves for Miyazaki. You can run away if you want. Let's say you don't come back. Then you won't be my son anymore, got it? Tomorrow morning at 8:00 here. I'll be back. Keita, keep this for me. Dear, is Koji really coming back? How should I know? You came up with this. Go ask him yourself! - "Consider me dead." - You fool. I'm not going back. That'll be cruel. You've got to understand how your father and mother feel. Please go back to them. Unlike me, you have a family. I'm already free now. I can't worry about complicated things. I won't be able to leave my family. You're not the type to run away. That's not true. I've abandoned my family. I'm all yours now. - How about going to see a movie? - You mean it? Which movie? MR DEMOBILISED IN BEPPU CASABLANCA CASABLANCA They deliberately started a reckless war of invasion. They deliberately started a reckless war of invasion. They caused suffering in Japan, China and other Asian nations. - Hurry up, Dad. - They are the war criminals. The newsreel's started. Ex-Prime Minister Tojo and 28 defendants... - face the Military Tribunal now. - One adult and one child, please. Thank you for bringing her. Good bye. I have no idea... Will she be happy or not? I couldn't get a feel. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Have you already run away? I told them I'd walk you to the station. Were you crying? Of course I wasn't. Are you okay? The question is: are you okay? They seem pretty nice. Are you sure? Probably. I see. Then it's good bye. I love you. Hurray! Hurray! I missed the last train. I'm gonna run. What did that man say? There are too many difficult words. Be quiet for a while. Didn't you like it? I don't like American movies. What was it about? You're too young to know. That's not fair. That's really not fair. That's Mr Black Marketeer. You bastard...! Keita, go find a stick. A broom or a door rod from any store will do. A stick, I need a stick. Stop it! Oh, it's you. Don't interfere. It's just a fight. What you gonna do? Wanna fight us to save him? We'll take you on. They were all ready to die with bombs. None of them is scared of dying. He's got nothing to do with this. He was just passing by. Don't involve him. Go away, then. I don't get anything for beating up a worthless old man. Stop right there. Leave him with us. Old man, you mean it? Stop right there! Dad! You guys are no match for me. Run away before you get hurt. Dad is Bantsuma! Head! Oh, my, you're an incredible swordsman. - I'm speechless! - You're safe now. - Take this back. - They had nails on their soles. Those kids have no class. I won't ask you what the quarrel was about, but don't be too reckless. Thank you so much. I'd better be going now. Thank you. Dad... What happened with Mr Black Marketeer? Well, I don't know. I made it in time. I barely made it. Excuse me, the next train leaves at 7:45, doesn't it? No, they cancelled the night train tonight. You gotta be kidding... Tell me you're joking. Hello. You said you were going to Miyazaki. I knew you'd be here. You get around, don't you? - Take this. - What is it? A token of my appreciation for last night. Famous sake from this region. There's one bottle for you, and another for your son's grave. I went to a lot of trouble to get them. Please use it for your son. Dear, thank him and accept them. Keita, thank you for your help last night. Mister. Did you fight for her last night? You could say that. I bought her freedom as a geisha. Exercising your true talent as a black marketeer. What happened to your young lady-killer? Well, he ran off somewhere. What a troublemaker. He's running an errand to Nakatsu. He promised to be back before 8:00. Nakatsu? That's not good. All the trains have been cancelled that way since last night. It's too far away for your boy to make it. Delay your departure until tomorrow. I can arrange tickets somehow. I can't cause you any more trouble. We're leaving this morning. Dear, let's wait until tomorrow. If he wants to come back, he can. He promised, man-to-man. If he can't keep it... we can consider him dead. What a stubborn man! I'll take care of your boy. I'll find him and give him a ticket. Don't bother to butt in. How can you be so rude when he's being so kind? - Thank you. I'm counting on you. - Please rest assured. Take care of yourselves. - Bye. - Keita. WELCOME BEPPU HOTSPRINGS Hey, young man! Hey, wait! - I'm back! - Koji! I'm back. I'm back, as I promised. Koji! Brother! Koji! Mister, what're you doing here? Well, there's a story to that. What, you want a piece of me? Are you his dad? We brought Koji, your son. Okay? He made it in time? It's all good? You're welcome. A promise is very important, but you mustn't commit hara-kiri. Hara-kiri is a barbaric... custom. Hara-kiri? Me? Japanese people want to die too easily. Hara-kiri, kamikaze... barbaric... customs It's a bad thing to do. Japanese people think about dying too easily. But it's very important to live. To be happy. It's a wonderful thing. Shut your mouth! I don't want you to lecture me. What do you know about us? What's wrong with us Japanese thinking about death all the time? We're all living in shame. It kills us to be alive, but we're living. In a world where nothing makes sense, we've lived on the edge of life and death. We may have lost to you idiots, but I won't allow you to lecture us. He's a bit stubborn. Be careful around him. What should I do? Dad might lead them into a family suicide. It's fine. Don't worry. You kept your word. Don't worry. I promise. But what was all that about hara-kiri? I told them Dad would commit hara-kiri if I didn't make it by 8:00 as promised. I scared them to get on their jeep. You're something else! What a son! He's a genuine, authentic fool. What are you saying? He came back on time when no trains were running. Koji's going to be fine, isn't he? The black marketeer will take care of him. Now my brother isn't with us... we can't commit family suicide. Yeah? You're right. That's too bad, huh? Mr Keita Onda. Oops, I forgot Koji's bag. What a liar Brother Tadao is. "It's his bones, it's his remains." It turns out it's just a toothbrush. I looked at Mom then. The urn only contained a toothbrush. "Maybe she'd known it all along?" That's what I wondered then. LET'S REBUILD KOBE - What are these, Koji? - They're mines. They'll explode if you touch them. Be careful. Was Brother Tadao killed by one of these? Yeah. PASSENGER WAITING AREA Yeah. PASSENGER WAITING AREA PASSENGER WAITING AREA I'm sorry. Mine disposal is in progress in the harbour now. I'm sorry. Mine disposal is in progress in the harbour now. We'll be late in leaving port. - You know, my house was fine. - Oh, really? - My neighbour's house was destroyed. - Really? Your neighbour's? My house was partially destroyed. It's still a shelter from the rain, though. Maybe that's good enough. But, you know, I had no idea when the tremor would stop. So true. I had no idea. But this... - So much damage. - We clean up and there's no end to it. Head! Head! Subtitles transcribed and timed by lordretsudo A Masahiro Shinoda Film THE END
