It's just me. Don't be scared. It's just me. - I tried to tell her... - Can you hear me? Hello? Did you invite me? I didn't know I was here... Who's there? I'm sorry, what are we doing here? Who are you? Sanzaru. Is that your name? Mr. Sanzaru? Sanzaru! Auntie... Yeah? She fell on the floor. She was trying to get into my room. What? Move, move. Dena? Dena. What are you doing here? Go get the strap. It's in the chair in there. Okay, I'm gonna sit you up, okay? One, two, three. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Are you hurt anywhere? I was looking for my charivari. There was a boy sleeping in Clemy's room. Here, under, under. Here. Okay, one, two... ...three Okay. He shouldn't be in that room. Shh. You okay? Yeah. Up already? - Morning. - Good morning. Let me check. Oh... sorry, cold hands. Okay. One... One, two, three. It's too hard this week. Hmm. What's the clue? "Harmony, as in music." Melody. Ten letters. It might start with a C. Consonance. C-O-N-S-I-N... Consonance. C-O-N-S-O-N-A-N-C-E. Consonance. It works. When does your brother get back from school? - What? - Your brother, when does he get off school? He's been taking things again. What are you trying to say, Dena? Oh, dear. I'm sorry. I'm frightening you. It's okay. Was I rambling again? Just a little. I'm sorry. Don't get old. - What is it, Dena? - I... I'm sorry. - Be patient with me. - It's okay. I was going to say something, but I can't find the words. They're... inside me. I can feel them. But... Do you want to listen to your music? Yes, please. ♪ Everything Every little thing... ♪ Moe? Hello? Dena? Child... Hello? Hello? Hello? Sister, it's me... Hey. No word from the school yet? - I can barely hear... - Is that Mom? - Hold on... - Okay. - Hey. - Hey there, buster. - You didn't call me back. - Sorry. - You doing your schoolwork? - Yeah. - You've got to do all those workbooks. - I will, Mom. How's it going there? - It's fine. - Yeah? - I know this is hard, but hang in there. - Yeah. I love you. Okay, you too. - It's all gonna work out, okay? - Okay, bye. Well, doesn't he seem enthusiastic? He just went for another run... Oh, yeah? Did you hear yet from the school? No, but I know they're pinning it on him. The other kid only got suspended for two weeks. What?! That's all? Yeah. But, hey, I wanted to let you know I'm going to be staying with Gary for a while. What do you mean? In Dallas. So you're moving there? For a while, yes. What about Moe? I'm not going to wait around anymore. He broke the kid's nose. It was sport! They were playing a sport... Yeah, and he sent the kid to the hospital. Amos is going to be expelled. I think we should just face up to that. He can't stay here... What's he going to do? You figure this one out. He's your responsibility now. I can't right now. They need me here... It's time you told him the truth, Evelyn. Sorry, I have to go. Hey, just give me a minute. I'll get your mail. Thank you. You out here staying with the Regans for the winter? Here. Mostly junk. Thank you. Um, the paper? I almost missed you! Rick, hey there! - I hear Clem's back. - Yeah. Come bother him sometime. She fell last night. You know, I thought we were past that. Yeah, it was quite a shock. I guess we have to start locking up again. Once, we found her down here by the ponds. She only has a bruise. Nothing's broken. Are you settling in okay? Yes. The quiet has been very, very nice. The irony is, with all Clem's insisting that Mom wants to die at home, I'm pretty sure she never actually wanted to live out here. It was Dad who liked the isolation. Speaking of, looks like I need to make Clemy give him a mow. That's where he's buried? Yeah, he and my uncle. But it's actually just the marker right now. The morgue transferred him to the wrong place and he got lost. Can you believe that? That's... I mean, it's absurd, right? Come on. Hmm. Well, besides the fall, is she behaving herself? Yes. It's been lovely getting to know your mother. Okay. And with my brother? I don't see him much, so... - You probably won't. - Hmm. You should have seen the way the two of them were living before you got here. The house was disgusting. Clem and my mom have a special understanding. You can't get up, Mom. If you want to get out of bed, Evelyn has to help you. Okay? Mom, that's why she's here. Are you picking me up? Are you listening, Mom? You can't fall again. It's very dangerous. You're on Warfarin. Your blood is very thin. If you fall and cut yourself, we won't be able to stop the bleeding. Blood thinners, Mom. It could be very bad. Has she been this bad all week? Mom? Mom? Do you understand me? Mom? This is different. There she is. Can we get her up? You want your chair, Dena? No? Okay. What are y'all doing to her now? Help, then. Hush, Pepper! - Hey, sister. - She fell. She was night wandering. Oh, yeah? Shh, shh, shh, shh... Clem, where were you? Shh, shh, shh... Clem! Where were you? Mama, you can't get up. You know that. You know better. There was a boy in your room. Oh, yeah? He was colored. That's Evelyn's nephew, Mama. He's visiting. Well, th... someone is takin' my things, Clem. - They took my charivari. - Mom, are you listening? This is really important. It is important. They took my charivari. - I told him. - I cannot be driving back and forth to Houston... What's up? Just a little dizzy. You went on another run? What else am I supposed to do? You have to eat. I don't like that stuff. I'll make you something else. Mom say anything about school? They said to stay on top of your workbooks so you don't fall behind. Yeah. When that's up, the doors lock automatically, both inside and out. That's this for the front and back, and this goes to the garage, and this opens all the doors upstairs. Clem's got copies of these, and you can make copies of these. - Okay. - Keep all the doors closed. And wherever you don't want the old broad needs to be locked. Keep it locked, lock it behind you, especially at night, when the sundowning's getting bad, okay? Okay. No. I'm scared, Clem. I'm scared all the time. I wish you hadn't told me. Forget I said anything. I'm sorry, Clem. Baby, please, just... My daughter... She's right there... I see her... Tell me how you are doing that. My daughter senses you... Come on, answer me, Old Man... I'm sorry. Did you say something, Dena? Where did Clem go? I don't know. Did you need anything? I'm fine, dear. I'll just get the mail, then. How they doin'? - Excuse me? - The Regans. Oh! Oh, very well, thank you. You better tell Clem he better call some of his high school buddies. We're starting to think he's getting a little high opinion of himself. Uh, I don't think this belongs to us. Say, do you know this gentleman? I swear I've never seen another Asian around here, but he gets mail from time to time. Have a good weekend. Hey, wait! Your paper. ♪ Every little thing ♪ ♪ I beg the stars above ♪ ♪ Return me to you ♪ ♪ Everything ♪ ♪ Oh, everything ♪ ♪ Everything ♪ Ooh! Bird! No! Bird! ♪ Every... ♪ Clem! Clem. Your power out too? Is it? Well, it's not the breaker. Clemy. What's this? She's still not eating. Oh! Mama, you gotta eat. Come on, a PB and J. It's your favorite. It's the blood thinners. - Clem. - Yeah? My charivari was in my... It's not there where I used to keep it. What is that, Dena? A charivari is like a little... it's a charm bracelet or somethin'. You ain't gotta worry about that, Mama... I have a silver one. It was your father's. I know. We'll find it for you. It's bad luck without it. Mama, that's not true. I'd like to ask that young boy. Mama, I said I'll find it for you. - Leave it at that. - I'd like to talk to him. - I... I don't think... - No, let me talk to him right now. Now, son... a... a little silver... in my jewel box. Now, I know it's pretty, but I need it. I don't need the compact and I don't need seniors' things, but my charivari I need. I didn't take anything. We know you didn't. It's okay if you did, but I need it. Mama... he doesn't know where it is. - Phone keeps going out. - Sorry. Amos is who you should apologize to. He seems like a pretty good kid. He could be. He's in a tough spot right now because of his boxing. - He boxes? - He wants to. Can I move this stuff? Sure, just... just stash it somewhere. A while ago, Dena... uh, she made me take everything off the walls. Uh... will you keep an eye out for the charivari? The power's back. My child... Can you hear me? My child... It's me... I just want to come home. I know, Buster, but you can't right now. Listen... a bad thing happened to her, and there's something she needs to tell you. - Mom... - Yeah? Nothing. What? You know you'll always be my mom. How'd we do on last week's? Why, Clem? Why? This is something I don't... I don't understand why you'd do this. All those children! No, please, don't! I won't shut up anymore! I hate you. I hate you! I don't understand why you would do this. I hate you for doing this to our family. You're a sick man. No, please don't. I won't shut up anymore. I'm gonna tell everyone! No, I won't be quiet! All those children! All those children! All those children will never stay quiet! He won't stop! He won't stop! Calmer please, Mr. Sanzaru. You seem further... Where are you leaving to? Mr. Sanzaru? Whoa! Amos, hey, hey! Evy! Evy! You okay? Shit. Hey, what happened? Huh? You okay? Moe! What happened? I don't know. He... he fainted. Oh, my God, are you okay? I blacked out. Face planted. What's the matter? I've just been dizzy a bunch. There's something wrong with this place. You're pushing yourself too hard. Do you miss where you're from? I don't think about it much. I miss some things. My mom's house, it was always full of people. Where I'm from, you don't call before, you just come over. Her kitchen was always full of... it was always full of family. Are your parents still with us? No. My father left when I was young. I lost my mom last year. Should I put powder on this? Sure. Were you with your mother when she went? I couldn't leave the States, so my sister and I, we paid for a nice funeral. Dena... who are you talking to at night? What? The other night, when I came in, you were talking about a man and you were very upset. Here? I was? Oh! Oh, dear! What are you up to, Mr. Sanzaru? Do what you want with your people... But... Let mine leave first. - You have reached the voice mailbox of... - Anita Santos. To leave a voice message, press 1, or just wait for the tone. Sister, it's me again... Please call back... I can't think... Um... What does... What does Amos know? He won't look me in the eyes anymore... Clem? Patched the tire. Should last a while now. The power's out again. It's not the breaker. Try some sugar. Thanks. I was thinking about... maybe taking Amos out on the boat. I... I thought you were gonna go to town. I made you a list. We can go tomorrow. No, I would rather he finish his schoolwork. Yeah. You know... I'd check in on that if I was you. I'm gonna go see about the power. You haven't done any of these. None. So? It doesn't matter. Maybe you just want to be dumb. - Maybe you just are dumb. - Do you think anybody gives a shit if I do any of this? They don't. I can't pretend to do that. I know you're not my aunt. What's that? It's dinner. Can I help with anything? You can have a seat. You want some coffee or somethin'? Coffee would be good. - Uh, no, you don't have to do... - Don't worry about it. How's your head? Still... fuzzy. What, you don't like it? He doesn't like fish. I do. Hmm. I suppose you like it better with all the chemicals they put in it from the supermarket. Yeah, they want you to get used to the taste of chemicals, so you forget what real meat tastes like. - That's not true. - That's a true story. - Hmm-mm. - Did you know they pump supermarket meats full of carbon monoxide? It's true. Keeps it all red. Real meats turn brown, you let 'em sit out for too long. Oh, my God. Dena, what are you doing? Holy shit, Mama! Dena, can you hear me? - We have to sit you down. - I can hear him. We're right here, Dena. Let's sit you down. I can hear him. Where's that coming from? Shit! Moe, get my kit by the bed. Now! I'm right here, Dena. It's the blood thinners. We have to clot the bleeding now. I can still hear him in the walls, Clemy. - Mama, you gotta relax. - Go check the top left drawer. Hold this. Top, top left. I don't want this anymore. She make you afraid of dyin'? But I have a faith that guides me. What about you? Waitin' for her to die has been somethin' horrific. But, nah, I ain't afraid of anything anymore. Anymore? I hope it's okay to ask about your father. When did he pass away? I'm sorry to ask. I feel like I should know. Dena doesn't say anything. Maybe she doesn't want to. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. Come in. Here, have a seat... if you like. You know, I just got back from Afghanistan. I... I didn't know. There was this kid there with us, didn't quite fit in. Had narcolepsy. Maybe he's a little off, you know. - He would fall asleep? - Yeah. Yeah. So, you ever met a narcoleptic dog before? No. Is it a joke? No. I had this dog when I was a kid. She was narcoleptic. She'd fall asleep all the time. You throw a ball for her, and she'd be runnin' hard after it, tail waggin', all happy... then she'd just fall over sideways, snorin'. Our unit didn't treat him too good. That kid I was tellin' you about. Oh, right. What happened? One night, things got out of hand. He got beat up pretty bad. Few of the others, they... took advantage. Officer asked me what happened. I... I didn't say a thing. Not one word. And the kid, he was... too ashamed. He killed himself? No. He was back on patrol pretty quick after that. I was on point, checkin' for IEDs, you know, roadside bombs. He was maybe, you know, here... here to the house. Stepped on one. I woke up in some hospital a month later in Germany. I'm sorry. But one thing didn't lead to the other. You going to do this? Should I? What about Dena? My sister'll take care of her. I could make some good money. Yeah, looks like it. Enough to eventually support some other people, I bet. I was thinkin' about gettin' my own place soon. Maybe. Somethin' I've been thinkin' about recently. The shrapnel entered my groin and my left thigh in 24 different places. I don't know what you're lookin' for, what you want, but... I won't be able to... Listen... Listen... Can you hear me? Evy? Grandson... Listen... Grandson... Listen... Amos? Amos! Amos! Moe! Grandson! Grandson! Let him be, cocksucker! Moe! Moe, sweetie. Call 911. There's... there's no tone. His pulse is fine. Help me. - Phones are down. - Help me, help me. He'll wake up in a second. Moe? Moe? I'm sorry, we have to leave. Um, I... I'm going to pack. We... can you get his stuff? No. No. The hospital's too far away. And with the phone line down... Let me... I'll drive to the post office, call the doctor. He'll be here in ten minutes. Ten minutes. I think I'm cracking up. ♪ Everything ♪ ♪ Oh, everything ♪ Mom! ♪ Everything ♪ Hello, Dr. Sillick's residence. Hello? Hello? Amos? What? Hello? Clem? Grandson... It's the Old Man... He came back through... He was their father... He is Mr. Sanzaru... He's trying to keep you here too... I'm going to get you out of here. Evelyn? Evelyn! We need you. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. The room in the garage, who does it belong to? It was my dad's. Did he... did he tape you or your sister? I'm not sure. Sometimes I know he did. I'm certain of it. I have these dreams, you know. But when I wake up... I'm not so sure. I shouldn't have hidden his key. I was scared. That's not a secret anyone should keep. I had this plan... I wasn't ever gonna come back here. But then you showed up. Amos and I have to go now. You don't have to go. Well, I'm sorry, we need you to stay. Wai... Hey! Clem! Hey! Clem! I was so ashamed when they said you were going to be born. Everyone said you were better off in America with Anita. Maybe they were right. I was afraid I couldn't take care of you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My daughter... Hear me... The door is open... Moe? Are you okay? - I think so. - Okay. I need you to go to the post office and wait for me there. Okay. Can you make it? - I think so. - Okay. Okay, go. Go. My daughter... Why won't you hear me? Mom? Why won't you listen? Dena, get up. Dena? We have to get up. - I have to get you... I can't carry you. - Oh, Clem. No, no. We'll come back for him. Oh... Oh, Clem.
