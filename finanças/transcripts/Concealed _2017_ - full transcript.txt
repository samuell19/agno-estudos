- Oi. I'll be back in a month. The usual thing, feed the fish. Lots of love, Jodi. - Not too shabby, huh? - Okay, bye. - Reckon she'll like these? - Yeah, look how cute they are. - I still can't believe it. - Do we have to have this discussion again? - I know, I know, I've said it before. - Change-of-life baby. Some woman have children into their 50s. - Yeah. I'm just bloody glad it wasn't us. - Yeah, you've said that before too. Hey, what's this? - Don't know. Maybe the giraffe and hippo are breeding. - My wallet's not in here. Did I give it to you? - No. - Sure? Can you go and get the ticket to the airline? - Yeah, sure. - In that little thing... - Yeah, I know. Drop the gun, dead beat, or I'll blow your testicles to kingdom come. Who says dead beat? Sounds shit. - I don't suppose you've had another look for my wallet? - Oh. No, I'm just learning my lines, babe. - Don't worry about it. Hello? Yeah. Yep. Ah, that's awesome. Bye. - Who was it? - Hello? - Sis, it's me. Are you alone? - Yeah, what's wrong? - Sorry for disturbing you. Jodi left a second set of keys. - Oh, thanks for that. - That's cute. - Oh, did you hear that? She thinks you're cute. Think you'd better have him. - Aww. Sure? What do you say? - Thank you. - Catch you later. Sallie? Sallie? Hey, Bill. You haven't seen Sallie around, have ya? - No, is everything all right? - Yeah, she's probably just gone for a wander. It's a little bit strange but I'm sure it'll be okay, Irene. - Well, you've got me worried now. - Well, don't be. Honestly, I'm sure she'll wander in any second. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. Bye-bye. Look, the reason I'm calling is I'm just wondering, have you seen Sallie at all or have you spoken to her? - No, I haven't. - Hmm. - Is something wrong? - Oh no, it's just, she's just not about. Well, if she shows up can you give us a call? Uh-huh. Thank you, Jacky. If someone is admitted under that name can you please get them to call me immediately? Have you heard from her? - No. Have you? Called the police? - Yeah. - It'll be fine. - Yeah. - Look, is there something I can do? I could, I could stay with you. - Look, the police are on their way. They'll probably be here any minute. - Has she disappeared before? - No. - Was she on medication? - No. Isn't the first 48 hours, they're really crucial, yeah? - They are, Mr. Raven, but there are some questions we need to ask, okay? - Of course. - The two of you getting along okay? Any relationship troubles? - No. - Did she or you have any money problems? - No. - Did she take her passport or credit cards with her? - Actually, her passport's here but her wallet was stolen. - Stolen? - Yeah. Somewhere between the airport and here. - Any reason that you can think of for her to leave so suddenly? - No. - Anything at all you'd like to add? - Yeah, it's strange. I think we were followed. - Where? - In the park, on the way back from the airport. - Did you get a look at the person? - No, I didn't see him at all. - Was there anyone that might have had a grudge against you or your girlfriend? - We've been away six years. No. - The end of the world party? - Yeah, it's like, even if we invite everyone at once, we just invite everyone. Maybe, like-- - Uh, sorry. Mitch, get rid of the cigarette, mate. And stick it where the sun don't shine. You boys have a good holiday, stay out of trouble. Look, I'll see you guys next term. And remember astrology assignment's due first week back. What's a constellation and who named them. - Yes, sir, we know. - Yes, sir, we know. - What's the ecliptic? Did you have a fight? You said someone followed you? - Yeah, I think so. - Any idea why? Is there anything else you can think of that might help? - No. - Surely there has to be something out of the ordinary. - I don't have it. - She swapped it. - Who did you swap it with? - Susie Faletti. - These gentlemen need to find the elephant. There's not a school friend of yours that would know her address? - Okay, I'll try. - Good girl. I'll text you the address. You look like you could do with a rest. - What are we looking for? - Anything. Oi! Fagan. What's that say? - The Signatures Club. Fagan. You know him? - No. - Yo. You boys looking to play? - Yeah. Mate, we're actually looking for Fagan, is he about? - All right, I'll tell you what. Take a seat. It's $20 bucks to play, $35 if you win your match we take five for the house. - Check. - You boys looking to find Fagan? - Yeah, is he around? - Nah, Fagan ain't been around here for ages. - Can you help us out? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you boys at that door after your game, huh. - I'll take your horse thingy, and the black square. - Check. - You're gone, mate. He just moved your queen-- - Hey, we're here to find Fagan, remember? - Mate. - Have you seen her? - No, no, what are, what are you playing at, man? You fucking with us? No, I haven't seen her. I can't help. I fucking can't help, all right? Oh fuck! Wait, wait, wait. You boys had a deal with Fagan, yeah? I know what you're after, yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay, you better not be cops. - Mate, we're not cops. - Okay cool, just wait one minute. Yeah. Woo! There you go, boys. $1,200, yeah? Includes ammo. You won't do better, let's go. You got the cash, huh? - Um. No, I think we'll find Fagan, mate. - Hey, hey, mate, Fagan ain't doing guns no more. She's going straight. Yeah, let's go, okay. Are we on or what? Huh? Okay, okay, now what's up, boys? Let's go. Um, a grand, that's it. - Look mate, I think, really, I think we'll pass, okay? - You'll pass? Mate, mate this thing will smash anything within 100 meters. What's the problem, huh? - No, we just need to think about this, all right? - You need to think about it? What's your game, man? Are you undercovers? Just look at this guy, man. - Hey, we're not. Relax. - Relax? How about I just take it-- - Hey. - Keep your gun, maybe that's a fair deal. - Of course I want it, I want it, yeah. Mate, you've got to understand. Chill, please. Please? - Chill it, huh? - Okay, I came here to find Fagan, do you understand? So you've got to throw in Fagan's address. $750 is all I got, though. Deal? - Get rid of it. Mate, hey. - Yeah, okay. Keep a look out, will you? - I can't believe we bought a gun. - I know. But if I hadn't, he might have put a bullet in us. Plus I got the address. Did you see how wired he was, man? - Yes, it was a very uncomfortable situation. - Hello! Can you keep a look out? - For what? - I'm about to break in. - Mate, no. - Just keep a look out. Just hang back, all right? Hello? Is anybody here? - Hurry up. - Hang back. - Sallie's? Hey, hide. Hide! - Don't fuckin' move. Get down. Stay there. Where is it? Where is the address? - On the table. - Jodi, 88 Shephard Street, this is it? This is the address? - Yeah, yeah. - Did you have to do that? - Let's just get out of here. - Okay, okay, I'll call the cops. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's just take a minute to think about this. - Mate, I'm leaving right now, come on. - Just wait. - Mate, we've got to go. Come on! - Fagan? - Oh, shit! Oh, shit! What the fuck? - Fagan? - Down, get down! Get down! - Hey, hey! Get down, down, down, down. - Don't kill me, don't kill me, please, please! Take whatever you want, keep the elephant. - I don't want the elephant. I want my girlfriend. - I don't know where she is. - What are you doing here? - Why did you kill Fagan? - We didn't. What are you going to do, fry him to death? Right, now you're going to tell us what's going on. - I'm not telling you shit. - Uh-huh. - Come on boys, come on. What are you going to do? Don't kill me, please. - You're going to tell me where the fuck Sallie is. - You either tell us or tell the police, mate. Because that's where we're going now. - No, I don't think so. Because I'm sure they'd love to hear how we met. As I remember it, you were standing over Fagan Smallman's dead body with a gun in your hand. I reckon that'll interest them more than your missing girlfriend's purse. Oh yeah, and if I remember correctly I saw you put a bullet in her. No, no, no! I'll talk to the cops! Please, let me out! - Do you think he's okay in there? - Let me out of here! - Max Raven recalls Sallie on the phone before she disappeared. - Yeah, we talked about catching up. Her seeing Mum and Dad, nothing that would be of any help. - You realize you were the last person to talk to her before she went missing? - No, I hadn't. - Did she mention who she talked to on the other call? - No. - You're positive? - Yeah. - Was there a reason you called her? - She's my sister. She'd just got in, I wanted to say hi. I haven't seen her for six years. - What are we doing here? - Ah, audition. Audition. - Great. Where do we go next, drop him off at yoga? You can let go of me. I'm not going anywhere. - Sure. - Listen, I don't have a choice. I just want to get the elephant, get my money, and get out of here. You help me do that, it's all good. - Hey, and what about Sallie, huh? - What about Fagan? - So where are we driving to? - His place. - What? Why? There's nothing there. Oh, shit! - Shit. What do we do? - I've got the address. G'day, mate. - What do you want? - I don't know how to tell you this but, um, I believe your daughter Susie has an elephant which belongs to me, and I really need it back. - She traded that at school. - Look, I really have to have it back. - Sorry mate, there's no way I'm going to break my little angel's heart. - What about for a-- - Susie? - At least I've never made a little kid cry. - You're a drug runner, right? - Fuck you, arsehole. - You're the arsehole. - Hey, oh, Max. - Hey! You tell me right now. Why did Fagan have Sallie's purse, why? - Okay, okay! - Why? - Let go, let go. I would have told you anyway, like I fucking care. - Good. - It was the first time I'd ever smuggled anything. I didn't know what it was. I didn't want to know. When we landed in Sydney, everything went wrong. I started feeling real sick. I didn't know if it was me freaking out, or the bloody airplane food. I just didn't think I could hold it together enough to get through customs, you know. So I gave the purse to Fagan so she could get the elephant. I just couldn't do it. - Pull over. - Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Just leave it. Don't open them. - Hey, hey. - Chill. - Are you bloody serious? - All right, they're mine, they're mine! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey! You can have them when I get Sallie back. - Mate, I have to hand them over. I'm not fucking around, I need them! - You can have them back when we get Sallie. I don't want the diamonds, you understand? - I don't think you understand. - Do you know much about diamonds? - No, that's why I'm here. - This is a rough diamond, and, you don't have a Kimberly Process Certificate? - Mate, I'm just after some help. If you can't point me in the right direction, that's, that's cool. - No, no, that's fine. Just hang on a second. No, he doesn't know a thing about diamonds. - Look, I really feel it's time we got the police involved. We got the diamonds. Why not just give them to the cops? - No, hold on to these. Keep them well hidden, okay? Oi, oi. You even think about stealing those diamonds, I'll make it my life's mission to find you and kill you. You understand? - Yeah, whatever. - Max, I don't feel good about this. What's the plan, mate? - Well, if anything comes up will you let us know? - Yeah. - No matter how small. - Sorry, Max, the front door was open. - That's okay, mate. - Any clues to what happened? - Yeah, look, I, um, I'm not coping so well with Sallie's disappearance. I got a bit upset. - Do you mind if we-- - No, of course. - You ever heard of a woman called Fagan Smallman? - Doesn't ring any bells. - She was found dead recently in her apartment. - Right, is that related to Sallie's disappearance? - She was a member of a local chess club. - Yeah, how does that concern me? - Apparently you made a visit to this chess club. - So I had a game of chess. - Have you ever heard of conflict diamonds? - Yeah, sure. - There have been a lot of deaths over them. Civil wars, Mr. Raven. - That's not something I want to get involved in. - Yeah, well I reckon you are involved. I think you're out there playing detective. - Mate, I've just come back to this country for a couple auditions. - Do you think we're idiots? - Of course I'm looking for Sallie! - Just calm down. - Do you understand, is that okay? - Is there anything you want to tell us? - No. - That's it, then. - I hope you know what you're doing, Mr. Raven. - It's okay, mate. - I'm gonna have to go. - The food's almost ready. - Yeah I know. Look, it's to do with Sallie I can't really talk about it. - No? It's okay. - So, after, after D5 there's a knight exchange and then black will have to retreat, say, to E7. And as the white tries to exploit the, the pole weakness on the queen's side black will counter play on the king's side. Too fast? - Yeah, just a little mate, just a little. - Sorry, I'm not good at this. I'm not good at this teaching. - Well, you're passionate about it. That's all you need really, to be a teacher. A good teacher. - You teach? - Ahh, yep, yep, science. 11 years. - 11 years? - Yeah. - That would do my head in. - Actually, it is good to have a bit of time off. - You call this a holiday? - You ever tried to explain the laws of the universe to kids with behavioral problems? - Good at science and such a shitty chess player, how does that work? - On the ground! On the ground, both of you. On the ground and don't fuckin' move. Check the house, mate. Now stay down and shut up! - Hey! Now drop the gun. - Don't be stupid, mate. - I've got the diamonds. - Then just hand them over and let's end this now. - You think I'd keep them here? - What do you want? - I want my girlfriend. You bring her and I'll give you your fucking diamonds. - Where? - Hawthorne Canal, under the West Link. Two hours. - The diamonds. - Where's Sallie? - Where are the stones? I'm not fucking around here. - I just want to see Sallie's okay. - The diamonds are all that concerns me. - Okay, you've got your diamonds, where's Sallie? - Hey, hey, where's my money? I never got paid. - Where's Sallie? - Wait! - I just want-- - Wait a minute! - Have you got her or what? Hey! - Fuck! - I can't believe you didn't use it. At least when they were in the car driving off you could've blown out a window or something. - Hey, hey mate, this is all new to us, okay? We don't normally go around blowing out windows. - He's right, I should have used it. - Ah, I'm so fucked. You boys have completely fucked this up. They have the diamonds, your girlfriend, and my money. And what do we have? Nothing. - Shut up! - I'm not scared of you. Especially after how you just handled that. I mean, if Sallie's found dead you can blame yourself after that balls-up. - Hey, hey, hey, leave him Max, leave him. - You're an idiot. - Leave him! Hey, we don't need this! - You thought you could handle these blokes? What are you, James fucking Bond? You're a bloody actor, probably a lousy one. There are people I owe money to, impatient people. You gonna protect me from them? Damn right. I should be busting your ass for fucking this up. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Jesus! - I'm a dead man! - Fucking stay there. - What, that's it, not a word? - What do you want us to say, Perry? Eh, eh? - You want us to ask why or how you're a dead man? Because I can tell you at this moment, I don't care, mate. - Well, fuck you too. And your mate. - Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? - Let him go. - Perry! Where you going? We're behaving like people I don't know and I don't want to know. Guns, mate. Kidnap. Murder. Conflict diamonds, drug smuggling. You know the most exciting thing that happened to me before this was getting my wisdom teeth out. Mate, can we just stop and have a real hard think about what we're doing here? - I'm sorry, man. I need a place to stay. What? - I can't. - Why not? - I just can't, Max. - Hey. Any news? - Not really. - I'm worried, Max. - I'm gonna find her. If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna find her. - Yeah, I know. - Okay. Listen, I need to ask you something. - Okay, what? - I need a place to stay. Hello? - Hey, look. I'm worried about Perry. I think he's gonna get killed, mate. - What's that got to do with us? - Max, I don't want blood on our hands, okay? I'm calling the police now. If there's anything you need to do, right, to protect yourself-- - You can't call the police, okay? We put a bullet. - What, Fagan? Mate, she was already dead. - Cops don't know that. It ain't gonna make any difference to them. - What if Perry is telling the truth, okay? Then these guys are gonna kill him. - Perry? You in there, Perry? - Hey, Perry! Oi! - You can wait here a minute. - Oh. - Jesus! I'll get the cops. - Oh, shit! Sh-- - Hey, don't touch anything. - We're not action heroes, mate. School teacher, actor, mate. That's it. - Fuck, let's go. - The police haven't told us much. - No, me neither. - Well, it's nice to see you after such a long time. Manners, look, this is Max. - Hi, Max. - Hello, you must be Violet. Sallie's told me a lot about you. - So you can't sleep, huh? Would you like me to read you a story? Okay, say goodnight. - Goodnight. - 'Night. Look, Joe, I, uh, I want you to know I'm doing everything I can to find your daughter. - Oh, thanks, Max. But I think we'll leave it all to the police. - Oh, hi, Sallie. It's Bill here, Jodie's neighbor. Umm, I've just got a me-- - Hi, Sal, it's Jacky. Um, I really need to speak to you so I'll try-- - Hi, Sal, it's Victoria. You guys have probably landed. I can't wait to see you. Hope you had a good trip. Give me a call, lots of love. - She told you everything, yeah? Was she involved in anything? Anything I didn't know about? - What do you mean? - You just start to wonder whether you really knew somebody. - Of course you did. - What about the last phone call? Was there anything that she said out of the ordinary? Anything stuck in your mind? - Well, she was still upset. - Yeah. - It must have been hard on both of you. She wanted to keep the baby, Max. I mean, she knew you didn't, she understood that, but, it was really tough for her. And she said she wishes she hadn't chosen a name. Anais? - Yeah. - You, you okay? - Yep. - Can I get you another? - Yeah, maybe one more. - Hey, Max. I have to talk to you. We need to meet up. - How long is it since you've spoken to them? - It's been a while. - Even your little sister? - Yeah. You know, I never thought that you and Sallie would stay together. - Well, we did. Come on, I went all the way to South Africa to be with her. - Maybe she's left you for someone else? - No. I love your sister. - It's a possibility, Max. - No, it's not. - It is. - Yeah, well look I don't want to hear it anymore. I won't listen anymore. - It's just a possibility. - Later. - Where are they? Where are they? - What? - We're only talking about diamonds. - Where's Sallie? - Sallie? Who the fuck's Sallie? - Violet? Violet? Violet? Violet? Oh, my god. - Look, I don't have them. if had 'em, I would give them to you. All I want is Sallie, that's it. Nothing else. - What about that mate of his? The one who had the diamonds under the bridge. - Hey, he wouldn't take them, all right? - Yeah, hey, what's his address? What's his address? - All right, he's got a fuckin' family, all right, he'd never do it. - Ahh, he got a family. And you want your girl back. You want your girl back? - Yeah. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Okay, now who has the fuckin' diamonds? Huh? Come on. I'm going to start putting a hole into this fucker until someone's dead. - Not peeping? Ready, and pop! Open. Do you love that? - Yeah. - Okay, you can have that. What are you gonna call her? - Isabella. - Isabella, lovely. Now, look at this. Do you think that's pretty? - Yeah. - It's this way. - Fuckin' better be. - Jacky, where are they? - What? - Where are they? - I don't know what you're on about. - I stuck a bag of diamonds in your toilet. With packets of diamonds in 'em. Now one of the packets is missing. I ain't fucking around, where are they? Where are they? - I sold them. - What? Sold them? - Yeah, I did. - You sold them? - Well, it's your fucking fault for hiding them in my toilet. - My fucking fault? - I've got this shitty crappy life and I come across them. What the fuck did you expect me to do with them? - You're insane. You're insane! - What are you involved in? What? Fuck that, right? Where's the money, have you got the money? - I spent it. - You spent it? - Yeah on my shitty, crappy life. - On your shitty, crappy life. - To make it a bit better. - Great. That's fucking great. - What were you doing hiding diamonds here? - My place isn't safe. - Well, I sold them. - Great. Well, we need to get 'em back. Where are they? - Pawn shop. - Pawn shop, right. Get your things together. We're going there now. - I was just getting my life back on track. And then you started to came back and started to fuck it up again. - Sallie and Richard's life are in danger right now, all right? So you're gonna get your shit together and we're leaving now. Now! - Max, please, stop. I can't, I can't do it. He's not gonna give them back. What do you mean he's not going to give them back? I'm going to put a gun to his face. - Oh, fuck! This is... I'm just gonna go, okay? Please. - Look, they're conflict diamonds. He has bought conflict diamonds. He's not gonna call the cops. - I can't, Max, okay? Please. - Don't worry about Richard, don't worry about your sister. Give me your car keys. Good on ya. - Sweetie. It's okay, darling. It's okay, darling. Oh, shhh! Shhh, it's okay. Are you all right, darling? Ohh. Shhh. - Yes, Jacky. - Don't you fucking move. - Max. - Richard about? - Um, yeah, you might find him down there. - No, he's not in the car. Is he not home? - He hasn't set foot inside this house for over three months, Max. - Really? - There's a lot of things Richard hasn't told you. - Mummy? - Is Felix okay? - He's fine. - Okay, um. Do you mind if I hang about and wait for him? - Sure. - Thank you. - And when you see him, tell him to move his bloody car. It's embarrassing. - I want Sallie and Richard. I'm not fucking around! - Neither are we! - The diamonds, mate. - Hey! Richard, Sallie, no tricks. I want my girlfriend. - I told you so many fucking times! We do not have her. - Police! Police, don't move! - Gun shots being fired. Suspects heading north on Sutton Ave. - What do you want, mate? - Look, I'm really sorry I left you, mate. - Take some time. - Are you okay? - I'll survive. - You and Monica? - Divorced. - You didn't want to tell me? - You didn't ask. - And what, you don't have anywhere else to live? - No, not really. At least I get to see Felix this way, eh? - You really are fucked up, aren't you? - What? - I'm leaving. - Yeah right, mate, okay. Hey! - I'm leaving. - What the fuck's wrong with your head? - I don't know. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I should be pissed at you. You put my life in danger. - I know man, I'm fucked! Sallie knew it, everyone fucking knows it. - Don't, don't do the Poor Max routine. - I'm not, mate, I'm not. - Giving me shit, mate. - I'm not. I'm just telling you to get out of my life, man. - You know, mate, I realize what you're really good at. Weak as piss, mate, weak as piss. - Is this yours? - Yeah. A friend gave it to me. - This friend of yours, is he in the photo? - That bloke. - Good friends, are you? - More acquaintances. Oi. - What'd you do to Fagan, man? - Sorry? - Is there something you want? - Look, I've lost his details and I desperately need to get in touch with him. Can you help me? - Well, why don't you give me yours and if I see him I'll let him know. - Look, I gave you an address and a gun and next thing I know she got her brains blown out. Don't take a super sleuth to see a connection now, huh? - You know, I really wanted to surprise him. - He really doesn't like surprises. - I didn't kill her. - Look, what do you want from us, man? Why are you pressin' us? - The blokes who did kill Fagan, I need to find 'em. - Are you gonna give me your details? Because if you're not, there's nothing more I can do for you. - I thought I told you to piss off. - Well, my hearing's going, I reckon. - You want me to say it out louder? - Mate, I've known you since I was seven. You reckon you're going to get rid of me that easily, eh? - Ricky... Go back to Monica. - She doesn't want me. - Neither do I. - I'm sorry I've been such a shit to you. You okay? - I don't know what to do. - It'll be okay. - Just go, okay? I don't want you here, I don't want you in my life. Okay. If anything happens to you, not my fault. Hey! - So that's how it's going to be, is it? - Just need to know if you have my woman. - What's with this chick? You're a dumb fuck. I don't have your bitch. - Calm down, calm down! Hey Max-- - Stay there. You stay there. - You don't know what you're doing. You're fuckin' in over your head. So why don't you leave it and piss off before you get yourself killed? - Don't come any closer. You tell me what's happened to Sallie. - You're weak as piss. Give us the fucking gun, eh? - No! Fuck you! - We gotta go. This is bad, mate, really bad. All right, I'll get the car, you stay here. Just help me. - I don't know if this is a good idea. - Are you kidding, mate? You were holding him when he was shot. Do you know how easy it is to link him to us? Not fucking around mate, let's go! - I don't think anyone saw us. - Mate, have you fucking watched TV? Shit, they're gonna trace to us like fucking CSI. - Let's just get this fucking body out of the boot. - Yeah. - Oh! I think you're gonna win. Your go. - I want number six. - Number six. Yes! One, two, three, you can jump four. - I wanna see Mummy. - Aren't we having fun? - But I still miss Mummy. - Violet, listen to me, darling. Please sweetie, sweetheart, stop. I need you to listen. Mummy's not your real mummy. I am. Do you understand, sweetie? I know it's confusing, darling. Hey? - I wanna go home. - Don't you want to spend some more time with me? - You won't go on your own because you know I'm right. - She gave her to me. - You took her away. - She couldn't have looked after her. - She just wants to start caring for her child. - Well, she didn't care at the time. - She didn't know what she wanted. We need to pull together. - This family has never been together. - You know I'm leaving? - Yeah. - I can't stay. - Jacky, what's happening? You're using again, huh? - No. Just a few times. It's been fucking tough, okay? - Yeah. It's been tough. - Max, we could be together. - I'm going, Jacky. - Wait. Max, please. Look, please. - I made my decision back then, okay? - I'm leaving tomorrow with Violet. - Is Violet your daughter? - No. She's ours. - Hello? - I'm keeping her. - I'll call the police. - Do it. She's my child. - She's mine legally. - You took advantage of me. - Advantage? You gave birth to her on the bathroom floor. We've all lived through your drugs. I'm not allowing Violet to go through it too. - I have been clean for a year. I've got a job and a unit. I'm ready to look after her. - Have you told her anything? - I will. - Sallie is missing. Why are you doing this now? - Darling, stay away from that. Sweetie, get away. - Is she okay? Let me speak to her. - She's fine. I need your signature to get Violet a visa. - What? Never, I'll never sign it. - You will, or you'll never see her again. - Jacky, please. Please just bring her home. - I just, I just want my daughter. - Well, I'm not letting you take her. - Sweetie, get away. - Hello. Whoa! What's going on? Darling, are you okay? Can you wait outside? Are you okay? - Yeah. - Just wait there, okay? Jacky? Jacky? Jacky? Jacky. Ohh. Oh, shit. - Max. Max! We need to talk. - We think we may have found Sallie. - A body washed up at Bondi. We think it's her. - I didn't do enough. - We did everything we could, mate. - I could've done more. - There was nothing else we could have done, Max. - I just, I'm gonna... I just really, really wanna hurt him. - I'm leaving now. - What, where? - Just help me. - Jacky, I'm kinda busy right now. - You have my car and you are bringing it here now to get me and your daughter. - Jacky? Jacky, we know you're in there! Jacky! Violet! - Mummy! - Darling, please! - Mummy! - Just go. - Here we go. - I've been followed. - Move. - Hey, it's all right. Listen, are you okay? - Yes. - Yeah? - Yes, yes. - Let's get the fuck out of this. - Yes, yes. - Let's go. - Don't try and stop me. - Jacky, what about Violet? Does the name Anais mean anything to you? - I really want you out of my life, Max. - Did you know Sallie had an abortion? Jacky, did Sallie know Violet was ours? Did you tell her? Did you, Jacky? - It's me. Are you alone? - Yeah, what's wrong? - Come on, I need to know! - You know what? I think I'm gonna take you home to Irene. - Can't we stay a little longer please? - That's a good idea actually. We'll just stay a little bit longer.
