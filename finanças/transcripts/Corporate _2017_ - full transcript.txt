Adjust it, then put his paw through the hole. Emilie Tesson-Hansen, a word before we go? Emilie, I'm counting on you. She's our top dog, our lead HR Manager. Don't blow it. - To sharpen your competitive skills. - Look at that! - Don't film me, film the departure! - Ok, Stéphane. Feet on the brake. Don't release. As soon as we go, slowly release the brake. Xavier, first impressions? I'm a kid again. - Emilie, how was it? - Crazy! The thing that really surprised me is... you need to trust. Trust yourself at the reins. You're 46 years old. This is a key point in your career. How do you see yourself in 10 years? 10 years? 2 years, 6 months? I don't know. It's not a trick question. I ask myself too. So how do you see yourself? Catherine, our world is ever-changing. Don't submit to change. Anticipate it. How do you imagine your future? I'd like to keep working with the team, giving it my all and work on making the improvements we discussed. Here at Esen, there's room to grow. So many possibilities. What do you mean? Do you think I should change positions? I don't want to think for you. But we can brainstorm together. Are you asking me to go mobile? I can help you consider the possibility. I understand it's urgent, but she's not available today. I'm sorry, it won't be easy to see her this week. Listen, Mr. Dalmat... I'll ask her and get back to you, ok? Great. Thanks. Catherine Tremblay's going mobile. Send her the form. When can you see Dalmat? No time this month. Keep him waiting. He didn't understand your email. Resist the pressure. Morning, everyone. I trust you had a good weekend. Everybody well? What's on the agenda? Anyone? I'd like to discuss the behavioral evaluations... Not evaluations again! Thibault, evaluations are merely a tool... 12:30, La Gioconda? ...depends how you use them. We got feedback... Feedback time is over. We're using them now. Sorry, but I need to see Ms. Tesson today. Mr. Dalmat... I know it's important, but today is impossible. Make it possible. I must see her. She's not here. Sophie says you imagine your coworkers naked. No, I imagine them making love. Great, thanks. I'm loving this conversation. Sorry to disappoint you, but I've never been with Stéphane. What kind of teacher was he? Sexy. He slept with all his students. I was his favorite. Seriously. He was inspiring. You must've been too, for him to hire you 10 years later. We never really lost touch. He followed my career in London, waiting for an opportunity. You dropped everything to join him? I dropped my job, not my man. So your man dropped his job too? Are you ok? Sorry. I shouldn't drink wine at lunch. Listen, I'm... I'm going to take a walk. Don't want to be seen together? Right. What's your problem, Mr. Dalmat? Stop following me! Have you gone mad? You sent me the same email as last time. You could've changed the wording. I'm not right? What am I right for? Calm down. We'll make an appointment. You refuse to see me! You've got it in for me! Why? Let go of me. Let go of me! You don't understand? We want to get rid of you. You won't be offered another position. So quit. Quit! For fuck's sake! - What happened? - The courtyard... What's going on? I just heard the noise... Come. Where's Sophie? I don't know. Come. - Where's Stéphane? - On his way. We're all in shock. It's a terrible tragedy. Patricia will explain the procedure to follow. First, we appoint a crisis committee. Then, we have to tell our colleagues, his family and the media, set up a support network, and deal with the paperwork. Are you ok? Did you see him? I was in my office. You're in the hot seat, but you'll be fine. You're the best. I trust you completely. Thank you, Stéphane. What did the police say? They questioned everyone. They have 4 witnesses who saw Dalmat jump. It was suicide. Is this our first suicide? On site, yes. Health and Safety will be all over it. That's your problem, you head the committee. Read me the release again. "A tragic event has occurred at Esen's head office. Management and employees are profoundly saddened. Our hearts go out to the family..." - Was the family notified? - The nurse is handling that. "Grief counselors are available. The tragedy is of a personal nature and appears not to be linked to the work environment." That won't fly. Sounds like we're covering ourselves, or in denial. It's standard wording. They're always the same. It's ridiculous. - "Why'd you kill yourself?" - "It's personal." We could put "of a private nature." Who's speaking? Emilie Tesson, Dalmat's supervisor. She's helming the crisis committee. What exactly do you mean? Dalmat and his wife recently separated. He moved out 3 months ago. Are you sure? Yes, he changed his address. Some say he was depressed. Problem solved. I spoke to his wife. The police informed her. I told her I'm here to help, she can call me anytime. We'll need to arrange to meet with her. Where's Sophie? Her boyfriend came for her. She was really shaken. I'll call her tonight. I met Didier Dalmat in January 2015 when I became human resources manager... Mr. Dalmat was an outstanding management accountant... However, recently... Mr. Paynot isn't here? Mr. Maury either? Catherine, come. Let's go see the nurse. What for? Does my crying bother you? Is it preventing the others from working? It's not proactive, I suppose? No one's working anyway. We all need to talk, express what we're feeling. What are you feeling, Ms. Tesson? Did you see Didier yesterday? Did he speak to you, as he spoke to me? What did he say to you? He asked how my son is doing. He hadn't spoken to me in months, and he asked about my son. I could've asked him to lunch like I used to. I don't know why I didn't. You mustn't torture yourself. I mustn't torture myself? Am I the only one who feels bad here? We are committed to exposing all the causes that led this long-term Esen employee to commit his desperate act. Health and Safety should thus investigate the Ambition 2016 Plan, which we feel has had a disastrous effect on the mental health of Esen's employees. We all feel as badly as Mr. Petit does. But out of respect for the family, we caution against any attempt to exploit the situation. Mr. Dalmat's act was an isolated incident. There doesn't appear to be any link between his suicide and Ambition 2016. Didier Dalmat killed himself at work. That's a clear message. No. He didn't leave a note. Everything points to problems in his private life. Don't start doing that dance! Didier Dalmat died at his workplace. You're legally obliged to declare a work accident. And we will. We hope so. You all know the Plan puts people first. Well-being is our... - Spare us the marketing crap! - Not here. Not after what happened. Ms. Tesson-Hansen was Dalmat's supervisor. She can give us the best insight into him. I met Didier Dalmat in January 2015, when I became human resources manager for Financial Services. Mr. Dalmat was an outstanding management accountant. He was an important and valued member of the department. But recently, according to colleagues, his behavior had changed. He was developing a negative attitude... Excuse me, are you on the Health and Safety Committee? This is a special meeting, and what Ms. Tesson has to say is important. You have no business here. Don't be ridiculous, Inspector. Please leave. Thank you. Let's hear from the occupational physician. Hi, Sophie. How are you? I threw up all night. But I feel better now. Xavier Paynot's in there. It's not your fault. I know how hard it was with Dalmat. I know it's not my fault. I won't tolerate any blame. Whatever it takes, get me the fuck out of this department. No need to be crude. Excuse me? Ok. I'll see what I can do. That's not good enough. I want out of here right now. Get me transferred. I want to go to Asia. You can go home, Sophie. They asked me to pick out the funeral wreath. I have no idea what to have them write on it. Let Communications handle it. We can't do everything. Got anything to drink? Japanese whiskey. - From Vincent? - Yeah. We did our job, Sophie. It's not our fault. Especially not yours. No one knows he was trying to see me. I know. You're free to mention it, or not. Understand? What exactly are you asking of me? Nothing. He couldn't stomach Etienne Bottom's up old friend He was a dear buddy of mine He never gave me the... He wasn't one to be tongue-tied Or to pretend his hands were tied He never gave me the cold shoulder He was a good buddy of mine By Robert Desnos. - Hi, buddy. - Hi, Mom. Who wants to try Esen's new yogurt? It's for men. Makes them strong. Raspberry's for girls. Then what's for boys? - Cucumber. - Chocolate! You're looking handsome. I've got an interview. Shall I warm you up? What are your strengths, Mr. Hansen? I don't want to play this with you. Good morning. What are you doing? Talking with the department manager. You should have told me. I have full access here. Will you come with me, or are you two still talking? I'll come with you. Goodbye, sir. Thank you for your cooperation. Can I see Dalmat's desk? Right there. What was it you said? "An important and valued member of the team?" Was that it? Let's go now, please. I've decided to investigate Mr. Dalmat's working conditions. I'll need all his paperwork. There are two investigations. Our Health and Safety, and the Health Authority. This'll make three. Mine is a penal investigation. We could be held personally responsible. Nonsense. She's just trying to scare you. Patricia, could you give Emilie the comprehensive risk assessment report? Right away. Work inspectors are scumbags. Tell me, has anyone here done anything wrong with regard to Dalmat? He and Paynot didn't get along. We already covered that. What else? He'd gone mobile and was awaiting relocation. We have a thousand who've gone mobile. Anything else? We'd just sent him an email refusing his transfer. First refusal? Third one. We'll need to cover our tracks. Understand? Tell me you understand. LAST MAIL RECEIVED Hi. You scared me, Vincent. I scared you? Me? Sorry. You ok? I mean, are you holding up? I haven't slept in 3 days. I'm in great shape. The funeral's today? I'm here. Froncard wants you to dispatch Dalmat's workload. That'll be quick. And clean out his desk. Ask the cleaning woman. His personal belongings must be given to his family. So? You want me to do it? Ask Maury, he knows the family. Forget it. You shouldn't have come in today, Catherine. I'm fine, thanks. Jean-Louis? HR wants you to give Dalmat's things to his family. No rush, though. Right, Ms. Tesson? No rush? If it's not too much to ask. Maury, stop! Surprise! Yeah, surprise! Here you go. Want my scarf? How'd your interview go? They tried to trip me up, but I think I did alright. Cool. What's the matter? An employee killed himself at work on Tuesday. I was his supervisor. I'm fine. It's not like he was family. Hi, honey. How are you? What's going on? Nothing. It's a surprise. Where're you going? - Wait! - Leo! What's going on in Financial Services? There's been an incident between 2 employees. Shall I tell the higher-ups we break each other's faces now? You're supposed to keep shit from happening. Is that clear? So where did you go? I ran after Jean-Louis Maury. Then spent the weekend with him? I want you to answer when I phone. Do what it takes to keep Paynot from pressing charges. Replace him at once, and suspend Maury until he settles down. No more waves while the inspector is investigating. Is that clear? Yes. What's on the agenda? Stéphane? I did my job. I'm not taking the rap. What is your job exactly? Can you tell me? Pushing people to kill themselves? We both know why you hired me. What are you playing at? Are you threatening me? I'm thinking ahead. I see. A little friendly advice: be very careful what you say. Thank you for that. - Hello, Ms. Tesson-Hansen. - Can I help you? I'd like to start interviewing the employees. Is the office I requested free? I'm not sure. - I'd like to see Xavier Paynot again. - He's absent. - Jean-Louis Maury? - Absent. I came to see the work inspector. Hi, Jean-Louis. Come with me, please. I'm seeing the inspector. - Can I see you afterwards? - What for? Xavier Paynot is no longer manager. He's being transferred. So? Let's wipe the slate clean and start fresh. I need you, I need your experience. I want you to be our new FS manager. Didier deserved that job. Surely you don't expect me to accept? We made some mistakes. You can help us stop making them. You can help us change things. You won't get me, Ms. Tesson. I know who you are. Mind if I record this? Is it legal? It's illegal not to inform you. That's why I'm asking. Do as you like. Anything you say may be used in a court of law. Article 441-7 of the Penal Code states, "Falsified information or documentation is punishable by one year in prison and 15,000 euros." Why tell me this? I'm required to. I tell everyone. Can you give me your job description as it stands today? HR Manager for Financial Services at Esen's head office. I handle HR development. Evaluations, mobility, career tracks. Since when? January 5th, 2015. What did you do before? What're you doing? Where are the real questions? Tell me what you'd like me to ask you, then. "Corporate, Proactive... A Key to the Future of Esen" By Stéphane Froncard. What does that mean? Ask Froncard. "Corporate: Devoted to the company. Proactive: Taking responsibility for your own life rather than blaming outside circumstances or other people." Does that resonate? Why did Dalmat get the worst evaluation when he had the best results? Why was Paynot promoted instead? Why was he pressured to go mobile? Why were his transfer requests denied? Are those the real questions? I was doing my job. It's possible that while doing your job, you compromised his future by pressuring him to quit. What am I facing? You could be charged with moral harassment or involuntary manslaughter. If I can prove you wanted to get rid of him. What're you doing? I came for the interview. If I'm hired, maybe I'll see my wife more. How'd you get in? With my card. "Night visitor." You quit a job as Director of Communications in London. What made you leave? In French. As it happens, my wife was offered a job at Esen's head office in Paris. A senior management position. What motivated you to make that sacrifice? I saw it as a new opportunity for me. I love a good challenge. Are you prepared to make the same sacrifice for your employer? I always try to act in my employer's best interest. But what if, for example, your wife had to move again? Is your wife more important than your job? Bad answer. Mind if I take off my blouse? Go right ahead. I see you haven't worked in over a year. Why not? I... took this opportunity to care for our son. I've only just begun looking. We need a man with balls. Got balls, Hansen? Enough about your wife. We need someone who's not afraid to do the dirty work. And who does it clean. Do you know the type I mean? I believe I do. We need someone who will rid us of employees without firing them. Can you do that? You must be sure. There's no room for error. So, Hansen... Are you cut out for the job? Stop moral harassment. This affects you. Health and Safety investigating. Stop moral harassment. It affects you. Say no to Ambition 2016. Stop moral harassment. Froncard requested files. You were out, so... Good, Sophie. Always obey Froncard. Excuse me. What did he want? Stuff from Chamonix. Is Stéphane in? He's unavailable. He wants to discuss Chamonix. Stop it now! What's with you? I'll tell him you came. Lunch? My treat. Here comes Tesson. Come. Froncard asked me to schedule a workshop on psychosocial risks. To learn stress management. I don't think he wants you involved. What'd he say about me? That you fucked up with Dalmat. I got rid of him, he should be glad. Don't say that. Why? You think I fucked up too? I could've been in your shoes. Don't put yourself in my shoes. - You've got the Chamonix videos, right? - Yes. Give them to Patricia. I wouldn't want them to be misinterpreted. I understand. Locked out? I must've left my coat at the cafeteria. No more wine at lunch, Vincent! See you at Florence's leaving party? KNOWING HOW TO BE GRIEVING CURVE Can we talk, Stéphane? Not now, I'm saying a word for Florence. All good, Sophie? Making progress with Stéphane? All good. Listen up, everybody. We've all just been through a very difficult time. And in times like these, we realize just how hard our profession can be. But we also realize just how strong our team can be. We appreciate the personal and professional qualities of each member. Flo! I can call her Flo, now that she's leaving! The Koreans are lucky. They're stealing our most brilliant HR, and the only woman who ever got flowers from a guy she'd just fired. You ok? How about you? And your girlfriend Flo? Hurry up, tonight's your last chance. Tell me, what are you up to? What do you mean? Why were you in my office? Looking for this, maybe? What does that mean? Management of know-how? No. Management of knowing how to be. Emilie Tesson-Hansen... What is she? Only the best element in management today. A star, a role model. She did have great teachers. Recently, she began... How can you send me so far away? You know my mother is ill. I don't understand. Do I know his mother is ill? Of course. That's why the transfer is far away. I don't get the logic. It's simple. Xavier, the man's mother is ill. What? Froncard wants the videos. I'll erase them if you ask me to. Just say the word. Think you've got me now? Think I'll sleep with you to save my hide? I'm on your side, Emilie. Go ahead. Give Froncard his videos. Stop jacking off to them. He's anxious to fuck me, too. So, either he takes her with him, or he quits, to stay with her. Your job is to make him understand we can't decide for him. It's his choice. Get it? Maybe if your acting was more convincing... Hang on a second. Isn't this pretty sleazy of us? Pardon me? What I mean is... This is an exercise. We wouldn't do it in real life. What do you mean, real life? Anyone else think it's sleazy? Is it sleazy to help people take responsibility? Make their own decisions? What I find sleazy is letting people rot in denial and lies. No? Shall we continue? Sorry, I can't do it. Thank you, Xavier. That's all we can offer you. How can you offer me a position so far away? You know my mother is ill. I know this is a difficult time for you. Believe me, your devotion to her only makes me want to help you more. But my hands are tied, Mr. Dupont. And... I certainly can't make such an important decision for you. We obviously don't expect you to abandon your mother. Is there any way you could take her with you? Hi. I let you sleep in. There was a leaving party. You... need to get your strength back. You wanted to see me? Have you got some time? Follow me. What if I were to help you? Meaning? Froncard wanted to get rid of employees without firing them. Interesting, but we'd need proof. If I help you prove it, what happens to me? Your own responsibility would probably be mitigated, if you can prove you were following orders. That's not good enough. If I take the risk, I want a guarantee. What guarantee? A guarantee I won't be charged. I want you to protect me. I'd be happy to, but I'm not the judge. I'm not here to save your hide, Emilie. You called me Emilie. Ms. Tesson-Hansen. Late January 2015, Froncard held a seminar in Chamonix. He used to go there as a boy. He could show off his slalom on the slopes. Don't record this. Let me have it. Officially, it was an orientation weekend for new hires. In reality, we were there to present the Plan. To lay out the battle plan. There were twenty HR people, and as many managers. The big innovation was the behavioral evaluation. That was Froncard's baby. It was designed to root out noncompliant elements. Employees resistant to change. We weren't about to lay them off. They had to be... moved. And so... we had Phase 2. Encouraging mobility. It's like asking employees to sideline themselves. Phase 3, trench warfare. "You want to move? We have nothing for you. Draw your own conclusions." "Quit." We're not allowed to say that. The HR's job is to make the employee accept his fate, not to say we don't want him. How many employees are affected? Froncard never provided numbers. I know his goal was to shave off 10% of the workforce. Who, in your department? Two analysts who quickly got the message, and another who left on sick leave. Jean-Louis Maury, Catherine Tremblay... and Didier Dalmat. Do you have physical proof of this? This is all I could find. What is it? A document describing the stages an employee goes through when confronted with a sudden change. Where are you on this curve? Why do you care? I'm wondering why you're telling me this. I don't want to pay alone. This won't be enough. We'd need a stack of these. Have you got anything else? Hello, it's Emilie Tesson. Can I see you? I've got something for you. - The law states... - Business is down. We've had to adapt. But you must keep a ledger, it's required by law. I'll do it from now on. Do, it's important. I'll be back. New look? - I took the day off. - Good for you. I wanted to show you this. Shall I explain? What's A16? Employees I have to get rid of. What's it stand for? Ambition 2016. Froncard's brainchild. Did you fill out this form? Yes, on orders from Froncard. I gave a list of A16s to his assistant Patricia Suarez. Is it good evidence? Are you prepared to testify? Officially, I mean? If I do, I can kiss my career goodbye. So? Do you like your job? You could set an example. Employees of other companies might step forward. Yeah, right. "HR breaks code of silence." Do you actually believe you'll get Esen convicted? If I didn't, I wouldn't be doing this job. Excuse me. Yes, I remember you. Which worksite? Are you there now? The safety railings, right. Be right there. Thanks for informing me. I'll speak to Suarez. I'll question her about her use of the evaluations. And this... I'll keep. Good work. We're making progress. - Where are you going? - To inspect a worksite. Who called you? A foreman. See you soon. Can I come with you? This is my sector. 2,500 companies, 30,000 employees. Violations too numerous to count. Sorry. What's he doing? How many employees at Esen? 90,000 total. And the head office? 800. How many under your supervision? 73. I've got 30,000. I'm way more powerful than you. But I earn 100,000 a year. And I can't be fired. Where's the site supervisor? He'd be here if you'd warned us. This is a surprise inspection. You've done this twice now. Take me up there or I'll report you for obstruction. Then what? You get a year in jail and a 3,750-euro fine. This way, please. Ok. Still 20 centimeters short. We haven't had time. I gave you 10 days. What are you waiting for? An accident? What're you doing? There's a danger of falling. I'm suspending work here until you fix it. You can't do that. We're already a month behind. - Not my problem. - Give us a break. We'll do it, we just haven't had time! Work inspection! Everyone stop working! Come down right now. Work inspection! Stop working and come down, please! What's going on? It's the 20 centimeters. You're shutting us down for 20 centimeters? Gentlemen, go back to work. Thank you. - Out with those bitches. - What'd he say? "Out with those bitches." You have no right to insult me. You'll be fined for that. Do you realize 20 guys are gonna lose their jobs? I'm doing this for your sake. Want a death on your conscience? Come with me. Everyone come down. I'll be here to collect your names. It's protocol. Thank you, gentlemen. How's it going? Getting along with your new neighbor? Yes. Shall I introduce you? No thanks. I see no need for that. Listen... I think I fucked up. Putting the burden all on you. I underestimated the trauma it would cause you. You think? I pleaded your case to the higher-ups. They're offering you a new job. In New York. I hear the HR's office has a view of Central Park. Let them know by tomorrow. It's been a pleasure working with you. - Hi, Patricia. - Hi. Have a seat. Work inspector! Froncard called my supervisor. He claimed I harassed Suarez. He wants me taken off the case. What will you do? I'm independent, I do what I like. But if we come up empty, they'll send me away to inspect cows' asses. What'd your supervisor say? He said to focus on you, for moral harassment. What about everything I said? We have nothing on Froncard. It's your word against everyone else's. What? What the fuck are you doing with a work inspector? Trying to save myself, ok? You don't know what I did. - What's wrong? - Nothing, honey. Bedtime. You don't know who I am. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Here, watch this. - What is it? - Nothing. I'll read you a story. That's why the transfer is far away. I don't get the logic. It's simple, Xavier. The man's mother is ill. She's got Alzheimer's. You propose a transfer at the outer limit of his mobility clause. He won't drive 400km a day to see her. What do you want? Shall I call you an evil bitch and say you killed that guy? You're an evil bitch. It's your fault. You pushed him over the edge. Feel better? What more do you want? Do you want to pay for everyone? Think that'll change something? It won't. If you talk, they'll tear you apart. You'll never find another job. Guaranteed. Stop management's scare tactics. Health and Safety investigating. Stop moral harassment. Can we talk, Jean-Louis? I'm listening. We wanted to get rid of Didier Dalmat. I pressured him. We want you gone too. That's your defense? That's the truth. Ambition 2016 was to offload people like you. Do you realize what you're saying? You got it wrong, Tesson. We're offloading people like you. We'll be rid of you! Call Mrs. Dalmat and make an appointment with her. - Here? - Yes. What do I say? "Emilie Tesson-Hansen would like to see you." Please do it now. She'll say the same thing to me tomorrow. She'll say it to you, too. - What're you doing? - Stepping forward. Sure this is the right approach? What's that? You'll see. Can I see? Which one are you looking at? That one moving stuff over there. You can't see it, it's turned around. It was facing us earlier. Wanna do like I do, Leo? Pull to the left to make it turn... Hey, be serious! If you do it wrong they crash into each other. Press here. If you press them all at once, it'll rain. - Cats and dogs. - Ok. Everything? Is it snowing? - Emilie Tesson-Hansen. - Juliette Dalmat. Thanks for coming. Those are his things. I want you to know Esen is responsible for your father's death. Our Ambition 2016 Plan was designed to pressure employees into quitting. As HR, my job was to make your father quit. I was hired to do that, but I failed. Why are you telling me this? You should sue Esen. Here's the work inspector's phone number. Her name is Marie Borrel. She'll help you. Emilie Tesson-Hansen. This meeting is being recorded. Philippe? So... Our internal investigation of your handling of the Dalmat case has revealed you committed a series of errors with regard to Dalmat. We can't turn a blind eye. The case is too serious. From this point forward, your choices are as follows... Excuse me, what errors are you referring to? We know you committed actions in violation of Esen's code of ethics. Either you use any good judgement you may still have, take responsibility for your actions and resign, or we'll have to take a hard line, dismiss you for gross misconduct and let the judges do the rest. You think it's funny? Patricia, will you show her out, please? Maury came to see Stéphane yesterday. He asked if it was true he wanted him gone. That's what happened with Dalmat. What do you mean? What're you saying? What happened with Dalmat? He came the day he died. He asked Stéphane, "Is it true you want to get rid of me?" Stéphane played innocent. Dalmat grabbed his arm and said, "Say you want to get rid of me. Say it, and I'll go." Over and over again. Stéphane was very calm. He said, "If that's what you think, why are you still here?" Then he left Dalmat standing there. I didn't know what to say. Dalmat took the backstairs. Five minutes later he jumped. Patricia, wait! - Did he mention me? - Who? Dalmat. I don't think so. I want this to end too. So? I saw the videos. And? You're the main person we see. If I submit it as evidence, you'll be in deep. You're basically turning yourself in. What do we do? I'm all in. I want to testify. This'll make a lot of noise. It'll go on for months, years. You'll be at the heart of it. You do realize? Not really. I'll alert the public prosecutor. You'll be summoned to give a statement to the CID. - The what? - Criminal Investigation Department. Will you be with me? I'm live on Intranet at 10. What do you want? Shall I help you practice your speech? Shall I call security? My resignation, hand delivered. Will you sign a release for me? How did we come to this? I saw Didier Dalmat the day he died. I told him we wanted him gone. What did you say to him? When? When he came to see you. Before he jumped. What did he say to you? He asked if it was true. - What? - That we wanted him gone. You denied it? I told him it was news to me. I said nobody wanted anybody gone. I tried to reassure him. Maybe that's what killed him. Hang on... You want me to feel guilty in your place? It's your fault he came to see me. You destroyed him with what you said! If you'd done your job right, we wouldn't be here. The truth doesn't kill. Lies do. Stop babbling on about the truth! What should I have said? "Yes, Mr. Dalmat, we want you gone. Make an effort, will you? We've made you miserable for a year now. Why won't you leave?" Is that better? Can you imagine? An HR director saying that to an employee? I'm not completely irresponsible. Dalmat was free to leave. He killed himself. It's his responsibility. Not mine. Well, at least that's clear. What happened to you? You woke up one day with a brand new conscience because couldn't do your job? Did you think it was easy? I picked you for a reason! We're responsible for our employees' safety. It's not about morals, it's the law. So go get a job as a work inspector! Tell them how many employees you've offloaded! Ever wonder what happened to them? Go see how they're doing, in your shiny BMW! Buy them some tissues and cry with them! You make me sick. I fought for you. I thought you'd go far. I couldn't have been more wrong. Here. Stéphane, it's time. She's leaving. I didn't know Didier Dalmat. His death came to me, and to all of us, as a great shock. For an HR director, it's more than a shock. It's an ordeal. Esen's management faces its responsibilities... Can you put this on Intranet? The HR has resigned... - What kind of file? - WMA. You have to convert to MP3. Will you do it for me? I didn't betray you. I didn't say anything. How did we come to this? I saw Didier Dalmat the day he died. I told him we wanted him gone. I told him it was news to me. I said nobody wanted anybody gone. I tried to reassure him. Maybe that's what killed him. "Yes, Mr. Dalmat, we want you gone. Make an effort, will you? We've made you miserable for a year now. Why won't you leave?" Is that better? I'm not completely irresponsible. Dalmat was free to leave. He killed himself. It's his responsibility. Not mine. Well, at least that's clear. What happened to you? You woke up one day with a brand new conscience? You stirred up a big kettle of fish. Shall we? What do we do with this? We won't erase it. We'll use it. Hello. Charles Hourdin, Deputy Public Prosecutor. Emilie Tesson-Hansen. - Marie Borrel, work inspector. - Let's go. We won't be needing you, Miss. This way. I'll leave you to it. Thank you. Have a seat, please.
