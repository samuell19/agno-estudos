Can you tell me about your best career achievement? Your best accomplishment at work. Can you tell me where you see yourself in five years? Five years... Where do I see myself? Another five years... Hi, Mr Mahmoud. - Hi... - Stay put, I know my way. Mr Mahmoud, I printed two sheets. One pound. Sorry, Mr Mahmoud. I have no coins. It's worn out, but valid. Bye. Captain! Yes. Come. - What's your name? - Wael. Read here, I don't have my glasses. Is this an "H" or a "W"? It's an "H". If you're Wael, who are "H" and "S"? I don't know, Mr Mahmoud. I'll go now, I have an exam. Bye. MAHMOUD PHOTOCOPY I wonder who broke the promise. H or S? Are you refurbishing? Come on, Mr Mahmoud. I've been begging for your shop but you cling to it. Did all your machines crash at once? What are you saying, you lucky man? I've never seen your shop closed. Where were you yesterday? I went on an errand. It saved you from the copyright police. They took all my devices. What? I've been running all day, luring them to get my devices. I got them for five grand. You mean five hundred? You're naive Mahmoud. - Five thousand. - My goodness! But it's an idle season. If it was, I would have left them my machines. I'm a cybercafé not a copyshop. What can I say... They're different, like Halema Boland and Angelina Jolie. You don't know Angelina Jolie. Not even the first one. God make it up to you. God bless you. Bye. Good evening, Mr Mahmoud. Hi, Mr Hosni. Any news? It'll be all right, Mr Hosni. What shall I tell you? You're an owner, not a tenant. Any owner, either of a flat, a building or a shop, He's supposed to bear maintenance expenses. I told you many times. I know, and I pay. You missed three months. The fourth is almost over. Help me a bit. Sorry, Mr Hosni. The market is dull. Dull? If I may say so, I have the impression that you're playing dumb. Playing dumb? I wish I could, Mr Hosni. Good evening. Good evening. Welcome. You know better than me, Mr Hosni. July, August and September are off. There's no work. But it'll be alright. I hope. ASAP. You know why I need the money? I need to paint the faÁade, water leaked into it. The painters drove a hard bargain. I got it, Mr Hosni. Good bye. Good bye. Abdel Aziz. Abdel Aziz. No one can find him now. He's quicksilver. I never find him when I need him. Can I help you Mrs Safiya? - I want to go to the pharmacy. - I'll take you there. Hello! - Hi Mrs Safiya. - Hi Doctor. - How are you today? - Fine thanks. - Your insuline shot? - It's all I need. Why did you wait? Slowly. Abdel Aziz is neither here to help you. Sorry for having bothered you. You never bother me. You have a client. Thanks. I won't miss him, my clients know their way to the shop. Thanks, Mr Mahmoud. - The shopkeeper? - Yes, Sir. I've been calling a lot. I was going to go. No, please. Tell me how I can help you. I need to make some changes to this contract. Ok, Sir. In the name of God. This contract shall be considered... Automatically cancelled... In case of decease of one of the two parties. Why such bad terms? The owner of my rented garage put this condition. He's afraid that my sons may keep it against his will. Seriously? Honest people from Qena would never do this. Aren't you from Qena? I am. How did you know? Don't you know I can read your thoughts, as the song says? Chill out, man! You name is written here Fouad Anis Salib. Born in Qena. This is a lease for a garage in Abbaseya Street. You must change your address on your ID. Or you will have to travel for every paper you need. Street parking attendants are crucial. No one in Egypt wants to park his car on his own. Traffic messed us all up. I used to bribe mall security monthly, just to keep my post. What was your job before this? I was a potter. My whole family works in clay pottery. But now it's over. No one needs a clay water jug to drink or to carry with him. Everyone turned to electricity and cold water. Let me do it. Give it to me. Thanks Abdel Aziz. Where were you? Mrs Safiya needed you. I checked an hot-water tank. I just took her a charge card. Turn the light off, if you keep it on all night, it may fuse. No. I don't want my sign in shadow. I'll get you a new bulb for 20 pounds. 20 pounds? Yes, Sir. For all my errands. I gather them all in one bill. Go cheat someone else. Goodbye. MAHMOUD PHOTOCOPY Hi Karim. I miss you, sweetheart. Sorry, I didn't know you sleep early. If you talked to me sometime... It's all right, sweetheart. We'll talk later. Good night, sweetheart. Listen... - Abdel Aziz. - Tell me, boss. What's going on? You don't know that today it's Love's day? The Egyptian Valentine. See those chicks who just got flowers. Love deprivation is bad. Can you be clearer? I don't understand. Sorry, pal. I have some business to get some reward. See you. You'll find everything on Facebook. Hello. Hello. Welcome. I need to type some papers. I marked the text in red. When you're done, do me a front page with this title: "Scientific Research on Dinosaurs" And a subheading: "Written by: Hisham Magdy". Be careful, only the stuff marked red. Last time I was blamed because I copy-pasted from Wikipedia. Copy-paste? Do you have a computer? Of course, and a printer. But I'm lazy to write and print for two marks soon forgotten. It's a very boring subject. God be with you. How long will it take? Fifteen minutes. Great. I'll go to the flower shop and be back. Bye. Captain! My glasses. The fossilized feces of dinosaurs have shown... That some herbivorous animals... - Fed on? - Yes, fed on... Flowering plants. Shall I dictate commas? Yes, also periods. Can you see if this is a comma or a period? I forgot! We'll take it as a comma. I'm abusing your time. Won't you give me a percentage? I'm kidding. Wait, I can't see. The text is hard. Let's go fifty-fifty. No way. Then it's better to stop. I won't finish the job and I'll lose a client. What do you say? Let's go on. Read it straight through. I'm quick. Ok. The supporters of this... The supporters... Of this theory told... That dinosaurs failed to adapt... To surrounding climate changes. Period. The stagnation that happened during their evolution... Was their death sentence. What does this mean, Mr Mahmoud? Is it done? Almost. I'm fixing the last notes. How come? It's taking too long. Never mind, son. I left my glasses at home. Mrs Safiya is helping me. Sorry for bothering you, Mrs Safiya. I've nothing else to do. I'll go and have my shot now. Wait and I'll come with you. No, Abdel Aziz is here. Abdel Aziz! Abdel Aziz, please, take me to the pharmacy. Excuse me. Sir. Will you print my stuff? I have to do an errand before my class. My teacher will screw me. Screw you? Is it for Valentine? It's Love's day. Valentine's day is in February. Do you want a rose? Are you single? Alone? No relationships? No. Are you single or not? Do you have any comments or can I print? Anyhow, this rose is for you, if you're single. If you're not, you know who to give it to. How much? Ten pounds. I wanted to ask you something Hisham. Don't you know why dinosaurs became extinct? Hi Basant. Your mother in law loves you. Dining on tuna? Are you skint again? My pension hasn't arrived yet. Again? It's the third month. I asked the bank, they told me to talk to the transfer administrator. Why don't you ask at the newspaper? It's on my conscience. It's ages since I last went. You can't live on tuna, Mamhmoud! - Where are my glasses? - What do you want to read? News about the blue whale. The IMF called for united efforts to save blue whales, Whose population decreased from 250,000, in the 30s, to 1000. Blue whales are the biggest animals on the planet, With a length of 30 meters and a weight of 130 tons. Did they say why it happened? No, they didn't. How strange. You're strange. You worry me. Eat some rice pudding. Did you take your decision? I did. Sameh will wait for me. We're set up to leave together. Hello, Mr Mahmoud. Welcome, Gamal. Are there any broken machines? No, they're all good. Do you need ink cartridges? No, I have a lot. You changed them months ago. Have you another supplier? No, I swear. There's no work. Listen, Mahmoud. Since things are so bad, sell your crown jewel. Find me a buyer. I know someone who has a booth opposite the Civil Register. He xeroxes personal documents. 0.25 pounds per paper. 0.25 pounds. I do that for 0.10 pounds and the shop is idle. If someone at the Civil Register forgot to xerox his ID, will he come so far? People are queuing for that guy. He needs another machine. Deal? No, thanks. Next time bring me a 70 grams pack. Ok. Bye. Good bye. Mrs Safiya. Go Abdel Aziz, I'll take care of her. Yesterday you said you want a share for the dinosaurs papers. He paid ten pounds. And this is for you. Are you nuts? Everyone is watching us. So what? They might badmouth us. I'm sorry. Keep it. Thanks. Excuse me. Mrs Safiya. Yes, Mr Mahmoud. I'll keep the rose. But accept my invitation. - No, Mr... - Didn't we agree? Let's see the world from where no one will see us. I like films. But I never go to the cinema. You never did? I mean I never went with someone. I always go alone. Accept my invitation to make me happy. Stop thinking. I'll save money for the weekend. Do you like your new position? It's not like being a department head with the most skilled typesetters. But in the end, I'm in the office of the editor-in-chief. You manage his office, his schedule, you write his articles. Does he still handwrite? He's old fashioned. I was luckier than those who were given lower tasks. Mortada Sayyed had to lick boots to go back to the buffet. - The buffet? - Yes. And the pension he took? He gave it back. He used to collect debts. But the buffet work toughened him. After we finish, we'll have a drink at the buffet. No. I'll settle my pension issue and go. I left the shop closed. How's it going? Fine. Which department? Typesetters. Mr Sayyed, do we have such a department? We used to have it long ago. When editors used to write articles with pens, Then typesetters would type them. Search in the old folders. Is the cinema far? Why does it seem it's your first time Downtown? It's true, I used to work 16 or 17 hours a day. Then go home. Then sleep and work again. I wasn't getting out. Let's have an ice cream. I have diabetes. Help yourself. No, my teeth ache. There's the cinema. Let's go. Only foreign films. It's the wrong season. Let's go home. No way. Let's watch that film. It's a cartoon. So what? We're too old for that. Don't age yourself. You're still young. People may make fun of us. They won't. Come on. Which film? The dinosaur one. Here, Sir. Trumbo. When the film starts, read me the subtitles, I can't see them. Sure. He says he missed his family. Did Arlo said that? What's your problem? It's ok if you can't read, but can't you even see the characters? I feared I would find whining kids. This is worse. It sucks. I told you it wasn't the case. Bye. Mrs Safiya, won't we finish the film? After what happened? I told you it's not for us. Maybe it'll mention dinosaur extinction. Do you think they will? I'm very happy, Mrs Safiya. I've never been so happy. I didn't want to watch the film as long as you were talking. You're so beautiful, Mrs Safiya. I'd better go home, Mr Mahmoud. It's been five years. I still feel something is missing. What is it? - You're beautiful. - You liar. I wear dentures, chemo made me bald. But you know, it makes no difference. Looking at myself in the mirror, that hurts. Feeling like a burglar. Fearing they could see what I hide. I miss many things, Dalia. Is it cold? Or am I missing warmth? It's cold. Let's get inside. Take your tea with you. I booked you a job interview. Again? I won't go. You will, for my reputation. It could help. Take this. What's this? I got my pension arrears. This is a present for your wedding. I want nothing. You deserve it more. You're the only one who cares for me. That's priceless. No, dear. It's my personal wish for you. Thanks, Sir. God bless you. You say you'll travel to a pricey place. Where? Melbourne, Australia, and I told you I'm not travelling, I'm emigrating. Won't I see you again? We'll see. Save money to visit me. Take care of yourself. Don't make me worry. Ok? Fill in this form. They'll call you. God bless you, masters. Make it quick. I want it over. With God's will. Can you bring us some tea to recharge ourselves? Tea? Just that? Of course I can. Hi, Mahmoud. Hi, Mr Hosni. Sorry but I can't invite you in, as you see. I see indeed. Unlike you. Why, Sir? What do you mean? You can't see the workers up there. The contractor is milking our wallets. You owe 5 months. You promised to pay, and you didn't. You don't give a damn. No, I swear. Tonight I'll send two months' fees with Abdel Aziz. Only two! You'll still owe three. That's a lot. What shall I do? As you can see, I'm very unlucky. Unlucky? That's how we do. Each time we talk about money, we says we're unlucky. Exams are approaching. Money will come soon. Inshallah. Type this paper on the computer. All that? It's only a few pages. You said you'll send two months? But three months missing is too much. Anyway, type this. I will, Mr Hosni. Dr Dalia told me she will come daily to give me the injection. To spare me the cold weather. It is cold. The great cold is still to come. They say: the great cold makes the young look old. Let alone the elderly. What are you saying, Mrs Safiya? You're just perfect. Excuse me? Let's call it a night. We reached the end, but we're not aware. Won't you go out again? I won't. Dalia will come. Will we meet only by chance? Pray for me. Mr Mahmoud, open the door. I know you're in, I can hear you. Mr Mahmoud. Open please! This may be the last time we meet. Basant, let's go. We can't wait any longer. Listen... I'll miss you. Good evening Osama. Hi, Mr Mahmoud. Welcome. See, my guys packed like sardines. It's unfair. Sell me your shop. I said I won't, Osama. Rent it to me. We'll make a good deal. Enough with this story, Osama. What do you need? Internet. Excuse me? I want to search for something. All the computers are busy. Maybe next time. Wait, Mr Mahmoud. Will you be quick? I will. One moment. Leave him your place. No, man. Don't be rude. We'll be quick. No Bazoka games, granny. Plaster your mouths! Please Mr Mahmoud. What do you want to search? Here we get answers to all questions, yes? I'll google whatever you want. Do you smoke? I want to know... Why... dinosaurs got extinct. Dr Dalia. Hi, dear. Come in. Give me a second. In today's music programme you will hear the following: "May you always be mine", "My bygone love", "Not enough", "Noura". By Fareed El Atrash. You must like Fareed. No, I like Laila Mourad. Don't be surprised. Laila was naive. You know Abdel Halim's song "Why you cheat on him?" It was supposed to be hers. But he slyly took it from her. They say also Fareed's song "My heart and its key" It was written for Laila Mourad. Once I was listening to the radio and I heard a recording of Fareed. He was rehearsing with the lute while singing that song. Then he sang a female couplet. A female couplet? A part written for a woman that he hadn't sung before. He sang: To the man who makes me weep all night, Your absence made me despise my life. If you leave me I'll wither away. I'll return before you can say. Since I heard it, I wait everyday for Fareed's program on the radio. Perhaps I'll be able to record it. You're the only thing that I await and that comes when I expect it. You don't have to wait. If I could only know what's your problem with the insuline pen. It's just to see you. Just to see someone. So you can be sure that I didn't fall into a coma. So that when I'll die, you won't know that from the stench. Why are you saying this now? God protect you from evil. Death is not evil. Evil is to lose all you have when you're alive. Your beloved ones, your health. Your womanhood. Let me prick your arm, and forget this weepy stuff. Thanks, Doctor. See you tomorrow. Welcome sweetie! Welcome. Welcome to such beauty. Hi, honey. How are you? OUR CONDOLENCES ON THE LOSS OF MR MAHMOUD... Can you read Abdel Aziz? How can you doubt it? I've a Middle School diploma. - Come, please. - Sure. - Show me. - Is this "Mahmoud" or "Mohamed"? Mahmoud. And this? Mahmoud too. The obituary page is full of Mahmouds. Tell me, Sir. How was the obituary page edited, when you worked in the press? Typesetters were out of this. Typesetters used to type on a computer handwritten content. The obituary page was on the technical unit. Death notices were sent to the ad unit and then to the technical unit. Got it? Good evening, Mr Mahmoud. Hi. You must be joking, Sir. What's your problem with dinosaurs? You could have talked to me privately instead of showing up in front of that bunch of badasses. I couldn't stop their laughter. You laughed with them. Because it was funny. Let's pretend it didn't happen. If you want to research dinosaur extinction on google, it takes time. Do you think that you can get this in a couple of clicks? You're a good man. Dinosaurs weren't killed by someone whose name will pop up in a click. You could have done research and printed it for me. I sold the printer to buy joysticks. Videogame tools. For those who laughed at me. If I told Abdel Aziz he'd laugh too. Tell what? I need Mr Mahmoud for a grown-up talk. I'm grown up. Now be clever and go. Shall I? - Ok, brown-nose. - What? Bye, Mr Mahmoud. I'll smash your face! Skullocop, the boy who said: "Dinosaurs, granny?" "If you were born a bit earlier you'd have met them.î" Is it so funny? Sorry, Mr Mahmoud, it's my fault. To show you my respect, I'll get you an internet connection. I'll do even more: the cable and the first two months are on me. After that you'll pay a 30 pound monthly fee. - Seriously? - Of course. You're my dearest one. When you'll discover the internet dinosaurs will be your least concern. You'll turn into a womaniser. Trust me. You're terrific, Mr Mahmoud. You two! Stop throwing your fag ends in my shop. What's this? What's this? Where's your boss? Who's the boss here? Sorry, Sir. Some paint accidentally dropped. Your apology isn't enough. Of course, Sir. I'll pay for it from their daily wage. If you accept this reward. God is the only source of reward. Good heavens. Thanks, Sir. Shut up and get your work done. Be careful next time. Handwritten by: SAHETY "BLUE WHALES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION" Sahety! Sahety! Sahety! What do you want, Bizo? This guy needs you. Tell me, Sir. I'm looking for Sahety? Tell me, Sir. I'm his son, Anas. Will I find him here later? Unfortunately not. He died. Really? No. He went to our Lord for a flying visit and will be back for dinner. What's wrong? What's wrong? Get me a sugary lemonade, Bizo. Sure. Sit down, Sir. Sit down. Calm down. There's no power, but in God. There's no power, but in God. He must have meant a lot to you. I met him only once. He made my shop sign. You're so upset even if you saw him just once? I even ordered you a sweet lemonade, which is a luxury item for me. You know how much sugar is today? I could have done you the sign! We'll use the paint tins for the goal. Go ahead. Let's go. The kids will play here. Go, Moksha. So you can handwrite my sign in the same style? Write? Who told you this? This is old-fashioned. Now computers do everything. With a computer? Not by hand? No panic. I've good digital handwriting. That's it, man. Cheer up with me. Let's have our drink. Handwriting has long gone. Everything has changed. What do you believe in? In the one true God. Sahety, God bless his soul, spent his last two years of life Without grabbing a brush to write a letter. If Sahety saw those kids playing with paint cans, he'd died on the spot. You know what? I can do everything that Sahety used to do. Signs, funerary banners, wishes cards, electoral advertising... I do this all by computer, I swear, Mr Mahmoud. Sir. Yes. Where are you going? I don't understand your question, or I fear my answer may be impolite. Is it your business? Why are you so angry? I saw you going from the pharmacy to home. I've never seen you before. I'm Dr Ahmed Shawqy and I'm going to Mrs Safiya. Where's Dr Dalia? Dalia is on holiday. I'm replacing her. Do you need anything else? I'll come with you. What? Where to? Why? Because Mrs Safiya can't be left alone with a man. I know that she is an old lady. She could be my mom. So what? That's the proper etiquette. As it pleases you, Sir. Let's get this done. Are you sticking here or coming up? Please, Doctor, I forgot my glasses, can you read me this paper? God give me patience. "To the owners of building 7" "Note that the annual meeting to elect the head of the owners," "Will be held next Tuesday after the night prayer at Mrs Safiya's flat." "The budget of the coming year will be discussed. You're invited to attend". Who signed it? Hosni Abdel Wahed. - Can we go now? - Yes, let's go. - Good evening, Mrs Safiya. - Good evening. This is the chemist. It's his first time here. He asked me to help, and I helped. Come in, please, Doctor. How are you Mrs Safiya? I'm fine. Thanks, Mr Mahmoud. I'll go now. Not at all. You can't go without having tea. Don't bother. There's no bother, the kettle is on the stove. Go ahead, Doctor. No, not at all. Nothing happened. I'm a bit late. Clients are leaving? Sell what you can, leave the rest to me. Ok, I won't be late. Bye. Bye. I said bye. Please, Doctor. Mr Mahmoud. Thank you. Sorry, but Mrs Safiya must have her injection, before I go. That's not polite. How much sugar, Mr Mahmoud? I'll have none, to show you my sympathy. That's very kind of you, but now Mrs Safiya must have her injection. Please. Ok, Doctor. Get well soon. God bless you. I'll go now. No, finish your tea. Please. Karim is beautiful like you? No, he looks like his grandma. Can I ask you something, Mrs Safiya? Go ahead. Why doesn't Engr. Karim come to see you? You know how life goes. He is young and numb. Oil business, life in the Gulf is hard. How did you know I have a son named Karim, and he's an engineer? You must have forgotten. A few years ago I typed for you a general proxy for Karim. Karim Ahmed Bassiouny. Touch wood. What a memory you have! Is this for real? I never forget what I type. Will you marry me, Mrs Safiya? Hello, Karim. How are you sweetheart? See, I called you before you go to sleep. How are you? I'll have my mammogram next week and I want to talk to you. No, I don't need money. Of course, love, I'll tell you. Sweet dreams. Take care of... Hi, Mr Mahmoud. Hello to you. - Congrats for the new façade. - Thanks, man. Where do I connect the cable? There. Would you wait outside? I can't work with you around. Please, Sir. Hurry, Sir. I don't have for ever. Ok. Dr Dalia. Dr Dalia. Yes, Sir. I need medical advice. Do you think a man of my age could... be able to have children? The truth is, a relative of mine wants to know this. A female relative. Mr Mahmoud, I'm a chemist, I need to ask a physician. Tell your relative, if she's your age, she'd better take care of her health. Better taking care of one's health. I'm done, Sir. This guy needs you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Do you have internet? Were are you from? I do have internet. Can I use it for an hour? Of course, my son. For how much? You're the first one to use internet here, pay me as much as you like. Do you have headphones? Headphones. Yes, there. Not those. Those are headphones. Not speakers, I need those with a microphone, to hear and talk. Those are speakers. They're good, a bit scratchy when it comes to songs. I don't need songs. Do you have a webcam? A webcam? No, I don't. No, you won't leave until you finish your tea. I must work. You can't make me wait till they play "My heart and its key". Never mind, stay with me a while. My mouth dried up for silence. You can go out and see people. No. I don't want to go out. Really? Or is there someone you don't want to meet? Is it so clear? It's clear for both of you. Maybe he is a spy. What? Don't you ever watch TV, Mr Mahmoud? Are there spies in Africa? I heard in two talk shows, they caught a Philippine spy ring. And African countries... They want to build a dam in Ethiopia to cut Nile water from us. God save us. What can a spy want from Abdou Basha? It's a strategic point. The Faculty of Engineering, Sono Cairo is round the corner. You know what is there? The archives of all our music and Quran recitation. They could steal all of it! A spy? When he comes again make him talk, close the door and call the police. Or the Army. They show their hotline on TV, I'll bring it to you. That's unfair, Mahmoud. I'm not a kid. - What's wrong? - Where's the money? Calm down. Every time I talk about money you say: calm down. What's going on? Calm down. I've already come too many times to ask for the money. Lower your tone. I won't lower my tone. Give me a deadline to deliver your arrears. I sent you two arrears. He truly means to pay... Two arrears don't make any difference, Osama. I told him. I swear if you don't pay what you owe I'll cut your water and electricity. That paint's price? What's today's date? 10 December. 1st January, with God's will. 1st Jan? You're kidding. You have no clients. They just come to ask directions. And you misdirect them. You keep talking about coming exams, the high season, but nothing happens. Why do you keep fiddling at your computer? What? You've so much time to waste that you watch animal stuff. 1/1, if you don't pay, you'll have only yourself to blame. Calm down, Mr Hosni. Come with me and calm down. God forbid! It's not animal stuff. It's about extinct dinosaurs! Animals still exist. They're all around us. Where are you from? Niger. The best people. Nigeria. Niger, not Nigeria. What's your name? Othman. Othman Selim. Did you come before or after the Revolution? I came in September. Before the academy year starts. Now will you let me finish my research? What do you research? Issake Dabore. Is it a friend who got lost? Issake Dabore is not my friend. You could say he's my inspirer. Do you know him? Niger took part in the Olympic games for the first time 50 years ago. We won no medals except for one bronze medal, Thanks to the Niger boxer Issake Dabore. What was the strange language that you were babbling last time? Babbling means talking? Yes. Haoussa. Who were you talking to? Aisha, my girlfriend. I haven't talked to her since I came. I don't know if her connection is good enough. I can make you hear her voice. On one condition. You should translate for me what you both say. But it's private stuff. That's my condition. Abdel Aziz warned me about you. What do you say? What is she saying? She says she misses me. She sees my face in the streets. And in small details. The pill you gave me tastes like Pyrosol. All right, dude. Osama. Yes, Mr Mahmoud. Can you tie a tie? Or are you too young? You should be big enough to do it. Come, I'll do it. My beloved dad didn't know how to do it. Mom used to tie it for him. He was so chic. Even once he retired, He used to have his tie tied, go to the cafÈ, and be back at 3:30 pm. When mom died, he started waking me everyday At 6:30 am. To the point I got used to it. One day I woke up very late. I rushed to his room for his tie. I found him dead. Don't jinx it. Take care of my shop. Mr Mahmoud. Is everything fine? Won't you invite me in? Come in. Welcome, Sir. I don't want you to be upset for my insistent demands. As the head of the owners union, I must protect their rights. I hope you'll be able to pay your dues before 1/1, as you said. Of course. Inshallah. Thanks for your oath. Now excuse us, but we have an owners union meeting. That's why I'm here. Excuse me? I'm proposing myself as the new head of the unit owners. Are you kidding? You're a tenant. You forget what you said, Mr Hosni? I'm an owner here. Like any other owner, of a flat, a floor, a shop, I have the same duties and the same rights. Listen Mr Mahmoud. I've no more patience. Will you marry me, Mrs Safiya? What do you say? You're crazy. I can't. I'm a widow. What does it matter? - It's wrong. People will see us. - So what? No way. I have diabetes. My son will never accept it. I can't. Listen to me. Stop bullshitting. The owners union is legally registered. If you violate my rights, I'll sue you. A threat? I'll carry the elections. I don't give a damn about you. He's wasting our time. Let me pass. I ran out of patience. Why? I knew that the owners union gathers here monthly. I thought about popping in to see you. I can't have a man in my life. You don't know me. You only know my appearance. Every six months I wait for you to come back from the check up. When I see you relieved, I thank God. Don't panic. I know you've been ill. Since the day you sent Abdel Aziz to photocopy your medical tests. I know. But I still believe That you're so beautiful. I'm not struggling with time. I just want... To take my chance... To leave a legacy. What kind of legacy? I wanted a child. A child at your age? When they used to assign me jobs They'd urge me to finish it soon swearing for my kid's sake. I have none. That word touched me. If I die, I will leave no legacy, as if I never existed. I'm asking for some company, and be remembered when I die. That's the company I await in that song by Fareed. "To the man who makes me weep all night" "Your absence made me despise my life" "If you leave me, I'll wither away" "I'll return before you can say" How? You've heard this version too? I've never met someone who did. I'm old, Mrs Safiya. Me too. That's why we can't. Sorry I'm wrong. I thought it was my partition. It's ok. Are you here alone? I am. Me too. Why don't we sit together and make friends? Come in. What's your name? Marwa. First time? Yes. Are you scared? Don't be scared. I've been coming here for five years. I can feel your fear. Enough, it's over. Enough, it's over. If you had kohl it would have melted down. Why didn't you put it? Not even lipstick. May I help you? Yes, can you get us a lipstick? A lipstick? Yes. Root around and get us one. Ok. Just a moment. Everything will be fine. Don't be scared. I'm not scared of cancer. Of what, then? Aly may leave me. Your fiancé? Even if he left, you'll find a better one who would die for you. Trust me. When God takes something away from us He gifts us something else. A brother goes. A lover comes. A son leaves. Something good happens. We grow old and white-haired. And we become calmer. Don't be scared. Is this good, Mrs Safiya? Yes, it is, dear. Thank you. Put some lipstick on. You have to be a beauty queen when you have your mammogram. A beauty queen is always stunning. Put it on. Congrats Mrs Safiya. You're doing well. Thank God! See you in six months. - Abdel Aziz. - Yes, Sir. You told me there are two Valentine's Days, when is the second one? Why do you want to know? I want to know. I'm not sure, it's either 14 or 15 Feb. When will it be announced? It's not like Muslim feasts. I just can't remember the usual date. Get me this info. I will. Tell me what you did with the spy, I saw him here yesterday. He's not a spy. He's just a poor guy, from Nigeria. Nigeria! The land of Africa's eagles! Like Yekini, Kanu and Amokatchi. Who? The best Nigerian footballers ever. Yekini cried on the goal's net. It was the best team in the 1998 world cup. Yekini was an awesome dribbler. Wait. THE OWNERS UNION IS NULL Dr Dalia. - Sit here Mr Mahmoud? - What happened? I'll tell you. Check him first. I warned him many times, but I didn't imagine Mr Hosni would do this. Can you explain yourself? The new head of the owners union was elected without Mahmoud's vote. I knew that from Mrs Safiya. He rebelled and covered the building with a sign: the owners union is null. The wound is small. No need to stitch it. Who did this to him? Mr Hosni was fed up, he fought with Mr Mahmoud, who got wounded. I see. I'm done here. Thanks, Doctor. How much? What? The medication. Now go, Osama. - Ok, Sir. Bye. - Bye. She's fine. I want to take her a Valentine. Are you serious? A teddy bear? No, hundreds of sheets with the question: "Will you marry me?" Like I did with the owners union. Mr Mahmoud, do you really want to marry her? I do. Don't you want also a couple of kids you mad man? I once had this silly dream. Please help me. What shall I do? Take her out on Valentine's day. How? I don't know. I'll say I can't leave the pharmacy and she'll come here for the shot. I promise our first daughter will be Dalia. I knew you were mad. Mr Mahmoud. Othman! Where have you been all this time? My exams at Al Azhar started. Meet my friend Othman. Like you? Yes, but he's from Sudan. - The kindest people. - Thanks. I have a surprise for you. Rashidi Yekini. Kanu. Amokatchi. Amokatchi. Who are they? What? Your country's best footballers. World-known Nigerian footballers. Even Abdel Aziz knows them. Mr Mahmoud. I come from "Niger". Don't mess me up. I'm Egyptian, and you? Nigerien. You see, were am I wrong? Ok, Mr Mahmoud. It's the same. Come in. What was that noise downstairs? Mr Hosni fixed Mr Mahmoud alright. You could say a public school bully against a French school angel. Is Mr Mahmoud fine? He had blood all over his face, he almost died. Strangely enough, he was laughing. He sends you this. - What is it? - He didn't tell me. Maybe his testament. Are you ok? Open it, Mrs Safiya. It could be a bomb. Now go. Thank you, Abdel Aziz. My heart and its keys are in your hands. It keeps calling you day and night. To the man who makes me weep all night, Your absence made me despise my life. Where's the shop owner? - Here I am. - Copyright police. - Welcome. - We know you have cracked programs. Everyone has. Shut up! Ok, Mr Sayyed. But keep your tone low. Take away the machines. Never mind, Mr Mahmoud. We'll sort it out. You see Mr Mahmoud. I told you he's a spy. SAHETY: 241412 I told you: less than an hour. Fast and easy. My dear Mr Mahmoud. Happy Valentine Mrs Safiya. WILL YOU MARRY ME MRS SAFIYA? Mrs Safiya. Mrs Safiya. Shame on you! We're too old. I want you to be happy. My son won't agree to this. Mrs Safiya, Karim, your son, isn't here. What will people say? Whatever. An old man fell in love with a woman and married her. Come on, marry me. Mr Mahmoud. Come with me, quickly. - What's wrong? - Mrs Safiya is sitting at your shop. - Let me wear my clothes. - Come as you are. One of the neighbors saw me and your sign. He told Karim, who came, shouted at me, then kicked me out. I have no place to go. Calm down, Mrs Safiya. You've endured more. Shut up. Sorry for that. He's my son. My flesh. I'll get you out of this. Come stay at my place tonight. Carry the bags, Abdel Aziz, and bring Mrs Safiya to my home. - Where will you sleep? - I'll see. Thanks Mr Mahmoud. Mr Mahmoud. Mr Mahmoud. Mr Mahmoud. Mr Mahmoud. I feared for you. What's wrong? How do you say when you finish a game? Game over. That's it. Trust God, Mr Mahmoud. Come to my shop. Don't stay here alone. Take, Mr Mahmoud. What is it? Use it to get your machines and reopen your shop. Tomorrow I'll tell Mr Hosni to leave you alone. Don't dare! That's the one thing that adds a tang to my life. I never did it before. Playing dumb. As he said. Keep your money, Osama. I so much wanted your shop. But I understand. I feared it could be like tying you that tie I couldn't tie for my dad. Accept my money. No. Sleep here. I can't sleep. Then search about your dinosaurs on that computer. Teach me Bazoka games. So be it. Bazoka. Karim, my love, I wonder when you'll hear this record. Will I be alive by then? When you came back and I saw you. I regained my soul. But you didn't come to hug me and say you missed me. Or how hard it is to live abroad. You said: stay put. I've stayed put for all these years. Until I lost everything. Except myself. One day Mr Mahmoud came. I don't even know is full name. They call him: Mahmoud Photocopy. Anyway... Mr Mahmoud, decided to wake up, And open my eyes to the life I don't see. Mr Mahmoud is for me my new home in which I wish to host you soon. Shoot, Mr Mahmoud! Sayyed, release their machines. Here's the jewel I told you about. The photocopy legend of Abdou Basha. My goodness. It's in great shape. Of course. It was handled with extremely good care. I'll buy it. Is it a deal? It is. Thanks for bringing back Othman. Who? That's how I call those computers. Congrats! If you need to adjust it I'll fix it with my friend Tolba. Wear it and I'll tie you the tie. No, you won't. Why? I'll do it. Because I decided to live. Listen, Osama. You wanted my shop, right? Right. I'll give it to you, as a partner. So kids will play Bazoka games, when I'm on my honeymoon. You deserve. - I'll travel with Safiya. - You deserve. You rock! Your wedding drink. Who are the guys you brought to witness? Good people like us. God grant them all they wish. - Do you know them well? - I do. That one is Othman, from Sudan. That one is also Othman, from Nigeria. From Niger. I swear to God. Yes, Niger. Live in harmony and have sons. Make us an ululation, Dr Dalia. Congratulations! Let's hear what you recorded. PHOTOCOPY Where's my voice? It's accompanied by the music. Where did it go? You didn't record it. Did Abdel Aziz tell you how it works? Yes. He said to lower the volume and press this button. - Did you press the red button? - No. You didn't record. - Do you remember what you said? - No, I don't. Each time you remember something, tell me. I'll record it again.
