- Who is it? - Arthur. - Who? - Arthur. - Oh, I'm sorry. Come on in. - Hi, there. I just came to wish you luck. - Aw, that was sweet of you. I'm going to put on the mask, you can help. - This woman's been hurt! Someone call a doctor. - Any orders for me, Lieutenant? - Keep everyone back. I don't want anyone near her. - Yes, sir. All right, come on, let's go. - All right, stay back. Come on. - Stay back, back up. - Call the hospital, emergency! Have 'em send an ambulance at once! - Calm down. She's knocked out. Don't worry about it. - General Hospital. Where? Yes, right away. Emergency, send an ambulance over to the arena. That's right. Dr. Krallman. - Yes? - I'm to tell you that you have a meeting tomorrow at nine up in the conference room. - So early. Thank you. - General Hospital. - Ready, master. - Let's go. - But I feel I'm to blame. - And why are you to blame? It was an accident. The risk is there for anyone who decides to be a wrestler. - I never should have thrown her out of the ring. - But she would have done the same to you, if you had given her the chance. - Oh, I only pray that it's not serious. - And I hope you're right. How is she, doctor? - Fractured her skull. Are you related to her in any way? - No, we're friends, just friends of hers. - It's that she has no parents. - Oh, this is Lucy Osorio. - How do you do? - And I'm Arthur Martinez, Lieutenant of the Police Special Service. - Thanks. It's nice to know you, Lieutenant. - Same here. - Doctor, is it serious? - I'm afraid it is. A sliver a bone has lodged in the cerebrum, and we'll have to remove it surgically. Have them call Dr. Krallman for an operation emergency, and begin the preparations for the operation. - Yes, doctor. - Please come with me, so that you can give all the data referring to the patient and explain your part in the accident. - There's someone on the telephone, master. - I'll see who it is. Oh, and when you're finished, lock up the laboratory. - I always do, master. - Hello? Yes, speaking. Mm-hmm. And have you called Dr. Lamont? I'll be there as soon as possible. That's all. - Is that you, papa? - Yes, son. But you should be asleep by now. - I couldn't sleep. - You must try, Julio. Your sleep is very important. - I was just waiting for you. - I had just arrived when they called me from the hospital concerning an operation, an emergency. - But why did they call you again? - It was me they recommended. Now get some rest. I'll return soon. - I'll change. - Doctor, how is she? - Well, uh, please ask Dr. Krallman. He might know a little more about it than I do. Now, excuse me. - Dr. Krallman, will she be all right? - We've done everything that's indicated. Now all we can do is wait and pray. - Elena might die. And if she does I'm responsible for it. - Doctor, for each and every one of us, who day in day out has collaborated within this hospital, it has become very painful for us to arrive at this conclusion. In spite of all that we have done to save your son, the leukemia is gaining and seems to defy all of the advances of science. His days are now counted. - I have good news for you, Julio. Your analysis show a definite improvement. In the weekly seminar that was called early this morning, all of the doctors have definitely agreed with me that your infection has been detained, and that soon you will start a complete recovery. So now it's a question of time and patience. - Tell me the truth, papa. Are you sure I'm recovering, and that I'll soon be well? - Of course you will, Julio, I swear it. - Everything is ready, master. - Once I was faced with a situation very similar, when you suffered that terrible accident. Everyone assured me that you would die. Undaunted, I fought to save you. And now the two of us alone must fight to save the life of my son, who has been declared lost by our science. - And when do you plan to do the operation? - Right now, tonight. His hours of life are now counted. The transfusions of human blood have been ineffective against this terrible leukemia. I feel that the blood from an animal as powerful as that of a gorilla might annihilate whatever is causing the cancer in the blood. - But are you sure his system can stand this transfusion? - As it is now, no. - Well, then why are you going to run the risk? - I'm going to use the gorilla's heart. - You're going to- - Transplant the hearts, Julio's for that of the gorilla. Move the table over to the cage, and prepare the gorilla. The electrocardiograph, quickly! - Master, look! It's workin'! - Let's put him under oxygen. - Now tell me what it's all about. What happened? - I couldn't help it. I got very frightened when I threw her out of the ring. - So we're back there once more. Now, forget it. Elena will be all right. - Now you mustn't move. No talking, and by blinking your eyes you can answer me. Blink them if you hear me. Now listen to me. Blink your eyes only once if you feel pain. Once for yes, twice for no. Now tell me, are you feeling any kind of pain? Get a little rest. No excitement. I won't move from your side. You'll soon be feeling well. And now get some sleep, you must have rest. - What is it, doctor? - Nothing, calm down. Apparently the operation is successful. - I'm glad, master. I knew it would be. - It's too early to claim a victory. We have to wait and trust in God. Come, help me drag the cadaver of the gorilla over to the incinerator. - Yes, master. - How is it possible that during one whole day no one has been able to find the animal? - Not a trace of it. - Then that indicates that the animal has gone out of the zoo grounds and must be wandering around the city. I'll have to advise the authorities so they could help us to locate it before anything happens that could be tragic. And don't take any chances or, if it's necessary shoot to kill. That's all right. Now get out of here! - Who is it? - Open the door, it's locked. - All right, just a moment. - Hi, there. - Hello. - How are things going? - I'm very frightened. - You starting the same thing all over? Why don't you think about something else? Do you know what riders do when they get thrown from a horse? - No. - They remount in the act. That's exactly what you've got to do. Continue wrestling or retire from the ring. Which, by the way, would make me very happy. - You know, I've been thinking about that. - About what? - Leaving the ring. - What are you waiting for? - The contract that hasn't expired. Monday's free for all here in the capital is the last one for me. - Is that a promise? - I promise you. - Swear it to me? - I swear it. - My darling. - Two minutes. - All right! Will you take me out to dinner tonight? - Yes, if you win. Of course I'll win! - Hey, wait. - What'd you find out? - Quite a few things. - Like what? - Like that door on the cage is all iron, it closes with a lock and chain, and the two things are still intact. - Make me our report on it, complete and clear, and I'll study it tomorrow. - No, it's gonna have to be tonight. The chief wants to see you right away. - What, again. Now what can I say to Lucy? Meet me in the office later. - Lots of luck, Lieutenant. - Who is it? - It's me, Arthur. - Not now, I'm taking a shower. - Open the door. I have to talk to you for a moment. - What's the matter? - It's just that I've got problems with you and I don't know how to tell you. - Well just tell me. - It's just that I saw Ramon, the sergeant, and he told me that- - That the chief has to see you in his office immediately! - Tell me how you knew. - Because every time you invite me out to dinner you stand me up! You never have a night free for me! - But that's duty, my love. - My love, my foot! You think more of your chief than you think of me, don't you? Well good night! - Master, look! - Oh my God! He's escaping! The rifle, Goyo, the rifle! - Here it is, master. - Go get my car and follow me. - Oh, somebody help! - Hey, what's happening? Come on, open up in there! Run for the manager, get the key quickly! - Right. - There he is! Drive around to the other side of the building, hurry! - Now, tell me what happened. Calm down! Please, now stop it! One at a time. Now reply to my question, but in order, please. Please! Please, one at a time. Please, or I'll never be able to understand you. - What plans do you have now, master? - None. This is horrible. For the moment I'll keep close watch so that he doesn't escape. I was prepared for everything, but not for this. I was prepared for a case of refusal for autoimmunization, which might affect the normal tissues such as the pleura and the red blood cells, but I never thought it would affect the cerebrum. - The cerebrum? - Yes. And what is more probable is that the heart of a gorilla is much too potent for any human, and the volume of blood to the cerebrum, which couldn't control this great pressure, damaged the superior parts. And when this happens man becomes an animal completely without control giving origins to the transmutation. The malignancy of the case is that the process might occur each 45 seconds, the time it takes for the blood to circulate through the normal body, at times as much as a minute or a little more if the person is in a state of unconsciousness. - How much time, master, for this transformation? - It's always impermanent. It might last for days or hours or minutes. - Are you trying to tell me that at any moment Julio might return to normal? - That's right, but his cerebrum will have been lesioned forever, and he might repeat the transmutation, converting once again into a beast or vice versa, this way continuing the cycle. Suddenly an idea occurs to me before it becomes too late. - What is it, master? - Invert the process, before the lesioned cerebrum becomes irreparable. - Invert the process? I don't understand. - To do a new transfusion, and a new heart transplant from a human, from a person still alive to him. - But a person acting as a donor in this would die. - I know, Goyo. I know. Can I count on you? Please help me. - Yes, master. - Remember that woman whose skull operation I did? Just what we need. - But that would be a crime. - But justifiable. That woman will die regardless. A little sliver of bone lesioned the cerebrum. And if by some miracle she lives, she'll be an idiot for the rest of her life. - How are you going to do it? - I'll do it here. - But how? - Tomorrow when it's dark, we'll take her out of the hospital without anyone seeing us. - But- - Goyo, will you help me? - Anything you ask of me, master. - Good. For the present you'll have to inject him every eight hours. This way we can keep him sleeping. And you'll have to close up that window. All of the precautions we take are still too few. - As you wish, master. - Good afternoon. - Excuse me, but could I see Miss Elena Gomez in number six? - Number six, so sorry. They still have the same orders prohibiting all visitors. - But could I find out how she is? - One moment. Someone is asking about the patient in number six. Thank you. No change, she's still unconscious. - Oh. Help! Oh, please! - What just happened? - Over there in the park, there's some horrible monster that's trying to kill my boyfriend! Help him, help him, help him! - Call the police! - He must be over there, get closer. What's going on here? - I guess somebody got mugged over there in the park. Oh, a dead man, a dead man! A dead man, a dead man! - Who yelled? - I did, sir. There around the corner there's a man and he's dead. - Call into headquarters. - I already did, sir. - Right. - Goyo, get the car before more police show up. Bring it over there. - This one's still breathing. Use the stretcher. Boy, oh, boy. This one's been murdered, ripped to pieces. - Leave him there. Apparently, there's another victim just around the corner in an alley. You go with him. - Yes, sir. - Stretchers, follow me. - You know them? - The wounded one that they took away is the owner of that little shop. - And him? - Him, no. It must be the boyfriend of that girl that came to the shop screaming. - You stick here. You others check every inch of the park. Let's go talk with her. - This way. - The cops are there, and the patrol cars. Help me, hurry! - Come on, dear, drink her down. - All right, get all of these people outta here. Come on, get back! Get out! - All right, you heard the man. You heard what the man said, everyone out! - Now are you calm enough to tell me exactly what happened out there in the park? - Four is a new total of victims claimed by the gorilla. The new addition is Joseph Ramirez Garcia, who died early this morning. The police think that the gorilla that escaped four days ago from the zoo is the assassin. - Connect the electrocardiograph. Turn it on. Burn the cadaver. - Doctor, doctor, come quickly! - But this is impossible! Come on! Please get me a line through to Dr. Krallman right away, it's urgent! - Yes, doctor. - Hello? I'll go and call him. - Who is it? - It's the hospital, master. - I expected. - Have they discovered the disappearance of the woman? - Naturally they have. The body is destroyed? - Yes, master. - Then remove all traces of the ashes and burn wood to substitute them. Nothing should be left in case we have visitors. Wait for me while I answer the telephone. Hello? Yes, speaking. But this is absurd! It's completely unpardonable! You've checked the whole hospital, the gardens? Well do it then at once! I'm on my way over. I'll leave now. - Dr. Krallman is coming right over. Now you check the hospital from top to bottom, and you check the gardens and all of the outbuildings. - Hello, General Hospital. - This woman has been in a coma for seven days. Now can one of you explain to me how she was able to get out of bed, much less leave by a window? If she had gone by a hallway she would have been seen. Unless- - Unless what? - Unless she were kidnapped. - But by who, and the object? - That's exactly what I would like to know. And now, doctors, I think our duty is to report to the authorities. - But that would be disastrous for the hospital. - Our colleague's right. Our reputation would suffer for it. - Yes, it's the truth. We find ourselves in a situation that's difficult. But please recall that the persons who accompanied the sick woman when she came here would be obligated to- - Pardon me for interrupting, doctor, but permit me to remind you that the woman has been prohibited all visitors since she came out of the operation. - Of course this gives us the opportunity to cover her disappearance. - But only a few days, no more. - Very well, doctors. But then what are we to do? And meanwhile what are we to say to the personnel of the hospital? They all know what's going on. Of course her infirmity is now critical, or a high fever might produce what commonly is called delirium. Of course the woman might have been a sleepwalker. - A sleepwalker, any sleepwalker gets up, and she could have jumped out of the window and escaped. - Or got lost. I've got the solution. - And that, Dr. Lopez? - We'll tell the personnel of the hospital that this woman, in a state of somnambulism, has disappeared. And that we ask the most absolute discretion for the good name of our hospital, while the directors conduct their investigation of the case. - And I agree with Dr. Lopez. And besides we must give a strong reprimand to the personnel. - If this is the opinion of the majority, I'm agreed also, but with one condition. If after passage of time our investigations have not resulted in our being able to locate the sick woman, we immediately go to the authorities. Do you all agree? - Yes. - I agree. - Well, then that'll be all for now. Good day, doctors. - All of the crimes were committed in this sector. And now look at the prints they picked up from the window, at the scene of the first crime. Show them the pictures, please. - Observe these. Those lines on the first print are human, but the others aren't. Maybe they belong to some animal that I'm unable to identify. - But they're not made by two different persons. Or to put it more clearly, it's that the two of them are made by the same person or thing, whatever it may be, person or animal. Is that it? - Yes, sir, that's right. - And now I wonder if the doctor will tell us what he encountered when he performed the autopsies on those two cadavers. - The trachea and the cervical vertebrae of the two murdered by strangulation were completely destroyed. The assassin must be very strong, especially in his hands. - Similar to a gorilla? - Could be, but I don't think of an animal strangling a person like this, as would be done by a human. It would tear with its nails, or biting, or by embracing with such force as to destroy the thorax, as in the case of the cadaver encountered in the park. - In that case it might have been the gorilla. - Might. But the declaration of the only person who saw it, the pretty girl who was with her boyfriend in the park the night he was murdered, doesn't coincide with a description of the gorilla. - And the conclusion you're trying to draw? - That the gorilla didn't escape from the zoo, but that it was stolen. If it had escaped, well a gorilla just can't disappear in a city as small as ours is. Besides, no one has seen it. And if somebody did find it, huh, I don't think they'd take it home for their children to play with. - I don't think there's any time for your jokes. - Please pardon me, but I wasn't trying to be funny. It's just that we're face to face with a terrible reality. What I'm going to say, just might sound absurd, and could only happen in this century. But from all of the proofs you have just seen, and the declaration of the young girl, I have come to this conclusion, that whatever committed these atrocities is a beast, yes, but a horrible half beast half human. - I'll say that's absurd. The proofs are circumstantial. It's more probable that of late, more and more you're watching on your television, many of those pictures of terror. - Have you seen the paper? - Leave it on the bureau. And they believe that some horrible half-man half-animal is responsible for the crimes that have been committed. It's unbelievable that such things can happen in the 20th century. What are the authorities doing to clear up the case? Six hours, dear Lord, I only need six hours. Thank you! Thank you, dear Lord, for giving me back my son. - Miraculous! Miraculous! - It's necessary to get him out of here while he's still asleep. - No danger by trying to move him? - That's a risk that I'll have to face. Possibly he'd recognize where he is causing traumatized emotions, and a crucial nervousness that could give rise to a new transformation. We'll carry him. Carefully now. For two nights I haven't gone to the hospital. I'll go now, I don't want anybody to get suspicious. Stay by his side all night. Give him another injection in one hour. There's no danger as long as he's sleeping. Besides, I could return at once. - I'll be here, master. - Don't close the door! Leave it open so that you can hear him just in case he needs you. - Osorio winning two out of three falls, retains her crown! - Gomez. Oh, hello, Lieutenant, how are you? Sure, I know you miss me. Tell me, what can I do for you? - Sergeant, hook me up with my girlfriend at the arena. - Sure. It'll be a pleasure, hold on a minute. Gomez. Communications, Car 25. Hook it up to the dressing rooms in the arena. It's urgent. - Hello? Yes. - Hello, darling. I listened to the radio, and you were wonderful. - Where are you? Not again! But you've been there four nights in a row, haven't you? - Baby, why don't you come out here and join us? Yes, here, we'll meet you on that little side street near the park. - Okay, I'll leave as soon as I put some clothes on. See you, my love. - Everything is pretty calm. - Yeah, the calm before the storm. Ease up to the patrolman. - Right. - There's nothing new, Lieutenant. - Who is that just left that house? - Dr. Krallman, he lives there. - Dr. Krallman. - It's that no one dares to go out. - But he did. Better keep your eyes wide open. - Don't worry, Lieutenant. - See you later. - Good night, Lieutenant. - Good evening, young lady. - Good evening, doctor. - Julio! Julio! Oh, my God! Julio! Julio, it's me who is talking. It's your father, Julio! - Oh, somebody help! - Hear that? Back there, come on. - It was the monster. He ran over to the park. - He's been murdered. Call an ambulance and the patrol cars, have them surround the zone. - Yes, sir. - Don't shoot, it's my son! No, no! - Lucy! - Come take a look at what we found in the cellar. - Hey, Lieutenant, how about giving us a statement on your investigations for the afternoon finals? - Bear with me, Charlie, I can't tell you anything right now. It's a big case and it's difficult. See me later, huh? - This way, Lieutenant. - Don't let anybody come down. - Look at that. - Hmm. - And now take a look at this. - Have it analyzed. Any identification on the man encountered in the park? - It's the son of Dr. Krallman. - He just might give us a clue to the case. Where did they take his father? - Both are in the same hospital, Lieutenant. - Come on. - Oh, somebody help! - Don't be frightened. I'll see what it is. - Help me, there's a monster in there! He's right behind me! - I'm from police headquarters. I want to see the sick man who was in this room. - What sick man? He's a monster. Murdered a doctor and took off towards the roof, and on his way he took a sick little girl out of this room. - Surround the hospital, and if he's seen, no one is to shoot. A stray shot could hit the child. - Yes, sir. - One of you call the emergency squad, have them bring a net in case he decides to jump. - Right. - How do I get to the roof? - At the far end of the hall to the left! What'll they do if they catch him? - Kill him, there's no other way. - Look up there! It's the monster! - Don't shoot! Don't shoot, he's got a child with him! - No, no, don't fire! Let me talk to him. He's my son. Julio. Julio, listen to me. No one's going to hurt you. No one will hurt you. Give me the child. Give me the child. Julio. Give me the child. Let me have the child, Julio. That's right. - He's gettin' away, fire at him. Julio! - Papa. - Please, Julio, forgive me. I lied to you. I lied to you, yes. When I knew that your sickness was incurable, I acted against the dictates of God trying to save you. Forgive me, Julio. Forgive. - For what? - Take charge of the doctor. - How did you discover the disappearance of Elena? - Well, Dr. Krallman went out of his mind, but he remained lucid for a moment and confessed everything. Poor fool. The desire to save his son from death was the cause of so many people suffering. - It's unfortunate, really sad.
