CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A CJ ENTERTAINMENT/AMBER FILMS PRODUCTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH WOOSU PICTURES EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG ASSOCIATE PRODUCER MICHELLE KWON LEE SUN-KYUN KIM KO-EUN JANG HYUN-SUNG LIM WON-HEE DIRECTED BY HUH JONG-HO Due to hand deformation from rheumatism, I've never held my child in the 7 years since her birth. JURY I heard a new drug called Lomix was effective, so I switched it. About 3 months later, - Today's a crucial day. - my body felt weird, so... Who is he? It's a malignant lymphoma. Even a name partner is barely enough. I got 6 months left to live. What'll happen to my child? The plaintiff's wish is to hold her daughter, that is all. The drug that she trusted has completely robbed her of her life! We request pulling Lomix off the market immediately. Plaintiff rests. Defense? Will you cross examine? Defense! Ah, right. What makes you so sure that Lomix is the sole cause of your illness? Have you been listening? There's no other cause! Clinical trial was conducted over 7 years on 3,500 patients, but there was not a single case where any components of Lomix led to cancer. - According to Food and Drug... - Then what am I? I got cancer from it, who cares about a report?! I see. I fully understand how you feel. One moment. Sea Snails Defense, what're you doing? It's to demonstrate a point, please bear with me. This is a common product out on the market. Please try some. Call the law firm. They sent us an idiot. How is it? Pretty good? It's not bad. Formaldehyde was detected in this product. There was a big case in 1998, where formaldehyde was found in canned goods. At the time, our plaintiff's lawyer led civic groups... Your Honor! This is irrelevant to current case! It has to do with the nature of this case. Continue. The manufacturers said the products passed safety tests, so it has no harmful effects, but consumers didn't buy it. Why? Due to media reports and civic groups' outcries, there were reports of people getting sick. The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court. And the result? FDA sided with the manufacturers because they deemed it safe. But not before over 20 manufacturers went bankrupt, and several CEOs of those companies committed suicide. Do you remember? Have you ever contracted hepatitis C? I'll ask again. Have you ever contracted hepatitis C? Yes. According to this latest report, it says hepatitis C can cause B-cell lymphomas. The plaintiff testified that only Lomix could've caused her illness, but I wonder what she'll think after reading this journal. Our country's best doctors and FDA stand by Lomix's safety and effectiveness! I too feel sympathetic to the plaintiff's pain and suffering. However! Please do not turn this case into another canned food scandal. I'm told he's their ace. - Ace? - Yes, sir. Defense rests. We cannot accept this judgment! We'll go to the Supreme Court, justice will prevail. Winning is justice, isn't that right? THE ADVOCATE : A MISSING BODY Suspect arrested in Sinchon murder case Yes? Boss. Congrats on Lomix case, great work. It was nothing at all. You were watching that? What do you make of it? The perp is caught, just need the body. Can you take that case? We were hired for it. Is he from a rich family? Don't joke around. Public defenders exist for those people. I'm not kidding, it's a worthy case. Got food on your face. Boss! We got a call from Lomix CEO! He really likes you. Seriously? You can't record anything inside. Your cellphone please. You must take your sunglasses off. How about blood and urine samples? When in Rome... Is this how they show off their wealth? Bori, come here. I heard so much about you, I wanted to meet you. And I also heard about the Lomix trial. I'm Moon Ji-hoon. I'm Byun Ho-sung. I wasn't told about how handsome you were. Despite how he looks, he gets the job done. He's from Prosecutor's Office, CID. I'm so fortunate to have met you on the same side. Please take good care of Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim? The Sinchon murder case. Oh, I see! He drove me for 5 years, he's a sincere man, hard worker. I'm told he's denying the charges, and no body has surfaced. I don't treat my employees only as employees. And I feel attached to those who come from hard life, like Mr. Kim. I want to believe him. How could you not tell me the client is chairman Moon?! Didn't I tell you? There's no body, but he did it. The only way out is reducing the sentence. No pressure. How?! It's straight from chairman Moon! This is why you brought me, I fell for it. He led Woosu Med from last to first in the market. He's heir apparent of the parent company. Work this right, and ride his coattails. There's nothing to work with, this isn't for me. Oh yeah, the lead prosecutor is Jin Sun-mi, a 3rd year SPO. Not a bad match. Who? Suitcase is gone? She arrived from an overnight nurse training camp. She was seen carrying it up on CCTV, but body and suitcase are gone from the scene. Family relations? Mother died when she was little and her father, 3 years ago. Holy shit. Kim Jung-hwan How did Han and Kim knew each other? Heclaims they were lovers, but her friends say she was single. Lover or stalker, that's the question. Why did you ignore my calls? Se-yul Good afternoon. Been a while, kiddo. Lead prosecutor, huh? Let's go eat. Greasing the prosecutor? I have no intention to eat with you. It's been a while, don't be so standoffish. Kiddo's all grown up, heading a big case. I don't exactly know why a greedy lawyer took a case like this, but I'm the prosecutor in charge. I'm not the 'kiddo' you knew, so watch your mouth. Hey, hey! What should I call you then? Boss? Big mama? No, no, no. How's 'hag'? Stinky hag? Hey. wait! You'll regret it, wasting your time on such headache of a case. If you're single during the first 3 years on the job, you'll stay single forever. Why is my marital status any of your business? Someone told me that extra effort on a troubling case will lead to a good verdict. That's something I said to get you to do my work. You're so naive. Kim had a prior with an assault charge. Don't go overboard. He's the perp. Do you think I wanted a case like this? Doesn't pay shit. I took the case because I heard you're on it, to see you. You must've made a mint, a new car and all. I'm just getting started. I got a payment plan for it. See you in court. I can afford to treat you... Be careful! Goddammit! Did the chairman send you? You must've worked hard for him, he really cares for you. Good fortune to have powerful friends, right? I'm told that you denied the charges. I didn't do it. Okay, to summarize, when you arrived at the scene, Ms. Han was gone, and the place was a bloody mess. Then why did you show up there? She didn't answer my calls, so I was worried. Worried over not picking up calls. Not out of rage? Why'd I kill her? I really liked her. Tell me just the truth. I'm here to help you. If you can't convince your lawyer, what good is a trial? Okay. You were worried, so you went over, then? Min-Jung! Min-Jung! Wait! How did you know the passcode? I saw her pressing them. It's her birthday, so it's hard to forget. Didn't call 911 in fear of accusation. I got a prior conviction. Prior... 5 years for assault, and a dropped homicide charge. This isn't good, misunderstanding is real. All right. Did anyone else know that you two were lovers? I guess not... Mr. Kim, think carefully. If you admit to the murder after a body or witness surface, even a big shot law firm like us can't help you then. Even though we get paid to go to trial, no one wants the rug pulled under them, especially me. So please be as honest as possible, got it? What's really, really interesting is that, in a crime of passion case, the killer usually leaves the body, and removes his trace. But here, the body's gone and everything else's intact. As a prosecutor, this is the point of contention. Stabbed or cut to pieces, these are mere presumptions without the body. Am I right? Did you dispose of the body properly? I did not kill her. Mr- Byun! Yes? They're Kim's colleagues. They wrote a character reference. I see. Thanks. Thank you. One moment. Could I talk to you? Character Reference Did someone order this? No, we just wrote it, hoping it'd help. This is useless, but there's something else I need. The prosecutor is theorizing that he was lovestruck, and when she rejected him, he went and killed her out of anger. He'd never do something like that. Right? I think so too. But his character is not what's important. Their relationship, that's what matters. I think I heard that he had a lover. Didn't you see her too? You must have! You're so close. I saw her? I did? This is completely useless. I did! I did! After my birthday bash, towards the end of the night. She came? You know, he introduced us. Weren't you introduced to... Han Min-Jung? Why do I not remember? She should be the one. Yes. Very good. We depended on you, what will happen to us now'? What about your mom in ICU? I'll continue to get my salary. Is that so? My gosh... The chairman is our savior. There aren't any CCTVs here. That's odd. I see that. Not one. Will it be possible to climb here? Yes, use the gas pipes all the way up. It's easy. Easy? Any determined thieves can get up, there, there, that's the route up. Wanna give it a go? Easy. right? Furniture Discard Notice Mr. Byun! Mr. Byun! I can't go any further! Can't climb! I just can't! Highest I can go! No more! You're almost there, step on that pipe! Now that I'm up, this is the best I can do! Can't go any further! Mr. Park? What? - Look here. - Look what? Come on! Take it now! Hurry! - Okay. - I'm dying here. - See you up. - Up? Get help! Mr. Byun! Call 911! You son of a bitch! - Boss, it's me. - Mr. Byun! My arms hurt so bad. Get me a forensics specialist. Yes. My arm's gonna fall off! No, not ex-CSI, someone expensive and smart. It's for the Kim Jung-hwan case. I may have something. Yes. I'm here... I'll debrief you later. Yes, do me this favor. I'll call you later, see you soon. So it is doable! Up was the only way. Jumpsuit looks too good, you look guilty. Wear this. If you get nervous, I'll call your right to remain silent. Just remember this. Today's spotlight is not on you, then who? Me. Please do not jump to any conclusions. Is he innocent then? The truth will be uncovered in court, I'll see you afterwards. Mr. Byun! Sir! So they looked quite happy? The defendant and Ms. Han? Yes. Did it look like he was stalking her? No, not at all. On the day of her death, Mr. Kim called her over 20 times. The prosecutor asserts that this is the basis of stalking. But what'd happen if your lover suddenly stopped answering your calls? Anyone who was ever in a relationship, would naturally go to her place. Isn't that a normal thing between lovers? When did you first meet the defendant? Well, I'm not sure, it's been so long. In prison, right? Yes. What was he in for, do you remember? Assault, is that right? Objection! This is an unrelated case. Establishing the defendant's violent nature. Overruled. After release, didn't you work at a company called Best Guard? Yes. It's got quite a reputation, hired to beat up labor unions and evicting homeowners. It was either them or us! So you admit it? Why does CSI treat this as a murder even without a body? Blood in our body takes up 1/12 or 1/13 of our weight. If you lose 30% of it, death is imminent. Judging from the clothes found at the scene, the victim is estimated to hold just shy of 4L. But we found close to 3L of blood. Survival is impossible. Is this the murder weapon? That's correct. How are you so sure? The victim's blood is on it, and defendant's prints are on the handle. That is all. What is your occupation? I'm a blood spatter analyst. I'm currently a Penn State U forensics scientist, and consult US federal criminal cases. This is a photo from the scene, could you explain? It's a normal projected pattern, sprayed blood stain. When artery is penetrated, the pressure sprays the blood. This is the shirt defendant was wearing. How'd you analyze this pattern? They're smudges from the hand. Not from the source, but the blood was transferred over. Was there any blood spray on his clothes? Not at all. It can't be from someone who made this mess. How do you explain fingerprints on the murder weapon? Human bones and muscles are quite strong, so considerable force is needed to cut through it, which'd require pressure on the knife handle. This would smudge the prints. So the prints were put on there? Objection! The attorney is leading the witness. Let's hear from the witness. Go ahead. Intentional or not, the defendant has held the knife, but I believe he did not apply pressure on it. Ms. Lee Se-young, the first person on the scene, stated that the door just opened. How did it just open? Electronic doorlocks lock up automatically. But as you see here, a battery was taken out. The lock never functioned. The prosecution theorized that the victim was stabbed, then carried out in a suitcase. But the defendant's clothes do not have any sprays, and there's high probability that he never used the knife. It's likely that he was framed by the real killer. I'm not interested in the real killer, and his motive. Because that's the job of the prosecution. They concluded that the defendant is the killer for simply having a prior conviction. From arrest to trial, his case was on fast-track! Police, prosecution, media and even you, never considered possibility of another option. Your Honors. Constitution Article 27.4 states that any doubt is beneficial to defendant. It's important to prosecute criminals. But it is even more crucial for our justice system to prevent penalizing the innocent. Defense rests. I killed her. Defendant, what do you mean? I killed Han Min-jung. Your Honors, one moment. - Kim Jung-hwan! - Stay back! Just a second, why did you do it? I'm his lawyer! Do you really want to die?! Kim Jung-hwan! In a wild twist, the defendant made a confession during trial. He claimed that it was premeditated rather than a crime of passion. He also stated that his colleague never met the victim. The defense lawyer is under suspicion of subomation... I'll cover it up, so keep a low profile. Heard of the Ha Yuri drug case? This doesn't make sense. Why'd he confess? Somethings not right! She'll be in tomorrow. The Lomix case was appealed, right? I'm pulling you out of that. If it ends like this, how can I face Moon?! You? Just follow my orders. Ms. Jin, there's nothing here. Maybe it's not here. What did I tell you, he's not the killer. You can't come in here! You don't know where the body is. Because you didn't kill her. What are you doing? No body, no murder weapon. Nothing to go on aside from his words. You have to go. Criminal Code 310! If confession is the sole evidence, - Pull him out! - it is inadmissible! Isn't it weird? Isn't it? If the body is found today, I'll eat my shoe! Get him out! Listen! If they find the body, I'll eat my shoe! Kim, how does it feel to screw me?! Get him out! Kiddo, there's no body, so don't feel bad and call me, okay? Get him out of here! Let go! Let go! Welcome. Shoveled all day, but no trace of a body, only rain. What are you doing? If Kim didn't kill Han, then who did? Why are you asking me that? Finding the killer is your job. But the killer confessed, and all we need is the body. Don't mess with us. I came to tell you that. Hey! I'm just curious. Why' re you so uptight with me? Still got lingering feelings for me? Shut up! Don't you want the truth?! The killer knew she'd be gone to training camp. He sneaks in through the back where there aren't any CCTVs. He wears gloves, lays mattress on the ground, then he climbs the wall to her room. Even my office manager Mr. Park climbed the wall. He puts on overshoes and waits for Han's return. And after she finishes showering and enters the room, he stabs her. He stuffs her body in a suitcase and tosses down to the mattress. He removes a battery from the lock, and jumps down. Waste collection was the following day. Included were 2 king size mattresses. I thought Kim was framed by the killer, but that idiot made a confession. It doesn't make sense. But there's 1 possible scenario. Why did he disable the lock? Kim had to be seen by a witness so that he'd be named. What's important is, Kim had plenty of time before anyone showed up, but he didn't leave. In other words, Kim wanted to be caught. Perfect, isn't it? Did Kim get a deposit? From his bank account, $30,000 in cash... was withdrawn. What? Withdrawn? Are you sure? Not a deposit? Wait... Let's just do our jobs. I'll do mine, and you'll do yours. I'll gather evidence and turn this trial around. I neither killed nor stole. Who cares what I do with my body? Ever heard of "Rule of 7"? Write down 7 names you got high with. Then I'll make a great deal with the prosecutor. Want me to sell out my friends? I'm not like that. And there were only 6 people. Then write 6, and any name will do. What about that rival of yours? He's doing this favor because he's myjunior. Law school junior? Special Forces. Are you serious? Salute! Salute! Absolute loyalty, absolute obedience! Loyalty that defies all, Black Beret Special Forces. Like you said, Kim's call log had a burner phone. Listed under "Kim Nam-june", but I can't ID him. Kim Nam-june? Can you triangular his location? But this is so illegal. Absolute loyalty, absolute obedience! The phone's off. Then can you get his call log? Wait, what's this number? "O Gil-dong", his is on. He was on the move, but stopped at a crematorium in Gyeonggi province. Gotcha. Crematorium... So his signal is coming from here? That's what I said! - Okay. - Bye. Wait. What's he doing? You're getting off?! What? I gotta see what he's up to. Must we do this? The boss thinks this is a closed case. We got here together, don't bail out on me! - Dammit! - What? Scared? - Eh? - Get out! They're on the move? It is them! Turn off the light! Taking something out of the crematorium? No way... Go follow him. Come on, scared? Hurry up, Black Beret! - For the last time! - Bullcrap. Go on! Hurry up! - Don't push me. - Get out. Meow! Meeeow! What the Shit?! What's that? Human hand? What the hell? What's this doing here? This is nuts... Shit! Goddammit... What're all these? Are these all bodies? Who's there? Who are you? The thing is... Loyalty that defies all, Black Beret Special Forces. How could you sell corpses?! I'm told they're homeless men. No family to pay for funeral. Enough! Desecrating corpse is a crime! Right, prosecutor? Of course! Criminal Law Article 161. 7 years imprisonment. Is that true? I really didn't know. I'm so sorry. I was selling it to the hospital. Bone powder for implants, skin for burn victims, joints and ligaments are transplanted. Dozens of lives are saved by one dead man. Look at it. Know this woman? Huh? Did you receive her body from Kim Nam-june? What? Sold it already? What body? Fess up! I'll toss you in prison. Who's Kim Nam-june? You texted him, and got a body from him. Or haven't got it yet? What body? Murder case body. Didn't he contact you to dispose a body? He's not disposing it, he's buying. What? Buying? Buy what? Corpse, of course. He's buying? Why? Don't know. It felt off, so I didn't want to, but he begged for even a head. He's paying $30,000. Wait... So Kim Nam-june is paying $30,000 for a corpse? When's the deal? Tomorrow. E-mail log Credit card transaction What's going on?! Why is the sentencing delayed? The investigation isn't complete. Kim doesn't know where the body is. So you'll free a perp who confessed? And if this turns cold? My bias may have made Kim as the sole suspect of this case. Did you meet Byun? Lead prosecutor influenced by the defense attorney? Very nice. Do you job! How should we proceed? This is how a cold case is created. Let's see this through. Let's begin. If Kim Nam-june texts, I'll check. Just do exactly as I tell you. Put the ice box inside the locker. Locker number 18. Passcode 2347. It's inside. Okay-. Pretend to text, and wait for a reply. Don't be nervous. Stay calm, act normal. Money is in locker #10 Passcode 1841 Money is in locker #10 Passcode 1847 I got the text. Pretend to check the phone. Check your phone. Ac! natural. Move. Money's in locker #10, passcode is 1841. Confirmed? I did. He may be watching from nearby. Don't look nervous and act natural, okay? So obvious! Don't stall. Get out of there! Get out. Damn it! All right, so it begins. Did you see? It's locker #18. If you want to help Kim, grab whoever opens that locker. Come take a look! Stay alert. We're not here playing detectives. Are you listening? It's a new energy drink, would you like to try it? We got a booth, please come see us. - When do you get off? - What? Um, I'm sorry. Hi! Would you like to try a new energy drink? Having fun? Please focus. Don't get distracted and keep your eyes on #18. - Okay. - Sure. Is someone really coming? Would you pay and leave the product? Please stay alert. - Look. - Yes? What is this? YDP Shelter List YDP Shelter Of course I know, she worked so hard. Other students come here to fill up their resume, and pretend to volunteer. But Min-jung was different. Do you recognize any of the highlighted names? Wait, Min-jung was... looking for them too. And these crossed out names haven't been around in 3-4 years. I know them all. They're all... suffering from rheumatism like me. But they haven't been around after visiting that hospital. Hospital? It's crowded around the lockers. So stay on your toes. Okay-. Why's she calling me? Kiddo, I'm a little tied up. Did chairman Moon hire you? Yeah, I'm hanging up. You know that lawsuit over side effects? We won that case, there's no side effect. Are you sure? I am! What is it?! Han went around to meet the clinical trial participants. What are you talking about? You knew, didn't you? That these 2 cases were related. What? Live performance will begin soon. Let's chat later! Is this $2?! What the hell are you doing?! What? What did you say? What the hell are you doing?! We missed him! He's gone, are you deaf?! Out of the way! He can't be far, find him! Find who? The one with ice box! Ice box, ice box. Shit! The car's not paid off yet! My baby... Get out! Get away! Dammit! Who the hell are you? Huh? Han Min-Jung? Are you okay? Drink this. So, are you and Kim Jung-hwan only ones involved? What about the blood? Oh yeah. You were in nursing school. I'm sure you had many ways to obtain it. And the suitcase? You wanted be seen on CCTV to throw us off. For an overnight trip, I thought it was too big. I was an idiot for not realizing it. What was the corpse for? Why did you want to buy it? Why exactly are you doing this for? You are... conning the entire nation! He died! Of Lomix side effects! The body was the only way to prove its side effects! What? Lomix's side effects? It was found during clinical trial, but Moon covered it up. I'm the defense attorney on the Lomix case. You think this makes sense? How can a drug with serious side effects get approved? Because it's effective. But it can also be poison to some. How would you know that? Lomix was... created by my dad. What? He disapproved Lomix's release. But Moon manipulated the report and fired him. I'm home! When he tried to go public... He'd never kill himself, and leave me. That bastard killed him... Accident Report Your accident report from 5 years ago. Isn't it a bit fishy? He hired you despite having a prior conviction, letting you off the hook after causing accident on first day. Wanna hear a funny story? 11 M6392 There's been a car accident. Yes, please hurry. Yes, I'm the driver. Then I had this thought. Rather than you causing the accident, you became his driver due to the accident. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. It all makes sense with a new view of Moon. For that, you save your mom, pay dad's debt, doing anything for money? But why didn't you kill Han? You're full of shit! I killed her, I did! I'm not here to play truth or dare. What's your real motive? Answer me. Should I tell Moon? That Han's alive, and you're innocent? Mobile Soup Kitchen All expired food has to be tossed. The homeless may eat them. What will you do to me? Everyone knows you're from Woosu. I'll go away. With the report. Ms. Han, please. Could you kill me? Empathetic towards your prey. Defy Moon, your family's at risk, or kill your lover. But you had a third option. Faking her death. With enough blood, anyone'd think of it as murder. With enough will, you can provide plenty of blood. Little bit, everyday. You pretend to be her killer, and get the attention of the media. My client... is innocent. Meanwhile, she buys a corpse of a clinical trial patient. Why? The report alone is hard to get Moon arrested. But if she walks into the court with the report and a corpse, we'd have a different story. It'd be the talk of town, and the case'd get a full investigation. If so, even someone as powerful as Moon would be hard to weasel out of it. Why do you think Moon hired me? He wanted me to find out if you really killed her or not. And even if I find out the truth, I wouldn't be able to say anything. Why? An attorney cannot testify against his client. Know what's even funnier? I have Han. What'd I do next? Chairman Moon. It's Byun Ho-sung, have you been well? What can I do for you? I got evidence that'll prove Kim's innocence. What should I do? Bring it to the court? Or should I come to you with it? Sure. I'll get back to you. Okay. Son of a bitch. Why' re you here? The thing is... What did... What did you do to me? Untie me. Right this minute! Don't talk, you'll get a jolt. Don't talk, I said. A dog shock collar is good at reducing barks. Trainers say it could even kill the dog. Thanks, I got to find out who Kim really is. I'm told you were extremely smart as a child. Drawing much attention and expectation while growing up. But the smartest thing in the world is money. I can buy 100s of you with it. - Son of a...! - Whoa! Are you mad? But you got paid! Shouldn't bite your owner out of anger. Whatever you found out, do not bark recklessly. Looks like her dad. Get the report and bring back her body. Right away, sir. Don't move. Needle might break, bro. Attorney Byun Ho-sung Testimony What is this? Since July 2014, I did drugs with following people... 6- Kang Min-bee 7. Byun Ho-sung Boss, what's this? Why's my name on this? You'll test positive with an urine test. Is this why you put me on Ha Yuri's case? For a young girl, her survival instinct is strong. Smart kid. Why? Afraid that I'd talk? Why not just kill me? Kill you? You're nothing. So, what will you do to me'? Could get you arrested, or start a smear campaign. Crushing you is not even a job. Han is not saying where the report is. Get it for us. Then you get your life back, even your lawyer license. You can start anew in the country. Let's go! What happened to Min-flung'? Taken... to Moon. Let go. Wait, just a moment. I'll call you if I need your help. I got fucked while trying to help you. He's got me by the balls too. So please calm down. We should've just fled, it's all my fault. It was a pipe dream to get Moon. Please save her. You're still a lawyer, you got more power than me. So do whatever... whatever necessary... and just save Min-jung. Do you... know where... the report is? You do. Let's help each other then. You get the girl, I get the report. O Kay? Do you know what this signifies? Okay, I was never ordered to kill her. I'll get tried as her murderer. Earlier today, District Court of Seoul accepted civic group's appeal to overturn Woosu Meclicafs verdict. Due to this announcement, Woosu's stock is plummeting. Yes, Mr. Yu. It's really crowded here. Tons of people. Kim hid the report file on his phone and left it at the service center. We'll retrieve it soon. #136 please. Look, look! Run after him! Out of the way! Stop right there! There, go down! Hurry! Subway arriving in 11 second Mr. Lawyer! GaP~su! Okay! Wait, just a minute. Lomix Side Effects Report May the best man win? Winning is justice, isn't it? You Okay? My Phone... Hello? What? Where? He's here. Who? Came back on your own feet? The report's in the phone. There's no copy. What do you want? Grant me 5 minutes to speak in private. What bothers me the most is, thinking that a mere file could shake me, that really gets me. Would anyone believe this when it goes public? Pest like you really troubles me. Then squashing people like me is the easiest way. But what I want to tell you is, I want to become your and Woosu Medical's lawyer. What? I know your deepest secr... I mean, confidential information. And if I'm on your payroll, everything that I know is protected under attorney-client privilege. And if you allow me to stand by you, our trust will be strengthened. I'm not a dumb man. Anyone who gets in your way, I'll squash them in court. I'll start with the Lomix case. How can I trust you? You already have dirt on me. Mom... So unfair... - My poor daughter. - Please calm down. At federal level, we can still win. Great work. Thank you. Good job everyone. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. Sure, let's check it out. Seoul prosecutor Jin Sun-mi. Afternoon, great work. What brings you? We need your testimony as an accessory to Kim's case. Sir, I'll take care of this, please head back. Sure. See you again. This way please. Mr. Moon. I'm his personal attorney. And Kim's murder case has no connection tous. Kim was an employee of Best Guard, and we simply used their service. Do you understand? If there's nothing else... Are you nuts? After investigating him, and then what? You got a smoking gun? Sounds like there really is something. Even you can't touch Moon. Do you think you alone can change things? If I can't, should I just give up? The world is... a fucked up place. Some things in life are impervious to change. If you cannot win, switch to the winning side. Do you mean it? Yes. I pity myself for looking up to you. You're a son of a bitch. Don't walk around pretending to be a lawyer. I'll round you all up no matter what. Mr- Byun! Yes, Mr. Yu. Great work today. Not at all, I was doing my job. A small gift from the chairman. He didn't have to... This is a limitless card. Have fun and report to work on Monday. Thank you. Wait! Mr. Yu? - I have a favor. - What is it? - Sure. - Thank you. Follow me. Let's bury the hatchet. Don't worry about money, order whatever you want. - Okay? - Yes, sir! Don't give up yet, we can still win. You must get better and stand up. How dare you! Why' re you here'? Don't even offer a weak settlement. We're not backing down. What is this? It's defamation suit. For causing loss of sales, and defaming our company image. Are you serious? We barely have enough for medical bills. $1 million for damages? Seriously?! This is Lomix sales report. Please read it thoroughly. I hope you recover soon. Is this necessary? Huh? You know they're in a bind. I'm not after their money, I'm sending a message. Making an example. Got anything else today? Heading to court? Why? Go file their suit at the courthouse? What? Do it yourself, I won't do it. Wait a minute. Listen asshole, have basic decency! Being smart doesn't make you above everyone. Be a human being before anything else. What's wrong with you? Prosecutor Jin Sun-min... - Yourjunior? - Yes, sir. Looks like she's digging around. Let's put an end to that case quickly. Don't worry too much about that trial. I shut Kim up in exchange for Han's release after sentencing. It keeps bothering me. I can come up with only one resolution. Which is? Making his confession come true. He said he buried pieces of her in a hill. Let's have you end this matter for good. Me? Then who? Me? You wanted to take care of anyone who got in my way. It's your chance to earn my trust. Chairman's lawyer came by and said he'll continue to pay. He said you won't get death penalty. Also... the body will surface soon. What did you just say? The body will surface soon. Byun Ho-sung, you fucker! Min-jung's alive! I didn't kill her! Get me the prosecutor! I didn't kill her! See it through till the end. This is Byun's doing. I understand, sir. Min-jung and I planned this. She's... alive. Where is... Ms. Han? Incheon Recovery Center. Clinical trial is still ongoing. Discard all clinical trial data. Right away. Don't move, needle might break. The rest is up to you. Wait... Mr. Byun, you look nervous. If you disappoint him, we'll stuff you in a suitcase too. What is that? Shred the data, and destroy the harddrives! Barricade the front door! Prosecution office! We got a search warrant! Byun! Get rid of her now! The prosecutor's here! Think this through! This is obstruction ofjustice! Get out of the way, assholes! What are you waiting for! Arrest them! Get everyone! Delete all CCTV footages and cut the power! - Data is priority. - Okay. - I'm on it. - Go. You did all this. Clean it up. Clinical trial records are shredded or destroyed. We searched for Han, but she's not here. Chairman. Do I have your undivided trust now? Good work. But must you go this far? How many lives do you think Lomix saved? If we can save 999, a life or two can be overlooked. I killed a person! I committed murder! Manslaughter for me, accessory for you. So what? Who'll get me? Prosecutor? They don't have the balls... IO get me! They can probably arrest you. Since your hands are dirty. Don't worry, you're safe. The report and Han are both gone. You made the right call. You're really drunk. Good day, everyone. In a phrase, how'd you describe me? Successful CEO! Successful CEO, sure. Handsome businessman! Exactly right. At this moment, that's what I am. But I wasn't always this successful. Innovators and challengers walk a lonely and hard road. But smiles of those we'd save at the end that journey... that's what kept me going. Please let me reinvestigate it! Moon hired Kim to kill Han in order to cover up Lomix's data! Have you ever seen a killer confess to his crimes? It's how it looks, or will you risk your job? Han Min-jung's alive! Han's suitcase was discovered. What? The defendant brutally murdered college student Han Min-jung, and instead of repenting for his crime, he continued to lie about the body's where abouts. The state requests death penalty. State rests. No... Defendant, any last words? As the defense attorney, I insist his innocence. We have a witness who'll prove this. Wait a minute! Look at the hand! Ms. Jin. It was hard getting here. Did I get here on time? This is from Mr. Byun. Please ID this body. Are you Han Min-flung'? Yes. I am Han Min-jung. What's going on here? Since murder never took place, all charges are dropped. The defendant is free to leave. I'll use the law. I understand. I'll continue the trial as her killer. I got a better way. One that'll lock up Moon for good. The body you guys bought, I have it. It's simple. You and I can continue the plan you started with her. Faking a murder. I'll do whatever it takes to win Moon's trust. I'll become his lawyer. This is Lomix sales report. Please read it thoroughly. You got plenty of work cut out for you. So don't be upset. Let's get going, okay? It's your show anyway. Come on, we got work to do! What should I do first? Buddy, are you in? Yes, I'll do it, I will! Stuff the suitcase with the corpse, and collect tons of blood. Just confess to prosecutor Jin. You'll receive the cue from your father. The body will surface soon. Your lawyer said to tell you. Min-jung and I planned this. She's... alive. Delete all CCTV footages and cut the power! Mr. Park, where are you? Good, You did all this. Clean it up. It's all me, asshole! What a damn mess! Woosu Medical and I believe that nothing is worth more than saving precious lives. But must you go this far? For a pill? Must you kill people to eliminate side effects? If we can save 999, a life or two can be overlooked. Please don't bark. If you bark, it's all over for us, okay? I know you want a payback. Bori! I killed a person! [committed murder! Manslaughter for me, and accessory for you. If this gets out, we're finished. So what? Who'll get me? Prosecutor don't have the balls. You made the right call. Listen, Woosu Medical's future is! Chairman! You have to leave. What is it? Mr. Moon, you're under arrest for accessory to murder, gross negligence of body, accessory to battery, etc. You bastard, think I'll rot inside? Let's see about that. Whether money wins or a man wins. - Hey! Stop! ' You Played me?! Listen to me! You had to treat me like trash for Moon to fall for it! Stop it! Please! You know that I like you. It all worked out. I'm sorry. Woosu Meclicafs Moon Ji-hoon was arrested by the prosecutor. He is currently undergoing trial for conducting illegal clinical trials. If proven guilty... I'll get you for this. Ms. Ju? Give me a call if you want to start anew in the country. You're all dolled up. Why are you here? My car key. This one's mine. I'm off. Woosu may sue you for breaking attorney-client privilege. I know. You may be disbarred. I'll find a way, there always is. If you become penniless, I'll buy you lunch. I'm off. Hey, the thing is... Yeah, what? Nah, let's talk later. What is it, tell me now. Remove that make-up. It doesn't suit you. Son of a bitch! Are you nuts?! You got a habit of hitting me! I've only hit someone twice, and both times were you! Why should I remove it? Why's that your business? Why should I do it for you?! Because it doesn't suit! Shut your goddamn mouth! ' Buying me lunch?! - Keep walking! - Eat lunch alone forever! - Shut the hell up! What are you doing? Were you waiting for me? Just because I quit, doesn't mean you should too. How do we make ends meet? Who knows, something'll come up. I've been thinking... How about private detective? P.l.? It'll be legalized soon, it's right for us. Right for us? So you want me to be Sherlock? Where do we go now? Where a case awaits? Okay! Let's go! To where a case awaits!
