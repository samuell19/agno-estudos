(INTO DAD’S WOODS) A forest is like the sea. You must be able to swim? Exactly. - Quersus? - Quer-c-us. And there? Falgus sylvatica. Don't... We're only guests, here. Only guests. 1st is Fanny! Well done! Kids! Hide! - He's a puke face. - Vermicelli poo. Kremer! I've seen your shitty banger! Come down! It's not the end of the world, Frederic. I've told you not to come. You've been fired. Think you're at a funfair? It's private land here! Take your gear and piss off, got it? Has he gone? I don't like him. Come down, Gina! Your feet like I showed you. Once again. How did you get up there? He thinks the forest's his, but it belongs to all of us. - Everything belongs to us! - Everything belongs to us. Get in! Quick, Dad! Go, go, go! Surprise delivery! Mum, I'm going to the tramp. - Mummy! - My poppet. Off you go. - Where shall we put this? - Over there. Why did you bring the kids? - I couldn't leave them alone. - You hate being alone. She'll be here soon. She mustn't see you here. She's left money for you. I'll get it. Would Madam like a taste? Does Madam like it? Jimmy! You know what? Take it all. Come on, off you go. Go! Madam. Mademoiselle. Tony, Nora! That's enough, now! I want to stay with you. You have to go home. I've got to work. - Sweetheart, please. - Let's go, Nora. I'll get the meal, don't be long! Give me the wrench. Check out the wildings! You won't say hello, looser? I don't talk to sucker cups. Can't you say cocksucker, like us? - We never use bad words. - Your dad isn't here. Say it, he won't hear you. You scorn us 'cause you speak classy? You live here, remember? Hands off my girls! Fuck off, old fart! - Want me to come down, jackass? - Let's scram! Did you enjoy the show? You saved my life, Dad! Don't hang out with them, Gina. I'm not hanging out with them. - What are you doing? - I'm cooking. It's delicious, love. Dad's gonna open a restaurant. Not with your mouth full, Nora. - Who is it? - Frederic. I want to see Jimmy! - He's not here, what do you want? - Puke face! Jimmy's been fired. He's been stealing firewood for the last two weeks. Can you prove it? I can't believe this! You've fired him and you scoff at us in our own home! No one's a thief here! Go away! I warn you, I've got my eyes on you! You were perfect, darl... "I got part of my package in kind." Remember what you said? Do you remember, Jimmy? Why did he fire you, Dad? Because I saved a cat. Could we change the subject? He can't fire you for saving a cat. Don't you believe me? I was pruning, as usual... What does "pruning" mean? It means looking after trees. - Yes and no. - Yes or no? No. Well, I was up in an ash tree, a Fraxinus. 82 feet high. Suddenly, on a branch, I saw... A cat. A half ruddy, half black cat. It couldn't climb down. No one knows how it got up so high. The cat was up there to pass on a message to me. Cutting a branch, it's amputating a tree. Torturing it, forever hurting it. I thought we pruned for the trees, but no, we do it for us. So I saved the cat and the cat saved me. He fired you 'cause you saved a cat. It's unfair. Could you please stop? Afterwards, I tried to explain what the cat had told me, but no one listened. Frederic doesn't care about trees. He doesn't care about cats! All he wants is money. I guess no one has ever seen a cat half ruddy, half black... It ran away. - What about you, love? - What? Do you want to listen to the cat? You've already told me. - It told me one last thing... - What? Eat before it gets cold! - We're on holiday! - A short holiday, Nora. We're on a short holiday! Look! You get to sit in front! He only got B minuses! Get in. Buckle up! Third gear. Mirror. Well done, son. - Scoot over, kiddo. - Dad... Go on, quick! Buckle up! What's wrong, Dad? I won't let them follow us. It's the holidays. They can't have it both ways. Who? You know who, Gina. Stop it! All clear, they've gone. - Want to drive, poppet? - Yes! Come up front, slowly. We don't want to have an accident. - I'm racing! - Careful! No, turn it gently! - Stop it! Stop! - I want to watch something. - Let me have it! - I'll turn it down. - No, turn it up! - OK, I'll turn it up. Drop it! - What about dinner? - Let's fix the machine first. - What's the next step? - Clean the crosspiece of the drum. Turn it down. Give it to me! Down! You're a liar! Stop zapping! - What are you doing?! - Dad! Dad! They've understood! No! I hate you! Tell me what's happened! - You get what I'm saying? - I didn't do it on purpose... - Why did you throw away the TV? - We don't need a TV. It's not good, for anyone. That's no reason for throwing it out of the window! - I'll buy a new one. - You'll buy a new one? With what money? Who got fired, here? I'll sort it out, don't worry. I am tired. I'll take care of everything. Come for a walk. - No, Dad, it's too late. - I want to go for a walk. Poppet? Sweetheart? - Want to watch the stars with Dad? - Yes. - What's the matter? - We're going to watch the stars. Why can't I come? Who said you couldn't? Gina, come and see the stars. - What about Mum? - She's sleeping. Come on. - What are we going to see? - The stars. - Will we see a rabbit? - Maybe. I like the night. Watch your step. Look over there! That's the evening star. Or Venus. At sunset, it's the first to shine. At dawn, the last to disappear. The shepherds could follow it for a long time. Exactly. Dad, I'm cold. We'll light a fire, OK? - It'll scare away the wild beasts. - Wild beasts? I'll get some wood. Stay here. I'll be right back. I'm afraid a boar would eat me. Nora, boars eat acorns, not children. Will Dad come back? Of course, he will. He won't leave us here. Stay close to me. Dad? Dad? Dad? Do what you like, I won't stay here. Dad told us to wait. Nora, we're leaving. Come on, get up! Gina, I'm tired. Carry me on your shoulders! You're a big girl. - We'll never find our way home. - Tony, stop scaring Nora. Gina? - Tony? - Mum? Mum? - Mum! - Nora? Gina? Nora, are you OK? Where does it hurt? Oh dear, you're frozen. Dad's looking for firewood. He's never come back! Poppet, put on your pyjamas. I'm coming. Are you totally mad, Gina? What went into your head? Should he have gone alone with the kids? No. Touch it. Where were you? Do you hear me, I'm talking to you! Where were you? Do you realize, Jimmy? The kids were alone in the woods! Mum, it's fine, I know the woods. You stay out of it! - They came back, right? - I'm going to leave you. That's what you want. You want me to leave you? If you leave me, I'll kill myself. I swear it, I'll kill myself. Daddy! You've caught a rabbit! Thank you. It's soft. I'm tired. Come on! We could eat it. Rabbit meat is delicious. Don't say that! It's so cute! Let's keep it! We could call it... Motus! Twiggy! "Twiggy" is a nice name, darling. I've no more clean trousers, Mum. Jimmy! - When will you fix the machine? - I'll do it today! You're staying home with the kids, today. All right? Don't worry! Put on your Bermuda shorts. It's not cold. Something's wrong? - What's happening, Mum? - Nothing. Is that clear? No going out. No wandering out. Understand? Don't worry, Mum. The rabbit won't go out! Nico! Was it you up on the roof? What roof? You said: "A quick shop and home". No, we want Mum to be happy. One is enough! Stop adding up! Take everything you want! Carrots for the rabbit! - Crisps! - Sweets! Ice creams! Let's go to the till. Come on, Nora. Dad, 200 euros is too much. Let's go to the till. Dad. Don't worry, I've got money. - Let's leave everything here. - They won't see me. Wait for me outside, kids. - We'll go through the woods. - Are you sure? Do as you're told! Come on, let's go. Why? Sir, excuse-me! Sir! Excuse-me! - Stop. - You can't see me, I'm invisible. You are invisible. Come with us. Please! - Come with us. - No. Calm down! Don't move! Are you their mother? Yes. Have you been waiting long? Not very long. Sorry, Mum. It's all my fault. Of course not, darling. It's my fault. I shouldn't have left you with him. Mrs Kremer? Hello. Can I see you in private? Yes. You have to speak up. You can't stay on your own. Don't you want to talk to someone? It's the first time... - What's wrong with him? - He's decompensating. Is it serious? It's a psychotic break, I think. He needs treatment. He's lost his job. It didn't help. But I'm sure that... Losing his job is not the problem. His problem is his illness. Here is a form to fill in and sign when patients can't consent. I know it's not easy. You must think of yourself, of your children. I can't do that to him. You're not doing it. He is putting you through this because he is ill. He'll be in safe hands, there. Only for a few days? Only a few days rest... We can't say. You'll give him back to me? Goodbye, Doctor. - Mum! - Are you OK, Mum? - Where's Dad? - He needs to rest for a few days. He hates hospitals! I can't stand Dad anymore! Gina, he's not well, he needs treatment. What's wrong with him? The doctor said he's decompensating. A psychotic break. - No! That’s rubbish! - No, it’s not! Mummy, drive fast. Like Dad. Wait for me here. Come in quietly. Don't touch anything. Got it? Go into the living room. Go on! Hello. I'm calling about my husband, Jimmy Kremer. He was admitted... on Monday. In that case, can I speak to the doctor in charge? Neither. But why? I still have the right to know how he is. You're not authorized. Alright. What am I supposed to do? I want to know if he's all right. For how long? For a long time. We were classmates. Goodbye, Sir. - We have to go home. - No, no, no! I told you: Do not touch anything! - Mum... - Nothing here is yours. Got it? Nothing here is ours. Got it? - So this isn't ours? - No. - I can't touch it? - Put that down! - I'm not allowed to? - Put it down! - Who do you think you are? - Who do I think I am? Who do you think you are? Everything scares you. The rich scare you. You're pathetic! Dad doesn't care! He's scared of nobody! Everything belongs to us! It smells good. You've cooked, how sweet. Is it Dad's sauce? Not exactly. It's just a sauce. I want to see Dad. - Are they nice to him? - Very nice. He's very happy. He even made his sauce. They all loved it. Really? They also played table tennis. He won! He's a great player. He even beat me, and I'm super good. - Have you spoken to Dad? - Yes. When? After you left, I think. Let's eat! - What's that napkin? - It's for you. It's all torn, poppet... My father would kill them all. He puts repellent. - Can I touch it? - No, you'll stress it. Otherwise, it won't heal. I need you to take me somewhere. Why should I do that? - Hold me tight. - I never do that. Hold me tight if you want me to start up. Hold on, please: we are trying to connect you. You are now connected. Security Control. Go ahead. What are you doing? My father's locked up there. Let's go. Gina, I've found another car! It's perfect. Here you are. Thank you. - Have a lovely day. - Same to you. - What are you doing? - Nothing wrong. Really? My colleague's still in hospital! Are you all nuts or is it just your father? - Hi, darlings. - Hi. Here you are. 10 euros, to help you buy a new TV. With Gina, we washed some cars at the supermarket. You want this money? - Hi mad Jimmy’s daughter. - My dad's not mad. We laughed, she’ll laugh too. Right, Gina? Your dad shopping stark naked. Like everybody else. - Look at his dick, there! - Sir, excuse-me! - Give me that! - Get it! Come with us, Sir. I'll invite you and your Mum to a private viewing. - I've got it. - Give me that! What are you doing? - It's my mobile! - It's her dad! Why did you delete it? She'd have sucked our balls for years to get this video back. - Grow up! - Piss off! Buster! Ass-kisser! Mum, what are you doing? The kids are asleep. Stop it! - Leave it on. - Mum, it's not funny. Dance with me! You're beautiful! My darling... - I'm fed up with this car! - You don't know how to do it. Dad will repair it when he's back. Shall we take the bus? Sorry, Madam, no visits are authorized for the moment. It's usual during the observation period. How long does the observation period last? - Usually 3 days. - 3 days? Here's the number of unit P5. No. I've spoken to them, they're not allowed to say anything. - Can you take that, at least? - I can't. Clean clothes for my husband. Your husband doesn't need any right now. Is he naked? Children under 15 can't visit. It's written here. Thank you. I can read. We won't ever see him again? Of course not! Gina! Gina! - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Gina! - Dad! Dad, we're here! - Dad! Come here! - Jimmy! - I want to give you a kiss! - Carole! - Jimmy! - Carole! Dad! - Mr Kremer. - Let go of him! - Let go of me! - Come with us, Mr Kremer. Open up! I want to see my husband! - I want to see the psychiatrist. - Sorry, Madam. He is busy. I want to sign a discharge form. I signed for him to come here. I'll sign to get him out. Got it? Madam, please. For him to be discharged, we need to make a diagnosis. - Madam! - Jimmy! Sorry, let us do our job. Madam, you can't stay here. Madam. Please. Children... The truth is, you had him locked up. We'll talk about it at home. I don't care! You had him locked up! What do you think? You think it's easy for me? Four tickets, please. Goodbye. - Are you all right? - We don't need help! Thanks. Mum's hurt herself because of you! Shall I put them back? - It's all Dad's fault! - No, stop! Still angry with me? Don't move. Do you think I'll be like Dad? What do you mean? Will I be as muscular? Because with no muscles, tattoos look ridiculous. I'm sure you'll be all muscle. Shall we test you? If you want to. No, no, no. - Wait. Start again. - It doesn't count. - Three... - Two, one. - I'm beating you flat out! - You're going strong! - I've won twice. - No. Could you take me somewhere? I'm not a taxi driver! - Is she going to die? - No way. Mums don't die before their kids. Get dressed! Leave the curtains drawn. I feel better in the dark. - What time is it? - Half past nine. I'll sleep a little longer. I'll finish at Valette's later. - You can't, it's obvious. - We need this job, Gina. - Put that away! - Just for today. - What if someone sees you? - Nobody will. You're stubborn, my girl. Tell me. Well, Valette's. Garage... front door... terrace... Don't touch this one. And the code: 21-0-6-#. - Repeat. - 21-0-6-#. Very good. Thanks, darling. Are you sure about this? Your house is stylish! - These are real, you know. - Real? Where do they come from? From China. My parents brought them back. They often travel there. - Your parents, what do they do? - Easy! My parents are in business... - Classy! - Yeah. - Why is there no photo with you? - Because I took them. - Obviously. - Of course. Will you show me your room? I don't know. Maybe. Hello. I've come to see Jimmy Kremer. Hello. I've come to see Jimmy Kremer. - Is it OK? - Not bad. Excuse me, Madam. I've come unannounced. Your butler let me in. You are always welcome, my dear. What is the reason for your visit? It's... It's about kissing you. - You don't have to stay. - No worries. Taxi Nico leaves the meter on. I've come to see Jimmy Kremer, unit P5. May I see your ID? I've left it at home, but I'm 18. I haven't seen him for 4 days, please. Sorry, Miss, I've been given orders. My mother's at work, she asked me to bring his clothes. - Please. - Look, you'll see him soon. - That way? - Let's try! Who are you? - Are you wearing my shoes? - No... Wait! Do you know where Jimmy Kremer is? Who are you? Who? His daughter. Dad! You're beautiful. - Are you on your own? Where's Mum? - She's at home. - She doesn't want to see me? - Don't say that. She's sprained her ankle. She can't walk. I love your mother. Here! They want me to sleep. I stay awake. Not a word to anybody, OK? Why are you here? Come on, Mr Kremer. Give it to me, it'll be OK. Give me the bag. You'd better leave, Miss. How did it go? Not so well... - You know what it is? - Where did you get them? - You stole them? You're crazy! - Thank you! - Gina! - Leave me alone! Are you all right, Gina? What are you doing? - You managed to do everything? - Don't worry. Thanks. - Seriously... - I needed to see you! - Why are you shouting? - I'm fine. You're ill. I can't leave you like that. - How did you know? - Gina came yesterday. How did she get in? They let her in and they let me out. I thought it would take longer to cure you. Why? You're not a doctor. Who's ill? - Daddy! - Dad! They've let you out because you're a great cook? Yes, they've released me for good cookery! Emergency... landing! It's the holidays. Guess what? We are going away! - Really? - Like everyone else. That's normal behaviour. Coming from a normal brain. - Darling, the car won't start. - I know how to start it, love! I'm working in 2 days. Let's go now! Just for 2 days. - It'll do us good. - My ankle... - I’ve come back to carry you. - Please! - Please, please... - Please, Mum! - Mum! - Please. Just touch my nose and we'll come back. I promise. Like this? We need a compass. We're going south. - I've got one! - You'll be the captain. - Really? - You'll guide us! You're travelling in your pyjamas? I'll get the rabbit! Tony, open the door! Come on! Go, go, go! - Great job, love. - Buckle up! - Dad, you're going too fast! - Don't worry, Nora. Dad's the best pilot! Isn't he, Gina? I like it when we go fast. Jimmy, Nora is scared. We are all going to die. What? We'll die together. It will be beautiful. - You're going to kill us! - Come on. Will you get naked again? - Shall we go on? - No. We're going home. What do they want? Mr Kremer? Do you know me? Mum, what's going on? Don't worry, poppet. - Stay where you are. - We'll go back to the hospital. No! No hospital. - Mum! - Don't hurt him! Good evening, Sir. - Was it you? The bitch? - Calm down. - Get back into the car! - Gently. Let go of him! Leave my father alone! Let go of him! You have no right! Calm down! Lie down slowly. Are you comfortable? Dad's right! You're a bitch! They are driving him mad! Don't talk to Mum like that! You don't understand, Gina... You don't understand! You've never been there! I know what to do. I can take care of him! I want to go home. Gina, come back! Gina! Fuck, Gina! I only took three. Come on. Are you OK? Slowly. Your bird has flown away... Grab the chair! Come on! Last cig for today. Let's walk a little. Nico! Give me a light! Gina! Hurry up! - Come on! - Done. Dad? - Dad. - Let me sleep. Dad! It's me. Gina. I'll get you out of here. Come on, get up. Come on. Gina, we have to leave. - Who is he? - Nico. He's a friend. Come on! Get up! - Don't leave... - I'm not leaving. You're coming with me. - Gina... - Please. I'm not so sure about the cat. What? No. I can't remember what it told me. - We'll never get him out. - We mustn't leave... Get up. Up! Get up! We mustn't leave... Gina! What do we do, now? I don't know. My Mum must be freaking out... I must go home. Now? No, not right away. Here. I'll light a fire to warm us up. - Wait, Nico! - I'll get some wood. I'll be back. Nico? Nico? You've come back. I told you I'd be right back. My dad will also come back. Yes. He will. When the fire dies down, you kiss me.
