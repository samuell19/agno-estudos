[laughs] Sure look good, little fella. How ’bout a little food, huh? -[murmuring] -[laughs] [Grandpa] Good. So how’s the latest patient? Aw, he’s ready. So when will you let him go? Tonight’s the night. Look at him feed up there. [both laugh] Yeah, here’s another one for our collection. Wish I could come. Well, why wouldn’t you? You haven’t missed one before. [sighs] Dad wouldn’t let me tonight. I know it. Oh, things aren’t going too well, huh? Well, just remember he only wants the best for you. He’s got a funny way of showing it. Ah, grown-ups are funny sometimes. I ought to know. I used to be one. [both laugh] Well, have fun tonight. Aw, come on. Things’ll look up. Chin up, my boy. [laughs] To the wonder of life, eh? [laughs] The wonder of life, Grandpa. [insects chirping] -Sorry I’m late. -It’s okay, darling. Sit down. Your dinner’s getting cold. Ah, it’s okay. I’m not that hungry. Sit down. It’s your favorite. I had an interesting phone call today from your school principal. Really? He said your grades have dropped again this term. Not as much as last term. That’s hardly an improvement. Well, it means I’m getting worse less quickly. And that makes it all right, does it? Look, as much as I’d love to stay and party with you guys, -I’ve gotta go out. -Kathy, finish your dinner, please. Look, I’m not gonna sit here and listen to another argument, okay? See, the fact is, Sam, you don’t try hard enough. Soon as the going gets a little tough, you just give up. And I’m not just talking about your schoolwork, everything. -I did my best. -You’ve got no idea what your best is. You’ve never stuck at anything -long enough to find out. -I do! It’s just-- Just nothing! Don’t you leave when I’m talking to you! Why can’t you be like other dads? The trouble is he wastes too much time at Dad’s. Well, at least Pops spends time with him. [scoffs] Doing what, teaching him how to speak pigeon or something? [laughs] Doesn’t matter. He encourages him. He has fun with him. Goes crazy with him. Oh, come on, Rick. You’re not being fair. Your father’s wonderful. Yeah, he’s a little unique. Aw, Beth. Okay, so he’s eccentric, maybe. Irresponsible, maybe. Having fun is not being irresponsible. Have you forgotten that? It is if you’re $100,000 in debt. What? What? I had a call from this lawyer. That’s how much Dad owes this guy’s clients, and he hasn’t got a cent to pay it back. Yeah, that’s it. Yeah. [laughs] Aw, keep away from traffic this time. -Come on. -[warbles] Ah, ah. All right, come on. Here we go. [laughs] Here we go. Hey, okay, my little friend. You’re safe now. Off you go, baby. That’s it. -Freedom! Oh. -[wings flap] -[chirps] -[laughs] Um, are you okay up there? Yeah, I’m ecstatic! Thanks for asking! -[grunting] -[squawking] [siren blares] Hi, Pops. [Mac squawks] How is he? Is he all right? It’s just a hairline fracture of the arm and a few scratches, but I want to keep him here for a couple days. Okay. Thank you. -[Grandpa groans] -Okay, Dad, you’re gonna be fine. Of course I am. Never felt better. It’s totally outrageous. So you just been jumping out of trees again, have you? Eh. [laughs] Um, Dad... we need to think about your future. My future? Yeah. Well, I-I hope to go to college, and then I want to backpack around Europe. [chuckles] Um, I’m serious. I mean, you can’t keep living the way you’re living now. Well, why not? I’ve done it for 70 years. Pops, listen. You’ve gotten yourself into quite a bit of trouble. What trouble? This trouble. Oh, that trouble. Well... don’t worry about it. It’s only about money. Money you don’t have. Yes, but look what I do have-- a world to fascinate me, a family to infuriate me. [grumbles] As I see it, I am a very rich man. Yeah, well, I hate to be a stickler for technicalities, but these people are taking you to court. What are you saying? Wh-What I’m saying is I’ve had to put your house on the market to repay the money you owe them. No. What? Well, you tell me. What else could I do? But-- But that’s my home. [Mac squawks] I spent my whole life there. So did you. It’s not just the money, Pops. We thought that you could do with some help now, too. Help with what? My work? Just the day-to-day stuff, to make it easier for you. Rest-home-type help. -Rest home?! -Don’t-- -I don’t want no rest! -"Rest home" sounds terrible. There are plenty of nice places out of the city, and you’re still totally independent. There. I’m sorry. No animals are allowed in this hospital. Thank you. [squawking] Help! [patient] Hey! [patient yelling] Hey! -Okay. -[glass breaking] -[orderlies jabbering] -Somebody get him! -[squawking] -[glass breaking] -Ow! -Got him! Got him! Over here! Over here! Put him in! -[squawking] -[thumping] [panting] -I believe this is yours. -[Rick] Mine? No. It’s Grandpa’s. Don’t worry, okay? We’ll work something out. [Mac cooing] Well, let him rest. We’ll see you tomorrow. I don’t want to go. Okay. Let him stay. Well, how’s he gonna get home? We’ll wait. Yeah. [coos] [coos] They can’t make him leave. I’ve gotta do something. -I’ve gotta help him. -[squawks] [Mac] We’ve got to help him. How could Dad sell it? It’s just... What did you just say? Okay, read my beak. I said, "We’ve got to help him," Sam. -You did. -Si. You just talked. Oh, well done, Sam. Oh, boy. -Oh, boy. -Uh-oh. He’s certainly--[squawks] What’s going on? The bird, it talks! Please. Come on, mate. It’s after midnight. It talks. I’m not kidding. Like a person. Say something. -[coos] -Go on. Say something. [wolf whistles] [chuckles] Well, you and the incredible talking bird, off to bed, mate. Come on. -He talked, Dad. I swear. -Yeah. Bed! [coos] -Who else knows? -Quiet. Only Grandpa, and that’s how it’s going to stay. But you could be on TV and stuff. When people saw you talk, you could make a fortune. [grumbles] Not me. My beak, she stays zipped. -Why not? -Forget it. They’d turn me into the freak with a beak. I’d be like Mr. Ed with feathers. It’d be a nightmare you could never imagine in your wildest-- -[Rick] Sam! -Get out of here. We’ll talk in the morning when everyone’s gone. It’s okay. We can talk now. I’ll be quiet. No! Buzz off, or I’ll bite you. -But I want to-- -[growling] Okay, I’m going. I’m going. Hallelujah.

No, nothing. Did you check them all? Every one, but it might have faded over the years. So what are we meant to do, dig under ’em all? Well, yes. Uh... [chuckles] He might have had a parrot with him. Well, no, I don’t think that’s so strange. -You know, that chubby kid. -No, no, no, no. He’s not friends with him anymore. Missing persons? It’s about my son. Well, they transferred me to you. I di-- [Grandpa] Hey, Rick! Yeah. Listen, they’re only gonna transfer me back again. Look, Rick! Rick! It’s the airline. You might like to hear what they have to say. Yes. -[grunts] -Dad. What? He is in the South Pacific. -[birds chirping] -[animals warbling] What are those noises? Aw, don’t worry. It’s only night trash. They just think they’re tough. -Mac... -What? aren’t you scared? [squawks] The only thing I’m scared of is being too scared to do what we have to do, right? [squawks] Right? [grunts] [grunting] Mac. Mac, help. Shh. Humans. [speaking native language] [laughs] -[squawks] -[wings flap] Okay. I’ll get this thing off. [grunting] Tomorrow morning?! I’m sorry, Mr. Girdis. It’s the first flight. -You’re not going anywhere. -What?! Excuse me. Can we discuss this like grown-ups? I can’t talk to him anymore. I might as well talk to the wall. What about another airline? We’re the only airline that goes to Coral Island. But there are three tickets still available. Do you want them? -We’ll take one. -Two. -Three! -And that’s final! Um, seated together... or separate? [chuckles] [grunting] Oh, well, come on. Put some backbone into it. [sighs] This is hopeless. It’ll take years. You know, the guy who buried this treasure used his bare hands. Will you shut up? I’m doing all the work. Just making conversation. Uh-oh. Hit the deck. It’s the hotel bozo. He’s coming this way. Get on. [Mac] Back to the wall. But quietly. You’re wearing sneakers, so sneak. Slow down. [squawks] See? We lost him. Now--Whoa. Wait. No, no. Wait. Hide. Wait. Hide. Thank you. -Oh, fine. -[gasps] -Oh, boy. -It’s him. It’s the museum weirdo. Oh, we’re dead. [Mac] Hold it.

We can stay here ’til the heat dies down and go back and dig again. Come on. This way. No, no. This way. Oh, smell that food. Table 24. Service! [Sam] I gotta eat. I can’t keep digging unless I eat. I am peckish myself. Do you think you can squeeze through -and get something? -What am I, room service? Okay. You stay here. I’ll give it a shot. -[metal bangs] -Quietly.

Quick! -Why didn’t you say something? -There! [singers vocalize] Situation under control. [dishes breaking] [squawking] [singer vocalizing] Something about that bird just isn’t right. [squawks] Come on. Get around the corner. Hurry. Move it. Move it. Move it. Ah, okay, here we go. Cracker and caviar. -It’s beluga. -Is this all you got? It was too risky. I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. -[sighs] -Just eat up, and quick. -Go. Go. Further along. -Why? Oh, I don’t want to debate this. Just go. Go, go, go. Ugh! Oh, what? [Mac] Uh, be careful. I think there’s a trapdoor... [grunts] [groans] ...up ahead. [chuckles] Go on. Take a break. You deserve it. There’s another trapdoor. Oh, the other side. Up here? Si. Hurry. Oh, full speed ahead.

Don’t do that. -[audience gasping] -This is humiliating. Uh, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. [whispering] Talk. U-Um, good evening, Homo erecti. I’d like to introduce you to my partner, Sam Girdis, ventriloquist extraordinaire. He’s great with people. [chuckles] That’s it. And I’m the real macaw. You like my outfit? I grew it myself. [squawks] [laughter] [whispering] That’s great. Keep going. Relax. I’m a parrot. I’ll wing it. [squawks] People always ask me, "Mac, what’s it like to be a bird?" Well, it’s no bed of roses, no, sirree. You gotta sleep standing up. [squawks] [laughter] Anyway, hey, this guy didn’t think I was funny. Of course he doesn’t. He’s got two girlfriends. -He’s too tired to laugh. -[laughter] Ah, but being a bird has its upside. We get to make fun of you idiots. -Mac. -All we have to do is say, "Hello, Polly," to one of you humans, and you say it back to us for an hour. You’re complete morons. -[Mac chuckles] -[applause] -What are you doing? -Performing here. Be nice. You’ll get us into trouble. Oh, no. They love it. Watch. In fact, you’re a bunch of brainless lemmings. -What are you? -[all] Brainless lemmings. Oh, let’s hear that again. What are you? [audience laughing] Yes. [cheering] [Mac] Thank you. Thank you. You’ve been too kind. You’ve been a great audience. I love you. Next stop, Vegas. Hey! Hey, not yet. I’m on a roll. My public-- Thank you. My public needs me. Thank you. Thank you.

Nigel St. John, general manager, the Grand. Sam Girdis, and this is Mac. [squawks] The cabaret legend. [laughs] I’d be delighted if you and, uh, Mac would do us the honor of performing again at dinner tomorrow night. [gasps] Yeah, thanks. [Mac chuckles] Struck out, bozo. [laughs] [Mac] Oh! Life, I love it! [squawks] Rum cake. I really love it. [laughs] Did you hear the audience laugh? You were fantastic. Ah, you were pretty good yourself, squirt. [squawks] It looked hairy there for a while, but you hung in when things go tough. for once in your life, huh, huh? Wish I could do it all the time. That’s why my Dad’s mad at me. Well, you can. Ah, this being strong, oh, hey, it’s all in the head. I’m still scared now, though. What about? [sighs] That psycho, he followed us here. Ah, forget about him. We’ll find the treasure, and be home while he’s still scratching his big, ugly head. [chuckles] Well, how do we dig under all those trees? Simple, one by one.

And did your parents give you a hard time? Oh, yeah, sure. But when I was taken away, I realized something. What? I missed them. Did you miss the forest, too? Not at first. Uh, but the funny thing is, the older I get, the more I do. I miss home. That doesn’t sound like you. I told Dad I hated it. Oh. Well, do you? I didn’t used to. Dad was fun. We did everything together. Oh. Well, what happened? I don’t know. Just stopped. Dad got really serious. Nothing to do with you, I suppose. W-Well, maybe a bit. Hmm? I just want him to like me again.

Ah. Thanks. [Mac] Breakfast? Get security to the gardens. Now! Hear that? Follow them. [Mac] Ah, look at all those holes. Yes, sir. Someone’s dug under every tree. It was him, Hagen. [Mac] Oh, you know what this means? Either he found the treasure, or it’s not here. -Oh, after all that time. -So that’s it. -It’s all over. -I can’t believe it. [squawks] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. -[gasps] -Sam. What an extraordinary surprise. -[groans] -Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Sam. Let me go, or I’ll call security. Well, then I’d have to tell them that you’re a runaway who isn’t here with his parents. I think it best if you cooperate. Where is it? I don’t know. You gotta believe me. [squawks] Please, I just want to go home. Home. [squawks] Home. Home is a long way away. Sam, if you don’t tell me what I wish to hear, things could get very upsetting for you. May I take your order? Just coffee. [squawks] And for that creature and yourself? -Uh, nothing. -[squawks] -[squawks] -You better tell the truth, Sam, for your own sake. [squawks] I don’t know. [squawking] It was there. It was there all the time. -How do we get down to it? -Ah, we dig. We can’t dig through the floor in the middle of a bunch of snooty people eating. We don’t dig down. We dig up. [sighs] Okay. Hold on tight. [squawking] [humming a tune] [scoffs] -[squawks] -Shh. [lock rattles] [computer beeping] Stand guard. I’ve got an idea. Oh, rock and roll. Ah, looks like a hotel cockpit. Oh.

[squawks] -I think we’re in luck. -[squawks] It’s not a treasure map, but it’s close enough. Ooh, where’s the reference. Can you see the restaurant? Um, it’s here, I think. [Mac] Okay. There’s a corridor leading, -uh, nowhere in particular. -Can we get into it? Uh, no. Perfect. There’s a manhole cover right outside. [Mac] Ah, there it is. Ah, okay. After you. Ah. Oh, and we’re-- [gasps] First step in. Ah, that’s the one. Okay. When does it go under the restaurant? Ah, just up ahead, I think. Think it’s safe? Oh, well, hang in there. I’ll check it out. [squawks] Too easy! So far, so good. Oh. Come on down. [yelps] [screams] Touchdown! -[gasps] -This boy’s hot. I ought to break your neck. No. [squawks] You ought to thank me. We’re right under the tree. Go. Start digging, partner. [laughs] How could they sell a plane ticket to a boy? He hasn’t even turned 16 yet. Eh, he say something? Please don’t start, either of you. If you hadn’t planted this ridiculous idea of treasure in his head, none of this would have happened. [chuckles] Listen to him. Still blaming everybody but himself. Look, Sam and I have our little tiffs, like any father, son, but that’s not the issue. Oh, is that it, huh? So what makes a child feel so unhappy that he runs hundreds of miles away from home without telling his parents? Is it because he’s just unhappy after a little family tiff? Is that it? Is that how you see it? Well, call me crazy, as you do, but I think you’re wrong. Ah, again, I’m wrong. He’s right, Rick. And what makes him feel so unhappy? Because somewhere along the way, his father lost his sense of joy, and life without joy isn’t life for anyone, especially a child. Flight 26 to Coral Island is now boarding.
