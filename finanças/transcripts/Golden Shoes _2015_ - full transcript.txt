[ crowd cheering ] ANNOUNCER: The ball is behind him. He bobbles it, and still controls it and scores. What a remarkable goal for Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world's best. So... who are we rooting for? The man is awesome, Mom, but Portugal is the best. I'll do anything to play like him, Mom. Well, you know, you got to learn to walk before you can jump. ANNOUNCER: ...still controls it and scores. You got to be real good if you want to be on a national team. You got to work real hard. And... you got to prove yourself to the coach so he gives you more play time. [ sighs ] I don't want to be a ball boy anymore, Mom. I want to play for the national team. Yeah?Mm-hmm. Is that what you really want?Mm-hmm. You feel it here? I feel it here. Well, you can be anything you want to be. We believe in you. Ah, come here. I love you too, peanut. Okay. Finish your sandwich. BOY: Goal! Whoo! Who scored? This guy Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world. Oh, my gosh, you should see it. Well, they're gonna show the instant replay right now-- No, no, no, no. I got this. Again? Oh, wow. Mom, see that? Man, that's how I'd want to score in a finals game. Wasn't that just amazing? Uh, yes. Wow!Amazing. I hope I don't get in trouble. You said you believed in me. [ chuckles ] Go get your ball. BOY: A new ball. [ both chuckle ] Finders keepers, losers weepers. All right, guys, go get ready. [ boys laugh ] We got a new ball. Hi, Mr. Granger. Well, if it isn't Chris the wannabe. Can I have my ball back, please? What ball is that? So, where's your dad? On some secret mission? Hi, Kathleen. Hey, Frank. Nice day, huh?Yeah, it's very. Have you watered your tulips today? Well, my work schedule's been interfering with my gardening. How's George? You know what this country needs is heroes at home, too. To lift up our spirits, to stand by those who have to stay home alone, right? Yeah, well, this is my hero right here. FRANK: Right. Did you find it, hmm? What'd you lose? Has Chris been naughty again? Well, you know, boys will be boys. Tell me about it. Ed and Donald do the same thing. They practice in the house and break things. But they made the team of course. Northern Stars. And, as you know, not an easy team to make. Yes, I do know. Your boys are very good. Ah, the best. Look, Kathleen, if you need a man's man around, you know, to keep him in line and to fix things around the house, do not hesitate, call me. Okay. Oh, uh, Frank? Yes, Kathleen? Could you take Christian to practice today? I've got to be at work again. I would love to. That'd be great. Thank you. I don't want to be in his car. And I don't like when he calls me Chris. I think you're being a little hard on him. Hi, this is Kathleen Larou. Yes, I do. The window guy's going to be be annoyed. He's never annoyed, honey. Ye-- [ whispers ] He's annoyed. Told you. Can you come by later this afternoon? Great. All right, we'll see you then. Thanks. All right. Hey. Peanut? I miss Dad. Oh, me, too, honey. When can he watch me play? Soon, honey. Soon. Portugal won because of Cristiano Ronaldo. Two goals! And I could have scored more, just like how I beat you at Xbox. What do you think, Chris? You think he's that good? Yeah, go on. [ whispers ] Ball boy. He uses both feet. That's why he's good. Plays on both wings, too. Doesn't run the wrong way. He's never missed a penalty kick. He can curve the ball from a dead position into both directions. Got a long way to go before you're that good, huh, kid? Mom said I can be anything if I want to. Mama's boy. [ laughs ] Mama's boy. [ boys laughing ] FRANK: Okay, kids, let's go play soccer. Hurry up, let's go. MAN: Come on, guys. Hustle up! You're late! Here's your ball, ball boy. Dominic! Hey! Tight on the cones, guys. Control! Nice. Good, good! Keep up the pace! Keep it up! [ grunts ] You got to be joking! Julian, this is not a nap session. Do you mind joining us? Bring it on. Call that a shot? [ laughs ] DOMINIC: Good! Bring it out! For our next game, I'm looking to change up our strategy. I just wish we could-- Yeah, make sure you're playing my sons then, okay? If we want to compete in the state championships, I have to change up the strategy, Frank. Yeah? Something is missing. [ blows whistle ] Josh, pass it right away! Well, Coach, maybe the passing is what's missing. Ah, I need a poacher.A what? A striker with instincts. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Chris, go get the balls, will you? Donald, sit this one out. I'm gonna let Christian have a go. Well, Chris has hardly been making it to practice, Coach. His father's in the military. He's got a working mom. I want to see if I can't place him in the team. All right.And it's my decision. It is your decision.Hey, Christian. Take Donald's place and impress me. Heads up, Frank. All right, here we go! BOY: Yeah, come on, Christian. Show 'em what what you got. DOMINIC: Form a triangle! Triangle! Tri-- Josh! That Josh is a lazy kid. [ grunting ] DOMINIC: Protect your goal! [ groans ] All right, come on. Time for bed. Lay down. You're awfully quiet today. Is everything all right? Huh? Practice a bore? Did you miss a chance to play? I played. You played? That's wonderful. Why didn't you tell me? But I didn't score. Oh, honey. That's okay. Dad always says, "Never quit and always try your best." "And a different day will bring its own blessing." That's right. Mom? Yes. Why do people hate? People who hate just haven't gotten rid of all the bad inside of them. Hey, what does Dad say when, uh-- when things aren't right? "Never give up, for it brings success, and that's the best revenge." That's right. Success is the best revenge. I miss Dad. Oh, honey. Me, too. Me, too. [ gunfire ] Stay heavy on the flank. Rogers!I got you. Keep it down.How can we keep it down? Our boys have no idea where we're at. Make sure we get that transmission working again. SOLDIER: Yes, sir. I am working on that. James, get those communications up! I got-- I got to make a decision and you can't argue with me. Now listen up! We're surrounded and our ammo's low. I can't slow you down and risk your lives.

All right, just let me lumber up. [ grunts ] That hurt. Okay. Almost ready. Hold your horses. I don't have all day!I'm almost done. Just let me stretch my hips. Okay. Here we go. And... [ farts ] [ groans ] Okay. Oh, oh, okay. All right. CHRISTIAN: Are you serious? Mmm.You're killing me. I can't help it. Chocolate is my weakness. Kind of like... kids who watch the Teletubbies. Does your mom know? You're not gonna tell, are you? If I score, I get a bar. You sound like my mom.Let me see them. [ laughs ] [ sighs ] Bellisima! You're killing me!You said that already. Okay. Let's get it on. Okay. See why they call me the goalie. Pretty intense and awesome. All the ladies love it. If the ladies count as my mom, but still, they love it. [ sighs ]All right! I'm ready. One bar for me. How do you expect to fly for the ball when you eat sweets like you drink water? Can you just hit the ball, please? [ dog barking ] Not again! Um... Yeah, I'm outta here with my bars. Oh, it's you again, is it? The kid that just loves to play football! I'm sorry, sir. Well, you should be sorry! Who gives you the right to disturb my afternoon nap, eh? Oh, no, just look at this mess. The lilacs, the tulips. Oh, not the pansies. And you just stand there as if everything's all right! I-- Oh, now he's got a sorry face on! I-- Well, that's just wonderful! Look, I love my plants! I like watering them! I like taking care of them! Well, at least the fuchsia has survived. [ sighs ] Look, I beg you, please, keep away from my plants! Especially the pansies. You get it? I'll make sure I never mess with your pansies and your tulips, and your... Fuchsia! Fuchsia! Sure. Them, too. Good-bye. Come on, Stars, pull yourselves! Fight back! See, you've got to get back.Josh! Get back! Keep it moving! Defense! Pull yourselves together! Pull yourselves! All the way in! All the way! Mark! Get that ball. Get that ball! Agh! [ cheering ] Lucky! Ah, they'll be fine. Are you kidding me? Josh, get back! Keep it ready. Come on, come on, come on, come on. [ grunts ] [ whistle blows ] Hey! [ shouts in native language ] He tripped my son. Kick him out. [ blows whistle ] DOMINIC: All right, guys, bring it in! Grab some bench. Listen up, guys. What happened to the triangle passing? Heads up, guys. Short passes, look for the breaks, and get into the forwards. And then we can score. We could tie this. And if we tie, we have a chance to be in the top two. You can either be my champions or you can be forgotten. What's it gonna be? What'll it be? Champions!There we go! Christian's got it. Who else? I do.I love it! I'm hungry. [ sighs ] What are we? ALL: Champions! I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you guys. What are we?Champions! Yes! Get out there and play some ball! But I'm still hungry.Oh, please.

Hey, that was great shot. You were just unlucky. You played like a champ. I agree. Hey, Kathleen, how you doing? I'm good, thanks. You ready? FRANK: Hey, should I get take-out? He gives me the creeps. Hey, Dominic. That's my neighbor. Army wife. Those Army wives, man. Lonely, end in divorce. It's that distance thing, you know? They just can't handle it.

Okay. I guess I got you, man. That should cool you down. Thank you.You're welcome. What? I want to show you something. MAN ON TV: It's not very often, but every now and then, a miracle happens in the smallest of towns. And it happened during a soccer game. His name is Christian Larou, and the child phenom may be just the type of player the US Youth National Team needs to make it to the World Cup. Larou plays for the Northern Stars in the city of Farmington Hills and his coach Dominic Klein tells us he couldn't come at a better time at this point when the country, his team, and his family needs him most. [ television turns off ] [ chuckles ] Now that was cool. Oh, don't you be sad. Be proud. I just-- just wish his father could see this. I mean, it-- it just means so much. You know what this really means? What? That behind every son is a strong mother. He needs you. Now you need to get strong enough and get out of this bed. [ ringing ] One of the most spectacular goals by perhaps one of the youngest players we've been privileged enough to have been graced with, his talent is instinctual, to say the least. What are you thinking, Margie? I don't know. Who knows? No stone unturned, right? Get me the person that shot that. Man. CHRISTIAN: Dear God. I want to say a prayer for my mom and dad, but I don't know what to say. Please, please hear my prayer. I miss them so much. It's okay if I am here. I'll be all right. Also, if you can help Frank, that'll be great. Thank you, God, for listening to me. Amen. My knights, you won because you are a team of fighters. Now, warriors never give up. So you are no longer my knights. You are now my warrior knights! Now, win this game for me, for you, for your city! For your family. Win us this game. Now, what are we? Warrior knights! What are we?!Warrior knights! All right, now get out there! Good luck! WADL reporting live. Northern Stars coming into this game as the underdogs. WAZA, very much the favorites, had a great season. Their defense is anchored by that big man, Brendon the Bull. BOY: Come on, come on, get it back! ANNOUNCER: Here's a WAZA player, gets loose on the left, but Julian makes a great save. Looked like Ted Howard as he rose up to take it in the corner. But it's still WAZA on the move cutting down the left hand side. Lovely move. Faked out a defender. Opportunities coming for WAZA. This one is deflected by a Northern Stars player out behind for a corner. Now number 7, Keenan, on the ball. But it's still WAZA. They're asking all the questions. Into the middle comes the ball. Willie's beaten. And a left-foot shot goes by the post again. But WAZA looked as if they're gonna get a goal in this game. Clearly the dominant team so far. Bringing the ball out over the halfway line and into the northern heart of the Northern Stars' defense. And the cross comes across the middle and the header is a goal! And Julian was a little slow to react and it puts WAZA up 1-0 in this important playoff game. And it's Brendon The Bull there... [ whistle blows ] ...with a terrible tackle... DOMINIC: What was that? ...using his physical presence. Awful tackle and a yellow card quite rightly there. Finally, we get a Northern Stars attack and the shot goes past the post, much to the dissatisfaction of the many Northern Stars supporters here. But Christian Larou now on the ball. Beats one man. Beats a second man. Left-foot shot and the equalizer. A goal for the Northern Stars! Yeah! It's 1-1. No wonder the coach is happy. And now it's Larou on the ball again. Lots of players in front of him. What can he do here? Oh, a little flick-over, a rainbow. Does the same thing again. [ camera clicking ] Got through a crowd of players and he gets a left foot shot! [ all cheer ] 2-1 to the Northern Stars! Absolutely incredible turn of events here. Whoo! Nice! Hey, good job. Nice. Oh! [ laughs ] Yeah!Oh, Julian! FRANK: Hey, Dominic. [ groans ] Wow. Oh, hi, kid. I was just-- I was tidying up. I'll get out of your way. Well, go to sleep and I'll see you tomorrow.

[ telephone rings ] FRANK: Hello? Hi, Frank? It's Kathleen. Hi. How you holding up? I am getting there. How is Christian? Fine. He's doing really well. Could I talk to him? Uh, Kathleen, with the game coming up and all the pressure he's under, it may affect him. Oh. Yeah. Uh... I suppose you're right. [ chuckles ] Well, would you just please tell him that-- that I love him and that I miss him very much. I want to talk to Mom. Was that Christian? Frank, is there something wrong? No, not at all. He's just playing with the kids. Never give up, for it brings success, and that's the best revenge. FRANK:Kathleen, take care now, baby. Okay, bye-bye. Wait, I-- [ clicks ] I can't believe after everything I've done for you that this is how you thank me. You want to be on the streets, alone? No. All right, go to the basement, Chris. My name is Christian, not Chris. What do you know about standing up for yourself, kid, huh? My dad read me this story--Basement. Mr. President. You should take a look at this. Father MIA. Mother in the hospital. And the boy? An only child. He's living with neighbors. He has no one, Mr. President. He has us. So this kid led his team to the finals. For the first time. The game is in two days. I want George Larou at that game. Can you hear me, Zulu Nine? Can you hear me? [ static hissing ] Can you hear me, Zulu Nine? Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Zulu Nine? Can you hear me? Nothing, sir. Those are our boys out there. Get me the president. All right. I know these aren't your faves. We're gonna give them another try today, okay? [ knock on door ] My name is Margie Epberg. I was sent by the president. The president? Ladies and gentlemen, I called this press conference this afternoon because I have a heartfelt story that must be shared with the American people. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I was informed of a young boy, a young American boy who lost his dad in the war. Later, he found out that his mother was rushed to the hospital as a result of a sudden accident. Yet, through sheer determination, this boy rose to his full potential and he led his team to the State Regional Finals for the very first time. We as Americans care for each other. Zero Charlie Seven approaching Dragonfly. PRESIDENT: Our freedoms and our liberty will never be lost and your government will adhere to that principle and protect it. Now, this boy has been without his parents. His mother, who is still bedridden, is unaware of her husband's fate. I called her this morning, as a matter of fact, to tell her that I will do everything in my power to find him. [ gunfire, explosions ] I am pleased to tell you I have good news. We found the father. He's alive and he's headed back home. [ clamoring ] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Loop, yes. People want to know what are the names? Who are these people? Do we have names? The soldier's name, Loop, is George Larou... [ laughs ]...father of Christian Larou, husband of Kathleen Larou. My husband's alive! You listen. You listen to me. You rise up like the proud mother you are, and by God, you walk to your family. You hear me? PRESIDENT: The soldier is George Larou. father of Christian Larou, husband of Kathleen Larou. Come on. [ clamoring ] Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen, I'm just here to say if this isn't a hero's story, if this isn't a story to inspire a nation, then I don't know what will. And now if you'll excuse me, I've got a soccer game to catch. [ reporters shouting ] [ doorknob rattles ] Hello? [ knocks on door ] Frank! Hello! ANNOUNCER: And finally, after this long season, the players are coming out for the final. The Northern Stars and DC United. ANNOUNCER: Looking across the lineup, though, I'm wondering, where is Christian Larou? ANNOUNCER #2: Only thing missing from this game is Christian Larou. CHRISTIAN: Frank! Frank! [ barks ] That is annoying! That is very annoying! Where are you going? [ barks ] Charlie, help! Help! Charlie, please help me![ barks ] [ "Star Spangled Banner" playing ] What do you want? CHRISTIAN: Help! Help! What do you want, boy?Charlie, help me! Please help me! You again? Why does it always happen to be you? Well, perhaps you can give me a good reason why I should help you, you who have been a most persistent nuisance! Get back, boy. Just get back! Get back, boy! Get right back! Out of the way! Where is he?He wasn't feeling well. I gave him some medication, but his fever would not budge. I waited, but, you know. Just my luck.What's that? Nothing. All right. Are you all right, boy? Did you get cut or anything like that? No. Thank you. You're welcome. What happened? Yeah. Never did like that son of a bitch. I'm late for my game. So I suppose you want somebody to take you there. Yeah. If you don't mind. All right, laddie. Come on then, let's go. Wow. Nice wheels. Thank you. Wait. Am I seeing soccer trophies? And you hate the game? [ sighs ] All right, all right. I'm busted. In my time, I was good. No, actually, I-- I was really good. Soccer was my entire life. And then, uh... one day, my life changed. I had an accident. I broke my legs and I broke my back. And in all those years when I should've been playing soccer at an international level... I was learning to walk again. So I-- I just-- I had to turn my back on soccer. You know, I-- I couldn't play anymore. I couldn't bear to watch it. And I was doing very, very well. Until one day, a rather annoying little boy next door started practicing. And I had to endure his irritating training sessions. And you know what happened? Damn it, once again, I fell in love with a beautiful game. Touching. No, really. Touching. The game! The game! Here we go. Here we go. FRANK: Go, go, go, go! DOMINIC: Bring it, bring it! Go, Will! Oh, man. [ crowd groans ]Help him out! [ groans ] DOMINIC: Attack the ball! [ whistle blows ] ANNOUNCER: Penalty against the Northern Stars. Come on, ref! ANNOUNCER: I don't fancy Julian's chances. He's looking nervous. [ blows whistle ] I'm done. [ sighs ] Ladies and gentlemen, Christian Larou is actually entering the stadium. Christian! Hey, buddy, I heard you were sick. Sorry I'm late. But I feel better. Well, I'm glad you're better, but we're down a goal. ANNOUNCER: The ball flying up into the Northern Stars region. [ crowd gasps ] Oh, no.What? My boots.What boots? The ones I play with. That's all right, we got extras. Here, play with these. You don't understand. I can't play with anything else. You're right. I don't understand. I can't play without them. I'm no good without my boots. Hey, listen to me. All my life I wanted to be a winner and I never got close. But you got me there. You got me here. I've seen you do magic out on that field. It's not because of your boots. It's because of you. It's because you play with heart. No one can take that away from you. I believe in you like you're one of my own. Now, put these shoes on and let's do this. ANNOUNCER: Christian Larou has entered the game. Can this raise the Northern Stars' spirits? Washington DC United still on the move. But the play's broken up by Willie. Nice ball forward to Christian. Christian is moving in the defense, a left-foot shot. Oh, it looked as if he had scored, but in fact, it's in the side netting. United are moving in again on Julian and the Stars' goal, but it's broken up. Northern Stars are in control of the the ball again! They've got it! Shoot! It's a goal!Yeah! ANNOUNCER: It's an incredible goal inside the left upright! Whoo! This is for you! ANNOUNCER: Tied game at this point! Christian Larou has done what he was expected to do! [ cheering ] Hey. George. Baby, I thought you were dead! Come on, only two minutes, my warriors! Here we go! ANNOUNCER: We're moving into the dying seconds of this game now. The national title is on the line. Northern Stars bringing the ball out now down the right-hand side. It's a lovely attack from the Northern Stars. Pass! Pass it to him! It's a goal! Yes! Goal!Yeah! [ cheering ] [ blows whistle ] That was awesome! That was awesome! Christian! ANNOUNCER: Northern Stars 2-1 in the lead in the final as we enter the last seconds of the game! Oh, my God, he did it! Oh, look at that! Oh, look at that. [ cheering ] One, two, three! Good boy. [ laughing, cheering ] ANNOUNCER: The Northern Stars have won the National Championship for the first time in their history. An incredible achievement. Thanks for the pass.You're cool, man. I still got your golden boots. You want them back? Just bring them sometime. [ all hooting ] Great game.Epic. Christian. Mom! Dad! Christian. I missed you so much, Dad. My boy. I love you so much. [ crying ] I love you. I love you so much. I love you. FRANK: Mom and Dad. Hold this, baby. He played quite a game, didn't he? [ groans ] I'll explain later. Welcome home.Thank you. Nice. Paid in full, Frank. And you're out. Hey, Golden Boy. Great game. Your son is an exceptional talent. He's one of the best I've ever seen.
