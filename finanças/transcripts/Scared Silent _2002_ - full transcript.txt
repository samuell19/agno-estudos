[ Siren wails ] [ Applause ] Man: Hey, people, what do you call it when a Minnesota gopher marries a badger? Second man: I don't know, what? Man: I don't know, either, but it's illegal in 12 states. [ Laughter ] I've never been happier to see two folks get married, even if Doug is from Wisconsin. [ Booing ] But all kidding aside, I just want to take off my hat to the toughest, fairest, most honest person I've ever had the pleasure to see get hitched. And, Doug, you're not bad either. We wish you both love and luck. And may you live happily ever after, Doug, where god always meant you to be -- in Minnesota.

Hawaiian honeymoon special. White beaches, blue water, surfing. What am I going to do with a surfboard? You can't fish off them. I don't know, you might love it. You don't want to see me in those flowery shorts, trust me. Man: I do. You don't get a vote, Harley. Besides, I don't think there'll be much time for surfing anyway. Hi. There he is. Come here, partner. How'd the morning go? Ah, busy. I ordered a couple more cases of the coffee. And you need to call that guy in stockwell about his invoice. You having lunch with Carole? Well, unless she forgets it's Wednesday, I am. Say hello. Okay, I will. Hey, Carole. Hey, Paul. Hey, Rick. Woman: Hey, Carole, how you doing? Hey. I swear he's grown since the wedding. In a week? I think you're licking too many stamps at the chicken plant. Don't listen to her. You are the biggest and the sweetest and the only good thing to come out of your mom's first marriage. What was his name again? Um, I don't believe I recall. Well, he's long gone now. And anyway, Brian's going to be Doug's son any day now. He filed the adoption papers with the state. I love Doug. God! Men! Can I pick them, or what? Rusty James, ninth grade. Hey, you don't have to be nasty. So you're going to work here in the mornings and the afternoons at your mom's? For now. It's kind of crazy with Doug starting a second business. But, you know, he feels really strongly about putting Brian through college. And it is kind of hard with a small town police chief's salary, so. Did I tell you I love Doug? I saw him first. "Then all of a sudden, "Libby jumped into the little cloud "and snuggled there like a cotton ball. "And the little cloud began to float into the starry sky. "'Where are you going,' shouted Otto. "'To dreamland,' said Libby. 'Good night.'" Doug: Remember that assault and battery I had where the lady punched her sister? You mean out on topper lake? Yeah, well, it turns out the lady who got hit, her husband's making her press charges because he hates his brother-in-law. Well, there's no war like a family war. Well, good news is, it's not my problem any more. The county's going to handle it. They got some new deputy in the sheriff's office. A guy named John mccrane. He's going to go talk to the husband, see if he can fix it. Good luck. The husband's an oil rigger. What do you think of those odds? [ Gasping ] I said, what do you think of those odds? Honey? Kath? Honey? Oh, my god, what happened? Are you okay? Baby, what happened, did you hurt yourself? Kathy, it's after 8:00. Sweetheart, I, um, I gave Brian his breakfast, and your mom's on her way over. I got to go, okay? You got to get up. Please, just tell me what's going on. It's nothing, just cramps. I'll be fine. [ Telephone rings ] Ellis county sheriff's office, Debbie caston speaking. Oh, hi, Deb, it's Kathy. Look, I know you're busy, but, um, ah, is the church covered dish next Sunday or the Sunday after? Sunday after. Oh, okay, well, that's all I was looking for. Oh, you know what, um, Doug was talking about this, um, new deputy that you have, John mccrane. And I was just wondering, um, does he happen to be the same guy that worked here in fremont about, I don't know, 13, 14 years ago? Thirteen years? Um, yeah, he would have been, um, a police officer then, not a sheriff's deputy. I don't know -- he's not here. He just called in from the high school, though. I can ask him when he gets back. Oh, no, no. I'll ask Doug when I see him. Um, I got to get back. Okay, bye. Bye. [ Dial tone ] Man: No wonder you're cheerleaders. Working on your studies? Are you? You love studying, I can tell. Want to show me a cheer? Come on, you can do it. Girl: Go, hawks go! One more time. One more time, come on, for good luck. Yeah! Hi, Carole. Hey. The worst thing about being a secretary in this place, by the time you type "chicken parts" 95 times a week, I wouldn't buy the little suckers on a bet. What's wrong? He's back. How do you know? I saw him. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He can find US, he can find US. We have to tell, Carole. No, no, he'll come after US. He said he would. We have to tell. We've talked about this. At least Doug -- we have to tell Doug. No, no, no, no, no. I saw him at the high school... Talking to the girls. Well, John mccrane -- he'd been coming to the football games, joking with the cheerleaders, saying it was his sworn duty as a fremont police officer to protect US from the high school boys. He'd stop by the drive-in on weekends, hang out. We all liked him. He was nice to US. We all called him John. Anyway... Two weeks after graduation... I was driving home one night. It was late. [ Siren wails ] He knew my car. He flashed his lights. He pulled me over. Hey, Kathy, how are you doing? Okay. I know it's kind of late, but there's something I want to show you back at the station. Why don't you follow me, okay? Yeah, all -- all right. I followed him. I don't know why. I mean, the police station was closed for the night, and I don't feel right being there. But he is a police officer. And it's the station we're at. Anyway, we go down these stairs, me first. Right down here. He says he has this new soda machine he wants to show me. And then -- no! What are you doing? Stop it! No! And I'm trying to get up and I'm trying to get away. I keep screaming, please don't! Stop! Stop it, no! But he keeps -- no, stop! Finally he stops. And I remember that he put his hand on his gun and he leaned over and he says, you know what'll happen if this gets out? And then he walks away, like it was nothing. It's like it was yesterday. I didn't know who to tell or where to go. I couldn't go to the police. He was the police. And finally you say to yourself, you know, if I leave it alone long enough, it's going to go away. It never does. I'm really glad you told me. You've been carrying this alone for 13 years. I'm not alone. Tell him, Carole. Tell him what happened to you. Carole. What for? All it does is tear you up all over again. You can tell Doug, he'll understand. Tell Doug -- I haven't even told Todd. I haven't even told my own mother. So... It's okay, don't tell me. Why don't you go home and you see if you can tell Todd. Because if you can't tell your husband, there's not much chance that you can stand up to this thing later on. We're out of beer. And do me a favor, get me bottles next time, will you, babe? Okay. Okay, shoot. What is it? Um... I was raped when I was 17. Ah, when you were in high school? It was on the night of graduation. Kathy put me to bed at the kellers' house because I, ah, I'd been drinking, was passing out, and I didn't want my parents to know. And, um... There was a... There was this police officer. Kathy told him to look in on me. And when I came to, he had me up against a wall... Raping me. I still had my graduation dress on. When it was done, he threw me down on the couch. And I could hear him in the bathroom cleaning up. A cop? Happy graduation. Please, use your schooling. Because if you tell anyone... I won't, I won't. Todd: Jeez, honey, are you sure? I mean, you said you'd been passed out. Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm sure. And this guy works down at the county sheriff's now? Mm-hmm. Well, it's not like he's always going to be here in town. And I hope to god he's grown up by now. I'm sure he has. But he raped me. And he should be shot for that. But that was 13 years ago, Carole. We don't have to tell anyone. He raped Kathy, too. Two weeks after me. Doug knows. Doug knows? We just took out a second mortgage, Carole. We have a kid -- we both have jobs. If we have to start dealing with this out in the open... Okay. All right, it's up to you. Whatever you want. Okay. Okay. I just... What if he finds out where I live? Where Claire goes to school? I'm just so scared. I can't do it. You remember after it happened I went to Kansas City to live with my dad. Mm-hmm. God, I wanted it to be over, all of it. Feeling guilty, ashamed, afraid to tell. All of it. One day I went into the bathroom and I looked in the mirror... I couldn't take it anymore. I took every pill in that cabinet. My dad found me half dead on the floor. That's what keeping it inside did to me. Is everything okay? Well, I made some calls. It turns out deputy mccrane moves around a lot. He's had 11 jobs in the last 18 years. And I called the chief where mccrane worked before he came to this town 13 years ago. I just mentioned that we have sexual misconduct allegations against one of his former officers. Without missing a beat, he says, "uh, you're talking about John mccrane." Thirteen years ago? And he knows in a second? Yeah, mccrane was there six months, there's a complaint against him, sexual misconduct. They reprimand him. Four months later, there's another complaint, different woman. Oh, my god. Yeah, he's in his probation year, so they let him go without cause. Do we know who these women are? Yeah, they're in bonner Springs, about 30 miles. Well, can we talk to them? I can. If you two go, the defense can claim collaboration between complainants later. Now, I'll go find them. But are we doing this? Because I'll keep going until I drop. But there is no halfway, there can't be. I'm doing it. Okay. [ Horn honks ] Hey. Hey. So Doug talked to the women in bonner Springs? Yeah, he found two willing to talk. And they were raped by mccrane? So they're going to join in with US, right? They don't want to go public. Great. So it's just US? Well, there's a problem with US, too. What? Doug found out we're outside the statute. What does that mean? Well, the statute of limitations is nine years on rape. We were raped 13 years ago. So were the other two women. Doug doesn't even know if we can put him in jail. I'm sorry, Carole. Doug: They both took polygraphs and tested truthful. The results are in this file. Kathy and miss bakelin are from fremont. I've listed other leads in bonner Springs. It's all in the file. The pattern of behavior is very clear, Owen. What a horrible thing. I'm real sorry, Mrs. Clifson. Even if there's a problem with the time lag, I'm thinking there's more than enough cause to dig into his personnel file, call a review board, and put his feet to the fire. Time lag? He's got a family. Gosh, all four of these incidents occurred well over 10 years ago. And the statute runs out at nine, I know. But, Owen. Exactly what is it you want me to do here, chief? Well, first of all, investigate the son of a bitch. We know for a fact he's still hanging around the high school. Well, I have a lot of deputies patrolling the high school. You know, I have to tell you, I have a hard time imagining that John mccrane's anything like the man who did these things 13 years ago? I assure you he's the man. I mean, I was the chief deputy before you were a cub scout, Doug. You've got feeling for the men you put in harm's way. John mccrane's a church Deacon, for heaven's sake. With all due respect, I've got four victims who -- who will what, prosecute? You can't. Drag him through the mud? Yeah, but before I take a good man -- he's a rapist. Alleged. Now, um, chief clifson, you've got yourself a pretty new wife, a good job, a new security company, a little double dipping. You're on a roll. Do you really want to hurt this man's family, stir up all this turmoil? I mean, what's best? We want him punished. And you either put someone on this case right now, or I'm going to channel 5 and tell them everything I know. Okay, here you go. Six dollars. Okay. Thanks. Oh, here's your receipt. Thank you. Hello. Can I help you? Mrs. Clifson? Yeah. Are you the person who made the complaint in Ellis county? I did. I'm whit Colby, Minnesota bureau of criminal investigation. The sheriff asked US to look into your allegation. We'll see what we can do. Is this a good time? Yeah. It's a real good time. Man: Will you take this call on line 3? Woman: I'll get it. Shut the door. So the fremont chief of police and his wife showed up here yesterday with this. Some statement saying that you diddled a couple of girls about 13 years ago. Assaulted them, while on duty. Well? Well. I know I sowed some wild oats back then, but... It must have sprouted some weeds. So...what, cop groupies? Yeah, I would think so, sir. To tell you the truth, I get that a lot. Yeah. Hell... Don't we all? This chief of police, clifson, he's the guy who started that rent-a-cop business over in fremont. Maybe it's just me, but I always took that as a real slap in the face. It's like telling the rest of US we don't do our job. You better believe a lot of boys resent that. Anyway, he's turned up here and he's raising a fuss. I'm real sorry for any trouble that this is causing. Well, I'm running an investigation, that's the law, and I believe in the law. But I'll tell you this, I also believe in the young men who have to go out on those streets and enforce the law. Too bad we can't say the same about Doug clifson, hmm? Yes, sir. Chief, feel free to keep that copy. We've got a possible trailer truck theft out on the interstate. Ah, we're a little confused here, is the whole of your investigation? That's it. Oh, but there's a lot left out. Well, ma'am, I'm afraid that that's as far as the law will let me go. Call me if you've got any questions. Wait. Um, what about the other two women besides Carole and me, did you interview them? No. But they were raped, too. Well, unfortunately there's no physical evidence of sexual assault. Of course not, it all happened 13 years ago. Which puts all four women outside the statute. Plus the other two won't press charges. And mccrane's read your file and he denies having sex -- wait a second. Mccrane read the file? Yeah, sheriff Bradley gave him a copy. Since when does a rape suspect have a right to see his file? Sheriff Bradley never felt that the file was official to start with. I really got to get going. He knows who we are now, phone numbers and addresses. How's he get the file, whit? Now he knows every accusation date, he could write his own story. How is that right, explain it to me? Nobody's going to let this guy go down without a fight, he's a career cop. He's a cop raping women. Does that bci badge you're wearing mean nothing to you? I don't have an easy job here, chief. I'm one investigator covering four counties. And I don't sunburn as easy as everyone else. But you said you were going to help. You said we'll see what we can do. There's nothing more I can do. You got someone assaulted inside the statute, sure, then I'm in the hunt. Otherwise my hands are tied. You want some coffee? I guess one more won't hurt. Busy morning? Yeah, Doug and I met with the bci man today. And? Well, he's investigating. I guess they put mccrane on some kind of leave in the meantime, paid. Great, now he's paid to cruise the schoolyard. Yeah. And... And they, ah... They what? Spit it out. They showed mccrane our statements. Carole? Carole, what are you doing? Hey, come on. At least he's not on duty. You live in town, Kathy, you got neighbors. Look where I live. Todd will take Claire to school one morning, I'll be alone, he'll show up, no one will know. Hey, you remember fourth grade when Lyle parks pulled down the top of your swimsuit? We rolled his bike into the river. This isn't fourth grade. Woman: What are you looking at? Nothing. I've been noticing the same nothing driving by three, four times a day, slow. They want you to see. I know. Those kind of men, they want to scare you. Well, I'm not scared of them. Hey, want some more milk? No? And they're not allowed in this restaurant. You and Brian, I'll protect you, baby, I swear. You take your 130-pound arthritic frame and knock them cross-eyed. I'll feel much better. [ Door opens ] He flew the Coop. Mccrane resigned here in Ellis county. To go where? Right back where he came from before he came here. Lang county? They hired John mccrane as deputy? Yup. "Sheriff Owen Bradley confirmed early this morning "that mccrane's resignation from Ellis county "had nothing to do with the reported investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by the deputy." My guess is mccrane must have called in a favor. "'Our investigation is over,' Bradley said. There is no crime, it's a non-issue." But they have sworn statements. These women took lie detector tests. It doesn't matter. The brotherhood's making a stand. Well, at least he's further away. Yeah, 40 miles. There's got to be someone. I mean, Colby said if we find someone within the statute he's in the hunt. I mean, what if we put an ad in the paper? Wrote a letter? What, looking for other victims? Yeah. No, it's a hornet's nest. Oh, god. We've come this far. We could spell out the charges in the sworn statements. Hell yeah. I'll challenge the son of a bitch to take a polygra. Yeah. Okay. Let's write a letter, I'll sign it. I'll sign it, too. No way, I'm not exposing you. John mccrane already knows it's me, he's read the file. No. Well, if I don't come forward, ■■ how are we going to get anyone else to? I don't want to hide anymore, Doug. Hey, Kath. Oh, morning, Marty. Is Doug around? Well, he had a court appearance this morning. Is there something I can help you with? Ah, yeah. Kathy: Well, the coffee will only take about a second. Ah, none for me. I'm just here on business. Okay, well what can I do for you? Wait a second, Marty. You can't do this. I can according to my contract. But you need this service. You came to US, as a friend. What am I supposed to do? A deputy comes to my office. Wait a second, what deputy? Who the hell knows his name, I never saw him before. He says, "you're going to have a hard time getting backup here. "We don't trust Doug anymore. "Doug's been writing letters in the paper, "talking about all the victims of a supposed bad cop. Doug's a loose Cannon," he's this, he's that. You stand up to them. I've got three motels on the interstate, Kathy. I need the deputies. They're squeezing you to hurt US. Please don't let them. The cops take care of their own. Doug should know that better than anybody. If you and Doug want to make trouble, fine. I can't afford it. Skip, eating pizza again? Hey, John, I wouldn't be talking. Tommy? Hi, John. Your wife have that baby yet? No, still waiting -- kid's going to be huge. Sheriff? Hey, John. You want to see me? Shot this bull with the governor last winter. I should say for the governor. Guy couldn't hit a silo with a pea shooter. I'm impressed, ed. You're hobnobbing with the governor. Well, not exactly that. The governor hobnobs with me. You seen this? Yes, sir. Buddy of mine mailed me a copy. I pulled him out of the line of fire six years ago. He wanted to give me a head's up. That was the hostage incident in Henderson? Yes, sir. I remember that. You maybe saved his life. He thought so. Two of the complainants have come forward, age 17 at the time of the assault, alleged forcible rape by an on-duty armed officer of the law. Listen to this. "I make a public offer of $5,000 to Mr. John mccrane "if he passes a polygraph test administered by an independent expert." Boy, this chief clifson, he's not exactly a fan of yours, is he? Well, the chief doesn't have too many fans himself, sir. Jelly bean? No, thanks. I'll tell you why I hired you. A good lawman is like god's gift to civilization. You do the right thing, word spreads. You know Jack Potter? Potter? Used to head the union. May run for Attorney General. Well, he called me about you before that trouble started over in Ellis county. He wondered if I might take you on here. I said, you bet. John mccrane's a winner. And hell, this business is about building points, you know what I mean? Whatever I can do to help you stay in office, I'm ready. I'm just sorry that you got to go through all this mess. I know what it's like out there. Whatever it takes. That's why I want you to take a polygraph test. This police chief is offering you $5,000 to pass a polygraph test. Hell, take the damn thing. Nothing to these allegations, right? No, sir. I never had sex with any of these women. Not then, not ever. Well, then let's take this rogue cop up on this challenge and put an end to this thing right here and now. Besides, it'll be the easiest $5,000 you'll ever make. I guess it would. I'll let you take me out to lunch. In Miami. Hey. What are you doing here? I thought Brian had a fever. Oh, well, it's down a degree. He's with mom. Listen, I just came here to get your signature so I can get this in the mail. Oh, my god, the adoption application. Yeah, I found it on your dresser. Okay, I'll take care of it. Well, it's due in St. Paul tomorrow. Okay, well, then if I mail it tonight or if I mail it tomorrow it's still going to be late, right? Late's not the goal here, Doug. Okay, well, this is kind of important. Oh, more important than Brian? Okay, Kathy, I just had to let Rick and Paul go. I'm writing their severance checks right now, we're going to be lucky if they don't bounce. I see, okay, well, I'm really sorry, because if this is getting too much for you, then why don't you just walk away? Because I don't really think you wanted to fight mccrane anyway. Okay, don't do this, Kathy, because I never said that. [ Telephone ringing ] Right, I never said that. Clifson security, this is Kathy speaking. Yeah. Yes. No, that would be fine. No, I understand. Well, I'll give you directions. Can you just hold the line please? It's a woman named Camille. She said she read our letter in the paper. She wants to come to our house tonight. I have dyslexia real bad. But a friend told me about your letter and so I stumbled through it at least 10 times. And I said, lord, that's me they're talking about. I know him from the truck stop, I wait tables. He comes in for coffee with his boys. He's nice to me, I'm nice to him back. Hey, give me that. He likes to joke. They all do. They got important jobs. Ah, she broke my back. Oh. Oh, Camille, you're an Amazon woman. I'm just trying to be supportive, you know? Feel that. Why? It's okay, work that over. That? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. You give a hell of a back rub, you know that? Yeah, I used to do that for my ex. I said to him, you should get your wife to give you a back rub. Maybe two nights later, he stops by my house -- I live alone, outside town. In his uniform, and, uh... He's there for his massage, he says, and I'm like, something's wrong. I want to say to him, "no, no, you go home to your wife," but he's so big, and I don't like guns. And I'm getting more scared every minute. He takes his shirt off and he lays on my bed and then he turns over, his pants are open, and he's holding it. And he pulls my head down and he makes me do it. I mean, I do it because I have to, you know. And... He has his gun. Camille... I want you to know that we believe you, and we're so sorry. Yeah. Okay. Doug: Now, this is kind of important. As best as you can remember, when was it that mccrane raped you? How long ago? Yeah. Um... Eight months. Okay, well, then you know what? We have a chance to bring this man to justice. Now, it's not going to be easy, but mccrane raped you inside the statute. Inside the -- you can't charge him of a crime like this if it happened more than nine years ago. I was raped 13 years ago. Doug: But if you would make a sworn statement and testify in court -- oh. Oh, no. In court? No, I can't do that. I just came here to give you a cheer, you know, for what you've been doing. Thank you so much. I got to get going. Oh... Uh, how old is he? He's 4. Oh. Mine's 18. He used to like stuffed animals like that. And then he decided he wanted to go off and live with his father. Camille. I think you came here for more than just support. I'm a nice person, I really am. I got three cats, I got a job. If I lose my job, then I lose my house, then I don't have money to travel to see my son, and you're asking me to come forward alone. No, not alone. I'll be there. In court? Right behind you. Yeah, but you can't -- can't speak, but I can stand. And so will another victim. And we'll be with you the whole time, all the way. I'll put an armed guard outside your house if I have to. You'd be speaking for all of US who can't, Camille. I mean, a man like John mccrane, he depends on US to stay silent. What you'd be doing is so important in helping so many people. And if you wanted him to know, the person who would be proudest of you is your son. Whit: This victim, is there any physical proof of rape? He didn't beat her up, but he forced her. No scratches, scars. John mccrane carries a gun. He forced her to do what she didn't want to do. That's sexual assault, that's rape. It is, but it's harder to prove. We get in court, it's her word against his. You said if we found someone inside the statute that you were in the hunt. Camille fenton is inside the statute, way inside. All right. Got this woman's number? Yeah. Where does she work? At a truck stop near clarksville. Where did this rape supposedly take place? At her home, a couple miles from her work. In lang county? Yeah. What's wrong? That's not my county, Mrs. Clifson. But the bci has jurisdiction anywhere in the state. Yes, but we're all assigned counties, just like any other agency. I'm on a leash. You're going to have to take this matter to lang county. Lang county? John mccrane works in lang county, in the sheriff's office. How fair are they going to be? I'm sorry, Mrs. Clifson. This is a lang county matter. The law is the law. Camille, honey, there's no smoking in here. I mean, you could go outside. There'd just be more deputies out there, though. This place is cop-o-rama. Kathy ever tell you how she ended up with a police officer? No. But I was wondering. I mean, after being -- yeah, well, my first marriage... Well, it had ended. The guy was like, "you mean, if I'm married, I can't date anymore?" Anyway, I got talked into this church singles thing and, um... And there was Doug, you know. And he walked over to me with this glass of punch. He wasn't in uniform or anything. And we got to talking and... He asked to see a picture of Brian. When was the last time a man asked to see a picture of your kid? Yeah, I mean, I'd given up. I thought men like Doug, they only existed in the movies, you know, but... There he was. Your wife and her girlfriend, those two incidents happened too long ago. You know that, chief. Yes, sir, I do, but they'll testify to a pattern of behavior. On its own, that's good enough reason to investigate. And this Camille fenton, the one within the statute, how is it she came forward? She saw the letter in the paper. Then she came straight to you? Yes. Be better if she came forward on her own. Who's she going to go to, bill? She was raped by a deputy sheriff. That's her story. Jill, will you send in the women, please? Jill: Yes, sir. Well, you know, there's clearly grounds here. I'm going to assign dick Carter to investigate. Dick Carter? Yeah. He's bci, right? Yeah. Well, now, don't these guys work out of the same office here in lang county? Because if they work together every day, bill, I'm just wondering how impartial they're going to be. Excuse me? If there's a possible conflict of interest -- number one, dick Carter is a top-flight agent of the bureau and the closest thing we've got to the FBI. Number two, even if it weren't the legally prescribed remedy in this matter, I'd still assign dick Carter. Why? Just to remind you, chief, because I can. It's my forest. You come from Ellis county. I talk to the Ellis county authorities every day. It's our strongest weapon against the bad guys, communication. Lawmen stick together. Yes, sir, they do. You either trust lawmen, or you give way to the lawless. Now, according to Ellis county, that's not your theory, chief. But it's mine. [ Knock on door ] Jill: The ladies are here, sir. Who wrote this statement? I did. Your name? Camille fenton. Miss fenton, these are serious charges. Are you absolutely sure about these accusations? Yes, sir. Phone number? 555-0199. Thank you. That's all. [ Clears throat ] Goodbye. Deputy mccrane. Hey, dick. You're looking pretty official this morning. Did they tell you that I'm assigned to look into these sexual misconduct allegations against you? I figured. Yeah. Well, I'm going to do my job, John. It'll probably end up in front of a grand jury. So I just want you to know up front that, uh... I'm doing the drill. I wouldn't expect anything less. I didn't rape those women, dick. None of them. Okay. John, are there any other women I should be talking to? Man: Hey, Lynn, you see the score? Oh, you so owe me five bucks, that was a terrible game. They couldn't hit free throws, you lucked out! [ Knock on window ] You're the only female officer in the department, is that right? [ Laughs ] Yeah, dick, you know that. This is for the record. Oh, okay, yes, I am the only uniform woman deputy, that's right. How long now? Four years. Did you know John mccrane the first time he worked in lang county? Mm-hmm, yes. [ Clears throat ] And you work with him now? I am. In all the time you've known him... Did you ever hear of any sexual misconduct on his part? No. [ Sighs ] I understand you talked to dick Carter. Yeah. Wasn't anything. That's what I heard. You know, I've been putting up with polygraphs, with rumors, all the bull. You're a breath of fresh air, partner. Thanks for watching my back, okay? Yeah. Like I watch yours. Yeah, sure. Do you want me to drop by tonight, go over last week's case files? I'm not going to be home tonight. I'm just kidding. [ Chuckling ] Kathy: They're coming from prairie view? Camille: That's outside ark city, right? I think that's what Doug said. Okay, here they are. Hi, Lynn, I'm Kathy. This is Carole and Camille. Camille. Thanks for coming. [ Sigh ] Yeah. Lynn: His first day in the department, he stopped me on the street and he rolled his window down and he said, "hey, I love a woman in uniform." So, I guess I should have known then. Except he's an officer. Never crosses your mind. About a year ago, he shows up at my house out on 21, and it was early in the morning, and, um, I was just stunned to see him standing outside my door like that. Good morning. Hi. Brought home those training files. You want to go over them? Cup of coffee? Well, I'm not dressed yet. Why don't you just bring them into work? Don't just leave me standing here. You're hurting my feelings. Open the door. This is pretty unprofessional, deputy. Okay, okay. Next thing I know, he's got two hands behind my head and he's pulling me down on him. And then I did it. And I know I shouldn't have. But I felt like, if I didn't...I... I'm the only woman on the force, and I have to be one of the guys to get along. I'm alone in a patrol car every day and this guy's my backup. And for me, this thing with mccrane, it's not the first time in my life. When I was 8, there was an older kid in my neighborhood and he used to hit me, and he... It was the same thing, I never told anyone, I just kept going. That's what we all did. And then I saw your letter. But the sheriff and all the deputies and all those people who've been my friends, they're so mad at all of you, and I knew that if I spoke up, all that anger was going to come down on me, too. And my career and my... Reputation... And my life would be over. But here you are. Yeah. I, um... I thought I was the only one. And... I said to myself, "he's doing this to other women, "he's not going to stop, and if I don't say anything, he's going to get away with it." Then you know what? How could I keep wearing my badge? Kathy: Well, I found this newspaper article about this class action. Ah, Liberty bell insurance, sexual harassment. That's exactly right. Thanks. And, well... We don't have much money. Well, that's okay. The way this works is, if we agree I ought to do this, then I'd work on a contingency basis, and the only thing you risk is some expenses. Oh. Yeah. That's really good. 'Cause there's only the four of US, sir. I'll tell you what, you call me Scott, I'll call you Kathy, and "sir" we'll save for the first cop who's trying to give US a traffic ticket. Okay? Okay. Kathy, I went through all the notes that you faxed me, and I guess I only have one question. Do you know what you're in for? Because whoever gets on that stand is going to have to tell every intimate detail, including the color and texture of his semen. You'll be called names, you may be shunned by your friends. It may take forever. You'll fight with your husbands, your kids, yourselves. Sleeplessness, depression -- are you ready for that? All four of you? Well, Scott... That's old hat for US now. Did you feel that they were being truthful? Man: Absolutely, there's no question. Did you feel they were hiding anything? Camille: It was about then that he unzipped his pants and pulled out his penis and forced my head down. I went ahead and did it because I had been... Well, I learned a long time ago not to fight it. How long did this act last? Less than five minutes. Yeah, and then he used the phone and he left. But he, he, he came back again. I remember, it was right after my knee surgery. I was in my chair and I was wearing this little sun dress. And then he started touching me and -- so, when he came back, did you know who it was at your door? Yes. I have a glass -- and even with this prior experience, you still asked deputy mccrane to come back in? Well, I just -- he was standing there. And, and -- I didn't think -- you asked him to come in. Uh -- did you ask deputy mccrane why he kissed you there at the door before he proceeded to your living room? No, I didn't. And when he exposed himself to you, you didn't ask him what he was doing? No, bill, I didn't. Then what happened? He put his hand on the back of my head and he pulled me down to make me have oral sex on him. Did you consent to that or not? I, I did it, and I didn't want to. You never did express that to him? No, I think that my body language -- how would he know if he was doing something that he wasn't supposed to be doing? He's a married man. He's a grown man. I'm asking a question. How would he know you weren't consenting to this? Mccrane: I think I can answer that. I have never forced myself on anyone, but I have been in situations where a lot of women seem to like me and I would give in to that in a mutual way. I'm not justifying my actions, but I have been a Deacon in the church, and I fell away from the lord. And if you help me to get through this, this is it for me. This ends it. I have been a good and gentle man to my family for 23 years. But I have got off to some consensual things with some of these women, which I sincerely do regret. But that does not mean that god does not forgive me. And it doesn't mean that I can't overcome this. Man: Everything okay? I hope so. Don't worry about it. I want you to follow up with the appeal board. What's this about a no bill? That is correct, that's decided. Scott: You're ignoring the witnesses? What are they saying? Scott: I do mind, that's right, I mind. That's really great for a county attorney. Thank you very much. Mccrane said that he had consensual sex with all of you. Kathy: What? He admitted he had sex with US? Consensual sex. What he testified to was that, in each encounter, each of you agreed to the sex -- that you wanted it. Well, he's lying. You get me in that room, Scott. It's too late -- the county attorney is not going to call you or Carole. It's a no bill, which means mccrane's not going to be charged -- I'm sorry. Tell me, Mr. Gibson, do you have a daughter? A sister, a mother, a wife? It was up to the grand jury. No, it was up to you first! God help you. And god help every woman out there, because you just released a monster in their backyard! Excuse me. You're in my way. Want some more? No, I won't sleep. I won't sleep anyway, may as well, thanks. What's so grand about a grand jury? It's not the jury, it's the prosecution. Doug's absolutely right. Gibson didn't consider your polygraphs, he didn't let Kathy or you testify to establish a pattern of behavior. Well, I mean, as far as I can tell, the man did not explain to the grand jury the standard of proof to get an indictment. Well, isn't there any way around Gibson? Yeah, in lang county? It hasn't happened since Moses parted the sea. Scott: We don't have a criminal case. That's over. So I guess sending Gibson a bill for our gas money is out of the question. Scott: It is. But -- there might be another bill we can send him. Okay. We're dead in criminal court, but there may be civil relief. A lawsuit? Federal court in St. Paul. We're still outside the statute, though, Kathy and me. He intimidated you to keep you from coming forward. He stopped all of you from court access for 13 years. That's not only a crime, that may well be a violation of your civil rights. But isn't civil court about money? Yeah. This can't just be about the money. I mean, can't we get him out of law enforcement, for good? I don't know. But it's a shot. It's a shot. It's even odds. More time, but, and this is very important, it will never work veless you all agree. We all have to be in together. You all have to be in together. [ Sigh ] Todd wants this over. Well, I'm just sick of being scared. Hey, I'm scared, too. But what about the other women? All the other women John mccrane is going to hurt -- next month, and the month after. I mean, sure, we can quit, tell ourselves, "nice try." But how are we going to feel when we hear about those women? And we will hear about them. [ Sigh ] Well, that's good of you to say. [ Chuckling ] Sheriff Owen Bradley? Yeah. I tried to pick him up. Good morning, sheriff. Your subpoena, sir. Sir, you are going to be deposed. Sir. Bye, Gayle. I'll call you after lunch. Scott: So you met with Mr. Mccrane in your office on February 16th to discuss the accusations in Ellis county. Did you ask him about a letter that appeared in the fremont newspaper at that time? Yes, I did. Was he aware of the challenge issued by Mr. and Mrs. Clifson to take a polygraph test? He was aware -- as a matter of fact -- I, uh, I asked him to take the test. And did Mr. Mccrane take a polygraph? He did. At my office. Do you have the results of that test? Did you tell anyone else that Mr. Mccrane had failed a polygraph? No. Did you tell agent Carter? No. Bill Gibson? No. Prior to his failing the polygraph, had Mr. Mccrane ever acknowledged sexual contact with any of the women, forceful or otherwise? Zero. He totally denied it. So you knew that Mr. Mccrane had flat-out lied to you about having sexual contact with the victims, is that correct? That's correct. Scott: Do rapists usually admit they have committed the crime of rape? I don't know. I guess not. Mm-hmm, and if they do deny it, isn't it important for a law enforcement agency to be ready to prove they're not telling the truth? Well, that sounds -- I mean -- yes, that's right. And if that's right, and you're trying to expose a rapist as a liar, do you think it's sound police procedure to furnish the rapist with the entire investigative report that you have at your disposal? I, uh -- I don't know. Agent Carter, did you talk to John mccrane about his encounters with Camille fenton? No, sir. About his encounters with Lynn Jordan? No, sir. Did you talk to him about any purported victim? Kathy clifson, Carole bakelin? No, sir. And yet, you were assigned to investigate whether or not John mccrane committed criminal sexual misconduct against these women, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Mr. Mccrane. Hi, John. Have a seat. Good morning. Hi there. Scott: So we've established four different statements by four different women about sexual encounters they had with you, is that correct, Mr. Mccrane? Yes. And you recognize that each woman tells a different story than you? Yes. And yet, they passed a polygraph test. Your polygraph, you failed. You failed because you couldn't answer truthfully. So I'm going to ask you again, Mr. Mccrane, did you have forced sex with Kathy clifson? Did you have forced sex with Carole bakelin? Have you had forced sex with any woman since 1990? True or false, Mr. Mccrane? True or false? False. False. The man, woman: I was 17 once.Fficer guy, you know what you're doing. Woman: Oh, yeah. Woman: Yeah. Look, it's possible he's a real bad apple, it's just hard to tell. But here's the thing -- you get right down to it, all of these women more or less asked for it. I don't think they asked for it, but, well, it's true, they didn't say no. "No" isn't that hard to say, no matter how scared you are. Why didn't they just say no? And by the way, two of the women are girlfriends from way back, so, you know, they may just be reinforcing each other. Woman: That's true, people tend to do that. Woman: Well, of course they do, one story leads to another, it's perfectly natural. They're not getting it. They believe mccrane, not US. I don't know what the hell else we're supposed to do. It's like being raped again. But this is a mock jury, right? Yeah, but it's probably the way a real jury's going to go down. Woman: On the issue of intimidation, all those opposed, say "aye." All: Aye. And on the issue of damages, all those opposed, say "aye." All: Aye. [ Imitating airplane ] I should have shot him. Maybe I could have grabbed his gun. Fought him harder, something. Come on, baby, it's just one mock jury. And Scott's putting together another test panel, right? Yeah. But they're just going to be looking at the same videotape, asking the same questions. Doug. Doug! Do you know what happened? It was poison. [ Sniffs ] I know how much you loved him. Where's Brian? With mom. I can't protect you. You and Brian -- I mean, they killed my dog. They'd do anything. [ Sniffling ] I'm going to resign. No. I'm fine. We can't quit. No, we're going to leave Minnesota. And go where? Home, Wisconsin. We can come back for the trial, but we're going to leave. I'm so sorry, Doug. I'm so sorry. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Teri. We're here to see Scott, with Dr. Tobin. I'll let him know. Scott wanted me to thank you for coming here to his office. Oh, it's fine, I had business at the capitol, so it worked out. He's putting together a second mock jury. The last one, this deputy, he charmed them like he did the rest of US. Abusive men often use charm to exploit a woman's vulnerability. Charm is his weapon. Hello, ladies. Just in time for lunch. I hope you brought your appetites. This is Dr. Tobin. Nancy Tobin. Scott Miller. Nice to meet you. You know, I have to tell you, when Kathy told me she found a clinical psychologist on the Internet, I thought, "oh, no, here we go, off into talk radio land." Oh, no, they won't have me -- not flashy enough. Oh, well, I read your book. Good. And we'll have you. Dr. Tobin, in your report, you don't even allow for the possibility that these sexual relationships were consensual. Tobin: That's correct. Can such a report be truly objective, then? Most women who are forced, or coerced, into having sex with a man develop psychological symptoms that support their allegations and completely negate the possibility that they consented. [ Chuckling ] What? These women believe that if they resist or they report the attack, that the man will make good on his implied or direct threats to harm them. They fear exposure will cost them their reputations, careers. The fact is, they may have developed learned helplessness. The fact also is, a woman is never, ever to blame. I may develop learned helplessness trying to get through your report. What is learned helplessness? A psychological condition that leaves them paralyzed to take any action against the man. Isn't that overstated? It is understated. These women, during the course of their life, have learned to fear authority. They have learned that they cannot predict which of their actions will protect them and which ones will cause them more harm. A battered woman, if she sees her husband getting angry, is much less likely to walk out the door if she cannot predict if leaving or not will harm her. If she leaves, her husband may beat her again, or, this time, he may kill her. Resistance is not a behavior that she can count on, so when she's in danger, she is not going to leave, she is not going to fight back, and she is not going to say no. Man: You're saying, what, that because these women all have learned helplessness, Mr. Mccrane somehow guessed that, that makes him a, a sexual predator? Tobin: I'm saying that Mr. Mccrane's behavior is consistent with others who are sexual predators. It is in my professional opinion, based on a reasonable degree of psychological certainty -- and I have reviewed every document in this case -- that Kathy clifson, Carole bakelin, Camille fenton, and Lynn Jordan were all sexually assaulted by John mccrane. Man: "Reasonable degree of psychological certainty," just what does that mean, Dr. Tobin? Tobin: More likely than not. Man: Well, that just happens to be the standard of proof in this case. Tobin: Exactly. How much money are we allowed to give these women? Woman: Well, it says -- so we have a chance? More than we had. [ Sigh ] Oh, finally. [ Whispering ] Doug? Yeah, I'm up here. Hey. Hey. So, the truck's all packed. Yeah, everything but the beds. I'll pack them in the morning. Are you all right? Yeah, great. I was just... Watching him breathe. I, uh, I called the lady at child services and gave her our forwarding address. I just have one more paper to sign, and -- and he's my son. Say that again. What? "My son." Our son. Mr. Miller? For the plaintiffs, your honor. That makes you Mr. Grant? Representing lang county, your honor. Are you prepared to go to trial, Mr. Miller? Yes, your honor. And you, Mr. Grant? We are, your honor. Good for you, but my interest is saving the court time. Counselors, I'm ordering mediation in this matter. Settle on a mediator and keep me informed. Thank you. Scott: But, ahem, your honor, respectfully -- Mr. Miller, unless you're telling me that you and Mr. Grant have come to an agreement, I can't imagine what else there is to say. Next case. [ Pounds gavel ] Kathy: We don't want an agreement, we want to be able to walk down the street without people whispering like we're the criminals. I can't change the order to bargain, Kathy. But if we make an agreement, then John mccrane goes on with his life like nothing ever happened. We want him to be seen for who he really is. We want his badge. Look, maybe we can make a deal to unseal the records, make what he did public once and for all. I don't know, I can try. Carole: I should have brought my knitting, I could have stitched a whole parka by now. Doug: They're just trying to wear you down. Well, it won't work. Will it? I think we should stop listening to offers. Until they're talking about the same things we are, it's just too hard. Yeah, I agree. Ladies, okay, here's where we're at. Scott, we're thinking this is pointless. I mean, until they're willing to talk about -- I know you're frustrated, just -- here's where we're at. Okay, $350,000. Wow, another $15,000. The county will have to cancel their Christmas pageant. They've dropped their demand for schedule of payments. Lump sum is okay. Scott. This is about John mccrane. And all records are unsealed. All the court records? Grand jury testimony, civil depositions, unsealed, public domain. Lynn: That's great. Scott: One more thing. Mccrane's badge. He resigned. Oh, my god. But what if he moves, can't he get another badge? Not a soul in law enforcement would ever hire this guy again, not ever. I mean, they'd be looking at horrendous legal exposure, not to mention that he cost his county big-time money. And he insulted good lawmen all over this country -- it's not going to happen. You stopped him. All of you. You won. I'm so happy. Oh. Thank you. Congratulations. Scott, thank you. I love you so much. I love you, too. I couldn't have done it without you. Scott: Pepe's, just down the block, best margaritas in town. I just got to talk to the judge. We won't start without you. Yeah, we will! All right, I'm going to get the car, I'll see you guys over there. Guacamole. Yeah, I know, I'm starving! Lynn: Come on, Camille. Grant: No, no, you don't understand. Jail is not an option -- this was not a trial, this was mediation. Also, you're going to have to declare bankruptcy. That is not an option. Your wife, however, does -- you have no choice but to -- hey, hey. I just want you to know, we've set aside $10,000 for you -- when you finally realize you need help. Let's go. Come on. It's time we have some fun.
