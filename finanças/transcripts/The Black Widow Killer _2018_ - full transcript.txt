Janet? Yeah? Start it up. ENGINE FAILS TO START All right, turn it off, turn it off. Try it again. ENGINE FAILS TO START It won't start. Janet! WIND CHIMES PLAY PHONE RINGS Morn, your phone's ringing. You told me six months ago when we hired you that you would be done the job on time. Yes, you did. That's why you were awarded the contract in the first place. No, no. There was two other bids that matched yours but timing was the issue, which is why we're... Mm-hm. Right. And do you really think that you're the first company to prolong a construction gig just to get more money? No. No. That that was not an accusation, that was a question. Yeah. I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen. You are gonna finish the job for the agreed-upon price by the agreed-upon date and you're gonna it to code because if you don't, there'll be no final payment issued. Well, What? would love to see you in court. Yeah, and we have a great lawyer. It's me. Hello? It's 8:30 in the morning, Mom. You have to be up early to get ahead of the game. Who's that? What is it? What? don't know. What's that? Divorce papers. You have to get up early to stay ahead of the game. Come on. What? don't want to be late for school. What? mean, all things considered, it could have been worse than your marriage just running its course. Oh, just running its course. That's cute. I'll remember that when you hit your 40s and your high school sweetheart leaves you because your relationship just ran its course. OK. Well, it wasn't a total loss. You had me. Oh, that's so true. But if I'm being honest, that investment has yet to pay off. Oh, it will. Hey-hey. Morning, girls. How's it going? Oh, it's bad. Don't ask. How bad? Not totally sure. She says What? won't be able to relate until Daniel dumps me in 20 years. He won't. What? won't let him. Hey, are you going to need a ride after school? No. What? have a date with my future ex-husband. We're on a Monday? Yeah. See you later. See you in class? Yes. What happened? Divorce papers came. It only took a year. Mm. More than a year, actually. You know, my son's going out on a date tonight, which means I'm free for consoling my fellow divorcee with one cheesecake. Mm. What? meant chocolate cake. Mm. Don't even pretend. You know you want it. Yeah, OK. I'll text you. Love you. Love you. Happy anniversary. Oh, What? forgot. Really? What? What? What is that? Well, traditionally second anniversary gifts are made of cotton. What? didn't go for them. Open it. It's beautiful. Well, it has to be. What? love it. What? love you. You better. Things work differently in the public sector and you're in the public sector. But there's a contract and it stipulates that if there's going to be a delay in the materials, then they have to let us know immediately and provide us proof. What? mean, he's known about this for the last four weeks. It's a con. What? mean, I've seen this before. We've all seen this before but we have to go with it. You just don't want a lawsuit. Lawsuits are expensive. What? would be the one to fight it. And you probably win but you're not a lawyer any more, Judy. You're the deputy mayor. Steven. How have you been? Good. Good. I'll leave you guys. Yeah. They swing by this morning? Yeah. Yeah, they sure did. What? mean, What? watched them jam the papers in the mailbox then scurry away. Wasn't supposed to be that indelicate. They were supposed to knock on the door, present them with some... respect? Professionalism. Right. OK, well, What? will try to look at them this week. And if you want them signed, then What? suggest that you pick them up yourself. With some professionalism. It's not like the last 25 years have been the best ever, Jude. No. OK. What? know that. All right. And What? know that marriage is not all wine and cake and... What? get it, OK. You don't want to feel like you're in your 40s and you've wasted the best years on a bad marriage. So if you fix it, you get right back on track, right? Kinda, yeah. But you can't fix it. Steven knows that, you know that, even Abbey knows that. What? know. Sign the papers. Coast along. It's been a year. It's always the hardest with the birthdays, the holidays. Blah blah blah. But soon it's gonna be two years, then three, and then it's all just a distant memory. Yeah, OK, What? know that and it's not like I've been drowning myself in vino or bawling my eyes out every night. Some nights. Some nights you've been a blubbering mess. Hey, What? got text evidence so I'm just saying. Thank you. Thank you for reminding me. SHE LAUGHS It would just be so much easier if What? didn't have to see him so many times a week. Get out of the public service. Go back to your private practice. You're still gonna have to see him because of Abbey. Yeah, until she's in university which, by the way, What? really hope that Daniel doesn't try to convince her to stay because that's not going to go well. No. If anything, he's just gonna, you know, follow her wherever she goes. You think so? Yeah. What? mean, they've got something that's pretty special. We both had something pretty special when we were younger too. Mm-hm. And look how that turned out. Well, just because we were abject failures in romance doesn't mean that our kids are gonna be, right? Yeah, yeah. More wine. In time she'll be fine. What? just want her to be fine now. What? mean, I'm the kid here. I'm the one who's supposed to be all messed up about their parents splitting up. But even I'm over it. You're talking about 7-year-olds, not us. How long did it take your mom to get over splitting up with your dad? Not that long, but catching him in bed with another woman kind of expedited that process. Yeah. But hey, it's our anniversary. Let's keep our parents out of it. Yeah. Ah. That was fun. You sure you're OK to drive? Yeah. Yeah. Two glasses of wine in three hours? OK. All right. All right. See you. Love you. See you tomorrow? Mm-hm. What? love you. You better. DOOR OPENS Mm - little late for a Monday night, don't you think? Don't worry Mom, I'm still a virgin. You don't really think I'm that dumb, do you? To believe I'm a vestal maiden, or to fall for the diversion tactic? Both. Hey. Beautiful. Where'd you get it from? Just something Daniel got me. Because it's your anniversary. That's right. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Well, What? mean... Hey, you don't have to hide being happy from me, OK. What? think it's wonderful that your relationship is going so well. Really? Yeah. Don't worry about me. What? mean, everything in my life is going magnificently. And getting to be happy. All right. Night. Night. Love you. Love you too. Happy anniversary. Thank you. So What? guess you're sleeping in here. Come on, Mom. Sleep it off upstairs. Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Hello. What? need help. My mom is not responding. PHONE RINGS Hey, what is it? Is Abbey home? Yeah. Why? The two of you need to come into the station right now. Steven? Hey. Come on in. It's a start. Hey. Hi, sweetheart. Hey. What's going on? It's Kendra. Where is she? When Danny got home last night after dropping you off... ...she was unresponsive. What... Steven.. What... Where is she? He called the ambulance and the paramedics got there and... Paramedics got there and what? She's gone, honey. But... She's dead? Yeah. What? just saw her, Steven. What do you... What happened? We're going to find out. Jude. There are some things we have to talk about. So Daniel tells us you were at a movie together last night. Yeah. Till what time? Around... midnight, What? guess. Yeah. Yeah. No. It was then. What? was... What? was still up. Why? Were you just waiting for Abbey? What? was going over divorce papers. Was there anything different about Daniel last night? No. He was same as always. What is it with all the questions? What? just have to ask. When you had drinks with Kendra, was there anything different about her? She say anything? Not a thing. OK. Are we done? Hey, kiddo. Steven says we can take you home now, OK. Listen, What? feel like What? saw someone last night outside of the restaurant. It looked like he was watching us. Did you get a look at him? No. No, not closely. But something... What? mean, something feels very off here. All right. Anything else comes up, you let me know. And the moment that you know what happened, What? know. OK? Absolutely. Take care of her. Anything she needs. Whatever What? can do. Got to go. If you want, you can just stay home with Daniel. Need a bit of a distraction. OK. If you change your mind and you want to come home, just call me and I'll come to pick you up, whatever. OK. We have to get out of here! Hey, Judy. What? just heard about Kendra. What? don't know what to say. Thank you. Can you look someone up for me? Um... OK. What's the name? Jason Hall. I've a Jason Alexander Hall here, originally from Mill Creek. Yeah. That's the one. What? have an address out of state. Can you print it out for me? Sure. Thanks. Hi. What are you doing? I'm just trying to get a bit organised here. Why? The school called me this morning to sub in for a little while. Are you in this class? Fourth period. You know they called an assembly. About Kendra Wilson. What? know. I'm Ms Evans. Abbey Dwyer. What? understand you and Miss Wilson were close. Who told you that? Oh, the administration told me you might not come in today. You or her son Daniel. You know, it's customary to let anyone in her class miss the day so we won't be doing anything too noteworthy. In fact, we might just be talking. You think people are going to talk to you about her? They can if they want. I'll see you in fourth period. Maybe. We need to talk about something. What? saw these last night. What? didn't even finish reading them. What? just... What? don't care. It's about Daniel. What about him? What? just think right now might be best if we Abbey spent a little time away from him. What? Why? You're right about Kendra - this whole thing's suspicious. No witnesses, no signs of forced entry. What? sent her bloodwork to the lab to be tested. Could take a few days. What? just... You think that Daniel is a suspect? Because that's ridiculous, Steven. No, that's not what I'm saying. What? want to be safe and until What? can clear him, What? would just like you guys to distance yourselves... Daniel. Daniel! What? thought he was with Abbey. God dammit, Steven! I'll go get him. You know what? No. Just please find out what happened to Kendra. Please. Daniel? Oh, hey. What? could have come and got you. I'm gonna kill Dad. What? take it that you talked to Daniel. Yeah. Of course. Dad is such... Just stop it. Your father, he, he loves Daniel. He's just being cautious. He was in the room. It was, it was bad timing. Well, he just made a horrible thing a whole lot worse. So where is Daniel? What? had to convince him to come back. He'll be here later. OK. Excuse me. Yeah. Do you work here? What do you think? Fair enough. Listen, that apartment up there - was there a man by the name of Jason Hall that lived there? You know Jason? Yes, well, What? did. Hah! Everybody coming out of the woodwork. Sorry? Some other woman came here last week. Got him all riled up so he skipped out on a month's rent. You find him, you let me know. Yeah. Thank you. You know, What? know that but they know that line below that, it says "inconclusive". What? need to you to tell me exactly what that means. Steven. OK, so that's positive? What? know What? understand that there's always room for error but whatever small percentages, you're positive? Yeah. OK. Thank you. What's up? What? just... What? got to thinking about that guy at the restaurant and... just hear me out, OK. So What? had a feeling and What? followed up on it. Now Jason Hall, he's been living out of state for quite some time now. And when What? went there, the guy that runs the place, he said that some woman stopped by last week and got him all riled up. And now he's disappeared. Judy. It's not a coincidence, Steven. What? mean, 25 years go by and then nothing. And then Kendra dies and Jason's doing... What is this? Coroner's report. That's who What? was just talking to. Heart failure? It's what it says. But what if it's wrong? It's not wrong. There is a chance she could have been poisoned. Toxicology specialist tell me they're fast-tracking the bloodwork. What? should have answers soon. How's Abbey? Tell her I'm just doing my job, right? You're her father and Daniel's the love of her life. She couldn't care less about your job. Fine. Whatever. She can think what she wants. If I'm right about this... What if I'm right about Jason? Hm? So What? guess you're assuming you see him outside the restaurant. Yeah. What? am. It's a danger, Well, maybe, but it'll be 25 years ago next week. OK. This has nothing to do with that. What? have work to do. Given Ms Wilson's passing, the school has opted to delay any upcoming tests and extend any existing deadlines on assignments by one week. However, if anyone wants to hand in their assignments as planned, go ahead. BELL RINGS Anyone needing to talk, our doors are always open. Hi, Abbey. What? understand Ms Wilson's son Daniel is staying with you. That's right. How's he doing? Ask him yourself. Hi Daniel. I'm Ms Evans. What? was just letting Abbey know to tell you that the school is prepared to grant you an exemption. Sorry. Who are you? A substitute. For my mom? Can we go? Yeah. This is the weirdest feeling in the world. What? have no idea what to do. Yeah, What? know. Excuse me. You're Daniel Wilson, aren't you? And you're Abbey Dwyer. Who are you? What? knew your mother. What do you want? What? warned her. What? You all need to leave. You, her mother, her father. What? All of you. None of you are safe here any more. Leave town now, before anyone else is killed. Killed?! You're saying someone killed my mom?! Hey! I'm talking to you! Daniel! Hey! Daniel! And he didn't tell you his name? No. And that's everything that he told you? Yeah. Who is he? His name is Jason Hall. Did he really know Mom? Yeah. No, they actually even, they dated for a time in high school. Why would he say it was a murder if she died of a heart attack? Listen, Daniel, What? Jason, he's just, he's not the most stable guy, and they broke up right before he went to prison. For what? Vehicular manslaughter. He killed somebody? It was an accident and it's, you know, it's very, it's very complicated. But, listen, if you see him again, and especially if he approaches you, What? want you to call your father and tell him where you are. OK? Mm-hmm. OK. I'm going to do some e-mails for your mom's service, so do you want to... Yeah. Just going to watch something in my room. OK. SHE SIGHS He served 13 years of a 15-year sentence. Yeah? And he's been out for 12 years. OK. OK, so he's off, he's off the map for a decade, and then some woman shows up and he flips out, he ends up back here, and then Kendra dies. OK, so the woman is Kendra. Why does she go see him? The accident. Oh, here we go. Why do you have such a problem with this? Because it's a stretch, Jude. You're a lawyer, you know that. What? don't care, Steven He approached our daughter. What? need you to get me those toxicology results. And let me guess, you're going to go find Jason Hall? Yes, What? am, and anything else that points to him. You want proof? I'll get it. So either Dad or What? will pick you up after school, OK? And What? don't want you to worry about that man. If you don't want me to worry about him, why are you walking me all the way to the front door? What? just thought you want me to. Hi, Abbey. Hey. Is this your mom? Yeah. Alice Evans. Judy Dwyer. What? understand you and Kendra Wilson were quite close. I'm very sorry. Thank you. So, you're a teacher here? Yes. Listen, there's a man, Jason Hall, Abbey can describe him to you. If you see him around, can you let the Sheriff's Office know? He just gave her quite a scare yesterday. Of course. No problem. Are you OK? Fine. Thank you. Thanks so much. OK. I'll see you after school. Mm-hmm. Was he threatening you in some way? LAUGHTER What are you doing here? What? just came to pick up some photos for the funeral. Hey, Rob. Um... What's going on? Toxicology came back. Uh-huh? They found elevated levels of succinic acid and choline in her system. Suxamethonium chloride in her wine. What, what is, what is that? It's poison, Jude. It kills by paralysis, affects every organ in the body, including the heart. Oh, my God! So, she was murdered? She was. I'm so sorry. Bill? A word? Just leave it with me, all right? OK. You were supposed to be taking some time off. What... Are you OK? What's going on? Listen, do you, do you remember Jason Hall? Yeah, of course. Jason was the youngest kid What? ever prosecuted. OK, well, What? need to find him, because What? think that he has something to do with Kendra's murder. Murder?! Toxicology came back. There was poison in her wine. Oh, my God! Why would Jason Hall have anything to do with that? Look, it's a really long story, but he's involved, and What? know it, and What? need you to talk to Steven and get him moving in that direction. OK? I've been pushing this on a hunch, but What? know that I'm right, and he just, he's, he's not listening to me. Well, OK, What? prefer to leave police matters to the police. Bill, when have What? ever let you down? OK. All right, I'll speak to him. Thank you. Thanks. So, that weird guy was telling the truth? Something like that. And you really think he has something to do with it? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. Oh, my God. What are you doing? Let him go! Abbey... Let him go! He didn't do anything! Abbey! What? He didn't do anything! Abbey, back off! What, you think he killed his own mom?! He has no-one left! You just need to arrest someone, is that it?! Abbey! You didn't do anything! What? know, but you have to stop, please. It's all right, just give her a minute. Really? Hey! Don't you worry, we're gonna get you out, OK? We're gonna get him out. ENGINE STARTS You can't really believe that he did this. We found poison in the basement. She bought the wine the day before, and by all accounts, including his own, he was the only one with access, and his prints were on the bottle. Steven, he has no motive whatsoever! That you know of. But you've been questioning him? Yes. And? Nothing. So you're just kicking the kid while he's down? You think this doesn't bother me, Jude? Do you think it doesn't break my heart, seeing him in there? What? can't ignore the evidence. But you know that he didn't do it! What? don't know that! What? don't know that. What? can believe it, but that doesn't help. How's Abbey holding up? She's a mess. She hates me. She's disappointed in you. And she wants to see him. OK. She can see him tomorrow. And Jason Hall? What about him? Oh, come on, Steven! This comes back to the accident! You know it! No, What? don't! What? don't know that. I'm really getting tired of this accident thing, Jude. It is the only motive that exists! How? How? How is it? What? don't, What?, What? don't know yet, but you know what, you're gonna get Daniel out of that chair and you're gonna put Jason in it. Excuse me? No, What? will not excuse you. This isn't your wife speaking. You saw to that. This is your boss. The mayor is my boss, not the deputy mayor. Who What? somehow doubt, when it comes to you and What?, that he'll side with you on that. HE SIGHS Steven, look at these. Where did you get these? What? got one in the mail yesterday, and Kendra, she got one before she was murdered. What? mean, it says "vengeance" and "judgement". Steve, come on. That's not Daniel, that is Jason. This is, this is the warning he was talking about. Possibly, but... you wouldn't forecast like this if you were trying to get away with murder. OK, what if, what if he's, what if he's not trying to get away with it? What if he's warning them because he knows that he's messed up and he might do it again? All right. OK. I'll look into it. OK, you're just going to look into it? OK, Jude, What? believe you. OK? It's enough to bring him in, but What? can't flip this whole investigation or let anyone go because you handed me a couple of cryptic pieces of paper. What? What? didn't fabricate those! What? know! You're only facing "Jason this, Jason that," I've got Abbey actually smacking me in my face. There's a kid in there who I've known his entire life, and his mother who was my high school friend is lying dead on a slab in the morgue! What the hell makes you think I'm not doing anything?! You know why you were surprised by this divorce, Jude? Because you didn't see it coming. You didn't see the signs, you weren't listening. And when you did listen, you didn't hear. I'm going to walk. I'll see you at home. OK. Hey! Hey! Mom? Hey! Mom?! Hey! Mom?! Hey! What's going on? That was Jason Hall. He's here? Yeah. All right, make the call. You know what to say. OK. TYRES SCREECH, CRASH Jason, what the hell?! Told you, you were driving too fast! PHONE RINGS - Dwyer. - Hello, Steven. Who's this? An old friend. Jason? You know, What? must say, What? was surprised to find out you and Judy split up. You seemed so perfect together. What can What? do for you? What? think it's more of a question of what What? can do for you. I'm listening. The boy didn't kill his mother. OK, then, who did? YOU did. Jason, I'm here. You wanted to meet face-to-face. Why don't you come on out? What? don't have time for games, Jason. CLATTER Look, What? know Daniel didn't kill Kendra. What? sure as hell know What? didn't kill her. You want to prove it wasn't you, you need to come out here and talk to me. Come on, Jason! GUN COCKS No! GUNSHOTS PHONE RINGS Hello? This is she. Whenever you're ready. DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES We have no idea why he was there. He might have been investigating something. There was a call to his office from an unknown number, about a half-hour before, and we're looking into that, but he told no-one he was going out there. We found these in his desk. Do they mean anything to you? Urn... One of them was sent to Kendra, and one of them was sent to me. Wait, what is this? There were three. He got one, too. What do they mean? What? think these are from Jason Hall. You really believe he's involved, don't you. Yes, Bill, What? really do. Whoever it is... ...we are going to find them. What is, what's happening with Daniel Wilson? He is going to have to stay where he is for now. If we find Steven's murder tied to Kendra's, it'll be a different story. Which, if your instincts are correct, is just a matter of time. But for now we just have to wait. I'm sorry. Sir, we can't keep them waiting any longer. What? have to go. PHONE RINGS Hello? Hi, is this Judy? This is she. Great. This is Alice Evans, from Abbey's school. Oh, right. Hi. Hey, are you still looking for that guy you were talking to me about? The one that scared Abbey a few clays ago? Yes. Yes, What? am. OK, What? don't know if it's him, but What? did see someone that fits the exact description Abbey gave me at the motel today. The one with the gas station across the street. Well, What? was in there and he came in while What? was getting gas, and What? watched him go across to the motel. OK, great. Thank you. You're welcome. Good evening. Hi there. I'm Judy Dwyer, I'm the deputy mayor. Sheriff Dwyer's my husband. What can What? do for you? You have a guest staying here by the name of Jason Hall? I'm not allowed to give that information, ma'am. OK, well, you know, why don't you call the Sheriff's Office and tell them that you're not cooperating with me, and the next people to walk through that door will be the police and probably the mayor. Then we can all discuss the hourly rates you provide for some of the girls around here. OK? It's Jason Hall. Yeah, he checked in last week. What clay? Saturday. Saturday night. ls he still here? As far as What? can see. Take me to his room. DIAL TONE This is it here. HE KNOCKS, DOOR CREAKS Jason? Hello? What the hell's that? SHE GASPS Hey, that's you, isn't it? Call the police. Right now. TYRES SCREECH That's quite a bit of work in there. Yeah. How did you know to come here? What? asked one of the teachers at the school to keep an eye out for him, and she did. Well, they've got an APB out on him, so... Good. Jason Hall was the one driving the car that hit Shannon Collins and Kyle Hanson. So, how do you and Kendra and Steven figure into this? How do Abbey and Daniel figure into this? We found something. There's blood here. It's fresh, in the last day. There are a few drops on the door as well. We can't tell yet if it's coming or going. So, something happened in here. That's not all. There wasn't a single fingerprint, not on any of this. Really? Not one. But what about the rest of the place? Prints everywhere, but it's a motel, so... What do you think that means, then? First guess? He's very meticulous with his arts and crafts. And a second guess? He didn't do all this. He has help? No, if anything, he clashed with someone. And then they took him from this place. And then they planted this. And sent the letters. Exactly. OK. Why would somebody do all that? To implicate him. Hey. What'cha doing? Nothing. You want to talk about anything? No. OK. Listen, What? want you to stay home from school for a couple of clays, OK? Yeah, sure. Whoever killed Kendra, killed Dad, didn't they? Yeah, sweetie, What? think so. Why aren't they letting Daniel go? What? don't know, honey. What? asked them the same thing. You think it's that Jason Hall guy who's doing this? Honestly, Abs... ...I don't know any more. You're going to find him, though, right? Yes. I'm going to find him. Come here. I'm so sorry. So, how far back are we going? 25 years. Is that the one? That's the one. Thank you. "3am crash. Driver..." TYRES SCREECH, CRASH SHE MUTTERS Jude! "One other survivor, Shannon Collins." Please! Don't leave me! Jude! Judy, come on! We can't just leave them under there! PHONE RINGS Hi. Judy, we need to get down to the old bridge right away. Why? What's going on? Just... get down here. Yeah, OK, I'm on my way. POLICE RADIO CHATTER Stand behind the line, please! What's going on? It's Jason Hall. He's here? What? don't think that Jason Hall killed Kendra, or Steve, or himself. We don't know that. He could have easily got himself up there, tied the noose and jumped. Might have felt us getting too close and decided that was it. No, Tyson, this isn't a suicide. And today, it isn't a coincidence. What does that mean? Well, today it's the 25th anniversary of the accident. That wall in his motel room -, someone they set that up to make it look like he was guilty. And this, What? Mean, it was all staged to look like a suicide so that... so that it tidies everything up for us. You know, you're on that wall, and you got a letter, too. What? know, What? know that. And that's why we have to find out what happened after the accident. What? mean, What? can't find any information on Jason's family. What? know that he lived with his mother, but she died when he was in jail. Yeah, we looked into that. There is no other family. What? have to find Shannon Collins. You know where she is? No. But What? know where she was. Bill, I'm going to need a court order for Shana Collins' medical records from Pine Grove Hospital. I'll be there in about two hours. All right. That should be enough time to get hold of the judge. Here it is. Oh, great, thank you. What? remember Shannon. Horrible accident. She was here for nearly 18 months. She's something of a legendary case here. Medical miracle, really. She flatlined for six minutes at Mill Creek Memorial in ER. Doctors brought her back. In a coma for many months, then she came here. What? worked on her myself. Four operations to reconstruct her shoulder and hip. Eight operations to reconstruct her face. My last surgery, actually. ENGINE STALLS It won't start! One good photo to work from leaves you very little to work with. And in all that time she never said a word. What? guess a broken heart's the one thing we can't repair. TYRES SCREECH Shannon! But after the last surgery, she finally spoke. CRASH She said it made her feel like a new person. Is this your mom? Alice Evans. What? could swear What? saw someone that fits the exact description at the motel today. LAUGHTER Are you OK? Right in front of me. Thank you. Yeah, she's a new teacher at the school. 694 Old Orchard Road. Thank you. SHE SCREAMS Alice? It's beautiful. Where did you get it from? Just something Daniel got me. Hey, you've reached Abbey Dwyer. Leave me a message. Abbey, honey, you call me as soon as you get this, OK? Abbey! Abbey! Abbey! Abbey! Where are you?! Abbey! Where are you?! All the note says is it's my life for Abbey's. But no specific place? No. Are you sure it's Shannon Collins? Yes. Bill, she has been here the whole time. What? have met her! What? mean, but it's not her, she's, What? Mean, she's different. She's completely changed. She's going under the name Alice Evans, and I'm guessing the dead woman that What? just found, that's the real Alice Evans. It all makes sense now. What do you mean that makes sense? Steven was killed at the old mill, so we did some digging. Kyle Hanson's family closed down the place and moved away after his death, but they still own it. Oh, my God! Abbey's got to be there. What? mean, that is the only place left. But What? still don't understand. What does this have to do with you? Look, Bill, it doesn't matter. You just get as many people there as you can. ENGINE STALLS Try it again. It won't start! Shannon! We have to get out of here! Jason, what the hell?! COUGHING What? told you, you were driving too fast, Jason! Oh, my God! Somebody's under there! Kendra, get back in the car! What did you do? She's dead. Steven? Steven! Judy, you don't need to see this. We just killed someone?! No, HE did! What?! We have to get out of here! It's my dad's car! They'll know it was me! But they won't know it was us! What are you talking about? Were WE driving like that?! Did WE do this?! No! We can't just leave. We have to. It does no good for us to stay. But it's wrong. No, it isn't! We didn't do this. Kendra... You can't be serious! We, we can't just leave them under there. We can't just leave Jason alone. Jason will go into town and tell the cops what he did - it was an accident. You were alone in the car. You got that? Steven, let him go! You got that?! Go! Come on, let's go. Come on, Jude. WHIMPERING I'm sorry. Abbey?! Abbey! Abbey! Hello, Judy. All those years, you never knew What? saw you. All of you. At least Jason had the guts to admit what he did. But what choice did you give him? It was an accident! Then why did you run?! You let your little boyfriend tell you what to do. And you ran away. Leaving me to die. It was wrong, and you knew it was wrong. You knew it! Shannon... ...please, don't you think that What? haven't thought about that night 1,000 times? What? mean, what else could What? have done? Oh, yeah. Dodge that guilt. You've outrun this for 25 years. Now it's time to make it up to me. Everyone else has paid their debt. Now it's your turn. Everyone else? Why, why didn't you just kill Jason Hall and leave it at that? What do you mean? Why didn't What? kill him first? What? needed him. What? knew all What? had to do was rattle his little cage and he'd come running to save his precious little Kendra. He took the fall for her, you know that? You and Steven just got lucky. To tell you the truth, at first What? wasn't going to kill him. What? thought maybe he should live. He's faced the music, he's served his time. Then What? realised he was worth so much more to me as a dead-end scapegoat. The cops would think he killed her, then Steven. But now they won't. Oh, but they do, thanks to you. And now that he's dead, well... And the real Alice Evans? Oh. Severe chronic depression can be fatal at times. Which brings us back to you. After you admit to Jason's murder for killing your man and your little BFF, all this will be over. A suicide confession? Not on your life. What about Abbey's life? She has nothing to do with this. You're right, she doesn't. So don't make her suffer. Is she safe? You know, What? actually like her. She's smart, beautiful, in love. Her whole future ahead of her. Just like What? did! Shannon... ...I am so sorry. Too late. You're not going to get away with this. That would be such a cliche if it wasn't so ironic coming from someone who's avoided the noose for so long. What? did nothing to you! What? wasn't driving! Do what What? say, or What? shoot you like What? shot your man! And then What? kill Abbey. No. Then What? disappear. I've become someone new before, What? can do it again. SIREN WAILS JUDY SNARLS GRUNTING SHANNON GRUNTS No! Where's my daughter?! SHANNON SNARLS SHANNON SCREAMS Abbey! Abbey! You two, go with her! Dispatch, this is Deputy Tyson. What? need an ambulance. Abbey! Abbey. honey! Abbey! Abbey! MUFFLED SOBBING Abbey! Oh, my God, Abbey! SOBBING It's OK, it's OK! It's OK! Are you OK? Yeah. Are you OK? Are you OK? SOBBING Get her out of these! Right away. It's all right. POLICE RADIO CHATTER We just got on with the rest of our lives. And then a day becomes a month, and a month becomes a year, and... You kept your secret the whole time What? prosecuted him. What? spoke to him during the trial, and What? told him that What? wanted to confess, but he said that he didn't want me to - it wouldn't help him, and it would only hurt the rest of us. And he'd already ruined so many lives... But he was right. He was right. Was he? He was. Thanks. Hey. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
