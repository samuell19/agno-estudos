Touch wood. FEI' YING GAl WAAK PROJECT FLYING EAGLE I'm just looking. Putting it back now. For me? You're giving this to me?! For me? For real? This one too? Nah... Keep that one for yourself. See this? A water bottle! For when I'm in a pinch! Buddy! Stealing gems is one thing, but you had to drink the holy water? This is holy water? Do you know what happens when you drink the holy water? Hey, it"s not poisoned, is it? Well, it's not poisoned... But you've gotta be her husband now. Having a drink of water is worse than stealing gems?! I used to be even bigger than you! Don't run away! If you go, who'll take my place...?! Hurry up and catch him! Bring him back to me...! Hey...! The gems are here! If you take me with you, I'll give you the gems...! All for nothing! No, no! Wrap it up... Wrap it up! Looks like my holiday's cut short again... Feel free to browse. - Japanese? - Yes. Mister...? I want you to do me a favour... Is that alright...”? Of course. I'll buy something from you. That's not it...! I need to go to the toilet. If it's OK, can you mind my stall for a bit? - Sure, go on ahead. - Thank you very much! I'll be back real soon! Feel free to browse, miss. These wooden figurines are very cute. Are they from Africa? Africa?! And I thought they were Japanese. You don't know what you're selling, but you do know the prices, right? Prices...? 1000 pesetas. What's that? 500, then! That's a pretty good deal. Hey, there must be something fishy about the figurine she's holding. No, wait. It's the money that's fishy! - Thanks. - Thank you. Hey! Stealing money?! - Hey! Forced currency exchange? - You got the official rate. I don't like exchanging with you! - There's nothing to the banknote. - Follow her. Hey-- Come back here! Hey! - I want my one back! - Here, I'll make it up to you. Let's go! Two for one, now that's about right. - Thank you very much! - I did some business for you. It's so much! - This half note is...? - That guy said he had no change. How many did you sell? -I sold the one here in the middle. - Thank you. So, where are these figurines from? They're made by my friends in Africa. I want to buy this one. - Sorry, but something's come up. - Hey! A present for you. Thanks a lot! Hey! Carjacking? Hold it! Stop fighting! Jackie, I was sent here by the earl. - How's it going, Earl? --Welcome, Jackie! How were the sights of the Amazon? Not bad. The people were also very hospitable. Well, good people are welcome anywhere. Now, let us sit down and have some tea first. Earl, did you really ask me to come all this way just to treat me to tea? Alright, Jackie... Regarding the Second World War... how much do you know about it? I just know we shouldn't have a third one. In the latter part of the Second World War, during the German retreat from Africa, one of the military commands received a high-level order. They were to take the gold seized in Europe by the Wehrmacht, and bury it inside a secret military base in Africa. The one in command of the mission was a Herr von Ketterling. He assigned the mission to his adjutant. His adjutant led 18 elite bodyguards to carry out the task. However, the adjutant and his 18 bodyguards, upon completion of the mission, vanished without a trace. What's this got to do with me? Well... The United Nations has commissioned me to look for the gold. As the gold was plundered by the Germans from their occupied territories, there's a chance that many different nations will try and lay claim to it. Under such delicate circumstances, I feel that having an Asian carry out this mission unofficially will help to avoid any potentially embarrassing situations. This is why I have asked you to come here. Allow me to make the introductions. - Colonel Bird, this here is Condor. - Pleased to meet you. - Lieutenant Colonel Banner. - Pleased to meet you. This here is Ada. How do you do? Ada is Professor Bosch's finest pupil. She is especially knowledgable about desert environments. With her as your guide, you will find your target with very little trouble. Did you say she's taking me into the desert? It seems you don't have much confidence in me. That's not what I mean. In everything I do, I always expect the worst and hope for the best. In everything you do, with sufficient knowledge, planning and preparation, as well as the ability to improvise, there is absolutely no need to leave anything to chance. Sounds good in theory, but experience says there's something called 'accidents'. I even plan ahead for accidents. Of course, 'accidents' can be used as an excuse by some failures. To work with somebody with so much confidence makes me very happy. The pair of you are truly two of a kind. Colonel Bird, please show Mr Condor the key to the base. The key to the base will be under the earl's protection for the time being. The gold's been buried for 40-odd years, will it still be there? The key's been under govt protection the whole time. Nobody can get in. - Rest assured. - Don't forget that grave robbers didn't need a key to get into Pharaoh's pyramid. The existence of the base is a top military secret. Not anybody will able to just find it. Oh, right! -I have one last thing I need to ask. - What is it? On this mission, I'm supposedly working in co-operation with Mr Condor. But if we have any disagreements, who should have the final say? What do you think? I'm happy with whatever. I guess I'll be calling the shots, then? Meet me at the Royal Library tomorrow morning at ten. - Tomorrow morning I want to g-- - Wait... I'm calling the shots, remember? Tomorrow morning at ten. I still have some business with the two of them. I'll be going now. Very well. -I will see you again when they depart. - Fine. I'll see you tomorrow morning, then. Goodbye. I've already prepared the data. Eating a lemon every now and then can be quite refreshing! I think so, too. What do you know about the desert? - There's probably a lot of sand? - Wrong. Of the entire Sahara Desert, only a quarter is covered in sand. The temperature in the day will be as hot as 60 degrees Celsius. Nights will be as cold as minus 5 degrees Celsius. There can be no rainfall for years. Normally, a person can survive seven days without food and only water. But two days without water will cause death by dehydration. Are you even listening to me? I am. I was just looking at this photo. That's the adjutant who led 18 bodyguards to bury the gold. According to this... The adjutant has a descendent. Lives around here too. What are you doing? -I wanna go check it out. - There's no point! The German Government already sent people to investigate, but there was nothing. Today"s geography class is over, right? I'm off. Hey! Hey, don't go yet. We still haven't solved the issue of water! Hey! It's only the issue of water! All we gotta do is let the camel loose! A camel can find a source of water within 30 kilometres. If we're relying on a camel to find water, then we're in big trouble. If we're not relying on a camel to find water, then we still have water! This big trouble we're in can't be that big, then! But we still need to solve the issue of water! I've got a good idea! Hong Kong's desalination plant's up for auction. We buy it and take it with us! Is anybody here?! There's a burglar! It's mummy. So it's her?! There was a break-in last night. But don't worry, they didn't take anything in particular. Oh, right! How is our house doing? Is it sold yet? Give me a call back tomorrow. I miss you! Hey, Missy! You better hand over everything your grandfather left behind! Hey! It's us again! Where's the gold? Out with it, or we'll kill you! We"re not kidding around! What total jerks! Let's take a chance! Boyfriend! Who are you?! Get out! Out! Get out! Get out now! Out! Come back here! Help...! Don't be scared! I won't hurt you as long as you keep quiet. What do you want?! I can give you money! I's not money I want, so relax! I'm here thi-- Don't be scared, I'm here to help! - Who are you? --Who are you?! I'm asking you! Me? I'm here to save you. But who are you?! Let me ask him first! Who are you?! Don't move! Move, and I'll shoot! We are the people chosen by God! People chosen by God? Then what are you doing here? Ask her. So you're the ones always harassing me over the phone! You are that adjutant Hans' granddaughter. You must know where the gold is hidden! Did her grandfather steal your gold? Actually, the gold was stolen from the Jews by the Germans in World War Il. So give the gold back to the Jews. But the Jews have taken over our land! We're stealing their gold to call it even! Stop talking! If you're still not gonna tell us, I'll kill you! No... Stop! I'm firmly against the use of violence. We have to use violence. It's a reminder to the entire world to pay attention to our tragic situation! If you resort to violence, then people will think we"re terrorists even more-—- Don't you get it...?! We shouldn't argue in front of other people! Hurry up and tell me where the gold is hidden. If you don't, I'll kill your boyfriend! He's not my boyfriend though! Right! I'm not her boyfriend! So this is none of my business. Don't move! What are you doing here, then?! I saw a 'For Sale' sign downstairs, so I came up to take a peek. Then I heard what sounded like someone taking a shower. So I took a peek since I was already here. I saw absolutely everything! I'm sorry. Do you wanna peek too”?! Don't move! Who else is in your group? How do you plan on stealing the gold? We won't talk! National Liberation Mujahideen won't talk even under penalty of death! Allah demands our existence! Long live the National Liberation Jihad! Save it for next time! Don't mess up this young lady's house. Get lost! And stop harassing this young lady! We will never give up! Justice is on our side! Couldn't you have done something other than tear off my towel?! That was the most effective though. Good morning, Mr Andres. Good morning. I have a friend who says you are Europe's most revered locksmith. -I want you to have a look at this key. - Of course, let me have a look. Are you able to work out what the lock is like from the key's appearance? I can only discern one aspect of the lock from the shape of the key. Now, there are three sections to this key. Some of the sections are insulated. That is, when the lock is opened, it might trigger some kind of electronic device. And from the way it's been designed, the handle must also have its own use. Then there's a trick mechanism? It also needs to be combined with a code. Furthermore, the code can also be changed every time the lock is closed. Then that means only the last person who locked the door knows it. Come see me again if you cannot open it. Sure. Thank you very much. What are you do-- Why are you following me? Empty your pockets. Hurry it up! Not these. The key! Hey. Hey. Get outta the way! - It's him! - Move the car! Get him...! Outta the way! Outta the way...! Step on it! He's behind you! Over there...! Over there...! Make way! Make way! - Careful! The painting's really expensive! - Yeah... Yeah... Hey, be careful...! The painting goes on auction tomorrow...! - Hey, my painting...! - Shit! What do we do now?! Hey, why'd you snatch my paint?! You bastard! Take one more! Faster...! Up front! Oh, no... My baby! Let go of me! I need to save my baby! Help...! Help! My baby's in the middle of the road...! Help...! Baby...! Don't go...! Your son! Baby... Arseholes...! He's over there! Run him over...! Stop him! Stop him...! Hey...! Help me up...! Your reward this time is 1% of the entire gold stash. - That's nothing... - It's not nothing. The entire gold stash is 240 tonnes. 1% is already 2.5 tonnes. Don't know if I'll live to enjoy it though. They're already going all out against me. - Someone with a score to settle perhaps? - No way! They've said outright they're after the key. You didn't think I invited you to Africa to look at lions and tigers, did you? Please excuse me. Do you have some new info for me? I've thought about it. I've decided to go to the desert with you. - And this is...? - She's the adjutant's granddaughter, Elsa. - Such a beautiful young lady. - How do you do? I really want to find out the truth behind my grandfather's disappearance. Let me come with you. Please? - Definitely not a problem! - I have a bad feeling about this. We're not going on a 7-day African safari. Besides, this young lady's relationship with the adjutant is so close, ... I don't believe my grandfather hid away because he wanted to steal the gold. I need to prove it to you! Take me with you! I'll be responsible for her, then. But we already decided that if we disagree, I'm the one calling the shots. Perhaps this young lady will prove useful in our mission. I will decide this time-- you should go together. Very well, then. I'm truly grateful to you. I'll leave my car here, then. Thank you very much. I wish you the best of luck. On a long, long trip together When we're in this together The long journey will reveal itself With the wind between every breath Rush into the embrace of the golden light My passion pours out when I open my heart On a long, long trip together Within the light of the blazing sun We"ll seek out a new path to take -“HEY! WHAT'S WRONG?!” - On our happy expedition -“THE WATER'S LEAKING!” - We're light-hearted as light hearts can be Our laughter, heard across the earth, is the best! Rise, rise, rise, we'll rise as condors soaring the endless skies together You, you, you, you and I together fly, fly, fly, fly up, soaring high! We'll watch the crimson sun from afar within the golden light Being bathed in its light is also the best! As we walk on all the different roads of the world We'll overcome all obstacles in our way! We'll greet every happiness and beauty By surpassing fate itself! I pour out my adoration in the yellow sand - The blessings of Allah be upon you! - We are thankful for your one true God! - My guests! _Hey__ - The food tonight is good, no? - Not bad. - How come you do not eat? - We only just started. Come, sit with us. Any good recommendations? Allow me tell you a story. According to legend, 40 years ago, German soldiers buried 200 tonnes of gold in a military base deep within the Sahara. Where did you hear this story from? All who dwell in the desert have heard this legend. But this gold has never been found by anyone... Only because there has never been a good map! Now, you three are in luck. You have come to the right place. You have come across the right person. My papa traded a bottle of water for this map from a German in the desert. - Sell it to me, boss! - Of course! - How much? - Only 100 American dollars. First make contact with... a Swiss bank, SO you have somewhere to put the 200 tonnes of gold. I will take my leave now. Please enjoy your food. Good luck to you all. Do you think this map will be useful? For sure! If it wasn't useful, why did everyone else here buy one? C'mon! - C"mon, let me seel! - It's kinda curious up close. -I wonder if it's real or fake. - They're the same! I knew he was lying to me. Doesn't matter. Besides, the bottle is pretty nice. Where do you think the real map is? You're actually pretty curious... Maybe the soldiers who buried the gold back then also hid the map as well. But they've disappeared for so long now, there's a chance they're already dead. Disappeared and dead are two different things. If they're not dead, then why haven"t they reappeared? Perhaps they want to take all the gold in secret. So you're saying they're colluding to take the gold for themselves? I have no idea. Some of them could be working together. Some could just be acting on their own. Or maybe some are getting help from their relatives. So you're implying that I'm a spy for my grandfather, is that it?! I never said anything like that. From the moment we met, you've thought of me as some kind of villain! Well, if that's how you really feel, then I'm very sorry. Hey, can the two of you not argue in public? It doesn't look good with everyone watching. Is the food not to your liking? Why do you not eat? You haven't even touched your food! I'm not hungry. I think I'm gonna get going. - Well? - The bill, please. You can clear the table. - You're really not eating? - We"re not eating. If you're not eating, let's not waste it. Take it over to them. Hey, we came here together, so why does it have to be like this? You came together with her. I didn't come with her. I'm heading back now. - It's here! It's here! - Hey. - The food's here, come quickly. - It's 100 dollars a bottle! - It's here! C"mon! - It's here! Don't they look happy? There's a lot of people always chasing fame and fortune in this world. But for them, happiness is getting to eat. That's right. For them, happiness is having a full belly. - And for you? - Money! You're too kind! - What is it? - Come in here. Good night, then. - Is anything missing? - I don't know! Oh, no... my tape is ruined... - What is it? - Take a look at my room. It's been ransacked! Just look at the mess they"ve made! Luckily, the key's been on my body the whole time. Why haven't you kept these on your body, then? Who did this? That's a good question. Weren't you the first to come up? Didn't you see anything? So you"re implying I'm the one who did this??! Those are your own words. I never said anything of the sort. They went through my bags too! Even girls can cry wolf. Alright, fine. You can rummage through my bags, then! Obviously, you haven't gotten what you want. Otherwise, why keep up this innocent act? You're gonna say I was in the wrong now. That I shouldn't give her a hard time. Can't I be more cautious though?! You're right! I've told you to be more cautious. You're not wrong. Good night. What is it? The room you're in is kind of small. Come sleep over in my room tonight. But... remember to bring a sleeping bag. My room isn't that big, but there's space for three to spare. - Hey. - Aren't you used to big rooms by yourself? I don't think African vampires mess with Chinese women anyway. Why rush off over someone like her? I'll go over there and a few words from me will sort her out. - You good yet? Go up first. - I'm good. I'm good. Hey! Hey! You're stepping on my hand! Get down! Hey! If you scold her, we'll all be miserable, then. So clumsy! Just go up! Worse than ploughing the fields and treading the water wheel in the country. Don't scold her, just try and convince her. Sure thing. Lock the door. I'll be back soon. I will. You better not run out on me now! I'll beat you to death! Beat you to death! Where do you think you're going?! Running away, huh?! Had enough?! - Hey! - It's you?! Yeah...! I know you've wanted to beat me up for ages now! You blind, confused fly... Look clearly before you hit someone! That's right! I've wanted to beat you up for ages now! And I looked very clearly before I made my move! Friends of yours? Search her bags. Again?! I only just put everything back too... - Here. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, sure. Thank you. What is it? Go away! Scram! Scram...! I won't disturb you. Let me know if you need anything else. Why are you here?! I don't want to see you! Go away! Hurry up and get lost! Why do you have to treat me like this? There's no reason! Just go already! Don't come in! Jackie's busy! You said you'd try and talk to her. I haven't had time to talk to her yet. We've got something we need to do. Go back now. Something you need to do...? What do the two of you need to do? What is this? Look how I'm dressed-- what else are we doing??! - Just what's going on here?! - Hey...! Go away, we can't wait anymore. Go away... You still don't get it...? You're really gross! Piss off...! Take it out now! Don't play dumb. Where's the stuff? Where what is where? Stop it! Don't hurt him! If you want something, just say it. The Bohgeh'lohgeh map and key. You just want the map and the key, right? I don't have either of those things. - Stop hitting him... - You better tell us... Or we'll kill him! Even if you kill him, I still won't know anything! Stop! Stop... Stop hitting me... Don't just beat me up. Try beating her as well! Maybe [I'll feel sorry for her, and spill everything... Fine! I'll tell you! It's inside his underwear! Do either of you believe her? If you keep stalling, I'll take off your towel! Did you hear that?! He said he"ll take off my towel...! - Great...! - What?! I've wanted to see for a long time now. Jackie, he's taking it off-- - Don't move! - Don't move', apparently. Open wide! Don't move! Come in! C'mon... What is it? It's baked chicken. Baked chicken! B-baked chicken... It was especially made...! Baked chicken! It's free of charge, mister. Please enjoy your meal... Don't move! Don't move! Move, and I'll shoot! The best! The best! You really are the best! I knew you could do it...! Oh, yeah! Clever girl. You knew to come back for us! You got me when my face was all yeehah yeehah? Of course I got it! I gotta stay on my toes, you know...?! Good job! That's for taking off my towel-- I'm starting to like you. I'm starting to like you too! Shoot 'em. Jackie, what are you doing? Why'd you stick on so many bandages? I was afraid the gun would fall out... - Get over there! - I'm so terribly sorry... - Il told you not to come back! - We don't wanna hurt anyone. But we won't mind doing it either. Hand over the map and the key, now! But I really don't have it! You've even searched the room already! Does it look like I'm lying? Well, it's not my fault if you don't believe me. Even if you kill us all, we still won't have it. Right? Enough with the games. 'M gonna count to three. If nobody talks, I'll kill you all, one by one! Why were you busy gawking?! - Why'd you tear off my towel?! - I knew what she was up to. - Hey, why'd you hit me?! - Your fault for looking! They were looking too, why don't you hit them?! - You...! - Stop wasting time! Start with her! Me first?! One. Are we talking? Two. Well?! Three! Hold it! I'll talk. - You're really gonna tell them? - You're the one who told me to. But it's pointless anyway. My two brothers are waiting outside. You won't get away. Really? You don't believe me? Brothers, you can come out now! Catch...! Don't let go, no matter what! Don't... Don't move! I've got the bullets! - Take it! - Here! Back to you! It's still got one bullet left! Ada, where are you going?! I'll protect everything and go first! But where are you going...?! Robbery...! What about me, then?! Knock him out! I've been robbed! Come out and help...! Please help! He's stolen my things...! Everyone, please! Someone stop him...! Robbery...! I've been robbed! Don't just stand there and watch! Coming through! Coming through! Coming through! He's getting away! Someone, please stop him! That's him...! - Well? - Outta the way! Outta the way! Help...! Hey, catch! What's going on? Help...! Somebody's after me...! Please help me stop him...! Someone help me...! He's catching up! All gone! - The key's down there... - I see it! - What's going on? - Robbers! Ada, did you get the key yet?! It's down there! It fell down there! Quick! - Are you alright? Are you hurt? - Hey! Hey! The key's over there! --Go get it! - I know. Hey...! Hurry up and get it! - There's another one coming this way! - Hey... Hey... He's coming! I can't do anything if I'm stuck! I'll do it. So clumsy! Hey, don't come down! You hold on tight and don't move! - Leave it to me. - It's gonna collapse...! Are you alright...?! Do you want your towel back...?! - You OK...? Are you hurt? - I'm fine. Stay close to me! - Look up! - I know, I know, I know... - Where's the key?! - It"s over there... Never fear! I'm here! Where are the robbers?! They're over there! There, it's those two. Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! My friends are down there. Here! We have a deal! All yours! - What?! - I've sold you the last one! Stay close! Powerful enough for ya...? It's over? It's all wrecked... It's all busted! - Let's go back to the room first! - OK. Hey, where're you going?! I'm going this way, which way are you going?? That way... Left foot! Let's move! Get over there now and clean it up! Welcome! The blessings of Allah be upon you! How many rooms do you want to rent? There was a group of people led by a Chinese guy here last night. Where are they now?! Without money, I have no mood for talking. I remember! They already left early this morning! - Where'd they go?! - Into the desert, apparently! Forget him! Let's go! Allah will punish you... It really is a small world. To think we'd run into her again out here. Momoko, you said you've come to the desert to find the meaning of death, but why? We possess life but eventually die anyway, so I'm here in the desert to find out why. Sounds about right... The desert truly is the place closest to death. Are you guys speaking some kind of desert language? Jackie, do you understand what they're talking about? Usually, if you don"t get it, I won't really get it either. I only know that both water and life are very precious. - Don't waste it. - That's true... And not only that, you also have to take good care of your skin. I'm most afraid of my skin drying out from all the sun. What are you doing? Scorpion...! Hey! Hey! Hey...! There's nothing... It's gone! Take a look at yourself! How can you be a man if you're scared of a scorpion? - The scorpion's on your back! - Help...! Shit! There's a scorpion! What should I do? It's crawled onto me somewhere... Please, quickly get someone to save me! I'm really screwed this time! Hurry up and catch it! Get help! Hurry...! - Where'd it go?! I can't find it! - Momoko, be careful! It's poisonous! Don't worry, it's mine. Where did it crawl to...? I'm shaking everywhere but still don"t see it... His name is Ding Dong. I keep him as a pet. As long as you leave him alone, he won't bite you. I'm very sorry if he scared you. Tonight... The moonlight's pretty good. I"m going to bed. Attack...! Don't move! What's going on?! Help...! - Help...! - Hurry up and save me...! Halt! Unbelievable... How dare you lay a hand on me?! Fetch me the gun. - Let go of me, now...! - Bitch, I'll beat you! Let go of me...! Hand it over. - What kind of scorpion is this? - It could be the scorpion king. I'll send you off with a bullet, then. We"re leaving! Take the cars! Quickly now! Hey, the bandits are all gone. Are you alright?! Are you hurt?! I'm fine. My Ding Dong...! - Not so hard! - Are you guys alright? We are fine, but John has it bad. Who were those people? They are desert bandits. Take me to them as soon as it's light. No! We do not want to anger them! I'll take you to them. I'm pretty familiar with this area. But I have to bury... my Ding Dong first. Of course. It's so busy! It's like a market. It is a market. They're here to buy slaves. It starts at sundown. We'll wait till nightfall to make our move. Stop! Stop! What is it? - Hey, I'm off to take a piss. - You better make it quick! Stay right there. C'mon. Stop! Going once...! Going twice...! Going three times...! Sold...! And now for the climax of tonight's auction! - We have two beauties... - Here's the rope. - Go keep an eye out. -...the finest quality. This is Aryan Golden Pussy! This is Oriental Wild Kitty! This is an opportunity not to be missed. We do not come by such rare objects every day! Gold Pussy: Big bottom, full of vitality! Don't touch me! This one, shimmering skin, smooth to touch. Starting bid is ten camels! --15 camels...! - We are on 15 camels! - Do we have 16... -20 camels...! 20 camels! Hey! You know how to drive? - I only just learnt up to third gear. - Third gear? Third gear should be enough. Someone's coming! Who are you people? I"m sorry! - Do we have more than 45 camels?! - Even crying is pointless. -50 camels...! - Can I pick? They're all so ugly! How come the uglier they are, the more camels they have? -60 camels...! -60 camels...! 65 camels...! -65 camels...! - You can have "em! This chieftain bidding 65 camels! Do we have more than 65 camels? Do we...?! 65, going once...! 65, going twice...! -65 camels! -70...1 70 camels...! 70 camels! That chieftain bidding 70 camels! - Anything higher than 70 camels?! -75...! -75...1 -80...! 80...! -85...! -85 camels...! -90...! -90...! -95...1 -95...1 -100...! --100 camels...! -105... --105 camels...! 110! 115! 120! . -125! 21! 1251130! -130...1 -1560...1 -150! That chieftain has bid 150 camels! - Forget it! - Get in early next time! -150 camels...! Hey, what tribe is that chieftain from? He's got so many camels! Any more?! 150, going once! 150, going twice! 150, going three times! Sold! Chieftain, come up and collect your goods! Put it in first gear. Step on the gas. Momoko, calm down! Truly shimmering skin, and smooth to touch. Me like! It's Jackie! I'm here to rescue you. Wild kitty! Pretty! Pretty! Pretty! Pretty! - Gold Pussy! - Hey, this chieftain's a catch! Husband material! - No! Stay back! Don't touch me! - Me like! Thief...! - What happened?! - Someone stole my clothes! - Who stole your clothes? - It's Jackie! He stole my clothes! This chieftain's an imposter! Get him...! Cmon! Get down now! Sorry! Are you alright?! Start the ignition. Put it in first gear. Don't move! Step on the gas. The hand brake! C'mon! - Go find out what's going on! - Aye! Crmon! Cmon! C'mon! That"s not Ada...! Help...! Be quiet! - Good job! The car's outside. Go! - I'm over here! Where are you going?! C'mon! C"mon! Hurry! Hurry! C"mon...! Over here...! - Hey, stop the car! Hey...! - Wait for me...! - H-hey! It's really bumpy! Hey! - Hey, Momoko! What's wrong with you?! - Why'd you pick a road like this?! - Hey! Did you really learn how to drive?! Get your arse off the gear stick...! - You're crushing me...! - Hey! Turn! Turn...! Praise be to Allah for delivering you to us...! Take us to the Bohgeh'lohgeh Base! Hey, let's stop for a bit... I'm parched! Please give me some water to drink... Please. Give them some water. - Hey, he wants us to give them water. - They're not getting any! Idiot! Look after yourself first! I beg you... Take it easy! If we're gonna die... we'll die together. You stupid bitch, you played us! You've led us to the wrong place! Even the sun's in the opposite direction! Hey, you've been reading the map upside down! Let me have a closer look. C"mon, let me give you a hug. You'll feel better. Drink! Hey, hey, hey! Be careful! Don't blow our cover. Enough. Enough. We've hugged enough. C'mon! Let me hug you too. You"ll feel better. I haven't had enough hugs...! So thirsty, but still so affectionate. It makes me sick... C'mon, let me hug you. Water! Take your time! Slow down. Turns out being thirsty also makes you horny! Let me hug you a bit longer... Are you guys running a fever? My turn to hug... Hey, that's enough. Enough. That's enough. You don't have to make faces at me. I don't need your hugs. If you let me hug you, you'll understand. Hey, look. Hug me some more...! Don't come near me...! - C'mon, let me hug you. - Don't come near me, please! I hate all this lovey-dovey hugging and kissing stuff... - Let me hug you! - Go and hug them, not me. My pants are coming off-- Help...! You'll feel better too if I give you a hug! Hey! Hey! Don't be like that! Hey! You'll blow our cover! Hey! Don't hold me so tight...! Hey! Hey! What do you think they're up to? Hey, stop that... Get your hands and legs off me! Our cover's gonna get blown! Hey! - Get your hands off me! - It's my turn! Hug me...! - Stop it! Hey! Our cover's gonna blow! - Just a bit longer...! Hey, don't come at all once or they'll see us! More hugs...! Leave some for me! They got us! Give it here! Any more funny business, and I'll kill the lot of you! Let's go! Why'd you have to fight over it?! Now we've lost the last of the water... Move it! Move it! Why are you still sitting there? Move! Hey, Aman! According to the map, this should be the place! There's so much sand! Even if we dig, it'll take forever! Are you reading it right? Read it yourself if you don't believe me! Let me see the map. Let them see it! Give it to me. Hand me the compass. I's adjustable! It should be right here! The sandstorms around here are the most severe. The base might be buried beneath the sands already. You're not telling me this is it, are you? I am! This is the correct bearing on the map! Maps can be wrong too! This is a military map, it's very accurate! The margin of error is only three kilometres. What? Three kilometres?! Even a taxi metre's gonna jump up a few dozen times! Allah...! Please give us a sign...! - Aman?! - Don't move! Aman...?! Give them some water. - Here. - I don't ever wanna see you again...! - Thank you! Thank you! - Thanks?! That water's ours! Let's go! You won't get away with this...! Allah will punish you...! Stay back! I've never experienced such failure... First time for everything. Are these photos yours? They're my grandfather's. I've been to this place before. The people from this tribe know me. It's only them who worship this god. I bought this figurine because it looks like the idol in the photo. Jackie, take a look at this. From the looks of it, the photo must've been taken near the base. Then hurry up and take us there! We haven't failed yet! The sandstorms here are really strong. What you see here today, might be covered by the sands tomorrow. Then I'll take another photo so we can find it easily in the future. Don't go in there! This place has been taken over by a vicious tribe of natives. We've never seen any bona fide vicious people before! Right, Jackie? Why are you even doing this? Well, why do you risk your life to come to the desert by yourself? I've brought a lot of medicine that's beneficial to the natives here. If we can find what we've been looking for, it'll be beneficial to many people. Right? - She can argue the dead back to life. - Then quit yapping and let's go inside! - Thank you very much. - Be careful! Thank you for bringing us here. Hey, what are you up to? Checking if it's hollow! Hey...! Hey, there's a path down here. C'mon! Let me wait for you. Slow down. It's really dark in here. Take your sunglasses off! Alright... The two of you check down there. I'm gonna go up here. Be careful now. Hey, you're done already?! All done. C'mon... A head...! Why are you so nervous? I's an ox head, not a human head. - What's with you? - Something flew by...? What flew by? A human head...! - What's going on? - Run! Run! There's someone over there! - There's someone there! What now?! - This way! Hurry! - Where are you going?! - QOutta the way! C'mon. Hey, one at a time! Hey! Hey! Hey! I'm falling... - QOver there! - Take that! - We're just tourists! --We're tourists... It works-- take another one! Go! Still taking photos...? Go already! It's a dead end! So what now, huh?! - Take one each. - What for?! Quickly, run! Knock! Knock! I can't knock him out! Of course he's still up-- you're not hitting hard enough! Hit him now! Seen this before?! Hey, this dancing of theirs... It's a way of making peace with enemies to foster allies. Yes... Yes... There are tribes in Africa like this. Let's follow their dancing. Left foot first. You can stop dancing. This is actually a cavalry call. What now, then? Everyone for themselves. - There's a lot of sheep and ox skulls! - Jump over them! Crmon! Cmon! C'mon! They've stopped following us. It's not worth sticking around even if there's diamonds to pick up! C"mon! - Are they calling the cavalry again? - Why would they? I's already like all the king's horses over there! - What are you doing? - Save me...! I'm sinking...! Jackie, where've you gone...?! Just stay where you are...! We"re almost there...! I haven't moved. Come find me! - What is this place...?! - I don't know either...! What is that? - A leg, I think. - What...? What's wrong...?! Nothing! Nothing! Stop shouting! - What's going on? I'm really scared...! - Don't be scared...! - What is it now...?! - Just words. Take a look for yourself. Can you hear me?! Get over here! I'm scared...! - Hey, wait for me! - Coming! Coming! Give me water! Hand it over! That's mine! - What"s that?! Hey, over here! - Yours...? From the looks of it, this seems to be the military base. It must be... A candle! It's really dusty, huh? It's my grandfather...! - Are you sure he's your grandfather? - No, don't move him! - Your grandfather was murdered. - How do you know? Take a look. --You...! - I'm sorry. You really recognise him? Yeah... Don't be sad. He's been dead for so long now. I'm sad because now I know my grandfather was actually murdered. What is that? A journal. Hey, don't touch me with those hands! Let's see what's inside. This journal actually belonged to my grandfather! Did he leave any last words? See if it says who killed him. Today we covered 20 km, but four of my fellows suffered heatstroke-- Flip to another day! Seems the war does not bode well for my side. However, I truly believe the marshal will lead us to a final victory. Moreover, our commander General Rommel is an unparalleled military genius... Is there anything more significant? A large amount of immensely heavy metal was shipped here today. The Herr has ordered me to move it into laboratory no. 1 immediately. What kind of metal has such a weight? It must be gold! - We've gotten to the gold! - The Herr has given me 18 pills. Each man is required to take one after we have finished moving the gold. He also told me that a code is required to lock down the base. - I shall use Eliza's birthday. - Who is Eliza? She's my mummy. Do you remember her birthday? I do, but why did my grandfather have to meet such a tragic end? - Keep reading, then... - I know why. If my hunch is right, these are all your grandfather's bodyguards. After they had completed their mission, your grandfather had them take poison. No wonder your grandfather was so sad. He had to kill all 18 of his comrades at once. Strange... There's 15 here. The two upstairs make 17. There's one missing. Where's the last one, then?! Because one of the bodyguards was very smart, he did not take your grandfather's poison. - Are you alright? - Who is that? If 've guessed correctly... Your name is Adolf! How do you know this? Your name is engraved on the knife. You are that one smart bodyguard! You didn't take the poison! So you're the one who murdered my grandfather! Your grandfather was never a good man! He tricked us into taking poison. He saw that I did not take the poison... So he crippled my leg! How I have long waited... for this day. But the rights to the gold belong to the United Nations! As long as the gold... remains in this place... I am the master of the gold! You can talk after we've found the gold. Which way should we go? I recall you have to go out from there. Hey...! You four go first! And no funny business, kid! Hey, who are all these other people? Mercenaries. They work for me. They only work for money! - Move! - Hey... How about we give them more money and have them work for us? I'm just afraid they'll take your share ilNn the end as well! Stop causing trouble. Move! Move it...! Go! Go! Hey, this way! This way! This way! This way! Hurry up! Down here. Down here. Quickly... What is it? There is a generator over there-- have someone start it! Ben, go and start it. Everyone else, stay in pursuit! Mind your fire! Hurry up... C'mon! C'mon! - Hey! They're over there! - Get them! Go down and search! Hurry up! - They're over there...! - C'mon, ¢'mon! Let's go, quickly! Mind your fire! It's full of ammunition down there-- it's very dangerous! Watch where you're shooting! They can't get away! Let's go! - What now? - Go inside! - Where are we going...?! - How should I know...? Hey, let's move! C'mon. Hide over there for now. Hurry! - They've gone inside! - Follow them! Split up and find them! Hey, be careful...! Hey...! Over there! Over there! Go check it out! Hold your fire! It will not work-- this door is impenetrable! You can climb through using the ventilation shaft above! Have someone climb through now! You heard him. I'm going in. Try it again! The lights are definitely staying off. The lights are staying off. - They found us...! - Jackie, where are you...?! We"re still missing one. Oh, shit... Oh, shit... The lights are staying off. He won't get away when the lights are on. Almost there! Almost there! Faster! Faster! They're turning on! They're turning on! Don't move! Move, and I'll shoot! Hands on your heads! Stand aside! You did it! - Stand over there! - You're really something! - Ada, throw away the guns. - Yep, yep, yep! Be careful, they're really dangerous. Where should we put them? I'll grab some rope to tie 'em up with. - If they move, shoot! - Right! Don't move! I'll shoot! Don't do anything rash... She really will shoot! - Don't move! - Watch out! Why are you so clumsy?! D-don't move! There's no point calling me! Attack! Everyone take care of themselves...! I'm really scared! I'm real busy here... Now what?! We'll take you on! - Pull him down! Pull him down! - Pull it down! Bash him! Bash him! Harder...! Take the stairs up! We'll go again... - Alright... - Alright... After him...! Hey! Stop him! Don't let him get away...! - We'll go again...! - Go again... Alright! - What now? - It's closer over there! H-help me... - Pull me back up! - Here. Now... Playing dirty?! In the middle! And one more on me! - Is he out yet? - Pretty much. Let's go over and help. Get him! We-- Open the door! - Check if my hand is OK. - It's fine! Stupid bitch... I didn't even hit you yet. Hey. You! Give me the key. Are you OK? Hey! You better think it through! I'm the only one who knows how to use this key! My grandfather used my mum's birthday as the code. I'm the only one here who knows my mum's birthday! I'm the only one who knows the unlocking procedure! - Is it this complicated? - Possibly. We should find the gold first. - Which way from here? - There is a tunnel further down that way. Fine. We go that way. Condor, you first! We leave... Go open the door. What's the code? The key has three sections, with a different code for each. My mama's birthday is the 16th of September... - Nine-One-Six. - Got it. I have waited 40 years for this day... Fucking kid, you lied to me... You want me dead?! I really didn't lie! That's right! I've told you absolutely everything I know! My mama's birthday really is the 16th of September! Is there something you may have forgotten?! Cut the crap! You open it! Hey, did you remember your mum's birthday wrong? No! It really is the 16th of September. Hey, Chinese or Gregorian...? Why would white people use the Chinese calendar? There, right here in grandfather's journal: - I shall use Eliza's birthday. Should 1?7 -“Should I” means he wasn't sure! Would your grandfather have used your birthday? - Then let's try my birthday. - Try...?2! - What"s that? - Grandfather's necklace! - Could that be it? - Then what about this side? Which one is it, then?! Six-Nine-Eight? Those bullets can shoot through ten people. The first number is six. Six. Nine. Nine! You're really annoying. Get your hands off me! Eight. Eight! Hey... why isn't it opening? What is that? What is it...? And from the way it's been designed, the handle must also have its own use. Now what? I'm scared... I'm really scared! It's OK... It's OK... Yuen, give him a hand. Why's the base so small? Hey, you said the gold would be here! This is just the elevator, buffoon. Hey, we're going in! Let's check it out. Uncover that canvas! Now! Now! Now! Now! The canvas up there...! Right. Gold... There really is that much gold... And 2.5 tonnes of it is mine... - We're rich...! --We're rich...! Push me inside. Push me inside! As if they'd still listen to you now. Push me inside! We"re rich...! Don't move! Tell them to drop their guns, or I'll blow your brains out! Did you hear that...?! Drop your guns! Drop your guns...! No...! Come and save me, you buffoon...! Don't call me a buffoon again! Then hurry up and find a way to save me! I'm the one giving the orders now. Don't yell at me. What...? You betray me?! For 240 tonnes of gold, we'll betray anybody. You can kill him if you want, kid. You wanna call my bluff? If you don't drop your guns when I count to three, I'll shoot! One! Two! Three! He won. It makes no difference to us if you kill him or not. There is more gold to be found beyond that tunnel! As long as you spare me, I will gladly help you retrieve it! You've got nothing left up your sleeve from the looks of it. Condor, you're coming with me! Everyone else start moving the gold outside! Right! - Hey! Gimme a hand! - Yeah, stop messing around... Stop messing around. Help 'em move the gold. H-hey! Hey...! What the hell's going on?! - What are we gonna do now?! - Upstairs is a control room. - We should check on Condor and the others. - C'mon, then! Push me upstairs... - Ada, let"s go! This's no time for gawking! - I'm coming! They really are down there! It's too dark in here... Let's get the lights first. Over there! Why aren't they turning on?! They're still not turning on! Dammit! These aren't even switches! - Switches everywhere-- which one is it?! - Why is finding a light switch so hard? They're on! Hit the off switch for the fan first. - Which one is it? - Right, there's so many... Which one? We'll wing it! From bad to worse! - Ada, could it be these switches? - What switches? Hey, I think it's slowed down! Keep him busy. I'll get the door. Why hasn't Adolf gotten up here yet? Do you think Momoko can carry Adolf all by herself? Oh, yeah! Let's go carry him together! Why...? Uh-oh. - Try turning it off-- I can't let go! - Me try?! Alright, then... - How did this happen? - Oh, no...! What should we do, then?! We haven't tried those buttons yet! Hurry! Break it. Break it! - Do not touch those buttons! - But I already did! - Looks like it's stopped! - It has! It has! Of course it stopped. Those buttons... destroy the base! The base will explode after 30 minutes! We are all going to die! Why did you not wait for me to come up...?! Traitor! ! will have you understand how those who betray me come to an end! Jackie, you better come up with something to get us out of this! Stay outta my way, kid, and we'll split the gold two ways! Two ways?! Go open the door! R-right... I will not let any of you slip away... Get the door now! Why are you just standing there?! Hurry up! Didn't you hear me?! I'm OK... and it's pretty fun too! Super Hong Kong Foot...! Why are you dancing? It's gonna explode...! Speak to him through the microphone! Hey, hurry on up here! The base is about to explode...! Explode?! What?! We've got less than 20 minutes! I just wanted to help you... - Elsa told me to press it. - What do we do now? All the exits are now blocked. The only possibility is to blast through the wind tunnel. What's that? Blast through there?! Correct. That is where the walls of the base are the thinnest! Harness the wind! He's coming down! Come help, Momoko! Here, the switch you want! Adolf just refuses to leave! I will not leave here. I should have died 40 years ago. ! want to be together with my old friends. I must stay here in this place. Farewell... He can stay all he wants, but we're leaving! Right! Finish prepping the rope and I'll go shut the door. Time is not on your side! ! will set the turbine to its strongest to send you outside. ! wish you good luck. You done yet? Hurry up! - Hey, leave those ones! - Out of the question! Elsa, can't I just leave these? Of course! But give me a hand and take them for me! - The gold...! - Leave it...! Just... leave... it...! You alright? Go find the others! I'm all shaken up... Are you all OK? Hurry up! It's about to cave in! Let's go! - It collapsed just like that... - Let's go. You cheated death, what more do you want? C'mon. There's still a consolation prize. Thanks be to Allah... for delivering you to us again... Here! There's still one piece of gold! It's all yours! - We don't want gold! We want water...! - I wanna drink water... Here. You can drink it all if there's any left! Turns out people don't really know what it is they actually need. If we actually had any water, you think we'd be struggling like this? Water! Give me water...! Let's call a truce and look for water together. Hey, which way we going...? If my hunch is right, there'll be water past that dune over there. Let's go... Is that true? - Is it closer If we walk that way...? - C"mon...! Listen to the desert expert! Let's go... We've walked over so many dunes, why's there still no water...? - Just one more and we'll see it... - Is that true...? Believe in the words of the desert expert. Just one more dune and we can go swimming if we want! I've said this already, but only a quarter of the desert is covered in sand... Keep moving, it's real close...! Life is hard to bear for the common people Hunger and poverty pervade the world The powerful are unrighteous The wind and sand blocks out the sky Bandits fill the lost city Where does one find a titan of justice to subdue the wickedness? ! hold your hand as we run across the endless rugged roads 1 lift you high up into the sky to be the master of the clouds Never again believe that the powers that be Are furious at all the indiscriminate slaughter! The paths of love and affection Bind and circle the world Who will do it? The perilous mountains, the terrible water The ordinary people Could they be searching for a true paradise to spend the rest of their lives?
