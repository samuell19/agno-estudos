A Daiei Company, Ltd. Production Sandayu, show yourself! In the 9th month of the 9th year of the Tensho period, Oda Nobunaga, with a large army, attacked lga Province. The Ninjas of lga were annihilated, and thus Nobunaga appeared to have accomplished his goal of gaining control overthe entire nation. But was the extermination of the Ninjas really total?

What are you waiting for, hurry up and seal it up. Yes, sir. Nobukatsu... It's been six months since we attacked Koga... and both the Fujibayashiand Momochi fortresses are still in ruins. Yes, sir. It's proof that the Ninjas have been exterminated. We mustn't get complacent. They're as tenacious as vipers. Even when hacked to bits... they can still writhe about! Lord... It's clear spring water. I'll have some. I'll have some. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. One moment... Test for poison. Yes, sir. One moment... Test for poison. One moment... Test for poison. Yes. There is nothing wrong with it. Fool! Enemies! Ninjas! Pursue them! Don't let them get away! Hold it! Go away! Go home! Go home I say! Hey... there's a reward of 10 pieces of siIver for the location of a Ninja hideout... and 30 pieces for capturing a Ninja. Thirty Ninjas have been executed already. Enough is enough, that Nobunaga is a cruel man. Enough is enough, that Nobunaga is a cruel man. Watch what you say! Leave! I said leave! I'm bored of crucifixions. Nobukatsu, any creative ideas for executions? Well, we could bury Ninjas up to their necks... and let the spectators, farmers, and merchants... saw off their necks with a bamboo saw... say one stroke each? One stroke of the saw each... It would take several days for them to die. You've got a talent for cruelty. Hey Ranmaru... I suppose everyone is good at something. Well... "Byo:" a large bale of rice, about 72 liters. 2.5 Byo = 1 koku, the amount of rice needed to feed one man for one year. Announcement: 8,000 byo of rice have been gathered. Ranmaru, attend to it immediately. Yes, sir. What do you intend to do with 8,000 bales of rice? I'm sending them to Makinogahara castle in Enshu. So you are finally attacking Takeda Katsuyori! Please, take me with you. Denied. Your job is to hunt Ninjas. Don't let even one escape. Lord... "Hashiba Chikuzen:" another name for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who controls Chikuzen province. Oh, Chikuzen. "Hashiba Chikuzen:" another name for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who controls Chikuzen province. "Hashiba Chikuzen:" another name for ToyotomiHideyoshi, who controls Chikuzen province. How strange, I was just thinking that I wanted to talk with you. Not strange at all. No matter what distance separates us... your will, my Lord, instantaneously reaches your servant Hideyoshi. Only a bold man would dare to speak to me that way! You're sleeping so soundly. You've been waiting for me without crying. What a good boy. Mom's bringing back some nice baby clothes for you. Be patient. What's going on? Did something happen? Did something happen? They've caught more Ninjas. Get up and walk! Come on! Get up and walk! Get up! Stand aside! Hurry up! Get up and walk! It's yummy food. You're eating yummy food? You're eating yummy food? Let's resolve to move to my home town. What... to Saiga? What... to Saiga? Yes. Maki, I'm not a Ninja any more. I just want the three of us to live a quiet life. So we should go to my brother in Saiga, and become farmers. Oda's officials have no authority in Saiga. I hear that the Ikko-sect rebels of Saiga are causing problems for Nobunaga. Maki... I don't want to get involved again. But what if Oda's men find you? Don't worry about it. The only people who know I'm here are... MomochiSandayu and Yozo, and they're both dead. What is it? Dare to come in, and I'll kill you! Gohei! Make a move and your brat gets it. Gohei! Damn! Help! Drop the axe. Gohei! Shit! Gohei! Gohei! Stop! Let go! Gohei! Gohei! Gohei! The final bastion of the lkko-sect rebels: Kishu, in Saiga. It's devastating... But no matter how much we cry, it won't bring Goheiback. Look at Goemon. He hasn't been with us in Saiga for long, but... he has already become indispensable. He has completely changed. He's devoted himself to teaching the skills of Ninjitsu. Hey, here comes the Bonten-maru. Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu. Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu. Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu. Said Shinran Shonin, with regard to the eviI that is in each of us... it is not that we must suppress our feverish delusions, and become Buddha... but rather, that by steadfast belief in the great compassion of Amitabha, we shall be delivered. These teachings of grace, intended to save all those dwelling under the heavens... Nobunaga seeks to utterly destroy. Nobunaga is an enemy of Buddha. The enemy of Buddha is our enemy. Just as it is said that we should proclaim... the virtues of Amitabha's great compassion in all places and circumstances... then in gratitude for that grace... as members of our community, let us offer up our lives in service. Namu Amida-bu, Namu Amida-bu... Namu Amida-bu, Namu Amida-bu... I understand your feelings all too well... how you ache to see Nobunaga fall. Why do you stop me, then? You are no longer a Ninja of Iga. You're Goemon, of the Ikko sect. That's right. I once believed that human beings only think of their own happiness... but I have learned from the Ikko-sect that one can sacrifice one's own life to save another... and I am humbled by it. "Saiga faction:" last surviving group of the lkko-sect. The Saiga faction cannot permit personal vendettas. And if you faiI, Nobunaga will wreak his vengeance upon the rest of us. Nobunaga has kiIled tens of thousands of people. He has taken my leg, and your son. Would you have us all die as well, in vain? Then when are we going to get Nobunaga? We must wait for the moment when all of our forces, acting as one, can defeat him... Namu Amida-bu, Namu amida-bu. Chief. The Bonten-maru has brought in a shipment of new matchlocks from Tanegashima. Good. They're here. Goemon, our chance will come. Fire! Kansuke... Sir. Here! Goemon, guess who? That's the " heaven-moving" trick. Considering your technique, you must have once visited the Momochigarrison... so you must be the Tokugawa spy, HattoriHanzo. Good job, Goemon, you hit the bullseye. What do you want? I'm surprised you're still alive. On the other hand, you, Goemon, are a hard man to kill. What do you want? We need to talk. I've got nothing to talk about with a man who deserted to the Tokugawa. Calm yourself. I've got something to ask of you. I came all the way from Mikawa to see you. How about a drink? I've sworn off booze untiI I've kiIled Nobunaga. I see. Now that's the Ishikawa Goemon of MomochiGarrison that I know. Sandayu will be able to rest in peace. Sandayu will be able to rest in peace. It's not for Sandayu. UntiI I see Nobunaga dead, with my own eyes, my heart will be fiIled with rage! That's why I'm here. Alas, Nobunaga's on a roll. Everything's going his way. Even his archrival Takeda has now fallen. Even so, Nobunaga continues to hound the survivors of Takeda's clan. He has besieged Erin-jiTemple in Koshu, their last refuge... what?! You failed to capture the Takeda clansmen? Yes, sir. They were guided through the mountains by a monk. Where's the abbot? Where is Abbot Kaisen?! He, along with his monks and the clansmen, have taken refuge in the temple. Set fire to the temple! What are you waiting for?! Burn them all alive! Please reconsider, my Lord. Erin-jiTemple is highly revered by the farmers, and Kaisen is an imperial mentor. We are in new territory now, I implore you to show mercy. Impossible! Ever since you set fire to the Mount HieiTemple a few years ago... your actions have been closely watched, my Lord. You will provoke the people's resentment by executing innocent clergymen and laity. Silence, Mitsuhide! Once you were just a starving ronin. Only 10 years later, you are Lord of Tanba in Koshu, a 600,000 koku fief! All that you have, you owe to me, do you not?! But you would forget your great debt, and dare to question my orders? Hashiba Chikuzen and Takigawa Sakon are worth a hundred of you, in loyalty and in battle... and yet, they've never accused me of inhumanity! You ingrate! I'm sick of looking at your kumquat of a head! My Lord! Get out! Take your soldiers and return to Tanba! Ranmaru, chase them out of here. Yes, sir. Sir Akechi, please stand up. What are you waiting for?! Nobutada, get the fire started! Yes, sir. Abbot Kaisen, along with 60 other people, were burned to death, with no survivors. Are you saying that there's a way to get Nobunaga? There is. AkechiMitsuhide is both a great scholar and a great warrior. He's both loyal and honest, and would never stoop to flattery. In contrast, Nobunaga is inherently boorish, capricious, and wiIlful. They're about as compatible as oiI and water. And Hideyoshiwill only make the breach between them worse. Who cares about Hideyoshi? This is the crux of the matter. Hideyoshihas Nobunaga all figured out. He is a perfect servant, because he can anticipate Nobunaga's every move. The more Nobunaga favors Hideyoshi, the worse Mitsuhide's position becomes. However calm and collected Mitsuhide forces himself to appear... there must be an extraordinary storm brewing inside him. Goemon... You must win Mitsuhide's confidence. And whip that brewing storm into a tempest. You could accomplish your goal without having to hold a weapon. Would that not be the essence of the way of the Ninja? Tamame! Mr. Goemon, it's been a long time. Remember her? She's Yozo's niece. "Kunoichi:" Female Ninja, typically an espionage specialist. Tamame has been in AzuchiCastle for a month now, operating as a kunoichi. She's doing everything she can to disrupt Nobunaga and Mitsuhide. Tamame, I'll reiterate. A kunoichi's weapon is her womanhood. You must seduce your target, but never let your heart be stirred. Understand? Yes. We're done. Return to Azuchiat once. Goodbye, then. On his triumphant return from Koshu, Nobunaga will stop at Suruga. Obviously he intends to parade his forces in front of leyasu. Hamamatsu Castle Your generous hospitality and exceptional security... have greatly impressed me, Lord Tokugawa. Think nothing of it. I, leyasu, depend entirely upon the support of the Minister of the Right. I can never do enough for you in return. In that case, so that I can reciprocate, permit me to invite you to come to Azuchitomorrow. What do you say? Will you come? Yes, sir, by all means, it would be my great pleasure. Hamamatsu Hamamatsu Kameyama My Lord. Leyasu hasn't participated in a single battle, yet he was awarded the Suruga fief. And yet, my Lord... you haven't been given so much as a wave of a sword. It is unbearably unfair. Why must you be so mistreated? As you know, untiI I was 40 years of age, I had no master. Then I met our Lord, and was made the Lord of a 600,000-koku fief. Therefore, I truly believe that I owe my advancement entirely to our Lord. Your advancement is due to your great ability on the battlefield, my Lord. I daresay that a 600,000-koku fief is a paltry reward for that! Kuranosuke... I am now in my 55th year. My time as a military commander will end soon... and I want to end it having remained unwaveringly loyal to our Lord. Excuse me. Ota. Ota. This one's a spy. What? I am not! I was doing my rounds, and saw the light in the tearoom so I went to check it out. Then, all of a sudden, a shuriken was thrown at me. Liar! Liar! Who are you? Just as I thought. Look... My Lord, this a record of all your activities since your return from Koshu. And who are you? Sir... I am one who has no name. We shall investigate you in the morning. Kuranosuke... Don't let this man get away. My Lord, what about this? My Lord! Remove Ota's corpse at once. What is your name? My name is Saheiji. Are you a man of Iga? Nothing so exotic sir, I'm just a farmer's son, from Saiga in Kishu. You're from Saiga? Yes. I got fed up with farm- ing, which holds no hope of advancement. I'll do anything, if it means I can become a samurai. My Lord, please accept me as your vassal. I implore you! Wait untiI I have orders for you. Wait untiI I have orders for you. Am I to become your vassal? Kuranosuke. Kuranosuke. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Add him to your men. Yes, sir. Thank you very much! My Lord. We know nothing of his background, so why would you hire him? I know his background, he's from Iga. This shuriken is of a style used only by the Iga Ninjas. Why did you hire him, knowing that he's a Ninja? Don't you see, Kuranosuke? If I were to turn him down... he'll go around telling others that our Lord has sent people to spy on me. After 15 years of fighting together, it would be bad if people thought he didn't trust me. It would interfere with his plans for the future. My Lord, still you remain loyal, even after he sets spies upon you? Think about how many times he has let you down, my Lord! Please remember! Kuranosuke, no more. Kuranosuke, no more. No, I will speak! I, Kuranosuke, can endure it no longer. Certainly you have not forgotten about our assault on YagamiCastle! In order to arrange negotiations for a surrender, my Lord offered up his own mother as hostage. Even though an agreement had been reached... our Lord executed the castle's Lords when they emerged under a flag of truce. When those within the castle found out... they crucified your mother on the castle tower! That's enough! Your mother was cruelly murdered as you watched, my Lord. And after having sacrificed the woman who gave birth to you... what did our Lord do to reward you? He has constantly favored that upstart Hideyoshi... and even put him in command of the Chugoku expedition! Silence! Silence, I say! But that was not enough. Now he is spying on you! I did not expect Lord Nobunaga to invite me so soon. Tadakatsu, what do you think of this? You never know, it might be a trap. I think you should not go to Azuchi. But it may be a blunder to decline, as it might give Nobunaga reason to suspect treachery. Has Hanzo returned yet? Has Hanzo returned yet? He just got back. Summon him. Summon him. Yes, sir. We cannot justify a large escort when he is seemingly being hospitable. We cannot feign iIlness as an excuse either. My Lord, you received him too warmly, and therein lies the problem. Is that what you think? Well, my warm reception was the result of much calculation. Hanzo. I have just returned. What is your assessment of both Lord Nobunaga and the situation in Azuchi? Yes, sir. He has been in high spirits since his departure from here. When he arrived in Azuchi, he gave merit awards to all his men. Their victory celebration lasted two days. Merchants and farmers say that you, Lord leyasu... gave him an astoundingly warm reception at Suruga. It was the talk of the town. Then there was no flaw in my strategy. My extravagant reception will earn me a 120% return on my investment. Now it will be I who will be entertained in Azuchi, in a hitherto unheard-of way... in the presence of all of Nobunaga's allies. Tadakatsu... Send a message to Lord Nobunaga, that I will be departing at once. Yes, sir. "On the occasion of Lord Tokugawa leyasu's visit to Azuchi... "... you shall lead the reception committee... "...and perform those duties with impeccable decorum."...Oda Nobunaga. Congratulations on your assignment. I appreciate you having undertaken such a long journey. Our Lord remarked that only Mitsuhide would be worthy of such a great responsibility. Is that so? May I ask, where will Lord leyasu be lodging? It has been decided we shall stay at the Taiho Monastery. Taiho would be ideal, as it is both convenient and spacious. All I do is wonder if you're busy today, or perhaps will visit me on the next. It's been like that for the last five days. I'm sorry. I had to inform Lord Akechi... that he had been made the leader of Lord leyasu's reception committee. So I heard. Well, did Lord Akechiaccept? He was quite happy to. But I heard that Lord Akechihas been upset about how his loyalty... was not being recognized, even being scorned, by our Lord. Sir Ranmaru. If I, Tamame, am truly in your heart... then certainly you could make the time to see me. Forgive me... But, Tamame... I, Ranmaru, am in love with you from the bottom of my heart. I love you so much I can't stand it. I can't breathe... I want to squeeze you to death. I'm short of breath... I can't breathe. Sir Ranmaru... Tamame... Sir Ranmaru... I'm so happy! I was worried that you might not come. What if someone sees us here like this, at this hour? I am so sorry. But I could not wait another moment to give this to you. Forgive me. Hey, it's a perfume-pouch. Yes. It's supposed to have been made in Kyoto. Where did you get it? An errand sent me to Taiho Monastery, and it was being sold at a shop on the way. What a nice scent. How are the arrangements coming along at Taiho Monastery? Sir Mitsuhide is in charge, and it's a really big production. The curtains, screens, wares... all are the finest, made by master craftsmen in Kyoto. I heard that chefs of the Shijo Daiso style have been summoned from Kyoto as well. Wow, so he's sparing no effort. However, gossips are spreading false rumors. False rumors? That Sir Mitsuhide is using this assignment as an excuse to curry favor with Lord leyasu. Supposedly, his messengers have already made three round-trips to Hamamatsu. What, three trips, you say?! Sir Mitsuhide... it's just as I suspected. Sir Mitsuhide... it's just as I suspected. I am honored by your visit. You are aware that it is I, Nobunaga, who invited leyasu? Isn't the flower on these screens your family crest? Yes. Regarding the upcoming ceremony... it is traditional to use the crest of the leader of the reception committee. Shut up! Tradition be damned, you know-it-all! Take them down at once! These items are all precious heirlooms of the Akechifamily. Yoshihiro & Kuniyuki: Master swordsmiths. This is a short-sword made by Go-no-Yoshihiro, and a Kuniyukisword. This is calligraphy by Kyodo. All the detaiIs are in this catalog. Those are lavish gifts. My Lord. Mitsuhide! You are being far too generous. What are you expecting in return for these exorbitant gifts? What am I expecting? Absolutely nothing. My only consideration is giving a proper welcome to my Lord's honored guest. Silence! Lord leyasu is of the fourth rank. I, Nobunaga, am the Minister of the Right, second in rank. You've prepared extravagant gifts for a subordinate. Mitsuhide, you are playing a double game, and are using this opportunity... in order to curry favor with leyasu, aren't you? What are you saying? Spare me your excuses! You are relieved of command of the reception committee. HoriKutaro will replace you. Nobukatsu, summon Hori. Yes, sir. Our parents, gone to heaven, cry tears of blood. Our parents, gone to heaven, cry tears of blood; they beat upon our rain-cloaks. I'm just a country bumpkin, so I'm dazzled by everything I see and hear here. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. I am humbled by such hospitality from the Minister of the Right. It's nothing. You and I, Sir leyasu, will be working together closely from now on. By the way, Sir leyasu, you should go to Kyoto, Nara and Sakaiand sightsee. I would like to go, but I have not made any preparations. Preparations aren't necessary. I'll have a guide go with you, someone familiar with the areas. I, Nobunaga, will meet you in the capital, and we'll drink together again. In that case, I shall accept your generous offer. My Lord. Those of us of Saiga know... how you must be feeling at this point, my Lord. My Lord. Patience is a virtue, but only to a point. Once Lord Nobunaga begins to hate, he will never change his mind. What have you come to tell me? You are aware that the Ikko rebels have been treated with barbaric cruelty. "Warrior Monks of Negoro-ji:" these highly-trained men were famous fortheir skills with firearms. The Saiga faction and the warrior Monks of Negoro-jiTemple will not remain silent. If an opportunity presents itself, they will leap to the attack. Nobunaga is not a human being! He's a demon! My Lord! Do not forget that Saiga and Negoro are on your side! My Lord! A courier has just arrived from Azuchibearing this letter. What is it? Hideyoshiis demanding reinforcements. He is ordering me to immediately dispatch troops to Takamatsu. My Lord, will you be placing yourself under Hideyoshi's command? Make everything ready by midnight. I am going to go pray at the Atago-Gongen Shrine. My Lord, please reconsider! My Lord! "Misfortune" "Good Luck" "Great Misfortune" You again! "Hon-no-ji:" a temple in Kyoto, the ancient capital ofJapan. Nobunaga is at Hon-no-jiTemple, guarded by Ranmaru and 25 men. They're sitting ducks. Hideyoshiis far away, engaged in battle, in need of reinforcements. Katsuie is battling Uesugi in the north. Takigawa Sakon is at Mayabashi in Joshu... and Niwa Masahide is fighting at Choshu in Shikoku. Leyasu is at Sakaiwith only 20 or 30 men. Hidden meaning of the poem: "Now the Tokifamily, will rule the Nation, this month of May." "At this time, it is raining, the month of May..." "At this time, it is raining..." "Tokifamily:" the ancestral family name of AkechiMitsuhide. "Now the Tokifamily, will rule the Nation, this month of May!" Well now, it's raining harder now. I do hope it won't hinder your departure. Note: Kyoto Settsu Kanjion Stone: "Left to Kyoto, Right to Settsu" Our enemy is at Hon-no-ji Temple, follow me! My Lord! Sign: "Hon-no-ji" Charge! Fire! My Lord! My Lord! What's going on? What's going on? Mitsuhide has revolted! What's going on? Mitsuhide has revolted! Mitsuhide has revolted! What, Mitsuhide?! Get my bow! How dare you, Mitsuhide! My Lord! Inside! Inside! Go inside! Sir Ranmaru! Tamame, watch out! It's dangerous! Tamame! Sir Ranmaru! Sir Ranmaru! You'll be okay, Sir Ranmaru! Sir Ranmaru! Sir Ranmaru! Ranmaru! Ranmaru! Who is it?! You bastard! Who are you? I'm a ghost. A ghost of the Iga Ninjas you murdered! Hurts, doesn't it? Feel the pain. Die! Die, while I watch. Victory! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Sakai Once a Ninja has been given a target, he never gives up. Especially Goemon, who is one of Iga's best. He who avenges the Minister of the Right will have the world in the palm of his hand. The most essential asset in a war... is neither strong soldiers nor superior weapons... it is possession of a just cause. The trusted subordinates of the Minister, such as Hideyoshi... are scattered around the country. It will take at least two weeks for them to assemble. If I had troops with me, I could rush them to the capital, and avenge the Minister's death. What is the fastest route from Sakaito Hamamatsu? Sir, it would be the fastest to go through Iga... then travel by sea from Shirako in Ise to the port of Mikawa. But Iga is mountainous, so the route would be difficult. Please leave that to me. When it comes to Iga, I know even the traiIs of the animals. Also, if I light a fire-signal on a certain ridge, the 300 Koga Ninjas under Taraoshi-no-bei... will swiftly arrive, as previously agreed. Prepare to cross Iga at once. Yes, sir. Well, good luck to you. Samanosuke, I understand. Please tell Lord Akechithat I will immediately gather the men and head for the capital. I am obliged to you. Please excuse me. My horse! Everyone! Nobunaga is a corpse! Lord AkechiMitsuhide kiIled him at Hon-no-jiTemple! Namu Amida-bu, namu Amida-bu, namu Amida-bu... Good riddance... Nobunaga! Dance! Maki... Darling! Hey, Goemon! How dare you go off without permission?! I'm angry at you. I'm really angry at you, you know! What's gotten into you? What's gotten into me? I'm happy! You're making me dizzy! I'm so happy, so happy I can't stand it! You're so beautiful. I've never seen you look so beautiful, Maki. I get it. What? You kiIled Nobunaga... isn't that so? Maki, I'll never leave your side again, ever. Who's that? Not to worry... he's a scout-Ninja. Good job. Go give your report. Yes, sir. The castellan of Azuchi, Gamo Kenshu, has abandoned the castle and fled. Where is Sir Hideyoshi? His whereabouts are unknown. Hurry! According to one of the men who fled the castle... According to one of the men who fled the castle... they ran out of provisions several days ago... and the morale of the soldiers is plummeting fast. We should take this opportunity to capture it... after which, we can avenge the Minister of the Right, Oda Nobunaga. Such would be the best plan. No. Their morale might be ebbing, but the enemy is unrelenting. Kikkawa and Kobayakawa's reinforcements are ready to engage in battle. They could attack us at any time. If we waste time here... and allow Niwa and Tokugawa to get ahead of us, it could mean disaster. Please leave matters here to me, your servant Kiyomasa. Lord, this will permit you to return to the capital at once. Splitting the army in two would be unwise... because it would strengthen the position of Kikkawa and Kobayakawa. My Lord, I, Masanari, oppose this plan. Is he a spy? Yes, we caught him trying to sneak into the castle. He had a secret message from Akechi to Mourion his person. What, a secret message from Mitsuhide? What, a secret message from Mitsuhide? Yes, sir. Hey! Stand up! Hey! Stand up! Move! What's going on? That bastard Mitsuhide... He has sent the same secret offer of alliance to Uesugiand Chosokabe. Moreover, he has already allied himself with the Saiga faction of Kishu. My Lord! My Lord! Has Hideyoshireturned? "Minister of the Right:" Nobunaga. As soon as he heard of the death of the Minister of the Right... he negotiated a truce with the defenders of Takamatsu Castle... and returned to Himejito raise an army with which to attack Mitsuhide. This isn't good. Everyone is thinking along the same lines. His forces in Himejican attack before our army can arrive from Hamamatsu. It is remarkable that he was able to obtain a truce and disengage... when he was clearly desperate for reinforcements. Lord Hideyoshiis a lucky man. We have no choice but to sit tight. To take arms against fortune is tantamount to blasphemy. But the day will come when even Hideyoshi's luck will desert him. We must wait for that day. I am what I am today because I am patient. My greatest enemy, Imagawa Yoshimoto, was destroyed by Nobunaga. And now Nobunaga has been struck down by Mitsuhide. Soon, either Mitsuhide will defeat Hideyoshi, or vice-versa. Only then will I, leyasu, do battle. After swiftly repositioning his army, Hideyoshiengaged Mitsuhide at Yamazakiin Settsu. At the same time, he dispatched Ishida Mitsunarito Kishu with orders to obliterate the Saiga faction. After swiftly repositioning his army, Hideyoshiengaged Mitsuhide at Yamazakiin Settsu. At the same time, he dispatched Ishida Mitsunarito Kishu with orders to obliterate the Saiga faction. Pursue them! Pursue them! Pursue them! Pursue them! We are now going to come to the aid of Lord Akechi. Your leader will be Matsuda Gensandayu. It goes without saying that Hideyoshiis just as much the enemy of the Saiga faction... as Nobunaga was! Fight well, and bring honor to the name of the Saiga faction. I will be awaiting good news. Depart! Hurrah! Hurrah! Enemy attack! What?! We're being attacked! It's Ishida Mitsunari's army! They've surrounded the fort! Bastard! Lord! Lord! Lord! Damn it. This is hard work. It's nothing. What bothers me is that I can't fill everyone's stomachs. We must cut the rations by half, starting tomorrow. Again? They've got us surrounded, but are not attacking. They're waiting for our food to run out, and minimizing their casualties. It's Ishida Mitsunari's usual strategy. Why don't we attack them, then? Then we would fall into their trap. But what we must consider... is if Hideyoshi, who sent Ishida Mitsunari here, managed to seize Takamatsu Castle. We haven't heard from Lord Akechiin some time. Maybe Hideyoshigot him! What could Tokugawa be doing? Uesugiand Chosokabe... we have no news of them at all. Lord, I will go and investigate. Not yet. I am a Ninja! I can't just sit here and do nothing! Lord, 15 of our men sallied to assault the enemy, we couldn't stop them. Namu Amida-bu... Namu Amida-bu... Namu Amida-bu... Namu Amida-bu... Charge! The wisdom of Amida is like a light that illuminates everything. The power of this light is infinite, beyond the comprehension of ordinary humans. The light of wisdom shines everywhere, a beacon for all who have lost their way. Is there no way to save them? They are completely surrounded and heavily out- numbered. It was impossible to get through. I tried to contact Goemon, but was unable to do so. As things stand now, the fort will fall in no more than a few days. Hey! Riders approaching! Riders approaching! It's an arrow-message from Hideyoshi. "The days of your fort are numbered." "Give up this futile resistance, and surrender with honor." Listen to the end. "If you surrender, none of you will be punished." "To your leader, SuzukiMagoichi, a stipend of 20,000-koku will be granted." "Land will also be granted to others, as appropriate." "However, the Saiga faction must be dissolved." "All of your firearms will be confiscated." We'd be as vulnerable as babies without our firearms! That's right! Don't let them fool you, they won't grant us any land! And they'll impose high taxes that will ensure we starve to death! That's right. Send that thing back to them. Did you not understand me when I said listen to the end?! "The rebel AkechiMitsuhide... "... was easily defeated in battle at Yamazaki... "...and was finally kiIled by a peasant." "His head is now on display... "... on a hill in Yamashina." "If you reject these terms... "...and continue to resist... "... we shall attack using Portuguese cannons." Let them shoot at us then! When Honga-jiTemple in Ishiyama fell... we here in Saiga became the last of the Ikko sect. Hideyoshiopposes the teachings of our precious Amitabha, and thus we hold him in contempt. However, if we cannot prevaiI in this world, then we must seek to do so in the next. Reverence Donjyo, please listen. I must disagree. We have all devoted ourselves to the Saiga faction of the Ikko sect. We mustn't give up, no matter what. Everyone! We mustn't retreat! Let us forge ahead, as we have been taught! That's right! That's right! Quiet! Calm down... This is a very important decision, not just for the Saiga faction, but for each of you individually. Let's decide the matter as we always do, by putting it to a vote. Don't be overcome by the passions of the moment, think deeply about it. Have they replied to the letter? Not a word. All we hear from the fort is a lot of chanting. They're insane. Impossible to deal with... why don't we simply launch an assault and crush them? Calm yourself. We will compel the enemy to surrender while minimizing our own losses. Such is the true meaning of victory. Always remember that. Cutting rations in half again? Starting today, it's just rice-water. Be strong. Here... Here... Oh... thanks... If Goheiwere alive today, he'd be walking by now. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop that! I'm hungry! Gimme more! Mom, gimme more! More! Coward! Behave like a man! Listen. Your dad died bravely, in front of everyone! His son shouldn't be crying just because he's hungry. You naughty boy! Namu Amida-bu, namu Amida-bu... Here, he can have this. Nonsense, that is your ration. It's all right. Come on, take it. Take it. Have another one. The way things are going, everyone will starve to death. We'll lose the battle without even fighting. I can't accept that. I've got to do something. I'll bring the warrior Monks of Negoro here! Please, let me do this. Agreed. Go. Commander. Those who go boldly go to paradise. Those who retreat fall into hell. Get in position! Get in position! Guard the gates! Go! Darling. Be careful! Don't worry. I shall return to you, with the Negoro monks. I promise. And if I should die, don't be sad. Because I'm going to die happy. Then I'll watch over you from the lap of Amitabha. Yes. Don't cry, Maki. We shall meet again in paradise. We will be together with Gohei, for all eternity. Yes... Time to go. Fire! Enemy attack! Enemy attack! Charge! Charge! Lord! Lord! Fire! Fire! Assassin! Hurry! Don't let the assassin get away! Commander! Commander! "Live to kill Hideyoshi" Maki! Maki! Maki! Maki! Maki! Maki! Maki. I will avenge you. I will avenge Gohei. I will avenge the Ikko sect. I will never give up. Namu Marishi-ten, I would gladly burn in hell, if it meant the death of Hideyoshi. I ask for your protection. Hold it. Hanzo. What are you doing here? I came to give you a gift from leyasu. Here. Farewell. It's the Juraku. Having defeated the lkko sect, who had so long plagued Nobunaga, Hideyoshilaunched his own effort to unite and rule the nation. He built an enormous mansion, the Juraku-dai, in the capital of Kyoto, to serve as his new headquarters. A monster! Emergency! Emergency! Intruder! Intruder! Get him! Over there! Catch him! Over here! Over here! Over here! Insolence! Get out! Get out! Take this! Damn! What a persistent rascal. What's your name? I am Ishikawa Goemon! Don't kill him. Confine him. Damn you, Hideyoshi! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull! Tie him up! Tie him up! Tie his hands! Tie him up! Tie his hands! Tie his hands! Hurry! Didn't Hanzo know about the "nightingale floor" alarm? He got as far as any Ninja could. He failed, but I'm not surprised. I had no expectations. He will be executed by being publicly boiled alive, rather severe, is it not? The days when a few Ninjas could control the fate of the world are now over. And what will the future bring? Don't you know, Tadakatsu? Nobunaga boiled the rice for the rice-cakes. Hideyoshimade the rice-cakes. Now I simply wait for the day when those rice-cakes will be placed before me. The End
