Baghdad, the fabulous city of the Scheherazade of "The Thousand and One Nights". Fortress in the desert for five thousand years, crossroads between the civilized world and the wild East. Legend has it that Adam and Eve founded Baghdad when they were expelled from the Garden of Eden. Perhaps it is true, because in Baghdad, the incredible is possible. Baghdad, the bastion of peace for the Arabs where for seven centuries there has been no peace. Although the faithful pray on their knees five times a day, unfortunately, Allah does not answer his prayers. The Turkish military authorities do not pray, of course. Prayers are useless before the rapacious tribes of the desert. You forget, Pasha Ali Nadim, that my people come from the desert. I was not referring to the Bedouin tribes, but to the Black Chilabas, but growing up in England it is logical that you do not know them. - Black Djellabas! Q - Less than an hour from Baghdad! Q Do you realize you weren't exaggerating, ma'am? Curious Bedouin custom! Q They know they are more and we cannot fight them. They stop to negotiate before beginning the massacre. I'll go see what I can do. I wouldn't worry about Pasha. He is not in danger. Neither do you. The black Djellabas only want weapons and ammunition. How do you know? We camel drivers, sooner or later, find out everything. Do you learn to speak English with a French accent? - Who are you? - They call me Hassan, and the accent is Viennese, not French. Our military governor diligently fulfills his duty but the Black Djellabas will take what they want, as always. In Constantinople this is not going to like anything, nor will I deal with thieves and murderers. - It's very dangerous? - Do you think we're in England? Those savages will stop at nothing! Q Except when they get what they want! Q Apparently he considers me a coward! Q No, the military governor is a very sensible diplomat. You would prefer him to be a dead foolish hero. - A very Bedouin look! Q - That's what I am! Q The soldiers will escort you the rest of the way. I must reach the citadel before the mail leaves Constantinople. I have to report the latest outrage by the Djelabas Negras. I will visit you later. I'll be here for a short time, if my father waits for me we'll leave tomorrow. I will not lose hope. It is written in the Qur'an: "What will be, will be." We weren't expecting you, ma'am. We are full, but I will arrange for you a satisfactory accommodation. I'm sure they're waiting for me. My father stays here. There is no English gentleman in the hotel. My father is Sheikh Khasim Ibn Barak of the Aremlak tribe of Bi-en-Naga. - Are you Princess Marjan? - Indeed. A thousand pardons, princess, I did not imagine that he was an Arab. Well, she already knows. Some of your subjects have come. They said they would camp outside. - Go find them immediately. - Yes, princess. Immediately. You camel driver! Q Bedouin beggars and thieves! Q Sir, these gentlemen are looking for you. They say your cousin is in Baghdad and wishes to see you immediately. He waits in the citadel of the Turkish governor. -Since when is he in Baghdad? - I don't know, sir. - Since when? - Mr. Raizul will inform you. He must come right away. Go back to your master and tell him I'll come when I please. It's not pretty but it's not bad, I'll keep it. Let's see this. Princess, I beg you, I am poor and my children are hungry. -I want to know if his father will pay me. - It will. - But it is that... - Silence, paunchy. Yes, princess. Muhammad Jad! Q The veil! Q Since you were a child I have not seen his uncovered face. Many people have seen it. Your father would sink his august beard into the earth. I'll have to talk to him, that's very unhygienic. Where is he, why hasn't he come? Allah forgive me, I spoke without thinking. My father said that it was one of his weaknesses. -Where is the? -His father... I can't speak in front of these people. - Get your things and go right away. - Waiting! Q Now a servant of my father gives orders for me? Who will pay for all this? They told me that the great sheikh of the Aremlak. -And he will. - There is no money to pay anything. The Aremlak is uninhabited, jackals roam the ruins of our oasis and your father is dead! Q - I don't believe you. - Your father is dead. They treacherously killed him and his tribe was liquidated. Quick, go away! Q That dress is mine, I will not allow it to be stolen. I am a poor man with many hungry children. This is £200 in London, no one is out to rip you off. - Gather your things and go! Q - Yes, princess. Come on, come on, hurry up! Q Run! Q Muhammad Jad! Q Tell me everything. Prince Ahmed Khabar of El Jhazir, mortal enemy of the Aromlak, summoned your father to a meeting to end the bloody fights. Ahmed Khabar offered his life to ensure his safety. Your father, having no son, wished to make peace. Disregarding my advice, he went to the indicated place, an ambush by the Black Djellabas. That night they entered Bir-en-Naga and threw your father's head at us, mocking everything as they burned and killed. Allah took mercy on me and I survived the slaughter, I saw his boss leave on your father's white horse. Was their leader Prince Ahmed Khabar? Only he knew about the meeting, and only a prince would ride a horse of the Burnaya breed. So life for life, Ahmed Khabar's for my father's. You. He will avenge you? A spoiled woman in England? If you have friends there she comes back with them, if not, maybe a rich man from Baghdad will buy you for his harem. You can't do anything for the Aremlak! Q - We can't help you. - We will appeal to the military governor. How naive! Q They informed the Pasha before leaving for Damascus. So, did you know that my father had been murdered? Yes, and he will do nothing. He called me crazy for accusing Khabar of being with the Black Djellabas. Even a cousin of Ahmed Khabar is a guest of the Pasha in the citadel. And do you suggest that we go to the Pasha to demand justice? We would be expelled from the city! Q Remember that I am your princess. You will follow me wherever I go. The Pachá will attend to us, I promise. - Where are these people going? - We want to see Pasha Ali Nadim. Like all of Baghdad, but rests and must not be disturbed. He is already awake, so we will not interrupt his sleep. What happen? Who has sounded the alarm? I want to see the Pasha. It is impossible! Q Tell him that Princess Marjan of Aremlak requests an immediate audience. Her highness awaits you. So Hassan the camel driver! Q Your father the emir would be proud if he could see you. I doubt it, cousin, although you seem to like it. I've come to take you home. Your relationship with the Djellabas Negras is a disgrace to our people, but your father offers you to be judged by the elders of the tribe, to which you are entitled as the crown prince of El Jhazir. This is what your father has ordered me to tell you. You have fulfilled it very well and before witnesses. But, between cousins, tell me Raizul, Do you think I'm the leader of the Black Djellabas? What does it matter what I believe? Can you come with us? I cannot, to defend myself against that accusation, I need to know many things about the Black Djellabas. - Do you defy the emir? - It's one way of interpreting it. Then I'll give you some personal advice, For your own safety and the honor of our people, go back to Europe where you learned and forgot so much. Stay there and let your father think you're dead. Cousin, your concern touches me deeply. You are very generous. I thank you for making me the richest camel driver in Baghdad, which is what I intend to be for a while. Good to maintain the figure and calm the nerves. I just spoke with Prince Ahmed Khabar. Yes, I knew that already. Did you also know that he has come from Damascus in your caravan, disguised as Hassan, the camel driver? So your cousin was present at the Djelabas Negras attack. Very interesting. He refuses to leave Baghdad. It is stupid on his part, in Baghdad he is in great danger. - And what do you plan to do? - Whatever is needed. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a lady waiting for me, she very beautiful and very impatient. - Find Hassan, the camel driver. - Yes, Excellency. - When you do, kill him. - Yes, Excellency. Sorry to keep you waiting, she had urgent business. - Are you angry, madam? -Why didn't she tell me? - The fact that? Oh, about her father. - Yes, exactly. Would he have given her life back? I didn't want to tell you such dire news, she would have made me very sad. You knew that my father was murdered, and also who killed him. That is not quite correct. An accusation is not proof. The government cannot avenge bloody tribal disputes. Prince Ahmed Khabar swore to ensure my father's safety. We have a right to claim that life! Q Unfortunately, you have to claim it from the Emir of El Jhazir, Constantinople orders me not to intervene in anything that compels the emir to denounce our treaty of alliance. I already said that justice would not be done to us here! Q You seek revenge and not justice! Q It's a Bedouin matter, I can't do anything. But sit down, let us consider the matter sensibly. Your people could work in the citadel as servants or even as soldiers, if they swear allegiance to the government and cease their bloody fights. What do you think, respectable old man? The Aremlak do not accept charity from men. Do you expect the lady to wander with you in the desert? I do not ask for anything, that she follow her path and we follow ours. The Aremlaks will go on their way and the lady will stay, as it should be. She will not regret her decision to stay in Baghdad. With the Pasha's personal protection, surely not. There is an almost European café, with excellent food and French champagne, the Café Ifrangi. We will have dinner there tonight to celebrate our agreement. And to let all of Baghdad know that I am under her protection. You are not only charming, but also intelligent. The camel driver will own numerous caravans. He will go to Mecca three times and wear a pilgrim's turban. She will have many sons and no daughters. Tonight, sir, at Cafe Ifrangi. Sir, we're being watched. Keep going, when I stray, follow me. Excellency, he has escaped! Q - The outside. Out of! Q Go away, I'm busy! Q Yes, Excellency! Q Your Highness, I tell you quite frankly that you are taking a great risk in Baghdad disguised as a camel driver. Totally agree with your Excellency. It's too dangerous, I'll stop doing it. Will he return with Prince Raizul to El Jhazir? No, I like living in Baghdad. Your Highness, you make it very difficult for me, I must insist... I'm sure he won't deny me hospitality from him. I try to protect him, many want to kill him. I have already met some. Others seek revenge and they will find it, They have sworn to take your life. - The Aremlaks? - Yes. If they kill you in Baghdad, I would be held accountable. I have no intention of letting myself be killed in Baghdad or anywhere. Hassan the camel driver is not safe, I admit, but I don't think anything unpleasant will happen to say, Hassan, the rich merchant from Cairo, guest of the military governor in the citadel. He will not hint to continue this childish game of dress-up! Q It would be undignified, stop fantasizing. His father would hold me responsible. Not if I am under the protection of the Pasha which I do not think you will refuse to grant me. Naturally. So I accept his hospitable invitation. We can have dinner together, Café Ifrangi has been recommended to me. I already had a commitment to which I am late, with a lady, you'll excuse me. If I have to excuse you, I will. - Excellency, me! Q - You idiot, shut up! Q Excellency, we are honored by her presence! Q Ms! Q When you dine with Pasha Ali Nadim, you should look at Pasha Ali Nadim. Sorry, I wasn't looking at anyone in particular. An excellent idea. Sir, the Arabs at that table have covered their faces but they were with Raizul. I'm more interested in the man they're with. Please, efendi, follow me. Over here please. - The Pachá wants me to accompany him. -But, he is having dinner with a lady. I can see that. Good evening, Excellency, I hope I haven't kept you waiting. Goodnight. Since his excellence has fallen silent before so much beauty, let me. I'm Hassan, a jewelry dealer from Cairo. Before Hassan, camel driver from Damascus, if I'm not mistaken. Princess Marjan is not wrong, but there is a simple explanation. With this, it was smarter to take a camel, especially with the Djellabas Negras so active, but being the Pasha's guest and counting on his protection, I can display my treasures without fear. The Pasha is very generous in protecting him. Thank you, both of you are more so with your compliments, but my duty is to provide protection to whoever arrives in Baghdad. Does that include the gentleman sitting at that table? To him in particular, it is Lavellar. He represents the company that sells ammunition to my government. Does he also trade with the desert tribes? It is forbidden, they are probably friends, Café Ifrangi is very cosmopolitan, it brings together very diverse people. Which is very convenient, isn't it? If I were governor, I would be interested in Lavellar's friends. It is surprising that the Black Djellabas know which caravans carry weapons. You prefer rubies, me too. It is a perfect jewel... for you. In that case, I'll buy it for her. Put a price on it. An impeccable beauty is not bought, Excellency, not even a Pasha. What do you suggest for dinner? His Excellency has already ordered. - For two. - Well, let it be for three. - I've heard the food is excellent. - Thank the Pasha, it was he who wanted Baghdad to have a Continental Café. I'm surprised you didn't want European entertainment too. Unfortunately, European artists don't come that far. - I can offer my services. - What do you say, Princess! Q You will not pretend to sing in a public cafe. - Why not? I must earn my living. - No way. I think this is a good idea. Since this place is surely protected by the Pasha, he will surely fix it immediately. I don't know, it's very irregular. Excellency, give your consent. It would be a great honor if the lady sang. Thank you. For her to bring him luck, and because she should only be worn by a princess. Thank you, I accept the compliment but not the jewel. He came to me easily and he must easily go. Come. His Excellency will excuse us. Excellency, I didn't know what to do. - Beautiful and talented! Q - You have been magnificent! Q You haven't sang since we left Damascus. You deprived me of that great pleasure. With His Excellency's permission, If Princess Marjan would agree to sing a little bit every night, I'll pay you whatever you ask, that is, if it's not too much. Since she will sing for me, I will allow it, but you will have to pay her very well. You have pleased me tonight. Excellence! Q You cannot refuse a gift from Pasha Ali Nadim. -I hope that his Excellency sleeps well. - I don't suffer from insomnia. He will have a clear conscience. By the way, she forgot to fire the car. He may have to go out again to examine the city's defenses. The work of a military governor has no end. It's such a beautiful night that I might join you if it's finally necessary to examine the city's defences. Don't you think we've spent enough time together already? No, I enjoy every minute. Fire the car. - But... - Go. - Good evening, Highness. - Good evening, Excellency. Sir, I don't understand why he plays cluelessness with the pasha. It shouldn't be surprising, Saleel, being a man of many wives. I would like to be at home with one of them. Wait, my lord. Doubts about the Pasha? - And you, sir? - As much as a sparrow from a leopard. - I'll sleep at your door, sir. - You'll be up for a while. If you see that the Pachá tries to leave, call me. We don't want you to wake up Princess Marjan. Sir, that woman is Aremlak, he will not weigh on her like... She just like a smart woman, and for that she should be watched. We simply carry out your father's orders. Since you refuse to obey him, I will take you by force. No! Q - Don't shoot! H-He runs away again. Go outside! Q Fool, savage, I told you to leave it to me! Q You were with him and the lady at Cafe Ifrangi. He has returned as your guest of honor. It's weird, suddenly you're really good friends. He is still the prince of El Jhazir. - If I had killed him in the citadel... - I wasn't going to kill him here. They would have found him in the street, a victim of thieves, who would suspect that it really was Prince Ahmed Khabar? - Now we've lost him. - Let them search and find him. In Baghdad, I am the boss. If you forget, I'll have to stop intervening in this matter. Do not even dream about it. You broke your oath for gold, so you're out of position. Capture him while he's still Hassan, the rich merchant. Your Excellency, is Princess Marjan not with you? Do you see her? Where is she? She left the dressing room an hour ago. You're late for the performance! Q I warned you not to let her go anywhere alone. I swear I couldn't do anything. The woman! Q Excuse me. The Princess said that I would be punished if she followed her. In the week you've been here I've aged a year. She doesn't know how much I fear her. - You should be afraid of me. - It's a regrettable mistake. -I told her, but she replied... Her Excellency will not want to hear what she said. You will be punished at dawn, 60 lashes on her feet, if you don't find her in less than an hour. Yes, Excellency. I have brought this. With this you can buy food, horses, weapons, whatever you need. Devil's money, thrown at your feet by morons, in exchange for a song or a smile. Go back to the city where they proclaim her name in the market and take the damned treasures from her. The old man talking like a child. Everything that the Black Djellabas do is known at Café Ifrangi. I'll be there until I find out who their leader is. When the time comes, I will need your help. You will obey me as my father. Quick, the city closes the gates. Charity, for Allah's sake! Q Charity, for Allah's sake! Q Mister! Q Charity for the holy wanderer of Marrakech! Q Don't go back to Cafe Ifrangi. Stay at the consulate until you can return to England! Q Now you're a bum, who are you, what do you want? That doesn't matter, but it does matter that you leave Baghdad. The women who make fun of Pachá appear floating in the Tigris. I'm not going to leave Baghdad and I'm not afraid of the Pasha. So he feared the Black Djellabas. They know you checked out Cafe Ifrangi. Why do you know so much about the Black Djellabas? Soldiers! Q Hasan, wait! Q Are you sure he doesn't have any more jewelry in the hotel? Yes, Excellency, he took them all. You have been away for a long time. Did it seem so much to you? Prepare my dress, the blue and silver one. Excellent, it will match your jewelry. I handed over my jewelry to my men. I will be able to dispose of what is given to me! Q And is this so precious that you do not part with it? I have never considered it mine. I want to return it. I understand that tonight you could have done it. I didn't think she would see him. Have you made an appointment with him to return the ruby? I couldn't, your soldiers prevented it. And you are only interested in the handsome Arab returning the jewel? Well no. I am interested to know why you come one day as a guest, then he disappears and your soldiers try to kill him. Against my wish, since I gave him protection, and just because I deeply appreciate it, I will break the trust of my office. Your friend Hassan, the one in the costumes, He is Prince Ahmed Khabar, according to your people, the chief of the Black Djelabas. And why was he your guest in the citadel? Women do not understand the delicate affairs of state. Arrest the crown prince of El Jhazir he would bring many problems to my government. Tonight I tried to prevent it by eliminating a simple bum, a beggar. Unfortunately, I failed. - Are your men still after him? - Naturally. But there's a problem, if he decided to return to the citadel as Prince Ahmed Khabar, I should offer you my hospitality. What if the Aremlaks found him first? Interesting possibility. Will you allow us to take him to the desert? To, according to your tradition, do what the government does not dare? Yes, his life for my father's. After, of course, a slow torture. You Bedouin are truly a wild people. We also know how to be grateful. If I made such a concession to you, would I deserve your gratitude? We Aremlak have a saying: "Promise for promise". It is, promise for promise. Charity, for Allah's sake! Q Allah rewards the charitable! Q - Charity for Allah's sake! Q - They want to see you, beggar. I have done nothing, I know nothing! Q Shut up and follow me! Q Don't let them kill me, have mercy. Your miserable life is not in danger if you obey. I must speak to the tramp who was with you at the gates. - The one who calls himself Hassan. - I don't know him. - You lie! Q - You will die for it! Q Kill me, I will not betray him. Who speaks of treason? Find Hassan, tell him I must see him at my hotel when I get back from Cafe Ifrangi. He won't come, he doesn't trust anyone. Give him this, he won't distrust me. If you don't give it to him, we'll look for you all over the streets. and we will bury you in an anthill with your head smeared with honey. Let's go! Q That woman is indefatigable! Q He has been walking for an hour, and faster and faster. Not even my wives, who adore me, would be so impatient. My lord was wise to suspect treachery. But I'll be a big jerk if I find out too late that he was wrong, and that his heart aches to see me. Mister! Q The princess will have to rest after such a hectic night. You'll return this tomorrow with my respects. Tell her that she couldn't come to her, but that I won't be long in seeing her. The English say that a false penny always comes back. Today I found out that it also applies to rubies. Especially this ruby. The Pachá seems to enjoy it, but it's not funny. You guys are angry and nervous, and that brings me to this question, Is it due to the frustrated desire to take revenge on an enemy or wounded vanity because instinct in the face of danger made him forget your undeniable charms? Your song can wait. Prince Ahmed Khabar has informed his father, the emir, that he will defend himself before a council of tribal representatives. The emir has assembled the council at the Rock Oasis Khorasan, where all men are bound by an ancient oath of peace. The emir asks us to ask Pasha Ali Nadim to attend so that everyone knows that his government will support the ruling of the sheikhs. We await your decision, Excellency. As everyone knows, Baghdad is the seat of justice. It pains me that the Grand Emir of El Jhazir is suspicious of her. Excellence. Prince Ahmed Khabar can only be judged by supreme sheikhs, not by the Baghdad government. But if he were forced to hand him over to the desert tribes, It would be like confessing that I have failed as a military governor. How would it be a confession or a failure, if with his help we discovered the truth of the Black Djellabas? In fact, Excellency, if you refuse to support the council, there will be those who interpret it as a different kind of confession. Is his Highness insinuating that he protected the Black Djellabas? I'm not implying anything. Like these sages of El Jhazir, I await your decision. I will try to communicate with Constantinople. It is a very special case and I do not know if I have the authority to decide without the approval of my superiors. Your Excellency, we cannot wait for instructions from Constantinople. The council has already been convened and the emir expects you to attend. You have no alternative. - Very well. - Tomorrow we leave together. Until then we will accept your hospitality at the citadel. Yes, of course, it is an honour. Have rooms prepared immediately for their excellencies. I hope you rest, Excellency. Princess Marjan, why didn't they tell me you were waiting? He was busy with more important guests. You can't imagine the gravity of the moment. I only know that the murderer you promised to deliver to the Aremlak he is in the citadel and he is your honored guest. He will leave tomorrow. The emir has called a council to judge him. Look how good, he will be judged by his own father and of course declared innocent! Q It's possible, but I can't do anything at all. You just have to keep your promise. Let my people enter the citadel and stop him. The compound is infested with Bedouins and I've had enough! Q It's our business, the prince belongs to us. I'm sick of this Bedouin plague. Let them eat hot sand and die in their dirty desert. I'll go back to Constantinople where people live civilly, and you'll come with me, we're going out tonight. Old man, go to the lady's hotel and pack her luggage, be ready when we arrive. Didn't you hear me? - I am not going anywhere. - Me neither! Q I'm sorry to inform you that you shouldn't make me angry. I no longer beg, I command. You are not in a position to order. The great Pasha Ali Nadim fleeing Baghdad for fear of an assassin. You're not just pathetic, you're ridiculous. Wild Bedouin! Q Excellency, Excellency! Q How dare you bother the Pasha right now? I have heard noises. And more you'll hear if you bother him again. Where is Ahmed Khabar? Join us. Do as the princess commands. walking. Black djellabas in the citadel! Q And in it is Ahmed Khabar! Q Lead us to him, quickly! Q Lord, Lord! Q -She finds her Excellency. - Yes, Highness. Here. That all the Black Djellabas leave the citadel immediately. Lord, we have found the Pasha! Q Muhammad Jad, look! Q Do you dare to look me in the face? Why not? I'm going to make you a great man. Following the Black Djelabas to Baghdad, to the citadel, charging myself with the responsibility, how am I going to explain it? You will be able to testify before the council that they entered Baghdad to rescue their boss who was your prisoner but you did not allow him to escape. You killed the chief of the Black Djelabas with your own hands. He lies unconscious in your reception room. Come on, Pasha Ali Nadim, become a hero. Come on, he shoots. So you were going to make me a great man! Q Stupid, wild! Q Ahmed Khabar lives and will tell all this in the council. We will arrive before him. You will tell the emir that his son escaped with the Black Chilabas. - No, I'm going to Constantinople. - You come with me. Ahmed Khabar will die before being tried. You and I will make it so. Why do you take so much trouble? Leave me here a few more hours and between the sun and the vultures - You won't have to kill me. - We don't want you to die yet. We take you to Bir-en-Naga for the Aremlak to see the punishment of my father's murderer. One noise and I will kill you! Q The soldiers and the Pasha! Q They go to council anyway, of course. They'll testify that the assault justifies my guilt, and thanks to you, they'll get away with it. My father's white colt! Q - Who rides it? - My cousin Raizul. My father was on that horse when the Djelabas killed him. For the thousandth time, my cousin is the chief of the Black Djellabas, he always has been, and your friend the Pachá is up to his neck in this. - You lie! Q - No, it's the honest truth. I'll say it another way. I speak as Prince Ahmed Khabar of El Jhazir to Princess Marjan of the Aremlak. In the name of Allah, I only ask for time to prove the truth. Let me attend the council. If my enemies win, who are also yours, I swear by Allah that only your dagger will pierce my heart. Princess, he betrayed your father, he will also betray you. I swear it with my blood. If you lie, you will suffer even more for having done so. But if he's telling the truth, he'll need our help. We'll go to council together. Mercy great lords of the desert, do not kill us! Q We are poor and harmless gypsies! Q We go to the meeting of the sheikhs to tell the fortune, shoe horses and ask for alms. We have nothing worthwhile and women are useless and old, and as you can see very ugly. Silence, women are worth more than the men around them. We'll trade our horses for your mules, our clothes for yours, and this to close the deal. Ruby is for women as compensation for the misfortune of being your wives and daughters. One thing! Q Haven't you got a dress to lend me that makes old men stroke their beards? Yes, I will show it to you. We will become gypsies and you will become Bedouins. May Allah witness this great miracle! Q The oasis is neutral ground. Only sheikhs and their entourage can enter. And the Pasha's soldiers are camped here. Stop, if you take one more step I'll open fire! Q Who are you, where do you come from? We neither come nor go anywhere, we are gypsies. Gypsies! Q Men thieves and liars and women... The question is how do I get to my father. Be careful, I know the Pasha and the sentinels will be looking for you. Entertainment and a banquet have been provided, as you ordered. Now that you've arrived I'll fire the dancers. I don't want my guests to share my sorrows, - keep the fun going. - As ordered by the Emir. Gypsies? What are you doing here? We come in peace, great commander of heroes. We only ask for food and water, in return we will shoe the horses, fix the pots and we will read you fortune. Take them to the soldiers' camp! Q But the soldiers have no money, they won't pay us! Q They'll feed you if you earn it! Q Do not leave the camp, watch them at all times! Q Yes captain. walking! Q Hurry, let's go! Q I see you have ridden many terrible horses, Your hand is hard and callused, you did hard labor. That's the past, tell me the future! Q Your wishes will be fulfilled. Soon you will be captain, rich, and you will have many women. Tomorrow I will buy you, gypsy, as my first wife. But tomorrow you won't be rich yet, soldier, you still have a lot left. You can't read the future! Q Before the night is over, I'll be able to buy many like you! Q This is ugly, not me. And since I'll be rich too, why don't you choose me, gypsy? Neither you, nor him, nor Pasha himself. I'm tired of reading the fortune. And the song you promised, gypsy? I'm going to look for the musicians. Come back quickly or I'll come looking for you. The song for him, gypsy, me! Q - They are not the soldiers of the city! Q - They're not even soldiers. Look. There's one of these under every chair. Black Djellabas! Q That's why the Pasha left Baghdad with 30 men and now he has five times as many! Q - But why? - They are Raizú's men. It's obvious they want to assassinate the entire council. And they will blame you, believing you to be the chief of the Black Djellabas! Q Forcing him to disappear leaving Raizul owner of the desert. There is an oasis of El Jhazir six hours away. May Allah we can ask for help in time! Q But there is no time left, they talk about being rich in the morning. Whatever the plan is for tonight. We will buy time. Coloquinty pumpkins! Q Horses eat them but if a man does it he feels like dying, and for hours he suffers so much that he implores himself to death. Collect all the pumpkins you find. I'll hold off the soldiers while Prince Ahmed escapes. I must not go, you. He will warn my people. Here you are in danger. And how will you entertain them? Dancing and singing for them? Don't worry about the princess. When they've eaten, we can escape. You gypsy! Q To work, gypsy dogs! Q You promised a song, we are waiting! Q I won't keep you waiting any longer! Q But my people starve. They will eat the leftovers when their masters eat. Show that you are grateful! Q Take the food pans to the soldiers! Q - Do it carefully! Q - With great care, noble soldier. Go away, Prince Ahmed Khabar, and may Allah be with you. Also to you Mohamed Jad. Hey gypsies, get back to work until we're done! You stay to keep me company! The soldiers have finished eating. We can only wait a few minutes. If the princess cannot escape we will have to go looking for her. My people are hungry, I'll take this and I'll be right back. I'll go with you, so you won't be in a hurry. Gourd gourds, an old Bedouin trick! My men are useless, useless. It could have been worse, they will recover soon. Yes, but not tonight! Lady Marjan of the Aremlak and the warriors of her dirty tribe! No, friend, they are gypsies, nothing more. It is important that you remember it. - Where is Ahmed Khabar? - I do not know. Of course you know. Witnesses describe a tall, young Arab, very handsome for a gypsy. He went and killed a sentinel, where is he? - I told you I don't know. - What are you doing there? Discover the chief of the Black Djellabas. - Well, it's a disgrace! - No friend. If I am not mistaken, there is a method prescribed by the law of the desert to punish poisoners. It consists of burying them up to the neck, then the spearmen inflict a slow death on them. One spear for each eye. One for each ear. It will be fun. You don't want to see it. Did England lose its taste for desert sports? I demand that I be brought before the Emir. That is impossible, the emir does not speak with gypsies. He will talk to Princess Marjan of the Aremlak. You're just a gypsy who tried to kill my men. For that you will be punished. Now it's the old man's turn, unless you tell me if Ahmed Khabar is still alive. Maybe you tell me, old man. Bad manners even for a Bedouin. Bring these two. Wait, Your Highness. I suggest you take the woman first, -May the old man enjoy her death. - As you like. They told me you were dead, would Allah have it so. This is my son, turn him on. Sir, I'm here to be judged by the council. I demand my rights as prince of El Jhazir. This is my witness, Princess Marjan of the Aremlak. They accuse me of murdering her father. I have sworn in blood, that if I am found guilty, my punishment will rest in her hands. There will be no punishment. Great Emir, by Bedouin law I must be heard. Princess Marjan is present. Ahead. Yes sir. The absence of my cousin, Prince Raizul, speaks for itself. I declare you guilty of the crimes that were imputed to me and accused Pasha Ali Nadim of being his accomplice. Where is Raizul, Excellency? Has he abandoned You? Has he left you alone before the punishment of the spears? Or has he gone to see if his Black Djellabas have recovered? to assassinate his father's brother and the rest of the desert jeues? Answer, Pasha Ali Nadim. I think Raizul has answered for you. This is my defense, Raizul at the head of the Djelabas. The El Jhazir await my signal in the hills. Ahmed! The veil! I don't think he misses it. Your father! Pretend you don't see it.
