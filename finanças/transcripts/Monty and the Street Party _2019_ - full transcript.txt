Down. Down! Cut it out! Stop! Cut it...! Geez! I'm so sorry. We weren't supposed to start like that. I popped off a second and he just went crazy. Let's introduce ourselves. This is Helmuth, part bulldog, part wannabe X Factor participant. Check him out. Isn't he hilarious? Look. You're wondering who I am. Well, I'm like a supervisor. My name is Pelle Asbjørn Eriksen. I work here at SSD, which stands for Secret Surveillance of Denmark. Just check out all these monitors. This is the ultimate surveillance center. I can see everything in all of Denmark. I see people falling in love, then they become really fond of each other, and then they get married. But it's tougher than you think. Love becomes a grind. It often turns sour. I see it all the time. The great love-bubble bursts. Everyone gets divorced, and it makes me so sad. And it can go wrong even in the most perfect places. Denmark is officially the happiest country in the world. In other words, all Danes should be happy and content. Take him for example. His name is Monty. He's ten years old and lives on Düsseldorf Avenue, and right now Monty thinks life is all fun and games, but let's take a closer look. Good morning, Mom and Dad! I'm just so happy! It's crazy how every day is better than the day before! Pancakes for breakfast! Exactly. Dad just whipped them up for you, my son. You need to remember to eat your grains, too. Yuck! Kirsten, they look a bit coarse. Dad, we have to begin planning the annual street party! You got it, Monty. Street parties are just the best thing I know! I'm full now. Can I go now, mom? No, you need to remember to eat some grains. Right, see you later, grown-up people! Wow! My parents are really cool. Thanks. I'd like a scooter too, Kirsten. Just like a little kid, Thorbjørn? No. I'd never go that fast, or if I did, I would need a helmet on. -You're shedding. -It's dandruff, it's natural, Kirsten. Would you like some on your yoghurt? Some dandruff topping on your yoghurt is like a vitamin supplement. FOR SALE What's going on here? This is the kind of house we're looking for. Fabulous. I'll send you the papers to you over an email before 5 p.m., okay? We'll stay a while and enjoy the garden. That sounds excellent. Take care! Bye! Hi, you guys. Are you buying that house or something? Ha-ha, well hello, little one. Yes, maybe. It's always so nice when amazing and happy people move to the neighbourhood. Thank you. It's wonderful with that kind of positive attitude. I'm gonna tell the news to the whole neighborhood. See you! Hey, kid? Would you like to show us around, so we can get an impression? I'd love to. I live right over there, and our neighbors are the Skovlykke family. They're on vacation right now. Just wait till you meet Henrik. He's nuts as you say. Uhm, excuse me. Who is Henrik? Henrik Skovlykke. He's the brains behind Juicy Boost. -Uhm, what's Juicy Boost? -Don't you know Juicy Boost? The energy drink that makes everyone crazy. You must know the commercial. If you don't hand in that report by morning at 9 a.m., you're fired, Freddy. -What can I do? I have no energy and my fingers are completely limp. Have you run out of energy, and are your fingers completely limb? Yes. See ya! Yeah! The sky's the limit! Henrik Skovlykke's daughter is named Sofia, and she's my best friend. Even though she's 14, and I'm only 10, we're still BFFs. Uhm, who else lives here? Tove and Karen lives over here in number 5. They have cats. They have lots of cats. And then there's the Weirdo from Nakskov. He lives in number 13. -The Weirdo from Nakskov! -The Weirdo from Nakskov! Sometimes there's an extreme amount of noise coming from there, but no one dares to go inside and complain, because no one knows the Weirdo from Nakskov. -The Weirdo from Nakskov! -The Weirdo from Nakskov! And that guy there is called Leon. He thinks that no one can see him. You can't! I'm discreet. I have the ability to blend into the background. Leon himself thinks he's a watchdog, but my mom is completely sure that he's just a gross type who's peeping. Monty, I'm a polite man, so I won't call your mom a dunce. But if I weren't so polite, I'd call your mom a dunce. A dunce! But I won't. He's always like that. Over there Jørgen Ulvemose lives. He just signed his whole family up for scream therapy. And everyone who lives in there are aliens. Cut the alien crap, Monty. Yes, I might have tentacles, but that's because I've read in Cosmopolitan they were the seasons new hip look. Yeah right. And down in that basement lives some neo-Nazis. -Heil! -Heil! -Goddamn it! -That hurt. And over there we have Margrethe and Sune. I think people call them intellectuals. The clock is now 9:30 a.m. It's about time to open a nice bottle of red wine. Then there's Elias Asmussen. He devotes himself to his hobby: To ring a church bell. It takes up his whole sunroom. He's obsessed with bells. And there's Lars Johansen who's a real DYI type of guy. If someone were to fall down a roof and become disabled, he does the work himself. -You're over-exaggerating, Monty! My spleen! And here comes some bearded nuns on stilts. And we also have quite a lot of parkour nudists. Now we're back at your house. Welcome to the neighborhood. See ya. Have a nice day, Leon. Shut up! We can't live here, Birger. No. This is no place for our child to grow up. We'll talk about that later. Let's go. But, darling... The monitor went black! Is it you, Helmuth? Are you doing dog tricks again? Why don't you just stick to rolling over and giving paw? How in the world can such a little dog swallow so much cable? It was right in the middle of something important. There's something about that neighborhood, and Monty and his family family that makes me curious. I used to live in a place like that. For a short while, I was also... happy. Anyway, let's not fall into despair here. As Monty mentioned, another family also lives on DüsseMonty Avenue. The Skovlykke family are on their way home from vacation right now. Look at monitor 3110294. Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! Mom, now Allan's fiddling with the airbag again. Allan, stop fiddling with that airbag! -Don't fiddle, Allan. -Allan, put the airbag back again. -It wasn't me. -Nor me. You can't prove anything. Call my lawyer. Mom, now they're fighting. Allan, Allan, Allan, Allan and Allan, stop it! -Watch it, you idiot! -You watch it! Henrik, will you please wait and check your emails when we get back home? Yes, but customer is complaining about blue poop. Maybe you should fix the coloring agent. Look, Britta. We live in a world full of chemicals. Who says it's Juicy Boost? Maybe the kid swallowed a pack of batteries. Well, the Germans weren't in doubt, right? They're recalling a million bottles there. Is it now the knife is coming, Britta?! Now when I need you the most?! No. We've just been on a little road trip to 12 European capitals, where you coincidentally were called in court in all places regarding Juicy Boost. Yeah... Strange coincidence? Either you save Juicy Boost or... -Or what? -Or be a stay-at-home dad. No way! Not stay-at-home! Not... stay... at... home! Sorry! Watch the road for Christ sake! Sofia! -Hi, Monty. -Hi! We're back home again! Hanne, we have intruders! Get my shotgun! What's up, Sofia? -What's up, Monty? -You're back... Are you okay? You look strange. Are you hurt? What do you mean? What's happened? You've gotten bruises in your face. Right there. It's almost impossible not to notice. Monty, you giant nerd! It's just a bit of makeup. Why do you have makeup on? It's not Halloween or anything. What are you dressed up as? -I'm not dressed up. This is my look. My new look. I don't get it, Sofia. Are bruises your new look? No. It's natural to wear makeup when you get to my age. Wanna play? I don't play anymore. I'm grown-up. We could capture the quins and torture them with a can opener, or play store and sell all your dad's stuff and buy candy with the money. I don't have time. Do you wanna play tetherball then? Everyone loves that, especially my dad, even though he never hits the ball. Nope. What do you do instead of playing? Listen, Monty. I don't have time, okay? Do you understand? I'm having two friends over as well, and we're gonna rehearse a routine. A routine? Okay... I'll be off, then. Stop staring, little kid. He's way too immature! What? Monty, we're playing catapult with washing machine. It's the fad of the year! No, I don't wanna play along. What is going on? I don't really get it. You look down, my son. That doesn't seem like you. You're usually so cheerful. Has reality suddenly hit you? -Sofia doesn't wanna play. -I know the feeling of rejection. I've been fired from more than 20 jobs. But in the end, it just made me stronger. Not physically. That's going downhill. But mentally, I'm a bodybuilder! Go visit her tomorrow. No, Dad. She can't play anymore. As in never ever. Has she lost the use of her limbs? That's too bad for that otherwise sprightly girl. No, she says she's grown up now, and now she only wants to hang out with girlfriends. Grown up? That doesn't sound nice. It's totally overrated, Monty. But you knew it was bound to happen right, Monty? She's four years older than you. But she's my best friend, Dad. -You can play with the quins? -They're psychos. Noooo, they're just energetic. We're playing autumn. We're leaves on the trees. Ouch! Albeit a great performance about life and death. It's like nothing is how it used to be. Monty. We still have our annual street party. Our little gem. Right! We do! It'll be the best street party ever! Son, tonight we'll finish the presentation, so it's prepared for approval at the homeowner's meeting. We'll arrange lots of games. It'll last all day with a flea market and where everyone performs. -Of course! And in the end, there'll be fireworks! Yay! And... and we also need a theme. How about a love theme? Thanks, sweet Dad! I can't wait to tell Mom about this. Kiss her from me. -I miss you. -I miss you too. -I miss being with you. -Sure. I think about our picnic. The one in the woods. -The one with fish cakes? -No, not the one with fish cakes. Not the one with tuna salad, either. It was paleo. What's paleo? Monty?! What are you doing here? How long have you been sitting there? Did you hear anything? I heard something about tuna salad. -Tuna salad? -Yum! I need to tell you something. Dad and I are planning the annual street party tonight. Wanna join us? No. No, Monty, I can't. I have to talk to Dad. I love you, Monty. You know that, right? You love me! That fits perfect for the theme we've picked for the party! Love. Nice, right? Well, I have to get started. I have at least ten billion ideas. A love party. That's just terrific. Do you see what's happening? It's going all wrong now. Happiness is so fragile. It can disappear in the blink of an eye. Helmuth! Enough with the flute, Helmuth! And get off that box. All my personal stuff is in it. Humans are silly. They don't know that you have to fight for the important things in life. Stop embarrassing yourself. Can't stand being out of the limelight for a second! Let's see how things are going at Monty's house. Love... love. There. Perfect! Let's see how things are going in the neighborhood. Dear, Henrik. Good night, Sofia. They really are psychos. And there's Leon. He can't see me. He can't see me. Or... can he? Way to go, Monty! The plan's looking good. -Isn't it? -A love theme. I think I'll write a song. Kirsten, where have you gone to No, it's not quite there yet. Why did you stop playing the guitar, Dad? Because we had you, Monty. -Sorry. -That's the way life goes. I had a family to support. Yeah, and you perhaps smoked too much weed. You slept 14 hours a day. Let's say I did it for the family. It sounds better, I think. Thorbjørn, can we talk when you're done? My beloved woman. The woman whom I trust and who'll never let me down. You deserve a song. Honestly, Thorbjørn. You're right. I'm all lalala tonight. That's a problem from a creative standpoint. Can we talk? Dear, Monty. Dad's been naughty. I'm going to be scolded. -Good night, my beloved boy. -Good night, Monty! Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad. We'll organize the party tomorrow. Kirsten Today was just 1000% perfect and tomorrow will be even better! Life's looking good for me, Monty-boy, and everyone I know! Good morning to the entire world! Mom! Dad! Hey, where are you? Hello? Yoo-hoo? Mom? So you're the one who are using the blow-dryer without asking. And don't use my toothbrush either! This is your last chance. Next time I'll fly into rage! Dad? There he is. Good morning, Dad! Let's plan the party. The meeting is already on Friday. All the colors are gone. No, they aren't, Dad. There's only the sounds of death and pain remaining. Is it me you're talking about? My song is beautiful, isn't it? Now I'm suddenly losing confidence. Maybe I should quit singing and just stay quiet. No! You're good enough, Finn! Remember what the coach said. You suck at singing, Finn. You suck. No, the other coach! You sing beautifully, Finn. You can surely conquer the world with your chirping. That's the right coach! I'm unstoppable! What's wrong? She left me after 22 and a half years. She doesn't love me anymore. She said the spark was gone. Too much of DR2 and heavy red wine. Who left you? Your mother. My goddess. Miss Sunshine. What? I don't understand. Your mom... She's met another man. His name is Pierre. Pierre is super buff. He's a CrossFit genius. A superstud. -A superstud? -Yeah. Who can beat a CrossFit guy? He can lift heavy iron balls and do 400 pushups, and I can't even bend my elbow once, because I injured it filling my pipe. And his name is Pierre. It's such a beautiful name! Are you getting a divorce, Dad? I don't know what will happen. Maybe you can try and talk her out of it. She's at Urban CrossFitters downtown. I'll do it, Daddy! Thank you, Monty. I'll get Mom back home again. Kirsten... Kirsten, I love you! That's it then. I just knew it. People have too many options. That's why they get divorced. Danes always want something else. Love can be too hard. They'll regret that they got divorced. They'll end up alone. Alone with the memories. Alone and abandoned with a very weird dog. Helmuth, switch off that helicopter! It's extremely dangerous. Down, you dumb mutt! Allan, Allan, Allan and Allan. Put out the torches. Mom saw us. Good morning, dear. Juicy Boost isn't making any money. We're gonna hit rock bottom. -No. Don't worry about that. I will work more and make lots of money. -What should I do then? -Be unemployed, right? We'll fire the cleaning lady and all the other help we have, but it won't harm you to keep house. Right, darling? I can't stay at home and do gardening and clean the house, bake cakes and be a soccer-dad. I hate gardening! It symbolizes the middle-class. And dusting is for losers! It's just a horrible, horrible thought! Oh, it's a goddamm pity that the world isn't ready for Juicy Boost! Cleaning and doing housework is not that bad, okay? Get a grip, Henrik! But I can't, Britta! Traditional gender roles are in my blood! That guy is a superstud. Monty! It's so great to finally meet you! Is my mom here? I'm Pierre, a superstud. You look like a healthy little boy filled with potential. We'll turn you into an ultra fit and ripped version of yourself. Remember, kid, it's completely okay to be fat, just like it's completely okay to have failures and being unpopular. I'm joking! -Hi, sweetie! -Mom, what are you doing here? Monty, I'm so sorry I wasn't there this morning. Monty must be furious and really crushed over what's happened. Hey, big boy! I forgot to post you on Instagram. Uh, it's really a beauty. -Are you getting divorced? -No, buddy! We just met! I'm talking to my mom, you mega douche! Easy now. -Would you give us a minute? -Sure, babe. I'm so sorry I wasn't there this morning, but you have to understand... Wooh! Yeah! CrossFit! Don't you love Dad anymore? Not in the way I want to in order to stay married with your Dad. Yeah! But we're supposed to have the street party. Can't you talk it out or something? Do you seriously want to be together with that? Yes, that's what I want. Pierre is my new man. I totally love you, Kirsten! You're my world! I'll design a workout program for you, baby. You're a big turd! And I hate you. -Uh. No, Monty! -I'm outta here! Come back. No, Monty... I'll be darned! That was a 30-pound kettlebell. The kid has talent. If he works out every day for five-six years, he'll get tons of Instagram likes. Damn it! It would have been great if I could write a song again. Hi, Thorbjørn. We're playing driver's test. I'm the examiner. Turn left, Allan. And right! At the same time! What's going on?! Hanne, get my shotgun! So much fun, and I'm so down. My phone... Kirsten! Kirsten, is that you? Hey! I was just passing by on the street. Then I heard Calypso, and I thought: Am I in the Bahamas? Where's the pool? I'll have a Piña Colada! Please! It's just my ring tone. I just thought for a second we were in the Caribbean. Back to the office. Is that you, Kirsten? Dumpling? Are you coming home to cuddle? Hello, Thorbjørn. This is your bank. We understand that you're divorcing. Really? I don't even understand it myself. We're informing you about your economy. As things are now, you can't make your next mortgage payment unless you find a solution. Do I have to sell my house? You could also check out other sources of income. I'm just spitballing here: as a juggler perhaps? -Juggler? -Yep, it's just a suggestion. As far as I understand, you throw some balls in the air. Many people find it impressive with many balls at the same time. I think I can juggle one ball, but if there's more than that I'll faint. Alright. Let's drop the whole juggling thing. -Bummer. -But how about renting out a room? A room? Yes. You do know what a room is, right? It's in most houses and flats. -Oh that kind of room. -Yes, that's a deal, then. You abandon your juggling dream, and rent out a room instead. Nice talking to you. Have an excellent day. Bye. Bye. Stupid, mean mom! She's as stupid as old sour buttermilk with big fat stupid lumps in it. My beautiful bicycle that I inherited from my beloved uncle Tage. Oh shut up! Hey, crap cat! That's my dad's dandruff shampoo with tar! My dad's in a total crisis! The last thing he needs is more dandruff! Got ya... almost! As if it isn't humiliating enough to take on a tenant at 49, now my dandruff shampoo's gone. Well, I'm gonna post an ad for tenants. "Learn Chinese. 80 Euros per lesson." "If you already speak Chinese, it's only 60 Euros." I can't take that down. It's a great offer. "Sign up for experiments with Ebola." "Donate all your organs before you die for a case of beer." "Cheap spoons. Only 1200 Euros for two." I wish I had the money. "Brand-new bike from 1985 sold for the lowest bid." They're all so important. I can't take any of them down. I wish there was an easier way to find a tenant for a 25-m2 room with a kitchenette and south-facing balcony! I give up. I'll never find a tenant. I'll have to sell the house and make a living by eating my own dandruff on the street. Am I on candid camera? Come here! What the... Oh wow! Vikings! They had the coolest helmets. They could prick you. The vikings were like bees. And dinosaurs! They sure had short arms though. It must have been hard to dance around the Christmas tree. Wow! A mummy! What are you doing here? No... Hey, where are you going? No, stay. Stay here. Open the door. Open, I said. Open! Here I come! Don't break anything. I gotta get outta here! Come back here! I'll end up in a trailer park all by myself. I'll never get to hold a woman in my arms again. My Kirsten... Yes? Hi. I'm Elsebeth. I'm a 22-year-old from Horsens. I like horses, handball and Rasmus Seebach, and I've just started studying to be a nurse. I dream of saving the world, and I'm clean, conscientious and caring. Uhm... You've lost me. Oh, right. Stupid. Stupid. I saw this down at the store. It's horrible. I'll never find a tenant. I'll have to sell the house and live all alone. I'll take the room! Don't you want to see it? Is it filled with moldy leftovers and used Q-tips? No. Are there nail cuttings lying everywhere? Is the floor like covered with bogies? Are there a bunch of towels that smell of wet dog? No, but there's quite a bit of crushed dreams, a broken heart and a karma that has lost all color. Ha! I'm used to that. I'm from the country. I'll take the room. This is Kirsten's old office. She wanted to be a body therapist for a while. She also wanted to be a fashion blogger, yoga instructor, biodynamic florist, consultant on Candida issues and do something in ceramics. But nothing ever came of it. There's an odd odor. Kirsten also wanted to make lotions. She's an angel. But now she's gone. You're... you're crying. I'm generally easily moved to tears, but since Kirsten left me, I cry more often than not. I've never seen a grown man cry. I'm from the country. I'm sorry. I understand if you don't want to live here with all these tears. Are you okay? Or has all the heartbreak paralyzed you? No, no. I don't mind. So when are you moving in? I was thinking... How about now? Welcome then, Elsebeth. He's nice! Uh... I gotta get away! I'm still a little scared. Phew! That was close. What kind of trouble are you up to? It looks ridiculous! We're into land-based snorkelling. It's good to be underground. Very refreshing in the head. Land-based snorkelling ought to be banned by law! I've always said so! If you're gonna be a stay-at-home dad, I think we should practice some routines. Uhm, what's that? A magic box that humans call "the dishwasher". And I'm supposed to fill it? Britta speaking. You know what, I think we should write it off in Q2. Bye-bye, Henrik. I'm back. You know what, let's offer them 50.5 billion Euros for... Okay, okay, okay. "Detergent dosage..." Piece of cake, Britta. I'm all done! Filling the dishwasher, that is. Well done, honey. Haha. Yeah. Oh my God! Bummer! How can I help my dad? Psst. Is the weirdo out there? -Monty! -He's after me. No, there's no one here. You won't believe what happened to me. I was just in a different world that is right here on our street! Is anything wrong, Sofia? My dad's business is going bankrupt. Now he's just a lousy house cleaner. My mom and dad are getting divorced. My dad's completely broken, and my mom's in love with a superstud. She ignores me, and you won't play! Everything's falling apart. Oh, Monty. I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I could just help Dad make Juicy Boost great, so he can be his old self again. That's what I'm gonna do! I'll help my dad! Thanks, Sofia! I don't have time to play anymore. I don't play anymore! Oh my God, are you slow, or what? Monty doesn't buckle just like that. If only the same was true for adults. Even though Monty is struggling, struggling alone won't do it. I once knew a girl Monty's age. A girl. Her name was Petra, and Petra's parents were very much in love, but time went and love turned into complacency. One day, Petra's mom met a man at a wild Christmas party. Jimmy was his name. Her sweet husband were very surprised and had a hard time controlling his temper. Then one day the man attacked Jimmy. Sadly, Jimmy was the Jiu-jitsu and kickboxing state champion. He defended himself by kicking the husband in the face. The husband was defeated. He gave up and got a job far away from everyone, where he could sit completely alone. You've probably guessed it. It was me who were once a father and a husband. I lost it all, because I gave up! It's been 20 years. Monty, I hope your parents aren't as stupid as me and Petra's mom. I miss Petra. Come on, Monty! Dad, Dad, Dad? I'll fix everything! It would be easier just to die, be cremated. -What? -Turn to dust. I'd be great at being dust. My mouth actually already feels a bit dry. Nonsense, Dad! Alright, Monty. Here we go. Hi, Monty, wanna play? We're playing society. -Where every single person... -...depends... ...on each other. I'm a capitalist. I don't have time. I'm going to the homeowners' meeting. Hi, Jørgen Ulvemose. How's the scream therapy going? Sounds like you're making progress. Hi there. Hi, Elias Asmussen. I brought along a bell. Just in case we're so fortunate we need to ring a bell. I doubt we will, Elias. Hello, hello! Monty? Are you attending the meeting? I'm in charge of the street party this year, so I can bring my parents back together. Just like it in the movies! Not a movie I'd watch. Attention, please. We're hereby in session. I assume everyone wants to get home early. -Yes. -Yes. Yes. Very well. I've received requests from various residents, and objections to all those requests from other residents. Here. Ergo, I present budget and regulations from 1965, and let's get to the vote. Those in favor, raise your hand. Let the minutes show that there's 100% agreement to adjourn, and we carry on as per usual. Thank you for today. Wait! What about my plan for the most epic street party ever? Check this out. What? Does that mean yes? Next subject on the list. We usually have our street party, but as Thorbjørn is absent, we can finally strike it. It is hereby decided that the street party is canceled. What? I don't get it. We have had the street party every year. Listen, kid. Leave now, or I'll call the police. Hi, Monty! Wanna play? We're having fun! We're playing bazooka. My bird bath! Ouch! My new hip. It's the fad of the year! It's the fad of the year! Kirsten. Oh, Kirsten. You are a mackerel. I am hot and saucy... I never heard that one before. He does know how to write songs! Yes, yes, yes! I've got it! Dad's gonna write Mom a new song. That's how he'll win her back. And he's gonna sing it at the street party! You're a genius, Monty! I've still got it! I'm throwing that street party! They can't stop me. If you just believe in something strongly enough, it'll happen! Anything's possible! -No, it's not! And if it were, it ought to be banned this instant! I'll bring my parents back together again! I'll do it! Oh shut up! -What are you doing, Dad? -I'm vacuuming. I'm getting the hang of it. Argh! What's happening? You hadn't turned it on, Dad. I was almost done with the entire house. This isn't you at all. Why aren't you fighting for your company? For Juicy Boost? Nobody's buying Juicy Boosts. I'm going bankrupt. I'll help you with it. That's great, sweetie. Do you wanna take the laundry? Not with the housework! No modern woman would do that. I'll to help you with Juicy Boost. That's nice of you, but it's futile. The problem is that people don't want to buy beverages that destroy their intestines. I'll fix it. Stage, tables, electricity, water, soda, barbecue... Uhm... Who are you? Go away! Go away! Call 911! There's a burglar, for God's sake! -Stop! I live here! -You live here, too? Yes, of course I do. This is my mom's and dad's house. You must be Monty. Thorbjørn, the lovely man, did mention something about a son. Who are you? My name is Elsebeth, and I'm your new mom. Or you know, the tenant, but if things take their natural course so to speak... I don't follow you. Are you throwing a party, too? Nah, it's just a light breakfast. I'm from the country, and I just came to the city, so I'm terribly sorry about before. I used to play a lot of handball, so I'm used to solving these kinds of conflicts physically, so I threw myself into it. I really don't have time to get to know you, Elsebeth. Sorry, but I have to spend all my energy getting my parents back together. So if I were you, I'd start looking for another place to stay. Because when my dad's sung his special and heart-wrenching love song, my mom will move back home again. I'm just sayin', because I've heard cheap student homes are hard to come by these days. What an unpleasant child and unpleasant plan for me. Let's just wait until Thorbjørn tastes my muffins. Destiny is a lemon cake and I'm having a nice large piece of this family. I have to get people on board. It can't be that hard. Bonjour. Hi! I'm gonna arrange the street party myself. Will you help me? No. Hello, Jørgen Ulvemose. Will you help me arrange the street party? Hi, I'm arranging the... Will you help... arrange... The parkour nudists! Will you help out? You can do the decorations for example! -I could bring all my many bells. -Great, Elias! But I won't. No one wants the street party. Hi, Allan, Allan, Allan, Allan and Allan. Aren't you up for some fun? -No thanks, Monty. We're going skating on the cathedral. So, arranging the street party alone? Kids nowadays have great ambitions with zero skills. Why were they born anyway? You could help. We have to built a bunch of stuff. I don't do anything without my union. He's right. I can't do it on my own. You'll be hot and healthy. Drink Juicy Boost! -What are you doing? -Monty, I don't have time. But I don't wanna play. I'm busy with the street party. -Isn't it canceled? -I'm arranging it on my own. -Good luck with that. -Won't you help me? We need to build stands and all kinds of things! I don't have time. I'm doing Juicy Boost commercials. -What's that? -A poster. -A poster? -Mhm. I'm doing cool Juicy Boost posters and placing them all over town so everyone can see them. A poster won't make people buy anything. Are you crazy? I actually remember quite clearly the last time I bought stuff. -Do you like kicking random stuff? -Yes! Buy Hard Kicking Boots! Mom! Mom! I want Hard Kicking Boots! Now! We have to get on YouTube! YouTube? How and with what? Do you have any ideas? If I help you, Sofia, will you then help me out with the street party? -Okay. But I'm not playing. -Okay. Got it. No playing. Go get a bottle of Juicy Boost. Hi, Allan! Wait up! -Who? Me? -Or me? -Could it be me? -Or me? Who decided to call you all Allan? Here you go. What do you need it for? Okay, wait up, Allan. All Allans! Take a sip of this. Hey, you! What are you drinking? -Juicy Boost! -What are you gonna do? Catch squirrels on a snowboard! Hello, 911. I don't understand your sounds. You make no sense. This one's yours. -Why, Claus? Just because I look the way I do, I don't want to get all the squirrel callers! And what do you drink after a trip like that? Juicy Boost! Upload it, Sofia, and let's get cracking on my party. Monty, that was seriously awesome! Good morning, Elsebeth. Thorbjørn, my beloved... landlord. I've made breakfast. I'm not hungry. Only for love. How about a country muffin? What's a country muffin? Patty shell, I think you call it over here... I'll go stare at all the family photos from the last 22 and a half years. I lost him before I even had him. Fight for it, Elsebeth! Just like in the handball finale last year. All's fair in love and handball. Give it a nail. Oops. It's actually hard. Try again. Okay, practice makes perfect. Come again! Again. Oh no! My ancient bouncy castle that's been in the family for millions of years! That bouncy castle was there at the time of the Big Bang! That bouncy castle was there when man started roaming the Earth. The Vikings lived in that bouncy castle. Queen Margrethe lived in that bouncy castle until she turned 30. Denmark won the 1992 UEFA Euro in that bouncy castle, and now it's been punctured by the lack of craftsmanship in today's youth! While everyone obsessed about the stupid bouncy castle, we finished building everything. Impressive. -Yes that's a consolation. -Great job. The street party is on this weekend. Unimpressive. My consolation! -What's going on? -That was miserable. It'll never work. We're useless. The youth is hopeless. They communicate from here to there, and create global communities that will change the world, but can they construct four buildings in a heartbeat? Oh, no, siree! Now they'll get divorced, and I'll have to live with a depressed dad. Not the life I was banking on. If only we knew someone who could help us build it. Maybe we actually do. I have a great idea! Ouch. How are things going, Mr Skovlykke? I'm a stay-at-home dad. I'm feeling fantastic. Life is great. Living the dream. -That's an emasculated man, Tove. -A shadow of a man, Karen. Hello? I'm home. You managed the shopping, honey? You're really improving. I spent an hour shopping, but four finding my way out of the store. I was found weeping in the pantyhose section. You bought print paper, paper clips, toner, pens, more print paper. Yup. Not bad, huh? Yeah... Print paper is certainly lovely. But what about food? Is that something we might need? You'll have to be more focused when you do the grocery shopping. Britta speaking. Okay. Okay. Well, I suggest we'll buy up Starbucks and Walmart and merge them. Britta, is it yours? Where's that sound coming from? Hello? What the hell? I don't know if I can do it. Don't worry. We're together. Come on. There he is. What are you doing? Does he always scream this much? Are you terrified of toothpicks? Does he like the sound of it? Get a grip. I'm sorry to barge in like this... Okay, first things first. Why does everyone call you the Weirdo from Nakskov? They do? But I'm from Slagelse. But why do they call you a weirdo? Yes, I wonder why. I never... never really gave it a thought. We're here because Monty's parents are divorcing. That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it's not your fault, kid. But he wants to bring them back together. Wow. That's a great idea! Yes! At the annual street party. But that's where we need your help. We have to do a lot of stuff. -What do you want me to do? But you have to know that we can't offer you anything. Don't worry about it. I'm loaded. My great-grandfather invented the table tennis bat, my grandfather invented the shoe lace and my dad granola. So it's no problem. But you must know that I'm crazy. I'm diagnosed and everything. So we'll call it light duty. Sure. We're not doing it in the dark. This party. Does it have a theme? Love. Interesting. Well, you've come to the right place. Okay, wrong room. Sorry. I'm sick of screaming now. Then check this out. Love! Dad, I'm throwing the street party. Come on, Dad. I'm throwing the street party. The street party is going to be better than ever! Nice, son. I'll try to enjoy it from my prison of mangled feelings. No, you have to come and sing your song for Mom and fight to get your woman back. Get it? That's right, Monty! He has to fight or he'll end up alone with a stupid dog! Sorry! I meant a super nice dog. That sure is a sensitive mutt. Go, Monty! -I'm completely useless. -Nonsense. I'm as useless as a hole-less sieve or a foot stuck in a bucket... Stop it, Dad! I know you can do it. Dumpling... You're right. This is my big chance. There you go! We're gonna party tomorrow and then we'll bring our family back together. Thanks, Monty! I'm all fired up now. A quick nap first perhaps, but then I'm all fired up. Kirsten can't come home. Elsebeth, find a way to get rid of that woman. Nothing must stand between me and this wonderful man. I swear! Things are looking up! My dad's writing a song for the party. Now I just have to make sure my mom comes. Well done, Monty. I'm in full swing. I'm making booths, a stage and decorations. Trust me! Hey, loonie. What are you up to? I'm no loonie. I think I'm considered a weirdo, which is okay, because I'm not right in the head according to all the doctors. Oh, I see, mentally unstable person. "I'm a special case. I need extra attention and extra benefits." If I see you breaking the building code, I'll have the union shut down your street party just like this. Like this! Just like this! Hanne! Thanks, Hanne. That's why we're still together. I agree! We'll have none of that slovenliness. Call them in right away. Listen up, Polish-looking guy. I'm not calling in anyone until I know what you're up to. Not now, Hanne! I estimate the load on the tango floor and backstage to be 120 kg per m2. I'll make a half-tight three-quarter joint, able to carry its own load on four-by-fours with half-thread screws. What? It's incredible! I haven't seen a half-thread screw joint, since carpenter Johansen from Amager Landevej died in 1986. Then watch this! How does that grab you? Wow! Hanne! Suddenly I feel life is worth living after all. I've had an epiphany. We must help arrange the street party. Oh yeah! I just love lifting heavy weights. Let's do something romantic tonight. -Nice! -Let's go out to dinner. Dinner? No way! We have to build up muscle. Grab a protein shake instead. Read more about optimum muscle build-up on my blog Let's watch a movie then. Let's chill. That often entails soda pop and candy bars, Kirsten. Chilling just makes you flabby. I should have known that such a chiseled charmer couldn't love another person, as much as he loves himself. I've been so stupid and confused. Monty? -Hi, mom! Hi, sweetie. I'm so happy to see you. I'm still mad at you. Just to get that straight. Fair enough, sweetie. But there's the street party tomorrow. Is Dad doing better? Yes, and he's got a present for you. But promise you'll come, Mom. I don't know. I'm in a fragile place right now. You gotta come! Or I'll form a close bond with my potential step-mom. Okay, I promise, Monty. I'll come. It's gonna be great, Mom. See you. Kirsten, you're a mackerel. Yeah, that's great. Alright, Thorbjørn. It's bad, but not entirely bad. At least you're giving it a shot. Kirsten, you're a mackerel. And I am hot and saucy! Thorbjørn! Can you give me a hand? I'm writing the best love song ever! It's a matter of life and death! Life and death? Sounds serious. What's up? I'm just moving the closet. Hand me your phone. You need that to move your closet? No, but that's all I could come up with. Can I borrow your phone or what? Sure. You're from the country and we should help the countryfolk. -One second, Thorbjørn! -Here you go. Oh, what bliss to be without a phone. There. Now pop in your head. Oh, Elsebeth, I was so happy to be rid of SoMe and online culture in general. It's just a humble attempt at changing destiny. Smile. -What was that? -One more time. You're a lifesaver. I'll just send this picture to Kirsten and then the man of my dreams is mine. That's what I call efficient womanly wiles. Yes! Give me back my phone. I have limited data usage, and I'm crushing it in Candy Crush. -Impressive, Leon. -Now we're almost ready. Ah, I can't wait for tomorrow. Everyone will be so happy. My parents will get back together again. It'll be the happiest moment of my life. -Can I order 20,000 tons... -Henrik? Oh, darling, that's not good. You went and moved the stock home. -Hello. I'm Peter, the trainee. -Where's Henrik? I need three million units. No, shipped out of Rotterdam by Thursday. By Thursday! -Henrik? -Capisce? Thursday! It's time to seize the moment now. Britta babe! I'm back. But how? I thought you were going bankrupt. Not me, Henrik Skovlykke! But how did that happen? Our breed are marketing geniuses! The quins risk their lives so you can sell shakes that ruin kids' bowels. Who needs bowels when you're young? R&amp;D are developing new products. Juicy Boost with alcohol, for people who need more than just an extra kick. Hand me another beer, Leon. Hi, Monty! Do you wanna go fishing with Juicy Boost? -No thanks, I'm alright. -Angling is a great hobby. Juicy Boost is on a roll. Allergy cases are exploding all over the country, so sales must obviously be high. But what about the street party? It's looking really good. I've caught something! Fish is good for you! Gee whiz. Kirsten My beloved mug! Oh no, my glass eye! No, no, no, Dad! Stop! No! Oh shut up! Cut it! Stop! What, Monty? Does the song's originality make you break down in a climax of euphoric joy? It sounds awful. You're just singing "la, la, la" completely out of key. Oh no, I must have forgotten the song again. You have to write an original song by tomorrow! Promise me, Dad! -Yes. I'll try. It's crucial! Or else, all is lost! Monty... Your sweet face gives me a craving for a jam sandwich, maybe two. Wanna come inside for a jam sandwich? In a minute. It sounds terrible. What's your dad playing at? He has to sing a song. Yep, no problem. He just needs a new vocal chord, that's all. Whatever. What are the quins up to? My, my. It's a gigantic great tit. I don't think so, Ingolf. Sure it's a great tit. It's weird. You think all birds are great tits. Be quiet, Gerhardt. Anyone can see that it's a gigantic great tit. -Good morning. -Good morning. You did it, Elsebeth, you cunning devil. -Hello. -Good morning, dear Monty. I just came to say goodbye. Are you moving out? Isn't it a bit early, Monty? No, no, no. You're moving out, because my dad is gonna sing to my mom tonight, and then they'll live happily ever after, so you'd better pack up. It was nice knowing you. I hope you'll have a great life. Think again, dear stepson. Kisser, my love. Don't leave me. Don't you see how hot I am? My muscle mass is extremely toned. Don't forget I'm a superstud. I've completed 22 ironmen and I never touch carbs. Oh carbs, carbs! Life is more than just carbs, Pierre. I miss my son. What are you doing? The plank. And now? -The wood chip. -You don't pay me any attention. Sure I do. And I miss your son, too. I'm making him a workout plan. Life is more than being fit. Hold it! No one's fit enough. You know Thorbjørn will try to win you back. That's I'd do. And so what, Pierre? Maybe this was a... mistake. A midlife crisis. A midlife crisis? Crises don't exist, only challenges and temptations. Check out my motivational showcase. Satan, be gone! Look. Thorbjørn sent me a message. I completely forgot to read it. He is out to win me back. Huh? Thorbjørn? It looks more like he got married. What... What's going on? He found someone new. He's moved on. I'm here for you, honey. Sad smiley. Hashtag love4ever, hashtag goodlookingman... No, it's bad. We'll do one more. One more. One more. Sad smiley. One more. Come again, Kisser. There we go. Good evening. My name's Monty. Welcome to the annual street party. I'm so happy you all came. You're in for a genuine love party. The kissing booth is open. Come and tango. Tango is the dance of passion. Do a whirl with a rose in your mouth and experience true love. Don't swallow the rose, Jørgen. Have a glass of burgundy, and hug the one you truly love. Cheers. This Dagmar cake is delicious. It's named after you. My name's Hanne. Sure, but if your name was Dagmar. Oh, I see. How sweet of you, Leon dear. -Nice tentacles. -And what a nice beard. -Thanks. -You're welcome. I don't know what type of man I want. One moment it's a bad-boy guitarist, and the next it's a sweet scone-baking guy. How about this type? Just what I've always been looking for. A man with a twist! This is quite nice, right Ronnie? It's going terrific! Everyone's so positive. There's always the odd one out. Any garlic in those meatballs? No, there's no garlic in the meatballs. Any feta cheese in those meatballs? No, there's no feta cheese in the meatballs. They're plain meatballs. Any caterpillar meat in those meatballs? I'm allergic to caterpillars, you see. There's no caterpillar meat in the meatballs. Ugh! No, I'd rather have a hot dog. What's up, Dad? We're making a Juicy Boost booth. Yeah... Your dad is on fire. This is actually a love party. Juicy Boost seems misplaced here. The new Juicy Boost is loaded with boom-boom and loads of alcohol. Party time! Yay! Hey, are they even tested? Hi, folks. I'm making a bundle, so I'm in a generous mood. I'm handing out free Juicy Boosts for all! Our new variant with alcohol. Here you go. For you and you and you. No, no, what's going on?! It's supposed to be a love party! They're ruining everything! Mom! We have a slight problem, Dad. The party isn't very loving. Bring back that loving feeling with your song. Monty, you sweet boy... I... I can't. I just can't write an original song. You can't mean that. Not even for the love of my life. It's all over. You're never getting back together again. I'm sorry, son. No, Dad! Go away! Monty! Monty. I'm sorry. Thorbjørn, you have to sing. That's why we threw the party. I'm afraid the song is hopeless and I'll let everyone down. You won't let anyone down if you just do your best. Do it for me and for Monty. If Monty hadn't helped me, my Dad wouldn't be a success and he wouldn't have ruined the party. I've got to make it up to him. Come on. You can do it. I'll accompany you on the keyboard. -Do you play? -No, but no one will notice as long as I look cool. Fake it till you make it. Come on! Hello! Hello! Please stop. Please stop! What's up, street party! Are you ready for an awesome love song? Good evening. Let's hear it for Thorbjørn! He's totally awesome! Thorbjørn, you look like a hippie. Oh right, you are a hippie. We don't wanna hear your wailing. Someone take that guitar from that fool. I'm sorry. Kirsten... You are my tender kiss when life's a tough ride. Without you I'd be lost, you're my life's tour guide. I've cast my line now, and if you take the bait I'll tell you that I love you in fishing lingo, beloved mate. Kirsten, you're a little mackerel, and I'm hot and saucy. Kirsten, you're a cute little herring, and I'm the chopped red onion. Kirsten, please come home. Awesome, Thorbjørn! Kirsten, you're a hot little mackerel, and I'm hot and saucy. I may be a bit of a mouthful, but you were never fussy. Kirsten, you're a classic beauty, as precious as those in museums. Kirsten, please come home. Thorbjørn, give me a hand, too. -Who's that? -What... Kirsten, what's going on? Oh no, what are those idiots up to now? What do you want? I told you not to chew on my ankle! We're busy! We have to help these people! You're acting up again. Be serious for once, Helmuth! Mom! This isn't my idea of a love party. I know, dear. But your dad's message changed everything, so I'm marrying Pierre. We're on our way to the registrar. We'll never be apart, unless I see a heavy iron ball that I need to lift 200 times. What message? Your new wife is a mere child! -What's going on? -You got married? I moved a closet. I didn't marry her. Kirsten, I don't know anything about this at all. You! You thought up a devious plan that ruined everything! I'm angry with you now, Elsebeth, you devil! Attack! You hate me 'cause I'm a country girl. Take this, you moron. I'm sick and tired of you! I can't see anything. You're pushing. I was here first. It's all your fault. You ruined my life with your perfect body. Why, thanks. Get a taste of this! And this! The sheriff's in town. Hit the ground! We're just partying. Take it easy. We don't know anything. My car! No, no! Hey, you can't do that! The sheriff's car?! Oh my house! Juicy Boost! This is their best stunt so far, Britta. Take this! I want Kirsten back. She's my everything. -Cut it out, all of you! -Who's that? Shame on you. None of you are prepared to fight for anything. You, Kirsten... Uhm... You know my name? Your eternal crave for satisfaction. Self-fulfillment is very important. It's all a waste of time! Pull yourself together! Thorbjørn, you wuss, you don't know what you've got to lose until you've lost it. You have a point. That's exactly how I lost my keys to the filing cabinet. Your life's achievement is suffering from dandruff for 36 years. -Dandruff, how sensitive. Pull yourself together. All of you should pull yourself together. And what's up with this crowd? This was meant to be a beautiful event, but now you're all pissed and acting like morons. Henrik Skovlykke... -A Juicy Boost? Now you've ruined everything again. Stop making money on other people's bowel misery. Life is special and happiness is not a given. You should cherish life's beauty and fight for all things magical and dear. Don't be filthy and disrespectful. Thorbjørn and Kirsten, your son has fought for your happiness. Monty is the only person here you can all learn from. But for the rest of you: Pull yourselves together. Let's go, Helmuth. We haven't got a moment to waste. Kirsten, did you hear the man's wise words? Yes, about fighting. I'm sorry, Thorbjørn. No, I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry, too. What a superstud! Come here and have a country muffin, sweetie. A country muffin? It actually looks quite delicious. So, how did the street party end? Well, Thorbjørn and Kirsten are seeing a couples therapist. We'll have to wait and see, but I have faith in them. Henrik Skovlykke made a deal to stop selling Juicy Boost. Now he's making it big selling the same product as drain cleaner. Leon hasn't changed. I'm watching you! We know, Leon. Everyone can see you. No one can see me. And the weirdo has moved into art. He has a fresh take on identity and masks. Yippie! Maybe I'm not mentally ill at all! I'm just an artist! We have some newcomers on the block. Poul has a big head with a hatch and a strange creature living inside. And then there's Veronika Poulsen, who can't really apply lipstick. Then there's one named Willy, who never makes it into the frame. Hi there, I'm Willy. I'm down here. Tilt down. Tove and Karen bought a pretty different cat. And the quins are still very creative children. We're playing insects that hit the windshield of a car at 180 km/h. It's the fad of the year! As for the nuns on stilts and the parkour nudists are still at it. And me? Well, I had something to take care of. One day I went to see my daughter, Petra, to say hello and apologize. I'm going to fight hard to get back into her life. I hope it's not too late. And how about Monty and Sofia? They're still good friends. Sofia's realized that growing up is cool, but it's also a good idea to take a break from it now and then. What's up, Monty? Wanna hang out? Sure, let's hang out. Let's do fun stuff while we hang out. Sure that's not playing? Absolutely sure. Let's go, Sofia! Oh shut up! Playing or not! It ought to made illegal! Hanne, get my shotgun!
