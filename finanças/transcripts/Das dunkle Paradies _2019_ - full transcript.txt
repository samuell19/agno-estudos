Hello! Look who we got there? Hello Beautiful Woman. - Whoa, awesome. - Get out. So what's going on? - What's up? - Do not be like this! Hi. - Hello. I'm fine? I want to tell you something. So, I have an announcement to make and... "To make a message"... No. I have to tell you something. There's someone in my life... Franzi, what are you doing? Hello, mom... - I'll be right there. Fits. Lesbian? Seriously? - Yes, Eva Hillinger's daughter. - No! - The ones in Vienna. - Really? The Berner told me. Doesn't she like men anymore? - Probably. There are no more clever ones anyway. - It's fine, mother. - It's not about liking... - I feel sorry for Eva. As a mother you have to ask yourself that. What are you asking mom? - What I did wrong. Eva didn't do anything wrong... But you only want the best for your child. And if something like that happens... - Do you have another shot? - Secure! It's all because of the Me Too thing. - Dont talk nonsense. - It is true! I think Ferdl is right. We don't have to copy everything the Americans do. Dad please Well, let's leave it then. Boo! Nose kisses! - Nose kisses? Really? Come here. You look very chic. Do you want a blue nose too? No thank you. - Not today. But sure, Aunt Annie will. - Yes! No, woe! woe! Do it, dad! He would never have dared to do that before. Late revenge, sister! Nonsense, I was so nice! Would you like something to drink, darling? - Yes. Oops You dumbass. - Stand still! Police! - Father! - On the ground! - I didn't do anything! Listen to me I haven't done anything! Crap! Fuck! What shoud that? I haven't done anything! - Stop it, motherfuckers! - Stay calm. It's all good, darling. - And with you? - There is actually... Franzi always works so much. She takes her job seriously. - Excuse me. - When was she last there? - She's just a cop. - Need to make a phone call? Franzi! - I'm still with my e... Annie, you need to slow down. I hardly understand you What? OK. Listen... That must be a mistake. Yes, I'll go and sort it out. "Negotiations for the Deltaprom pipeline are ongoing. Advised diplomats and business representatives from five European countries. Political observers expect results next week. Now for the weather: it's going to be rainy." Greetings, colleague. - Good day. I was just in the area. Everything okay with you? Yes, that is fine. I'll get myself a coffee quickly. And who are you? Post commander Heilmayr from Krimml. Naturally! - My apologies. It's okay. Well, I wasn't there. Can I finally call my daughter? This is Irene. What about her? A gardener found them in shallow water this morning. She was raped and abused before her death. Several witnesses have seen you with the victim recently. Why? Hm? We know each other. We went for a beer a couple of times. - You were drinking a beer? A few times with one of the most expensive high-end call girls in the country? - Yes. Their customers are usually Saudi sheikhs and Russian billionaires. I... I wasn't a customer. Did you see Mrs. Magyari yesterday, Mr. Teichtner? - No. In a text you ask her to meet you. - She didn't answer. - Where were you last night? - Stroll. - Where, with whom? At the lake, alone. - And your daughter? It was with my sister. Can anyone witness the walk? Your criminal record is not without: serious drug offenses, burglaries. In 2009 you set fire to a car. - 2009 was a long time ago. I haven't done that since Mia. - Clear. You are having a child and are you converted? It's not the first time I've heard that. We can talk for hours. Or you say what happened. I don't know it. You didn't meet Irene yesterday? At her house and had a few beers? They wanted more, Irene didn't. - Nonsense, stop it. She was screaming and you wanted the whore to shut up. Don't talk about her like that! - Then talk. I do not know what happened! Franziska? - Martin. What are you doing here? Um... I'm here for Roland. Because of Mr. Teichtner? How come? - We know each other. From where? - This is the brother of... From my girlfriend. I can't tell you anything. I'm sorry. I accidentally overheard the interrogation earlier. You have something? I just grabbed a coffee and... Okay I got it. - I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you that I don't believe that... You never believe that from your acquaintances. Roland used to mess up a lot, yeah. But since Mia's mother died, he's been trying to get his life back on track. Once violent, it always is. Unfortunately. Can I take him home now? He stays. What do you think? No, you don't do that. - Please what? On what basis? Someone once saw him with the victim and a stupid text message? Every lawyer proves that this is not a reasonable suspicion! Then bring me your lawyer! The kid is waiting for his dad! - He might be a murderer! Take care, Francesca. He has to stay inside. But that will surely be cleared up soon. Roli doesn't do anything that cruel. I know. - I know that. He saw how dad beat up mom. He would like that... He would never attack a woman. I understand But unfortunately he has no alibi. - What? But he was out with his boys. I asked them on the way there. Nobody saw Roland yesterday. - What? He told the inspector he went for a walk. Stroll? I do not understand that. - Good morning. - Morning. Have you been up long - A while. How was your family yesterday? Well, as always. Tedious. But... did you tell them? So, the topic was on the table. what of. Excellent. Now I know what you think about lesbians and gay men. At some point you have to accept it. You told them, that's all that matters. It... It... - How? What? What do you want to tell me now I love you. Same to you. He says he just wants to talk to you. OK. I will do that. That doesn't mean you're in on the investigation. I'm just letting you in so he can finally talk, got it? Yes understood. How are you doing? It wasn't me, Franzi. It was not me. Do you believe me? Roland, why didn't you tell us about Irene? Are you guys dating No, I knew her from the agency where I helped out as a driver. I brought the girls to Salzburg. That's where you talk. - About what? Above all. She talked about her son in Romania, I about Mia. How is Mia? She slept in our bed last night. But do not worry. - OK. Distract her, yes? Tell her, dad... We'll think of something. If they lock me up... - Roland. If it wasn't you, they don't lock you up. Please, Franzi. The fucking inspector hears jail and that's it. It's over for them. Why did you want to talk to me? I thought... you're a cop. You know me. Can not you... I'm sorry Roland. I'm not a homicide detective and I'm biased. Bias? You know me, they don't! Merana is a thorough, honest investigator. No, that means nothing. - Sure that means something. Real? OK. Tell me they don't all think, "Ex-junkie, violent? Fit." I can't. Hey... - I can't. Frances, please. And? He says he wasn't. Yes, what else? - Nothing else. Fuck. Servus, Werner. - Good bye. Do you like to taste A dream. Thanks, today is my zero day. What is a null day? Today I eat nothing, tomorrow... It doesn't matter. - Okay... - Do you have everything with you? We never met, yes? I am not here. It's all just imagination. Werner, finally show me. Time of death was sometime on Saturday evening, probably between 8 p.m. and midnight. She has strangulation marks on her neck, bite marks, and genital injuries. And the injuries there. What about it? Battle scars. She fought back. Unfortunately, we don't have much usable DNA. If she's in the water that long... The blood analysis... She was pretty stoned. Alcohol, cocaine... cocaine, really? No, I'm just saying for fun. Is that the crime scene report? - Mmm. She was found there. But she was pretty sure thrown into the water there. That belongs to the Grand Hotel. - Mmm. We found drag marks and an earring from the victim. The colleagues on site are currently interviewing the guests. As a concierge, you're not some random creature that just happens to be standing there. No, you are the face of this hotel. You are ambassador of this noble house. The guest is everything. Anyone who comes to this table is automatically noble. A prince, a queen or... Excuse me, I was told Control Inspector Merana is here. I have to talk to him. It's urgent. Fifth floor. Here you go. Nobility comes in the most wonderful forms, doesn't it? It's just awful. It's always a tragedy, but just before the start of the season? Yes, she would certainly have felt better if she had been killed off-season. I'm also thinking of our guests. In a tourist region like Zell you have to see the big picture. Everything else is naive. - I have to talk to you. - You should stay out of it. I have something important. - Are these the investigation files? Do you know who that is over there? - Well, the hotel manager and... dr Bernsteiner, the prosecutor. He shouldn't see you with it. Say what you wanted to say And then out. They found the body on the lake shore. But she got thrown in back there. That's why we're here. - That's crazy. Roland owns a boat rental, which is less than 50 m away. If it was him, he wouldn't have just thrown her in like that. He would dispose of the body where it's 200 feet down and it stays down. Teichtner was drunk and in a panic. Do you think he's thinking about transport logistics? Yes, because... Doesn't that feel weird to you? I have no idea how that feels, Franziska. I go by facts. You used to be different. You have no idea about this investigation. Stay out or we've got a problem. Clear? Gentlemen, sorry. He treated me like a country bumpkin. But you found something that clears Roland? Martin didn't listen to me. Then all three of them laughed at me. What do you want to do now? If he thinks I'm going to be shooed away like some hysterical woman... Hey, give me your laptop. Serena... Sessima... - What are you looking for? The agency where Irene worked. I'll stop by and talk to them. Is that not dangerous? Is also just a glorified whorehouse. If I find out if she had regular customers... I want to go to dad. I'm coming. Yes... He is so cute. Yes, turn around Yes, yes, exactly like that. Now look at me are you looking for someone - Ah... Police... post commander Franziska Heilmayr. I want to speak to the boss. - I'll take care of that, Raphael. Thanks. Beate Rotner. I greet you. Excuse the chaos, we are preparing our Christmas special. I've come because of Irene Magyari. Inspector Merana sent me. I should look around again. It's terrible, I spoke to her on the phone a few hours earlier. Ah, why? Shall we not sit down? Please. Please take a seat. Thank you Bruno Once a week I call the boys and girls to see if they are okay. Do they have something on their mind? They are like my children. Has Irene been working for you for a long time? Three years She was one of the best. A little idiosyncratic. But that was part of her charm. Some men like that: overcome a little resistance. A little defiance. Are you defiant, Madam Inspector? - I'm sorry, what? I think so. Can we stay with Irene? - Naturally. I need a list of all the recent suitors. You mean our valued clients? Great Ivan. Pop out! Exactly. Very good. I want a list of all clients. We have to be sure. Play it safe? Isn't everything already clear? - No. Teichtner had been after Irene ever since he worked for me. Everyone could see that. That doesn't make him a murderer. Irene couldn't afford this freak. So he took her by force. I'll tell you what, Inspector. If I hit him, I kick him between the legs so that he no longer knows where up and down is. Why can't it have been one of your valued clients? Because Irene didn't have a professional date that evening. All appointments go through me. She may have met behind your back. With a regular customer, as a side income. That's ridiculous. My kids don't do that. - Okay, anyway... What is the most important thing between supervisors and employees? Communication and trust. That's why I'm surprised too. - What? That Mr. Merana didn't tell you that I sent the customer list by courier earlier this morning. Yes. Oh, one more thing. Did you know that we are one of the few agencies with a girls-for-girls offer? Do you remember where dad is? In the hospital, right? Yes something like that. But he's not allowed out until they know what's going on. Do you understand? We're going to see him now. But he has to stay there, okay? - OK. OK. Hey! Hey! Hi Mia - Hello. What are you doing? Come on, Mia. Sit down. Thank you very much. Ah, the lady from the police. May I sit down I can't tell you any more than I can tell the inspector. Also, I wasn't even on duty that weekend. Um... I'm not here for testimony. More for a... general expertise. What? Well, what's your general opinion on everything? Your professional assessment. The concierge is the eyes and ears of such a house. And if the... - Girl, are you sliming right now? Yes totally. But you only slime with people who are worth it, right? For example for their expertise. I'm sorry, I can't tell anything. But drink! We can drink. Tell me it was manslaughter. There are seven to ten years for that, maybe five with good leadership. Just five years and you're out again. If you don't admit anything, it's life imprisonment. Did they understand that? Like, "paradise"? Yes! In the Koran... you know, their holy book. This is how paradise is described: snow-capped mountain and a lake below. Oh, that's why all the Arabs come to us on vacation? We had 70,000 last year. I'll tell you something: Anyone who thinks paradise looks like my cell, I have something in common with them. I like the people You, Poidl... Again because of Saturday night. As I said, I wasn't on duty that weekend. Yes, but your people are talking. And if something is wrong in the house... If anyone gets it, it's you. Yes. - I think... She often had customers. At the hotel. Yes, that's right. That was a dear girl. Dear. Yes, and somehow that also makes them a guest. And the guest is sacred. - Mmm. If you absolutely mean... It was a bit strange that people were tinkering around in the server room. The day they found the girl. Can we have a look? - No, absolutely not. There. Only a moment. - No that is... Come on, let's have one more. On Friday night... I mount you nicely... on my car, and then I go... to the Stubaital or to Zell am See! What did you do? I have secured evidence. You're totally drunk. - Excuse me. I'll put you to bed - I do not want. Yes, you must go to bed now. - I do not have to do anything. I'm just a post commander. You are my kiss commander! You have a flag! - Excuse me. Annie - What? Will you marry me? What? What? - Will you marry me? Do you mean that seriously? - Full. Full, full, Franzi. What are you talking about? Ask me again sober, okay? - Mmm. Hello, Martin. I'll be right with you We're looking for witnesses. Someone must have noticed something. And the hotel guests? - Nobody saw anything. Nobody was suspicious. Teichtner is still the most promising lead. - Yes. He still doesn't have an alibi. So we found his DNA in her apartment. But that's from last week. - Understand. Kind of not very believable. It's so stupid that a kid is involved. Yes, but we don't need to think what that guy's like as a father, do we? I have one question: Is Franziska Heilmayr a friend of yours? Yes why? - Beate Rotner called us. She asked if Heilmayr was really investigating officially. Has swimming helped with the hangover? No. I'm going to die. If you keep jumping into the freezing water... How many degrees is that, eight? - Freezing would be a merciful death. But I'm dying of a headache. You'll see. Did you steal that one from the hotel? - Hmm? that there? No, my friend Poidl gave it to me. "A real detective needs a legal pad." Yes. And a magnifying glass. I'll be out on the jetty for a moment. Do you want to go on a boat trip? - Yes. - Electric boat or pedal boat? - Look at that. - What are you doing there? Crap. Who is this? I mean who was that? A pimp snooping around Rotner's turf. So what was left of him. - The Rotners? The ones from the escort agency? She is a legend in the red light district and has excellent contacts in the underworld and in politics and sits on enough blackmail material against everyone. Why are you telling me this? Because you think it's great to chat with her! Do not scream. - I scream as I want! You have no idea what's involved in this case. You mean Rotner had Magyari killed? It does not damage your own goods. She's not that stupid. But she and her friends can harm a blue-eyed country cop. Okay, that might not have been that smart, but... That was completely insane! - Yes, perhaps. And the damage to your career... You should listen to me too! You're about to scream again, but first look at what I found, okay? Please tell me you didn't confiscate evidence without orders. Borrowed only. Irene is nowhere there. - Yes, but look. This is the walk on Saturday night at 10 a.m., at the time of the crime. And this is him on Saturday at 10 a.m. And that Sunday evening. Just look. If you look closely, the image section is much narrower. And only shortly before and shortly after the crime. The same for the garage and the elevator. You only notice it when you see all three side by side. I don't know what that means yet, but maybe there is... Someone cut away the timecode and replaced it with a new one. Someone manipulated the videos. Mmm OK. - Herr Loacker will be with you shortly. - Yes, thanks. Our forensic scientist and an IT specialist will be there in half an hour. Please let her into the server room, will you? - Mmm. We'd better wait in the fresh air. You have cold hands. We'll go home and make something warm. It is. That sure fits well. I dont want that. Excuse me, you're Franzi's mother, right? Yes. - I know you from the photos. And you are... I am annie And this is Mia. Hello to you So dear. Can you say hello? I'm Franziska's girlfriend. - Were you school friends? What? No, I'm her friend. Funny, I actually know all of Franzi's friends. There aren't many. How do you know each other? From work. We have... That's nice. I... I have to go. Goodbye come on mia Take care. Come on now. A strange person. She doesn't look like a police officer. Maybe she arrested Franzi once. Bibi, what are you talking about? Come on, let's go Quite a lot going on for the season. Well, when there's a business meeting in Salzburg, all the bigwigs come to Zell at the weekend. And the Arabs like to be there in November anyway. How come? It rains most of the time. Just it. They don't have that at home. They stand there and are very happy. And Zell is happy with her money. Ladies and Gentlemen? But that was quick. Do you think he's nervous? Don't ask me about the pictures. I'm not a technician. This is a whole new system. A computer expert doesn't care. If someone comes into the server room, they can do the rest. Who has a key? - Several people, of course. There is also one in reception. What is this passage? - That leads to our suites. Can we have a look? Yes. But I ask for discretion. It's about the well-being of our guests. - Yes, and about a murder. There you go. Our suites are equipped with a private sauna and whirlpool and you can see the lake from the terrace. There are five suites on this floor? - That's the way it is. According to the registration form, four were occupied on the night of the crime. We heard the guests of the first three. And? Why are you telling me this? Who was the fourth guest? I don't think Humphrey Bogart lives with you. He's already dead. Yes, it's not uncommon for guests to check in under a pseudonym. Oddly enough, he wasn't on the supposedly complete guest list. Every other guest was questioned, just not him. Look, I've already spoken to the gentleman. I guarantee you he has nothing to do with this. Thank you for doing our work, but we like to do it ourselves. Besides, you're paying for it with your tax money. The name. I'm sorry, that's not possible. - Why not? This is a prominent person with a lot of power. A decent guest. Always friendly. Maybe a killer. - A friendly one. Stop it. This is pure speculation. You don't know who that is. I will certainly not support you in this. Excuse me. Listen... - Franziska. We'll get a court order. - A what? A warrant and a notice of cover for a crime. And for the sake of completeness, forensics to take the rooms apart. Your respectable guests will surely find that exciting, just like in a real crime thriller. Chalid ibn Hamsach. Never heard. Does the name mean anything to you? - No. But the way Loacker is acting, he is a big shot or a rich man. So Rotner is involved in the cover-up. Or would Irene have had such a high-ranking client behind her boss's back? No, but she'll keep her mouth shut. We've been struggling with that for years. And what do we do instead? I'll see what I can find out about him. - Hello, Mia. - Hello. Annie? What is? What happened? I just met someone - What? Whom? Your mum. I introduced myself. Don't worry. She didn't check anything. Your secret is safe. But Annie... I screwed up. - Yes. I'm sorry. I was afraid of how you would react. How do I react? Is it my fault now or what? - No. Why are you fucking proposing to me when you can't even say you have a girlfriend? I'm sorry. I was a coward. The whole family sat there and cracked lesbian jokes. What should I have done? Tell them they are narrow minded. Not now! This is still my family! And what am I? A distant acquaintance? Not argue. Excuse me, Mia. We're just talking for a bit. That's not fair. - Not fair? Sure, that's why you still have your apartment in Krimml. backup. What backup? We live in a 40 square meter hut with your brother and the little one. I'll work my ass off for Roland. I'm risking my job for you! - Yes. You are the great heroine. You do everything for me Except admit that I exist. We are closed! May I introduce: Chalid ibn Hamsa. Businessman from Saudi Arabia. He's not that connected politically, but his family is. Especially his father. That's the. Hamsa bin Talal is a big name internationally. - Nice for him. - Well. The junior didn't inherit his political talent like that. He is considered a bon vivant and likes to be in Austria, Germany and Ibiza. Now it comes: Two years ago he rented a villa in Salzburg. The neighbors called the police when they heard screaming. Cries for help, cries of pain, everything. The colleagues met the sheik there, in the company of a young woman, Sabine Nastnak. There isn't. Was she hurt? One does not know. She refused contact with the police. What do you think he paid her for the silence? Or they threatened her. She is said to have moved to an unknown location. Who believes it Or maybe we just didn't find her body. And what now? Are we interrogating the guy? What do you think will happen if we show up to him with no evidence? He denies everything and will be on the next plane tomorrow. We have one shot at confronting him, yes? Yes? "Negotiations on the pipeline have resumed after a two-day hiatus. According to reports, the Belgian delegation under State Secretary Mathis Benoit suspended the talks. This was triggered by demands..." - Anchor? - Man, the Merana! Servus, Franzi. - Howdy. What are you doing here? Fresh from vacation. chic, right? No, what are you even doing here? - Oh I see. I retrained after the little misunderstanding in Krimml back then. The one where you withheld important information in an investigation? Yes, stupid story. But I like it here. And the uniform... The rabbits are really into it. Ah, all together again. Like the three musketeers! We're here because of Roland Teichtner. What happened? Your prince wanted to run away after the medical examination. What? He made it ten meters. The colleague will take you there. I wish you a lot of fun. Tell me, did they shit in your brain? You're such a jerk! I just had to go to Mia. And then? Did you want to be on the run for life? That's what a child needs. Great for development! I didn't go for a walk that evening. I was in Irene's apartment. - I'm sorry, what? Why didn't you tell us that right away? I thought that made me suspicious. No, you idiot! Lie and run away That makes you suspicious! Mr. Teichtner, why did you meet Ms. Magyari? Roland! I sold her something. A little bit of coke. She needed it to put up with the motherfuckers. Did you deal? I thought you stopped Or is that for Mia too? - I want to be able to offer her something. If you need money, you could have asked us. Don't you think Annie would have helped you? Or I! - I don't need alms. What you need is a brain! - So you were in the apartment. Did you consume together? - No. We wanted something to drink, but then her boss called and had to leave right away. A car picked her up. - Can you describe that in more detail? A black 7 Series BMW. She got in, then I didn't see her anymore. Tell me one reason why we should still believe you. Tell me Shit, shit, shit. Crap! And now? - Roland is a complete idiot. And a liar, a dealer, and an asshole, but... I still don't think he's a killer. No, unfortunately neither do I. So? Let's move on? Let's move on. Good. Yes, thanks. Take care. A colleague who followed the emergency call is no longer with the police. The other is on sick leave and calls back. God... - Do you have anything? I do not know yet. There maybe. You can see the entrance to the garage. - Yes. And the... This could be the car Roland described. - Yes. Black BMW 7 Series Sedan. I can't read the license plate. Is that a P or a B? A B I think. - Okay, I'll try. No ok Wait, I'll try P. And if it's a 3, not a 9? - Ah yes. Amber. Florian? How are you doing? I don't know. And you? I'm sorry about yesterday. - No, I'm sorry. I like living here. Is okay. I was just wondering if that's what you want. What do you think? Us. Come on Annie It didn't turn out, but I'll tell you. It's been like this for two years. - It is... It's not just my family. I... I was always the outsider. I was the fat kid in the class, four inches taller than everyone else, and shy too. I was the one who isn't quite normal. What does that have to do with us? Oh well... That would be me again, right? What do you mean by that? I beg you. In the area? A cop dating a woman? How do you think everyone will talk about us? The family, the colleagues, my dad's colleagues. All. What is so bad about it? Franzi, you're not a school child anymore. Do you understand that? - No, you don't understand. But. I understand perfectly. But, you know what? Pick up a nice man with whom you will produce 1.5 grandchildren, buy a house with a garden gnome and have the most normal life of all. This is open to you at any time. No I do not want this. And what do you want? I want you. Are you sure? - OK. - Aunt Annie! Good to know. It's out of my hands. Florian, there are inconsistencies. - Which? A strange camera angle and a disturbance of the peace a few years ago? Teichtner's guilt has not been proven. And Franziska... Heilmayr? The one who should stay out of the investigation? Martin, I value you as an investigator. But you're getting lost. You won't rest, will you? - No, I will not. Martin, you have nothing in your hand. You just follow your feelings. I can still get a day out somehow. But then it's over. - Thank you very much. I'll take the Heilmayr with me as support. Do you have a new car - You don't treat yourself to anything else. Good bye. We must confront Ibn Hamsa directly. This is our last chance. I have a friend for you! Hello! Hey you there! Hello! We have a nice room here. Such a lovely girl... the mia So dear. What did you say? It would be a shame if something happened to her. Challas. Chalid ibn Hamsa. I am very pleased, sir... - Control Inspector Merana. Heilmayr, post commander. Mr. Loacker said it's about this terrible story with the young woman? How can I help you? Actually, we wanted to talk to you about Mrs. Nastnak. - Ah... Why did she scream? - There's no way I can tell. - Why not? Because it's about their privacy. But I assure you, nothing unseemly happened. And the calls for help? According to your colleagues, did the lady seem needy? That's not what it is about. - We want to know... The real question you have is: Did I do something to that poor young woman on Saturday? I assure you that nothing in this life would be further from my mind. Where were you on Saturday night? In a video conference with my father's business partners. From about eight in the evening until one in the morning. Because of the time difference. - Can anyone testify? Of course, eight business partners in seven different time zones, my bodyguards, my secretary, the staff at the hotel. I think there's a recording of the conversation. OK, I need the contact details. We need to verify that. Naturally. - Excuse me. Thanks. Anchor, what is it? Servus, Franzi. Congratulations! What? - That's the Ankerl magic. As soon as I get close to a case, it's solved. Anchor, what are you talking about? Your suspect wants to make a confession. Franzi? Why did you lie? Well, it would have been stupid if I hadn't tried it, right? Is correct. But why don't you see it through to the end? Pangs of conscience. Prank someone else Can I make my confession? Yes. I am Irene Magyari's killer. I raped and killed her. It was me. I do not believe you. Annie is right. You're struggling to fit in. That you are one of them. Adapted, unobtrusive. Of course the sad outsider moves with you, you are one yourself. What a sick psychopath you are. She fucks my sister. She's embarrassed. Franzi, you better go outside. That `s not worth it. OK, Mr. Teichtner. Start again. Stay 50 m away. Have fun! Thanks! I can not believe that. He made a confession. With perpetrator knowledge and everything. Someone could have given him that. - Yes? Who, where? When? - It wasn't Roli. Please do something Talk to him before he goes to jail. Annie, what else do you want from me? - What? I can't prove your stupid brother isn't a murderer. Because he is one, do you understand that? He confessed. I know you did everything... But it's not enough, is it? It's never enough. What does this mean? - You know what? Maybe sometimes I just can't. I can't save Roland. And maybe I can't say anything to my family. It would be great if you would just take a break and not keep asking me for something! Pack your things and go. What? If I'm such an impertinence, we'd better leave it alone. Do you want that for real finally go get out of my house please - Get out! Hello? Tell me, do you have a bird? What was the matter, Franzi? Why are you in the ice cold water? You almost died I do not believe that. I can already see the headline: "Crazy cop swims naked in freezing lake and nearly dies". Dad, that's enough. Also, that's way too long for a headline. Did you have anything to drink Or took something else? - Please, Franzi is a police officer. And who smoked weed and was Mr. District Police Commander? Just because you and the neighbor... - Because you were stoned all the time! Franzi... Do you have a broken heart? Is there a man You know what? Now you just relax. And then I know something to look forward to. On Saturday they celebrate Grandpa's rounds at the Knierzingers. Do you know who's coming? Jurgen. Mom please stop - He's apparently single again. He's graduated and it's only a matter of time... - What's wrong with you, Franzi? - Yes... I'll rip it open right now! Then we'll get married the next day, build a house... and have 1.5 children! And you give me the right garden gnomes, okay? And every Sunday we eat cake and gossip about people. I need a schnapps. - Franzi, what's so funny? Everyone needs someone. I have who Real? Oh... Just not a man. Well, it will hardly be a koala bear. No. A woman. You don't want to tell us that... that I what? - Nonsense, she had a boyfriend. I'm into men and women. What, at the same time? Crazy... You can't do that now. Yes I can. Oh great. Mother please Well done. Now we can listen to something from the people. But you probably don't care at all! Not seriously. I need to talk to Roland. You, it's not that easy. I do not care. I have to talk to him. How come? He admitted everything. - Just it. And why exactly? If he admits everything, there's no chance he'll come home to Mia. Yes, but... - But nothing. Unlike me, Roland always knew who was most important to him. Namely his child. Even if he had killed the woman while she was drunk, he wouldn't admit it because of the little ones. Anchor, please. How long do we know each other? - I really can't, Franziska. I've got enough stress over the inmate I lost. You have something? - Well, not myself. We had one in Teichtner's cell at short notice. He was transferred. But nobody knows where. And what was his name? That's problem number two. It doesn't show up in the system either. Nobody knows who he was or what his name was. Who does the dirt stick to? At colleague Ankerl. What... That was in Roland's cell? Anchor, please. I have to talk to him! It's not possible, Franziska. Good Lord, it just doesn't work! Please, Anchor! - Take care. I can go alone! Everything okay? You blackmailed him, Martin. They put one in his cell who was pressurizing. If he thought he would be convicted, he could also confess. Just look. - What is that? From Poidl, the concierge at the Grand Hotel. What can that mean? The Saudi was the only suspect in the hallway. - Yes. Because only four suites were occupied... - The fifth suite. We're lousy detectives. - Fuck. These motherfuckers! I'm such a jerk Do you believe me? Some important guest is at the grand hotel, gets a call girl and stupidly kills her. He's coked up, not thinking straight, and doing the first thing that comes to mind when he's panicking. He throws the body into the lake, later realizing that was stupid and he calls his people. But the body has already been found. Then the traces are erased. The hotel management helps right away, because the service industry. - Yes. So what do we do? Do we buy Loacker and ask what he says about it? No, when hotel staff are involved, they have been paid to remain silent. And the concierge? - He doesn't talk. His hotel is sacred to him. Then there's Beate Rotner. The cover-up wouldn't work without them. Do you think she stashed evidence? - Secure. And how do we get there? Can we get a search warrant now? No, absolutely not. OK. Everything looks calm. Kind loan from the department. You just don't know. Are you sure? - You said if I find something, Can we apply for a search warrant later? Yes, but we have to find something. - I bother. Do not get caught. That's the most important. Just out of interest: where do you get something like that from? Three years of burglary protection advice. You won't believe what you learn there. Ready? Ready. Cell Sector 2 by Berta. Alarm triggered at Sonnbergweg 17, Serenissima company. Inspector Merana here. I happen to be nearby. I have a look at it. - Actually, a patrol should... No, I'm three blocks away and much faster. Understood. - We have a few minutes. - Excellent. If she has anything, then sure... Ah! Franziska? - Everything OK? - Everything okay. I just stumbled across... - Shit. - What is? You have to get out - Give me a moment. - They come! Out! Fast That stupid alarm system again! Better. shall we have a drink? - Gladly. - Are you so sweet? - Cognac? - And brandy, please. That went better than we thought. - Very cooperative. - The case would be closed. Let's hope so. Look who we got there? Drive! drive! drive! Fast! Shit, shit, shit. Drive! Hey! Stop! Hey! - Fuck. - What is? I have to make some phone calls. - What? Now? What time? I recognized the guy, Franziska. I've worked with him before. - What? Do you know what time it is? Haven't your bosses gotten you out of bed yet? You are in big trouble. Break into the Rotner? What is someone from the foreign ministry doing there? That's well above your pay grade. I'm telling you, you two... - Mathis Benoit. - Who is that? - You know him. Head of the Belgian delegation negotiating the gas pipeline. He should bring millions and jobs to Austria. Everyone is always keen on that. He got a car from the State Department, it's not in normal databases and spent the weekend relaxing with colleagues in Zell. But there is no hotel where he has officially checked in. Benoit did not show up for the negotiations without an excuse. Well, I understand too. Killing a woman like that is stressful. This is absurd speculation. That would have been a scandal and the end of the pipeline project. So one from above decided to solve it Austrian: Shut it up and away with it. Die Rotner does the dirty work on site and you hold up the investigation. At the end we have a drink together. - You only needed one perpetrator. And if Roland offers itself... What do you want to do? You have nothing to convince a judge with. We just have to convince the press. Or you drop the case against Teichtner. Procedural errors, lack of evidence... You are creative, you come up with something. If you go to the press with that, it's the end of your career. I'll take my chances. - You too? The dad! Mia! N / A? Dad, you're never leaving. - No, I'm never going back. All good now all good now Sabine Nastnak has appeared. The ones that the colleagues found at the sheikh. She really moved to Florida - So? What about her? Rather ask what she does for a living. She is an acting teacher. Our Humphrey Bogart really does have a dark secret. He feels called to mime. The father would never tolerate that, so he secretly takes lessons. You're kidding me - No. The neighbors called the police, but it was an improv session. By the way, he screamed most of the time. We did the right thing, right? We're covering for a murder. Hello. Thanks. - Gladly. Was a trifle. My parents know. I told them everything. Also from us. Really? That doesn't mean I expect anything from you. I understand that you don't want more, but... I really want my life with you... I would like to know if you might... So whether we... Will you marry me? Seriously. Yes, Franzi. I sure do. Really now? Don't act so surprised. Yes I want to marry you Hey you bikini fags, don't you have anyone at home? Go to shit. Shall we go out with the boat? - Yes, family outing! Come on. - My dog! - Go get him quick. "Today ended in Salzburg the negotiations on the Deltaprom pipeline. Austrian business representatives are highly satisfied with the results and expect large orders for domestic companies. We are very satisfied with this positive conclusion, which primarily benefits the people. Because work creates wealth."
