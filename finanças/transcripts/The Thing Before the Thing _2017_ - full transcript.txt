- Hi, this is Debbie calling from the Peace Initiative Coalition. I'm calling to let you know that Harris Pierce is retiring, so we are gonna have a huge party for him and we're gonna celebrate his amazing career and send him off right. Please call me back at your earliest convenience and let me know if you can be a part of it, okay? Harris and everyone at the PIC would love to see you, call me soon, bye. - Ready to lose? I've been training for this at least two or three years. One, two, three, four. I declare a thumb war, oh, you're gonna lose. You're gonna lose. - Am I gonna lose? Am I gonna lose, I might win, I'm gonna get you. Oh, you think you're so good. - This is why they call me the scorpion, BOOM, gotcha. I'm gonna get a suede jacket that says "Scorpion" on the back now. Just so you know, you have to deal with it. - Do you have to go? - Yeah. - All right. - Have fun. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome, love you. - All right, bye, boys. Bye. We'll hold down the fort... Yeah? Yeah. Ready to have a party? Alright. - Hey. - And we're off. - How are you? - So I think we're all set. - Great, you saw I put your dry cleaning on the bed? The green shirt, okay. - I did. Hey, I just talked to Larry. I have a conference call on Saturday, I'm gonna have to break away from the thing for most of the afternoon. I'll be in the car. - Okay, we're here. Are you gonna call her or you gonna go get her? - You are way too happy. I was gonna go get her, and you're gonna come get her, too. - No, I'm not gonna go get her. She'd better be ready. - Well, she's not gonna be ready. - Okay, well, then you better make her be ready very quickly, we're on a schedule. - You know I can't control her. - We need to be there by 11, I love you. Make sure she brings flats, not just heels. Not my problem, not my problem. - Meredith, they're here, hi. - Hi. - She's on the phone with the office and it'll be a second. - I'll get that, I've got that. - I've got it, I've got it, it's fine. - Because it's incredibly important for you to actually get this contract signed or you will actually, this is a cliché, but you're never gonna work in this business again. Yes, I mean it. - Lovely, hi. - No, figure it out. - Okay, Becky is already- - Hi, Spencer, how are you? - I need you to sign- - Hey, it's me. You have to sign those papers and get them back to the attorney. I know, I know what you're doing, but you know this is the right choice. It'll feel better with time, just, just sign so we can all move forward, okay, bye. - You're gonna have fun. - How about you and me skip town and go to the thing together? - What thing? - The thing, come with me. - Your ceremony, your weekend? - Yeah. - Oh- - Awwww, yeah. Uh...I...um... - I- I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - I mean I'm not gonna "Yoko" your weekend. It's your group, it's your friends. - Did you just say you don't want to "Yoko" my weekend? - Yeah, I mean, it'd be weird. I don't want to intrude. - You won't, you're good. - I think they'd love to see you. - Okay. - Fantastic, okay. - All right, we're going. - Yes, yeah, I'm gonna pass you off to Zoe. She's gonna handle it the rest of the way. Okay, here she is, all right, bye-bye. - Okay, so I gotta feed the dog twice a day- - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Zoe, I am going to choose to believe in you this weekend, okay, you're gonna be fantastic, all right? - Okay, yes. - Okay, great. - I packed all the sunblock in the bottom of the gray bag next to the- - That's fine, thank you. - I forgot your flip flops, you have no flats. - I don't wear flat shoes, honey. - No, no, no, you're gonna need them, you're camping. Hi, this is Zoe. - Yay, finally- - Hi. - Hey, so nice of you to grace us with your presence. - How are you? Shut up. - And this is you. - Good, backseat, I can get work done. - Also, is she carrying all of your bags? - God, this seat is, three bags. - Okay, well, she only brought three purses, so. - You brought three purses? Are you kidding me? - I have files in half of them. - Are you fricking kidding me? I also told you it was a good idea - Window needs- to budget that extra 10 minutes. - ...to go down. - Really needs to go down. - True. - I need to put this window down, it's so hot. - Can you relax for two seconds? - I have to, just one second- - Before you do that, I need you to buckle your seatbelt. - Hi. - She knew you were gonna be late. - How are you telling me that right now? - She's not even listening. - Are you kidding, no, this needs to be resolved- - Put your arm- - Immediately, buckled. - Put your arm through. - Hi, yeah. - Jesus, are you fricking kidding me? - I have a thing. - Okay. - See you Saturday. - Bye. - Jacob! Jacob, wait! Jacob! - Ready for the big finish? - No. No, I'm still processing the fact that we're all done. - Price of progress, money for buildings, but not for people and programs. If it's any consolation, both Bill and Callie's programs are cut, as well. Don't worry, you'll always have a place here. - Did I make a difference? - You changed a lot of lives, and that was all you, and you gotta keep your head up. You created a very special program here. Oh, and timing is terrible for this, but happy birthday. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Ready for the first one? - Yes, thanks. - All right. - Hey. - I love you. I know you are where you are. I know we haven't been dating for very long. Ummm... But... But I do. And so I wanted to, to tell you. - Let's get on the road, yeah? - Yeah, let's go. Hey, you, it's me again. Please tell me you're coming this weekend, please. I know you're not, but I just wish you were. Let me know if you change your mind, yeah? - Wow, not too shabby. - Oh. - Wow, this is a lot of wood paneling. - Thanks, Meredith. - Oh, there's weird mountain art. Look at these. - Okay, let's put the groceries away. I got home and he was waiting for me on the stoop with burgers, he missed me. - Oh, I'm sure he'll like you even more once he sees how much you've grown out your armpit hair this summer. - You're a jerk. I really like him, we've only been on one date, but I can already see myself with him. Getting married, buying a house, having kids. Whatever. - You still have a few good years left to live, at least six months or a year. - Oh, that's so nice. Mags, it is not a bad thing to think about your future. - Oh, yeah? Saturday night when you were dancing on the bar at Jacob's gig, you were really thinking about the future, I'm sure. - Forget it, but don't let me forget to shave before I see him tomorrow because it's bad. - Ew. - Yeah. - You can't use my razor. - I wouldn't want to. I love you, though. - Stop it, stop it. - I didn't even get it in there. - I will kill you. - Meredith and I were supposed to be rooming together. And we are rooming together because we're sisters, so. - Great. - Super excited about this weekend. - Ummm, there's no, uh, reception here. - Also, how old are you to act like this? - Younger than you, last time I checked, for the rest of our lives. - That is true. - Right? - - But did you guys even read the spreadsheet? Did you even look over it? - No. - Nope. - No. - I did not read the spreadsheet. - Okay, I have actual real spreadsheets to read, as it turned out, stop- - Oh, well aren't you important? - This is important to me, yes. - You're really frustrating me. - I really- - Yay! - Boom! How's everybody doing? - Yay, how are you? - Hey, beautiful. Hey you. - Hey you! - I gotcha. - How are you? Oh my gosh. - How you doing? - I'm good, I'm good, you look great. - Thank you. - Awesome, everybody looks great. So, um, can I show you where you're rooming? You're gonna be with James, and I would love to get those bags in there. So let's either take them back together, or- - Chop, chop, no socializing- - Get out of the doorway. - Okay. - I'll help you. - Becky. - Yeah. - Thank you, here. - Where are the kids, where are the little shits? - Well, Braden is at home for "boy's weekend." Max and Lilly didn't come, kid-free weekend. - Alright, sloppy drunk!!! - Wooo! Let's party! - Well, that was officially weird. - Okay, so you will be in here with James. There you go. - Okay. Fuck. - He looks good, though, right? - Yeah, he does, yeah. - Okay. - Just be careful. You've been down that road. I'm not gonna- - Don't start no trouble without "J-Double." - Oh, James. - How you doing? - I'm good, how are you? - Hey, aren't you looking fabulous? - Quite an entrance. - Hey, how you doing buddy? - And you too. - Good to see you. - Wow. - Great to see everybody, this is gonna be a fabulous weekend. - So, you don't age. - I don't know.

Buh!!! - Buh? I have a solution for that. - There's one- - You guys are gonna love it, I'm so excited about it. - There is no solution for that. - There is. - I've tried. - Stop, just give me a second. - I just, I want to see. - Ta-da! Cellphone-free weekend! - Phone free zone? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Let me be first. - Everyone. - Oh, it doesn't fit. - Denied. - That's not gonna work. - It's a fancy case, bam. - Hold on, mine's probably too thick for you- - Or not, yes. - Okay, are you putting yours in? - Yes, I have mine in my pocket. - One, two, three. - You first. - All right, truly a kid-free zone. - Yeah, okay. - Four, five. - Okay, everyone is putting their phone in, everyone. - I'm not, I'm exempt. - I'll give you time, five? - Oh, I need to get something outside. - Four, three, you better type faster.

Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. - Yeah. - James. - Hey, Ryann. - And Becky. - Hey, I did not know that you were coming. - I know, it was just kind of a spontaneous- - And Meredith. - Hi. - We also just put our phones in a phone-free box. We're doing cellphone-free weekend. So, if you want to put yours in there. - Yeah, I love that. Oh, I totally forgot it when we went back to get my dress. - You, oh my God. - Right? - So funny. That was like, that hurt in the sweet spot. She needs to turn into "Fun Becky" now, or it's gonna be a long weekend. - She's been unbearable this morning. - What time is it? - Well, it's not late enough to drink 'cause I've tried to get her to start. - It is late. - Is it? - It's too late to drink. We need to drink now. - 10:00 am. - I need a drink now. - Okay. - Yes, let's do this. - Okay, let's party. - Let's do this, come on. Don't give me that look, let's do it. - How was this experience for you? Did you feel I contributed to the fullest extent possible? What could I have done differently? - Usually it's me who asks all the questions. - Well, thought I should take the lead, dive right in. - Is this something you came up with on your own, or is it something you read in a book on how to give great interviews? - It was a book. - And what was it called? - "How to give great interviews. - So this is the reason why you weren't able to beat Jacob at poker all summer long. - Whatever, I'm gonna come back next summer and clean up. What is it? - Oh, nice. - Yeah. - Yeah, Becky did a good job. - It's big, huh? - Yeah, well, there's a lot of us. - You doing alright? - Yeah, I'm fine, yeah, of course, I'm excited. - Are you excited? - It's been a long trip, yeah. - Hello? Natty? - Yay. - Oh, Bacon! - Oh my God, yay. - You look fantastic. - You look fantastic, you want me to take this for you? - No, no- - Can you get that? - I just parked, Richard, hi. - Hey, how are you! - CJ. - Hi, how are you? - Great. - Good to see you. - Yes, you too. - I just parked on the street, you think that's fine? - That's fine, that's fine, you have those, yeah? - Yeah. - Oh my gosh, yay. - How was your flight, was everything great? - Oh, it was fine, it was fine. You stopped at like every- - I did, I had too because there is so many of them. - Hi, Becky. You look great. Hi, hi. - Oh, this is the best. - Hi, Mara, oh. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hey, how are you? - Hey. - Good to see you. - Oh, I miss you. - How are you? - I know, we finally made it. - It's really cute, right? - I think it's pretty cute, yeah. And there's a lot of room, a lot of space. Your eyes are watering. - I know, allergies. - Hey, so where are we staying? - Yeah, so you are upstairs, and I will actually show you your room. - All right, I'll bring the bags up. - And then actually, too, we have been doing this, we're doing a no cellphone weekend. Can I have your cellphone? - Are you serious? Wait, what is this, this is aggressive- - Yeah, look at the box, isn't it amazing? - Wow, that's- - So where is everybody, is everybody here? - Everybody's here. Joseph isn't here. - Oh, figures. - Yeah, I'm sure he'll roll in- - Yeah, I talked to him last weekend. I didn't think he was gonna make it, but he didn't want Becky to know because- - He's not coming? - I don't think, he's in Australia, it's not- - Yeah, world traveler, doing all his- - It's okay, it's okay. - It's okay. - We've got the party going, don't worry. - Yeah, no, let's get the party going. Oh, yes, is there something on ice in there? - James, where are you? - This is nice, yeah? - I heard it went well last night. - We really shredded. - What type of music involves shredding? - Kind of prog rock, but like, harder. I mean, we do some covers, too, though. - Okay. You know, I'll make it next time, I promise. Six weeks ago, we couldn't convince you to play for us as we sat around the campfire. But stick with the music. You wear it well. - Oh, good, about time you guys came into help. - Yeah. - Yep, just let us know whatever you need. - Yes, I would really love it if you could start the salad, and I would also really like a nice glass of wine. - No, they can't just cut the funding. We're gonna fight this. - Oh, the Meredith I met on the first day, so quiet I didn't even know she was around. You've come a long way. - Yeah, well, I didn't have a whole lot of choice. I just had to jump right in. With these people, this work, I loved it. I really learned a lot about myself. - Well, everybody respects you for taking charge. But the thing that's gonna take you farthest in life is compassion, like the way you took care of CJ. - Anybody would have done that. - I know, but people like a leader who cares. Hang onto that. - Well, I may have learned a thing or two from you. - Flattery will get you everywhere. Thank you - I'm telling you, if he wants to have sex with a little child, then that's his prerogative. - Come on. - We were just talking about you. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. - Yeah? - And you? - I'm good, just getting some stuff ready for dinner. - Do you want any help? - I would love your help, actually. - What could I do? - I have a feeling that you know how to make a really good salad. - You feel correctly. - Okay, why don't you whip up a salad for us? That would be great. - Okay. - Oh, are we burning the midnight oil? - Sorry. So you just, you wanted us to tell you what we thought about the program- - First, first, can I get you a cup? Black, right? - Yes, please. I was so inspired last night. I found these enamel paints and I just, I went crazy, I was splashing them everywhere. Thank you, it was so much fun. I didn't finish 'til the sun came up. Well, I don't even know if it's finished, but. Sleep can wait, art can't. - Just don't stray so far away from life that you forget yourself. Listen to your heart and your brain. - My art and my brain. - Here here. - So what's your next project? Um. - Oh. I don't know, I don't know. - Are you just getting ideas, or what? - Not ideas. I'm getting "not ideas." - Awesome. - Oh, man, yeah- - And I have been noticing a severe lack of art on your Facebook feed, I will say and a severe overabundance- - Oh, Facebook. - of baby photos, not that Braden is not the cutest baby in the world, but- - He's cute. - It's still. - But, no, that's Henry's doing. I don't put anything on there. - Aggressive with the camera, that's fine. - Yeah, yep. - So no time? - No time. I keep saying there will be time tomorrow. - Oh, how about a colander? - Yes, I can get you one of those. - Thanks. - So how did you and Jacob meet? - Well, I work at this little art cafe/performance venue, and he came in with his scrappy rock-and-roll band one night, and came back the next day. And then the next day. - Well, Jacob seems very happy. He deserves somebody good. I'll be right back. - Just started singing and dancing? - Yeah, why not? Just lots of leg. - The night's still young. - Oh, well, it is, you're right about that, my friend. Yeah- - Is this the perfect night, or is this the perfect night? - It's so nice, it's so quiet. - Quiet. Some pretty stars- - Guys. Could somebody please come and help me in the kitchen? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. - She didn't see us. - She didn't see us, no, nice. - Look who rallied. This big guy. So Ryann was just telling me how you guys met. - Was she? - I like it. - It's a good story. - It is a good story, you can take those. - Awesome. - Just because you're not painting anymore doesn't mean you're not still a painter. - Okay. - Becky's email did not say that I would need to hire a Sherpa. - What? - How the hell are you? - I thought you weren't coming. - Oh, no, I got to change my flight. Really, you look fantastic, this is awesome. I know, I know, I got your text. I wanted to surprise you, it all worked out. How are you? - I was waiting for you to write back. - I'm sorry. - Stop, okay. - Hello. - Sorry, hey, hello, hello, hi. Oh, you look great, how are you, brother? Oh my gosh. How are you? - Good to see you, man. - It's good to see you too. - We should have known it would be some big surprise entrance. - Yeah. - Well, I wouldn't have any other way. How are you guys, what is happening? - Good, you look like you need a drink. - I do, yes, please, where are they? Oh my God, thank you. Oh, Jesus. So is Becky totally insane right now? - She's like in a medium to medium-high at the moment. - Working her way down. - Good, oh my God, how are you? How is- - Great. - God, I suck, how is Brandon? - Braden. - Braden. - It was close. - At least I remembered it started with a B. - That was pretty good. - Yeah. - Yeah. - He's okay? - Oh, yeah. - Good, well, you look great, Mama, this is good. - Hey, guess who's here? - I have no idea, I thought everybody was here. - Joseph, he's here. - What? Joseph's here? - Joseph. - Okay, let's do it, come on. You gotta keep up. - I'm doing it, I'm doing it. - You gotta keep up, no, got it. It's kind of a tradition. I will get this one. I haven't seen him in a while. - Yeah. - Here we go, okay, let's go. - Let's go. - Go, I'll hold down the fort. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Are you sure? - I'm sure sure. - Yeah, how about that. - I will. Oh my God. - Oh my God! I thought you weren't coming. - I got my flight changed. Rock and roll, how are you, what's happening? - Oh my gosh, shot? - Oh, yes, shots, all right. - Shots, more shots. - All right. - Double-fist it. - Here we go. - Okay. - All right? - All right. - Okay. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Eyes, eyes, eyes, everybody got eyes? - It's crazy, down them, one, two, three, go. I'm gonna go finish dinner. - All right. - Oh my God, keep it up, Becky. - This is great, no, seriously, Harris should get awards more often, this is fantastic. - I'm gonna go help her. - It's so good to see you guys. - Will you come with me, I need backup. - Oh- - Please, I can't do this. - Can't get out of it anymore. - I'm gonna follow. - Hey, so Nat said you're not practicing law? - No, man, I just, only so many hours you can bill. I decided to chase life instead of chasing the money. - Good for you, that's great, you feel okay? - I'm good, man. - Good, good for you. - It's good to see you. - It's good to see you too, yeah. - Well, I will see you in a bit, my man. - Alright, alright. - We're getting ready, we're starting dinner in a few minutes. - And that, look, you have to bring me up to speed on everything. - It's all, it's good, it's good, we're here, yeah. - Okay, well, I just want to get a little time at some point. - Totally, obviously. - So good to see you. - Wow. - Wow! - Yeah, the letter came while we were away. - Oh, congratulations, bold move, you'll love Paris. - I already do. - I'm proud of you, CJ, it's admirable the way you're following your passion. That's what this program's all about. 100%, right? - Absolutely. - Hey, girl lady. - Hey, roommate, or I should say bedmate. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, god, I didn't look you in the eye, I need you to- - Oh, cheers. - Yeah, okay- - Is that better? - I can't handle anymore bad sex. - I actually had a bedmate last night. - You did? - Yes, Blake, Blain, Blair, something with a B-L. - You know know his name? - Blaze, Blaze. Blaze. - Ugh, that was the worst of the bunch. - Yep, yep, it's LA. - Yeah, yeah, I wish I had that problem, not remembering a guy's name. - You are a female, so that will work. You go to a bar, that's where the men are. - So you're not in a relationship, then, is what you're saying? - Oh, no, no, I was. Got out of it, wow, a couple months ago. She was just too needy. - Wait, did you just say she? - Yes. - Oh my God, you are now officially my hero. That is completely unfair that you have it covered on both sides- - Meredith. Becky is giving everyone their phones back, so. - Are you serious? - No, of course I'm not serious, have you met her? No, but she's having an aneurysm, and honestly, Mara could really use, yeah. - We're talking about this later. - Oh, sure, totally. - Well, it sounds like I missed something, hey. - Hey, fucker. - What? - What do you mean what, I haven't seen you, what, since Mara's wedding. - It is not- - And I never hear from you. - I have been awful at writing, and I really totally get the worst friend of the year award. But I'm sorry, I'm here now. I've been sent to help. - Oh, you don't need to help, grilling is easy. - Okay. - I got it covered- - Well, fill me in, are you still at the same café? Catch me up. - No, no, actually, I am at this restaurant that's really good- - Cool, that's great. - Very high end. Yeah, it's sort of high pressure. I'm still making desserts and making people fat. - Well, the world thanks you. - Yeah. - Are you happy, enjoying it? - It's fine, it's fine. - Fine? - That is what it is, and what about you? Where were you, you were just in Australia. - I was just in Australia. - And now you're going to- - I am going to Peru, Machu Picchu. - Oh, that's cool. - Yeah, yeah, I'm very, very excited. - Very cool, I've always wanted to go to Machu Picchu. - So go there. - I would, I just have this new job, and it's very- - Come on. - And I haven't been able to take time off- - There are other jobs, just. - You're saying- - Wait, wait. - Quit my job, what? - Yes, I am saying quit your job, listen to this. This is perfect, this is just too perfect. Look, I know you're gonna say I'm crazy- - Well, I know you're crazy. - Okay, we are looking for a blogger, a traveling blogger. - So you want referrals, or? - No, I want you to apply for it, you're perfect. It's practically a shoe-in. Look, I've been at the company long enough that I can pull a few strings. It's not 100%, but you're perfect for it. - You want me to blog? - No, you want you to blog. - I want me to blog? - You want you to blog. - You are offering me a job right now? - I am offering you a job, yes. - You're crazy, this is- - This is what you want. This is perfect for you, you know it's perfect for you, do it. - I mean, yes, I've wanted to travel and I haven't been able to, I've just been, got myself into my routine. But no, no, that's just- - Oh, God, routine. - Thank you, thank you, here, I, grilling is easy. - Grilling is easy. - I'll think about it. - Do not just shrug this of. - It's not that I'm shrugging anything off, it's just, I have a life, I don't know. - "I have a life, I don't know," ugh. - It's not fine, it's theft. - Did you make mix tapes when you were a kid? - Sure. - It's the same thing. - If I make an album, then somebody downloads that album illegally, they're literally taking money out of my pocket. - Figuratively. Unless they are actually putting their hands into your pockets, they, whoever they are, are figuratively taking money out of your pocket, not literally, that's literally the definition of figuratively. - Besides, if they download your music and pass it around, they're making you money in the long run. - Oh, bullshit. - Look at Phish, look at The Dead. - We are not The Dead. - You will be, though, the show last night was jamming, dude, my ears are still ringing. - Thanks. All right, hey. Before you head back to Philly, I was wondering if I could pick your brain because I don't have a head for business, not like you. - Oh, dude, whatever you need, man. You know that, I've got you. - You are gonna be a rockstar, brother. ♪ Ryann, oh, Ryann ♪ Ry... Hey. - What's up, man? - Have you seen Ryann? - No. Cool. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, is that how we're doing this now? - Doing what? - I ain't seen you in a minute. You come up asking for your girlfriend and bounce like that? I'm just saying, man, I mean, we've been boys forever, you've been avoiding me the whole night. - I haven't been avoiding you, man. It's just, I've got my girlfriend, and a lot of people, and. - So girlfriend, a lot of people, you ain't seen me in a few years, and where's Ryann, that's all I get? Look, bro, if you're tripping about the money you owe me, don't, it's not a big deal. - I'm gonna pay you back. - Look, man, have a seat. Have a seat, seriously. I didn't loan you the money 'cause I thought I was gonna come up like it was a tech investment. I loaned you the money 'cause you're my friend. We're not gonna let money come between our friendship, alright? - What kind of friend would I be if I don't pay you back, man? - Look. If you get to a point where you can pay me back, that's cool, I will take the money. But what I'm telling you is, don't stress, alright? We're here for Harris, let's have a good time. He taught us a lot, we shouldn't forget that. You good with that? You good with that? I think that's a yes- - Yes, I'm good. - Alright? - Fuck, yes, I'm good with that. Let's have a good time tonight. - That's what I'm talking about. - Hey. Joseph wants you guys out on the porch, we're gonna smoke some Cubans. - I can smoke a Cuban, alright, I can do that. - I can definitely smoke a Cuban. - Let's do it. - Cool. - All right. - Thank you. - No need, but you're welcome. - So they have computers in Australia, I'm assuming. - They do. - Phone lines, a post office? How can I haven't heard from you, man? Have you gotten anything, have you gotten- - I'm the asshole because he hasn't gotten any love letters. - Yeah, my feelings are hurt. - I know, you want to be the little spoon tonight? I'll make it up. - Oh, man. - Yeah, it's good to see you, man. So what is the deal with tomorrow, anyway? I don't even know what's going on. - Are you kidding? - Yeah, I just know to show up. - Harris's favorite doesn't know what's going on. - It figures, right? - Right. - Oh, he's lucky I showed up, seriously, what's happening? - Well, it's somewhat of a classy event, so I hope you brought some other clothes. - This is all I got, man. Yeah, seriously, the rest of my luggage smells like a yak, so yeah, primate house, that's all I, gonna have to burn it down. - Well, Harris is gonna be proud. - So he's not gonna care. He's gonna be wearing his Birkenstocks, anyway. - He has gnarly toes. - He totally has gnarly toes. - Please be on time. - So we're leaving the house at 11. We're supposed to meet up with Harris hopefully between 11:30 and 11:45, and then I think at 12 o'clock, there's a cocktail hour, meet and greet, walk around. There's a couple other people being recognized, and then I think the event's at one o'clock. Dinner or lunch or whatever, and then hopefully it's over by three. - Does Becky know about this, seriously? I thought she was in charge, you make a spreadsheet too? - What's going on, gentlemen? - We're having a little bit of a sausage-fest. - Oh, I see. - You can have my seat. - Oh. - Aw. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. Look at that, a gentleman. - What, really? - Yeah, I just gotta go upstairs for a second. - You know it's Saturday night, right? - I'm aware. - Dude, where you going? - Five minutes. - Richard. - Seriously, how does Natalie put up with this guy? Seriously, I don't understand it. - He's a good guy, he's a really solid guy. - Workaholic, man. - The guy's committed. - I couldn't be a lawyer, I couldn't be a lawyer. - I don't get it. I don't get it. - Can I have one of those, please, or am I just gonna watch you guys smoke them? - Think you can handle it? - It's a Cuban. - Fuck yeah, I can handle it. Ooh, is it a Cuban? - It is a Cuban. - Don't burn yourself. - You do look good. - Well, thank you, boys. This is nice, mm. - It's the real deal. - I do have to say, excellent job. - Thank you very much, so ummm.... she seems nice. - Oh, she is nice, I like her a lot. - Thank you, I like her a lot too. - Major upgrade for this guy. - Oh, well, that's not hard. - Excellent point. - Well, there were a lot of them between Meredith and Ryann. I like Ryann, she's a keeper. - How's the band, are you still rocking out? - I quit the band, yeah, I quit. - What? - You quit the band? - I quit the band. - Seriously, you guys were just getting some traction. People were starting to pay attention. - I promise you, I was gonna get a night off and come see you, I was. - Dammit, I'm just gonna say it. I've gotta pee like really bad, so... I'm gonna take a piss, see you guys. - Oh, no, you are not off the hook. I expect a full story when you're back. - This is what happens when you inject estrogen into a testosterone-bonding situation. - Oh, please, come on. - You're right, it's your fault. - You're not into estrogen anymore? - That's not what I said, that's not what I said. We were just, it was going good, you know? But I don't mind you hanging with us if you can hang. But I need to top this off, so I will be back. - Wow. - Wow. - Wow. - Dropping like flies. - Yeah, seriously. - And then there were two. - I guess we see who can hang. - Cheers. - Cheers. So? - So, I've been thinking a lot about what you said. Hey, you know what, fuck it, I'm in. - Yes. - I am in! Cheers. - I will make the call tomorrow. You won't regret it. - Wow, that's such a good one. Remember that night when we found those live musicians and then those kids were in the middle of the dance floor until four in the morning? That was so fun, I just want to do this all the time. Every single day of this program, I mean, met people I've never met anyone like before. Everyone's just different, different ideas, different cultures. You know what? I'm gonna come back and lead one of these programs. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'll do. You will just never be able to get rid of me. That's both a threat and a promise. - Noted, I'm sure you'll be quite an inspiration. - Not like you. Alright, we good here? - We're good, and thank you. - Alright. - Alright. - Hold the phone, what is that? - It's nothing, really, it's nothing. - Do not tell me that you were attempting to hide some sort of special occasion from us. - No, I wouldn't do that. - Okay, good. - Don't do it. - Do what? All right, kids, it is time to get this party started. We have been here for too long already, and you guys are up first, lovebirds! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Here we go, I know you're in it. And girl, you came, so now you're in this too. - I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. - Yeah, no, here we are. - I'll take it for her. - Thank you very much for that, I appreciate it, like a rockstar, Becky, get in on this! We need "Fun Becky" tonight, come on! Where did she go? - Please. - Alright, yes, and a little down the boobs, or no? - Oh, God. - Champion. - That's horrible. - Yes, love you, okay, all right, shots, kids? There you go. - What is that, vodka? Is that vodka, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Some kind of fruity vodka, though, what- - A little bit but- - You thought you were gonna leave me out? - Just ignore it. I got you. - long flight, thank you very much. I think you forgot me, oops. Yeah, seriously, I don't understand. - I love you, that's awesome. - You've got a hole in it. - That's amazing. - Yes. - Yep, okay. - Boom! - Oh God! Oh my God, that's horrible! - All right, so where's Becky? - All right, guys. What are we up to? We need some games. - Classic. - Please, finally. - Classic Natalie Bacon. Bacon bonding, everybody, let's do it, games, games! - Wait, wait, wait, what's the deal with bacon? Why are you called that? - Oh, Bacon, for those of us in the group, we call her that because she's "six-degrees of Kevin Bacon", she's Nattie Bacon 'cause she keeps us together and bonded and happy and loving! - And she looks a lot like Kevin Bacon. - And I've got moves like Kevin Bacon, so. - Oh my God, oh my God, I have a picture of you on your birthday wearing the bacon hat, the pants we made you, and- - That's so embarrassing. - What? - I need my phone. - I'm not gonna give you your phone. - I need to show a picture of "Nattie Bacon." Please, it's so funny. - It's a cellphone-free weekend! - Come on. - No, come on, please? - Okay, who here- - Becky. - Raise your hand if you actually believe that Meredith only wants her phone to look at that photo. You guys, are you kidding me? - Yeah. - Yeah- - You see our faces, please. - Yes, so, okay, you cannot deny that. - I'm not gonna give you your phone. No, oh my gosh. - Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! Fun Becky! FUN BECKY!!! - Okay. Thank you. Okay, here is the deal, I will give you guys your phone back because I want to, not because Meredith is asking me to. And by the way, just so that you guys know, the key was always right here. - Shut the fuck up, are you serious? Open it, open it. - I am, I am, geez, you guys. Really, you think that's the only reason she wants her phone? - Fun Becky is back. - What do you do? - I'm a lawyer. - Hmm. - Yeah. - Nice. - Yeah, I started my own firm eight years ago. - Good for you, that's awesome. - Yeah, it was right around when we got married, and so it's been a lot of work, but it's been good. Yeah, it's a lot of work. - What kind of law is it? - Now we've expanded, so we do a lot, but we were doing a lot of kind of small cases, litigation, and somehow, it's turned into kind of, I don't know. - Yeah, okay. ♪ Trace these words ♪ ♪ With your lips ♪ - I just want to let you know the options. I mean, you've got a great skill set. You're a great communicator, you're a great leader. You listen, and with that skill set, you can do a plethora of things. - Well, as usual, you're right. You actually sound like my friend's dad, who says I shouldn't go into law unless I actually love it. Yeah, but what I really love is the idea of helping people with the law, like Thurgood Marshall did, especially for people that look like you and me. I mean, if I can do one tenth of what he did, I'll be good. - Well, the legal profession will be a lot better off with someone like you in it, so follow your passion. - Thanks, I appreciate that, especially coming from you. - Thank you. - No, someone's in here, no, get out, get out, get out! - What are you doing? - What are you doing, this is not a lecture moment, so shut the door, shut the door! You're so- - Exactly. - No, no, no, that is not what I meant! Come on, oh my God, I cannot believe you! - What are you doing? Richard was looking right at you and Joseph down there. That's not good. - This, I'm not doing this with you in here, okay? - Look, I get that you guys are having problems, more than anyone, you gotta talk about it. And if you don't talk about it, no matter how it ends up, you are going to regret it. - I get it, we're fine, it's just- - No, you're not fine, and it's okay that you're not fine. Gotta talk about it. - Can we not talk about it right now? - Just don't want you to make the same mistakes I made. - Richard and I are not you and Jocelyn, I promise. We just, it's. All right, it's fine, it's- - Don't just blow me off like that. - I appreciate what you're saying, and I hear you, and I would love to talk about this a ton more, not while I'm peeing. - Are you sure? - Yes, please go. - Promise? - I promise. - Pinkie-swear promise? - You're so embarrassing! Please get out of here! - Give me a hug. - What, fuck you, no, oh my God! - Get up, give me a hug. - There's no, I need- - You want me to go, give me a hug. - I let you stay for way too long, get out, you were- - You're not gonna give me a hug? Fine, I will sit- - No, no, no, absolutely not! You are such an asshole, oh my God! At least let me finish, this is, ugh, why? - Give me a hug. Wash your hands first! - You are such an asshole! I cannot believe you. - Did you use soap? - Get out, thank you, I'll meet you downstairs. - Hey, you know if you carry that guitar around and you don't play it, you're just a show-off. Come on, Jeff Buckley, what you got? - "Freebird!!!" Wooo! Bro. - Play that song that you played for me last night. - Ooh, yeah, let's hear it, lover-boy. - It's not finished. - Do it, just play it, it's good. - Okay. All right. - Boom! I knew it, I knew it. - What? - Trying to sneak out and be all emo on me, but I found you, 'cause we gonna have some fun, because I found a boombox, old school. It has batteries, it works, I checked. - What are you talking about? - It has a cassette, it's a mix-tape. I don't know what's gonna happen, but whatever happens, it's gonna be awesome. This, this. - Okay, this is about the only song that I would dance to. - One, two, three, oh, what? Uh oh, gonna bring it out! Yeah, yeah, old school, old school! Oh, you gonna get spun! - Ow, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Okay, take two, take two, ready? - Okay, okay. - So on me, on me, okay, come on. - I'm sorry, no, that's my problem, I always try to lead. - Oh goodness. It's not a problem, it's not, we had a great run. And I should have let you lead, but I can't let you lead, and you need somebody who lets you lead because when you lead, it's beautiful.

It really opened my eyes to the world. - So what now? - I don't know, scrap-booking? - You really don't think it's a big deal because it comes so easy to you, but I'm serious, Joe. There's no shame in taking over your dad's shop. Working with your hands is honest work. But these are really, really good. The world needs auto mechanics, they absolutely do. But for my money, you're not a mechanic. You're a storyteller. Your photos capture more about life than just regular pictures, and the world needs that, too. - I should have known. What? Everybody else is at the party, and Mr. "Lone Traveler" is up here by himself. - Hey, I have to set up. - Well, you're being a weird hermit. Can you come back? - Becky would not let me have a bed. She said I'm not on the spreadsheet. - Yeah, 'cause you didn't RSVP, so that's on you. - Well, I didn't know I could make it. - Or you just like stringing me along for the last six weeks. - Hey, I would never string you along. - Who's out there to help with dishes? - Oh, I do not want to. - Get in, come on, get in. - Okay. - Oh, turn off your light, too bright. Ow. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, nope, don't, don't apologize. That was my fault. - It was a little my fault. - A little bit, yeah. - Mostly your fault. - I know. - Well. Um... Welcome to my tent. - Here we are. - Look. Listen, I... I know that things are really terrible with you and Richard right now, and I don't want to make things more complicated. I don't want to make them worse. - You're not, you don't have to do that. It's not even about that, I kind of felt like that was a long time coming. - Me too. - I don't know. I think I just always sort of thought it should have been us. - Yeah. - Yeah, like in some parallel universe, you and I just ran off together. - Yeah, and see the world. - Yeah. - Yeah. Look, I know that I am very lucky and I lead a fabulous life, but honestly, lately I've just been feeling like... Feeling lonely. I really think I might be missing out. You set the bar very high. There's seven billion people in this world. There's gotta be at least one other person almost as interesting as you are. Wouldn't it be great if this wasn't just some stupid little thing that happened one night at a party? - Yeah. Yeah. - Hey. - I need to... I need to talk to you about something. - Sure. - Being up here has, it's reminded me of a lot of things. And um... I've also learned some things since we've been here, and... I don't know how to. Um... I'm fucked up, and- - You're not- - I don't know where I'm going, and I don't have anything, but... Aaaah! Aaaah! Fuck it! - It's okay. - I'm just gonna say it. - It's okay. - I love you. Fucking... I-I love you. - What? - And you don't need to say it back, but... That's um... I just, I love you. - Hey, I love you. - We've got more players, come in. Come in, we're gonna play Celebrity. We're gonna do it this way, CJ, you're up. - Oh, you're on that team. - So we're playing Celebrity? - The ringer, we got the ringer! - Are we doing the cheat round? - Uh-huh. - Elvis! - Yes! Oh, this is like the opposite of Elvis. So he's a poet, and he writes sort of like off-color- - Shel Silverstein! - Not, no, very adult-themed- - Roald Dahl! - No, okay, the first name is like Manson- - Charles- - Bukowski! - YES! - Shut your mouth, shut your mouth! - He's like the hottest man alive. Blonde and really good abs, and he's all steamy and really into Rachel McAdams- - Oh, Ryan Gosling. - Yeah! Okay, okay, the guy, oh, the guy who's in the movies with the dinosaurs right now. Done, okay, and, oh, err. This is, okay, you guys, this is his last name. It's a singer, and the last name is the last name of the people that we met in the Bahamas and then we went and we emailed with them and then we had dinner with them in New York. Think, really, this was less than eight weeks ago. Come on! - I don't know, just give me the clue. - Think about it, no, no, there was a singer, and the last name is the people that we met in the Bahamas, and then we went there and we had dinner with them. Really, that's, wow, alright. Should have been a shoe-in, but cool, okay. You gotta go. - Who's going? - I am so ready. - All right, you ready? - I'm ready, baby. - Go. - Okay, okay, Kermit's girlfriend. - Miss Piggy! - Miss Piggy! - Why didn't you just give me the clue? - I gave you the clue, there's no more obvious- - A couple in the Bahamas? I have no idea- - Where were you that time- - Oh, Kanye West! - Kanye West. - You don't remember them, nothing? - Pizza, and she has funny outfits and big blue eyes- - Lady Gaga. - Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga. - No, no, no- - Katie Perry? - Yes. - It's just a game. - Are you gonna be like this... [Ryann} Sexy... ...the whole night? Please do not be like this the whole night. Don't, I'm... - You what? - You don't have to tell. - No, I don't have to do anything. I'm just telling you, take care of yourself. Don't worry about me, okay? - , I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry about, that's really- - I'll be right back. - You don't have to fucking, don't start this. You can't even take a joke, are you kidding? Don't do this, come on. - Leave me alone. - Don't just run away from me. You can't even look at me right now, is that? Oh my, you are not gonna fucking do this. I don't care if everyone can hear it, all right? - You want to deal with this right now? - Yeah. - Well, I think you've made it crystal clear that you hate me. - I don't hate you, you're just embarrassing me in front of all of my friends. Get fun! Just be fun, please! - You resent me, Natalie, like I took something from you. I mean, did you see what you just did down there? You treated me like a child, this isn't working like this. - Oh Jesus. - Oh wow. - This isn't 100%, it's not. You're so critical of everything I do! You tell me I'm not drinking enough, I'm drinking too much, I'm not sitting in the right place. - No, it's not that, I just feel like you're a liar! You lied to me about what, you said you were gonna come here and be present and be in it, and all you do is sit in the bed and go off to work and be totally somewhere else! And I understand that your work is important, alright? I don't know how to get you to just be with me. - I'm here now, and I have to work because this week is a big week for me, you know that, and yet I continue to disappoint, I continue to frustrate you. You chose to acknowledge that this is fucked up. - It's a long time coming, it's, we shouldn't- - We might be able to do something about it. - What are you talking about, a long time coming? - Do you know something? - No, it's nothing, it's none of my business. - It's us, this is the problem, not me, not you. Spit it out! - I'm in a house full of people who see me, hear me, actually remember all of the moments because they matter. And I feel like you and I are just going through our lives and missing all of the moments. - Do you know how many times I've heard that story about you and the bacon hat? How many times I've heard about you and Salamanca in the summer? I'm your husband, so if you want exciting moments and happiness, you've gotta make it with me. And for the last five years, you've been nowhere. And I'm not saying that I've been a star student, or whatever, but you have checked out in terms of supporting me in this relationship. I'm giving all I can, and this is all I can. And yeah, it's not enough for you. - I just, I know your work is important. I know that all of the things we have in our lives are important, I just kind of want to be the most important thing. - You'll never be enough for me, Natalie. You understand? We're partners, you're not my everything. Do you get it? - Yeah. - Okay, well, I'm gonna pick up a little bit. - Do you want help? - Count the cards on our team, at least. See if we won. - We definitely won, I think we won. - I feel awful, should one of us go up there? - No. - No, absolutely not. - I'm single, I'm sorry, I don't know. - I'm really tired, Natalie, and... I don't know. - So what do we do? - I love you, Natalie. But I gotta go. - Just let me do it myself. - You're fine, geez. - Are you sure you can do this? - Geez, bossypants. - Hey, don't. I'm tired. - Did you know that a yawn is a sign of empathy? - I've never been called empathetic, empathotic? - Give me the- - Sure. - I'm so tired, just give me the shit. - Wow, look at you, don't drop anything. - You be careful- - Don't break anything. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good job. - That was a little loud there, I shouldn't clap and wake everybody up. I forgot everybody was sleeping. Tonight's been fun. - I know, it's been so awesome. - I know, it's been good. It's been really good to see everybody. - Oh, Natalie and Richard! - My gosh, I had no, I mean, I was blown away by what happened. I feel bad for her. - Yeah. - Yeah. It really makes me, it makes me miss my boring life. You know? It does. How you doing? - Really tired, but good. - You're tired? - Mm-hmm. - I know, me too, I miss Max and Lilly, though. - I just really- enjoyed some time away. - Yeah. - I mean, I- - That's good. - Yeah. I haven't been away since he was born. - You haven't, is this your first overnight away? - Yeah. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you sure? What's wrong? - I don't... I don't miss him. - You don't miss who? - I don't miss Braden. - What do you mean you don't miss him? I was... - All I wanted this whole weekend was just some time for myself, that's what I really want. - Okay, well, that's fine, but that doesn't mean that you don't miss Braden, that would be... You don't mean that? - Stop it. - Stop what? - Just stop asking me what's wrong, I'm fine. - Uh, you're not fine. - I'm fine. - What's wrong? - I just, wow, I don't know. But how do you do this here? How did you put this whole thing together and still do everything for Max and Lilly, and still have time for yourself? I mean, I don't understand. - You just do it. I do need time for myself, but I also know that my kids need me. - OK I don't understand where this is coming from. - Oh, so now this is a little martyr-ship thing that you're doing, is that what you're doing? So I confide in you and you turn it around and make me feel like shit? I almost forgot. - I am not trying to be a martyr. I am listening to what you're saying, and I'm not understanding it, so maybe you can help me understand what you're talking about. What exactly are you saying, I don't understand. - That I don't think I should have been a mom. That I am an artist, and that now I'm a mom, and I don't fucking want to be a mom. And maybe that's what you want to do. Actually, I think that's all that you ever wanted to do, and that's what you're doing now, and that's all you can do, so... - Wow. You know what? Too late for that, that's too late for that. What are you even talking about? It's too late. If you didn't want to be a mom, then you shouldn't have had a kid. - That's great. - You know what? That's fine if you don't think that I can do anything else, but I'm happy, and I love being a mom. And you need to figure your shit out. And I'm sorry that you feel that way, I really am. - Me too. - I'm gonna go to bed. - Good. - I am so disappointed in you, I really am. - I was just thinking in the bathroom. - Oh yeah? - And I have an idea. - Does it involve playing cards? - No. - Okay. - Okay, I'm gonna tell you the idea, and I don't want you to talk until I'm done with the idea. Good, alright, so. As we both know, I have had difficulties with the men for my entire life, and I was just thinking that it might make sense for me to try the ladies. - Ah, this was the idea that you came up with in the bathroom- - I'm not finished yet, so I think what should happen is that I think you should kiss me. - Okay. - Yeah? - Sure, why not, I'll be your guinea pig, go for it. - Okay, close your eyes, alright. Um... I'm gonna try one more. Mmm-hmm. Nope. No. - So you don't like the ladies? Or you don't like kissing me? - Oh, no, you're great, I just think. Oh, you're such a great friend. - How much did you have to drink? - Like a a bottle of wine and Natalie's shots. Oh, man, that's so weird. - Hey, Mer? Mmm-hmm? You gotta go easy on Ryann. She's new, she doesn't know us. And you and Jacob broke up eons ago. - Yeah, no. - Come on. I remember the Meredith before the business attire, before the cellphones and the meetings, and the pantsuits and whatever. Remember when you took care of me when I had that fever, it was like 104, Jesus. And you came in and checked on me every hour on the hour, you made it your sole purpose in life. Do you remember that? You're a good person. And you're enough, and you don't need Jacob anymore, or any man, for that matter, or a lady. - Oh, thanks, CJ. Oh. - You'll be fine, can you get that door, 'cause it's so bright right now. - I like it open. - Oh my God. - Oh, CJ, I'm not that kind of girl. - I know, we just discovered that. Bye. - I'm leaving. Can you make sure she makes her plane? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Not now. - Hey, what's up, man? - What's up, James, still going for those morning runs, huh? Amazing. - What's this? - Something came up, I gotta get out of here. - Now? - Yeah, a bit of a surprise, but- - You're gonna miss the event for Harris. - Yeah, would you give him a hug for me, tell him I said hey? - Did you say goodbye to everybody? - No, everyone's still asleep. I didn't want to bug anybody, so you know, give my best to them. But it was good to see you. - Good to see you too, man. - It's been too long. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Let's hope that next time is sooner rather than later. - Yeah, right? I'll see you around. All right. You can't build a life on a couple of pictures. - Try me, get out there. Go see the world, I mean, the auto shop will always be there. It's a wild life. But it's very rewarding, too. - Yeah, I don't know if I'm built for it. - There's only one way to find out. Just make sure you send me some pictures. - I'll think about it. - Deal. - Deal. - Look, if had to happen, at least it happened among friends. - Yes, it doesn't really- - Good morning. - Good morning, guys. - Good morning. - Oh, did you guys make coffee? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you much. - God. - How did you guys sleep? - Well, in spite of Meredith's arm being draped across my head when I woke up, I slept like a baby. - Babies don't sleep, actually. - True. - I wouldn't know, but I've heard. - How you doing, Nat? - Oh, you know, not my best moment, but I'm okay. - Morning, ladies. - Good morning, James. - You guys should actually try getting up early around here. - Yeah, I think I will pass on that. I choose sleep over beautiful vistas any day of the week. - You would say that, but if you'd gotten up this morning, in addition to the sunrise, you'd have gotten a chance to say goodbye to Joseph. - What do you mean goodbye to Joseph? What, did he go get groceries or something? - No, he bounced, told me to tell you guys goodbye. - Huh, yeah, of course he did, of course. Why did we expect any more from him, right? - Well, he's true to himself, that's what he does. - Wow. Hey oh. - Some ruckus going on down here. - Somebody got laid last night. - Maybe. - Maybe? Maybe a little bit. - What's up, man? - What's up? - Joseph left. Right? - That's, God. He's my hero, come on, international man of awesome, just picks up and flies whenever he wants to. Hanging with the Sadhus and dancing with some Shaman priests, and... that's so cool, though, that's awesome. - Listen. Ummm...I... You know how I have a lot of sick days that I haven't used? I'm gonna need a...month leave of absence, actually. No. Sammy can do all of the things that I do. He can. I booked a ticket already, I am off to Peru, actually, to see Machu Picchu. - Okay, you guys, let's go, let's go, let's go. We've got 30 minutes before the thing. - We're coming! - Come on, babe, we're running late. - Oh, I forgot my toothbrush. Go in the car, I'll meet you there. I'm ready, Becky, I even have heels on! I'll be outside! - Hey. - You need a ride? - Yes. - Oh, Meredith, your suitcase is already in the car. - Thank you, I'll be right there. - Okay, Becks, I'm in the car! - Listen, I just want to say, welcome to the group, Ryann. - Thank you. Do you need help? - No, I'm good, I'm going! - Surprise!!! - Oh, you... You...I...mmmm. - Natty Bacon is very resourceful. - Oh, the honors, please? - Make a wish! - That's very sweet of you. - Enjoy, it's just a little something. - Did you make these? - You bet your ass she did! - I've been leading this program for many years, and this year's group is truly exceptional. So here's to all of you. Come on, come on. - Yes. - Each of you, each and every one of you, of us, deserves 100% of what we want our lives to be 'cause there's one thing we know for certain. We only get one life. So make the most of it, cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, have you learned nothing? Eye contact, 'cause if you don't, it's- - Seven years bad sex. - And James could use all the help he can get. - Ohhhhhh! Seriously, though, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, yeah, yeah, yeah, good. - 100%!!! - Too much. ♪ I guess I just loved you too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just wanted it ♪ ♪ Too much ♪ ♪ Before we go ♪ ♪ Our separate ways ♪ ♪ I just thought you should know ♪ ♪ That I ♪ ♪ Did try ♪ ♪ No stone ♪ ♪ Left unturned ♪ ♪ But I guess I just loved you too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just wanted it ♪ ♪ Too much ♪ ♪ All ♪ ♪ That time ♪ ♪ You knew ♪ ♪ Didn't say a thing ♪ ♪ But I ♪ ♪ Still thought ♪ ♪ We had ♪ ♪ One last chance ♪ ♪ But I guess I loved you too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just wanted it too much ♪ ♪ It doesn't really matter how we ended up ♪ ♪ This way ♪ ♪ It just didn't work out ♪ ♪ The love didn't stay the same ♪ ♪ 'Cause we ran out the clock ♪ ♪ So now it's time to go ♪ ♪ But I just thought I would let you know ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ 'Cause I loved you too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just wanted it too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just loved you too much ♪ ♪ I guess I just wanted it too much ♪
