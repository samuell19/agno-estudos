NETFLIX PRESENTS To be the best dolphin trainer, you have to be an obsessive person. Competitive. You have to have a bigger ego than ordinary people. José Luis has always liked to win. Stand out. Be the best at everything. But, watch out. There's a lot of jealousy in this job. You never know who might stab you in the back. It would be extremely unfair for anyone to draw conclusions about who José Luis Barbero was by watching a video. That fateful 99-second video. The worst seconds of a trainer's life. A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY The dolphin. VOICE OF JOSÉ LUIS BARBERO A creature revered by our ancestors. In our times, these beings are victims of man's unscrupulousness and ambition. Despite this, the dolphin continues to show its trust and closeness to man. I have learned many things from dolphins. That they know us much better than we know them. My job? I work with dolphins. José Luis had a special relationship with the animals. He was the one who motivated them. The animals would wait at the door until he arrived. When you saw that, you wondered, "Why won't the dolphins follow me?" BARBERO'S ASSISTANT TRAINER I learned almost everything with José Luis. Who was José Luis? The best in the world. And I was his assistant. It's one of the most beautiful jobs in the world. Sometimes it's better to work with animals than people. What happened is a great example of this. They aren't evil. They don't have bad intentions. Every training session is a therapy session between dolphin and trainer. It's very similar to a teacher with a student in school. You know each one's characteristics and how to bring out the best in them. This is exactly the same. For José Luis, the key is to use a coherent language that is constant and flawless. A common language. The animals had no doubts about what José Luis expected from them. Now! Now! That's a wrap. Come on, baldy. José Luis has been working with dolphins for approximately 30 years. Yes, I started in Majorca in a dolphinarium called Marine land. That's where it all began. VIDEOS Then I opened a dolphinarium in Madrid. I opened a dolphinarium in Costa Brava, in Barcelona. There were a few of them. Hello! My girl is so beautiful! Stop messing around, man. Now I'm helping to open a dolphinarium in Atlanta, United States. FORMER CEO OF GEORGIA AQUARIUM Georgia Aquarium makes José Luis an offer he can't refuse. When he told me he was going to the Georgia Aquarium, that he was offered a position as vice president, it was unbelievable. For me and for us as colleagues, we took pride in saying, "Look how far José Luis has come." José Luis was already in his late fifties. He was almost 60. It was the culmination of his career. And José Luis was over the moon. But, watch out. Watch out, because... you never know what might happen. He insulted and kicked the dolphins... Parc Marine land Majorca... The trainer in question is... Carla, take three. It was our responsibility to publish images of what was happening. Because, also, the public just isn't aware, right? Of what goes on behind the scenes of the show they're watching... behind the music, fun and... and the dolphins are smiling. The fact that the dolphins were trained in such an aggressive, violent way, shocked and hurt me a lot. José Luis Barbero was responsible. Those events were taking place under his watch. It had a big impact in the United States. And that's when you realize this could have serious consequences. When the videos came out here, José Luis was in Georgia. WIFE He calls me and says, "They ruined my life." KILLER TRAINERS I HOPE SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENS TO YOU HIS MOM GAVE BIRTH TO A BASTARD! I had never seen people get as angry as they did with José Luis without knowing him at all. YOU DESERVE TO BE SHOT IN THE FUCKING HEAD It was a crusade against José Luis Barbero. Everyone had something to say. Everyone criticized him blindly. It's carnage. What they have done to me is unforgivable. In my 35-year career, I have never abused an animal. Not in Marine land and, as far as I know, not in any dolphinarium in the world today are dolphins abused as the anti-dolphinarium organizations make it seem. It was pure fury. It was hatred and rage against him that I have rarely seen since, and we see a lot on Twitter. He must have felt embarrassed, humiliated, frustrated... He had to feel a lot of things that are difficult to manage. I could tell he was really down. And I told him, "Pack your bags and come to Spain." When José Luis arrived home, he played the videos frame by frame. You're lazy! He saw that things didn't match up at all. The fucking ball! Hey! Lazy! It's a few seconds of really ugly clips, one after another, and the result is a very violent video. This was not the norm for José Luis Barbero. I said, "We have to get a lawyer and see what they say." That's when we hired Mateo. Like any other client who enters my office, I told him that the first thing I do is investigate to see if what he's telling me is true. And if it's true, then I move on and defend him. The conclusion we reached was that those videos were indeed tampered with. We have expert reports proving the video was edited. According to the technicians, it's a botched job. Even I am not 100% sure that I'm the person seen there, but... He looked strong to me. If you didn't do it, you don't have to stop working. And that's what he did. We had our suspicions. The editing was weird. Georgia Aquarium started an investigation and sent several people here to Majorca to interview all the members of the team one by one. The interview had law enforcement nuances. They asked us to interpret what we saw in that video. I was not completely sincere in that situation. Obviously, José Luis was my friend and... And I downplayed the gravity of many of the situations seen. We received a call from some people hired by the Georgia Aquarium. They said they had been in Majorca and that they'd done an exhaustive investigation because they intended to hire José Luis Barbero and they had to know if it was real. Initially, the conversation had a somewhat intimidating or threatening tone to it. They came with an expert report saying "This does not correspond to that." "This is not real, this has been tampered with..." INVESTIGATOR MEETING CAMERA - 200 M - PENGUINS - TRAINERS CAMERA - 200 M - TRAINERS How do you say it? I have to ask, did you manipulate the video? The video was not manipulated at any time, it was simply edited. Around November 2014, approximately, we received a package with several hours of footage saying that they had witnessed violent and aggressive behavior towards the animals in Marine land Majorca. What we did was edit those images into a short video. And what we told them is that we agreed to maintain the anonymity of the source at all times. THE PEOPLE WHO RECORDED THE VIDEO HAVE REMAINED ANONYMOUS FOR SEVEN YEARS THEY HAVE DECIDED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTIVIST ACTIVIST This story began one night when I was introduced to a super nice person. We talked about activism. I always end up talking about activism. And the topic of animal abuse at Marine land came up. So, I talked to friends and we thought about how we could find out if such abuse really existed. The only way we could do it was by getting a camera and recording it. And so I asked for help. I was a minor when I started doing animal activism. I think it was already common knowledge that things were happening in Marine land. We were told that we could gain access to a neighbor's house with a good view to install a camera and record videos. We weren't even sure if it was going to work. We had never set up a video surveillance system. I had to borrow money to buy the cheapest device on the market and someone lent us a camcorder. I guess it's recorded everything. I think it shows it's recorded. I don't know, at the store they told me it's a strange model. We just have to make sure it's recording every day. When we were setting up the system, we wanted to protect it from the rain. So we put cardboard over it. Then we just had to wait. Once we had all the material, we contacted various associations to help us spread the word. It was SOS Delfines that took the material and made the first edition, which was not professional at all. Once he got back from the United States, from Georgia, José Luis stayed at home, we would go out for walks... He kept going to Marine land to see how things were going, to see if they needed help. And he told me, "Tomorrow morning I have to get up a little bit early because I'm going to go get the vet." "Don't make me breakfast." CIVIL GUARD When they started looking for José Luis because he didn't show up, they sent helicopters and didn't stop looking for him. They didn't stop. And it was a bit distressing. When the video went viral, it was like a collective psychosis and, suddenly, we were the worst thing in the world. I received threats through WhatsApp messages. They said they knew what I was doing. I changed my life. I changed my profession. I really buried that. José Luis had been a friend, a boss, a partner... And it came as a shock. Talking about José Luis Barbero and what happened involves opening a lot of boxes. It means addressing the issue of captivity, of the power of social media. It's talking about what the old school used to do, which was harsher. It's talking about what elite training is like, and I say "elite" because José Luis was looking for perfection. You can't judge everything that happened only from... from... a 90-second video. The irony of all this is that José Luis fought hard for the welfare of dolphins. So, for him to later... be treated as an abuser... I can't understand it. MAJORCA I fell in love with Majorca from the first second. The sea, the people. There was freedom. One night, we went to the club and then José Luis showed up. That's where it all began. He was nice, he was very... cocky. On the coast of Blanes, in Marine land, the shows run continuously. Visitors hardly have time to take in all the surprises. Marine land was established in 1970. It was a very innovative thing, the first dolphinarium in Spain. It was the most profitable park per square meter in the world. Famous people would visit the park. For example, the royal family, the Dalai Lama, Diana of Wales... When I arrived at Marine land, I took a job washing dishes. They asked, "Do you know anyone who wants to come and work at the restaurant as a waiter?" I said, "I'll ask José Luis." And that's how it all started. José Luis was very intelligent, very polite, very efficient. He learned from others. When he finished his shift, instead of rushing off, he would stand at the gate looking at the dolphins. And one day I asked him a casual question, "Do you like dolphins?" He surprised me when he said, "Yes, I'd love to be a dolphin trainer." I told him, "Look, to get there, you have to work your way up from the bottom." I said, "You make more in four hours working as a waiter than what you'll make washing buckets." He said, "Do you have enough food?" I said, "I do." Back then, all trainers were foreigners because dolphinariums had existed in their countries for years. But not here. They didn't want Spaniards. It was a static show on the edge of the pool. They only did a few tricks in the water. And that's when José Luis got in the pool. José Luis began to clean the buckets, to prepare the fish, to smell of fish. He said, "I just wash buckets, but I pay attention to everything." Then they gave him a sea lion to train. He was happy, he worked long hours. He started to get in the water a bit and do water tricks, which was what he liked the most. When Kees arrived, he helped him a lot and that's how he got the hang of it. FORMER HEAD TRAINER OF MARINELAND FORMER HEAD TRAINER AT MARINELAND Be careful, Markus. Markus, please! Me? And now we have something very special. Here comes José Luis. Bravo! A round of applause. The job of a dolphin trainer is like that of an elite athlete. It's physically demanding. And José Luis was a real perfectionist in this regard. He asked to do the tricks that were the most physically demanding for the trainer. José Luis became the pool sheriff. A final round of applause for the dolphins and their trainers. IMATA was an international association of all the trainers in the world. But it really wasn't. It was only for Americans. The Americans were the ones who invented dolphin shows. They were what everyone aspired to be. For European trainers, going to the IMATA annual conference was like... being invited to the Oscars. And you were a bit of the ugly duckling. At each conference they give awards. If you won an IMATA award, especially for best show, it was very important. And José Luis got it into his head that he had to win. We went on trips to conferences. To parks. "Let's visit all the Sea Worlds." We'd go anywhere to watch shows and see how their quality compared to ours. JOSÉ LUIS BARBERO'S CAMERA Come on, what a lousy way to train dolphins. Look at his eyes, he's blind, man. Why does the bottom look...? It's deliberate. To show depth. It's a trick. Wow, this is pretty cool, I have ocean, I have... What a mess. Once he knew how they worked and how he worked, he decided to put together a show and present it. He went there to present the show and they laughed at him before they watched the video. To them, we were rednecks. "Who are these people?" When they watched the video, they were impressed. They were amazed. "What is this?" Our show had 42 tricks in 30 minutes. We had gone to their parks and the one with the most had 12 tricks in 45 minutes. We beat them to a pulp. And he came back with the award for best dolphin show and the trophy for the world's best trainer that year. This is the first international award won in Europe and here in Majorca. We did it. It's with great satisfaction that we'll continue working and achieving success with these animals. This is a great way to make people aware that we should preserve them in their natural habitat. The Civil Guard continues searching for the 59-year-old man who went missing in the El Toro area, in Calvià, on Tuesday morning. The man is José Luis Barbero, the Marine land trainer who appears in a video where he allegedly abused dolphins. The Civil Guard has yet to find any trace of the missing man. I kept hoping that José Luis had rented a hotel room and had gone to meditate, to isolate himself. And to try to relax and deal with the psychological pressure he was under at that moment. I realized that I had to keep calm. But I remembered the video and I wanted to know where it came from. What I see in this image... It was recorded from the building next to Marine land, obviously. And the image... it's bad quality, you can see stripes. The images are from a cell phone filming a security camera monitor. You can see things that are different. The floor has been painted blue, the sea lion chairs have been changed... And we know when those changes occurred. Therefore, we know the videos were shot over the course of a couple of years, at least. If you are so concerned about the animals, why do you wait to show the videos? Why don't you show them the next day? To stop it. I don't get it. Lazy! You must understand they chose the right moment to publish it, when José Luis had signed the contract with Georgia Aquarium, and José Luis was already in the United States. They calculated how to cause the greatest possible harm to José Luis Barbero. I have the impression that part of the team may have been collecting recordings from the security cameras. The same person or people continued to make those recordings from the building next to Marine land. What I see there is hatred and revenge. With José Luis, the tricks we practiced required a lot of physical preparation. Otherwise, you couldn't keep up with the show. He demanded it of himself and others. What happened? People didn't like that. And now, ladies and gentlemen, something very difficult... There was this trick we all dreaded. When José Luis said, ": Let's work on double skiing." We were scared stiff. You had to focus. When you saw the dolphins' shadow, you had to pray. Pray that you wouldn't slip. Come on! Go fuck yourself, you brat! Come on, for fuck's sake! He'd say, "You're useless. Get out of the water." He'd grab me by the hair. But we'd laugh about it later and that's it. I always asked him, "Isn't it a bit much?" He'd always answer, "Ask them if it's too much or not." If you can do it right the first time, why should an animal have to do it again because you weren't focused or didn't do it right? That's what really bothered José Luis. When my father was training, he was tough. He couldn't find the right people or they didn't last long. So he was always short-staffed. I decided to talk to him and said, "I'll give you a hand." "If I'm good, fine, and if I'm not, I'll quit." I worked with him for three years. My father was tough on all his staff, but with my brother... SON Four times worse. You had to pay attention. If you didn't, he would tell you off. That's normal. I remember he'd have the microphone on and you could hear him all over the park, not just in the dolphinarium. You'd hear him telling him off and calling him names. More to the left. Marcos! You're way ahead, damn it! You never learn! You're stubborn! He treated me the same as everyone else. Fuck, Marcos, if this is what you're going to do every time you come, we're in trouble. I got very involved. I learned from my father, but realized that I'd never manage to do what he's done because, to me, he's one of the best, and I couldn't do it. Let's see, I was... I was always bragging about it, that my father worked with dolphins and so on and... I wanted to do it when I grew up. DO YOUNGSTERS UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BY TALKING? He is the son of the general supervisor of marine animal trainers in Spain. This is Jordi Barbero, he's six years old and is from Majorca. Jordi, tell us. This... - This one... - Is this you? Or is this you? Which one are you? Why did you swim with them? Because my dad let me do it. You're lucky. There aren't many kids who've played with dolphins. Hey, tell me one last thing. What would you say to people who abuse animals? They shouldn't misbehave or else they will be taken to the police. To the police, yes sir. CIVIL GUARD They didn't know where José Luis was. It was a painful time, to tell you the truth. The first thing I thought was, "Keep an eye on José Luis." Because he is a person who's strong on the outside, very confident in his work. But emotionally weak. And insecure. The story of what he had endured when he was fired from Marine land comes to mind. The Monetary Committee agreed this afternoon in Brussels that the peseta should be devalued by 8%. It is vital at this time of crisis to adjust labor costs. The 1990s were times of tremendous economic ups and downs. A huge economic crisis hit Spain. They called me one day and said, "Look, we're going to sell." They wanted to get rid of Marine land Majorca. They told me, "Why don't you get your whole team together and create a cooperative and buy the park?" And the idea then was that a group of people, including José Luis, of course, would become shareholders. It was the best thing that could happen to us. We were going to "own" the park in some way. We all had a small piece of it. But the owners of the land, the Blanes, were not informed of that. When I went to negotiate the renewal of the lease, the Blanes told me, "No, we've already given it to As pro." "To whom?" "To As pro." As pro is a limited liability company made up of four or five partners. As pro started with two parks and now has fifty-something. INDUSTRY: THEME PARK OPERATOR, AQUARIUMS, ZOOS They bought Marine land like they could have bought a pizza factory. It was a money-making machine, it was good business, but the concept they had of Marine land was different from the one we had. When As pro bought Marine land, everything changed. It changed absolutely everything. Even the people changed. 20TH ANNIVERSARY The company started to make cutbacks, fire people at the end of the year, everybody out. Especially those who'd been there the longest. I know I had a talk with José Luis advising him not to be cocky, that he was dealing with bad people. And that... it wasn't like before. It wasn't like before. José Luis had a strong personality and always said, "I won't do this." "I won't do that." Of course, companies don't tolerate that well. And they fired him. He couldn't enter the park. I thought that was too much. He'd call me on the phone and I'd open the beach door entrance so that, at 7:00 p.m., he could come to see the dolphins. And more than once... More than once I saw him crying... because he couldn't be with the dolphins, He considered them his, not the company's. "They've taken my dolphins." As a result of this, we found out José Luis had tried to commit suicide. I didn't understand it. I've never been able to understand it. I thought he was fine. But he wasn't. He was very good at... hiding it. When he started talking to me and telling me about his life, it changed some of the perceptions I had of him as a cocky guy. He warned me, "When you visit Los Pizarrales, don't be scared." Because it is a very humble neighborhood in Salamanca. Not so much now, but it used to be. Things were different back then. We had a different way of making a living. We spent a lot of time on the street. José Luis had a sixth sense with dogs. He trained them. They obeyed him. He told me that he didn't have a mother. That he was 18 months old when she died. And I said, "What about your father?" He said, "My father married another woman right away." He said, "But I was raised by my grandfather and my aunt and they are my family." He used to call me "mom" and I'd say, I am not your mother, I am your aunt. When he was 10 or 11 years old, he lost his grandmother and his father wanted to take him away. And he didn't want to go. He never told us how bad he'd had it at that time. One day, I was coming home from work and someone asked me, "What happened to José?" "He left his bike but he's gone." "What do you mean, he's gone?" He got on the train. The first place the freight train stopped was where he got off. He didn't feel comfortable and said, "Well, look, I'll get on the train and leave." He disappeared for a week. I can perfectly understand José Luis. He sees how his passion, his life, is falling apart. The daily work with animals is therapeutic in itself. The admiration people project on you, the applause you receive. When you lose all that, you have to be very mentally trained to avoid suffering negative consequences. I felt that he cared more about the animals than... He had always cared about them, but it was more than I thought. José Luis had disappeared and his Facebook wall was full of accusations. MAYBE A DOLPHIN ATE HIM. MAYBE HE WENT TO GEORGIA AND DIDN'T TELL ANYONE? I HOPE HE SHOWS UP SOON SO THAT HE CAN GO TO JAIL. I don't think anyone can imagine the pressure until you experience it. The problem with that video is that it was personal. Because the person who made it, who planned it, had something against José Luis Barbero as a person. The issue isn't José Luis or this trainer or the other one. The issue is if you're for or against captivity. Let's sit down, let's talk. All right, come on, get up. Let's go. José Luis reaches a point where he says, "Fuck it, let's go." And that's it. - Hold it. - Watch out for its fin. Careful with its tail. He managed to go back to working with dolphins again. His joy in life was renewed. Good, pull this way. - This way. - Cross... Alfonso! Did you hurt yourself? He hurt himself. Wait. José Luis contacts me and tells me about the project he is involved in. Okay. There were two dolphinariums, one in Alicante and another in Tenerife. No. - Are you okay or not? - Yes. Holy shit! Fuck. Let's wait. Getting dolphins is very difficult. Okay, out then. Let's turn it over and draw blood! It won't take it. As all dolphinariums in the UK had been closed, so there were some dolphins on the market that could be used and rented. It's against my chest. José Luis finds out about this and rents them. - I bet you can't. - A bit, man. - Okay, perfect. - Careful! Careful, damn it! Fucking... - Careful back there! - Careful, damn it! Resources? They were scarce. And José Luis paid out of his own pocket the minimum that would be needed to take care of the animals. Even when things were going badly, I remember that José Luis used his own money to pay the salaries of the trainers who were there. Apply a bit of alcohol here. That's it. Let's turn it. We can turn it. After a few months, financial difficulties crept in and we decided to take the three dolphins in Alicante to the park in Tenerife. We knew that the financial situation was better there and we wouldn't have problems. Mass tourism is the driving force behind dolphin shows in Spain. There are four dolphinariums in the Canary Islands alone. For me, it is the Guantánamo of cetaceans worldwide. For an animal that needs to travel long distances, how can you put it in a pool, however big it may be? When José Luis set up the Tenerife dolphinarium, he already had it well planned out, he had designed it... He had measured the blueprints many times. The dolphinarium designed by José Luis at that time was the most modern dolphinarium in Spain, with better facilities, more water capacity, especially in terms of animal welfare and their handling when providing veterinary care. He knew how many animals he was going to have. He wanted to develop a breeding program. HAVANA Cuba was one of the few countries that traded dolphins at that time. The country had been in what was called a "special period" for a few years, which was when the USSR ceased to support Cuba financially. Cuba? What a disaster. The dolphinarium was... If the good ones here were bad, imagine how they were in Cuba. It was awful. I realized that, for us to have those dolphins, we had to get in line, because there were more people interested, there were more companies interested in buying dolphins. So you were put on the waiting list. And I got a wake-up call. The reality of seeing animals that had been recently captured, and you become... an accomplice. It's dirty, they've been there for days. Come on, boss. Which one is it? Move aside. Come on. Close there, close. No. Close it! - Careful with its fin. - Its head. Careful with its tail! - Its tail! - There! - Hold its head. - Okay. Celia, now! - What time is it? - 9:20 p.m. Come on, let's move it forward. - Now. - Roll, now. Lift its head! No, leave its tail alone! Wait a minute. Celia, tell me when you're ready. Take the stick out. - What stick? - That one! That's not a stick. That plane was scary. I remember the constant noise. Annoying. If it was annoying for us, it was probably annoying for the animals. And the truth is, they behaved quite well given the circumstances. For them, going through that experience had to be like if we were abducted by a UFO. Something like that. IMATA CONFERENCE 1996 We had three animals that came from Alicante and six dolphins were bought in Cuba. The group dynamics were so good that after a few months we realized that four females were pregnant. Go get yourself laid, motherfucker. You can see him in full swing now. The guy is super turned on. He's hornier than a toad. He's had quite the month... Wow! He doesn't care if it's a male or female, when he sees a hole, he sticks it in. - Really? - Yeah, really. In captivity there are births, but there's also a very high mortality rate. And the fact that four out of four babies survived was a worldwide milestone. Not all dolphinaria could produce offspring. It was a success for the company, for the park and for everyone. The company could profit from countless opportunities. When the dolphins are grown and trained, you can take them to other parks. You don't have to capture more dolphins. You don't have to buy another animal, because they were expensive. Come on, sweetie. Yeah, you can do it. Look! Come on! It's mostly out, right? Yes, come on. That's it! Done. A female, it's a female! Look at her, let's go. - That's it! - Let's go! Come on! That's it, great! Let's go up! Good! She has a girl's face. Our family has grown. With her arrival, 12 dolphins have been born as part of the Aqualand Costa Adeje aquatic mammal breeding program in the last 13 years, placing the company among the elite of European dolphinaria. Few dolphinaria in the world achieved a 100% success rate. The dolphins are born and after two or three months or weeks they don't make it because of social, environmental problems, as I said before. On Tuesday, Barbero left his house in El Toro to attend a meeting to which he never arrived. The search for him started after that. You think he might still be alive. I called his phone several times and told him to stop whatever he was doing and come home, that we're on his side. Until the signal disappeared because his phone was dead. We were also very afraid because of the social media issue. Because my father had received death threats, both him and our family. So, not hearing from him for so long, the anguish only grew stronger. I did think... that he might be in the sea. Because if he didn't show up... the only place he liked was the sea. José Luis went to work for a company that had no idea about dolphins and made the water park the best dolphinarium in Spain. And I went to see it and it was fantastic. It made me very happy. Higher jumps, animals that swam faster... It was spectacular. ...the farewell of our trainer, José Luis. Evidently, As pro found out. Put your hands away! Adán, put your hands away, not you! Get on the edge. Put your hand away! When José Luis learned that As pro was back in his life again, he was nervous. He was very nervous. As pro Ocio did it on the sly. The owner of the park made the big mistake of selling a 51% share. So he lost control of his company. He sold it cheap. It was as if they'd stolen the park. Business stuff. Then José came home one day and said, "Mari, guess who he sold it to?" When he said that, I said, "That's it, As pro." I said, "Okay, pack your bags and come home." Stop right there! Move back! Move back! Training sessions... Fuck you, man! ...were very tense. Can you move further away from the animals? Will you move further away? Holy shit. It's just unbelievable, man. Yes, hello. Feed that animal. Don't get out until this one's out! - I thought he was out already! - Fuck! You don't start until he comes here. Don't you fucking ever learn? Fuck. God! What a fucking idiot! What a shitty show, dammit! So, when As pro arrived, we were expecting them to fire him, yes. And... They didn't say anything to him. He kept on working, the days went by and so on. I said, "José Luis, this is weird." They spoke to him and said they had no intention of firing him. The dolphinarium was a gold mine. Firing José Luis would be like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Sure, you could hire another professional. But, who would you hire? An untrained dolphin can cost you 200,000 euros. A trained one can cost you a million euros, so... José Luis made the company a lot of money. He made the company millions. Óscar. - It looks like he threw up. - He got scared, right? They're throwing balls, towels and all that shit... Cover! God! Let's see, move it a little bit. - Inside? - Yes, inside and now outside. - Outside. - Outside? Don't open that much, Pe. - I don't want him to bite my hand. - Don't worry. Here it is, look at it. Here. When he breathes, he fucks everything up. Go up. Record it! Fucking camera! The fucking ball's here, thank God we found it. There's the ball. It's down there. Now we... Now we need to introduce a lot of water. Yeah. Careful now. Do you want me to choke him again? Come on... There it is. Can you introduce the tube? Come on! It's the other way. You have to bend it that way... - Okay. - ...so the animal will turn around. - Okay. - This is slippery! It's very slippery. Come on, there you go. Pull and see... Come on, man. Come on. That's it, now. Try again, Tania. I think that's enough. Careful. Got it? - Yeah! - Yeah! Great! Come on, go! Water! - Where is he? - He went to open up. - Where's the ball? - In there. - So I can record it. - Go check the water. I don't know why this shit is taking so long. Take a look at it. I want to see if it's intact, that there are no missing pieces. That hole is huge. I LOVE FREE DOLPHINS I remember back then there was some animal rights pressure, but not at the level we have today. And José Luis, who was a very intelligent guy, set up a therapy program. We're here with José Luis, the promoter of dolphin therapy in Spain. How long have you been working on this therapy and what kind of children it is designed for? We have been working since 1993 and it consists of helping kids with issues by interacting and playing with dolphins. In an altruistic way... He didn't mind getting himself into some spectacular messes. At first, when we got into dolphin therapy, I thought, "But we have no idea what we're going to do." We want to develop children's motivation so they can develop concepts that might otherwise take months to develop in a facility. And, thanks to this exciting new environment the children experience, they develop spontaneously. Do you want to go see the seals and/or the dolphins? It was very shocking to see José Luis, who was always so demanding with both the dolphins and the trainers, and then the way he behaved with children in the water, how he managed things, how gently he treated them, how patiently... Dolphin therapy has already been experienced by more than 2,500 attendees with different diagnoses. I think keeping these animals in captivity deserves much more respect. We don't simply do circus tricks, but we also work on important things. We did the therapy sessions during our breaks. And, in that sense, he spent more time doing this therapy than anyone else. He made it clear to the company from the very beginning, "I do this because I want to." "I won't allow you to charge anyone who wants to come here." It's dangerous to give false hopes with these projects. It's no panacea and we must not confuse people. The parents of these children suffer from tremendous anxiety. They're eager to find solutions. We must be realistic. The dolphin is simply a facilitator, a bolster, to regular therapy the children receive. It is a means, not a remedy. I think that José Luis saw the therapy as a way to protect himself from the criticism of animal associations. But later I think he realized that he was doing something really very big and very positive for many families. The results that José Luis had in Tenerife were great. Without a doubt, it was the company's best dolphinarium. But the situation in Majorca was different. MAJORCA STOP KILLING DOLPHINS As pro was not happy with the results of the Majorca dolphinarium. Not just the show but in terms of other types of parallel income. When I joined Marine land Majorca, we wanted everything to be more educational. A calmer show where animals weren't seen interacting with objects, safeguarding the animals' well being. We tried not to have so many people in a pool with dolphins. Fewer photos. And, there were always fights with management because that was very profitable. You hold out your hand, a dolphin touches you and it's immediate cash, money. For a dolphin, it's so boring. Obviously, if the company has other dolphinaria where this activity is an important source of income, they want to do the same thing in Majorca. So they called José Luis to fix it. He was forced to return. If he refused, he'd be fired. He had been living in Tenerife for 20-odd years and he had his life there, his house, his family. Hey, let me film her! To be honest, the fact that As pro asked him and forced him to move to Majorca... I love dolphins. They totally screwed him over. What I have in my hands is a report that José Luis wrote... to As pro when he was sent to Majorca. So you can understand a little more about what happened. And what José Luis was like. He said, "After analyzing the general aspects of the two dolphinaria, we're going to face big problems in Tenerife if we try to bring the same kind or quality show to Majorca, which is out of line with the current times at Marine land." A show like the one we did 25 years ago in Majorca will probably increase the interest of a certain type of customer. But we have to consider the consequences and problems this will cause. I can create a circus-type show, like the one we did 25 years ago, as long as certain things and practices are changed in that dolphinarium. "But the question is: Is that what Marine land needs?" "I don't think so." The truth is, he didn't want to come. He wouldn't have come, even if he'd be fired. And that's where I messed things up. I told him, "Our friends are there and you're not far from retirement..." And so on. "Let's not create any problems. You've been through enough." And he agreed. When they told us that José Luis Barbero was coming, we all kind of braced ourselves, right? His fame preceded him. We knew he was a very demanding person and they hired him to come and put everything in order there, right? Training was tough and there was a lot of tension in the air. He yelled a lot. Come on, close, damn it! We repeated things multiple times. - Why? - Is he going to repeat it? He brings back the hoops, the referee whistle. He starts using objects... For us, it was like, "Wow, wait, we're kind of going backward." "We're going back to the old school." The Marine land show in Majorca has always been special. It was an award-winning show, not only here in Spain but also in the US. That's what we want to achieve again. José Luis' results were already noticeable when the park reopened for the new season four months later. And that's when we decided to talk to management and say that we weren't comfortable as a team, that we were getting into a routine that wasn't what we wanted. A lot of the people working there didn't like José Luis. I know how José Luis could be. He was blunt. And, well... Some people accepted him and some didn't. There was this girl. Her dream was to become a dolphin trainer. She would suffocate during training, she almost fainted. José Luis told her, "Train, go to the gym." And she didn't... Well, she wasn't all that into sports. She didn't feel like it or I don't know. She didn't want to train. For the attention of Marine land Majorca management. I want to put the following facts in writing. For fuck's sake! Damn it! I've never seen anyone treat team members and dolphins in such a humiliating and uncivilized way as José Luis Barbero does. See how we aren't being clear? Fuck! He's humiliated me with phrases like, "Go to a fucking gym!" "You're lazy! Dumb! Useless!" Stand on the edge! Put your hand away! He hit and kicked the dolphins. Fuck you! Let them fall, you'll see how they won't let themselves fall again. FOR THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT This employee wrote what was happening in a letter. It was hand-delivered with acknowledgment of receipt. The manager signed it. That means the manager knew about it and instead of trying to change these practices, he fired her. ...one of his dolphin shows for visitors. We are with the director of the zoo. Hello, Rafa. You have changed a lot and the dolphin show has also changed, which is spectacular. Yes, that's true. José Luis is the technical director of the dolphinarium and he's improved everything. Not only the show, but also the living environment of these animals, which will give us a quality boost here on the island, and in our dolphinarium. We were in the locker room. This girl who had talked to management had been fired just that day and she said that this wasn't the end and that... She wanted to put an end to José Luis Barbero. I don't think anyone really knows what happened. This person I met and who warned us about this abuse was a Marine land employee. - Ex-employee: It's him, right? - Woman: Sure. Ex-employee: That man disgusts me. Let's see. Do something. That had to hurt. Woman: It makes me laugh, okay? Ex-employee: He's fat but I think he doesn't know it. FEBRUARY 4TH, 2015 Hey! A trainer has allegedly abused dolphins. This person has been training dolphins for 35 years. SOS Delfines posted the undercover video, which it claims shows trainer José Luis Barbero of... Our objective was not reflected in the SOS Delfines publication. The captivity problem was personalized in José Luis Barbero. And it focused exclusively on him. I was shocked when he jumped and kicked a dolphin in the ribs. But it wasn't him, I think it was a woman. When we refer to the industry, we mean a collective of professionals. We never target an individual, on a personal level or any other level. Was José Luis Barbero like that? It was a part of him. He gave 100% or 120% and he wanted all of us to give that 120%, even the animals. Can you ask that of an animal that hasn't chosen to be there? Or maybe we should think differently. I wish this video could be used to end captivity. But that video was created to destroy him. This must have been a revenge plot, by some ex-employees of Marine land. SOS and FAADA have made a terrible mistake because they've been used for a vendetta, but for... We were surprised that José Luis Barbero appeared alone in the media. I didn't get the feeling that Marine land Majorca backed José Luis Barbero, rather it seemed that they were interested in... that separation, right? Obviously, As pro... wanted to stay out of it and remain unaffected. But it couldn't do that. WE ARE SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED As pro behaved very badly with him, because keeping silent is like admitting guilt. If you keep quiet, you are saying, "Well, yes." He must have been abusing and torturing animals. Which is outrageous because he's your employee. You can't wash your hands and play Pontius Pilate at the same time. Truth be told, As pro issued several press releases and José Luis was no longer an employee of the company. That is a really, really poor, technicality. Don't make me laugh. IMATA wanted to expel him from the association because of the video. He had lectured, taught problem-solving techniques, educated trainers, taught his methods. To be paid back like that must've been hard for him. José Luis must have felt immensely lonely at that moment. Who knows what was going on in that man's head? In the 80s and 90s, saying you were a dolphin trainer was fascinating to everyone. Today it is practically frowned upon. I sincerely believe that José Luis felt that the world he knew was slipping away like sand between his fingers. FEBRUARY 28, 2015 SOS DOLFINES MEETS WITH GEORGIA AQUARIUM INVESTIGATORS After a long meeting, they told us that the video was manipulated and the audio did not match the video. But of course, we remained calm because we knew we had everything we had. RECORDING OF THE MEETING Get the fucking ball! Hey! Lazy! Stop whistling and touch the fucking ball! Lazy! Are you dumb or what? Huh? Are you dumb? Hey! You're dumb! 15 DAYS 30 DAYS And we told them that we had many hours of footage that proved that the facts were real, that it happened not only once, but over a long period of time. And, well, when we showed them the images, they were stunned. RECORDING OF THE MEETING Then they committed to giving it to the Georgia Aquarium. They asked us not to publish that second video, but to wait because they wanted to take a public position on hiring or not hiring Mr. Barbero. THREE DAYS AFTER THE MEETING, JOSÉ LUIS BARBERO DISAPPEARS They told us they found my father at the Palma de Majorca airport. He committed suicide. I don't know how long he had been dead there at the airport... one or two days? They didn't tell us the cause or how he did it, either. And that's it. My father was always strong, you know what I mean? The truth is, I never meddled in his affairs. I regret that now. Now I regret not calling him to say... Because I always thought my father was the toughest person there is, mentally speaking. Because he always acted that way. ONE BASTARD LESS IN THE WORLD FUCK HIM FOR BEING A RETARD ONE THING IS FOR SURE: GOD IS SLOW... BUT HE DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES. I HOPE YOU SUFFERED IN YOUR DEATH I'M GLAD. AND HIS FUCKING FAMILY TOO When José Luis passed away, well... I was left alone. I don't know, it's... like your support system is gone. So... I lost it. My friends tried to help me. They succeeded. It took me a long time to leave the house, almost two years. I didn't feel like going out... I didn't want to. Because I was... I was ashamed. And because I thought that... people would go after me. That didn't happen, it was the opposite. After a year or so, I quit working with animals. Because I didn't feel the same anymore. And I realized that... No. I wasn't performing at work and... I was still in my head about it. I didn't feel the same way about animals anymore. Once José Luis Barbero passed away, we didn't hear from any association again, not from SOS Delfines or FAADA or anyone else. They chose to disassociate themselves. I was in shock, but... I can't feel something for someone I didn't know. I can't feel bad about it either. I didn't do anything wrong to feel bad about. If I felt bad, that would mean I feel guilty about something. And all I've done is film dolphins being abused. That's all I did. And those dolphins are still in Marine land. When José Luis Barbero left us and I was left in charge of the Majorca dolphinarium, difficulties arose when I started to resent decisions being made in Madrid, which did not favor the animals at all. All they took into account was... financial profit. At the beginning of 2017, As pro Ocio stopped trusting me and... You know what? I felt very relieved. I don't think I'd work with dolphins in captivity again. I'd like to work with dolphins again, but in a different way. Maybe in... thirty years all the captive dolphins in Spain, in Europe, will be released and relocated to sanctuaries or whatever you want to call them. Of course I would like to get involved in that kind of work. Maybe it's utopian, but I have always dreamed about that. - What? - It's nice. It's cool. Let's go to the beach like this tomorrow. It looks like I'm wearing a curtain here. Let's see, blink. Wink at me. José Luis was always making jokes. When we were with friends and we talked about dying or about that kind of stuff, he'd say, "I'll come down and check on you." Say hi to the audience, Mari. - Crap, I almost fell. - Fall down, come on. Look at that body. Those clouds are beautiful. Now I often tell him, "Come down, I really want to see you now." But he doesn't come down.
