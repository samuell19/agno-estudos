- And we are here. Don't be afraid to leave some of your belongings in the car. It will be less weight for you to carry and Pat will be sticking around to make sure all your things are safe. Take your time. There is no rush. They always take their time. - It's 'cause they're slow. They need their iPhone to understand all this crap. - Are you clocking out after this? - Yeah, my wife misses me. - How is she? - She's fine. Pregnant. - That's right. Congrats. - I guess. - I can never tell if you're being serious or not. - Hm. - All right, everybody ready? - Yeah. - Follow me this way. Now, it's very important that you guys don't touch the walls of the cave. The oils in your hands can corrode them over time. - Hey, why is that blocked off? - We don't go in there. - Why? Is there some kind of monster? - The caves are very unstable. A section of the caves collapsed over 20 years ago and it's been closed to the public ever since. But don't worry. These paths are perfectly safe. Anybody have any other questions? Anything? Yes, you. - Yeah, I was wondering if that one story about the missing girl in the caves is true. - You know, I've never been asked that before. - Really? So you don't know what happened? - No one really knows. My father was working here at the time actually and he told me he heard the girl found her way out by listening to the water. And that's all I really know. - The water? - Yes, from the creek. - That's not what I heard. - What did you hear? - I heard the girl couldn't find a way out and starved to death. - Well, everyone has their own theory and trust me, there are millions of them. So if you guys will follow me down here... - Oh good. Hey, you're back. I wanted to go over some last minute details with you before I jet out. How was the tour? - It was fine. - You sure? You look stressed. - No, no, I'm just tired. - Well, don't be. I need you to be awake and ready. Do you hear me? - Yes. Of course. I'm all ears. - All right. So I need you to make sure that the maids finish up with the rooms and the new girl, she's been kinda slow. And the bartender, he keeps forgetting to lock up the liquor cabinet, all right? And after the bar and restaurant closes, take all the money that we made including the receipts from the registers. I want you to put them over here in the safe and I'll leave the combination right here on my desk. And I think you know the rest. Sounds good? - Yes, I got this. - Uh, you sure? - Yes. Go on, get outta here. - Hey, don't need to tell me twice. Eh. Hey, thanks again for this. You know, I don't mean to put all this work on you last minute but I need to get outta this place. - Ah, it's totally fine as long as I get paid. - Ah, you will. Don't worry. Hey, your dad never worried about payment. - Uh, well, he was also a cheap guy. - He was a great guy. He was the best. I could tell you stories about him all day long. - So can I. - Hey, listen, I know this is your last year here and everything, but you know, if you change your mind and you wanna stay here, there's always a place for you, right? Could always use a Faust on my team. - Thank you. I really appreciate that. And I love it here, you know, I do. It's just it's time for some change, you know. I was basically born here so how sad's that? No offense. - Yeah, none taken, sweetheart. You got to have control of your life. I want you to remember that, okay? Gimme a hug. Have a good one and be safe. - Uh, you too. Enjoy your days off. - I will. And listen, don't forget what I said. It's super important, okay? And don't slack off and if you get tired, make coffee or something, all right? Yeah. You might need these. Yeah. - Why do you think it's okay to fucking kill a guy who makes such delicious salads? - All right. Okay. I'm just saying that he had good reason and it wasn't out of spite or vengeful. It was for the good of the Commonwealth. - It doesn't matter about your reasons or vengeance or spite. Fuck, man, he is the ruler, okay. And everybody loved him. So you think it's okay to pretend you know what's gonna happen in the future to justify killing him. - No, I'm just sayin', I think he got a bad rap. And if you really look at it, he might've been in the right. - Fuck you. That's warp, dish bitch. - It's Daemon. - Yeah sure it is. Not this fucking shit again. - Want me to go check it out? - No, no, fuck, dumb dumb. Your hands are fucking wet. I got this. Plus how many times I gotta tell you, I'm the only one who can do this. - Right, right. Success! - God! Fucking damn this fucking old piece of shit. Man, everything's fucking falling apart in here. Man, I'm telling you, I'm so glad we're almost outta here for a month so they can spend some time fixing this place up. Fucking the lights in the cave. Everything's fucking deteriorating. - Lights in the cave, what about 'em? - What? You didn't hear about this? The fucking lights in the cave keep going out. Supervisor insists we work on the reliable fucking lights and they keep going out. Shit, man, Val had a tour down there tripping dick and a half because of it. How do you not hear this shit, dish bitch? - Uh, I don't know. Just haven't heard I guess. - They're trying to sue us because of that. Do you know that? I wish they fucking did. Get outta here, get a new fucking job. - Ooh, almost off the clock. Thank God. - Fucking Coop. - Yeah I almost dropped a ton of dishes during that last blackout. - I think that drink is why you fucking almost dropped them dishes. - Yeah. What do you think? Is it time to do some shots or what? - Well, that depends. Done with all your dishes, dish bitch? - It's cool. You got your sidekick saying that too. - Well, it's fucking funny. - Yeah. It's pretty funny. So we still gonna hang out after this or what? - Get back to work, you savages! - Goddamn it, Val. - So I don't know about you guys, but I am ready for a shot. - Yeah, that's what I was just saying. Hey, are we still on for tonight? - Of course. We're going to be loud, dumb, and crazy tonight. - Amen to that. - But first, we have to make sure our jobs are done. So, Lucas, clean up your station. Cooper, make sure the liquor cabinet is locked. - I already cleaned. - And I can't pregame if I lock up the liquor cabinet. - I don't wanna hear any of your complaining. I will be in my office. - Man, kinda wish she's not leaving. - I don't really give a damn as long as they don't put that dick Justin in charge. - Yeah. Fuck Justin. - Let's get going, kiddo. Hey, I have something for you. I was gonna wait to give this to you but now seems like a good time. It was your mother's. She would've wanted you to have it. It's not really my style. - Thank you. - She'll always be here with us. You know that, right? - Yeah, I know. - And we'll always be here for each other, right? Unless, you put me in a home or something. Wait, you're not gonna put me in a home are ya? - It depends I guess. - You guess? All right You getting hungry? - Yes. - You wanna go get something to eat? All right, you choose. - Oh fuck. - Diane. - Hey, Val. How was your last tour? - Same as always. - Still excited to leave? - More than ever. Are you doing your job? - Yes, I'm almost done. I just came to get some cleaner for Gwen. - Everything okay? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just really tired. I've been here since eight. Oh, you know how it is? I shouldn't be telling you. - Are you sure? How's Steven? - He left already. He had to go. - Diane, tell me what's wrong. You know, I have a kind of sense for this stuff. - It's nothing really. It's stupid. - Tell me. - Before he left, I couldn't find my phone so I borrowed his and a text popped up. - From whom? - Gwen. - The new maid Gwen? - Yes. - Are you sure it was her? It had her name. It said, Gwen. Are you sure it was her? - Yes. And it said, "Thanks for last night" with a stupid smiley face. Fucking whore. - That can mean anything, you know? Have you talked to him about it? - No. I don't wanna do that. I don't know how to approach it. I'll just speak without thinking of what I'm gonna say. And I'll just insinuate and it'll just make everything worse. I can't do that. - I know something that can help you. - What? - The going away party tonight. Uh... - No, I can't do a party, Val. - A few of us are staying in a cabin. We're gonna have some drinks. It'll be fun. I mean, you need fun. Like when was the last time you had fun? - What about this place? We still have things to do before the renovation. - That is why we are spending tomorrow doing it. - I don't know, I feel like we should just get everything over with. - It's my going away party and I refuse to celebrate without you. - Will Gwen be there? - I don't know. - Fine. I guess I could use a drink or two. Can I share a bed with you or are you gonna be snuggling the dishwasher? - We will see where the night takes us. Now, do you wanna get this party started off right with a glass of cheap whiskey? - "Poseidon Adventure". Gene Hackman. It was a classic. - Leslie Nielsen. - Yes. - Who? - "Naked Gun". - "Don't call me Shirley". - Uh... Yeah, I don't see a lot of movies. - You see? Fuck, man. This is what's wrong with this country. Too busy focused on stupid shit. - Well, you guys are talking about movies. - Great movies. - Fucking classics. - Yeah, according to you two degenerates. - If being a degenerate means watching great movies, guilty as charged. - Yes. - I don't see you guys working. - Holy shit, Val! - You big baby. - Are we done? - We are done. - Yes! - Woo! - Except, is the liquor locked up, Cooper? - One sec. So are we good to go? - Almost. We're waiting for Diane and the new girl. - Is that Gwen? Fuck, dude, super hot. And I think she's single. She's cute. - Cooper, can you please get Gwen on the walkie talkie and ask how long she'll be? - Yeah, how long until Gwen's here? - Anything else you want? - That is it, I swear. - Thank you. - Okay. - Hey, Gwen, Gwen, come on back now. You got this? Gwen, you got a copy? Gwen, Gwen. Hey, Gwen. Gwen, Gwen. How you doing? Are you there? Got a copy? Gwen. - Don't you think she's hot? She is. - No, stop. - Come on. - You stop. - Nothin'. - Super hot, right? - Who we talking about? Gwen? - Yes! See. - So hot. - Told you. - We get it. That's workplace harassment. Be glad today is my last day. - Ah! And you love me. - And I love you. - All right, cheers. Let's fucking get this party started. - Cheers! - Woo! - Up. I have to make sure everything's in order before I get too fucked up. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Gwen. Gwen! Gwen! - Oh finally, did you get the cleaning stuff? Oh, hey, hey. I'm almost finished up here. So how's your last day? - Uh, it's all right. We're about to head over to the cabin. You're gonna come? - Yeah. Yeah. Is everybody gonna be there? - Yeah. Including Diane. So don't be a bitch and keep your distance. - Why? Did she finally admit she hates me? - Kind of. - Well, thanks for your honesty. - Look, yeah, you don't have to come if- - Oh no no. I wanna go. I just don't want Diane to make it all weird. She told me all these fucking stories about this room. And now she's talking about her husband- - You can do whatever you want. I mean, you can stay here and finish up and that's fine. Or you can come with us, take a break, and finish in the morning and that's fine too. - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. - Time to drink, dish bitch. - Dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, woo! - Go, boy. - I never liked ice skating as a kid, but now it is seriously so much fun. - You're still a fucking kid. - I hate ice skating. - That means you've never tried it. - No, I have tried it. I just could never get the hang of it. - I was the ice skating queen when I was younger. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. - I feel like we have more people on staff, don't we? Feels so small. - Most of the people already left. - Yeah, where the fuck's Patty? - Yeah. I love that guy. - Yeah. - He had to go home to Janet. - Who's Janet? - His wife. - Lame. - What about Leon? He never goes anywhere. I mean, what's he doing? - Who the fuck is Leon? - The groundskeeper. He's creepy. - Oh yeah, I know who we're talking about. Didn't he like go to jail or something? - That was forever ago. My aunt told me the story. He was a teenager I think. She said it was self-defense. - Oh shit, wait. He killed a guy? - I'm not a hundred percent sure. This is just what my aunt said. - Come on, tell us. - I don't know anything else. All I know is he was walking home one night and suddenly this man jumps him. So he takes out a knife. He stabs the guy. - Wait, the guy jumped him, so he killed him? - Like I said, I'm not a hundred percent sure. - Then why'd he go to jail if the other guy jumped him? - Because there was no evidence of him being jumped. There was just a dead body. - Yikes! Yo, we should hang out with that guy. - I don't know if I wanna stay in the same cabin as a convicted killer. - It was self-defense. - We don't know that. Diane said she wasn't a hundred percent. - I'm not. - All in favor of hanging out with the groundskeeper. That settles it. I'll go get him. - Do you know where he lives? - I'll figure it out. Hey. - We know each other? - Not really. Um... I, I work up at the lodge. I'm the new dishwasher. I'm Daemon. - What do you need? - Oh, well, you know Valerie and Diane? Well, Val and Diane and some of us we're hanging out up there having a little party. Thought maybe you wanna come. - Really? A party. - Yeah. - I don't really party anymore, man. - Oh, okay. - You know what, fuck it. I'll get ready. - Cool. - You wanna come in? - Sure. - Sorry, if the life's kinda sucked out of the place. I was just off to bed. - Oh, I hope I'm not bothering you. - No, man, not at all. I don't get asked to come out very much so can I get you something to drink? - Oh no. That's cool. We got a lot back up at the cabin. - Cool, man. Well, I won't be long. Make yourself at home. - Everything okay over there? - Yeah. You had a leaky faucet, but it's cool, I fixed it. - Thanks, man. - No problem. - How did you do that? I've been messing with this thing forever to get it to stop leaking. - Oh well, I'm a handy guy. Plus my dad was always a stickler for things like that around the house. - Fair enough. Well, I'm ready. How'd you get over here? - I walked. - You want a ride? - Sure. - All right, let's go. - I'm telling you, dude. Golf is not a fucking sport. - Yes, it is a sport. - How is it a sport? You fucking drive around in a golf cart. - Yes, but do you sweat? - No! Oh, if you're an old fat guy, maybe you sweat. - Then it's a sport for all fat guys. - Well, they're not, they don't have team jerseys. - Of course they fucking do, man. It's golf. You go on a team and you golf. - No. - It's a sport. - No! No, no, no, no, no. - Look at the Google definition. - No, you go after work. You drink beer and smoke cigarettes and fucking hang out- - I gotta pee! - with your buddies. But you scratch your balls- - Gotta pee. - and walk around all slow on a course. - You tell me a sport- - You take your own sweet ass time. where you don't scratch your balls. - Tell me... - That's the, another Google definition. Right there, sport. Scratch your balls. - I disagree. - Chess? - Chess is not a sport. - She's such a slut. - Diane. - That was a bit harsh. - Well, you hear the way she talks? She's just begging for attention. You know, if I ever talked to that way- - She is nice, okay? Can we just- - Not to me. She's a bitch. - I think she's cool. - Yeah. That's 'cause you wanna fuck her. - No, I wanna fuck you too. - Aw. Well thank you. - We're back. - There you guys are. We thought she got lost. - No, it just took me a little while to find his place. - Well, I know where he lived, but you never asked me. - Leon, hi. Welcome. I'm Valerie. I don't know if you remember my name. - Yeah, you're Donald's kid, right? - Yeah, yes. You knew him? - I knew of them. He's a bit of a legend around here. - Well, welcome. - Thank you. - Leon, right? - Yeah. - Beer? - Sure. Thanks, man. - Join the party. - See, my favorite class was history. - History? - What? You don't like it? - I mean, it's whatever. - Ah, I love it. It was the only class that would keep me going. I find it very fascinating. - Mine was theater. - Uh, yeah. No, I can see that. - And what is that supposed to mean? - Oh, nothing bad. It just... Like the way you tell stories on the tour. - What? Did you watch me? I have not seen you at any of the tours. - Well, may have snuck in once or twice. - That's weird. - Hey. Do you believe in the stories that you tell? - Am I supposed to? - I don't know. - Do you? - Yeah. I mean, why not? - I feel like that's kind of how I see you. This why not attitude. - Diane believes in ghosts. I know that for sure. - What did you just say? - Nothing. She didn't say anything, Diane. She said you believe in ghosts. That's all. - Yeah? And what do you have to say about it? - I was just saying. - Well, keep it to yourself. Don't make fun of me. I stayed in that room once. I saw it. - What? Like a ghost? - Yes. - It couldn't have been an imaginary friend? - It wasn't an imaginary friend. It was a ghost. - Okay, sure. How old were you? - Don't patronize me. - I'm not. - Can we please not talk about this? - No, no. She's the one who brought it up. - Because you keep bringing it up. - Don't test me, bitch. - Hey. Hey. That is it. Diane, I think it's time for you to go to bed. - No, I don't wanna go to sleep. - You've had enough. - Tell me about it. - Diane! Jesus Christ. Stop it! Take it easy. - Fuck you, whore! - Hey. - Please take her to the lodge. - I'll take her. Come on. Hey. - And I give that fight a 6.9. - You know, I respect myself. And she was just being a stupid little bitch. I can't... mm. Oh. - You all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm great. - Come on. Let's get you to bed. - Hey. Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Do you think I was out of line back there? - No, not at all. - Good. She was out of line. She was being a bitch. I don't know why she hates me so much. She gets all up in my face and then she projects everything going wrong in her fucking life onto me. - Maybe, but you didn't help in there. - What was I supposed to do? She was treating me like a child. How would you feel somebody was doing that to you, Val? - All right. You're right, all right. You're right. But what do you want me to say? There is no bad guy here. - She just threw her fucking drink in my face. - Maybe she had a reason. - She's jealous? - I don't know what you want me to say. Daemon is walking her back to the lodge so she's not stumbling around drunk. Do you wanna stay and forget about all this? Or do you wanna go back and finish your rooms? - I guess I'll take option B. - Fine. But don't go anywhere near Diane, okay? - Oh, I know where the bitch sleeps. No, oh ho ho. - Well, that looked like that went well. - How was Diane? - Mm, she was fighting it a bit, but she finally agreed to go to bed. How 'bout Gwen? - I'm a bitch. - How so? - I should have just let her go home, but I fucking yelled at her and I told her to finish her work. - That's taking charge. - I know. - My dad, he had this shop in town and fuck, I loved being there. You know, being at the shop, hanging out with the guys. Oh man, this guy, Lou, Uncle Lou. But fuck, he wasn't my real uncle. Just one of those dudes that really good friend with your dad, you know. - Right, right. - Fuck. He was Canadian, French Canadian. His real name was Louis. We were fucking at the shop one time and this storm's coming through. And my dad's like, "All right, let's close it down. Storm's coming through. We gotta close this shit down." And all of a sudden, boom, lights out, black, fucking black. There's no windows. It's a garage, man. Fucking uncle, Monsieur Louis, finds a firecracker in his pocket, pulls it out, and goes "All right, we got five seconds to find a fucking door." Everyone's scrambling. Can you imagine? We're like, oh shit! Boom, the thing goes off. Fucking, oh my God. Smoke alarm fucking goes off. Fire department had to come and get us out of there. - Yeah, I just liked the look and the sound of cars. I don't really know all the types or whatever. - Same. If it runs, I'm good. - See, Leon, this is why Coop here drives a piece of shit because he thinks that way. What do you drive? - A bike. - A bike. Are you shitting me? - Speaking of stories, Gwen said Diane believed in ghosts or some shit. - I don't know. Diane is going through something right now. She thinks Gwen is fucking Steve. - Who's Steven? - Her husband. - I wouldn't be surprised. - She said she saw a ghost, right? I mean, she's the one who claims room 510 is haunted. That's why I wanted a job here. - What, 'cause there's a haunted room? - No, 'cause there's a lot of shit here. It's a lot of unsolved mysteries. Like the Lillian story. That's what they call it anyway. - Ooh. Sounds scary. - Just wait. It was Lilian's honeymoon and long story short, she walked into the room and found her husband having an affair with the maid. - Eh, sounds familiar. - Yeah, well then she killed herself either by hanging or slitting her wrists or jumping out of the window. It was never really specified. Or maybe it was and I just forgot. - I think you could tell the difference. - I heard she pushed the maid out the window and then jumped with her after she realized what she'd done. - You're probably right but after that Lillian's ghost never left. It's said that whenever someone enters the room, she goes and wanders the hallways. It's also said that she'll hide in a closet and moan and cry. Other than that, she's probably the most benevolent ghost you could ever meet. Unless you have bad mojo. Then you walk in the room, you need to be scared. - Bullshit. - I wouldn't say that. - Why? Can she hear me? - If she senses you don't believe her story, then she fucks with you. - Dude, you sound like my dad trying to tell a ghost story. Quit while your ahead. - Oh, I got a better one. - Go for it. - Well, this happened when I was in high school. There's this kid that lived around here. Didn't really have anybody. No friends, shitty home life. And then this girl named Sarah came to the lodge one season. - Hey, hi. Are you staying here too? - No, not really. My dad's the groundskeeper so we live close by. - Is your dad here? - No, it's Sunday so he's at home watching the game. - Ah. Football? - Yeah. - Yeah, we had to force my dad be out here as well. Are you a football fan? - Uh, no, not really. - You're kinda strange. - I'm sorry. - No need to be sorry. I'm just as strange. Oh, watch this face. See, I'm weird. I like weird people. - Sarah, we need to get going. Your dad's waiting. - Okay, well, I gotta go. - Bye - Hey, Sarah. Mom says time to go. - Bye. - Kid got attached quickly. He was happy to actually have someone that cared about him. And for the first time in his life, he had someone that loved him. Well, that was at least till he found out that Sarah was leaving and, you know, this kid just really didn't like that. He just made this new friend and didn't wanna see her go. He remembered this spot where his mom would take him to whenever his dad got shit-faced and abusive. Was over by where you do the tours, Valerie. He took Sarah into those caves. - So, so what? What'd he do to her? - He left her. I mean, he didn't wanna hurt her or anything. He just didn't wanna see her go. I guess how his mom did. He was found on one of the trails by a search party looking for Sarah. He wouldn't say a word about what had happened. He just shut down, went completely catatonic. No and since they never found her or anything, they couldn't charge him with a crime. Coincidentally enough, his father just so happened to go AWOL that same night. He didn't have any other family that could take care of him so state didn't have any other choice but to send them to a mental hospital. Last I heard he's still there. - Did they ever find Sarah? - There's different variations. Some say they found her body. Some say she fell down a shaft in the fucking caves. Some say the kid's father kidnapped her. Others say that she found her way out by listening to the sound of water. - I'll walk out with you. - Bye, Leon. - See ya, dude. - Cool ghost story, bro. - That guy was fucking nutty. - Yeah, that got weird. - I got awkward. - You two are babies. - That story didn't freak you out in the least bit? He knew so much detail. - He reads a lot. He said that. - Bullshit. That's his life story. How the fuck am I supposed to sleep with some fucked up dude sleeping yards away? - Okay, yeah, now I think he's over-exaggerating. - All right, dude. Well, that was fun. - Yeah, it was cool evening. Fuck, man, I'm sorry if I killed the vibe in there. I just fucking don't get out very much. - No, man, it's not you. Don't worry about it. - Well, you wanna do it again, you know where to find me. - For sure. All right, well, drive or ride safe. - Right on, man. I'll see you next time. - I can't be the only one who felt that, right? Seriously, you guys. - How much did you drink? - Clearly not enough. - What time is it? - It's almost one. - It's that early? - Well, I'm down to stay up if you are. - Yeah. Anybody else wanna hang out? - Boo! - Okay, man. - Nope. I'm going to bed. I call the extra room. - Wanna share? - No! Fuck, Coop. Keep the couch. - Oh oh. - Do you wanna just take some drinks upstairs? - Yeah. Sure. Definitely. - Okay. All right. Good night, guys. Great work today by the way. - Yeah, no worries. I'll just be here alone. That's okay. I got Judy. - That's so... - Well... - Then what? - Uh! So then we broke up. High school wasn't really the best for me. - Oh, me neither. I hated it. So fucked up. I barely even remember it. - Because you were so fucked up? - Well, that too. - So what are you doing after this? Do you have a job lined up? - Mm, not really. Probably just gonna be unemployed till this place opens up again. - Well, if you want, and only if you want, I could ask my uncle about a job. He runs a restaurant and that's where I'm gonna be working after this. - Well, yeah. I mean, why not? Will I have to be a dish bitch? - Well, now that I've seen how well you wash plates, probably. - Fair enough. - Ah. Now I'm tired. And I'm drunk. - Well, we should probably tuck you in then. - Oh, you're gonna tuck me in? - I mean if you want. - Please. - Good night. - Good night. - Just like that we're gonna catch a fish. - How long do we have to wait? - Oh, that's the thing about fishing. Takes patience. It's kinda metaphorical when you think about it. - Metaphorical? - Oh yeah, you know, it has meaning to it. That's the thing about life. You can't just rush into it. You need patience. Otherwise you get overwhelmed. You know what overwhelmed means, right? - Yes, Dad. - Well, I'm just checking. When I was your age, I didn't even know what it meant. - I have Mom's genes I guess. She was smarter. - Well, that's true. But don't talk to me that way. So what are you writing over there? - Nothing. Just stuff. - Stuff, eh. Well, I like stuff. What kind of stuff we talking? - I don't know. - Sounds exciting. - I don't know how to explain it. - Is it like a diary or something? - Well, kind of. - Your mom used to love to write. You keep at it, you'll become a big time writer. - Maybe one day I can take over the tours too, or at least help you out a little. - Hey, you know, I don't want you to think that you need to be stuck with your old man. I appreciate the help, but I think you need to see the world. It's something that me and your mom really wish we could have done more of. - Where do you think she is? Like, do you think there's a heaven? - Well, I don't know. Not knowing's not so bad. Wherever your mom is, she's doing just fine. - Do you miss her? - Yeah, every day. But I got you. You look just like her. It's like she never left. - Hey, Dad. - Yeah. - I'll always be here for you. - Oh, looks like we got one. Here, take it. - Shit. Fuck! Oh! What the hell are you doing? - Oh, I was just using the bathroom. Did you hear that noise? - Yes. And the power is out again too. - You guys hear that shit? - Yeah. - And the power's off too. - Yeah, we know. - Did you guys hear that? - Yes. - Sounded like somebody broke a window. - Fuck, do you think someone's breaking into the lodge? - You want me to go check? - It's my job. I gotta check. - Wait, I'll go with you. - Shit. Wanna join 'em? - Sure. - Slow down. - If someone's breaking in there, I could lose my job. - Well, you're not working here anymore anyway so what's the difference. - That's not funny. Oh my god. How did this happen? How could this fucking happen? - Fuck! Oh, fucking Diane. - Think she did it? - Well, look what the fuck? - Diane is incapable of murdering anyone. - Then explain this, Val. - What happened? - Jesus Christ. Where the fuck did you come from? - I heard a crash and screaming. - Look, let's just go back inside and we'll talk about it in there. - The fucking power isn't working in there. - I was just gonna say that. - I'm gonna go get help. - Wait, don't go alone. I'm going with her. Don't touch anything. Stay put. Wait. - Like I'm dying to touch a dead body. - Fuck you fuck. - What? - The phones are working. - Shit. - My god, I don't know what to do. I don't know what the fuck is happening? - Hey, hey. Hey, calm down. It's okay. Hey, I'm gonna get my car. We'll go to town and I'll get help, okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Come on. - Did you guys get help? - Phones are dead. - Ah, so we're fucked. - No, I've got my truck. We're gonna go to the nearest gas station. We'll get help. - Okay. Well I think... Fuck, maybe we should all go just in case. - No. No, we can't just leave them. - I'll stay. - Perfect. Fucking Leon's staying here. Let's get the fuck outta here. Fuck, Coop! - Fucking kidding me, right? - Hey, the car won't start. - What? - My car won't start. Can you drive us? - Ah, fuck, yeah. Let me clear some shit out of the back. - It's fucking freezing out here, dude. Gimme your keys. Fuck! - Stop trying to start the car and pop the fucking hood. Fuck! - What? - Someone fucked with the cars. - What do you mean? - I mean, Val, someone fucked with the fucking cars. We're not going anywhere. - What do you mean? Well, what do we do? What's the next step? - What are you looking at me for? You're the one who's in fucking charge. I don't know. - I don't know what to do. My dad would be furious with me right now. - Your dad? - We're gonna talk- - Fuck you, Cooper! About your fucking dad? - Fuck you! - We gotta get the fuck outta here. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Calm down. - I agree, guys. Let's go back inside. - Coop, are you fucking nuts, man? I'm not going back inside until we get some help. Look, let's just walk to the next town. - That's 15 miles away. - Yeah, I fucking know that, Val, but it's better than being here. - Wait. Shut the fuck up. Have an idea. Hey, I really appreciate this. I mean, everybody's freaking out. Thank you. - No worries, man. - We'll be here. - Leon, do you want someone to come with you? - No, I'll make it much faster on my own. You guys just chill in the cabin. Someone needs to just go check the breaker box. A fuse probably blew. - Do you guys think we can actually trust this guy? - What choice do we have? Okay. I'll check the breakers. Hey, Sue, do you wanna help me? - Fuck you, dish. Allow me. I'm the only one who can do it. - How could I forget. - Daemon, you want a drink? - No. Thank you. I'm good. - How's the fire going? - It's good. - What's that? - Stay put. I'm gonna go check it out. - What? You're gonna go alone? - I'll be right back. - What? What, don't tell him he's fucking dead now too. No fucking way, man, no fucking way. What the fuck are we gonna do? - Wait. - Fuck! Fuck. - Hey! Hey. Get your shit together. Look. Look, Leon's coming back. He's gotta get help. I can feel it. If there really is somebody out there and they're trying to do something to us, we need to stick together, keep our shit together. We gotta be ready, all right? - What if they're already in here then what? - That's why we need weapons and we need to think fast. But don't worry, Leon's coming back. - Leon? What if Leon's the one behind all this? - Hey, don't think like that. - He's fucking crazy. He's a loon. He's the only one that wasn't here when we found Gwen and Diane. He's the only clear suspect. He's the one that told us to check the breaker box. He probably fucked with it. And we were all together all night long except for when you two went upstairs to have your little chat. - I don't care. - You don't care? - No. - You don't care. - No, I don't care. - Fuck. - For all, I know you could be the one that's behind all this. - You think I could be capable of this shit? - Obviously not. That's my point. We have to stay positive. - Positive? - Yes. - Stay positive. - Yes. - That's what we're gonna do. Stay positive. - Okay fine. You can stay here and wallow in your alcoholic paranoia and self pity, but I'm gonna go find some weapons. - What about Val? - I'm taking her with me. - You guys are just gonna leave me here, alone? - You don't have to be. - Fuck it. I'll stay. - You want me to just grab anything? - Yeah. Anything that's hard and can take somebody down. - I don't see anything good. - Can use anything. - Wait, I know where there's something. - Okay. Does it have any bullets? Perfect. - What do you want me to do with it? - I want you to hold it. I don't trust that bartender guy. And I don't know, maybe we shouldn't trust Leon either. - Maybe you should carry it. - No. I want you to have it. Look, I have enough weapons in this bag. This is a backup. If anything bad happens, we shoot, or you shoot. Hey. Hey, I won't let anything bad happen to you. Okay? You trust me? - Yes. - Good. Now hide the gun. - I got something for you, Leon, huh? Yeah. Wanna fuck with me? No, fuck with me no how. Yeah. Come on down. I'll dust the plate off for you. There we go, buddy. - Good. You found yourself a weapon. - No thanks to you. Where is she? - Who? - Fucking Val. Where the fuck is Val? - Checking on the backup generator. - You sent her there alone? - She'll be all right. - Ow. - Did you find anything good? - Yeah. - This for? - Flame thrower? - Flame thrower? - Yeah. A flame thrower. - Yeah, a flame thrower, great. Fucking spray butter flame thrower. You saved us, bro. Great job. What? - I think you need to chill out. - I'm perfectly fine with my attitude. Thank you very much. - You're drunk. - Thanks, I didn't notice. You know what? I'm starting to think that maybe you had something to do with all this. - Excuse me. - I know it's funny, huh? But just go with me for a second. None of us had ever met Leon before until you brought him up last night. That's when shit started going downhill. - And your point? - My point, sir, is that you guys have got some kind of weird little plan going on. You've got all of us together up here for some reason. Maybe it's money or... money, I don't know. I don't have it figured out yet, but you got some kind of little scheme. - Congratulations. You caught me. - Leon, are you okay? - I told you. He fucking did it. - What the fuck are you doing? - Which one of you fuckers cut my brake lines? - Whoa, whoa. Calm down, brother. We already got one loose cannon here, okay? What happened? - Rode off a fucking cliff. - Looks like you fucked up your arm, bro. - I don't give a fuck about that. I want some fucking answers right now. - You want some fucking answers? I want some fucking answers too. - Look, nobody's getting any answers with your arm like that. Let me help you fix it. All right? Come on. Ah, there we go. Oh. Did you drink all the alcohol? - Plead the fifth, fucker. - Stay put. I'm gonna get the first aid kit. - You got a fucking problem? - I don't know, do I? - What happened to the others? - Well, Lucas went to check the breaker box. Val went to see if there's a backup generator. And now Lucas is fried and we still haven't heard back from Val. All start it happening right about the same time you showed up. Funny that, huh? - Funny, yeah. I got... - Easy. - I got one for you. Just riding down the hill on my bike to help you fuckers, go to use my brakes and realize I don't have any. Funny, huh? - Maybe it was just your bike. - I take care of my bike. - Yeah, well maybe, just maybe, you didn't even wreck your bike. - Yeah. I just fucking broke my arm just to fuck with you, huh? - Don't listen to him, Leon. He's drunk. - My drunkenness has nothing to do with this. - Well, what the fuck are you insinuating then? - Exactly what you think I'm insinuating. I think you fucking did it. - Me. Yeah. - Just sit still. Don't take it personally. He just got done accusing me and Val. - Well, now that I believe. - What? - You two do make the perfect little team, don't you? - See, that's what I fucking said. - I don't care what either of you think. All I know is that I'm not gonna die tonight. - I second that notion. - What? - Can I ask you something, Leon? Why did you get arrested? Story Diane told was that the, they put you away for murder. - This is not the time. - No, you're right. I went to prison for manslaughter after a guy tried killing me. - Yeah, he tried killing you? - You don't have to tell us. - No, it's good, man. So when I was younger, I was at this bar and I met this girl. Hey, what do you got on tap? You got any good IPAs? I'll have that one. Hello. - Hey. - Is anyone sitting here? - Um, no, go ahead. - I pretty much come here every Friday night. I've never seen you here before. What's your name? - Penny. - Penny, nice to meet you. Thank you. I've been coming here since like 19 aught two. Not allowed to cross the street or something? - Something like that. - Yeah? Huh. Hey, don't go crossing the street. I'll be right back. - Okay. - What the fuck you think think you're doing? - I didn't do anything wrong! - That's fucking bullshit. He's a dead man. - What the fuck? - No, Will, what the fuck do you think you're doing? - Fucking bitch! - What do you think you're doing? I didn't do anything wrong. No, get the fuck away from him. Get the fuck of him! - And so they arrested me. Locked me up. Gave me five years for man two. The end. - Well... That's some story you got there, Leon. Seems like you're a guy that's capable of quite a bit. Maybe a person who's got some things that have happened in his past he's not too proud of. Things that maybe he doesn't quite understand. Kinda things that make a person lose his mind and wanna kill a bunch of innocent people. - Keep fucking talkin'. - What are you gonna do? Kill me? - Keep pushing my buttons, mother fucker. - Oh, I'll pushing 'em. I'll push 'em all night. Hey, man. - Oh, no, let him go. What's he gonna do, kill me, huh? - Shut up. - Wants? - Stop it. - Fucking yeah. - Stop it. Need you guys to keep it together just until morning, okay? Just until morning. All right? Truce. Truce. Shake on it. See, it's not so hard. - Hey stop! - Guy's fucking... - Whoa, whoa, we don't wanna - If you're all gonna turn... - do that, man. - What's... - Hey. - Hey, stop! - Hey, you guys! Stop! Oh my God. - God Dammit! - Hey. - Gimme that. - Hey! - You saw what he did. He attacked me. I did what I had to do. - Don't move. - Just calm down. Just calm down, Val. - Please stop! - Val. Just calm down. Just calm down. - Please stop. - Val. Fuck. - Oh no. Cooper. - God. - Coop? - I want to... Please God. Help me. - I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. What do I do? I don't know what to do. I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. - I don't wanna die. - It's okay, Coop. Oh, thank God. - What? - Are you okay? - No. What happened? - I killed. I killed him. - Who? - Leon, babe. I shot him myself. I think I killed him. - Uh. - I wanna, I wanna get out of here. Where are we going? - I know of a place that we can go. - Where is it? - It's where my mom used to take me. Trust me. - Daemon, where the hell are we? - Don't worry. I know where to go. - I don't like it out here. I think we should've just stayed. - It's a lot safer than where we just were. - I just wanna go home. - Just follow me. - I'm sorry if you're getting annoyed by me- - I'm not annoyed. Fuck! I just... no matter what I say or do, this shit always seems to happen to me. - What? - It's complicated. This way. - What the fuck, Daemon. These are the caves. What are we doing here? - It's the perfect place to hide. If anyone sticks their head around the corner, we'll blow it off. Plus we know these parts. - I think that's a bad idea. I think we should just head back. He's not in there anymore. - Do you have a better idea? Look, he can't sneak up from behind us in here. We can wait it out until morning and then we'll go for help. We'll be safe in here. Now, gimme the keys. My phone's almost dead. - Fuck, I left mine at the fucking cabin. - Fucking... it's okay. We'll be safe. Just stay close. - Wait, no. I've never been in there. - Exactly. He won't think to come in here. What? - I don't like it in there. - Are you scared? You do these tours all the time. What's the difference? - Never in there. - Valerie. - I wanna go home. - Do you trust me? - It's not that. - Then what is it? If we don't trust each other, then we have nothing. It died. - Then why don't we just stay right here? - No, we have to keep going. - We have to get help. - You are not helping in this, Val. - Daemon, you're hurting me. - I am? - Yes. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I didn't mean for- - It's okay, Daemon. - I'm not scared to be in here. What are you most afraid of right now? - Never ever waking up in my own bed ever again. - Don't be. I won't let anything happen to you, Sarah. Okay? Oh no. Don't, don't cry. Why are you crying? - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, don't apologize. I don't, I'm not looking for an apology. I just... I wanna be forgiven. I want forgiveness. I don't know why I am this way. Maybe it was my dad. I ever tell you about my dad? - No. - He worked here. - Here at the lodge? - Yeah. He was a groundskeeper. He was angry. - Please rise when addressing the Court. - Yes, sir, your courtship. - Your Honor. You can call me Ken. - Where are you been? - Any attempt at humor will be dealt with severely. - I was out. - You're being sued for $5000. - By yourself? - Do you consider that funny? - I was with this girl. She's nice. - No, sir. - Hm. Did you go to school? - Are you represented by counsel? - Yeah. - Now, why I do that? - Lawyer? - I don't know. - Oh no, sir. - Liar! - You're appearing in pro per. - I don't. - The school called. You never go. You never go to work. You're as lazy as your fucking mom. And I say that with love. - Speak for the plaintiffs, so make yourselves exchange. - You got anything to save for yourself? - I don't like it there. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Well, that's life, kid. You're not supposed to like it. - You appear today. - They look at me weird. - I have persuaded them to come to court. - That's because you look stupid. That's why your mother left. - Wreaked by this criminally careless family. - Now, come on. I'm just kidding. Would you go grab me another beer, kiddo. - Granny. - Just Granny. The voters and their... - I hate you. - Oh, you hate me, huh? Is that what I heard? You don't want me around here? - No, that's not what I said. - So now I'm hearing shit, huh? - No. - You don't want me around. You think you can have all this without me providing for you? - No, I didn't say that. - Hell with that. Get over here. - No, please! - Nope, you asked for this. - Please! - Shut up! Come on. - Yeah, it was tough. - I'm so sorry. - Why? You didn't know. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It's just family shit, you know? - It's okay. I just wanna go home. - Don't worry. It's not for you. - You're not letting me go home. - No, I kinda want you to go. - You're not coming with me? - I can't. - We can get you help. - That never works. What's wrong? - I just don't like it in here. This place scares me. - Well, don't worry. It'll all be over soon. You're lucky. You have a perfect life. - What perfect life? I just wanna go home! I just wanna go. We can go together. We can try to fix this. - I know you don't want this. No one wants this. But in reality... You have everything. And I have nothing. I don't wanna hold you back anymore. - What is there here for you? Go ahead and leave. But you're gonna have to do it without me. - No, Daemon! No! No! - Yeah, you got yourself in a bit of a situation, huh? - I just don't know how to end it. - Well, you want a happy ending? - Is that realistic though? - Well, you got a point there. I don't know. I mean, it could be realistic to have a happy ending if you know what you're doing? - How would you end it? - Well, let's think about what your character is going through. She's stuck in a tough spot. She's alone. She's cold. She's losing all hope. But then she sees a light at the end of the tunnel. - She's not in a tunnel. - Well, I know that. It's a metaphorical tunnel. Let's see. Oh, I got it. She breaks through the window. She grabs a sheet off the bed and then she rappels out the window, she gets help, and she saves everybody. - Forget it. I'll just work on it later. - What, you don't like my idea? - I do, but I don't know. - Hm, fair enough. - Did they ever find that little girl? - Little girl. What little girl? - The one in the caves? - Oh. Ah, no, no, not yet. - That's so sad. That's why I don't like being in there. - Yeah, it's easy to get lost in there if you don't know your way around. - And it's so dark and cold. I don't know what I would do. - Well, that's why we're gonna go tomorrow and show you around so if you're ever in a situation like that, you'll know what to do. - Even then, didn't you get lost in there? - Yeah. Just about half a dozen times. - How did you find your way out? - Yeah, well the first time was pretty tough. It was so dark, it was pitch black. My flashlight died. Luckily I had my walkie with me. I had your Uncle Charlie help me out. The second time was a lot easier. I just listened to the water. - To the water? - Yep. I just listened to the stream and followed it all the way out to the light. You know, I like to think that that's what that little girl's doing now. Now, if you ever find yourself in a situation like that, I want you to know that I'll always be with you even if I'm gone. You'll know what to do. - Listen to the water? - Listen to the water. Love you, kid. - I love you too, Dad. - You'll know what to do. - Okay. - We got a - Please help me. - Well, lay it down. Ma'am, are you okay? - They're all dead. - Are you okay? - Thank God, thank God. - Okay, all right. In my vehicle, tell me what happened. Can I get additional units out here please? Dispatch, I need additional units out at Big Creek Road ASAP.
