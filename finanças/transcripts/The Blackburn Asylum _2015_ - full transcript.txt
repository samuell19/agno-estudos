I stopped feeling below my waist, like an hour ago. Luke, how did you guys meet anyway? I was at a house party and I looked over and there she was. Like this blonde goddess and I just knew at that moment, Ryan was there talking to her... Look, it's dad! Do you want me to grab something? No, I'm just gonna leave this stuff here, I'll come back and get it. Okay. Wow! We're in Alaska! Land of the frontier, right? We're going... Where are we going? Daddy's going to work. Yeah. Oh, this place is kind of creepy. That's a little dark. Alright, I'll get my stuff. Okay, let's do this. Wow. -It's like they just walked off. -Yeah. I wonder why. I don't know. Come on, let's go this way. So Bill really wants to reopen this place? Honey, who knows. Guess we'll see. Look, honey, you stay here with the baby. I'll be right back. Okay. You wanted to come. Yeah, I know. Okay, stay tight, I'll be right back. Hello? Anyone there? Please don't tell me I have to deal with squatters now. Rob, I think someone's up there with you. Ah, I don't see anyone. You know what Hun, why don't you go back to the car. It's more comfy. I'll be a while up here. No, we'll, we'll come up there with you. Rob? Rob? Rob! Rob! Rob? Please! Please, don't hurt us. My baby. Please. Hey, babe. Can you pull over? I got to take a piss. Yeah, sure. Oh, Jesus. Where are we? We haven't had any service since like... ...wherever we were this morning. -Who are you trying to text? -I'm not trying to text. I'm trying to upload the picture of the day, and I'm also trying to find a catalogue for Burberry. I need a new tote. Already? Didn't you get one at Christmas? Yeah. I need a new one. Oh, and Brittany... ...bought the exact same one that I have, like two days after I got mine. She, single white females me all the time. People just want to wear what I wear. Hey, I bet you're really glad I invited you on this trip. Are you sick of my friends yet? Yeah. Especially this fucker. Fuck. That's disgusting. Fuck you! Thanks, buddy. -You're a piece of garbage. -Thank you. That means a lot. God. -Luke. -Yeah? -I'm hungry. -Oh, okay. Alright. We have chips and peaches. That's it. I think there's salmon at the cabin. -Do you have any beer? -You drank all that. That's like two hours away. And I can't eat chips. Well, what's wrong with peaches? Peaches have way too much sugar. It's really bad for your skin. -My God, seriously? -Yeah. What? Whatever. I'm proud of my face. -I like it a lot. -Hey, hey. I would love your face and you no matter what. Don't! Don't. -That is a terrible thing to say, and no. -Oh, okay. Well, on that note, shall we get the fuck out of here? Jade! Come on. -Hey, guess what. -What? I didn't wash my hands. That's super cute. It's gonna be a cold night. We'll be fine. How much farther to the cabin? Probably a couple of hours. Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Are you guys okay? Yo, give me, give me the keys. No, I'm okay to drive. -I'm just... -Even drunk, I'm a better driver than you. You guys, I'm so sorry. It just happened so fast. Okay well, can you maybe look where you're driving next time? It was an accident. Nothing happened. Okay? We're good. This doesn't look good. Holy shit! Hey. Hey. Hey. -Oh, my God! -My God. -Hey. You okay? -Shit! Fuck! Oh, my God. What are you doing? Hey, babe, what are you doing? I'm pulling her out. She's dead. What are you going to do with her? Well, what are we supposed to do? Just leave her here? Does anyone have reception? No. I'm out. I got nothing. I am not riding with her in the Jeep. Yeah. Babe, she's dead. -Just leave her. -We cannot just leave her here. Let's get to the jeep and find some help. Who's gonna help us? We haven't seen anyone for miles. We'll drive until we get to cell coverage and call 911. Okay. Okay. We've got to turn around. Why? Why can't you just, four wheel whatever and and get over that? It's a four by four, not a hovercraft. -What? -Shit! Go! Go, go, go. I can't believe we just left her there. We didn't have a choice. I can't stop seeing her eyes. Oh, my God! Wow! Oh, my God! The road's closed. We... We're just trying to get to our cabin in Tok, and the road is blocked about 50 miles back with a rock slide. We saw a car crushed with someone in it. Okay. You can't get through. The fire jumped the highway up ahead, so it's closed off for the next five miles or so. You're gonna have to turn around. -Okay. -Seriously? Do you know anywhere we can spend the night? Sorry. I'm not from around here. Alright. I'll guide you guys out. Okay? Just turn around right here. Okay. We may have to spend the night outside. Are you stupid? All my shit's back at the cabin. No. Yeah. We have no gear. We'd freeze our nuts off. We'd have to sleep in the car. Seriously? I saw a sign for gas 15, 20 minutes ago. This is super stupid. You're kidding me? Maybe we should keep looking. No, I'm totally out. Well, I need some kale or something. We'll check it out. Hold on, hold on. You're always running away from me. This place sucks. I could live here. Alone. Hello? Should have kept driving. I agree. Hey. There's a gold mine here. We should check it out. At least while we're stuck. Hello? -Hey, you hungry? -What? That is... ...so gross! Yeah. What are those, like brain, -like brain parts? -I don't know, I don't know. Hey, we'll figure it out. Don't be gross. Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Your door was open. And... Well, we need some gas. Ain't got no gas. Okay. Well, we just saw the pumps and we thought that, you know, maybe you might have... ...gas. Where did she go? This is a gas station right? Told you before, ain't got no gas. Wow, she was... -How... -...just right there. Did you do that? From, from, from... Is there a...? That's a got... She... -What's going on? -Holy fuck! There's a, there's a woman. -And, and she, she keeps appearing... -And she's everywhere. -And then she just reappears. -And then she disappears! -Wait, what, what woman? -You know, an old, old woman. An old woman that's like seven, 800 years. -She flies! -It's not funny! Can we help you dears? There's two of them. Hi, we need some gas and some food, and we're hoping we can find a place to spend the night nearby. Good luck with that. Gas truck ain't been through here for a week. And nowhere to stay. -You like the cat? -Yeah. Does he have a name? His name is Rigor Mortis. Let's just grab some food and get out of here. Okay. So, what's in this one? Haggis. Alright, so I have a feeling we're spending the night in our car. That's nice. You like this one? Yeah. I didn't know you hunted. I don't. I used to shoot on a 3D team. Are you a good shot? I don't know, it's about being able to judge distance on demand. It shoots 340 feet per second. -Really? -I reckon it's set to your draw length. You're probably a 25. -Maybe 26. -Yeah, I'm 25. Of course, it's minimum weight range is 40 pounds. Can we get gas anywhere else? Sure about 75 miles north. That's past the rock slide. Go on. -Why don't you try it? -Really? Take it outside. That was like... ...two weeks ago. Do you guys have any real weapons, like a gun? This is a real weapon. This can shoot through Kevlar. And at 40 pounds, this could kill a moose. Bullshit. There's your target. Put it right between the eyes. That'll kill a silver-tip for you. Clean through the fridge. It was a fridge. It's an easy shot. And what's a silver-tip? Jesus! That's a silver-tip. -Oh, my God! That was priceless. -Dude, shut up. This is the smoothest speed bow. -No, I know, I'm just, I'm not... -Jade, please don't, don't talk. Don't, don't talk okay? What's up, ladies! Or whatever the hell you are. Look, we're not hunters. Okay? We're college students. Do you know what a college is? It's like a school, only not for inbreds. Ryan! -So here's what you're gonna do. Luke. -Yeah. You're gonna get behind the counter. You're gonna ring all this stuff up. And you're gonna tell us how to get out of this fucking hellhole. There's nothing around here. Hey, guys, you gotta come see this. There are people that are like missing from around here. It's really creepy. Okay, we should get a lighter too. That's gonna be 10 bucks. Done. Thank you. What about the mine? -Could we stay there? -No! Stay away from there. Okay. Why? What's there? Nothing. There ain't nothing there. Just ghosts. -What kind of ghosts? -Kind that kills you. Ghosts don't kill you. -Some do. -Some do. Ladies, one more question. Did you guys, did you guys make this? Because if engineering doesn't work out for me, I thought maybe I could be going into taxidermy. You guys seem very successful. -You want to learn about this? -Yes, I do. Follow me. Asshole. Ryan. You start by catching and killing an animal. Or your pet. Now, if you've done it right, fur's real soft. And he looks as good as he was when he sat on your lap. Oh, my God. It's their... Now, that there silver-tip, he was flesh mounted. Using a scalpel. You gently remove the skin of the dead animal, -and then you... -I changed my mind. -I don't give a shit. -Yeah. Thanks, ladies. You know, I really wish we could've stuck around... ...and seen how it's actually done. -You just might. -You just might. Why do you have to be such an ass? -Seriously? -Yes! Who gives a shit? They're just a bunch of psycho rednecks. Oh, my God! Fuck my life! Seriously, Chels, stay to your right. Okay, guys, shut up! And just push, okay? This is harder than it looks. -Go, go, go! -Get in, get in, get in! Get in, guys. Don't go in the ditch. Ah, shit. We're at the bottom of the hill. We can't coast anymore. Oh, I see a shoulder. Yes. Aren't you glad you came with us? Next time, I'll choose the destination. Oh, yes. Would you? Please? Hey, we passed that car earlier. Yo, I'm checking it out. Here, keys. They left the trunk open? Maybe they forgot to shut it? It's weird. They left this here like they were coming back to get it. Maybe they found a place to stay for the night. I think we should go look for them. We should check it out. Let's do it. Come on. Fine. It's not like we have anything else to do. We could spend the night outside. Our gear's back at the cabin. You know, if we all just cuddle up. I'm not sleeping outside. Enough of your stupid ideas. I think this is the mine. Yeah. Not sleeping in there either. Yeah, but we could check it out. Maybe there's gold in that old mine. Going in. Come on, babe. -It'll be fine. -It's not. Be on my side! Okay, okay. -But I love you. -Yeah, I know. What the hell is that? That's a baby crying. They're in there. They're in there! Hello? What? They're in here somewhere. You guys. I'm really freaking out. It's like really, really dark in here. Be careful. Walk slowly. You'll adjust. Hey, guys. Check this out. Oh, who really would... Would go in there with a, with an infant? I mean, the little, the baby lungs in here. The cold. And the... I mean, it can't be good for anyone. I mean, myself included. Okay. Alright. We're doing it. Hey, I think we should probably split up. And statistically speaking, splitting up has always worked out for people in situations like this? Yeah, we can cover more ground. Alright. Okay. Do what you want. Okay. Alright. So, where do you think this gold is anyway? Some mine shaft. We hopefully won't have to go down in. Luke! Are you okay? Shit! Dude, you okay? What the hell is this? Come on, looks like someone lives down there. You good? Wow. -Okay. -I wish I had charged my phone... ...or had a flashlight or something. -Do you have anything? -No. I'm armed with nothing. Except for a recent tetanus shot. No shit. Hey, I'm really sorry I dragged you into this. Into what? This is fun. Thanks for inviting me. This is fun? You need to get out of your lab more. Well, plus this way, if you have a sudden emergency question about cell signal transduction, I'm on hand. I never thanked you for your help. You were a really great TA. Thank you so much. My pleasure. And, you know, you didn't need a lot of help. Once you were caught up, you're pretty good on your own. You know, biochem is just one of those things... ...you really can't miss any lectures in. Yeah. No, I know. I'm just... There was a thing. Anyway, thank you. -It's good. -What are you guys doing? Come on. Did you guys hear that? What is that? It was someone talking. Singing maybe. It's weird. I don't know. Holy shit! She dead? I think so. Holy fuck! That's the woman from earlier from the side of the road. -Where's the guy? -What what guy? I, I, her husband. The guy. Do you think he killed her? What? That guy? Who the fuck else? I mean, let's start with, who the fuck comes to a place like this... ...and brings their wife and baby? Holy shit, man. That is creepy. You're right. Plus, we haven't seen anyone else for miles. Guys, where's the baby? Who the fuck cares? Okay? Let's get out of here. I agree. Whoever killed her could still be here. Oh, my God. Let's go, man. Chelsea. -Oh, shit! -Oh, my God! Chelsea! Wait, you know I can't do that to her right now. I'm so sick of hearing that. How long do you expect me to wait around? And you need to stop treating her like she's made of glass, and you need to just break up with her. I can't. Well, I'm tired of Luke. Then maybe you should break up with him. I'm not breaking up with him until you break up with her. -Fine. -Okay. -Done. -Good. Good. And I really hate it when you call her babe. It hurts my feelings. It... You promised that you were... Ryan? Shit! Ryan? Ryan! Ryan, you're kind of scaring me! Can you just... Ryan, stop it! You fucking asshole. -It's not funny! -It was a little funny. It's not actually funny at all. -Like a little funny. -It scared me. Little funny? I have an idea. I think you keep forgetting. That Jade is boring and I'm not. Is that what you think? What the fuck? Seriously? Jade, I'm so sorry. -Luke. -No, fuck you! Alright, fuck the both of you. Just out of curiosity, how long you've been fucking my best friend? Fuck. Jade, I'm sorry. No, I don't want to hear it. We're not safe here, we need to get going. -What? -Right. It's always something, isn't it? Oh, my God! You're still running after her. You're never going to leave her, are you? For once will you stop being such a self-absorbed bitch? I'm the self-absorbed bitch? At least I didn't get knocked up to keep my boyfriend around. What? -Is that what you told her? -Sorry. I'm so sorry. Fuck, no. I don't want to hear it. There is a fucking dead body in here and we need to leave. Luke, where are you going? What the fuck do you care? Wait, Luke! Luke. -Fuck you. Fuck all of you. -Fuck. Okay, what the fuck are you talking about? There's a dead woman, someone Jade saw earlier from the car. Where? What does it matter? I want to see it. For what? -Ryan, we have to call the sheriff. -I want to see it. Luke! Leave me alone! Perfect. Piece of shit phone. What the hell is this? I... -This is where she was. -It is. But she's not here. -Probably wasn't dead then. -Or even here. Right. Yeah. I was, I'm just making this up, like I was making it up when I called you on Chelsea. What the fuck does that have to do with anything? -You cheated and you lied. -Whatever. And the best part is that I haven't been pregnant for two months. I'm such a fucking idiot. Hey, no, you're not. Yep. Where the fuck did she go? I have no idea. This is where we found her. I'm sure of it. Shit. -What? -My phone is dying. Let's go. I saw a bank of switches back that way. Are you okay? Are you alright? Yeah. Nice. That sucked. Oh, no, the lights. Wait. It might be Luke. Luke! Luke! -Do you have your lighter? -Yeah. See if these work. Let's go. Luke! This is bizarre. What is it? It's a straightjacket. This is useless. What the hell is this? Someone definitely lives here. That's weird. Do you guys hear that? That sounds like a nursery rhyme. Yeah. Yeah. I can kind of hear it. Looks like it might be a squatter. Where the hell is Luke? Guys. He's gone. He fucking left. -Hey, babe. Can I talk to you for a sec? -No. -Please just talk to me. -No, I don't have anything to say to you. I'm done. I just want to get out of here and go home. You two deserve each other. Shit. Okay, who's got a light? Our phones are dead. Do you, do you hear that? Who is that? What is that? Luke! Luke, is that you? Oh, shit! Go! Get going! -Oh, my God! -Oh, my God. I wanna get out of here! -The fuck! -Where did it go? Wait. It's impossible. You saw that, right? Okay. Let's get the hell out of here and find Luke. He's probably back at the car. No, I have the keys. -I bet Chelsea's right. -Wait. Stop stop. -I'll go back to the car. -No. No more splitting up. You've got to stop acting like such a fucking hero. -It's unbecoming! -Chelsea, shut up. Guys! Come here. It's Luke's. -That's blood. -Oh, my... I gotta get out of here. -I gotta go! -Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Hey! We're staying. No, no, no. Hey, listen! We're staying together, okay. Let's think. Alright? -Let's think. -Okay, okay. We should go back and check the store. Well, who the hell is in here? I mean, someone's definitely here, right? I think he's at the jeep. Jeep it is. -Let's go. -Oh, wait. I'll stay. No. One of us should be staying here by ourselves. It's okay, I think I can handle a squatter on my own. No offense dude, but do you think you're the best person to stay behind? Maybe I should stay. Me and Luke, we... I fucked up. Big time. If Luke comes back, I should be able to talk to him. I don't want the girls to stay here... ...but I don't want them to go out there alone either. Shaun. Take care of her. What the hell. -Where are the cars? -Gone. Both of them? Maybe Luke? No, I have the keys. That doesn't make any sense. Check the, the store! -Let's check the store. -Okay. Okay. Okay, guys. Okay. We're running? Fine. Yo, Luke! You in here, buddy? The fuck does that say? La sci... La scien. Hey, wait. Oh, come on. It's freezing. Hello? Do you want to check that? Come on! Stupid town, no phones, no gas, no food, no... -Broke in, did you? -You're trespassing. Thank God, it's you. Went to the mine, didn't you? Yeah. I thought at least you were smart. Okay. Well, we lost my... Our friend. He disappeared and we thought that he would be back here, so... -He ain't here. -And he ain't lost. What does that mean? Okay, well, do you want to come help us look for him? Nope. What do you mean no? Where is your other friend? Well, we left him at the mine. Ya should have never gone there. And never go back. Look, we have to go back and to get our friends. Will you please help us? I told you. We ain't ever going in there. Okay, why? What's there? Something happened, didn't it? We found things in there. Things from a hospital or an asylum or something. -There was the asylum. -Blackburn Asylum. It sat right on top of the mine. For the criminally insane. They were the worst of the worst. Steven Nelson. They call him Digits. He killed 12 people with a machete. -Took their fingers. -And their toes. 3 Eyes McMorris. Liked young girls. Kind of like you. After he killed them. How do you know? We taught taxidermy to the inmates. And what about these girls? Who are Poppy and Posey? They were Mary's friends. Mary? Who's Mary? Mary was a beautiful bride. She killed her husbands on their wedding night. But she kept them around. When they caught her, she was six months pregnant. With a room full of dead husbands. She took right to taxidermy. Fleshing was her favorite. But they never let her have sharp objects after... After what? Oh, my God. That's so gross. I'm gonna vomit. Nice party trick. What happened? Mary went into labour. -Baby... -Didn't survive the birth. But she wanted to keep him. What do you mean she wanted to keep him? They had to lock her down. Somehow, she escaped. It was the night she started the fire. She burned it to the ground. They say, people who have been burned are afraid of fire. But not Mary. Where is she now? She's still there. Holy shit! Oh my... Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What's that? Okay, I've got to go back to get Luke and Ryan. Are you stupid? I'm not going back there. No, she's right. We can't leave them there. Does your land line work? Died 10 years ago. Well, does that work? Say again, when do you estimate to begin at the rock slide. -Don't... -Over. We're on-site. -Hey, put this, put... -Still assessing, over. Roger. What's the rough estimate? Over. It's a big job. Might be a day or two to open a lane. -What? -Over. Well, it's okay, we can ah at least call for help. Can I just, can I call for hel... Alright. Well, in the meantime, I'll just go back and get Luke and Ryan. I'll go with you. Chelsea, you can stay here. I'll update the board. -Over. -Okay. Great. We never said she is alone. What do you mean? Central, we need... Go, go, go. Alright, there, go. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, shit. Don't move. Shaun! Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Oh, shit. Duck! Go, go, go! Go, go! The door, the door. Oh, Chelsea. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on, come on, come on! Oh, my God! Let's go, let's go. -Come on. We gotta go. -My ankle! -I just, I want... -We gotta go. -Oh, my God. -It hurts. Come on. Go, go. Go. Go! Wait, wait, wait. You guys, the cars. Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay, go, go. Get under. Wait, get under! Wait, my bracelet. I think we're good. Let's go, we need to go. Let's go, let's go. Come on, Chelsea, we need to go now. -Chelsea... -Help. Come on. You can do it. Come on. Okay, we need to leave. We need to leave. Let's go. Come on, come on. Stop. Okay. Our best chance is to get to the rock slide and fast. There will be people there. No. I'm not leaving without Ryan or Luke. We've got to keep moving to stay warm. They're going to looking for us for a while, but at some point, they're gonna go back to the mine. I'm not sure we should go there. No, that's, that's why we should go back there. That's the last place they'll be looking for us. I don't know. We can not just leave them there. -Come on, come on. -I, I can't make it. They have the baby. Ryan! What's that smell? Smells like formaldehyde. Chelsea. Chelsea, come on. Come on. It's her room full of husbands. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. I don't want to, I just wanna go home. What does that sign say? Abandon hope all ye who enter here. It's Dante. It's Mary. -You shouldn't have come here. -What? Bad idea. -Ryan! -Ryan! Ryan! Jade? Hey. -Hey, hey. -Ryan! What is that? What is that? What is that? -No, no, no. Don't, don't! -Ryan, get out, Ryan, no. Stop! -No! -Ryan! -Stop! Stop! No! -No! Stop! No, don't, no don't! Ryan! Oh, my God! We gotta go, we gotta go. Go, go! We gotta go! We gotta go! Oh, shit! Go! Let's go. The tunnel. Careful. Careful. Guys! Guys, I can't, I can't. -Yeah, you can. Come on! -I can't go anymore. Please don't leave me, okay? -No, no. -Please don't leave me. We're all gonna die. No, we're not. -No, we're not! -Everyone is dead. I'm sorry. -No. It's... -I know I shouldn't have. -And I, I knew it was... -No, no, no, I... Look, we need to keep moving. Alright? Okay, come on. I love you. Come on. Hey. Come on, come on, come. No! No. No. Oh, no. No. Hold her still. -Jade. -No. No. No, no, no. You're so pretty. Your skin's so soft. Not as beautiful as I was though. Hey! No! Holy shit. Holy shit. We'll fix that. You'll be so pretty. -Please... -Hey, hey, no! -No! -What's happening Jade? Stop. I'm gonna make you pretty just like me. Jade! No! You're so beautiful. So pretty. Stop! Go on, get him. You too. Chelsea. Oh, my God! Chelsea. Chelsea. Jade. Ryan was... No! Please, you don't need to do this. It doesn't matter. I thought he loved me. I'm sorry. Chelsea! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Chel, Chelsea. I'm so sorry. Jade, I think we can get out of here. Jade, look at me, we need to get out of here now. I can cut this rope. Come on, come on. Just hang in there. Come on, come on, come on. Come on! It's too late. She's gone. Hey. What? What is it? I can't. No, no they can't come after us. They can't catch us. -We need to keep going. -No, no, no. I can't leave him there. Who? The baby. Fuck, Shaun. When I was missing those classes in March, I was pregnant... ...and I didn't know what to do. In the end, I got pneumonia and I lost the baby. I can't leave that baby there. I have to go back. Look, wait, wait, wait. What if we wait till morning and call someone? You don't have to come with me. But I have to do this. I have to. Okay, listen. You get him and you get out. Alright? -I'll go make some noise. -Okay. Be careful. You too. You're mine now. I'm your mommy now. Mommy. Yeah, so sweet. My baby. My baby. You're mine. My baby's so cute. Monster! Kyle! Kyle. Okay, come on. Come on, come on, come on. No! Shit. Oh, shit. Come on. You gotta be fucking kidding me! Barbecue time, asshole. He's mine! No! No. Jade! No, no! Please, no! No, no! Please, please, stop! We'll be back. Help! Here you go. There you are, sweetheart. I've been looking for you. You like fire so much? Eat this, bitch. Here. Put this on. -You good? -Yeah. Okay. Jade, you good? I'll help you up. Shaun, this is Kyle. Kyle, this is Shaun. Hey, buddy. He used to be my friend, but he's probably never gonna talk to me again. Well, it has crossed my mind. Yeah, I don't doubt it. But then who'd help her in biochem? What do you think happened to Luke? Hope he made it out. We have a surprise for you. Something old. Something blue. Something borrowed. Something new. You shouldn't have come here.
