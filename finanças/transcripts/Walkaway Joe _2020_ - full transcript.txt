There are all sorts of ways to hit a cue ball. The thing you're trying to do is send it in a particular direction, to hit another ball and drop that ball into a pocket, but it's where you send the cue ball next that separates you from the others. When you first start playing, you think it's only about that one ball. You can put backspins, sidespin or topspin on a ball, or you can make it stop on a dime, bounce off a rail. You can hit a ball soft, hard, or just give it a little kiss. You can send a ball behind another ball to make it hard for your opponent to make a shot. Once you have the skills, you can do any of these things. Some dads take their kids to church or to the ball game. That's what some dads do. My dad? He took me to pool halls, and he taught me how to play a game called 9-ball. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Mm! Alright, fellas. I tell you what. We'll put my watch against your $50. It's worth three... five times more than that. Wait, hold on. What are you doing? What do you say? Me and my sentimental, watch-loving son against you two fellows, and I tell you what because we... we are... No, Dad. Dad, come on. That's your grandpa's watch. - Zip it. Zip it. - It costs... Sorry. Why don't you run and get me a pack of cigarettes? That shirt really brings out your eyes. Here is to your grandpa. Nice watch. Nine-ball, succession pool... where you got to knock them down in order. This is truly a sport. It takes skill, and, more importantly... it takes foresight. Ah, come on! I love $50. Nine-ball... sport of kings. What do you say, fellas? Double or nothing? - Yeah, not this time. - I don't think so. Well, thank you so much for your patronage. Could have at least saved me a shot. Well, I tell you what, next game, you shoot first. Now, how about you get us a couple drinks? My treat. Hey, kiddo, I didn't realize how late it was. Your mom is gonna have my hide. Let's skedaddle. Come on, let's just stay a little bit longer? I'll let you drive. Awesome. Chip? Yeah. Ah, damn it, go! Go, Dallas! Aah! Jesus, easy, boy! Dallas, I ain't telling you again. Get up. You're not staying home from school, so you get that out of your head right now. Hey, I need your help cleaning out the shed after dinner. - Can't. - Is that so? Dad has got a game with some guys from Kentwood. - Forget it. - He wants me there. Dad, tell her what the deal is tonight. You're not going, and that's the end of it. We'll see. Yeah, we will see, won't we? Did you even hear that? Hey! That's trouble, you know. You never help me discipline him. He is barely squeaking by in school! He's fine. By your standards, maybe. Did it ever occur to you to be his parent instead of his playmate? Just one cup of coffee. He's doing fine. What do you mean by that? Well, what I mean is he's doing fine, Gina. I thought you'd had enough of this shit when you was a kid. Damn it, Gina, don't. I know the road you're going down. Don't do it. Shit! I'm gonna be late again. We need to talk. I mean it. I'm not worried, Gina. I can't just leave work like that every time you cause a problem at school. I'm gonna lose my job over your little stunts! Oh, God. Mom? Mom, let me see. - Dallas. - Mom, let me see! Dallas! Honey... You know how your daddy can get! Your daddy around? No. - He say when he'll be back? - No. Well, why don't that surprise me? Well, tell him Earl stopped by. He'll know why. I always thought I was gonna have a big life... nice house, two cars, three kids. Just like on the TV. - This is it. - Let's face it. He hasn't been good to you in forever. Only part of my dream that come true is Dallas. You know how you know when it's over, Sandy? They stop kissing you. Better no man than a worthless one. Who you calling worthless, Sandy? Dallas. I see the way you flirt with him. Oh, please. And you... you... you wonder why he takes off! You're bad-mouthing him all the time. That is not fair! It's true. You drove him away! Go to your room. Go! I don't want to hear another word out of you, go! Get! Well, look at what the cat drug in. She's a beaut. Yeah. You seen Cal around, Jackie? Earlier. You two aren't together? Can I get a drink? So if you're not with your dad, how'd you get here anyway? Yo, Dallas! You're up. Coming. Be right back. Good because I'm not done with you yet. Wait, you're Dallas? Last time I checked, and, uh, you must be Wayne. No, kid. No, this isn't Toys "R" Us. We're playing for money here. Nine-ball, it's the bottom of the break. Call your last shot. Let's rack them. Oh. Believe you just lost all that paper-route money, kid. Oh! I... I do believe this is what they call "ball in hand." so, uh, let's see. If I were a cue ball, where would I want to be? I don't know, Wayne. What do you think? Because, you know, I got a lot of different options here. You know, I could take a shot on that side pocket right there. Maybe I could spice some things up and try and do a bank. Ooh! I'm not gonna feel so bad about whooping your narrow hide. Well, uh, you want to make it $40, so you can take me a real good lesson? Done. Oh, my, the heat is on. Ahh. Excuse me. Nine-ball, one rail, corner back here. Never happen. - Oh! - Oh! Never is a long time. Afraid not. You didn't call a pocket. Yes, I did. I... I pointed to the... He didn't call it, did he, Seth? Anybody else hear him call it? Seems like we all on the same page. You're a dick. You know what I said. Bar ain't no place for a kid, nohow. The boy called it right. This old man talking to me? Uh, no disrespect, but I did hear him. I don't see how this is any of your concern. Well, you asked everyone, and I believe I qualify. Consider yourself disqualified. Is that right? This boy beat you fair and square. Hey, boy, that's enough. Jackie's right. - Ooh! - Ooh! Come on, get back. Mnh-mnh. Take your money, son. Oh, damn it. What was that? Why don't you just mind your own business? Yeah, okay. Uh, listen, why don't you just tell me you live within a reasonable distance, and I'll take you home to your mama? I don't have a mama. I... I mean... I mean, she died. So who... who do you stay with then, boy? My dad, but, uh, you know, he... he had to go somewhere. You know, he left me with a buddy of his. You know, he didn't realize what a drunk the guy was. You know, he... he beat the crap out of me earlier. Can't go back there, or he'll kill me. Uh, is there anywhere I can take you, or anyone I can drop you off with? Or wh-what about a neighbor or a... My dad is at a pool hall called Fatty's in Baton Rouge. You know, if you could just, you know, drop me off there, everything would be cool. You know, my dad is actually a professional pool player. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, big time. So wh-what's happening? Is he on a circuit or something? - Yeah, sort of. - Hmm. Well, what you do mean "sort of" or something? I don't know. He just, you know, plays around. Yeah. Yeah, so basically he just plays in bars for money, right? Well, n-not just bars, you know, tournaments, too. He's actually making a real big name for himself. Yeah, I mean, you know, people actually compare him to Willie Mosconi. Ah, is that right now? Heh, Willie Mosconi? You'll see when you meet him. This is your last warning. Get up. Dallas? Dallas? What time is it? About 7:30. Come here. Lie down here. Go lie down. You know, uh, you should show me some moves. - I-I don't think so. - Why not? I'm-a let you answer that question. How far away from Baton Rouge? It's down the road that way. Okay. Later. - Hey, wait, hold on! - That's okay. Wouldn't want to end up on Amber Alert. You still might, smart-ass. Okay, fine. Suit yourself. - I will! - Have a nice walk. I can't tell you how sorry I am about your father. Well, thank you for taking care of everything, Merle. You bet, Joe. He'd have done the same thing for me. Mm. Now, what are my chances on talking you into joining the 21st century and buying a cellphone? No, I'm... I could have called you a week ago. Well, I'm just not gonna put a microwave up against my ears. It's not gonna happen. I'd settle for a mailing address. Mm. Well, as executor of your father's estate, and I use that term loosely, I need your signature on a couple of things to finalize his will. His years in assisted living pretty much took care of any assets he had left, but there were a few items he wanted you to have. That's 9 grand the IRS didn't know about. Well, he never did cease to amaze me how he could turn a nickel into $5. Gave me his Winchester rifle. Said it wouldn't fit in the box. I'll give you a minute. There is something else, Joe. The nursing home forwarded his mail to me. Didn't know what you wanted me to do with this. It's from Christopher. It's addressed to your father, but I think it's meant for you. So, uh, you're not, like, on vacation or anything? You actually live in here? That's right. Who are they? Uh, sit back and mind your own business before you make me have an accident. Oh, I'm just messing. I got you. Well, where are they? Well, what have we here? We stopping? Yeah, I got to make a living. Hurry up. It's hot in here. Well, it was a lot hotter on that road, wasn't it? Could have walked there faster. - What seems to be the problem? - How you doing? Are you with, uh, roadside assistance? Uh, no. No, I'm not. I just kind of do freelance. I might be able to get you on the road a lot sooner. Okay, good, good. Well, how much do you, uh, you cost? Well, I can guarantee you I charge a lot less than... Um, we were, like, a couple miles down, and it started, uh... Alright. Cut the act, slick. I know you're not sleeping. I was trying to. Is everything in there? Yeah, you know, of... of course. I didn't take nothing, you know. Just dropped my pencil. Oh, yeah, where's your pencil? You know what would make more money? Yeah, I saw you work your marks in the pool hall, remember? He was trying to get over on me first. Oh, and that's all that matters, right? - Cal teaches me plenty. - Yeah, it shows. Come on. You're not staying in here. Hey. Here. Stop scribbling on all my crap. Why we stopping? Now, you just stay put. I don't want you going anywhere. If the air works. Why wouldn't it? Now, don't touch anything. If you do, I'm gonna break one of your skinny fingers. Joe. What in the name of God are you doing here? You've, uh, you've kept the place looking real nice, Maggie. - Law says you can't be here. - I know. I know, I... I, uh, you know, I don't want any trouble. I just, um, I just wanted to tell Christopher that his granddaddy passed away. I'm sorry about that. I'll let him know. And would you give this to him, please? Chris isn't here. - Yes, I know he's moved on! - Yes. Who's there, Maggie? Nobody. I'll be right in. Mm. You just stay away from him. It's the least you could do. Why'd the woman snub you like that? I mean, personally, I... I think it's kind of whacked. Why can't you give your kid a gift? You know the nice thing about a personal life? - It's personal. - Hey, man, I'm on your side. There are no sides. Hmm, didn't like your breakfast, honey? Well, uh, he's having some lady problems. Lost his appetite. Everything was fine. Just the check, please. Hey, uh, you know, I think I figured out the problem with your kid. Yeah, well, I don't remember asking. Just show up to the wedding and give him the money in person. I mean, she can't stop you then, right? It's more complicated than that. Then, stop complicating it. What day is it? Sunday? Well, you know I saw the invitation. We're still going to Fatty's, right? Hell, if he ain't pissing people off, he's ripping them off. You know them chains and watches he sells ain't real? You know, I'm glad you won't let him play in here. He's more trouble than he's worth. - This place is skanky anyway. - Okay, enough. Well, the apple don't fall too far from the tree, does it? I can't imagine why your daddy ain't home. - Fuck you, fat man. - Okay. You know, it might be in your best interest to keep your mouth shut once in a while. You know, Cal's talented, and that makes people jealous. Yeah, he may be talented, but the truth of the matter is that your dad... What would you know about my dad? You live in a camper with a dog. And what does that make me? Someone whose own family don't want him around. You're Cal McCarthy's kid, right? Yeah, yeah. You were at the house, right? Uh-huh. - Where is he? - I don't know. Come look for him with us? Dallas, we should probably be going. Hold on, cowboy. The three of us are talking. I don't want to go anywhere with you. Hey, hear that? The boy don't want to go. Maybe you would like to stay and hang out with us for a spell. Do you know, your daddy and me, we go way back. Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but, uh, the boy is in my charge, so if you don't mind. Oh, we mind. Might be best if you hop back in your time machine and made yourself scarce. That's just not gonna happen. That's not a request. You know what? I... I changed my mind. - I'm... I'm gonna go. - No, kid. You want my advice? Save yourself a little bit of pain and suffering and walk away. Alright, old man. Dallas, you get in the RV right now. Come on. Aah! God. It's a good thing you aren't gonna live long enough to reproduce. Oh, what? A cat's got your tongue now? Okay, that was stupid. No, that was 85 miles past stupid. Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay? Can you just get off my back? I got a better idea. I'm gonna get you off my back. Stay, girl! - Where we going? - We're not going anywhere. You're going home. You're gonna call someone to come get you. - I already told you. - I don't care. - Call anyone. - What? I'm not your fricking problem, okay? Just leave me alone. You don't understand. I know where he's headed. Look, listen, there's a poster back at Fatty's, okay? There's a big pool tournament this weekend in New Orleans, and he's gonna be there. That couldn't matter less to me. Either you start dialing or I'm gonna call a cop. This is your choice. You know what? Fine. Go ahead. Then I'll never see him again. I fricking lied, okay? He's not coming back for me. You coming?! I screwed up on the hands a bit. Well, that's not half bad. I think you ought to do something with that. - With what? - That. You mean like a job or something? Yeah, like a job or something. Who's gonna pay me to do this? A lot of people. Kind of just figured I would play pool. Yeah, well, I'm sure Cal will be proud of you no matter what you do. Alright. Come on, Story, go get it. Bring it here. You're the first person she's let throw a ball besides me. Really? Yeah, she must have guessed you had a good arm. My dad taught me. He was a pitcher in high school. Is that right? You know, um, I actually played for a bit. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, my mom worked a lot and my dad couldn't always get me to practice, so had to quit. Had to quit. Well, we couldn't get enough of baseball in our house. Yeah, we... we ate it. We drank it. We slept with it. Whenever there was a game on, we'd go out on the porch and listen to the play-by-play on the radio, ask each other about players' stats, you know, and all. We could not stump my youngest. What's his name? You got any favorite memories? I mean, I don't know. I got lots of them. Any one of them stick out in your mind? Well, this one time when I was about 7 or something, I remember my dad bought this really bitching Triumph motorcycle, and we took a ride out to the country, to one of his buddies' houses. You know, a whole bunch of guys hanging out. They didn't mind me. They even let me play a few hands of cards with them. I remember when it came time to leave, my dad sat me in front of him and wrapped me up in his big old leather jacket. I still remember what it smelled like. Pretty stupid, huh? No, no. That's... that's not stupid at all. You know, my dad's not a bad person. Yeah, well, I'm not here to judge. Ugh. Do you know you have a taillight out? Uh, yes, I do. I do apologize. License, registration, proof of insurance. Okay, Houdini, you can come out now. This might be the time for you to come clean. Not really. Well, let me rephrase that then. This is the time that you are gonna come clean. Okay, fine, I'll tell you when she leaves. No, you're gonna tell me now or you're gonna be leaving with her. Okay, okay. Fine, fine. This cop might be looking for me. For any particular reason? Because my mom has probably got half of Louisiana out hunting for me by now. Hmm, and that would be your dead mom? You wouldn't have helped me find him if I told you the truth. She know where you are and what you are doing? No. So you gonna turn me in? I don't know yet. The day's not over. I know there's one thing you're gonna do for me. - Hello? - Mom? Dallas. What are you doing, baby? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm with a friend. What friend? Doesn't matter. He's taking me to Dad. No, no. Tell me where you are. - I'll come get you. - Not yet. - Mom, I'm gonna bring him back. - What? - I'm gonna bring Dad home. - What? Dally, honey, this ain't got nothing to do with you, okay? I'll be home in a day or two. A day... Don't do this to me. Dallas, please, don't. - Dallas. - I... I got to go. Dallas. You feel better now? It's overrated. What are these for? You earned those. You did right by your mama. Besides, you don't want to smell like old cheese when you meet with your father. Oh, Ricky. Did you hear that? I think that is the sound of you going to the poor house. I bet you're gonna go there before I do. Oh, shit. That's alright. I'm gonna be over here with my little private cheering section while you clear the table for me. Hey, Dad. Miss me? Dallas, what are you doing here? Came to find you. Uh, is your mama here? No, and good thing she ain't. She the reason you left? No, hell, no. I'm not an idiot. No, no, some fellow is bothering her, so, you know, I was just pretending to be her boyfriend is all. Don't bust my balls. That's all it was? 'Course that's all it was. Then why did you leave? Well, Dallas, you know, it... Hey, how did you get here anyway? My friend Joe Haley gave me a ride. That so? Joe Haley. Hey, Dallas, why don't you, uh, why don't you go get us a couple of drinks? Okay. Want anything? Nope, no, thanks. I suppose you know what's going through my head right now, so why don't you tell me how a grown man knows my 14-year-old boy? He was on the side of the road. His bike had broke down, and I just offered him a ride. He said he was looking for his dad. Well, you found me. Where you from? Uh, mostly here. Yourself? Here and there, I guess. Mm. You guess, yeah. What do you mean by that? Uh, nothing. No, really, not... nothing at all. You know, Joe, uh, there ain't no road map to being a daddy, you know? We just do the best we can. Yeah, you got that right. Thank you, boy. Well, it was nice talking to you. - Yeah. - Um, I-I'm gonna go. Come on, Joe. Come on. You don't want to hang for a little? No. Hey, Joe. I just... I wanted to say thank you. Uh, you bet. I'll put your backpack and your bike in your daddy's truck. Okay. Oh, hey, and Joe, don't worry about the wedding. Your buddy is leaving, huh? Yeah. I'm sorry about that. How about we do what we do and get down to some serious matters, okay? We've got some fish to fry. Alright, folks. I've got 50 bucks says this boy can beat anybody in this room. $20, $40, $60, $80, $81. Easy money, huh? That sure as hell beats 9-5, barely alive. Why do you do it? Why do I do it? It's in my blood, just like it was in your grandpa Gus' and just like it's in yours. You're making me lose count here. Alright. Why you so moody? Look, you just made some money. Can we just go home now? Dallas, tournament is tomorrow. I didn't come all this way not to play. Fine, after the tournament. We'll talk about it later. No, why can't we talk about it now? Stop riding me, boy. Okay. Why don't you take this, go get us a couple of sodas? I'm gonna take a shower. Afterwards, we'll go grab a burger. Does that sound alright? Dallas. You okay? It's okay. It's alright. I know these guys. Cal, why did you make us chase you halfway across the state? It's $1,000. $1,000. Take it. You're five short, son of a bitch. No! Please don't hurt him. Don't do it. Dad. What are you doing? No, wait, please. How am I supposed to pay you back if I can't play? No, wait, please. I... I... I know where we can get the money. Dad, just promise me you'll come home? Okay. There's a dog. Just get the box. I'll distract it. Just get the box. Go. Hey. Hey. Shh. - Get out of here! - Oh! Ah! Get the money. Hey, kiddo. Are you okay? I just want to go home. Yeah. I'm sorry about your friend. You know, to be honest with you, I sometimes forget you're just 14. I know you want to go home, and I don't want you to worry, so first thing in the morning, we're gonna put you on a bus. Okay? But you said you were coming with me. I'm not, Dallas. You promised. I know. I know I did. Listen... I am not good... As a matter of fact, I am horrible at playing pretend, and I've been doing it too long, and it's not fair to your mama, and it's certainly not fair to you. The fact of the matter is I... I can't do it anymore. But... Just hear me out, please. See, me, I am who I am. And I'm gonna have to live with that forever, but that does not mean that I have to put you through it, too. I mean, look at us, Dallas. I'm supposed to be your daddy, and you're the one that's taking care of me. Look, the best thing I can do for everyone is to not go back. But mom needs you. No. No, your mama doesn't need me. The only one mama needs is you. You lie. - You lie about everything. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'm not lying about this, and some day you're going to realize very soon that I was really never there. - Get out of here, kid. - Joe, I... - You're a little prick. - I... What, what, what? You're sorry, right? I didn't have a choice. You always have a choice. They were gonna cut off my dad's finger. Well, none of that matters anymore. Joe, wh-what can I do? I'll do anything. You can leave. Come on, girl. You got to eat. Come on, Story. Can I help you? I want to sign up. Dallas? I'm not here for you. I'm here to beat you. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the one and only Lacy's Cue 9-Ball Open. Alright. Let's hear it. Let's get this party started. Somebody should have warned me. Tell you what, you're impressing me today. I did notice you were a little tight on the breaks, maybe just loosen up that backstroke a little bit. Or just do it your own way. Dallas McCarthy. I tell you, folks, this boy is only 14 years old. I don't know for sure, but I think we could be making some history here tonight. Let's hear it for all the players we've had in this tournament. You've got to be kidding me. Is this kid not something, people? This is one of the best tournaments I think we've ever had. You all give me a little space here. Come over here, boy. How you feeling? - Okay. - Okay? Son, you're about to be playing your daddy in the finals of a winner-take-all pro-am qualifying tournament and the best you can tell me is you feel okay? Oh, hell, he's just a little bit nervous is all. He's never beaten me more than a game in a row in his whole life. Oh, let's hear it for our two finalists. Now let's shoot some 9-ball. Make it good, Dally, might be the only shot you get. There's your one. Ball in hand. That was your first mistake. May as well start unscrewing that thing now. Let's rack them. I think that makes us even. You know, I'm gonna be flat-out honest with you here, Dallas. I do believe that your chances are dwindling. Oh, talk about keeping it in the family. Let's hear it for these McCarthy boys. Looks like I may shoot again. That was beyond impressive, Dallas. Hey, Cal, can you come over here a minute? Cal, you proud of your boy? I am always proud of my boy. Spoken like a real papa. No, it's... it's all right. Hell, I deserve it. Dallas, no matter how much you hate me, I am so proud of you. I will always love you. You need to know that. In three seconds, I'm calling security. Where did you get that? From the 9-ball tournament. Just wanted to give it to you. That's all. Hold on. I believe you still owe me one favor. Joe? Joe? Joe. Hi. Just let... let me rest. Sorry. Just rest. I'll talk to you later. It's okay. Just... Just rest. Damn it! Give me those damn keys. Now! You could have killed the both of us. Relax. I drive my dad's truck all the time. You had no right. Figured I was doing you a favor. Yeah, well, you figured wrong. Now give me those damn keys. Get dressed. You're gonna be late. You look good. Know what you're gonna say? Don't worry. It's gonna be great. Oh, no, no, no. You're coming, too. You got me into this. Come on. You want to get closer? No, I'm fine. Okay. Here you go. No, I... I got this. Just take care of the guests. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here, Joe? I already know about grandpa. I just wanted to congratulate you... in person. This is a big day. Yeah, just surprising. It's been a while, you know? Chris, you have every right to be angry about a lot of things. I just wanted you to know that I'm a different person now. Yeah? You don't look that different. Still fighting those demons? Some of them. Um, I want you to have this money, just to help you get started. We're fine. I know it hurts, Chris. Yes. Yes, it does. 17 years' worth. It hurts me, too. What do you want from me, Joe? I... I... I just... Nothing more than to tell you how sorry I am, okay, and that I... hope some day you could come to forgive me. I don't know. You had two sons. You cared more about losing Danny than you did about saving me. Excuse me, but I'm going to go do this right. Mom. I shouldn't have brought you here. It's alright. Don't worry about it. What was that about? I blinked. I, uh, I took my eyes off the prize. After one of Danny's Little League games, he and I went out with some of his teammates and their parents for drinks and whatnot. I think Christopher was... Well, he had a cold, and he had stayed home with his mother that day. And we were already late. I don't know why I... I thought I could beat the light. My judgment was impaired. I didn't realize that Danny wasn't... ...that Danny wasn't buckled in. Dallas, there's some things in your life you just can't run away from. So, uh, let's get you home. It's over there. It's gonna be weird without my dad around. Dallas, you know, whether he comes back or even if he doesn't, that's something you can't control, and you can't let it derail your own life, you know? It's... it's time for you to get on with your own life however best you can. Uh, could I see that drawing you did of me earlier? - Sign it. - Why? Because I want it. Okay. Off you go. Think God ever makes mistakes when he assigns children to their parents? I don't know. He should have put us together. He did, son. He did.
