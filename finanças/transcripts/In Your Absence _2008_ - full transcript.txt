I've thought a lot about you, Pablo. I know you don't believe it, but... Too much I should say. How old were you?.. Eleven? Thirteen. What happened back then... Well, it just happened... ...I can't complain, can I? I was lucky. ...Very lucky. IN YOUR ABSENCE Not that one son, it's new. Get another. Pablo, eat. I'm not hungry. I've already eaten. Oh yes? And where? In the fields. In the fields? A mushroom. A mushroom... Drink your milk. Don't want to. Who was that man who was here this morning? And what's it to you? Don't try controlling my life. I am quite mature enough, and know how to care for myself. Drink your milk. He came to ask about the field. And to buy the house. Well, he's not to come again. Pablo... You haven't used your dad's shotgun again, have you? No. Don't. You'll only ruin it. Hi Julia. Drink your milk. So, you've eaten? Go for a walk? Ok, wait a moment. How's your Grand-dad? He's still there,... at home. Pablo, the milk! Shut up Cookie! That dog doesn't care what I say... Nobody cares what you say, Pablo. Hey, no one hits me! First get rid of that fuzz on your lip, then you can hit me. With that silly little moustache of yours... Are you growing little titties? Hey, what about all that stuff about the social services? How's it going? It's fucking bullshit. Those lunatics think they're gonna take me away... Seriously, they want to take you away? The postman says he's got a friend who's gonna help me... - ...so they don't come looking for me... - I don't think they'll bother... But I've got it all worked out: if it's a chick who comes, I'll do this... I'll kick her so hard in the cunt... ...she'll have her periods for atleast three years. And if it's a guy? Yeah well, if it's a guy... I'll shove his face in my tits... And I'll drag him back there, back where he works. Then me, I'll walk back. You're a freak. Freak yourself, monkey-face! Look Julia, cool eh? Yeah, really beautiful. You should see what is overthere... Overthere? Overthere at the end, in the corner. Bloody hell! That's so cool! Julia, come, come here sis. It's kind of disgusting. Poorthing's got flies. Gross but kinda cool, no? Gross. I don't no how you can like that kind of thing. You're just a freak. Freak yourself. Cookie! Cookie... stupid dog! Let's go. I'm sorry. Come here, cookie... It's called Cookie? Yes. And that's a male or female name? It's a she. It sounds nice. - Sounds nice? - Yeah. And does it taste great as well? My dad said it sounds good. Come on, let's go. I think she's angry at you. Did you do anything to her? Yeah, we had a fight before, 'cause she's nuts. Don't fight with a thing so beautiful, by God... She starts running like that for no reason, and it frightens me. Surely not. Besides, don't kids and animals always get on well? Yeah, but we still fight sometimes... I get on great with both animals and children. What's your name? Pablo. Come on, let's go Cookie... You live around here? Yes. Isn't it kind of lonely? Yeah. You have no other friends around? You like walking alone like this? Come on Cookie, we're going. Come with me. She seems to be happy with me. Yeah, but I have to go... Sit down. You know what you're thinking right now? You're thinking: 'This guy, why's he not leaving?.. ...He's sticking around, touching my dog... ' Well. Nice to meet you Pablo. Pablo, wait, come here! Get into the car and start it up, ok? Get in, and start it up when I say ok? Ok, now! Let's see, let me try it... Are you going to live there all your life? Come on, come here and sit down a while. It'll all work out. Yeah? Why? Ah, well my dad told me that cars are like people: ...if they're breathing, they're still alive. Your dad knows something about mechanics? I once saw him fix a tractor with some chewing gum. And you can bring him here? Where's your dog? I guess she went back home. It's my second dog. Your second? And the first? Look dad, look what I found. Pablo, not now, boy... - But look, look how cute he is. - I'm busy now, kid. Can I keep it? - Where did you pick that one up from? - In the fields, he was alone... Please. Mum, tell him I can keep it. Ok Pablo, you're almost a man now. But now... the dog is YOUR responsibility, If anything happens,... you'll have to get rid of it Ok, so I can keep it right? Do you agree? Ok. Thanks! Hello. - Hello, how goes it? - Good afternoon. - I'm the local postman. - Pleased to meet you. - I saw you over here. Are you going to the village? - Just passing through. Just going through, ok. Hi Pablo! - You come from faraway? - Yes, quite a way. The north. Ah the North, shit, yeah, lovely place... very good... - ...Santander, San Sebastian?.. - In that direction, yes. - So you're heading for the village? - Just passing through. I saw you stopped here, I was on a my way to do the rounds... ...and saw you broken down here. I just thought you might have difficulties. No, it's just that for now the car won't start. But well, no worries, it's still breathing, right Pablo? We have just one mechanic, if you want... Not to worry, in half an hour this will just... - Are you sure? - Yes, it's done this before. - This is not the first time then? - No, it's not the first time. Do you mind, if I just take a look? Seems it wants to go, but just isn't getting there... Maybe it's just overheating. - Perhaps yes, just that. - Long trip was it? Yes, it was a long trip. If you've been going the whole day, it probably just needs a rest. Yes, as I said, within half an hour,... So, what d'you think? Yep, a beauty hey... You lot also have a beautiful countryside... Yes, but the light is different, colours and... - I know Santader. - Oh good. - So you're from there? - No, no... - Nearby then? - Yes, quite close. Very good. I'm delighted. It's great, not many people pass through here, shit... it's great. Well, anyhow, I guess I'll get back to my rounds. Great. No really, no need, thanks anyway. A pleasure. See you next time... - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Pablo, You've got a letter! Come here. Hey, do you know him from somewhere? No? - How long have you been there with him? - A little while. Has he told you where he's from? Nothing? Well go home now, don't stick around with him. - Who's writing to you? - It's for my mom. So what then... you'll show me the way, or should I call a taxi? - Where to? - The village. Find a mechanic, a garage... - Do you know where it is? - No, yeah, I mean... it's been a while since... Let's go together then, ok? You don't mind joining then? So, you're Pablo Well, I'm Francisco - Yeah. - What d'you mean 'yeah'? - Hello. - Hello. - And who's that? - Probably his father. His father? Dickhead! Why don't you think a bit! And why not? Poor thing. It's normal for him to be like that, after what happened... - How long since he's come here? - Bloody ages. Good-day. And the last time you serviced the car? About... one year ago I think. Oil change recently? Change of oil? Eh, mechanics, I don't understand much about it. Oh, you're not familiar with it then... I've been a mechanic a long time, and well, this is... Doesn't look good, does it? No, not at all. Well, in any case, let's do one thing... You leave it with me a couple of days, and I'll check it in my garage. Oh dear... so it means I'll have to stay?.. - And that's a little problem for you? - Are there any hotels in the village? - Hotel? Hotel no, there's a bar in the town centre. - And they rent out rooms? - Yes, it's not bad at all. - Ok then, well I'll go and take a look In any case, first I'd like to find a friend I'm looking for. Tell me. You might know him. His name is Pablo Benitez. Pablo Benitez?.. Yes, Pablo Benitez, we were in the army together... Yeah sure, but... you're joking a little aren't you? No, it's been years since we've seen each other. I think he lives in this district... I don't know if this is the village or... Well, the one who could inform you best is... Pablo. Christ! You're Pablo's Benitez's son? I could have spent years looking for him, and I fall on his son... amazing... How's your father? Good. Ok, I'll be off. The tow truck will take it away. Come over later. Ok. Many thanks. Pablo's Benitez's son... incredible. Well, then take me to him! Let's go. I knew he lived around here, I vaguely remember the village name... ...but I didn't have an address or anything. What does he do? He always dreamt of having his own bar. Setup his own business, be his own boss. You look a lotlike him. You're very handsome. Hey, looks like it's gonna rain, no? How did it happen? He fell. How? He was in the hospital for three weeks. Were you close to him? Your father... ...truth is we had a ball... You know, everyone knows in the army you make good friends. But with your dad it was something really special. And what did you do? Oh, imagine! The manoeuvres, out in the sticks... We shared our tent. We always shared the same tent. You went to war? No, dear, no, it had been a while since the war had ended. He was such a laugh. Well, if he had to be serious, he was! Disciplined, severe, most of all with himself... The best. But a friend like few have them. Tell me more, tell me more about how he was. Tell you more? It's been so many years now. Because when the service was over, we lost contact... ...I don't know. My dad,.. he was great... ...he taught me how to use the shotgun and all that. I remember one time, I forgot to turn on the warming lights... ...for the chicks, in winter... ...that heats them... ...and in the morning they were all dead. I'm a bit of a scatterbrain... One thing I had to do, and I couldn't do it. Well, I'm sure he understood, no? Yeah. God Damn! One bloody thing the kid has to do and he can't! Look. Sit down there. Pluck it. ...And all the others as well. Put the feathers in the pillowcase. And sleep with it. It was to make me more responsible. Since then, I'm not so scatterbrained anymore. Crazy weather you have here in the mountains. Anyhow, we always talk well of the dead, right Pablo? I mean, he also had his other side no? Because your dad, sometimes... - ... he had his moments, right? - No. I mean sometimes, when he lost his temper he'd be... No, my dad was good. He would go slightly overboard, I saw him, mother of God... No. My father was good! Yes, he was a good man. Yes. We all have secrets Pablo. I have a theory. Men are like oysters, closed to suffering. We all have a pearl inside, and let no one see it. What is yours? - Hello, good afternoon. - Hello, and good afternoon! Sorry for the bother. They tell me you rent out rooms. - Yes, sir. - Well of course, for you? - Yes, please. - For you alone? - Yes, just me. For long? Well, to start with, just tonight. I don't know, I'm just passing through. Of course. So you don't know how long you'll be here for? No. It's just that the car broke down, and it's with the mechanic. - The time he needs to fix it... - Do you know anyone from the village? No, I don't know anyone in the region. Could I see the room then? Well of course, by all means! At once! Jesus the key! Where have you put it? Jesus the key! The key was here this morning... You sure it didn't fall? No! Where have you put it? You're always doing this. - Don't do this to me Jesus! - Speak to God and he shall answer you! Ah, give it to me. Forgive me a second... These kids... Jesus, you're pushing me too far! We'll go and see it? I'll go, you're very busy here. Don't worry. If it's easy to find... Yes, up the stairs first room there. See you in a bit. What do you want? Acola. An orange soda then. The list Jesus, I told you that you should have done it last night! - Yes, ok, it'll do for tonight. - Could you serve us a couple of fizzy drinks? - Absolutely, right now. To have here? - We can sit there? - Of course, why on earth not? - Thanks. You'll be thirsty after that walk, won't you? Do You have a girlfriend Pablo? Me? No. There's a girl who's got eyes on you... - Ah that's Julia. - A friend of yours? - Very friendly or... just friends? - No, we've known each other for ages. She has no parents. They're both dead. Anything else you'd like? We are here for anything you might wish. She lives with her grandfather. - Yeah, but the granddad's nuts. - Nuts? - He ate earth from his fields. - You have to be nuts to eat earth from the fields... No, no. He's nuts BECAUSE he ate earth. Well, what do you know! What's up? Great to see you again. Do you mind? So, how's the car thing coming along? The mechanic is onto it now. Very good. Hey, I've got a cousin who's a local policeman from Ubrique... ...if you need anything, or the mechanic needs anything from there... ...just let me know. I'm very happy to help. Many thanks. No, I think the mechanic has it under control. - Very good. How old is your car? - The car might be... four or five years old maybe. Four or five years, and already with these types of problems?.. It was a very long journey. Truth is I understand nothing of cars. Yeah well, a little odd. But well, if you say so... Well, I'm off. Glad to have seen you again. Have a good time, bye! Hi Julia, what's up? Looking great. What brings you here? Did you speak with the social worker? Yes, I spoke with this colleague of mine, and he says there won't be any problem. He'll lend us a hand to sort that little thing out. - I can trust you on this one? - You can trust me no problem. What brings you here, looking so good? Hey, I'd like the three of us, me, you and your granddad... ...to see each other in your house tomorrow, to sort things out about this. Is that ok? In my house, why, if my granddad doesn't even know where he is? Don't worry about that. The ones who need to understand each other are you and me. Sound good? See you tomorrow? Yes or no? Ok, well then, tomorrow, I'll be over in the morning. See you then. The postman left his hat here, I'll take it to him... Thanks. Hey, what are you doing there? I'm with Paco. Yes, I can see that. I told you the first time: he's tricking you. He's lying. He said the car was his, and is five years old. But the car is rented and is only two years old, I found out. Don't you find it odd that he's lying to you? That he lies to me ok, but lying to you? Be very careful. What you need to do is go home now. You know he left that hat there on purpose, right? He wanted to tell you something about me, no doubt. No, no. Come on Pablo, you can tell me... Well,... he said... ...he said that the car, that... ...that you came with, is rented. Of course. It's true it's rented. I always rent the same car from a friend of mine... ...and it's like it was my own. You know something Pablo. If I had a son, I would love for him to be like you. Truly. Let's go? I'll be back later then. I could swear I have seen this man before. I've got a nasty feeling about this guy. What did you do today? Nothing. Where did you go? The fields. With who? With no one. With no one? And what about the car that almost killed the dog? Look at me. What? The postman told me. I'm very worried Pablo. Very worried, son. Do you want some sugar? I don't want milk. Have you finished? Yes, thanks. I can take everything away? Everything was as you want it? Yes, very good, thanks. You know something... ...the more I look at you, the more your face rings a bell. I don't know. It's the first time I've been around here. No, no, overhere no. I've seen you in another place. Your face rings a bell. I could swear I saw you in another place. I don't know, seems unlikely. Or maybe you are confusing me with someone else. No, no, I'm not confused, a face like yours isn't hard to remember. No, not a chance, ... what was I going to say... you'll be staying here a while longer? Well, as I said, I don't know, it depends on the mechanic... - ...who's sorting out the car. - It's still not fixed then? I'm just going to check. You don't come from one of those coastal towns do you? - No, I come from the north. - Ah the north. Which part of the north? The north. You realise Jesus? Do you realise? That guy's been to jail. I'm positive now. And you know something else? I've seen him in Jerez. And he thinks I know nothing! What d'you know? More than you imagine, more than you can imagine. - I don't believe it. - What?.. what? I don't believe it. Come on then, say what you know. Why should I tell you what I know? I'm no gossip. I don't go spreading things everywhere. But I know it all! Good day. Hello. Hi, how are you? Careful with the hands. And you later on, what do you want to be? I really like animals. Animals? Horses?.. Have you been to any big towns, like Madrid, Barcelona? No. - The furthest I've been is to Granada. - And that's the furthest you've been? A school trip. And you liked it? What did you see? And where did you stay, in a Hotel in Sierra Nevada, or?.. - No, more like a hostel thing. - A hostel? Yes. The kind with dormitories, big ones... Where you going man? With that lovely white shirt, and 'I-look-so-super' side-parting. - Fora walk. - Yeah. A walk. Been spending a lot of time with that guy? That's normal, handsome as you are... ...he's got a crush on you. What an idiot,Julia. Well, I'm off now. What..., should we meet later at the hideout? Ok, when? Just to hang out. I've got some thing for you. Ok. Bye. Do you know what you want to be later? - A lawyer. - A lawyer? Dear God. That would have come in handy, some years back. What do you do? I have an antique shop, I buy, sell things. I know a poem. Oh yeah? Which? 'Like You Were Absent' You'll recite it to me, or should I guess? ...'I like it when you are quiet because it is as though you were absent... ' 'It seems that my voice touches you... ' 'But... 'But... It... doesn't touch you' ...eh, 'it seems'... no,... 'The eves'... Wait. ' I Like it when you are quiet because it's like you are absent... ...'It seems you hear me, but my voice doesn't touch you' 'It seems like your eyes flew... because'... You're a total scatterbrain, you! Yeah. My brain's like a computer... but it's broken down. Come down Pablo, please. Come on, I'd like to try a game out on you. What game? One I learnt a long time ago. Do you trust me? Really? - Lie down here then. - Here? Yes, right here. Relax. Get comfortable. Close your eyes. Good. Feel at ease. Relax the eyes. Let yourself go. You trust me, right? You feel how, gradually, the earth opens beneath your body. And you descend,you descend. And you enter a dark world. At the end of a cave... You make out a small yellow light. Go towards it, get closer. Gradually you make out that there are people. There are people dancing around a fire. Get closer. They shout, laugh, and dance like savages. You get closer, closer, and beside the fire you see,.. a corpse. They're dancing around this body. Go closer. They stop laughing, and you get even closer. You look at the body and discover it's... ...a boy. You look at it with fear, but you can't stop yourself from getting closer. And you recognise him, you know this boy... You know this boy. It's you. Yourself. He gets up, comes closer, and takes you in his arms. He embraces you. He envelops you entirely. This embrace makes you feel what you really are, and how you really are. You are good. You always have been. No matter if you have made mistakes in the past,... You are guilty of nothing. It isn't important what others say. Only you are important. And you are good. Hi Monkey-face. Oh no! Not that again! Yes, yes, yes. Look! Julia, look at this! Ok, enough of that, Pablita. Pablo?.. You've given up coming round, no? Have you forgotten me? What are you saying? No. You don't even look at me anymore. What do you mean Julia, I'm watching you. What are you doing? Since we don't see each other anymore, I'm dead bored. But we see each other, and... We came here not long ago. You want to try the gun out? No, and... and... What? Ok. Look at me, tell me, how's things? - I'm fine. - And your mother? Athome. What are you doing Julia? You're a little kid for sure, and a monkey-face. Not a kid, I'm thirteen. Thirteen, you? More like nine. I'm thirteen. Thirteen no. Eleven. Thirteen. It's like you don't know me, I'm thirteen. Eleven. Man, if you're thirteen and haven't kissed a chick yet... ...And so what? 'And so what?'... Would you like to? How do I know?.. You're like dead man! You don't even laugh anymore. What you mean, I'm not dead... Let's see. Prove it. - How? - Kiss me. And that's a kiss?! Come on Pablo, give me a kiss, property. That's a kiss... Oh dear. I'm going to have to teach you then. Do you want me to teach you? I don't know. And that's only the beginning. Again? Now you. Don't worry, you'll see how you'll like it. But,... down there?! Hi Postman. It's hot, no? You're not working today? Shall we go in? Granddad! So how's this social services thing? Yes... Be quick eh, because if they take me away from here... I'm better dead. Did you speak to that guy again, the one who came? And? Good,good... Again? How I like you! What, working hard? You're not forgetting your bag? Children come on! Everyone come here. Pablo... Some on the right and others on the left. Left and right.. Very good. And now... Pablo's ticklish?! Julia, what you doing here?! What's up monkey-face? What are you doing here? Hey, shit. Hey man, you don't take that shirt off even to take a crap eh? Oh, excuse me. So where've you been, with that guy again? Yeah, that guy's incredible. He's been in the army, he's got his own shop, he's travelled... ...he says he loves the village. It seems like we're the best friends ever now. Me too, I have a good friend. Yeah? I don't know, If he came to live in my house, ...he could be like my father, no? Julia? Remember about that thing yesterday. I don't know... if you want, well... ...you can suck it. No need. I'm going. Just get him to do it! So,do you like it? It's nice. I love it. This is YOUR place then? Yes. That's the end of that dog! Get out of here at once, out of my sight, Now! With this stone and this rope, you know what to do. Dad, please, one more chance! Don't' think of coming back before you get rid of it. Dad, one more chance, it wasn't his fault. Dad. One more chance please... dad... Don't come back before it's done! Idiot! Stay still! Stay still! Go!.. dont' stay!.. You coming fora swim? I'm going in. You should swim with your shirt on. You've been wearing it for three days. Come on, come and swim! No, no. You're not afraid of swimming in this place? Me? Should I be? I'm swimming, your loss. Come in! You know why fish do this? Why? To eat their noses! Fish don't have noses. Of course, that's because they succeeded. You're not cold like that? Get dressed now. That's all I need, them seeing me with you like that. Damn! You're here? I thought you were tourists, it's a place... ...where they usually relax and have picnics. Oh by the way, the mechanic told me that your car's fixed. So if you're in a hurry, you can pick it up when you want. Very good. You've taken a while haven't you? Who? The mechanic? How long have you been looking for us? Me!? No... Cut the acting out! No, no it's my usual delivery route. Many letters for such a small village eh? Only the ones I have to deliver! In any case, I'd like to have a word with Pablo if you don't mind. Ifhe wants. Pablo? Hey Pablo! Pablo! Can you hear me? Shit... Seems pretty clear, no? It seems so, yes. Maybe you should speak to him yourself. Since I can't. And tell him what you haven't dared to tell him until now. It's not normal that a stranger walks around the countryside... ...with a 13 year old boy. Why don't you tell him about... ...the two years you spent in Sevilla jail. Well now, people have started gossiping have they? It's normal that they do... And the lady at the bart old you she saw me in Jerez as well no? Yes, she did. But she didn't only tell me she saw you in Jerez... ...but also WHOM she saw with you in Jerez. I think the time has come for you to disappear now... ...don't you think? I think that you are one too many here. Get lost! It shocks you that I've been in prison? It frightens you? No. Well yes, I spent two y ears in jail. Why? Well, as luck would have it, I sold stolen antiques. I had no clue. Two years. You believe me, right? I think the time has come for me... ...to go back home. What?! No, no, no. Stay in the village. Well you've seen it Pablo, people are gossiping... But,... come live athome. In your house? That'll amuse your mother so much. My mother?.. but you'd be my friend, not her's. Of course. But why do you have to go? I don't get it! Sorry, but I can't give any better explanation. But, please, please don't go. If, but... ...you'd go and not explain it to me?! Pablo, you're thirteen years old for God's sake. And what about it? People would continue talking and... ...and what the hell would I do in this place? Who cares if people talk!? Let's go. Pablo, do you need to go anywhere now? Yes,with you. I'm not sure. Would you mind walking back to the village alone? I need a little time to... think. I'll see you in a couple of hours in the village. In the square. - Go and see Julia fora while, ok? Ok, after that I'll take you to Ubrique. How about it? Bye then. In two hours I'll see you at the square. Leave me the fuck alone! Drop it, faggots! You haven't got the balls to come overhere. Oh no? Do you Want to find out? Come on then, come on try, see who's got the balls for it! Luis?! That idiot. You faggot. Hey wait, wait... He's just being a dick, funny joke, just leave him... You fucking did it! Stay here, stay here! I'm getting his dad! Nothing happened right?! Let's go! Don't say a word, nothing happened right!? Swear you won't say anything! God!God! Help me for God's sake! I don't know! We were overthere playing... and... There was no one, no one! Only that man, that one from the north. The car owner! Which man, which man?! He was here just a while ago with another boy! Who?! The guy from the car! Damned heat. It was your great idea to move here... Paco... ...this isn't working out. What, you mean because of the villagers? Bloody villagers... With your son it was easy. My son? You warned me that it was going to be so diff cult... Pablo this and that... Within two days he's already asking me to live here, just like that. What are you going on about? I'm telling you... he says 'come and live athome'... ...oh well, ok why not... Thatbarwoman saw us in Jerez... No!.. Lola? - Yep, I think so... - When? I don't know. - My God... - Easy, it's not such a big deal... One that gets me is that damned postman... ...quite the character. Fucking postman breaking my balls. Worse than your husband - may he rest in peace. I don't know who's the worse of the two. But with your son, it's good, it went well. Pablo's a little strange, isn't he? Strange? Strange, as in 'a little funny', you know... What nonsense, moron. No way... Yes way, he's goth is little differences I think. Idiot. Bastard! Bastard! Bloody liar! Why the hell did you ever come here for?! Why the fuck did you come here?! Bastard! Don't move! Don't move, stay there! Put it down. Calm down Pablo, for fuck's sake! Get out!Get out! Forfuck's sake Pablo! For the fucker you were. What the... but what happened? What happened? You whore! You fucking whore, shameless whore, in front of your own son. Have you no shame? Filthy bitch! Dad, dad... ...two years it took me to convince your mother to get out of that place. And the idea was to try and convince you. But,... ...you weren't exactly of much help. When your mother... When your mother died, I went looking for you. I don't know if your mother told you... ...how much we loved each other. I loved her. And your father as well. Two friends in love with the same woman. She was in a mess... Then you showed up. Your dad was the clever one. Quicker than I was, son of a bitch. But that's where your mother made the mistake. After your father's accident... ...even tired as she was, how I loved her. We loved each other a lot, Pablo. I don't suppose you have any idea what it is to love a person... ...and then lose them. I asked you here because I wanted to tell you something... ...I think is important you should know. I don't blame you for it all. All these years I learnt not to blame you for it. We don't control our destiny. And you were just a kid, damn it. How much I suffered, damn, how much I suffered. But it affected me, all of this. All that happened has marked me for life.
