(suspenseful music) - Shh, go that way. - [Man] Keep your voice down. - [Man] No one's here. - [Man] Keep your flashlight low. - Is anybody here? - I don't know. - [Man] Shh, shh, be quiet. (girl laughing) - [Man] This is going to take an eternity. The records here go back to the 1940s. - [Man] Derrick Ellison. - [Miss Briggs] Enough! (door shuts) - [Man] What was that? - [Man] Stop making excuses, man, keep looking. - [Miss Briggs] Hello? - [Man] Stay calm. - [Miss Briggs] Is anyone there? - [Man] Miss Briggs, I thought she'd be dead by now. (man grunts) (Miss Briggs screams) (light string music) - [Mel] Where did you find that place, it was amazing. - [Derrick] I have my ways. - Well, it was a perfect birthday lunch, thank you. It's nice to have some us time. - Yeah. - I have an idea. - You do? - Hmm mm. Let's get out of these clothes and cuddle up by the fire. - You read my mind. - Hmm. (chuckles) - [All] Surprise! - Oh my God! Oh my God, you guys. This is amazing, oh my God, you are in so much trouble. - Oh no, this was all me. Derrick was just a pawn in my master plan. - Keeping secrets. - I was under constant threat of bodily harm. - Wait 'til you have one of your own (laughs). - [Alisa] Come on, Mel, it's champagne time! - [Mel] Hi! - How you been, man? You're looking good. - Hey man. - [Dad] Good to see you. - [Derrick] You too. - Thank you so much for this. - [woman] You're so sweet. - Thank you. - I can't believe my dad. - Don't stress. - We have the meeting with the investor tomorrow. - We're the dream team of high end furniture. We got this. - Alright, we got this. - She's right. You got this. Oh, since I'm abandoning you tomorrow for my annoying business trip... - [Mel] What? I'm leaving you with a little something to hold you over and I know, I didn't have to. Love you. (soft music) - Okay, I'm gonna leave you two. - It means for eternity. 'Cause that's how long you're stuck with me. (men vocalizing) - These are absolutely beautiful. I love them. And I love you. - And I love you. (both chuckle) - Were you surprised? - I was so surprised. (both laughing) I almost died, and I'm gonna kill you. - Please don't. - [Alisa] How many times are you gonna rearrange that vignette? - [Mel] Last time, I promise. - Good, because I think that's him. - [Mel] Mr. Crawford? - Please call me Raymond. You must be Melanie. - Yes, welcome. - It's a pleasure. - [Mel] Alisa. - Yeah, that's me. Manager, I'm the manager. - Yes, I gathered. Melanie told me that you'd be joining us. - Have a seat. - Thanks. First of all, I'd like to thank you for being open to meeting with me. I've been following your store for more than a year now through your Instagram account and your lifestyle blog. - That's me. I do all the social media. - So if you're open to it, I'd love to come around in the morning, say nine o'clock, bring you a proposal? Feel free to discuss it with your husband first if you'd like. - How did you know I was married? - The ring. - Oh. - Great. Well, send me a text with your address and I'll pop right in the morning. - Great, that sounds wonderful. Thank you. Thank you so much. - It's my pleasure. Have a lovely day. - Okay. - Lise. - What? (airplane whooshing) Stop. - [Derrick] Just landed, I am on my way home. - Okay honey, I'm waiting for you on the stairs. See you soon. There was staring and gaping and stammering, some muttering thrown in, zero chill. - So you're saying he was that good looking, huh? - Obviously not as good looking as you. But she was clearly smitten. - Well, she's young. - She's only three years younger than I am. I don't drool every time some guy in a suit walks by. (door bell ringing) - Well that's comforting because I believe Prince Charming has arrived. - I'll get it. (knocks on door) Hi, Raymond. - Melanie, so good to see you. - Good to see you too. Thank you so much for coming by. - Of course, I just wanted to drop these off as promised. - Oh great, please come in. - Thanks, I won't stay long. - [Mel] Oh, this is my husband, Derrick. - Nice to meet you. I hear you're gonna make my wife a very wealthy woman. - I'm so sorry, you just remind me of someone I know. - I get that a lot. (both chuckling) - It's a pleasure, Raymond Crawford. - Pleasure. - Do you mind if I borrow your loo? - No, of course. There's one just down the hall or if you want more privacy, there's one upstairs. - Thanks. - The loo? Did Alisa's new boyfriend just jump straight out of a Jane Austen novel? - You said you'd play nice. - I did. (both chuckling) (light string music) - Toast. No you. (car lock beeps) (suspenseful music) - [Man] Hello, Derrick. Derrick Saxons, born November 10th, 1978. - How do you know my name? - [Man] You live with your wife, Melanie, who's exquisitely beautiful by the way, in a four-bedroom, three bath, 5,000 square foot mid-century mansion in Brentwood. Employer: Axis Lane Media, highly regarded for your expertise in social media platform design. - Help! Can somebody hear me? Anybody! - [Man] Soundproof basement. Apparently the previous owner was a composer. Sadly, his career recently took a turn for the worse and voila, here I am. - What do you want? - [Man] You're gonna tell me everything. And I mean everything. Every significant detail of the past, I don't know, 20 years of your life. - What? Why? - [Man] Because I'm gonna take it. - Take what? - Your life. - Alex. - Is this the only color it comes in? I'd love to see it in burgundy. - I'd have to call the company but they might have some photos online. Would you like to take a look? - I'd love to see the actual piece in burgundy. - In burgundy, got it. - Take a looky over there. A front row seat to the end of your life as you know it. - How did you... - Magic. - I can give you money, Alex. If that's what this is about. - And where's the fun in that? Now you get to sit here while you watch me live your life for a bit. Until of course, I've drained your bank accounts, relieved you of your assets, only to disappear into thin air and leave you with a lot of explaining to do. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hi, it's Derrick. - Oh, hey Derrick. - [Alex] Is Mel there? - Is it important? She's with a client. - Ah yeah, it's pretty important. - Alright, hold on. Hey, Mel, it's Derrick. - I'll be right back. Hello. - Mel. - Hi, hi sweetie. Oh my God, Eva is here and she's driving me nuts. What's up? - [Alex] I have to go out of town for a few days. - Oh, okay. What's going on, is everything okay? - Of course, it's the annual Digitech Conference in Chicago. I thought they were sending Mitch but Dale decided he wanted me there again. - Oh okay. Well, I'm gonna miss you. When do you have to leave? - I'm gonna pop by the house and pick up a few clothes and then head straight to the airport. - Oh okay. Well, you gotta do what you gotta do. - Is everything okay? - (mouthing) - She's really sweet. I'm gonna miss you too, babe. I wish there was a way to get out of it. - [Mel] Oh no, no, I totally understand. You go, I have plenty to do here, I'll be fine. - Okay, I'll be in touch. - Please do, I love you. - I love you too. - Bye. - Well I thought that was pretty bloody spectacular if I don't say so myself. - This is crazy. - Is it? - What did he say? - He has to go to a conference in Chicago for a few days. - Aw, bummer. - Yeah, I know. Anyway, I have to get back to the tyrant, wish me luck. - I feel for ya. - [Mel] I'm all yours. - Well apparently you're not. - Sorry about that. - Now tell me about these two chairs. - I know my wife, Alex. She'll know, she'll figure it out. - Well, for her sake and yours, I truly hope that doesn't happen because if it does, I'll have to kill you both. But, enough about all that, we've got a lot of catching up to do. First things first, PIN numbers, bank accounts, passwords, and usernames, and so on and so forth. (people chattering) - Thank you, thanks. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You don't seem fine. - I just miss Derrick. - And? (chuckles) - I don't know, something just seemed a little off before he left, when he called the store, he just... He seemed a little distant or distracted or something. - But darling, he's a man, when are they not distracted? - How do you know how to make everything seem okay? - Sweetie, that's my job. - Thank you. I love you. - I love you too. (suspenseful music) (door creaking) - Get it together. (Skype ringing) Hi. - Hi. - Ugh, God, I wish you were here, honey. I go a little bit nuts in this house when I'm on my own. - What happened? - Oh it was nothing. I just thought I heard something, but I'm sure it was nothing. Anyway, how's it going? - Uh, what? - How's the conference going? They put you in that fancy suite again? You wanna show me the layout? - Yeah, uh. Uh, actually, my addition was so last minute they threw me in a pretty dingy motel across from the venue. It's not much to look at. But let's talk about you. - I can't wait to see you. Oh God, I sound really needy. Do I sound really needy? - Not at all, babe. - (chuckles) Babe? - What? - It's just new. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it, but just gotta get used to it. - Thought I'd switch it up a little. - (chuckles) No, it's fine, it's silly. Anyway, I will see you tomorrow night. I love you. - I love you too, babe, honey, sweet cakes, gorgeous. - Bye. - Bye. No mistakes. You're Derrick Saxons. I am Derrick Saxons, I'm Derrick Saxons. (door bell rings) Can I help you? - You're British? - Yeah, I'm also in a rush. Can I help you? - You're living in Norm's place? - Temporarily, and you are? - Well, I'm Arlis Deirdan, I live next door and I don't mean to be rude but I was just wondering what exactly-- - And I don't mean to be rude but in America, don't people mind their own business? - Well, this house has been in foreclosure for six months and I don't think you have any legal right to be here. And this being a reputable neighborhood, having squatters doesn't bode well-- - Look, mate, I'm sure you've got a family to get back to-- - Actually, no, I lived alone since my wife passed. - My condolences. Couldn't just let it go, could you, Arlis? (gun fires quietly) - (grunts) - Dammit. (birds chirping) (car engine revving) - Boo! - Ah! - (laughs) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - Don't do that. - I'm so sorry. - I wasn't expecting that. - I'm so sorry, I couldn't resist. Wow. - What? - Just missed you, glad you're home. Feels like it's been a year. - Or longer. - Where's your suitcase? - In the trunk. Last thing I feel like doing is unpacking. - Oh yeah? What you rather do? (suspenseful music) - No. No. (Melanie laughs) No, no, no, no. (distorted scream) (man screaming) - Wow. Who are you? - What do you mean? - Just, it was different. - Good? - It was amazing. Oh what's this? - It's nothing. Just a scratch. I got mauled by an old lady's luggage while I was helping her out of the plane. - That's chivalrous. - You look surprised. - A little, it's very sweet. - Get used to it. I'm full of surprises. (birds chirping) (lawn mower whirring) - It was different. I don't know, it was just, it was different. Ugh, I don't know, after two years, you kind of get into a routine. Uh, hold on. (suspenseful music) Hey, I gotta go, bye. - Pathetic. - Knock, knock. (laughs) Just can't stop admiring that can you? - Dale. - Oh hey. Don't forget about our showdown with Zalbreth BioSystems on Friday. This is our last time to catch 'em and I'm gonna need that five handicap. Look at you, just cool as as a cucumber. - Yeah, that's me. - Excellent. See you then. - Of course you golf, you stupid git. - [Alisa] It's just a Post-it. - But it's not just a Post-it. It's our thing, it's our daily thing. We've been doing it for years. No toast in the toaster, no coffee in the microwave. I mean, how could he just forget? - So talk to him. Derrick is a great communicator, for a guy. (both giggling) - Good afternoon. I have a delivery for Melanie Saxons. - Oh, hi, yes, that's me. Wow, thank you. - And just sign right here for me and you'll be good to go. - Great. Thank you so much. Wow. - Woo! A secret admirer? - Last night was wonderful, hope these flowers add a little extra joy to your day. Love, Derrick. - Pretty sure that this trumps coffee and a Post-It. - Derrick sends me flowers for my birthday, maybe the odd anniversary, never a middle of the day Monday bouquet. - So what? Are you saying you would not want flowers? - No, I just, it feels like he's compensating for something. - Mel, I'd love to get flowers. Come on, show some gratitude. Are you even listening to me? Hello? I said show some gratitude. - You're right, I'm sorry, I'm being awful. I should call him. - Probably. - Hi honey. - Hey Mel. - I'm just calling to say thank you for the flowers, they're beautiful. - I'm so glad. - I was very surprised. - I told you I was full of surprises. I can't wait to see you later. I just wanted you to know how much you mean to me. Oh, Dale just walked in. I gotta go. - Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later Love you, bye. - Feel better? - Yes. (suspenseful music) Raymond! - That's how you treat a lady, brother. - [Mel] We weren't expecting you, what's going on? - Hello, ladies, it's good to see you. I was just in the neighborhood. I wanted to stop by and see if you'd had a chance to look over the proposal yet. - We are interested. We are very interested. - Well that's wonderful news. Great, why don't you get together the initial paperwork and I'll take care of the rest? - Got it. - Very good. - Were you really just stopping by the neighborhood? (all giggling) - Oh, you know, I'd just happen to be nearby. Where can I get some food around here? I'm famished. - The Loft... - Yes. - Has fantastic food. It's fantastic. - Yeah, sounds good. Where is it? - I'm actually off now, if you want me to take you. - Yeah, I'd like that very much. - [Mel] I'll hold down the fort. - Okay, I'll see you later. - [Mel] Alright, I'll see you later. Bye, Raymond. Don't forget to get the truffle fries. - [Raymond] Let's have it. - You ready? - Yes, let's go. - [Alisa] You're gonna love it. (indistinct chatter) Oh you will. (suspenseful music) - Derrick? (door bell ringing) (knocking on door) - Dale. - Better hustle, buddy! Tee time is in an hour. - Right. Um, my apologies, I was working on the Axis project. I'll just grab my gear and I'll meet you at the car. I can get changed at the club. - [Dale] Hey, you know-- - So I'm in love. - Again? - Oh shut up. You're not mad at me? - No, why would I be mad at you? - I don't know, the whole don't mix work with pleasure thing. - Oh well just don't break up with him before the deal is done. - Deal. - Well what's he like? - He's perfect across the board. And I think he likes me. - Why wouldn't he? You're gorgeous and you're funny and you're smart. What's not to like? - You're right, I'm kinda awesome. - Mm-hmm. - So how do I play this? - You're invited to dinner on Friday night and you need a date. - I do? - Yes. This is what you're gonna do: You're gonna call Raymond, you're gonna say hi, Raymond, it's me, Alisa. Melanie invited me over to dinner on Friday night and I need a date so I'm not a third wheel. Are you free? Yeah, intriguing, so you meet again. So thank me then. - Alright, well cheers to that! - Cheers. - Cheers. ♪ Friday night ♪ (suspenseful music) - Answer, answer, you brat! Answer, answer, answer, answer, answer, answer. Hey, I need you to do something for me. Of course you golf, it's so bloody asinine. Hey, no, I don't care if he's home, just get to him now and ask him where his damn clubs are. No, now. Clubs, clubs. I can only stall him for another couple of minutes. - Derrick, these were in your shed, where you always keep 'em. What the hell is going on? - Ha, gotcha! I'm just psyching myself up. Hey, you look confused. - Now what the hell you're doing? - Well... (chuckles) Listen. The balls aren't gonna putt themselves. - Quit screwing around. (club thuds) (Dale groaning) - Hi honey. Derrick? Honey? Derrick? Oh my God. - Hey. - Hi. - You're home. - Yes, hi. - I was playing golf with Dale. I didn't tell you? - Uh, no, I mean just now you car is in the driveway. - Oh, right, making sure Dale's car was locked out front. He asked me to get it detailed while he was out of town, and I offered to drop it off for him. - Oh, that's nice. - Anyway, you look exhausted. Why don't you head upstairs and take a nap? I've got a few things to take care of down here. - What are you up to? - Never you mind. Meet me in the backyard, seven sharp. - Derrick-- - Shh. See you at seven. Don't be late. - Wow, Christmas lights? Candles? The fire pit's working. You gotta be kidding me. You did all this? - What do you think? I think... - I think you lost your mind. The flowers and now all of this? You're either asking me to marry you again or you're breaking up with me. - I went overboard. - A little. It's not that I don't love it, I do, I love it. It's just, I don't need flowers and Dom Perignon or this suit. - You don't like it? - No, I just can't remember the last time I saw you wearing a pocket square. - Maybe I'm stepping up my game. And well, you only get one life. I wanna make a toast. - Toast? Okay, toast. - To a new beginning. As if the past doesn't exist and all we have is today. - But I love our past, don't you? - I do. I just want things to-- - Oh, before I forget, Alisa is coming over to dinner with, you'll never guess who. - Don't leave me in suspense. - Raymond, the investor. Remember? Where's the loo? - Ah yes, Mr. Loo. He was an odd one, right? - Right. Well anyway, Alisa really likes him so it would kinda be like a first date. I just thought it'd be nice for them, and for us, and not a bad way to finesse the deal. - I love it, when? - Friday? - Friday. Friday it is. - Great, I'll let her know tonight. Hey, the flowers and the champagne and everything, I didn't mean to be ungrateful. It's really, really thoughtful. Thank you. Cheers. (glasses clink) - [Raymond] I'm here to make other people rich. (all laughing) - [Alisa] Tell Raymond how you two met, it's really adorable. - Oh, I'm actually not a very good storyteller. - [Raymond] Oh, come on, I'd love to hear this. - Yeah you are. - No I'm not, I'm not. Derrick is the storyteller in the family, yeah, once you get him started, he won't shut up, right? (laughs) - Well, can I have another latte or a shot of Tequila before-- - Oh come on, Derrick, don't be modest. - Yeah, we know how you love a captive audience. (suspenseful music) - Well... About three years ago-- - Three and a half. - About three and a half years ago, I'm sorry, am I telling this story? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I was building websites, now this is way before I did what I do now. - And what is it that you do now? - I'm the senior technology designer at Axis Lane Media. - Oh nice. You guys are major players. I've worked with Axis Lane before. - Oh cool. - Glad to hear it. (indistinct chatter) So Melanie was my client, I designed The Hangar's website. - And? - It's a fantastic website, it was one of the first things that drew me in. It's really well-designed. - Oh, thank you. But now he's being modest. He designed the algorithm using search engine optimization which put our site in the number one spot every time. - That's huge. - Apparently, she fell in love with my ability to optimize algorithms. - I'm sorry, am I ruining the story? - Not at all. To be honest, it's all a blur. But I knew immediately, almost like I fell in love with Melanie before I met her. - Oh, I think I'm gonna cry. - [Alex] I mean it. - Would anyone like another latte? - Actually I would love to bag up your dinner rolls, Mel, they're worth every calorie. - Absolutely. - Really everything has been absolutely perfect here tonight, thank you so much for the invite. - Oh my gosh, it's our pleasure. Please, come back, as much as you can. - Of course. - I'm just gonna grab you a bag. - Thanks. - Right, let me help you with that, honey. - [Raymond] What do you think we get out of here? - So what can I do? - Uh, can you give me a baggie? - Sure can. - What are you doing? - Uh, sorry, I'm just... - Getting silverware? - [Alisa] Oh, there's a really cute place not too far from here. - Where are the bags, Derrick? - [Raymond] Mel, don't worry about it. We're just gonna take off. - Oh, hold on. We'll walk you out. (Derrick panting) Derrick? - Yup? - Why were you so hesitant to tell Raymond how we met? - I wasn't. - You left pretty much everything out. How you had Jeremy ask me out 'cause you were so nervous, and the matchbook, the song, you left it all out. - Sometimes I just wanna keep things ours. You know? - And how you kept redesigning the website so you'd have an excuse to see me? You love telling that story. - I don't know, Mel. I just wasn't in the mood. - Why? - Look, since I've been back, everything's been a bit, I don't know, off. - Yeah, I agree. - And you know, I just guess I wasn't ready for company. I just kinda wish it was just us. Tell you what, you have my solemn oath, I will tell that story in great detail every time we have company of any kind. - Even the delivery guy? - I will tell our love story to the delivery guy. - And the creepy lady with the old dog? - Yup. - And the maid? - Every detail. - We don't have a maid. - Exactly. I will hire one specifically so I can tell her. - You know, I think I had a little too much wine so I'm just gonna go to sleep, okay? - Goodnight. (punches thudding) (Derrick groans) Surprise! (laughs) That was amazing! That was like watching Mission Impossible, or Escape From Alcatraz. Get up. - How did you know? - Smile for the camera. And get on the bed. Just so you know, things are going better than I could ever have expected. - You're falling in love with my wife, aren't you? - I'm just playing the part, brother. Keeping her happy 'til I can wrap things up. Now, put those handcuffs on like a good little boy. Or perhaps you've got things turned around, and she's the one falling for me. Stranger things have happened. I suppose I should thank you. I spent the last 30 years wanting your life, and don't get me wrong, for a mid-level techie, you're doing alright. But who would have thought little Mel would be the breadwinner in the family? The Hangar is a goldmine, baby! Must be emasculating for you. - Never been about money, Alex. Something you wouldn't understand. - Once I've emptied your accounts, I'm gonna empty her accounts. Of course, I can't run the risk of her saying I defrauded her and there's only one way to take care of that. - I swear to God, if you touch her... (chains rattling) - Oh wow. Feisty little git, ain't ya? - So that phone call wasn't just important, it was extremely important. I need you to pick up the phone, the one with the little red blinking light, that's my line. Derrick, can I have a word? - What's wrong? - Listen, with Dale going awol, we're in trouble. Where are we with the Zalbreth proposal? The code for the interface should have been set weeks ago. They were hoping to be in beta last week. - Yes, I just, I thought that with Dale disappearing that everything would be-- - Not to sound unfeeling, but Zalbreth doesn't care where Dale is. We need to close this or we're done. Derrick, you got this? I need you right now, the company does. (suspenseful music) - Have I ever let you down? I'll have it to you end of business day tomorrow. - Five o'clock, not one minute later. - End of business day tomorrow. What you looking at? - What are you hiding, Derrick? We said we would never do this. Once you ring this bell, you can't un-ring it. (loud rattling) (suspenseful music) (dog barking) - I checked the perimeter, no sign of an intruder. I'll file a report and have a patrol officer watch your house for 24 hours. - Okay, thank you. - Mrs. Saxons, your husband is... - He's working. - Have you contacted him about this? - Yeah, I left him several voicemails, he should be home any minute. - Do you have an alarm? - Yes, it was set. - And I assume he has the code? - Of course, yes. - Could he have stopped by and then gone out again without saying anything? Maybe assuming you were asleep, not wanting to wake you? - No, no. I know my husband, he... To be honest, I don't know what he would or wouldn't do right now. - Mrs. Saxons? - What? - If you think of anything else, give me a call. - Okay. - Okay. Turn that alarm back on. - [Mel] Of course. (door locks clicking) - What is this? You intentionally left this out, why? - I'm exhausted, you can't expect me to somehow hand you every event, memory, relationship, appointment I've had in my entire-- (slap thuds) - Fix it! (slap thuds) Fix it! Here's how this is gonna work. I'm gonna sit over here and you're gonna sit there and finish that. - You want me to finish it tonight? - No, you're going to finish it tonight. - But there's-- - Shut up! I gotta wrap this up and move on. I'm just waiting for Melanie's company to transfer and waste not want not and all that, then I'll cash out and kill her, slowly, horribly-- - That wasn't part of the deal. You said once you got what you wanted-- (Alex laughs) - I changed my mind! Now get to bloody work! And here's some incentive. If you don't, I'll kill her the minute I get home. - I'll finish it. I'll finish it by tomorrow. (suspenseful music) - Hello? - Hi, I'm so sorry to call so late, Diane. This is Melanie. - Melanie? - I was just wondering, is Dale-- - Melanie, Dale has been missing. - What? - Dale is missing. - Since when? Oh my God. - I'll do my best. - Okay, I'm so sorry. Please let me know when you hear from him. Okay. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, bye. (phone buzzing) - What are you doing? Get back to work. You reached Derrick Saxons, leave a message after the tone. (phone beeps) - Derrick, where are you? I've called you 10 times. I'm getting worried. Just call me back, okay? Bye. Derrick? - Hey! Go back to bed, I'll be right there. - What time is it? - Wait. - You were out all night? - I told you I had to finish the proposal for Dale. He's really riding me. What? - You didn't answer your phone. - It must have died. I had to get it done by today. Dale, he moved the deadline up. - He did? Dale did? - Why are you questioning me? You think I'm not under enough pressure as is, without being interrogated by my own wife? I'm sorry. I'm going to wash up. (door creaks) You stupid bloody idiot. She knows, she knows! She's gotta know! (panting) Stop it. Stop it! You are Derrick Saxons. - It's totally out of character. I mean, I'm not exaggerating when I say that Derrick never stays late, much less all night. I mean that's one of the benefits of doing what he does. He can work from home too. - And he didn't answer his phone. - No, and he lied about staying to work late for Dale. I spoke to Dale's wife and she said Dale hasn't been home in three days. - Okay, that is weird. - Yes, and then he left before I woke up this morning and this being overly romantic all of the time. it's like he's trying too hard or compensating for something. He's either cheating on me or I don't even know. - Derrick. - I know. I can't believe I'm even saying this. - Look, I adore Derrick, but I'm sure you're not the first woman to say that only to discover that her husband has been sleeping with his secretary for the last five years. - Alisa! - I'm just saying. - Oh my God, I don't even know anymore. I mean even the detective thought I was completely insane. You know what? I am done with this. I need to know what's going on. Alisa, I need you to do something for me but it might be a little bit risky and you don't have to do it-- - I'm in. - Are you sure, because-- - I'm in. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Hi, what do you want? The hell do you mean they found the body? You said you handled it. It's clearly not handled. What about the business? How long before they transfer ownership? She's noticing things. - [Waiter] Are you ready to order, sir? - Do I look like I'm ready to order? - No, sorry, my mistake. (phone buzzing) - Mel, you're not gonna believe this. I'm at the Pour House and Derrick is on his phone talking about a dead body and transferring money or something, and even crazier Mel, he had an English accent, I'm not even kidding. Just call me back, okay? - Don't, don't make a sound. Close the door. And walk. - Derrick, what are you doing? - Shut up, keep moving. You drive, get in. Take a left. - [Alisa] What is going on? - The less you know the better. That is, if you're keen on living. Secondly, that was a God awful disguise. Take a right. A hat and sunglasses? (laughs) Really? - Well that's a God awful accent. What happened to you? - (sighs) Take a right. Truth be told, I'm Derrick's twin brother. - Seriously, Derrick? That's the best you could come up with? Look, if you're in trouble, you can just tell me. - Derrick's twin brother, Alex, and the accent is real, thank you very much. Take a right. And I really wish you'd minded your own business. Brought you a present. - Derrick, what the hell is going on? - Where's Melanie, has he hurt her? - Shut up, she's fine, for now. - Derrick, you have a brother? - You'd think the uncanny resemblance would be a dead give away. - Shut up, Alex! - Solitary confinement can make a person a bit testy. I talk from experience. 10 years in the hole can drive a person mad. Sit down, darling. He's tried, believe me, and yet... Here he is. Pop those on. I had those reserved for Melanie, next chapter in this little saga. And yet, here you are. Well, on a positive note, you have each other. I'm off. I have a wife to attend to. - Derrick? (suspenseful music) Jesus, how did I miss this? - [Alisa] Mel, you're not gonna believe this. I'm at the Pour House and Derrick is on his phone talking about a dead body and transferring money or something. And even crazier Mel, he had an English accent, I'm not even kidding. - [Derrick] Nellingham, it's one of the poorest boroughs in London. Our parents died when we were three years old. A car accident, so we ended up at the Nellingham Orphanage. - Why didn't you tell Melanie? - It was so long ago, I just felt like it was a different lifetime. I justified that it wasn't a part of me. What can I say? We were brothers. I loved him. - Oh God. - [Derrick] But there was something wrong with him. He killed a bunch of squirrels, he kept bringing in these rats. - [Mel] What's this? - When my adopted parents chose only me, I was more relieved than I'd wish I was. Because I was always afraid of him. He was brilliant... But always a psychopath. - Mel, I'm home. (intense suspenseful music) What's going on? - Oh, I was just finally getting around to collecting some of our dirty blankets for the dry cleaning. Do you have anything to add? - Nope. What's for dinner? - Let's take a look. Oh I just realized that I left three invoices upstairs, I need to send out. I really need to get those out. Would you mind-- - Say no more. While you do that, I'll whip something up for dinner, sound good? - Sounds good. - I don't get a kiss? - Love you. - [Derrick] I wanted to get as far away from him as possible. - Alright, what is on the menu tonight? - But America wasn't far enough. He wasn't supposed to find me, Alisa. - I don't understand, he's your twin brother, Derrick. - Alex isn't right. - Clearly. - I mean... ever since I can remember, when he was a kid, he was...troubled, I mean, really troubled, erratic, irrational, violent at times, uncontrollable. I defended him, I defended him for a long time, trying to help him, but I realized he was... Broken. - [Alisa] Broken how? - He's evil, Alisa. He was just born bad. - I, um... got a weird message from Alisa today. - Really? Weird how? - It was... It was about you. - Me? How so? - Honestly I don't really know, it didn't really make sense, I guess she happened to be at a diner that you were at this morning and she overheard a phone conversation that you were having? - Really? - Hmm mm. - I wasn't at a diner this morning. In fact, I skipped breakfast and went straight to work, I thought I told you. - No, you did. I just thought maybe you changed your mind or something. - Straight to work. Well, did she say hello? - What do you mean? - I mean, if she thinks she saw me, wouldn't she say something? - Oh she said that you, or that he looked busy. - At a diner? Busy doing what? Getting an omelet? - I'm sure she just made a mistake. - You do believe me, don't you? - I do. - Have I ever lied to you? - Never. - Exactly. I need you to trust that I would never do anything to hurt you. Alisa just needs to mind her own business. - I think that she was just-- - I'm concerned. I'm concerned that you trust her more than you trust your own husband. - That's not true. (dog barking) (phone beeps) What? (suspenseful music) Lise, it's me, I got your text. Why aren't you picking up? I've been calling you all morning. Can you just give me a call back, please? Bye. Hi, Raymond. - Hey! - Yeah, where are you? Okay I need your help, it's regarding Alisa. - Of course. - Thank you. (knocking on door) (door bell ringing) Alisa! - Alisa! - [Mel] Alisa, are you there? It's Melanie. - We've been knocking for five minutes, if she were here, she would have heard us by now. - Did she say anything to you? - No, like I said, I haven't heard from her for a few days. We had plans for this weekend. She never got back to me. - She has to be here. She said she was sick. Wait a minute. I just thought of something. - What? - [Mel] There's one more place we have to look. - Where? - Just trust me. - Okay. - Yesterday I found this old photo of Derrick with his, well, you're not gonna believe me, but his twin. He has a twin, Raymond. You don't believe me. - [Raymond] No, no, no, I'm just saying, I believe you, I do. - I knew it. This is her car. - Alright, let's just focus. What we know right now is that Alisa's car is here and she is not. So what do you wanna do next? - You're right. We have to go to the police. (suspenseful music) - Okay. - [Alex] Derrick and I are at a corner hustling some bloke, Miss Briggs broke it up, after that she kept us separated. - [Alisa] He told me. - Did he? - He did. Everything. - Everything? Did he tell you about Miss Briggs and her hickory switch? Vengeance in one hand and rosary in the other, ooh and she loved it too. But Derrick here was her favorite. Which is probably why you ended up in America. Adopted by the perfect parents, to grow up in the perfect family, in the perfect neighborhood with the perfect home and the perfect wife and the perfect job while I... While I rotted away in that God forsaken place. Alone. - You were children. - Shut up! You weren't there. You haven't a clue what you're talking about. - Leave her alone, Alex. - Enough of this little chat. I've gotta get home. - So let me get this straight. The last time you heard from your friend was a text allegedly sent from the Pour House. - Yes. Well no, she sent me a text this morning saying that she wasn't feeling well so she wouldn't be coming in to work. - So she works for you? - Yes, she does. - Got it. Does your friend drink by chance? - Uh, occasionally, why? - I get this all the time. Out partying the night before, a few too many drinks, choose to take an Uber and avoid the DUI. - Who drinks at a diner? And isn't that a little bit of a leap? If that had happened, she would have called me, we're very close. And she wasn't at her house. - Maybe she slept elsewhere. - Yeah, I don't think that was the case, Detective. - Who are you? - I'm her boyfriend. We're dating at least and she definitely didn't sleep at my place last night. - It's been less than 24 hours. A bit too early to file a missing person's report. - So if I tell you that's she's not an alcoholic or a tramp, then can you do your job? - Okay, okay, let's just dial it back here a notch, I think the detective is trying to do his job. - Any more intruders? - No, what exactly are you suggesting? - We're just concerned. It's not like Alisa to disappear like this. - I apologize if I gave the wrong impression. Just trying to rule out all possible scenarios, just protocol. - Fine. I understand. So what can we do now? - At this point, not a lot. Fill out the necessary paperwork and go home and get some sleep. - That's it? - Alright, thank you, Detective. We certainly appreciate you taking the time. - Wait a minute. - You've got my number. If you don't hear from her by tomorrow afternoon, give me a call. - It's okay. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) Oh my God, you scared me. - I called you four times. It's almost midnight. - What? - Where have you been? - I accidentally left my phone on vibrate, I was just at the shop late doing inventory, that's all. - It's fine. I was worried about you. - Are you gonna let me in? - Of course. I'm sorry, honey, come in. Come in. Do you need anything? - No, I think I just need to get a good night sleep. You know you might wanna sleep in the guest room tonight, I think I'm coming down with something. - Sure, I understand. That's very thoughtful of you. - Thank you. - No. - Oh you're just standing there. - Actually, there's a couple things Dale asked me to do before tomorrow so I'll just be... I'll just be in the office. - Okay. I'm gonna get ready for bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - I love you, Melanie. Come on, wait. Come on boy, why stop here? Why can't you do it? You can do this. You can shoot her. I can't do it. You're gonna go to prison, you're gonna go to prison. Prison, for a woman, for that woman. She loves me, me, me. I don't deserve her. I can't do it. (laughing maniacally) Yes, you can, now calm down. You are Derrick Saxons. I am Derrick Saxons. - Where are you? Where are you, Lise? - Hey, Mel? - Oh, I thought you were sleeping in the guest room. - I just, I needed to talk to you. It's just I know I've been acting strangely lately and while I was away, something triggered me. It's a long story which I've been meaning to tell you. - It's okay. I understand. (phone buzzing) - Ugh, great timing. It's business. I'm so sorry but I'm gonna have to take this. - Oh no, it's okay, don't worry about it, just, I'm gonna go downstairs and make some tea. - Are you sure? - Yeah, of course. - What? This better be important. Are you sure about that? (suspenseful music) - Listen to me, she is dangerously close to understanding everything. We spent the entire day running around the city searching for Alisa. - Why would you let her do that? - What precisely was I supposed to do? You asked me to follow her. She saw your vehicle in the car park at the diner. We have to move up the timeline. Are you listening? - Yeah, I'm listening. - Are you? Are you listening, Alex? Because I'm telling you she is going to find out. - Just shut up, let me think. Think, think. - Look, she's stalling on signing the contracts which leads me to believe that she is on to us. Why aren't you hearing me? - Okay, plan B. I need you to do what I said. And this time exactly what I said. Exactly. I'll sleep downstairs. - That's probably best. (birds chirping) Derrick? Derrick, are you there? Detective Grant, please. (phone ringing) - Mrs. Saxons, how are you? Any word from-- - He has a tattoo. - Who does? - My husband. - Hold on, slow down. - He's not my husband. - A tattoo? You do know that's not illegal, right? - No, no, you don't get it. He's an imposter. - Because he has a tattoo? - No, it's not just the tattoo. I went in Derrick's office and he has a box of documents and photographs. Look, I know this sounds crazy and I know you think that I'm just a paranoid person, but can you-- - Oh, hold on, Mrs. Saxons, I'm gonna have to call you back. - No, no, please, please don't call me back, please. - Maybe the first step would be a marriage counselor. - Damn you. (knocking on window) - (screams) Don't do that! - I'm so sorry. - Get in! - I just wanted to make sure you were okay. - Get in! - [Raymond] Okay. - I activated Find my Device on my iPad which I hid in his car last night and I'm praying it will take us straight to Derrick. That man is not Derrick, he had a tattoo of a spiderweb. Do you know what that means? - Uh, that he likes spiders? - No, it's a prison tattoo. It means trapped. - Well did you call the police? - [Mel] I don't have a lot of credibility with Detective Grant. - Take a right here. - Okay. - Wait, what exactly are you expecting us to find if we find anything at all? - I guess we'll find out. - [Raymond] Yeah, I guess we will. - Do you think he's inside? - I don't know. Is that his car? - Yeah. - Jesus. - I know Derrick is in there and Alisa probably is too. - I really hope you're wrong about that, Melanie. - We gotta get inside. - Hold on, wait, wait, wait. This is all getting a little intense. Can we just slow down? - Look, you're either in or you're out, but I need to get some answers right now. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't have you storming into a situation that could be potentially dangerous. Let me just go in first, check things out, alright? - Fine, two minutes, you get two minutes and then I'm coming in. - Okay. I'll be right back. (suspenseful music) (phone buzzing) - Hi, Detective Grant, this is Melanie Saxons. - Oh no. - I need you to just listen, please? - Hold on, slow down. - Just listen! - Listen, we are directly outside, she's coming to the front door right now. Yes, I'm coming in the back. - Ah, don't do that. - [Mel] I have to. I'm going in. - God, no. (dramatic music) Oh Mrs. Saxons... You had to be a hero. - I'm going in. - Come in. - Where is my husband? - Congratulations. You figured it out, didn't you? Come on, I won't bite. - Where is he? - [Alex] I'm sorry, Melanie. (gun fires) (Mel screams) - Oh my God, Raymond. What the hell is wrong with you? - Alright, enough, enough, enough. Let's go. Let's go pay Derrick a visit. - Mel! (Mel grunts) (Alex groaning) You need help, Alex. - What? What, brother, what? - Let her go. I'll do anything, anything. I'll give you anything. What do you need? - What, brother? What can I have? Can I have the last 30 years back, huh? Can you give me that? Can you make her love me? Huh, can you do that? I didn't think so. I mean, let's be honest, given the current situation, I'd say that ship's pretty much sailed, wouldn't you? - You need help, Alex. - What I need, brother, is you gone. - [Derrick] Alex, what are you doing? We are actually brothers. - Please don't. - This was all supposed to be so easy. But unfortunately, for everyone involved actually, Melanie's feminine instincts kicked in before things could wrap themselves up. So close. All I needed was one signature, but you sniffed it out, didn't ya? - You don't have to do this. - Please, please, just let us go. We won't tell anyone. - It is unfortunate that you have to die too, Alisa, but... Collateral damage, I'm afraid. Wrong place, wrong time. - Alex. - What do you want, Melanie? - Thank you. - Mel, I'm about to kill your husband, your best friend and then you, what could you possibly thank me for? - I couldn't figure it out, how it was so different after the trip, or what was different but it all makes sense now. - What does? - I felt cared for again. Finally somebody was paying attention to me. I haven't felt that in so long, Alex. I've been alone. All Derrick cares about is his work. - Please don't, please don't. - I wanna believe that, Melanie, I really do. - We were done, I wanted a divorce. I'm sorry, Derrick but it's true and you know it. - Is she telling the truth? - And then you gave me what he couldn't. Finally I felt important to someone... And cherished And loved. - You felt all that? - Come on, Alex. I know you felt it too. You did, didn't you? You can ask Alisa. I called her after the first night. - It's true, she did. She said she had never been so happy, that after Chicago, Derrick was a different man, I swear to you. - It's not too late. We can leave, just you and me. We can take the money and we can disappear. Is that what you want, Alex? Is that what you want, Alex? - I do. I do want that. (intense suspenseful music) Why would you do that? (Alex grunting) - [Derrick] The gun! Melanie, get the gun. - Freeze! Put the gun down, Melanie, put the gun down. It's okay. Put it down. I got this. Okay. - [Derrick] I love you. - I love you so much. This was so nice. I think we needed to go on a few more of these dates because it's not just gonna be the two of us for that much longer. - Hey, after everything that's happened, you sure you want to start a family with me? - Hey, remember these? - Eternity. - Mmm-mm. That's how long you're stuck with me. - Come here. - (laughs) (light music) - Surprise! (laughter and indistinct chatter) - Congratulations. - [Derrick] Wow, look at this. - You guys are amazing planners. (indistinct chatter) (suspenseful music) (light music) (camera film reeling) (dramatic music)
