(Wine splashing) (gentle hum) (glasses clink) (owl hooting) (chimes jingling) (gentle music) (woman sighs) - [Woman] No. - [Daughter] Hey, Mom. Come here. Don't worry about that, I got it. - [Woman] Sure. - [Daughter] You know, all you have to do is ask for a bit of help around here. Nothing to be ashamed of, asking for help. - [Daughter] Yeah. Well, you know, I like to get things done myself. - Well, I'm here. Look, what happened next door to poor Barry, it just puts things into perspective. - Yeah, well, I mean, Barry had problems for years. He was getting on, honey. It's hardly surprising it happened. - Yeah, well, all I'm saying is you take it easy, all right? - Sure. - [Daughter] Hey, you want this up on the line? - Yeah, if you want. Can you make sure you hang it up nicely this time? The last time you hung it up, it was all creased and I had to iron it all. - Sure, Mom. - Took me twice as long. (Owl hooting) (ominous music) (soft screeching) (tense music) (chimes jingling) (soft screeching) (soft screeching) (soft screeching) (soft screeching) (soft screeching) (loud screeching) (monster snarling softly) (screams) (monster screeching loudly) (groans) (screaming) (monster growling loudly) (water splashing) (ominous music) Carol? Carol! Carol! (Monster screeches softly) (gasps) (panting quickly) (floor creaking) (whimpering softly) (bullets clattering) (bullet clattering) (footsteps treading) (monster screeching loudly) (woman gasping) (monster snarls softly) (woman whimpering loudly) (monster screeches loudly) (woman screaming) (gun firing) - Mom, just let me, okay? It's not a big deal. If Dad's sick, we're there. - I said no. I'm not having you all drag yourselves down here. Your dad is fine, Rita. You need to listen to me. He's had these happen to him the last few years. It's his pacemaker. Ever since they corrected it, he's had these heart issues. - Mom, we're coming tomorrow, okay? I don't care how big or small the issue is, we're there. - You're being foolish. It'll take you half a day, Rita. - So? Alan's got that old truck. We can make a trip of it, the kids and us. We're coming, all right? You're not sitting in that house alone, no way. - You're just like your father, you know that? I love you. - Love you too, Mom. (Monster screeches softly) (tense music) - We're going, Alan, okay? We're going. - You don't need to tell me twice. I'll ring work in the morning and we can head straight there. - It's my dad. I can't not be with him. - Hey. Come on. - [Rita] Do think he's gonna be okay? - Your dad's been in and out of there time and again. He probably knows the nurses by name. He'll be fine. - We should tell the kids. - You leave the kids to me. You're gonna have a long, hot bath. - You should clean out that truck. The kids will have a fit. - Yeah, I was thinking that myself. - Thank you for being so supportive. - You don't have to say that. (Birds chirping) Hey, I got those. - Thanks. - Don't go inside, they're still going at it. - Look, should I just say that he can't come? I don't wanna be driving for hours with them screaming in my ear the whole time. - Just tell them to break up. - Ben, don't. She's your sister. They're having a rough time. - Hell, everyone knows the amount they argue. (Chuckles) - Don't encourage him. - Yeah, Dad. - Hey, I'll get these. - Oh, I'm sorry, I should just put my granddad on hold, shall I? - That's not what I'm saying, Charlie. Stop putting words into my mouth. Look, I'm just saying that I had the weekend planned. I spent some money, no, I wanted you to get it and appreciate it. - Ty, I get it. You spent some money on a fancy restaurant or whatever, but I have to go with my family now. - Why don't you get it, Charlie? Why am I always the one trying? - Well, hello, little lady. Can I offer you a ride? - Oh, my god, stop. - You realize there's only one bed in the back, right? - Actually, there's not much room at Grandma's, so I was hoping you wouldn't mind crashing in the back while we stay there? - Fine. - [Rita] Thank you, baby. (Smacks lips) - Okay, he's coming with us. Please don't give us a lecture, and, no, we will not screw in Gran's house. And, please, no sex talk. - Okay. Well, then, Ty, welcome. Everybody, hop on board the van of wonders. - Jeez. - Is he gonna do that the entire drive? (Rita laughs) - Come on. (Gentle music) - [Tyler] Can still make it worth our while. Can still make a weekend out of it. It's about us two being together now, right? - How long have we got? - Oh, about another 10 miles or so. - Want me to take over? - No, I'm good, buddy. - Is Mom, okay? I mean, obviously not, but how is she doing, do you think? Like, in all seriousness. - Think the quicker she's with your grandma, the better. She just worries. You know how your mom's like. - Do you think Grandpa will be okay? - That's a tough one, buddy. I don't know. I don't have an answer. He's been in and out of that hospital all year since he had the heart attack. It's... I hope so, but he isn't getting any younger. Hey. Hey, come on. None of this. - [Ben] I just need a second, that's all. - Okay. I'll get us in. You let us know when you're ready. - [Tyler] Oh, hey, Alan, quick question. Do we have any snacks? - Ty, we sure do. Okay, what you want, huh? (Muffled speaking) - I don't get why people live in random places like this. Like, what a way to live. - People like different stuff, I guess. - Hey. You gonna tell them? - It's not the right time, Charlie. And this clearly isn't the right time to be talking about this. - I thought that's the point of you coming back from college. Get it off your chest, tell them. They gotta find out sooner or later. (Door thuds) - Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. - Are we leaving? Kids, you ready? - Let's go! (Gentle music) You go inside, we'll sort the bags out, okay? Kids, give me a hand with the bags. (Clock ticking) - Mom? Mom? - Where's Grandma? - She's not here. - Are you sure? - I've checked every room. I can't find her. - Maybe she's gone next door to see Sanndra. - Okay. Well, can we go check? - [Alan] Kids, we're going next door. Just stay here. (Ominous music) (chimes jingling) - I just don't understand it. It's not like Mom. - Look, maybe everybody leaves their doors open. We're not in the city. - It's not like that, Alan. People don't leave their doors open. Sanndra, you here? Something's not right here, I can feel it. - Look, let's just go back to the house. Let's phone the local hospital. Maybe they've gone to see your dad. - Alan, I just-- - Hey. Come on. Come on. - [Ben] Do you think something's wrong? - [Charlie] No. No, I think Grandma left. - [Ben] Think she left the door open? - [Charlie] If she was in a rush, then sure. - And who would have driven her? - [Charlie] What do you mean? - Grandma doesn't drive. Hasn't for years, so who would have taken her out of here? - In other news, Charlie says you're gonna tell your folks that you got that girl pregnant this weekend, one at Bafflin College, congrats. - Really? - Shit, Ben-- - Why are you telling people, Charlie? - Ben, come on, don't be like that, I-- (sighs) (sighs) Nice one. (Switch hook clacking) - [Rita] Nothing. - [Ben] Any news? - [Alan] Ben, can I borrow your phone? I can't get a signal. - What's going on? - Not sure yet. Come on. (Alan sighs) Charlie, Ty, can you check your phones? Are they working? - It's dead. - We're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, they don't normally get a signal this far out. - Yeah. Me and your mum might need to go into town. Just sit tight, okay? - Are you okay? Dad, what's going on? - Nothing's wrong. We need to get a signal. - [Ben] I'm coming with you. - No, just stay where you are. - No. I'm coming. - Let him come. Charlie, you stay here and wait for Grandma to get back. - Sure. (Engine whirs) - The battery's flat. I must have left the lights on. - You didn't leave the lights on, Dad. - Well, then I don't know, but the thing won't start. - Well, it was working perfectly fine before. - Look, let's walk into town, it's not far. Okay, let's go. Ty, can you do me a favor? - [Tyler] Of course. - Can you have a look at the jeep and see if you can figure out why it won't start? - On it. - Okay, we need to go into town. We'll be back within the hour. - And if Grandma gets back? - Just hang tight with her, okay? - Sure. - Ty. Push this over here, will you? - [Tyler] Sure. (Birds chirping) - Bill's. He knows Nan, right? She sees him weekly? Maybe she sent him along. - No. Something's wrong. Something's off. Why are all the stores closed? - Rita, calm down, all right? I know you're panicked, but there's gotta be a reason. - Hey, guys. The back entrance, come on. - Grandma's old car is dead. Any luck? - I don't get it. Never seen anything like it. It all seems fine down here. There's no issues with the battery, the fuel. It's like it just gave up. - Well, there has to be something, right? It can't just collapse and die. - Yeah, I just don't get it. - Bill? - Hello? Anyone here? - Bill! (Uneasy music) (ominous music) What is it? - I... I... - Hey. Hey, you okay? (Man gurgling) Hey, come on. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, what? - They made something in the lab. It got out. - What got out? What got out? - You gotta get outta here. - You're okay. Hey, stay with me. Hey. Come on. Hey. Stay with me. You're gonna be okay. (Man gurgling) You're all right, man. - Go! Run! (Man gurgles) (monster screeches softly) (footsteps pattering) (monster screeches softly) (ominous music) (jar crashes) (ominous music) (monster snarling softly) (glass clattering) (tense music) (monster screeches softly) (monster exhaling softly) (monster growls) (thrilling music) (whimpering softly) - Help. Help me. (Whimpering softly) Help. (Crying softly) Help me. - Grandma? - What is it? We found this. Alan, what is it? (Tense music) - [Alan] Something's seriously wrong here. We need to go leave, now. - [Rita] Alan. (Gasps) - Oh, my god. (Gasps) What could have done that? - I don't know, but we don't wanna be here if it comes back. We gotta go. We gotta go. (Grandma whimpering softly) - Help me. (Monster growling softly) (gasps) (tense music) (Charlie screaming) (Grandma screaming) (monster growling) (Charlie grunting) (Charlie groans) (Charlie screaming) (whimpering loudly) (monster growls) (Charlie crying loudly) (monster growling) (Charlie screams) Run, baby, run! Run! (Charlie grunts) Run, baby, run! (Charlie whimpering loudly) (monster howling) (Charlie screams) (thrilling music) (Charlie groaning) (door rattling) (screaming) (monster snarling loudly) (panting) (Charlie gasps) (monster screeches loudly) (screams) (monster growling) - Run, Ty, run! - Charlie, what the hell's going on? - Ty, run! - What's happening to you? - Go! - Charlie, what's happening?! (Monster screeches loudly) - Come on! (Whimpering softly) (ominous music) - What is going on? Charlie. - Keys! Where are the keys?! Come on! Quick, come on, the keys! (Keys jingle) Oh! - Charlie, what the hell? Charlie, what's going on? - Get in! - Charlie. (Screams) (screams) Charlie. Help me. Help me. Help. Help. Help me. (Monster growls) (Charlie screaming) - What do you think did this? Some beast? - I have no idea, but whatever it is, to do that, it's gotta be huge. - We've gotta find my mom. (Whimpering softly) (thuds loudly) (Charlie gasps) (tense music) (monster snarls softly) (thudding loudly) (monster snarling softly) (whimpering softly) (footsteps treading) (trailer rattling loudly) (Charlie screaming) (monster howls) (Rita gasps) - Oh, my god. - What the hell makes a sound like that? - Charlie. - What happened here? (Monster screeches softly) (monster screeches softly) (ominous music) (monster snarling softly) (monster snarls loudly) What is it? We can't leave them out there. What if they're alive? We gotta get them. - It's sonic radar. Okay? Whatever the hell that thing is, right, it's making those noises and it's using the sound to reflect it off everything, yeah, to you understand the makeup of its surroundings. It can't see us. Okay? So it's listening to our movements, waiting for us to make a noise. It's hunting us by sound. Okay? - Whatever the hell that thing was, it was a face full of teeth. (Ominous music) (lock clacks) (grunts softly) (window creaking) - [Charlie] Damn it. Damn. - I think it's gone. Now's our chance, okay? - What? - Now's our chance. I gotta get her outta there. - Dad, no. - [Rita] Alan, you can't go out there, not yet. - We haven't got a choice. It could come back at any second. - [Rita] Alan, please. Please? - Shh, okay? Okay? All right? (Door creaking) (owl hoots) Stay. (Alan gasps) (somber music) (whimpers softly) - Dad. - Shh. Shh. Shh. (Ominous music) (monster screeching softly) There. Go. (Monster screeching softly) Go! Now! (Monster screeches softly) (screams) (screaming) (tense music) - [Charlie] Dad. (Charlie whimpering loudly) - [Rita] Ben, I need some help. I need some help. Let's get her upstairs. (Charlie coughing) Set her down. (Charlie whimpering softly) It's okay. We're gonna get some supplies. (Ominous music) - You're gonna be okay. It'll be okay. - Ty is dead. (Crying softly) - [Rita] Look at me, okay? You're gonna be okay. Look at me, you're gonna be okay. Take these, okay? Bill had to know we came. (Ominous music) (monster growling softly) (monster snarling softly) (crying softly) - Grandma's alive. - [Rita] It's okay. It's okay, it's gonna be okay. I'm here. What happened to Grandma, Charlie? - She was in the barn. She was in danger. - What do you mean? (Charlie coughing) (whimpering softly) Water. Go get her some water. It's okay, it's gonna be okay. I'm here. Mom's here. It's gonna be okay. She's sleeping. She has something. I've never seen anything like it. Some kind of virus. - Maybe from her wounds? - You wouldn't get that type of virus from an infection from what's happened to her. (Sighs) I don't know what it is. She needs to see a doctor. - Dad could still be alive. - I know. - We need to do something, Mom. - Charlie said Grandma was at the end of the stalls in the stable in a room. If she's alive, we need to get her outta there. - That thing out there, how do we get past it? - Your dad said it was depending on sound. If it can't see, it's waiting on us to make mistakes, right? So we don't make a mistake. We get to where we need in silence. We find them, we get them back here, and we wait for help. - We can't just sit here and wait. We've gotta get out of here. - Half of the family are in bad shape. - I can go. I'm fine. I can run and keep running until I get help. - What if there's more of them? We don't know what's out there. What if whatever the hell that thing is is taking over town by town? It's not safe. - It's better than waiting for it to get us. - Let's just find Grandma, then get Dad, okay? - That thing, what do you think it was? (Sighs) - When I was a little girl, they told us to stay away from the barracks nearby. They said it was a contamination zone and that it was off-limits to the public. - The place we drove through on the way here? - It's been there all my entire life. We all made up stories about what goes on in there. - [Ben] Like what? - No one ever believed them 'cause no one saw it and nothing ever happened. - You can tell me just about anything right now, Mom, and I won't think you're crazy. - They said that they made military weapons in there. - Do you think that thing was manmade? - Hybrid or something. - Why'd they let it out on us? - Or it escaped. I can't sit here any longer. I gotta go get Grandma. - [Ben] I'm not leaving you alone. - No. Charlie needs you. - Dad and Grandma are out there, and you won't be able to help them on your own. I'm coming, Mom. - No. Listen to me, for once in your life, Ben. You're staying here, okay? Look after your sister. (Charlie coughing) - Watch, you're gonna be okay. Look at me. Look at me. (Charlie whimpering loudly) You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. (Charlie coughing) - What's happening to me?! (Ben whimpering softly) (water splashes) (ominous music) (tense music) Fuck. (Whimpering softly) (Charlie whimpering softly) (gasps) - Mom. (Monster snarls softly) (Grandma whimpering softly) - Please, help me. - How do I get this off? - Hurry up. - Shh. Shh. Shh. We gotta be quiet. Please, Mom, shh. It's gonna be okay. - Gonna be okay. - Okay. (Monster growling softly) (knife thuds) (Charlie grunting) (knife thuds) (panting) (blood squirting) (groans softly) (tense music) (gasps) (monster growls softly) (whimpering softly) - Charlie. - I found something inside me. I gotta get it out. Come on. (Charlie groaning) (monster snarling softly) (crying softly) (water splashes) (gasping loudly) - Give me the knife. - No. - What the hell are you doing? - What is happening to me? Where are they all coming from?! Please. (Crying softly) - We gotta get you help. (Whimpering softly) (monster snarls softly) (monster snarling softly) (water splashes) (Rita gasps) (monster snarls loudly) (Rita screaming) (monster howling) - Hey! (Crying loudly) (Rita screams) Come and get me! (Monster snarls softly) (monster exhaling) (Ben whimpering softly) (monster growls softly) (Rita crying softly) - Get it off me, get it off me. (Spiders clattering) (Rita yelps) (Rita crying softly) Go. Go! - I love you. - I love you too, baby. (Both crying) (horse shoes clanking) (monster snarls softly) (monster growling softly) (clapping loudly) (monster screeching loudly) - [Ben] No! (Monster growling loudly) (splattering loudly) (monster growling loudly) (splattering loudly) (Ben crying softly) (shovel clanging) (screams) - Come get me! (Monster roars) (monster growling loudly) (monster screeching loudly) (Rita screaming) (monster roaring loudly) (Rita screaming) (monster growling loudly) (trailer rattling loudly) (Rita crying loudly) (monster growling softly) (door clacks) (monster screeches loudly) (screams) - Come on. Come on, please. - [Alan] You're gonna be okay. - No. Dad, no. Please. - [Alan] I love you. - You can't go. You can't leave me. (Mumbling) What? - Gonna make me a granddad. (Mumbling) Tell him I would have loved to meet him. I love you. I love you. Love you. - I love you too. (Crying softly) (birds chirping) (determined music) (gasps) (monster growls loudly) - Ben! Run! Run! (Monster snarls softly) (monster screeches softly) (monster snarls softly) (screams) (monster growls softly) Run! Run! (Monster snarling softly) (gun clicks) (monster snarling softly) (Rita screaming) (monster roaring loudly) (monster growling softly) (haunting music) (guns firing) (somber music) (wine splashing) (gentle chime) (glasses clink)
