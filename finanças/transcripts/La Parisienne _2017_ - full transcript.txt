I think it's you who have them, darling. Yes. I have not forgotten them at your mother's house? She pissed me off with her poodle. - What is there in there? - Equipment. It's material that we have... It's material, what. Of what? Our circus. - What circus? - The Morales circus. Moralès brothers. We start to turn around a lot. Klaxons -That papers then? "It's useless to look for them, Sibylle." I just realized that they are in the... my brother's truck. Gaëtano. He has the big truck, he, with the lion, the camel, the... the monkeys... Finally, all the animals. I have never heard of it. Your children necessarily. Children, they love it. You will come back to you. Listen. There, you will say "Morales, ah, but obviously." ♪ -This night in your city, the Morales circus, his trapeze artists and his famous Button and Pressure clowns. The Morales circus, the crate! - It's good, it's good, go for it. - Thank you. Have a good day. Button and Pressure, it tells me something. Button and Pressure? Where did you go to get that? In the memory box. Like Coït, your poodle. Ben, a kids book. Two clowns... inseparable. "Your clowns saved me from going back to jail." It is not false. It's worth a little signature, huh? I'm not fine? Where are you going? "This shop is all his life, my uncle." He sleeps alone in his brothel. He was the guardian of your weapons. In fact, you do not have a heart. Heartless? We kidnap Gaëtan and you, you think to do business. We, women, we are multitasking. The multitasking, she'll go up there and get the kid. Maybe in two pieces. With them, we can not know. OK. OK. I'm talking more about the shop. Do not let me down, Ramun. Not you. Ostia! There is someone? - Yes, here, deep down! - We are here at the bottom! - There is someone? - The door! The police knock on the door. Reculez. - Wait, oh. - Reculate! What did you look for? Nothing. I was in business with the owner before his death. A brother? Yes. Gaëtan. Gaëtano... It was the other, but the other is him. Gypsy stuff. Gitan of what? I am not a gypsy Moralès, it's not Finnish either. Your brother was checked in a stolen gendarmerie vehicle. It has no license. He said you had a circus. With 2 clowns, Button and Pressure. What is this circus story? Me, I live in full Paris, in the 8th. With an accomplice, frizzy blonde. He called her Sibylle. Does that remind you of something? Yes. So there, I understand nothing more. Ben, we do not either. They got married. They got married? It's not possible. They bicker a little, of course, but love is there. I go. Customers are waiting for me. You admit having sequestrated 2 gendarmes? But they were German soldiers. I recognize you. You are the little Jean Valjean. But is not it ok? I am CFO at Euro Market. I'm going crazy! It's the little Jean Valjean. We found the little Jean Valjean. Note it. Do you have a stamp? Miss Garnier's room? Good. That of M. Morales, then. It is the same? It confirms, then. Thank you. "Is not it right, my boy?" My brother stole a car of cops and fucks my fiancee. It's rough. The real problem is unemployment. It's stupid, that one, or what? Sibylle Garnier and M. Morales. Who are you? The husband and big brother. They are not here I go, I understood. Its good. Go for it. Humming Montez. Two minutes. I have an urgent desire. Go, me too. She is urinating. Crunches You could go further? Grunt Do not panic. It only attacks sheep. But I am a sheep. Raise slowly with your arms up. He will understand that you are a human being. Perfect. Go back slowly. I have to pull up my pants to run. Especially not. He's screaming in Basque. It's okay? Yes it's good. Shit, I farted my pants. What did you tell him? "If you eat it, you'll die." You told him that? "That's what the wolf shepherd said. Come on." Okay that's good. We can act. That is to say? You already shot? Yes, for stuffed animals at the Throne Fair. I drag them away, you blow up the truck. "Explode"? But how? With the rocket launcher. It's easy. You aim, you shoot. The. I do not touch that. They will kill innocents. You said it. - Yes, but... - But what? Here we are in the Basque Country. And when we say, we do. Go. But I am not Basque, me. I was born in Versailles. It's a nightmare. How does this thing work? Grunt I hope you are bilingual. If you eat me, you die. Ben, you're bilingual. ♪ -Alert to all units... - Who is this guy? - Are you cop? Spoken. It's a stolen car. On your knees, come on! You stole a car of cops? Is she the one who makes you so stupid? It's okay, guys. He is with us. We keep the cash. Always in the air. You have not changed. You neither. Not bad, for a bourgeois. Where is Gaetan? It is with Mirentxu. I pick them up at 8 pm Hold on. Here. I did it too well. I hope. It burns serious. Alarm - It's Ramun. - It must be with Sibylle. Miren, where are you? ♪ -Ben, with apples. Gaetan is with you? No. I did not see it. Tell me where he is. They shout. You are crazy or what? Stop, oh! Stop fighting! Is he with you yes or no? Yes. He's there. Gaetan, how are you? It is completely barred. Did you think I kidnapped him? My actions are political. Like trafficking weapons? Why are you with her? A French, in addition. She has a guy. Nothing happened. Ben... You do not want us to... I do not know, we... does a case arise in Spain? Go back to the hotel and pack your bag. - You see? I have it, money. - Gaetan? Hello? Let's go? What are you doing? Leave her. Rest. Stay with me. Take care of yourself, Aranxa. Ramun! It was my favorite panties. Ramuntxo laughs. What? But it's true. How about that, "Favorite panties"? Ben, she was very pretty. It was my favorite panties. Favorite potato? Ostia! Waouh! Go. So, the car of cops in the ravine? Very cool. That's it. You are a real Basque. You will never sell, do not go back on it. It's stupid, right? Shut up. Enjoy the scenery a bit. I can talk and watch. Let's calmly analyze the situation. Sneakers, it flows nicely, your house with. You have a rotten car, a shirt of... - What? - You're welcome. What is this misplaced pride? It's all my childhood, this shop. I did not have a father. Ferran raised me. If you like it that much, take it with you. It must be stimulated, surrounded. Did he tell you he wanted to die in his shop? No. - Cherry trees! - You have never seen one? There, normally, I cough, I'm choking. I am allergic to cherry, flowers... - Calm down. - I can die of it. Oh! Calm down. Look at me in the eyes. Look at me. Breathe. Here. Have you ever eaten cherry? Ah no, no, no. Sibylle, life has no interest if we do not know the taste of cherry. Taste. Its good. You look like you're healed. The beret is for men. Ah yes? Do you like your cut? Ah! Already? - No, it's the spleen. - Shit. No, I'm here, Olivier. Huh? But we will sign, I have no doubt. I'll call you back. I'm going back to a meeting. Raphaël... Hey, Raph! You're here. Thanks for coming. You come out from where? From nowhere. Here is the countryside, you know. I had a lot of stuff. Ah! Raphael, Ramuntxo... The nephew. I leave you with family. "It's better, I believe." How could you fuck Gaëtan who is only 17 years old? What? You're ill. You lie. I saw the old man. He is not dead at all. You took the money to shoot you both. Raphael, have you gone mad? Gaëtan, you scared me. Okay darling? It's just a crack in the spleen. You saw your hair? And what is this shit? It's the Basque cross. Where is Mirentxu? It's felt? - Have you raised something? - At this age, it gets up alone. Small con! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you. It is cracked of the spleen. Poor kid. Small manure! He fucks my wife. - I do not like the old ones. - Thank you, Gaetan. So you jumped who? The whole city knows it. Even the firefighters! Are you going to let me go, the killer? No one. He was with me What? But Mirentxu, my little girl, my baby... I would have preferred a Basque. Don't worry, dad. Gaëtan does everything to integrate. And I do what I want. - How could you believe...? - Sorry, sweetie. I'm stupid, that's it. It's this pressure, Olivier, everything. Where are you with the other? Did you manage to untie him? - A little. - I'll go talk to him. I will not let him cheat you. Let me do. Get off the luggage and call a taxi. I also do taxi, sir. It's enough, your winks. I'm sorry, but it's a knock. Good. I have to go. Evening, these reunions. I was not going to tell him that we had just... Hold, your promise. Signed. But... But why? I take my uncle with me. - And that's all? - You play your future on this case, no? And your happiness. - I just do my job. - And you do it well. You knew how to find the words. And the gestures.
