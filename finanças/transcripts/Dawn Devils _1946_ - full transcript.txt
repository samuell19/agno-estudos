DAWN DEVILS What is that rumbling storm? What is that sign in the sky? Is it the end of the world? Is it the coming of the apocalypse? It is our brothers, our comrades Singing together, in step The great parade requiem of the French First Commando It's the great, manly march It's the great, bloody march The great beat of men's hearts Oh Commando! It's the great, manly march Of the commandos It's the great, bloody march Of the commandos The great beat of men's hearts That women, Ah, women, never hear Commando! That women, Ah, women, never hear It is new blood Like new wine But not for the lips of women Tunisia Advance! Bloody thing! Advance! - Denis! Dammit, Denis! - I'm here, Lieutenant. Sound the ceasefire. What are you waiting for? Michel, if you turn that lighter on again, I'll chuck a grenade in your face. Come and see, lads! Look at your stupid face... Hear that? Shorty's acting crazy. I'll act crazy on your backside. You'll see, you mug! Come here and say that. Lucky you had your mascot with you. Otherwise... Calm down, lads. - Waterloo! Dismal plain! - Get lost, actor boy! Like a wave bubbling In an overfull urn Go, run, fly, And avenge us Blood alone Can cleanse such an affront Die or kill! Furthermore, I shall not flatter thee I shall give thee A man of dread to fight I have seen him, All covered in blood and dust, Sow terror Among an entire army I have seen 100 squadrons Destroyed by his valour And beyond that even, Let me tell you It is... Down with the Legion! Group leaders: Dubois, Martin. Attention. When will you understand? I've already told you: you are no longer legionnaires. A commando is a commando. Dismissed. Is that all? Er, well, Lieutenant, I have to... Lieutenant... Have you developed a stutter? They didn't hang about. - Was it Rousseau's STEN that jammed? - Yes. It's a Mark 1. Get him to take it to the armoury tomorrow. What were you on about just before? The shortest path COS 12th Commando The report should've been sent to COS 2 weeks ago. Overstretched, are we? I'm waiting for the boss. - Sir's off for a drive, eh? - To the office job. - You're not too tired? - I'm holding my own, thanks. And you guys? We were out picking strawberries. It was charming. Obviously. One mistake, but your writing is remarkably good. The colonel's gonna be mad. Pity he wasn't there this morning. I'll do it tonight. I have a meeting and I'm already late. Thank you. It's simple: did you get hit or not? My friends! My friends. Before putting up that offensive poster... You could have shown some manners. Manners other than those that exist here already. My personal aspirations, my penchant for deep reflection and a certain artistic sense that draw me more readily towards the gothic rather than the modern, towards the sacred rather than the profane, towards "doing the right thing" rather than just a nice arse. Where was I? In short, I'd like to move seats. Eh, "pet?" That said, I recognise that this young man is spiritual and distinguished. What do you think, Simon? I think that if it amuses you, you'd be wrong not to keep it there. The colours are terrible. - Enjoy, sir. - Thanks. I never get time to eat. You should get us a cook sent over. We're sick of tinned food. Deplorable mentality. You think only about eating. I need a hero, not a cook. We're respectable now. We're all you need. Don't get comfortable. - Any word, sir? - No. But they want us up to full strength. We'll hit Pop Poilu's bar tonight. He's young. He doesn't know. What do you know? He's demoralising. We can't even tell him we'll explain things for him. We'll find something else. It's strange you don't understand. There are all kinds of people in the world. For example, there are people who drink and those who do not drink. It's not complicated. Yeah. - He's not wrong. - He is. There are people who drink and there are freaks. That's true. You're a freak. Junkie! - Maniac! - Sadist! - He's inhibited! - Twisted! And what d'you think, eh, mascot? I knew the lieutenant thought I was right. - You're quite a guy, Simon! - Cut the shit! 2 years in the English commandos, 5 landings on the occupied coasts, including Dieppe... Golly, you've been busy, eh? Thank you. I get the feeling we'll be fighting over you. But you've never served. You've never served in the military. I haven't had much time, you know. But I know a bit about submachine guns and knives. I know a bit about Germans too. One goes in the other. - "One goes in the other"? - Yes. I've been in the Resistance since 1940. I've been in several propaganda units. I volunteered to be a saboteur in Germany, I infiltrated a group of replacement workers. Oh... It was just like any job. Well, not so easy. I left at a bad time. We'd just been hit hard. On the whole, the trip went fine, no problems. Got a light? Wouldn't you rather a Gauloise? Yes, I would. I haven't smoked one in a long time. Thanks. Are you going home? Yes. To Toulon. Toulon? I have friends there who'd like to hear my news. - Shall I take care of it? - Yes, but... Yes, but... They don't like to draw attention to themselves. Understand? I'm Claude Legrand. Legrand? Here's the address. Darling. Claude! Claude. You took your time. Aren't you gonna say anything? Say something, please! I couldn't remember... how beautiful you were. Forgive me. Put your jacket on. Enough of the games. Wait, darling. Let me see the others. I know it's ridiculous, but it gives me such pleasure. It really does. Mario cost me a fortune, but he knew how to tailor a suit. Hurry up a bit, though, or it'll be too late to go out for a drink. It's never too late to go out for a drink. From now on, there'll always be time to do what we want to do. I don't remember this one at all. Funny. It's not funny at all. You bought one every week. One a week? Let's not exaggerate. It's nice, but the material isn't as good as the others. It's not pure wool. Put this jacket on, please. What're you waiting for? As you wish. I look like an idiot in this. Hey, he was considerably taller than me. He was... I speak about him in the past as if it were the past. It's funny, eh? What's this piece of paper? Listen, Simone, I'm not completely blind. What is this piece of paper? Where'd you find that? It didn't get inside the lining of your jacket by itself. It's not a jacket, it's an overcoat. How foolish! I completely forgot! Give it to me. What does it mean? It's in code. It's too complicated to explain. A guy passed it to me hurriedly in Stuttgart. I must deliver it tonight! Really? Why? To whom? I don't know. A Resistance matter, eh? That's childishness. You don't know what you're saying, shut up. That lad put his trust in me. Give it to me, Simone. What do I get in return? Give me the jacket, I'll give you the note. Choose. Can't we just spend some time together? How can you still want... Simone? I hope you've made your decision. Yes. No, tonight. No point waiting any longer. He's had lots of time to understand since he's been back. I'm at the Proven√ßal. I'm waiting for you. Alright, darling. I'm on my way. Simone? Simone, are you coming down? Just a minute, darling. I'm coming. What do you want? I'm here to see you. Strange way of entering people's property. Who are you? Sorry, I've never been in the habit of announcing my arrival. But I made an exception for you. I wrote to you, saying I'd come. You wrote to me? Listen, my friend, I don't get it. I'm busy. The exit's that way. You don't have a memory for faces. I'm Serge Duhamel. Serge Duhamel? Stuttgart. The message. Now you remember. Try to understand quickly: I've got no time to lose. My pals are waiting in a car nearby and they want me back soon. What have you done with the message? I can't say. Did you eat it for fear of the Gestapo? No, no. The message got here. So? - I can't say. - I don't want no speeches. The message got here, but my pals didn't get it. They're rotting away in Germany. Oh no, surely not? Don't give me that! You're wasting your time. I could have sworn you'd deliver that message. It was destroyed. I'd forgotten about it. Did you forget the address on the envelope? No. You won't understand. What could I have said? The train left so suddenly. I forgot. I didn't think it was important. Plus, I was sick of everything. What about the others? "The others"? What other ones? The other letters. I've received nothing. I've been sent nothing. I swear by all I hold most dear that I've received nothing! I swear on my... Well, what? D'you have a wife, kids? D'you love them? You gonna swear or not? I can't. I'll be back in a moment. I'll be back, I said. What d'you wanna do now? You didn't get my letters? Not even the last one? You bastard! Which way did he go? Which way did he go? - Well? - Gone. - Find anything? - Yes. "Claude, "I know this is going... "to hurt you. "I'm leaving you. "I wasn't happy with you "and you weren't either. "You'll find another girl and forget me quickly. "You can start a new life with her." Then, I had some trouble with the Gestapo in Toulon. Ach, nothing worth talking about. And then, later, more bother... worse... on the Spanish border. Mind you, it was just like any other job. Anyway, I got through it, that's the main thing. Now I want a change. I want to fight. We've no need to discuss your credentials. Besides, we know them well. They're perfect. But our commando units may be called up at any time. We need trained soldiers, experienced soldiers. Those are our orders. - You're not going to... - Colonel. Sir, my platoon's 3 men short. Well, 2 men short, with Serge Duhamel. You'd take him, would you? Yes. We're old acquaintances. He's an ace. He's not the best shot, but he's an ace. You should've said. We'll see what the colonel says. That's fine. Thank you. Come and get your uniform. Clothes Store - What's your name? - Blot. I'm Dal. Proper name: Durand. Back in Paris, I was called Durandal. At the barracks, they call me Dal. They're always tired there. They do the bare minimum. I haven't introduced myself. Gaston de Chanteloup. Nice name. A bit long, but a nice name. It's my name. You shouldn't sit like that. Wait. There you go. Up you get. No fuss here. We call that place the job office. It seems stupid, but it serves a purpose. You're motivated and I know I can count on you just by looking at you. Hey, whenever you're ready... 19th Army Corps Lieutenant! Yes? - Where have you served? - 9th DIC, sir. Yes, I know. In civilian life? In civvy street? At Maxim's. Seriously, Lieutenant? I didn't come here to cook, I came to... To fight, I know. But not with your pals. If they find out you're a chef, I deny all responsibility. Sort them out and then go and get the mail. Yes, Lieutenant. Well I never! I'm a lucky guy. Listen, we have a bar: ask the sentry about it. The boys are there. We're having a party tonight. This way, lads. The lieutenant seems a good guy. Come in. You're tough. You recognised me, eh? Yes, pal. "Pal"? Don't get familiar with me. That's how I speak... to all my men here. It's the norm. You're part of the commando now. You wanted to trap me. D'you think I'll chicken out? I don't think anything. Especially not that. You need to understand something. What? That you're respectable? That'll be hard. But that's about the size of it. My men respect me. I even think they love me. The opinion of 30 men who've agreed to die at your behest is quite something, you know. They wouldn't obey me if I wasn't worthy. You don't get it? Too complicated. Light's going out again. I wasn't able to explain, last time around. Mind you, it isn't easy explaining things to a guy like you. If I'd been able to, things might've been different. - Got a torch? - Yes. Pass it over. Thanks. I didn't have much luck at that time. Neither did my pals, who were sent to Germany. Thank you. You can be proud. You know all the right words. Listen, you've gotta believe me. I came here to end it all. And then you perked up, eh? You're on the right track now. I don't know about that. Maybe. Yes, you're right, we're all on the right track here! Talk to the others, you'll get it. You've come to hold me to account? You have no right! You're wrong. What're you gonna do? The same thing again. What you waiting for? The opportunity. - There'll be plenty. - Sure there will. But that's old-fashioned. A bullet in the officer's back. Be careful no one sees you. People here like me, and you have a back too. But then, maybe you will succeed. Everyone will think I died a hero, in battle. I'll even receive another star posthumously. You'll be dead. That's all that matters. The rest... You're not keen on doing it right away? Maybe. This is childish! Why'd you stop me talking earlier on? So you wouldn't look stupid. They'd not have believed you. Who commands this unit? It's a platoon, not a unit. Colonel Lestier, at headquarters: where you were earlier. I'll talk to him. Serge! You forget you're a private. And he's a colonel. You can go tomorrow. Here's your pass. Serge! Sometimes, you have to surmount obstacles without understanding, without destroying them. At the risk of feeling like an idiot. But not like a bastard. What d'you mean? I've said what I had to say! I've shown you my colours. You think I've got nothing to show you? These are my colours. That ugly, is it? I don't think so. I owe it to a bastard like you, so all your nonsense... - You took your time. - Getting things in order? Exactly that. So, shall we go? Take a right at the village. We'll find it. "In response to secret memo, NDC 320, "training has been stepped up to the max." - Get off me! - Wasn't me! - Who was it, then? - Your sister! Hold his legs. - I've got him! - Those are mine! Leave me alone! Hey! They're here. They've got him. Where's Lily? - Lily! - She's in the cellar. Now's the time. - Lily, the man's coming. - If you can call him that. Hurry up! - Oh! - Eyes shining. What a figure! You light up our world! When Lily appears, a big round of applause, please. Shut up, Jaloux. Alright. I'll be quiet. Very funny. Hey! They're here! Right, stop crying and blow your nose. If I find the bastard... I've been here all the time! Open your mouth. No, no, no. Bravo! Our parcel for you. We're not dead, are we? - "Dead Man's..." - It must be here. It's dark. It's a power cut. It's strange, I don't hear a thing. Let's look over here. "This establishment "is for the troops' use, by order of Lieutenant Legrand." It's countersigned by the colonel. Yes. By Pop Poilu, too. Can't deny it, you've either got authority or you haven't. Lieutenant Legrand... Little Old Verdun - Caf√© No mistakes this time. D'you get it now, pet? Cute enough to eat. Leave him alone. Hasn't this gone on long enough? Give those French soldiers a welcome! - Come this way. - Where've you come from? France, Germany, everywhere really. Germany? That's where we're going. It's my round. Meet Pop Poilu. 2 specialities: good wine and good stories. Soldier stories, mainly. - Makes a change. - Damn right! Let me tell you that in 1918, when I was a sergeant major... Oh yes, I was! If I'd worn short trousers like you... Don't get upset. Gaston de Chanteloup. - What did you say? - De Chanteloup. - I'm from Venaissin. - What? The County of Venaissin. - Heard of it? - No. That's a lot of words. My memory ain't too good. D'you mind if we call you Mr So-and-so? I understand. When they started calling me Dal, I found it tough. He can hold his liquor! He looks like he can. The way he is now, he's nearly at his limit. Lily! Are you that afraid of it? We're out of white wine. I'll go and get some. What could you do? Try to talk about it. Then you'll feel more... Well, less... Coming? - Where to? - The cellar. OK. - Got a light? - Sure. - Is it here? - Yes. Thank you. Take the candle and light the way. She's swell. Light my way, I can't see. D'you mind? You are rather nice. - Oh! - Oh, sorry. Not afraid of the dark, are you? Do they call you "pet" because of the lieutenant? Yes. Plus, I have my own ideas... They understand nothing. You can tell me your ideas. I think I'll understand. I don't think so. OK. In the end, you know, ideas... are no big deal. Say, the lieutenant... Well? What about the lieutenant? You've really taken the piss out of him with this 2 bars thing. Who? Him? I bet he was the one who gave the idea to Pop Poilu. Some red, my boys, for a change. Tell me what you think of it. It reminds me of when I did my first stint in 1912. The colonel had the reservists called up. I was a reservist at the time. The colonel had the reservists called up... What's up with you tonight? Where have your voices gone? What? Cat got your tongue again? I hope not. They'll say it's me. Later on. I'm going to get upset. Say something nice and I'll leave you be. Anything... whatever comes into your head. Go on. I dreamt that death was after me: it looked like you. See... My, oh, my! You do have funny ideas. See you tomorrow? Didn't you fancy her, then? Say, old man... No, Simon, not today. What did you want? I must've left my beret at Pop Poilu's. You know the rules. - Happy? - You must be kidding! Telephone girl: not a great future for a soldier! It's not cocking. I was supposed to go to the armoury. It's fine. - I have my orders. - I knew it! A radar station in Tunisia. It isn't Berchtesgaden. But it's not a bad start. Where've you been? I slept outside on the ground. I don't like comfort. We've been on lockdown since 6 am. That means no communication with the outside, whatsoever, not with anyone. And I hope it won't last as long as it did last time. Let's recap. We disembark here and we get back on the boats here and here. 2 teams: Dubois' team, Martin's team. Neutralise machine guns. Martin takes north bunker, Dubois, south bunker. The 2 teams will use these little paths here. See? Surprise the enemy from behind. Attack team and destruction team under my command, here and here. Protection team. Denis, your list? Yes, Lieutenant. Sorry, but it's your turn. Operation timings. Any questions? We have to be ready in a ¬Ω hour... Why? There are 2 SS battalions nearby. I'd rather avoid them. - Only 2 battalions? - I know, I know. The guy who's going to blow up the station, where does he go? - Through the forest. There's no sentry at the entrance. It's worth the risk. If he manages to get in with his 15 kg of explosives, we may get out without a scratch. What's the signal if we have to leave early? A flare, 3 red lights, 3 green. Got that down? Say, the explosives guy: he's a dead man, eh? Not necessarily. Yes, well... Listen. I'll tell you something. I'll make you a bet. - I know who'll get the job. - Me too. - I bet you don't. - Same here... I bet you don't know. Lieu... The guy who... The guy who has to try to get inside: have you selected him? No. Why? I'll volunteer. You'll volunteer? Really? Everyone here is a volunteer by definition. Your colleagues have got a rota going between them. It's Simon this time... Isn't it? Besides, you have no military training. You won't be involved this time around. There we go. But it's only a matter of time. Timing. 00:00 hours: disembark. 00:05: re-group, re-formation of teams. - It should stay on now. - That wasn't easy. You'll be camouflaging your face tonight!? Tonight? You're crazy. It'll be another dead night. Tomorrow, maybe. - Finished? - Yes, yes. That's rather OTT. This isn't a firing range. Go and tell them. See? The magazine's fine. You're quite a marksman, buddy! Happy? Did you get what you wanted? What I wanted? Weren't you at the debrief? You're in on the job. Oh yeah. Let's not go over the top: guarding a boat isn't exactly heroic. I'm pretty amazed, though. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. Got a detective novel you could lend me? - What're you reading? - Poetry. You can keep it. Actually, I won't. It concerns everybody. It's called The Crusaders. "Queen of courtly love "O princess unsettled" Did we ask you to read? "The dying in the desert dreamt of you" Oh no, he's having a fit! Pay no attention, it won't last. "Eleanor of Aqui..." Ellie is full of honour... √âllie-honour, Eleanor Martin's just like me: he don't like poetry. Each to his own. Well, I can laugh, can't I? No point getting annoyed. Am I annoyed? "But not until they were in Syria "Did they understand "Those words" Fighting over poetry? Surely not? Especially today. "Today"? You were already told it's not happening today! Shut your trap. It'll be happening today. You don't understand beauty. - That's funny! - What is? That you can listen to that rubbish without laughing. You're here because fighting's in your blood. That's all there is to it. No matter what the lieutenant says, I am a legionnaire. With all due respect to the Legion, you lot could've been in it too. Otherwise, you'd have waited to be called up while you played marbles. There's only 2 ways of fighting: either you love it or you don't. And I love it! Either you love your country or you don't. Have you been away from French soil long? 10 francs, Serge! He couldn't have know. Cough up 10 francs. That'll teach you manners. - You're starting to annoy me. - 10 francs! Don't bother: you didn't know. At the start, that's all we ever talked about. Each operation we did, we thought it was the landing in France: the real invasion. So, we made a kitty. Words like "soil", "France": 1 franc. "French soil": provocative! 10F. After each operation, we have a big feast. The kitty pays for the alcohol. - Get it? The more money... - I get it. And when fewer guys return, there's more to drink. You get that too, eh? Is it true or is it not? What's up with you? What's up with you all? Trying to comfort yourselves! You're afraid to hear what's really going on. We only do what we love. You kill well, and that's a compliment. Hear that, Simon? Want a mirror to look at your killer's face? Our conversation don't interest Mister Simon. I asked you a question, Michel. You never answered. Been away from France long? Take 20 francs. What's it to you? It's been years. I left for the Legion. So what? Clearly, you don't remember it. What? French soil? 10 francs, Michel. Gimme a break from that bullshit! Would you know where a handful of soil came from? Maybe. Earth's like water: it's everywhere! Parachute blindfolded out of a plane: would you recognise French soil? - 20F. - Shut up! Maybe. Idiot. - How? - I dunno. By the smell. - What if you fell on manure? - You don't have to be right. - I'm just saying. - Well, don't. If you were right, we'd be happy. We'd discuss it openly. We wouldn't keep thinking about going back. If you make me think now, we're all done for. "The shortest path." You wanted that to be our motto too. The shortest path is the one from my boot to your arse. - Jaloux! - Yes? Have you got your book? What you read out earlier, read it again. - We didn't hear it properly. - No, enough! Don't move. Go on! "Queen of courtly love "O princess unsettled" "The dying in the desert dreamt of you" "Desperate, fine sons who crusaded for you "Eleanor Eleanor of Aquitaine "But not until they were in Syria "Did they understand those words "And mortally wounded "Realised that Eleanor was your name: "Freedom "Sweet freedom" 20 francs for the kitty, Michel. Like everyone. I put some grenadine in it. D'you like grenadine, darling? You were so worried. Now I'll be the one who's afraid. Afraid you won't come back here. Really afraid. You're so soft. Like a girl. Pop Poilu? Pop Poilu! Any problems, we'll leave on the 2 motorboats. We'll abandon the rubber dinghies. Denis, have you selected 2 men to stand guard here? Yes, Ducru and Ripo. Perfect. Yes? A message for you, Lieutenant. We're off. Pop Poilu just brought this for you. He said it was important. Is it tonight? It's tonight, lads. Fran√ßois! Yes, Lieutenant? Get the men to fall in. Yes, Lieutenant. - Where is he? - Upstairs, door opposite. - Nobody knows? - No one, apart from Lily. If anyone comes, send them away. Have you called a doctor? Listen to me! Will you listen to me? What's it got to do with you? I want you out of here! - Is he dead? - Yes. Lieutenant, let me explain. I was up there earlier. I went up, straight after. He was raving. He was saying... He was talking about the mission. He was raving: didn't you hear? The others teased him for that. They called him "Pet". - Did you like him? - Him? Someone has to take his place. That's all that concerns me. Listen to me, Lieutenant. He was just a kid. We're waging this war with kids. Understand! Understand what? A boy kills himself over a dame? It wasn't because of me, but because of himself. You know that's true, if you loved him. He was in a panic: he'd left the barracks. He killed himself because he couldn't go on the operation. I'm not interested in why he died. I know what he promised to die for. Ah. This is all very messy, Pop Poilu. I told him you'd fix everything and he believed it! He believed it? Go, Simon. Everyone's in position. Simon must've started up. That's Hans and Schneider coming back in. Simon must be in there by now. If all goes well, he'll succeed. If he's alive. Attention... 2nd watch to your posts! OK, advance. We're still 80 m away! Let's get closer, we don't wanna rot here. Not a good start. If only the lieutenant was here. Why didn't he come with us? - An emergency at headquarters. - Headquarters? Yeah, yeah! Serge! Are you crazy? We've got to put that light out! What is it now? Hey, you mug, why've you switched off the... Come on! Quick, get in the boat. Go! - Got a magazine? - Yes. Come. Get going! - Is it serious? - No. A bullet in the leg. Quick, lads! They'll catch us. Take mine, Lieutenant. Thanks. Simon had a bad time yesterday. So, I thought I'd... Well, I took his place... tonight. Stupid, eh? - What about Serge? - He's on the first boat. Who's that? The cook. That's the end of the good grub. Is it serious? It's nothing. Just a scratch. Lieutenant, Simon...? Yes. Lets' not talk about it. It's our business alone. Nobody else's. Nobody. You're holding it like a flamethrower. Pass it. - Hello, Serge. - Hello, mate. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Leg alright? - Yeah, fine. The boys are waiting. Serge! Careful of his foot. Careful. Wasn't too hard, was it? I didn't know the major would let you out. Even when you're a prisoner of the Germans you can get out, but doctors... Good lad for not leaving us. Here's to France and our next operation. What? They're left over. Michel is right. The leftovers are sacred. 14 August 1944 Right, then. Cannon, machine gun and villa. I don't get it. I need to see it, touch it. I'll use my hands. We'll do a model for you. Put your pipe here. This is their battery. It covers the sea. Only 1 cannon? No, but we have knock that one out. - What if we can't? - We have to. The Allied landing forces are counting on us. They were told the commandos are taking care of it. For them, it's taken care of. What about for us? We'll land here. We'll get there via the cliff and garden. What's this? That's their anti-aircraft gun. This is a fountain. Ah yes, the fountain. With a stone statue of a woman in the middle. And that's the balustrade. See, drawings are easy to read. Here's your villa. And this is the 2nd floor. There are 4 rooms upstairs. 2 of them are interconnected. - We'll clear them quickly. - Great intelligence. It'll be like being at home. Some of you will clear the ground floor. We must get into the tunnel. Via the tunnel, we can get to the cannon located above the ammunition magazine. Once we're there, a light application of plastic explosive... Your future revealed by the cards. - So, d'you understand it this time? - Yes. He talks well. Reminds me of my boss in a bar in Paris. He'd spend all morning telling you how to win at the races. - Did he often win? - Never. Is Jurieux in command? No, Legrand. They're round the back, I think. OK, thanks. What's on your mind? Denis, Dubois, Rousseau, all the others. They'd have loved to be with us tonight. Yes. What you thinking about? Jeanine. What about you? Funny, I'm thinking about Christopher Columbus. It seems he thought time dragged. It only took him 3 months. It's been 3 years for me, with stops. Two for me. Four for me. D'you think it's still there? It hasn't flown away. France, France, France... It's wonderful. France, France, France... - Have you swallowed a record? - Yep. This record's been spinning in my head for 4 years now. Four years. Dal! Serge! Come quickly! - See something? - It's crazy. It can't be. It's land! I thought it was... Aren't you gonna ask me what's on my mind? That's being asked a lot tonight. Did you recognise the drawing? Yes. Thanks. You're starting to doubt me again, aren't you? You think we could've landed elsewhere, not at my home? You're wrong. You always like talking. I like order. That time when you arrived, I nearly pleaded guilty. I almost told you I had mitigating circumstances. Since then, we haven't talked. Silence is not a solution. We haven't solved our problem. You seem to have forgotten what you did to me. - I didn't do it. - Oh, you make me laugh! No more past, eh? - Like in the Legion? - Not at all. Men enter the Legion with weighty pasts they can't shake. Here, it's different. The past is a bit like ballast: we throw it out. The more you dump overboard, the higher you can climb. What are you driving at? We've fought together, Serge. We've lived together. We could've died together. You've saved my life 3 times. Four. In Toulon, I sent Germans in the wrong direction. Why didn't you say so before? It wouldn't have changed anything. Fortunately. Dump the ballast! Believe me, Serge. No way. My life is out there. I'll find it again. I have a profession. I have good memories. I'll see my wife and 2 kids again. - You're married, Serge? - Yes. All the good things I've done come from thinking of them, my life, the past. My success comes from forgetting the past. We don't have the same past. We can still have the same future. - Getting off at the next stop? - Cut it out. No one's laughing. Did you have to bring this animal? Of course, it's my mascot. Did you hear anything, Albert? Go on up. Shit, I can't take it no more. There's no other option. Back in a moment... Keep watch! The enemy still holds the first floor. Keep 'em away from the gun. That's the sixth we've taken out. They get it now. Captain... Headquarters on the line. No, I have no more tanks or armoured cars to send you. You're on your own. Very well, Colonel. That said, we are counter-attacking, we've taken back the ground floor and we have prisoners. Serge, it's your turn to try your luck. The tunnel? No, impassable since the last bombardment. But don't worry, let their boats come... when the battery has to fire, it will fire. Oh, this is useless. I'll go and tell the lieutenant. Oh, shit! This has been bombed. - Well? - We can't count on the tunnel. There are rocks this big. - Where's the lieutenant? - In his room. Number 5. Try not to make any noise. He needs to rest. That's enough. Wait. - Is that a vintage writing desk? - No. Grenades. It looks like one. Let's all go out together, some of us will make it. What a racket! What does he think he's doing? Everything OK here? Good work. We've seriously got to sort out the tunnel. We've run out of options. The tunnel is our only one. If that bloody machine gun wasn't there... Yes, but it is there! Lieutenant, let me try to get to the fountain. - We can take them out with grenades. - Too far. Six of us can go. I'll take the best throwers. We must stop it firing. Serge is on the other side! - What? - He managed to get away. Martin, take command. Now we have to get to the fuel truck... and bring it to the villa... I need a volunteer... Christ almighty! Shit! Tell them to try the fountain. You too. Go on. - It's you and me. - OK. The lieutenant said "yes". Two at this window and two at the other. You ready? Let's go, lads! They can't even throw a grenade properly! Dal, have you run out? - What do we look like? - Sitting ducks. Shit! We're not gonna... All that work for nothing! It's ludicrous! Serge? Serge? Can you get out? No. All the tunnels lead to a central pillar. Goodbye, Serge. Good luck. - Smell that? - They're gonna burn us. Go upstairs. Tell 'em to go out the back way. - But, Lieutenant... - It's an order! - Serge? - Yes. What is it? Listen. Are you far from the ammo magazine? That's it! It's coming through. The ammunition store is just round the corner. That's it, then. - Their battery's had it. - Yes. And so have we. See, everything always works out. Yep. Goodbye. We'll let it run a bit, to make sure... - Lieutenant? - Yes? Ah, you're still there? Get out of here. Are you going anywhere? You know I can't do that without raising the alarm. Why? Who are you doing this for? I'll be dead in a minute. It's a waste of time. Nobody will know. You'd be better off keeping quiet. Have you no shame? You're right. Thanks, all the same. You're a good bloke. It makes it easier. Aim at the tanker! What were your kids like? Two handsome little boys. One of them will be going to school now. And your wife? Was that business all over a woman? Yes. Was she beautiful? Only on the outside. We talk about them as if they were going to die, not us. Fire! And on 15 August, at dawn... THE END It's the great, manly march It's the great, bloody march The great beat of men's hearts Oh, Commando! It's the great, manly march of the commandos Subtitles: ECLAIR
