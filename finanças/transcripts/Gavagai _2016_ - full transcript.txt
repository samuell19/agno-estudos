[TRAIN APPROACHING] [RAILS SQUEAKING] CARSTEN: "At last we emerged from the night mist. No one recognized anyone now. The faculty was lost on the journey. No one asked or demanded: Who are you? We couldn't have answered, we had lost our names. Far away hammered an unbending heart still at work. We listened without understanding. We had come farther than far." [BIRDSONG] [TRAIN DEPARTS] [BIRDSONG] Hello? Hello. Excuse me? Is there anyone? NIKO: Oh! Hi. Hi. Hi. [SPEAKING IN NORWEGIAN] CARSTEN: Do you speak English? NIKO: [GROANS] Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I speak English. [YAWNS] Do you know what time it is? Quarter past 9:00. Quarter past 9:00. Oh yes. [MOANING] Oh! So, you wanna go on a... elk safari? I want to go to Trysil. To Trysil! I beg your pardon? Hmm? I need a car. You can go down to Siljan and... I can't. -Why not? -I... I cannot drive. Why? [STUTTERS] Can you help me or not? [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] We are not any taxi service. I work with, uh, elk safari and beaver safari. -I will pay you. -Mmm? I'll give you... 3,000 crowns? 3,000 crowns? And another 3,000 for the way back. Yeah? [EXHALES] Why didn't you say so? Come on. Yeah. [DOOR CLOSES] [NIKO WHISTLES] [ENGINE STARTS] [VAN HONKS] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] CARSTEN: "Along the overcast road ashes after spent fire and signs of breaking up in dust and heat. Nothing else. But the blaze that flared in the circle of voyagers disappeared only to the eye its desire unquenched. They journeyed for a dream were ready to give their all intent on their quest in their unrest, and the bonfire flares up on every horizon, while fresh seekers poke among the ashes" [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING] So what's up in Trysil, my friend? CARSTEN: Sorry? [LAUGHS] I mean, there's nothing up there. The only thing you have is farms, trees, and goats. [IMITATES GOAT BLEATING] It's hard to explain. Yeah? Try me. It better not be anything illegal, okay? I... It's not. NIKO: [LAUGHS] Okay. Good. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY] [HESITATINGLY] Hey. You mind to... turn it off? -Huh? -The music. -All right. -[TURNS RADIO OFF] Suit yourself. [EXHALES] CARSTEN: "Slender legs are moistened in the night grass. Long bending stalks wake up with a start, and brush their dew against passing knees. A sweet secrecy. [HIGH-PITCHED SCREECH] Three light taps on the door, in quiet haste, in a spellbound night. A smiling mouth: am I late? My flesh is wet with dew, and fragrant, and my body a blossom turned to you." [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] NIKO: So... this is it. Have fun. [BIRDSONG] [LEAVES RUSTLING] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] CARSTEN: "Your knees are mine. And the warm moss. And our young years. Your shy thirst, like mine. And heavy like mine. God's eye in a sun ablaze. Your own confused in mine: Goodbye." Hey, man. Are you almost finished? I gotta get back to my life. [CHUCKLES] CARSTEN: How far is Vinje from here? Oh. [CHUCKLES] Vinje is five or six hours. Can you take me there tomorrow? [HESITATINGLY] Well, I don't know... I'll pay you. Wait. I have lots of things to do, you know. -It's like... -I'll give you another 10. NIKO: ...thousand krone? Yeah. Sure. [PANTING] I can take you. Okay. Up. Voila. [EXHALES] [GROANS] [ENGINE STARTS] [BAG RUSTLING] [SIGHS] [SNIFFS] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [RAIN PATTERING] CARSTEN: "The scent of all my summers is a wreath about my hair, is this all? So few and fast! So inexpressible were my short summers, with hidden sap and desire. Tonight the lamps flicker in the dance. My bridal night. The eyes of the room seek, wherever I am, and the eyes of the room absorb. My flicker is hidden. My foot is quickly wearied. My wreath. My wreath is heavy." [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SNIFFLING] [BIRDSONG] [NIKO CLEARS THROAT] Hey. [BOTH SPEAKING NORWEGIAN] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [BREATHING SHAKILY] CARSTEN: "The mouth is blocked by a heavy stone. The mouth is blocked by a heavy stone, and earth with flowers on top through pelting nights. But the great rivers run deeper. The rivers run to the sea in floods, run in torrents of floods clear and muddy, sometimes bloody. The mouth is blocked for words. The silent sea longs. To rest there. [PEOPLE SPEAKING AND LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY] [NIKO SPEAKING NORWEGIAN] [LAUGHING] [EXHALES] Ah. So... when are you gonna tell me what you're working on, hmm? [CHUCKLES] Come on. You can tell me. I'm not telling anyone. I promise. Okay? What is it? It's like you're kind of a... Lonely Planet guide to the most lonely shit in Norway? Are you kind of a whacko or something? I'm translating some poems. Some poems. Great. Which poems? Tarjei Vesaas? Tarjei Vesaas. Oh! That old bastard. I thought everything of his stuff was translated already. Not into Chinese. [MUFFLED] I beg your pardon? These were my wife's favorites. Yeah. She was a writer from China. Working on some translations. Then she got sick. Oh. I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm going to wait in the van.

Heaven and earth, what is one and what is the other? One has filled itself with the other at such an hour, through such a flow of sweetness. A fragrance one never learned about in all one's years of learning now it's here close to my cheek. And while the wet dusk deepens the paths on the water blur as if to be tightened at everything's end and the trees on the shore are not trees but you and I alone in silence, and the shore is no longer any shore or boundary." [ENGINE STALLING] [GOATS BLEATING] [COLLAR BELLS CLINKING] [MARI RECITING POEM IN NORWEGIAN] I'll go pay for the rooms, yeah? No. I can pay for myself. It's my fault we have to stay. So... Hey.

It's there where our road lies. The road. Our feet have crossed it before we know it. No one has a heart strong enough, no one has a conscience clear enough, to be rid of it. Sometimes we imagine we steer clear of it, fixedly we stare at our shoes afterwards. It's there where our road lies. What was it before? We don't know. It has a shape that startles us and sets our own sludge in motion. What will it become on our journey? We don't understand. Yet another rung down in decay? It is right here on our path and is the horror we seek, slowly transformed it its cold fire, with yet another rung down, yet worse a little to have stepped in." [SOFTLY] Polish your shoes.

Each time I look at you you open your mouth and cry out, but not one word gets through. Your eyes widen and read on my lips that I too cry in bitterness. At moments like this you press your face against the glass like a fraught child, contorting your features. Swollen and disfigured with want you lie close on the other side and the silence is complete."

Your longing to grow out of now, your great longing leaves too. Imprint of a girl's foot lightly in the ditch. So nakedly helpless. A spoiled foot a soiled body on the way to bathe in sun.
