A door swung open in the late '60s, and someone, something sprang up and slammed it shut. Nothing that big or bright or sudden had ever happened, and in so many American cities. Nothing so fierce or hard to grasp. The riots blew the roof off daily life. 1965: Watts, ripped apart by crowds. 1966: Chicago swarmed by the National Guard. And in 1967: Newark, Detroit, and 100 other cities, what felt like the entire nation. That summer, the people took revenge on the cities that confined them, retribution for a history of containment and contempt. A new force lurched to life in the '60s, and threatened to shatter everything. But that didn't happen. What does it look like when the state, the establishment whatever you want to call the people who keep things locked in place, is forced to face the consequence of its own callousness? How does the machine go rumbling on undaunted? A brick flies through a squad car's windshield, and the riot crashes through the night. But we'll be lingering on the cop car, and the pile of shattered glass. My fellow Americans, we have endured a week such as no nation should live through. A time of violence and tragedy. For a few minutes tonight, I want to talk about that tragedy. And I want to talk about the deeper questions that it raises for us all. I am tonight appointing a Special Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. Governor Otto Kerner, of Illinois, has agreed to serve as chairman. The Commission will investigate the origins of the recent disorders in our cities. It will make recommendations to prevent or contain such disasters in the future. But first, let there be no mistake about it: Crime must be dealt with forcefully and swiftly, and certainly, under law. It would compound the tragedy, however, if we should settle for order that's imposed by the muzzle of a gun. The only genuine, long-range solution lies in an attack, mounted at every level, upon the conditions that breeds despair, and breeds violence. So let us act, in the Congress, and in the City Halls, and in every community, so that this great land of ours may truly be one nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Bruce, what did you think of it? I think it was a great speech. It was a call for national unity. It wasn't a political speech, it was a great speech, I think. You all pretty much share that view? You know, I think he normally gives a pretty good speech, but I think this is a thing that you have to dwell on, unity. We haven't had very much of that recently. I share that- as far as it is, tonight, I can't say that's always true, but I certainly agree with Levi one hundred percent tonight that this was not political at all. I could see no taint of politics in it. I thought it was a leader addressing his people. I don't think anyone can say that the situation that's arising all over the country today is any one person's failure. It's been a failure of all of us. Governor, there have been criticism of the Commission on the grounds that the voice of the ghetto is not represented. Would you comment? Well, we discussed this slightly. And there's no reason why we cannot have even a voice of the ghetto, so-called, as part of staff. And I can't imagine a more preferable position to be in to be heard. One thing should be absolutely clear, this matter is far, far too important for politics. It goes to the health and safety of all American citizens. And I think the composition of this Commission is proof against any narrowness or any partisanship. You think it's a good idea to have this sort of Warren Commission panel of some of the biggest names in the country? I think it's a good idea, yes. My greatest concern is, have we asked the people who are in need of the program what their needs might be? We decide what their needs are. I think perhaps that they should decide, that they should be able to speak. This is a neighborhood business district of Riotsville, an area as yet unaffected by the violence occurring in other parts of the city. However, the situation here is considered to be explosive and the area is being closely watched by state and local authorities. The local police have assigned covert agents to gather intelligence and to report indications of possible violence. Joint military and police patrols are operative in the area to maintain order and to demonstrate the presence of a superior force. As a part of the precautions to prevent Riotsville from experiencing a violent civil disturbance, the authorities have made arrangements to prevent weapons and ammunition from falling into the hands of troublemakers. Even a routine precautionary measure, such as this pick-up of weapons, can breed resentment among the local residents. What are we looking at? Riotsville is a chessboard, a stage set, everything and nothing about the 1960s. Fake names and non-places, marched past by soldiers, doing what they can to move the play to its next act. Maybe it's a dream. After all, this is where the state assembles its fears, its cruel delusions, its tattered scraps of memory. So these are dream riots, the young men acting out the fantasy of conquest and invasion. What are they thinking of? Home? Vietnam? Do they feel something when they see a hammer smash a window? Or when the tanks come roaring in? When we asked them, they had different answers. Some said, "It was a long time ago." Many said, "I don't know." I'll get you. Once I get my boys, I'll be back. It is Sunday evening, December 17th, and this is the Public Broadcast Laboratory, an experiment in public television combining elements of information, education and entertainment. Tonight, from PBL in New York. and from cities across the United States a totally live and unrehearsed examination of police / minority relations with PBL chief correspondent Edward P. Morgan. Good evening. Do you believe that there has ever been a case of police brutality against a black citizen in the city of Newark? Now that all depends on what you consider to be police brutality. - I'm going to answer your question. - Physical abuse of a citizen in the city. Mr. Harrington, I interrupted you a moment ago do you have something that you want to come in with now? Yes, I had about fifteen things if I had the chance to come back and say them. Because I have a book here, Reader's Digest, which is a very respected book and it states that- Well, I'm sort of in a tough spot here. I know you are. But you're always short-cutting us. Now, let us have our say or we might as well go home. I don't think we're short-cutting you, Mr. Harrington. And if you don't mind, we want to go to Detroit, where I think the temperature is somewhat high in Reverend Cleage's church. Yeah, we feel that this whole program, up this point has been a deliberate attempt to evade the issue. Police brutality-everybody knows police brutality exists. For police officers to take our time, to waste the time of an entire nation, talking about they never heard of police brutality, they don't know what black people are talking about, they can't prove it. We know, in Detroit, any time a black person is brutalized by the police, he goes into court and he's arrested for assault and battery. Everybody's talking about- PBL will continue its examination of police / community relations after this pause for station identification. You know, we policemen are not responsible because people riot on account of not getting jobs. We policemen didn't send Carmichael over to the other side. We didn't ask Rep. Brown to damn and curse this country. But if trouble starts, we would have to stop it. And I say to you: it's only one thin line between crime and society, and that's us policemen. I want to go for a moment to Reverend Cleage's congregation in Detroit. All right, let's go. We are through with this white hypocrisy, with the efforts of white people to set up a situation that they can control. We are tired of sociologists and psychologists talking us to death. We are tired of police commissioners, and police experts, telling us that we're not getting our heads whipped. The black revolution is in progress and it's going on and we don't care what- Gentlemen, we would have been presumptuous in the extreme if we had thought that we were gonna solve anything. We saw society in conflict, we examined the hostility, we had some sharp exchanges in views. That's what makes an open society stay open. Thank you. PBL hopes that during this season of giving you will add your community-supported public television station to your gift list. We take this opportunity to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Tomorrow, the report of the President's Commission on Riots will go on sale in a paperback edition for a dollar and a quarter. It will tell White America what, in the past, only novelists like Faulkner and Baldwin have said so well: that the United States is a racist country. The report summons up an image that is more like the other side of the Iron Curtain or the garrison states of Latin America than our image of the United States. What we've tried to do in this report is to let people see this thing through our eyes and to feel it in the pit of their stomachs, like we do. And then, if they see what a crisis this really is, what a terribly serious crisis this is for our country, there could be a great deal more willingness to try to move to do something about it. It says we must take immediate action to create two million new jobs over the next three years. Six million new homes in five years, a guarantee of minimum income, far greater aid to schools than proposed thus far. A lot of whites might still have their bigotry and their racism, but they will believe this document and they will act accordingly to it. I think this is the important part about it. Buy your books on the Riot Commission! On the Riot Commission. At P.S. 151, where the pupils are mostly Negro or Puerto Rican, the school's book fair was enlarged to include a table-full of the paperbound reports. Throughout the neighborhood, in various ways, more than 2,000 copies of the Riot Report were sold in less than a week. 8,000 more copies were quickly ordered. Bantam Books, which published the first edition, calls it the fastest selling paperback since Valley of the Dolls. 700 pages, with 300 footnotes, based on thousands of pages of records gathered by staffers pumping out reams of surveys and statistics. The result was a pointillist picture of social collapse. The Commission had looked for a lot of things, conspiracy, of course, and the mythic "outside agitators." They found neither. Instead, beneath the data lay an obvious truth. "Our nation is moving towards two societies, "one black, one white, "separate and unequal." With those words, 11 of the least revolutionary people in America started to sound, strangely, like the people in the streets. In his last published essay, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote: "When millions of people have been cheated for centuries, "restitution is a costly process. "This fact has not been fully grasped, "because most of the gains of the past decade "were obtained at bargain rates." Civil Rights legislation had been a victory but it didn't force anyone to take from the rich and give to the poor. That was to be King's next step. And, thanks to a hundred flaming cities, that demand would appear in the report. The Commission proposed a program of unprecedented vastness. A call to raise taxes, spread the wealth, lighten the burden on the burning ghettos. It was a high price, but Johnson had called for a Great Society. What else could that possibly mean? What's going to be the answer to this report? What answer in the form of action in Washington? Here's Roger Mudd, who covers Congress. Roger, what's the impact down there? The one thing that struck me as I talked to these members over the last two or three days was that the obstacle, the stonewall that this report will hit in every committee room, every caucus room, every corridor, is money. And they ask how can the President run one war, with barely enough money to do it, and can't even get a 10% tax increase, how can he now be expected to run a second war? They're talking about two billion dollars a month, in the Report. Well, that's equal to what the current expenditure is for Vietnam. Sound 4. Is the greatest amount of publicity which your company has received as a result of Vietnam? Yes, this is. Do you consider your production of this gas to be a public service? We consider it to be a public service. A contribution to the order of a community? Yes, we do. Would you consider it something like the production of an automobile, or- Well, I would say that this is a humane method of handling difficult situations. Just like the dentist gives you a shot of Novocaine, before he pulls your tooth. Are you the greatest producer of tear gas? We are the greatest producer of tear gas in the world. Could I ask you how much tear gas you produce? - Or is that a trade secret? - That is- Scene 2, Sound 3, Roll 3. Are you the greatest producer of tear gas? We are the greatest producer of tear gas in the world. As one of the Commission's staffers said, "We could have tackled the problem from any angle, "from class, racism, the economic system, "but we didn't follow any of them through, "because everyone knew exactly where dissection would lead: "to the power and the interests "of the people sitting right there on our Commission." Among the staffers, mostly young, one faction wrote its own analysis. Their findings: that the rioters were like the Algerians, exploding against French colonial rule. "A truly revolutionary spirit," they wrote, "has begun to take hold amongst some. "An unwillingness to compromise or wait any longer, "to risk death rather than have their people "continue in a subordinate status." Those staffers were taken off the project. 1967 had given the establishment proof that something was broken and being born. But the Commissioners had to fight that view, obscure it. They wanted to present innocent dissatisfaction, pain without politics. It was rhetorical alchemy. In the language of the official report, a picture emerged of black life, poor life, in America. "Yes, there was hardship "and who wouldn't be angry about that? "We ought to pity the poor and their problems." But only a radical could possibly admit that the rioters might now just be revising their role in the social drama. They were trying to torch the whole script. So the nationwide rebellion was cast as a mere string of aimless riots, structural catastrophe, bad planning. All the while, young people went blazing through the city. I believe it was the system's way of handling it. I think it was the system's way of reacting quickly. And that's what we do in this society. We appoint a committee and we investigate. Ergo, something's being done. That's just simply not true. White America seems to be engaged in a kind of public ventilation, catharsis, which takes two forms, as far as I can see. One, guilt, in which many white people seem to be getting their kicks having Negroes flagellate them, in terms of telling them how guilty they have been. And the other form of catharsis is by increasing the hostility towards Negroes. And I think- Both things are happening right now. Both things are happening at the same time, and sometimes, maybe in the same persons. Do you think that we're headed toward an Apartheid society, Mr. Rustin, or are you still the optimist? Either we integrate, or the people of America decide to give Negroes a certain number of states in which to live and set up their own nation or they shoot us or the send us back to Africa. Or they maintain law and order in the sense of rounding or surrounding American ghettos with mobile and effective military force the function of which is to maintain law and order with continued inequities and injustice. Negro leaders, Dr. Kenneth Clark, Bayard Rustin and Charles Hamilton continues with part three in one minute. Welcome to Riotsville. This is a simulated riot in a simulated city, but as another summer approaches, it might be Anywhere, U.S.A. Welcome to Riotsville. This is a simulated riot in a simulated city, but as another summer approaches, it might be Anywhere, U.S.A. Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! Here's what I want you to do: You put 'em in office and you can take 'em out! Please, please, do not listen to false rumors or lies. Go home, old man! The police are not picking anyone up and they're not making false arrests. You're breaking my arm! Get off! Get off! You're breaking it. Take thirty of you- I'm not going in that thing. I'll be back. I'll be back, you rotten cops. Rotten- I'll be back! I'll be back! Chief, what will you do with the information that you learn at this school? What would you do with it after you leave here? I'll go back to Chicago and integrate the information I have here with our plans in the department. With the Democratic National Convention coming up and the threat of trouble, do you feel that Chicago needs this training more than other cities? Well, I believe that we do have sufficient force in the city of Chicago to cope with that problem. But, on the other hand, we must always be prepared for additional help in case it's needed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Increasingly, the computer is becoming a police weapon. Here, daily reports of crime are fed into a computer car thefts, muggings, robbery, assault, the statistics of violence. And then, the computer draws a map to show the city's danger areas. The program attempts to match the MOs of the known criminals to new crimes. The officers then follow up these computer generated leads of the most likely suspects. The 21st Century is brought to you by Union Carbide. The Discovery Company. Huh? Police Chiefs across the country will soon be inspecting the newest innovation in riot control equipment. This 20-ton, half track tank of "Witch Craft" designed to scare the wits out of any steely-nerved rioter. Tailor-made to subdue Detroit and Newark-type mobs, it comes equipped with bulletproof armor and blast window- Well- The new "Witch Craft" riot tank carries 15 officers, battle ready, if anyone still wants to fight. Oh, boy. Governor Kerner also warned against police departments. over-preparing for summer violence. In the event of an emergency, Kerner noted, an armored vehicle could be borrowed from private sources, such as banks. And in Chicago, a police spokesman said: "It doesn't take any imagination to buy a tank. "Anybody can do that."

Talk in the suburbs of tax and troops and terror in the streets has led her to the pistol range. A grandmother, fearful. She's part of the what the President's report calls the "polarization of the American community." With the little manuals that you have that were furnished by one of the shooting foundations pretty well sum it up. Maybe I should ask if there are any questions? Uh, like, combat shooting, where is the vital point? Well- The head. In this group, we don't really go into the anatomy of this thing, but you'll find that those targets are marked. They're the same targets that the police departments, the FBI use. Study the target and you'll see what they consider to be the more vital areas. Believe me, though, there's nothing more vital than being hit any place, almost, in the body. I think this is just a terrible thought. But if it's a terrible situation, and you have to resort to this, well then, the middle, some place. - Middle. - Okay? I don't like the idea of shooting anybody. I mean, I don't mind target shooting. That sounds like fun. But people, I just don't like the idea at all. But, if it's necessary, I mean, you know, you do what is necessary. Isn't-necessity is the mother of invention or something or is that the opposite? See here, one, two, three, four, five, six. - Pretty good. - So you didn't miss by much. No. In nearby Pontiac, an industrial town, a large Negro population is very sensitive to what it hears. They're angry and frightened. White people ask me why am I so angry? And, you know, I don't have an answer for 'em. because it would be ridiculous for me to answer him. Because he couldn't understand anyway. Obviously, because he asked me the question. But if a black legislator was out in the county telling black people to arm themselves where do you think they'd be now? If they got 'em to jail, - Before they killed 'em. - Before they're killed. You know, people talk about genocide. A lot of people talk about it, especially now. And a lot of people don't believe it, but it's a very real factor. It's a very real factor and white people are arming themselves to, you know, bring this thing about. Some discussion came up in the chambers of the City Commission and someone said something about 25 million black people. And you could hear a little mumble in the background, "Yes, and we've got 25 million graves." This is a very real thing. This is what they're planning for us. The footage of '60s rebellions has traveled a long way to meet us. and at least it seems to prove something. Here's a street, a face, a gun. Real things. Real and broken things, which say: "This happened and it hurt." But there are dangers. A picture can become a stereotype or be cleverly conscripted to this or that project, dogma, lie. Do we just want more or different images? Yes and no, we tell ourselves. Reminded of all those snapshots of chaos which swarm us and lose their meaning. The camera swivels to catch a cop car bursting into flames. But that's just one point in the process, a single fragment of the story. We wish we could see an image of a decade or a whole century working through its ironies, wracked by its explosions, but with all its conflicting features settled or at least accounted for. Revolution and repression trapped in a single film frame, one total, impossible picture. In Memphis, people were injured, stores were looted, property was destroyed, people were beaten by hoodlums. At least one Negro youth is known to have been killed. And massive rioting erupted during a march which was led by Martin Luther King. It was a shameful and totally uncalled for outburst of lawlessness, undoubtedly encouraged by his words and actions and his presence. When the predictable rioting erupted, Martin Luther King fled the scene, leaving it to others to cope with the destructive forces he had helped to unleash. I hope that well-meaning Negro leaders will now take a new look at this man who gets other people into trouble and then takes off like a scared rabbit. If anybody is to be hurt or killed in the disorder which follows in the wake of his highly-publicized marches and demonstrations he apparently is going to be sure that it will be someone other than Martin Luther King. ♪ Middle of the summer, ♪ ♪ Bitten by flies and fleas ♪ ♪ Sitting in a crowded apartment ♪ ♪ About 110 degrees ♪ ♪ I went outside ♪ ♪ The middle of the night ♪ ♪ All I had was a match in my hand ♪ ♪ And I wanted to fight ♪ ♪ So I said ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Nowhere to be ♪ ♪ And Lord, no one to see ♪ ♪ And now, nowhere to turn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ I called President Johnson ♪ ♪ On the phone ♪ ♪ His secretary said he wasn't there ♪ ♪ I tried to get in touch with Mr. Humphrey ♪ ♪ They couldn't find him anywhere ♪ ♪ I went into the courtroom ♪ ♪ With my poor black face ♪ ♪ Didn't have no money ♪ ♪ Didn't have no lawyer ♪ ♪ They wouldn't plead my case ♪ ♪ So I said ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Nowhere to be ♪ ♪ Lord, and no one to see ♪ ♪ Now, nowhere to turn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ I really wanted a decent citizen ♪ ♪ I really needed some scratch ♪ ♪ I really wanted a decent job now ♪ ♪ All I had was a match ♪ ♪ Couldn't get oil from Rockefeller's wells ♪ ♪ Couldn't get the diamonds from the mine ♪ ♪ I can't enjoy the American dream ♪ ♪ Won't be water but the fire next time ♪ ♪ So I said ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Nowhere to be ♪ ♪ And Lord, no one to see ♪ ♪ Now, nowhere to turn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ Need a concern ♪ ♪ You've got money to earn ♪ ♪ You've got midnight oil to ♪ ♪ Burn, baby, burn ♪ ♪ I really want a decent education ♪ ♪ I really want a decent job, now ♪ ♪ I really want a decent place to stay, now ♪ ♪ I want to live like everybody else ♪ ♪ I want to live like everybody else ♪ ♪ I want to live like everybody else ♪ We need a new school bus in this town, right?

Isolated and secured from outside interference or agitation, such demonstrations will usually terminate peacefully in a minimum of time. Now, an incident which will demand more positive action. They don't tell me what to do, man. I'm a civilian, you dig it? I put in my time in that Army, you know? In these staged demonstrations the men dressed in black will typify hard-core, professional agitators When the group refuses to disband, action must be taken. Now, the agitators shift their troublemaking skills into high gear, using the naturally contagious qualities of excitement and violence to incite them into action. These confrontations demand much of you. You must work within an atmosphere of explosive emotionalism and yet remain calm and rational. You will be subjected to the worst extremes of provocation. And yet, you must be guided only by logical thought. When every natural instinct within you begs for action you must remain passive. And when, finally, the preservation of law and order requires the use of force, you must exercise it with judgment and without malice. Why do you want to be a riot deputy? Well, I've lived in Chicago all my life and if anything were to happen, I'd like to help out in any way I could. Do you know, as a volunteer, you have to purchase your own gear and equipment. That's correct. You're willing to go through all the military training that's going to be involved in this? Yes, sir. You were in the Military Police, in the Army, honorably discharged? Yes. Why do you want to be a member of this unit? Well, I did this type of work before and so I like it. You're not racially prejudiced, are you? - No, sir. - In any way? None whatsoever. Do you believe people have a right to march? To march, you mean demonstrations? That's right. If it's peaceful. Go there in the hallway and see Sergeant Black, he'll fingerprint you. - Thank you. - Thank you for coming down. Do you see anything racial in the nature of this organization? No, I think having half of the group being half the group colored and half the group white, I think it'll be- I think this is a very good idea. Some people have said that this is anti-Negro in nature. Obviously, you don't feel that way. No, I don't. How do you feel? Well, a riot could be- it could be among the whites, just as it could be the Negroes. But nobody's really expecting whites to riot this summer, are they? They're expecting Negroes to riot. I don't expect Negroes to riot. No. The Chicago Democratic National Convention. The sense was mounting, irrefutable, this would be the TV event of the century, a catastrophic spectacle, and gripping primetime showdown. On one side, an infamous police force armed with every lethal gadget they managed to get their hands on. And on the other, the shaggy underdogs and soft-skinned campus waifs. Unlike Watts, these young people were white America's sons and daughters, yearning children of the middle class. Some media outlets sent their war reporters, others sent TV critics. And when the police started gassing students, and swinging billy clubs at camera crews, the stations got their wish, the tape went national, then worldwide. The point of the demonstration was to rouse the conscience of America, to summon the moral prestige of Birmingham or Selma. And in one fell swoop, bring the war machine howling to its knees. That isn't how the chips fell. Though some still like to say so. Something was amiss in the opinion polls. The audience tuning in at home, treated to this televised feast of state brutality, wasn't rooting for the kids, wasn't moved by their cracked skulls or slogans. The fact is that white America ended up siding with the cops. But another scene had unfurled that summer, further south, though it would be overshadowed by the DNC, the 1968 Republican National Convention. We've heard about Chicago, but we've been living through Miami Beach. Live, from Miami Beach, Florida. NBC News reports, the Republican National Convention. Good evening. NBC News is pleased to bring you the proceedings and some of the background of the second day in the third session of the 1968 National Republican Convention. It will help, probably, if I have a microphone attached to me. Put your microphone. Tonight- Well, just start over. They didn't hear the first part. Welcome to the second day in the third session of the GOP National Convention. How's that? It is understandable that the Republicans decided to hold their convention south of the Mason-Dixon line. They had not done so in 104 years. And it obvious why anyone might want to come to Miami Beach. But the real reason for the Republican presence here are less obvious. This nine-mile long sandbar has on advantage above all others. It is remote. Would-be demonstrators could be met by raised drawbridges and blocked roadways, cut-off except for the four causeways across Biscayne Bay. It's therefore easy for the Republicans to avoid the danger of large, militant demonstrations. ♪ Well, before I'll be a slave, I'll be buried in my grave ♪ ♪ And go home to my Lord and be free ♪ Now to Aline Saarinen, at the headquarters hotel. Things have livened up in the headquarters lobby. The poor people have come in, they have been followed not only by the crowd but by more Secret Service men than I can count, who are trying to figure out how they can get Governor Reagan through the group of people and are decided they're just going to have to just push their way through. And now, a motorcade of Governor Ronald Reagan is arriving outside, although most of the people inside are not yet aware of it. Here is the Governor, carried along by a phalanx of Secret Service men. He's a big man and he looks really as if he were in a football game. He's going over toward the room, the French room, as it's called. But I am amazed at the speed with which the Secret Service men can move through an absolutely solid mass of people. The Governor was looking very chipper in his white suit and I don't know how he survived. And the poor people are keeping going. They are interested, of course, in making their point not only to the candidate himself but really to the American people in general. How do you think you did this afternoon in the hotel? You'll have to choose to do what you can to help us out. We got no decision. It's up to you. We'll be back in just a moment after this message from Gulf. Here is an item, which has just come to our attention. At 1675 62nd Street Northwest in Miami, there is a large crowd of about 400 Negroes most of them young, conducting a noisy demonstration. There are reported to be twelve policeman on the scene and more coming to control the situation. The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of Senator Edward Brooke, over the seating of a lily-white delegation. The noise is loud, and the people seem extremely determined in their protest, so we're told. By the way, it might be explained that obviously these people are demonstrating because they are objecting to the decision of this convention to seat a rather small number of Negro delegates here. Here is some more on the disturbance in Miami. When the police pulled back from the troubled area, groups of Negroes gathered on the streets. Some carried signs calling for "Black Power" and others were generally just anti-Republican. At the corner of 16th and 62nd, one group stopped a car, turned it over, and set it on fire and fled. No one knows what happened to the driver. The Associated Press quoted one of the sponsors of the rally earlier today as blaming the police. He said, "If ten black people get together, "they call it a riot, "but 300 white people can get together "and they call it a convention." More from Convention Hall in a moment. Right now, a message from Gulf. Swat it. Hit it. Get mad. Or kill it. Yes, there are many ways to deal with a fly. But Gulfspray contains more pyrethrins for more instant knock-out power. It's available at your favorite grocery, drug or hardware store. And at your Gulf dealer. Played for as fools. And they're talking about everything else but the truth. We're being sacrificed in the city of Liberty City. That's what's happening to us. So tell the people the truth, and we can accept it. I'm afraid I don't know what we can say. I just want peace in the community and I'm determined to get it, one way or the other. I don't know what the means will be. It's out of my hands at the moment. It is my privilege to place in nomination the one man whom history has so clearly thrust forward. Untainted by war, dissension, lawlessness, or the threat of fiscal and moral chaos. The honorable Richard M. Nixon. It is my judgment that he will have them all over the nation, because the number one issue in this campaign is going to be law and order. I think the American people today want to do away with this lawlessness and they want to put down all this criminality and they want to preserve law and order. We can have no civilized society without law and order. And everyone is, of course, free to interpret the true meaning of that phrase however he likes. I want you to know that all isn't well in this city. That an awful lot of people better get about to business. You know, you promise and you promise and you promise- I promise my son, too. And there are times when he tells me, "Daddy, you either put it in the bucket or get off." And that's what they're saying now. And I am not a violent man. I'm a peace-loving man. I preach love. But I want to tell you this: You can't lie to people forever and get away with it. And this isn't to say you've lied, but I'll tell you this: You played with the truth. I'm going to bring ourselves up to date on the disturbance that broke out last night, David, in a section of Northwest Miami. Two Negroes have been killed and four wounded as a result of the violence in the troubled neighborhood. The Dade County Police said two men were killed in the mid-afternoon when police were shot at by a sniper. They said they returned the sniper's fire and killed him and a second man was killed when he was caught in the crossfire. Two other Negroes were wounded in the same incident. There are some later casualty figures here. Here are some more casualty figures in this disturbance. Two Negro men have been killed by police, four Negro men wounded by police, one white man wounded by Negroes, two Negro women wounded by Negroes, 32 have been arrested. Yesterday, the first day of the disturbances one man was wounded and ten injured, and 86 were arrested While there is, as we say, nothing of transcendent importance happening in the Convention, we are going to hear again from the Gulf Oil Company. When Frantz Fanon traveled to Algeria, in the midst of their revolution, he went as a psychiatrist. He found that the colonized dreamed of strength. "I dream I am jumping, "swimming, "running, "climbing. "I dream that I burst out laughing, "but I span a river in one stride "or that I am followed by a flood of motorcars "which never catch up with me." Thus far, we've shown you what reaction looks like, what it says and how it moves. A whole universe in which it's possible to stop the world. Flip a switch, and end the problem. Enforce contentment from above. If only. Just beyond this fiction lies the real world with real people, a place where things still happen. Just about an hour ago, it would have been totally unsafe to come in where I'm standing now, on 62nd Street, just west of 12th Avenue. It's not really safe right now, there have been sporadic sniper shots in this area. .22 rifles, there was several shotgun blasts heard. And the firemen are still mopping up. Heavy ash, there's a smell in the air of a fire that's just been put out. This is Channel 4 newsman Bob Reed, who has just come down 62nd Street. He's walking by- as you can see, some of the litter here on 62nd. We'll find out what's going on back down the street. Bob, what's happening back down there? Well, there's a sniper down there and someone has been shot. I don't know if it was a sniper or just a bystander or policeman. I haven't been able to get close enough to see at this point. Is it heavy fire, would you say, or? There has been fairly heavy fire sporadically throughout the last couple of hours. At times, it gets pretty heavy. Most of the shots are being fired by the police and then they'll slack off for a couple of seconds, then it'll get heavy again. Of course, you are in a peculiar position. You're covering this story, but you seem to have a good rapport with the people here, obviously. What do they tell you about why this is happening? Well, it's an interesting thing. Nobody can really say why it's happening. It's just the pent-up anger and the frustration and the idea of being trapped in society. It's a bursting out. It's a breaking free. It's- It's just a way of saying, "I will accept the abuse no longer." Whatever the reasons, and there are many different answers here, the fact remains that 62nd Street looks more like a battleground than a once relatively quiet street in Miami. They've aged strangely, these images. They draw us in and freeze us. What to make of them now, embedded as we are in the future they were meant to ensure? In 1964, before our story began, before Watts, before Newark and Detroit, a police officer killed a black boy. 300 of his high school classmates came bursting into the street. The next week would be known as the Harlem Riot. It wasn't the first one. The poet June Jordan was there. Later, she would write of lunging through the blasted streets, throwing herself to the pavement every time she heard a siren to miss the flying bullets. It gave her an idea for a new Harlem, a new city, a place devised for the possibility of human flourishing. The rectilinear cross streets had been a prison. She called them a "psychological crucifixion." This new city would be built on the bones of the old. Great communal towers would rise up over over vast green space below. She wrote to the architect Buckminster Fuller, and they drew up plans and had them published in Esquire Magazine. Jordan wanted to call it "Skyrise for Harlem." Esquire called it, "Instant Slum Clearance." She wanted it to be constructed exactly as she planned. Esquire called it "Utopian." Between "Skyrise for Harlem" and Riotsville, between futurist towers and plywood diorama, between possibility and repression, closure and rupture, parody and dream. That's where all of this has taken place, between two competing pictures of an impossible city. "Utopia," that is, "nowhere." Riotsville, Anywhere, U.S.A. In the book of Genesis, Lot's wife turns into a pillar of salt because she can't help herself. She must look back at the burning city.
