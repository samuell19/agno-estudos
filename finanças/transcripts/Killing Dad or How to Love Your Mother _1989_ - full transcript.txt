(melodic piano music) (melodic orchestral music) ♪ Like to be beside the seaside ♪ ♪ Oh, I do like to be beside the sea ♪ (Ali humming) (melodic orchestral music) - Mum. Mum, are you there? I'm wet, I'm soaking wet. You should have let me come home, because there's been an accident and I know you're going to think it was my fault and it was, I finally done it, I've killed Dad. I hope you can forgive me, because for so long I was a good son to you, trying to lead a law abiding life. It's seven pounds a pint.

(melodic orchestral music) (dog barking) - Ali, Ali, is that you? - [Ali] It's me, Mum. - [Edith] Oh, I've missed you so much. - I've only been gone one day. - Did you have a nice trip? Ali, how'd you get on? - I got the top seat on the bus from the station, the one in the front on the left. That's the one I like. - That's nice, dear. Well, I'm glad you've sat down, I've just made some tea. Did you sell anything this time? - I almost did, once. - Oh. - Nobody believes it works, at least they don't believe me when I tell them about it. - I know the tonic's difficult, but what about the spray? - No, no orders for the hairspray. - Oh, Ali, I wish you had the gift of selling like your father did. He could sell anything if he set his mind to it and I'm sure that's what he's doing now, wherever he is. (traffic rumbling quietly) (seagulls cawing) - [Nathy] My dear Edith. No, my dearest Edith. My darling, my darling Edith. Hearing from me out of the blue like this is going to be a bit of a surprise. I suppose 27 years is a long time, but it doesn't seem all that long to me. 100 years isn't really a long time, not when you think of someone every day and sweet Edith, not a day has passed, not one day, when I've not thought of you, not in the icy waters, not in the burning deserts, where I've travelled have you not been in my thoughts. To have left you and my sweet, little son is the greatest regret of my life. I've taken a suite at the Palace in Southend-on-Sea and will remain here in hope awaiting your reply. Forgive me, your errant, but ever loving husband, Monty. PS, we're not young anymore, but there's still time to claim a little happiness. (dog barking) - Get off! (letterbox rattling) (letters thudding to floor) (dog barking) - Oh, my. Oh, my. (melodic orchestral music) (water sloshing) (knocking on door) Ali. (Ali gasping) Ali, are you decent? (door opening) Ali. Today has turned out to be a very important day. - It has? - Do you want to guess? It's happy news, it's something I knew would happen one day and it's happened today, Ali, he's written to us, your father has written to us. - What does he say? - That there's something missing in his life. He says that to have left home was his biggest mistake and he wants to come back. - No. - What do you mean, no? - No, he's been gone my whole life. I don't want him back now, he's too late. - Ali, calm down. - Too late. Three's a crowd. (water sloshing) Three's always a crowd, Mum, I remember that from school. Three's a crowd, I don't want him back. - I should've known this would've been your attitude. Selfish, but I'm not going to get upset. I'm not gonna get upset. We'll discuss this later, when you've calmed down. (Ali sighs heavily) He wants to make amends. "I long to see you and my darling son, who must be a man now." This is a cry from the heart, Ali and you should recognise it. I've devoted my life to you. I've even scrubbed floors for you, remember? And I've never asked anything in return. Well, have I? Have I? - Alright, Mum. - What do you mean alright? - I'll go to Southend and bring him back, that will make you happy. - Oh, thank you, Ali. You know it's what I've always wanted. (toast crunching) (train horn tooting) - [Announcer] The train now standing at platform three is the 11:15 to- - You'll think the world of him, when you get to know him, Ali. All the girls thought I was so lucky at the time and I was, we both were. (doors closing) Oh, Ali! (doors opening) (doors closing) Tell him I've always loved him and we'll welcome him back with open arms. (train horn tooting) - [Ali] What you didn't know, Mum is that my Uncle Bill had told me everything about him, the real reality, not yours, I knew the truth. I knew things that you couldn't even picture, for instance, that Uncle Bill once nabbed him round the back of the pub toilets trying to have sexual intercourse with a woman. I'm afraid that's a fact and I've known about it for years. The man was a bastard, a liar and a thief, a cheat and a bastard and to my mind, Mum, there was no doubt that he would have come between us. I sincerely believed I had a rightful mission, but I knew I was going to have to use all my natural cunning to save our lives from disaster. (cheerful melodic music) (cheerful melodic music) (cheerful melodic music) (cheerful melodic music) (cheerful melodic music) - [Edith] He was an entrepreneur, your father, that's what it's called, Ali and I'd like you to remember that word, entrepreneur. That's the word for someone who has self confidence, that's something you need a little more of. (door opening) ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) - I haven't quite finished, sit down over there. ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) Ah, now that's finished, I can attend to you. I practise a little every day. My name is Margot after you know who. - Mr. Greb, can I have a room? - We are closed for renovations, as you can see. - I don't mind the mess. - Well, I do like to have a few guests, 'cause I get so lonely. So if you really don't mind the mess, I've got a room with a lovely view. - It's very pleasant. - Oh, that's a trouble with the seaside, it's so damp. The decorations won't adhere. Still, I don't suppose a young man like you will worry about a little thing like that. - Do you have a Mr. Berg staying here? - No, dear, the only Mr. we've got is Mr. Hedge and his girlfriend, Judith. I let them have two for the price of one, because I like to make allowances for people who are in love. Well, I'll let you settle in. (light melodic orchestral music) (case unlocking) - [Ali] It's all rubbish, Mum, him in his suite at the Palace. I've stayed in better hotels than this, when I was selling the tonic, much nicer, much more in keeping. - It's only me, Margot. It's only me. Sippy, Mummy's home. (case unlocking) (light melodic orchestral music) (door opening) Mummy's home. (door closing quietly) (knocking on door) Honestly, you leave me here all alone for hours. (door opening) Oh, I thought you were someone else. - Sorry to bother you, have you got 10 pence for the metre? - Are you from next door, the new arrival? - [Ali] I am. - Well, well, how long are you gonna be with us, Mr.? - Greb, Mr. Greb, a couple of days, maybe three, depends on business. - And what kind of business is that, Mr. Greb? - I'm a sales person. - Really? That sounds enterprising. Well, look, if I haven't got any change, Nathy will be back in a minute with a pocketful, 'cause it's past closing time. So why don't you come in and get acquainted? Come on, no need to be afraid. (soft jazz music) (door closing) There, that'll get you going. Thank you. (coins thudding to floor) Right. (Judith groaning with effort) Fancy a little nightcap, Mr. Greb? Gin and lime perhaps. (groaning with effort) I have to hide this from Nathy, he's terrible with drink. Shame really, he can't help himself. Do for us two. - Not for me, thanks. - Oh. You not the drinking type, Mr. Greb? - Not really, it doesn't agree with me. - You're not teetotal, are you? Young man like you? - [Ali] I'm allergic to alcohol. - No, (laughs) you're teasing me. - No, I am, I am allergic, I've been tested. - Oh, poor you, what a shame. What a thing to be allergic to. I wish Nathy was. Can I get you a hot chocolate? No bother. (match striking) (gas hissing) (fire whooshing) (knocking on door) Oh, Sippy. You're naughty, where have you been? Thank you, Luisa, you are a nice, Spanish person. Have you met Mr. Greb? He's our new arrival. (Judith blowing kisses) My darling. Good boy. Ooh, I think she had a look at you, didn't she, Sippy? Are you one of those men, that likes those foreign types, Mr. Greb, are you? - When will Mr. Hedge be back? - I love my Sippy. (kissing) Nathy's dotty about that silly bird. I can't credit something so small with having feelings, can you, Mr. Greb? (pans clattering quietly) (milk pouring) Cigarette? (drink spilling to floor) - [Ali] No, thank you. - Oh. Are you a non smoker as well, Mr. Greb? (Judith thudding onto couch) (Judith giggling) You are a thing of virtue, I've got all the vices. How's the hot chocolate? What you want, nice and milky. - Just right, milky's how it should be. - Oh, you're not going, are you? Wait till Nathy gets back, he won't be long. - I've got to get up early. - Oh. Right, well. Whoops! I suppose I shouldn't keep you at this hour, people might get the wrong idea, mightn't they? Come round again tomorrow, it's so nice to have somebody to talk to. Sleep tight, Mr. Greb, don't let the bugs bite. (door closing) (Nathy burping) (light melodic music) (Nathy groaning) (lighter clicking) (Nathy coughing) (lighter clicking) (light melodic music) - Oh, the new arrival. You know, I thought you must be, had to be. A new face. Welcome, welcome. Come down here, lend me a hand. (light melodic music) (Nathy coughing) (lighter clicking) Nathy Hedge. - Hedge? Mr. Hedge? - That's the name. I've had a bit too much tonight. Well, why not, I say, makes a nice change. So where do you hail from, Mr.? - Greb, Harlow new town. - Harlow new town? Christ, I wouldn't put that about. Uh, oh, oh! (Nathy sliding to floor) (Nathy vomiting) (Nathy groaning) Uh! (bottles clanking) Uh! (spitting) Uh! (bag rustling) (bottles clanking) There you are. Now I can manage, I can manage. - [Judith] Nathy, is that you? You're too late. (door closing) - Look, tell you what, I've got a couple of pints of beer in there. Why don't we go up to your room and drink them? (footsteps ascending stairs) (Nathy snoring) (bag rustling) (light melodic music) - [Edith] You shouldn't bear a grudge against your father, Ali, bearing grudges is not a nice trait in a person. So who are you to judge? (Nathy coughing) (light melodic music) (Nathy snoring) (Nathy snoring abruptly) (Nathy coughing softly) (Nathy coughing softly) (Nathy snoring) - Monty Berg. (soft suspenseful music) (Nathy snoring) Father. Dad. (melodic suspenseful music) - Yes, yes, (coughing) (light melodic music) Where am I? Oh, yes, Greb, isn't it? Oh. Must have been something I ate this evening. Yes, I had some of that Chinese takeaway. (door closing) God, I feel awful. Thank you. Yeah, well, you know, it was very good of you to put me up and if there's anything I can do for you, anything at all. (door closing) - [Judith] And where do you think you've been? - [Nathy] Oh, God. - [Judith] Waltzing in at this time of night. - [Nathy] Cripes. - [Judith] You cannot treat my home like a hotel. (light melodic orchestral music) (door opening) (door closing) (object crashing loudly) (glass shattering) I certainly will not! You smell like a wet dog, you do. (light switch clicking off) (seagulls cawing) (object clattering) (muffled Judith and Nathy arguing) (Ali thudding wall) - Mr. Greb. I was just wondering, seeing as you're on your own and I'm on mine, I wondered if you'd like to come downstairs for a little game, bingo? I feel really lucky this afternoon. See you in a minute then? Bye. - One fat lady, number eight, four and seven, 47. - [Judith] This isn't a game really, but it takes your mind off the inevitable. Hello again. - Six and six, 66. All the fives, 55. Six and three, 63. - Thank you. - Seven and six, was she worth it, was she hell, 76. (Judith laughing) Snakes alive, number five. - Thank you. - One and nine, 19. - Pen. - Two and one, 21. - Now. When he calls out the numbers, you just mark it on your card, right and when you get a full line across or a full house, you tell him, some people still shout bingo, but I don't like to, 'cause it makes me feel foolish, so I just say yes or it's me or something like that. We'll have to wait till this game's over first. So tell me about your job, Mr. Greb. - Bingo! - Ooh, right. - Four and four, 44, we've got a call over there from the lady in the blonde wig, oh, sorry, madam. - Do you know, that woman always wins. Do you suppose she's related to the man, who calls out the numbers? Right now, remember what's important is a full line across or a full house. So what kind of job was it? - I sell hair restorer, my own brand. - You are an enterprising, young man. Is it a tonic? - It's more than a tonic, it's a restorer. - My! Does it, I mean, people have been trying for ages, haven't they to find something that's really works. - Oh, it definitely works. - Wonderful. I'm not partial to bald men myself. Some women like them, you know, but not me. - I have an 80% success rate. - That's a very good success rate. I mean, how many people can say they're 80% successful in what they do? Not even the Royal family, I shouldn't wonder. More people should have that kind of get up and go, if they did, this country wouldn't be in the state it's in. Oh, I've done it! - Ah, we've got another winner on 77. - It's me! - But hold onto your cards, because like me, she might be premature. - It's a 10 pound prize, Mr. Greb. You brought me luck. Thank you. Well, I think we should call it a day, because we won't get lucky twice. So what should we do now? Seeing as how we've discussed the world of business. I know, I'll nip upstairs, get changed and we can go up the road for drink, shall we, spend my winnings? You could have something like tomato juice, something like that. - I don't like tomato juice. Could I have a ginger beer? - You can have whatever your heart desires. (Spanish guitar music) We're ever so lucky, 'cause they put on some lovely culture here, this week it's Spanish dancing with Spanish culture and next week it'll be something different. - Isn't that the girl, the one from our hotel? - Yes, that's our Luisa, isn't she marvellous? That's the Flamenco, you know. Top in her own country, she is. Look at these people, wouldn't know a bit of culture, if they tripped over it. Let's have a drink, let's have a drink. - What do you like? - Oh, no, I invited you after all. Now I'll give you the money and you can do it, I know what proud things men are. I'll have a double vodka. - [Ali] Double vodka and a ginger beer, please. (Spanish guitar music) - Oh no. There's Nathy, silly, old fool. (Spanish guitar music ends) (audience applauding) Thanks. (melodic guitar music) Now don't pay any attention to Nathy. Just pretend he's not here. So have you been having much luck, Mr. Greb? Business wise in the town? - I haven't really started yet. - No, just settling in. How does it come, your hair tonic? - In pint bottles. - Oh, like milk. Look, I won't be a second, just a quick visit to the ladies. (melodic guitar music) - Oi. You looking at my girlfriend's drink? - What? - I said is you looking at my girlfriend's drink? - No. - Well, that's just as well then, 'cause I thought you was and she wouldn't like that, 'cause I wouldn't like that. She don't like people looking at her drink, do you, Maureen? - It's a free country. - Course you don't like it. - Mr. Greb, you have behaved like a real friend and a gentleman, but he needs me, you understand that, don't you? - What I don't like is you leering at slags like her. - Who are you calling a slag? - You, stupid. (sniggering) - Nathy! Nathy, Nathy, come over here a minute, this man just called me a slag! What are you gonna do about it? Didn't he, Mr. Greb? - It wasn't him, it was her, she called you a slag. - It was him! - Greb heard the insult, it's up to him to do something about it. Go on. Go on. - It was me what called you a slag. (bag thudding) - Oi! (blow thudding) - Oh! (group scuffling noisily) Oh, oh, Mr. Greb, Mr. Greb. - [Nathy] It's only a nosebleed, be a man. (Spanish music ends) (audience applauding) - You behaved like a real gentleman. - Yeah, goodnight, old chap. - Night night. (door closing) (Ali sniffing) (seagulls cawing) (knocking on door) - [Margot] It's me, Margot. (door opening) - Christ Almighty, that's disgusting! - Poor thing's been run over. - Sippy? Sippy? Oh, my darling Sippy. - Please don't cry. - For Christ's sake, don't bring it any nearer, Nathy, tell her to get it out of here! (Judith sobbing) Don't touch me! (door closing) (door closing) It's your fault, you left the door open. - It's not my fault. - (slapping face) Of course it was. Just get out and never come back! - [Nathy] Chuck me out this time, I'm going for good. - [Judith] Just get out! (liquid sloshing) - Oh, off to work, Mr. Greb? - Yes, I've got business to attend to. - I hope you weren't disturbed by the goings on. He's left, you know, but he'll be back, I'm sure of it. And do you know why I'm sure? 'Cause love will find a way. - [Ali] Not if I could help it. He was going to try to slip off home to you. I was prepared to top him in broad daylight, if I had to. - I mean, woo woo, woo woo! You know, yes, women, what a lot of trouble they get you into. Now you and I have got to have a talk. Let's go over here. Well, I've been offered a sort of tour, but the thing is, you see, all my gear, the dummy and everything are all still in the room, clothes, the lot, I didn't even escape with a toothbrush. (case thudding quietly) - How long of a tour? - Well, a few months on the continent, then they were thinking about Australia. (urine splashing) Now, if I give you my key, could you pick a good moment and grab a few of my things, a suit also and Bertie, my budgerigar, the poor, old fellow and most important, William, my dummy. Well, I mean, grab as much stuff as you can, but they're the most important items, Bertie and William. Sounds like my family, doesn't it? Would you do that for me? - I'll do everything I possibly can to help get you on your way. - Good man, I knew I could depend on you. Times like this, we have to stick together. - [Ali] That's not exactly what I had in mind, of course, but I was more than happy to take his stuff round to him in his new hideaway, the Sea View Towers. ♪ Run rabbit, run rabbit ♪ - [Ali] It was the Australians I felt sorry for, they have people like him showing up there all the time, I believe, they must get sick of it. Nevertheless, I must admit that if he did go, I would be saved the messy and difficult business of killing him. As no one had seen me arrive, the opportunity for doing away with him was going to be more tempting than I could've imagined. (water sloshing) (Nathy singing wordlessly) (knocking on door) - Oh! Christ, you gave me a shock. - It's me, I brought all your clothes and all the other things you asked for. - Oh, good man, thank you. You got everything, did you, William and Bertie? - Everything, I came up the fire escape like you said. I'm quite puffed. - Well, I can't thank you enough, no trouble with Judith? - No, I never saw her. - Ah, not that I miss her, but for some reason, I haven't got anyone to wash my back. You couldn't do that for me, could you? - Wash your back? - Yes, you see, I have a scrubber, but I left it in the bathroom at the Palace and it disappeared, well, I'm not surprised, because it was a very nice one with a nice, long handle. You don't mind, do you? ♪ Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run ♪ Yeah well, do you mind, yeah, I've got a bit of trouble with me shoulders. Could you dig your fingers in, apply a bit of pressure? That's right, bit more, harder, harder, that's it. Oh, God. (groaning) Love this bit, uh, uh, ah! (groaning) Harder, harder. (knocking on door) - Mr. Hedge. - Christ, it's that mealymouthed manager. (water sloshing) What are you doing? Get off me. Tell him I'm in my bath. (door opening) - Mr. Hedge is in the bath, indisposed. - Kindly give him this, I'd like it paid now. I'll wait. (door closing) - Never paid anything advance in my life. - Mr. Hedge, this morning, I received a telephone call from a Mrs. Judith McCray, an acquaintance of yours, I believe regarding an unpaid bill at the Palace. - Greb, let's see these shysters off. - Mr. Hedge. - Just coming, I'll be right with you. Here, grab this eiderdown, it's got to be worth something. (cheerful melodic music) Right, let's go. Ooh, look at this. And, ah, ooh, we'll have that, yeah. - Mr. Hedge. - I'll be right with you, just looking for my socks. (chain rattling) Suspicious bastards. - Do you want to take all this stuff? - Yeah, but I thought we would. - Got the master key? - I'm still coming. I've found one sock, I'm just looking for the other. - Get it, Peter. (cheerful melodic music) (cage clattering loudly) (Bertie chirping) (dog barking) - Oh, Bertie. Bertie, damn. (footsteps descending steps) (dog barking) Oh, my God, he's dead. Oh, it's the only thing I ever loved, the only thing that ever loved me. - Oi, Hedge! - Really, oh, Christ! Come on. (men complaining) (cheerful melodic music) (seagulls cawing) (light melodic music) Ah, that's the ticket. What's your first name then, Greb? - Alistair. - Really? Oh, I once had a son called Alistair, probably still do. About your age. Bit younger maybe, and a wife called Edith. A family. I couldn't settle down to it though, it was boring. Everything every day the same. And a dreadful, little bugger if I'm honest, always balling his head off or stinking the place up with the smell of shit and baby powder, it's not a pleasant combination. All bloody good now though, in fact, getting back to Edith's become plan A. - Hm? - Do you know, Edith always carried a torch for me, you know. Well, as soon as I can get the train fare together, I'm heading for home. - What about your tour? (seagulls cawing) What about Australia? - No, that won't happen, my partner's flicking one off the wrist, he's a windbag of the worst kind, waffle, waffle, waffle. No bookings in Blackpool, let alone Australia. Anyway, even if he did manage to get it organised, I recognise I'm, I'm too old for all that rubbish. - What if your wife doesn't want you back? - What? Do you see that? What colour is that? - Pink, well, sort of greenish. - Silver, old chap, it may not look it to you, but that is the silver one. Now you see, what a man of my age needs is somewhere to put his feet up and grow old with dignity, that's priority number one. I mean, I've had it with hotel life up to there. Edith's my last hope for a blissfully comfortable old age and she could probably do with the company herself. - What about the son? - What about him? - He might not like it, if you go back after all these years. - My son, why shouldn't he? He's had his mother. Well, we can't sit around here all day. What about a burial at sea? (wind blowing) (sombre melodic music) Well, Bertie, old chap, into the Styx with you. Hey, Greb, come over here. Maybe I should say a few words. - I think you should, there's a lot to say, an awful lot, but I don't know how to say it. - God bless, Bertie, you were a pal to me. God bless your innocent, little heart. Well, dust to dust as they say. (suspenseful music) Oh and Greb, I don't hold Bertie's demise against you. Budgies have a pretty short lifespan anyway. (melodic guitar music) (seagulls cawing) Oh, hello, Judith. Greb. - Hello, Nathy. I've been looking for you. Good afternoon, Mr. Greb. I've had a visit from a policeman about a very serious matter. Perhaps we should have a little talk. Hope you didn't aid and abet Mr. Hedge in his petty crime, Mr. Greb. - Not much. - Not much, it was his idea in the first place. - Nathy Hedge, I know your little trademarks and this is one of them. You and I are gonna have a serious talk, come on. We're having a party, Guy Fawkes, come along. Bring a friend and a bottle or two. - [Ali] I can't understand what he was doing writing letters to you in the first place, Mum, when he had Judith there. He was very fortunate to have her, because she knew just how to keep him under control. It's a mystery to me what you women see in a man like that, as far as I could make out, the best thing for him would have been to marry her and not bother us at all. Killing him was proving to be more difficult than I had supposed, although I'd never expected it to be easy. In spite of my three failures, I wasn't going to give up, but I was beginning to think I might have a problem. (cards shuffling) - Pick a card. - No, thank you. - What were you doing? - Nothing. - No, it's okay, I don't go to the policia, but I see you. - I didn't do anything. (footsteps ascending stairs) - Hey, Mr. Greb, is Mr. Hedge your father? (Spanish guitar music) It's okay to kill some people, but if you kill your father, you sleep with your mother. - [Ali] I'll put that remark down to the fact, that she's a foreigner.

Never happy unless you've got someone to sneer at. - [William] Certainly no spring chicken. (Judith slapping face) - [Nathy] It wasn't me, for Christ's sake. - [William] It was me, you stupid cow. (blow thudding) - I've had it with this thing. We were having a nice time, but you had to spoil it. Who had to spoil it? - Only a little joke. (door closing) - It was very amusing, wasn't it, Mr. Greb? (door closing) He's only happy when he's got somebody to sneer at. Well, say goodbye to William, Nathy, say goodbye. - No, give, give him, give me him back, give him back. - Oh, look, Nathy, look, look, look, Nathy, look. Look, he's about as useless as you are, isn't he? Say goodbye! (door opening) - What you doing now? - I don't know. - I'm sure I do. - It weren't nothing anyway. - [Judith] Catch! - Oi, what the?

Damn you both if I don't get on a train and go back to Edith tomorrow. (soft suspenseful music) - [Ali] That was the last straw. Although I felt sorry for him, I had to do what I had to do. - [Margot] Oh, I'm glad you found him, Mr. Hedge. - [Ali] I had been as reasonable as I possibly could in all this, I had. If the truth be known, I think he was begging me to kill him. You have to understand that, Mum. (door opening) (door opening) (knocking on door) (door opening) - Mr. Greb, you're back, what happened, did you find Nathy? - No. Yes, he went down the pub. - We were having such a nice time, I'm so sorry it was spoiled.

("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) (door opening) (soft jazz music) (door closing) - I found another, you cheeky, you and I'm feeling better. - Let me have some of it. - I thought you were allergic. Need a little Dutch courage? Not very flattering. (Ali coughing) Oh, go easy, if you're not used to it, it can go straight to your head, you know. Perhaps you should have a hot chocolate instead. - I don't need a hot chocolate. Make them milky, having them milky. - Well, come and lie down and put your head in my lap. (Ali thudding into door) - I'm not feeling very well. - Oh, be nice, Mr. Greb. And I so wanted the evening to end well. (door closing) (floorboards creaking) (soft suspenseful music) - [Edith] A clean living, young man, your father was, not religious, but he was more Christian than a lot of churchgoers I could mention.

Do you know, all that bother last night was Nathy being jealous of you? - It wasn't. - It's true. (bottles clattering down stairs) Oh! Poofy woofy, what is that? - It's hair restorer. - Oh yes, you told me, that's when I first thought how enterprising you were. Oh, now, now don't put them in without wiping them first, you'll stink the place up. Ooh, I'll just go and put these in the bin, I will. (footsteps ascending stairs) (dramatic guitar music) Ooh, that does smell. (water running) Come and wash your hands. That's it, ooh! That's better, nice and clean. It's real, very real. You know that, don't you, that something between us? Don't go, not just when things are beginning to happen. Anyway, you've forgotten something, you silly you, how'd you think you're gonna go on with just one shoe? - I killed him. - Oh! God, it's Nathy. - I had to. - You didn't. - I had to. - Oh, Nathy, oh, my sweet, my poor, poor darling. Is he really dead? - I strangled him last night. - You strangled him? - Shh! - You didn't have to strangle him. - Shh, as long as he was alive, we'd never be free of him. I had to. - We, Ali, did you say we, you and I? (light melodic music) Oh, I knew it. Oh, but such an act, oh. You heard all those terrible things he said to me. Oh, my darling, of course I understand. My God, what passion. A crime of passion. My darling. Oh, Ali, it was, wasn't it, love at first sight? - We've got to get rid of him. - Yes, Ali, yes, but not right now. - I don't like him being here. - Well, I would imagine it is a little kinky, us making love with Nathy under the bed, but- - We've got to get rid of him. - Oh, you are a sensitive one, aren't you? Alright, we'll dump Nathy and then we'll go, fly away, somewhere foreign, South America? No, South Africa, no, the South of France! - Shh! - Shh, shh! - I need something to tie the carpet. - I've got something, my belt. I deserve it though, don't I, Ali? I've had an unhappy life until now, so I deserve it, don't I? (cheerful melodic music) Oh, careful. Careful, not too- - [Ali] They say that when a man's father dies, he feels some sense of loss. I felt wonderful. Still, I was a little anxious that Judith had got quite so carried away with the whole idea. I hadn't meant to mislead her, but I obviously had done something to get her going. (cheerful melodic music) - Hello there, where you going wih that then? - Moving house? - We're just taking the carpet to be cleaned. - [Ernie] Hey, well, give us a bit before you go then. (all jeering rowdily) - Get off! Get off me! - Go on, you old tosser. - Alright, darling? - Ooh! - You should be on a youth training scheme, you should. - I'm on one. - He's a childminder. - [Terry] Yeah. - Not bad though, ey, Tel? - No, mate. (Ali breathing heavily) - Can I leave some luggage? - That looks like a heavy one. You'd better bring it round here. (door opening) Ooh! (Ali groaning) - Where'd you want it? - Put it up on the rack. (objects clattering) How long do you want to leave it? - Long. - Well, how long? - Longer. (running footsteps) The messy part was over, thank God. At last I was free. - Mr. Jeffries. I think we've got another one of those special carpets. - [Ali] In order to dump Judith, I would have to tell a little lie, but I wanted to say my goodbyes to you. Course, I had no intention of coming back for her. I wanted to be with you, Mum, not go running off to some foreign country. - You promised me a new life, I wanna go now. Don't wanna sit here and wait, while you go home, it's not fair. Why can't I come, I'm nothing to be ashamed of, am I? - Course not. - Well, why don't you want me to come then? - It's just my mum might not think you're a suitable friend for me, that's all. - Oh, my God. It's not that, is it? (light melodic music) This always happens to me. Men think I'm desperate, so I put them off, happens every time, every time I find someone I like, I drive them away, because I'm so desperate. Why don't men like my type of woman? We mean so well. (sobbing) - Have you got any biscuits? - There's nothing wrong with being keen, is there, Ali? Is there? I just want someone to love, (blowing nose) and someone to love me back. Nothing wrong with that, is there? - Course not. (Judith blowing nose) I'm hungry. - Oh, are you? - Have you got any biscuits? - Let's go out to a restaurant. Oh, I'd love to go out to a restaurant, Ali. Nathy was always too tight to take me out. He'd make me fry every meal here. (blowing nose) (light melodic music) You will make me happy, won't you, Ali? I don't want much out of life, just a little bit of happiness. Everyone deserves that. (Judith blowing nose) ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) Mr. Greb is taking me to dinner at Michelle's. - That's terribly expensive. - I know. ("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" by Tchaikovsky) (speaking in foreign language) - Enjoy your meal. - He's another Spanish person. She's pretty, that waitress, don't you think? I was testing you. I'm pleased you're not interested in other women, Nathy would've been eyeing her up all night. - Even with you sitting here? - Especially with me sitting here, but don't let's talk about him, except how warm was the left luggage office? - How warm? - Was it heated? - I don't know. It was a little bit warm, I think. - It's a practical matter to consider, you see, if it was warm, Nathy's gonna start to pong quicker. Bodies do, you know, they really start to smell after a bit, same when fish goes off. - There may have been a gas fire. I remember it now, there was a gas fire. - All the more reason to leave as soon as poss. - Mrs. McCray. (sliding door closing) Mr. Hedge gave me this letter for you, I forgot to give it to you, so I thought I'd bring it straight away, 'cause I know how you feel about him in your heart. - No, Mr. Hedge has left, he's gone away. - But I'm sure he'll be back. (paper rustling) - What, when did Mr. Hedge give you this? - This morning on his way out. - Mr. Hedge, my Mr. Hedge, my Nathy? - Of course, your Nathy. - What is going on? What do you think you're playing at? You say you actually saw Mr. Hedge this morning with your own eyes? - Dear, he was talking to me like I'm talking to you. - What have you got to say for yourself? (chair scraping floor) This is private, if you don't mind. - Oh. (chair scraping floor) Excuse me. - Is this some kind of cruel joke cooked up by you and Nathy? Ey, to pretend he's dead? - It must be an old one, it must be an old letter. - It's got today's date on it and he says it's because of you that he's leaving me for good. - [Ali] There must be some explanation. - It's not Nathy. Oh my God, oh no, I'm not getting mixed up in this. A whole pack, I'm not getting mixed up in this. (door sliding open) A crime of passion is one thing, but I'm not breaking bread with an ordinary murderer. - I killed him, I swear I killed him. I took his neck like this and squeezed and squeezed and squeezed. - Oh, my God, I'm not getting mixed up in this. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh. Thank you! - [Judith] Murderer! If it wasn't Nathy, you must have killed an innocent bystander, you murderer! It might even have been one of the wild men, poor sod! (cabinet clanking) (soft suspenseful music) (footsteps running) (suspenseful music) (door banging) - Can I help you, sir? - There was old man of Devizes with balls of different sizes. - [Mr. Jeffries] And the one which was small was no good at all and the other won various prizes. - One was small, no good at all, other one various prizes. (Mr. Jeffries laughing) (Mr. Jeffries applauding) - Pretty good, isn't she? Pity about the accident. - This is the gentleman, that owns the little chap. - [Mr. Jeffries] Come on, show us how it's done. - I'm glad it's not your father. - [Announcer] Approaching platform two is the 3:15 from Tenby. - Bye, Mr. Greb. - [Ali] Are you leaving? - Yes, I dance one week here, now I go. Do you want to come with me? (eerie melodic music) - Where are you going? - Somewhere else? - Where else? - I don't know where, a place called Broadstairs, I think. - I couldn't do a thing like that, I've got a job. - Hm, hair tonic. Judith tell me. - I don't like hair tonic. I don't like barbershops. I will come with you. (doors opening) - Ali, how did you know I was coming? What's this? Oh, hello, dear, are you a friend of Ali's? I'm Ali's mother. - Yes, I'm a friend of Ali's. Well, (kissing cheek) I hope in Broadstairs, Mr. Greb. Bye bye. - Goodbye. (birds chirping) Ali. Did you find him? Ali, where's your father? - I don't know, Mum. - Isn't he at the hotel? - [Ali] No, Mum, he's not. - [Edith] He's not? Where is he then? - [Diego] Adios! (train rumbling) (seagulls cawing) - Well, this could do with a little cheering up and there's not even a carpet. - Shh! - Why? - My neighbours are asleep. - At this hour? - They work late. - What I need is a cup of tea and a few moments to collect our thoughts about what we do. - We should go home. - Oh, I'm not gonna give up that easily. He must be here somewhere, dear and I'm gonna search until I find him. - You can rot in prison for all I care. Men are such swines. Well, it's the last time. (door opening) And as for you, you're a bloody murderer. Why couldn't you have done in Nathy? - I never killed anyone, not Nathy nor anyone else. - Tell it to the judge, I saw his foot, you liar. - It was Nathy's dummy. - Who? - I rolled him up in the carpet. - You did what? - I must've been drunk. I rolled him up, I thought it was him, but it was the dummy. I was drinking and I'm allergic. - All that fuss and all you did was wrap his dummy up in the carpet? Really and truly? - Cross my heart and hope to die. - You silly boy. You thought that was Nathy? I've got to admit, I'm a bit relieved. At least you haven't murdered, it's one of the 10 Commandments. You don't have to kill him, I will never take him back, I promise. - You don't understand. - I do, I do, I do. He can get down on bended knee and beg, but I will never take him back. (door opening) (knocking on door) Hello, new arrival, are you? - Mum. - Mum? Oh, I think I'm blushing. - Mum, there's someone I'd like to introduce you to, this is Judith from next door. - Ever so pleased to meet you. Your son has been such a comfort to me over a little domestic trouble I've been suffering. - He's a good boy, Ali, I took a lot of trouble to make sure he turned out a nice boy. Ali. - Well, he really did. (bottles clanking) (door closing) (mellow melodic music) - [Ali] I didn't care anymore about Dad, but with you out there looking, I realised how much you must've loved him. I should never have interfered, I'm very sorry. (traffic rumbling quietly) I wish I'd run away on that train with Luisa. I felt everything was going wrong, not just in my life, but in love as well. (door opening) (light melodic music) (door closing) (Ali humming) (teacup clattering quietly) - Ali. Suppose he's gone home? He's gone looking for me at home and I'm not there. I'm here, that would be terrible, that would be like Shakespeare. (Ali humming) Ali, I've got to go home just in case. - Hello, I was just wondering if you'd like some hot food after all your walking, I bought this. It says on the label it's better than a square meal and I've got six French fancies, I bet you'd like that, Ali. - It's very kind of you, but we've had our tea and we're having a private conversation. - Oh, right, right then. well, perhaps I'll see you later, Ali. I'll save a tin for later, okay. (door closing) - Would you stay on here a few more days just in case and I'll go home. - I want to come home too, Mum. Please don't leave me behind, I want to come home too. - Oh please, it's your father, just a few more days. It seems such a pity to give up after all this. Some men just aren't suited for family life and I think he was one of those. And Ali, that woman at the hotel, have as little to do with her as you can, I don't think she's a suitable friend for you. Thank you. - Thank you, madam. (cheerful melodic music) (knocking on door) - Greb. Greb, old chap, are you there? Greb, did I leave William in there? I'm pretty sure I left him there the other night, have you seen him? (doorknob rattling) (knocking on door) Greb, look, it's of the utmost bloody importance I find him. You see, old Larry down at the pub's offered me 25 quid to entertain the regulars, so I've got to find him. Greb. - [Ali] Go away. - I never did like you, a sight too smarmy for my taste, matey. (seagulls cawing) (birds chirping) - I know how to look after a man, Ali, it's what I'm best at and I can look after you. Come and sit down. Here we are. - Psst, come on. (mellow melodic music) Come on. (Ernie tripping to floor) (footsteps ascending stairs) (knocking on door) Greb, you twit, where is he? Where is William?

I just want our lives to go back to being the same as they were before. Mum, please, please, Mum. Mum. - I can't bear dead things.
