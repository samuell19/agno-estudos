23.976 English Closed Caption DVD Subrip NTSC ? 09.11.2019 2,800 square-feet. Four bedrooms. Two and a half baths. Quiet street, great schools, close to shopping... Betsy! You told Jackson that you'd be to work early this morning. I've got time. Mm-hmm. Well, what do you think? Looking good. You didn't even look! Mom, you have done, like, a million open houses, and you always look great. Since when do you sweat this stuff? Since you are going off to college in the fall, and I decided I don't want you graduating from veterinary school with a mountain of debt. Well, in that case... you look amazing. Oh, you're so kind. Good luck. What about breakfast? I'll just grab something at the diner. That's not healthy! I'm gonna tell Jackson you said that! Ha. [engine starter failing to turn over] [sighing] I hate this car. I just put in a new battery, too! Well, now I really will be late for work. Well, I have to stop by the diner anyway. -Come on. -Okay. [?] [Betsy]: Mom, it's almost Christmas, and we are the only house without our tree up. [Jane]: I know, I know. We're gonna get to it. Let's fix the car first, then get to decorating. I'll take a look at your car later, see what's going on. [Betsy]: Or we could take it to a mechanic? [Jane]: Do you have any idea how much those people charge? Just to lift the hood! Well, I mean, I've saved my tips, I can pay for it. No, that money's for school. You're gonna need it to buy books and supplies... Believe me, it adds up. No, we've talked about this, honey. It's all about planning ahead, staying focused. Stop worrying! Not everything has to be about me going to college. It's kind of a big deal! True. However, so is having a car that starts when I need it. I'm not sure I'd put those two in the same category. -Mom! -But, point taken. I will take care of it, one way or the other. Okay? Okay. Okay. Oh-ho! Anybody know where I can find a good waitress around here? Sorry, Jackson, I'mma grab my apron. Let me guess. Car wouldn't start again? I should probably push that thing over a cliff. Good idea. You look very nice. It's probably not a good morning to try to work your charms. I guess you're just here for the muffins, then. Mm-hmm. Are they ready? No, I'm a little bit behind, but I can bring them over to you when they're done. Ah, you're busy. No, no. First rule of the Realtor's Handbook-- nothing like that fresh-baked smell to make a house feel like a home. Well... in that case. Here's the address. That was easy. Thank you. Make sure you tell everybody where you got 'em. Thanks. Good luck. [Jane]: What do you think? Looks great. Christmas isn't for a few more weeks. Yeah, but, this way, everyone can get in the holiday spirit early. Though it's still missing something. Yeah, the diner was so busy. Jackson's gonna bring some muffins by later. Ah, and I'm sure it's no bother for him to drop everything and drive halfway across town to your open house. He's doing me a favor. Jackson's a good guy and a good friend. Mm, and not exactly hard on the eyes either. Not to mention he can hold up his end of a conversation. Meg! I have a house to sell. I'm going. I'm going. Just let me remind you, my dear-- the good guys, who are actually good guys, they are few and far between. And let me remind you. I am perfectly fine with my life just the way it is. There's nothing wrong with fine, but it's not the same as happy. [opens door] Bye! Bye. Did I tell you? I finally finished my college applications. And when are you supposed to hear back? Not for a while. A couple of the schools are in-state. I should be fine getting in those. Yeah? And the other ones? Well, they both have these really great veterinary programs. Like... the best in the country. Where are they? California and Montana. Wow. That's a long way from home. Your mom's not gonna be happy about that. I know. Mom wants me to stay in state, but I'm 18 now. She needs to stop worrying about me all the time. This is a big step for her, too. Right? Speaking of your mom... think you could hold down the fort while I go and deliver these delicious muffins to her? Sure thing. All right. You know, I still remember the first time your mom took you down to help Adelaide at the shelter. That look on your face... you were walking on air. I was 12 years old. Yes, I know that, but your eyes still light up the same every time you go down there. Anybody can see how much helping those animals means to you. It's what I want to do. And you will. Because when you find something that you love that much, you don't let anything stand in your way. Not even a protective mother. [both chuckling] Right. Thanks, Jackson. Yeah, don't burn the place down. No promises. The owners put on a new composite roof about eight years ago. It came with a 20-year guarantee. How flexible are they on the price? Well, um... it just came on the market, but, um, I'm sure they'd be willing to talk. Why don't we, uh, go into the kitchen? Seriously, I feel like this town is actually getting smaller, right before my very eyes. You're gonna miss it here and you know it. Gina, please. My best friend is getting all nostalgic, and we haven't even left yet! [?] You can just sit anywhere. [?] Earth to Betsy? Hey, we're going skating tonight. You coming? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Great. Hi. Hi. Hi. Um... would you like something to drink? Water's fine. Thanks. All right. Um... I will give you a minute. Um, these guys on the base were saying that you've got really good burgers here. Oh, yeah. They're great. So... a burger with fries? Please. You got it. I will go put your order up. Um... cheese. I mean, do you want cheese on your burger? Do I? Yeah. Come on! Of course! [laughs] Menu. [Betsy chuckling awkwardly] They're "just looking." [Jackson]: I don't know. You got this whole Christmas vibe going on in here. What? Later on, when he's remembering those warm, holiday feelings, he may want to relive those memories for years to come, by buying this house. Really? Yeah. Well, you know, you run a diner for long enough, you pick up a thing or two. I never knew you were so insightful. Yeah, well, now you do. I'm also pretty handy with cars, if you want me to come by later. Oh, yeah. That's okay. Yeah? One of these days, you're gonna say yes, and I am gonna surprise you. [footsteps receding] Thanks for the muffins. You're welcome. How's that burger? Good! Yeah. Can I get you anything else? Some pie maybe? No, I'm good. Thanks. All right. Are you-- Uh, d-do you live here? In Garland, I mean? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, all my life. It's nice. Kinda small. I like it. It's my first chance to get off the base. Kinda reminds me of home. Talk about small! [laughs] And where's home? Uh, it's a little town in Wyoming. Mm-hmm? You've never heard of it. Worland. Do you get to go back for Christmas? Uh, they got me here doing some special training. There's no time. That's too bad. It's okay. I joined up. It's what I wanted to do, so... My name's Betsy. Tyler. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, Tyler. [chuckles] [door-opening and closing] [footsteps] Come on in! [stammers] Jane? Yes! I thought that was you! It's Ellen Rogers. Well, it was Ellen Smith, back in college, but it's Rogers now. Ellen! Hi! W-- Oh, my gosh! What a nice surprise. How are you? Great! Wow. It is so good to see you. Yeah, you too. You remember Alex? Hi... Jane? Alex! Yes! You know, I always had a feeling you two would end up together. You're the agent for the house? Ask me anything you'd like. Wow. Talk about fate. You know, this is exactly the kind of house we've been looking for. Yeah! But what about you? We all went home for the summer after junior year. We never heard from you again. Yeah... No, it just-- it wasn't in the cards. I started a family instead. We missed you. We always wondered. Long story. But, as you said... here we are. Must be fate. So let me show you the house. Great! Right in here. Jackson! Hey, Mitch. I was just waiting for you. I got another call from the Skyler Brothers this morning. I told you. The diner's not for sale. Just hear me out. I got another call, and they've upped their offer... 10%. Why? What's so special about the place? Well, you know how this area's growing, lots of the people moving in. The Skylers are developers, so this is an investment. Well, still not interested. Thanks, though. Well, let me know if you change your mind. You'll be the first to know. Hey, Betsy. I'm back. Jackson! Hi! Uh, sorry. We-- We were just, uh, you know... Talking. -Mm-hmm. -It's my fault, sir. I was keeping Betsy from her work. I apologize. Oh. That's all right. You are...? Private Tyler Sloane, sir. This is Jackson. I told you about him. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. Very nice to meet you, too. All right. I'm gonna go check on things in the kitchen. Thank you for your service. Thank you, sir. I guess I'd better get back. Yeah. Thanks for talking to me. Yeah. Hey... um... my friends and I are going skating tonight. Would you like to come? We're all meeting at the park. It's on the west side of town. I'll find it. All right. Well, I guess I'll see you tonight then. I'll see you tonight. Bye, now. [sighs] [?] We were good friends in college, and then we lost touch after my junior year. That was the summer I met your dad. I just decided not to go back. I know, you told me. Yeah. Well, it's so strange, you know? I hadn't seen Alex and Ellen since then, and then, here they are, out of the blue, making an offer on this house. Well, I mean, that's great, Mom. You know, it's... it's like Alex said-- it's fate. Like, when the stars line up just right. That doesn't happen very often, does it? The stars lining up just right? No, definitely not. You know, I think that calls for a celebration. What do you say? Let's do something tonight. I kinda promised Gina that I'd go skating with them tonight, so I'll just grab something to eat while I'm out. Oh. Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun. So, uh, who else is going? Just some kids from school. Oh. Have I met them? Mom... What? We're just going skating. I'm just curious, that's all. All right. All right, well, don't come home too late, okay? I won't. Oh! Can I borrow your car? Sure. Thank you! [ice rink music plays in background] Betsy... come on! I'm-- I'm gonna give him another minute. You know, those guys do this all the time. Come into town and check out the local girls. They're just flirting. It doesn't mean anything. I don't know. I... I don't think Tyler's like that. Okay. Just don't wait too long. Okay. [car starter sputtering nearby] [weary sigh] Oh... so help me, I am gonna chop you up and sell you for parts! Wow. Remind me never to get on your bad side. Oh, you're gonna freeze in here. Yeah, that would be absolutely worth it, if I could just get this thing to run! [horn beeps] Yep. That always helps. Did you want something, or are you just here for the show? I heard you got an offer on the house. I wanted to come by and say congratulations. Must've been those muffins. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Are you okay? What? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just this dumb car. So I was talking to Betsy this morning, she was telling me about applying to schools. She's seemed really excited. -Yeah. -Mm. How about you? You wrapped your head around that yet? Sending her off to college? That was always in Betsy's future. But she is leaving. Things are gonna change a lot around here. She's not going to the moon, Jackson. She'll be home for the holidays, and she'll be working in the diner over the summer. Yeah. [sighs] And what are we gonna do in between her visits? Betsy goes off to school, and you're just gonna sweep me off my feet? Yeah, it's worth a shot. Hmm. Well, it hasn't happened yet. What makes you think it's gonna happen now? Sometimes, you just get that feeling, you know? That moment when you know exactly what you should do. And you realize that waiting might be the biggest mistake you've ever made. You know, sooner or later, everything changes. There's no getting around it. [?] [whispers]: Sounds like the solenoid switch. [Jane sighs] Hmm. Betsy! Betsy! [panting]: I'm so sorry. I got assigned duty tonight. I had to get someone to cover for me. I didn't think you were coming. I didn't have your number. I called the diner, but no one picked up. I got here as quick as I could. Would it be all right... maybe we could just talk some more? Okay. [?] I started helping out at the shelter when I was a kid, and I think I knew even then, that that's what I wanted to so. You're gonna be a great veterinarian. [chuckles] You just met me. I can tell. Just by talking to you. The way you listen, like what somebody's saying is important, like it matters. You just... you really care. Did that come out right? Yeah. That came out just fine. [phone line ringing] [Betsy]: Hi! It's Betsy. I can't come to the phone. Leave a message. Hey, honey, just, uh, checking in. It's getting a little late. Give me a call, okay? [Tyler]: I was all set to go to college. And then, one day, I don't know, I went down to the recruiter's office and I signed up. What changed your mind? I'm not sure I changed my mind exactly. It was more like... I couldn't ignore this feeling that I'd had for a long time, that I wanted to do something that mattered. I get that feeling sometimes. -You do? -Yeah. Like... Like you're afraid that you're gonna wake up one day, and it's 20 years later, and... you have no idea what you've done with your life, but whatever it was, it wasn't near enough. Nobody understood before, when I tried to explain that. [chuckles softly] My Dad was in the army. He was? Mm-hmm. That's when my mom met him. Where is he now? He died. He was... killed in action. I was just a baby. I mean, I don't even remember him. I'm sorry. It's okay. And I know that that's why my mom worries about me so much. Because of losing him. And I can tell that, sometimes, when she's looking at me, she's thinking of him. About how much she misses him. I gotta tell you something. I mean, just so you know. I'm only here for two more weeks, and then I ship out. Shipping out? Before Christmas? I'm gonna be gone a while. [rueful chuckle] That's not much time. I was hoping maybe we could... still see each other while I'm here. [?] [kiss] [door opens] Betsy? Do you know what time it is? I have been calling and texting. I turned my phone off and... I forgot to turn it back on. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I promise. Okay. Well, did you have fun? Yeah. Can I tell you about it tomorrow? Goodnight, honey. Okay. Goodnight. [?] [school bell rings] Hey! What happened? You disappeared on me last night. I was texting you. Well, Tyler showed up. -Did he? -Mm-hmm. And Gina... he is so nice! Oh, my gosh. Look at you! All goo-goo-eyed over some cute soldier. Okay, shut up! Just... pace yourself, okay? At least try and get through college before you find the love of your life. Okay, I'm sorry, who said anything about love? I don't know, I just... I really like talking to him. Whatever you say. I'll see you later. All right. Bye. [loudly]: It kinda looks like you're in love! Just sayin'. Okay. Thanks. [exhales heavily] [?] [Betsy]: Hey, Mom. When are we decorating for Christmas? I was thinking that maybe we could go through the Christmas decorations in the garage, maybe get a tree today. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Okay. Say hi to Adelaide. I will! Goodbye. -How are you... -[door thuds] ...Getting there? [?] [?] Good morning, Betsy! Hi, Adelaide. Who's your handsome friend? This is Tyler. Tyler, this is Dr. Roberts. She runs the shelter. Call me Adelaide. Welcome, Tyler. Thank you, ma'am. You're a soldier. Yes, ma'am. Bless your heart. You know anything about animals, Tyler? Well, it sounds like he's pretty congested. He must have been in the cold all night. Well, you get him cleaned up, and I'll get antibiotics for that congestion. All right, sounds good. How's your mom? Good! Good. You know, busy. What does she think about your young man? Well, he's not my "young man". And, I don't know, I just like talking to him. He's a good listener. How long have you guys known each other? Couple of days. Is that why she doesn't know about him? My mom worries about me enough, without knowing that I'm spending time with a soldier. She'll worry a lot more if she finds out some other way. He didn't even come to the door. That's just not like her. She was probably in a hurry. Yeah, and she got home late last night, too. I couldn't get her on the phone, didn't know where she was. Whoever this mystery man is, she may not be ready to talk about it. If she does have a new boyfriend, she might not think it's anybody else's business... not even her protective mother. I'm not "protective". But she is going to college, and that's the point. She needs to stay focused on school, on her-- on her future, so she doesn't ever have to depend on anybody for anything. The last thing she needs right now is to get involved with someone. Betsy's a smart girl. She's gonna be fine! Okay. I'll see you later. -See you. -Bye. [?] [Christmas carols playing] Oh! Hey. Hello. Oh, you look cold. Maybe you need a little something to warm you up? -Thank you. -Sure. Ah, must be nice-- you get to listen to your favorite Christmas music while you work. Don't tell anybody, but, uh, sometimes, when no one is around, I actually sing along. [laughs] Look. I, um... I wanted to thank you for stopping by last night. Sure. And you were right. [sighing] You know... sometimes, it's just hard to wrap my head around the fact that she's actually leaving. I saw, um, Mitch over here. I always thought that if you were in the market for a house, you would come see me. Mm. Yeah. I'm not buying a house. Well, what was Mitch so happy about, then? Well, um... he got an offer from a couple of guys a while back, and they bumped up the price, trying to get my attention. An offer? For the diner? Yeah. Are you really thinking about selling? Well, like I said, they're definitely trying to get my attention. Um, look, I don't really know where I would go if I sold it, so... What do you think about the idea? Well, um... [exhales deeply] Well, the market's pretty strong. It's a good time to sell. Yep. Yep. That's what Mitch said. Yeah. [clears her throat] [sighs] Maybe it's like you said. Sooner or later... everything changes. There's no getting around it. [door opens] All right, girl. Almost done. Trust me. You're in good hands. [chuckling] [phone rings] Ah. Hi, Mom! Yeah, I'm almost through. Uh, no, actually, I've got a ride. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Uh, we should probably go. [?] [keyboard clacking] Hi, Mom! Hey, honey. Oh! Hi. You would not believe how beautiful it was today. And good news! Adelaide found homes for two of the cats! Betsy... whose car is that? I was gonna tell you about that. And? Mom... come on. This... is Tyler. [Tyler]: Hi. Um... [exhales] Tyler. Private Tyler Sloane. It's nice to meet you, Ms. McKendrick. Tyler is a soldier at the base. He came into the diner yesterday, and that's how we met. Yesterday? Wow. I don't know anyone in town. Betsy was real nice, talking to me and all. She told me about the shelter, and said I could drive out with her this morning. He was a big help, too! I'm sure Adelaide appreciated it. I enjoyed it. [tense chuckle] Well, it was great meeting you, Tyler, and thanks for driving Betsy home. Yes, ma'am. Actually, I thought maybe Tyler could stay for dinner. That's all right. He's being polite. I mean, he was stuck on the base for Thanksgiving, can't make it home for Christmas, he ought to have at least one home-cooked meal, right? Um-- I don't want you to go to any trouble. It's no trouble! It's just dinner. Right, Mom? You're welcome to stay, Tyler. Thank you, ma'am. Does your family still in Wyoming? Uh, yes, ma'am. My mom and my little sister, Katie. Mm. Betsy told me about your husband, Mrs. McKendrick. About your loss. I'm very sorry. Thank you. That's him? [Betsy]: Yeah. His name was Danny. He was a Sergeant, right, Mom? Mm-hmm. Was your father in the military? He worked the ranch his whole life. Hmm. And you grew up there, on the ranch? We've been on that land three generations now. Four, if you count me. Wow. So you're going back, after you get out of the army? Mom. Hmm? What's with all the questions? It's okay. I'm just not really sure what I want to do. Mm-hmm. Well, family's important. That's what my mother says. She... wasn't real crazy about me signing up. I felt bad about that. I wasn't doing it to worry her. I was looking for something, and... I couldn't even say what it was, I just knew it was out here somewhere. But she didn't really understand. I wasn't exactly eloquent in making my case. [chuckles softly] Well, I'm sure they miss you very much. I miss them, too. And maybe I will go back. I mean, I do love it there. [Jane]: Mm. Well, it sounds beautiful. I'd like to see it sometime. [?] Ohh... You don't have to do that. Ah, old habit. From home. Your mother raised you right. Thank you. Thank you for dinner. It was really good. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Almost forgot what I was missing. Gonna miss it a whole lot more before too long, I guess. What do you mean? We ship out in a couple of weeks. Oh. You're being deployed? [deep breath, sigh] You know where you're going? Um, I'm not supposed to say. Does Betsy know you're leaving? Yes, ma'am. I told her. [sighs] Sounds like we won't be seeing you for awhile. No, ma'am. [sighing] [?] Betsy? [?] [?] Say hi to Gina for me. It's not Gina. Oh. So? What did you think of Tyler? Well, I think he seems like a nice young man, for someone you've known all of two days. Yeah. [laughs] Yeah, I know, it's crazy, we just met, but... there's something about him, Mom. And I don't know how to explain it. It's like I just... I don't know, I knew. Knew... what? I knew that he wasn't like anyone I'd ever met before. You know, he's sweet. And he's smart... He's just-- He's so amazing. And Jackson liked him, too. Jackson? Mm-hmm. Yeah, they met when I invited Tyler to come skating with everyone. And you know how protective Jackson gets when I go on a date with somebody. And then, when we were skating, Tyler was all worried because he got there late. We really just felt like talking, so him and I went on a walk instead of skating with e-- You said you were with your friends. I... Yeah, no, I just-- I meant... You were gone that whole time. You turned your phone off, I didn't know where you were. We were just talking. Nothing happened. It's not about Tyler. It's about you and me. We have always been honest with each other, no matter what. We don't lie. We... We just don't. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, too. [?] Hey! What're you doing here so early? Why didn't you say something? You knew they were planning on going out. What? You should've told me. She just met that boy. I don't know, I just figured Betsy would tell you. Well, she didn't. I don't see why not. All they did was go skating. No. They didn't go. I don't know where they went. Is she all right? [sighs] That's not the point. I don't know anything about him-- Jane, just take it easy, okay? No! No, don't tell me to take it easy. Betsy's all right. And that Tyler? He's harmless. Yeah, really, you know that just from meeting him once? That there's nothing to worry about? I wasn't gonna-- She's my daughter, Jackson! I have to protect her. [door opens and shuts] [sighs] -Jackson. -Hey! You remember Ray Skyler? Yeah, yeah. How're you doing? Good to see you again, Jackson. Yeah, you too. Ray drove over from Madison this morning. We figured, while you were thinking over their offer, he'd take another look around the diner. [Ray]: If that's all right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No problem. Go ahead. Great. We'll stay out of your way. All right. Cool. I think you'll be very happy in this house. Well, as soon as we get settled in, we'll have to have you and your daughter over for dinner. -Yes. -I can't wait to meet her. Oh, she's a great kid. She goes off to college this fall. Uh-oh, someone's gonna be an empty-nester! So true. How are rehearsals going for the Christmas concert? Good. Yeah. Ms. Lee asked me to do a solo. Nice. What are you gonna sing? We haven't decided yet. Mm. I'm looking forward to seeing that. [sighs] Betsy... I hope you understand why I got so upset. I didn't tell you, because I didn't want you to worry about me. That didn't quite work out, did it? [chuckles dryly] What I mean is... you don't have to be so protective. Not anymore. Well, I'm only protective, honey, because you are such an amazing person, and there are so many things you can do with your life. I don't want to see you make a mistake. Mistake? You have your whole life ahead of you. There's no hurry to get involved with someone. Mom... we're not "involved". I just like spending time with Tyler. Betsy, I know this is hard, but you have to trust me. Okay. But trust works both ways. And I need you to trust that just because I messed up, it doesn't mean that I have forgotten everything you've taught me. Okay. And I understand that. But there are times when we don't see things clearly. When we believe what we want to believe, and then we let our hearts make choices that we hope turn out the way we want. [phone rings] He has to work all night, and this is the only chance he has to talk. Okay. Thanks, Mom. Hi, Tyler. [piano plays] ? And now that winter's here ? Soon it will be Christmas ? I see your face so clear ? Though you're far away ? Your home is in my heart ? It's everywhere I go ? And I'll be waiting here ? Till you're home to stay ? I think of winters past ? We were all together ? The sweetest memories ? All come into play ? Your voice rings in my ear ? Just to let me know ? That you'll be Here with me ? ? Home on Christmas Day [door shuts] Hello? Hey. Wow. It looks nice in here. Thanks. Um... I was gonna call you. Oh, yeah? Yeah, uh... sorry for going off like that. I was worried, and I shouldn't have taken it out on you. That's okay. I get it. Just for the record, Tyler has been by the diner a couple of times. Thanks. Yeah. So Mitch wrote up this offer, dropped it off to me this morning. Oh. How's it look? Oh, I don't know, looks like another language to me. I thought, maybe, if you don't mind, you could... Uh, sure. Cash offer. Waiving inspections. Paying closing costs? Wow. Sounds like they're in a hurry. Yeah. What do you think I should do? Well, I could, um-- I could put out some feelers and see if there's any other interest. Jane, just stop. Okay? Before I sell the diner, I wanna know if there's any other reason that I should stay in Garland. What do you want me to say? You just got to tell me the truth. Well, the truth is that I care about you. And I can't give you what you want. I don't know how anymore. Jane... Okay. [deep breath] I should probably get this back to Mitch. [sighs] [?] [door opens and closes] Gina! Hi, Ms. McKendrick! Hi, honey. Have you seen Betsy? I just wanted to give her a ride home. Oh, she already got a ride with Tyler. Oh. Oh, okay. Thank you. [?] She's gonna be so happy. [Betsy chuckles] Mom! Tyler got it running! Oh! Thank you, Tyler. I used to work on my truck back at home. I had the same problem. If you want, I could show you. I'm sure we'll be fine. He was just trying to help. Yeah, I know. You don't act like it. I'm sorry if I don't sound excited. Uh, how many times have we been down this road? We get it running, we think it's fine... This isn't about the car, is it? It's about Tyler. You don't want him here. Betsy, we're not gonna talk about this right now. I wanna talk about it. It's okay. No... it's not. Mom, Tyler has done nothing wrong. You've got no reason to not like him. That not what this is about. Then why are you so set against him? Because you have more important things to think about right now, and you can't afford to be distracted. I should go. I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I just wanted to help. I'll come with you. No, Betsy. We need to talk. We just did, and I heard everything you said. Betsy. [car doors opening and closing] [car engine starts] [?] [door opens] You didn't have to wait up. I'm not. I had some work to do. I told you... you don't have to worry about me all the time. I'm not gonna do anything dumb. You were out till midnight on a school night. What do you call that? He's leaving in less than a week. I know. You both need to get back into your lives... you in school, Tyler in the army. Who knows when you're gonna see him again... you're gonna see him again. Don't say that. There. Do you even hear yourself? How hard it is already? [sighs heavily] Trust me. It's better to break it off now, before it gets even harder. Before you get hurt. Like the way you were hurt? What? Mom... You never talk about it. About how hard it was for you to lose my dad. To wake up every morning, day after day, and realize that he was never coming home again. -Betsy. -And I know-- ...that I can never begin to understand what that was like for you... And I get it. I mean... maybe the only way you could deal with it was to never risk having feelings for anyone again... Even... someone as caring as Jackson. This isn't about me right now. You're right. It's not. That was your life... and this is mine. And even... if I'm not sure what these feelings are that I have for Tyler, shouldn't I at least get the chance to find out for myself? I mean, shouldn't I get the same chance that you had, to live my life, and to make my own choices? I love you, Mom. [?] [?] Hey! Oh, hey! Look! Betsy's Christmas concert. Ah, yeah, she has a solo this year. That's so exciting. I can't wait to see it. Maybe I'll even get to meet this mystery man of hers. Yeah, he's not a mystery. And he won't be here, he's, uh... being deployed before Christmas. Oh. That's a shame. We should get going. -Okay. -Yeah. All right, ladies. Take care. Say hi to Dave for me, huh? [?] Hey, Tyler. Y'know, I can get you something to eat while you're waiting. Oh, I'm okay. Thanks, though. All right. Let me ask you something. Um, you know Betsy's going away to school. Yes, sir. She wants to be a veterinarian, I mean, that could take, like, six years for her to finish school. I know, she told me. [exhales deeply] Six years... That's a-- That's a long time. You know, a lot of things could change. Not the things that matter. If you really care about somebody, you don't mind waiting. Yeah, but for how long? I guess that depends on how much you care about them. Hey! Hey. [Betsy]: Sorry I'm late! -That's okay. -Hi. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good! So, I'm thinking pie? [?] [Betsy]: I think about it, too, sometimes. I know. But I wouldn't even care... it could be anywhere. All these years, I have never known you to feel the need to check up on your daughter. I'm not checking up on her. I just wanna make sure she's all right. You raised her right, Jane. There's no need to worry. [Jane]: Well, things are changing. Too fast. Tyler's a good boy. He's leaving, Adelaide. What happens then? What if she never sees him again? And what do you think will happen if you keep her from seeing him? I just don't want her to get hurt. Well, getting hurt's part of life, honey, whether you like it or not. It's hard... but people survive. I'd say you understand that as well as anyone. You really like him? Let me tell you something about that young man. When Betsy learned that she was a finalist for that big scholarship? He was more excited about it than she was. Scholarship? For the school in California. She asked me to write a letter of recommendation. She didn't tell you? [sniffles] Thanks, Adelaide. It's okay. Saw Adelaide today. Sounds like you've been pretty busy out there. Kinda. Yeah. She said, uh, Tyler's been a big help, too. Well, I mean, he knows a lot, growing up on a ranch. She also said that, uh, you had some good news. About a scholarship to that school in California? I was gonna tell you about it. I didn't even know you applied. It's no big deal. I mean... All they did was announce the three finalists. Sounds like a pretty big deal to me. Can they do that? I mean, before you've even been accepted by the school? You've already been accepted. It's not official. It's sort of like a pre-acceptance. That's why they told me about the scholarship, to let me know that they're really interested. It would be like a full ride for my first year, and, then, if I keep my grades up, I could qualify for one next year. California's pretty far away. And I know I should have talked to you about it first, but... I really wanted to do this myself. I wanted to decide. And if they say yes, then I wanna decide that, too. I mean... with you, together. But for the right reasons. Not because... you're worried, or... because you're afraid of losing me. I'll be all right, Mom. I know. I'm proud of you, honey. Thanks. [?] [door bell jingles] Sorry, we're closed. Oh, right. I, uh, I didn't realize it was so late. This was a bad idea. No, no, no. If you... have something to say, you should say it. [sighs heavily] These past couple weeks, I, uh... I feel like the whole world is spinning faster and faster, and... I can't keep up. It's like it's out of control, and I don't even recognize it anymore. I keep telling myself that, um... Hmm. I just gotta give it time, I'll get used to it, and then things are gonna make sense again... But... [sighs] That's not it. I have this feeling that, um, a part of me is missing. And it's been missing for so long, that I've forgotten that it's not even there. I've started to pretend that it's-- that it's okay, and that it's normal to be afraid, to really care for anyone. But it's not okay. And I don't want to spend the rest of my life this way. But I don't know what to do. And I just-- I keep thinking, that if I could just talk to you... You would help me make sense of it, 'cause I've always been able talk to you. About anything. Come here. Come here. You still can. You still can. [knocks] Hey, sleepy-head. What time is it? Oh, it's early. It's Saturday. And you have a busy day ahead of you, but I thought maybe we could squeeze in a little time together, just the two of us? How come? Christmas is coming. Mwah! Come on. Let's go. [Betsy]: Well, it's gonna look so beautiful. If only we can get it through the door. Ohh! Your first Christmas. You always wanted to hang this one up yourself. I remember. [?] [background music playing] Should I give her a hand? Oh, not a chance. I happen to know the owner of this place, and I worked out a deal so you could take the day off. Ladies. Thank you. You're welcome. It looks delicious. Yeah. If there's anything else I can do for you, please do not hesitate to ask. What service. I will be sure and tell all my friends about this place. You're far too kind. Mm. What is up with you two? Just eat your food, kid. Okay. So, um, I was thinking that we should drive to Madison this afternoon, and do some Christmas shopping. What do you say? Um, I actually promised Adelaide that I'd help her out at the shelter today. Tyler coming? Yeah, he's gonna meet me there. When does he leave? In two days. You doing all right? Yeah, I'm just-- I'm trying not to think about it. Why don't you invite him over for dinner tonight? I know how you feel about him, Mom. I don't want you to get upset. I won't this time. I promise. Well, I will ask him. Thank you. 'Kay. Well, let's eat and we'll go get your car. Okay. Sounds good. I talked to my mom and my sister last night. Yeah? They said everyone's been asking about me, how I'm doing. Well, that's nice. People have been coming around since I left... Yeah? ...You know, helping out with the ranch. Without me there, it's hard on them. I'm sure they understand. I miss them a lot. And I don't know when I'm gonna see them again. They're proud of you, Tyler. And so am I. I told them about you. You did? They want to meet you. As soon as I get back. Well... I would like that very much. I want to take you somewhere. Right now? Yes. Come on. Okay. Where are you taking me? You'll see. You know, the day we met, my mom said that things happen sometimes because the stars line up just right. And any little thing, any little change at all, and it might not have happened. That's sure true about us. [Betsy chuckles] Don't you ever get worried, though? About what might happen when you go? About if the stars line up a different way and... something changes? Sure I do. I get scared. About going. About what's gonna happen when I get there. About not knowing. You have to promise me that you're gonna be careful, Tyler. I will. I promise. I wish we could stay here forever. [?] [phone buzzes] Oh! Thank you. So I'll see you at 6:00? I just need to report in to the base, and I'll be over for dinner. Okay. Bye! [starts engine] [?] [tires squealing] [crashing] Betsy! Betsy! Betsy! Hey! Hey! [?] [cell phone ringing] Hi, Adelaide. Where is she? Hey. Hey. She's all right. She's in with the doctor right now. He's making sure nothing's broken. Broken? She's good. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. You're sorry? You put my daughter in the hospital, and you're sorry? I... no-- Who even asked you to touch her car? Who asked you for anything? I-I was helping! We don't need your help, Tyler. Not with her car. Not with her life! And I don't need you filling her head with dreams of what the world is gonna be like. Okay? Because just when you think everything's gonna be fine, and just when you let your guard down, this right here, this is what happens. [?] I need to see Betsy. It's okay. It's gonna be fine. She's just upset. You didn't do anything wrong. Mom? Hey, sweetie. How're you feeling? I'm okay. Well, the doctor says nothing's broken, so we can go home in a little bit. [weak chuckle] I didn't mean to scare you. No, it wasn't you. It was me. I never should have let you drive that broken-down car out there. But Tyler fixed it. [sighs wearily] I know he tried. Obviously, he didn't. I hit ice. Mom, I hit a patch of ice. This had nothing to do with what Tyler did to the car. I didn't realize... Tyler got me out of the car. [tearing up]: I was really scared, Mom... Oh... But he held my hand and he talked to me the whole way. [sighing deeply] There she is. How're you doing, kiddo? Okay, I guess. Yeah? Good. I'm glad you're all right. Where's Tyler? Uh... Hey, why don't we get you home, so you can rest, okay? -Yeah. -Yeah. Can I help you, ma'am? Yes, I need to see someone on the base. Private Tyler Sloane. Did you arrange for a pass? No, but it's important that I talk to him today. He ships out tomorrow. Sorry, ma'am. I can't let anyone on base without authorization. I understand, I just... [sighs] Can you call him for me? Ma'am... Please. Just tell him that Jane McKendrick needs to talk to him. Will Private Sloane know what this is regarding? He's in love with my daughter. Ma'am, please pull over there. [?] [knocks on window] Is Betsy all right? Yeah, she's resting at home. She's gonna be fine. Good. That's good. I came to thank you, for being there, for helping her. What else did you think I was gonna do? I didn't mean... I know how much you care about Betsy. No, ma'am. I don't think you do. No, maybe not. I'm sorry, Tyler, for what I said at the hospital. I was afraid, and I shouldn't have taken it out on you. You said how you really felt. Hey, it's cold. Why don't you get in the car? I still got a lot to do. We're shipping out tomorrow, so... Please? [?] I didn't plan on this happening. I know. Those dreams you were talking about? They weren't just Betsy's. They're mine, too. Being with her is like nothing I've ever felt before. And I just want to do everything I can to make her happy. Didn't you ever feel that way about somebody? Like there's nothing you wouldn't do for them? Once. A long time ago. [rueful chuckle] I was about your age when I met Danny. I was home from college, and, uh, I was sure I had met the only person I would ever love. All I wanted was to spend the rest of our lives together. So I dropped out of school, and... we, uh, settled in for a "happily ever after". Except it didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. By the time I was pregnant with Betsy, he was deployed overseas. A little place I'd never heard of. A place I wish I had never heard of. [sniffles] It was just like you see in the movies. Two men in uniform came to the door... [deep, shaky breath] And my world stopped. I'm sorry. I decided to stay in Garland to raise Betsy. It wasn't easy, but we managed. And I promised myself that I would never let anything cause her that kind of pain. Including me. Being a veterinarian is the most important thing to Betsy. And please forgive me, but, when you're gone, I don't want her to forget that. She has to finish school. And when she does... I'll be the one cheering the loudest. And if she still wants me, I'll thank God for making me the luckiest man on earth. I think Betsy'd be pretty lucky, too. [quiet chuckle] [?] [exhales deeply] Ah. All right. You leave tomorrow. And I still owe you dinner. Yes, ma'am. I've got an idea. [?] [?] -Hey. -Hey. [sighs] I'd say dinner was a success. [Jane]: Yeah. They're so happy. Tonight was gonna be really hard for those two. What you did was a good thing, to make everything just a little bit easier. It's not tonight I'm worried about. It's what happens next. Mm. Well, what happens next is... I'm gonna take you, and we're gonna go for a walk in the snow, and look at all the Christmas lights. Mm. And after that? After that... uh, well, we'll see. [?] [?] ? Jingle bells Jingle bells ? ? Jingle all the way ? Oh, what fun It is to ride ? ? In a one-horse open sleigh How's the concert coming? Good. Yeah. Yeah? You ready for your solo? I think I'm ready. Aw, I'm sure you're gonna do great. [text alert] I am supposed to Facetime with Tyler. Ah. Sure. How's he doing? He's good, I guess. I mean, he's still settling in, and he doesn't really like to talk about it much. He mostly just wants to hear about what's going on here. [sighs] I can't believe it's only been a week since he shipped out. Go ahead, honey. Don't be late for your call. Okay. Thanks, Mom. [?] [Tyler]: Betsy? Hey! Hi! -[bell jingling] -Ho, ho, ho! [laughs] Tyler, hi! What are you doing? Gotta do something to make it feel like Christmas over here. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I miss you. I miss you, too. [static crackling] Tyler? Yeah! No, I'm good. This connection gets a little tricky sometimes. Oh! Okay, well, there you are. Listen... I can only stay on for a minute anyway. I just wanted to tell you how much I wish I could be there for your concert. It's just this is the last chance I'll have to talk for a while. What do you mean? My unit's going out today. I don't know for how long. I can't really talk about it. I just know that we'll be off the grid until we get back. Oh. Well... Just be careful, okay? Don't worry, I'll be fine. Enjoy your concert, all right? If I don't talk to you, have a great Christmas. Okay. [static crackling] Tyler? [static crackling and screeching] Tyler? [Betsy sniffling] I just miss him. I know. This is really hard. Yeah. Come here. [?] I guess I thought things might cool down a little bit after Tyler left, make it easier for her. Yeah, why would Betsy let a little thing like 7,000 miles come between them? I just-- I don't how to help her. The thing she says makes her happy is the same thing that makes her cry at night. Sometimes, the hardest part of being a parent is knowing when you have to take a step back. I've always been there for her, Meg. Yes, you have, and you always will. But you've also shown her how to overcome all the troubles that life throws at you. You've taught her how to make her own choices, and how to live by them. She's a lot stronger than you think. [sighs] You made sure of that. [background chatter and music] You look beautiful, honey. Thanks, Mom. -[chuckles] -There you are! Oh! Hi, Ms. McKendrick. Hi! Come on, Betsy, we gotta get ready! Okay. I'll-- I'll see you after, Mom! You got this, kiddo! -Bye! -Bye! Ahem. [laughs] Oh... A tie? I'm impressed. Oh, good. That's exactly what I was going for. You look good. Thank you. You... wow, you look amazing. I'm glad you're here. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. [show bell chiming] Um... I think they're trying to tell us something. I think you're right. [?] Good evening, and Merry Christmas, everyone. Thank you all for coming to the annual Garland High School Christmas concert. [applause continues] As we do each year at our Christmas Concert, we'd like to pay tribute to the men and women of the armed forces, especially those who have been stationed at Ft. Tooley. We have come to know many of them well, taking them into our community and into our hearts. In serving our country, some have made the ultimate sacrifice. Please join us for a moment of silence to honor the heroes who have given their lives for our freedom. Darryl Rogers. Stephanie Johnson. Tyler Sloane. [?] [distantly, fading]: Richard Robles. Rebecca Smith. And Dwayne Jones. Thank you. [?] [sobbing] Excuse me. [door bangs] [sobbing] [?] [weeping] Betsy. Mom. Baby. Baby... Oh, I'm so sorry. [?] [?] Betsy? Dinner! Honey? Dinner's ready. I'm not really hungry right now. Are you sure? Thanks. You were right, Mom. [sniffles] It hurts too much. It's like... [shaky breath] Like everything inside of me is broken, and it's never gonna get better. Honey. No, Mom... you were right. It's not worth it. [?] No open house today, huh? No. Ah. It's cold out here. Thought you could use one of those. -Thank you. -Cheers. How's she doing? She's, uh, hurting. So much. Is there anything I can do? She said I was right. That it's not worth it. What? Being in love, that it hurts too much, it's not worth the pain. What have I done, Jackson? She has her whole life ahead of her, and this is how I've taught her to deal with this pain? To be afraid of her feelings? Jane, I mean-- I didn't mean to do this to her. Or to you. I'm so sorry. I don't know how to change it. You gotta start by taking a chance. I mean, that's what love is, right? Taking a chance that what you're feeling is real, and that other person feels the same about you. And it doesn't matter how you get there, but you've got to overcome the hurt and the pain and the fear. Because sharing those feelings with somebody, that is worth taking the chance. So what do you say? You want to take a chance with me, Jane? You know, you said that, one day, I'd say yes, and you'd surprise me. Um... Okay. Is that a yes? [?] That's definitely a yes. Please don't leave me. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna have to tell Mitch I got a better offer. [?] He's beautiful. Yeah. He's feeling better now. Goes home tomorrow. Home for Christmas... Yeah. You know... we invited some friends over for Christmas dinner. Yeah, I know. What do you want to do? They're all... [chokes up] They're all just gonna feel sorry for me, so... They care about you. That doesn't change anything. [sniffles] I mean... all caring about somebody means is that you can get hurt. No, honey. I was wrong. What? [sighs] It is worth it. Love is worth all the hurt. When you find someone that you can love with all your heart, someone who loves you, it's like nothing else in the world. Okay. Well, he's gone, so... Yeah, but that love you shared with Tyler is still inside you, and it'll be a part of you forever. You can't ever forget that. You can't ever stop loving, no matter how much it hurts right now. [sobs] That's something I forgot, something I learned from you... From seeing you and Tyler together. To treasure that love, to hold on to it with everything you've got. Why does it hurt so much? Because it was real. [weeps] Mom... I miss him. [?] [?] Here you guys go. Once a waitress, always a waitress. [chuckling] Excuse me, everyone. If I could have your attention, please, I have an announcement to make. First of all, I can't tell you how much it means to us to have you all here for Christmas. And... as all of you know, I never miss a chance to brag about my daughter, and tonight will be no exception. Mom. So, I am proud to tell you that Betsy is a finalist for the Margaret Devane Memorial Scholarship, a very generous award from a very prestigious university in California. [all murmuring] And... although she hasn't been officially accepted yet... [sighs] I feel confident that she'll be starting school there in the fall. [Jackson]: Cheers! Cheers. Thanks, guys. And... dinner will be ready in 10 minutes. Ooh! [quiet chatter resumes] [?] That's amazing. That's big news. I know. [?] [car approaching] Mom? Betsy? Are you all right, honey? [?] Tyler! Tyler-- They told us you were... Tyler? I hope I'm not interrupting. [?] I got banged up pretty bad... by the time I could think straight, found out my name got mixed up with another soldier. I had to let my mom and sister know first. I thought about calling, but I figured... I should just come in person, so you'd know it was really me. [sobbing]: Tyler! [Betsy sobbing] [?] [quiet chatter] [?] They're gonna be okay. Yeah, they are. Yeah. What about us? [sighs] Thank you. For what? For talking me into taking another chance. [?]
