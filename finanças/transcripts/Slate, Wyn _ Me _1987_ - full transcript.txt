[lion roaring] [rock music] -It's fucked! -A little pump would't cut it. -I told you, it's fucked! -It's gotta be something else. -Well, come have a look yourself if you don't believe me. Hey look, some bastard shot a hole in the pipe. It wasn't me, I'm not that bloody stupid. -Wouldn't put money on it. -Morgan probably shot it. He was down there the other night. -Morgan's not that bloody stupid. -Hey, what's that supposed to mean? -Got a guilty conscience or something, huh? -Everytime something fucks up, you blame me. -It gives me something to do! -Bastard! -Come on, come on, come on! [laughter] Things are really fuck up lately, like that Del Downer of yours. -She's okay. -Every guy from here to Sydney's been through. -So? I like her. -So if you don't look out, you and Del and somebody else's kid will be up the church getting married with old man Downer right behind you with his shotgun. -I'm not that bloody stupid. -One day we're going to have to get out of here, right? We're not going to do it with Del and a kid around your neck. -What are you talking about? -You like living here? -It's all right. -Fucking doubt. -Mate, we're set. At least give it a go. -No, wasting our time. -Trouble with you is you're a bloody pessimist! -Is that how we're going to pump the water up? -Well that won't do it. We'll buy another one, Jesus! -With what? Bottle tops? [glass shattering] [country music on radio] -Oh, what the hell is he up to? [howling] -Yeehaw! [howling] -Look out where you're going, you fucking ape! Christ! Jesus! -Christ! [car horns honking] [chuckling] [country music] -What are you two guys doing here? You'll alarm the town of the whole place. -The boss in? -Yeah. -What are you saying there, prick? -Oi. It's the prick behind the door you should worry about. I told you it was a bad idea. -You're supposed to wave the Vietnam veteran bullshit on them. -Like I told you, when you're dealing with pricks, they expect you to crawl. Fucking... -Where do we get the money now? -Who gives a shit, huh? [chatter] They'll shoot you for even thinking about it, come on. I'll buy you a beer. [chatter] [pop music] -You should be ashamed of yourself! Shut up! Oh, don't just stay there, you warts, help me pick him up. -You were born ready to pick him up! [laughter] -Oh, typical! -DO you want a drink? -I'll drink mine, put him in the car. And if you barf in my car again, I'm going to dump you and you can walk! -Lousy personality! -You coming in? -I could be. What is she doing with Wilkinson? -She's staying with his family. I reckon she's real rich. -Yeah? -Without getting mixed up with boys like he. [pop music] -Where's that smart ass brother of yours? -Oh, I don't know. (Wilkinson) You can tell him from me he's in trouble. I want to see him tomorrow down at the station. -Prick. -What's all that about? -Oh, bugger's all I know. -Haircut! -Well, are you coming in? Not the best time, eh? -Well, I don't know, your old man's got a screw loose. -But he's sleeping! -I wanna promise with her, mate! -Night out on the town? -At Wilkinson's on the youth of this afternoon. It's no bullshit, he just walked in! -Better drive Mark's car. -Oh, pissed mates now, are we? All right, what's going on, Slate? -Nothing. -Hey, you guys. There's a can going on at Tommy Morelli's place tonight. -I gotta go. -What's the matter with him? -Christ knows. Figure that's what the army does to you. Bugger doesn't know how to have a good time anymore. [imitating barking] [pop music] -Hi, Del! Girl, help, help! -What do you think you're doing? -Don't back around, give us a hand! -Voice down, my old man might be awake! [screaming] [metal clanging] Ah, shit! [groaning] -You peeping bastard. I'll give you something to perv on! -Get going, he means it! -Jesus Christ! -Bloody sex maniac! I'll teach you bastards to hang around here! [gunshot] [laughter] -You're lucky you're not picking pellets out your ass. -I'm going to the dance, you coming? Ah, jeez, mate, the army's knocked all the bloody fun out of you. -Shooting faces is my idea of fun. I'm getting out. -Eh? -This is enough. You coming? -Where? -There's no coming back. -What are you talking about? -Once you're in, that's it. -In what? Hey! If the marshall doesn't get us, we're set for life! -Don't celebrate and fill the bloody bag! -Jackson? You're in trouble. -Yeah, I was gonna leave a note on the door in case I need to get out. Bloody car broke down. -I'm not surprised. You know you're a lucky man? Well, I should run you in for that stunt you pulled this afternoon. But seeing as I'm such a nice guy, I'll just fine you $20 instead. Because you try anything like that again, and I'll have you in the slammer quicker than you can blink. And another thing. I want that heap of shit brought in for roadworthy certificate. What's the matter with it, anyhow? -Nothing much, it's just... -What the hell are you doing there? -Drop the rifle, Wyn. -You got a licence for that thing? Come on. Don't be a stupid little bastard. Give it to me. -Get to the car, Slate. -Drop the fucking rifle, Wyn. -Get the car, Slate. -Don't be a bloody fool. [gunshot] -Come on! [grunting] Open the back! -Where are we going? What about the girl? -We're going somewhere to think. -I didn't mean to do it. -You had a fucking rifle, Wyn, what, were you gonna hit him with it? -It was a fucking accident! -You shot a fucking cop, mate! Which means we're fucked! So start thinking. -She looks pretty crazy. You better have a look at her. Hey, maybe he isn't dead. -It doesn't change a thing. Now, I know how badly you want to be your own man. But just this once, I'll carry it, all right? Maybe I can get out of it pleading Vietnam and shit. But you won't. -I'll cover my own ass. -Sure? Okay. We should probably get rid of her. -Dump her? No mate, no way! -I don't mean to fucking kill her! I didn't want anyone killed in the first place. Look, if I need to I'll do it. -You can't just kill someone like that! -I have before. -Yeah, that was different, that was the army! -What's so different, mate? Should be okay until morning. [car engine whirring] [country music] -Hi, how are you? Look, I want you to know you'll be okay, all right? We won't hurt you, as long as you just do what we say. Do you understand me? Yeah, I know, I'd be a bit scared too. Um... I'll get you some food and something to drink later. -The fuck are you up to? (Wyn) She could've died for all we know. -It's the least of our bloody problems. We should get her some food and water. -Don't be bloody crazy, we might have to get rid of her. It's like a stray animal, once it's fed it's twice as hard. -We're not getting rid of her, all right? Take her up north and let her go and we find some way out of the country. -We're at Tommy Morelli's, right? [car engine roaring] -You did it, didn't you? -What are you raving about? -You made Martin help you, you bastard! That's why you've been so charming with him, isn't it! -You were with him, silly bitch. -No I'm not, the police have arrested him. -Why'd they do that? -I just saw them take him from the bank and put him in a police car. [crying] -We better get the car. You get the car. -Where's the girl? I know you did her! -He did nothing, all right? I did it! -For Christ's sake, not now, get moving! -It's like we'll never make it through town, let alone across the river. -There aren't no roadblocks up yet. -Shit, Morgan knows already. -Tell him nothing. -They found WIlkinson outside the bank this morning with a bullet in his gut. -Are the bridges blocked? (Morgan) Don't know, but they're bringing cops from the city. They're looking for the girl, too! -It's like we're bagged if we can't get across the river. -What about Hobson's bridge? -You're kidding? -Hey, wait! -We'll kill ourselves! (Slate) Maybe. -Shouldn't we take them across first? -No point. -What if the bridge gives way? -Then we'll drown with the drums. Will you stop yapping and give us a hand? -We might get across and not be able to go back for the drums. -Yeah, and we could get stuck on this side with the drums over there. Right, we'll toss to see who drives the car across. You call. -Tails. Tails it is. -Right, get her out. -Come on. [muffled groaning] -What's your name? Come on up. I said get up, you silly bitch! -Don't speak to me like that. And I'm not crossing that bridge. He's right, we'll kill ourselves. -Well, you've got no choice. So move. Go on, move! -Here you go. Just don't look down. Come on, come on, we're halfway there. Hey, wait! Bastard. [dramatic music] You bastard! -Well, don't stand there gawking, mate, let's get the gear! -I won the toss, Slate. -Come on, you would have parked it in the river. -Oh, very funny. Listen, we've got to agree on a few things, otherwise we're going to end up in deep shit! [car engine roaring] [car engine coughing] Out! Listen. Nobody touches my fucking car, all right? You don't want to go back in there, do you? -You get your hands off me! You don't want me touching your car? I don't want you touching me. [rock music] -Still don't see why we didn't bring it with us. -Won't be any use where we're going. -But we couldn't get... Oh, come on, Slate, she knows. -If she didn't, she fucking does now. -She saw us bearing it, what does it matter? -It matters, because it means we can't let her go. -We'll have to stop in a minute. -Why? -I need to relieve myself. -You what? -I want to go to the toilet. -Okay. Better make it snappy. -Here? -Well, where else? -I can wait until we reach some trees. -Okay. We got a long way. -How long? -Oh, I don't know, Slate, how do you reckon? Could be up to 200 miles. -Oh yeah, easily, could be more. -I'll go behind the car. -Let her go, that's enough. Right-o, hurry up! Game's over! -I wonder what she's like underneath that dress. -The last thing we need right now is any of that shit. [screaming] -Enjoy your trip? You all right? Hey, Slate! She slit herself! Where were you going to go, anyway? You'd just die out here. -Have a swig of this, a long one. -You pushed me. -Don't be bloody silly, come on. [screaming] You want one now? [coughing] Have another, won't hurt so much. [coughing] Get the vasoline and the cotton wipes down in the glove box. We'll get a dressing on it. -If they've got the dogs after us, they'll have no trouble finding you. -Will you plug it? -She's pretty pissed. -Good, I like her that way. Makes her easier to handle. Why don't you take her down to the river and clean her up, eh? -Why don't you? Come on, up. Gotta get you cleaned up. Okay mate, time to get your clothes off. -I beg your pardon? -Get your clothes off. -I am not. -Listen, you silly bitch, you need to wash, you stink! -Hey! -You're not getting my clothes off! Leave me alone! Pig! -Damn bitch, I wouldn't scew you if you paid me! (Blanche) You're a puny little creep aren't you? -How'd you like a smack in the mouth? -Is that all you're capable of? (Slate) Wash yourself and put these on. -All right. If you don't watch. -As if I wanted. Shit! What did you give her my shirt for, eh? That's my favorite shirt! -Take it easy. Use one of mine. -Take it easy, Jesus Christ, you smashed up my car and the girl is now wearing my clothes as well! -Look, half the time she'S shit scared. Give her a chance. -Give me a chance, more like it. You're siding with her. -I didn't side with anyone. -Maybe that's the fucking trouble. Feeding the stray animal, eh? [country music] -I'm not hungry, thank you. (Slate) Where are you from? (Blanche) Mariston. (Slate) Mariston? You don't sound like a country girl to me. (Blanche) My parents have a property there. (Slate) So what were you doing in Mowbray? (Blanche) I'm a teacher. (Slate) What were you doing with Wilkinson? -He was giving me a lift home from the dance -Hey! -He your boyfriend, huh? -Glad to see you got some taste. -I don't think that's at all funny. The poor man could be dead. -Who says he's dead? -What if he is, Slate? -If he's dead, he's dead. There's nothing we can do about it. -Maybe we should try and find out. -Forget it. Doesn't matter. We're about as far up shit creek as we can get. -How do you think his family feel? -Fuck his family. -Charming attitude. [truck horn honking] -Shit! Bastard! [car horn honking] -Shit, what the hell are you trying to prove? -It's her fault! Fucking bitch. -My fault? You drive like a madman. I'm more surprised you haven't done more damage. -Listen here, you. You aren't a teacher anymore, you're a fucking hostage. So if I say it's your fault, it's your fucking fault, all right? -And if you learned how to control your temper a little bit, you wouldn't find yourself in such stupid situations. [instrumental music] -You sure you know how to put all this back together again? -Lay her off, or I'll get Wyn to tie you up. -What would you do if it didn't start? -It would be a pain in the ass. Grab her, she's got the wrench! -Hey! -There's fuck all chance of finding it. You don't give up, do you? -Get out of my way. [screaming] -You wanna fuck with me? Fuck with me? You wanna fuck with me? I'll fuck you! [screaming] That's what you get when you fuck with me, bitch! -You bastard! -From now on, you behave yourself! -You're a god damned bastard! -Keep your mouth shut. Or by Christ I'll make you wish you had. -I'd rather be dead! -Yeah, well fucking drop dead then. [instrumental music] -Here. Slate never holds a grudge. He'll be over it by the time he gets back. Christ, he really put the shits on me there. -It was worth it. You won't find the wrench in there. -Listen, um... I wouldn't push your luck, otherwise you might find yourself dumped here. -She'll hobble back to the road and stop the first car she sees... Or knock it off another car. Tartan's not far from here. -We haven't dived yet. -Not worth it. -Okay. I'll go. Slate, I'll go! -I fucked up, all right? I'll go. -Why don't you both go? -Listen, if she tries anything again, shoot her. I'll be back early morning. -I thought you said he didn't hold grudges. (Wyn) Don't be stupid. I'm not one of your dumb school kids. -Listen, the police know everything by now, anyway, they must. It's not gonna hurt to let me go. -Oh yeah? -I won't tell them anything. Promise. -We might need you to bargain with later. -Then tell me where you're going. -You'll find out soon enough. -You don't know where you're going, do you? You're not going to get away. People who shoot policemen don't get away. -Shut up. That was an accident. -Then you should give yourself up. -Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? -That has nothing to do with it, you know it's the right thing to do. -Blanche. Blanche. What sort of a name is Blanche anyway? -Can't stand it, reminds me of blancmange. It's a pudding. -Then change it! -Everyone knows me as Blanche. -We don't. -I always liked Maxine. -Maxine? That's worse! -No, Max. -Max? Well Max, I reckon that's a pretty good job. Cops catch us, they'll reckon you're one of the notorious Jackson brothers. We better get back. -Why? -Because I said so. Come on. -You're much nicer than Slate. -Cut the crap, move. Move. Where's the rest of it? You're a bloody alcoholic. -Hey, don't waste it! It's mine, remember? -Come on, you had enough already. [country music] Cut it out, you're being stupid. -Just give it to me. -Take it easy, okay? Or I'll shoot you like Slate said. -I don't think you would. -How do you know? -Because you like me. [country music] -Down! Whatever happens, don't move. -I'm scared. -So am I. (Slate) Wyn? -G'day. (Slate) What's going on? -We thought... I thought it was the cops. I was just trying to keep her quiet. -Yeah. (Wyn) Yeah, I was! -Like fuck you were. Pack up, we're leaving. -Slate, you've got it wrong! (Slate) Forget it. -He's right, there was nothing going on. -Just shut up and get in the car, all right? -What the fuck is that? [country music] Woo hoo! Woo hoo! [gunshot] -What about that dump up in Gosley? -No, we'd have to cross the river again. -There's a bridge. -Too risky. They'll have it blocked. -Maybe they don't think we're this far north, eh? [gunshot] -So what do we do about Blanche? (Wyn) You mean Max. [gunshot] (Slate) Max? Your name is Blanche, isn't it? -Not anymore. What if I drive? -Give us a break. -Just think about it. They'll be looking for the other car. -Give it a go, Slate. -Come on, she'd give the game away the moment we hit a roadblock. -Well I wouldn't, you see, because you would let me go as soon as you get away. That's the big plan, isn't it? -I never told her that. -Well? -I don't trust Max here. -Well, I could get in there with her. With the rifle, I mean. -Maybe we'll head up north as planned, eh? (Wyn) I got a better idea. Shift. [engine roaring] [instrumental music] [grunting] -Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, you're dragging a bit, there, mate. (Wyn) Shut up! I'm doing all the work. -We there yet? (Wyn) Shut up. Hey! Aren't we going to get her? -No, let her go. See how far she gets. [screaming] [grunting] You all right? [gagging] Lift your legs up. [panting] Grab a blanket. Turn the car off. Don't argue, just do it! All right, take it easy. You'll be all right, okay? [rock music] You're a bloody idiot. -Got a better idea, have you? -Wyn's right. We have to eat. [rock music] -Baked beans. If only they'd put labels on the bloody things. -The cops have got nothing to worry about, we'll fart ourselves to death. [laughter] -It won't be so funny when we run out of fucking food! -So what's worrying you? (Wyn) Nothing. -Come on, mate, out with it. (Wyn) I told you, nothing's worrying me. -Nothing ever does, as far as I can see. -What'd you say? -I said, "nothing ever does, as far as I can see." -Listen. If I want your opinion, from now on, I'll ask for it. Otherwise, keep your smart ass mouth shut. [rock music] Reckon anyone comes around here? -Nah. Maybe we should hang for a while, eh? Let the heat die down. -Looks like it's just heating up. -What? -Nothing. Listen, let's dump her and head north, like we agreed. -It's not so bad here. -It's not so good here. -Let's stay for a few days and think about it, eh? -I wouldn't mind staying here for a while I think. -Is she for real? Is she? -Search me. -I suppose my opinion doesn't count. -Yeah. Your opinion doesn't count. -What'd you do, Max, if we... let you go now? [sigh] -I'd stay here. -Don't you want to go home? -No, not particularly. -I don't believe this. -I didn't shoot anyone. -There it is, then. Looks like we're staying. -Yeah, there it fucking is! (Blanche) Do those still work? (Slate) Might. (Blanche) Will you stop Wyn if he decides to leave? -Why, do you... do you want him to leave? -Why is that you feel you have to share the blame with him? -Blame's got nothing to do with it. -Would you have killed me? -That was a long time ago. -Would you? (Slate) Maybe, maybe not. -Wyn! -Yeah? -Why don't you clean up the cans? -What? -Well, it'S nicer if there's no mess, don't you agree? -If I wanna make a mess, nobody, especially you, is going to stop me. -Come on, Wyn, it'll only take a second. (Wyn) What the fuck are you doing? You two are both fucking nuts! You hear me? -Give us a break, Wyn. -Give you a break, for Christ's sake, look at yourself! -You're blowing things out of proportion, mate. -You're stoned all the time and she's got you playing house! Can't you see what's happening? -Like I said... You're getting things out of proportion. [rock music on radio] [music stops] [laughter] -I'm going for news. -Is that a good idea? -It's a long walk. (Wyn) Yeah. See you tomorrow. -Yeah. [plane engine whirring] [car horn honking] You sold me out, you bastard! -Max, go inside. -No, we're leaving! You, start running. -Drop the rifle, Wyn. -Shut up! Start running, you fucking bitch! -Why don't you shoot her, eh, Wyn? [gunshot] -Are you totally crazy? They're onto us, fucker! (Slate) I'm not leaving without her! -Didn't you hear the plane, or were you too busy fucking? -You wanna shoot her for that, eh? Eh? Look, I didn't want to bring her, you did. -Yeah, she's pissed off now, let's go, come on. -It's too late! Christ's sake. She's one of us! Listen. I'm your fucking brother. Nothing's going to change that, all right? -Shit! [sheep bleating] Hey, Max? It's late! Max! Hey Max, it's late! -Thought this was sorted out. Listen, we're not going anywhere without Max. -Time's up. It's my ass on the line. -Mine too. -I shot the cop, remember? You make me stay here, I'm finished. You want to stop me? Go right ahead. [gunshot] [dramatic music] [train whistle] [country music] -If you're going, go, we're getting close to Melbourne. [grunting] [gunshots] [dramatic music] [panting] [radio chatter] -Wyn! Mate! -I need food. (Morgan) I've been following the whole thing from the day it started! -I need a rifle. -They reckon you're heading north. They're bringing dogs from Melbourne. They'll be here tomorrow. -Take it. Come on, take it, you need it. -We need it, all right. Not the bad luck that's riding with it. They'll reckon you'll get your payback on the girl. Don't do it, Wyn. Put it behind you, Mate. Here's your money, and go north. -G'day. Who's chasing you? [chuckling] The law, or a skirt? -Both. -Easy there, mate. Sit down. You look as though you could do with a drink. Most people call me Sammy. So where are you from? -Around. -It's my own rye. [coughing] -You think I ate anybody? -Eh? -Like that fellow down in Mowbray. -What fellow? -You know. The fellow whose clothes they found on the riverbank. He was all ate up. Hands and face all gone. -Didn't hear about it. -They reckon it was this Jackson fellow. The cop killer, got away a few weeks back. -How'd they know it was him? -Oh, his sister. Someone recognized him by his watch, or his shirt like. Still. I reckon this lot's all right. I'll get cooking. [children laughing] [car horn honking] [dogs barking] That's Stephanie. She was living there in the city. Couldn't get a job, because she's black. She came up here to live. And every time a fellow has a go, she acts like the worst night in the brothel. How you going, Tommy? (Tommy) Good, Sammy. Who's your mate? -This is Max. He's staying with me for a few. -Heya, Max. -Ah! I brought some muscat down. (Tommy) You can stuff that muscat. (Sammy) How's that old girl of yours? (Tommy) She's good, mate. I better drink that. (Sammy) Where is she, eh? [instrumental music] -Coming for a swim? What was she like? (Wyn) What are you talking about? -The girl that you're thinking about. -Don't know what you're talking about. -Yes you do, Wyn Jackson. I don't know you or what happened between you, the girl and your brother. But I know one thing. It's eating you out, and that'll get you killed. [suspenseful music] [clicking] -There's a ten grand reward out for you. And I hear they're not fussy whether you're breathing or dead meat. Where were you headed? Back to get the girl? The word is you got away with 50 000. I'm not greedy. So I'll only take half. But then you can piss off. -You're wasting your time, mate. -Don't you bugger me up. Don't try it! [clicking] [screaming] [dramatic music] -That's a good boy. -Hello, Max. You thought I was dead, didn't you? -No. I knew you'd turn up. What are you going to do? Are you going to kill me? Are you? -You fucking deserve it. You killed Slate. -You believe that? I didn't kill anybody. I didn't ask to come with you. I had no choice. Slate understood that. -Don't you talk about my brother. Don't you fucking dare mention his name! -I have just as much right to mention his name... -You've got no right! You made us stay in that stinking dump. My brother died because of you. Why shouldn't I pay you back? Because I'm part of you now. And you're part of me. It won't just be me you'll be killing. I'm having a baby. It's Slate's. I'm sorry. Listen, I want to come with you. -You can't come with me. I'm going away for a long time. And besides... You've got a kid to take care of. -We'll be waiting, then. -See you, Max.
