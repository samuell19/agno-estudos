The giant is here... I'm coming to get you. Where are you? Where are you? No, no, I hear the... horrible little elves! Don't come near me. Where are you? I'm gonna get you. You're horrible. Aw! Oh, you got me. You got me. You beat me. Again, Grandfather. Again. William Carr. Sir, we've just received analysis of new satellite data. Go on. Images from the search area in Iceland revealed some resurfaced materials. We assess an 80 percent probability it's the object we're looking for. Initiate phase one. Okay. Hi. Hi, how you all doing over there? Oh! Nice day for it. Doctor Sally Speight. - Hi. - Hi. University of Anchorage. Climatological Survey Team. Oh, yeah, I read about it. You're here to measure the melting glaciers, right? That is correct. We are here to survey the effects of global warming. One of our weather satellites picked up the wreck, but looks like you beat us to it. Sometimes the melting glaciers throw up a surprise. What a beauty! It's so intact! Yeah, it's amazing. - An historical find, right? - Yeah, sure is. Oh, you, uh... told anyone the big news? Uh, no, we just found it. Oh, cool. Well, would you guys mind writing down your names and numbers? You know, just in case we wanna get in touch later on. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure we can do that. - Great. - You have a pen? Oh, sure yeah. Hey! Don't move! Do not move! Stop! Go after him. Shoot that fucker. God damn it! Ma'am, do not move. Shit, shit, shit! Fuck! Elli? Elias's voicemail: Come in. Do you copy? Jolly, any visual on the target? Here, he dropped his phone. Looks like he managed to get off this message. To whom did he send it? Here. Well, let's find her. Elias's voicemail: - Oh. - Hello, excuse me. Do you sometimes find yourself thinking about the Almighty? I represent the Society of Universal Brotherhood. My card. Uh... hold on. Kristín. Hey, wait... I didn't know you had a visitor. No, hey, you have to go outside. Hey, listen, friend, we're having a private conversation, okay? Hmm, buddy? Are we good? Let him go! Listen very carefully, Kristín. We have your brother. You say anything to the police about the plane wreck on the glacier or anything else, your brother will die. What? Hey! Salesperson: Sir? What's the update? The initial search of the wreck reveals no trace of Napoleon. We're still scanning the immediate vicinity. - Go on. - The manifest lists six passengers. We've retrieved only five bodies, uh... Colonel Brand is missing. Colonel Brand was in charge of Napoleon. Isn't it possible Brand survived and got away? Widen the search to ten klicks. Without additional manpower and equipment, it's gonna be difficult. I'm gonna need drones with - thermal and sonar scanning. - You'll get them. But for now, work with what you've got. Find Napoleon. Okay. Shh. They flew reconnaissance flights, even sent spies over. But there was never any evidence that an invasion was imminent. The German navy was not big enough - to mount a large-scale... - Karl: ...invasion of that magnitude. Keeping supply lines open... Strategically, and in terms of resources, Iceland was of little value to the Nazi high command. Well, well, well, if it isn't Kristín Johannesdottir. Hi, Steve. G and T still your poison? Uh, no, thank you. I'm good. All right, stout then. Two, please. - Uh, Steve, listen. - Thanks. I really need to ask you some questions. Yeah, I need to ask you some questions. I left you a couple of voicemails, and you never got back. I know, and I'm really sorry how it all ended... Fuck you, man! Hey. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Okay, let me get you a seat. Thank you. What's going on? Um... What can you tell me about something called Operation Leon? Uh, Operation Leon, I've never heard of it. Okay, have you heard about a Nazi airplane crashing into Vatnajökull or something like that? You're talking about Operation Napoleon. Maybe. Yeah, tell me about it. Operation Napoleon is an echo of an echo, but... there was no shred of evidence that it ever happened. And what does the echo say? The echo says that at the end of the Second World War, a plane took off from Berlin to an unknown destination, never to be seen again. It just... ...vanished. Okay. And Napoleon, I mean, stands for what? Well, supposedly, it was code for the cargo of the plane. A secret that could change the course of history. Hmm. How? I mean, like, what? I don't know. Conspiracy theorists would say it's a UFO, or alien technology, time machine, a super bomb. I don't know, it's all nonsense. Take your pick. But could that plane have crashed on Vatnajökull? Could've crashed on the moon for all I know. Where did you hear about Operation Napoleon? Okay. I have to show you something. Oh, fuck! - Wait, hey? - Sorry! - I'm sorry. - Hey, wait a second. Kristín, where are you going? Wait! Hey, Kristín! Wait! - Hey! - Kristín: Kristín, here you are! Hey! Here, here. Oh, fuck! I can't believe I've stolen a bike. I've never stolen anything in my life. He saw your face. It'll take him no time to figure out who you are. - Who's that guy? - I don't know! But he has a way of tracking people down. It's probably through the phone! Fuck! Should've known. Shit! Give me your phone. Hurry! Oh, my god. It's worth like 300 pounds. Fucking hell. Is there someplace we can talk? Someplace safe? - Someplace safe? - Yes. Yeah, maybe, um... I'm pretty sure that's a tri-engine Junkers Ju 52. The green and gray colors on the fuselage and the squadron markings indicated that it was operated out of Berlin. Look, I just need the location of this plane so I can find Elias. Oh, those photos that your brother sent, you should have location coordinates. No, I checked. He doesn't like to be on the grid. Elias, you idiot! Look, I wanna help you. Kristín, I do, but I need to know more. There is no more. This is all I know, I swear. You promise me? You promise me you had absolutely nothing to do with the dead man in your... With the dead man in my apartment? I promise, Steve, okay? Look, you realize that even if you do manage to track down that plane, it's entirely possible that your brother... Yes. But I don't have a choice. Okay, maybe this wasn't a good idea. Wait. I'm sorry. I believe you. Come on, let's see what we can find out. Sir? The woman. Fill me in. The man she met at the bar is Professor Steve Rush. UK citizen, historian, single. I checked his house. Not there. - Set up shop at the embassy. - All right. I wanna know everything there is to know about Kristín Johannesdottir and this professor. Friends, family, anything that might guide us to where they are. Rush has an office at the university. Take a couple of them with you. I can handle it on my own. If the plane was coming from Berlin, it would've had to refuel in Reykjavík. The flight path would probably be close to the glacier, but... Or bad weather, or navigational errors might've pushed it off course. - But that's... a big area. - Mm. Vatnajökull is huge. Yeah, almost the size of Wales. And now, as far as I can tell, four operations were mounted on the glacier from the former U.S. Air. One in 1952, another in 1959. Funny, a large one in 1988. Ostensibly, the last one and the first two were army exercises. But the one in 1967 was part of the Apollo training program to prepare lunar astronauts for commissions on the moon. I mean, they all could have been a cover for something. A search for something on the glacier. Like the plane, right? Maybe. If you knew the exact location coordinates of those four operations, you could transpose them onto this. It might give you a stronger indication of where to look. Do you think you can get those coordinates? No. The American Embassy keeps records of all post-war activity in Iceland as part of protocol. Might find it there. - The American Embassy? - Mm. How am I supposed to get inside the American Embassy? You can't. But I can. I go there all the time for research. We should go. Tommy. Hey, there he is. Always good to have you back, professor. - How you doing, Tommy? - Here for more research? Yeah. This is my Ph.D. student, Linda. Pleased to meet you, Linda. It's a hell of a day you're having. Yeah, you know what? Just ignore that. - Thanks, Tommy. - Don't mention it. - Thank you. - Thanks. Good morning, Miss Moneypenny. - Commander Bond. - Am I glad to see you. This is my research assistant, Linda. Oh, you can sign in here. - Anywhere in particular? - Wherever you want. Thank you. The information hasn't been declassified. Let me try something. The Icelandic authorities have no problem with the scientific expedition on the glacier, but the required permits take weeks to process. The fact that your team landed on the glacier without waiting for official clearance and permits... Well, this could turn into a major diplomatic incident! Everything okay out here? I'm so sorry to bother you, but I need to speak to the Ambassador. Not now, Liz. - That's fine. - Ma'am, it's... Come on in. Take a seat. Liz, is it? What's on your mind? Well... Digital archives, hello. Yes? - I think we should go. - Understood. One second. They are. - Right now. - Yes. - Okay. - Just a moment. Steve, somebody wants to talk to you. So sorry. It's just a second. Steve! Okay. Okay, let's go. Excuse me, sir. Just stay here, okay? We got a situation outside. Requesting backup. We need backup at the main entrance. - Thanks. - Steve: I cross-referenced all U.S. Air Force pilots stationed in Iceland during the period of the two searches. - Really? - Well, chances are high they would've taken part, right? - And? - Well, most were either living off a pension in Florida, or dead. But one person... is still registered as living in Iceland. Really? Squadron leader... Leo... Stiller. There was an address. Do you know it? I mean, not exactly, but it's out of town. Right, let's go. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Yes, sir. - I understand. - That's her. She's got guts. I'll give her that. Thank you, sir. Well, like I said earlier, my hands are tied with the Icelandic authorities. They wanna... send a coast guard chopper out there - and kick your team off... - You tell them that the expedition on the glacier is on the cusp of making a breakthrough in the fight against climate change. It'll be of great benefit to Iceland. I can't perform miracles. Miracles are just a question of incentive. How's your son, Tyler, doing? He's at Harvard Law School, right? That'd be a shame if, say... half a kilo of cocaine was found in his dorm. Do you love your son enough to perform miracles, Ambassador? You know, you never told me you had any family. Besides your brother, I mean. You know, and I never got around to asking you. Why are you still in Iceland? Well, you see, I met this Icelandic girl. I thought we hit it off... and then one day, she just stopped returning my calls. I could've left the country. Tail between my legs. And then I thought... "No, you can't leave now. This is destiny, I can feel it." And voila. Here you are. You are so full of shit, professor. Do you know that? It's true. No, I got an offered a position as a guest lecturer, and couldn't say no. My mom passed away when I was 19 and Elias was 11. And our so-called father, well, he was long gone by then. Last I heard, he was living in a town called Grindavik. You know, we haven't seen him in years, so... I'm sorry. It's okay. Yeah, it's just been me and Elias now for a long time. You sure this is the right place? I mean, there's nothing else around here. Hello? Leo Stiller? Hello? Hello, is anyone in here? Hello? Get out, or I'll ring the police. We'd like to speak with Leo Stiller. Okay, wait, please, we just need-- Now leave. Out! Listen, I have a brother. Yesterday, he saw something on top of the glacier. An old airplane. World War Two, a German one. Please, I need to find my brother. And Leo Stiller is our only lead. Leo is dead. Did your husband know anything about this plane? When he started flying missions over the glacier with orders to... look for anything unusual, it was just another assignment. Word quickly got out that they were keeping an eye out for a German plane. It contained a secret. Some said it was a thermonuclear device. Others thought it was a lethal virus developed in a Nazi lab. Leo's superior, Harry Ingles, had his own theory. He was sure the plane carried - the Walchensee gold. - Walchensee? The gold the Nazis stole from the Jews? Then Harry died. A plane crash. Pilot error. Leo didn't believe that? Leo lost half his family in the concentration camps... It would be an injustice of monumental proportions if the leaders of the free world were to take the Walchensee gold for themselves. Leo and I joined the Icelandic Glacier Exploration Society. A group of laymen who make regular trips to the glacier. We knew it would be enormous luck if we ever came across anything, but... We made friends with a local farmer, lived under the glacier. Ragnar. He helped the Americans with the searches. Years passed, global warming kicked in. The glacier began melting. We began finding things. Come. Jesus. Wow! This is a large-scale map of the glacier. Factoring in all possible movements of the ice over time and the likely flight path of the airplane, we calculated the most likely area for the wreck. However... Ah, yes. In a small stream here, where the glacier meets these mountains... we found this. And... this. It indicated that someone may have survived the plane crash. We hoped to find the survivor's remains, but there was nothing. Gradually... from reading hundreds of transcripts, statements, and correspondence from old Nazis... The picture emerged. A picture of what? A group of people... living in the shadows. But one name kept cropping up. General Timothy Carr. He was part of Patton's third army. In the final days of World War Two, he was attached to a British 21st Army group outside of Berlin. Documents at the Embassy suggested that it was Carr who was responsible for all four major searches on the glacier. That's right, but he wasn't alone. There must have been people behind him. Powerful people who could pull strings. Timothy Carr had a son. William, ex-special forces. He has been in an unspecified position within the CIA... for the last 20 years. The CIA? If you go onto the glacier, you won't be able to save your brother. These people, they'll kill both of you. I don't have a choice-- The basement, back to the basement. Hurry. Are you okay? You can get out this way. Oh, my god! Go to Ragnar's farm, under the glacier. Here, his son Einar still lives there. Tell him who sent you. Now go! No, no, no, you're coming with us. God... - I'm so sorry. - This day has been coming for a very long time. Hold this, hold this, hold this. Come on. - Fuck! - How did they track us? They must've checked the history of the computer in the embassy. Fuck! I should've thought of that. Come on! Fuck! Fuck! Let's go! Steve, wait a minute. Hey. Hey, look, there are people down there. We need to get you help. Come on. Come on. No, it's... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, fucking hell. No. We have to go now. Now, now, now! Where the fuck are you? What the fuck? Get back in the fucking car! Shit! Shit! Piece of shit! Kristín. Kristín! Fuck. Fuck! You wanna hear something interesting? In Russia, in the 60s... Soviets started experimenting with domesticating wild foxes. It was simple. The experimenter held up their hand next to a cage, and if a fox tried to bite them, it was put down. Only the foxes who didn't bite... were allowed to breed. The result was astonishing. Within a few generations, a whole new breed of fox emerged that looked nothing like a fox. Had flappy ears, barked like a dog, wagged its tail. But was it still a fox, or was it a dog? Hmm! You may think you are one thing... but everybody can be changed. Are you Johannes? Yes. Get the drones Airborne ASAP, then start loading the wreck. Not a single trace gets left behind. They got away. And Sarah Steinkamp? She's not a problem anymore. But she has amassed a large amount of information on the wreck. Anything to indicate the location of Napoleon? We're still going through the papers. Well, make sure. Let me know if you find anything. Sure. No, you'll eat them. You must be Einar. I'm William Carr. I knew your father. I remember. Why, you can't have been more than... ten, eleven? I was thirteen. Last time you were here. What, 1988? That's right. Eighty-eight. How's your mother? She's dead. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Mind if we talk inside? It looks just the same. Is that coffee? Would you mind? It's been a long trip. I won't keep you long, Einar. I just got a question for you. Thanks. In the years since I was last here, have you come across any items from the glacier? Um... I haven't been looking. What about your father? He, uh, ever mention anything to you? No. My old man had great admiration for your father. So did I. He was calm, efficient, a man who you could trust with your life. He died too young. I'm gonna ask you one last time, Einar. Have you come across any items from the glacier? I'm not fucking around. If there's something here, my men will find it. There's nothing here. I see a lot of your father in you. Like him, you're honest. Thanks for the coffee. Steve? You know, we could use some supplies, some phones. That's no problem. We can find some phones for you later. Thanks, Johannes. I appreciate it. You're feeling better. Kristín, wait. I'm sorry. Hey. Where are my clothes? I mean, where are my fucking shoes? - Look, I'm sorry. - Jesus. I didn't know where else to go. Anywhere else but here. I think we can trust him. - Trust? - Yeah. This is the man who broke his daughter's piggy bank just to get a fucking bottle of Brennivín. This is the guy who left his family because we were cutting into his drinking time. We need him. Shit! I think we need him. Move it, move it! - Got it? - Yeah. Keep him alive until we find the woman. If we drive through the night, we can get to Vatnajökull in the morning. Then from there, we can find the farm that Sarah Steinkamp was talking about. - This Einar Ragnarsson. - Got you new phones. He's right. By sea will be safer. What if the weather turns bad? So, are you ready to explore the world? - Come on. - Nice to meet you. - Born to be wild. - Johannes: Look after yourself. Echo 13? Shit! Widen the search to 30 klicks. It's a needle in a haystack, sir. Widen it! We're running out of time. Fuck. Uh... Sarah Steinkamp said you could help us. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Well, my name's Steve. Steve Rush. - Steve? - Yeah. Short for Steven. No. Just Steve. Come on! Come on! Mm. More pancakes, Steven? You're a funny guy, farmer boy. I'm not even trying. We know the likely trajectory - of the plane. - Yeah. My father was probably the last person to see that plane. Really? Yeah, in the winter of '45, and when the U.S. Army started doing maneuvers on the glacier in '52, and... kept coming back every few years. My father really suspected that they were looking for that plane or anything from it. The leader of those expeditions... was this man here. Timothy Carr. And the last... big expedition was... scientific. Here to measure the melting of the glacier. That was in 1988. By then, Timothy Carr's son, William, had taken over as expedition leader. On the last night of the expedition, they had drinks together. Long into the night. And very early in the morning, my father woke me up... and made me promise... never to look for that plane or anything from it. He said it would only bring death. Why did he say that? 'Cause it did. Later that day... he got sick, fell into a coma. Two days later, he was dead. Dead? From what? Doctors couldn't find a cause. I think he was poisoned. Carr. I think Carr got quite drunk, said too much. And when he realized that... he knew he couldn't let my father live. Should've killed that bastard yesterday. - Carr was here? - Yeah. Making sure I hadn't found what he's looking for. That means that the secret isn't inside the wreck on the glacier. Yeah, that's right, or he wouldn't have come here. Sarah Steinkamp thinks, I mean, there was a survivor. Mm. Couldn't he have taken the secret with him? Possibly. Quite possibly. Sarah said that she and Leo had found some personal items here in this river. Including a Luger pistol. Esjufjöll? That's close to Snaehetta. What's he saying? But you can't go dressed like that. Whose are these? That's a long story. Come on, yours is in the barn. I feel like Scott of the Antarctic. Yet you look like a penguin. Potato, pot-ah-to. Hey! I'm taking it from here, Steve. You've done more than enough. Well, don't be stupid, you're wounded. I'm already responsible for Sarah's death. I won't be for yours. - Do you own another scooter? - No. Okay, then something that'll get me onto the glacier. Jesus Christ, it's Santa's sled. It's the only one that works. Sir, we're ready to move out. Expand the drone search to 50 klicks. We're not leaving without Napoleon. Pick it up, expanding 50 klicks. For fuck's sake, Einar. Are you gonna help me here or what? Do you know what? We should both go, she needs our help. Well, I'm not gonna break my promise to my father. What did you do? Promise to stand by and do nothing while innocent people get killed? Fine. Fucking hell, Einar, you said you didn't own any scooters. I don't. They're my cousin's! Are you not coming? Suit yourself. Whoa. Sir! Go see what that is. Take me to my brother. Kristín. What's this supposed to be? Where? Let my brother go, and I'll show you where it is. How about I kill him unless you tell us? Yeah, right, and after which, you're gonna kill us both. Let my brother go, and when I know he's safe, you can get your briefcase. Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay. Hey! That's enough! This is a live feed to the national news service. You're being watched by thousands of people right this very minute. Don't come any closer. Fucking hell! No signal. - Put him in with the others. - No, he's coming with us, or I will not tell you the location. No more deals. No. Steve! Steve! Steve! We have a shooter! Fuck! Holy shit! They're shooting at us! Drive it. Have them start the engines! Strap her down. Close it up and get her airborne. - Still checking engines. - It doesn't matter! Do it now! Einar, no! If it gets away, she's dead. Oh, fuck. Come on. What the fuck! Tell the pilot to land the plane. Now! Where's the briefcase? Huh? Where is it? The briefcase? What's in it that's so fucking important? Mayday, mayday, we're going down! We're going down. Brace for impact! Go strap in! Oh, shit! Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Fuck, thank God! Come on. Are you okay? Look. You tell me where it is! Or he dies! No! Look, please! I was wrong. You're nothing like your father. Don't move! - Take it easy! - Give me your guns. We got a man down here. Hand me the guns. Careful! Elias! If you don't mind not touching anything. Einar, for the love of God! Einar! You need to... relax, Steven! Bloody mayonnaise all over this... Mm! So, Steve, we're here. What's it all about? Yes, yes, exactly that! This document... is dated April 14th, 1945. That's 16 days before Hitler's death on April 30th. It's an agreement. A top-secret agreement. A group of Americans powerful in business, the government, the military and, well, who, let's just say, weren't entirely unsympathetic towards Hitler, they agreed to smuggle him out, his wife Eva Braun, and his German Shepard, Blondi, out of Berlin to a remote island off Patagonia in Argentina. Okay, wait. So, was Hitler on board the plane? No. The passengers were high-ranking Nazi officials and Americans en route to Newfoundland to secretly finalize the deal with U.S. representatives. Why would Americans want to save Hitler? Yeah? Have you heard of the Walbrzych train? The Where's Waldo train? The Walbrzych train. Okay. So, the year is 1945, the Nazis have spent years looting the world's most valuable treasure. But the ring is closing in. However, some in high command have been preparing for that exact moment. Gold. Diamonds. The greatest treasure the world has ever seen or will ever see. Unique art, like the Russian Tsars' fabled Amber Room, the eighth wonder of the world! Unimaginable wealth all in one place on one train. There's only one problem. How do you hide the train? Precisely. How do you hide a train? The Owl Mountains, Lower Silesia, Poland. In order to mine metal, the Nazis have built a complex network of tunnels under the mountains. Well, for the better part of 80 years, Every nook and cranny of those mountains has been scoured for that train, the exact location of which has remained a mystery. Until now. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I give you... Napoleon. A map? The plane was to take this map to a representative in Newfoundland and, upon verification, General Timothy Carr, William Carr's father, was to set in motion an operation to ghost Hitler out of Berlin all the way to Argentina via submarine. But then the plane crashed. And the map never made it. Exactly, Einar. The German colonel, Gerhard Brand, survives... but ends up seeking shelter in a cave, where he freezes to death. And Hitler... Eva... good old-fashioned Blondi, all died in the bunker. Oh. Yeah, I get why they wanted to keep it a secret. Mm, yeah. Exactly. But the secret of Napoleon was kept alive. Jealously guarded by a small group of individuals and their descendants, who never stopped looking. So, this map shows the exact location of a treasure train. - Yes. - I suppose... you know, we could always go to Poland ourselves... and find it. Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board this flight from Reykjavík airport. Air stewardess 2: Uh... That's my seat. Well, I didn't see your name on it, Steven. Uh... That's me, 6B. Also doesn't matter where we're sitting. I mean, just pretend I'm not here. Excuse me, Steven, coming through. Hey. You know what? There's something I forgot. Mm-hmm? I never thanked you for everything that you did. Yeah. Well... Thank you so much. You're welcome. You're in my seat. You wash your hands this time? Nope, Steven. Wake me up when we land.
