Connect the electrodes. Thanks to your inventions, Doctor, they won't stand a chance. Lieutenant! What brings you here? An investigation, as always. I've been hearing about your discoveries. How are they coming along? I'd say the stories you we heard have been blown out of proportion. We still have a long way to go, but my colleagues and I are working hard. To what do we owe the pleasure, Lieutenant? Nothing in particular, I just wanted to say hello to the doctor. How is your assistant, Doctor? He's been a great asset. Please, take a seat. What would you like to drink, Elisa? Nothing. Thank you, Doctor. We wanted to remind you about your appointment. My appointment? Yes, with Dr Lowel Today, at 3:30 pm. Oh, Dr Lowel Of course! What would I do without my secretary? We have a very important meeting with Dr Lowel, to discuss cell disintegration. I'm glad you mentioned him. Some of my agents are guarding him, and I believe that you also need protection. Protection? Me? Are you suggesting someone wants to harm me? I am. The same gang that kidnapped Dr Sancesco and Dr Fumagayo. It's three o'clock already. Dr Lowel will be out soon. No funny business! Hands up! Move it! The Masked Man! Hide them, quick! Wait, you aren't the same men. We changed shifts, Doctor. All right, let's go. Mysterious Disappearance of a Scientist Renowned Scientist Dr Lowel vanishes Mysteriously, Leaving No Clues. Authorities Fear for His Life. Send in Agents Sandoval and Enriquez. I trusted you with Dr Lowel and he was kidnapped right under your noses. We had the situation under control, Lieutenant. Believe it or not, the Masked Man helped them get away. The Masked Man? Our best agent, working with them? Do you expect me to believe that? That's what happened, sir. He was acting strangely. He moved like a robot. This is all very strange. Are you completely sure it was him? Yes, sir. You're sure? Is there any news of the Masked Man? He hasn't checked in for 48 hours. These criminals are very well organised. We must leave no stone unturned. I had firm orders from my superiors, and it was my duty to catch those crooks. I decided to charter a speedboat and check out the loading docks. After investigating for several hours, I had unearthed a clue. Dr Campos, we're from the Bureau. How it! Be careful. The Bureau? What can I do for you? Nothing, thank you. We've been assigned to your protection. My protection? That sounds a little exaggerated. Who could be interested in me? The same people who kidnapped your fellow scientists. It looks like they're after the disintegration technique you discovered. Do you recognise those guys talking to Dr Campos? Sure, they're the cops we roughed up. Take it easy. Don't attract their attention. Let's get out of here before they see us. We can wait for the doctor outside. Okay. You go first. I'll be right behind you. Remember, we need our orders. I hope you haven't roughed him up too much. We had to hit him twice. We didn't know that bankers had such hard heads. Turn on the power. What are you doing here? Go and guard the door! Go! Quick! There's someone on the roof! Good morning, Mr Loubé. What's wrong? Let's go. It looks like Elisa noticed something. It doesn't matter. I'll take care of her later. The banker has followed my instructions to the letter. You can stand down. He did it! He'll be here with the money in no time. Soon this country will be mine, and then the world will be at my command! Elisa... Bring Elisa here tonight. ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE Well-Known Banker Disappears After Robbing His Own Bank. Police Put Their Best Agents on the Case. Thanks for bringing me here. I've had so much fun. You've been working so hard since the kidnappings. It's only fair for you to have some fun. Would you offer me the next dance, Professor? Unfortunately, I'm a terrible dancer. But this evening will still be unforgettable. Cheers! Come with us, Professor. We'll drive you home. No thanks, Gerardo. You guys go. I'll go on my own. Or, rather... with them. Elisa... Be very careful, Professor. We'll be with you at eight o'clock. Of course, Gerardo. Let's go. It's past two. They'll be here any moment. That's her. Let's go. This is outrageous! Why take my secretary? Perhaps to get her to reveal your formulas. No! That can't be the reason. I'm the professor's assistant, so it would make more sense to kidnap me. It must be something else. Could she be linked to the bank robbery? Elisa? A robbery? That's out of the question. No, Professor, you misunderstand me. Yesterday, the bank was robbed by its own manager, who then disappeared. Perhaps Elisa knew something. That must be it! She mentioned that the bank manager was acting strangely. That must be why she was kidnapped, Lieutenant. They must think she knows something. And I didn't think it was important... Don't worry, Gerardo. My best men are on the case. One of them in particular. I'm convinced that the scientists' kidnappings and the bank robbery were orchestrated by the same person. Wouldn't you agree, Dr Campos? Yes, probably. I think you may be right. Full house. Lend me some money. I'll pay you back tonight, after the delivery. Aren't you going to feed the girl? She's watching her figure. The doctor doesn't like fat women. - How many? - One. I'm out. If you won't feed the girl, I will. Always so attentive to women's needs. The doctor doesn't like anyone laying hands on his properly. You carry on. I'm out of money. We have to fetch the Masked Man. It's nine-thirty. The doctor wants him here when he gets back. Let's go! Wake up! Wake up! What's happening? Why am I here? - You've been hypnotised. - Who, me? Let's go. I'll explain everything. Where are we? Dr Campos' lab. He hypnotised you. Keep up the act. Okay. Come on! They're waiting outside. The light's still on. These scientists don't get much rest. What's the hurry? Why were you speeding? Don't you know the Maw? Please forgive me, I'm in a hurry. Here, I'm a doctor. I'll let you go this time, but be more careful. Thank you very much. That way. Here are your instructions. - Got it. - I'll see you at the beach. ♪ Come, black cutie, come ♪ ♪ I want to dance ♪ ♪ The mambo, the rumba, the bolero, the son ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want ♪ ♪ Come, black cutie, come ♪ ♪ I want to dance ♪ ♪ The mambo, the rumba, the bolero, the son ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want ♪ ♪ With you by my side, I feel happy ♪ ♪ Dancing a sensual bolero ♪ ♪ And when I feel the mambo ♪ ♪ My blood begins to rush ♪ ♪ Come, black cutie, come ♪ ♪ I want to dance ♪ ♪ The mambo, the rumba, the bolero, the son ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - The conga ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - Oh, the rumba ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - The guaracha ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - The bolero ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want ♪ ♪ The conga ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - Oh, the rumba ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want - The bolero ♪ ♪ Or whatever you want ♪ Haven't they brought the money yet? No, Doctor. We were expecting them twenty minutes ago. Go and see if it's them, but be careful. Dr Campos, I hope you brought the documents. Yes, Mr Kuri, and I hope you brought the money. My bosses always keep their word, Dr Campos. These documents will be in my country in 48 hours. If there's been any deception... you know what's coming your way. Yes, Mr Kuri. I'm fully aware. And I also know that you will pay double for the formula oi cell disintegration. Cell disintegration? That's right, Mr Kuri. It's in this sealed envelope. I'll bring the money by this time tomorrow. - I certainly hope so. - Goodbye. Carry on playing- I've had the documents since yesterday. Very well. Yes, I'll wait here. Let's go. Yes, this one's mine. Please let me know if anything happens. I'll be at home. I'm in no mood to work today. Don't worry. PH let you know if there's any news. Goodbye. Hello? Yes, Lieutenant. I'll use code number 415. Understood. Calm down, Gerardo. Elisa will be back soon. You heard what the Lieutenant said. They have a lead. How can I sit still when we have no news of her? What you need is rest, sleep. Sleep? How am I supposed to rest, not knowing what's happened to Elisa? Nothing like a cocktail to soothe the nerves. I find it quite calming. I hope you like it. Drink up. You'll like it. Come on, kid. You'll feel much better now. You fell for it, you fool! Elisa is mine, and no-one will take her from me. Sergeant, file these. Lieutenant Zambrano here. Lieutenant... Doc... Hello? Hello! Hello! Trace that call immediately! Right away, Lieutenant. THE POLICE ARE PERPLEXED Police Are Baffled by the Disappearances of Dr Lowel and Mr Loubé. The District Attorney Has Ordered That They Be Located Immediately. Hasn't Mr Kuri arrived yet? That must be him! You have your orders, Lieutenant. Yes, colonel No sirens, and complete silence. Understood? Let's go! Congratulations, Comrade! This is great work! My country always keeps its promises. Kuri, pay the man. Everybody freeze! Where's Dr Campos? He got away with the girl Hurry! We might still catch him. Round them up! Let's go! Dr Campos! You're surrounded! Surrender! We'll give you three minutes! They can't do this to me! I own the world! Nothing can stop me! If you don't surrender, we'll use tear gas! You're not going anywhere! Lieutenant, if you want Elisa dead, go ahead and gas me out! What should we do? Go round the back. Wait, Lieutenant! I've- got an idea. I'm coming out! Pull your men back, and no funny business! Dr Campos, I'm your friend! We studied together! No, I don't recognise your voice. Take off your mask, so I can see who you are. I'll show you I'm your friend. No funny business! Stop or I'll shoot! Sure. You asked for it! Call an ambulance, quick! Elisa... I know I've done wrong. Now, I realise that, if I had been different, maybe I'd have won your heart. But now, it's too late. Forgive me. Forgive... Professor... I can't stop thinking about Dr Campos. He was a great scientist. Too much work drove him crazy. Don't dwell on it. You have your whole lives ahead of you, and aeroplanes don't wait for newlyweds! Goodbye. There go my best friends. What happened to the Masked Men? Incognito's injury was not serious. They're both on the flight. Where are they from? Why cover their faces? They are citizens of the world. Their duty knows no borders. They use masks to hide their identity for the good of all mankind.
