Come on, sit down, sit down. - [Fighter] You ain't nothing man. - Listen I want you to use your jab, I want you to control the gap. - [Boxer] He ain't nothing. - Don't take any intimidation from this guy, okay. (ring jingling) - [Boxer] I got him. - Lets go. Come on, man, come on. (fists thudding) - [Coach] Come on, you can take that. Get up, come on, work. Come on, work. (fists thudding) (feet thumping) Come on, work. - That's it, that's it. There we go. - Don't take that. (fist thudding) - That's it, that's it. Yes. - Alex, Alex, Alex, what the hell are you doing, man? - [Alex] That jerk got too cocky. - I told you, you can't be beating up on your sparing partners like that. - I'm not beat up my spa partners. - Oh, yeah, right, let's ask these guys, you just beat the shit out of him. - Well, maybe right, Felix. - Well, listen we've got a big day next week, I need you well rested. Are you hearing me? - You're right. - By the way, your dad's here, why don't you go say hi. - All right, thanks. - All right. - Hey, how you doing, Dad? - That a boy, son, you look terrific. You were great. - Thanks man. - But you're a little hard on these guys, aren't ya? - Yeah, but I need to, Dad. I'm fighting the number one contender next week. The biggest fight of my career. - Speaking of next week. Is Julia going with ya? - Nah, she can't make this one, Dad. - I'm sorry to hear that. You know I'd love to be there too. This damn Hawthorne case, truly bothers me. - That's why you're so stressed. How's that case going? - Oh, it'll be just fine. As long as my witnesses don't panic. - [Harry] Hey, and speaking of witnesses. - Hey, Harry. - Hey, Champ, how you doing? Chief, how's it going? Listen, I just got back from the rounds we talked about. I talked with all the witnesses, everybody's set, they're still able and willing. Just like we'd hoped. - Good. And you have some boys watching them? - Oh yeah, I took care of it. Don't worry about it. - I shouldn't ask. Harry here will be the next chief of police. - No chance, no way. No one could ever replace you at the department, Chief. - [Chief] Ah, you'd come close to second, Harry. - I don't think I can handle the stress. But thanks anyway. - Speaking of stress, we're gonna throw about 180 pounds of stress in the slammer next week. - [Felix] So you really think you have a case? - With these charges, Hawthorne will be away for a long time. - You're right, Chief. I'm gonna head back to the office. Before I go, listen I got those dinner reservations squared away for you. - All right, good. - Hey, good luck, Champ. - Thanks. - Take care. - Hey, we're still on for tomorrow night, right? - Hey, you know me, Dad, as long as you're buying it means me and Julia will be there. - Oh, great, I'll see you two tomorrow night then. - Okay, thanks, Dad. (gentle music) (wave crashing) - Alex, what's the matter with you? Come here. - I don't know. Just under a lot of pressure, you know the fight, my dads case. I've got lots on my mind. - You've being acting crazy lately. Talk to me. - [Alex] I love you Julia. I don't know what I'd do without you. - As long as I've got you, nothing's gonna happen to me. - Told you, I have a big surprise for you. - What are you doing? Stop. (Julia giggling) - [Alex] Well, what do you think? - Oh, my god. - Huh, it's nice, isn't it? - This is gorgeous. (waves crashing) - It's beautiful, isn't it? - It's gorgeous. So what are you up to anyway? - Well, I've being trying to get my guts up for a long time, Julia. I wanna ask you, if you'd marry me? - Yes, I would. - You would? (gentle saxophone music) - Now look, everything's put into plan. The only thing you need to do is wait for my final word and execute it, okay. Don't worry about the old man. You worry about what you have to do. (man coughing) I have to go, I'll see ya, I'll call you later. - Mr. Hawthorne. - You act surprised to see me, Mr. Wang. I hear I could not have returned from my absence at a better time. - Please take a seat, Mr. Hawthorne. - I'm sure you would like to take your seat. (suspenseful music) - How bad is this guy? - He's the major crime lord in this area. He's responsible for about 80% of the drug traffic, racketeering, extortion, murder, prostitution, you name it. And he's involved. - The rumors of your planed takeover of my business pains me, deeply. (suspenseful music) - Those rumors have being greatly exaggerated, Mr. Hawthorne. I've merely being trying to maintain order in your empire. - Maintaining the order in my empire is not your concern, Mr. Wang. Mr. Jones here is very put out about your assumption into his position. I fear your loyalty is in question, Mr. Wang. - I've always being loyal to you, Hawthorne. - Prove it. - What do you want me to do? - Your finger, Mr. Wang. Don't toy with me. Mr. Jones? - All right. All right, I'll do this. I don't know what it's gonna prove. I have never misled you, I've never betrayed. - This Hawthorne guy's a sick puppy. The man is weird. Dad said as long as the witnesses don't walk. He's putting Hawthorne away for life, the guy deserves it. - And Harry O'Reily has assured me that everything's going according to plan. - [Alex] There's a good man. (suspenseful music) (machete whooshing) (Mr. Wang screaming) - My fucking hand. - Alan, Alex has finally decided to marry me. - [Alan] Are you serious? Oh, that's terrific. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thanks, Dad. - [Alan] You set a date? - Well, as soon as the fights are with, we're gonna sit down and discuss things, but would you be my best man? - I would be honored. - [Julia] Cheers. (suspenseful music) (Mr. Wang screaming) - Shit! - Tell your friends, Mr. Wang, I will not stand for betrayal in my organization. You've being very fortunate today. Others will not. - Yeah, them guys are tough, Dad, I hope I do good. - Oh, you'll do terrific. - I was sure come with me. (dramatic music) (Julia screaming) (men scuffling) - Alex! (fists thudding) (men groaning) (Julia screaming) - [Julia] No! - [Henchman] Shut up, shut up. Keep it down. Come on, get in the car. - [Henchman] Ah, come on, motherfucker. - [Henchman] Hey, sack of shit, okay. - [Henchman] I don't care, come on. - [Hawk] Sleeping beauty, time to wake up. (water splashing) Is he awake yet? (foot thumping) (dramatic music) (fist thudding) - [Henchman] Broke my fucking nose. (man groaning) (foot thumping) (gun firing) (Alex groaning) - You idiots. All right, string him up. (Alex groaning) (anxious music) Well, well, well, Mr. Hunter. I see you've had your little fun for the day. - Leave him alone, damn it. - And you, Chief Hunter, I'm very disappointed in you. You've being a cause of a tremendous amount of trouble. But I do have an idea of how you can make amends. - If it's me, you want, you got me. But let them go. - That isn't exactly my plan. Mr. Blackwell? - Who the hell are you? Did Hawthorne send you? - That isn't your problem. You see the problem is, Mr. Hawthorne's best interest towards state care. Don't be shame. See my employer standing trial for a few misdemeanors. So we've issued a gag order. And you're the first to go. (gun firing) - [Alex] Why? (fists thudding) (Alex groaning) - Not yet. (gun cocking) Have something else in mind for Champ here. - Why you doing this? (fist thudding) - You wanna be a hero, Mr. Hunter? - Fuck you. - Tommy, Weasel? (Julia screaming) - [Alex] Julia, leave you alone, you bastards. Don't hurt her. Julia. - I want you to see something that you should consider. - Leave her the fuck alone, you bastard. I'll kill ya. - I don't think so. It seems my two boys here developed quite a relationship with your girlfriend. - Please, just let her go. - You're in no position to ask for anything. Have fun boys. (Julia screaming) (dramatic music) - You fucking bastards, I'll kill ya all. Leave her alone. Leave her alone. Julia? - Mr. Burnett, our friend here doesn't quite have the picture yet. - Julia. - Like father, like son. (fist thudding) - Julia! - Mr. Burnett, I think he needs to be taught a little lesson. - [Alex] Leave her alone. Julia. - It would be a pleasure. (Julia screaming) (head thumping) (fists thudding) (Julia sobbing) - [Tommy] You wanna play rough. (Julia screaming) Feel good, baby? You like that, huh? - [Weasel] Relax, baby, you're gonna enjoy this even more. (Julia sobbing) (foot thumping) - Enough. You two, bring her in. (Julia yelling) - Alex, Alex! - Don't worry, my dear. He's not dead yet. I wouldn't want him to miss this. (dramatic music) Clean the prints off that knife handle. Mr. Burnett, get a gun and put it in Mr. Hunter's hand and sweep this area clean. - Well, did you enjoy the show, Mr. O'Reily? - Yeah, sure. So what's next? - You delivered Hunter to me. I opened the door to your new job. I've even given you a scapegoat. We're forever bonded, Mr. O'Reily. - All right, then why don't you bond me with some cash? - Hawthorne had a small bonus. He trusts you'll finish the job. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You can trust me. - I'll never trust you, Mr. O'Reily. If you touch me again, I'll break your arm. - What about him? - Well, as they say, Mr. O'Reily, the ball's in your court. Come on, boys. We're outta here. - [Tommy] Click. - Jesus Christ. What have I gotten myself into? (chains clattering) Alex? I'm sorry. But some things are bigger than both of us. (muffled gun firing) Oh, shit, you're already gone. (sorrowful music) - Well, I'll be damned. You just never know where you're gonna find a half dead White boy in this town. - Last night, police Chief Alan Hunter was murdered along with his son's girlfriend, Julia Miller. It's not known if the Hawthorne syndicate, currently under investigation being led by police Chief Hunter was in any way connected. According to police spokesman, Officer Harry O'Reily, the prime suspects in the case include Hunters son, Alex, who was seen with his girlfriend and father just us before the double murder. Alex Hunters whereabouts are unknown at this time. Now back to more New Country on Eagle 97. - What do you think you're doing, Hawthorne? Huh? What's the story with Wang? I mean, I'm busting my tail to cover your ass in this town and you go lopping people's hands off. - A punishment for betrayal, Mr. O'Reily. (suspenseful music) You know, it's a pity. I knew his father, you know? Now there was a good man. But enough about my affairs, tell me what you've done? - What are you talking about? - Well, since Hunters body was never discovered, I assume you disposed of it properly? - I took care of it. They'll never find that body underneath that water. And I also made sure they can pin the murders on him. - And you weighted the body efficiently? - I weighted it enough. (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) - Excellent. I like things that are tied in pretty packages. The other matter was handled efficiently as well? - I took care of it. As soon as I told the witnesses they could be next, they bailed. - Your paycheck, Mr. O'Reily. As you can see, you made the right decision when you came to work for me. - Did I have a choice? - Loveliness makes things so much easier, don't you think? Now it's time for lunch. Join me. (Alex gasping) - Whoa, Whoa, calm down, boy. Let me finish putting this dressing on you. Hey, you've being unconscious and feverish for the past week. Ever since I patch up that bullet hole in your shoulder. (Alex groaning) I was wondering when you're gonna start feeling the pain. Here, have a little bit of this. It'll take the hurt right away from you. - [Alex] Who are you? - I'm Joshua Collins, your doctor and savior. And you are in my humble abode. - [Alex] You live here? - Sure, why not? Weren't welcome nowhere else, after I left the VA hospital. I found this old abandoned warehouse and made it my home. Now all the comforts of home though. - How did I get here? - I bought you here, Mr. Alex Hunter. - How do you know my name? - That much I don't know about ya. I'll take that. I've being doing lots of reading while you've being sleeping. You've made the headlines. - Chief Hunter, found murdered. O'Reily suspects son? - Nice looking woman you had there, Alex. - Give me that. - They're both dead, you know? - I know, I watched them get killed. - So how does that make you feel? - What? - What? Don't give me that shit. Just to answer the damn question. - You wanna know how I feel? I feel like shit. I watch them both get killed and I did nothing to help. - [Joshua] So what are you gonna do about that now? - What the fuck am I supposed to do? Everybody's after me. All I got is you. - That's right. You got me. And I'm gonna be the best damn friend you ever had. - Great, just what I need. A black man in a wheelchair. They should've killed me too. - Bullshit, boy. You ain't dead yet. Them feelings you got is called hate. Hate replaces everything. It becomes your mama, your daddy, your best friend. But the trick is to control the animal or it will destroy you. - What the fuck you know about it? - I know a lot about it. But we'll talk more about that later. For now, you best get some rest. - I don't understand. - [Joshua] Not now boy, but you will. You will. (suspenseful music) - [Cassie] Bastard. Get a story. - [Announcer] Officer Harry O'Reily was named Chief of Police today at a press conference held at city hall around noontime. You may recall his predecessor, Alan Hunter was found murdered last week. - Great. - With a female companion. His son's girlfriend, Julia Miller. At this point, all fingers are pointing at Alex Hunter as the prime suspect. - Yeah, he's probably on some desert island somewhere with Elvis, drinking Mai Tais and eating donuts. - [Reporter] Well back to more New Country now on Eagle 97. (woman mumbling) - Hey Charlie? Pour me another drink, will ya? - [Charlie] Jack, you haven't paid for the other ones yet. - Listen, I'm working on another case and I promise I'll settle up with you next week. - [Charlie] Sure, Jack, sure, Jack. - Thanks, kid, here's to ya. - 122. 123. Hey, you ain't done yet. - [Alex] I'm done all right. None of this crap's bringing my father or Julia back. - Nothing's gonna bring them back, Alex. But maybe all of this crap will help you get the fellows that killed them. - That's a bunch of bullshit, man. I wanna know why you're helping me. Surely not the goodness of your heart. - I got my reasons. - Well, how about sharing them with me? Why should I trust you? - All right, Alex, I'll tell ya. Because I want you to trust me. Hawthorne, he's the one that put me in this chair. - What happened? - Wrong place, wrong time. Apparently Hawthorne had it out with this lady. I saw what was going down and tried to stop him. They got my ass instead. Oh yeah, he got her later though. - I'm sorry, Joshua. - What the fuck are you sorry for? I ain't. That's how I learned all about hate. I wanted to kill that bastard real bad. But I was taught how to control hate in the Special Forces. I've being biding my time. Being real patient too. And then you came along. - And exactly where do I fit in? - I can't get Hawthorne myself. So you gonna do it for me (chuckles). You're gonna be my legs. - No problem. So why am I wasting my time, I mean our time on all this shit? I know how to take care of myself. - Well maybe in the ring you do, Alex. But on the street, there ain't no rules. You gotta learn street smarts, if you're gonna go after Hawthorne. - Whatever. Just remember the one I want is a tattooed man. Hawthorne will get his later. - Man, you remember that you've gotta walk before you can run. (rope whooshing) What we're gonna do, Hawthorne is gonna send his tattooed Hawk after us both. And if you ain't ready, I don't wanna be nowhere around. Damn, I seen old ladies in bakers jump rope better than that. (Alex gasping) (anxious music) - [Man] Hey, dude, you lost? - Hey, I sure am, guys. Hey, you guys know where Bill in 301s at? - [Man] There ain't no 301 around here, man. - Oh, shit. - [Man] Hey, do you know what time it is, man? - Sure, it's quarter to eight. - That's a nice watch there. (dramatic music) (fists thudding) (feet crushing) - [Man] He broke my fucking leg, he broke my fucking leg. (fists thudding) (man groaning) (elbow thumping) (fist thudding) (feet thumping) Did you get that motherfucker? Joe, did you kill him, Joe, did you kill him yet? (fist thudding) Joe, did you get him? Did you kill that motherfucker? Did you get him? Oh, shit. - [Alex] Is this what you're looking for, huh? Looking for this? - [Man] No, please don't. (Alex groaning) (Joshua clapping) - Feel better now? - [Alex] Yeah, much. - Dumb, real dumb. Get your ass home. (wood jangling) What possessed you to pull a stupid stunt like that? - I'm sick of this warehouse, when do we get outta here? - I don't wanna hear any of your damn excuses. I can't believe that snuck outta here, looking for trouble. - I'm finding me a test for Hawthorne. - That's not what I trained you for. - I wanted to try to see what I could do on the street. - Try what? Get yourself hurt? Even killed? Is that what you were trying to do? You've got a lot to learn before you can tackle the big boys, Alex. Thinks he's a fucking Superman. Need to know he ain't made outta steel. Look, if we're gonna do this thing under the cover of darkness, you need an edge. Here, happy birthday. - It's not my birthday. - Who gives a shit, man. Just open the damn thing. (Alex chuckling) - You gotta be kidding? - Hey, this ain't no joke. Besides, you could benefit from wearing a disguise. - I'm not wearing this shit. - Looks like I'm gonna have to kick your ass to get you to listen to me. - [Alex] Joshua! Are you okay? (fists thudding) (Joshua laughing) - [Alex] What was that for? - Like I said, Alex, there ain't no rules on the street. You gotta expect the unexpected. Get the hell away from me. You see, it's kinda ugly, ain't it? - All right, all right, I admit it. I do have things to learn. Maybe I should listen to you. I'll wear the disguise. But not the stupid mask. - Well, not all the time. - I swear if anybody laughs at me in this get up, I'm coming back here to kick your ass. - You can try. You can definitely try. (energetic music) Concentration. (fists whooshing) Feet, combination. Let's see it. (fists whooshing) That's it, gonna be ready. All right. (foot thumping) Let's go. Give a shot. (foot thumping) (foot thumping) (foot thumping) Come on, I'm gonna make a street fighter outta you. I'm gonna get all rage outta you. Is that a fact, I'm like forgive me now. Work. (rope whooshing) Come on, now. I wanna see the lead outta you, boy, let's move it. Let's go. (foot thumping) (suspenseful music) (men quietly muttering) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) - [Woman] No, let go of me. - [Robber] Hold still. (Alex groaning) (foot thumping) - [Alex] Hey, get outta here, run. - Yo, I wanna talk to you, man. - As long as I get here. - You got the stuff? - [Dealer] Right here. - It better be pure, man. Otherwise I come back here and cut your heart out. - [Dealer] No, man, not Hawthorne. I wouldn't mess with him. (foot thumping) (Alex groaning) - Tough guy. (man groaning) (fist thudding) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (fists thudding) (man groaning) - We cannot condone killing by citizens. Even if they're bad people. I think we need to turn this guy in. There's a $10,000 bounty. Find him, turn him in, get them off the streets and let the police handle it, Jimmy. - And let the criminals flourish. Okay, look, we gotta get back to regular programming. We wanna know how you feel about this. The Dark Angel. - The Dark Angel. - He comes out of the dark, he offs the bad guys. Dark Angel. - Dark Angel. - I like that name. - It is a good name. - Let's Bob Miller over on the peninsula and find out what they're doing about it over there. - We are at the scene. So you believe the person who helps you is the mysterious Dark Angel? - No, I didn't say that. No, no I didn't say that. - [Bill] Well, could you describe him for us? - I believe he was a five foot black man. - No, no, no, no, he was a seven foot white guy. He wasn't tall. - No, he wasn't. - Yes, he was. - Did either of you have a chance to talk to him? - [Man] I looked at him right in the eye. What are you talking about? - No. He was a white guy. - No, he. - Oh, come, on Cassie, you know who the Angel is? - Well, I've got my ideas, but it hasn't being easy. - What do you mean? - Well you know, none of those eye witnesses were any help so I had to do a little research and I stumbled across something very interesting. - Uh-huh? - Now all I have to do is prove it. - You haven't gone to the police yet? - Hell no. I want this story for myself. - Sure, good luck. - Yeah, thanks. - Hey, Cass? - Yeah. - You want me to walk to your car? - No, I think I'll be okay. Thanks, though. - All right. Goodnight. (suspenseful music) - Hey, bitch, give us the purse. Now. - What are you kidding me? (fist thudding) - Bitch, you want to fucking hit people, come on. - I'll show her. - We've got something for you, huh? Look at this, huh? - Oh, yes. Look at this thing, guys. Look at her. - What she got down there. - Oh, man, I can see what she's got. Man, she is sweet. Let's see what she's got in here, huh? (men chuckling) Wait your turn, wait your turn. Yes. (fist thudding) (energetic music) Hey? (Alex yelling) - Hey, get him, man. Kick his ass. (foot thumping) (fist thudding) (foot thumping) Don't come any closer. - Let her go. I'll cut her, man. Let her go. Julia, Julia. - [Robber] All right. Come on. (knife whooshing) (Alex groaning) How's that, huh, how's that feel. (foot thumping) Okay. (man groaning) (foot thumping) (fists thudding) (man groaning) - [Alex] Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Wait. Where you going? Wait! (foot whooshing) - Hey, how you feeling? - I feel okay. Just a little stiff. - Seems the press has given you a new name. Mr. Dark Angel. - Dark Angel. (Alex laughing) Sounds like a comic book hero. I don't like it. - Well, like it or not, my friend, you are a hero. And it's about time you started acting like one. You best start thinking with your brains instead of your fist. - What the hell's that supposed to mean? - The only difference between the good guys and the bad guys is what's going on inside. Their motives. Get it? Look. Are you fighting for yourself or are you fighting for what's right? If you're fighting for yourself then sooner or later the people of the city are gonna turn against you. And right now with this bounty on your head you can use all the help you could get. (Alex groaning) - I wanna make things right. - Good. Then maybe you are a hero after all. Let's keep it that way. Besides, I'd hate to turn you in for the reward the cops are offering. Then who would I cook for? - Cooking? Maybe I should turn myself in. (energetic music) (foot thumping) (fists thudding) - So, Kurt in today's local tabloid. Today's local tabloid queen, Cassie Wells has stolen our nickname for this crusader who's out and offing the mob. Dark Angel and has written a story about it now. And describing it more detailed but there's still the, she stole, she listens to our show obviously. - She took Dark Angel. She owes us royalties. Are we talking about the same tabloid titillating fem that said-- - Yes, yes. - And I have it right here, Jimmy. Says, nun gives birth to big foot baby. A lot of credibility there. - And Bill Clinton was the father, right? Same woman-- - Boing. - The bottom line is, she's describing the man as having a dark outfit. We didn't even know that when we named him Dark Angel. He comes out of the... Dark outfit and he offs these people. And she's... It's amazing the angle she's taking here. (men quietly chattering) - Out of the way. Back off. Excuse me. (door knocking) - What took you so damn long? I called the police over an hour ago. Would you please get rid of these people? - Er, yeah, sure thing, Miss. Er? - Cassie Wells. - Yeah, sure thing, Miss. Wells. I'll take care of this crowd, stand back. All right you guys, listen. Listen, guys. Listen down there. There's a reward out for the the person who brings in the Dark Angel, dead or alive. Now, it doesn't matter to me how I take you in. Are you the Dark Angel? - No. - Do you wanna be the Dark Angel? - No. - Get outta here. Get out of here. Down, get down. Get down. Outta here. Get outta here. Get, get. Move it, move it. Keep it going, keep going. Next time there will not be any questions asked. I don't wanna see you ass around here again. Well, I guess that takes care of your little problem, Miss. Wells. - I guess it does. That was a little unorthodox, but thanks just the same, Detective? - Jack Cook, but you can call me Jack. - Okay, Jack. Would you like something to drink? - Sure thing. - [Cassie] Great. - Nice place you got here. - Thanks. Say, Jack, would you mind hanging around just a little bit to make sure that these guys don't come back? - No problem. - Okay. I'm gonna get some clothes on. So Jack, tell me how long have you being on the force? - Well, it seems like no time at all. Hey, you mind if I take my coat off? - Sure, go ahead, make yourself comfortable. You know, I gotta tell you, I didn't think anybody was gonna show up. Especially after my conversation with Chief O'Reily last night. He was pretty pissed off when I spoke to him. - (chuckles) Oh really? Well, you know the Chief, he doesn't like to mix personal business and police business. - [Cassie] It doesn't sound like the Chief I know. - What'd you say? - [Cassie] Oh, nothing. So, Jack how's Lieutenant Alysbury, doing? I heard about the shot the Lieutenant took at the attack on 42nd street last week. - Alysbury? Oh, hey, he's getting along as well as can be expected. Doctors say he'll be laid up for a couple of weeks. But you know, Alysbury, it's a shame, he's a damn good man. But it's all part of the job, don't you think? - I think you'd better hold it right there, buddy. (suspenseful music) Lieutenant Alysbury, my friend, is a woman. And now you have 10 seconds to tell me who you really are. - Now wait, wait, I can explain. - Five seconds. - Listen. I got identification right here. - Hold it. Put your gun on the table slowly. - Okay. But, listen, wait, I'm gonna reach for my wallet. I got ID in my wallet. And my gun's not even loaded. - Let's see the ID. - I can't afford the shells. - Jack Cook, private investigator. - Right. - At least you weren't lying about your name. Well, Mr. Cook, you're about to meet some real policemen. - Hold it. Hold it, don't call the cops, all right. Not until you've heard my side of the story. I mean, I got rid of the bozos in the hallway for you, didn't I? - I can't believe I'm doing this. All right, Mr. Cook, have a seat. (Jack sighing) (energetic music) - [Robber] Hey, man, what you doing on my property? (men yelling) - Hey, whoa! - Get outta here, man. - Don't hurt me. - What's he got here, what's he got? He ain't got no money, man. - [Victim] Here, take my ring. - [Robber] Is that all you got, man. - [Victim] That's it, that's it. (dramatic music) - [Robber] Look at this guy. Take him out, take him out. (man yelling) (baton swooshing) (foot thumping) (foot thumping) (man yelling) (foot thumping) (fists thudding) - Come on, come on, man. Come on, get up, punk. Get up, motherfucker. Not in my neighborhood. (man yelling) (foot thumping) (foot thumping) You asked for it. (man yelling) (foot thumping) (fist thudding) (bone breaking) (man yelling) - [Alex] You okay? (spray paint swooshing) - [Vandal] Come on, Mac, we're gonna get in trouble here, man. - [Vandal] No way, you got it. (children quietly chattering) - [Alex] Hey? What you kids doing here? - [Vandal] What a funny looking outfit, man. - [Alex] Get outta here! - [Robber] Excuse me, Ma'am? - [Robber] I've got her purse, let's go. - Hey, that's my purse. (man groaning) (foot thumping) - Come on. - You okay? - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, what's your name? - [Jack] So, what do you think, do we have an agreement? - Let me get this straight. You do all the legwork with my help, of course. And I get the full story rights concerning the Dark Angel. Right? - [Jack] That's right. You get the complete Dark Angel story and I get the reward-- - Half the reward. - All right, all right, half the reward. But look, the way I got it figured we're gonna come out on top. - Especially since I think I know who the Dark Angel really is. - [Jack] What are you talking about? - It's just a hunch that I have. Listen, Jack, I didn't write the whole story. He spoke to me. - [Jack] What did he say? - It was just one word, but it was enough. - [Jack] Cassie, who is he? - Jack, I'm just not sure I have enough to name names. Besides the story is mine, remember? - [Jack] That's just great, great. The curiosity is gonna kill me. - We'll find him before you kill over, okay? Oh, and, Jack buy some bullets for that gun of yours, okay? (energetic music) - I tell you. Hey, check this out. (men arguing) - Hey, hey, I don't want no problems. - Yeah, well you got a problem, boy. (fist thudding) (energetic music) (Alex groaning) (man groaning) (fists thudding) (foot thumping) (man thumping) - You want a problem now, you got one. - [Robber] Let's get outta here, man. - [Robber] No, I don't want no problems, man. - Get outta the car. - What the hell. - Get out the fucking car, bitch. - [Alex] Hey, ladies don't pick hitchhikers. - [Robber] Oh, yeah, asshole. - [Alex] I said, the ladies doesn't pick up hitchhikers. (man groaning) Ma'am, are you okay? - You son of a bitch. (car rumbling) - Two meatball and cheese subs to go. And also sit on two bags of chips. - Okay. Would you like anything to drink with that? - Two large Cokes. - Two cokes. - You got a restroom around here? - Sure, right these doors. - Okay, thanks a lot. - Okay, two subs. (anxious music) - [Robber] Turn around, motherfucker. Get outta that goddam corner, come on and open this restroom. Move, move, I ain't got all goddam night, move. - Don't shoot, don't shoot. - You ain't moving fast enough for me. - Don't shoot. - You wanna die, open up that goddam restroom. - Hold on, hold on, wait. (Alex yelling) (energetic music) - [Robber] Son of a bitch. (man groaning) I'll cut your fucking ass. (foot thumping) (Alex yelling) (fists thudding) (man groaning) (air whooshing) (man groaning) (foot thumping) - Jesus, is he dead? Did you kill him? Oh man. This is a mess. - [Alex] Don't worry about it. He'll never bother you again. - What, it's all right man, I know who you are. I'll take care of it. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, man. I'll owe you a couple of subs. - I understand, Mr. Jones that this so-called Dark Angel is interrupted another one of our shipments. - Yeah. Well I thought your Chief O'Reily was gonna take care of everything. - I'll take care of Chief O'Reily. You see that this doesn't happen again. - Yeah, but what if the Dark Angel comes back? Then what? - I would advise you not to let that happen. (suspenseful music) - Just give me more time. - There isn't any more time. Now I have more important things to do. And remember that big shipment's coming in, I want nothing to go wrong. - Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. - [Reporter] Tell us what really happened? - A guy tried to rob me, got careless, tripped and fell. - So this was an accident, not the work of Dark Angel? - The Dark what? I don't know what you're talkin' about. - [Reporter] Come on, do you really expect us to believe... - Detective, what's the real story here? - Miss. Wells, step back, please. - Detective, the public has the right to know what's going on. - Miss. Wells, when I get a chance, I'll talk to you, okay? Right now I have no comment. Anybody knows what this guys name is? - [Paramedic] No, we had no identification. - [Detective] Oh, Jesus, get him outta here. - Detective is this the work of the Dark Angel? Detective, there's gotta be some answers to this? - [Detective] No comment at this time. - No comment. There's gotta be more to it than this. Damn it, Jack, where are you? - [Charlie] Another glass of wine? - Yeah, please, thanks. (gentle music) - Cassie. - Damn it, Jack, are you ever on time? - I've got a strong feeling of how we can locate the Dark Angel. - Okay, how? - I've got a map today and all the attacks are taking place within a certain perimeter of this area. - Really? - And he can be located right-- - Thanks. - Hi, Jack. - Charlie. How you doing, my man. - Hey, Jack, Jack, I was here today, watch this. Some deli robbery gone astray. Of course the police have no comment. - What the hell does this have to do with the Dark Angel? - Okay, Jack, look, there's something that I didn't tell you. About a month ago, I was working on this murder case, the Chief of Police was murdered. His son, Alex was one of the suspects. - Wasn't he a kick boxer? - Yes, he's a kick boxer. Now, Jack, don't you think it's kind of strange that this guy disappears and then all of a sudden there's this guy beating people up all over town. - Hey, Roxy, how are you? - Ah, same old, same old. - Well, listen, I think that whole thing sounds ridiculous. It's not gonna work. - You may be right. Well look, Jack, I've gotta get out of here, I have a big day tomorrow. I should be off work about four, why don't you give me a call then at home, okay? - Yeah, okay. Cassie? How about loaning your partner money for a drink? - Jack, you are something else. I swear. Bartender, won't you take care of my friend here. See you later, partner. - Thanks. Charlie, set me up. - Yes, Jack. Okay, Jack. (eerie music) - Remember, we only use Karate for self defense. If I hear any of you guys going out looking for trouble, become a karate bully, I'm gonna smash you myself. Remember if somebody tries to hurt us, try to walk away from it. But they really trying to really get you, then you must defend yourself. Huh. Huh. Good, everyone have a good night. Don't kill nobody out there now. See you later. (energetic music) (men humming) - Oh, yes. - Oh, yeah. Getting that feeling now, here we go. - Here we go, go for it, Jimmy. ♪ Dark Angel, Dark Angel ♪ When will you come ♪ Dark Angel, I can't sing, Jimmy Bob ♪ - [Reporter] So what is this Chief, a suicide an accident or the Dark Angel? - I'm sorry I can't answer your questions right now. We simply don't have enough to go on. - [Reporter] What about the angel, Chief? Any leads on who he is? - I can't answer your questions right now. Please just call my office in the morning. (sirens blaring) Rob? Rob, would you get those folks back, please? - [Reporter] Couple more questions about the accident, Chief. - Look, just call my office, I'd love to help you, but I can't right now. - But you will tell me about the Dark Angel, Mr. O'Reily. Won't you? Ah, Mr. Burnett. - [Mr. Burnett] Here are the magazines you asked for, Mr. Hawthorne. - Oh, very good. Do be a dear boy and bring me another Chablis. - [Mr. Burnett] Right away, Mr. Hawthorne. - Since it appears Mr. O'Reily can't do the job, I guess I'll have to find you myself, Mr. Dark Angel. And when I do, I'll have a surprise waiting for you. (Mr. Hawthorne chuckling) (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) (upbeat music) - Hey, what the hell is this. - She's out cold, Mr. Hawthorne. How much of that stuff did you give her, boys? - [Mr. Hawthorne] Oh, get her up. - Get off me. - I apologize for any inconvenience I caused you, Miss. Wells. - Mr. Hawthorne, why did you have me abducted? - Oh, so you know who I am, do you? Since I know who you are, we can dispense with introductions and get right to the point. - You know, it is illegal to have people kidnapped out of their homes? - Kidnapping isn't gonna be as thrilling as what I'm gonna do to you. - Why don't you call up your tattooed trainee, Hawthorne. - Oh, kidnap is such a harsh word, Miss. Wells. Why don't we say we took you for a ride? (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) (suspenseful music) I read your story this morning in the paper but I must say I like your aliens takeover the Vatican much better. If you have any contact with the Dark Angel, you'll contact me immediately. - Look, Mr. Hawthorne, I wanna get this guy just as much as you do. Maybe for different reasons but perhaps we could work on this together? What do you say? - Failure to do as I request will result in my turning the matter over to my associate Mr. Jones. - Get your hands off me. - Now that we have an understanding. Stop the car and put her out. - What do you mean, put me out? Hawthorne, what do you mean, put me out? - [Mr. Hawthorne] That's what I said, put you out. You find your way back. (energetic music) (fists swooshing) - [Joshua] That's it, come on. Good workout-- - Thanks, Joshua. I'll be ready for Hawthorne. - You best be. - Son a a bitch. Drag me outta my house. Drive me off into the middle of nowhere, can they bring me home, hell no. - [Jack] Hey, Cassie, this is Jack. Just checking in. Nothing's come up yet, but I got a few prospects that look good. And how about call me when you come in, okay? - Yeah, Jack, sure thing. - [Answering Machine] 09:04 a.m. (machine beeping) - [Jack] Cassie, I thought you were staying in today? - Yeah, I'm staying in, Jack. - [Jack] Call me, partner. Chow. Where the hell are you. - I'm sitting right here, Jack. - [Jack] Idea of where the Dark Angel is operating from. The rest just takes some pretty old fashioned legwork. See you, kid. - [Answering Machine] Thursday, seven p.m. (machine beeping) - Legwork. Jack, you've got to be kidding me? Oh, Cass, what you need is a good hot bath. (upbeat music) Shit. Okay, Cass. (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I was wondering Miss. Wells, if you knew there was two men watching your apartment from across the street. - You mean to say you're visiting me in my bathroom to tell me that? Well, is there are two men watching me, it doesn't surprise me. Say, how did you get in my apartment? - The door was open. So I figured I'd wait. - Wouldn't you know it, leave it to a kidnapper not to close up shop. - Kidnappers? - Yeah, these two guys come in here, gag me with chloroform, drag me off to god knows where and when I come to who should be my host, Benjamin Hawthorne. This Hawthorne character's really strange. I mean, he is way out there. His sidekick is something else altogether. I mean, there I am lying on the floor, looking up at this guy and I see this hot tattoo on his hand. Its wings were all spread out. - Yeah, his talons roping and extended. As though it was attacking it's prey. - Yeah. (Alex yelling) (gun firing) - What's wrong? - [Jack] Cassie, are you all right? Cassie, are you okay? - Jack, what the hell did you do that for? - What do you mean, I thought you were in trouble. - Jack, what wrong. Buy the bullets so fast. (foot thumping) No don't, please don't, stop. He's working with me. Oh my god, you're bleeding. - I'm okay. What do you mean he's working with you? - Well, he was trying to help me locate you. What about those two men outside? - I have to go. - Jack? (energetic music) (men whistling) - [Jack] I thought we were partners. (door knocking) I thought we were partners? (Joshua chuckling) - Hey, you're home early. I got some popcorn, you want some? - [Alex] Joshua. - What the fuck happened to you? - [Alex] I got shot. - Come on, come here. - [Alex] It's a long story. - Damn it, boy. When are you gonna learn how to duck. Don't worry, Alex. Joshua gonna take good care of you. - Well, Mr. Cook. You seem to have being a very busy little detective. Haven't you? Mr. Burnett. Mr. Burnett has found this interesting map at your place. Bring him here. You seem to have made various markings here and here and here. Might they have something to do with the Dark Angel? - If you think I'm gonna work for your sleazy operations, Hawthorne, you you're crazy. - Mr. Cook, I'd advise you to cooperate. - Blow it out your ass, Hawthorne or whatever else you wanna blow. (fist thudding) - Jack? - Everyone has to be a comedian. Don't they? - Don't tell them anything, Jack. - Do you have any better ideas? Beside, I don't wanna see blood stains on that robe of yours. - [Joshua] Alex? Alex? Wake up, boy. You all right. - What happened? - You come in here last night, bleeding like a stuffed pig. I patched up that flesh wound in your side and you've being sleeping all day. - All day? - Yeah. I've being sitting here board to tears, waiting for you to wake up. - Joshua, I have to get outta here. - Why, boy, what happened. - Cassie, she found the man with the tattoo. - What did that teach you about patience, son? We can always catch the bad guys tomorrow. Hey look, I made you some soup. You need to eat to get your strength back. - I thought you were trying to save my life. - [Joshua] Shut up and eat. - Those Xs represent all the places the Dark Angel has being sighted. And that outer circle there that represents all the places of his attacks. And the way I got it figured, Mr. Hawthorne, the Dark Angel aught to be in a 10 block radius of that center point. All right, Hawthorne, I've explained everything, now how about letting us go? - [Mr. Hawthorne] But what if you're not telling us the truth, Mr. Cook. - [Hawk] So now we get to kill 'em. - Ah, the illustrious, Mr. Jones. And he's quite correct. (anxious music) - He's telling the truth. I follow the Angel tonight down that neighborhood. - Mr. Jones, are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. And he's hurt pretty bad too. At least judging by the trail of blood he left behind. - Jesus, Jack? - Now relax, darling. Your friend may have just saved your life. Or at least postponed your death. Mr. Jones, take some men out to the area marked on this map. I want the Dark Angel located and brought back to me as soon as possible. As daylight's approaching, be a little discreet shall we? And take them to the back room, boys. - [Cassie] Jack? - What's a big idea, Hawthorne? I thought we had a deal? - Mr. Cook, you've never being in a position to make a deal. You and your feisty friend are invited to a coming out party that I'm throwing for my friend the Dark Angel. And another thing. Your tie. Bad choice. - That's gonna be shit outta me. (suspenseful music) - This is it, boys. Get it open. (lighter clicking) (fire sizzling) Where's the Dark Angel? - [Joshua] Go fuck yourself. - I said, where's the Dark Angel? (energetic music) (foot thumping) (man yelling) (fist thudding) (Alex yelling) (gun firing) - Come on, move it, or I'll blow his head off. - Hawk. - You? But I thought you were dead? - Guess again, asshole. - Get him. Tie his hands behind his back. You two are going with us. - So here we are. The metropolis that we are and we're still standing around waiting for the Dark Angel to show his face again. And you know come to think of it, Kurt. - Yes? - Cassie Wells our tabloid queen, we haven't heard from her lately either. - So Dark Angel and Cassie have being missing. They're in cahoots. - That's right. We haven't heard from either in quite a while. The question is, are they in cahoots? (anxious music) - It seems the rumors of your death were greatly exaggerated, Mr. Hunter. Or should I say, Dark Angel? Your little escapades have caused my organization much trouble and a lot of money. It would've being better had you stayed dead the first time. Better for everyone. - Let the others go free, I'm the one you want. (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) - Letting your friends go free is not exactly what I had in mind, Mr. Hunter. And you're in no position to barter for lives. No, Mr. Hunter, the only solution is the old fashioned way. A battle to the death. If you win, then they go free. If you don't... - [Alex] And if I refuse? (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) - I don't think you have a choice. - Don't do it, Alex. They'll kill us all anyway. (Joshua yelling) - As I said, you have no choice. Cassie, my dear, I see the boys have dressed you properly for the occasion. I have a surprise for you, Mr. Hunter. I've imported the best fighters from all over the world to test your abilities. Bring them in. (energetic music) - Some fair fight, Hawthorne. Three against one and he's handcuffed. - Mr. Cook, you're so correct. Toss him in too. - Shit, me and my big mouth. What about that gunshot wound, Alex? Listen, no problem, no bad feelings. - Shut up. Save your strength. - You handle these two big guys and I'll get this little guy. (fist thudding) (Jack groaning) - Bravo, Mr. Cook (laughs). (Alex yelling) (foot thumping) - Some boxer he was, Mr. Hawthorne. - Blade? - I'll take care of this, Mr. Hawthorne. But not with his hands tied behind his back. - [Mr. Hawthorne] Oh, as you wish, Mr. Blade. (foot thumping) (Alex groaning) (foot thumping) (Alex groaning) (fists thudding) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (blade whooshing) (man yelling) (blade whooshing) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (man groaning) (fists thudding) (knee thumping) (man groaning) (Alex yelling) (foot thumping) (fists thudding) (Alex groaning) (foot thumping) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (head thumping) (Mr. Hawthorne laughing) - [Mr. Hawthorne] Bravo, Mr. Dark Angel. (upbeat music) - Alex. This bastard's too big for ya. You can't go toe to toe with him. (foot thumping) (fist thudding) (hand slapping) (foot thumping) You forgot every damn thing I taught ya? Street smart, you gotta out think him. Out think him. - [Fighter] Get up, boy. Come on, get up. Get up. Better sent your little brother here to fight or something. There you go. What's wrong. What's wrong with you, Alex? (fists swooshing) (foot thumping) (man groaning) (man groaning) (foot thumping) (fists thudding) (man groaning) (Alex yelling) - Alex! - Burnet, shut her up. Boys, get this mess outta here. Hawk, get in there and no guns. - Gladly, Mr. Hawthorne. Don't worry. When I'm finished, there'll be nothing left of him. Hey Angel, does this remind you of anything? (Hawk laughing) - Don't do it, Hawk, let her go. I'm gonna rip you apart. - Mr. O'Reily, won't you join us? - You son of a bitch. Your the one what sold my father out. - Alex. - You killed him for a lousy job? - Alex, it wasn't for the job. Mr. Hawthorne didn't leave me with many choices. You know frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive. And from the looks of things around here, you weren't left with many choices either. - Don't worry, O'Reily. When I'm through with him, you're next. (blade whooshing) (Alex yelling) (knife whooshing) - [Alex] You're mine, Hawk. You're mine. - The Hawk, Alex. He's the one we want. (fists thudding) (fists thudding) - Grab the girl, let's get outta here. (man groaning) (Mr. Hawthorne yelling) (elbow thumping) (man groaning) - [Alex] I'll see you in hell. This is for my family. (Alex yelling) - Alex. - Oh, listen, I'm working on another case and I promise I'll settle up with you next week. - [Charlie] Yes, sure, Jack, sure. - Thanks. Good health. - Hey, Jack? - Oh, Cassie. Oh, it's good to see ya. - Jack, I just wanted to thank you for not turning Alex or Joshua in to the police. - Oh, what the hell. I would've spent the money on wine, a new gun and bullets and women, you know. What's that? - Well, that's your share the money for the story I wrote about the Dark Angel. - Thanks, kiddo. - Well, it's only fair, I mean, after all you did help me find him and you got your kicked in the process. - Well that's all right. I'll probably wind up giving the money to some needy person somewhere. - Long as that needy person's name is Jack Cook. - Yeah, maybe, maybe you're right. (Jack laughing) - See you round, Jack Cook. Private detective. - See you around, Cassie.
