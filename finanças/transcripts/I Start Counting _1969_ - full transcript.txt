Good morning, good morning, good morning how you doing? Eat. - Feeling bright and jolly and happy and ready to face the new day? That's good. Tell you what, in case you don't know, my name is Stu Henry and at the moment the time is 8:17. Here we are again. - You're always taking it out on that door. I've told you time and time again. Here, eat your food. There's a good boy. Can I get water? - This place is a palace compared to where we used to live. Oh yeah? Can you name me a palace where the doorknobs keep falling off? What about an early night then one of these days, eh? Grandpa, shh. It's one of his headaches. Yeah. If all he wants is a clear head, a good dose of sods should do it. - If he'd broke his leg you'd say it needed a dose of sods. - Your friend Stuart returns triumphant because Stuart has found the cards. Birds and greetings I promised you, birds and greetings you're gonna get. You must excuse me this morning if I'm a trifle disorganized because I've just come back from a wee project in Scotland with no running water, no electricity, and I'm having a wee bit of difficulty getting it all together and adjusting to civilization. Don't you worry. Quickly say hello to Caroline and Anne. Hello darlings. Caroline and Anne who are leaving in five minutes' time to go to Saint John ll School in Manchester. Today they're both celebrating birthdays. Darlings, I hope you have a beautiful day. - I thought we'd have to go to school on the bus this morning. Morning, Mr. Kinch. Hello Corrine. Wait in the van, will you? I wanna drop this in to Mr. Chapman. - Did Wynne tell you about the lecture we're going to have today? Someone's coming from the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council. A priest. Oh? That sounds interesting. - He's going to answer questions. On sex. Fancy we're not telling you. Yeah. Fancy. - When you're 20 he'll be nearly 40. Lovely age. I can't wait for him to get there. - So that sin may be regarded as anything that stands in the way of real love. And love, real love, grows only from love. And that the best sex education we can give to our children is to love them. To the end. Now has anyone any questions? Yes, Father. Corinne Eldritch. Yes, Corinne? - I've got this friend you see, Father. A Catholic? Oh yes, Father. And she's got this terrible problem. You see, because she's in love with her brother. And he's 32 and she's nearly 15, and she's worried about incest. About what? Incest, Father. Oh yes, incest. Excuse me, Father. Wynne Kinch. Yes, Wynne? I know this girl too, Father. And she looked it up in the dictionary, incest. It said "sexual commerce of near kindred." Which wasn't much help. So she looked up commerce and it said "exchange of merchandise, especially on a large scale." And anyway, she never really said she loves him. Well not just like that. And he's not really her brother because she's adopted and she's the only Catholic in the family because of her real mother. And anyway, when he's nearly 40, she'll be 20 which everyone knows makes a lot of difference. Yes. Well now. If he isn't really her brother, and she's looked it up in the dictionary, as far as an adopted relationship goes... Any other questions? Hmm? Elizabeth O'Connor. Yes, Elizabeth? - What's the Pope got against the pill? - I only asked him 'cause I knew you wouldn't. I couldn't care less. You went bright red. I did not. Yes you did, I saw you. Four please. - And how's my little colleen today? Fine, thank you. - Why does he always think you're Irish? - We found her deep in the woods, I'd say about 100 yards from the bank. We don't know how long she might have been there. They're gonna fetch her now. It'll take a couple of minutes. She looks about 20. She's fully clothed with a raincoat. That's what kept her near the top of the pond. Otherwise she could've been there a day or two. Dark hair, fair skin, no sign of a handbag. I'm waiting for the doctor to come back and I'll call on you with more details. First of all, you have to cut the eels into two inch chunks. Discard the heads. This isn't an awfully pleasant job, so perhaps you could get your fishmonger or your husband to do it for you. You must color one of the onions chopped in butter. Is that you, Wynne? Yes, mom. What are you doing? - Just putting my books away. Won't be a minute. Here it is. The old space helmet. - Had another letter from your aunt Rene Tindle. She's poorly again. She's upset we haven't called. - I said your aunt Rene Tindle's poorly again! What's up with her this time? It's her waterworks. She got a chill in at her friend's funeral. He's done it again. They found another one up on the common. Oh my god. Let me have a look. - Well that's right on our doorstep. - You don't call two miles right on our doorstep. - It would've been on our doorstep if we'd still been living up there. Good thing we moved. Wynne! Wynne! You're not to go to our old house again. Oh mom. Not under any circumstances. They oughta string him up. They gotta find him first. Bloody madman. - Wynne, you're not to go out on your own again at night. But mom. - You heard what your mother said, Wynne. Yes, George. Yes, daddy. - I promised to put some shelves up for Mrs. Bennett. - Her house must be full of shelves by now. Every Friday and always Mrs. Bennett. He only has his spare time. I don't think you'll find it's all spent with with dear old Mrs. B. She's nearly 80. Even sexy George couldn't light her fire. - Your father would turn in his grave. Don't look so scared. I'm not. Only pulling your leg. Well what can I do for you? Nothing really. Oh, I see. - You never wear that sweater I made you. - What makes you suddenly come out with that? - I know you never really liked it. I thought you might've got rid of it or something. Daft. Matter of fact, I don't know where it is. I went to put it on the other day, but it wasn't there. - You would tell me if you didn't like it, wouldn't you? You're a funny little biscuit. - Cheering and clapping in the audience for all the people that couldn't get into the marquee and had to stand at the end of the field about a mile away and listen to the sounds there. I shall play you, with my thanks for a fantastic evening, this little sound coming up for you. Thank you very much.

I haven't seen him for 12 months. - All I'm asking is why. - And I'm telling you to mind your own business. - If your mother sees this what's she's gonna... She's not gonna see it. You must be sick. Me sick? That's a joke. - And what's that supposed to mean? You take it anyway you like, big brother. I'll ask you once again. What's the special interest? It fascinates me, get it? Fascinates me! You've talked to me, I'm bored. Do you mind? - There's no need to run away, Len. Bye all! - Hey, what have you got under there? Nothing. Well your bust has grown then.

Isn't that what we usually do? No. We just invite them to pay us a visit. I used to stand here. Listen to George's bath water running. - How would you like to run my bath, little sister? Oh yes, Georgie! Anything for you, sweetheart! - Now sit down there and don't interrupt me. I need to be quite quite alone and very quiet. Otherwise I won't get through. Claire!

Six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 11. What's going on? - Claire, I'm going to ask you a question. Will Corrine ever go out with old hairy hands in the coffee bar? One knock for yes, two for no. Fat lot she knows. Ask her about Mick Bakewell! - Is it best for her to keep ignoring Mick Bakewell, or should she go for a ride on the back of his scooter? - He keeps asking me, don't forget! Because he keeps asking her. Come on! I didn't know. I thought you were the man who was... I'm sorry, I didn't... Right then, outside. In the van. Both of you. Out. We won't go there again. Out! - I didn't mean it about Claire and everything. I mean I know how upset you were when she was... It's just a game we play. I thought she was lovely too, George. I really did. - If I catch you going near that place again... Yes, George. - This time I'll say nothing to your mother. For her sake, not yours. George. I saw old Mrs. Bennett. She sends her love. - Doesn't even rain on us up here. Rain just passes by. - You'd think if he was gonna kill all these people he'd at least rape them. Seems such a waste. - Len, if your father could hear the things you, not until your aunt Rene gets here. Hello, man, come in. Have you got them? - Cost you a bob each, there's 10 of them there. My friend Jim. Hi. It's raining. - Well come on in and sit down, Jim. Hello. How do you do, Jim? Hello. Sit down. - Tell them where you were this morning, Jim. I was with the law. I'm not surprised. Tell them why, man. They lost a bird who got done. I knew her. Knew her? - Well I went around with her once or twice. - Why did they wanna speak to you? They're pulling all the fellas that she went around with. - They think it's someone she knew? Didn't say. - Well could you tell them anything? - Only what she told me, that she was interested in some other fella older than her. Is that all? That's all she give, man. - So they're not getting very far. - Like I said, I don't really know. - Well girls, killer's still on the loose. But don't worry, it doesn't interfere with you. Apart from the throttling you to death of course. - Len, your father would turn in his grave. - What'd you have to keep on about dad for, mom? You never liked him. George, send him to his room. - Aren't you interested in facing the truth? I've never been so ashamed. You must've been, mom. ' Cause you said you haven't a million times before.

Don't mind me, I'll be all right. Thanks. I... Hope you've forgiven me. I've forgotten all about it. - You'll find someone as nice as Claire was. I know you will. Wynne. - Maybe someone you already know. Wynne! - Who's already very close to you. Wynne! Will you do something for me? Oh yes. Come here. There. A pleasant enough face, wouldn't you say? In fact, one might even say almost pretty. Yuck. Oh yes, pretty. A lot of people would say so and I'd agree with them. A tender adolescent flower. Blooming. Unaffected by the, what'd you call it, the cares of the world. Shall I give you a bit of beauty advice? As to avoid becoming a wrinkle-faced, gray-haired old lady long before your time, shall I? Well stop worrying about me and my rotten old life, okay? - You haven't found my sweater then? It'll turn up. Why do you keep on about it? I just notice these things. As a matter of fact, I seem to remember Len borrowing it. I told my mother I was staying after school for extra French lessons. Because Sister Mary Appleday says I'm stoned. - Instead of which you went to your old house although your mother has forbidden you to go there. Yes, Father. You know that lying is wrong. 'Cause it could cause your mother great pain. Yes, Father. But still you persist. - We were so happy there, Father. Do you understand that? My child, life should consist of more than memories. It not only should, it must. - There's something else I have to tell you. Something much worse. It's about Claire, remember I told you about her? Your brother's fiance? The one who was killed in an accident? - He's not really my brother, Father. Well? - Sometimes I find myself thinking... More and more I find myself... It's awful, Father. Sometimes I find myself thinking... I'm glad she's dead. ♪ Sitting by myself with a secret Dear Lord. Just because you find a bit of old sweater with... Stuff in it. And just because he doesn't go and make shelves for Mrs. Bennett when he says he does doesn't mean anything does it? George is good. And if he tells lies and does things it must be for a good reason, mustn't it? You know how lonely he's been since Claire's accident, they were getting married and everything. And I know you'll understand that I had to get rid of that sweater. Because people always get the wrong idea and that would be awful. I know he isn't a Catholic, but he is good, I promise you. Amen. Evening, Father. Hello, Wynne. Uh... Yes? - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I believe in one God. Almighty Father.

For our sin and for our salvation, He came down from Heaven. - You're not going to, you know, let him? - You say you've done it hundreds of times. - Yes, I know, I mean are you going to a hotel? We might. We haven't decided. - But how will you not have a baby? I've been all fixed. No. You'll tell me what it's like? I thought you knew. - Yes, I know, I mean swap notes. If you like. - And His kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit. Do I know him? Not telling. - Who proceeds from the Father and the Son. - I'll tell you about it tomorrow. If you promise to cover for me. - He it was who spoke through the prophets. And you give me your rosary. The mother of pearl one with the silver caps on the crucifix that George gave you.

What makes you ask that? - I know how much you liked it there. No, I don't go there. But you were there that day. When you caught Corinne and me. Sometimes I go there. Just to look over the old place, but not often. - But you don't like me going there? - Wynne, another girl was murdered last night. You know where they think it happened. Well that's why. - Len says even a murderer must have a family. - Len says lots of things. - But if he does, then one of them might know, mightn't they? Not necessarily. - If they were very close to him, understood him, they'd want to help him. Wynne, this man's mad. He doesn't know what he's doing. Sometimes, most of the time he's perfectly normal, and then he just can't stop himself. - Isn't there anything he can do about it? Shouldn't think so. Then wouldn't it... Wouldn't it be better if he gave himself up? If he couldn't help it, no one would blame him. And he'd have people who were close to him. Who'd stick to him through thick and thin. What are you on about, Wynne? - When people have people who love them, they don't have to worry about anything. Because they've got people who love them. - Why do you ever have to change? - He must be diabolically clever. As well as bloody bent. - It's the poor mother I can't help thinking about. Aye, he'll make a mistake. They always do. If he does, they'll catch him. If he doesn't, they won't. Morning George. See the game last night? No, I didn't watch television. Oh, you missed a great game. Did I? A few goals. Yeah, I read about it in the papers this morning. Still good result. Could've gone either way. - Yeah, fella said that. Well see ya, George. Yeah, okay. On I go. Yup. All right? Yes. Well say it. Say what? How well I look. You look better. Bloody liar. Home at last. Yup. See if you can stay this time. George. Where do you think you're going? - Did you ring her friend up? I don't remember. I can't remember that. She never got there. - Can you think of anywhere else she might have gone to? - Now Mrs. Kinch, when she left the house, do you remember whether she said that she was actually going to call this house, or going to meet... Oop. Oh blast. - She just said I'm going to car. - ls there a cafe that she goes to? Yes, but not at night. Look, I've rung Mrs. Mildred. - Yes, but if she went there... She'd be able to see the house from just out the balcony there. - Yes Mrs. Kinch, but if we could establish that she'd been to this cafe we could go and ask the proprietor... - She wouldn't go by herself. - She may have gone there. And can you tell me how tall is your daughter? I'm not sure. Five. About 5'4. 5'4. And what about the color of her hair? Brown. Brown hair? Light brown hair. - Your mother's given us a description, all right. Would there be a photograph about? A photograph? - What do you mean photograph? Well it would help. That's a bit drastic isn't it? - It's best to cover ourselves straight off, son. - If anyone can help you, it's me brother George. - Why don't you shut up! What does he mean? Ask him. I'm warning you! You're warning me what? - Your stupid remarks, the girl's out there... Stop it! Both of you stop it! Stop it, the two of you, stop it! Hello. Is this her? Where the hell have you been? Been? Been! You're here. Upstairs. In bed. Couldn't have been. Well not actually in bed. I was under it. She's not well. Get her a drop of Aunt Rene's brandy. Come along, sit down dear. And now oh you're peaking, where's that brandy? There, dear. She's stoned. Go on, drink it down. - Exactly which bed would it have been that you would have been under? Mine. - All right, now listen, she's back. In a funny old state, I'll admit, but she is back. Oh, you're going. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Bye. So sorry. I've been half out of my mind. Sorry. Where have you been? For a walk. She's definitely stoned. She is. She is. Who's been giving you drink? You have. I'm nearly 15. Some girls stay out all night. Not in this house they don't. - Wynne, if you've done anything wrong, love, you can tell me. I return as I went. Total virgin. Oh my gosh. I'll tell George. - If you've got anything to say, young lady... Just George. Bed. Come on, Len. She had a jolly good time. I'll have a word with her in the morning, I will. You're too much. All right. If you must know. I went for a ride. Where? - First of all, I went to some sort of hospital. Then I went to this very posh house. And then I waited. And while I waited I got rather thirsty, so I had a little drink. Rather a lot of pale ale. You were in the van? That's right. Why? I was looking for clues. You must admit, it's very good of me. Go to bed. With you. I want to sleep with you. Get out, Wynne. - It's a perfectly normal reaction of a full-blooded female for a full-blooded male. Get out. - I want you to put your arms around me. And kiss me And do things. Things you do to her. Nine, 10, 11. - Well you can't sit here all day doing nothing. Hello. Was it David? David who? I knew. Well I guessed when your mom rang up to find out if you were with us. Oh! What time did you get home? Half past 2. Were they mad? They still are. I bet. Hello everybody. Hello, Mrs. Kinch. Hello you. Oh may I? George is going to... Take you all on a picnic. Oh lovely. Yes. How old is this David? 17. - Well he must be retarded if you didn't have sex. Who said we didn't? You can always tell. Well that's all you know. As a matter of fact. There isn't any David. I knew it. It's George. It's George I went out with. We were drinking. What, carrot juice? Sherry. Not in a pub. You're underage. He'd be arrested. We've got this friend. With a big house. She lets us use it so the family won't know. It's not so much sex between us. It's real love. All his friends understand. They know we're in a difficult position and they're helping us to wait. What for? - Until I'm 16 and we can get married. We won't go abroad on our honeymoon. We'll go straight to our cottage. This cottage we found. It's miles and miles away from anywhere. I'm going to look after him. And keep people from worrying him and everything. Whatever he may have done. What people may think he's done. I'm only telling you 'cause you're a friend of mine. And you'd find out anyway when I ask you to be a bridesmaid. I don't believe you. I'll ask him. You dare? - I know he goes out with other women. That's just a cover. In his heart he's being faithful to me. Because he doesn't want anyone else. Why didn't you tell me before? Shh. We said we'd keep it a secret. That's why if you say anything... - You don't know he's being faithful. He's not like that. - You haven't seen the way he looks at me sometimes. He doesn't. Not when you're looking. You're only jealous. Me? Ha. Don't you spoil it. What could I do? Vanilla please. - Have you got a Napolitano tutti frutti? Eh? Where's my Coke? Get off. Why? Get off. This what you want? You're hurting me. This what you want? Please. You're hurting me. Don't. Stop it. Stop it. You're hurting me. I'll hurt you in a minute. Pathetic little mini tart. You wait. Just you wait. I know about you and your cottage in the country and your real love. You're a dirty old man. You wait! Just you wait! All right. We're going. Corinne. Hey Corinne, George said it's all right. Does he? Well I'm not getting in there with him. I don't want to be raped, thank you very much. - Hey, we can't just leave her there. Why not? From now on you keep away from her. Understand? - It's my fault as well as Cory's. She was trying to make me jealous. I told her things. About you and me. About us going away to get married and everything. Why? It's just that I know that... I understand you. And I don't want anyone to hurt you. Why should anyone hurt me? Well. You know... Go on, out you get. Go on. Where are you going? See if I can find her. But you said... I've changed my mind. - You won't get angry with her again or anything. Will you? She's got a lift by now. This is a waste of time. Hey, wait. I just... Wait. What's up now? You go on. I've just remembered. I've got to do something. You're kidding. Next time you bloody well walk. Wynne! Wynne! Wynne. Wynne. - You said you were looking for Corinne. I couldn't find her. - Is that true you looked for Corinne? Wynne, listen to me. Who is she, George? - What am I supposed to say, I'm sorry? Is that what I'm supposed to say? I'm sorry? - Is it the love sick little virgin? She's a bit young for you isn't she, Georgie? Why did you tell her? You didn't have to tell her. Look at me, Wynne. Look at me. This is me, Wynne, all right? Me. What are you doing? George, stop it. What are you doing? Just come with me. Take a good look, Wynne. In two years' time she'll be dead. Not necessarily from the booze either. You asked about that sweater. It was covered in blood, her blood. I just didn't want your mother to know about it. She needs me, Wynne. I've somehow become responsible for her life and I can't get out of it. Can you understand things like that? Not very romantic I'm afraid, Wynne. I'm sorry, Don't, George. Don't. Can you... What? What'd you say, Wynne? Please. Could you open the door? Where have you been? Well George isn't back yet, neither is Corrine. Hello? Hello. This is your friend Corrine. Only a fat lot you care. Where are you? Wouldn't you like to know. But George was... Was looking for you. Well he won't find me. I'm going to teach him a lesson. No one treats me like that. I'm going to stay out. That'll drop him right in it. Where are you going? - As a matter of fact, I'm with a friend of yours. At least he was. Only it was me he was interested in all the time. We can go anywhere. Coming! In fact I've decided I'm so scared of George I might stay out all night. I know where we'll go. If I see a ghost, I'll give her your regards. Ta-ta. But Corrine. Got a fag? - You didn't say anything did you? What about? You and me. - What, and have her go running to my stupid mother? Anyway, she wouldn't dare. Where to then? I don't want to be too late. Work tomorrow? I don't work, stupid. I do. Sometimes I wish I did. You're not married are you? No. That's all right then. Cory. Corrine! Cory! It's me, Wynne! Cory! Come on, I want to talk to you! Cory! Cory? I know you're here, Cory. Please come home. George didn't mean it. Eight, nine, 10, 11. Corrine, stop it. I don't like this game. Corrine, will you please come out of there! Come out of there this instant. She's dead. Who? She's dead. Are you sure she's dead? You've got to be sure she's dead, you see. There's no use in our running to the police unless we've got our facts straight is there? Will you allow me to do that? Just to be sure? You better show me then. I was outside under a tree watching the stars. And I saw you running to the house. I was worried about you. Oh you shouldn't have come looking for her. You're nice. She shouldn't have been your friend. She was dirty. But I like that now, you know. They just don't seem to know what they're doing. You understand that don't you? They want you to do it. They make you. And then they laugh. They always laugh. And then I feel sick. I get this sick in my stomach. I've never had a strong stomach. You can ask my mother. They shouldn't laugh at me. Don't worry, Wynne! No! I don't understand. You. I'm not sorry. ♪ This year, next year, sometime never ♪ Paper dreams tied up ♪ With bits of string ♪ Changing time ♪ Tomorrow's dream ♪ In between ♪ I start counting ♪ I start counting ♪ Counting ♪ I start counting
