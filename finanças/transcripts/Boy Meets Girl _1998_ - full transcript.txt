Scene fifty six take seven. The ancient Romans had a festival honoring Lupa, the she-wolf, who nursed Romulus and Remus. In the morning, people would exchange invitations to that night's orgies. Under the moon, naked men and women would dance and love across the Seven Hills. Perhaps you know this festival by another name, Valentine's Day. It is three days until Valentine's Day in Little Italy. But first, a boy. Meets a girl and then... [off screen] Magnifico! Where are you my love? Where was I...Oh, yes. It all began in Roma! (Instrumental Music) "Al Di La" You have stolen my heart, Beatrice. Not since Caeser and Cleopatra gas a man so loved a woman. I must say goodbye, Leone. For you know, I belong to another man. Don't deny yourself, cara mia. You left your country to look for love. And love found you. Just silly romantic dreams, Leone, I never thought they'd come true. So if you love me, please set me free. I will not come between you and your promise. Just keep back enough of my heart, for all that I am is love for you. For all that I am is love for you. It's good enough to give them the dribble they want to brighten up their miserable, lonely lives. [Church bell rings] Angelina! Hurry up! It's from Paolo. [Italian] Sonon fretta... Angela how many times I have to tell you, practice your English. I will read it later. I am late for work. Why does he write to you so much? It must be a bum. Paolo's no bum. He is studying to be a lawyer. OK, he's not a bum. He's a crook. No, he's just studying to be a crook. What's to study? [Italian music] "Bonjorno" Angelina, you're late, it's not like you. I am sorry, Judy. "Ma solo Prego..." English! I am..."preoccupapta" You've been preoccupied for a week. Is anything wrong? No, everything is fine. [Children's laughter] [Scolding children in Italian] [Continues complaining in Italian] [Phone rings] Hello...Hi, Helen, you're up early thismorning. Here, wait. You can tell them yourself. Jack! Soylent Green is people! It's your fiancée. Oh, Dearest One! Uh huh...yes, yes, of course Helen. That's absolutely true. Of course, we have the tuxedos. Mike? He'll be perfect. He loves it. I love you, too. Go on, please. [Arguing in Italian] You are so great, so strong, So splendid a lover. Magnificent. A god. You fill me up with love and drown my very soul. [Argument continues in Italian] Italian - the lover's tongue. The muse who guides me to the siren shore. I write a poem of love. I am overwhelmed with "amore". Go away with all of your money, please! No, no. Go! Why do you hide what is so beautiful? If a mortal uninitiated to the power of love, were to glimpse this passionate verse, Their soul would be set on fire, desiring to quench the flames. Nothing else could exist. If you could see through this paper the writing would reveal. The epic love of my truest desires. From you, my muse, I received the poetry. For you, my love, I turned this room into a Valentine, [Italian Aria] [Song continues] [Children's and Grocer's laughter] Your hair looks so nice! "Grazie. Grazie.' Thank you. Good morning, Barker. Up all night again? Me too. You're alright? Run! Yeah, get going. (Women sing Italian love song) Haven't had your coffee yet, Michael? "Tuto bene"? (All good?) Tuto bene, Jack Benny, Benny Goodman, whatever. (women continue singing) [Aria continues] My Darling. Your love enslaves me. Yes, the paper on the wall. Ah, this is too much! The rapture. The Poetry! Mike. You write these photo-romances and you don't even speak the language. Seven languages, I don't speak seven languages, they're all translated. Signora. This is that writer who writes those photo-romances. -Come on. -Yes, this is he. - Really? - Yes! Oh, you write with such passion! Your stories are so romantic! May I have your autograph? A pen...Cardini, a pen! Anna. My name is Anna. Listen...are you married? Perhaps a sweetheart somewhere? Oh God, I don't believe it. It's amazing! Thank you. Bye! Mike. See how happy you made that woman. And I can't tell you how happy that makes me. Michael. You'll never know the poetry in life. This is my greatest poem! I love you. Come! [Italian Aria] Coffee. [Instrumental Music] New shoes. He...he is in love with me! You know I'll pay you back later. She did? Really. Of course you're justified, it's your wedding...our wedding. Sure, Helen. I'll ask him. Mike, Helen just fired Marlene. And she asks me to ask you to ask Judy to be the maid of honor. She fired her maid of honor, can you do that? The bride can do anything she wants. Helen thinks Judy will be a good replacement because she's your friend. Also, she'll fit the dress. She's my ex-girlfriend. Doesn't Helen have any friends of her own? (Whispering) They're all afraid of her. So what do you say? I say no. He says he'd love to, Helen. OK,love you, talk to you later bye. Are you crazy? I said no! How could you dothat? You've got to call her back. As my best man. You have to do this. You have to! Jack as your best man. I picked out the tuxedos. I booked the limousine and licked envelopes. I agreed to laugh at your father's jokes and make scintillating conversation with your mother in law. I reserved your honeymoon suite. Jack is your best man I rounded up all your friends. And I'm giving you a stag because you've been desperately hinting around that you want one for days. As your best man, I have purchased the elaborate decorations as specified by the expensive decorator. And will decorate as laid out in the 18-page manifesto. I will wake you up on Saturday morning. I will shave you, dress you, feed you, burp you, sober, you up. And if need be, I will wipe your ass. But I will not. I repeat, I will not ask Judy to be the maid of honor. I ask one little thing. Oh Don't you think it's a little early to start drinking? Hey, there's only three days left of the wedding. This place is going to look really great decorated, though, isn't it? Uh huh. You want some coffee to chase that? Sure. Scotch and coffee sounds great. Exciting, though, isn't it? I mean, it is exciting, isn't it? Isn't it Mike? Getting married is a big, exciting step! Isn't it? [Italian] Mama mia! Unbelievable, What's he doing to me? OK, slow down. "No Capisco!" "Paolo vera questo Sabato..." In English, Paolo. -Paulo. Mio. -My . Fianzato Fiancé...Your fiancé! Si! He's coming this Saturday to take me back to Italy. I don't get it. I mean I thought you came here to live with your aunt. When I was 10 years old, my grandmother, she was dying. She made me promise to marry Paolo. -That's medieval! -That's Paolo. I have been delaying the wedding for too many years. Now it is time. Last week, I had the dream that a bacala ate a big dog. What's "bacala?" It's a dry fish. So then you had a premonition! And that's why you've been preoccupied. "Certo!" Now I must be true to my promise. So do you love this guy? Is this guy the man of your dreams? [Italian Movie] -Well? -I made a vow. Vow Schmow! Phone him up girl. Tell him it's the new millennium. You cannot escape a vow no matter where you run. Are we going to look good together, dancing that first dance? you sure are. And look, there's Michael. but who's He dancing with? Well, I don't know who he is, but that's not Michael because I don't dance. Uh huh! That's why you're not asking, Judy. You don't have to dance if there's no maid of honor. You always read me like a book, Jack. (Hums a dance tune) A year around the world. Wow. I'm really going to miss you, Mike. No, you won't. You'll have Helen. I know. I know I know I know! And I love her. But this is different. You and I have known each other since we were kids. And we're not kids anymore. Don't you want to fall in love and get married, too? The day I understand a woman is the day I fall in love. You have no sense of romance. I find that very sad, Mikey. [JazzyMusic] Uno! Due! Tre! (Giggles and laughter) No, oh,oh, oh. You animal! Oh, oh...Meow, meow! [Giggles] [Knock at the door] Zia! Angelina! Let's close the door! Angeli! Angeli, Bella! Hey! What are you doing here? I live here. No, I mean why you home so early? I have a problem...I have to choose between... Let's go into the kitchen. I have to talk, it's OK? Of course! What's wrong? Paolo is coming this Saturday to take me back to take me back to Italy. No! I thought you were finished with that stupid guy. -I made a vow. -A vow! I made a vow once too. The happiest day of my life was when we put your uncle in the ground. That's how you get rid of a vow. May he rest in peace my boy. -Something else happened. -What happened? [Italian] What nice wallpaper! The wallpaper man came, he's not finished. - Oh! Senior Cardini! - Good evening ,Angelina. I just brought up some groceries. I was in the neighborhood. You are always in the neighborhood. Yes! Well, its'...it's my neighborhood [nervous laughter] I have an idea. - Why don't you go out? - I just came him in. Yes, yes, I know, but please go out. - I feel sick. - I cannot go out if you feel sick! No, no. I mean, I feel sick if you stay home all the time. You're a young woman. Go out, have a good time and meet people, and live your life. Dance! Put on your coat? - And don't forget you're rubbers! It's supposed to snow. Ah! Hey take the gloves and then [Italian] Go, go! Live for today. Life is short! Bye! I am ready like Vesuvius! [growls] [Italian] "Live life, Life is short" [Italian Love Song] "Al Di La" [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most precious, that’s where you are [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most ambitious, there you are [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most beautiful, Beyond the stars, [Italian Lyrics] There you are. [Lively Party Music] This is great. It's the best stag ever. Thanks man. I love you, man. What can I say ? A man only gets married a couple of times in his life. You cynical bastard. But the trick is not to use too much oregano. You see, penne is very delicate. I hope you guys didn't get me a stripper. [Knock at the door] I'll get it! Hubba hubba, and who might you be? I'm Mrs. Jones, I'm the upstairs neighbor. Here you are, boys. Look, I brought a little food for your party. Jack, go on, try an oyster, honey. Look at you. Such boys having a party and not inviting any girls. So cute. So sweet. Well. Ciao ciao bambini. When I see a woman like that, I just get so...hungry! Food! [Party crowd noise] [Instrumental Music) I got a surprise for you. I found the list! What list? Remember when we were kids and we had the tree fort? The tree fort and the secret club. Remember the list we made up? The list of things a guy has to do to become a man! Let me see that. Look at this, it's written in crayon! Crayon. Smoke, a cigar, go fishing, get drunk. I better check that off. See a go-go girl? It was the seventies, remember? I can't believe you saved this. Get a tattoo, play poker, get in a fight, save your buddies life... Ahh, kiss a woman on the lips. No wonder you never finish the list. Here's my plan, Mike. We complete the rest of the list before the wedding. You and me, buddy. We become men by Valentine's Day. Jack I think the rules for becoming a man have changed since this was written Yeah, yeah, yeah, but wouldn't it be great? Come on, let's make a pact right now. That we'll finish the list. Promise me! Really? It would mean a lot to me. You got a deal. I didn't know there was going to be two of us. Who are you? - "Scusi?" - Hi, Scuzy! I'm Danish – at least that's who I am tonight. God, I have this terrible cold. - [Sneeze] - "Salute" Thanks. So what kind of dance do you do? - Dance? - You know... Oh, si! I love to dance! Hey Mike! Mike! Someone's at the door. You guys, you did get me a dancer! Hi, so where do we change? Ah, just over there. - "Buona sera" - Uh..."Ciao!" Please! You guys! Can I take your coat So. Aren't you going to change? I am not dressed right? No, no, no, it's fine. Dressed how you want. It's your dance. "Vue ballare?' (You'd like to dance?) Whatever. - Si? - Yeah, sure. [Romatic instrumental music] To dance, is to sing with the feet. Two bodies as one in ritualized motion, confined only by the rhythm of the stars [Mambo Music] Where's the groom? [Italian] Mamma mia, what a mistake! I have to go I know you could do it! [Cheers] [Fast-paced music] Wait! Wait, come back! [Music ends] [apologetic shopkeeper] It was so embarrassing. Don't worry about it. It was just a stupid stag. Stag? Yeah. An idiotic male ritual to announce that they've grown up. Only you know what? They never grow up. It never happened. It wasn't me. - I saw you dance. - No, no, no, you didn't. It wasn't me. I don't dance. Who did you dance with anyway? None of Jack's friends dance. I don't know his name. "Uno ragazzo caro." The cute one? Maybe it's one of those sexy models who works on Mikes photo-romances. Who is this Mike? He is, uh...He's Jack's roommate, and my ex, Ex? Ex. As in exterminate. My old boyfriend. He's old? He's young. He's my young old boyfriend. - Anyway, we broke up. - Why? Because I was in love with the man inside of him and he wouldn't let that guy out. Adventure, Jack. Adventure is the thing! I'm going on my trip, Jack. I'm going out there. I'm not going to be held back by anything here. I don't know what you're going to find out there, if there's nothing in here. He definitely isn't your dancer. Mike is a complete klutz. - Klutz? - Ba boom, ba boom. No, this guy was no klutz. - "Abiamo ballato un mambo. - You danced a mambo! And he wrote me a poem. The most beautiful poem. So beautiful, so romantic. In Italiano! I think he's in love with me. Where are you going? To throw up. Then you and I are going to finish the rest of the list. Because you promised and I'm holding you to it. A vow, is a vow. - Do you love him? - No, of course not. I'm going to phone Mike, and I'll ask him exactly who this this romantic guy... - No. No phoning! - Why? I should not know. Because of Paolo? Angelina, you have to take a chance when love expresses itself in dance. No. On the Valentine's Day I'm going to Italy to marry Paolo. It is already arranged. Hair appointments are arranged, vacations are arranged. Now love is not arranged. This Paolo guy, I mean, he sounds like a nice guy, but, you know, what's sometimes nice just isn't good enough. A poet, however, is in love with you. I was somebody was in love with me. What if it's true love? You can't run away from true love Vue Bellare? (You want to dance?) - What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. - Is it me? - How could it be you? I feel the touch of love, and that is always a danger. So very much to lose, So very fragile we become as we cast our hearts to the wind. - Hi, Judy. - No! I haven't even asked you anything. Yeah, well, I'll ask you something. Oh, a little game. OK, you go first. Who's the poet at Jack's stag? If Jack's a poet, I don't know it. How do you know we had a stag? Michael, I don't have time for our usual charming and witty banter What did you want to ask me? How do you like to be Helen's maid of honor? Oh, it's that word...No! Please. - Please, please, please... - No! You don't want Mr. Tickle, do you? No, you keep away from me. And I don't want to have to tickle you to death for one little favour. OK? Find somebody else. Hey, there's nobody else. Just you! - Angelina... - Who? You! - You! - Lui! Me Louie? Me Mike! - You - Us? I am I'm sorry. Did you...what was that for? You never mambo'd me. You never give me a poem. No one's ever given me a poem. - What poem? - She thinks you're an Italian poet. - She what? - Oh, go! - Wait, her purse. - She thinks I'm a poet? Michael... Wait! Stop! Miss! Miss! Comeback! Hold on a minute! Where you going? There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I dont know what happened, but.. It's not what you think. [Italian] Please. Can I have my Purse? What? [Italian] My Purse! Don't you speak English? Here's your purse. Your wallpaper. [Italian] No. Not mine. It is yours. It is yours. No, it's yours! It is beautiful! My name is Michael Lexon. What's yours? Angelina Millefiori. Would you care to have a cup of coffee with me? Que? (What?) Coffee...Espresso. [In Italian] Miss, would you like to have a coffee with me? Coffee sounds great. I got to go back to work, Judy's really stressed. stressed. Oh, she won't mind. I'm sure of it. I can't go out with you. Well, it's not a date, it's it's just coffee. Coffee is not a date. - What is it? - Coffee is just coffee. Dinner is a date. Have you had dinner? I can go for coffee, I guess. Great, I could use some coffee. [Romantic Music] "Al Di La" [Music Continues] "Al Di La" [Italian Lyrics] I did not believe I could ever say these words: Beyond the most precious, that’s where you are [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most ambitious, that’s where you are. Thank you for coffee and everything. Any time. I guess I should be getting home. I've got all those poems I'm working on. Me Too. I mean, I have to go count my Valentines, but yeah, you you get a lot of Yeah? You you get a lot of Valentines? Sure. Lots. Tons! Good night. What are you doing? I'm always forgetting my key. Zia leaves me another one in this tree. - Don't! - What? - -They could be in there. - Who? There's an ancient native legend that says if someone has just lied and they put their hand in a tree. Raccoon's will bite it off. I don't think so. Well, I know it sounds weird, but just in case , I don't say I didn't warn you. - Raccoon's. - Yeah. Teeth, claws attitude. They wash their food, wear fur, vicious little creatures. I don't think so. Ha! Just kidding [Screams] [Instrumental Music] Do you want to go to a wedding? I'd love to. It's on Saturday. I could pick you up at... [Italian] No, Saturday is no good. [Italian] I cannot see you anymore. It's late. I have to go. What are you saying? [Italian] I said I have to go. Why are you speaking Italian? Why are you speaking English? We've been speaking English all night!, No. You and I have been speaking Italian. I don't understand. I don't understand you. I must go. Yeah, you're right. Good night. [Italian] Good Night, my poet. The family called when you were out. They're so excited about the wedding. Everyone is so happy for you and Paolo. Si, I will call them. Come... Do you love him? - Paolo and I will... - I'm not talking about Paolo. Angelina. When you walk away from love You will know that pain forever. And it is not a kind of wisdom. Those summers I spent with you and the family. I was with the people who loved me, and away from someone I had only just married. You was such a part of my life. I want you to be happy. Sweet Dreams. [Italian] Good night Auntie. [Italian] I love you It was just really, really nice, but she thought I was speaking Italian. With words and everything. And I'm not sure that I wasn't. And now I've got to tell her, No you don't. If you want the girl, go with what the girl wants. And fast. I didn't say I wanted the girl. Alright, I want the girl, but I'm not a poet. Learn. Purse...the chase...words hardly coming. Feelings gently brewing...bubbling. As the dew drops in your eyes... Oh, yes! Yes, yes. Yes, yes. Four – one, two, three, four. Blue. B-L-U-E. Blue! And I'm in love with... Seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. [Sings Italian love song] Michael! Mr. Cardini. - Very festive. - Yes. So... What do you know about poetry? Hey, you finally need to experience poetry. It's about time. Seriously, I have to prove to someone that I can write Italian poetry. Someone? - It's a girl. - Ahh, it's about a woman, huh? - Le donne - That! What does that mean? What do you mean, what does that mean? It means... Yeah, I'm not quite following. Italians or speak with their hands. That's all, you know that. Yeah. Show me. No! - Please! - I can't teach you those things. - Why not? - Well, because they're, um. Well, they're personal, that's all. It's not like I'm asking you to talk about it on television. Look, you're not Italian. It's like breaking a code. Mr. Cardini, please. I want to understand. I'm trying to understand. I need to understand. Please. OK, I'll show you what I can. But you must never reveal where you learned it. - Fair enough. - OK, now pay attention. The easiest is the free hand twist. It means, "Hey, you know what I mean, right? - Right" - OK, - Oh yeah. "Hey, you know what I mean. - That's it. Then there's the basic two pinched hands up. It means, "Why do you want from me?" What do you want from me? - Then when you do this,"Ohhh." - Ohhh. Ohhh, It means, "What, are your stupid?" - Nice language. - Pay attention! If you do this variation. It means, "Should I kill them or what?" Uh-huh! Do you have anything a little more conversational? It's all conversational! Just pay attention. Chin flips and hand bites come in three sizes. Hmm. Hmm! Hmm!! Nnn Hnn! Hnn!! Each one is better or worse than the one before... ...Stop... Depending on if it's your gesture or somebody else's. Let's say you're having a discussion with someone. And you do this it means, "I disagree". But if you do this But if you do this, "I REALLY disagree." And when you're doing this "I disagree with your whole family." And look. There's one important thing you should know. Never, under no curcumstances ever Never, never, never, do this. - Never... - Don't do that! Never! Never! What does it mean? You should never know. - OK? - Yeah. But you got to put this in your blood. Because when you do that, then the woman, they feel the poetry, They look at your body – that's it! And they know this man has the poetry in the soul. Yes, I get it! Review. So now... Hey, this is, uh...You know what I'm talking about. Ok, in a discussion you go, I disagree. I disagree. - I Really disagree. - I Really disagree. And I disagree with your whole family! That's it. Bravo! Bravo, bravo! - Pronto. - Pronto. - Grazie. - Grazie. - Ciao. - Ciao. [Italian] Hello? [Italian] It's Mike. Did I get you at a bad time? No no, I was just reading your poem again. It is so lovely. Well, I'm glad you still like it. I had a really good time last night. Walking you home. Oh, me, too.

Would you be interested in having a bite to eat, maybe going to dinner? - Tonight? - Yeah, yeah. Tonight. Lie. Don't tell me anything. Just lie. Mike's worth lying for. I don't know. I must be honest. Are the shoes OK? Meh, here. Use mine. To NOT tell them anything isn't being dishonest. Remember, he's a great poet. He wrote you that beautiful poem. Are you sure I look OK? You look great. I got to go back to work. Call me if you need me. Tonight, the fish is grilled with capers done in a light vinagrette. Ciao, Tutte! Michael? Do you know what you're doing? Do I know what I'm doing, Bo! I'm practicing is what I'm doing. How do I look? It needs a bit of work. Just remember tonight Yeah Whatever happens, Angelina's just a country girl from a different country. OK? - Bueno Sera. [Italian] Good evening.

To celebrate, I am taking you to dinner, to Tratorria Cavalcante where they will prepare us a meal that will almost equal the love that we share. I can wear my new dress. OK, but it's going to get wrinkled. [Staff continues arguing] [arguing in background] [Telephone rings] You answer the phone! I told you to answer the phone. No you answer the phone!

Calm down Stop [Music] Welcome to Trattoria Cacvalcante! Buon apetito, e Favoriche!, [Italian] Greetings! I am your waiter. My name is Pino [Italian] which comes from "Peppino", that would be Giuseppino if you know Italian. [Italian] Call me Pino, okay? [Italian] Tonight is very special at Trattoria Cavalcanti [Italian] We'll make a nice dinner for you and the lovely lady. [Italian] Now wouldn't that be wonderful. [Italian] It's 'Magnifico', no? Il Magnifico...sure! [Italian] Do you know 'Il Magnifico? He's a great poet! [Italian] We've missed him for twenty years. [Italian] So tonight you' re going to have a nice dinner [Italian] A beautiful lady, isn't she sir? Very beautiful! [Italian] So as I was saying... [Italian] What? What is it? Do you have something with maybe a salad... [Italian] Salad is last - Italians have salad at the end. No anchovies. [Italian] No anchovies? We don't like anchovies? [Italian] Yeah. Got it. Yeah. [Italian] Are you happy? Good. As long as you're happy... [Italian] If you need anything just give me a shout. [Italian] What an extraordinary restaurant! You are not Italian. No? No. But you write in Italian. Well, it is the language of love, no?. Have you been to Italy? Actually, I have plans to go. Someday. It is very old inside. But very beautiful outside. Do you ever miss it? Sometimes it's good to leave things behind. [Persistent knock on door] [Italian] OK, Ok, I'm coming. I'm coming! [Gasp] Paolo! [Italian] Is Angelina here? [Italian] Angelina, dear. Your lover is here! You want something to eat? [Italian] Maybe a little bite Ciao. Aldo! Il Magnifico. [Italian greetings] Michael! Hello. Come join us. N o, no, no, we shouldn't. No, no, it's fine, it's fine. We're we're very comfortable. No please Mrs. Jones would love for you to join them. It's such a beautiful dress you're wearing tonight. This? Just something I put together. Ah! Like the four of us here tonight. [Italian] There is no worse desert than life without friends. [Italian] Friends, multiply our joys, divide our woes. There is no worse desert than a life without friends. Friends, multiply our joys, divide our woes. Eh! A salute! Salute! E buon Appetito. Eat! Elma! Brava! Louder. More volume! A sweetheart, Michael. She is such a sweetheart! Yes. She is. Does she inspire you? Well... Michael is writer also. Fantastico! Two writers and two beautiful women. What better way to enjoy good food? The skies are filled with the grandeur and the agony of true love. I don't know where such wisdom of the heart comes from. This soul is like a bottomless wine cask of passion. Tap the soul, and write forever. [Lively Music] [Music Continues] [Music Continues] [Music Continues] May I? It seems your beauty has lifted the curse. Curse? Si. Back when my father first opened Cavalcante's, it happened here. At this very table on this very day, Friday the 13th. Two lovers so deeply in love, they were passionate beyond words. Her husband entered from there. He saw them here radiating passion, their hands locked. Their eyes on fire, their souls... It was beautiful. He screamed his betrayal There was a struggle. Suddenly a pistol, and five quick shots – Pow pow pow pow pow. Since then, no lovers dared to enter our door. Until tonight. Never again a tragedy. "Mille Grazie", A thousand thank yous. Oh, Angelina It is so much better when she does it. I can't go on like this. I got to tell you the truth. The truth, maybe stranger than fiction, but the lie is so much more interesting. Why? Because of what it reveals about the liar. Oh, I must write that down. So so what are you saying then, I should just keep lying to her? A poet writes the truth, which lies at the bottom of every lie. But I'm not a poet. In fact, I'm leaving on a trip around the world. I've been dreaming about it. Everything's been arranged for months. Love is an endless game with many rules from which to choose. Truth is fragile. To win at love... [Italian] I'm going for a walk. But Paolo... Later, later. [Song] "Al Di La" [Lyrics] La, la la la la... [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most precious, that’s where you are [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most ambitious, there you are [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most beautiful, Beyond the stars, [Italian Lyrics] Beyond everything, that’s where you are for me [Italian Lyrics] For me. Just for me [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the deepest sea, that’s where you are. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the limits of the world, that’s where you are... Angelina, I have something to say to you. Angelina.. It's just...you see, I didn't expect to meet you. I was just going on my trip. All my life. I've planned this to go away. My whole life, I always thought that the world was was out there. That my whole life was out there somewhere. And then I don't know. One night, in one moment, my entire world my whole life is here. With you. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond...that’s where you are for me [Italian Lyrics] For me, just for me. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the deepest sea, that’s where you are. Angelina I have a confession. I didn't write you that poem. I don't even speak Italian [Italian] You didn't write me that poem? [Italian] You didn't write me that poem? [Italian Lyrics] Beyond...Beyond. [Song Ends] [Italian] You're a phoney'? - Paolo! - Wh-ho's that? Angelina who's Paolo? [Italian] My fiancé You want to tell me what that is in English? [Italian] You don't speak Italian? You didn't write me that poem? I don't speak Italian. Evero, no parle Italiano. Angelina,he's your Fiancé? Liar! Phoney! Whoa! Whoa whoa! I wish I were in hell with my back broken with my back. I'm a liar? You went out with me and you're engaged? You are the deceiver! [Italian] Come with me! This isn't there way I thought it would play Thanks for helping me with the list, buddy. Hey, catch one I'll let you have it. Hey, how was your date? I was just about to ask her to marry me! And... And her fiancee showed up. And... We got in a fight. That's great! Did you consider the lips? No. Too bad. Well, you must really feel like an asshole. It'll probably make you a better writer,though. You're damn right it will! I can't believe I let here get under my skin like that. What a fool I was! I know! You know what, it's like I had the flu. I was sick and now I'm better. I'm immune. Amen! Everything's cleared up. And just enough time for me to go on my trip. And then you can help me finish the rest of my list before my wedding. Ya ya - as soon as I'm done with this last story. [Italian] How would I translate, "I forgive you". I will forgive you. I will forgive you. [Italian] In part, Because I let you come here alone! I'm sorry, Paolo. "I'm sorry. I'm Sorry". What does this mean, "Im sorry!" I'm sorry means I'm sorry. [Italian] Here in America, everyone says, "I'm sorry!" [Italian] OK, enough! We'll talk tomorrow. [Italian] Think about it. OK. ...Angeli. oh bella. Ok. Ok. Brute! Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming Shut up, you're making my head explode ! Helen. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's the wedding! Yes,Helen, go on. Sure. We'll be ready in one hour. Oh, the the place was hardly touched at all. One hour to go for a very happy wedding in a very clean place. Yes dearest. Uh huh. Right. Oh, my God. Just put them there. Helen, you know the rule. The bride and groom shouldn't really talk on a cell phone on the day of the wedding. Yeah, it's just bad luck. Helen, I promise you, it's a very famous custom. Helen. I just want to know that no matter what happens today, I love you, OK? OK then, bye. Mike Wake up! Wake up! It started. It started Mike, wake up! Wake up. [Music] Throw the bottles with the ashtrays. I got 'em Ashtrays. Bottles. Back there. Jack. I came to wish you very good luck on your wedding day. Is there anything... Oh, dear. We still have a bit of tidying to do. Jack darling. I know that you want your wedding day to be as beautiful, memorable as it can be, don't you? I Think we can achieve one of those? So how would it be if we had your wedding in my apartment? You would do that? That's wonderful! Is it nice? [Wedding music] [Italian] - Where is your passport? [Italian] - In my purse. Oh, the house will seem so empty without you. I will miss you so much. Keep building castles, eh? Oh, Zia! [Italian] What's this? Don't touch it, it's not yours. It's something I'm going to get rid of. Sorry I wasn't there to do all that list stuff . I guess I'm not much of a best man. Mike. I never got Helen the Valentine I promised her for the wedding. Can I use your poem? She'll love it. I don't know, Jack. My poem? You could save my life, Best Man. Save your buddy's life. It's the last thing on the list. All right, but this is your wedding present. Thanks, Mike. For now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known And now abideth faith, hope and love. These three of the greatest of these is love. Hurry Angeli...the airport. Hurry Angeli...the airport. First I'll make him swallow this damn poem! Then we can go. May I have the rings? The rings please? Uhh..right. Mike... It was right here... Mike! Just a second...I'll be right back. Michael! - What are you doing here? - The door was open. Where is Paolo? Waiting. You must take back your poem I didn't write it. I didn't give it to you, I don't want it. Just take back your poem. - I don't have time for this. - Mike stop. Mike! - You're going to take this back right now. - Why should I? It's not even my poem? - You deceived me. - Why didn't you tell me you were engaged? Just take back your poem. [Whispers] I don't know where he is...I don't know! - Just Take back your... - I don't have time for this! Sorry. With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring, I thee wed. At this point in the ceremony, Jack wishes to express his personal vow of love to Helen. I wanted to buy Helen the greatest Valentine I could find. But there was nothing anywhere that could express what I wanted to express. Then when I had just about given up, I found the greatest valentine of all... A poem that my best friend and best man wrote just last night. From the moment you danced me into your eyes, I who could not dance I've heard a rhythm in my soul. From the moment you spoke me into your lips, I who could not speak I have understood a new language. The moment you touched my heart, I who could not reach. I have felt more than ever before, there is a man inside of me, who holds no deception. Imprisoned in the fear of losing you, he lacked the courage to reach. [Italian] Let's go. He lives only for the moment when set free... Goodbye, Kitty. This man inside of me will, for a kiss, be yours from this moment 'til eternity. In moment of the kiss, in the moment of the kiss. Angeli! Angelina wait! Wait! Angeli ! Angelina. Please don't go. [Italian] Angelina. Come here. Now! Angelina... I love you. Angelina. You made a vow. Angelina! I am sorry Paolo! [Romantic Song] "Al Di La" [Italian Lyrics] I did not believe I could ever say these words: [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most precious, that’s where you are. Ah, there is nothing like a wedding. It makes it all seem so worthwhile. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the most ambitious, that’s where you are. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy. The eternal story. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the stars, that’s where you are. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond, that’s where you are for me [Italian Lyrics] For me, just for me. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime. Perhaps I'll send YOU a Valentine [Italian Lyrics] Beyond the limits of the world, that’s where you are. [Italian Lyrics] Beyond infinite time, beyond life [MUSIC]
