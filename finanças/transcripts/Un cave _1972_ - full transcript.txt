My wife fried the onions first, for me. In oil, with bacon bits? Oh no! Buttered. And her chicken legs, she made soft inside... ...and a bit crunchy on the outside. So, sometimes, I said to her "Josette..." What new can we do... It was Charlie, the bartender at the Roxy, who introduced her to me. The youngest of the Bluebirds... and the most beautiful. In the evening, you took her ...to the hotel, on Rue de Ponthieu. What was good right off with her... ...was that even when we weren't making love... ...we were fine together. She could make me laugh. With her little accent, she'd turn you on with stuff. Girls really go for a guy like you. I'll never get one like that. You never know your luck. When I get out, I'll need all I can get to find a job... ...and get married. If that's what you want. Basically, with Janine, at least I learned one thing... I thought I could keep her with money... and when the money was gone, so was she... ...with coppers at my door when I woke up. I wasn't good enough. I wonder why I ended up getting you. You're a stupid little prick. Come on, go to sleep. Granier, to the visiting room. Deferre, to the visiting room. So, Granier, is it for today or tomorrow? Excuse me, Sir... How long can we stay? - Ten minutes. - Thank you Sir. This is the first time for me. Before, my grandson was in Fresnes. But since he was ill, they transferred him. - I brought sausage. - How are you? - Hello, uncle. - Kid, it's the last visit. - I'm very glad. - Imagine what I am! Next time, bring me more tobacco. I give my pipes to my neighbour, and he gives me his leftovers. Yes, big boy, I'll spoil you. Hello counselor. - Hello, Warden. - Seeing you at this hour is rare. I have a case at 3 pm, but I want to see Laigneau today. How is he? Calm. The beast seems tamed. Goodbye. - I don't wish you bon appetit. - Alas! Laigneau! To the small visiting room. - Who wants to see me? - Your mouthpiece. He got his money, I got life. What else does he want? An award? What time do you get out? In the morning. I'll be at your place at 12.30. Good. That's fine. I'll probably be there, but you never returned your key. I gave it, when I checked in here. It's so great that it's all over! You said it! End of visit! Are you coming back on Thursday? Come on, Ma'am. I wrote to her. Even if she doesn't want to come, she can afford to buy a stamp. You're a man, Laigneau. You have to put yourself in her place. I'm already in mine. It's enough for me. I know him, the swine. We know everything here. Let her manage to earn a living, that's all I say... but to stick with such an idiot who plays real estate kingpin... ...and pretend to be his old lady, that's just not on, by me. You're sentenced to life, Laigneau. You'll do 15 years, at the very least. She may want security. Security! Don't make me laugh! People real estate risk prison terms... ...which are worse for them than for us. If she wants to swan around in cars, let her come and tell me... ...and we'll see. What if she refuses? You're in the business... You know we're never completely locked up. We have friends. She and her boyfriend, could catch cold, some day. Be reasonable, Laigneau. Everyone has a right to live their life. Let her come and tell me! How can he make demands? He's in jail. Listen, I warn you, Sir. These are threats against you... and you would be wrong to take them lightly. Laigneau is not nicknamed the Madman for no reason. Psychiatrists recognised him as having diminished responsibility. So what? So what? We don't play games with the fixations of such men. I had to inform you of my interview with Laigneau... ...as I had promised Miss Dietrich. So it's done. Apart from which... Yobbo! What idiots, these lawyers are! I'm chairman of Safimmo, I control Cofric and Fregesi. I'm one of the big five in real estate. I have 3 majority deputies in my pocket... I dine with the minister at his house. I'm up there! My daughter did May '68 with his son. What does he imagine? I won't worry about what a jailbird thinks! When you met me I was that jailbird's wife. His wife, his wife... He didn't actually marry you. You don't have me either. married, and yet... I haven't married you because of Charlotte and the kids. They're not in the way... they're at Chateaudun. You're Mrs Fernier to everyone. I introduce you, I take you out. You've almost become a woman of the world... you work. Don't forget your shitty background. What about yours, are you forgetting that? We are what we are, Catherine. I started at 15... in non-ferrous metals. It doesn't match Janson-de-Sailly for good manners... ...but to learn how to survive, believe me, it educates. So why are you staying with me? It's not for my physique, is it? And my dough, you could easily find the equivalent. I'll tell you, your dough... I know exactly how to hang on. You could pop off in a week. Your age, physique, life style... - I never think about it as much as you. - So what? I'd had a terrible year... ...with a rather terrible man. But you had one thing in common: I had the feeling that whatever happens, I could count on you. - Now I wonder. - Come on, don't get mad! I never dumped a woman. Even Charlotte gets her dough on the dot. And then... ...I care for you. We'll send him a money order from time to time, to your jailbird. But he can stick his threats up his arse! Because there are laws, in France, for honest people... ...and my lawyer, is a former President of the Council. He knows the law backwards! Continue the treatment. - Hello doctor. - Good morning. Sit down. Breathe in. Again. Good. The same thing. - He leaves, day after tomorrow. - Where are you going? Well, that's not bad! But you'd need strengthening... Some treatment at medium altitude. Health insurance? No, doctor. I paid the whole bill. I'll leave a note at the office for the Sana de Vence. - It may be useful to you. - Thank you Doctor. That's what I call a total success. Exemplary! You don't have a sign of your accident. I'll keep you another 3 weeks. Are you sending me back to Centrale? I'm a doctor, not magistrate. I was in charge of healing you, you're healed. Others await your place. I don't give a damn about the others! They can drop dead. So, are you starting soon? Day after tomorrow. Why? You can make 300, by running an errand for me. Don't be offended, Jo. I couldn't do it for a million. What are you going to live on? By working? - Yeah. - The things you hear! I'll do what I want. The life of a sucker! What you've always been. Believe me... ...you don't have to be hip to screw a landlord. It's the simplest scam. Pathetic... that's what you are! So you're going to scram? - Is it true, what you said to Jo? - Yeah. It's funny. Yes. Maybe. That's the way I was brought up. - I was to be an accountant. - Well then! Yeah! My uncle is an accountant, my father was an accountant. And to think that we shared everything for 6 months. It's funny, friendship. It's like love... We believe we have principles, and then we go with anyone. You scram... and I go back to Centrale. And for me... Would you do me a favour? "The Horn of the Wood." Will you remember? Be careful... Seen from the outside, the landscape looks different. My boy! Hello, Auntie! - What a pleasure to be together! - Go and sit down! We've a lifetime to kiss in. I've two good bottles for you. The last ones. - You've said that for 10 years. - Here, sit down there. Your aunt made you a crab salad. And not canned! You liked it so much when you were a child. He's a big boy now. Let him relax. Taste it for me. I saw my friend Brignard. I came straight to the point. The full shebang. "A good guy," I said "but he did something stupid for a bitch." Uncle, I already told you that Janine was not... A bitch! I said "He wants to redeem himself, he has honest blood..." "...his father's, and mine." - Good. So? - It went wonderfully! He put you in the factory of one of his friends. But not in accounting. You'll upset him, with your remarks. Don't worry. Anyway, now I just want to get back... ...and start from scratch. Good on you! You start Monday. That leaves us all weekend together. Only, you must understand... I became a little bit wild. I have to readjust, and... However you want. The last villa before the bridge. You'll recognise it by a large black iron fence. The 3rd and 4th slabs starting from the dovecote. This is where you are. My name's Fraizeur... Abel. What am I supposed to do about it? Pardon. I've made a note of the top 2 floors. I count on you. If I could revisit with my wife... - Tomorrow morning OK? - Very well. No one will take it away from you. Besides, I'm closing. Goodbye. You'll see, she's no showgirl. But I've never seen one like her. What are you going to do? I'm out of here. And you'll see nothing, understand? I'll be an accomplice... get 6 more months. You don't care, do you? You bastard! Help! Help! No! Let go of me! You bastard, get off me! Let go of me. This way, Marcel! I'm here. He had me, the poofter! Warder, Sir... I believe there's been a mishap. Oh, the bastard! See if he's dead. Don't touch anything. I'll notify the warden. Come on, step aside! Get back to your beds! Step aside! What is it? It's Laigneau. He's beaten up Fraizeur. That piece of shit! Doing this to me! Get me the police. You'll see, man, we're going do it nice. I have two closets stuffed with preserves... ...and Bollinger in the cellar. I bought the cabin fully furnished... under a false name right before I got pinched. A light. Everything's cut. Electricity, water... Oh, shit... I'm dying of thirst. Hold on, I brought some mineral water. You pulled it off... like a leader. You really impressed me. I didn't think a straight shmuck like you was capable of it. Me neither. Take it easy, kid. Shouldn't we call a doctor? Eh? I have the weapon. A sword. Father Arnaud... He knows me. He'll come right away. And Catherine... what did she tell you? Well... I was filthy, badly dressed... I didn't dare speak to her. Stay calm. Good God! I told you though... Yeah, but... Me neither... I didn't dare at first. It was after the Bordeaux post office job... ...that I got really confident. Flush with dough... It boosted my morale. This sort, you understand... if you can't follow me... the money side... is, so to speak, a lack of respect. Roses... - There are roses... - Go ahead, tell me. Something for us. Because the Bluebirds... believe it or not... they watch them. When I wanted to screw her... to let her know... I sent roses. Red? Red. Eleven. Always eleven. The twelfth... ...was her. We called the police, but by the time they get going... My compliments warden! Not only did you let Laigneau escape... ...but even leaving a stiff behind him. Bravo! - He won't get far, he was hit. - Of course! Like always. In the meantime, I have to track down your lodger. You have to know what assistance he had, here and in Paris. He sure didn't do it all alone. Find me his bird's address. Caviar, vodka! Who's going to make a nice little dinner with her big teddy bear? What's the matter? Mr Fernier, Superintendent Taillant. Superintendent? What's going on? - Laigneau has escaped. - He what? Escaped. And a man was killed. According to his lawyer, he'll try to reach you... ...to put it mildly. It's our best chance. "Chance"? You understand what you're saying? Perfectly. Laigneau is injured. He's on his own. For now, he's hiding. As soon as he comes out in the open... ...you'll hear from him. Miss Dietrich's home remains under surveillance. Yours too, at least for a few days. If things still go out of control... such as you being shot at, do not give in to any blackmail... ...neither shelter nor money. You have a gun licence? - Well no. - We'll get it for you. Your phone will be tapped, as soon as I get permission. Listening on my phone? What does that mean? And business confidences, what becomes of them? Your private lines. Others can only interest the fraud squad. Goodbye, Miss. If you learn anything, call me at Turbigo 92 00. - I'm going to see the minister. - But nothing can be done. They have ways and means, don't they? What about the Orsec plan? - Go after you? - They've done it to others. I represent something awkward for the government. Hello? Catherine? It's nice to hear from you. It's been a while. What? Who told you that? The police are coming out of my house. Robert, I beg you... if you know anything, if you see him, reason with him. I don't want to see him again. I don't want any more of this. Help me. You have influence over him. The influence, you know... And I don't believe that he will try to contact me. We weren't much in agreement, he and I. And then I also drew the line on it all. But of course, if he does call on me... Bob, we have to convince him to go abroad. It's his only chance. Above all, don't call me at home. I'm calling you from a phone booth. The police are tapping my line. They warned me. All right. Goodbye. SPECTACULAR ESCAPE BY MAD MARCEL It's stupid, but... I already feel better. All the blood that I'd lost... It freaked me out. So, doctor... When do I recover? With your constitution, you'll be on your feet in 3 weeks. The coming hours will be painful. I'll leave you the syringe. I have refills in the car, I'll go get them for you. Three weeks. That'd be bad for me. In 10 days, we scram. Fernier has ten days of respite. Then there'll be his widow... I'll introduce her to you. The great life will begin again. Actually, Marcel, I wanted to tell you... I'm going straight. Alright, I helped you... but I'm going back to being straight. - Oh, you shmuck! - Maybe, but it's definite. I'm fed up with lying to people... ...about how I want to be. You don't realise it... I've already returned to work. Hence my strange timetable. And anyway... ...I don't have what it takes. Listen... ...you can't let me down like that. Well, no. Alright then. You'll get your life back. But I still have a favour to ask of you. Just go see... a good buddy of mine. So... All my stock of morphine. But for a friend... Let him drink, eat and smoke what he wants. Good. But is it really going to take 3 weeks? 24 hours, at most. He's fucked. He's fucked? Well, it's not you who'll operate on him. Me neither. I'm not equipped for it. The liver was damaged, it hurts. You calm him down with morphine. As for the burial permit, it won't include flowers. But your garden's big. It's 1,000 francs. Really! When you've lost your doctor's licence, you have to charge more... Funny, isn't it? He's an animal, you know... Garbage. I only came because I was scared stiff. Now I leave reassured. Come on, get out! So? I'm sure he didn't charge you. No. I won't forget. I'll never forget all that. I'll also swing you something out of my savings. Promise! You can treat yourself to a little Catherine. Great. That's nice. I'm leaving now. I have to go to the factory. Shall I prepare a syringe for you? In case... Say, your pal... Is he a sure guy? Can he be relied on? Mr Jules Bidaut, from Montpellier, asks to see you, Sir. - You said I was in? - Yes Sir. I'll see him in a couple of minutes. Send him in. Sir? I'm here on behalf of someone you know. Yes? He told me to tell you... "Pals always stay pals." So...? So... Marcel can't roam around willy-nilly. So I run his errands. He needs you. And he asked me to tell you... I don't know what he told you, and I don't want to know. There's too much talk about Marcel, right now. He's a childhood friend, I love him dearly and I always did what I could. But then, he must understand that I can't have any contact with him. I can help him out... for the time being. Here's 30,000. It'll buy him time. It's not just a question of money. Excuse me, I have work to do. Above all, he mustn't do anything reckless. How are you, Marcel? I brought you a lamp. It's nicer than candles. I saw your friend Veron. He didn't jump for joy. - Date of birth? - November 24, 1949. - Where? - Paris, 13th. One has the right to choose one's sex. I refuse to sign. We do not have the right to solicit on a public road. Alright, I'll sign. But I will complain... ...to the League of Human Rights. - Sure! Come on, over here! Take this beauty to the women's lockup. 3 carrying weapons, 12 illegals, 2 drug trafficking, 2 stealing from cars, I transvestite solicitation and a bundle of whores. And the Madman? Nothing. Informers freeze up as soon as you say his name. When I think that piece of shit is snoring, while we're... However long it takes, I'll have him locked up. ...last weekend marked again an increase in accidents... of the order of 10 per cent compared to last year, over the same period. Is that you, big boy? Hurry up to the table. We were expecting you. Good evening, kid. Hard work at the factory! You're doing well with your rehabilitation. - Where are you going now? - To wash my hands. No sea trips for at least a week It was 3 degrees last night in La Rochelle. And now, the Laigneau affair... of which we must say it's causing a lot of concern... having been reported to the four corners of France. Let's not forget Lamotte-Beuvron, where, as I said at the beginning, the savings bank was attacked this morning. Who is this Laigneau, whose picture is behind me? What can we fear from him? Where are the police? So many questions, that have brought together in the studio some people capable of enlightening us, and first of all, Superintendent Taillant, in charge of the search. Firstly, I believe I can reassure the public. Operations are on track. The noose is tightening around the one to whom certain media do too much honour, by calling him public enemy number one. There is still the legend around him. Notably, this case of 200 million old francs, but still a lot. from the Galleries, which have never been found. Indeed, Laigneau, arrested 8 days after the hold-up, never confessed where the money was. Nor the names of the accomplices to whom he had entrusted it. We invited the installer of the protection system... Mr Veron, electronics engineer, to help us unravel the mystery of the Galleries. In fact, there is no mystery of the Galleries. The protection system, I demonstrated without difficulty, was particularly effective. Let's ask Francois de Closet to give us his feelings. In fact, this system looks clever, and we had a model made to explain it to you. You will see on this slide the system itself. In front of the vault entrance, you have a series of ray-transceivers. These are invisible rays, infrared rays, but for the explanation, we have represented them here in the form of light rays. If you cut this signal, you immediately set off an alarm, both at the night watchman's and the nearest police station. So, the whole point of this system, of this Verorayon, named after its inventor, is to avoid nuisance alarms, because such a system is so sensitive that the slightest incident, a moth at night, would set it off, which has already happened. The alarm is triggered, with all the fuss. So how do we do it? Well, these receivers have a response time, or if you want, an inertia of half a second. Look. If I pass my hand very quickly, like this, nothing happens. If, on the other hand, I pass it slowly, like this... I triggered the alarm. But it takes more than half a second to cross this network of rays, and yet, Laigneau, he, did not trigger the alarm. That is why there is no mystery. The complicity of the watchman who broke the circuit, is obvious. The watchman was murdered immediately after the operation, but Laigneau always denied the murder. Can I change the channel? - These gangsters scare me. - You're right, Auntie. Ah! More gangsters, they're everywhere. Fantastic, Mr Veron! Mr Veron, please. I thought of one thing during the show. - Can I tell you about it? - You're welcome. In this system, the receiver triggers the alarm if it no longer receives the ray. So suppose this is a ray-torch. I expose it to the receiver. I pass behind and I remove the ray-torch. And the receiver didn't trigger the alarm. It should, a moving ray-torch. Yes... but with miniaturization... Laigneau is illiterate. I don't think he could imagine such a device. - Pity. It was fun. - Yes. And There you go! Laigneau, Laigneau... Blamed for everything! It's Laigneau. From Marseille... ...to the U.S? Where are we at? What are you doing here? We were let in. This young man would like to talk to you, Sir. Sit down. Go ahead, my man. I wanted to get away. But my uncle told me it was better to warn you. So, here I go. You're getting away? From where? Why? Who are you? Georges Granier. George Graniers. Well then... I was 6 months with Laigneau. The newspapers say that he is on the run. As for me... I'll get away, because I know him. Granier, Georges, Henri... Marcel. Henri, like his father, and Marcel, like me. He's a good little guy. Ah, amazing, even! Ward 7, confidence trick, false signature, bounced cheque, 2 years minimum. He loved a good-for-nothing girl. No, Uncle, Janine's not a good-for-nothing girl. That's it, yes? Tell me about Laigneau. A total brute! A bastard! Did you know his plans? Oh! It was not difficult to know. Shoot everyone... the judge, the cops, His missus, the guy she's with, named Fernier, and then me. Joe, the warden... As long as he was locked up, just talking! But now... Because he knows my uncle's address. Then me, I have a doctor's referral... ...for the Vence sanatorium. So. I'm out of here, before he comes. He made the right move. He no longer wants to hear about the underworld. If he threatens me with a gun saying: "You little shmuck, "...you're going to help me." What do I do? "Little shmuck"? The word for anyone straight. Oh, I know! I know. So you'd like to go to the Sana de Vence... ...and your uncle told you to ask my permission? I was right. The police are men like anyone else. Not a bad sort. Well, since you've made up your mind, you leave. But... by the rules! Yes, Uncle, you were right! It was better. Granier's gone! He didn't show up for work. And there's no uncle at the given address. -Ah, Tunel! Damn it, Tunel! He won't change. He's out of here, your little chap! He can hitchhike to Vence with my blessing! Even you would have understood ...that Laigneau and he were not in cahoots. It's not because this is my lead... Exactly, yes! As luck would have it... ...we come across a shmuck who's freaking out. A seedy little nobody, isn't that all he is? Already? He's making a hell of a fuss. He wants to see you. - When? - Now. I'll take you. I'm very busy. What does he imagine? That you don't give a damn about him. And he doesn't want help for the time being. He wants it all. All? That's what he said... "All." He's crazy. I can't get 800,000 just like that. Marcel was never very realistic. Such a large sum! We'd better believe that he's become realistic... ...and above all in a hurry. He wants his 800 grand right away. Listen... give me 2 days. Two days! It's reasonable. I'll do the impossible. I'll sell, borrow... I don't have it... But tomorrow, half... All of it! Where will he come? Not here. That would be madness! Oh yes! But he knows about madness. All right. All. But tomorrow. Or rather, the day after tomorrow. - Morning? - Morning. This sort, you understand, if you can't follow me, the money side, It is, so to speak, a lack of respect. I'm going to open a file for you... No, stop! - But... - No... no file. You're not the first agency that I've contacted. Last name, first name, age, profession, address... And you're flooded with proposals of no interest. But tell me what you're looking for. I can show you pictures, plans, that we can study. Alright, I'll tell you what I'm looking for. I am looking for an agency without a file, without plans and without photos... with someone nice like you, who would say to me... "Alright. We're going show you on the spot." It's true. For me, with a house, I want to have love at first sight. Hello. The Vence sanatorium? It this the director or information? The Secretary? Good. This is the CID. Police officer Tunel. You'll a new patient... Granier, Georges. Within 48 hours. Yes. He's a guy coming out of the slammer. So we... Prison! Good. As soon as he shows up, you'll let me know. Police officer Tunel. Take my number. Note. In case you change your mind... I wrote down my private number on the back. Oh no! I'll keep my morning for you. Alright. Thanks. See you then. Eleven. Always eleven. The twelfth... was her. Miss Catherine? - Yes. - From a gentleman. Which gentlemen? A gentleman like all gentlemen'. Thank you. Eleven. It's him! I'm sure of it. He always sent eleven roses. Never twelve or ten. Eleven was his number. You're crazy! The saleswoman got it wrong. She forgot one. Extraordinary coincidence! Coincidences always are. Maybe it's Lepage. He was always chatting you up. Or the Negro from Safreco in Abidjan. Answer, if you want. I'm not here for anyone. Hello? Hello? What is it? Hello. Roland Fernier. Hello? Who's calling? It's you, eh? If it's you, say so, damn it...! It happens. You know, the phone right now... Roses! There are fingerprints on it... And the phone! It's a trace. You'll stick with it, I hope. It won't do anything. I repeat what I told you on the first day... My best bet is you. Laigneau's no moron. He's a cunning madman... ...a tiger. I'm cunning too. I wait for it, as they wait a tiger, with a goat... ...which serves as bait. Listen carefully, Taillant. Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. The goat, on leaving here... ...runs straight to the prefect and you're screwed, old boy. You can prepare a bag of tear gas. No more cushy job... You'll be out on crowd-control. Sorry to disappoint you, Mr Fernier... ...but I received a note about you from the Interior Ministry... ...warmly recommending your protection... "...but without taking into account "the abuse of officials made by this person." "We will stick to the operations democratically acceptable, "as due to all the citizens." Do you understand? It means that they are starting to let go of me. The cocksuckers! After the dues I've paid! You pack your suitcase and wait for me at the Hotel Scribe. I'd be surprised if that thug could get in there. Here. 600, 700, 800,000 francs. I have it, anyway. It's not possible! That would be really too stupid. Catherine! Catherine! Robert? I thought it was... Well, you see, It's not him. Not quite. What do you mean? - I saw Marcel again. - How is he? Physically, rather better. Otherwise, crazier than ever. Which doesn't help matters for Fernier. Didn't help. Because I was able to reason with him, he wants a million. With that, he drops out and goes abroad. - But, how can you get... - Fernier. Roland? It's impossible! I know his him. It's that or his skin. A million? That takes the cake! He told you that? Not him, I said! His go-between. And the go-between is someone that you know? Of course! But in this moment, I’m inclined to save. - A thousand grand! - Don't try to tell the police. I swore absolute secrecy. Wait! I've made my decision... If you do that, I'm leaving you. In short, you prefer this thug to a man... ...pissed off, but respectable. He's desperate. He needs this money. If he has it, he can get away. And if he gave his word... It's not one of your little deputies. Roland, you say it yourself, he's a thug. So his word matters. Think. You still have 48 hours. Alright. Tomorrow's another day. Sorry to rush you, but I hate parking tickets. No, that’s alright. My secretary had noted the time, and you are very prompt. It comes naturally to us Swiss. He will never know the end of this story She never looked to understand life One day will have traced the path of history And will guide the steps of lovers of the night Will Romeo and Juliet dream Will Colombine look for Pierrot Big love, dreams, love affairs They will be there, Juliet and Romeo Into the night, long night Seven years on the run strange music recalls the past Turn, always turn the scandal machine The waltz of big money The waltz of big notes So where are Antony and Cleopatra? What happens to Colombine and Pierrot? Sweet love Time is not palaver Where have Juliette and Romeo gone? Adventure dances like a guinguette The coffee flows by the water's edge In the arms of Jules or Juliette When all the Toms become Romeos Can I ask you a question? Do you read the newspapers? For 2 days, you're the first customer... not to talk to me like I was a tart or a showgirl. Why? That's four questions. Because you are what you are, and that seems enough to me. For? That's five. For my happiness. My contentment... of this minute, this outing... ...of this morning. You don't actually need a house. Everyone needs a house. Women, children, calves, cows, pigs, hens... Good. I was the mistress of a gangster. I'm now the mistress of a property developer. The first has been lurking around me for 2 days... ...to kill the other, who's now packing boxes. And me, I let myself be fooled by a dirty little journalist... ...smarter than the others. Go for it! Take notes. Yes, Mr Fernier should marry me. Yes, Mr Fernier bought me a real estate agency. He maintains me, and I ruin him. Mr Fernier disappoints me. Yes, I'm a former Bluebird. And hold on! This is unprecedented... I'm going back to the Bluebirds as soon as possible. There, at least, I had girlfriends... ...a job that I liked with people I liked. Yes, you can watch me! I'm not over the hill yet, you know! Bravo for your light burgundy. I give you my word... I've never written a single line for a newspaper. Do you believe me? Yes. I carried on like an idiot... ...but it relieved me. Someone unknown, who looks nice... A song? That's nice. You know, when you're in trouble... someone nice is sometimes very useful... Someone who brings you some tranquility. If there's one thing that I want... ...it's tranquility. Catherine, what I told you is very serious... ...and very important. Not just for you, but... ...for both of us. So if things don't turn out as you wish... I know. Thank you for everything. Hello Hello! Hello! Who is speaking? Please speak. I've heard that before... the rooster. Do you think I can find a shack in... Wait! Hello? Hello? What is this? Hello. Roland Fernier speaking. Hello? Who is that? It's you, eh? If that's you, say so, damn it... It's already better. There are hundreds of roosters in the suburbs... ...but not hundreds of roosts so close to the train tracks... ...where two trains meet between 3.30 and 3.45pm. ...and one of which is slowing down to enter the station. There, I believe it's getting good. For you, Tunel, it's very good. You work on it. Jacquet can take care of it. I'd like to check the Sana. You annoy me with your Granier. You'll not go to Vence. That Laigneau is hiding in the suburbs, seems definite to me. Let's think. Collectives, council estates, we'll cross check. We ignore the villas. Until the Galleries, we know where he lodged. We got him 10 days later, ...so his hideout is between the two. You, suburban agencies with Magnier... Check on any deals made between April 28 and May 12, 69. You, the telephone company with Lamotte... Suspended subscribers for non-payment from the end of May '69. Billard, the same for electricity. - It'll take long. They've got computers! Right now you impress me as much as a bunch of asparagus! Because here... ...we are saved! Well, you see, I've been thinking. But... how did you do it? I opened an account. It won't please everyone, but anyway... ...we're still not showing a hole in the accounts. And we don't have to shout it. But there is someone that you must notify immediately... Your go-between. Hello. It's Catherine. We have the money. What do we have to do? No. Fernier doesn't know anything about you. I said, he doesn't know anything. Neither him nor the police. So what do we do? Who? Himself? Tonight? All right. It will be possible. He has to leave the door ajar. Yes. And no light. You quite understand? Goodnight, Catherine. - You have to take the money now. - Where to? To my house. He'll pick it up between 3 and 4am. So we have to deliver as well? He doesn't care about us, does he, your go-between. - No way! - Look, let's do what he asks. We go to my house and we leave. And it will be over. Finished! Piece of shit! Well, I'll go there... But you stay here. 1,000 grand! There'll be a great song and dance... Well, all the same, it's happening. That would be really too stupid! But... What are you doing here? I've seen you before. You're a TV journalist? Or rather, no. That's it! The guy with the ray. Damn! Damn! Damn! To put me in such a mess! - As for you, oh dear! - We couldn't know about her. I don't care about the girl. It was a trap! Blame! And you'll explain yourself to the chief. We're going to have to play tight, Toto! Good. Well, it's worth thinking about. Ah, Anne-Marie! Dr Laval thinks I should take a cure. Put that in my medical file, and then you can leave. I will call you in 2 or 3 days. Mr Bidaut is there. He's waiting for you. He is really crazy! You couldn't prevent him from doing this... well, this... It's going too far... with that on your hands! - I hope it's the last one. - Yes. I hope so, for your sake. Rest assured, in this respect, I have what it takes. Well, so much the better! I'm totally fed up with this bloodshed! There you are. Well... Are you kidding? Friendship is back on track. With this testimony of my loyalty... ...I think Marcel will welcome me with open arms. But beware! It was not planned like that. I warn you... if both of us come, he shoots us. Straight ahead. You have to go out to Nemours. But it's not this exit! Laigneau phoned me. The appointment is changed. I have no intention of giving 100 million to Laigneau. Do you understand that? Have you ever had so much money? And if you had it, you'd let it go, so easily? Well, you see! So I will explain to you what happened. I gave you the money. You double-crossed Laigneau. You ran away with his money and you vanished. Where I'm taking you, believe me... No one will ever find your body, trust me. Hey... The Galleries guard was found, because I wanted it to be. It was on Laigneau's head. Why did Fernier go to your house? He knew you weren't there, he'd just left you. Well... He'd made an agreement with Laigneau. He brought him the money. That was clever! And he went alone, like that? Yes... He didn't want me to go with him. If he wanted to go alone, it's probable... ...that his intentions were not completely pure. Neither was the money, according to Safimmo's accounts. He was armed. He knew Laigneau wanted to kill him. I'm sure of it. Alas, it wasn't Laigneau killed. - In any case, not by Fernier. - It's despicable! There was nothing else to expect from Laigneau. If you want some advice, my pet... ...disappear for a few days into the countryside, ...until we get our hands on him. It won't be long... I'll get there. They're mine, you know. I paid for them. With what money? This is Mrs Roland Fernier. The truth. I suspected it. It's for her. She hasn't been long in finding another. It's you? I saw the newspapers. It's been happening around you, since our... So, if you still want that tranquility... I can help you. Of course. Good. Hardly. All right. Stay here! - Boss, the ballistics are definite. - So? The same weapon killed both. Laigneau, Veron... The Galleries. He probably didn't pay his share. Laigneau executed him, like Fernier. For the period and the sector that interest us... ...1,012 subscribers had gas and electricity cut off... ...for default of payment. Among these 1,012, 393 individual houses. Good. Then? Of these 393 houses, only 108 also have the water cut off. Good. Then? Of these 108, only 5 were subject to a sale in those dates. Yes. You like suspense. Five! Here are the names... Laurent, Pessonnet, Chevois, Revazzi and Lefol. "Le fol" "the mad"... That's Laigneau's nickname. He may have made fun of us, but this time, we've got him. We hit it tomorrow morning, at daybreak. Laigneau! No bullshit, you're done! Come out with your hands in the air. So? Search... but disturb as little as possible. The bird can return to the roost. - So you got him? - No. - Where's the boss? - Over there. This is where I'll get him, the piece of shit! He has to turn up here some day. We won't see him again. We'll have to make do with the other. - The other? - My mark. Granier. He was never seen again at Sana de Vence. What the fuck can it be? A shmuck is a shmuck. A sanatorium is a sanatorium. Vence, Savoie or Finistere... I do not want to hear you talk about it anymore! If we don't care... Why not Switzerland? Good morning, Sir. Do you have anything to be declared? Her. - Not too much currency? - Just what she needs. - Very in love! - With her. - Thanks. - Goodbye, sir. Gosh, I feel so good! I didn't know that a man like you existed. I knew that a woman like you existed. That's the main thing. Good, fun, sound, rich. And honest! What more do you want? We're not about to change. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
