Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom, wake up. Come on, wake up. Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Talk to me! Mom! Mom! Mom! I see your mother wanted to be cremated. They'll arrange for her cremation once the cause of death has been determined. You will be notified to collect her remains. Now, I have to ask you some questions. It's standard procedure. You're fifteen, right? Socrates, honey. I need you to answer me. Are you fifteen? I'm told you and your Mom moved here three months ago. Where did you come from? What about your father? Can we get in touch with your father? Honey. Are you in touch with your father? Well... I'll be honest with you. The landlady says you owe rent. If we can't find you a guardian, you'll be placed in a home. No one likes hospitals. But your Mom needs to be taken care of. She's been sick for way too long. It's not serious. She's getting better. She'll be in tomorrow. - Has she been drinking tea? - Yes. My sister was also in a lot of pain. She went to the spirit doctor for help. She said it really helped. If you need anything, I'm here for you. I thought your Mom was coming in. She'll be in tomorrow. She's getting better. He's taking her to see a spirit doctor. Will you close everything down? - Yes, Mr. Cleinaldo. - Thanks. You can't keep filling in for your Mom. She's getting better. She'll be in tomorrow. If she wants her paycheck, she'll have to come in, right? I need the money today. I'll square things off with her tomorrow. I have to pay the rent. Tomorrow... - Give me her money. - Listen! I've been very lenient letting you fill in for her. -So I'm working for free? -You shouldn't even be here! Show some respect, boy! That's just not okay. If he hits you, tell me and I'll go talk to him. You can't do that, because he's younger than you. You're the one provoking him. Do you agree? If I hear you've been rude, then I won't take you. I'm paying close attention to your reports. If I get back from work and they tell me you behaved, I'll make a note of it. I'll remember. Turn that down, Socrates! Richelly! Yes? I'll get you the rent soon. Ma'am, I need to print this. How many copies? I'll print one and make 20 copies. How much would that be? Twenty... It'll be... a dollar fifty. Can I give you 50 cents now and the rest later? We don't work that way here. Come on, I would be paying in installments. Installments? Very funny. Come on, ma'am. I'm trying to get a job. Wait, are you hiring? Hiring? You don't even know how to handle a computer. If you teach me, I'll learn. Fine. Give me 50 cents. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, sweetie. - Are you looking for help? - Not right now. - I'll do anything. - We're not hiring. Thank you. Hiring? - For work? - No. Thank you. What's up? Murilo! Stay off the street. Thank you. Take him inside, auntie. Let's wash those hands, sweetie. How is everything? Fine. Nobody expected this. She seemed fine. It was so sudden. - What's up, Socrates? - What's up? - How are you? - I'm fine, you? - I'm great, man. - Any news? I found someone to replace Josue. I told you I'd do it. I figured you wouldn't be up for it anymore. I am! When is it? It's tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. - I'll do it. - Can I trust you? - You bet. - You know where it's at? Jabuca? Jabuca? You got it. I'll let them know you're coming. Awesome, thanks. Who are you? I'm filling in for Josue. I can tell you're fast. What are you looking at? Is there something on my face? Are you fucking with me, you son of a bitch? - Don't look at me, faggot! - Suck my dick! Stop! Stop this shit, man! - What the fuck's going on? Enough! - You son of a bitch! Get the fuck off me. Enough! Enough! I want you both here. I'll get rid of you both. Is that what you want? - Is that what you want? - No, sir. - How about you? - No, sir. Get back to work. Maybe I should start praying. Before that, he wasn't shit. - He was nothing. - You think? Yeah, but he was born to do this. Sure, sure. Whatever. I don't know. They just want to party. You'd be the same if you had that kind of money. No, I wouldn't. - Do you need me tomorrow? - No, thanks. Call me if something comes up. Sure. They want to slash our budget? So we'll mop with our spit when we run out of cleaning products. You can tell them I said that. Come in. Was there a funeral? What do you need? Do you need anything? My mom's job. I know how to do her job. I'm fast, I'm responsible. I've already made an exception by letting you fill in for her. But you're underage. I can't put you on our payroll. Teresa can't handle the workload. I'm sorry, but I really can't help you. Take your Mom's money. Take it. Don't you want my number? I can come in if someone is absent. We're not hiring right now. I can leave you my resum in case something comes up. If you have a resum, you can leave it here. Here you go. Feel free to call anytime. Hey. Try the construction store on the corner, on Ipiranga. - Here? - Yes, they're hiring. OK, thanks. I'll check it out. What should I put down? Cleaning crew. Do you have experience?

Do you want anything to drink? - Just a glass of water. - Come on, be a man. Hold this. You call me over for work and offer me liquor? So, the job fell through. They just called me. And I didn't have time to let you know. But relax. Have a drink. I went a little crazy the other day. It was fucked up. I'm sorry. You didn't call me over for work, did you? Hey, neighbor! Did you see the water man come by? - Shut up! - Don't talk to me like that! I haven't seen him! Dumb neighbor. Are you from around here? Sort of. What about you? I'm from the West Side.
