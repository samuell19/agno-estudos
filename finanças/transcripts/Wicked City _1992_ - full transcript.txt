It has a dazzling body Held up by steel and cement This is our Wicked City We humans are parasites to it We have to fight each other every day And we have to fight the Wickedness I've never seen you in this red light district before. There's been a perverted psychopath around here... who's killed a lot of you girls in this area. Aren't you afraid? In my line of work, I try to pick my clients. I rarely run into a gentleman like you. What's your name? Just call me Perrier... I can quench your thirst. You still haven't told me how much money you get. 30,000 Yen... and I won't complain if you give me a tip. I'll go take a shower first. I still have to catch the late flight to Hong Kong. If you want a quicky, you don't have to explain. I'll make you feel so good tonight you'll die. Careful! I'll kill you with erotic pleasure. Well, I'm waiting for you to come and kill me then. Come on, I can't wait. Aren't you going to shower? Why are you still dressed? I forget...I'm not in the habit of showering first. It looks to me like you're thirsty. Perrier, the more I drink, the thirstier I'll get. And the thirstier you get, the more you'll wanna drink. I really pity you. What's so funny? I'm laughing because you fell into my trap! And you fell into mine! How did you know I wasn't human? The real Perrier died two days ago in the bact alley. You're not Perrier! You're the kind of man who isn't interested in sex. If you don't like it, how can you have any posterity? The only thing that would keep me for having posterity, would be having interest in women like you! Come on! I want you! Here you go! Weren't you going to make me feel good to death? Come out! Here I come again! Honey! Give it to me. I want you! You're out of bullets. Let me do it! Ken, I thought you were going to meet me in Hong Kong. Fortunately I came to Tokyo. OUR WICKED CITY My name is Taki... and this guy who came to meet me in Tokyo is Ken. We're both agents for the antirapter bureau. It's different from other divisions of law enforcement. All agents use an ordinary identity as a cover up. My identity is a salesman of household appliances. Ken is the Fook Kwong company's business representative! We're going to the Fook Kwong Co. to check some goods. When the Hong Kong branch transferred me back here... they said it was for some kind of mission. I felt some strange vibes. Just off the plane? The manager's waiting for you two. Sergent! It's been 3 years. Do you still smoke cigars? You still remember? You don't have that habit! See if the sample of goods is ready! Yes, boss! How come the rapters in Tokyo knew of my whereabouts? The Hong Kong branch's administration's been too careless. There's been administration problems due to 1997. The bureau's sending lots of good men to England. My pressures as manager are great. That's why I had you transferred back here. Do you like watching "Rocky"? I'm only interested in women. Women! You can always look at women. Changing your taste can be very exciting. Open it up. Yes! Why is it so hot? It's maintained this temperature for 2 days. It's still smoking? Which microwave oven is the barbecue smell coming from? So he's the boxer. We found these drugs in his locker. This has been evaporating from inside his body. According to a lead from Thailand... it has something to do with the rapters. It's a pretty drug. This drug's called "Happiness". It makes one's physical strength continuously increase. If they stop talking it... then they end up like this boxer. They evaporate. You've done all you need to. Take the sample back out. Sergeant, I've been following this case all along! The company has made arrangements! Yes sir! Take a look at this colorfully lit up metropolis. It's always been used by many as a place of transit. In 1997, Hong Kong will be given back to China. That will be the easiest time for the rapters to invade. Take a look at this file. This man's name is Daishu. Says he's the president of Asia Finance. Surprisingly he has $500 billion in liquid assets. Money is mankinds biggest weakness. We checked into his past. He's at least...150 years old. We're positive he's a rapter. Tomorrow, Daishu will celebrate his birthday. We'll use this chance to expose his enterprise. I need a partner. Can you give me Ken? No! He has a bad background. The company's secrets have been leaking out lately. I think someone here has been selling them. So you must work alone. There's no way you can use Ken. What if I insisted? You can't insist on something when you have no choice. One more - Me too - OK Let's call it a day. The company has a new product. The manager said I could give you a sample. This mobile phone has a special frequency channel. If these are sold in the market in large quantity... it will help us gather intelligence on the rapters. Congratulations! You outsold the record on these. It seems all I can sell is new products. I should be congratulating you, Orchid. I hear you're being promoted to assistant manager. I'll never get that opportunity. Ken! It's for me. Hello...that's right, I gave the new product to Ken. I'm going now. Ken, the manager seems prejudiced against you. But I've always admired you. Thanks! Everyone tells me that when they get promoted. I just... I know, you want to say time will prove I'm good. Is that what everyone else said too? Yes, and time's proven the opposite This is a practical world we live in. I feel something! There's a rapter here! Ken. A liquid rapter? There's more than just one! My darling. Ken! This girl is 7 feet tall. She's that tall? I said 7:00. Why're you here at 9:007? You almost missed a beautiful opportunity! Don't worry! This is just ordinary fluid. Are you hurt? The police are coming. It's time for us to leave. Ken, you have black blood. Others will see that you're not human. You're the only friend I have. The sergeant said my background's bad. It's because I'm not 100% human. Time will let you prove yourself. It isn't my fault. I just want to be a normal human being. My mother's a rapter. It was my parent's doing! This isn't my fault! I'm innocent! Ken, calm down! - Calm down! - Yes! Calm! I should be calm. You know I really worry about you. I'm afraid you will... turn into a rapter! Even you suspect me? Why did I even stick around? My secret will get out sooner or later! Ken! I have a secret too. I met a rapter once. It was pouring down rain that night. I was sent to catch a rapter. But I never would have guessed... I'd back down on my assignment! I know you're a rapter! I've been ordered to arrest you. You're lucky to have found me. But unfortunately... You have to kill me! My badge! I can't arrest you! Get out of here! Get away! Your badge. Is your name Taki? Who'd believe a rapter would help an agent. What are you doing? I won't hurt you. Are you here to save me? Is that funny? Even though I'm a rapter... the rapters still want to hunt me down and kill me. I'm tired of us slaughtering each other. In the rapter world, I heard humans were good natured. Give me a chance! That chance turned us into close friends. She helped me solve cases as my informant. Our feelings for each other kept growing. That's why I had to leave her. You were afraid the bureau would find out? I was afraid I'd fall for a rapter like your dad did. Are you willing to be my partner? The sergeant wouldn't like it. He won't know. He's stubborn. He can't be stubborn about things he doesn't know! The musicians have arrived. - We're the band. - This way. A musician with no instrument? I play the piano. - Go on up! - Thank you. Happy birthday, Daishu. No pictures! Get those reporters out of here. Get out of here! Happy birthday to you, Daishu. Daishu, go to the 12th floor conference room. They're all waiting for you there. There are undercover agents in 3 of my companies. The reason I know is because they've found this. This drug is from the rapter world. How did it get here? I'd like to know the reason myself. I'm afraid our enterprise will be exposed. I think the antirapter bureau is watching us. We should cancel the birthday party. You're the most flirtatious PR woman I've seen. Honey. We've lived with the humans for a long time. Our influence has penetrated their economic system. Man's weakness is in his economy. Even if our identity's disclosed... they'll have to think carefully. If they lose the support of my enterprise... their economy will fall apart. Therefore, we'll be able to negotiate with them. I stress that we must get along peacefully with humans. Who fired the gun?! Shudo, that's enough! Don't carry on any further. I haven't tasted human blood for a long time. Let alone the fresh blood of a female. It gets me easily aroused. I want to see how excited... your blood can make me! Get changed, your father's waiting for you. Daishu?! He's old. Everything he owns... will soon belong to me. Not you too! I want to eat you whole. I am afraid you couldn't swallow. I have thorns. I'm willing to try! You get me so excited. I'm getting aroused just thinking about it. The pleasure of not being able to swallow something. No...No! Come out! I didn't fire the gun. You needn't let me see you. Get away! Windy?! Taki?! Who did you come to get this time? I came for Daishu. Your identity's been exposed. Get out of here! 3 years ago, you ran out on our relationship. You keep hiding and hide to a place so I couldn't find you. You shouldn't have come back. I belong to Daishu now, the man you came to get. He didn't leave me when I needed him most. All peoples paths must part one day. So you ran away. I can't let you come here to harm Daishu. Whatever you do to him, you do to me. Fine! Then I'll take care of you first. Go ahead! I'm waiting for you to shoot me. Rapter Vacuum?! You wouldn't have done that 3 years ago. No electricity?! Are those your men rushing in? No! They don't look like agents to me! They're very powerful! They aren't like you agents! Maybe they're rapters coming after Daishu. Taki! Who's there? It's myself?! It's rapter vacuum. Eat this! Don't kill him. Let him go. What for?! If he arrested me... would he let me go?! Besides, he's seen our faces. I won't be satisfied if I don't kill him. You're the killer of the rapter world. I'm a businessman in their world. I won't kill anymore. Why did you come back here? I want to take over your company... and enlarge our circle of power in the human world. You're dreaming. Do you think one man is going to be able to stop us? I have men working with me of course. My assassin is the drinks you just had! Get out here now! Liquid rapters?! Daishu, your enterprise has fallen apart. I'm going to destroy everything you own. Take a look at your Windy. Let her go. I'm going to inject her with "happiness"... and watch her slowly evaporate! Windy. Stop! "Happiness"! You put "Happiness" to here Who instructed? Speak up! Windy... Windy. Don't worry, she'll be alright. She's a rapter?! That's right. Watch out. Here comes the liquid rapter again! If it covers the entire car with itself, we're finished. Who taught you to drive? Taki, I'm hot. You know her?! Yes. She's the rapter you let go?! Yes! Taki, the drug is taking effect. Kill me. There must be a way to save you. I hope this will remind you of me. Taki, are you serious about her?! Shit! The sergeant. Ignore him. Don't stop! Drive across! Taki, I didn't want to make things difficult for you. I'm sorry! Taki, where are you going? Why didn't you stop when you saw my car? Ken Kai, what are you doing here? Orchid, take him back to make a report. Yes sir! Continue catching rapters! Yes sir. Sergeant... You've been hurt?! There's been a new development. They're having an internal struggle. That's their nature. The greater their disorder, the more we benefit. Go after them! Sergeant, we did as you instructed. South Hong Kong's electricity suddenly increased 800%. Dying rapters are using electricity for resurrenctions. They must be hiding in the Southern electricity plant. Arrange for a search of the plant! Yes sir! Energy! We can use the rapter's method of resurrection. I'm old! The method takes a very long time for me at this age. I think I need to give my business over to my son Shudo. Daishu... It doesn't matter where you hide. Antirapter agents will never stop hunting you down. The rapters fought the humans due to a lack of energy. But the vast energy used for the war made things worse. The only solution was to get along peacefully. Windy, I know you have feelings for that young agent. You're my only hope for successful dialogue with humans. I've tried learning man's emotion of love. It's a pity I've failed. They always run from love because they're afraid of it. They'll change. Since this planet's days are numbered... our common enemy is time. We must fight against time! You've been poisoned with "happiness"! We must switch all the blood in her body to save her. Otherwise you'll evaporate away. No! If we do that then you'll evaporate. It doesn't hurt to sacrifice oneself. I learned that from humans. Daishu, I'm sergeant Kayama. I hope you'll cooperate with us. We don't want to have to use force against you. Go down there. We believe in our hope for getting along with humans. Get out of here right now. Find the rapter who placed this trap... So no one else will end up with no way out like me. Block all the exits! - Search thoroughly. - Yes sir! The antirapter agents have come here for us. I haven't much time left. Even if I could escape it's useless. Quickly go and look for Shudo. He will think of a way to save me. That's my last and only chance! Daishu. Taki. Windy?! Windy, get out of here. Daishu is over here. Shoot! There's no need to shoot. We'll use a human powered magnetic field! Don't move! He's too weak. He has no energy to resist. Take him to the forensic lab. Yes sir! Daishu, I'll tell you just one more time. If you tell us where the rapters are hiding... we'll let you keep your orginal rapter face. We won't disect you for the sake of research. You don't have to do that. I can tell you...The number of organs is about the same in all animals. I thought violence was the nature of rapters... and that the nature of humans was kindness and peace. Isn't that so? Control him with telekenetics. Strengthen the magnetic field... Yes. We humans are slaves to money. I'm on a pay roll too. How many cubes? That's alright, I can do it myself. When influenced by money, we all become short sighted. Where's the woman? What woman? What woman?! Your lover, that's who! Sergeant, I pity you. I saw it in your eyes. Humans are oppressed by this emotion of love. Isn't killing people with drugs a greater oppression? I have nothing to do with that drug. But think about it. So many of you want to numb yourselves with "happiness". That must mean your lives are miserable! Our lives are miserable... because you rapters messed up our legal system. You have more than one type of law. Besides, your legal system has many weak points. Letting you arrest me was a form of cooperation. Could you have gotten me if I hadn't been willing? Increase the magnetic field by 3 times. Daishu, age is a hindrance. You're already 150 years old. Don't even think about performing another resurrection. All those in my organization are tired of the fighting. So is my Windy. Strengthen the magnetic field. Force this rapter back to its original shape. See if you creatures ever dare do this again! Sergeant. Ken Kai, come with me. Yes sir! Our actions are all leaking out to the rapters. You are the biggest suspect... because of your unclean background. I've decided to temporarily suspend you. Orchid, get his gun. Understand?! Yes sir! You're ungrateful for all I've taught you. - Sergeant. - I won't change my mind once I've made a decision. Orchid. We've got Daishu in our hands. We'll move in and capture them while they're in chaos. Yes. We'll confiscate every ounce of "happiness”. Hit me, honey! Hit me hard! I'm the only one left in the finance company. Shudo, who'd guess that you're the distributor of "happiness”. Daishu has been arrested. You're the heir of Asian Finance's 128 companies. You'll be the most powerful rapter in the human world. I love your body. You can turn into a car... or even an airplane. What I like the most is a video game machine. I'm going to get the highest score on you. I'm going to turn this place into the first rapter city. Who is it? Windy. Windy? The woman with thorns... All of you get out of here! Get out! See if anyone's following us. There is. That's good. You're more exciting than a video game. How dare you come back here, you traitor. I didn't betray you. I've come back to ask for your help. Daishu has been arrested. How were you able to come back? Daishu wants me to tell you... you must find out who's distributing "happiness". Why should I trust you?! What are you going to do to prove yourself? I've been poisoned by "happiness”. How do you want me to prove myself?! Who is it? Room service. You don't work here. "Room service..." - Taki. - Windy. Are you here to ask me to help you save Daishu? No! I've risked coming here for you. I've been poisoned with "happiness”. I'll evaporate soon. I want you to take me back to where we were 3 years ago. Take me back to that day it was raining so hard. Let me be with you. I've no time left. Coming to see me has made your time even shorter. If that's so, then the first shot you fired... should have hit me in the heart. Why let me live, just to miss you the way I have. - Taki. - Windy, you're poisoned. You couldn't go back. You should hurry and leave. Your gun is useless. A hard gun that won't fire... is just trash. You can't run away again. Windy, the reason I left you... is so I wouldn't have to face something like this. That while we were together... you would die in front of me. I'd rather I died in front of you. I don't want to leave you. You put poison on your lips?! Taki... Why did you do that? Everything you just said was a lie?! Taki, I beg of you... If you obey my instructions to go save Daishu... I'll give you an antidote. Go to hell. I'll take you...take you back to the past. Back to 3 years ago in the rain, before I knew you. I'll kill you with one shot. I'll kill you...I'll kill you...I'll... You should be happy! You won! "Room service..." Taki, you're so stupid! Taki. Let me do it. You want to get away?! Don't move! Watch out for this woman. She's cunning! Everything she says is a lie. Taki, I should have known all along... that I couldn't force you to save Daishu like this. Don't fall into a trap. Antidote! Take this and save him. You eat it first. You believe me now?! No. Come with us. You think you can arrest me? You underestimate me?! The antidote is poisoned. I've been tricked. Shudo, you betrayed me?! Ken. What game is this rapter playing? Windy, are you in pain?! You've all fallen into my trap. Taki, look at the ceiling. See how Windy and I look during passionate sex. Don't you feel ashamed for her?! I even feel ashamed for myself! Windy, we've made love once. You're not attracted to me anymore! You and Taki will hate each other just before you die. I want you both to die unhappily. I succeeded! Congratulations, you died with your eyes open! He used Windy to kill me... Taki, I'm taking you to headquarters immediately... Save Windy. What for? If she knew the antidote was fake... she never would have done this. Taki's pulse is returning to normal. Sergeant, we saved your men's lives. Windy. Sergeant. We found two poisons in the female rapter's body. We could only remove one of the poisons. The other poison in her body is "happiness". The only way to remove this poison... is to exchange all her blood with someone elses. Since she's a rapter... Daishu's blood is the only choice we have. Daishu is too important to us. This woman isn't of much use to us. Start up the magnetic field to change her form. I want to get a good look at her rapter face. Damn! How will I be able to sense Windy is here? Sergeant. Ken, your actions give me no choice but to suspect you. Only agents knew which hotel Taki stayed at. Why did rapters go up there? Sergeant, ... I am now officially removing you from your post. If not for me, Taki would've died in the hotel. One must control his emotions when dealing with rapters. I'm very disappointed in Taki too. Your dad ended up with a rapter because of his emotions. I only let you stay so long because of your father. I gave you one last chance to prove yourself. You didn't make good use of it. Ken, the sergeant is cold blooded. I hope we can make him change some day. But if you were in his shoes right now... You would've done the same thing. I... You think time will prove this to be a practical world? Time is set by man. Why do we want it to prove everything to us? Actually, we give our entire lives to time. Men has always decided many things ahead of time. I agree! You know I've been waiting for you all along. You're like the sergeant. You only care about the job. I'm no longer... I have to go. I miss you When I'm not here... just imagine I'm with you. Attention all units! Attention all units! We've an Emergency. Be ready to depart in 3 minutes. Taki? Windy, I don't want to see you turn... Don't ever turn back into a rapter. You're really going to leave me this time? The past is already gone. I'm usually not this emotional. The crystal on this necklace... is like a drop of rain water. You can keep these drops of rain. Just like those from that night 3 years ago... I'm leaving now... Have the goods arrived? Just got here. Get ready to open it. It's all pure "happiness"! With 5 tons we can saturate this city with "happiness”. The money's ready, boss. 30 million US dollors. Count it. You're nice and punctual! Orchid?! Without your help we never could have... brought so much "happiness" into this port. I'd like to get to know you better. I'm not interested. Rapters and humans have fought for thousands of years. I can't begin to guess how long it will go on. I'm not interested in this type of history. "Happiness"? What are you doing?! You still take this drug? I'll just add to your madness. I need it. It replenishes my energy. I can't... Ken, hurry back and tell Taki... Orchid is the spy. I just wanna make the most money in the shortest time. I want out of this foolish war. Our remaining energy won't last long. Let's see which side backs down first. It doesn't matter who backs down. Whoever honourably steps down will be the winner. I've made enough money. I can step down now. Don't forget, you still have one thing left to do. Destroy the antirapter bureau's magnetic field. Let's go find Taki! No! I want to kill Shudo. You go on ahead! Windy! Sell it cheap and spread it all around. Even young kids should have "happiness”. Consider it done. Drive! Do you know where to go? Yes. You had me convinced! You betrayer! Want to escape?! Ken, drive back! You're calling me a betrayer? You betrayed Daishu and I'm going to kill you! I can't stand it. Give me some happiness. Windy! Take it back! Done?! Shudo! Come over here. Windy, come on! I'll slown down anad wait for you. It's useless! Let me do it! Come over Don't stop! Get going! Let's keep playing. You want to surround me? Rapter Vacuum?! Ken! Don't move! This is a specially restricted area. Anyone who goes in must face the consequences himself. This is a restricted area... Anyone who goes in must face the consequences himself. What's going on? We've the license for self defense. Fire anytime. Hands up! Get your hands up now! Sergeant, one of our agents is a spy! You dare to come back! You dare to come back here?! This is stupid! Orchid? Ever since you disboeyed his instructions... the sergeant ordered me to keep an eye on you. We're aware of every single move you make! You won't get away with it. Orchid is the spy! You've no right to speak here! Windy and I saw you take money from Shudo! You let Windy go. You're the spy here! No! Who let Windy go? I don't know! How is it you saw Windy? Tell me! Speak up! Ken. Orchid, you're a bitch! Ken. Let's go. Hurry up! Taki?! After them! Yes. Stop following me. Ken! Where are you? Windy's been abducted by Shudo. What exactly is it you want to do, Ken? I want to find Dishu and take him to save Windy. You're digging your won grave. Ken! Don't move! Ken, aren't you being suspended? Turn on the magnetic field! No! Shit! The magnetic field has been turned off, sergeant. I'll go with you. Go with me? I'm the only one who understands you. I understand you too! Daishu?! Can you sense me? Ken, I can sense you. Daishu. Are you Ken Kai?! I know you're an agent. Just like you, I betrayed my own world. Think differently doesn't mean betrayal. I'm lucky and honoured to cooperate with humans. The two of us should get along very well! I sense that sergeant Kayama has surrounded us outside. My friend Taki is outside too. He can save you somehow. OK! Let's go outside together and meet Windy. Taki. Hold it! You can't run away! Shit! I've never seen such a powerful rapter vacuum. Our magnetic field has been broken. Get everyone together and retreat from the building. We'll rush into the rapter vacuum. Yes sir. Daishu, we're too late. You can see everything has stopped. That son of a bitch Shudo is powerful. He's created a rapter vacuum which has stopped time. History is starting to go backwards now. If it keeps up, civilization will return to its origin! Humans will degrees back into beasts. And they'll be controlled bu rapters. To release that kind of energy... he'd have to be on the tallest building in the city. You lead the way, Daishu! Stop! - This is it? - Yes! The rapter vacuum's entrance is this car park. Save me! Windy! Taki, Daishu, save me! Don't fall for it, she's only a halucination. Don't let it control your mind. Ken. Run over there! Oh no! Time is starting to go backwards! Liquid Rapter?! You two hurry and go save Windy. I'll fix this bastard. OK! Come on! Surround me! Find a way to the roof. The most disgusting time is here again! Ken, time is running out. Catch OK! Perfect timing! Just 15 seconds. I can't hold on. Time can't prove anything. Go to hell! I agree! There's no time now. Ken, go up this way. Time is a real pain. Go! It's back again! I don't even know what time it is now. The 68th floor? There's only 15 floors here! It's another rapter! Honey, you remember the 7 foot woman? Welcome to my body. You will soon become part of me. Welcome both of you. Are you both here?! Now die! Ken, let's change elevators! No need for that you'll soon be part of this elevator. I can't imagine what we'll look like as an elevator! Bullet! Keep shooting! It's exciting! This is ridiculous! She must be kidding us. I know how to handle these kind of women! You old bag! Hurry up! Keep looking for a way up! Open it! You wanna get away?! The show begins! You're too old. You're no match for me. What are you doing in there? You're a machine. I'm redesigning you. I want to make a game that's more fun to play! How are you redesigning me? Here's a rapter climax. You'll become whatever I want you to become. You're machinery. You can't know the pleasure of sex. I don't have to. All I have to do is pretend! Daishu, get down here quick! You're pitiful! You're just the same as a machine. I'm gonna ride you till you're exhausted. You can't get away! Nice reaction! The rapters are collecting energy up there. Help me! Help me! - Shudo. - Don't do anything rash. Taki?! Taki! Come and help me! Windy. It'll be more exciting if you both come over. Save me! Shudo! I'm going to kill you! Come here! Taki, it's an illusion. Don't fall for it. Windy! Taki... It's Taki! Raise him up with telekenetic power. Taki! Ken! You can't escape! Shudo, come out and fight me! I'm here. Forget about me, I'm dying anyway! Ken! That's right! Endure it! Endure it! Careful! He's stimulating you to become a rapter. I won't change! I won't change! You were a rapter from the beginning. Ken, don't believe him! I'm not a rapter. I'm not a rapter. Ken, you've changed! Strengthen the magnetic field. Yes sir! You've the great blood of a rapter in you. The humans despise you. Now go and kill them all. Double the energy. Windy. Taki... I save you Rapters are coming down! Are you Ken Kai? Ken! Don't shoot, he's one of us! Ken! Ken! Keep calm! You can regain your humanity. You've learned how to control yourself! Ken, come back! Don't make any more mistakes! - You're human! - Kayama! You're a hypocrit! Where's your dignity? You've been sacrificing your men for your own power! Including Ken! You looked down on him... and, you made everyone else look down on him. You hadn't the charity to give him even one chance. See, he can't even lift his head in front of you. He can't even stand up straight! Ken, fight back! Kill them all. Hurry! The human magnetic field. Shudo, you've gone too far. Even though you're my son... I'm going to destroy you with my own hands. Father, I'm so happy. You've finally returned to your original form. You're old. Your rapter vacuum I useless against me. Wait and see! Your halucinations don't scare me. Shudo, you really underestimate me. The crazier you get, the more it breaks my heart. And the more I don't want you to die by human hands. This violent battle is just between the two of us. Let everyone else go. Windy. Are you alright? Taki. Dad has come to kill you! Rapter vacuums are a tough obstacle for humans. Your greatest obstacle is yourself. You old bitch, why are you hiding in there?! Come out here you bastard! Come out now! Fine! See how long you can carry on like this! Daishul! You bitch. Do you feel like your body's missing a lot of parts? You're going to die soon. I've absorbed a lot of your energy. Very soon, everything you have will become part of me. I will be everything! I'm a rapter. Please hate me. I'm happiest when others hate me. - Daishu. - Taki, don't go. You're old. You little bastard! Where are you hiding now old man? Come out here! I'm going to find you! Ken?! Keep clam. Don't let your rapter feelings control your humanity. Ken! Don't you recognise me?! It's me! Taki. Ken. You finally come back. Taki. Windy. I'm finally with you two again. Thank you both. Ken... I'll take you back to the bureau. Ken... They...they don't need me. Ken... Come out! None of you people even know what you are. I have to Kill. Shudo. You're the one who did that to Ken. Come here, come here. I'm not afraid of you. Windy...I don't have to prove anything anymore. If you don't restore yourself... you'll become just like me. I don't want you to turn back into a rapter. Ken, you can't give me your blood. You still have many duties to accomplish. Go and save Taki! Hurry and go save Taki! You old bitch, it must be you who's blocking my way! Why do you keep opposing me? Come out! Where are you? Don't you want to kill me? Stupid kid, I'm in your shadow. I've been right behind you all along. I still have enough power to knock you down. I'll give you one last chance, kid. Come back here! Why do you only hide in other's shadows? You're weak and timid! Shadows reveal the lights direction. If there's a shadow, then there's light. I'll let you see how fierce shadows are! I'll show you no mercy. Shudo. Come on! It's time for you to die! We'll see which one of us dies! You bastard! How could you use him as a hostage? Let him go. You're dreaming! You've the nerve to go against me, bitch?! If you kill me, you can't save Taki. You'll have to choose! Your weakness is having learned human emotion. Let him go. You think I'd let him go?! I'm just going to torture him to death. Go inside Taki. Goodbye! Taki... Shudo, let him go! Daishu, don't tell me what to do. Humans are really something! What a fake. You're acting so mighty before you die. Let me help you! You betrayer! Windy. Taki. Shudo! I'm doing a good thing by making this a rapter's world. Windy. Only now do I dare look at you in this way. I want to go on like this forever. Windy. Daishu?! Get inside my shadow. Concentrate your telekenetic power. Use it to control the planes safe landing. Sergeant, the airport is too far away. We can't use telemagneties under such hard conditions. It's no use. Let's land here. Yes sir! Increase the strength three times. The magnetic field's at maximum strength. Ken. Nothing can be changed, Sergeant! I'd die. Because I can't prove myself in this lifetime. You're not a rapter. Ken... Ken... It looks like our plans for peace have failed! You're more able to protect Windy. Take her away. If she had to choose between us... she may not pick me. You can't leave her here. Taki, I know that for the sake of being wise... humans tend to suppress emotions under worldly possessions. You're just like Shudo. You won't admit you live in a world of power. Taki. Daishu. Will rapters and humans ever get along peacefully? The agents will come down here soon. I won't arrest you, but they will. Get out of here! Taki, I'll never show up in this city again. I'll never make you betray your job's duties again. I don't mind! I really don't mind! Taki Ken died because of me Sergeant Maybe you can no longer be one Your're starting to have feelings Windy, promise me, keep with your goal. Don't let me and Taki down. Look! This city is so lonely. I hope they'll never need the rapter's "happiness”.
