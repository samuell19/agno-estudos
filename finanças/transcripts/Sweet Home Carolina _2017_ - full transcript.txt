- You promised you would pay the tuition for Andrea's semester, and I'm getting billed again for the line of credit that you were supposed to have paid off. - Broadhill Agency. Yes, I'll put you right through, one moment. - No, no, no, that's not my problem. - Broadhill Agency Hi, Mr. Broadhill. - Why are you building this, this new house when you can't afford it? - You haven't been able to get through Diane's extension all day? - You have a responsibility to me and the girls to settle these debts. No. - I. You think her phone is off the hook? Well, I could, transfer you to her assistant. - Dan, that's not my problem. - Yes, sir. Right away, sir. - Dan! - Heads are gonna roll on this one. - No, I won't, I am stuck once again dealing with it. - Good afternoon, Mr. Broadhill. - did you really just hang up on me? - Um, no, sir, she's still behind closed doors. - Dan! - But let me see if I can get her. Just a moment. - This can't be happening. - I'm sorry, sir. Um, it's still gonna be a while. I understand. I will, sir. Come on, Diane. - Why am I so stupid? God, give me a sign everything's gonna be okay, please. - Diane? - God? Henry. - Diane, are you all right? - Henry, hi, yeah, I'm good. What's up? - My office in 10 minutes. - Okay, sure. - Yes? - You, you wanted to see me. - Come in and have a seat. - Henry, look, I know what you're gonna say, look, I, I know that I've been a little off my game in recent weeks. Okay, but, I promise you, I promise you it'll get better. It's just, I've just been going through a lot, you know, with my ex-husband, and the kids, and blah blab blah, you know the. - I've givin' the Georgia O'Brien account to Matheson. - I, I'm sorry? To, to Matheson? You're, you're kidding, right? - Georgia, she gave me a call this morning, and she said that you haven't returned a single call since Thursday. - That, that's just, that's, that's yesterday. - Last Thursday. - Okay, Henry, that is my account, okay? I have worked with Georgia for the past five years, and I have worked far too hard for far too long to have it just taken away from me, okay? That's just. - And I appreciate all that you have done for this agency. - Are, are you actually firing me? - Diane. - Come on, that's, you know that that's ludicrous. - I beg your pardon? - You can't do this, okay? Not now. I am good at my job, and you know it. Far, far better than Matheson, okay? He, he couldn't lead Dorothy down the Yellow Brick Road. Look, Henry, it is just a rough patch, it's a rough patch. I will get through this, okay? I always do. - These accounts, they can't wait for you to bounce back. If it were up to me, I'd give you a little more time, but I just can't do that. - I have devoted half of my life to this company, half of my life. Okay, I, I have missed school dances, and, and soccer games, birthdays, holidays, funerals. I practically gave birth do my kids on that conference room floor, and I have worked harder and longer than most of the men in this company, and you know it! And I have one bad month, one bad month! And it's, see ya later, sweetheart? - It's not like that, and you know it. - Really? 'Cause it sure feels like it. - Look, you and I have along history together, so how about you take some time? Get your bearings. - This isn't happening. - Deal with whatever you need to deal with, and then in a few months maybe, - This isn't happening. - Let's talk. It's not the end of the world, Diane. Take a vacation. Spend some time with your girls. Look, it's Mother's Day weekend. I'm sure you'll enjoy that you don't have to worry about deadlines looming over your head, or frantic clients blowing up your phone. Enjoy it, okay? Your daughters, they'll love it. - I know, I know, I know. - Don't worry Mrs. Morris, but this is the third time - I know, bad Mom, bad Mom. I'm sorry, you okay? - This week. Please make sure you get here before 4:30 next time. - Let's go. Missy. In your room, homework. - Ooh, pink envelopes, pretty. - Yeah, it's, it's to mask the ugly waiting inside. Andrea! - What? - Honey, the dishes. - I'll do 'em later. - No, now, please. I see you've still got that thing in your nose. - I'm surprised you noticed. Nevermind. What are you doing home so early? - What, I'm home at a normal time. - For other moms maybe. - Hi, Mom, welcome home. How was your day? Not bad, how was yours? Good, I enrolled in college, I got a part-time job, and you know what I did? I made dinner for you, because you do so much for us. I just wanna do something nice for you. - Whatever, when you're done talking to yourself, can we figure out what's for dinner, please? And the mother-of-the-year streak continues. - Honey, just wanna make sure your therapy sessions are worthwhile. That was a joke. Guess not. Breathe. Done breathing? Good. My turn. - You're not gonna eat? - I ate a late lunch, I'm not very hungry. Um, girls, look, I, I know that this has been a really, really rough time for you guys, for all of us, and, I know that I haven't been around much in the past few months, and I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take some time off, okay? So we can, we can spend some quality time together. Okay, how's that sound? - Who are you, and what have you done with our mother? - You know, what better time to bond than this coming weekend, right? - What are you talking about? We have tickets to go see that music festival with Dad, remember? - No, actually, I don't. But that's, I can't, I can't believe I would say yes. I mean, it's, it's my, my special day on Sunday. - What's Sunday? - Andrea? - I, you actually really forgot what Sunday is, didn't you? It's, Mother's Day, does that ring a bell? - Yeah. - Oops. - Done. - All right, go put your jammies on. - 'Kay. - And do your homework, all right? - Yep. - Only one show tonight. - Two shows. - One show, one book. - Deal. - Perfect, hi-five. Love ya, kiddo. - What's wrong with you? - You mean, besides the fact that my only two daughters forget it was Mother's Day on Sunday? - I told you that Dad bought us tickets to that music festival a month ago. Don't you remember? - But, of course, your dad would make Mother's Day about him and plan an activity on my day. So typical. - Well, I mean, maybe we can try to get back here for dinner or something. I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this. You're never home anyways. - Look, Andrea, sweetheart, I know you don't understand, but I have had the longest week followed by the crappiest day, so if I can just have one night, just one where you're not my sworn enemy, or, or nemesis, that would be great. - Are you kidding me? I just asked you what's wrong. You should try it some time. - Good morning, Los Angeles, this is Charlie Jones with KBAC, wishing you moms out there a Happy Mother's Day. We've got a sunny day ahead, and we hope you beautiful moms have a wonderful day. Our request lines are open, so call in with your requests. - Bye! It's so dark. - Mom, I'm, I'm so sorry. My cellphone died, and there was all this traffic. - I work so hard for you girls. You can't even give me one evening of your time? - Told you she'd be upset. - Go to your room. - Gladly, at least Dad wouldn't... - Andrea, stop it. - Just go. Guys, both of you. - What a Mom. - Happy Mother's Day to me. - Mom, Bianca's here, she wants to talk to you. - Okay, hit me with it. - I received a letter from the law offices of Tuttle & Tuttle in South Carolina. Are you familiar with a Miss Hillary Johnson? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was, she was my great aunt, yeah. - So you know she's passed? - Yeah, yeah, and unfortunately I wasn't able to make the memorial because of work. I couldn't get outta town, so. - Were you two close? - Yeah, we, we used to be. I actually used to spend my summers with her. I think the, I think the last time I saw her was the summer I graduated from college. - So you're familiar with the house? - Yeah, yeah, it was, it was like my home. B, I remember I had the most amazing summer that year. I, I actually, I fell in love with this guy. - Ooh, do tell. - He was amazing. I remember feeling like I, like I never wanted to leave. - Him or the house? - I remember thinking that he was the only guy that I was ever gonna love. Do you remember when you felt like that? - What happened? - Reality. I was starting an entry position at Broadhill and he wanted me to stay, which was sweet, but he wanted me to give it all up, and I just, I couldn't, so, I left and clearly lived happily ever after. Such memories, wow. - Well, it looks like you've inherited something. - Please, please, please, I have no desire for bedazzled shirts and trinkets. - What about a house? - Shut up. - Any desire to inherit one of those? - She, she, she left me her, her house? My God! My God, thank you. This is like, this is amazing, this is like the answer to all of my prayers. I mean, this is. - It comes with a dog. - Her dog? - Mister, he's seven, he comes with the house. - Well, I can't, I mean, you know we can't, we can't have a dog. I mean, Aubrey's terrified of dogs, so that's not gonna work, but I'll just, I'll figure, I'll figure that out, I'll find a way to figure that out. - Diane, slow down. - But the house, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make this work, okay? I mean, this, this is amazing, I mean, this is, this. - There are stipulations. - What, what are you talking about? - Well, you must actually live there for a year. - A year? - Before you can sell it, with the dog. - Come on, that's ridiculous. - Well, you don't have to take it. It says in the letter that if you are unwilling, or unable to accept the house, then it goes to the historical society, but you must find a home for the dog. What's a year? - 12 months. - Just look at it as a year-long contract. You said you liked being there, right? And you need some time away from LA. Who knows? You may just look up that old flame again, Luke. - I'm not moving. - Guys, it's just for a year, that's it, for a year. - You can't make me, I'm 19. - That is very true, honey. I, I can't legally make you do anything. But, honey, where are you gonna live? - I'll stay here. - That, that can't work, 'cause I have to sublease the house. - Why are you doing this? I mean, this is absurd, even for you. - Look, girls, come on. I mean, this is, this is what Aunt Hilly wanted. - I don't know why I can't just stay here alone. - Are you, are you gonna pay the bills? The mortgage, and, and the internet, and the cable? Because I, I certainly can't. - Then I'm gonna go live with Dad. - Do we have to go? - Yeah, honey, yeah, we do. - Can I take my stuffed animals? - Honey, of course, of course you can. - Okay, I'll go with you. - Kiddo. You're the best. It'll go by super fast, okay? I hope. - Hey, Dad, um, okay, so I should be all packed up by 12. What time are you comin' to get me? But I could help. Yeah, okay. I understand. Hey, listen, um, Dad? Can I, can I, talk to you later? Yeah, I love you, too. - Hey, honey, what are you doin'? - Dad said I should go with you. Dad said Marissa and him are too busy with the new house and that I can maybe come in a couple months. - Okay, why don't you bring me what you want to take to South Carolina and just put storage on the rest? I'm, happy you're comin', even if it's just for a little while. Okay, I'm gonna need somebody to help me navigate. - Whatever. - Can I help? I'm really glad you're coming, Andy. - He didn't put up much of a fight, did he? - Of course not. Look, he just, he thinks they're better off with me and, you know, he's right. - You know he's not sending for her. - I know, but, look, I, I don't wanna ruin that illusion for her, you know? I mean, he was, you know he was never there for me, like he's gonna be there for her. I can't expect that. - You're a survivor, and you're gonna get through this. - Yes. - And when all else fails, there is nothing that a massage and a glass of red wine can't fix. - So true, so true. ♪ Wherever the wind blows ♪ That's where I'm gonna go ♪ Wherever it takes me ♪ That's where I wanna be ♪ Got to be, got to be ♪ Got to be, got to believe ♪ Got to see to believe ♪ Got to be, got to be ♪ Got to be, got to believe ♪ Got to see to believe ♪ Out on the open road ♪ To a destiny unknown ♪ The future, it unfolds ♪ The story that I'm told - I can already feel my arteries clogging.

Go ahead, sweetheart. After you, your highness. - People are staring at us. - Honey, smile and be polite. - Relax, you guys, it's just tourists. Stop staring. Welcome, hello, ladies. I said stop staring! Did you bring your appetite? You? Okay, let's get you to a table, get some nice food in you before you waste away, come on. Da, da, I'm Penny. Can I start you all off with something to drink? - Do you have chocolate soy milk? - Now what kind of cow do you suppose that comes from? - It's not from a cow. - I have regular ol' milk from a regular ol' cow. I have chocolate in the back. I could maybe jerry-rig you up somethin', I don't know. - She'll just take some water. Is that fine? - All right. And you, madam? - Do you have any fresh-pressed juices? - I have apple juice, and I have orange juice. - Fresh pressed? - I'm pretty sure they were once upon a time, yes. - We'll just take, two unsweet teas, please. - Organic? Or will Lipton do? - Lipton is fine. - You got it, I'll be right back. Pa! I see you, Melvin.

Like it or not, this is your life for the next 12 months. - Three tops, I'm going to live with Dad, remember? - Right, three months and counting. - Yeah, a water for the little lady. - Thank you. - Two unsweet teas for these fine ladies. Now it's time for the obligatory inquisition. Where y'all from? - Los Angeles. - What? My gosh. No wonder, that's why y'all are so pretty. This one's a supermodel. So what brings you to Marion, besides my Michelin-rated food? - Actually, we are, we're relocating. - Here? - Yeah. - Well if you don't mind my sayin' so, this isn't really a town that people move to. - Yeah, it, um, it actually wasn't really part of my plan. - Our plan. - We, we actually inherited a house. - I see. Well, welcome. - Thank you. - I'll give you another minute with the menus. I'll be right back. Hey, where exactly is your family home? - Um, Palmetto Lane. - Palmetto Lane? - Yeah, my, my Aunt Hilly has this, this beautiful home there. - Well if you don't mind my asking, when was the last time that you visited ol' Miss Hillary's place? - Probably, 20 years ago, or something like that. - 20 years? Okay, good stuff. - What was that all about? - This is what we left LA for? - Looks like the Haunted Mansion. - Are you Diane? - Yeah. - Great, I'm with Tuttle & Tuttle. Here are the keys to your new life. Here's your new responsibility. - It's okay, honey. - He's so cute. Can we keep him? - We have no choice. - What a surprise. - It's okay, honey. - Yuck. - You can say that again.

So how's stuff? - Good, it's, you know, it's goin', it's, it's good. - Did you finally get to see Tara? - When I say that I had no idea. - Well, I'm never one to spoil anyone's fun. Look, if I can help you in any way, I'm happy to. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Actually, you don't happen to know anybody who's hiring in the area, 'cause this paper is no help. - Who's lookin'? - I am. - Are you lookin' for anything in particular? I mean, it is a small town, so pickin's are kinda slim. - No, I'm not, not too picky anyway. - How do you feel about waiting tables? We could always use another hand around here during those busy breakfast and lunch hours. - Really? - Absolutely. - Um, wow, I haven't waited tables since, since high school. I'm sure it's like, I'm sure it's like riding a bike, right? - Just like riding a bike. If that bike were wobbling and had a clown horn, yes. Can you start tomorrow? - Yes, I can, thank you. - Yay, done deal. - I'm Diane. - I know, small towns have big ears. - One, one last thing. - Shoot. - You wouldn't happen to know anybody who would hire a angsty teenager, would ya? - Angsty teenager. Well, I would, but we have Jorge the angsty teenager. - Sweet. - You know what, she should go talk to Luke at the furniture store. - Luke? Hunky, strapping guy, good with his hands, single, you know him? - Yeah, actually, I do. - I knew that too. Small towns. - Good luck, sweetheart. I love you so much. - Doubt it. - You break it, you bought it. - I was just looking. - You were touching. There's a difference. - How would you know? You're staring at your book. I saw that, nose ring. - Hey, Troy, would you get your feet off my counter? You must be Andrea? - How do you know? - Small town. I'm Luke, and this hard-workin' fella is Troy. - This is your shop? - It is indeed. I heard you're lookin' for a job. - More like told I needed one. - I see. Well, it's just been me and him here for a while, but we seem to be doin' okay, but Troy's gonna be gone in a year, so it might be nice to have a third set of hands around here. You ever have a job before? - No. - Not surprising. - Never hired or? - No, just never needed one, I guess. - Well, as you can see, we could use some organizing around here, if you think that's something you could do. - I'd expect you to be on time, and let me know if you're gonna be late. Pay is minimum, but I'll split commission on anything you sell. - Hey, don't I get a say in this? - Yeah, yeah, as soon as you pay some bills around here. Can you start now? - Do I need a uniform or anything? - No, we keep it pretty casual around here. You're fine just the way you are. - Minus the nose ring. - Troy will show you the ropes. Happy to have you, Andrea. Back to work. - Hey, honey, how'd it go? - Fine, how'd it go with you? - Good. So, are we a dual income family now? - Whatever that means. - Yeah, woohoo, first job, congratulations, sweetheart. - Yes, honey, congratulations, love. - And how 'bout those boys, aren't they kinda dreamy? Aren't they kinda dreamy? Luke has had Troy help him in the shop ever since he was young. He's really like a second father to him. - That's sweet. Where's his real dad? - Well, we don't know. Luke knew his mom years before and they dated a little bit. People thought that they might get married, but you know I always thought that they were probably just really good friends. And then one day she just up and left with some guy she met, only came back to drop Troy off with his grandparents. I haven't seen her since. - That's sad. - But you know what? His grandparents have done a great job with him. He graduates from college next year. He's cute and smart. - Ooh. - Mommy, I'm hungry. - Sweetie, why didn't you say something earlier? You remember when we were back by the food? You know what, I'd be happy to go fix you guys something at your place. - That's nice. - I'll meet you back at your place in a bit? - Sounds good. - Good eats, I mean, if I do say so myself. It was really good. - It was very, very good. Thank you so much for cooking. - My pleasure. Okay, they look content. - They do, don't they? - Must be all this, fresh Southern air. - Ooh, careful there. You stay stuff like that, you ain't never gonna leave. I doubt that. - No, we'll see. Well, I should probably go before I turn into a pumpkin. Who am I kidding? You know what I'm gonna do tonight? I'm gonna watch a marathon of good old-fashioned cheesy romance movies. - That sounds perfect. - All right? - Yes. - And then cry myself to sleep. - Thank you so much for everything, really. - You are so welcome. - I'll go grab your stuff. - Okay, but just my bag. You leave those adult beverages for the next time. - You got it. - Well hey there, Mister. How are you doin'? Are you takin' care of the girls? - Why is his name Mister? - Well, 'cause he's a boy, and I think 'cause your old Aunt Hilly did have plans for some other kind of name that never happened, so he's just Mister. - Here ya go. - Thank you. - What are y'all talkin' about? - Y'all? - Y'all. - I did it. - You said that. - I see you're not running away from him anymore. - No, I guess I'm getting used to him. - Now will you believe me that not all dogs bite? - I guess so, but I'm not sleeping with him. - Okay, my love, one step at a time. - Ooh, what are we talkin' about? - She, she got bit by a dog when she was seven, and she's been deathly afraid ever since. This is the closest I've ever seen her to one. - Well, you know what? If anyone can melt anyone's heart, it's Mister. All right, sweetheart, I'll see ya tomorrow. You know what you need to do? You need to go reintroduce yourself to Luke tomorrow, and have him fix that door. Because, my word, people can hear you comin' and goin' in Savannah! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Hello. - Sorry, ma'am, we're closed. - The door, actually, was unlocked, so I just. - Well, I guess we're not quite closed then. How can I help you? - Luke. - That's me. - You probably don't even remember me, but. - DJ Montgomery. - Yeah. Wow, I haven't heard that name in, forever. - Diane Janet's always been a mouthful for me. - Lawrence, it's Diane, DJ Lawrence now. Andrea is, she's my daughter. Thank you, thank you, by the way. - For what? - For, for hiring her. I mean, I know she can be a bit of a, a handful, if you will, but hopefully she's been at least respectful. Okay, that's, that's all I wanted to say was just hi, and, thank you, so. - I'd ask you how you've been, but I imagine you've been a lot of things since the last time I saw you. It's been a while. - Yeah. Yeah, it's, been a while. You look like life has been good. - If you mean since the last time you left town, never to be seen or heard from again, yeah, I'd say good's about right. - Right, well, um, this was a good, good talk. If Andrea ever gives you any problems or anything, you, you come talk to me. - Why didn't you call? - Come on, honestly, after the way that we left things, I didn't think that you would ever want to hear from me again, so. - Well, I'm still here. - Goodnight. - Thanks for driving me home. - Mister. Hey, old boy, hey, Mister. It's been a long time. - He knows you? - Yeah. He and I go way back. Your aunt used to take him pretty much everywhere she went. - Got ya. How was your day, love? - Good talk. - That must be the door. - You can hear it? - Yeah, I can hear it. I think everybody could hear it. Should be an easy fix though. I'll, um, I'll go grab my tools. - Okay, awesome, I'll be inside getting the girls fed. If you need anything, just let me know. - You know, water might be nice. Unless you have some of that. - Strawberry lemonade? As if I forgot, come on now. Hey. - Hey. - How's it goin' out here? You almost done? - I think so. It is a 100-year-old door, so it still makes a little noise, but it's gonna retain some of the personality it's gained along the way. - That's all right. - I could hang you a new one. - But it's gonna cost you more than some lemonade. - It's fine the way it is, thank you. You, you hungry? - Yeah, I'm starving actually. - Yeah? Do you, do you want me to make you a little something? - When did you learn how to cook? - Just so you know, I learned a few things while I was away. - Cooking being one of them. I'll get you a refill. - Wow. That is impressive. - Enjoy. You know you don't have to eat it all in one bite? - I'm sorry, I'm hungry. - No, please, I've never seen somebody so eager to eat one of my meals before. - And this strawberry lemonade is better than I remember it. - Well, I'm hoping that you'll, take that as a payment. - Really not sure I'm worth all this trouble. - Well, there is plenty of work to be done around here, if you feel like you're at all taking advantage of me. - Is that right? - Yes, that's right. There are lists, very, very long lists. It seems like my aunt, didn't get around to doing much around here, so. - I mean, this is good. I'm not sure that it's long-list good, but. What's it like being back here? - How is it being here? It's, it's good. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I missed it. - Yet you somehow stayed away until now. All right, all right, all right, I'll stop. I'll just... - Yeah, just go ahead and shove another piece of food in that big mouth of yours. - DJ. - DJ, DJ, God, that brings back so many memories. - Yeah? Where'd they go? - Who knows, I don't know. Buried, I guess, under cities and kids and jobs and ex-husbands. - What, you got more than one of those? - No, no, just one, just one. What about you, any, ex-wives? Formerly, currently? - Nope, single as they come. - Well, my sources tell me, my very good sources, that you actually almost got married when I left. - Yeah, we were more like friends though. And, yes, I did date other women after you. - How dare you? Where is she now? What's, what's she up to? - Nashville, I think. She met this guy and left town right away, and shortly after she got pregnant and she had these dreams of becoming a country music singer and didn't think it was a good idea to raise a child on the road, so she brought him back and left him with her parents, and, um, it started out to be a while, but it seemed like a while turned into permanent. - Does she ever see him, or no? - She did when he was younger, but then things would just happen, you know, camp and school, and Troy helpin' me out. Then just, you know, he stopped mentioning going to see her after a while. - Do they, do they talk at, at all? - Sometimes. Yeah, um, to tell you the truth, I can't understand why someone wouldn't be stoked to be a parent. - I know, I know. I agree. Andrea came, a little earlier in life than I really wanted, but, you know, I just thought I'd have a little more time before I had the responsibility of having kids, but honestly I wouldn't, I wouldn't change it for anything. Except for maybe when she's being a. - Teenager? - Yes, exactly. - Is the dad in the picture at all? - You know, when it's convenient for him. You know how it goes. - How often does she talk to him? - Maybe once a month. Actually, she, she thinks that he's gonna be sending for her and that she's gonna go back to LA and live with him. - No? - I talked to him a couple days ago. He just is, thinks she'd be better off with me. You know, so, what am I gonna do? - What? Dad doesn't want me? - Honey, I, I didn't say that. - But we had a deal. I don't wanna stay here, I wanna go live with him. - Andrea. - So Dad doesn't want me and you never did? - Honey, I, I never said that. - You know what? Don't talk to me, just leave me alone! - Maybe I should go? - No, stay. - Yeah, I think I should probably go. Um. - No, it's, it's fine, it's fine. - Let me get it. Okay. If I see her on my way home, I'll bring her back. - It's all right. I'll take a drive here in a bit. Give her some time to cool off, and or plot my death. - You know, if you're around tomorrow, I can stop by and get started on that list. You're very sweet. I was just, I was just teasing. Really, I, I can handle it. - I'm sure you probably could, but it's okay to ask for help, too. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Andrea, can I talk to you for a sec? - Am I in trouble? - No. Should you be? No, I'm just kidding, I, I feel terrible about last night when you overheard your mom and I talking, and I just wanna clear something up. Your mom never said that she didn't want you. It's the opposite, in fact, she loves you very much. Now, it's not my thing to pry, but what your mom did say to me is that she always wanted to be a mom, and that she would be there for you no matter what. She's doing the best she can in a really difficult situation. And so are you. So, the way I see it is you're kind of in this together, so you may just wanna ease up on her a little bit. Give her the benefit of the doubt. You only get one mom, and the one you got is a strong and amazing woman. Guess that's where you get it from. - This is great. Hey, Luke, you got a real good sale girl here. - Yeah, she's awesome, isn't she? - She's good, thank you so much. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Let me help you. Where are we movin' this? - Right over there. - All right. Wow, it is not light. - Nope. - How's that? - Yeah. - It's looking really good in here. - You don't mind? - Not at all, it looks like you got a knack for it, so by all means, but if you're gonna move anything heavy, let me now. That is really heavy. - Yeah. - Look at him. Troy! Your feet, get 'em off my counter, thank you. - Need any help? - From you? - I'm standing here, aren't I? - All right, can you bring that chair over here for me? And just a little bit further back. - Here? - Okay, actually, a little to the left. - Come on, I feel like I'm dancing with this thing. - Okay, here. - Okay? - Yeah. See, that wasn't so difficult, was it? I really love this chair. - It's handmade. - It's, it's great, I can't believe it's still here. - Well, no one seemed to want to buy it, so all those hours of hard work were just a waste. - What do you mean? - I made this. - Still like it. I sold it. - What are you talking about? - I sold your chair. I found a buyer who loved it and wanted it delivered right away. - You're kidding. Wow, I, I sold my first piece. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, I need to borrow Troy for a minute. We're gonna stop by your mom's, Andrea, and drop off that bench. - Okay, sure. Wait, wait, wait a minute. That's my chair. - Yeah. Andrea bought it and had me deliver it today. She made me promise not to tell you. She's got a good heart. Give her a chance. Come on, push it. - Yeah, okay. - I'm gonna head to the bank for a sec. I'll be, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Okay. - You kids got this, right? - It looks, really good. You're actually pretty good at decorating. - Thank you. - Hey, Andrea, Mom wants to know if you're ready to go. - Well, actually Luke just left. I should probably wait until he comes back to make sure it's okay I leave. - You can go, or you can wait, if you want. We can give you a ride. - You don't mind? - No. - Okay, um, Aubrey, will you tell Mom I'll see you in a little bit? - Okay, bye. - Hey, Andrea, I just saw your sister and your mom leave. - I said that we'd give her a ride home. - You did? Well, we're goin' there anyway. - We were? - Yeah, your workday's not over yet, son. Why don't you grab your bag from the back, lock it up, and we'll head out. Hey, Penny, what a nice surprise. - Hey. - Let me give you a hand with that. - Handsome and helpful. You stop tryin' to woo me, Casanova. Poor Jorge'll feel all threatened. Hey, kids! Hey, Miss Penny! - Anything I can help with? - Nah, I'm gonna go inside and try a new pie recipe. - Everything okay? - You got it. Yeah, it's great. - Yeah, you, ready for me to crack that whip on that list? You think you can handle me? It, the list, the list. - I think so, yeah, to both. - You don't know anything? That's sad. - I know. - What kind of upbringing do you have if you? - You did, I heard you. - Did the bamboo garden survive? - Yeah, it did, it did, and it looks, it looks amazing. - Really? - Yeah, it does, do you wanna see it? - Yeah, love to. - Come on. - Remember how much time we spent out here that last summer? - Yeah. Of course, how could I forget? I mean, look at this place, it's magical. It's like being in a, in another world, you know? - I guess that's why we came out here almost every single night. - Probably. I, I never did forget about you. I thought about you from time to time, but where does that get anybody, except knee deep in regret, so. - Come on, I mean, in hindsight we were still young and had no idea what the world was gonna throw at us. Guess I shouldn't have gotten so serious on ya so fast. I mean, who really knows what they want right outta college? - I thought I did, but it was, it was rough. I, I kinda, I kinda missed you a lot, and I, and I cried a lot, and I drank numerous bottles of wine, if that makes you feel any better. - Yeah, a little bit. - Good, glad I can help the cause. - I knew you were big city, and I was too small town for you. It took a while, I mean, maybe it took a long while, but I knew you wouldn't be happy until you made something of yourself out there. Looks like you did a good job. - I, I don't know about all that. - I do. I'm proud of you. I figured I'd never see you again, and then really nice surprise to see and your daughters go walkin' by my shop that day. I would recognize you anywhere. Still got them same brown eyes that kinda flicker yellow in the light. That smile, your hair's a little different, but I'd know you anywhere, DJ. - Hey, Mom, there you are! Didn't we get some ice cream? We can't find it. - I have to go. ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ Hold on ♪ Something big is coming ♪ Like a lightning bolt ♪ A lightning bolt ♪ In this bright light - Gotcha. ♪ Illuminates the way ♪ To a brand-new place ♪ A brand-new day ♪ I don't know what to expect ♪ But we'll never be the same ♪ Let me know whatever you're feelin' ♪ You and I, pretty soon we'll be sailin' ♪ Through a colorful world ♪ Through a colorful world ♪ Here we go ♪ And it's just the beginning ♪ Yeah, you and me we're spinning ♪ Through a colorful world - Ooh, that looks great. ♪ Hold on ♪ Wild winds are blowin' ♪ And it's changing me ♪ I like what I see ♪ Flying ♪ Proving nothing is impossible ♪ 'Cause this is our time - Wha? - Brr, it's cold out there. - Yes. - I used to live in the South, but I don't remember days as cold as this. - Wow, Henry. To say that this is a surprise is, is a, is an understatement for sure. - Well, I just, I've never pictured you as a country girl. - Right? And, look at me now, Henry. - My, this certainly is quite the change from your office in Los Angeles. - Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Diane, I'm just gonna cut right to the chase. I miss ya, I want ya back. I, I need ya back. Gosh, that didn't sound near as needy in my head. But, um, anyway, there it is. What I meant to say is, will you please come back and, and handle my account? It's just, it's not the same without you. Henry, no offense, but a man just doesn't get my point of view. And, Diane, you and I were so in sync with each other. Until, of course, we weren't. Um, but I have no doubt we can get back on track. - What, wow, the, surprises keep coming. Wow, um, and Matheson? - Matheson will return to serving his former clients, and you in return can begin handling Georgia's again. - Okay. - Yes, you really must come back, Diane. I'm just not willing to go any longer without you. - I'm, I am so flattered that you guys took the time, and you flew all the way out here, but, you know, surprising as it is, but the phones actually do work here. You could've just called. - There's nothing like a good face-to-face. - Yes, I agree, Henry. - I, I just, I can't really, can't really leave right now. My, my girls, they're, they're finally settled, and Aubrey's halfway through the school year. It's just. In all transparency, I probably can't leave until May. - No, no, no, no, no. I, I mean, yes, ideally I was hoping you would come back with us now, and I, I guess I could wait a couple of weeks for you to get your things in order, but months? - We were really hoping that you'd be able to come back with us and begin the fall campaign right after the beginning of the new year, at the latest. - I, I just, I need, I need some time, guys. - Sure, sure, take all the time you need. - Diane, seriously? Is there much to really think about? I guess there's nothing to discuss further. Diane, lovely to see you. I look forward to more. Shall we, Henry? - We're driving to Charleston tonight, and we're heading back to the office tomorrow morning, if you change your mind. Diane, I don't need to tell you how much this means to everyone. - I'll let you know. - Don't worry, everything same as before. - Same? I don't know if that's gonna work. You hear what she said. She needs me. - We'll talk. - Will we? - Yeah. Take care, it's good seeing you again. It'd be great to have you back. - You too, Henry. Wow, this is, this is an awesome surprise. - Well, I don't mind doing dishes, and I know you've been working really hard, so. - I appreciate that. Honey, are, are you happy here? - What do you mean? - You and Aubrey, are you, are you girls happy here in Marion? - Well, Aubrey could be living anywhere and be happy. - That is very true. She seems to absolutely love Mister. He's, he sleeps with her now, which is amazing. - Honestly, it's not as bad as I thought. I mean, I like working at the store, and the people are so nice here. And, you know, Francis Marion University is just down the street. I was thinking of starting to take classes. - Wow, honey, that would, that would be amazing. That's awesome. Why the, why the change of heart? - Well, we seem like a family now. I mean, before it didn't really seem like you cared, but that's all really changed. - I have always cared about you, okay? I know I didn't always do the, most amazing job in the world of showing it. But no matter what, I will always, always love you. The most important thing to me in the world is that you and your sister are happy. - I do miss LA, but I, I really like it here, too. - Yeah, it's not, I definitely see what you mean. - That's the laundry. - Wait, pinch me. You, you did the, laundry? - Yeah. - My God, you're amazing, thank you. - Mom, I'm sorry for being so angry with you and blaming you for the divorce. I know Dad never really treated you well and I'm really sorry. - Honey, honey, that's okay, really, I am just so happy that you're not angry with me now. I love you. - I love you too, Mom. Laundry. - Who are you? What have you done with my daughter? - Well there's a good-looking couple.

Well, you look pretty in that dress. - Thank you. - And a crazy dog. - Come on. - Hey, B! - Hey, you. - I wanted you to see that I'm so happy you're here. Y'all, Bianca's here. - Y'all? - Ssh, ssh, I didn't say that. - Guess what I found? - What? - I think I found a loophole in the one-year stipulation on this place. - You're kidding me. - After reviewin' the will, now, it says that you must live in the house any time within the next year. It did not specify you livin' here a whole year. Now, am I your girl, or what? Now, come on, what's the plan? - Honestly, I, I don't know what to do. I mean, the girls, they're just, they're so settled here right now, but then Henry comes and offers me this incredible raise and a partnership track. It just, I don't know what to do, and he wants to know by next week. - What decision is there to make? Come on, you actually like staying here? - Well, I'd be lying if I said going back to didn't give me some kind of comfort, I mean, it's my home. - But? - This feels like home, too. - And what about the incredible Hulk in there washin' dishes, - Luke, yeah. He's, he's amazing, and things are really. - Heating up? - Yeah, yeah, I think so. B, I, I haven't felt this way in such a long time. He helped me fix up this house and the girls, they just, they love him, you know? And it's, like, I can't help but be attracted to him, like, even though I try not to be as hard as I can, I am. It's like we're magnets, you know? But then on the other hand, this was just supposed to be temporary. I don't wanna hurt him again. - And? - And now I am totally and utterly confused. - Hey, you ladies need anything from the kitchen? - Actually, I'm gonna go, um, check on Aubrey. I, put her to bed a while ago. - I'll help. - B, if you want some more wine, there's some right over there. - Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine. - DJ. It is not like me to make big overtures like this, but I'm just gonna do it anyway. I've tried to stay away from you, DJ, but I just can't. I don't want you to go. I want you to stay here, be with me. - Luke. - We're happy here. You're happy here. We could make a life and be happy together. I mean, I could take care of you and the girls. We would, we would take care of each other. Come on, let's finally live the life we were always meant to live together. - Do you know I haven't felt this way in, my God, such a long time, maybe, okay, never. - Then stay. I love you, DJ, and I know you love me, too. I already lost you once, I don't think I could do that again. - I do, I do, I love you. This was just, this was just supposed to be temporary. - Things change. - I know, and they have. You are, you are so, so, so incredibly special to me, to my girls, and I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't wanna lose you again either, but. - But? - Just, I, I can't be a waitress for the rest of my life. I, I have a career that I worked so hard for. You've no idea, and Henry, he just gave me this raise with this partnership track and I, I mean, I can't just throw all that away, because I, I have a boyfriend. - Is that all this is to you, is a fling? - No, no, no, no, that's, that's not, that's not what I meant at all. Okay, that's not... - 'Cause to me, you're someone that I wanna spend the rest of my life with. And, what, what was I to you? Someone just to fix things around the house, or to pass the time with? - God, no. - Until you get around to doing what you always do. - No, no, no. - Is that it? - My God, it is so not like that. I never said that. Look, please, I just, you have to understand I'm just, I'm just, I'm confused, okay? I don't know what. - You're gonna leave. That's what you always do. You did it that summer, and you're doing it again. - I'm just, I'm just confused. I don't. - Right. No, you don't know, you don't know what you want? - No, no, I. - Let me make this easy for you, DJ. Goodbye. Goodbye for good. - Georgia, actually, I just got the prints. Yeah, how 'bout I take a look at them, and I'll get back to you, does that work? Okay, great, okay, talk soon, bye. What's next? Please, please, please say nothing. - Well, you need to leave in 10 if you're gonna make it to your appointment, and a Penelope G's on line two. - Penelope G? - She said you worked with her a while back. - Hi, this is Diane. - Hey, Hollywood, it's you're old friend Penny. - Penelope G? - Well, you know, I use Penelope when I'm doin' business. - It took me almost 40 years to find myself, and about four months to lose my mind. Why did I ever leave you guys? - You know what, we're wonderin' the very same thing, and we miss you. - Honey, I miss you guys, too. - All right, all right, enough chitchat. I have some business to talk to you about. - Okay, okay, hit me with it. - The board of tourism around here is lookin' to make Marion County the go-to springtime destination of the South, and they're looking for a new economic developmental director, and that job is yours. I mean, if you want it. Of course these things are best discussed face-to-face. - Hey, actually, can I call you right back? - Well, all right, call me back. - Okay, send everybody my love. - So how's it feel to be back? - It's, it's insane. - Well, if anybody can handle it, it's you, right? - Five minutes. - Looks like I caught you in the thick of things, so I'll be brief. Georgia wants to meet tonight for a working dinner. - I can't. - What? - I have plans, in fact, if I don't get outta here I'm gonna be late, and I can't be late. - This is Georgia we're talkin' about. The woman doesn't know the meaning of the word no. - You're the boss. You'll figure it out. Hi. Hi, Mister. Hi. Hey, Squeaks. - You're late, Lady. - Three minutes, kid. - Well, come on. - Come on, you heard her. - I made the grilled cheese. - Helped. - It's perfect for a night with my girls. Honey, are you, are you okay? Do you have to go to the bathroom? Go ahead. - No. - Then why are you so wiggly? - 'Cause of your surprise. - Shh! - What surprise? - Hope you don't mind me crashing your dinner, or should I say two little birds told me that you were pretty miserable. - Two little birds, I see. Wonder who they were. So, you, you just felt bad for little ol' me? - Not at all. I was actually quite happy when I heard you were miserable. - Thank you very much. - Listen, I'm sorry that I left you the way I did. - It's okay. We're even. - I wasn't trying to get even. - Okay, not in front of the kids, please. - Let's just promise to never leave each other again, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - There's only one way to really guarantee that we'll stick to it. DJ, will you marry me? - Are you serious? - I am not kidding. I want you to marry me. - Yes, yes. Dear Henry, it's been an honor to work for you for the past 20 years. You have been a great mentor and friend to me, and I am so grateful for my time at the agency, but there comes a time when one must move on and begin a new chapter in life, and for me that time is now. You suggested that I take a break to figure out what I wanted in life, and I did. With that in mind, I, I must give you my resignation. Please don't worry about Georgia. Sarah, my assistant, can handle things from here on. I've been training Sarah and while, yes, she's, she's green, she's been my exceptional right hand for the last couple years, and she knows it all backwards and forwards. In time, I think she'll prove to you that she can be the next version of me. She's young, hungry, and ready to take on the world. For me, it's time to start enjoying that world. So, thank you for everything, Henry. All my best to you and my now former colleagues at Broadhill. And if you ever find yourself back in South Carolina, stop by, just not with any job offers, and definitely not with Georgia again. And P.S. don't forget to call your mother on Sunday. It's Mother's Day.
