Hello? Séan? Hello? Mum? Mum? No more bets now, thank you. 22 black. - Cash change? - Yeah. - Yeah? - There we go. Just throw it on seven, then. -On seven? -Yeah. -All on seven? -Yeah, no, no, no. Put it in the corner, seven and eleven. Seven, eleven, we'll call it, yeah? -Sure? -Yeah. Okay. Place your bets now. No more bets now, thank you. No more. 18 red. 16 black. Thank you. Place your bets now. I'll call him for you. Thanks, I really appreciate that, mate. It's just, you know, I'm getting a new phone. -It's okay, mate. -All right. There you go. Thanks, bud. I'll be outside. Yeah, today. This afternoon. I thought-- Yeah, no. They-- they said they'd let the family know, Séan. Yeah, no. I thought I might see you. Criminal? The-- the Grim? He-- he's Séan's brother. Yeah? Séan? The dealer? No wonder he's trouble. Did time for what? He's not a dealer. How many times-- Robbery. All right, he crashed the car, he did a runner. Okay, he used to be a pro driver. Really, he was very talented. Just used his skill on the dark side. Don't laugh. Honestly, he was really good. I'm surprised you never heard of him. Have I 'eck! Did he go to jail for quite a bit, then? Someone got hurt. One of them had a gun. Wasn't his fault. He's a dick, just like the rest of them. Maybe so, love. Maybe so. I know, where is she? Well, I'll go and visit her. Well, he-- Look, text me the address, will you? Yeah. Yeah, I know, just text it, will you? Please. Look, Séan, I've gotta go. Yeah, I've gotta go, mate. Just text it to Jim, will you? Yeah? Sure. Thanks, mate. I appreciate it. Hold on, Maggie. Hey, Mum. -Séan. -Danny. Oh, Danny. You're so alike, you two. I don't like it in here, Séan-- uh, Danny. It's not necessary at all. Oh, good God. Would you look at it? Look, look at that. When do you think she'd sort herself out? How long have you been in here, Mum? I don't stay here, do I? I'm-- I'm not stopping here tonight, am I? No, no. Did you stay here last night? I don't know. -Did I? -I don't know, Mum. Look at her. Look. Don't point at her, Mum. She's not very well. Where's Séan? I don't know, Mum. I don't know. Can I, um... Oy! Get up! Get up and face me now. Get the fuck up, and get out. He owes me 50 quid! That's nothing, he owes Jacky Mills his house. You're a fucking loser. Hold on, mate. There's no point in clearing this now. Hey. How are you doing? I'm fine. Was it unlocked? No, found a key. Why is it such a mess? Oh, nobody's been here since, well, Dad just gave up. We could have sorted it. It worked out. I can't be coming here and looking after Mum as well. -Yeah, I know, I know. -Nobody gives me nothing. I know. What's she doing in that place? You never said anything. Oh, she doesn't know where she is. -It don't make a difference. -No? -What happened to your mush? -Nothing. You coming out? No, I wanted to stop here, I'm gonna tidy-- Séan! Séan! No way! Hey, come here, boy. Good to see ya. -Hey, when did you-- -Yesterday. Ah, man, it's good to see ya. Ah, I'm sorry to hear about your dad. -Yeah. -How's your mum? You know, stressed, Stan. -She's stressed. -It'll take time. -I'll take time. -Yeah. -This looks quick. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Its not as quick as yours was. Look, Stan, I don't suppose you've got anything going around here, have you? Work-wise? I wish-- I wish I could, buddy. I really wish I could. But we're only just managing ourselves. I mean, I couldn't take you on, it wouldn't be fair. I know, I just thought it was worth asking, that's all. Well, anyway, look, I'll be seeing you. You're busy. I'll-- I'll be getting off. Maybe I'll get a car back on the track, eh? Yeah, maybe. You take care, buddy. Hey, Danny... How'd they ever catch you? Nice one, Stan. If there's no will, Mum, that means you own the garage as well. Well, I don't want it. It's for you and Danny. Yeah, I am Danny. Oh-- I meant you and Séan. What are you doing, big brother? Trying to write me out the will? Yeah, frightfully. Look, there is no will. Yeah. I need to talk to you. Have you seen the deeds to the garage? They should be in here. Little sheaf of papers. Thick paper. Maybe in a folder? No. Maybe in the garage somewhere. Yeah. Dan... Why is Mum home? Look, it's all right. I'm gonna be around for a bit, aren't I? - All right, okay. - Yeah, we'll sort something out. All right. I'm sure they're in here somewhere. Because the deed to the house and the garage, they're both on the same piece of paper. -I know they are. -No. No? Don't know what they look like. There you go. Oh, thank you, Séan-- I-- Danny. I went down to the garage this morning. Has he cleared it up yet? Has he... What happened to the Aston? - My car? - No, my car, Mum. The car. I thought you'd sold it. You told me you'd sold it. I did not. Who sold it? Where is it? Well, perhaps Séan sold it, then. It was a long time ago. I'm not sure now. But-- but my car's still out front there, isn't it? Séan sold my car? I don't know, Danny. Did you not sell it, Dan? Oh, no, Séan. Don't start that again, please. You said you weren't dealing anymore. That's supposed to be for Christmas. I'll put it back. Look, I need a stake. The more I have as a stake, the more we'll have for Christmas. Don't you think I can win it? I know you can. But why do you have to bet on it? Why can't you just race to win? Yeah. I can't, Sue. We need it. I'm on at 20 to one. Séan? Call your brother! Looks a bit better in here. Yeah. I still can't find the deed, Séan. Yeah. I've had them. -What? -Yeah. I gave them to Jacky Mills, as security. What? Look, don't get all funny, Dan. I had to give 'em in 'cause I owed him some money. I'll get them back in a bit. You know who he is, don't you? Yeah, it's all right. I'll get them back. It was his fault your last plan went to shit. -You shouldn't have done that. -Oh, don't get all clever. I'm not getting clever. Just tell us what's going on. Do you know what, Dan? I've got work to do. You don't make yourself, you know. -Who's that? -Oh, God. Danny. Oh, keep going, keep going. Oh. How are you keeping? Oh, she is my protégé. -Female? -Yeah. Yeah, she's really good. Teach you a thing or two, Dan. -It's good line, that. -Yeah. Yeah, she knows what she's doing all right. How's your Séan? Ah, don't ask, Stan. I don't know what he's got himself into. I can't believe he'd even talk to Mills again. What do you know about it? I don't know anything, Danny. I just know, you know, he's talking the talk, isn't he? And throwing money at club races, and... You know, they love to bet, don't they? So, he's trying to earn it back, and-- Did he really borrow money off that-- that bloke? Mills? Casinos and clubs in Blackpool, I mean, he's-- he's a drug dealer. He's a drug dealer, Danny. He's a-- He's the worldwide sort. He's a proper bad guy. This is Paula. Well, am I the one? How did I do? Uh, 148. Yes. Yes. Oh, God. There's no way I'm not driving this on Saturday. -We'll see, we'll see. -Oh. -We'll see, all right? -Oh, come on, you said. Yeah, but I said we'll see, all right? Now, be professional. This is Danny. Oh, Séan's dodgy brother. - How are you? - You know Séan? Not really. He goes out with a friend of mine, Susan Barnes. What? Uh, they got together a couple of years ago. They should have told you. I really thought you were going to win that one, Séan, I really did. Yeah, I-- I could have. Easy. It's unbelievable, really. I think the cylinder head needs changing. Still, next time, eh? It's a real shame. I was hoping that would be beneficial. Yeah, well, me too. Séan, I don't think you fully understand the situation. I've invested considerably in this venture, and you assured me I would be reimbursed. Trying to think of a clever answer? -What? -Don't "what" me, boy. You were trying to think of a clever answer, Séan, and there isn't one. -No, I was just-- -Shut up. Shut up and listen. You're on borrowed time. My time and my money. I want 20,000 pounds by Friday. Or else I keep the bloody garage. No, no, no, no, bastard. I-- I don't owe you half of that. Sorry. Hey! Leave him. Nobody thinks about the interest. -No. -God, that was fun. I really enjoyed that. He is so fucked. Yes, but seriously, keep an eye on him. Because if we don't get the land, the building stops. I mean it. Go on, get in. Look, Stan, I don't know. I haven't driven for ages. Oh, just get in and drive it. You haven't touched a steering wheel for five years. You know you bloody want to. Get in and drive the thing. What? No helmet, no suit? He'll be all right. Yeah, of course he will, he's a man. -Oh. Here. -Unbelievable. Easy on the clutch, mate. That's the last we'll see of that. Thought you said he could drive. You know, the thing is, it wasn't Danny who was the one who was always getting into trouble. It's that little brother of this. Séan? Yeah. Yeah, I think he was jealous at the time and money their dad spent on the car. It was good for the garage and everything, but he was just a bit jealous. Just wasn't as fast. Then he started nicking cars. Little thief. 158. Yeah, not bad. What's he doing? He's, uh... he's going again. What is it? 142. Drives well, this, Stan. Would've given us a run for our money back in the day, this, you know. Yeah, we're really pleased with that. Really pleased with it. We're a serious contender now, you know. GT cup at the end of November. - Yeah, big prize. - Yeah? Big prize, yeah, we certainly came closer to it today. - Yeah? - Yeah. Shame you weren't going that fast when the cops were after you. Paula. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. - I dunno if Stan said, but-- - It's okay. That's okay. It's no harm done. Besides, it's just nice to see you doing your thing, Danny. I don't know what happened, but... I'm sorry you're not still driving, mate. Ah, thanks, Dan. Appreciate that. Still don't know how the cops caught you. -Easy, dude. -Okay, okay, yeah. -Are you all right to drive? -Yeah, yeah. I think it's something to do with the diff. Can you not feel it on that side? No, mate. -How've you been? -All right. -You never came to see me. -No. Well, you know me and the cops. Thought they'd cave me in if they saw me. Mum's not great, is she? -Séan. -What? I said Mum's not been great. She said someone came around to the house, wanted money. What? Oh, for God's sake, Séan. Okay, okay. You never told me someone got hurt, Séan. Everybody knew. -You knew. -No. Pull over, mate. -What? -Pull over, mate. Pull over. Oh, for fuck's sake. -Pull over, Séan. -No fucking way. They'll do us for drink-driving. Pull-- Séan, pull over. Mate, I'm unlicensed. Pull over. -They'll put us back inside. -No, get off the-- -Get off the wheel. -Get it over. Don't, Séan, please. -Look, I'm unlicensed, mate. -That's all right. All right, lads, out the car. All right, lads. Can you tell me why I've stopped you? -No. -Yes, we can. Yeah, um, we were speeding, officer. I'm really sorry. It's just I've not seen me brother for a long time, -and we came out-- -Hang on, hang on. I know you, don't I? All right, can I see your license? Oh, here we go. All right, yeah, get him your license. Sorry about this, officer, it's just, uh-- No, it's-- it's all right. Just do a-- going a bit too fast. Yeah. I bust the sump. And they're gonna do me. Don't you think I know that? I said I'm sorry. They would've put me away. Can't drive it now, let alone race it. Yeah, well, we could have put it on the ramp if somebody hadn't lost the keys. I didn't lose the keys. -Lost the garage. -Yeah, not just the garage. Anyways, it's barred and bolted now. Some guy came round the other day talking about boarding it up. What race, anyway? To get me money back! Don't you listen to a word I'm saying? You never listen. It was always the same. You and Dad, in the garage. -Oh, come on. -Not knowing what I was doing. All right, all right. I'm listening. Tell me about it, what race? Oh, it don't matter. I've got no car. I've got no money. I'm finished. It's all gone to rat shit. Oh, 'cause it's all going so well for me, Séan. I was gonna run that garage. But it's nothing to do with you, is it? Nothing to do with you. Sort it out tomorrow, eh, Séan? Sort it all out tomorrow, but you never fucking do. Honestly, mate. Talk to me. Apologize to me, Séan. -What? -Thank me. For Christ's sake, something. I get nothing from you, mate. You know, the house is on those deeds, don't you? Your mother's house, mate. But I suppose you just wanna get back to Susan tonight, do you? Okay! Got ya! Got ya, Danny boy! I got you! Watch out, Séan, I'm coming for you. You'll never catch me. They'll never take me alive! Hey! Hey! -Hey. -It wasn't me. It was him! Honest, Your Honour! I'm coming for you, brother! Séan, you're worse than your brother. I can't believe you brought him. Of course not. He came with Susan, she's your mate. Anyway, he needed to get away. How do you mean? I just need to spend some time with him, that's all. He's a good lad, you know. He's all right. He just had it hard as a kid. Yeah, well, I mean, so did you. So did I. But you don't go punching people in the face, do you? Yeah, it wasn't really like that. How long did you go out with Susan for? Well, we didn't really go out much. We just sort of stayed in. Serious relationship, then? Yeah. You need a better coat. I can't understand how people come out -without appropriate clothing. -It's all right. It's not that damp. It is all right. Yeah? It's another world down here, isn't it? Hmm. You seen that? Wow. When it's high tide, we'd be under about 30 feet of water by now. I wouldn't mind. Another world. Right here. Peaceful. And drowned. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. Beat my time yesterday, you know. Yeah, it's a fast car. We really need that win, Dan. Stan's all in. Gets the sponsorship, guaranteed. -You do know that, don't you? -Yeah. It's a lot of money. Really good of him to bring us all out tonight, wasn't it? Yeah, he likes you. Really likes you. Yeah. We all like you, too. Yeah. You know we're not supposed to be in here, - don't you? - Yeah, I know, and that's why we're being quiet. What are we doing, Séan? Stop your horses. We're nearly there. You're kidding me. Séan, you're kidding me. Couldn't get rid of that, could I? Mum said you sold it! Well, it's complicated. -You've not even-- -I didn't touch it. I wasn't allowed to touch it, was I? Oh, don't be like that. I might have said it was stolen. Might have claimed on the insurance. I might've told Mum that it was stolen, but I never touched it. Séan. Séan, it's just the alarm. Yeah, I know, but it'll stay on. -What's going on? -Nothing, Mum. What are you two doing out here at this time? -We're not doing anything. -For fuck's sake. Séan. Let's get back inside. Mum, let's get back inside. I was just wondering what you were doing down here. What were you gonna do, Mum? Start a fight? -It's the middle of the night. -We could've been anybody. Yeah, just-- just leave it, Séan. - She set the alarm off. - Turn it off! All right, I'm trying! Where is that bloody torch? Go on, let's get you inside, get inside. - Where is it? - Use mine, use that, you idiot. All right, all right. - Turn it off. - I'm trying! - Full English. - Cheers, yeah. Thanks. And he never tells me anything, Dan. He's hard work. He doesn't talk to me. I've got no idea what's going on. Can't you talk to him? That's between you two, Susan. Honestly, I don't know what you want me to say. I know I didn't come to see you... But-- but it all started with Séan, and-- Yeah, about that. Oh, come on, Danny. What was I supposed to do? I wasn't the one running around ripping people off and getting people shot. You can't come over all innocent. Don't you think I know that? Look-- I thought you might come to see me at least once. I mean, I didn't know if you were all right. You could've told me what was going on. I didn't know whether you were pining for me. Pining? -Are you kidding? -Well, not pining. People die in jail, you know. You didn't die. No, and you weren't pining. I'm sorry. Ah, it's all right. It's all right. You're right. And he never has any money, Dan. Honestly, Susan. Clock's ticking, kiddy. What? I said the clocks are ticking. You better have what you owe Séan, boy. Nice to see you again, sweetheart. See you Saturday. Careful. What the hell was that? He's a dildo who works at the Royal for Jacky Mills. Is he after Séan? I don't know. I think we better go. Hang on. Susan, tell me what's going on. Oh, leave it, Dan. Honestly, leave it. -He's in a mess. -Does he owe him money? He owes him a fortune. He thinks he can win it back. There's a race on the first. -But he was-- -Ah, but his car. Well, now he doesn't have one, does he? No, he doesn't. Even then, he never won anything. I don't know why he keeps doing this. Welcome to my world, Susan. Tim. Tim. Tim, I need to talk to you. I can't now, I have customers in there and I really need to sell something. Unless you're in the market. What, for a Merc? No, no. I need a place on the grid for Saturday. lWe're ram-jam full, mate. I'm-- I'll try my best, but you blew your gearbox. I sorted it. Please, I need to be in it. -Please, Tim. -I can ask Borty, but-- That's all I wanted. Thanks, Tim. -Thank you. -Mate, I've gotta go. -Cheers, Tim. -Okay, cheers. Cheers. Cheers, Tim. SW Marks Sports? Danny boy! Well... What do you need? Well, depends what it is. Yeah. Well, I'm sure we could do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When do you want it for? Is that a V8? Is that you? Hang on, I'll come out. Hang on. You told me this had been sold. I-- What's going on? I-- Why do you want it refit? I don't want any trouble, mate. Look, I won't lie to you. It's not good, Stan. But there was nobody else. -I'll be gone by morning. -No, don't like it, Danny. Please, Stan. You'll be gone by the time we open. I will. Will what? He will nothing. -Nothing. -Wow. God, what's this? It's a car, ignore it. Let's go. What are you two up to? Nothing. Come on. Well, I'm going. You can come with me if you want. Well, Stan, Stan, what about my telemetry? We'll do that in the morning, don't worry about it. Oh, well, Stan, what's going on? There's nothing going on. - What's going on? - Thanks, mate. Just keep it like that, you'll be fine. God! Oy... -Oh, God. -Paula! I ju-- I just brought these. I thought they might be useful. Yeah. Well, they would. They would be useful-- We don't-- we don't want you, uh, getting caught again, do we? No. I could've... Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. You can drown in shallow water, you know. -What? No. -Yeah, you can. You can drown in shallow water. Well, I can't. Well, if you think about it, it doesn't take a lot to cover your nose or mouth. Why wouldn't you just stand up? -Well-- -Well, sort of stand up. Think I'm drowning here and stand up. Well, what if you were injured? Well, that's definitely worth considering. I'll give that some thought. Here, come this way a bit, that one looks really shallow. I'll do it. You can't, Danny. It's my problem, I'll fix it. Look, Séan, look. I know you wanna do it. But let me. Look, it's my thing, you know it. You kept the car, Séan. Let me drive it. What do I do? - What? - What am I for? I'm the spare. -You're the heir, I'm the spare. -Oh, rubbish. What's it all about? All this. All this just ends. I know, bud. But it's not ended yet, has it? We're here now, aren't we? Punching each other in the eye, aren't we? The Jones boys. I just need to be somebody, Dan. You are somebody, Séan. You've got friends and family that love you. Not everybody's got that. You're still young. You're strong. You're clever. And we'll get through this, Séan. We will get through it. Hey. We're men, aren't we? Yeah. Hey, do you remember when you used to race cops down the bypass? They weren't catching you, mate, were they? Yeah, it was Crabtree. Yeah, the old sod couldn't get the car in gear. He nearly caught you loads of times. Never did. Do you remember when you dumped the car and pegged it across the field? Oh, God, I was hiding in a ditch. And then Mum let Patch out. -Just ran straight to me. -Of course, it did. I thought, if he's gonna shine a torch up here, I'm absolute toast. That was-- Oh, God. You know, when they banged me up at night... When Dad was ill... I thought I might as well be dead in here, Séan. I thought... I wish he could have a pint with us, Séan. What's with the plastic urn, Séan? Oh, that's what they gave us. They said it was biodegradable. I thought Mum would-- Well, I thought she'd bury it or something. She won't let me touch it. We gotta sort something. -We'll sort it out, mate. -Yeah? We'll sort it out. Don't take me for an idiot, Séan. Look, you can't lose, can you? -You've got a bloody nerve. -You can't lose. If I win, I pay you 20 grand. If I lose, you keep the garage. Come on. -I don't think so. -Oh, come on. -No. -I can win. I think that's highly unlikely. Oh, come on. Everything I own are on those deeds, and you know it. So, you'll be driving it? I'll be driving. You'll be driving that car on Saturday night? I will. And if for some unforeseeable reason the car loses, I take immediate possession of the garage and the house. Yeah. I don't understand you, Séan, I really don't. You can't accept the fact you've already lost. You think I can win. -Nah. -You do. You're scared I'll win. I sincerely doubt it. You're a loser, boy. You're going to lose. Why are you watching this, Mum? I like the company, Séan-- Danny. It's nice for me since we lost your dad. But it's rubbish. Well, we can switch it over if you'd like. What would you want to watch? They're looking that place down behind the garage, aren't they? There's a big fence around it, wha-- what are they doing? Are they? You know they are, you told me about it. Oh, is it for that big place? That big pub or something, a-- a hotel? I-- I don't know, Mum. Who told you about it? Oh, I forget now. Could have been Jean at the shop. She told me they wanted to buy her place, as well as the garage. You never said anything. -What-- -Well-- We don't want to sell it, do we? I mean-- I mean, you're going to run it, aren't you? Be serious, Séan. What is the point of racing if we haven't got a stake? I thought you had it sorted. -Money, Séan. -Yeah, I know. That's the problem, I don't got any. But I'll get some. I just need to sort something out. -I'll come up with something. -Oh, please. Come up with something. Things always really work out well when Séan comes up with something. All right, you get some money, Mr. A-levels. Mr. Pole-sitter. I thought you had some put away. You always have money. Yeah, I've been a little bit preoccupied these last few years, haven't I, Séan? Or maybe we could borrow some. No, forget about it. We haven't got any credit. Besides, I'm not exactly bankable, am I? Well, perhaps I can get a loan. No, forget about it. We could pawn stuff. Have you got anything we could pawn? She's not pawning anything. You need to focus on your driving, you know you do. You're gonna keep outta this. You never stop, do you? Honestly, you lose two grand gambling, and then you double or nothing with Jacky Wanker. And if that's not mad enough, you give him the deeds to the house. I mean, Séan, you-- The deeds to the house. He's actually holding the deeds. Hey, I think I've got it. Do you guys know what a title loan is? This, my friends, is 10,000 quid. We have a title loan. -Yay! Excellent! -Yes! Is it enough? Yeah, I'm on it five to one. That's 50,000 bills. - If I win, I'm gonna-- - Hang on. When I win, we pay off the garage, and we go to work. Yeah, okay, okay. He says we've got to pay off in a month if we want to keep the car. -We want to keep the car. -We wanna keep the car. We wanna keep the car. What could possibly go wrong? Cut to the scene where it all goes tits up. This is 5-1. Hi, Sally. Go ahead, 5-1. Can you do us a check on Yankee, Sierra, six, five, Yankee, Lima, Uniform, please? All right, Dave. Yeah, that's coming back. Yellow, Robin, Reliant. Registered to Mary Potts, DOB 16/01/39. Of 23 Hastings Ave, Morecombe. All right, Dave? 5-1? We have all your teams here, from all over the UK. Manchester, of course, that's Falkirk, and as far away as St Ives, I think. this morning, after a very long drive. I'm sure they will still have some miles in the tank... How're you doing? A few announcements before the first race, so bear with me. We will do our housekeeping. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, whereabouts? Okay. All right, see you in a bit. See you on the track. Come on. Come on. Line's busy. Little sod. I told him I'm driving! Honest to God, what is the point of all this? They never would've known it was me. They can't tell the difference between chalk and fucking cheese. Stay calm, Danny. Stay calm. We'll get there, and we'll talk to him. Just stay-- Calm. Can I drive? Back up a bit, kid. -I said back up. -All right. You ain't gonna want your mates to see this. Oh, God. This is a call for the paramedic team. -Paramedic team... -Have you seen our Séan? ... make your way to the car park entrance on the south side. That's paramedics to the car park... Dan, what's that? Séan! What happened? Séan, mate, are you all right? He took a bit of a beating, mate. - Séan! - Are you a friend of his? He's me brother. You all right, mate? I've called the ambulance, it's on its way. Are you all right, matey? What happened to him? The cars are now taking their places on the grid for this final race today... ... races today, who will be competing against cars in their own class... Oh, nice one. So, he's definitely out of the race? Mission accomplished. Good lad. Good lad. Look, uh, whilst you're there, can you put another two grand on the young chap in the Toyota? Yes. Yes, just do it, Don. Don, just do it. Yeah. ... who will be competing against cars in their own class, and should make this next race something very special, indeed. And our final race this afternoon is the Championship Cup Open GP event for cars over two liters. This is a qualifying event for the National Championship Cup. So, we expect to see some rather fast times here today. We have just enough time to announce the winners of this afternoon's CityCar Cup, our new formula this year, which is bringing motor sport to a much wider... Yeah, it's me. ... our new formula this year which is bringing motorsport to a much larger audience. I'm happy to announce that the winner of that race was a veteran of the circuit, and a very dear friend of mine, Tim Evans. So, Tim, if you'd like to... You were arrested in possession of a stolen car. The same car that's been witnessed speeding on the A570. The car doesn't have the correct plates. No. The plates aren't registered to you, are they? For the tape, Officer Hepworth has just entered the room. Something you might be interested in, Helen. Thanks, Pat. Okay. Okay, Danny, so it seems he's supposed to be reporting in. You're on probation, I take it? -Yeah. -Okay. Interview suspended at 1:15 a.m. I'm going to get us all some coffee. Want a coffee, Stan? Can I get us both one? I'll get us both one. Keep your weight off that foot. I'm all right. You all right, Mum? - Oh, Danny. - You all right? Lovely. Yes, I'm all right. Well, actually, I'm not, but-- but never mind. Uh, what are you doing here? What do you mean, are you okay? Yes, I'm-- I'm all right. I just-- just had a little fall again, that's all. -Oh, Mum. -No, it's-- I'm all right. I'm fine. Now, let's not spoil the day. What-- what are you up to? Have you been out today? I'm not sure, Séan-- um, um, Danny. Mum, have you been out this weekend? - Not sure. - At all? I wanted to tell you something. Now, what was it? - I'm going barmy. - It's all right. I'll get us a cup of tea. Shall I put the kettle on? -Yeah. -All right. I'll put the kettle on. Heya. Um, Noreen, are you gonna go with Emily? - All right. - Yeah? - All right. Come on. There you go. All right. -She'll be fine. -Yeah. -Okay? -I'll be in touch. Yeah, take care. Speak to you soon. Hey, Dan, you're getting soaked. Look, you don't have to watch this. Why don't we go and get a coffee? Hey? Or what about a drink? Yeah? Should we get a drink? Excuse me, Daniel. Daniel. Do you understand that's there for your own safety? -Yeah. -Leave it. I said leave it. Can you not hear me, mister? Tell this idiot to get off. I wouldn't advise that if I was you, Mr... -Don. -Mr. Don. And Mr. Mills? I think we've met before. I think it would be wise for you to stand your men here down, don't you? There really is no need for this kind of thing. And it's a difficult day for Danny, as you know. I don't actually believe we've had the pleasure. And really, I'm not concerned as to who you are. Now, if you don't mind, we've got work to do. Sorry, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Nigella Geoffries. We met at the Crown Court, I'm quite sure. I'm representing Daniel Jones here. This is his property, and remains his property until land registry completion. Which, I'm sure you've forgotten, isn't 'til next week. Well, I believe it has already taken place. No, no. Not quite, Mr. Mills. It's the 27th? Completion date is set for next week? I think you should just speak to my solicitor. Of course, I have. I have an email from him, stating next week. You're trespassing, mate. Jesus Christ. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, Jacky. We can't start anything today. Nobody's insured. If this is true, I'm really not happy with this. Sorry about this, lads. You haven't gone yet. Don! - You are-- Fuck you. - Yeah, really? Get out of the fucking way. Bloody fuck. Just do one, mate. -How's your ankle? -It's fine. Fine. -This is Nigella. -Oh, hi. I'm Paula. -Pleased to meet you. -That was interesting. Actually, that was technically assault. I mean, I think we believed you were under a genuine threat of physical harm, so... Very interesting, Paula. I'm sorry, Dan. Oh, there's nothing to be sorry for, Séan. No, no, I mean it. Listen, I'm sorry. Look. Rest, Séan. It just doesn't matter now, does it? I should never have asked. You didn't ask. It was Dad. He didn't want you going to prison. He wanted you with him. He always wanted you with him, Séan. Séan, you'd have gone down for ten years. I miss him, Dan. You gonna stand there all day, Danny? I know work fascinates you. Sorry, Stan. Can you pass me a pair of clippers around there? -Here you go, mate. -Cheers. So, if she does that again, it'll just give way, and it won't break the skirt. You have all the best tricks, don't you? She's good, Dan. She is. She's really good. -But you-- Oh, leave it, Stan. I'm finished. Enter it, Dan, you could win it. Leave it. Besides, it'll break her heart. She's your driver. Yeah. Yeah, she is. Yeah. What are you gonna do, Dan? She says you got a lawyer? Yeah, if you learn one thing inside, Stan, and that is you need a good lawyer. She says if I pay off the lean on the garage, I can stop it all. What about Mills? I thought he had all the deeds? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Apparently, it's all electronic now. I pay it off, I can save the house, the garage, it's easy. Well, that's great, then. Dan? Yeah, I can't do it. I haven't got any money. I haven't got any job with no car. Séan's just crawled out o' hospital and me mum, you know-- Ah, yeah. I've got to surrender back into custody, Stan. The other night, the car. You can't do anything when you're on parole. You can't break any laws or anything. Séan's bitter madness the other night was enough. That wasn't you. That was him. He took the car, not you. Yeah, but they won't believe me, Stan. They won't believe me. They've got a warrant. -I've got to do it. -Oh, no. Danny, it wasn't you driving the other night. And it wasn't you driving... Dan! Danny! 36 red. There we go, thank you. Do you want change? -Hey, hey, hey! -Ah, get off. Having a nice time, are you, Séan? Hey, that's me bad arm, Paula. Oh, so what? So what? No. -Get off! -I wanna have a word. - You guys okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're fine. Sorry, we're okay. You're not leaving, I wanna have a word. - No, I wanna have a word. - Get off! Séan. Thanks, that's great. Thank you. You not run off, then? It's not healed, this, you know. -Your brother is in prison. -Yeah, I know. Yeah, you know, and do you not think you're responsible? Don't you think he was trying to sort out your mess? My mess? Why is it my mess? Oh, yeah, 'cause things are going great for Séan, aren't they? Yeah, sorry, I forgot. Yeah, going great guns, aren't they? -Look at yourself. -Oh, get lost. Séan, where are you going to live? And what about your mum? I can't believe you let him turn himself in. Well, they were gonna pick him up anyway. Yeah, but it wasn't him driving. -It was you. -So? God, unbelievable. Unbelievable. Listen, Séan. Your brother loves you, and all you do is just mess him around. Oh, yeah, it's my mess. It's always Séan's mess. Yeah, actually, yes, it is. Guys, can you keep it down, please? Sorry. Listen, Séan. You know, it's not your brother's fault that things don't go right for you. You just cannot keep blaming everybody else. Séan! He's in prison. Sorry, guys, can't keep up with the shouting in here, otherwise, you're gonna have to leave. All right. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. We'll just have our drinks, and then we'll go. -Okay. -Sorry. Sorry. Let's go. Séan, you can't leave him in there. I know. I know. He's paid his dues. He shouldn't have been in there in the first place. -Let's go. -Séan. I fucking hate it down here. I like it. It's cold. What are you gonna do, Séan? I don't know. Get some money. Get a drink. -All right. -Cheers, fella. Nice one. -Have a good evening. -Yeah, take it easy, man. Drive safe, yeah? How's your mum? All right. Have you told her what you're doing? - No. - Good. - I thought she'd-- - Listen. I'm sure you're realizing I'm not really that interested. So, can you just carry on with what you're doing, and a little bit faster, please. Okay. Fuck off. Someone to see you, boss. - Who is it? - Guess. Who is it, you dickhead? Go on, mister. Sit. What can I do you for, Séan? All right. What do you want? -Turn that bugger off. -Fuck off. Tell him to leave, and I'll tell you. Tell me now. Nah. Tell me now, or else Don here might have to break your other arm. Get off, you fucker. I've got something for you. Tell him to get off. Get off, you bastard. Go on. Go outside for a bit. Pouf. Fuck off. Is it broken? Anyway, what do you want? I need to make some cash. We all do, I believe. I used to make loads for Simmo. Before he, well, you know, went away. Yes, very interesting that, wasn't it? Yeah. Very interesting. Anyway, let's get back to you. - What do you want? - I've got a stake. -A down payment. -Nah. Ten grand. Just in case it crosses your mind, the garage is already mine. And will remain mine. I just want a start. You fucked me up pretty bad. -Where are you gonna work? -Well, round our end. I know loads of kids up there that used to buy off Simmo back in the day. Even if you made me money, you'd lose all yours on black. Yeah, maybe, but I'll tell you what, I'm gonna make you more money than that kid I passed outside. Look. Ten grand. How the mighty fallen. Don. Don. Don! Yeah? Take him down The Royal and give him six bags. -All right. -No, no. Let me have a cake. You can't have a full brick for $10,000-- -I can sell it. -You might not. It can be very unlucky for people owing me money, you know, Séan. They say they'll pay me back, and they try. They really try, Séan. And I wait, and I wait. And they try and... and they seem to have terrible accidents. You know, I wouldn't like to owe me money. Very unlucky. Oh, for God's sake, give it to him. Move. Don't shove it up your nose, you dickheads. Now, you know what this means, Séan? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hi, Nigella? - Yes. -Are you DC O'Hare? -Yeah, that's right. -I believe you're got-- -Yeah. One second. Is that it? You can go, Danny. Thanks. Thanks, Nigella. -Thanks very much. -Thank you. - He's a loser. - Oh, don't say that. Well, he is. Would you've stood by and let him get arrested for something you did? Look, it's not as simple as that. Well, you know, sometimes it is. What good does it do, Dan, just to keep ignoring it? You know, you've really got to stick up for yourself. Yeah, look, it doesn't matter what he does now, anyway. Besides, I don't wanna talk about him. How's your car? Yeah, it's pretty good, actually. Yeah, and Stan's rebuilt the engine. Think he's even put a new camshaft in it. -Has he fixed the side panels? -Oh, very funny. Um, yeah, he has, he has. Uh, yeah, he has. Oh, it's a shame because I would've won that. You'll win the next one, though, won't you? Well, you know, unless you want to drive it. No, forget it. You know, he'd have you in a heartbeat. -You know, he would. -I'm not driving it, forget it. It's really big prize money, Dan. -Yeah. -And, you know, his sponsorship - kicks in right away. - Yeah. And, you know, he's even talking to the bank! We might have two cars. Yeah. Hey, be careful. We nearly drowned then. Oh, get lost. I'm just saying, be careful! I said, we could drown in shallow water. I know! I'm saying. Oh, shut up. Come on. -I won't disturb her, though? -She's absolutely fine. She settled in really well. Hasn't she, Emily? Oh, yeah, she's really loving the TV as well. -Is she? -Yeah. She's a pleasure to have, absolutely. -All right. -Okay? -Thanks a lot. -No problem. Don't worry. -I'll be in touch. -Yeah. All right. -Thanks a lot. -Take care. -All right. -Bye-bye. - How's she doing? - Danny boy! That looked really fast. Yeah, she's a record-breaker, she is. You off somewhere? Yeah, there's nothing going on round here, Stan. I wanna take a bit of a break. You know how it is. Yeah, I wish it were easier, Dan, I really do. Oh, it'll sort itself out, Stan. -It's got to, mate. -It will. -She's off. -She was really moving, Stan. Paula? I'll get the truck. Paula! Paula! Paula! Are you all right? Paula! Paula! I'm so sorry. Hang on. It's all right. -Sorry, Stan. -God, are you all right? Fuck's sake, let's get you out. Thank God for that. Let's get you out. Ooh. Oh, God, something's not right. Get an ambulance, Stan. That really hurts. - All right, all right. - The ambulance service. You're okay, you're okay. Yeah.. Come on, love. You're okay. "Dear Alex, we..." No, no, no. "Hi, Alex. I hope that the recent... setback won't..." Of course it will. "I am... writing..." Why am I writing? Why am I writing? - Ah... - Stan? Come in, Dan. I didn't mean to disturb you. No, it's all right, I was just... She's beside herself, you know? I know. I blame myself. I mean, I-- I wound her up too tight. Oh, I nearly killed her. I was just trying a different setup, and she said it was too hard. It was an accident, Stan. We all have 'em. That's the game we're playing. She's blaming herself. Either way, we're out. No driver, no car. -Is it-- -Yeah, it's trash, mate. I might as well sell it for scrap. Sorry, Stan. We were this close, you know. Microns. Just a few more microns, and we'd have had it. Sponsorship. You only get a car like that and a driver like that once in a lifetime. I'm really sorry, mate. It's all right, I'll get through... without you. Dan? So, how long do we have to wait? Well, can't we just tell him we won't pay it? Well, we've-- we've got the deeds already. Honestly, what is the point of you? Well, I will get somebody else to do it if you don't get this sorted out. So, think on! Bloody hell. Oh, God, I'm getting bored with this. Apparently, the land is not ours until the land registry idiots say so. The paperwork's worthless. Are you listening to me? For fuck's sake, why am I even talking to you? I was listening. It was just that-- - Fuck off. - Oy! All right, all right. It's me! Keep your hair on. - What do you want? - Well, uh... Don't tell me you've lost it all already? Tell him to do one. I haven't finished me drink. Oh, take it with you. Go on. So, what do you want? I'm pissed off as it is. I need a lot more. You're not having any more until you've paid me for the first-- Well? I thought we were in business. Sit down. Fuck off. How much do you need? I've got a buyer for it all. Used to buy off Simmo, but I need it by the end of the week. That was just the start. I can get five bags by tomorrow. I'm impressed, Mr. Mills. You should be, you little wanker. You fall on your feet, you, don't you? Listen, if this goes well, we could be in business for some time, me and you. Nice one. - How's your arm? - Oh, I can manage. Listen, you better not be messing me around. This is not a game. Where should we meet? -Want one of these? -No. Listen, if they haven't got the money, smack him. Yeah. Even if he says he's bringing it. Yeah. Quite likely he'll stiff us. Hey, who's this? Who's this, then? Patrick, this is Mr. Mills. This is the buyer I was telling you about. Let's have it, then. No, mate. I need to see what you've got. That'll do. -This enough? -It better be. Jack Leslie Mills, you are under arrest for the supply of class-A drugs. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you do not mention, when questioned, something you'd like to rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand? You, you're bloody well fucked! Get off! Easy! Get your head down, you idiot. Come on, Séan. -You know the deal, mate. -Yeah, I know. You should've driven it. Oh, not this again. You should've driven it, it's all my fault. -Bloody hell, kill yourself! -Well, it is. It isn't. Things happen. Sadly, it's not all about you. It's not all about any of us. It's all crazy random. We're on a rock spinning in space, for God's sake. It's his fault! Hello? Fucking hell. Where is he now? That is fantastic. What about Mills? Couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke. Nigella, that is great news. Yeah. Look after him, won't you? Yeah. No, I will. Actually, yeah, there-- there is-- there is something you could do. Do you know the police compound at Westside? Could you meet me there? Thank you. Yes. No, okay, yeah. I'll text you. I will, I'll text you then. All right. Thanks, Nigella. Thank you. Bye. Bye. You fucker! What is it? -Was it that solicitor woman? -Séan's given himself in. - Brilliant! - Well, it's not really. And Mills, they've got him and that bastard that attacked Séan. Wow, Jacky Mills! -Bloody hell. -He's finished. They say he can't complete on the garage now. That means we can keep the house. Oh, brilliant. Do you hear that, Dad? We're back! Danny... it wasn't you driving, was it? You know it wasn't. Séan nicked me car, didn't he? No, no, I don't mean last week. No. You did time for him, didn't you? He was only a kid. They had stuff on him, he would've gone down for ten years. We looked a bit alike. Me and Dad thought that I'd get away with it. I had a promising career. What? Well, I never thought he'd be able to take care of himself, but... he saved us. He stepped up, didn't he? Yeah, I think he did. Yeah. - I'm gonna go see Nigella. - Dan? Come on! Come on. Shake a leg. Funny. Aren't you the deus ex machina, then? -Sorry? -Saving the day! Oh, yeah, yes. I never did like that Mills fella. -No. -Who does? Um, you've hurt your leg? Ankle. Awesome. Bye, Nige. Yeah, bye. - I think it's done, Stan. - Oh, hi P. I've done my best to come with it. I mean, to be honest, the timing's still a bit out. Not sure about this setup. Why his roll bars are like that, I don't know. It's the way me dad used to set it up, Stan. Oh, hey, no, I've not said it's wrong. No, it's all right, Stan. You've done a lovely job. Honestly, me dad would be really impressed. -He would? -He would! -You sure about these roll bars? -It's the way I like it. Our next race this afternoon is the Championship GT Cup. All entries, please make their way to the grid. This is your first call. Please make your way to the grid in 15 minutes, please, for the Championship... We really need this, Stan. What pressure have we got? Two and a half bar. Let it down a bit, mate. -Hang on a minute, Danny-- -Just a bit, trust me. No, no, we can't afford to blow this. I'm finished, I'll lose my sponsorship, I'm finished! I need this as much as you do, you know that. I'm not gonna lose this car. If I don't win this, I'm broke. I'll have to sell the bloody garage anyway. Then we'll be right back to where we were before Séan gave himself in. Oh, mate, Séan, he's just a mad arse. Stan, look, just-- Stan. Hey! Hey, hey, guys. Guys, focus. We're here, aren't we? And just think about where we were yesterday. Breathe. And just remember how far we've come. All right, I'll do it. You better know what you're doing, Danny boy. Right, then, let's have it. Time to go, let's go. Right then.
