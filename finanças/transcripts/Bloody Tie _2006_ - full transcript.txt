Kim Jiyoung Owner of Luxury Fashion Boutique - What do you want? - Just passing by. - Then keep moving. - The anniversary is tomorrow. - What anniversary? - Your mother's death.

Sangdo, good to see you. - Get them. - Yes, sir. Fucking idiots. Doh Jingwang Busan Narotics Detective Dealers are different from gangsters. Their ultimate goal is to sell drugs, so business comes before loyalty. Investigating through an informant, a good snitch, is the key to success. A dealer who gets caught will sell out even his friends and family. That's what a dealer is. I'm raising this punk as a snitch because he is a born businessman. He even has a beautiful history. His mother burned to death while running drugs for his uncle. - What's going on? - Sangdo's mother is inside. Mom, mom! Let go. Mom, mom! Mom! Let go. His world crumbled around him, so I guess he had no other options. He started at the bottom of the drug chain, and worked his way up. But he's that rare bird that deals, but never shoots up. He's a natural born businessman, this little shit. 4 years ago there was an incident that turned. Doh's partner Detective Choi was horribly killed by Busan's drugpin. That fucking drugpin, Jangchul, cut a deal with the District Attorney by ratting away a huge drug ring got out on bail and fled to China. - How can I go on, I can't live anymore. - Your husband. Shit. Get out! I promise to get revenge for your father's death. Your husband, I'll get revenge. He became a broken man after that. Fucking low-life piece of shit. Blackmailing dealers for cash and sorts, piece of shit! Fucking asshole detective. Fuck. - What a killer view. - It's cold. What do you want? I'm thinking about busting someone and I need your help. Now who was your boss again Chairman Shin? Oh, come on. I've never even seen his face. - You know that already. - Shut up until I'm finished, you little. I'm talking about his right-hand man in charge of distribution. Lee Changjoon. Come on... Here, here. You little shit. Bring that over. We just picked this up from your office. Detective Kim, what's this worth? 200 grams 2 years minimum. What you gonna do? You're screwed, kid. Think you can give up all this and rot in jail for two years? Fucking idiot. Fuck! Stop right there, asshole. Now listen up, you little rat. The country is going down the toilet but you dealers are running rampant so Busan's become too fucked up. Now Busan's District Attorney office is taking over narcotics. So from bottom to top, D.A. Plans to fuck with the entire drug food chain. Just let go first. - Let's lift him up. - Wait a second. - Wait, All right Oh! Shit. - Alright, I won't do it. Shit! I won't do it. Oh, all right. It's for real this time. D.A. Is cleaning it all up. Do you wanna go down with them or do you wanna live? Let me get that right-hand guy. Iwant a medal and a promotion too! If you do your part I'll take care of you. When you meet up to get the drugs just give me one phone call. # Yongdu Mountain # Don't ever change My fucking head. Hello? Yes, sir. Are you here? Yes, I see you. It's really crowded today, right? - Have you eaten yet sir? - Stay alert. You should talk to that owner of luxury. Not paying up on time and shit. Aren't you getting out? What? Where? - What the hell. - By the General Statue? Yes. Lee Sangdo, fucking stupid ass. - Don't mess this up, dumb fuck. - Just worry about your part. - What now. - You kidding me. Hello? - What the fuck? - I don't no. - He says come up. - Up where? General Statue, General Statue!

Lee Changjoon, fucking stupid! Dunno what's right anymore. This is how it is. Need backup. Come on, fuckers! What you doing? Put the knife down. Don't you think you've used her enough? C'mon, you're a man. This should be between you and me. - Put the knife down, asshole. - Shut up. Changjoon, listen We found 2 kilos at her house. - Don't believe, Don't believe him. - Shit!

I was just doing my job, this is just the beginning. Little fucker. What the fuck! So he's the damn hero, huh? You're ready. Come here. Wait. Hold on. I can't, it's dead. What's wrong with you lately? Something wrong? Wrong? There is one thing. I heard this once in high school. It was a saying by that guy Socrates. 'Know Thyself'. Back then I thought it was bullshit. But, when I think about it now I think it really is a wise saying. Why? I'm suffering like this right now exactly because I don't know myself. If you want a way out, get me some money. So that I can set up a small business. Going back to work, right? Reinstated? Should I just quit? Quit. What else you gonna do? Busan Jail Shit. Hey fucker! C'mon, c'mon! Cigarette, give me a cigarette! How much did the lawyer cost? $5,000 for retainer $20,000 for getting you out. That was rent money no more office. It's tough these days. Why? Stuff is getting around but I don't know where from. He's the new guy, Junggoo. They say he used to be a gangster. Anyway, I think he has solid connections. Yeah, it's good stuff? So for his VIP clients he offers a bonus service. Pimping motherfucker. - Auntie. - Come on in. Lying ass, here you are. You lying ass too? Come here. How fucking embarrassing. So? You did what? I mixed some fake shit and sold it. You weren't around. I had to make a living. Idiot! You should've waited a little. Fucking dumb ass. Damn, you are making me go nuts. What the hell does he do at night? You just got reinstated do some work. I'm innocent don't threaten me. Damn it... You keep saying you don't know. Think this is a game? If you say that you're just a mule you can get off with just a fine. - So where is it? - I don't know! Are you two dating? Move over. I love this fabric. Get this in China? What are you doing? Get off me, you bastard. I said get off! Let me go! How nasty hiding it in there. - That's it. Let's go. - Let me go this once. We all gotta live, right? Look the other way and I'll pay you back for the rest of my life. Don't touch me. What do you mean? You've seen it all. - Get her out of here. - Come on. If you let me go, I'll tell you the rumor going around in China. Don't you wanna know? Let me go. It's about Jangchul the drugpin! I made some calls no one's seen Jangchul. Don't you think you're giving that bitch too much credit? At times like this need to start at the bottom. Dealers know before anyone. With that guy around there's no room for us. Maybe, you should meet Detective Doh. When I was in the pen I read a book that said. 'A mind is like a deep forest'. Means you can't trust anyone. - Especially the fucking cops. - Then what do we do? Everyone got sent up the river! We don't have any support now. You've been here all day. You come up with one good idea? You fucker. Hello? You have the wrong number. Of course it's your number little shit! You really suffered, didn't you? Poor kid. Damn, what happened to you? Sorry about the arrest. D.A. Got involved. Here. I got suspended, too. C'mon, take it. Shit. So now that your turf's gone how are you going to live? What kind of cop worries about a criminal? D.A. Bastard all 3 rings, but drugs still hitting the street. In other words, there is no order. When that happens, it's every man for himself, right? So, I think you should get back... What are you talking about? I'm completely clean, off the streets. Before, sorry about what happened. But let's be frank, this is what you've wanted all along, right? There's just one thing I want. The current source I really gotta get it. Well, everyone's hiding and the police make it worse. You need businessman to catch a businessman. Not that you know anything about business. From now on, whatever you do I'll back you up. Okay, okay. I need to take care of this one guy not a big problem, but after I do it I need you to clean things up. So we're on? - Detective. - What? Let me hit you just once. One more time. Hit me one more time! Eight months in the slammer. My losses were astronomical! What you doing? Fuck. Let go of me. Shit! My head became clearer each time this loser hit me. Why I became a cop, and why I'm playing husband to my dead partner's wife. I now see clearly, it's all because of Jangchul. I need to finish with Jangchul. The world is a swamp. Some are alligators, others are alligator birds. If I keep crossing this swamp then one day, I'll become an alligator. What? What, asshole? We're the police! Stay still. Who did you get the stuff from? You got it from Junggoo, right? That bastard sold you out. Sold you out, asshole. - You really the police? - Get that bastard. Let go. I'm calling the real cops. - What the hell! - Shut up. Shut up. Hey... Hey! Sangdo, Let's just dump her. Our goal was to break up their business, not this. Hey, what's gotten into you? Sangdo, Sangdo. Hey, I'm talking here. Hey. Shit, whatever. What a fucking life. Looks like she lived on nothing else for 2 months. They all probably passed her around. You close with her? Then put her in a mental hospital. Then why bring her here? Take care of her for me. What? You turn up out of the blue and expect me to look after her? Just until she cleans up a bit. After that, you can throw her out or whatever. It'll take more than a day or two, idiot. Do I look like a doctor? A doctor can't do it. Doctor would just see a junkie and report her to the cops. C'mon! Get her out of here! Before I call the cops. Hey! Here. The bugs... They're crawling all over me. Here. Let me see. You wanna fuck me too? Come here. I'll give it to you. I said I'll give it to you. Hit me. Harder! Harder! Hit me harder! I said I'll give it to you. Harder! Please, just give me one shot. Just one. It's just too hard... I was so sad after Changjoon died, that I drank every night until I collapsed. One day, someone gave me a drink. That night... If I remember it right... I fucked for 8 hours straight. After that I saw needles everywhere. I shot up again, and again. One day I looked at a cross on the wall... and at the bottom of the cross there was a needle. Have fun? Sangdo! What's going on? - Come again. - Please come again! Sangdo, long time no see. Son of a bitch! Stay still, bastard. You bitches get out. You bitches get out! Stay down. - Who the fuck? - You the fuck now. Life good? Fucking getting drunk like this. - Don't move. - I'm sorry. Put the knife down let's drink and talk. - You have no business morals. - I said let's talk. You okay? That motherfucker. Come here, asshole. Come here! Here's something to show your boss! This is what happens when you sell shit, on my turf! In the 2nd quarter our sting operation eradicated the drug networks, with a 70% increase in drug arrests and... I have a question. Have you heard of the mouse theory? If you see 1 mouse in the cellar, there are at least 100 mice hiding that you don't see. The numbers on D.A.'s chalkboard may be going down, but out on the streets, stuff is available as never before. The D.A. Office must have their heads in their ass. And I'm sure you've heard this. The only method for the police to win in this drug war is to break the law. It's too much for the police. Detectives, leave the drug war to the D.A. Office, Lee Sangdo? Really, what did I do? Are you sure you got the right person? Do you need some stuff? I hear Junggoo's a cripple. So you got some money? A guy with no money shouldn't go ruining someone else's business. Isn't that right? What are saying? Yunsan was always my territory. Just a minute! Wait, who's gonna pay for your losses! Wait! Show some effort. I'll give you 1 week. If you don't You'll end up like Junggoo. See ya. Wait, sir! Sir! Have mercy! You son of a bitch! This is the export manifest. It's confirmed. The fake passport says Kim Taedong. He has a kimchee factory in Harbin. That's what the customs record says. That's why no one has seen him until now. We should give that condom bitch a medal. But my source tells me that Jangchul, is a secret informant for the D.A. There's an official plea bargain agreement. Well, let's see. Could be him, or maybe not. I'm not sure. C'mon, it's him. You know it's him. - Another bottle here. - Yes. The guy in the picture That's Jangchul, right? Jangchul is untouchable. Untouchable my ass! He's just a dealer, like you. I'm a venture capitalist. Quit calling me a dealer. You're a fucking dealer. Hey. You know what a carousel is? The thing the spins round and round. If you get on a carousel you can't get off until the end until the music stops. That bastard and I... are still on the carousel. Going round and round until we end it with a bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Where'd it go? Here... Bang! Bang! What the hell... BANG! After you bust him, you have to help me for 1 year. Got it, got it. - You have to keep your promise. - I heard you, asshole. - I can't trust you. - Okay, fuck. - Okay, okay. - Asshole. And I need to have $35,000 by next week. For what? If I'm to enter his world I need an entrance fee. You tell me this now? Wanna die now? Come here, asshole. - You don't want my help? - What you say? Then forget it. I've got nothing to lose. Are you crazy? Huh? Forget it! Asshole. Come back here. One, two What the fuck! Why you so strong. Madam Shim. I heard you shot up some last week. - Hello? - Collection going well? I'm busy, asshole. Crazy housewives. Damn, what a pain. Madam Shim, $5,000. House of Peace Applause! I dedicate this place to all of us old folks who have gone in and out of the pen for dealing, and now have nowhere else to go. Applause! Applause! We now say goodbye to crystal meth. Goodbye. So on that note let's all have a toast. Cheers! # Flowers blossoming in Dongbaek Island # Spring has come # But our brothers leaving Busan Isn't this Sangdo? You're late. # At every boat I shout out # Where are you my brother # Come back All of Busan's old junkies must be here. What a fuckin' sight. What you doing? With this cold medicine. Listen, I always thought you were different, because you did things your way. Look at those old losers. That might be you in 20 years. Doesn't that scare you? What are your goals these days? Aren't you suppose to find yourself? Find myself? Can you hold me just once? You don't want to? What the hell. - Who's this? - Come get your fucking $35,000! Agreement. I, Do Jingwang, in order to arrest Jangchul the heroin manufacturer and distributor, fully acknowledge the cooperation of informant Lee Sangdo. Therefore I agree to allow and support Lee Sangdo's drug business for 1 year. You want me to stamp this? Fucking asshole. Get out, asshole. You know, this is all to protect our parternership. Just let me live for 1 year. Detective, don't forget. I won't go down alone. You used to work under Chairman Shin? Yes. Yunsan was originally my territory. I'll double your sales from when Junggoo was in charge. I like a guy with balls. Show me what you got! After IMF, Drug Prices Drop, Drug Rings are Back in Action, No Koreans Allowed, Hey, Sergei. Jangchul. He brings in raw ingredients cheap from China, and makes the crystal meth here and sells for a freaking low price! He doesn't just own Busan, but rules over the entire country. Bae Youngnam. Jangchul's right-hand man. Bae Hyungnam. Youngnam's older brother an ex-gangster and now dealer. It's the guy known as the Professor who mixes the meth ingredients. And the only Jangchul and Youngnam can receive the finished speed. That means, only those two know the location of the meth lab! - Hurry up! - Okay, sir. They're headed that way. Tell them I went out on an assignment. You think I'm on a picnic now? - What? - Hello? Yes, sir. - I'm fucking tailing Jangchul right now. - Today? I'm really sorry. Hang up already. Sir, can I call you back in five? I'm really sorry. Yes, sir! That was a top client on the phone. Fucker. Don't get too close. You're too close. Red light, dumb fuck. Want me to stay behind on a red light? - Change the lane or something. - Just calm down a bit, eh? They're gonna see me. That looks more suspicious. Look natural. I got it. Shit. Undercover is not easy, you know? What do you know about being undercover? What's with the sunglasses? I'm an undercover agent! Where are they going? The pier? Paranoid dealers always circle around a couple of times. Shit, how many times are we circling? Motherfuckers. Jangchul is the top for a reason. Oh my god. Where did they come from? Shit, we're fucked. Hey, take a look. Are they gone? I can't look! You look. Shit, but my head's turned. Shit, where did they go? They're for real. They must be going to get the drugs. Let's toast. Cheers. Seven or eight years. That's the average life cycle for guys like you. Make a little money get cocky, land in jail. Then get out and binge. They get pissed because they don't get respect anymore. So they act stupid, get caught go back to jail. Or become hopeless losers. Want to break the cycle? Then don't lose your cool! I'll do my best! My fucking head. It's been three months and no progress at all. We're sold out but a shitload should be coming soon. - What's the quality? - 85% pure. A Grade. Bastard. Straighten up. I hear business is booming. Must be fun, huh? Should I be starving? If I don't get something this month it's all over, got it? I'm locking up everyone for dealing. Starting with you, motherfucker. - My life's also on the line. - You fucking with me? Get out of here. Damn! Hyungnam, what you doing here? Get him! - Sangdo, motherfucker! - Who he is? Open up the door it's nothing big. Oh shit. Oh shit. Not a big deal! Hurry up and piss, asshole. Damn, that's a lot. Listen up, you fuck. This report is all about you. We have evidence that you've distributed 3 kilos. There's also $30,000 on your head. Fucking snitches Sangdo motherfucker... - What did you say? - Let's go by the book. I just had 2 grams on me. Come here, asshole. You fucking with me? Don't fuck with me. Stand up. Strip the fucker. Fucking asshole! You know why I didn't arrest you before? Do you? It was so I could get you along with Jangchul for manufacturing! Come here! You should thank your lucky star for coming here today, asshole. Come here. Fucking bastard. That's enough. You're gonna kill him. What you gonna do? Do 10 years for manufacturing? Hand over Jangchul and just do 2 years for selling. What are you doing? Hurry up and look. How fast do you expect me to recognize. Someone who wears glasses and a mask? Not him, the lab! Where's the meth lab! Shit, how should I know? It's a lab on 4 wheels! Wait, the lab is a van? He must have fucked up big if they won't let anyone see him! If I go to the D.A. For your brother, they'll want something more from me. This time it's 10 kilos. If it goes well we can take it easy for awhile. When is it? 11pm by the fishing pond. Oh shit, 11 by the pond. - We got him! - For real? Shit, forget it. What are you doing? We don't need him anymore. Put him away. Wake up and gather around. Bring me the map where's the pond? Huh? What's so important, this early? - I cooperated a lot. - Right. You did. This here... if you move this down slowly... - That's Sangdo's uncle, right? - Yes. Lee Sangdo... That motherfucker... This is just getting more and more interesting, huh? When did you find it? This morning when I went to recycle the bottles. - Can you keep this secret? - How much is all that? Shit. If uncle gets caught this time he'll get life. Should I throw it away? What? That won't solve the problem. You not eating lunch? What's wrong with her? 2 kilo. 4 kilo. What the hell. It looks like the right place according to Hyungnam. - So Sangdo didn't lie? - No, it doesn't seem like it. So all the rats are walking into the trap all at once? What about Sangdo? Shouldn't we get him first? Be quiet. We can get him later. That bastard can never escape the palm of my hand. Never. For 4 years, no appetite for food or sex. Every morning felt like shit. 4 years of hell. But from tomorrow morning Jangchul will wake up in hell. And from tomorrow morning, I will wake up from a sweet dream and greet a brilliant morning. Don't just stand there. Pay your respect. Nice to meet you, sir! The Professor, and 4 kilo... That's plenty of evidence. And no fool would report that someone stole 6 kilo from him. - How's the place? - Fine. The chance of a lifetime. The perfect crime. Uncle. My nephew come by? You are the reason why I'm in this business. - So it's only right - Okay. That you help me get out. But why did you ask for these guys? Sunggeun, let's blow it up. We're going national. # Taking care of myself # I struggle so hard # Don't look back! # Don't look back! What did you do? Did you steal it? You're a real fuck, you know that? Hey! What's the point of saving a crystal pussy from the sewer? What you think? He wants you to get lost. Your uncle knows everything. But all he would do is laugh, like he had lost his mind. Thanks for the drink. - That's him right? - Looks like it. - Get him! - Fuck yeah! The Professor is moving. Standing by. Okay. Stand by. Coming. The Professor is coming. He's almost here. One. - Two. - Let's rock and roll Three! Get those two. Fuck! Open up! Open up! You bastards! Block that van! Jangchul, how you been, fucker! Remember me? Congratulations, sir! Don't move! Professor, please step out! - Damn impressive! - What is all that? Who the hell are you? Tell me who you are first? What the fuck. What happened to the motorcycles? Who was on it? - What the hell happened? - We lost contact. Calm down. Okay, move it there. They're pretty useful guys. Sangdo. Do you really have the stuff? What the... Fuck! Detective Doh you pathetic piece of shit. You still doing drug stings? Bring me all your documents about Jangchul and this case. I want it all! Dirty work is all done. What? Chief public prosecutor already decided. Get this guy ready for an immediate transfer. Hyungnam's statement is shaky so we have to review it again. The gallon of raw ephedrine in Jangchul's car, is a favor received from China. And those 2 guys who disappeared seem to be the ringleaders. We'll catch them so give us all your documents. - Okay, let's end in good terms! - Sure, whatever you want. What do you call a bad cop? A fucking loser. Where is he? - What were you thinking today? - Deliver the stuff, of course. - What you doing? - Get out of my way! This is just gonna become evidence against us. You are in way over your head. Don't you know Jangchul? - Mind your own business. - Yeah? Whether I go to jail or make a deal don't worry about it. Wow! So, I can just leave? Blood is thicker than water. When I was in fucking junior high. In Junior High you made me deliver. You used your wife and killed my mom. You used your whole family. And then, - Where were you when mother died? - Stop it. You were shooting up and having fun, right! What? Blood is thicker than water? That's a fucking joke, huh? Remember when I was little? I went on a delievery for you and some kids almost beat me to death. Don't you remember? Everyone thought I would die. That time, blood was gushing out my mouth. Blood is really thicker than water! What did you do then, Uncle! That's enough. Enough? Should I stop? You listen to me straight. I'm not here because I was worried about you. I don't care if you go to jail or get killed by Jangchul. I don't care at all. I just don't want to become like you. Understand? Hey! If you've taken all you need, you should close your eyes and run away, like a real dealer. How dare you get mad at me you fucking thief... you fucking snitch. - Crazy bastard. - Think carefully. What are you and Jangchul working on now? You know how many bigger organizations Jangchul helped us to get? He's a national asset, you fuck. No, fuck you! You gonna talk or not! We're going after a drug ring in Seoul. And? We're gonna use Jangchul to set them up. Let me get this straight. He helps you with biggers jobs in Seoul, and you watch his back in Busan. So, that's the job of the D. A? Is this your fucking brilliant plan to move up to the National D.A. Office? Detective Doh... He's becoming a pain in my ass too. When this Seoul job is over I won't get in your way. Just give me three months. Three months? Fuck you! Even three hours is too long! I'm just a fucking loser, remember? I know I'm gonna die soon living this way. So before that, I need to catach Jangchul to get some peace! He's guilty of smuggling, making and selling! I'm going to put him away for at least 10 years! You got it? Hey D.A., You are guilty too, for abetting and blocking an investigation. House of Peace? This is a war zone. Stand up straight. Straight, I said. Fucking bitch. Where are the two crystal brothers? I don't know. Come here. I can lock you up right now. - Where did they go? - I really don't know. For the life of me I can't understand how you dealers and junkies act and think. Why fucking protect Sangdo? The day your boyfriend died why was Sangdo there? A place crawling with cops? What are you talking about? Your boyfriend is dead! Because Lee Sangdo sold him out you stupid bitch. You still think a guy like that is worth saving? You gonna make the call or go down to the station with me? Do you have a cigarette? You bitch! Fucking bitch! Where the fuck is it? - Yes. - Why aren't you answering? We're getting ready to move. Then, let's get moving. But Sangdo give me a hint. Where'd you hide it? I got it buried somewhere. Now where the fuck can my uncle lay low for a year? You bitch! Fucking bitch! What the hell? Get your ass over here you fucking traitor! God damn. You have the wrong number. I said you have the wrong number. 10 kilo. I want to end our relationship with this last delivery. The Professor? Hello? Where you, Professor? Hey! Hey! Where you going? When I go back to jail just send me some pocket money. Hello? Hello? God damn it. - The Detective left. - Where to? - Dae Dong gate. - Okay! What about you? You Okay? He told me about the day Changjoon died. I'll just say one thing. I'm not Changjoon's woman nor am I Sangdo's woman. Bastards with no sense of what's right. So, none of this matters to me. You say that you saved me from the sewer. I give you credit for that. So I do have a debt that I have to repay. I owe you. So, you son of a bitch, just don't die. What? Only 4 kilo?
