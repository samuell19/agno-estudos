What are you doing, Jackson? Oh, I, I'm sorry... Come here, come here. How was your sleep? What'd I tell you about that cereal box, huh? Never touch it. Never look at it, right? I'm hungry, Uncle Jay. Oh, what's that? Come here, what's that? I just wanted some cereal. You wanted some cereal? Get out. Get out. Uncle Jay, I got no place to go. I am not your uncle. I'm sorry, it's gonna never happen again, okay? I promise. As of right now I'm reducing my carbon footprint. It's Vaseline. Ah. ♪ Oh no, wait another minute to my time that comes ♪ ♪ It's just no fun ♪ ♪ Fuck that, I'm done ♪ ♪ I'm just spending my days wasting away ♪ ♪ Nothing to say ♪ ♪ Doesn't matter anyway ♪ Jackson. Hey, Maeve, did you get my voicemail? No. Oh, well, I was kinda wondering maybe, if I could stay with you for a little while? No, you really need to let go of this. You know I can't do that, Maeve, we're connected. All right, bye. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I shoulda done this a long time ago. You did, I said no. Will you marry me? Absolutely not, get up. Look, if you need more time. Hey, come on, get outa here. I completely understand. Oh Maeve, your hands, are you okay? Yeah. I don't burn that fast, that's not how photo-sensitivity works, Jackson. Okay, well I'm gonna use your restroom. I'm on my period. That's what that was. I didn't say anything. Well you didn't flush, so. Oh. Gonna leave a ring. Smells good in here. Yup. Okay, it was good to see you. Bye. You got a little sunscreen on your sunnies. Oh, oh. Forgot I was wearing those. Jackson, we broke up. And it wasn't temporary, you know. You need to move on. I've told you that like eight times. I feel like if you play it all eight times on a loop you would maybe get it. Look, I know your mom died, and you pushing me away. No, it has nothing to do with my mom. Well, Maeve, I. God my neck. Just don't come here anymore, Jackson, please. All right. Another time maybe. Are you freakin' serious? Jackson, get in the car. I crossed the line today, Uncle Jay. There's no ignoring that, okay? Get in the car, Jackson. No sir. Lucinda's been nice enough to let me stay in her backyard. , Lucinda. Get in the car, Jackson. Nope, I'm planting my flag here. I'm all set up, my tent looks good. This is gonna be my new home for a long time, I think. This is a very nice location for me. Yeah. , yeah. Get in the car. Other side. No. Yeah, no, no, April. Now stop interrupting me, please. 'Cause he's your responsibility. Oh, okay. Yeah, well you're sister of the year, aren't you? Oh, do it, do it. I dare you, I dare you. How's mom? My sister is not your mom, Jackson. She was married to your dad for a month, okay? I'm starting to get the feeling she doesn't want me around anymore, Uncle Jay. Well, uh, that's probably because that's true, all right? You're not one of those people who has an indicator that you've overstayed your welcome. Are you hungry? I'm making a burrito, do you want a burrito? Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Uncle Jay. You're welcome. And clean your tent. It smells like SARS. Thanks for taking me back in, Uncle Jay. Uh huh. I'm gonna buy you another box of Mandao's, I promise. No you're not, Jackson, because that was the last cereal box ever made while my dad still owned Mandao's. Okay? It was priceless. Well don't you get like royalty checks or something, every time somebody buys a box? I meant love priceless not money priceless. Think I'm gonna go with Rick the ghost this year, what do you think? Uncle Jay. Hey, wake up. Come on, Uncle Jay. You're having a nightmare, wake up. What? Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay. Jackson. Wake up. Wake up. Uncle Jay, Uncle Jay, wake up. Hey, Jackson, stop. Snap out of it, snap out of it Uncle Jay. Come on, Jackson, stop! Come on, wake up, hey, wake up... Stop! Are you all right? You okay? Yeah. Looked like you were having a nightmare or somethin'. Good morning. Yeah. You get back to sleep last night? Oh yeah, I sunk right into the floor. How about you? No. I've been having these dreams lately. I'm at the apartment, everything is the same except that the bathroom door has a bright light shining from behind it, but I can't ever, I can't ever open it. Sounds mystical. I saw you waking me up last night. You saw me? Yeah. But from outside of my body. That sounds like you're astral projecting, man. You lucky duck. Astral projecting? Yeah. I saw this movie on it once. This girl would like go to sleep and when she was asleep her spirit would go wherever she wanted. Hm. Died in the end, though. I love this song. It's a classic choice. Yeah, cheap and tasty. I meant your costume. Oh, I like yours too, it's very um, it's current. Thanks. Jackson. Maeve. How do you know the host? I don't. Smelled the cheese plate and came runnin'. How do you know the host? Oh, I've lived inside her since birth. I'm the host. Oh, oh, my God. That's funny. It's a pretty tight party. Yeah, I don't really know like half these people. Yeah, right there. Pose it. Yeah. Jackson, Jackson, come here. Holy moly. Oh, you're bleeding. Yeah, this damn toothpick cut me. Okay, come with me. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, come on, come on. Twist it, yeah, woo! Oh yeah! Research? Guilty pleasure. Oh, that's, that's for my mom. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Yeah, there was an incident, but she's doing better now. I'm actually moving back in with her next week. I'll be her own personal nurse. Hm, well you know, you're a vampire, I'm a vampire, we could just turn her into a vampire. That was really insensitive. Oh, I'm sorry. Seriously. Just kidding. I am really glad you called me, Jay. How long did it take you to astral project? A year? Two years? No, Andy, I just started. You know, I'm not even trying. Is that normal? Oh, this is fucking bullshit. This doesn't make sense. Either this runs in the family or you were chosen for something. Me, chosen? I don't think you were chosen for anything, okay? You would think that that would be reserved for someone who spent most of their life and finances on the cosmic cause. I'm not talking about me, I am talking about others. If it runs in the family, when do I get my abilities? Soon, probably. Soon. Yeah? Well let's make sure that you're actually astraling and not just having a slight out of body experience. Okay, I'll come back here later tonight in astral form. Here, take this. What's this? That will get you into some deep astral travel. It has a few side effects, but don't worry, it's fine. I've been takin' it for years. Ah. Well, thanks man. That's 10 bucks. Dude, we're cousins. Yeah, this is a family discount. Are you okay? I'm fine. Hey, Uncle Jay. What? How do I look? You look like a scrote with a cape. Really? Uh, yeah. Can I talk to you? Yeah. Come here. You let a guest into my bathroom and she pooped. What are we gonna do about that? It's Fer. You know Fer. I love you. No, no, no. No. Jackson said you'd pay me for the last three rides. Well, Jackson was mistaken, Fer. There are 25 other Bum Ride drivers, that you only call me? Well, I told you not to give Jackson your number, so. Look, I'm not leaving without my money, unless you want me to stay. You want me to stay? You know what, I'm not gonna pay you for Bum Rides, but I will pay you to leave. How much is that gonna cost me? 61.79, plus tip. Where is it you even go? Maeve's. Well get her to pay for it then, huh? Happy Halloween. Whose car is that? All right, Fer. I'd really appreciate it if you wait here for me, okay? I'll be right back. Hey, man. How old are you? 33. Okay, well you gotta start paying for your own way and stop using Jay's money, 'cause it makes things really awkward for me, you know? I mean, do you have any concept of like rent or bills or student loans or anything? Student loans? I don't know. Okay, meter's running dude. Oh, okay. Yeah. Hey, Jackson. Yeah? Nice costume. Appreciate it. Aw, shit. Andy. So you can astral project. Doesn't mean you were chosen though. Come here. Wow. That's a lot of energy coming out of there. That's the light I've been seeing, Andy. I think that's what's been giving me my abilities. You know, but I'm not a professional. What do you think? Come on, man, what's going on? What is that? Okay, okay. Well, it could be a portal or you could be channeling the dead. Or it could be a gas leak. I have to go to an astral convention. Do you wanna come? Sure, sure. It's 50 bucks at the door. Okay, 50 bucks? What do they use, astral money? Bitcoin, weirdly enough. Come on, Andy please. Mandao boys, like when we were kids. No, no, no, no. Let's have an adventure. Please? No, no, okay? Why don't you just come and meet me at the convention later? How, I don't even know where it is. You don't have to know where it is, you just have to know someone there, and I'll be there. So you just picture me and you'll project to wherever I am. Andy. Bye. Like the toy? It's all right. Just all right? Again? No, I'm not eating this again. I'll go grocery shopping tomorrow, all right. You can grab a donut if you want. Jay, quit. Guess what Daniel Piller told me today? What did he tell ya? He told me you and mom got divorced three months ago. I don't want you hanging around with Daniel Piller. Kinda stupid name is that anyway? Is it true? Well, I guess I got my answer. What kinda stupid name is Mandao's. Picture me, and you'll project to wherever I am. Yo, what do you want, Jackson? She has a type. It's better this way, Jackson. Jackson. I can't move. Jackson. Jackson, help. My legs. Jackson! Jackson! Fer, Fer, Fer. Fer. I'll see you guys at the apartment. Hey, hey do you see me? Dude, this is awesome. Come on, come on, I gotta show you something, come on. Jay. Dad? Jay. Hello? Yeah, no, yes, hello. Yeah, I still haven't received my royalty checks, I've been on all morning. Jamison Ray Mandao. Raymond Mandao? No, Raymond is my father. Uh huh. He's deceased. He's what? Deceased. What? Deceased! Can you spell it? No, I will not spell it for you. No, you just need to stop sometimes and get rid of the stupid, you know? Then, thank you, that's good, thanks. How was, how was your sleep? I don't wanna talk right now, Uncle Jay. Fine. Maeve's seeing somebody. Well, that's a side effect of breaking up, Jackson. The guys a circle. Boring little circle. And the next time I see him, I'm gonna whip his ass. Well, if you had stayed around a little longer last night you would've had your chance. Yeah, I was astral projecting. Yeah, and I'm gettin' pretty frickin' good at it, man. When you left, there was a guy who came right up to me and he asked me, can you see me? Was he wearing a... Skeleton shirt. Skeleton shirt? Circle boy. Are you trying to say square or? I didn't think people could see you when you astral project. Well, they can't. I'm going over there. Can I get dressed first? Yup, still there. Doesn't that asshole have a job or something? Does anyone in this car have a job, Jackson? I do. Whoa ho, whoa, there she is. Gosh, why is she dressed like that? It's California Jackson, it's fine. Come on, leave her alone. Yeah, I know, it's California, okay? But she's allergic to sunlight. Oh, yeah. Get down, get down. Come on, Uncle Jay. Hey, hey, why does your finger smell like that? My toilet paper ripped. I'm staying with Fer. Stop shocking me. Come on, Uncle Jay. Hey! Probably spooked him and he ran off. That's what I'd do if I was circle. Hm, yeah, I'm sure you would. Come on, don't do that. Don't. I think I... Jackson. I can't see him. I see something there. What, what? There's no one in there. Come on. Come on. All right, Uncle Jay, let's go. Yup, here it is. She always leaves me a key. I don't think that's for you, Jackson. Hey, hey, Jackson. Stop. No. No. No. Hey fella, you in here? We just wanna talk. All right, I'm gonna go this way, you go that way. Let's go. Hey man, I'm Darth. Wait. Relax, I'm cool all right? I just, I'm excited to see you man. Come follow me, I got something to show you. Come on. Uh. Open the door. No. I can't do it. You can't open the door? No. Is this what this has all been about? You want me to open a door? Look, I'm not trying to be shady or anything, all right? I just, you came back here. I think that's pretty indicative of, it just means something. Okay, all right, I'll do it. Now I just. Ah, ah! I need your help. Don't mind if I do. This looks clean. Jesus, woman, it's called an expiration date. A little more. Hey Uncle Jay, I found something kind of interesting. Did you know that Maeve was fired from the blood-bank for stealing blood? Doesn't really sound like her. Do you see him? See who? Him! You all right, Uncle Jay? Don't touch me. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't touch me. Just, maybe could you go in there? I don't wanna go in there. Please. Please. I see him. Do you see him? What are you talking about? No. Where are you going? Wait, you're his uncle? So that kid killed himself in Maeve's garage. I mean, why would he do that? Change it to an AM channel, this guy is starting to piss me off. All right. I don't think you should be talking to it, Uncle Jay. What now? All right, so we gotta try catching my voice using an EVP. What the hell is that? Electronic voice phenomenon, okay? Keep scanning the channels. I gotta focus my energy into the radio. If I'm not mistaken, my voice should come out of the radio. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, go back, go back. Go back, go back. There, there I am. Oh, yes. We're in business. Okay. Yes. All right. Where are you standing? Next to the map. What happened back there, Darth? Huh? Maeve dumped you and you revengicide in her garage? What's your problem, man? I wanna know what your game is man. I'm dead, okay? Maeve killed me last night. But I think I found a loophole. You know that weird feeling you get around Halloween time? Dude that's the veil. The veil between the living and the dead. And it's thinnest around Halloween time. You were astral projecting last night, right? Yeah. I mean, do you do that often or what? I mean, I just started. You know, right I mean... Don't you think it's kinda strange that you started getting your abilities around the time that I was killed? I think our paths were supposed to cross, man. I mean, I'm stuck in this plane, but you're not. If you can somehow astral project back in time and stop me from going to Maeve's, you can bring me back, man. But you'd have to do it before the veil closes on the Day of the Dead. Stop you right there. When is the Day of the Dead? Midnight tonight. Don't listen to him, Uncle Jay. Maeve was just probably trying to protect herself from him. Shut up. No, you shut up. You're idiot. You're an idiot. He's an idiot. No, you're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot, idiot. Idiot. Look, if you can just go back, all right? Go back in time and you can see for yourselves what went down. I can astral project back in time? You are an astrotraveler, okay? With your abilities, you can defy the laws of time and space. You can travel to different dimensions if you wanted to. Well, if you're goin', I'm goin' too. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Yeah, how are you gonna do that, genius? A little trick I picked up in Nam. Oh yeah, well, you weren't in the Army, so. Okay, well, I saw a YouTube video with a veteran, so it's basically the same thing. You're an ass-jacket. Just hold your horses, okay? You ready? I, go away. All right, I, all right. See you on the other side. Wake him up. How am I supposed to do that? How would you do it in the real world? Ow. I guess it didn't work, Uncle Jay. See for yourself. Whoa. Hey. Hey. So how do we go back in time. Right, okay, uh, look. Check it out. All right, let's imagine ourselves wearings wrist watches, okay? It should read October 31st, 9:30 p.m., okay that's around the time everything went down that night, okay? Hey, Darth, how do you know all this stuff? Oh, I took a semester of paranormal sciences. Oh. Yeah. Hey. I know Maeve. Yeah, me too. Yeah, but. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow, let's go. I should've done those things with her. I shoulda taken her dancing. You should've took her to counseling. Happy Halloween. You are everything. Extra large, yeah right. All right. That's like wrapping a grub worm in a tube sock. You're right. Tell me I'm right. You're right. Just three? Yeah, I mean the security at the blood-bank was tight. Look, I was thinking. Think we could just relax tonight, you know? No, that's okay. Wait. But this is wine? I know. This is like shitty boxed wine. I know, it's just the place was covered with security. I was ducking in the shadows over there. I'm getting, I'm gonna get another shipment tomorrow, okay? You're mad. Hey, don't be mad. I'm not. Okay. Sorry man. Come on, man. Yeah. Let's get this over with. I'm sorry, I'll take it slow. It's okay, just go get the tarp. All right. Hasn't changed a bit. I'm ready for you. Turn around. All right. Like this? Yeah. I just want you to know how special this is for me. Oh man. Jackson. Jackson, that's enough. Did you see what you needed to see? Hey. Hey, Jackson. Jackson. Where are you going? Look, Uncle Jay, Darth's dead, all right? Sorry Darth, you're dead. I know Maeve needs to answer for what she did. All right, so I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna sit by her side until the cops show up. You're gonna go over there, share a bottle of wine and wait for the police? Come on, that's stupid. Think! That bitch thinks she's a vampire, Jackson. Fine, okay. At least I look for the goodness in people. I don't push them away when they get too close. No, you stalk them and you force them to be your friends, Jackson. Okay? Maybe I love her. Did you ever think about that? Family, friends. Jackson, if you walk out that door, we are not family anymore. You understand? Bye, Jay. Don't ever leave without telling me, do you understand? Whatever. No, not whatever. We're family. You don't ever leave family behind. What family, Dad? Dad, it's okay, it's okay. Dad. Dad! Jay. Hello? Do you see that? No. Okay, I'm gonna stop taking sleep mix. It's really starting to sink in man. I'm dead. Never gonna be able to eat again. That's fucked up. Gonna miss sushi. Should've never lied to my mom. Told her I was working at the blood-bank, but I was just a delivery guy. It's really hard to keep up a lie like that when you live with your parents, you know? Stupid. If I can go back and just change one thing, I think I woulda been a better son. How long do we have? An hour. Okay, I have an idea. I'm dead. Mm hm, yup. Jackson. Jackson. So we gotta try catching my voice using an EVP. What the hell is that? Electronic voice phenomenon. Okay, keep scanning the channels. I've gotta focus my energy. Ah, this isn't working, I'm just tensing my hand. Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Uncle Jay? Yes, yes, it's Uncle Jay, can you hear me? What? Hey, Uncle Jay? What? Did you call? Okay, sorry. All right, listen to me. It's Jay, it's Jay from the future. I'm talking to you from tomorrow. What? Listen to me, Maeve is in danger, you're gonna have to stop a guy named Darth from entering that house. Who's Darth? I'll tell you on the way. Come on, man, you're gonna have to trust me. I'm your uncle! All right, Uncle Jay, what's the plan, what do I do? When you get there, you're gonna wait for a guy to show up. He's got curly hair, skeleton shirt. You'll know him when you see him. Is he armed? No. Is he trying to hurt Maeve? Yes, yes! Yes he is. Change of plans Fer, we're gonna be making a pick up. Okay. What? Where do we go from here Uncle Jay? Stop squatting on the street and hide behind those bushes. Copy that. All right. What do you want me to do, Uncle Jay, huh? You mean like tough talking? Give some intimidation eyes. No, there's no time for that. All right, we gotta use brute force and get into Fer's car. Okay, I don't know, something sounds wrong about that. I mean, what if I get him down and he like kills me or something. He's not gonna okay, you gotta trust me on this one. All right. Here he comes. All right, get him to Fer's car. Hey man, nice costume. What the hell? Get off me. What the? There ya are, Darth. Is this some kind of joke? Come on, just stop resisting. I just bought this shirt. Who cares, stop resisting. Come on, man. Come on. Whoa, it's a full moon tonight. Aw man, your cape smells. I didn't get to wash it, I'm sorry. Get off me, man, here. What the fuck did I do? Jackson, Jackson. I just tried to do it. What are you doing? Help me get him in the trunk. No, I want nothing to do with this. Come on, I'll pay you. I will pay you. Come on. Come on, man. I need you to stop struggling. I don't have any money. Oh, oh, my God. Wow. Oh, awesome. Come on, come on. What was that? Orthodox? Southpaw. Oh, sweet. What the fuck is going on? I don't know. You don't know? Let me think. What do we do now, Uncle Jay? Get him back to the apartment, and don't let him go until tomorrow night. Come on, go. We're going back to Uncle Jay's, Fer, step on it. Darth? Oh, you sleep through anything, don't you dickhead? It worked. Could you untie me? All right, this is kidnapping. Can you feel that? Stop, yeah I feel it. Wow, you don't remember anything do you? Yeah, I remember everything all right? And I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna sue you so hard when I get outa here. So you don't remember being a ghost? 'Cause you were, you know. Oh, okay buddy. Listen, maybe we could just order you some court ordered psychotherapy or something, you know? Who tied you up, man? Listen to me, do not go to Maeve's okay? She's gonna kill you. All right, she's done it before. Where's Jackson? Blue hair took him over to Maeve's. He's convinced I was gonna kill her or something. Oh, yeah, don't worry about that, I told him you would. What? Yeah. Jackson. Hey, Uncle Jay. What do you see? Oh, it's just Jackson. What, okay man. You're crazy, all right. You're crazy. What was that all about? I'm dead, Uncle Jay. Yeah, I went back to Maeve's and I told her about what we did, why Darth never showed up. She didn't take too kindly to that. She was hungry, Jay. She had hungry eyes. She pulled me in for a hug and that turned into kissing, and that turned into stabbing. Oh, you guys had sex? No, she just started stabbing. As I laid there bleeding out on the floor, she started suckin' the blood out of my stomach. I thought you said Darth was goin' over there to kill her? I didn't know you were gonna go straight back to her, Jackson. This is all my fault. No, everything that's happened is because I'm too blind to see how far gone she is. Don't worry, Uncle Jay, I'm not gonna haunt you here like I did in life. Jackson. You'll always be my family. It's 11:30, I got 30 minutes left, Jackson, come on. Well, I figured if you saved the other guy, you can save me too. Okay, what time were you stabbed? Uh, I really wasn't looking at the time. Come on man, think. I gotta go back to before you were stabbed. It was 11:01 p.m.. All right. Don't forget your sleep mix, Uncle Jay. I'm gonna save you, Jackson, I promise. I believe in you, Uncle Jay. You don't have to wait up for me, Fer. Appreciate all the help. Look, unless I get another fare, I'm staying right here. All right, I got it. 20 minutes? Well that's it for me Radio mites, it's your host Miguel saying what's the point? This job will never play for my student loan. I quit. You hear that Roger, I quit, I quit this. No shit. You're listening to WAC the shit. Come on, come on. Fer, Fer, Fer, it's Jay. Shit! Come on, Maeve, you're taking this vampire thing to a really unhealthy level. Give me that. Stop snooping through my things, get the fuck outa my face. Spill the beans, Maeve, what are you doing with all this blood? I'm drinking it. Yeah, people drink blood, Jackson. Throughout history, it's not that unusual. There's lots of applications. Oh, Maeve. Oh, Maeve. Fer, Jackson's in trouble. You need to help him. I need you to help him. What the hell? I can go outside for long periods of time now, Jackson. Every night I smear it on and the next day I can walk around without getting rashes. That's huge. Do you know how huge that is for me? This is about rashes? No, it's about vitality, it's about my health. No, no you don't need blood, Maeve. Yes I do, and so did my mom. If she had access to clean blood it would've prolonged her life, I just know it. No, it wouldn't have. And what would she think of what you're doing right now? Andy! Andy! Yeah? Andy, help me, I can't move man. I think it's that damn sleep mix. Oh, my God, you're still taking that stuff? Yeah. Well, it expired in 2007, didn't you know that? No, I didn't. Help me. Okay, okay, all right, hold on. Don't move. Are you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Come on then. Sometimes you just need to shake the mortal coil. I need help, Jackson. I need you. Stop where you are. Drop the knife, now. Do I know you from somewhere? I don't, I don't think so. Bitch, drop the knife, now. Don't cross this line. Don't cross this line. Maeve, I got the blood. Crazy bitch. Meave, what are you doing? Why are you stabbing people? Jackson, duck. Holy shit. Should I pull it out? Oh, ah. Dude, stop it. Jackson. Jackson. Look, I don't know what to tell you.

Word got out about what you did last night and it's creating a stir on the other side. Yeah, yeah, people are excited about it? No? Do you trust me? Yeah. Yes, I do. We never leave family behind. Come with me. Okay. Get out! Get out!
