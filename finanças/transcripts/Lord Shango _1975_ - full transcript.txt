That she certainly do. - Well, thank you Brother T, thank you. Billie will get a big kick out of playing with him. - Will you be by the prayer meeting later, Brother Memphis? - Could be, could be. There ain't no call to act that way, Jenny. - I got no mind to entertain murderers in my home. - It was accident. Nobody wanted to kill the boy! - Keep your voice down. Maybe I'll call in and tell 'em I can't come tonight. - Well you do what you wanna do. - Billie loved that boy. - Don't you be lookin' at me like it was my fault. That boy provoked God! And he was struck down by the sword of the heavenly ghost and she didn't need nobody like him no how. - And how do you know what she needs? She's not your child. - Yeah, but I wish she were my child. - Well when you get your child, we'll see what you do. - [Memphis] Yeah, when? - When? When your lord touches me where you say he'll do the most good. - Look, I only said that the baptism might help. - And all we got to show for it is one dead boy that loved my child. Look at me, Memphis. Look at me, Memphis. Am I showing? Is my belly round? - You listen, woman, you ought not mess around with God like that. Now this may be your house, but I'm not gonna stand here and listen as you make mockery in blasting the lord like that. - I am not mocking anything. I only care about my child. [sighing] And hoping one day you'll get yours. - If it's the lord's will. Now he knows how much I want that and how much you want it. He'll answer our prayers. - He better answer soon. - Listen. You go into the bar and go to work. And don't you fret none about Billie. I can skip prayer meeting for one night, Jenny. I'll look after her. - Okay. [upbeat, funky music] [clapping] Come on, big spender, double up this time. Hey girl, get your hand out that man's pockets so he can buy a drink. This is gonna cost you $10 as long as you nursed this one, Mr. Jeremy. [upbeat, funky music] [clapping] - [Man In Hat] One chance for a dollar. - Three screwdrivers, two bourbons watered back.

Most of 'em drink 'cause they can't handle their feelings. - Maybe I drink to see if I can find any feelings. - Jabo. Drink your mind. It ain't like you to let it go. - Why'd you go to Banjoko's funeral? - Banjoko? - Femi Banjoko, his Yoruba name. - I liked the boy. He and Billie... Oh, hell, Jabo, drink your wine. That boy died in an accident. He had no call to come busting into that service. - I tried to tell him. - [Jenny] It's finished. - No. It ain't. How's Billie, Jenny? Is it finished for her, too?

I was overcome, can you just forgive me this one time? I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. - Talk to me! Forget it, stop! - For the son, Jesus Christ sake-- - Forget about his son. You fucked my daughter in my house. On your knees. - Jenny, please, please. - You son of a bitch! Get on your knees! - I didn't mean it, Jenny, I swear I didn't mean it. - [Jenny] On your knees. - Jenny, please! - Bullshit! Bullshit, bullshit! - Don't talk like that, not in here.

All the happiness I ever hoped to see. - But you ain't seen the bill yet. You get three chances to pay the price. - You mean for what happened between Jenny and me? - I mean, the price of life. Like the men say, life and the price. - You talkin' about Femi? Now that was months ago, and I had nothing to do with that. I mean, I even tried to help the boy. - Price of life is sacrifice. [slow tribal percussion music] [train horn blaring] [slow tribal percussion music] [upbeat tribal percussion music] [yelling] [slow tribal percussion music] - Four bourbons, four beers. [soft jazzy music] - Friends of yours? - Business ain't bad enough. Ladies, to your health. - Sister Jenny. Sister Jenny, we need your help. The lord needs your help. - We'll learn how to get along without each other. - And you and brother Memphis, can you two get along without each other? - I speak for myself, Reverend. - We wanna speak for Memphis, Jenny. You ain't seen him these past five or six months. - By choice. [soft jazzy music] - [Man In Glasses] Brother Memphis has suffered enough, Jenny. - Not in my book. - But there's another book, sister. A book that's stood the test of time and trouble. - I don't need no sermon. - Everybody needs a sermon sometimes, daughter. - And I'm not your daughter. I've grown long past the hour of morning dew, so don't preach to me. - When the sheep have strayed away from the flock, it's my duty, as the good lord's shepard, to go out and find 'em. - [Jenny] They ain't in here. - Jenny. Jenny. You shouldn't be so bitter. - Bitter? I'm not bitter. I'm just a sweet thing. Too sweet for sweet Jesus. - [Reverend] In God's name, Jenny. - Hey, girl. Can I get a little wine? - Ike, give me a bottle of wine. [soft jazzy music] You ain't had that much to drink. [soft jazzy music] - I try, Miss Jenny. - They get holy. They forget what they did to Femi. - [Jabo] You didn't. - He meant a lot to Billie. And I liked him. - He liked you. Jenny, how are ya? - Fine. Just fine. - Sure, sure. Your daughter's off somewhere, you don't know where, and your man ain't in your bed when you come home. - Jabo, are you down on me, too? - You know better. - I don't know where I live anymore. - I know what lives in your heart. Woman, I know what lives inside of you. You need help. [upbeat tribal percussion music] - I know where to get help. [upbeat tribal percussion music] [singing in foreign language] [upbeat tribal percussion music and singing] [upbeat tribal percussion music] - Is there anyone who has not yet made an offering to Banjoko Gee? [goat bleating] Is there anyone in our family who has not yet come forward to Bonjoko Gee? [crickets chirping] [goat bleating] You're new in our folds, sister. - No. - Bonjoko Gee cannot hear you. - No. - Then you have nothing to request of Bonjoko Gee. [goat bleating] Bonjoko Gee grows impatient. - Yes. - [Leader] What then? - A child. - Repeat it for Bonjoko Gee to hear. - A child. - Is there one among that might give this sister an offering for Bonjoko Gee? He who so believes this sister's in need of her child. [crickets chirping] [goat bleating] What are we sacrificing, sister? - Sacrificing? I don't know. - Think. - Think hard. [goat bleating] What are we sacrificing, sister? Have you nothing to give, sister? Nothing to give, nothing to give, nothing to give. - Nothing to give? Sister! [crickets chirping] [goat bleating] This is your sacrifice? - Yes. [upbeat tribal percussion music] [spitting] [upbeat tribal percussion music] - Bonjoko Gee. A child has come before you. She brings oil, a ripe yam, a goat. Lonely she is. She is in tears, her child is somewhere unknown. Bonjoko Gee, bring back her child so she may embrace her again.

You are home. My baby's come back home. Oh, it's a miracle, child. A miracle. Let me look at you. - Mama, wait 'til you see Prince, he's grown. - That's not all that's grown. - You hate me now don't you? - Oh, after I prayed for you to come home? After I made sacrifices and everything? - Mama, it's Femi's baby. It was like being with Femi. - I know, child. Believe me, I know. - Mama, what on earth are we gonna do? - Oh, it's gonna be alright. Mama's gonna make it alright. Billie, I know, I know. Don't worry. - We gotta take up an extra collection today for the untimely passing of Brother Davis. [church goers agreeing] God only knows when the time is right to pass on into his loving care. Amen. For it's never grim to be received in his benevolence. Alright. Brother Davis served our merciful Jesus well. [church goers agreeing] And has found his rightful place in the kingdom of heaven, blessed by the beneficent touch of Jesus Almighty.

Billie's pregnant, Jabo. I went through that myself 17 years ago when I got caught with Billie. I don't want that for her. Her child needs a father. - A father needs his child. - Why do I come to you? - 'Cause I know all about life. 'Cause I go on forever. 'Cause it's the price I pay. - I wanna even things out for Billie. All I care about is what's good for her. - You just might wanna figure that you came out ahead. - I could go back to Shango. I went once before. - Sure. But it ain't admission free in that place. - Just one more time. - Ain't no time. [sighing] [upbeat tribal percussion music and singing] [upbeat tribal percussion music and singing] - [Leader] Do you have a sacrifice?

[soft gospel music] How you been? - Billie's back. - I knew she couldn't stay away. - She's pregnant. Very pregnant. - Those things happen. - They just don't happen, Memphis. - What are you talking about, Jenny? - I'm talking about you marrying my Billie. - Don't be ridiculous. How could I? - Oh you're gonna do it, and you're gonna do it quick. That child will not be born without a father. Got that? [upbeat tribal percussion music] [train horn honking] [upbeat tribal percussion music] - Mmm. As Jesus is my witness, you came close to sitting on his right hand. The lord is merciful, yes he is. Look, eat as many of them chicken wings as you can. They've been blessed by the good sisters of this church. - Reverend Slater, I'm worried. - Well you ought to be. You ain't been actin' right lately. And when you ain't right, you always come close to goin' wrong. - But is it right for me to marry a child that's more than twice younger than myself? - It's most righteous that that child has a father for her child. There ain't no doubt about that, Memphis. - Well, even if it was a mistake? - We pay for our mistakes. We're but mortal flesh, vulnerable to the conceits and deceits of our mortality. It's only through righteous atonement that we can seek forgiveness from our precious lord. Oh, how precious. How precious. How precious. - Sacrifice. - Sacrifice? - Yeah. There's this fella named Jabo, he keeps telling me about sacrifice. - Well, he ain't telling you wrong. Didn't our lord offer his only begotten son?

He's taking you home. - It was so strange. - It's your condition, honey. You're in no condition for all that dancing. - No, it was more than that, mama. It was Jabo. - What? - Jabo. I mean it wasn't dancing that took me out. It was Jabo. - It's okay. It's okay. You'll feel better when you get home. - No, mama, I really mean it. It was so strange. It was like being with Femi. His body was so hot. [knocking] [upbeat funky music] - [Memphis] You alright, Billie? [upbeat funky music] - Go on ahead. [upbeat funky music] You're a man of many talents, Jabo. [upbeat funky music] - It's always a struggle when a restless soul tries to enter a body not yet born. - Billie is my child. - If the sickly one survives, the child dies. - Put that bag down on the table please, Jabo. [slow, soft music] Sit down, Jabo. I'll make us something to drink. - Jenny... [slow, soft music] Jenny, no. - That's part of the ritual. An offering to Shango. Jabo, sit down. That is part of it, ain't it? - But you don't know what you're doin'. [slow, soft music] [match lighting] [slow, soft music] [slow, soft music] Jenny, it ain't gonna work. [slow, soft music] You asked me how I got to beat the drums the way I do. Jenny, it was a long time ago outside of New Orleans. They told me I had to go listen. That I would find the heat that surely came from lightening. So I went to hear these dudes play and they smoked, I mean they really smoked. And I knew if I could learn to play like that, nothing could hold me back. Jenny, I could make thunder. But... [slow, soft music] I was ready to give anything. They told me I could play like them if I'd sacrificed the thing I loved the most. And I was too willing. When I beat my way to the top, I found me a woman. We had a baby. And then the time came to pay the price. To pay those heavy dues for the mystery of my gift. And when they came, they came for my baby. I tried to refuse, I tried to run away. I tried to cheat 'em. [slow tribal percussion music] Doctor said it was a pneumonia. But I knew better. They took 'em both. My wife, my child. Jenny, I paid the full price. Took away my feeling. I'm numb. No, I'm dead. There isn't anything I can do for a woman. [slow tribal percussion music] That was Shango's price. - Eat, my lord. [slow tribal percussion music] [upbeat tribal percussion music] [slow, tense acoustic music] [slow, tense acoustic music] [soft, funky music] [upbeat, funky music] - Femi. You left me so soon. What am I going to do? I feel you. Femi, I feel you. You trying to tell me something? So make it stronger. Femi, make it stronger. For me. Please, for me. Please. [slow, soft music] Femi Banjoko. Show me a sign. Femi, I need you. - This is all I have left of my family. - Our baby needs you. Mama says our baby needs a father. I've got to know before morning. Memphis will be waiting in the morning. I've got to marry Memphis, Femi. I can't make it without you. Femi. Femi. What am I gonna do?

The wick that strikes the earth with resounding forces commands Femi Banjoko Gee to hear this child. [lightening striking] [upbeat tribal percussion music] [lightening striking] [upbeat tribal percussion music] - Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together this man and this woman. Into this holy estate, these two persons present now come to be joined. If any man show just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together, let him now speak, or forever hold his peace. It is charged to you both that he shall answer before the dreadful day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. That if either of you know of any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it. Will thou Memphis take this woman to by thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holiest state of matrimony? - I will. - Will thou, Billie, take this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holiest state of matrimony? - I Will... Not! The answer is no. Never! - The baby. [upbeat tribal percussion music] - [Woman] Help her Jesus. - Daughter, daughter, please. - I'm not your child! Stay back! - Billie. - Brethren, sisters. Our beloved daughter hath been consumed by some evilness which requires our patience to humble. - I'm not evil. - [Reverend] Who are you then? - He who sought the path of ancestral wisdom. - There is but one righteous path. - And my lord has lit it with his thunder. - It is the glorious God who maketh the thunder. - Shango! The weight that strikes the ground with a resounding force. - You. - Me. The one who drowned on your path to righteousness. - [Reverend] Why have you entered this beloved child? - To reveal her rightful lover. - May God have mercy on your wandering soul. You will leave here this minute and return to your rightful place in the realm of everlasting darkness. - You command no power over me that I'm forced to obey. - Through the voice of the lord which divided the flames of fire, I will drive you out and banish you to unreturnable seas! - I am not afraid of your powers. I am bound by my love with the strength of Shango. - Sing praises unto the lord. - I will never let go. ♪ Oh lord ♪ Praise him, our lord - For the lord shall give strength unto his people. The lord is my strength. He is the wholesome strength that we've warranted. The lord is my life and my salvation. Who then, shall I fear? I have hated the congregation of the wicked and will not sit around the gospel. Indeed my lord, I have put my trust with you. That the ungodly be quick to confusion and put to silence in the grave. Let them be scattered as dust before the rail. Angel of the lord, awake. [upbeat gospel music] [upbeat tribal music] Avenge thyself. My god and my lord. Flee her. Brother, have you testimony to bear? Or is this just one more profane intrusion on the house of the lord? - I've come for the bundle that is housed in this sister's body. - And who are you? - Shango. [heavy breathing] [slow tribal percussion music] Are you ready to go? - No. No! Not yet! - It is time. I promise you, nothing has been lost. Nothing has been lost. Nothing has been lost. [heavy breathing] You can go on with your wedding now. - Jabo, hey, Jabo wait. - Shango. I am called Shango. - Listen, I don't care nothin' about that-- - [Jabo] Shango. - Okay, okay. - [Jabo] Say it. - Shango. But look, I had nothin' to do with that boy's death. - Is this a confession? - No. - Then why are you telling me? - Hey, look, I don't owe you no confession. - Don't you? - It was an accident, that's all. - And your life has been spared twice by somebody else's blood. - Hey, why are you tormenting me? What do you want for my life? - I wouldn't worry about it. Your debt will soon be paid. - It's ungodly. You hear? Ungodly. - There is godliness in every sacrifice. And you have one more chance to pay the price. One! - I don't owe you nothin'. Nothin'! You hear me? Not one blessed thing, not one blessed thing! [birds chirping] Crying, tossing and turning all night long. I'm worried, Jenny. - Nothing wrong with her I can't fix. - Suppose she drops the baby, huh? Jenny, she might need a doctor. - Memphis, I know about these things. [Billie groaning] [slow tribal percussion music] - Femi? Femi? [crying] I need you. Femi. [crying] [slow, tense music] Femi? Femi. - Easy. Take it easy. I'm here with you now. - Femi, don't leave me. - [Femi] I can't stay too long, I'm going to Nap Town. - Don't leave me. Femi. I can't bear it if you leave me again. - I've come to take you with me. - To Nap Town? - [Femi] Yes. - Is it far? - Too far to come back. - What's it's like in Nap Town? - There's music and singing, dancing. - Femi? What about the baby? - Don't worry. [slow music] [heavy breathing] [upbeat tribal percussion music] [drilling] [upbeat tribal percussion music] - [Man] Memphis, look out! - [Memphis] Oh my god.
