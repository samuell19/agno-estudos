In 1945, the Red Army liberated Czechoslovakia. The very same army invaded the country in 1968. And so began the "Normalization" period. Slow down. Miss! Hey beautiful! Come on, we'll give you a ride! We can go to the restaurant or wherever you want. Don't be scared, we're soldiers! Come on, hop in, we'll go for a spin! She's too shy. Let's go. You lost. I told you so, didn't I? You lost, Fučík. He's a real tough guy this Fučík. Tough as nails. You probably don't see it, but you're all alone now. You're nothing. You don't exist. So stop pretending to be a hero and sign it. I pledge to you, Adolf Hitler, Leader and Chancellor of the German Empire, my loyalty and courage... He's a real tough guy. - I pledge to you and your chosen ones... - Tough as nails. ... to remain loyal until death, so help me God. I pledge to you, Adolf Hitler, Leader and Chancellor of the German Empire, my loyalty and courage. Come on then. Let's go! You may take my life, but we will win! You'll fit right in at the gallows, my friend. Take him away. Let's go then. Let's go! One year I spent, writing the play with them, reserving the leading role for myself. It was at times fun, exhausting, but always, always dramatic. Yet every play must come to an end. Climax, crisis, resolution. The curtain falls. To the people: I loved you all. Be vigilant! Thank you. Gentlemen, I'm really pissed off here. The plot is escalating, the most climactic moment of the whole play, and he squats down instead of Fučík. Can you believe it? What a mess! 30 years I've been in theatre, and I've never seen anything like this. Two months of rehearsals, working our assess off and how does it end? With one giant screw up. I haven't been in theatre as long, but I've seen this happen a lot. So he froze, that happens. Vladimír, I know you mean well, but he didn't just freeze. What was it then? You, the director, are asking what it was? - No, I'm asking what you think it was. - What it was is crystal clear. It was foul play. Sabotage, my friend! Of your production. I see. And do you know what I think, Mr. Sázavský? I think your acting wasn't worth shit today. You're acting is never worth shit. You see, you're a shit actor. - You've really crossed the line. - I'm sorry, I did cross the line. I called you an actor. No, I didn't mean to disrespect the craft. The fact that Petr sometimes surprises us, that makes this production bearable to watch. So I find it funny that you of all people bring this up. You, someone who can't even read the lines on the paper. You, someone who's been the bane of Czech theatre for 30 years! You're the bane of Czech theatre! That's why they sent you here. Why are you being so awful to everyone? Shut your trap, Commie boy. - Now you've gone too far. - I've gone too far? You've gone too far. You're bad mouthing someone who's not even here to stick up for himself. - Behind his back! - Yeah? Badmouthing the poor guy? So where is this guy we're all badmouthing? - Why isn't Petr here with us? - So what if he has to read his lines... - Hello, I'm sorry to... - What are you doing here? You're in the dressing room. - We're actors. You can't tell? - Oh I see. - Get out. - Pardon me. - Who was that? - Some broad. Probably wanted an autograph. If she wanted one I'd give her one. And a little something else too, huh? Good evening, could I please... I'm so sorry for barging into the dressing room like that. I didn't mean to disturb... but would you have a moment? I have a few questions for you. - Alright then. - Thank you. After you. I'm working on a school project... What will it be? - Two glasses of white. -The same. And well, the theme of the project is heroism, or rather, heroism in the theatre. Of course I've seen your previous work... - Here you are. - Thank you. And now you're doing Fučík, so I thought you'd be the right person to ask. If I may... What do you think of heroism? Or, I mean, heroism in the theatre? Why don't you go ask Fučík over there? Well, I wanted to ask you actually. Can I ask you something, Miss...? Milada. What did you think of today's performance? Um... So... Well... - I would start by saying... - How about this: It was a mediocre piece, with mediocre actors, and an even more mediocre director. I don't think you're a mediocre director. Your whole body of work, before this... ...is by no means mediocre. That's all in the past. Let's go dance, shall we? - Come on. - I... alright. - I'm not a very good dancer. - It's very easy. I'll teach you. - So... - That's enough. This is my world now. It changed everyone, not just you. What do you mean? The occupation. Okay... We've done forty shows now and I wanted to tell you that I liked your... ah, that's no good, no good... I was amazed. Amazed, that's good. That's enough... Yes... I've got everything then. Hey man, bye. Bye! Good evening everyone. It doesn't work... I don't want to keep you long. We've done forty shows now and I must say that I was absolutely amazed today at how far we've come. - You've done great work. - If we had a better director then... Well now, it wasn't always easy work. Were there clashes? Oh yes. But it was always about the purpose of this whole thing and what we want to make of it. Our understanding and perception of the theatre. This production is living proof. Who was it, Mayakovsky? Who said true art is born from sweat and blood... Comrade director, I don't want to interrupt... - But it was Stanislavsky. - You see? He knows it. Stanislavsky. From sweat and blood. And I will add that this is doubly true in the theatre. One may think that adapting Julius Fučík is no great feat, but the opposite is true. To transform a national treasure into a living, breathing, contemporary piece requires courage. Almost Fučík level courage. So, dear friends, let's keep our spirits high and if... I'm sorry, it's just, behind you there... Look at that clown. Kraus, what is this? You've completely gone mad. Go and get changed right away. What if someone comes? I'll have a pint. Don't forget - the show for school kids is at 9 in the morning. - The Swineherd. - Funny one aren't you? - Yes, daddy! - Curse him. Zdenka, a double vodka please. Jindřich, I need... You would not believe, comrade director, who we have here today. Young blood. Allow me to introduce the grandniece of Julius Fučík, Miss Milada. Oh my! Well, that's a huge honor, a great honor for our company. - Should I make an announcement? - But, I'm not... It's a pity we didn't know before the show, we could have held a panel. But, I'm not... Unlike you, comrade director, Miss Milada is not partial to public displays. I respect that. But now, with Miss Milada here, we have to deal with this mess? That Kraus is driving me mad. Go and tell him to get changed. - Someone can come in and report us. - Why me? You're the director. - You're the only one he will listen to. - It's only a theatre costume. It is an SS uniform, comrade director. - Especially with Miss Fučíková here... - But my name isn't... You do not appreciate someone parading around in an SS uniform. - We're in the theatre. - But it still makes you uncomfortable. Go over there and tell him to get changed. Go on. - Well, thank you. - Miss Milada, comrade director. They're driving me fucking crazy. Pardon me, I'm just at my wit's end here. Those eyes... There is... I see a certain... I'm sorry, but I'm not so familiar with Julius Fučík's family tree. I mean, your great uncle... I believe he had three siblings, so you must be the granddaughter of Mrs. Marie... - I'm sorry, what? - Well, your grandmother... The amount of stress he's put me under. Zdenka, one more please. I can't believe this. What a sight to behold, am I right? Now Jindřich, he's an exceptional artist and I'm thrilled that he's joined our ensemble, but Kraus! Now that's on Jindřich. He said he would only direct this production if Kraus was in it. A man with his past! He even wanted him to play the lead - Julius Fučík, your great-uncle! - Could you imagine? - What kind of past exactly? Yes, the past... - Well, your grandmother... - No, you were talking about Kraus' past. - Can I have a beer please? - Ah yes, Kraus' past... Ahhh, look who we have here. Vladimír. It's your great-uncle. Vladimír, come here. Allow me to introduce you Vladimír. You wouldn't guess who graced us with their presence. This is Miss Milada, grandniece of Julius Fučík. - He is our Fučík. - I see. - Director! - What is it, Josef? A word please. Please excuse me, Miss Milada. Now show some hospitality, please. - Hey. - Hey. - Fučík's niece, is it? - Grandniece. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Stalin's grandnephew. - Pleasure. - So how did you like the show? Well, it was a mediocre piece with mediocre actors and an even more mediocre director. Show some respect? Respect? Fucking hell. And you're just the picture of righteousness. Before 1968 it was Beckett and now Fučík. You always find your place. You'd even find it under Hitler, right Jindřich? Is this what it's all about? This pure theatre of yours that you never shut up about? "Theatre is the greatest art form today. Here. Now. Every minute will be theatre. We don't need a stage, an audience, nothing. This will be our art. Without borders. All is art." Hey Tonda, everything is art. - Look. Everything is art. - Yeah. Yeah. Theatre has no beginning or end. "We shall make the oppression that has turned us into lousy actors in the hands of lousy directors our greatest weapon! Those who rule over us and put us behind masks do not know that they have also given us freedom - freedom beneath the mask..." What kind of provocation is this? - Does it ring a bell? - No. These are your words. 1964. Manifestos always came easy to you. Are you done? Screw you. - He gave it to you good. - Screw you, Josef, screw you. He should have played Fučík. - That's an actor. - Screw you all! - Hey, leaving already? - You can pour your own drinks. Wait, wait, I thought we'd still share a dance. Come on. You can't turn down Tonda. - Give me a break, will you? - What? - You should be on your way too. - What's everyone's problem today? - What happened to her? - I don't know. I need a shot. Do we have anything here? I have to go to the committee office on Monday. Oh yeah? Do you know what the worst bit is? It's all true. What's true? What Petr said. It's true. I really am the last person you should talk to about heroism. No, wait a minute. You are a hero. To me you are at least. - What you do... your work. - Oh please now. What kind of hero am I? But you are, to me you are. What you do. And not only that... But that you came back. I mean, you were in West Germany, you could have stayed there. You must have had friends there, a career... - A job in Radio Free Europe... - How do you know all this? Wait, I hope you don't think that... How do you know? We get a lot of international newspapers at school, so I read about it in some... - You can't think that I would... - Of course. Anyone could say that, couldn't they? Wait, I really... Do you hold beauty pageants over at the State security? You and your innocent little mug would stand a pretty decent chance. Hello! Open please, my friend! Gasoline, petroleum, my friend. - No, petroleum no. Not here... - Good price. Petroleum. No, no, thank you. We're closed. We're wrapping up here. - Music? - No music, we're closed. Where are you going? - We're closed. Wait. - Music! You can't be here. We're closed. We're closed. Hey hey! Hello. Gasoline. Selling. No need to be afraid. I'm one of you, brother. Friend. Comrade! I want to sell you gasoline. Half the price of what they charge at the gas station. He'd like to sell us some gasoline. It's a very good deal, comrade. - What if we all go in and split the cost? - No way. I'll pay for the vodka, just deduct it from that. And what is it that you do here, huh? We had a performance here. - This is a theatre? - Yes, a theatre. - This is a theatre? - Yes, our theatre. When I was small, my mom took me to the theatre. Moscow. The Bolshoi Theatre. My mom took me... Do you know the Bolshoi? Moscow! When he was small, he used to go to the theatre in Moscow. - Do you know Bolshoi? - The Bolshoi Theatre. Your mother... My mother took me to the Bolshoi Theatre. Bolshoi. Maya Plisetskaya... - You saw Maya Plisetskaya? - You know Maya Plisetskaya? Well I know her... from literature. - Maya Plisetskaya. - Good ballet dancer. - My friend, Moscow! - Moscow, yes. Pour me another! Tell him to leave. Kick him out. Comrade... - What? - Tell him to fuck off. Comrade. Friend. What? What? What? Your gasoline here... Yours, yes? - Theatre. - Theatre. Theatre. Theatre... What do you play here? We put on a show about Julius Fučík. - Who? - Who is Fučík? - Our national hero. - Never heard of him. - Never? - Never. I see. He was imprisoned. Prisoner. By fascists. Prisoner of war? Communist. Yes? A member of the resistance. - Prisoner of war? - No, he wasn't a soldier. No. But in a certain sense, he was... - How to say it? - An informant? Don't speak. Shut up! All good. He was imprisoned. Stalin said there were no prisoners of war. There were no prisoners of war! No prisoners of war. Only traitors. There were no prisoners of war. They were all traitors. Who is the hero? - Who plays the hero, you? - No. No, Fučík, hero. Our hero. - He plays him? - Our hero, yes. You're the hero? You, a hero? Were you on the frontlines? Did you fight? No no, he's not a solider. He's an actor. And how do you want to play a hero, when you weren't on the frontlines? When they come and interrogate you and you rat on everyone, bitch. Him, and him and him! You'd give up your own mother! Hero. To save your own skin. Just hypothetically, if you were interrogated, you'd betray everyone. - Go away and don't provoke him. - This guy's a nut. What do you know about war? I fought. I fought. So many young people, dead. People like you. How many young men perished. Do you know what it's like to burn in a tank? The stench of human flesh. All those young people, dead. It's you we fought for! For you! For peace on earth. We died for peace. What do you know about war? Czechoslovaks. You know nothing. You know nothing. Nothing... Comrade, brother. It's a great honor that you paid us this visit. I want to say that no one, and I speak on behalf of everyone as the director of this theatre... (singing in Russian) The theatre is closed now. I'd like to pay you what we owe... Let's have a drink, kids! Come everyone and let's have a drink! - I'd like to pay! - Come on everyone, we have to. - Everyone here! - Tonda, pour the shots. - Pour. - Come on everyone. Julius. Pour the drink, to the brim. Let's drink. Hey kids! Let's drink. All the way, all the way, to the top. Ooooh! - To Czechoslovaks! - To brotherhood! To Czechoslovaks! - To traitors! - To traitors! Where are you going? Stop. Pour, pour! Pour one for the hero too! No, her. Her! Pour! All the way to the top. More, more, more. - Oh come on, Julius. - I don't want it. Cheers! Are you a hero? Hey hey. Keep pouring. Pour. To the top. For me and for him. Excellent. Here. You know what they say back home? Bottoms up! Bottoms up. Yes! One more, come on. Come on, Julius. Bottoms up. Pour him another. Come on. Cheers. Come on, come on. That's a boy! We wish you... Where's the music? - Where is it? - There. Horrible. He's not going anywhere. Right. I would honestly just kick him out already. Holy shit! Hey kids, why so sad? Come on, let's dance a little. Let's dance a little. What's the matter? - Let's go and dance. - I don't dance. I'll teach you. Come on, my friend. Let's dance. Come on, come on. Enough! What's wrong? I don't mean anyone harm. Little girl, don't be scared of me. I just wanted to show them how to have a good time. In your country, people don't know how to let loose. Do you understand? In your country, you always complain about how bad you have it. You don't have love. How badly I want to go back home, to my women. Do you know what women back home are like? I want you to be gentle. Gentle. Back home, when girls dance, they take off their blouses. Leave her alone! What are you... On your knees. On your knees. On your knees! Come on! Last wishes? I'm sorry but I don't speak Russian. - Last wishes. - I don't understand. Don't understand? And like this understand? And like this understand, hero? - Last wishes. - Please, just leave me alone. - Last wishes. Speak. - Antonín! Tonda! No! Wait! Wait... Wait. What are you doing? Why are you doing this, little girl? Button up your blouse. I was only joking. You don't have to do this. I have a daughter, your age. I was only joking. I was joking. I was joking. One minute! One minute. Fuck! Shit! What's wrong with you, brother? Frische, frische... No. No. You don't have to... Frische, frische... This is the last thing I need now. Who do these occupying scumbags think they are? They think they can come here and act like pigs? They can't get away with this. - Why didn't you help me? - Why should I help you? You're on the same team as them. Don't act like you're offended. We all know your dad welcomed the allied troops with open arms. - Well, here you have them! - Tonda, please... I wonder what kind of role Mr. Fučík here would be playing if it wasn't for his comrade father. Goodbye, I should... No no no. What are you doing? Just like you said. They can't get away with this. We're all witnesses. So no one's going anywhere. Hold on here. What do you plan on doing? - I want to report it. - And who do you want to report it? That's it, of course, to the police. No, no, no. We'll report him to his unit. - They'll know what to do with him. - Of course! They must have some kind of protocol for how to treat civilians. That Russian scum pointed a gun at us. He could have killed someone. He'll go to the court-martial and get put away until he rots. That's right. You are absolutely right. We will just report it, because it... - It has to be reported. - Yeah. So, who's going to do it? That's your responsibility, comrade director. - I'll report it! - Shut your trap. He'd get away with it. His dad would smooth things over... - He's piss drunk. - I'll do it. I barely drank anything. Where's your phone? So we can all go home. In my office. I'll take you there. - That's a good idea. - I'm not so sure about that. Heil Hitler! I have captured the enemy. Shit, you guys took that dance party a bit too far. Oh now please Mr. Kraus, take off that uniform. Stop agitating, we have a serious problem on our hands. Has your Russian gone missing? - You've seen him? - Where is he? I just told you. Are you deaf? Kraus, stop with the shenanigans and take off that uniform! We have to make the call. - He's really pissing me off now. - Wait... Where is he? Must be some kind of conditioned reflex. Like Pavlov's dog. - Kraus! - What are you going on about? Pavlov's dog! No, shoo, go away! Get away from me! Shoo! - Enough. - Hey, hey, hey. - What does that have to do with him? - Pavlovian conditioning. When a Soviet soldier sees this uniform, he loses his shit. It's not my fault. I just revived him in the hallway. He pissed all over our Romeo and Juliet scenery. Then he took a breather after his little dialectical clash with Gottwald. I was scared he stopped breathing so I slapped his face a bit. No, no, no! Don't shoot, please! He begged for mercy, crawling in front of me. He must have thought he was back in the war. What did you do to him, you idiot?! Comrade director, I'm no psychologist, but I believe it's called regression, or delirium tremens. Anyways, he crawled his way over to the boiler room, so I locked him in there. - Soviet scum. - He locked him in? All that talk about "heroes" and the "stench of human flesh"... bullshit. He sees the insignia on a jacket and he shits his pants like a little boy. Aww, was he not nice to you? Whatever happened to brotherhood? How can we report it now? - We can't. - And why not? - If he tells them about the uniform... - Hold on. - How would you care to explain it? - We're in the theatre. He could have bumped into Caesar or Schwanda the Bagpiper. - Just tell them the truth. - I'd be a bit careful with the truth. What do you suggest? That we waltz in there and say that out of love for the theatre we walk around wearing SS uniforms, heiling, when who but a Soviet officer walks in and pisses on our set? - Who knows what he remembers. - What if he remembers? - Then we're all fucked. - He'll turn the whole thing against us. Who are they going to believe? Us or an officer of the Red Army? I know - we'll tell him it was a joke. He'll understand. He himself said it was a joke! He clearly has a sense of humor. Now this, this is a solution. We could tell him that it was just a joke. - Exactly. - We'll just explain it to him. Or... But who's going to tell him? If she found the right words... With feeling... I think he'd listen to her. You're joking, right? Wait, wait, wait... Hold this. I have an idea. I have an idea. If I understand this correctly, we've got ourselves a Russian here and we need to get rid of him. Get up! Get up! Get up, get up, get up! Get up! Get up, you scum! Where am I? You don't have to do this... You don't have to do this. Please, you don't have to do this. - You don't have to... - I don't understand. Where am I? What do you want? Who are you? No, no... Nein. Please. Please... Who are you? I don't understand. Now listen to me carefully. You have about... five? - Five? - Five. - Five. -No. - I don't understand. - Five? One, two, three, four, five minutes left to live. Don't shoot! Please. Swine! Frische frische friiii. You have only five minutes left to live. - I beg you... - And then, a heroic death. - I don't understand. - You will fall for your nation. - Don't do it. - Like a brave Soviet soldier. - No! - Do you understand? - Do you understand? - No! No! I have a wife and kids. Please, don't do it. Please, don't do it! Please! Please! I'll do anything you ask. Don't do it! I'll do anything. - Anything. - Really, anything? Yes, yes... Well, there is one more option here. I pledge to you, Adolf Hitler, Leader and Chancellor of the German Empire, my loyalty and courage. I pledge to you and your chosen ones, to remain loyal until death. - So help me God. - So help me. Your signature, please. I don't understand. What is this? - A loyalty oath to Hitler and the Reich. - That's forbidden. - Sign it. -I can't. Your choice. - I don't understand. - Sign it. That's forbidden. Thank you. Thank you. Good boy, good boy, good boy. Now get out of here and don't even think about setting foot in here again. - What? - What? Do you want to go home? Go. Go... We... We have to... We have to... All of this... rationally... We have to. I'm going to go now and report all of it to the authorities. And it's all his fault! All of it! You idiot! If you had taken off that uniform none of this would have happened. And Jindřich, you're just as guilty. Don't think I'm going to keep coddling you. I've had it! It's over. The jig is up. Why don't you tell them? Why don't you tell them why you brought in this idiot. This human waste, this loser! Why don't you tell them that you've come here to battle your own demons... - Be quiet. - You've let yourself down. What are you getting at here? What do you want to hear? I didn't stand up for him so they kicked him out of the faculty. It's happened to many of us and it'll keep happening. I signed it, so what? I chickened out. Just like you, you all chickened out too. So don't try and pin the blame on me here, okay? Don't even try. You of all people, comrade director. I'd really love to know all the things you've signed. How many people do you have on your conscience? Or you? That State security beauty queen over there. How many people do you have on your conscience? Don't even try me. - Fuck off with this vetting. - Look, I'm going to go report it. - No one's reporting anything. - Let me finish, Kraus! Shut up, Kraus and let me finish! Let me finish! It has to be presented right... it has to... A stranger got into the building and started snooping around. - A Russian soldier. - That was no Russian soldier. It wasn't a Russian soldier! It was a stranger. He was hanging around here after the show. That makes sense. Yeah, he was loitering. And then a Russian soldier came in afterwards and had a drink with us. Then he went to the bathroom... and we found him there and... Yes that's good. So the Russian soldier goes downstairs, looking for the bathroom because he has to pee. That's it. That's when he bumps into our guy. Guy - no, criminal. A repeat offender. Yes, that's good. So he attacks him. But the soldier thinks it's someone from the theatre. He thinks it's the sound technician or some actor. So he attacks him. But because this is a Russian soldier, trained in combat, he overpowers him and pushes him up against a metal locker with a canister on top of it. The canister tips over and the gasoline spills on to the solider. He's disoriented, and so the stranger takes a metal rod and bam. Kills him. And we're already running down the stairs, because we heard all the noise. We see the dead Russian and the guy getting away through the door. There could be a black glove on the corpse bearing the words: I did it. Definitely not Antonín, Jindřich, Petr, the girl, Vladimír or our comrade here. Oh yeah, that's great. That's a life sentence. - The rope. - For all of us. For all of us? What do you mean for all of us? - He did it! He did! - I'll confess. I'll confess. That's true, we're innocent. This is between him and the Russian. And we can all testify to that, that we're all innocent and he has to take full responsibility for his actions because this is all his fault. - He's the one that did it. - He did it. And Vladimír will get away with it because his family, well, his dad, he's high up, right? So they'll just sweep it under the rug and it won't be so bad. So that's it, we can make the call. How can you blame him for all of this? You beat the man too, didn't you? - That was only pretend. - Only pretend? That's bullshit. - It was only pretend. - Only pretend? That's bullshit! - We wanted to punish him! - Punish him? We wanted to punish him, scare him, you dumb bitch! Not kill him! - And who doused him in gasoline, huh? - What are you talking about? - Leave her alone, you fat asshole! - What are you doing? - I'm pushing you, idiot. - Yeah? - You're pushing me. - Yeah I am, asshole. - Not by the hair... - Get off me, you idiot! Fat pig! We're not reporting squat. You think that some stupid testimony will be enough? That they won't investigate? This isn't a play, you idiot. You think they won't collect fingerprints? You think they won't? That they won't wonder who doused him in gasoline? Vladimír? Not very likely. Not very fucking likely. But that doesn't matter because Vladimír's daddy will get him out of it anyway, won't he? Easy. He'll just pin the blame on us. And when I say us, I mean you and me. These comrades here will weasel their way out somehow, but not us. Tonda, don't listen to him. He's an idiot. He wants to save his own skin and throw us under the bus. He wants to pin this whole thing on us. - Don't listen to him. - Shut up! Tonda, get a hold of yourself. We're not reporting anything. What if we just got rid of him somehow? Toss the body somewhere. Out of town. - Like he got run over by a car? - Like he got hit by a car. - Like he was drunk and got hit by a car. - Right, and then it took off. - No, it just stayed right there. - Or it stayed there. No, it left. That's good. Let's go get him. Let's go get the Russian. Russians. Fuck. The Russians are here. - Those are Russians. - What? They are coming to look for him. What are we going to do? - Russians? - The Russians are here! - What are we going to do? - Fuck. - Tonda. - What are you doing? Is there anyone? Come on, open up! - What are you doing? - Don't go anywhere. Wait here. Is our commanding officer here? What? Have you seen our CO? - What? - CO. Russian CO. Our commanding officer. We're looking for him. Fellas, what are you doing here? Shit, you came for my birthday! It's my birthday, do you understand? I love Russian soldiers. I love Red Army. Russian soldiers. Come, come. Come! No, no. We're looking for our CO. - Our commanding officer. - I know... You're upset because I didn't give you a proper warm welcome. I get it. But I'll make it right, ok? Do you know how Comrade Brezhnev and Comrade Husák greet each other at the airport? - They have to kiss. - Okay, okay. We just... I understand, it's not the same. We have to do it, yeah? I'll be Comrade Brezhnev. Hello, Comrade Husák. No. We just need to find our CO. And do you have Husáková? - Come on, let's go. - Hello! Hello Comrade Štrougal. Fellas, where are you going? Vodka! I've got an aeroflot full of it! I came all the way from Moscow just for you! They're looking for him everywhere. We can't leave with the body. So what now? Well, then I'll go to the authorities and report it. We all have to confess. We can't report it now. The patrol already came here, we won't get away with it. - We're all in it now. - So what are we going to do then? - What's wrong with him? - Water, I need... Again. He needs water, he needs water... - Call an ambulance! - Have you lost your mind? - He'll be fine. - What kind of people are you? Jesus, you want another dead body on your hands? He needs a doctor! - You're going to drown me. - Wait, put your head up. - Do you hear that? - Monsters. At least we know where we stand, who our real friends are. I loved all of them dearly. You know, I did everything for the theatre, for art. But alright, if that's what they want. I'm leaving with a clear conscience. - I guess it's my destiny. I'm dying... - No, no. You're not dying... I'm dying in my home. In the theatre. I've devoted my whole life to it. Please, Miss Milada... I want my ashes scattered on the stage. - Excuse me? - Scattered. That's where I belong. Where my heart belongs. My friends... What are we going to do? - My friends... - I killed him. Chop him up, burn him, toss the rest to the pigs. - I killed him! - What pigs? - Where are you going to get pigs? - From the prop room? I killed a human being. - I'm going to kill myself! - Shut up. I'm going to kill myself! I'm going to kill myself! - I killed him. - Stop messing around. I killed someone. Put it down! Put it down! Stop. I killed someone. No. You didn't kill anyone. You didn't kill a person. There is no dead person here, understand? No dead person. None! It's an occupier. Occupying scum. A dead, occupying bitch. Is that clear? Yes. An occupier. From a higher, ethical standpoint, the murder of a tyrant is no crime. A person didn't die here. A tyrant was executed. You did not kill a person, do you understand? You neutralized the enemy. So stop your whining! You're a hero, after all! Yes. A hero. A hero! Our crucial mistake was that we never defended ourselves! Crucial mistake. Munich - total failure. 1968 - total failure. We're nothing but shit at the bottom of history's shoe! Cowardice is our national treasure, cowardice passed on from generation to generation, taught at our schools and performed on our stages. Well it ends today! What happened here today was no murder. It was revenge! A historic moment. A moment in which we finally grabbed the reins of history! So let me get this straight, what exactly are you proposing? Resistance. Resistance? You? - Resistance? - Yeah. Revenge for our fucked up lives. We're rotting alive here. Just look at what we've become. All of us. Look, I don't care how big my jail cell is, but maybe I'd rather sit in a tiny one with four walls feeling like I've done something, that at least once in my life I did the right thing! - Resistance! - Systematic resistance! Palach is not enough. Burning alive in protest is not enough. We cannot kill ourselves, do you hear? - We have to kill them. Them! - Yes! - Resistance! - Yes! Systematic resistance. We'll go after all the traitors, accomplices, collaborators. Like the RAF - no mercy. Resistance! - Resistance! - Resistance! Resistance! Resistance, resistance, resistance! Resistance, resistance, resistance! It's going to be a resistance the world has never known. - No mercy! Resistance! - No mercy! Resistance! We have to stop them. You have to report it. You're the only innocent one. I have connections. I will testify that you had nothing to do with it. You will testify that nothing happened. Go! No! No! Let me go. Don't touch me! No, no! Let me out! What are you doing? I'm protesting. I'm protesting. Are you with us or are you against us? I think, friends, that we could... there's still the... we could maybe... but if you think that... With us, or against us? With you, of course. I'm with you. To the editors at Free Europe in Munich and all Western media outlets: This morning, Russian officer Boris Bjelajev was executed as an act of revenge for the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact troops. Passive resistance has proved ineffective, and so we have adapted a more offensive strategy. The execution of Major Bjelajev was just a drop in the bucket. Our first torch! We are ordinary citizens of the state. We are everywhere and also nowhere. The subjugation and oppression that has turned us into lousy actors in the hands of lousy directors, an anonymous herd of obedient sheep, will now become our greatest weapon. Those who rule over us today have forgotten that the masks they have given us have also given us newfound freedom. Freedom beneath the mask. Resistance! Retribution for years of humiliation by any means necessary. Cruelty is no exception. Abductions, executions, terrorist attacks, systematic extermination of our enemy's allies, families and friends. Shielded by the anonymity of everyday life, we shall sow the seeds of destruction. - Yes, death to all traitors! - Resistance! - Death to all occupiers! - Resistance! - Resistance! - Resistance! Resis... Do you have a cigarette? No. Nein. I mean... Niet.
