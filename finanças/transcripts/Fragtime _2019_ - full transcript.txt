If... for only 3 minutes... you could stop the time... What... would you do? Moritani-san... Come on, you weren't listening? S... sorry, I... I've only seen short stories from this author so far. Is... is that so? I was thinking of reading the first volume! Can you recommend me, Moritani-san? Uh... uhm... that's... Uhm... That's... That's just a momentary dream. H... how... can you move? What is eternity? The time stopped. It was you, Moritani-san? And then I was caught... What... did you... I mean, how can you move, Murakami-san? Can you stop the time as much as you want? F... for about 3 minutes. 3 minutes, huh... It's short, isn't it? You stopped the time to look at my underwear, right? You are such a pervert. It... it's... it's not like that! I... I should tell everyone... That the ordinary, quiet and shy Moritani-san... Even though she's a girl... she's a pervert who wants to see other girls' panties. No, please! I will do anything! Murakami-san... Anything? is that kind of a person? You will do anything? She was mean... however... but... she made my heart beat faster. What should I ask from you, Moritani-san... I'll let you know tomorrow! [I'll let you know tomorrow] She'll let me know... What the hell... are they talking about? Moritani-san, good morning! Ah, sorry! Ah, g... good morning... What's wrong? N... nothing! So, Moritani-san, you haven't joined any club yet, right? No... What about the table tennis club? We don't have too many members... What about... But I'm already in second year... Don't worry, it doesn't matter! We are relatively loose, so you can join midway! If it's okay, let's go to the clubroom after school! Come on... Why does she talk to me every day? So- Huuuh... You stopped it only because of that? Hmm... Are you going to look under girls' skirts? I... I'm not... But you looked at my panties yesterday. But... I haven't seen other people's... M... Murakami-san was the first... Really? R... really! Anyways... The time really has stopped. So it wasn't a dream. I wish it was a dream! Only I can move? I guess. But why I'm the only one who can move? Uh... I don't know. If I knew, I would want Murakami-san's time to stop as well! So you can stop the time, Moritani-san, however I can still move? That's because... Moritani-san, you have a crush on me, aren't you? You want to share time with me. Isn't that the case? In other words... Murakami-san... Moritani-san... you like me, right? I don't understand Murakami-san at all... By the way... Are you free next Sunday? It's been a while since I was hanging out with someone. So where are you going now? Moritani-san! Sorry, did you wait? No, uhm... We are going on a date! D... date!? So delicious! Come on, take a bite! Hum, eat it quickly! Aa, come, come, come! Is it tasty? Is it really good here? Moritani-san, let's go where you want to go Uh... Uhm... M... Murakami-san, I'm fine with where you want to go! Really? Don't be shy! Oh, that girl is so beautiful! Riiight~ I wonder what's she's doing~ I think so too~ I want to stop the time and run away. Aaaah, it would look good on you, Moritani-san! But... This... I'll buy it for you, Moritani-san! Huh!? Unlike with other people... It's the same I wear. Don't you want it? You like watching it, no? No, it's not that I like panties that much! You don't? somehow when I'm with Murakami-san... Ah, I get it! You just like me wearing it! That's not what I... it's fun! Fun? If I had fun spending time with other people... would you... forgive me? Hey, aren't these cute? Yes, they are. Hmm? Our classmate, Tamaki-kun... with a girl from a different class? T... they are close. It seems like they are going out. For how long I wonder... I should have told you sooner... Huh... Can it be that... Murakami-san and Tamaki-kun... We were dating. But it looks like I'm not his girlfriend anymore. Huh!? So... without he telling Murakami-san... with someone else... Wait, wait! Let's go! Huuuuuuh!? But are you sure? I mean if he's going out with you, Murakami-san... Shouldn't you say something back to Tamaki-kun... I never really loved him. He just asked me out and I accepted it. B... but... Your feelings, Murakami-san... Whatever. Murakami-san... Why do you sound like you've given up on everything? There's no way you don't care about your feelings. Moritani-san... The time... Murakami-san! Now no one will see us! Hurry up! Murakami-san may be right... So you can stop the time, Moritani-san, however I can still move... I want to spend my time with Murakami-san... So, in other words... You like me right? In the next few days, I stopped the time every day. Day after day we peaked into our classmates' secrets. Murakami-san knows everyone well. Maybe even too well. Hey, the 3 minutes is over soon. Yeah... Somehow our secret time... makes my heart beat faster. Is that so... I feel the same. Look! Huh... uhm, but... Ah, so soft I wish we had more time... Nice! Go! Haruka! Join our team! Okay! Hee, unfair! Murakami-san, join ours! You already have 3 people from the basketball club. Haruka has the power of 10 others. Unfair... Murakami-san is liked by everyone. Haruka, nice job! Alright, one more- Moritani-san... Huh, what? Why did you stop the time? Uh no, I mean... I stopped the time unconsciously? Murakami-san, you were playing so well... so I wanted to give you a little rest. Hmm, thank you! What was I thinking... Hee, I see... And you can solve it easily like this. I get it now, thank you! As expected from Haruka! Always helping us! So easy to understand! Moritani-san... S... sorry... I stopped it by accident... I see. Murakami-san, not just by me... but liked by everyone. But if time has already stopped, can you help me with this? Alright, which? Oh, this... this... What was I thinking... [Can't have time all to yourself] When I stop time... I shouldn't have Murakami-san, all to myself, but... Haruka, good morning! Good morning! Hey, have you heard that about Tamaki-kun? Huh, what? What? I heard! During a date, in the underwear section, he put on panties. Huuuh, whaat~ Haruka, did you know? I guess I heard... Huuh, there's no way~ What's up, Moritani-san? It wasn't intentional. Wasn't intentional, but... Eh, ah, how weird... Somehow it's unstable lately... Surely unstable, however... Why are you lying? You're just jealous, and want to talk more with me. That's not true! I'm... not jealous. It really is a coincidence. Really? Moritani-san... Yes? If you do it on purpose... you should stop it. "You should stop it" Murakami-san's words... kept repeating in my head. Surely... Murakami-san got fed up with me... The thought of it... is scary. Without any solution a few days have passed... Teacher, my stomach hurts. What... am I doing? I'm an idiot. There's a girl's sleeping, so be quiet. Okay! You haven't stopped time recently. Why? Because, Murakami-san... You said I should stop... Murakami-san... I didn't want you to hate me... So you blame me? It's not like that! You need to figure out what you would like to do... What... I want... Yup. I can't. Why? You'd hate me if I said it! Hate you... Then no one will ever know your true feelings, Moritani-san. Huh!? Next class is about to start. If you are feeling well, you should return- You can stop the time for about 3 minutes with your power, right? Yeah. Now... if I kiss you, Moritani-san... and the time starts again... we'll be seen by her. That's fine by me... to kiss you, Moritani-san, even if someone sees us. If you are feeling well, you should return to the classroom. Okay! [English pop-quiz] Do you want to go out? Going out...? If we are going out, I won't be alone with others besides you, Moritani-san... in exchange... In exchange... In exchange... In exchange... there's something I want to ask from you. Moritani-san, which middle school are you from? Huh? Me? Uhm... well... It's different from our middle school. Uhm, yeah... Minami Middle School... Huuh, not many are from Minami Middle School. Is... is that so... Oh, I could finally test that new lipstick! The strawberry one! Hey Haruka! Do you have the homework for 5th period? Come on, you are relying too much on Haruka... Eh, I'm sorry. It's okay, one second, let me get my book. We are saved! Then, me too~ Everyone!? I can't believe it's that hard to be with people without stopping time... How Murakami-san isn't getting tired? Ahh, come on! My false lashes came off~ You touch your face too much... That girl... was it Moritani-san? Can't she just give a normal answer for once? Yeah~ I'm trying my best to talk with her, but she just sits silently... And what was Haruka thinking? Well, isn't Murakami-san a little kiss-ass? Ah, I know. She's posing for everyone. And flirting with the boys. Just look at our homeroom teacher, that Yamaguchi... Talking about touching... Really!? I mean, she was fine with it... It wasn't even weird for her... I envy her popularity... but flirting with Yamaguchi is really bad. That's what she gets for being a bitch... Ah, it's off. Uhm, I know. Huh, that is so. That's why I thought I can't get along with people. Just showing off without being close... I can't stand it... that you need to pretend to be with others... I've been running away. But someone who can't run away... for example, Murakami-san... She's having it much worse than me... Now then, start! Could you take a photo? A photo? Please, would you watch me? Yeah... I'll watch you, Murakami-san. Come! Do whatever you like! No one's watching... right now. When I touch her, I can feel her heart beating. The perfect honor student, Murakami-san.. wants to sin. Murakami-san... Murakami-san... Murakami-san... Murakami-san... Get dressed! The time is about to start again... Murakami-san looked somewhat disappointed. As if... she wanted to be found out. Will we do the same tomorrow? Murakami-san... Murakami-san... Moritani-san! Huh? Murakami-san!! Uhm, I'm Kobayashi... I... I'm sorry... It's okay. Moritani-san, you are hanging out a lot with Murakami-san lately, are you in the same club? Huh, we aren't... Well then, have you decided since then, if you want to join the table tennis club? Table tennis? I see. She invited me to her club the other day. I'm bad in sports... It's fine, it's fine! It's easier to get into table tennis than other sports! Between you and me, talking about our school... if you are looking for results- Should I stop time and run away again? So if you want to practice swinging- No, I can only stop time for Murakami-san! You listened to me today. Huh? You always disappeared when I was talking to you... I was worried you hate me. S... sorry, it's not like that. Hehe, I'm glad. Let's eat! Moritani-san, is that strawberry milk? Can I get a little? Uh... yeah... Is that an indirect ki- Thank you! That looks delicious! Can I get a bite? Yeah, here. What's that physical contact? Yukari's octopus sausages are cute! Matching today as well Hmm nice isn't it? I want to be your sister too, Kobayashi! It would be hard to make for you! Were the distance between girls always that? What kind of a person she really is? I'm sorry, what? Murakami-san... She has that can't approach me aura. Now that I think about it... I haven't spoken with her properly yet. Moritani-san, you two are really close, right? How did it happen? Ehh, you know, well... I can't say... that it happened by stopping the time and seeing her panties. Maybe it's me... but she looks lonely. Ha~ruka! Ah, I'm sorr- Moritani-san... why did you stop the time? You wanted to talk to me? Or... P... n... you were... Heh? It seemed like you were in pain. Sorry! I just felt like that... Sometimes, I watch you from a distance, Murakami-san... I think maybe you looked a bit tired... Every day you seem so busy... Ah, that reminds me! The other day when I stopped time, I forgot to send you the photo- I don't need it. You can keep that, Moritani-san... to not forget that it really happened. Haruka, when did you move? Huh!? Just now you where here... What do you mean? Let's go! Uh, okay! It really happened... To not forget that... [Career Choice Survey] [Don't forget to turn in!] Moritani-san! Moritani-san! Moritani-san! Go to the infirmary if you aren't feeling well! I... I'm fine... Well then, let's breathe some fresh air! Come, let's go! Huh, ehh... Ahhh... I feel a bit better now. Maybe you just didn't have enough oxygen. What did you write as your plans? Nothing yet... And you, Kobayashi-san? Huh!? Manga artist!? Shhh! Not so loud! S... sorry! Don't tell anyone! Everyone is writing things like getting into a university... but before I search for another job, I really want to take a chance. That's amazing, Kobayashi-san! Ah no, no, it really isn't much. Now I'm writing about table tennis, and there are club activities too, also there is reality. My future plans... But I... I don't even know what will happen today... Isn't that her career survey? Kobayashi-san... Manga artist? No way! Let me see! Huuh, Kobayashi-san is like that? You need to sell to be successful. No university? She won't continue her studies? She has to be dreaming... Moritani-san! Murakami-san, wait! I promised you when we started going out, that I won't hang out alone with people other than Moritani-san. I was being careful, even when I was talking with someone, I was careful to not be just the two of us. But... it seems like I was the only one who wanted to keep our promise. That's not true! Murakami-san... Look! I only think about you, Murakami-san... My underwear... I wanted to wear the same as you! I searched online for the same... Haha, is that so? Matching with mine! After all, we did something bad! But... I saw Murakami-san's happy face. It made me happy. Everything will be alright! 3 minutes... That's mine and Murakami-san's time. I wish that time would go on longer. Without restrictions... I wish it could go on for an eternity. It's almost 3 minutes... the time will... start moving again. That's fine. Look, everything is still stopped! Huh, really... When you stop the time, the flow of it stops as well. So there shouldn't be any restrictions. Woah... Now that you say that, it really is like that. Then, the time can stay stopped for an eternity. Right. Look! Waves, stars, sand, people, everything stays stopped! The clock that's counting the 3 minutes has also stopped! They stopped for an eternity. The eternity... what is it like? Is it lonely? No, if it's with you, Murakami-san! However, in reality... the power to stop the time, is getting weaker and weaker. Little by little, things has begun to scatter. She flashed in the hallway? I can't believe! There's no way, you saw it too? Can it be that Murakami... that Haruka... She must had saw a guy there and flashed for him! No way, she let her guard down? She can do whatever she wants because of her looks. I never really understood her, so I have nothing to do with it! There's a rumor she did it with that homeroom teacher, Yamaguchi. Disgusting. What should I do... I don't know. "On your mark" Thanks for yesterday! Huh? You picked up my career survey. I know it's too hard to be a manga artist. But it's my dream since I was a child. Can I ask something strange? What? This is just an example. What is it? Tell me! Let's say there is an important person, who I can only protect with my power, but that power is going away. A prince, who was paying the medical bills for her sick lover goes bankrupt! Then, what do you do!? It's like that. Huh? Ah, right. They really are similar. So what should he do... The prince should just be honest with his lover. Ah, it was too blunt. Just... maybe the lover only wants the power of the money from- Huh, what!? If it's like that, just break up! She's only after his money!? B... but sometimes she helped him too... Is that so? Was it a misunderstanding? Which is it!? Uhm... The prince is happy when he's with his love, and happy when she laughs. So he wants to be with her. As far as I see they need each other, so it's a mutual love. R... really!? The prince should just talk to her and work it out together, don't you think? That sounded like Murakami-san! Huh!? No, it's not like that! It was just an example! I get it! But I'm happy. I'd never thought you would ask me for advice, Moritani-san. Me too... I never thought I would talk relaxed like this either. Because I spent that time with Murakami-san... Murakami-san, there's something I want to tell you! I don't want to hear. Wait! Murakami-san! I will probably lose my power to stop the time! I can't stop it now like I could before... The time I can stop for is slowly decreasing. So we won't be able to do anything we want anymore. Sorry... Moritani-san, you are in indoor shoes... But, Murakami-san, you started running suddenly... While you can still stop the time... let's make a difference. Together. Aikawa-san made a mistake here! Let me fix it for you. W... won't she find out? Who knows... Aikawa-san isn't too precise, so it's 50-50 whether she notices it. Hmm, while we are at it, "Dozing off in the front seat stands out, be care-" What are you doing!? I wrote to her. Since then, Murakami-san never did anything unusual Wait, who was it!? What, what? There's something weird in my notebook! "With your birthday as password, your boyfriend can log in easily." What's that? I never understood why she's doing these. Undressing in the classroom, leaving notes for others... Right, you knew the correct answer. So, the next question is... He just touched her shoulder. Is that okay for Murakami? You are okay even after flashing your underwear? Born to be a slut. Stop. I don't want to hear. I don't want to know. Dunno. Don't hide it, Tamaki. You were dating Murakami-san. I mean even when we were dating, I had a feeling she never liked me... Moritani-san, what do you think of me? Me, who all of sudden kissed you, flashed her underwear, asked you out, and took off her clothes in the classroom. You've been thinking about those, right, Moritani-san? [Murakami Haruka is a bitch!!] How terrible... I would just do whatever anyone would want from me. "Show me your homework", "teach me that", "bring me that", "go out with me", "change the schedule when something came up". I realized after doing all of these.... that Moritani-san, when I told you to stop the time... you never asked why or what for either. But I get it. No one is interested in the real me. That's right. I don't want to know... Murakami-san's true self. She's a bit mean, but really kind- When you think she's kind, she's suddenly cold- When you think she's cold, then- If I didn't know her... then I couldn't love Murakami-san! I... want to know about Murakami-san! Murakami-san, I... want to visit your house! Did you get here easily? Uhm, yeah, it was alright. Excuse me. Don't be shy. We are alone until night. As for drinks, is black darjeeling tea good? Uh, yeah, thank you. When I'm away, don't go poking around in weird places. When was the last time I visited someone's room? Murakami-san's room has a nice smell. You didn't touch weird places? I didn't. Really? Like my bed. I... I didn't look! I... I came today... because I wanted to talk with you in peace, Murakami-san. Until now, we could only talk properly when I stopped the time... I want to know more about you, Murakami-san... Moritani-san... Come here, come! Moritani-san, do whatever you want! You can. I don't understand. I don't think that's what you want to do with me, Murakami-san... Why are you doing this, Murakami-san... Why... Because this is what you want, Moritani-san. What I... What do you mean? Right? Can it be that... Whatever you want, Moritani-san. Murakami-san... only thinks about what her partner wants. It's scary... I don't want to hear it... but... Murakami-san... why are you going out with me? Can it be that you, Murakami-san... only started going out with me because I wanted to... Sorry, just a minute. My mom came home. She left something. When I'm away, don't go poking around in weird places. Like under the bed... Don't go poking around. This girl likes this. That boy likes that. This girl likes this. [Aikawa Tamayo] That boy likes that. Then, do you have dinner? Yeah, it's fine. Eat properly too, Mom! Yeah, yeah... The name of all students and teachers. On the back, their birthdays, their blood type, what they like, what they hate, what makes them happy. You memorized these for everyone? [Ogawa Yurika] [Ozawa Seiko] That's right. Did you see yours, Moritani-san? [Moritani Misuzu] Moritani Misuzu-san... Always reads books by herself, she's not good at talking with people, but immediately likes those who talk to her kindly. It's not li- She's really curious about people, but doesn't have courage, it doesn't matter who is her partner, as long as she's kind. Only she can make herself stronger. The way to make her excited, is to share secrets with her. Even better, if it's with another girl. Anyone would do. Stop! That's not like me! But the people around me are. To friends and partners... I'm nothing but a tool for them, to show me off and get high on the class hierarchy... No? [Murakami Haruka is a bitch!!] What everyone wants, the kind and sweet, [Murakami Haruka] the never sad, always helping, the one who always listens and does everything others want her to do. That Murakami Haruka. Well then, what will happen to your feelings, Murakami-san? There has to be something that you want, Murakami-san! Let's see. Murakami Haruka Wants to be liked by everyone. Shows a smiling face, no one hates her. And then, well... [Murakami Haruka] then... nothing is left. Let's pretend you saw nothing today! And from tomorrow, our secret love can continue. Murakami-san can't love anyone or anything. Even in those 3 minutes when the time stops, she doesn't know what she wants. Is it okay by Murakami-san? I don't understand. It's not something people like me could understand. No one can truly understand others. So... So, is that okay? I don't understand. But we... holding hands tightly... Therefore... Wa- What's going on? Moritani-san... the time is moving again... You can't run away today, Murakami-san. I, Moritani Misuzu, and Murakami Haruka... we could stop the time and do whatever we wanted to! We scribbled in your notes, we put panties on the cheater Tamaki-kun! And she stripped in the classroom... What are you talking about, Moritani-san? If you say that, then we can't be... We can't? What? Please continue, Murakami-san! Murakami-san! Wait! Please tell me, Murakami-san! You told me, that you put on a smiling face, so everyone would like you. I was telling everyone about how we could do whatever wanted, if you really didn't want them to know, then why didn't you stop me there? You wanted them to know the real side of Murakami-san, you wanted them to see it. You said that the real Murakami Haruka is nothing without others, that there's nothing you want to do! But that's a lie! Shut up. You are incredibly selfish! You just wanted others to find the real you! Shut up! Moritani-san, you think you understand me!? Murakami-san... You don't know me at all, and you want to tell me how to feel? You don't even know me... Haruka-chan, you are a beautiful girl, this suits you well. Thank you, Grandma! I will wear it every day! I don't understand you, but... the me who you wrote in your cards isn't me either, Murakami-san! Huuh!? We are the same, Murakami-san! We both can't understand, but you just play the innocent, while labeling others!? Shut up! Moritani-san too, scared of everyone, so you just run away to your own world! You are afraid of getting hurt! You are the same! You are just hurting yourself! Shut up! You always say you act as others want you to, but in reality it was you who decided to do it! It's not- When you flashed in the hallway, or you stripped in the classroom, you did those because I wanted them!? Lies! You did them because you wanted to and blamed me for them! It's not! It's not, it's not! I... I never wanted to stand out. That's who I wanted to be, a good girl, who is hated by no one. I think so too! If I'm not that girl, no one would like me. I like you. I... never tried to make friends, to avoid getting hated. I shut myself up in my own world and never tried to get out. But you, Murakami-san, have reached out to me, I didn't take responsibility and I was selfish, but... [Midterm test ranking] [2nd - Murakami Haruka] You tried to be a good girl, and you tried to get to know the people around you. with great efforts, you kept up with your circles. Murakami-san, you took it upon yourself. I respect you. Murakami-san, I... love you. Is that so... I... was able to enter your time, Moritani-san... because I wanted to share the time with you, Moritani-san. Even before you did, I already liked you, Moritani-san! I... love you! A few months later... My ability to stop the time has disappeared. Even if it's troublesome sometimes, I can't just stop the time and run away anymore. I started to enter this world, where there are people other than me. I would lie if I said it's always easy. I'm a part of this big world now. Envy others and their envy too, being misunderstood or being hated. Or maybe... they don't really care. But for me... it's okay! Because in this world... there's someone I like. It's always these simple and good-for-nothing things itsumo sou tanjun de kudaranai koto ga kikkake de kizutsukete shimau yo ne, togireteku kaiwa munashii yo They hurt you, aren't they?
