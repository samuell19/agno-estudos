Only about six of us got out. We ran. Went the wrong way. They caught me. Threw me in a hole in the ground. [ Thunder rumbling continues ] Like being buried alive. It was always dark like this. What did you eat? They threw down rotted rice. Sometimes I'd eat spiders. Live ones. Great, big spiders. I'd chase them around in the dark and kill them and eat them. -Gross. -Yeah. They turned me into an animal. You got it a little easier than me, kid, but it all comes down to the same thing. -Like a rat in a trap. -[ Thunder crashing ] You think... maybe they'll get the lights back on pretty soon?

How are you gonna help Charlie if you're a goddamn zombie? [ Thunder crashing ] Listen, maybe I could get in to see your dad. You could? You really think you could? I could change with Herbie, one of the orderlies in the other wing. I could see your dad, tell him you're okay... Well, maybe not tell him, but pass him a note or something. Oh, thank you, thank you. Shit. Maybe you ought a light the damn fires if you can. I told you, it's like letting a wild animal out of a cage. I promised myself I'd never do it again. That man at the airport, those men at the farm, I killed them, I burned them up. Yeah, but the way you told it, it sounded like self-defense. Yes, but that's no excuse. Also sounded like you saved your dad's life. Look, if you do what they want you to do, but only as much as you want to do, it might just be the way for you to get out of here. I'll help anyway I can.
