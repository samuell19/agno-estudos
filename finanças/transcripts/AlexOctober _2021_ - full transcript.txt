You're acting like a child. They're coming for you. Look, there comes one of them now. He'll hear you. Here he comes now. I'm getting out of here. Johnny.

No, I didn't say you dropped your phone in the toilet, but sometimes that's a possibility. (laughs) Well, no, my manager's currently unavailable to assist you at this moment. So, I guess you're fucking stuck with me. I said, I guess you're fucking stuck with me, Dicky. (bells chime) What up, bitches? What the fuck? - What? - You're late, again. Why does it matter? Nobody's here. [Vince] We still have shit to do. Relax, Vince, too much stress results in premature bald-ation. - Bald-ation isn't a word. Put these on the rack. Whatever you say, Mr. Boss-man. Oh my God. Look at her. She's high as fuck. You're one to talk. Are you fucking kidding me? - What? - How stupid do you think I am Dude, you're making a big deal out of nothing.

I can feel you breathing on my neck and it is really grossing me out. So, will you just give me some space, please? Sorry. (keyboard tapping) (eerie music) (camera clicking) Be still. Such an artistic genius. What's that? Quiet. Get some smoke in there. Dude, what up, guys? This is so gonna go in my portfolio. I don't know about that. Get my feet in there. - Okay. - They like feet. What the hell are you guys doing? I've been selling my dirty panties online. What? - Yeah. - Why? Because rich business jerks pay top dollar for used panties. - [October] Seriously? - Yeah. You guys are sick. It's better than selling overpriced t-shirts to hipsters for minimum wage. I like that underwear though, it's cute. Thanks Targe. Dude, you guys. There's somebody on here asking for someone to kill him. Wait, like an assassin? I don't know. I guess. Man, there's a lot of fucked up people in this world. Yeah. This guy's probably the saddest dude in the world. (camera clicking) Wait, are you seriously responding to that guy? Yeah. Aren't you a little bit curious to know who would post something like that? You're disgusting. I'm disgusting? Okay. Hey, dude. Do you mind if I take a bump?

Are you guests at the hotel? Yeah. Okay. Well I just need to see a little identification. Okay? It's up your butt and around the corner. (mocking tone) I need to see some identification. Look, I'm not trying to get fired tonight. There is no room 69, so whatever you guys have been giving her, don't give her anymore. - Sir? - Yes? Do you treat all of your guests this way. Now, that's a very good question and I'm glad we are having this dialogue. The answer is no because most of my guests don't swim in their underwear. Why? Because you like it? Daddy like-y? (group laughs and talks at once) Guys, what? You know what? My daddy owns this hotel, and you're fucking fired when he finds out about you. Hey, hey, Jesus Christ. Ladies, ladies, ladies. Your daddy should have bought you some breath mints. Fuck you! Fuck you! Never fails, Jesus. Ain't you supposed to be at home or something? You know like a wife, kids, uncle, nieces. I don't know.

I've never done anything like this before. - Obviously. - Have you? No. Can I ask you a question? - What? Why are you doing this? Because I can't do it anymore. - Do what? - Any of it? So, why don't you just do it yourself? I've tried. What is this? Just some obituaries. What? Like, you uh, you cut, you cut all these out. Yeah. You wanna see my favorite one? I guess. [October] Read it. Chester McCaffrey, age 83. He served in the US Navy from 1945 to 1949. He was a resident at the North Halstead Retirement Center. He vastly enjoyed banana bread and Miles Davis. He has no known surviving family. That's just sad. Why do you save these? I mean, these people are all dead and their lives are just summed up by a couple of paragraphs. It seems like the least I can do is save them. (clicking noise) Um, I (clicking noise) I should go. - Why? - No, no, no, no. This, this was stupid. Dude. You can't just leave. I'm sorry. Here. Um, this is, this is what I promised you. Dude! (foreboding music) Hey, wait! Where are you going? I've gotta get to a meeting. A meeting? What the hell dude. (cars honking) Hey! Hey! - I'm sorry, but I fucked up. I don't give a shit. You can't just leave. You saw my face. So? So? Are you a cop? - No. I'm not cop. I'm nobody. I'm coming with you. Hey, what? No, no. You are not coming with me. Whatever, you're probably just gonna go rat me out to the cops. - Seriously, go home. Ridiculous. - Screw you. Asshole. (foreboding music continues) What the fuck is this? AA meeting. What's so funny? Dude, what kind of suicidal loser goes to AA? You have to keep it quiet in here. What step are you on? Okay, everyone. Thank you for coming out. I'm Jerry and I'm an alcoholic. (group) Hi, Jerry. I do see a couple of new faces out there today and I wanna welcome you to the group. All right, let's go ahead and open up the floor for discussion. - [Pearl] I'll go first. - [Jerry] Oh, go ahead. Hi. My name is Pearl and I'm an alcoholic. (group) Hi, Pearl. I thank God every day for giving me the strength to overcome my addiction. Before I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart, I was powerless over my sins. Now, I am powerful towards life and- (October laughs) Miss, miss? please don't interrupt. This is a group of unbiased tolerance and understanding. Why are you laughing? It's it's okay. You know, Pearl, just go ahead. I just wanted to thank all of you for your support. Thanks to your help, I'm now a recovering alcoholic for the past eight years. (applause) [October] Woo! [Pearl] I know. A long time. Wow. - Miss, miss. - Way to go, Pearl. I'm Alex, and I'm an alcoholic. (group) Hi, Alex. Okay. So, I have been sober for almost three months and until the other night and I, uh, I started thinking about all the things that I can't control and I fell off the deep end again. I'm a coward. And I drink because I do not want to feel, you know? I, uh I, I drink because I don't want to be alive. [Jerry] M-miss, you, uh, You can't smoke in here, please. Sure thing, Jer. [Jerry] You cannot smoke in here. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Thank you. - Okay, okay. Fuck this group. Fuck you, Jerry. Fuck You. You pathetic fucking loser. I'll be at the bar across the street if anyone wants a drink. [Jerry] Okay. Sometimes, people aren't ready to accept this, but Alex, please continue. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm very sorry. You fucking happy? You fucking serious with this shit? It keeps me going if I need it to. So, what? You're never gonna have a drink again? I'm just trying to get through the fucking day, man. So now, what? Oh my, now, what? You had your fun. So, just go away. What, are you blowing me off? Yes. Yes. Well, fuck, dude. I mean, I thought we could hang out or something. Are you fucking crazy? No, I'm fucking bored. Since you were gonna have me blow your brains out earlier I figured you didn't have any other plans. You were gonna blow my brains out? I'm just saying. You wanna hang out, or what? What's your name? October. - You like pancakes? - What? (footsteps retreating) (upbeat music) This place is a fucking dump. I like it. Yeah. Well it's a shithole. Have the best blueberry pancakes in the whole city. And that sort of thing impresses you? You can't smoke in here. Well, you can't tell me what to do, Daddy. You like that? Do you like when I call you daddy? No. It's just that you can't smoke in restaurants in Chicago anymore. Since when? Well, they passed a law like a long time ago. There's no smoking in here, Miss. You're gonna have to put it away. Sure. Are you ready to order? Yes. We'll take two orders of your blueberry pancakes. And what do you want? Sausage or bacon? Who says I want either, or pancakes for that matter? She'll take the bacon. So what do you do? What do you mean? I mean, what do you do with your life? Like you have a job or something? Well, I was going to art school, but taking a break. - Why? - What does it matter? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to initiate a conversation. I mean, you're the one who suggested we should hang out. I'm taking a break because I feel like it I just gotta figure some shit out. What? You wanna know something else about me? What else do you wanna know? You wanna know my birthday? My Zodiac sign? Maybe favorite sexual position? Oh my geez, could you just please not talk like that? Whatever you want. Daddy. [Alex] Do you do this often? [October] What? Eat blueberry pancakes at shitty diners? [Alex] No meet strange men off the internet. [October] Well, when you put it like that. I'm just curious. I didn't know that people could hire other people off the internet to kill them, so. Well, I was having a bad couple of days. Yeah, well, join the club pal. Why do you wanna die so badly? I have my reasons. What, you just changed your mind? For now. You're like, the biggest psycho I've ever met. Says the girl with the purple hair. - I like my purple hair. - It's a look. It's a good look. [Alex] October, this is bad. Really weird. [October] So what are you doing, now? Do you want some company? [Alex] Why do you want to hang out with me? [October] Look, if you don't want me to hang around, just say so. [Alex] No, it's okay. Here. We're gonna have to get you a heavier coat. Yeah. Thanks. Whoa. So are you a serial killer or? No. Just divorced. How long were you married? I'd rather not talk about it. So, she got everything, huh? I don't need all that stuff around me. Kind of looks like you got robbed. How do you live like this? It suits me. Dude. Holy shit! Oh no. This is for you. (slow guitar music) What is it? It's a prehistoric, mutated lizard. The horns on his face are for self defense. Thanks. Why do you have all these? I saved them for my kids. - You have kids? - Mm-hmm. - How many? - Two. Boys or girls? I have a boy, and I have a girl. What are their names? My son's name is Kyle and my daughter's name is June. She was named after a month, like me. Yep. Do they like you? What kind of question is that? I don't know. Most kids hate their parents. I hated mine. Well, I think June is still on the fence. Kyle will always hate me. Let's go. - So, where are we going? - You ask a lot of questions. Well, I just wanna make sure you're not a murderer or something. No-one's forcing you to come. So, say you're not a murderer. - Seriously? - Yeah. Say it. I'm not a murderer. All right? Was that so hard? (acoustic guitar increases) You have any like, gum or anything? - Holy shit! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Dude, you have a fucking gun. You have a fucking gun. You're a murderer. No, I'm not a murderer. Then. Why are you packing heat? Are you in a gang? Are you in a gang like old dudes that do drive-bys at rival nursing homes and shit? Cute. So, is that how you tried to kill yourself? Oh. Fuck, dude. Yep. [October] How old are you? [Alex] How old do you think I am? [October] I don't know. Like, 50. - Really? - What? I'm 45. No shit, really? What? Why is that so shocking? Just, I don't know. It just sounds old. Well, it is. You don't really look that old. Yes I do. No. I mean, you could pass for like, I don't know, like 35. Thank you. [October] Where, where are we? [Alex] Huh. October, just wait here for a minute. I'll be right back. - What are you doing here? - Hey, could I see June? Alex, I, I can't do this again, okay? You just can't keep showing up here like this. Please? I, I just, just wanna say hello. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. Come on, Sara. What do you expect me to do? Well, just gimme a chance. I've given you a chance. I've given you a million chances. Okay? All right. Look, give her this. - Alex. - Please, Sara, come on. Give it to her. Just, you don't even gotta tell her it's from me. - You have to go. Okay? - Okay. Fuck it. (lighter clicks) Oh no, no. You can't smoke in here. - Why not? - Because I said so. Oh, okay. - I mean it. - Oh, come on, dude. Look, I'm not even bothering you. Oh, hey, asshole. What the fuck? It's a nasty habit. You should quit. You should stop telling me what to do. (tranquil music) [October] Who was that woman? So, what? You're not talking to me now. I don't feel like talking. Was that your wife? - Ex-wife. - What's her name. Fuck! Why do you ask so many goddamn questions? Let me out of the car. - What? - Let me out! No, I'm not gonna let you out on the side of the road. I can find my own way home. Thank you. Will you stop it? You're not getting out. - Well then, let me drive. - Why. Either let me outta the car, or let me drive. (tires screech) Oh my God. What the hell are you doing? Whoa. Driving. Well, you drive like shit. (determined music) Where are we going? I need to take care of something. Come on. - [Alex] What are we doing? Why do you ask so many goddamn questions? - Should I be worried? - Probably. Okay. Aren't you a little bit too old to be hanging out with my 24-year-old daughter. Oh. Leave him alone. He's a friend. Okay. Good to see you too, Mother. So, what is this shit about dropping out? What are you talking about? You got a letter from the Government demanding repayment of the grant they gave you because you didn't complete the semester. What, are you going through my mail? It was addressed to me, as your legal guardian. Don't flatter yourself, Betty. You're not my guardian. Why didn't you tell me you dropped out? I didn't drop out. I'm just taking a break. Well, as far as the United States Government is concerned, you're a dropout! What are you looking for? Savings my sick Grandma Lilly gave me. What the fuck did you do with them? I sold them. You what? I sold them. Those weren't yours to sell. Well, when you write a $300 check of mine in your name, I figure you owe me. God dammit, Betty. I fucking need those. Why, to go and get high? That is not how I raised you. No, you raised me to be a pathetic, fall-down drunk. I just didn't follow- You couldn't hurt me if you tried. What is with you, man? Do you wanna talk about anything? There's nothing to talk about. Yeah. It's really hard to be a parent. What are you actually defending her? No, no, I am not. I'm just, I'm just saying that uh, sometimes it's really, really hard. I mean, as a parent, you're supposed to have all of the answers and most of the time, you're just as clueless as your kids, if not, more. She's not really a parent. She's a crazy lady I was forced to be raised by. She's only happy when I fuck up. That's how my old man was. How so? He just loved to tell me how I was always wrong about everything. He was a big military guy. Thought it was our duty to serve our country. He was pissed off when I didn't join The Army. And then he spent the rest of his life thinking I was a coward. I think I see, he was right. Well, at least you can do something different with your kids. You wanna go to the movies? [Man] Possibly take all the racket. Those, those things smashing through the windows. [Man 2] Well you're her father. If you're stupid enough to go die on that trap, That's your business. However, I am not stupid enough to follow you. It is tough for the kid. That old man is so stupid. Now, get the hell down in the cellar. You can be the boss down there. I'm boss up here. ♪ When the walls are caving in ♪ You know, I want to open this door again. I mean it. Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can- With my help? Let him go, man. His mind is made up. Just let him go. Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never got married or had kids. Yeah, but that kind of thinking doesn't get me anywhere. Can we go somewhere? I wanna show you something. - Where. - It's a surprise. Come on. (guitar music increases) [Alex] Why'd you bring me here? Where I go when I need to cry. What is it about this place? I don't know. I guess that I like that no one can hear me over the sound of the waves crashing and... - And what? - Nothing. It's stupid. I believe we've passed that portion of the evening. I guess it makes me feel better knowing that my tears hit the water and become something bigger. Told you it was stupid. I don't think it's stupid. I think it's actually quite beautiful. Tell me something no-one else knows about you. I uh, tried to kill myself the other night with that gun you found in my car at this exact spot. Are you serious? Kind of hard to believe, huh? What happened? Same thing that always happens. I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger. When I was 14. I um, I swallowed a bottle of pills that I found in my mom's medicine cabinet. You did that? Yeah, I don't know why. I just remember flashes of things. There was an ambulance that came to my house and I remember these coarse fingers holding my mouth open. They pumped my stomach. You dunno why you did that? I don't know. Bored, I guess. You sure do seem to get bored a lot. Yeah. You bored now? I don't know what I am now. (relaxing guitar music) Cold. That's what I am. - You cold? (upbeat dance music) [Alex] What is this? It's a party, dumb-ass. Uh-uh. Nope. I shouldn't be here. Oh, come on, dude. Chill out. It's gonna be fine. No, I, I gotta go to work tomorrow morning. I gotta take off. Relax. Take your coat off. Chill out. Let's have some fun. October! It's my birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Who's, who's that? - It's Alex. Oh! Mwah! You're welcome. - Happy birthday, Stephanie. - Thank you. It's Stephanie's birthday! We'll see you later. Happy birthday, Steph. Yo, what's good? You make it to Coffin's show last night? No, I got a little distracted. My God. He's brilliant since his mom died. So, in my dream, I was like ninja warrior, princess. And I had to, I had to fight to protect my red balloon Because of the whole reality. What's up, man? You came with October, right? [Stephanie] The hardest part, raging. Yo, who's that guy you came with? I don't know. He's just a friend. [Josh] Living out that daddy fantasy for real, huh? I mean? Fuck you guys. What, are you jealous? What the fuck's wrong with you? Nothing. I just, I don't feel like, I don't know. I'm not in it tonight. See you guys later. Where are you going? (dance music builds) So, how'd you and October meet? We just, we just met recently at the record store. Oh, so you're at a party with her now? Yeah, I guess. So, what are your intentions with her? What do you mean? I mean, what do you wanna do to her? Well, I don't intend to do anything to her. Just so you know, I know her. In fact, I know her very well. October can get confused in life sometimes. And what she doesn't need is someone coming in and manipulating her to do things that she doesn't need to be doing, you know? Well, I'm not manipulating her to do anything. And as a friend, maybe you should give her a little more credit. Yeah. I'll do that. - [Alex] Nice to meet you. - Sir. (loud dance music) (dog barking in the distance) Oh my God. Oh, fuck! [October] Oh, what? Oh, fuck! I'm late for work. - So? - I can't be late for work. I'll call you later. Bye. (sad music) Yes, ma'am, and have a great day. Hey, Alex. Could you join me in my office for a minute? (keyboard tapping) (claps hands) So, what's going on? What do you mean? Why you were late today? Oh yeah. I'm sorry about that. What happened? Nothing. I mean, I just overslept. - Overslept. - Yep. Is there something you wanna tell me? - Nope. - You sure? If you got something to say, you should just say it. This is all just very familiar, Alex. What's that, Patrick? You, showing up late to work oversleeping. If you don't remember, we've had this problem before. Hey, uh. Yeah. But today is not like those other times. Yeah. I've heard that before too. I'm sorry. Man, I overslept. These things happen. They seem like they happen to you a lot. Man, you're blowing this thing way out of proportion. I stuck my neck on the line for you before, because you promised me you had your problems under control. You looked at me straight in my face and you told me I wasn't gonna have to deal with this anymore. I was late. It's a one-time thing. I'm not drunk. I haven't been drinking. Yeah. Well, this is how it starts. Next thing I know, you're not showing up to work for days and I got your wife calling me, the police. This is an office, Alex. This is a place of business, and I don't have time for any more excuses. Listen, I know things have been rough since you and Sara separated. I can't even fathom what you had to go through, the devastation of losing a child like that. Kyle was too young to have had to go through any of that. Don't you ever say his name? You know nothing. I'm sorry, Alex. You couldn't even possibly imagine what it feels like to watch your son just wither away. Be powerless to do anything about it. You spare me the fucking pep talk, yeah? Well, despite everything there comes a point when enough is enough. We're gonna have to let you go. No, you can't. You can't fire me. Patrick, I need this job. I'm sorry, Alex. It is outta my hands at this point. Wow. You're a real piece of work. Go Fuck yourself. (Loud metallic bang) Yo. What was your problem last night? Good morning to you too. Why'd you blow us off? I just didn't feel like it last night. You like a straight-edge now? No, I just need a break. - From what? - Everything. So, what do you want? I don't know. Something different. What's so funny. It's just you. You're never satisfied with something. You always want something different. First, you're a photographer, then a painter, then a writer. Tomorrow, you'll probably be a dentist. Fuck you Josh. Sorry I don't have it all figured out Like you do. It must be really nice living off Mommy and Daddy's trust fund. Here. It's for when you change your mind, again. See you around. (anxious music) What are you doing here? Bored. Thought maybe we could do something. I don't have time for this shit. (door opens and slams shut) Hey Alex, Alex! Dude, what's your problem? Alex! Asshole, I'm talking to you - Not now. Go home. What the fuck? Alex, hold on. - Hey! - What the fuck? I said go home. I'm not going anywhere. October, I don't wanna play house with you anymore. What? I'm not your boyfriend and I am definitely not your fucking daddy. So whatever fantasy you got playing in your head is over. So go home. go home. Hey, don't you, don't. What the fuck is wrong with you? The fuck is wrong with you? Next time, pull the fucking trigger. [Bartender] Alex, where the hell you been? [Alex] Ah, I been around. [Bartender] Haven't seen you in a while. We were just talking about you. [Alex] Yep. Can I get a drink? [Bartender] Yeah, sure. What'll it be your, your usual I assume? - Yeah. - All right. [Bartender] (muffled) You alright? (muffled) Yeah, pour the drink. [Josh] Hey, what's up? Thank God. Sweeney, fill me up. I think you've had enough for the night. Well, I'm not paying you for your thinking. So, fill up the glass. I can't do that. Hey, Hey! Tom, time you were going home, Alex. Fill up my fucking glass. Alex, take it fucking easy. Get your fucking hands off me. Get your fucking hands off of me! Let me at least call you a cab. (anxious music) You have kids? Son's name is Kyle. My daughter's name is June. (car horn honking and tires screeching) What you doing here? Are you ever coming back home? (heartbeat increases) I'm always gonna be your daddy. I promise, okay? (loud bang) Watch where you're going, asshole! [Instructor] two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
