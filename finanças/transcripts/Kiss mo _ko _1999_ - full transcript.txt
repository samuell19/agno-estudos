--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website What took you so long? Our call time is 7 AM. We had a hard time waking Calvin up. We're already here, you're so hot-headed. If you want, I'll just take a photo of you. Smile. This is my squad. We're friends since we were children. This is Bishop. The naughty one on our group. - Hi, handsome. - And this is Cynthia, She's always happy especially if there are boys. And this is Clarisse, - She's the artist among us. - Let's wait for James, okay? Okay. - Oh, Clarisse look here. - Can you please stop that? Move that there. So you could see yourself. This is Calvin. The love of my life. Although he doesn't know. No one knows. Gosh. Here's my friend again, staring at Calvin. - Oh hi, Auntie! - Hi, girls! - Hi, Auntie! - Hi, Auntie! Clarisse, you're still here. I already told you to go because your boyfriend is not going to arrive. He went to Cebu to help his daddy! What? Of course. I've been saying this before, split with him. And also, his 'thing' is too small... Ah, legs! And he's not faithful. Hey, Auntie, strike a pose! There. I like that! There. Closer, closer! And this is Auntie Ampy. The hippiest auntie in the world. Wait, Auntie Ampy, will you go with us to the beach? Of course not choco nut! You know what, I'll go to a painter and I'll have a paint job. Auntie, you'll have a paint job and you're wearing only that robe? I will wear this as I go there. Well, when I get there, I will... Auntie, stop that! Change that, change that. - Change that. - Bro, what's the matter with you? Please stop. ♪ I'm hearing this again. ♪ ♪ My heart won't stop beating! ♪ ♪ Always saying ♪ ♪ Can I stay by your side ♪ ♪ Even for just a while... ♪ ♪ Can I? ♪ ♪ Please let me ♪ ♪ Seems like I'm falling ♪ ♪ Once the heart beats ♪ ♪ You have no choice ♪ ♪ but to follow it ♪ ♪ Once the heart beats ♪ ♪ You'll be damned, ♪ ♪ you're surely caught ♪ My gosh! You know those two boys. They are really perverts. You said it. See you later. Hey! So? Who's more perverted? Come here. Hey! Lady Picasso. I thought you're painting? Why are you sulking there? Clarisse, stop thinking about James. He is really annoying. He promised to come but then... Is it right, To have a boyfriend who's a son of a business man, And now that he didn't come, Because he helped with the harvest of their prawns, You will pretend to sulk? You know what, if I were you, you should break up with James. Because he already looks like a prawn. Cynch, not all girls are like you, that every time you see the slightest mistake you'll replace your boyfriend. And also, I love James. What do you mean love? Clarissa, the reason why I go into relationships is to be happy. You know look at you, You're so miserable. Don't you know, you're beginning to look like a duck. You're too much! Can’t you see, Clarisse, The reason why James is taking advantage of you, Is because he's so secure of your love. How about that, you've been together since the sixth grade. Hey, you're too much, It's just since first year high school. You know what, I remembered when I had my first boyfriend, When I was in grade four! Grade two! Hey, it's just puppy love. Clarisse, ever since James became your boyfriend, You became too faithful. You won't even look at other guys. That's why you should make him jealous. So he would feel threatened, and for him to give you time and attention. Just try to look at the shadow of other guys. Or not just their shadows. I know! Let's create an imaginary guy! Imaginary guy? Yes. He should have a good sense of fashion, with a good personality. He should be athletic. He should have strong hands for better... you know. He should be as masculine as Ricky Martin. And as good looking as Leonardo DiCaprio. And he should be an expert in kissing. He should have a name. What's a nice name? Brad, as in Brad Pitt. It's like a comedian on Channel 7. Wait, how about Mark? Mark? It’s kinda gay. How about Mac? It's like an antagonist. Wait, wait. How about this, Aaron? Aaron is okay. Bye, Aaron. What do you mean bye? You're coming with me. - Where? - Come, let's go. Where are we going? His last name should sound like it's for a rich guy. Ayala! Zobel! That's too high profile. Here, here, I thought of something. Uh-huh. It’s so masculine. Mola, it’s like Aaron Mola, the brother of Totoy Mola. It's so delicious! Sis, what's wrong with you? Your mind is so impure! Stop kidding around! How about Nakpil? Like our teacher in Music. Aaron Nakpil. Aaron Na... That’s nice! That's it! Then we have our guy. Aaron Nakpil. Hi, James! Hi! Come, let’s sit. - Ma'am, flowers. - Huh? Really? Who sent these? So, we began our project "make-him-jealous-whatsoever." Clarisse sent herself flowers, chocolates, and love notes. She made it look like she met a new guy. It’s Aaron Nakpil. Who courted her. At first, James tried to act cool. Acting like he wasn’t jealous. But in the end. James! Hello! Who is this? It’s Aaron, why? Who is this? Hey! This is Clarisse's boyfriend, why? I'm Clarisse's boyfriend. So please, bro, stay away from my girlfriend! Or else, I'll beat you up! Try it! I'll beat you up! Hello?! Hello?! I'm so amazing. We got him! He totally fell for it. Hey, then what else happened? What else, he got jealous. Then he promised that he will change. He said that he will be sweeter. And he would also devote more time for me. And you believed him? Stupid. You're too much, Auntie, you never know, James might really change. Foolish girl. You know, men don’t change. They just grow. Sideways or lengthwise. Sometimes, you can't be so sure about what they call lengthwise. You know what, Auntie, you're alright with that. Auntie Ampy! Why? It's true! Auntie Ampy, you know what, you’re so naughty. Wait, what happened to your nude painting session? It's a mess! My gosh, just imagine, there's a bunch of painters in there. My God! They're all gay! Can you imagine girls? They rejected my beauty. My gosh! Don’t remind me about that. I'm just getting agitated. Just wait, I'll play some music. You know what, those gay painters, When I undressed, they all ran! Sorry for them, they missed my body. Come on, we will dance. Look at them. Bishop. Bishop! You’re corny, put that there. Come here, let’s dance. I don't know how. You can do it. Do you think I can do dance? So this is now a disco. Hey, Calvin, dance with Dindi. Nevermind. Come on. Hurry up, Calvin. Is it okay with you? Five, six, seven, eight! Hi, Calvin! Oh, Ruby. Hi! Ah, guys, I want you to meet my new girlfriend. Ruby. Hi, Ruby. Hi. Come, let's dance. Come and join us! - Let's go? - Let's go. Who does she think she is? She would suddenly come and separate Calvin and I. She's so ugly! Her snout is sharp! They don't look good together! Well, well. We need to revise the story. All of a sudden, that Ruby came who wouldn't do anything but to keep following after Calvin. She's shameless! Even though she knew that Calvin is my boyfriend. She kept flirting! Calvin ignored her. He kept dancing with me. Calvin, you're a good kisser! Calvin, huh! I will kill you! Calvin! I will kill you once I get you! Jomar, what is that?! What's up with you two?! Why aren't you dressed up yet? Haven't I told you to get dressed since it's your mommy's death anniversary today? It's because, Daddy... Because of him! He made me kiss the dog! What do you mean me, Dad? It's her. - She imagined that she's kissing Calvin. - Dad! Enough. Enough. Go get changed before you get pissed off at each other. Go on. Calvin! Daddy! Jomar! Dindi, wait. Here are the clothes that you asked me to buy. Thank you. Okay. Hello, Cynch. Oh, where are you now? G2000, I'm here as well. Really? Where, where? I can't see you. Where? Clarissa, I'm here! Hi! Hi! Let’s go to CK. CK? You know well that I'm not fond of signature brands. Surplus shop instead, there are new items! Yuck! Are you okay? I don't buy things from Divisoria. Fine, let's meet here later. Okay then, bye. Bye! Paging Aaron Nakpil please proceed to customer service ground floor. Paging Aaron Nakpil please proceed to customer service ground floor. Excuse me! Excuse me! Let me pass. What's wrong with her? Where is it? Miss. Sorry, miss. Come on, let's go. What's wrong?! Miss, miss, where is that Aaron Nakpil? - Ma'am, he went there. - Where? He is too far, I can’t see him. It's true, girls. Aaron Nakpil really exists. My gosh, Clarisse, maybe you just heard it wrong. No. I even confirmed it at the information. The saleslady might have confirmed it, but what if Aaron Nakpil is already too old? Girls, why are you here at the corner? It’s our last party before the school starts. We should enjoy. Fine, let's have a drink. Wait, I'll get some tequila. - Okay. - Just wait. This Calvin, he doesn't think about anything other than parties. What wrong with you? It's kinda cool. Help yourself. What? Guys, look, he's good looking. Look, he's looking here. - He's so cute. - There you go again. So handsome. Dad, Mom, they will take our pictures. Finish your food. There. There. Oh, wave there. Smile. Smile. Hello. Okay. This is Lilet. Greggy. My mommy and my daddy. The best family in the world! Oh, flattery. You need something, huh? Thank you. What's that? That’s enough, let's drink. Bro, who is that? Excuse me. Ah, it's Maris, Caloy's cousin. Really? Yes. Just ask those two. Just wait. - You're womanizing again, huh. - Thank you. Hi. Hi. I'm Calvin. I'm Maris. I'm looking for Caloy. He's right there. Do you want me to come with you? Okay, thank you. Dindi, why are you sad again? Hey. What do you want? They look good. This is embarrassing. Wow! Dindi, give me a smile! Why are you so grumpy? You're getting ugly. Mallari, Clarisse. Ms. Mallari, are you okay? Sir. You look pale. Are you sick? No, sir. Good. Just a hangover. Heraldo, Pascual? Present, sir. Nakpil, Aaron Vincent? Nakpil, Aaron Vincent? - Nakpil. - Sir! Sir! - Aaron Vincent - Sir! Present, sir. Wow! He's really handsome. And he's so tall. And his body is so good. And when he smiles... You know, this is too much. Just imagine, he's a real person. He exists and he's even your classmate. Oh, Jerry, give us three glasses of iced tea. Actually, you know, he is a sophomore now. But he has a back subject, because you know, that's how varsity players are. You know, almost everything that we described is on him. Hey, so when can we meet him? Why, what’s wrong? What do you mean what's wrong? Cynch, he's mine, okay? We're meant for each other. You know, it's like fate brought us together. And what about your boyfriend, huh? And who's that? It's Arnie. I met him at the party. That's okay, it looks serious. Of course, he's good at kissing. Well then, I'll leave for now. It will be quick, only two hours. Bye. You know, Cynch will never change. What?! You're just breaking up with your girlfriend, but you'll even use me? Come one, Dindi. You're acting like you're not my friend. Why don't you talk to her properly, And break up with her? You know, Dindi. Ruby is a type of woman who you can't talk to properly. Calvin, I don’t want to. I won't fool anyone. I'm also a woman and she's a woman as well. My gosh, Dindi, she's here. Hi! Dindi. I love you, Dindi. I love you. Calvin, what's this?! Ruby? Ruby, let me explain. Sorry! You're shameless! Cheater! Let's break up! And go with that ugly woman! Ruby. Dindi! You’re so great! Why? Huh? Dindi, you know what, thank you so much. Sure. Anything for you. You know what, you're truly the best! Now, I'll be able to court Maris. Hello, Maris. Can I invite you to our school? We have an acquaintance party. Yeah. Oh, okay, okay. Let's just meet there. Okay. Bye-bye. Dindi, you're so great. Thank you! It's like this, bro, right? Sexy. What else? So she passed by, right? I did that! It's because he's handsome. But-- It's because you’re ugly. Right, bro? Do you have a girlfriend, bro? No I don't. He got busted. But this Aaron takes all the girls. He takes all the girls. She's truly a babe. And then? She's okay, bro, right? Truly one of a kind, bro. That's true. There you go again. You keep laughing, bro. Where's our party later? - Where are we gonna party? - I don't know. I'm not yet finished on what I'm doing. Let's bet, that plan will not push through. Oh, sorry. Sorr! Sorry. He'll be damned with Maan. Sorry! Fine, fine. Hi, Aaron. Hi, Maan. Aren’t we going yet? Let's go. Alright. See you! Okay, bro. Let's meet tomorrow. Okay then, bye. Hi, Pola. So it's Miss Maan! Don't come in yet. Sir, don't come in yet. Why? It's Mini. Who's Mini?! Our cat. It's going around. No, it’s okay. Oh, it’s not okay, it's not okay. Because you're too pretty and then cats are going around. It's not good together, right, sir? Right. Just a minute. Mini! Mini! Mi, go away for now. You know what, Pola is really okay. Caring. Gosh! You know, she is really okay. That is why I really love her. Hey! You just don't know how loyal she is to me. She reports to me. That's why you shouldn't do anything stupid. It's your turn for now, Maan. You think you're pretty? You're not! I'm prettier than you. - Sir, it's okay now. - It's okay? - Yes, it's okay. - Good, good. Aw, you're so sexy, ma'am Maan. Thank you. Yes? Oh. Sir, do you want me to serve you food? Don't bother. We'll just have desserts. Okay, alright. Thanks. Okay let's go, Maan. It’s your fault. For you have so many girls. What about me, when can I have a picture there? My gosh! I love you. I love you too. I love you, Dindi. Dindi. Yes, Calvin? Why did you appear all of a sudden? Calvin? Why, what happened? Daddy left us. He went with another woman. He left me and my mom. Calvin idolized his daddy. He would often brag about him that he's so perfect. Perfect husband. Perfect father. That's why when he left them because his mistress got pregnant, He's worse than someone who lost his foothold. He said that it's like he's falling off a cliff. Lilet? Greggy? Lilet? Greggy? Lilet? Greggy? Lilet? Dindi. Dindi, is that your take home for us? That's perfect because we're really starving. We haven't eaten yet. Why? Where's yaya? Yaya's gone. She was scolded by mom. How's your mommy? Lilet? Who's that? It’s Dindi, Mommy. Good morning, Auntie. Dindi, we'll eat this first. Okay. I'll go there later. Okay. Dindi. Calvin. Calvin. I love you. I love you, Maris. I'm not Maris. Where's Maris? Why won't she show up to me? She left me too. Calvin. Me, I'm not gonna leave you. Ma'am. What is this? Happy anniversary. Oh my God. I forgot. It’s okay. It's okay. You only forgot it now. And also, I only remembered it now. See that, when I told you that I will change, I became more thoughtful. Clarisse. Huh? Clarisse, are you okay? Don't tell me you're trying to make me jealous again? You're inventing an imaginary guy again, right? So that I would feel jealous? James, I need to tell you something. What is it? The imaginary guy is real. You broke up with James. Because I feel so guilty. Poor guy. I don’t know. But I had to do it. It will be a lot worse for him if I set his hopes up, right? Can’t you see, girls? There's a purpose as to why James became my boyfriend. If not for him, If he didn't take me for granted, We couldn't have invented an imaginary suitor. And I wouldn't meet Aaron Nakpil. You see, everything is part of a plan. He only needs to know that he is part of that plan. And you will do anything just to be close to him? At least I'm trying to make a way. And that's the right thing to do, Unlike you, Dindi. You're just waiting. What do you mean? Isn't that right, Dindi? That's why, until now, you still don't have a boyfriend. Because you don't want to show any motives towards the person you love. But I don't really have any. Nothing your face. It's obvious that you have. You know what, Dindi, We're not numb. If you would just show some boobs. Let's see if he wouldn't get cross-eyed. You’re too much. Yes, Cynch, that's O.A. Because that really works for me. By the way, how's Calvin? Right, how's your soon to be boyfriend? Huh? What do I know? And why are you asking me? Hi! Can I join? It’s so hard to find a seat here. I mean, it's boring to eat alone, right? Hey, do you want chicken? It's delicious. It’s okay, don't feel embarrassed. There. Lasagna? Is it good? It's delicious. Next time, I'll order that here. What? Do I have charcoal stains on my face? Or do you find me cute? Do you like me? Huh? Because if you like me, forget it, okay? I have a girlfriend. And she is the Miss University last year. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go. - Oh, Aaron. - Your gimmick? Who does he think he is? - His lasagna is not even good. - I just had snacks, when she sat with me. - Is she annoying? - Yeah. It looks like she's really into you. I even told her the truth! I told her that I already have a girlfriend. Why don't you just go along with it? What? She's not my type, bro. Give me one order of that. Let's eat first. - Don't! - Enough! Let's break up! Let's break up! He's outside. I don't know what he's doing. There, my dishes are all good. Oh, are you enjoying here? Hey, you're with another person again? You're too much. Okay then. Just enjoy. Okay. Bye-bye! Bro, toast. Hey, thank you. What's the plan later? - I still don't have one. - Hey, guys. - Bro! - Enjoy. - Drink. - Okay. Cheers. Bro, who are you talking to? It’s Mommy. She's planning to divorce her new husband. I really don't know what to do with them. That's how she is. You know her. Well, you know my mommy. So what, are you okay there? Oh, bro, how are you? Bro, where's Maan? Maan? Bro, Maan and I broke up, okay? So please, let's not talk about her. Just enjoy there. Just drink until you can. Okay. They keep mentioning Maan. I'm sick of that. Bro, you met your match with Maan. You know, it's the first time that happened to me. That a girl broke up with me. Usually, I'm the one who breaks up with a girl. She thought she can treat me with contempt. I can easily replace her. Bro, you're not gonna find a girl like Maan. Beautiful, sexy, smart, famous and also a campus figure. Dude, did you forget? She only became a campus figure as a result of being my girlfriend. And whoever becomes my girlfriend will be the same as Maan. Really? Whoever? Why, who was Maan before? Nerd, low class. If I didn’t brought her in places and I didn't introduce her to my friends, She wouldn't turn out like that. That is why I can replace her with anyone. And will become a campus figure automatically. How about Clarisse? What? You can't? Well, If you're challenging me, I'll accept it, man. Do you know the new girl on our biology class, that mestiza? The cute one? That's good! Bro, of course! On one condition, bro. Wait, just a second. Clarisse! Clarisse. Clarisse, wait. Clarisse. I thought you didn't want to talk to me?! That is the reason why I approached you. I just want to apologize. You want to apologize? After insulting me. What am I, an idiot?! Hey, mister, I have pride. I'm not like the other girls out there. That after playing with them, you can easily get away with your flattery. Take me differently! Even though you’re my type, even though I feel like you’re my destiny, I won't let you treat me like a fool! Oh! Clarisse! Ouch! Are you okay? It hurts! Where? Where? It hurts! It hurts! Maybe I had a sprain. Wait, wait. Come, come. There. Where does it hurt? My foot hurts. - Your foot. - Please give it a massage. It hurts! There. There. The pain will disappear eventually. You're so good in giving massages. There. Is that okay? Yeah, thanks. You okay now? Okay, I'll go ahead. Hey, hey, wait. Where are you going? Ah, ouch! Ouch! Clarisse. It's still painful. Don't force it. I'll bring you to the clinic, okay? Oh, hold this. Calvin? Calvin? Calvin? Lilet, what happened?! He fell off a tree a while ago. What?! Mommy's not here, Calvin's not here, yaya's not here too. Let me see. Let me see. Come, let's bring him to the hospital. Come, Greggy. Ma! Calvin. Greggy. Greggy? He's okay. Mommy, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's my fault. Greggy. Mommy, just a minute. Okay. Dindi, thank you. Thank you so much. What?! You're inviting me to a party? Yup! When?! Next week. The sophomores have a party. Are you free? Of course, I'm free! Good. I mean, yes, I'm free. Well... But... But what? Do you have a party dress? Of course, I have a spotted dress. That's no good. It's required in a rave party to be cool. You know, be hip. Not the spotted one. - Is that so? - Yes. Don’t worry, I have many clothes like that. Really? Okay then, good. See you. Bye. Aaron, wait! Do you have plans tomorrow night? Why? I would like to invite you to a poetry reading. Poetry reading? It’s nice. You'll enjoy it there. Fine, fine. Okay then, I'll see you. - Really? - Take care. Okay. Do you know my resolution? I will not cheat on girls anymore. I will respect them all. I saw on my mommy the effects of my daddy's actions. Mommy is okay now. In fact, she already went to the office. And she told me to thank you. Dindi, you know? If not for you, Something might have happened to my brother. I can never forgive myself if that happens. I'm the eldest, I'm so irresponsible. Don't blame yourself. It was an accident. An accident that can be avoided if I was there to guide them. Dindi, I want to tell you something. What is it? But don't tell our friends. What is it? Oh my God, he's going to confess to me! He will tell me that he sees me as more than a friend. Dindi. Calvin. On our squad, you're my ultimate bestfriend. A song for a man from Kiamba. It becomes a mark between two shores. The dust that came from your childhood. Just like your test. As a small child. Among the guava and acacia. That you once enshrined upon the coming of the feast. For you wanted to be a coachman. That rushes through its highest branch. Just like your estranged wife. That sometimes yawns at watching the window every time your desires blaze. At the cradle of honeys without pages. Because of this What's wrong with you? Be ashamed of what you're doing. Why?! What do you mean why?! If Clarisse sees you, you'll be dead. The absurdity that you weaved. This is for you, madam. It's so good, right? So deep. You know, like it's talking to your soul. - Yes. - My gosh, I got bored. Of course, you don't have a soul. What do you mean I don’t? Can't you see, it's already quite revealed, right? Show some restraint towards my visitor. Hey, forgive my friends. Come, I will introduce you to my dad. Okay. Excuse me. Dad. Dad, this is Aaron. And my father. Good evening. It's nice to meet you, young man. Okay, I'll leave you for now. Okay. Auntie Ampy. Oh careful, careful with my birdie. Auntie Ampy, this is Aaron. Aaron, this is my Auntie Ampy. Good evening. Hello handsome. How are you, Aaron? Well, it seems you're interested with my birdie. So that's why this girl is weird, her whole family is weird. - Pardon? - Auntie Ampy! You didn't warn me. You're bringing someone handsome. Auntie, someone is calling you. - Calling? - Over there. Over there. Where? Calling? What did your auntie say? I didn't understand. You know what, just ignore it. Maybe she got sick with typhus when she was a child and wasn't able to recover. Oh my God, insecure. Clarisse, what is this?! Your drunk uncle puked on me again! Just tell my father. Bishop, this is Aaron. Aaron, this is Bishop, my friend. Bro! Ah, forgive me. It still has vomit. I wasn't able to wash my hands yet. Bishop, what's wrong with you?! No, no, it's okay. Where's your CR? There. Clarisse. Bishop, what's the matter?! Just tell my father. Why? There are two men kissing inside. What? Benj. Mark. You're turning our café into a motel again. Hey, go outside. Okay. Oh, Clarisse. That's Benj. He's a trash artist. He is making art out of garbage. You know, the broken bicycles, he puts lights on them. They're already art. The other one, that is Mark, his boyfriend. Musician. Ethic musical instruments are his specialty. Okay. Excuse me. I won't take long. You look different. You don't like it? No, I like it. I like it very much. Shall we go? I'll just ask permission from my father. You okay? Oh, Monty. Hey, bro. How are you? Bro. Who's that with you? You don't know her? Clarisse! Anyway, anyway. Monty, this is Clarisse. - Clarisse, this is Monty, my friend. - Hi! Clarisse? I'll see you around, dude. Hi, Aaron. Maan. Have I introduced you to Clarisse yet? Oh. Anyway this is Maan, my ex-girlfriend. Maan, this is Clarisse. Let's go. Aaron! This is for you. Go on. Go on. Go on. Another. Another. Go on. What? Is he good at kissing? Really? What else? What do you mean what else?! It ended with a kiss. My God, that Aaron is so weak. Cynch, we're different. Anyway, now that he's your boyfriend- Actually, I don't know if he's my boyfriend. What?! Then why did you let him kiss you?! It just happened. After all, it's just a kiss. What's important is that you love each other. Actually, Cynch, I don't know if he really loves me. What?! Because he never said 'I love you' to me. You're so crazy. We're just the same. Kissing someone even though he's not yet your boyfriend. It's good, right? He will say it soon. One of these days. Maybe that's him! Gosh! This friend of mine - is playing hard to get. - Hello? Bishop, why? What?! What channel? Okay, okay. Bye. Oh, what happened? Dindi's daddy is on the news. Huh?! Why?! Accused with graft and corruption. Come, hurry! According to the senator's exposé, A huge amount was allegedly embezzled by the former Education Undersecretary, Emmanuel Buenavides, When he was still serving at the mentioned position. A two million peso estafa case will be filed against him. My daddy is innocent. He is not a thief. He was just used as a scapegoat by his former superior. Clarisse, it's not true. My daddy is not a thief. We know. Dindi. Calvin. I came as soon as I heard the news. Calm down. We know full well that your daddy can never do that. Uncle Emman can never do that. Everything will be okay. Calvin, wait. Where are you going? Why are you in a hurry?! Clarisse just beeped me. There's a problem at Dindi's place. But we have plans. Let's just cancel it for now. We already cancelled this the other day. But there's a problem at Dindi's place. You speak of nothing but that Dindi! Maris, Dindi was the only one who helped me when I had a problem. It's only right for me to console her. But you're losing time for me. I'm sorry, Maris. If our plan doesn't push through today. Forget it forever. What now? Calvin! Why? Don't you trust me? I do. Come here. This is my room. It’s nice. That's my favorite song. Me too. Isn't it romantic? Aaron, no! Don't you trust me? Don't you respect me?! Clarisse. Clarisse. Clarisse. Wait. I'm sorry. Clarisse. I respect you. And... And? Will you forgive me? You should go to school. I said I don't want to. My classmates would just spread rumors about me. Just ignore them! But Calvin, I don't want to. No more buts, you will go to school. I will take you there. Come on. Come on. My gosh! I said I don't want to. Dindi, let's go. Please. Please. Get in. Hey, Dindi! Dindi! Dindi! Where are you going?! Hey! Come here. I said I don't want to! Let's go, don't be stubborn. - You will go to school. - What's with you?! I don’t want to. Dindi, please? Please? Fine. Okay. Okay. Yes. I promise you that we will go tomorrow. Okay? Fine. Okay. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. So stubborn! It's your fault. You reconciled with her. Before, you told me. What you like about a girl, Is someone beautiful, kind, sweet, patient, supportive, And most of all, someone with good cooking skills! Bro, Maris doesn’t have any of those. Beauty is all she has. If I were you, I'll break up with her. I will just court Dindi. Huh?! If I were you, court her. Because you look good together. But I don't have feelings for her. Maybe you just don't know it yet. Calvin, Bishop, I have good news for you. My daddy got cleared off from his graft and corruption charges. Really?! Yes. It was proven that it was his superior who took the money. That's good! Sir, here's your collection. Okay. There you go, Pola. You should throw those away and burn them. Okay? Why? For I have met the woman that I will respect and love. Really, sir?! Gosh! It’s good that you found her! I've been waiting for that for a long time. Huh? You're so naughty, Pola. You know what, get those and burn them. Quick! Okay. Okay, alright. You know what, she is the first woman to refuse me physically. I really admired her for that. Bro, you know what, I'm telling you, I'm really sure. She's the one I'm going to marry. But of course, not now. In the future. She will be the future Mrs. Aaron Nakpil. So what now, bro? Aren't you going to say anything? Won't you congratulate me? What is happening to you? Bro, I did something wrong to you. What is it? I told Maan what we talked about before. Because Maan talked to me. She told me that she wants to come back to you. She realized that she really loves you. I didn't know that you and Clarisse are already developing your relationship. That is why I told Maan the truth. That is the truth, Clarisse. Aaron dressed you up to show me that he can turn anyone into a campus figure. He just used you. I don't believe you. Then don’t. Okay, just think of this. What do you think is the reason why he changed your personality? Because he loves you? Clarisse. Clarisse! I've been looking for you. What's wrong?! Just ask Maan right there. Aaron, let her go. Please stay away from me! What are you doing here? - May I talk to Clarisse? - No. Uncle Bart, please. I just want to explain. You don't have to explain anything, Aaron. What happened is clear to me. You deceived my daughter. But, Uncle. Stop calling me uncle! I let you in here. Treated you like family. And this is how you would repay me? - But... - Just go. Please. I'm not a violent person, Aaron. But if it's for my daughter, I can be. My gosh, Clarisse. My gosh, that's enough. You know what, Aaron is truly a worthless guy. That's why don't waste your tears on him. He's not worth it. I have an idea, let's do it like this. We'll create another imaginary boyfriend. This time we'll make sure that he's so, so perfect. What do you say? All boys are just the same. You know what, Clarisse, not all boys are the same. Not all of them are cheaters. Sometimes, it is us, girls, that allow them to cheat. I know now! Why don't we have an out of town trip? Since the sembreak is getting closer, right? So, we will go back to our favorite beach resort? Then we will have a drink. Then we will sing. Then we will dance. Then all of our stupidity with those boys will fade away! It’s nice, right?! Hi guys! What's up? Let's go to the beach. When? During the sembreak. Really?! You know, that's perfect. I'll tell Bishop and our friends since we have plans today. Do you want to come? We don't. Okay, bye. It’s okay. You know, Calvin is really worthless. All those boys are just the same! My scarf fell off. Calvin. I'm leaving. Take care of your siblings. Yeah, Ma. - Take care. - Bye. Take care! Sure. Dear diary, Calvin sat beside me yesterday. Then he placed his arms around me. He even said, once we go to beach, He will teach me how to swim. My God. What is this that I'm doing? I'm just fooling myself. The person is already avoiding me, But here I am, writing down some illusions. All the opposite. I need to accept the fact that Calvin can never like me. He only treats me as a friend. Dindi. Did you get your class card on P.E? Not yet. Come, let's go together. What is that? Nothing. Anyway, I have a surprise for you. What? The diary of your boyfriend's girlfriend. Huh? I got this from the trash can. Okay then. See you next sem. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Hi, Dindi. You left this. Where did you get that? From the trash can. Where it belongs. - Give it to me. - Hey. We're having barbeque at Calvin's place, When that Maris arrived all of a sudden. Who wouldn't do anything but to keep following after Calvin. Her face is so thick! Even though she knew that Calvin has a boyfriend Yet she kept flirting! How good you are with creating illusions. I am the girlfriend, but you're showing me off as an antagonist. Give it to me! And here's another one. Calvin told me that I shouldn't feel jealous about Maris. Because, he just sees her as a friend. I'm the one he really loves. My God! Illusions are at a height! Calvin sees you as a friend. He doesn't love you. Don't create illusions! She's not creating illusions, Maris! Everything that is written there is true. I love her. I just realized it now. I love you, Dindi. You're all shameless! Stop it, Maris! You cheated on me. Let's go. We can always be friends, Maris! Friends, your face! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch, ouch! Ouch! Calvin, are you okay? Does it hurt? I'm okay now. Hey, can you come with me? I don't want to. What is it that you don't want?! Come with me, please? I'm scared of that. - You? Scared? - I don't want to. Calvin, please? Please, please?! What is that?! Kiss me. Do you want this? Yes, I really want that! Calvin, you're dead once I catch you! Get in! Clarisse. Auntie? I'm okay, Auntie. Yes, I am totally convinced that you're "okay." That's really how "okay" is. Will cry all of a sudden. I already told you, You're okay. Auntie, why is it like that? It's so painful. It's really like that, Clarisse. How I wish that I didn't fell in love if this will be the ending. It’s really like that, honey. You know what, back in the day, When I was younger, Maybe around... I've been with 50 guys... But all of them didn’t have happy endings. Really?! Yes. But you know, I didn't regret anything. About my experiences. Because, I loved. And I'm sure, somehow, I received that same love in return. It may be hard from the start. Maybe the ending's painful. But it's happy in between. For me? That's good enough. Don't you want to have a boyfriend again, Auntie Ampy? My gosh! I'm too pretty if I say that I don't want to. But no one's stumbling for me. Oh, wait! I thought of something. What if I'll try to chat in the internet. You don't know, I might find a boyfriend. Auntie! Why? Just a chit-chat. Why, who among us is an old maid? You! Bro, what are you doing here? Why are you sulking? You are thinking of Clarisse again, aren’t you? Bro, I'm really sorry. It's nothing, bro. It's over. Oh, bro, come join the gang. Okay. I'll follow after. Hello. Hi. We can't answer the phone right now. So just leave your name, message and telephone number and we’ll call you back as soon as we can. Bye! Hi, Clarisse. It’s me. I just called to say that I'm really, really sorry. If I could only turn back the time. To fix what happened to us. You know what? I passed by the street where we sprayed paint. And I saw your name. I remembered the days when we were still happy. But I only felt lonelier, Because it's all over. Please. It's getting hard for me. Did you enjoy the poetry reading? Really? Why are you sad? The poems are fun. No, I'm just tired, Ma. You know well that our finals just ended recently. My gosh, The tape got stuck again. Okay, Ma, good night. Okay, good night. Hello, Bart. Oh? We're here. Oh, just take Auntie Paring home. Okay. Bye. Bye. Good morning, Pa. Good morning. Pa, what are you doing? I'm looking for the answering machine's tape. Why? Your Auntie Marie called. She left a phone number. I need to get that number. I need to talk to her. Pa, I'll have breakfast now, I still need to go to class. Okay. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ma. Okay go, eat now. Hello, Bart. This is Marie. I thought you're going to call me? But you still haven't. Anyways this is my number again. 9387563, I'll wait for your call. Hi, Clarisse. It's me. I just called to say that I’m really really sorry. If I could only turn back the time. To fix what happened to us. I passed by the street where we sprayed paint. And I saw your name. I remembered the days when we were still happy. But I only felt lonelier because it's all over. And you know what? I think about you everyday. Every hour. Every minute. Every moment. You're always in my mind. Because I love you. Yes, I love you. I don't know why I failed to tell you this, But that's the truth. I love you very, very much. So please give me another chance, Clarisse. Please. It's getting hard for me. He sounded sincere. Why don't you go to him? Give him a chance. Thank you, Pa. Why the hurry? Where will she go? - Hi. - Oh! Where’s Aaron? Oh no. He just left. Huh? Where did he go? To Antipolo. The helicopter will fetch him there. Why? Where will he go? Davao, their province. It's your fault. He's been waiting for your call for so long. Why didn't you call? It’s because... My gosh! Don't act like whatever that is. Go on. Go after him. You know it right? Okay. Go, girl! Go! Oh, no. Hope she doesn't reach him. So when he comes back, he'll be mine forever! Mister, mister. Can you please hurry? Mister, can you please hurry? Aaron, wait! Aaron, wait! This is the first time I felt this. I need to fight for this. Let's go back! Let's go back! Clarisse. Let's go down! Let's go down! Clarisse! Clarisse! I'm sorry. I just- I'm the one who needs to say sorry. I love you. I love you too. So that's the ending of the love story of my friend, Clarisse. Happy ending, of course. Because she fought for her feelings. But I realized, it's not important whether you chase after or wait for your loved one. If it's meant for you, it will surely come to you. Cynthia on the other hand, told us that she will stop falling in love for now. She got burned out. She also said that maybe the problem lies with her. She makes herself so available. That is why next time, she will try to play hard to get. I think Bishop and Cynthia will end up together. They get along well. They just don't know it yet. But who knows what will really happen. But what I believe, every heart that ever dreamed of love, Will find a match. A fulfilment.
