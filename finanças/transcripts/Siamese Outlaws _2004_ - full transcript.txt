Bai, there's someone here to see you. Lamai, this is my brother, Khao. He's the one I told you about. He's well known in Ayuthaya. When anyone hears his name they shit themselves. I met him in jail. We escaped together. Hey! How could you bring an armed stranger here? Sorry, Boss. Diaw, take their weapons. Hurry up! Who the fuck taught you to hand over the gun like that? Here's how you do it, you bastard! I've taught you so many times, now remember it! Remember this if you want to survive! The town is prospering. They've already opened seven or eight goldshops. There's also shops and luxury houses. There's plenty to rob. The market is perfect. There's only one road that passes by the market. I'll shut down the whole bloody town. Close the whole town? We need lots of men. That's why I'm here. If Bai want's to go, he'll need my permission. Boss, what do you think? Fucking Diaw! You little shit! I'll kick your ass. Where the fuck are you? Come here! How many times have I told you not to run out of booze? Remember! Remember! Fucking dog! Stupid buffalo! Why are you so rough with him? Do you pity this prick? He's my slave. I can do whatever I want with him. Listen, if you kill this prick, I'll agree to help you. Do you have enough guts to do it? If not, then just get the hell out of here! Bai. Tomorrow you go to Town of Kan and bring Sak back. Sak has arrived, as requested. - Hi, brother Sak. - Hello. Priaw, Wan. God bless you. What God? We're all bandits here. Bai, you're a real pain in the ass these days. Brother Sak, didn't you tell you'd be here two days from now? I'm here early because I'm excited of the news of the big heist. We got in gear and immediately got here. Any hookers around here? Yeah! Any whores around here? With big tits? Hookers are hard to find around here. There's only gold. I'm more worried whether you'll have enough strength to do the heist? I'll pretend I didn't heard that. This is Khao and his gang. Can we trust them? You're right. If you're not brave enough for this job and screw it up, we'll all end up in the slammer! - Are you testing me? - Why not? Son of a bitch! We don't appreciate death until we've had a taste of it. Brother, calm down. I'm begging you. Khao's my friend and I assure you that he can be trusted. We've checked the area around the market. There's only one road that leads to the police station. We can block it easily. In the market, there's lots of gold shops near each other. It won't take long to rob all of them. If everything goes according to plan, we'll escape through the village of Phai Riw. We'll be able to escape to Lop Buri and Sara Buri. If we're cornered, we can escape across the river. I insist on one thing only. No unnecessary killings during this heist! Are you kidding? This is a raid! Not a temple ceremony. Of course there'll be some shooting. This is a gun not a trumpet. Isn't it Priaw? Hey, listen to the orders you two! Just do what you're told! Maybe you'll end up as millionaires, right? Khao's in charge of this heist. Everybody must do everything according to my plans! I'm checking the time! Diaw, keep an eye on the driver. Don't let him escape or I'll kill you! Joon, Ban. Block the Police Station. Everybody! Let's charge! You want to die? I'm not in the mood for killing today. Put all the gold in the bag, quickly! You're packing it up, my dear? Stick it all in there! Thanks a lot, madam... Don't hurt us! It's a robbery! I know. Put the gold in that bag! Here! In this bag! Why are you so fucking slow? Hey, why did you guys shoot him? Didn't we agree about not killing anyone? He shot me first. The bullet almost hit my head. Look, he killed that guy too. The thieves are here! Follow me. Chen! Let her go. I'm taking her with me and fucking her later! Bastard! After the robbery, you can fuck as many hookers as you'd like! I'll just do her quickly, then let her go! If you won't do what you're told, get the fuck out of here! - Let go! - Go! Why should we divide this with 5 others? What if we keep it and run? What the hell are you talking about? If they hear us, we're dead! If you want to be a tiger then hide your claws. Only dogs shows their claws. Are you a tiger or a dog? - A tiger! So we agree then. Pack up. Can't you tell us anything? What's your boss thinking? Sir! Sir! Please! This is the market area where it all happened. It's about 10km from our last standoff. There were about 20 bandits. They were heavily armed. Our weapons stood no chance. They robbed the market in broad daylight. At the time, I was doing inspections at Phai Riw village. I went after them as soon as I found out. We caught up with them and exchanged fire. Suddenly they stopped shooting. We could hear no gunfire from them. So I ordered my men to surround them and try to catch them. This is unbelievable... They all vanished! I don't care who they are! No matter how they managed to escape. Everybody in this room has a duty to find and catch them! But these aren't your ordinary thieves. They're invincible. Guns and knifes won't hurt them. Are you scared too, Lieutenant? How could you neglect your duties like this? How could you let those bandits slip through? We're the laughing stock of the country. May I? Go ahead. I have a plan. Our analysis shows that they disappeared around Phai Riw village. I don't think they managed to get too far. They may be hiding around here somewhere. I've ordered our men to check the area inch by inch. Not even a fly could slip through. They'll be long gone by now. Indeed, what the Lieutenant's said is correct. But personally, I don't think those bandits would stay in one place. By now they must have split up and gone in different directions. By the time we start searching every houses, they'll be even further away. So inspector, do you have a better plan? Sergeant Pol. What's that? Is it a handkerchief? Have you ever heard of the Red Scarfs gang? There's a group of bandits near Kan who wears red scarfs like this. Their gang is called Sak Phanto. Wait till things quiet down. I'll then sell all the gold. We'll divide the money later as agreed. Lamai, my men want to know exactly when you'll sell the gold and divide the money. On the 15th day of the decreasing moon we'll all meet here. A Buddhist holy day, perfect! Only 7 days to go! Hey guys! We'll all gonna be rich soon! Exactly who is going to buy this giant load of gold? I know a dealer who's loaded with cash. He'll fence anything . Come on, you just have to trust me. I assure you that everybody will get their money! How do we know you won't screw us? Yeah... Why should we think you won't rip us off? If I wanted to rip you off, you wouldn't be here talking about it. I'd have gotten rid of you after the fucking robbery! Lamai! Khao! Let's not joke like this! You'll make my men worried. Come on... We're all buddies! We're all in this together. Lamai won't cheat us. You won't do that, right? Louder, louder! Are you interested? I can moan louder. You were very good. Everything OK outside? Yeah, it's quiet. Actually, it's even quieter then usual. You got your new prayer scarf? We've got to get out of here. Yeah... right here. But this time, the monk asked me loads of questions. What have I done with the other scarf, who I was and with whom etc. etc... Worse then a cop. Shit! What did you tell him? I told him everything. It's a sin lying to a monk. Shit! We're screwed! Have you got your bags ready? Get moving! - What? - It stinks. Where's Ang? Sak, we're finished! The cops are here! Let's get the fuck out of here! Hey move! Over there! Police, freeze! We know. They are only fakes. It depends whether you believe in it, inspector. Why do you have so many amulets? I'm keeping them as a memento. Wan, I'm going to tell you a story. My father was a soldier. He died in combat. My mother was a singer. That's why I have an artistic side. I love nature and sunshine but I hate to be looked down upon. How did you get like that? A bandit assaulted me. That's why I hate them. Officer Pol's mother got remarried when her father got shot by a thief. We have something in common. When he gets irritated, even I can't restrain him. So now what do you think? Inspector, can I have a cigarette? You can come in now. He passed out and fell off the chair. Last month we drank together at Sak's place in Lopburi. We wanted to get drunk before going to town to party. Lamai asked Khao... Hey! Talk more slowly and clearly! Nobody understands when you mumble like that. OK, continue. Last week... Let's do it! Why are you just standing there? Can we please just stay here and keep an eye on the car? No! We've plundered so many times already! You want to get shot? Move! Move! Move! - I'm watching the car. - You too, move it! I beg you. Don't hurt me! Silent! I don't usually do this but I have no choice. For heaven's sake, don't rob me! Don't rob me, please! Khao! Why did you shoot her? She's older than your mother! No point in keeping her around. Your first shot killed her already! Why did you need to shoot her again? She wasn't actually dead yet. Why are you talking so much? This is our share. I told you to shut up! Take the rest of the gold. It's exactly what Wan said, Inspector. This is all I know. We're always together everywhere. I really have no clue what the others are doing. This means that Khao is the boss, right? What about Lamai? He wasn't there. He was doing his ritual. What ritual? It was a major heist. He had to use magical spells. You know, so we'll have good fortunes and protection against evil spirits. Lamai has more then one trick up his sleeve. He knows incantations to make himself invisible, as well as incantations to become invincible. He knows loads of handy tricks. Enough nonsense Priaw. Just tell us where your boss is. Come on, inspector... I'm really sorry. I'm here with you. How can I know where he is? You told me Lamai can make himself invisible. How about you? Inspector... Sure, of course I can! Alright. If you really can become invisible, then disappear right now. I won't hunt you down either. I'll even close the case for you. Right? Is this what makes you invisible? Here, Priaw. Now, disappear right now. Come on, let's take a break. You've got some sense of humor. He's going to regret mocking me. Officer, give me a cigarette. Inspector, there's a problem! Inspector, you can see me? Oh, I forgot. Today is Buddhist holy day. The incantation won't work. A holy day? Come here. A holy day, right? It's not a holy day today! It's the day of your misfortune! Get out! Continue with your break! Don't worry Rin. I'll take care of it. There's no need to rush. When? Don't be so impatient! You're not my only client. Did I ever let you down? Here's half. You'll get the rest when the job is done. I'm giving you only three days. You're acting kind of weird. It seems like you're in a big hurry. You wouldn't have been involved in the market robbery would you? Mind your own business! Watch your big mouth! I'm Yong, the amulet master! Not Yong the big mouth! What were you doing at Yong's shop? Yong said you asked him for a boat. Where were you planning on going? Don't play dumb. Don't you think I know who you are? You're Phairin Samoechan. Khao's wife. Tell me where your husband is hiding. He's in jail. He escaped a long time ago. Really? He hasn't been home for a long time. Who the hell knows where he is? How did you survive, you and the baby... if he didn't send you any money? So don't you think women have hands or feet? Do you want to feed your baby in jail? Officer! My baby's hungry. Can I go now? If not, I'll breastfeed it here! Don't do that here. Get out... go. Welcome! Welcome sir. Welcome, novice monks. Did you empty the whole temple? Yes, Chief. The whole temple is here. Good work! Excellent! Father Khem, welcome. Welcome, welcome! Who invited all these monks here? I thought you wanted to question the monks from Klangtung Temple. I only wanted to see monk Khem, not all the monks! But the other monks might know Khao. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Are you finished? Yes, sir. Excuse me monk Khem. Bless you. Please welcome in. You wouldn't happen to have any good amulets for me? You want one? They all bring luck. But it's up to someone to be good or evil. Novice monk, did you plunder with Khao? You act weird. What is it? I need to take a shit. Were you in the same class as Khao? Is he your friend? No. I think he went to school before me. Khao, the police worked their way up to Yong. They interrogated me as well. It's probably the new inspector who's on this case. He's not going easy on it. I know. What are you going to do? I'll wait for the money, then I'll leave. Let me go with you. Forget it. It's not the cops I'm worried about. It's our own men. You sure you haven't lied to me? Are you accusing a monk of lying? That's a sin! How would I know where that bandit Khao is? He doesn't report to me what he's doing after each job. He reveres in you a lot and comes to your temple often. Yes, quite often. When he asked me for a Pra Rod amulet, of course I gave him. I have no idea if it is or isn't an act of veneration. Where is his house? That's hard to say. Every time I've seen him it's been at the temple. He's never taken me to his house either. Your emotions may eventually lead you into calamity. It's meal time. If I don't say anything you'll keep me here anyway and my brothers will miss their meal. He knew we were coming. Officer Pol, let's go. Sargent! Lay down or I'll shoot your guts out! Spit it out. Where was Lamai heading? I know nothing, sir. Liar! I've told you everything already, really. I have no idea where they are. But you were collaborating with them! I was forced to or else they would have of killed me. What about Khao? Khao lives in Ayuthaya. Lamai lives in Angthong. So how did they end up together? Jun, stay here and guard the car. Khao and Baen, you two go first. I need to piss. I'll catch up with you. Hurry up! Let's go. Khao, why is it so quiet? Watch out! He's over there! Baen! Jun, start the car! Go! Go! Go! Oyyyy! Shit! You arrived right on time! If it's about money, I'm never late. Chen, so are they all dead? Cops were all over the forest, they'll never make it! Good job! Betraying your friends like this... But after all, this happens all the time. Like a big bird has to eat a big meal. I heard that Diaw got caught. He must have told the police everything. Don't worry. He didn't know much. It's your men I'm worried about. Priaw and Wan are bandits, not dogs. Even if they're tortured they won't say a word. I hope so. Is the buyer here? I don't see anyone. He's on his way. I need five shares. Whoever's not standing here, is not entitled to get any shares! Do you want to bargain with me? When I told you to get rid of Khao after the robbery, you didn't even managed to do that! All right, I agree then. Yes, yes... of course. How the hell did this happen? Are you kidding me? Bai! Did you look in the trunk before you brought it here? No, sir. Don't lie to me, Bai! I swear. How could I open it? You're the one who's got the key. - Perhaps you stashed away the gold yourself? Sak! They want to trick us! I think so too! I'll give you a second chance Sak. Since you're my friend, we'll fight a duel. Khao! Let's split up. Loet! It's me Tueng. What are you doing here Wii? Khao, come on out! Loet! Khao! Wii. Because of our friendship, I'll let you go this time. You betrayed me and now you want to talk about being friends? The person who really betrayed you wasn't Khao. You should already know who did. Ask Yong who sold him the gold. Yong, do you know anything about the gold? No. No? You really know nothing? I don't know anything, really! Loet, watch the entrance! I swear I know nothing! I sell amulets and antiques. Nobody contacted me. Are you lying to me? Stuff that in his mouth! Talk. Or I'll break your fingers one by one. Tell me! Tell me! I swear that I don't know anything! Don't fool around with me, Yong! Why the hell are you back up here? I told you to watch the entrance! The inspector said don't worry he'll watch it for us. Son of a bitch! A sinner like you doesn't deserve good amulets like this. They won't protect you. Are you gonna tell me now where your boss is hiding? What are you afraid of? Talk or I'll punch your head off! Bai. You don't look stupid at all. You're a very clever person. How could you let Lamai trick you like this? What the hell are you talking about? Your men told us everything. Your boss betrayed you. Even your friend Khao informed on you. There's no loyalty amongst thieves. You're all crooks. Cops like you are no different than me! We're all bad! Of course we're different. You guys kill good guys. But I only kill bad guys. I read in the newspaper that Bai and his gang will be be executed tomorrow. You should pack up. We'll leave tomorrow night. There's too many cops around here. Are you scared? No. All I want is to be near you and the baby. Khao... Do you remember your promise? That you would quit after this heist? May your bad karma end, Jun. We must endure our pain for our karma in future. You're a monk. You should never have helped these thieves. Inspector, I am a monk and it's my duty to help anyone with problems whether it's a thief or a cop. I have to help people that's why I am a monk. But you've helped bad people. They stole and killed many innocent people. Compassion is above good or evil. But I'm a cop. To me, the law is above karma. Whether good or bad. That is from your point of view. The good, the evil... It's the intent that counts. Where's Khao? Chen! It's me. Aren't you happy to see an old friend? So you thought you knew me well, Khao? I didn't have a choice, Khao. I'd never get rich staying with your gang. Tell me, where's the gold? Not telling, eh? Not gonna talk eh? Tell me where the gold is! Lamai got it. Officer Maen... Officer Maen... You're here! How did you get here? The cops told me you were dead. I just wanted to tell you that the goods are still in the same place. I was right to trust you. You did the right thing by surrendering to the police. Otherwise you'd be dead by now. Khao... Do you remember your promise? That you would quit after this heist?
