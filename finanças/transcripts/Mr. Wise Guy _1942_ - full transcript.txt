♪♪ ♪♪ Now listen, you're kinda new in this neighborhood so I'm gonna wise you up. I'm Muggs McGinnis, the leader of this gang. Now, if you want to take any of the boys out, you gotta have them in by 3:00 in the afternoon. And no smoking, drinking, or Hopscotch 'cause we're all in training. Now I'm gonna introduce you to the fellas in their physical order. This is Danny, my left-hand man. How do you do? This is Glimpy, might right-hand man. Hello, Matilda. Pewee, my "yes" man. Hiya. And Skinny, my "no" man. Hi. And last but not least is Scruno. He's our blackout warden. Hi. Now you met them all, and you can do-- hey. Hey, you kids, get out of here. Hey, gland trouble. See ya later. Oh, wait, take that-- take her hand and take her easy. Now, I wonder how that could have happened. I don't know, but they can't blame us for it. But we was here. That's circumstantial evidence. Well, let's dig. All right, let's get out of here. [man] Hey, stop them! [boys laughing] [all shouting] Hey! Uh-oh. What do we do now? Sing "Mammy," that'll stop 'em. Look out! Where did they go? [Muggs] Now take it easy, Mother. Don't aggravate your rheumatism. Oh, good morning, officer. What's new? Next on that. What's your hurry? We're just getting our exercise taking our girls for a walk. I was just taking my mother to the races. Why did you break that window? [high voice] Who broke my window? Quiet, Mother. Then why were you running? We always get blamed so we run. There ain't no law against running, unless you're a politician. You kids are always doing something. If ain't one thing, it's another. You're just a bunch of hoodlums. [fakes crying] Is that a nice way to talk in front of a poor "discreptic" lady? Don't let it get to you, Clarice. Coppers ain't got no manners. I got a good mind to have your badge confiscated. Come on, wise guy. [all shouting distinctly] Hey, officer, hey, officer! Would you unhook me? Ah, come on. Come on, let's go! You can't arrest us without a corpus delicious. Wait till my lawyer hears about this. There's gonna be a big shake-up around here. [all talking at once] [Muggs] You mean we gotta walk? Where's the patrol wagon? All right, baker, which one of these boys broke your window? They didn't break it. I broke it myself. Every time I get in there, I break something. Ain't I the clumsiest thing? Ain't that too bad? Now you don't get your promotion. Why don't you guys think of something else to do besides make us miserable? Sabotage. What chance has a little guy got against the corporation? Yeah. Hey, there goes our taxi! Okay, if you four guys will excuse us-- Who pumps you up? [screaming] Hurry up! Come on, Scruno. I couldn't run no faster than this truck if it was full of watermelon. You'll be pickin' watermelon for the next five years if you don't hurry up. If you hurry up, we'll give you a million dollars. [driver] Hey, you kids, get off the truck. Save it for the finance company. Who's your old boss? If you don't get off, I'll brain ya! Ah, shut up, the pedestrian has the right of way. He talks like he owns this thing. Don't go so fast, I got a nervous stomach. Come on, get off the truck, will ya? What a terrible taxi, no radio. Huh. Listen, come on, get off of here. Hey, shorty, will you back up about two blocks? You passed my office. Yeah, I-- What are you talking about? Get outta here! Come on, here, here. Come on,get! Hey, let them dogs alone, I've been running, man. I'm gonna run some more right now. [screaming] Whoo! [whimpering] Hey, Bill. Hiya, Danny. Remember me? I'm your brother. What are you doing down here? This letter came for you, so I brought it down. It's from the government. My grandfather got a letter from the government once. What was it, an invitation to Sing Sing? Alcatraz. Well, kid, looks like your brother's in the army. Oh, that's swell, Bill. [laughs] Private Bill Collins reporting. [all shouting] [alarm bell ringing] Listen. Hey, what's that? That's a siren on Blackwell's Island. Somebody busted loose. It's most likely a false alarm. Let's take a look. See you later, Bill, see you later. Come on. Hey, what do you see? Seagulls. Hey. You got any clues? No, you guys got any? No, I think it's a false alarm just like Bill said. Boy, if I could nab this convict, I'd graduate from my detective correspondence course with honors. It's better to graduate with good marks. Hey, there's a guilty-looking personality. Let's go over and get a confession. But don't break no bones. Come on. Are you the guy that escaped from the island? Ay, go on, beat it, scram, you guys! It's our chauffeur. [all talking at once] How ya been? Go on, get away from here, will ya? Don't get so tough, the streets are free. Sure, we're private detectives. We're from the Burns Agency. Ever hear of my uncle, third-degree burns. Well, you must've heard of Charlie Chan. This is his stablemate, Charlie Horse. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Horse. Take his picture and send it to the funny paper. I got a better idea, I'll send it to Ripley. I bet he won't believe it. Yes, he would. Hey, give me that camera! [all shouting] What are you looking for, a match? I got a match right here. Don't go away. I'm not going no place. Here's a match. Hey, he's got a rod! Don't shoot! That's ain't a rod, that's a gun. Is it loaded? Sure, it's loaded. Let me see. Give me that thing. You wanna get hurt? [boat horn blowing] Hey, the cops. Let's scram. Hey, where you going? I don't think he likes cops. Hey, listen, make like you're working here, see? Do something, jump on that truck. Move those barrels. [boys shouting indistinctly] What are you kids doing in that truck? We're just upright citizens trying to make an honest dollar. After all, we've got wives and babies to support. Cut out the wisecracks. Seen you kids before, haven't I? Maybe it was at the races. Or was it Pam Beach? It was juvenile court. Don't tell me you were in trouble, officer. Get down out of there. You can't blame a guy for trying to fill up his social security fund. We don't want to mooch on a city like you. Let me see your driver's license. Driver's license, I know. You just wanna prove that you can read. There you are. On the other side's a very nice picture of my Aunt Sue. Skinny old thing, isn't she? Is there anything else I can do for you, officer? No, Mr. Wise Guy. Well, you sure you wouldn't want to search the truck? Look in one of them barrels and see if that lug from Blackwell's Island ain't one of them? Yeah, maybe he's learned to swim in wine. Get outta here. [car starts] That's what I call wasting a taxpayer's money. Good-bye now. I'm glad they're gone. Heads up. Money in the making. Oh, that'll be a pleasant change. Being broke is gettin' monotonous. All right, Luke. Yeah, make it snappy. [Muggs] Hey, how about a little help from the All-American Longshoremen's Association? Go on, scram. Hey, Knobby! You looking for the guy that's driving that truck? Yeah, did you see him? He left when the cops came. Cops? Sure, by the way he took off, you'd think he was the guy that escaped from Blackwell's Island. He had to run. Have you ever been fingerprinted? Go on, beat it! I don't know, but it looks to me like you'll need a little help with that barrel. A little large for you, isn't it? Sure, I come from a long line of wine barrens. He means barrels. Okay, okay, help me get this on the truck. [all shouting] Easy now, take it easy! Come on, take it easy with that. Go on, get it on here. Get it up there. Don't injure yourself, boys. Don't injure yourself. I'll handle it. Hey, hey, grab it! Oh, you give up? Come on, give me a hand, will ya? All right, boys, give him a hand. You just didn't appreciate how useless we was. Thanks. Ay, wait a minute. Hey, how about a little gratuity here? [all shouting] Come on, six pieces, please. All right, that's a little better. What? Two bits! We've been laboring in a delusion. Hey, ain't you gonna wait for your change? Can you spare it? Spendthrift. Two bits, hmm. Take it easy! Hey, that's two packs of cigarettes. Hey, Muggs, what if we do find this Luke Manning's body? What'll we do with it? Throw it back to the fish. Hey, where's Glimpy? He can't swim. I don't know, he was around a minute ago. Oh, gosh, what if he drowned? Who's gonna tell his mother? Oh, he's an "orpheum." Orpheum, that's the name of a theater. [all shouting] Hey, fellas, look, whoa! [all shouting] The coppers, the cops! [boat horn blowing] Hey, you. What do you think you're doing? Who, me, officer? I'm just getting a bit of a suntan. That's all. Where are your pals? Oh, I don't know where they are. Are all these your clothes? Yes, sir, seven changes. One for every day in the week. Hey, you kids, come on out. What's eating you? Come on down, the water's fine for drowning. I don't want any trouble from you kids, so you better hop on up here. Yeah, we're coming. [Danny] What do you want? What's the trouble? Have you going for a ride. Gone for a ride? You're going to headquarters. Get on your clothes. So you'll be leaving for the army soon, eh, Bill? Yeah. I'm taking my physical next week. Sorry to see you leave, Bill. What are you gonna do about that kid brother of yours? That's what I want to talk to you about, Mr. Mullins. Sure, what's on your mind? Well, with my going in the army, Danny's gonna be on his own. But I don't want him running around the streets. I know what that leads to-- juvenile court and reform school. I saw enough of that kind of stuff when I was at the Wilton School for Boys. Yeah, so you once told me. Say, Bill, why did you quit that job? I didn't like the way they handled kids. That's why I've always done everything I could for Danny. So's he wouldn't have to see the inside of that or any reform school. You've done a good job of it, son. Thanks. The only thing that'll help Danny is a real job. Now, I was wondering if you could-- If I could put him to work, huh? Yeah, that's right, Mr. Mullins. Why, he's a big, strong kid. He could do this job easy. Bring around this afternoon. I'll see what I can do. Aw, that's swell, boss. You won't be sorry. Hey, Bill, Bill, the cops are arresting Danny and the gang. Arresting Danny?Yeah. Where is he? Over there. Let's go. Get away from this bathhouse, will ya, it's private. I think you're framing us. Go on, scram, you got fleas. Come on, get your clothes on. I'm gonna get the D.A. I'm gonna get the D.A.'s brother. What's the problem, officer? Who are you? I'm this kid's brother. Well, they stole a truck from Cherry Street. And there's no mistake about it, 'cause I got 'em red-handed. Stole a truck?! Look, Mr. Wise Guy, maybe you'll deny you weren't in the front seat of that truck. The battery's dead. And maybe you'll say that you didn't tell me that you were working for the company. You gotta tell a little white lie once in a while. Danny, is this true? Yeah, but we was only kiddin'. You were, were ya? Well, this warrant isn't a joke. So come along peacefully. Okay, but you'll be sorry you humiliated me in front of my friends. [all shouting] [officer] Get in there. [boys shouting] Dormitory three, workhouse. That means I do what, boss? You'll find out, and don't call me boss. Address me as mister. Okay, Mr. Boss. Ethelbert McGinnis. Ethelbert McGinnis! Ethelbert? Can you imagine a guy with a name like that? Which one of you is Ethelbert McGinnis? We got a McGinnis, but no Ethelbert. Oh, yes you have. Now, which one of you is it? Oh. What a terrible thing. Uh... I'm Ethelbert. You? I'm completely disillusioned. So you're Ethelbert McGinnis. Just kind of a thing, you know. It's been in the family for a long time. You might call it a skeleton in the family closet. It would make me very happy if we just kinda left it there and forgot about it. All right, Ethelbert. I wouldn't use that name if I was you. Just because my father made a mistake don't mean you have to do the same thing. Oh, a little wise guy, ay? Wise guy. That's it, call me Mr. Wise Guy. All right. Now, Mr. Wise Guy, what kind of work have you ever done? Work?Yeah. Yeah, yeah, work. I'm not familiar with the word. Well, we'll fix that. I was afraid you would. [knock on door] Come in. Can I do something for you? Why, yes, my name is Bill Collins. Danny Collins is my brother. Collins,Collins. Oh, yes, the wine-truck case. They were just admitted. That's right. You think I could see Danny? I'll see. Won't you come this way, please? Say, this place looks much better. Then you've been here before. Yeah, I was a guard for a year and a half. How interesting. Sure, if you like to see kids kicked around and starved. Oh, but you really don't know Wilton. Lady, I know plenty that isn't good about this place. Things have changed, as you've already noticed. We're here to help the boys, not to hurt them. Sorry if I blew up, miss. But I learned to hate the Wilton Reformatory. I understand. All right, that's all. So Jed Miller is still a guard here. Yeah, things have changed all right. What are you trying to do, miss, sell me a bill of goods? [Miller] Daniel Collins. Yes, sir. Maybe you remember my brother. He used to work here. Is that so? You must be Bill Collins's brother. That's me. Hoodlums must run in your family. Who do you think you're calling names? All right, I apologize. [boys shouting] [officer] Take it easy, you. Just a moment now. What's the trouble here? What's the trouble, Miller? Be careful here, Mr. Barnes. He's liable to attack you the way he did me. I know. His name is Bill Collins. He's that hoodlum's brother. Mr. Barnes, I can explain. Mr. Collins once worked here. Never mind explaining, lady. I can do that. I didn't come here to start a rumpus, but I don't like to see any kid get smacked around. Ah, smackin' around is too good for 'em. That's entirely unnecessary, Miller. And as long as I'm superintendent of this institution, no boy is to be struck. Well, you gotta make 'em respect authority, don't ya? There are even limitations to authority. I hope I make myself clear. Yes, sir. Mr. Collins, Miss Mitchell, would you please come with me? [Bill] Don't worry, kid. There's a guy that's gonna be all right. Yeah, maybe things won't be so bad after all. I won't forget this in a hurry. And neither will you. All right, my memory ain't so bad either. Mr. Collins, Jim Barnes is my name. How do you do? Ann Mitchell is mine. Mr. Collins, I'm afraid you never knew it, but your testimony and your written resignation was indirectly responsible for a new order here at Wilton. No, I didn't know that. Guess I was in too much of a hurry to get away. How would you like to take a look around the place now? I'd like it very much. I'm sure Miss Mitchell here wouldn't object to being your guide, would you, Ann? I'd be delighted. Gee, thanks a lot. We didn't have one of those when I was here. I told you things have changed. Bye. Bye. You know, if I wasn't going in the army, I wouldn't mind getting my old job back. I'm sure Mr. Barnes would like to have you. In fact, I wouldn't even mind getting sent to reform school. That is if the other half is anything like you. There's always the guard house in the army. Say, that gives me an idea. I'm taking my physical tomorrow and I need some more weight if I expect to make the grade. Now, how's about you helping me to put on a few pounds by having dinner with me tonight? Huh, ah, please, for Uncle Sam? All right. But remember, it's only for Uncle Sam. The army will never forget this. [both chuckling] "If the man is willing, say yes. If he's unwilling, say yes anyway." Oh, listen to this. "Don't be fickle or you'll be a forgotten bachelor." Let that be a warning to you. And don't forget to say yes anyway. Waiter, bring some more fortune cakes. I want to find out what happens to a bachelor who iswilling. Don't mind him, too much chop suey. It's gone to his head. That's not the only thing that's gone to my head. It's been so much fun, fattening you up for your physical. You know, I heard someplace that the easiest way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Should I take up cooking? ♪♪ [chuckles] It's one for the book. Okay, let's get going. Hey, stupid. Uh, calling me, boss? Thought I told you to lay off that bourbon. I-- I-- I'm not drinking any bourbon. Just a Bromo-Seltzer, that's all. [belches] See? Never mind. Now get this straight. Give me ten minutes, see? And keep the motor going. Okay. Be ready if I need you. And remember what I said about the bourbon. I wasn't drinking. I don't know when I've laughed so much. I never knew the Wilton Reformatory could give meanything to laugh about. I'm glad, Bill. Maybe your fortune's changing. It is. You know, I can even look into the future of Private Bill Collins. I never cared very much what was gonna happen to him after national defense. But I do now. I like you, Private Collins. I like your brother Danny, too. Danny's a good kid. In fact, if there were ten of you Collins boys, I'm afraid I'd like every one of you. Now you're the one who's fickle. I have a weakness for uniforms. Good night, Bill. Thanks for a lovely evening. Oh, good night, Ann. [gunshot] ♪♪ Do as I say or you're a dead pigeon. Police, help, help! ♪♪ Murderer, police! What's up? A man has been murdered. There they go! There they go, catch them. Follow that car. Get this thing out of low gear. ♪♪ Step on it, buddy, or I'll let you have it. ♪♪ [tires screeching] And that's how it happened. I had already taken Miss Mitchell home. I was out of cigarettes, so I stopped to buy some. You were not out. This half-filled package of cigarettes was found in your car. Explain that. I don't know anything about it. It wasn't mine. Besides, I don't open my package that way. That don't cut no ice. Green, the drug clerk positively identifies you as one of the bandits. I didn't do it. My word's as good as his. Collins, it's pretty simple what you did. You went ahead of your pals to see if the coast was clear. You bought a package of cigarettes for a stall. Then you stood guard at the door while the others shot and killed the drug clerk. I did not, I didn't do it. It's not true. Come on, Collins, now, who are your pals? Now, you're not gonna let them go free and you take this rap alone. Don't be a fool. Give us a lead and I'll see you get off easy. I promise. Bill, are you all right? Yeah. Why don't you question him when he's not ill? Lady, this is murder. But can't you see that's he weak? Come on, Collins. Now the fact remains you were driving the car in which one of the bandits made his getaway. What else could I do with a gun in my back? Do you think a man about to go in the army would commit a murder? Why, he was to take his physical today. Lady, if you're trying to use Uncle Sam as an alibi, save your breath. Facts are facts. I'm not trying to use Uncle Sam for an alibi. Oh, this is all crazy. I'm innocent, I tell ya. If you can prove that, Collins, you haven't anything to worry about. How do you like this? Who ever thought I'd become a chambermaid to a bunch of chickens? Always did wanna be an interior decorator. [Muggs] What a beautiful piece of muzzlin. It's got a regular English droop to it. Looks good, but that chest is too full. It's about two and a half inches for the chest. What are you doing to my suit? What's a matter with you? Oh, those shoulders droop. Just about five and a half inches right there. Oh, look at that seat is all wrong. [all talking at once] One more mark on this suit and I'll kick your back fence in. See that? You lacks the appreciation for the finer things in life. Why, it's a man's physical appearance that means everything in the end. If you don't dig mighty quick, your physical appearance is gonna change. Oh, well, all right! I'm going. Physical a-- Ay, by the way, wasn't your brother supposed to take his physical today? Yeah, I wonder how he came out. Hey, look what I found in the chickens' nest, an egg. You're quite a discoverer. You should be with Columbus. He's dead. That's what I said. What did you expect to find in that chicken nest, croquettes? Hey, I wonder if there's a chicken in here. Let me see and I'll tell you. That'll take a little scientific research. A chicken? Why, there's quintuplets in there. Yeah? Let me see. Hold it up to the sun and put it right on your eye, right up there like that. What are you, a wise guy or something? Mr. Wise Guy, remember? Here, go get yourself a union card. Watch the paint! What's the matter with you? Did you ever hear of Michelangelo? He started off painting chicken coops. Who's he? Why, he was a portrait painter. He used to paint men and women. Ah, that's nothing, I got an Uncle Louie. He did the exact same thing last year at the beach. He painted "men" on one door and "women" on the other. Let him have it. [Pewee] Hey, Mugsy! Well, look who's here. Hiya, gang. [Muggs] Hi, Pewee. Where you been around? We ain't seen ya. I been working in the office. So I'm an office boy, not bad, huh? If that's the case, you ought to be able to find out something I wanna know. What do you mean? Who's running this emporium? I don't get ya. Oh, you know, there's always a couple of guys that deal the cards around. Oh, they got a couple like that here. What's their names? Rice Pudding Charlie and Chalky Jones. But they've been here a long time. That's fine. I'll have to meet those two boys. You won't have to meet 'em. They'll look you up. Oh, they will? Well, that's very belligerent. So that's the new gang that moved in, huh? Well, there's nothing like getting acquainted. Yeah, things are kinda dead around here since Barnes took over. I hear that Chalky Jones and Rice Pudding Charlie had things pretty much to themselves under the old superintendent. Yeah? But they only got one connection now. Who? That guard Miller. Miller, huh? There's a guy that should get himself a new job breaking in guillotines. Yeah, but Chalky and Charlie are in strong with him. They cutting up anything? Yeah, they work in a commissary. That sounds like a soft touch to me. Best job in here. I told you they'd look you up. Huh, faces don't look so good to me. Let's do some surgery. Bring the plastic, boys. I'll be right with you, fellas, but I remember I got to get these eggs, and I don't mean scrambled either. Mmm, wow, deliver me from temptation. Yes, mmm. Which one of you guys is named Ethelbert? Yeah. Me. So what? I heard you couldn't fight your way out of a beauty parlor. You ought to try fighting your way into one and get that kisser fixed. [laughter] Funny. Who goes by the name of Collins here? I do. What's it to ya? Got a little present for you. You're the new paperboy, huh? Read 'em and weep, kid. [chuckles] That was very considerate of you. You really owe me something now, don't you? And you're gonna get it. [shouting] Hold him, boys. Let go of me, you rats. I'll murder you when I get out of here. Fellas, you got some in his eye. That's not very nice. And you got it all over his nose and mouth. I don't think that's the least bit nice. I don't think so. Now, if you put a little like that-- Aw, don't let it drip down there. Guard! [laughs] Guard! You wanna put some like that. I'll fix you. Get him outta here. Honey boy, I'm giving you the brush. Ah, get outta here. Get out! [laughs hysterically] Oh, is that murder. Funniest thing I ever seen. Oh! [clucking] [Barnes] Hello, Ann. See Collins? Yes. Anything new? They were pounding and pounding at him. Poor boy, he was so ill. Mr. Barnes, isn't there something we can do? His record here, something should prove that he's innocent. I suppose it's because of Danny that I feel this way. He and his brother are so close. I understand, Ann. However, I am quite sure the court will prove his innocence. In the meantime, there's Danny. We've got to break it to him somehow. Let me explain, please, Mr. Barnes. All right, Ann, you do it. I'll do it now. Wait a minute, sit down, Danny. I got things to do. You were planning on leaving, weren't you? Yes, I was. I gotta get out of here. The coppers got my brother Bill. I know, Danny. I was just going to tell you about it. He wouldn't kill nobody. He's a swell guy. Of course he is, Danny. And he'll be all right. I know it. Not with them coppers he won't. I gotta do something to help him. But can't you see? There isn't anything you can do. You won't be helping Bill by breaking out of here. I'm his brother. I know him better than anybody does. They can't make him take the rap for something he didn't do. I won't let 'em. You hear me, I won't let 'em. We're cheering for the same team, Danny. Just between the two of us. ♪♪ [indistinct chatter] You know, this reform-school life is beginning to injure my health. So I said to the guy, "It's a lucky thing--" Hey, Charlie. Get a load of cutie pie saying his prayers. [laughter] Don't pay no attention to those morons. Your brother will make out all right. He's only got four more days. A lot of things can happen in four days. You know, Chalky, gas ain't so bad. Yeah? It's better than the rope. Or the chair. I read in a book once how to get in a daze a week before they go. Can't you guys talk about anything else? Hey, that was an accident. That was an accident, no kidding, no kidding. If I wanted to hit you, I'd wait till you wasn't lookin'. I didn't mean that, I swear I didn't mean it. I-- [all shouting] Come on, get over here. Get over here, will ya? Now shut your traps and go to bed. Hand me that hat. Come on, get to bed. [beds rattling] You shouldn't get in trouble over me. I can take care of it. Yeah, yeah, I know. Look, blood. Pleasant dreams, wise guy. Enjoy yourself. If I was you, I'd call up and order two wheelchairs while I was still able. [yawns] [boys playing] You can't do that, you can't do it! Can't do what? No, you can't, that's out of the rules. Well, what do you mean I can't do that? You don't know how to play fair. Hey, Fins, Fins, I got my fingers crossed. I quit, it's my ball, I quit, nobody plays. I'm going home to my mother. If I wasn't afraid of going to the electric chair, I'd fracture your skull. Go ahead and quit! Danny'll take your place. Come on, Danny, take his place. Leave me alone, will ya, I don't feel like playing. What's the matter? You know what's the matter, I gotta help Bill. I gotta get out of here. Ah, come on, kid, forget it. We need you in the game. Let me go, will ya? I gotta get out of here. Guess he really means it. We better watch him. Looks like the wise guy took over, huh? Yeah. Don't worry about it, that ain't gonna do no good. Ah, lay off, I got it all figured out. I'm gonna slide down that drainpipe and go right out through the tunnel. No breaks. We're on the honor system, remember? Honor system, my foot. They still got Bill. Look, if you wanna make a break, let's all do it together. Don't do it one at a time. You're liable to get caught that way. Hey, maybe they're planning a break. Shh. Great. [knock on door] [Barnes]Come in. Mr. Barnes, I got a little something I wanna tell you. Yes, Charlie? I saw McGinnis and a couple of guys figuring to make a break. You sure they were planning to make a break? Sure, I'm sure, I saw it with my own eyes, didn't I? I'm sorry you told me this, Charlie. Remember, we have an honor system here now. You didn't expect Muggs to tell you, did you? That concerns McGinnis and the institution, Charlie, not you. Aren't you gonna yank him down the carpet? No, I'm not. However, I'm going to have to punish you for informing. Punish me? I only told you what I seen. It's the reason back of it, Charlie, that concerns me. Now, you dislike McGinnis, don't you? Suppose I do dislike him, so what? But Charlie, that's not straight shooting, that's all. Now as a consequence, I'm going to have to take up your recreation privileges for the next two weeks. My recreation-- Well, how do you like that? Muggs pulls a raw deal and I have to take the rap. That's all, Charlie. You may go now. [boys talking at once] You may not know it, bud, but you just struck out. Take the field. Come on, throw that ball and take that glove. Let's go, a little activity here. You mean to say he didn't appreciate your tipping him off? Just like me throwing a pitcher of ice water down his back. I lose my recreation for two weeks on top of that. What? Yeah. He don't like the idea of nobody snitchin'. And, uh, what happens to Mr. Wise Guy? Nothin'. Strike! Strike? Did you ever try seeing an optometrist? I never had trouble with my feet. Huh, never had trouble with you feet. What is an optometrist? An optometrist? An optometrist, it's a-- it's a-- Throw the ball, you're holding up the game. What's the matter with you? Get some water, somebody. Who done it? How many was there? That's all I wanna know. You all right? It was an accident. Who done the accident? Could have been the birds, they kinda dig the summer. What do you think my head is, a carnival target? Could be the missing link. [man] Fight! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me at him, all right, wait a minute. This is all mine, boys, all mine. Come on, Charlie, that a boy. What's the matter, having trouble, Charlie? Nothing I can't take care of, sir. Come on, Charlie, that a boy! Come on, break it up! All of you fight when my back is turned. Your back was turned in the wrong direction, Miller. This guy's always fighting. So you stand by and referee a fight. Look, Miller, when I took over this institution, I was determined to clean it up. There was one rat hole, though, I had trouble in plugging, and now I'm going to stuff you into it. You can't hang nothing on me, Barnes. You've done your own hanging. I'll expect your resignation on my desk within one hour. Come on, boys, get in there. You all right? Yeah, sure, sure, he must've sneaked up on me. "Miller's attempt to spare Collins's life "was made yesterday as counsel for the condemned man "appealed to Governor Walker for a reprieve. "Meanwhile, the date of Collins's execution was set for the 17th." Very interesting. You know, I hate to see that fella Collins go. He's probably a nice fella, the poor sap. Calling me, boss? [Manning] Where are those bourbons? Comin' right up. Here, boss. You know, the fella that should get the chair is Drattler. That ain't nice, boss, even kidding. I suppose you was kidding the night you left me flat. I should've plugged you then. Yeah, that's right, boss, you should've plugged him. What do you mean, plugged me? I mean he should've plugged me-- You should have plugged-- Who started this? Go away,go away. Go on, Dorothy, read some more. Um... "Winners for the Canadian National Sweepstakes were announced late yesterday evening." Hey, I got one of them tickets. Go on, read the winners. "Fat Chance, $10,000, ticket. "$500, Hopeful $6,000, Pride of the Bowery--" I'm Moe. Hey, that's my name. [Knobby] Pride of the Bowery, you're from Jersey. Ticket. Here it is. [man] I get it, you get it. I don't get it. Moe. I don't get it, how come you're part of the Bowery? You're from Jersey. You poor dumb cluck. That's all right, Knobby. I'll take care of you in your old age. Thanks, boss. Ticket. That's right. Here it is. Oh, that's one of them racehorse tickets. Why didn't you say so? Yeah, but you can't collect. They'll grab you the minute they spot you. That's right, I'm drowned. Then you, Drattler. You take it and make believe it's your ticket. Not me. I'm in the same boat. I don't like them reporters and cameramen. I don't look good in pictures. Well, Knobby, I guess you're elected. Oh, I didn't run for nothing. Oh, you want me to collect the five grand. That's right, for me, not for you. Get it? I get it, you get it. I don't get it. Do you think it's safe to trust Knobby with all that money? What else can I do? I can go with him. That's not a bad idea. Go ahead, and don't let Knobby out of your sight, my little one. Don't worry. What makes you think the money would be safe with her? What makes you think it wouldn't? I don't know. Well, if you don't know, keep your yap shut. Ann, you're just what the doctor ordered. Too bad I can't take you on a tour of this place. But I can tell you how swell you are. You're pretty swell yourself. When I was a kid, I always wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. You know, like Sir Lancelot, wearing Lady Guinevere's scarf on my arm. You haven't got an extra scarf handy, have you? No, please. Why, I'm studying cookbooks so I can fatten you up to become a major general, with double chins and double stomachs. You make it all seem so real. It will be real if the man is willing. Remember? Time's up. That's a date, kid. [announcer on radio] Are you nervous and run down? Do you suffer from lack of vitamins? Here's a letter received from one of our listeners. Quote, "Dear Mr. Arnold, a month ago I was nervous. "I chewed my fingernails, jumped when I saw a mouse. "Then I started taking Arnold's tablets. "And you should see me now. "Fit as a fiddle and ready for conscription. Signed Glimpy Stone." Hey, fellas, that's me, I'm the author. [all] Oh! Take it away. Fit as a fiddle and ready for conscription. You can't even spell "conscription." Yeah, someday I'm gonna be a writer. What are you gonna do, write other people's names on checks? [announcer on radio] And now back to the newsroom. Governor Walker today denied a reprieve to Bill Collins convicted on first-degree murder charge. His execution has been set for-- Hey, let's go see some pictures. Mr. Barnes got some swell new pictures. He says we can see 'em if we wanna. Yeah, come on, Danny. Hey, you Gin Rummy players, you wanna see some new pictures? [all shouting] Hey, hey, hey, what's this? What's this all about? Mr. Barnes got some new pictures. He says we can see them if we wanna. Well, ask him the nice way and you can have them. Oh, yes, my good man. Is it being too permissible if we young ones inquest to "perusy" the cinema? Sure-- Cinema? Why, certainly, cinema. Didn't you ever have cinema on your toast in the morning? Button your collar. [laughter and chatter] [Muggs] That guard should go back to grammatic school. Thank you very much. Sit up here, I need to see. [all shouting] Come on, it's a swell picture. I hope. ♪♪ They're not gonna give Bill a reprieve. They're gonna kill him. Ah, what are you talking about? That announcer on the radio was bugs. Listen, I knew a fella one time, he got a reprieve two minutes before they pulled the switch. ♪♪ [announcer] Lady Luck dealt $50,000 to the winners of the Canadian National Sweepstakes. And here's one of the winners now. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the pride of the Bowery who is now $5,000 richer than he was a moment ago. Well, if it ain't Knobby, the lucky stiff. Here you are, sir, and congratulations. Thanks. This is a big blow to me. I mean, this is a lucky-- It's the best thing that ever happened to me. What do plan doing with all this money? I'm gonna give it to the-- I mean, I'm-- uh, uh... Hey. There's our chauffeur. The guy from the truck. Then I'm gonna get my brother-in-law a saloon. We've been needing one of those things for years. Listen, the same old Knobby. Well, what about yourself? What's gonna be your treat? I'll take a scotch and soda. No. [laughs] You mean, what-- I don't need nothing, see. I got a job. What sort of work do you do? What am I doing? He's the guy that stole the truck. Muggs, did you see him open that pack of cigarettes? Yeah, yeah, why? He opened that pack the same way the pack was opened they found in Bill's car. Remember Ann telling us? You mean you think he might-- It's an angle. [Knobby] Dorothy, no. Dorothy's more like a mother to me. What do you want? Hey, Charlie, did you say you knew that guy that won that dough? What's it to ya? Look, Charlie, I didn't come here to argue. Just tell me one thing, did you know him? Yeah, I know him, so what? It means my brother's life, that's what. Your brother's life? What is this, a gag? No, Charlie, this is no gag. It's for real. [boys] Oh, quiet down! Do me one favor, just do me one favor, come outside where we can talk. [whistles] Now, tell us about the guy that won the sweepstakes. Knobby? Yeah. He used to be in my uncle's mob. Uncle? Yeah, Luke Manning. You read about him. Luke Manning, you mean the guy that busted out of Blackwell's Island? He got drowned on the way out, too. He got drowned, huh? I wonder. What do you mean? Listen, if Knobby stole that truck, why did he bring it down the waterfront? Yeah, that's right. You mean that-- I mean that maybe Luke Manning ain't dead. Remember when we went to move that barrel how funny the guy acted? Maybe that barrel wasn't full of wine. Maybe it was Luke Manning in there. I think you got something. I think you're both daffy. Wait till we get in touch with this Knobby. I don't-- Wait a minute, I can give you a lead. Dorothy Melton. Who's she? The dame in the newsreel that took the check from Knobby. Well, she used to be Luke's girl. But I guess Knobby's given it a rush now. Where does she live? She lives in the Carlton Apartments on 3rd Avenue. I used to deliver notes to her from Luke. Danny, looks like we got a date with Dorothy tonight. We can't break out of here. The boss has been too nice. No, but we can tell him everything, now that we got proof that we didn't swipe that truck. We ain't got enough proof. We're going out and get it, and then we'll talk to Barnes. Hey, what do I get for giving you all this info, huh? You wanna get out of here, don't you? Yeah, sure. Well, we're gonna take you with us. You mean it? Gee, thanks a lot, Ethelbert. Wait there a minute, I'll be right back. Come on, fellas. Shut up! We're not waiting till tonight. We're going right now.Good. You know the way, take the fellas. I'll see you in a few minutes. Come on. Ethelbert, huh? Now, Charlie, I'm gonna show you my ingratitude. You mean you got a surprise for me? I got a beautiful surprise. Hey! Hey! Oh! Tell Mr. Barnes about that. [whispers] Look out. ♪♪ A hundred and sixty raviolas for that dress. What's Luke gonna say? Oh, Luke, I needed it, Knobby. Luke won't mind. No, Luke won't mind. Maybe I've lived long enough already anyhow. Your receipt, sir. That'll be $10, $20, $30, $40. And thank you very much. Is there something else maybe I could show you? Oh. Now I've seen everything I-- Well, nearly everything. Hello, honey. [chuckles] What are you doing in-- Knobby! I just want to see if it's imported. What are you doing tonight, honey? Oh, boy, they're coming through the window. It is a lovely evening gown. Well, I'd like to see something in red, you know. Hey, uh, how about dinner for two?

Have you decided to go to the cinema with me? Huh, what do you say? How would you like to see "When Rome Burns, Nero Fiddles"? How about it? What do you say?

Two hundred and-- two hundred-- What's the matter with me? Would you like to see some hats? No! Yes. She's got a hat. She can wear my hat. Now, what type of hat would you like to see?

I'm gonna try this one on. Well, you don't-- How much is that one? Fifty. Well, for a half a smacker, it's okay. Oh, no, $50. $50-- Try this one on again. Maybe if you'd put it on backwards. Knobby, no, this one's adorable. Ah, you look just like a cop in that thing. Well, I'm gonna take this one anyway. Could I show you something in hosiery? Yeah, I'd like to see something. Got a brunette? [chuckles] What do you suppose happened to Knobby? He's had time to go to Philadelphia and back. Yeah, so has Dorothy. I've told you three times to keep Dorothy out of this. The next time I'll-- Okay, okay, I didn't mean nothing. I was just thinking. Don't. If that Knobby has double-crossed me and run off with my five grand, I'll know what to do with him. Call his apartment again. Hey, how do you do, ladies and gentlemen? Eh, refuse me. That is the way she goes. You made up your mind what you want? Yeah, give me some of that-- [mumbles] You don't can't have this. Well, that's what I want. I'm sorry, you don't can have this. This is the proprietor. Well, bring him in, I mean, I don't want-- Well, I'm here and you don't-- Oh, I tell you what. What? How about some nice champagne for the lady? No, she don't want that. You can't spend that.

I don't want no pie. Just a drink, we're gonna drink a lemon-- No-- [mumbling] Do you know what you want? Yes, I know what I want. I came in here for it. Never mind, just bring us two cups of coffee. Mine without cream and sugar. Without cream and sugar for you, yeah. And she wants hers without sugar, but cream and the coffee. Yes. Two cups. Let me see if I got it right. You want black coffee with sugar and no cream, and she wants cream and no coffee and no-- huh? No, she don't want cream with no coffee. Just give her the sugar and put the cream in the coffee.

So am I, only my stomach's wide awake and crying for its bottle. Eh, stop squawking. The hostess is liable to be along any minute. Look, when she comes, let me talk to her. 'Cause when it comes to women, I'm a connoisseur. Just where you belong, in a sewer. You guys know just what to do when she comes? Hey, I think she's coming. Put out that light. Say, this is a swell car. I wonder who owns it. Look, honey, I think you better wait here. I don't think Luke is gonna like this. Oh, Luke Manning, he should have drowned when he beat it out of Blackwell's Island. Yeah, but he didn't. When he finds out that I'm running away with you and his five grand, whoo-hoo. There's only four grand now. Hey, don't, get away from here. Get away from here! Maybe if we give it back to him quick, he won't notice the grand's missing. Look, honey, don't be a fool all your life. We've got four grand. We've got two airplane tickets. By the time Luke finds out, we'll be miles away. Maybe you're right, Dorothy. Cut it out, leave that alone. I'm ticklish, cut it out. No, no, no, I won't, I won't. I'll only be a minute. Take it easy, lady. What are you doing here? I'm a P.L.W. You're a what?

Wait a minute, I'm a friend of Knobby's. Well, that's-- You're what? Knobby, you know. Come on, kid, what's the gag? [Muggs] That's what we came up here to find out. What's this all about? Listen, sister, let's begin at the beginning. If you kids don't beat it, I'm gonna call the cops. Now look, babe. What's the matter, did you forget the number? You don't wanna tangle with the police any more than we do. Take that. Where's your boyfriend? What are you talking about? Your boyfriend Luke, we wanna see him. That's right. You don't have to worry, we ain't gonna hurt you or your place. We're gentlemen from the old school. He means reform school. Reform school? Yeah, that's right. We're friends of Luke Manning's nephew Charlie, Rice Pudding Charlie. I don't know what you're talking about. We just busted out of Wilton, see? Charlie told us if we came up here, his Uncle Luke and Knobby would help us out. Charlie's our pal. Ow! Hello. Hello. Hello, fellas. Say, Dorothy, I've been thinking that-- Who is this? I-- give me that-- where-- give me that-- You looking for this? Yeah, point it at these kids. Hey, you can't do that to me. That's my gun. I'm doing it, ain't I? Is he? I didn't know you had company. These kids broke into here. They said they wanted to see you or Luke Manning. Well, what is it? Uh, what-- Say, seems like I seen these kids before someplace. Yeah, you was running away from the cops. I see you got your wind back. Yeah, I got a-- what happened? Say, what's the matter with you? What are you doing here? This is no time to break into a woman's room, 5:00 in the morning. What do you mean by keeping her out till 5:00 in the morning? Well, it was nothing. We was out shop-- I, uh-- Say, it's none of your business, you hear! What are you doing here, huh? I don't like the looks of this. Why don't you throw them out, Knobby? Yeah, I'm gonna throw them out. They know too much. So do the quiz kids. Well, then I'll throw them out, too. Yeah? Yeah. You ain't going no place, buddy. Ah, that thing ain't loaded. It ain't loaded? No. Look, see, I took the bullets out. Yeah, I forgot I loaded it. Yeah. What am I doing?! Here it is, come and get it. I made 'em myself, here, right now. Uh-oh, no more. [Knobby] I want a cheese. [all talking at once] No, I don't want an egg, I want a lox. Come on, get up out of there! This is no picnic. Now sit down over there. Go ahead! All right, come on, let's hear your story. The one about Goldilocks? Say, how do you do that? Take a load off your feet. Now start talking and no foolin'. [mumbling] [sighs] Did you know it was morning? Sure. I turned the lights off. Why'd you let me sleep for? Get on that phone again. Gee, I called a couple of times already. Nobody answered. Did you or did you not murder that guy in the drugstore? [phone rings] Pick up that phone, I'll break your arm. I'm gonna ask you once more, did you commit that killing? I ain't talking, it ain't legal. That's funny. I could've swore somebody answered that phone. Drattler, maybe you're right. About what? About Dorothy. I think you and me had better pay her a little visit. Now you're talkin'. I hope for her sake she won't be too much surprised, and that goes for Knobby, too. You kids'll be sorry for this. Don't worry your pretty little head about it. I ain't worrying. Oh, you mean-- I know what you are. You're a premeditated killer. I never killed nobody. I'm a bank robber. Bank robber, well, of course that ain't so bad. You're gonna hang by the neck until dead. I don't hang around no place. Why don't you confess and save all this confusion? There's no confusion-- confessing. I know my rights, I'm an American citizen. Did you ever vote? No, who's running? If you didn't vote, you're not an American. You're a man without a country. I am, too, I live in Brooklyn. That's the same thing. Hey, what do you think about the Dodgers dropping the Series? Isn't it tough that Owens dropped the-- [all talking at once] Oh, who's talking about baseball? Hey, what time is it? It's a quarter to 6:00. Don't tell me you can read the time. Well, yeah, for a year now. Hey, Glimpy, grab that phone. Call up Barnes, he'll be in his office by now. Tell him we got one of the guys that committed the drugstore murder. I didn't-- Shut up, you fool. Shut up, you foo-- Oh, you. Oh, I'm sorry, we have nothing new to report. The boys are still missing. No, we haven't sent out a general alarm. I don't believe it's quite that serious. Well, I expect to contact them within the next 24 hours. Yes, I'll call you just as soon as I do. Between Bill and the kids, things are in a pretty bad mess. [phone ringing] Uh, more reporters. I'll tell him you're not in. Oh, never mind, I'll talk to them. They'll call every five minutes if I don't. Hello. Barnes. Warden of The Wilton Reform School. It's the boys. Well, where are you? What are you doing? You sure of that now? Carlton Apartments, ay? You stay right there and we'll be right over. Ann, call the police and have them go to the Carlton Apartments. Tell them I'll meet them there and everything will be all right. Now, don't you worry. Operator, police headquarters, please. If my brother goes to the chair, I'm gonna let you have it. Don't let them scare you, Knobby. I ain't scared. They ain't got nothing on me. Pretty soon now, you can kiss Dorothy good-bye. Why, where am I going? You're not going nowhere. You're staying right here until the undertaker comes for you. No, no, I ain't. Gee, in 20 more minutes he'll be going to the chair. Nineteen. You feel better? Yeah. Now I can face it. I guess you can. Eighteen. No, no. Twenty-five more minutes. Cut it out, will ya? It ain't funny anymore! Take it easy, kid. Everything's gonna be all right. Why don't you do something? They're only kids. He's got a gun, it's loaded. I know, I loaded it myself. I thought you were the kind of man I could go for. What's Luke got that I ain't got? Brains. That ain't nice. I wonder what Luke would do if he was in my spot. [Dorothy] Oh, shut up. I can fix that. [Dorothy] Luke! Get the kid's gun. Now, Knobby, what were you saying about your spot? Nothing, boss. Nothing. Look, I got the dough for you. Look, here it is. New rags, huh? Why, Dorothy, you look beautiful. My cute little double-crosser. [screaming] [smacking] [Dorothy whimpering] No, no, don't hit her, boss. Why don't you pick on somebody your size, jumbo? All right, Knobby, you asked for it. [officer] Come on, get 'em up. So you didn't drown after all, ay? That's too bad. Mr. Barnes, my brother. Where's the phone? Here it is. Hello. Hello, operator. This is Jim Barnes of the Wilton School. Hurry, please. It's a matter of life and death. You'll be mighty proud of your brother before we get through with him. By the way, we just got in 8 carloads of potatoes. Uh-oh. Well, what's he got to do with potatoes? He'll be inspecting them with a paring knife, that is when he's not washing pots, pans, or dishes. Yeah, but I won't mind. No, darling, it'll be good practice. Excuse me, sergeant, but can you tell me where they peel the potatoes? Report to commissary. Okay. Hey, sergeant, what kind of food you got in the guard house? Why, are you expecting to get in there? I'm afraid so, but I don't think I'll mind the food. It's good. I'll fix it up for you. Good-bye, Miss Mitchell. Good-bye. Oh, now don't do anything, please, I mean-- Don't worry, Annie. Oh, be careful. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye, gang. So long. [all shouting indistinctly] Come on, let's go!
