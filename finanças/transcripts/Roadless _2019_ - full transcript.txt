From my understanding, Togwotee means from here, we can go anywhere. It also means where the waters begin. I think it's significant in many ways. There's a lot of layers to the story. Looking back, I guess this idea began the first winter I moved to Jackson. I was exploring, rented a snowmobile at Togwotee Pass, and rode up to the wilderness boundary and looked out. I'll never forget that view. It was like this other dimension of plateaus. It almost looked like layers of clouds. Looking into this wilderness area, it's the most remote place in the lower 48, farthest you can get from any road, and right on the Continental Divide. It's literally the headwaters of the process that has shaped my entire life. It's always had this mystique or this mystery that cultivated this curiosity and just has drawn me to it. I think, like, six years ago, I came out here with Bryan, and we camped and rode this really cool objective, but he was telling me about this wilderness area and he was showin' it to me and these plateaus, and I kept going, "We gotta make this happen, Guch!" And finally, the stars have aligned and let's see where it takes us. - When Guch first asked me to go on this trip, it wasn't a matter of yes or no, it was just a matter of tell me when. Both Jeremy and Guch have had really cool first-time experiences with, so, it's an honor to be able to, like, so many years later, still take that least experienced role with those guys. So, I am super, super psyched to see what we come across. - Oh, my God! Entrenched meanderings begin at the headwaters, away from mechanized life and the rivers of humanity, caught in the swift current of asphalt arteries. We spend most of our lives pulsating through the circulatory system of modern society. In vain, we've become disconnected from our natural world. This is a story of the transfusion of human spirit into wilderness. We know we gotta get this way. Yeah. Do you see us goin' over that saddle, or is it staying north? - No, I think just staying on this elevation, not gaining too much more. Yeah, imagine if underneath where that is... You know, going into this trip, I just would picture wandering slowly through this vast, open landscape, this walking meditation, this sense of infinite time and space. That was like the premise, with no lofty goals, just to go out and to experience that feeling. You've spent a bit of time at home. Has it just been a great, great season out there? We've had a good year. You know, it was tough to get into the back country for a long time, probably similar to here. - Yeah. - Yeah. How about you? I know you're in Alaska but-- I was in BC before that. It was Jackson before that, did the King and Queens thing. Oh, dude, nice work, dude. I love that you won that.

Look at that little splitter, that thing is-- Yeah, both of those. See, they put a scope on it, that thing goes. Wow. Yeah, there's another nice one next to it. Yep. Wow, that sky is unreal. Looks like it's paint, like it's painted. I know. It's gonna have to be. ♪ Into the void, into the void, into the void ♪ We set camp at a little over 10,000 feet at the head of a drainage. As we look at maps and GPS, it really sets in just how vast this wilderness is. Looking how far two full days has taken us, it appears that we have only just arrived inside the perimeter. We've been walking past a lot of great terrain. - The valley could be killer, dude, get down in the trees, more oxygen. There's water. - Water. - Possum, I would say, bears. - Bears. - Bears. - Cuddly critters to play with. I also heard that some grizzly bears are out and I have about 10 pounds of kielbasa sausage in my bag. Wish us luck. - I mean, it's a lotta options. Snowboard, ski with skins, but I'm contemplating ghost riding my sled. I kinda wanna push it pretty hard so I don't have to hike up. Thinkin' it's gonna berm ride. Where is it? Right there, there's a little berm, hopefully not in the air. That is a thing of beauty right there. That is lovely. - Two! One! - Oh, he put some English on it! Hey, it's a new line. Oh, God!

That would've destroyed some shit. Our sleds have really taken their owners. Like, I had a really conservative line. You just punted. - Oh, my God, so sketchy. It's a bummer! Nice line. Nice line. Pretty cool down here! Whole different vibe. And I see water! Boo-ya! Makes our life significantly easier. God, this is amazing. What are we doing? Did you see the takeoff right below that tree? That's so sick, dude. Land, boom, straight into. This is the skate park I've been looking for! The way we eased into it, you know, we found these incredibly fun-lookin' little gullies. Guch called it the skate park, with incredible trannys, gaps, and little doubles.

It is a place to recalibrate our perspective of life, a place to revive, heal, and strengthen the mind, body, and soul. Vivid memories of the past and future insights are realized in this rich state of consciousness. Dude, I was havin' one of those half-dreams this morning, and it was all, like, hangin' out with some natives, showin' 'em Google Earth. No way. And then, somehow, later in that dream, Craig Kelly showed up in it. - That's awesome. That's so bizarre that both of you woke up thinkin' of Craig, 'cause if you think of Craig's path in snowboarding, we've been on a similar path that he like laid out, basically, the playbook for it. - Absolutely. - Yeah, learnin' a bit through people that knew him, it has that element, I have that element of gratitude right now that some semblances of what I'm able to do, and it be-- - Acceptable. - Accept that that is a path and part of it. - When I came on to the Burton team, he was just finishing up competing. He really embraced us younger riders, like Terry, myself, invited us to his home, take us out on the mountains. That was, like, such a far world. Terry and I's contest, like, let's. That was the be-all, end-all. - Yeah, that was it, you know, but then Craig was like, "Hey, check this out." And just blew my mind with the mountains and the freedom that's out there. ♪ Am I going up ♪ Am I going down I actually looked to Craig as, like, a father figure. I mean, I've grown up without a father. He was really educated, such a smart human being, very conscious, and he was the first person that came into my life that I looked at as a role model. I grew up surfing and skateboarding in Southern California. I think when I got outta high school, it was a time where I had freedom and just kinda was tryin' to pave a way in this world, find a life in the, you know, I went up to the mountains, and it was such a new experience. And you know, after competing and beating myself up in the parks, I was like, man, this isn't really sustainable for me, physically. I was just injured a lot. It was kinda bummin' me out in life. Started riding backcountry with Craig, and started spending more time riding powder. That's when I really fell in love with backcountry snowboarding and it set my path, I think. ♪ Am I going down He just brought me into it, brought me into the backcountry, and brought me into these trips where we were going out with guides and riding these amazing places. You know, I'd been doing contests and going trip to trip, but that didn't feel like snowboarding to me. That was just like this crazy machine, kinda like go here, go there, do this, do that, jump, monkey, dance. And spending time with Craig, that was some snowboarding. That was the dream for me. ♪ I don't wanna wait too long ♪ While I'm buried in the ground ♪ - He was just doin' so much cool stuff, like, goin' on these adventures and havin' a big vision of what the future of snowboarding could be. - Well, and he did that from, like, a career standpoint. It looked like a horrible move. I remember, 'cause we were friends, watchin' you move to Jackson, and from a career standpoint, you're like, you can't be a pro snowboarder at Jackson Hole. - That was a total Craig-inspired move. - Right? Frickin' beautiful day in the mountains! It really is. Not a car, not a plane. Just us and some animals wakin' up. Yeah. How psyched are they to see the sun after-- There's definitely some bears that are gettin' dripped on in their little caves, just like, this warmth. - I'm almost wondering if we should go that way. Valley that we're interested in, similar aspect to this, so we dug a pit. Pit actually looks good, but right across the way, we do see a pretty nasty natural avalanche. But in general, the snow feels good. It's just more seein' the naturals that has me on my toes a little bit. As we started to dig into the snow pack, we really have been likin' what we've been seeing. We haven't been able to get anything move. We've had a lotta good pit results, and it's kind of startin' to look like it's just game on out here. Here he comes. Yeah! Yeah, Guch! Walkin' back to camp, I thought about how we all ended up here. Guch, the most unlikely, born in the suburbs of L.A., first touched snow at 15. Superstar by 21, at 26, he spit out of the fire, landing in Jackson, the first Jackson Hole pro. The industry didn't see it. Dropped from his sponsors led to cooking by 30, but he was always riding. The spotlight finding him again when he was 35, but now on his terms. Rice is more obvious. Born on the best mountain in the world, he exploded on the scene at 16. Sharing the same sponsor, I really had a front row seat. A fired-up kid ready to break barriers every run, every day. - Juices everything below that, huh? - Yeah, I agree. Myself, Cape Cod born. Showed up to my first race with no expectations and won. Two years later, I turned pro at 16. I was just good enough to feed myself and see the world, a passport to the great ranges, but my true love has always been free riding. 20 years later, here we are. - Well, me and my little buddy, we're gonna cruise down valley. Go do some boardin', find a camp spot, have a civilized lunch, sip from the headwaters, this magical tributary. Diggin' this travel. Oh, yeah, that's right, we have a dog. - You know, I don't remember the exact first moment, but my earliest memory that stuck of Travis was the day of his high school prom. And we had built this quarter pipe jump. Watching him ride that day was one of those sessions that was a full breakthrough. He was doin' tricks that I'd never seen. That was mind-blowing enough, but he was goin', like, two to three times bigger than Lance, and Lance went bigger than anybody at that point, you know, that time in snowboarding. Growin' up in Jackson Hole, I was really extra aware of the Jackson Hole snowboarding community at that time, individuals like Lance Pitman, Bryan Iguchi. These were the people that we really looked up to. Guch was a pop culture icon. It wasn't just that he was a good snowboarder. He was a trendsetter. He had this life experience of traveling the world, competing, won some of the biggest contests. He was one of, if not the coolest guy in snowboarding. ♪ No And so, first time that I really got to go build jumps, use snowmobiles, it really blew my mind quite open. And I was probably kind of oblivious to it at the time, but it had an effect. There was a level of respect and appreciation into the process of how we were operating in the backcountry, and just what it meant to be out there. Jump! ♪ I don't know, man ♪ I looked in the mirror, hands on my lips ♪ ♪ Man, I pray the jonesin' - And I remember him, at the end of the session, sitting on a snowmobile, callin' his limo driver, gettin' everything down for a sick night of partying. I was like, man, this kid has got it goin' on. Man, this is so awesome! And then, sure enough, the next day after the prom, he heads to Superpark, and the rest is kinda history. This is so cool. I'm so glad this is a reality. Yeah, totally! And this is, like, such an ancient form, you know? Inuits were doing this. Yeah. Seal skins, toboggans. Just the ability to see this land in such a pure form is really special. Wow! Heck, it's interesting, 'cause there was probably more traffic through that pass 1,000 years ago than there has been in the last 200 years. And that's what pure wilderness is. - Can't walk past a cave, man, spelunking. It's in the genes. Beautiful elk skull. The best part is just how nibbled it's been by some big carnivore. Just chew toy, elk skull chew toy. Right? See the burnt log? Someone took refuge in here. Yup. I love the way the ice formed, trickle behind. Let's put it back where we got it. Put it back in here. Or you want to leave it as an omen? Crown jewel. - Jones, I had this bag on my Deeper trip. I was thinkin' that right now. That's pretty special, man. - Did it snow? The trip that I did with Jeremy for this film, Deeper, you know, I had a fair amount of experience, probably spent eight years in Alaska, and it had all been through mechanized approaches, and never camping. And so, having the opportunity to really go super deep and get dropped off, and really get immersed in these weather and solar cycles day to day, it's hard to put it into words what I got out of that trip. I just found so much solace. Sure is pretty up here. ♪ Is gonna be a while, but I'll be back some day ♪ The happiest I've ever seen him was on Deeper, 25 days in the hole. Supposed to go out for seven. It's in his blood. Seed gets planted in him, watch out. Yes, dude! All time, dude, all time. You know, we really just scratched the surface, but I left there knowing this is where I'm goin' with my snowboarding. This is where I belong. One of the most incredible views I've ever seen, and this is really the start of the unknown, and it's startin' to be known. I saw Jeremy bein' floored that something that he had ideated, worked on, obviously spent years thinking about, I mean, that's the most beautiful thing on earth, is someone taking an idea and putting it into action. For me, it was beautiful to be a part of it, and see Jeremy realize a vision. I'm stoked to do a little sunset. Those things are so inviting. Yeah, me too. This is kind of the good entry, anyway.

Yeah, that's where we wanna go. We should just pound it out. Yeah. When did you do Denali? Um, like, the year we did the Grand. Oh sick! Was it after? Yeah. Right on. Thinkin' back, man, wow! Everything came together. Yeah, not runnin' back to it. No, not runnin' back, no. I looked at it every day and I liked the view. Totally! Doing any kind of mission with Jeremy is no joke. I mean, I'm always gripped before we do something together. But having him reach out to me really meant a lot. He's someone that is always motivating me to push myself and dig deep to have these experiences, you know? I wouldn't have done it without him. It's real. The Grand has gotta be one of the most complex lines I've ever climbed and snowboarded. I mean, that's the most exposed I've ever been, and for all the conditions to come together just perfectly, it's magic, and it just felt right. Oh, top of the Grand, long time in the making. You know, whenever I think about that trip, I think of hanging out above the repels, when you guys were down finding the anchor-- Oh, yeah! And I was just by myself for so long, just hanging out, like, looking at the valley, just so much space underneath and above. No man's land. Yeah, it was such a wild feeling. Really happy to get on these final repels. Whoa! Whoa! All right, let's talk about it down there. The mountains are still talkin' to us. You know, the Grand Tetons was, by far, the most ambitious snowboarding objective I've ever done, and probably will ever do, to be honest. I could say that I'll never do anything like that again, but maybe I will. Let's go zip it up before you totally-- Yeah, yeah, do that for sure. I'm, like, quarter of a person right now. Yeah! The wilderness reveals stark contrasts between life and death. Seeking moments of solitude and bliss can lead you to face your deepest fears. Remember that big arch they road up in? - Yeah. I find, when I'm out here, I think about friends that I've lost. - Yeah. - Especially, like, in those dark starts, just because I just think of how psyched they'd be to be out here. And then, when you get through the less-than-optimal moments, whether it's just puttin' cold boots on, or whatever, or like, the early wake-ups, it's like, wake up an hour earlier, we're lucky to be alive and be able to do it. Mm-hmm. In 2003, we were ridin' in the backcountry, and Tristan Picot, a 19-year-old French snowboarder who I'd just met that morning had a small avalanche and he went through trees, and it killed him. You know, I was the first one to him. I had never experienced a loss of life and such tragedy. Snowboarding brought me the best feelings I've ever experienced, and that day was absolutely the worst. And I was a mess for weeks. And my phone started blowin' up at, like, six in the morning, and it was Ari Marcopoulos. Picked up the phone, he was like, "Have you heard?" I'm like, "Heard what, man?" He's like, "There's been a big avalanche in Canada "and Craig passed." And I just was, like, in shock, man. I didn't know if I was ever gonna ride again. I didn't know if I was gonna stay here. I didn't know if I was gonna run home, my family in California, what I was gonna do, 'cause I was just depressed, like nothing I'd ever felt. And that day, I was like, think I have to go snowboarding today, man. I think I have to get back out there. I think Craig would want me to continue on. And from that day forward, it's like I'm gonna step it up with my passion and love for the sport and do it responsibly. I don't know how many days I'm gonna be on this planet, but I wanna make sure I enjoy every opportunity and do it the best I can. Cheers, man. See you at the bottom. All right, drop it! - It's a healing thing, you know? It's transformative to be out there, connect, and just meditate over the love that you feel for these people that are no longer with us, but they're always gonna be with you. What's cool is that there's just so much variation, so many different types of riding. It's really just like a snowboarder's paradise. Easy valleys to travel and gorgeous flanks to snowboard down.
