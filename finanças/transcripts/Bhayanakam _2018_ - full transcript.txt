Subtiles exclusively arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain "Bhayanakam" (Fear) Is Konnoth Kadavu still far ahead? It is across. 10 coss away. Alright. Who is it there? At this hour! Is it you, Chendhan? Stay right there. Who are you? Never seen you around... I'm the new postman. The one before me said that I may find a place to live here. How will you manage with this leg? What happened actually? First World War. I was in the Army. Got shot, on the knee. Please, come in. Why don't you sit inside the house! What's important is that you survived. Have you been to Kuttanad before? No. This is the first time. All the lads around here are joining the Army now. Both of my sons too - Vasudevan and Krishnan. Both of them? Yes. Both smart young lads. Let me make a coffee for you. Maybe I will leave... Leave to where? The previous postman too lived in a room here. You can keep your bags inside. I will be back soon. 120, 121, 122, 124, 125, 127, Hey! Come here. Is my crippled leg the source of amusement? Hmm... Do you know how this happened? Maybe you fell from a height. Well, do you know where all those lads standing in line are heading to? Well, we are on our way to enlist Mani in the Army. Ah. And what after joining the Army? Will fight in the war. And what then? Will win the war. What if you don't win? Will lose... And if it's neither, this is what happens. Hey. Hey. Ok. Next. Go that way. Next. [ Calls out for attention ] [ Stranger acknowledges the call ] Can you direct me to Cheerathe Gopalan's house? Can you direct me to Cheerathe Gopalan's house? Row southward for a while. There is writing too. If you could read it... "I am doing fine here... Sending you some money hereby; spend only when needed. Your son, Vasukuttan." If his letter arrives, do bring it at the earliest, Postman. Today is a Monday, right? There might be one on Thursday. I will see to it. Make way, kids. I want to buy something for Onam. I too want to. Clear off. There are other important matters here. Firstly, I have to plaster the house... Hey. Which is Paruthikaata Paily's house? The one with the copra farm? The address says Paruthikaata Paily. Yes, the same one. The farm is right in front of his home. Alright. Postman uncle! Have you seen an aeroplane? Have seen it. Have felt it with my hand too. What happens in a war? Who fights in it? Well, it's the soldiers who do the fighting. But if you ask me who they are fighting for... I will explain later, kids. First let me deliver this Money Order. I won't sign! As if his money is needed to meet ends here. I got no time for this. He went on his own accord, didn’t he? Why are you fuming about it? I'm sweating out in this copra farm. He could have stayed and be a helping hand. But he absconded and joined the Army. Who is at loss? This lady here will never understand that. It's an Allotment Money Order. What should I do now? In that case, is it enough that I sign it? Yes, that will do. You are the mother, after all. Turn. Turn it the other way. Yes... right here. "Jaanamma, Veluthedath Veedu" Shall I read it out? Yes, please. "To my dear mother and Sarojini..." Isn't my name the next, Postman uncle? You wish! It will be mine. Brother likes me the most. Silence, you both. Let him read... So listen now; both of you lost the case, and both of you won it too. It's written as "and the children". No it's not. It must be my name. "By the grace of God, I'm fine. Onam is next week, right? We don't celebrate it here. But at home, do ask Sarojini to take part in arranging the flower carpet this time. Do buy new dresses for everyone. Make sure the children study hard. My regards to the neighbours Kunjan and Pappu. I will send some money soon. Hoping everyone is doing fine. Your son, Gopalan." What's there to cry for! Hmm? Here, take it. How many houses did you deliver to, by noon? Around 20, I think. Vasudevan had taken my consent before leaving. He went along with two of his friends for the recruitment. But only Vasudevan got selected! It was a few months later, Krishnan didn't return home one night. Not even the next day. Goodness! Where am I supposed to go search for him, all alone? And then a letter arrived. I made the neighbour Govind read it. It said Krishnan too joined the Army. He was apparently anxious that I wouldn’t have allowed him to leave. Do they send money? Yes, of course. But I never spend it. I keep depositing it in the Post Office. After all, when they return, there should be some savings here, isn't it? Hmm, yes. But, to have them close-by is what I will call 'savings'. [ Postman calls out to stranger ] [ Stranger acknowledges ] You have a post. A letter. Listen, I have laid out the sleeping mat in your room. I'm off to sleep. Ok. - [ Boatman's call in the background ] Will you be back early on Thursday? Yes, on Monday and Thursday. I'll leave now. Kunju! The postman is here for you. When will my grandson be back, Postman? I wouldn't know that. How will the postman know that? Here, have some coffee. Is it the postman there? Yes. Ask him if there is any money for us. Postman uncle, is there any post for Karuthedath? Karuthedath, is it? Perhaps on Monday. Onam is next week. That's why I was asking. I understand. If it's on the way, you'll receive it on Monday. When will my grandson be back, Postman? He'll be back, alright? Don't worry about it. - Postman! - Yes? When will my grandson be back? He'll return. Alright? Alright. Kalyaniamma! [ Calls out again ] Oh, it's you. I was wondering who could it be. I had been to your home. The children said you were at the temple. Yes, that's where my routine begins. I have to do the chores too, at the temple. And then I return home with the offerings. There's an Allotment Money Order, for you. Is it? Has it reached? Thank goodness! Yes. Please sign here. Why the tears? Shouldn't you be happy? It's out of joy... Hmm. It's with this money that I have to marry off my younger daughter. The marriage had been fixed a month ago, but it wouldn't take place without the money. The Gods will bless you, I'm sure. I'm not lending my money; it's from the Army. This is just my duty. Still and all, you carried it to me, from my son who is in some faraway land. [ Continues to sob ] Postman! Yes? We had just started our journey. And we couldn’t have hoped for a better good luck charm than you. Now the matter will be auspicious, without doubt. Yes, indeed. Now, the address was of no help. How am I supposed to locate you, if you are never at home? This farm is my home and my address. My fate is nothing but the fate of the landlord's farm. Is my son doing well, Postman? Where is he now? Only God knows his whereabouts. Pray well for him. That's all that I pray. You! Isn't your mealtime over yet? Now rush to the farm! [ Hymn on the importance of a master ] Psst. Please come here, Postman. Do you bring any news of my son? His father wouldn't approve, that's why I summoned you here. You are new here, isn't it? Yes. That's why. Should I read it out for you? No, thanks. The children will read to me, without his notice. Now when you are here to deliver money, come straight to the kitchen, alright? Hmm. He was the only son. That's why the father is scornful. "To my mother, father, Mary, her husband, Isaac, the little one, our calfs-" I'm off to the field. His list of names seems unending. Why are you so resentful? Can't you just hear it out? You stay back and listen. If the landlord arrives before the ploughing is over, I'll be doomed. You read it out aloud. Let him hear it too. "By God's grace, I'm doing fine. Did it flood there, this year?" Ah! Only the flood remains to be endured! "Onam is next week, isn't it? "Does father still-" "Does father still get drunk and beat up mother?" Now! Now! How does he know of it? You must've told him. Now don't make assumptions! What if I do? Give that to me. Leave me. Today I'll sort you right. [ Altercation continues ] Kochuthangedathi, you there? Why you making a ruckus? Rush now. Ponnamma is in labour pain. Come fast. What's the matter? The pain began long ago. It seems the baby is stuck. You need to rush. Alright, go on. I'm behind you. Alright. Quick. Coming. Faster... Faster... Run along. Yes, yes. Listen, there is money for you. I'm heading that way now; I'll collect it there. Someone is in labour pain. Listen, don't go away. I have other deliveries. I'll collect it there. This delivery is more important. Follow us now. Don't sprint; I can't even run. You come as you please; I'll be there. Run along, now. Slow down. Come fast. Just sign and then go. Everyone run along. Why is everyone running? What happened? Someone is in labour. The vault of heaven has bloomed, Dispelling dark petalous clouds. The vault of heaven has bloomed, Dispelling dark petalous clouds. Dark petalous clouds, Like the deep curls of her hair. These strips of land will embrace the rains that pour. And the reminiscence of her hair is all that I ask for. A strip for the sesame. A strip for the sesame. A strip for the flowers. A strip for the Lords. And a strip for the departed. He's singing to her. He leaves for the Army tomorrow. How did you become a Postman? Have you heard of the First World War? Yes, yes. Many died in that war, isn't it? Hmm. Someone mentioned it recently in the library. Hmm. There is nothing definite in the war. Anyone can die, anywhere, anyway. When the battle ended, I happened to be alive. Everyone in the vicinity were killed by the blasts. Everyone except me. And thus, I became a Postman. He knows a song about aeroplanes. Sing it. Who? This Kunjan here. Then Kunjan will sing it out, won't he? Here comes the German, spurting and twisting, moving like a fireball. Here comes the German, spurting and twisting, moving like a fireball. Going up, piercing the skies. Look up! Is it the Grim Reaper? Or a plane? Look up! Is it the Grim Reaper? Or a plane? Here comes the German, spurting and twisting, moving like a fireball. Going up, piercing the skies. Who taught you this song? My father. He's in the Army now. Hmm. - Hail the soldier. - Hail the soldier. I was wondering where you've been. Didn't get the Bell Flowers, though. Someone must've plucked it early in the morning. Even though the lads aren't here, I celebrate every festival. In fact they are the ones who insist on it, in their letters. "Even if we aren't around, you should always stay cheerful. " They say. Do they celebrate Onam while in the Army? There is no festivity while in the Army. One feels more than satisfied merely knowing the day of the week. We wouldn’t have been celebrating if not for you! [ Smiles ] Will you visit us on Onam? Do come. There will be porridge. I will try to be there. I may be at Thakazhi... It's the Postman. Good luck charm again! Wait till the toddler grows up; you'll be paid in gratitude. Hurry up, now. Coming, coming. "Salem Modern Theatres presents, the first Malayalam film - Balan... " Throw us one. One here, please. A leaflet for me too. It's delicious. Prepared with taro root and butter milk. It's called Asthram. Doesn't Asthram mean 'arrow'? This too is an arrow. A tasty one. Coral jasmines have a peculiar scent, don't they? Hmm. Honestly, I have never noticed it. For me, the odour of burnt gun powder seems to linger forever. And of human flesh. But the war is long over. I think you should notice other things in life, like the flowers blooming or the birds chirping. You are right, but I feel my ears have deafened over time. It's said that if one sleeps with these flowers beneath their pillow, they'll dream of the person they love. They're named Manoranjani. My dreams are always about war. Go on then, tell me the chronicles of war. When dreading about the incoming bullets, what were your thoughts? As you fired seamlessly at the enemy, what were your thoughts? As you walked over the dead and the wounded, when their cry for help pierced your ears, what were your thoughts? Gaurikunjamma... Oh my! Look at you. I was startled. Did you hear of it? The war has begun. My goodness! Please, keep my lads safe and well. It's bigger than the First World War. Pray well... Where are you going now? I have to go. It's begun - the announcements of the dead. Is Kizhakethara Kali home? I'm here. There's a telegram. It's about your son. My son! [ Wailing continues ] Money came early this month? It's not money; there's a telegram. Your son was killed in the war. [ Wailing begins ] Is it for real? Is the telegram for us? [ Wailing continues ] Please wait. There's a telegram. [ Lady whimpering ] Don't dare touch me. Not after killing my son! To hell with your telegram. You'll feel my wrath, all your life. Has he sent money, Postman? War has begun. It's a telegram; your son won't return. What did you just say? He won't return? How dare you say that! Leave me! [ Lady begins to whimper ] How many telegrams were there today? Five or six, I think. I'll leave soon. Why not wait till the morning? I can't. These are telegrams; they can't be kept waiting. And there are more numbers for the village across. You didn't finish it. I'm done. [ Indistinctive news report on radio ] Heard it? They say Italy too has joined. This is not going to end anytime soon. 'Second World War', after all. We are short of food supplies, master. You need not drool over my granary. Go get the raw rice from the ration stores. You can eat that. You were friends with Antony's son, weren’t you? Yes. Army recruitment, isn't it? Death recruitment, I'd call it. It was only yesterday that the news of your friend's death arrived. Yet your mother let you join the Army? Any mother will agree, when the family is struck with hunger. Next - Step back. - Sir, my family is starving. - No way. Step back now. - Please let me join, Sir. Take him away. Sir... Please... Next Pray that nothing happens. Will he be able to get away from the war and return home? If he tries to get away, it won't be the enemy who kills him. It will be his own men. That's the rule of thumb in a war. All that I wish for, is a glance. When inside a trench, a soldier sees only the sky. The very sky that you see from here. The same moon shines on me, As it does on you. Have you known? The very night sky watches over me, As it does over you. Have you known? The very night sky... The same moon... Magically, for you and me. As I scooped the moon, Your face shone in my hands. How far are we from each other, Yet, so close. Oh moon! Shining on you. Shining on me. Shining on us. Vasudevan... Expired... Oh God! Just because of all that's happening, you shouldn't take it upon yourself. Look at you! Completely dishevelled. So much for all that grit and glory. I think you were lying about having fought the war. Because you have a soft heart. How can one wage a war with this? My Vasudevan is far more bold and strong. It's raw rice. Been wandering around searching for supplies. In vain. You needn’t have taken the pain... Where did you deliver today? There were many... I think I should sleep now Feels exhausted - Finish your dinner. This war... is like a wildfire. Vasudevan and Krishnan are both competent. I'm sure they can survive any war. Oh my! Here, drink some water. What happened? You haven't eaten much. I'm done. It's the money they sent over, last time. Please deposit it in the Post Office. Here... There was a letter from your elder son. Really? Where is it? I forgot about it. Please read it out for me. "To my dearest mother." "From Vasudevan." "By God's grace, I'm doing fine here." "I hope you are well too." "The war has begun." "Things have changed, but there is nothing to panic." "We hear about soldiers dying," "but we are in a safe..." "...we are in a safe zone." The money may be delayed this month. Perhaps my next letter too. Krishnan is also at a safer post. Do not worry about anything, mother. Stay happy. Yours truly, Vasudevan." How do I stay happy without my sons? At least he was able to write to me, in between the chaos. Krishnan is also fine. Didn't I tell you, they're both smart and able. Will you write a reply for me? Well... You know... It won't deliver to him. We don't have an address. We don't know where he is. They keep moving every day. That's how the war progresses. It's alright then. We'll write later, in that case. Hmm. I wonder where he is, my Vasudevan... And my Krishnan... In which country... [ Indistinctive wailing ] Is Kalyaniamma here? The one who does the chores here... Yes, it's her daughter's wedding today. Come have lunch with us. It's my daughter's wedding. You had given me the money for it. It's alright. I have many deliveries on the way. I better keep moving. But it's a joyous day for my daughter. And you are like a son to me. Hmm. Come now. Kalyaniamma. What is it? It's a telegram. [ Wailing ] At least it didn't arrive yesterday. Thanks to the Gods. [ Call out ] Can you direct me to Pattathra Gregory's house? [ Call out ] Can't you just say it? Can I get some water, please? No... [ Begins to wail ] What happened, mother? What is it? What happened? This is all because of you. Are you content now? My fate is to lead the funeral of my son... Oh God! Nobody is dead! There is no telegram. It's a Money Order. Money? Here, take it and sign. Postman uncle, which one is the bigger war - the earlier one or the current one? The growing number of telegrams indicate that this one will be more widespread than the earlier one. How many Postman uncles are there around the world? Countless, I suppose. What is the war for? God knows why! No one else knows neither the one who kills, nor the killed. The lads here are jobless and end up starving. So they resort to the Army for a job, without the slightest idea about war. This land hasn't seen one either. Not even heard a gunshot, for that matter. No one has stood eye-to-eye against the enemy. Then why don't we write to my father and ask him to return? How do we know his whereabouts? Who will deliver it to him? And where? Even if it reaches him, how can he read it, with fire raining over him? If everyone is dying, who is going to benefit from this war? You're right. At times I feel all these should be told to the world. But who will say it? And to whom? Ittiyoppa... What is it? A telegram for you. A telegram. Get lost, bastard. My son won't die. He won't die. Oh God, it's a telegram! [ Begins to wail ] It's not a telegram! What is it? What happened? There's no telegram. I was just seeking a shelter from the rain. Rascal! You are here to stir panic. Go rot in the graveyard. [ Wailing continues ] Is there a show running here? Shut up now. And you, don't even linger around here. Hey there, Postman. One moment, please. You are Thalapelayan, aren’t you? Yes, I am. What is it? I don't need my son's money or letter. And don't deliver the telegram either. I'll be content thinking he is alive somewhere. Hmm. I'm covered in filth... Postman! When will my grandson be back? I heard the boats can go up to Pulickal now. Is it? Well, we have a bad omen here. Let's scrap the plan and head back. I agree. "Konnoth Krishnan... Expired." I knew you'd be early tonight. Hmm. Krishnan's money arrived today. That can wait. Why don't you freshen up first? What is it? I've never seen this state of yours. And there goes the light! Why did you blow it off? Darkness is more comforting. We can sit across, without seeing each other. Just hearing the voices. Now you're being spiteful. What is it? All those wailings from hundreds of houses... They're ringing inside my head. Where has the war reached? It has reached inside this bag now. The Second World War. It may be happening in some faraway land, but all the dread about it is contained in this bag of mine. Darkness is better. Much better than your scary antics. Postman! Postman! [ Wailing continuously ] I saw the telegram just now. Is it true? Is my son dead? Why don't you kill us too? [ Continues to wail ] Goodness! You poured hot water on yourself? Here, I was going to make it warm. Give it here. Who pours hot water on themselves? What has gotten into you, lately? Cooked vegetables, coconut chutney, pickled mango curry... It's all here. Go on, eat now. Does it not taste good? It's good. Really good. Then why aren't you having it? You didn't even have a morsel. I really don't know. Feeling abstinent. Krishnan has sent more money than usual this time. What's the use of just money. I long to see them... God knows where they are... You've been strange, lately. Nothing. Nothing at all. Don't lie to me. Something is definitely wrong. You walk as if burdened by something. Yet, you won't share it with anyone. You didn't sleep at all, last night. Neither did you. Don't know why, my heart is pounding. Mine too... While we are asleep here, will my sons be awake in the lands they are in? And waging war? There is no sleep there. Day or night. It's one and the same. Today is Krishnan's birthday. And he loves this milk porridge. Have some before you go. I haven't taken a bath. So let me leave... Do come early on Thursday. What is it? Are you crying? What happened now? Each time I leave from here, I'm burning inside... "KONNOTH KRISHNAN EXPIRED." "KONNOTH VASUDEVAN EXPIRED." The winds of Kuttanad enquire... The shores of Vattakayal wonder... The adrift boats ask... Won't they return? Won't they return? How can you fall? When you are moulded from earth! When you are the sons of Karumady! How can you fall? When you are moulded from earth! When you are the sons of Karumady! No! You are immortal... And we shall remember... The winds of Kuttanad enquire...

All along these strips of land, Golden rain trees await the bloom... The hands pleaded for morsels... Yet, why are they greeted with fire? The winds of Kuttanad enquire...
