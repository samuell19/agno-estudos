To Whom: Mihail Potapovich Clubfoot I worked all year, and not in vain - It's time I hit the road. The last page of the calendar Is there upon the wall. The last page of the calendar Is there upon the wall. So that the New Year Tree may be Appropriately styled, With toys aboard I hit the road, A gift for every child. With toys aboard I hit the road, A gift for every child. Hey, squint-eyes, squint-eyes! It's me - Grandpa Frost! Come here! - You... Ooh, you frightened me Grandpa! To tell you the truth, I almost died of fright! To Where: Dense forest. To Whom: Mihail Potapovich Clubfoot - Why're you knocking here? He-he! Can't you read the sign? "Do not wake up... until... summer." Summer... But what is "summer"? - Oh my! You don't know summer? How ignorant! You don't know summer! Oh! It was in the summer, The summer It was in the sultry summer. Upon the scorching pavement, In front of the old garden I waited for a meeting under the clock... - My dear man... what is "summer"? - Oh, an actor! What an actor! - "Grandpa Frost!" "He's here!" "Grandpa Frost came!" - Hello, dear children! Hello! Happy New Year! Here are your gifts. - Thank you! - Thank you! - Thank you! - Grandpa, will you come to us in the summer too? - Dear kids, tell this old man, what is this "summer"? - Summer? It is... This is what the summer is: Summer is clad in bright green, Summer is warmed by the hot sun, It breathes the summer breeze. La-la-la, la-la-la, La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. La-la-la, la-la-la, La-la-la-la-la, la-la. In the green, sunny meadow Green frogs jump. And butterflies are dancing, And all is blossoming all around! - Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Ah-ah-ah! What a shame! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! - Would you like me... to sing you a song? It goes like this... In the green, sunny meadow Green frogs jump. And dance... And dance... What comes next? Darn it, I forgot the words! A green, melancholy yearning descends on our old man. - Ain't that something! The old man's cooled on winter! Oh. - How ignorant! You don't know summer! This is how he... he painted me! Into the bag put him! Into the bag! - What an actor! A fir tree was born in the wood, And in the wood it grew... - Grandpa, where are you going? - Oh, I'll go, I suppose, and see summer! My strength has gone! - The old man has... ...lost his mind! We are on the road with a summer song, The best song in all the world! We may meet a hedgehog in the wood. It's good that the rain has passed! La-la-la, la-la-la, La-la-la, la-la-la. - What happened? Do you know what happened? - Why are you breaking the law? - Mister policeman! - Mister policeman! This is our Grandpa Frost! - Who allowed this? Frost is supposed to come... when?... In Winter! And what season do we have now?... Summer! Can't you see? I... wanted to see the summer. But I've seen nothing yet. Our Grandpa is sick! A doctor! Get a doctor! - Eh... it's all clear. The patient is eh... melting down in front of our very eyes! It is absolutely necessary to send him to the north! - So Grandpa Frost never will get to see the summer? - Out of the question! - But he so wanted... to see the summer! - Quiet! Hush! Here... have an ice cream. Just... stop crying! - I know how we can help Grandpa Frost see the summer! We must give him our ice cream! - That's right! Right! Here, Grandpa! Grandpa, here you are! Here you are! - Well, h... how do you feel? - Excellent! - Hurrah! Hurrah! We are on the road with a summer song, The best song in all the world! We may meet a hedgehog in the wood. It's good that the rain has passed! La, la-la, la-la-la, La, la-la, la-la-la, We are covered with a bronze tan Berries in the forest are red and ripe. Not for nought is summer warm - Summer's a good thing! La, la-la, la-la-la, La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, La, la-la, la-la-la, La-la-la, la-la, la-la! - Oh, who is this? Oh! Who is this? What is that? Oh, who is this? - Cuckoo! Cuckoo! - Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! - Cuckoo! - Cuckoo! - "Cuckoo! Cuckoo!" Well, what's with all the cuckooing? It's time to go home, and you won't stop cuckooing! - Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But, you're right! It's time! Here you are, Grandpa! Grandpa, here you are! Here you are! Thank you! Thank you! - Thank you, dear children, for showing me the summer! I... I'm - the happiest Grandpa Frost in the world! - Hurrah! Attention! I was the children's guest this summer And saw with my own eyes The forest green, the gardens green and the green grass as well. The forest green, the gardens green and the green grass as well. On the road the sun burned me, I was melting from the heat. Back to the North I take the warmth and all the children's smiles! But to the North, I take the heat and all the children's smiles!
