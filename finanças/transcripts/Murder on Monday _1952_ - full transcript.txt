For heaven's sake,please,what is it? What happened to you? Where have you been? Where I've been? In the office of course, where do you think I've been But last night and all of today But Janet,darling I never saw you like this before If you didn't feel well why didn't you ring me at the bank You only had to phone and I'd come straight home I've been in torment all day and all last night I thought I was going mad All last night? What do you mean all last night? And you didn't come home Janet,dear Look,look at the clock up there, it's just gone seven I'm always home at seven every evening There is nothing for you to be anxious about Just been an ordinary day,dear, just like any other Monday Today is Tuesday Monday,darling It's Tuesday,David You are tired,you've got confused And do you know which day of the week it is? Yesterday was Sunday,don't you remember? We worked in the garden,you pulled the rose tree,I cut the lawn Ah I'm just going to make you a nice cup of tea Do you know? You probably had an afternoon nap and dreamt that I didn't come home Well,I did Everything is all right David Just a moment Evening paper you brought in Look,Tuesday Well,that's extraordinary And let's look at this morning's paper This morning's paper isn't here because I took it with me to the office, now you know I always take it with me,Janet You didn't take the morning paper because you weren't here to take it Tuesday,the 27th,you see? We've always understood one and another,David And if you suddenly felt you wanted to go off and be on your own for a while Well,it's perfectly all right and I should have understood but why couldn't you telephone and tell me when coming home No,something,I don't understand happened,Janet You,you must give me time to think because I'm sure that some quite simple explanation and it will come in a minute Anyone at the bank can tell you I've been there all day You've not been at the bank all day I rang the manager I was getting supper ready at seven o'clock last night like I always do When you didn't come in I thought you missed the train at Cannon Street or the train was late for some reason But when 8 o'clock came and I was terribly worried because you always telephone if you are going to be late I thought you had an accident By nine o'clock I was so dreadfully anxious so I rang up the police You rang up the police? What did you expect me to do did you expect me to lock up the house and go to bed as if nothing had happened Then the Sgt.on duty said he'd Enquire at the hospitals and see if anyone been brought in I sat up here all night waiting and listening And then when the bank was open I rang the manager He said you hadn't come in this morning but you had left last night as usual at 5 o'clock Tell me you left at 6,David, you said you always leave at 6 That's right,Janet,so I do at 6 That's why I asked him again because it surprised me but he repeated it that you always leave at 5 He must have made a mistake or you misunderstood him He always leaves at 5,speaking of himself when he said that About 12 he rang up again and said you still hadn't come in Since then I've just been sitting here for hours and hours and thought I was going mad Then you walk in,David, as if nothing had happened and say that I dreamt it all All I can tell you,unless I've taken leave of my senses I've been at the bank all day and done the usual work I always do on Monday Look at my clothes Do I look as if I was wandering about all Monday night? Where could I've washed and shaved eh? After all do I look any different from what I look every evening when I come in from the office? Coming up the road just now Thinking on the ordinary every day things I think about on my way home then Tulips to put in around the house next Sunday the accounts of the social club to get ready for the general meeting next month Our evening at the pictures on Wednesday You know you are angry when I say you must have had a nap and dreamt it,and what else can I think? These papers I don't understand But there must be some explanation, some quite simple explanation Hello Oh,yes,Mr Cooper Yes,he's just come in No,he's quite all right I don't know is I'll tell him He says you've not been at the bank all day He'd like to speak to you Hello,good evening,Mr Cooper,Sir Yes,I'm quite all right I don't know I'm afraid there isn't anything I can tell you now I'll be at the bank early at a quarter to 9 And I come and see you in your office Yes,yes Good night,Sir Look There's Dr Sparling calling on the Preston's I noticed he wasn't on the train this morning I wonder if anything is wrong My husband is upstairs lying down,doctor -I'll take you up to him -Thank you You definitely think he is ill? I don't know,I do not know any more than I told you on the phone He came home looking quite well and cheerful He was perfectly all right until I showed him the newspaper Then he refused to believe it Then the bank manager rang up He believed it then What else could he do? Yes but he couldn't hoped to walk in like that and make you believe that nothing had happened unless he also believed it I know,he such an honest man,doctor I don't think he'd ever told a lie in his life I think he was absolutely genuine when he seemed surprised Yet I had a feeling he was concealing something -Oh -Well,a small thing But He said he left his office last night at 6 o'clock That he always leaves at 6 but The bank manager on the phone said he leaves at 5 regularly every night That hardly explains in any way the 24 hours Did you ask him about it? Yes,he said it was a mistake -He was so certain I must believe him -Of course You don't know us very well,doctor But I think you ought to know we are absolutely happy together I'm sure of that That's what made it hard But I did try to make him realize that I'd understand perfectly if he just wanted to go off and be on his own for a while What did he say to that? He swore that there was nothing, there was absolutely nothing -Then I think you should accept that -Yes,I do Because I am certain he always has told me the truth all the years we've been together Well,if you'll tell him I'm here -David? -Hmm Dr Sparling is here Oh Good evening Good evening,doctor It's quite some time since we last met,you remember,the social club dance Yes,at Christmas Quite a good crowd that evening That's keep you pretty busy being treasurer of a big club like that Oh,it does,it takes a good deal of time I enjoy it How many members have you got? Over 300 this year -Oh,it's a big thing -Yes It is,I hoped to start it 10 years ago with the gang was 15 members Gone ahead fast the past few years Well,you're looking very well I feel well,perfectly well My wife told you on the phone what happened Yes,she told me everything you told her It was so queer,doctor Like a night mare Yes Now look,I don't want you to take this in the wrong way But You do realize that anything you say to me is in strictest confidence And if there's anything you don't want Mrs Preston to know Oh,I can assure you definitely of that,doctor I can tell you no more than I told my wife,I told her everything I know From the moment I left home yesterday morning until the moment I arrived back here this evening I was absolutely convinced that I spent an ordinary day at the bank There's only one of the thing that could have happened You must have had a lapse of memory that apparently lasted a full 24 hours A lapse of memory? Where could I've been for 24 hours? That's what we got to try to find out You've been quite well recently I mean no headaches or unaccountable restlessness or sleeplessness No I don't think so Nothing seriously worrying you? Nothing to account for all this Was there anything unusual in your journey to London yesterday? No Arrived at the station a few minutes before the train came in met Major Watson on the platform, the President of our social club We travelled up together talked of club affairs new tennis courts we are laying down at the general meeting next month remember it all perfectly Nothing happened at the bank because the manager rang up and told my wife I've been there all day And you And you left the bank at -Your usual time -Yes Yes You did say anything I told you would be in confidence Absolutely I give you my word on that Well,there is one little thing There's a harmless trivial little thing that couldn't possibly have anything to do with all this But You You understand my wife and I are perfectly happy together Yes,of course Anyone has little things they like and dislike My wife doesn't like alcoholic drinks She's not intolerance,she's not a temperance fanatic or anything like that But I respect her wishes and that and I don't have them in the house anyway I drink very little but like a good many other men I enjoy a glass of sherry in the evening when I finish my day's works So do I,why not? There's been a habit of mine for some while to call in a little place and have a glass of sherry on my way to the station every evening It was just after the war,we're short of staff I was working every evening until 7 At 6 o'clock I go out have my drink and then go back and finish my work A little pub in a side street near the bank kept by a brother and two sisters Very nice people Joe's is about forty I suppose Ellen about the same age The younger sister she is much the younger under 30 I imagine Yes,I know what you are thinking,doctor Oh,not at all,why should I? She's perfectly harmless she's full of fun and I like her But we sit there passing the time of the day having a joke or so while I was drinking my sherry Well,when this late work finished I was free to leave the bank at the usual hour at 5 I was rather disappointed to think this pleasant half hour had to end It didn't open until 6 of course I could scarcely hang about for an hour waiting So you went around to the side door I used to do that at a place in Winchester during the war They live over the premises It was rather foolishly of me not to tell my wife but you see I I just let her think I still worked at the bank until 6 Then walked straight to the station for my train home Well,I don't think there's anything very terrible in that I imagine a lot of other city men do the same But why didn't you tell your wife? Why I didn't tell her I think it was mainly I didn't want her to to feel she was depriving me of anything I could easily have at home She would have insisted having the sherry in I didn't want it in I like it having it where I do at that time of the evening -Naturally -If I was to suddenly tell her now that I've been doing this she might think it was somehow connected with what's happened I'm sure it isn't You went there as usual last night? Oh,yes arrived just after 5 left in good time to catch my train Nothing unusual happened Nothing,had my sherry we all went into the salon bar and played a game of dart I remember 6 o'clock striking from St Paul as I said good night Well,it all boils down to the next hour because Normally you'd been at home at 7 Can you remember how you were feeling on the walk to the station Were there any incidents on the way? Really happy and contended as I always do walking to the station after my sherry You didn't have more than usual to drink that evening by any chance? I'm certain of that two is the limit they never press me I'm very much a creature of habit,doctor you know,one cup of tea for breakfast and exactly one half cup more things like that And you arrived at Cannon street in good time for your train Yes Yes This one curious little thing I can't even remember it if I wasn't searching around for something out of the ordinary I do remember a curious feeling as I walked on to the station and looked up at the big clock Can't really describe it a sort of vague and uncertain kind of feeling I was staring very hard at the clock So hard I can see it now quite distinctive Big white face the black hands pointing to quarter past six I remember Dazed,uncertain feeling when I went for my train I had to think before I could recollect the number of the platform Do you remember the journey home? Not absolutely I was wondering if you were finished Oh yes,yes,come in Mrs Preston,do I'm not disturbing you? No,no,no at all Come in Janet Well,I can promise you one thing,Mrs Preston Your husband's quite well in himself A case of lost memory is disturbing,naturally,but There's no need to be alarmed What were you doing during the war,Mr Preston? I was at the bank as usual I was an air raid warden down here Oh,well,you went through some bad bombings Oh yes we were right in Flybomb Alley here,you know Can you remember any specially bad experience? Well,there was that one at Aintshire Road,David Oh yes, had a close (?) squeak that night A fly bomb came down in a piece of wasteland behind the houses I was more than hundred yards off the time so the blast was pretty bad I wasn't hit by anything but I was deaf in this ear for some days Did you have medical attention? No,I don't think it's necessary I felt all right but the deafness that soon wore off You know,a shock of that kind can play funny tricks sometimes Oh,thank you We've had a lot of it since the war Yes If only I could remember when it happened And what I was dong all those hours We accounted for the whole of yesterday until Mr Preston arrived at Cannon Street Station on his way home Do you mean that he lost his memory at Cannon Street last night and stayed then until this evening? It is possible But wouldn't the station master or somebody have done something? You've no dim recollection of anything like that? None whatever I think that's possibly what happened Your memory began to go wrong at Cannon Street You just wandered aimlessly away Yes,and where to? For all those hours,the whole night? Well,that's something we don't know at present In the morning after a good night's sleep,you may remember some little things that'll piece the rest together The main thing is you're home Fit and well and no harm done Naturally you feel disturbed and worried I'll send you around something to settle you down when you go to bed Oh,I never take things like that Oh,it'll be quite harmless, just if you can't sleep And I look in at about 10 in the morning But I leave for the bank before eight I'd promised that manager I'd be there early I wouldn't go to the bank tomorrow morning ,if I were you Have a quiet day And don't worry You know,doctor There's one thing that's bothering me a bit about the bank,doctor You know it's practically certain I shall be manager of the Eastbourne branch next year It's a good branch and a good appointment but it may affect things very much if the director hear about this,you know They are queer people,those directors Supposing I said there was some misunderstanding If I said I spent the night with friends and my wife forgot Or I forgot to tell her Oh,that's entirely up to you My only concern if I'm asked for a certificate Oh,you won't be,I'll ring the manager in the morning and explain -I'm sure you'll support me in that,Janet? -I'll do whatever you think right,David I can't tell you how grateful I am for the way you helped me You know a lot of doctors that'll talk to lot of big words and frighten me out of my life No need of that,I'm sure -Still,if you'd like to see a specialist -Good heavens,no Hello,Preston,I'm just coming over to see you Oh,good evening,you know Major Watson, doctor,the President of our social club -How are you? -Not too bad I met you at our Christmas dance,didn't I? Yes,that's right I came as a guest -Have you recruited him as a member? -No,not yet but I think he'd ought to be Fine,you put him up,Preston,I'll second him it's the best club for miles around bridge,billiard, everything, including a monthly Brains Trust We've just been running a sweepstake on the Cambridgeshire,we've collected over 500 £ That's quite a lot of money, well,good bye,Mr Preston Good bye,good bye doctor -Nice chap? -Yes,quite a good fellow I was thinking only the other day we ought to rope in up a few doctors We've got a couple of chemists but doctors give a club more class What's he here for? Aren't you well? Oh,nothing much just a Just a touch of tummy trouble that's all I wondered why you weren't on the train this morning You've been home all day? No,as a matter of fact,I'd spend the night with friends Something I had for supper disagreed with me I decided to spend the night with them I've only just got home You say you spent the night with friends? Yes You mean you slept the night with them? Well,I've just told you Some old friends on the other side of London I go there now and then I came to see you about that sweepstake money You went to the club last night and took it away,didn't you? Robinson,the club steward said you were there in the office to 10 o'clock You must be pretty late for that dinner of those friends of yours on the other side of London if you didn't leave the club until after 10 You? You did go the club and take that money,didn't you? I told you I spent the night with friends Do you mean to tell me you didn't go to the club at all? No Good Lord What did the club steward tell you? Whatever he told me was a lie.The fellow is a dirty rotten low-down thief What did he tell you? He came round to my house last night to bring me the keys because he was going away on holidays He told me he put out all his lights but just as he was leaving he saw a light in the office He went in to put that out He found you there at the safe He saw that sweepstakes money all those bundles of notes on a chair He said that you told him you weren't altogether too happy about leaving all that money in that small safe But then you were going to take care of it until you paid out the prizes Do you mean to tell me that that's a lie? I've told you I wasn't there The dirty rotten thief had it all so smooth. Have you ever doubted him? He told me you acted oddly lost your temper and told him to go out and mind his own business Well,you never liked that fellow I never liked him either You see what he did? He wanted to make me wonder about you where the money had gone and give him more time to get away And the scoundrel had a clear day start Are you certain the money is gone? Certain? Of course I'm certain,515£ of club money,members money And the draw tomorrow night We'd better get the police on that at once Where is your phone? Major Watson,don't do anything tonight Don't do anything tonight,what do you mean? There may be some mistake, some misunderstanding -What kind of mistake the money is gone -It may not have been stolen Well,it beats me,you never liked the fellow,you never trusted him And now he's under doubt(?) you're only trying to cover him up I'm tired tonight,Major,I've had a bad day -I'm not well -Well? Do you think I'm well after all this? What are we going to tell the subcommittee tomorrow night? Will you wait until the morning, Major? Let's decide then And give him another clear night to get away? It's very serious to accuse a man until we are certain I'm the club treasurer I feel myself responsible I don't understand you I thought you were a businessman -I'll ring you first thing in the morning -I'll probably ring you before you ring me It's terrible,David,isn't it? And how did you know? Why? Mrs Thompson just called in,she told me But how did she know? I think it's all over the town What's all over the town? Didn't Major Watson come to tell you? Do you mean to say he hadn't heard? They found Robinson,the club steward this evening In that little wood by the pond on the common He's been murdered Murdered? Hello? Is that the police station? This is Major Watson, president of the Social Club I wish to report a robbery of 515 £ What do you say? Robinson? Murdered? Right,take him away Up,away Drive away,driver How much have you roped off? About twenty square yards,Sir I don't suppose they find much tonight We might as well have a look round I suppose these are the old dugouts something Yes,Sir Tell the photographer I want those plates first thing in the morning,will you? Yes,Sir They had a good look around,Sir but they've found nothing yet The ground's covered with leaves However,we'd better leave this to the morning Oh,tell the river police to drag the pond,will you? Right,Sir And see that you have plenty of men on duty Otherwise you may have the whole neighbourhood swarming in Good night,Sir Hart Road,please,Jim -Good morning,Mrs Preston? -Yes,that's right I'm Inspector Hemingway.I rung up just now and had a word with your husband -Yes,that's right,will you come in -Thanks Thank you He's in here Good morning,Mr Preston I'm Inspector Hemingway I spoke to you on the phone just now Yes,that's right -Will you,will you sit down? -Thank you Lovely show of those Japanese chrysanthemum you've got out there Yes,my wife goes in for those How do you get get such fine colours? Manage to get a little good manure from the riding school Not much of the good old stable stuff about these days No I'm afraid not You know down my road the milkman still calls with the horse and cart All of people with gardens waits with a pair of shovels hoping for a bit of luck That's one way The trouble is the horses are so regular in their habits the same man gets it every morning It's a bit of shock for you this Robinson business Yes You're the treasurer over at the club aren't you? -Yes,that's right -I suppose you knew him pretty well Well,only as club steward, he'll bring me the books I check them over and put the money in the bank Were they always in order? No trouble? None,whatever He wasn't a good book keeper there were small mistakes in additions but nothing deliberate Did he do everything in the club? There's a woman does the cooking and a little fellow that worked in the kitchen at weekends But he was at the hospital during the week, Robinson was practically on his own -What's the name of the cook? -Mrs Bridget And the other chap? I can't remember Well,I suppose I can contact him at the hospital Oh,yes,of course Major Watson told me a rather queer story -I think he saw you last night -Yes,he came in From his account,this fellow Robinson had some idea of involving you,Mr Preston Yes,Major Watson told me Major Watson says that you spent that night with friends on the other side of London It's only a matter of routine but if you just give me the name and the address of the people you stayed with that night, I can clear that up right away I spent the night with an old friend of mine His name is Wainwright Wainwright,will you give me his address please 17 Manor Road Wembley Well,I won't keep you now,Mr Preston You'll be needed at the inquest Because the story which Robinson told Major Watson will come in as evidence But we'll let you know in good time It's a rather bad luck on your club Were you insured against this kind of robbery? No,they weren't insured money Oh,let's hope we get it back for you I suppose you couldn't Spare a few of those chrysanthemums? Yes,of course My wife loves a bit of colour around the flat,we haven't got a garden,worse luck I'll ask my wife to cut you some You will? Oh,thanks very much Well, I'll drop by my own and pick them up on my way home,if I may Around about 5 o'clock -I'll see that they are ready for you -Fine We'll keep you informed,good bye Mr Preston Good bye What did he say? I'll tell you in a minute Who are you ringing up? Janet,I can't talk if you're here The inspector asked for some chrysanthemums Could you go out and pick them for him,please? -Then everything is all right -Yes,yes,it is Hello,hello Is that Wembley 7294? Yes,I want to speak to Mr Wainwright,please What? When did he go away? Last Saturday? But I must get in touch with him,it's very urgent Yeah Sure,you know what hotel he's staying at? I see I see No,no message Thank you Did he say what colour he likes? -Colours? What colour? -You said the inspector wanted some chrysanthemums It doesn't matter now But David,only a moment ago you told me Just a few of each That'll be all right Wherever are you going? The doctor will be here in an hour No,I'll just go round to the surgery I think a little walk would do me good Oh,Mr Preston,come in,come in How are you this morning? All right I was just coming round to see you You know what's happened? No,what? It's in your paper there Oh,you mean that murder on Monday Your club steward,it's quite close to where I live Well Have you been able to piece things together at all? No No small thought on memory that might help us No,there's nothing Supposing we try running through things again,quietly and slowly -And see whether.. -Oh,why don't you say What's in your mind and done with it I know exactly what you are thinking Every imaginatively person who suffers a lapse of memory Tries to fill in the gaps with all kind of things If you hadn't read about this affair you'd found something else, a burglary or something And let your mind play on that, you wouldn't be human if you didn't But it's absurd to connect this matter of the club steward with yourself Why is it absurd? When there's a person who suffers a lost memory still retains his own character,Mr Preston If a criminal lunatic lost his memory he'll probably continue behave like a criminal lunatic But a normal honest man will continue to behave normally and honestly Supposing a normal honest man Hated somebody,wouldn't he go on hating that person subconsciously after his memory had gone? But you didn't hate this man Robinson I did hate him But why? How can I explain? From the very moment he came up to the club committee I disliked him I opposed his appointment because of that He surely found out that I opposed him What made you do that? How could I tell I never had bad feelings of any man in my life except for him I just disliked his type, his big fat body,pale flabby face Most of all I disliked his eyes The way he looked at me I don't suppose I had any good grounds for opposing his appointment But Did he prove himself to be the wrong man? He did his work well enough The more I saw him the more I loathed him I used to look forward to going to the club after he came It was spoilt for me He had his eyes on me every time he came into the room I thought something evil and horrible about him I knew he'd glory in hurting me if he could and was waiting for a chance Gradually I I got the feelings somehow he He was fated to ruin and destroy me You see,that's why I told you to stay at home today and rest Imaginations can play cruel tricks And you thought I'm suddenly imaging all this,do you? For months now I wake up in the nights fuming of what he'd done to destroy my pleasure in the club Wondering what I could do to get rid of him But you got to be sensible You never in your wildest moments thought of murdering him? Naturally I didn't Well,then you're not very likely to murder him on Monday night Do you know what happened on Monday night? A few hours before he died,he told Major Watson he saw me in the club Taking the sweepstakes money But you can prove that you didn't do that either How can I? By common sense and reason If a man was desperately in need of money then it's possible he might be drawn subconsciously to a place where money could be found That is possible Yes,if he definitely had theft in mind before his lapse of memory If you are going to tell me you've been calmly planning robbery and murder for the past few weeks then,I don't believe you and I never shall And what's more I can't help you because you're making no attempt to help yourself When you left me last night I thought I'd wake up this morning with everything clear When I heard about this murder I didn't dare sleep All night long I never lost the sound of the rain trickling outside the trains and the traffic in the distance It began to come In little bits at first as you said it would Queer little disconnected things The chestnut tree,some thin strips of metal tinkling like bells A man's feet rustling in dry leaves One half of my brain fought against it the other side went probing on Suddenly I remembered I was on a common I saw every detail,the moon was shining The wind was rattling those little strips of metal men hang around their allotments to scare the birds I saw the pond where the children paddled and sailed their boats a long line of chestnut trees with the dry leaves coming down The two old dugouts under the mount I was walking along the (?) path beside the pond In a desperate kind of fear This man Robinson was following me in the dark Creeping along like a fat grey slug I went between the trees,down the steps of one of the dugouts There was a pile of sandbags in one corner and some squares of that tarred roofing stuff I laid the money under the square and I covered it over with sand All around I could hear him out there roaming about in the dead leaves I came up the steps And looked out I could just see him going into the wood And I followed him When did you first know he'd been murdered? Last night when somebody called on my wife Did this person tell your wife how it was committed? Didn't ask How did it happen when it came back last night? I followed him into the wood I tore my mind away from it,it was too horrible You see perfect autosuggestion Now doesn't that make you see reason? You dreamt what you were told by your wife Oh,I wish I could believe you You added to that dream what Major Watson told you about the money and you woke up when your information about the details came to an end What makes you so certain I dreamt it? Because it's the sort of dream a man would have after your experience You told me my memory might come back you can't be so certain I can only weigh the two things together and go for the one that's more probable When anyone would ask me point blank if I remember anything of those last hours would anyone in authority would to ask me on oath would it be honest to still say that I remember nothing? In your place I certainly would If you were sure then it might be different but you are not I give myself the benefit of a doubt the Law does that in any case Whether,it's honest I don't know,but that's what I'll do if I were questioned I have been questioned -When? -Just now Inspector came round to my house wanted to know where I was on Monday night But you didn't tell him all this? No,I didn't Did you mention this loss of memory? No,I didn't do that,you see I told Major Watson I spent that night with friends He told the police they wanted to know the name and address the people I stayed with I couldn't very well go back on what I told the Major I'm afraid I wasn't very honest,it happened so quickly,I hadn't time to think What did you say? I told him I spent Monday night in Wembley with a man named Wainwright He's my best and oldest friend and would do anything for me as I would for him I knew if I rang him up and told him that I'd told the police I spent the night with him he'll say that I did without question Did he agree to that? The caretaker answered the telephone Wainwright went on a motoring tour on Saturday morning He spent the weekend in the Lake District He's somewhere in Scotland now I might have known something like that would happen I'm afraid it's rather serious I'm sorry to drag you into a thing like this,doctor You're a busy man you got a lot of people you ought to see What do you think I ought to do,if I go to the inspector,what am I to tell him? I wouldn't tell him anything if I were you Until I've had proper advice In what way? Well,I know the first thing I'd do myself would be to get a good solicitor I haven't got a solicitor, do you know of one? I'm going to take you round to mine Mr Petherbridge It's a thousand pities that you felt it necessary to mislead the police with an untrue statement,Mr Preston I was just going to explain Do you realize that you ask this friend of yours to commit perjury? Are you for me or against me in this,Mr Petherbridge? I'm afraid Mr Preston is giving the police a tremendous advantage in making a false statement of his whereabouts on Monday night I think there are something else in Mr Preston's mind I told you that he had some impressions last night and personally I think it was a dream -You mean concerning this money? -Yes Well,surely it's easy enough to find out about that Simply by going to the dugout and seeing whether the money is there I think it would be most unwise, the police would have men on duty We should be inviting suspicion Yes,but it would settle Mr Preston's mind That's not the important issue A dream which turns out to be imaginary is not proof of a man's innocence Material witness and definite proofs are the factors that really count Excuse me You won't find the money there,you know We are not looking for it here,Sir It's the man we are after, he was in that office on Monday night Anyone who takes the money doesn't matter from the way you're going on Do you realize there's a draw tomorrow night and the race three days later? It won't effect the race,will it,Sir? I mean they'll still have that If we don't get that money back, heaven knows what's going to happen Ah,inspector there you are Any news of that money? No.I'm afraid not yet,Major -Where are.. -Inspector There's There's something rather funny I want to show you Do you,do you see? This safe wasn't opened with a key at all It was broken open Yes,I see it was Do you know,last night I could have sworn that Robinson did this Did Robinson had a key to the safe? No,but Preston did What are you trying to say,Major? Excuse me You see Major Watson speaking Who? Oh Yes -Wembley Police Station for you,Inspector -Thank you Inspector Hemingway here Yes,that's right Yes? Oh,I see All right,thank you I am going to see Mr Preston now What about? Only some flowers he promised to let me have Is there any personal property that you can't account for? Any small things that you had with you before you lost your memory you're missing now? Yes,his gloves and the handkerchief I'm not certain about the handkerchief You see he always carries two One folded in his breast pocket and the other one tucked in his sleeve Well,the one in the pocket was there, I'm not certain I had the other I think that I did Can you describe the gloves? Brown leather almost new -Had the handkerchief your name on it? -My initials D H P He may have left them in the train Yes,we must hope that he did Well,Mr Preston,I suggest that we communicate with the police at once and tell them that you wish to correct your previous statement You will then recount to them every detail that actually happened But nothing at all about what you may have recollected or imagined since What will they do then? I don't know depends on the extent on which they accept your husband's statement that he did actually lose his memory But he did,we know that We have to prove it,Mrs Preston We must engage the best possible counsel to defend you What will that cost? In a difficult case like this you will need an outstanding man If a person is suspected of stealing can show himself to be in good circumstances,he's no urgent need of money Then his position in the eyes of the jury is far stronger But I still can't see what you mean I mean that an important counsel commands a larger fee than a lesser man If you can show yourself in a position to meet that fee then automatically you show the jury,you're unlikely to have stolen out of urgent need But what would that cost? Well,I should say that 500 guineas would provide for everything I'm sorry to disturb you again, Mrs Preston,is your husband in? -Oh,yes,he's in here -Thank you Good morning,Inspector Good morning,Mr Petherbridge Mr Preston has asked me to act for him Well,Mr Preston,I expect you know why I called again Yes Our Wembley station called at Mr Wainwright's house Yes,I know Mr Wainwright went on his holiday on Saturday Yes Well,if you knew that Mr Wainwright had gone away I'm wondering why you told me you stayed with him I didn't know You mean you didn't know when you told me this morning? That is correct -If you excuse me Inspector I think -It's quite all right,Mr Petherbridge Well,Mr Preston,I wonder if you don't mind just walking around to the station with me You know it's only our routine to take down a statement from everybody anyway concerning an affair of this kind It's just a formality I've taken a statement from Major Watson this morning and will be taking a quite a few more I'll do anything you need It won't take long -Shall I be coming back? -Yes,of course Will it be all right if I come too? You wish to make a statement,Mrs Preston? No,no but I think my husband would like me to be there,wouldn't you dear,I mean? I'd like to wait for you I think I'd stay here,Janet There's no need I imaging you were wearing what you might call a city suit on Monday? Yes Would you mind if we take that along with us? And the shoes you were wearing? Just another bit of routine they make us do -If you need them -I'll fetch them I'll come along up and help pack them I think I'll go up too No Mr Petherbridge If I tell you something will you promise not to say a word about it to my husband? Certainly I think it'll help you to understand,you see For a long time now he's been terribly need of money It's not his fault,it was his father It all began years ago his father travelled round collecting money for his firm And then one day Well,he couldn't pay,I think it was betting But David undertook to pay back every penny his father had taken He borrowed some from friends and the rest he got from a moneylender Gradually he paid back all his friends but the moneylender kept adding expenses and things and until now it's nearly double what it was to begin with He wrote a horrible letter saying unless all the money was paid back he'll tell David's bank Well,now I have a little money of my own,an annuity I wanted to sell it there and then but David was furious I think it was the first real quarrel we ever had He said nothing would make him use my money I see If the police happen to ask for any statement,Mrs Preston I think you'd be well advised to say nothing whatever about this Oh,yes,but you do see that we must pay counsel's fee without David knowing He could never hope to pay them himself He'd be rather not be defended at all if he knew it came from my money Yes I quite see that, you'll be sure personally I shall take no advantage of your difficulties,Mrs Preston Thank you Nice piece of material isn't it? -Yes -Pre war,isn't it? Yes You haven't cleaned the suit since Monday? No Oh,and now the shoes you were wearing Oh Stepped into some mud,didn't you? Mud? I don't remember It's all right,thank you,Mr Preston I'd never believe that David did this terrible thing But they haven't said so,it's possible they never will But they think it If not,why did the inspector want to take away his clothes They only do that to criminals It's horrible Something they always have to do Oh,we are going along now You've no objections to me being with my client when he makes his statement? No,none at all,we prefer you do Well,we won't be long,Mrs Preston -Take this in to Sgt. Evans will you? -Very good,Sir This way please,Mr Preston Sit down,please,Mr Petherbridge This is only an informal talk I don't intend to make me notes Now then,Mr Preston The caretaker of Mr Wainwright's house told our people that somebody rang up for Mr Wainwright at about half past 9 this morning -Was it you? -Yes I intended to ask Mr Wainwright That's quite all right Only it occurred to me that you might have given me that information by mistake That you might have stayed with Mr Wainwright some other time and got it mixed up with a visit you paid to another friend on Monday night Well,when I saw you this morning I explained that I only wanted the information to rule out the story which Robinson told Major Watson Now I'm not asking for a minute by minute account of everything you did that night But as a man can't very often do that when he's suddenly asked For instance Monday afternoon I went for a walk in the park Stopped and watch the football match I couldn't tell anybody what time I stopped or how long I watched the football You see what I mean I just want a rough idea I can't tell you anything about my movements on Monday night or anything about Tuesday until I retuned home in the evening because I had a lapse of memory I see Hello,doctor,what are you doing here? I'm waiting to see the inspector Oh,I want to see him too The inspector got the club books and there's a meeting of the subcommittee tonight Heaven knows what's going to happen Poor old Preston,I'd never have believed it But then you know,when you see that pictures in the paper It always is that sort of fellow,isn't it? Well,have you any little,shall we say,gleams of memory? Only little memories that couldn't belong to other time No,I have tried to think,there's nothing Well,did you have everything with you when you got back? Nothing missing? Well,anything found,anything say like a bus ticket or anything like that,anything That might show where you went or what you did Been through all my pockets with the hope of finding something,there was nothing Now,about this safe,Mr Preston Do you happen to know how many keys there are to it? Oh,yes,they are three,Major Watson has one,I have one there's one at the bank down here I imagine you keep yours in a safe place Keep it with my other keys,this My office key,keys to the house, this is the key for the safe Oh,that's all right Robinson the steward didn't have one then? No,no need for him to go to the safe,he had a till all of his own You got a key to the club itself I suppose Yes,with the others Here Do you sometimes go around there after the steward has closed up for the night? Occasionally I have a small office there, sometimes I walk round after supper And you have no recollection at all of having been there on Monday night? None whatever Do you re... Do you think they'll swallow his loss of memory idea? Why not? It's true But could a fellow do all that sort of things with his memory gone? Oh,it's possible but I don't believe he did What do they they call it insane or something? You're an old friend of his,Watson? Well,I've known him for 10 years or more I roped him in when I first started my club And naturally you want to do all you can to help him Well,I don't want to make things worse for him any more than you do but I'm president of that club and I must get that money back Now,tell me another thing Supposing they let him off supposing they say that he is innocent, would he be allowed to keep the money? Why are you so convinced he took the money? Well, it's bound to come out, so you may as well know it Preston was hard up,he borrowed money all around the club,I lent him 50 £ myself But he paid you back Oh yes in time But I never known a man get cleared out of debt once he started borrowing Now another thing He hated that club steward He was always bringing up petty complaints about him trying to get him the sack Now I can tell you another thing too That safe was not opened by a key: it was broken open Well,if Preston had a key why do that? Don't need a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one He broke it open because he had a key and Robinson hadn't And furthermore he knew that Robinson was starting for holidays that night See? I don't see anything except a lot of chance things that might happen to anyone But you didn't see his face when I told him that Robinson had been around to see me He looked awful Then he tried that story about spending the night with friends on the other side of London Now look, a man with a blank space in his memory can say anything on the spur of the moment When I told him I was going to the police about the robbery he practically went down on his bended knees and begged me not to Would a fellow do that if he didn't know something? If Preston was at the safe and Robinson caught him there why let Robinson come round and tell you abut it before doing anything? Because he didn't know that Robinson was coming round to see me I could tell that when I told him that myself I thought he was going to faint Now put yourself in his place remember and see what you would do You plan a robbery and try to plant it on to somebody else Then a man,that you planned to plant it on Catches you red-handed You tell him some story about better keep the money yourself And he goes off but you don't know whether you convinced him Then suddenly you remember that you've broken open the safe yourself and ought to make it look as if he did it All right so far? -Oh yes, perfectly -OK Remain of the jam(?) Now you know he's got to get home and get his bag and then catch the train to London You know where he lives,you know the path he's got to take across the common How was the murder done? Knocked on the head from behind Battered in Yes,it does look bad for Preston But then if you try a lot of chance things together and throw a bit of imagination it might look as just as bad even worse -For others -Oh yes -Even for you -For me? That's rich Why not? Supposing you wanted money You knew where it was just as well as Preston did On what proof you've got that Robinson ever came round to your house that night at all,was there a witness? My wife was there In the room? No,she was in bed but she heard the bell That's easy,I mean you could have gone out and rang the bell yourself if necessary You see we've only got your word that Robinson came round that night and accused Mr Preston Suppose you broke open the safe because you have a key At first perhaps you mean it to appear as an outside burglary But Robinson captures you red handed All right so far? Far from it,I was at the pictures on Monday night I only got back just before Robinson called But can you prove it? Did you go with anyone? No,my wife doesn't like the pictures I always go by myself You see,no proof you were at the pictures no proof Robinson called You killed Robinson to keep him quiet then you think of Preston you know it's common knowledge in the club that he disliked Robinson you knew he borrowed money,good You go round to Preston's house to see how things are And by the grace of the devil You discovered this lapse of memory that's makes even Preston doubts himself it's wonderful,you're clear leave Preston alone and his own imagination will do the rest You got quite a imagination yourself But you make one big mistake In your overanxiety to set the blame squarely on Preston You talked against him so much that you make the police suspicious They enquire into your movements and find you can't prove a thing about that night I tell you I was at the pictures When you tell the police that old yarn they'll laugh I mean everybody trying to prove a false alibi says they were at the pictures There was one the other day They are hanging him on Friday Oh Of course I know perfectly well you had not anything to do with it I'm only trying to tell you how easy it would be for an innocent person to bring suspicion on himself simply by trying to incriminate another one I never said I wanted to I know,I know I was just speaking generally that's all Hello old chap,if there is anything I can do for you,just let me know Thanks Would you come in now please,Sir No,not you,Major Watson,Dr Sparling Would you mind waiting a few minutes I understand you want to see the clubs books Come here,this room I understand that Mrs Preston called you in last night to see her husband Yes,about half past seven just after he got home Now,this lost memory business, can you tell me anything about it What makes it happen? Well,in most cases it is usually do to a mental strain I mean,if a man suppresses it and keeps it to himself it keeps building up and until the strain is too great for the brain to bear And then the mind shuts off and stops working or rather like a generating station when the load gets too heavy In a case like this have you anyway of telling if it's genuine? Oh,you can if you see the patient when he's actually suffering from amnesia But if you don't see it until it's over then you only got his words for it You got your own instinct and judgement I talked with Preston for a quite a while last night And again this morning And I'm certain that everything he told me was the truth Did he tell you that he spent that night with a friend in Wembley? When a man tells you a barefaced story like that It makes you wonder about the rest of what he says,doesn't it? Now you say he saw you again this morning Yes,he came out to my surgery And on account of something he told you then you advised him to see a solicitor? Well,it was because of this untrue statement I thought he should see a solicitor Was that all he told you? It's all right ,doctor,I understand your position If you think that he made any kind of confession,I can tell you at once,he didn't Did you know he was badly pressed for money? Yes,I've been told so by a friend of his And he had a violent dislike for this murdered man? Now,if he's as straight forward as you think he is Why should he sit there desperately trying to conceal something from me? Look,your business is mainly with criminals,inspector If you are dealing with an honest man Depends what you call honest Well,we got quite a lot of fellows like Preston Decent,respectable people who live quietly, dig the garden,go for a walk on a Sunday Perfectly good straight chaps Except for the one little thing that brings them round here Doesn't make sense does it? Tea's ready dear -Good -I thought you'd like some toast Yes,that's fine I I've been sorting out a few things this afternoon,Janet Only the gas bill,the laundry and the small account for Rogers for the tulips I've written cheques for those Certainly won't be necessary,David Yes I know but I always done these little things myself I wouldn't like you to be troubled or confused,if you were alone I'm sure there's no need,dear If they were going to do anything they'd done it already,when they had you at the police station The inspector was so nice when he rang me up Yes,he's a nice man I'm lucky He said to see you rested when you got home and not to worry Wouldn't have been as cruel as to say a thing like that if he meant anything Yes,he let me go home all right but he He put a policeman to watch the house You imagine things,David,there's often a policeman out there by the High Street There's being one there all day standing under the lamp post You're just tormenting yourself,dear You know If you were alone,Janet,I wouldn't like you to live by yourself I was thinking,perhaps your sister would care to come or whether you go to her You see,your sister would have her pension and you'll have your annuity -You're listening,Janet? -Yes It wouldn't be much but two women can always manage together You might even start up a kindergarten school again like you had with her in the old days Would you? Would you do that Janet? I'll do whatever you say, dear,until you came back I had a talk this morning with the solicitor about that moneylender you know,there's nothing whatever for you to worry about He'd have no power to make any claim on you In fact,I don't think he can claim anything anyway I paid him a lot more than he lent me And Mr Petherbridge says the solicitor's letter will settle it Now,I'm telling you this because if he should write,don't answer it Give the letter straight to Mr Petherbridge Above all Don't dream of doing anything silly Like trying to raise money on that annuity and sending it to him -Now you promise me that? -Yes I'd written to the bank I want you to post that If they take me away I'll explain everything and I'm sure they'll do something for you after all the time I've been with them You mustn't talk like this,dear,I can't bear it Yes,but I couldn't bear it if I had to go away without thinking with arranged everything possible between us it's so simple sitting here by ourselves Afterwards Don't think they let us be alone together But Even if they did take you away they couldn't treat you like a criminal Doctor Sparling said they couldn't possibly do that It wouldn't be human to blame you for something that happened when you weren't yourself Oh,we got to face these things,dear even if they believe when I say that I wasn't myself that night They wouldn't let me go,they couldn't There are place for people who do things when they are not themselves and then We are not certain they'll believe I lost my memory at all Then,it's true,David It is true,isn't it? Oh I swear that,Janet Those things you thought you remembered you mustn't tell them that Well,if they ask me in the court,I'm afraid I'll have to But Mr Petherbridge said no He said not to in my statement to police,that's all but you see these people that cross examine they'll tearing things out of you, they'll go on till they do I couldn't bear that,Janet At least I can keep myself self-respect and if I can do that I don't mind what happens as long as you promise to carry on and be happy How could I be happy? By believing in me,dear By trusting me when I tell you I didn't do this deliberately It means so much to me if you do that Now You start up that little school again it'll give you an interest and help you along In any case you always have your annuity, one can never take that away from you Never have to be dependent on anybody Well,I still think it never happened David, it's your imagination all the time I took a lot of trouble with this toast You always knew the way to make toast You haven't slept at all Even rested properly since you came home Go up and lie down and try to get some sleep Yes I think that's a good idea At seven we'll have supper and then,why not go to the pictures It's our night,isn't it? By so it is,it's Wednesday,I've forgotten They didn't say you had to stay in We'll say good evening to that policeman on the corner You see,he'll say good evening back and not take a bit of notice And you wonder why you've been so silly Oh I can't think why you are so good to me It's you who is always good to me You will go and try and rest,won't you? Yes Don't you worry I I would like you Just to have a look at this account book Make sure you understand everything and let me know if there's anything you don't, now it's quite simple that What we receive here and the payments there Now there's not much now But there will be nearly 100 £ when my salary comes in next week And now you don't owe anything Nothing We'll save up and go abroad again next summer Yes,we'll do that Draw the curtains and have a good sleep There's one or two things to tidy up,then I will I'll come up and call you when supper is ready Then the pictures That'll be fine Oh,good evening -Does Mr Preston live here? -Yes -Are you Mrs Preston? -Yes Could I speak to Mr Preston,please? He's resting and I can't disturb him now But it's about this trouble,this murder Then you'd better come in You see,I'm really quite an old friend of Mr Preston And I thought I might be able help him What? I think I know most of my husband's friends Well I expect you do,I don't suppose Dave ever told you about me Dave? Well,Mr Preston He always let me call him Dave But I'm sorry Is he in trouble about this murder? I mean really in trouble? Because if he is I want to help him and I think I can Then you'd better sit down -You live in a nice house -Yes You,you haven't told me your name? It's Miss Dobson,Peggy Dobson I work with my brother and sister at the Feathers River Lane,just off Queen Victoria Street in the City,you know? -The Feathers? -It's a public house Our own place What is you want to say? Well,I came down as soon as I could get away I only heard about this trouble at lunchtime My husband's name hasn't been in the papers,how did you know he was in trouble? Well,a young man who lunches at our place comes from down here and he told us how they had Mr Preston round at the police station Of course he read about this murder in the papers but even if they had mentioned him,we might never had known it was our Mr Preston Your Mr Preston? I know it's funny we've known him all these years,and we never knew where he came from We only realized when this young man said You know that fellow Preston who comes every evening they are after him for that Bromley murder And then I saw I got to come at once I thought things must be bad Yes,they are bad But why did you come,what's it's about? Well,everything Last Monday night You see,Mr Preston been coming to our place always since the war He just drops in when he's on his way home Look If you think there's anything in this, you're wrong because there isn't I'm not the sort that goes out with other people's husbands and I never did I didn't suggest it,Miss Dobson No,but you're looking,anyone can see that It's no use my talking to you, if you aren't going to listen why don't you call him down and let me tell him No,my husband is very tired, he's trying to rest now if you have anything to say,you can tell me The Feathers is respectable You can ask anybody All he ever had was a sherry or a sandwich maybe So nice,we sit down chatting in our private room Your private room? Because he came before we open,that's why Or sometimes we go into the salon bar have a game of dart But he always left on the stroke of 6 to catch the train at Cannon Street You say he's done this for a long time Oh,every evening regular Getting on for five years now Well,we thought he looked specially tired on Monday night So I gave him a Bovril sandwich with the sherry Then we went into the salon bar for a game of darts We were laughing and joking And then the strangest thing happened There is a little truck that brings our sandwiches from a place in Hornsea But it was just starting off and he had a terrific backfire Like a gun going off,we all jumped because it startled us Mr Preston did too He turned his head quickly And when he turned it back, he looked different What do you mean he looked different? He looked round as if he didn't know where he was and dropped the dart he had in his hand And he said Everyone down to the dugout What dugout? I don't know,we never had a dugout, we always used the cellar in the war That he made us see what had happened We knew he'd been an air raid warden And he suddenly thought the war was still on Of course we talked to him and told him it was all right But he He just kind of mumbled and kept shaking his head You see didn't know what to do Why didn't you telephone and tell me? Then how could we? We didn't know where he lived And there are crowds of Preston in the telephone book Then opening time came Of course we couldn't have him sitting in the bar looking like that So my brother Joe took him up to the spare bed room and made him lie down Hoping he get all right Actually he dozed off,but it wasn't an ordinary sleep because we couldn't wake him When the bar closed at 10,we all went up all three of us and sat about there talking on what we ought to do But you could have sent for a doctor Oh,we did think of that We even thought sending for the police He didn't have anything to help us No identity card or letters or anything But he was sleeping so peacefully, we thought we'd better leave him And see how he felt when he woke up No,thank you Well,Joe and I looked at him twice during the night Still sound asleep But he woke quite easily when I took his cup of tea in the morning Still very odd,though He still didn't know where he lived or the place where he worked He didn't seem to care or want to think when we asked him He washed,shaved himself quite naturally with Joe's razor But his mind was still all mixed up with the war He kept on saying,it was a quiet day with no alarms and then he say Listen,there's one coming Take cover He was thinking of the fly bombs all the time We gave him some breakfast and made him stay quietly in his room But Joe said if he wasn't better by the afternoon he had to take him round to the police station You knew that his bank was quite close why didn't you tell them? We didn't know,of course we knew he worked in a bank,but we didn't know where He didn't discuss those things, it wasn't our affair The doctor said it might be something like this What did he do the whole day? He just sat about up there in that bedroom Soon after five Joe said the only thing to do was to take him round to the police station and tell them what happened That was really the oddest part of all We went into the salon bar, we all had a sherry And then he began to change He looked Puzzled and restless And then he sort of raised himself up and said Well Aren't we going to finish our game of darts? Come on What are we waiting for Of course we quite didn't know what to do at first But Joe thought it was better not to say anything in case it upset him again You know it was kind of uncanny Then a new round,you know trying to make jokes and ordinary conversation Bang Time to go -Hello,nice speaking -Hello Well,of course we hated the idea of him going off like that alone But,honestly,he looked so ordinary and natural when he took his hat and umbrella off the peg we almost thought we were the funny ones Hello,Dave Why did you come here? Oh,I heard you were in trouble,Dave I I should have told you,Janet Never mind about that,dear,listen to what Miss Dobson has to say Then I thought that I'd better find out where you lived and come down to try to help you How could you help me? Miss Dobson says you spent the whole of Monday night in her care(?) You stayed the whole night at the Feathers,Dave When I tell them that,they can't go after you any more You know I left your house at 6 o'clock as St Paul was striking 6 Yes,but you didn't,I mean not on the same day as you came in You didn't come out until this murder was all over I came into your house just after 5 it was exactly 5 by the office clock, when I left the bank And I left your house as the clock was striking,the police know that The police never came near our place,how can they know? Because I told them everything that happened just as I remembered Janet I came round to tell you something Upstairs in the bedroom I suddenly remembered quite clearly the people in the compartment that the train left Cannon street it was an old man with red flower in his buttonhole And two girls,two girls reading books Look,David,it doesn't matter what you say or think directly I've been to the police station,your troubles are over Do the police know that you come here? Not yet,they jolly soon will You know what will happen if you went to them how serious it would be,you're not a child,Peggy,you realize the consequences? Look,Dave,you don't understand what's happened to you and you're not trying to understand I am trying to understand,Peggy I'm trying to understand why these terrible things should happen to me What can make me think I could save myself by dragging in my best friend get him to stand by me swearing I was in his house that night The police would have found him out and he'd been arrested that's what would happen to you if you went with this tale they'd call it perjury, you could go to jail for it now I want you to go home Peggy, you're dealing in dangerous things more dangerous than you realize, now you promise me that'll you go home Peggy,you must go at once Take her out that way, she can use the side door this man is from the police if he says anything to you,you say anything but you know nothing about this You understand Oh,stay here Good evening,Mrs Preston, is your husband home? Oh,yes,yes he's upstairs but first I want you to hear what this young lady has to say Well,I expect you're Miss Dobson I heard you'd come down I've been having a talk with your brother and sister at Feathers this afternoon Yes,you had,have you? Well,Mrs Preston,I'm sure it must be a relief to you You know we never real thought your husband was involved We had to check up on these things,of course Inspector,I want you to make you understand Ever since that terrible news last night My husband thought himself to be a criminal lunatic Waiting to be taken away and locked up for the rest of his life Can't you realize what's that's done to him? Yes I can,Mrs Preston,I only wish it could have been avoided He's always lived so quietly Only wanted to do his work And enjoy his evenings and be happy with his friends A thing like this would have driven him mad He wouldn't even listen to what Miss Dobson had to say You got to go up and convince him It was I came to do,Mrs Preston As far as your husband's concerns there's no more to worry about It's perfectly all right Oh,so it's perfectly all right is it? You think you can walk in here smiling and everything is all right Anybody would think you'd talking about a lost dog that's come home Don't you realize you made him ill? When you knew he hadn't done it why couldn't you phone up from the Feathers and tell him so? No, not you You come sailing in your own good time and let him wait let him suffer,whatever his feelings matter All you fellows are good for is hanging around our place at night waiting to see for if anyone has a glass of beer five past 10 I'll go now,Mrs Preston,you don't want me about -I do hope he'll be all right,good night -Good night,thank you Thank you Do you want me for anything else? No,there's nothing,thank you You know where to find me,if you do It's Peggy Dobson,the Feathers,River Lane I'm sorry,inspector,but it was nice of her to come Now He's in his bedroom There Oh,I I'm just coming down Well,just came up to tell you there's no more for you to worry about It's perfectly true Now You won't need this thing Come and sit down And I'll tell you all about it Well,to begin with,Mr Preston We've got the man who did it As a matter of fact it was you, who put us on the right track When you told me about the little chap who worked in the hospital in the evenings and the club kitchen weekends But the thing that had been puzzling us was the co-incidence of someone trying to plant a robbery on a man the very night is missing from home You know it looks to me as if Robinson, the club steward and this little chap had planned to get that money Maybe Monday night,maybe the next,I don't know But when they hear the club treasury is missing,it's a gift They break open the safe,share the money Robinson goes around to Major Watson, tries to plant the thing on you After that,it's the old story of thieves falling out Anyway,Robinson got a knock over the head,the other chap took the lot Isn't it splendid,Mrs Preston,we've got all the money back bar two pounds ten That's fine,Major Of course,I always said your husband was innocent But if I were he,I'd prosecute that inspector Tell him to be at the club tomorrow evening It's the draw -Good night,Mrs Preston -Good night Well,I'm afraid it caused you awful lot of trouble and anxiety,Mr Preston But The sort of thing that might happen to anybody Oh,and Here's a pair of gloves and a handkerchief which you left in a spare room at the Feathers I believe your solicitor was a bit worried about this Well,I say good night now,Mr Preston Good night Inspector Your flowers Thank you very much,Mrs Preston My wife will be delighted Subtitles by Nostromo
