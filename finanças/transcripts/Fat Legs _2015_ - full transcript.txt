It was a terrible job. So we'll repaint. Me, I did it. Sure! You're more than welcome to help. If you want to paint, great! Ah yes, super! It's obviously been done by a complete amateur.

How did you manage that? He's so beautiful. I know. Wasn't he your boss? Strategy, babe. You have to tell me. Would you mind not talking about me while I'm here?

Yeah, so you can pop your bag in my room as well. Are we sharing a bed? Of course. Ooh la la. Don't ever, ever say that again. Who is she? Anna. Is she sleeping here? Yeah! Right. She could sleep somewhere else. Where? I don't know, a hotel? A hostel? She's your friend. Of Course she should sleep here. I'll make sue it's not for too long. Marie's coming on Wednesday to take photos. Anna will still be here. What about Thursday or Friday? How is she? The same. Did you sleep? Okay. What does Poisson Pleure mean? Crying fish. I gave it to Philippe. Bad joke. Can I oblige one? Oblige away. Did I scare him off? Mmmm. He's in the hospital. His mom's there. Serious? She's dying. Oh, fuck, I can go. I shouldn't have turned up like this. It's fine, she's taking a really long time, so I don't think a few days will make a difference. I can sleep on the couch of you want? Relax. Go and get us a vino. Okay. So what's the show? Film. Can't say. Do you play a prostitute? Possibly. - Do you die? - Maybe. Brilliant. I don't think I'll get it. Oh, that's the spirit. Shooting here? Yeah. Callback? Mm-hmm. Wow, they must like you. Trust me, they want an English actress. And what are you? Not English. Well, you're English enough. You sound pretty plummy to me. I still sound like a hick to them. I started telling people I went to Eton. Does that work? No, I just look like a hick liar. Well? A toast to my hick liar, and to the pleasure of her company. Even if you don't get it, I am glad that they wanted to see you so that I could see you. I don't know where I'd be without you. In a hostel. So, how's London? Same. Where are you living now? Oh, Babu, no. It's cheap. You shouldn't be giving that guy money. Well, he hasn't put the rent up. Wow, give the guy a medal. Does Philippe live here now? No, he's got his own place a couple of blocks away. Oh, right. What, what, did he say he did? No, no, we were signing. Okay. You're either selling it or blowing it up. Mmhm. Wow Babu, that's huge. When? Soonish. Philippe already has his place on the market. He wants a garden for a puppy. Not a pug. Yep. Cliche. You hungry? Yeah. Yes, thank you very much. Lower heat, babe. No, it takes too long. Oh, what's that? It's still good. No, not this, that, that's awful. - Oh! - Don't need to answer it. - Jean! - Hi, Mum. Are you in London? No, Mom, I'm in Paris. Where's Anna? Anna, come and say hi to your mum. Hi, Mom. What are you doing there, love? I got the callback. Oh, well, that's fantastic! Thank you. She's going to be a star, Mom. Hilarious. How are you, Jean? I'm good, I'm good. How's your mom? Same. Give her my love, all right? I will. What about you? Got a boyfriend yet? - Oh, can you not? - What? Well, thanks very much, Anna. No, Jean, not currently. What about you? Oh, Mom, Philippe. He is so gorgeous. They're buying a house together. Ooh la la. Has he got a brother? For you, Mom? Either one of us. Don't want to end up like Grey Gardens, do we, Banana? Oh, thanks very much, Mom. Oh, Anna, lighten up. Is he an actor too, Jean? Oh, god, no. He owns a shop. Oh, what kind of shop? A sex shop. He does not. No, a cheese shop, Anna's favorite. Oh no, you keep her out of there. I don't want to have to send any more money for phone bills. Mom, I should go. Everything all right? Yes. You sure? Yes. - Don't get snappy. - I'm not getting snappy! Uh, you are, a bit. Oh, you're such a traitor. Hey, hey, enough, look after each other. - We will. - We will. Let me know how it goes, Banana. I will, Mom. I love you. Love you too. Bye, Mom. You didn't tell her you were coming. I can't handle another one of her how long can you keep this up spiels when I don't get it. Valid question. Please. She wants me to go home. I don't want to. Get the film, then. If it was that easy, I would've done it already. Come on. Come on. It's not that hard. I did it when I was 11. What did you have to do for the audition, not wet your pants? Oh, harder than it sounds. I'll get you some adult diapers for Wednesday. Thanks. All right. Better get this dinner made. It's the only meal he eats these days. Please tell Philippe thank you for letting me have his spot in your bed. No, you tell him. Repeat after me. No, I'll lose concentration. Open your eyes! Rubbish, rubbish! That was so close. Basic, that's good. That looks wonderful. Hey, stop it. It's not bad. It smells delicious. Bon appetit. Ah, bon appetit. Bon appetit. Mmm. How is she, Philippe? Very good. No. No, she was asking how she is? Oh. Same. Thank you for letting me stay here. Say it. - I don't know. - That's fine. She's thanking you for letting her stay here. Don't thank me. Thank Jean. Okay, but still, thank you. So what happened? Nothing, she's just old. What did she say? She's talking about her audition. How old? 84. Okay. When is it? Wednesday. What's the film about? I think she is playing a prostitute. She gets her throat cut. She usually auditions for those kinds of roles. Don't you, Babu? What? Normally get cast as a hooker? Yes, or a crazy person. A whore, or a crazy person. It suits you! No, pardon. Just a joke, not funny, though. Okay. I didn't realize English films were made here. There's lots. You just don't see them. Will she have to act in French? Oh, Philippe is asking if you have to speak in French in the film. Say your French. My one French phrase. The little pot of butter. Very good. A very good start. Betty bought a bit of butter but she found the butter bitter... Teddy, she doesn't understand. It's just a tongue twister, it's a joke. Again, not funny. Oh. Did Jean ever show you any of his acting stuff? What? Mm, sorry, mouth full. Have you ever seen Jean act, act, no? Ah, no, no, no, no, no. Never, Jean has never shown me any of his films. He's never Never seen any of his films. He's never seen any of my films. You haven't? He doesn't want to. Did he not show you? No, no, because that's terrible, so stop it. Oh my god, that's so unfair. He's so cute. He's like the little French Macaulay Culkin. Oh, look, it's Babu! See, Philippe, he's so cute! Gee, stop it. Look at your little face. This is acting, look at that. This is acting. I can't believe you quit. You're such a quitter. Well, the castings just got more and more humiliating. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, the last one was for this energy commercial. Awful, got there, there were seven guys that looked exactly like me. Not even like my brother, like. How is Xavier? - Is he single? - Can you not? Stop it! Anyway, those guys did look like they had been made out of my rib, like, exactly the same. Yeah. So I go into the room and then the casting director says, okay, so hold your hands together. Do it. All right, hold your hands together. Wait wait wait wait wait. Leave a space between your hands, and now imagine that you're holding a tiny sun between your hands and that you're very happy because the sun is a natural source of energy. And now open your hands and release the sun. Release the sun. That, Anna, you would've got it. Of course. Anyway, I went out, called Stephan, and I told him that that was it. So dramatic, Babu. Honestly, I don't miss it. Really? Everyone has a breaking point. Can you hold me, Babu? Did you disappear, or did I? I did. After you. Sorry. It's all right. He's a good 'un. Yeah, he is. You seeing anyone? No, not really. Well, I'm just glad you're not back with Fuckwit. He wasn't that bad. Oh, yes, he was. Not at the start. Well, at the end. He wasn't great at the end. And now he's your landlord. It's close to work. Find somewhere else. - I will. - When? Soon. He's selling it, I got the papers a few days ago. Good. I don't know where I'll go. Well, to a different place, in a better area. Yeah. When you land this film. Sure. Have a bit of faith. I have nothing but faith. Don't be like that. I'm 26 this year, Babu. 2,026. 42,626. But it's like 18. Relax, I'm 29. Yeah, but you look like a sixyearold. Thank you. Orson Welles made Citizen Kane by 26. You made a onewoman show. You made it. Your corpse acting outshone me. What age does it get easier? 27? Let's go to sleep, Babu. Babu? What is it? Babu? Anna. There's no audition, I made it up. I mean, there is a callback, I just didn't get it. Okay. John's here in Paris. Oh, Babu, no. I just wanted to give him the lease termination papers in person. You did not come here to save on postage, Anna. I thought that if I just let things happen, the right thing would come along, but nothing's coming. You wanna go back to him? I was happy. No you weren't. Everyone's unhappy when they're in a relationship, and then they realize how totally miserable it feels when you're alone. He had sex with another woman. We were having problems. At your birthday party! I don't know that. I do, Anna. It was a difficult time, Jean, and you were drunk. Oh no, no, that's not it. No amount of grief or gin made me hallucinate him fucking another woman in the bathroom. That's him speaking, that's not you. He said they didn't. Well, they didn't finish, no. I don't care. It's gonna happen, excuses or no. You called me while you were fishing your shoes out of the bin and said it was the perfect allegory for how he treated you, like trash, you remember? I didn't mean it. He did, Anna. Please don't get angry with me. Why are you going so soft on this? I don't want to be angry, I want someone. Anyone? No, Jean. Being alone is better than being with him. I've been alone long enough. A year. Two years. 200 years. It's not funny, I want someone. Well, go out, meet people. I do, and they're just as awful. I figure, may as well choose the awful that made me happiest. That isn't right. You have Philippe, you wouldn't know. Oh, don't do that. Do what? Pulling the you're in a relationship so you wouldn't understand card. I was single for eight years. You're gay. So? That means I don't get lonely? No, it's, it's just different. How? I don't know, it just is. Touche. You know what I mean. Well, I'm incredibly lonely, if you must know. You wouldn't believe how completely unsexy I find him. I don't see how that's possible. I'm serious, Anna. It's hard, he's grieving. Every time he cries I just think of him as this small kid I got stuck taking care of. And I don't want to. I don't see how it's gonna work after she dies. It will. I don't want it to. I don't have any sympathy for him, at all. He can't see that she's an old woman that should, and is dying. Babu. And she had a long life, she had a great life. He should be happy. But he's not, he's sad, Jean. It has never once occurred to him how I might be feeling about it. Have you told him? No, no. I don't want to be the me too guy. I hated those people when Dad died. If that's how you're feeling. And when he's not crying, he's banging on about selling this place. Hasn't it once occurred to him how I paid for this? I think you miss him. I don't dwell on it. It takes time to move on, Jean. He had a choice. It's awful, but you just accept it. Philippe keeps making more drama for himself, and I don't understand that. Don't see him, Anna. He won't help. Life is painful enough without hurting yourself. Promise me? Okay. Promise. I promise. I'm counting on you. You hate dependency. Well, I'll make an exception for you. I love you, Babu. And I love you too. Your hands are all clammy. Oh, fuck off! Hello Miss. Coffee? Yes. May I? I'm waiting for someone. Oh. I came through there. What? I came through the door, a few minutes ago. I'm, I'm waiting for someone else. A man. Ah. Other than you. Naturally. I'll wait with you, for the man. Until he comes? And if he doesn't? I'll keep waiting. And do what? Read, think. Of the man? Yeah. Tell me something. When you are with the man, do you think of him? Of course. So it makes no difference if he comes or not. Of course it does, when he's You, you just said you think about him when he's not here. And you think about him when he is. There is no change in you whether he's here or not. I'm happier when he's here. In your thoughts. In everything. You could easily think he's here. Well, he's not. I am. I'm not with you. Because you're not thinking of me. I'm thinking of The man. Yes. Will you ever stop? I don't want to. Yes, but will you? In time, yes. And who will you think of then? Thank you. I Should eat something. Yes. Anna called. They've given her some new pages for the audition. Go and help her. Sure? Do you want to stay over tonight? I heard it's bad luck to sleep on couches. The night before and audition. It's chaise lounges actually. Sure? Call me if you need anything. What are you watching? Absolutely stunning. You wonder where they get it from? Is it for you? Did you post it? Yep. Were we good? The best. You were bloody magnificent. This boy! Oh, the Gabriel, Gabriel, give it to me, give it to me Oh, no no no, I can do it, really I can. Papa, put down the camera. Congratulations my son. Family love. That was great, so great. In English. Gabriel, Gabriel, how was he? He knew how he was. But you would've done a better job, yeah? If only. Okay, enough lounging around. We're going out tonight. To the cinematheque? No, Babu, outout. I didn't bring any goingout clothes. Am I gonna see Philippe before I go? I'll make sure he cooks on Wednesday. Only if he's up to it. It's that or risk you setting the kitchen on fire. Get a smoke alarm. Oh, wow. Boobs got big. Don't you mean my ass? Who's that? Hi, yeah. I know, yeah. No, no, it's tomorrow at 10. Yeah. No, I was thinking the same thing, that's great. No, nothing in the afternoon. 4:30 would be fine, yeah. Oh, just hang on, hold that thought, I'm just gonna see if I... Shit. Hold on one sec. Jean, do you have a pen? No. No, I don't, sorry. Yeah, just text it, that would be great. Okay. Yeah, I look forward to it. No, I know, yeah. Okay, all right. Bye, bye. Who's that? Therese. Who's that? She's a girl from London, she did get the callback. Why are you meeting her? I think she just wants to tell me how it went. Well, don't make it a long catchup. Philippe is going to cook, I want you to be there for it. I will. What do you think? Of the dress or of you? Me in the dress. Get it. And the shoes? Well, they're high, Babu. They're comfortable. They are. Can we do my hair as well? Did you get the middle bit at the crown? Yes, Princess. Okay. Let me look. Do you want to do your eyebrows too? With this? Yeah. Won't I look like a manga character? Just a little won't hurt. All right, let me do it. I'll do it. Hi Teddy, it's me. You ok? No, we're still working on it. What about you? Okay. Anna wants to know if she'll to see you before she leaves? Really? That'd be nice. Text me when and I will get what we need from the shop. 11, I know. Get some sleep. I love you. Oh. What? You're such an idiot. Why? Come here. That will stain your skin. Ugh. I knew you brought goingout clothes. So who are we going out with? Some gays. Which gays? Pierre, Thomas, Alexandre, Francois, Chloe, Lisa. Hey, everyone, this is Anna! Hi, everyone.

I've invited Peter and Marie for dinner tonight. Okay. Marie got a call Someone made an offer on my apartment. That's great Teddy. Half way there. Now we just need to get yours sold. Yes, almost there. It means though that in a month and a half I'll be homeless. How should I put this? I wonder if it might be possible that I could stay with you.

It must be from when I was dyeing Anna's hair. Is it permanent? I don't think so. If it's dye Jean, by its nature it's permanent. So? So it doesn't look professional when we're trying to sell. And Marie is coming on Wednesday for the photos. It's my home Philippe, it's not meant to look professional. Yeah I get that! I get that it's your apartment Jean! If it doesn't look good we're never going to sell it. Fine. I wont. Where are you going? I'm calling the hospital. What am I meant to be doing? Keep stirring. Fuck! Bonjour. Bonjour. Anna, Tess. Tess, Anna. Anna's from London as well. Perfect, exactly what your ego needs. Another one that's come all this way for you. She doesn't speak French. Oh? She isn't here for the festival? No, she's here for me. Sorry, Anna, I was just saying, John thinks we both came from London especially for him. Didn't you? Not especially. Tess is your competition, Anna. You auditioned as well? Oh, right, yes. You? This morning. She looks nothing like the brief. They always try out different physiques. Just trying, I'm sure. What can I get you to drink? A red is fine. A glass? Or a bottle, if you're. Nope, don't encourage her. She's incorrigible. So, did you graduate last year as well? A bit longer ago. When? '08. So did you test for the older sister? No, the younger. I thought the reader was great. Really made a difference in the scene. Mm, for sure, yes. How do you know Jonathan? Jonathan. I rent his flat in London. I thought he said he was buying a flat. He is, he's selling the one that I'm in. Out with the old. Yes. And you? He's friends with my agent. He's got me seen for a few things, he's a really good contact. I'm sure he's been more than just a landlord for you. Of course, he's very supportive. To old friends. Perfect. Lucky I was just leaving. Good luck with the role. Oh, thank you, and to you too. I'm sure if neither one of us books it, this one will be willing to put himself up for the consolation prize. Seriously Tess? You know you've got this one booked. I'd better, or don't bother calling once you've moved. No chance of that. Bye, Anna. Bye. Hi. I'm sorry about that. No, no, it's fine. She seems lovely. Yes. She's... No, no, she's very young. Doing very well so far, it seems. She's had a few good breaks. Lucky her. I wouldn't be too worried. She's not a scrap on you, she's very mannered. Don't you mean British? Exactly. Cheers. Cheers. So. And how are you? How's the festival? It's good, it's good, it's very busy. But lots of stuff you'd like. Like? Oh, everything. Oh, well, I'm going back tomorrow, so. Oh, shame. Yeah. So no chance to see anything, then? No, I was flat out with prep for today. I'm sure you'll get it. Pull some strings. Oh, I would, if it would make any difference. But no, what I meant was that you no longer have your bad luck charm holding you back. Ah, it has taken a while to lift the curse. I'm very powerful. Like Kryptonite. Thank goodness I'm now immune. Oh, before I forget. Ah, yes. For you. Thank you. You've been a great tenant. Give me a good reference. Absolutely, the best. I'm sorry that it's on such short notice. The new place came through pretty quickly, No, no no no, that's fine, no problem. Do you know where you'll be going? No, not yet. Home? London is home, John. Are we okay? Of course. Anna, I don't want there to be any animosity between us. There isn't. Seriously. I know I didn't treat you very well. I want you to know that. I do. It was just a difficult time, you know, for all of us. Yes. I know. Right, onwards and upwards, then. Right, onwards and upwards, then. Right. I'm so happy that you stuck it out. You deserve this. They flew you over here, Anna, you should be very proud. Thank you. I am. Is your new place a one bedroom? - Two, actually. - Oh. For a home office. I'm AP now, did I not tell you? Wow, John, that, that's amazing! Congratulations. Thank you, thank you. That much be so much more trouble. Well, it is. If you thought I was never home before, you'd barely see me now. I bet they put you up in penthouses, though. They do. Oh, hardly. Still singles. Never quite had your talent for swindling upgrades. I never swindled! - Oh, come on. - I never swindled. It's just gentle persuasion and lots of eyelash batting. Oh, what, like this, something like, something like that, hm, please? - Stop, stop it, stop it! - Please, please? Are you blushing? No, I'm not! You are blushing, look at you. I don't believe it, I've never seen this before. I'm not. Wow, this is a first. Stop it. It's nice to see you. Is it? Yeah. It's the highlight. Where have they put you up? Oh, I wanted to stay with Jean. He's selling his place as well, so you know, last chance to see it, and. Of course, yeah. He's invited you for dinner tonight, if you're free. No, I'm not, actually. I thought not. I have the show. Yes, yes, of course. Yeah. I'll, uh. Now? No, I'm just ducking to the loo, if that's all right with you. Oh, right. Duck away. Thank you very much. John? Yes, Miss Henderson? You don't think there might be a spare ticket to the show? What about dinner? It's my last chance to see something for the festival. Well, we wouldn't want you to miss out, would we? No, as long as it's not too much trouble. For you, never. It seems that I'm not important enough for another ticket. Oh. You should've told me earlier. I just presumed that you'd be out drinking with your new director. Tess probably beat me to it. Probably. I could meet you after the show, if you'd like. - Uh. - Uh, no, sorry. You're seeing someone. No, actually, I'm not, no. I was, but not any more. No. No one? Right. You should call me after the show. If you don't want to say goodbye now. Would you like to say a proper goodbye? What does that mean? When I went to the bathroom, I noticed that there was a locked cubicle. That's a proposition and a half. I think I'm too classy a lady for that. Oh, of course. - No, it's. - Oh, God, no, sorry. I should never have said anything. It's fine. No. Of course we should see each other afterwards. Yes. Of course. I'd like that. I should get going. Me too. Okay. Okay. I'll walk you to a cab. Or we could split one. I hired a car. Oh. You could give me a lift, if you like. Wait, John, stop. Let's go back to your hotel. Can we go back to yours? I'm staying with Jean. Is he home? Yes. Let's just go back to your hotel. We can't. Why not, is there someone there? John? Is there? Who? I'll drive you home. I love you. Stay with me. She's close. She's really close. I know... just. Oh, hang on, I'll just, I'll just put that, there. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. Oh, I'm sorry. That's all right. Oh, God. Won't you be late? It's just Jean and his friends, you should come. I can't, I can't miss the show. Can you drop me? Where is it? Montparnasse. That's the opposite direction. Oh. Look, there's cabs just down the road, Look, there's cabs just down the road, I can watch just to make sure you get one. I can watch just to make sure you get one. Call me after it finishes. I will. Yours. Thanks. Sorry, it's. Sorry. I love you, John. I love you too. Ah, there she is! - Hi. - Hi. Marie was about to eat her chair. I was not, Jean. Oh, sorry. Come, come. Sorry, this is Anna, everyone. Marie, Peter, and this is Agnes and Marc. I'm Anna. Hello, Anna. Sorry for the ambush, but Philippe has just sold his space today, so we're having a little impromptu dinner to celebrate. Congratulations! That's great. So how did you go? Are we having dual celebration? Sorry? The big audition. Oh, not sure. Let me get your wine, sweetheart, come with me. What's going on, Babu? So Philippe still thinks you had the audition today because we've been rehearsing all night. Babu. What? You want him told about Therese? And now the Boeuf Bourguignon. Boeuf Bourguignon. So, do you audition a lot, Anna? Oh, I don't do too badly, maybe once a week. Commercials, mainly. - How much? - Could be making 10 thousand. Pounds, 8,000 pounds for the commercial. So, Anna, when. When will you find out if you were successful? Well, the costume director actually said there would be other lead actors in town tonight, so I might be meeting them after this. Okay. For another audition? I guess to see if we have the right chemistry. Okay. Really? That sounds exciting. Yeah, so it depends on if he calls or not. Will he? Yes. He's saying that... Never mind. Mmm, delicious. You were joking right? About what? Who would you be meeting? Therese. She might have a spare ticket to a festival show. Starting at, what, 10? It's a cabaret. Someone's taking their clothes off tonight. Ha ha. Anna? - Anna? - What? What? Can you put this away, please? Sorry. You two, she'll make you jealous. What? Anna and Jean sound like a married couple. Jean must be getting some practice in. For what? Nothing. Sorry to interrupt the dinner... don't worry, it's nothing bad. You all know that the last month has been very hard for me. And I want to thank you all for being here. It's important that I say this to the people I love. Stop it. It's in these times you know who your real friends are. I love you all. Cheers to love, to life, and to you, my friends. - Cheers! - Cheers! Anna. Yes? News? Not yet. Please. Fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy night. Hi, it's me. I just wanna let you know that I have rebuilt my life with integrity and dignity and I think that what we did this afternoon was incurrent, incorrect. Goodbye. Stop manhandling me, I know how to walk. I'm not, Babu, I'm helping you. He didn't call, Jean. That surprises you? Why do you find it so hard to believe that he could love me? He doesn't, Anna. He can't be there when you need him, so he's certainly not going to be there when you want, either. Oh, Babu. I slept with him. What? Please just listen. Oh, why would I? Well thanks so much for your support, Jean. I don't support stupidity. Of course not. Well, if I'm stupid, what does that make Philippe? No, no no, 'cause he has no idea what kind of man he's really dating. What kind of man is that, Anna? The kind that fucks random strangers. Would you keep your voice down? No, I wanna know why is it so bad if John does it to me, but it's fine if you fuck around on Philippe? You don't know what you're talking about. Don't I? So I imagined you picking up that random guy last night. Same as I imagined John fucking Penny in the bathroom. You enjoy this, don't you? No, but you do, Anna. You love it when I act like this because then you can pretend that your life is so perfect and you never make bad decisions or do bad things. You don't need to act anything, Anna. You love rejection more than you love yourself. That's you. Without me to prop you up, you're just one glass of wine away from tragedy, and you know it. You think that John is bad for me, but the truth is you're worse. Go, celebrate the house you're never gonna buy, Jean. Sorry! Sorry! Actors! Wait! Stay, we haven't had dessert yet. - No we should go. - Bye. Philippe. Call me, okay? Just us. So I guess she didn't get the part. No. That's too bad. That's fine, she always bounces back. She must be a good actress. You think I'm a fucking idiot? Marie translated everything! What? I needed you. You don't need me, you need a nursemaid. And what, you needed a fuck? Who was it? Is that important? You're right. It's not important. As long as he doesn't think, or cry, or feel. As long as he doesn't have any problems. You can't just use people and rid when you don't need them. Just throw them away. You can't do that. Did you ever ask yourself how any of this affected me? No, because you never talk or open up to me, so how could I know? She's old Philippe. Twice as old as my father, and you think it's easy for me? To be in that hospital? I don't want to go through that again. I can't go through that again. You're not through it Jean. A relationship means taking everything, the bad and good. And I know it's hard for you. I haven't been the easiest, person to live with, and I'm sorry, but I need you! You know what's hurting me the most? You understand and need Anna. You don't need me. And yes, my mother is old and she's dying you don't need to remind me of that. Do you know what I do every day at the hospital with her? I hold her hand and I'm there with her. I don't cry, or moan, or beg her not to die. I stay by her side because that's where she needs me. Did you make them? No. We broke up. Probably. I was a real dick. Yep. Jean. Jean. Did you talk to Philippe? Do you know why I painted this? I hate rhetorical questions. Shall I tell you why you hate rhetorical questions? When your dad died, I was really embarrassed. You were going through the worst thing that I had never experienced, and I had nothing to say. I couldn't tell you that I understood, because I didn't, and I didn't want to say that I didn't understand, because that's just useless. So I hid. And I thought it was okay, because you have your family, and they're the people that are gonna say all the good and useful things. And when I came to the wake, every person was telling you stories about Gabriel, about your mom, about your brother, about sticking together, about time. Everyone was talking, except you. And I knew the one thing I could give you is space. A space where you can write shitty things or missing things or loving things or no things. A space that is here for you whenever you need, that won't hate you if you don't. That was my job. I know you think that he wants an answer, but he doesn't, he just wants you. I thought I would have acted so much better than this. You do what you can. I was an asshole. If it's any consolation, I was an idiot. Well, you were an asshole slash idiot. How's that? You came here for John, idiot. You lied to me about it, asshole. That's idiot slash asshole. That makes a difference? Well, I'd rather be stupidly malicious than maliciously stupid. I'm the latter. You don't have to be, Babu. I can't, Anna. Okay. You don't have to take advice from me. Well, you did just have sex in a toilet cubicle. I didn't, actually. In a rental. Hideous. Being there is hard, Jean, but not being there is worse. Believe me. We should wait downstairs. You didn't have to come down. I'll take this out. Here. An addition. Keep? Throw. Got everything? Yep. Come on, Fat Legs. Thank you. Ooh, get out. Oh, Babu. What? I'll be super quick. Babu, they don't wait. Thank you for having me. Any time. Always. Bonjour. Bye, Anna. Hey.
