Can we slow down? What are you late for, Farish? If we cook an oxtail soup properly, the meat will slide off easily from the bone. This triggers a different sensation on its own. Different foods stimulate different sensations. They say it depends on the dish, and on who tastes it. And, some say, on whom we share it with. But I think, it's a notion invented by the romantics. That everything has to be enjoyed with the right person. That it makes it more special. Why should I wait for the right person, to enjoy such a delicious dish? When we talk about food, we're observing people's personality. A dish can tell us about the person who is enjoying it. Fina, early pregnancy. But she doesn't know it yet. Chris, trouble with his marriage. Nia, low blood pressure. Don't forget your ticket, passport, and documents. All right, sir. Arya. Where are we on the Japan package? That's Mr. Burhan. He takes other people's opinion personally. He's too sensitive. -Aruna. -Yes? Confirmed. Irma's the one going to India. Help her prepare the data. Ask her what she needs. Okay? Okay, Sir. I'm going, Chef. -Have you finished the soup? -Yes. Not too salty, next time. If you finish that much soup every night... Bad for your blood pressure. Bad for my blood pressure. Okay. Bye, Aruna. Bye. Bono. You're still making your cooks eat up wrongly prepared dishes? I was going to end the rule. But they insisted. But you'll end it eventually, right? Or I could make them suffer more. You're a lunatic, Bono. Bono never fails to amaze me with his cooking. Look what he's preparing for me now. Who am I to deserve such a heavenly dish? He's not my boyfriend, nor my family. Since you're not going to India... I'll bring India to you. Nad says this is one of my masterpieces. Dig in. A different kind of spice. That's it? The masala salts are different. It's from Jaipur. Then, what else? What else? I give up. Something is wrong with you. Seriously. I think you need a vacation. You used to be so happy-go-lucky. Now, you're like on the brink of depression. But I don't feel that way. Don't you want to be like Nad? Here we go. She's living life to the fullest. She's not waiting for joy. She's on a quest for joy. As you can see, she's glowing. Twenty four seven. Like a goddess. Don't you want that? Let's do a culinary trip. I need new ideas. Inspiration for the menu. You barely have time for a culinary trip with me in Jakarta. Let's make it happen. I'll take some days off. -Really? -Really. -Seriously? -Seriously. -No joke? -No joke. I'm serious. Research has shown that Indonesia is facing a threat from a new, never-seen-before mutation of an avian flu virus. The virus is smart enough to form a potent antigen to attack human health, and it will continue mutating. Hello. Hey, Aruna. How are you? -I'm fine. -Long time no see. -Have a seat. -Noodles with meatballs? Of course. The best kind of balls. Have you read the report? Yes, briefly. Burhan said it's been a while since you did field work. Out of town. So you're the right person. For? An investigation, of course. An investigation on this? You know avian flu is not really my forte, right? You're an epidemiologist. But you barely deal with epidemics. What do you say? You want an answer now? Not immediately. After I finish my noodles. Aren’t you supposed to be happy? You get to travel while working. Check out the local cuisine. Just as we plan. It's not that I don't want to do it. But our company, One World, has had a few projects with PWP2 before. And they never took the projects seriously. Nothing has ever come out of them. What's PWP2 again? I forgot. You have so many clients. Epidemics Control and Infrastructure Recovery (PWP2). You didn't forget. I never tell you. So what happens to our culinary trip? That's the thing. How is it? Still not there yet. Just give your mom a call. I'm sure she has the recipe to your maid Mbok Sawal's fried rice. Impossible. My mom never even cooks. So now, you'll be working while taking this trip with me? But you'll be investigating alone, right? I'm thinking. Can I squeeze work between our culinary stops? Sure you can. A girl's gotta eat, right? -But you seem to enjoy my fried rice. -I'm hungry. Besides, you asked me if it tastes like Mbok Sawal's fried rice. Not whether it's good or not. -So, where should we go? -What do you mean? Where will your work be taking you? Surabaya, Pamekasan, Pontianak, Singkawang. Isn't Mbok Sawal from Pontianak? She's Javanese. Can't you tell from her name? No, as I remember, she was born and raised in Pontianak. Her family migrated there. Really? How come I don't remember that part? Come on. Okay. So we're still going, right? I'll help you look for Mbok Sawal's fried rice recipe in Pontianak. It might actually be a local fried rice. What are you doing? Modifying your dish just a bit. You said it was good. I didn't say good. Dealing with avian flu is not easy. If we said it's not a crisis yet, they'd see us being incompetent. But it's a strange case. I looked at the data. The people with symptoms, live far away from each other. Surabaya is here. Pontianak is here. So far away. I had a feeling about this. About what? You asked me out to lunch to refuse the assignment? We're talking about human beings. PWP2 has the funds and initiative, but we're the one carrying it out. And we're not taking it lightly. But if you don't want the job, I'll wait for Irma, to get back from India. I'll do it. But you have to know, the data looks suspicious. Only one sick person per city. Don't you find it strange? That's why we're investigating it. Wait a moment. How's your lunch? Good, right? Snails are the it dish now. Especially in Yogya. -Bono. -Yes. My schedule is pretty tight. In Surabaya, I have to go straight to the hospital. Okay. And I have to visit several clinics and hospitals. Plus, I have to investigate some farms. Some markets. And some restaurants. I've made a list. What list? The eateries we should go to. Such a long list! I'll be working. I can't go to them all. Just hold on to it. I'll select some priority joints. But Pengkang in Pontianak. This should be on the priority list. That's the only place to get Pengkang. Yes. Are you done? -Just a few more minutes. -The cab is waiting downstairs. -Okay. -Hurry. Let's go. -And the key? -I'm taking it with me. Sure you don't want to leave it with your mom? No, it's fine. Oh God, I forgot one thing. The ticket printout! Really? In this day and age? It's all in the app. Okay. Good day. Hello, Sir. -Miss Aruna, right? -Yes. So, how can I help you? I'm from One World, representing The Directorate of Epidemics Control and Infrastructure Recovery (PWP2). We're following up on the report about the avian flu patient. Fajar, 12 years old. His father took him home yesterday. I see. What was his latest condition? Fit enough to be released? No, but if the family insists on taking him home, our hands are tied. And someone was asking me earlier. About Fajar? No, about you. -Come again? -Who? Someone from PWP2 asked if Aruna was here yet. Who was it, Sir? You. No, I mean, who asked about me? I think his name is Syarif. Or Arif? Farish? Farish? Do you know any Farish? So was it Farish or not? You mean, that Farish? I only know one Farish in this world. I know a pop singer by that name. Not even remotely funny. So, he's working for PWP2 now. But why is he here? And asking about me? Is he trying to sneak in and secretly be my supervisor? Isn't that what he used to do? He used to be my supervisor at One World. So, no secret about that. Right, "secret" is more your department. Secretly having a crush on him. You mean like your secret crush, Nadezhda? That's not a secret. I told you, remember? You and Farish, that's only my hunch. From how you talk about him. Your hunch is wrong. Is it? Just drop it. I need to focus on my work. Focus. Sh*t. Farish! Hard to focus when it comes to Farish? No, he's here! He who must not be named. Even in your mind. He'll pop right up! Hi, how are you? Good. How are you, Aruna? Not too bad. -What are you doing here? -I... This is Bono. Bono. Farish. I thought you were alone on this work trip. Yes, I'm working. But he happens to be here with me. He's on vacation. Have a seat. Here? You don't mind? Can't have you sitting on the floor. Bono! Order something. -Is it good? -This is so good. Succulent meat. The soup is not too thick, but you can really taste the broth. And it's not too sweet. -Bono is... -Your friend, the chef, right? You mentioned him. I'll have another of this. So, my office sent me to work with you. Suddenly, they felt that this is not a case to be handled alone. Mr. Burhan hasn't told me anything. That's the thing. Miss Priya is just about to inform him today. Who is it, Bono? Nad. She's really here. Nad? Nadezhda? Guys! Hey! Why didn't you tell us that you were back in Indonesia? I don't travel and tell. Who's this? -I'm Farish. -Nadezhda. Hello. She's a walking fine dining main course. Everyone drools over her. Aruna's friend, or... We used to share a working space. Oh. And what are you sharing now? Just cut it out. Too obvious. You're such an idiot. Thanks for that. What did I miss? Nothing. Who? Farish. What's going on between you two? Nothing! Oh, my God! Next subject, please. Careful. Don't be too hostile. Hostility leads to sympathy. Before you know it... love! So, what's Farish doing here? He has a girlfriend. Idiot, didn't you hear the question? Thanks again for that. Aruna backed off after finding out he had a girlfriend. So, you had feelings for him? And before you backed off, did you even put up a fight? Who invited her, by the way? I did. Just a sec. -Hello? -Where are you going? I'm on my way to the hotel. To the hotel? -Where are you? -Right behind you. I'm going to the farm. Why don't you ride with me? Oh, okay. Okay? -Give me a moment. -Okay, cool. He's behind us? Yes. Farish is here to investigate with me. A plus one. Nice. Cut it out. When we get off the highway, pull over. B*tch. Hey. Patient showed similar symptoms to avian flu. High fever, seizure, and nosebleed. Do you find anything unusual with your chickens? Any of them dies suddenly? Is the number of your chickens down significantly? My chickens are all healthy. They also consume antiviral drugs. Aren't we being a bit much with this? Just follow the rules. He's not wearing one. The scared ones are people like you. What's the antiviral medication? Just an antivirus or for other diseases, too? I'll leave you alone. Thank you, Sir. So hot in here. Aruna. Just follow the rules. But the chickens are healthy. Tomorrow, let's just go in one car. What about Bono and Nad? Why didn't you tell the office you will bring friends? Okay, sorry. They just happen to be here. For a culinary trip. A culinary trip? But I promise you, they won't interfere with my work at all. You want to drive in one car tomorrow? Okay, but let Bono and Nad come along. We have to be more focused. This is not a case to take lightly. Look, I'm not taking this lightly at all. I'm a hundred percent focused. But you were also at the farm we just visited. Was there any sick chicken there? I rest my case. It's just one farm. We have many more to come. I know that, but you know what we're here for. To investigate. Not to spread fear. Based on the information we have, the boy had a sudden high fever and cough. His direct contact with a fowl that died suddenly strengthens the suspicion. As of this moment, we are still waiting for his lab test result. Fajar, my son, he is ill. Why did you take him home from the hospital? An illness is a gift from God. It is God's will that Fajar has to go through this. And only God has the power to cure him. -I understand, but... -Listen. An illness is not a misfortune. It's a blessing from God. I don't understand why people refuse such grace. Fate is final. Why change it? It has been written. What's this? Yummy duck. Nad, what are you doing back in Indonesia? I miss home. Yeah, right. Why do you think people travel if not for an excuse to come home? Anyway, here. Everyone's been asking about my second book. Who's everyone? My fans. My readers. I can do research for my next book. Bono and his ways. So, Indonesian cuisine? You will include everything in Indonesian cuisine? Yes. What took you so long? Where's Farish? Farish takes a long shower like a woman. What do you mean by that? Aruna takes quick shower. She never shower. But I'm so excited about going to Madura tomorrow. You're also coming to Madura? I have my eyes on the Lorjuk clams. Is this Madurese porridge? Have some Madumongso sweets. What's it called again? Peneleh. Peneleh. Peneleh, you know, Peneleh. Tomorrow we're going to Pamekasan. Say that word again. Where's Farish? He'll miss out on this. Well, let him. You'll let him see you with no makeup? Farish is on a diet. Things like this are why I can't scratch him off my list. We've had people inspecting before. Where are you from again? -I'm from PWP2. -I'm from One World. I will give you the same answer. There is no case of the avian flu here. We are still crosschecking some data. Our ducks are all healthy. So, you also have a duck farm? He's so paranoid. Reminds me of you. Will Bono and Nad be joining us? We're the ones joining them. For the Lorjuk clams. This is different from bamboo clams? It's different. They are bigger. How long do live Lorjuk clams stay fresh? Live ones? One day. -Still fresh? -Yes. -They're only available in Madura? -Yes. -Nowhere else? -That's right. This is our local delicacy. Thank you. You should have this in your restaurant. But with better presentation. I agree. What do you think? Doesn't it just make you happy? This should be served in a restaurant with sad people as patrons. Is it because the Head of Healthcare Center -just gave a hard time? -Impossible. It's impossible you don't like this. There's something wrong with your palate. Farish, try some. I'm allergic to clams. Mr. Musa, do you keep poultry at home? Or are there fowls around where you live? No. I live in the middle of nowhere. The nearest neighbor or food stall would be 30 meters from my house. I'm still around because of Mrs. Roh. She found me unconscious. Is this her? No, that's my wife. Mrs. Roh sells Pecel around the village. My wife passed away two years ago. I'm so sorry, Sir. Thank you. She loved cooking the Soto Lamongan. She would prepare it in the afternoon, boil the chicken, and wait. Then she would stir fry the ingredients. Smells fantastic. It makes you drooling. When the chicken is ready, she mixes it with the fried ingredients. Shredded chicken, broth, koya sprinkles, and a dash of lime. Celery, fried garlic, and chilli. The Soto Lamongan is served. Tastes good? Nothing compares to it. My maid used to cook fantastic fried rice. Really? But I don't know what ingredients she used. I tried to cook it over and over again. It's never the same. Some dishes are meant to come from one person. Aruna. Let's not engage patients on personal conversations. Mr. Musa hasn't had anyone to talk to for years. Exactly. Once you start, he'll never stop. He will just keep rambling. Look, Farish. I know you're a doctor. But you treat fowls. Fowls may have no problem having no one to talk to for years. But human beings, we'd go crazy. We could even get physically sick. But seriously, I still can't put my finger on this case. What are you supposed to do here, anyway? I have some data. My job is to go and crosscheck the data. Whether the data matches the condition in the field. Where did you get the data? From PWP2. Transferred to One World. I think I need to update Mr. Burhan. -One moment. -Who's Mr. Burhan? The Boss. Boss at PWP2 or One World? Oh God, I'm just here to eat. Yes, just enjoy your meal, Aruna. This is really good. Mr. Musa said nothing beats his wife's Soto. How is Mr. Musa related to Mr. Burhan? For God's sake! Okay. Food comes first. Looks like he has a controlling girlfriend. He's always on the phone. Are you sure it's his girlfriend? I told you. He has a girlfriend. That doesn't look like a girlfriend. Looks like an affair. You mean he has two girlfriends? Of course not. I'm saying, Farish is the paramour. His girlfriend must be married. Nonsense. You can see from his gestures. I could be wrong, though. And when it comes to men, Nadezhda is never wrong. Is it just me or does this taste so-so? Really! I don't know. Yesterday I got a lecture from a patient's father. He said medical procedures are opposing his religion. Then he said, a sickness or misfortune is a blessing. Religion and science are like oil and water. They don't mix. The Big Bang Theory. You don't know it? The universe was created out of a massive explosion. It's in the Quran. A verse in Adh-Dhariyat. But how does it apply in real life? We've heard about vaccination not being halal. Or the birth control pill controversy. Religion and science just don't go together. That's why, I only believe in food. Sorry, come again? Food is universal. It's the most indisputable experience and reference. Let me explain. Life is just like food. In just one plate, you can taste the most bitter flavor, or the saltiest flavor. If you eat the items separately. But, if you take a little bit of everything in one bite, Only then will it reveal its true self. Aren't you all worshipping food as God? I have a question for you. What's your opinion on food? My opinion on food. I don't know. It's food. It's black and white like Math. Whether it tastes good or not. To me, its purpose is clear. For my hunger. That's all. I thought you were complex. Is that so? I thought you were simple. After this, let's try the Pecel and duck noodles. Yes! Before we leave for Pontianak tomorrow. You're coming to Pontianak, too? Aruna has feelings for Farish. Yes, but she won't admit it. So typical of her. You know what I think? They're like champagne and Rendang. Who's the champagne and who's the Rendang? Obviously, Aruna's the champagne. I wouldn't call my best friend a Rendang. What's wrong with Rendang? -Besides, your point is not valid. -Really? Have you ever heard of the fusion genre? Two mismatched food items that go well together. But it's hard when one of the items won't admit it. Thank you. We haven't tried the Rujak Soto here. I mean, You want to try it tomorrow morning? The Rujak Soto? Come on. Do you still have cash? No, I paid for dinner, remember? How much do I have? Two bucks? Sir, will two bucks get us to Tunjungan Plaza? Sorry, no. How much? Three bucks. Oh, no. Can't you help us out? Sorry. Let's check it out. What for? Come on! Welcome. Aruna Rai speaking. We misdiagnosed. He died not of bird flu, but pneumonia. We apologize for that. Aruna. Yes? Can I tell you something? Sure. What is it? I feel that... The data we have doesn't match the condition in the field. I know, right? Do you think so, too? Actually, I do. I thought I was the only one. Honestly, I don't know what to expect from this investigation. But, you know. Let's see where this goes. See where this goes? If we do that, it's like hoping our data is valid. It's like hoping all these people have bird flu. No, that's not true. It's not what I'm thinking. So, in your head, we're actually in the middle of a bird flu epidemic? No. No wonder you're so paranoid. You make people paranoid. Do you know paranoia is contagious? The bird flu epidemic is real. Yes, with fowls. With people, we're still investigating. Yes, we are. So there you go. Okay. Salty. Bono! What are you doing here? Get up! Get up! Come on. What? Get out. -Hey, Farish. -Hey. -Can I sit here? -Okay. I thought you hate hotel food. Not interesting. Nothing worth discussing. Not all food items have to be discussed. Besides, sometimes ordinary things can surprise you. And sometimes, ordinary things are just ordinary. Yes. When Aruna and I were colleagues, I don't remember her talk about you. So, at work, you told each other everything? Then, you got a girlfriend, and everything stopped? She already told you that much? She only told me that much. Old story. How old? About two years ago. Two years ago, I was seeing this guy. Adam. His wife had cancer. It was impossible for him to leave her. So, on our dates, because we knew we didn't have much time, We made a pact not to wear watches or check for time on our phones. We decided to forget that time exists. He now lives with his wife in Belgium. They run a cancer foundation there. So, his wife survived? Totally cancer-free. You can be so comfortable telling me about your affair. No affair is a hundred percent a secret. This is Soto. The Rujak is totally upstaged. They shouldn't have mixed in the first place. Like a couple not meant to be together. They become better people when separated. Farish said if I were a dish, I would be... What did you say I was? Tell it to Aruna and Bono. What? What you said at breakfast, I'd be a Lemper. Right. I suppose Aruna should sit in front? This is their rental car. Why do you object? Aruna should be fine. Right, Aruna? Or do you want to switch seats? No. I'm seeing heaven. You're right. Amazing noodle texture. The crab, Bono. And the crab eggs. A treasure among the noodles. I feel like moving here and never leave. Ever! Don't forget, we still have to find Pontianak fried rice after this. Now? No. Now I have to work. Can I tag along? I've always wanted to see you work. What about me? Left alone? Everybody can come. You're only allergic to clams, right? No problem with crabs and prawns? So, we can only take a boat to this market? It's the fastest way. Or you prefer swimming? Have you investigated here before? I'm used to going to markets. You've been to a market, right? You're the one who should've brought up his clam allergy. Why? You got a problem? I know my writing style is not very... This is great. I thought you were not into this kind of stuff. I'm not, but... It's probably the writing style. Miss Aruna. Mr. Farish. Not all of you can come in. Just the ones investigating. Sorry? Thank God, Mr. Burhan replied my email. Mrs. Siti, we have some questions. Do you keep any poultry at home? Or any fowls around where you live? No, Miss. Just when I go to the market. And only on weekends. Because my husband likes to have roasted chicken. Any other sick people at home, other than you? No, I only live with my husband. We have no children. But, thank God, my husband is healthy. May we speak with him? He's out of town for work. I'm all alone here. But he calls me in the evening. Almost every night. Just like when we were dating. Sometimes, when he sleeps... Mrs. Siti's husband left her for another woman. That's why she likes staying at the hospital. Bird flu facilities are free of charge. Not a problem. The room is not used, anyway. I wonder what the other woman is like. I really don't understand. Mrs. Siti is a perfect woman. That's irrelevant. People fall in love, that's all. An affair is an affair. -How much for the food? -Yes, Sir. How much? Aruna. You have no right to judge people. And you're never in Mrs. Siti's shoes. How's the fried rice? Good, right? Still, it's not the same as... Mbok Sawal's fried rice? Yes, but it's not bad. How does Mbok Sawal's fried rice taste? What did you talk about? Fried rice at the port. I told him I was looking for the kind of fried rice you told me earlier. He said, we can find it at the port. You're so nice. Asking around for Aruna. Have you read my report, Sir? Yes. I'm still reviewing it. So, how? The first patient hasn't confirmed his disease? The 12-year-old boy from Surabaya. I've confirmed it. But I haven't received an answer. Okay. Just wait then. Aruna? Yes, Sir? Is Farish near you now? Not really. I'm starting to smell something fishy about PWP2. Miss Priya's reaction when I told her, about how the data doesn't match the reality. How did she react? I'll tell you later. We have no case here so far. But, the headquarters sent you all this equipment? Yes, that's right. Can't this be allocated for other medical purposes? Such a waste. It's not for me to answer. Besides, the vaccines are only for poultry. Not for humans. So there will be vaccines for people? That's what I’ve heard. State-of-the-art equipment. Completely wasted. -Thank you. -Welcome. What's taking them so long? Be patient. They're working. You said you and Aruna were here for a culinary trip. No. Their work is the main reason. You sound unsure. Except for one thing. Dessert, anyone? What's wrong? You know something? At least so far, we haven't found any bird flu patients. Weird. Corruption, Nad. What? Corruption! Can you go out later? Isn't it a blood bath each time you have your period? Lately, not too bad. Really? You found the right medication? Herbal drink. My mom makes it for me. Your mom can make herbal drink? That's so cool. You sure she can't cook? Herbal drink takes skills. It's different. A baker is not the same as a cook. I'd like to learn how to make herbal drink from her. Or, I'll interview her for an article. Do you mind? Do you even drink herbal stuff? Not regularly. So what do you take regularly? Oh, I know. Birth control pills, right? Bitch. Not anymore now. So, how do you keep from getting knocked up? Condoms, of course. Do all men carry those? I do. It's a package. Condoms and sanitary pads. Nad. Do you always have sex with the men you date? That's as far as I get, really. I'd like to get further, but I can't. How much further can one get? Walking hand in hand. Taking a trip together. Go for single men, then. I'm tired. Good night. The sauce needs more zest, though. This time I have to disagree. I think the combination of sticky rice, prawn, and clam sauce is genius. Authentic and smart. I'm not saying it doesn't taste nice. Why are there other special teams here? Many of them, Farish. What do you mean? Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Not PWP2. Do you really think so? Don't you realize you're spreading fear? Terror? You, me, us. By being here, we create the impression that a bird flu epidemic is happening. So, the money will follow. What are you trying to say? It's all about the money, Farish. You mean, PWP2 is... Well, I don't know. Maybe it's your superiors. And you're just a pawn. My superiors? Priya? Miss Priya, you mean? Yes, Miss Priya. I don't know. Most likely. I'm sure it's not like that with Priya. What do you mean? Tell me. Why did you leave One World and move to PWP2? What are you getting at? You know. All of PWP2's projects have been somewhat fishy. Especially those managed by Miss Priya. Then, what are you doing here? Oh yes, I forgot. You came all the way here just for a fried rice recipe. Eating around town with your friends. Right? From the very start, you've never taken this case seriously. Do you know, Farish? This reminds me of the small roads in the Balkans. They're just like this one. Look to your left. Amazing sea view! We should've just hired a driver. Can we slow down? What are you late for, Farish? Oh, God! If you want to kill yourself, don't drag other people down with you. I need to change. Change what? Are you having a fight with Farish? Do you think Nad has feelings for Farish? Bono. Can we please not talk about trivial things now? Nad is never trivial to me. Don't fall down, idiot. I'm getting off here. Sure you don't want to go to the hotel first? Bye, I'm coming with Aruna. Actually, I need some time alone. Bullshit. No one wants to be alone. So, what's the problem? Work stuff. I know. But, what? I don't understand. How can he not suspecting anything? He works for PWP2. He might just be assuring himself that his office is clean. Why are you defending him? Do you have feelings for Farish? Are you talking about yourself? Bono likes you, Nad. But, he's not challenging enough. I like challenges. I don't get it. You get a rush in secret meetings to find those little flavors? No. The challenge is convincing myself that I'll be fine if one day he decides to return to his wife. Don't you feel jealous? Don't you feel you deserve to have him? His wife deserves him the most. She was there first. People like me are paying the price. Those in high places have nothing to lose. The problem is, it's too serious to be a casual project. But, it's also too far-fetched to be a serious project. According to regulations drugs, vaccines, and health facilities must be provided through auctions, except in the case of an epidemy or a disaster. As of this moment, there has not been an epidemy. Not even one. We need more patients to call it an epidemy. You were right, Aruna. Too late, the cinema is closed. What were you saying? You were right. This is all made up. Engineered by the headquarters. To get funding. Vaccines for humans. We know the vaccines are for the poultry. That's what the hospital staff told us. Yes. SHOWTIME TONIGHT Who's your girlfriend, Farish? Excuse me? Two years ago, your girlfriend, is it still the same woman? Two years ago? Yes, when we were working together at One World. We spent so much time together. Working late. Then, one day, you told me, "Aruna, I have a girlfriend." Is it still the same one? You were so surprised back then. And you said, "Farish, don't distract me from work." Right. Then, two months later, you moved to PWP2. For God knows what reason. And I still don't know who your girlfriend is. Still the same one? It's complicated. FOR RENT She's much older than me. She's married. She has a child. Sometimes, when I see people, I wonder, Do they keep secrets like me? What's their secret? -I'm also keeping a secret. -In the mood for noodles? What were you saying? Want to eat there? No. But I'm in the mood for Choi Pan. When I was about three or four years old. My mom taught me how to play chess. She taught me the moves. Then she told me, come on. Attack the Knight. Eat it alive! I didn't know what to do. So, I literally ate the Knight. Do you think I was a weird kid? I'm always weird when it comes to food. So, you play chess? Only because my mom does. So, does it taste good? What, the Knight? Silly. This is delicious. How's your palate? Is it better now? I think so. Way better than before. I wonder what Bono would say, about eating a chess Knight. Is it salty? Tasteless. Don't skip your meals, Sir. Get well soon, Sir. Excuse me. I quit. Farish. What did you mean? Do I need to spell it out? I quit. Quit the assignment? Or your job? Everything. Miss Priya? Hi, Aruna. When did you get here? I arrived in Pontianak last night. Then I went to Singkawang. Here. From this point on, I'm taking over. It's a decision from PWP2. One World is off the case. In the last city? Really? Good news, right? Now you can enjoy the city. Enjoy the food. Okay. Aruna! You must've told her about my suspicion! -I didn't... -She popped up out of nowhere. It's even clearer now. PWP2 is covering up something. I didn't tell her. You realize something's not right about your office. We should've discussed our next move. Instead, you ratted me out to Miss Priya! I didn't tell her anything. She could be a part of this game. Why did you tell her? Okay, it was me! I told her about my suspicion. Not yours! But, you've been so good at keeping your stupid secret for years! Why can't you keep this one from her? I can't believe this! Stupid, you say? You don't like me calling it stupid? You can't mix work with personal matters! You're the one doing it! I can never understand why you told her. Okay. About Priya. Miss Priya? -Priya. -What about her? Aruna. Oh, my God. Your girlfriend is Miss Priya? What's eating you? Miss Priya, the PWP2 boss, came here. She took over my work. And, she's been dating Farish. And? Bono. PWP2 is involved in corruption. Farish lets her use him because he loves her. And you? You let Farish mess you up because you love him. No! Yes. No! Yes. What you need to do first is be honest with yourself. -What are you talking about? -You know I'm right. You can't even be honest about your feelings for Nad. Why are you judging me now? Hey, why make this about me? -Who's the coward here? -You're the coward! Why are you being like this? -I'm going to Pontianak. -What for? To find my fried rice. That's all I'm here for. Not for you. Not for Farish. You're so selfish! Aruna! What's wrong, Aruna? What is going on? I should be asking you. What is going on, really? I'm not that naïve. Why are you talking nonsense? Good thing I came here. Go on! Go on with the investigation. Go on making up fake reports. So, I can go back to Jakarta and enjoy the food. Where are you guys going? Pontianak. To find Aruna. Aruna went to Pontianak? -Why? -You know damn well why! I'm coming, too. Aren't you on honeymoon with your girlfriend? I'm here to work, Bono. Not like you. Here just for the food. Don't you go looking for Aruna! Go back to Miss Priya! You misunderstand, Bono. From the start, I've been here for Aruna. -Thank you. -Hey, wait! Oh, yes. The key. This one. Thank you. Which motorbike? This one? Aruna. I hit Farish today. Then, he went looking for you. But, that's not why he went looking for you. He said, he came here for you. By the way, I'm going to tell Nadezhda how I feel. Soon. Do you think I shouldn't have hit Farish? If you see Farish, tell him I'm sorry. And, sorry about earlier. Nadezhda. What? I have feelings for you. For God's sake, Bono. What? Men don't just tell women so bluntly. Be more romantic. Romantic, how? I don't know. You're the chef. Hello, Aruna. Can you hear me? Yes, Mom? Finally. You never answered my calls. Your herbal drink is ready. Really? Thank you, Mom. Where should I deliver it? To your office or home? I'm in Pontianak now. Pontianak? So far away. For work? Looking for Mbok Sawal's fried rice recipe. Why go all the way there? I know the recipe. You do? That's my recipe. I taught Mbok Sawal how to make it. But, you don't even cook. Because you always told me not to. Mbok Sawal cooks better, you say. Alright. So shall I hold on to your herbal drink? Yes. What else do you need? Aruna? I have to go. Thank you for telling me. I'll call you later. No need. Just pay me a visit. Get your herbal drink, and I'll make you fried rice. All right then. Bye. Where are the others? I don't know. Aruna, I really don't know why Miss Priya suddenly showed up in Singkawang. Maybe she panicked. That people will know what's going on. But, the point is, it's all over. Everything? Everything? Everything. I'm so bad at separating work from personal matters. I'm sorry. They don't always have to be separated. So, what are you doing here? We... We have to do something. But, it won't be easy for you. Us. It won't be easy for us. Let me tell you. Before we do something, anything, I have to tell you something. Actually, when you were still at One World, I had feelings for you. Well... Me, too. My culinary trip didn't bother our work, right? -No. -Okay. What about me being here? -Hello! -Have you ordered, Farish? No. Doesn't taste too good? Mind if I take over, Sir? My girlfriend prefers I cook for her. Be my guest. I haven't said yes, you know. Shut up! AVIAN FLU CASE NEWS ON AVIAN FLU CORRUPTION SCANDAL Guess what? Salted fish? Hey, it's Pengkang. -Did you make these? -No, delivered from Pontianak. What else are you going to serve? Pontianak crab noodles and oxtail soup. Lorjuk? Lorjuk is out of season, so I replace it with bamboo clam. What else? Fried rice. Aruna's cooking. Smells so good. Hold on. Be patient. Ready? What do you think? How did you do it? With all my heart. I already have your heart. Don't be a jerk! Food has the same power as the universe itself. It connects us to all kinds of people. People we hate. People we fall head over heels for. It's not only creates new stories. But, it also creates many new possibilities. It will be more perfect if we enjoy it with people we love. This is home. This is precious.
