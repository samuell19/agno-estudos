(wind whooshing) (dramatic foreboding music) (man knocking) (dramatic foreboding music) (guns firing) - Ah! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) - [Billy] Killing is not something I enjoyed doing. It's just what I had to do to survive. (jazz music) There's two sides of me. One side loves money and power. The other side wants a simple and honest life. It's hard to live both sides. I love this city. But I'm just getting tired of this dog-eat-dog world we're living. Dealing drugs happens to be my profession. A profession I would have chosen different, if I would've known back then how life would be today. (water boiling) Today is gonna be a beautiful day. Let's make some money. (jazz music) (car honking) - What's up, man? - [Billy] Hurry up! - - Oh, Fuck up man. How you doing brother? Let's go over here. All right man. - [Billy] This is my partner, Tyrone, a womanizer and a drug dealer. He and I grew up together. He saved my life when we were kids. And we've been crying partners ever since. (footsteps squelching) - [Mr. Brigante] Yeah, I'm gonna get home. I promise you that. Hey, nice to see you again, Billy. See, business is good? - Business couldn't be better. - [Mr. Brigante] Good doing business with you, Billy. You're a man of your word. I like it. - - Same here. Same here. Hey Tyrone, let's go. - You got good tastes in a women there, Mr. Brigante. - [Mr. Brigante] Thank you, Tyrone. Yes, take it easy man. - [Billy And Tyrone] Alright. - [Billy] Too much love can really make a man lose touch of reality. My client, Mr. Rodrigo had a bad case of it. He had all the money in the world but money could not buy him happiness. (dramatic music) - She's so beautiful. - [Billy] What do you want done to? - His legs. (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (suspenseful music) - [Billy] $5,000 was an average man's salary and I made it in the day. But is it all worth it? I don't know. (car revving) (distant chattering) - What do you want to drink? - Scotch. - Billy what's up, man. Stay here, I'll be right back. Man, where you've been? Like, you ain't calling me my brother back man. I've been paid you, I've paid you, y'all like you don't like me or something. - I've been here, well. - - Oh man. Look, Rufus is looking for you. - I don't know, man. I don't do any of that small time shit, man. - Jeez. - - The money's no good. - Come on man, small time, man. This is a big time, man. This is Alfredo brothers. - Hey is that Ricky? - [Tyrone] Oh yes, that's her. You know, I don't know how you manage to juggle all these women. - Who? Them? come on, man. It's called lying and it's also called money. I need some more money, man. I'm broke, man. You gotta kick me down with something. I don't know. - How much do you owe me already. - Does that matter? I'm your friend, man. Come on now, give me some more money, hurry up man. All there's people around and I'm all broken up and my brother look along, you know, toe up. Come on now. Come on now, you don't need to count that. Come on, come on man. - That's all I got. - Hey, well you can get some more. You know I have a hard time keeping cash in my pocket. I gotta go. - Back there. - - I will, hey. Don't forget the car roof for now, man alright. Hey, who loves you baby? - You do. - That's right! Ha ha. - So you've got my money? - Oh, hell money baby, you've got me. How are you gonna need money, huh? Hey, can we get a drink bartender come on. (distant chattering) Thank you. Can you open my beer? What's up! (dramatic music) - [Billy] For the first time in my life I started to feel alone. Something is missing in my life. I wanted someone. I could talk to. Someone I felt connected with. Having these feelings with drug addict women, just don't cut it anymore. - So what do you do Billy? - Me? What do I do? More alike, deal with a lot of street gang here in Los Angeles. - Was that a part of the poverty program or something? - Yeah, yeah. Poverty program, street gang. All the same thing. - And what exactly do you do in this? - I help, kids deal with their social problem. Yeah. (dramatic music) (car revving) - Hey Billy, check this out. When done getting gas here. Let me treat you to a Tommy's Burger. - Nah, I don't touch that stuff, too greasy, you know. - Man, you don't know what you're missing. - You see that stuff when I first arrived here in LA. - Listen Billy, I got this job and I need you to back me up. I'll go half with you tomorrow night. - How much? - 10 G's. - I'm in. When? - Tomorrow night. Nice ride. Damn. (upbeat music) (door thuds) - Hey, where are your gun? - Nah, I don't need gun inside. Nobody handling pistols are better than me. - It's okay Tyrone, you need to stand point. - Man, why do you always pull this shit? Every time something's about to go down. That's what I'm worried about and if you get shot, Billy owed me 20 bucks. - So, what's up? - How it's going? Couldn't be better with this stuff, man. - Turn around. - Who's this vato? - This is Billy, a good friend of mine. - He's clean. - So you got the stuff? - Yeah, I got the stuff. - Mind if I have a cigarette? - You got the money? - Yeah, I got the money. (suspenseful music) (indistinct) (guns firing) - You wanna mess with me? (guns firing) - [Policewoman] West 28, (indistinct) - Let's go. - What happened to let him live? - He didn't make it. - You owe me 20 bucks man. I told you. (car revving) - [Billy] Judy, my little sister was the only family I felt connected to. - - Hey, Billy! Wait wait yeah? Stop it Billy! - Was that your boyfriend? - - No! Wait, yeah? When? - What are you doing here? - Just came to visit. See how you guys were doing. Why can't you forget about the past? - How could I forget about the past? I toss and turn all night. Trying to forget about it. Mom was killed by somebody like you! Now tell me how could I forget a thing about that? - I love mom and dad as much as you did, Jeff. - You are selfish! - If I could change things, I would Jeff. But I can't! You understand, I can't! - Can't you two just get along? - You had a choice Billy. You just don't want to change. You just didn't want to change. - Billy. I want you to have this. (dramatic music) (car revving) (guns firing) - Mom! Mom! Mom! I love my mom. You only tend to realize how much you really love someone until they're gone. (car revving) - Want a beer man? - Yeah, thanks. - Were a job Billy about that? Bad deal the one down with Rufo's death, man. (indistinct) Look for the dude who stole their money. - Yeah, so let them look. - You know, you just watch your back, man. You're getting hotter these days. Get another problem. One of our clients is refusing to pay. - And why does he don't want to pay? - Well, ever since he made friends with the Alfredo brothers, he thinks he's big shit now. - Well, we just have to fix that, won't we? - Well I say I miss this, exactly. - Get his wallet. - Don't kill me, man. Please don't kill me. - How much does he have? - A lot of grand? - Take it. - Just don't kill me man. - [Billy] Shut up! - - Just don't. - The next time you're late on your payment. You die, just like that, you understand? - Yes. - - You die, just like that. - Hey come on man, let me mess him up, come on. - Mess him up. - Do you know? When did this happen? Uh huh? Why wasn't I told about it? Well, it's bullshit! You know what I mean! Junior! Junior! Close that refrigerator and get your fat ass in here! - Yeah, yeah. What's your problem, man? What do you got crawling up by this time? - Hey, who is this Billy guy? - Billy? Oh, he's some dealer from the East side, some Filipino. What's it all about? - Well, he's a dealer on our side? sticking my money, our business. I want you to brought him and I want you to brought him now! - Calm down, you gotta get a heart attack. - Hey don't you tell me calm down. How the hell do you think I get all this shit around here? Get, get in there! Junior. - Alright, I gonna call him right now. - What have I become? (guns cracking) Anne was an old girlfriend of mine. She was the only girl I ever fell in love with. - You told me yesterday, you were gonna stop. I saw you down there. You beat the crap out of that guy. Why? Because he didn't pay you up? - Hey look, if I let one asshole off the hook, then every single asshole let their grandmother would be blowing me off. - Don't you see, that's not what this is all about you believe Billy. That means you can die. You, even though you can't get that simple factor in your skull, I can't. - Nothing's gonna happen to me. - I believe you Billy. Only because, I wanted to believe in you. - I'm getting out. - You said that yesterday. Don't say things you don't mean, okay? - Listen, I love you. - You don't love me. You love your work. (dramatic music) - [Billy] I yearn to have a family and just lead a simple life. Have a wife and a son. I enjoyed watching kids, they give off so much happiness. Something I lacked in mind. - So it was the new girl. Oh man. That's needed man. I met her at the gases. She spent some gas up. McEntire, you know, bring her along for the ride. - You're always with a new girl Tyrone. - You know how it is man, I need to keep up my image. (indistinct) what's up? - It's all there. (indistinct) you gonna do it real fast. You got the sad puppy dog look on your face Billy. - I look like that? - Yeah man. - [Billy] You're kidding, right? - No, I'm serious. What you need to do is go out and get laid, man. That what you need to do. Man look out! Look out! (guns firing) (car revving) - [Tyrone] Damn. Come on man, we need to get out, come on! - You bastard! You've killed my baby! - Don't you ever steal from me. (dramatic foreboding music) - [Billy] Look at my world. These guys find their happiness hanging out drinking. 10 years. And what am I? I have nothing solid to show for it. What are you doing? - [Woman] What do you think I'm doing? - You're too young for this. - I'm 14 years old. - That's right you're 14 years old. - Damn Billy, we just want to try to have some fun. (distant chattering) - [Billy] Having friends and someone to love is what I wanted. The sad thing about it is, in my circle of friends. It's impossible. - What! - Amber, this is not a toy. (indistinct) - What's the matter with you? - Hey man, where do you think your going man? - Hey we're talking to you. - Sup man, you think you're bad? Give me your money. - [Man] Get back over here. (indistinct) - Hey get his money! Get his money! - What's up man, you think you're bad? Sup! - What's up man, you're trying to get crazy? - He owes Kuziak's money? - Yeah, Kuziak Fernando Makilah and he hasn't paid him back since. You know he's selling Kuziak's dope, don't you right? Right? Shit. (indistinct) - My favorite place, you know I'm saying? - What an asshole. - Tyrone, who is this? (indistinct) - Who is this? - - I don't know! - Is there something we need to discuss? - - No, you need to sit down. - Cause I remember seeing this woman before. - Billy, girls. Girls, Billy. - Tyrone, I gotta talk to you. - Right now? - [Billy] Yes. Now. - Billy, come on. Just try not to embarrass me, man. - Excuse me ladies, but I'd like to take a moment of Mr. Tyrone's time, if you don't mind? - Okay, you can take a little moment of my time but let us not too much time now, right? Hey bartender, get the girls drink, put it on my tab. - You never have a tab man. - Well hell, put it on his tab? - Tyrone? What are you thinking? - What do you mean what am I thinking? - Who do you owe money to? - I owe money to nobody, man. - Don't lie to me. - - What are you talking about? Who do you owe money to? - Come on, I'm not lying to you at all. You believe Ricky? Come on, you can't listen to her, man. (indistinct) Come on, you're tripping out, man. - Kuziak. - Kuziak? What about them? I don't know about nothing. - You owe him money. - No, I don't. What's up with you man? Why are you tripping like this? - Tyrone? You know I know you. So why don't you tell me what I need to know. - All right man, all right. Look, look, okay. I'm trying to make a little side cash, all right. I've got a little something from Kuziak, you know? But, no big deal. I ain't scared on Kuziak. - Kuziak is one dirty cop you don't wanna mess with, you understand? You'll take it back. - All right, all right, fine. - Listen, I can always watch your back. You gotta think Tyrone. You gotta think. - I'm Sorry. I'll take it back and no big deal. - You don't need side cash. You get greedy. It's going to come back to you. Big time. Control Tyrone. Just control. Control. - - Control. - Discipline. - - Discipline. - And focus. - - And focus. - We can show them discipline. Ladies! Ladies! Come on in here. - What baby? (indistinct) - Now this is a control and this is discipline. Hey, we've got to loosen up baby, loosen up now. (car revving) (guns firing) - Okay Tyrone, why did you bring me down? - What do you mean why bring you down, man? Yeah, Alfredo brothers got a hit on us. - I figured this will happen. What do you think we should do? - What I think we should do? Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! (guns firing) - Who the hell does this guy think he is? - You want me to take them out? - This guy is good. - Shut the fuck up. - All I'm saying is. - I said shut the fuck up. - You got lucky, it won't happen again. - I want to meet this Billy vato. Tony, go get the car ready. - Okay, okay. So I used to be a drugs. But that was a past. I don't do that anymore. I'm just helping out an old friend. - Just stop it, will you? - Anne you can't just walk out on me like that without giving me a chance to explain. You just don't understand how it is to survive in this world. - Billy, I come from the real world. I know where you come from, I'm not stupid. You lied to me Billy. The poverty program? There's no such thing, is there? Huh? - Um, Not exactly. I mean, I just don't know how many poverty types I have to deal with every single day. - You're just afraid. Some day, some bad man like you is gonna come in and break my heart. - No, not me. I will never break your heart. (dramatic music) (indistinct) - [Billy] This is Dave Kuziak. A dirty no-good-cop. What he does is steal from drug dealers and sells them to the Alfredo brothers, which they re-sell to the streets. - Fine. Listen, will you do me a favor? Let's go Tyrone. - I like that, I like that. - We brought the garbage here for you. - All right. - Merry Christmas. Happy birthday. - - [Bad Cop] All right. - Now go spend it all in one place.

Come on, man. Come on. Come on, man! It is not funny, man. Come on, I got everything you want, man. - One more chances. Let me get this straight. Let me give you a kilo of Coke. Somebody tells me that you're using and entertaining all the ladies with it. What's up with that Tyrone, huh? Can you explain that to me? What is that? And then when I ask you for my money you tell me, "Oh man, I don't know. I'll get you. I'll get you. I don't know." All these lame excuses. You are nothing but a no good, Coke-head a goddamn liar. And what makes it worse? Is that you're a thief. - Oh man! Ugh! - [Kuziak] Oh man. - - Why are you playing, man? This is not funny, man. Come on man. - Can't you feel the rush? Oh man! - I don't do drugs man. I've been to rehab and I'm sober man. Come on man. - - Goodnight Tyrone. Goodnight. - - Come on, man. No! Come on man!

But I tell ya, I found you once and I can, and I will find you again. Bye bye. - [Tyrone] I need to get out of this. (dramatic music) - Goodmorning Kate. Can we get up for school? Katie, get up. You know, if you want breakfast, you have to help me. Now, get up. Katie, I'm gonna be late for work now. Get up. - Give it back. - You get it back when you get up, now get up. (dramatic music) - Billy, I want you to have this. - So what do you do Billy? - You had a choice Billy. You just didn't want to change. (distant chattering) ♪ Sometimes ♪ ♪ You know it's get lonely baby ♪ ♪ If you need me ♪ ♪ Oh girl just call me ♪ ♪ And I come baby ♪ - Hey lady, still open? - Sorry we're closed. - I'm kind of hungry. - Billy? So, you're going to stay if I get back, huh? - Sure is. It becomes my soul. Hey Anne still piss off me? - I get over it. - What you've been doing? - I've been working a lot. Trying to pay the bills. - You know what's weird? All this time, I was thinking getting, stab, going in prison. (indistinct) But now I'm getting this, weird dream, you know, bad dreams of being tortured. - So maybe it's time to get out in streets? - I'm not on the streets anymore. Don't matter. It makes no difference. Somebody is always on my back. - Billy, I gotta go. - Can I call you sometime? - Let me call you. You said you loved me Billy. - I know, I'm sorry. (distant chattering) - What took you so long? - You know me man. Just fooling around. - Now, don't smoke it. Sell it. - All right, I will man, you know me. What's up to you man? Why y'all looking sad lately man? What you need is some women. - I look like that? You're kidding me, right? - No, I'm not. I'm serious, man. Look at you. Y'all look at all sad man. I can get you laid if that's what you need. - No, it's not that. - I know this great little strip joint. It got fine honeys there. In fact I saw Anne in there. - Anne works there? - Yeah man. I don't know how you ever cut that honey loose. She is like, she fine. - Nah, women are headaches. - Not in that man, it's all how you look at it. Maybe headache for you. But it's a pleasure for me. Cheer up, man. (slow rock music) (slow rock music) - Hey. - - Hey. - This is a surprise. - Yeah, big surprise. - What's the matter? - Oh, nothing, nothing. I just didn't know the situation. - Yeah, well you haven't been around to know the situation. My parents died in a car accident two years ago. Made me an instant mother taking care of Kate. - Why this Anne? - Do you know how expensive it is to take care of a kid? - There are other jobs Anne. - Sitting there judging me and I don't like it. - Wait a minute Anne. - No, you wait a minute. - Will you just give me a chance to talk? - Did you kill anybody Billy? - I got your point. - Good. - Where are you living? - Well, I got a place in Hollywood. (jazz music) - You still have my picture? - It never, release my sight. - Look Billy, everything is gonna be alright. It's going to sit over a bottle of champagne. So he's got a business proposition for you. I just sent you the back, all right? - Billy? Tyrone? - It's all right, it's all right. You're with Tyrone now. No problem. - Billy, are you listening to me? - Why don't you go tell Tony to screw his brother, alright? - Excuse me sir, it's from. - Send it back. - What are you doing Billy? - Send it back. Every now and then a new player comes around working his way up the ladder. Trying to buy in on my friendship, trying to get in on what I got. But I see through all that. - Champagne's not to your liking? Chardonnay perhaps. - No, thanks. My mama told me, never accept gifts from assholes. - You know who goddamn I am. - I don't give a shit who you are. - I say she was at the wrong table. - I say, she's not. - Sheila come on. - [Billy] I do what I do to maintain respect. And Tyrone always had my back. In the same respect I had his, I never had to question that. It's the law of the street. He did for me, so I do for him. - Anyway, listen, I got a favor to ask, you know. - I gotta go to the bathroom. - Stay here, we'll be right back. - What's up Tyrone? - Listen, man. The mob thinks I stole $50,000 from him, man. Listen, I know this cop who lives in the Hills, right? All we have to do is go up there and get a lot of dope. A lot of money, inside the desk drawer. All I have to do is take it. - Oh, come on Tyrone. The cops are after my tail already, man. I got to lay low for awhile. - Come on Billy, man. I need you on this man. With this one, exactly not stealing man. And it'd be like, you don't want to go bar on it. That's all. - Man, what's got into you anyways? We're drug dealers not thieves. You know that stuff's gonna kill you. - Come on Billy man. Forget the stuff, I need you, man. - If I do this, I'm doing it for you, all right? Because I owe you. - Thanks man. I really appreciate this man. - Wipe your nose. (dramatic music) - [Billy] It's really strange how life works. When I was a kid. - Hey, there's Billy. - What's up dude. - That's how I grew up. We can't be on the side of the fence. I love you. - I've got you something. - Oh yeah? Surprise? - Yeah, surprise. - Oh, I love surprise. - It's not that. Close your eyes. - Why? - - Close your eyes. - It's better be good. - Open your eyes. - Hey Mario. - I'm gonna go to bed. - Mario, where the hell are you man? Last time I heard you're in jail for 10 years. You want a beer? - Yeah. I could use some cold beer. - Have a seat. You haven't calling me these days. - I'm sorry, I know. Billy, remember all that crazy shit we used to do when we were young. - Yeah, how could I forget? I was a lot older than you too. - I looked up to you back then. Of you even, used that Coke bottle, that showed me how to put on a like condom. - I remember that. - I came back here to say, thanks. - I thought you had about 10 or 12 years in the cat. - Nah, they let me out because it was too expensive to keep me. - It's too expensive to keep your prison? - Nah, not exactly. See, I need a new liver. I got stab. I mean, I was late paying my cigarettes and then I paid for what? A kidney. - I'm gonna help you. I helped you before, I'm going to help you now. Say anything you need, you just come to me. Hey, you want cigarette? - Yeah, yeah. (suspenseful music) - Man what is that? You're selling me out man? You're my own flesh and blood man. I considered you my brother. You never rat on your friends. I'm not gonna shoot you. - They made me do it, man. You're not gonna understand. But you have everything. Man, I was the big disappointment. I'm fucked up, I messed up. - Just look at you. - Man, look at you. With your beautiful girlfriend, living in a beautiful house. Driving a BMW. You are everything I wanted to be. My family? They didn't show up to visit me in prison when I got sentenced. I am shit. I am shit. I'm no good in the can. They said they gonna send me back, Billy you not understand. - Who sent you? Who sent you! - Tahitian taskforce. - I gonna kill you. Just get out of my face. After that night, I started to realize how little friends I had in the world. My own cousin, was a snitch. What's this world turning into? Tyrone, what's the matter with you, man. You got stuff all over you. Don't your mama take care of yourself. - No, I'm just powder my nose, you know? - Man, that stuff's going to kill you one day. - Life is short Billy, you know, life is really short. - Excuse me Billy, is everything all right in here? - Everything is fine. Thank you. - Billy, can we go now? - Whoa, what's the matter with you. Anyway, me and Billy got some business to discuss. - It's Billy and I. - Yeah, whatever. Anyway, we're still on, right? - Yeah, we're still on. - I just want to make sure, I don't want you to backing out now. - Yeah, drop it. - Okay, okay, I just trying to cover, you know, cover everything. I mean, he's coming after you, you know? - Are you going somewhere? - Yeah, me and Billy have some business to attend to, okay? - Let it go, Tyrone. - Okay, okay man. I'm just trying to make sure all the bases are covered. I mean, before we'll make this deal. - What deal? What deal Billy? - Anne wait! Don't you ever, ever talk that trash again in front of her. I'm gonna kill you! - I love you too, Billy. Jeez, what's got into him? - I don't like him Billy. I didn't like him the minute I met him. - He's a good friend of mine and. - Was that asshole manipulating you into. - I'm just helping him out, that's all. Because I owe him. - You owe him? He's a Cole kid, Billy. I can't believe you hanging out with that guy. He's going to get you killed. I thought you were getting out. - I am getting out, but it's just not that simple. - No, you don't owe him shit. You just think you do. That's why people like you never get out. - You are not listening to me! - You're bullshitting me. Everything you said is bullshit. All your talk is bullshit. Your dream are bullshit. - - You're not listening to me. It is just how it is. Right or wrong. - Whatever it is Billy. Don't do it. Please. (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna check the room upstairs. Hello Dave. Fuck you Dave. (guns firing) - Damn Tyrone. Tyrone, what the fuck did you do? Let's get out of here. (cars revving) I've got to get out. It's not worth it anymore. It catches up to you sooner or later. Man, what the hell is wrong with you? - What are you talking about, man? If ain't kill him, he would've got me. You're the one talking about striking first. Shoot, man. - The girl. - What about her? Screaming as hell? - She was innocent Tyrone. - Innocent? Come on, man. Even the innocent still talk. - To drugs, man. It's gonna get you killed. - What's wrong with you, man? The Kmart haven't closed out on your conscious of something. I'm not used to you acting like this. Man, I think you turning like a wuss. - Oh, oh, I'm the wuss? I'm the wuss? Who's the one that makes the money around here. You smoked it before you can even sell it. I'm the wuss! - Yeah well, at least I ain't staying, running around here panicking and stuff. Man, I don't know what's gotten in you, but it's not like you've never seen somebody getting killed before. What is going on? What's up? - Tyrone, you lied to me. You are making my world smaller and smaller. I'm out there. I'm out! - What you mean you out? Out of what? What are you talking about? What else you going to do, huh? Tell me. - Damn it, I hate this business. - What else are you gonna do? You've been acting not yourself lately. - I'm just worried Tyrone. You're the only friend I got. And I'm worried, you're not going to reach the age of 30. But you're on your own from now on. (car revving) - Tie him up. - Got your boyfriend. - Ah, so you're the infamous Billy. You're a hard guy to find Billy. Billy, Billy, Billy, calm down, Billy. You've killed some of my people. Cost me some money. I should kill you. But I'm not going to, cause I like you. - Get to the point. - I want you to join our organization. - Why me? - With your skills and contacts. You could run the whole drug organization in LA. - I'm planning on retiring soon. I got to think about it. - I'm not a man who likes to wait for too long. (indistinct) I swear, I've seen you somewhere before. Where are you from? - [Billy] I remember this guy clearly. I'd never seen you before. Alex Alfredo, was the biggest bully in elementary school. - Take him home. (door thuds) (car revving) - You don't owe him shit. - You don't wanna change. - I want you to have this. - What else you gonna do? - You've killed my baby! - That's why people like you never get out. - [Woman] Are you sure about this? - I'm positive. - So, what's you wanna do? - I can keep it. - You can't do this by yourself. He's definitely not father material. Don't worry about it. We'll deal with it. - I don't. - Speak of the devil Billy's here. She doesn't wanna see you. - I need to talk. - Billy, she doesn't wanna talk to you. - Please. I know you were right. I know you're pissed off at me. Please. - - There's nothing to talk about Billy. - Anne, please, I'm getting out I swear to God, I'm getting out. - I'm late Billy, I'm late. - Well, I'll take you there. Where are you gonna go? What? What do you mean you're late? Where you, you're pregnant? - Not for long. - Wait a minute Anne. We've got to talk about this, please. Anne, listen to me, I'm really getting it out. Listen, we can get out of here. We can get out of this rat race, let's fly to Boracay together, come on. - What are you gonna do for work? - Well, I'm getting some money. We can open up a restaurant over there. - What about Kate? - Of course she can come with us. There's a great school over there for her. Please Anne. Look, we have three plane tickets for us. Three, we can fly tomorrow. - It's happening so fast. - Please Anne, please, listen. We just gotta get out of this rat race. It's the only way out. What do you say? - Okay. - All right, okay. Say goodbye to whoever you have to say goodbye to. Okay? And meet me at my house tomorrow. I'm just going to pick up my money and I'll meet you there, okay? Pack my clothes for me, okay? - All right. - All right, I love you. - I love you too. - They took down little Ray. He took him down. You're not going to do anything about it? What in the hell are you guys gonna do about it? Yes? How many times do I have to repeat myself with you, huh? - Well, don't. - Whoa, whoa, let's go! Out! Out! Out! - Fine! - Know what man. Get her out! - I hate you! - You better eluded bitch outta here. This building has been more trouble than any two bit hustler that I have ever met. - I think it's time to take him out of business. - You know Junior? I think you're right. - It would be my pleasure. - [Tony] What about his partner? - Take him down. But I want Billy brought back here. - Damn it! Why don't you just let me take him out? Why you want to bring him back here? - I said, I don't want him back here alive! - [Junior] Come on, come on. - You tell her to get in here and clean this crap up. (dramatic music) - Why are you not packing? We're going away. So you go pack your things too. What's the matter Kate? (indistinct) - Kate, you know I love you. You're my sister. We're the only family we've got. We're a team, okay? Now, go pack you things. - Can I bring my stuff animals? - You can bring one. - Can I bring two? - Okay, hurry up. Go pack your things. - Judy, I just came here to say goodbye. I don't know how long I'll be gone. I just want to say goodbye before I leave. I just want you to understand what I got to do. And give this to your brother Jeff. Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him that I do love him. Come on, now. You're gonna be strong Judy, okay? Be strong. Dear Jeff, I know you blame me for how your life is right now. I can't change the past. I've made many mistakes in this world and if I had a choice, I would have done things different, but I can't. I'm leaving for good. I hope one day you'll find it in your heart to forgive me. You'll always be my brother, Billy. (car revving) (suspenseful music) - What are these clowns for? - Hey, how are you doing there buddy? - How'd you doing officer? - [Police] Can you please shut your engine, all right? - All right, what seems to be the problem officer? - [Police] My partner will talk to you in a second. Why don't you keep your hands on the steering wheel. - All right. - Thank you. - Afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. - My name is officer Dickson and the reason why we stopped you is because you were speeding. - I didn't know it was going that fast. - So, if you just give me your license and registration. I'll be right back. - No, problem. - Oh, hey. - I'm just getting my wallet. It's in the glove compartment. - Okay. - All right. - No bazookas or anything crazy. - No, no, I ain't no criminal. - Okay, sit tight. - Run this guy from one to one. - All right, here you go. Don't speed up okay? - No problem, officer. Thank you. - Have a good day. - [Billy] I wasn't sure if I had been linked to Kuziak's death. It was just a matter of time when they will. I didn't even get a ticket. Now, That was pure luck. - Hey, there's Billy. (car revving) (suspenseful music) - Oh yeah, all right. - No, no, no, no. Get the hell out of here. - Wait, wait. - Get up. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Hey, get the door. (guns firing) (guns firing) - There he is. - That's son of a bitch is mine. (guns firing) Where'd he go? (guns firing) - Run on the other side. Billy! - [Junior] Take your gun off my brother Billy. Get on your knees. - Okay, we need to hurry. Flight leaves in an hour. - Kate, go get your coat. - Anne, I will never break your heart. Tickets? You got the tickets. - You've killed my baby! (guns firing) - No! No! - [Billy] I never knew it was going to end up this way. But there's always a reason for everything. I could have made Anne happy. I was so close. But I guess I did too many bad things in this world to have made it. - No! (dramatic music) No! - [Billy] I guess it's true. What you put out in this world is what you get back.
