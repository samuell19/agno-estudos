We're on the set of Lisa Ann's "Big Titted Cougars." Whew. Shocker that I would be in a cougar movie. What's the difference with a cougar and a MILF? My take is, a cougar and a MILF: MILF is supposed to be a "mom that I'd like to fuck." So I think that would make you a mom, right? I think a cougar is the same older seductress, but with no kids. So I'm glad to say I'm a cougar, or I'm a MILF with no kids, whatever you prefer. I feel like if you can't succeed in porn, you kind of can't succeed anywhere. 'Cause it's really not that difficult. It's a skill we all have. You're fucking for a living. People are like, "How are you the best?" Like, um, "I showed up on time every time." It's pretty hard to fail out of porn, but it seems like everybody does it. My last goal in my retirement letter was to write this book, and it'll be one year on Tuesday. So I did reach all of my goals. This is it. This is so exciting. Whoa. Okay. I don't want to hurt anything. I'm gonna open it very carefully. Now, everyone, this is so fucking dope. Oh, look. Oh! My first two years I was under contract with a company called Metro Home Video. And being under contract was an ideal situation for me because I wanted to feature dance. Back then, when you were the contract star, they made these glamorous posters and fliers for you, and they gave you as many as you wanted to go out on the road and use as marketing materials. You know, in the '90's when I started shooting, I was unaware that all of the movies a contract girl shoots are sold to cable, and cable was still a very big place where these companies made money. Cable didn't buy interracial. So I was unable to do interracial when I was under contract. People were telling me all day long, like, "if you do interracial, it's going to ruin your career. "No one's going to hire you as a feature dancer. You're going to make less money." I don't really think we should be choosing color of skin because we should be showing everyone the sexual experiences that we are having, and, of course, if there's couples that are interracial, they might want to watch interracial porn. And for you to not put that out for them, and they're a fan of yours, now they have an opinion to form. It's a mainly-- It's, of course, a mainly white business, all the company owners and the agents, and they all are secretly racist. So they all tell these girls not to do this. And then I'm the one telling these girls, "I've done more interracial than regular scenes, and I'm good." But it's a fear factor for a young girl, and of course, when you look up to your agent, he's been teaching you things, you're gonna believe what he says. Then when they finally do do interracial, when they're not getting enough work doing other things, they get paid more money for it. Going to the post office myself. 'Cause I want you all to get your books. And I want you to enjoy them. And I want to hear book reports, essays. So, if you want to put the boxes just down, and I'll put 'em in. I'll just have you photograph me putting 'em in here. Oh, shit. I just took a photo. Of nothing. All right. How many do you think I can put in at a time? More than that. Don't jam it up. Don't jam it up. These boxes took some getting used to making, you know what I mean? Like, the first ten, there's so much tape on them. Then I got a system going, you know. What does that mean? Is it stuck? Is it full? What do we do now? ls there another one? Yeah, the "Paylin" movie pretty much single-handedly changed my entire life. Sol have fans coming in not because they're porn fans, just 'cause they thought that was hysterical. I have people that, like, walk up to me now places, and they're like, "Right on," you know, "That was funny." So it's just-- It broke a barrier for me. Did you expect it when you first shot it? Did you think it was gonna go... That big? No. 2008 I was on set shooting a movie, and during my downtime I was checking my messages, and it was Drew from Hustler, and Drew said, "Hey, "we want to shoot a movie about Sarah Palin, and we want to call it "Nailin' Paylin." "Who's Nailin' Paylin?" which I thought was a great name. We want to use you, you're perfect for it. This is gonna kind of be a big deal. Privyet. We hate to trouble you, but I'm afraid we have a flat tire. We were wondering if we could use your phone to call the Kremlin. Oh, I'm sorry, fellas, I don't speak Russian. Kremlin. It means... - How you say? - Tow truck. Well, in the spirit of foreign relations, I'm sure there's no harm in me letting the two of you in. Come on in. You know, the business lashed out at me. Girls thought I stole that scene because someone else got the phone call at my agency, but I insisted I did it. It was really weird how when you get popular, people who were nice to you last week just, like, venomously hate you and are talking about you behind your back. And at that point I realized, "Okay, well, I'm gonna have this, "this is gonna keep me incredibly busy. "Fuck all these people. "I'm gonna be able to charge more money. "They already hate me. I know my value. I know what I'm selling. I know what I'm doing." When I went to strip clubs, I now had an older audience, a younger audience, a political audience, a gay audience, male audience, female audience. My range was so incredible, people walked up to me everywhere and they're like, "It's that Sarah Palin girl. It's that Sarah Palin girl." It was like, "This is it. This next four or five years" could set up the rest of my fucking life." Like, it's go time. We're gonna be on the road every weekend. We're gonna do 47 weekends a year. We're gonna do crazy personal appearances. We're gonna do tons of PR. Everyone was offering me these opportunities, you know? I remember getting invited to go to a couple good nude movie premieres, getting to go to some events. Those are great photo opportunities for me. And I knew that that is the way to stay relevant, to brand yourself to different fans, and to get yourself going out there in a social scene, in a different light with your clothes on. The more gigs I could do where it wasn't just about me fucking or being naked, the more I could cross-pollinate and start to get into what was gonna be my reality one day, being dressed. All these shows are on Sirius, so Sirius will hit me up, and one of the shows will hit me up and say, "Hey, so and so's coming through. Can you make it over?" 'Cause they know I'm that close. So I just get a shower, get dressed and go over. These are opportunities for me that are priceless, right? And everyone just treats me like, I'm part of the family 'cause I work there, and I have my own name badges, and they don't have to worry about security at all. And I feel like this little job has become the biggest opportunity of my life. Okay. I'm gonna put this plan in motion. It's gonna be a one-year plan. I'm gonna produce this many movies sol have this much content for my Web site once I retire. I was starting to plant the seeds that I wanted a sports show. I was already working for Sirius at that time out here in LA doing a very fun, sexy show called "Stripper Town." And by September 9th, 2013, I started my very first show with Sirius. "Lisa Ann Does Fantasy." It was my very first sports show. You know, I said to my girlfriend today, I was explaining this to her, and I said, "You know, you have kids and I don't." It's like being a proud parent. "When you're watching fantasy and one of your players does what you expected, "or even more than you expected, you feel like a proud parent." If a girl wants to get into the adult business now, what do you tell her? Um, I'd talk with her about why. You know, is she getting into the business 'cause she wants to explore herself sexually? She feels that she is more unique than someone else? Is she just a paycheck performer? If so, what is she looking to do, big picture? Because some girls think, you know, "I'm gonna work for a year or two and make some money and put it aside and then I'll do something else." And I'm like, "Yeah, you're not doing something else." You're gonna have at any other job, someone's gonna know what you've done." You have to be done with the business before the business is done with you. And, to many people, I've seen the business be done with them before they were ready, and it's devastating. Since I retired, I made a promise that I would read at least one book a week. And I feel like my brain was starting to go to mush because it was so easy to be the most successful porn star in the business because all I had to do was follow some really basic instructions. I don't think I could ever walk away from being Lisa Ann the porn star. I don't think there's a country that I could move to where it would be possible. I have to accept that what I put out there, and the amount of years that I put it out there, and the willingness that I put it out there, there's something to accept in return for the security that I've given myself, the way that I've been able to live, the adventures that I've had. The sidebar is, sure, everyone knows who I am, and everyone feels comfortable to approach me. You gotta understand something. There's a comfort when a guy sees me that's much different than when he sees a football player or basketball player. He has masturbated to me. When he looks at me, and we make eye contact, and that twinkle happens, and he remembers all those moments, it's a feeling, it's an adrenaline rush, it's a thing, right? I have to be so aware that I put it out there. Who would I be to say, "No, I don't want any of you to talk about this anymore. I want this to go away. I'm no longer her." I'm still her. I was naked. There's no shield I was wearing that covered me from being me. And I used my real name, so, you know. I am in porn, yes, but I'm also in the transgender industry, which is a very small niche. So in order for one to be able to excel and have an exit plan, you have to produce, you have to direct. You have to take control of your own brand and be able to dictate your own future. So, with that said, that's why I've worked so hard to get these accolades and be able to brand myself as a top performer. And eventually be able to develop my own modeling agency, and get in and get out, right? And have a family of my own. So, I'm 25 now, sol got a couple more years to go before I definitely want to have children of my own. lf l had my life to live over... It's out of the question. Oh, I know. But I'm just saying, if I did have my life to live over- What would you do? I would live a life filled... engulfed... consumed... by lust. - You would? - Yes. Engulfed? Consumed. With lust? Yes. What the hell, why not? There's little enough to do around here. It'll break the monotony. Oh, can I? Just for a short time. Agreed. I'll be watching you. As soon as I feel that you've had enough, I'll call you back, and no nonsense. Oh, agreed. When can I start? Now. Just walk through that door. I was ready for anything by the time I went to New York. I signed on to do the commissary for "Devil in Miss Jones." So when I went up there to get the money to buy the food, Jerry says, "I got a guy coming into read for the devil in this film. "Would you mind reading opposite him?" "Have you ever had any acting experience?" I said, "Oh, yes." I was an actress. "I'm an actress." And he said, "Would you mind reading with him?" "Of course not." So I sat down, we read the scene. And I'm chewing up the script, you know, I'm having a great time with this. And after the guy leaves, he leans over, he said, "Would you like to play the role?" A lead role in a real movie? Well, I guess so. I said, "Can I cook too?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "I'll pay you 100 a day for acting, and 45 a day to cook." That was a killing for us in those days, let me tell you. So we went toddling out to some place in New Jersey. And so help me, Your Honor, I think it was New Jersey. It could have been New York. I have no idea where it was. It was a big old deserted farm, with a big old barn. And they moved the film equipment into the barn, and we lived in the barn, and we shot in the barn, and we got in the cars and we went home. And that's howl did "The Devil in Miss Jones." I have no idea why "The Devil in Miss Jones," a fuck film, let's face it, a porno, a pornographic film, resonated as it did with such a great range of American society of that time. But for some reason, boy, it just splashed over into something that Judith Crist dubbed "porn chic." If you touch me, I can get off. We'll get off tog ether. If you just... just put your cock in me. Would you like to put your cock in me? Then we can get off. People were going as couples to see hardcore pornographic films, to see sex films. I mean, nice couples. At the time, I had no idea that anyone I knew, much less anyone that I was related to would ever see this film. And, um, they did. And I had to say, "Yeah, that was me." "Yes, brother dear, that was your sister." It was a moment of truth in my life. And I said, "How's Mom taking it?" And he said, "Well, you know Mom. She rolls with any punch that comes her way," and she did, you know. Uh, she never said "I forgive you." But she almost said, "I understand" before she died. I didn't exactly exit the business. The business kind of exited me. Every film I made was the last film I was ever gonna do. I never sought out the films. People would call me and ask me if I would work, if I was busy. And I usually would say, "Well, I don't really want to, but okay, one more." Sol got this very good job, and it was a nine-to-five job and took up my time. Now and then I would get a call to do a film, and I would take a week's vacation and run off and do a film. And one day, my boss called me in and said, "Are you going off to do one of those films?" And I said, "Well, yeah." He said, "It's been brought to my attention" "that some of the board of directors are aware that you have done some of these films." And I said, "This is the last one, I promise." He said, "Oh, okay. I'll tell them that." And it was. I don't know what today's adult films are. I presume it's all on the Web. Or on video tape or cassettes or some media. I doubt if there are what we used to call the "stroke houses" around anymore. You know, when you bought the popcorn box and took the bottom out and dumped the popcorn. Or you brought a top hat. By and large, it's been a delightful trip. I now and then get the feeling, yeah, there's probably a big waterfall somewhere there in the distance. I can kind of hear it rumbling now and then, but what am I gonna do about it? The things I am most grateful for are having met the love of my life- not everybody gets to do that-- and having not only met the love of my life, having him feel the same way about me, so that we could build a life together in this absolutely delightful little paradise that we get to call home, here under the glorious Hollywood sign. In my world- I'm also a psychic reader for a living- so, we don't have time lines because time is infinite in my world. So there's no exit or entrance. It's just all a big giant conglomeration of joy and love. So, no, I don't have an answer to that question. But I plan to dance, perform, dance with snakes and play, until I feel that my heart tells me to do something different. So, it could be infinite, it could be tomorrow, it could be yesterday, it could be five years from now, it could be a month. Oh, see? Darren James. Right now we have a beautiful lady. Back up a little bit and take a look at her. Look at this body. What's your name? - Lara. - Lara. What's your age? Um, 19? 19. I like that. And HIV scare has reportedly shut down the porn industry after Darren James contracted the virus after returning to the US after filming in Brazil. It was discovered that three actresses who had worked with James shortly after his return to the United States had also become infected. A week later, he turned up at a San Diego County hospital recovering from an apparent suicide attempt. He's a middle-aged black porn actor who wanted to be a policeman. This is not going to be a tragedy for me. It's a beginning. You got a reason to be here. You're gonna have to figure that out. I guess I was too old and ugly to die, but I've survived, and I came back. I'm from Detroit. And I started years ago, the United States Navy, 1982. Being a Seabee, it taught me a lot about... team, just being a team. Tours all over the world. And when I was in Puerto Rico, I met some Navy SEALs at the time, 'cause we had a training camp right next to those guys. And those guys just broke me in. I mean, they educated me about myself, my life. It was like a brotherhood. And it taught me something. Far as where I'm at now, it's like... I can't leave my brothers that were in the porn industry behind. That's why I speak about, you know, being with the condoms issue and everything else. And just trying my best to back these guys up. Congratulations, recruit. - Good job. - Thank you, sir. Congratulations, recruit. Thank you. Good job. Mmm. Then, when you get on the outside, it's like, "Wait a minute." "This was reality. I need a job." I fell into the porn industry and it was just one gig after another. Around the time when I was working, I couldn't recall if I got it there. I couldn't even tell you if I got it before I left. We just don't know 'cause I worked so much at that period of time when I was infected. But I remember I wasn't feeling as hot when I got to Brazil at this one particular time I was working. We were doing a huge orgy. It was probably my second orgy when I got there. I was so tired and exhausted. I thought it was just I was overworked. Learning how this virus works, that's probably at the time where I was probably infected and didn't even know. It's hard to conclude and come to a conclusion where I got it. That's the problem. That's the gray area. I just-- You know, if I had a condom, this probably wouldn't have happened. Period. This probably wouldn't have happened. You know, I'm not thinking this stuff would ever happen. The porn industry, this would never--I would never get this. But the way my career ended was my family was in the church. I get diagnosed, same time, it's all over the news in Detroit. So people finding out right there. But for some reason, the church was smart enough-- I haven't seen these people in years-- now keep in mind, I was gone for years. I've been gone from home, and these people protected me even then. They stood up for me even then. I didn't know till I heard later. They stood up by me even then. If it wasn't for the individuals I've met in my past, I still had that memory, like, all these Navy SEALs that I met or military guys that I met that did martial arts. They groomed me. I just brought that back. Brought that back home and just got off my ass. Got off the couch one day. Get back in the gym. 'Cause, you know, I can't help nobody if I ain't helping myself. 'Cause being a public speaker, you gotta be able to back up what you're preaching. You know, they don't want to look at somebody that's all falling apart, typical stigma of being a positive. "Oh, this guy looks sickly." Fuck that. You know, I gotta do it, man. You gotta get out and do something. You know? And keep giving. As much as I can while I still got time on the clock. And I got a lot more work to do. You know? Who knows? Maybe somebody will see me, and just do the same to help somebody else, that's all. - Help, that bar? - Yup. Rich Piano showed me that. Just do the quick shit. A lot of times when you've diagnosed, people, you know, we get in denial. I've been there. You don't wanna do nothing. Ah, just give up. You can't. Just like cancer, any kind of illness that you get, man, you gotta get up and move on. You get better by doing something for yourself, you know? I'll tell anybody else, we all survivors when it comes to this. You know, this is not gonna be a tragedy for me. It's a beginning. I regret that I didn't get out at the time when I was supposed to. 'Cause there was one period I did get out. I quit. I just didn't want to do it. You know, my morals kicked in. And then somebody called me back with a decent budget. And we could probably get you in a contract. I jumped on it. I should have got out. That's what I regret. I didn't make that move. Far as anything else, I miss the travels and the people. Behind the scenes, the crew. You know, I met some really interesting people that opened my eyes. There is good people in the industry. There is a lot of good people. But you can't talk, you know? You go against the grain, you're out. That was their income. Like anybody else, we're all making a living. But being able to stand up against that, the first one in history to stand up against... I think to go so hardcore against the industry, to show that they had some things that were wrong and then address it... I don't regret that. Because you can't save everybody, but I can try. They're not gonna like it, but I'll keep trying. In California, there is a push right now, primarily from one organization, to try and force performers to wear condoms amongst other safety gear, at all times. And the truth of the matter is there are negative effects of condoms. But we're not allowed to talk about them because it's so difficult to get people to use them in the first place. You can imagine that's not a very popular topic. The truth of the matter is when people use condoms, as compared to not using condoms, it's been tested with people within the same partner, that condom use does increase the presence of three different types of bacteria, at least, in the vagina, and also causes erythema, or a reddening in the vulva, which is consistent with more tearing. So if the performers are testing, and they know that they're clean, by using condoms, they're probably increasing their risk of bacterial infection. So they actually have a really good ground to argue against the use of condoms, especially in the context, in the way that they're using them. Because there is some associated increased risk with it. However, you can imagine the knee-jerk to that kind of response. Especially, you know, I work with a lot of HIV researchers. We do not want to have this conversation. Just because it's so difficult to get people who aren't being tested like the performers are to use condoms in the first place. We would hate to discourage their use amongst those type of folks. But I think amongst performers, it's probably very reasonable to let them make that decision. This painting is the quickest painting I've ever done. My boyfriend and I were-- You know how you get in little spats, little fights? We were fighting and I went to bed, and I couldn't sleep. I was furious with him. And I got up, it was three o'clock in the morning, and I came down and I grabbed my biggest canvas that I had, and just let it all out. That's how most of my paintings go. You know, I don't have any training, it's just what I feel. So, this one is called "Mad Love." And it's actually one of my favorites. Grr. Arf. Arf. Give it up. I'm originally from Rockford, Illinois. And there are two things that came out of Rockford that are famous. Cheap Trick, and Ginger Lynn. Porn, it had gone from the place where you sat in a theater in your raincoat and jerked off to you bought a VCR, and you got a Ginger Lynn movie. I was one of the first girls that didn't look like I did What I did. I became so well known so quickly. A lot of mainstream actors knew who I was. They were as excited to meet me as I was to meet them. I was, you know, their first porn. In the '80s when it was cool to be a porn star... - Yeah. ...and celebrities wanted to meet you, I went to lunch with my attorney, and Milton Berle... I'm 21 years old, I'm sitting in this old Hollywood, dark wood, red leather seat restaurant, and I'm in between my attorney and Milton Berle, and Milton Berle unzips his pants and whips his dick out. Just whips it right out in the restaurant right in front of me. And I'm trying to maintain eye contact, but it's very difficult. I kept looking down at it. He never tried anything, didn't try to touch me, didn't play with it, he just whipped it out and let it hang the whole dinner--the whole lunch. Are the stories true? Oh, it's huge! It's huge! He would give John Holmes a run for the money. Big, huge, honkin' dick. I started my adult film career December 9th, 1983. I turned 21 five days later on December 14th. I filmed until February 11th 1986. But the thing I remember about that last day-- It was a couple weeks before I quit, I woke up, and most days I would wake up and go, "Yes! I'm going to have sex with this person today!" "I'm gonna fuck that person, eat this pussy," and I would be so excited. I woke up this one particular morning and I said to myself, "I don't want to fuck today. I'm done." So, I was under contract with Vivid Video at the time. I went into Vivid and said, you know, I talked to the owner and said, "My head's not in the right place and I can't do this." He said, "Cool, I understand." "Is there any way that you could finish" "your last two films under contract?" And I said yes. And February 11th, I came home, and my boyfriend had taken our bathtub and filled it with gallons and gallons and gallons of milk and white rose petals. And I had a cleansing bath that I was done with the business. And there was something really romantic about that. It was like, it really was a cleansing. And not that there's anything bad about what I did, but I was moving on to another phase of my life. When I quit, I didn't think about the big picture. What am I gonna do next? I owned a house in Beverly Hills. I had a mortgage to pay. I guess I would say yes, I did always want to be in the entertainment business without really realizing it. And I am now. Sol broke into the mainstream arena. I worked on dozens of films. I've got a new film coming out called "Lost Souls." - Oh, wow. - Should be out for Halloween. Another film. I have a very small role in the Coen Brothers new film "The Big Lebowski." - What else? - Oh, wow. "Wing Commander: Prophecy" with Mark Hamill will be out for Christmas. And "God's Lonely Man" with Justine Bateman will be out soon. WOW! This is gonna sound awful. I was having really shitty sex. I couldn't find a lover that could satisfy me to save my life for years. I just wanted to get fucked good. I just really wanted- I wanted to have sex with girls. I wanted to get fucked by boys. I wanted to-- I wanted good sex. So I went to Vivid, I went to Wicked, and I went to VCA, and made exorbitant requests. Making a comeback, this is what I want. Get all three of the companies, made me an offer, and I decided to go with VCA. And there's a film I did called "Taken." The director was Veronica Hart. She came to me and she said, "Ginger, you know, I just don't think this is gonna happen. "And I think you're the only actress that can pull this off. "I want to make it into a porn, and I want you to be the star in it." I won best actress for that film that year. And it's the only best actress award I've won that I thought I deserved. I'd become an actress. A lot of people that get into porn, there is no life after porn. They don't know what to do with themselves. And if you're known as a sex object your whole life and sex is all you know, where do you go? How do you apply for a job? You know, I've been fucking on film for the last 30 years? And it's important that you think about your future. You think about what's going to happen afterwards. I've been really lucky with-- you know, I started three Web sites as well as doing my paintings and everything, I have my auction site. Ginger Lynn Auctions dot com, Ginger Lynn dot com, and my art site, which is Ginger Lynn Art dot com. So I've always got a lot of different eggs in the basket and things to fall back on. 'Cause it scares me. You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for. I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005. I wouldn't recommend anybody get into the business today. I just wouldn't. It's changed so much. I had been cast on a film, and there was somebody else doing a scene before me, very famous, very well known actress in the business, good friend of mine. And she was sitting on the sofa, and there was her costar on the other end of the sofa. This is before filming. I used to get in trouble on every single set. Once my makeup was done, I'm on you. I'd be sucking your dick, I'd be kissing you, you know, and then have to redo my makeup. I'd get in trouble all the time because I wanted to be there. These two people sat on opposite ends of the sofa on their phones. And then they called, you know, "We're ready for you on set," and they just went and fucked. There was no connection, no nothing. Sex is such an intimate thing, for me, that I have to like you to fuck you. I have to want to be with you. I want that buildup, that anticipation, that "I can't wait." You know? If you're in an industry that's that intimate, you need to love what you're doing. I always have said if you call me a whore, I'll, like, want to punch you. You can call me a slut all day long. I like to fuck, and I've fucked a lot of people. But I've never been a whore. And if I worked at McDonald's and didn't like it, I'd be a whore. It doesn't necessarily have to do with sex. Doing something you don't want to for money is a whore in my opinion. A lot of the women in the adult film industry completely separate their porn lives from their personal lives. They don't mix, they have different names. And they turn their porn star on and off as needed. What I've chosen to do- I don't know if I chose it or it just happened-- is I brought Ginger-- Ginger Lynn Allen-- to the set. Everything that you see me do on film is me. My energy, my bubbles, my enthusiasm. That's who I am. There is no Ginger Lynn and Ginger Allen. They're the same person. I have porn star Tourette's. I say things I shouldn't say when I shouldn't say them. I own every choice that I've ever made. I'm not ashamed of anything I've done. I have lived an amazing life. I have absolutely no regrets. And I like Ginger Lynn And I like Ginger Allen. Because they're the same person. Um, I got in because I wanted to try something new. 'Cause, you know, I'm just, like, a college student. Going to classes, working. That whole, like, life, trying to barely live. And so I was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna do porn." "I like sex. Why not? Fuck it." So I got into it, and like, I really love it so far. I'm still in school, you know. My major is business, so once I graduate I'm gonna go into real estate. So if I'm still doing porn then, like, yeah, whatever, side job. But like, you know. That's what I'm, like, going in for rig ht now. I'm Johnnie Keyes, man. Who are you? Are we In heaven? Baby, you're in the back seat of a Cadillac Brougham. That's as close to heaven as you're gonna get. The most happiest I am on this planet: hugging my son or granddaughter, singing jazz, and getting all the pussy I can get. That's it. I was raised during the '40s and '50s when this country was a different place, when the Italians used to call me a "jig," which is the guy dancing, right? I was raised in the ghetto, where poor people was, right? You know. Catholic school, all that. But I always wanted to be a singer. ♪ A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four I was always singing on the corner with my boys, you know, doing copies of all the hit music, Little Richard and all those guys. ♪ I'm the only other one you see ♪ Gotta give it a chance to rock her world tonight ♪ Ow-woo! I was a happy teenager except when I was at home, all rig ht. When I turned 16 years old, I packed my shit and I left, to get out of that situation. My dad was alcoholic. He used to beat women and beat me, and I had to get out of that. Hmm. And... And it's like, this motherfucker, my dad, he fucking didn't know what love was. He didn't know about that, you know? And I can't blame him 'cause how he was raised. He was raised during slavery. I can understand that. But I couldn't understand how could he beat his boy? How could he beat his fucking son? And I said, "I gotta go. I gotta get out of here," sol left home. Geez, can I get a napkin? Fuck. You know, every time I talk about that, it fucks me up. I had to leave. I got out. So, I joined the Army, and I became the boxing champion, the lightweight champion of the world. The United States Army sent me to 37 countries. And all I did was kick ass and take names 'cause I had a lot of anger. And so when I would get in the ring with another opponent, he had no chance. When I got into the "Green Door." I got in the "Green Door" like I stumbled over it backwards falling, right? "The Green Door," when I did that movie. Now, when the people came to me with the "Green Door," here's what happened. So we went down there. It was the Mitchell Brothers theatre who produced the "Green Door." I went down there, I did the audition and everything. And then when they came back to me, they said, "Well, listen man, we're making an erotic film." I went, "What do you mean, erotic?" "A fuck movie." I go, "Oh, yeah. Okay, cool." Jim Mitchell, Art Mitchell, they're upstairs, over at the O'Farrell Theatre. They go, "Johnnie", "you're gonna be the man behind the door, and you're gonna have a sex scene with Marilyn Chambers." So, I go, "Okay. All right." So, they bring me out at the end. She's 20 years old, looking like a little fresh white flower, right? I'm going, "Yeah, right." Now, come the day of the shoot, rig ht, and the Mitchell Brothers had a whole other thing set up. I said, "Hold it, man." Being a thespian myself, I go, "Hold it. "Here's what I'm gonna do. Here's how I'm gonna do the shot. "I'm gonna have my African necklace on, rig ht, "and when I walk from behind the green door, "there's women there and they're trying to touch me, but I'm not gonna let them touch me 'cause I'm focused." And Marilyn Chambers is lying out there like this. My eye is focused on that muffin, right? You know what I'm saying? So, I'm looking at that. And now, when we start doing the sex scene, I eat her pussy, and then I start fucking her, right? But being an athlete, I fucked Marilyn for 43 minutes without stopping, and the last time she came, she fainted. And I'm looking down at this woman, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and I went, "What the hell?" "I done killed a white woman, I'm going to jail. I killed a white woman with my dick! What the fuck?" This is what's going on in my brain as I'm looking down at her, and she's like... "Eh," right? So, they said, "Okay, Johnnie." "Get back up off the pussy and walk back through the green door." They pick Marilyn up and bring her over on the side and put smelling salts in her nose and shit to bring her around. I bend down, I go, "Marilyn, are you all right?" And she looked at me, she goes, "Oh, Johnnie, oh..." She says, "Oh, Johnnie."I go... I go, "What happened?" She says, "I don't know." She says, "I came and then I went somewhere." And I go, "Jesus Christ!" So now, I'm back on Broadway doing "Jesus Christ Superstar." I get a call. "Hey, Johnnie, what's up? "How you doing? Yeah." from the Mitchell Brothers. They say, "You know you're the star of this movie." I go, "What you talking about, man?" I said, "I'm in theater, I'm doing legitimate theater." I'm not no porno star." They go, "Yes, you are." I go, "What are you talking about?" They go, "We got a $50,000 check waiting for you", "and you gotta go to Cannes Film Festival because they're dying to meet you." And I went, "How much? 50,000? Okay." So that made the myth of the black dude with the big dick in white society, it made it real. It made it real for society, and they went, "What?" I get off the plane, man, and women are throwing their panties and their keys, and everything. "Oh, Johnnie!" Our pavilion was going 24 hours. Everybody was staying open like, eight hours. "The Green Door" was going 2417. Sol get the award for the best erotic film ever shot and all that stuff. And I come back home to the United States, and I figure that's it, right? I figure, "Okay, I'm finished with that." But then all this stuff happened. They want me to come to New York, they want me to come to Detroit to do all these openings for "the Green Door" where I'm sitting and signing autographs. That whole deal, rig ht? That was cool. Then after that me and Marilyn did two more movies together. "Inside Marilyn Chambers," and her "Resurrection of Eve." Later on, when I used to go to the erotic film awards, all the brothers would see me, they'd go like this. 'Cause if it weren't for me, they wouldn't be there. I opened the door for them. Which was cool. At the time I didn't know what I was doing. I was just doing what I was doing. I was doing this shot for the Mitchell Brothers in a theater down on Market Street, Market Street in San Francisco. I was doing a reenactment of "the Green Door" for a live audience. Meanwhile, they got seven cops in the audience. And when I pull out my dick and go to do it, they all, cops just came in and busted me. Took me to jail. Of course the Mitchells got me out insto-presto. But then I went before the court. So we had to moved it up to the California Supreme Court. Fornication in a public place, that was the charge. And I said, "Man, I'm not sticking my dick in these women." I'm moving it to the side. It's a play-act thing." 'Course, you know, those cops, those motherfuckers. So, I go before the Supreme Court. So, they call me up and they go, "Okay, Johnnie, what you got to say?" All these old men with their gray hair and their soft dicks. So, I go, "Would you rather for your children" "to see people cut each other up, blow each other up, "kill each other, "or would you rather for your children to see "people hugging and kissing and making love? Which would you rather for your children to see?" Of course, they can't say. They gotta say the latter, the hugging and the kissing. And my testimony helped change the sexual mores of this country. It made it legal for human beings to go to a store and rent an X-rated movie legally. And I helped make that thing a reality in this country. So, I freed a lot of dicks and pussies. That's howl feel about it. Know what I mean? Real talk. That's real talk. Years ago, I did a play on Broadway called "The Wiz," and that's the black production of "The Wizard of Oz" if you people don't know. One night, the lead singer in the show had laryngitis. And the producers came, "Johnnie, can you sing 'Over the Rainbow'?" "Because she can't sing it." And I had never did "Over the Rainbow“" 'cause that wasn't my part of the show. 'Cause I was the Tin Man, rig ht? So, I go, "Okay, yeah, I'll try it." And so this is the way I did it. ♪ Somewhere over the rainbow So, then after that I had a son. And you know what happens to men when they have boys. Right? This woman ran off with my boy. See, I had taught school. Like, I said, Robin Williams was one of my students and people. She says, "You got a PhD. "Go teach school. You don't need to be making these fuck movies." I said, "Let me tell you, when I met you I was making fuck movies. "That's the reason why you came to me," "'cause you wanted that big dick, bitch." "So don't be telling me about, you know," "you want to change my life?" "You gonna come into my life now and try to change me?" I said, "You don't have that power, woman." So, the first thing she did was snatch my son and take him away from me, which broke my heart. And that's when I went and came up to Washington to raise my boy. And I raised my boy, he became a Globetrotter. He became one of the top athletes in Washington. So, I'm proud of that. I talked to him last night, right? He said, "Listen", "all the motherfuckers gotta go to the Wikipedia and they see you." "And they know I'm your son." He said, "So you don't have to do it no more, Pops." He said, "Pops, you don't have to do that no more." He said, "'Cause you are what you are", "and I am what I am, "and no matter whatever comes out in the wash, we're beautiful." That's my boy telling me. ♪ Where trouble melts like lemon drops I'm not saying I want to exit porn. I love porn for what it is and how it can develop. And I'm really into, like, pushing the boundaries of future porn, of, like, I don't know, technologies and stuff. I'm really into, like, virtual reality porn and stuff like that at the moment. So, yeah, I'm happy with what I'm doing, but eventually I want to direct and produce films. And basically push the boundaries of what's out there at the moment technology-wise. You know? I'm doing a bit with 360 video work at the moment, just testing and stuff. And hopefully, I think, that's got a lot of prospect. But, yeah, porn's one of them worlds, man. It's ever-evolving and, you know, all the new technologies are always found, and some come and some go. And I'm just grateful to be where I am and kind of progressing with it, you know what I mean? So, hopefully one day, I'll be able to direct and produce films and find another big dick kid like me and change his life, man. That's all I want to do. What's the difference between a boy toy, a slave, and a fuck buddy and a boyfriend? I've actually had to try to explain this to my shrinks before. Slave boys, they enjoy the fetter side of things. Fuck buddies are people that would be boyfriends if they were better. And then boyfriends are people that you have, you know, spiritual, sexual, emotional relationships with, and, you know, you're intimate and vulnerable, and all of that kind of fun stuff. And the boy toys are just supposed to shut the fuck up, be cute and pretty and do as mistress mommy tells them to. I always wanted a smooth-running machine of a business, like that was always my goal. I remember, like, asking people, like, "How do you get into porn? How do you get into porn?" And then I ended up doing a photo shoot with High Society and Cherry Magazine in Jamaica. And who was my roommate? Jenna Jameson was. So, she's like, "You need to move to LA and live with me, and I'll hook you up." And, you know, I was taking care of my mother at that time. And I told my mom that we were gonna be moving to Hollywood, Florida. So I'm in Jamaica and I call my mom up, and I'm like, "Mom, we're moving to Hollywood!" And she's like, "Yeah, I know." I'm like, "Scratch." "Hollywood, California." She's like, "What?" I was 23 and I decided to open up, you know, a 5,000 square-foot studio, make it a rental facility. And I started right after that my first Web site and then, you know, decided to do a whole network of them and all different kinds of fetishes. It was called "The Niche Bitch." I had the Niche Bitch network. And it went from there. Then the whole gonzo thing kind of started when you started having, like, digital cameras. And everybody else used to call it, um, the actual civilian term for it... -- "civilian" meaning you people- ...um, non porn stars, uh, it was called Pro-Am. Which really all it meant was there was a bunch of idiots that used to be porn stars that had picked up a camera, myself included... ...but mostly it was all guys. Because, once again, it was a very, very boys' school business back then. I mean, it was all Italian mafia that did distribution, and it was all Jewish mafia that did production, and women were not allowed to kind of get in there, especially distribution, you know. So, but anyways, there was a film, I think it was called "Erocity," where I was raping the fuck out of this guy's ass in my dungeon, and it was really hilarious because I broke my discipline horse. And I just kept pounding that motherfucker into the ground. And it was so funny 'cause the director afterwards was like, "You didn't miss a beat." And I'd always have, you know, these soirée affairs, and I'd have a curator with all these fetish kind of art, and I'd have these custom-made outfits, and I'd have an open bar. And then, you know, I'd be double-fisting somebody in the dungeon downstairs. And, you know, my mom would be upstairs, and she's like, "I'm so proud of my daughter." And they're like, "Do you know what she's doing downstairs?" "I don't care. I'm just very proud of her." I know I'm hypocritical 'cause I'm a dominatrix and I beat the shit out of men, but I just feel like it's appropriate doing it to a man but not a woman. Call me cray-cray, it's the feminist in me. - Sam? - Yeah? How about you come over here and sit besides me on this couch and show me some of that Sam Slate private dick? Thought you'd never ask me. I feel like now when I watch porn, it's like, you know, fucking her in the ass, and choking her and, you know, having as many cocks as you possibly can, and it's all this spit and put her head in the toilet. And I am not down with that program. So when I had originally retired, because all porn stars, we come back and we... That's what we do, we leave and we come back. But when I originally retired, I had no problem doing it because the business that I knew where you actually had sex, like, on beds and desks, and, you know, and it was like, you were having sex. It was, like, good. Now, oh my God, I need to do a sitz bath afterwards. I mean, they freaking kill you. It's like, it's all about pounding you into the next room, and choking you. They don't do that shit to me. Because I will turn around and clock the motherfucker. 'Cause I am a dominant woman and I'm older. Respect your elders, beyotch. I had been retired for quite a few years and a director contacted me, not knowing that I had been retired. And he's like, "Oh, you know, I was wondering, you know, "I had a scene that I wanted you to be in. And I was like, "Okay, well, what's the name of the film?" And he's like, "Golden Girls." I'm like, "You're a fucking jerkoff!" Dude calls me back, like, a year later and he goes, "I got your comeback film." I'm like, "Get the fuck outta here. Didn't think I'd be hearing from you again," and... Do you want a piece of me, you little bitch? What? "Sex and the City," I want you to play Samantha. I'm like, "Dude, I like you, man." So, I got to do that particular movie, and I had realized it had been a while since I'd been on camera. I had maybe done, like, two anal scenes in my entire life. So I said I would do an anal scene. But I'm not a pro at this. God bless all of the men out there that think that, you know, there's not a lot of preparation that goes into this. Let me tell you something, there... there needs to be. Oh, you dirty, naughty boy. - You wanna fuck my ass? - Yeah, I wanna fuck that ass. Oh, yeah. Shove that big cock in my ass. It's like, 10:00 a.m. and you're having, like, a 20-inch cock shoved into your ass, right? And, you know, I haven't had anything in my own booty for, like, a long time. I'm in the bathroom talking to a girlfriend of mine. "Allison, something happened to my ass." She's like, "What are you talking about?" I'm like, "There's something wrong with my ass." She's like, "What are you talking about?" I'm like, "No, there's really something, like, "like, I think my ass flipped inside out or- Yeah." And she's like, "What are you talking--" I'm like... (whining) "Something's wrong with my ass." And so, sure enough, I go back on set, you know, and I'm like, got my legs together and I'm scooting in, and they're like, "Uh, are you okay?" And I'm like, "Um... Something happened to my ass." And they're like, "Oh, not a big deal. You're just rosebudding it." I'm like, "What is rosebudding it?" And they're like, "Well, it's when you have a prolapse, "you know, like, your ass, like, prolapsed. "It flips inside out." Right? And I'm like, "Oh, no, this is not good." They're like, "Oh, don't worry about it. "There's like a ton of girls in the industry "that have permanent rosebud. "There's like a whole prolapse fetish genre of film." And I'm like, "No..." The next time I did an anal scene, I prepared for a month. Have you put any restrictions on what you're willing to do on video? Um, at this point in time I have. I won't do any anals or gangbangs, and that's pretty much it. And the only reason is, is... ...it's more, like, a business thing than anything else. I figure I have to have something left when... to market a little bit later on. So, you'll probably see me doing it a little bit later, but not quite yet. Gonna make you wait for it. Do you do it off camera? Oh, definitely. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Definitely. Well, I don't know about gangbangs. I don't really usually get into a gang bang situation all that often. Um, but anal sex, I do try get it in every once in a blue moon. I'd been producing and directing for 15 years, and I thought, "Well, you know what? "Why don’t l understand the theory "of what I've actually been doing for the last 15 years." Sol moved to New York and I started going to the New York Film Academy. I did two years of producing, one year of directing. It was funny 'cause they would go on my IMDB page and, you know, there's these 19-year-old film school boys, and they're like, "Oh my God! You have 1,000 credits?" "Your IMDB page is so big and massive and huge. "Wow!" You know. So yeah, when I realized that independent filmmaking was not going to continue making me the rich bitch that I'm used to being... Maybe l should DJ? Workaholic slash rave chick girl. Work my ass off, work hard, play hard kind of thing. I was always billed out as the porn star DJ. But then I've also been in "Playboy" magazine, so also "Playboy" DJ. And, you know, now l get to just be a talented scam artist DJ. I've not had any issue with my past being negative. It's actually been the exact opposite. I've utilized all the tools and connections and things like that in whatever new businesses that I start now. I am very happy that I was a part of the "golden age of porn." Very happy. 'Cause, you know what? I don't know if I could do it nowadays. I really don't know if I could. Most men involved in the industry, outside of most of the talent, I don't think they're pro-women. I don't think they like women. I think that they get off on having power over women. But it also creates money, so, you know, that's my opinion. I don't think it's... It's far from the most honorable industry that ever existed. Long-term, I'm actually doing my Web site now. Eventually, I want to keep doing it, but, I mean, if something else comes up, that'd be cool too, but... I want to eventually, like, hire people to do it for me, so, like, I don't have to do it anymore, you know what I mean? Like, have my own site and pay girls to do stuff. Or men. So that I don't have to, like-- I can be, like, a director basically, you know? That'd be cool. Back up this way now. Yeah, nice. Can you bring 'em underneath yourself? Yeah? Let's pop those out. Beautiful. Okay, good. That's it. Drop that shoulder. Yeah, nice. Bring your left shoulder to me just a little bit. Rig ht there. Yeah, very strong. Beautiful. Rig ht there, good. Do you like this job so far? I love this job so far. Are there certain aspects of this kind of work that you dislike? Yeah, but the likes outweigh the dislikes. What's going on in the life of Chasey Lain? Right now l'm out here working. I do two weeks on, two weeks off. And I'm giving some love to Dennis here at the BunnyRanch. There it is. And a lot of love to a lot of fans out there? Yeah. Anybody can come, swing on by and we'll have a good time. There you go. So, are you-- Are you still doing movies or are you done with that? Mmm, I don't know if I'm done with it. I'm not shooting right now. OK Off and on, I went to the BunnyRanch for a minute and worked. I don't have any problem with Dennis. It's just that it's not for me, 'cause it's really way far out of town, and I don't like the money split there. They take half of everything and then charge you for room and board and different stuff as well. And it gets real slow during Christmas 'cause it gets real cold there and it snows and stuff. So sometimes there would be days, two, three, four days and not one person would walk in the door. So you end up having to stay a little bit longer than you would have 'cause you're upside down to the house. 'Cause every day that you're there, they charge you room and board and this and that. The adult business and the escort business are two separate businesses. They want nothing to do with each other. In fact, years back, if you were escorting, you were blackballed in the adult industry. They would never hire you again on set if they found out you were escorting. You're supposed to be untouchable when you're doing film. And so that means not everybody can get to you to shoot you or. Not everybody could get to you to have sex with you. Otherwise, why would you buy the video? The video has to be the only place they can get it or it won't sell. My free time, I like to spend shopping. With my son. Or, um... Relaxing. I like my horses and, you know. Are you a clothes girl? Or are you a shoes girl? I'm shoes. I'm shoes. - You have a big collection? - I'm a shoes girl. I do. Huge. 800 or so pair. Any particular brand in particular? Not in particular. It's every brand. Every pair. My contracts progressively got better throughout the years. Dancing progressively got better too. I got a base pay and then I got two rooms and two tickets. 'Cause I didn't share a room with my roadie. And I don't take a split on merchandise either. Some of the clubs want to take, like, half your money. Yeah, I had my own toy line, and I had my own line of realistics, vibrators, and love gels, so. They molded my hands, my face, my crotch, my feet... my whole body, I guess. There were 25 products out on the market. I would get checks every two, three months for like, 60,000 and stuff like that. I'm old school. You absolutely know that gonzo's not my favorite. It's something with a script and a plot. But see, most people would be surprised that'd you want to have a script and... It's so much easier to go by a script, and you're going to work to pretend to do something, to be something, to do. I mean, it's an entire act, so why not? I mean, yeah, of course I'd like to have a script, something to actually do, work on. Not just... plop up camera there. That takes all the mad movie magic out of it. Yeah, the Internet wasn't around when I first got into the business, and then it destroyed the business pretty much. People can just look at the Internet and get whatever they want for free. There's no need to put any kind of production value into anything. There's no need to pay an extra penny for anything when it's being shoved down your throat for free. The same opportunities are not available now that were then. I produced an all-girls line for Vivid called "Chasin' Pink" and my budgets were $30,000. I mean, that was considered gonzo. My "gonzo," my $30,000 "gonzo." I mean, have you seen the stuff that's up there? I mean, I uh... Last time I checked, Bang Brothers didn't have a whole elaborate setup. It's different now. I mean, they shoot something in their living room and throw it on the Internet and then now they're a porn star. Well, it's not really paying your dues. But okay. What would you like to do after adult films? Is there life after adult films? I don't know. I don't think so, but... Right. Um, next question. How would you judge the future of porn in general? I think the future of porn... Well, my Lord, it's the oldest profession that there is, sol pretty much think it's just gonna get better. Yeah, it would take money to do another scene. I mean, the companies now just aren't really paying. If I wanted to shoot every day, I could. I'm just not interested in shooting every day because I don't really like to do interracial scenes too much. I don't want to shoot anal. And so, that's mostly what they're shooting and I'm just not interested in shooting that. And so, I don't. I mean, I've done adult for a long, long time. I mean, there's other things that can be done that I'm also interested in that I would like to do since the adult business doesn't exist anymore. Since... Let it go to bed. - It's for you. - Oh! - Hello? - Allison? Fame is real. Fame is fun. I made it so I'd get recognized when I go to the grocery store. Everybody's your best friend when... ...when you're a star. A person who is paid for sex doesn't necessarily have any negative repercussions from that act. And some of the things people have investigated, for example, are things like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders. And while they may occur more frequently in that population, there's no evidence that their receiving sex for money caused that problem for them. Let's say I'm some unemployed guy or something in the middle of the country living in a trailer park, but I have the ware-for-all to be able to save $100 a week up so that on my birthday next year, I can buy my favorite hooker or porn star for an hour. Okay, she just fell off that pedestal, in my opinion. And she became less valuable to the industry. As soon as someone can have you for a price outside the industry, your value to the industry goes down. However, the models use our industry and our sites and the scenes as advertising that they're still an active adult film star. People think that once you do a porn, it's like over with, but it's really not. Once you do porn, it actually opens up a door to... I walk around, and I'm walking in the like street the other day, and I was just crossing the like, road. I'm crossing the road and a guy yells out by car, "I fucking hate you, Donny Sins. You son of a bitch." I'm like, "Who are you?" He's like, "I watched you on Dogfart the other day." "You were fucking this blonde chick that I love and I never got to fuck her before." And you're like... It opens up avenues for you, you know what I mean? And then it's funny enough that he cursed me out and then offered me a fucking ride down the street. And I'm like, "No, I'm fine." It's a nice day. I would rather walk Okay, red light's on. We're recording. All right. I have no idea if this is even working. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I just want to make a tape, okay? So, here's me. Hope you like it. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the feature presentation. Shit. This thing on? How the hell am I gonna shut it off? And Tabitha, what about you? You're in porno. What age did you start doing porno? I started at 25. I'm 31. - You're 31 years old--- - 25 is a late start! You're a late starter, yeah. The way she started... I said, "How did you start?" She said she was a bored housewife. - Yes. - Really? - You were a married woman. - Yes, I was. And you were sitting at home. Did you watch a lot of porno at home? No, I've only seen-- I only saw half a porno my whole life. I'd have to say that Howard Stern has been a very big part of my career. He helped me brand Tabitha Stevens. And it's a great opportunity. And I have to laugh because I always hear, "Did you have to sleep with Howard to be on that many times on his show?" And no, never. I've never, ever had sex with Howard Stern. I've never, ever, ever had sex with Howard Stern. Or anyone from his show, unless it was a Wack Pack member, okay? There you have it. The truth coming from my mouth to your ears. I like, when I'm going on a set, I like to know what I'm going to do. I like to know this on the porno set. - Mm-hmm. - I like to know what time I'm going to be finished and I like to be treated with respect. That's all there is. I mean, that's the one thing. If you treat me with respect, I'll treat you with 100 times more respect. That's all it is. It's just that. In 1993, I got married. And I married a guy who was a super-cool guy. Did very well for himself. I was a stripper when I first met him, and then I quit obviously. And I became a housewife. And I was very bored. The first video that I shot was called "Rolling Thunder." It was by Vivid Entertainment. Racquel Darrian was on the box cover and my scene was with Bobby Vitale. And it was supposed to be a girl, but it ended up being a boy/girl. They switched it on my last minute. So, of course I didn't tell my husband at the time that. But I remember- this is the funniest thing-- being nervous about my dialog. The sex I knew l could do, 'cause I knew I had a... You know, I was real good at that. I kinda still am. But anyway. But my thing was, what if I don't get my lines right? And I told them that. And they're like, "You're gonna be fine." After my scene was over, well, I was on a desk. I was supposed to be playing a secretary. - Imagine that. - With Bobby Vitale. And when I got up, there were phone numbers imprinted on my ass. And I couldn't figure out what it was. Like, "Oh, my God, who did this?" But, yeah, so it was kind of interesting. But then I got divorced right after that. I had my mom get all my stuff out of my house, you know, got divorced, and that was it. Never looked back. I just couldn't see myself being an extension of somebody else's life. I mean, he was successful in what he did and he was a great provider, and again, I have nothing against the guy whatsoever. But here's the thing. It's like that was his thing. I needed to find my thing and it ended up porn was my thing. I just call it ass-fucking, myself. When I got into the business, I was told one really important thing. Pace out your career. If you want any kind of longevity, don't do anal scenes right away. Give it a couple of years. Don't do a double penetration right away. Wait for interracial. That was a big thing. Okay, well, I didn't know. Here I come into a business. I didn't know anybody in the porn business. So, I paced my career. It took me what, about a year and a half, two years to do my first anal scene? Think I've done eight anal scenes my entire career. Maybe eight to ten? Double penetration. I did that... three years later? So, I took my time with it. It took me 17 years before I did my first interracial scene. So, I took my time so that I wasn't burnt out and people weren't burnt out. Are you following me again? Told you to stop following me. No, no, wait. I think nowadays that the day of the contract is over. And that was a big deal for us. That was a totally big deal because you use that contract to get on box covers. You needed those box covers so you could go on the road dancing. You made a lot of money feature dancing. Now, I do know that nowadays girls still go on the road. What happened to being in those bigger movies where you could be the only girl on the box cover? Now everybody's on the box cover with gaping assholes. I don't think that's attractive. Back then it was classier than I think it is now. And I think that girls are doing things nowadays that they probably wouldn't really want to do, like the double anals or the double vag. Because they want to make the money and because there's so much competition. But the art of it is when you're suckin' it, you gotta twist it. You gotta twist it at the top. Remember that, Dave, for later. Twist, jerk it, and twist it and lick it and go down and up. But don't do it in my teeth. I mean, they hurt. These are really good teeth. See? They're really good. We're all in the sex business. And I've heard this said before. We're all hoes on this bus when it com es to work. I've heard that now girls are getting into the porn business so that they can become escorts. That's what's happening now. I'm not against it. Not one bit. So, that's why you really don't see the age of the porn star anymore. I think that there are a very few. You still have your Jessica Drakes of the world. But you look at Jessie today, and I mean, who else after Jessie? I don't really know many girls that are now the porn star. And now l think that's the way they're doing it, is to... And I'm not knocking the girls. Hey, if that's how they want to make their money, that's fine. Again, be safe about it. But I think they're coming in the industry to make a little name, and then they go out there and make probably even more money being an escort. So have you ever wondered why I'm so at ease with the adult business and when you were doing movies and whatnot? I kind of have an idea, but what is it? Well, it's that... I understand the entertainment value. I understand that there's rarely true passion involved. And that at the end of the day, it's a job as most jobs are. Rolling. Cut. All right. I'm gonna get a wide shot and I'll come back there. And rolling. And the reality of it is, is it's hard work. It's entertainment. I knew that you, like anybody in the adult business has to produce work. When I decided to hang it up, with my career, I'd have to say it was pretty much a joint decision about that. - Wouldn't we say? - Absolutely. Yeah, it was. Again, I respect Gary so much. And if Gary ever had a hard time and said, you know, "I really don't want you to do this anymore." Could you please stop?" I would. I just love and respect my husband. And he's the same with me. And I just figured, you know, and it was time. It was just time to move on to bigger and better things. Tabitha and I spend day after day after day backpacks on our backs, trekking into the wilderness, and we're shooting amazing, stunning, beautiful fine art photography landscapes. And we're producing and Tabitha's core, absolutely pivotal. A lot of the ideas are hers, the concepts are hers, the design. And we're producing and creating these works for a fine art photography gallery, - which is named... - Savage Territory, a Gary Orona gallery. How do I say it again? - "This is where I am." - "This is where I am." Okay. This is where I am now. My husband and I own a fine art photography gallery here, in Green River, Utah, called Savage Territory. - Yeah. - Okay. But I'm just letting you know I'm more fine. I'm really fine. I actually do think about a life after porn. I want to either... I want to go to college really. I was raised Jehovah Witness, so I was in a really small school that my family opened. So, I've not really been familiar with like, public schools or public schooling. So, college to me is gonna be a huge experience. So, what I'd like to do is go and kind of see the colleges and see the different like paths that I can take 'cause I don't even know really what I want to do after porn. But I don't want to do porn for the rest of my life. I'll probably be in maybe another year or two is the longest I would say, and then go to a school and figure out kind of what I want to do. And maybe I'll work with children or maybe something like massage therapy or physical therapy maybe. I do have a plan for getting out of porn and performing. I'm actually a partner in the agency that I'm with right now. And we have a production side. It's called Vuluce. And we'll be shooting models for that and doing fan sites and all that good, fun stuff. I want to have a family one day. So, definitely on the right track to succeeding for that. So, I'm excited. I got this fantasy job that, you know, I gotta step back and kind of analyze this here and say, "Wait a minute." "You know, I can choose any woman, you know, or l could ask if I can have a scene with her." And to know that I'm gonna be with most amazing women is just kind of... fantasy come true. A lot of people have hang up about me just doing girl/girls, and oh, it's this, it's fake and it's shit. They can kiss my ass 'cause it's not. I don't like, you know, when a lot of the girl/girls have the, you know, touch tongues or this. I want a connection where we can hold tight and sweat and... two become as one. Life is gonna zoom on by and... you know, I want to grab and feel things as much as I can now. And I feel here just recently, I want to grab all this stuff. And I'm almost in a panic. It's been years since I've been interviewed or in front of a camera. Ultimately, this whole industry is a big, fucking cop out on life. You wake up, you're 47 years old, and you ain't got a pot to piss in. Great. 25 years. Now what are you gonna do? Okay, I... It's... Now what? I remember being in my childhood house and I'm thumbing through a local PennySaver, and I saw an ad that said "Wanted: figure models." It was a test shoot for Penthouse. You know, I'm wearing my grandmother's silk robe, and I put on some Lee press-on fingernails, and we did some makeup and went to Malibu Beach. Test shot and lo and behold, it was the centerfold for December '87. I was pampered. I was loved. I was wanted. From there is where I met Andrew Blake. And he asked me if I'd be interested in triple-X. At the time I was married and I said, "Yeah, I could venture into triple-X" as long as it's women only." You know, out of courtesy for my husband at the time. And lo and behold, "Hidden Obsessions." Julia Ann and myself were at that same time dancing as Blondage. We were on the road and, you know, I told her about what has just happened with, you know, being asked to do "Hidden Obsessions." And she came aboard and then she and I did the ice, the infamous ice dildo scene, and that won awards, and... we were rockstars. ♪ Come on over ♪ oh, honey, ooh, ooh ♪ Said, "Come on over" The bucks were flying in. I was just buying cars for my mom, for my sister, for this person, that person, and big houses, and a lot of stuff. I didn't know what to do with it all. It happened so fast. I wasn't prepared for it, which led me into taxes. I--And-- Porn star Janine Lindemulder is facing federal criminal rap for failing to pay about $80,000 in income tax. Lindemulder was named last month in a misdemeanor accusing her of stiffing the IRS for taxes due on more than $350,000 of income in 2004. Went to prison, misdemeanor, failure to-- or willful failure to pay back taxes. That was kind of-- that was the beginning of... an incredible... life-altering nightmare. Janine Lindemulder is now locked in a bitter custody dispute with Sandra Bullock and her husband Jesse James. Janine Lindemulder says she's a good mother and her daughter is her world. But Bullock and her husband Jesse James have accused her of everything from drug use to child neglect and are seeking sole custody. Now that Lindemulder has finished a six-month prison term for tax evasion, she wants her child back, setting the power couple up for a big fight. When the whole Sunny custody thing is happening... my ex had his lawyer, high-priced lawyer. I'm there, no lawyer... totally confused about the situation. I'm tatted. Judge is looking at what my line of work is. At one point, she put her papers down, looked me square in the eyes and said, you know, "What happened to you in your childhood" to make you the way you are?" And, you know, she sized me up. She saw the tattoos, she sees that you're a porn star, and it was pretty much a done deal. She... without even giving me an opportunity to state my case, I lost her. Being in the industry, being heavily tattooed definitely changed the course of my life. You know. The longer I was away from my daughter, the darker my world became. I then found myself heavily medicated. You know, doctors prescribed anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and then pain pills came into play. Vicodin, absolutely drug of choice. Poppin' those things like candy. And just anything to alleviate some of the anguish that I felt. I found myself... and this is tough to say, but, homeless. Homeless in my van with my cat, just trying to make sense of what's happened. Having my daughter pulled out of my life in such a... harsh manner. You know, there was no phone calls. There was--I couldn't tell her l love her. You know, "I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening." I'm trying to get to you." Everything was so confused and I felt like I was at a point of... I want to check out. I want to check out. I can't deal. I don't have the tools. When Janine was going through what she went through with Jesse and the loss of Sunny, I thought I was gonna lose her. I thought I was gonna lose her. And because she suffered, she suffered so, so deeply. You know, I couldn't get the knife out. I couldn't make it right. Everything I tried, it was not enough. To replace Sunny... was all I wanted to do, was get her back and get her in her arms again, and we just didn't have the power. We didn't have what, you know, he had as far as power and money, and, you know. He's an unworthy father and... I finally have the nerve to call a suicide hotline. Call 'em up, I said, "Man, I don't know what's happening here. I need to talk to somebody." And funny but sad, the woman picks up the phone and she says, "We're really sorry, but the doctor's not in." And I'm like, "Are you fucking kidding me? Okay. All right, I'll call back." So, I'm kind of laughing, crying at this point and right then and there, I said, "Okay." Enough is enough. I've got to pull this together." I went to rehab. I was in rehab for a month. And everybody at this point thought I was just out of my mind. "Oh, she's a meth head. Oh, she's on crack." No, no, I'm lost. I'm fucking heartbroken beyond words. At the same time, I'm subjecting myself to looking on the Internet and looking at people comparing me to America's sweetheart, Sandra Bullock, saying, "Well, Janine deserves to lose her kid. She's this cracked out, you know, porn whore." And, you know, "Sandra Bullock is, you know, the best thing for Sunny." And it- that's just bringing me down. And I'm going, "How am I gonna do this?" Do I want my daughter to do what I've done? Fuck no. No way. I'm still- I'm in limbo. I don't know what the future holds. Do I go back to school? Am I gonna be a waitress? I don't know. It's really kind of a... an odd time of my life right now. I'm trying to figure that out and, you know, make my next move. I've gotta have the backbone to do it. You know. So far... I don't. I don't have it. But it's getting there, you know. It's a work in progress.
