THE HUNTER You can't throw that six. Can't you see it's a trump? You'll lose again. Hello. - It's been a while. - Are you free tonight? - My door is always open. - For everybody? - For a guest who is a good man. - I'm not just a guest. Hey! Tramp! People are looking. Come in the evening. Hold him! They found you in the mountains in winter. That tramp isn't your mum. She just took care of you! Are you going to cry or not? He won't cry. He's too cold. Let's leave him! MONDAY Greetings. How are you? Fine. I see you're not empty-handed. A male. From the Turtle Mountains. It's a very nice wolf. Beautiful. It's too bad there are fewer of them now. What's new in the mountains? I saw the lone wolf's tracks yesterday by the riverbank. There was one strange thing. The print on the ground... had five toes. It's not a wolf from our mountains. The herders say he's from the Altai Mountains. You came from there too. You're chilled through. I'll warm your breath up. Hello, son. You won't greet me? Erken, did you greet your uncle? Say hello to your uncle. Why don't you greet our guest? He's your guest. You toad! I'm fed up with you! Act your age. Please say hello. I'm at my wit's end. He's naughty. He's cold, unfeeling. Hey, Sujindyk! Go and start the car. Wait a moment... Do you have enough petrol today? Did you fill up the tank? Taking a break? None of your business. - Where is your son? - He's sleeping in his room. Let's have a look. So where is he? And your horse? In the backyard. And your rifle? Attention, children. Go straight ahead and keep your eyes open so that nothing escapes you. Hello. Good idea. I knew where you'd hide. You oaf! You wrecked the shop. You frightened everyone. Why did you do it? I talked to your mother. This is what we decided... You'll either head for the hills with me, or go to prison. - Greetings! - Hi! How are you? Look. Those are the Turtle Mountains. They're always covered in snow. Remember this place. You'll come back here. You'll hunt by the riverbank. Greetings. Greetings to you too. It's nice to have guests. - Get off your horse. - Thank you. Everything's the same? Thank God. - Come inside. - Come on. Go in, son. Why did the herders come back from the mountains so soon? There's a lone wolf on the prowl. He won't leave us alone. Did you see him with your own eyes? No, thank God. Just his footprints. Like these? Five toes? That's right. He gets too close to people. Who is that boy? He'll be a hunter like me. God's willing. Look, a wolf! What are you sitting here for? Stop him! All right, little hunter... Find your way to us again soon. This is our first son. Give him your blessing. Grow strong and flourish. God be with you. There are people in these hills. And the hills over there are empty. Who told you that? The mountains are never empty. Look. Listen. That's a wolf. Do you hear it? The females respond. Now I'll howl like a she-wolf. Do you hear it? You're like a wolf. I'm not a wolf. I'm an eagle. You're a wolf. Now you do it. Hey, get up and do it right. Bend your head back. Louder! Hey! Come here. Are you herding sheep in the mountains? Is he your father? Why is he silent? Is he mute? He doesn't talk to women. So who are you? Hunters. - Is she looking at us? - Yes. - What is she doing? - She's loosened her hair. WEDNESDAY Give it to me. Hold your breath when you shoot. Look. That woman we saw before is coming here. Bring the horse. Her hair is down. Hurry. Give it to me. Look. This is for two. It has to be tight, or she'll fall off the horse. Is it dead? It's stopped buzzing. Give it to me. It might be dead. It'll come back to life. It's buzzing again. It flew away. You don't have warmth inside. That's why you don't feel all the beauty of the world. Hand me the knife. Come on. Here. Stand there. I've raised this horse since it was born. - Do you hear? - Yes. Should I bring some water? Give it to me. Hold that. Bring some more. This is beauty. - You must press on it. - I'm trying. That's it. FRIDAY Keep going! Harder! Kick the door. Get up and come inside. Is he your new hand? He has penetrating eyes. Your journey is short. You'll part with him soon. That's what your stones say? He doesn't have a mother? Nobody breastfed him? I don't know. His breath is cold. You must warm him up. I don't know how. I'll explain it to you. Kill it. I'll let it go. If you want to. Its time had come. You can't change that. Quiet. Don't move. Don't breath. Stay where you are. Go and finish him off. Come here. Take the cartridge. Why didn't you shoot him? Were you scared or did you pity him? A wounded wolf plays dead to gain strength for an attack. - The hunter's come to visit us! - Greetings. Greetings to you too. Sit down. How long has he been walking it like this? You'd have milked a mare twice by now. Maybe that's enough. A young woman, at my age... What for, without virility? Greetings. - Peace be with you. - How are you? - Who's that boy? - Is it quiet here? - Yes. Thank God. A lone wolf is roaming around here. I'm following his tracks. Maybe he's following yours. Hey, Ajsha! Get off that camel. Go home! She's unhappy. Did you see herders in the mountains? They didn't scatter? No. They moved off into the Turtle Mountains. Drink your tea. I'll be back. Your face all aglow Disturbed my peaceful thoughts I regret that I met you so late That I won't look at you forever... Your hands are soft. But why are they so cold? I see the moon in your face I love you dearly, you are my spirit If only I'd met you before In my coltish younger days... When I was still happy... Get up! Get dressed. Come with me. Hurry! A wolf did this. Quiet. Look. You see him? He has five toes. Let's go. We're leaving. Put lotion on my back. Last night... Did you enjoy it with that tramp? Nothing happened between me and her. Nothing. She said I have cold hands. What's on your lips? Nothing. They're salty. You have that tramp's tears on your lips. In time, women will love you. Everybody says I'm cold. I don't know why. Last night I felt warmth for the first time. That woman... She's very beautiful. What's that drivel? Look at me. Now look straight into my eyes. True beauty isn't a woman. Beauty is fleeting, seen out of the corner of your eye, like the mountains or the sky. Let's go. Get on the horse. Be careful. He has a mind of his own. Go! They say a white deer lives in these mountains. No one has ever seen him. Only the pure and innocent can catch a glimpse of him. What scared you? - I don't want strangers here. - You're a stranger here. Look in the mirror. Look carefully. You never slept beside your mother. She's not your mother. Come outside. Find yourself a warm spot. What are you reading? A book. HALF A YEAR LATER Take your clothes off. Lie down beside your mother. Fool! Warm her up with your body or she'll die. She needs human warmth, not a fire. Do as I do. - Mummy... - Turn around. You've grown up. Your hand is warm. I'll go now. The fear has subsided in him. Come on, open your mouth. Say farewell to the hunter. We'll meet again. Don't let your breath grow cold. Get up! Hands behind your back. Come here! Open your mouth. Number three... Number four... Number five... Number six... Number seven... Hands behind your head. Move closer together. Push into each other. I said move closer! FOUR YEARS LATER Dress ranks! Front! Captain, Almaty juvenile delinquent section assembled. Attention! Eyes right! Front! Eyes right! Stop. Eyes right! Front! Right face! Quick march! Come inside. We'll have tea. How did the hunter die? I don't know. Nobody knows. Some say the wolves ripped him to pieces. Some say his time had come. The shaman found his belongings and his horse in the mountains. Go away! Go away! Where do you want to take my son? Go and don't come back! He's my only... Go away! That's all of it. The hunter's things. A saddle, a rifle, a knife, a harness... a saddlebag, shoes... I almost forgot. Here's his notebook or some kind of book. Did he leave any debts? Let's see. Several boxes of ammunition, horse feed... - And a couple of small things. - Put it on my bill. All right. Greetings. Greetings to you too. Where have you come from? The Turtle Mountains. I'm a hunter. Drink. Son, come and greet the hunter. Do you recognise him? Five years ago the hunter gave him his blessing. I recognise him. How did the hunter die? He hadn't visited for a while. Drink your tea. Do you know how the hunter died? No, nobody knows that. - Don't howl, you'll bring wolves. - Thank you for the tea. We could have prepared meat. Are there many wolves in the mountains? Many. A lone red wolf is roaming around here now. He doesn't fear people or dogs. He comes to kill the sheep. This is our younger son. Do what the hunter did. Bless him. Grow strong and flourish.
