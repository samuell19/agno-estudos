[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [gasps] Help! Help! Help.. [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] Excuse me. Any chance you're interested to tour? We're offering special on. New England architectural elements featuring.. Cornices. No, thanks. Cornices aren't my thing. Yeah, me neither. So.. Your first time on the island? Yeah. No. - I was actually born here. - That's impossible! Been in summering in Selkie my whole life. I'd remember you. Did you just turn summer into a verb? I did. - I'm TJ. - Miranda. You're Amelia's daughter. - You know Amelia? - Well, yeah. I mean, it's a pretty small island. 'Everyone knows everyone.' I suppose you do sorta look alike. I wouldn't know. I haven't seen her since I was preverbal. My dad kind of died and Amelia's my next of kin. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah, thanks. Well, brace yourself. The return of Amelia's long lost daughter is gonna be the biggest news around here since.. General store was robbed like ten years ago. Any chance I'll be no news? - Probably not. - Okay. [TJ] 'So how long are you in town?' I don't know. I don't even know where I'm going to live. The address my social worker gave me just said, "The Mariner." New Englanders still practice the fine old tradition of naming our homes. I live in Beauport. You can tell it's fancy 'cause it's French. Wanna see your new pad? Wait, like right now? Yeah. Come on.

Please tell me that doesn't mean what I think it means. No cell tower on the island. Or internet. Except for the coffee shop in town. Worried about that boyfriend of yours back in.. Portland.

Oh, this is nothin'. Wait till you see some of the yachts at the club. Including yours? [Ginny] 'Hey, TJ!' - Friend? - Girlfriend, actually. Kind of. - Right. - Hey, hottie with a body. [chuckles] Hi! God, I missed you! Oh, is this the Miller's new au pair. Do you speak English? Uh, Ginny, this is Amelia's daughter. Oh! Oh, my God! I am so embarrassed. I, I saw those cut-offs and I just assumed.. - Sorry. - I'm Miranda. Ginny Cunningham. I would invite you to come to the club with us but I'm sure you and Amelia have a ton of catching up to do. - Yeah. - Oh, there's Quire. - She has the party favors. - 'Oh!' Bobby's already waiting for us. Yeah, well, uh, I'll catch up with ya. Okay, well, hurry up. Well, guess I better get this over with. [Amelia] 'Miranda!' Sure you don't want back-up? I don't mean to brag but moms love me. Wish I could say the same. [instrumental music] Hi. Hey. How was the ride over? Fine. Boaty. Oh, you-you must be starving. Let's get you home. [instrumental music] This place is huge. What do you do? I.. I tried Googling you but I didn't find much. Greg never told you anything about me? Didn't ask. Well, um, I got my degree in art history. But, right now, I mostly write. Exhibition announcements, art reviews.. That kinda thing. Cool. What about you? Any hobbies? - 'Or do you play sports?' - Uh, no. Hand-eye coordination isn't really one of my skills. You get that from me. I can't throw a ball five feet. My bag is kind of heavy. Can you show me where I'm sleeping? Sure. 'This way.' [indistinct music] Hey. Is your vision getting worse? 'Cause your crazy hot girlfriend is over there 'getting easier by the second.' Not sure want to be tied down this summer. Okay. Just let me know when you're done with her. 'Cause I'm totally down for sloppy seconds. Classy! Alright! All aboard! Oh. 'Oh, cheers.' [chuckling] God, I love summer. Hey, I heard you met Amelia's daughter on the ferry. - I did. - 'Okay.' So tell me everything. I don't know. She seemed pretty cool, I guess. What's her deal? Why has she never been here before? Okay, her mom and my mom are like best friends. And she said the divorce was like, super-messy. Apparently, she grew up in Portland with her dad. - Guess he died pretty suddenly. - 'Tragic!' Let's invite her to the club tomorrow and get the story. Why? So she can offend us all with that flannel? Shit! Hey, dad. This your idea of discussion? Hey! Whatever, we're all friends here. Don't look at me. I didn't touch it. Ginny, have you heard from your parents today? Uh, yeah, right. They're in Paris. Why? I got a call from the dock master. Your cousin went for a dive and didn't come back. Now did she tell you she was prepping for an overnight? Kit is fine, she will show up tomorrow with some fish skeleton and like a three-hour explanation on why it's a prehistoric fossil or something. Okay. Just uh, uh, do me a favor. Gimme a call when she turns up. Okay. Sure. Hey. Surin Beach? Let me know if you hear anything. You hate it. No. I-it's good. You know.. We should talk about where you'll go for senior year. - Do I get a say in that? - Of course, you do. It's your future. Didn't get a choice about coming here. Look. I know how close you and dad were. And what a nightmare this has got to be. But.. It's gonna be a really long summer if you're not willing to give this a chance. Sorry. So, what is there to do around here? Well, have you ever been sailing? We could take the boat out tomorrow. Or there's a pool at the club. We could order lunch and go for a swim. I don't know how. Greg never taught you? - Dad couldn't swim, either. - Oh, of course, he could. He was a life guard all through college. I didn't know that. [spoon clanks] [instrumental music] Is it okay if I go for a run? Sure. There's a path to the dunes. Uh, make sure you turn around when you reach the bluffs. Hey, do you want me to come with you? I'm trying too hard. Aren't I? A little, yeah. Just be careful. Okay? ♪ Street are docks ♪ Frozen there ♪ 'Cause I saw ♪ Stuck in the shallows ♪ I saw ♪ Stuck in the shallows ♪ Saw ♪ Stuck in the shallows ♪ Shallows ♪ All around ♪ [indistinct singing] [waves crashing] [eerie whispering] [instrumental music] [whispering continues] [Leo] 'Hey! Hey.' What are you doing? I don't know. You can't swim here. But surfing is totally fine? Right. Well, we're good. I'm not going back in. I can't actually swim. [whispering continues] That sound. I've never heard anything like that before. You heard that? Uh, yeah. I don't know. Must've come from one of the boats. Weird. I'm Miranda. Leo. Whoa. What happened there? Boating accident. [eerie music] You should get going. Water's coming in. Yeah. Whoa. [water gurgling] It was nice to.. [eerie whispering] [panting] [whispering continues] - Miranda. - Ha! - Are you okay? - What are you doing? - Were you following me? - You were gone a long time. I was worried. Sorry. I.. I just got spooked. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. I'm fine. [intense music] [birds chirping] [instrumental music] [music continues] [engine revving] You're right. The new girl's hot. - Her name is Miranda. - Miranda? Well, did you hand Miranda your balls outright or did you just put a sold sign on your junk? - Shut up. - Ha-ha. You know, it just seems like a lot of work when Ginny's still dyin' to climb that that teach strip pole, if you know what I'm saying. Believe it or not, I can decode that sort of metaphor. - Want that? - Mm. - Be right back. - Alright. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Couldn't manage one day with outside contact? Yeah. Something like that. I get it. Your boyfriend probably misses you. Yeah. Javier gets really upset when I don't check in. He's a bodybuilder. So I don't like to make him mad. Plus, I also have to email social services to let them know Amelia hasn't locked me in the basement. 'Cause that's something we're worried about. Probably not. One second. Nelson here was actually just wrapping things up. Thanks, Nelson. So, what do you have to do tomorrow night? I was thinking a little brooding maybe penning some angsty poetry, for sure avoiding awkward conversation with my only living relative. You know, the usual. Tried out the whole poetry thing for a while after my mom passed away. My eye in [indistinct] definitely needs work. - I'm so sorry. - Thanks. Anyway, if you get bored of poetry, there's this thing happening down at the yacht club tomorrow night. 'Sort of an island tradition to kick off the start of summer.' You should come. Good for angst-drowning. - Yeah. Maybe. - Alright. I'll see you there. [computer beeps] [indistinct chatter] [keys clacking] [instrumental music] - Oh, my gosh. You're Miranda. - I'm Cece N. Cooper. My mom told me not to bother you this week because you and your mom have like tons of bonding and whatever to make up for, but I'm pretty sure she just said that 'cause her Botox went a little wanky and she's desperate for company. Anyways, I couldn't wait to meet you. Plus Ginny says you're a total freak. Which means, we're gonna be BFFs. - It's nice to meet you. - What are you doing right now? Do you want to grab ice-cream with me? My treat, I mean not that I don't think you can afford ice cream. You're.. You don't seem poor or anything. I just... wanna be nice. - I have to be somewhere. - Okay. Sorry, uh, you caught me in weird moment. - Cece, right? - Right. I guess I'm having a hard time coping with moving to a small town where everyone knows my height, weight and shoe size. Oh, no one can get your shoe size. I've been trying all day. [chuckling] Ginny goes to Deerfield, but, you know my parents aren't into the whole catholic-school thing. Bobby and TJ go to Exeter. Bobby's dad, he used to play football. But you know, he owns like seven restaurants. He's a creeper. And Kate's totally bulimic but we all pretend not to notice. And that sends her toward the cove. Everything else is tiny territory which is better left than explored. [instrumental music] [Miranda] Hey, what do you know about Leo? Not much. Townies usually avoid the heirs. Airs? - Heirs with an 'H?' - Ah. 'It's what the townies call the summer people' "cause we all inherited land.'" Come on. Let's go say hi. - N-no way. He's hot, but he's... - What? Four? Disturbed. There's a ton of stories about that guy. Leo. Hey. What happened to your scars? You seem very interested in my body. I'm not. I just wanted to say hey. Hey. [TJ] Miranda. - You okay? - I'm fine. We were just leaving. TJ, you didn't tell new girl the rules. It's not really a good idea to friend the help. You're right, you never know when we might uh, piss in your champagne. - Bobby! - Oops. Careful. I doubt they teach you to throw a decent punch at Exeter. Oh, fish stick wants a fight. [Miranda] Stop it. Nobody wants a fight. Do they? - Come on, Bobby. - Yeah, it's no problem. I got to get back to the restaurant, anyway. My dad is having an issue with one of the waitresses. She keeps propositioning to customers. Oh, wait a sec. Her name is Naomi. Isn't that your sister? Oh. This is a small world. - What are you doing with him? - Me? What are you doing with that guy? Bobby, he's a dick but he is harmless. And Leo's not? [male #1] 'Can I get some help here?' 'Is she alright?' What? [indistinct gasping] - Oh, my God. - Is that.. - Kit. - Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. [instrumental music] Fishing crew found her body tangled in the lines. I guess she wasn't a very strong swimmer. Kit was an experienced diver. She drowned. She could've misjudged how much gas was in her tanks or hit her head or lost consciousness underwater. There were, um.. Thought she had like.. Something got to the body after the fact. Could've been a seal or a shark. I've called the mainland police. They're sending an ME. Look, I don't need a corner to tell me the cause of death was drowning. Her lungs were full of water. Well, if there was something in that water.. I think we need to know. What's your relationship to Kit Morgan, Mr. Elinsworth? I'm the Cunningham's legal counsel. And until they're back from Europe I'm also Ginny's guardian. What about the victim's parents? You need family to identify the body. Uncle Lou is like 80. He has Alzheimer's. That's why Kit was staying with us. Dan'll be back by the weekend. Now, if you'll excuse us.. The family could use some privacy. I've to pick up my dress from the tailor's and get my nails done before tonight. Look, Ginny. No one expects you to go tonight. You know that. I'm fine. I'm not gonna miss the heirs party. - You sure? - Yeah. - I'll see you later, okay? - Yeah. [sighs] It's happening again. I saw Kit's body. That wasn't a seal or a shark. No point in jumping to conclusions. Alright? Let the ME do his thing. - But, dad... - Look, TJ. Enough. You'll make it harder on the family than it already is. Okay? [birds chirping] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [Miranda] 'Amelia.' [knock on door] Come in. Omg. Did you even bathe today? No, actually. Right, okay, go sanitize while I find something acceptable in here. - For what? - Um, the heirs party. It's not cancelled? They found a dead body yesterday. Well, it's not like she was an heir. A human died. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Sorry, I didn't mean to be an... I guess I just meant that it's your first day here it's not like any of us even met her. Still seems wrong to have a party. Well, if it makes you feel any better there will be a moment of silence and a very tasteful slideshow. [Cece] Hmm. Ooh. This blue dress doesn't suck. Come on, stand up. Will the townies be there? No. No, no, no. No, no. Leo was hot, but he's unbalanced. Do everyone a favor and help TJ cheat on Ginny instead. What's the deal with them, anyway? TJ and Leo, not TJ and Ginny. Unsolved mystery. Leo's mom used to clean TJ's house. And they were like best friends. And when Mrs. E died Leo just dropped TJ. TJ was totally destroyed. Leo didn't even show up for the funeral. Now, go bathe before I call Hazmat? Thank you. [electronic music] Why is everyone looking at me? The same families have been coming here for a hundred years. People are curious about you. That's all. Unless Ginny told everyone you got herpes. This must be Miranda. Look at you two. Getting on like gangbusters. Leanne Twinies Cooper. Cece's mom. And a good friend. What a blessing for you to be back with your mom. You must've missed her so much out there in Portland. It's so sad about Kit. I don't know why they didn't close. Siren Beach after Molly died. [Leanne] That place is a death trap. And that poor girl's body was covered in bite marks. It looked more like scratches. We went for a walk yesterday. 'Sort of near the docks. Barely saw anything.' I'm really thirsty. Uh, Miranda, come. - Bye, moms. - What's Siren Beach? It's where the locals like to surf, but it's dangerous. Every year, someone dies on the rocks or in a rip tide. Is that the beach at the end of the footpath? Yes, and I never want you going there again. I'm gonna go find Cece. The teenagers usually hang out in the pier, so.. Us old folks can pretend we don't see them drinking. [electronic music] Something to drink, miss. Thanks. [Leo] 'Careful down there.' I'm fine. [Cece] Miranda. Did you get stuck talking to some old people? [Miranda] Something like that. Oh, well, then you definitely need a drink. Guys, this is Miranda. Miranda, this is everyone. 'You know Bobby and that's Jake and... ' - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, you made it. - Yeah. Javier missed his flight, modeling emergency. Who? [Ginny] 'TJ?' Hold on one second. - New girl, you down? - I'm in. [chuckles] Took this from my son earlier. I'm good. Wouldn't have throw your brother the work tonight if I had have known you would turn into a damn prude. I'm not. I'm just sober now. [instrumental music] You've been up to an awful lot of things lately. You're a kid, you should be having fun. You are married. Sir, they're ready to start the speeches. - Did he hurt you? - No. You don't have to keep working for that dickhead. There are other jobs on the island. And they pay as well though. [Finley] 'Hey, Naomi.' Chicken's lookin' for ya. You want me to jack off in his drink real quick? Yeah, tempting, but, uh, no. I'll take this one. Of course, you will. What is that supposed to mean? Have the heirs accepted your application yet or is it still on the wait list? Just because I don't think they're disposable doesn't make me one of them. I'll get it. It's fine. I'll go see what Bobby wants. I got it. [music continues] Okay, never have I ever given head. No-no that's so not fair. Drink up, bitches. [coughs] Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I ordered the hot slutty Macleod. Well, ask and you shall receive. Someone smell that? Oh yeah, that right. You're a fisherman. You know I really need to discuss 'hiring policies with my father.' Chum Bucket isn't the atmosphere we're going for here at the club. Weird, the only thing I smell is privilege and date rape. [chuckling] Another bottle of tequila. [Ginny] It's your turn Miranda. And don't worry.. No one's used, "Never have I ever had sex yet." Never have I ever gone swimming. [Cece] What, you mean today? I mean like ever. Well, you'll never survive a summer on the island a swim virgin. Never have I ever gone skinny-dipping. Let's go, right now. What do say, new girl? I'm in. We're not like seriously going skinny-dipping, are we? Our parents are right there. Fine, let's go to Surin Beach. Virginia. Mother? You're supposed to be in Europe. You locked me out of the house. 'We're leaving.' - 'Now.' - Come with me. Uh, I don't wanna intrude on family time. 'Virginia.' [music continues] - Who's coming? - Surin Beach? Come on! It'll be fun. No way. That's where Kit died. Jake, my friend, if you ruin my chance of seeing many many boobs tonight, you'll die too. Okay? - Jake and I are in. - Wanna come? - No, no. He's not invited. - I just invited him. No, thanks. I've seen enough dead bodies this week. Come on! Let's go. [electronic music] Hey, counselor. You look grand. Motherhood hasn't aged me? You know it hasn't. So how's it going with Miranda? She fluctuates hourly between active loathing and icy indifference. Well, she's a teenager. That's normal. Any update? I haven't found a police report. Sheriff Wood's been dead for years. I mean, if there's one at the station, it is buried. That isn't good enough. Miranda is here now. Just tell her the truth. - Just get out in front of it. - Not an option. Teddy, please, I finally have my daughter back. I can't lose her again. You know I could be disbarred. I thought, of all people, you'd understand the importance of protecting family secrets. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Right! It's boobs o' clock. Wow! I'm surprised you have your clothes on this long, slut. What? Jealous Bobby only wants to see me naked? ♪ Dream the moon in your eyes up in the cloud ♪ ♪ All the nights we'd sit outside ♪ ♪ And wonder all the magic in your eyes ♪♪ You can't back out now. - This was your idea. - Right. You know if you want, you can cling to my manly biceps. And risk the wrath of Ginny? No, thanks, I'd rather drown. On the ferry, I.. I wasn't trying to play you. Ginny and I go to different boarding schools. I didn't want to break up with her over the phone. I was gonna do it when we got here, but, uh.. But then her cousin died? [instrumental music] Come on. Guys, this is a really, really bad idea. Like, really bad. [Bobby] Think we'll find a leg out here? Heard a kid only came back with three limbs. Gross and untrue. My dad says this beach is haunted by all the people the seawalkers killed. The what? New girl doesn't know about seawalkers. Well, seawalkers are this 'ancient race that run the seven seas.' And now they got claws out to till here and big long ass pointy teeth. Look, people are kind of obsessed with them here. Seawalkers are an urban legend parents used to use to keep the kids off this shore. Let's just go. Last one to get wet is the wet frigid prune. [gulps] - Whoo! - 'Whoo!' - 'Faster!' - Whoo! Whoo! [chuckling] What's the matter? Scared? I don't feel anything anymore. [music continues] [Cece] 'Hey!' Be that as it may as a life guard, it's my moral obligation to provide you with a floatation device. - Thanks! - 'Guys, hurry up!' ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh [laughing] [indistinct chattering] ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh ♪ [indistinct chatter] [gasps] Keep laughing, but everyone is afraid of something. Not me. Lemme guess. Spiders? [chuckles] - Heights? - Nope. Mm, I know. Hounds. Failure. [gasps] - Not funny! - That wasn't me. Let's go back in. [Miranda screams] Miranda! TJ! Miranda! [intense music] [music continues] [gasps] [coughs] [TJ] 'Miranda!' Miranda! What happened? Leo. He saved me. He was, he was just here. [instrumental music] Keep it. You're still shivering. Sure you're okay? Aside from my damaged pride, all good. I'm so sorry, Miranda. Should've never let you go in the water. Let me? TJ, I'm a big girl. I make my own bad decisions. You're sure Leo was there? I mean, no one else saw him. - Positive. - I mean, that's weird, right? The waves and the fogs just came out of nowhere. And Leo saves you and just disappears? TJ.. Ah, it's nothing. Just drunk... and stupid. That make two of us. [music continues] Thanks for walking me home. [exhales sharply] [water gurgling] [eerie music] [gasps] [instrumental music] The call's getting stronger. No. We need to go to the caves tonight. We're almost out of time to be on land. You ever hear about one of the heirs.. Hearin' it? The call? What kinda question is that? [Finley] 'You heard anything interesting?' Uh-oh! I feel a lecture comin'. They're doin' an autopsy on Kit Morgan. They're gonna know it wasn't a shark. Who cares? Let 'em try to figure out what kind of an animal does that to a body. [Leo] There wasn't supposed to be a body. Don't you get it? They're gonna comb Surin Beach. And they won't stop until they find somethin' to blame. She had a knife. It's harder than we thought. You dragged my sister into this? I wanted to help. I needed someone with balls to back me up. Leo, you know exactly why that girl had to go. You just didn't wanna have to be the one to do it. So come on, brother, cheer up. She's dead. We should be celebrating. Right? [instrumental music] Right. - Leo.. - Just deal with the body. Okay? [intense music] [knock on door] I'm here to I.D. my cousin's body. Sheriff Colley said your mom would be coming. Yeah, well, this isn't the kinda thing she does. This is the kinda thing she makes me do. So can we get it over with, please? [intense music] It's this way. [Dave] Are you sure you don't wanna wait for you mom or dad? It's pretty bad. [music continues] [inhales deeply] That's Kit. I'm so sorry for your loss. I just wanted to make sure she was really dead. She's entitled to half of Nana Morgan's estate. Should I g-get you something? Water, somethin'? No. I'm fine. Do you need anything else? [music continues] [retching] [coughs] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [music continues] "Seawalker's kiss?" [door creaks] [door opens] [instrumental music] Deputy Dave? Oh, my god! [gasping] [smoke alarm blaring] Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Help! [coughs] [instrumental music] [Ginny] 'Fire! There's a fire! 'Somebody help me!' 'Let me out!' Ginny? [Ginny] 'Help me!' [fire alarm blaring] Ginny! Ginny! Help! Ginny, are you okay? Okay, we have to go this way. [explosion] [sobbing] [grunts] Come on. Go, go, go. [Ginny] I'm telling you, someone was in there. [female #1] You're still in shock. It's been a long week for you and your family. I heard something and then there was smoke and fire 'and all the doors were locked.' Nothing on this island is up to code. And that building is a 100 years old. I'd be surprised if there wasn't a wiring issue. [Amelia] 'Miranda!' - Are you alright? - I'm fine. - Are you hurt? - Amelia, I'm fine. [exhales] [instrumental music] [sobbing] [music continues] [eerie whispers] [instrumental music] [Amelia] 'Miranda?' How are you feeling? The EMT said you might wake up feeling a little wheezy. - From the smoke. - I'm okay. You know, maybe we should visit the mainland ER. We-we could still take the afternoon ferry... Seriously, I'm good. I.. I don't know if I can ever forgive you for abandoning me. But I wanna try. [music continues] Thank you. Is this a seawalker? Yeah. It's been in the family for ages. Can you tell me about them? Y-you wanna know about island folklore? People keep talking about seawalkers. I'm... just curious. Okay, sure. Uh, what do you wanna know? I heard they can pass themselves off as human. So the legend says. From what I remember, they can only stay on land so long before they have to go back with the tides. There's a call to remind them. Supposedly, if they ignore it they run out of air and it kills them. Unless they steal the breath from a human's lungs. The seawalker's kiss. Yeah, people call it that because from a distance.. It looks romantic. [Miranda] What happens to the person who gets kissed? They die. So people say. But I think you're safe. It's just a legend. You want some coffee? [music continues] [seagulls squawking] Hey. What are you doin' here? I wanted to thank you for saving me the other night. You ran away so fast, I didn't get a chance to. Yeah. No problem. How did you see me? The waves were like ten feet tall. Just luck... I guess. I gotta get back to work. I saw your eyes.. In the water. I should hope so. They're right here on my face. They were glowing. Like, full on, "X-Men" mutant glowing. Next time you go swimming, lay off the tequila. I wasn't drunk when I saw your scars on the beach. Where'd they go? [instrumental music] You're welcome for saving your life. You need to go. Fine. What you doing? Going back in the water. You can't swim. - So teach me. - No. Fine. ♪ Crazy 'cause I know ♪ I wanna jump ♪ Crazy 'cause the feeling keeps me high ♪ ♪ Crazy 'cause we all might die ♪ ♪ In a dark sky night love ♪ In a dark sky night ♪ Crazy 'cause I know that I'm alive ♪♪ Disappointed?

You're a good friend. Don't pretend this was an act of kindness. I hope it was worth it. Here. Thanks. [instrumental music] - Stop looking. - I'm not. So, uh, how come you've never visited the island before? My dad.. Kind of had a thing about water. I miss him so much. He just died. And everyday I wake up.. And I remember all over again. And..

Please don't do this to me. I'm so messed up right now. Kit was like the one person in my family who wasn't awful. - And now she's gone. - And I'm sorry. About your cousin, I really am. But I can't do this anymore. [instrumental music] Nay? It's her. Isn't it? What are you talkin' about? Miranda. That's why you were asking so many questions yesterday. I saw you with her on the beach. ... I thought it was dad, but it was you. You've been following me. I haven't been following you, I've been following her. Do you know what Finley'll do if he finds out that you're protecting her? He already thinks that you're a traitor, Leo. Miranda heard the call. And the other night when she fell in the water, a shockwave or something came out of her body and everything lit up. I've never seen anything like it. You shouldn't have saved her. She's special, Nay. What if she can save us? [grunts] I'm sorry. [club music] [indistinct chatter] Hey, are you good? - Should we... - No way. Whatever happened, she deserves it. Last year, she told everyone I still had my V card. I mean, I do, but... it's not intentional. It's not like I'm saving myself for marriage. - Wouldn't judge you if you.. - But I'm not. And I was gonna do it with Zack Parish just to get it over with and Ginny had sex with him on purpose so I couldn't. I've even told TJ. [Bobby] Hey, hey. Hey. New girl! Okay, pick a fist. Pick-fisting. Ugh... left. Left. Oh! Excellent choice. Yeah, that's either a oxy or ady. I don't know, I-I dropped the bottle, so I mixed them up. Hard pass. [chuckles] [dramatic music] [bottle clinking] [Bobby] Oh, ho! Whoa, hey! [chuckles] Shouldn't you be busting a table... somewhere? Actually, your dad gave me the night off. He seems to like me. - Get off my beach. - Or what? You're gonna pay your butler to throw us out? It's a public place. Alright, alright. Take it easy. Relax, let it go. Come on, go.

Yeah, just needed some air. - You okay? - Yeah. Ended things with Ginny. - Congrats? - Definitely. I really like you, Miranda. - TJ, I can't do this. - Sure you can. I'm not talking about anything serious. But I like you. And I think you like me. And you broke up with Ginny 30 seconds ago. - I'm not that girl. - Is this about Leo? What? No. Look, I know you two have history. But he saved my life the other night. Sure it wasn't the reason you're in trouble in the first place? Yeah, I am. He's a good guy, TJ. Are you kidding? You barely know him. I've known him as long as I've known you. You need to open your eyes. You saw what happened to Kit's body. You know she didn't drown. Nothing on this island ever happens by accident. Just ask your mom. What? [sighs] Did your dad ever tell you why he left Amelia? She tried to kill you when you were a baby. I know that 'cause my dad covered the entire thing up. Hey, wait. Miranda! [sighs] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [leaves rustling] Hello? [Leo] 'Miranda.' Are you okay? I'm-I'm fine. You're upset. - Did someone hurt you? - What? - No. - Sorry, I just thought.. Never mind. Don't look at me like that. What's wrong? - Miranda.. - Nothing. I just.. Hate it here. [Miranda crying] Me, too. I've gotta go. [music continues] Miranda? What are yo.. What are you doing? - Is it true? - Is what? Did you try to kill me? Oh, my God. Social Services doesn't know, do they? That's why dad wouldn't let you see me. He knew you were a psycho! You don't understand, I was trying to protect you. - I'm leaving. - Miranda... Don't touch me! Please, don't go. I love you. Then how could you do it? I-I can't answer that. Right. Get out. - Miranda... - Get out! [door slams] [sobbing] Go home, Naomi. I mean it. I can't let you do this. You need to stop thinking with your dick. Naomi, are you okay? Get to the water. Go. [engine rumbling] Go. I'll be right behind you. She's not worth dying for. [music continues] Fisherman, a waiter, and now a peeping tom. 'That's quite the resume.' Stay away from Miranda. Or what? What's the matter? Not feeling too well? Never better. [music continues] I know what you are. [groans] [groaning] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [TJ] Bobby! Bobby! Hey! Hey! Come on, let's go. [engine rumbling] [music continues] [Sic] Get him on the chair. 'Get him on this chair. Get him on this chair.' Hey, hey! Cece, Cece. Wh-wh-where are you going? - Home. Everyone bailed and.. - Home? No, no, no. No! Now, come on. The night is still young. It's still young. The beer is lukewarm. Are, are you okay? You seem conf... I've never been better. I've never been better. Just one, one more drink. One more drink. Come on. - Yeah. Okay. - That's it. Okay. We'll go get it. After you. After you.. [instrumental music] [Amelia] "Some legends say that seawalkers are our brethren. Passionate, feeling creatures ruled by basic human emotion." [knock on door] Some say they are monsters. - Miranda? - TJ? I'm sorry. I should've never said anything about Amelia. It's fine. Turns out you were right. Are you okay? Everything's so screwed up. I just want you to stay away from Leo. I wanted to take care of it myself, but Bobby just.. Bobby, what? He hit him so hard. He wasn't moving. What did you do? TJ, what did you do? [Amelia] "We all act like monsters sometimes." "Slave to our baser instincts." - Here you go. - Hm? Oh, thank you. - Can I have some? - Yeah! Yeah! You know, in retrospect I probably shouldn't have had that-that pill. There's three of you. But don't worry, they're both equally hot. [chuckles] We are all creatures driven by hunger.. And passion.. And fear. We all have secret places where we go. Places where we face our demons and fight to survive. There are monsters in the deep. But Miranda can never know. He will take her from this place. Greg will keep my baby safe. [music continues] Dad? [Naomi] 'What are you doing here?' - Where's your brother? - He's right behind me. I can't wait anymore. Leo? It's getting late. We have to hurry. [Naomi] What about Leo? Let's go. [instrumental music] [music continues] ♪ Oh cold tears I've cried ♪ Oh I lost track of time ♪ Everywhere.. Oh, my God! What did they do to you. Help!
