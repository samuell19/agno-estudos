For fuck sake, Leo! Not my fault your garden's a dump. Here we go again! You're gonna break the bed! You, crazy girl, you fall down and get back up laughing, but your laughter is a spit in the world's face. Nasty laugh Milla, beautiful Milla. You, when the beast takes over, and come your "I don't care, fuck off, I'd like to see you in my shoes". I read a sentence that was like you when you don't speak. "I'm tired of the pretty, I'm tired of intimacy, "I ride on storms, and I'll drown with no one to save me". No Milla, you won't drown, you float. Forget the seamen walking with kilos in their feet. I see them, they're wrong. They think the burden's on their shoulders but it's in their feet. Their mouths, their punching fists, are in their feet too! So, obviously, it doesn't work. You get it? Let me start over. We're here but we don't know where we at. We're elsewhere, everywhere. You, and your "I don't care, I float". Me, with my burdened feet like the others. A bit to the bottom, a bit with the wind. Take me Milla, lift me up just alittle. I'll go anywhere with you and you can invite a 1000 children, hair in the wind crying really loud. Look, Milla, Look! Listen! Do as you want, the world is collapsing, ordering you to stand up straight. All it takes is to move, the head, almost invisible, for it all to come to pieces. But not us. All this, you know already. Mechanic apprentice, with 3 years vocational certificate. Looking for apprentice with vocational certificate for agriculture production. Looking for roofer, insulation worker. Not serious should abstain. Then, abstain. Recruiting accounting assistant for unlimited contract. You'll be in charge of payroll, social tax for our customers.

Some strength! We'll need a... Well, I think that... You know the shoe technique? It'll break! It worked. Nice and bubbly! Thanks. -To your new job! -Cheers. Do you know Froo-Froo? I knew it before you! You know the mall. What will you do all these nights without me? I'll dream about you. I think it's clean, no? It's black! We twist it? Over there. -You should wash too! -No, I'm ok... It's been a few days, no? Asshole. Get in here, so I step all over you. I'm the one who'll step all over you. Always sulking.

A song, a song! What are you having, Leo? A whisky! Ok, ok! Coming up! Where did my lovers go? The ones that loved meso Back when I was beautiful Farewell unfaithful ones They are I don't know where At other loving dates Though my heart hasn't aged Where did my lovers go? A long cry of pain just pierced the storm. It's what we've feared, oh God, it's a ship wreck. Stronger with the flow, the mighty weather raged. All name their loved ones, all lament and cry. Four fisherman, alas, have drowned off Cape Levi. Under the fury of the wind, at all black wave turns, slipping past the lip of the cape. And leaps like a torrent into the dry harbor. Dragging along more than one frail ship, all in pieces, cracked and quaking unto the dying rocks. And the swelling waters roll, exasperated, broken bodies, dismembered vessels, piles of pebbles, clothes and silt. Oh, to other misfortunes your goodness defies. You who reign in heaven, and whose foot rests on the Demon's forehead. Taski Clean Rug. Taski Foam Rug. Taski Rubber Rug. Taski? It's the brand? Punctual stain removal... Spray twice. R5...

Every job I'll find, he'll come with me. That's how it is. But without work... There's no money! That's for sure. Can't live off government money... Welfare is just bare minimum. It's not much. -Like 700... -There's financial aid? There's some, but it's not enough to live on. No, but to pay for your studies. There's not much either. Not much, it's the same. You've got to have Mommy and Daddy, otherwise... True! Especially these days... Yes for sure. It's good? Delicious! Got some all over my fingers. On your skirt! I'll put it in the wash tonight. Good thing it doesn't stain once it's cooked. It's ok. Damn... Why do we put them upside down? To sterilize sit, it's a way to sterilize. Because the air gap... damn.
