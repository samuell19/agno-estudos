[Mom] She works very hard. [officer] I didn't mean to suggest anything. My colleague spoke to Kayla at the scene of the suicide last night. This is a real tragedy. My family's seen its fair share. There used to be three of us. It's… It's okay. This your little boy in the picture here? That's him. Losing a kid is the toughest. Got my own two boys, and I can't imagine ever... [Mom] Can I get you a drink or something? [officer] No, I'm good. [door creaking] Once Kayla's rested, I'd like to follow up on her statement if that's okay. [somber music playing] This used to be a good neighborhood. We were happy. We were. You okay there, bump? You haven't called me that in years. - Mom, something happened... - Is it still there? The pool. They tore it down, remember? - They don't work. - They're all we can afford. Lance can help. You keep taking his shit, you're gonna die. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? [ominous music playing] This used to be a good neighborhood. [Kayla] You see here, we have to talk in the ear and then it will record our voices, okay? - Ready? - [Ricky] I wanna go swimming. There's my girl. Saw you had a visit. - [door closes] - Fuck you, Lance. Can't have you talking about me. Pick up some coffee, would you? Your mom's out. Stay the fuck away from her. Hey, it's my responsibility to look out for the residents. There's no cure for what your mama's got. - I got the medicine... - Keep that shit out of my house. - I know you guys been through a lot. - You don't know anything about us. "Dear, Miss Edwards, thank you for your application for the position of junior programmer." [Kayla] That's mine. [grunts] "Now, unfortunately, we regret to inform you…" Ooh. When you gonna learn? Nobody around here ever amounts to nothin'. [paper rustling] Saw the eviction notice too. You need money, you come to me. Anything to help… Miss Edwards. [knocking on door] [disturbing music playing] [static crackling] [disturbing music continues] [Kayla] I don't know how many more times I can explain to you what happened. Yeah, I know. I know. It's just… I don't see how a video game can kill someone. I mean Pac-Man doesn't go around eating people. So what? I know what I saw. Yeah, no, I know, and she sounds crazy. She's not fucking crazy. She was fine. Everything was fine, then the game took control. - Is that what you told the cops? - It's what I'm telling you. You don't believe me? Kayla… Hey… Hey, I wanna believe you. - Just tell me where it came from. - [Isaac] I don't know. I have no way of knowing. It's house clearance. - Just in a lot... - What fucking use are you? Wait. Let me do some research. - I'll get to the bottom of this. - Yeah, you do that. You're so fucking smart. [door opens, closes] Fuck.

[Mom] Yeah, I'm in the bedroom. [narrator] Choose or die. - Get to the living room. - [Mom] I can't. It's gonna see me. Go quick. Hide behind the couch. [Mom] I can't. I can't move. - I cannot move from here! - Trust me. [Mom] Kayla, help me! I'm gonna go and hide. - I'm gonna go and hide! - No! No! [Mom] It's destroying everything. I can hear it. [narrator] There's no meat in the living room. You're hungry. It's trying to make me hurt you. Bathroom or bedroom? [Mom] Kayla. [panting] [narrator] Choose or die. [Mom panting] Wait there till I tell you to run. [Mom] What? What? What? Run where? Run where? Bathroom. It's in the bathroom. I want you to go right past. - Go straight for the front door. - [Mom] No. [Kayla] I need you to go right now. - Mom, do you see it? Go! Now! - [Mom] No, I cannot. I can't. Okay! Okay!

[sobbing] - [narrator] Choose or die. - [Mom] I don't wanna die. [sobbing] Kayla, I love… I love you, and I am so sorry. [sobbing] Go to the window. [Mom] I can't do it, Kayla! - You have to! - [Mom crying hysterically] [narrator] Choose or die. [Mom sobbing] Kayla, I can't hold the door! - [rat squeaking] - Oh Jesus Christ! - Move, Mom! - [Mom] I can see it! I can see it! [gasping] Help me! Somebody help me!

Landlord's gonna love this. - Get out. - [Lance] I gotta report it. - Unless… - Fuck you. [Lance] Maybe. What are you worth? Ten dollars? Fifteen for the hour? You take one more step, you'll find out what I'm worth. [chuckles] Everyone in the neighborhood used to look to your mom and be like… Well… She was really somethin'. Anyone was gonna make it out, it was gonna be her. [chuckles] I got a 20. [can hisses open] [grunts] [panting] [disturbing music playing] - [thunder rumbling] - [rain pattering] [banging on door] [Isaac] I am coming. Kayla? - What the fuck? - You have to believe me. I… I believe you. I believe you. Come inside. This is some fucked up shit. Be sure before you get involved. I'm sure. I'm sure, okay? Just get in. You're soaked. [Kayla panting] [Isaac] You weren't kidding. This is some fucked up shit. Can we turn it on? I tried. But listen, I checked what time it started itself up last night. 2:00 a.m. Same time as when I first opened it the night before. I think we gotta wait till then. [Kayla exhales] Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. Okay? After you left, I tried to find out what I could. It was a dead end. And there's nothing online. Literally. Not even an honorary mention on the forums. The prize line number's delisted. I wanted to see if somehow it was much more contemporary technology, but there's nothing in the code that'd begin to explain… [Isaac] I mean, yeah, it's just ordinary wrapper code. [Kayla] Yeah, so what's inside the wrapper? Well, some old games have code hidden in the analog loading sound itself. - Sound is data. - We could try to separate out the sound? Yes, we should. Yes, we should, Kayla. Okay. Where are you? When it loads, we'll be ready. [static crackling] You know what I mean? I feel like we're just scratching the surface of interaction in, like, player choices. Even just cheat codes. They're cool, but they're a bit standard. You know? You get left, right, A, B. You get to skip a level, or you power up. It's cool, but it's just easy. I am gonna reinvent the whole idea. So in my game, if you wanna cheat, it's gonna cost you. Like, uh… Like it's gonna hurt. Am I boring you? No. I am. I am boring you. No, really. It's… It's good that you're making something new. Something that's yours. Those, um… [clears throat] Those designs you saw? Those are just sketches by the way. Those… They don't mean anything. I like that you made me look like a superhero. [chuckles] Well, gotta make sure you use your powers wisely. You're such a dick. Whoa! Hey, what the fuck was that for? Do not start a food fight with me. I am a grand master. Go. Kayla. - [Kayla] Ew. - Sto... Did I get it in your mouth? Ah!

[synth-pop music playing] [tires screeching] - How long till the next level starts? - [Kayla] About six hours. [synth-pop music continues] [brakes screeching] [music stops] [disturbing music playing] Guess we're going in? You all right? [disturbing music continues] We gotta find something to bust this open. That works too. [exhales] What now? [Kayla typing on phone] [phone ringing] Where is that? [ringing continues] It's coming from there. [Robert on answering machine] Greetings. This is Robert Englund, horror royalty and Hollywood nightmare. Or should that be the other way around? If you're listening to this, then you're either a loser who isn't paying Mommy and Daddy's phone bill, or you have survived Curs>r. So, congratulations. You are worthy. [suspenseful music playing] Enter your four-digit prize code after the tone. And remember, reality is cursed. [suspenseful music intensifies] - Spend that money wise... - [switches off] [Isaac sighs] [clanking in distance] [clanking continues] [Kayla sighs] Guess we can forget that prize. There's gotta be something. There's gotta be. Hey, hey. Power cables. They gotta go somewhere, right? It goes in here. [creaking] Oh shit. Oh. Why leave it like this? [suspenseful music playing] They made the game here. [suspenseful music continues] [music intensifies] [static buzzing] Sorry. "Curs>r Beta 1." You promised me food, man. And we go back, March 12th, 1984 at 9:20 p.m. This is the first Curs>r beta test. Since we first discovered the curse, we've been unable to identify its origins or translate its exact meaning, but we know it has unusual properties. Its symbols seem to affect reality. Each… Each of them… [clears throat] Each of them means something. Fire… Water and… blood. Their power has lain dormant for centuries, but the myth suggests whenever they've been used against a… a person or persons, they, well, they suffer. Oh fuck. Pain, fear, trauma… And the more the cursed suffer, the more the curser benefits. We've converted the original symbols into 8-bit equivalents, contained them within a simple horror game experience, Choose or Die. - Choose... - What the fuck does that mean? Someo… Someone's been doing this to me? I will start the test now. [computer beeps] [buzzing] I am the curser. As I cause suffering… - [beeping] - I will reap the rewards. [mic feedback] The test has started. Curs>r. Yeah, real fucking original, man. [chuckles] [hits computer] [sighing] Okay… "You've been waiting for hours." "They promised you food, but where is it?" "Eat the computer?" "Eat your arm?" What is this, man? Just choose one. - This is bullshit. - You… You want your money? Hmm? Choose. Hey, when this is over, when I get my money, I'm gonna mess you up. Arm. [breathing heavily] Hey. Hey. Watch. [groaning] [man grunting] Keep shooting. Get it all. [ominous music playing] - [screaming] - [flesh squelching] [groaning] [man screaming] [developer] It works. It works. [panting] - [man shrieking] - [chuckles in disbelief] [chuckling] It's incredible! That can't be real. [developer] Sometimes… - Sometimes, a curse can be a gift. - [man panting] - [laughing hysterically] - [man screaming] [Isaac] This bit guy is fucking insane. I mean, we gotta tell them. We gotta tell the police. - Or... - [Kayla] See those? The symbol's the command prompt. Isn't it? It's the command prompt. It's what we were missing. [Isaac] We gotta get out. We'll take it back to mine. - [beeps] - The fuck? [high-pitched shrieking] - [Isaac] What is that, Kayla? - [shrieking] What's going on? It's too soon. Too fucking soon! Level four. You're in 1984. We gotta go. Kayla, we gotta go. I'm gonna reinvent the whole idea. In my game, if you wanna cheat… How's he doing that? …It's gonna cost you. - [Isaac] It knows we cheated. - Isaac, no. - [electronic buzzing] - Oh my, it's gonna hurt. - What the fuck? - [static crackling] - [distorted] What's happening? - [static crackling] [static crackles] Rewind or fast-forward? Isaac? [developer] Rewind or fast-forward? Help, Kayla. Choose or die. Choose or die. - Choose or die. - [Isaac groaning] [vomiting] [screaming] [tape forwarding] [Isaac screaming] [tape jams, repeating] Rewind or fast-forward? Rewind or fast-forward? [Isaac screaming] - [Kayla grunts] - [continues screaming] [laughing hysterically] Choose or die. Choose or die. Choose or die. - Do it. - [developer] Choose or die. Choose... [screaming] Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [screaming] [buzzing rapidly] - [whimpers] - Level four complete. [gagging] [coughs, gags] You're okay. [gasping] What did we… What did we win? Don't speak. - [grunting] I... - It's okay. It's okay. [Isaac gasps] I… I totally turned you on to... [coughs] Run-DMC. [gasping] [Kayla sniffles] [tearfully] You're so fucking smart. [Isaac coughs] [gurgling] [somber music playing] You're okay. - Isaac… - [computer beeping] Isaac. [sobbing, screaming] [developer] Now beat the boss.

Why would it do that? You tell me. [Gabe whimpering] You still playing? Not exactly. [sighs softly] I collect things, you know. From… from when I was your age. You probably don't know what they are. I mean, everything's in the cloud for you kids. So I, uh… I picked up the game in a clearance site. I thought it'd pass a couple of minutes, but… - But I think I woke it up. - [Gabe whimpering] And then… After two levels, it promised to leave us alone if I made copies. My friend is dead. [sighs] I, uh… [smacks lips] I really am devastated. Fuck you. If it sent you here, it can't be for anything good. - You bastard! - You let her go. - [Gabe whimpering] - It's okay… son. There's nothing to be afraid of. - [twisting arm] - [groaning] Now, everybody... Everybody just sit down. [Gabe whimpering] You know what I think?

Oh, that's… that's not fair. Aren't guys like me allowed to be the fucking hero anymore? - You know, in the '80s... - Fuck the '80s. [shouting] Fuck the '80s? You wanna be the hero?

[epic music playing] [developer] Since we first discovered the curse, we've been unable to identify its origins or translate its exact meaning, but we know it has unusual properties.

Sometimes, the curse… Can be a gift. I like that you made me look like a superhero. Well, gotta make sure you use your powers wisely. You're such a dick. [solemn music playing] [phone vibrating] [developer on phone] You've suffered. I've prospered. Yet somehow you managed to beat my game. Beck? Tell me… Who will suffer next?
