RETRIBUTION I can't believe it! You're still eating breakfast? Come on, I'm in a hurry. When you're finished, put everything in here. - Good morning, Alejandro. - Good morning, Carlos. Sorry to call so early but they're putting pressure on me . What is it? The news could leak anytime now . We need to get them back before the shit hits the fan . How much time do we have? The news could leak in a month's time , a week, two days... Does it taste good? Should we mention it to the customers? - Absolutely nothing . - How stupid can you get? But you like it! We'll offer them one of our funds in retum . Or one from Asia Europe America ,,. You know the guidelines on that. - If they object... - Marcos, Sara. - say it's for their sake . - In the car in two minutes. That our analysts see high profitabiIity . And clear the table! - Those derivatives have to be recovered . - I'm getting changed. Kids, you come with me. - Marta, I'll drop them off! - How's it looking? I'll cancel a meeting and go straight to the office. We'll sort it out. I knew I could count on you. Phone me when it's done. I have to tell the guys upstairs. - See you. - Okay. I'll call you. - Marcos. - What? - Have you got the key? - No, it was open. Sit in the back. I have papers in the front. Loser! What's that ball doing in here? At school they don't believe I got the real autographs. - Give it here. - No. - Ball! - Aw, go on. Bag. Come on. - Dad, that hurt! - Settle down. The car smells weird. Must be your bad breath. Be quiet both of you. I have to make a call. - Carlos! - Another show for the neighbors. What are you doing? I cancelled a meeting and the school's on the way. You said you couldn't take them, you had some damn appointment you couldn't cancel. I cancelled... I had to postpone my meeting because of that. I thought I was doing you a favor. A favor? Here, Marcos. Talking to you is pointless. - What's up, boss? - Victor? How's it going? Rojas called from head office. So early? I hope you hung up on him. Apparently the Lexin derivatives are toxic. Oh, shit. They expect us to retrieve them without spilling the beans. What sort of a feasibiIity study did they do? Forget that, we've got the hot potato. What do we say to the clients that bought them? WiIl we lose our commission on the ones we sold? I'll let you know in the office. Dad, answer it. I'll be there later. I'm going with Julia to her doctor . I gotta go. I'll see you in the office. Alright. Is this your mother's? Yes? Carlos? Yes. What did you think when you found your car unlocked? Who is this? What's going on? You're a son of a bitch, did you know that? What the...? - What do you want? - That's exactly the point. What I want. And you're going to give it to me . This is not funny. Shut up and listen. The three of you are sitting on a bomb that wiIl explode if any of you gets up. Did you get that? OFFICE Carlos good moming ,. Hello, Mercedes. Change the meeting with the real estate people to 11. Anything else? Yes, call head office and get them to send you the papers on the new application plans. - Okay? - Okay, see you soon. UNKNOWN Did you tell your boyfriend you're flirting with another guy? No, but I'll tell him you wet the bed every night. Mom told you not to joke about it. I'm not. Bedwetting is a serious problem. - See this message? - Idiot. Let's send it, maybe somebody can help us solve the problem. Look at the phone... I'm going to put that Marcos is a 9-year-old who pisses the bed. Look. Marcos, don't hit me. I'm not. Look, look. - Listen, Marcos. - Give me the phone. You can't reach me, you shrimp. Marcos, stop hitting me. I'd never leave the house if I were you. - Give me the phone. - Let go of my hair. - Then give me the phone. - Marcos, sit still. Dad! You're a pain in the butt. - Look what I'm writing. - Give me the phone. - Yes? - Never hang up on me again! You took your time answering. ? Did you tell anyone - No. - You better not. As of now, if you cut me off , if anyone gets up or if I feel like it , I'm blowing up the fucking car . I have my kids in the car. This is a joke. It's no joke. You picked a good day to take your kids to school. So get them to stay in their seats and you stay in yours . - Give me the phone! - Stay still. - Marcos, put your belt on. - Gee, Dad, what's wrong? - Stay in your seat and don't move. - Why? Put your belt on, Marcos. - Just because. - It was Sara. If you and Mom have a problem, don't take it out on us. Please stay in your seat. - But... - Because I say so! I want my money. What money? 67,547 in cash. And a 420,000 transfer to the account on your dashboard. And don't try to get your IT guys to fake the transfer data. Got it? It's impossible. It is possible. Even if I wanted to, it's impossible. The branch doesn't have the liquidity and I can't do transfer it unless I'm in the office. You can't work from outside precisely to avoid situations like this. Don't try to trick me . I've been working on this for quite some time. Today's Friday and the end of the month. There's plenty of payroll and pension money at the bank. 67,547 from your account, without arousing any suspicion . I don't have that much money in my account. You don't? There's 5, 779 euros in your account. 1 768 in your wife's , checking account and another 60,000 in her savings account . - That equals 67, 547 Euros. - Why have we stopped? The bank always comes first. How do you know all that? Go on move it , and get me my money. I'm following you on GPS and the bomb's on remote control, so don't do anything stupid. Listen, I still don't know if you're serious or not. You and your kids won't get out of this alive unless you give me what I'm asking for . - Understood? - Dad, the school! Dad, you're passing the school. Dad! There must be some way... Shut your mouth and Iisten . Either you give me the money or I press this button here . Fuck, I can't get that money. Don't jerk me around. - No, no, no. - You're the branch manager. - Of course you can get it . - Put your belt on. Both of you, stay put. Put your belt on. What's wrong? Will you two do as I say for once? - Why? - Because I say so. Put your belt on. Go ahead, tell them. Alright... A man called to say there's a bomb under our seats - and if anyone gets up, it'll go off. - A bomb? It's probably a joke... and I'm a schmuck, but I have to be sure. Well done. I'm just asking you to be a little patient. Are you serious? Those things don't happen here! - Smile... You're in YouTube. - Just don't move, okay? So what are you going to do next? Call the cops? If I hear you call the police, or see one cop near the car... boom. What you're asking is impossible. To handle that much money I have to be physically in the office. And even then, it isn't easy. Let's start with your 67, 547. Most of it is in my wife's name. - I don't give a shit . - I'm freaking out. Put it on speaker. I want to hear them jerk you around. Sara, please. I want your money and I want it now . Where'd this photo come from? Facebook. Mom uploaded it... when we were still a normal family. The cellphone photo. Look what a nice family you have . You're all so pretty. So do it for them . Do it for your family . - Where's the ball? - In the trunk. Why are these kids here? - Show it to us. - What's going on, Carlos? Guys, Marcos isn't going to school. - I knew you didn't have it. - I do, it's just there's a bomb under us. - A bomb... What a loser. - Get rid of them . Get down from there. Marcos was kidding, there's no bomb. Get down. Wait, wait. There is a bomb! You said it! , ? What's going on Carlos - Now they'll think I'm a liar! - Some friends of my boy. I'm trying to figure out how to get your money. Get out of there. Move it before things get more complicated . If I fail my exam Mom'll be so mad at you. This is incredible. Listen closely Carlos ,. I'll be in constant contact with you on the phone in the glove box . Call the bank on your personal phone so they get the money ready, then call your wife. Later I'll tell you where to deposit the money . Everything very simple , and no calling the police or anyone, understood? Yes. And remember, if you cut me off or try anything weird , I'll push the button and it's all over. I'll call the bank. - Hello, Carlos. - Hello, Mercedes. Listen, I can't go to the office today. Marcos fell off his bike and I'm taking him to Emergencies. Oh poor thing ,. I need you to do me a favor. ? Is he alright Yes, it's just a scare, nothing serious. Marta will drop by the office to sign for the money. I need you to close down my account, our joint account and the fund she has in her name. ? Everything Everything. I'll explain later. ? Why don't you do it here I have to take Marcos to Emergencies. And the transaction can't wait. Carlos, is something wrong? Careful what you say. Everything is fine. It's "hot" outside... "hot." - Do you understand? - "Hot"? Are you sure? That's the bank code to say that everything's fine. God you had me worried ,. Forget about your worries and take care of it. It's just under 68 grand. If you'd said "cold" I would've been scared to death. Sorry, but I'm still shaking. - Of course. - Carlos, don't get tied up. Have everything ready. Marta will be there shortly. - Give this priority. - Okay. It'll be done. Does Mom distrust you so much that everything's in her name? I need to pee. I always do before school starts. I'll call my wife now. Alright but remember what I said ,. Hi this is Marta ,. Leave a message after the beep. Marta, call me when you hear this. It's important. Problems with your wife? Yes, but it's fine, she'll call. I'm calling the branch. I need help from inside. I'll speak to Victor, the assistant manager. He's to be trusted. - He won't raise the alarm. - I'll bet. - Carlos. - Victor... listen. - This'll sound strange... - Excuse me... Listen to me. Someone's on another line saying he put a bomb under our car seats. Okay, Carlos, look... Listen, I need you to help me with a transfer. I'll take responsibility. Okay but you Iisten to me ,. This guy called me too! What? He called me too. Where are you, Victor? In my car. In front of our house. With Julia. What is this Carlos , ? Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yes, don't worry. Good God. The main thing now is to stay calm. - How can we be calm?! - I'm coming over. Get here quick and explain this . Keep a cool head. Go to their house, calm them down and start getting my money ready . Dad! Are you crazy? What are you doing, Carlos? What are you doing, Dad? What the fuck do you want? If I blow up now, so do you! - What was that? - You bastard! What the hell was that bang? Answer me! - Javi, are you alright? - Carlos! You just ran over Sara's boyfriend! ? What's your boy saying - What was that bang? - Are you crazy? Carlos, what was that bang? Don't you move from your seat. Just a bump with a scooter, but we'll get your money. Don't play games, Carlos. R emember the car's full of explosives . I won't, I swear, It was just a bump. I was distracted, I didn't see it. Don't take me for a fool. - You thought it was me, right? - It was an accident. Go ahead, keep risking your children's lives . ? And why doesn't your wife call - Sara. - What? - Call your mother. - You call her! - Call your mother, please. - Dad. You're going nuts. - Dad. - What!? I can't hold on anymore! That's okay. Just pee your pants, but don't move. Imagine your pants are your sheets. - The voice mail is still on. - Snap out of it . Call the university. The number? I don't know! Look it up online! Was that your boyfriend or the one you cheated with? Shut up, okay? You know this is important for me. Carlos! - Are you two alright? - What the hell is this? Everything's going to be fine. What he wants is impossible. This guy's crazy. - Please relax, Victor. - No way, damn it. Fuck that. We can't access the system from outside the office. Victor, listen to me. No, you listen to me! Carlos calm this idiot down , or he'll fuck it all up. Dad, I need to pee. - Do you know him? - No. Maybe the worst thing that'll happen is we'll get famous on YouTube for being scared shitless. That's what I told him. This can't be serious... You're skating on thin ice . Do you think you own the street? - Sorry. Take it easy. - Fuck. What matters now is that we do as he says. Okay? - Okay. - That's the way. Hold on a moment. Shit! Fuck! I told him how much money is in my account as well as yours. I got scared. Don't worry. Wait. Victor, I've got to go. What's your problem? Can't you see I'm parking? I have to park, it's urgent. It's the same for everybody. - Victor, what's wrong? - I have to go. Julia, what are you doing? You heard him. He thinks it's a joke too. - Hey! - Just a minute! Convince this hysterical woman . Do it or you're done for . - Julia, stay in the car. - Will you move it?! - I'm moving. - Julia, what are you doing? Move the car and talk to Julia, whatever. This is stupid, I'm going to the doctor. - I'm sure it is. - Hey! I'm moving. - No, Julia, don't! - Shut the door. She'll fuck it all up . Convince that fucking idiot now! , - Please, Julia. - Julia, listen. - I have to go. - Do you hear me? One minute, damn it. - Carlos! - Julia. - Shut the door. - Please listen to me. Let's not do anything stupid, okay? Alright? Okay? That's better. I'm sure you're right, but it's better to look stupid than risk our lives. However remote the possibility is. Julia, honey, please. Honey, shut the door. Good, honey, good. - It's fine. - Perfect Carlos that's it ,,. We're good. Now what the hell do we do? Whatever he says, okay? We've got no choice. You and Victor get me that money now, okay? - Yes, that's it. - No tricks . I want to hear everything, tell me step by step. - This is so silly. - You got me, Carlos?

Why don't you ask Mercedes to take the money out of the bank herself? She can't do it. She'd be personally responsible. Those are the rules in case there's a robbery.

Send it all to Mercedes at the branch. I'll handle the account from here. Everything will be set by midday. Good job, Carlos. You never let me down You're a genius .. - Thanks. - I was wondering, do you want to come with Marta ? and the kids sailing this weekend - Fried fish ... - Sorry, Alejandro... the doctor's calling, I have to go.

What's the matter? - Tum it off. - Carlos, what's going on? - It's the police. - Move or I'll explode the bomb. Go. Go, Carlos. Get out of there! Get out of downtown. - I have to go to the hospital. - Dad, slow down. Forget about the hospital now . Don't let them catch you. They're behind me! - Watch out! - Don't let them catch you! What are you doing? Slow down! - Look out! - Where are you going? Get out of there, Carlos. What are you doing? Dad, put on the brakes! Detain the vehicle immediately . - Freeze! - What's going on, Carlos? - The police. - Hands up! R elax. Keep calm and find an escape route . I can't! - You have to let us go. - Calm down, Carlos. - Find a way out . - Let me go. Kill the engine! Get out of the car! Take it easy. , ? Don't mention me got it - Tum it off and get out. - Don't switch off the engine . - Do you hear me? - You have to get out of there. - I can't. - You can't? That's it. Let me go! I can't let you go. Hands up! I want to see those hands, alright? We've been informed there's an injured boy with you. Is that true? Tell them to get their cars away, you have a bomb and you'll blow it up. - I'm trapped. - Don't talk to me just to him ,. - I'm trapped. - Stop talking to me, I said! - What's this guy doing? - There's nothing I can do. Let us get out. No one gets out before I get my money. - You still owe me 388,000. - Who are you talking to? 388,000. No, hands up, please. Calm down and tell me what's wrong. Tell them to get out of the way or you'll detonate the bomb. I can't get out... - There's a bomb under my seat. - Good. Tell him you'll blow up the car if they don't leave. Get those cars out of the way. Say it! Or I'll do it myself! If you don't let me go, I'll blow up the car! - What are you saying? - With two children behind you? Is that what you're telling me? You're going to blow up a bomb with two children back there? Who are you talking to? My finger's on the device . R emember what happened to Victor. Another car blew up. This morning, a Chrysler, with the same kind of bomb. Alright, alright... Okay, let the children get out. No one gets out, Carlos. Nobody. Let me go to a hospital and I'll let the boy get out! Both children. - Right, everybody back! - What's going on, Carlos? The cars blocking the exits! - You're fucked. - Call the Bomb Squad. You useless piece of shit. You promised you'd let my boy go. No, things have changed. So make your fucking calls . , ? You want to save Marcos right Then get my money. - Hello? - Sonia. Yes. Who's this? Hello? - Sonia, it's Carlos, from the bank. - Oh hi Carlos ,,. We're... I have to leave you, we'll talk later. Where's Espinosa? There, with the mobile unit. Please, evacuate the buildings calmly and clear the plaza. I repeat, evacuate the buildings calmly and clear the plaza. Please evacuate the buildings calmly and clear the plaza. I repeat, evacuate the buildings calmly and clear the plaza. H50 to K1. Clear this zone for me. I want full visual on the car. Requesting more units for cordoning off an clearing. Stay with the wife until I give the word. Hello, Belén. Inspector. Fill me in. Of course. Command is the mobile unit. 40 minutes ago we got a call from a man saying there was an injured boy in a car. He said the driver told his wife that he was being blackmailed and needed to take out all the money from her account and hand it over to some stranger on Plaza de los Jardines. Who's the caller? The wife's lawyer. They're getting divorced. Officer, when Special Ops arrives, they're to cover from above. - This side or the whole perimeter? - The whole perimeter. The ambulance is here! Back, please! A patrol car was in the area and stopped the delivery. Then we located the car and tried to arrest the driver, and this bomb thing came up. Now he's over there, with his two kids. It seems the boy is hurt. Any links between this man and the other victims? We still don't know the victims' identities. Close off those exits. I want the car immobilized. Has he demanded anything? Just that we should let him go. He's wearing an earphone and he indicated that someone is telling him what to say. - He's being blackmailed? - Or he wants us to think so. Let me see my children! - She shouldn't be here. - Right, but she is. - What's her name? - Marta. Please, I just want... - Let her go. - I just want to see... - how my children are. - They're fine. Marta, listen to me. My name's Belén. I'm the head of the Bomb Squad. If we confirm that there's a bomb, I'll take command. I need this area clear. It's bad for you to be in sight. Okay? Why is it bad? - My children are in that car. - I understand, Marta. That's precisely why I need you to be calm. I don't want them to see you. I want to see how my son is. Please. What, are you going to arrest her? They're her children. - Where else would she be? - You know we can't do that. Look at me. Marcos and Sara, your children, are now our children, the children of everyone in this operation. But we need to be cool and calm, for their sake. I need you to be calm in case they need your help. That's why she suggested you shouldn't be here. You'll be in a building nearby and I'll keep you up to date. Alright, Marta? He's right, Marta. - Let's go. - That's it, Marta, keep calm. - Thank you. - That's okay. Belén... A little tact wouldn't hurt, eh? I'm going to the car. Tell your men. This is best position for us. Any news? He's wearing an earpiece, we might be being observed. The son's hurt. So is the girl. - Inside the car? - Yes. Okay. - Mercedes. - Go ahead. Take 14,000 from Alicia Márquez's account. How's your side going? It's tuming out to be tricky , but I'm stiIl trying . I'll call you later. You're a good liar, but that doesn't surprise me . I see lying is normal in your family . How much have you got so far? 226,000 euros. Transfer the money to my account now. And you're stiIl down 162 000 ,. I can see the Bomb Squad with a dog next to your car. Don't make any more calls. Hide the cellphone , but I want to listen! And don't give it to her under any circumstances! It has a tracking device and I'll know if you do . Carlos, I'm Belén Blasco, Chief explosives expert. The dog's trained to sniff out explosives. Tell me what you want. Let us leave. I have to get my son to a hospital. Then let him out of the car and we'll treat him immediately. I can't. The dog smelled explosives. Oh my God. What about the witnesses to the explosion today? One identified the suspect at the site of the explosion. Moments later, he left. I want to talk to the wife. She's with the lawyer. Get them both to come. Carlos. I'm coming over to give you some water and a first aid kit, okay? - It's only water and... - Don't talk to me. And remember I'm watching you ,. Hello, Marcos. How did you get hurt? It was when the other car exploded. We'll get you out of there soon. Sara, are you alright? Why do you want to blow up the car? Please, let me get out of here. UNKNOWN Marcos needs urgent treatment. Anything we can do? Let me go and I'll let him out. I promise. Whatever your reasons are, I advise you to cut this out. I'll never be authorized to let a car with a bomb drive around town. Please let them out of the car. I can't. I'm stepping back, okay? But I'll be in sight at all times. You heard what she said. It's pointless to continue. And Marcos needs a doctor. Do you hear me? Say something. THROW AWAY THE WALKIE-TALKIE ? Do you think I'm an idiot Carry on with your calls. You're son's in a bad way , and you're making things worse . You're trying my patience . Marcos... Marcos, almost there. We're going to the hospital now. Sara's taking good care of you. Marcos, say something. I want to hear your voice. Say something. Marcos... Sara. It's Mom. Mom! Carlos... Carlos, please cooperate with the police . Any problems, whatever they might be, can be solved and we'll solve this one . Why did she say that? I don't know. I want to hug you... I want to hug all of you. , ? Carlos what's going on I want us to be a beautiful family again . You did great, really. That's it. Now we should get away from the car. Alright? Come on, Marta, let's go to a quiet zone. No one trusts you now, Carlos. Not your daughter not your wife ,, and soon your son. What are you doing? I'm trying to touch a nerve, so he thinks there's a future for him with his wife and kids. Now you've made him more jumpy. Please, don't interfere with my work. I remind you, I'm the one risking my life. Carry on with your calls. They'll track the transfers. Even if we manage it, it makes no sense. I've leamed a few things about banks . I know an account can be opened in the Cayman Islands and a network set up to circulate the money indefinitely . There'll be no way to trace it . Let my son get out, please. 488,000. You know that. Let my son get out, please! He's in a bad way! He's in bad shape! 488,000 euros. You're still down 162,000. Head Office is calling. Careful what you say. If they block the operations , you're all dead. Hang on, Marcos. Alejandro. I just spoke to the police . Are you alright? Yes, sort of. What's really happening? Is it true what they're saying about the bomb? I can't talk now. Good God, Carlos, I don't know what's going on. Only you do, and I hope you know what you're doing. I must ask if there's been any actions against the bank . Alejandro, I can't talk. I need you to confirm that you're aware of the protocol. I know the protocol. Okay. I therefore inform you that the bank wiIl not be responsible for your actions. You understand, don't you? What? This call is being recorded and we confirm that you'll be held personally Iiable for every action conceming customers or the bank's money. What the fuck are you saying? This isn't an easy call for me to make, it's hard for us too. You know we trust you completely. And I hope none of this is your doing . And I hope the kids are alright . Is that why you called? To throw me under the bus? I've worked for you people for 15 years. I know. And if this is cleared up you'll have our full support again. But please think about , what you're doing . They're your children . A big hug Carlos ,. They don't give a shit about you . Not one shit. Take it easy, Marcos. That means they've discovered , ? what you're doing right R emember, this depends on your... - Can you hear me? - There's no signal. What did you do with the phones?! He'll blow up the car! You hear me? He'll blow up the car! The remote control has been neutralized. Whoever's out there, there's nothing he can do now. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Tell me something. Is this about your brother's financial problems? What the fuck has my brother got to do with all this?! The police spoke to your wife's lawyer. We know you're going through a bad patch. You tapped the phone, didn't you? Have you been listening to this fuck? No, we've heard nothing. You can't tap a line that quickly... and you smashed the radio. I'm sitting with my children on a fucking bomb! Marcos is bleeding. They're my children!! Where are you going? Marquitos, hang in there. These people will get you out of here, you'll see. Here I am, Carlos. I trust you. Now I need you to trust me. Yeah? I want to see if the door's clean. Carlos, I'm going to open the door. Now. Relax, Sara. I want to see if the bomb's similar to the one this morning. The car belonged to Victor Rodriguez, my workmate at the bank. All this for 67,000 euros? He didn't ask for anything else? No, that's all. It's the same kind of bomb. It's home-made. It's what they use in paintball, but with dynamite instead of paint. They're activated when a body presses the hammer and then releases that pressure. You need to understand that you cannot move. Keep seated and nothing will happen. Okay? Oh, God. Almost done, guys. Let's open it up. Do you have any idea who could've done this? No idea at all. Did he say anything that might make you think you know him? No. He knows where I work, he has my cellphone number, and he knows how the bank works. An ex-employee? I can't think of anyone. If it's just for the money in your account, it looks like revenge. Is that possible? Look... Under the seat is a plate that puts pressure on the hammer. We're going to brace the plate. We can get you out of here. It must be someone who knows how to make a bomb. You must have a list of suspects. This is a home-made device. You can buy everything in a hardware store, and unfortunately the instructions are on the Intemet. Even the worst Chemistry student could make it at home. Right. Carlos, give me the cellphone. We'll try to trace the calls. Why don't we give her the phone? I don't want to take any risks. The other phone has a tracking device. Try to grab it. Hide it well. Yes. Anything wrong? e - How's Marcos? - He needs a blood transfusion now. We're going to evacuate him. But I have good news: the dog only detected two bombs under the front seats. Nothing under the back seats. We can take the kids out now. There are wires everywhere. They're just a bluff. Can you really trust a dog? We'll double-check, but it's a bluff. - Guys... - You're staying here? Sara, first we have to get you out, then we'll get your father. Of course. - No. - I'll see you soon, I promise. Carlos, give me the car keys. Marcos, champ! You're going to the hospital. It'll all be fine, you'll see. Dad, why do you want to make the bomb go off? What are you saying? Why do you say that? You said it yourself. No, Marcos. I'd never hurt you. Marcos! Dad, Marcos won't wake up. - Marcos? - He isn't moving... - Marcos, wake up. - Marcos. He's only fainted. - We'll get him out now. - Please take him away. Hawk 1, ready. Sara... Sara, listen. Promise me you'll tell your brother that I would have never harmed any of you. You're going to tell him yourself. Sure, but you tell him too, okay? And tell your mother. Shut up! This isn't the last time we'll ever see each other. Dad, please, no. Please. Sara. - No, no, no. - Sara. No, seriously, let go of me! No, Dad! - We have to get her out. - Let go of me! - Go with her, it'll be fine. - Dad, please! - Sara, come with me. - No! Let go of me! Let go! - Dad, no! - Sara, please! Sara, please. Sara, for God's sake! What are they doing? Put him on the stretcher. Careful. Quick, we have to get him to hospital. Let go of me! Let go! Sara, for God's sake. Please! - Let go of me! - I'm letting go! No, no! What have you done? Let his mother get in. What have you done? I'm not leaving you here, Dad! Sara, what have you done, girl? With me here, they won't dare shoot you. What the hell are you doing? What have you done? What else do you need to see this guy's a nutcase? She saw your men and thought they were going shoot her father! You're blaming me for this? Whether you like it or not, we're still in charge here, so don't give me shit, Espinosa. What's your next move? Now we have a girl on a bomb, and we didn't before. That girl's life is in danger because of that loony. If anything happens to her you will be responsible. Carlos isn't controlling the bombs. What do you base that on? I saw his face. He's a wreck. He's incapable of harming his children. You saw his face? What objective information do you base it on? He's jerked you around enough. The phone he gave you has no unknown incoming calls. Let us follow the protocol. We've found his brother. He's willing to go talk to him and persuade him to give himself up. The bomb's there, it's dangerous. You jammed the frequencies, there's no danger as long as he doesn't move or get up. If he's innocent, as you say, there's no risk, right? Fuck. Mom and Angel got to know each other at school... at the parents' meetings you never go to. I'm telling you in case things go badly for us. Why didn't she say anything to me? About things being bad? Some things you just see. Mom's had a hard time. Maybe they're just friends. We don't know for sure. - Okay, good. - Let's go. Take it easy. Carlos, Carlos, I'm here to help you. Don't do anything crazy. You're a son of a bitch, you know that? It's you. Don't you remember me? Don't you recognize me? Not even now? I don't recognize you. There must be some mistake. For that alone, you deserve to be blown to bits. Pick up the phone. The one I put in your car. Look inside the images file. You remember her, don't you? What do you want from us? I want... I want your father to give me what he took from us. You can't hurt us anymore. There's no phone signal anymore. - Relax. - It's him! What did she say? Carlos, Carlos... Carlos, look. Sara, take that cover off. Take it off, don't be scared. Watch they don't see you. That's it. You have 5 minutes, you hear me? e What the hell do you expect me to do now? They discovered the account I opened. There's nothing I can do. See this button? Watch this. Look at what happens. I want you to drive out of here and continue your transactions. e It can't be done. No, Carlos. Don't beg. My wife begged and you didn't listen to her. Get this car out of here. And say nothing to the police. That isn't possible. Look at that timer and you'll see that everything is possible. Put the cover down. Sara, carefully. - No, Carlos, no! - Hold still! - What are you doing? - Take note. Dad! I'm not letting go of you. If we blow up, you come with us. I'm not responsible for what happened to your wife. Come on, let's go. I have nothing to lose. Do it: One, two... Come on. It's alright, it's okay. Really. I'm not responsible. I'm... I'm just an employee. I was only doing my job. You deceived us. I didn't deceive anyone. I didn't know it was so risky... Even we employees were deceived. You wanted to make money too, that's why you signed. Sure. Get out of there. Get out of there. Please, Carlos. I'm begging you, for your children! Give yourself up! Do it for your children! I'm sorry, he won't do it. I know him, and he won't do it. It's alright. - Are you alright? - Yes. Did he hurt you? - No, I'm fine. - Come on, boys, let's go. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. What happened with that woman? She was a customer. She lost all her money in an investment. And? They took her apartment, debts piled up, she couldn't take it, and she threw herself out of her window. But did you...? Victor and I. Well, I did. Christ, Dad... and you didn't even remember them? Belén, you can't defuse those bombs anymore, so we'll resume command. Do you agree or should we call Madrid? We're missing something. The phone he gave you had no unknown calls. Maybe they communicate another way. Come off it! I saw him grab his girl and stop her from getting out. And before he fainted, the boy said: "Dad, why do you want to make the bomb go off?" And you saw that fight with his brother. It makes no sense. What makes no sense is taking off the suit and endangering lives. That makes no sense. Espinosa! You can't kill a man if you're not sure. No one said we're going to kill him. But we can't let him drive around the center with a bomb and a girl next to him. We're going to do the right thing. Shit. Right... Don't use the narcotic until you're up close. Under no circumstances are the father or daughter to get out of their seats. If the father resists or tries anything, make the signal. Hawk 1 will intervene. Alright, go. We're with you. Let's go. Go, go, go. Let's go. Marta, this is Belén Blasco. What happened? How is my daughter? Sara's fine. It's going well. I know this is a tough time, but I need to talk to you. Are you still there? Marcos is still in danger. He's in intensive care . What do you want? Tell me something. Could Carlos set off a bomb with his children in the car? No, that's not it. Is it his gambling problem? What are you talking about? Your lawyer told us... Carlos has no gambling problem . Angel can't have said that . Did he say that? Hawk 1, do not open fire untiI you get the green light . We're bringing food! I don't want any food! I want to know how my son is! Relax, it's just food. I'm going to approach slowly. Dad, it's started. His brother told us that Carlos has gone crazy. Pablo? You spoke to Pablo? Yes, they told him to go to the car to talk to Carlos and he came back looking disturbed. Pablo's been in Germany for a month. Germany? Marta, is Pablo his only brother? Yes. We have problems with our marriage but Carlos would never, ever do anything bad to the kids or me . I've got to hang up! Put your belt on. He started up the car! Give me the radio! Abort! Arrest the brother. Carlos is innocent! Abort! - Hawk 1, he's all yours! - Abort! Hands up! Push! God damn it! What the fuck happened? Don't try to stop him before I speak to him. Clear the traffic ahead. There's a bomb in the car! I repeat, it has a bomb! Punch it! Get a search on that fucker! I want to know who he is. Now put me through to Carlos. His daughter's got a phone. Go, go! The timer has stopped! Your arm, Dad! Answer it. Hello? It wasn't so hard, you see? My father's hurt. I know how to get the money. He's hurt! Tell him to go to the transatlantic dock. He says we're to go to the transatlantic dock. My father screwed up. I'm sorry. We really are. Nothing can be done to change that! Tell him to go to the dock . Okay, you win. Just let my daughter get out of the car. No one gets out of that car until I get all the money. All the money you took. Sara, tell your father to speed up and ditch the police . You don't have much time to get to the dock. Look at the clock. Look. It's started. 1'40, 1'39, 1'38... - Dad. - Victor, the bank and I pay. My daughter is saved. - Go straight to the dock. - It stopped. And don't talk to the police . Nobody checked the identity of the brother, idiot! Fuck. Maintain positions! Carlos, we've got him. We've got him! Give me the girl's phone. Have you contacted her? Sara, tell your father to get on the phone. Carlos, get on the phone. We've got him, Carlos. Keep it up. Don't move anything. Carlos, get on the phone. Don't lose him. Yes? Alejandro, it's me, Carlos. , ? Carlos are you all right I've just sent a message to the customers with the derivatives and it'll be hard to retrieve them because they know what's going on. , ? What are you saying Carlos They could accuse you of fraud. It was fraud to sell high-risk products without transparency. They'll come for you too. We're all going down. You're crazy, Carlos. They can't prove anything . You're in big trouble. One more thing: you're not the only one who records phone calls. The police do too. Carlos, please, I'm following orders from the top, but... That's it. Tomorrow the bank will be in the papers. That was the deal, the bank, Victor and me. Let my daughter go. Head for the pier . Forward. - So many people, it's dangerous. - Forward. Please keep walking ,, move away from the car. Stop the car. Please keep walking ,, move away from the car. There's a metal plate under your daughter's seat. Keep it pressed and the bomb won't go off. Sara can leave. - What about you, Dad? - Carlos stays here. You can't both get out. - Don't worry. - No. Please... I want my father to come out with me. Sara. I'm not leaving without my Dad. Sara, listen to me. It's all okay. - Clear the people. - Away from the car. It's all okay. You'll be fine. Tell your mom... and Marcos that I love them. I love them more than anything. I did actually know what we were selling. We knew that those investments were a fraud and yet... we sold them. I sold them... I'm sorry. No, no, please. Sara, please. You have to go. No, Dad. Be careful. Now go. Get up, please. Gently, gently. Run. Run, Sara, please. Sara, I can't take any more. Go, please. Go. - Clear the people. - Away from the car. He's released the girl! - Go ahead, go. - Clear the people. Now there's only you and me left. If I don't get my money this will be the end of both of us. - Someone climbed inside the car . - Are you alright? - Son of a bitch. - Look at my hand. Look at my hand. Away from the car! What the hell do you want? My money, I want my money. And I know how to get it. Nobody expects you to go back to the branch. It's closed now. I'll defuse the bomb and we'll both go inside. You'll access the system and transfer the rest of the money to me. It's useless. By now they'll have cancelled my access code. And there's an army of cops behind us. That's enough. That's enough, please. Let's see what they want. Answer it. Carlos... - Yes? - This is Belén. I am sorry we doubted you. I'm sorry, really. ? Is that man Iistening to me now Yes, he is. Lucas... I know your name is Lucas. We know what happened to your wife and I understand why you're so angry. But what you're doing isn't the solution . Right. A nice speech. But you police stiIl work ,, for those who screw us every day. You're a mining engineer. You can defuse the bombs. We know what you want to do. You don't know anything. Someone wants to speak to you. Lucas? This is Ana. The sister's gone in. Please stop this madness ,. She never would've approved of it. I'm sorry, Ana. I have to do something. I need to do it. Think about Pedro. Do it for your son's sake. Please! Believe me, Ana. I'm doing it for my wife, for Pedro, for you, for lots of people... because what they did to us isn't fair. I know I'm asking a lot from you, but... take good care of Pedro. Lucas, no. Take really good care of him. Sara! Honey, are you alright? You don't belong here! - I want to know how my dad is. - Sara. - See to the girl. - I want to know how Marcos is! Please! - Leave her alone. - Dad! I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything we did to you. You're sorry? Now that you're as fucked as I am, right? How does it feel when someone takes everything away from you? Your family, your money, your job... Now you know how it feels, don't you? You were going to kill me anyway, whether I got you the money or not. If I got up every morning these past two years, it was just to get revenge on all of you. But you screwed it all up. All of it. You're right. This doesn't make sense anymore. Everyone on the alert! Water won't stop the explosives. Go! Get out of there! Get away, go! Get away from there, go! Let's go. Come on. Put him there. Come on, Carlos, come on. We're losing him. Come on, fight! We're losing him. Shit, harder. Come on, Carlos, come back. Come on. - Come on, Carlos! - He seems to be coming to. - Keep fighting. - I've got him. Well done. Are you alright? How's my son? He's in the hospital, with Marta. - He's stable. - And Sara? And Sara? Look. Want to get up? Let's go. - Yes? Carlos? This is Mario Contreras . The new managing director at the bank. Listen , I have the difficult task of changing the bank's image after everything that happened... I'd Iike to meet up . Can I ask what for? You fired me... and sued me. Unlike the old management, I appreciate the way you handled the situation . You proved you have initiative . I'd Iike you to come back and join our new team . Right. I know you stiIl haven't found another job, and in view of what happened I dare say it won't be easy, but we want to change, to give other values priority . They're to be Iike family ...
