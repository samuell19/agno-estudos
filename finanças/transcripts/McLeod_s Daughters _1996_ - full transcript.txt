(men goading cattle in unison) (cattle mooing) (horn blaring) Hip, hip, hey, huh! - Patrick, get down here! - Get the stripes! - Shoo, shoo! - [Rod] Ship you off, Patrick! (men goading cattle in unison) Stop blasting the bloody horn! - Get out of here. Shoo! Go on, off! Shoo! (horn blaring) - What the bloody hell do you think you're doing? Eh? - My car broke down. I'm looking for Drovers Run. - Why? - Not that it's any of your bloody business, but I'm looking for Jack McLeod. - [Jack] Why? - He's my father. - Esther? - My name's Tess. - Tess? Tess. You got your mother's hair and my temper. (soaring orchestral music) Grab her baggage. We'll get her settled in. - [Tess] Leave it there. I'm booked into the hotel in town. - It's a long walk. Take Patrick forever to fix that toy. - Then I'll get roadside assistance. - Don't be silly. You're staying here. Rosa, I pay Terry to do that, not his missus. - Yeah, it'll be all right, Mr. McLeod. - Well, it's not right with me. Tess, what are we waiting for? A formal invitation? I'll take that. - Welcome to Drovers Run. - Out of the way. Where is everyone? Meg? Look who's here. Where's Claire? Claire? I've got a surprise for you. - Hi, Tess. - Meg. (laughing) - Stop arguing with me. He's a top class bull. He's worth every penny. Now, that's the end of the subject, all right? Now, who do you think this is? - It's unfair. I'm your sister Tess. (Jack chuckles) And I wouldn't have recognized you either, Claire. - Come on, you can do better than that. - I didn't expect you to still be here. - Why wouldn't I be? It's my home. - [Jack] It's her home too. - Hey, I'm just passing through. In fact, if I can get a lift to the town-- - Now, don't be ridiculous. Put her in the blue room and try and smile. (somber music) - How about I show you to your room? I'm sure you'd like to freshen up. (somber music) That's lovely. - Yeah. - Bathroom's downstairs. - Thanks. I didn't realize my father had married again. - He hasn't. I'm the housekeeper. - Oh. - I came to look after Claire when your mother left him. I've been here so long, I feel like part of the furniture. - Well, he shouldn't have dumped me on you like this. - Well, we're used to Jack's little surprises. (vocalizing over soft music) (child laughing) - It's very old. It was my mother's. - I remember. Claire-- - If gonna have a shower before dinner, can you keep it short? We're not on city water here. (horses galloping) (soaring orchestral music) (horses nickering) - You get 'em all in? - Yup, no worries. - Rod, I'd like you to meet someone. Rod Morgan, our overseer, this is my daughter, Tess McLeod. - Silverman. - What, did you change the birth certificate? - No. - Well, it's McLeod. - Gooday. - Hi. - Now if these two ever set the date, this big fellow will be your brother in law. - Half brother in law. - Which half's that? (Jack laughs) Might have a bit of an explore and chat to you later. - Okay. What's the matter with you? - Can we go and check Stella? I reckon she's ready to fawn. - Whatever you like. - All right. - Thanks. - She's got a couple of days, yeah? - I know. - Any excuse, eh? - What do you think of her? - She's not my cup of tea. - Dad thinks she's Christmas. - Well, he would, wouldn't he? I mean, long lost daughter and all. - She doesn't belong here. - Come on, Claire. She's all right. - She's just like dad, even if she does look like her mother. - Yeah? And you are just like your mother. Quiet, gentle, unbeatable. (laughing) - [Jack] How do you like it, medium or rare? - [Tess] Neither, I'm vegetarian. - Well, we grow very good beef. It might change your mind. Rod, if the two of you would stop (mumbles), you might pour the red wine. - Do you always bully people like this? - Your mother's looks, your mother's spirit. - Her daughter. - You should clean out the Chinese room, Meg. Might invite Ruth up for the Challenge Cup. She always liked the Challenge Cup. - Jack? - Even entered herself in it one year. - If she was still alive, I wouldn't be here. (somber music) - When? - Three weeks ago. Cancer. (somber music) - I'm sorry, Tess. - We were ready. No unfinished business. - You should have told me. - What difference would it have made? - I could have said goodbye. - Dad. - No. I'll go. (somber music) I'm sorry. - Can I bring her back home? - I scattered her ashes at sea. It's what she wanted. - She always liked the water. I should have taken her more often. I should have done a lot of things. Two marriages, better than one gone. But when she went away and she took you with her, I was so alone. - You had Claire. - But I didn't have you. I missed you, Tess. - Then why did you cut me out of your life like I didn't exist? - You think I had a choice? - Yeah. - They're all there. Every letter, every check. She sent them back unopened. - But I thought you hated her. So what happened? - That's our business. - No, I need to know. - Good old Challenge Cup. - Jack? - It's in the past, Tess. Let it be. - And that's it? - I lost the two most important women in my life. I still don't know why. But something's changed. One of them's come back. (glasses clinking) - Only for a couple of days. I'm on my way to Venice. - I think I've got a better idea-- - Meg's put your dinner in the oven. - She's going to Venice, Claire. - That's nice. (somber music) (moves to soaring orchestral music) (horse galloping) - What kept you? - (laughs) Where'd you learn to ride like that? - Riding lessons since I was 12. About the only thing mum and I ever fought over. I won. - You had to. It's in the blood. (cattle mooing) - Good looking specimen, Jack. That's a lot of hamburger. - Well, it was either Crispian or try to bring the stock quality up with artificial insemination. - Well, I bet we'd know which way he'd vote. (Jack chuckles) - We call this spot little mistake. Your mother christened it. Either because this is where I asked her to marry me or because this is where she said yes. I don't know. - You good at forgiving mistakes? Those letters, they change a lot, Jack. I didn't know. - You know now. - Yeah. - Beautiful country, my country. - Yeah. - Race you back. - Hey, wait for me! (laughing) (soaring orchestral music) - What kept you? (laughs) - How was that? - Good. - Tess. - Settle, settle down! (horse whinnies) Oscar, settle down! (horse whinnies) Oscar, Oscar, stop it! Settle down! - What are you, Nod, a girl? - Patrick, he doesn't like-- - Well, he doesn't like anybody and the sooner you learn that, you better off you'll be. - Here, I can do it if you like. Hey, Oscar. (shushing) Oscar, good boy. - I still put my money on the boss and him for the Challenge Cup. - There's gonna be a dance after it this time. - Yeah, you going? - Well, I might. - Pity. I was hoping you'd do the horses for me that night. (horse nickering) (horn blaring) - [Jack] You got a boyfriend? - [Tess] Not at the moment. Why? - [Jack] I need grandchildren. - I'm not stud stock. - They'd come from a pretty good line. - [Tess] (laughs) Boy, have I got some work to do on you. (horn blaring) - Gooday, Jack! (people chattering) - I don't believe you've met my youngest daughter. Tess, this is Clem and Dottie Prendergast who (mumbles) for Drovers Run for 20 years or more, and Becky. - Clem. - I'm very pleased to meet you, Tess. - She'd probably like her hand back when you're finished with it, Clem. - Oh yeah. - And Becky, could do with a fill up. - Oh no, it's all right, Becky. I'll look after that. You take care of Mr. McLeod. - Now, we need some real clothes for Tess, so we need a pair of moleskins and boots, a couple of shirts, and a hat. - [Tess] No, we don't. It's a waste of money. - We can't have you walking around looking like a tourist all the time, can we? - I've got perfectly good clothes. - I'll be at the pub. Whatever she wants, put it on the tab. And Becky, better fix up that muffler. Nearly woke the dead last Sunday morn sneaking out of the jackaroo's quarters. - Wasn't me, Mr. McLeod. - No? Patrick must be sneaking around behind your back. (Dottie chuckles) - So what size are you? No new clothes, right? - No. So you and Patrick? - We're engaged. Gonna announce it at the Challenge Cup dance. Have to hold off on the wedding for a while though 'til he gets married quarters at the Run. - Well, good luck. - I reckon there's a bunch of blokes coming all the way from Boolaroo to ride against you this year. - Well, they won't take the cup back with them, will they? Any more than you lot will. (laughing) (men grumbling in unison) I might have known. What are you drinking? - One of those looks good. - Straight up. Jack. Hello. - Come off it, Steve. We don't need a bank manager in the family. - Ignore him. Tess McLeod. - Steve Creeley. I thought you had come to see me, Jack. - Later. - Good, good, 'cause you can't keep writing those $10,000 checks without approval, you know? - I need the bull. - Yeah, well I need you to bring your overdraft into line. I mean, just before someone at head office gets onto it. You're 15,000 over the limit. - Increase the limit. - Jack. - It would be a shame to ruin a beautiful friendship. - Yeah, well look, you'll have to come and sign for it, eh? - But not today. I'm showing my daughter the sights. - Righto, tomorrow then. It was nice to have met you, Tess. - Well, come on. Roll the tongue back into the head. You'll trip on it. (laughing) I should have asked him for more. ♪ Four man, three man, two man ♪ One man and his dog ♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪ Three men went to mow ♪ Went to mow ♪ Three, three men went to mow ♪ Went to mow I can manage, I can manage. ♪ Went to mow (Jack groans) - Come on. - Bloody stupid idea. - What? - Leaving tomorrow. You'll miss the cup. - I've got a plane to catch. - Well, I'm tired of (mumbles). You belong here. - Come on. You've already got one daughter ready to marry a local stud and give you grandkids. What do you want? - No need to ask where you've been. - It's all right, I drove. - I'll take him. - Claire. Good night. ♪ Five men went to mow - Guess we missed dinner, eh? - It's in the oven. - [Tess] So he got a bit pissed. Is that such a crime? - He's an alcoholic and he has been ever since your mother walked out. - I'm sorry. I didn't know that. - And there is nothing wrong with wanting to have kids and bring them up where they belong. (somber music) - Can't let her go, Meg. - Other foot. - I let Ruth go. I don't want to make the same mistake twice. - [Meg] Are you gonna talk or get some sleep? - I haven't decided yet. (somber music) Don't be cross, Meg. - I'm not. - Thanks. (Jack snores) (animals calling) (vocalizing over soft music) - Gooday. - Hi. - There's something I want to ask you. - I'm a bit busy, Patrick. - There's a dance on after the Challenge Cup. I thought you and I'd go together. - That's a question? - Come on. What do you reckon? - I don't think it'd work, Patrick. - Why not? 'Cause I'm a jackaroo and you're the boss's daughter? I didn't think you'd be the type to give a stuff about that. - No, I'm not, but your little fiance might not be quite so understanding. (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (moves to soaring orchestral music) Morning, Rosa. - Running late today. Bloody animal kicked over the bucket twice. - I'll take it in for you. - Thanks. - See you later. The milk. - Sleep well? - Fine, thanks. - Dad's still asleep. - Morning, Claire. - Corn flakes. - No thanks. Just some straight talk. You've got a problem with me, Claire. I want to know what it is. - Tess. - Did we hate each other as little kids 'cause I certainly don't remember it like that. - No. - Then what? - I just, I don't know what you're doing here. What do you want from us? - Claire, I thought I'd lost all the family I have. - You can't expect instant sisters after 20 years. - I don't, but I thought at least you and I could have been friends. I'm sorry that didn't happen. - I'm sorry too. Maybe we could keep in touch. - Do you like postcards? (vocalizing over soft music) - Drive carefully. - You take care now, okay? - What's this? Are you sneaking out on me? - You were asleep. - You can't go like this. Come on, get out. - Jack, I've got a long drive to take and a plane to catch. - You don't want to go overseas. - Yeah, I do. - You've only just come home. - Jack-- - One of these days, Drovers Run will be yours. Well, half of it. - But I don't want it. That's not why I came here. - The two of you will share it. That's what I've always wanted. Meg, tell her. - Didn't you hear her? She doesn't want it. - She belongs here! She is not leaving! - [Claire] She's got a life. Let her go. - Tess! Tess! (intense orchestral music) Tess! (intense orchestral music) (horse galloping) Hey! (horse whinnying) Tess, get out of the car! Tess! Get out of the car! (horn blaring) (Jack yelling) (horse whinnying) - Dad. Oh god. - Bloody animal. It spooks any. Tess, I can't see. - Oh god. Dad. - Tess. Should have come home earlier. - [Tess] Dad, please. Dad. - Tess. I told you her I always wanted-- - [Tess] Dad, please. - Tess? No, not alone.

I appreciate it. (animals calling) (somber music) - That's the last of them then, eh? - There will a few stays around the back. - Or should we? - No. Let's check on Meg, huh? (shotgun blasting) (birds cawing) - I reckon things will go on pretty much the same. - Yeah, who's gonna run it? - Rod will, you dickhead. - He's already got his holder on Claire. Bloody overseers. Oh, duck's on the pond. - You guys got everything you need? - Yup. (cat yowling) - Bloody pest. (laughing) - What the hell are you doing? - Oh, we're just carrying out Jack's last wishes, aren't we, boys? - He reckoned last week, we had too many damn cats around the place. - Put that bloody thing down. - Sorry? - I said put it down. (cat yowling) (gunshot blasting) - Oh, you got him. (laughing) - Good shot. - You know, the cost of this rifle to what I'm already owed. My wages. I haven't seen a cent for months. - [Male Speaker] None of us have. - If you're owed money, you'll get it. You have my word. - Oh, big deal. - All right. Talk to Claire. She'll sort it out. - If we talk to anybody, we'll be talking to Rod. - He's got nothing to do with this. My father left this property to Claire and to me. - Well, I ain't working for no bloody woman who goes around smashing rifles. - There's the road to town. - You firing me? - You're the one who seems to have the problem. - You're bluffing, aren't you? - Call me on it. - What do you reckon, fellas? We gonna put up with this shit? - If he goes, I'm going too. - Me too. - All of us! - Don't forget to close the gate. - Grow up, Terry! Terry! I am not leaving my house because of Patrick Devlin's stupid pride! - It's a fine thing when his own wife turns on a man! - And it's a fine thing when a man up and quits the very day his boss is put in the ground! (man cheering) - (laughs) Come on, Terry. - You're all fools! And you, you're the biggest fool of the lot of them I'm staying right here. - Come on, Terry. You coming or what? Yes, yeah, that's the way, matey. - Let's get going, eh? - Let's get it out of-- - Come on, mate. That's it. - Come on, get it! - Don't take any of that. (men jeering) (engine rumbling) - It's okay. He'll come back. He always does. - Yeah, I know, love, I know. - Hey Rod, when you've sorted out that city bitch, you'll know where to find us. (Patrick laughs) Yeah, you can sack us, eh? - Do you want a glass? - I don't even like scotch. I shouldn't have come here, Meg. I've caused nothing but trouble. - Claire's jealous, love. All her life, all she ever wanted was her father's approval. 25 years, she worked for it. And then you come along and within two minutes, Jack's eating out of the palm of your hand. You got to help her. - I lost my temper. It's none of my business what you do. Do what you like. Employ who you like. I shouldn't have sacked them. - Well actually, you saved me the effort. I want to hire these blokes from Boolaroo and they'd have to be an improvement on Terry and Patrick, wouldn't they? These blokes already got jobs, so I'm gonna have to convince them to come over. - But don't we owe money? - Don't worry about it. I'll speak to the bank. - Just like Jack. One word to the bank over a beer and suddenly he's $10,000 richer. - That's the way we do it out here. - I wasn't criticizing. - Yes, you were. - I'll go. - No, I've got to talk to her. (somber music) I know you don't want me here, Claire. Just let me stay here and fix this mess I've made, please. - There's no need. Rod's-- - Handling it? Yes, I know. Are you happy with that? - He's our overseer. - He doesn't know everything. He's set in his ways. He can't see past borrowing more money from the bank. - Why shouldn't we? - All right. What's your current bank debt? Our debt? I guess I've got half of that too. - I heard about last night's dust up. So they've all walked, have they? - Not exactly. - Could we see those figures? - Yeah. Look, it's not good. Jack was in pretty deep. - So what's the bottom line? - Well. - Tess. - Shit, it's national bloody debt. And you lent him more money last week? - Yeah, I'll look. I extended his mortgage honeymoon well over six months ago. Now, I'm not sure that he was aware that it was gonna snowball like this. - And this is compounding? - Jack was gonna clear it with his next sale. - Don't worry about it, Steve. Just give us the necessary information and we'll sort something out with Rod. - I got the file, didn't I? Okay, smartypants. What are we gonna do about the interest payment? - Sell the stock like Jack planned, of course. - Great. To sell them, we have to muster them. You sacked the men, remember? - Okay. I'll go and grovel to the barbarians, beg them to stay. Is that gonna satisfy you? - No. Rod said he doesn't want them back. - Claire, we can't wait for Rod. - Claire. We had a chat and well, we want to come back and work for you, but we need the cash, and only if Rod's gonna be running the place. - Frieda, can you put the word around for us? There's work at Drovers Run for anyone who's willing to put their back into it. Only qualifications are willingness to work and some vaguely 20th century attitudes. - I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you. - I'll be too busy working. - That's it. Looks like Queensland then. - You're leaving town? - Yeah, I'll talk to you later about that, Beck, all right? - Patrick, what about me? What about us? - What about us? - Well, everything we've got planned, you know? Like getting married and getting a place of our own. - Are you gonna pay for it with what you earn, Beck? Listen, you're a sweet kid, okay? And I really like you, but it's over, all right? - You said you loved me. - Come on, Beck. Could you really see me with a half dozen kids hanging off my shirt? And I wouldn't even know if they was mine now, would I? Eh? - You used me? - And you didn't use me to get out of here? You knew what you were doing, Beck. End of story. (mumbles) - [Becky] Bastard! - Oh now, look at that, eh? Over me already. You see that, Nod? That's the way you do it. (Patrick laughs) - We can't earn that much. - Your father said a few good years would get us out of it. Don't worry. - Worry? He even owed Meg. - There's nothing to spend wages on around here. - I'm sorry, Meg. We'll just work something out with Steve. - Good solution. We'll borrow more money. - Well, it's better than your solution. Nobody in this district's gonna work here, not with Patrick and Terry stirring up trouble. - Well, we can both ride, can't we? Why can't we muster the cattle ourselves? - We need Rod. Once he's got the new men, he'll have them mustered in no time. - And meanwhile, we just sit around and watch the place go down the (mumbles). - Don't be stupid. - Don't patronize me. - [Meg] Girls. - Two women cannot possibly muster that many cattle on their own. - How about three women? You said there was work here. (mumbles) wages? - Me? - Well, you've been doing your dad's work for years. Why not get paid for a change? - Yeah, well, Mr. McLeod never took me seriously. - I do. You'd have seniority in the staff of two. - Three. I like my place. I like Drovers Run. I've worked hard keeping Terry going for years. Now, I work hard for myself. (laughing) (soaring orchestral music) - Wait for me! - Oh, my hat! - Don't be stubborn, Claire. Everyone else is coming. - This is silly. Just wait for Rod. - We need you. Come on. What do we know about mustering, hm? - Then don't do it. - [Meg] Tess, it's Jack's. He would have liked you to have had it. - Thanks, Meg. Let's go! (soaring orchestral music) - Which way? - Come on. - Come on, mum! - Hey, you guys, wait for me! - Oh, hurry up! - [Jodi] Patrick will be pretty shitty you're taking his job. - [Becky] Yeah, well Patrick can go jump, him and his little shadow. - [Jodi] Noddy's okay. - [Becky] They call him Noddy and Biggies around the pub. - I don't get to the pub much. I'm not much good with blokes. - You're lucky. Being good with blokes never got me anything but trouble. - Come on, you two! Get over here! - Come on! (sucking teeth) Come on! - Hey, wait up! (whimsical orchestral music) - Hey, shoo! - [Female Speaker] Drive 'em down! - [Female Speaker] Hey! - [Female Speaker] Hey, come around the back! - [Female Speaker] Come on! - [Female Speaker] He's getting away! - [Female Speaker] Hey! - Go on! - [Female Speaker] Come on! - [Female Speaker] Drive them through. - [Female Speaker] (mumbles) on the back! - Come on! - They're getting away! - Move it! - Hey! - Oi! Come on! - [Female Speaker] Oi! Up, up! Up! - Got it? - I'm getting it! - [Tess] Push them too fast, they slide. - Come on! - Get down! - [Female Speaker] This isn't working! - Hey! - Come on! (women goading cattle in unison) - Shoo, shoo! - [Female Speaker] They're not moving! - [Female Speaker] Get down! - [Jodi] What now? - We're not gonna make it back to the main yards by night, are we? - What, leave them here? - No, they'll scatter all over the paddock. - What would Claire do? - She'd ask Rod. - What would Rod do? - Rod would use hot tape. - Fine. What's hot tape? - This'll do it. Puts a mild electric charge through it. - Amazing. - Yeah, men use it all the time. Terry reckons they tell the new chums that if they piss on it, they'll see a pretty rainbow. - Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. - Ow! - Idiot. - See? I told you. - Bloody amateurs. Yeehaw! (laughing) (men goading cattle in unison) Get in there, come! (laughing) That's the way it's done. Yeah, come on! - Let's go, go! - Come on! - I'm coming! Yeah, yeah, come on! (laughing) (horses galloping) - Tess, I could have sworn I got it right. - You did, Jod. I felt it. - Look, it can't be helped, but if they're all out there again, we better get started. At least we're one paddock closer to home. - [Meg] Wouldn't hurt you to help. - Or you. - Well, you'd be more use, but if one more inexperienced woman on horseback can help, I'll give it a go. - Meg. Meg, Rod's back. - What's this I hear about women mustering? - It's Tess. She wouldn't wait. Did you get the men? - Yeah, no worries. I got three blokes starting at the end of the month. - But that's too late for the sale. - Yeah, well, we'll yard them for next month's sale. Don't worry about it. - Do you have any idea how much money we owe? - What's gotten into you? You're starting to sound like your crazy bloody sister. - Well, at least she's out there and she's trying! - Look, I'm fair buggered love. How about making us a cup of tea? Don't feel much like arguing. - Make it yourself. (horse nickering) (piano music) ♪ Under my thumb ♪ And into my heart - Hip, hip, hip! Hey, Becky. Come on, come on! Get up, get up! Up! Move it!

I didn't think I'd live to tell the tale. - Hi, Rod. - Hi. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Harder than it looks. You gonna join us, Rod? - Cheers. - I can't believe how sore I am. - You think you're sore? - Do you want something to eat? - Is there any more beer in the fridge, Meg? - So how are you gonna get 'em to the selling yards? - By truck. We don't have a truck? They're in the yards ready to go. - Pick 'em up in the morning. That'll be cash on the barrelhead though, love. - Don't you usually bill us after the sale? - Usually yeah, but we haven't been paid from the last lot from the Run yet. - But didn't Jack run a tab? - Jack did, yeah, but Jack was Jack. Sorry love, it's cash or nothing. - You're a mean man, Clem Prendergast. - You know they won't cooperate. - She thinks running a cattle station's so bloody easy, you let her find out the hard way. - She's only trying to help. - Well, you've changed your tune. - Well, we all want the same thing, what's best for Drovers Run. - Shit, Claire. We've never even had a fight before she turned up. - Who's fighting? We need you, Rod. I mean obviously, we can't do this alone. - All right, I'll give them a call and I'll see what I can do. All right? - He's not coming. - He'll come. - This is silly, Beck. - Jod. - Well, if it isn't Calamity Jane and Annie Oakley, eh? I thought you girls would be out mustering. - The stock are in and drafted. - Oh really? How'd you manage that? Ask them nicely and threaten to cry if they didn't follow you? Oh, that's not the sort of riding you'd be used to, Beck. - No, this time, I actually enjoyed it. - You little smart ass. - Look, leave her alone. - Who's gonna make me? Someone who can't even wind up hot tape right? So what? (mumbles) (laughing) Nice shot, Jod! Get him a beer. - Come on, I'll buy you a drink. - Not in there. - Why not? - Well-- - Tess McLeod, I just wanted to shake your hand. - Makes a change. - None of those bastards in there want to admit that you girls pulled off a great job, but Neville Grady's a man to give credit where credit's due. Can I buy you a drink? (workers goading cattle in unison) - So, next stop Burley sale yards. - What the hell are you doing here? - Boss here just hired herself a new stock and station agent. All the best. Be in touch. - Thanks Neville. - Okay. - Clem Prendergast has been Jack's agent for 20 years. - He's an obstructive old fart. - That does not mean you can dump him for some slimy bastard like Neville Grady. - He's arranged cartage to the sale which is more than Clem would do. - Clem will for me. - Yeah, well, you're too late, Rod. - Do you expect me to stand around and watch this place run into the ground by some woman who doesn't even know she's being had? Either Neville Grady goes or I do. - Don't do this to me. I'm not gonna be a rope in a tug of war between you two. - Well? - It's your choice, Rod. - Is this what you want? You've lost that then. (Claire sighs) - She could have asked him to stay. - What is it with those two? Does she really love him? - They've got a great deal in common. He's a good man. - He's right about Neville Grady. When's dinner? - He's staying with Steve Creeley. I thought I saw him take his bag in. - [Claire] I'll go and find him, ask him to come back if that's what you want, Claire. - Don't bother. Rod loves this place. He won't be able to stay away. - Well, at least we've sold the stock. A nice big fat check should make us all feel much better. - [Tess] Did we send any bulls to sale? - Only one scrubber. - Look at this. There's two bulls on this manifest and Crispian's missing. - Look, I don't know how this happened, but you seem to have taken our stud bull by mistake. - I thought you were just culling duds. - We gave you one scrubber, Neville. - No, two. I thought it was a bit strange at first. It was quite a big bloke though. - Rubbish. I'd have seen Crispian. - The manifest says two bulls. Sorry, girls. - Why don't you just get us the buyer's details, Neville? We're gonna have to call them, explain what's happened, and buy him back. - It may not be quite that easy. That lot went straight to the abattoir and over the hook. All you'll be buying back is a ton of steaks. - All we're asking is for you to roll over the arrangements you have with our father. You didn't think this was a problem last time we saw you. - Yes, but last time, Rod was handling things, wasn't he? Now, I understand that he's left. - Oh, you know he has, Steve, unless that's the abominable snowman sleeping in your spare room! - From the size of this check, his reservations about Neville Grady were pretty well based. - It was a poor sale. - Claire, it's your best in 18 months. - Look, how much do we need to get you off our backs, Steve? We can sell some of the antiques, Claire. They've got to be worth a fortune. - Look, you're only gonna stave off the inevitable anyway. I mean, you've already lost your workforce. You've lost your overseer, your prized bull. You can't even meet your interest payments. Now look, I'm sorry, but I got a responsibility to my shareholders. I'm just gonna have to report the whole situation to head office. - Whichever way I add it up, it's still too much money. I really wanted to fix this up for you, Claire. - Come on, we're not dead yet. - Once I'm gone, Steve will be happy. Rod will come back and you two can fix everything up. - On whose terms? - I thought you wanted to marry Rod. - What I want is to get this property out of debt and back into the sort of place our father would have been proud of. - Yeah, but how? - By not giving up until we have to. It's gonna take Steve Creeley a couple of weeks to put that paperwork through. We've got that long. That's if you're willing to stick around 'til then. - Yeah, of course I am. - Good. (horses galloping) (sentimental music) (horse whinnying) - [Jodi] Oscar, you're going to get yourself into terrible trouble. - [Tess] Hey, Oscar. How you doing? - He followed us in. - Hey. - I want him back out in the morning. We need to talk as soon as you're finished. And we'll need everyone if we're gonna have any chance at all. - And your pay packets will be pretty thin. In fact, they'd be empty. - If we don't pull it off, we don't know how long it's gonna take us to pay you. So if anyone wants out, we understand. - Well, we won't see a penny if we quit now. What do you reckon? - To us. - Thank you. - To us. - All of you. - Ladies. You got a minute? I thought you might want to talk to me, that's all. - About what? - You saw Steve Creeley, didn't you? - And they say the (mumbles) brigade gossips. - Damn it, Claire, I miss this place. I miss you. - Interesting order. - Oh come on, you know what I mean. I lost my head yesterday. It was childish, I know, but nothing's changed. I know you're upset with Jack dying and Tess coming back and stirring things up, but I swear, in a few years, we'll sit out here with the kids and we will laugh about this. - Do you love me, Rod? - You know how I feel. - You never said it once. - I was pretty happy with the way things were shaping up. - It's all a question of footsteps, isn't it? You step into Jack's, I step into yours. - It's not a bad life. - What if I want to walk side by side, huh? Or even out in front? - I just want things back the way they were, that's all. - Oh Rod. (somber music) - Rod not staying for tea? - No, he had to get back. - How is he? - Have you ever been in love? - About twice a week 'til I was 15. Not quite so often after. - Sensible. - Meg? - Yes. - How did it feel? - Wonderful and terrible. Time gets out of phase. You sing unexpectedly, and your heart freezes, and you think you'll never breathe again. And then he's gone. You're left with just a memory, but it's a good memory. Worth it. - For you. - Thanks, Dottie. - About time someone showed these blokes they're not having things all their own way, but him, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. - Well, he certainly messed up our stock sale. - Done all right for himself though, taking over the lease on Fuller Downs. Got himself some cheap stock and a bull and even taken on an overseer. - Bastard, damn him! Undersells our stocks to put on his own place and steals our stud bull. - Well, he can't get away with it, can he? - Yeah, well it might be hard, especially if Patrick's done a good job with the brand. - I'll tell you what. Next time we sell stock, we're cutting out the middle man. No more crooked agents. - They're not all crooked. - Why can't we just sell the stock in our yards? That way, if we don't get the price we want, we can just send the buyers home. - Actually, that's not such a bad idea, but more importantly, how are we gonna get Crispian back? - We can't just leave him there. - We could steal him back. - Hang on. What if scumbag Grady and his cowboy sidekick had urgent business elsewhere? - [Becky] Like where? - [Tess] Like here. (horn blaring) (soaring orchestral music) - Hey! You gotta come and have a look at this! Come on! (laughs) That's the Challenge Cup! - Sure is, and it's yours if you can take it off us. - Next Saturday at Drovers Run, we'll be holding the Challenge Cup. It will be a little different this year. The women of Drovers Run will take on whoever you blokes care to put up against us. - Oh, what sort of a challenge is that? - It's tougher than you think. - And it'll be followed by a stock sale in our yards. - Now, what makes you Sheilas think we're gonna be part of this joke? - If you're frightened of being beaten by a bunch of girls, Patrick, don't bother coming. (laughing) - We'll see you all on Saturday. - [Terry] Aw yeah, you'll see us all! (laughing) - Saturday, eh? - [Terry] Yeah, it wouldn't matter what bloody day of the week it was. - You're not riding in the cup, I hope. - Hey, Rod. Frightened you'll get beaten? - Don't be ridiculous. - [Claire] Well? - All right. - I'm in. (people chattering) (soaring orchestral music) - Hey, there you are. Been looking for you everywhere. They've finished assessing the stock. Pub's giving us the beer on credit. Radio station's come through with a few free ads and the computer link up is in place. Now, all we need is a good crowd tomorrow. - Yeah. - Hey, you're not scared, are you? - I'm just wondering what dad would have made of all this. - I reckon he'd be in his element. - I miss him, Tess. If only. - Things were different? Claire, I'm only here to try and sort out this mess I made. Once that's done-- - You'll be off to Venice. Who can blame you? I know half your luck. I know. (Claire sighs) (soaring orchestral music) - Let's go. - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the annual running of the Challenge Cup. A bit late this year and a bit different and I wouldn't mind betting that the most interested spectator out here today is old Jack McLeod, wherever he is. (audience applauding) 'Cause this year, it's the women from the Run against-- - Have you been eating your greens, Terry Wilcox? - I haven't had a decent feed since I left, love. - I got quite used to not cooking. - [Clem] Is against the law, so it's a very good thing there isn't a man standing up for the shearing chair, if you know what I mean. - They might as well hand the cup over now, eh? - In your dreams. (laughing) - Where's Neville? - I reckon he'd be up there running the book. - Women of the Run. - Five to one. Sorry to take your money, Dottie. - Hey, Dottie, got a minute? (engine rumbling) Drive carefully, Dottie. - Ladies and gentlemen and kiddies, of course, I've been asked to remind you that tickets for the wool shed dance after the race can still be purchased from the beer tent. And if you don't know there that is, just find Terry Wilcox and follow him. By my reckoning, we should be starting in about 10 minutes, so I suggest that all the riders get a bit of a wriggle on. Thank you. - Hey, Clem. Won't you be needing your truck after the sale? - Yes, Terry, that's why it's parked down by the yard. - I thought I just saw your missus heading off up the track. - Go and have another beer, Terry. Dottie'd never touch my truck. ♪ Neville Grady had a farm ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ And on that farm he had a bull ♪ (laughing) - Would it be so dreadful if we won? - It is not a question of that. I just want things to settle down. - We have to go through with this now, Rod, we've gone too far. - Well, you won't get far on her. You're gonna have to ride Oscar to keep up with my old bloke. - No one rides Oscar anymore. - What if he's right? - You're starting to sound like me. - So what are our chances? - I'd say next to nil. - If I ride Oscar? - Much better. You can see how Claire feels about him. - How's she gonna feel if we lose? - Tess. - I want you to find Becky. This is five grand. Get her to put it on us and then I want you to bring Oscar. (audience applauding) - Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentleman, please! This is the big one, the one you've all been waiting for, the free for all. And riding for the women, we've got Tess and Claire McLeod and Jodie Wilcox! (audience applauding) Can't see you, Jodi. Where are you, love? We're waiting. Running for the men, we've got Rod Morgan and Patrick Devlin and Noddy Barlow! Come on, Jodi. Move your butt. Move yourself, Jodi, love, we're still waiting. That's a girl. - Clem, hold the start. There's been a mistake. - No, there hasn't. - Tess, please. - Clem? - [Clem] Right. - You bet against your own team? - What do we need more, the cup or the money? - Well, you better go and tell them. - Well, it's too late now. - Get set, go! - [Male Speaker] Get going, girls! Come on, girls, you can do it! (audience cheering) - Go, Run! (audience cheering) - [Female Speaker] Go, Run! - Get down. I'm not losing you too! - [Male Speaker] That's it, eh. Good boy. - Get on! Hurry! Come on, come on! (audience cheering) (whimsical orchestral music) That's it! Come on! - Go Tara, come on! Come on! - Oh, Jenny! - Come on, get up! - Yeah, yeah! Go on, get up, Sammy! Yeah! (whimsical orchestral music) Come on. - Come on! - [Male Speaker] Get up! - Come on, boy! - Go, go, go, come on! Come on! - [Tess] Come on, get up! - [Male Speaker] Come on, come on! (men grunting) - Yeah, yeah! (horn blaring) - Hold on, Claire! - Hang on, Claire, we're coming! - Come on, come on! - Get up, get up, come on. - Come on, buddy. We've got a race to win! - Just hold on! Whoa, whoa. - Hold it! - [Rod] Whoa, whoa. - We didn't win. - Here they come! (audience cheering) - Pay up. - Your lot's through that race. - You took the money, you pay up. - No way. The whole thing was rigged. - No it wasn't. My horse bolted. - Oh yeah, a likely story, and I suppose her horse bolted too. - I went to help. - So did I. How do you explain that? - How do you explain that she put five grand on the blokes just before the race started? - She did? Oh Becky! - What! - How much did we win? - Enough! I got the bet on before they realized they were riding against Oscar. (squealing) - Dottie. Come have a look. (cattle mooing) - Come on. - Hey, where'd you get that bull? - Found him on the road, Neville, just standing there. - You stole him from Fuller Downs, you mean. - He looks just like Crispian, doesn't he, Dottie? Isn't that strange? Back from the dead. - He's my bull. - No, that's Crispian. Not another bull like him in the district. - So what do you think he'd be doing down in Fuller Downs then? - We could always get Sergeant Foster to sort this out. - [Becky] Hey. - Look, I'll owe you, okay? - No, that's not good enough. - Ladies and gentlemen and you blokes who beat us fair and square, Challenge Cup is yours. (audience cheering) But that's not why you're here really, is it? The main event of the day is coming up very shortly. The inaugural Drovers Run on site cattle sale. So grab your beers and head on over. And don't forget your wallets. (audience applauding) - I've got a magnificent line up for you today of cattle there. 665, 70, 575. - 575? - Where's that 600? (auctioneers speaking in unison) And then they'll give us a lot of those (mumbles) there. - Congratulations. I thought you might need these. - Thanks, Steve. - We never seen anything like it, eh? - No, no. Certainly think you proved your point. - Well, you'll have your interest check in the morning, Steve. - Yeah, well I wouldn't be too hasty about that, Tess. I'm sure that head office will be happy to reassess the whole situation. - Thanks, Steve. We'll think about it. (laughing) - See you, mate. - So you'll be off to Venice then, eh? - Yeah, well soon as I've got everything organized, but you know what, I reckon you two are gonna do just fine with Drovers Run. - [Auctioneer] 560, 565, 70, 575! - So had to lose the battle and win the war, eh? (somber music) Come on, cheer up. All you lost was the Challenge Cup. - No McLeod has ever lost that cup. - Yeah, well I won it. - Yeah, well anyone can win a race when you're the only one running. - Yeah, she's right. Besides, it's staying the district. You're not. You got my drift? (somber music) - Gooday. Need a hand? - Thanks. - You did pretty good out there. - We didn't win. - It didn't matter. You want to go to the dance later? (horse nickering) (engine rumbling) (sentimental orchestral music) - Thank you, but your team won it. - It doesn't matter. This is where it belongs. I love you. - You ever felt your heart freeze 'til you thought you'd never breathe again? Felt time stand still? Marrying was an easy way for us to get what we both wanted. I think we care more for this place than we do for each other. - She's really got to you, hasn't she? - Don't blame Tess. It's me who's changed. Isn't it better we find out now than after I've made you miserable for a few years? - We'd have made a go of it though. - Only we're both worth more than that. (Claire sighs) (laughing) - Well, when's he coming back? - He's not. - Is that good or bad? - My choice. You know, whatever it was that we felt for each other, it wasn't the grand passion. You know, I guess I'll deal with that when and if it comes along. I'll probably be too busy running this place without an overseer to ever notice it. - You'll be fine. - So when do you fly out? - I know when I've got a few things organized. - Like the money for a new ticket? The only way you could have made that $5,000 bet was to cash your ticket, right? Here it is. I mean, if you still want it. - Are you-- - Our father was so right. You belong here. I would really like for you to stay. (sobbing) Hey, hey, come on. Come on, little sister. We've got some work to do, eh, eh? Come on!
