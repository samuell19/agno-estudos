No one can be in my brain instead of me. There is only me inside of me. I will need to remember... ...myself as I am now. Otherwise... Otherwise... Where will I have gone? Ah! It's working. That's good. Will you use the mic? Probably. Thank you. Go ahead. Hello...Hello. Keep going. I... I have been in your place, on these seats. A long time ago I could almost as a preamble claim for myself the enigmatic sentence from Nicolas Poussin's painting. "Et in Arcadia ego", whose most common translation is "I too, have been in Arcadia". Arcadia, the ultimate idyllic land. Don't stop on my account. [Students speak Breton] [Students speak Breton] Madam? - Your notebook. - Thank you. [Students speak Breton] Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. [Students resume speaking Breton] "Salle de la cité. December 1981." "I hope to see you soon, Françoise." "I'm working at the library. Stéphane Nédellec." Who are you? And you? And you? Who were you? Ok, I'll tell you where I am. I rented an apartment. The hotel wasn't good enough? Well, I saw a sign and called the number. I find this completely stupid. What's stupid? To pay rent for only one or two nights a week. I'm planning to spend more time here. But I'll be coming home every weekend. And your analysis? - I knew you were going to ask. - Well, of course I am. If you could see how gigantic the trees are. They used to look pitiful. It looks like they're going to top the buildings. Typical. The move into action from the Bretons running away from their analysis is not getting pregnant or having a stupid accident but to return to Brittany. They begin by discovering that their unconscious speaks more or less Breton. And I do say "more or less" and pretty soon, the analysis doesn't exist anymore. The deadly obsession with Montparnasse Station has already begun. Earlier, on the campus there was a group of students talking Breton. There it is! Here we are... or rather, you are. Don't start saying "there it is!"... You could ask questions instead of always knowing everything in advance. I don't need to. I can picture you very well, my dear. Go ahead, I'm listening. You're almost naked. That's an easy one. It's so hot right now. - Keep going - I'm focusing. You're walking towards... ...a mirror. How did you guess? You'll come to see me? You know very well that since I've started receiving on Saturdays, I don't leave Paris. How convenient for you... Yes. Françoise? Françoise? Hi! Is it the right place for the second-year geography seminar? Yeah, it's right up there. And you're taking geography too? Yeah, definitely...yeah. And we need to wait outside or...? Where are you from? I was harvesting grapes near Nantes. No, I meant last year. Lydie! Hi Lydie! How is it going? - How are you? - Good, and you? - Yeah - Hey, it's been a while! - Hi. - Hi. Come, Lydie. So, I'm going to hand you stereoscopes. There are not enough for everyone so I'll ask you to form groups of 2 or 3. Can I form a group with you? - Are you new here? - Yeah. So, you'll start by determining the common territory between the pictures knowing that stereoscopy is possible only for 60% of each picture. You place one on top of the other like that and then you position the stereoscope on top. Looking for the correct width and by choosing beforehand a similarity within the two pictures. Do you see anything? A forest, blurry. I'll move them. You'll tell me when to stop. Ah! Don't move! - Ah, it's so good! - Take turns. Can you see the relief? Yeah. It's beautiful. On the rhodoïd, please delimit the essences. The conifers...which are conic. The geographical areas, thickets, etc. By applying... - And there, these are larch trees. He didn't say anything about larch trees. But...these are clearly larch trees. How do you they're larch trees? That's because of the family I used to live with. They were park-keepers. Your family? No, a family I used to live with. They looked after the park of a ruined castle and city hall had turned it into an arboretum. And the tree behind the window, how is it called? I can always hear it rustle. That's a willow. A Chinese willow. And you, what's your name? Lydie. There was also this one. Oh yes. Thank you. Hello, Françoise. Hello Did you get my letter? Stéphane! Thank you for the picture. I really enjoyed it. Do you have time for a cup of coffee? Not now, my first lecture starts in 20 minutes and I need to do some photocopies from this book. You'd be better in my office. I would have recognized you anywhere. You haven't changed. Do you believe we stay the same person all of our life? "Time is a kid who plays marbles". You were the one who found that translation. Do you remember? We all loved Heraclitus at the time. Hmm It might be the only thing that hasn't changed. I'm telling you now, the great Catherine really wants to throw a dinner for you. I'm warning you, everybody will be there. John Le Scieller, Sylvie Blonde, Serge Horizon, the two Philippe, Anita from the Dead Flowers, the little Claire, and maybe even her sister. Rémi, if he's back from Madagascar. And that girl who called herself the Cosmonaut. Viviane... Marion. You're describing an amnesia, Françoise. - An amnesia? - An amnesia, yes. Either there is cerebral damage, a trauma or a massive repression of the hysterical kind. Everything is always clinical with you. Forgetting things doesn't necessarily mean it's an amnesia. Except that meanwhile, the unconscious remembers everything. He's the only one. [Man speaks Breton] Excuse me. Can I trouble you for a light? Yes Thank you. You stop your analysis, then you discover you're amnesic. What will the third stage be? I don't know, maybe you'll kill a sphinx How many of your exes will be at that dinner? There it is! That's all you care about? It was to test your memory. If there's one thing I remember, it's that at the time, no one had a phone. We met like that, in the street or at the cafe. You've always had this religion of chance. Yours is no better, the religion of rendez-vous. It works better to meet people. It depends what one calls "meet". Why am I am so afraid, every time, at the start of first term? All these faces who listen or who don't listen. Most of which, I will never meet. You'll see Once you'll be in the dark with them and an Italian landscape... hmm, yes. Everything will be fine. Good morning. Good morning I am really touched to be here. I was once on those very seats when I was a student in Rennes. I had not returned, except for a symposium last year. I could almost, as a preamble identify myself with the enigmatic epitaph from Nicolas Poussin's painting. With which we will begin. "Et in Arcadia ego." whose most common translation is I too, was in Arcadia" Arcadia! This Greek land, neighbor to Sparta, which was turned into the metaphor for all earthly paradises. Why not this campus? And that eternal youth. Do you want me to carry you on my shoulders? Why? That way, you won't have to hold my hand. - Does it bother you, my cane? - No. Please, I really want to carry you. If you put me on your shoulders, you'll realize I'm not wearing any panties. I knew it! Who'd be stupid enough to wear underwear with that late June heat? Come on, please! Can I carry you? - How? - Look. I'll get down. You put your foot here, you put your weight on here. Wait. Wait. Go ahead. Careful. Are you ok? Yes! But what... I can't see anything. It feels like we're one body. Don't move. I didn't move. You did, a little. When you know I'm in the room, not far from you how do you know? Do you hear me or is it my scent? My aura? Do you believe in the aura, Ion? I believe in everything. The aura must fill roughly the same space as the scent. Maybe the scent is the molecular version of the aura. You smell of honey. Or oysters. And you of chestnut flower. Finish your exercise for next week. Thank you! I received several phone calls from someone who would like to see you again, and who claims to be your mother. You stated on your information sheet that your father was unknown and also that your mother had passed away. Can you confirm she has passed away? We consider she has passed away. What do you mean, you "consider"? A person is either living or dead. That's beyond any consideration. Do you have a legal guardian? I've been of age for a year. I was in foster care on weekends, but they've gone into a retirement home. And Nicole Martin, your emergency contact? She's the winegrower I've worked for the last couple of years. Does she know you're putting her name down? If I need an amputation or a face transplant, she'll know what to do. And your mother? There's a woman claiming to be my mother, but she's not. Listen Ion, you're an adult. If this person calls again, I'll tell her you don't wish to be in touch with her. Alright? Listen, you're pissing me off! You're all pissing me off! I've had enough, ok?! Call me back! Call me back, ok? Françoise? Stéphane didn't tell you? I cancelled the dinner. Come in. Take your coat off, sit down. Here, I brought a bottle of Hautes-Côte-de-Nuits. Very nice, we'll open it. Take your coat off, sit down. That idea of a reunion dinner with everybody... ...well, it was my idea. Just the two of us like that, it's nice. What was that? - Is that the wind shaking the building? - Yes. You get used to it. Most people can't. They move out because of this shaking. Me, I like it. I feel like I'm living on a branch. To our lovers. May they show themselves one day. Is something wrong, Catherine? Everything was fine until I learned you were in Rennes. Tell me, why did you come back? There was a tenure position available at the University. So I applied. You want me to believe you left a Parisian university to come back to Rennes? I couldn't stand Paris anymore, I was suffocating. Or rather, I was scratching myself. I had eczema for years on my hands but as soon as I'd leave Paris for a symposium or anything... ...the eczema would vanish. Let me see. It's gone. Well, you've always been like that, the nice girl who goes to the parties and the most hardcore concerts but even after an all-nighter, right on time at the lecture hall! What did you like? Like a spectator! The girl who stays on the sidelines, who watches others get hammered, but who doesn't dive. She plays pinball, her neck really straight. She throws her balls into the future... Catherine... The difference between you and us was that WE hated life! And I loved it? You adored it. You didn't even realize it. No need to take drugs or to cut your wrists, you didn't even need to play music! Alright, I loved life. - Were you at the concert? - James White? It was at L'Espace. Comfort Yourself! - Good evening. - Good evening. Cours Kennedy, please. In Villejean. - By the canal? - Yes, by the canal. To the right of the river is Hell. And to the left, Paradise. So, this river can't the Styx... which separates the world of the living from that of the dead. It would likely be the Cocytus... flowing from the Acheron... And here, flowing in the opposite direction would be... the Phlegethon... Also flowing from the Acheron. It's of course absurd on a hydrographic map. But until the 17th century, it was believed that the earth hid in its depths an intense network of underground streams and rivers which drained it similar to the vascular system in the human body. Charon, the oversized ferryman, escorts a pale frail being. It's a human soul, that seems tempted by Hell. More so than by the call of this angel, here. Why? Because the soul sees something else than us, who look at the painting. From its point of view, Hell offers a welcoming shore. Cerberus lies low. A pleasant meadow precedes a charming thicket. Whereas Paradise is surrounded by reefs. We can only reach with difficulty through the rocks and the swamps indicated by the reeds there. Delicate and passive like a sick child, the soul seems to be on a stroll. The right hand solemnly placed on the side. Are you alright? Maybe we should take him into the nurse's office. He says he wants to see the end of the lecture. - Pardon me? - He says he wants to see the end of the lecture! We are going to talk about the Lethe, the river of Oblivion which heals every ill when one drinks its water. We ate downtown with the two Philippe. I didn't tell you, but everyone freaked out about this dinner. The two Phillipe think that the great Catherine is crazy. It appears that she's had several stays in psychiatric hospitals. Well, these things happen... She's obsessed with all the dead. Everyone in our past who has died. She's even made a map of the graveyards of Rennes and of every plot. Did she give it to you? Must the email she sent me this morning. I heard that John Le Scieller is recording another album? It's been two years, and nobody has heard any of it. Apparently, he's recording at his place some kind of very long album, a bit like "In Search of Lost Time" but in the form of a record. You were all in love with him at the time. He was really good-looking. By the way, I don't even know if we talked even once. Maybe one time Your memory's coming back, Françoise. Are you alright? Do you have a headache? No, it's the dream I had last night. It's coming back to me. I was sitting at the Flandres's terrace. But the word "Flandres" had another signification. Another reality was hiding behind the name of the cafe. On top of that, I had no money. So the cafe's owner, who looked a lot like the great Catherine... ...refused to serve me. I went to the ATM. The instructions were written in Breton. [Man sings in Breton] I couldn't understand a thing. Even though I should have been able to. And at the end of the street There was a sphinx at the end of every street of Villejean. It's a bit too lucid for a dream, isn't it? That's because you had drunk wine your unconscious wasn't making too much effort. Do you think the unconscious is the type to make an effort? The effort to code, no? To transform into an enigma? But the enigma may have been there first. She may be the first language. And even, the only language capable of telling the reality. Are they fighting? They're the homeless from yesterday. They've come back. What are you gonna do? You're gonna drive me out, is that it? Go ahead! Hit me! Hit me! Don't you touch her! Don't you touch her! We're going! We're gone! - They're leaving, there's no need... Where is Ion? The right hand solemnly placed on the side. Are you alright? Maybe we should take him to the nurse's office. - He says he wants to see the end of the lecture. - Pardon me? He says he wants to see the end of the lecture! We are going to talk about the Lethe the river of Oblivion Which heals every ill when one drinks its water. But be careful, when one drinks the cup of Oblivion, one does not forget everything. There remains a reminiscence of the past life. And the idyllic Arcadian landscape also has for mission to revive the vague recollection of our past lives. The fracture is clean. There's no doubt. Am I gripping too hard? You're losing an 'E'. Ion! How did you get in? I showed my ID card, proved I was your mother. You're well protected! You see, I borrowed this after the shower. I'm doing better, Ion. I met someone. His name's Dav. In March, we'll be moving into a housing project in Toulouse. - What are you doing? - I've got homework to do. Me and Dav, we have all our stuff locked in a hotel in Mimizan. - In the Landes. - How do you know? That's right, my son is a geographer! - I'm not your son! - Whose son are you, then? I remember when you came out of my belly. You were really ugly. Don't you have a can of beer hidden somewhere? - You would have found it already. - And something to eat? There's rice in the kitchen. That's all you eat? Why don't you invite me to McDonald's? You've got a scholarship, don't you? - I've received nothing. They're late. - Ah shit... Is that why you came? For my scholarship? I came to see you. You're handsome. Six years, it's too long without seeing you, talking to you... We said we would never see each other again! You said that, you and all these assholes from social services! Anyway, it doesn't mean anything "never" except when everything is over. Fuck, it's freezing... Hey, it's freezing! Don't you think I've been cold enough in my life? Don't you think I've been cold enough... You've always done everything to be cold, to be hungry, to be hurt! Dave, look. My son. Ion, this is Dav. Hey, son. Ion, will you drink with us? - Non. I like your hair, how you style them all mussed up. You've got a mane of hair! Let me go. Where are you going? We'll have one drink and then we'll scram. Ion! I'm talking to you! Oh! Ion! - Hi - Hi Do you where's the symposium? I think there's a poster here, so it must be in the building there... Ok. Which building did you say it was? Right there, just in front of you. - Do you know if I need an ID badge? - No, I think you can go in like that. Are you sure? And you're not going? No, I have class over there. Bye. Maybe later, bye. The imitation of the look... for the First Renaissance painters would lead to the imitation of the landscape. Here, we can thus see the golden ribbon "il nastro dorato Di beato Angelico", like an infinity, an infinity which develops into a pictorial finitude at a time when perspective does not yet equate narrative. The Eye of the Renaissance needs this pennon like a relic from the Middle Ages mantras. But already, Paolo Uccello's tilings open under the feet of the astounded different perspectives... - You're alright, John? - Yeah. And you? And how could we not remember... I couldn't find anyone to replace me, so I have to leave in five minutes. ...he woke up at night to break through the mysteries of perspective. Thank you. - I didn't think you'd come. - Me neither, I haven't been here since... - You were at the University? - Yeah, English studies. Well, for three months... We will now listen to Françoise Diraison who teaches art history here in this university and whose lecture bears an intriguing title: "The Letter 'T', Ancestor of Perspective, or How God was Dismissed by the Human Eye during the Renaissance" Françoise, it's your turn. We can't wait to hear more. Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to contribute to this reflection on infinity which is the theme of this symposium. We'll begin by looking at a 14th century planisphere. Within the medieval convention, East is at the top so that Jerusalem and Mount Ararat culminate. At the summit of which you see Noah's Ark. This vertical river is actually the Mediterranean Sea. To the left, Europe. To the right, Africa. And at the top, the horizontal river is an amplification of the Danube, prolonged by the Red Sea. As you can see, these two axes form a "T", The Greek letter, Tau. The letter "T"... - Well, I'm going. First representation of the cross, before the crucifix I'll join you for the post-symposium drink. - There are drinks? - Always The initial of Theo, God. It appears that the initials of the divine is a cartographic element more important than visual reality, to the point of making the Danube and the Mediterranean Sea in equal widths, in any case, until the Renaissance. And even, two centuries later, We find the letter "T" in the most famous of imaginary cartographies The Map of Tendre. Between the Middle Ages and the 17th century, the letter "T", of Theo and of Tendre, has known another destiny, that of perspective which will consider as another manifestation of the "T", a "T" A "T" formed by the perpendicular between the axis of the cyclopean eye of the spectator, the convergence line and the horizon line of the painting. How are you, John? Stéphane had told me you might come. It was awesome to see you on stage. You weren't too bored? No, I was happy to be at a symposium. I dozed off in the dark with your voice in the background. It was nice. Everyone was sleeping, right? - No, I understood. The world is shapeless, so is reality. For a landscape to be visible, it needs to contain between the lines the letter "T" or the rules of perspective... or whatever rebus. Since the lecture, I find everything unreal. I love it. Bravo for your lecture - Thank you. I wanted to ask you... Can we drop the formalities? Yes. Hmm, I was sitting behind you at the college refectory the other day and I heard you recounting a dream. Maybe I shouldn't have... There was a sphinx that talked Breton, right? No, it's the ATM that spoke Breton. The sphinx wasn't saying anything... Well, you're changed the whole story again. [They speak Breton] Hmm, did someone talk Breton in your family? My grandparents. My parents too, but not as well. - And you? - Almost nothing, a few words. Would you be willing to talk about your dream at the Celtic and Breton faculty? Why? - We collect dreams. - Among other things. Every Summer, Catherine talked about showing up unannounced to your parents' bistro. Where was it? It's so small. I haven't been there in a long time. I have no family left there. Trégarvan. - What a memory! - It just came back to me. I was there last week. Really? You all know Trégarvan? The village centre, a little. - That's where my parents lived. I was always at my grandparents' farm. How was it called? You know all the farms? No, but we're interested in their names. It was sold. It's been more than 20 years. What was the sphinx's enigma? It's a riddle about the three stages of life. The answer is man. The farm was called "Kerellec". It's getting cold, isn't it? Are you John Le Scellier? Hey, you wouldn't have a cigarette? Can you give me a smoke, beautiful? I'll take two. Go ahead. Do you also have a light? You've got everything. No one has everything. Because... "In the middle of the deluge of calamities which ruined and drowned the unfortunate Italy, Not only had disappeared anything that could have born the name of "edifice" But also, which was even worse, the race of artists had completely died out". "When was born..." Ion! Hou hou! "In the year 1240, from the noble family of the Cimabue "Giovanni... nicknamed Cimabue, who would give back its luster to the art of painting." Growing up, Cimabue was deemed by his father and others to possess a sharp and subtle mind... and he was sent to study the Belles-Lettres at Santa Maria Novella, from a master who was related to him and who taught Grammar at that time to the monastery's novices. But instead of applying himself, and as if he was pushed by nature itself, he spent all his time drawing on his books and on other pieces of papers... What are you doing here with a book? On your own? Not even an atlas! Aren't you showering anymore? Why don't you come in class anymore? You still have your splint? Why aren't you living in your room? Where are you sleeping? Why don't you answer to Lydie anymore? Oh, can I speak? We don't want you to speak, we want you to get yourself sorted! Ion...Ion, wait. I don't know you, I don't know you, I don't know you... Wait for me! Your buddies in my room, I want them the hell out. I told them. And you too. Do you want to get coffee? - No. It's good being here with you. Even if it's cold, even if you're not talking to me...Still, we're together. It won't last but... ...we're together with our cigarettes. It's so great. Do you remember when we travelled to Greece? We slept on the bridge of ferries between two islands. You were almost 8. Where has it gone, this voyage? Where is it now? You suck! Die, you little jerk! Get the hell out! Die! Hey, you don't have a smoke? No sorry, I don't have any. Can you give me a cigarette, beautiful? I'll take two. Go ahead. Do you also have a light? You've got everything. No one has everything. Can I take your lighter? - Keep it. Thank you. Françoise. Who are you? I know your voice. Moon. Moon! Moon! For fuck's sake, are you stupid or what? Come sit down with us, Ion. Where is she? Who? Moon? Yeah. She's gone to Bruz - Her dump! Gone to see her old aunt, I believe. - The old aunt has kicked the bucket. - Do you want her number? - No, what old aunt? Ask her. She'll be back around midnight. She'll be there in time for the New Year. She must already be in town. She must be hanging around Rue de la Soif. That's why I don't see my daughter anymore. On the phone, it's alright but when I see her... You mean, when she sees you! Are you alright, Françoise? - Wine, my dear? - No, thanks. Let's toast to this wonderful night. Sköll! - SKÖLL! Françoise? Françoise! [They talk in Breton] - You're alright? - Yeah. - How about I tell you what we do here? - Yes. We're in the process of creating a laboratory of ethnology at the Breton and Celtic faculty. We're focusing on the practices of sociability in occidental Brittany during the 30-year post-war boom, their mutation, in a nutshell. We're working on the rituals of politeness, on objects of pride and objects of shame, the sorting in the transmission process of the language, the sentiment of the territory. And the magical practices. And you would like us to talk about... About you. About me? As a... As you. Your childhood, in Trégarvan, at that time. Ah... If that's alright with you. Ok. Well, I'm ethnologue...ethnological. But fine, if I can be useful to your research... The other day, after you left, John Le Scieller told us your grandfather was "diskonter". Yes, he was a healer. "Diskonter". I had forgotten this word. Did he have specialties? Yes, he healed fear. And red patches. For humans and animals too. I'm not used to talk about it. That's why we're interested. He healed what kind of fears? It could be the fear of a cow that couldn't calve anymore because lightning had struck close to it. Or the fear of a child, who had nightmares since a woodpile had fallen next to him. How would it go? People came looking for him, at any time, any hour. He could be in his potato field. He stopped his work to listen. He asked questions. It was rarely... And all of sudden, he would understand. He would leave. Sometimes, I stayed with the people. Sometimes... Sorry. Sometimes, I followed him. He let me follow him. He would always let me follow him. And where would he go? Behind the farm. It was always at the same spot. It was his spot. That's where he had his plants. What plants? Thanks. What made you cry? All of this. It remained living in my memory. A world stuck in time. Never talked about. Without words, like that. Untouched. Could we stop? I have to go the museum before it closes. I had forgotten, but I have to photograph a painting before tomorrow's lecture. Thank you. See you later, thanks. See you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Hello. - Is your grandfather here? - Sven? - Yes. How are you? Hmm, I asked the building manager. No one's seen you cardboard box. Sometimes, they use them to block the building's door and they forget about it. What was in it? - The letter "E". - Then, it doesn't matter. Give me a great writer whose name starts with the letter "E". Except for a few ancient Greeks... The transporter tells me I've got almost no chance to find it. A library shouldn't be moved on a sudden impulse. Actually, it shouldn't be moved at all. I missed my books. You're leaving me, Françoise. I don't think so. You're leaving me and the worst about it is that you're not realizing it. What I know is that... ...I need this experience of solitude. - The doorbell. - Must be a mistake. John? What are you doing here? - Am I bothering you? - I leave you to your experience of solitude. Sven! Would you like to sit down? Do you want something to drink? I have tea or... We're not going to stay here, are we? You're completely crazy to live here. Let's go for a ride, alright? Should I skip to the next song? - Why? The tracks are very long. The shorter is six and a half minutes. No, leave it... I like it. You're lucky getting to spend your time making music. And you're lucky to spend your life looking at paintings. ♪ Listen! The wings of the birds fluttering. ♪ That one is looking for its double ♪ under thundering applause. ♪ On the lake, there's a swan missing. ♪ Chosen by lightning, he is the same ♪ Alex... ♪ On the lake, there's a swan missing ♪ Alex, boxer in his spare time ♪ On the lake ♪ there's... ♪ A swan How do you manage to have such a good memory? It may be through constantly learning melodies, texts, songs. Couldn't the songs make you forget the rest? The rest, maybe. But not you. You're making things sound romantic, but at the time we barely knew each other. And we didn't talk, if only to say hello. Still, we went to the same concerts, and that's not nothing. I thought again of a man who came from a long way his face completely covered with red patches. It had lasted a very long time. In the darkness of the workshop, one patch after the other. My grandfather slowly circled them, each nine times with a wisp of straw murmuring an incantation... A magical incantation? Yes, and the last circle motion, without a word... ...blowing softly. Do it... Did you return to your room? No, not yet. Let me remind you you're not allowed to sublet or lend it to your friends. They're not friends. They're students with whom I'm studying for midterms. I didn't come to talk about my room but about my scholarship. Indeed, you should have received your scholarship at the start of the month. But since in the meantime your mother passed away... My mother passed away? They didn't tell you? Who's "they"? The police, The city of Bruz, the University! Where were you? Everyone was looking for you! I can't believe that no one let you know! Do you want a glass of water? This is your mother's death certificate. It's a good thing for you to have. Do you want me to call someone to get you? "For two centuries, a mythologic land, Arcadia acted as a shield between nature and humans, rendering invisible all of Europe's landscapes. But, what is this time during which we choose to represent the landscape such as Mediterranean mountains bedecked with thickets, populated by nymphs, shepherds and cyclopes? It's precisely at that time when started in America and in Africa, and also in Europe, the intensive exploitation, outrageous, of nature's riches. Until one stands physically in front of a painting, in its real dimensions, one can't really understand anything about it. I too, am glad to virtually wander in all the world's museums thanks to the internet, but there's a Fine Arts museum in this city, which contains a few noteworthy works. I visit it often but since the start of term, I haven't seen any of you there. Well, I'm going. Are you sure you don't want to come with me? I'll call you, tell you about it. Good morning, I would like to see Mr. Nédellec, please. I represent the collective of the visually impaired. Yes, I was informed. Stéphane has not arrived yet. Do you want to wait for him in his office? - Yes, please. Bye. - Good morning, Lydie. - Good morning. - Are you alright? - Yes. Would you like some tea? Some coffee? Hmm, some tea. Let me show you to the couch. Thank you but there's no need, I know where it is. - See you in a minute then. - Thank you. Ion? Are you living here? In the library? The transporter says I've got almost no chance to find it. I missed my books. I don't think so. What I know is that... I need this experience of solitude. It must be a mistake. John? What are you doing here? - Am I bothering you? - I leave to your experience of solitude. Sven! Come in. The key under the welcoming mat, really? That way, I'm not losing it. I saw my neighbor... - ...and your driver's license, - I have it. I don't know how to drive anymore. - Don't worry, it's like riding a bike. - Even after 20 years without driving? - Yes. Speaking about that... - Françoise? - Stéphane? How are you? I just got a call from the great Catherine. It's sad news. She told me that Moon has died. When? She was found on January 1st in an agricultural building, not far from Bruz. Died from the cold. At the time, we had a sound system. We would show up anywhere, up to 14 trucks sometimes. We'd arrive in a field, put on the music, and the sound created the territory, 'Çoise. You didn't know that, did you? No, when I arrived in Paris I started to see other people, stopped going to the concerts. What we did, it was not the concerts, this thing where you line up one track after the other. The track lasted two hours, all night. It was an experience, a trance! From the back of a field, anywhere really. It was so good to make people dance, without end, without hours, without gates, without money. We weren't asking for money. Why did it stop? Ion. When they took him away from me, they put him in family here and there. I tried not to be too far from him, so I would see him a little. I kidnapped him too. Three times. - He's your son? - Yeah. He's studying at the University here these days. Do you want me to lend you my apartment? The Christmas holidays start on Friday. I'm going to Paris. What about when you come back? You could stay, while you figure things out. hmm...I'm not on my own. I have Dav. He's always with his two stupid friends. Fuck, I can't stand them anymore. Do you...want to bring them with you? Forget it, 'Çoise. Buy me another half-pint and "kenavo"! Your coat is beautiful. Hmm, I bought it yesterday, on Saint-Georges street. Will you give it to me? Ah, but I just bought it. Earlier, you asked what was it that I wanted. So I'm telling you, your coat. Please, 'Çoise. If you want, we'll meet tomorrow, downtown, I'll buy you the same, with pleasure! Tomorrow, downtown! Tomorrow downtown... Why not here and now? Why do I have to wait? Tomorrow night, I'll be in Barcelona or somewhere else! Let me try it on. Come on, 'Çoise, let me try it on. I'll give it back to you! Alright. Wait! Wow, it looks really good on me! Well I'm keeping it! But Moon, please! I'll give you enough to buy yourself the same one. You're pissing me off! You're the one who wanted to give me something! Moon! Moon! Moon! I'm keeping it! - Moon! That's the one. In bloom. He only used the leaves. Do you remember its name? They were all ordinary plants, that grow everywhere, that no one notices, some sort of weed. I don't even know if they had a name. "Trompili glaz", the carpet bugleweed. - Nine were needed to heal fear, right? - Yes. - Did you know how to recognize them? - Yes. Sometimes, he sent me searching for them when he was missing one. So he must have designated them one way or the other. In French, in Latin, in Breton. I can't remember. No, not in Latin... "Linat", the stinging nettle. And that one? "Krampouz mouzig", The navelwort [known as "nombril de Vénus" in French = Venus's navel] "Krampouz mouzig"... Yes, it was one of them. Yes, this one too. "An troc'h". How is it pronounced? "Louzounn an troc'h". "Louzounn an troc'h"... "Louzaouenn an troc'h", the yarrow. What Romanticism introduces, is the incongruity of man in nature. Nature is bigger than him and threatening. Contrary to what has often been said, Romanticism isn't a communion with nature, but rather a fear in the face of it. The communion is over. With the industrial civilization, nature has become barbaric and mutic. It risks at any moment to give birth again to the darkest emotions. Nature is projected to the side of the unconscious forces. Thank you. See you next year. We'll talk about it again. Hello. We don't know each other but... - We met once. The last time I saw my mother, she was with you. You're Ion, Moon's son. Yes. Huh... Right now I have to go, I'm in a dissertation jury. But we need to meet, we need to talk... Are you done with your exams? Almost. It's not looking good but... There's a trip... It's not very far, I wanted to do it alone but... do you want to come with me? Do you want me to tell you where it is? No, anywhere's fine. I'll come. "All day long, ...in this house a bit too "country", which only looked like a place to nap, in between two strolls or during the downpour, ...one of these houses where every room looks like a den of greenery... and where, on the hanging of the bedrooms, the roses of the garden in one, the birds of the trees in the other, have joined you and keep you company isolated, at least, for these were old hangings on which each rose was separate enough from the others, so that we could have plucked it, had it been alive, so that we could put each bird in a cage to tame them. Without any of these large decorations... of today's bedrooms, where on a silver background, all the apple trees of Normandy... have taken shape in the Japanese style, to hallucinate the hours... that you spend in bed." "All day long... I remained in my room which... looked out onto the beautiful greeneries... of the park and onto the lilacs of the entrance, the green leaves... of the tall trees by the water, gleaming in the sun... and Méséglise forest." Wow! - It's beautiful, huh? It's wild... - Are you alright? Not afraid? - No, why? I haven't driven in a while. - It doesn't show. - Really? That's good. Do you know them? - No. But these two fields belonged to my grandfather. Kerellec. I don't know if I want to see the farm again... ...with other people living in it. Come, we'll take this path. Has it changed? No. But... ...we'll come back later. Let's go eat. What will you do this Summer? I'll work for a market gardener. And then, I'm going to Greece with Lydie. She's my friend. In the Aegean Sea. What about you? I don't know yet. I just left the man I shared the last 15 years of my life with. So, I can do whatever I want. I've started writing on the representation of dreams in painting. I really want to work but at the same time, for the first time, I'm very much looking forward to doing nothing.
