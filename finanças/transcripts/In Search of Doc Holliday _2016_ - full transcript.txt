Subtitles by KRF Studio Tombstone, Arizona Territory, 1881 The gunfight at the OK Corral is the Old West?s most famous shootout and makes instant celebrities of the combatants, included amongst them is a gambler and gunslinger known as ?Doc Holliday? It?s the beginning of a legend. But this is where Doc Holliday?s story really began, here in the American south, in the state of Georgia. Doc Holliday was born John Henry Holliday, a descendant of two Scots-Irish families that had settled in frontier Georgia, soon after the American Revolution at a time when much of Georgia was still Indian territory. His mother?s family, the McKeys, owned a plantation near Indian Creek, Georgia with hundreds of acres of cotton and dozens of slaves to work the land. While John Henry?s maternal grandparents were members of Georgia?s social class of wealthy planters, his father?s family, the Hollidays, were of more modest circumstances. [Bill Dunn]: William Holliday moved into a little community called Tumbling Shoals in South Carolina. And from there the family moved to different places all over the country, some of the family believed in slavery, some did not and they chose not to go into the southern states. [Narrator]: Henry Burroughs Holliday was William?s eldest son. With no great estate to inherit, Henry chose a career in the military, and served in the Creek Indian and Mexican Wars. When he returned from the war, he moved to Griffin, Georgia where he met and married Alice Jane McKey. Griffin was a town full of opportunity for an ambitious young man like Henry Holliday. He took a job with a local druggist and built his family a comfortable two-storey home on Tinsley Street. It was in Griffin, Georgia that Henry and Alice Jane Holliday?s two children were born. The first, a daughter they named Martha Eleanora, lived only six months. A little over a year later, on August 14, 1851, the Holliday?s second child was born, a boy named John Henry. He was christened in March of 1852 in Griffin?s First Presbyterian Church. There was also an adopted older brother, a Mexican orphan boy named Francisco Hidalgo, whom his father had brought home from the Mexican War and raised as a member of the family. 25 miles to the west of Griffin were John Henry?s paternal family in the city of Fayetteville. The uncle after whom John Henry was named, John Stiles Holliday, had gone off to the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, and returned home to become Fayetteville?s town doctor. Local tradition says that the Holliday?s home in Fayetteville was once used as a dormitory space for the Fayetteville Academy, the local boarding school where a girl named Annie Fitzgerald studied. [Victoria Wilcox]: Annie lived on a big cotton plantation in nearby Clayton County and members of her family became characters in a book written by one of her descendants, the descendant was an Atlanta journalist named Margaret Mitchell and the book she wrote is called "Gone With The Wind", in which Scarlett O'Hara was said to have studied at the Fayetteville Academy. [Narrator]: John Henry?s uncle, Robert Kennedy Holliday, would marry Mary Anne Fitzgerald making Doc Holliday and famed novelist Margaret Mitchell kin through marriage. Life during those early years was peaceful. But tensions between the south and the federal government were rising, and the way of life that John Henry had known would end abruptly with the first shots fired from Fort Sumter in 1861 heralding the start of the Civil War. [Gary Roberts]: And then the war came. and most of the Holliday and McKey relatives were suddenly in the Confederate army and John Henry was left at home with the women folk, as he was the youngest of that particular family. [Narrator]: Back in Griffin, ten-year-old John Henry?s McKey uncles had also enlisted in the Confederate Army, as had his father, Henry Holliday, once a United States army officer, he was made a Confederate Major on Christmas Day of 1861. But his service lasted just over a year, as he took ill during the Siege of Richmond, and resigned his commission with the Army. While most of the Holliday family had settled in Griffin, Henry and John Stiles Holliday?s brother, Robert Holliday, along with his wife, Mary Anne Fitzgerald and their eight children, had settled in the town of Jonesboro, ten miles east of Fayetteville. The eldest of his children was a girl named Martha Anne, nicknamed Mattie, she was said to have been John Henry?s favorite cousin. She would serve as his lifelong pen pal and some would later question the true nature of their relationship. When the Civil War began, Robert Holliday registered the deeds to his several Jonesboro properties, put money in a trust for his wife and children, and, like his brothers, enlisted in the Confederate Army. Concerned about Sherman?s army, Henry Holliday sold his house and properties in Griffin, packed up his family and bought train tickets on the Macon and Western Railroad. Their destination would be the little village of Valdosta. To John Henry, now twelve years old, the trip must have seemed like the adventure of a lifetime. [Gary Roberts]: Now Valdosta was a very different environment than Griffin. It was still coming out of the woods, so to speak, it was not a very big town the only thing that gave it any identity at all was the fact that there was a railroad through it. So, suddenly he's in what amounts to a frontier community, it doesn't have a great social system, there are not a lot of people that he knows, so things change for him. [Narrator]: Henry Holliday purchased land at Cat Creek, seven miles outside of the town of Valdosta and set to farming. There were other family members moving south as well. John Henry?s McKey aunts from Griffin and Robert Holliday?s wife and children from Jonesboro, all came to stay on Henry Holliday?s farm at Cat Creek, while the men were off fighting far-away battles on bloody battlegrounds. John Henry attended the local school, the Valdosta Institute. [Gary Roberts]: He was popular, he was good on the dance floor, he had learned all the proper social graces. He was polite, and he seems to have gotten along well with most people. But he also had an ornery side. They tell a story that a boy challenged him to a duel. Now all of the friends, the people of these two boys, assumed it was going to be a fake duel. They were going to load pistols with powder and shoot powder at each other. And it was just going to be a make-believe duel. But John Henry, they said, showed up with a loaded revolver, and said that he would use his own gun for the duel. Well, needless to say, the other boy backed down very quickly. So, he had a streak in him. [Narrator]: When the war ended in 1865, John Henry?s uncles made their way home. For a time, it must have seemed that life would return to normal, but a year after the war ended, his mother lost her own battle, passing away in September of 1866 of consumption. In the troubled years after the end of the Civil war ? a time called ?Reconstruction? with martial law and Federal soldiers stationed in southern towns, there was opportunity. Henry Holliday, setting aside his Confederate loyalty, signed an oath of allegiance to the Federal government, and took advantage of the situation by becoming an agent for the Freedman?s Bureau to oversee the redistribution of land as the old plantations were broken up and the former slaves were made land-owning tenant farmers. With his new position and work in town, Henry moved his family from the Cat Creek farm to Valdosta. As the Union troops began to move into the area, a young man named Dick Force, who had been a Confederate soldier at Gettysburg would become a casualty of the tensions in the town. When 103rd United States Colored Infantry took over Valdosta, there was friction. Dick Force was arrested for assaulting a freedman. Four hours later, he escaped and decided to go to a party, when Union troops showed up to re-arrest him, Dick resisted and was shot, he died of his wounds four hours later. [Gary Roberts]: And so, they had what amounted to a local hero and Doc Holliday looked up to this young man. Who wasn't that much older than Doc. And so, when you consider that that's happening, in conjunction with a couple of other things, Like, for example, the fact that his own father becomes the head of the Freedman's Bureau, Doc resented that, then his mother dies, and then three or four months later his father marries again to a young woman who was a neighbor and very much younger than his father. Well all of these things increased the friction that he had with his father. [Narrator]: An attempt to blow up the courthouse in Valdosta was discovered and several local boys were suspected. [Gary Roberts]: I don?t think it was a real attempt they were just showing off, a bunch of boys showing off when a guy who was running for Congress came through and there was a small explosion. but several people were arrested and John Henry was sent away to Jonesboro during this time, so one of the things that?s happening here is that there?s this growing estrangement with his father and he?s thinking I need to get away from this place and another of the new arrivals in Valdosta, was a dentist named Frink, Frink was again a Confederate veteran someone that he could relate to he began to talk to him about becoming a dentist. He also had the opportunity to talk to his Uncle John Stiles Holliday who was a physician. So in 1870, he makes the decision to go away to school and I think everybody thought it was a good thing for him to get away, and go to dental school in Philadelphia. [Narrator]: For John Henry, going to dental school meant leaving the south for the first time. He took the train from Valdosta to Savannah, and then boarded a ship to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The city must have seemed enormous to him. With a population of nearly three-quarters of a million, Philadelphia was the second largest city in the country. Compared to it, Atlanta with its twenty thousand was just a town, and Valdosta, with three hundred residents, little more than a country village. Located in a five-story building at the corner of Filbert and Twelfth Street, the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery was one of the best dental schools in the country. John Henry faced a challenging academic schedule of classes six days a week. But it wasn?t all work for him. Tall, thin and ash-blonde, he was a handsome young man free for the first time of the confines of his conservative upbringing and in a city that had much to offer for a young bachelor. Philadelphia had its share of gambling dens, saloons, and brothels of which he likely visited. He was apparently a gifted student. By the time his first term ended, he had become adept at the academic knowledge, and practical training of dentistry. Although the college held a spring session, he returned to Valdosta where he spent the next eight months working with Dr Frink. In September 1871, John Henry returned to Philadelphia with much valuable experience that equipped him for the second year during which he developed his thesis ?Diseases of the Teeth?. Each of the other requirements were met and John Henry was scheduled to graduate on March 1, 1872. But, qualification for graduation required that the candidate be twenty-one years of age and he was still five months short of turning twenty-one. An opportunity presented itself when one of his classmates, A. Jameson Fuches Jr was returning to his home state of Missouri to practice in St. Louis. Fuches opened an office on Fourth Street and John Henry joined him there. St. Louis was a hardy, bawdy place. Near Fusches? office was a theatre and a saloon. One of the employees there was a woman who went by the name of Kate Fisher. Born Mary Katharine Harony in Pest, Hungary on November 7, 1850, Kate was the first of seven children. Her family immigrated to the United States in or around 1860 and settled in Davenport, Iowa among a colony of Hungarians. Kate abandoned her family after her parents? death, changed her name to Kate Fisher, and was likely working as a prostitute when John Henry arrived in St Louis. The nature of the relationship between John Henry and Kate Fisher at this time remains a mystery. Later in life, Kate recalled that his stay in St. Louis was brief, he left in the summer of 1872 and returned to Georgia. [Victoria Wilcox]: Home for John Henry now would be Atlanta where he would be practicing with Dr Arthur C Ford who was the past president of the Georgia Dental Association. [Narrator]: After a few months of work in Atlanta, John Henry was on the move again, this time back to his hometown of Griffin to register the deed to his inheritance property known as the iron-front building. By the summer of 1873, he had sold his inheritance and left Griffin. [Victoria Wilcox]: The popular story is that Holliday went West because he was diagnosed with a fatal case of the lung disease consumption shortly after he finished dental school and was told he had only three or four months to live if he didn?t move to the high, dry plains of the American West, and so he packed his bags and he went to Dallas, Texas. Where he quickly got tired of dentistry and became a gambling gunfighter. There's some problems with that story. Dallas, Texas, as anybody who has ever been there knows, is neither high, nor dry, it's just as humid as Atlanta. And that very year that he was there, it had just been closed down by a Yellow Fever epidemic and was actually famous in the newspapers at the time as being the second least healthy place in the United States to live. [Narrator]: What made John Henry leave Georgia and his family behind? It may have been his desire to escape the pall of a winter of family tragedies. His uncle, Robert Holliday, Mattie?s father, died on Christmas Eve of 1872. One month later, John Henry?s adopted half-brother, Francisco Hildago, died of consumption. Or it could have been that his desire to leave was a matter of the heart for it was rumored that John Henry was in love with his cousin, Mattie Holliday. [Gary Roberts]: There may be something to that. They had been very close their whole lives and remained close throughout his life. Even after she became a nun she kept his letters which was very unusual, the biggest problem, if this is the case, was that while first cousins marrying was very common in 19th century life, it was not common among Catholics and she was Catholic. [Narrator]: Yet another possibility, as was later noted by Bat Masterson and others, is that his leaving Georgia had to do with a deadly shooting that was said to have taken place near the family?s property in Valdosta when John Henry encountered a group of black youths swimming in the family?s water hole. [Gary Roberts]: Now there are several versions, one says that they were told to leave and they didn?t and that Doc fired into them and killed several. Another version says that they were told to leave and they became defiant and Doc killed one of them. and the other says that Doc didn?t kill anybody but fired over their heads. Even that was still tricky during Reconstruction, that might get you in trouble. Even during Reconstruction. I?m inclined to believe that it?s a combination, I think the reason Doc came back to Valdosta was because he had contracted consumption and was concerned about that, he may have been in love with Mattie and saw that that was going nowhere. And then he gets home, when he gets home he's an angry young man. And he goes out on the river, and he sees this situation and he fired into the group. Now, his uncle, Tom McKey, said that he fired over their heads, but what would you expect Tom McKey to say? So, it could have been that he killed someone. [Narrator]: In the summer of 1873, John Henry left Georgia for Texas. Whatever demons were chasing him followed him out West. John Henry ended up in Dallas, Texas, a railroad boomtown on the Trinity River. [Patrick Allitt]: At the end of the Civil War, there was a great pentup enthusiasm for Western development, it had been going on very rapidly particularly since the 1840s. The California Gold Rush of 1849 had lead a huge number of people to the West and so had the settlement of the Willamette Valley in Oregon, which was the cause of the creation of the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. This migration went on through the 1850s, was interrupted by the Civil War, but then resumed again at full speed as soon as the fighting had finished. During the Civil War, Congress had passed the Homestead Act in 1862, which gave settlers the right to acquire title to a 160-acre farm simply by settling there, and farming it for five years. And so tens of thousands of people moved to the Great Plains in order to set up farms for themselves. Homestead farms. [Narrator]: It may have been the offer of a dental partnership that drew him to Dallas, as he soon went into practice with Dr. John Seegar, a former Georgian who had lived near the Holliday family in Fayetteville. Dallas was still rough around the edges, with a muddy main street lined with saloons and crowded with herds of cows and pigs being driven to market. But there was also a new brick courthouse, two theatres and several hotels. In October 1873, the city hosted the Texas state fair. The dental practice of Seegar & Holliday entered the Scientific Exhibition with samples of dental work in gold, porcelain and ivory. They won three blue ribbons and a fifteen dollar cash prize. John Henry attended the local Methodist Church and took part in meetings for the Temperance League fighting against public drunkenness. But his days as a respectable professional man did not last long. [Victoria Wilcox]: Within a year of John Henry's arrival in Dallas he had separated from his dental partner, Dr. John Seegar and the firm of Seegar & Holliday was dissolved by mutual consent, the paper said. And that Dr. Holliday would be responsible for the two debts against the practice. [Narrator]: After the dissolution, John Henry opened his own practice in a rented space above the Dallas County Bank and he soon returned to the saloons and gambling houses of Dallas. Although the Old West has a reputation for wide open gambling, in most western towns it was against the law to gamble in a house of ?spiritus liquors? ---meaning a saloon. The saloon keepers solved the problem by having one room for drinking and another room for cards. But as the sporting men, as they were called, tended to drift from one room to another with drinks and poker chips in their hands, the legal line was easily crossed. [Gary Roberts] He was arrested for gambling and a month later again arrested for gambling. So, he leaves Dallas and goes to Denison, Texas. [Narrator]: The north Texas town of Denison was along the Red River that bounded the Indian Nation. The town was still prospering, in spite of the Depression, thanks to the newly invented refrigerated rail cars that shipped out butchered beef from Texas to hungry markets in the east. Denison was the packing point, bringing an influx of workers and the sporting men that followed them. Holliday opened a dental practice in Denison, and likely spent time in the saloons and gambling halls in the muddy ravine called Skiddy Street ?the first ?Skid Row? in the country. But by the fall, Denison was hit by the same economic depression that had crippled the rest of the country, and the packing plant and the railroad shipping came to a halt. Without a paying clientele, John Henry?s practice dried up as well, and he headed back to Dallas. He arrived in time to celebrate the holidays and get himself involved in a New Year?s Day shootout with a bartender named Charlie Austin who went by the nickname ?Champagne Charlie? for the popular song of the time. The song was lighthearted, and so was the report in the Dallas papers: ?Dr Holliday and Mr Austin, a saloon-keeper, relieved the monotony of the noise of fire-crackers by taking a couple of shots at each other yesterday afternoon. The cheerful note of the peaceful six-shooter is heard once more among us. Both shooters were arrested.? But the law didn?t take the event so lightly, and John Henry found himself in jail and in court once again, charged with assault with intent to commit murder. The penalty for a guilty verdict was two to twenty years in the state prison. He was found not guilty of the assault charge. He plead guilty to the gambling charge and paid a $10 fine. [Gary Roberts]: Eventually he feels it?s in his best interest to leave Dallas. [Narrator]: Now known as ?Doc? Holliday, he settled into Fort Griffin, which was located 100 miles west of Dallas. It was considered one of the wildest places in all of the Old West, built on a high bluff between the West fork of the Trinity River and the Clear Fork of the Brazos river, the town kept watch over the Plains Indians and the buffalo hunt and cattle trails. Fort Griffin had a lively saloon culture and when a new sheriff was sent over from the town of Albany to clean it up, the name of J.H. Holliday was among the list of gamblers on the arrest warrant. Doc was soon to encounter an old acquaintance. If their relationship in St Louis remains to question, it was not so in Fort Griffin for it was here that Kate Fisher almost certainly became his mistress. [Victoria Wilcox]: According to Kate?s memoirs, Holliday travelled south to the Rio Grande to the border town of Eagle Pass and then he crossed over the river to the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo where he did some dentistry for the commandant of the Mexican presidio. It seems strange to think of Holliday in Mexico, but the language may not have been a problem for him because he was raised with the Mexican orphan boy Francisco Hidalgo in his home and so we believe he spoke Spanish. [Narrator]: But the ride to Mexico would have been long and arduous for a healthy person, and down-right brutal for someone suffering from consumption. Why would Doc have taken such a journey? The trip to Mexico may have had to do with a story later told by Bat Masterson whose account of Doc?s life, while flawed, is generally believed to be reliable. Bat claimed that Doc killed a black soldier at Jacksonboro. No such event was reported in either the papers or the records of the time, but an incident did occur at Fort Griffin that might well have been the shooting Masterson recalled. On the night of March 3, 1876, Private Jacob Smith, a Buffalo Soldier, who was ?absent without authority? from Fort Griffin was shot and killed by an unknown party. The unknown assailant was never arrested, but Doc fled Fort Griffin around the time of the shooting, this time using an alias to hide his identity. He ended up in Denver, Colorado, hiding behind the name of his mother?s brother, Tom McKey. He took a job using that name as a faro dealer for gambling hall owner Charley Foster in Babb?s Variety House. [Victoria Wilcox]: Doc Holliday wasn?t just writing letters and dealing Faro cards in Denver, however. According to another old story he was also getting into some trouble with a fellow gambler named Bud Ryan. According to this story, he and Ryan got into a dispute and he took out a huge knife and about beheaded Bud Ryan and killed him. However, Bud Ryan was still alive years later as he recounted the story himself and amazingly considered himself one of Doc Holliday?s friends. [Narrator]: After months of hiding out as Tom McKey, Doc had returned to Dallas by January 1877 where he may have thought to make another try at life as a professional man. Instead, he found himself quickly arrested again on a series of gambling charges. The city, it seemed, was cleaning itself up and becoming respectable. But there were friendlier towns that actually welcomed sporting men, like Breckenridge, newly established and celebrating its first birthday with wide-open gambling games. But for Doc, it wasn?t quite friendly enough. [Victoria Wilcox]: According to a story in a Fort Worth newspaper, Holliday got into an altercation with a gambler in the town of Breckenridge, Texas. The gambler's name was Henry Khan and according to the story, Holliday pulled a cane and hit him and Khan pulled a gun and shot Holliday. We don?t know which man was in the right or the wrong, We don?t even know what they were fighting about or whether they were both just drunk and disorderly. But the newspaper went on to say that Holliday had been killed and Khan disappeared from town. We know their report is at least a little bit inaccurate because of course Holliday was still alive and he actually returned back to Dallas where he was quickly arrested again on more gambling charges. [Narrator]: Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, he left Dallas once and for all and headed west again, back to the town of Fort Griffin where he met a man who would change his life from outlaw to legend. Upon his arrival in Fort Griffin at the end of summer in 1877, Doc checked into the Occidental Hotel and opened an account at Smith?s bar. Within a week, he?d amassed a liquor bill of $120, while spending just over $20 for his room and meals. In late September, as cattle driving season was winding down, Fort Griffin became a sleepy town. In search of business and sport, Doc left the town and in his company was Kate who by this time had changed her name from Kate Fisher to Kate Elder. Kate later recalled that they travelled through south and southwest Texas. They stopped briefly at Loredo, then moved up river to Eagle Pass, where Kate says they stayed for three months. From Eagle Pass, they moved on to San Antonio where they stayed for a few weeks, before eventually returning to Fort Griffin in the early spring of 1878. Thirty year old Wyatt Earp was already a seasoned gambler and lawman when he met Doc Holliday in Fort Griffin in 1878. He had lived in and traveled through several states, been arrested for horse theft, escaped custody, and had joined the Marshall?s office three years earlier. He was passing through Fort Griffin when he met Doc for the first time. The details and circumstances of their first meeting are lost to time, and Wyatt would not stay long in Fort Griffin, but he and Doc would soon meet again. Front Street, Dodge City, Kansas: the end of the trail for the Texas cattle drives. From late spring until late summer, Dodge City was filled with weary cowboys with trail pay in their pockets, looking for some fun. And some of them were looking for relief from toothaches as well. Doc and Kate arrived in the summer of 1878 and took rooms together in the Dodge House Hotel, where Holliday also set out his dental tools again. His new practice was announced in the Dodge City Times ?J.H. Holliday, dentist, very respectfully offers his professional services to the citizens of Dodge City and surrounding country during the summer. Office at room number 24 Dodge House. Where satisfaction is not given money will be refunded.? Doc seems to have behaved himself in Dodge City, his name did not show up in the press or in the police court records. [Gary Roberts]: It was one of the more peaceful times in his life. And there?s a persistent story and one which I believe because Wyatt Earp always insisted upon it that there was an incident involving a group of cowboys and that Doc Holliday came to Wyatt Earp?s assistance and saved his life in the process. That?s what Wyatt always said and there are a couple of incidents that fit the bill in the records in Dodge City. Dodge was a place where Doc stayed out of trouble, but it was not good to him as far as his health was concerned that Kansas High plains winters and so forth were not good for his consumption and so he eventually left there. And moved to New Mexico. [Narrator]: They arrived at the old plaza in Las Vegas, New Mexico. And checked into the newly built Hot Springs Hotel. Las Vegas was a sleepy Spanish town about to boom with the coming of the railroad. But it was the water, not the rails that drew him to the town. In nearby Gallinas Canyon was the Montezuma Hot Springs, famous for centuries for its healing waters. [Gary Roberts]: Las Vegas was a rough town. it had a group that was known as the Dodge City gang that more or less ran things there and there were lots of shady characters. And one of them was a young man named Billy Leonard. Now Billy, like Doc, was a consumptive, they both had tuberculosis. And that was something that may have drawn them together. [Narrator]: Doc?s friendship with Billy Leonard would come back to haunt him. But for now, he had other adventures in store, like a return to Dodge City in the spring of 1879 likely at the request of Bat Masterson. [Victoria Wilcox]: Bat Masterson was sheriff in Ford County Kansas, home of Dodge City and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and the railroad hired him to put together its private army Dodge City was the gathering place and soon gunmen from all over the west were coming together there to get ready to go out and defend what they considered their own railroad. And Doc Holliday was one of those shooters who went to work for the Santa Fe. [Narrator]: They were to defend the Santa Fe Railroad?s right-of-way through the Royal Gorge of the Colorado. The Royal Gorge is a 10 mile long, 1200 foot deep gash in the granite mountains of southern Colorado. Carved by the Arkansas River, the gorge was once the wintering grounds for the Ute Indians. The 1877 discovery of silver and lead in nearby Leadville prompted a race to build rail access to the area, with two railroads competing for the narrow canyon, there was only room for one set of rails, so both sent armed guards, resulting in a confrontation known as the ?Royal Gorge War?. The war came to nothing more than a few standoffs and a few shots fired before the Federal courts stepped in to end the hostilities. Doc had been part of the force that held the roundhouse at Pueblo before Bat Masterson announced the legal end to the conflict. In July 1879, Doc was back in Las Vegas in time to celebrate another Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe victory ?the completion of the rail line from Colorado down into New Mexico, heading toward its namesake city of Santa Fe. With the arrival of the railroad the personality of Las Vegas changed from a sleepy Spanish town to a rowdy railroad boomtown, and Holliday must have seen an opportunity. He bought some property on Centre Street near the railroad depot and opened a tent saloon, then contracted with a local carpenter to turn his tent into a more permanent wood structure. [Victoria Wilcox]: ]: Of course, Doc was in trouble with the law again because Las Vegas had laws just like all western towns did against operating gambling games in houses of "spirituous liquors" so he just did what other business men did and paid the fines and went right on operating his gambling games he also had arrests for carrying a deadly weapon which was also part of business in a saloon. Because a saloon-owner was expected to police his own business and had to be armed to protect his patrons from violence. On the night of July 19, 1879, Doc got into a shootout with Mike Gordon, reported to be a mean drunk. Bat Masterson later recounted that Doc shot Mike Gordon dead after Gordon fired shots into Doc?s saloon. Doc wasn?t charged with the murder but would again be arrested for gambling and carrying a deadly weapon. The case was dismissed, but he soon after surrendered his saloon to his liquor wholesaler in settlement of accounts and left Las Vegas. It may have been a visit from his old friend, Wyatt Earp, passing through town that made Doc pack up and take to the trail again, this time headed to Prescott, Arizona. Massive Thumb Butte dominates the skyline over the city of Prescott in the pine-scented Bradshaw Mountains of central Arizona. When Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp arrived there in 1879, Prescott was the new capital of the Arizona Territory, and already famous for its politicians and a street called ?Whiskey Row?. Wyatt wasn?t the first Earp to try out Prescott. His older brother, Virgil, had arrived the year before and was running a sawmill in the shadow of Thumb Butte. He had also been recently appointed a deputy United States Marshal, and was making plans to move to Tombstone along with Wyatt. But Doc seemed to favor Prescott and he turned down Wyatt?s invitation to travel on to Tombstone. It might have been Whiskey Row that tempted him to stay, with its famous saloons, like the Palace, and its gaming halls. Or it may have been a quarrel with his mistress, Kate Elder, who left him and moved on alone to the mining camp of Globe. So Doc was single again, and took a room with a politician named John Gosper ? who happened to be the Acting Governor of the Arizona Territory. Holliday and Gosper might have seemed an unlikely pair of associates, the one-time Texas outlaw and the head of the Arizona Territorial government. But Holliday?s Southern heritage and his professional training made him more than Gosper?s equal. So, in spite of his past troubles, Doc found himself back in good company at last, and living next door to the wealthy merchant William Buffum, one of the leading men in the Territorial Legislature. But as with most towns, Doc had soon had enough of Prescott and moved on to Tombstone. The Tombstone mining district sits atop a mesa in the San Pedro River valley. This was the land of the Apaches led by Chief Cochise and the warrior Geronimo. Although claimed by the United States as part of the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, it was still a no-man?s land for white settlers. At least until prospector Ed Scheffelin came along, searching for silver. By September 1879, Doc had arrived in Tombstone. [Gary Roberts]: There is a little bit of a question as to why he moved on to Tombstone, the most common one is that he decided finally to check out what was going on and he went down on his own. There are a couple of other possibilities. One is that he was invited by Wyatt Earp. And there is another that he was part of a group of people who showed up in Tombstone about the same time, that included people like Bat Masterson and William H. Harris and others who all had Dodge City connections. The problem was that there was a gambler?s war going on in Tombstone. The Dodge City establishment was generally referred to the well-established gamblers were mostly "Easterners" they were called although Eastern is relative you know but they included people like Richard Clark and Robert Winders and others that were friends of the Earps. And they were challenged by a group of gamblers who came out of California and other places but they were known as the "Slopers". so there is this rivalry between the Slopers and the Easterners and several well-known Dodge City people happened to come to Tombstone about that time. [Narrator]: The heart of the Tombstone story has to do with the quarrel between the Earps and their friends and the group that was known as the Cowboys. The Cowboys were mostly rustlers who lived in the outlying areas of Cochise county. They had been there before the town was established and they had a fairly lucrative business stealing cattle in Mexico and bringing them up into Arizona to sell to the Army and the Indian agencies. [Gary Roberts]: There was friction between the Earps as lawmen and as friends of lawmen and the Cowboys from a fairly early time but it all begins to come to a climax in 1881. [Narrator]: On March 15, 1881, Doc rented a horse at Dunbar?s stable and left Tombstone. He later claimed that he went to Charleston to join in a high-stakes poker game, but he found that the game had broken up by the time he arrived. Wyatt would later claim that Holliday returned to Tombstone and played a game of faro with him and was still playing when the word came to Tombstone that the Kinnear & Company stagecoach headed to Benson had been held up and that two men had been killed. At the request of Bat Masterson, the Earp brothers joined the posse to hunt down the assailants. Tombstone was full of rumors and Kate Elder, who had briefly rejoined Doc, would later recount a curious encounter soon after the robbery. Warren Earp came calling for Doc late one night at their hotel, and Doc left with him in the dead of night to visit Wyatt. He was gone for over an hour before he came back agitated, ?The damned fool. I did not think that of him,? Doc was said to have repeated over and over again. The reasons for Doc?s concerns were soon to come to light. The next day, March 24, The Tucson Star reported: ?The names of the three who are traveling are Bill Leonard, Jim Crane, and Harry Hickey. The fourth is at Tombstone and is well known and has been shadowed ever since his return.? The fourth party alluded to in the report was almost certainly Doc Holliday. Kate did not linger in Tombstone, she left almost immediately, believing the worst, as did others. The search for the bandits proved fruitless. After two weeks, the search posse returned to Tombstone emptyhanded. They had gone four days and a half without food and thirty-six hours without water. Tensions arose between Wyatt Earp and John Behan with Wyatt angered at Behan?s refusal to promote him as undersheriff and his refusal to pay Virgil and Morgan for their part in the search for the Benson stage robbery suspects. Wyatt?s friendship with Doc had made him the target of rumors of complicity and the gossip hurt the Earps. [Gary Roberts]: After the Benson stage robbery attempt, Wyatt Earp did something that was probably foolish in retrospect, he attempt to make a deal with Ike Clanton, one of the prominent cowboy leaders, to get Ike to turn in the three men that they were searching for for the Benson stage robbery attempt. It didn?t go well. In the first place because most of them well in fact all of them eventually ended up dead before a deal could be worked out which left them with a nasty little secret. [Narrator]: By midsummer of 1881, Doc had become infamous in Tombstone. By this time, he had legally been cleared of charges relating to the Benson stage robbery attempt and the murders of Bud Philpott and Peter Roerig. But suspicions remained. Many believed that regardless of what the district attorney and judge had said, Doc Holliday had been involved in attempted robbery. Wyatt Earp; however, stood by his friend. Though quiet and restrained when sober, Doc was quick-tempered and vocal when drinking and if he felt violated he was not afraid to seek redress at the point of a gun. He was healthier and stronger than he had been in years, the climate of southern Arizona benefitted him, even as he spent long hours in smoky saloons and gambling halls. He was associated in public mind with the Earps, but he had never been Wyatt?s lackey as legend would later portray him. He was jealous of his reputation and quick to brace anyone who impugned it. He was also, by all accounts, a fiercely loyal friend. So when Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury made their way into Tombstone, the weight of the secret between him and Wyatt sitting heavy on Ike?s shoulders, Doc spotted Ike in the lunchroom of the Alhambra Saloon and approached him. Earlier that week, Ike had accused Wyatt of telling Doc about the secret deal between them. Wyatt had confronted Doc, and Doc had promised to set things straight with Ike. An argument ensued and over the next few hours, tensions continued to escalate. [Gary Roberts]: Instead of arresting them as he probably should have, Virgil Earp as marshall just told them to go sleep it off. The next morning after a peculiar thing happened, and that is that Ike Clanton and Virgil Earp stayed up most of the night playing cards with each other in the same card game but the next morning, before Virgil or anybody else had gotten up, Ike Clanton is already walking the streets looking for the Earp brothers. [Narrator}: This is the beginning of what would become known as the OK Corral fight, which took place on the vacant lot near Fremont Street in Tombstone. The Earp brothers would catch up to Ike that morning and arrest him, he was fined and released. While leaving the court room, Wyatt ran into Tom McLaury and knocked him unconscious. Upon arriving in town, Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton encountered another Cowboy by the name of Billy Claibourne who told them about the arrest of Ike Clanton and the beating of Tom McLaury. Frank McLaury is reported to have said ?We?re going to have to resolve this.? [Gary Roberts]:They end up going to a gun shop, the people are spreading rumors all over town, telling the Earps they're down at the gun shop and so forth, there's a confrontation a near confrontation at the gun shop. Then the Earps go back up to what was known as Hatford?s Corner and they're standing there on the corner and the Clanton and McLaury?s walk by them you know kind of glaring at them. [Narrator]: Sherriff John Behan decided to intervene and set off to settle the situation. But word arrived that the Clantons and McLaurys had positioned themselves on a vacant lot on Fremont Street and the Earps decided that it was time to make the arrests. After his late breakfast, Doc had walked to the Alhambra Saloon to check on business. Morgan caught up with him there, filled him in on the situation, and walked with Doc to Hafford?s corner. An exchange took place between Doc and Wyatt which Wyatt later recounted. Wyatt said that he?d told Doc that this fight was none of his affair, to which Doc replied, ?Tha's a hell of a thing for you to say to me!? Wyatt may have further protested Doc?s involvement, but the matter was settled when Virgil handed Doc a shotgun, telling him to hide it under his overcoat. [Gary Roberts]: So they march up the street turn down Fremont and as they approach the vacant lot, square off and Virgil Earp with a cane in his hand throws up his hands and says, "Throw down your guns, I have come to arrest you." At that point, people start going for their guns and Virgil says, "No, I didn?t mean that!" But it?s too late and then explodes into what?s only about 30 seconds of gunfire. [Narrator]: Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury were struck by bullets and killed. Ike Clanton and Billy Claibourn both ran for it. Virgil Earp and Doc received minor injuries. Morgan Earp was struck by a bullet that chipped a vertebra, an injury from which he recovered. [Victoria Wilcox]: The story of the gunfight went out across the telegraph wires and hit all the newspapers in America and made instant celebrities of all the participants in a country that was enamored with all things wild west this was the most iconic Western battle of them all. [Gary Roberts]: The Earps take the position that they had gone down there to arrest them and that they had resisted arrest and that they were killed in the attempt to arrest them for wearing firearms on the streets of Tombstone which was clearly in violation of the law. The other side, including the sheriff, said that the Earps approached them and immediately opened fire and basically gunned them down. A coroner?s inquest that investigated it avoided coming to any conclusion other than the fact that these three men were killed by the Earp party. [Narrator]: As the country became fascinated by the story of the shootout, Ike Clanton sought to bring murder charges against Doc and the Earps. William R. McLaury, brother of Tom and Frank McLaury arrived in Tombstone from Texas determined to convict the Earps and Doc for the murders of his brothers. The Earps retained former Nevada congressman Thomas J. Fitch to lead the defense. At the end of the preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer ruled that there was insufficient reason to believe that the Earps and Doc had committed murder and that it did not matter who fired first, it was the expectation that was important and so he declared that there was no reason to indict? and the grand jury agreed with him. [Gary Roberts]: This is really the beginning of the Tombstone story, rather than the end because it's a climactic moment when from that point on the Cowboys and the Earps are really going after each other. [Narrator]: The fight divided the town and the Cowboys were determined to take matters into their own hands. In December 1881, Virgil Earp was shot walking down the street one night and as a result he was crippled for life. In January 1882 there was a near confrontation between Doc and a Cowboy Doc had encountered before by the name of John Ringo in the streets of Tombstone. Ike Clanton attempted once more to have the Earps and Doc arrested for the Tombstone fight but failed, which only served to further rile the Cowboys. Everything came to a head in March of 1882 when Morgan Earp was shot to death while playing pool in a billiard parlor, hailing the beginning of what has become known as the Vendetta Ride. Doc and Wyatt were inseparable at this time. Morgan Earp?s assassins had been identified as Deputy Sheriff Frank Stillwell, Peter Spence, Florentino ?Indian Charlie? Cruz, Frederic Bode and others. When Wyatt, his brothers, their wives and Doc travelled to Tucson to see Morgan?s body on the train to California, where the Earp parents lived, they spotted Frank Stillwell, chased him down, and shot him to death. [Gary Roberts]: This was the beginning of real trouble for the Earps and it made it clear that Wyatt was interested in more than just arresting people this had become personal. [Narrator]: When they returned to Tombstone, they found that warrants had been sworn out for Wyatt and Doc and a couple of others for having killed Frank Stillwell. [Gary Roberts]: He still has the support of some of the local businessmen, there?s a confrontation between him and Sheriff Behan in which Behan tries to arrest him and Wyatt just basically brushes him aside and leaves town. [Narrator]: Doc remained by Wyatt?s side as they actively pursued the Cowboys, with Florentino ?Indian Charlie? Cruz becoming yet another casualty of their vengeance. Shortly after that, they engaged in a shootout with Curly Bill Brosius in which Brosius was killed. [Gary Roberts]: After the Curly Bill episode the Earp posse decides it?s time to leave Arizona because of the pressure of the posses that are chasing them. With the assistance probably of two governors, Wells Fargo and Company, maybe the Santa Fe Railroad and the US Marshall?s office, they go to Alburquerque and from there into Colorado. It might have worked out except there had been a little dispute between Wyatt and Doc in Alburquerque they got into the first fight they?d really had and as a result of that fight, Doc left the rest of the Earps and went into Colorado before them. [Narrator]: The city of Pueblo lies in the high desert of Colorado at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek, along the front range of the Rocky Mountains. It began as a trappers? trading post in the early 19th century, on what was then the US/Mexican border, but it didn?t grow to anything like a town until the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859. Doc was looking for some entertainment and an escape from his trouble in Arizona. But trouble always seemed to follow Doc and this time it was named Perry Mallon. [Gary Roberts]: Mallon tried to make an impression on him, but Doc kind of brushed him aside as being of no significance. Instead Doc fell in with some of his gambling buddies and they headed to Denver. Doc seemed determined it?s time for him to have a good time, so he goes to Denver and is planning to go to the horse races, he?s on the train with Bat Masterson and some other guys that he knows, he gets to Denver and he meets some people there even introduces himself to the chief of police and a couple of other people, so he?s not trying to hide he said later that he was there to meet a mining man who had been in Tombstone and that they were going to get together and talk about some business matters. On his way back to the hotel one night, he was suddenly confronted by this man who jumped out of the shadows and put a pointed gun at him and told him to throw up his hands and it was this character from Pueblo, Perry Mallon. [Narrator]: This encounter made big news in Denver, Mallon became an instant celebrity, and it kept Doc in hand long enough for people in Arizona to find out his whereabouts. There was an immediate rush by both the Sheriff of Cochise County, John Behan and the Sheriff of Pima County, Bob Paul, to apply to have Doc returned to their respective jurisdictions. Behan wanted him for the murder of Francisco ?Indian Charlie? Cruz, Paul wanted him for the murder of Deputy Sheriff Frank Stillwell. Mallon eventually slipped out of town after being discredited, but not before the damage had been done. The case went all the way to the governor, Frederick W. Pitkin. [Gary Roberts]: All of a sudden, Doc has support coming out of the woodwork Bat Masterson comes to town and begins to argue for him, There was a newspaperman named E.D. Cowan who is working on his behalf, Doc has the services of one of the most expensive law firms in Denver, he has a major mining owner with some Tombstone connections by the name of Crummy who is advocating on his behalf. So all of these people are saying to the governor don?t send him back and so what happens is that the governor of Colorado looks over the papers and says that there are some problems with the paperwork I?m not going to grant the extradition. besides that to make sure it wasn?t going to happen, he said there is already a charge against Doc Holliday in Pueblo, and we can?t send him back to extradite him to another state, when there is an outstanding warrant against him here in Colorado. By the way, that?s called now in Colorado and other places, ?Hollidiaying?, The idea of using filing charges of one crime to prevent applying warrants for another crime. [Narrator]: Doc was taken back to Pueblo where the case against him was delayed continuously and never fully pursued. He was free to go. Perhaps with thoughts of forgiveness and reconciliation, after Masterson and others had come to his defense, Doc headed to Gunnison where he sat for probably the last time with his old friend, Wyatt Earp. The two men mended fences, but the closeness of their friendship was over and they went their separate ways. At an elevation of over 10,000 feet, Leadville is the highest incorporated city in the United States. Situated near the headwaters of the Arkansas River in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Leadville in Doc?s time had a population of 40,000 and hopes of replacing Denver as the capitol of Colorado. Doc arrived in Leadville in 1883. He became a temporary member of the Leadville Fire Department when a building down the street caught fire and he was pressed into service to help douse the blaze. The local paper, the Leadville Democrat, thanked him for his valiant efforts. Doc enjoyed the sporting life at most of the drinking and gaming establishments in town. He moved in the right social circles, and was interviewed by all sorts. It is in Leadville that his fame becomes legendary. It was at Manny Hyman?s Saloon, a block down from the Opera House, where he spent most of his time and where he encountered some men from his past. Doc?s health had started to deteriorate, his body had begun to tremble from the effects of his hard living, and perhaps most dangerous of all, he had once again encountered Johnny Tyler and Billy Allen. [Gary Roberts]: What happens is that he owes a little money to Billy Allen and Allen wants to collect it and he threatens Doc that if he does not pay then he?s going to find him and shoot him or beat him up. Doc gets frantic about this and he goes to a saloon and positions himself near the door, hides the pistol close by and he talks to policemen he tells everybody he was wanting to avoid trouble. but when Billy Allen walks into the saloon Doc reaches over and grabs a pistol and shoots him now he does not kill him, he wounds him. [Narrator]: Billy Allen insisted on pressing charges and the case was brought to trial. Doc was acquitted, but his illness had taken its toll. He wasn?t on the run this time, but he was in desperate need of a more hospitable climate. [Victoria Wilcox]: According to an old story out of Doc's hometown of Valdosta, after leaving Leadville, he took a train trip far away from his troubles out west and back into southern territory. The ocassion was a reunion of Mexican War veterans, at the Cotton States Exposition in New Orleans. Where he had a reunion of his own, with his father, Henry Holliday. [Narrator]: Henry tried to get his son to return to Georgia, but Doc refused and returned to Colorado. By 1886, he was worn out from illness and alcohol, and headed for one more mountain springs resort to seek a cure: Glenwood Springs, high in the Rocky Mountains. To get there, he had to take the train back to Leadville, where he bought a bottle of laudanum from a local pharmacist, before daring a stage coach ride over the Independence Pass. The pass was only open in the summer months, and even then the road was treacherous. But there was no other way to reach Glenwood Springs. He checked into the Hotel Glenwood, a modern resort that boasted electric lights and running water in private baths and the convenience of a doctor and nurse on staff for ailing guests. It wasn?t the comfort of a hotel he had come for, but the heat of the sulfur vapors in the caves. But Doc Holliday was beyond saving. The illness that had taken his mother had finally caught up with him. Returning from the caves, he was bed-ridden for thirty-three days and able to only get up twice. For two weeks after that, he was delirious, and slipped in and out of a coma. For twenty-four hours before his death, he did not speak. John Henry Holliday died at ten o?clock in the morning on Monday, November 8, 1887. Reverend W.S. Rudolph delivered the eulogy, and Doc?s body was buried at four o?clock that afternoon in Linwood Cemetery on a high bluff overlooking Glenwood Springs. Expenses for the funeral were paid from a collection taken up among the gamblers, saloonmen and other locals who had come to know Doc during those last months. [Gary Roberts]: John Clum, the editor of the Tombstone Epitaph and a friend of Wyatt Earp?s said that Doc Holliday was not a constructive citizen, and that?s probably a fair assessment, he had a difficult life and there are many qualities that he had that would cause you to arrive at that conclusion. Bat Masterson says in one place that he didn?t like him very much yet he spent a lot of time with him and had some more positive things to say about him too. Wyatt Earp always emphasized his loyalty and his friendship and his ability with a gun and he talked about him being at his side during all of those days. [Narrator]: He had lived a full life, loved and been loved. It is unlikely that any of his family or friends were with him when he died. His relationship with Kate Elder is one of the most perplexing parts of his life and legend. Little information on their life together survives. Kate claimed that they were married, and there does exist some evidence to suggest that this may have been the case. But, Doc left not a word about her and Kate?s accounts later in life were self-serving and defensive, confused by fading memories. She defended Doc against charges that he was a killer and a drunkard, There was no romance in the story she told about her life with Doc. She expressed resentment towards him, accusing him of gambling away her money. Kate died on November 2, 1940, and was buried in Pioneer Cemetery in Prescott, Arizona. At the time of Doc?s death, the Glenwood Springs Ute Chief noted, ?He only had one correspondent among his relatives-- a cousin, a Sister of Charity, in Atlanta, Georgia. She will be notified of his death.? At the time of Mattie?s death in 1939, she was known as Sister Mary Melanie and had been a nun for most of her life. Her family held her in high esteem and publicly disavowed any suggestion that she and Doc had been in love. But they never denied that she and Doc had been close, with one relative recalling that after Doc?s death, ?Mattie would talk of him and say that if only people had known him as she had, they would have seen a different man from the one of Western fame.? [Gary Roberts]: Doc was a mass of contradictions, he could be charming and smooth, he could be nasty and downright brutal. He drank too much, he could be pathetic and pitiful at times, and you feel when you read the old documents and what people say about him, and you feel genuine pity for him as an individual. But he is still the dominant personality in the story. If you think about it, and you go to see movies about all of this, the character who wins in the movies, everytime, who puts Wyatt Earp in the shadows, although he's supposed to be the hero, you forget about Wyatt Earp and you concentrate on Doc Holliday. [Victoria Wilcox]: He?d done more in 36 years than most men ever dream of doing, he'd traveled across the country and seen history being made and he had become part of American history. [Narrator]: Mystery surrounds the true resting place of John Henry Holliday, with some questioning whether his family would have left his remains in a place far away from his southern roots. There are two unmarked graves under a tree in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Griffin, Georgia that are said to belong to Doc Holliday and his father, Henry Burroughs Holliday. And though it may never be proven, there are many who would like to believe that Doc?s final resting place is deep in the soil of Griffin. For all his travels, various exploits and western fame, John Henry ?Doc? Holliday was a son of the south.
