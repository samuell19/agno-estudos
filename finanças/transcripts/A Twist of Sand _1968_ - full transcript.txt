[SHIP HORN BLOWING] That's him. Send the message.Sir. Signal from the other boat, Sir. The Etoshahas just passed. Well. Slow ahead both... Fifteen degrees starboard. [ALARM RINGING] [INAUDIBLE] Slow ahead both engines. [ENGINE REVVING] Up the starboard, both engines. Give him a burst, gunner. [GUNFIRE] Hard to starboard. Can't we swing across his path and cut him off, Sir? No, he's got behind a sandbank. We'll have to follow him. [GEAR CLICKS] That little lot would have brought us £6,000 in Cyprus. Hope you enjoyed chucking it overboard. I thought I did rather well considering the short notice. You know one of these days you're gonna cut things just a bit too fine. Well, I thought you'll be around to pull this out. Captain Peace. Glad to see you came so well prepared, Commander. I have a warrant from the flag officer of Malta to search your vessel. Mr. Garland, show our guests aboard. Gentlemen, this way. If you'll please. GEOFFREY: What else can I do for you, Commander? Captain. You're charged with violating the Smuggling and Contraband Act. And that charge is not to be uh, taken lightly. Also requires evidence. Well, I assume that you were jettisoned your entire cargo. And what cargo is that? [CHUCKLES] We're informed that you're carrying 100 automatic weapons, an unspecified number of rifles and four cases of ammunition. Destination, Cyprus. Really? And who told you that? I could send divers down to get those crates you know. Well, I'm sure you'll find all kinds of things in the bottom of the sea. Yes, I'm sure I should. I'm well aware of the fact that I can't prove that those guns came from this ship. And you may think you're making fools of us, Captain, but all you're doing is degrading yourselves. Submarine Officer, Distinguished Service Cross 1943, D.S.O. and Bar, 1944... Yes, court-martialed and dismissed of service, 1945. I'm sure you'll find that down the bottom of the page. It is. You know I spent the war in the Mediterranean, I remember you, then. You commanded for Trout,didn't you? No, I was just a paid hand commander. £900 a year for seeking out and killing whoever was supposed to be the enemy at the time. Well, some of us joined up for other motives. Pity we all can't be so lucky, isn't it? Well? Nothing in the cabins, Sir and both holds are empty. All right, Lieutenant, carry on. Very good, Sir. You know, the Admiralty take a pretty dim view of former naval persons running contraband, especially in the Mediterranean. You know there are some rather nasty jails in some of these countries. Well, it's awfully decent of you to be so concerned about our welfare. Entirely sincere. Commander. [SHIP ENGINE REVVING] Well, now that we're dead broke, back to port. Back to port. [SIREN WAILING] [CAR HONKS] You have to use this entrance, Sir, since, the fronts been bombed. Ah.Enjoy your leave, Sir. [CHUCKLES] Oh, well, I never enjoy leave. Hello, Paddy, I thought you'd been appointed to London. Hello, Geoff. Good to see you. I was. I was going to look you up there, except my travel order seems to have got lost in somebodies debt. Let me buy you a drink. No.It's rather important. Well, I've made some arrangements and I haven't even checked into the hotel. The hotel and the young lady have been taken care of. This way, Sir. PADDY: Sorry they changed your plans like this I suppose it's rather confusing. Is there some sort of explanation? Or am I just supposed to be amused? Yes, I understand exactly how you feel. First they order you to London and cancel it and now this. But there is a reason for it.Oh, that's reassuring. [DRILL SHOUTS IN BACKGROUND] [CLEARS THROAT] There's nothing quite like the Mediterranean sun, is there? Beautifully enervating. Turns a man into a complete idiot. Unless of course, you're born to the climate. Besides, the weather's dreadful in London. Thought I'd save you the trip. You did mention something about there being a reason for my being brought here. What Lieutenant Commander Peace means... What Lieutenant Commander Peace means is that he's tired and irritable. GEOFFREY: I didn't request this leave. If it's being canceled, I'll return to my ship. You will Lieutenant Commander, indeed you will. This is Admiral Sir Lieutenant Tringham. Director of Naval Intelligence. I'm not his Uncle Bertie after all. Something no doubt you are beginning to suspect. It had crossed my mind, Sir. Shall we walk a bit? Splendid view. I suppose you've seen it before. According to our reports, you carried out a most unusual mission this past week. Against the advice of your intelligence liaison and with your fuel dangerously low, you've entered the Bay of Naples and carried out an attack, an unauthorized attack on an enemy battleship. Why? It seemed to be worth the risk, Sir. And you succeeded, fortunately for you. Otherwise you'd have been up against an official reprimand. Otherwise I'd have been at the bottom of the sea, Sir. And I wouldn't have had to bother about a reprimand. No, I suppose you wouldn't. Worth the risk? That's an interesting locking contraption. Shall we try it? Do you think this would be worth the risk, Peace? It's an entirely new and devastatingly efficient U-boat developed by Blohm and Voss. The Germans call it N P-1. NP-1.PADDY: One. It's the only one of its kind, so far. It has to be the last. The war at sea depends on it. You notice he didn't say, "May depend on it." Depends on it. PADDY: The NP-1 carries 18 homing acoustic torpedoes. She's equipped with a new type range finder well in advance of us or the Americans which enables her to fire those torpedoes from a depth of 50 meters without using a periscope at all. TRINGHAM: What's more, the Germans have come up with a rather revolutionary system of propulsion. What speed does your sub do? She might make a single burst of nine knots in emergency. The NP-1can do 22 knots submerged. 22 knots! That means that she can outrun any of the ordinary escort ships in the North Atlantic underwater. And to make it worse, the damn thing is virtually silent. At least, it doesn't sound like anything we've ever heard. So, Lieutenant Commander, all I'm asking you to do is to find it... [LIFT DESCENDS] ...and kill it. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] What an extraordinary mixture. Look at those faces, and you can see the signs of every conquering horde to have crossed the Mediterranean. Doesn't that sound unbelievable? The 22 knots, I mean. Of course it does. Fortunately, the German High Command agree. They think it's bound to blow up sooner or later. Blohm and Voss disagree. So, the NP-1has been sent on a long try out cruise at the South Atlantic, operating out of a hidden anchorage in South-West Africa... One of the most dangerous coasts in the world. The Skeleton Coast. That's 500 miles of reef and shore. There's no way into it, much less an anchorage. So we thought... ...till the Germans found one. If the NP-1should return successfully from his crewing trip, the Germans will start mass producing it's type. But, if it fails to return with no hint of what happened to it, they might assume that it's blown up or sunk from malfunction, and abandon the project. You must make sure that it does not return and that nobody learns what happens to it. Well, even if I find this NP-1, how am I supposed to catch her? 22 knots!Precisely. You could never catch her. So, as a more practical approach, you're to find her hidden anchorage, and attack the NP-1 in its mooring. If it exists. It exists. You'll have complete access to Naval Intelligence reports and every scrap of information we've been able to assemble. Even so... We have no illusions about the odds confronting you. But we do have to try, don't we? PADDY: Sealed orders will route you through South Atlantic command to Cape Town. Neither your crew nor your officers are to know where you're going or why. Well, that's an extraordinary requirement, Sir. TRINGHAM: It can't be helped. If German Intelligence learns that the NP-1'sattacked, the whole purpose of your mission will be lost. They'll simply build another, and after that, a 100 more. Attacking a U-boat in its mooring, not on the high seas, bound to be survivors. You think that German Intelligence is smart enough to pick up a leak from my crew? What happens when I sail into port with a whole bagful of German prisoners? That will not happen. [CHUCKLES] There'll be no prisoners. You can't guarantee that. You will guarantee it. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] There can be no survivors, Commander. Is that quite clear? No survivors. [INAUDIBLE] Well... I suppose we could look around for some passengers for a cruise. DAVID: Just a stray thought. God bless. Take us two more years of running for others, before we can afford another load of our own. Is it possible, Geoffrey? The game is becoming too risky for the price. Maybe. Look, if you want to sign off at this point, you can, you know. Nothing else I care to do. No place else I care to go. [CLATTERING] [ALARM BUZZING] MAN: Permission to come aboard, Skipper? Very smart vessel. Radar, echo sounder, 800 horse-power engines for Davey to play with... Not quite up to your submarine,Trout, but very smart. [PHONE CLICKS] Lieutenant Riker reporting, Sir. Hello, Harry. Long time no see. Well... Isn't this cozy, the three of us back together again? You haven't changed a bit, Davey. You're not looking too well, yourself.Ah! And still the same old game. Yes, chess was always a bit beyond you, wasn't it? Beyond my interest. Mind if I have a drink? Why the visit, Harry? Oh, what you might call a condolence call. Good whiskey. [POURING DRINK] News travels fast. Only if you're in the right place to listen. Your own money, wasn't it? Must have hurt. Still, life is a vale of tears, and by the sweat of our brow must we earn our bread. Except it's... I have a better idea. Anything like that idea of yours I read about in the newspaper a few years back? Something about, um... You and your Skipper scuttling a coaster for the insurance money? Anyway, when did you get out of prison? A few months ago. GEOFFREY: Courts must be slipping. I thought they got you for life. Oh, the evidence was only circumstantial. Besides, they took my war record into consideration. Don't forget my record was honorable... At least as honorable as yours, Commander. You mean they never caught you. Oh, you've been in the newspapers too, Davey. I suppose that's what sent you scuttling back to Papa here. It must have been very unpleasant for that distinguished family of yours, all that scandal. What a nasty thing, a wife like that. That's enough, Harry. You know, uh... I wasn't too surprised to learn what you were doing now. For some of us, the war is never over. We become addicted, it's uh, a way of life... GEOFFREY: What do you want, Harry? I want to make you a rich man, Skipper, a very rich man. There, it's yours. A token of good faith. About what you must have paid for that unfortunate cargo of yours. GEOFFREY: I never knew you to be so thoughtful. Nothings more important than an old friend, Skipper. Besides, I'll get most of it back from Malta for having informed on you. So, it was you! You bastard![BOTTLE SHATTERS] [BOTH GRUNT] Please, don't consider it. [DAVID GROANS] Johann, my associate. You've acquired some charming companions since the war. Johann is a man of many talents. You'd be surprised how often he comes in handy. Oh, it's not like you, Davey, losing your temper like that. There was no reason for it. You didn't really think I sent you to quod to... No, I knew they'd never catch you, Skipper, not peacetime Navy. You knew we'd have to dump our cargo there? That's right. I wanted you to need the money enough to listen to what I have to say. All right, Johann, put the knife away, we're amongst friends. Well, how much did you lose today? Five, six thousand pounds? I'm here to talk about half a million pounds for each of us. Half a million quid, Skipper, just think about it. Go on. All you have to do is take this ship down to South-West Africa, and into the Skeleton Coast. Nothing you haven't done before. You never knew that's where we went on the Trout's last mission, did you, Davey? No one was supposed to know. I didn't know then, not till much later. But, uh, that doesn't matter now. All that matter now is that you are the only man alive who knows how to get ashore inside the Skeleton Coast. For what purpose? A pursuit of a very large tin can... Filled with diamonds. Where'd you get these? They, uh, they belonged to a geologist named Eric Sorel. He worked for a mining syndicate in South-West Africa, searching for new diggings northwest of Damara. They, uh, they take rather elaborate precautions to keep the stones from being slipped out of the diamond area. Electric fences... X-rays, land and air patrols, but... Because of his work, Sorel had complete freedom of movement inside the areas, so every time he left an operating field, he took a few stones with him. After a couple of years he had quite a collection. The problem was getting them out. The first time he tried, he was lucky. The second time, five years in prison. GEOFFREY: Well, have you met him? Well, as luck would have it... We, uh, formed a partnership to get the diamonds out. Where's he now? Dead. No, not what you think, David. Bad bump. Glad to see you're taking it so well. There. The diamonds are on the edge of the Kaokoveld, that's 200 miles south of Ventnor Bay. Nothing but uninhabited desert barren mountains and the diamond security patrols cover the whole area. No one can get in or out, except by sea. But surely they must patrol the coast. The Skeleton Coast polices itself. Five hundred miles of reefs and shoals. No ship has ever survived it, expect for the Trout. That was a long time ago. And no reason why you shouldn't do it again. And this time for half a million pounds. Unless, uh... Unless you have some private reasons for not going back. Where exactly is this tin can? HARRY: One step at a time. You made me sweat for that one. [ENGINE REVVING] Slow ahead both engines. I'll take her out of the harbor from up top. Ah, she's all yours, Skipper. [LAUGHING] GEOFFREY: What the hell are you doing here? Captain Geoffrey Peace? Who the hell are you? Julie Chambois. Perhaps we should meet again when you are in a better mood. This is my better mood. Then I suppose I shall have to get used to it. Don't worry, you're not staying. I see you two have met. Forget it, Harry, you're not bringing your home comforts. There's a bit more to it than that. I'm not having your bloody woman on my ship! I'm not his woman, Captain. Worse luck. I don't know what the game is, but it's not on. Told you he wouldn't like it. JULIE: I'm your partner, Captain. And as I had no choice about you, you have no choice about me. We'll see about that. I'm afraid you have no alternative, Skipper. You see, Sorel never told me the exact location of the diamonds. She's the only one who knows and she's not telling. Not until we get there. Sorel's woman. JULIE: Sorel is dead. HARRY: I tried to persuade her to stay behind and wait for her share, but for some reason she doesn't seem to trust me. Maybe she'll trust you. The only one who knows where the diamonds are, and the only one who knows how to get near them. [LAUGHING] I'm a smashing matchmaker, I am. [GEAR CLICKS] Get out! [SHIP ALARM RINGING] Steer 3-4-O. Aye, aye, Skipper. 3-4-O. Steady she goes. HARRY: Just like old times. GEOFFREY: Old times... Five fathoms... Four and a half. Steer 3-4-O.MAN: Steer Three-Four-O, Sir. [GRUNTS] Engine room to Captain... Damage repaired, Sir. If these currents keep hitting...Give me a sounding. Sweep all around, please. Three. Thirty. Take her down, number one. Half ahead both engines. Half astern both engines. MAN: Half astern both engines. Stop engines. MAN: Stop engines. Assume silent routine. ELTON: Blimey... Well, how long's he gonna sit down here. And for what? I mean, what are we after? Shut up, Elton. [DOOR OPENS]Sonar report, Skipper? That happens to be against regulations. I'm supposed to be your navigating officer. You can report me when we get to the Cape. If we get to the Cape. Mmm? You're supposed to be giving me a sonar report. We're practically surrounded by echoes, none of them moving. That is what we're waiting for down here, isn't it? Something moving. I'm waiting for a target, number one. I didn't mind your past tendencies towards glory hunting. At least at the other times I knew where we were and what you were risking my life for. Sir, we're going to have to surface to recharge the batteries soon. How soon?An hour, no more. We'll wait till then?For what? That'll be all. Well, Geoff, I'm sure you know what you're doing, but... GEOFFREY: That's right. A hydrophone effect bearing 108 degrees, Sir. Closing fast. Action stations. MAN: Fast hydrophone effect closing bearing 205. What is it? Very fast H.E, Sir. 350 revs and engine noises. Could it be a surface ship? No, Sir, she's at about 180 feet. I've never heard of anything like it. She's doing about 20 knots. Could be a whale with a belly-ache? Switch off all auxiliaries. Absolute silence. No movement in boat. Anybody drops anything, he'll be in my report. Stand by to surface. Check main vents. [THUD]MAN: All main vents checked up, Sir. Surface. Blow twos and fours. [ENGINE REVVING] All right, number one. Switch off echo sounders, and call up continuous soundings. I'll take over from the bridge. Alone, Sir? MAN: Thirty five. Hard a' port.MAN: Hard a' port, Sir. Thirty. MAN: Twenty seven. Group down.Group down, Sir. Slow ahead together. Slow ahead together, Sir. Twenty one.Starboard 10 degrees. Starboard 10 degrees, Sir. MAN: Fifteen. Fourteen. Ten.Stand by three and four tubes. MAN: Eight. Three and four tubes ready, Sir. GEOFFREY: Set 10 and 12 depth settings. MAN: Ay, ay, Sir, MAN: Five. Fire three. [TORPEDO FIRED] Fire four. [EXPLOSION] [GEAR CLICKS] MAN: Was ist das? [EXPLOSION] [MEN SCREAMING] [MAN SCREAMING] [MAN SCREAMING] Put us down! Both engines. You should have gone back years ago. If that's where your ghost lives. [POURING DRINK] I haven't got any ghosts. We all have ghosts. Of one shape or another. You never told me what happened. God bless. Nothing happened. You're an early riser. The sea disrupted my schedule. I suppose you know the odds against... Two years if we're caught in the prohibited area. Five, if we're found with the diamonds. I mean the odds against surviving. Captain Peace, I know why it is called the Skeleton Coast, but you have been there before and you survived. It doesn't mean to say I can do it again. I think you can, if you want to. Why shouldn't I want to? I don't know. You know the risks. You didn't have to come. I prefer to take the risks. Why? Life belongs to those who can pay for it. Or find somebody to pay for them. Perhaps. Like Sorel? Sorel is dead, Captain. And dead men are history. Nothing more? Nothing more, and sometimes history is best forgotten. You seem to forget easily. Do I? And what about you, Lieutenant Commander Peace? [DOOR OPENS] HARRY: Ah! Glad to see you two in such fine spirits. Why shouldn't you be with £1,500,000 worth of diamonds waiting for us? [ENGINE REVVING] DAVID: Is that intake valve tight? Any leakage? Okay. Now fix the other one. Johann, here... Hey, Joh...Ah! What the hell's the matter with you? Johann! Now back off! You bloody great idiot! Now then... Now, you come one step nearer and I'll bash your head in! [ALARM BUZZING] Having a nice chat? DAVID: It's a bit one sided. HARRY: Put the knife away, Johann. Very funny, Harry. Aren't you happy with your crew? What? That lunatic? Who needs him? HARRY: As a matter of fact, we do. Apart from the fact he's a first rate mechanic, he's spent years in South-West Africa. Knows the country like the back of his hand, or so he says. You should hear some of the stories he told in the bars around Cape town. Stories? What stories? Ask him. DAVID: Ask him? That lunatic never talks! Good morning. Inspector Seekert. Diamond Security Police. Oh, what's the problem? A slight confusion, Captain, about your intentions. The harbor master's got my papers. Yes. Well? I thought, perhaps you might be unaware that you're on the edge of the Kaokoveld prohibited area. Yes, I know. So? Your papers say that you are taking a passenger to Cape Town. But your first mate tells me that you're going there for cargo. Well, if we get some, it'll help pay for the return trip. And if not?Have to come back empty, won't we? Then I shall look forward to see you again, Captain, should you stop here on your return. Of course I shall notify Cape Town of your arrival. They will be expecting you. Thank you. Not at all, Captain. Good day. Uh-huh. You've really done it this time, Harry. Why the hell did you say we're going to Cape Town for cargo? We're supposed to be carrying passengers! Well, how the hell was I to know what you put in your damn papers! Well, if you don't know, why don't you keep your mouth shut? He probably thinks he's scared us off anyway. You better hope so! You better bloody well hope so, Harry! Lousy Cape Brandy. [WHISTLING A TUNE] [SINGING IN GERMAN] [CHUCKLES] That's right, Johann, you remember. Pretty soon you'll remember everything. [DRUMS PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] May I talk to you? Under a flag of truce? Why not? [INDISTINCT LAUGHTER] Tell me, if Sorel had lived how was he going to get the diamonds out? He didn't know. Probably in his pocket, that's how he was caught. Not very clever. Not clever at all. He was a foolish man, I suppose. With expensive dreams. Cost him his life. The dreams didn't kill him, Captain, that was my privilege. Riker said he died in prison. [MAN PLAYING FLUTE] Sorel used to talk about being rich. It was like a game we played. He was going to buy a villa in Capri, with a terrace overlooking the sea. The walls would be white to catch the sunset and glazed with Vietri tiles on the floor. Oh, he described it often, and that was only the beginning. Did you believe him? No. I knew nothing about the diamonds until he brought the first ones out. Soon there would be millions, he said, and everything he promised would come true. But, unlike us, Captain, he was much too innocent to be a thief. He had no guile, and so he was caught. In prison, he knew he was dying, so he made his deal with Riker. Then how are you responsible? Because he only stole for me, and because I didn't stop him. Did you love him? He was my husband. Where we are going, is it very dangerous? Yes. You and me, David and Johann, even Riker. It would solve a great many problems if we all drowned, wouldn't it? [ENGINE REVVING] Not very friendly... Your Skeleton Coast. GEOFFREY: This is only the beginning. It gets a damn sight worse. I'll consider myself forewarned. Sorel once told me this may be the oldest coast in the world. That perhaps it was here that earth first emerged from chaos. We'll probably return it to its original condition one of these days. The first time you were here, it was a long time ago? Oh, have I broken the truce, Captain? Four years ago a trawler broke on the shoals. You can still see it. In land about 500 yards. That's where it went aground. The shoreline's shifted since then. JULIE: The coast that walks. Do you think the sand will cover it? Maybe, someday. Does it worry you? Why should it? Any number of wrecks along this coast... One more or less wouldn't make any difference. Unless it happened to be the one we were looking for. My compliments, Captain. No, not deserved. Nowhere else Sorel could have hidden the diamonds. Not if he wanted to find them again? The wreck is about three miles in land. The question is, where inside the wreck? And the answer? I'm almost tempted to tell you. [CHUCKLES] GEOFFREY: We start in here, the Swallow Breakers, an opening in the reefs. The HMS Swallow found a passage in 1879 and then, she broke her back on these shoals here. All hands lost. Hmm, that's encouraging. In uh, 1891, the British whaler, Clan Alpine found the Swallow's path through the Breakers and slipped past the shoals. Then doing 21 and a half feet, she was finally ripped open by a projecting ridge here. We have to get through these two rows of exposed reefs and into the lagoon there. [WAVES SPLASHING] Well, I suppose that getting there is half the fun. Good morning. Has it been like this all night? Just for the past few hours. It shouldn't last much longer. I hope not, I prefer to see where I'm going. You'll get used to it. You can get used to anything, but it's not always an improvement. One way to stay alive. Adapt or die. Is that your motto, Captain? Survive. Except, one can adapt too well. Like a species of beetle Sorel once told me about. This species of beetle is blind. Oh, it once had eyes like any other beetle, until one day the wind blew it into the desert. In order to survive, it had to burrow deep under the sand, out of the sun. It now has completely adapted to its environment. But it is quite blind as a result. Not a very interesting story. Then why tell me? Purely in the interests of science. [HARRY YAWNS] My watch. Your watch 20 minutes ago. Put it on my reports, Sir. Oh, bloody fog! HARRY: How long have we been sailing this close to shore? Three hours. We're in the down coast current. Oh, 30 fathoms under us, that's some comfort. Steer 1-0-5 degrees.1-0-5. A few minutes before noon, fog ought to have lifted enough for us to get a sight of a high hill on the shore line. Pretty soon after that we ought to see some white water ahead. Not exactly a reliable bearing. That's the best I've got. I knew you two would get along. Cigarette? Any minute now, by dead reckoning. Dead being the operative word. Skipper! There's your hill. How much water under this? Uh, 12 and a half and shoaling. The Swallow Breakers. Have we really got to go through that? Stand by the engine room telegraph. Full ahead, both engines! [ALARM RINGING] [ENGINE REVVING] [GEOFFREY MUTTERS] Soundings. HARRY: Fifteen... 18 and a half. Twenty. Thirty one. [ALARM RINGING] Full ahead, both engines! Five... Fifteen. 18 and a half... Twenty. Full astern, port engine, full ahead starboard engine. [JULIE SCREAMS]Get out! Oh! [CRASHING] Find out what the hell happened! HARRY: The lifeboat's hanging by one davit! Well, cut the bloody thing loose before it drives us on the rocks! [CRASHING] [JULIE SCREAMS] [PANTING] Half ahead both engines. [ENGINE SWITCHES OFF] Curva dos Dunas. The Twist of Sand. That's right, Skipper, I saw your chart in the Trout,only... I didn't know where we were then. And now it's just a 24 hour walk to the diamonds. Ever hear of a better way to annihilate a submarine? Just turn it into an oven and cook everyone inside. [MEN SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] Now he's shooting. Well, he's crazy, that's what he is. [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] What did we get? Nothing. Then what were you firing at? ELTON: I tell you, he's bleeding crazy! I tell you, he'll kill the lot of us. [ELTON GROANS] ELTON: No, Sir! Herr Kapitan! Well, he'll be okay. That's right, Skipper. Johann survived. God knows how. The stories he told were so wild, no one believed him. But I did because of one thing he remembered. The cocked fist on the Trout'sconning tower. Once I believed him, I knew where you'd taken the Troutand why. [YELLS] Then why the hell did you bring him back here? He's the only one who knows what it's like in there. The only one alive, at any rate. Come on, Davey, give us a hand. We don't have to take him with us. Sorel told me exactly where it is. Maybe he did. But Johann's the only one whose seen the wreck, and he's the only one whose got a chance of leading us there. Davey. Don't worry, Skipper. He doesn't know who you are. Riker never told me about Johann, or about what happened here. I want you to know that. Why? Make any difference? No, not to me. Not to me either. So you can spare yourself the concern. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Feeling better? You're not alone this time, Johann. I'll take care of you. Come on, get your things. [INDISTINCT CLANKING] Oh! [WHISTLING A TUNE] [JOHANN HUMMING] If he finds out who you are, he'll try to kill you. [CHUCKLES] Well, I tried to kill him. [GUNSHOT] [BIRD SCREECHING] [COCKS RIFLE] [SIGHS] Ah, these dunes are like quick sand. Even if we start at dawn, we're not gonna make it before noon. If the wind gets up, we may not make it at all. [CHUCKLES] [JOHANN CHUCKLES] [PANTING] Well, right now I'd trade my share for a large Scotch... On the rocks. Where is it? In the rope locker of the bow anchor. What a bloody good that's going to do us! JULIE: It's where Sorel told me to look. Take months to shift this lot! DAVID: When Sorel planted the diamonds here, the whole ship must have been uncovered. Or maybe... But the winds had six years to cover it up. We might be able to work our way forward, from the inside. [WOOD CREAKING] [SCREAMS] The whole ship is about to crack. [GROANS][RATTLING] HARRY: Let's try in there! Careful, careful. [WOOD CREAKING] [SAND TRICKLING] David. [WOOD CREAKING] [CRASHING] It looks like, uh... The rope locker must be under this lot. The bow is all twisted out of shape. After coming this far... Ah, you give up too easily. Get out! [CREAKING] [EXHALES] David, go on. HARRY: I hope that all that timber doesn't come through. [STRAINING] [CRASHING] [RATTLING] [PANTING] Well, I hope that Sorel didn't have a sense of humor. [SIGHS] [SAND TRICKLING] DAVID: Hey, let's have the bloody light. HARRY: Oh, sorry. [DAVID PANTING] [METALLIC THUD] [METAL CLINKING] [CRASHING] Look out! [JOHANN SCREAMS] GEOFFREY: Johann! [HEAVY BREATHING] I was just about to bring it through and... Everything collapsed. Where's David? [JOHANN GROANS]Give me that! [JOHANN GROANS] GEOFFREY: David? It's funny. I expected to feel excited or something. Ah, you lack imagination. Here, just loot at 'em, Skipper, look at 'em. We'd better get started. Sorry about Davey, Skipper. Lousy break. In a couple of seconds, he'd have been out of there. Oh, dammit, stop acting as if I killed him! Did you? If I say no, you won't believe me. HARRY: Time to go, Johann. Hey... Come on. He'll never make it. We can't leave him here. What do you suggest? We can't carry him back. Johann! Johann! Look at me. Look at me! And do you remember me? I burned your U-boat. I shot your friends. The water was on fire. I left you all alone to die, don't you remember? [GROANS] Yes... I remember you, Johann. You were on your knees begging me to take you with me. [PANTING] [GROANS] Now, if you want to kill me, you've got to catch me. You've picked one hell of a time to become a saint. Go on then! You haven't got a chance. GEOFFREY: Come on, Johann! Come on! Catch me! [JOHANN PANTING] GEOFFREY: If you want to kill me, you've got to catch me. Come on! Come on! Catch me! Come on, Johann! Come on, Johann! Catch me! [JOHANN PANTING] [GROANS] GEOFFREY: Johann! Johann! HARRY: Hey, come along. Leave him or we'll all die! You've exorcised your ghost, you've... Atoned or whatever the hell it is you're trying to do... Get out of it! Come on! [JOHANN GROANING] You're not gonna die now. Come on! Get up! Damn you! Come on! Come on! [JOHANN GROANS] [WIND HOWLING] The whole pocket's gonna fill up soon. We've got to keep going. GEOFFREY: Soon. No, now. Are you coming? Johann! Come on! Come on! There it is! [LAUGHS] There it is! [LAUGHS] We're here! I knew I wasn't going to die. I knew it. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph... [COUGHS] [CHUCKLES] So close now. Give me a hand. Ah, might as well carry a corpse! [HARRY LAUGHING] I did it, Skipper! Me! If it hadn't been for me you'd have still been in there! I led you out, remember? Help me get him down. HARRY: I don't want him. He's all yours. [HARRY CHUCKLES] [STRAINING] Come on, the last effort. Well, the diamonds are here all right, don't worry. You don't think I was going to lose them. [GASPING] You wasted your noble gesture. All for nothing. Look at him. He's dying.He'll live. For a few hours. No point in taking him with us just to bury him at sea. Why don't you, er... Put him out of his misery?Put that thing away! [JOHANN GASPS][GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] You were a great teacher, Skipper, but you forgot your own first lesson. The strong survive, the weak die. Cling to the weak and you'll die with them. [GASPS] Johann! TRINGHAM: There can be no survivors, Commander. No survivors! GEOFFREY: Fire three![GUNFIRE] Fire four![GUNFIRE] ELTON: I tell you, he'll kill the lot of us! [MUFFLED SCREAMS] Herr Kapitan! [GUNFIRE] [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] [SHRIEKS] No! Oh! Johann! Gone! [MUTTERS] It's over now. [SOBS] They're gone. [SOBS]
