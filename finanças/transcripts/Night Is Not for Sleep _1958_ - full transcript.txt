- Please, sir. - Yes ? Is it the road to Nice ? Let me see... Yeah, just go straight ahead. Can I drop you off somewhere ? Where are you going ? - Nowhere, I'm just walking-around. - I take you there. Hop in. Come on, hop in. Hey, you're on the wrong road: Nice was straight ahead. I beg you pardon but where are you taking me ? Nowhere... That's where you wanted to go, isn't it ? So that's why we're here. Get off now. - What ? - I told you to get off. - Hey, we've got plenty of time. - No, I'm in a hurry. - You didn't look in a hurry just before. - Maybe but now I am ! - What's the hell ? - Are you getting off ? Cut it. Where's the light ? I want to see who you are. You're crazy ! You should see a doctor. That kind of joke could cost you a lot of trouble. So long, Messalina. What a bitch ! 20... EV 06. Come on, hurry up ! Hell ! My client's escaping ! - Is that a time to get up ?! - Better late than never, Titin ! It's a shame, it's over 4 p.m. already ! And yet, that's not working who tires you out ! Come on Titin, don't talk about what you don't know ! You've got some nerve ! Anyway there's something I know: you owe me a fabulous bill ! So what about paying it ? - Thinking about it really kills me ! - Don't joke, I've been waiting for over a month ! So what ? Just wait ! And me, do I complain about waiting ? - And what are you waiting ? - A money order. Oh, just like the one from last time ! And where went this one ? - The casino. - Hey Titin, it's your turn ! I'm coming !... The casino... the roulette, huh ? Can't you play p?tanque like everybody does ? - Titin, do we have to wait until tomorrow ? - Titin, your friends are getting impatient. - Let them wait... I'm coming ! I give you one more week then I'll go to the police. - Yeah, that's the idea ! - Don't you make a fool out of me on top of that ! Gentlemen... - Do you have a smoke ? - Shut up ! - What can we do for you ? - I'm from the departmental insurance company. Yes ? One of our clients... He's an important political figure... You know what I mean... - Absolutely. - Someone hit his car while it was parked... - ...And forget to leave a visiting card. - Luckily a witness could wrote the registration number of that car. - And you would like us to check that number ? - Exactly. If it's possible for you. - What's the number of the car ? - 20 EV 06. - 06, it's a local registration. - You call the prefecture. - Yeah. - Thank you gentlemen. - You're welcome. - May I help you ? - Miss Lecain, please. - Do you have an appointment ? - Yeah, sure. Follow me. - What brings you here ? - A personal matter. - Isn't it for the job ? - What job ? The record shop, of course ! What are you looking at ? - It's a beautiful car. Who owns it ? - Miss H?l?ne, why ? - Just asking. - You're kinda inquisitive. Yeah... But it's my only fault. Wait for me here. - What's your name already ? - Just say it's a friend. Mademoiselle is waiting for you. Follow me. Straight ahead... Your cigarette. - Sorry... Thanks Marie. - Marie ? But my name's Am?lie. Miss... - Sir... - I'm sorry to disturb you... - Yes ? - Let me introduce myself first... Pierre Menda. - I'm listening. - It's about a rather sensitive matter... You own a car registered under number 20 EV 06, right ? Yes indeed, why ? Last night, I was knocked over by your Cadillac. - Last night, are you sure ? - Absolutely sure. You must be mistaken. My car didn't move from here since three days. The car parked in front of the main door ? - Yes. - So I'm not mistaken but don't worry: I wasn't hurt. I'm glad to hear that but once again, you're mistaken. Impossible. Let's suppose it... What can I do for you ? Absolutely nothing. I just wanted to find the driver of the car but I really don't think it's you. Sorry if I bothered you. Just a minute... I'd like to straighten this out. Sit down. I really don't understand. I first thought you made up everything. To get into your place and squeeze some money out of you, is that it ? Yes. But I don't think that anymore. I live alone here with my disabled sister. We have a maid and a gardener but none of them can drive and I never go out at night. Where do you keep your car key ? - On the dashboard, of course ! - Look no further. Someone is having rides... My sister. Hello. My name's Eva. How do you do ? - And you ? - Menda... Pierre Menda. - Menda ? But I know you ! - Come on, Eva ! Try to remember, H?l?ne. The TV show "Poets and men", it's you, right ? - That's me, all right. - Oh yes, indeed. That's why your face was looking familiar. - I love your show. Your voice is so captivating ! - Please... H?l?ne, isn't he has a voice... And his eyes... - Yes. He mostly reads poetry very well. - Please stop or I'm going to blush. - Why don't you sit down ? - Well, it's late, I don't want to... Oh no ! We're glad to have you here ! We keep you for dinner, isn't it H?l?ne ? I'd love to, honey, but Mr Menda has maybe other plans. No... But I don't want to impose myself. Please stay. Oh !... Want a candy ? No, thanks. - H?l?ne, bring us something to drink. - Right away, honey. Whiskey, Martini, Porto ? Whiskey. Sit down ! I'll have a Porto... It's very nice of you to stay. By the way, what's this car business about ? - Did you hear us ? - Yes, I was in the patio. Unbelievable, isn't it ? What do you think ? I don't understand but it's fascinating ! - You really think so ? - Yes, I love mysteries ! I could do without that kind of mysteries ! We'll have to do our own investigation. Till then, I drink to the luck that made us meet. - Then to luck. - You seem sceptical. - I don't believe much in luck. - H?l?ne, tell Am?lie we have a guest for dinner. Yes, I come back right away. What do you think about H?l?ne ? - She's beautiful. - Beautiful, indeed. And what do you think about me ? - You're lovely. - You know we don't have the same mother ? - I'd have never guess, you're so similar. - Yes... But we have totally different temperaments. - I figured out that already ! Yes, H?l?ne is always a bit sad. It's not funny to take care of a disabled person. - She never got married ? - She could to, and have children. But she chose to stay by my side to be my home nurse. But I annoy you with my stories ! - Tell me more about yourself. - I just stay on that damn wheelchair all day. Poliomyelitis. When I was 16. It came on my legs and I can't walk anymore. - No physiotherapy ? - No, it's hopeless. But it doesn't stop me from being very cheerful ! One should always look on the bright side, isn't it ? - Of course. The important thing is to find sources of entertainment. - Guess what I found ? - I don't know, you read, you embroider... You're watching TV... - That's for the daytime, but at night ? I guess you're sleeping like everybody does. I'm writing poetry. - Well ! - Are you surprised ? I do sleep too but when inspiration comes to me... You get up, go to your window and write in the moonlight. Exactly ! Except that I can't walk. That's true, I beg you pardon. -I wrote my poems in my bed. - Is it possible to read them ? I never show them to anybody but I'll make an exception for you. - It's a great honour ! - I've got a tape recorder and... - And you'd like me to record your poems ? - Yes. Would you do it ? If it can make you happy but... I'm a bit rusty, you know ? - Don't be too humble ! - You were here ? - Did you hear, H?l?ne ? How wonderful ! - What, honey ? Pierre agreed to record my poems. It's wonderful, indeed. Mr Menda, you just won over my sister ! To your victory ! "I drew my lips on a whirligig and then threw the whirligig to the clouds Beyond the great blue sky and the spreading out clouds And I stayed alone with the great blue sky And I cried a lot..." Eva, your poems are so beautiful. But so sad... - Did you like them ? Yes, you're very talented. I'd have loved to tell them in my show but... - But ? - My show get sacked and me along. - Why ? - It would be too long to explain. For sordid reasons who have nothing to do with poetry. - What a shame. - So what are you doing, now ? Not much. A bit of radio... A friend promises me a job at Radio Monte-Carlo. So that's why you came to the Riviera ? Yes, I had some money but I left it to the casino. The casino ! I would spend my days there ! Luckily I can't or I'd have pushed us to bankrupt already, isn't it, H?l?ne ? Yes... I had a lovely evening but I can't miss the last bus... Oh no ! You can't leave like this ! H?l?ne, bring the cards and let's have a poker ! We can never play only the two of us. - Me, I'm okay but... - I just don't want to walk my way back. Especially at late night, you could have some bad encounters. - I start to be used to it, you know. - H?l?ne can drive you back with the car. Honey, you know my eyes are bad and I don't like driving at night. - But you do it from time to time, no ? - Eva ! - Don't bother, I'll take the bus. - Please, stay ! We have a guest room ! - Don't insist, Eva ! Mr Menda wants to go. - No, he doesn't. He's just shy. - You really are shy, do you ? - Like a young girl ! Am?lie ! Am?lie, show Mr Pierre to the guest room. If you don't like it, I'll let you go. - Well, Mademoiselle. - She's terrible ! A real tyrant ! How could I resist her ? - You'll sleep very well here. - I hope so ! What do you think about him ? He's very nice. And you ? Me, I think he's... Well ? It's not what you think. I'm not a romantic like you. - Why do you say that ? - I know you well. I kept an eye on you during the dinner. You eyed him greedily. Can you speak about something else ? Up to you... You know what I'm thinking ? - No. - Why don't we ask him to manage the shop ? - You're not serious ? We hardly know him. - That's not a problem. Not everyone can manage a business like this. I trust Pierre. He's exactly the man we need. And I'm sure he would agree. I'd like to have a word of that with Mr Gibaud first. No. With Pierre first. - There's no rush, let's think about it. - Watch out, he's coming. The room is lovely, Am?lie won over me and anyway I missed the last bus. So what about this poker game ? I'm warning you that I'm tough ! - We know how to defend ourselves. - Well. H?l?ne, the cards ! - We were speaking about you, Mr Menda. - Can I know what you were saying ? Tomorrow, if you behave yourself. Bravo ! - Have you been here for long ? - No, I just get up. Please, don't stop because of me. - Sorry. It's over for today. Too bad. It was a lovely show. - Stop that ! Aren't you ashamed ? - Ashamed ? Why ? - Did you had a good night ? - Yes, I had a wonderful sleep. - I go change myself and I'll be all yours. - Why ? You're perfect like this. I don't want Eva to see me dressed liked this. Do you understand ? - I'm sorry. I didn't think about it. - That's why I do my workout so early. She'd be sad if she could see me. I understand. I bet it's not a fun situation to live. One gets used to any situation, you know ? - By the way, did Am?lie brought your breakfast ? - No but don't bother her. I'll ask her to serve it in the patio. I'll meet you there. Hello ! You're up already ? I was on my way to see you. You could say hello. - So, do you think she's attractive ? - Excuse-me ? - Do you think H?l?ne's attractive ? - What is it to you ? - Answer me. She's beautiful, isn't she ? - She's fine, indeed. - Is that all ? - Why all these questions ? For nothing. Take me to the patio. - At your orders, Mademoiselle ! Did Mademoiselle had her breakfast already ? - No. - I was watching you, before. - I noticed that. H?l?ne seemed to enjoy your compliments. You know it's bad to listen at the windows ? - Come on, don't give me a lecture ! - Are you getting jealous ? - Of you ? Don't make me laugh ! - I meant of your sister. Jealous of H?l?ne ! It's ridiculous ! I feel more sorry for her than envious. - Did I scare you ? - Don't ever do that ! You know I hate this kind of jokes ! - You're so nervous this morning ! - Because you frightened me to death ! Calm down, my sweet, I should not did it. I always forget how sensible she is. - What a wonderful weather, it's like heaven ! - Then come back to earth, I have to speak to you. - Hello, Am?lie. - Hello, Mesdemoiselles. - Leave it to me. - We have a job to offer you, isn't H?l?ne ? - Yes. - A job ? - Yes. I hire you. - As what ? Your gardener ? - Why not ? You can't afford to pick and choose ! Eva ! That's true but that's not a reason. - How much can we offer him per month ? - You better explain Mr Menda what is it about first. - Don't bother, H?l?ne. And you, listen to me carefully. Despite all your money, I'm too expensive for you. - Please, she didn't mean to offend you. - Forget it, H?l?ne. It's better that way. So long ! - Pierre ! Let him go if he doesn't understand ! Why did you speak to him like this ? He's not a servant ! He started the whole thing ! He got on his high horse ! Everyone is not always at your disposal, like I do ! - Yes, I know. You're a martyr ! - That's out of the point ! You're going too far ! I don't want to have an argument because of... - Because of him ! Say it ! It makes you sick that he's gone ! - Shut up ! You don't know what you're saying. Do you think I didn't see you this morning ? I can't walk but I'm not blind ! - What do you mean ? - Nothing ! I'm so unhappy... Come on, honey... I'm sorry. I shouldn't had speak to you like this. It's also my fault. Forgive me... We have to catch him back. Take the car and tell him I'm sorry. Take it easy, I'm going. - Bring him back ! - Yes ! Pierre... - Since she says she's sorry. - She's a ill-bred girl. She thinks she can get away with anything because... - Pierre. Yes, I know... But she should be taught a lesson ! - I agree. You'll do it when we'll be back. - Do you really think I'm coming back ? - I wish it. We need you. - As a nanny this time ? Don't be mean... The car's here. - The ghost car ! - Oh please, not again ! - What do you want from me ? - I'll explain you on the way. - Did you get the idea of offer me this job ? - No, Eva did. Why ? I would have maybe prefer if it was you. Come on, get in. Why are you looking at me like this ? For nothing. We of course will have plenty of advertisement posters. Pictures of all the greatest stars ! Now, pay attention ! Here, we'll have a desk fit out for the records. And here a small but great detail: "Now available" ! Over there, the listening machines and up there we'll have a stand to show all the label's catalogues, star pictures and so on... Over there, the cash box and in the windows we'll arrange records hanged by strings. The last hits ! They're not here yet but it won't be long. - You're used to arrange that kind of shop ! - That's what I do ! - It must be exciting. - Yes. When the business is working ! - I hope ours will be successful. - We do everything for that ! If I understand well, you only deal with the launching ? Yes. As soon as it's open, I go back to Paris to launch an other business ! - When can we open ? - I don't know. In about ten days if it works well. Excuse-me, I have to get back to work ! - What do you think ? - I must say it's interesting. - Do you accept ? - I'm thirsty. What about a drink ? Certainly. So, dear friends... But where are they ? Good bye ! Oh ! How cute he is ! What can I get you ? - A squeezed lemon, please. - For me, a pastis. With some olives. Right away, sir. So cute ! We have an august weather. That's true. You don't realised it if you stay here for long. - I'd like to have an old pad by the sea. - That's easy. My villa is at your disposal. - No, I said an old pad ! - Sorry, I've got nothing cheesier to offer you ! Is that mean if I accept, I'll have to go to leave in your place ? It would be the best solution. You wont need for anything and it would be convenient for our business matters. - Another idea of your sister ! - No, this time the idea is mine. - In that case... Is that a yes ? It's a yes. - Pick some better ones, Julien. - Yes, Mademoiselle. Am?lie will put them in Mr Pierre's bedroom. Quickly Julien, take me in ! - Right away, Mademoiselle. Just... - Leave it and take me in ! - Very well, Mademoiselle. - Where is she ? - She can't be far. I'm sure she saw us. So why pretending ? We can't say with her. She's acting as if she doesn't care but I'm sure she's glad. What a strange girl ! - Julien ? - Mademoiselle ? - Is my sister in ? - She's in her bedroom. Thank you... By the way, Julien. Don't forget to wash the car tonight. Very well, Mademoiselle. - I'll call Mr Gibaud, my lawyer. - I'm gonna pay a visit to our enfant terrible. Tell her the good news but don't be too harsh on her. - What is it ? - It's me. What do you want ? Look, Eva. What do you want, really ? You seem upset to have me back. - You know I'm not. - So what game are you playing ? I'm not playing... I'm in love with you. In love with me ? Since when ? You can't be serious ! - Are you mad at me ? - You mean this morning ? - Yes. You know it's forgotten already. Then, kiss me. - Not bad. - Are you angry ? Is that a problem that I love you ? - Don't mention that anymore. - Up to you... - Pierre ! Eva ! Lunch's ready ! I'm coming ! I'll wait for you downstairs. Wipe your lips ! Unless you want H?l?ne to be angry with me ! I could eat a horse. Aren't you ? "- I've got no regrets. - You know what you deserve ? I do. But you you wont do it. You don't have the guts. You asked for it." - That was soppy ! - That was incredible. - It has to have a bad ending. - She doesn't know how to dress but she's a fine actress. - Perverted women like this don't exist ! - I'm sure they do ! - Anyway, she kept her cards closed to her chest ! What would have you done if you were that man, Pierre ? - I don't know... - Do you think he was right to kill her ? - She made him do it for sure. - That's true. But she really was unhappy. - Yes. I feel sorry for this kind of women. - You're right, they are sick. Anyway it's only a play and I'm falling asleep. Why don't we go to bed ? Good idea, I take you to the lift. - Are you coming, H?l?ne ? - In a minute. What a lovely night. - Good night. Sweet dreams ! - I've no dreams anymore since ages. - You don't know what you miss ! - I've got other sources of happiness. - Like poetry ? - Exactly, like poetry. Bye bye, sleep well ! - How do you feel ? - Like I'm gonna have nightmares all night. - Because of the play ? - Yes. You're too sensible. That's true, anything can disturb me. - Good night, Pierre. - Go to see your sister ? I help her to go to bed every night. The morning it's Am?lie. - Don't forget our appointment at Mr Gibaud's office at 10. - Sure. Good evening. It's you, Pierre... You frightened me. I thought you never went out at night. What are you doing here ? And you ? I forgot my handbag in the car. Here it is ! - You're lying ! You take the car to go pick up some guy at the beach ! - Are you insane ? - I've got a good reason for that ! Especially when I realised that a woman like you is nothing else than a whore ! - Why did you insult me ? - Because... I think I better tell you everything. Let's have a seat. "Be quiet, sorrow of mine..." And that's why you came here. To find that girl. Yes. I wanted to know what she looks like. I thought she was some lunatic. What would have you done if it was me ? I don't know. H?l?ne... We have to go back inside. Eva's gonna wonder what I'm doing. H?l?ne... I'd like to tell you something. Yes ? I never was more happy than tonight. Good night. What are we going to do ? I don't know. Tomorrow, we'll try to explain her. - Explain her what ? That we're in love and there's nothing wrong about it. - You must speak to her now. - No, tomorrow. Tomorrow, it can be too late. You don't know her, she could do something stupid. I'm going. - No ! Let me do it. Thank you. Eva... Eva, it's not what you think. I love your sister. - It can't be ! - It's true. And I can't help it. - And you came to tell me that ? - Yes, I... I'd like you to understand. There's nothing to understand. It's all clear. Are you gonna get married ? I'll marry H?l?ne only when I'll have a position. You wont have to wait for long. Congratulation, it's a nice work ! Listen, I don't want to have an argument with you but if you want to be like this... No ! Please, stay... Listen, Eva... I feel for you... - A strong friendship ? - No ! Not only friendship ! Affection, tenderness... - Pity, just say the word... I swear it's not that. I don't want to separate you from H?l?ne. On the contrary... - You forgot what happened between us. - You know I've done nothing for it. - What if H?l?ne find out about it ? - Is that blackmailing ? You know what she would do ? - I guess so. - She'd kick you out ! If it's what you want... Your sedative, honey. - You're right in time, Eva wants to speak to you. - Yes ? Good night, I leave you two alone. You wanted to tell me something ? - Pierre explained me everything. - Ah ? - He also told me that... - Listen. It's late now.... Let's speak about it tomorrow. - So ? - She's in bed. - What did you give her ? A sleeping pill ? - No, just a sedative. I don't need one: I'm falling asleep. - How did she react ? - Not very well. Good night. Sleep well. Eva... Eva ! - H?l?ne ! - Mademoiselle just went out. Thank you. - Hurry up or we gonna be late. - Excuse-me. - Miss ? - Hello, Lucien. - Do I fill it up ? - Yes and please check the tank. - Are you sure there was 20 litres ? - Yes, I mean I think. By the way, H?l?ne... Does everything was tried for Eva ? Everything. She stayed three months in Garches hospital for no result. Why are you asking me that ? Just to be sure. - There's nothing wrong with the tank. - Then I must be mistaken. Put it on my count. Good bye, sir. Well, dear friend, since you agree on everything, I'll have the contracts done and I'll bring them myself tomorrow morning at the shop. You'll just have to sign. A cigar ? - No, thanks. I'm coming along... Mathilde ! If someone asks me, I'll be at the shop. - I leave you two alone. - Don't you come with us ? No, I've some shopping to do. You're big boys, anyway ! - Do you need a lift ? - No. Don't bother for me. Good bye, sir. - Where do we meet ? - Don't wait for me. I'll walk back. - Hello. - Hello H?l?ne, how is the shop going ? - Well. I'm gonna steal your clients. - When do you open ? - In about 10 days. - Did you find a manager ? A very fine guy, yes. - You should pay us a visit. Eva would be glad. - How is she ? Always the same. Say, did you get some new hits ? - Wait... Yes ! A great record ! "Night embrace". Listen this. Don't you think it's great ? - It's funny, I feel like I heard it before. - I don't think so. It was just put on sale. Or maybe on radio. - Beautiful, isn't it ? - Yes, who is it ? - H?l?ne is not with you ? - She's doing some shopping. Are you doing a patience ? - Yes. Do you know this one ? - You have to do a... - Missed ! Does everything was fine with Mr Gibaud ? He's very nice, isn't it ? Very. I don't know what's wrong with me today, I'm totally dazed. Probably because of the sedative H?l?ne gave me yesterday. She's been a bit heavy-handed. My mind's foggy. - I've got a small present for you. - A present ? Here. - That's my ribbon. Where did you find it ? - In the garage this morning. I looked for it everywhere. Probably H?l?ne, she's always borrowing my stuff. Is it ? I wanted to ask you something, Eva. Did you try to walk since your illness ? - Why this question ? - I'd like us to try together. - Together ? - Yes. I'll help you stand and you'll try to move your legs. - Does it bother you ? - If it can make you happy. But we wont make it. That's not the first time, you know ? Let's have a try. Ready ? Put your arms around my neck. - Can you feel the floor ? - I can't feel anything. Take off your arms. Make a step. - No, I can't ! - Just try ! - I tell you I can't feel a thing ! - Try harder for Christ's sake ! I can't ! My God ! What are you doing ? - Here, sit down. - Come on, Pierre ! What did I tell you ? Eva, where are you going ? Eva ! Leave her alone. She's gonna simmer down by herself. But what's the matter with you ? - A stupid idea I've got. I get it into my head that she could walk. - But you know it's impossible. - I know. But there's something I can't explain to myself. - What ? This morning, I went to Eva's room. She was asleep... Don't you think it's weird ? For the car, Julien maybe forgot to wash it. And for the ribbon... - I gave it to you yesterday night. - And I put it on her bedside table. The wind could has taken it away. Eva's always sleeping with the window open. The wind ! You mean a cyclone ! And that doesn't explain the sand ! I don't know. Eva's spending a lot of time in the garden and there's plenty of sand in the alleys. - But she's seating on her wheelchair and her feet don't touch the ground ! I don't understand... Unless... - Unless she can walk, that's all. - That's not what a meant. - If Mademoiselle wants to have her lunch. It's past 1 p.m. already. - Right away, Am?lie. I go get Eva. - Mademoiselle, can I have a drop of rum, it's for the baba. - Yes. The bottle's here. - Thank you. - Say, Am?lie, did you see Julien ? - Maybe in the garden. - Are you really sure it's for the baba ? - Who do you think I am, Mr Pierre ? The baba ! - Hello, Julien. - Mr Pierre, I brought your suitcases upstairs. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Say, Julien... Did you cleaned the car yesterday ? - Of course, I did. I double cleaned it ! I even changed the front wheel who had a puncture. Why ? Something's wrong ? No, it's perfectly all right... Did you picked the roses in my room ? - Yes. Beautiful, aren't they ? Yes, beautiful. Was the idea yours ? - No ! I wouldn't dare to damage the rosebush like this ! Mademoiselle Eva asked me to picked them. - Thank you. Don't you go have lunch ? - Sure, I just finish watering first. - There's some baba. - I better like plain rum ! H?l?ne... What's wrong ? - Eva... - Is she sick ? - She vanished ! - Vanished ! Are you kidding me ? No. She's neither in the house nor in her room. It's incredible. How could she ? I don't understand. I woke up and I wanted to check if Eva was fine... She wasn't in her bed... The room was empty. I wasn't wrong: she can walk ! - But it's impossible ! - Just be logical. It's not a kidnapping for sure ! - She can't even stand up ! - She can be just simulating ! - It's ridiculous ! Why would she be pretending ? - I don't know. She maybe has her reason. - What reason ? - I don't know. - No... Pierre, we must find her: I'm afraid... Come. Have a look over there. Eva... No, nothing... Eva... That's enough ! Don't pretend to sleep ! I know everything ! - What's wrong ? - Are you awake ? Oh, it's you, Pierre ? I was dreaming I was taken out to the countryside... You really think I'm an idiot ! - What ? - I went in your room with H?l?ne a moment ago. You weren't there ! - What are you saying ? You're no more disabled than I am ! Did you had a nice ride ? Liar ! Bloody liar ! I get the picture now ! You want to get rid of me to stay alone with H?l?ne ! - H?l?ne told me you weren't in your room. I was sleeping. H?l?ne ? That's not true ! I swear it. - Pierre ! - What again ? Then it's her ! She's trying to make me look like a lunatic ! She must had drug me. You saw I couldn't woke up. And she dragged me outside ! I felt like I was dragged in my sleep... Stop making up things ! How H?l?ne could have the strength ? I know what I'm saying. She must has used the lift. How dare you accused H?l?ne of something like this ? You're vile ! Look, I know you can walk. I also know you're the worst slut I ever met ! Eva... Eva, if I'm wrong I would never forgive myself. Come in. So what do you think ? I've been living for years with Eva. And I realised today that she hates me. - H?l?ne... - No. Forget it, Pierre. She made up that story to get away with it. She'll never forgive me for what happened between the two of us. You see I was right: she can walk. But since when ? Why didn't she ever tell me ? No. We must be missing something. - I'd like to know what. - She maybe can't help it. - I doubt that. We should ask to our doctor and explain him the whole story. You're right. I'll go to see him tomorrow. H?l?ne... Eva spoke about some drug... Did you gave her something yesterday ? - You mean her sedative ? - Yes... No, I didn't give her anything. She lied. Considering the kind of illness she got and how bad it is, it's very unlikely that she can walk. Her treatment in Garches has been a failure. However, the facts are here, doctor: she can walk. - We're maybe dealing with an isolate case. - A case ? You know polio - if it's really polio - is a very little known illness. She could has felt an improvement. Or did some re-education without telling to anyone. - Without telling anyone ? If polio is an unknown illness, the human mind is even more difficult to understand. Especially the mind of a young girl raised on a wheelchair. - I'd like you to examine her anyway. - Just tell me when ! - As soon as possible. - If you want, I'll come this afternoon. Perfect. If I'm not there when you come, I'll call you later. - Come on, don't worry too much. - Thank you, doctor. - Well, doctor ? - Alas... Nothing new my child... Maybe a slight improvement of the general condition. Do you feel better ? - Yes, lots better. - Well. You take your sedative regularly ? - Yes. H?l?ne give it to me every night. - Then, it's perfect. See you soon, my child. - Want a cup of tea, doctor ? No, thanks. It's nice of you but I'm late already and I've got plenty of clients to see. I show you out. - Good bye, Eva. - Good bye, doctor. Thank you. - Well, doctor ? - I don't think she can walk. Yet... - Yet ? For legs paralysed for already three years, they kept quite strong calf. That's rarely seen in a poliomyelitis case. - What did I tell you ? - Yes, but it doesn't prove a thing. I'd like a specialist from Paris to see her. Do you agree, H?l?ne ? - Of course. - I'll write to professor Farnoux. He's a great guy. - Thank you. Yes, but don't delude yourselves. I think you're mistaking. - It's impossible, doctor. - Did you see her walk ? But, listen... No. - So ? Don't bother. Pierre... I swear it's not my fault. Of course. - Is it all right at the shop ? - Fine. - Am?lie. - Mademoiselle ? - Bring us some tea in the patio. - With some cookies ? - Yes. - And some cake. - And some cake. - Very well, Mademoiselle. Well, sit down. Don't be afraid... Are you reassured now that you've seen the doctor ? - Eva... - Yes ? Nothing... You're right, Pierre. There's nothing to say. - Pardon me about last night. - I'm not dead, am I ? You know what I thought about ? You maybe have sleepwalking crisis during which you're able to walk. That's possible. - Sleepwalker, me ? That's the hell of a news ! H?l?ne told you that, right ? - Not at all. - No, it's me. Even if it was true, it wouldn't explain that deep sleep you couldn't drag me out. How do you know I couldn't woke you up if you were really sleeping ? - Well, I... - Oh please, let's stop with all that. We better forget about all this. I just hope you remember you made your sister very sad. Yes... H?l?ne... I didn't mean what I said. I know, honey. It doesn't matter. Oh H?l?ne... I beg you pardon. Come on. Calm down. - What's wrong again ? - Nothing. It was bound to happen. I always knew it would end in tears ! - Say... Who bought that record ? - It's me. - Yes, but for me. - How many sugars ? - Some cake ? - Want some milk ? - That's were I was born. - In that house ? Yes. It's pretty... Here's my father with H?l?ne's mother. And here ? Me at 8. I remember it was during the summer holidays. You were a lovely little girl. And you still are. Yes, up to there. You see that woman ? - Yes. Who is she ? - My mother. She was beautiful, isn't she ? - Very beautiful. - Here honey, your sedative... Give it to me. - No ! Leave it ! - Don't you want me to put it away ? - No, I want to watch it a bit more. - Well, good night. Are you coming, Pierre ? - Are you sure you want me to lock you up ? - I'll feel better that way. - Don't you prefer me to sleep in your room ? - No, it's perfectly safe like this. - I'll keep the key and open you up tomorrow. Good night. - Behave yourselves ! - Eva. - Yes ? - That's it, you're locked up from this side. - Thank you ! - I'll go close the other door. - All this is a bit ridiculous. Good night, Eva... It's done, you can rest easy. See you tomorrow. - What a story ! - I don't think it's funny ! If it can make her happy. - Thank you, Pierre. - For what ? - For everything you're doing. - You maybe wouldn't have those problems if I wasn't here. - Why are you saying that ? My life's so different since you're here. I wish I could be happy at last. - I'll do everything I can for that. Don't go... I'm afraid... - What's wrong, now ? - Hold me tight... Protect me... What are you doing here ? I heard some noise in Eva's room. I called her but she didn't answered... I was afraid something might had happened. As her door was closed I used the lift. - Why didn't you wake me up ? - I didn't want to bother you. I thought it maybe wasn't serious. - Everything looks fine to me. - Don't wake her up. What's this ? See Pierre ? I wasn't mistaking. Eva was about to go out. Don't you believe me ? I wish I could, H?l?ne. But all this sounds fishy. Listen, Pierre... From tomorrow, Eva's gonna sleep in my room. Like this... - Like this no misunderstanding will occur, right ? Good night. Nothing has happened in ten days. - Since I have my bed in H?l?ne's room. - If I knew, we'd have done it before. See ? H?l?ne's bringing you luck. - It's true. The Devil himself would have no hold on her. - You're joking... No. Only you could have sacrifice your life like you did. Please, Eva, don't mention it. It's perfectly normal. What about a word of this afternoon's schedule ? - I'm so glad to go with you ! - We mustn't be late ! We'll drink Champagne and eat loads of cake ! Let's have a toast ! Sure ! - To our success ! - To our success ! I'm sorry, Eva. I should have understand earlier. I drive you home. - One card. - Three cards. - Check. - Fold. - That's a pot. - Open to aces. - What a day ! I'm dead. - Was everything all right ? Absolutely. By the way, I had you an appointment with Andr? and Gibaud tomorrow morning. - Okay. - They'll give you the keys of the shop. - I open with 500. Meet. Hello ? Yes, it's me. Oh, doctor ! How are you since this afternoon ? Really ? It's wonderful. The day after tomorrow ? Thanks. Of course, you'll come with him. Perfect... Good bye and thanks again. Honey, I've got good news for you. - Good news ? - Farnoux, the specialist from Paris... - Is he coming ? - On the day after tomorrow, he's caring about your case. - You could have told me about it ! We wanted to surprised you, isn't it, Pierre ? - You don't seem pleased. - Sure I am but... It's normal if you're nervous, honey. Mademoiselle, it's for you... Come on, kids. - How beautiful ! - Who send them ? It's from Mr Pierre Menda ! Pierre... - She vanished again. - How could she since she's sleeping in your room ? I was sleeping... I can't stay awake all night long... - Sure... And ? - A bad feeling woke me up. I turned on the light. Her bed was empty. - Did you looked for her ? - Not yet. I just noticed it. - Her clothes ? - Also vanished. Let's have a look. Are you worried ? - I've got reason to be, isn't it ? I'm afraid too... I feel like... You're feeling like what ? - Didn't you locked the door ? - No, my bed is between hers and the door. Of course... How come you didn't hear her get dressed ? I bet she dressed in the bathroom. - Is that her sedative ? - I don't know. How's that you don't know !? The glass isn't empty so you gave her some, right ? Not at all. I didn't give her anything tonight. Where's the flask ? In the medicine cabinet, I bet. I don't see it, where is it ? I don't know. H?l?ne, you're hiding something from me. - Pierre ! - Where's the flask ? - But I tell you... - Listen to me ! If Eva has drunk the sedative, she'd be incapable to get down the stairs. - What do yo mean ? - This... Two weeks ago, when I came in Eva's room, you were dressing her up. - You're out of your mind ! - I get the picture, now... The ribbon, the record, the sand in the shoes... - What are you saying ? Please, Pierre... - Let me see your slippers ! - Why ? - Just do as I say ! What's this if you weren't outside tonight ? I don't understand... I can't stand it anymore. You really hate your sister, aren't you ? You've been a prisoner of that damn wheelchair for years ! Let me tell you: you're the one who's disabled ! - You're wrong, Pierre. You try to make her believe she's insane and go out at night when it's actually you ! - Why would I do something like that ? - Because you're the one I met the first night and not Eva ! - You don't know what you're saying anymore ! - What a fool I was... - Pierre, I swear it's not me. I love you. I've nothing to do with all that ! - Where is she ? Where did you hide her this time ? - But I tell you I don't know ! - Very well. Let's look for her together. - No, go on your own, I can't take it no more... - I can take it for two, come on ! - No, leave me alone ! - You make me sick ! Where am I ? In your room. I'll be back in a minute. Pierre... You're gonna feel better. - I did something wrong again ? - No. That's not your fault. - Where's H?l?ne ? Is she okay ? - I'll explain you later. Just stay calm. I'll get you some coffee. - Please come back quickly. I'm afraid to stay alone. - I'll be right back. H?l?ne, where were you ? Where were you, H?l?ne ? What's wrong with you ? Why are you looking at me like this ? You're insane ! Pierre ! I lost everything because of you ! But don't delude yourself, he's not gonna stay with you. - I don't understand. Where are you going ? Why the suitcase ? It's all right. It's terrible ! Where did she go ? You had an argument ? Because of me ? You must sleep now, it's late. Poor H?l?ne... What's gonna happen to her ? Don't worry... She'll be just fine. Better than me, anyway... Why ? What are you going to do ? You're not going to leave me, aren't you ? I have to go. It's not possible. Please don't leave me alone. What am I going to do without you ? You've got Am?lie... Am?lie... What about the shop ? That's true, I forgot about it... Well, I'll be your employee but I'll live at the hotel. No way ! You'll stay here. - I need you so badly... - Please calm down, I'll do what you want. Thank you, Pierre. Try to rest, now. - Pierre... - Yes ? - It's my birthday. - No ? - Yes. I'm 20. - It's wonderful ! - Yes. - We'll celebrate tonight. Oh yes ! - I count on you. - Don't worry. The dress will be delivered in an hour. Okay. - Mr Pierre ! - Hello. Anything new since this morning ? No, it's okay. Just a phone call from Mr Gibaud. - Marcel, come for a minute. - Do you need me, Mr Pierre ? - What did he want ? - He asked me to buy candies. - Candies, why ? - For Mademoiselle H?l?ne ! Of course ! I forgot ! What a lucky dog ! - Where are you going ? - To the tobacconist's. - And Am?lie ? - Mademoiselle Eva sent her for shopping. - Why ? Do you need a hand ? - No, it's fine, thanks. - Is Mademoiselle Eva in her room ? - Yes, Mr Pierre. It's wonderful, isn't it ? Pierre... I have to explain you. It's... I was so happy and the dress's so beautiful that... I wanted to see me in the mirror... I felt like a shock and... My legs just carried me ! Don't you believe me ? I can't anymore... I feel like I'm gonna fall down. Pierre, if I could do it once then I'll do it again... Step by step, with your help, I'll learn how to walk ! - Now, tell me the truth ! - The truth ? The first night in the car... It was you... - But Pierre ! - Answer me ! It really was you, isn't it ? If it was me... Would you be mad ? Eva... Since when are you playing this game ? Since when ? I've been very ill when I was 17... The doctor told my father he was afraid it could be polio. He found symptoms... - I heard everything... - You were fine and you just simulate ! Yes ! - How could you !? - It asked me courage. A lot of courage ! But if you could know how well I feel on that wheelchair ! Of course... Life doesn't come to me, but I can control it ! I wheel on it just like I wheel on that carpet ! Why ? Because of my father. He liked better H?l?ne. He never forgive my mother to leave him. H?l?ne... H?l?ne always was more beautiful, sweeter, brighter ! I had enough of it. I wanted to be cared too. And I succeeded perfectly ! H?l?ne was supposed to get married. I stopped that wedding. Before he died, daddy had her swear she'll stay by my side to take care of me. She stayed... I had her life wasted ! Yes, Pierre ! That woman in the car, that was me ! I was so afraid you recognised me the first time you came. When you told me you were in love with H?l?ne, it almost drove me crazy ! I did everything I could to part the two of you ! H?l?ne's gone. She won't be back ! We'll stay the two of us ! I'll never let you go ! I love you ! You hear me ? I love you ! You can't leave me alone ! No, you can't ! Oh, Pierre ! I've only got two things left in my life. And I want to keep them. My childhood memories, here with my poems... And you ! Oh, Pierre ! Pierre, I love you ! Don't leave me alone, I beg of you ! Pierre ! Pierre, I can't get up ! I can't get up ! Pierre ! My legs ! My legs ! Pierre, I can't get up ! My legs ! My legs ! Translation and timing: Aquasantajoe For Cinemageddon, October 2009
