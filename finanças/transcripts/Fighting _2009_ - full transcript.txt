What happened to the whole, l don't know, "be ready for business, business ready" thing, huh? When l'm not being chased out of the damn Bronx trying to hustle up you some money, l'll be a little more alert. That ain't my fault. ln fact, they actually want you for another fight this Friday. Are you up for that? Yeah. How'd you do that? Well, l told you, l got my connections, you know. lt wasn't easy either. How much this time? Well, that's what l want to talk to you about, but give me a second, l need to put my clothes on. (CHUCKLES) lt's about this guy you're about to go up against. You know, l know you're a tough guy and everything, Shawn, but you're not going to beat him. But he's gonna. . . Come on, l can handle myself. l know you can, that's why, when he puts you in the choke move, you're gonna go to sleep, it's that easy. What are you saying? l think you know what l'm saying. No, l don't know what you're saying. Sounds like you're saying you want me to throw it. Well, whatever you want to call it, you know? We're gonna make some money, not like up in the Bronx. You're complaining about that whole thing, right? No, l'm not losing. l know you're not gonna lose, you're gonna do what l'm telling you to do. l appreciate everything you did for me. But, you know, the only way l'm going to lose is if somebody beats me. Okay, then, whatever, let him beat you. l'm serious. Martinez came up to me, he said, "You know, hey, if you go around with me, that's fine, man." l don't know. What? You and Martinez what? What do you mean, "what"? l want to hear why, you know, you said, "Martinez. . ." l didn't say l was gonna do anything.

You saw that picture l showed you of Martinez and Jack and me? l didn't say l was gonna go with him. l had a whole lot then, Shawn. He broke my leg for $1 00. That's crazy, right? $1 00. All l was saying is, l wanted to win. That's it, that's all l wanted. lt's funny, you lose one step in this game and everybody leaves you. At one point, there was a whole lot of people that would put a whole lot of money on me. You really think you can beat this kid, huh? l hear he's fierce, you know? 'Cause if you lose, you get nothing. You win, you get. . . You get $30,000. Hmm. Okay. Okay, we'll do it. (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) (CLEARS THROAT) Hi. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi. How are you?
