I was small-small when misi Rachael asked me for job. Juice for Spanish buck. I make lots of juice because buck is thirsty. But there is no buck. Only masra overseer with gunpowder... and Dikzak who always nibbled at the sugar. No buck. No. Only the sound of a buck. A buck being slaughtered. Thank you, misi. Say: "Thank you, misi." Thank you, misi. THE PRICE OF SUGAR My story begins on the plantation. It's called Berseba. It's a sugar plantation. Sugar is delicious. But also difficult. Sugar is tough-tough. My mother was a field slave. My story begins with my mother. She is 14 when my story begins. Her name is Kwasiba. Very good. See? He's listening. Rein in tight and he listens. Sit up straight. Get off the horse. You're big enough to try it too. Come on. You want to learn, eh? It doesn't hurt. She's sweet. We haven't finished yet. Go back inside. Go inside. I don't know which became my father. But he was white. That I became is important. And I became half black blood and half white blood. Daughter of Kwasiba. Kwasiba. Kwasiba. Where is Kwasiba? You have no ears? Sari needs suckling. Always stay close by, you hear? - Yes, misi. Otherwise you get Spanish buck. I don't want her to cry, ever. I thought about it, Kwasiba. I'll call your baby Mini-Mini. You hear me, Kwasiba? Yes, misi. Mini-Mini. I became Mini-Mini. Half-sister or half-niece of misi Sarith. She came at the same time as me. When I was six, my father died. But I don't know if he was my father. Within three days, my other father died. I don't know if he was my father either. With no husband or father, misi Rachael and misi Sarith moved... with all us house slaves to a new sugar plantation. Masra Levi Fernandez lived there with his daughter misi Elza... without wife, without mother. That's how we all became a new family. Misi Sarith and misi Elsa became sisters. And I became the personal slave of misi Sarith. Misi Sarith who was to be the prettiest misi in Suriname. My misi Sarith. Misi Sarith, wake up. Today's a lovely day. My misi can dance. Don't shout! I didn't sleep a wink. You dreamt about Nathan? - I listened to you snoring, Elza Shall I tickle you awake? - No. Misi Elza. Be careful with your blouse. And that one big masra was there too. - Masra Governor? And as Amimba came in, the governor dropped his pants. Wait, there's more... Amimba said: "The higher the hat, the smaller the pipi." I'll dry you off. Am I beautiful? Misi is gorgeous. Absolutely. Isn't this lovely? No. I want my pink dress. The pink one hasn't been washed, misi. I thought you wanted the yellow one today. You didn't? - And now what? I have to be most beautiful today. You don't want me beautiful? Are you so dumb? I'm really sorry, misi. I'll wash misi's prettiest dress now. My wife is at the club with some ladies. You'll meet her this evening. Zeeland pedigree, I always say. Don't get led astray by Paramaribo. It doesn't represent the wealth of the colony. The money gets spent here but it has to be earned on the plantations. And the yield is dropping. Coffee and sugar prices keep dropping. A couple more years and I'll be happy to rest on my laurels. And? What do you think, Mr Le Chasseur? Lovely. But just call me Rutger. Rutger. How much do I have to give him? What? - Tip. Don't be silly. "How much to tip him?" He's yours. Be my guest. He's all yours. Alex has been a fixture at the Loan Bank all his life. "How much to tip him?" It isn't Holland here. No, masra. I should take off your shoes. Shoes... But these are my good shoes. I have other ones... I'm not sure if we have the same size, but you can have these. No, no, masra. You don't understand, do you? Slaves don't wear shoes. O, Maisa... How could I be so stupid? - Listen, I'll help you. What's the difference between the two dresses. Sarith? Really. They're both beautiful. - That says more about you. No. More about you. You could look beautiful in a sack. Shall I wear that to the party? You have a sack for me? Grandma isn't interested in our clothes. - I'm not dressing up for her. For Nathan? How many good marriage partners do you know? Handsome and rich? Well? We live in a jungle. I don't want to be an old spinster... or to marry a fool! Why are you laughing, dear? Why -are -you -laughing? Moliere, nice. Lovely to see you again. Please, Rachael. We aren't in the jungle. Cover your slave. Are the others here yet? No, not everyone. Rachael. I'm not going to the synagogue. I look terrible. Is there any more beautiful spot? The frozen canals of Holland in the winter? I don't know them. I understand I can welcome you to my plantation soon... for an inspection? I am Julius Robles Medina. - I'm Rutger le Chasseur. I think Mr Van Omhoog mentioned you... Little Paradise? - Yes, that's it. Or it was. Are you married? No. Then I should introduce you to Mrs Fernandez' granddaughter. Your age. Intelligent... and a pearl... so incredibly beautiful. That girl... Eh, "misi". Misi who? Misi Elza. - Elza. Fernandez? "Umagranpikin." - What? Granddaughter in Dutch... "Umagranpikin." - You speak Dutch? You speak Dutch! Only -if -necessary. Is that the girl they're talking about? Shouldn't you go to the synagogue, Miss... Fernandez... Elza Fernandez. No. My father is Jewish, but not my mother. She's Lutheran. That means I'm not a Jewess. Nor are you? You're quite right, I'm not a Jewess. Mini-Mini, is it you? You have grown. - Hendrik. Put me down. Put me down. - Careful, or you'll fall. I'm ironing misi's dress. Let me. How you have grown. Don't call me Hendrik anymore. Now my name is Caesar. Masra Omhoog bought me. Maisa, How are you doing? May I ask you... why did they ever think of calling you Caesar? Don't laugh at me. Caesar was a great general, one of the best... Water. - Did you burn your hand? Put your hand in the water. -It's okay. Mini... the dress... Oh my god, no! No. - Yes? Just in time, I see? - No! Mini-mini. I'm not dressed. - That suits me. I'll only look at your eyes. Look. Fresh from the Old World. No. Come back when I'm decent. Decent? Even more decent? Should I open it? Or together? The latest fashion from Paris. And yes: there are wedding dresses. Does that mean your parents...? - Yes. You don't think I could marry that infant Leah Nassy? She's just 15. Look how very elegant. If she was the last woman in Suriname... then maybe. Look. You're beautiful. I love you and I'll marry you and no one else. I just have to play it right. I don't want to hurt my family so you have to live in a hut later. I want this for the betrothal. The only thing is... Fine. I'm working on getting a diplomatic post in Europe... Italy... So... after our wedding we may have to move to Rome. No. Yes. - What? No. - Yes. Sarith... something terrible happened... Mini-mini? Sorry, misi. I destroyed your beautiful dress. Burnt it. Look. What is there to laugh about? Why should you cry? It's my most beautiful dress! - We'll buy a new one in Rome... Or in Florence... - Or in Florence. Milan? - Yes? The Fernandez sisters. I haven't seen you for such a long time. Oh sorry, mother is calling us. With Nathan just now I had a very good idea. What if you and I married on the same day? We'd give the very biggest wedding reception ever seen in Suriname? Yes -and who would I marry? The boy you've been talking to all clay. Kiss him, Elza. Then he can't back out. Why do I have to marry? - Elza. We're 18, right? You don't want to be a spinster? I promised to introduce you to Miss Fernandez. I've been talking to her all afternoon. No, that's Miss Elza, her stepsister. No, I wanted to introduce you to... Miss Sarith, may I introduce you to the new assistant in Van Omhoog's office? Rutger Chasseur. - Le Chasseur. I'm sorry. Rutger le Chasseur. Pleased to meet you. Lovely party- I'm Sarith Fernandez. Not long ago Mr Le Chasseur was freezing in Holland. Yes, snow. There was lots of snow. What a lovely dress. - You think so? I expect to cross the ocean in a few months. Maybe for good. - Miss Sarith, you're leaving us? For a man? - You're going to Holland? Across the ocean isn't just Holland. If you will excuse me. Well? Did I say too much? The contra dance is about to start. Do come. Why are you watching this? Come. I have something to show you. I made this for you. You made it? May I look? - You may. D'you like it? -It's lovely. You see this chair? I made one just like it for the governor. My masra sells them and gives me money. - Much? Well, he saves it for me. The governor's big ass is on my chair. And what's this? Look, it's a watch. Then you can look to see when we meet each other. I know you have lots of other girls. That's what you think? - Am I lying? Listen... - Watch out, you'll fall. If I work five more years I'll have enough money. Then I won't be a slave. You know what I'll do? I'll make beautiful chairs... and all bakras will buy them. And you know what I'll do with the money? I'll come back... and I'll buy my beautiful girl's freedom. You know who? Who? - You. I love you. Look, masra! Misi's dress has arrived. Put it on the table by the musicians. Are the pancakes ready? Patience. Come on, Maisa. And don't forget to squeeze oranges. Oh, my god... Lovely, really. MY jewels. When you see them, all cheer. Music. Kiss! But when I live in Paramaribo, will you come and stay very often? Of course, more than you'd like. Do you like him? - Yes. Yes, he is the best one for you. But if you go to Europe, to Italy, then what? Then you demand that Rutger comes to Italy as well. In a row boat if he can't afford the voyage. You'll be really happy. Really. I think so too. You're mixing things up, Rutger. The Bible states clearly that God cursed Cham and his line and enslaved them. A slave can understand Dutch. That is... enough. - Yes. Hear but not speak. - There you are. May I have your attention? Just briefly. We have drunk a toast to the beautiful bridal couple... Elza and Rutger many times. But we can add another one. Because I see many empty glasses and many full carafes. Elza and Rutger, because a good example should be followed... I want to raise my glass to the next young couple getting married. We have fixed a date and on 12 March... my dear daughter Leah... will merry Nathan Diego Pos... Marie? Marry. - Aha: get wed! So, to Nathan and Leah... and of course Rutger and Elza. Cheers. My father is in debt. He might lose the plantation. I'm the first of three. Leah is an only child and her father has the biggest plantation. So it's only the money. I love you. Really. But I want to be an honest man and an honourable man. If you are an honourable man, what am I? You are... my most beautiful memory. You are my... My proof that heavenly love exists. And always shall. So my heavenly love is honourless, and your hellish treason is honourable? You know you can't always marry the one you love. There are other ways out. More delicate. - Sure. What we have is so precious. What if I'm pregnant? I have to tell everyone what's going on. Who the father is. Who else knows you're pregnant? Who else knows... - Don't touch me, you coward. Is this what you feel for me? I can't tell anyone about us? They'd think bad things about you. - Oh. About me? Not about you, about me. You can do anything and I can't? But I'm not your slave. I'd deny everything. I know you bedded that captain last year... - That bastard abused me. Your name is doing the rounds. Your name is doing the rounds. You're the only man for me. Please. You're the only one for me, the only one. Let's start scattering coins. What's the matter, misi? Everyone's getting married... and I'm being left all alone. Misi. Why doesn't she go and stay with Elza? Paramaribo has parties and young people. To sit sadly with the couple and see how happy they are? There are no suitable candidates hanging on banana trees. You don't need to tell me that. And no, she's not looking for a banana. She can have any man she wants. - Yes, except... Do shut up, you. Are you talking Sranang to me? Are you talking Sranang to me? How long are we going, misi? - A long time. To stay with misi Elza? - Why are you so happy? I'm happy for you, misi. - Are you in love? What? Who with? Is it masra Rutger's slave? What's his name? Alex? No misi, not him. As long as you know I always come first. I didn't hear you? - Yes, misi. Where is my bag? Sit down. This is the best scent in the world. Sniff. OK, so... If you go to him... Put a little bit on your wrist. Not too much. Dab it. And a little bit in your neck. And it drips down to your cleavage. You can keep the bottle. Thank you, misi. Paramaribo! Mini-mini, come on. Come and sit here. Look where's I'm sitting! Sarith! Oh Sarith, I missed you so. Me too. The plantation is so boring. Nothing happens. You can stay as long as you like. I'm so happy. Where's your husband? - Having a siesta. Van Omhoog asked if he'll take over his place in the Civil Court. Great news. Having a siesta when I arrive? Wake up! Fire! Fire! Wake up! Elza. Where's the fire? - Hi. Your sister-in-law came to stay. No fire? - No. What are you doing here? - Nice shirt. Where is my room? But you punish a child who's naughty? Slaves aren't children? - They are if they break the rules. But who makes the rules? - We do. But why should we? - We're the boss. Yes, but what gives us that right? Tighter, Alex. It's not a right, it's a duty. A solemn duty. That's enough Alex. Go and get masra Rutger for me. Yes, misi. Hey, there you are. Anything wrong? Have a look. I think there's a splinter in my foot. If I press here, it hurts. Yes. I won't be a moment. Maybe by daylight tomorrow. Elza is much better at it. Sleep tight. Blow out the candle. Hendrik. What fashion style is this? What's up with him? His masra... Masra Omhoog has sold him. Who to? - To the government. They're forming a black army to fight the maroons. The Black Hunter Corps... White officers and black soldiers going after Boni. We have to find and fight maroons. - You get weapons. Surely Masra Omhoog can't sell you. - The price was right. We don't all have a misi like yours. But when you come back, you'll be a free man, won't you? When I come back... if I ever come back. - Of course you will. You're strong, Hendrik. Anything's better than looting, plundering maroons. They only attack plantations that treat their slaves badly. They're the only ones attacked. - That's not true. Oh no? Who do you listen to? Your masra? Who do you listen to? When will I see you again? You stink of your misi. Hendrik! When? In a blink Hendrik, who was called Caesar, disappeared from my life. Caesar who wanted to be a carpenter and free negro. Come on, men. Keep going. Caesar who was going to buy my freedom. We'd live in a house in Paramaribo and have many-many of children. Caesar who turned up in my dreams every day... and who said every day in my dreams we'd soon meet again. It's not too deep. It's okay. - Come on, men! Follow me. Caesar who didn't want to be a soldier and didn't like the jungle. Keep your gunpowder dry! Come on, men! That Caesar disappeared. Far away into the jungle that Caesar didn't like. Caesar the carpenter who could turn wood into anything found new friends. Drop the guns. Tell the governor we'll never give up. Don't make us shoot you. Withdraw. - And leave your guns. Withdraw! Get out of here. We really fooled them. Running from wooden rifles. Throw them in the fire. We have real ones now. Caesar, you're a real carpenter. My turn. Okay. Don't touch that, that is hot. One hand. Don't blow. Suck. You blew. - At first, but not... To start it. But most important in that field was... Charles de Montesquieu Rutger... I'm going to sleep. Fine. Sleep tight. I have to work and tell Sarith about French ideas on justice and retribution. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. - Sleep tight. Where is it? Should I fetch masra for you? No. No, Maisa. It's alright. You have any food for a poor hobo? Misi Elza, look who's here. Papa. Ashana was no fun... - Maisa, Papa is here. She kept complaining that all her children were gone. She missed you so much. How are you? - Fine. Where is Sarith? - Asleep. You'd think she'd want to be out and about in the bustle. Wake her up, Mini-mini. My responsibility. Quick, fetch her. I have something special for her... Someone special... He's seen the world. Africa, North America, China. Can you imagine? He's planning to stay at Jews' Savannah and teach... while doing scientific research then back into the world. Fascinating. What research? He's a botanist and geologist. Studied at Oxford. And he paints and draws too. Phenomenal. He sounds like a fascinating man. He pays for the expeditions himself. Just imagine. Abraham Cohen. Sarith. That's right, isn't it Rebecca? My riding jacket. Yes, misi. And my perfume. Why are you here? - The plantation drives me mad. And if you didn't know, Rebecca is leaving to marry. What a nerve... Can you imagine their animated conversations at table? They'll be really happy: her, the professor and his Chinese. Hello Rutger. Hi Sarith. - Do you mind if I stay longer this time? Of course. That's nice, isn't it Elza? Mini-mini. Mini-mini? A white man is allowed to have a black mistress, right? Maybe he fancies a white one some time? You smart-ass. Have they slept together? - Mind your own business. My misi is so unhappy. - My misi can't help that. His masra should make your misi happy. - They're sisters. Stop it, Maisa. They're not real sisters. Your misi is so mean. She acts as if she's married to him! You should look at your own misi. This is not our fault. If our misis quarrel, we'll never see each other again. Then leave my misi alone. Or you'll have me to deal with. No one can touch your misi. But it's your misi who keeps touching my masra Rutger. You're crazy, boy. Mini-mini. Misi Elza is pregnant. I haven't washed her towels in two months. Cheers, sweetheart. Can I have some? Let's see who drinks quickest. 1, 2... No, come here. - What? You can toast like this. You call scattering coins humiliating? Elza... - Leave her be. What's wrong, misi Elza? What's wrong? We have to be strong. What do you mean? Everyone makes mistakes. And not everyone is strong enough... to face the facts... or to change their mind. You really love me? How could you ask that? I don't want to hurt Elza. And me? Elza can't give you anything I can't... better... and more often. Elza is your sister. - No... We don't share a drop of blood. She's really a total stranger. I remember how you gazed at me that first time. You wanted me. Not Elza. You... want... me. Don't dare walk away. - Please step aside. First say what you really feel for me. - Get out. Out of my house. I never want to see you again. Keep your hands off my husband. - Your husband? You think he still is? Don't touch me. Don't touch... I said: don't touch me. Let go. - Behave yourself. Behave. Now leave my house. Mini-mini, pack your misi's things and go. Are you okay? All through the rainy season, misi said less than a slave with no tongue. I can't give my misi what she needs. Because my misi certainly won't find what she needs on the plantation. There's no man here. There is no love here. There's just me here. Me, who wants my misi to laugh. Because when she laughs, she has the most-most beautiful laugh. Ashana! Your misi has a son. She has a son. You're a grandma. Tell everyone: two days off from work. Misi Sarith. Misi Elza has a baby boy. Ashana's herbs work wonders. Take some and you can come with us tomorrow. No really. You can go. I can manage here. Your child is ill. We'll stay. No, go and look at that baby. Very well. We'll leave Ashana and Mini-mini... to look after you, okay? Have a little patience. Next time you'll come with us. Now we'll leave you in peace. Come on. Sleep tight. Mini-mini? Go and wash yourself. Good morning, misi. Ashana, what are you doing? Why haven't I had any food? Shall I make you some pancakes? - Ashana! Put that vase back, Ashana, those flowers are fine. Why haven't I had any food, Ashana? - Misi, I'll make pancakes. Look at me. Masras sleep with their female slaves, right? Yes, misi. Sometimes or often? Well? Often. Yes, misi. Do you spit on the ground then too? Misi Sarith, I'll do your hair... - Shut up, I'm speaking. What did you say? What did you say? You filthy nigger. The pig says... "What is yours, stays yours." And I'm not a filthy nigger. My name is Ashana. Ashana, Ashana is the name... that I can write at last. Please misi. She's an old woman. - Whip her. Please, misi. - Whip her! Ashana... mother of Maisa... mother of Suku and Afi who died of fever and are lying in the forest... Misi, isn't that enough? Ashana, mother of Lodewijk who is cutting sugar in the fields... Ashana, grandmother of Kwalu. who died as a little boy... and is not lying in the forest, but flowing in the river... because he had to get a hat that blew off misi Rachael's head... and never came back to the surface. Ashana. I've learned to write her name. And one clay I shall write the names of all the slaves. One day I'll write what the price of sugar was. Overseer! Come quick. Come quick. Masra... Stop the mill. One day I'll write who paid the price of sugar. What have you done, in the name of God? Who gives you the right to with my slave... Who cared for Elza like her own child, my... Levi. Let go of the child. You aren't even my father. She has the right to punish a slave. The filthy nigger thought she'd insult me. I demand respect, even if she is your slave. I'll make sure you get a home in Paramaribo. I never want you at this table again. My daughter is not going to live alone in Paramaribo. She isn't a black mistress. She is less than a black mistress. Mini-mini, pack my clothes. I'm leaving now. I can go anywhere. I can get any man I want. Any man. Come on, darling. Since the unfortunate death of your wife, production has declined dramatically. Alex. The figures are awful, Mr Robles, you're bankrupt. If the bank gives you a loan... A last loan. Very well, very well. Who did you have in mind... as overseer? You're looking at him. But you're retiring, I understood. Alex will be your new overseer. Sit down. A negro? It wasn't my idea. It was Rutger's idea. I thought it was ridiculous, but he convinced me. Don't ask me how, but Alex learnt to calculate. He can even read. He has the brains of a white man... in the body of a negro. Right? Look at it that way. Right, yes. You'll pay Alex off in 5 years. Once he's a free negro, he'll get a normal salary. Those are the conditions. Read them. And this... Alex? You suggest I come again to sort out... - Yes, certainly, goodbye. Miss Sarith, what a surprise. Mr Robles, how nice to see you. I have something to celebrate. I think. May I invite you for a drink? No, thank you. Some other time. Some other time. Goodbye. Why are you here? They say his wallet is as big as his nose. I asked what you wanted. Can we talk somewhere? In my office. You two stay here. If you're here for financial matters, then... - Are the rumours I hear true? Are you going to Holland? I'm going to Amsterdam for a year. This is your last chance. And then to Berlin to negotiate with the WIC... Elza can survive. There are enough boring rich men here. Wake up. I'm staying with the Ledesmas. I'm ready for Europe, Holland or wherever the wind takes us. But the wind to take misi Sarith away from Suriname, it never came. And misi Elza and masra Rutger left. Not for a year. But for always. I heard they went to Rome... and that it snowed in Amsterdam. I don't know what snow is. But they say it makes you happy. I wish it would snow here. That all of the snow in the world would fall on my head here in Paramaribo. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Robles. - Miss Sarith. Oh God, what have I done? What have you done? What have I done. How very clumsy of me. I don't want to upset you. Miss Sarith, it's not out of my way at all. You're a real gentleman. You made this a very special evening. - So did you. I'd love to see Little Paradise. You're always welcome to come and stay. I have a guest room. Yes... Yes, that's possible. - Yes? Well, tell me when it's convenient. Why stay if we could get married? The lady has taste and intelligence. This is my most beautiful jewel. - Mini-mini, tie it for me. It's beautiful, but this is also excellent quality... and slightly less conspicuous. I can recommend that. Not for a wedding, but for a funeral. You like it? Lovely, isn't it? Cut from the very best wood. The cabinet is new too. For your dresses. You can go now, Mini-Mini. - No. Mimi has to take down my hair. - I can do that. You can go, Mini-mini. We want to be alone. Ach Julius, already... Never mind. Let's go to sleep. We're both tired... Masra Julius stopped drinking... and did everything all to make misi Sarith happy. Awa... Can you clean this? Brush off the leaves. But Little Paradise hardly saw misi Sarith. Why so much hurry? We can go next month together? - We can. Misi Sarith often went to stay in Paramaribo... to find fabric for new curtains, that became new dresses. And masra Julius worked hard-hard and always said "yes" to misi Sarith. Masra Julius wanted to turn Little Paradise into Grand Paradise. Welcome. If your mother or sister came, you could stay here. In this mess? You want to shame me before my family? I can't do everything. Anyway the living room, veranda, your bedroom... these are surely... The curtains. You were going to... - Now it's my fault this place is a pigsty? If I'd known this beforehand... Thank you. I realise you have to adjust. - I need a pied-a-terre in Paramaribo. All normal planters have one. We have to be frugal, don't we? Just listen to that Alex. Soon the slaves will be better off than me. That's unreasonable. - Unreasonable? You should think before marrying a young woman. You had your life. I want one too. Calm down, dear. You've only been back a few days. I understand someone going crazy here. I can. Don't say it... - I understand why your wife killed herself. When do you want to go? Everything okay? Should I worry? -It'll be all right, masra. Quickly... Can't we call him William, Arthur or something else modern? But Jethro is a name from the Torah. It means grand. That's what our love brought. Something grand I never dared hope would happen. A son. Mama! Beautiful. Go show it to your daddy. What is it, boy? That's really lovely. I don't have a plate. Yes, misi. Jethro. You want to come and fry pancakes? Alex... From the Loan Bank. Masra Rutger. You're free. Congratulations. It's too dangerous for you and Jethro here. Alex is here. And the army is two hours away. The maroons aren't crazy. What's the matter with you then? - Women's things. Please... I'll be myself in a week. You have business in Paramaribo. That's more important. Get well soon. Anything I can do for you, misi? At last. Come here. We came to free you! We came to free you! Keep calm. - Don't resist. We won't hurt you. Sit down, all of you. Where are the whites? Where are the white men? Help! Maroons! Come on. Take the spade. - No forest for me. Go on inside. Hide, hurry. Come on now. Go on, inside! What are you doing? Stop them! Come on, get them. What are you doing here, Hendrik? This is not your house. Hendrik. Go away. Get out of here, Hendrik! Get out of here, Hendrik! There's a white man! Maroons. Quick. - Go, go. Misi, hide. - Come! Come on, misi. - Come and hide. In the closet. Go on. Inside. Where are the whites? - They're not here. They left by boat for Paramaribo. I'm here alone. Don't kill me. Spare me. Look yourself. The boat has gone. They left. But I know where the drink is. I can show you. Bring the food and drink here. No, go. Come down with me. Stop griping, woman. Hurry. Caesar... That white misi? - The oldies say she went to Paramaribo. But I'm not so sure. That one futuboi didn't see her on the boat. Look in the slave quarters. Go and look in the slave quarters. I want to whip her to death. - Yes, let's whip her. Whip her to death, like she did grandma Ashana. Darling. Darling, come here. I'm talking to you. Come here to me. Have you been broken open? Gimme a kiss. What are you up to? What were you planning to do? Don't touch me. Leave her alone. Who do you think you are? Filthy devil. Learning white man's bad manners'? You're a beast just like them? You talk too much. Give me the girl. What are you going to do? If you want to break a woman open, break me open. No, don't touch me. Leave me alone. Take me. - What are you doing? Here. You can massage my back. Go away, woman. Hey, don't behave like a pig. Wake up. Hurry. Take what you want. Are you coming too? Grandma, grandma. Grandma. Come with me. Go on. We're going to burn the house down. Come down with me. No... No. Don't set fire to it. Look what you're doing. No, no fire. No, don't set fire to it. Grandma, get out now. You have to get out. Don't do it. Don't. Don't wear that. - What are you doing? You can't wear white men's things. Stop. Where did that child come from? I had to take care of the boy. - Who else is back there? Mini-mini... Where were you? - I didn't know... Come with me. - No, let go. Come, or you'll burn. It's burning. Are you crazy? I won't. - I'll free you. You're free. I don't want you. I want Hendrik. But that man is long gone. Soldiers. Soldiers. Go inside. Sarith. Jethro. Where is mama? Where is Sarith? Upstairs? Outside, outside. Water, blankets. Put out the fire. How long was this going on? How long? Does masra want a drink? As long as Jethro? As long as Jethro? Don't get mad at misi Sarith. She made mistakes, but she's still young. Did the maroons leave any drink? I need some. No wine, no cognac? They took it all, masra. Shall I make you some sugar water? Can someone be honest with me? Your misi... Did she have many lovers? How many men were there... since we married? How many? - Masra, may I not answer? It's good to be honest but sometimes it's better to stay silent. Why do you defend your misi? Why? However many mistakes she makes? Why? It's how it is. My misi is all there is. There's nothing else. But you know the difference between good and evil, don't you? Misi Sarith isn't bad or wrong. Misi Sarith... is unhappy. I don't want her to be unhappy. I want her laughing and cheerful. You know how beautiful she is then. You're too good for your misi. I think it's best if you go to Paramaribo right away. It's not you. I hope you're sensible enough not to disgrace my name. Tell Mini-mini to pack my things. - Mini-mini is staying. I'll call another slave. Mini-mini has to look after Jethro. - That's why she's staying. I'd never been without my misi for more than one day. I did not know how misi felt or what she wanted to eat. Misi Sarith slowly faded from my thoughts. You want that? Shall I do it? Shall we ask Mini-mini to eat with us? Shall we ask? - Yes. Mini-mini... Yes, masra. - Would you lay another place? Mini-mini, come here. There's just a few mistakes. Look. The "t" has to be the other way round. You see? Now you. Like that? Mini-mini... may I kiss you? If you don't want, I won't do anything. I want you to stay the mother of my son... who is not my son and you're not the mother... but he's still our child. But masra... It's not good... I don't know what to do any more than you. Really. Hello, misi. Is misi eating too? I'll lay a place for you. Hello, misi. Say hello to your mama. Jethro, go and wash your hands and face first. You stay here. Why are you here? Why didn't you inform us? I'm coming to live here again. We're married, remember? Why is she wearing a blouse? Mini-mini look at me. Look me in the eye and dare to lie to me. Why are you wearing my blouse? - Leave her out of this. This doesn't involve her, but you. And maybe me. Leave her out of it. What do you want to know? If you think you can take that slave as your mistress... and humiliate me in front of everyone, you're wrong. Mini-mini is not my mistress. Mini-mini is my love. As if you know anything about love. As if you know anything about... desire, yearning, pain... humiliation, self-hatred. You're so boring. What do you want to do? Put me in the slave quarters? Let me sleep by the door on a mat? Then I come into the bedroom to wipe your sperm off her face? What do you want? We going to Paramaribo as soon as possible. We'll have our marriage annulled. Our marriage that you never respected. I'll bear the financial consequences and hope you find a new love soon... and that you'll be happy. And Jethro? You never cared about that boy. You want my house... my honour, my child? To take it all? - No. I give you back your life. The life you seem to want. Freedom. Don't think you're rid of me easily. Jethro is my child. Mine and... -and mine. Check the birth certificate. Is that how you want to play it? This is the way. Respecting the law... and for contract. And respecting you. Believe me when I wish you the best. I hope you find someone to be happy with. As happy as you are now? Just as happy as me. With my slave. With Mini-mini. And you? Are you happy too? Yes, misi... I can't hear you. What did you say? Yes. I -am -happy... with Julius. All good things come from France. Excuse me for leaving your wonderful company. We have old Dutch stewed pears for dessert! I have a headache. Nothing serious. I'll lie down. That's a great pity. But you're staying, right? I'll do anything for stewed pears. Mr Van Beunekom? Where is Mini-mini? No idea. What? Where is she? How should I know? She's my slave. I can do with her as I please. If you touched her... - I sold her. Who to? Who to? - Let go of me. To a trader. No idea of his name. Don't you have any illusions. She's been sold on! Masra van Beunekom took her with him. Is Van Beunekom here? - Auction's closed. Open on Friday. Is Van Beunekom inside? These are freshwater neg roes. They arrived yesterday. I doubt she's here. What's the name? - I'll pay you. How much? Say what you want. You or one of your men picked her up from the Ledesmas. Tell me where she is, please! What do you think? We're a respectable trading house. Don't try and bribe me. - You misunderstand. I want her back. I have money. - Calm down. Just act normally. I didn't tell you. Money. Try the Smuggler's Field. But hurry. I think they're sailing today. Make sure you have enough money. She's worth 500. You're paying for two. How come? She's pregnant. Can I have a word? If you take what's yours, I'll take mine. - Let go of me. Let go of me. What are you doing? Let go. Come on, get out. Hey, you look nice. Come. Come on. One after the other, in line. Stop here. Mouth open. Open your mouth. And what have we here? Come here, then. That's one nice blouse. Nothing for a slave to wear. Take it off. What do you want? Who are you? That slave... she's me. I have no time. We're leaving. Wait, wait. Let go of him. That's enough for a slave. You want to insult me? What's that? Give me. Here are my rings. Here you are. Here you are. People like you are a pestilence. You don't realise the significance of superiority in God's creation? Let her go. My name is Mini-mini... daughter of Kwasiba... granddaughter of Kwemba. I'm the mother of Jethro who isn't my blood but is my child. I'm the mother of Nina who is my blood. She's mine and Julius'. And another child is growing in me. I live with my children's father at Brickmakers Creek in Paramaribo. Their family name is Robles Medina. I'm a free coloured. I am Mini-mini. I came at once. How is he? You want to be alone with him? Julius, Sarith is here. He'll be all right. He's a strong boy. He couldn't have had a better mother. I couldn't have had a better friend. I'm sorry. Please... can you forgive me? I can't forgive you. You will have to do that yourself.
