Girl! Get up! Girl, it's still early! Five more minutes. But girl, we need to be at the venue by 2 p.m. Wake up, girl! Analyn's probably panicking. Come on, girl! Wake up! Are you awake? Obviously! Your loud voice probably woke up the entire town. Well and good! Good morning, Dali! Here's coffee and bread to start your day. Thank you, Marga. - I'll have some. - You're welcome. What's that? Can I see? I'm sure this will look really good. But I'm not satisfied yet. I've done it repeatedly. Take your time. A masterpiece shouldn't be rushed. Good thing Marga knows what a masterpiece is. I can't see Analyn wearing it. Maybe you need a new muse. A new inspiration. Maybe she's right here. You just haven't noticed. Girl, double time! Analyn's keeps checking up. Romy, Dali isn't a "girl." Stop calling him that. Girl, drink that coffee. That should wake you up! So soft, so smooth. Didn't you say I'm a loser? That I shouldn't even try to look pretty? With my thick eyebrows And the color of my skin Girl! Where are you? I'm coming! I'm coming out. Stop it. Dali is straight. Straight as a ruler. Hello, my sisters! Dali. Straight as a ruler? Or straight as a tape measure? Good morning! Good morning! Fabulous! Gorgeous! Now, what can you say? There! A goddess! - Dali. - Mom. Fab! Fab! Go, go, go! [indistinct chatter] Good morning, Dad! Good morning, Dali! Gorgeous! Okay, there we go. - Beautiful! - Look at that! You two are brilliant! Dad! Fab! Fab! Go, go, go! I'm sure Dali is straight. He's just a bit soft. As soft as this makeup sponge? That's harsh. Now, what can you say? Bye, girls! Bye, mother! Finally, we're on our way! - At last! - Where's our ride? - Where is it? - Romy, where is it? - What? - Our ride? - You mean the one we booked? - Don't ask me! Ask her! - Why me? I already did my part. - Sis, you did nothing! Fine, I'll do it! Girl! See? So gay, yet so dumb. Excuse me? Are you calling me dumb? Hey, Humpty Dumpty. I'll get back at you when I'm not so busy. - Waiting! - Let's go, sissies! - Let's go. - Analyn is calling me! Hold on. Will you please help me? Goddess Whoa, whoa, whoa I am a goddess You said then, whoa I am a goddess Where is Analyn? I don't know where that girl is. Have you texted her? - Yes, I have. She's been looking for us. - That girl is hard to dress up. Come on! Sis, let's look over there. Oh my God! Sorry. Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram [screams] Gel, what have you done? OMG! OMG! I'm so sorry. - OMG, girl! - Are you okay? We didn't bring an extra gown! Don't worry, we'll fix this. - Come with me. - What happened?! Wait! May I help you? There. Just one final touch. Girl, I'm nervous! Close your eyes. Relax, Analyn. You can do it! Girl, where's my gown? Did you finish it? The gown that will end all gowns. Where is it? I'll wear it when I audition for Miss NCR. Yes, I already have a concept. Close your eyes. Analyn, before you close your eyes, look at your gown for tonight. - It's beautiful, Dali! - He made it. - Thank you. - So, sissies, make sure I'll win Miss Manila. You can help me win, right? You can make me win, right, sissies? Analyn, we are your glam team. We're not the judges. And we're not Jesus. But we will try our best, Analyn. Promise. Okay? Please try your best too. Especially in the question and answer portion. Okay? Let's practice. How are you, Analyn? I'm fine. Thank you. - Nice. - Wow. Good start! Okay, so the question is... - Oh, there's more? - Yes. - What is the essence of being a woman? - There you go. - The essence of being a woman... - Yes. Girl, next question! That's difficult. But it's one of the most common questions. Fine. Let's try this one. Analyn, what makes you blush? Putting blush on. Sis, she has a point. Putting blush on, it is. - All right. Valid answer. - My answer is correct, isn't it? - I'm just stating the facts. - I'll just rely on my beauty to win. It's a beauty contest, anyway, and not a quiz bowl. Hello! Do you happen to have an extra gown and an available makeup artist? I need one ASAP. - [indistinct chatter] - Do you need help? Angel? Freddie, it's not working. Let me try. Hi. Hi. I'm Dali. Hi, Dali. I am a makeup artist and fashion designer. I think I can help you. Can you make a gown? As in, right now? I got you. A makeup? That's going to be hard to remove. - What? - Hey! Are you sure you know what you're doing? Freddie, he looks like he does. Let him be. Scissors. Scissors?! - It's sabotage. - Hello. Love it? Girl, get me a ride. I want to go home. Girl, no. Fight for a spot in the top 15. There are only 16 contestants. Girl, let's do your makeup. You have the face of an angel. This won't take long. Let's put your makeup on? I'll apply this moisturizer. Just so the makeup will set. Don't worry. This is hypoallergenic. Flamboyant moisturizer. So soft... So smooth. This is it. The moment you've been waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen, your top three in Miss Manila! To the other ladies, thank you very much. You may proceed backstage. Candidate number five is a strong contender. She's gorgeous. All of them look gorgeous. The question is, who's got the brains? Congratulations, candidate number five. Thank you so much. I'm just curious. Your gown looks exquisite. What's the story behind your gown? Who's your designer? Some misfortunes are really just blessings in disguise. All we need is to open our eyes, be resourceful, be optimistic, and you can turn a disaster into a masterpiece. What a long answer. And this flamboyant gown was made by a flamboyant designer. His name is Dali. Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Thank you very much. Candidate number five. And now, the time has come to crown our next Miss Manila! And she's none other than Candidate number... Five! Congratulations, Candidate Number Five for winning this year's Miss Manila. Ladies and Gentlemen, a big round of applause for our new queen. Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram Sharam daram daram - Dali! Thank you. - Hey! No biggie. Congratulations! I won because of you. You're brilliant! Nope. It was all you. You were great. By the way, this is my team: Romy, Marga, and Analyn, also a candidate. - Hi! - Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you, Dali! May I get your number? My number? I want to hire you as my makeup artist for my next pageant. Hold on. That also has the address of our salon and boutique. Thank you! You gays are really a blessing to us girls. Oops, I forgot to return this. You can keep it. I have a lot of those. Okay. Thank you! - Let's go? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Dali, thank you! I love you! Bye! - Bye! Take care! - Bye! You too, take care. She said she loves me. Is that for real? As if. So soft. So smooth. Good morning, girl! Good morning! Wow, looks like our girl is making some progress. This looks nice! I'm inspired. Inspired? You mean, by Angel? I found the one. As if. - [indistinct chatter] - Do you like it? Smile! There you go! Dali, you look inspired. Fabulous! - Dali. - Dad. Fab! Fab! Go, go, go! [indistinct chatter] Dali, your aura is different. Of course, Mom. Fab! Fab! Go, go, go! Girl! Wow! Girl isn't lovesick anymore. You know it! Careful with this gas tank, sissies. He might explode. Please be seated. Let's eat and be eaten. Delicious! Dad, I think our dearest child is in love. Watch out. He might bring his boyfriend here soon. - What's up? - Hey! Hello, babe! You gays are too much! - Why so disgusted? - Am I too dirty for you?! - Exactly. You're just jealous! - No way! Babe, how's your office? It's going great, babe. I might be getting a promotion. I love you. I love you too. That's my man! Congratulations! Dali? Dad? It looks like you're busy. Dad, someone special will be here tomorrow. Are you dating someone? We're not a couple, yet. You mean it's just a fling? Or a fubu? No. I have plans to court this special someone. So sweet. Courting? Is that still a thing? Of course. At least it is to me. I want to court this person. But I don't know how. How about a pair of rubber shoes as a gift? - Fight! - You know it! [indistinct chatter] - Good idea! - In fairness, you got that one. But I don't think this person is into rubber shoes. How about a motorbike? - That will be awesome! - Perfect! I don't think so, Veronica. Money? For sure! Final answer. Money! - Yes! - Right! No! I mean... Where did you meet this person? I know! On Grindr? Not on Grindr! We met at a beauty pageant. Wait! A makeup artist, or a designer? Nope. A candidate. Since when did you start working for male beauty pageants? Dad, my special someone is a girl. What? What do you mean? I want to date girls. And why would you date girls? Because I like girls? Wait. How could you like girls when you're gay? Dad, I'm not gay. Dali, we accept you for who you are. You don't have to pretend. We are one, big, gay family. - Yes! - Truth! Dad, I know. I know. But I've always been straight. Since forever. And now... I think... I found the girl for me. It's Angel. Angel? Who's Angel? You know what? She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Wait, Dali. Whenever we see beautiful girls, we dress them up, right? Right! - We design and make clothes for them. - Right! But we don't date them. Dad, I love her. And I found the one. This cannot be! You're not straight! I don't have a straight child! You're gay! Jaime! Sit down! You're such a drama queen. Dad. I cannot change who I am. I am straight. Babe, if he says he is straight, then we should let him be. Are you sure, Anakshie? You're straight? Don't you think it might just be a phase? But you're too talented to be straight! True. Dad, I know. I am straight. And I am in love. As if. So, are you okay with it? I don't know why Dali is still in denial. We love him. We accept him. I don't know either, Jaime. Maybe our child really is straight. Drop it, Gemma. Our child is gay. I was even more straight than he is when I was his age. Yes, you were! That's why I fell in love with you. FYI, I was already gay then. I was just closeted. I didn't want to make it obvious because my dad and my uncle were in the military. But I already knew back then that I was gay. Maybe Dali's different. Maybe he doesn't know his true identity yet. He most certainly does. He's just hiding it. But he doesn't have to hide anything. We live in a parlor and fashion boutique. Guys, gays, lesbians, or whatever he likes, he's still our child. If he says that he is Batman, then we let him be Batman. We cannot do anything about it. I just don't want him to have the same experience as I did. Why? What did you experience? You're lucky. You have me in your life. Silly! You're the reason why I turned gay. I got traumatized. Hey, come on! That's so dirty! Stop overreacting! You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for You are the one who brought color to my world I hope that this will last forever You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for You are the one who brought color to my world I hope that this will last forever Oh my lady, you are the one I want to spend my whole life with Girl! Girl! What?! Angel's here! Move it! - She's waiting for you outside! Ouch! - Angel is here? OMG! Romy! I'm not ready! Tell her I'm just taking a bath, okay? Okay. Move faster! I'm just taking a bath, okay? Okay. - Girl, you're so late. Hurry up. - Bruno, you have big biceps! They'll get bigger once I start bulking up. Do you have abs too? Your brother is such a jock, Angel. Right? Hi, Dali! I like it here. Dali, you didn't tell me that Angel was so gorgeous. Thank you. Dali, this is my brother, Bruno. Bruno, this is Dali. Hi, bro! What's up, sissy? Let's go? We don't want to be late. Okay, sure. Let's go. Bye, Dad. Before you leave, Dali. Oh, right! Fab! Fab! Go, go, go! - They're so cute! - Let's go. - Bye! - Bye! Take care! Bye! So that's why Dali fell for Angel. Is it because Angel is beautiful? Because the brother is handsome. Thank you, girl. Hi, bro! What's with the face? Bro! This is Dali, my makeup artist. Dali, this is Gardo, my brother. What's up? I'm good, bro. Hey! Are you using my clothes again without my permission?! Who cares? - You want to fight?! - Come on! I'll beat you up. You want me to show you? So, Dali, this is our gym. And this is my brother Rob. Bruno manages our gym. Catch you later, coach! Rob, this is Dali, my makeup artist. Dali, this is Rob, my brother. Nice outfit, Dali! Pretty as a girl. Take it easy, bro. Are you okay? Come back here after you're done with Angel's makeup. I'll hook you up with some guys. Hey! That's so tactless of you. Nikko hooks up with gays. Just give him 150 pesos, and he's all yours. Hey... Bro, please don't treat Dali like that. That's so embarrassing. Is Dad home yet? Yes, he's already inside. Okay. We'll go ahead. Let's go. Coach! Those all belong to my dad. Really? Angel? Where's your mom? Sis, she passed away when I was a kid. Come on. Let's go upstairs. Angel? - I want to tell you something. - What is it? I am not... Dad! Hi! Who's this? This is Dali, my new makeup artist. Oh, Dali. He helped me during the pageant. You are really good at that. But I'm not... You're good. Okay. Thank you, Uncle. What did you say? Thank you, Uncle. What "uncle"? I'm a Coach. Can't you see? Okay, Coach. So, welcome to my room. It's so hot. Come in, Dali. It's my friend's birthday party, later. I want to look good. So... Come on, let's start! Dali, I'd like to apologize for my dad and my brothers. They're just protective of me. No worries. They are good people. Let it dry. If you're eyeing a guy at the gym, just let me know. I'll hook you up. What? Well, you know what... Dali, don't tell me you're eyeing one of my brothers? You have no chance. They're super straight. I am not gay. Huh? I am not gay. What? I am not gay. So, what are you? - I am... - Pansexual? Fluid? Bi? I'm straight. Mmm. How do you know that you're straight? Close your eyes, please. I am a guy who doesn't like guys. Straight. A guy who likes a girl. You mean, you like to dress girls up and put makeup on them, right? Well... Yes. I like to put makeup on girls and dress them up. Girls like you. Oh! Thank you, girl! You know what, it's fine. We have our own ways of coming out. You know Freddie? He came out just last year. He had been in denial for so long. So don't worry, okay? Whenever you're ready I'll be here for you. I'll be your friend. Okay? Thank you. Thanks, bro. Angel, I'll pick you up at 12 midnight, okay? Bro, just make it 1 o'clock? 12:30. Bro, just 1 o'clock, please? I'm with Dali. Right, Dali? Are you sure? I'm not wearing the right outfit. Sis, you look fine. Angel. Hey, you! Take care of my sister, okay? - I'm not ga... - Hi, handsome. - Happy birthday! - Thank you for coming. And in fairness, you have a nice outfit! Thank you so much! You said you'd invite Diego? Yes, I did invite him for you. This is Dali. He's my new BFF, stylist, and makeup artist. In fairness, you have great taste in choosing your outfits. Your outfit looks great! Love it, bitch. Thank you. And, bitches, let's go! Diego has been waiting for you. Let's go girls. You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for You are the one who brought color to my world I hope that this will last forever You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for You are the one who brought color to my world I hope that this will last forever The shape of your body is mesmerizing The twinkle in your eyes is so beautiful Cannot help it. I can stare all night long I will never lose interest You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for You are the one who brought color to my world I hope that this will last forever Oh my lady, you are the one I choose From the beginning until the end of my love You are the only one in my dreams I want to spend my life with you, it's making me crazy Would you like something to drink? Yes, please. - Okay. - Thank you. Bro. Hey, Dali. - Hi. - Good thing you're here. Yes. Angel brought me with her. I'm happy that you're here. Let's have a shot! Sir, can I have some? Come on! Shot? Oh, you don't drink? All right then. Good. Just one shot. Shot? So, Dali, are you single? Yes, but I have a crush on someone. Really? Why don't you ask him out? What's your type? Twinks? Jocks? Bears? What? I don't know. Are you a top or a bottom? Hey! Hello. Hi! - Take it. It's yours. - Let's dance? Who's that? Who? Diego? He looks good. And he's also hot. But he's straight. I don't care. Oh, what a fighter. They're so sweet with each other. Well, they had a thing. Waiter! - What are you doing? - Babe. I just went out for a bit. Babe, please. Don't be jealous. We're just friends. Don't touch me. Babe, will you please stop? It's embarrassing. I'm sorry, I have to go. Look after Angel, okay? Angel, that's enough. Are you okay? Drink some water. Of course. Of course I'm okay. He's just a guy. There are plenty of guys out there. Right, girl? Right. And I'm a catch, right? Angel, you're the most beautiful woman here. Thank you, girl. But... I don't know why I can't move on from Diego. We never became a couple. I don't know why I'm still not over him. That's just the way it is. We all have our own timing. We all have our own process. You'll move on in time. I know why I can't move on from him. Have you seen his muscles? I feel like he can keep me safe all my life. Angel, you don't need someone to protect you. I mean, look at you. You are so beautiful. You're so smart. You're strong. Thank you, girl. If you were straight, I'd think that you liked me. -I told you. I am not ga- -Thank you. Thank you so much for listening to me. You gays are really something. Angel, I am not gay. Dali. Hey. See this? I have muscles too. Angel, I can keep you safe as well. I can also protect you. Dali. You know what else? I'll remove all of these. Just so I can prove to you that I am not gay. - Let me help you... - No. I can manage. This is so annoying. Let me help you. Angel, I am not gay. And yes. I like you. Thank you. I like you too. Thanks for being my friend.

There you go! Nice! Nice one! Push, push, push! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, man! Just wait until I've had my coffee. Looking good! You look like a straight guy! Thank you. I am a straight guy. I'm sorry about last night. I got so drunk. It's fine. Don't worry about it. But I still remember everything that we talked about. About being straight, pansexual, fluid, and bi. Angel, I'm straight. Okay. Do you believe that I am straight? Dali, if you say you're straight, then you're straight. Thank you. Besides, you are still a talented makeup artist and designer. So, tell me about it. Why the look change? Angel, I've already told you before. It's been a while. I'm here because... I want to ask if I can... Oh my God! Do you want to do my makeup? - I actually got shortlisted for Miss NCR. - Wow! Oh my gosh! - No! - No? I mean, yes! I want to do your makeup. But also... But not only that. Oh my God! Do you want to design my gown as well? Dali, please! You're a lifesaver! - No. - No? I mean, yes. I want to do your makeup and I want to design your gown. But I also want to say something. Wait, Dali. Let me show you something. Follow me! - Angel! - Yes? Yes, I want to do your makeup. I want to transform your already gorgeous face. I want to make it even better. I want to style you. Make beautiful gowns for you. I want to dress you up, Angel. But, aside from all of that... I also want... you to be my girlfriend. Come on! We're girl friends, Dali. Not like that. That's not what I mean. I meant, girlfriend. As in girlfriend, no space. Huh? Angel. I want to court you. As in date you. Oh. Okay. All right, Dali. But you also need to court them, okay? My dad and my brothers. Okay? Okay. Okay. Yay! Yay! Dali. Have you eaten? Yes. Mom. Dali. Are you okay? Yes, I am. In fairness, your new look's pretty good. Do I look handsome? Do you want to be handsome? Kind of. If you want to be handsome today, and then be pretty tomorrow... Whatever it is that you want, go ahead. Thank you, Mom. Dali, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we were insisting that you were gay. Just give your dad some time. I'm sure he'll understand you. He loves you. We love you. I love you both, Mom. I have a new love. Angel? Mom, I want to court Angel. - Can you give me some tips? - Goodness! How did Dad court you? He didn't court me. I was the one who courted him. Dali, love requires a lot of hard work. But I am sure Angel will like you. Your good looks will surely help you. Girl, I'm warning you. Perfect. Good morning, Dali. - Good morning. - Bread and coffee to start your day. Thank you. I'm on a diet. In fairness... Fit. Hot. Let's go, bro! You can do it! There! Yeah, boy. What's up, bro? Let's go make some gains! Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go! Hi, bro. Need a hand? Can you change car tires? Yes, I can. Okay. Do it. All right. Do it quickly, okay? You have a gig scheduled next week, right? You're still up for it, right? Do it without me. You'll be fine. But you're the one who took that gig, right? Can you do it? Lightweight, boy! Lightweight! Go, Dali! There you go! Nice one, bro! Yes! Gains! Yes! Score, boy! What's the perfect color blend? Code 213 light and Code 209? I don't think so. Oh, I know! 210. It's a perfect match for you. 203 plus 217, medium-light. 203 plus 217. Such a poser! Hey, what happened? His girlfriend left him for another guy. Are you all right? What, are you gay? Boys don't cry, bro. Don't cry! Crybabies aren't allowed here. Right, Dali? - Yes. What are you, gay? - Hey. - Just lift your pain away. - Right! - Get up and lift! - Come on! - Show him how it's done, Dali. - Game! Straight. Jab-straight. Hey, Dali! We'll play basketball later.

You're not supposed to grab the ball, bro! Just give this one to me! Hey. He's not the enemy! He's our teammate! What are you doing, Dali?! - Hey! - Hey! - Yes! - What are you doing?! Dali. Have a drink. You look so haggard. Thank you. You know what, Dali? You're talented. You don't need to be good at playing basketball. - Really? - Yes. My brothers are good basketball players. So don't try to match their skills. Sit this one out. Let's just watch them play. Dali, last game! Last game. Are you sure? Where are you going? Where are you going? Shoot it! Defense! Jackpot! Nice shot! He's just lucky! Follow him! Hard defense! Got you! He got me there. Nice one, Dali! We can do this! Defense! Shoot it! Go, Dali! Go, Dali! Let's go! Bro! Oh no! You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for Oh my God! Dali! I'm so proud of you! You are the girl I desire A girl so beautiful that I've prayed for How's my makeup? It looks okay. Why don't you want to do my makeup? It's not that I don't want to. It's just that I don't like doing it anymore. It's a thing of the past now. Okay. Fine. Oops! Don't use that. That's dirty now. Try this one. This one. Neutral Code 265. That one is still clean. Okay. What layer should I apply next? Code 265. Contour palette. Oh, Code 265, nose line. Dali... Mmm? I feel nervous. What if I don't reach the final round of the pageant? You know what? You'll win for sure. The shade of your makeup and the gown you wear don't matter. Because you are beautiful, Angel. Inside and out. But I still feel nervous. Especially in the question and answer portion. Can we practice it? Sure. Question number one: What is the essence of being a woman? Okay, hold on. Too easy. Okay, wait. Here it goes: As a woman, what do you think is the essence of a real man? Thank you so much for that wonderful question. But it's a difficult one. Let me think about it for a minute. How about you? Why me? You're the one who should be answering it. What is the essence of a real man? I don't know. Maybe... To love someone truly and deeply. That's so corny! Let me just put my lipstick on. Then we can go. So you're straight, Dali. We thought you were gay. Sorry. I'm very straight. Okay. Straight. Hi, Angel! Hi, Diego! How are you and your girlfriend? We already broke up. I'm with Dali tonight. Yeah, we've met. Hi, bro! Looking good, bro. There are a lot of cute guys here. Actually, I have a cute gay cousin. If you want, I can set up a date for you. This is him. Your cousin looks like a navel. No, bro. I'm good. I'm not into dudes. What? Sorry, I thought... What? You thought I'm gay? He thought I was gay. Bro, I'm straight as fuck! - Yeah. - I love cars. I even lift, brother. Yeah. Do you even lift? Of course, bro. What's your personal record on the deadlift? 150. Same, same. Pounds, right? Kilos, bro. - Kilos? - Yeah. Kilos, same. We're the same. - You were just mistaken. - Kilos. Bro, I'm really sorry. I genuinely thought you were part of the LGBT community. No worries, bro. Like I said, I'm straight as... Girl! Girl! Girl! - Girl! - I think he's calling you. - He's not my friend. - Hey, girl! Girl! Girl! Girl! Hey! Why are you ignoring me? How have you been, girl? What are you doing here? Hi. I'm with friends. Gosh! What happened to your voice? Why is it husky? Are you sick? I'm so confused! Is this your boyfriend? - Oh my God! You look good together! - No, no, no. No. No. He's my bro. My soon-to-be gym bro. - Bro. - Yeah. - Bro. - Bro. What is that? Bro. Hi, Coach! Bro! - Take a seat, Dali. - Okay. Angel will come down in a bit. All right. You know what, Dali? I admire you. You know how to play the game. I respect your strategy. What do you mean, Coach? Don't deny it. You pulled a fast one on us. You're playing gay so you can win our sister. So you can get past us. Brilliant. It's a brilliant move. I'll use the same strategy to court chicks next time. Yes, girl! Yes, queen! But I am not ga... You got pranked! I'm such a clever guy! Good evening! It's time to eat dinner, Angel. Okay, Dad. Angel. It seems like Dali is really serious about dating you. Are you really serious? Very. Well then, I need to meet Dali's family. What? Because I want to know what kind of family you have. Okay? Okay. You may be seated. Let's eat and be eaten. Dig in. Your house looks amazing. A barbershop outside and a boutique inside. Our house is similar. We have a car repair shop outside and a fitness gym inside. That's because I love sports and drag racing. Drag race? I love it too. Dali loves it too. Especially season nine and the roses reveal in the finale. It was lovely, right? What did you say? Nothing. Dig in. By the way, how long have you been married? Around 25 years. Right? Wow, quite a long time. Going strong! Not really. We actually want to annul our marriage. Hey! That's painful. Dali, Angel, if you have plans of marrying each other, make sure that you know each other well. An annulment is expensive. But Uncle, why would we file for an annulment when we're not even married yet? Then, let's get married. Wait. What marriage? We just want to meet Dali's family. That's why we're here. Besides, Dali and Angel's relationship will grow deeper. You mean Bruno and Dali? Yes! I am close with Dali. We're actually gym bros. Right, Dali? Right, bro. - Give me a fist bump. - Fist bump. We're also close with each other. Right, bro? Fist bump. Bro, fist bump. Dali. I didn't know that you were into 'fisting'. What I meant was Dali and Angel. Yes, he's into beautiful girls. Like father, like son, I guess. Babe! Wow, what's the occasion? Babe, guess what... I got the promotion! Really? Congratulations! Hi! I am Boyet. Let's eat. Come on. Babe, Angel's family. Hello. Hi! Bro, this is Boyet. Dad, don't. My boyfriend. Aren't you married to her? Yes, I am married to Gemma. But we're not a couple anymore. Because I already have Boyet. Bro... I am gay. All of us in this house are gay. I am gay. My boyfriend is gay. She's also gay in spirit. And Dali here is... A good fellow! Bro, you're okay with gay men, right? Yes, I am. As long as they don't touch me. What a prick. As if every gay man wants to take advantage of him. I doubt if he can still get it up down there. Let's eat. Both the ugly ones and the good-looking ones. Let's have a feast! Just kidding. I want some hotdogs! Thank you. Now I can take you back out. I had to hide you for so long. Dad, all I was asking for, was for you to act straight. Just for one night. But you couldn't do it. What do you mean? I welcomed Angel's family into our home, didn't I? You did? Didn't I tell you to hide your... Hide my what? Your gayness! Well, they are in my house so they have no choice but to accept all the gayness. You couldn't have pretended even just for tonight? Just one night. Do you even know how traumatic hiding in the closet is for me, Dali? You can't just tell me to hide like it's that easy. Dad, it was for me. It was for me and for Angel. You're too obsessed with Angel. Look at yourself. Have you even been doing your skincare routine? You look horrible. Your skin is already dry and dull. You need a moisturizer. Look at your pores, they're so big already. And let's not forget the bags beneath your eyes. Is that what you call love? Dali, you don't really love Angel because... Because? Because? I am gay? You know what, Dad? I'm not sure if you will ever accept that I am not gay. I am not like you. I am straight and I love Angel. This is me, Dad. This is who I am, whether you accept it or not. I am straight. Dad! What the heck are you doing?! Your skin is so dry. You need some moisturizer. You're so annoying. Wait a minute. What? On this side too. So annoying! You're such a bummer! Dali! Oh my gosh! Finally! We're done! You'd better get used to it. We can't rely on Dali anymore. Don't worry. Dali will come back. Just watch and see. Girl, can you see Angel? The one in green. Don't be too obvious! It's Angel. - She's with a guy. - Who's the guy? I knew it! They are even holding hands. Give me your phone. My battery is almost empty. What should we do? Hey! May I come in? Yes, Marga. Your sketches look promising. Don't you want to finish them? This isn't me anymore. I've changed for Angel. Well, I've come here to tell you something. I saw Angel. Yes? She was with a guy. That was Freddie, her gay friend. No, this wasn't Freddie. They were holding hands. Marga, if you can't accept my being straight, please spare Angel from all the hate. Huh? Hate? Romy was there too. You can ask him if you want. Marga, I love Angel. I am straight and I like girls. Is that so hard to believe? Yes, I know. I know that you're straight. And yes, it's hard for me to accept that you love Angel because I love you. What? I've been in love with you for so long, Dali. And it pains me to see that you're changing yourself for a girl. A girl who's just fooling you. You're distancing yourself from the people who love you. The people who love you no matter who you are. Marga, I don't get it. I love you. Which part of that don't you understand? I love you. Marga, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Thank you. You're so insensitive. I guess you are straight. Angel? Dali? What's up, Bro? My gay cousin likes you. What? Dali! Diego! That's enough! Dali! - Screw you! - What do you want?! Stop it! Go home! I can handle this. Dali? What happened? Angel, are you fooling me? Huh? Why would I fool you? I thought we were okay, Angel? Are you just using me because I am good at makeup? And I design your gowns? Dali? Tell me the truth, Angel. Dali, you're good and talented. Dali, I can get other makeup artists and other designers. But I chose you because I like you. I entertained you because I like you. You like me but you still flirt with Diego? - Dali, no. - What? Tell me, Angel. If you have two faces, I can put makeup on the other one. Dali! Be honest, Angel. You are being dishonest. How dare you say that to me? You're the one who's not being honest with yourself. You've changed, Dali. The Dali that I know is not violent. I don't even know if I can still trust you. I don't know if I still know you. Because you are the one who's being dishonest to yourself. - Angel, sorry. - No! Angel! Side by side but not together Because we are worlds apart Just dream or find a way So we can understand each other Veronica, I said, turn off the lights. Dali? I tried to reach Even though it was difficult, I was able to do it Because that's the only way To be with you and to hold you But why is this? Even if I give you everything Why am I still not welcome in your world? Gosh, your nails are dirty! Stop it, Dad. Dad. I'm sorry. Sorry. You don't have to apologize. I should be the one to say sorry. Because I didn't listen to you. I love you, Dad. I love you. I love you too. Always remember that. Whoever you may be. Whatever you may be. If you say you're straight... Then I'll accept it. I am straight, Dad. Is that confirmed? Confirmed. Oh, Dali... Dad. Dad. Veronica, use Code 315. It matches Madam's skin tone. Thank you, Sis! Work, work, work! Go, go, go! Perfect! Nope! Her under-eye needs more polish. - Amazing! Very life-changing! - See! I told you. Awesome! Thank you, girl! You're welcome. Give me a twirl. Faster! Thank you. We'll just wait for her to pay. Let's clean up so we can go home. Go! Hello, sissies! Girl. I'm just going out for a smoke, okay? Let's talk when I come back. Okay, okay. Marga. Welcome back! I'm sorry. Come here! I missed you. I missed you too. Sir, do you know where Diego is? I haven't seen him yet. All is good, bro. Bro, I'm sorry about... This? No worries. It wasn't painful. Hi, Diego! Babe. Hi. Bro, I thought you were dating... Angel? No. We met up for closure. We're friends now. Really? Yeah. Let's go? See you around. See you. Thanks. Hi, Angel. It's me, Dali. The real Dali. I know this might be hard for you. Because it was hard for me too. It wasn't easy for me to hide my true self. What I really am. What I really wanted. It was so confusing. People kept telling me how I should act. Oh, too manly! Too stiff! Oh, so gay! So effeminate! It drove me crazy. But you know what? Despite everything... there's one thing I am sure of. Never forget to moisturize and wear sunscreen. Stress is bad for your skin! Angel, I am so sorry. Sorry I was always trying to prove to you that I am straight. Now I know that the only thing I need to prove to you... Is my love for you. I love you, Angel. Can you give me another chance? So what if we're different We don't need to conform to their rules So soft. So smooth. Oh my God!
