T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... We have engine start. ...two, one. We have liftoff. Thirty-two minutes after the hour, and the shuttle has cleared the tower. Guidance systems online. Eleven, Houston, thrusters go. - All engines are doing good. - Yep, steady there, from projections at point six-two. And Houston, here comes the... Cola. Lucy. - Specialist. - Yes, yes. I'm here. Time to wrap it up. We're going home. Just a few more minutes. Just a few more minutes. Copy, Houston. - Go for deorbit burn. - Roger. I have the stick. Beginning entry. What a light show at the aft. - Is it really? - Take your mirror. Do you have a mirror? Yeah, I do. Let me get that. Watch your angle on re-entry. Roger, Houston. Adjusting. We have you coming in a little... Hi. How's, uh... Sorry. - How was school today? - Mm. Wanna get some ice cream? No. Thanks. All right. Well, the azaleas look nice. Well, I watered them every day. Or I would have, if I didn't forget. Those are new. I put 'em in yesterday. I missed you. Yeah? Babe, you went to space. I am so proud of you. It was... I don't know. - It's hard to put into words. - I bet. To be up there... Hey, sleepyhead. How's rocket lag? What time is it? Where's... where's Iris? 8:30. I already put her on the bus. Hey, can you... I missed you. What? Mission accomplished. And you're settling back in? Never settle. My nana taught me that. How are you feeling physically? I'm in top shape, sir. After just a few days in micro-gravity your bone and muscle mass begins to shrink dramatically. You were up ten days. I've seen men carried off the shuttle, too weak to stand. Well... All right. Top of your class, naval academy. Valedictorian, high school and college. Can you stop? Stop what? - Working. - I'm taking a few days. My niece is staying with us. Blue Iris. Blue Iris? It was his second choice, actually. My brother. His wife talked him out of Sanctuary Rose. Annabelle, she was the practical one. Change a light bulb. Remember to eat. She's dead now. Anyway... Iris is staying with us, and we've been doing girl things. Didn't I see you here on the track yesterday, and in the gym this morning? Bone density. Muscle mass. Throw a Frisbee. Fly a kite. What? Nana says Frisbees are for dogs. Tell me about her. Three guys chased my dad home from school one day with axe handles and she put the first warning shot in the dirt. - The first? - Lucy: Well, in San Angelo a leg shot's considered a warning. Why'd they chase him? Your dad. He pissed in their gas tank. You know Michael Collins? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Apollo 11. He flew the command module for Neil and Buzz. Yeah. So you know that after he dropped them... he circled the moon for hours. It's farther from Earth than any man has ever been. No light, no radio. And he wept, consumed by darkness and then, when he saw the sun again... he wept some more. Inside the module he wrote... "I am now truly alone... and absolutely alone from any known life. I am it." I'm fine. There are better ways to kill yourself than smoking with your oxygen machine. How's that, fucker? I'm back. - Ooh. Did you go somewhere? - Well, up, then down. You show those Ivy League assholes - how it's done? - Damn straight. Your father used to play golf. Said it was good for business. He was unemployed. He was an idiot. You here to make sure I'm still breathing? Drew said your disposal's out. Oh. That it is. I'm supposed to be on vacation. I've already color coded three rooms in my house and signed up for neighborhood watch. You should get a hobby, like me. Drinking's not a hobby. Well, the government says I'm too old to do it professionally. Fixed. They givin' you a medal? NASA? For what? All I did was my job. Good girl. No special treatment. Sebastian dropped Iris on us again while I was in space. Can you believe that? Did you leave her in the car? She's in school. He called me from the road, your brother. Something about power tool races in San Francisco. You know what I told him? "Get a job." Oh, he has a job. He writes poetry. When's your next mission? Polaris goes in a few weeks. Orion is in 13 months. That's my shot. Well, you're not getting any younger. So, you're just gonna have to work harder. Suit circuit return valve. Reverse O-two umbilicals. Check. Flush PKG, screen and honeycomb. Check. Watch it. Relax. You'll run faster. Loose, you know? No hurry. Just let it go. Keep up the good work! - Good morning. - Good morning. Mm. I said good morning. - Good morning. - There you go. If you are in this room and you are wearing blue you are a candidate for the next Orion mission. Mission parameters are fluid... but for now... let's plan on a two-week run. We'll be installing a starboard truss system - and a solar array pair. - I saw you on the track today. Mm-hmm. You need to keep your head up. Some of you have taken this ride before. Congratulations. Now, the bad news. If you wanna go again... Thanks for the tip. ...you're gonna have to earn it. And that's no joke. Dismissed. You were on the Destiny mission, right? - I was. Tell me your name again? - I'm Erin Eccles. - I just came over from the SAIL. - Wow. So, do you have any pointers? Other than keep my chin up. Oh, that depends. Are you a pilot? I'm in robotics. Well, scratch two seats right there. So, you want that seat on Orion? You take it. Just make sure to leave one for me. All right? Copy that. Still a lot of Christmas up here. - Copy, Orion. - O-two level's solid. DFS restart indicated, Houston? Orion, we confirm. Hard restart. O-two dropping. Venting fast. - Eccles? - Give me a second. We don't have a second, rookie. Exiting atmosphere. Prepare for final destination. Y'all done burning down the subdivision? We're almost eating here. More? Whoo! - You know, I was thinking. - One more mission. - What? I didn't say anything. - One more mission. Then we should have a baby. That's what you were gonna say, right? All right, who wants a hot dog, and who wants a burger? Form a single line, please. Pupil response normal. Any headaches? No. - Nausea, diarrhea? - Negative. What she's asking is... how was it? Mission accomplished, sir. That's not what I asked. Best two weeks of my life. Boat ran like a clock. Systems held up. Crew were top-class. So, you liked it? Sir... I never felt so alive. Hey, Moonglow. I was just giving my ladies a little tour here. Chelsea, Emily, this is Daddy's friend, Lucy. Lucy was just in space last week. Maybe y'all have some questions for her? Um... Where'd you get that brownie? Over there. And they're very good. Yeah, okay. Here. Go. Don't tell your mother I gave you that. Separated. It's a lot of work. Well, they seem like great kids. They are. Hey, you bowl? - What? - Bowling. Indigenous cultural praxis of the North Americas. Promotes social cohesion through, I don't know... pointless competition, alcohol abuse, and shared footwear, I guess. With you and the girls? No. The club. You're a member now. - What club? - Hey. Are y'all gonna roll tonight? - Yeah. - Uh, no. - Yeah. - For sure not. - You're going. - Won't be there. We're going. She's going. What club? The most elite group of people ever formed in the history of mankind. A secret society where every single member has seen the face of God. The one... the only... Circle of the Rolling Ball. Well, fun as that sounds... I'm not really a joiner. And my husband... Yeah, we've got my niece staying with us, so... Earth families. You got a new family now. Semper volvens. You want me to say that to my husband? That bad Latin? No. Just tell him you're training. That's what the rest of us do. Sugarland Lanes, eight o'clock. Ask for Wernher von Braun. Hey, girls, let's go. Let's see if we can eat those things ridin' a centrifuge. Say bye. - Bye. - Come on. See you tonight. Where's the change? Training? What training? You're not supposed to be back yet. I know. I told them. But... It's really simple stuff. More of a debrief, really. Tell her I'm injured. I won't be home late. Well, if it's good for NASA, - I guess it's a win for me, too. - That's the spirit. - Love you. - You too. - Is that me? - Yes, it's you. - Let's see what you got, girl. - Oh, all right. Show us what you got. There you go. Whoa. - Darn it! - Trajectory apex error. All right. I like a challenge. Make it a little fairer on y'all. All right. Listen. May I? It depends. You got any idea - what you're talking about? - I do. My great-grandfather actually invented this game, so, come on. Look. Here. - Thank you. - Secret is... do, like, a little twist at the end. - 'Cause yours is goin' that way. - Little twist? - Yeah. A little... - He coach you all like this? That the secret of this club? We ask him not to. It gets weird. Yeah. Help us. Can you? The secret is he's hammered. That's not a secret at all. Let's go. I wanna see this. Just follow through. Feel it, all right. Let's go, come on. All right, I'ma watch. Look at this! Hey-o! I mean, not for nothing. - That's what you get. - All student, no teacher. - Really? - Mm-hmm. First of all, that sounds... That's adorable. - That's true. - I know. But, of course, that's all we compare to. So, how you been doing since you've been back? Tongue still feel weird? - Yes. What is that? - No one knows. They think the brain adjusts to speaking in zero G. It'll be gone in about a week. I'm great. Pretty great. I'm just a little bit... I don't know. You know? - Say no more. - We've all been there. - Yeah. - Been where? What did I say? I don't know, but... you said it. That's... Just feel a little off. No, not off. It's more... You know how it is. You go up there, you see... - Everything. - The whole universe. Yeah. And everything here looks... so small. We're so small. And then you splashdown. What? You go to Applebee's? You got Monday Night Football? Clip your toenails? And all you can think about is... When can I go back? As requested... five whiskeys. Uh, there's four of us, professor. How could that possibly have happened? - Must've been a rounding error. - Must've been a rounding error. That's why he likes you so much. You laugh at his old jokes. - And they are old. - Does he have any other? Hold on, hold on, hold on, now. Come on. - Oh. And a gentleman. - Yes, ma'am. Of course. - Ooh! - Take it easy now, easy. Still finding those Earth legs, huh? Or just drunk. You're home. - That's good. - I know. Of course. It's just... Never mind. Thanks. That was... I needed that. See you on deck, sailor. Don't go fallin' off those shoes. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Better already, huh? Well, if you say so. - Is she, uh... - Asleep, I think. How was training? Oh, you know. It wasn't really anything. - Are you drunk? - No. I'm a little. Some of the... Kate and the guys we went out for a beer after. Well, good. Good. You need to blow off some steam. Wow. I'm gonna... You, do you wanna... Yeah, sure. Yeah. I... Let me just... let me just clean up here. Suit circuit return valve. Reverse O-two umbilicals. Check. Flush PKG, screen and honeycomb. Check.

Gotta love a checklist. Maybe they're just lazy. I'm awake. I am awake. Hi. What you doing for lunch? Uh. Wow. Well... I brought a sack lunch. Now, I know it's... late notice but I could see if the maître d' can find us a table for two somewhere. Uh... Sure, sure. All right. All right. You do this every day? Not every day. I do do work. - I'm not sure about that. - You know, right? - I do. - I question. Okay. Your kids seem cool. Thank you. Yeah, they're all right. I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you. But things did get... Things were different after I... came back. Marriage-wise. Tricky. I saw my house from space. Not literally. But... my life. Drunk mother, deadbeat father. Grow up. Join the navy. Marry the nicest guy you can find. Well, he is nice. Oh! What the hell are you doin'? - What? What? - What's wrong with you? What? It's like... it's like we're back in high school smoking under the bleachers. Oh, come on, now. No, you never smoked anything under any bleachers. Says you. Look at you. Straight arrow. You've never done a thing wrong in your life. I've done plenty of things wrong. Mm. Yeah. I bet you never even came in second in anything. Look, Mr. Know-it-all... I've done lots of tawdry shit, I'm here to tell you. - Really? - Yeah. Hit me. Yeah. Okey-dokey. Hey. Nana's here. Here? - Hey. - Oh, hi. This fucker says I can't smoke in the house. That's me. Apparently, you invited your grandmother to dinner. Oh, shit. Yes, I did. I'm so sorry. - Yeah. - You look good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going outside to smoke, like a hobo. Oh. Be a doll, will you? I left 'em in my purse in the hall. Oh. Of course. Somethin' fall on you, or are you coming back? Comin'. - It's... it's dinner. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. - Wanna help set the table? - Sure. - Smells good. - Thank you. Thank you. So, what's the scoop? No scoop. Just school in the summer. - Summer school. - Hey, how was work today? - Oh, you know, same old. - Where's your dad? - Who knows? - I wish I could tell ya that when he was a baby I dropped him on his head a lot, but... fact is, some people are just born lazy. You keep your eye on this one. She'll show you how it's done. - You hear me? - Yes, ma'am. Okay, here goes the hobo. Lord, for family, and health, and wealth, and all good things. For the wonderful food before us, we wanna thank you from the bottom of our hearts. For those who prepared it... and, Lord, as we share it, we ask that you stay with us and be our guest of honor. In Jesus' name. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Hon? Amen. Who wants salad? Nana? No, no. Thank you. Would you? I see city lights. Uh, is that Jakarta? Hong Kong, maybe. I like these little sparks that come flying over. - Descending to 200,000 feet. - Roger. Must be Beijing over the starboard wing. Now, 10,000 feet and dropping. - Full burn. - Gears down. Landing gear down. Five thousand feet. Four, three... Forty-five, 42-65, 22.30, 32-20... - Lucy? - Up here. What... - Don't fall. - Oh, come on. I've been up a lot higher than this. - Did you sleep? - I don't know. Maybe. We forget... this happens. Every day, twice a day. The planet, our planet, goes around the Sun. Can you feel it? We're moving. It's all moving. Giant objects in space, millions of miles apart. And we forget. I mean, how is that possible? We get busy. We forget to look up. When you're up there on the station... the sun rises every 90 minutes. - This happens once an hour. - God. Is that what it is? I don't know. You know why I pray? See, my wife straps herself to a giant bomb... so she can leave the planet and go to a place with no air or water. And I want her to come home. - So, I pray. - I'm home. No, I don't think you are. - Hi. - Eight and a half minutes. It's a new record. If they're west... Cola, suit up. - Hey. - 8:34. Time to beat. - Watch this! - Get it! Thank you. Okay, people. You know the drill. Safety first, then fun, then learning. - Raul, run the play-by-play. - Roger that. Let's mark her under at 14:33. Set the clock. O-two levels? Nominal. Pressure readings are good. All right, Control. We're heading to operating depth. Okay, Cola. Divers are taking you to the ISS. This'll be a panel removal simulation. All 18 bolts loosened, not pulled. Copy that. Beginning inversion. Divers in support position. Heart rate steady. Pulse steady. O-two level's nominal. She's looking good, Control. Seven minutes, 48 seconds to record. Houston, I'm in position. Removing thermal shroud on rotary joint motor controller on the upper face of the P-three truss. Are we puttin' money on this, Control? Control? I got a pressure alarm. Request sys error check. Suit breach. Pressure's dropping. Yep, getting wet in here. Dive scrub. Dive scrub. Get her out of there. - Copy. - Walk away, Lucy. - That's an order. - Negative. I can finish. Okay. Cola. Abort. Come on. - Almost done. - Cola. Cola! Move. Divers, in. Now. Three and Four in. Three. Pressure's gone. I'm under. Here we go. She's refusing to let go. Lord, for family, health, and wealth, and all good things. She's let go. We're on our way. Medical team standing by. "I am now truly alone... and absolutely alone... from any known life. - I am it." - Amen. Get her out! Come on! Get her out! Now! Get the latch off. Come on. Get the latch. Get air in there, diver. Come on! Come on. Get the latch! Come on! Oh, my. Her dad called. Oh. Oh, hey, did your suit fill up with water today? No. Just my helmet. Your helmet? Hon. Can I come in? Some people are sleepers. All they do is dream. He was always like this, your dad. Gettin' lost, forgetting things. Me. Nana would be at work, and he'd be in charge... but I'd be the one putting out the toaster fire and making sure that he was brushin' his teeth. I was nine. He was 15. They can do that, boys. They make the mess. We're the ones who clean it up. It's not fair. Oh, no. It's not. But we can do... something they can't. What? Change. Check out this footage. She held her breath upside down for over two minutes. Heart rate never went above a 100. The whole time. In fact, the longer it went, the calmer she got. And she finished the job. Hi. We have a reservation. Cola, two. Of course. Right this way. Could we start with a bottle of white wine. Something dry? - Sure. - Thank you. Well, this is nice. Hmm? - Is that? - It is. - Well, should we? - No. No. She's... - I'm sure she's fine. Don't. - I'm just gonna... Hi, I'm Drew. - Uh, I'm meeting someone. - Oh, no. I'm Lucy Cola's husband. I work for NASA PR. - Drew Cola. - Oh. Hey. You know, we were wondering if you might join us. Oh. Um... Thank you. I am actually meeting someone. Well, just until they get here. Just a drink, come on. We're family. - Okay. Okay. - Great. - Hi. - It wasn't my idea. - Cheers. - Cheers. Well, your personnel file says you grew up in India. - Oh, you read my personnel file? - Well, that's my job. If I don't know you, I can't promote you. Um. Well, yeah. My mom, she was a diplomat. And so we lived in New Delhi for a few years. And then we lived in London. Then we moved to Germany for high school. Oh! No? Okay. Mm. And you went to MIT. Yeah. I... Is this a job interview? Um. Why don't you guys tell me something about you? How long have you been married? Well, it'll be six years next month. I was in the navy. I got recruited by NASA. And then we met in the cafeteria. Romantic. Yeah. She helped me open a bottle of ketchup. I have weak hands. I had a boyfriend in Boston, but he was competitive. And... I don't lose, so... Didn't work out. Mark! Hey, Mark! Over here. Well, what are the odds? This is crazy. Yeah. Well, we came for dinner and we saw Erin - and she's waiting for somebody. - Yeah. Me, actually. I figured I'd take the kid out, give her some pointers. Don't fly into the sun, that kind of thing. We're not supposed to fraternize. - Well, that's a big word. - Outside of work. Oh, this is just a professional... - Mentoring. - Yeah. You might say. Yeah? You're not gonna tell on me, are you, Drew? No. Won't say a word. Now, why don't you sit? - I'll get another glass for you. - Oh! You know what? Uh, on my way over here, my ex called, and I have to pick up my kids. I'm sorry. I would've called you, but I don't have your number. Oh, yeah. No, sure, you should go do that. Crazy, runnin' into y'all like this. Wow. - We'll make some time up... - Yeah. ...at the ranch, right? Uh... - I'll see you. - Well, good seeing you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I am starving. Should we order? Clip receptacle assembly to transfer hose. Check. - That was odd, huh? - Reverse O-two umbilicals. - Check. - You think those two... Suit circuit return valve. Check. I mean, I hear things, you know? Reverse O-two umbilicals. - About him. - Check. Not that you... Clip receptacle assembly to transfer hose. Check. A bit of a ladies' man is all. I mean, well, look at him. Flush PKG, screen and honeycomb. Check. Plus, he was in space. I was in space. Yeah, but... you're stuck with me. Meanwhile, he's a divorced action figure who likes to go fast. She should be careful. T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six... We have main engine start. Four, three, two, one... and liftoff. - Solid rocket boosters kicking in. - Lift off of the 25th... space shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower. This is the roll program. Challenger going into its roll. That's planned. Good roll program confirmed. Watch it spiral away from pad 39 B. Challenger now heading downrange. The first use of pad 39 B since the old Apollo days and the Skylab missions. We'll throttle down to 65 percent. Three engines are running normally. Three good fuel cells. Three good APUs. APU is the "Auxiliary Power Unit." Proximate 2,257 feet per second. It's always amazing to hear how quickly the shuttle moves. It's already more than four miles downwind as we just heard. Engine throttling up. Three engines are now at 104 percent. Challenger, go at throttle up. Roger, go at throttle up. This shuttle mission will launch... My God... - A minute fifteen seconds... - There's been an explosion. ...velocity 2,900 feet per second. Altitude nine nautical miles downrange distance seven nautical miles. The three engines now at 104 percent. Challenger, go at throttle up. Roger, go at throttle up. This shuttle mission will launch... My God... - A minute fifteen seconds... - There's been an explosion. ...velocity 2900... Go at throttle up. Roger, go... Jesus. What the fuck? I told Drew to go to his mom's without me. I'm working late. Jesus. You scared the shit outta me. What... Well, I'd love to make it up to you. Hey. Not here. We have been slippin'. We need to be more careful. Okay. Sorry. It's fine. It's fine. We can go to my place. So, you're a mentor now. - With Erin. - Well, yeah. You know me. I like to give the kids a head start. Oh, is that what we're doing? Well, I don't know. I wouldn't exactly call you a kid. I got a little jealous. Seeing you and her. Did you now? Well, how do you think I feel? Watchin' you and... Mr. Perma-smile. - Drew Cola, public relations. - Don't do that. - All right. Okay. - Don't. - Okay. Of course not. - He's a better person... - What? Than me? - Than both of us. I'll drink to that. Well, today's the day. No more booze until after the mission. You wanna say goodbye together? You fucking her? You gonna leave your husband? Do you want me to? - Don't. - What? Don't trust it. That feeling. It's not real. - I love you. - I love you, too. Sure. But can you tell me one thing that is different about the world because you and I have a feeling? - Everything's different. - Well, yeah. To you. In your head. Sunrise at a different time? Weather patterns shifted? It's cortisol, oxytocin, dopamine. It's a trick. It's like believing in God. What's happening right now? You went to space... and you saw the vast... celestial everything and it blew your fucking mind. So now nothing makes sense anymore. But good old brain... Well, brain doesn't know that you're having an existential crisis. Brain just knows that when we fuck... it feels good. So, you focus on that. That feeling. Because it seems real. Well, that's cold. All right, old boy. I'll see you on the other side. Hey. Need me to drive you home? No. I wanna feel the feeling. Lucy? Hey. Sorry. I've been trying you for hours. I had a late night putting in training modules. I'm home. Is Iris up? What time do you think it is? She's fast asleep. - Listen. - What? Listen, work got a little harder than I thought, and... it's been a rough couple of weeks, you know. When I called the Center... they said you left early. Nana's in the hospital. What? What? How? She had a stroke. I've been trying to call you for hours. - Wait... Can I see her? - I'll take you in the morning. - Is she okay? - Visiting hours from ten. - I can take you over there. - Just tell me she's okay. Well, she hasn't woken up. If you're here, I can take you in the morning. I don't want you to worry, Nana. Doctors say you're gonna be just fine. You just need to... ...get your lazy ass out of bed. You're not done here. There's still work to do. Don't you quit on me. Fucker. Fucker. Go on in the house, hon. Did you sleep at all? I'm fine. You don't have to say that. You don't have to... I'm not fine. I'm not fine at all. There. That work for you? That make it all better? What? What? The glove compartment in your car was locked. I didn't know why, so I got the key and I unlocked it. How? Wait. - You got the key? - That's not the point. The point is you're driving around with a loaded gun in your car, Lucy. So I need to know why? You're acting so strange. I never know where you'll be. What time you're coming home. - And now with your Nana in the hospital... - You got the key - off my key ring? - A gun in your car, Lucy. - Why would you do that? - For fuck's sake, Lucy! Why is there a fucking gun in your car? I had to put it someplace safe. It's Nana's. I found it in her purse when she came to dinner. And I didn't want her walking around with it. - Well, why didn't you tell me? - Why didn't you ask? What'd you think I was doing? Reverse O-two umbilicals. Check. Clip receptacle assembly to transfer hose. Check. Three essential buses are essential-one-BC, essential-two-CA and essential-three-AB. The three essential buses are essential-one-BC... You know, for Hindus, the moment of death is actually really sacred. Holy ash or sandalwood paste is painted on your forehead. Vedic verses are chanted. ESS-one-BC receives power from three redundant sources. And they even take drops of milk or holy water and put it in your mouth. DC power from fuel cell one through the essential bus source FC one switch on panel R-one. And after you die, they put you in the front hall with your head facing south. They put you on a cot... or on the ground, you know. Kind of back to Mother Earth. They tie a cloth under your chin... and over the top of your head. They tie your thumbs together, and your big toes. I'm really sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. It's okay. - Stop, honey. - Let go of me. - Honey. Stop. - Let go of me! Please, please. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Let's go outside. Let's go outside. Let's just take a minute, okay? Okay. Just need a minute. I know. It's all right. I loved her, too. But she's in a better place. Why would God make something that has to destroy itself in order to fly? What? I'm leaving. I don't know when I'll be back. Or if I'll be back. Uh... I don't know anything anymore. What's up? I don't know. I don't know. Babe? You're upset. It's been a big month. - Now, why don't you come inside? - Don't you get it? There's someone else. I'm someone else. - You coming? - But... Liftoff in ten... ...nine, eight, seven, six, five... You can take the bedroom. I'll just... I can sleep out here... or stay awake out here, or whatever. Are you getting divorced? To create a reliable probability matrix for the future requires number of variables that just aren't very clear right now. - What? - I said I need a drink. You go to bed. So, is this what I get? A dead mom. A shitty dad. Look, I had a drunk mom and a deadbeat dad. And look where I ended up. I meant space. Just go to bed. NM, it's 1-OTC. I'm back to work. Copy. T-minus four minutes. Stand by for readiness check. Roger that, Command. Cooling systems, go, no-go? Go. Fuel cells, go, no-go? Go. Polaris, go, no-go? CDR is go. Polaris is go. We are all green. Copy that. - OTC? - OTC is go. Shit. He's gonna go. And attention, all personnel. - Verify ready to resume count. - He's going. And go for launch. Good luck. Godspeed. - Have a little fun up there. - T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven... - six, five... - Five, four... We have engine start. - ...three, two, one. - ...two, one. - Zero. - We have ignition. And we have liftoff. America will continue the journey. Oh, clear the tower. Clear the tower. Thirty-two minutes after the hour, and the shuttle has cleared the tower. You're clear. Press the ATO very soon. Past the ATO. We have pressed the ATO. Separation in three, two, one. It looks good. It's split. Roger that. The experience of IC is coming down... below 60. Climbing, Houston. Performance nominal. - Performance nominal. - Awesome. That's a killer view. It's 300,000 feet. Come on in. Close the door. Beautiful launch. You must feel good. Yeah. Have a seat. I've been reviewing the mission specs for Orion. I'm so sorry about your grandmother. It's not an issue, sir. I won't miss any training. Dr. Plimpton says you skipped your last three sessions. That's, uh... I'm fine, really. I just... I thought my time would be better spent, you know... Lucy. You had a helmet breach. Your hat filled with water, and you were without oxygen for two minutes. But I finished the job. That's not the... If that happened up there, you'd be dead. Do you understand? And maybe we lose another astronaut trying to save you. That's... Um... Sir. I'm giving everything to this program, to the mission. Believe me. You can't just... I need to get back up there. I mean, I want to go back. To serve you. NASA. My country. I'm pulling you out of the running for Orion. - No. - Excuse me? Sir, please. I was born to do this. It's all I have. I'll make sure you're in the running for Polaris three years out. But for now, I want you to take a little time. Find some distance. Focus on training the new recruits. Work with engineers on system upgrades. Hey. You're a real astronaut, Lucy. A heavyweight. You just let yourself get too emotional. Uh, hey, you've reached Mark Goodwin. I can't come to the phone right now because I am in outer space. If you leave a message after the tone, I will get back to you upon re-entering. Can we go eat? Uh, hey, you've reached Mark Goodwin. I can't come to the phone... Can I at least get some money for the vending machine? This is not a drill, cadet. Grab your stuff. - What are we doing? - Training exercise. I'm the team leader. You're the mission specialist. What does that mean? - In or out? - Is this legal? Get the door. Let me give you a heads-up, all right? One day, you're gonna be working your hardest... going toe-to-toe, contender. Some man is gonna tell you you're too emotional. You're gonna think, "What does that even mean? I have feelings, sure. I know, maybe I'm sad or pissed, but I'm not that, I'm not too emotional. I'm, you know, regular emotional." And you know what he's really saying is, you are a... All right. Hey, space girl. You were unbelievable last night. When I get back, I'm taking you to San Diego. We'll go Saturday. I already booked the flight. - Can we go now? - Huh? Frank, it kills me to say it, but... our girl has been pretty inconsistent recently. Erratic. She's a tough cookie, but... hell, it isn't easy to do what we do. Not everyone can handle the ride. Maybe a break would do her good. - All right. - Whose house is this? Oh. There you go. Fuel up. I'll be back. - Lucy. Hi. - Hey, did you, uh... Is Mark here? Oh, I mean, I hope so. It's his party, right? Hey, listen. Are you okay? I heard about Paxton. Oh, I'm fine. I'm good. All systems go. - Okay. You're not mad at me? - Why would I be mad at you? The list. Oh, you don't know? They picked the Orion crew. I'm going. Um... listen, you know, I just... I really thank you for... when you walked out on me that day. Because, I don't know, you telling me that I need to do it on my own... I have to find Mark. There he is. Hey. Hey! - Whoa! Hi. - Glad to be back? - Yeah. I sure am. - Hey. Um. We should get you a drink, huh? Hey, Kate, watch the thing. Make sure nothing burns here for me, okay? Hey. - Is, uh, Drew here? - Who? - Your husband? - Oh, I left him. Hi! What? Hey, come on. Are you... What? Hey, Lucy. I know about Erin. I read your e-mails when you were in space. I broke into your office. - You broke into my office? - He grounded me. - Yes. I know he did. - Paxton. I heard about it right before I went up. I'm sorry. What am I gonna do? Orion. You have to talk to him. Lucy, I need you to listen to me, okay? Take a deep breath. You're having a panic attack. It's not that big a deal, okay? I... I get them all the time. No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. He just... he grounded me for no fucking reason. - And you gotta talk to him. - I will. All right, Lucy. But for right now, I want you to get some rest, okay? You are spiraling. You need to shut your brain off. God. Go for a run or something. A run? A run? Lucy. Is there anybody that you can talk to? A doctor, maybe? It's too bad we never got that weekend away. Just you and me. Where'd you wanna go again? San Diego? - Lucy. - Listen. I know what you're doing. You and her. But you're gonna lose. You're gonna lose, because I'm a winner. Hey, Iris. Come on. Hey. Can I get a soda, at least? Three essential buses are essential one-BC. ESS-one-BC receives power from three redundant sources. ESS-one-BC receives... To transfer hose. Are you okay? Why did the chicken cross the road? - What? - Not what. What's the wrong question. The right question is how bad did she want it? That chicken. What was she willing to do to get across? Frank, it kills me to say it, but our girl has been pretty inconsistent. But our girl has been pretty inconsistent. Frank. Erratic. Inconsistent. Frank. Inconsistent. - I'm under. - Frank. They picked the Orion crew. I'm going. Not everyone can handle the ride. Frank... You were unbelievable last night. - Frank. - I'm going. Hey, space girl. Maybe a break would do her good. Inconsistent. - San Diego. Erratic. - I'm going. Frank. Maybe a break... Iris, sweetie. I gotta go. - What? - There's a mission. I'm on a mission. It's just a couple of days. You'll be fine. So, you're just gonna leave me here? There's food, I think. You can order in. I'll give you a card. Or Drew, call Drew. He'll come. No. You can't just leave me here. I chose you. I came here with you. She said, "Keep your eye on that one." She said. So I did. I am. And you don't get to just drive away. It could be dangerous. Good. Get dressed. Go. Duct tape. Dish washing gloves. See if they have any surgical tubing. Roger. Get it? Got it. Sustenance, go. - Paper or plastic? - What? The bag. You want paper or plastic? Plastic. No, no, paper. No, no, wait. What's the tensile strength of both bags, approximately? What? You know, fuck it. Double it up. Paper in plastic. What? It's a road trip. Oh. All right. Write this down. Houston to San Diego. You've reached Frank Paxton. Leave a message. Sir. I won't lie. Being up there, the experience... I wasn't ready. I... I was ready for the job. I did the job. But the experience... One thousand four hundred and sixty miles at 70 miles per hour equals 20.9 hours. Assuming 2.5 stops to refuel, maximum nine minutes per stop. Now, synchronize watches. Flight arrival time is 1900 hours tomorrow. Requiring a hard departure time of... 2000 hours tonight. Current time is 18:16. ETA to departure is one hour and 44 minutes from... now. I don't have a watch. Just get in the car. Here's one. In what way is your life like a pregnant teenager? Not now. You can't unfuck a pregnant teenager. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mrs. Know-it-all. Well, I know things. I know things. He's gonna see reason. He's a reasonable person. Paxton. He's gonna see reason. I think all this astronaut dick has made you soft. - Oh, I'm soft? - Mm-hmm. I'm soft? I took eight G's and didn't even blink. How many G's can you take? Oh, that's right, none. Because you're fucking dead. What are you doing? I'm on a rescue mission. Low Earth orbit. Somebody got left behind up there. Who? Me! Sir. I won't lie. Being up there, the experience... I wasn't ready. I mean, I... I was ready for the job. I did the job. But the experience... But I get it now. It's not just a job, sir. I, uh... I thought it was. But then I went, and now I know. It's a purpose. It's my purpose. You know sometimes on the old Apollo missions... the bird would just, you know, get off course. Just a little. And you'd need to bring thrusters online just to get her back on track. You know, give her a little push. That's all I needed, a nudge. You know, just course correction. And you wouldn't do that for me. And now I have to do it for myself. Where is she? Contact. Stage one. Complete. Buckle up. We're running behind. All right. You stay here. Keep the car running. - We could be coming back hot. - "We"? Where is the... You okay? What are you looking for? Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Shit. - For the benefit of all mankind. - What? For the benefit... of all mankind. This is the final boarding call for Flight 433 to Seattle. At this time, all ticketed passengers should be aboard. The final boarding call for Flight 433 to Seattle. It's official. They lost my bag. You got to be kidding me. Yeah. I have to go to the office. - No. - Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what. I will go get - the rental car then. Okay? - Yeah. Yeah. - I'll see you there. - Yeah. Passengers arriving from Denver for immediate loading and unloading of passengers. Flight 391... - Jesus. - We need to talk. - Lucy? - It's not a club. Jesus. You scared the living shit out of me. It's not. Look. You cannot be here. You said it was a club. That I was in the club. And other lies. Look, I didn't... Lucy, you are a grown woman. With a husband, I might add. - So this... this... Don't do this. - Nothing matters. Nothing matters. That's what you said. That's what you said. You said that. We're just atoms. But it does matter. And now I'm left with what? - Hey, hey, hey. - Nothing. Hey. Why don't I... All right, look. Why don't I call you in a couple days and we can just talk, all right? - Listen, look. I'm coming out. - Lucy? Oh. Perfect. Now it's a complete shit show. - What is she doing here? - Well, if I said I could explain... - Hey! - You're making a mistake. He's not Einstein. You're Einstein. But they don't let you. They don't. - And we have to stick together. - What in the fuck is going on? Oh, God. Dang! Shit! Mark? Mark! Mark? Mark? Mark! - Listen to me. - What are you... Listen. We don't have much time. All right. Listen. Sometimes there's wasps. Okay? - Okay. - You think it's a butterfly... but then it's wasps. And I know he told you that you're part of club... - that you're in the club now. - Lucy, calm down. But what did he make you give? Your body. Right? And then, you make a mistake, not even a mistake. You just take a risk that they don't like. - Yeah. - And suddenly, it's what club? And you have nothing. All right, it's a trap. It's a trap. So, I came here to warn you. - We have to do better. - Okay. We have to be better. Or they win. - Okay. - Lucy. Never surrender. Breaking news tonight of the arrest of a NASA astronaut in an alleged assault on what sources say is a second astronaut here at the San Diego airport. It's unclear at this time if the assault was premeditated. What we do know is, that Lucy Cola who flew on the Destiny mission only weeks ago was captured late last night after a tense stand-off with police. I know why the chicken crossed the road. To get to the other side. To explore. Police! Halt! Keep your hands where I can see them. Keep your hands where I can see them. Police! This is what life is. Ten... nine... eight... To fly into the great unknown. ...seven... six... To see everything. ...five... The terror... and the joy. ...four... three... To feel it all. ...two... one. Beginning French with J.S. Moore. Today we're going to review several easy but important phrases to be used in everyday conversation. Let's begin with "hello." - Bonjour. - "Bonjour." - Bonjour. - "Bonjour." "My name is..." Lucy. Lucy. "I am going to the beach." "Excuse me." "I made a mistake." "I'm sorry." Go fuck yourself. How do you say that in French? The Summer Day, by Mary Oliver. Who made the world? Who made the swan, and the black bear? Who made the grasshopper? This grasshopper, I mean. The one who has flung herself out of the grass... the one who is eating sugar out of my hand. Who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down. Who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes. Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face. Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away. I don't know exactly what a prayer is. I do know how to pay attention... how to fall down into the grass... how to kneel down in the grass. How to be idle and blessed... how to stroll through the fields... which is what I have been doing all day. Tell me, what else should I have done? Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon? Tell me... what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?
