Rooms for rent What a long face, my boy! We're going to Vermiraux. You've got a ways to go. Gaston, hurry up. It's three hours away. I don't want to go! We don't have a choice, honey. THE BRAVE JUDGE -Hello. -Hello. I'm Miss Perreau. This is my son, Gaston. Welcome to Vermiraux, Mrs. Perreau. Oh, sorry! Miss Perreau. And you're Gaston? Is that right? Mr. Sandrin, from the welfare office, is also in charge of our students' education. We have good teachers who can prepare your son for a primary diploma. As I wrote, I'll leave Gaston until I find an apartment in Paris. It will just be a few weeks. He'll like Vermiraux so much that he won't want to leave! He looks sickly. The Morvan air will do him good. Take him to put away his things. -Can I go with them? -No. It is our practice not to prolong the separation process. I'll be back to see you at the end of the month. All right? -We'll eat waffles. -I don't like waffles. What are you waiting for? Mom! Don't worry. He'll make friends quickly. Have a seat. As an unwed mother, you are entitled to public assistance, but you must pay the remainder. Can you pay it? -Yes. -Yes or no? It'll be a bit difficult. What kind of work did you find in Paris? Embroidering. In a workshop. I only have to pay for food. My boss is lodging me. I can send the money when I get paid. I'd like to go kiss him goodbye. Very well. It's almost nighttime. The roads aren't safe. You should get home. Goodbye, Miss Perreau. Here. It has holes. -And it smells. -Don't argue. Go out to the yard. -Can I keep my top? -What top? In my suitcase. Go on! Come on! Let me play! See? The new kid jumps like a girl. Hey, you! Got a cigarette? You're a liar. Let's search him. Let me go! Leave him alone! -Asshole Blanchette! -Get out of here! Get out of here! Get lost! -What's your name? -Gaston. Was that your mother? She's pretty. -She found work in Paris. -On the streets? No. Sewing for a boss. What's your name? Léopold, but they call me Blanchette. They think it's funny. I'll call you Léopold. You're a good guy. -Léopold! -Negro! Come on! Come on! Punch him! You're going to the hole! That'll calm you down. Get out of here! "My darling, I still haven't heard from you. What's going on? I couldn't come see you sooner because now my boss is making me pay for my room." Paris, one month later. "I also have to pay for my food. So I don't have much left, not even enough for a train ticket." She doesn't have the money. I knew it. No money, no letters. "I don't want to stay here." Why don't you write it yourself? Can't you write? I make too many mistakes. What next? "They don't teach us. I'm not learning. I'll never be a doctor." -You want to be a doctor? -Yes. "The guards hit us for no reason. If you don't come get me soon, I'll run away." Get up! The Inspector is visiting today. You'd better behave yourselves! Shit yourself again, Minard? -It's not his fault! -Shut up, Perreau! You all have five minutes to get downstairs. Got it? Right hand on left foot. Three, four. One, two, up, four. Let's go! One, two, three, four. One, two, three... Sorry I'm late, but in Morvan, the straight line isn't the fastest. Yes, but the weather's good for our students. How many hours of gym do they have each week? Two, plus hikes in the woods. That's good. Let's start with a tour of the facility, please. One, two, three and four. What about their education? We haven't seen any classrooms. They're being renovated. They needed to be freshened up. -I'll have to see them next time. -Of course. Education is very important. We have to give them the tools to get their lives back on track. That's our priority. -Some are preparing for diplomas. -Good. After my inspection, I'm giving a positive review for your school and your educational rigor. Can we expect the public welfare office to send us new students? I will support your request. Please accept this case of Champagne as an apology for Morvan's roads. Sir, sir! They're liars. We're dying here! What is it, son? We're in nice clothes, but usually we wear rags. We're hungry and cold. They hit us. Come on! Stop being silly. Go back to your friends. Let's go. Come here! Perreau, I told you to come here. Quiet! Quiet! What Perreau did is very serious. Joséphine, I think that's enough. All right? Take him inside. Inside, I said! To us! And to the future students Maroy will send us. That boy is going to cause us problems. We never should've taken him. All the good it's done for us. His mother hasn't even sent the money like she promised. These people never keep their word. Come on, Joséphine! You think they have any money? Families should know we don't only take in children placed here by social welfare. Is she planning to visit him? What will we say if she finds out her son was hit? She must pay before she can complain! Who will believe that boy anyway? Very well. I'm going home. How's your wife? Getting weaker. -Are you sad? -She's my daughter's mother. See you tomorrow. Her fever isn't going down. Her cough is getting drier. That's not good. It happened so fast. We'll continue the treatment and up her morphine. How did Inspector Maroy's visit go? A simple formality. Good. See you tomorrow. Ernest. Thank you. Well? Your mother is not doing well. You'll have to be brave, darling. Come in. Perreau isn't well. Maybe we should send him to the infirmary. -He's faking. -He keeps calling for his mother. You're too sensitive! A few days in the cell will do him good. He's been locked up over a week! Thank you. "It is impossible..." Principles of Writing Maroy is sending us ten new students. -That's excellent news! -Yes. -Madam. Perreau... -What about Perreau? Shit! Shit! Take him to the infirmary right away! No one can know what happened here. INFIRMARY Are you sure no one saw him being brought here? No one, Doctor. Meyer assured me no one saw him. All right. I'll say he had severe pneumonia. Say he died here in the infirmary. I'm sorry, but you're asking too much. Do it for me, Ernest. Don't I have enough with my wife, your sister? Listen. We have no choice. Don't waste time. Write the death certificate! -What is it? -You let Gaston die! Get out! Get out of here! -They killed Gaston! -They're worse than wild animals! Get out of here! I'll call the police. Armand. They'll ask about the circumstances of the boy's death. And you'll tell them what we said. Storeroom Death to Poliveau! We got cookies! The accusations against you are serious. We know the leaders, but I want them to come forward. -I said the leaders! -We all want to go to prison, sir. We'll be treated better. -Who are you? -Blanchette. Don't mock me! Who's this Blanchette? A rebel. But he's intelligent. He even has his diploma. A budding anarchist working the rest of them up. We must get rid of him. The prosecutor will decide that. He will open an investigation into the leaders of the revolt. They should already be in prison or be moved somewhere else. You're moving a bit too fast. They should be judged first. Quiet! I said quiet! -You're back, Louise? -I came to see my son. I'm going back to Paris tomorrow. Is your room free? You owe two months. This is all I can give you now. I have to pay Gaston's school. I'll let you stay the night. Thank you. I can loan you a bike to get to Vermiraux. It'll save you time. That's so kind. Here comes the judge and his clerk. It's about time. Get up! -Hello. -Sir. -Sir. -What happened, Captain? Broken windows, damaged furniture, and assault of one of the guards. Why did you revolt? They let Gaston die in his cell. That's a lie, sir. He died in the infirmary. I saw Meyer take him there, dead, in a wheelbarrow. His top even fell out. Dr. Mercier can testify. And where is he? He had to go to the Rasteau farm. He gave me the death certificate. No mention of a suspicious death. It's hell here, sir! Our lives are worthless! -Then it's a matter of justice. -There's no justice for the damned. Don't listen to him. He was sent here by the prison. He's a hoodlum. He'll end up in Cayenne. What do we do, sir? Take the leaders to the detention center. Hey! The judge said "the leaders". You three, come on! Let's go. I'll assess the damage. I'll have the doctor document the guard's injuries. Be severe with them, sir. Trust that justice will be done. I'm here to see my son. This can't be! Should we call the doctor? -I want to see him. -You can't. The doctor put him in a coffin to avoid contagion. You can open the coffin! Only the police can do that. Then go get them! Don't insist, miss! -I want to see him! -Please. Wait, please! Calm down. Take a seat. Unfortunately, it's no use. The coffin has been taken to the Avallon morgue. I know this is difficult. But I assure you that your son died like the happy little boy he was. Severe pneumonia. What can you do? We'll help you with the formalities at the funeral home. And I'll do what's needed to find a plot in the cemetery for your son. -Hello. -Sir. -Hello, Prosecutor. -Hello, Guidon. What's with those scoundrels? -Here. -Have a seat. What? You want me to prosecute Sandrin and Poliveau? The students I questioned on your orders said they were abused. Some say Perreau died of exhaustion and cold in his cell. How can you trust the word of those poor wretches who have all kinds of problems, if they're not thieves or criminals? Yes, but the accusations are serious. We can't ignore them. What'd the doctor say? That the boy died in the infirmary of pneumonia. Are you going to question Mercier's word? Emile, you were just appointed as a judge. This is one of your first cases, so don't overdo it! Close the investigation and send those boys to court! The revolt has gone on long enough. -Who are you? -I'm Judge Guidon, investigating the Vermiraux revolt. I wanted to offer my condolences. Thank you. What do you know about the circumstances of his death? They told me he died of severe pneumonia. Your son may actually have died from abuse. -What do you mean? -A student says he died in a cell where he was locked up. Why was he in a cell? For complaining about conditions at Vermiraux. -Where are you going? -To Vermiraux, for an explanation. It's no use going there! So I should stay here and do nothing? He was my son! He was my life! I understand your pain and your anger. But let's make sure the truth comes out about your son's death. How? By filing a complaint against Sandrin and Poliveau. Think carefully, miss. This will have serious consequences. You'll have to accept them. -May I go? -Yes. You just made that woman sign a declaration of war. Mr. Henri, Sandrin and Poliveau's lawyer, is a big name on the Paris bar. You're no match for him. What's that? You didn't get it? What? Those scoundrels tear Vermiraux apart and we're being taken to court? Perreau's mother filed a complaint. Otherwise, Prosecutor Gerbaud would never have opened an investigation. I told you he'd bring us trouble. Why'd you let him die in that cell? Armand, please. You can't pin this on me. What do we do? COURTHOUSE Yes? -Hello, madam. -Hello. -Hello, sir. -Have a seat. You have a long criminal record for a boy of 17. That's life, sir. Where'd you get the name De Romchambeau? From my father, a soldier in the French army stationed in Dakar. -Your mother's African? -Yes. She died when I was born. Mathilde, let's start the deposition. Do you claim that Gaston Perreau died in his cell? -Yes. -Dr. Mercier's report states -that he was in the infirmary. -He's lying. -Can you prove it? -I saw Meyer, the guard. -He carried him in a wheelbarrow. -How did he carry him? He was under a tarp. -You couldn't identify him? -I'm sure he was under there. He stopped in front of the infirmary. I picked up Gaston's top in the yard, on the ground. Where's the top now? Put this in evidence. Did you say life at Vermiraux was hell? Why is that? Just look at the meat they give us. It's rotten. Dogs won't even eat it. Do students receive corporal punishment? The guards hit us for no reason. Poliveau is the worst of all. When Gaston ran after the Inspector, she beat him until he bled. -The Inspector said nothing? -He's in cahoots with them. All right. We'll stop there. I'll question your friends in prison -and ask for your release. -We can't go back there. Don't worry. Vermiraux is closed, by administrative order. Most students were transferred to other centers. You'll go to Saint-Lazare until the trial. Gaston's mother wants to meet you. She's waiting on Rue Saint-Lazare. -So I'm free? -Yes. COURTHOUSE Hello. -Hello, madam. You wanted to see me? -Yes. This way. What happened to Gaston? They let him die in his cell. They're dogs, madam. How was he the last time you saw him? He was fine. He called for you all the time. I liked Gaston. He was no coward. He stood up to them to the end. You can be proud of him. I have to go. Goodbye, madam. "After another revolt at Vermiraux, Mr. Sandrin and Mrs. Poliveau are being investigated." What is it, Armand? Oh! I was about to win. You didn't have to put it on your paper's front page. It is my duty to inform my readers. You have greedier aims! This article will double your sales! You're in no place to lecture me on morality. Please, gentlemen. You do our club no honor by behaving this way. Did you really let that boy die in his cell? You're not going to believe such gossip, are you? Tell us, Ernest, how the boy died. His lungs were fragile. I couldn't clear the infection. -Did you send for Henri? -Of course. I dealt with that judge after a worker of mine had an accident. He's tough. You're exposing us, Sandrin. Exposing us. It's disgusting! When was this cell last cleaned? That's not my job. My job is to guard them. Savages don't even live like this. How long was he locked in here? A little over a week. Are you sure? Let's say two. -Did you bring him his food? -Yes. How could you stand seeing him in these conditions? -You didn't warn anyone? -Yes. Mrs. Poliveau. She did nothing? She said it'd put some sense into him. Poor child! Make a sketch of the scene and list all the furniture. You call this furniture? Mr. Meyer, you maintain that Gaston was taken to the infirmary? Yes. -How long was he there? -Just over two days. De Rochambeau claims Gaston died in this cell, and then you took him to the infirmary. He's a liar. -Why would he lie? -Because it's in their blood, lying. And cruelty is in yours. Are you finished, Mathilde? -Why go after us? -I'm looking at the facts. The conditions in the cell where Gaston was locked up were unacceptable. And what about the barbed wire over the cot? It's to keep them from escaping. With all these revolts, it's getting harder to find guards. -So... -Do you have a cook? You think I do the cooking? Please, no. -We found worms in the meat. -That wasn't for the students. And you should ask the cook those questions. I will, yes. And were these clothes not for the students either? Listen. If your accusations are true, do you think they would keep sending students? I remind you that your school was closed by order of the prefect. Naturally, you're... Was this the rod you used to beat Perreau bloody after he tried to warn Inspector Maroy? I won't answer any more questions without my lawyer. "Vermiraux: A haven of peace for young residents." Did you publish this brochure, Mr. Sandrin? No. -That's not what the printer said. -I don't see why I would have. I have no responsibility at the school. According to several witnesses, you spend most of your time there. Mrs. Poliveau is my friend. I merely advise her as a welfare placement officer. You'll have to prove it. Your condescension toward us goes beyond your authority. -Is your deposition finished? -Yes. You may go. Your Honor. Madam. Awful woman! -What are you doing here? -I wanted to see how it's going. If you want to talk to me, make an appointment with my clerk. Will they go to prison? Not so fast. The investigation just started. Are you sure they'll be punished? People are saying they won't because they're important. -If so, I'll kill them! -Don't say such a thing! Trust in justice. I'm sorry, but I have to end this conversation. It could damage the investigation. Goodbye. It's Mother. She didn't have the strength to wait for you. Leave me alone. You didn't deserve this. Poor Sandrin! As if he didn't have enough with the Vermiraux case. It's taking a turn for the worse. The judge is taking more depositions. And he corroborated the charges. Why isn't Henri on the case yet? He's held up in Paris. They should hire another lawyer. This has gone on too long already. Replacing Henri won't be easy. Bitch! You got what you deserved! God punished you! This is an outrage! -At Pierre-qui-Vire... -Shut her up! Shut that mad woman up! -You all took advantage! -Take her away! Bunch of pigs! You got some good photos! Let me go! Who is that? A mad woman. Why'd she attack Mother? Your father's right. She's a mad woman. Miss! -Are you a cop? -No, I'm a journalist. -Same thing. -I just have a few questions. Got any money? I have 20 francs. -If you answer my questions. -Give them to me. My name is Gabriel Latouche, journalist for L'Eclair. -You're not from here. -No, I'm from Paris. What do you want to know? First, your name. Gilberte Kaminski. -Did you know Mrs. Sandrin? -Yes. She ran Pierre-qui-Vire. -A real bitch. -Pierre-qui-Vire? A home for poor girls like me. And why was she a bitch? She forced us to sleep with those pigs at her funeral. What photos were you talking about? He took nude photos. -Who? -Her husband. Mr. Sandrin? Are you sure? -An old pervert. -Take her away! The police weren't able to catch her. At any rate, she's left Avallon. After such a scandal, that was in her best interest. -What's her name? -Kaminski. She was a student at Pierre-qui-Vire. -She's gone completely mad. -Gilberte Kaminski. I remember her. She had a temper. And a nice physique! -You took some good photos, Armand. -Please! Given the current context, we should forget all that. In the meantime, she ruined your wife's funeral. She could come back here and talk again. The police must remain vigilant. Gentlemen, for those of you who don't know, this is Mr. Henri, the defense lawyer for Mrs. Poliveau and my brother-in-law. Gentlemen. My condolences. Thank you. We're happy you're finally here. The Vermiraux case affects my town's reputation. -And our canton's. -Through Sandrin, we're all affected. I know. Avallon is a quiet town. You don't need this. First, let me reassure you. My meeting with Prosecutor Gerbaud was very positive. He thinks Guidon wants to build his reputation by attacking big men. We must hurry, or the national press will get wind of it. I heard a Mr. Latouche, from L'Eclair, came from Paris. If the national press gets involved, it won't make my job easier. Do you think it's possible to avoid a trial? It's still too early to say, but I have reason to hope so. When you spoke to the prosecutor, did he mention Pierre-qui-Vire? The investigation concerns only Vermiraux and Perreau's death. I'm here to defend Sandrin and Poliveau. Ravier, I'll need your services and your newspaper. It's at your disposal, sir. I'm counting on all of you to gather as many defense witnesses as you can. What are you looking for? I've nothing to hide. Then you have nothing to fear. You never had children? -How is that your business? -I'm just trying to understand. -Understand what? -Your lack of empathy. -Toward them. -How can you say such a thing? I dedicated my life to them at this school. Then why are you so harsh with them? It's necessary to get them on the right path. Are deprivation and corporal punishment necessary too? You're here to investigate a case, not lecture me on morality. Does this villa belong to you? Do I have to answer? No. But your silence will tell me even more. Yes, it's mine. Must've cost a lot. I bought it for crumbs a few years ago. -Crumbs you stole from children? -Excuse me, madam! Mathilde! At the trial you'll have to justify your income, assets, and other things. Their monthly budget for food and clothing is around 1,000 francs. There are 60 students. That makes just over 15 francs each. So ten pennies a day. Not even enough for bread! How shameful! How much does welfare pay for each student? Forty-five francs. So they're making 30 francs off the back of each student. Adding what they make by placing some students with farmers, housing students costs them next to nothing. They're destroying lives and stealing from the government, betraying the values of the Republic! What is it? "I, the undersigned, Joséphine Poliveau, manager of Vermiraux, hereby entrust its administrative management to Armand Sandrin." That's the evidence we needed! And that's not all! These are service receipts signed by Sandrin. He's got some nerve. "I'm just Mrs. Poliveau's friend. I just give her advice." These services were occasional and are not proof of employment. Yes, but the contract signed by Mrs. Poliveau and Mr. Sandrin Administrative and financial responsibility does not constitute moral responsibility. The court will decide that. Several witnesses confirm the almost daily presence of Mr. Sandrin at Vermiraux. You're free to consult the charges against your clients. Listen, young man. If it's war you want, it's war you'll get. I don't want war, only justice, through a trial. There will be no trial. You hear me? There will be no trial. -Here, sir. -Thank you. Sir? They didn't miss a beat. "Judge Guidon, defender of child criminals and perverts, is damaging the reputations of J. Poliveau and A. Sandrin." Who are you? Gabriel Latouche, journalist for L'Eclair. I'm covering this investigation, and hopefully, the trial. -You came from Paris for that? -Yes. You should see my colleagues soon. It's being taken seriously in Paris. Even the Assembly's talking about it. It's shameful what you're doing to Mr. Sandrin! I'm just doing my job, madam. I think you're very brave. I'd like to write an article about you. "Brave judge defies leading men of Avallon." I have no desire to stay on the front pages. I want to keep the investigation confidential. Sorry. I understand. Sir, the press is giving you a leading role in this case. L'Eclair is a popular national newspaper. I can bring you the support you'll soon need. No, thank you. Fine. But if you want to reach me, I'm at the Chapeau Rouge Hotel. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Is this true? Did you and Mrs. Poliveau... Did you... abuse the students at Vermiraux, and let a boy die in his cell? Do you believe for a second that I could be capable of such things? This young judge has decided to drag us through the mud. When Mother ran Pierre-qui-Vire... That girl who caused a scandal at the cemetery -is completely mad. -What photos was she talking about? She was talking nonsense. Now... How was your day? Did you visit Mother's grave? Excuse me. -How long has she been staying here? -It must be a month now. Here she is! Hello, miss. Mr. Henri. I'm the defense lawyer for Mr. Sandrin and Mrs. Poliveau, whom you filed a complaint against. Can we talk? -All right. -Let's take a walk. Please accept my condolences for your son. What do you want? I'm afraid you're mistaken about my clients' responsibility for your son's death. You were influenced by the judge. You know, sir, I didn't go to school as long or know as many high society people as you, but I can spot honest people, and the judge is one of them. Speaking of honesty, let's get right to it! You worked for a while in a hotel in Auxerre. Yes. So what? I believe your work did not consist of only changing sheets and emptying ashtrays. What are you getting at? I won't beat around the bush. A police report indicates you were engaged in acts of prostitution. A police report? Yes. And I have witnesses who can corroborate the facts. -What you're doing isn't right. -In this case, you are the main witness. I fear your questionable morals will hurt your cause in court. Drop your complaint and go back to Paris. How can you ask for justice for a son you couldn't raise? Get out of here. Get out of here! -I want to see the judge! -What is it, Miss Perreau? Let her in. Thank you. They want to smear me! -Who? -Their lawyer wants me to drop it. Have a seat. Why? He says they had nothing to do with my son's death. That's not true, and he knows it. Yes, but if I don't... If I don't drop it, he'll... Did he threaten you? He'll say I prostituted myself. Is that true? Yes. Gaston's father left me, and I couldn't pay the nurse. -But I'm not a prostitute! -This won't help your case. Did Henri go to your home to tell you that? He was waiting for me. That's against the law. Were there witnesses? Mrs. Roumier was talking to him. He was trying to unnerve you. Can you imagine? If word gets out in Avallon... I'm dropping my complaint. That won't stop the investigation. I advise you not to do it. A big part of my case is based on your testimony. Think of your son! You're thinking of your brilliant career! They say this is about you. You don't care about Gaston and me. Who said such nonsense? I have more to lose than to gain in this case, especially if you drop it. I need to think. That's the last thing we needed. -Mrs. Roumier? -That's me. Hello. Judge Guidon. Oh, sorry. I didn't picture you so young. What can I do for you? Did a man come to see Miss Perreau this morning? Not that I know of. Yes, a lawyer. Mr. Henri. Think. It's important. She says you were talking. No, I assure you. I didn't talk to anyone. What are you afraid of? I'm sorry, but I have things to do. Excuse me. She was afraid to talk. Or she was paid to keep quiet. Like everyone! Yes, but you have no proof. If Louise drops her complaint, it won't help us. They can't stop me from taking this to trial. Yes? I don't have time. What do you want now? To talk about another case. What other case? The Pierre-qui-Vire Home for Girls. Sandrin's wife ran it. I know. Have a seat. It was closed by administrative order after a resident committed suicide. I met the young woman who interrupted Mrs. Sandrin's funeral. Her revelations might interest you. In that case, like at Vermiraux, the Sandrins abused those they were supposed to protect. They forced the girls there into prostitution. They also took indecent photos. Unfortunately, no complaint was filed in that case. None will be. Many of the town's big names were involved in acts that would harm their reputations. Fine. -What do you want? -You must reopen the case. A girl killed herself, and no one did a thing. -Take it to the prosecutor. -He did nothing when the scandal broke. You must reopen the case. Listen, I'm afraid I'm not able to open a new case. Perreau's mother wants to drop her complaint, and she's my main witness. You have plenty of witnesses. Your case is solid. It'll be even more so when you visit Mr. Vincenot, a farmer in Foissy. Good evening, sir. -Did we scare them? -Who? Don't treat me like a fool. Judge Guidon, investigating the Vermiraux case. This is Miss Jeannot, my clerk. -What's it got to do with me? -Do you know Perreau died? I heard about it. A nice boy. Did he work for you? He helped bring in wood. What do you mean by "helped"? Don't bother. I know Sandrin placed him here. Like he placed Bassporte and Menot, who just ran away. Since my wife died, I've had to run the farm alone. Did he pay you? I don't want any problems with Mr. Sandrin. Don't worry. You won't have any. He's being investigated. He placed Menot and Bassporte here for a month. I give them room and board, and in exchange... They work for you. Yes. Do you pay Sandrin for their services? Every week, I give him chickens, fruit and vegetables and cider, when it's in season. Did you know he already receives a substantial allowance for them? I've heard that. What will happen to me? Nothing, if you testify at the trial. Let's go, Mathilde. Do you confirm before the defendants and their lawyer the statements you made in your depositions, that Mrs. Poliveau beat Gaston Perreau bloody after he tried to tell the Inspector you were being abused? Beat bloody? Are you sure I didn't slit his throat? Madam, you'll speak when I ask you a question. So? As for Mr. Sandrin, all three of you stated he was there that morning at the infirmary. Forgot how to talk? Wistel, you had a lot more to say last time. Let these young men speak freely. Don't try to pressure them. I have all the depositions they gave earlier. You'll have a hard time getting them admitted in court if your witnesses don't confirm them today at this hearing with my clients. Go ahead, Wistel. Don't be afraid to talk! I made a mistake. Mrs. Poliveau didn't hit him. Who did, then? Meyer. And he hit him really hard. De Rochambeau, you said it was Mrs. Poliveau -and not Meyer the guard who hit him. -No. All right. Can you confirm that you saw Meyer carrying Gaston in a wheelbarrow? I'm not sure Gaston was under the tarp. But was Meyer headed to the infirmary with the wheelbarrow? Yes, but he could've gone elsewhere. And Gaston's top? Didn't you find it in the yard after Meyer went by? -He could've lost it before. -Léopold... I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I think it's time to end this charade and not prolong my clients' agony and humiliation. Your other testimony better be more substantiated if you want to build a case. Madam. Can we go too? No. I get you released, and this is how you thank me? -Sorry, but we had no choice. -What does that mean? Can we go? Yes. What did they do to them? Even Léopold retracted his statement! Miss Perreau is dropping her complaint. Witnesses are retracting. There won't be much left of your case. Or at least, not enough to send it to court. You know Henri and his circle corrupted everyone! Surely, but you don't have any proof he bribed witnesses. I'll find it. Miss Perreau's landlady says Henri never came to her house. She'll never keep up the lie in court. Do you know who paid the witnesses to retract their statements? -I'll find out! -I admire your persistence. Let me say something, Emile. I think the charges against Sandrin and Poliveau deserve a harsh penalty, but the court is helpless in these conservative districts. I know that. That's why the Pierre-qui-Vire case was dismissed. -There was no evidence. -It was eliminated! Why let such practices continue? Without Zola, Dreyfus would've been shot. Emile! Even if you share the same name, you're not Zola. Build your case if you want it to go to court. Your clerk told me I'd find you here. I won't drop my complaint. I'll testify at the trial. You don't think I'm just trying to make a name for myself? You should see a mason about giving Gaston a real tombstone, not just a pile of dirt. I can't pay for that. I'll lend you the money. What's going on? Why is my suitcase outside? -I'll find the money to pay you. -Forget about it. -Is it the lawyer? -Don't ask questions. Go elsewhere. You can't do this. Mrs. Roumier, you can't do this! What are you doing here? You can't come to my house! Mrs. Roumier took her room back. I have nowhere to stay. The lawyer's behind it, I know it. -You really have nowhere to go? -Nowhere. There's a shed near her house. It's not very big, but it'll do for now. Thank you. You must never come to my house again, or I'll be removed from the investigation. -I promise. -Let's go. Good evening, miss. Gabriel Latouche, from L'Eclair. I'd like to speak to Mr. Sandrin. My father isn't here. -I'll come back. -Wait! Come in. He should be back soon. -Please. -Thank you. Why do you want to talk to him? I'm covering the Vermiraux case. Your father is one of the main protagonists. I'd like to hear what he has to say. Who was the woman who insulted my mother the day of her funeral? I saw you leave the cemetery when she was kicked out. Don't be afraid to tell me. I don't believe him when he says he had nothing to do with all this. -You really want to know? -Yes. Did your mother manage the Pierre-qui-Vire Home for Girls? Yes, a few years ago. Did you ever go there? My parents wouldn't let me. -And Vermiraux? -Not there either. Do you know why? Maybe because there were things there that wouldn't be nice to see, like the newspapers say. Yes. Gilberte, the young woman who insulted your mother, was a resident at Pierre-qui-Vire. -She's crazy. -No. They made her crazy. Your parents forced the girls to prostitute themselves with men from Avallon. They also took some... unusual photos of them. Wait. Are you sure? You want the truth? Did you take these photographs? -You and Mother disgust me! -Amélie! -You disgust me! -Amélie! She locked herself in her room and won't come out. She may do something stupid. Want me to try to talk to her? She won't let you in. Why did you keep those photos at home? Where are we with Vermiraux? I'm worried about my daughter. I'm not thinking about Vermiraux. I am. I could lose everything. You don't understand. You have no kids. Understand what? What I'm going through with my daughter. What I understand is that, because of her, you're falling apart and dragging me down. Pull yourself together, Armand. Hello, madam. You bastard! What you're doing is wrong! Do you know who you're dealing with? -A liar. -Who does that slut think she is? She slept with all of Avallon! It's her fault her son's dead. Let her go! That's enough! Whore! -Get out of here! -Good riddance! -Are you all right, madam? -I'm fine. Gaston! Is this good? It's a nice one. Who told you I was here? The policeman who almost reported you. He saw you go down the path to the woods. It's your fault. I shouldn't have listened. I have nothing. Excellent article, Ravier! The little judge is done for. The romantic judge! "Judge Guidon is madly in love with Louise Perreau, who started the Vermiraux case. Judge and plaintiff: it's hard to see how he can investigate the case." I'm sending the prosecutor a motion to dismiss for bias. You can relax, Armand. Are you sure another judge can't be appointed? He'd have to start all over, and he'd be less zealous than Guidon. Why were you seen with Louise Perreau? The lumberjack who saw you was certain. You were holding her. She was on the brink of suicide after being insulted and attacked. I was just trying to... comfort her. Henri jumped at the chance to request your removal from the case. I have no choice but to agree. -I get the impression it suits you. -I can't let you say such a thing. I was ready to support you. But you made a rookie mistake, so own up to it! I am, Prosecutor. All I wanted was to get justice -for Perreau and his mother. -You failed! All right, Emile. You have to learn from your mistakes. Take it as a lesson for your next case. What are you doing? Filing the case for the new judge. There's no new judge. -I'll continue the investigation. -Really? -But the prosecutor... -It'll take a few days for the court to rule on my removal. -That gives us time. -For what? To use the press. We have to reopen the Pierre-qui-Vire case. No one's forgotten the woman who ruined Mrs. Sandrin's funeral. I'll take Latouche up on his offer and ask him to publish a new article. Back to where you were! "The leading men of Avallon, led by Mr. Henri, are hindering the investigation that the brave Judge Guidon is leading into the torturers of Vermiraux. What are they afraid of? Of seeing another case come to light that took place at the former Pierre-qui-Vire Abbey?" -This is what I was afraid of! -Keep calm, Gustave! Go on, André. "This home for young girls, managed by Mr. Sandrin and his wife, became a harem for Avallon's most important men to choose their easy prey. The institution was closed after one young woman committed suicide by jumping -from the second floor." -It's Latouche. -He's scum. -And he adds in his article that he contacted former residents at Pierre-qui-Vire who are all willing to testify. Mrs. Poliveau, with all due respect, you must admit that you and Sandrin have gotten us into a fine mess. I think we're all in a fine mess. But allow me to note that I'm the only person here who's not involved in the Pierre-qui-Vire case. -Are you abandoning me? -No. But realize that this case, which involves you and your wife, risks launching a new investigation, just as the judge was removed from the Vermiraux case. I have bad news. Guidon is continuing the investigation. -Are you joking? -No. The prosecutor rejected the dismissal for bias. Why did he change his mind? Guidon was clever. By asking Latouche to revive the Pierre-qui-Vire case, -he put pressure on the prosecutor. -How? Latouche has evidence of your crimes at Pierre-qui-Vire. That puts Prosecutor Gerbaud in the line of fire because he dismissed the case for lack of evidence. His reputation would be questioned if he hindered Guidon's new investigation. Remember, he's the State Prosecutor's representative. Gerbaud's decision could damage your reputation, sir. Thank you for so kindly reminding me, Mrs. Poliveau. But I haven't said my last word. If Latouche publishes more articles, can you imagine what will happen to my firm? My family? My whole life will be ruined, but so will all of yours. You decided to go it alone. What do I look like? Did you hear what Henri said? With the Pierre-qui-Vire case, we won't be off the hook. Joséphine, we've always walked hand-in-hand. I neglected my wife for you. Vermiraux was nothing. We made it one of the biggest homes around. And now you're abandoning me. Are you going to make a scene? I never asked you to neglect your wife. Vermiraux was our success, and we lost it. We have nothing left to share. Attorney Chauveau Dies "Gabriel Latouche, a journalist from Paris, is partly responsible for the tragedy that has left the canton in mourning." Latouche angered everyone with his article. They think he's responsible for Chauveau's death. He was a good man. He handled my parents' estate. You're not going to defend him? The problem with all these "good men", as you call them, is they project an image of integrity, but their souls, Mathilde, are as dark as the depths of the Morvan woods. "The depths of the Morvan woods..." I'll be right back. -What are you doing here, Léopold? -Waiting for you. To talk to you. Come on. I couldn't do it. -Do what? -They paid us to lie. I knew it. He deserves better. They must go to prison. Take a seat. Who paid you? A relative of Poliveau's. He'd come to Vermiraux. Here. I didn't touch any of it. Thank you, Léopold. -Will you say that at the trial? -Yes. Henri will try to unnerve you, to discredit you by painting you as an unreliable criminal. You must be strong. You can count on me. The court finds all the defendants guilty. First, of the assault and battery of several students under 15 years old. Second, of depriving those students of meals and feeding them spoiled and rotten food. Third, of depriving them of health care and letting them rot in a filthy, disgusting stable, which resulted in horrible illnesses. Fourth, of not dressing them in clothing that was warm enough in winter, thereby exposing several of them to illnesses with serious consequences, as was the case for the young Gaston Perreau. In conclusion, the court dismisses any extenuating circumstances for Mrs. Poliveau and Mr. Sandrin, who committed criminal acts out of greed and an unbridled appetite for financial gain. The court therefore sentences Mrs. Poliveau to three years in prison and a 2,000-franc fine, Mr. Sandrin to two years in prison and a 2,000-franc fine, and Marcel Meyer to four months in prison. Court is adjourned. HERE LIES GASTON PERREAU 1899 - 1910 -I can never repay you. -Who's asking you to? Goodbye, Louise. Goodbye, sir. Thank you. Thank you. After this case finally recognized these outcasts' rights, a law created France's first juvenile courts. Loosely based on real events, this film is a work of fiction. Subtitling: Hiventy
