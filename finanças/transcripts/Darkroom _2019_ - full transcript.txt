Bastian... Are you still alive? If I don't hear from you today, I'm coming to Berlin. We're worried about you. Moabit Criminal Court Berlin, 2010 Parties interested in the Lars Schmieg trial may now enter. Please stop taking photos. Good morning. Please be seated. Moabit Correctional Facility Berlin, 2010 My name is Lars Schmieg. I'm always strapped down. The lights burns all night. There's a permanent guard. I've tried to kill myself twice. It's dinnertime, Herr Schmieg. So, how was your day? I can't complain. Are the tomatoes blossoming yet? And how! Also the cucumbers, the zucchini, the pumpkins... My wife demanded a blue veronica bush, - also known as "men's fidelity". - I know them. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Does your wife like gardening too? I'm the one with the green thumb. She prefers to lie in her deck chair and read. - The tomatoes? - Yeah. Beautiful. - So, eat up! - Yeah. I could show you more, but... Shit! Not again! Erwin! Erwin! We need a doctor! Freely edited according to a real event I'd like to check some of the defendant's particulars. Your name is Lars Schmieg. You were born in Saarbrücken. You are a licensed nurse. At the time of your arrest you were in training to become a teacher. You are German and unmarried. I am neat and clean. I am a model human being. I've led a normal life, resolute and honest. - Did you write that for me? - I won't say. And if I plaster your cock and hang it on the wall? I still won't say. And what if I have it for breakfast? Not now, okay? I'm really tired. I have to go home and fall into bed. I'll be so glad when all this work is finally done. It will be the most beautiful flat in Berlin! I'd say it'll take one more month. The wardrobe will go there, the couch over here. That will be our view. Is the jacket new? Yes and no. It's new on me, but second hand. - Cool! I like it. Chic. - Thanks. I feel like watching a film. Why don't you sleep at my place? Listen, I'm meeting someone at home. I knew it. - Have fun. - Don't get dramatic. I said, "Have fun!" - But how you said it! - How's that? Bitchy! - It's just sex. It has nothing to do with us. - You said you're going home to sleep. You know I love you. We'll meet tomorrow after work. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. What is that? A miracle. Come on! Where did you get the drops? Are you a cop? No. Where? - It's wheel rim cleaner. - What cleaner? Rim cleaner from the Internet. Now piss off. Piss off! I'm busy. But don't mix it with alcohol! Wanker... Everybody's taking GBL [pre-stage liquid ecstasy]. It's non-addictive. You just have to hit the right dose. If you don't take it with alcohol, you won't land in the hospital. Otherwise GBL means two hours of nonstop fucking. That's not so easy without it. And it's cheap and easy to get. That's good fun, right? Moabit Criminal Court Berlin, 2010 Herr Schmieg, your victims were poisoned with so-called knockout drops, with GBL. Is it true that you ordered this solvent on the Internet? Yes. That's correct. And you knew that more than 2.5 milliliters can cause death? Yes. You've testified that you measured 1.5 ml with a syringe and used it to prepare small bottles of alcohol. That's correct. How is it that forensic examinations have found more than 20 ml in your victims? And I assume you knew that alcohol increases the effects of this poison? No, I didn't know that. I mixed it with alcohol to mask the bad taste. You admit you wanted to mask the bad taste. How does that fit with your assertion that your victims ingested this solvent intentionally? Can't you see how contradictory your statements are? You're twisting everything around! I didn't want any of that. Here you go. "Madame" gay bar Saarbrücken, 2003 This takes too long! Who put that wannabe queen in charge? If he was at least hot, a sweet boy or... Just look at those dead eyes, like a shark! Hello... Hey! He's ignoring us. What an arrogant fag! He's doing it on purpose. He doesn't want to make money. Look at that gnome face, those dead eyes... I think he's hot. When did your taste get so rotten? - How did you sleep? - Fine, thanks. - It wasn't too narrow? - No, just right. I meant the bed. That too. Do you remember who I am? Sure, the cute guy in the cloakroom. I'm the bartender. Sorry. That was the day before yesterday. And how was I? To tell the truth, quite dreadful. - Charming and honest. - That's me. - I find use a bit too much tongue. - Really? - Oh, God... - How disgusting! Such swinish wickedness in my house! Grandma, I can explain everything. - You live with your grandmother? - No. - Oh yes! - I mean yes, but... But not much longer! Get out! - Calm down! I'm naked, I can't... - OUT! If you're in a band, you just have to go to Berlin. With the band, yeah? There's no way I'll be playing here at the Madame for the next 10 years. No. Berlin is hot. That's where you get rich and famous. That's where you belong. Thanks. I know it's shitty for the two of us, but there are telephones, we can write... - We could send a carrier pigeon. - We could... if you know where to find one. - A little too slow. - How about a carrier eagle? Too expensive. Why don't you come too? - I don't know. Manuel and Bastian... - What about them? - They can't stand me. - Bullshit! It was so from the beginning. They hate me. You're coming with me to Berlin. I'll open it up... The question is how do we get them to fit? No problem. They should fit if we... Or you just break them in half, Roland. - It wasn't on purpose! - Of course not. They're brand new! - They're made that way. - Just stick it back together. I bey you don't manage. - I'll take that bet. - How much? Pull back a bit. I'd say to the left. Well, why not? Did you know that Bastian kept warning me about you? He never trusted you. And now we've been together for six years. - Are you laughing at me? - No. I was just thinking that the first time I saw you, I thought you were the biggest slut in Saarbrücken. Oh my God! And did it turn out to be true? I won't say. Was it true? I won't say. How was it? It was wonderful. - Can you imagine having kids? - Kids? Absolutely. I'd train them to be coolest, most incredible acrobatic soldiers. What's the matter? Not out here in front of people. You work in the Madame, have balled your way through half Saarbrücken, but holding my hand is too gay for you? Is this embarrassing? - That's too embarrassing even for me. - Hey, come back! Ladies and gentlemen, the show is just beginning! - Our house? - Exactly. Our house. - I'll paint a window on the left. - And I'll paint one on the right. - I'll make mine round. - Then mine will be square. - A doorbell? - That's important. - A cloud? - Very good. And paint a eagle. Oh yeah! - I'll make the roof. - Super. Down here, a little path. And we'll put ourselves over here. - I'll paint you. - And of course, I'll paint you. - You get lovely angel's curls. - I'll give you a slightly receding hairline. But very slight! I'll give you a beautiful erect penis. I'll give you one too. - Oh, it turned out a bit droopy. - That's okay. It's just on its way up. - Do I really look so grim? - That's not grim. Lars... Can I sleep at your place tonight? - Of course. I wouldn't leave you alone. - Thanks. Tomorrow I can call the school and say I'm sick. No, you don't have to do that. Of all the trainees I've had to do with over the years, Herr Schmieg was one of the best. He seemed so uncomplicated and down-to-earth. The students really liked him. I had the impression that he felt right at home with us. He said that since his childhood he wanted to be a teacher. Once he'd completed the course, his chances of working with us were very good. During the search of your apartment, documents were discovered which indicate that you stole an ex-friend's diploma, changed his name to yours, and used the forgery to enroll in the Free University. Yes, that's correct. But my professors and students would tell you I'm a very good teacher. That may be, but what this really proves is that you are a very good liar. You never passed the final exam of your nursing course. Isn't that so? Okay, but that's due to one credit that the course instructor refused to give me because she has something against my homosexuality. Nevertheless, I'm an excellent nurse. - Did Helga pull it off? - Yes. Could you put the bed down? I always open the window so that the soul can ascend to heaven. I'll fold the hands together while they're still warm. Would you comb her hair? Her daughter gave me a crucifix. I'll put it here. You're so tender. I don't have the patience after so many dead people. I'll go fill out the papers. I can only say that Lars was a wonderful colleague, a great nurse. He would always take over my shift when my daughter was sick. I'm a single mother. I thought we were real friends. We'd have a beer after work or watch a movie. So I was very disappointed when he cut off contact after he moved to Berlin. He didn't answer messages or pick up the phone. I found it a pity. It made me sad. Beyond that, was there anything remarkable about the time you worked with Herr Schmieg? I must admit that some drugs disappeared during that time. I didn't connect Lars to that. I never saw him steal anything. I can only say that no more drugs disappeared after he left us. Herr Schmieg... In that you stole the wallets of your victims, you took a great risk. Your victims carried little cash, and you managed to draw money with only one bank card. For the others you had no PIN. Furthermore, you received a substantial inheritance from your grandmother. Financial need was not your motive. Is there an explication? I feel bad. Something happened that I don't understand. What a shitty concert! If they could make it, we will explode! First Berlin, then the whole world! Rich and famous! What's wrong? Are you all right? It's that stomach ache again. You're sure it's not just your period? - I'm okay. I just need some sleep. - Go on home. Have a good night. You too. See you later, Lars. Manuel's been a little strange lately. He's been having these stomach cramps. You know him. At the first sign of pain, he thinks he's dying. He'll be okay in no time. Bastian and I were together for about a year. He was my first real lover. After we broke up, we remained very close friends. I liked his next friend Manuel very much. He was a lovely guy. The three of us formed a band. Those two were wonderful together. That's why I was so deeply shocked by how Bastian behaved when it became clear that manual had cancer. How are you? You look terrible. Are they treating you all right? Are they good-looking the doctors, the orderlies? - Come on! - One looks good. Yeah? - What does he look like? Come on... - A bit like you. - He looks like me? - Similar. And? Does he jerk you off? No. I don't have private insurance. Listen, I have one or two gigs lined up... That's why I can't come to visit you for a while. And you know, I have to take care of my mom. - What? - It's not that bad! I just wanted you to know. - You won't come for a while? - That's right. - What? - I can't come for a while. How long? I don't know. You know why I'm lying here? That I'm... Yes. I know. But I... - They don't know if I'll ever come out. - Yeah... My chances are 5%. I can't... No! I just can't take it. I can't visit anymore. - It's too much for me. - It doesn't matter how you feel. - I'm the one lying here, not you. Alone.... - I have to take care of myself! I have to go my own way, or I'll end up a flop. - Man, don't go... - I'm sorry. - You're leaving now? - Yes, I'm leaving. Please don't... - I'm sorry. - But I can't to follow you! No. Stay here. Please... Stay here! - Why don't you write to him? - I've sent 5 SMS's and called him 14 times! Call him again. Bastian, damn it, where are you? I've texted and called so often. You have to come! Manuel needs you! Damn it to hell, you can't let him die alone! He's online, cruising Gay Romeo. Bastian... Anyone who ignores a friend in such distress can be no friend of mine. Sorry. Hello! I have to make a phone call! So, Herr Schmieg, telephone calls in pre-trial custody are not allowed. - I know, but just one... - That also applies to you. I have to explain things to Roland! I'm asking you to quit disturbing the rest of the other inmates. I have to make a phone call! Untie me! - Untie me! I have to make... - Stop your screaming, Herr Schmieg. One call! - I'm begging for just one call! - Herr Schmieg, answer one question. Did you allow your victims a phone call before you murdered them? - I just have to... - Good night. At least turn off the light! I can't sleep! This is torture! Good. Spread it evenly. Do you want to come to my place later? - If you keep doing such sloppy work, no. - I have lasagna from yesterday. But seriously, today is difficult. I have papers to correct. It will take all night. Hurry. I can't hold it long. But be careful. You're supposed to be careful! I can't work with this shitty thing! Kiss my ass! - Do it yourself! - Great! Fantastic... Now I should do it alone. Thanks a lot. Hello, Bastian. That doesn't sound like Roland. If he wants contact, why send you? He didn't send me. He's been talking a lot about you. He misses you. Do you miss me? You were always jealous of our friendship. You couldn't stand me. Don't worry. I still can't stand you. I just want Roland to be happy. Since you've been gone, he hasn't been himself. I really miss him. If you could give him any photos or souvenirs from your time with him, he'd love it. Look... Here we were in Venice. Scova. Roland told me about that trip. - He adored that 4-star hotel. - Oh yeah, it was super. Here we are on the beach. - Is that you? - Yeah. You already had a mustache? Shut up. Hang on a minute... There he is. Take this one. That's great. I like it. Wait a second. Something's wrong. I can't breathe... Lie down. It'll be over soon. Try to relax. Hey, Basty. It's me, Mama. Give me a ring. They found Bastian dead in his apartment. What?! That was his mother on the phone. The police say it was an overdose. Can you believe that? - Does that surprise you? - Drugs! It doesn't surprise me. It seems to me that we're the only gays in Berlin without psychological problems. Look at me. I'm so glad that we have each other. What's certain about my son Bastian is that he didn't take drugs and did not commit suicide. That's what the police believed at first. Bastian and I discussed absolutely everything. About men and sex... Really everything. If he took drugs, I would have known. I told the police that his bank card was used to draw money on the day after he died. The bank statement made that clear. That convinced the police to continue their investigation. That shirt is so chic. Lumberjack style. Plaid is so cool. I like it when boys dress like that. The sleeves ripped off... Do you go to a fitness studio? The only weights I lift are beer bottles. He's a comedian! Let's have a drink. When are you done with your shift? That depends on when I manage to sweep out the last cadaver. You're so funny! - Come on, let's have just one. - No, no. Stop asking! Hello! Who are you? I haven't seen you here before. You're from somewhere else, right? Let's have a drink. I'll buy. No kissing. You don't touch me. You do what I tell you to do. If you understand that, go wait for me. I'll bring the drinks. Two beers. - What's wrong? - I think I had too many beers. - Oh my God! - Sit up. I have to go home. - Look at me! - Oh God! I can't breath! Hey man. Wake up! Hey, move it! We're closed! Shit, I think he croaked. There's nothing worse than the death of one's child. Although our son was a grown man, a son remains a son. You can't change that. The pain is indescribable. And then there's where and how he died. Our son didn't have an easy row to hoe. Being gay isn't always easy. Some years were very rocky for him, and we had little contact. But for the last four or five years, he'd found such peace and contentment, and we saw much more of him. He often traveled to our town. And my wife and I often visited him here in Berlin. What are you drinking? Schnapps. Want some? Oh yeah! But take it easy. It's strong stuff. Leave some for me! It's all I have. - Very good, very good. Thanks. - You're really rabid. But I have something even better. This here. - I know that. - No, you don't know this. Distilled by me. It's only for... - It's not for pussies. - You made it? Yeah. It's my grand mother's recipe. Disinfectant! Can I try it? Of course. We'll drink together. - Arm in arm. - All right. - But I'm not gay! - Me either. That's really rabid stuff! - The devil's brew! - It's very hard stuff. Come on, I'll take you home. It's almost time for the bus. Sit down! Call an ambulance! I feel awful... What are you doing? Help! Help! I woke up in the hospital. The doctor said a few minutes later would have been too late. I was incredibly lucky. I keep in touch with the couple who called 911 and saved me. When I'm in Berlin, I always look them up. When I regained consciousness after the night I thought: "Shit! If I'd have died, I'd have seen nothing of the world." That's why I travel everywhere and write a travel blog. Cambodia is next. I want to have seen the whole world because I know every day could be my last. For that I'm almost grateful to that swine, but just almost. and now the Berlin police are asking for your help. Do you recognize the man from the surveillance video? This could be the man who murdered Tony A. Tony A. was found dead some days ago in a gay club in Berlin-Friedrichshain. Relevant information can be reported to any police station. Good morning. - How long did I sleep? - Not long enough. I could have watched you sleeping all night. We have so much to do before the furniture comes. I think we should take a break today. What good is a new apartment if you wander around like a zombie? Shall I order pizza? You claim you recognized the defendant Lars Schmieg from the blurry video. Believe me, no pictures could be so blurry that I wouldn't recognize him. - God, no! - Shut your damn mouth! - There's money over there! Take it! - I don't want your damn money! Get over there! On your knees! Eyes closed! Hands behind your back! - Open your mouth! - Please don't hurt me! Open your damn mouth! Show me your tongue! Stop! Stop! Stop! Are you nuts? You said you'd tie me up and fuck the hell out of me! No mention of alcohol! - I thought it would turn you on. - Not likely! I've been dry for two years. Sorry. I couldn't know that. You wrote: "Do whatever you want with me." It's okay. You really couldn't have known. We could just go on from where we left off. You bad... clueless... wicked robber. Let me... Please, please... You have to imagine, it was the best sex date I've ever had. And believe me, I’ve had plenty sex dates. Then, when I saw the surveillance video... I realized I could have died that night. That I was just unbelievably lucky that I only swallowed a couple of drops, and that the man... who realized for me such a fantastic experience actually wanted to kill me. My little man, I'll get you out of here. I need you. My grandfather was my hero. I wanted to be just like him. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit: Amen. Herr Director Schmieg was the best director our school ever had. His door was always open. Anyone could go to him with their cares and questions. May his soul rest in peace. Now you're the man in the family. Listen, Lars. You have to make your grandfather proud. You have to study hard. You have to found a family. That would have been his fondest wish. Tired, I lay me down to sleep, now in darkness so still and deep. Father, may Your all-seeing eye keep watch above the place I lie. Let Grandma and those unrelated to me by Your great hand protected be. May all the people, big and small, hear You and obey Your call. Amen. Well done, my boy. Put this on. It was grandpa's. - But it's way too big for me. - No backtalk! Then into bed. It's late. From now on you'll sleep here in grandpa's bed. Can't I sleep in my bed? Lars! I just lost my husband. I haven't slept alone in this bed for 52 years. In the hardest time of my life, you won't let me down, will you? - I have to go to the bathroom. - Hurry up! What's taking so long? You can't sit there forever! If you don't come out now, I'm coming in to get you! Herr Schmieg... How would you describe your relationship with your grandmother before her death? My client chooses not to respond. Tomorrow, all you girls and boys, It'll be time for us to rejoice! After one more sleep we'll awake to say Yahoo! Al least it's Christmas day! Okay, okay, you can stop singing. - Wasn't it any good? - Well, it sounded like a little girl. Now don't be sad. Do you want your present? YES! - Do you love your grandma? - Yes. - Will you always do what she asks? - Yes! Then you will now get a very special present. A Bible! You don't have to be disappointed. It's a very special Bible. It's your grandpa's Bible. It was always on his night table. He read in it every night. The Bible will help you to become a better person, so you won't be like the rest of your no-account relatives. And you will read the Bible every day as well. Will you promise me that? - Than you'll be a good person. - But I wanted a fire truck! Maybe you'll get a fire truck for your birthday, but for now, you have this Bible. Open this door! No monkey business here! - Grandma, look what I brought you. - I don't want cake! Is everything all right with you? If you don't need anything, I'll just shower and change clothes. Oh yes, I do need something. Sit down. You think I'm so dotty that I don't notice anything anymore. You withdrew 10,000 € from my account! - When were you going to tell me? - Calm down. I'm going to pay it back. Why did I believe you're any better than the rest of the family? I even put up with your buggery! You're just as disappointing as your parents! Please calm down. Tomorrow we'll go to the notary public to change my will. I'll leave everything to the Church. You won't get one cent! What you do with your money is totally up to you. How noble your are! I just don't want you to be upset. It's not good for you. I'll go get your medicine. Herr Bader... - You are the life partner of Lars Schmieg. - Yes. And together you moved from Saarbrücken to Berlin. Yes. When his grandmother died, he came to Berlin with me. Were you aware that Herr Schmieg inherited 100,000 € from his grandmother? No. We never talked about money. When we bought our apartment, I knew he had more than he earns with his apprenticeship. But he didn't talk about money, and I didn't ask. At first you had separate apartments but wanted to live together. Correct? Yes. It was very important to Lars that we live together. Roland, I love you. Believe me, I didn't want any of this. This is no place for oaths of love, Herr Schmieg. Put it there in the middle. Stop! Take off your shoes. The carpet is very delicate. Just put it there in the middle. Put it down, but carefully! The carpet... that's not the middle. A bit to the front. To the front! Stop! That's too far. The left side a bit toward me. A little more. Stop! Now the right side. One moment... No, the right side to the front. Okay, thank you. Please unpack it. It's stuck there. It moved a bit. Take the plastic away and go to the right side. A bit toward me, but lift it, please. Beautiful. You may go. Thank you. Okay, you can come in now. Sugar... Lars, what is this? This is our space ship. - Is this the sofa from that shop window? - Exactly. - It's much too expensive! - I stole it. You're full of surprises. I'm happy when you're happy. How would you describe your relationship to Herr Bader? The first time I saw Roland in the Madame, it was clear to me that we were made for one another. That between us there was something different. In what way "different"? It was something serious, something stable. That's unusual among homosexuals. But isn't true that you and Herr Bader have an open relationship? That you both allowed sexual contact with other men? Yes, that's correct. But I didn't really want that. I wanted a conventional monogamous relationship. Roland wanted to have sex with other men. It wasn't easy for me at first, but as time went by, I came to accept it. I haven't measured for a while, but I guess about 7 inches. And yours? I'll come to you. I'll be there in about 40 minutes. I'll take care of the drinks. Herr Schmieg... Look carefully at the photographs. Did you poison this victim in order to rape him? No. I didn't want to kill anyone. I just wanted to have a good time. A good time... Herr Bader... You must have noticed something. Nothing struck you as strange? Did Herr Schmieg's behavior change at all? No. How often must I say this? Lars was just as he always was. I can't explain it. I can't imagine that Lars hurt so many people. That's not the Lars I know. You lived with this man for 6 years. You noticed unusual while he killed three people - and tried to kill two others? - I noticed nothing. At night you lay in bed next to him. Maybe he talked in his sleep, telling the whole story. Did it arouse you to hear it all? No! Didn't it turn you on to hear him talking about it? He didn't mention it! He must have come home and made you feel worthless... - He was the same as ever! - knowing he'd rather fuck corpses than you! - He must have smelled of his victims! - I noticed nothing! - I noticed nothing! - Three dead men! - I don't believe you! - I noticed nothing! - You're lying! - No. - You noticed nothing? - No!! - Nothing? - NO!! Michael, where are you? The taxi is waiting. Michael? Michael! Yes, hello. I need your help. My friend is lying unconscious on the floor. I don't know what to do. He's very cold. Hamburg Street 2, fourth floor. The name is Hartmann. We're on the left. Please hurry! Michael and I were together for 7 years. We loved each other very much. We could live in separate apartments in an open relationship without jealousy. We gave each other elbow room. Even so, we were always there for one another. Now I feel so alone. The circle of our friends is large, and they give me a lot of support. I'm also close to my family and to his, but still... The loneliness is brutal. Isn't that super? With your angel's curls, you're much more photogenic than me. Poppycock! My photogenic qualities are definitely receding. Bader, hello. Yes, Roland Bader. Yes, Bastian was a good friend of mine. He's my friend. He's sitting next to me. Do you want to speak with him? Okay. Yeah, hello? Yes, I'm Lars Schmieg. No, I haven't seen him for years. Oh, yeah, of course! There was a short meeting a few weeks ago. We ran into each other by chance. I don't know exactly. If that's the cell phone data, then it's probably right. Okay, thanks. Good-bye. You met Bastian and didn't tell me? It was just a short meeting. He called me. He wanted me to help him patch things up with you. He wasn't doing so well. So I went to meet him. I said I wanted to stay out of it. The whole thing was a mistake, so I decided not to mention it. - Where are you going? - I need to be alone. Lars! I've made a terrible mess and don't see how to save myself. I haven't hurt anyone. Never forget, I love you very much. Come on, Lars. Answer! Answer... Shit! Hello? Are you Herr Lars Schmieg? Please come with me to the station house. We have questions involving... My name is Anna Bäumer. I'm 52 years old and am a specialist psychiatric medicine. Lars Schmieg is a narcissist tending toward delusions of grandeur coupled with fluctuating self-esteem. He committed these murders solely to assert his need to wield power. Nevertheless, the defendant is not suffering from any pathological disorder. He is fully responsible for his actions. The defendant is a swindler, liar, dissembler and dazzler. In just three weeks he murdered three men and attempted to kill two others. His methods were treacherous and ruthless. Herr Schmieg is cold-blooded and selfish; indeed, narcissistic. The only thing he feels sorry for is himself. During the entire trial I heard no word of compassion or regret. Lars Schmieg is the most dangerous serial killer I've ever confronted. He played with his control over the life and death of his victims. He was motivated by malice and greed. I ask for a sentence of life imprisonment. I also call for the proviso of exceptional severity of guilt. My client has testified that he never intended to kill anyone. He is appalled by these events and regrets them deeply. Herr Schmieg must answer for his deeds and freely accepts that. He knows that he cannot mollify the suffering of the victims' families. Thank you. I grant the defendant, if he so wishes, his closing words. My client declines. With that, the court will adjourn. The court withdraws for deliberation. The sentence will be pronounced on Friday at 12 o'clock noon. I demand the death penalty! Please stand. In the name of the people the court issues the following order: The defendant Lars Schmieg... is guilty of three murders and one attempted murder. He is hereby sentenced to imprisonment for life. The charge of attempted murder of Alberto Molina is dismissed due to lack of evidence. The defendant acted with malicious intent and failed to show any sign of remorse. The court hereby recognizes the exceptional severity of guilt. I don't know how you convinced the doctors, but you're off the suicide watch. I can unstrap you. Don't worry. The drugs are doing me good. Of course I ask myself if I did something wrong. Did I fail to notice some subtle clue? I feel so terribly sorry for the deaths of those men. It's just appalling. I ask myself if I'll ever be capable of forgiving him. But whether I still love him is out of the question. The man I loved, whom I thought I loved for six years... He never existed. And the man who committed those horrible crimes... Thank God, I never met him. In his cell he found this Bible saying: The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
