That boy going to be honking his horn at any minute. Just decided I'm gonna do the same thing with the eyes. Well, Fi, niggas gonna be niggas, some good and some bad. They say a mother's knows best, but sometimes that motherly advice can lead a young woman down a whole road of pain. Now see, he was a good guy. He bought you gifts, got your name tattooed on his neck. Shit, he even tried to propose to you, and you was only 17. He was a bug. And Marvin, the football player that moved his mama off the block and became pro? Damn, Fi, you should have kept that man. He was abusive. What about Cary? Cary?

Sister Bradley, it's a pleasure seeing your face gleaming in the sunshine God has given us. Our annual singles event is this Saturday at the church. We'll be discussing ways of placing God first in our relationships. It'd be nice to have you in attendance. I'm sorry. But Saturdays is endless chicken wings and karaoke night at Venus. Me and my homegirls plan on getting lit with them $3 shots of tequila. I don't have time for church, Pastor. That thot activity will leave you in a state of loneliness and misery. So check yourself before you wreck yourself. Mech. Yeah, boss. God dammit, Mech, how many times I gotta tell you you can't say bitch on the radio? You piece of shit. Look, look, I'm sorry, boss. But look, it's commonly used in media nowadays, like ass and titties, right? It is, boss. It is. If the FCC shut us down, it's going to be your ass and a tough titty. For you trying to work in the broadcasting industry anyway, you piece of shit. And the music selection is R&B in the morning, hip hop at night, not that la di da di, every hour on the hour. You heard what I said. One thing about my fiancee, she ain't never hold no punches. Babe, just give me one second to explain, please. You left condoms and a hotel key in your pocket, you son of a bitch. I ain't even use them condoms. How you gonna trip on some condoms I didn't even use? That's even worse. Really? Hey man. How in the fuck-- But you can't change the locks on the doors and keep me away from my kids, Bianca. Don't do this shit in front of the kids. You got receipts from Edible Arrangements, chocolate covered strawberries, flowers, and shit. You freaky, motherfucker. I don't give a fuck about this-- Hey, Bianca-- --this game. Don't throw my PS2 out the window. Ah! Ah! God damn it! Fuck you and that old ass game. You cheating on my sister, bitch ass nigga? What's up? I ain't scared of you bitches. I ain't scared of none of you bitches. We'll fuck your ass up. Come on. Don't let him do you like that. Bob and weave, man. Bob and weave. Bitch, why should I be complaining? My account's straight, my bills paid. I ain't got no room to be dry end or stressed. You can miss me with that one. He is when he with me, so what else matters? And it's always the bitch with no nigger giving all the advice. For your information, me and Mech working on something. Ain't nobody studying Bianca. She been wearing that same engagement ring for four years, Whatever. Yeah. All right, all right, Wendy Williams, with all the relationship advice. All right. Bye, hater. That's no excuse. But I know you deserve the truth. And all that you ever need, the things you need, I can no longer give. Hey, daddy. Hey. What happened to your face? Can't talk about it right now, I'm just going hear about it. Oh my baby, pookie boo, who you been fighting? Look, have a seat, Khalees. I'm just not ready. What's really going on? What's really going on? There's a whole lot of shit going on right now. It's my job. On the radio? Yeah, on the radio. And Bianca man, she-- Bianca done found out about me fucking around, and Dean has my kids, and-- and everything fucked up right now, man. So that's what you call it? Fucking around? No. Look, Khalees look, Khalees-- Khalees, that ain't what I meant. Come here. Come here Let me talk-- Khalees, Look, look, that's not what I meant. Look, we just got to put everything on pause for a minute. That don't take nothing away from what we got. I mean, you a cool ass chick, you make a nigga feel alive. Khalees knew she had me at go. But that's what good pussy do to you. It sometimes make you forget about what you got at home. Just looking at those roses wrapped in $100 bills, she knew she had me. It's OK. With our communication, there's no understanding. Plus, I'm a big girl. I knew what I was getting myself into when we first started. Plus, you're a good nigga, all concerned with taking care of your family and shit. And I respect that. But you know, Mech, I'll lean back. Don't leave me high and dry. Make out with me one more time. Can we do that? Please? Yeah. Khaleesi, know it's a thing related. All of that potential, when it came down to getting on stage, she would freeze up. Her demons-- her demons brought about the anxiety. And sometimes she would take too many trips down memory lane. And for some people going down memory lane, it's like falling down a dark hole. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My nut on over time. Is my daddy really going to bring my Christmas present this time? Yes, baby. Your daddy going to give you the best Christmas ever. Ha. Shut the fuck up. Hey! Hey, fuck you, man. Fuck you. Because you not living in the park. I'm living in the park. Like-- Whoa. Merry Christmas, baby-- And nothing. --you sure do treat me right. What's wrong?

I know any time you start a sentence off saying cousin, you're about to ask me something. Janine. Janine the dick fiend. Janine. Janine. Name Janine the dick fiend. Janine. It's Janine. Janine the dick fiend. Always a hoe. Fuck y'all. Young blood, what's going on with it? Everything all right? I don't normally catch you in here this early. Man, bitches ain't shit. The usual? Yeah. Very well. I hope this helps you in the right way, not the wrong way. I hope so, man. Hey, handsome. What's up? You look stressed. I'm Cherry. Cherry, huh? That's right. That wonderfully delicious fruit that always goes on top. So you're a writer, huh? That I am. You know today's Wednesday, and our WCW special still in play until 2:00. That's half off all private sessions in our champagne room. Hey, can I get another one? All you got to do is choose a girl and take a key. So, um-- Cherry. Yeah, Cherry. Um, so I can pick any girl in here, huh? That's right. And there's five more just like me you can choose from. Oh. Shit. Don't get me wrong, I mean, you fine as hell, but uh, what's with that brown chick over there? Oh. Alicia? Yeah, Alicia. What's with her? No shade, playa. I'll go get miss Alicia. What's up? Pop it back. Roll that body like Shakira do. Yeah pop that body, roll that body like Shakira do. What's up, everybody? It's your girl Frankie Finch, and I'm chilling with my main man, Rob Jones. Mama? Girl, where's your baby at? She good. Michelle got her. All I need is half the move-in fee. Ty said he was going to handle the rest. And how do you expect to finance this mystery home of yours, DJ? Daddy said he was going to take care of all that. Girl, ain't nobody seen your daddy in two motherfucking years. Fuck is you talking about? Plus I heard they looking for him for child support for some other woman's baby we ain't never even heard of. That's what we heard. Exactly. Everybody did. I gave you condoms to prevent you from getting popped off. And look at the outcome. I also told you to take the shot from the doctor. You know those shots make me gain weight. And so do pregnancy, dumb ass DJ. What is your rabbit ass mind makes you think I'm going to give you another $100 on top of the cash I already gave you yesterday? Ma, I said I'm gonna pay you the money back by tomorrow. How the fuck you going to pay me back and you ain't got no job? You won't be saying that shouldn't when you be buying Mike Jordans and video games and shit. Look, we're not going to bring Michael into this, OK? Because it's a whole other different thing when it comes to Michael, OK? Michael was an honor roll student. He gets straight A's. He's on the basketball team. And he ain't a problem child. And his father pays child support. So Michael was entitled to every damn thing God get him. You sound stupid as hell. Now look at you. You done slid your ass down the razor blade or two of alcohol river. You're on your own with this one, sweetie. Do you get that? What the fuck have your father done for me? What have the son of a bitch ever even gave me? Nothing but a fucking headache, and the mistake of a child that's nothing but a problem, just like his ass. So that's how you feel about me? Yes I do. Pick your head up. Because you need to hear this, sweetie. Everything I put out, I expect a return. You see these clients in here? They pay for my time. This is my business, sweetie. Let's get that clear. I don't have a luxury like you, to lay on my back and get knocked up, and live rent for fucking free. Fuck out of here. All I asked you to do was use your link card to make sure you keep food in the refrigerator. And you can't even do that. And that's because sticky man eat everything I put up in there. Whatever. Hey, baby. Hey. Got some money, baby? Yeah. Got a few dollars? Of course. Look in my purse. Wow. Really? Yeah. Really though? I'm filling out applications. Nobody's calling me back. How the hell do you expect to get a call back and you smoke weed all damn day. But I'm going to help you out with the bills and everything. How The hell you going to help me out with some bills? Me and DJ about to have a baby. DJ gonna what? Really, though? So you going to look out for him, but you can't even look out for your own daughter? The nerve of this heifer. I've been looking out for your black ass since the day I put you on this Earth. So I'm confused as to what you're talking about. Who baby says through school hours when you need it? Me. Who puts clothes on Angel's back when she need it? Me. Sure ain't Tosh, Because they neither one of y'all dummies got a pot to piss in and a window to throw it back out of. My baby. I thought you would be happy to have a grandchild. Um, Tosh, I thought you was dumb, but I just realized how fucking stupid you are. I'm 36 years old. Why in the fuck would I want to be a grandma, damn fool? Have you lost your mind? How the hell y'all going to take care of a baby? For one, you don't even clean up after yourself and wipe your own ass. You ain't got a pot to piss in. You steady coming to me, asking me for fucking money. So how in the hell are you and DJ going to take care of a baby? She dumb her goddamn self. Do you actually think I'm going to be happy with a son who done impregnated another dummy? Neither one of y'all was educated. Don't neither one of y'all have a high school diploma. So how in the fuck y'all going to take care of a baby? See, sweetie, let me put you on game. Me and Melvin has this little thing called a relationship, something you might not know nothing about. If you don't like the way I manage my love life, you know exactly what you can do. Exactly. Have a good day. Whatever, then. Exactly. Get the fuck away from me. So tight. So tight. DJ Killa got beats. So tight. So tight. So tight. So tight. Young female gotta grind hard on my own with no help. I'm a loner in this cold world, so this girl do full self. My pops in the pen, doing life. My grandparents gonna hold me down. My daddy murdered my mama on Christmas. I live with no soul now. I seen it all in my own now, so I never trust a nigga now. On everything I love joke on life I could take a nigger down. I'm so hurt. I'm so lost. I'm fucked up. My man gone. Rep to the big homie cocky. I know I gotta stay strong. This city living just ain't right, when the city done me wrong. A hoe don't even cry no more, but a bitch never gets turned out. I gotta get my face up. Sometime want to throw the towel in, walk around with this hella pain, like I don't need a motherfucking friend. No, I don't need a motherfucking man. I don't need a motherfucking hand. Blueprint, yes in the plans, strong shit yeah, in the stance. Real talk, because when the day ends, I never really understand why I gotta wake up and live life every day in this bogus land. Why the sad face? We should be celebrating. Ain't no female emcee in the city spitting harder than you right now. And that track right there proves it. Record labels would be deaf and dumb not to sign you. Is it really that good? Yeah. Even your cuz thought so. It was heartfelt. It was like the walls in the booth started shaking and some shit. Look, I know a joint we can go to not too far to toast to these multi-million dollar moves you're about to make. Everything on me. I could use a drink. You know it's not a party unless Mary is invited. Girl, I do not blow. Come on. Just for the occasion? Please? Just one toke. No. It enhances your appetite, make you want to eat. You could use some meat on your bones. Girl, give it here. Which end I light this on? The loose one. Being a Black female in the streets of Chicago, life wasn't ever easy for me, not even as a kid. Witnessing my mom be killed right in front of me by my dad, I mean, it really did something for me. You know I always said desperation breeds some of the biggest mistakes in life. And childhood trauma transforms into bad adult behavior. My daddy going to kill me. He gonna kill you? You dead already. We already dead. For God gave them up to foul attractions. And tonight, I'm going to skin your ass. No, Les. Don't you hit me again. Beat the dough out of you. How the hell you going to talk about nature when you fucked me when I was 11? I didn't. I-- I didn't. Yes, Grandma. You sickening piece of shit. Lester, we don't have relationships with our grandchildren. That's just downright perverted. I di-- That's an abomination. And you lucky I don't tell Mech about this shit. He would have killed your ass, Granddaddy. He would have shot your ass down. And you can go to the church, and hide behind a Bible, and judge how the fuck you want, but it's only one person who should be begging for God's mercy. She-- Lester, we don't have relations with our grandchildren. That's an abomination. As I said, bad adult behavior is often linked to childhood trauma. And it's the perfect example of that. And just like that, a young life is over. So when you look at the drama in my city, as it pertained to young black man, you look at the home front. Sometimes lack of love turns into an evil person. What's this? I don't mean to bother you, but my car just broke down in front of your house. And I can't even call AAA because my phone is dead. I'm so lost over here. You mind if I charge my phone for five minutes, or maybe even use yours to call for help? Please? Uh-- Please? I'll even pay you. No. No, sweetie, you don't have to pay me. Come on in. Oh, God bless you. Come follow me. Where did you come from? Girl, I thought I was going to have to hitchhike. Why don't you hand me your phone? I'll charge it. Sure. Thank you. Listen for the sounder, J Cole sounder, in 11:00AM, 4:00PM, and 7:00PM hours. Listen, I just gave you the time, OK? 11:00AM, 4:00PM, 7:00PM hours, that's when you need to be tuning in. I had made up my mind that I was going to take my black ass home. You have a beautiful family. Are they twins? Yes, identical, double the trouble. But they're so cute. And the guy, is that your-- It's my children's father. Must be nice. It's fair. I'm sorry. I gotta wait for my phone to come on so I can get the contact from my phone. OK. No problem. Relax. You know, it ain't every day that people are willing to help strangers. Yeah well, this could very well be me one day, stranded, lost. You're so right. No, they said it's a severe thunderstorm warning tonight. You think a truck might-- I don't know if a truck will be able to come out this way. So right. Hello? I'm at 10611 South Longwood Drive. My car won't start. Khalees Stewart. Liberty Jeep. B62-- L-O-V-E Thank you very much. How did you know my address? That was right on the door, right? It's correct, right? So, what are you doing over here? Were you visiting a friend? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He left me. He who? He left me and I'm pregnant. Two whole years I stuck by this man. And all he can do is throw me out like I'm some piece of dirty laundry or some shit. I just don't understand. Look, look, sweetie, we've all been down heartbreak road before. You'll be OK. It's the future of the baby you need to worry about now. Allow that to be your motivation as you pull forward through this. You'll get through it. You'll be OK. We've all been through some shit. You're so right. You're OK. You know what? I can't let no man kill me. That's right, baby girl. Hey look, and kill what's ever allowing that man to mistreat you in the first place. You can't let him win. It's about you. It's about your baby. Let me go get you some Kleenex. Thank you, Bianca. Troy, you really should feel lucky, because I don't usually let niggas in my crib like that, so consider yourself a VIP. Ah, shit, I ain't getting no chicken overall pipe, this baby mine, so consider yourself VIP. Ooh, yep. That's that daddy dick, too. But you don't want to give it to Li-Li no more. Man, shit's been hectic at the crib, you know. Oh, god. I got to be there for my daughter, though. OK, Troy, and I got a daughter, too. But I respond to your calls and your texts. Come on Alicia don't start that bullshit. Don't worry about it. I ain't short on no nigga because I work at the gentleman's club and you're going to have to remember that. Yeah, you should be proud of yourself. Oh, I am. I'm proud that I can pay my own bills and hold my own weight, Unlike Rhonda squeezing your tired ass dry from your little factory job. You know what? That's all right. I give you your ,, bitch. Yo, Troy, get the fuck out. Alicia, come on, man. I was just bullshitting with you. Alicia. Little mama, come on out so I can hug at you for a minute. Alicia, come on, man. [PILLS SPILL AND ECHO DRAMATICALLY] What's that? Alicia, what is that? What? Alicia! It's my meds, Troy. Meds for what, though? Meds for what? Meds for what? It's STD medication. Troy. Man-- man, we've been laying down together, doing all this shit, and you couldn't tell me? Sorry. I didn't know what to say. I'm in a whole fucking relationship. Fuck your relationship. You got me fucked up. You got me fucked up. No. Fuck that. You know, I can only hope to be as beautiful as a person like you. He handsome, what's keeping you all up so late? Uh, Alicia Jackson residence? Huh? What? What'd you say? Alicia Jackson, says on this ID that she lives here. Oh, are you talking about Li-Li? Yeah. She up here now. What's happening? How do you know my name? And there ain't no address on my door. You want to tell me why you in my house? Bianca, you told me-- B I didn't tell you shit. We're practically family. Um, well, you mind if I give this to her? You the boyfriend, or husband, or-- Oh, man, no. I'm her brother, man. Nah, come on in. Yeah, it's all good. She up in the bathroom, all right? Let's just say I'm the woman that's doing everything you won't do. See, you done had these babies, and you done got a little comfortable. Bitch, you don't know shit about my babies. Mason, grab mommy's phone and dial 911. I'm in love with their father, and I ain't going to let no bitch-- My baby. Oh. I see you in my house-- What the fuck? Mommy shot her. DJ, please eat something. You got to get out of this bed, baby. DJ was left to be the single parent of two children. My heart practically fell out of my ass. Sometimes we got to put it all on a scale. If it don't weigh out fellas, then don't fuck with it. Not only did Khalees die, but the unborn child inside of her didn't make it, either. Ma, I miss my daddy. I miss him too, baby. Troy was arrested and found the next day red handed with the firearm that he killed Alicia with. Bloody situation, he'll probably do life. You're under arrest for homicide of Alicia Jackson. Oh, you slept good last night, didn't you Levine? Did you get a good night's sleep last night? Bet you didn't hear those dogs. You don't hear the dogs anymore. You used to hear them all the time. I wonder what happened to those dogs. Somebody may have poisoned them. I didn't hear you say anything. I was talking to you in there. I was telling you about what a nice day it was. Good morning, short stack. The dog's not barking at all. I noticed that. It was just as quiet and peaceful last night. Oh that was wonderful. I don't know what stopped him from barking. But the little rabbit over there, was so nice to see the rabbit over there. I looked out the door-- I don't eat everybody's cooking. You just never know how crazy people are sometimes. They do all kinds of things. I told you about the little bunny rabbit, right? But you know-- you know, we don't have relations with our grandchildren. So are we still going to go to that barbecue that the people-- --you know, I don't know that lady, but she's-- --riding the subway. I was thinking the other day about when I used to go fishing with my grandpa. Oh, boy. We'd catch bluegills. We come back and scale those fish, we'd eat on those fish all day. I like mine with hot sauce on them. You know she used to get the smaller-- we'd come home from fishing, and scale those fish, and eat them all day. I like hot sauce on mine. You like hot sauce? You want Lucky Charms today? Did you want Lucky Charms? You never told me if you wanted Lucky Charms. Raspberry red. We don't hear those dogs anymore. Ain't that something? Well, I like it. You can open the window and get you some rest at night. I got some good sleep last night. DJ Smile. Give it up for my man, Mech Levine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, how all you doing? Lady, I would like to tell you that was an awesome and most spectacular performance. Yes. Yes. Hands down, best performance I ever saw in my life. Absolutely. You are the absolute type of artist-- the best artist that we've been looking for in our label. And we'd like to sign you immediately. Lady's life had soon become a success story. She won first place at the convention, getting her signed to a record deal with a hefty advancement. That right there puts a smile on my face. Y'all better know it. So tight. So tight. So tight. So tight. So tight. So tight. So tight. Young female gotta grind hard on my own with no help. I'm a loner in this cold world. So this girl do for herself. My pops in the pen doing life. My grandparents don't hold me down. My daddy murdered my mama on Christmas. I live with no soul, now. I seen it all on my own life. So I never trust no nigga now. On everything I love, joke on life. I could take a nigger down. I'm so hurt. I'm so lost. I'm fucked up. My man gone. Reps to the big homie cocky. I know I gotta stay strong. This city living just ain't right when the city done me wrong. A hoe don't even cry no more, but a bitch never gets turned out. I gotta give my up. Sometime want to throw the towel in. Walk around with this hella pain like I don't need a motherfucking friend. I don't need a motherfucking man. I don't need a motherfucking hand. Blueprint, yes and the plan, strong shit gas in the stance. Real talk, when the day ends, I never really understand why I gotta wake up and live life every day in this bogus land. Check. So tour. Yeah. I got a wife at the crib that love to cook and clean, take care of the kids, give me everything I need. But on the other hand, I got this young fly thing, that'll throw it back for daddy, and I never say please. The yin and the yang. The gift and the curse. Four arms, but there's only room for one purse. How could I, or how should I, choose between two Queens? Why would I? Talk to them, bro. I'm in a sticky situation. And I don't know what to do. See I like spending time with her. On the other hand, I love being with my boo. Yeah. But I can only have one of them. So stressed out I'm on a treadmill at the gym. Didn't want to go this route. Now I really need to figure it out. Because I'm-- I'm going crazy, torn in between two ladies. Every time I try to pick one and make a stand, find myself with the other woman again. And I'm going crazy, torn in between two ladies. My god, I'm so confused, don't know which one to choose. Which one to choose. Need to think fast, running out of time.
