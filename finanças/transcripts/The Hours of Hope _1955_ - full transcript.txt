THE HOURS OF HOPE What are you doing here? Civilians on military premises? Sergeant, there is a queue to see the doctor. The boy's got toothache. I used to work with Eyeties for the Jerry, Bolligs; so now, when our army came and the kid has toothache, who is to take him to a Polish doctor? Stop telling me fairy tales! The captain gave his permission. Don't yell, this is a hospital. He gave permission! Come! These are my friends from the camp and I am an interpreter. Have you seen the boss… the captain? One moment, Miss Marysia. Any chance for a little bit of spirit? For example, how much? - That much. Well then, that much. - What happened? The theatre director sneezed while shaving and... You have already taken your share for the next quarter. - Would you like some iodine? - I would, but it's bloody bitter. That sergeant is a right non-com. I had one like that for my boss in 1939. When the Germans started shooting, you couldn’t get him out from under the bed. Tomala? Our administrator? Not a bad guy. Stupid, that’s true, but all right. What are you doing here? Get out, now! Bunch of civilians. It's not enough that this scum is lying about here… What's going on? Don't you know there're sick people lying here? - Captain! They’re Germans! - So, what of it? We have no people and not only do I have to place sentries, but guard those here as well! - They are prisoners of war. - I would... Tomala! You’re in the People's Army. Sawbones! He teaches me how to keep order, a pre-war soldier! Well, sergeant, why don't you join the division, go to the front? With my qualifications? I’m a staff officer. They’ve ordered me to post sentries! Follow me. Staff officer! - Merci bien, merci. - You’re welcome. That’s the second one today. There was also one Serb, three Russians and a guy from Pinczow. What about that Italian? Avitaminosis. The effect of German swedes. You need to go home. Go home! The sun, Italy! Oranges, lemons. Sole mio! Si… He doesn’t understand anything. You're sending him home too soon, Nurse. The war is not over yet. What are you saying? These few days don't count anymore. Hitler kaputt! Si, si! Hitler kaputt! And the actor? Has he regained consciousness? No. The artery is bleeding again. We have to decide on something. The plane that landed at the medical corps must be for him. Give him those brown vitamins. I’m furious. End of the war, everyone is happy and this… - You’re imagining it, Nurse. - I don't think so. Anna was here, Anna is gone. She preferred someone else? Big deal! This just proves that she's not worthy of you. We’ll talk about it after the war. Just a moment. They took your cast off today. Great! Well, come on. Go ahead! Go on, go ahead, go on… He bewitched him! The boss has a knack! He can do that. But in his own affairs… I'm not surprised at all that she left him. - Doctor Anna is not coming back here? - And she’d better not come back! These two are ready to fight over her. - Which two? - Are you playing dumb? I’ve seen many such stories before the war. You say they’ll fight? You don’t know them, Nurse! I don’t know them! Rubbish! - It’s a war romance and he’d like… - I say otherwise. He’ll marry her. Who? Well… one of them, anyway. Do you think I don't know anything about it? I am a women's hairdresser. You’re a women's hairdresser, and I'm an old civilian midwife. And there are no secrets for me. She left and she’d better not come back. She’s here! There! - Oh, Doctor Anna! - How do I get there? You need to go around, through the isthmus. Well, help me a little. Doctor… he doesn't say anything. He doesn't hear me. He's unconscious. He’s got shrapnel in his thigh and lost a lot of blood. Doctor… He should live. We'll do everything we can. Surgery is necessary. He must be sent home. - Has the plane showed up? - I’ll see. What about him? Tie the Esmarch tourniquet. It's only for two hours, then necrosis. That’ll do for transport. They’ll have to manage. All right. - Is he someone close to you? - We're in the same theatre. Yes, someone close. The condition is quite serious. He’ll be flown home for surgery. There’re specialists there. Can you help him here? Now? In this hospital we’ll do dressings or amputations. But he’s an actor! What can he do without a leg? So, he must be flown back immediately. But will he? Doctor… Please, do something. Help him regain consciousness. I have to tell him something. I have to! - Even if he were conscious, it... But it's very important and it won't do any harm. Comrade! Why don't you go down to the wardrobe? We have a concert in a moment. We still have two units to go to today. - And he? - Too bad. That’s their business. We can have faith in our medics, right, Captain? I'd like to see him before his departure. - Nobody showed up from the plane? - Not so far. - We can’t get through to the division. - And we're sitting here in this hole. Listen, I wanted to talk to you. Are you missing the front? I’d like to ask you for a transfer. I’m a frontline soldier. What’s the good of me being here? I thought there was something keeping you here. Walek… actually I should explain to you… - that this story with Anna... - No point. It's clear. - No, it’s because you don’t know… - No need. It’s your business. But I… They say there are no guilty parties in these matters. Maybe. I don’t blame you. If you want a transfer, by all means. That’s okay then. Let's go to the commandant's office. Maybe we’ll get connected. - What is it for? There’s a war, and… - The war is Schluss, and one must eat. One must live! How come you understand Polish? Me understand a little. Polish people here, working. A labour camp. Go to Nurse Margiel. You’ll help her with the concert. Yes, Citizen Captain! - Piotr, how are things? - Couldn’t be better. I’m moving my hand already. - It’s only this leg… - Don’t worry. You’ll be dancing soon. - That’s most important! - Really? Yeah! First Sunday after the war I’ll have my wedding. Cigarette? Cigarette? - Where did you get it? - From the army. From them. When will we go back to France? Comprenez? Hitler kaputt, n’est-ce pas? The war is over, comme ci, comme ça! Ah, mon cher, quand retournera-t-on en France? A Paris? I think he’s asking when we will send them home. To Paris, of all places! The war is not over yet. Yeah, the war! La guerre, n’est ce pas? - The war is over! - Hitler kaputt! Of course! Madame, please, smoke! Damn it! What are you doing, man?! Are you blind? Captain, do you have a fishing hook, by any chance? There are pikes like that here! Go to the cook. He’s an old angler. Thank you. A critical situation. Hitler kaputt! Jesus Christ! - Are the roads to the city secure? - Yes. There’re posts at the dams. Damn, where are you pushing to? Marys! Come! Eviva Comandante! How’s life? - Get out of there! - Don’t yell, I’m coming! - People want peace. - They finally have it. Too early to celebrate. Check the posts, I’ll be at the commandant's office. - Sir, we want to join the Polish Army. - Where are you from? From near Zamosc, but we left it when the war started. - Where are your parents? - They were shot in Krasnystaw. - Take them to the cook. - But we want… - And then you’ll go… - But Boss! Hey! Halt! That’s him! He strangled my mother. Stop! - He's from Gross-Rosen! - A criminal! He killed many people! The commandant is coming! Citizen Captain, apparently our troops are in Berlin. It is true? It is. The Lord’s Saints had mercy on us! It’s not the Saints that trashed the Germans, but the Russians! I’ve come about a pass to Berlin. Man, it's Walus! The commander doesn't recognize me? It’s me, Kurak from Chlodna Street. Do you want to go back to Chlodna Street via Berlin? My house was destroyed, so why should I hurry? Anyhow, I don’t insist. Captain, has Teofilow burned down? The one near Tomaszow. - And is Szewna all right? - What Szewna? Szewna near Ostrowiec, we are from there. I do not know. It’s the Sandomierz stronghold. If it was burnt, you’ll have to rebuild it. Yes, Captain! Are you the commandant here? Because we want to get married. - I’m from Mlawa. - A the lady? She doesn't understand Polish. She’s Italian. Do you understand Italian? - No. I have no head for languages. - So how do you communicate? - Why? We can get along. - Do you know some Polish? Si, si, signora. Hitler kaputt. So how about that wedding? It's allowed now, right? Now that the government is ours. Why such a hurry? Wouldn’t it be better to wait a little? We’ve been waiting for two years. Doing forced labour. The Germans didn’t allow it. I can arrange your wedding, but you’ll get the papers in Mlawa. Citizen Commander, Dr Anna is waiting here. She parachuted from the plane. Will you invite me to the wedding? You had an accident. We were shot at by the Germans with machine guns. Strange. Yesterday there were no Germans within 60 km. It was an armoured car. Maybe a gang of leftover forces? Although… Whom did you fly with? With Pietia. He was flying for an injured actor, so I came with him. What about the plane? The engine is damaged. I had to jump. The pilot is injured. He tried to land. Gawra! Yes, Sir. Find the plane and bring the pilot. - And get Lieutenant Basior over here. - Yes, Sir. - Who was to fly with the injured? - Me. You? I got permission to transfer. The war is nearly over, so, what is there here for me? Where were you shot at from? From here, from the forest. Well, you'll have to stay with us a little longer. The plane probably won't fly. And even if I stayed… - would it change anything? - Yeah. I don't think it would. Apparently, we have some Germans here. Must be a gang of leftover forces. Quite a few of them roam around. Captain, we have a call. It’s the army staff. I’m coming. I’ve asked Walek for a transfer to the frontline. He agreed. I also have a transfer to another hospital. Yes. The chance that we should meet again is almost none. I believe I deserve a few words from you. We weren't supposed to talk about it. It was a misunderstanding. It shouldn’t be like that. I don't want anything from you. I understand that I’m not a match for you. But think it over. Janek… I must explain everything to you. You see, the story with Walek, it wasn’t just a casual relationship. We lived together, it seemed that everything was fine… but I often didn't know what he wanted from me. He looked at me as if he constantly required something of me. It felt as if he wasn’t satisfied with the way I am. It means he doesn't love me. I felt unhappy. I wanted to break away. And you know… And now I know that it was the greatest happiness. - You didn’t know that earlier? - No. I know nothing about it. I was watching both of you, I saw that you were unhappy. For me, you were the best. And he? He demanded from you more than from others. I don’t know, maybe for him this is love. But for me, I sometimes… When you came to me, I felt as if I had won the lottery. If you want to, I’ll quit the army when the war is over. Although, fighting is the only thing I know. But I’ll do whatever you want. Maybe you’ll get to love me one day. I love him and that's why I can't love anybody else. He’ll never forgive you. I don't count on it. I know it's finished with him. You wouldn't get along with him. To get along with him, you’d have to have a character. Looks like I didn’t. Do you know what “a character” means for him? I don’t, but nothing will help me now. The situation looks serious. Communication has broken down. They only managed to say that there are unexpected enemy movements from the south all over the front. Anna, what did you see on the way? We were flying this way. Here, we turned towards Lyx… And we were shot at from there. The river crossing was again destroyed by our bombers. The enemy has at least 3 hours of transport interruptions. That means we have 3 hours. Yes, during this time we can advance via the highway. Here, through this isthmus, between the two lakes. - Correct. It’s the only passageway. - Yes. And the nest on the isthmus? You mean von Lyx? He should actually be back now. Right. Then I order highest alert. - With immediate effect! - Yes, Sir! Miss Frania, have you see Makowski? I've been looking for him for half an hour. You’re always looking for Makowski! Just wait a while and I'll look for someone else! They call it by various names! Hairdresser, barber, coiffeur… In Russian it’s “parikmacher”! I was the backbone of the Samson and Delilah Salon at Chorza Street! That’s right! The most beautiful ladies were at my feet after a permanent wave. Really! But I captured the skyscraper in Napoleon's Square single-handedly. That’s right! If that cavemen wouldn’t sell Warsaw for two pfennigs… Have you seen Makowski? Yesterday evening you were in quite a state. Egregious lie! Makowski’s sleeping under the car. Makowski! Makowski! - What? - Get out, come on! You’ll go towards Braunau. You are to find the ambulance plane and its pilot. It was a forced landing. You'll need two men for the stretcher, right? We’ll go! Let us go, Corporal. - Let us go! - Get in. I’d have driven on my own, had it not been for the Germans! Halt, halt! - What’s that gibberish? Move, or… - Wait. He is right. Can't you find another way? His vegetables will freeze… His arse will freeze! They destroyed Warsaw and he’s giving me that shit! It's not yours, you stupid yokel! Why are you defending your master’s property? His master fled and he stayed. He’s doing his work, respect that. People must eat. Get stuffed with your preaching! He’s right. It’s not mine. I’m just a servant. Why has he gone? - And the land? - The land? Use your brain. - There. - Danke schön. - There, take it. - Danke schön, danke schön. You think I had land, huh? But I have it now. Put it out! Give it to him! We don’t fight with civilians. Hitler kaputt. My God, Herr Baron! What luck that you returned - safely from the war. - Where is the old man? On the other side of the River Elbe. -He’s already with the Americans. -Listen Horst... What about dinner? It was supposed to be earlier. We start the show in a minute. Well, take it. We are assigned to the artists as dressers. We won’t be carrying it today. Get someone to help them. Hallo! Herr German! Herr German! Come here, come! Helfen, n'est-ce pas? Have you got something for the worms? Maybe a box? A box? Don’t you know where a true angler keeps worms? That’s what I do. Please, don’t do it! Just listen to me, - and you’ll be okay. - No, I want nothing to do with that. Think about it well. It could cost you your stupid peasant’s head. ... you open an overcast sky with lightning! Let us cleanse the native house, both from our ashes and holy ruins and from our sins and cursed faults. Let it be poor, but clean, our house raised from the cemetery. To the land waking up from the dead, made golden by the dawn of freedom, give the rule of wise, simple people, strong in wisdom and goodness” What are you doing here? Who are you? - The gardener. Kitchen. A gardener in the kitchen? What are those kitchen guys doing sending people from the street to a military hospital? It’s here! Here's the commandant! Thanks guys! A Russian soldier! Did you see? Here's the commandant, that door! Hello! Pietia! Are you injured? - It's nothing! - How do you feel after the accident? It’s just a scratch! A little dressing and I’ll be able to fly. The state of emergency had been ordered. Tomala is with the people at the dam. I'm going to them now. - Well, let them try now! - It’d be better if they wouldn’t. That’s just in case. Here, you can defend yourself against an entire army. What with? The security platoon, convalescents, we have machine guns… The captured mortar and the Panzerfausts that are lying around! What about the hundreds of refugees? The wounded, women, children? Let's just say the Germans will attack here. We'll take our civilians and the wounded this way. In the meantime, I’ll hold the isthmus. We'll see who wins! It may come to it that the medical corps will trash them. Hold your horses, Lieutenant. You’re right, it’s a good place for defence, but it’s better to lie low. The captain is right. Leave it to us. I’ll take the wounded from here and get the message to the right people. And our forces will take care of those gentlemen. My advice is – don’t get involved in this. How will you transport the wounded? What about the plane? We towed it to the city. Your people helped me. And can it fly? Sure! I am a Cossack! Our women fly on brooms. And this is a good Soviet plane. So what, Doctor? Shall we fly? The dressing first. Compagno! Eviva! Greeting, Comrades. So, are we going home? Take care. Long live the Red Army! Look! - A boy or a girl? - A boy. How is it going? Everything all right? Come on, baby! Hey, darling! How are you! Hello, friends! Victory! Hurrah! - Matthew, where are you going? - Wait a minute. - America? - Yes, American. Thanks. - Do you speak English? - Who, me? Sure! - Happy to see you, Comrade! - Greetings! - Hello! Commandant, Sir! - I’m not the commandant. That’s him! Hello, Commandant. Do you speak English? And have you forgotten Polish? So, you are not Russian? There are Poles here. So, this is that army of yours. Very nice. We were all in the camp and the compatriots of your Soviet officer liberated us yesterday. Now my fellow Allies want to go back to their people. Well, the war is not over yet. Come on, let’s dance, everybody! Joe, music! Will you dance with me? - The Lieutenant is asking you to dance. - After the war. - What are you saying? - After the war. I see! - Smoke? - Dance! Let's go! Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Kurak. Wojnik. How nice it is to see a real Polish officer again. Because those here... is it supposed to be an army? Have you seen this captain? His father was a janitor in my tenement house. In Warsaw, at Chlodna Street. - You know, one with a broom. - Well, I never! Is he a professional military man? No way! He’s supposed to be a doctor. The Soviets gave him a diploma. A janitor papa and a subversive son. Before the war, he was doing porridge all the time. - And those people will govern us now? - And will they? It’s not certain yet. Nil desperandum. Exactly, if that Nil would… In order to govern, you need support. Adequate support. - But most of all, you need some patience. - But for how long? We’ll come out on top yet, Mr Kurak. Like this. Not like this, Herr von Lyx. But like this! Towards Berlin! That sounds like marching orders. It’s neither here nor there. First we have to take Lyx Well yes, Lyx. The Poles don’t have anti-tank weapons. - I have a plan. - Just a moment, Herr Sturmführer. First of all we have to check the area. Heil Hitler! Herr Obersturmbandführer, four deserters. Fine. Listen! You take an MG and with your team you secure the road east of Lyx. - There, you will wait for us. Clear? - Yes Sir! I want no one to get through! Do you understand? Yes, Herr Obersturmbannführer. The way through the garden is best, and then past the castle. We avoid the anti-tank barrier then. Just a moment! - Well? - Give me 3 tanks and I guarantee to take the Nest without a single shot and secure the passage way. Very well. After all, it’s your land. Not bad! Your old man was always a real gentleman, Herr von Lyx. Didn’t the Poles do him any harm? He already left. He is on the other side of the River Elbe. Oh I see, he’s with the Americans! And you would like to be there, too? How dare you talk to me like this? I am not under your command. As staff liaison officer I report directly to the SS commander-in-chief. Alright. You shall have your 3 tanks. So, we can go, right? Or maybe you’ve changed your mind, doctor? Well, Anushka, I have a feeling that some emotional affairs are holding you here. Even if. It’s war and I wear a uniform. And what’s under the uniform? One mustn’t be ashamed of human feelings. Let’s not talk about it. But that’s why you are sad. If one doesn’t love, one doesn’t feel like living. Am I right? I am. Aren’t there plenty of nice guys here? Take me, for example. Wouldn’t I make a good fiancée? Just say the word… Forgive me, I was joking. Well, get dressed, we’re off. Yes. We must hurry, because it might get quite hot here. I tell you something, Anushka. Let’s be honest. If you have any unfinished business here, attend to it quickly. It’s always better to talk about things honestly, otherwise… Talking won’t help. Let’s go. You swine! Come on, Hans, let’s go! A letter from home? My mother. It’s tough, man. - It’s spring. - Ja, ja. Work the land, keine Leute. And one can’t go home. The war. If it should start, then run! If anything, run over there, to your people. What? What may happen? I know nothing. You are pussyfooting around. - I saw einen Mann. - Who? - A man. - Who was it? - Von Lyx. The son. SS. - Was he alone? Allein? Ja. He was alone. But he’ll be back. And then not alone. If anything, you run there! - And you? - I gave my permission. If I'm going to fly with him now, he must get 300 ml of blood, otherwise… - Take the blood from me. - We have plenty in store. Please bring a bag of blood group 0. What about him? It’s not going to work anymore. - Miss Frania… - I don’t have time. Since the artists came here, you don’t notice me at all anymore. That’s something! I know, you like artists, doctors, bombardiers. - Humble Figaro doesn't matter no more. - What are you on about? - Have you seen the Captain? - He must be where Frania is. - Don’t joke, man! - Will you believe if I say he’s here? - There’s a fire, you idiot! - Fire! Fool! The river’s on fire. Alright, guys. Tomala, we should send somebody to search the edge of the forest. Eh, Lieutenant! There are no Germans here. Look, tanks! Damn, they came from the side! Look! They tricked us. Wait! Stop! Don’t shoot! Come out, you bastard! He was here today, as a civilian! I swear to it. Yes! I gave him some pea soup! He was spying! Hang the bastard! Now! Let them through! Treat the injured. Take the officer for questioning. Giannina! Giannina! - What was it, Major? - I don’t know, a tank? I'm going to the commandant. To find out what’s happening. - To Paszkot? - He should know something. You are completely locked in. No one can escape from here. To hope for a rescue mission is completely pointless. But you do have one chance to save your live. You have nothing to fear, Herr Hauptmann. We are not barbarians. The entire field hospital will remain intact. No one will get hurt. I am von Lyx, Staff Liaison Officer for SS Reichsführer, Heinrich Himmler, and I give you my word. The word of honour of a German officer. Did you understand me? Yes. So, your fate is in your hands. You have to capitulate now. Yes! You have to surrender to me. Thank you. Take the prisoner out. You have to surrender immediately! Not a stone will be left here in 30 minutes! It’s you. He’s right. To surrender is an honourable solution! At worst, we’ll stay in captivity for a few hours. Well, maybe a few days. How will you fight with the wounded and a crowd from all over Europe? You’ll hold the Germans for a few hours. - Forgive me, but… - So, will you defend yourself here? MINOR SURGERY ROOM AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY Start the evacuation, immediately. - Shall we evacuate the hospital? - Not only the hospital. In half an hour there must be - no injured or civilians in the city. - Where should we evacuate them to? - To the other side. - Across the water?! That’s the only available road. We are surrounded. A large unit is going this way to Berlin. But how to get across the water? You’ll have to manage somehow. Yes, but…! We will try to hold them off, until you get people across. Meanwhile, we’ll get on with the surgery. Right. It’s better now. Justyna! Oh, the window pane has gone… Can you see me? Do you hear me? I love you. I have for a long time. You don't know how much I wanted to tell you, when… well, you know… If it's true what you said then, remember this - I love you, too. You have to live, do you hear? Just don’t leave me. I haven't been fishing for 5 years. And there are pikes here like that! Here, in this lake! - Well, and what? - Man! He’s crazy! The Germans are coming! They’ll kill us because he’s opposing them. In half an hour a hell will break loose here! Oh, my God! Germans! Germans! People, the Germans! It’s Himmler’s liaison officer. He must be sent off immediately. Who will fly with him? - You. You were supposed to fly today. And the actor? He can’t fly with the German. No. - He must have an operation. - We’ll have to operate now. - An amputation? - No. We can try to remove the shrapnel, sew up the artery and take him go across the lake like the others. Who will do it? Probably I. Well, you have to be off. Let’s go see the pilot. Walek. The German can be escorted by someone else. Two surgeons would be useful for such an operation. I know, what you’re thinking. But it doesn't matter now. I'm not leaving here. I have to be with you. I don't want anything else. I’m ready. Instead of the patient, take this guy to the crossing and hand him over. - All right. - Give them that. Maybe they’ll hurry up. Okay, I'll rush them. So, Doctor, are we going? An escort will fly with you. Don't waste your time. Right. All the best. Goodbye. Take care. We are off. Jesus Christ, Germans! Help! Germans! Hurry up! Blimey, Germans! They’ll kill us! And me? Major, what about me? What about me? A tank! Maniek! Watch out! The damn thing broke down! Get off, all of you! That’s right! Just like that! You’re too delicate. There is a way! All civilians to gather by the gate. You will be taken to a safe place. - How? - Where to? Across the lake! - Which way? - Across the lake! The soldiers will defend the town until the last man leaves. Lieutenant, I fought with guerrillas. I can help. - We'll help. - I’ll be useful as well. Choose the people you want. That gate must be fortified. - Can I help you with something? - You can go, too. What about us? We cannot wait. In 2 hours, we have a concert at an armoured unit. Then do something to get this unit to come to here. But we want to do something. You can help Nurse Margiel. Take the prisoners with you. - That's just what I need! - Too bad, they can't stay here. Take the prisoners to the crossing, to Nurse Margiel. - The war is not over yet. - Well? Do you think I'm crazy? It’s 5 to 12. There’s no time to die. - Only we have a chance! - The war is still going on! We ought to give them a hand and not run away! It’s not fair! Oh, I see. You don’t like it? All right, you can stay right here. - It’s not fair! - Don’t talk so much! It’s not your goddamn job! Do you know what I mean, kid? - It’s not fair! - Shut up! Major, what’s going on here? We don’t intend to die at 5 to 12. Well, yes, but what to do? - Back to captivity for a few days. - To the Germans? We reckon it's not that bad. We'll get by. After all, the Germans are cultured people. Major, what about me? I want to live, too! You can bring the wounded. It’s a long time since we’ve operated together. This time everything will be fine. Walek… I always loved only you. And I loved you. Now, everything will be all right. Did you know that I stopped that tank? With a bottle! Don't bother me. There should be some boats here. They are probably on the other side. Save the ammunition. We have to hold them off as long as possible. I'll come after the surgery. You finish and make your way across. And we will… if they come, then… Calm down. We’ll hold out here, until the wounded and civilians are in a safe place. We have to live. For the longest possible time. He took off. Stop! God damn it, who’s there? One moment! Major Wojnik! Sergeant Tomala from the 28th Kaniowski Rifle Regiment. - You, here? - I serve as usual. They are still quiet, huh? This is not the place for you, Sergeant. And where am I to go? With us. Across the Elbe, to the allies. But the Germans will attack soon. Our cowboys are following the Germans. We’ll be in their hand shortly. Major, it’s our duty! Duty… You are a real non-com. Maybe I’m a non-com, but I’m not a swine. You are allowed to be a fool, Tomala, but we must pass this way! There was no order. Maybe you'll shoot me, Sergeant, eh? Your former commander? Let’s go. Sergeant, is it… Kurt 3. Kurt 3. I can see deserters. Among them American prisoners. What prisoners? Nonsense. Too late. Just finish them off. They’ll kill them all! Tomala, Tomala! At the edge of the forest, 50 meters from the road. Enemy LMG! Open fire! Use mines! Stop! To hell with such fun! Everyone get ashore! Well! Now! Get out! - Get the sick and injured on board! - Everyone come ashore! - Be gone! - Quick, get out of here! Let the injured pass! You, Officer! Get out! Do you have arms and legs? Then help! Now! Give me a few shells. I don’t have any. - Just be careful. - Because? Because they’re not blanks. Go and help them. - Jozio! - Jozek! Giannina! Come back! The attack will start in 10 minutes, from the southern entrance to Lyx. - Off you go! - Yes Sir! - Mr Szczezuja! - Yeah? Great! It’s a fleet! A clamp. Give it here. Aren’t you going home? - I’m waiting for you. - I’ll be right back. Hurry up! It’s stuck! Retreat to the barricades, I am covering you. - You, to the crossing, right now! - Lieutenant! Run, now! Give me a tommy-gun! Hang in here, I take my position on the tower. Tie it up. Captain! The Germans are at the gate. Go back, we’ll manage here. Hans! Get near the castle and disable that machine gun! Yes, Sir! Captain, I report that this will be the last one. - That’s all of them. - Leave immediately. Damn it! The Krauts are in the castle! Good job that you hurried up. Go and wait for me. Shit! The lieutenant won't hold out for long! Szczezuja and you come with me. You go to the crossing. Szczezuja, follow me! The rest of you wait! Come here! - Help! - Stop! Wait! - Well, that’s all. - Yes. And the doctor? - What is it? Where are you taking it? - Why? I found it. Look! Look! Look! Tanks! It’s our army! Is this the town of Lyx? - Yes, that’s Lyx! - Let’s go then! Stop, stop. Stay here! Damn it! THE END
