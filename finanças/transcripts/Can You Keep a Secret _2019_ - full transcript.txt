And we think if people find out who we really are, they won't stick around. So we make our way through life trying to hide our vulnerabilities. The problem is, that's a lot harder than it sounds. And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, but at the end of the day, we're all just trying to do the best we can. Take me for example. I pretend to know what I'm doing, but I am so far from figuring out what life is all about. [Doug] Couple things I wanna talk about. Logistical, formative alliances. Absolutely. [Emma] Let alone what this guy is trying to say. But I do know I have to land this account to get my promotion. Or my future could very well end up looking like that. [Doug] Chuck? You got anything to add? You good? All right. Chuck's good. The point is, unfortunately, uh, after rebranding, these products are just incompatible. And our, our clientele, they just... -they can't pay... -Sorry. Uh... -Doug. -Yes? Um, I don't want to... Just to do... I'm just, uh... Just recap the situation? Oh, okay. A little recap. Chuck, let's see what you got. Recapping? [Doug] Okay. This is what we got. We don't like your prices. -My pricings? -Yes. I don't... but I... I don't price anything. Okay. We're... We're done. I think... -Wait. No, hold on. -Well, it's time to go. I just have two points to make. -[Emma] Um... -[Chuck sighs] [exhales sharply] Panda Prime is an organic energy drink. Panda is a marketing phenomenon. The Panda character is known around the world, and that slogan, "Don't Pause", has made it into the dictionary. We are offering Shoreview Cruises an exclusive opportunity to join with this premium, world famous brand. When customers buy Panda Prime, they are saying that they will settle for nothing but the best. They expect the best from their energy drink. -[sighs] -[Emma] They expect the best from their cruise. And they expect the best from themselves. [sighs] [clicks tongue] I, um... I hate to burst your bubble. [Doug] That was a great speech. That was really, really, really good speech, but have you seen our clientele? Right behind me. [Doug] Right over here. Take a look at 'em. And I don't wanna say we're proud, but we're not ashamed. Look, when Panda customers open this can, -they're saying who they are. -[thuds] They're making a statement. I am asking Shoreview Cruises to make that same statement. [fizzing] Shit! [gasps] [Emma and Doug gasp] [whimpers] Please don't tell my boss. [light music] [man on PA] This is the final boarding call for flight 2816 nonstop service to Chicago... Hey. Hey. Hey, how'd it go? It was a certifiable disaster. You realize this is my third job in four years. [Lissy sighs] Sweetie. I'm, I'm sorry. -And I'm boarding soon. -[Lissy] Remember. Thousands of people fly every day. -Yeah. -[Lissy] It's like... safer than lying down in bed. Great. I'll remember that when I'm sleeping tonight. [Emma whispers] Excuse me, can I? Thank you. [thunder rumbling] -[Emma] Hi. -[flight attendant 1] Hi. How you doing? I'm in 32F. Hasn't been your day, has it? No, not really. How about an upgrade to first class? -Really? -Yeah. -[Emma] Okay. -Seat 2A. [Emma] Thank you. -[woman 1] Hi. -[flight attendant 2] Champagne? [woman 1] Thanks. [flight attendant 1] Hello. [gasps, chuckles] [flight attendant 2] Champagne, miss? [flight attendant 3] Ladies and gentlemen... -Champagne? -Yes! Thank you. [flight attendant 3] ...direct service to JFK Thank you. [flight attendant 3] Place carry-on bags in the overhead compartment. [flight attendant 2] Champagne, miss? Your champagne, sir. All right, cheers. Cheers! [in soft voice] It's my phone. Uh, yeah, no, no. I'm here. Somebody thought I was talking to them. Um, yeah, so I'll see you guys, uh, next month. [light music] [whirring] Excuse me, ma'am. Uh, that's unacceptable. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Uh, good evening, sir. -Hi. -Hi. -[sighs] -Would you be interested in, um, the new business class lounge at JFK? -Oh, no. Thanks. -[rumbles] -[yelps] -[Emma] Oh, my god. Is that normal? -[crowd gasp] -[man 1] Oh, my god! -Did we hit something? -[flight attendant 4] Uh... We're currently experiencing some slight turbulence. Please remain seated until the captain has turned off the fasten seatbelt sign. [captain]This is your captain. Hold on. - We're gonna be... -Oh, shit! -[captain speaking indistinctly] -[screaming] Oh, my god! [Emma] This is it. We're gonna die! No, no. Yeah, yeah. It's just some turbulence. What do you think they're gonna say? They're not gonna say "This is it. You're all gonna die" That would make everyone freak out! This is it, though. [passengers screaming] [Emma] I haven't done anything with my life! [sobbing] I haven't done anything! I haven't climbed a mountain. I've never had kids. I never got a tattoo. I don't even know if I have a G-spot. -Excuse me? -[Emma] I think that I'm someone that I don't have one of those. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just say that out loud? That's okay. You can keep talking. [passengers screaming] [Emma] My career's a joke. I just messed up my first big meeting and I'm not gonna get a promotion. And there's this awful girl named Artemis... [Emma] She got a promotion over me, and so I water her stupid spider plant with orange juice. I wish that I could pee standing up. I wish that I knew what it was like to have a penis. [screaming] [Emma] Every single time I hear "Demons" by Imagine Dragons, I cry instantly. Even thinking about it makes me cry. And my boyfriend, Connor, he's obsessed with jazz. And he took me to all these jazz concerts, and I pretend to like it but I hate jazz. I hate jazz. [sobbing] [Emma] And Connor does this really weird thing with his tongue, but I told him that it was amazing... and that my whole body opened up like a flower, and he asked... [gasps] What kind of flower? [Emma] So I said... Begonia? I don't think that I've ever really been in love, and I don't think anyone's ever really loved me. I just want, like, this huge, amazing romance, like this, like, earthquake. Like if I could just... -Excuse me. -[beeps] [flight attendant 2] Ladies and gentlemen... -What? -Sorry. We, we landed. What? [flight attendant 2] If you checked baggage, you can pick it up at carousel... Turbulence stopped like a half hour ago. Why didn't you tell me that? Seems like you had a few things to get off your chest. Oh, my god! Oh, my god. Okay. I have to go. Oh. [car revving] Emma! You're alive! Connor. [panting] -[Connor sighs] -Mmm. -I missed you. -Me too. [Connor] What happened to you? Just a little turbulence. Turbulence? No, I got your text that said... "We're in a death spiral, not gonna make it. Know that I loofah you." I mean, I know what that meant. I just wanna go home. Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Oh, oh, Emma. I don't know what I'd do without you. I, I've been thinking... I'm thinking that it's time that we take our relationship to the next level. Emma... we should move in together. Well? [Emma] Okay. [sobbing] Oh. Oh, you're very sad. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's okay. -[whimpers] -It's okay, baby. It's okay. Let's go in, let's go in the car. -Let's go in the car. -[Emma sobbing] Jeez, how bad was the flight? [chuckles] There you go, okay. There's a quiet, safe place to cry. -Tootsies in. -[car door closes] [upbeat jazz music] [Connor] Like a little angel. [Emma grunts] You look so heavenly perfect. [snoring] I wanna die in each other's arms. [snores] Oh, shit! I can't believe I get to wake up to this every morning. [Emma] What? When you move in! Oh, yeah. Right. -[Connor] Espresso? -Oh, yeah. [groans] Pronto. [Connor] ♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo I got this new Colombian blend. It is... to die for. -Yeah? -Oh. Almost forgot to tell you. Guess what I got tickets for? [Connor] The Bjorn Svornson Quartet. Wow. It's gonna be their last show of the year. That's great. Almost forgot the saucers. But we need them because if you spill in the bed, I will be very upset. [Emma chuckles softly] [chuckling] [sighs] Here comes the espresso train. Choo-choo! Madame. Thank you. [Connor sighs] [groans] [slurps] Fruit. Lot of nut. [Connor] Lot of nut in this. Ooh. [clicks tongue] That's smooth. [Connor] I'll see you at the office. I've got to do a two. -[Connor] ♪ Doo-doo-doo-doo -[groans] [Casey] I was up till midnight - caulking her tub. -[Emma] Ugh. [Casey] She's not using me, is she? Well, of course she's using you. She's just... looking for a free handyman. Yeah, I should have realized. She asked me on our first date if I had plumbing or roofing experience. [sighs] I have the worst taste in women. No, no you don't. It's not your fault. I mean, how are you supposed to know? -There's no way to know. -[Casey sighs] I'm not gonna cry at work. [Emma] I'll be there for you. If you really need to. But let's do it privately this time. [indistinct chatter] [Emma] What the heck is going on? Hey, Nick. What's going on? Jack Harper's visiting. [Emma] Who? Are you serious? Well, he only co-founded the company you work for. I thought he had a breakdown after Pete Laddler died? Well, looks like he's back in the game. -[Casey] That's gotta be him. -[Nick] Yeah. That's gotta be him. Are you being sarcastic? -You know... -[shushes] [Cybill] Corrigan! Okay, stay strong. Good luck. Hi. Did you forget to take your meds or something? -No. -[Cybill] I'm... just trying to understand the phone call I just got from Chicago. I mean, is this some kind of psychotic break that we're dealing with? Is this a manic state? Some Kanye at The White House shit? What the fuck happened -to Shoreview? -Nothing. Did you really pour a drink on Doug Hamilton? No. It was like a tiny little bit of spray. Like, I was gesticulating with the can. I was passionate about, the, the product. And I just... -I was just like gesticulating. -Were you... were you doing this in the meeting? I just, it got shook up. -Stop doing that with your hand! -[Emma] It just... It was like that much, though. -Shh. -Okay. Just clean up your desk. -What? -You're firing me? I... Learn to listen, Corrigan. I said clean it up, not out. [Cybill] Jack Harper will be here in a few minutes. And if you spill Panda Prime on him, then you're fucking gone. -[Emma] I'm not gonna spill... -Shh! Okay, everyone. Listen up! [Cybill] This is an informal visit, nothing more. Mr. Harper will come in, maybe talk to one or two of you, so act normal... [in soft voice] ...just better. Not a really great meeting for you, was it there, Emma? Savage. [Artemis] Cybill's not really liking you today. [Nick and Artemis chuckle] Okay, everyone. He's on the floor. So go about your everyday task. Now! [sighs] [sniffs] [sighs] [Cybill] Jack. Everyone, may I have your attention, please. It is my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce... our founding father. The man who has influenced and inspired an entire generation of marketers. The inimitable... Jack Harper. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Cybill. Everybody. And who's this? [Cybill] Ah. This is Emma Corrigan. One of our junior marketing assistants. Hi, Emma. Hello, Mr. Harper. It's very nice to meet you. [Jack] Uh, it's nice to meet you. Show the man who you are. [chuckles] [Jack] Now, Emma, what, what do you do, Emma? I work in the marketing department. Emma was just in Chicago on business. We try to give our junior staff responsibilities early as possible. [Jack] That's a great idea. I could use a coffee. How's, how's the coffee here? The coffee is absolute poison. It's fricking terrible! [coughs] It's... It's delicious. That's great. Good to hear. [Cybill] And this is Artemis Harrington, one of our brightest young executives. -Hi, sir. -Hi. -Oh, my goodness. Are you okay? -[chuckles] Yes. Bonjour. -[Jack] Oh, you're French. -Two percent. Well, um, I like your, I like your spider plant. Thank you, sir. It's, um, looks very healthy. [Cybill] And this is Nick. He's another one of our junior marketing executives. -Mr. Harper. -Nice to meet you. -Call me Nicky. -[Jack] Um... Well, I'm sure I'll get to meet all of you at some point, and, uh... look forward to getting to know some of you a little bit better. [Cybill] Right this way, Jack. Au revoir! You're from Pittsburgh. [keyboard clacking] -Hi. -[Emma] Hi. [clicks tongue] So... [chuckles] [Jack] So... -[exhales sharply] -[Jack chuckles softly] What a coincidence. -It's good to see you again. -Yeah. -How are you? -I, I'm good. How are you? [Emma] Good. The world works in such mysterious ways. -Yeah. -[Emma] Doesn't it? -It does. -[chuckles] [smacks lips] So... Jack... Harp... Mr. Harper... In my defense, I had no idea who you were. So I don't think that I should... be peen-alized. You, you don't think I should penalize you? Is that how you pronounce it? Pen... penalized? The penalty flag, not a "peenalty" flag Right. Now that you say it, "peenalized", -It's weird. -[Jack chuckles] -[Jack] I, uh... -It's like "penis". Sorry. Neither of us are wrong. [sighs] You're gonna fire me. Please don't fire me. -I'm gonna like... -I'm not gonna fire you. Great. Great. Thank you. [sighs] [Jack] But I am gonna ask for a favor. I would really like it if nobody knew that I was in Chicago. Do you think we could keep that between us? Yeah. -[Jack] Yeah? -Of course. Of course. -You haven't told anybody? -[Emma] No. No. I'm like a steel trap. Like, nothing goes in and nothing comes out. [Emma] Well stuff goes in, it's like... like one of these, you know? It's like a... Venus fly trap. Like you get in there, and then... [grunts] you die in there. In like... [inhales sharply] So it all goes in and it dies in here. -I feel very safe. -[Emma] Good. -Yeah. -And the same thing goes for you, though, like... everything I said... [sighs] Dies with me. To the grave. So... [clicks tongue] We're both dying with each other's secrets. -[chuckles] -[Jack] Yes. That's quite intimate. [clears throat] So, you've really never been in love? [exhales sharply] Did I say that? No, I didn't, right? Oh, I mean... I mean, who really even knows what love is? No one has any goddamn idea what love is on this entire planet. And I'll tell you that, as a fact. Mm-hm. [upbeat music] [Emma] Lissy? [thuds] Hey, Lissy. Need to talk to you. -[Lissy] Emma. -[Emma] Hey. -Hi. -[Lissy] You're early. [Lissy] You're home. You're home early. [Emma] Oh, hi. Hi. -[Lissy] This is, um... -[Emma] So sorry. -This is Omar. -Hi. -Hi. -Um, Emma, my roommate. -Hi, pleasure to meet you. -Hi. Yeah, you too. Omar and I were just reviewing some case notes. -Cool. That's fun. -Mm-hm. Yeah, it's fun, but it's work. And we're, we're just swamped at work, aren't we? -Of course. Mm-hm. -Yeah. -So... -Yeah. Well, you know, I think we got to a good place. We can pick it up tomorrow. -Yeah. -Okay, I should be going now. -See you tomorrow. -Great, nice meeting you. -Yeah, you too. -Yeah. Have a really good day. [Lissy sighs] [door opens, closes] Wow. -So... -[Lissy] He's new. He's, yeah, I'm kind of, showing him the ropes. -Great. -Yeah, great. He's like, kind of, ripped for a lawyer. -Is he? -You didn't notice that? -[Lissy] Well... -That he was, uh, attractive? Yeah, I guess he is. I guess he is. I just see him so much at work, I guess I'm used to, like, his physique. Totally. I believe you. -That looks good. -[Emma] Yeah. You look like you need it. Is there a man here? [Gemma] I thought I, like, smelled a presence or something. -He left. -[Lissy] Yeah. He's my co-worker. [Gemma sighs] Did you finish the quiz? Yeah. -What quiz? -[Lissy] It's this article. Says that proportions of beauty have always been the same, so you can figure out how beautiful you are. Scientifically. What did you get? I'm a 33. Out of what? -A hundred. -That's ridiculous. [Gemma] I think 33 is pretty good for you. Scientifically. [Emma] Gemma, what did you get? [sighs] Eighty-nine. And that's without all this. So dumb. You are so stunning. That's insanity. [Gemma slurps, gulps] Whatever. I'm going to a bris. [sighs] Night, ladies. [door opens, closes] [Lissy] No shoes in the apartment! God, that outfit is hideous. You're not gonna believe what happened today. [Lissy] What? You remember that guy, the guy from the plane? The one you spilled your guts to? Mm-hm. He showed up at work today. -Like, stalking you? -[Emma] No. He's the top guy at the company. -Oh, no. -Yeah. [Lissy] Wait, I thought that guy died? Mm-mm. No, that's the other guy. But this guy fell apart after Pete died. -Hmm. -[Emma] They were like brothers. Anyway, I told him all of my secrets. Like, I told him everything about me. I told him about... the begonia. -[groans] -And I told him about Danny Nussbaum. He lasted for 17 seconds. -I counted. -Oh. [chuckling] Oh, my god. So, what? He knows a few things about you. So, what? You don't have any secrets from me though, do you? I had a sex dream about my best friend and roommate Lissy. It's like, in there, now. [clicks tongue, blows air] No. Of course not. So when are you gonna move in with Connor? [Emma] Um... [sighs] I don't know. He's still in his pantsless phase? He is still. -Hmm. -Connor's great. [inhales deeply] Thing's like, thing's aren't... They're... they're not that romantic anymore. I think that's normal for things to kind of slow down, and... fade out a little like that. But that doesn't mean you can't spice it up. How? What about doing it at work? With him? Like, Connor would... I don't... It was just a suggestion. I don't know. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] Oh, hello again. -Oh, sorry. -[Emma] Sorry. -[Jack chuckles] -[Jack and Emma] Okay. -I'm gonna... -Yeah, okay. Thanks. [Cybill] Everyone. Jack will be observing what we do, see how we operate as a team. And before I forget, thank you, team... for coming out to last week's family picnic. It truly meant the world to me. And it was an incredible opportunity for us to meet each other's families and to have what I like to call, good old-fashioned fun. [in soft voice] Don't fucking embarrass me. Uh, you can just ignore me. [Jack] Really. I'm not here. Hi! Yes, this is Artemis Harrington in marketing. [Artemis] Uh-huh. Um... [snaps fingers] Emma? Can you get me the, uh, Costco brochure, please? [Artemis] Faster. [Artemis taps pen] [Artemis] My assistant's coming now. I can't, I can't reach that. [Artemis] Okay, just one second. Yeah. I still can't reach it. -[grunts] -[clatters] [Artemis] Thank you so much. That's my girl! Don't know what we would do without her. -[Artemis] I will have this... -[sighs] sent over to you right away. -[Artemis] Au revoir. -[clears throat] Um, is it always this quiet? [Jack] You know, when Pete and I were starting out, we talked about everything. Um, yeah, what we were watching, what we were listening to, -what we were reading. -Oh! [Jack] Yeah? I am devouring a biography on Queen Mary I of England. Also known as Bloody Mary -Wow. -[Artemis] Yeah. She was, she was a feisty one. [thuds] I'm in the middle of a history of 14th century tapestries. -Nice! -It's, uh... invigorating. -Uh, what about you, Emma? -[gasps] Weren't you reading Great Expectations... in your little "book club"? I could not get through it. I could not get through it. So I just skimmed the back cover. [snickers] Mm-hm. What, uh, what do you think? [clicks tongue] You know I, I actually, it really resonated with me. [Jack] Which part exactly resonated? Um, the resonances. The resonances resonated. I'm gonna, I have to get back to work. -Yeah. No, please. -[Emma] I'm really busy. -[Jack] Yeah. Okay. -[Artemis] Hmm. [Casey] Sir. [chuckles] Too bad. Uh, Casey, Mr. Harper. Uh, um... [sighs] [Casey] I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. Just a fly on the wall. -Uh-huh. -[Jack] Proceed. -Okay. -[Emma] Don't. Don't proceed. Uh... -[mouthing] -[Casey] I just... I, I just came to ask Emma if she wanted to go over some numbers with me. Casey comes and he asks if I wanna go over the numbers, but what he really means is, "Can we go sneak out and get some coffee." I'm so busy right now. I'm really, um... This is a two-person number job. I can't do it on my own, so... -[Emma] Uh... -Come on. Last time I, sort of, I was, like, a hindrance. No, you're the go, you're like a human calculator. -[Emma] Casey, just... -It's what you are. That's, I think you should get started on that. I, I, I think you should go over the numbers. You think he knew? Harper? About our little system? He's, uh, he's handsome. Hm? Yeah, he's like, boy-band handsome. He's tall, he's rich. -I hate him. -[elevator dings] -[Casey] Jesus, Mr. Harper. -[Emma coughs] Uh, sir. [clears throat] Uh, how are those numbers working out? I, uh, I don't want that one. Okay, I'll take it. Um, you know, that's... Uh, I'm gonna take the stairs, so I can... [chuckles] [Jack] Come on in. [elevator dings] [whirring] You know, when we were starting out, Pete and I, we, uh, we had a code. One of us would ask the other to bring him the Leopold file. -The Leopold file? -Yeah. Didn't exist. It was just a... An excuse to get away from our desk. [elevator dings, whirs] -Hey. -[Connor gasps] [Connor] Mr. Harper. Hi. I, I, I'm Jack Harper. Jack, uh, you're Jack Harper. I'm Connor Martin. Market research. -Oh, yeah. -[chuckles] I, uh, I'm on my way to your presentation. Oh, oh. I am so excited. [Jack] Well, uh, I can't wait. [panting] [exhales] Oh, you two are an item. Correct? Oh. [both] Yes. Do you just sense... sense this stuff, or... [Jack] No, no, no. Um... Have you ever found Emma's presence here distracting? Oh, no. No, sir. I, I promise that when Emma and I are at work, she, she... we are nothing. [Connor] We are nothing. [stammers] We might as well be two eunuchs. -[Connor] Take our parts... -Uh-huh. Put them in separate drawers. Leave them until 5:00 p.m. [smacks lips] [Jack] Great. [sighs] Okay. Uh... [Jack] Emma, why don't you join us? [Connor] Okay, thank you so much for joining me today for my presentation on the evolving demographics of Panda Bites. As you know, Panda Bites has been doing... Badly. Very badly. But we are hoping to maybe turn that around with, uh, some of the data that we have gathered. So, the first thing that you should know, is that we have discovered that our target demographic is... [clicks] Millennials! [groans] [Connor] Let's look at a typical millennial. [rasps] [Cybill groans] [indistinct chatter] Oh, he's got to... I wish I was in bed. [Connor] Suspenders... -[Connor] Yes. -[yawns] [clears throat] [Connor] A guitar case. 'Cause he's in a band. His shirt has a pattern. Okay, thank you so much. I think we get the picture. Um, so this is a millennial. We, uh, interviewed 1,000 of them form all across the country. And we asked them about various aspects of Panda Bites. [Connor] What we learned is that our, our target demo is 18 to 35. Uh, they drink Panda Prime four times a day, they eat organic when it's available, they go out to restaurants on the weekends. When they ride on the train, they try to avoid making eye contact with people. Most of them would have bought tickets to the Fyre Festival, and most of them would've been very upset when they found out that the Fyre Festival wasn't actually something. [Cybill clears throat] Are you... Wrap it up! [chuckles] [laughing] That's basically what we know about the demographic of the, uh, millennial. Uh, we're looking forward to, uh, investing more resources and trying to get them to eat Panda Bites. Does anyone, um, have anything to say about this? I, actually, um. Corrigan, then, great. My grandpa and his friends are obsessed with Panda Bites. They eat them, like, three times a day. Um, so I thought, I don't know, maybe we could ask them why. Maybe there's something there that's not being accurately... portrayed in all of the data. But your grandpa is not our target demographic. [Connor] I mean, does this guy look like a grandpa? -[Artemis] Yes. -[Connor] No, look. I think what Connor is trying to say, is that Panda Bites isn't performing. So we need to axe that. If we are going to maximize concept innovation, -then we need to focus.. -[clears throat] on strategic competencies. -Could you, um... -[Artemis] Yes. -Could you say that again. -[Artemis] Absolutely, sir. -Um... -Not like a Harvard Professor. -[spits] -[Emma chuckles] From a, a strategic... Without using the word "strategic". Uh, we should focus on... what we do... Good. Well. [Artemis] Great. Like... Yes. Perfect. I don't mean to single you out, and I appreciate what you're doing, all of you. It's a lot. But Pete used to say, "Sometimes, you just gotta kiss. Keep it simple, stupid." [all chuckling] That's what I would like us to do as a company. [Connor] I thought you were saying, "We should kiss." -Thank you so much. -No. [Connor] Thank you very much. [Jack] Ladies, thank you for your input. Appreciate it. So, uh... -[taps] -Artiste. It's actually pretty good. Is he the one? I know what you're thinking and you're wrong. -You sure? -[Emma] Yes. Are, are you convincing me or yourself? [sighs] [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music] [tapping] [dings] -[thuds] -Ow. Hey, there. [sighs] [Connor] What? Why are you standing like that? I want you to look at my body. Do you have like a rash or something, or... No, I don't have... I wanna look attractive for you. I, I thought there was some emergency. There is. [panting] Hey. We never make love spontaneously anymore. [both] Mmm! When did, when did we ever? -[Connor] Oh, my gosh! -[Emma moaning] -[Connor moaning] -Come on! Make love to me, right here, right now. Are you crazy? No! -No, Emma! -Well, maybe I am crazy! Like... Isn't love supposed to make you a little bit crazy? Uh, like, you know, take off on a Thursday crazy! Not, not this! -Emma, Emma, Emma, stop. Stop. -What? I'm so sorry, I didn't... [Connor] Yeah. Let's just not talk about it. I just... [sighs] I was just trying to get the spark back. What, what, what spark? [sighs] Oh, my god. I've been so stupid. Yeah. You think? -Sex in the archive room? -Connor, this isn't working out. What did you expect? No. Not this, just everything. This, us. I don't think we're, we're working. You're joking, right? [sighs] Are you breaking up with me? [Emma] Yeah. Because, because I, I wouldn't have sex with you in the archive room? No, that's not why. It's a bunch of reasons. I'm everything a woman could want. I listen. I perform cunnilingus. I opened up your world to jazz. -[Connor] I'm a catch, okay? -I know, yeah. I'm really sorry. Two, two, two seconds ago... my, my wiener was out in my place of business. -Well, I don't know... -And now you don't wanna be -with me. -You put your ass out everywhere else, I don't know what the big deal about doing it -in the empty archive room. -No. No! I put my ass out in my home, at the gym, at the doctor's, and at a certain yoga class that I take that is very specific, welcoming, and supportive. That's too many places, Connor! -[door opens, closes] -[sighs] ♪ You only call me If you would have acted like the perfect couple for long enough, you would've become the perfect couple. Yeah. But we wouldn't have been happy. You would've been the perfect couple. That is happy. Everyone pretends in a relationship. Well, maybe they shouldn't. Are you joking? Being honest is so overrated. My parents have been married over 30 years and my dad still thinks my mom is a natural blonde. And she's Asian. That's so sad. Not that she's Asian. Relationships should be based on truth. -Yeah. -And trust. [sighs] I give up. [gulps] I'm going to a baby shower. [groans] [laughs] [upbeat music] I really can't believe it, but it turns out that those wrestlers, they're actors, and that they're not actually fighting each other. -Uh-huh. -Yeah, I'd been watching it -for years at that point. -[Emma] Hey, Nick! -Yeah? -[Emma] Hey, um... Hi. Hi. Um... Panda Bites is your account, right? Till they get the boot. Right, well until then, can I just have, like, a tiny little bit of the marketing budget to put a two-for-one ad in a magazine? Where? Um... [smacks lips] ... Bowling Monthly. -[Emma] I have a theory to test. -[sighs] Look, I think that we've been targeting the wrong demo. Like, I'm telling you, my grandpa and his friends, they're obsessed with Panda Bites. [scoffs, snickers] Somebody's obsessed with their grandpa. [snickers] I'm going. Nick, please. [inhales sharply] I don't know. I won't tell anyone what happened at Chuck's retirement party. [Nick gasps] Uh... [clicks tongue] Fine. Thank you. Thank you so much. -[Nick] Uh-huh. -Thank you. [Cybill] Corrigan! Jack Harper's assistant called, wants you to bring the Leopold file to his office. [sighs] Uh, yeah, guys, I'm gonna say that you're way off base on this one. [Paul] Jan, I'm gonna go and hand this over to you. -[Jan] Okay. -[Jack] Thank you. -Hey, uh, come in. -Yeah. What does this look like to you? [inhales heavily] [Emma] That. -Mm-hm. -[smacks lips] Panda and a... cockroach? It's actually... ovaries with some panda eyes. -[Jack] So, yeah. -Okay. Would you buy this... if it was on a product of some kind? Is it a product for my ovaries? No, it's not. [inhales deeply] No. No. That's the right answer. That's the right answer, yeah. It's terrible. -Anyway. Hi. -Hi. Um, I brought you the, the Leopold file. You made an actual Leopold file. Yeah. Well, I didn't want... if I dropped it, I didn't want anyone to see that there was nothing in there. -[Emma] So... -[chuckles] "From the office of Ernest P. Leopold. Six thousand cases of Panda Prime." Wow, that's, that's quite the customer. That's right. "May I add that I am delighted with all aspects of your company, and have taken to starting my day with a bowl of Panda Pebbles. Which is the best cereal I've ever had." Yep. Wow. This is... [chuckles] This is amazing. Pete would've, he would've loved this. -Thank you. -[Emma] Of course. Um, do you wanna, do you wanna sit down? Okay. [chuckles] [Jack] So, um... Um... I, I heard you and Connor broke up. Uh... [chuckles] -I'm sorry. Are, are you okay? -[Emma] Yeah. I'm fine. I think, you know, it's for the best. It'll be good to be single. [in soft voice] Freedom. -Right. -[Emma] Mm-hm. Right. Yeah, um... Yeah. Sure, okay. Um, well, I guess... Maybe now is not the... best time to ask, um... What? Well, I was, I was, I was wondering if you... wanted to, um... [smacks lips] Uh... -I, I was gonna ask you... -Date? -Uh... -[Jack] I was gonna say dinner. But sure, yeah, uh... Would you, would you want to? Yeah, sure. How's tonight? Okay. [chuckles] All right, um, okay. -Great. -Great. -Great. -Thank you so much. [Emma chuckles] Okay. -Okay. -Uh... Goodbye. [chuckles] [Emma] Lissy? -Huh? -Lissy, please? -No. I said no! -Please. Please, I need to impress him. I can't think of anything else. [in muffled voice] The key... "The key shall not be transferred to any non-member under any circumstances." Please. I will owe you big time, like, I will love you forever, -and I will cook you dinner -Okay. -for two years. -Stop. Just stop. -It's making me grind more. -[Emma] Thank you. -Don't lose it. -I love you. Thank you. I won't. I won't, and I'm gonna do the same thing for you when I'm the member of an exclusive club. -[Emma] I promise. -Thank you. That's where it was the whole time? In the cork bowl? [Lissy] Yeah, right under our noses. That's it? Why is it so small? [Lissy] I don't know. Just show it at the door. Wait, do you remember the password? -Blake. -Chad. Chad! Of course, I knew it was like a douchey name. [doorbell buzzing] Is that him? [dogs barking] [wings flapping] -Hey. -Hey. Sorry, I know I'm early, I just, I, I hate being late, and I didn't know... traffic. I do that all the time, too. -[Jack] Really? -Yeah. [Emma] Anyway, I'm not totally ready. Do you wanna wait here and then... Oh, um, I can just wait, I can just wait with you. -Yeah. -[Jack] If that's okay? Yeah, sure. Yeah, totally. -[Jack] Okay. -Come on in, please. [Jack] After you. [Emma] Hey. Um, so this is my, um, roommate and best friend, Lissy. -[Jack] Hi. -That's Toots. -Jack. -Lissy. [Jack] Nice to meet you. Oh, hey, Toots. Oh, uh, roommate? I've, uh, heard a lot about you. -[Lissy] Have you? -[Jack] Yes. Did you know that I grind my teeth? -[Jack chuckles] -No, it's a genetic condition. -So that's why I've... -Oh. -I didn't expect you to... -Oh, no. It's okay. -[Jack] It's nice to meet you. -[Lissy] Yeah, I mean... Thank you. Yeah. You too. So this is your world, huh? Yeah. "Beacon's closet." [Jack] Oh, cool. [chuckles] Wow. It's, uh, bright. [chuckles] [snickers] [Jack] That is the happiest dog I think I've ever seen. -[Emma] Right? -Is he actually smiling? Yeah! -Dogs smile. -Oh. -"Adopt, don't shop." -That one does. [Emma chuckles] -[Jack] Wow. -[cell phone ringing] [Jack] Sorry about that. -Putting it on do not disturb. -[cell phone ringing stops] There, for emergencies only. All right, well, I'm ready. If you're ready. -[Jack] Yeah. -Okay, great. -[Jack] Let's go. -[Emma] Great. [Jack] Bye, Toots. Bye, guys. I know your itinerary. [door closes] [light music] -[cars honking] -[Jack chuckles] [Emma] Yeah, it's just, you know, weird street. -[Jack chuckles] -[Emma clears throat] [Jack] All right, well, an evening out, Emma-style. What does this, I mean, what does this look like? Well, I thought we could be spontaneous, -you know. -Oh, yeah. [knocking on door] Hmm? -Hi. Hi. -Hm. [man grumbles] Um, is, uh, can I talk to Chad? Um, Chad? Chad. Uh, the key. I know it's small. Um, but, can... is Chad to come in? Chad? -Is it? -[clangs] Uh, are you sure this is the right address? Hold on, I'm, it's... This is... Just... I'm just gonna ask. -[spits] -Yeah. [man snickers] [retches] Hi. [retches, coughs] I was just, has this got a bar? This, do you know if there's a bar nearby? You want a drink? -Lose deputy dipshit... -You know what, -I think we're good. -Thank you, no. I think... -I'm sorry. Thank you so much. -Thank you. Maybe we'll come back. I could have sworn it was here. It's like this really cool club, it's so cool. And like, tons of celebrities go there, and it's just like... I thought this was where it was. [chuckles softly] Um, okay. Well, do you want me to call a car? No, no, no. Don't. It's, I mean... -All right. Um... -We'll find it. [sighs] Somehow. [chuckles] Are you hungry? -I'm starving. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Do you like falafel? [light music] [Emma] Mmm. -[Jack] Oh. -[Emma groans] -[Jack] Oh. Oh. -[Emma] Oh, my god. [Jack chuckles] [in muffled voice] Are you kidding me? Here. I don't, I'm... I wanna be helpful. [both chuckle] -Well, here, I, uh... -I'm abandoning it. [Jack] I don't blame you. God, I haven't been here in so long. Pete used to drag me out this way a lot. I guess since he's passed, I, um... But... It's nice to be here again. And for a night that... didn't go according to plan. -[chuckles] -[Jack] It went sort of, wrong. Yeah. [chuckles] [Jack] This is, uh... -So embarrassing. -[Jack] No. No. It's, uh... No, it's perfect. Hm. [cell phone ringing] [Jack chuckles] [Emma] It's okay. -[cell phone ringing continues] -Sorry. Hello. What do we do? Plan B? Back to Chicago? Yeah. Bye. Is everything all right? It's just complicated. [Emma] Well, maybe I can help. Like, I'm really, really good at giving advice. Like, I'm way better at giving advice than taking advice. [Jack chuckles] Yeah, I just, like... I can't. [sighs deeply] [Emma] I understand if you have to leave. No. Like, I wanted to... I wanted to spend an evening with you, and... and that's what I'm doing. [romantic music] [Emma gasps] You could have any woman. Yeah, but I want you. [both chuckle] -That was so douchey! -[Emma] No! [Jack] What I meant to say... [chuckles] Is... Maybe you're not the only one looking for an earthquake. [gasps] How do you remember that? I mean, you remember everything that I said on the plane. Like, why would someone like you be interested in my... boring little life? Emma, you, you are anything but boring. Ever since you started talking on that plane... I was gripped. You were gripped? I was gripped. [gasps] [both chuckle] [upbeat music] [Emma and Jack chuckle] [smooches] [both panting] -Oh, shit. -What? What? Rock-hard abs. [both chuckle] [Emma] Okay. I don't... -I don't know any tricks. -What? Like, I know you've had sex with millions of, of, like, supermodels and, like... and like, models, and... and, and gymnasts, and... -like, I don't know any tricks. -Okay. [Jack] Yeah, I don't know any tricks, either. -Okay. -Maybe one. [both panting] [Emma] That was a hell of a trick. [Emma chuckles] You're, like, the most successful person that I have ever met in real life. And you're like so... hot and, and handsome, and charming. And you have rock-hard abs. Okay. Okay. -It's ridiculous. -[laughs] -Like you were made in a lab. -Mm-mm. [chuckling] What? And I'm just entirely flawed. That's not true. And I am not flawless, I promise you. -Yes, you are. -I am not. Name one defect. One blemish. You have none. Okay. Well, um... -Actually, no, um... -What? Um... -What? -Okay. Okay, fine. I'm, I'm gonna tell you something but, it... You have to promise you will not tell anybody. Okay. I... I have syndactyly. What? It's... -only sometimes contagious. -What? I'm kidding. It's a, it's a joke. -It's a... -What is that? -It's just... it's a joke. -What is that? It's... okay. Calm down. Calm down. -I'm calm. -Just, just... You can't just spring something like that on me. Just, just... -Just look. -What? -[Emma] What are we looking at? -[Jack] My foot. -[Emma] Oh, thank god. -[Jack chuckles] [Emma] That's skinflactly? [snickers] No, it's syndactyly. It's, uh, it's, it's not a webbed feet situation. It's like a two-headed toe. [Jack] Look at it, it's not... -it's just, it's one... -[Emma] You have webbed feet! It's one toe. -Well, it's two toes... -Jack Harper -has webbed feet! -...but it's one toe. No, I don't! I have, oh, my god. Have I... -Jack Harper is deformed. -You, shush. -Jack Harper is hideous. -No. Jack Harper is a hideous beast. It's all been a lie. [both chuckling] [light music] [Emma] He is everything that I didn't have with Connor. He's interested in me. It's amazing. That's hideous. [Gemma] Okay, dating 101. Never let a man know your feelings. Didn't your mom teach you anything? Well, it's too late. He already knows absolutely everything. Okay, well, he'll never respect you. [Lissy] Oh, sure, he will. -[camera shutter clicks] -I'm trying to get the shot. -Trying to get the shot. -Well... I'm trying to give her this sherry. [Gemma] This is a disaster. -Unless... -What? You use it to get that promotion. What? Are you kidding me? I would never do that. [groans] I'm washing my hands of this. I have to go meet my grandma for dinner. Oh, and don't even think about borrowing any of my clothes. [camera shutter clicks] [scoffs] [upbeat music] -[Emma] Hi! -[Jack] Hi! -Come on. -Yeah. -Oh! Oh my god, are you okay? -Oh! Thank you! Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs] -You're taller than usual. -Yeah. [Jack]Okay, okay, so then what? [Emma] So then, I went around to the side of the house... and I ate the entire thing. [moaning] [pops] -Oh, Jesus. -Oh, wow. -[chuckling] -How's this fucking thing work? [laughing] -Cheers. -Cheers. Oh! Oh, my god. [smooches] [gulping] So how did you and Pete Laddler start Panda? -[cell phone ringing] -Um, I'm so sorry. [cell phone ringing] ♪ Sometimes I wanna give up On this love ♪ ♪ But then you call And come around ♪ [Emma] Oh, I like this one! "You'll gain new insights this week." -Huh. -I like that. ♪ I feel your love ♪ Sometimes I wanna give up On it all ♪ Oh, here's one for you. [Emma] "You will learn to share yourself with others." Mmm. Hmm. [keypad clacking] [Emma] When I was growing up, I took it for granted that I would always love myself. But sometimes, I feel like... [sighs] [inhales sharply] Like I haven't done enough to deserve it. [whispers] And that's really scary. [smooches] [sobbing] I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm crying. [smooches] -It's okay. -[Emma chuckles] [Emma sniffles] I don't know why I told you that. Hey. Hey. You deserve it. [Emma chuckles] Lissy! I'm in love! [chuckles] [upbeat music playing over radio] [Omar grunting] Lissy? Are you here? [Omar grunting] [Omar groaning] [Lissy groaning] [Lissy grunting] [orchestral music playing over radio] Lissy? -[door opens] -[Omar moaning] [Lissy] Ouch! Ahh! Oh, my god. [gasps] Oh, my god. [Lissy groaning] [panting] [Lissy] No! No, no, no. [Lissy] Emma! [sighs heavily] [Lissy] Emma. Open up. [door creaking] [Emma] I'm really sorry. -We weren't having sex. -[Emma] Okay. -No, we weren't. -[Emma] Sure. No. I'd... We were dancing. [Emma] What? [chuckles] What are you wearing? What do you mean? Why, this is what dancers wear. I am in this group, um... [clicks tongue] Just a bunch of lawyers, uh, got together, -and we formed a dance group. -Dancing lawyers? Yeah. And one judge. That's great. I don't know why you didn't tell me that. -'Cause you would laugh? -[Emma] No. [both chuckle] Well, I'm really relieved I didn't see you having sex. Yeah, me too. But it's also really a shame... 'cause I thought we were both having sweaty, passionate, marathon sex. What? Twice last night... and once this morning. And I'm in love with him. -I love him. -[Lissy] Wow. Whoa. Has he told you anything about himself? No. Why are you lawyering me? -Stop. -[Lissy] Okay. I'm just curious whether he's sharing himself with you. Look, I know that he's like a really private person, but I think he's gonna start opening up, because... I opened up first. Men and women, they should just be honest with each other right from the start. Like, all of this being aloof... and mysterious stuff. It's total bullshit. Everyone should just tell their secrets to each other right away. -Okay? -Toots knows. [Toots softly growling] [inhales sharply] [Emma] Right, Toots? [calm music] [Emma] Oh. [chuckles] [Cybill] People. Jack Harper's about to do an interview, and we're all going to watch from the conference room. Now. [sighs sharply] [interviewer] I'm joined by Jack Harper, who founded Panda Prime with Pete Laddler in 2010. Those guys were just 25 when the company went public, and Pete was always... The outgoing type. But you were the man behind the scenes, but no more, my friend. Tell me, how did things change after he died? Um... Uh, it was, it was really tough... uh, for all of us. We... We used to do this together. Um, but I'm, I'm enjoying work again. I'm... finding new inspiration. [interviewer] You've taken the organic energy food market by storm. And now I hear you're looking to get into women's health. Well, we, we plan on a full line of products. Um, starting with some amazing supplements. [Jack] We wanna continue our mission of getting affordable, organic products into the mainstream. All right. Who's your target market? Just the girl on the street. [interviewer] How can Panda tap in to that... girl on the street? Well, uh... what we would like to think, and I like to think, I know something about that girl. Go on. Um, you know, we're surrounded these days by these... perfect and polished and airbrushed images and ideas of women. [Jack] But this girl, she's um... She's real. She hates high heels. She'd rather go barefoot. You know, she, she chews her gum without shame. [Jack] She's not afraid to drink wine out of the bottle. She likes clothes, but she's not fashion-forward. Maybe she wears a pair of jeans with a flower in her hair. She reads a dozen horoscopes and then chooses which one to believe. She loves animals, especially the ones that no one else wants. Oh, my god. It's Emma. [Jack] She loves Abba, but she hates jazz. -[indistinct chatter] -[woman 2 snickers] [Jack] She scans the backs of classics... and then pretend that she's read them. I knew you had never read Great Expectations. [scoffs] She cries every time that she hears "Demons" by Imagine Dragons. -[laughing] -[Artemis] Oh, wow. [Jack] She sleeps with a My Little Ponybedspread. -[laughing] -Oh, my god. [Jack]She has fears and worries and deep insecurities. [Nick laughing] And she doesn't feel like she deserves love. -[coworkers laughing] -[gasps] [coworkers laughing] I'm sorry. I, uh... [chuckles] I got carried away. We can edit some of that out, right? We're live, so... nope. Jack Harper, thank you for joining us. Are you screwing Jack Harper?

[groans] [sobbing] I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. [sniffles] I've never been so humiliated. [whimpering] Everyone was laughing at me. [Gemma] What did I say? Never let a man know anything about you. [Emma] I know. [sobs] You were right. I just should have kept my mouth shut, and none of this would have happened. [cell phone buzzing] Oh, my god. It's him. Don't pick up. No. Answer it. Otherwise, he'll think he won. [sniffles] [sobbing] I don't ever want to talk to you, or see you, or hear you. -[Emma] Or... -Taste you. Or touch you, ever again. Yes, bitch, step into your power. -[sobbing] -All right. Now... it's time to get even. I don't know. I don't... Come on, Emma, just do, do something like, um... key his car, or shred his suits, or something just a, a little something to just, like, send him a message. You know, instill that fear in him. If you wanna get back at him... just reveal his secrets. That's, that's actually a really good idea. I don't know any of his secrets. You don't know any of them? Lissy was right. Our relationship was completely one-sided. Like, he knew everything about me, and I knew nothing about him. -Nothing at all? -No. He, he has like... he has skindylactfootly. What? Skindactfully. [Emma] It's like webbed feet. Like, two toes fused together. Oh, yeah. I get it. I get it. But it's, he still has his toes, they're just like... -Yeah, I, it's not right. -It's like a hoof? Yeah, kind of like a hoof. -[Emma] Sorta. -It's a, it's a deformity. -You can't make fun of that. -But it's fine, -because you just wear socks -Mm-hm. -Like a special sock? -[Emma] No, no. Okay, well, anything else? Nothing? What? He was in Chicago. Chicago. Okay. He didn't want me to tell anyone. And he was like very, very adamant that I not tell anyone. And I overheard him say something about, like, um, a Plan B. Wait, that's, that's it? Chicago? Plan B? Yeah. Okay. Not exactly a kill shot. [sighs] [sobbing] [gloomy music] [coworkers laughter echoing] [Casey] I'm so sorry. Things are just so... [background chatter] [sighs] You okay? I mean, if I had gone through what you went through, with everyone... seeing and knowing all that, I would... just wither away to my death. I would literally figure out a way to make a time machine, so I could go back in time. But like, not our time, like, my ancestor's time, so I could just wipe out my whole lineage. [blows air] Done. You know? Yeah. Yeah, I, I... -I mean... -[door closes] -Ditto. -[Jack] Emma. Oh, my god. -[Jack] Uh, Emma? -No. Don't look at him. Don't look... Just look at me. Just pretend -that he's not here. -Oh. -He's right there. -[Emma] No. Look at me. Don't. Just pretend. [Jack] Can we talk? No. There is nothing to talk about. [Jack] I just wanna try to explain. -What? How you betrayed her? -Casey. Casey, just... -[Emma] Casey. -[sighs heavily] -I'm sorry for yelling at you. -[Emma] Hey, Casey. Mr. Harper, my boss. [clears throat] I'm gonna... I'm gonna go. -No, no, no. -[Emma] No. Get... -Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. -Just... Look, hey. You got this. If you hurt her, I'll kill you. Sir. [snickers] [door opens] -[door closes] -[Emma sighs] [Jack] Emma. Emma. I am so sorry. [Emma] Everyone was laughing at me. You, you humiliated me. I know, I know. They, they, they asked me that question, they caught me off guard and I, and I, I panicked. [Emma] You broke your promise. You told me that you would die with my secrets. I fucked up. I am so sorry. [Emma] Do you have any idea how violated I felt? Is it, is it really that bad for people to know the truth about you? [scoffs] Are you kidding me? You haven't told me anything about you. You think that your secrets are more important than mine. No. That's not true. Then why don't you tell me what you were doing in Chicago? Why don't you tell me what you were answering all those phone calls for? [sighs] Look, it's really hard for me to trust people. Okay? I've been burned a lot. Look, I get that. But I can't be the only one who's being vulnerable in this. [Emma sniffles] [sighs] Goodbye, Jack. [Emma sobbing] [door opens, closes] [Emma] I saw Jack. Oh, tell me you didn't go to him. No. He came to me to apologize. What did he say? He said that he fucked up, that he thinks his secrets are more important than mine. -Oh, hell no! -[Gemma scoffs] Okay, well, if they're so important, then you gotta find out what they are and expose them. I don't know what he's hiding. Maybe he's with another woman. What? [Emma] Really? Do you think he's with another woman? No, no. I don't... I don't know. I don't know. No. What else would he be hiding? It doesn't matter whether he is, or he's not. No. It does matter. And you need to get revenge. [Gemma] He needs to pay. I know a guy. [exhales sharply] What? Are you gonna have him whacked? [Gemma] No. He's a tabloid reporter I hooked up with on Tinder. I'll take care of it, you know. [whispering] She's crazy. I can't just tree-stand here and watch you suffer. I don't want revenge. I just want closure. That's just another fancy word for revenge. No, it's a different word entirely. [sighs] [cell phone ringing] [indistinct chatter] [Cybill] You need to have that ready for launch and do three copies. Good. [Artemis] Well, look who's here. -[Cybill] Nick. -[Nick] Yeah, boss? Can you explain to me why, for the love of god, you would put a coupon ad for Panda Bites... in Bowling Monthly Magazine? [Nick clicks tongue, sighs] It was actually, uh... Well, I have the numbers. And despite the shit-show circulation, they're off the charts. [Nick] Oh. Well, that's great. Good job. -It was a bit of a gamble. -[Cybill] Okay. But, um... I thought it was time to experiment with the new... -Demographic. -Smart. Excellent. Well, it paid off. Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. No, I'm not sorry. That was my idea. That was entirely my idea, Nick. Well, uh, we may have... discussed it, but you, you know, marketing is all about teamwork. -We're sitting here as a team. -It's not. It wasn't teamwork. [Emma] You were gonna axe Panda Bites. I told you I knew we were just marketing to the wrong demo. Because everything is marketed to millennials. You make something cool for the older crowd, they're gonna show up for it. Not bad, Corrigan. Thank you. -Nick. -[Nick] Yeah. [Cybill] Don't you ever pass off someone else's idea as your own again. All right. -Anything else? -So can I have my promotion? [Artemis] What? You told me that I could have a promotion if I made my own opportunities, and I think that I did that here. And I have put everything into this job. And I think that I've proven myself now, and I think that I deserve a promotion. Fair enough. All righty. Meeting done. Well, I guess that's what happens when you sleep with the boss. Corrigan. We need to talk. Okay. Hi. I know Jack Harper to be a decent man. [Cybill] I have one thing to ask you, Corrigan. -Was it your choice? -[Emma] Yes. When I met him, I didn't even know he worked here. Okay. [inhales sharply] I think it's important that... that you know that as a woman, you have to work twice as hard as everyone else to be taken seriously. And this is gonna make it that much harder, because everyone's going to assume that everything you get is because you slept with the boss. But you earned it. -[Cybill] Okay? -Yes. [sighs] Don't tell anyone I did that. [chuckles] Okay. [sighs] -[Emma] I got the promotion. -[Casey] See? That's great news. [whirring] [Connor sighs] [elevator dings] [clears throat] [Connor] So, Emma... I need to ask you a question. -Sure. -It's a sex question. Oh. [Connor] Were you always honest with me in that department? Oh, kill me now, God. [Emma] Connor, I'm, I'm... Please, I wanna learn from my mistakes. Oh, my god. [sighs] Okay, um... There was that one, like... that one thing that you did with your tongue, like the slidy thing. The slide down or the slide in? The slide, it's both. [Emma] It's a little bit not in the right... spot. [Connor] You show me what it should look like. What I would imagine, I think, -you find the right spot. -Right. And then... Okay. -[Emma] You can also, like that. -[Connor] Oh, with the fingers? And then, yeah, yeah. You find the clitoris. Yeah, but not... -Oh, not the side to side? -Not that. -Oh, I thought it was fun. -It's bizarre and then you miss the spot. -[Casey] Are we stuck? -[elevator dings] Well, Emma, I fully believe that you deserve happiness, and I hope that Jack is as generous a lover as I was. [Connor scoffs] [light music] [Omar] Yeah, you know the clause four sets. Yeah. I wrote clause four. [grunting] [Omar] Dude, dude, that's clause eight. [Emma] Lissy! [Omar] Come on, man... My god. You look amazing. So beautiful! Thanks. Where's your outfit? It's backstage. [sighs] I can't do this. -What? -[Lissy] I can't do this. I don't wanna do this. I don't... I'm, I'm way too nervous. -No, everyone feels that way. -[Lissy] I don't wanna do this. I feel bad. I feel like I'm gonna throw up and shit, and like... It's totally normal. [Emma] Here, look. Look at the dancing judge. Look, if he can do it, then you can do it. -He's really good. -[Emma] Yeah. He is. And so are you. You can do this. Trust me, you can do this. -[Lissy] Okay. -Okay? [Lissy groans] -[Lissy] I love you. -I love you. [pants] [Jack] Emma. What are you doing here? [Jack] I, um... I saw the flyer you put up at the office. Look, I came here to tell you that you were right. I should have shared a lot more with you. [Jack] I was in Chicago... because I was visiting someone. -A girl. -A woman. [Jack] No. No. It's... It's actually... Um, a little girl. Her name's Alice. She's, um. She's four years old. You have a daughter? No. Um... She's my goddaughter. She was Pete's. [Jack] Um... [Emma chuckles softly] She's cute. [Jack] Yeah. I didn't know that he had a daughter. Yeah, um, nobody really does. We're trying to keep her out of the spotlight. There was a tabloid snooping around, and I had to kill the story. That's your big secret? [Jack] It doesn't seem like much, but... [sighs] This kid... she means the world to me. And, and I just want her to have a normal life. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you. [Emma] You don't have to be sorry. Look, only a handful of people know about her. A very special... trusted handful. [usher] Ladies and gentlemen, the house is now open. -I should probably... -Yeah. Sit down. Well, thanks. Thanks for keeping this to yourself. I... I know that you knew how important it was to me, so... Yeah, of course. No. It's okay. [chuckles] Hey! Do you wanna maybe... watch a bunch of lawyers find their inner artists? [chuckles] -Yeah. -[Emma] Yeah? Yeah. Sounds good. [orchestral music] Oh, my god, that's Lissy. She's remarkable. [chuckles] [Emma] Lissy. My god, you were so amazing! I had no idea you could dance. Yeah. Hi. -Hi, you were so good. -[Lissy] Um, thanks. Thank you for coming. I mean, I totally messed up, I was definitely... Stop. I wanna hear you say, "I was magical", because you were magical. [sighs deeply] Okay. I was, I was magical. [chuckles] -That's right. -[Lissy exhales] -Thank you for being here. -[Emma] Of course. -Oh. -I wanna take your picture. -You look beautiful. -[groans] [chuckles] -Shit, I left my bag. -[Jack] Oh. Your bag. -I'll, I'll get it. -[Emma] Okay. Are you sure? -Yeah. -[Emma] Okay. Thank you. [Lissy] Thanks. What? He came to talk to me. -[Lissy] Okay. -He came to tell me his secret. -Okay. what is it? -I can't tell you. -[Lissy] Emma. -I'm sorry, I can't. -After all that? -I can't. [Gemma] Emma! This is Mick fromThe Enquirer. If you could just state your name. Okay, can you please leave? There's been like, a huge misunderstanding. -[Gemma] What? -[Mick] Is she Emma Corrigan? Yes. She is Emma Corrigan, and she needs to get back at Jack Harper. -You have to, you have to... -[Mick] Hi. -You have to leave right now. -[Mick] Wait, wait. -Don't talk yet. -[Emma] No, stop. Let me hit record. Just tell me everything -you know about Jack Harper. -[Emma] Please, just go. [Lissy] She doesn't have to tell you anything. America wants to hear this story. Can you go, please? You know, there's a lot of money to be made in this. There's no money to be made, there's no story. Jack Harper needs to learn his lesson. Lissy, please, can you do something? -Guys, just go. -[Lissy] I'm a lawyer. -[Gemma] No, no, no. -[Emma] Go. Just stop. [Jack] Oh. [Mick] Mr. Harper, can you confirm that you were on a flight from Chicago with Miss Corrigan? What's going on? -[Mick] Just wanna get a photo. -She's getting her revenge. -That is what's going on. -[Emma] Stop. No. Jack! -[Mick] Jack, one more question. -Stop it! [Emma] Jack, wait. Wait! So that's why you pressed me on Chicago? No. They don't know anything. -You have to believe me. -Except the one thing I asked you to keep private. -No, Jack. -You wonder why -I don't trust people. -I was hurt and I was angry. Emma, you sold my secret. [Emma] I didn't. I... just... No, Jack. Please. -You have to believe me. -Go finish your interview.

[captain]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to flight 810 with service to Chicago. We have a full flight tonight, so please take your seats as quickly as possible. - Thank you. -[Emma] Hi. Cybill told me you were leaving. I need to tell you something before they send me to my seat. I didn't tell that guy anything. I would never ever, ever do that. In my whole life, I always based my value in myself... off of what other people thought of me. I completely lost sight of who I was. And then I met you. And I told you everything about me. I told you all of my secrets. And, you didn't leave. Even though you knew all of my goofiness, and my weirdness, and all of my... fears and my insecurities. You didn't leave. And I didn't know anything about you. But it didn't matter, because I knew your heart. You made me believe that I could be loved just by being myself. You made me believe that the only way to be loved was by being myself. -And that is amazing. -[woman 3 clears throat] [woman 3] Excuse me. You're in my seat. I'm sorry. [baby babbling] [baby grunting] [cooing] [woman 4 humming] [baby babbling] [baby cooing] [grumbling] [munches] [coos] [Jack] I'm afraid of the dark. Always have been. I, I keep a baseball bat under my bed just in case. I have a fake tooth. I cracked mine trying to open a beer bottle to impress a girl in college. -[Jack sighs] -[baby cooing] I lost my virginity to a girl named Lisa Greenwood... in her uncle's barn. And like a true, true loser, I asked if I could keep her bra as a souvenir. Nice! [snickers] Do you wanna switch seats with me? It's uh, you know, first class. Oh, hell yes. [snickers] -Hold these. -Oh, sure. [thuds] Oh. [snickers] Watch it. [old guy] Thank you. [sighs] I have always wished that I was two inches taller. Usually, when I sit in board meetings, I look around and I think... "Who the hell are these people?" [chuckles] I met a girl... on a plane. And my entire life changed. I'm absolutely... completely in love with her. [sniffles] I got a lot more to tell you. But, not all of it is pretty. Okay. [rumbling] -[Emma] You okay? -Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, um... kind of, really afraid of flying. A lot afraid of flying, yeah. [tranquil music] Just keep talking.
