Hey. Where are we going? Kata forbid. How could you? Night like this, how couldn't I? Don't you feel it? Don't you feel the energy? You mustn't. She disagrees. She's calling. All sorts of vermin be hearing that call too. Nonsense. Not nonsense. What happened to Mel? Smallpox. That wasn't smallpox. Something's out there. That's why Kata... Hush! Those expose the soul. How else can it fly? Silly girl. You call what you are. Oh, fuck! Happy birthday, Sis. Aw! Oh, you didn't have to. Oh, come on. Ah! Mm, mm. Oh, what a day. - You okay? - What? Never mind. Hey! Can you come get me, please? I'm not feeling well. Okay. Sure. See you soon. Hey, babe. How's it goin'? I'm gonna go pick up Delfi. Oh, for Christ's sake. She's not feeling well. Again? She's not gonna take the fuckin' bus? Don't you see what's happening here? Enlighten me. She's dead weight. Fuck. Delfi! Hello? Why didn't you wait for me at the store? Thanks for coming. You okay? You sound a little... Just tired. Gonna stop for some wine and stuff. I've got friends coming over later. I'm tired, Andra. Oh, pep up. A little party is just what you need. Yeah. Hey! Work happening here. Uh, coming. Hi. You look awesome. Thanks. - You doin' better? - Oh, yeah. What was it before? Tony coming? Nah, I'm done with him. Oh, Tony. Poor Tony. You never liked him anyways. Nice job! I don't know how I'm gonna survive this class. Heinz is a nightmare. I'm actually enjoying Heinz's class. - He's such a drag. - No, I love studying Erikson. Erikson's old school. Oh, yeah right! I don't think so. I wrote my dissertation on modern Eriksonian. And I bet you slayed that. Yeah, I'm getting my PhD in the fall. Oh, at Yale I presume? San Serra, actually. - You got in!? - You got it!? Oh, just keep it low key, okay? Andra's going to California! Shh! No, no, I haven't decided yet. Wouldn't take me very long to decide. Oh, California? Like a millisecond. Shh! Don't tell anyone, okay? Ah. Ooh! Okay. Dear, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. "..very limited spots." "Unfortunately..." Where are we going? Kata forbid. How could you? Night like this, how couldn't I? Something's out there. That's why Kata... Hush! You mustn't. She disagrees. She's calling. Delfi, stop! Stop! Delfi, talk to me. Delfi, what the fuck happened? I'm worried about you. This feels like two years ago. Okay, look, I know you've been struggling with something, but you really need to tell me what's going on. I can't. Why? I've been seeing things. Oh, Delfi, not again. Why didn't you tell me it was back? Okay, listen, Delfi. We'll go back to therapy. I know some professors at the college. Great people. All of them. You'll have your pick, okay? We'll get you a new doctor. I have one. Who? Often unresolved issues, pain, fear, regret, manifest as delusions, or hallucinations. If these issues lie in the subconscious, hypnosis can be a window onto them. So, just relax while I set things up. Do you know Forging Mind? He's a digital artist from Australia. Motion art therapy, meditative visuals, stuff like that. Great guy. So, Delfi. I want you to imagine you're a bird... ..flying over the story of your life. You're safe in the air. Nothing can hurt you. You can see all of your past. We are one of a kind! Do you feel safe? Yes. I'm going to ask about your hallucinations now. When did they begin? In the womb. Are they triggered by anything in particular? When it comes. Is "it" something your mind has constructed? No. Where is "it" from then? What is "it"? It is... It's here. Where? Touching my hair. Back! I'm not equipped to deal with these types of things. But I'll refer you to someone else, someone very gifted. Pat Banfi? She's a spiritualist. That was just insane. You're so narrow minded. No, I'm not, but come on. I wanna see this Pat. We're going to a proper doctor. - Give me Pat's number. - No, why? It's just gonna be more of that bullshit. Give me her number! Okay, no, Delfi. You had an episode. You're seeing things. You need proper help. Please, you need medication. And that's okay. Fuck you! Delfi! Hello? Hi, um, Dr. Smith gave me your number. It's great to finally speak to you. It's not about me. It's about my sister. It is about you. Excuse me? I know you're scared, Andra. You should be. How do you know my name? I've been expecting this call. Let me talk you through things. First, just let me know who you are. I know your nights are restless. You're beginning to sense a new reality. One you'll face without Delfi. Is this some little game you set up with Dr. Smith? You've always been the strong one. It makes sense for you to carry the burden now. What do you mean "carry the burden?" My sister is the one who's sick. I'm trying to help her get well. There's little time. You must be prepared for what's coming. This is crazy. I know what's wrong with Delfi, how she can be saved, how you're the only one who can do it. Please, you must listen to me. I'm not listening to anything until you tell me who you are and how you know about me and my sister. A friend. That's all that's important for now. I'm a friend. Let's try another way. It's hard because you've ignored the truth for so long. But now, just between us, admit it. You know she's not sick. Something does haunt her. Maybe a few times. Go on. I'm not even sure what I saw. Or didn't see what it was. I was very young. I'm not even sure. Um, I'm about seven years old playing with Delfi. Did you see? Okay, can you please just tell me what I can do to help my sister? Until you see, it'll keep focus on her. I don't understand. You will soon. - Please! - I'll set a lantern. A lantern? What does that have to do with anything? The lantern will lead you there. You said you were a friend and we need help. Delfi's burden will pass when you see. Maybe we can meet face-to-face. We will meet face-to-face soon enough. But now, you must find the lantern. What? Oh, shit. Delfi? Delfi!? Delfi? Oh, my God! No! Delfi! I'm not here. Delfi! Delfi! Delfi, stay with me. Come on. Come on, Delfi. - Oh! - Shh! - I was trapped. - Mm-hm. - It got me. - It's okay. Okay? Everything is okay. You don't understand. It's gonna keep me forever. And I'll still be alive. Oh, Delfi, you're not making any sense. No, listen! No, listen to me! It's getting closer every night. It's getting closer every night. Last night, tonight. Tomorrow's a full moon. It'll get me for sure. I gotta end it now. Delfi, no! You can't stop me! Under hypnosis you said it was with you in the womb. If that's true, then the connection to you predates your birth and killing yourself won't solve anything! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Shh, shh, shh. - That smell. - What smell? Where did you get this? A friend gave it to me from North Bay. North Bay? North Bay? Yeah. Delfi. I know this place. Oh, Delfi, this looks familiar to me too. You're confusing memories of when we went to camp after Mom and Dad died. No, it was a different time before any of this shit happened to me. I'm telling you I've been there. There's a river with a trail that leads to a forest of birches. I've been there. Okay. North Bay's only a couple hours from here. It's even better than the picture online. Oh, wow. Told you we shoulda come. There's even tea. I know you think I'm crazy. No, Delfi. I don't think you're crazy. - Okay? - Okay. I do think... ♪ That you're losing your freakin' mind ♪ ♪ And I don't know where to turn ♪ ♪ I keep sayin' ♪ ♪ Sayin' I'm fine ♪ ♪ Keep sayin' I'm fine ♪ - Ooh. - ♪ I keep sayin' I'm fine ♪ ♪ time ♪ ♪ Tryin' to get it together but my dreams are so... ♪ "Went walking." Ugh, thanks for waiting. Oh, Andra! I was... Shh! It was a group of us. We were witches. And we had it. We had the power. We had the power, the power of the world. The power? Yeah. Don't you feel it? Don't you feel the energy? Shh! Don't you feel it? Don't you feel the energy? We mustn't. And there was... There was Kata. And she was our leader. Kata. Oh, Kata? Kata! - Kata, wait! - Delfi! - Kata, it's me! - Delfi, enough! - You don't understand! - No, you don't understand. We need to go to the hospital. - I've never felt better! - You're dissociating. You need help now or you could remain delusional. No, no, this is real! I can't. I can't do this anymore! No, don't be scared. I'll show you. - No, I'm going home. - This is home. Delfi, I'm sorry. You can come with me if you want or not, but I've gotta go! No! Come on! - You see? - Let's get out of here! - It's okay. - We go to the city. We go straight to the hospital, okay? - Okay! - Okay. If you still want to. After I take you somewhere. No! Delfi, no! I'm tired. I'm cold. And I'm getting really freaked out here! J-J-Just let me take you somewhere. And then I vow, I promise on our parents' souls, whatever you say. - Please. - Fuck, fine. Where are you taking me? To the most amazing place in the world. - You'll see. - Delfi, listen. I'm not... I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm the one who needs to go to the hospital. Ah, you're just scared. I don't know. I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, you do. That's why you're scared. Trust me. As bad as it gets, the flip's just as brilliant. I don't understand. You will. As soon as you see this place. Well, what's so special about it? It's where we used to practice. A place of power. A place of power in downtown North Bay? We're getting close. I can feel it. Shit, Delfi. Nothing's here. This is it. Oh, I'd find it blindfolded. 911. Hi, we have a psychiatric emergency. - One moment, please. - For fuck's sake, Delfi. You must find the lantern. This is just a dream. Andra! Andra, look. Look, look. See, see? People... people still come here. Oh, my gosh. Imagine. This, this used to be all forest. Okay, okay. I can't believe I'm back here! Isn't it something? Well, how big is this place? It doesn't stop. What's happening here? Nothing. You're blushing. Really? He's coming over. Okay. Okay. So, like, you know that feeling when you feel like you know somebody but you just met? It's... I'm Sid. Andra. Andra? Nice to meet you. - Special place. - Yeah. So I hear. I was actually in the middle of backpacking across Canada. And then, these guys at the hostel in Toronto were, like, "Come check this place out." And I was, like, "Yeah, sure. Why not?" So, I've been here every night for, like, a week now. We just arrived yesterday. Oh. Well, are you staying in town, or... A bit out, actually. Um, it's a really pretty... You should come check it out. Fossmill Cabin. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I feel like I know you. Right. Like you do. Yeah. Right. See what I mean? Like, you're just... - Familiar. - Yeah. You're just different. You probably get that all the time, though. I don't, actually. Thanks. You okay? Great. - I can't think straight. - Oh, my God. - Oh, this place is alive. - Yeah. I want to go there. - Let's go there. - Okay. One. And I am the same. And I am the same. One. Andra! All good? I... It's just... Oh, my God. That was amazing. I just saw the light. Did you see it, too? It was like past, present and future, all here, right now. Blake, Rilke, Eckhart, they tried to capture it. I'm all in. I want in. Okay. Okay, yeah. I'll take you there. I've seen where it leads... ...and, wow! Andra? Delfi. No time,. Thank you for everything. No. Thank you. Fossmill Cabin! I was out of it. I was out of my mind. Everything was glimmering and joined. I felt so free. I mean, it lasted just a moment, but it was enough. Listen, Andra. I need to talk to you. I'm worried about you. Why are you worried? No, Delfi. I'm finally awake. I mean, I've seen with my mind. So beautiful. Andra? No, Andra. Andra! I'm fine. No. It's nothing. Oh. Okay. We made it. Andra? We need to talk. I'm serious, Andra. You came here looking for answers. She's got one, maybe two, days left. What are you saying? It got into her. How? The same way it got into you. Darkness and light are two sides of the same coin. Forever united. In some scenarios, they seep, one into the other. The light so bright that it can burn a hole, as it did in Andra's soul. That's how it got in. It traps souls and stops them from recycling. But I'm here. How did I recycle? There's an exorcism. I performed it. Perform it on Andra, then. It requires a sacrifice. What kind of sacrifice? I won't let it have her. What kind of sacrifice? Shit. This is a dream. You said that before. Andra, wake up. It's almost 2:00... ...p.m.? Andra? Something... Something's wrong... What? What? No, wait. No, wait. Delfi, we go back. What? We go back to the place of power. And if I could just go back to that light... If I just find that light and I'll stay there... I swear. I'll stay there forever, and everything will be okay. Okay? No, no, no. Please. It doesn't work like that, Andra. It doesn't work like that. Please take me back. Andra? - Get back. - Please. You got to let me in. - Please. You don't understand. - I said get back. Why are you sending us away? - Andra... - I'm not leaving till I know. Something foul was around last night. I didn't feel like closing it up. Tonight, though, I'm not taking any chances. Please. You don't understand. Look. You're not the only ones I sent away. It's just this place exposes people. Everyone inside has got to be clean. Well, I'm a good person! Good people catch bad things all the time. That's why I can't have you here. Well, fuck you! Fuck you, you fucking prick. You should have been here yesterday. Where the hell were you yesterday? Oh, fuck that place! Hey, hey, hey. What's going on? Last night, something infected me. I don't know. Breathe, breathe. Everything you're going through, it's just side effects, all right? There's a name for it. It's called kundalini. Look at this! This look like fucking kundalini bullshit to you? I mean, fuck. - You should go to a hospital. - No. Come on. We'll all go to the hospital. Andra, Andra. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Andra, Andra. Hold my hand. I'll fucking kill you! We're almost there. Andra, it's going to be all right. Shut the fuck up. I promise I won't let it get to you. Get out of my face! Andra! - I know you're here. - Andra! Come on, you fuck. Show your fucking disgusting face! Andra, Andra? Andra, open up. Andra? Andra, no! No. Andra! Shit. She didn't mean it. Over here. It's me you're hearing. Come. Let's talk. Andra is in bad trouble. Everything she said is true. Go to her right now. She said she'd kill me. A declaration of undying love. I can't believe that. Go get her now. No. This is bullshit, okay? I've seen, in a dream of a dream, you and her intertwined. Many hundreds of years past... And many more to come. Go to her right now. Andra? Andra? Flee the light. It hunts in the light. Breathe! Remember when we met? Look. I won't. Look. Let's start again, then. Fight it, Andra. You can control it. Run. Run. Control it. Andra? No! See you soon. Hello? Is anyone in here? Is anyone in here? Andra? Now, come. Come to me. Whoa. No, no, no. Andra, I want to help you. I need you... ...to help me. I won't let it have her. It requires a sacrifice. What kind of sacrifice? I've got to make this right. Stay with her. Tell her I'm sorry. Just breathe. Breathe. Focus on me. Focus on my voice. Focus on me. Oh, no, Delfi! Delfi went to get help. She's fine. She's fine, okay? Breathe, Andra, Andra. Focus on my voice. Focus on my voice. Andra! Stay focused on me. Focus on my voice, okay? Breathe, breathe. Andra? Andra, breathe. Andra, breathe. Breathe. Come on. Andra, Andra! Breathe, Andra. Andra. Andra, stay focused on me. Come on. I'm here. Just breathe. It's going to be fine. Come and get me. Fight it. Fight it! Fight it. Fight it! Delfi! No, it doesn't matter. You're okay. No! . You're okay. You're okay. I got you. I got you. I got you. You're okay. Andra. Oh, Delfi. What? Delfi is gone. You sure you don't want me to come with you? I'll be fine. Pat? I just can't get these images out of my head. Delfi trapped in that evil dimension with all that light sucked out of her. That didn't happen to her. She's one of the lucky ones, and you saved her. No. She gave her life to save me. She gave her life, yes. But she saved her soul, which is what the darkness wanted. Her beautiful, mischievous soul. However, thanks to you, it now has a new interest. That burden you mentioned when we first talked? It fixates on the last soul to escape it, as it did with Delfi and those before her. How long has this cycle been going on? Since there's been light, there's been darkness. And now, I'm its latest target? Yes. However, it's not all hopeless. I can teach you ways to be vigilant and to protect yourself. It'll be hard, but you must find the balance. Elude the darkness, but keep it close enough that it can't hunt others. That's the trick. It's a hell of a burden. But a noble one. You're quite strong, Andra. It's very possible that you could survive with the darkness... ...forever. Forever?
