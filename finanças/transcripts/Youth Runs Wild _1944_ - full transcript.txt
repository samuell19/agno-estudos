It's alright. It's only a post. Go on. Back where we come from folks and kind and good. And strangers are welcome. Come on, Nancy darling. Come on, Lucy. Hello Mary. - Hello Mr Martin. Glad to see you back. - Thank you. Would you give this to your dad? Frankie. Mary. Three years, Frankie. Three long years. How you've grown. - What do you expect? I'm fifteen. Shush. Mum and dad. Is this the little guy? Danny's boy. Oh boy, is he heavy. Frankie, what were you doing down in the cellar? Making something. Want to see? Do you like it? I made the initials. It's beautiful, Frankie. Expensive looking too. I bet your girl will like it. What's it for, her birthday? How did you know? - Things get around. Yeah, it's her sixteenth birthday. She's a few months older than me. Do you think that makes any difference? No. I don't think so. I want you to understand there is nothing mushy between us. Just like tonight. It's her birthday and .. I don't have to ask her for a date. She knows I am coming over. Things like that. You know. Yep. I know. Dad. Dad. It's little Stevie. Mary. Mary. Stevie. Stevie. He is up here, Mary. With us. He looks a little bit like you, Fred. He has a Hauser look somehow. Dad. Mary. Darling. - Mum. Come on, fellah. He's a fine boy, Mary. A fine boy. I want some water. He wants a drink of water. - I'll get him some. Come on, Stevie. Mary, this is wonderful. Sit down, Mary. You must be tired. It's so good to be with both of you again. I've been a pretty proud man, Mary, since your letter. My son-in-law getting a medal. That is something. I didn't tell you what kind of a medal it was. It's a Purple Heart. He's been wounded. Bad? I don't know. He doesn't say. He just said that .. He'll be out of the hospital soon. And for me to come here and wait for him. That is all. - Now, Mary. Don't worry. If it was bad he would have told you. But daddy. Mr Martin asked me to give you this. 'Notice of Truancy'. 'Hauser'. 'Frank. Four days'. What's got into the kid? Frank. - Yes, dad? Come here a minute. - He hasn't missed a day in ten years. He likes school. Some guy. He drank a whole glass of water. He held the glass too. Well, Frank. Is that right? Yes, sir. Frank, how could you do it? When you know I'm working every night for you. Hoping and saving and planning for your education. Mom. Alright, Frank. You've done it and it's done. We'd like to know why. I don't know. I just didn't feel like going I guess. We'd better get ready, Cora. I haven't time now, Frank. We'll talk about this tomorrow. I want to know what is behind this truancy. Goodnight. - Night. Goodnight, Mrs Loring. - Goodnight. Dorothy. Dorothy. Hello dad. How did it go at the plant today? What are you shaving for, dad? - Going out. Mom going with you? - Yep. You said last night .. You promised me. - You can go out tomorrow night. But I've got a date. - Change the date. That Hauser kid will keep. You look just beautiful in that, mummy. Sarah is beautiful. - Sarah is not beautiful. She hasn't got pretty dresses like mummy. But Sarah works hard. She works hard but she's not beautiful. But she's going out tonight. Is Sarah going out tonight, Nancy? Sure. She's going with Frankie Hauser. She ironed her dress and washed her stockings. And put pins in her hair and she's going to look beautiful when she goes out. Hey, dad. Yeah, what? Sarah is planning to go out tonight. You fix it with her. You heard your mother. You'd think you'd feel sorry for your mother when she works hard all day long. I do. But I want some fun too. I want to get out. It's my birthday. Birthday or not, you're staying home. - No. I said you're staying home. - No. We'll see about that. What's the matter? - Come on. Let's get out of here. Dad didn't want me to go out. You sneaked? - I told him I was going. He promised me. Sarah, here is something for you. A birthday present. Sarah. Sarah. It's a handbag, Sarah. Don't you like it? It's the nicest bag. It is the nicest present. Sarah. Let's go over to my place. Come on. Want to go down Main Street, Sarah? No. I just want to sit here and look at this. Sarah. Sarah. Frankie, let's go. - Down on Main Street? Anywhere. It's ugly here. - Okay. Frankie. You didn't put a penny in it. That breaks friendship. Come on. Let's go. Hey, that's a nice chick with Frankie. Yeah. The Taylor kid. Sort-of cute. Hi, Sarah. - Hello Toddy. Hi, Larry. Spending all the dough you earned yesterday? Already spent it. Couldn't have spent it better. Birthday. Boy. I'd sure like to wear one of those. I like something more comfortable. He doesn't need a uniform for his campaign. I'll have a dress like that someday. A beautiful dress. I will dance with the skirt sweeping around me in some wonderful place. Places like you read about. Like Rocky's Cave? I don't know. I've never been there. Want to go? We're just out for a walk, Larry. Don't worry about the dough, Frankie. This will be on me. Make him come along, Sarah. But I don't think I should go. We just said we were going for a walk. Don't you want to see the show and hear the band? What are we waiting for? No. I can't go. Frankie and I are taking a walk. That settles that. Well, so long. Thinking of opening a second front? Boy, If my folks would only let me work. Then I could do all the things I want to do. To take you dancing where you'd like to go and to places you'd like to go to. You know, they need welders ever worse than soldiers. But your mother wants you to go to school, Frankie. Yeah. That's the trouble. What a neat, well-mannered little boy. Stevie. Stevie. Your mouth is here. That bit on the side there is your ear. You leave him alone. He has to learn in his own way. Frankie, what's this about you not going to school? Mum was awfully upset. Nothing much. It's just that I don't want to go to school. The girl next door, wasn't it? You stayed off school to earn money to buy her the pocketbook for her birthday. That was it, wasn't it? Well, something like that. But it's not why I want to leave school. On account of Sarah. No. It's because Danny is fighting and .. Mum and dad work at the plant. Everybody is doing something but me. All I do is go to school. Frankie, I know how you feel. This war is about you. To give boys like you their chance. And Mum. That's why she's working so hard. So that you can go to college. And know things. It would kill her if you quit school just to have a good time with a girl. That's not the point, Mary. The point is that other fellows would take Sarah out and .. And I can't. Aren't you willing to risk that for mum's happiness? I guess so. So long. - So long, Frankie. [ Telephone ] Hello? Western Union? Just a minute please. Mary. Mary. There's a Western Union message for you. Coming. Hello. She'll be here in just a minute. Hello? Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's from Danny. He'll be home tomorrow, Frankie. He'll be home tomorrow. Isn't it late for mummy and daddy? - We've had dinner. We go to bed now. That's right. You don't have to wait. - I am so going to wait up. But Lucy's going to be a good girl and go to bed. Won't you? Alright. Off to bed. Goodnight. - Night. You are a very good girl. Well, I am a good girl too. I wonder if Mum will think you're a good girl. I am a good girl. So I said: 'How about a date, babe? I ain't got much time to fool around'. What did she say? - What you think? She said 'yes'. Naturally. - I can't believe it. That's what you say. This is my kid, Bart. I bet You didn't think I had a youngster as old as this. Yikes. If I had a hand I'd tip my hat. Take that stuff from Bart, Sarah. Step lively. Serve it forth. See if you can find the chips, Mabel. - Okay. There you are. Go and get the beer, will you. You should have let me know. Come on. Let's get going. I feel lucky. Did you hear that fresh lead man on the line today? Calling me dumb because I had no hairnet. Could I be lead man in your department? Oh boy. Nothing but dames. Yikes. Sarah, why don't you go out and go somewhere? Maybe to the movies. - May I? Yes. I'll get the sandwiches. Mum, thanks. My, my. What a bring down. You just pick on somebody your size, Bart. Okay. Everybody ante up. [ Door knocks ] Who's there? Me. Sarah Taylor. Is Frankie home? No. He went to the movies. What theater did he go to? - The Strand. He was meeting George. He left about ten minutes ago. - Thanks. Bye. Where you going? - Down to The Strand. Want a lift? Sit in front, Sarah. There is plenty of room. Going all alone? - I thought I'd meet Frankie. His sister said he went to The Strand. Chasing him, huh? Goodbye, darling. Good luck always. Thanks, Larry. Bye, Toddy. What a minute, Sarah. Hey boy. What? Have you seen Frankie Hauser come in here? No. I haven't. You'd know him when you see him? - Sure. We're pals. He hasn't been around then? - Not this evening. Looks like the boyfriend walked out on you, toots. I'll just walk on home. Do some window shopping on the way. - Do you want to go home? Not much. The folks are having a party. - Then come with us. We're going out to the park. Yes indeed. Please come with us. Lay off, Toddy. You come with us, Sarah. We'll have fun. "Ladies and gentlemen." "We are all aware of the importance of conserving material." "And salvaging everything which may in a small way .." "Aid our country." Hi, Eddie. - Hi, Frankie. "However, it is not generally known .." "That we still are not conserving to the utmost." Say, Frankie. I just saw your girl outside. What a wolf he is. - What do you mean? I saw her out there with that Duncan character. Out tootling around in his car. Yeah. I seen it myself. That Duncan is too high-powered for her to be fooling around with. Ah well. I guess she knows what she's doing though. "I am therefore going to give a concrete example." Come on. Let's get out of here. This is gruesome. Sure. Got a lawyer? Not me. I paid my way in. Come on. Pull out of here. Can't you see you're blocking off the cash customers? Ain't you brats got nothing to do? There ain't nothing to do. We ain't got any dough. It's easy enough to get these days. Maybe that's why we dropped around. What's the matter with him? His girl is out with your boss. - Is that so? Yeah. That Larry is quite a brute with the babes. Look. Shut up, will you. What's troubling you? After all, a girl has to see some part of life. You can't even take her to a movie. She stood him up. Why not? Take a look at the guy. No spunk. No initiative. He's got stuff enough, Dickens. He just ain't got any dough. And I know how to get it. Yeah. But you can't do it alone you know. These guys will help me. Help you do what? Not me. I got to go home. My dad gets sore. Wait. Listen to what Herb has to say. He's done it before. Okay. What is it? Money. If you got what it takes. - I got what it takes. Your girl don't seem to think so. - Listen. Leave her out of it. Just tell me what it is. I will tell you. George, you can drive. We can't even get a waiter to serve us in this dismal joint. We've waited a half hour. Okay. Don't make a fuss. I'll take the order. I'll have some of this and some of that. Got you. What are you having? I'd like a double chocolate malt. Lady, are you kidding? Same for me. Now I know you're kidding. Just go ahead and get it. After the soft drinks it's down to the park. Okay. It's your order. Chocolate malted milks. Chump. I like being a chump sometimes. It's fun. It's a relief from being a wise guy and being with wise guys. You can play games alone. I'm sitting with Lyla and her boyfriend. - Wait a minute. Sit down. If you don't like it here we'll go someplace else or we'll go home. But when you're with me you stay with me. You can't go yellow on me now. You said you'd do it. But you don't know my old man. - Your old man. What's your old man got to do with this? We ain't going to get caught. If you do get caught you'll be in jail. He won't be able to hurt you anyhow. You mean, they won't let your old man in jail? Not in reform school. They don't. You're a ward of the court. Ain't that right, Frankie? Yes. I guess so. I think I learned that in civics class. I learned it from juvenile hall. See, there's nothing to be scared of, is there? No. I suppose not. Come on. What's holding us? Come on, Frank. Gee, Herb. Yeah? You know something? You're not going yellow on me too? No. It's just, I don't know why I'm doing this. I'll tell you why. Because you got enough right stuff inside you to make some dough. And to hang on to your girl. That's it, ain't it? Yeah. I suppose so. George, just keep it running. Dickens. Stream a little juice into it. - Yeah. Ever seen my station before, Sarah? - I've walked past with Frankie. He told me he works here sometimes. Yeah. He's the lobby guy around here on odd afternoons. He does his work. He stayed home from school three days last week to sand down a car for me. That's a main job. Is that how he got the money for my bag? I guess so. How has it been tonight, Dickens? - Just about the usual. I got Herb and a couple of kids out taking a few doughnuts. Up at the plant? - Yeah. Rubber is growing thick up there. Nice new tires that I can deal out to some of them workers. Who went with Herbie? A couple of kids. Frankie and a kid named George. I never seen him before. Frankie Hauser? - Yes. You know how I feel about the Hausers. Mary and I went to school together. They're decent people. You shouldn't send the kid. So what? One kid is like another. But I've always liked the Hausers. Always looked up to them. What's the matter? Getting soft? Stick the cap back on. How long since those kids left? About 15 minutes. I'm going there. I don't want Frankie mixed up in it. He is a good kid. What's the hurry? Where we going? This is my night to play sucker. I've got a date to do me a good deed. Frank. Hand me that file. What about this kid yapping? Maybe someone will come to attend to him. Don't worry about it. Lots of kids are like that. Their folks can't have a place to leave them. See if the night watchman is asleep. Hey. Check the guy on the post. Give me Gate 7. Okay. Thanks a lot. Hey you. Stop. Stop or I'll fire. Why don't they stop? [ Gunshots! ] George, he's got a gun. Herbie, he missed. George, get going. Keep on going, Georgie. You're slowing down. See that car outside the parking lot? - Nah. I was too busy. Wait a minute. Larry's hit. He was shot out at the plant. Anybody follow you? - I don't think so. Help me get him into the office. - Yep. I'll get some water. - He can't drink no water. He's unconscious. - Yeah. He's bleeding bad. I guess you'd better call an ambulance. - I don't like to do it. It will cause trouble. - He might die. Okay. Hello operator. Call the hospital. I must get out of here. Hospital? Send an ambulance right away to Duncan Service Station, 1560 Walter Street. A shooting. I don't know. Yeah. If I can find one. He said to keep him warm. Cover him up with a blanket. There might be one out in one of the cars. Come on. Let's go. He's called for the ambulance. - We can't leave him here like this. Somebody's got to stay with him. I love the guy and I can't stay. I won't let you stay. Come on. We can't leave him alone. - I won't let you stay here. Come on. He'll be alright, won't he Toddy? How do I know? Well, what are you waiting for? You got no business here. You're a kid and you ought to stay with kids. Get back to that boyfriend of yours and make up with him. You got no business with fellows like Larry. Or with me. Now go on, beat it. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you again. This is all your fault. Now go on. Go on back home with the other kids. Can you make it alright then? - Getting used to them. And you were voted the most glamorous girl in the senior class. You don't think I can be glamorous on this job? You should listen to the offers I get. Seen Mary since she got back? - No. But I tell you one thing. She sits on pins and needles waiting for you. Well, she won't have to wait any more. Mary. Mary. What does that mean? I don't know. Maybe Frankie got in trouble. You know how kids are these days. I don't get it. Why did Mary have to go? Why not mother Hauser or dad? I guess they don't want to be absentees. They got to get their sleep. You boys are being held on a traffic violation. Going 50 miles an hour in a 25 zone. The arresting officer thought it necessary to make the comment .. That you were all unusually nervous. And acted very strangely when he arrested you. Perhaps you boys will tell me .. Why you were speeding. What about you? Your Honor. It's like this. We were in a hurry to get to a dance before it was over. So we thought that .. You can't come in here, soldier. I am Dan Coates. My young brother-in-law is in there. Frankie Hauser. To keep you boys from doing anything more serious than speeding .. I could put you in the charge of a probation officer. But I'm looking for a stronger guardian. To keep you from any serious errors. Danny. Are you this young man's brother? No, sir. He's my brother-in-law. And do you know the other boys? I know Herb here. His brother Jack is in my outfit. Come here a minute. If I ask you to accept the parole of these three boys .. To use your influence, your thoughts and your actions. To help to keep them good citizens. Would you accept it? Why, sure. Yes. I am going to parole these boys in your care. It's a great responsibility. Why did you go, Frank? What did you need the tires for? - Money, I guess. But why? Well, I thought it was for money but now I don't know. I just wondered while I was waiting for the judge. I couldn't figure it out. I guess I was sore. - Sore? I was mad at you. Somebody said I went out with Larry? That was because I couldn't find you. - That's why I was sore. I really felt rotten. The other kids were going and .. It seems to me it was money. He had it and I didn't. Now it's not like that. Frankie. You were jealous and so you stole the tires. That is silly. Dumb. I'm happy when I'm with you, Frankie. I trust you and I'm not afraid of you. You and I trust each other, Sarah. I shouldn't have thought you went out with Larry for anything bad. I trust you. Kids are just the same as they always were. It's the war and these new people. New people from all sorts of places. Without the slightest notion of how to live decently. I'm afraid it's more than that. Take Frank. He was always a good boy. Now he's been a truant on account of that girl Sarah. And all that trouble about the speeding. I still don't know what that's all about. Something to do with a girl. I know it. There's nothing you can do. He won't stop seeing her because we say so. Not if we say so. But Mom .. She can do anything with him. I told you Sarah didn't have anything to do with it. She wasn't even with us. Before she came here you never did anything wrong. It's the new people on the street. This used to be a decent neighborhood. Mum, Mary. This is all crazy. You know she didn't have anything to do with that. Sarah is a good girl. She is sweet. I've never known anyone like her. Or even half as nice. That's what we're afraid of, Frankie. That's why we don't want you to see her. You care too much about her. She has too much influence over you. You're too young to think seriously about girls. You got your education to think about. It will mean the ruin of all my hopes. It will break my heart. You can't do this to, mum, Frankie. I don't know. It seems sort-of silly to me. All this fuss. Frankie. I am your mother. You've got to listen to me. The ambulance is on the way to the hospital now. It left just a few minutes ago. Our number here is Elm 4702. Yes, sir. Hauser. Anything we can do. Goodbye. Did you talk to her folks? No. It was the plant superintendent. He said he'll find out what departments they're in and let them know. Poor people. It could have been us, Danny. Think of that. I am thinking of it. And it makes me feel guilty. There's more to war than fighting. What it does to kids. That's just as much our job. But they want people to work in defense factories, Danny. They can't work and raise their kids at the same time. I know. There ought to be something we can do about it. [ Telephone ] I'll get it. Hello? No. No. It's the kid's mother. But I am telling the truth. You had better go on to the hospital, Mrs Graham. Of course they'll let you see her. Of course. There is a good chance. She went all to pieces. But Dan, there is something we can do. Something you and I can do. And we're going to do it. Here you are. A couple of you kids come over and try this. Thank you, Danny. Always glad to do what I can to help the good work. Don't kid me, Dan. Bomb bay doors open. Bombs away. Hey. No more running in the streets for you. From now, you have a real place to play. Not for me. That kindergarten is just kid's stuff. Come on. You're going to have a better place to play. You know I love kids. I only figure that I'm doing something useful. Mary. Here is another victim for you. Oh, we are old friends. Thank you. How would you like a glass of milk? - No, I want some ginger ale. Alright. Hi, Frankie. Hi, Sarah. Have you told her yet? Uhuh. Better go and get it over with. Yeah. I guess I had better. Do you know any commando tricks? Sure. This one. I must keep you around here as an assistant. I got my own job cut out for me. I'm afraid it's going to be a little harder than this one. I've asked the boys over tomorrow afternoon. Guess what. Mum says I can go out tonight. They're going to play cards and don't want me disturbing them. Isn't that wonderful? It will be our first chance to go out together since Larry was hurt. We don't have to go anywhere. We can just walk. Frankie, don't you want to go? I can't. Why? Why can't you? - Well. You know, since all that trouble my folks feel I should do more studying. But tonight's a Saturday. But they want me to grind at it. I won't be able to see you much, Sarah. Because you have to study? Yeah. That's it. There's a scholarship at the State Uni' that I might get. They didn't tell you not to see me. Your sister. She doesn't like the new people on the street. She's not my sister. She is my mum. She feels I shouldn't see you anymore. She made me promise. And you promised? You promised not to see me anymore? You promised. Danny. I've got a good one. You grab the guy down like this. Danny, show me one. Take it easy. It's easy. Just relax. Grab him this way. And this way. And then over. Danny, take it easy. - That won't hurt him. He's tough. Not him. You. Your legs. My gimpy leg. I forgot about that. Soldier, show me that again. I want to get the hang of it. It's alright for you to know it, Herb. You'll make a better soldier. But remember that trick is for war. Don't use it in kick fights. - No. Come on. Show it to me again. Not that way, Herb. Grab his wrist. That's the idea. Frankie, want to learn how to do this? No. Wait a minute. That's enough. I will not have that leg hurt again. Sarah. Toddy. Your door was open so I just walked in on you. Please sit down. Over here. Surprised to see me? You said you never wanted to see me again. That's right. I came because I want a favor. Don't look so dumb. I don't expect you to know until I tell you. I want you to go and see Larry for me. Won't they let you see him? No. He's under arrest. Cops are watching him in his room at the hospital. They won't let anybody see him? - You can see him. It's just me. On account I've got a record and am on probation. You mean you'll go? I don't know what you want me to do. Well, I want to know how he is. I want to know if he's thinking of me. What did you think I wanted? Look. I wouldn't come here to you after the other night .. If I didn't want to know these things bad. Would I? I guess not. Alright then. Go on. Get some clothes on. Let's go. - But my wash. Skip it. - The folks. The dinner. Let them fix it themselves. I can't do that. It's on account of you this happened. Don't you forget that. Alright. I'll go with you. Okay. And snap it up. Go on. On your way. Well? I saw him. He's alright. He says it doesn't hurt much. He said to say there's no pretty nurses. Is that all? - No. Get it out. - Wait a minute. I'll tell you everything. He said he was going to run the garage straight from now on. I don't quite understand it. - No. You wouldn't. What did he say about me? Did he say anything about me? He said to give you this. For him. He said you would know. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Well. No use standing around here. Look. Why don't we go out to the park? If you're to get balled out you might as well get balled out for having fun. Not for just doing me a favor. Come on. I'll take you to the park. Come on. Clear that mess. We want to get out of here tonight. The joint's closed, Toddy. Yes. I know. I just came in to ask you for a ride back to town. I can't do that. No coupons. Come on, be a sport. The kid and I missed the last bus. Use the thumb. You can't do that with a kid. I don't want her in any trouble. Oh yeah. The young lady who wants chocolate malts. We came out for some fun. - And we had fun. Look. I won this playing ski-ball. Toddy taught me. Toddy can teach you a lot. Yeah? How do I to teach her to get home with the last bus gone? Don't ask me. You can bed down in the lounge if you want. I just ain't got no gas. How about that, kid? You want to sleep here? My folks will be sore. Don't worry about it. I'll fix it for you. I can't drink that stuff. - The coffee? I wouldn't call it that. I don't know what I'd call it but I wouldn't call it coffee. I'll kill that kid when she gets home. I don't know what she's thinking of. I never stayed out late at her age. Maybe not. But you never stayed home long enough to learn how to make coffee. That's all you think of. The coffee. She isn't here to give it to you. That is her now. Where you been? - At the park, dad. I can explain. You don't have to explain nothing. One look at you .. Ma is right. You don't have to explain nothing. It's written on your face in big letters and spells no good. Won't you let her talk? You talk enough. You and girls like you. You couldn't believe that your own kid was good and straight and clean. That's too much to expect of your own kid, isn't it? All you want is for her to do your dirty work while you get drunk in a bar room. And keep your house and keep your kids. And make coffee for your hangovers. A great father you are. She's too good for that. She comes with me. - Toddy. Come on, Sarah. I got a couple of beds and .. I'll get you a job where they pay you for working. Please. - Get out. Both of you. Birds of a feather. You're no good. - Too good for you. Wait a minute. I can't leave my mum and dad and kid sisters like this, Toddy. You know I can't. They're my folks. Your folks are supposed to love you. Your mum and dad don't care about you. They wouldn't let you go if they did. Look. I know all about this. I had a bad time of it when I was a kid. I got out of the house when I was fourteen. So I wouldn't have to listen to mum and my old man yelling. When they got tired of yelling at each other they'd pick on me. Everybody is nasty to kids. Come home with me and I'll see people treat you like a grown up. Hi. Hello Toddy. Hi, Sarah. - Go on. Beat it. You'll never get another chance to be mean to Sarah. Here, junior. Well. This is it. You couldn't call it sensational but I get along. I like it, Toddy. It's nice. Make yourself at home. You can sleep here. And there's plenty of room in there. You can have half the closet all to yourself. That's right. You didn't bring anything, did you? Come here. I want to see something. Here. Hold the shoulders. Sure. All it needs is a little fixing. Then you couldn't wear it. You have to get a job, don't you? I'm going to get you a job at Rocky's. You mean work there? - What else? You can do it. All you have to do is show a little glamour and .. Laugh at the customer's jokes. Of course, that's not always so easy. But Rocky's is such a grown-up place. That's right. I thought you were tired of being a kid and getting kicked around. You've listened to people's gossip. Rocky's isn't any worse than any other place. Nothing is going to happen to you. I'll be there. And I'll take care of you. I know you will, Toddy. Can we fix the dress now? Wait a minute, Eddie. You have to slide it more and put a camber on it. Slide it over. Slide it over. How's that? - Fine. Only put more beef in it. - Okay. Is it better than the stuff in the shop? - You'll be a machinist in no time. It ain't for me. I can't see us doing that all day long. I like rugged work. I see Mr Beal at the lumber yard tomorrow. I'll speak to him about a rugged job for you. Say, how is that? Pretty good for a beginner. So ends the first lesson. Oh boy. I'll take this home and show it to my old man. I'll go along with you. - Fine. I ran into Ed Wilson at the plant today. He said he'll be out to see you tomorrow, Dan. I hoped he'd drop by. - One of the kids you're looking after? How you making out? Pretty good. I got the Wilson kid saving his money and taking night courses. He used to just throw his pay away. It's not so hard dealing with kids. You just find something for them to do. Make them feel important. Get places for them to play. Keep them away from joints and bad company. It's easy enough. Frankie's not himself lately. I tried to talk to him last Sunday. But I couldn't seem to reach him. He is not my boy. It seems Frankie's done alright since the Taylor girl left the neighborhood. No. He is not alright. There is something wrong. Something's eating at him. Not so loud, dad. He's out on the porch. Don't worry, dad. Frankie is my job. He shouldn't be, Dan. - Things get twisted about during a war. What's wrong, Frankie? Wrong? Nothing's wrong. I just want to be alone. That's all. - I've watched you. You're off the beam. Look, kid. It's easy to get fresh with me. You know, no matter how fresh you get I won't pop you one. Because I'm your friend. I want to help you. Yeah. You mean you want to reform me. I don't care what you call it so long as you open up and tell me what's wrong. You know how hard I try to help you. I've worked with Herb and the other kids. We get along alright. You are the only holdout. Are you sore at me? Suppose I did tell you what's wrong? What could you do about it? I don't know, Frank. I really don't. Why not give me a break and let me try? Has it anything to do with Sarah? I never did agree Mary's notion that it was Sarah's fault. Mary? So that was all her idea? Wait a minute. Not all her idea. The families and me too. We were all worried about you. It seemed reasonable to us .. That the new girl next door would have a lot to do with you cutting up. And she's going away now. We don't have to worry about that anymore. No, you don't have to worry about it. You don't even have to think about it anymore. But me? Well, what about you? No. I can't get it off my mind. I can't stop thinking about it or worrying about it. Wanting to know what she's doing. What is happening to her. So it's that way, huh? No. No. It's not that way. Because I'm the guy who's caused all the troubles. Do you know where she is? At Rocky's. You know what she is doing? She works there. You know what that means. All those rotten people in that joint. I know she wouldn't have left because of what I'd done. I'm not kidding myself. It must have hurt. Hurt hard when I told her I couldn't see her again. But she's just a kid. It wouldn't upset her like that. Yeah. That's what I keep telling myself. But it don't go, Dan. That's why she left and I know it. If she turns out no good it will be my fault. Whatever happens to her will be my fault. Well. You wanted to know what's wrong. That's what's wrong. If you're worrying about whose fault it is .. I guess it's more mine than anybody else's. I interfered without knowing enough. That is the trouble. And I've got to make it right. That's the way the kid feels about it and that's why I'm here. Wait a minute. You don't know what I came to tell you. What I've come to offer. I know you don't want to go back home .. After all the trouble with your folks and everything. The Hausers have a spare room. They'd let you stay there. Then you can get a job at a decent place. Rocky's isn't a bad place to work. Everybody has been nice to me here. Nobody has been nicer to me than Toddy. She's done everything for me. She doesn't let anyone hurt me or get tough with me. You're a kid. You don't understand. I'm not a kid anymore. I understand a lot. Look, Sarah. I am only trying to correct a mistake. A mistake that started with Mary and went right on through until it hit you. The kind of mistake we all make about new people. We think that any trouble that comes along, they bring it with them. It's the wrong way of thinking. Well, I am glad I left home. People are nice to me here. That's a lot more I can say for anybody on Euclid Street. What about Frankie? I thought you liked Frankie. That is the real reason I'm here. The kid needs you. That's why I want you to come back. If you'd come two weeks ago. Or a week ago, I could have gone back. Now it's .. Too late. And I've grown up. I am not a kid anymore. Frankie is still a kid on Euclid Street. He will forget me. It will be alright. Do you want me to tell him that tomorrow? Just tell him I don't want to see him. Not anymore. What's he after? I suppose your folks sent him. Trying to get you back again. What's the idea? He wants me to live with him. You mean with the Hausers? With Frankie's family? They don't feel I ought to work here. Frankie feels it's his fault. Maybe they're on the beam at that. They're nice people, the Hausers. They'd be good to you. Besides, you could be with Frankie. - I couldn't do it, Toddy. Why not? I would be right next door to my folks. They might start something. It wouldn't work out. - Is that what you told Danny? I told him I couldn't go back. That things were different now. You know that isn't true. Why did you tell him a thing like that? You little fool. He'll probably believe you. It would keep Frankie away from me. I am no good for him, Toddy. He gets into trouble on account of me. If I am not around he will study. And grow up to be somebody. The way his family wants. That's what I want too. So you saw her? Yes. I saw her. She's feeling fine. She's happy. But she doesn't want to see you. Did she tell you that? Yes. That's what she told me. Frankie, she's a different girl since she left here. She is older. More experienced. She is .. She has outgrown you. You'll just have to take it. She doesn't want to see you. You're sure she said that? Uhuh. Like to do me a favor? Sure. Can you drive me to Rocky's caf? today? Out at the park? We can drive you out but .. What do you want to go out there for? I got to see somebody. Okay. We pick you up after supper. Swell. So long, Frankie. - So long. Thanks a lot, chief. It's a swell court. - You're welcome. Any time. Thanks. We'll wait for you, Frankie. - Okay. Hey, Eddie. Look what's coming. Kinda nice, huh? Herbie, what are you doing here? Hi, Blanche. What are you kids doing in the park? Lay off. We're not kids. We've a right to go anyplace. I knew you when you were in panties. Yeah? We develop faster now. Hello Frankie. I want you to meet a friend of mine. A very good friend of mine. This is Corporal .. Corporal ..? - Hays. Jim Hayes. Hi. Frank goes to high school over at Middletown. You're a junior there, aren't you Frankie. I want to talk to you, Sarah. To see you alone. He means me. Don't go, Jimmy. Please don't go. Won't you sit down with us, Frankie? Sarah, I have to talk to you. There's things I must say. Things to clear up. Really? I cannot imagine what you could have to say to me. I don't have much time for youngsters these days. Why not give him a chance? Jimmy. Don't 'Jimmy' me. I don't even know you. He may be a kid but he has feelings. Let him talk to you. Please, Sarah. Please listen to me. I want you to know how sorry I am for everything. I want you to know that I shouldn't have listened to Mom. She doesn't understand, Sarah. And. I want you to know that I love you. No. I don't want to hear. - I have to make you listen. You're just a kid. I don't think about you anymore. I don't want to think about you. Rocky. This kid is under age. You'll be in trouble if he stays. Been served yet? - No. But someone may slip him a drink. I just came in to talk to Sarah. - I won't talk to him. I think he'll get you in trouble. Come on. Outside. Mister, I just got a few things I want to say. She don't want to listen to you. Go on. Get out. She's under age too. No she isn't. I know how old she is. Now you get out. Want some trouble, huh? I'll give you trouble. It was Frank, Toddy. - Yeah. I know. I saw him. You still carry a torch for that guy? Why didn't you make him stay then? He couldn't. Here comes Frankie. What happened to you? Got thrown out. - Under age I'd bet. They can't do that to us. They got kids in there younger than us. - Yeah. If I'm old enough to work, I'm old enough to go anyplace. Let's get back in there. Come on, Frank. Better not start anything. You kids will get hurt. Not me. I know a few commando tricks. I learned them from an expert. Here. Powder your nose. Hey, what's wrong with her? - Ah, she'll be alright. What do you kids want? We can come in now. - Who do you think you are? I'll show you. Cut it out. What's going on here? Get her some water. - Okay. Am I dying? It's in the hands of God. It is His will always. I want. I want a run for my money. I never had it. I haven't even had kids. I won't make it up. I want to die. That's all I could do, Dan. - I know. I can't help but worry how these two kids will take it. It's not their fault really. Neither Frankie nor Sarah. - That's what makes this job so tough. Kids may sometimes be guilty of crimes but it's rare when it's their own fault. Neglectful parents. Modern life. The breaking up of the home. They've got so many reasons for trouble. In these two cases I had no choice. I had to send Frankie to the forestry camp. I can only hope that as human beings they've got heart enough to take it. And Dan. I think they have. Hi, Sarah. Frank. - Sarah. Gee. I hoped you'd be here, Sarah. It won't be long. Only eighteen months. With good behaviour. It will go by pretty quick though. There's plenty to do. What about you? - I'll be alright. I'll be happy waiting for you. Don't you worry about Sarah. She'll be just as busy as you are. Come on, son. Let's get started. We're late now. Gee, it's nice to see the children safe and happy. You're not happy, are you Sarah? - I don't know. It seems as if I don't belong anywhere now. Of course you were all wonderful to me. - It's because you've grown up too fast. I think it's a lucky break. It means you can see both sides. And that's when you can really help people. I want to show you something. Something I've been reading lately. I guess I am too late. It doesn't matter. The point is, there's a girl like you in Moline. Moline Illinois. A girl called Ruth Lipton. A year ago, Moline was frankly ashamed of its children. The problem was getting worse every day. Ruth was just a kid herself but .. She had some ideas and the town listened to them. This recreation center is the answer. Plenty of fun and activity. No headaches. They scratched delinquency out of the dictionary in Moline. That spark from Moline went to Radford Virginia. And a thousand towns over the country. Men and women worked eagerly to help youth help itself. Our government knows that .. Juvenile citizenship spreads faster than juvenile delinquency. That is why they maintain nurseries. And encourage older boys to work part-time in war plants. Girls like Toddy. And boys like Frankie. We're not going to waste them anymore. We need them. We need the best that's in them. After all, they are what we're fighting for. You see, Sarah. All this is just the beginning. There's so much more to be done. Goodbye, Danny. - Where you going? I've got places to go. And things to do. See you at dinner. ..s-d..
