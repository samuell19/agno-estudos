Like the sea otters, they hunt in packs. Isn't that a joyful sight? On their native shores, their efficiency is optimal. They endure the roughest of oceans. Their bare feet don't fear any rocks. Goodness, nature is so generous. Who wouldn't dream of exploring those hills and valleys? Dear customer, which one is it? Oh, she jumped. She disappeared in the water. - That one is perfect for me. - Alright, then. Tami-Chan, nicknamed "Pearl of Youth". - Let me take care of it. - That would be great. Hey, hey, watch it. Thank you. Hey, what's the address?

Last night... he offered me plenty of beer and sake. Probably to take advantage of me. But he fell asleep in the middle of the action. It's called "falling asleep at the wheel". But he couldn't even get on board. What fun is that for a girl? I was mad. You should sneak in his room tonight. And wake him up for some action. There's a good reason they call us the "sneaky divers". Look at you, Rei-Chan! They never fall asleep with you. - Well, I can't tonight. - Why is that? - It's that time of the month. - Is it? Right. I really didn't need that today. Right when my husband is back... - Kenichi was absent? - He was in Choshi. So you'll need a cleansing. Right. Alright. Hey, Rei-Chan, you seem to enjoy it. Not at all. I'm just like you. I crave men even more at that time. It's like my ass is on fire. Look at my abalones! The eggplants look delicious. You're right. What shall I cook? Would you like turban shell? Freshly fished! I'll buy something. - Thanks. - I'll take it. Alright. ONJUKU PORT See you. Your turn. I'm gonna get this piece. I'm back. You're back early today. There. Hey. I'm gonna get this piece. What? No, it's your turn. You're distracted. Tell him to go. - Huh? - Can't you take a hint? Ah, right. I get it. What do you think of that move? It's over. Hey, what is that? We're done here. - See you. - See you? Hey? Hey, at least you could let me win a game. Oh, I get it now. That figures. You had her mom and now you have Takako. You're such a ladies' man! - It's not like that. - See you. Goodbye. Come on. Hey! What? Did you call me? Nobody called you! What is she mad about? Is this some kind of joke? I wanted you so much I couldn't think right. Wait, I'll wash my hands. - Who cares about that? - Wait a minute. Please, I can't wait. What are you doing? Where are the condoms? - It's fine. - It's fine? We'll be fine. Oh, I could come any minute. Please give me a lot of pleasure! Ah, you're bleeding. It's my period. It's fine! Are you silly? I can't take any of that. Can't you just refrain once a month? It's like a wound. It could get infected. You could become sterile after an infection. You hate it that much? Not at all. I'm saying this out of concern for your health. You think I'm filthy, right? No, I said I'm concerned for your health. - Nonsense. - It's not nonsense! A man who really loves his wife would even lick it. - Surely not. - It's true! It's just that you don't love me. You're silly! It's precisely because I love you! It's the truth. - If you love me, take me. - Enough now! Please! Give me a break, idiot! How do you dare, you idiot! You're hysteric now. Leave me alone. Hysteric? Hysteric you say? I hate you now. What do you want? Someone who can't satisfy his wife is not a man. Idiot! How dare you! Goodbye, goodbye. I wish you godspeed. When two lovers part... surely they'll meet again. Even if you left me for years... I would never have another one. I'll be waiting, waiting for you... How are you? Beware, this one is a Don Juan. How have you been? I heard you fought with your man. I'm offering my services to soothe your grief. I'm done with men. That's a very bold statement. I can't bear to see you so sad. Don't reject me. I'm a good man. You should try me for a change. You're so full of yourself. I dislike your kind. Don't let appearances deceive you. I'm good at heart. Just try me once. Men like you are a dime a dozen. Look at yourself! What are you saying? - I'm not quitting. - Hey, watch it. - Rei-Chan is married. - I'm just fooling around. - Are you really? - Don't forget our business. - How about tonight? - At the 'Wind & Sun Inn', at 9. WIND & SUN INN Oh, come on! Calm down! The boss won't have it! - Wait until they sleep. - I can't wait. I'm tired of waiting. I don't want them to hear us! Who cares about that. When I'm excited, I don't care about rain or thunder. Tell me, are you really married? I am. Why? You can't really trust anyone lately. Last night, at a bar, I ended up with a virgin. I promise you that I am not. Just once I wanted to try a married woman. Oh. The way you look at it, I feel strange. Hey, what took you so long? You're late! Like I had a choice. I thought that geezer pervert was never going to finish. The next one is young. If you do it right, it'll be over quickly. Alright. Hey, what kind of seat is that? What? There's a bulge that fits right into my pussy. I'm already starting to feel strange. Idiot. Whatever makes you happy. Look at you, it made you happy. Just stay here with me until Kenichi begs you to come back. Frankly, any man would perform better than your husband. There. I already drink a lot at that bar where I work nights. Right, diver by day, hostess by night. You work hard. That brat Kenichi could show a little gratitude. I wanted a goat and end up with a sheep. Poor thing can't perform his task properly. - I'm starting to go crazy. - Your guy is inscrutable. - He was good before the marriage. - Well... He was surrounded by so many girls. Now he's a source of disappointment. He's become obsessive with cleanliness. He barely caresses me and I rarely feel more than the tip of his dick. Good evening! Anybody home? - Maki. - Hey, Mr. Director! What a surprise! What happened? It's been six months. But I kept thinking about your skin. Hey, it's you Rei-Chan. I heard you had a fight with Kenichi. You'll be lonely in your bed tonight. Easy, easy now! Hands off! No, don't worry. Come on, I'm trying to cheer her up. There, let me pour you one. Look at him, grandpa at his best. There, you drink this one and off you go. In the presence of two flowers. Hey, I'm so drunk. Hey, behave yourself! You can't sleep here. We'd rather not see your balls. Wake up please, Grandpa Piggy. Come on, wake up! What a drag. Don't pretend you're sleepwalking! I know you! Look at that frisky dick. Naughty boy. Tonight I'll let you have your way. Let me see you suck that finger. Doesn't it feel like an octopuses' arm? Huh? Now let's have your other mouth taste it. I can't wait anymore! Not yet! Let me tease you a bit more. Some more teasing. You like that? Not just yet. I know you're listening. How could you be so wet? You old goat! You'd like to shop around? Not on my watch! - I'm your deal today. - Hey, wait. Hey, go easy. Quietly. How about her? How about Reiko? No way, you're tightly trapped. Reiko. Ah, great! It was great! Kenichi, you idiot. You'll be to blame if I cheat on you. - The doctor? - She fell on a rock? The doctor is making his rounds and can't be reached. I was a stretcher-bearer in the war. Leave it to me. - Are you sure? - Just bring her over there. Good, you can still walk. Let her lie there. Let me see. Mr. Director, do you think she'll be OK? It's not a big wound. Just leave it to me. What are you all looking at. Just go back to work! Thank you for your help. The ocean cries when you leave her. Don't you move. Ouch. It hurts. It's such a pleasure to help a young person. Alright. You're all set now. - Thank you, sir. - You can't go yet. Just lie down a little more. - But... - Don't worry. We should seize this chance. I'll teach you something. - Teach me what? - Listen... You're still an apprentice diver, right? Right, and you probably don't earn much. I know how hard it is for you. - You can earn more. - Really? You're the only virgin among the divers. And that's why they treat you like that. My predecessor helped your mom when she was 15. My mom? Who cares about your mom... It's about you today. How would you like that, Natsu? No! No! Keep it down! Natsu. Would you like money? - No! No! - Here, I have some change. There, you can have it. You're happy? No! No! Natsu! Alright, then. Look here, 10.000 yen. For you. Are you happy? Natsu! Natsu! Are you happy? - You're hurting me! - Right, your wound. And soon, another place will be hurting. Oh, I just found cute little Pink Riding Hood... She uncovered her face for a kiss. No! Does it hurt? Alright. It hurts! Well? Did you enjoy it? Yes. This is... above my usual rate. What? Madam. Don't you feel lonely sometimes in this big house? I got used to it. You don't mind that your husband is away? Of course I mind. But Tokyo is just half an hour away. But you haven't seen him in two months. If my husband is away from me for just 3 days, I go crazy. I see him in my dreams. I'll get the door. - Hello, Madam. - Thank you. - Madam, I'll be going. - Thank you, see you tomorrow. - I left your money on the table. - Yes. It's always a pleasure. See the waves in the strait... The boat whistles in the distance... - A beer, please. - Yes. I'll take these. Really? So, you're not ready to apologize and come back. Nope. Listen, Mr. Cleanliness. Marriage is not just daily routine. Sex is important. Sex brings out the beauty in a woman. Hey! Do we need to have this conversation now? An orgasm is the peak of a woman's day. You get it? There's a lot you don't understand about women. Alright, let's go. Hey, I'm drinking. You take some time off, fine. But remember that you're my wife. If you cheat on me, I'll kill you! Hey! Hey! Kenichi, wait! Hi. He seemed upset. What did you say? Why would that be your business? Do you have to be so harsh with a friend? - Leave me alone. - I'm a good listener. - Hey there. - Huh? Come on. Are you not going back to your husband? He expects me to apologize before I go back. - You could swallow your pride. - What? - But you want him back. - How dare he? Really? So, then you won't mind? - Mind what? - Could you lend me Kenichi? Huh? - A little fling? - With my husband? Yes. You see... Before you married him, we had an affair. So now, if you're not using him... Alright? But... Look at your face. You really care for him. He's so shallow. So we're good? Good, I'll pounce on him tonight. - Pounce on him? - You don't mind? Reiko. Reiko. Hana-Chan! - Kenichi, I'm sorry. - I can't. - I like you! I like you! - No. Kenichi! You're so good. I needed this. - There. - Thank you. See you again. - Welcome. - A glass please. What happened? Kenichi, that asshole. - What happened today? - I'm not going back. Here you are. I'll have this and this. Come on, pull yourself together! What's wrong? Hold on to me. - I'm not going back. - I get it, I get it. You're a mess. Come on, stand up. - I won't go back. - No, you won't. Mind your step. Alright. Good. What? Are you alright? Do you feel sick? - I'm nauseous. - Rei-Chan. What are you doing? You said you don't wanna go back. So let me help you clear your head of your husband. We can spend the night together, right? Spend the night with you? Enough! No! No! Can your husband treat you like I do? Tell me? Aren't you about to forget about him? Stop talking about Kenichi. I've had many women in my life. But I never met anyone like you. Really? Come on, why would I lie? With you in my life... I'm sure I can accomplish great things. Tell me, do you have money? I see. The truth is, I'm short on cash. - So I'm gonna work? - Work? No way, I'm not having you work. - I don't mind. - I won't accept that. I didn't have that motive when I asked you out. But if we need money... Don't worry, I'll find something. Let's have a little more passion! Lift your legs! We need to see action! What are they doing? Your butt... Higher! Spread your legs higher up, there. Let me hear you. Be more aggressive on her breasts. Listen to me. Come on, move your hips. Alright, good... wriggle your butt. Don't tell me you can't do it. I want to hear you moan! Alright, good job. Hey. Yes. Boss, you see that young lady? Right. You always bring me top quality. Alright then, how about 30.000 yen? - 20.000. - 25.000. You're a tough businessman. Great, thank you. One, two, three, four... What? It's a loan. You'll have it back. That's too... - Are you complaining? - Oh, no... I'm good. Rey-Chan, he'll see you now. Hey, girls, are you taking a nap? More passion! - You'll be fine. - Come on, let's see. Boss, she's all yours. Alright then. You have a good body. My club offers eroticism. Let me see. You're great. Come this way. See the nose of that Tengu mask? You'll put that rubber on it without using your hands. You fit it nicely in your mouth. You stretch it this way. Hey, are you even looking? You do like that. The rubber... Hey, look here! You put it on it like this. This way, you see? You put it in all the way. With your mouth in one go. Hey, try it. Come on, it can't be difficult. Hey, don't be precious with me! Down the hatch, deeper! Right, that's it! - Kenichi, come. - Uh? What is it? Reiko is with Yoto. What? Where is she? She's in Chiba now. "Don't leave your garbage on the docks." Let my heart tell you that I drowned. I drowned in your love. Hey, I was looking for you. - Bastard, I want a word with you. - What? What do you want? You think you can take a man's wife? You don't get it. I tried to stop her from making a mistake... but she followed that weird guy. - Where is she now? - She's at the Pink Salon. Are you kidding me? Don't tell him I helped you find her. I'm indebted to that man! You're good at this. You're winning a lot. Ah, forgive me. You're so good at handling balls, I could trust you with mine. Try to send them here... Wow, that was close. Hey, it's in. Good, now tighten it. Good. Now tighten, good. Now tighten. Now move your butt. Yes, take it all in. That's good. Good, good, you're great. Good, tighten, tighten. Good, tighten. Now, tighten. Hey, what do you want? Get out! This is a private session! - What do you want, idiot? - This woman is my wife. Your wife? No way... Is that true? He's a liar! I'm not even married! - Reiko! - You heard her! - Now fuck off! - Reiko, please come back home! Are you dumb? I'll help you understand. You don't get it? You idiot! What do you think you're doing? What do you want? No! No! Just let me go! No! No! No! Let me go! What do you want? Let me get off! No! No! Let me get off! I'm not going back home. Shit! No. Let me go! Just leave me alone! What do you want from me? I cheated on you! I don't care! I'll wash it off! No! Because you... You are my wife! What? What do you want? Ah, they're here. - I like that one. - Which one? That one. That one. No, you can't have that one. Anyone but that one. I'm telling you, she's off limits. You can only enjoy her with your eyes.
