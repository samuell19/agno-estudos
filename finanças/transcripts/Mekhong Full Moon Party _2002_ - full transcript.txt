THIS FILM WAS INSPIRED BY AN ACTUAL PHENOMENON AND SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH. THE END OF BUDDHIST LENT DAY LAST YEAR Dear friends and visitors who have come to participate in this year's celebration of the Naga Fireballs Festival, Chumphon Municipal Office would like to extend a warm welcome to you all for the year 2001. All right. After the Naga Procession... The Naga Procession has already arrived at the ceremonial area. Next, we'll begin the worship ceremony for the Naga. Chumphon Municipal Office is delighted to welcome our dear visitors who have come to the event this year. In a few hours, we will all get to witness the Naga Fireballs Phenomenon, which occurs every year at the end of the Buddhist Lent Day at the watercourses of the Mekhong River in Nong Khai Province. After the sun has set for two to three hours, there will be fireballs the size of lemons that are red and orange in color, rising up from the Mekhong River into the air with ridiculous speed. Up to date, science has yet to prove what causes these fireballs. So we'll have to keep watching how many fireballs the Naga will throw out of the river as an offering this year. The people on both sides of the river have believed for a long time that the Mekhong River itself was created by the Naga, and so was the city of Vientiane. Also, it is believed that the Naga can create... For the Naga Fireballs, what do they look like when they go off? They shoot up like -balls of fire. -Yes. In the past, -it was not that high. -What else? However, at present, they can go up to -several hundred meters. -several hundred meters. It's about 20 meters long. It's 7 baht and 10 baht. We've got small ones as well. Small pictures are only 20 baht. Come on, everyone. It's a big one. It got caught in a fishing net. It's about 20 meters long. This one was caught by the American soldiers. Please come and see the Naga's footprints on the roof of the car. It's good to buy one as a souvenir. It's also good to buy it for your girlfriend. Step right up, everyone. Ma'am, how much are you going to bet this year? You little shit! Last year, you made me lose money. I couldn't sell anything all night. This year, you better stay far away from me! Naga is sacred. Go away, you brat. Go away. Go rip somebody else off. This year, the province has cooperated with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to organize this event... So, they're man-made, right? How the hell can the Naga know when the end of the Buddhist Lent Day is? As it gets closer to the time, I want all of you to watch the area in the middle of the river. Fireballs will shoot up as high as five to six stories of a building. And then, they will just disappear without smoke, scent, nor sound. It's here. Hurry up. The fireballs are about to go off. How the hell do you know when it will go off? Wow. Yes, everyone! It's not finished for today. There are some more. What a sight! If the Naga does exist under the water, please send the fireballs for us to see again. There, at the Luang Temple Pier. Another one just shot up! There's one more at the Jom Nang Temple Pier. It's really stunning! Well, I can rest in peace now. I've seen them with my own eyes. One just went up at Jom Nang Temple Pier! It's really beautiful, folks! From all of my research, we can certainly conclude that the Naga Fireballs Phenomenon is simply a natural phenomenon. It can be explained... Well, it's like this, ma'am. Suppose this boy's head is the sun, and this orange is Earth. Every year, this orange. Oh, no. This Earth will rotate around the sun like this. At the end of Buddhist Lent Day, it comes closest to the sun. Okay? This is the moon. It's here. Then, the forces from the sun and the moon suck up the methane gas up, creating the Naga Fireballs. Suck it right up, Doctor? Yes, it's like when your husband gave you a hickey on the neck. Hey, Doctor. Why do we see fireballs only in Nong Khai? Why don't we see any in Udon Thani or Ubon Ratchathani provinces? In that area, there are plenty of dead cows and buffalos. -Come this way. -Okay. -Where to, Doctor? -Come here and have a look. Look. For the Naga Fireballs to go off, the riverbed must be sandy to allow the methane to discharge. The riverbed around Thai Temple in Ponpisai District is perfect for that. Wow. You're really smart. If there's rain or thunderstorm, you will certainly see the Naga Fireballs after sunset. One important point is that there must not be any dam or water barrier built, no dredging of canals, nor can there be mining of the riverbed. Most importantly, the water in the area must not be polluted. What? He put the blame on my factory? Well, it's the doctor's assumption that your ketchup factory has caused the water to be polluted, so there haven't been any fireballs. He's right. Shit! Were there a lot of people listening to what the doctor said? When I first started this research, I thought it'd cost me only a few thousand baht. It has turned out that it has cost me tens of thousands. It's all right. I... as a son of Nong Khai, I will do my very best. Thank you. Please, go ahead. I want to ask you something. I want to know if you still believe in Buddhism? Sir. TEN DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE BUDDHIST LENT DAY Oh, my god! Oh, I'm sorry. I just wanted to tickle you. Hey, Khan. When did you get back? Why are you back so late this year? Don't you have a phone? You never called me. Venerable Father called to ask about you yesterday. Let's go. Get in the house. It's been raining every day. Is that the air-monitor device you wrote to me about? Be careful. Mrs. Oong will use it to dry the fish. Idiot. At first, I was afraid that she wouldn't let us keep it here. It belongs to your fianc√©, so why not? By the way, I'm sorry that I didn't come to your engagement party. I really couldn't make it. Don't be silly, Khan. By the way, I have moved your room to the small room in the front. I just painted it yesterday. For the old room, Doctor Norati wants to use it to keep his tools. I forgot to tell you this. Khan! What time did your bus arrive? You are soaking wet! Take some of the rainwater in the tank and rub it on your head three times. Do it quickly! You won't catch a cold. Right. Rub it all over. Good, just like that. Mrs. Oong, Alice is wet as well. What? -Alice is wet, too? -Alice is wet, too. Go! Rub it on her face three times. Hurry up! Hurry up! That will keep the cold away. Wow. A new cell phone. It's from the Prime Minister's company. When I go over to Venerable Father on Lao side, I'll try to call you, okay? Will you be home every day during the school break? Yes. Why do you ask? Last night, I dreamed about you. Actually, it was the night before because I was on the bus last night. I didn't get any sleep. Aunt Oong is always home. If Venerable Father wants anything, just call us. Well, I'm off then. Good luck. Wow! Little Khan has grown into a young man this year. You guys must be a couple since you came together. Who dropped you here? You must have a girlfriend, judging from your hair cut. Venerable Father would be happy to see you. -Yes. -That's a genuine American-style haircut. -No, it's not. -Oh, Khan is here. What did you bring? How's it going? We haven't seen you for so long. Oh, you are here. How is it going? Have you graduated this year? Wow! Those are fancy pants. How are you? Venerable Father, may I have a quick word with you? It's about money, right? You wouldn't be here otherwise. That's how kids are these days. There are many ways for them to blow their money. It's all right. Hey, it's going to rain again. Don't stand in the rain. You'll catch a cold. Let's go talk inside. This year, we have to prepare well in advance, just in case. This year, we have to use a special formula to make the colors even brighter than last year. It's also to produce... -Venerable Father. -two times more than before, so the audience won't be disappointed. Stop! This year, Venerable Father says we'll make the event bigger than ever. We'll produce more fireballs. But I'm afraid that we might not make it in time because we have fewer workers every year. Don't worry about my production. We should be more worried about setting up the fireballs. Last year, we made too many fireballs. Many were bad. We also placed them under the river too late because Khan was the only one left to do it. I've spoken with Monk Lod about the incubation time of the balls. It takes one full day. For example, last year, we started to set up the fireballs only a day before the end of the Buddhist Lent Day. The festival boats were practicing until late at night. Khan had to wait for them to leave before he could dive. By the time he was done, the sun was up and the roosters were crowing. Khan, there is more water and the current is stronger than last year. Be careful, son. I heard that the Naga hunters will set up nets to catch us. They will stay there all day. It's been like this for many days now. With your bad luck, you might get snared in their nets when you dive in the water. Venerable Father! I think it's time we stop. Really, it's time. Let's stop it. It's not some annual or district festival anymore, Venerable Father. Have you ever taken a good look on the other side of how many TV channels they have? Khan, can I ask just once more? Just get us through this year. Do it to satisfy everyone who are waiting in anticipation. Do you know that people from many provinces all gather here? Please don't, Venerable Father. If we're going to stop, let's just stop it. I think our parishioners would be furious if they knew what you did with their donations. How do you know they will get mad? They would be thrilled to see the fireballs. You're talking nonsense. Are you drunk? Now, you're drinking in the temple? I'm not as drunk as those tourists, who always throw their trash along the river in front of our house. Venerable Father, have you seen what they leave behind? Venerable Father. If what we do is really good and would earn us merits, then why did Kem die when he went down with me? Venerable Father, he died. Kem died because he was drunk. I told him repeatedly that if he wanted to dive, he shouldn't drink. He died because of alcohol. Venerable Father, do you remember his mother's face the day we cremated him? Venerable Father, someone is going to catch us someday. Do you know the news channel called ITV? I'm really scared of them. If people find out what's going on, they will lose faith in our religion. Don't worry, Khan. The Naga has chosen us. He will protect us. Nobody can do us any harm. On top of that, we will get merits by helping people to see the fireballs and fill up their hope. We make them believe and make them see what we do. They will be even happier as if seeing the Lord Buddha. I think I'd better leave if you're talking about the Lord Buddha. Have you ever heard of the saying "Believe in what you do, do what you believe in"? Do you think that if there were no fireballs, will people still pay respect to the monks? If there were more fireballs, will people pay more respect to the monks? So, Bangkok has taught you to be aggressive like this? So, you want an old monk to beg you, do you? If yes, I'll prostrate myself before you right now! I'm sorry, Venerable Father. I'm no longer a child, who believes about the Naga transforming into a human. Have you seen the people who say they believe in the Naga? They bet on the number of fireballs. Now, do you still believe such belief makes merits? Stop talking. Don't you know that he can hear everything you say? -It's good. -Everything must be proven these days, Village Chief Aod. It has to be precise and accurate. In no time, they'll prove if it will rain when red ants carry eggs in their mouths. -Ma'am, there are ants on my drinks! -When a gecko makes a sound, is that bad luck or just air pressure in their throat? This doctor here was a student of mine and now he's trying to disprove the Naga! Teacher. The doctor will hear you. This apparatus of mine has been perfectly set up. I have heard a good one. It's better than the one about ants. What is it? It's a way... to stop a dog from taking a shit. It's just an old story -that an old monk once told me. -All right, just get to the point. Well, if you see a dog about to shit in front of your house, just hold out a loincloth like this and wring it out. The dog won't be able to shit. That's all. -Just a little, Chief. -Come on. Everyone now believes you. Just a second, Chief. -What is it? -Just relax for a second. I'm going to put a stainless steel spoon in here. In less than three minutes, those ants will march out in a single file like soldiers. It's because they're afraid of stainless steel spoons. I think they're more afraid of getting whacked with the spoon. You're a real comedian, Chief. -Alice. -Yes? Come down and hang these clothes for me. It's been raining every day, They're getting all mildewy. Are you done? Get me some of that rice broth in the kitchen for me as well. Is that rice broth for the dog? It's for soaking the laundry to get out ironing stains. Yesterday, while I was ironing, I realized that I hadn't collected the data for Dr. Norati, so I ran outside and forgot about the ironing. After that, I smelled something burning. Wow, you are helping Dr. Norati. Come on, Headmaster. I just write it down like how it does for the water meter. If I forget to do it, I'd just make a rough guess. You're so sarcastic, just like a woman. Why is it so good? If things are lost, we have to look for them, don't we? -Thank you. -If they're broken, we have to fix them. -Aunt Oong, she's really something! -Yes. I bought her a washing machine because she might be tired, but she never even uses it. How can a washing machine know which spot is the most dirty -Yes. -or where to scrub? It's like that machine to catch the Naga, or whatever. If your mother was still alive, there's no way she'd let you do this. As for Venerable Father, your dad, there's definitely no way. Right, ma'am? You're getting serious again. Her mother and father love the doctor. He loves to talk about religion with Venerable Father. Why wouldn't he let him set it up here? Alice, don't listen to the Headmaster too much. I didn't say Dr. Norati is a bad man. Come on, Oong. Are you afraid we're going to find the truth behind the Naga Fireballs? You also teach science, right? Are you afraid the Naga isn't the one creating the fireball? Alice, what are you saying? Hey, where are you going? THERE'LL BE MORE FIREBALLS THAN EVER. What are you doing? It's all right. Yes. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. You're mean for laughing at the kid. Come on, when I was a child, I was never afraid. That kid doesn't know or what? Look, you can see the legs right there. Well, those kids really believe that it does exist. I myself believed so when I was a kid. Come on, Alice. Don't get mad, Alice. Ouch! Help me! Help! You're not mad at me anymore, right? No, I just think you're nuts! Give me some more. Come here. Come here quickly. Ouch! It's flying! Hey, baby. Come here. Come back here. Alice, how can you tell which one is male or female? I once saw it on Channel 11. They said you have to spread their butts to find out, right? -Are you crazy? -Hey, come here. -You city kids know nothing. -Come and look. This way, Alice. Watch and learn, Doctor. If it stays still, it's a male. If it shakes its feathers, it's a female. See? Women like to do things like that. Doctor, I have a stomachache. I'm in so much pain, Doctor. It happens once a month. Do you think my period is coming, Doctor? Hey. Hey, you're a female. A woman! What are you doing, Doctor? I'll prescribe some medicine for you. -Okay. -Now tell me where it hurts. Do you need me to wash these? No. It's a woman's job. I can't let you do that. There's really nothing I can help you with? Okay, then... help me check the test papers. I thought you would never ask. CHUMPON PONPISAI KINDERGARTEN A long time ago, when Buddha came to the Mekhong River, he stayed at Pu Luang. Luang is an ancient word that means Naga. Buddha saw a Naga named Phaya Puppalanak. The Naga was wearing a jeweled sash and stuck his tongue out. Buddha smiled and predicted that this site would become the city of Nong Khai in the future. Nagas are often mentioned in many teachings about Buddhism. For example, before enlightenment, there was this Naga who was guarding Buddha's golden serving tray and Nairanjana River. When Buddha was trying to achieve enlightenment, he sat down under a tree. One day, there was a heavy downpour, a Naga named Muchalin coiled himself and spread his hood to protect Buddha from the rain. Khan! It's raining. The test papers are getting blown away! I'm sorry! Did you find it? What? You're getting old. You have already have gray hair. You're so rude. Let me see yours. Oh, you have a lot of gray hair. Hey, don't fool me. It won't work. You little brat. Why do we even have tests? Do you really want to know, or are you just joking? I'm serious. Well... It's to measure the results of how well one student has gone through the process of learning-- To learn if that student believes the teacher or not, right? That's a joke. In reality, we have to believe in textbooks. It means that if I'm a student and I don't believe the teachers, I'd fail, right? If that's the case, should I leave before I fail or should I fail first and then leave? Where is it? Give me the hair. After the rain, it always floods. Do you see that? I'm going to burn them and smoke the centipedes. Just now, when I went upstairs to put up a mosquito net, I saw a huge centipede like this on the pillow. I'm going to smoke it out. It will get drunk in this smoke and crawl away. Not just centipedes, even people can't stand that smoke. Sniff it. Hey, Khan. When are you going to see Venerable Father on the other side? Not yet. I still don't feel well. I have a sore throat. It's nothing much. I just want to send that box over to him with you. Venerable Father left it with me. I don't even know what it is. The other day, I left it in the house, and that damn cat pissed on it. What a cat! Soon, I'm going to rub his ass in the dirt. It keeps pissing here and here. Is something wrong, Khan? Are you having problems with Venerable Father? THERE WILL BE MORE FIREBALLS THAN BEFORE If you knew that those fireballs were man-made, what would you do? Would you be angry at them? I'd be angry, of course. I'd be really angry. I mean, that's openly deceiving the public. If I knew, I'd call the police and have them arrested. Why? Do you know who's doing this? How could they do this? Are you sick, Khan? Go get yourself some medicine. Otherwise, you'll get Aunt Oong's remedies. Here you go. I saw you sneezing. Take this. It's sticky rice water. I soaked the rice since this morning and want to give you the puree to relieve the cold. Here. Yes, drink the whole thing. Everything. NORATI CLINIC MYSTERIOUS TRAILS NAGA'S TRAILS DISCOVER NAGA'S POWER Hey, son. Why are you getting involved... in this Naga stuff? Those villagers will be pissed at you. You're also weak. Mom. Just what did the villagers say? Judy's daughter named Nee has already been saying that she won't buy anything from our shop. She said you have disgraced our religion. Come on, Mom. You want your name in National Geographic. Mom, this is getting out of hand now. How could you even listen to them? Oh, Mom. National Geographic isn't so bad, is it? After four years of conducting research on this topic, today, I can conclude that the Naga fireball phenomenon is the work of humans. I have something for you. DEFYING NORATI'S THEORY BY DR. SURAPOL SAKDIKUL AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH This is the Mekhong River in the area of Nong Khai Province. MEKHONG RIVER To go into detail, the current has a flowing rate of 1.75 meters per second at the occurrence of the phenomenon. EXPERIMENT NO. 120541 THE SPEED OF MEKHONG RIVER This means that if I happened to fall into the river at that time because of my stupidity, and if during such time, you accidentally stepped on the foot of a famous politician's son, I would have already floated to the other side before you could even pull your foot back. "Help. Help. Please help me, Doctor." Also, in the riverbed, there are no crevices where dead bodies can accumulate. Let's say if there was to be an accumulation, it would take time to accumulate the organic matters for up to five days in order to generate methane gas. What does this mean? This means that the Mekhong River must take a vacation to stop flowing for five days. Hey, Dr. Surapol. How do you know that there are no crevices there? Right there, Dr. Surapol. The water is so deep and murky like iced tea. -Hey! That's my ear. -Oh, what's wrong? You stick it in so deep. I'm sorry. Hey, Mr. Curious. Come here. What else do you want me to look at? If the riverbed was cavernous, -Yes. -we'd see the current spinning like this. Wow. That's right, Dr. Surapol. Wow, look at this. Oh, my god. For methane gas to shoot up, it must first ignite, which would cause a loud explosion. Hey, I'm still okay. The most important point is, It's impossible for methane gas to be ignited at 526 degrees Celsius in the Mekong River with a strong current at the end of Buddhist Lent Day. That's quite high. Think about it. Normally, the boiling water that our wives would use to make a spicy hot pot is only 100 degrees Celsius. When your wife lifts up the lid, you'd get a blast of heat enough to burn your face. You'd see the smoke no matter what. What the chief said about Dr. Norati going so far as to dive into the Mekhong River to collect soil and decomposed materials and test it in a laboratory on the night of the phenomenon is even more impossible with a depth of 10 meters. If Dr. Norati wasn't at least as strong as an Olympic swimmer, I don't think he would dare risk it. Even worse, within the murkiness of the water during the high tide season and the temperature at 526 degrees Celsius, don't you think that his part down there would be cooked? You might as well cook it in the spicy soup, Dr. Norati. In conclusion, I'm more than certain that this phenomenon is the work of human hands... whether it be by Laos or Thais. Well, you'll have to find out yourselves. Hey, I don't understand. Who are they? Who are they? I don't know what Naga means. Also, I don't understand why people don't like me. -They make a big fuss out of this. -I don't understand. -I don't really get it, too. -Same here. Sheriff, think about it. I was born and raised here. I also studied here. I have always made good merits. I never sold drugs. I donate to charities and make them posters during the New Year. Think about it. I set up this factory for farmers to sell their tomatoes. I've never cut the price. Last year, when market prices dropped, I was screwed. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't understand why the pro-Thai government imports tomatoes to sell them at a very high price, and they can still sell. Mine are labeled with "Made in Thailand," and they are boycotted because there were no fireballs and it became a disgrace to the community. I don't get it. -I don't get it, either. -Tee. Hey, Tee. Do you hear me? Hey, Tee. Go tell the doctor tomorrow morning. Oh, tell Dr. Surapol to make the Naga Fireballs and set them off in front of Jengwilai Factory. Whatever it costs, I'll pay. We have to let them know that there are fireballs here just like elsewhere. I don't get it. Announcement. It's now 12.30 p.m. All the division leaders please gather at the library for the meeting. Doctor, my friend is a Naga. He provides us with water. Shit! Goddamn it! What are you doing? What are you looking for? There's a dead mouse here. His spirit must be wandering nearby. Well, Dr. Norati just came by to ask the kids to help collect data, right? Yes, I already gave him permission. He installed two more machines. They're out at Nong Kung and Luang Temple Pier, He asked the students who live there to help him collect data. Why the hell did I help him? I'm really dumb. Why has globalization reached Nong Khai so quickly? Son of a bitch. I'm sorry. -Ms. Alice. -Yes? Actually, I don't give a damn if it's natural or created by man. Ms. Alice, if there are no fireballs in the Ponpisai District this year, Dr. Norati must be held responsible. Khan's been gone since yesterday. Why didn't anyone tell me? No one knew, Venerable Father. He left early in the morning. He shouldn't have acted like that. You took care of him since he was little. Without you, he'd be an orphan. He'd be a loser. Don't talk about gratefulness, all right? It's not relevant. We raised him to live a life. Whatever he has decided is... If that's the case, we would have to let go, Venerable Father. Whatever is going to happen, just let it happen. Why would we do that? It's our duty to help ensure that there is religion in this world. How are we going to help? The only people who know where to place the fireballs are only you and Khan. Ngum has disappeared -and Kem-- -I know now. Khan has to come and help us. How are you going to convince him? Religious precepts are not about lighting incense and praying with monks. Then what is? Venerable Father. Have you come for the anniversary of Kem's death? I've already done it. Where is Khan? You can go inside, Venerable Father! There's no one home! I can't let go of my hands, Venerable Father. I can't let go, either. Thank you. If we could collect data on the density of oxygen throughout the year, -Yes. -in one more year, we could definitely confirm that Naga Fireballs are indeed created by a natural phenomenon. -I really feel grateful to the chief. -Yes. He worked hard to raise funds to carry out the research. So, what's the progress? -We're almost there. -Okay. There are many obstacles to set up this equipment. It was difficult. Things are much easier now because Alice and Mrs. Oong are helping with the data collection. They told me that Khan was also helping. Oh, where is Khan today? Khan? I haven't seen anyone since I arrived, but... Mrs. Oong should be home soon. Maybe you can ask her yourself. Why do people want to know the secrets of nature? Why do they want to know? Venerable Father. That's the religious enigma. We want to unlock the secrets to better understand nature. Once we understand it, we'll live on Earth with happiness. The west is the opposite of the east. The west is all about material things. The east is about the mind. Science is for all people on the planet. It's similar to your sermons. Buddhist faith teaches us not to believe without reason. One second in the heart of each person is not the same. Wow. Your words are so sharp. I can't argue with you. Let's put it this way. Please bless me to be successful, Venerable Father. Believe in what you do. Do what you believe in. Black Label! That's a great line. One more time, please. Are we ready? One, two, three. I shouldn't have done all these. All right. Can you hear me? I'm on the bank of the Mekhong River in Ponpisai District and this is the experiment No. 3-2545. Hey, hold the camera straight. I can't see the script. We're at the place where the Naga Fireballs appear to prove that the phenomenon is not a miracle as what people believe. It's man-made. Hold the sign well. You're slithering like a snake. Did the Naga take over your body, you lizard? These are the firecrackers that are popular in Nontaburi. They're made from an explosive charge and special wires. It's simple to use. We only have to ignite and let the charge run along the wire. If we watch them from far away in the dark, we won't be able to see the wires. Most of the Naga Fireballs occur near the Lao side, which is far from here in total darkness. On the contrary, for my firecrackers, these wires are tied horizontally. I'll demonstrate this for you. Hey, light it, you stupid. Asshole. As for the Naga Fireballs, the trick is to run the wire vertically from beneath the water. Let's say that at the end of the Buddhist Lent Day I prepare fireballs beneath the water with these wires installed at the side of the Mekhong River all the way to the shore. When the time is near, I'd sit back and relax with a Lao beer. When it's time, I'd press the button. -What do you think? -That's awesome. -This time, -Yes. it doesn't have to be the end of the Buddhist Lent Day. Yes. It could be any day, whether it be the National Chicken Day, International Dog Shit Day, -your Mother-in-law's Day, -Hey. or the day your father-in-law died. Yes. If you have this remote control, the wires and the special firecrackers that can ignite underwater, -Yes. -we can create the Naga Fireballs -whenever we want. -Yes. What's next? Oh, you have to press it. -Press it? -Yes. Sure! Shoot it! Shoot! Even David Beckham can't shoot like this! Hey, what the hell happened? What the hell happened? What is it? -Hey! -What the hell is wrong? Hey, the real Naga Fireballs don't make a sound like this. This one does. -Dr. Surapol, you son of a bitch! -How is this possible? -Such a waste of time. -It's impossible. This is impossible. Give me the laptop, Wit! -All right. -How is this possible? Well. When we tested it in the swamp, it worked great. What the hell happened today? Hey, can you check to see if the temperature is stable? Yes, definitely, but today the water was too cold and you talked a little too long. You're now putting the blame on me. You smart ass. -Go get the temperature chart. -Okay. How can this be? I made this with my own hands. I worked fucking hard on this. How could it go wrong? I don't believe this. What the hell are you still filming? Go away. Hey, my little kitty. You've got me working first thing in the morning. You see? You don't know where to piss. You even pissed near the holy stuff. I'm going to send your ass to some temple, Kitty. You really are too much! Don't look at me like that. You better watch out! You're going get it, Kitty. Each day, I don't get any work done. All I do is clean up your piss and shit. Piss here. Shit there. Piss here. Shit there. Piss here. Shit there. Can you remember that? Hey, Khan. Put it over there. Watch out for splinters. You've been in Bangkok for so long. Your hands must have gone soft. -Don't worry about him. -Yes, that's right. There are splinters in Bangkok as well. In Bangkok, he must have done a lot of poking. Chicken. Oh, really? -It's finished? -Hey. Won't you give me one? -What's wrong with him? -What's it this time? Wait. Is this the map to Granny Maha's treasure, or what? Did it get taken out of the garbage? There was some spit all over it. Listen. It's not a treasure map. It's the plan for the regatta. It's a bit wrinkled. I see. -I was working on it at Jek Hua's shop. -Yes. That bastard turned on the TV so loud. -Hey. -Yes. I couldn't work at all. So instead, I got engrossed in the fight on TV and started cheering. -Yes. -Then, the coffee fucking spilled all over the damn thing. -What are you doing? -Hey. How's it? Is it faster than last year? -You have to get first place. -What I meant is -that this year... -This year what? -Hello. -The regatta has -to be better. Got it? -Hello. Yes. Hey, do you hear me? -Hello. -This dude got it in. -Yes, that book. -Don't let it go off. Okay. Hey, Bueng. Can you send me EMS? Asshole! What? Hello! -Hello! -Hey. -Hello. What? -Hey, Dr. Norati! Hurry up! Let's drink. Right now, we're still working on the regatta. -There's no signal. -Hey. Hoi. -Go help him. Hurry up! -To do what? Come here. Where? He's drunk. -Can we go up? -Go up. -Do you see it? -I'm pushing you here. I got it. Quick! It's a 24-hour free call. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Watch this! I'm going to scratch the bottom, so that the bottle can be opened easily. Did you see that? Let's all drink until we get so drunk We're not going anywhere Unless they kick us out LOOKPAEW RIM KHONG That guy talks too much shit Just looking at him pisses me off But who would realize That my friend is heartbroken He said that the angel... -Oh, this is really delicious. -It's delicious. -So delicious. -What kind of salad is that? -I don't know. -It's so hot. -Doctor. -Hi. -It's hot, isn't it? I have a cool trick. -Okay. Put your face down and stick out your tongue. You'll start to drool. After the third drop has fallen, -Yes. -you'll feel better. That's Mrs. Oong's theory. Two have dropped. It's the third one now. It's not getting any better. Can I just spit it out? Hey, if you're going to puke, do it outside. Don't do it here. It's dirty. Get out. Phong, who do you think I am? You're Ultraman. You're wrong. I'm the Dutch Mill logo. Do you see my windmill? Oh, yes! Hey, all you sinners. Help me lift this mast up, will you? How about we lift your dick? Hey, let's go help him lift the mast up. -Quick. -Okay. Alice told me that you're a singer with a golden Adam's apple. I just witnessed it today. You're not bad at all. You're good enough to release a CD. I'm into country music. Yes, I liked "Tears of a Hyena" out of all your songs. It was beautiful. I liked that song. No, Dr. Norati. It was water, not tears. It's actually called "Sad Dog" by Kaew Laithong. Oh, really? Are you a football fan, Doctor? Yes. Alice told me that you're a Manchester United fan. Are you one of their fans too? Of course. It hurts to admit that they lost to Liverpool five games in a row. Exactly. So did she tell you that I'm addicted to soap operas? She didn't tell me that. She only told me that you like her. What? Hey, I won't say anything. It's okay. You can like her. You've known her since you were little. I've only known her for a couple of years. You can like her, really. You can also look at her if you please. However, if you hit on her, I'll smack you! Well... I'm not intending to hit on her. Alice is like an older sister to me. But if I get a girlfriend, I would want it to be someone like her. You swear? Don't even think about hitting on her. -I won't. -That's good. We are the men with pants Traveling the world We are the men with pants Hey, Dr. Norati. It's dog's shit! What's so bad about it? What has it ever done wrong? Be careful. I'm really jealous of you, Doctor. Ever since I have had Alice, I don't really need anything else. What about your experiment? Oh, right. I forgot. Another thing is my experiment. I forgot. Yes, that's true. Doctor. I can just look at Alice, can I? Hey, Doctor! Hey, Khan. Don't grill it yet. Wait until the grill is really hot first, so it won't stick to the grill. If my old hag found out, she'd kill me. You prick! They said you've seen the Naga. Is that all a lie or what? You didn't lie, right? Khan, you asshole. How could you say that? We'll all be damned. Go ask Venerable Father if it's true. He's seen it, too. These days, our hearts are tainted. We can no longer make contact with the Naga. Does that mean that the Naga lived among us in human form? Tai, go and take a look at the ancient temples on both sides of the Mekhong. I don't know how many temples there are. About three or four generations ago, a group of artisans, who had faith in the Naga, came to build these temples. They are full of Naga images. We don't know where these artisans came from. Once they were finished building the temples, they simply disappeared. Khan, you dick! You scared me. Don't joke around with this. Don't ever make fun of what you can't see. Damn you! Yes. Sorry, Tai. I was chasing the flies. I thought you said to light three candles and the flies will go away. You light the candles like a horror show on TV. Who made this chili sauce? Why is it so sour? -Jeez! -You asshole! Have you and you guys ever heard about the novice named Nguen? He lived in Sakon Nakhon Province with an old monk. There was a cave behind the temple. The old monk kept telling him not to enter the cave. As for the novice Nguen, the warning went through his ears. One day, when the old monk wasn't there, the novice sneaked into the cave. There, he met another novice waiting for him, so they went inside together. When they walked in, they kept going... endlessly for a long time. For Nguen, he was afraid that the old monk would scold him. So thinking the old monk would return soon, he said he would go back to the temple. The mysterious novice disappeared right in front of him. Not sure of what happened, Nguen fainted. A while later, there was a blanket covering him and he appeared in another place in a villager's fishing net. That means that the cave had to be really deep, right? It's from Sakon Nakhon Province to the Mekhong River. Khan. People said the naval of Mekhong River is at the Ahong Rapids, which is the deepest point of the entire Mekhong River. Whoever gets drowned above the rapid will all be found dead and floating around at Ahong Rapids. Hey! Hey, be careful! Each of those fireballs costs a lot. This is an experiment to shoot off a fake fireball to the bottom of Mekhong River at coordinates 4.44. Quickly! Hurry up, fatso. Yes, you. I'd kick your ass if you were close by! You asshole! Quick. Look, dark clouds are coming in. We'll lose all our marks. This time, we've come really close. These guys will plant the bamboo sheaths at the bottom of the river. This time, the fireballs will shoot up just like the real thing. Maybe the ones behind it are just fishermen. Whoever they are, I think they're great! Look at how strong the current during the rainy season is. Where we're standing now is where most of the fireballs shoot up. Hey, who the hell are they? I really want to get to know them. Where did they get the money to do this? Are they so rich? Let's get them and poke their butts. What's wrong? What happened to Wit? What's wrong with him? Pull him up. Hey, take off his oxygen tank first. Shit! What happened to you, Wit? -Hey, Wit. -Wit. WELCOME TO PONPISAI DISTRICT, THE CITY OF NAGA FIREBALLS I have been studying this giant snake for 34 years. KRITCH POSAPIWAT, PHD SUPERNATURAL SCIENTIST Reptiles like pythons and boa constrictors, I've handled them all. However, I have never met a huge black snake with a crest and red eyes that the villagers call Naga. I've been to all the places where there were trails of the Naga. At most, I found only strange footprints like these. It's the same for today. It's not Naga, right? I don't know what it is, but I've come across prints like this quite often around here. In 1993, there was a couple from Udon Thani Province selling fruits around Thai temples. In the evening, they went to see the Naga Fireballs and talked in a disrespectful manner. In the morning, there was a print like this in front of their car. Then, the two of them just vanished. Yes. I heard them saying that this couple went into the ditch before they reached home. Oh, those poor souls. This was also the print found on a car hood in 1993. They said that the owner had so much faith in it and worshipped it. It gave him luck which made him win millions in the lottery. This is a print found in a house. The owner had shut his house up to escape floods for many months. When he returned, he found these prints all over. What's more important is that the whole place smelled like reptiles. This is a print in a fishpond. We often find a lot of these. This is the print on a grass field where the owner said to have been cut off by a Naga. I went to visit the owner. The poor guy lost his marbles. I mean, he's gone. Look at this one taken by a Navy officer. He took it from the ship dock. When he took the picture, he saw nothing. However, when he developed it he saw the Naga with a yellow crest. I examined the film myself. They didn't touch it up or anything. I'm from Done Village. I came here to cremate my cousin over there. I took a boat. When I arrived in front of the village, I saw rays of light shooting from the water. I think it was a Naga. It was definitely a Naga. It was a big snake with one eye. It lost an eye from a stick of dynamite set off by a fisherman. It came up to the surface of the Mekhong over there. Very scary. It's the same one. Exactly. Usually, we'd see it swimming back and forth between the dock at Chumpon Temple and the mouth of Done Village around noon. Just say it. Naga exists only as myth, because if it did exist, I'd have found it over the last thirty years. Today, miracles occur almost every day. Do you believe it or not? Even as I was driving here, it happened. I stopped and bought grilled bananas for 15 baht. I covered a mile and a dog cut in front of my car. I hit the brakes and things went flying. When I picked up the bag of bananas, shit! There were only 4 left. Is that a miracle or what? I'm not going to follow your advice. That's crazy! Why would I move my factory? How am I wrong? Okay, if you've transformed into a Naga, I'd be more screwed! It's all right. I'll go and catch the people who make the fake fireballs for you to see. I don't know. Is nature trying to tell us something? Kem! Kem. Kem. You went to a brothel, right? No wonder there have been weird smells recently! -Don't talk back at me! -They fight every day. All our money goes right -into pussies. -Ouch! It hurts. Come here! Come here! -I swear I didn't. -I don't believe you. Monks are riding the tricycle. Hey, shit! Hurry up! It's going to rain! What's taking you so long? It's going to rain! Where is everyone? Hey, where is everyone? It's going to rain soon! Bring all the clothes inside! Okay. Quiet. Bring the clothes inside! Take this first. Doctor. What do you need to prepare? Do I have to boil water? Hey. Venerable Father isn't giving birth. Are you crazy? My eyes hurt. Could you look at them for me, Doctor? His body is burning. How could you let it be like this? We gave him two packs of pills. I'll give him the saline solution. Can you find me something to hang it on? Oh, it's hot in here! It's hot. Yes, use the saline solution. That saves us oil. Hey, put everything away quickly. Someone's coming. Hey, cover it with cloth. Put it here. Hey, when did he sneak in? The water has just come up, so we use the boat to pick you up. Be careful. You can use the steps on the riverbank. I see. Doctor. If you come back here next time, we'll open the temple and let you pay respect to the holy images in there. But today, Venerable Father took the keys with him. I see. If I were to come back here all by myself, I'd definitely get lost. If I didn't have a meeting, I'd stay longer. -I see. -It's beautiful here. Doctor, the boat has arrived. What is this? Listen, Doctor. It rained all day yesterday. Everything got soaked, so I buried them in ashes here for it to, well... for it to suck up the humidity. What got wet? Matches. What's this? Look at this. What is it, Khan? I broke the university swimming records two months ago. Wow, that's great! You're good. It's hard to find someone to beat me now. Good, you're on your way up. Khan. Don't blame Venerable Father. He's really determined. Venerable Father has more faith than anyone else, Khan. The other night, a novice monk saw Venerable Father sitting out there in the rain all by himself because he wanted to see you, Khan. Calm down, Khan. Slowly explain everything to him. He deserves that at the very least because he has raised you -since you were little. -Hey, who's there? Can you burn some dried orange peel to chase the mosquitoes away? You're ill. What are you doing out here in the dark? The goods are old. The man is old. The light is gone. I want to see some of those fireballs for the last time. Before the full moon, there'll be just the Mekhong River. I know you're stressed, but I would like to beg you. If you weren't a monk and you went to Bangkok to the real world like me, you would understand -that this world of ours today... -Let me guess. Bangkok has developed at a very fast pace. Everybody has access to the Internet. They know everything. There are 60 TV channels. There is nothing the modern world can't do. I accept your reasons. Faith is out of fashion now. I can't go to this world of yours. In my world, I can't leave the Naga. I can't just let it remain as a fairy tale. If we don't do this, what will those people who come to see the fireballs think if there's none? I do it to serve our faith. Is that wrong? I only want the people of Nong Khai to feel good once a year. Anyway, whether it's good or evil, happy or sad, it's your choice to make... because this is the kind of job with no employer. I don't even have the right to control you. Goodness is truly in your own hands. You can go looking for it from the sky to heaven if you like. It's up to you. Go home, my son. Your world is calling after you. Go. Go! Come on. I'm telling you to go! Khan. How long do you think you'll be happy in Bangkok? Khan. We'll set up the fireballs the day after tomorrow. If you change your mind, we'll be waiting. Hey, Khan. Why are you sitting here alone? Hey, what's wrong? Got chili in my eyes. You got chili in your eyes? Hey. Come here. Roll your pants up. Salt. Lick it. The pain will go away. It's true, sir. I saw it clearly. I saw it with my own eyes. Venerable Father, the father of Alice, is the one making the fireballs for sure. I didn't make it up. I've been curious for a long time. What kind of monk comes to refill oxygen tanks? There's no such kind. It's here. I saw it with my own eyes. Hey, what's the matter? Excuse me, Venerable Father. Hey. Why is it like this? Doctor, it's Alice here. I have been searching for you. I have some bad news. Well... Your oxygen measuring device was destroyed by pig feces last night. We still don't know how badly damaged it is. Shit. Judging from the condition, I'd say this thing is damaged for good. However, I also have good news. I'm not sure if it's good, though. We found the suspect's watch on the ground near the fence. It must be why the dogs were barking. Afterwards, we caught the suspect as he was breaking into Dr. Surapol's car. More importantly, we found some files of yours buried in the same area. I'd like you to come to the station for an interrogation. Okay. Who... Who did that? Fuck. Doctor. Will those fireballs shoot up on the night of the full moon this year? I have relatives coming from Bangkok to see them. Well... Yes, they will. DATA RECORDING So you admit to all these charges, right? Yes, I did it, but don't you try to make me use the word "confess." I'm not confessing because I didn't do anything wrong. It's goddamn funny that I have to answer my junior's questions like this. Shit! Come on, sir. This is a criminal case. Yes, I know. You little brat. Are you really sure that what I did here is wrong? What about those things that the crazy-ass university professors and doctors did to the Naga? Why was it right? Those scientists are just trying to show how great they are and that they are humankind's new gods. You made me really screwed. Doctor. If I were to be jailed, will you give the Naga back to the villagers? VENEREAL I'm so confused today, Alice. I'm really confused. I didn't know what to say. Fuck it. Doctor. Please don't use that kind of language in front of a lady. If the Headmaster knew how much that machine costs, he'd be speechless. More speechless than me. The Headmaster is damn serious. Earlier this afternoon, his wife called me to thank me for not pressing charges against him. Do most people really think like the Headmaster and that we're the crazy ones? If we can't trust in science, I guess I can't be a doctor. Doctor, are you going to continue your experiments? Don't do it. It's too much of a hassle. Hearing you talk like this makes me feel like I don't have the strength anymore. I'm sorry. Bang! Doctor. Bang! Venerable Father. Hey, learn to respect the Naga! How did Venerable Father do it? Doctor, can you not say anything bad right now? Hey. I was giving a compliment. I was saying that Venerable Father is good at chemistry. Where's Khan, auntie? Khan packed his bags and went out just this evening. I don't know why he was in such a hurry. Lent isn't even over yet. Does this mean you haven't seen him? Is he leaving on tonight's bus? He said that he'd go pay a visit to Kud Khan Temple before leaving. I don't understand why he had to go so late at night like this. Tie it well so it won't fall off. THREE DAYS BEFORE THE FULL MOON Keep it well. It's not ours. Don't let it flow away. Tie it. Tie it well. I tied it well. Don't worry. Yes, that's better. I haven't listened to the news at all. I wonder what's going on now. Venerable Father, forget the news. It's time to make a decision. We have everything prepared. So, in the end, it's just me all alone, right? That's not it, Venerable Father. For this year, the fireballs we made are the type that has to be set up in the water three days in advance, but I don't know if Khan... Let's forget about him. We have to drop these fireballs in water before 11 p.m. tonight if you'd like them to go off at the end of the Buddhist Lent. Let's wait for Khan first. How do you know he'll come? It's a premonition, you know? Venerable Father. Maybe we should take the risk by dropping the fireballs from the boat. The current is too strong. If we do, the waves will sweep them away. It'd be great if one in ten goes off because we have made more than other years. No. Venerable Father, what about hiring Song to drop them? He's the guy who dives for old stuff to sell anyway. This is a secret. No one should know, or else the secret will get leaked out and it will be on TV. Wouldn't that ruin everything? We'll just wait for Khan. All right. We'll wait, then. While waiting, let's put all the things in the boat. Khan will be here. Look, we're going to see him to ask him... How are we going to tell him? I think it'll help. I think Khan wants to speak with someone. I think he wants to see you, Alice Yes, that day. I can remember it now. The other day, Khan asked me something regarding this. Hey, could it be that last year's Naga Fireballs were the last? Hey. Where are you going? Hey. Hey. What's up? We know everything now, Khan. Take me to the police. No, Khan. It's not like that. You don't have to comfort me. So, Venerable Father is the one... I'm sorry, Khan. That day... I didn't have the right to anything about those who made the fireballs. Who the hell am I to damage the Naga Fireballs, Doctor? You see? It works! Ouch! What's the matter? Did something just cut me? Oh, yes. You're bleeding. Look. The cloth is all torn. What did you do? You made many. You go that way. That gets into his eyes. THE END OF BUDDHIST LENT FESTIVAL Don't die. Venerable Father! -Venerable Father! -Venerable Father! -Where are you, Venerable Father? -Where are you? Venerable Father, where are you? -Where are you? -Venerable Father! I'm ready. We'll go and set those fireballs tonight. It shouldn't really matter if the fireballs come a little late this year. Don't burn them. We're going diving. I'm not going back... Khan. Venerable Father said that all of this should end according to Karma. Sacred Naga, I have missed you so very much. THE END OF THE BUDDHIST LENT DAY I can't wait to die, knowing that I'll get to meet you. Everyone would want to come and meet you, don't they? In merely ten years, the Naga Fireballs have grown from a miracle of nature on the banks of the Mekhong River to become a great festival. It is now an event that all Thais and even foreigners must come to see with their own eyes at least once in their lifetime. NAGA FIREBALLS FESTIVAL 2002 I don't think I have to explain what is about to happen next. Your greatness must have the special cognizance to know that everything has ended peacefully in its own way. Hey, that's enough. -Move back. -Hey, go up. Okay. There were over 100 fireballs last year. There are 300 this year right in front of the Thai Temple. I'm betting it all this year. Dear Great Naga, if you do exist, please don't release any fireballs this year to prove your sacred power. You shithead! If you're praying like this, the villagers won't get to see anything. -Hey, if there're... -The bus fare is expensive. -Listen, asshole. -If he does exist, then accept it. I shouldn't have invited your ass here. Why? -You asshole. -Hey. -Why did you invite me here? -You. Say that again. Hello, ma'am. It's so unfortunate that it's raining. Will you be earning less? It's fine. They said it'll rain more. -Okay. -It'll rain harder this evening. There'll be more Naga Fireballs -than this, dear. -Okay. Hey, what did the foreigner say? Did you understand? If you're going to do, you do. I do. We do. LUANG TEMPLE NAGA FIREBALLS PHENOMENON I guess I can only carry out my duty for you up to this year. Thank you for donating this fair amount of time full of happiness to all of us. Although I'm not able to offer you a great Buddha image, build a road, or a cathedral in your name, I'm sure that making these Naga Fireballs is a good merit. Why do you have to hurry back tonight? There's so much traffic, Khan. I think you better leave tomorrow. You'll be back for the fireballs next year, right? Venerable Father has passed away. Or you won't come back here again? If you do come back, come stay over. I'll keep a room for you. Alice. About the test, I have an answer for you. I choose to leave before I fail. Hey, Khan. Take a look at this. Quick. This belongs to Venerable Father. This is what he ordered me to do during that time. But we have all been so busy that we didn't get it done. Now, Venerable Father has passed away, I think this has to be yours, Khan. "For the champion of the Mekhong, be careful. The clay from a raw fireball shouldn't be put in water." What does that mean? MEKHONG RIVER CHAMPION Just hang on a bit, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this year's fireballs have come later than previous years. It might be due to the amount of water this year. Don't let it slip out of your sight. You have been warned! I think the guy who claims to have driven a boat and saw the fireball factory on the other side may be telling the truth. Hey, why aren't there fireballs yet? The Minister is getting upset. Governor, the monk who made this has passed away yesterday. So, I think... There will be no fireballs? We're screwed. Yes, Governor. We are screwed. Look! The fireballs in Venerable Father's bag... They are all gone, Doctor. Lastly, may you, the Great Sacred Naga, join in giving blessings to every single one of my team members, especially Khan. If you, Great Naga, have further intentions, please make them apparent to him. Amen. At least, I agree with you that we must take care of our environment if they still want to see the fireballs. Whether we believe or not, this is the life of the people who live on both sides of the Mekhong. It has been like this for hundreds of years. We don't know if we'll get to see something like this again. You have to admit that the beauty of the Naga Fireballs which we have anxiously waited for since dusk is beautiful and impressive. Truly, they are well worth the wait. This has created a wonderful atmosphere at the end of Buddhist Lent this year. It is an event that we humans must record in our minds, no matter what the true cause of this phenomenon is. Lastly, For the old Monks and Khan, who are reading my letter right now. May the radiant light of the Naga Fireballs that shoots up into the sky teach us to realize that when we're born into this lifetime, if we can make any good deeds, we should do it fast before the fireballs in our life are extinguished. BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU DO, DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. THANKS TO MR. MANAS KANOKSIL, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF NONG KHAI HOSPITAL AND ASSOCIATE PROF. MONTREE BOONSANER, OF KHON KEN UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU, AUDIENCE, FOR NOT DISCLOSING THE ENDING. Subtitle translation by Todd Lavelle
