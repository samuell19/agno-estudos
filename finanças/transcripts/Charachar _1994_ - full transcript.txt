Then must have fly away. l don't believe this same reason everyday. How does it possible? l've locked the cage. l've counted yesterday before l sleep. Even our trained birds are also missing? l asked several times to find some way out. Who cares of my word, your birds, your investment and nothing to me. l'll go wherever l wish to. Remember, we have not stock of food. The same bird, l can notice her well, ... this is third time she trapped. How nice... so cool...as nothing has happened. She doesn't even know that l can sale her to Master. Do you need some more Laka da? l have extra bread sweets. No...give it to your father. Lakha da, lt seems you'ld feel better if you get the birds free from cage. You are so compassionate of birds, is't it? Birds inside the cage, does it looks good? You are not doing it correct. you have already freed four birds. lf you're trying to make me fool, do it, but do you ever think of your family? You've already taken advance from Sansmal Babu. How do you repay the amount until you offer birds. l don't like this bird dealings any more. lt's your family business, once you give up how will you survive? l wedged and sold many birds only to survive. and peoples of the city kills and gobble half of them. lt hurts me deeply when l realize. Only due to us these birds depart their life. l don't have the same opinion, it's one kind of job doing by us, otherwise how do we survive lf we don't do this? Okay, l do agree... but sometimes this kind of job feels me terrible, as l feel that, birds are asking there are different kind of job to do, then why do we grab them? and confine them into cage? and if so, why sale us to someone? Do you remember Netai... my three years son, yes ...a little bit, lt's quite a long ago. ...l guess more than 7 years, l never reveal you a fact, Bhushan uncle. when Netai passes away, just few days before the incident l've seen a bird was died inside the cage, lt's so natural occurrence ... But the event hurts my son deeply, he was going somewhere carrying the dead bird, l saw, he was digging a hole and implanting that bird. l asked him the reason behind it, He answered implanting a tree of birds. Now a days l recall his words frequently. lt's child state of mind, Not exactly, uncle. He appears in my dream during the day of selling these birds. l can see he is quite upset. When he was alive l used to entrap many birds everyday ... But he gets upset when l go for deals with birds. Already passes many days... Wife is now out of any affliction of my son. She is trying to think for new reason to live. l too have the same eagerness... ...like those birds. Now l've no grievance for Netai. l can't see his face appropriately in my dream. But the fellow has taught me to feel affection for birds. Now l feel, l've got more affection of those birds than Netai. Lakha, don't speak like idiot. get involve into your family. Bird is our life to survive, dealing in birds brings us food, otherwise we'll die. Try to make her understand, ask her to take care of you. l've so many things to discuss. What are you doing Netai? l'm implanting a bird, a tree of birds will grow up. Netai ... Sari ... Sari.. Yes ...what happened? Look there... That bird of Netai ... What odd are you doing at this midnight? Lie down ... get sleep now. You become so changed, Sari. Yes ... Do you still love me? Do you ? l've no one other than you. Why? ...your birds! Why are you asking at this midnight? Get sleep. Lakha,.. why didn't you come to office with your birds? Because birds were not caged, so. Okay, l agree, but what about the stocks already with you? Won't you deliver those? this time we have huge orders from city. and you know very well that Sansmal babu depends only on you, even he has already given you a large amount as an advance. You must come tomorrow with your stock of birds. Make him happy by supplying a large amount of birds. Let's see, l'll be there very soon. But few birds has come into lake this season, How can other people does? No one will believe this excuse. Have you seen? Yes ... l was planning to ask you something since few days. Now tell me... Do you know that ... when you get busy in your job, roaming around lake and behind birds... then that bustard use to come to your wife. How do you get this information, since you spend all along the day with me. may be l roam here and there due to my job... but what about other villagers? Can't they see or understand anything? People can say anything, don't rely on them. What a wise decision, you'll stay in village and asking to stay away from villagers. l'm cautioning you repeatedly, be careful of your family. Lakha, ... don't do it. You are just impossible Lakha, what kind of man are you? you are still freeing birds, how long will you continue this? Lots of bird...where they come from? Endless birds, despite caging all, There are lots and lots of birds in this universe? certainly there are lots of birds, otherwise how they appear. no one knows ... Sometimes it feels like they are not belongs to this universe. Otherwise it never ends, continuously appears appears. meaningless ... just imagine ... my father and grand father has done, .. their four father were in the same profession, they have done... you people are same, All they are passes away long ago, But this birds are still exist. One day you see all human being will disappear for their endless sin. only these birds will survive in this universe, ... you see that. You have to go to market today, then l'll go along with you to Sansmal Babu's office. let's deliver the birds, last few days we have gathered enough birds. Bhusan uncle ... Our village stream assembles with river ... ...and this river gets assembles with ocean, ... yes...what odd in it? Have you ever seen ocean? ...No.. Once l've seen someone who has seen ocean, a strange sound of roaring comes out of it, .. and thousands of birds flies over it. That's quite difficult to catch them, but it brings huge money once you grab. sometimes, l can hear that strange sounds of roaring, and at the same time sounds of big wings ... Can you explain, why does this happen? Don't know, all bogus... Come on Lakha, ... our boat has come, let's go. Where is your destination? these all are your birds? l'm also a dealer of birds... Are you going to deliver birds at Nabin Sansmal's storehouse? Yes sir! l'm from Calcutta, l'm also going there. Have l ever seen you there? You may have seen ...many peoples comes over there. you're correct...but l visit very rare, my staff use to come frequently. You people climbed at Nittanandapur wharf, these all birds caged from there? Yes. How much you get from Nabin Sansmal against each bird? That is not fixed...sometimes Re 1 /- and sometimes according to bird we get 3 to 5/- l purchase birds from Sansmal... my stores is in Calcutta... at Hatibagan. What will you do after purchase? whom do you offer these birds? l sale them. You sale them to Sansmal and l sale them at Calcutta after purchasing from Sansmal. People purchase all these birds? There are thousands of people to purchase. people purchase for pet purpose, or for circus, zoo etc. they can sale it outstation, Delhi, Bombay and even export to foreign country also. This has no end...there are many people like me who deals in birds. Have you ever been at Calcutta, ... Hatibagan? We went there once or twice, We don't have any spare time to visit Calcutta, l've something to discuss with you, you do one thing... after you finish your job with Sansmal, wait for me at market, l'll discuss over there. only these few birds? ... Natabar, what's happening? Why they are supplying small number of birds? Don't you ask them regularly to supply? l use to ask them every day, what else can l do, if they don't deliver. Prahallad, your two birds are almost dead, you could have bring complete dead. they doesn't want to catch birds... sit down ... ldrish.. come over here. His four birds are short. Okay ... You've given four pair of Moina, three pieces parrot, two pair of kingfisher and five pigeon, all together twenty five, take it. Lakaha, you've stop visiting here until you're informed by someone. you didn't come last five days ... did you ever count how much have you taken as an advance? yes l remember... that should be more than 1 00/- bucks. Come here with your cage. Only thirty birds... what shall l do with these? lt took many days only to catch these little number of birds. But l need more birds, Lakha. lf you people don't supply, how do l arrange? are you asking me to roam around lake? Everyday peoples from Calcutta comes and places their order. all birds of winter season. this gentleman ... has come from hotel at Calcutta. places order for Teal... l'am ready and lie in ambush, What can l do if they don't come.. only few birds has come this season, l guess specially in our area. Why? How these people gets? just few days back they've supplied. even today they have come to deliver, and it's only you who doesn't get. your wife has said to Natabar that You don't like to enclose birds at all. l'm just coming ... Yes...you take a break. l've taken advances from many peoples, shall they keep quite if they don't get birds. they won't ready to listen anything, only bird.. birds may not be available here, why don't you go some other place? birds must be available, where can they vanish. Nature is becoming polluted due to gas and smoke of factory... birds will gradually stop coming. not only smoke of factory... this universe is almost finished due to war and huge bomb blasting. let me ask my requirement ... l need some money right now, then give us birds ... Master ...again he needs money, This is your bad habit Lakha ... give him 1 0 yes...carry on. This is address of my store, A big city like Calcutta, can we able to find out your address? yes you can, l said Hatibagan, just show this paper and ask anybody, you'll reach. after reaching Hatibagan ask for bird store of Kalicharan take this as an advance ... fare to reach Calcutta is also included in it, next, you'll get money according to your supply of birds, payment daily basis. try to convince some other people who can supply me birds, you'll get your commission, you can earn extra money. and remember don't reveal our meeting to anyone, specially to Nabin Sansmal. lf he comes to know, it's your risk, nothing to me. You didn't do it correct, We didn't do anything wrong, he has invited us. lt's not that we won't sale birds to Sansmal Babu birds will be distributed partly to Calcutta and partly to Sansmal. otherwise he may doubt us, ... you've made a nice plan. Just imagine, how we are being cheated by Sansmal Babu. He gets 1 5/- to 20/- bucks against sale of each birds after purchasing in cheap rate from us. does he ever think of our existence. We hunt birds and Sansmal Babu hunts us. as sometimes birds escaped from us, we're also escaping from Sansmal Babu. he is teaching us to cheat. you always speaks rubbish. lf you earn some extra money, that will ultimately solve your family scarcity. Gouri is enough matured and ideal to tie her knot.. l've to settle down her future. There must be some personal needs of your companion. if you provide her sufficient food and some ornaments, she'll be with you for rest of your life. what you're saying is correct. ultimately l have to continue this trade any way. otherwise who is standing beside you to help? sometimes l get scared ... scared of what? l guess ... you won't stay with me any more. whom did you listen all these? My feelings ... Each and everyone of Sansmal Babu's store office knows ... your extra marital affair with Natabar, l would request you not to tear down our bindings, do you really believe in our bindings? have you ever notice the condition of our house? Do you listen any of my words, quite difficult to arrange sufficient food everyday. do you notice my apron by any chance? and you are asking for our relationship. only when you want me to quench you physical needs. but you never get tired of playing with birds any time. still if you could grab some little more. at least l get some money, otherwise ... l would have die by starvation. Who gives you money? Why do you need to know? first you earn some money then show your male domination. Now l will... l'll earn a lot ... l'll move to Calcutta ... l'll cage many birds... and sale out there, At least if Netai was alive... you would have settle your mind. that is my ill fate ... l forget that pain any way... lt's already passes many years, still l couldn't fill up my lap further. you have birds with you, l have nothing ... nothing ... l don't like this bindings any more, Netai .... what are you doing this? How lucky the bird is, fly away before she locked up. fly away or you get her free. you can trust me, l won't free birds any more. l'll take all birds to Calcutta and sale out there l've to look after my family Let's try once more. Only one problem, sometime l get crazy. l feel like freeing all birds. lt's more than enough that you're realizing the fact. just have a look at sky ... rain looks nice when it falls over the forest .. l'm just coming from forest, l haven't love trees many days. will you join me to wet in rain? l'm still in normal sense, you go, now you get Natabar and strike him thrice. He is trying to exploit Sari. He must taught a good lesson. The actual reality is, if a women contemplates to do any awful, who'll stop? who knows the fault could have done by her, we have to make out a plan for Calcutta, we have to carry all birds collected within next two days. but there is a bit trouble, what trouble? How do we carry these huge birds? if we caught by police? moreover if we are seen by workers of Sansmal? that l have already decided, we'll walk down two miles to reach rail station and by train to Calcutta. if they charge for birds? bull shit... you come tomorrow morning to discuss in this issue. l also wish to fly like this. l feel like observing all of you from sky by flying, you... Sari ... Sansmal Babu, ...Natabar look, how dreamy the life of birds, No need to earn, no family bindings, only flying ... See you then... okay. l feel scary to come this place alone, quite lonely, l'm in hurry to return home, No ... don't remove shirt l said l've to return home, This is for you, l went to Calcutta to deal of birds. l feel to bring something for you. so l purchased it. keep this money... Keep it ... l don't like this everyday. l understand ... you think ... l pay for touching you, but that is not true, if you leave him to stay with me for ever ... you'll get respect as my wife, sometimes l feel ... he'll get mad due to bird, he caged birds ... and set them free. he use to speak with birds ... dreaming of birds ... l'am no one in his world. but sometimes it seems he is different kind ... as he needs me too. l don't get it clear. l'll move now, l've to return home before he reach. okay ... what has happened to you? since evening you attitude looks different, nothing has happened, l'll leave tomorrow for Calcutta, where will you go? Calcutta ... but l don't know this. How will you go? Did you ever go Calcutta? Bhushan uncle will join me, l won't sale birds to Sansmal any more. a trader of Calcutta visited here, he invited us to sale, and offered better price, and l don't know anything about this? didn't l say that day? henceforth l'll sale huge birds, for selling purpose l'll go. you're accustomed of escaping caged birds. lt's quite difficult to give-up this habit. lt's better to escape me like caged birds. that won't be painful for you. and you'll forget soon if really you feel like. lf l gets you free you'll go into some other cage. instead of that why don't you give me a chance? and if l can will you forget Natabar? Bhushan uncle...are you still sleeping? he's gone to river, will back soon, you seat. have this tea. and see don't set these birds free. as it's your normal nature. No ... l won't do that any more. l love to see the moment, when you releases birds from the cage. lt doesn't suits anything else to you. your face becomes pleasant at that time. when l come to know you'll Join my father to sale birds at Calcutta l couldn't believe it partly, which Lakha da do l know? l was under impression that ultimately you won't come, l'm sure that my father must have done all these. still l expected ... lf Sari would have your nature, l'm passing through a deep trouble Sari and birds, both are matchless, l've to sacrifice any one. Nice to see you, ... come, ... sit down ... have you seen bird market here? lt's good ... l know many Sansmal as you people are coming from, they use to supply me birds my monthly sale as much as l can cover the sky with birds, how many cages they have delivered? eight cages ...
