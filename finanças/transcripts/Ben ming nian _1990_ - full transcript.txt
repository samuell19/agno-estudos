Quanzi? Yes, it's me. - Auntie Lou, it's me. - You scared me. I thought you wouldn't be back till after Spring Festival. I got out sooner than expected. The Government has been easy on you. That's the way things go. No one's lived here for over a year. Tidy it up, would you? I've already had breakfast, thanks. Light the stove. Come and take some coal if you need it. Thanks, I'll come and see you soon. Number 30... Who is number 30? Number 30? - How much? - 1,000 yuan. - What's your name? - Li Huiquan. Oh, no. Wu Guizhi. That's my mother's name. Hey, where's Bai Liben? Bai Liben? Which one...? The one who does the buying. Oh, you mean "Skinny"? He died in a motorcycle accident. - When? - A year ago. Stolen bike, too. Our factory has been closed for eight months. The authorities said it went bankrupt. Everyone gets 40% of their salary. That's barely enough for breakfast. This isn't a good time for you to have come back. Your mother was an honest person, one in a million. Then, suddenly... gone. Your mother worked here most of her life. You taking over when she retired wasn't an easy thing. Aunt Fang, I'm Quanzi! - Quanzi? - I'm out. I came to see you. I was wondering who you were. Xiao Wu, we have a visitor. - Sit down. - OK. Aunt, these are for you. How's Uncle? What can I do for you? Me? Oh, nothing. I mean, now I don't have a job. Since I have lots of time, if you have any work, just call me. It's good that you're out, but you should look after yourself first. We don't need any outsider's help. Chazi was sentenced to life. He still has brothers here at home. We don't consider him as family any more. Just forget about him and get on with your own life. Do you have any of his letter? I'd like... his address. - I'll get it for you. - No! Well, I'll be off then. - There's no hurry. - No, it's OK. Take your gifts with you. Quan! Quan! My dad said you're out of work. Keep them. Fuck off! Here's my brother's address. - What class are you in? - Year 10. - Do you miss your brother? - Not really. He broke the law. What he did was terrible. Piss off. Hey, Quan! What's up? My brother's calling you. Quanzi, hurry up! See that girl? She's cheating on me. - I want to teach her a lesson. - OK, let's do it. My hair's natural. A girl should be naturally beautiful. And your eyebrows? They're just like that naturally. - You like them? - Of course. What do you want? Chazi, let go of me! You bastard. - What are you doing? - Let go of me. We broke up ages ago. Why are you still chasing after me? Let me go! No, no... Bastard! Hurry up! Zhuzhu! Bastard! Murder, help! I thought you'd got asphyxiated from the fumes. - What's up? Drink too much? - No, I didn't. No? So what's with all the broken dishes? You've been reported. Why did you drink so much? Showing off? Pay up! Pay for it like a man. - How much? - If you had a job, I'd ask for 200 yuan. Aunt Luo put in a good word for you. Three dishes and two cups. 7.60 yuan in total. Smarten up. Just out of jail and you're already in trouble. - Your change. 2.40 yuan. - Forget it. Just give it to them. Nonsense, I've already paid it for you. Here's a receipt. 28 fen. I still owe you 12 fen. Keep it. Here, take half a pack of cigarettes. All settled. - Join me. - What were you inside for? - Fighting. - Fighting? Let me give you a light. Still want to fight? Just come and fight me whenever you want. Think you can take me on? What's there to laugh about? Be on your best behaviour. From now on, report to the police station every month. OK? You always say "yeah", then forget it. Remember to report. I'm going. - Stay and have some tea. - No, I'm busy. Don't drink too much. If you feel bored, just buy a book to read. Come to the office tomorrow. That's your trader's licence. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Try your best. These are hard to come by. The Year of the Dragon is here. Dragon years are full of change. - What are you thinking? - What does fate hold for this year? - Mum. - Yes, I'm coming. - Mum, come out, hurry! - Coming. Mum, here he is. - I hear you've got a PhD. - I haven't finished it yet. We're going to see the ice lanterns in Harbin. Come in and sit down. - Quanzi's back. - A couple of weeks now. Let's go and see him. - You go in first. - Let's go inside. Quanzi! - He was just here. - Where has he gone? Maybe he's gone out. Mum, is Quanzi all right? He was well behaved inside. Mum, his parents are pressuring us into getting married. Then why don't you? I'd like to wait until he finishes his studies. Why? You're 24. This is your zodiac year, the Year of the Dragon. It's a lucky time for you to get married. - Hey, Quanzi! - What is it, Xiaofen? - Look, I'm wearing a red belt. - What's that for? My mum said it would bring good luck. - That's just superstitious - My mum said it's my zodiac year. - Red will ward off this year's bad luck. - Is that true? Aren't you 12 years old? It's your year too. You should wear a red one too. Go and ask your mum. Really? The Year of the Dragon is here! Chazi, Happy New Year... I'm a free man. Are you OK? You must be working pretty hard. Beijing is not too cold. It must be freezing in Qinghai. Skinny killed himself on a motorbike. For three years I've been thinking that girl wasn't worth it. Your parents are fine. I've found a job. I start in the New Year. No one looking over your shoulder. I like it that way. You should work hard, think less, speak less and make more friends. People like us have nothing to fear if we have friends. Goodbye, write to me. I'm going to bed. You're new here. Hey, do you want a cigarette? Don't have a stall yet? That sucks. Give me one. - Kind of late, isn't it? - The late film hasn't finished yet. 30 fen. Just starting, aren't you? Trendy clothes are the way to go. General goods don't make money. They're no good for business. Trainers! Trainers! Nike trainers! - How much? - Very cheap. Been fishing again? Come here and have some fish. He's back. Quanzi, there's a letter for you. Thank you, Auntie. - I want to speak to you for a moment. - What is it? Tell me know. Hey, just tell him, why don't you? Officer Zhao has found a girl for you. - I asked him to. - I don't need a girlfriend. You have to go and meet her this time. Maybe some other time. There's no need to be shy. You're already 24. Think about it. With your mother gone, I'm responsible for these things. OK, maybe later. Give me a photo. I'll make sure she gets it. Quanzi, I got your letter. It really gave me a scare. I thought my parents had died. You're right. Friends are the most important thing. I haven't received any letter since I've been here, not even from my family. I've read your letter 20 times. Each time I cried. I'm proud to have a friend like you. The weather if fine here and work is not too hard. There are so few people from Beijing here. When I fight for food with southerners, I always lose. You're out now. Take care of yourself. I'm trying to get my sentence reduced. Oh, yeah. Are you going to get married soon? Chazi. Hey, have a look at these. The red one is cool. It's a bit big and the lace is too fancy. I don't like it. Let's go. Hi, how much are these shoes? You've got eyes. Have a look yourself. What did you say? Do you always talk to customers like that? I have my own eyes, but it seems you left your mouth in someone's bed last night. - Fuck off. - Is that a challenge? Listen to me. Ask anyone in this district... I tell you. Li Huiquan, don't you recognise me? Hey, it's impossible! That year in the park, you nearly killed me with a stick. Then I took you for hotpot. - Don't you remember? - Oh, you're Ma.... Shuazi. Ma Dawang. - You still talk too much. - That's just my nature, man. - What are you doing now? - I work for a joint venture. American boss but speaks British English. You must have just got out. I hear it's very tough inside. Here, take them. You're kidding. I'll go and get some cash. - Give it a break. - I shouldn't. - How much for this one? - 50. Nice sweater. Would look great on my girlfriend. Take it with you. Now you're really embarrassing me. OK, then. Let's meet for a drink tonight. My treat. I'll bring my girlfriend. You can give me some advice. I told you everything is wrong Such a love should never have been I told you I've never been in love So I'm leaving quietly... Tell me, I'm a man How can I take this? Hey, Bro'! What are you doing here all by yourself? If you give us some tickets, we'll find you a pretty one. Come in, please. Brother. He's here. Take a seat here. Wine! This is my girlfriend, Sile. Li Huiquan. He's like a brother to me. How do you do? Did I tell you before? He left me with seven bumps on my head. I still have them. Feel my head if you don't believe me. What a shame! She[s wearing the sweater you gave her. Looks really cool. Stop being a jerk. You see. OK, I'll stop. What kind of world are we living in? Nowadays, women are like mares. They'll kick you in the heart whenever they feel like it. Where's the justice for a man? Idiot. Brother, excuse me. Sile! Sile! Hey, friend. Are you Li Huiquan? - Yes, do I know you? - Cui Yongli. I worked at the machinery factory. I've heard a lot about you. Just scandal. Not worth mentioning. Have a drink. Tonight, we're honoured to have with us the winner of the Cultural Palace Pop Song Competition, Miss Zaho Yaqiu Let's welcome her so she'll give us a song. I'm not a famous singer. I only came fourth in the competition. Now, let me sing you a song called "Expectation". I was expecting a woman, not a young girl. Boring. Slowly, you come to me Softly, you ask why I'm sad I don't know how to answer So you hold your gaze on my face Sing us a happier one! Come on! There are lots of girls like her on the streets. I prefer older ones. What about you? Excuse me a minute. Slowly, you make me feel flustered My tears flow, without me knowing What I've been longing for has today come true I've decided to follow you wherever you go Where's the manager? Someone's been following me. Those punks. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Will you escort Miss Zhao home? - I have another engagement. - To do what? Huiquan. Will you take her home? You can depend on him. He's strong enough to defeat an army. Yes, that is true. - OK, let's go. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - That's OK. - Huiquan, don't forget to visit me! - OK. Hey, beautiful, sing us a love song. Just one glance, and I'll miss you a lifetime! Sing us another song. Don't make trouble here, got it? You really scared those guys. They were speechless! - What's your name? - Li Huiquan. - Where do you work? - I sell clothes at a market. My home is just up the stairs. Thank you. Bye. Hey, did you like my singing? Yes, I did. I'll be there again on Saturday. See you then! Hey, be smart! Hey, you made it, Brother. Wait inside. I won't be a minute. What about the next? ...rules and punishment on illegal pricing activities. They were directed against negligence. In supervising, inspecting and punishing unlawful price practices, the main principle is to punish these violators economically. Ordinary violators will be fined up to 2,000 yuan... You two, get two bags of clothes ready. - What about my receipt? - You'll get it. Just get out of here. Can't I even ask? It's really tiring, dealing with them. - Is he your friend? - Shit! Who has friends in these times? They'll stab you with a knife for just a little cash. They'll sell their parents wholesale if the price is right. Have a smoke. Huiquan, I want you to make yourself at home here. I rent this house from a farmer. Come anytime. This is the wedding house prepared for his 15 year old son. - I'm not as clever as you. - What do you mean? - Nothing. - You're a smart guy! It's easy for me to hire a bodyguard. I just want to make friends with you. Brother, don't misunderstand me. Here they are. Three bags altogether. - See for yourself. - That's OK. Don't worry. I'll never cheat you. - Quanzi! - Auntie. - Your uncle asked me to tell you off. - What have I done? Why didn't you come to Xiaofen's wedding? Why did you buy that expensive carpet? It must have cost you a fortune. That wasn't a carpet. It was a tapestry. Anyway, he wants me to scold you. I can see you're not happy. Is it about that girl? No. She just sells tickets at the public baths. She is not up to our standards, not the other way round. - Aunt, don't worry about me. - Who will care about you if I don't? With your mother gone, I'm your mother now. OK, see you. - How much? - Hey, let me through! - That one is 2 yuan. - Excuse me, excuse me! - How much is this? - Excuse me, excuse me! - Can I return this underwear? - No, you can't. - It's too small. - You've already worn them. - Can you show me that one please? - The one with the stripes? Please give me a refund. - Sorry to trouble you again. - It's nothing. I don't feel at ease, singing there. How much do you get paid a night? 4 yuan. Screw them, bunch of cheats. - I don't mind. - A cup of coffee costs 5. I need more performing experience. I don't have a job. Without this experience, I'll never have a chance. My father arranged for me to have photos taken for my album. - Here, take one. What do you think? - You keep it. Hey, who's going to produce an album for me? It's just a silly dream. - Thank you. - Thanks. - I have to hold on to you. - OK. - Be careful. - Don't worry. I hear you have a reputation round here. Is that true? They told me that you're a tough guy. - Why haven't I noticed? - Ah... Are they trying to put me off? No, I'm not a good man. I got into a fight and nearly killed someone. I was sent to jail for three years. It's true, I'm not lying. Really? I don't believe it. Go home, your father's probably waiting for you. Bye, then. Are they fooling me or are you fooling me? I'm screwed. Everything's ready. But she said without a tape recorder we can't get married. I don't have a penny now. How much do you need? Anything would be a help. It's up to you. You're a life saver. Here. Put it in your pocket. Marry her. If I don't return it to you, I'm a real son of a bitch. Sir, when will Zaho sing again? I heard she's gone to a performance festival. I don't know when she'll be back. - Huiquan. - I didn't recognise you. Made some money out of those clothes? Where did you get those rags? Biting the hand that feeds you now. - What do you think of my car? - A car and a pretty girl. Don't worry, I won't report you. You've convinced me. Don't get your knickers in a twist. Do you know who organises the performance festival? - Performance festival? What? - Nothing. I don't know. Forget it. Just get going. Mr. Liu. Wait a minute. Stand over there. No, you can't make a move like that. No jumping. There's a call. Come here. Nothing serious. Take it easy. I heard you've been behaving yourself recently. But be careful who you make friends with. Stay clear of people like Cui Yongli. Have a cigarette. Do you play chess? A little. Take a look. Is he going to checkmate me? What about this move? Move this guy over there. You won't be beaten now. That's right. OK then. Get lost. See you later. Aunt Luo said you're a bit down. What's up? No luck with the ladies? - No. - Don't be put off. After this one you can go after another. I was rejected once. I caught a lot more crooks than usual after that. Well, come to see me anytime. That's very kind of you. We can't meet everyday But you're there all the time Although we are far apart You always remain in my heart We can't meet everyday But you're there all the time Although we are far apart You always remain in my heart Remember the day we parted? You urged me again and again Even if our paths seldom cross Our love will never change There are too many words in the world There are too many stars in the sky Life is forever changing Our laughter is as sweet.... ...as our childhood Thank you. Would you be free to do a recording sometime? Sorry, I have to go. Here's my card, Miss Zhao. Thank you. - Hello! - Hello! Li Huiquan, how are you? This is a friend who I met at the performance festival. I won't trouble you to take me home. - Bye! - Bye! Quanzi. Policeman Xiao Liu is looking for you. He's over there. Be quick. Can you watch my stand for me? Mr Liu, buying your girlfriend some clothes? I'll buy your head. Chazi escaped from the labour camp. - Really? - About ten days ago. You wrote to him, didn't you? Go and get the letter, We're going to the station. Why do you always do such foolish things? Go on, get going. Have they caught him? None of your business! Brother. It's me. My mother sent me here. What's the matter? She said that if my brother visits you, ask him to give himself up and not to come home. Get lost. My father says my brother will either be shot or he'll get a death sentence. Just ask him not to get us into trouble. Go back and tell your parents. Your brother's a son of a bitch. He should never have been born. Fuck off. For fuck's sake. - Tickets. - How much? - 1.80 yuan. - It's expensive, 1.80 yuan. American movie, want a ticket? Want a ticket? American striptease movie. Do you want a ticket, sister? Give me the tickets and come with me. I wouldn't do this if I had a choice. I have lots of debts. She won't marry me without a VCR. Didn't she ask you to buy here a plane? Hey, living is boring. To work is boring, to be free at home is boring too. Having a girlfriend is boring. Not having a girlfriend is boring too. Why is everything so fucking boring? Nonsense. What have you done with my money? Having money is boring. Having no money is boring too. Would you be excited if I beat the shit out of you? You beating me is boring. If you don't that's also boring. Then just let me beat you. Brother, don't hit me. - If I tell you everything... - Tell me! My girlfriend broke up with me three months ago. I lost all your money gambling. I trusted you. Don't hit me in the face. I have to work tomorrow. You hit me! Li Huiquan, you're a goddamn fool. Your little singer ran off with Cui to Guangzhou. You're totally in the dark. Who's paying for this? Your shadow in my memory Your smiles in my sadness Your steps are my road home I'm still waiting, but you've forgotten Already forgotten The signs of you won't return You don't return, but I'll open myself to you The sight of you won't return You don't return, but I'll open myself to you The sight of you won't return - Who is it? - It's me. Oh, it's you. You scared me. - You don't come here much any more. - Not much. Are you tired of my songs? No, it's my business that's keeping me busy. Earning money is tiring. I'm tired too. Now I earn 5 yuan more than before. Really? The dress you were wearing wasn't good on you. Was it too revealing? No. You're still too young for that sort of thing. You can wear it when you're older. You should be aware of cheats. Work hard and you'll succeed. You sound like my father! Your words are even practically the same as his. Thank you. Miss Zhao, how beautifully you sang. Can I have your autograph? Thank you. What are you grabbing me for? - Why are you grabbing me? - What are you doing here? Nothing. Just having a look. I'll leave when the lights go out. - Does she know you? - No. She's from my school. Two years above me. I don't know her, honestly. I don't even know what I'm doing. Idiot. Girls, lock the gate. Let's have some of this. So, have you thought about what I said? What did you say? One should do whatever one likes. I know you're generous. But you're a bit too hard on yourself. What's the fun in denying yourself all the time, right? Are you laughing at me? A bit. Oh, oh! A couple of years ago, I would have kicked your ass. Yes, I believe it. Let me show you something. Therea re 100 tapes here altogether. 20 originals and 80 copies. They'll be worth ten times more up north. People who live in the cold love this. I call it irrigating the north with water from the south. "Blue" water. What do you think? Do you want to join me? No, find somebody else. I would if I trusted anyone else. The police are watching me. Because of Chazi? If he's heading for your place, isn't it wise to come with me? You're crazy if you still can't see what I'm driving at. Were you actually reformed in prison? I'm nearly 40. I'm much older than you. I lost my virginity at 16. I know what I'm talking about. It's all the same. Just a bunch of animals fucking. That black woman is pretty good. - Are you taking her with you? - You're well informed. I want to take a break. I'm taking her to Guangzhou. - Has she agreed? - Of course. I've arranged to produce her album. I'll make some money out of it. She's really starting to grow on me. She's so clean and pure. I'm thinking it's about time to make my move. Who knows? Maybe she's just dying for it. Don't touch her. I see. You've already... Just don't touch her. OK, I won't touch her. But what if she touches me? Watch it yourself. I'm tired of this. Here. Brother. Brother. Tell Cui to forget about these fucking games. Chazi! Don't worry. No one's there. I climbed from the east wall. Don't worry. I'll go in a minute. You said you'd try to get your sentence reduced. I reduced it myself. My life is over. Death is the worst that can happen. They're searching for me everywhere. Nonsense! You're committing suicide. Don't worry. I'll leave after a couple of hours sleep. I won't get you into trouble. Why didn't you go back home? I don't want to get my mother into trouble. What about me? These last few months were dreadful. I've been living like a dog. Cutting grass in Inner Mongolia. Working in Zhangjiakou. I couldn't stand it any longer. I was scared of everyone, almost shitting myself whenever someone greeted me. Who else could I go to except you? What's your plan? Head south and try to get abroad. Otherwise, I'll kill myself. Got anything to drink? Give yourself up. No, I'd rather die. Then we should find a way out. Whatever you like... Turn off the light. It's freaking me out. Stupid, you shouldn't have escaped. You're dead if they catch you. It's too late. You walked her home three times, that's it? You didn't try anything? You're the only person I've spoken to about her. In prison, I dreamt of my mother. Her hair was white. Good to hear you're still concerned about her. Drop it. You're still a virgin? I called you and you didn't answer, I thought you had a girl with you. Fuck you. Go to sleep. We'll go to the cops tomorrow. You might as well cut off my head and send it to them. - Hi, Aunt Luo. - You're back early. - I've got something to do. - Xiaofen is at home. Li Huiquan, long time no see. Yeah, right. You've been busy too. - How are you? - Getting by. - You've changed a lot. - Is that so? I had a dream one night. We were walking to school. You, me and another classmate. Fang... What was his name? - You mean Fang Guangde? - His nickname is Chazi. You were completely bald. Real idiots. Mum, he's grown up to be a man. - Are you staying healthy? - She's due any day now. Why did you buy so much food? I hate shopping so I'm stocking up. I have some things to do. See you. - Stop by some time. - OK. Have you decided? Yes, I've decided. That's good. Get up and have breakfast. I'll go my own way. - Where? - South. Don't be a fool. Do you want to die? You can't save me. I'm dead, whether I leave or not. Do me a favour. Buy a train ticket for me. Is that her? Quite pretty. You're too old fashioned. I would have slept with her ages ago. All those years inside, nothing but jerking off. I even thought about fucking a donkey. What kind of life is that! What the fuck are you going to do? I need money for a train ticket. Quanzi, Quanzi! Wake up. Quanzi, wake up. Aunt, I'm over here. - But the door isn't locked. - What's wrong? Xiaofen is in labour. We can't find a car. - Don't worry. - Let's go. Quanzi, hurry up! Chazi. Chazi. I waited till evening, but you didn't come back. I know you offered me a way out. I've taken 300 yuan. I'll remember you for the rest of my life. Quanzi, go and see my mother. Don't tell her anything. Sale, everything on sale! CLEARANCE SALE 10,000 and 4,000 yuan. Count it. Stop knocking, I'm coming. - Who are you looking for? - Cui Yongli. He moved out a while ago. I rent it now. - Come back now! - Wait a minute. He doesn't live here any more. - Where can I find him? - Don't know. Maybe the dormitory at the machinery factory. Thank you. - Who are you looking for? - Cui Yongli. A visitor for you. I'm going out for a moment. Let's talk outside. Why are you telling me this? Give me some advice. I always considered you to be pretty level-headed. How could you do something so stupid? Tell me what to do. Be frank. Just pretend you didn't say anything. I'll pretend I haven't heard it. Even is Chazi is caught and his guts are spilled, you just tell the police he stole your money. Brother, I admire you. You're really something. If I tried to live my life the way you do, I'd die from exhaustion. I can't help you with this. These days, we have to protect ourselves. Survival of the fittest. - Let's settle things. - Settle what? Back off, what are you doing? Hey, I didn't touch her. Fuck off. You're back. How's Xiaofen? She'll be out of hospital in a few days. - What about the baby? - It's still in an incubator. It's a chubby baby boy. We should thank Quanzi. Don't talk so loudly. He might be asleep. Pure gold. Raise my exquisite veil and dance, be happy and gay I'm missing you, like a dancing butterfly kissing a rose Oh, lost in the romantic night, full of love My long hair flying in the wind, my veil partly covering my face Oh, can you kiss me and take me in your arms? Oh, can I kiss you under the veil? Oh, can you kiss me and take me in your arms? Oh, can I kiss you under the veil? Oh, kiss me, kiss me, take me in your arms - Can I take your order, sir? - Beer. Could you send the singer over later? Someone over there is looking for you. I don't believe it. How did you find me here? I had nothing to do and was in the neighbourhood. Did you have a good time in Guangzhou? Not bad. Big Cui opened my eyes to a new world. - He already has a wife and child. - I know. Then you shouldn't go running around with him. It's nothing serious. Anything I can do for you? Here's your drink, sir. Thank you. A necklace! It's beautiful. Pure gold. - Is it a gift for me? - Sure. I can't take it. I only accept flowers. Sorry. I'm sorry. If I'd know, I'd have brought you a big bunch of flowers. I'm singing two new songs tomorrow. Will you come? - Of course. - Bye. Where to? Anywhere that's busy. Busy? There's an open concert ahead. I'll leave it to you. Pull over. 25 yuan. That's too much. What's his problem? Let me say something else. Something better. Thank you, friends... ...for coming to see our show. We don't have much to offer you. Let me do the hankie dance for you. Not crazy enough? Let's try some disco. - You drunk, mate? - Lend me some money. He's rich enough. - Get away from me. - Come here. Little bastards. That's a sharp fist you got there. Let's get out of here. Stop right there. Are they fooling me or are you fooling me? - Hey, Quanzi! - What is it, Xiaofen? Look, I'm wearing a red belt. Quanzi, Quanzi! Wake up. Quanzi, wake up. The cops are coming. Go! Chazi! Come here. Hey, get going. We're closed. Who were you yelling at just now? Some guy from the audience. He's gone. Maybe he was a drunk or a lunatic.
