OK, so what is your name? Paul. Paul Curry. OK. Paul. Date of birth? June the 29th, 1950. And marital status? Divorced. OK. Any children? Zoom in, please. - No children, Mr. Curry? - No, children. Yes. Are you in touch with them? Are you in touch with them? Of course I'm in touch with them. - Well, could you stay with them? Mm-mm. - No. OK. Do you want to elaborate on why that is? When was the last time you were in communication? Name? Bikini. - That your first name? It's my only name. It's like Beyonce or Madonna or God. - OK. So your name is Bikini. - No. No. My name is Bikini. That's an interesting name. - Yes, it is. Mm-hmm. - That your real name? - Look, OK. Listen, my mother had a thing for the Bikini Islands. Do you know the Bikini Islands? Isn't that where they tested the atom bomb before Hiroshima? No. No. It was after Hiroshima. And it's 20 bombs. And the Bikinians now want to go home. Do you have a bed? Do you-- listen, do have a bed for me here? - I'm sorry. We don't provide that kind of service. I don't have any beds here. You would have to go to a shelter. I can give you a referral to a women's shelter in the Bronx, but first we have to finish this paperwork. Are you from New York? - No. No I am, Bikinian. Really? - No. Do you know her? Do you know Dorothy? Do you know Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz? Do you know Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz? Do you know her? - I know the Wizard of Oz. Well, Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. I'm sorry. - How did you become homeless? - Iraq. You're a vet? - Yes, I am. We went there to deliver freedom to the poor bastards. I operated a forklift and I did my thing. We were going to rebuild Iraq. I am a carpenter like Jesus with tits. - So how did you become homeless? Iraq. Went there to deliver freedom to the poor bastards. I operated a forklift and I did my thing. We were going to rebuild Iraq. I am a carpenter like Jesus with tits. - Didn't you already say that? - Did I? Look. Look. Here. Here. This is all that I have left. Here, take this. What is this? It's a dragon? - It's a praying mantis. It's the most elegant creature on the face of the planet. Hey, do you want to help me get my daughter back? The authorities took my daughter. They took my daughter away from me. Well, yes or no. - I told you that we don't have beds here. But I can give you a referral to the women's shelter in the Bronx if you would help me complete this form. I need some more information about you. Have you ever been hospitalized? Have you ever been hospitalized? Have you ever seen a psychiatrist? Hey, follow her. Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Jesus, fuck. Man, she's really off the hook right now. Step back. - She can't stay here. It's not allowed. I heard you. No, I'm coming. It's just, it's really hard to leave her now. OK, sorry. I'm sorry, I have to go. - Do you have to go right now? - My mom is waiting for me. Look, I've already stayed half an hour longer than I was supposed to. - It's OK. Go. - This isn't something that a volunteer needs to deal with. - I-- - See you Friday. - I'm sorry. I-- - I hate calling the police. - I don't know, either, but what else is there? - Yeah. - You think I should go in? Excuse me. Huh? - Hi, Miss Bikini? Huh? - Hi, I'm Kate. OK. I'm going to come help you. OK. Boom. Boom. Door. Him. - Zoom in. Zoom in. Zoom in. - We're on a prime. - Well-- all right, whatever. - Mrs. Scarlet. Oh, hi, Mr. Tang. - Good evening. Good evening. - How are you? Hey. - What is this? What are you doing here? - We were here for the round-- - Who are these people? Oh, you remember Trevor, my boyfriend? Trevor's making a documentary film, yeah, about the drop in center. We are ready to rent the room now. This is the woman that I told you about on the phone. This is Miss Bikini. - - Hi. - No, I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking. - No, you just told me. We spoke on the phone half an hour ago. Your basement room to rent. It's taken, Mrs. Scarlett. Look, we'll pay you in advance for a month. And we'll give you a voucher-- We can turn off the cameras, also. I'm sorry, Mrs. Scarlett. Please, just take the money. Come on. - Sorry. - Get to get on a ride and then they don't-- they don't have anything. They don't have anything. Are we there yet? Jeff, you're still there? Everybody's talking. It's just me talking. It's just me. What am I, fucking invisible, huh? Yeah, well. That's what she said. That's what she said. Suck a dick. Take that. This is not a-- fucking Christ. Fucking Christ. Fuck. Fuck. Look, are we going to fucking driving around all fucking night? Fuck. - You should have told me I would be on TV. I would have shaved my legs. Mr. Ilic, this is the woman that I told you about on the phone. I'm Giovan. You can call me Uncle Joe. And you are? - And I am tired. It's lovely, isn't it? All it needs is a woman's touch. - Is there a problem? - Turn off the camera. Is that camera off? Turn off the camera. That's not enough. That's what we agreed on. As rent. But where's the deposit? No, that's not what you said. Look, I'm giving you my own money. You never mentioned a deposit. You can't just do that. - What do you call never mention a-- Come on. Fuck this. - Bikini, what are-- what? Just let her be. Trevor, we need to stop this. Trevor, this is wrong. Hey, come back. - I'm blazing, borderline amazing. Top entertainment, no need for containment. You facing the top notch when you see the basement. I'm in the basement hooking up the traces. The lace with the list audio syntax, sit back. - Krishna. - Hey. - Hello. - How you doing? Hey, everybody. Let's make room for Krishna's boom. - Shut up, Trevor. What's up, buddy? Bikini, how long have you been here, again? - It's two weeks in this room. It's nice. I've got everything I need. So let's go back to where we stopped last time. You were in high school and you wanted to be a carpenter. - I did want to be a carpenter. I was very good at it. I could make anything. My grandmother, at first she couldn't believe it. She thought that the boys at school were helping me to make the stuff. I was actually helping them, though. When I joined the army, I wanted to put this to use. Did you know that you could be sent to Iraq? - I was hoping I'd be sent to Iraq. At the drop in center, you told them that you operated forklifts. - Mm-hmm. - What was your favorite part about that? - The forklift races. You raced forklifts? - I always won. I really kicked their asses. Not like the wussy dykes. Pretend to be tough, fall apart at the sight of a dick. - Did anything go wrong in Iraq? It's Iraq. - Right. - A lot of things went wrong. Right. I guess I meant, you know, did anything go wrong for you? For me? - Yeah. - Oh, for me. Well, I had a nervous breakdown in Iraq. I lost my shit. - I'm sorry. So that happened. - Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. You want to talk about it? - Is that what you want me to do? Only if you want to. - Do you want me to? - Yeah. - What do you think happened? - Cut. Hi, hi. Oh, shit. Sorry. Kate's here. I'm sorry. - I told you to text. I brought you this. - Oh, my goodness. Thank you. Hi, Bikini. - Hi. Hi, Kate. Here. That's for you. - Oh, wow. It's not my birthday. What is-- OK. I am all set for a date now. Do you have anybody in mind? Oh, there's cigarettes. Oh, I picked up your refills. No, I already-- I still have plenty. So it's OK. Are you taking it regularly? - Yes. Every day? Because you need to take them every day, you know. Sorry. Where did you get that? It's an antique. Are things better between you and Trevor right now? - I beg your pardon? Did you two make up? I-- what do you mean? Did he apologize to you? - We're working on it. - Stop. Just stop. Fuck. - I have not seen my daughter in a year. They will not let me see her. And the fucked up thing about it now is that I know where they live. But he won't let me visit her. - Yeah, I want to catch a piece of that. Do you see? So nice and easy. Nice and easy. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. OK. Good. Now rack focus. Rack focus. Yeah, that's good. - Hey, you know why they call Wall Street Wall Street? Because there used to be a wall to protect the Dutch from the English. Here. - No, that's good. - I love the way the light plays on the buildings. Trevor did this gorgeous time lapse photography of light and shadow on Wall Street. - It was before I actually knew what I was doing. - No, your time lapse was beautiful. - Can we go now? - Are you feeling OK? - The medication makes me tired. It wears me out. I could sleep forever. But I can't because I've got all the sand in my bed. Hey, you know, we used to live around here before our landlord raised our rent. This is my favorite neighborhood in New York. You know, we would have been homeless too if we weren't lucky enough to have my parent's place in the suburbs. Yeah, that's not going to last. Rather live in a shelter than the fucking suburbs. Trevor, please. - Ahh. Where are you from, Trevor? Doesn't matter. Yeah, but I want to know. How do you feel about the small town in Nebraska that you came from? - I'm from New York, actually. Well, tell us about mommy-- or daddy. Was daddy rich? - My daddy? Yeah. - He was a dentist. He's a dentist? - Yeah. Did he want you to become a dentist, too? - No, because he died before I was born. Yeah, he overdosed. Trevor, please. Boom, boom, door, in. Zoom in, zoom in. - Mrs. Scarlett. Oh, hi, Mr. Tang. - Good evening. Good evening. What is this? What are you doing here? We're here for the room. Please leave. Who are these people? Well, you remember Trevor, my boyfriend? This is the woman that we told you about. Oh, man. Look at my teeth. They look so good. They weren't always like that, you know. And do not ask me what or who I had to do to get them done because I don't like that story. All right. Worth it, though. Here, please. Just-- So, you like it? It's good, right? - Yeah, I like it. It is good. It's funny. Funny? - Mm-hmm. - You should have told me I would be on TV. I would have shaved my legs. - Mr. Ilic? This is the woman that I told you about on the phone. Oh. Come on. Fuck this. - What? Just let her be. Trevor, we need to stop this. Bikini, you all right? Tastes like asparagus. Like asparagus? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Bikini, let me show you something. You ready? I think you're going to like it. - Is it a diamond necklace? What is it? No, no. It's much better. You ready? Yes. Hold. Wait for it. And here is your daughter. Took us two days to get to them. - Kate told you where? Yeah. Rain the first day ruined the shoot, but it was worth it going back. I mean, it's a great shot. Telephoto lens, it adds this voyeuristic aspect. It puts us in your shoes. This is going to open up the whole film. Different kind of location, an idyllic suburbia. I mean, it's almost surreal in it's fucking vapidity. Simple-minded materialism. The fuck is this bullshit? - And so-- OK, so the two cameras seeing each other, that demystifies the whole filmmaking process. We're all one, the filmmaker, his subject, the viewer. And the mic, I don't mind the mic because, yeah, it destroys the illusion. But it gives you reality. We like the mic. I mean, fuck reality TV. This is reality squared. Can you cue that up again? Let's play it again. It's a lot to process. Hey, go. Go. Turn the radio off. Fuck, Jesus. Krishna! Zoom in. Pan left. Pan left. Step out of the van, please. Step out of the van. Shit. Just keep rolling. Sorry, is there a problem, officer? Just step out of the van. We're just shooting a short film. No, no, no. Everybody out. Please. Let's go. 10-30 in progress. Turn the cameras off please. OK. I want that one off, too. What's going on here? Who are you people? That's her. That's the woman who's been loitering here for months now harassing us. Is this true, miss? Of course it's fucking true. She's been stalking us for months now. She's scaring our little girl. You should arrest her. Find out who she is. I don't know what she wants. She's crazy. - Hey, fuck you. Hey. - Fuck you! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Do you want to get arrested? No. You should arrest her. We've reported her stalking us a dozen times. Good, caught her. Stop stalking us. Who are you? Daddy. Who are you? - No-- You going to be OK, babe? Daddy, she scares me. What do you want? Do you want to sit down? Do you need us to call an ambulance? No, no, no, no. - No! Just give her a second, OK? OK. Call an ambulance. No, no, no. We'll take care of this. Yeah, Krishna was right. That's her. Bikini? Bikini? Hi. Hi. Where have you been? Do you have pants? - Bikini, it's Kate. Look, we've been looking for you for two months. - Let's just call the shelter. - What happened? Look, the Wheatleys, they dropped the charges and the police, they said that it's OK. So you don't have to worry about-- God, she smells. Fuck. No. No. - Come on. Come on. We have to do something. - No. - Look, I don't think she has a place to stay, OK? I think that she's sleeping in the street. - She can find a shelter. She has to put in the effort. - She's in really bad shape and I think we should help. - How? - Just for a week? Just for a week. Please. - Are you crazy? Are you? Because she convinced us that that little girl was her fucking daughter. She was stalking those fucking people. - No, she was confused. - You're confused. She needs help. Professional help. - You can film her all the time. - Can you stop? It's her. Get the door. Pan left. Pan left. OK. Go. But she-- wait. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Get her. Get her. Get her. Cut. Cut. Bikini, you're supposed to come here, not walk away. - Trevor, I don't think she can handle it, man. - She's fine. What are you doing? --the shot. - What are you doing? Oh, God. Hey, guys. Bikini, you want to come in? So this is-- welcome home. We've got three floors, which are yours now. - . - Can you-- do you mind taking your shoes off? - Let me show you where we can put your things, your bags. Are you hungry? You want something to eat? Thirsty? Something to drink? - Water. - OK. - Water? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll get you some water. Room temp, cold? I'll get you a cold one. Shit. - This is my mom's house. I grew up here. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Very nice. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Do you want me to take your coat or-- - No, I will keep my coat. - OK. - Thanks. Thirsty. You can take a shower. Here she is. - But only if you want, of course. So if we just put these things right here-- oh, I wanted to show you something. I have a little surprise for you. She worked on this hard. - Tada. They were my father's. Yeah, he'd collect anything. I mean, any nail or screw he'd find on the street, he'd put it in his pocket, bring it home, put it in the pot. Yeah, he was quite the woodworker. He loved to make things with his hands. What? What is it? Oh, it's just a-- Did you get it? No. I hate fucking crickets. OK, I think you've got it. Jesus. Yeah, when my grandma laughed, she laughed so hard she almost swallowed her dentures. She raised me. I don't remember my parents. I don't care to remember my parents. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. - You mentioned before that you had a nervous breakdown? What was that like? - It was a walk in the park. It was a cake walk, piece of cake with a peace of mind. Georgia on my mind. It was a blast. Literally. What do you mean, literally? Were you injured in the blast? No. Anyone you know? Did you see any action? - I saw people killed. That's what you really want to know, isn't it? Did you kill anyone? - Yeah. Will you tell me about it? - When you tell me how you like taking it up your ass. Got to be hard being a female soldier in Iraq. - It's even harder being a female in the latrine. - Let's cut. - Did you get it? Did you get it? Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I should have fucking stopped. Made her stop. No, the snow is too strong and I cannot drive. - Well, if you like you shouldn't push yourself, you don't. I can't believe this isn't getting into festivals. Shh, quiet. That's my name. That's it. It's heartwarming, isn't it? - So I've had a lot of festivals sort of inquire. Nothing solid yet, but-- - OK. - You guys ready for apple cobbler? - Fuck. You want to see-- have you ever seen this video? - Hit play. Now here's a real documentary. You ready? - Glock 23, 33 round magazine. Oh, man. I wish I shot this one. Boom. Oh, my God. That's not funny. Oh, her. - This one. Look, look. - I love her. She's like, what? Oh my God. I've never seen that one. - Oh. Shit. No, look. That was a view. OK, so here we are. This is the first day of the rest of Bikini's life. Day treatment, day one. - Back to school. Mandatory fun. I wish you were here. So I am filming all this for your little film. Great. Bikini, what do you expect from today? - They're going to help me get my head together. And then they're going to help me get a job repairing robots. And then I will be able to buy things and impress people. Is that good? Nice, Keens. I love this woman. She's a genius. - Good luck. Bikini, I made some kale and asparagus quiche. You want some? Is that my phone? - I love you so much. I love you so much. I love you, too, Trevor. I love you, too, Trevor. Mm-hmm. Oh, Kate. You're so nasty. It's just so nasty. It's just so nasty. Just so nasty. Get the fuck back. Get on the ground. Yes. Yes. Get back. Oh, I'm so happy. Oh, I'm just so sad. Oh, I'm just so happy. Oh, I'm just so sad. I did not have sex with that woman. And I didn't inhale, either. And I definitely ain't no hound dog. I just . I just . I just . Happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Trevor, - Get out of here. - Happy birthday to you. Make a wish. Happy birthday. - Thank you guys for renting me a pool. I'm sure you-- - We had it drained. Here. - Oh my God. Very cool. I knew I could see it in the bag. Thank you. You know, when I was little, I always felt bad when I didn't like a doll or stuffed animal that they give me. I felt really sorry for them. So I always tried to pay as much attention to the ones that I didn't like as to the ones that I did. - Wow. Is that for me? It is actually for George Clooney, but I was unable to locate him. Where is George? He's flying in in his helicopter. - Is this gold? Bikini, that's too expensive. Hey, nothing's too expensive for George Clooney. - What is that? Is that a cricket? The praying mantis is the oldest symbol of God. When you look into the eye of the mantis, you can feel the presence of God. Uh huh. There are over 2,400 species. And in ancient civilizations like ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, and Assyria, they were believed to have supernatural powers. That's really important in Turkish and Arabic and African cultures. And in France, when you're lost, the mantis points the way home. The mantis tells you to trust your instincts and act appropriately. Go forward or retreat. Pounce or be pounced on. It's all about the power of calmness, balance, patience, silence. Thank you, Bikini. - Yeah. All right. You got the power now. Bikini! Make some noise for Trevor, guys. I know. But today is Trevor's. And tomorrow is Ashley's birthday. It's my daughter's. Next year, we will celebrate both birthdays together. Are you Krishna? Yeah. - Yeah, right. We got to get a bag for these things. - Yeah. No, that's not-- no, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. Listen to me. You don't understand, OK? I don't think she has a daughter. I don't think she has a husband. I don't think she has a child, for that matter. I think she made it all up, you get it? Shh. I don't think that's fair. It doesn't matter what you think. The woman is crazy. OK? I feel sorry for her. Trevor, I just-- I'm so tired. What about the car, OK? I think it's really time that we got a new car. I'm sending you a link. - It sure is sunny out here. Hey, I want you to know that I'm never letting you go again. OK? - OK. Maybe Aunt Kate's going to help us buy a house, huh? We're going to have a really nice house, with a big yard and big, tall trees. And I'm going to grow tomatoes. And you're going to have a bunny, a big white bunny, or a couple of them, you know? But if we have a couple of them, then we'll probably have dozens of them soon because-- I have an idea. - --they breed like rabbits. Mom? - Yes? - Why aren't you married, like Aunt Kate and Uncle Trevor? - Why aren't I married like Aunt Kate and Uncle Trevor? OK, listen to what I'm saying to you. When you go on a date with a guy, you don't kiss him on the first date or have sex. OK? - OK. - OK, but if you really like him, then it's fine if you kiss him on the first date. But other than that, you don't go any further than that. That's the talk. - Mom? - Yes? - Your eyes gave me another idea. - Another idea? - But this one, we're going to cheat. - OK. Here, put these on. I'm so proud of the Bikini. I think we can all be proud of what's happened here. It took a while, almost a year. But she did it. Her energies are aligning and she's overcome the sense of being different and of feeling alone. We doubted her. We doubted that she even had a daughter. We thought that it was all just a figment of her imagination, that she was delusional or it was part of her illness. But we were wrong. She's been in treatment. And it's working for her. Oh, oh yeah. She got a job. Yeah. She works in a supermarket now. Of course, she's a little bit overwhelmed. Wouldn't you say so, Bikini? - Things are good. Things are very good now. But today I am really happy. - Throw this away-- Jesus Christ. Now there's room. Got some-- What's going on over here? What's going on over here? You want to go for a ride? I got a little girl! Careful! I got your footsies. - I got you. I got your footsies. I spy with my little eye-- are you walking those over to me? Can I try? Cool. Hey, take this with you. Take your truck back. - OK. Take your airplane back. Take your train. Somebody's at the door. Uncle . - Oh my God. Hi, Kate. Igor, what did you-- how did you-- what are you doing here? - I came to wish you a happy birthday. - But it's not my birthday, Igor. - I wanted to see you. I just got back. - Oh, you went home. That's great. - You know this is my home, Kate. This is my home. - Yeah, I know. I know. Of course, I know that this is your home. I know New York is your home. I haven't seen you in two years and I assumed you went home to see your mother. Oh, sweetie, what did you draw? - I drew a plane. - Oh, thank you so much. That's so pretty. Is that another one of your nutjobs? - Go play, OK. Hey, buddy. - Go play. - You have a toddler? Unbelievable. - Igor, I've told you so many times. Don't come here. I'm calling the cops. - Should I pretend like we don't know each other? You have a new pet now? You got tired of me? - No, that's not it. Look, you know that I care about you very much. - Is she mine? - Stop fucking filming me! - I do like this. You do like what? Who's a big girl. Oh, my goodness. World better watch out. Honey bear coming through. Listen, I love you. - To play, to play? - Yeah, we're going to go play. Yeah. - Yes. Let me see your teeth. It's important to have nice teeth. You guys ready for apple cobbler? - I just ate. Can you put a little bit more emotion into it? - OK. Look-- Do you have Ashley's gift? Yeah. Trevor's, too. - We got two birthdays to celebrate this year. Trevor's is today and Ashley's is tomorrow. We're going celebrate them together. Of course, they don't know that yet. It's a surprise birthday party. Or two. God, I can't believe it's been a year. - Shit. - Trevor didn't want to do anything for his birthday. But too bad. He hates surprises. There's Ashley. She's-- what's she doing? Hey, sweetie. Ashley. Ashley, sweetie, what are you doing out here? Where's your momma, huh? She's inside. - Oh, she's inside, huh? Can you take this? She's inside? What do you say we go find her? Yeah? OK. OK. Let's go in. Oh, it's locked. Are you going to help me open the door with the magic key? Are you ready? Blow. OK, let's go. Thank you. Shh. Should we keep rolling? - Ashley, come on. Come on. Mommy. What, no thank you for your services? Huh? Ah, that was so good. That one's got to go down. You know where my lighter is? Are we interrupting? - I thought you were at your grandmas. No, I was out getting you a birthday cake. - What? What did you expect? This is what you fucking wanted, right? She's here. Stop playing the fucking victim, please. Look at you. This is what you fucking asked for. Now you've got it, all your fucking strays in one house. Here I am. Where's the fucking turtle? Igor, fucking nut job Igor? You know what? You're the one with the fucking problem. You're the one who needs help. Look at you. You look so fucking sad. It's you, not me. Not her. - Fuck you. You fucking-- Fucking narcissistic piece of shit. You. - Good. Good. Good. Good. - Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. - Good. Fuck you. Damn you. - Get these fucking cameras out of my fucking face. Go fucking fuck yourself. Fucking asshole. Turn it off. Shut the fuck up. Fuck you. Fuck you. And fuck you, Krishna. - Fucking asshole. You're a prick. Get these fucking cameras out of my fucking face. Fucking asshole. - Turn it off. Shut the fuck up. - Fuck you. Cliche about documentaries is that you never know what's going to happen. Sometimes the worse the better, you know? The drama writes itself for you. After his birthday party, for some reason, Trevor lost interest in the film and he moved to L.A. - She simply walked out-- - And Bikini disappeared. - --while Trevor and I were still arguing. Naked. - So after a few months, I thought that if we could finish the film, we could afford to pay the crew. - I know that she can't be held fully responsible for her actions, but I really thought that she was doing better. She simply walked out while Trevor and I were still arguing. Naked. Never came back, never called. Ashley stayed with me for a while, but Children's Services got involved, and they took her. So she's back in foster care now. Do you ever wonder where Bikini is? - Come to think of it, I should've seen it coming. I mean, she was off her medication, so. Would you do it again? - Yeah, I think so, yes. Why? - Why, what do you mean why? You're always trying to save people. - Well, she deserves it. I mean, everybody deserves help when they need it. What kind of question is that, anyway? Bikini! Hey. Hey. Bikini. Hi. Hi. Hey, hey, hey. It's me, Krishna. Remember me? Where have you been? I've been looking all over the place for you. I've checked everywhere. Where are you staying? - Oh, shit. Yeah. It's been a while. Six months or so. Are those your medals from Iraq? You know, I'm directing the documentary now. I really want to talk to you. Bikini, are you OK? Do you regret letting us film you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know her. She comes here a lot. Now, I don't know where she lives. Well, she's-- she's got problems, you know? I give her some bread at lunchtime every day. One day she stole a bag of sugar. I didn't care. Come on. What? No thank you for your service? Hey, blondie. What was your name again? You have a name? Hey. Who am I? - Oh. I scalped you. - Oh, how about that. - Bikini scalped Blondie. That's not funny. I got to go. - Wait. OK. Here. - Just let me go. - Here, here. Don't spend it on a new scalp. Go buy your kid something. Yeah. - If I had my kid with me, I'd be buying her something every day. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - Staying alive. - Do you see Ashley? - Sometimes. - Good. That's good. I have supervised visits. Do you? I live for them. - Well, I'm glad Krishna was able to set this up because he's been working really hard. He's been trying to-- I mean, we left things so-- I'm not expecting an apology or anything, but-- I worry about you. - I'm sick of you worrying about me. I got to go. - Wait. Are you in touch with Trevor? My friends are waiting for me. - OK. OK. I'm sorry. My real friends. They invited me into their house. They live in the dark, but they feel each others' warmth. And they know when a friend is sad. - That's nice. Are you taking your medication? Look, it's your fucking life. If you ever want to get Ashley back, you better start taking your medication. You need to take better care of yourself, OK? - Why would I be in touch with Trevor? There she is. - Hey. Hey, honeybear. How are you, honey? Huh? How are you? Did you make any new friends since last time, huh? Where do I-- - On this line. - OK. Thank you. Do you like it here? Hmm? Mommy loves you very much. You know that, don't you? Don't you? Come here. Hey. Mommy loves you more than anything in the world. Anything. Hey, look. I love you from here to the sky and back. Look, I've brought you some presents. Do you want some presents? Hold on. I have-- what do you think about that? And then there's also the-- OK. OK. Do you want to sit and I can show-- OK. Look. It's all insects. And if you-- there's your favorite. It's a mantis. And you can color her-- you can color her green. - No, a praying mantis is pink. - No, it's a praying mantis, so it's going to-- it's green. - No, a praying mantis is pink. - No, it's green. - Pink. - No-- all right. OK. It's pink. Here. Oh, but you know what? You know who's green, though? Hey, look. Your old mantis is green. Lokie's he's green. - Lokie! - Lokie. Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can I take her to the bathroom? She really needs to go. Down the hall on the right. - Thank you. Oh. Here you go. - Y'all OK in there? Mother-- shit. Get her. Get that child. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, my-- she's getting away. Go. Get me a-- Here, here. Come back. Yeah, this is a police emergency. Oh my God, Bikini. No, don't do this. No, 'cause she didn't hear me. Did you hear me? I don't think she's coming. I need you. For what? - I really fucked up this time. Look, I'm going to lose her if-- What-- - Bikini Moon Davis, Katherine Lydia Skylar, follow me. - I made you a bed here just to let you have your own space. Anyway, it's better than that storefront, so. Are you-- are you going to be OK here? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, it's not ideal, but I think it's better. I cleaned it up really well. - No, no. It's great. And it's better this way. I really appreciate it. Thank you. - Yeah, well-- - No, no, really. Thank you. Back home, nobody would have done anything like that for me, so. - Well, your grandmother would have helped, no? - Well, sure. She didn't stop beating me until I punched her in the face. After that, she stayed away from me and I stayed away from her. - You punched your grandmother in the face? - She wasn't some nice little old lady baking cookies. Nah, she was a mean, drunk hag. - Yeah. Well, children need to be with their mothers, so. - Look, I hope Ashley grows up to trust people more than I do. - Well, good night. Shit, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. Here, it's the top button. Could you please help us? I lost my money. I need two dollars for the subway. - All that I have. I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Ali. - Thank you. - Where are you from? - I didn't show up. I fucking emailed. Bullshit, man. What the fuck is that jacket? - It's a protective jacket because I bought a motorcycle. How do you feel about this? How do you feel about that? - Can you stop, please? Just stop. Oh, come on, man. I'm just doing what the fuck you told me to do. And I'm filming. - Great, great. Great. Just cut it out. Just cut it out. Kate, please can you tell her to stop? Yeah, it's based on a true story, huh? You know what? That's not the point right now. You cannot have my life back. - I don't want your fucking life. I just want my film back. You don't get to have your fucking film back-- Guys, guys. --because you fucked up, dude. KATE: Guys, guys, guys! Can we please just try and solve this amicably? Why? I'm trying. - Look, look. I think that it's only fair if Trevor gets the footage that he directed. Thank you. Oh, really? - Since he-- Since when are you on small dick's side, huh? - No, am I not taking anybody's side. Oh, yes you are. - I just think that there's a way-- there's a solution here-- Listen to what I'm saying to you. You don't get to have my fucking life. Krishna is now directing the film and he's not going to give you the fucking footage. It's over, dude. - Krishna's not paying for the fucking film, Kate is. And she said I can have the film back. So why don't you get-- What the-- Little bitch. - She has her good days and her bad days. Medication seems to help, but I don't know. Sometimes she's just out there in Bikini-land. I told my mother. Yeah. I think she'll understand eventually. Oh, Bikini made me a table. Yeah, she actually-- she does nice work. She's good with her hands. It was a surprise for my birthday. Not that I need another table, but-- It's a little wobbly. - Making a cabinet for Katie. I stay here and she stays there. It's not easy. I mean, it's not bad. It helps where it matters. I do get to see Ashley once a week. I'm back to supervised visits. So Kate comes with me as my spouse. And we are a solid family. I'm just hoping to get full custody of my daughter. I'm waiting for the courts to decide. Live fresh. Bikini, you let me know if this is getting too personal. Slow down. How are you doing? - How am I doing? I will be better when I get my daughter back. Going to be whole again, you know? I was in labor for 16 hours and they said that I was unsuited to take care of her. So I feel like an impostor living in this house. But it's better than being homeless, right? - Well, no, it sucks to be homeless, Krishna. So basically, this is how you would field strip a Beretta 9 millimeter. First thing you want to do, put that down. On the other side, there's a button. Press that button. That comes out. OK. Next, you release your magazine. Take your magazine out. You want to pull back your slide, check the chamber, make sure there's no bullets in there. Then you want to pull the slide back up and forward. And the slide comes off. And it's simple as that, really. Not so difficult. Yep, that's it in a nutshell. Sherman, I was wondering-- I was just thinking, when you die, does this seem real, or does it seem like a dream? What I mean is, how do you know when something that seems real is not real? - I don't know. What do you think? - Well, I don't know. What do you think. Well, I don't know. - Stop it. - Tada! Hey, hey, hey, careful. Don't fuck this up, man. - This is Krishna's film. - Yes, it is. - Guys, it is not easy being a movie star. - No, Bikini is a star. We are just the-- we're supporting characters. - Oh, hey, Bikini. - Mm-hmm? - Tomorrow, TJ, right? It's your custody hearing, your court date for Ashley, right? - Do you like my dress? Do you like my-- Oh say can you see? - I sure can. - By the dawn's early light. - Whoa. - So proudly-- let's all do it. I love that song. - You know, frankly, if I weren't gay-- look at you. - Wait, so have you ever been straight? - What? - What? I want to know. I just want to know. - What? - If you were to get a blowjob from a woman-- - What? - --would you get a hard on? OK, I call foul. - No, no, no, no. This is great. This is great. Come on. Would you, Sherman? Come on. What? I don't think so. Even with your eyes closed? - Even with my eyes closed? Wait, wait, wait. What about that busty redhead? Remember, like two years ago? - I don't know that I would call that a hard on. - You're busted. - Shush. - Well, what would you call that? - Oh, you're blushing. - I got to hit the head. I mean, excuse me. I need to powder my nose. - Oh, yes, little lady. - I'm a little debutante. - Oh my God. Oh my God. What are you doing? You scared me. OK, stop, stop, stop. We have to get up early tomorrow. - Please, please, please, please. I really want to. OK, I'm just going to-- just going to-- - Stop. - What? - Just-- - The camera crew. They're filming us. - I don't care. OK, that-- - I think this one. - I think that one. I think the green's going to be too much. - What do you mean? You picked the both of these out. - OK. No, I think you're right. I think the green's better. It's twisted. - Thank you. - Hide the tag. Yeah. Great. Looks good. - Yeah. - We've done all the right things. We've been married for eight months now and we're confident that things will work out because, well, things always work out in the end. How are you feeling, Bikini? You think the judge is going to award custody? Excited to get Ashley back? It'll be great to have her at home again. Fuck! Miss. I cannot believe this shit. Bikini-- That's not what was supposed to happen. This is fucking bullshit. The case is not over yet, OK? Miss. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Miss. - You lied to me. - No, I didn't. I'm so sorry. - You all lied to me. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - You need to calm down, miss. - I did not lie to you, OK? Look, I'm just as upset as you are. Hey, hey! - No way, man. No way. That's my daughter and you don't know what that feels like. You don't know. - Don't get angry. Don't get angry, OK? You need to keep calm. You need to take this outside. - Please, please, please. Just keep calm. Just know that we can fight this. - Eight months of living with you. Eight months of living with you. For what? Miss. - That's not fair. Miss. - You motherfucker. You motherfucker. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop. Stop, stop, Bikini, stop. Don't you . Don't you fucking . Fuck you. Don't you . Stop it. Bikini, stop. Fuck you. Stop, get off of me. - I mean, it's just-- it's sad. Look, I'm glad that Bikini is not in jail. Here. Arms. Arms, arms, arms, arms, arms. But still, I mean, I just-- I don't understand some of the choices that she's made, she just keeps making. OK, so we found out that her medals from Iraq were for real and she did have a nervous breakdown. Look, I know. I know that she's ill and she needs help. But still, I just-- I don't think she cares. I'm glad you were finally able to sell the footage-- --and pay the crew. I mean, fingers crossed you can tell the documentary now to PBS or even Sundance. Look at my little stockbroker. You look so good. I mean, especially with all the publicity. Happy Halloween, Uncle Krishna. What is this? Happy Halloween, Ashley. What is this? What did you draw? What did you draw? - Oh, it's a table. It's a table? That is so good. That is such a good table. Kate, when is your adoption of Ashley going to be finalized? - Honey bear, let's go trick-or-treating. - Yeah. - Yeah, OK. Stop filming. Let's go. Bikini is wonderful. She's so funny and she's so generous and she's so charming and she's so eloquent. And she's beautiful. And she saved me from my addiction. You know that I used to be an addict and now I'm not because Bikini saved me. I own this hospital, you know what I mean? Yes? You know what I mean? Whatever. Out of darkness, light. My friends live in the dark. They feel each other's heat. And they know when a friend is sad and they know when a friend is in need. They are gentle and-- they are gentle and they are misunderstood. And they live in happy families. I would like to introduce you to my friends now, OK? Yes? - Sure, yeah. - OK. - Where? - There. Oh, you need to be very, very careful. There's a lot of surveillance cameras. Look, Sotheby's has auctions. The NSA, the CIA, and Mark Zuckerberg, they all bid for your images taken by the surveillance cameras. Is your film going to be black and white? Citizen Kane, then. That's real filmmaking. Did you like that one? Have a seat. Go. Go. - Bikini, what is this place? It was only a movie, Ingrid. Here. What, you still don't drink? Such a sweet little girl, Krishna. I got a present for you. One day I'm going to take you to the zoo. And this one is Carando hickory smoked. Want to try? It's good. Here. Have a beer. Bikini, aren't you cold? She's all yours, even though you won't drink with us. Bikini, look, I'm here. We're going to get you back on your meds. You're going to be just fine, OK? It's going to be OK. Would you come with me please? I promise. It's OK. She won't hurt you. He's shy, aren't you? That's my friend, Krishna. He's cute, isn't he? It's OK. He won't hurt you. Let him touch you, OK? Easy. Easy. Show him how sweet you are. There you go, honeybear. Today is my birthday. Let's go out. Let's celebrate. I know just the place to go.
