I didn't lay a finger on the purse! Kyler, enough! - Hi. - Yo. So, all right, I gotta make this quick. Back in Texas, I had this neighbor who loved to invite strange Mexican families into her home for dinner. Well, sometimes it was breakfast and lunch, but what tripped me out were that these families were all fresh off the street. Like, they were all homeless. All right, Garrett, I called you out here about the Encomienda System. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just listen. So after some time, I start noticing changes on her property. Like I'd get back from school, and there'd be a new water fountain in the front yard, or brand new windows, and one time, a whole picket fence. She was putting the Mexicans to work? Yeah, they painted the house inside and out. Mate. Oh, the arse on that totty is unmatched. Oh. Hello. Shame there's no vaccine to fight against dumb. But she is stunning, stunning. If vanilla's your flavor, man. Now the Encomienda System. All right, you have this labor force, okay, who's working for like... TJ, quick! Chocolate or vanilla? Kyler, if you don't put me down, I'm gonna produce something chocolate from one end or the other. Should've known chocolate was your thing. No, no, no. How about a brownie, then? That's called a wedgie. Not if you don't wipe your ass, you dirty shit. Stop, Kyler. The bullying tactics again, guys? Oh no. Don't you think you're better than this? Not me, no actually. I am. Yeah? Yeah, in fact I was just telling Kyler here about an extremely romantic neighbor I used to have, who would have wonderful candlelit dinners with those she cared deeply about. Mexican strays you called them. Oh. This is your routine? Chum, I thought here in the States, it went a bit more like this. Hey, hey. Fancy a magic trick? - Huh? - Fine. Let's see it. Hold out your hand. Come on, come on. ♪ The galaxy, the universe tried everything to make it work ♪ Isn't this magical? Cute, but no. Oh, come on. And you should get back to class. Garrett can't solve all your problems. Yeah, obviously. I don't need your help, all right? All right, but I need yours, mate. So could we get back to the Encomienda System? Dude, my neighbor was repaying the Mexican families with sexual favors. That's how she got arrested and has been in jail ever since. The Encomienda System. Oh. Shit. We good? - Now why's that wanker Ms. Michaels making us write about such a manky topic? US History, man. Sounds a bit more like European history if you ask me. And as fate would have it, I do believe that's the woman's purse. Such a daft cow, that woman. Leave Ms. Michaels alone. Besides, you know she's gonna be right back. She sunbathes every day during her prep. But she never leaves her purse behind. She's forgotten it. All right, well, have at it, I gotta get back to class. Oh, come on, mate. I'll bet it's loaded with cash. Come on, I'll split it with you. Kyler, you're not serious. C'mon, mate. What's the worst that could happen? ♪ Running with the boys, running with their bullshit ♪ Oh, AC's busted. Look, I know it's like 100 degrees outside, but it'll be worse inside with the dust mites. Besides, Satan's spawn should feel right at home. Welcome to Saturday School. Come on. ♪ Knock it out the park when I'm sick and in the bull pen ♪ ♪ I'm too ahead of my time ♪ ♪ You could have been on my line ♪ ♪ Can't do it better than mine ♪ ♪ I play the rhythm and die for every nickel and dime ♪ ♪ Because I'm sick in the mind ♪ ♪ Sick of my lyricism, intricate rhymes ♪ ♪ They wanna pick at it, try to rebut me ♪ ♪ Utterly a waste of their time ♪ This is a no excuse zone. All I need you to do is show up and do your work. I will provide everything you need. So what are we doing here? In life? No idea. I was hoping maybe one of you shitheads could tell me. Ms. Michaels, don't you think it's a bit excessive to be calling us names? Oh, I see. I see that you see the urgency in finding respect for yourself when your little feelings are hurt. But when it comes to your grades, honor, and dignity, who needs self respect, huh? My grades are fine. As are your bank accounts, right? I ain't take shit. Excuse me? With all due respect, ma'am, I think you've lost the plot a bit. If your superiors have already grilled us over the matter and we say we didn't do it, we didn't do it. The only thing you didn't do was your schoolwork, ever. Now, there was a purse and then there wasn't. School cameras show five of you in the area when the purse was taken. Five students out of 1,700. Oh, so unfortunate mistakes. But what the camera didn't show is which one of you is sticky fingers. So then why are we here? To do your six weeks. Look, now we can either come clean or we can all stay and get dirty. Anyone? I don't know about the rest of them, but I took a shower this morning. Does that mean I can leave? But you missed in between your ears, toots. Let's start with the ice breaker, shall we? This is bullshit. Bullshit? That game is quite a conversational starter. But today we're gonna play something called the lies, the truth, and the absurd. Care to do the honors, England? No. I'm sober right now. I love my job. I married my cousin? There's no way this is real. Of course it's real. It's called an example, twit. I'd say "married my cousin" is the absurd. You've played this one before, huh? So then "I love my job" is the truth? There's no way this lazy sod actually loves her job. Look at her. She's clearly hammered right now. Oh, so now you care? Well, how hot was the cousin? Ew, no. Look, maybe she gets her enjoyment from watching us suffer. No way. You never know. This could all be an act. If the nutter had a pistol, she'd off herself in front of us. This is ridiculous. Dude, that's a little harsh. I know, man, and I don't want to be, I know... I married my cousin. Sober right now. I love my job. The truth, the lie, and the absurd, in that order. Cousin through marriage. I overheard her talking about it in the office last week. What's a ninny like you doing in the office? Oh, tummy ache, ay? Kyler and Sky, you two are partners, okay? Scarlett and that other motherfucker. And TJ, you got me. But first let's take a break. Lord knows I need one. Hope this helps alleviate some of your anger issues. Did I do something to you? Yeah, I'd say around 17 years ago when you outpaced 100,000 other sperm. No way your mom kisses that mouth of yours. My mom's dead. No, I never knew my father, and after my mom, I've just been moving back and forth from England with my aunt ever since. Look, if you need someone to smack a few balls around with, I'll be your test dummy. How 'bout a shag? I thought girls still had cooties to second graders. Or is there something you wanna tell me? You think I fancy you? No, I'd rather stick this racket so far up my arse than to have a go with you. Do you plan on being an asshole for every assignment? Well, I am known for other parts of my body. Look, I wanna be done with this place. Okay, so can we at least agree to be serious while we're working? Let me get something straight. This country is run by celebrities, your schooling systems are run by drunks and potheads, yet you want me to be serious about my education? Well, yeah. You should find yourself a new partner. So I'm gonna say that your lie is you do 100 one-armed push ups a day. But don't be mad because it's totally obvious that you work out. Your absurd is you took the cash out of Ms. Michaels's bag. And your truth is you've already been accepted into Harvard and Mitt. MIT? It's okay, sometimes I have trouble spelling too. Garrett! Huh? So are you gonna tell me if I got the answers right? Have you ever liked someone who doesn't even notice you? I'm sure I've been there before. So if you were me, what would you say to get Sky to notice you? To get lost. What? Look into her eyes when you're talking to her. See if you can look inside and see how tender her heart is. And maybe you can tell him how much you adore his gorgeous smile. Scarlett, you have a thing for Kyler? Her. I meant you can tell her how much you adore her gorgeous smile. Got it. You didn't steal the purse. I know because you're a terrible liar. Having sex with over 100 guys is absurd for anyone who doesn't live on a Las Vegas ranch. And I think it's true, you don't deserve your reputation for being a slut. We done? "I don't like girls." That's my truth. At all? Sometimes on Tuesdays. What you gonna do when it's time for you to have kids? I don't really think they'd fit out my butthole, Ms. Michaels. Look, if you know who took my money, why don't you just tell me, and let me get you outta here? Maybe that's not his truth. That doesn't seem to be any of your truths. I mean, Kyler here's a quack, you girls are clueless, and, well, TJ here is a gay. What, Garrett, you gonna tell me you think he's cute? So, can we go now? Sure, leave. I mean, whether you leave now or at the end of the day, we better get used to the sound of each other's voices. Because if y'all don't run me my money, or give me a better effort around here, I'm gonna be scheduling a few more Saturdays. I didn't take the purse. That must be the lie. Oh, I'm certain it would take someone who spends the day on her back to know. That must make your attitude the absurd. Get over yourself, TJ. I know exactly how to say I'm not a thief. Is thief spelled T-H-I-E or T-H-E-I? Scarlett, come on, you're better than that. I before E except after C. T-H-I-E, oh. ♪ And on his farm he had some chicks ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-ho ♪ Pretty sure Old MacDonald had some pigs too. What's the old sod got you into today? Gotta plead our case. Let the rogue cop know our leading suspects. We need a pencil for that? Would you like to see an assignment that would motivate you to use one? Actually, I do. Care to have a go at a runner? The last thing I wanna do in this heat is go for a run. Hey. Kid, get off the gay porn and do tell me how the Americans say scurry off, no, not scurry off. Run away. Escape? That's it. And what if she wakes up? I'm sure we can leg it back before the drunkard even realizes what day it is. Now shall we have a go? Or are you too posh for your own request? Posh. Really need to get one of those British translation dictionaries. Thanks, man. Are you sure you know where you're going? Positive. All right. I believe you call this Spin the Bottle in the States. But I like mine with a little twist. What you guys gonna do, you're gonna write down any question or dare you can think of. Write it down. Gotta spell it right. Here you go. Thanks, man. Dude, I gotta ask, is that a diary? No, it's a journal. Okay. Can dish it, but can't take it? Oh, do your worst. Anyone who doesn't answer or perform the dare, must drink. Unless cowardice has already overtaken this country. I think we'll stick with the dares. Or whatever else is in the damn bottle. All right. Come on, Betty, better put up or show up, right? Let's see, we've got "Take off an article of clothing." This your work? Guess cowardice spread from England. Contagious much? Come on, buddy, what you gonna do, what you gonna do? Contagious? Oh! Smells a little contagious. That's disgusting. Dude. What? That's lame, gross. "Kiss Kyler." Oh, are we doing it or what? Do it, do it, do it. Just give me the bottle. Wow. Talk about lame. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Yum. All right, hand me the bottle. Here you go. "Sky or Scarlett?" Oh, brilliant! I guess we know who wrote that one. Sky. Aww! Geez, come on, let's go. Scarlett. Why are we doing this again? Oh. 'Cause we got nothing else to do? Fine. "Kiss." What's it say? "Kiss Kyler." Here she comes. O for two, Kyler. Well done. Oh, TJ! TJ, let's see it. It's okay to breathe, buddy. Yeah, just... That's how friends hang out. Yeah, come on, loosen up a little bit, man. Maybe he needs a shot or two. I ain't kissing no Kyler. Hey, hey, hey, just because he likes guys doesn't mean he likes you, man. I mean, you always have always been prettier than I. Just hand him the bottle already. I hate the suspense. Just let me get it over with. Let's see. "Remove an article of clothing." Just give me the bottle. Oh, come on! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you always think you're better than everybody around you? - Oh! - Oh! Seems that way. Yeah, posh, right? - Totally posh. - Posh. Oh. ♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪ ♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪ ♪ I love you, I love you ♪ All right, cover yourself up. Made your point. Come on. What's in the box? Mock trial, with a twist. Guys are girls and girls are guys. Then you'll argue until I'm satisfied. Why do we have to switch genders? Why can't we just be ourselves? Because I don't like you. I figured that. There you go, that's you. How many people have you been with, Garrett? It's Garretta, sweetie. Ms. Michaels, if he isn't gonna be taking this seriously, then what's the point of this activity? Sustained. Answer the question, Garretta. Two. How does it feel to be a slut? I've been with two people in my life, and that makes me a slut? Yeah, it does. So if I'm a slut, what's that make someone like you? Am I supposed to be asking the questions or what? Sustained. Answer the question, Garrett. It feels unfair. How can I be a slut when I don't even feel like I know what I'm doing in the bedroom? Hey! You like it when I can see everything, don't you? No! And if you do it again, I'm gonna treat you like that mustache is real. Oh, the fiesty kind. You mean it makes you uncomfortable when I touch you without your permission? Yes, I do. And it's called self respect. Can I ask a few questions now? Overruled! Sky and TJ, you're up. So, how many people have you been with, Sky? Jesus, you guys don't have any other questions? We're high school students. Touche. Sky? None. I guess you could say I'm saving myself for the right person. Oh, so you're a lame? A lame? Mm-hmm, a nerd, a geek, a dork. How does saving myself for someone special make me a dork? Can I have a go at this? Objection! Seriously? Sorry, Sky, fair is fair. Fine. No, I'm not a lame. Come on, Ms. Michaels. I have somethin' to say here. A bit late to the party, aren't we? How can I be sure that you're even serious? Ms. Michaels, this is excessive! Overruled. Ms. Michaels, can I at least have a run at a few questions now? Garrett, running from your problems isn't going to solve anything. Maybe if you looked around, you might realize that the answers are staring you right in the face. I don't know what you're talking about. I answered every single one of your questions. The least you could do is answer a few of mine. Fine, what questions do you have for me? Well, they're more for Sky actually. Ms. Michaels! TJ, knock it off! You okay with me calling you a lame, even when you say you ain't one? Of course not, idiot. Easy, Sky! Were you even aware that boys get bullied for their lack of sexual experience? Well, yeah, that's why... I'm listening. That's why so many of them lie about it. What kind of advice would you give someone like me? I would say to be patient. You'll know the right person when you meet them. And someone like Kyler? First of all, I would tell him to be on time. Because if he can't be on time to the things that matter, when he opens his eyes, he's going to realize the things that matter to him have expired. Hey, you said you had something to say. Hopefully, you can do it in a manner that isn't too curt, or brusque as you teens so typically do. All right, I'll be here from now on. Ms. Michaels, class. I'm serious. And we're off. See you after the break. Make you feel any better? What's that supposed to mean? You seem a little upset, that's all. Had another row with me aunt yesterday about the bloody dishes again. I can't figure it out. I wash the dishes by hand, she gets on me about putting them in the washer. When I put 'em in the washer, she wants me to take my time with washing them by hand. Can't win. What? You wash dishes? Well, of course. Unless you expect the swine to starve. No. The swine, I mean, I realize you have to eat. No, me aunt, she works such long hours. I can only stomach so much pepperoni from the dumpster outside Fred's Pizza sometimes. You don't? Why wouldn't I? Because it's a dumpster, Kyler. What, so you agree with them? Agree with who? What, you think we still hold a grudge against the French? When me stomach growls, and the adults around are too busy and want me to figure it out. But I come up with me plan, I'm no different than a tosser, as far as they can tell. I can't figure 'em out. Well, you can't just go around eating germ-infested food, Kyler. Some things you should know on your own. It's those expectations that bring pressure, don't you think? If they're being too hard on you, yeah. But I'm pretty sure they don't wanna see you suffer. No man with half a wit is eating out of a dumpster, but how can they not see the pressure they put me under to perform successfully is shaking me confidence? Hard to get me timing right. Do they even know what you want? I mean, in life? I don't know. It's hard to jump off a bridge for them, when you don't know if they have your back or not. Do you know what you want? I think I do. Well, you probably should be 100% sure. In case the parachute fails during the fall. Who wants to kiss a boy anyway? Ms. Michaels? This better be good, you interrupting my nap and all. You're holding a newspaper. I take it in the bathroom too. Doesn't mean I'm reading it. Gross. Doesn't the newspaper leave scars in your butthole? I was wondering what you'd like... Why TJ's still wearing a skirt over there? I thought we were clear. The boy likes rainbows. You know what, if you don't put that phone down, I'll be taking it. We are testing, you know. Actually, I was just wondering what you'd like us to do if we finish early. I'm glad you asked. You can get yourself stretched out and head on over to the track. Starting with you, Garrett. ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ What is this meaning ♪ ♪ I live my life but it seems ♪ ♪ I can't predict ♪ Hey. We're here because of you. The least you could do is keep running. Well, I never trained much for track and field, okay? So you're gonna have to forgive me of my mistake. Cheating isn't a mistake. It's a choice. Oh, you pick that up in Elle Magazine? Get off my back, okay? I didn't know Ms. Michaels was gonna subject us all to such cruel and unusual punishment, okay? I mean, god, if I didn't know any better, I'd say we should hide from cheetahs in this fucking Serengeti. The way you're running, you'd be the first one eaten. You know what? Okay, fine, all right, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Are you happy now? What else do you want from me? Garrett, if I have to spell it out for you, maybe it's not worth wanting. When did you learn to spell? TJ, you're doing good, mate. Let me guess, good for a gay dude, right? TJ, I'm not trying to start with you back there. I guess I was trying to avoid this. I think we all know you're a glutton for punishment. I just wish you could come up with ways to keep me out of it. TJ, I haven't been that bad to you, have I? Kyler, you beat me up to make yourself look good in front of girls. And you got me out here sweatin' like one of Massa's runaways. I don't know what black people are like back in England. But here? Black folks don't do heat. Feel like we 'bout to pick some cotton or some shit. Whoa. Oi, hey. You've got a little soul in you, don't you? Never heard you utter more than a sentence. Yeah, you know what they say. It's the quiet ones you gotta watch. Did you take the purse, TJ? Actually, I was about to ask you the same question. What, me? You promise to be serious about your work, and all of 10 minutes later you're caught cheating? Sounds like the breadcrumbs of a serial liar. I don't even eat cereal for breakfast. All right? I've done a lot of things in my life, stealing ain't one of them. Why should we believe anything you say at this point? Believe whatever you want. But just know, those who point the finger have three pointing back at themselves. Delinquents! I'll see you next Saturday! I don't know how much more of her antics I can take. Not to worry, my good man. I got something that can numb the pain. Like what? Molly? So what else have you been hiding? Nothing any different than what's been stashed in your handbag. I bet I have way less to worry about in my backpack than you do in yours. How about you two just switch already? TJ. Kyler's reputation would be ruined if he was caught dead with a purse. Oh, maybe you could bring the murse back. This is stupid. You think I give a toss what's in your bag? A girl gives a guy a chance to go through her backpack, and he declines? Tell me you're willing to submit to the origins of cowardice. Fine, whatever. Can we just exclude my... Diary? It's not a diary, it's a journal. "Her laughter is the rhythm of my heartbeat. "One blink from her beautiful lashes sends a gust "of wind through my soul." "I'd die a thousand deaths to live 10 seconds with her." "Love envies her." Do you write? I mean, I draw a lil bit. Just give it to me. Kyler, you can really write. You did write that, didn't you? The attitude totally makes sense now. Look. Tampon, Sky? You literally walk around with a stick up your butt. Except it's up your... Yes, I think we get the point. Water balloons? What, are you turning nine? Don't sleep on a good birthday bash. You guys don't like goody bags? Scarlett? Not gonna lie. I live for the noisemakers. See? There are more ways to have fun than popping pills. All right, well, why don't you show us? I bet I can accept a challenge if you boys can.

She's sweet on you, mate. Ready? Toss. Scarlett, make sure you line up adjacent from him. Um, Sky, sweetie. There's no Jason here. His name's Kyler. Would it be wrong if I fired the next water balloon at her head? Might jumpstart a few neurons in her brain. And we'd score, so two birds with one stone. Dude, are you trying to lose?

I'm sick of his barking! Somebody needs to put this dog to sleep. No, I... A nap isn't gonna help, Garrett! But you both could use a leash. Kyler, stop, please. No, no, I don't need you to stop me from having a run-in with the bloke, all right? I can handle myself just fucking fine. Hey, hey, look at me. Why? Why?

And that is where the audience calls out a random theme and the actors on the stage stay married to it and give me the best performance of a lifetime. For better or for worse. Scarlett, TJ. Stranded on a desert island. Come on. And action! Thanks, TJ. Home sweet home. What are you talking about? We're shipwrecked. There's no food, there's no mirrors. And what are we gonna do without the gram? Oh, that's right. I almost forgot before Instagram how much time I wasted having to imagine what my friends looked like riding the bus. I'm serious, TJ. We could die out here. Scarlett. It's cold, it's lonely, and there's no toilet tissue. It's your wedding day! This is the happiest day of my life, papi! Papi? I thought I told you I didn't want no kids. You telling me you're pregnant? Well, that's what married couples do, TJ. Cookies on Christmas. Netflix and popcorn on Friday nights. And if you want to keep a smile on your face in the bedroom, summer vacations in Saint Tropez. Not if there's a little knucklehead inside you. What kind of man you know got time for a goddamn crumb snatcher? Especially, especially if it's a little boy. Lord knows I ain't got no time for no dumb-ass lil boy. Ms. Michaels. I don't think he's acting. Got it. Come on. You know what? Let's just scrap the rest of this assignment, okay? I'll see y'all next week. So I'm lying in the bed with this utter beaut, fast asleep. And keep in mind I'd been fantasizing for months about how I'm going to impress this girl. I had eggs, bacon, potatoes all ready for our morning feast together, right? And out of nowhere, me stomach starts gurgling. At three in the morning, mate. So how'd you weasel your way outta this one? I mean, as only a weasel would. I slipped me arm out from underneath her. I tiptoed through the front door. And I shat on the sidewalk beside her neighbor's gate. I left the poor girl with no food and I wiped me arse with me underoos. You should write books, man. You've got stories for days. I mean, what do you think I have in here? May I? "I won't pretend." "I cry, I bleed, I lie." "This is who I am." Haiku, right? Aye. This is deep. Like, how could you say you won't pretend, but then say you lie? It's like the perfect contradiction. - Because we're human. - Because we're human. Exactly. Yeah, I feel like it's my way of saying I'm gonna be myself even if it means being a fuck up. How's that working out for you? I think I'm still a fuck up. But I'm tryin'. I wish I had your confidence. Like no matter what they say to you or do, you just keep on truckin'. As do you. TJ, I've been knocking you down for shits and giggles a long time now. And you're still standin', lad. I mean, you've got my respect. For what it might be worth, but. You deserve better from me. We'll work on that. May I? Delinquents. Your attention please. "Dear Love, I see you," "but when I look back, you see a big red nose, "an upside down smile and a muted voice. "I bang on an invisible wall that surrounds me" "to inch closer to your warmth," "but I am silent to you. "I'm surrounded by roses, yet I'm oh so alone." "And you're on to the next." "Sincerely, Who Am I?" Kyler, your thoughts. You're asking Braveheart over there? What's he gonna tell you about love? Hey. Why so disrespectful? We're talking about a guy who paints his nails black for Valentine's Day. But he's not from Scotland, and that movie was about... A broken heart. "Surrounded by roses, yet oh so alone." The person writing this letter is a broken heart, right? Well, it's a gotta be a mime, Scar. Big red nose, upside down smile. Banging on walls without sound. It's like he's trapped inside a box to his audience, which serenades him with roses, but fails to realize he's dying to get out. To find love. I do agree with you that it is a mime, but only in a metaphorical sense. I believe the letter to love here is from TJ himself. That's stupid. How so? He likes boys. And now he's writing about clowns desperate for love? It's hypocritical. I mean, none of this shit makes any sense. The writer of that stupid letter might as well be Kyler himself. What, something you wanna get off your chest, mate? We can finish our little scrum right now. I got a few rounds in me. All I need is one. Ms. Michaels! If they want another Saturday with me, by all means. Come on. You know, screw this! Love, still undefeated. Interesting euphemism. But you are an interesting kid, so par for the course I guess. You know, I think I agree with Kyler that you were writing a letter to love. But what's unclear to me is who is this love that you're writing to? You know, TJ, I think if you're honest and open about your emotions, you might find out she likes you too. I don't like girls. In my history class, we've been talking about Manifest Destiny. Have you been paying attention? Americans believed it was their God-given right to move out west on the continent. Haven't missed a day of your US History class, Ms. Michaels. So what do you think would've happened to America without this belief? World peace? They probably would've never had a chance for expansion, and that means you might not be here. Would you be okay with that? Well, no. Thank you for sharing your opinions with me. You know, TJ, whether it's girls you like, or boys, or donkeys. Well, no, not donkeys 'cause that's just weird. But have some kids, sir. It would really be a shame if they were never here to share their opinions with you. Ms. Michaels? If you had something to get off your chest. And no, I'm not talking about that, but would you just come right out and say it? Those things have a way of coming out when they're supposed to. Now let's rally up the troops and you can help me to the dumpster, okay? In case last night's spaghetti or whatever is upsetting my stomach comes back up. - What? - I don't get you. Wouldn't expect you to. You're just like all the others. Excuse me? Look, why don't we just stop whatever we've got goin' on here before somebody gets hurt, all right? Hey. Am I going too rough for you? That poor baby worried about me stealing his lollipop. Are you on drugs, woman? If I'd have known we were still getting high, I wouldn't have tossed those pills for you. When you gonna realize you're good enough to start making the right decisions for you? What? What, now we're back in the second grade? You gonna tell all the kids to get me out in four square? Was my serve too rough for you? You wouldn't make it past the first square, right. Okay, maybe not, but I'd get right back in line until I did. You would, wouldn't you? Sure would. And I wouldn't go down without a fight. Is that what you're doing here? Right now? Well. I say if you're gonna cry, cry tears of victory. If you're gonna hate, hate that you can't find love. And if you find love, then love the joy, pain, and the fight that comes along with balancing both. Wow. I'm clearly not the only writer between us. You saw my work at the lake. Oh yeah, the notepad, yeah. Do you have any plans to write after high school? After college, maybe. But I'm not as good as you. What do you plan on doing with all that talent? Stop it. One has to actually graduate in order to plan for the future. Kyler, I'm serious. Everything you put onto paper is incredible. Wait. Has no one ever told you how good you are? Can we just change the subject? Wow. How've you gotten by all this time without anyone knowing how gifted you are? You think I'm gifted? Kyler, I've been writing my whole life. And I've never been able to come up with anything as thought-provoking and eloquent as you. She thinks me brilliant, all right! Okay, after graduation, we'll give the college bit a bit of a run. Oh, okay. And then we'll have a massive wedding, two kids, and then we're off to Hollywood. There. How about we start with finishing Saturday School? And maybe a little kiss right now. All right.

And today is starting to make boring look like a New Year's party. That was a good one, Scar. Yeah? Jeez. You tryin' to give us a heart attack, mate? If not, we'd die from heat stroke anyway. Might as well have a little bit of fun before we go. Okay, no one is going anywhere, and why do you have that bottle? Oh. Well, it's Kyler's. Last time, we barely put a dent in it, so I took it from your backpack. Hope you don't mind. My drinking days are over. So strip. Oh, no. You boys have seen enough. So, win. Let's play. What's the game? TJ, haven't you learned anything from the last time? It's not that I like the high life, but I haven't had that much fun in my life until that day. Also you guys were just complaining about how bored you were. Let's play. All right! So each one of us will take a turn being it. And the rest of us will huddle up and come up with a real secret of one of ours. The person who is it will have one chance to guess whose secret has been revealed. Okay. That's what I'm talking about. But we play by two rules. One, strip or drink if you guess wrong. Two, no lame secrets. Scarlett, no one cares that you bite your toe nails. But TJ, if you've had a thing with, say, an Auntie, now that's a secret worth drinking in the nude for. Oh, no thanks. I like chicks but not dicks. I volunteer for Scarlett to go first. Okay, this is stupid. And Kyler, why do you still have that bottle in your backpack? Old habits die hard. Fuck off. Fuck you. Hey, guys, just start the game. Sky. Are you good? Yes. Someone slapped your mom for a fucking. One of you slapped your mom for fucking your brother in a burning kitchen. Gotta be Scarlett. Girl, get your shit together. We said one of our moms slapped our brother for fucking up by nearly burning down the kitchen. That's what I said. Am I wrong if I smack sense into this bitch? - What? - She's drunk. Well, who was it? Oh, nailed it. TJ, you're up. Is anyone burning to offer up another secret? That's funny, 'cause I thought you were holding something back. Or maybe Scarlett has something to share. I mean... I lied about my truth. And while I haven't been with 100 guys, I have been with over 20. No shit? You're a walking HIV strand, you know? I knew my instinct was right to stay away from you. Garrett! Control yourself, mate. Come on. Dude, we don't have any cups. You can share the bottle with her, but I'd rather... I can put up with a lot of shit, but I won't tolerate the slut shaming. Not anymore. Okay, you know what, fine. All right, let's all just continue, shall we? Okay, champ. One of us has had sex with over 20 people. Take a wild guess on who. TJ, before you join team judgment, I want to make it clear that I love my sexuality. But from now on, whoever I decide to share myself with, they're gonna have to earn it. You mean they'll actually have to say please next time? Fuck you, Sky! I'm so sick of your shit, I feel like I'm the one who needs a toilet. Oh. You know, it's that attitude that puts pressure on girls like me to do whatever it takes to please our boys. You're always scoffing at our clothes, making assumptions about how we earned our grades, and probably mixing up the pot with rumors about people we didn't actually do. By the time we get a chance to hang out with somebody we're interested in, they've already made up their minds about us. Only choice we get is put up or shut up. But that's okay. Because I know the truth is you wish you could be me. No one who shaves their bikini line likes the thought of being a virg. Except for anyone who's slept with over 20 people. - All right, all right. - Chick fight. I don't wanna do this anymore. I said I wasn't going to do this anymore. Well, then stick to your word, psycho! I'm not! You know what? You guys can believe whatever you want. I'm a different person now. I know, Scar. Me too. Since we're all sharing secrets here, I guess this is a good time for me to tell you, I'm not gay. This is who I am. So you changed your mind? Just like that? You can do that? When you know what it's like to be hazed more for being a virgin than for being gay, then maybe we can talk. But until then, how 'bout you look into some sensitivity classes? That or, I don't know, maybe rehab. I guess it's safe to say you owe me a couple more Saturdays.

Just because you had one bout with liquid courage one afternoon doesn't make you any less boring, right? And I'm pretty sure Sky's not looking for vanilla. Are you sure your sex count isn't as high as, say, Scarlett? Oh, that's right. You lost count after 20. You might wanna keep your nose outta of my ass. No brown nosers here, my good man.

What, cat got your tongue? That pussy scratched my throat out. Too much singing, I guess. Well, save your voice. You're going to need it to silence Garrett here, who's under the impression that people don't deserve second chances. You in agreement? If that's the case, you'd all be in jail, with a cellmate named Big Boo. What's the point of all this? I thought you teens loved a good scrap. Normally, all you do is argue. Not interested in debating today? The debates. The acting and singing. You have us out here acting like clowns, and for what? What could you possibly gain from putting us through all this? You know, when Mike Tyson tries to knock a guy's teeth out, I'm pretty sure he's more focused on getting his hands on the championship gold than he's worried about how sore he's gonna be the next day. We're not your lab rats, okay? And who on God's green earth is Mike Tyson? Seriously, Garrett? I'm sure we've all fallen our asses once or twice trying to moon walk. Scarlett, I think that's Michael Jackson. Nobody said anything about auditioning for America's Got Talent, okay? We shouldn't have to do any of this. Do I hear a confession coming? I wouldn't dare steal from an old lady. 45 is not old! You're 45? Ms. Michaels, you should invest in some Botox. Oh, okay. Well. "It's always the quiet ones." "No doubt it was TJ." Scarlett, you think TJ took my purse, right? TJ, this was before I knew the real you. I know who took it. - Okay. - Oh, really? Well, when I asked you to write your alibi, all you wrote was three little words. "Take your pick." And now you want everybody to respect your voice, right? Ms. Michaels. Oh, okay. "Not only did I see Kyler bullying TJ "and talking to Garrett about cheating "on Ms. Michaels US History exam, "but I also was headed to the bathroom" "and I overheard him practically begging Garrett" "to steal the purse with him." I didn't write that to you. Oh, but you admit that you wrote it? To who, our principal, maybe? And Kyler. Kyler, you wrote nothing. Knowing damn well that you took food out of my family's mouth. And now you refuse to come forward in order to what? Protect your friends? I knew you went back for that purse. I don't have anything to do with it but you couldn't resist, could you? Kyler gets what Kyler wants. Isn't that right, Scarlett? Garrett, don't. Oh, you just sit down and listen, right? "She was as sweet as a peach, "with even less fuzz a few inches beneath her belly button. "Between the sheets, a gentle animal if you will. "By no means was I a lion tamer, "but I know it takes a true lion" "to please such an experienced sexual genius." "Scarlett." Sky, that was before you. Zip it. For a change. So, do we all still believe in second chances? Maybe you're right. I don't need a second chance from scum! I don't need a second chance from a drunk and I certainly don't need a second chance from a rat. Especially after I told all of you. I didn't lay a finger on the purse! Of course you did. Klepto Kyler in the flesh. Kyler, enough! Hey! If you cannot make it through Saturday School, this is your last chance. Hey, this is your future. The best you can do is cry? I think we're all capable of turning on the waterworks. Maybe you should try something different. Or are you just incapable of telling the truth? The hell are you talking about, TJ? I saw her take it. Is this true? Stop, Sky. You don't have to... I can't believe I put so much energy into you. You played us. I guess that concludes our debate. Could drive cross country in a week's time. That guy just can't get over himself. Or someone. I'm sorry, man. I should've told you. After all I've done to you? Stop it. Oh, so you're good? Because I was wondering if you would mind driving when Scarlett and I join you and Sky on a double date. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a tick. I'm done with Sky. Done. No, you're not. I've seen what happens when you're done with someone. It's black eyes for the guys. And it's jealous fits watching you move on to your next prospect for the ladies. You've been watchin' me, eh? Rule of thumb for geeks, always keep danger on your radar. See, that right there, that's what bothers me, TJ. You shouldn't have to do that. Live in fear? Especially not because of a numb bloke like that. I deserve everything I've gotten. Yeah, maybe. But you gotta take the good with the bad. And if the bad is Saturday School, then the good is Sky. She loves you, man. There's no hiding her feelings for you. We all saw that. What made you record her nabbing the ole lady's purse anyway? Like, how'd nobody see you? I'm not gonna lie, Kyler, I was really pissed off with you for messin' with me that day. So I went to the one place where I knew I could be by myself. The bushes. I saw the purse myself and I thought, hey, Ms. Michaels, she'll come back for it. Next thing I know, Sky popped up. And I'm thinking, okay, maybe she's gonna take it to her. But the way she kept looking over her shoulder as she went through it gave me weird vibes, so I hit the red button. Why didn't you tell? I mean, before. Guys like me don't have much to do on the weekends. So I figured I'd tell when I got bored or I got tired of being here. But to be honest, you keep things pretty interesting wherever you go. And then I saw how much you liked her and I figured things would blow over once Saturday School was over, but I couldn't let them blame you, you know? I didn't take the purse, but somehow I still feel like this is all my fault. We all played a part in it. Yeah, and Scarlett? Casualty of war. Wow, it looks like someone just ate your puppy. Wait. I look horrified? Or are you trying to tell me I look horrible? I know my homophones. But... And I know when a girl needs a friend. You're here because of me, and you wanna be my friend? I don't deserve you. Aww. Listen, I know when your idols become your rivals, it can be hard to go back again. But look at you. You so look up to me again. That's a big step. I was so hoping we could get a selfie together. Yeah. And I promise I won't record you. Babe, we seriously need to work on your smile. Anywho. For what it's worth, I know you're a good person. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Way deep in there, there's a little girl dying to love someone. And it may not seem like it right now, but he's dying to love you too. Just give it some time. Thank you, Scarlett, that's really nice. I'm sorry I put my hands on you. Don't worry about it. My words were just as bad. I deserved worse, I'm sorry. Okay, starting to get a little weird. Yeah, anything past three seconds is a little stalkerish. Delinquents! Hey. 16 years ago, a baby boy was born. And he was born to a mother who was a rolling stone without the talent to back up her heathen-like behaviors. Truth is, she refused to stick around all those years ago and perform her duty as a parent. She pops in every once in a while to get her updates, but she's no mom. It tore up her heart when she found out that the boy's foster father ended up being a piece of shit and hit the road. A story I'm sure a few of you can relate to. Luckily for the boy, he has no idea of his parental arrangements. Now this boy, he was forced to run a marathon because of the greed and the selfish desires of the adults around him. Those adults were so drunken with illusions of grandeur, or what you kids would say, being a boss, they didn't stop to even think of the fact that they were making this boy run a race with two broken legs. At times, he walked, limped, and even crawled to the finish line. Without enough water to even keep him hydrated. Now I'm sure a few of you are probably rooting for this boy. You want to know if he won the race or if he even finished. But my question to you is, if you were thrown into the same fire, what would you do? Would you quit, finish, or win? Now I have watched you shitheads cuss each other out, even draw blood from one another. And I swear to God if your arms was long enough, you might have reached out and smacked each other's mommas a couple times. Five years from now, when you find yourself feeling a little bit down because life is hard and you're wondering what is the point of your journey and everything that you've gone through, just focus on the finish line. And remember the boy. It's final speech time. Garrett? I'm not exactly sure what I've learned here. To be honest, Saturday School sucks for every kid in America. I never took that purse, but here I am. So if I have to say anything, it's watch the company you keep. I don't like liars. I can do without instigators. And I don't like cheese. What? Oh, like cheese doesn't put dimples on the back of your thighs? It's my fault you're all here. I've been standing by watching students get bullied and ignored for being themselves for so long, that when I saw Kyler and Garrett give TJ such a hard time, I couldn't take it anymore. And I guess it didn't help that I caught you two in such a flirtatious mood that day. The last thing an angry girl wants is to be hit on by someone who doesn't take the moment to say hello. But that's still no excuse for me punishing you. I stole the purse. As much as we can blame Sky for stealing and not speaking up for us, we could blame me as well for keeping her secret. But honestly, I'm glad it happened. I haven't had this much fun or felt this accepted in my entire life. And I've learned that in order to be accepted, not only do you have to be open about who you are, but you have to be prepared to accept whatever comes with that. And I accept you guys. I don't know everything, but I'm working my ass off to learn whatever I can. And if Sky's right about anything, it's that the bullying needs to stop. Whether it's sexuality, weight, or money, we all have our differences. Besides, what would I look like if I expected everybody to look half as good as me? I am curious about one thing though. Sky, what'd you spend that money on? Haters are everywhere and they're gonna hate. So long as I remember that, I'm sure I'll be just fine. I know it doesn't fix what I did, but TJ, everyone, I never spent the cash. I hope we've all learned to believe in second chances. Because I know I need one. A few months ago, if this were a cliff, I'd probably have written you a thank you card if you had pushed me off the ledge. I wasn't a happy person, and I was even less thrilled to be here with all of you every Saturday. But I'm not sure, without this place, I'm not sure I would have even wanted to graduate from high school. And I definitely wouldn't have had as many real friends as I do now. I haven't always shown my best that I care about much in life. But you guys have given me a heartbeat. Now I know I'm going to graduate from high school and I'm gonna do great things. It's not only because I care, it's because I'm surrounded by so many people that are gonna push me to do so. Ms. Michaels, you said life was hard. But I only tend to believe it's hard if you don't have meaningful people in your life to care for. And that's the biggest lesson that I've learned in this paradise of yours. Do you like it? I made it myself. I put a little jalapenos in the sauce to give it a little extra oomph, if you know what I'm saying. You need a little extra time in the bedroom, boy. But in the meantime, it'll put some hair on your chest. One thing Ms. Michaels did right. Really. Wonder if there's more. Well, guess I'll leave you guys to it. Thanks, Scar. It doesn't take a rocket doctor to know when the you had me at hello moment is coming. So is she right? Well, I don't hear any theme music. I guess that answers several of my questions then. Which were what, exactly? Well, I was sort of wondering if that was our first fight or our final goodbye? Really? If that's how you are during your first fight, who would ever be interested in a round two? Okay. Final goodbye it is then. Sky. What? Tie game. You cheat! These are your rules, woman. I don't know why you turned your back on me. You know I'm always interested in round two of a good scrap. All right, easy there, rockstar. What? Well, you hear that? What? Think that's your heart pounding or that's our theme music. Those two should get a room. Or someone. Scarlett, I've never been on a date before. Do you think you might wanna go out some time? My treat. It'd be a first for both of us. Don't think I've ever seen you so happy, Ms. Michaels. Y'all have come a long way. Especially that one. He finally spoke his truth. Got a little bass in his voice. Yeah, but what about you? Oh, son, my voice stopped dropping many moons ago. Unlike some other things, if you catch my drift. Yeah, yeah, I do.
