Just spilled my drink. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay, I'm ready. You know what night tonight is. My god! I got the perfect outfit for us to wear. Uh-oh, uh-oh. Cheers. Come on, mom, hurry. Okay, I'm coming. We are criticizing you. Stop crying, be a mom, and leave. Oh, what happened to my voice? I can't believe it. This might be a beautiful place for a wedding. Hint, hint. Sounds like miguels' not ready to get married. Is three and a half years really enough time to get to know somebody? - Yes. - Yes. Where the hell is the button? - What is that? - That's a vibrator. - Are you kidding? - And I'll show you how to turn it on. I know how to turn on. I have one. I don't use a vibrator. What do you use? Daddy. Ew! Oh, my god! - Oh, sunhe's praying. - She's praying. God, please wake my daughter up. Mama knows best, and she wants the best for you. captions paid for by discovery communications Cheers! Cheers. Oh, boy, I'm excited to see dawn and cher. I don't know if I want to hear them so much, but... ...I do want to see what happened. Are you ready? It's coming on. Are you ready? All right, mom, hurry up. Ooh, I'm excited. Mm-hmm. Let's get this going. Mwah! Let's do this. Okay. Oh, here, give me this. It's all mine. You can't have it. We got to share. No. Come on. For the baby. Brittani and I, we've always lived together. And plus I'm only 19. I haven't moved away. If that was the case, she would probably die from separation anxiety. Like us. Yeah. That's a little much. Aw! Aw! The best way to start our day is in the shower. But why together? Yeah, start the day with a shower, but not together. Why are they... ew! She's washing her back? You want me to wash your back? No, thank you. When my mom does simple things like washing my hair or washing my body, it makes me feel comforted. I mean, that would be nice, actually. I like my head rubbed. I love her, and I don't see anything wrong with it. I love you with all my heart, but I don't want to see you naked. I don't want to see that down there. Hey! It's old. Hey! These are old. Hey! At least they're not fake. I'm just a doty mom. I don't think "doty" is the right word for this one. We used to. But not anymore. We're more bath people now. You know, we love the bubbles, you know? Mornings with my mom are so important because we work so much. Hey, angelica. Yeah, mom? Are you ready to get in? I'll be right there. She's not getting in, is she? If the water is still hot, we will share the bath water, but they get out separately, right? She always goes first. Why are they sharing bath water? They want each others germs? We share shower water, but we don't share bath water. I know. Okay, so I consider myself a little bit cleaner. But how old is angelica? Too damn old to be doing this. I think the shower is a little healthier, but I still don't think it's a good idea. No. No. Vegas! This is my princess's... She's more excited than me. ...21st birthday. I want to go back. You ready for your surprise? What surprise? I'm scared, dude. Remember how you've been wanting your lip injections? No. - Wait, what? - What? That's not a great surprise for a 21-year-old. That could be a new rap song. Hi. How are you? I am the greatest mother. No. Really. I thought I was the greatest mother when, you know, I made you soup when you were sick. - Right. - I think this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my entire life. She's gorgeous. Why would you even, like, change your face? Her friend is like, "who are these people, and why are they friends with you?" oh, here we go. - Hi! - Welcome. He looks like dracula. I'm come to make up... I've come to fetch you. I wouldn't go near a doctor like that. I want to look just like my daughter. You're going to need a lot more to get your lips done to look like your daughter. We're going out tonight. So they're going to all look like... No, they're not going to look... - We're not. - You're not even going to be able to drink tonight. Your face is gonna be numb. - How do you know that? - You're gonna be like... Jen, come on. I think jen needs to, like, go outside or something. Who's goes out the night they get their lips done? What if you have a bad reaction? And what doctor stands there and argues with somebody? They will be drinking as much as they want. They can eat whatever they want. That doctor had our back. That doctor had our back. He was ready to fight her. He was. As a cosmetic nurse, you definitely do not do it before going out. And also, you're not supposed to drink the same night because it can cause more bruising. You're going to feel this going in, okay? Oh! That looks painful. I hate needles. Any kind of needles that hurts so much. Oh. Mom, shush. - Why? - Because you're making me hurt. Relax. It's just going to be pumped up a little bit. That's it's, okay? I can punch you in the mouth, and then that would do the same thing, wouldn't it? Ha! She's funny. This friend is not having it. Happy birthday. - She's so beautiful. - Tell me when it's over. Oh. Oh She literally looks like she got stung by a bee. - It's a little extra. - She's got the duck look. It's a little swollen, so... It's super full, and I cannot even talk. - Whoo! - Getting vegas started! Whoo! Yeah! It was an exciting experience to be able to do this with my daughter. And just think what you're going to have to spend in lipstick. I'm marcia, I'm 68 years young, and I'm alena's mom. My relationship with her is unique. Hey, poppy. Oh! Is she licking her? Yeah. Oh, my god. In the mornings, like, walk in her room, and I just lick her all up. She's licking her. Well... You don't lick your kid. Okay, I do that to your kids. They're 5. I'm alena. I'm 21 years old. I love it when my mama licks me. It kind of makes me feel closer to her because we're doing something funny and out of the ordinary. I feel like that's how you are with the dogs. I couldn't get a puppy, so I turned into the doggy. I hope she got fresh breath. Oh, stop it. Stop it! Let's go. We got to go. I'm going to get you. They're having fun! You gonna get me? The only time you chase me around... I still chase you around. Is when I came home drunk or late. Well, okay, so we can't judge. It's a thing we do every day. Why don't you play like that with me? No. Some people don't agree. That is so weird. When I catch my mama, and I do all my kissy-poos, and I kiss her all up. Give me a kissy poo. Come on, give me kissy poo. Get the hell out of here. No kissy poos for you. - She's very kissable. - Oh, thank you. You're very kissable, too. - Yeah. - They're sweet, but I just don't go for this. It's not offensive. It's kind of cute. Okay, mom. I could actually play a song I wrote, go, girl! Yeah! Music video. Wow, she wrote that? She's very talented. Very. You go, girl. She's good! She has a great voice. She's so good! I'm going to download your song. I'm trying. I'm really excited to see my mom. I'm also feeling a little guilty because I've been keeping my pregnancy a secret for the past seven weeks. Seven weeks? No, I couldn't keep that a secret from you. I was going to say you better not. I would tell you before I would tell my man. Yes. For sure. When you found out that you were expecting, I was the very first person that knew. Mm-hmm. So she says she's close to her mother, but she wants to keep it from her mother. It don't make no sense. I'm surprised she kept it this long. I cannot believe it. - I got you a little something. - Are you kidding? You don't have to get... Just you being here. I love surprises. "only the best moms get promoted to mimi." what's a mimi? A grandma. Oh. She's going to say this. "oh, my god!" I'm gonna be a grandma! A mimi! Are you pregnant? Are you pregnant?! Hold on. This is gonna get loud. Oh, my god! What happened to my voice? I didn't know you could go that high. Me neither. I went into a different mode. They had to have subtitles. Geez. Oh, my god, she's so happy. Look, this is where she... I know, this is where we found out that we were having you. Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, no, the stick she pee-peed on. I love it. I'm gonna keep it forever. Oh! Oh, did she just kiss it? She sure did. Bro! On someone's urine stick, okay? It's inside. It's not on the outside. But you still peed on the outside. I would to the same thing probably. I know you would. I peed on that, mom. It doesn't matter! Jared, like, wouldn't even touch that stick. Smart jared. Thumbs up for jared. To me, it was such a lucky piece, because actually that was the one that said it was positive. But still kind of gross, but I get it. No, it's not. I feel like it's me having the baby, too. I'm so excited. If he did all this to impress me, it didn't work. - No go. - Not impressed. What?! What do you want? Impressed me. What are we... What are we doing? Well, you're going to watch some clips with me. With you? With me. One and only. Oh, boy. You can handle it. My mom does what she wants to do, and if it means dropping in on carlo at the gym to convince carlo to move into her house because of the construction on the house, she'll do it. What are you wearing? Richard simmons just called. He wants his workout outfit back. I think she's in the wrong century. He said, "can you tell your mom that I need my outfit back?" I'm either richard simmons, I'm gene simmons. I'm just going to change my name to kathy simmons. You really are. I don't want to look stupid. You don't want to look stupid? No! Ma, you are killing me. You look like you're doing, like, a video from 1982. She's in a jazzercise program. And one and two and three and one. You're like a jazzercise. And go, and go. It's like that kind of video. Don't, like, walk in, like, "carlo, cristina said..." like, I don't think you should walk in like that. First they hit the pizza place. Now they're going to the gym. Is no place sacred for this guy? I have a lot in common with kathy. Apparently. Maybe I should have been italian. Uh-huh. Here we go again. Do you see how many times we do this? There's definitely a pattern. We need to stop doing this. We need to find a new way to discuss issues with carlo. - Hi. - What are you doing here? Oh, this is so awkward. That's his shrine. Don't interrupt him. What are you wearing, first of all? Ah! The outfit. I think you guys should move into my house for the first remodeling. There's no way I'm moving in with her mother. I don't even know why they're interrupting my workout. It's I've made my decision, and that's it. No. I'll figure things out like that. Who are you just to make up your decision? Who is this guy? I'm not staying at your house for that long. I kind of get his argument. He wants his own space. We would save a lot of money. I just think it's better than us actually going to rent a place. I've known carlo for a couple of years now. Who asked for her opinion? I love kimmy. She's a sweetheart. She has a better body than him from what I'm seeing. You could use some muscles. I'm more tone than muscle. You could get rid of your stomach and your chin. I can always work on some stuff. We all can. Why don't we try it? I'm not doing it. She's not going to leave me alone until you give her an answer. I'm doing this right now. You should have told her no. How do you stop her? What am I going to do? Stop. Tie her down? - He knows she's unstoppable. - That's not gonna work. - Go. - Go where? Go, bye. He's kind of firm. I like that about him. How would you act towards me if I was like, "stop, get out, no." oh, I would still win. - Goodbye. - And I'm not doing it. So goodbye. - Yes, you are. He's not going to go. Pack up, baby. It's not happening. Sorry. I'm still the king. Prince. King. Prince. King. I like him. He's my idol. My mom wants to use tonight's date night with miguel to pressure him into proposing. What is wrong with them? Miguel! What's up, guys? Honey! I mean, it's a good thing that the mom likes him. We know what it's like when you don't like somebody. Who are you trying to say? Sarah likes to invite her mother on date nights, you know, and I prefer for me and sarah to have our own nights. I hope she's not going on every date. I think they maybe need a little bit of private time, you know, without her mom there. Laurie and sarah have a very special relationship in the form of it's sometimes uncomfortably too close. Being in a strong relationship with your mother should be normal. Now they think that it's abnormal to be close to your mother. And I just think, you know, sometimes where's my attention? He knows what he's getting into. It's always "me, me, me." jason's not like that. No, he just... Procrastinates too much. This might be a beautiful place for a wedding. Hint, hint. If it flows that way. - It's flowing, miguel. - Oh, yeah? Oh, boy. Sounds like miguel's not ready to get married. Miguel's having his cake and eating it, too. Is three and a half years really enough time to get to know somebody? - Yeah. - Yes, it is. Sarah, honey, you know I love miguel, but we're going to go move on. Ooh. Yes! Mama knows best, and she wants the best for you. I thought me and sarah were exclusive. You know she's part of the package. Look at her face. She means business. Why does he want to wait 5 to 10 years? Yeah, there's no point. And I feel like it is the right thing to have a wedding that my mom can take part in. She's afraid her mom might, god forbid, die and not be able to be there for the wedding. That's why she's pushing it. Yeah. After three years, if he can't make no guarantees... Hey, the food is here. Came at the right time, my man. He's avoiding the question. I don't like his attitude at all. I don't think miguel fully understands the depth of my health and all the issues surrounding it. It's hard. You don't want to give him an ultimatum either. It's a tough position. I'm looking at dialysis any day. I'm holding on. Oh, my god, we don't want to hear about this on a date. I need a transplant right now. She needs a kidney. I'll give her one. That's sweet. You're not going to move me, sway me, or push me. This boulder will go downhill when it's ready. Do it on my time when I dump your ass! I don't need a piece of paper to tell me that we're eternally bound to each other. Bye-bye, felicia. You don't have my vote. Thumbs down. She's going to end up either cheating on him or leaving him because she's going to get fed up with this type of personality. Miguel's number one priority is miguel. Duh! He can have his reasons why he's waiting, but he has to understand I have my reasons. - Right. - Yeah. Or get off the pot. Yeah. Miguel, grow up. Aw, they're snuggling. I had trouble sleeping, my mother and I share the same bed. I'm the little spoon, and she's the big spoon. It's okay that they cuddle, though. No, they share the bed every night. We sleep together sometimes. We do, too. It's not a big deal. If I could find a man that was like you, I'd marry in a heartbeat. She wants a man that's like her daughter. It's a little weird. Just a bit. That'd be like paradise. Yep. Paradise. They need to just get married already. We still need that bonding time together, just her and I alone. You live together, though. I'm not going to be laying up with you while your man's sleeping by himself. I'd be like, "go get your man." if I had a choice, I would always stay with you. When angelica and I are close... A little too close, ...I can't imagine her feeling like that with anyone else, especially jason. Well, I get that. Not with jason. The way that angelica looks at her mom is like she infatuated. With brett, it just is. He loves you. I can see it every time he looks at you. He's a great man. Then don't lose your man if he's a great man. Where is your man? - She likes brett from afar. - Right. She likes brett to maybe see every few weeks, you know? Right. If he lived there... I'm not sure she would like brett as much. My dream is for angelica to realize that jason isn't the man for her. Now it's at a controlling level for a parent to be like that. That mother is not going to let that daughter have happiness. Absolutely not. All fours is another really good position. Ahhhh. Oh, my god. That's how you get pregnant. That's how you get pregnant. Where are we headed to? We're going to go to this, like, chippendale's type black magic show. It was my mom's idea. I was so embarrassed. Look at my lips. We are in vegas for my 21st birthday, and I'm celebrating with my friends and of course, my mom. If I'm mariah's friend and you tell me that your mom is going to come to our vegas weekend, I'm going to be like... I don't think so..."what?" now we're going to the black magic live show, which is an all male strip show. I think the mom wants this party for herself, not for her daughter. Black magic time. Well, at least if she falls in the pool, she won't drown. She'll have her lips to keep her afloat. Her lips look like they got stuck in a vacuum cleaner. They're taking over her face. I would probably go to a club. I would take you to a club, but I'm not interested in male strippers. Women have prettier bodies. That's true. I felt like it was a little bit weird with mariah's mom there. I would never do this with my mom. I mean, I don't think that's crazy, to go to a strip club with your mom. It looks kind of fun. It does look like fun. That's a cute outfit you had on. Damn! That was poppin'. Mama was poppin'. Droppin'. Mom's up to something. You've got to make it special. Okay. Okay. She's wearing long johns to the club. Maybe she's got bad circulation. She needs to stay warm. Mom, you didn't tell them to do anything for my birthday, did you? No. I love that she likes to feel young and act young and be with her daughter. I get it. I feel the same way. But she's trying too hard to fit in. You didn't tell them? No, no. Are you ready for some chocolate? Oh, my gosh. Oh, hell... All right. I would have rather just went to a regular club. You know what? I'm glad mariah at least doesn't like... she realizes this is disgusting. Oh, mom's getting excited now. Who is tonight about, mariah or sandra? These poor girls must be so embarrassed they don't know what to do. How many ladies who are celebrating a birthday? Oh, no. - Mariah. - Whoo! Yes. I did not want to go up there, dude. I'm going to have you come up for a second. Okay, come on. - What's going on?! We went to a male strip club at my bachelorette party. It was so much fun! It was so fun. We went to thunder from down under. I recommend that. First thing we're gonna do is, we're gonna crown the queen. Sandra's having more fun that mariah. She is. That's why it's so funny. Aaaah! I would love to be mariah right now. We know! Why did you feel it was okay to have them pull me up on stage, even though you knew I told you not to do that? It's your 21st birthday. You're supposed to have a wiener rubbed in your face. It's your 21st birthday. Come on, everybody does it. It happened. What do you want me to do? Nothing. I just don't even want to talk to you anymore. Okay, good. Bye. Bye. My mom ruined my 21st birthday. Ungrateful. Mm-hmm. She was just trying to have a good time with her daughter. Oh, I have a surprise for you. Oh, my gosh. What is this? I want you to try the lamaze class. Oh, my gosh. Go to a lamaze class without jared? Jared and I already talked about this. There's no reason... Well, just try it. Yeah, it just so happened that you did this completely behind my back, too. I wasn't planning to. I just wanted try one class, and then if she likes it, she would discuss it with you. It's just a coincidence that I was at work the whole time. It was a surprise! I hope she tries very hard to go natural, like I did, to be like me! That's kind of selfish. That's because they didn't have the drugs then. I'm pretty sure that jared would be annoyed if he found out that my mom and I were taking this lamaze class together. Eh... I think, you know, her mom is just trying to give her more options. They're going to assume that she's single. Is the father coming to the birth, as well? That's a couple right there. You see that? I know, but it's just to get information on it. One of the great parts of childbirth class is the bonding experience of connecting with your partner in preparation. That's how you got pregnant in the first place, you connected. The last thing I wanted was a connection at that moment. Hold hands and look at each other in the eyes. Just gaze. There's no gazing when you're in pain. That's a little weird. I love you, but I don't think I could stare in your eyes like that. Mom, you stare at my eyes in a weird way in general. I can't even look at you for a long time. Really? Cher's like, "help me." the mom loves her so much. She really does. I feel like the other couple is staring at us. They are. Can you see those judgy eyes? It's a little awkward. Really a lot of rocking and rolling. Or like I said, I mean, really... Ahhh. Oh, my god. I'd be running out the door if somebody told me to do that to give birth. I've never had to do any of that for lamaze. That's strange. How things have changed. I've never been to a lamaze class, so this is quite interesting for me. And let's just rock back and forth. So I'm just curious what her husband thinks about the mom doing the class. Are we not supposed to support each other as mother and daughter? I mean, I would get it if jared wasn't around. That's another story altogether. - Yeah. - All fours is another really good position, if you guys want to try. All fours is another good position. Yeah, it is. That's how you get pregnant. That's how you get pregnant. We do everything else the same. We should deliver babies the same, too! Maybe the mom should get pregnant right now. They could have a baby around the same time. When jared finds out that my mom took me to a lamaze class, he's going to be disappointed that he wasn't involved. Do you blame him? No, you can't blame him. He didn't miss nothing, girl. Don't even worry about it. Oh, my gosh. What in the world was that that we just watched? I don't know. Give it back. Give it back. Give it back. Oh, my god. I feel angry. This is not right. I just had to get my coffee. Okay. What moment is this going to be? I did it again. I'm having bad luck. Don't do it like that. I just got a shell. They look so much alike. - Yeah. - I can't believe she's adopted. I don't believe it. Even as a baby, they look alike. - I like when you cook. - Yeah, I know you do. It's very nice. I like when somebody cooks, too. Alena thinks that I'm the chef and she's visiting the restaurant. Oh, she's royalty. Whoa. That was not a good idea. - Oh, my gosh. - She didn't know the fire was gonna be that big. It's like pssh! That's us with the tortillas. Here, go ahead. Do your thing. Move this way. My hair! My face! My eyebrows. Geez. She's 21, but part of me wants to keep her close forever. Here comes the airplane. Oh, no, no, no. Don't go there. Whee! Don't miss my mouth. Whee! Whee! Oh, you have got... Oh, that's a bit much. Okay, this is overkill now. I get the bond, the relationship, but that's a little much. She's like treating her almost like she's still a kid. And alena's kind of like enjoying the fact that she's just like doesn't have to grow up, but she's 21. Like, she's got to grow up at some point. Whoa! There you go. It landed. Mmm! That's how I'm gonna feed you tonight. I'll just spit it right back in your face. That's how I'm gonna feed you tonight. Where's your bag that you're taking? It should be by the door. Tonight, cher went into labor, and the best part is a few weeks ago, cher finally saw it my way and is willing to try a natural birth just like I did. Yeah, we'll see. Cher is in labor for just two hours now. The contractions are only 15 minutes apart. Oh, I hate those labor pains. I can still feel it. That's nothing. She's got a long way to go, girl. 15 minutes apart. That's not even pain yet. In five minutes, she's gonna be swearing at her mother saying, "you wanted me to feel this?!" I'm going to stay right by cher's side through this whole process, even in the delivery room. I think she wants to deliver the baby herself. Cher's labor is starting to get really intense, and I feel like it's time to go to the hospital right away. I'd be going to the hospital. I think it's time to go to the hospital. Hello. We're planning on walking to the hospital. Walking? They have to be kidding. If we don't go soon, we might not make it in time. That's what dawn did. You know, I was born in a taxi cab because my father did the same thing to my mother. Unbelievable. Calm down. I am calm. You're worried. Oh, mimi. That's really sweet. She's there with mama. She's calming her mom. Yeah, it's supposed to be the other way around. Well, her mom's been doing everything, though. Let's go. Time to go. - Got shoes? - Yeah. Let's go. They're all carrying, like, luggage. Are they going on a camping trip? Or are they going to deliver a baby? What is going on? I'm pretty sure the father's got a tent. They've got more duffel bags and stuff. Where are they going to have this baby? Out in the wilderness or something? I can not believe they're walking to the hospital. Can you? No, I don't... I don't know. That's crazy. Contractions are getting closer, and I'm getting really worried because I gave birth in the car and I don't want her to give birth in new york city on the sidewalk. Good idea, mom. Oh, my god. Do you think she's going to have the baby in the street or what? I hope not. Yo, girl, coming through. He should have been more assertive and said, like, I understand that you want to have this time with your daughter, but medically, we need to get the out of here and go to the hospital. - Hello. - Hi. How are you? How can I help you guys? I made an appointment for us to get bikini waxes. You come with me to my bikini waxes. Yeah, you come with me, too. We're just getting our patches waxed. Oh, god. It's called a sugar cookie. Why do they call it brazilian? Do brazilian people not have any hair? - I don't know. - I don't know why they call it a brazilian. It should be called, like, bald eagle or something. Bald eagle? I really don't have a lot of hair. I didn't inherit that from you, so I have to go get my brazilian waxes. - I have a weird question. - Yeah. Maybe, I don't know. I want to know if we could get it done together. You know, like, a couples massage where people get it done together. A couple? If you guys are both comfortable with it, I guess you both can go in the room together if you'd like. I sit down or lay down? Yeah, lay down. Oh, my god. Her underwear matches her shirt. - This is so weird. - Can you move left like this? Oh, cristina, I want to murder you. You'll be fine. At least they're not naked, you know? It's not bad at all. - Ooh! - Oh! It hurts! Aaaah! I can't even imagine feeling that. The lip wax is bad enough. I've never had anything waxed. Not even my eyebrows. Oh, some of us are perfect. Ouch. I'm like dying watching this because it hurts so bad. Oh, my gosh. It's a little much. I mean, it's right in her lucky spot. Oh, my god. I'm so scared. We're going to talk. Oh! Thank god I don't have to do it. It's so nice. It's nice to be asian with no hair. Holy don't swear. - It hurts! - What's the matter with you? See, now, that's a real reaction. You have to have the permanent hair removal, ladies. I wouldn't do no waxes, though. That freakin' hurts. I just want to do permanent hair removal all from my body so I'm like hairless. What?! I want to be completely hairless, okay? Oh, my god. Okay, you do what you got to do. I'll do what I got to do. What? I see you shave your legs. Listen, I'm talking runway. Nice runway. - Can I clean it? - Sure. Clean it all up. Clean it. Do whatever you want to it. Slap it around. It's a vibrator. And I'll show you how to turn it on. I know how to turn it on. I have one. If you have a vibrator, don't even tell me. I don't want to know. You should explore it and make sure you know where everything is and how it works. Oh, I know where everything was. Well, then that's good. I hope you know where everything is. Want to see the new one that I just bought? You are gonna freakin' love this one. This is a vibrator. A what? Is that a microphone? What is that? That's a vibrator. Are you kidding? I'll show you how to turn it on. I know how to turn it on. I have one. If you have a vibrator, don't even tell me. I don't want to know. We'll leave it at that. I don't use a vibrator. What do you use? Daddy. Ew! I don't want to think about that. Where the hell is the button? Oh, I heard the click. Why is it not working? I couldn't have worn it out. What I always told you was, it's your body, you own it. You should explore it and make sure you know where everything is and how it works. Oh, I know where everything is. Well, then that's good. I hope you know everything is. Yes. Don't ask me any questions. Do you own it? No. - Are you ready for this? - Where are these two off to? - Uh-oh. - I can... look at this. I know. There goes the tension. I think angelica is preparing herself mentally and physically to break things off with jason. I would never take you to go break up with someone. I really thought jason would finalize his divorce, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen. Stop playing. He's not wearing no damn suit. - Come on in - oh, I'm, like, cringing. I was like, "what the hell? He's in a damn suit." I was thinking that, too. I was like, "why is he in a suit?" I have something I'd like to show you. Come with me. It's like a roller coaster. You ready? Watch your step. - Oh, no. - Oh. Oh, no. What is this? Come with me. Oh, look how pretty. No, it was pretty. I thought it was going to be like he was going to give me papers for the divorce. That's what I thought. Yeah, that's what I thought, too. That's what I was hoping for. Yeah. Why is her mom there? Mom, leave. Sunhe, leave. You know that I promised to take care of my baggage, right? Mm-hmm. Well... Oh, my god! He's married. What's he going to do? Would you accept my love? To take things the next step? What kind of question is that? You've already accepted his love, so why was he even questioning that? I thought that was really weird of jason. He's weird in general. She's not answering. Because the mom is going to rip her eyes out. This feels very strange to me. You think? Don't you dare ruin this. Uh... I promise. Don't look at your mother. You think that ring is even real? I mean, look at it. Aw! She deserves it. Yay! Whoo! Sunhe is not having it. Aw, sunhe's praying. She's praying. God, please wake my daughter up! Sunhe, I have something for you, as well. It's a key to my house. That's freaking weird. This man crazy. I would like you to move in with me, as well, if you would accept. I was in shock. Yeah. Of course. Nobody gives their house key to a mom. When they're not even married. But I'm not just a mom. My point is... Would you allow him to just put me out on the street? To not take me with you? No. That would never have been an option. I hope not. I can't accept this from you. If he did all this to impress me, it didn't work. No go. Not impressed. What?! What do you want? Impressed me. In fact, I was disgusted. I don't think she even should accept your ring. Girl, don't give it back, what it looks like to me is an engagement ring. It's not an engagement ring. I wanted to punch him in the throat. The ring that I gave angelica is not an engagement ring. Obviously. Because I can't ask her to marry me right now. It offends me that he would even do this. It's a joke. This is not turning out how I expected it to. This guy's delusional. Sunhe is ruining our special moment. Why he want to play the victim? Don't play the victim. You are a grown ass man. You're a married man. Take care. Handle your business. Don't let all this make your decision. He's still married. Give it back. Give it back. Give it back. Oh, my god. I feel angry. This is not right. I couldn't celebrate with you. I'm like, "I want to kill him." she gave it back. She did. Oh, my god. I can't. I want to throw up. Really? I feel like she's only thinking about herself, and it hurts me. Oh, this poor girl. She's heartbroken. That is so stupid. I have to look out for my baby. She's selfish. You don't love her enough. Get a divorce, buddy. Absolutely. So... Next time on "smother knows best"... We're going to be getting colon cleanses. Oh, it hurts! Pressure! Pressure. Oh - this looks like underclothes. - Are those clean? - Yes. - He's like, "no, I sniffed them last night." he's clearly holding on to something, girl. I have saved all of sarah's baby teeth. They sit in a drawer right next to my bed. I can understand that. What the I don't think I'd sniff your baby teeth, though. Please don't. Alright, let me just... Why's the mom wearing that hat? You should talk. Ms. Pinata sweater. Okay, fine. I'll shut up. I never even thought of mom and daughter would want to do a sexy photo shoot together. It's slightly weird. - Slightly? - Slightly? She has no boundaries at all with her. I don't even know why you're involved in this whole situation. I'm involved, baby. I'm involved. "I'm involved, baby! I'm involved!"
