(dramatic music) (ominous music) (crowd applauds) - And do we have a peach of a day or not? You know, it's my goal to get more jobs to the people of this city than ever before. Well, we have here the executive of Freedom Foods, and we have them to thank for it, so let's give them a big round of applause. (crowd applauds) - [Crowd] USA, USA, USA, USA! (playful music) (munching) (screaming) (snoring) - [Man] Oh God, it's got teeth. Oh my God, let me through. (screams) - I forgot how to get... - Better run, everybody. You can't stay, you can't stay. One pass and I'm done. I can't see. - I can you. You're ascared of me. (growling) (gun fires) - Oh, hello, Principal Johnson. You just missed movie time. (bell rings) Oh. (kids cheering) Alright, kids. Have a great weekend. I'll see you next week; one more week of fifth grade. Try not to act, uh, too upset. - I just had to see for myself. Congratulations, Sam? This isn't exactly school curriculum. - It's the second to last Friday of the school year. I just thought I'd reward them with something a little more fun. - What's Sam deserve congratulating for? - He finally got one of his films into a big film festival. - Oh! Did he? Oh, was it, Zombie Space Vikings? Zombie Prom Night? - There's something wrong with my face! (screaming) - Shirley no! - Or was it, uh, something with babies? - Zombie Abortion Apocalypse. - Zembryos attack! Sweet revenge, sweet revenge! - Oh, oh, yeah that one, yeah. - You have to admire his persistence. - Dear, persistence can be a sign of insanity. - Hyyy-ya! - Easy. - That, boys and girls, is our classic ninja zombie kill move. Well that's it for class today. Parents, you should be proud of these little ninjas. - And remember, next Tuesday is our home invasion defense workshop. - Yes parents, it's good practice for those of you who do not want your kids kidnapped, or raped, or raped by kidnappers. - Kidnapping can really stunt a child's development. - Hell yeah. * I can't buy you dinner - [Man] Popper, Popper! - Hey, what the shit? I'll just, I'll just stay down here. - [Woman] You're gonna want to get up for this. - Oh, I'm up. - What can I help you with? - Steve Popolopsis? - My friends call me Popper. What do they call you, baby? Hot Pink? - Oh you can call me whatever you like, Popper, but you've been served. - Oh, shit. - Been served what? A sexy-gram? Fuckin' bitch. - I get that a bunch. You have a nice day, Mr. Popper. - Popper don't preach, bro, she done filed for D. (laughing) - Shut up. Shut up! - [Felecia] Mr. Pentergass, we thank you for your short film submission, Deadbeat Zombie Dad, to the 2016 horror film fest. We are sorry to inform you Deadbeat Zombie Dad did not make our final lineup in the festival. The truth is your movie is a steaming pile of shitnuggets, with the production value of a home video shot by a deaf, blind amputee that is drunk on cheap gin. Please consider quitting filmmaking altogether, maybe concentrating on digging ditches full time. Hopefully you'll perish in a fire or contract genital herpes. Warm regards, festival director Felecia Fugate. - Sweetie, how's my little Scorsese? - Uh, yeah, mom, just a second. - Sweetheart, I want that letter to put in your book. - This is not a good time, alright? - Honey, all your friends are here already. You've gotta come out. Now get your tail out here, you're being rude! (upbeat music) - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, congratulations. - Yeah, thanks for coming. - Course. - Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. - Hey, Horatio. - Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam! Well, I guess a congratulations is in order. - Thank you. - Sam, Sam. It is not that I don't... - 'Scuse me, bro. - Hey, man. - Guys look! Stoner cam! - Hey that's awesome, man. That's really cool. - It's great, it really was, It's not that I don't like Zombie Dad, it's just that it is lacking something. It's just, it's lacking something. How would one say? It is... It is complete shit, Sam. It is complete and utter shit. Because you casted amateurs, Sam. Amateurs. - Oh, yeah. - And I know that Ocean Spray has his Megacuts commercial, I know that. I know that but I... - Yeah it's a good commercial. - It's a pretty good commercial, I will say that. But everybody else, Sam... - I'll be thinking about you when I drop this deuce. I've got a turtlehead saying let me out, let me out. Move, bitch. - No, Tibo, I actually really... - That was lovely, Tibo, thank you. - M-hmm. - It is a wonder, Mr. Pentergass... - Yes. - If you're even talented at all. - Great. Thank you so much, Horatio. Do you mind if I just kinda have my party? - I'm leaving now, Sam. - Okay. Thanks, thanks for coming. Awesome, Sam. How you gonna get out of this one? It's not like you can say, whoops, sorry, I didn't actually read the letter. (upbeat music) - You're like a legit filmmaker now, bro! We should team up, you know, make a movie, like, what if like two guys travel across the country on their motorcycles in search of America? - Yeah, man, um... I think that's already might've already kinda been done, but we can do something else... - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Alright, I got another one. I got another one. - Okay, alright, yeah. - Two guys. - Okay. - Wake up in the morning, and their car is gone. - Yeah. Yup. - What was up with that cheer uniform today?

Peter Anthony! - So your little runt did it, huh? - Yes he did. And he's gotta go say something. He can't just like, sit there. You gotta go get him to make a speech. - I think this could be a good thing because he is such a good public speaker. - Honey, please!

And then there's Janice, bitch is divorcing me, so I hope she gets genital herpes and poison ivy on her nipples in the same afternoon. Fuck it, I'm getting wrecked! You're a fuckin' mad man lying about getting into the festival. - Wait, what? - Yeah, you said we were going to get an apartment in L.A., asshole. - Yeah, I was totally gonna get laid by a girl. - And I think you should be with me at the premiere and that's, it's gonna be good for everybody.

I mean, the head smash in this last one was the best one ever. - Can you not hit so many bumps, Tibo? I know I'm five minutes younger than you but shit, learn to drive, man. - Look man, that's what you get for polluting your body. I told you before, your body is your temple. You should be ashamed of yourself. - Oh my gosh, are you really bringing that up right now? The person who jerks off to pregnancy videos? Yeah, tell 'em, Tibo. Tell everybody Tibo your darkness, your dark secrets of the of the mom's birthing and the babies coming out of the vagina. And he jerks off to that. Argh, I need to stop. - Dude, what? - Listen, they're not pregnancy videos, they're birthing videos. Pregnancy videos are nasty. Birthing videos are sexy and they're art. - Whatever, your temple's just wrong. - Dude. - I haven't even tried that. - Oh it's good, you should try it, man. - Okay, okay, it gets kind of hot, but it shouldn't be hot. - See, when you see those thighs open wide and that water break and, and she's wet, yo. - Ah!

I mean, I'm gonna need therapy after that, or a birthing video. - Guys can we please just go? It's like a dutch oven in here. - You know what, there hasn't been a brother like that in the state since, and he gave him the ol' dipsy-do. - [Waitress] Hi, what can I get for you? - Just a root beer float. - [Waitress] You got it. - Hey, you're Pistol Love's nephew aren't you? - Yeah. - Man, we were just talking about him. Hey listen, let me ask you somethin', son. What's this bullshit lies we've been hearing about you winning some sort of award or something? - Uh, yeah, it was more of a misunderstanding. I didn't win anything. (sniffing) - I smell bullshit boy, a big ol' steaming pile of it! - Tell 'em, daddy! - Why don't you get yourself a job and contribute something to society. - Yo, Spielberg! Nice one, guy. I heard you notched up another rejection? Going for a Guinness world record? - How did you guys hear about this? - I saw it on Instagram, I saw it on Instagram, Instagram, Instagram, Instagram, son. - [Sam] And now the young have shown up to feed. I'm like an Easter ham. This town is going to be chewing on my gristle for years. - Well, if he's gone he's gone, we still gotta paint. And pick up two weeks of dog shit 'cause we're late again. - Well I got good news and good news; Patton's gone and I'm divorced. Let's paint. (upbeat music) Aw Jojo, you're killing me, man. That ain't painting music, we need some rock n' roll. - Asian is good, too. - Asian music? - Zen, my brother. - What happened to you? Help me out Sam-alam-a-ding-dong, what kind of music do you like to listen to? Sammy? You alright up there? - Yeah, all good, man. - Quit napping on the job, bitch. Who wants a beer? - I'm good. - Guys, something was wrong with her eyes. - Whose eyes? - It wasn't her eyes that were the problem, it was her ass. Popper? - It was her ass. - Sam. Sam? What are you looking at? - I don't know, man. Give me a second. Uh, guys, we got a problem up here. - Yeah, we don't have enough beer. - Shit! Go, go, go! We've got a problem, we've got a problem. - Yo, yo, what the fuck's the problem, man? - The colonel, man, he's fucked up! Hide! - Be careful, man. Slow down, man! - Hey! - Come on! - What, is he butt-naked or something? - Sam! - Shit! Agh! Ah, shit! (yelling) - Go, go, go, go, go! - Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! - Go, go, go, Popper!

Let's get the fuck out of here. - No, Jojo, let's stick around, maybe play a little Backgammon. - Did you see his face? Did you see that shit? - He's possessed by a demon! Probably that Asian curse. - There ain't no Asian curse, it's rabies, and I ain't getting 18 shots in my abs. - What the hell is that? - Patton. - Oh that's rabies. - Well that's one dog you're better than, Sam. What the hell are you going to do with that? Cook him to death? - You guys got all the good shit. I'm trying my best. - Shut up, guys. Alright we're gonna make a run for it, alright? We're gonna get to the van, we're gonna lock the doors, we're gonna get the fuck off this street. - Alright, let's do it. - Jojo, the ladle, man, you look ridiculous.

Go! - Shit, man. - Oh fuck. - We need to call the police. - What? - We need to call the police. - We are two months behind on our dojo rent, he's our only client. - Okay, at the very least we have to contact the Humane Society and report this. - You might as well report Sam too. Hey, he's the one feeding Noodles vomit pudding on the floor. - You guys don't even fuckin' care. - Sam. - What? - Your place. - What the hell? - Hey guys! - Pam! Uh, what are you doing here? Guys. - What? I ain't saying nothin'. - What are you doing here? - Oh, uh, I knocked and the door was open, and I came in and saw the place and, well. It was not big deal. - Thank you. - No big deal? There was vomit like, everywhere. - There was? - [Announcer] We interrupt your regular programing. - Holy crap! - [Announcer] This is the emergency broadcast system. This is not a test. Repeat, this is not a test. State and local authorities have issued a countywide warning. - Sam. - [Announcer] Stay indoors, lock all doors and windows. - Holy shit. - The authorities will be issuing further instructions through the emergency broadcast system. - Sam, is that your mailman chasing Mrs. Henry's dog? (dramatic music) - Mom, please, please stop. Mom please! - There is something seriously wrong, your mom is whack. (moaning) (bright music) * Moments are such fleeting things * * It's strange though * What rapture one brings - Sam? Sam, Sam! What the hell are you doing, man? This is not a fucking movie! Come on, let's go! - Man we are not going to survive without this weaponry. We need some damn guns. - I don't have any guns, I have a camera. - Who gives a damn? - How are we the only people in Texas that don't own guns? - Let's go to my uncle's! - [Together] Pistol's. - [DJ] Alright, let's take a phone call here. Good morning, you're live on the air with Morning Fiasco. There's nobody there. There's nobody there. Uh, guys? (yelling) (sirens blaring) - Looks like we've got company. Ready to whoop some ass, little brother? - Yeah. - (laughs) Let's go. - Wait! Yeah, they're just regulars, man. - Let's whoop their ass anyway. - Pistol. You here? Uncle P! Pistol? Pistol! - What the hell is going on here, huh? Somebody better start talking, quick. - You want the short or the long version? - Short. Very short. - Alright, so the town has been overrun... - Corsicana has been overrun by bloodythirsty, crazed zombies. They may be rabid. Either way it's very bad. We came to you for guns. - Hey, any of these work? - Does a pig shit turds, huh? - Mhm. - What kind of idiots gonna keep working pistols in a roadhouse bar? - None of these work? - Did somebody say Pistol? - Mr. Love strikes again. Now what're we going to do? - Are you kidding me? - Shit happens, Sam, I'm sorry about that, okay? Now the rest of you idiots, outta here, the joke's over, go home. - We're being serious. (banging) - Somebody open it. - No, don't get it, don't get it! Ibo, do not get that door. - Who is it? - It's Virginia, Dani... - It's Virginia, Dani? - And Horatio! - And Horatio. - Horatio? Leave him out there. - What? Open the door. (yelling) - What the hell is wrong with you people? - We got shot at. What the hell is happenin'? - They have got the entire town blocked off. - I got it on my phone. - There were bodies right in the middle of the street. - Oh Goddamn, oh shit! Fuck me. - Oh my God. I am calling my dad. - Can we have some guns? - How is it that no one understands the guns are for decoration? - Pistol, we're pretty hungry. You got anything to eat? - Beer nuts, chips. - Sweet. - Sam, no more lies. - Pistol, this is not a joke. Something is seriously wrong here. - What am I doing here with you people? Pistol, take me home. - It's like two for one night at the sizzler out there. We need guns like, pronto. - And ammo. - And beer. - Ammo. - [Both] Jerky. (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - Why exactly are we not sending in the military to address this tragedy? - Look, if these people want to kill themselves, let them go at it. Where I'm from, we call that trimming the herd. - Trimming, trimming the herd! - Now this is a perfect example of us not taking care of our citizens. - Citizens? Who said they were citizens? - No, no, no, no! - Who the hell are you to judge who is an American? - They would not be running wild in the street. - The people of the Southern States are as American as the rest of us. If you were in this room I would bitch-slap you right now. (intense music) - Stay together. * It * Ain't real - Man, this sucks. I had plans. - What? - I was gonna finish my associates degree. - Uh oh, look up here. Hey, hey, Sam, check it out. - Alright, get it. Nice! - Yeah, yeah! What? - You gotta hit him. - For real? - It's a zombie, hit it. - That ain't right. (yelling) - Get it! - Oh my God! - Holy shit! Yes! * I'm losing myself * I dunno when to brace myself * I dunno when to brace myself - Alright come on, let's go. - [Reporter] This just in: the White House released drone footage of the chaos in Corsicana. I warn you these images are horrific. The rioters are attacking innocent people in their cars. - The town is right next to the Mexican border, no wall, they're coming in, these damn illegal aliens take over the town. (speaks in foreign language) - Did you see the footage? What are you going to do? Tell me; what are you going to do when they come in and they beat down your door, hm? Oh I'm gonna give 'em a hug. No, I'll tell you what you want; you want to get a gun, a big gun. That's right a gun, so that you can protect your family before they steal your dog and your daughter. - Alright, guys, go over there. (howling) - I love this fuckin' country! - Horatio get out of my frame. - No, no, no, no, see, I am making my own movie. - Seriously, really dude? - Really, really, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm doing one about a shitty filmmaker making a horror film and trying to use real zombies to make his film, that's what I'm doing. - You really think someone would watch that? - Jojo! - Keep your voice down. - Beer! - Sh, don't, don't! - Yes. - Don't move. - Yes. - Don't! (laughing) (intense music) (gun firing) - Get out of here. - Fucking A! - Weapons work better with ammunition. * It's making me sad now * A little sad, yeah, yeah * Gets me, memory - What's going on? - Seems like everyone thinks the bar is the best place to be when all hell breaks loose. - We're gonna be lucky if we even make it out of this town alive. - Jojo, you gotta stop looking at me while I'm taking a piss. - I, I'm not, what are you talking about? - And it doesn't matter anyway, wasn't that always the case, I mean come on, man. How come my movies never go anywhere? - Because they suck? Except for your hair, and your acting. - Tibo my movies do not suck. I don't have production value, man. I've never had production value. - So you're going to film us while we get attacked by zombies. - No. (farting) I have an idea. (crowd applauds) - Alright, y'all, we're gonna take a break, we'll be back in just a few. - Hello, hey, Popper here, I've probably changed your oil, I know I've changed your oil. Or fixed something on your car or your bicycles. Hey, there's one man here tonight who saw the shit comin' before anybody. Like, like Nostradamus or something. He said the shit was gonna hit the fan, the zombies, the undead, and said zombie apocalypse, before anybody else knew what was happening. He's my main man, my best friend, Sammy P. - Oh for fuck's sake! His movie didn't even make it into the damn festival! - Yeah, no shit, dumbass. And we all know that now. But it's okay, you know why? Hit 'em, Jojo. - Sam has an idea. - That's right, Jojo. Ladies and gentleman, our zombie maestro of ceremonies, Sammy P! (crowd claps) - Thank you, Popper. - You're welcome. - Well, um, so I've been thinking, um, we're in crisis. The world out there is upside down; brother eating brother. And you know, we can sit here and we can drink and party 'till the bitter end, or, we could unite for a common cause. We can show the world that we are one people, that we are survivors, that we can beat unbeatable odds! And how do we show the world? I will document it! This town, yeah it might be dried up, we're sitting on an oilfield here, this is our goldmine! We can make a movie as one, and we will triumph! - Okay, so what's the movie? - Have you ever heard the phrase found footage? - Have you heard the term DOA, dead on arrival. Have you? You jackasses, go make your homemade movie, I'm gonna sit right here and drink my beer. - Come on, Bird Dog. We finally have a chance to make something of ourselves. - Oh shut up! You're drunk! (crowd booing) - Come on. - Hey, get off the stage! (intense rock music) - Listen, listen, big Jim. There are many, many, many bonuses to the film and entertainment industry. - Like what? - Number one, poontang. Number two De Niro, or money as we call it in the States. - Sure. - So, pussy and money. So think about it, think about it like this okay, like, you ever like work really hard to get into a chick's pants, like you really want it, and you spend a lot of money and time, you're not going to get any of that money or time back, but you get the experience, even if she's not very good you get the experience. Look, man, look, you are getting in on the ground level of so much production value. You never get this; real fucking zombies here in Corsicana.

Blech! Don't worry, Freedom Cakes are here! This is America, where we get to eat what we want, it's your God given right! Coming to a store near you on July 4th. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey. - Really like your handiwork back there. You guys have any film production experience? - No, boss, but as you can see we're productive. - Yeah, yeah you are. Better that way anyway, film production experience will make you jaded. You guys want to make a movie? - Why the hell are we here? - Ladies and gentleman, this is our destiny. We have a movie lot, right there. We have hair, we have make up, we have set... - Ahmm. - Yes? - Um, are you suggesting that we use real zombies? - Real, real zombies. Yes. We are going to make the first ever zombie film using real zombies. - What? - Sam, you know I'll do anything for a movie, kind of known for being a team player, but uh, isn't this a little dangerous? - Yes. Yeah, right? Working with zombies could be misconstrued as not a good idea. - Fair enough. - We're not going to use dangerous ones. - What kind of zombies are you planning on using? - Safe ones. Safer. - Safe zombies. - The only safe zombie is a dead zombie. - Got that straight, son. - [Both] Hah! - The name of our movie.

So, get us weapons, hatchets, shovels, bats, chainsaws, ladles, I don't care, anything is better than what we have, just remember it's lame to shoot zombies. Get us something fun to kill zombies with. (grunting) Red team, you guys are operation Munchies; we need food and drink! The school shut down the lunch program, right, Pam? Ugh, where do our taxes go? Get us food, guys. Green team, you guys are with me here at basecamp starting preproduction. Let's make movie magic here people, rendezvous here no later than 13:00.

This town's been one heatwave away from destroying itself for years. - Yeah, yeah, I know, it's just... I just wanna make sure no one's gonna get hurt, you know? - We're gonna sneak around, we're gonna watch chompers chasing people, that's it! - Okay. - I wonder if the sheriff's turned. I gotta go. I gotta go! So, you tell me we've got no weapons, a very meager craft services, and for a zombie, you got me a fifth grader in a retainer. (yelling) - We're making a movie! Let's review the following; I'm not gonna change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything, I've always been a freak. Okay, yeah, I've never liked it either. Okay, moving on. Another one from another John, a real 'Merican, courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway. And finally, screw it, let's do it, yes! Sir Richard Branson, yes! - Are you freakin' kidding me? This is what you've been doing while we've been out there risking our necks, huh? - Yeah, it's what I've been doing, and, you know, getting art department and a script together. You can't have a movie without a script. - Yeah, and we can't live without food, huh. I should have been on the red team. - Hey, man! We have like, enough gummy bears to last a month! Jeez, here! - I'm not worried about the food, I'm worried about being their food. They're fast. - Anything's faster than you, brother, the way you keep smoking that shit. - Don't hate, man! - Woah, woah, guys! - Okay, okay, okay! - Woah, guys, seriously! Come on, guys! - Mr. Pentergass, report to the principal's office, once you stop dicking around. So, Mr. Pentergass, what do you have to say for yourself? - I'm sorry sir, I didn't think using the school would be a big deal, it's been abandoned, - Mr. Pentergass, I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times. Spare me. Pentergass, this calls for greater action. This calls for something way more sizable in my response. This calls for Priscilla. 'Scuse me, sir? - Priscilla! Meet Priscilla, Mr. Pentergass! - Mr. Johnson you have a big gun, sir, - Shall we make a zombie film? (laughing) (grunting) - Hit me here. Yo, hit me here, hit me here. - Hey!

You gotta run to the car, c'mon! - You look stupid! - Tiffany, stay in character, c'mon. - Whatever happened to less is more, huh? - Okay, let's go. C'mon, c'mon, woman! - I don't want to! (yelling) Go, go! - I'm trying! - Go, go! - Cut! Beautiful! Yeah, alright! Very good. - Hey, Sam, man. What's the plan on getting them back in? - Oh, shit. Uh, that's a good question. - Oh... Alright, time to go, people, let's go! - I should get some of this! - Move, move! - Move, move, move, move! - Pistol, get the zombies! - I'm gettin' this, I'm gettin' this! - How are we with these idiots? - This is crazy. - Carl, Carl, come on! Dude, what's wrong with your eyes? - You're fucked up, man. You went too far, now you're gonna pay. - [Reporter] This is a special report. Why, America, why? Our investigative team is on the hunt for the cause of the chaos in Corsicana. - I frequently, we, support a lot of charitable organizations. Locally and nationally, internationally. - So me and my son and my grandson, Bubba and Bubba Jr., we drink a 30-pack together. And that night I have this idea; hey, what if we got liberals to send us money? - It's the Worldwide Redneck Fund, and it allows people like us to adopt a redneck. - You know, it's like adopt a kid over there in Africa, you know, them little black kids, you can feed one for 10 cents. - Occasionally he would ask for cash. - You know, we got certain rights, and that's a right to worship God, a right to carry my gun... - And I thought we were making progress. He said to me once, I'm considering about going gluten free for a week. - And I don't know what the other ones are, the other ones don't even matter. - The latest gun that he bought, he didn't name it. - Oh, Ethyl? This is my AR10. - What's happening in Texas is certainly distressing and we're all concerned. - We got a silencer or suppressor on it. - What I think my wife is trying to say is... - Please don't tell me what I'm trying to say, thank you, I know what I'm trying to say. - The more money we have the more bullets we can get. - I sent 400 recycling containers. - The more stuff we can shoot. - You sent four hundred recycling bins to Bubba? - There's a lot of things wrong with this country. - I thought Bubba was a place in Ethiopia. - There ain't no daddies anymore. - Do they even recycle in Texas? - Killed a lot of hogs. - I sent him kombucha. - Money started pourin' in, man. - The poems of Maya Angelou. - Let freedom ring! - You know I could use a little kombucha right now. - Okay, guys, I know we're tired, I know it took us a while to get here, I know we're down to our last two bags of chips, but listen, we got great stuff back there, and yeah, we had to strike fast and we left some stuff behind, and Carl's probably dead, but what is the classic location for a zombie movie? - Corsicana, Texas. - Yes, more local though. - Cemetery? - No. - Hospital. - No. - Black hole? - Okay, that's above our budget. - Oh! Ninja dojo! - That's very gratuitous. - Submarine. - A theater! An abandoned theater! With concessions. - They got beer? - Guys, we're hungry, I'm starving. Let's kill two birds with one stone, or one shot! Huh? - Really? - Okay, come on, let's go. (dramatic music) Action! - Sam! Listen, why are you filming this? - Stay in character. - I would love to, but I do not know what I am playing. - Fellatio, just go with it, you're screwing up the scene. - Alright guys, we've got to do this again. Please, stop breaking the fourth wall. - Negative, this is a search and destroy mission, there's only one way; forward! - Follow the man with the gun. (soft music) - Nut up, ya pansies, I'm covering the rear. - Yes captain, my captain. - Guys, stay together, we've got to make sure it's clear. - Hey, Fellatio! - Holy shit, ah! Okay. (laughs) Look at that. - There's a concessions. Okay, Popper, take this. - Yup. - Okay, Tibo, Jojo, try to sneak around, right? You gotta get back there but there are zombies, so try to get as close as you can to them, okay? Alright, alright, are you ready? (growling) - Ah, shit! (yelling) Shit, shit! Help, she's gonna bite me! - Okay, I got you, I got you! - I'm acting. - Shit! (yelling) Shit! You gotta get her! She's gonna bite me, I'm serious! What are you doing? Get the shot! - Okay, okay! - Oh my God, oh God! - I'm getting the shot! - She's gonna kill me! No I'm actually serious! Did you get the shot? - I don't know, I was really confused. - Yeah. - Let's go, men! We are in hostile territory! - Oh shit. Get up, get up, get up! - Come on, come on! - that's a negative, Horatio, time to go, come on! - I cut this guy's head off! This is my moment. - Hey, hey! - What? - I think it's Carl. It's Carl, man! - Wait, wait. - Get the, get the camera, get the camera! - I don't think he notices us. I got it, man! I got it! - Good job! - Thanks, Carl! - We miss you, bro! - To be, or not to be, that is the question. - Go, go, oh shit! Shit! Fuck! - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Grab the door, hold it, hold it, hold it! - This way, troops! - Oh man, oh! He's been bit! What are we going to do? - I'm leaving, let's go. (yelling) - [Sam] Horatio, you're going to be alright, we're going to get you help. - Oh give it a rest, Sam, you know the script. God that hurts! That hurts! - Can you actually feel it coursing through your veins? - Uh, Sam, you should see this, bro. - Sam, Sam, listen to me! - Now is not a good time, not a good time, you guys! - Sam! - What? What, fine! What, what do you want? - Come here, Sam. - No. - Sam, listen. For fucks sake, I'm not going to bite you, Sam, just come here. - Okay. - God! - Sam, no. - Hey, I'll be alright. I'll be alright. Here. - Mhm. It's your life. - Sam, Sam, Sam, listen to me, I want to tell you something. I want to ask you something, rather. Look at me. - Okay. - Do you know how much your films suck? They are horrible, Sam. - Okay. - Stop it, Sam! Look at me, look at me! - Okay, Horatio! I'm looking at you. - They are horrendous, Sam! You are a talentless sack of shit, but this, this is something truly genius. Sam. This could be something really special. - Okay. - You need a good zombie transformation scene. Voila! Just make sure that you get it. Don't fuck it up! - Okay! - Promise me. - Okay, I promise. - Okay, we should get to filming, I'm really starting not to feel good. (yelling) Ooh the anger! - Okay. - Okay, just um, turn it on Popper, turn on the camera, turn it on. - I'm rolling, I'm rolling. - Okay, everyone settle, alright? Quiet on the set. Ready? - Yeah. - Sam, this isn't right. We should be finding him help. - Pam, I'm about to shoot the most important scene of my life, and his life, which is just about over. So just let me freakin' do this. - Sam, this isn't okay! - Alright, Tiffany. You're up. - No, no, no! I'm not going near him! - You are in the scene! - I don't care! No! Dani will do it, Dani will do it! - No! - Fine. Dani, you're in. Come on! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Right here, right here. - Let's go, people, I am actually dying over here. - Come on, c'mon buddy, c'mon! Turn around, face to camera, alright. Popper, here we go. This is the shot! - I got the shot. - Okay. Okay, this is the scene, you found your best friend, he's been bitten. - Are you ready Ocean Spray? - Yeah. - Okay, action! - I always knew that this town was going to be the death of me! All of these fat asses, taking up all the space. With their oversized derrieres and their abundant bottoms and their kingsize rumps! Run! Run. (farting) You can still get out, unless you let the ones like me go. Shoot me! - Spray! Say the line. Come on, say your line, man! - Shoot me! Shoot me, shoot me. You skinny little shit! Before I eat your little slut of a girlfriend! I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm com, ah! - Ocean! - This is fucked up. Is he supposed to do that? - Dude, that's not in the script! - He's a zombie! - Man, fuck this shit! These are our friends, you shoot it! - Fine! Eldad! - Maestro! - Sam, what are you doing? - This is great. - These are your friends! - And I will tell their story! (yelling) (gun firing) - Dammit! Dammit, who did that? I did not say cut! - Sorry, Sam, I can't let Horatio go out like that. - (speaks in foreign language) brother. - Have you lost your mind? This is sick! - I have this under control. - Under control? - What is happening? I thought he had to get bit! Did anyone see him get bit? - Have we all lost our minds? - Did anyone see anything unusual with Ocean? - He had the serious cause of the munchies, guys. He ate like five of these bitches! - Shit, it's the Freedom Cakes! (yelling) - Oh my God, I baked those things. Does that mean I'm going to turn into one? How do I look? - Stay away from me! Those are gross! - We bake to box at least 50,000 of those a day! We just shipped a shit ton of them out. - Where? - Nationwide! - Oh my God, we're all gonna die! - We've got incoming, people. Let's go, let's go, into the theater! - What about Horatio? - There's nothing we can do for him now. Let's go, come on! - Ocean! - Come on Jessie, we have to go! We have to go, Jessie, come on! - Are you guys insane? We are going to finish this film, we are going to be famous! Get back in here! Come on! Oh, do it for Horatio! (intense music) - Come on, shh, shh. Come on, lock the door. - Okay, okay, I got it. - Popper! I'm sorry, alright? I lost my head, man. We gotta go! What the? - Sam, stay in character. You gotta stay in character, Sam. - A dolly shot? Okay. - Why am I not a zombie? - Popper! - Hey. - Popper, holy shit, we gotta get out of here, man. - Dude, look at this. - Woah. - Zombie hotties! We gotta get this shot! Yeah, you wanna stream this movie? Dudes are gonna look, they're gonna see no titties, sausagefest, they go right through it. - Yeah. - Oh! - I don't have the camera. - What? - Dude, we just got to get out of here! - Catch up to ya. - Been saving this for a long time. I call it El Morte. It's inside here. Yeah. - El Morte? - El Morte. - Dude, that wouldn't even get a fifth grader high. - Oh! Famous last words, man. Ready? - Yeah. (yelling) - Oh, the Freedom Cakes. Oh wait, the Freedom Cakes. The, the, I'm not a zombie! Oh my God, I'm not a zombie. I am not, I am not a zombie. - What's your name? (yelling) - And now we have exclusive footage for you from Corsicana, and the carnage that is happening there. People are rioting, screaming, you'll notice fires in the streets. People appear to be in nothing but survival mode, using just their wits and their surroundings to survive what can only understandably be viewed as the apocalypse. - These people are so blasted! - Why aren't your lips moving? - Isn't that your sister? - Are my eyes still there? - We're in Texas. - Come on, come on, come on. Yeah get back, come on, come on. (horns honking) (wind howling) - [Sam] But look at them all. These are my people. They all want me, finally, this whole town wants me, they need me. You can do this, Sam, your day has come! (farting) - Hey! I'm all out of bullets, I'm going hand to hand! - What are we going to do? - Why don't we just film ourselves dying? - That's a great idea, buddy. - Alright, I'm going to draw them away. I'm going that way, you guys. Get o the streets, try to get out of town. - Sam, no, you don't have to do this! - Pam, I'm so sorry. This is my fault. Thank you, thank you for always believing in me. - Sam, Sam, no, you don't have to do this. - I love you. - Sam! (yelling) Sam, Sam, no! - Come on! Come on! Let's go! Come on! - Go get 'em, Sammy! - Really? Why does anyone ever listen to that guy? - Come on! Let's go, come on, here! Come on! Here we go, come on! This way, come on, come on. I'm delicious, I'm tasty, come on right over here! Take a bite of me! Yeah, yeah alright, yeah you want some of this! Yeah! Muscle, a little bit of fat for ya, yeah! I'm a tasty man! Right here, right here, yeah! Look at these meaty thighs! Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, let's go! (yelling) Well, shit. Yeah, I'm a dead man. Great idea, Samuel. Look at this, that kid is eating his mom's kneecap! I have never seen that, oh my God, I don't even know what that guy's eating. What the hell? Dammit. Zombie rain? Figures, now the heavens are raining production value. Man, this hurts! Man, this movie was going to be beautiful. Feels good to finally nail my part. Eldad? Nice shot, Eldad. (speaks in foreign language) - Sam, Sam! Sam, you're gonna be okay, we're gonna get you help. - I'm sorry, guys, I'm a shitty filmmaker. - Yeah, yeah you are. - What the hell is this? (yelling) - We're gonna get you help, little buddy. C'mon. - Come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! - [Tiffany] Hurry, he's losing blood. - Come on now, guys. Hold up, wait on me! I got a bad knee! You sons of bitches! I saved your lives about 12 times tonight! C'mon now! (laughing) - [Sam] I always knew this town would be the death of me. - What's this? A red carpet premiere into the great beyond? Nope. Turns out getting bit just hurts, it doesn't actually turn you into one. When the world goes to shit, it's a gift I say. What I needed was just a little chaos to get my shot, and it happened, they gave it to me. I got money, honey wagons, respect, 20 something interns happy as hell to get me some shitty coffee drink. I don't even like coffee, I get one every 20 minutes! God it feels good! - I am beyond excited! - Well I play myself, so that's fun. - Jojo! - And that's where I get to meet my leading man. (yelling) - It's the best day of my life, thank you all so much! Thank you, Corsicana! - And spoiler alert, are you guys expecting? - Well we were expecting to keep it a secret. - I will see you in there! Come on! - As I sit here watching this, it's like it's not me, it's some different version of me; an imposter, it's a fake! Which it is, I mean, Ryan Reynolds looks nothing like me. I can't help but think what would have happened if I had actually gotten into that shitty festival, or what would have happened if I hadn't lied about the whole damn thing. Oh well, by the looks of the reviews, I'm not getting the chance to make Fat Ass Zombies 2 anytime soon. That's okay, I kind of had my heart on making Zombie Space Vikings 2: The Horny Revenge. - [Reporter] Parents beware, the Freedom Cake Challenge is sweeping social media. Teenagers are finding the deadly cakes that haven't been turned in and destroyed by the authorities and are filming themselves eating them. This is a very dangerous situation, and we urge anyone with knowledge of any cakes still not turned in to report it immediately. And parents, please make sure you speak to your children about the dangers of these cakes, and also have Colin Street Bakery Honey in your cupboard. As we reported earlier, this honey was found to be the only antidote for anyone poisoned by eating the cakes.
