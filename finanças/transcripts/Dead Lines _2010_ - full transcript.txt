- We set up fair-trade agreements with women's organizations in poverty-stricken areas of Turkey, Morocco and Indonesia, with future development scheduled for India and central and southern Africa. - So tell us, how does this work exactly? - Being properly compensated for their labour and their goods enables them, in turn, to support their families, educate their children, create local industry and build economic growth. - And your partners? I mean, Fyne Designs is not just Sophie Fyne. Is it? - No, we are 3 equal partners with 3 very specific talents. - Ian Jameson, for example, he's had a lot of international recognition for his innovative development strategies. A bit of a whiz kid, would you say? - No, he definitely is. And Adam Fyne brilliantly manages our finances, which enables both Ian and I to do what we do best. - And what is it that you do best, Sophie? - Using regional and sustainable materials, I try to design clothing and accessories that reflect the strength and resilience of women... ...honouring their cultural skills and craftsmanship and celebrating their beauty. - Wonderful. Now, with only a few select retailers carrying the Fyne Designs label, to now launching your very own store in Manhattan's coveted Lower East Side, how do you feel? - Positive. Exhilarated. Um... Mostly terrified. - But let's talk a little bit about your highly-anticipated ad campaign. It's expected to be very cutting edge, to really make a statement. Tell us. - It's called Empower, stressing how women should not be victimized by fashion. That means those wearing it, buying it or making it. - Great. Thank you so much for taking time out to speak to us and, we wish you all the best. With the opening just 7 days away, we'll be following closely. - Thank you. - I'm Megan Harris for Fashion Uncovered. ♪♪ Come on, let's go - Gorgeous! Very pretty. ♪ Baby I love that. Don't move, Danielle. All right. Little more to the right and shove a little bit right. Great look. ♪ I am free now, baby... ♪ Chin up, girls. Gorgeous. So hot. Very pretty. Love it! We're almost there, girls. Just a few more. For god sake! What now? - No, seriously, like, my arm is killing me. - Yeah, well... Let's take 20. - Thank you, everybody. It looks amazing. - I don't know about you, but I'm kind of turned on right now. - Yeah, that would be why I hired you and why I would never sleep with you. - Are sure about this? I mean, an ad campaign about a clothing line without any clothes. I mean, I've done some pretty out-there stuff, believe me. - We talking personally or professionally? - Is there a difference? - No, I've got something important to say and I've got a rare opportunity to do it. So with your help, we can get somebody to hear what it is and maybe even do something about it. - So you think there's actually more to life than satisfying your own needs and desires? Nah. - Get out of here! Hey, honey! - Hey, Mom. - Home from school? - Not yet. I was gonna stop by the studio and maybe help out with the photo shoot. - Spencer. - I wanna show you I can do it. I'm ready. - How many times do we have to have this conversation? It's not gonna happen. - I don't get it. You work in fashion and with models who are younger than me. What's the difference? - If you had to pay for oxygen, you wouldn't waste so much of it on this. -It's not fair. Daddy would let me. - We'll talk about this when I'll get home. -Fine. Well, I tried to order... - Hi. - Hi. I missed you. - I missed you too. Won't need this either. - Ooh! What's wrong? Are you OK? - I'm just great. ♪♪ This time it's also here ♪ You came to me again ♪ Making me stronger ♪ We're moving up ♪ Keep the flame burning longer ♪ ♪ You're making it stronger ♪ It's building up higher ♪ - Corner loft, 5110. No, the key just snapped off in the lock. OK, I'll see you in an hour. Thanks. My god! What happened? - What is that? - Your extremely clumsy husband tripped and was impaled on a bead-carving tool in one of the workshops. - Did you see a doctor? - I did, but there was a woman there who fixed me up good. Looks vicious, but it's better than it was. It's nothing, come on! - Yeah, it doesn't look like nothing. - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Wow! Remind me to go away more often if that is the welcome I get from my beautiful daughter when I get home. - She's saving money on oxygen. - I bet. Come on. - I missed you. - Yes, I missed you too. And you're late. Come eat. - Models don't eat. - Spencer, sweetheart, you will model over my dead body. You're too young. Besides, 6 months ago, you were ripping up fashion magazines protesting the exploitation of women. Now all of a sudden you want to be a model. - It's a woman's privilege to change her mind. - Yes. Yes, it is. Except you are not a woman yet. - Daddy! - Legally, your mom's got a point. My point is if you declare your womanhood, it weakens your argument to be calling to Daddy for help. - Hey! Not near the Chanel, Spencer! - Sometimes I think you care more about that stupid sketch book than me. - Ouch! What's going on with you two? - It's been 3 weeks of that. - Yeah? What prompted it? - Her 16th birthday. - So, how was the trip? - Well, after jumping through way too many frustrating hoops and time zones, everything is finally arranged and on schedule. - Good. Did you bring samples of the beaded garments with you? - Ian's got them. - I'll get them later. - Well, he's not back yet. - What? Is there a problem? You just said everything was on track. - Everything is on track, Sophie. You know Ian. He's thorough. He decided to head back to Fez to triple-check everything. - Reminds me. Did you see this about Ian? - Yes. I did. Nice. - It's good, right? - Sure getting a lot of press, isn't he? - For our company. - I know. I just... I know. He'll be back in a few days. Just in time for the opening. - I'm glad you're home. - Glad to be home. - Spencer! You're gonna be late for school! Hey! You know, I heard this rumour that models don't eat, but students do. - Have a good day, sweetie. Well, you know, we made it through the terrible twos. This is gonna be a breeze. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Sophie, we've got a problem. - "challenge," Alexa, not "problem". - The colour of the fabric dyed at the workshop in Fez doesn't match our finished purse style SF1227. But they said it turned out nice anyway. So the problem is-- Sorry. The challenge is if you need to see the colour for approval, it'll delay getting to the embroiderers, the beaders and the sewers, postponing the scheduled completion and shipping date for the bags. - Right. I'll take care of it. Thank you. That one? Yes. Here. - Come on! - Jeff! Jeff, come here. - Hope all this publicity isn't going to your handsome head. - Excuse me? - Hey, Adam. I thought you were Ian calling me back. - Networks are a little spotty in the more remote villages. So what's up? -You said he was going back to Fez, right? - Yeah, that's right. - We've got a dye-lot question that needs an answer, so I thought maybe-- - Perhaps he can take his handsome head and check in with Mrs. Bashiri, right? - Exactly. - If I can reach him, I will ask. - Thank you. Bye. - See ya. - And how's life in the art world? - It's insane. The worse the economy gets, the more people need to sell their collections. It's actually brought some amazing pieces to the market. I'm overseeing this huge auction this week... You OK? - Sorry, Drea. It's just Spencer. Wish there was way to make her understand that her mother does know what's good for her. - Well, if you figure it out you'll revolutionize parenting. Listen, you are a fantastic mother who loves her daughter. You guys are gonna figure this out. By the time she's 40 at the latest. - Great! Thank you so much. And the deadline for the opening isn't exactly helping. It's 5 days away. I don't know if our shipment is going to get here in time. Everything we have is riding on this. It's my turn. - Thanks. - Thank you. It's just a lot, you know. - Yeah. - Mesdames. - Claudio. - Hi. - Your whole saving-the world- one-designer-outfit- at-a-time thing is literally starting to wear thin. There's a certain way that the fashion business has always been done and will continue to be done. You're getting to be too good at making us all look very bad. - You don't need Sophie for that. - You can change the way you run your company. - Enable everybody involved to benefit, rather then just a select few. Or you can stick to your old ways and take and take and never give anything back. This way, I can sleep at night. There's a lot of amazing women all over the world working with us, who can do the same thing. - Rest assured, Sophie, dear. I sleep like a baby. Besides, you should never mess with a classic. Speaking of which, any chance you're ready to part with that beloved Chanel book of yours? - No, Claudio. - A word to the wise: Fashion has its price and it's very, very high. - Um, I'm sorry, Ms. Fyne. But there seems to be a problem with your credit card. - Like I said, very high. - That's impossible. I'm sorry, would you mind running it again? - Um, I already did. - Next time. - He just keeps getting older while his playmates stay the same age. - Maybe he's taking up babysitting. Probably needs cash after the rotten year he's had. - See? Maybe karma does exist. - Well, give Spencer a hug for me? - I'll try. Bye. - Hey, Mike, it's lunch time. Let's go grab a bite. Look out! - Listen, if we don't have it this week, my guys are gonna be delayed. There's no way we can finish on time. - Listen, we'll finish this later. OK, Jerry? Thank you. I promise. Hey! How was lunch? - It was OK, except why would my credit card be declined? - What? Um, I don't know. It's strange. I'll give them a call. - And did you get a hold of Ian about the dye lot? - I did, so the purses can be sized and cut before heading out to Meknes for embroidery, beading and finishing. Yes, I did. - Thank you. And when's he coming back? - Actually, he's in Tunisia, checking out some new suppliers. - The opening's in 5 days! We need everybody here, not Tunisia. That's not best use of his time. - I'll call him. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey! Is that my key? - Yes, your new copy. - Yes, thank you. Hello? OK. Thanks. Customs. - Our shipment? That would be really good. - See ya. Bye. - Bye. Hello. - Sophie, we really gotta go. Katif's waiting in the studio. - Yeah. Thanks. - The dried fibres of the lokta bark woven into the fabric gives it more body and texture. - These are exquisite, Katif. So the lokta plant is sustainable? - We harvest just the bark, which regenerates. - I can already think of a dozen designs for the next collection with this. Let's add, um... Let's add a 20-yard cut of this one to my order. You know what? - One each of this and the grey. - Always a pleasure. Um, Sophie. I do have to talk to you about something that isn't sustainable. - Of course. - Our payment terms. We need to switch to COD. - Don't be ridiculous. As long as we've known each other, you know we have impeccable credit. - Word on the street right now is otherwise. Big city, small street. - Ka-- Katif, there's gotta be some kind of mistake. - I'm sorry, Sophie. It's business. Yo, yo! - You're totally worth it. No! Yo! Hold up! ...especially in the summer. - Exactly. - It's like a nice... - Hey, Justin! - Hi. Yeah, nice... Hey, pass it here! Good! You know it! - Adam, I just met with Katif. He wants payment on delivery. Do we have a problem? - Yeah, we do. Mr. Fyne! Please. - I gotta go. - Have a look. - I'm FBI Agent Fincher. Thank you both for coming down. With high temperatures this time of year, "decomp" was severely accelerated, so making time of death almost impossible to determine. We do know the "vic" is female and was most likely strangled. - I'm--I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. Aside from the fact that an article of our clothing was found, what does this have to do with us? The tracking label was fake, but the delivery address of the container was yours, so anyway you look at it we'd talk to you about this body. All the other ID, shipping documents, country of origin, all has to be verified. She could have been placed inside at any point along the way. - Was there anything else found in the container? - Nothing. Any idea who she might be? - No. - ... Do you know of anyone who might have something against your company, trying to send you a message of some sort? No. No. No? - Our company's philosophy differs from a lot of our competitors. Some have expressed their displeasure vocally, but, I mean, none of them would do it this far. - No. - Well, there's more questions than answers at this point. We'll contact you when we know more. And please let us know if anything else out of the ordinary comes up. - OK. Anything we can do to help. - Thanks. - Thank you. - What was that, Adam? I mean, that was clearly our label, our fabric. Who would do something like this? - I don't know. - And why? - I don't know, Sophie. Maybe we got caught up in something we have nothing to do with. - It's no random incident. How is this connected to us? God, what is wrong with me? - What? - This could be somebody's mother, somebody's daughter. - Listen, we'll know more when they do. And then we'll deal with it, together, OK? - A near-tragedy at New York's Port Authority earlier today led to the discovery of another tragedy bizarrely interwoven with fledgling enviro-design company Fyne Designs. Question now is how will fair trade becoming fear trade affect their highly anticipated flagship store opening just 5 days away? - Have to prepare a statement. - Saying what? - I don't know, Adam, We have to say something. We gotta take control of the situation. - No, we gotta stay focused on the things that we actually can control. - Trying to make their lives better and look what happens. - Listen, we don't even know what happen to her. - What about Katif, and probably other suppliers, asking for COD? How do we control that? - It's just simple math, more money going out than coming in right now, that's all. Here. It's all straightened out. Sophie, listen to me. It's just like this in the beginning. The work at the store, it's never ever what it's quoted. That's what I was talking to Jerry about. And the ad campaign, I mean... it's great... but it's a lot. - When did you say the shipment is coming in? Our shipment? - Yeah. The flight's coming in day after next. - Nothing like cutting it close. - It's gonna be OK. - Thank you. Hello. Yeah, got your message. Yeah, I got a sample. We're gonna have to talk about new pricing. Hey. Can't sleep? No. - Did you see it in the news? - I was tweeted. - Listen, um, everything's gonna be OK. There's nothing to worry about, all right? - Dad? - What did mom do to make you like her... love her? - What do you mean, what did she do? - I mean, when you guys first met, did she talk or dress in a certain way that made you notice her? - Um... when I first met your mother, it was... - Love at first sight? - No. No, no, no, no. It was more like loathe at first sight. - What do you mean? - It was the first few days of our design school and we were put in the same group in marketing class, and our job-- our job was just to make a business plan. That's it. But your mother-- Your mother, she was-- Well, you know, she's idealistic and she's--she's stubborn. - I must get the stubborn part from her then. - For the record, you said that. I did not say that. - Yeah. - OK. Those things at first, they just-- They drove me nuts. But those were the things that made up who she was. Who she is. An independent-thinking, determined woman who will never ever take no for an answer if there's even the slightest possibility of a yes. So no, she never had to say anything or do anything or be anything other than exactly what she was, because that's the person I fell in love with. So is there a reason you're asking, or... - No reason. - No. No, no reason. Of course not. - I love you, Daddy. - I love you too. Good night. - Can you leave that on? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. - Spencer, honey, wait up. I'm going your way. So when is there a moratorium on hating her mother? - She doesn't hate you. How can she? She's just like you. She's determined, she's a perfectionist. - Really? - Absolutely. And right now she's determined to make your life a perfect hell. - Coming to work? - I gotta run errands for the opening. - She might get her determination from me but the ability to tune me out is from you. - Spencer! Spencer! - Spencer! Spencer? Spencer. You OK? - What? - God! - I'm fine! Why? - Honey, you were almost run over! - What? - Honey, you can't walk around in your own little bubble. - We're serious about this. - OK! I'm sorry. - Honey! - Did you catch the license plate number? - No. - No. No. - The make of the car? - Um, black SUV. American. - I might recognize the driver if I saw him again. - Listen, it just happened so fast. - Can't you do something? Whoever this was, was trying to run down our daughter. - You're not giving me a lot to go on here. Maybe it wasn't intentional. Well, if any other details come to mind, let me know. We'll see what we can do. Would you mind if I took some of these? They'll be returned. - Yeah, of course. - Thank you. - No! Crap! - Sophie. - Claudio. - Feeling the pressure of a deadline, are we? Or perhaps dead bodies? - Well, that's a little nasty even for you, isn't it? The quicker you rise the faster you fall, my dear. The trick is not to look down. - Fortunately, I'm not afraid of heights, Claudio. - You can design a new wheel, Sophie, but you can never re-invent it. Best not to die trying. What the-- No. What the heck? - They're in! - What's in? - The proofs from the photo shoot. These are good. These are really good. My god! Spencer. Spencer! Spencer! - Hey! What's going on? - This! - Spencer, get over here now. - What's going on? Why are you yelling? - Recognize these? - Look. I know what you're thinking. But I was fully dressed. Doesn't look that way. - Your photographer thought it would be fun. He used his computer to put me in the picture. - Why, Spencer? - To shock you into seeing how good a model I could be. - Shock me? That's great! Why haven't you answered your phone? I've been calling. - I fainted. - What? Have you eaten anything? - I had an apple. I came home earlier but my keys didn't work. I was feeling kind of woozy, so I went to the park to sit down and I guess I fainted. Next thing I know, a man helps me up and insists on taking me home. - Whoa. What man? - He said he knew you through business. A Mr. Cassadrian or something. He's out front. He said he would wait to make sure I got in OK. - You're not eating to the point of passing out, and now this photo stunt you pulled! What are you thinking, Spencer? You're so grounded. Give me the cell phone. - What? - Cell phone. - Daddy! - Cell phone. - Maybe we should cut her a little slack? - She's starving herself. - I know. - She went behind my back to model and now she could have ended up with God knows who? She's smarter than this. - Yes, she is. She's just trying to find a way to get what she wants. It's not so bad. - I don't know anyone named Cassadrian, do you? - No. - I'll handle it. - Thank you. - OK. - Hey! - Hey! - All right. Hey, is there any word from Ian yet? - Yeah. He's on his way back. - When? - Any day now. - Any day? How non-committal is that? He's gonna be here for the show, right? - Yes. He will be here for the show. I gotta go check on some customs specs and then I got a meeting at the bank. - OK. - See you tonight? - All right. - Sophie, I've been getting calls from the press. Would you have time to go over the seating arrangements? - Wait! Sorry, sorry. Adam, Adam! - But they're calling me. I can't-- Adam! - Thank you. - Very appreciative. - See ya later. - Bye. For god sake! Hey! Who the hell are you and why have you been following me? - He's with me. - Agent Marks. FBI. - You want something? - No. - Two coffees. Thank you. - What is your relationship with Mr. Ian Jameson? He's our business partner and friend. - Is that all? - Why have you been stalking me? - Just wanted to see if you'd had any contact with Mr. Jameson. - And what did you see? - That you didn't... physically. - Does Ian have something to do with the body that was in the container? - This situation has become a little complicated and we thought you could help us clarify a few things. - Thank you. How about Mr. Jameson and your husband? How do they get along? - Like brothers, with the occasional rivalry. Men and their egos. But they make a good team. All 3 of us do. - Any conflicts? - We're partners with the demands of a growing business in a competitive industry. Of course there are conflicts, but there are resolutions. - Any reason to think otherwise? - We each have certain strengths and weaknesses. Don't you? - How involved are you in each other's sides of the company? - We consult and keep each other informed on the overall activities, but we each have clearly our day-to-day responsibilities and tasks. I mean, if we kept our hands in each other's work all the time, we'd never get anything done, would we? - Has your husband had any dealings with anyone new? - My husband handles our finances. He's constantly dealing with people I don't know. Look, we're both extremely busy. I don't keep tabs on every person my husband deals with while managing our accounts and balancing our books. Nor does he check to see which buttons I choose. We trust each other. - Do you know if your husband's heard from Mr. Jameson since their trip? - Why don't you ask my husband that? Do I need to call my lawyer? - No. - Then I'm free to go? - If you do come across anything else unexpected, it would be in the best interest of you and your family to give us a call. - Just be careful who you trust, Ms. Fyne. - Adam, we need to talk. Fine, but don't be home too late, all right? I'll see you there. Spencer... Come here. Sit with me. Please. Sit. I know I've been really hard on you the last few weeks. God knows you've given me reason. But... there's a lot going on with us right now. But I've had no right to take that frustration out on you. So I'm sorry. - There's this boy at school, Justin. We're always joking around and texting and... - And? - He asked Melanie to the end-of-the-year dance. - And Melanie is... - A model. - So you think if you model, that'll get Justin to ask you out? - Whatever. I don't know. - Your great-great- grandmother, Ella, used to clean Coco Chanel's studio at night. And she would pull the sketches out of the trash can and collect them. Eventually, Chanel caught on, so she started leaving her discarded sketches out on purpose in a nice, neat pile for her. And these were Ella's favourites. - I've heard that story, a hundred times. - Not this part. In France, at that time, once you were considered one thing, it was almost impossible to become something else. Ella wanted to be a designer, but she never had that choice. So when I became a designer, it was in part to honour my great-grandmother, but mostly, the choice was mine. That photo stunt you pulled, it showed your creativity... ...and a hell of a lot of chutzpah. And those are exceptional qualities at any age, impressively so at yours. So for the show, you can model. But it has to be a choice that you're making for you, not for Justin, or anybody else. And... But part of the deal, you have to start eating again. - Deal. - OK. Let me get that. Knocking on doors now, instead of hiding behind them? - Ms. Fyne. Sorry to bother you. May we come in? - Thank you. - Thank you. - So what time do you expect him home? - He should be here any minute. I-- I'm sorry. Why are you here? - The female "vic" from that container, name's Riyana Mingell. Any idea why we found your husband's DNA under her finger nails? - Hey! - And how did you get my clients' DNA without their knowledge or co-operation? - They sipped water and left their glasses. It's discarded genetic material. With reasonable doubt, we can do whatever. - Surreptitious sampling violates their constitutional right to privacy. - When people don't clean up after themselves, we do. I just happened to take a closer look at the garbage. - I can explain this. - No, Adam! - I can explain. I tripped. I fell backward onto a textile tool and it punctured me. Right here. She helped clean me up. That's probably why my DNA was under her finger nails. That's it. - Yeah? Prove it. - No. Look, he doesn't have to show you anything, OK? - I never took home-ec in school, but you obviously did. I just don't get how you'd sew your own label into the same fabric you used to kill her. - OK, you're out of line, Fincher. - She worked for us. That's it. I had no reason to kill her. And whoever did obviously did it shortly after she helped me. That's all. - Are you prepared to press charges? - There are witnesses to this? - About 35 very hard-working women at our dye factory in Marrakesh, near Riyana's village. - You gonna collect DNA from their garbage as well? - Either you're extremely clumsy or one hell of a liar. You can go, but not too far. - Listen, if they call you again, you don't talk to them, OK? You call me first. - Thank you. Thank you for your support in there. Thank you for believing me. - I'm just not sure what I believe right now with everything that's going on. We're trying so hard to do things in a new way, the right way, and this goes against everything we stand for. - There's gotta be some logical explanation. - There's nothing logical about this, Adam. Riyana's dead. You know the FBI came to see me earlier today too, asking questions about you and the company and Ian, and that's what I wanted to talk to you about. And then this happened. Like, just-- What is going on, Adam? - I don't know, Sophie, but I will figure this out. I promise you. I need more time. Trust me, I'm doing everything I possibly can to keep our family safe. - Safe from who? - Sophie... please. Trust me. - Why aren't you answering? - Listen, It's not important. Come on, let's... Let's go. - Endangering the very same women they're trying to help, as C.F.O. Adam Fyne remains the prime suspect in the death of one of their company's fair-trade workers. So with their inaugural fashion show and flagship store opening just 2 days away, will Fyne Designs be shutting their doors before they even open at all? - Alexa, can you please try to reach Mrs. Bashiri in Fez for me, please? - Of course. - The rice-paper price tickets arrived. - Is Adam here? - He stepped out for a few minutes. Said he'd be right back. - Thanks. - Excuse me. - Sophie, I have Mrs. Bashiri on line one. - Thank you. - Mrs. Bashiri, it's Sophie Fyne. Please extend our condolences to Riyana's family and let us know if there's anything that we can do. No, I just wish that Ian had mentioned that she was missing when he was there to talk to you about the dye lots. I'm sorry? He wasn't there? I'm sorry. I-- I have to go. - Hey! It's missing. Our container is missing. There was a document error. It was rerouted and now we cannot locate it. - Ian never went back to Fez. Why did you tell me he did? - I told you he'd try. Turns out he didn't have time, so he sent in his approval based on Mrs. Bashiri's opinion. Simple as that. - Why isn't he here now? - He's on his way back. - Is he walking back? - Sophie, come on. - Adam, Why do you have Ian's cell phone? - You all right? - You OK? You all right? - Yeah. - The guy's working on it. - OK. All right. - What happened? - I'm gonna check the main panel. - Wow. You're going to the hospital, all right? Come on. You're coming too. - Adam-- - Call 911. - Check to make sure no one else is hurt. - All right, behind the yellow line, please. - Thank you. Just stay back. - What are we gonna do? - What we're not gonna do is panic, all right? The press needs to know that everything is on schedule. We're opening as planned. - OK. - He seems OK. - Excuse me. - Spencer! Jerry. - Mrs. Fyne. You shouldn't be in here. It's dangerous. - So they think the explosion was caused by an electrical problem with the old wiring? - I've been a licensed electrician for over 26 years, and I can tell you there's nothing wrong with the wiring in this building. - Accidents can happen, right? - This was not an accident. - Jerry, I'm so sorry about your guys, but you know our situation. Is there any way that you can still get the store done in time for the opening? - Well, my team was lightened by 2... 2 of my best. Listen, the way that things are going in this city at the moment, I could get 2 more men. In fact, I could get you 10 more men. You know, they'd be hard-working and eager. - Great. - But I won't. - What? - I like you, Mrs. Fyne, but, none of us have been paid in weeks. So we won't be hammering anymore nails here, or hanging anymore sheetrock till we see some money. - Hello. -Ms. Fyne? This is Mrs. Lawson from Liberty Mutual. We can't seem to reach your husband and there seems to be a bit of a problem. - I-- I don't understand. - Company credit line is fully drawn, as well as the personal lines of credit in your name and Mr. Fyne's. - That can't be. The company line, I understand. We've had a lot of expenses. You have more credit cards than just the 2 with this institution. These are difficult times for everyone. Your situation isn't different from other people-- - Could you check our retirement funds? - I have. There's nothing there. - How is that possible? I see that all processed transactions included the 3 required signatures: yours, your husband's and Mr. Jameson's. May I see some of these documents, please? - I never signed that. I-- Or that. - But this is your signature? - Yeah. And your loft. You are aware that the bank has put a lien on it? A mortgage default, past 4 months. Strange. It seems an extremely large deposit was made into one of your accounts and then almost immediately withdrawn. - How large? - $2 million. - What? - The transaction happened too quickly to have been red-flagged. But an amount this substantial does warrant an investigation, especially if it's no longer there. - Where is it, Adam? Where's the damn money? - Ian took it. He took the whole thing. - What? - That's why he disappeared. He did the bank transactions online and he forged the originals, couriered them back and forth. And then he disappeared. I backtracked, went back to his hotel room, looking for him. All I found was his cell phone. That was it. I've had it ever since. - Doesn't make any sense. Why would Ian do that? - I don't know. - It's Cassadrian, isn't it? Armand Cassadrian, the man who helped Spencer in the park. The driver that tried to run her over, he had something to do with the blast in the store. He was with Cassadrian right after. Is this connected to Riyana's death? Is this-- Is Ian involved in this? - I don't know, Sophie. I don't know. - And the $2 million? - The $2 million, it was deposited and withdrawn in a blink. I don't know where it came from. I don't know where it went. - They're investigating. - I know. Lawson called me after she talked to you. - You should have told me. You should have told me. - Come on. Give me some good news, Phil. Please. - They got it. Eye-witness testimony backing your story. Investigation's being transferred to the local authorities. It's probably a domestic situation: husband mad at his wife for working or mad at the company for allowing women to be independent, what-- Anyway, everyone saw her help you and no one saw her get killed. - Great. Thanks Phil. - I know that's supposed to be comforting information, but it's not. - Sophie, we cannot save the entire world with one sewing job. You know, maybe we should just cancel the show, you know, delay the opening. - Hey, we have done nothing wrong, all right? We've worked too hard and come too far to just give up. The timing is crucial to the launch of the ad campaign. Listen, Ian took the money. You know what? It's replaceable. Opportunities like this aren't. We got one chance to make a first impression on the fashion world and make it an unforgettable. - With what? No merchandise. Our store is a wreck. We don't have any money to pay Jerry to fix it-- - Hey. OK, I'll rearrange for the second shipment to arrive by plane. With any luck, maybe it'll arrive today. Right? And the broker might be able to expedite clearance, get it to the warehouse by this afternoon. And then I could go to the bank and I can plead for some emergency bridge financing. And... - We're gonna make this work and we're gonna be OK. Don't shut me out again. Right? - OK. - Mom, have you seen my bag? - It's by to the couch where you-- - Where I left it. Are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - You're a great designer. And for the most part, you're a pretty decent mom, but you're not much of a liar. - And that's a bad thing? - Is everything all right with you and Dad? - You heard us arguing last night. - No. Kind of. Yeah. - We're fine. - I gotta go. - Bye. - Eating! Bye, Mom. - Drea. Hey, it's me. Yeah, I need a favour. - $200,000. Going once... going twice... And lot number 51 is sold for $200,000. Next on the block is a unique collection of original fashion sketches by Coco Chanel. Dating 1925 to 1932. Opening bid: $150,000. We have an offer of $150,000. Do we have an offer of $200,000? We have an offer of $200,000. Do we have an offer of $250,000? We have an offer of $250,000. Do we have an offer of $300,000? - OK. - We have an offer of $300,000. Do we have an offer of $350,000? We have an offer of $350,000. Do we have an offer of $400,000? $350,000, going once, going twice... And the Chanel collection of original sketches is sold for $350,000. - You didn't have to give up your book. We could have found another way. Not in time, we couldn't. I gotta go. I'll talk you later. - "Success is often achieved "by those who don't know that failure is inevitable." Coco Chanel. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - I called Claudio right after you called me. - Who was bidding against him? - Rufus Winthrop. He's often hired as a buyer's rep. I asked him to come to up Claudio's bid, which I could so lose my job over. - Thank you. I can't believe I sold it, Dre, and to him. - Please. Regardless of how much you dislike the man and everything he represents, the book is gonna be well taken care of. He's probably gonna build a shrine around it. And you got more than you hoped for and you need it. All right? - Yeah. - Listen, I gotta go if I'm gonna catch my flight. - Does that mean you won't be back for the opening? - I fly back that same night. I am just so sorry I'm not gonna be there to tell you how great it was and how proud I am of you. - Thank you for all your help. Thanks. - Johnny, I need a rivet here. - Did you see it? - I see it. I'd have to be blind to miss it. It's incredible, Soph. Hey, they've zeroed in on the shipment. I'll keep you posted. - That's great. Thanks. - I'll take 5. - So with all this attention, they can now show their audience what their innovative company stands for. Though, hard not to question if their dead fair-trade worker will overshadow any message they might want you to hear. - You know what? Call it good press or bad, the phone's ringing off the hook. Almost as many complaints as congratulations, but everyone wants tickets to tomorrow's opening. - Yeah, if there is an opening. - Did you ever have a chance to pick up the gold thread? - No, no. I got there too late. They were closed for vacation. - I'm sure we had some of that at some point. - You're right, we did. It must still be at the warehouse, right? - That's great. I'll go look for it right now. - I'll go. I think I remember where it might be. I need some air anyway. - Fyne Designs. Yeah, of course. Just one second. - Hey, Sophie. Guess what? It's in. The shipment as arrived. Alexa tells me you're down at warehouse? Well, the truck is waiting at the loading dock. - That is great news, Adam. - Yes, it is. I'll be right down. - I'm here. Just send some staff to meet me. We'll get it unloaded. Jerry could use your help at the store. - OK. Sure. I'll see you soon. Hey, we might just pull this off, right? - Yeah, we actually might. -Bye. - See ya. - Yes! All right. You gotta be kidding me. - Good. - That's it. She changed the order. - Dress rehearsal in 6 hours! - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? A little tired. - Nervous. - And you are one exceptional designer. Listen, I'm gonna head back to the store, help Jerry finish setting up, OK? - OK. - We're almost there. - Here we go. - Yeah, here we go. - You OK? Come over this way. All right! Take care of her. - I will. - Looking great, kiddo. Thanks. Mom... thanks. - You're gonna be great. - Hey! Thank you for coming out. See you. Thanks. Hey! - It's all right. - OK. ♪♪ You love me, baby ♪ You make me hot, baby ♪ I'll teach you, honey ♪ I can't get enough of you... ♪ - You know, for a patient man, my... my reserves are getting dangerously low. - Yeah. - You won't want to see me on empty. - Listen, I just need to get everything ready for tonight. I'll have-- I'll have everything all set-up for tomorrow, OK? - Not tomorrow. Now. - I can't now. - When I don't get what I want, when I'm supposed to get it, I just step in and I take it. And I will. ♪ You love me, baby ♪ You make me hot, baby ♪ I'll teach you, honey ♪ I can't get enough of you ♪ ♪ La la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ La la la ♪ La la la la la ♪ - No. - Wait, wait, wait. - Excuse me. Excuse me. How many of those containers did you open? - What? - At the warehouse. How many? - All of them. Where's Spencer? Have you seen Spencer? - I haven't seen her. - Where is Spencer? - She was just out there. I don't know where she is. You were supposed to keep an eye on her. -The much-anticipated inaugural fashion show and flagship store opening from designer Sophie Fyne, was not so fine as the events were marred by the possible abduction of her teenaged daughter, who modelled in tonight's show. Before the store could be locked down for investigation, cashes were already opened for business with purchases made by some very excite-- - Have a seat. - There still has been no contact with any demands for your daughter. Why don't we backtrack? Body in a shipping container, possible hit and run, the accident at the store. I don't think we can call this a string of bad luck anymore. - Look there has to be a common thread here that links these events to each other and to someone. - Mr. Fyne, if there's any pertinent information we might need to know to help us find your daughter, now would be a very good time to tell us. - No. There's, there's nothing I can think of. - The 3rd partner in your company, Mr. Ian Jameson. Any idea how we might be able to reach him? - Well, we actually haven't heard from him in over a week. - Should we change that to ex-business partner? Or how about ex-business partner with a score to settle? - He's still our partner. - Any other rogue partners we should know about? I can only imagine how you must feel like to have a member of your family put in this... situation. - Look, if she was taken by someone, it was for a reason. And that reason is worth more to them than your daughter. We'll be back shortly to set up. - Great. - The truth, Adam. Please. - Ian set up a drug deal with some very powerful and dangerous people. - Cassadrian. - Yeah. - What kind of drug deal? - A $20 million one. The $2 million in our bank account, it was an initial payment. Guess Ian must've withdrawn it right away. The drugs were supposed to arrive in a shipping crate. The one that you found in the warehouse. - There was nothing in that crate except the goods for the show and the store. - I know, but they don't know that. And now they think that I have the drugs. I don't have 'em. I swear to you, Sophie. I don't have the drugs. - That's why they took Spencer. - Yeah. Sophie, what we're doing here, it's a very expensive endeavour. All the travel expenses and the development work and... And these places, they're so corrupt. Our finances, they were in ruin. So Ian, he had an idea that we could make these sharp investments and we could time the market make the money back. I trusted him. It didn't work out. The losses started spiralling out of control, And then our debt was just mounting and mounting. And Ian was devastated. He had the deal with Cassadrian all worked out before I knew anything about it. I guess he thought that was, like, his one chance to replace all the money he'd lost. I don't know. But he got greedy and he demanded more money. They were furious... and they killed him. - How could you have let it to this point? How could you let it get this far? - 'Cause Cassadrian said that if I didn't carry on with the deal as originally planned, it wouldn't be me that he'd hurt next. - We are partners in business and in life. If you'd just come to me in the beginning, this would've never gotten this out of control, would never have gotten this far. And Spencer would never be-- That's it? Where's my daughter? - Sophie. - Where is my daughter? - Sophie! - Hello. Abandoned rail yard at the corner of Tonnelle Avenue and 91st in Jersey Hangar 2C. I'll be waiting. Come alone or fashion claims another victim. We'll be watching. First, set a trap... OK. - They wanna meet. - Where? - At our warehouse. - You shouldn't be doing this. - We tried to convince her that we could send an agent. - She's my child. I will take care of it. - Ms. Fyne, this is for you. - It's a GPS, in case there's a problem. We'll be right behind you. - OK. - OK. You sure about this? - No. If she was your daughter? - You better be damn careful. - You too. And thank you. - OK. - She's leaving the building. - Hello? Hello! - Mrs. Fyne. It is so nice to finally meet you. - I came alone, like you said. Now where's my daughter? - Right. Your daughter.. Lovely, little girl you have. - I did what you wanted. Let me see Spencer. - No, if you had done what I wanted, all this wouldn't have been necessary. Please, just let me see my daughter. And I will get you anything you want. - Really? Well, as soon as I get my shipment, you get your little girl. - What? I don't what you're talking about. What shipment? I don't understand. - She doesn't know anything. - Adam, what are you doing here? - I called him. I thought it was about time that we cleared the air. - She shouldn't be here. It's not about her. - No, Adam, you're the one who got her involved, because you're the one who backed out of our little deal? - What? What is he talking about? What deal? - Just let her leave. We'll work this out. - No, I'm not going anywhere without Spencer. - Sophie, Please! - I don't know what Ian has gotten us into here, but I'm not just gonna stand back and do nothing. - Well, tell her. 'Cause if you don't, I will. - It wasn't Ian. I lost all our money. And the deal with Cassadrian... Well, it wasn't Ian. It was me. I'm sorry. It was never suppose to go this far. I'm sorry. - How could you? - I was desperate. All right? I heard there was fast money to be made with Cassadrian I approached him. He offered me a deal. I took it. It's that simple. - I can't believe this. What was the deal, Adam? - It doesn't matter now. - What was it? - Heroin, Mrs. Fyne. Heroin. - Adam, why? - Everything is always so easy for you, isn't it? You're so talented. And Ian, whoa! Well, Ian, you know, he's resourceful, he's innovative. He's a real whiz kid, isn't he? And there's me. I'm the money guy. But guess what? I failed. I'm a failure. - OK, this is all very touching. Now let's just get to the part where I get what I want. - I wanna see Spencer. - You know, enough. I am through playing around. - You don't understand. I need to see Spencer. Then I'll show you. - Bring her in. - Mom! - Spencer! - Dad! - You know what I want. I'm not gonna ask again. OK. OK. Don't hurt her. - Daddy, I'm scared. - It's gonna be OK. Go see your mother. Go. - Are you all right? My god! - There it is. I'll take you to the rest. Just let them go. - You son of a-- It's been here the whole time. You know, we had a perfect deal... arranged between 2 mutually respectful business men. But you got a little greedy? Causing things to get a little... messy. You know that woman in the crate? Well... Tell her, Adam. I strangled her. - And why? - Because she saw me shoot Ian. He was gonna stop me and... it was too late. - That's enough! That's enough. I'm calling her right now. - Ian, please. Please, don't make me do this. - Let's face it, Adam. It's over. - No. Aw! - Well, and then we shipped her to you. That was just to remind you who you were dealing with. But you kept putting everyone around you at risk, people you supposedly care about. Then that $2 million deposit, that was just to let you know that we can give, then so quickly taketh away. Because when you play double or nothing, odds are you will end up with... ...nothing. - Are you done? - Now, let's go to the store. We've got some shopping to do. I almost forgot. Can't leave any loose threads now, can we? - No! - Freeze! Don't move! Federal agents! No, no, no. Stop, stop! - I got no gun. - FBI! Drop your weapon now! - Clear out! Move out! - It's OK. - Are you both OK? - It depends what you mean by OK. - Ian suspected Adam and contacted us a couple days before he was killed. We've been following Adam ever since, but we needed him to lead us to the dealers. - Let's go. - Excuse me. - Yeah, we're on it. Yes, sir. Closed captions: Vision Globale
