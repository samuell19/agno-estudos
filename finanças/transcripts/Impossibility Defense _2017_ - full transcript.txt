Even every acts with criminal intent if it's not possible to implement then it can't be judged as a crime. This kind of actions is called The Impossibility Defense. I really want he dies. I want to kill him. I can't let him live in this world. It will be better if he dies. Then just kill him. Kill him. Who's going to kill him? A man in a telephone booth. What's that? Haven't you heard of it? A telephone booth in a park write your reason and the contact details, then he will kill for you. I might ever hear of it. He's going to help you to kill someone, right? Yes. But ... But what? If the intention to kill is not pure The client's going to ... die. Get away from me. I'm definitely gonna kill you. I will kill you! The Impossibility Defense Hurry up, newcomer. Yes! I'll teach you how to interrogate, look carefully. Yes! Ah sorry, Inspector Tada. My name is Momose. I've been sent here for two weeks. I hope you call me by name. When it comes, I will naturally call you by name. I have my own rules. There's no way to compromise that. Excuse me. Is anyone there? Hello. Who are you? I'm Tada from Suginami North District Police Station. You must be Mr. Takumi, right? Yes. A woman hanged herself in an apartment at Park Temple. I'd like to ask you something. Do you know what happened to this woman? Damn it! Inspector Tada! Mr. Takumi, you're under arrest for obstruction. Newcomer! What time is this? Yes! 11:17 p.m the current criminal who obstructed official duties was arrested. Runaway means you admit it. Confess all of your sins and don't deny it! This beautiful woman will help you. Yes. If I don't get my money by tomorrow I don't know what my men are going to do. Are you scared? I'm asking you, are you scared? Yeah, yeah. If you're scared, and don't want to die, then my money should be ready. Have you ever imagined the end of your life? Divination? Get out of here. You should know about wasps' poison, right? Bastard! I'm going to kill you. These scenes the wasps love it best. Hello, it's Tada. Mr. Ueno was full of tricks. He was commissioned by Mr. Kijima Finance. Asked for the victim's account in order to defraud the insurance money. Pretend to commit suicide after killed someone. Mr. Kijima … Eh? He is dead? Hey, newcomer! I'm sorry. Inspector Tada, what is this? Don't you think these are all the dead leaves? You have worked hard. You have worked hard. You have worked hard. You have worked hard. According to the clerk's testimony After being poured a glass of water by a man in a black suit Mr. Kijima was suddenly falling down in pain. Did you just say a man in the black suit? Yes, what's the matter? Yes, wait a minute. It must be poison. Eh, no poison? He poured the water on the victim he didn't pour the water into the victim's glass. Including the swelling on the victim's body no toxicity was detected. The cause of the swelling on the victim's body is unknown. The cause of death is myocardial infarction. In fact, there was a similar incident in the port area three months ago. I'm stabbed. There was a woman who died on the street, claiming to have been stabbed by a man. But she didn't have any signs of being stabbed. And the cause of death was a myocardial infarction. There was a woman who saw a man in black suits. The woman who died was a suspect in several marriage frauds. I presume this man has something to do with this case. What about the evidence? I'm still not sure the suspect is the same person. Either way, it's not a crime. With a clear intent to kill. It's impossible to kill a person with something as simple as a spell. No matter what the outcome this kind of act can't be judged as a crime. It's indeed The Impossibility Defense. But this time, someone died. Whatever the outcome it's just water pipes, and it can't kill people. Impossibility defense is impossible to be judged. That's it. Mr. Kijima had a suddenly dead. Don't add unnecessary work. There's no evidence. The food delivery's here. Oh, Takeru. Thanks for your hard work, Inspector Tada. Just leave it there. Okay. I'll make tea. It's been a long time you haven't sent it by yourself. Yes, Mr. Sakurai has to leave early today. Then I came to deliver it. The man in the surveillance was so annoying. Newcomer! You are too loud! I'm sorry. Inspector Tada, my name is Momose. Did Mr. Ueno recruit all of them? There are some details of the conversation that needs further confirmation. Yeah, I got it. I'll leave it to you. You are going to write the report, too. Yes. Inspector Tada, you've worked hard. Ah, yeah. I'll take this back. Come to our shop. It's been very tasty lately. Say hello to the boss for me. Okay, thank you. He looks so handsome. Ah, He is Kawabata Takeru. I used to take care of him when I was in the juvenile delinquency department. Two years ago, he released from the juvenile prison. In the shop I introduced, he is a head chef now. A beautiful woman is really useful, right? Well, there's nothing wrong with that. He is very manly. Ah, Momoka. I'm back. Welcome back, Kenji. These are gifts for you. Ah, thank you. How's Fukuoka? Did you eat anything tasty? Not yet, I have no time. Did you change the aromatherapy? It smells pretty good. It smells like orchids. What do you think? That's nice. What's wrong? I saw Mr. Torimori was looking at us from the other side. Mr. Torimori? How can the president of the town council's peeping? I'm off. Off you go. Hey, Mr. Torimori. Those are our trash bag, right? I'm checking it out to see, is there anything weird inside or not. Today is combustible garbages collection day. Please obey society's rules. Please deliver what I said to your wife. I'm back. Momoka? What happened to you, Momoka? I'm sorry. I thought it was the wind. I opened the window to see I saw Mr. Torimori was there. Mr. Torimori? What did he do? Did he come in? Stop it! Do you know what you have done? I'll call the police. If you call the police I'm going to confess everything to the police. I'm going to say everything about your wife. Is that all right? If you still love your wife, save her. Momoka? Ken, I'll forget about it. Don't call the police, okay? Okay. [Urban Legend BBS] [A man in a telephone booth] Inspector Tada. The Kijima case and the former port district case I think the cause of death was a placebo effect. What did you say all of a sudden? What is the placebo effect? Well, it's just a delusion. I studied psychology when I was in college. I have relevant knowledge. It's very similar to this case. Like this one. About 60,000 Chinese and American troops died in the Vietnam War but half of them are not dead. What do you mean? Some had a shot in the arm or lost their fingers. This kind of injury wouldn't have killed them yet. But they think they're dead, and then they're dead. It's a hypnotic experiment. This man had heated a regular pen, but he told the experimenter it's an iron rod. And put it on the experimenter's arm. And the result was a bruise. So, in Mr. Kijima case someone let him think of water and the dead leaves as something else. The case in the port area made the victim think she was stabbed. It's the mind's control. Can you prove it in practice? You can't, right? Well. Is that you? If you could, please ... You have no other intentions, right? All I need is your pure intent to kill. His name is Torimori. Please kill him. Are you sure you want to kill him? Yes. I beg you. Are you looking for this? Thank you. What's up? Why are you staring at me? That cigarette was pretty good, right? Just one puff and you can go up to heaven. You're not one of them, are you? Are you all right? Drink that stuff. It’s because there are guys like you. His wife's going to ... Damn it. Thank you. These are the things that Mr. Torimori stole from your trash bag. You're going to work today, aren't you? But to celebrate getting rid of a dangerous person just forget about work and go home to rest instead. Your wife will be very happy. Everything is as you wish. Your husband is back. I'm sorry. Mr. Torimori saw me when I had taken drugs. September 18 Inside of Hakumoto's trash bag {\an8\fs39.884}I found Syringes {\an8\fs39.884}Should I report this to the police? Don't take drugs. He told me don't take drugs. When I cried you were just coming back [I was trying to persuade her, but she rejected] That's why I lied. Don't take drugs. I met these guys at the club. You've noticed that, haven't you? Right? Because it was exposed. I wouldn't have to try to get rid of the smell of my body. I've always wanted to meet you like this. Kenji, join us. Come on. No! No! My happiness ... don't take it away from me! How silly ... humans are. Thanks for your hard work. Thanks for your hard work. Inspector Akai. The man in the black suits was seen again. It was just before this started. The man who lived in the back of the house died at the nearby park. The cause of death was a heart attack. At that time, there were people at the park who saw a man in black suits. That's the man. Inspector Akai! There's a man in the black suits there. Inspector Akai, I will take him to the office. Go! I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. I'm sorry. Could you please go with us to the office? Yes, no problems. Your name is Usobuki Tadashi. But, it's not your real name, right? Yes. We investigated it there's no one who named by that name. There's something I'd like you to see. Near the scene of several deaths there were people who saw you. And today, too. What the hell is going on here? Could you explain it, please? I killed people. Is that okay? Or should I hang myself up? I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I .. ... didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. By the way ... there's a worm on your wrist. Got bitten? We need to disinfect it quickly. Inspector Akai! Then I'll go back. I was cooperating with the investigation. Can I go back now? You can go back. Thank you for your assistance. Inspector Yame ... is this really okay? If there is no evidence, we can't do anything. Because he volunteered to come with us. He always said he didn't do it. He said he didn't do it. Are you okay? I'm fine. Inspector Yame, your wrist. Was it true that nothing has been tested except an air? Her hands are swollen. So we did a lot of research. No poisons were detected. The case that excessive reality is not justifiable. That's the result. When that man said there was a worm on her wrist I saw nothing. But she seems to have seen the worm. Delusion can't be used as evidence. This is The Impossible Defense after all. That man said to hang himself up. And he said he didn't do it. Both of you were shaking at the moment. Did something happen? It happened several days ago. Inspector Yame caught a high school student at the illegal racing car. I saw it with my own eyes. It's impossible for you to get out here with that kind of reasons. You must have mistaken it. Please call my dad. Your dad was also saying "I hope he confesses his guilt honestly" You are lying. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. That boy killed himself in custody. I didn't do it. That boy was Inspector Katsumura's son. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Well, thanks for your hard work. But he didn't blame Inspector Yame at all. That man used some methods to find out about it. It has shaken Inspector Yame's heart. Shaking the chaotic state of mind and body will strengthen the delusions. Yes. How's your wrist? What have you done to me? I just helped you do what you wanted. What's the purpose? In order to purify human beings. You are a fragile person. Tormented by guilt. Got caught up in your own delusions. "I was not wrong" "I was not wrong" You are gonna ... die tonight. I was not wrong. I was not wrong. I was not wrong. I didn't do it. It hurts. No. I didn't do it. No! I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Inspector Yame usually uses her right-hand. If she's going to kill herself she should hold the razor with her right-hand to cut the left-hand wrist. But she actually cuts the right wrist. Was the place she cut really what she wanted to cut? But no bleeding happened. And she didn't come out of the bathtub. I don't know yet if it's suicide or not. The water melted the blood and it looks like several times the amount of bleeding. She saw how her own blood had melted in the water. There were also many cases of people losing consciousness. It's another delusion again. The body sank in the water. Further testing will lead to the cause of death. But I think it most likely she was drowning. This is what's going to happen. It's not suicide. Absolutely not. Good job. It’s a pity, her death was very good. That woman relying on the honor of her quasi-professional group and always looked down on me. Because she was a chosen person. She underestimates others. There was such a consciousness. That's why she said to my son "Your dad told me, he hopes you confess your guilt honestly." She told a lie. That filthy woman was framed by her companions. That's exhilarating. Your intentions were also filthy. Not pure. There's no pure way of killing people. Furthermore, I pretend I don't know anything. I just asked you to kill her. You said it carelessly. Eh? Mr. Katsumura. You're the one who killed her. Mr. Matsumura That's a lie, right? You entrusted that man. I was not wrong. I was not wrong. Hello. So cute. Come in, please. The 60-minute service costs 22,000 yen. Here you go. I take the money. Thank you. I'm sorry. Please give me a minute to pick up the call. [Notifiations off] Hello. Yeah, yeah, it's me. Yes. Got it. I'll be there. Kimura Yu? Just let me listen to your commission. Yumehara Risa. She is my sister. But ... My parents divorced when I was ten years old. Risa followed my mother. I followed my father. And we are alienated each other. There were lots of things happened after that. Dad lost his job because of his debt. I had to sell my body to pay it off. Your sister was raised by your mother with great care. She's a popular jewelry designer now. And the president of the big hospital introduced a doctor who matched with her. She's going to get married next month, right? Recently I found her in the news on the Internet by accident. I wrote a letter and say it's great to be a jewelry designer. And then I wrote about the engagement. Some congratulatory words and my current situation were also truthfully written on the letter. But ... there was no reply. I think there must be some kind of mistakes. I went to her jewelry store. Sister. She noticed me. But she completely avoided me. Look at these eyes. She should think of me as a filthy woman who sells her own body. It feels like the two of us completely live in a different world. If at that time ... I followed my mother's words nothing like this would ever happen. This woman is the only one who's happy on her own. Think of me as someone who never exists. I will never forgive her! I beg you. Kill her man! I'm already out of the store now. I'm going to the meeting hall. Okay. Yumehara Risa. Who are you? Nice to meet you. I will scream. Someone who closest to you wants your life. What? Gasoline? The man who's with you before, he looks so handsome, right? That's what that newcomer said about you. A newcomer? Yeah, a newcomer. His name is Momose Asao. But he still a newcomer. Next time, be sure to bring him with you. That's only waste his time. Because he's a jerk who likes noodles best. Oh yeah, he's a frequent guest at Koto-ku's ramen house. But, it looks like ramen in there is delicious, right? Ah, I guess. This is from the boss. It looks delicious. Thank you boss, I'll eat it. Please enjoy your meal. Anyway, you also already become supreme. Seriously, I was a terrible person before. If I hadn't been caught by you, I'm sure I couldn't do this kind of job right now. Here it comes again. He was proud of his own bad past. It's not like that. I'm not proud of it. It went too far. Instead of it, I don't know how to be proud. That's right. Anyway, you cried and scolding me at that time. You used all your might to turn my tampers. Your expression at that time was really unforgettable. [Up to 14 people were injured] That's a big deal. [A big explosion bomb in the park was a hand made] Today, around 4:00 this afternoon. There was a huge explosion in Shirakawa Park, Koto-ku, Tokyo. It seems it was a hand-made bomb. It's very similar to the shrine bombing that took place in Mitaka City last December. [The police are investigating on the basis of a similar point in these two cases] A terrorist attack? This kind of thing will continue forever. Probably. But we will never give up. Are you okay? Wait, don't touch me. Sure enough. Who are you messing around with, murderer! Occasionally, there will be people like you. I can't take control of people like you with an uncharted territory there are human beings that can't be controlled. You might be able to kill me. Kill you? What is your purpose? What's this? I want to know. The human's weakness and strength. Which side is the real gesture of human beings? Did you kill people just for that kind of experiment? I didn't kill anyone. I'm longing for the darkness. How could it be like that? It's for someone who wants to fall into the dark. So ... you don't have to save anyone. Anyway, you couldn't save anyone. Shut up! Whoever says it I'm going to save people as much as I can. You, too ... I will definitely stop you. Then make sure to use your own hands to kill me and end my life. There's no other way to stop me. If you did well in that awareness come to my place. Shit! Although it's just a small injury it's better to be in the hospital for a precision examination. It's your fiance's hospital, just take it easy. Yes. So ... before the accident the man that you have talked with in the parking lot was it this man? Yes, it's that man. What did he talk about? He said that someone who closest to me wants my life. And then the brakes went off while I was driving. It must be that man who has something to do with the brakes. But ... the brakes didn't go off. And there was no gasoline on the steering wheel. Katsuhaki. Why don't you believe me? If I rely on the law it's impossible to catch that man. I have to kill him. What are you talking about, Inspector Tada? It would be only me who can do it. What do you mean? That man's mind control doesn't work on me. Eh? Several days ago, when I met him he said so. He attacked me with a toy knife. But it was just a toy for me. I've never heard of it. Because I've never said it. Yes. Maybe it's the same theory. Same theory? What's that? For people with the same underlying thinking patterns it's very difficult to grasp each other's psychological flaws. You mean I'm the same kind of person as that man? A murderer like him? No. It's just ... It's just a hypothesis. But ... Why did he fail this time? Ms. Yumehara is still alive, right? Excuse me. Here is your lunch. Thank you. Nishi Saeko. He always talking about you all the time. He said you're very good. Lisa, stop it. Help me! Touku! Help me! Anybody there? Are you okay? What happened? Over there. That man was right there. I just saw him over there. Risa, are you okay? Poison! No poison! Newcomer, look clearly! Okay! Get out! No one allowed to enter this room. Get out! That's the same thing. Please hurry and stop me. What do you want to do to Ms. Yumehara? I'm not gonna do anything. She was ... Wasn't it you, who hinted her? It was you who couldn't stop me. Shut up! Well. Kill me, and I'll be shut up forever. Sure enough, he fell in love with that woman. I don't think I got in your way. Stop it. Somebody call a doctor. If I didn't kill him I'm going to be killed. Believe me. Believe me. Believe me. Risa? It worked? I'm so happy. I'm looking forward to her life from now on. Thank you very much. One more thing. Yes? Risa wants to give you something. It's already at your doorstep. Yes. Oh, okay. Because something really nice happened. So I will give you a special service. Hello? Do you think that's enough? What the hell! Is it wrong? As a way of human existence. What are you talking about? Hey! Hey! Violence is the worst. Stop it. What's your problem, you bastard! It hurts. Stop it! Let go of me! Why would you do something like that? Why don't you be gentle to her? Yu, thanks for the letter. I'm the only one who's having a safe life. I'm really sorry. When you came to the store I knew it was you, but I ran away. I couldn't immediately accept you, because I haven't prepared myself yet. I'm sorry. If you don't like your current job If you want can you come to work at my shop? I will contact you again. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. Sister! I'm sorry. How silly ... humans are It's a pity. Your sister, Ms. Kimura Yu committed suicide. There's a message on your confiscated phone. Sister I'm sorry. I'm so envious of you. So I asked someone to kill your fiance. I'm sorry. Good bye. Yu ... You were wrong. Katsuhaki, he has a relationship with another woman. He has been cheating all the time. When I said I wanted you to work at my shop he was very angry. He said never ask a kind of person to attend our wedding or something. How good it would be if you didn't die because of that kind of person. From now on, she's going to get a psychiatric diagnosis. This one you don't need it, right? Ms. Yumehara. Ms. Yumehara? Are you all right? Looks like you're tired. Well, why don't you take a little rest? Ms. Yumehara, let's go to bed. Momose it nice he's saved. Yeah. Messing around of human life in the palm of his hand. Unforgivable. That man, too. That man. There's no way to catch him. Sure enough, I have to kill him. Hey, you can't kill him. Even if you want to kill him, you are going to be controlled by his mind. I'm not under his control. Say it. When he attacked Inspector Yame you didn't see anything, right? Yeah. So ... If it's me, I can kill him. Kill him or something. That kind of thing must be wrong. But ... if I don't do anything wrong I can't stop that man. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Because I'm a cop. I'll figure something out about that man. Don't overthink of Yu's death. You have to live. Don't give up halfway. Okay. Inspector Wakamatsu. Inspector Tada, get in and drive. What on earth do you want to do? In order to inherit Yu's feelings. Go to that murderer's place. Don't tell her where that man is. If that the case, he's going to die. Stop it! I know where that man is. I just need to take his card name. Take it quickly. This. That man gave this to me. It seems Inspector Tada is calling for help. Come on, back up. Get the car ready. Okay! There are lots of people who are coming. I'm going to kill you now. Kill that man with this. You're the only one who can kill him, right? Do you have to kill me in that way? Those are very well polished genuine goods. Kill him. You're the only one who can stop me. Hey ... don't you want to save him? Come on. No. It's wrong! It's not supposed to be like this. It sucks. I'm disappointed. I'm sorry. You can't kill me. I know. Tell the police this man killed me. Yu's and my feelings it's up to you to inherit it. She's quite capable. She's much better than you. Inspector Tada. Don't do that. Wakamatsu. Wakamatsu. Wakamatsu! You bastard! Wakamatsu, that's a pity. Momose doesn't seem to have regained consciousness yet. It can only be maintained in a dangerous state. That man wasn't going to answer the question. He just said one thing. Inspector Tada knows everything. He killed Yumehara Risa, right? There's no something wrong about that, right? What are you hesitating about? It's a great opportunity to catch him up. And we can take revenge for Inspector Yame. Can I meet him? Have you testified for me? I want to see your face first. She's Yumehara Risa, isn't she? Shouldn't she be handcuffed? She was able doing something like that. Which means you unlocked her handcuffs, didn't you? That's terrible. It wouldn't have happened if you didn't get the handcuffs off. Your kindness to her killed one of your men. Your kindness was only to make yourself feel better. It's hard to accept, but it's masturbation. Oh, or what? You were learning me. You want to let Yumehara Risa falls into darkness. We are really the same kind of people. You used her for that kind of masturbation. At least let yourself follow Yumehara Risa's dream. Hey! This man didn't kill Yumehara Risa. Yumehara Risa wiped her own neck. She gave me a knife to kill this man. Newcomer. Wake up. Please. Inspector Tada. How's Momose? Maybe he'll wake up soon. You haven't eaten anything yet, right? I made you this. It's better to eat and take a bit of rest. Thank you. There's no security on this floor. Just take a rest. I've added powerful sleeping pills to your bento and tea. Don't move! If you make any moves, lots of people will die. What are you talking about? That time, you cried for me you have a face that says you believe in hope. I'd love to see how that face looks really desperate. It's a lie, right? I've been lying to you about my attitude from that time until now. You believe me more and more. The more I look forward to today's moment. It's beautiful when it's destroyed. I'm sure you'll let me see a beautiful expression of yours. Those phones are connected to the bomb button. The blue one is the room downstairs, Momose's room. The red one is the kindergarten over there. That's a lie, right? It's only your tricks to play with me, right? The big explosion at the shrine last year. And the recent explosion in the park. And then the big explosion at the ramen shop. I did all of that. You can't introduce me to regular customers without bombing them. That's all for today's experiment. Today's explosion will pretty impressive. Starting with the convenience store in the middle of those two buildings. Here we go. It's beautiful. Don't ever do something like that again! Inspector Tada. Thank you for believing me. I believe and being betrayed by you. I believe and being betrayed by you again. I'll remember this cycle until I die. I'm so glad. You still believe me. I believe you. Then I'm not going to stop. So which one do you choose? The operation is very simple. Just click on the one you want to blow up. And then boom. Takeru ... I will never ... Boom! I told you, don't move. The bomb that controlled by my phone is going to blow, too. Kill your partner? Or kill the kids? You have 10 minutes to decide. If you don't choose after 10 minutes I will blow all of them. Come on. Which one? What are you doing here? It's not your turn to play. Do you know him? Yeah. The one who asked him to kill Mr. Kijima was me. Because I didn't have money to make bombs I borrowed money from him. But I didn't have a plan to pay it back. So I asked the volunteer killer. I asked him to help me clean up my mess. But this man is so boring. Killing one man, it just dawdling. If you want to kill it should be done splendidly. Have you ever been hit by five-inch nails? Someone commissioned me to kill you. Who commissioned you? It was his senior. That guy entered the shop a long time after me. But he became a chef before me. I'm so sick of him, he's a criminal. So ... Stop it! He should live to atone for his sins. Inspector Tada. Kill me if you want to save him. Get ready for atonement. I'm sorry. The bombs will automatically explode in 10 minutes. Do you have time to save them? It must be a lie. What the hell is going to happen do you think? Sure enough, that's a great look on your face. Inspector Akai! Contact Lark Kindergarten and General Hospital quickly. Someone planted the bombs there. Please contact the bomb disposal unit. It's going to explode in about six minutes. Inspector Tada. It was a lie. According to police notice a bomb was found in the hospital. Run away from the hospital immediately. Please pay attention to the instructor. Now, evacuation training begins. Follow the teacher. Next, let the kids die. Your bomb ... Do you see it? It's at your place. Very impressive. You ... Have you ever imagined the end of your life? Yes, I have. It's over. Congratulations. Hell is waiting for you. I will write a report when I'm back to the office. You are wake up. Is this a dream? There is a beautiful woman in front of me. It's not a dream. Inspector Momose ... Welcome back! It seems you have lots of spirits. You too ... The wound is healed already? Yeah. It's a pity that you didn't intend to kill me. When will you kill me? When will I kill you ... when I really want to kill you, I will kill you. And I will lead more people to the dark side again. I won't give up either. So, you are not going to kill me. Your rule doesn't work. I have my own rules. I will use hope to kill you. Use hope? How silly ... humans are. Do you know a man in the phone booth? I've heard of it. Leave a message in the phone booth then he will kill the person you want to kill. The target will get weird and die. And if the person who commissioned him, has no pure intention, that person will die. He is like a demon. Maybe he is an angel. It's said that the devil is actually an angel. I also want to kill someone. Please, kill that person for me.

It's all part of the way It's all part in the road that makes you cry or laugh? It's too late to pray to the god Right or left which one do you choose?
