[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] JOHNNY: Come on, Eddie, they're right there! Call back-up. We'll take 'em and put the hammer down. Not yet, I wanna see where they go. Just stay right there. Then they're gonna see us and then they're gonna take off, and then we're gonna have to chase 'em, and we both know how you like car chases, Eddie. Look, just shut up and keep your eye on the road, okay? Come on, we're gonna lose 'em! Move! Come on, get in the other lane![HONKS] They're getting away, move it! If we would've busted them when I said... Look, shut up, you talk too much. If you just keep your eyes on the road instead of sounding off so much, we'd be fine. Come on, man! All right, look, Eddie, I know a shortcut. There's no shortcut through here! There is a shortcut right here, I bet you my life on it. Watch it! Come on, man! Look out, there's one right here. [SIGHS] Jesus Christ, kid. Everyone's entitled to one mistake. You did that the day you joined the police department. Come on. Get stuffed, Eddie. All right, my man, I hope you left the door open. Tommy!Come on, homeboys. My guns are in there, let's go! Shanna's starting to show, Chet. Dumb bitch wants to get married. To you? [LAUGHING] Did you talk to her yet, Harry? Later today. Yeah, well, I want it back. Make sure she understands that. But no rough stuff like last time, okay? Who, me? You're standing around? You're getting paid to stand around? Move! All right, give me a butt shot of these babes right here, just like that in full... Smile, I'm paying you! All right, come on, come on! Come on, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. Come on over here. Stay right there. All right, come on, come on! Come on. Yeah, yeah. All right, come on over here. That's great, that's great. Hey! Hey, hey, get the... [SHOUTING] Go, go, go! [WOMAN SCREAMS] Come on, Johnny.We got em, Eddie. We got the bastards. Watch it, watch it, watch it! Were we rolling? Did we get that on film? Is the camera... Tell me the camera is safe. [SIREN BLARING] [GUNSHOTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] Come on, Johnny.We got 'em, Eddie. We got the bastards. Watch it, watch it, watch it! Jesus Christ! Next time, I drive. Eddie, if you drove, we'd never get there. Hold it steady, I'm gonna shoot his tires out. [GUNSHOTS] Stop it! Stop the damn car! Stop it! Jesus! [SIRENS BLARING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] Oh, no, I don't wanna see this. Harry! Harry Itus! Where are you? This is costing me money! [WOMAN SCREAMING] Okay, Agnes, okay! I couldn't find Shanna, so I came back here to look for her and she was just lying there. Get out, Agnes. Get out, get out. Jesus. It's that damn gang. She looks like Swiss cheese. I'm Detective Sergeant Van Owen, and this is my partner, Detective Marks. Oh. [STAMMERING] Hi. I'm glad you guys could make it. Hey, I come here to make a tasteful music video and end up in the middle of World War III! JOHNNY: Yeah, well, up until yesterday this used to be home to a gang called the Central Avenue Blades. They've been having a turf war with a rival gang. Yeah, well, those gang guys are terrorists and you guys should be out stopping them! Is there anything you can tell us about the victim? CHESTER: Shanna?Mmm. No, I just met her last week. I don't even know her last name. JOHNNY: Is there any reason you can think of as to why someone would want to kill her? CHESTER: Are you kidding? Those gang guys did. They're trying to shake me down! They should be locked up! You called, Chet?Yeah. Well, excuse me. Harry Itus, the yo-yo. How's it going, Har?Hey. Good. Good to see you, Eddie. Still doing a little dope, are you, Har? No, no. I don't do that no more.EDDIE: Mmm-hmm. What you doing then, Har? I'm working with Chet on the video.Yeah. Yeah, sure. Seen anything suspicious lately, Har? No. No, no. Uh, I'll keep my eyes open for you. All right, and don't leave town. I think I'm gonna wanna talk to you a little more later. I'm gonna need a list of everybody involved in the production. Huh? What? Are you out of your mind? This is Hollywood. These people have unlisted numbers. Does this look like a joke to you? This is a murder investigation, where's the list? [STAMMERING] I got... I got a... [CLEARING THROAT] I got a list right here. All right. [SIGHS] And don't touch the body. This is a murder investigation, thank you. [EXHALES] Harry, are you out of your mind? I told you to scare her, nothing more. I swear to God, I... I... It wasn't me. I didn't even talk to her! That's the very same thing you said last time, which is bullshit! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Don't mess with me! Chet, I'm telling the truth. I swear to God. Oh, you are a giant sack of horse shit! Now, you get over to her apartment, and you find it before the cops do, capisce? Yeah. Who's Harry? Harry Itus, AKA Harryitis. Sounds like a disease.He is a disease. He's a juicehead, a dope addict, a general bum. Used to go around to high schools, wowing kids with his yo-yo tricks and selling 'em dope on the side. He's a nice guy. Then he became a soft-core film star. Listen to this, they say he got his limp doing it on a trapeze with some broad, but who knows what, you know? Sounds like a major stud to me. No, I don't know about that, but, anyway, uh... There's something about this reminds me of a case I worked two years ago. Remind me to call Vice. That producer guy was awful anxious to blame those gangs. One of the prime suspects. The girl probably got hit by a stray bullet. We gotta go pick up Tommy Chow. By the way, did you see that hook in there, near the wall? Yeah, what about it? Well, there was blood on it, that's all. So what? Well, it's just strange. It reminds me of that case. Here we go. Gina Angelo, 3414 Central. Who's Gina Angelo? It's Tommy Chow's girl and I'll bet you that's where he is right now. Time to put the hammer down. Let's go, kid! Okay. [GINA MOANING] [TOMMY PANTING] [MOANING LOUDLY] [BOTH PANTING] [WHISPERS] I think I love you. Come on, let's do it one more time. You sex maniac! What did you do, kill somebody? Me? Come on, let's do it. Come on, give me a break. It's all you ever wanna do. [INDISTINCT MURMURING] That's 'cause I'm nothing but a sex toy to you. [LAUGHING] And I've got the key to your ignition right here. [LAUGHING]So let me turn you on... Ow! [CRIES OUT] It was an accident. Why'd you have to hit me? Come on. Hit me. Come on, hit me. Don't do it, Thomas. I swear I'm gonna... [BOTH GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] [EXCLAIMS] [PANTING] You're mine. You belong to me. [WHISPERS] Say it. Thomas, you're hurting me. Say it![GASPS] I belong to you. [GINA MOANING] [MOANING CONTINUES] See? What did I tell you? I'll take this door, you go around the back, okay? Don't take any chances. This guy's a killer. Me? Take chances? No way. And how come I'm always the back door man? 'Cause I'm too old for that crap. [MOUTHING] [GINA SCREAMS]Police! Freeze! Don't move! Don't move, motherfucker! Get down, down, down! [GASPS] All right? Don't move, man. All right? You got him?JOHNNY: Yeah, yes. Don't move, man. Let's see what we got here. Hey, you got a search warrant? Looks like a key. You're going down, pal. You are going down! [YELLS][GRUNTING] Down, man.[ALL GRUNTING] Get him! JOHNNY: He's gone. Way to go, Detective. We almost had him. Lousy cops, you'll never catch him. I'm taking you down to the station and booking you. And you're coming down nice and quietly, okay? Take it easy, Eddie. [CHUCKLING] She can't go down there like that. Why not? Tommy got away because of her. And what were you doing? What were you thinking? Just let her put her clothes on, Eddie. Why? So she can pull a gun on us like her killer boyfriend? Think! He's not a killer. No, when someone shoots, he shoots back! And you love him, huh? You hear this? What? Do you turn tricks for him, so he can buy his crack? Go to hell! It's not like that. I have a job. I'm a real dancer. What do you do? Dance in the crack house? No! Eddie... Here, come here, let me take your cuffs off. Put this on. Put this on your shoulders. [MEEKLY] Thanks. [QUIETLY] You really wanna book her? Absolutely not. She's much more valuable to us on the street. We use her as bait. You see? Huh? Huh?Huh? What? The guy, he likes her, he's coming back. I don't know, it sounded to me like he was raping her. She loved every minute of it, that's how it sounded to me. Look, just forget it, kid, all right? What? What? You're not her type at all. You're much too sensitive. She's into cave men. If you want her, you've gotta beat her, trash her. That's bull!No, that's... Oh, Jesus, kid. You're gonna have to learn this the hard way, all right? We stage a little argument. Then you persuade me to let her go. Then you go in, you turn on the charm. Get the information. Who knows? Maybe in the middle of the night... [SCATTING] One thing comes out, another... You find out where Tommy's hiding out, you get it? All right. [LOUDLY] No, I'm not letting her go, we're booking her. It was my fault, Eddie. You really got a job? Honest to God. Okay, I'll be personally responsible for her. I'll put her on probation. That means you gotta call me every day, so that I know you're not messing up. For how long? Until I say you don't have to. We can go to jail.That's okay, that's okay. I'll... I'll call you. Okay, Eddie? You're gonna keep her out of trouble? All right. I think you're crazy, but all right. And, you... Stay away from Tommy, he's bad news. Just stay away. I'll be in the car. Okay, here's my card. My number's on the back. I want you to call me every day, and leave a message on my machine. And if I'm not there, I want you to leave a number where I can reach you. 'Cause I might wanna talk to you. Okay? Capisce,Gina Angelo? Angelo. Angelo. You Italian or Mex? It's none of your business. What? A little of both. Okay. Thanks.Stay good. [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Those yo-yos down there... So what's going on? You and her going on a date? Hey! I think she likes you, kid. You wanna book her? We can go back in. It's okay, Eddie. I think you got the hots for her, huh? If you ask me, you just wave some cash in front of her face and you got her. I'm not asking you, Eddie. You'll learn the hard way. Look, as soon as we get to the station, I want you to run down those names. Start with the men, all right? What names? The names we got from that jerk-off producer. Okay. [ENGINE STARTING] Hey. You guys clear out of here. I got business. Where'd you get it? Heard the Diablos got ripped off the other night, lost a couple of pounds. Is this it? No. This stuff's dope. It's from a new connection. Somebody from the Westside, you know. He's a new man in town. 'Cause if this is it, then I'm buying my own stuff back. The Diablos ripped me off before they got hit. You believe that? People going around, ripping each other off, and then selling it back to each other? All them junkies out there? [SCOFFS] They're going crazy. Let me have a look. Hey. Is this all? There's more. I just wanna make a deal first and then I'll get the rest. Just need a place to hang for a while. Chill out. You know what I mean. Okay, Tommy. You can chill out here for a while. I'll cut you a deal. [SLAPPING HANDS] Yeah. Tommy ain't gonna believe this. [EXCLAIMS]Excuse me. Hi. Well, come on. I'm Gina, the new dancer. Cory told me about you. You need to find Agnes Price. She's in charge of our make-up and wardrobe. She'll show you where to change, and give you a costume. Okay, thanks.Sure. Hmm. You know, Erica was lying. She and Shanna were like that. You sure you didn't miss it at Shanna's? Wasn't in the liquor cabinet, was it, Harry? She knows where it is. I tore the place apart. You want me to talk to Erica? Oh, you gotta be kidding, Harry. I didn't do Shanna. Chet, I swear.[SCOFFS] Yeah, sure. Well, I'll talk to Erica, okay? [SCOFFS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who is it, please? I'm still changing. Sorry, honey, can I come in? Agnes Price, wardrobe and make-up. Oh, yeah, sure. First off, see this changing room? Change your clothes behind here. You got that sleazoid Harry Itus up on the catwalk, spying on the girls. Terrific. You're about the same size as Shanna. Poor baby.Who's Shanna? She's the girl who was killed in that gang fight yesterday. May she rest in peace. What happened to your neck? An accident. What's that? Oh, this? My grandmother gave it to me. It's pretty, let me see. I don't know what it is, but it's old. And it brings me good luck. That's Saint Agnes. Patron saint of youth. My namesake. That makes us sisters in the eyes of God. I don't know about God and I don't want to, okay? All I know is this brings me good luck, that's all. I bet your grandmother thought it was more than a good luck charm when she gave it to you. God is strong and He can help you if you ask him to. I'm sorry if I offended you. That's okay, honey, I love the Lord. He's helped me, and I just like to help everybody else. You'd wanna get out there, they're waiting for you. And I'll touch you up on stage. Thanks. So excited! [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] All right, that's good. Stay good, go on. Stay good. Okay, what do you got?Oh, that's Khalif. He used to run with the Diablos till I got him for possession, now he talks to me. Word is that the Diablos were hit for a couple of pounds, most likely by our friend Tommy. All right. Well, what I've got here is that Shanna Robbins moved in here about eight months ago. No trouble paying rent, had visitors, mostly men, but one guy was here a lot, Chester Cummings. The neighbor says that she identified him, and says that they had been arguing a lot lately. Shanna wanted to get married. And the report was right, someone ripped her place apart last night, looking for something. And he said he didn't know her. Must've been awful hard to want to marry a creep like that. According to the coroner's report, she was three months pregnant. Chet was the father, or at least she thought he was. She was trying to stick him for child support. And you think he'd kill her over something like that? I mean, what about the apartment? I don't for sure, but I got a hunch. Let's get something to eat and I'll call my buddy at Vice. Okay, good. All right, let's go.

All I know is what I told you yesterday. I can't believe you're working over there. You belong to me. And you're working over there for them? No way. You get out of there, Gina. You get out of there right now. Tommy, I can't! This producer... If I do a good job, he's going to get me more work! Tommy, this could be my big break. Big break? Maybe this producer likes you, huh? Well, maybe I should go over there and blow his fucking head off. You know, the cops should have busted you for what you did. So why aren't you in the joint? You drop a dime or what? Tommy, I swear it's not like that. Tommy, please don't... Don't do anything... Do you believe this? I believe the lady was murdered and that we have a suspect. That's what I believe. Well, it says here that she died of multiple stab wounds, and that's not Tommy. Read on. The report also says there was a set of prints on that knife belonging to Tommy Chow. Yeah, but, the Blades kept their stuff in that warehouse. Anyone could have picked up that knife. But they didn't. Any other prints in the room? Just the people that were supposed to be there. Uh, Agnes Price, the make-up girl. Cummings, and of course, our main man, Harry Itus. Go check him out. Listen to this. I talked to my buddy at Vice, and a couple of years ago, Chester Cummings produced some soft-core porn films, starring Shanna, that other dancer Erica and Harry Itus. It was some bondage thing, they were all chained up, there were flaming torches. Everything burned down, they left the girl for dead. Chester Cummings skipped out. That's the story. What do you mean? This is what we heard on the street. There was no evidence, no body and no film, so what do we have? Nothing. We have a pregnant murder victim who was making a snuff film with her producer boyfriend who now claims he hardly knew her. That's what we have. The place was torn apart. Somebody was looking for something important. A film maybe? I don't know. Look, let's go talk to that other dancer broad, Erica. Maybe she knows something. And remember we still have to pick up Tommy. You hungry?Mmm.

We'll go find him. But first call 911 and get some back-up. That's what we need. Go on. Okay, okay. Johnny, take the other side, where the garbage is, all right? Use your flashlight. Be careful. I'll take this side. [LINE RINGING] Hello? Answer the phone! [SQUEAKING] Erica? [PEOPLE MURMURING DISTANTLY] [SQUEAKING] Erica, is that you? [SQUEAKING CONTINUES] [CLATTERING] [GASPS] Tommy! Shh. So the only one that's missing is Erica. [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING] [GRUNTING] Why do you do this to me? [GASPS] Put that down.Out of the way. I'll pop her. [SAFETY CLICKS ON] Just put the gun down, Tommy. What do you think you're gonna do here? If I can't have her, nobody does. [SOFTLY] Right? [YELLS] Right? [SCREAMING] [SQUEAKING] [GRUNTS] [SOBBING] [GUNSHOTS] EDDIE: Damn it! Let's go get him. You ruined your glasses. You go. I'll be right here, all right? Thank you. It's multiple stab wounds. Just like the last one. Thank you. Where's Gina? Gina? Hey, you guys. You really screwed up, didn't you? Don't you think Tommy's out there ready to slash some other girl? You think he did it? No. I mean, Tommy wanted to teach me a lesson, but he wouldn't have done that. Erica... Erica borrowed my robe, and I just went back to the dressing room to get my medal. And then this guy scared me. So you saw the killer? I saw a guy with a black hat and a long, dark robe, and... And he was holding these chains, and his face was kind of messed up. Messed up? Yeah, like it was burnt or something. He was walking funny.Like with a limp, maybe? A limp? I don't know. I don't know. You guys still looking for Harry Itus? He's the only one with the keys to the power room. I had to bust the damn lock to get the power back on. Now, he... I think he's up in his office. But, I mean, the door's locked and he won't answer it. He's probably drunk. I'll go talk to him. Maybe we can get to the bottom of this. Look, she sounds like she didn't see much at all, but get a full report anyway, will you? Thank you. Harry? Harry, Detective Van Owen. Open up, Harry. CHESTER: Harry, don't you hear me knocking? All right, Harry. Have it your way, we're coming in. Didn't you hear me knock?Wait a second. Hold on. Don't touch anything. Don't move. Harry's dead. Tell the coroner to hold on, we got another body. A big one. Damn, that thing was his life. Yeah, looks like it was his death, too. Any idea who might have done this? Oh, come on. He's a lying scumbag. It could have been anybody. Yeah? Did he ever lie to you? Oh, no, come on. What are you getting at? Well, you were seeing Shanna Robbins for the last year, weren't you? So what? So you told us you didn't even know her last name. Did you know she was pregnant when she died? What is this? 60 Minutesor something? Hey, listen, man, I wanna talk to my lawyer. You can talk to your lawyer downtown, I'm taking you in for questioning. Come on.Yeah? On what charge? On suspicion of murdering Harry Itus. What? You think I did those girls, too? Come on.Hey, seriously, man, you're crazy. You got nothing on me. Where you going? Home, okay? You're crazy. You think Tommy's going to leave you alone? Damn it. He had a gun pointed at your head. Listen, you don't know anything about Tommy and me, okay? All you guys, you all want exactly the same thing as he does, except he's more honest about it. I'll be fine, okay? [GRUNTING] Let her go, kid. Let her go. Did you get a statement? Yeah.Isn't she something else, man? [CHUCKLES]You lay one... [GAGS]Come on, let him go. Hey, Dick Tracy, huh? How much you wanna bet that I make it with her before you do? [LAUGHING] A limp? Cummings doesn't have a limp. He walks fine, I saw him. No, Lieutenant, the other guy, Harry Itus. He had a limp. Our witness said the killer had a limp. We think Itus killed the girls, and Cummings killed Itus. Why? Because, sir, Cummings just wanted Itus to scare the girls. He didn't want them dead. See, we have proof he knocked one of them up, and we believe she was trying to blackmail him with a sex film he made. He wanted it back. Wait a minute. This is the same hardcore film report that was going around Vice a couple of years ago. It's the same damn crapola. Well, I don't think it's crapola, sir. I'll decide that. In the meantime, think about this. Cummings' attorney is downstairs, screaming his head off about false arrest. And unless we come up with something else, I'm going to have to release Mr. Cummings. And I'm going to have to apologize. And you both know how I love to do that. Now, is Cummings the only suspect you have? There's Tommy Chow. Tommy Chow? What the hell have you guys been doing out there? Snorting or what? Twice you had this Tommy Chow character and twice he got away. His prints were on both murder weapons. Yeah. Yeah, it's here. Well, that's good enough for me. Bring him in. But it doesn't make any sense. Those girls were all cut up. Tommy is a gangbanger, not a psycho. There's no motive. Look, you're saying you got a suspect, but no motive. Now, I'm saying bring the man in. And we'll damn well find a motive. Now, get out there and shake tail, while I go over the rest of this stuff.[SIGHS LOUDLY] Yes, sir. [SIGHS] [LINE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? You got it? Got it right here, Trip. Yeah. I'm gonna come by for a visit, okay? No, not here. I'll meet you in the alley, behind the factory at 51st and Vernon. In about an hour. Factory at 51st. Yeah.You got it. So how do you know he's gonna show up here? Trust me, he ain't through with her yet. You think he did it? Sure. He murdered an innocent dancer. What?Look, I don't believe it, but the Lieutenant says it's Tommy, so it's Tommy, you know? Look, the story on the street is that the other night, a couple of pounds got ripped off from one Julius J. Jackson. You heard of him?Yeah. Known on the street as Triple "J" or just plain Trip to his friends. And you think Tommy did it? No, the Diablos did it. And then Tommy hit the Diablos. Exactly. And that brings us to that gym bag he's always carrying around. Right. I was wondering about that. That's good. [SIGHS] Maybe he and Harry were working together. After today, he's gonna wanna get scarce for a while, get out of town and that takes cash. I put all my money on him trying to unload that stuff tonight, and with his balls, he's probably trying to do it right back to Trip. So when he shows up later, we're gonna follow him for a while, okay? If we can get him and Trip, we'll be famous, pictures in the newspapers, 11:00 news, everything we want. Think Gina's involved? What's with you, kid? You falling for her? You're in big trouble. She's just looking for a way out of the barrio. I heard you, okay? Forget it. Look, you got to find yourself a nice woman who can put up with a lot of crap. Duck, duck, duck. Here they are. Stay with the car, homes. You see anyone coming, you don't worry. Got it? You got it, dude. Let's do it. Well, look at that. He even has his own key. Oh, sorry. Up yours. You want to take him? Keep down. He's got a lookout in the car. [SCREAMS] You scared me. What do you want? You. Look, I got to get out of town. And I want you to come with me. [VOICE SHAKING] I... I don't think I wanna go with you. You'll never have to work again. I'm gonna take care of you. I like what I do! I'll... I'll buy you a studio. Tonight... Tonight I'm gonna make more money than you've ever seen before. You can dance all the time. I wanna dance for me. I wanna dance for me! I don't wanna have to go to you for money. I want my own. [SCOFFS] You want your own money? Mine isn't good enough for you? What's wrong with mine, huh? Or maybe that producer, he's gonna make you a big star. I told him exactly the same thing I told you. I just want to dance. "Oh, I just want to dance." "I just want to dance."[SCREAMS] He's hurting her! [GROANS] Not yet. Not ready. Tommy, please. You're gonna dance for just one guy, Gina. And that's me. Get it? Just for me. Just for me! No, Tommy. [LAUGHING] [HORN HONKING] Diablos! Go! Go! Go! [TIRES SCREECHING] Let's go! Let's go! Hey, they've got Gina. Cover me! Oh, fuck... Come on, let's go! [TIRES SCREECHING] That car wasn't in too good shape to begin with, and now it's even worse, and it won't go far. What the hell? Down there. See it? An empty street, so what? Put your glasses on. Big cloud of exhaust. I know they're in there somewhere. Let's go. My glasses are on, I don't see anything. What is it? He's around here somewhere. If I'm not back in five minutes, get the hell out of here. I know Tommy hid it in here somewhere when I wasn't looking. You don't know either, huh? Maybe he don't like you no more. I like you. You like me? Stay away from me. Stay away from me. My man, Trip, how's it going? [GRUNTS]All right, Tommy. Where is it? I got it... [GRUNTS] I got it stashed. What do you think? I'm stupid? No, you're not stupid. But are you smart like me? Turn around and take a look. Friend of mine. Used to be in Special Forces. He knows all kinds of tricks. Get out. Now put your hands on your head and move it. Let's move, Eddie. No, not yet, not yet. Wait, until he's holding the stuff. If he's not holding it, doesn't stick. TRIP: Got it? Think you're real smart, huh? Maybe your girlfriend can help. You like my friend here? Maybe help him out, huh? [LAUGHS][EXCLAIMS] Get up on the roof? Come on, I can get him if we get a little closer. [GRUNTING] All right, I got the guy on the roof. [MEN GRUNTING] [GROANING] Okay, okay, okay. Where is it? It's in the backseat. So pull it out. You throw it out.[GRUNTS] There it is, bro. Let me make sure. [SHOUTING] He's getting away! Get this guy! Let's get this guy. Okay. Okay. [YELLING] Which way did they go? He's down there. He could be in any one of those buildings. We'll have to check 'em one by one. Let's go. [GROANING] [PANTING] You've lost a lot of blood. Face it, girl. He ain't gonna make it. Tommy... He always said he wanted to go out like this. He didn't wanna die in no jail or nothing. GINA: Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Tommy, please. One thing he said, he said, "Ramon, "take care of Gina for me." And that's what I'm gonna do, girl. I'm gonna take care of you. He ain't dead yet! He might as well be. Come on. Got to get out of here. Forget it. I'm not going without him. You listen to me now. And I say we go, so we go. ...feel good. [GINA SCREAMING] [PANTING] You're not going to be nice to me, either? [GUNSHOT] [INDISTINCT YELLING] [GINA SCREAMS] Look who's here. Okay. Throw your guns where I can see 'em. Come on out with your hands up or she dies. Just lead. He's gotta shoot that thing with both hands. [EDDIE WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Now come on out where I can see you. I don't want to miss. I don't want to miss. [YELLS] [SCREAMS] Damn it! Come on.Mmm. Let's go. There's nothing more you can do here. Come on. Let's go. Come on, kid, let's go talk to the Lieutenant. Okay. Gina, I'll be right back, okay?Here. She dropped this inside. [GROANS] I told you guys to shake tail, not blow up the town. What the hell happened? Back there, you'll find well-known drug dealer Julius Jackson and two of his friends. When the deal went bad, we stepped in, broke it up, and the rest is history. Tommy, the girl and Ramon Vasquez hid in there. Where are they now? The girl's over there. Tommy and Ramon are dead. Well, bring her in and book her. He abducted her against her will, sir. You got that right, now? You're sure? Well, we staked the place out. We watched it go down. How sure can we be? Okay, okay. Give me a full report in the morning. What do you got there, Eddie? It's just a scratch, Lieutenant. Well, I'll drive you to the hospital. Come on. Oh, and uh... Congratulations. Two cases in one day. JOHNNY: Two cases, sir?Yeah, those dancers. JOHNNY: Sir, that case is not closed. Look, you got Tommy Chow. You got Tommy Chow. The case is closed. You know what I mean? Closed. But, Lieutenant, there is no proof. Why don't you go home Mr. Marks? Lose a couple of days. Come on, Eddie. Let's take care of that scratch of yours. My medal. Oh, yeah. Eddie found it. He meant to give it to you. [SIGHS] Thanks. Couldn't stand to lose it. You wanna... Maybe come up for a beer or something? Sure. I'd love to. I never knew my parents. My grandmother's the one that raised me. She gave me this. It's all I've got left to remember her by. Tommy just appeared one day. Started sleeping on the porch. And Grandma used to chase him away every morning with a broom. And then this bum attacked me. And he was there to fight him off. After that he could sleep pretty much anywhere. And when my grandmother died, well, I felt protected. [VOICE CRACKING] It was my family. I wanna get out of this place. I do it through dancing. He did it through violence. He saved your life tonight. Listen, Johnny. Tommy didn't shoot Ramon to save me. He did it because I was his property. He never let me forget that he owned me. Ever. Can you hold me, please? Of course. [WHISPERS] Of course. [SNIFFLING] You smell good. My shirt's two days old. [CHUCKLES] [INHALES] You smell safe. I have to get ready. Okay. I'll be watching. Um, I do want to go out with you again, though. Sounds good.Okay. Tonight.Okay. All right. Make sure you wear the same shirt. Uh, yeah. All right, yeah. Good. I will. Your wish is my command. That's, uh, good. Okay, good, good, good. All right, bag it. All right, get that two 2K in there and flood that thing out completely. All right. All right. Check the gate camera. A and B, reload. Hey, Gina! Gina. Hey. Come here. Hey, you look terrific. I heard the bad news. Sorry about Tommy. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. I bet you're feeling better, huh? Yeah, just great. Hey, come on. Where's that smile? Show some enthusiasm. We got a lot of work to do today. And tonight we're gonna celebrate. I can't tonight. I have plans. Hey, Gina. Gina, listen. Tonight I'm meeting this choreographer. He's really big and you should meet him. He works everywhere. Las Vegas and Atlantic City and Tokyo. Really? Really? You should meet this guy. You could really be somebody in this business.Okay. And he could really help you.Okay. All right?Yeah, thanks, Chet. Okay.Thanks. Perfect. All right. Reload! AGNES: It's only me, honey. [SIGHS] This is your big day. Nervous? Just a little. What happened to your costume? Looks like someone took a razor to it. It was a knife. It slit. Good thing you weren't wearing it. I can take care of it. I'm gonna need some extra strong thread for that. Hold on a second. I have to get a bag down. Are you okay? Give me that. "Mary Ann Vincent. "Producer, Chester Cummings." Well, it's probably one of Chester's screen tests, not important. Here. Hold still while I take care of this. CHESTER: Hey, Gina! Anybody seen Gina? We are ready to go. Somebody find her. AGNES: Two minutes, Chet. Heard about those gangbangers. Bet you're relieved. I'd rather not think about it right now. I'd rather focus on my dancing. Hmm, that's a good idea. There. All done. They're waiting for you. Thanks. My eyes are leaking. Let me fix that. Okay. Okay. So it was a great day and I saved some money, but you gotta find me two guys that'll work for half that much. Okay? So do it. Hey, Gina, baby. Okay, now this is your moment to shine. Like a star. Like gold. Like me. And the camera's going to be on you, and only you. On the best and only the best. So give it all you got. Go bonsai, baby. Thanks, Chet. Hell. [INHALES DEEPLY] Let's just rehearse this and shoot it, okay? MAN: Okay. This is a rehearsal. Everyone, quiet, please. Quiet!

I'm right here. Nothing's gonna happen to you. All right? Just in case, I want you to hang on to this, okay? [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] [GUNFIRE] They got a match on Agnes's prints. Before she was Agnes, she was Mary Ann Vincent, aspiring actress. She made a sex film with Chet and Harry. Shanna and Erica were in it, too. There was a fire. Chet just let the camera keep running. He thought she was dead. He killed them?Yeah. Plastic surgery gave her a new face. She found religion. But she could never forget what they had done to her. Somehow she got a print of Chet's film and was driving him nuts with it. She framed Tommy by using his knives to kill Shanna and Erica. Poor Agnes. Yeah. [SIREN WAILING] Why don't you get out of here? I'll get one of the guys to take you home. I gotta stay here a while and clean things up. I don't want anyone else to take me home. Just you, okay? I just lost a big part of my family, too. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING]
