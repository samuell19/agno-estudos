Today, hardly anyone is happy. But those who were bestowed heart are all unhappy. A RIDICULOUS GENTLEMAN I need a lift. Do you hear me? A patient heading to operation! Damn, who's messing with the lift? Lie still! No troublemaking! One floor lower and we're in the operating theatre. Seems like a heavy downpour is coming. I hate getting soaked by the rain. The operation on his heart which he hadn't even wanted was, unfortunately, successful. When he again opened his eyes, he realized he wasn't rid of anything he was trying to escape. Damn, can't you stop messing with the lift? It's stuck again! It's all due to women from the kitchen. They call a lift, open the door and talk. Cows! He was better, although he wasn't striving to get well. On the contrary, he almost wished to get worse. Don't rush, engineer. It's not a job paid by the meter. I know, I know. I wanted... I tried... just a few steps. Don't worry. You're getting back into shape. "Slowly but without stopping," as an old lady said. What? I'm sorry. You haven't sent anyone a postcard. Do you want me to buy some? To make your folks aware you're still alive. Who? Well, you should know who to write to. If it depended on me, the post office could be canceled. Well, let's change the subject. Want to hear of my case? 30 yrs of immense happiness. And last month on Wednesday 16th I return from work and my wife is gone with all her belongings. Even the electric stove was taken away. Can you imagine? Quite dreadful! What? Is it possible to buy binoculars anywhere nearby? I mean, any sort of binoculars. You can't walk about with a fever. Why didn't you tell me about your fever? So, how is our doctor today? The struggle against death involved him after all. He tried to convince himself a healthy body was enough to live. Whenever his tired brain went numb, he almost started to believe it. Hello! - Hello! Hello! Try to smile. Your picture will appear in the papers. It's already appeared. Even the minister has arrived! Am I supposed to sing an anthem? You see, I told you Mr. Simek is funny. He's such a big joker. He can even whistle like a bird. Right? Not now Mr. Simek, please. Do you happen to know the name of a street where is situated the house with a green cupola? Visible from here. Lie quietly. Do you need a pillow? Julie, hand it over. What's up? After leaving a hospital, you can enlist in a sports club. Breathe steadily. The point is to breathe steadily. Whoever fails to do so, leaves by the back doors. Never walk without a stick or upstairs. Not a single stair! Otherwise, the yo-yo inside you is going to break. Come to the window, please. Does he swallow the pills? - Yes. - But only if they taste good, huh? He keeps fooling you. We don't medicate you for fun. Here there's nothing to fear. This is not a prison. Do you hear me? Yes, yes. Up. Down. Once again up. And down. Perfect! - Bravo! Congratulations! Thank you. This is my colleague. Excellent! I can recall you taught at The Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. I didn't. You did. I can still remember your lectures about cybernetics. My name is Harmach. I attended your seminar. Yes, yes. Do you happen to know the name of the street where the girl stands on the roof? Don't raise your head! Watch under your feet! No talking! Shut up! Do you remember Whitman's probability theory? I mean, the six basic rules. - Quiet! How are you proceeding with the textbook? I'm thinking over a third chapter. Man, do you still believe we'll ever hold a pen again? And have a white sheet of paper? How long did the operation last? - Nearly six hours. How many people participated in the operation? The whole team. It means ten doctors. Was it the first operation of this kind in our country? - Yes, it was. Do you expect to perform more similar operations at your clinic? We do. But there must be a suitable patient, of course. Professor, how do you feel? It was reported you were completely rehabilitated. Will you resume lecturing at the faculty? I don't know. Comrade minister, will the professor's department be restored? Of course, it will. You'll resume teaching for sure, Simek. There are no impediments. Gentlemen, now you can follow me to visit the operating theatre. My teacher was flabbergasted. She couldn't grasp I was able to count it. Why does she think so little of me? Couldn't I solve it on my own too? I'm sure, you could solve it as well. Do you want me to call your ex-wife? Maybe she'd like to come. - No, thanks. Have a rest! You should take more rest. Helena! C'mon. Calm down. Hello! Hello! Did you sleep? A bit. Not at all? - I did a bit. You didn't call the staff at night. Weren't you thirsty? - I'm not that thirty anymore. What's this? Try to throw it out of this window. But in such a way it will land without hitting any wall. Is it difficult? - Just try it. You're right, it isn't easy. Isn't there a dove? Sometimes I can see it. - No, there isn't one. It has a golden ring on its feet. You never stop joking. - I'm serious. You've no fever. Swallow and wash it down! So, it's true. You are doing this! Right now! Professor Preclik said if you avoid taking this you'll die. Do you mean Professor Prattle? It's not funny. Stop joking like this. But what if I don't want to join any sports club? - What? He's a wretch and she's filthy. She only does a big laundry before Easter. Can you believe it? - No. - Well, yes! He comes from work and there's nothing on the stove. Did you notice how he looks lately? He's ready for the grave. - Mhm. I'm only curious when he gets fed up. He should pack and say goodbye. I'll get a stroke. Man, you weren't supposed to go on a trip. What are you looking at? There's no girls' school in sight. May I? Your binoculars are exactly like mine. They are yours, actually. She always used to appear in the morning at eight and in the afternoon around four. In any case by half past four. She must release them again. They can't be kept locked up. Lie still. He has a high fever. - He hadn't before. He had! But you lack something. If you proceed with such neglect, expect to be transferred to a garden store. For your recovery we need your cooperation, my dear. Maybe some nurse can take a look from the window next to the lift. - Look at what? If the pigeons were released. Jeez, give the pigeons a break! And he's not to leave the room. Bring in a "gramophone". No "gramophone", please. What's wrong with music? Such terrible scribbling! You drive me crazy. What's your result? 12 thousand 8 hundred. You forgot the decimal point. I must leave, or I'll go crazy. She's hysterical. The result? Twelve point eight. One point twenty-eight. Right. Now, listen! You'll go to the lift, huh? Opposite the lift, there is a window. You'll look out straight ahead towards the green cupola. And then you'll tell me if you saw a girl releasing the pigeons there, okay? There's washed laundry on that roof. Why does she release them? After you come back, I'll play the tune again. But you'll have to push the hand back. I can push it back several times, if you want. Okay. What are you doing here? Don't you have homework? He sent me to take a look if any pigeons are flying around. Where are they supposed to fly? - Around the green cupola. Go home, hurry up! I left my notebook with the old codger. - How dare you? I'll pick the notebook up myself. And don't forget to buy milk and bread. Turn over, please. If you start choking, just beep. I won't choke. - I'll bring you some tea. Will the boy come back? - No, I sent him shopping. Lie quietly! There were no pigeons. Don't worry. Do you want a radio? No. Please? Yes. Nurse, I'm worried about something. What's up? Should I call the professor? - No, no, no. Can you go along the corridor, up to the lift, and there... open the window... - Don't give me anything. I've no fever. I'm not so feverish to talk nonsense. Please, take it. So, what about the window? Look straight ahead and in this direction about three blocks away, there's a house with a... flat green roof. There's also a high green cupola. You can't miss it. Just, please, take a look, if some laundry is hanging there. The girl who hung it... maybe something happened. The pigeons weren't released for two days. Ah, so. It's started to rain, huh? Yes, but... - Maybe everything is okay. Maybe just... she was busy and collected the laundry later, or... is doing it now. Please, can you take a look? Preclik. Zezulova. What's up? Professor Simek still has a fever and he called me... shh... You wanted to be kept informed, so... - So, what did he want? He called me to take a look at... - Pigeons? No. At the laundry... if there is still... it started to rain. And did you do it? - The laundry is there. O my God, woman, didn't it ever rain on your laundry? Listen, Zemankova... - I'm Zezulova. Okay, Zezulova, don't tell him anything. Or... tell him the laundry was brought in. Jeez, I dragged him out of the coffin and he'll go crazy instead. Tell him the laundry was brought in, otherwise he won't sleep again. And in his tea, dissolve Noxyron, two tablets. Pour a bit less tea in his glass so he'll drink it all, huh? Keep an eye on him. And... call me before midnight. Okay. Did it rain all morning? It was a heavy downpour. In Davle, the sewers couldn't take it and a grocery store was flooded. Listen, friend! No talk about pigeons! Who's blocking the lift, damn it? Listen! No. I can't take any money. Well, thanks. What is the street called out there? Next to the cupola. Do you see the green cupola? Let me think. Next to the cupola? - Yes. It might be Melichova street. Yes, Melichova. Professor Simek. Jindrich Simek. Am I calling the police dept. Of Prague's 1st district? Damn, hurry up! From the hospital. Yes, in the New Town district. Professor Simek calling. Yes, I'm the doctor here. Pardon? Which ward? Internal medicine. Please, in Melichova street... Hurry up! Melichova. But I'm not completely sure because I'm only looking out of the window and... I noticed on the roof of that house... It's a house... with a sheet metal roof. So, you're an intern now?! You'll drive me crazy. Last six months I sleep less than you. My dear! Were you born in the countryside? - No. Have you lived in the countryside? - No. Did you used to go to the countryside? I'm not crazy. Call the two ladies who work in the kitchen! Look, these two ladies are on the roof almost daily. If it doesn't rain. - Of course. Did you see any flocks of pigeons flying round in circles? - A single flock. Me no. - I'm not sure. If any pigeons fly over the roofs here daily, you'd have to notice, right? We'd notice but we didn't. In Melichova street and around there's no registered holders of pigeons. Prague's Breeders Association is granting no new concessions to keep pigeons. So, where is the washing? If she took in the laundry, why doesn't she release the pigeons? Remember, if you keep refusing food, we'll feed you through a gastric tube. Six months ago we saved your life, so don't hurry to pass away now. What are you reading? This will only excite your mind. Bring a TV set to his room, a radio, all kinds of magazines and never leave him alone. Be there day and night. Lift yourself! I'll have my breakfast. It's better not to oppose them, I tell you. You can't outsmart them. If they stuck the tube down my throat, I'd puke. It must be disgusting. HISTORICAL LANDMARK OF CZECHOSLOVAK SURGERY Damn, it's a Jan Hus wannabe again. Well, it's his heart defect. You didn't submit your application. I did. - Nobody carried anything to post. I gave it... to the son of Mrs... - Proke?ov?? I called the faculty. They didn't receive anything. Do you want to resume your post or not? No need to apply anymore. I spoke with the dean, Mr. Absolon. He'll arrange everything. In spring you can be reinstated. Actually, Mr. Absolon said you know each other. Yes, Mr. Absolon knows me. Don't you like him? We haven't met for 15 years. Last time I saw him was at the trial. But Mr. Absolon wasn't arrested? No, he wasn't. Light on, please! He asked, if you finished the textbook on cybernetics. Yes, I did. So, will you return to the uni? Can you give me back the book? Up to the heavens, please! You'd have to take a carriage and leave by the back doors then. But on the way they'll drop you down a few times. Better get well. Do you mean the gate behind the church? Yes, it's for the last sacraments. Nothing. Of course. His hearts beats like a bell but he has pigeons in the belfry. And it drives me crazy too. Ruzena, hand me over his medical record. There should be also the detailed statement from court. Do you know what? I might have seen pigeons flying around here actually. Mind your own business. Do you have a uni degree? - You don't. If there's any trouble they'll blame us. What's the reason for the ongoing fever? Get some sleep now. Turn the radio off. And lower the window blind. If you need anything, just beep. DO NOT SPIT ON THE FLOOR What's your name? Alena. What's wrong with you? - I don't know. I've brought you a ruler, a mirror and a book. Can you teach me to fold the same paper bird as you do? I'm in a hurry. Do you have a sheet of paper? Girls, a sheet of paper, quick! Commander! Jindrich Simek, enemy of the people, reports arrival. How long were you married for? But... I am married, Commander. You're not, Simek, any more. Your wife's divorced you. By law even the most serious criminals should be informed about family news. Any more questions? No. Leave now, Simek! I want to hear you rush downstairs. Why don't you put up a tent right there! Bye, girls! Hello! Please, where is a tram stop? Which one? Please, where is a tram stop? Go round the corner and then turn right. Are you okay, doctor? He's "oiled" like a roller bearing. In broad daylight. Doctors are boozers. Tickets! Tickets, please. Anyone need a ticket? Please, do you know where Melichova street is? No, I'm not local. Do you know where Melichova street is? - Go to the marketplace and then turn left. How can I reach the marketplace? - Second street on the right. - Thanks. Sorry. Where can I take you? To Melichova street, please. - Do you mean, here in the Old Town or in Dejvice? There are two Melichova streets. In the Old Town. You can reach it faster by walking then. Take me there, please. Okay. Cool chicks, huh? Where in Melichova should I stop? - Stop somewhere... near the big house with a cupola. There's no cupola in Melichova. - How come? I don't know. I mean, a huge green cupola. Well, it might be the savings bank then. But it's in Potocni street. So, take me to Potocni street, okay? - Fine. Going to the savings bank, huh? - No, but... Actually, yes, to the savings bank. The savings bank is right here. This castle with a cupola. Yes, but I'm looking for another building. Here somewhere? - Yes. Maybe... no, keep the change. - Thanks. Do you have kids? - I do. Two. At home. Another two "abroad". And do you happen to know the house number? No, I just remember the shape of the roof. Can we go someplace to view the panorama? Then let's go to what used to be the Stalin statue pedestal. Do you see it? No. Don't you see the building with a green cupola? I do. But it isn't Melichova street, it's... It's Zakostelni street. Actually, it isn't even Zakostelni. Let me think... It must be Frantiskanska street. Or something like... What's the matter with the building? - Well, something happened there. Can you take me there? How do you know something happened there? - Can we go there, please? I've booked a ride soon. No, you paid already. - Just take it! I don't need money. You're on the run? So, let's go. Sit on the front seat, though. What's your name? - Eva. How old are you? - I'm fifteen. Are you looking for someone? No, I'm not. Thanks. We don't use a lift downstairs. Excuse me... Do you happen to know... if anyone breeds pigeons around here? I don't know. Mom, I know about the pigeons. In this house some lady has pigeons. Vera, c'mon! What is her name? DON'T HANG LAUNDRY ON THE ROOF! IT CAUSES DAMAGE! APARTMENT ADMINISTRATION I beg your pardon. Is there someone in this apartment... - I don't know any tenants. Damn, what's up? Anything on fire? I'm looking for... in this apartment... some lady or... miss who... That's why you woke me up after a night shift? Dude, you've had enough! And it's only noon. Did next door have a party again, huh? - No. I'm worried something happened to her. If you mean the slut from the third floor, then it did happen. A month ago! She studies. Don't go. If you touch the doorbell again, I'll beat all the booze out of you. Rather save bucks for your funeral, Romeo. Hallo! Hallo! Are you looking for someone? I'm looking for a certain girl. Every day she was releasing... pigeons on your roof. Rudolf? - Yes, Jirinka, I heard him. Do you feel sick? No, I'm okay. Do you know her? Who is breeding pigeons here, Rudolf? It must be the new one. Which one? Who is new here? Oh, I already told you, Jirinka? About the divorced man. He brought a girl from the countryside. Yes, yes, you told me. She sold a house and Mr. Danes bought a car. Does she own pigeons? Did you speak to her, Rudolf, huh? - She didn't mention it, Jirinka. She's getting childish! But, I guess, he... left. Mr. Danes, I mean. He went somewhere by car. Three or four days ago, I'd say. Where does he live, please? - Here. But you can hardly stay on your feet. What's up? What's going on? What happened? - Open the door! She's not dead. Are you a doctor? No, I'm not. Please, call an ambulance. Call a doctor! Call the ambulance! Why me? Your flat is close. Yours as well. But you can explain. - I know as much as you do. Has anyone a phone? Who has a phone? The ambulance just arrived! Two ambulances. Can anyone bring a towel and water? Rudolf, bring a washing bowl, a towel and soap for the doctor. ATTIC Exitus. Look. It's true, a dove keeps coming on the window sill. He really wrote it. Why did he rip out the pages? His daughter? Maybe. When he was sentenced, she repudiated him, didn't she? She was seventeen. Those times seemed groundbreaking. What did you do at seventeen? When she figured out the truth, she did the same thing as the girl today. However, she died. Unfortunately, they were decent people. But her suicide truly broke him. It was something irreversible. O my God. He would have forgiven her. She was just as stupid as anyone of us. What was her name? I don't remember. THE END
