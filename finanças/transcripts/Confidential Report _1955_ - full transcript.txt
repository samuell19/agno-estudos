Investigation of this case reached into the highest circles... and the scandal was very nearly responsible... for the fall of at least one European government. This motion picture is a fictionalized reconstruction... of the events leading up to the appearance last Christmas morning... of the empty plane. Here I am, at the end of the road ‒ Naples, France, Spain, Mexico... and now Munich - Sebastianplatz 16. In the attic of this house lives Jakob Zouk... a petty racketeer, a jailbird... and the last man alive, besides me... who knows the whole truth about Gregory Arkadin. My confidential report is complete now. My original fee for this job was $15,000... and it looks like a little bonus will be tossed in ‒ like a knife in my back. But Zouk will get his first, unless I can save him. Yeah, and then me... the world's prize sucker. Jakob Zouk! Jakob Zouk? Jakob Zouk? I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to talk to me. We've gotta get out of here. Look, if we don't start moving, you're gonna be killed. I mean that ‒ murdered! I'm a dying man with no money. Somebody wants to kill me? - He's wasting his time. - No money, huh? How would you like to earn 500 marks? Huh? And who are you, Santa Claus? I'm the one that's gonna keep you from getting murdered. If I can save your life, I can save mine. We've got to stick together. - Who are you? - My name is Van Stratten. The first time I heard the name Arkadin was in Naples. That man, Bracco, told it to my girl, Mily. - Mily? Who are these people? - Mily was my girlfriend. And Bracco gave us two names and a way of getting rich. Well, why should this Bracco do you a favor if he didn't know you before? I don't know. Maybe he had some kind of sympathy for me. He was dying. Oh, I'm dying, but I got no sympathy for you whatsoever. I don't like you either... but I have to save your life. I'll tell you why. It all began one night in the harbor at Naples. Who is this man? You know we can't afford any trouble. - Go get a doctor, quick. - Too late for a doctor. - But the police! - Try to keep them away. I don't want to spend my last few minutes with a lot of cops. - I don't blame you. - Guy, you didn't do it. Of course not, but we can't let him bleed to death. No, mademoiselle. It was another who stabbed me. He got away. Go see what's happening. I'm Bracco. Never mind the police. I'll get my revenge my own way. Listen. All right, old man. Take it easy. You'll be all right. You will be rich. Don't have pity on him, huh? You will see. He'll pay you millions. Just do what I say. Say Bracco told you all about him, all about his past. But who is this man? The police - they're coming this way! The police. Don't tell them what I said. - What about us? Guy, will they put me in jail too? - Shut up! Now, listen. What I give to you is two names. - You gotta tell me everything. - This I didn't think I'd give to anyone. It isn't money, but it's worth millions. You are nice to me. It will make you rich. It's Bracco. The American ‒ What's he doing here? Look, I just happened by. I got a boat here. - Your papers. - I'll go on board and get 'em. We'll come with you. Come here. Come here. Please, I must pay him back. Remember, it's a secret. Tell him you know his past. Quick. Come over here. Real smart cop. You'll remember - the name... of the woman. Okay. So you found the cigarettes. This girl has no connection with my business. - Come on, Bracco. What were you saying? What? - Is he dead? What do you think? Bracco was whispering something. Yes, Bracco was talking to you. What was it? He wasn't making any sense. It was just a name. He was dying. - What name was it? - Arkadin. Gregory Arkadin. Mily wasn't waiting for me at the prison gates... but I traced her down to Juan-les-Pins. Smart girl. She'd followed Bracco's hint. Arkadin was in town. - Mily puts on a great show, monsieur. - No, she's not here now. She's off at a party. - Which party? - At the party, naturally. This season a party means just one thing ‒ Gregory Arkadin. Who Arkadin really was and where all that dough came from, nobody could tell me. He had a villa near Monte Carlo and a castle in Spain... Rolls-Royce with a special musical horn... one of the biggest yachts in the world... and at least three passports. To shake him down as Bracco had said wasn't so easy. He was a tough baby to get to - bodyguards and all. But I found he had one weak spot ‒ his daughter, Raina. Yeah, he's real strict with her. She's not even allowed on the yacht. Wonder if there's any way I can arrange to meet him? - So that he can introduce you to the girl? - Nah, it's a business matter. You want to meet his daughter so you can get to talk to him? - Kid, you must be losing your mind. - Or, uh, changing my luck. Quite a looker, Miss Arkadin. She might be tough, but she could lead me to her father. Then there was that boyfriend ‒ one of those titled English characters called, uh, marquis or something or other. The marquis of Rutleigh, but her father thinks nobody is good enough for her, so ‒ - Is Mr. Arkadin with her? - No, he's giving a big party. Not the kind you'd ask your daughter to, if you know what I mean. - Is that the phone switchboard back there? - Yes, sir. Right over there. - Thanks. - Excuse me, darling. I seem to be wanted on the telephone. An awful bore. Okay. - Oh, Miss Arkadin, would you care to dance? - No, I'm sorry. Your friend's gonna be some time on the long-distance phone. How do you know Bob's taking a long-distance call? Who would know better? I put the phone call in myself. You gonna be stuffy about it, or shall we start dancing right now and save some time? Ecoutez! Operator! ♪♪ - Miss Arkadin. - Yes? A message from your father. He's waiting for you and asks you please to remember it's quite late. Yes, but how did he learn that you were here ‒ and so quickly? He runs the greatest private spy system on Earth. Yes, I know that, but when am I going to see you next? - I'm leaving for Spain in the morning. - Are you flying? - In Father's plane? No. - Oh, driving yourself. - Getting an early start before dawn. - I say, it sounds perfectly frightful. - There he is, in the car. - Your father? - Better get back inside. - I say, but look here, old girl ‒ - I'd rather he didn't see us together. - Oh, all right. Oh, excuse me, old man. So sorry. Hey, that's quite a coincidence. I mean, you going to Spain tomorrow. I'm going there myself, you know. - Small world, isn't it? - Yeah. Hi, Pops. How was your party? - Thanks. - Well, what do you know? If it isn't that well-known playboy, Guy Van Stratten. - Oh, there you are. - I heard you out there. - What's all this about Spain? - We'll take that up in a minute. - What were you doing at that party? - It was on Mr. Arkadin's yacht. Arkadin. Do you realize what that means? That's good for you. That's what makes it all so crazy. You and me are on to a big thing, and neither one of us has any idea... how much dough Bracco's tip-off is worth. - Bracco? - He's dead. Guy, I have to tell you something. Yeah, just keep a table. We'll be right in. But, Guy, there was that other name he whispered to me. I mean, besides Arkadin. It was a woman's name. - Why didn't you tell me about it? - The police were taking you away. - Why didn't you write me? - I haven't even seen you since. What good would it have done you in jail? For three months you've been away. Aren't you gonna kiss me even? So you've been to Arkadin's party, huh? - Mm-hmm. - How'd you make out? Oh, there must have been 50 other girls on that boat. Yeah. I hear he's sailing it back to Spain. Next week he's giving a big society ball. Why don't you try to get yourself invited? - To a society ball? - On the yacht, stupid. - All right. - Look, darling. Get on that cruise to Spain. - Use all your charms on him. - Mm-hmm. See what you can find out. Throw Bracco's name at him and the woman ‒ - That's the trouble. - You forgot it, you mean? You see, I couldn't hear very well. And right after that, what's-his-name ‒ Bracco ‒ died. So I couldn't very well ask him to repeat it. Okay. Now, look. You tell Mr. Arkadin you have a friend who was a great pal of Bracco's. - Don't use my name. - Oh, Guy. Guy, be careful. Just tell him, if he's interested, a meeting can be arranged. Look, it's different for me. I'm a girl, and he's a man. There might be an opening in some company he controls. You know, a bright young man who knows things about Mr. Arkadin... who pretends to know. Hello! Are you really going to Spain? - My car broke down. How 'bout a lift? - So that's your technique. - It's a long lift, but all right. - Thanks. That's a lucky break for me. Oh, that? He's one of my father's secretaries. He has all kinds of secretaries. Some of them double as vice presidents. That one's a masseur, and there's Rico. He's in charge of ladies' telephone numbers. But that's something I'm not supposed to know about, of course. Well, that's a castle in Spain, for sure. Thanks for the lift. - You're spending the night here? - I wanna try and talk the local hotel into giving me a bed. I'll show you where it is. - It's either that or - - Or what? Or we develop a sick headache or leaky carburetor or something like that... and we'd be forced to spend the night the other side of the border. - Uh-oh. Here comes the ogre. - Ogre? - Ogre's my nickname for Pops. - Oh, your father. - Didn't you ever read any fairy tales? - No, not many. You know, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread." And that's an ogre, huh? Some kind of a bogeyman. If you meet my father, you'll see what I mean. "If"? You mean, when I meet him. - That's him up there, huh? That plane? - Yes. He flew to Tangiers this morning. Now he's joining me here to get ready for our famous masked ball. That's not till Sunday night. Good. - What's good about it? - Gives us almost a week. - For what? - Getting better acquainted. - Don't tell me you're staying on. - I'm going to your party. - I don't believe it. - Well, why not? - You know all your guests personally? - Of course not. - Well, you know me. - Do I?

Be sure to leave it for Raina... after the party's over. The party seems to be over already, Mr. Arkadin. - Who got this up for you? - Private detectives. It may seem a considerable investment to make for a mere gigolo... a petty adventurer. You see, my daughter is very important to me. There's nothing I would ‒ So I'm a petty adventurer, am I? And what about you, Mr. Arkadin? How do you think it would look if someone got up a dossier on you? What are you two doing in my bedroom? One moment, Raina. I want to be very sure I understand what your friend here is talking about. Yeah, it's quite true! I ran cigarettes, even some gold once. But what about you, Mr. Almighty Gregory Arkadin? How 'bout if somebody got up a confidential report on the subject of you, huh? All the dirt, I mean - from Bracco on down. - I'm ashamed of you. - That's just about the idea.

Your glasses up, friends. In Georgian toasts, a little story always comes first. I had a dream. I found myself in a graveyard... where all the tombstones were marked in a curious way ‒ 1822 - 1826... 1930 - '34. Always like that. Always a very short time between birth and death. In the graveyard was a very old man. I asked him how it was that he had lived so long... when everyone else in his village had died so young. But, no, he told me this - "Not that we die early. "It is just that here, on our tombstones, we do not count the years of a man's life... but rather the length of time he's kept a friend." Let's drink to friendship. - What's wrong? - I don't make a habit of striking women. - Guy! - Don't worry. You're safe. I'm sick of jails, and there's a law against murder. - What did you say to Arkadin? - I haven't seen him, not here in Spain. - Did you tell him anything about me? - No. Why should I? He's got private detectives on me. You put him on me, didn't you? No, Guy. I swear I had nothing to do with it. Both of you wanted to break things up between Raina and me. Well, now you've succeeded. - Where are you going? - Just leaving, that's all. - Am I going with you? - I want to get as far away from here as possible. Guy, I never once talked to Arkadin about you. Oh, and another thing ‒ I've remembered that name. You mean that other name? That woman's name that Bracco told you about? - Am I going with you? - Now, don't get smart. All right, all right. It was ‒ It was Sophie. Sophie? Sophie what? Well, that's just it. I can't remember. It was ‒ It was something Russian. Hello? Oh, I beg your pardon.

This scorpion wanted to cross a river... so he asked the frog to carry him. "No," said the frog. "No, thank you. "If I let you on my back, you may sting me... and the sting of a scorpion is death." "Now, where," asked the scorpion, "is the logic of that?" for scorpions always try to be logical. "If I sting you, you will die, and I will drown." So the frog was convinced and allowed the scorpion on his back. But just in the middle of the river, he felt a terrible pain... and realized that, after all, the scorpion had stung him. "Logic," cried the dying frog as he started under, bearing the scorpion down with him. "There is no logic in this." "I know," said the scorpion, "but I can't help it. It's my character."

Van Stratten... on my mother's grave, I swear to you... I wish I knew. And you figure that if I can't smoke it out... the army boys won't be able to either, huh? I'm going to tell you a story, a poetic little story. It's winter of '27. One night, one snowy night... I found myself, a young man, in Zurich. I had nothing, nothing ‒ only the one suit I was wearing... and the wallet in which there were 200,000 Swiss francs. With that money, my fortune was built. - You see, I promised you this was poetic. - Well? - Well what? - Who was she? "She"? "Who was she?" isn't the question at all. The question is, "Who was I?" Okay, Mr. Arkadin. I'll buy it. Who were you? That's just it. What happened before the winter of '27? Where did I come from in my one suit? That is my real secret... and you are the first man I ever told it to. I do not know who I am. Amnesia. Yeah, but if it's as bad as you claim ‒ - What do you mean, as I claim? - Well, look. You don't have any memory of what happened to you before '27, right? So what makes you so sure your name is Arkadin? Well, maybe it's Arkadeen or Arkadene or Arkapapalous. - Or Smith even. - Don't be a fool. I know my own name. - Who says so? - I say so. Oh, who are you? You just told me you don't know. - I'm paying you to find out. - So why does Ark - Arkadin stick in your mind? Maybe ‒ Maybe it's the name of a cough medicine. Maybe it's somebody you knocked off for the 200,000 Swiss francs. - You think that's how I got the money? - Maybe you stole it. How do we know? Is Guy in there? Mr. Van Stratten is gone. He has left the country, Raina. If you've paid him off, I'll never forgive you, Father. Never. You know, at first I thought it was something else. I rather thought you were blackmailing me. - Here's to character. - Okay, only I need dough for expenses. My travels took me from Helsinki to Tunis... Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva, Zurich... Trieste, Marseille, Copenhagen. I talked to every crook who'd been around in 1927... and a whole lot of other characters too. I claimed I was a newspaperman. And that got me, at last, to Sir Joseph... a retired intelligence chief who gave me my first lead. Sir Joseph is not well enough to give interviews... but out of respect for Time magazine ‒ That is your magazine, isn't it? Sir Joseph has consented to make the following statement... with the understanding that it is not to be quoted. "Gregory Arkadin is one of the shrewdest of all adventurers in high finance... "and certainly the most unscrupulous. "During the last war, I had occasion to make inquiries into his past. "In another epoch, such a man might have sacked Rome or been hanged as a pirate. "Today we must accept him for what he is ‒ "a phenomenon of an age of dissolution and crisis. "As to his former activities, they took place in Warsaw, Poland. "Perhaps flea professor Radzinski, now in Copenhagen... could tell you a little more about that, if he'll talk." Why come to me? I am a legitimate entertainer now. Please, watch your smoking. I am only interested in my fleas. - That's all? - Now we are rehearsing. Besides, I have to get ready for a show in a few minutes... so I cannot give you much time. Oh, please, please, please.

There's nothing a type like that doesn't know about crooks. Crooks ‒ He has them jumping around for him like my fleas... only the fleas are smarter. I got a friend that's due in Tangiers this week. She'll see Tadeus. Oh, come on, Professor. What about Sophie? Sophie? No. A type like that, if she's alive, she's legitimate by now. - What makes you think she'd go straight? - Simple. She was intelligent. Did you ever stop to think why cops are always famous for being dumb? Simple. Because they don't have to be anything else. Crooks aren't the worst people. They're just the stupidest. The fleas of the world. And murder? My friend, after 20,000 years, murder is still a business... that's mainly in the hands of the amateurs. Mily, on the cruise with Arkadin... stopped off in Tangiers to see Tadeus. Tadeus! I'm a friend of Guy's. We used to see you every time we came to Tangiers. You must remember me.

But then, of course, the price... would be a weenie bit steeper. - You haven't answered my question. - You haven't bought my telescope. But I will. I will, Mr. Trebitsch. I'm gonna buy it. Now, what were you going to tell me? Those girls! - Those girls were the ruin of Sophie. - Girls? Ah, Hildegarde. What girls, Mr. Trebitsch? Imagine, my dear - They were hired by the police... to pose as members of Sophie's dancing academy. - What dancing academy? - Well, perhaps you'd be interested in a lovely aquarium for your tropical fish? No, thanks. I already got a telescope. You haven't paid for it, have you? Still, we can always discuss price, can't we, my dear? Now, look, about this dancing academy ‒ I'm buying information. "Buying" means that I'm prepared to pay. I make it a principle never, never to give information... even about people who are dead. I mustn't get a reputation for being indiscreet, now, must I? Especially in my profession. No, what you are buying is a telescope. Oh, fine. Looks as if I'm also buying an aquarium. But if Sophie's dead, I can't see what difference it could ‒ - Dead? Who said she's dead? - Well, nobody says she's alive. I seem to remember she got away from the police when they broke up the gang. The gang? Well, come on, Mr. Trebitsch. What did the gang do? White slavery? Warsaw was the center of that, my dear, before the last war. Oh, my poor baby, you don't know a thing. Why, half the flesh that was run into South America from Central and Eastern Europe... came right through Warsaw. - Wait. I've got something for you. - No, I don't want to buy anything else! - You will buy this one. It's an idea. - Well? - Those young girls - - What girls? The girls I spoke of that acted as special police agents. Well, it just happened, my dear, that one of them turned up here during the war. - During the occupation. - What's her name? Oh, come on, Mr. Trebitsch. I'm paying you for this. She was quite a heroine of the resistance movement... connected, one imagines, with the ‒ British. Once spent the night here in my little shop in '42. We ‒ Ah, we got to talking about Warsaw. You know what we Poles are. Well, the baroness could tell you all about Sophie. Well, fine, Mr. Trebitsch. Where is this baroness? - The Baroness Nagel. - Okay, but where does she live? And here is the telescope. - You see, I believe in giving value. - Value? This thing doesn't even have a lens. Well, what can you expect for 200 guilder? Two ‒ Two hundred? Well, you can always find a lens. Ah! Gustie! Danny! Mittagessen. Ah, if you can pay me in dollars, I can offer you a very good rate. - Oh, guilder. - What ‒ Of course, there will be the usual charge for breakages. - Breakages? - Oh, my beaded curtain I can perhaps re-string. And I may be able to mend up my alligator, but... you've absolutely ruined the pretty aquarium, my dear. Well, you remember the name - Nagel, huh? N-A-G-E-L. Nagel. Nagel. Is that all I'm getting? The Baroness Nagel, hmm? - B-A-R ‒ - I can spell "baroness"! Now, you just tell me where I can find her. My dear, I swear to you on my heart... I haven't the remotest idea where the baroness is... or what happened to her. I'd lost touch with Mily after Tangiers. She was going on with Arkadin on his yacht with a few other good-looking dames. Maybe Mily was becoming independent and going after his money in her own way. - What are you doing in my cabin? - Would you prefer to come to mine? Don't be funny. You said you wanted to be alone with me. Has that slipped your mind? Oh, yes. The message. You better have a little more champagne. It's not me that wants to talk to you. It's a friend of mine. - Guy Van Stratten. - You know everything, don't you? - Only what I need to know - - Bracco, for instance? - for my business. - Oh, sure. Guy told me. Money changing, munitions. Some of the guns you sent to the Reds in China didn't even shoot. Is Van Stratten a communist? - Are you kidding? - Then what's he complaining about? Nobody's complaining. He's just doing that crazy job you gave him. Hey, you didn't answer my question about Bracco. Bracco. Van Stratten mentioned that name. When did you talk to him last? Bracco was killed and murdered on the dock in Naples, Italy. No, I mean, when did you talk to Van Stratten? Seems you were pretty chummy with some Nazi collaborators in Vichy. Have some champagne. They trusted you with all their money, those Nazis... to invest in South America for after the war. - They didn't even ask for a receipt. - I've heard that story before. Now their families can't even prove the money's theirs. And then there's Mussolini. All those roads you built for the fascists in Ethiopia. Bad water, not enough food. Guy says more than a hundred of the men died. You know, you're kind of cute in a weird sort of a way. After a person gets over being scared of you. - Why'd you grow that awful beard? - To scare people with. When'd you grow it ‒ 1927? You know something about that year? Van Stratten's discovered something? We know where you came from. - That's more than I do. - Warsaw. Huh? What's that? Warsaw is a city in Poland. Shut up. I was aware of that. You see, Guy went to see your tailor in Zurich. My what? The tailor who made your first suit of clothes when you came there. - He's dead. - You probably never even noticed the cutter. But he remembers you and the label in the coat you were wearing... when you first came in the shop. - Label? - The tailor's label. Your suit was made in Warsaw. So that's where you came from. Guy couldn't get into Poland now. He'd never get a visa. Awful lot of Poles left home these last few years. Refugees. They went everywhere - all over the place. That ‒ That's what Guy's gonna do: look up an awful lot of Poles. - But where? - Just wherever you say, Mr. Arkadin. Everywhere. All over the place. Baroness von Nagel. Nagel? The Baroness Nagel? Oh, she wouldn't have gone back to Poland. Not the way things are now. Try London. Nagel? Yes. She was decorated by our people and the French. Wonderful girl. Nagel? I think she's working in Paris. She's at one of the big dress houses. Dior, I think. She's a vendeuse. - A what? - A saleswoman. Good. I got something I want to buy. Well, she lives here. Of course. I remember you. You are the gentleman who was here the other day. Well, I'm sorry, monsieur, but the baroness won't be in till late tonight. She has a dinner appointment. Oh, thank you, monsieur. I think it might be with the gentleman who brought her the beautiful flowers... just the day after you were here. He was a big, tall man. With a beard. Yes. With a beard. Sommelier. - Criminal underworld in Warszawa? - Mmm. It's true that for a year or so... I did see a little something of that sort of thing. It wasn't as amusing as you might think. - Criminals aren't ever very amusing. - It's because they're failures. Those who make real money aren't counted as criminals. - This is a class distinction, not an ethical problem. - Here's to crime. - I suppose you want me to tell you about Sophie. - Sophie? She was, in those years, the most important criminal in Poland. However, we did manage to put her out of business. - "We"? - There were several of us. Young girls. And I won't pretend to you that we were not rather thrilled at being part of the secret police. Also, in my case, our family needed the money badly. We were sort of wooden ducks. - How you call it? A decoy? - You mean you were used to collect evidence. Ah, it was a rather nasty business really. The gang masqueraded as a dancing school... where the young ladies went to learn the tango. The victims, of course, ended up in South America. I was glad actually to be useful in breaking it up. The leader got away. Oh, Sophie's been living abroad ever since, in great style. - Sophie. What was her last name again? - She married years ago. - Well, what's her married name? - You are inquisitive. Before telling you that, I ought to ask my employers for permission. Your employers, Baroness? You're a vendeuse working for a dress shop. That means you sold a dress to her, right? - She's a good customer. - She's been in your shop more than once? - Every year, when she comes to Paris. - Comes from where? That is something one mustn't tell, I should think. I thought they were very strict about people with criminal records in Argentina. - Not Argentina. No. - Oh? And not Chile either. No. Don't imagine you can trap me so easily. I'll bet you a couple of hundred dollars... I can trap you, Baroness. Let's make it 500. It's more sporting. Three hundred. That's sporting enough. Here. Write Sophie's married name and address... and then we'll compare notes. Aha. First we'll have some more gypsy music. And you'll buy me another bottle of champagne. Then afterwards -just for the fun of it - you'll show me your money. As you wish. No, no. I really can't. I hate people who sell information. There was somebody else only last week who wanted to know the same thing. - What? - Ah. About Sophie. Ah, digging into the past. It's really too disgusting. Here. Take it as a gift. After all, what's that woman to me? You can't object if I settle our wager. There. You see what I've written? I didn't come within a mile of it. It was Van Stratten who approached you. Yes. - I'm a fool. - Why? Baroness, a fool is a man who pays twice for the same thing. Arkadin and the baroness. Why was Arkadin cutting in on the very job he'd given me? I hoped the baroness hadn't told him where to find Sophie. I had to get to Mexico before him... because now it was a race for Raina. I was hoping for a message from Mily too. I hadn't heard from her for quite a while. No, sir. There's no message. But there is someone to see you. Going to ask me up for a drink? Come on. Guess we have time for one. Oh, yes. And there's somebody else waiting for you. You've been avoiding me. Why? I hope it isn't because of my father. No. I've been away. Belgrade, Zurich. Why all this jumping around? - Job. - For my father? Funny. I thought I caught a glimpse of him here in your hotel. - But that doesn't make sense, does it? - You don't trust me, do you? That's really why I haven't wanted to see you. You mean you need to be trusted? Funny. So does Father. Why funny? Simply because nobody in their right mind could trust either one of you. Raina! What are you doing in this man's room? That's my question, isn't it, Father? Yes. And I think I'd better ask it too. What are you doing here? You can't have known I was coming. I didn't know it myself. - I have business with Van Stratten. - Business? And you gave me your word. His word. He gave me his word he wouldn't see you again. Oh, really? And he swore to me he wouldn't take money from you. - How cheap did you come? - Well, Van Stratten ‒ No. I'm asking the questions now. 15,000 bucks. Well, you wanted the truth, didn't you? You can save us that old-fashioned melodrama about your innocent daughter... all alone with a wicked bachelor in his hotel room. - Only came back to get my bags. Then I'm on my way out of the country. - $15,000. - There's a price tag on every man. - Yeah? What's yours, Mr. Arkadin? 200,000 Swiss francs? You know that was the basis of the great Arkadin fortune? Well, maybe $15,000 will be the basis of mine. - You imagine I'm going to give you that now? - A man needs money to make money, Mr. Arkadin. I wouldn't dream of asking your daughter to marry me as long as I'm broke. - Marry you? - That dough he started with figures to be earned in some dirty way too. I'm gonna find out how. And when I do, who knows? - Maybe I'll wind up an Arkadin myself someday. - You hear? - That's the sort of man you think you're in love with ‒ a blackmailer. - Why can't I be in love with him? I was hired by your father to do a little checkin' up for him. Investigations, like. - Well, it was his idea. Not mine. - That doesn't sound much like blackmail to me. - But you aren't in love with him. - But it seems that you, Father, made him promise to stay away from me. I never promised to do that! Now I'm gonna see you whenever I can ‒ job or no job! - But you're going away again. - Just a short trip. If I'm lucky, it may be the last. You're going to Spain, aren't you? I'll see you there on my way back from Mexico. I wish you would stop having me followed and spied on every minute, Father. Frankly, I'm fed up with living the life of an expensive gypsy. Raina, there is no need to discuss this with Van Stratten. You know, your life can be whatever you want. We only came to Paris because ‒ Because I said I wanted to. And that was because I hoped to see Guy. You see, Mr. Arkadin? I'm afraid things are getting just a little bit out of your control. The baroness had given me the name of Sophie's husband, Oskar, a drug addict. He was my next source of information. ♪♪ You hired me to play my music for a pleasure cruise. Pleasure. I don't know for how long we've been out on this boat. - For how many days I've been without my - - Without your heroin? Ain't that the stuff you use? - You didn't throw it away? - You'll get your junk when you start to talk. - I won't talk. I won't tell you a thing. - We gotta go through this just once again. - You were married to Sophie. - I still am. - Well, she's got a new husband. - Some big shot here in Mexico. Hey. You mean she was never divorced. Is that it? - So it's bigamy. Is it bigamy? - I won't talk! Okay. Okay, buster. We'll just keep you here till you do. What is it you want me to tell you? I want you to tell me about Sophie's gang. All about it. Everything that happened. You could kill me first. I may have to. Well, I didn't have to kill him. Finally Oskar spilled everything. He told me that he was Sophie's real husband... and that her marriage to a retired Mexican general wasn't legal. He told me all about her... and her connection with Arkadin. Your passport, please. These will be returned at the airport. Tossing me out of the country? You better give me a chance to pack. - There is someone in Mexico City who'd like to see you. - Who's that? La Señora Jesús Martínez, the wife of General Martínez. - Sophie? - You know the lady? - Well, I don't exactly know her. - Never mind, señor. You will soon. Sit down, mister. We're putting you on the plane in an hour. But I'd like to hear first what you've got to say for yourself. Sorry, but I really don't have much of anything to say for myself, Madame Radzweickz. Señora Jesús Martínez. This here is my husband. I guess Oskar told you that the general, my husband, isn't ‒ Yeah, but don't think I'm trying to embarrass you. You don't do anything to me, Mr. Smarty. I'll let you in on a secret. It's Oskar I was never married to. He's old now, and he's ‒ he's talked himself into it. A man's got to keep a little pride... and he doesn't earn much playing the concertina, poor little fellow, so... I allow him to blackmail me. Not much. Just enough to keep up his self-respect. - And you. - I'm the one that's got questions to ask. You're the one that's getting tossed out of the country, Mr. Smarty. People torturing other people. That I don't go for. - Poor little Oskar. Why do you have to pick on him? - I wish you'd try to understand. - I'm involved in a serious investigation. - Investigation! Why not leave in peace the people that's minding their own business and not hurting other people? We are married. I got a legitimate business. There is nothing against me that is not all done and over with a long time ago. So, what are you after? I just want to check a few names with you. That's all. Men who worked for you back in Warsaw. You got all that from Oskar. Yeah. Athabadze. Jakob Zouk and the fella with a peg leg. I saw that one fished out of the harbor at Naples. Is this true? Seems he'd come on a freighter from the Balkans. He jumped ship. For some reason he knifed a guy called Bracco... then tried to shoot it out with the cops. - If he knifed this, uh - - Bracco. why did he then use a gun? Why ‒ I never thought of that. So you got the names. What else do you want? I want you to tell me about Athabadze. It's, uh, Van or... Wasaw. - Atha - - What about him? I'd like you to tell me what you thought of him. I was crazy in love with him, mister. - But what's all this to you? - Well, you see, I work for Athabadze. Of course, he has a different name now. Sure. Gregory Arkadin. - You knew that? - Years ago. Chato, give me those photograph albums. And you never said anything? But you must have realized what that information was worth. Money. Money I don't need. But even if I did, mister, that kind of money I couldn't use. Not that Wasaw don't owe me. He does. - 200,000 Swiss francs? - It was in gold. He borrowed this money? If that's the way he remembers it. Give me the old one. Come here. Oskar. There. I guess he must have grown his beard after he left you. He had a beard when I saw him in Monte Carlo. But I knew him. That was years later. Sitting right next to me he was, and he didn't know me. Why should he? Not that he hadn't changed too, of course. But why the beard? I don't know. Maybe it had something to do with his daughter growing up. I wouldn't know either. This is even the first time I've heard about the child. - Who is he married to? - Somebody in Berlin. - Yeah? - She died when Raina was born. Ah. The only time I saw him afterwards was that night in the casino. When he got up from the game and moved over to the roulette... somebody whispered, "There goes the famous Gregory Arkadin." So that's how I found out what happened to my boyfriend... and the money. I was going to talk to him. "Hello, Wasaw," I was going to say. "Where's the money you stole from me? "Where's the gold pieces I had stored away in my old pair of drawers, Wasaw? Now that you are the great Mr. Arkadin, maybe you could afford to pay me back." But I didn't. There was that old, hard, lonely kind of look in his eyes. I thought of all the fun we had together. Besides, he was winning. I'd been playing his numbers, and I was winning too. A whole lot more than what he took from me all those years ago... even figuring the interest. So, I thought to myself... "Here he's gone to so much trouble to be somebody else. Why should I spoil it for him?" I had my money's worth 20 years before. You can go now, mister. And when you see your boss... tell him from me he could leave well enough alone. - You mean he doesn't have to worry about you? - Why does anybody worry? He's a billionaire with a new name. So Oskar takes dope. Let them both have what they need. It's your deal, darling. - Yeah? - Mr. Arkadin is calling you. - Okay. - How are you coming, Van Stratten? Couldn't be better, Arkadin. I finally got the goods on you. - What? - The dirt. All of it. From before '27. - Can you prove it? - On the long-distance telephone? Come and talk to me. I want to talk to you now. I don't think you understand. I'm in Mex ‒ You - You didn't know I was on this side of the ocean. This your first trip to Mexico? It's mine. Seem to be treating you pretty good, huh? This part of the hotel is private. They keep it for me. - I suppose you own the hotel. - Well, as a matter of fact ‒ Okay. - What does she say? - Chiquita says she wants to go waterskiing. It's an amusing sport. I'd like to try it myself. - Yeah. You'd look real cute in a pair of water skis. - Oh, you think it'd be funny? I'll take your picture. You can judge for yourself. - Mr. Arkadin would look exactly like Neptune. - Who? Neptune. He was the god of the sea. - Yeah? Did you know that? - No. That's what I thought. We're both a couple of mugs. I'm leaving tonight. Sell our Mexican pesos and buy Chilean. Remember what I said about copper. Oh, and, uh, get Chiquita a little present to remember us by. Check. - I found Sophie. - Sophie. She's married money, but a character known as Oskar's her real husband. - He's blackmailing her. - Oh? - I'll put all the details in my report. - Never mind your report. - But I do mind it. I'm gonna get paid for it. Remember? - Tell me what you know. In the old days in Warsaw, Sophie had nine men working for her. Four are dead. Two are behind the iron curtain, so they can't make you any trouble. Oskar's here. That leaves somebody in Germany called Jakob Zouk. - And one other. - And this other man? What's he up to? - He says he wants to go waterskiing. - Any proof? Not till I take your picture. I'm sorry. I forgot. You're camera shy. - Stop trying to be funny. - I think it's funny! You were born near Tiflis. Your real name is Wasaw Athabadze. I think it's funny. - Who says that's my name? - Oskar. So would Sophie ‒ Are you trying to tell me in all seriousness that... I belonged to this gang? You belonged to Sophie. I ‒ This man in Germany - Can he identify me too? Zouk's in a safe place, Mr. Arkadin. He's in jail. Speaking of jail... there's some gentlemen waiting to talk to you. - Well, tell 'em I'm busy. - I think you'd be wiser to see them. They're from the police, and they want to take you to your plane. - Oh, and one thing more. - Yeah? These things you claim to be finding out about me ‒ don't speak of them to my daughter. - I have your word on that? - My word? What's that worth to you? Perhaps a man like you can't realize what it is to have a conscience... and no memory at all. You imagine it's pleasant to be ashamed of something you can't even remember? On my way through to Germany I stopped off in Spain to see Raina. Will all passengers proceed ‒ I intended to go to Germany too, you know, for Christmas.

What makes you think he's a Russian? - Well, I'm his daughter. - He doesn't know himself. - He really doesn't! - Is that what he told you? - What about the famous amnesia? - Amnesia? Look. In 1927, your father found himself alone in Zurich with no memory at all. He didn't know who he was, where he‒ When I arrived in Munich...

As a matter of fact ‒ It's very interesting to learn how you that knew. - Knew that. - Well, a man died right in front of me. Well, the Italian police sent us a photograph of the victim.

Go ahead, Van Stratten. Go upstairs and talk to him. Shivering. It's cold. There is no heat in this building. And the rent they charge.

A hot goose liver ‒ That's the thing with the one day warning. - Goose liver. - Okay. Thank you very much. I'll think of something. If I don't get that goose liver, I'm going home. Well, how about a nice big cut of roast beef? Or maybe a hot stuffed turkey? - Goose liver. - But look. Arkadin ‒ Arkadin, schmadin! Aaah! Didn't even recognize me. Are you sure? Didn't say nothing. Hey. Hey. Hey! You're leaving me! Wait! Get back! Will you keep the door locked? We registered in the hotel under false names, but you can't tell.

Yeah, but ‒ - You're a dangerous man to be seen with. - Yeah. I guess that's the way you had it planned all along. I knew what I wanted. That's the difference between us. In this world there are those who give and those who ask. Those who do not care to give... those who do not dare to ask. You dared. But you were never quite sure what you were asking for. Now there's nothing more you could hope to beg from me, Van Stratten. Not money. Certainly not my daughter. Not even your life. Give the gentleman his goose liver. Well, here we are.

You must put that man off the plane. He works for Mr. Arkadin. Sir, Mr. Van Stratten has a reservation. - Miss, I want to send a telegram, please. - Just a moment, please. Mr. Arkadin is one of the leading shareholders in your airline. Sorry, sir, but an airline is a public service. Besides, this is Christmas. Announcing the departure of Flight 16 for Barcelona and Madrid. - Did you get my telegram off to Spain for me? - Yes, Mr. Van Stratten. Will you please step this way? There's a gentleman waiting to see you. See me? But what about my plane? He promised to keep you only a minute. There's nothing at this late hour. I want your seat on that plane.

Bring her to the radio at once! Raina! - Well, chum, what's eating you? - Miss Arkadin, it's your father. Something urgent. I don't care what that is. I've gotta talk to you first alone. - Just a minute. - Alone! Okay, okay. What's all the rush with you? Your father's on his way in a chartered plane. He'll be here anytime now. - Exactly ‒ - I know this sounds nutty, but ‒ - Will you please excuse us for just a second? - It's all right, old boy. If you insist. - Mr. Arkadin says that - - Sorry. Both of you! You too! Now, look. I want you to pretend to him that I told you something. If it's so important, why shouldn't you really tell me? Why pretend? Why? Well, I can't go to the cops. They'll be comin' after me. So that's what you're in such a flap about. Not just the cops. Your father! If he thinks I've talked to you, he'll know he can't lay a hand on me without proving it's true. But why use me to trick him? Because you're all he really cares about - you and what you think of him. What are you trying to do? Break his heart? - I want to save my life, Raina. - Señorita, I really think you'd better come now. My daughter! I want to speak to my daughter! We don't know his exact position. He's alone, flying himself in a chartered plane. He's been on the radio for a while, asking to talk to you. He sounds - Well, you better speak to him yourself. Put her on! I want to talk to her! - My daughter! I want to speak to my daughter! - Yes, Father. Have you seen Van Stratten? - Yes. Tell him yes. Yes. - Yes. Yes. Just now! Don't let him talk to you. Refuse to listen. I beg you. Wait! - Tell him it's too late. Too late! - It's too late. Father. Why don't you answer? Father. Father. Father. Hey. Hey, look. Is it true? That Arkadin's plane's flying around up there empty? I saved your precious life for you. I had to kill my father to do it. Is there anything else you want from me? You want to know the real truth? He was ‒ He was capable of anything. Once, a long time ago... he was something less than Mr. Arkadin. That's what he couldn't stand having you know about. That he was once something like me. I might as well have thrown him out with my own hands. He would have done it to you. - Maybe you oughta go after her. - You sure she wouldn't rather be alone? - No, but I would. - Yes, I suppose so. Of course, it is rather awful, but to tell the truth ‒ "Rather awful"? I mean, she loved him well enough. But the way he felt about her ‒ It ‒ Well, it wasn't healthy. It's better just as well. - She's better off without him. - Yeah? Better off without me too? "Rather awful." - What did you say? - Losing the girl I love? A beautiful girl who loved me, just inherited a hundred million bucks? "Rather awful"? Maybe you oughta find a better word. Go on. Beat it, Your Lordship. I might just forget myself and take a punch right at your nose. Oh, yes? And you might get punched back too, you know. Yeah. I know. That's why I'd rather be alone. - What are you gonna do now? - Drive somewhere. I'll do the driving.
