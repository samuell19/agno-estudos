- What do you think? - Who cares! You wanted me to see your lousy shot. I don't give a damn! I never said I'd teach you! Why not? You dare ask me to teach you to shoot after you beat me? I haven't slept since then. I went home, ate, took a bath and lay down. But I couldn't sleep, even though my body was exhausted. I saw replays of the game when I closed my eyes. I'd forgotten the feeling. My chest tightening, feeling nauseous and pissed off, and my head pounding. I had almost forgotten that feeling. The pain was just as bitter as it used to be. It was the worst night ever. But... that's why I really want to play basketball now. Aomine-kun... Now I'm really starting to want to play basketball. I'm saying I can play with you. I'll teach you to shoot. Game over! I can't believe this. This is a basketball game, isn't it? A match between a regional powerhouse and a weakling might have a similar score, but this is a national tournament and the second and third rounds in a row. They are the complete opposite of the super-aggressive Too. Shutouts two games in a row. Even "ironclad" is too mild to describe their overwhelmingly powerful defense. So, this is Yosen High. So, this is what they are like. What do you think, Okamura? I like it. They've got backbone. They even won against Too. Their offense is probably the best in this tournament. I can't wait for tomorrow. A super-defensive team and a super-offensive team. Which is the best, the strongest spear or the strongest shield? Dai-chan, hurry up! Why did I also have to come? You're the one who ditched our shopping trip. Make it up to me. YOSEN - SEIRIN 18 - 2 - 0 Eighteen to zero? Uh-oh, they're on thin ice. I'm surprised though. Seirin's offense isn't weak at all. And yet they were shut out in the first quarter? That damn guy. So powerful! Let's crush them! I'm not gonna miss this one! Huh? You think you can dodge me like that? Of course not. So that's his plan! A dual attack by Kiyoshi and Kagami! Murasakibara? He's not only big, but he's got quick reflexes! It's over. No! We're not done yet! Six out of ten. Isn't it getting worse? Maybe you'd do better by passing the ball to the hoop. Try pushing the ball with your palm, so you'd be able to shoot more easily. What? He can still catch up to the ball? Nope. Not even you can stop the shot, Murasakibara. Like his drive... it'll disappear. Yes! - Kuroko! - Yeah! We finally scored the first basket from the Shield of Aegis! Kurochin... As I expected... They benched Tetsu. A shot! A fake? He totally looked like he was going to shoot. You can't! Pincer attack! Yeah! He did it! His shot mesmerized me! I could see it, but couldn't react. That number 12 is really something. What? He's new to this tournament, so we have very little info about him. But, is he the type to be wary of at first sight? Still? Do you still see me as your brother in some part of your heart? When we were little, I didn't care because our differences in ability were so obvious. But when he grew as big as me in middle school, I knew for sure. I didn't want to lose to him. Tatsuya? Tatsuya! Taiga. It's been a while since graduation. I won't go easy on you. Sure! That day I beat Himuro for the first time. Wow, you've really improved. However, there was no difference in our abilities. We played almost every week, winning and losing. Then, when both of us had won 49 games and lost 49 games... If I lose the next game, I can't call you my little brother anymore. I won't deserve to be your big brother if I lose. What? I didn't mean anything like... Sorry, but I just can't accept it. I don't want to lose as long as I'm your big brother. So, I can't stay your brother if I lose. But right after that, I went back to Japan, so I didn't play with Himuro after all. It's not a fake this time! Block! Mirage Shot. Impossible. The ball passed through his block. You and I are enemies. Come at me like you're going to kill me. Kagami! What? Me? Is she sure? Maybe to give him time to cool off. His weakness is his compassion. But you can't keep worrying about him. We're in more trouble here. We'll score two points against them. In other words, we're going to break the Shield of Aegis. You got that, Kiyoshi? The first shot is everything. I know. To be honest, that's not my specialty, but I won't fail. Aren't you guys giving up yet? What? I'll never understand why losers keep trying to win. Win or lose doesn't matter. Striving for your goals is really fun! You don't enjoy basketball? What? It's so annoying to hear him say that. A double clutch! Don't act like you live a fulfilling life when you're just going to lose. It's still alive! When did he get there? You got that? The first shot is everything. The center is shooting a three? There you go, Kiyoshi! He was just lucky, huh? Kiyoshi's three was not in our data. I don't think they can keep going like this. It's not even a clever game plan. Yes! Nice shot! - Damn! - Don't worry. It's just the start. Yeah. Now, let's get to the point. We'll break the Shield of Aegis. What the hell... Let's have some fun. Is he the point guard? What the hell are they up to? I'm counting on you, Teppei. Another three? Crap, I can't reach him! Everything you do is annoying. Kiyoshi! Now I get it. Seirin is going to win this battle. Got it! What? Repeating attacks can't break Murasakibara's defense. Because he is not only big, but he's got quick reflexes, and he can reach most shots without jumping. But even Murasakibara has to jump to stop Kiyoshi's mid and long-distance shots. And once he jumps, he can't go to the next move until he lands. Then they launch a series of attacks. He can do nothing but watch it happen. I said "Win or lose doesn't matter," but that doesn't mean I'm going to lose at all! - He did it! - Only nine more points! You don't enjoy basketball? I'll show you how cruel basketball is. Oh, I can't take this anymore. I am so disgusted and feel like puking. To see the likes of you buzzing around. Can we really stop this? I'm going to destroy... He's coming. ...that hard work, guts, and belief, and all that stuff. Three! I know I can't stop you alone. Really? So? The hammer of destruction. Thor's Hammer. Not over yet! Murasakibara is now on offense, so we'll have a chance for counterattacks. We'll get points back with fast breaks! He's catching up. No way! Izuki! I can stop you alone. Come on. He jumped to block! But Kiyoshi-senpai's true potential starts here. Passing with his Right of Postponement! He blocked this path with his left hand? I'm already tired of that. He stopped it. He broke Kiyoshi the point guard... No, you won't, Murasakibara! Kagami! Basketball is a defective sport to begin with. When basketball hoops are 10 feet off the ground, there's no such thing as "fair." Bigger guys always have the advantage. That's the basis of this shitty sport. What's so good about this sport? It's all garbage to me. He broke the hoop. Seriously? He's gotta be kidding. That surprised us, too. Because the hoop was broken, the game will be suspended. Until it's replaced with a new one... SHOEI MIDDLE SCHOOL You're working so hard. Don't push yourself too hard. It's just so much fun. I'm happy because I've always had a complex about my big body. Plus, I want to protect you all, no matter who the opponents are. Is that all you've got? I got frustrated and gave it my all, but I guess I didn't have to. I think you said you'd protect your team or something earlier, but you couldn't protect anyone after all. We're being attacked. We can't stop Murasakibara! Are we no match for them? Rebound! No! We're not done yet! Vice Claw! So, like this? What? No way! Damn you! I won't let you! I won't let you do that again. Ever! - Kagami! - Kiyoshi! Damn it! Kiyoshi-senpai! Teppei! It's not over yet. It's not... Oh, thanks. This is reality. You were helpless and ran out of energy. If you get benched, your spirit will completely die. No matter how much you struggle, Seirin is going to lose. So, how do you feel now? You couldn't protect anyone again. Did you enjoy playing basketball? Seirin, substitution! Kiyoshi-senpai! Sorry. I'll leave the rest to you. Please win. Murasakibara, damn you! What are you so mad about? You just told him that if he got benched, Seirin would lose no matter how much we struggled. Yeah. The game isn't over yet. Besides, his will is with us even if he's not on the court. I will defeat you on his behalf! Let's go! New formation! Full-court man-to-man defense! So that's their plan. Once Atsushi gets the ball, there's no way we can stop him. Before Murasakibara reaches under the basket, they forced us into a game of stamina and speed. We also need speed to break through. Run! If you stop running, they'll get you right away! Wait. Atsushi! When did this guy start guarding me? This is not full-court man-to-man defense. They keep rotating their marks. He told you. It's a new formation. It fully optimizes Kuroko's speed, the Stealth Full-Court Man-to-Man Defense! Kuroko! A full-court is tough. - Can we hang on till the end? - We have to. But, I don't think Yosen is going to sit idly by. Coach, I have an idea. When they break through the full-court and move to the half court, let us run a 2-3 zone with me in the middle... Please. You can do that? I'll stop whoever comes on behalf of Kiyoshi-senpai. Kagami... Okay. In the fourth quarter, we'll run the Stealth Full-Court Man-to-Man Defense, and then a 2-3 zone for the half court... Kiyoshi, don't get spaced out. Can't you come up with any good ideas? Why are you crying? Teppei? Why am I crying? That's what I'm asking! Well, I don't know what to say, but I think I'm relieved to see how dependable you guys are. I realize that I am not on my own. Huh? Did you just realize something that obvious? That pisses me off! Sorry, it pissed me off too. Me, too. Koga, will you get me the slapping fan from the bag? What? Is there... There it is! Hey, we got no time for that! Yeah... right. A team is not only something you protect, but it protects you, too. It's not that there is a team first and each one of us supports it, but we support each other and we become a team. So, I won't waver again. After all... All right! Seirin... Fight! Yeah! Riko, I love basketball after all. I'm so glad I play basketball. What are you talking about? So, I'll never ask you again. Do me a favor. If I can't pass... Damn! He made me pass him on purpose because he knew Kuroko was there? Oh, I'm really frustrated! Crap! Go back! It's a counterattack! No way... Kagami! Hey! Do you think you can stop me? Fine. How come? Is he flying? It's a super jump in the zone. This is no longer a leap. He's flying like a bird! - Nice block! - He stopped his Mirage Shot! Pass me the rock! That's... I'll slam it down with full power! Take this! Thor's Hammer! How could he? Sorry, I pushed you too hard. I can't believe he could stop Mukkun. Only those who are in the same zone can stop Kagami now. Couldn't someone on Yosen do that? Maybe Mukkun or Himuro-san. Maybe, but highly unlikely. Unlikely? What do you mean? I don't fully understand the zone, but I'm sure about one thing. The minimum requirement to get into the zone is to devote himself completely to the sport, or in layman's terms, to love basketball more than anything else. And that's the only thing Murasakibara lacks. What about Himuro? He doesn't lack that. Yeah, but I doubt if he's good enough to get into the zone. A fake like Himuro's. Or maybe even better! No way... Why am I falling first when I jumped after him? I've heard about it. But I can't believe there really is someone who can actually do that! Air Walking! Hey, what did you just say? I said, I'm done. I quit. I'll get benched. Don't be stupid! What the hell you think you're doing? I don't get him. Get me the bamboo sword. I'm gonna kill him. If you get benched now, we can't win. Are you okay with us losing? Yeah, because nothing can stop Kagami. Cut the crap, Atsushi! The game is not over yet! What the hell... That kind of enthusiasm annoys me the most. You're no better than I am against Kagami. Don't you see that he's gifted? I know that, of course. Because I've always been jealous of his gifts. And you, who have something I want so badly, are just about to ditch the game. I'm almost losing myself with anger. I'm so weirded out. You're so annoying. I mean, I can't believe you're crying. I kinda noticed it, but I didn't think you'd go this far. It's the first time I've been so annoyed that I ended up admiring you. All right, I'll stay on the court until the end. Masako. I told you to call me "Coach"! Can you give me a hair tie? They were arguing. Are they good now? Well, they look better, don't they? They really look better than ever. Not just Murasakibara. Himuro seems to have refocused his mind. Screen! No, they've already figured out the Mirage Shot! Hate to admit it, but I do. You're amazing, Taiga. But sorry, we'll still win. He passed the ball! What? He is beyond the ordinary! Unbelievable! I told you. I hate to lose. So I will win! For real? I've never seen Murasakibara like that. All right! Neither side is willing to budge! Only one minute left! Who will win? To close the gap in points, we have to stop that coordinated play somehow. But Kagami is already on the edge. What should we do? One step short of winning... It's Yosen's ball! Seirin, substitution! Hey, don't be so gloomy, guys. We're just one step closer. Let's enjoy it. Welcome back. I'm back. Kiyoshi! There's one minute left. Let's go! I knew there was something going on back there. He was trying to recover his strength. I'm astounded. How many times do you want to be smashed? You're too persistent! That's my selling point. Are you aware of the situation? We're on the edge. I'm aware of that. It's just the situation. It's not over yet. Let's enjoy it. We'll beat Yosen! They are coming at us with their last ounce of strength. I can't even do a throw-in. Pass me the rock, Liu! Damn it! We're gonna win! We'll finish you off! Kagami! That monster! Just go. No more passes. It's your job to score here. What's going on? This power... It's heavier than any of his past dunks. He's crazy! I'm gonna be pushed down at this rate... Don't give up. We'll win, no matter what! Yeah! Come on! Counterattack! Wait a minute. How could he already be here... Way too fast! It can't be... Murasakibara... He cut in. Kagami! Squeeze all your strength to the last drop! We will win! The ace will score with everyone's wishes on his back! I'll go beyond any limits! He did it! We won! We turned the tables! It's not over yet! Atsushi! It's a counterattack! Kagami! He can't jump? No way... Atsushi has been jumping a lot with that massive body since confronting Kiyoshi the point guard. His knees can no longer bear the load. I don't care! The hoop is right up there! Even if I can't jump, I can shoot it. It was never my intention, but it's because of Kiyoshi-senpai's and our team's persistence. So, this is... the end! Yeah! Seirin High wins 73 to 72. Bow! Thank you very much! You won. Thank you. Murasakibara. Let's play again. Huh? No way. Because I'll quit playing basketball now. Will he quit? He won't. There's no way he hates basketball with all his heart. We're gonna win next time, Atsushi. What? I said... I'll quit. Really? Doesn't look like you will to me. This is just the beginning for you. Go for it! Sorry, Tatsuya. I just wanted to fix it. I know. I'm sorry about what I said to you in the US. But I don't think I can go back with you... Forget it. I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry, Taiga. I want to play with you again. I mean... Will you? Tatsuya... As your opponent, and as your brother, I'll be there to root for you. So, good luck. SEIRIN HIGH LOCKER ROOM Today's game will probably be completely different from anything we've seen so far. In short, we will lead and get away from them. We have to, to win this game. Kise's Perfect Copy. That's too formidable. The game is on. The miraculous rising stars, Seirin High. And the blue elite who wear the traditional blue, Kaijo High. But I heard that Kaijo lost a practice match to Seirin in the past. Seriously? So, it's a fateful confrontation. Good luck. You, too. I used to see him as immature as a captain. He seems to have matured since he's gotten this far. Great. That's what I'm talking about. Now we can take our revenge without hesitation. Kagami. I didn't forget the frustration of losing a game for the first time in my life even for a single day. A combination play with Kuroko? Kuroko! It's an Alley-Oop! I won't let you! I don't want anything back from you! This is the end! Thanks to you guys, I realized one thing. I love basketball so much that I can devote myself to it. So I'll never lose again. Kise. - Did it take you that long to realize it? - What? Anyways, have you become softer? Enough talking. I'm getting impatient. Let's get started. Do you agree with him? Yes. And if I may say one thing. I used to dislike you. What? What? Aren't you too straightforward? I'm so depressed... Don't get me wrong. I mean it in a good way. When you joined the team, I became your trainer. That's why you were special to me. But you surpassed me in no time. I understand that you're gifted, unlike me. Still... I got frustrated and didn't want to lose to you. So I've always seen you... as my rival, since then. Oh, God... You really mean it? I'm fired up to hear it! We will now begin the match between Kaijo High and Seirin High. Bow! Let's go! Vanishing Drive! Let's go, Kuroko! He's performing two special moves in a row right at the start! Phantom Shot! All right! At the start of the game? There's one thing Kagami said before the game that offended me. When and who's become softer? Okay! When I see that, I can feel it. His block is now exactly the same as Murasakibara's! Kise! No, you don't! A fake? And it's Aomine's Change of Pace? He's got Midorima's shooting skill and Aomine's agility! Even one at a time, they're formidable, and what should we do if they're combined? Bring it on! Kise! Kagami! Stop him! Not a chance. No one can stop me now! Don't tell me... That's Akashi's Emperor Eye... Let's go, Kise! Damn you! Each skill is reproduced by substituting a different factor for the missing one. So none of them are technically the same as the original. But the quality is too high to describe it as mere copying. Perfect Copy, that's literally invincible. Kise is unstoppable! Right from the start, he's invincible! They're already up by 13 points! KAIJO - SEIRIN 15 - 1 - 2 I'm exhausted! I'm gonna take a break. What? It's so exhausting to copy all those people. I can't be down at the beginning of the game. The game has just begun. I'll save some fun for later. Anyways, I've done my job for now. We've got the momentum. Damn, when we can't waste any seconds! They failed a few attacks. They are losing their cool. Seirin probably aimed to lead and get away from them. However, they were caught by the surprise attacks. Instead of leading, they were outpaced from the start. They will just keep spinning their wheels at this rate. Kagami! Damn it! It's all right, Kobori. Offense! Looks like his engine is starting to rev up. Great. You don't! He stopped him! Neither ace is giving in! I will break through this time. I will stop you again! This guy is the same kind as us, the Generation of Miracles. He's of the Generation of Miracles that took a different path from ours. That's why I strongly refuse to lose to this guy! I win! Screw you! Nice, Kagami! Fast break! Kise's jump now was much lower than usual, wasn't it? Damn it! Kaijo, substitution! Kise, bench. What? Why me? If I get benched now... Kise, just do as the coach says. Substitution? It can't be... Kise... Kise. I knew it. You hurt your leg, didn't you? You noticed. But I still wanna play! I'll suffer through it. I don't want to lose like this. You'd already lost when you put yourself in this situation. Damn it... That was very harsh. If his injury was severe, the coach wouldn't let him play in the first place. I'm sure he will come back. But we're in trouble if we can't play without him. Show some grit, you guys. Yeah! This is our chance. Yeah. We're going to attack them with Kagami in the lead. Yes. Kagami-kun. I know. I feel sorry for him. But that's why I won't hold back. Yes. Double team! We won't let you break! Kagami! Here! Yes! Is that Phantom Shot? He scored! Damn it! I'm sorry, I should've defended him more. Hey, you're double teaming against Kagami now. Are you an idiot? And if you're that close to him, you'll fall for that Misdirection... I think I know the secret of that disappearing shot. Coach, isn't it about time? Right. Are you replacing Kuroko? Yes. But Kaijo doesn't seem to be able to handle Kuroko at this point, so, we can still keep him... It's just because Kuroko has been dodging them well. Next time the ball is dead, we'll replace him. Mitobe, get ready. Go for it, Kuroko! Kasamatsu! He's backing off! I see it now. On a typical shot, the defense is facing up. But because he throws a shot like pushing away from his chest, the shooting position is low, and the defense is facing down. So the rapidly ascending ball went out of sight in an instant. At the same time, Kagami drew his attention and he lost sight of the ball. As if the ball just disappeared. But if he backs off instead of jumping, he will have a wider field of vision. Now, he needs speed to get the ball back. It's completely visible! He stopped it! Senpai! Seirin, substitution! Kuroko. I'm sorry. I was blocked before I got replaced. I'm sorry for breaking the flow. Oh? He's not shocked, is he? Aren't you shocked? Of course, I am. But I'm all right. It's not like we've lost yet. And we have a reliable ace. He scored! He beat the double team! Too high! Go! Passing it? The second quarter ends! That's a tie! We're even now! What the hell was that nice pass! Why you hitting me! It's an intermission. Come on. KAIJO HIGH LOCKER ROOM Coach! Please let me play! I'm the only one who can stop Kagami! Wait until the last two minutes. Until then, I can't let you play. Why... - At this rate... - Kise! Moriyama-senpai, please say something! Come ba... I can't help but say, "Come back." Kise. Senpai. I know how you feel. The third quarter begins. He's not in... But you can't. Wait... Why not? Shut up! This is an order, idiot! Don't talk back to me, freshman! He's such a jock. Come to think of it, I had a similar experience when I entered Kaijo. I'm Shohei Nagaoka from Iwai Middle. I'd like to play shooting guard. Okay, next. It's me. So, I'm the last one. I'm Ryota Kise! My favorite hobby is basketball, and my specialty is singing karaoke. Oops, that was the opposite. I'm from Teiko Middle. I can play any position. I'm also working as a model, so, I may not be able to participate in practice as much. Nice to meet you all! He's one of the Generation of Miracles... And he's shallow... Shut up. I only asked you your name, school, and position. Just answer the questions you're asked promptly! You're so shallow! Ow! Hey... Is this how you should treat a promising rookie you've scouted? Who cares? Don't talk back to me, freshman! I don't like that kind of strictness. Are you guys so great just because you were born a year or two earlier? And I'm probably a better player than you guys. - We're great. - What? Before we talk about better or not, this is Kaijo High Basketball team. These guys have worked harder, and contributed to this team longer than you have. Have some respect for that. I don't care about the Generation of Miracles or whatever. You're a freshman at Kaijo High now, Ryota Kise. And I'm the captain, Yukio Kasamatsu. Got a problem with that? I'm so pathetic and pissed off at myself. We're desperately holding our ground. And Kise's our only hope. But I'm happy to do it if it means winning. Fast! That's a full drive in top gear! No, you don't. Yes! Senpai! Kasamatsu! Rebound! He did it! He forced the shot! Kaijo has so much grit! Hey, look at them. We lead by ten points! We can win if we lead by 15 points. I can't be sure of that, of course, but if we lead by 15 points, even the Perfect Copy can't turn the tables. Chances of getting away with it to the end are higher. Five more points and we can checkmate. Coach. Rebound! He pushed it in! Kaijo is trying to hang on! We can't lose! Never let them take the lead! We're gonna win! We'll score more points at all costs! Patience. Be patient! Please! Hang in there! Hayakawa-senpai, Moriyama-senpai. Kobori-senpai, Nakamura-senpai. Kasamatsu-senpai! It's an Alley-Oop! - They lead by 15 points! - Kaijo is cornered! Kise, wait! Not yet! No, I'm in! We still have four minutes. If you play more than two minutes on that leg, you'll suffer later... Coach. The role of an ace is to lead his team to victory, right? If I don't go now, I'm not an ace. If I don't go now, I'm going to regret it. Because I love this team. Fine. But, If I judge that you're in trouble, I'll replace you right away. Got it. - I want a substitution. - Substitution, please. Here you are. I was waiting... Kagami-kun. Apparently, we can't slack off even for a second. No. Until we hear the buzzer for the end of the game, we never know what will happen. Stay focused till the end! Hands up and speak up! Okay! Hey! There he is! Kaijo High ace, Kise! He can't be... We'll beat Seirin! Perfect Copy! All right! No way... He's as outrageous as ever. But I kinda knew this was gonna happen. So... I won't be intimidated by this! Kagami-kun! Counter! What? And... It's a layup! Aomine's agility plus Murasakibara's block! Oh, crap! Go back! What... Are you kidding me? He copied Tetsu's pass. - Nice shot, Kobori-san! - Yeah. We'll win at all costs! Seirin, time out! You can do that? I'm not sure. But I think it's possible. Predict who he will copy? Perhaps "persuade" would be more appropriate than "predict." That's the only way they can stop Ryota. This is possible with Tetsuya, who routinely observes people. Recognize Ryota's playing trends and habits and predict his next play. Anyway, if we don't stop Kise, we won't win. We have no choice but to leave it to Kuroko. Let's go! We still have a chance to win! Don't give up until the end! Seirin, fight! All right! He looks... He's fast! Yes! No! He can't pass! Go back! Aomine's drive or Akashi's Emperor Eye. Or both. Don't think! Concentrate! He's not passing? Don't tell... He used Midorima's three as a fake! Crap! He's too fast! Kise! So high! It's an Alley-Oop! They did it! Kaijo turned the tables! All right! Yes! Nice! For Seirin, the next attack is the last chance to observe Ryota's play. If Tetsuya can't figure it out, Seirin will lose. Run and gun! What are they up to? With this score and the time, they should attack more cautiously. Three? Crap! I can't dodge him! I'll lose the ball! All right! Okay! Let's go! Yes! We turned the tables! Stay cool! We still have time! If we get one using the rest of the time, we will win! Yeah! I just figured it out. I'll leave the rest to you. Okay. This is the last one, Kise. Bring it! Kuroko, what are you up to? Kagami is standing by behind him. I know that you guys will attack me in tandem. Defense! Defense! Defense! No, he won't. Kuroko is always struggling to win. I used to look down on him for being a lame guy. But he's the first lame guy I've ever respected. I was really happy when he called me a rival. So... I want to win! No way... Steal! It's impossible. Even by surprise, he can't go fast enough. Kise! I knew he'd come. I'll dodge him here and finish it! He held on! He cut back twice! Damn it! I'll stop you! This is it! That's... Murasakibara's... Thor's Hammer! Go! Something isn't right. It's going too smoothly. If I could make it, Kuroko's mark would be meaningless. Yes! It's not over yet. The ball is still alive! But even if I get the ball, I can't throw a shot from there. You're a freshman at Kaijo High now, Ryota Kise. Got a problem with that? No! The role of an ace is... to lead his team to victory! Oh, man. If I don't score this shot, I'm not a man. All right! You're awesome, Kuroko. I don't think it's not perfect. If you can read Kise's move, then we can concentrate on that... Then, maybe we can stop him. However, this is about him in middle school when he was a maverick player. Kise has changed. I can't narrow down his play, considering that he'd probably pass the ball. I'm really sorry. So, I am not asking you... to stop Kise. Not over yet! Kagami! Go! So fast! Too fast! Even if I could catch up with him, he's far too tall for me to stop him! What should I... Kagami! No way... Seriously? He's too fast! What can I do? I got no time to dribble past him. Then, it's all or nothing. Kise! No, I'm not jumping high enough. I'm not gonna make this shot! Kagami-kun! Kuroko! But you're one step too late. He's about to release the ball. You can't stop him from trying to dunk! Not over yet! Yeah! You did it, man! All right! We did it! Yeah! Yes! Kise. We lost. Kise... Dude, you beat me twice! I can't even come up with a parting shot. But it feels great. I gave it my all, so I have no regrets. Kise. You were really formidable. We won, but we could not stop you. Oh, man. It would be nothing even if I won alone. I used to be proud to have you say that to me. It just sounds sarcastic to me now. I'm sorry. We'll win next time. Let's play again next year. Yes! Seirin High School wins 81 to 80. Bow! Thank you very much! My leg... But that's okay. It's already over. Senpai... It's obvious that you're in pain, you know. You can model, but you'll never be an actor. I wanted to win. Yeah. I wanted to win with you all. I know. Next time we play them, it's going to be even tougher. Yes. Kaijo's Kise is one of the best players. Let's go, Satsuki. Wait a minute, Dai-chan. Let's go. Subtitle translation by: Kanako Murakoshi
