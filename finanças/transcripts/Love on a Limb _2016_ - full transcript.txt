DONE. DONE. AND... OH, YEAH, SO DONE. I JUST WALKED INTO SO MUCH CREATIVE ENERGY. YOU CRACKED THE SLOGAN, DIDN'T YOU? NOT EVEN CLOSE. WELL, I WAS CLOSE, THEN I WASN'T, THEN I WAS AGAIN, NOW I'M NOT. IT'S A CREATIVE PROCESS. LET'S GET BACK TO BASICS. WHAT'S OUR GOAL? ENCOURAGE TOURISM TO AMPLE HILLS BY LAUNCHING A NEW WEBSITE TO COINCIDE WITH THE FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL. OKAY, SO THAT GIVES US TWO WEEKS. MY FAVORITE ONE SO FAR IS... "THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF YOU." I THINK MY CREATIVE PROCESS IS JUST A PROCESS. WE JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE ONE YET, BUT I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO CHECK IN ON FARM-FRESH FOOD FAIR. I BELIEVE IN YOU! TEAL! I HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT YOU'RE MOVING TO CHARLESTON. HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS? YEAH. WILL GOT A REALLY GREAT JOB OUT THERE. JUST, IT'S ALL HAPPENING SO FAST. THIS IS GONNA CRUSH THE MAYOR. YOU'RE HIS RIGHT ARM. AND HIS LEFT ARM. MAYBE EVEN A LEG. HE'S NOT VERY HAPPY. OH, ACTUALLY, NOW THAT I HAVE YOU HERE... YOU KNOW EVERYONE IN TOWN. A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER IS ONLY AS GOOD AS HER VOLUNTEERS. EXACTLY, SO IF YOU COULD THINK OF ANYONE THAT MIGHT BE A REALLY GREAT REPLACEMENT FOR ME... NO ONE COULD EVER REPLACE YOU, BUT I'LL PUT ON MY THINKING CAP. SO WE'LL HANG OUT SOON! YES, FOR SURE. - OKAY. - BYE. HI. HOW ARE YOU? CAN I GET A BLUEBERRY? THANK YOU! HEY, DANIEL! I LOVE IT WHEN YOU GET CREATIVE WITH YOUR BOOTH. WELL, I LOVE FARM-FRESH FOOD FAIR! WHERE ARE THE DONATIONS GOING THIS MONTH? THE SOCCER TEAM AT THE GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL. THEY NEED NEW UNIFORMS. WELL, THEY CAN REST EASY, KNOWING THAT AIMIE ROARKE IS ON THE CASE. IS THIS OFFICIAL PARKS AND REC BUSINESS? NO. WELL, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU FIND THE TIME FOR SO MANY CAUSES. OR THE ENERGY. I WAS TAUGHT ONE PERSON CAN CHANGE THE WORLD, ONE GOOD DEED AT A TIME. THANKS FOR THE SIGNATURE, DANIEL. MY PLEASURE. HEY, BECKY! HEY, AIMIE! OH, YOU NEED TO TRY THIS. OOH... WAIT, WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT SPICY? JALAPENO, PUMPKIN, HAZELNUT. THAT IS SO GOOD. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS FOR THE FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL. OH, I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU ON THAT. OUR NEW PASTRY CHEF IS A GENIUS. AND HE'S CUTE! I WANT TO SET YOU UP WITH HIM. BECKY, YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DATE. OH, COME ON! WOULDN'T YOUR LIFE BE RICHER IF YOU SHARED IT WITH SOMEONE? OH, HEY, WOULD YOU SIGN THIS FOR ME? I DO SHARE MY LIFE WITH SOMEONE... EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, AND YOU KNOW IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LISTEN, SURE, IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE IN LOVE, BUT LOVE ISN'T A STOP SIGN AT THE CORNER OF AZURE AND SPRUCE. YOU LOST ME. LOVE CAN'T BE FORCED! IT HAPPENS WHEN IT HAPPENS. BUT STOP SIGNS NEED PETITIONS, SO... I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE BREW! OKAY, FINE. GIVE ME THAT. I LOVE THAT YOU WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD, AIMIE, BUT I JUST CAN'T DROP EVERYTHING EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO SAVE IT. WHAT? I DID... I DIDN'T HEAR YOU THAT. I'LL SEE YOU AT THE FIRST MEETING. I'M GONNA GO SAY HI TO MY MOM'S KNITTING CLUB. ARE YOU LOST? OH, NO. I'M JUST ADMIRING YOUR TREE OVER THERE. IT IS A BEAUTY. OH, THE BIG OLD TREE'S A LOT MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL. SHE'S GOT BRAINS, TOO. AS TREES GO, SHE TOTALLY PASSES "THE BECHDEL TEST." KYLE SORENSEN. AIMIE ROARKE. ARE YOU NEW TO TOWN? NOT TO BE NOSY, BUT I WORK FOR THE PARKS AND REC DEPARTMENT. WE'RE DOING THIS BIG TOURISM PUSH. I'M ACTUALLY JUST PASSING THROUGH. PASSING THROUGH COUNTS AS TOURISM. HERE FOR WORK, ACTUALLY. OH. WELL, LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT AMPLE HILLS. IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE. Y-YOU CALLED HER "THE BIG OLD TREE." IS THAT 'CAUSE SHE'S BIG AND OLD? IT'S NOT THE MOST CREATIVE NAME. NO, IT'S GOOD. TO THE POINT, YOU KNOW? WHY DRESS THINGS UP IN FANCY TERMS WHEN SIMPLE DOES THE TRICK, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND, UH... NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. SORENSEN. WELCOME TO AMPLE HILLS. ENJOY IT. THANKS. I WILL. AND IT'S KYLE. KYLE. HEY THERE! YOU ALL HAVING A FANTASTIC FARM-FRESH FOOD FAIR? YOU ORGANIZED A GREAT FAIR, AND POINTS FOR THE ALLITERATION. SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE ENGLISH TEACHER. RETIRED ENGLISH TEACHER. HEY, HON'! HEY, MOM! OH! SO DO YOU LOVE OUR SHADY SPOT? MM-HMM. YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR YOUR DAD'S DEDICATION. I'M KIND OF HUNGRY. DO YOU WANT SOME CHILI? BUT THEN SHAZ SAID THAT THIS TREE'S NOT GONNA BE HERE THAT MUCH LONGER, AND I REALLY DO WANT A SHADY SPOT FOR HIS TRIBUTE. SO I'M THINKING MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT IN FRONT OF HIS OLD OFFICE. MOM, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR DAD'S DEDICATION. AND I'M THINKING MAYBE IT SHOULD BE MORE THAN A PLAQUE. NO, WHY IS THE TREE NOT GONNA BE HERE? YOU DON'T KNOW? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DON'T I KNOW? HONEY, THEY'RE CUTTING THE TREE DOWN. WE HEARD IT'S HAPPENING NEXT WEEK. THEY CAN'T CUT IT DOWN. I KNOW YOU LOVE THE TREE. I LOVE THE TREE. WE ALL LOVE IT. BUT THE MAYOR, OH, HE IS DEAD-SET AGAINST KEEPING THIS TREE BECAUSE... ANYTHING PARK-RELATED HAS TO COME THROUGH MY OFFICE! I'M GONNA GO GIVE THE MAYOR A PIECE OF MY MIND. A BIG PIECE! THANK YOU. HEY, SHERIFF. - AIMIE. - BECKY. I NEED MY BOX OF FRITTERS. STAT. WHAT HAPPENED? IT'S BIG. IT'S HUGE. THEY'RE CUTTING DOWN THE BIG OLD TREE. ISN'T IT AN HISTORICAL LANDMARK? WILL BE, WHEN I'M DONE WITH IT. WHAT'S UP, AL? MR. PENDERSON. THANKS. I NEED TO SEE HIM, TEAL. NO. FRITTERS WON'T WORK THIS TIME. HE TOLD YOU NOT TO LET ME IN? HIS EXACT WORDS WERE "NOT IF SHE'S IN HURRICANE AIMIE MODE." THIS IS "TROPICAL DEPRESSION AIMIE." HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE "HURRICANE AIMIE." HE CAN'T HANDLE "HURRICANE AIMIE." MAYBE TRY, LIKE, A "LIGHT BREEZE AIMIE"? WE NEED TO TALK. TEAL? WHAT DID I TELL YOU? I TRIED. I CAN HEAR YOU EATING THE FRITTER FROM HERE. SHOW A LITTLE BACKBONE. SORRY! WELL, YOU USUALLY SAVE YOUR PETITIONS FOR THE WEEKLY TOWN HALL MEETINGS. THIS ISN'T ABOUT A PETITION. MAN, YOU MAKE THIS JOB INTERESTING. IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE INTERESTING. I JUST HEARD YOU'RE PLANNING ON UPROOTING THE HEART OF OUR TOWN. IT'S A LIABILITY TO THIS COMMUNITY. THAT TREE IS OUR COMMUNITY, TOM. WELL, I PREFER... - MAYOR PARKER. - PLEASE. WE WENT TO SENIOR PROM TOGETHER, IN CASE YOU FORGOT. HOW COULD I FORGET? YOU TRIED TO SPIN ME AND I FACE-PLANTED. DON'T BLAME YOUR LACK OF RHYTHM ON ME. I DON'T HAVE... YOU WERE TRYING TO LEAD. I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAD. YOU SHOULD'VE CHECKED WITH MY DEPARTMENT ON THE BIG OLD TREE. WE NEED THAT TREE. WOULD YOU SAY THAT WE NEED WATER, TOO? OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED WATER! OKAY, THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE ROOTS HAVE BEEN WREAKING HAVOC ON THE MUNICIPAL PLUMBING LINES. WELL, THAT'S A FIXABLE THING. WE HAVE BEEN FIXING IT. FOR YEARS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO ANYMORE. A REMOVAL SERVICE HAS BEEN HIRED. WHICH ONE? IS IT GORDON'S GREENERY? IT'S GORDON'S GREENERY, ISN'T IT? IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. LOOK, YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO THE BIG OLD TREE BECAUSE IT HAS TO GO. I'M NOT SAYING GOODBYE, BECAUSE I'M CHANGING YOUR MIND. OH, YOUR PASSION IS ADMIRABLE AS ALWAYS, AIMIE, BUT MY DECISION IS FIRM. WELL, SO IS MY RESOLVE. SUPER-FIRM. THE FIRMEST. SEE HOW FIRMLY I PICKED UP MY CLIPBOARD? YEAH, I NOTICED. AIMIE ROARKE, PARKS AND RECREATION. KYLE SORENSEN, "JUST PASSING THROUGH." FANCY SEEING YOU AGAIN. MUST BE FATE. OH, I THINK MORE "SMALL-TOWN STATUS QUO" THAN FATE, BUT NICE TO SEE YOU. WELL, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WOULD INTERACT IN COFFEE SHOPS, BUT NOW WE JUST BURY OUR HEADS IN OUR SCREENS. TSK. AND HOW, DARE I ASK, DO YOU AVOID THE TEMPTATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY? BY FORGETTING TO CHARGE MY DEVICES, THEN I AM FORCED TO JUST ENJOY THE WORLD AROUND ME. THAT SOUNDS INEFFICIENT, BUT INTERESTING. YOU KNOW WHAT? I MISS INTERACTING AT COFFEE SHOPS. DOES IT COUNT AS INTERACTING IF YOU'RE INTERACTING ABOUT THE ACT OF INTERACTING? SURE. INTERACTING'S INTERACTING. WELL, NOW IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A WORD. "INTERACTING." IT DOESN'T. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOESN'T. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY... I'M ON A DEADLINE, SO I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING ONLINE... EXCEPT THE THING I NEED. AND WHAT'S THAT? I GOTTA FIND OUT WHICH LANDSCAPING COMPANY MAYOR PARKER HIRED TO CUT DOWN THE BIG OLD TREE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GORDON'S GREENERY, BUT TOM WOULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY. SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU FIND OUT? UGH. PROBABLY CALL THEM HEARTLESS, MONEY-GRUBBING MONSTERS DESTROYING THE FABRIC OF OUR TOWN. I MIGHT BE LESS DRAMATIC. IT DEPENDS ON MY MOOD. WELL, IT'S NOT GORDON'S GREENERY. THEY CAN'T HANDLE A JOB OF THAT SIZE. HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE I CAN HANDLE A JOB OF THAT SIZE, WHICH IS WHY MAYOR PARKER HIRED ME. YOU'RE THE GUY MAYOR PARKER HIRED? I PREFER "HEARTLESS, MONEY-GRUBBING MONSTER." YOU CAN'T CUT DOWN MY TREE. YOUR TREE? WELL, IT BELONGS TO THE TOWN, I LIVE IN THE TOWN, THEREFORE, IT'S PARTLY MINE. THE TREE BELONGS TO THE CITY, WHICH IS WHO HIRED ME, WHICH IS WHY YOU CAN'T TELL ME NOT TO DO MY JOB. WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T RIGHT. YOU'RE USED TO GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, AREN'T YOU? I'M A POSITIVE FORCE FOR GOOD. PLEASE DON'T BE SELF-RIGHTEOUS. PLEASE DON'T BE A JERK. I'M NOT SELF-RIGHTEOUS. I'M A LEADER. I THINK YOU MEAN "CONTROL FREAK." EVERYTHING I DO, I DO FOR MY TOWN. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT ASKING THE PEOPLE OF YOUR TOWN IF THEY WANT YOUR HELP? WELL, NO, BECAUSE I KNOW. LOOK, I'M NOT LETTING YOU BULLY ME OUT OF A CITY CONTRACT SO YOU CAN SAVE YOUR FAVORITE PICNIC SPOT. I AM NOT A BULLY, I'M A RALLY-ER. I RALLY! THE TREE IS CAUSING PROBLEMS. I WAS HIRED TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS, SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, WE'RE DONE. OH, I'LL EXCUSE YOU, BUT WE'RE NOT DONE. BELIEVE ME, WHEN WE'RE DONE, YOU'LL WISH YOU WERE "JUST PASSING THROUGH" KYLE SORENSEN. I'M UP, I'M UP. I MEAN, COME UP. I MEAN, COME IN. COME IN. HI. SLEEPING AT THE OFFICE IS SO NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH, YOU KNOW. SLEEPING? WHO SAID I WAS SLEEPING? YOU HAVE DESK HEAD. YEAH, I SLEPT A LITTLE BIT. COME ON IN. DO YOU HAVE SLOGANS? LAY 'EM ON ME. WE'RE ON A DEADLINE. WHEN'S OUR DEADLINE? BY THE FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL. IN TWO WEEKS. RIGHT. OKAY, THE BEST ONE I HAVE SO FAR IS... "WHEN IT COMES TO FRIENDSHIP, WE'VE GOT AMPLE." BUT I'M NOT SOLD. WHAT? I WASN'T LISTENING. SAY IT AGAIN. DO IT AGAIN. I'M ON IT. GO. PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS? OH. I NEED MORE THAN A PENNY. LARRY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? IT'S A COFFEE SHOP, SO I PLANNED ON COFFEE. MIND IF I JOIN YOU? YES. OH. OKAY. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. NO, I MEAN YES. YES, YES. NO, PLEASE, JOIN ME. WELL, THAT'S A LOT BETTER. I THOUGHT I MIGHT'VE BEEN DISTURBING SOME THINGS HERE. NO, I CAN USE THE DISTRACTIONS. GOOD MORNING, LIEUTENANT. CAN YOU BELIEVE THE MAYOR'S TRYING TO CUT DOWN OUR TREE? I KNOW, I'M SPEECHLESS, TOO, BUT DON'T WORRY, NOT GONNA LET IT HIM. WELL, I'M SORRY, MRS. ROARKE, BUT YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN A SECOND MORTGAGE, AND, WELL, YOU'VE MISSED SEVERAL PAYMENTS. NO, NOT MISSED. NO, JUST DELAYED. IT'S JUST... YEAH. IS THERE ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP? FAMILY, OR... OR AN EMPLOYER? WELL, I RETIRED RIGHT BEFORE MY HUSBAND HAD HIS HEART ATTACK, AND THEN... WELL, WE STARTED RENOVATING THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS WHY WE TOOK OUT THE SECOND MORTGAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND THEN... WE NEVER FINISHED THE RENOVATIONS. WE DIDN'T FINISH A LOT OF THINGS. I'M SORRY, MA'AM. ALL RIGHT. LET'S STEM THE TIDE OF BOTANICAL INJUSTICE. YOU MEAN HAND OUT FLYERS. EXACTLY. OH! HEY, GUYS. I NEED YOU! TONIGHT, 5:00 P.M. - LOVE THAT TREE. - AWESOME, AIMIE. OH, HEY! YOU LIKE OLD THINGS. HELP ME SAVE THE OLDEST THING IN TOWN. THANKS, AIMIE. HI, HI. 5:00 P.M., RALLY AT CITY HALL. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA GO HIT UP THAT MOM. DO IT. WELL... IF IT ISN'T MY NEMESIS. I AM NOT YOUR NEMESIS. OH, THAT'S TRUE. MAYOR PARKER IS MY NEMESIS. YOU'RE JUST MY NEMESIS-IN-WAITING. LADY, I'M JUST DOING MY JOB. I'M NOT A "LADY." I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, TECHNICALLY, I'M A LADY, YES, BUT DON'T SAY IT LIKE I'M A RANDOM STRANGER. YOU ARE. I BARELY KNOW YOU. AND YET YOU CALLED ME SELF-RIGHTEOUS. YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT WAS UNGENTLEMANLIKE. I'M SORRY. OH, LOOK. HERE'S A RESPONSIBLE YOUNG MAN, WEARING A HELMET. SIR! HELP ME BE RESPONSIBLE AND SAVE THE TR... OKAY, GOOD TALK. I'LL SEE YOU THERE. HMM. AHEM. HE LOVES ME. I'VE GOT THE WHOLE TOWN ON MY SIDE. THIS IS A GREAT TREE, BUT THE ROOTS ARE CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PIPES, AND IT'S GOT TO GO. JUST BEING HONEST. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M JUST BEING HONEST. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN. BOOM. MIC DROP. YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT TALKING TRASH. YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT RECOGNIZING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN. AH. I SHOULD GO. LEAVE AMPLE HILLS? GOOD IDEA! WE SHOULD HIT THE REST OF THE SQUARE, AS PEOPLE LEAVE FROM WORK. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. THAT'S PRETTY IRONIC, YOU HANDING OUT PAPER TO SAVE A TREE. OH, IT'S NOT REAL PAPER. MADE OF CORNS HUSKS. OH. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? PICKED UP THE MIC AND THEN I DROPPED IT AGAIN. DOUBLE-BOOM! DOUBLE-BOOM. OKAY. MAYBE WE WEREN'T CLEAR ABOUT WHAT TIME IT STARTS. WE TOLD EVERYONE 5:00 P.M. MOM, DID YOU SEE ANYONE OUTSIDE? THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE. THIS TOWN LOVES YOU, HONEY, BUT YOU ASK A LOT. ONLY WHAT I'M WILLING TO DO MYSELF. NOT EVERYBODY'S YOU. MAYOR PARKER. OH, NOW IT'S MAYOR PARKER? HUH. YEAH, EARLIER IT WAS STILL TOM, YOUR OLD PROM DATE. NO, YOU'RE NOT TOM ANYMORE. THAT GUY WAS MY FRIEND. I AM YOUR FRIEND. I CAME TO SEE HOW MUCH SUPPORT YOU HAVE. ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T COME TO GLOAT ABOUT MY LACK OF SUPPORT? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOUR RALLY WAS A BUST UNTIL I GOT HERE. OKAY, SO NOW YOU'RE CALLING IT A BUST. I WANT TO HELP YOU. I DO. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK. AND I DON'T SEE HOW THAT HELPS ME. AIMIE, WAIT. I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER. AIMIE... HONEY, I... I KNOW YOUR HISTORY WITH THE TREE. I GET... I GET HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOU, BUT... HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT MAYBE YOU'RE SPREADING YOURSELF TOO THIN WITH ALL THESE CAUSES? BECAUSE YOU... AIMIE. LOOK AT ME. MOM, WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN? NO, I'M NOT SAYING LOSE THAT. I'M JUST SAYING WHY DON'T YOU CHANNEL THIS PASSION INTO YOUR REAL LIFE? THIS IS MY REAL LIFE. BABY, YOU'RE STUCK. INSTEAD OF USING YOUR PASSION TO MOVE YOUR LIFE FORWARD, YOU'RE LETTING IT... YOU'RE LETTING IT ROOT YOU IN PLACE. AND WE BOTH KNOW WHY. MOM, PLEASE DON'T. YOU JUST GO, GO, GO, EVER SINCE DAD DIED, AND... IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED DEALING WITH YOUR GRIEF YET. I'M FINE, MOM, REALLY. IF YOU'RE SO FINE, WHY DO YOU KEEP CHANGING THE SUBJECT EVERY TIME I BRING UP HIS DEDICATION IN THE PARK, HUH? CAN WE PLEASE NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW? OKAY. BUT YOU SHOULD STOP DISTRACTING YOURSELF WITH CAUSES AND YOU SHOULD START TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF. THAT'S AN EPIC AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK. I CAN EXPEDITE THE HISTORICAL LANDMARK APPLICATION PROCESS. IT JUST REQUIRES A LOT OF FORMS. HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WASN'T ALREADY A HISTORICAL LANDMARK. I GUESS NO ONE EVER ACTS UNTIL THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO. THAT'S WHY NO ONE CAME YESTERDAY. WHAT? INSTEAD OF ASKING PEOPLE FOR HELP, YOU MAKE US FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO. I DON'T DO THAT. DO I DO THAT? AIMIE. I WANTED TO SLEEP IN TODAY, BUT INSTEAD, I'M FILLING OUT FORMS, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I HAD NO CHOICE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP ME? I'M YOUR BFF, I LOVE HELPING YOU, BUT THE REST OF THE TOWN MIGHT NEED A LESS-GUILT-INDUCING APPROACH. I NEED HELP, BUT I'M TRYING TO BE MORE AWARE OF HOW I ASK FOR IT. DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO BED? AND DENY MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF FILLING OUT FORMS UNTIL MY HAND'S CRAMPED? NOT A CHANCE. YOU'RE THE BEST. HEY ANGELA, CAN I INTERVIEW YOU? I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF CONNECTION WITH THE BIG OLD TREE? OH... WE HAD ETHAN'S FIRST BIRTHDAY THERE. AND HIS SECOND, AND HIS THIRD, AND HIS FOURTH. HE CALLS IT HIS "GROWING SPOT." ISN'T THAT SWEET? VERY. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE YOUR STORY TONIGHT AT 5:00 P.M.? SURE. MY GRANDSON, GUS, TOOK HIS FIRST STEP AT THE BIG OLD TREE. HE WAS KIND OF HANGING ONTO IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, BRACING HIMSELF, AND THEN, SUDDENLY, HE JUST PUSHED HIMSELF OFF, AND HE WAS WALKING. I LIKE TO SIT AT THE VETERAN'S STATUE AND READ. I ALWAYS HAVE. BEFORE I MET MY HUSBAND, HE'D SEE ME THERE. HE WAS ALWAYS NERVOUS. FINALLY, HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF. TWO YEARS LATER, JOHN PROPOSED, AT THE TREE. HE SAID, "THIS IS WHERE WE MET." IT'S WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER." WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THE OUTCOME OF YOUR LITTLE RALLY AFFECTS MY WORK, SO... I'M HERE. THIS RALLY IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMPLE HILLS. I'M A PERSON OF AMPLE HILLS WHILE I'M IN AMPLE HILLS. YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU COULD BE A MEMBER OF OUR TOWN. SOMETIMES, PEOPLE DISAPPOINT YOU. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER. PROBABLY BEST TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. THE VISUAL AIDS YOU REQUESTED. OH, I LOVE THEM. THANK YOU. WILL YOU HOLD MY BAG? SURE. OH, HOW'S THIS FOR A SLOGAN... "HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, AMPLE HILLS." TOO CASABLANCA. YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR COMING. UM, I KNOW THIS CAUSE IS REALLY PERSONAL TO ALL OF YOU, SO LET'S GO SHOW THE MAYOR! CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD IGNITE THE TOWN LIKE THIS. ARE YOU HERE TO SUPPORT HER, OR ARE YOU ON OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS? CAN I SAY BOTH? SHE SENT ME A TEXT, SO I CAME OVER TO MAKE SURE THINGS STAYED ORDERLY, BUT I SUPPORT HER CAUSE. I LIKE THAT ANSWER. GOOD. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU GUYS CAN'T COME IN HERE WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. WE HAVE PROTOCOL, PEOPLE. TEAL, I'M IN HURRICANE AIMIE MODE. STEP ASIDE. NO, AIMIE. HE CAN'T SEE YOU NOW. I OWE YOU MORE FRITTERS, I PROMISE. NO. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THIS TIME, OKAY? HE'S UNAVAILABLE. HOP UP ON THE BENCH. GET UP ON THE BENCH. LET ME HELP YOU UP. WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, TOM PARKER. THIS IS SO NOT HOW I EXPECTED MY LAST WEEK ON THE JOB TO GO. WE'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU SHOW YOURSELF. AM I RIGHT? IS THERE A MEETING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT? THE BIG OLD TREE IS OUR TOWN. IT'S A WINDOW TO OUR PAST AND A GUIDEPOST TO OUR FUTURE. NOW, I DIDN'T MAKE ANY OF YOU JOIN THIS FIGHT. EVERYONE IS HERE BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE BIG OLD TREE. SAVE OUR TREE! SAVE OUR TREE! SAVE OUR TREE! - FOR GUS. - FOR GUS. AND FOR JOHN. AND FOR ETHAN. AND FOR ALL OF AMPLE HILLS! I APPRECIATE THE PASSION I'M SEEING, I DO, BUT THE BIG OLD TREE IS COSTING US AN ARM AND A LEG TO MAINTAIN, SO, I'M SORRY, BUT, AS OF TOMORROW, IT HAS TO BE REMOVED. NO! MAKE THIS STOP, AIMIE. OH, I'M JUST GETTING STARTED. I WANT ALL OF YOU TO EMAIL TOM PARKER. AND IF HE IGNORES YOUR EMAILS, I WANT YOU TO WRITE REAL LETTERS, OR CALL HIS OFFICE, EXPRESS YOUR OPINION. SEND CARRIER PIGEONS, IF YOU HAVE TO. MAKE HIM HEAR YOU. IT IS SO ON. IT IS SO NOT ON. EMAILS WON'T HELP, LETTERS WON'T HELP, PHONE CALLS WON'T... WHY DID I SAY THAT THING ABOUT CARRIER PIGEONS? WHY DID I THINK I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE? YOU NEED TO RELAX. DID YOU JUST TAKE THAT OUT OF YOUR BAG? IT'S MY EMERGENCY WINE. WHAT? YOU JUST CARRY IT WITH YOU? EMERGENCIES ARE EMERGENCIES, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE COMING. ALL RIGHT. YOU CONVINCED ME. I SHOULD BE CONFIDENT. I HAVE THE WHOLE TOWN ON MY SIDE. BUT I'M OUT OF TIME. YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING MEMORABLE. SOMETHING THAT WILL FORCE MAYOR PARKER TO PAY ATTENTION. WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS ASK ME? "WHAT'S OUR GOAL?" YOUR GOAL IS TO CHANGE THE MAYOR'S MIND ABOUT CUTTING DOWN THE TREE. YEAH. I NEED TO LOCK HIM INTO A DIFFERENT PLAN. WAIT, THAT'S IT. CAN YOU COVER FOR ME TOMORROW? SURE. BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - I NEED THIS. - NO. MINE. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T BE HERE. THIS IS A PUBIC PARK AND I'M A PUBLIC PERSON. ALL VALID POINTS, BUT THIS AREA IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED WHILE WE FINISH CUTTING DOWN YOUR... DON'T EVEN SAY IT. YOU'RE NOT CUTTING THE TREE. OH, BUT I AM, BECAUSE I AM A MAN OF MY WORD. FINE. BE A MAN OF YOUR WORD. I PREFER TO BE A WOMAN OF ACTION. WISH ME LUCK, LIEUTENANT. MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH GUIDE ROPE FOR THE BRANCHES. THIS CANOPY IS AT LEAST A HUNDRED-FEET WIDE. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? I'M LOCKING MAYOR PARKER INTO MAKING A DIFFERENT CHOICE. YOU'RE LOCKING YOURSELF TO A TREE. SYMBOLIC AND EFFECTIVE. WIN-WIN. I'M JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB. NO ONE'S STOPPING YOU. YES, ACTUALLY, YOU ARE. LITERALLY. I'M STANDING UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO CUT DOWN THIS TREE, YOU'VE GOT TO CUT THROUGH ME. LITERALLY. YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. AT LEAST IT'S A SOLUTION. UNTIL I GET THE MAYOR TO CHANGE HIS MIND. IT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT ME FROM CUTTING DOWN THIS TREE. ARE YOU CUTTING IT DOWN RIGHT NOW? NOT PRESENTLY. THEN IT PREVENTED YOU. YOU JUST KEEP ON TALKING, DON'T YOU? I'M A PRETTY GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST. SO AM I, WHEN I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY. WATCH THIS. HELLO. THIS IS KYLE SORENSEN FOR MAYOR PARKER. WE HAVE OURSELVES A LITTLE PROBLEM. WATCH THIS, WATCH THIS. BECKY? HI. I DID SOMETHING A LITTLE RASH. YES, THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING YOUR SUPPORT. I'LL LET THE MAYOR KNOW. MAYOR PARKER'S OFFICE. YES, I UNDERSTAND, I'LL LET HIM KNOW YOU SUPPORT AIMIE AND THE TREE. GET THE SHERIFF ON THE LINE. I'LL TRY, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A CALL ALL MORNING. MAYOR PARKER'S OFFICE, PLEASE HOLD. EVERY TIME I HANG UP, IT RINGS. MAYOR PARKER'S OFFICE, HOLD PLEASE. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT. GET SHERIFF GARIBALDI TO THE PARK NOW. WOW, YOU ACTUALLY DID IT. YOU CHAINED YOURSELF TO THE TREE. DESPERATE TIMES, DESPERATE MEASURES. HEY, TREE KILLER! I WILL BEAT YOU TO A PULP IF YOU GO NEAR MY DAUGHTER WITH THAT HATCHET. I'M A PACIFIST, MA'AM. I ABHOR VIOLENCE. OH, NO, YOU DON'T, AL. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ARREST MY DAUGHTER, LARRY. BECKY! HELP ME! YOU'RE OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE, ZEE. OH, IS IT AGAINST THE LAW TO STAND HERE? HIGHER, BECKY, A LITTLE HIGHER. A LITTLE HIGHER, A LITTLE HIGHER. I CAN SEE WHERE SHE GETS HER SPUNK. OH, I'M FULL OF SURPRISES. OKAY... I WON'T BACK DOWN UNTIL THIS SITE IS OFFICIALLY NAMED AN OFFICIAL HISTORICAL LANDMARK. OKAY, AIMIE. ENOUGH FUN AND GAMES. I'M NOT COMING DOWN, SHERIFF. ZEE, TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER. I GAVE UP TRYING TO TALK SENSE INTO HER A LONG TIME AGO. YOU KNOW IT TAKES MONTHS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN HISTORICAL LANDMARK. I FILLED OUT THE EXPEDITED FORMS. OKAY. SO MONTHS TURNS INTO WEEKS, IF YOU'RE LUCKY. ARE YOU PREPARED TO STAY UP IN THAT TREE FOR WEEKS? IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. YEAH. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING BESIDES A JACKET? FOOD? WATER? UM, YEAH. OKAY, I'LL PREPARE SOME MEALS. AND I'LL BRING YOU CHANGES OF CLOTHES. AND IT GETS COLD OUT HERE AT NIGHT, SO I'LL BRING YOU SOME BLANKETS. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME. THANK YOU. YOU NEED A TREE HOUSE. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. I CAN GATHER WHAT YOU NEED FROM THE HARDWARE STORE. ALONG WITH CAMPING GEAR. A SLEEPING BAG, A LANTERN. YOU'RE A LIFE-SAVER, DANIEL. THANK YOU, SCOOTER GIRL. WHEN I GROW UP, I WANNA LIVE IN A TREE LIKE THAT LADY. OR BE PRESIDENT. "WHILE OFFICERS ARE TRYING TO TALK MS. ROARKE DOWN, AIMIE APPEARS ROOTED IN PLACE." WHOA. GO, AIMIE. TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER. AIMIE IS OUT SICK TODAY, SIR. SHE'S NOT SICK. TRUE. BUT SHE CALLED IN SICK, SO, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, SHE'S SICK. SICK OR NOT, THIS LITTLE STUNT OF HERS BETTER NOT GET IN THE WAY OF ANY OF HER DEADLINES. WE'VE ALREADY SENT YOU 40 TOWN SLOGAN SUGGESTIONS, AND EVEN THOUGH AIMIE'S OUT SICK, SHE'S STILL WORKING FROM HOME. YOU MEAN FROM THE TREE. HOT COFFEE TO GO, PLEASE. I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT. YOU'RE KIDDING YOURSELF IF YOU THINK THIS'LL ONLY TAKE A NIGHT. SHE IS PERSISTENT. AND STUBBORN. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING INTO POT-CALLING- THE-KETTLE-BLACK TERRITORY. I'M NOT STUBBORN. I'M PRINCIPLED. YOUR FRIEND, ON THE OTHER HAND... STOP RIGHT THERE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD. THIS ISN'T MY FIGHT. YEAH. EXACTLY. LOOK, SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT, OKAY? SHE JUST CAN'T STOP MOVING. SHE NEVER STOPS MOVING. I MEANT EMOTIONALLY. THEN SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HER CAUSES WHEN HER DAD DIED, BUT SHE JUST GOES AND GOES AND GOES. BUT BUSY DOES NOT MEAN MOVING. SO WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THIS? SO YOU SEE SHE ISN'T JUST SOME RANDOM GIRL IN A TREE WHO GOT IN YOUR WAY, SO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE COMES FROM. THANKS. HELLO, SHERIFF. - DEPUTY. - BECKY. HI, AIMIE. HI. I BROUGHT YOU SOME GOODIES. AND I'LL BAKE A CASSEROLE FOR YOU LATER TONIGHT, SO IT'LL LAST YOU THROUGH THE WEEK. THANK YOU. HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE UP THERE? AS LONG AS IT TAKES. WELL, I THINK IT'S INSPIRATIONAL. REALLY? THANK YOU. I'M ACTUALLY GETTING TOGETHER A LIST OF TREE-SITTERS RIGHT NOW. TREE-SITTERS? YEAH. I NEED VOLUNTEERS TO TREE-SIT SO THAT I CAN GO OUT AND SPREAD THE WORD. CAN I SIGN YOU UP?

I GOT TO UNLOAD THIS STUFF AND GET BACK TO THE SHOP. AIMIE? MY BACK'S REALLY HURTING SLEEPING ON THE CEMENT. AT MY AGE, I NEED A MATTRESS. YOU KNOW WHAT, SHERIFF, YOU CAN GO ON HOME. I'M STILL GONNA BE HERE TOMORROW WHEN YOU COME BACK. YEAH, I WAS AFRAID YOU'D SAY THAT. AL, TAKE OVER. SLEEP IN THE CAR IF YOU HAVE TO, STAY NEARBY. AND CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME, OKAY? HERE. THIS'LL MAKE THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CRUISER A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE. THANKS, KYLE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? A PREPARED MAN ALWAYS HAS MORE THAN ONE SLEEPING BAG. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, WELL. ZEE ROARKE, TWICE IN ONE DAY. HOW DID I GET TO BE SUCH A LUCKY MAN? DON'T GET ALL CHARMING WITH ME, LARRY. YOU TRIED TO ARREST MY DAUGHTER. IMAGINE THE HEADACHE SHE'D CAUSE IF I TOOK HER INTO THE STATION. I'D ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE HER ALONE. THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE HERE? TO TELL ME TO LEAVE AIMIE ALONE? YES. IF I WANTED TO ARREST YOUR DAUGHTER, I'D HAVE DONE IT. I'M NOT THE SMALL-TOWN BUMBLING SHERIFF YOU SEE ON TV. REALLY? THEN WHY IS DEPUTY AL HAVING A STAKEOUT AT THE TREE? TO MAKE SURE AIMIE'S SAFE. I CAN'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN AMPLE HILLS, CAN I? MAKE SURE HE'S SAFE. JUST DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP, OKAY? THANKS. OKAY. AND IF YOU WANT TO START FLIRTING AGAIN AFTER, YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING IS OVER... MAYBE I'LL FLIRT BACK. OKAY. THIS SHOULD WORK. HOW ARE YOU ANCHORING YOUR FOUNDATION? I'D SUGGEST YOU TIE THE BOARDS TO THE BRANCHES, USING DIAGONAL LASHINGS. IT'S HOW THEY BUILT THE LOG CABINS BACK IN THE DAY. AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO PRE-DRILL THESE 2X4S, OR YOU MIGHT SPLIT THE WOOD. YOU REALIZE HELPING HER'S ONLY GONNA MAKE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT FOR US, RIGHT? I CAN'T STAND POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP. I CAN DO THIS MYSELF. YOU CALL THAT A TREEHOUSE? I TOOK A MINIMALIST APPROACH. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT, FINE, IT'S A FIXER-UPPER. IT'S A PLATFORM. IT'S A CHARMING PLATFORM. THAT'S A STRETCH. YOU KNOW WHAT, KYLE SORENSEN? I'M ALL SETTLED IN HERE. YOU CAN GO HOME. I AM HOME. YOU LIVE IN THIS PARK? I LIVE THREE HOURS AWAY, SO I'M CAMPING OUT. DO YOU HAVE TO CAMP HERE? WHERE WOULD YOU PREFER I CAMP? YOSEMITE. YOSEMITE IS LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR, BUT THIS IS A FINE SPOT. PLUS, IT LETS ME BE HERE WHEN I'M NEEDED. ISN'T IT KINDA HYPOCRITICAL TO CAMP OUT UNDERNEATH THE TREE YOU'RE CUTTING DOWN? I'M JUST LIVING IN THE MOMENT. WANT AN APPLE? IS THAT A PEACE OFFERING? OR ARE YOU JUST LIVING IN THE MOMENT? SOMETIMES, AN APPLE IS JUST AN APPLE. YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD WITH THAT TENT. DO YOU CAMP A LOT? LATELY. WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEFORE? YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I'M A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST. I DIDN'T CAMP BECAUSE OF CHRISTINA. WHO? MY EX-GIRLFRIEND. AH... ANTI-CAMPING? "ANTI" A LOT OF THINGS. I MET MY EX, MATT, IN COLLEGE, AND WE MOVED TO WASHINGTON, D.C. THE PLACE TO CHANGE THE WORLD. BUT MATT SAW IT AS A PLACE TO CLIMB THE POLITICAL LADDER. AT ANY COST. SO YOU DECIDED TO MOVE HOME? YEAH. WANTED TO BE A BIG FISH IN A SMALL POND. I THINK I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN AMPLE HILLS. I CAN RESPECT THAT. I USED TO WORK IN A BANK. WEARING A SUIT AND TIE EVERY DAY JUST FELT LIKE A PRISON UNIFORM. CITY LIFE JUST ISN'T MY THING. I WANTED TO BE OUTDOORS MORE. YOU KNOW, WORK WITH MY HANDS. WHICH IS WHY I AM LIVING IN THE NOW, NOW. CAMPING JUST HELPS KEEP ME PRESENT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN LOVE THE OUTDOORS SO MUCH AND STILL WANT TO CUT DOWN THIS BEAUTIFUL OLD TREE. I WAS HIRED TO DO A JOB. AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS? YES, ACTUALLY. I WAITED A LONG TIME TO START MY OWN BUSINESS. WHY DOES THIS MEAN SO MUCH TO YOU ANYWAY? IT'S NOT JUST ME, IT'S THE WHOLE TOWN. I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT THE WHOLE TOWN. LOOK, WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY YOU AND I COULD BOTH BE ON THE SAME SIDE? I COULD RE-PURPOSE THE WOOD. TURN IT INTO BENCHES. YOU WOULDN'T BE SITTING UNDER THE TREE, BUT YOU COULD SIT ON IT. IT WOULD LIVE ON, IN A WAY. ARTISANAL FURNITURE? THAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT A GIVER-UPPER. SO YOU BETTER GIVE UP ON GETTING ME TO GIVE UP. HONEY? WE'RE HERE. OH, HI! THANK YOU FOR COMING! OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN. NO! BUT BE CAREFUL. OKAY. SO... WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO? DON'T LET HIM SEPARATE YOU FROM THE TREE, OR ELSE, HE'LL BE ABLE TO CUT IT DOWN. I'VE GOTTA SAY, I'M IMPRESSED BY YOUR DEDICATION, AIMIE. THANK YOU. SO, PROMISE ME ONE OF YOU WILL STAY CHAINED TO THE TREE AT ALL TIMES? WE'VE GOT THIS. I'LL GO FIRST. 'KAY. OKAY, HERE'S YOUR CHAIR. OKAY. NICE AND COMFORTABLE. MOM, WILL YOU ASSIST? WOW, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, DON'T YOU? LOOK AT THIS. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE? YES. THANKS, GUYS. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO GO GET US SOME SNACKS. OKAY. OKAY. SO THOSE WERE SPRUCE 2X4S, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR... RIGHT. AND THEY WERE JUST... THEY WERE KIND OF SPLINTERING, SO I NEED SOME WAY TO SMOOTH THEM OUT. THIS RIGHT HERE... I WILL BE RIGHT BACK. JUST ONE SECOND. OKAY. HEY! HEY. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. I NEEDED SUPPLIES. FOR WHAT? YOU'RE NOT CUTTING ANYTHING DOWN. I'M BUILDING A CHAIR... A FINELY-CRAFTED CHAIR, SO I'LL BE COMFORTABLE WHILE I WAIT FOR YOU TO GIVE UP. I NEVER GIVE UP. SO YOU'VE SAID. WHAT'S THAT FOR? MY TREEHOUSE. YOU MEAN YOUR TREE FLOOR? I'M GETTING SPLINTERS. ALSO, I WANT IT TO LOOK NICE. WELL, THAT'S SILICON CARBIDE, WHICH IS GREAT FOR SANDING METALS, BUT YOU'LL WANT TO USE GARNET. HE'S RIGHT. IT'S STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB, BUT IT WON'T RUIN THE CHARACTER OF THE WOOD. THIS COMING FROM A GUY WHO'S WILLING TO RUIN THE CHARACTER OF AN ENTIRE TREE? A MEDIUM-GRIT WORKS BEST, AND SAND IN A CIRCULAR MOTION. IT WILL LEAVE A NICE CLEAN FINISH, AND IT'S EASIER ON YOUR WRIST. HE'S RIGHT AGAIN. OKAY, DON'T TAKE HIS SIDE. HOW'S THE CIVIC STAND-OFF GOING? IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL. HOW ARE THINGS HERE? MAYOR PARKER'S ON A TEAR. HE REJECTED ALL OF OUR SLOGANS. I THINK HE'S PUNISHING US FOR YOU BEING IN THE TREE. OKAY. I'LL TALK TO HIM. YOU CAN TALK TO HIM TOMORROW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE'VE RECEIVED SO MANY LETTERS FROM SUPPORTERS, THAT I CAN'T EVEN FIND MY DESK. THE PHONE IS STILL RINGING. SO THE MAYOR HAS SCHEDULED A TOWN HALL MEETING FOR TOMORROW AT 10:00 A.M. WE DID IT! CAN YOU PLEASE TELL THE TOWN TO STOP CALLING THE OFFICE? PLEASE? PLEASE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'VE BEEN ABOUT... I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SELLING MY KNITWEAR ONLINE. I BET YOU COULD MAKE A FORTUNE. NOT QUITE. NO. I DID THE MATH. TO MAKE ENOUGH SWEATERS TO EVEN CATCH UP WITH MY MORTGAGE, I'D HAVE TO KNIT CONTINUOUSLY FOR THE NEXT 25 YEARS. OH. THAT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH. YEAH, I KNOW. OH, SHE'S COMING. JUST CHANGE THE SUBJECT, OKAY? YOU STILL HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER YET? WELL, YOU LOOK HAPPY. WHAT HAPPENED? WE HAVE A MEETING AT CITY HALL TOMORROW. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. GREAT, GREAT. MOM, DID YOU BRING MY TREE POSTERS HOME AFTER THE LAST RALLY? YEAH. WILL YOU BRING THEM TOMORROW MORNING? CONSIDER IT DONE. PERFECT. THERE'S A HANDRAIL. WHO PUT A HANDRAIL UP ON MY TREE HOUSE? WHO DO YOU THINK PUT A HANDRAIL ON YOUR TREEHOUSE? DID YOU PUT A HANDRAIL ON MY TREEHOUSE? THE PLYWOOD WASN'T SAFE. WELL, IT'S A FIXER-UPPER, BUT IT'S FINE. NOW IT IS. I MAY FIND YOU INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. WELL, THANK YOU... I THINK. YOU'RE WELCOME, I THINK. HAVE YOU LOOKED AWAY FROM YOUR PHONE TO SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL SUNSET? I HAVE WORK TO DO. DO YOU EVER TAKE A BREAK? NOPE. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, PEOPLE DO THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO, NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. YOU ARE DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. IF I DON'T, WHO WILL? EXACTLY. YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO. IT'S IN YOUR NATURE. YOU'RE LIKE THE APICAL MERISTEM. IT'S A BOTANICAL TERM. DID YOU JUST INSULT ME WITH BOTANY? THE OPPOSITE, ACTUALLY. THE APICAL MERISTEM IS THE PART OF THE TREE WHERE GROWTH HAPPENS. THE VERY TOP. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TREE. IF YOU REMOVE IT, THE TREE STOPS GROWING AND IT DIES. YOU ARE THE APICAL MERISTEM OF THIS TOWN. IT NEEDS YOU. NO ONE'S EVER CALLED ME AN APICAL MERISTEM BEFORE. - GOOD MORNING. - GOOD MORNING. ALL RIGHT, DON'T BE MAD, BUT I FORGOT YOUR TREE POSTERS. WHAT? NO, I NEED VISUAL AIDS. WELL, JUST PICK THEM UP ON YOUR WAY OVER. I CAN'T. I WAS GONNA GO HOME AND SHOWER. I CAN'T SHOW UP TO CITY HALL LOOKING LIKE I SLEPT IN A TREE. WELL, JUST SHOWER AND CHANGE AT MY HOUSE. COME ON. CHAIN ME UP. SUE'S SHIFT STARTS AT 10:00. WHERE'S YOUR CAR? I WALKED. I HAD TO GET IN MY STEPS. MOM, THERE'S NO TIME FOR ME TO WALK ALL THE WAY THERE AND THEN BACK TO CITY HALL. I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO QUESTION YOUR MOTIVATION, SO LET'S JUST GO. I'LL BE REALLY QUICK. NO WORRIES. - OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN. - OKAY. OKAY, LET'S GO. YOU LOOK VERY PUT-TOGETHER. I'D BE OFFENDED IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS YOUR IDEA OF A COMPLIMENT. YOU TWO WERE VERY CLOSE. YEAH. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT ABOUT A PARENT. THAT'S TRUE. NOT SURE I COULD. YOU'RE LUCKY. I WAS LUCKY. YOU STILL ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU AVOID EMOTION? WELL, IN MY CASE, YOU END UP STAYING IN CHICAGO IN A TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP, AND I ALMOST MISSED OUT ON AMAZING THINGS LIKE CAMPING IN AMPLE HILLS. I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU HOW TO FEEL, BUT... FEEL WHAT YOU NEED TO FEEL. CAN WE GO TO CITY HALL, PLEASE? SURE. MAYOR PARKER'S 10 MINUTES LATE. IT'S A POWER MOVE. HE'S TRYING TO GET IN MY HEAD. I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM. HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M ON REFRESHMENT DUTY. NO, YOU'RE ON TREE DUTY. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO RELIEVE MY MOM AT 10:00. OKAY, OKAY, DON'T PANIC. I'M SURE YOUR MOM'S STILL THERE WAITING FOR ME. MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WAS LOOKING FOR SUE. YOU LEFT THE TREE UNMANNED? JUST FOR A FEW MINUTES. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST CALL SUE? I DID, BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER. I'M SORRY. IT'S MY FAULT. I WAS MAKING VANILLA VANILLA. I'LL HEAD OVER THERE RIGHT NOW. NO, NO. I HAVE TO DO IT. PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE TOO LATE, PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE TOO LATE. PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE TOO LATE... ALL RIGHT, GUYS, BE SURE TO KEEP THE GUIDE-LINES TAUT. WE NEED THIS TREE TO FALL EXACTLY WHERE WE PLANNED. LET'S GET THIS DONE. OH... GOODY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YOU CAN TELL YOUR BOYS TO GO HOME. PACK IT UP, FELLAS. FALSE ALARM. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? NO ONE RESPECTS TOOLS LIKE THEY USED TO, HUH? DON'T TALK TO THE LIEUTENANT LIKE HE'S ON YOUR SIDE. HE'S ON MY SIDE. AIMIE TAUGHT YOU THE FRITTER TRICK? I NEED TO SEE HIM. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. AIMIE MISSED THAT MEETING BECAUSE OF ME. I'D HATE TO THINK THAT SHE MIGHT LOSE BECAUSE OF MY MISTAKE. ZEE, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY THAT AIMIE HASN'T ALREADY SAID. HAS SHE TOLD YOU THAT THE BIG OLD TREE WAS PLANTED ON NOVEMBER 17, 1877, BY JEROME AND MADELYN PENDLETON, TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH OF THEIR DAUGHTER, REBECCA, WHO ENDED UP BEING THE FIRST FEMALE TEACHER AT AMPLE HILLS HIGH? NO. SHE HASN'T TOLD ME THAT. REBECCA WAS A SUFFRAGETTE. SHE MADE THIS TOWN BETTER. JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTER DOES. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. YOU PROBABLY ALSO DON'T KNOW THAT AIMIE AND HER DAD WOULD HAVE... WOULD HAVE LUNCH EVERY WEEK UNDER THE SHADE OF THAT TREE. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT, DID YOU? OF COURSE. SHE'S NOT ONE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE CARVED HIS INITIALS ON THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AFTER HE DIED. I MEAN, THAT TREE HAS ROOTS IN EVERY GENERATION IN THIS TOWN. DO YOU BELIEVE IN AMPLE HILLS, TOM? OF COURSE I DO, ZEE. THEN RESCHEDULE THAT MEETING WITH MY DAUGHTER. PLEASE. THAT MEETING WAS GONNA BE LEGENDARY. HIGH-SCHOOL KIDS WOULD HAVE STUDIED MY SPEECH IN THEIR MOCK DEBATE CLUBS. DO YOU WANT TO DO YOUR SPEECH TO ME? I CAN PRETEND TO BE MAYOR PARKER AND SAY "NO" A BUNCH. THANKS, BUT I THINK I'LL JUST WALLOW IN DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. OKAY. CALL ME IF YOU WANT TO KEEP VENTING. NO! NO MORE VENTING. I'M OVER-VENTED. I'LL RALLY TOMORROW. 'KAY. BYE. BYE. 'NIGHT. CAN YOU FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE YOUR PLACE UP THERE TONIGHT? WHY? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO GO OUT TO DINNER. WITH ME. WHAT'S YOUR ANGLE? NO ANGLE. JUST THOUGHT YOU COULD USE A NIGHT OFF. WELL, I'M THE ONLY TREE-SITTER ON DUTY TONIGHT, SO... NO. I FIGURED YOU MIGHT SAY THAT. WHAT IF I BRING THE "NIGHT OFF" TO YOU? WHO ARE YOU, KYLE SORENSEN? LOOK, THE WAY I SEE IT, WALLOWING IN DISAPPOINTMENT ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU FIND CLARITY, AND IT'S JUST GENERALLY NO FUN. YOU'VE GOT THIS GREAT BIG TREE HERE, JUST BEGGING FOR YOU TO HAVE A PICNIC UNDER ITS BRANCHES. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I SAY YES. BUT I'M NOT SURE MY CHAIN WILL EXTEND THAT FAR. I THOUGHT OF THAT, TOO. I'VE GOT EXTRA CHAIN IN MY TRUCK. DID YOU REALLY JUST OFFER TO EXTEND MY CHAIN SO WE COULD HAVE DINNER TOGETHER? GUESS I DID. - KETCHUP AND MUSTARD. - THANK YOU. YOU'RE CHEERS-ING YOURSELF. HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR. WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA LEARN ABOUT YOU TONIGHT? THAT YOU CAN TRUST THAT I'M NOT GONNA CUT DOWN YOUR TREE WHILE WE EAT. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT FAIRY LIGHTS WERE STANDARD-ISSUE LANDSCAPING TOOLS. I USE THEM FOR CAMPING. THEY'RE ODDLY ROMANTIC. IS THAT YOUR THING? ROMANTIC CAMPING? ROMAMPING? NO. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU COUNT MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE GREAT OUTDOORS. SO INSTEAD OF TAKING A BREAK AFTER YOUR LAST RELATIONSHIP, YOU JUMPED RIGHT INTO ANOTHER ONE WITH THE GREAT OUTDOORS. BEST RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD. I SOUND LIKE SUCH A SAD SACK. THE MOST FULFILLING RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD IS WITH MY CELL PHONE, SO, RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE AT NIGHT, ISN'T IT? IT REALLY IS. YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED ME THE OTHER NIGHT WHY THIS SPOT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S BECAUSE OF MY DAD. HIS OFFICE WAS RIGHT OVER THERE. WE USED TO HAVE PICNICS RIGHT OVER THERE. SOME OF OUR BEST TALKS. I MISS THAT. HE WAS THE ONE THAT TAUGHT ME TO ALWAYS FIGHT FOR WHAT'S RIGHT, EVEN WHEN IT GETS TOUGH. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO REMEMBER THAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S NOT HERE TO REMIND ME. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. YOU JUST SPENT THREE NIGHTS UP IN THAT TREE. SEEMS PRETTY TOUGH TO ME. "FOOLISH" MIGHT BE A BETTER WORD. THERE'S NOTHING FOOLISH ABOUT STANDING UP FOR WHAT'S IMPORTANT. YOU'RE A WOMAN OF ACTION, REMEMBER? SO HOW DID YOUR DAD PASS? IT WAS A HEART ATTACK. TWO YEARS AGO. I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT. I PREFER TO FOCUS ON MY CAUSES INSTEAD. SEEMS LIKE HE HAD A LOT OF CAUSES, TOO, JUDGING FROM ALL THE PHOTOS I SAW. I GET THAT FROM HIM. LOSING THIS TREE WOULD BE LIKE LOSING HIM ALL OVER AGAIN. SO... I'M NOT GONNA LOSE IT. EVEN IF IT MEANS NEVER LEAVING THIS SPOT. WHAT IF WE COULD MOVE THE TREE FROM THIS SPOT? THE ROOTS ARE DESTROYING THE PLUMBING. IF WE MOVE THE ROOTS, THE PROBLEM'S SOLVED. CAN WE EVEN DO THAT? A BUDDY OF MINE IS A FOREMAN AT CHICAGO WORKS. THEY'VE TRANSPLANTED A BUNCH OF TREES. I COULD CALL HIM AND ASK HOW HE DID IT. CAN YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND RIGHT NOW? IT'S A LITTLE LATE RIGHT NOW. COULDN'T WE WAIT TILL THE MORNING? I'M A WOMAN OF ACTION, REMEMBER? YEAH, YOU ARE. YEAH, I AM. YOU TWO MAKE A HANDSOME COUPLE. OH, HI, MRS. HAVERSACK. WE'RE NOT A COUPLE. WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE ON OPPOSING SIDES OF AN ARGUMENT TRYING TO COME TO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL DECISION. KINDA WORDY, BUT ACCURATE. MRS. HAVERSACK, CAN I CHAIN YOU TO THE TREE FOR A BIT? THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND YOU, THANK YOU. THAT WAS A PERFECT MOMENT FOR A KISS. WHY DID YOU CHICKEN OUT? I DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK IN CHICAGO AGAIN. SO THEN WHAT WILL YOU DO? THEN WE TRANSFER THE TREE TO ITS NEW LOCATION, AWAY FROM THE PIPES. IT'S A WIN-WIN. IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? IT IS. YEAH. I'VE BEEN DOING ALL THIS RESEARCH. SO, THE TOWN OF ORANGE, CALIFORNIA, SUCCESSFULLY MOVED AN 80-YEAR-OLD FICUS, AND IN LEAGUE CITY, TEXAS, THEY TRANSPLANTED A 100-YEAR-OLD OAK. OKAY. OKAY AS IN "YES"? I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU ALMOST SAY "YES" BEFORE. OKAY AS IN "I'LL THINK ABOUT IT." YOU GOT QUESTIONS? LAY 'EM ON ME. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA MOVE IT TO? WE'RE STILL FIGURING THAT OUT. HOW MUCH WILL IT COST? HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? CAN SORENSEN DO IT, OR DO I NEED A NEW CONTRACTOR? THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS. AND AS FAR AS GREAT ANSWERS GO? UM... I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. RIGHT. MORNING. DON'T YOU MEAN "GOOD MORNING"? I MADE HEADWAY WITH THE MAYOR LAST NIGHT. I TALKED TO MY FRIEND WHO DID THE TREE TRANSPLANTS. HE SAID THE BIG OLD TREE'S JUST TOO OLD AND TOO BIG. DON'T TALK ABOUT HER AGE LIKE THAT. THE CHANCE OF SURVIVING A MOVE IS UNLIKELY. BUT THE OTHER TREES I READ ABOUT SURVIVED. THEY WEREN'T 130 YEARS OLD, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEMS. YOU'D BE TAKING A BIG RISK. OKAY. DON'T TELL MAYOR PARKER WE CAN'T MOVE THE TREE. WE HAVE TO TELL HIM SOMETHING. ZEE, I'M READY FOR YOU NOW. I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEAS. WE'RE JUST THINKING TOO HARD. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF OUR HEADS. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, I DON'T FEEL MUCH LIKE AN APICAL MERISTEM RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO BUILD A BENCH. WHY WOULD I WANT A BENCH? TO SIT ON. WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LET OUR UNCONSCIOUS MINDS WORK, SO WHY NOT BE PRODUCTIVE WHILE WE WAIT? OKAY. BUT I DON'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO INVOLVE WOODWORK. HAVE YOU EVER MADE ANYTHING? I USED TO DO NEEDLEPOINT. SO WHY'D YOU QUIT? I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T SEE THE POINT. OF NEEDLEPOINT. THE POINT IS TO CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, EVEN IF THAT SOMETHING IS JUST A BENCH. AIMIE, CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS. IT'S IMPORTANT. I'VE BUILT A LOT OVER THE YEARS. TABLES, CANOES, DESKS. EVEN MY FAIR SHARE OF WALLS. THAT WAS A JOKE. I WAS JUST TRYING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I CAN BE GUARDED. AH, YOU MEANT METAPHORICAL WALLS. I'VE BUILT PLENTY OF ACTUAL, REAL WALLS, BUT, YES, IN THIS CONTEXT, I WAS SPEAKING OF METAPHORICAL ONES. I'VE BUILT A FEW OF THOSE, TOO. YEAH? THEY'RE EASIER TO BUILD THAN TREE HOUSES. LET'S SEE HERE... AH, PERFECT. A BENCH. BEAUTIFUL. HI, MOM. OH, HEY. SO SORRY I DIDN'T CALL YOU BACK LAST NIGHT. MY PHONE DIED. YOUR PHONE NEVER DIES. I KNOW. WHAT'S WEIRDER IS I DIDN'T MISS IT. WELL, THAT'S NICE. WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU? I HEARD IT IN YOUR VOICE WHEN YOU CALLED. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. I'M GONNA BE FINE. I THINK I'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, BUT, UM... CAN WE SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE? OKAY. FIGURE WHAT OUT? THE BANK THREATENED TO FORECLOSE ON THE HOUSE. I GOT BEHIND ON THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. OH, MOM. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? WE TOOK THAT SECOND MORTGAGE RIGHT BEFORE DAD DIED, AND THEN... I JUST GOT BEHIND. I-I COULDN'T OPEN THE MAIL FOR MONTHS, AND... BY THE TIME I WAS READY TO FACE REALITY, I WAS IN WAY OVER MY HEAD. MOM, I WOULD'VE HELPED IF I'D KNOWN. I KNOW, BUT I... I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BURDEN. AND I WAS EMBARRASSED. YOUR FATHER HANDLED ALL THE FINANCES. I KNEW NOTHING OKAY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE THAT HOUSE. I SEE HIM IN EVERYTHING. ESPECIALLY YOU. AND I JUST MISS HIM SO MUCH, ALL THE TIME... AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT... NO, I DO, IT'S JUST HARD. I KNOW. I KNOW. BUT I WISH THAT YOU WOULD OPEN UP. YOU THROW YOURSELF INTO YOUR CAUSES, AND I... IT'S A WAY OF COPING. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT... BUT I JUST WISH... SOMETIMES, IT JUST GETS LONELY NOT BEING ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HIM. I'M SORRY. JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT. I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HURT AGAIN. I KNOW THAT, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET HURT EITHER... YOUR DAD WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. BUT... I THINK I'M READY TO MOVE FORWARD. I WANT TO GO ON A DATE WITH LARRY. I KNOW. I THINK IT'S SWEET. REALLY. YOU KNOW I LIKE HIM? AND YOU'RE NOT UPSET WITH ME? UPSET WITH YOU? MOM, HE'S GREAT. SO DOES THIS MEAN WE CAN TALK ABOUT DAD? I'M GETTING THERE. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT THIS HOUSE THING. WE WILL. OKAY. THANK YOU, BABY. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, MOM. IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN A FRITTER THIS TIME. I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE TO INTERVIEW REPLACEMENTS, BECAUSE I'M TOO BUSY DEALING WITH ALL OF YOUR DRAMA. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. YOU ASKED ME IF I KNEW OF ANYONE WHO COULD REPLACE YOU, AND, OBVIOUSLY, NO ONE EVER CAN, BUT... SKIP THE NICETIES. WHO IS IT? MY MOM. SHE'S SMART, SHE'S TENACIOUS, SHE DOESN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER... ALL GOOD QUALITIES FOR THE MAYOR'S ASSISTANT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? SHE ISN'T A BAD IDEA. WHY ARE YOU HESITATING? BECAUSE I DON'T MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. AND THE PERSON WHO DOES DOESN'T EXACTLY LIKE YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE JOKING. I THOUGHT YOU WERE COMING IN HERE TO TELL ME HOW TO MOVE A TREE. PLEASE DON'T BE MAYOR PARKER RIGHT NOW. PLEASE BE MY OLD FRIEND, TOM, WHOSE OLD FRIEND, AIMIE, NEEDS A FAVOR. YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE YOUR MOM A JOB AFTER THE MESS YOU'VE CREATED? YOU'RE MAD. I GET IT. I'M SORRY. I COULD'VE FIRED YOU... THE SECOND YOU GOT IN THAT TREE... BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORY. IF WE COULD JUST GET BACK TO MY MOM. THE THING IS, I'VE BEEN A FRIEND HERE, BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT, I HAVE TO BE THE MAYOR. MY MOM'S GOING TO LOSE HER HOUSE, TOM. I'M SORRY. TRULY, I AM. BUT THINGS CHANGE, AIMIE. PEOPLE LOSE HOUSES. TREES GET CUT DOWN. YOU CAN'T SAVE EVERYTHING. WHAT IF I COULD ONLY SAVE ONE THING? - HEY, MOM. - HEY. I HAVE GREAT NEWS. WHAT? I GOT YOU A JOB. - WHAT? - YEAH. THE MAYOR NEEDS AN ASSISTANT. THE POSITION'S YOURS IF YOU WANT IT. IF THE BANK KNOWS YOU HAVE A JOB, THEY'LL WORK WITH YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, MY GOSH. ARE YOU EXCITED? AIMIE, THANK YOU. WHAT... WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THEM? I HAVE TO ABANDON THE TREE. NO. NO, I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO THAT. YEAH. MOM. MOM, LISTEN. LISTEN. DAD LOVED THAT TREE, BUT HE LOVED YOU MORE. HE WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED YOU TO BE IN TROUBLE. NEITHER DO I. BABY, I AM SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. - YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME? - YES. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUNG, AND YOU... YOU SHOULD BE DATING, AND INSTEAD, YOUR WHOLE LIFE REVOLVES AROUND HELPING OTHER PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN D.C. WAS HARD. IT'S COMPLICATED. YEAH. LIKE, I THOUGHT I HAD IT ALL, YOU KNOW? AND THEN... MY JOB ENDED, MATT ENDED... AND THEN DAD JUST DIED. HE WAS THE ONE THAT ME FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY. YOU KNOW? HE MADE ME FEEL GROUNDED. SO NOW IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE DATING, BECAUSE IF I DATE, I MIGHT FALL IN LOVE, AND IF I FALL IN LOVE, I MIGHT WANT TO GET MARRIED, AND IF I GET MARRIED, THEN WHO'S GOING TO WALK ME DOWN THE AISLE? OH! I'M GOING TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE. OH! IS THAT WEIRD? NO. NO. MOMS DO IT ALL THE TIME. OH, BABY, DON'T BE AFRAID TO FALL IN LOVE, BECAUSE... BECAUSE IT'S A BIG "WHAT IF?" AND SOMETIMES, THOSE "WHAT IF'S"... THEY'RE MAGICAL. THANK YOU, MOM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GIVING UP. AND I KNOW I SAID I'M NOT A GIVER-UPPER, BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I GUESS. ANYWAY, YOU WON. CONGRATS. AIMIE. WHAT HAPPENED? MY MOM'S GONNA LOSE HER HOUSE, AND... WHATEVER. IT'S COMPLICATED. BUT LISTEN, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN... FRIENDLY... AND I JUST... I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU... HAVE A JOB TO DO. I GET THAT. SO... ANYWAY... THAT'S IT. AIMIE... WELL... I'M READY FOR MY TRAINING. SUPER. GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD, ZEE. WELCOME TO THE TEAM. AND THE TREE'S EMPTY, SO... DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU SOME MORE SLOGANS LATER TODAY. GREAT. THANKS, AIMIE. TEAL, CAN YOU SHOW ZEE HOW TO WORK THE PHONES? AND CAN YOU GET ME KYLE SORENSEN? I ALREADY HAVE HIM ON LINE ONE. KYLE? YEAH. WE'RE ALL CLEAR. CUT IT DOWN. I JUST HEARD THE NEWS. I KNOW IT'S STILL DAYLIGHT, BUT SHOULD I GET THE EMERGENCY WINE? NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE OKAY. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SLOGANS? OKAY, WELL, HERE'S ONE I'VE BEEN NOODLING WITH. OKAY? "AMPLE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH." IT ISN'T THAT GREAT, RIGHT? WE CAN DO BETTER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING HERE? YOU NEED TO SEE THE TREE. I DON'T WANT TO... JUST... HOW BAD IS IT? TELL ME. SEE FOR YOURSELF. TRUST ME. IT'S STILL HERE. WHY IS IT STILL HERE? WHY DO YOU THINK? I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU LOSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAVED THE TREE. WELL... I DIDN'T. I'M STILL DOING MY JOB. I JUST BOUGHT YOU SOME TIME. AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH, I'M A BELIEVER IN SECOND CHANCES. YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD, YOU DESERVE SOME TIME TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. A SECOND CHANCE. I CAN FIGURE THIS OUT, RIGHT? YEAH. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY FOR ME TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY. JUST TRY TO MAKE IT QUICK. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN HOLD OFF THE MAYOR. I'M ON IT. KYLE... THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME KYLE BOUGHT US, BUT WE NEED TO THINK FAST. WAIT, DIDN'T YOU JUST MAKE A DEAL WITH MAYOR PARKER THAT INVOLVED YOU GIVING UP? YEAH, I DID, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M NOT HONORING THAT DEAL, BUT IF KYLE'S TEMPORARILY THE VILLAIN IN THE MAYOR'S EYES, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT, TOO. I WISH WE HAD CAKE RIGHT NOW. RIGHT? SO WHERE SHOULD WE START? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP ME. YOU CAN TOTALLY DO YOUR OWN WORK. I WANT TO HELP. WHERE SHOULD WE START? WAIT, YOU'RE ASKING ME? WOW. THIS IS COOL. OKAY, LET'S GO BACK TO BASICS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? OKAY, THE PROBLEM IS THE PIPES. MORE SPECIFICALLY? THE ROOTS INTERFERING WITH THE PIPES. SO IT'S A SPATIAL THING. LIKE WHEN CLOTHES OVERFLOW IN YOUR CLOSET. COULD YOU MOVE THE TREE? NOT POSSIBLE. I ALREADY LOOKED INTO IT. WHAT IF YOU MOVE THE PIPES? WHAT IF WE MOVE THE PIPES? I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO BE A LOT EASIER TO MOVE THAN A WHOLE TREE, ASSUMING THERE'S NO MAJOR PIPELINES. WE JUST NEED A BLUEPRINT. I TOLD YOU TO CUT. I'M CUTTING. I DON'T SEE ANY CUTTING. I SEE MY CONTRACTOR NOT DOING HIS JOB. COME ON. JUST GIVE HER A LITTLE MORE TIME. SHE'S HAD TIME. AND SHE AND I HAD A DEAL. AFTER EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE FOR THIS TOWN. YOU'RE NOT EVEN FROM HERE. SHE LEAVES A PRETTY BIG IMPRESSION. I'LL GET GORDON'S GREENERY TO CUT IT DOWN. THIS IS WAY TOO BIG OF A JOB FOR GORDON'S GREENERY. THEN I'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE... SINCE YOU'RE LEAVING ME NO CHOICE. HEY. HEY. I BROUGHT YOU SOME DONUTS. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, ZEE. I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MAYOR PARKER LEFT, BUT I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. OH, IT'S NOTHING. NO, IT REALLY MEANS... IT MEANS A LOT TO AIMIE. YEAH, I KNOW. ANYWAY, ENJOY. ZEE, I WAS WONDERING... WOULD IT BE OKAY WITH YOU IF I ASKED YOUR DAUGHTER OUT? ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HAND IN DATING? YES. MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. WELL, I'M NOT MOST PEOPLE. I CAN SEE THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE? UH... YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL HAVE OUR FAIR SHARE, BUT I'M WORKING THROUGH MINE. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING NICER TO WEAR? I THINK I'VE GOT A SHIRT WITH BUTTONS, YEAH. WILL YOU GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN? LET'S NOT JUMP THE GUN, ZEE. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I WOULD, ONE DAY, DEFINITELY LIKE TO HAVE KIDS. MAYBE WE SHOULD GET A RESCUE DOG FIRST. ALL RIGHT. YOU... YOU HAVE MY BLESSING. THANK YOU, ZEE. I'M SORRY I CALLED YOU "TREE KILLER." WE CAN TOTALLY FIGURE THIS OUT. I THINK IT'S UPSIDE-DOWN. YOU SEE THAT? WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ALREADY. BUT I NEED TO VISUALIZE IT BETTER. HERE... IF THIS IS THE TREE... AND THIS IS THE LIEUTENANT'S STATUE... SO IF THESE ARE THE PIPES... WAIT, WAIT... LEONA, YOU'RE BRILLIANT. I AM? YEAH. THE ROOTS DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE COFFEE STIRRERS. BECAUSE THEY'RE COFFEE STIRRERS. NO, BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOVE GROUND. WHAT IF WE MOVE THE PIPES ABOVE GROUND? THIS COULD ACTUALLY WORK. WE JUST NEED APPROVAL FROM THE MAYOR. SO, SINCE YOU'RE MY MOM, DO I HAVE TO BRING YOU FRITTERS EVERY TIME I WANT TO TALK TO HIM? ACTUALLY, I'D PREFER BEAR CLAWS. NO GOOD. BUT FOR NOW, YOU CAN GO IN. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO LOOK FOR YOU. DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE ON THE SAME WAVE LENGTH? I DOUBT IT'S THE SAME WAVE LENGTH. OKAY. I'LL GO FIRST. I HAVE A SOLUTION. DEFINITELY DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, SEEING AS OUR FRIEND, KYLE, IS NOW PLAYING FOR YOUR TEAM, I'M FIRING HIM. AND AS SOON AS I CAN GET SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THE JOB, THE TREE IS COMING DOWN. OKAY, OKAY... JUST LISTEN TO MY PLAN. WE HAD A DEAL, AIMIE. NO, WE COULD STILL HAVE A DEAL, BUT I THINK I FIGURED OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH WIN. NO. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. GET KYLE TO GET OUT OF THE TREE SO SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO HIS JOB. WAIT. YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO MY PLAN B? I DON'T SEE THE POINT. BUT, HEY, SILVER LINING... I DID GO OVER SOME OF THOSE SLOGANS YOUR OFFICE SENT OVER AND I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME REAL WINNERS IN THERE. I'LL BE SURE TO TELL MY TEAM. OKAY. KYLE, I NEED ONE MORE FAVOR. CALL THE MAYOR, TELL HIM YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND, YOU'RE CUTTING DOWN THE BIG OLD TREE DOWN TOMORROW. I'LL EXPLAIN MORE WHEN I TALK TO YOU. ARE YOU READY TO CUT? JUST DOING THE FINAL SAFETY CHECK. I WASN'T EXPECTING A CROWD. I THINK THEY'RE EXPECTING ANOTHER SHOW FROM AIMIE. IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE? I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO THE JOB I'M PAYING YOU FOR. HI THERE. HOW ARE YOU? SHEILA! LOVE YOUR HAIR! YES, SIR. OH, THIS IS A BIG STORY FOR ME FOR THE NEWSPAPER. I COULD GET PROMOTED, AND AIMIE SAID TO BE READY FOR A SHOW. WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'M CAPTURING IT FOR AMPLE HILLS ONLINE. THAT'S STREAMING TO THE WEBSITE? WE HAVE 30 VIEWERS ALREADY. HI, EVERYONE. GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. THIS IS SHAZ. I'M REPORTING TO YOU LIVE FROM AMPLE HILLS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT AIMIE'S UP TO? I'M IN THE DARK. SHE SAID TO BRING EVERY CLIPBOARD WE HAD. GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT TOGETHER. IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT WE HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE BIG OLD TREE, BUT I THINK THE COMMUNITY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE... WE'RE READY. GREAT. OKAY, THEN LET'S GET ON WITH IT BEFORE WE HAVE ANY MORE... NOT SO FAST. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I HAVE A SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA WORK FOR BOTH OF US. YOU'RE INCORRIGIBLE, AIMIE ROARKE. I THINK THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS "INSPIRATIONAL." CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, PLEASE? IN ONE WEEK, THE ANNUAL FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL'S GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE RIGHT HERE, AND IT WOULD BE A GROSS INJUSTICE TO CUT DOWN THE BIG OLD TREE BEFORE THEN. BUT I HAVE A PLAN. MAYOR PARKER, I KNOW MY JOB IS ON THE LINE, BUT MY FATHER TAUGHT ME THAT ONE PERSON CAN CHANGE THE WORLD, ONE GOOD DEED AT A TIME. I'M DETERMINED TO HONOR HIS LEGACY, AND TONIGHT, BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP, I'M GOING TO ASK MYSELF, "WHAT WAS YOUR GOOD DEED?" AND I'LL SAY, "I SAVED THE BIG OLD TREE." BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WITH THE TREE ISN'T THE TREE, IT'S THE PIPES UNDERNEATH THAT ARE THE PROBLEM. BUT PIPES CAN MOVE, AND WE CAN TURN THEM INTO A GORGEOUS PIECE OF ART. IT'S A WAY THAT WE CAN TRANSFORM THIS PARK INTO AN INCREDIBLE ARTISTIC HUB AT THE CENTER OF OUR TOWN... A TOURIST DESTINATION, EVEN. IS IT FOOLISH TO ASK HOW MUCH THIS IDEA WOULD COST? I MEAN, DO YOU EVEN KNOW? YEAH. I DO. I STAYED UP LATE LAST NIGHT AND I CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS. HERE THEY ARE. THIS IS EXPENSIVE. BUT IT'S JUST A ONE-TIME EXPENSE, INSTEAD OF THE CONSTANT YEARLY REPAIR OF THE PIPES. IT'S A WAY TO SAVE THE TREE WHILE PREVENTING IT FROM CAUSING FUTURE PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THIS. I'D LOVE TO BE THE GOOD GUY HERE, I REALLY WOULD, BUT THIS IS LITERALLY A PIPE DREAM. I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT. I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF YOU ABOUT HOW SPECIAL THIS SPOT IS. YOU'VE SHARED WITH ME THAT YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THE MEMORIES THAT YOU'VE BUILT HERE. SO, I'M ASKING YOU FOR HELP, ONE LAST TIME. WILL YOU CHIP IN AND HELP ME SAVE THE BIG OLD TREE? I'LL START. I PLEDGE $100. I'LL CHIP IN. HEY. I'LL CHIP IN, TOO. OKAY. - ME TOO. - I'LL CHIP IN. - ME TOO. - COUNT ME IN. ANYONE ELSE? RAISE YOUR HAND, PLEASE, IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP ME SAVE THE TREE. YES! YES, YES, YES! YES! THANK YOU. OKAY, LOOK, I'VE GOT A LATE MORNING MEETING. SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT WHEN I'M DONE. I MEAN ACTUAL DONATIONS... NOT PLEDGED PROMISES. THIS IS SO EXCITING, KYLE. I'VE GOT TO GO HURRY UP AND GET MORE DONATIONS, BUT THIS IS SO AMAZING, ISN'T IT? AIMIE, IT IS, IT IS, BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING FIRST. CAN IT WAIT? NO. I LIKE YOU, AIMIE ROARKE. YOU MAKE ME WANT TO STAY HERE IN AMPLE HILLS INSTEAD OF "JUST PASSING THROUGH." I WANT YOU TO BE MY APICAL MERISTEM. WHAT I'M SAYING IS... WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME? YES. BUT I'VE GOT TO GO RAISE SOME MONEY FIRST. OKAY. - OKAY. - YEAH. PUT ME DOWN FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS. YOU GOT IT. ANOTHER $100 DONATION. IT'S ONLY BEEN AN HOUR. WE'RE ALMOST TO OUR GOAL. THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN. HOLD ON. I JUST GOT A DONATION FROM MAYOR PARKER! YOU DID IT, AIMIE. NO, THE WHOLE TOWN DID IT. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA RUN A QUICK ERRAND. YOU TAKE OVER? SURE. HI THERE. EXCELLENT... BEAR CLAWS, AS YOU REQUESTED. OOH! I LOVE THE PERKS OF THIS JOB. GO ON IN. HE'S EXPECTING YOU. THANKS. OH, AND AIMIE? DAD WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU BACK SO SOON. YOU MADE A DONATION. FROM MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT. I WANTED TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. THANK YOU. I'M JUST GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION WE COULD ALL LIVE WITH... ESPECIALLY THE TREE. AND I DON'T LACK RHYTHM. "TURN OVER A NEW LEAF IN AMPLE HILLS." NOW, THAT IS A GOOD TOWN SLOGAN. YOU LIKE IT? YEAH. I LIKE IT A LOT. YOU NAILED IT! I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. YEAH? OH, WOW. AIMIE... ISN'T IT AMAZING? YEAH. I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. COME HERE. THAT'S THE BENCH WE MADE. LOOK CLOSER. OH, MOM. IT WAS KYLE'S IDEA. OKAY! TIME FOR THE ANNUAL FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL PHOTO, EVERYONE. COME ON IN! COME ON IN! I WANT YOU TO GET ALL THESE PEOPLE, OKAY? BUT MAKE SURE I'M IN FOCUS. ZEE, ABOUT THAT DATE... YOU ARE CERTAINLY TENACIOUS. I LEARNED FROM YOUR DAUGHTER. PICK ME UP TOMORROW AT 7:00. WE SHOULD CARVE OUR INITIALS IN THE TREE TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT. IT'S ALREADY A MOMENT I'LL NEVER FORGET. OKAY, EVERYONE SAY "TREE." ONE, TWO, THREE... TREE!
