(â™ª "Oceania, 'T is for Thee") (commentator) This is our land. A land of peace and of plenty. A land of harmony and hope. This is our land. Oceania. These are our people. The workers. The strivers. The builders. These are our people. The builders of our world, struggling, fighting, bleeding, dying. (screaming) On the streets of our cities and on the far-flung battlefields, fighting against the mutilation of our hopes and dreams. Who are they? (crowd chant) Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! They are the dark armies. The dark, murdering armies of Eurasia. In the barren deserts of Africa and India. On the oceans of Australasia, courage, strength and youth are sacrificed, sacrificed to barbarians whose only honour is atrocity. But even as we grasp at victory, there is a cancer, an evil tumour, growing, spreading in our midst. Shout! Shout! Shout out his name. (crowd) Goldstein! Goldstein! (Goldstein's voice drowned out by crowd) (crowd screams abuse) Death! Death! Traitor! Traitor! Death! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! No! No! ("Oceania, 'T is for Thee") (crowd chant "BB.") (announcer) "Innuendo" deleted. "Intransigence" rendered as "Crimethink". "Inversion"... (dials telephone) Ref Times, 14/2/84, page three. Byline two should read " Miniprod forecast increase choco ration, April 1984, from 20g to 25g per week." (man) I confess to spreading the rumour on orders from Goldstein that the war is not really with Eurasia, but with Eastasia. And that for years, in fact since the days of our glorious revolution, - I had no faith in our future. - (coughs) I forged government announcements and falsified figures quoted for agricultural and industrial production. As a result of mental disturbance dating from my experiences in the atomic wars, I was a willing subject of Goldstein's influence. I was stubborn and egocentric. When ownlife thoughts occurred to me, I revelled in them. I went into the proletarian zones. I had sex with prostitutes. I deliberately contracted syphilis. It was at this time that I made contact with the Resistance. I was personally contacted by the arch-traitor Goldstein and ordered to assassinate Inner Party officials. - Bugger! - This I did. My agents forged documents and gained entry to the Ministry of Truth... (Winston) Thoughtcrime is death. Thoughtcrime does not entail death. Thoughtcrime is death. I have committed, even before setting pen to paper, the essential crime that contains all others in itself. (man)... encouraging my agents to deface party posters and announcements. I read and memorised Goldstein's book. For 30 years, I have plotted to bring down the Party. I was sick in mind and body. Together with my colleagues, Aaronson and Rutherford, I did counterfeit important Party documents, including ex-London permits and travel passes. And that by use of these documents my agents travelled freely throughout Airstrip One, encouraging insurrection and organising a huge counterplot to destroy the innermost faction of the Oceanian leadership. Furthermore, I used my position of privilege within the Inner Party to pervert and betray the truth at all times and to suggest, wherever possible, that our traditional allies in Eastasia were, in fact, our deadly enemies... (Winston) April 4th 1984. I think. To the past, or to the future, to an age when thought is free. From the age of Big Brother, from the age of the Thought Police... from a dead man, greetings. (high-pitched whine) (whine becomes siren) (coughs and splutters) 30-40 group, take your places, please. Right, let's see which one of us can touch his toes. Right over from the hips, brothers and sisters, please. One, two. One, two. One, two. - One, two. - (coughs and splutters) Smith. 6079 Smith W. Yes, you. Bend lower. You're not trying. Watch me. There, brother, that's what I want. Anyone under 45 is perfectly capable of touching his toes. I'm 39 and I've had four children. We don't all have the privilege of fighting. Remember our boys on the Malabar front. Just think what they have to put up with. (coughing) - Morning, Smith. - Parsons. - Heard the rumour? - No. Good news, is it? I should say so, yes. Choco rations going up. - Really? - 25g next week. Doubleplus good, eh? By the way, Smith, I seem to have run out of razor blades for some reason. You wouldn't happen to have any spare? I'm sorry, brother, I'm on the last one. (announcer) In 1983, Oceania's coal output reached 630 million tonnes. In 1976, coal output was 605 million tonnes, an increase of 4. 1 per cent. 5.3 million tractors were produced, an increase of 17.6 per cent. I wanted to ask you if you've got any razor blades. I've tried all over the place. I've been using the same one for six weeks. Did you see the prisoners hanged yesterday? No, I was working. But I shall see it on the screens. We'll pick up a gin on the way. I'll have two. Give me a gin. (announcer) 2.2 million 0.5 Victory recoil-operated heavy machine guns, 6 million rifle grenades, 9 million Perry pineapple pin grenades and 1.4 million lightweight spigot-launching antitank rocket projectors. Food production is also up... - How's the Newspeak Committee? - Working overtime. The plusbig wastage is in adjectives. Plusbig problem is timing the language to scientific advance. Yes. It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. You won't have seen the dictionary tenth edition yet, Smith. It's that thick. The 11th edition will be that thick. So the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect? The secret is to move from translation to direct thought to automatic response. - Language coming from here not here. - Excuse me for intruding. We shall be rid of Goldsteinism when the language has been cleaned. I couldn't be more in agreement with you, brother. Absolutely. (applause) Praise be to our leader and the Party workers. Other munitions production figures are as follows. 70,000 M-20 tank destroyers with 76 mm cannon... Smith. Syme. (Syme) It's encouraging that by 2050 not a single person could have a conversation like this. - Except the proles. - Proletariat don't count. They're animals. Did you see the hanging? Missed it myself. Bloody committees! (announcer)... heavy Victory rocket bombs. 35,000 Black Eagle 500cc motorbicycles. 300,000... Doubleplus good, this. Do you know, I don't think there is a single piece of meat in this stew. Looks like meat, tastes like meat. It isn't meat at all. Doubleplus good. - Not like it, Smith? - Yes. It's too rich for me. D'you mind if I? Brothers and sisters, the battle for production has been won. Completed returns show that the standard of living has risen by 20 per cent over the last year. All over Oceania, spontaneous demonstrations of Party workers have been voicing their gratitude and joy. In honour of this massive overfulfilment of the ninth Three-Year Plan, it has been announced that the chocolate ration is to be increased to 25g per week. (Winston) If there is hope, it lies in the proles. If they were conscious of their strength, they would have no need to conspire. History does not matter to them. (cheering) It was three years ago, on a dark evening, easy to slip the patrols, and I'd gone into the proletarian areas. There was no one else in the street and no telescreens. Two dollars. She said "Two dollars." So I went with her. She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me - the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Come on. Come on. Come on. There were no preliminaries. Standing there with the scent of dead insects and cheap perfume, I went ahead and did it just the same. Rutherford Unperson, substitute Ogilvy. Ogilvy biog, details as follows. War hero, recently killed Malabar front. Today awarded posthumous Order of Conspicuous Merit 2nd class. (man) I accuse myself of sabotage, embezzlement of Party funds, sale of military secrets, of being in the pay of the government of Eurasia, of being a sexual pervert and a thought criminal. I exploited my position at the Ministry of Peace to mislead our allies in Eastasia, and also to corrupt youth by means of seditious literature and drugs. I am guilty on all counts. I stand here, a victim of the influence of Emmanuel... (Winston) Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, you sold me. And I ask only for you to accept my love of our leader. (distant explosions) (chatter) (distant explosions) Can I help you? Anything special? - I was here before. - Ah. - Razor blades. - Ah-hah. - You sold me the notebook. - Yes. Yes. Please, look round. Hm? Ah. What's this? It's a beautiful thing. It's over a hundred years old. Cost you four dollars. There's another room upstairs that you might like to see. Yes. There's not much in it, just a few things. My woman's dead. I'm just trying to sell the furniture. It's a beautiful bed, if you can get the bugs out of it. (bomb dropping) Interested in old prints at all? The frame's fixed to the wall but I could unscrew it. How did this escape? I know what it is. It's the museum in the street outside the Palace of Justice. Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clement's. What was that? Something old. (announcer) War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. A triumph of willpower over the orgasm. At a rally of the Anti-Sex League in Victory Square held to celebrate a 50 per cent decrease in civil marriages, over 10,000 Party women took a vow of celibacy and pledged themselves as vessels... I hate her. I should kill her before she denounces me. I have disliked her from the first moment of seeing her. (announcer) Sector 43: 929 male, 753 female. Sector 44: 437 male, 609 female. (cries out) - Are you hurt? - Oh, it's nothing. It's my arm. I'll be all right in a second. Brother, could you? - Are you all right? - It's nothing. I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. Thank you, brother. Who is she? All I know is that she works in the Porno Section, probably on the proletarian novel-writing machines. (cheering) - Mrs Parsons, a spanner? - Under the sink, beside you. (coughs) Thank you, brother. I wouldn't have had to bother you, but my husband's out late - committees. You know what us Parsons are like. You're a thought criminal. They haven't been out much. Thank you, brother. - (fanfare) - Attention. Your attention, please. A newsflash has arrived from the Malabar front. The forces of Oceania in south India have won a glorious victory. I am authorised to say that the war against Eurasia is within measurable distance of its end. 40,000 Eurasian soldiers have been killed or captured. Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! (cheering) (gunfire/cheering) Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! - Can you hear me? - Yes. - Do you have an ex-London permit? - Yes. Can you get Sunday afternoon off? - Yes. - Take this. It's quite precise. I rely on you to destroy it. Are you sure you can come? Yes. On your own, brother? No, I'm joining the Vicmans Community Hiking Group. I was held up on urgent Minrec business. (children) â™ª Sing to the sailors on the floating fortress â™ª Sing to the soldiers on the battlefield â™ª Sing to the airmen in the burning azure â™ª Sing to the farmers' rising yields â™ª We are the children Builders of the future â™ª And we the children swear to thee â™ª Loyal emotion, fearless devotion â™ª And to die with dignity (announcer) A daring and resourceful manoeuvre under the direction of BB ensuring the total annihilation of the Eurasian heavy-armoured division... (twig snaps) Look. It's a dream. I want you. Not here. Come back to the woods. It's safer. - Have you done this before? - Of course. Hundreds of times. - With Party members? - Yes. - Inner Party members? - Not with those bastards. Though there's plenty who would. I hate purity. I hate goodness. I don't want virtue to exist anywhere. - I want everyone corrupt. - I ought to suit you, then. - I'm corrupt to the core. - Do you like doing this? I don't mean just me. I adore it. (man) Winston, we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness. (announcer) Adult literacy amongst the proletariat has risen by 56 per cent. The proletarian infant mortality rate has dropped by 12 per cent. Incidences of leukaemia, tuberculosis and meningitis have dropped considerably. Improved diet has been responsible for a dramatic decrease in rickets. Eye diseases show a steep drop. So too do deaths from pneumonia and smallpox. The improvement in sewerage and drainage has resulted in better health. State rodent operatives report a 50 per cent reduction in the number of vermin in the central proletarian zones. I just want to finish by saying a few words about the impact of this imminent neurological breakthrough. When the orgasm has been finally eradicated, the last remaining obstacle to the psychological acceptance of the principles of Ingsoc as applied to Artsem will be overcome. In other words, the unorthodox tendencies towards ownlife, which threaten the natural erosion of the family unit, will no longer have the biological support of the organism. As we all know, the stimulation of the family leads to private reflection outside Party needs and to the establishment of unorthodox loyalties which only lead to thoughtcrime. But the introduction of Artsem, combined with the neutralisation of the orgasm, will effectively render obsolete the family until it is impossible to conceptualise. Thank you. Excuse me, brother. You dropped your ink pencil. Thank you, sister. (announcer) A pincer movement has developed involving the floating fortresses of the Eurasian 17 th fleet... Hmm! - Not much. - No. Not much left at all these days. The wars. Police don't like us much. That room. How much? Four dollars a week. (uproar) Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Criminal! No! Criminal! No! No! (fanfare) (â™ª "Oceania, 'T is for Thee") (crowd chant "BB.") (announcer) A vast military build-up of armoured divisions and missiles accompanied by a fourfold increase in the number of rocket bombs, directed at the most densely populated areas of Airstrip One... (Winston) It's folly, as though deliberately we move one step nearer the grave. I can't understand why she accepted the idea, she who is so careful. (footsteps) Hello. Hello. Let me show you what I've brought. Look. What is it? Real sugar. Not saccharine. And I've got a loaf of bread, proper white bread. And jam. A real tin of milk. Look. Coffee. Real coffee. Inner Party. Half a kilo. How did you manage to get hold of all this? There's nothing those bastards don't have. - Aren't you pleased? - Yes. Yes, of course. Real tea. There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or something. - I want you. - I want you, too. Wait. Turn around and don't look until I tell you. (woman sings) Listen to that. How can she make a song written by machines sound so beautiful? You can turn round now. - I... - Winston... Do you like me? More than ever. (distant explosion) Was there ever a time when this seemed ordinary? (announcer) Attention! Your attention, please. A vast military build-up has been reported in the Sahara desert, sectors 17 and 18 of the war zone. 14 heavy tank divisions... (Winston) There's truth and there is untruth. Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four. If that is granted, all else follows. (unintelligible Newspeak) Re Times 31/10/81... Brother Tillotson wins mini chess. Request photo. Biog follows. (announcer) Attention! Your attention, please. Will all Outer Party members of Ways And Means committees please attend their local community centres for discussions... (Winston) Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, you sold me. Smith. I have been reading your Newspeak articles in The Times. - Yes. - You write very elegantly. That is not my own opinion. I was talking to a friend of yours who is an expert. His name has slipped my memory for a moment. What I wanted to say was that there were one or two unwords. Only very recent. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak dictionary? No, we are still using the ninth edition at Minrec. A few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. - You might be interested. - Yes. There are plus-skilful new developments. Let me give you my address. I'm usually at home in the evenings. If not, my servant will give you the dictionary. 14,000 Victory Vampires, 6, 700 Ingsoc cadets, 4,600 Ingsoc sea cadets, 12,300 Porteous piloted missiles, 31,000 Victory fighter bombers, 23,000 Big Brother heavy bombers. (Winston) It has happened at last. The call has come. It seems that all my life I have been waiting for it. (announcer)... named after Sublieutenant Ogilvy, hero of the state of Oceania, recently awarded posthumously the Order of Conspicuous Gallantry for his actions in the recent glorious victory over the forces of Eastasia on the Malabar front in south India. Half the water's boiled away. What does the clock say? It says 21.00 hours. What time do they cut the light in your flats? - 23.30. - At the hostel it's 23.00. - What is it? - I don't know. A little chunk of history that they've forgotten to alter. A message from a hundred years ago. Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clement's. You owe me three farthings say the bells of St Martin's. Who taught you that? What is it? I don't know. I just know it. You know, the only thing to do is to walk out of here before it's too late. Never see one another again. Yes. Our luck can't last. You're young, look normal. You're innocent. If you keep clear of people like me then you might stay alive. What you do, I do. I've thought it out. I'm good at staying alive. - When shall we meet again? - Not for several weeks, it's not safe. Give me half an hour. I love you. Julia. Do you think the Resistance is real? No, none of it's real. Steamer! Dead overhead! Get down! Get down! (screaming) Round the clock plus a 153 set in eyes top a PMA Willmer... Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Eurasia is our ally. Eurasia has always been our ally. Everything fades into mist. The past is erased, the erasure forgotten. The lie becomes truth and then becomes a lie again. What is it? I dreamt... about my mother. What, darling? It was during the wars. Before the Party. (mother) Winston! Winston! I couldn't help myself. I knew what I had done, and I couldn't help myself. When I went back, hours later, my mother and sister were gone. I never saw them again. It's not so much staying alive as staying human that's important. What counts is that we don't betray each other. If you mean confessing, we're bound to do that. Everybody does. You can't help it. I don't mean confessing. Confessing isn't betrayal. I mean feelings. If they can make me change my feelings, they can stop me from loving you. That would be real betrayal. They can't do that. It's the one thing they can't do. They can torture you and make you say anything. But they can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you. They can't get to your heart. I'm going to see O'Brien. I know. Outer Party member 53922 Hicks, Minirec, Proletarian Affairs Section. Outer Party member 22315 Howard, Miniprod, Hospital Section.

That concludes the list of known agents of Goldstein actively engaged in the latest conspiracy... Not much of this gets to the Outer Party, I'm afraid. To our leader. Our eternal allies in Eurasia are turning against us. More nests of conspirators and saboteurs have been uncovered. Further arrests are expected shortly. - You can? - Yes. We're allowed that privilege. Some more of this? It is called wine. There are thought criminals who maintain that the Resistance is not real. Believe me, Winston, it is very real. Perhaps you are not familiar with how it operates.
