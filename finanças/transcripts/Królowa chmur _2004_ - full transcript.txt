I've made some corrections. That's rig ht. There's one cloud more. You scared me, Jacek. Please don't call me Jacek. - I'm not Jacek. - And who's this? Me. Exactly. I may be senile, but I don't have Alzheimer's. Some coffee? No, thanks. I'll fix you a cup! Mimi! - There's no time. - Mimi? OK, whatever... You know what nickname I had at the Academy? Queen of Clouds! It was your father's idea. Nice, isn't it? Look, you were supposed to pack your stuff for today. Why? We're going away, remember? You got the tickets? See that? Yeah. Can be ours. We're not flying. Why not? I gave you the money. With your pacemaker flying is out. It's a good one. From East Germany. There's no East Germany. Funny. I forgot to laugh! You have any points? No, I'm clean. I obey the law. - See this? It's your speed. - Impossible. Twice the speed limit. That's 'IO points and 500 zloty fine. It's my fault, officer! I told my son to step on it. We're headed for Rio and want to be on time. Rio de Janeiro, you know. Please don't interrupt. Introduce me. Mrs. Wanda Przybylovvicz, - ...a painter. - Renowned for psychological portraits. Sgt. Droga. Go back to the car. Stand still. What a head! Look up. Chin up. To the left. Greek profile! Did you know? Your head's just perfect! I'll paint you on our way back. I hope you'll be here. Is she your mother? Let's make it. Here's my catalog. Keep it. So it's a deal: A portrait on our way back. Hurry up, or we'll miss our ship. Your old mother can still be useful. To see my darling sister Barbara! She's a beauty, you'll see. They call her Samba Queen. Nice, isn't it? Answer for me. I'm not here. Hello? She didn't say anything. Who? Your wife. How do you know it was her? I could smell - ...her perfume. - Over the phone? I've a good sense of smell. Oh yeah? I have poor eyes, but my nose is like... like... Oh my God... I have it on the tip of my tongue... What's the word? Alzheimer's. Can I get you something? Is our plan working out? Great. Sad voice? No. Just a stomach upset. Nerves, you know. You forgot what? A candle? Could you help me, please? I've got no change. You need some? No. What is it then? Who ate Little Red Riding Hood? A wolf? Rig ht! A wolf, who else? Thanks. Nice to meet a well-read person. Good day. A wolf! Where? Rig ht here. - My smell is like a wolf's. - What? I don't have Alzheimer's. Don't worry. I remember all scout songs. Want me to sing one? Go ahead. You're too exposed. Take my hat. - No, thanks. - Journey by sea... has its advantages. You can feed seagulls and exercise on board. Plus fresh air... You should have a hat. I hate hats. If I'd known your car had no roof I'd have taken Dad's flying cap. You should protect your head, Jacek. Open your mouth. I'll be right back. Do you need any help? I want a candle. How about a scented one? Forest fruits? All right. Security! Please come to Checkout 7! A cup of coffee for you! - When did you last see her? - 2 hours ago. I've looked everywhere. We'll file her as missing 48 hours from now. - What is it? - The supermarket. Thank God! It's her. You guys are just great. - Mimi! - Step back! - She's a shoplifter. - Nonsense! She hid the stuff and won't give it back. Come on, granny! We'll hold her for a strip search. Wait a minute! It's a mistake! Let her go. She's a sick person. - What's wrong with her? - The heart. She has a pacemaker - old, made in East Germany. - She may kick off anytime. - How do you know? I do. Are you related? Yes. No. I mean I'm taking care of her. She likes to be called Mimi. I also prefer Mimi to Mom. Who is she for you then? My... mother. Madam! Go ahead. Mother, you say... Is he your son? I can't see. He's too far. Come up to the cabinet. Come up to the cabinet. Turn to the light. Chin up. Mimi! It's not your studio, but a police station. - Stay put! - It's ridiculous! Is he your son? Mom, don't be silly! - Are you sure? - He's not my son. Look, it's me, Piotr. Jacek, I mean. We're going to Brazil. - All your stuff is in my car. - I don't know him. And you claim you have no Alzheimer's! You're going to Brazil! Remember your sister's name? What's seven times eight? - Seventy-eight. - Shut up. Fifty-six. Good! Then you know what you're doing. You're just showing off to test my patience! Fine. You asked for it. You're not my mother, but an old, sly, mean hag! Get lost! That's it! Finished! A hat? Just this? Why would you want a children's hat, granny? Polish. Barbara will love it. - None like this in Brazil. - I've a confession to make. But there are giant butterflies there. We'll catch some! Mimi, - ...we're not going to Brazil. - Take it off. There's no wind. I wanted to tell you early on, but... I see. You lost the money Barbara had sent for the tickets. Was that so? Yes. My little boy... Will you ever grow up? Excuse me. French fries! - Here you go. - Where are we going then? To a workshop. What for? Gee... You're a painter! You said you just loved to paint. That there was nothing like French fries in the open air. I'd rather paint butterflies in Brazil. Eat. You need energy to paint. Where's mayo? What for? My fries. He has just ketchup. My sister has her French fries only with mayo. The Samba Queen certainly knows best. In Brazil... - Any mayo here? - Sure. In town. - Have them without. - I can't. There's better light in Brazil. Shit! What else can I get you, Mom? I'm fine. Lost your way? I always tell my subordinates: Be 5 minutes ahead of time. And this is the five minutes. Reminds me of Prince Sanguszko's workshops back in the 30s. He'd invite fine arts students. Girls slept in the palace, boys in the barn. Your father was very shy then. But he mustered up his courage to ask my permission to carry my easels around for me. 'If you're kind enough', I said. He'd pick up our stuff and we'd walk across the fields to paint the Lenin Steelworks... What? You've got it all wrong. Nice smile. Just like your Dad's. You have his legs, too. The rest you take after me. - Like what? - Everything. No, Mimi. I don't take after you because I can't. You have my eyes, my nose, my habits. We even exercise alike. Not convinced? Ask anyone. - That railroader. Come on! - Miss! - Tickets are sold on the train! - Just a second! Take a look, please. You see any likeness? Where? Between us. Be honest. Well, actually... - Yeah. - How? Where? Sort of like... like in the family. Are you happy? 'Cause I'm happy like mad! Of course I am. What's this you're wearing? What's in there? Rocks? Something for you. Surprises. Mimi, Queen of Clouds. Wow! Great! Kasia, a naturist. Nice to meet you. I'm more into abstract painting, but nature is also exciting. I like to paint clouds. And you? Nails, Your Highness. Call me Kasia. Call me Mimi. We can share a room if you want. How come? How come? - You're wearing no panties? - I sure am. Mom saw to it. Why share? There are never any singles. You normally share a room at workshops. If we arrive early, we can choose the best room. But I smoke. Great. Me too. Let's go. Go ahead. Sit here, Mimi. May I have your cell? Thanks. Mom? How are you? Jan met me at the station. He's so sweet. How's Bunia? Has she eaten up her carrots? Good. Mom gives you a kiss. Hear that, Mom? A lark. No? Shame. It's teeny-tiny. We're in the middle of nowhere. Jan's checking on something. It's all right, Mom. Don't worry. It's so scenic here! The mountains... I'm so happy! Yes, it's a cow. Sure, I'll say hello from you. How's Bunia? Put heron the phone. My little furry thing! Has she reacted? Moved her whiskers? Yes, Mom. Jan also says hello. Bye-bye! Why do you call him Jan? Jan is my boyfriend. Mom likes him a lot. You get it? Not really. It's simple. Mom wouldn't have let me go on my own. Less so with a married man. It's a white lie. I'm all she has. She wears my clothes. Terrific woman, but single. Gets up at 5 am. Every clay, but... she works with women only. It's a hopeless life. That's why she's so focused on mine. And she's happy when I'm happy. Wait, It's ringing. Mom? I love you, Mommy! Give it back! What's going on? She disconnected me. - She'd never have stopped! - I had Mom on the phone! Always the same blah! Outrageous! They're all nuts! Hands off our slaughterhouse! We may eat corn on the cobs, - ...but we will keep our jobs! - Bravo! - That's art at its best! - Art? You're kidding! - It's a happening. - Polish meat is best to eat! He looks familiar. A colleague from another workshop? How are you? - Where are you guys from? - Warsaw Division of Artists' Union. Hey, listen! Warsaw has sent in delegates! Hey, listen! Warsaw has sent in delegates! Aren't they wonderful? Look at this one. How innovative! You're sassy, too! Congratulations! It's some comedy! It's theater of form! The avant-garde has moved - ...to the provinces! - You're mocking the idea of strike! Polish meats are good, Old Polish are better. Let's join them! Come along! They're calling us. Artists should stick together. They're butchers! Can't you see? I can't see what he sees in you. May I ask you something? - Why did you take her along? - She's lonely. I promised her this ride. - Also, it's a good excuse for us. - I see! Cool! I hope she won't sleep with us. No.We're dropping her off. Good/Cause I have a couple of surprises for you. Where is she now? She joined them. You must be joking! - Isn't it too hard on your feet? - I'm wearing sneakers. They're butchers, not artists. Sure. Butchers on strike. - I'm not some blind idiot! - Then what are you doing here? And what is she doing here? Keeping an eye on my car. And using your cell! Why did you take her along? She makes me feel good. - Her legs are not that bad. - Not just the legs. She's... - She's... - Forget the word? It runs in the family. She's joyful, that's the word. And she wants nothing from me. Do I want anything from you? Other than not catching a chill? Where's your hat? It's crazy! I can't believe it... What is it that you want? - Just for you to be happy. - Then let's get out of here. - Can we just walk out on them? - We'll start buying their sausages. Mom, life is beautiful! How are you, Mom? Gee, hold on... There's some water! What is it? The Amazon! It's just great, Mom. No problems at all, trust me. Water again! Awesome! I'm so happy! It's breathtaking! I will, Mom. There are hundreds of dragonflies! I'll catch one for you. Bye, Mom! Excuse me! One from Mom, one from Bunia. Piotr! Help! Kasia! Help! - Not a living soul. Where's she? - Sleeping like a baby. Wait. It's for you. Even Mom doesn't know. It's because I love you. Must have been by accident. What's the matter? She's jealous! Dog in the manger! - What's happening? - Where? - Why are you honking? - You told me to. - Just in an emergency. - Exactly. I woke up and didn't see you. So I panicked. - Son, I really fear for you. - Read my lips. - I'm not your son. - No? No. And stop playing a fool. You're not my mother, I'm not Jacek. Go to the back. Now! Are you hungry? No? Good. Stay in the car then. Can I give it a wash? What can I have? Call Mom. You're a darling! Mom? We're in a fabulous restaurant. I'll read the menu. Herring Hungarian style. Hungarian. I swear. I couldn't lie to you. Mom doesn't know it. Go to the mains. I'm starved. With that herring I'll be fine. I'll have a Czardas cutlet. Jan's having a cutlet, 28 zlotys... Stop calling me Jan! I'm serious: 28 zlotys! Wait... Mom's asking where you have all this money from. I stole it. A scholarship for achievements in sports. She says we'd better share the main. Why does she keep calling you Jacek? It's her son's name. - He died young 30 years ago. - How do you know? She has his pictures everywhere. A mountain climber. So she thinks you're her son! Oh my God! What? She's pretending she thinks so. She knows I'm not her son, but she wants to persuade me that. Why? As her son I'd have to take care of her. But you are taking care of her! And how! Giving her a helluva ride! Smart cookie, isn't she? So, what's your address? 14 Debowa St. Where's that? Across the railroad. So, you forgot to turn off the gas? My fruit stew is on. And? I'll burn the pot! Call your son if you live together. Use my phone. My son's car has no roof. I like yours. It's like looking down from the clouds. Does it use much gas? You have an I.D.? You think I don't know who ate Little Red Riding Hood? 7 x 8=56. I have a wolf's memory! I may be at a loss for words every now and then, I may be at a loss for words every now and then, Never. What are you guys up to? Are you blind? Are you talking to me? Let her off. Here's your tip. Stick it up yours! I'd rather be an orphan than have a mother like you! It's your fault. We were to go to Brazil. - Brazil? - My sister... sent the money from Rio, but he says he lost it! Why blame me then? He's lying. He'll lock me up in a nuthouse to go to Brazil with you! I swear we're not going to Brazil. Mom wouldn't allow me to fly. Then why are you dressed like this? I'm barely reseed at all! Exactly. 'Cause it's hot in Rio! Mimi, please! Don't abandon us. Herzlich wilkommen! To the restrooms? Follow me. I've never seen a place like this! I've been here before. With his father. I must cool off. Got a smoke? - I'm speechless! - If the prince will receive us, we'll have to change. Luckily I have my pearls. What prince? Sanguszko. He always welcomes workshop participants in person. He'll even kiss each girl's hand. - You like it? - It's OK. Good. What do you say? Fabulous. Come on. - Holy cow! What's in there? - Surprises. - Is it far to the upper castle? - 2 miles. Make a left. Just a second... That strike... Fantastic. I'll never forget you. - She's not coming along? - No. You're distracting me. I'll lose the way. Impossible! I can smell the sea. I have a cools nose! It's here? Excuse me, where's the restroom? My son had a Czardas cutlet on our way from Warsaw and it upset his stomach. We've already had dinner. Weird. Must be sculptors. Sculptors are always like that. - Guess what. - What? - Senility, that's what it is! - What's the matter? A box of chocolates! For whoever runs the workshop. You shouldn't come empty-handed. Praised be Jesus Christ. I'm Sister Barbara. My sister's name's also Barbara. The room is ready. No-no! This is not allowed! I'll feed seagulls on our way to Brazil. All right. Just today. It's a beautiful view... You like it? Nice. Very nice. I've heard the forecast. Western wind, which means clouds. Imagine, Your Highness: Dozens and dozens of clouds! Is Kasia staying in the palace? You can paint here, no need to go downstairs. When you have, say, 15 pictures ready, we'll make an exhibition. Come on, Mimi! What's wrong? - Hey, scout! - I won't sing anymore. Sing as much as you like. I promise to be good in the car and home. I promise to be good in the car and home. Scout's honor! I must go. When will you come? Here's $2,000. She wanted to go to Brazil to see her sister Barbara. But Barbara died recently. I didn't have the courage to tell her. She loved her so. Together in the scouts and in the uprising. She's all alone now. I don't know how long it's good for. A year? Nobody. I bought a house from her. A ruin. Needs a lot of work. She believes or claims to believe that I'm her son. But I'm not. Please take care of Piotr, Virgin Mary, my adopted son. Spare him the sufferings of hunger, disease, war and poverty. Are you ready? Yes or no? How could you afford this? The panties are Angelika's. This is Moms - a Xmas present she never wore. And the bra is Krysia's - a bit tight, this one. They offered the best they had because they know I love you and they're happy when I'm happy. It took me 2 weeks to put this show together. So? I'll make you a top model. I want nothing from you. I know. But if you said you loved me... But if you said you loved me... ...I'd know how to live. How? I hate myself for lying to her. I'm calling her to make up for it. It's just 3 words - not much. Please! It is much to me. A serious commitment. To do what? To stay with you. You don't have to get divorced. Really. As long as I know you love me, I'll be OK. You'll pay Mimi visits and I'll go everywhere with you. I love these rides of ours. I'll give you this car. That's mean! I couldn't even afford the gas. So? Do you love me? Do you? Your last chance... You hear me? Aren't you stubborn? Tough life for whoever marries you. What time is it? Ten after midnight. May I have your phone? Mom? Best wishes! What's the occasion? Mother's Day, what else? Yes, 10 minutes now. I love you. I love you, Mom! You know what I wish you... Find your Mr. Right and let him love you. This was from Mom. You don't like it? There's no choice. You'll like it when you get hungry. There's no choice. You'll like it when you get hungry. What's going on here? Breakfast for you. - I couldn't eat now. - Stomach again? - Hangover. - Have some soured milk. Prince Sanguszko's remedy. May we get some? Sorry, they didn't have better brands. Chocolates! She'll be delighted. - They're not for her. - For whom then? You. Why? Good morning! Back from Rio? Do you remember me? Endless combinations! Each cloud is different. A turtle, heavy with rain, its braids shedding flowery tears... My lunch break is almost over. Just some finishing touches. I think I've captured it. The clouds... Very important. I LOVE YOU. Mom! Can you hear me? Cast (in order of appearance): Everybody's so happy! I'll give Piotr a kiss from you! I love you! Bye! English Subtitles: Grazyna Bialik
