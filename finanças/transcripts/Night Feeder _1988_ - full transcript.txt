Look, I heard the sirens. What do you expect? - I thought we had this place cordoned off. You got credentials, lady, or a good reason for being here? - Yes, Inspector, I do, as a matter of fact. - All right, just stow it. Yeah, looks like it. Some wacko out there. - That makes three in two weeks. - So, it does. What paper did you say you were with? - [Jean] I didn't. - Now, look, much as I've been enjoying our little conversation, reporter lady, I've gotta get back to work. - Wait a minute, Inspector. Is there something a little weird about the body? - What you got, Steve? - Nothing, Lonzo, and I think that's about all we're gonna get tonight. - Yeah, all right, look-- - Both you and the coroner were acting like it was. - Let's pack it in. Come back tomorrow when we've got some light, huh? - Good idea. (Alonzo groans) - Pardon me. - Wait a minute, Inspector. - Excuse me. - Wait a minute. Look, it's not just that I'm a reporter. I live in this neighborhood. I just moved in around the corner about two months ago, and nobody told me when I did it was open season on women. - Let me tell you something. If I lived in this neighborhood, I think I'd take a long vacation, go visit my in-laws. And I've been divorced for five years. Think about it.

Nice party you're havin' here. - Yeah, thanks, it's pretty interesting. - Yes. - Hey, you still work at the coroner's office? - Yes, I am. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. - [Nathan] Still working at the coroner's office. - How's the baby? - He's sleeping in Bryan's room. (Zac laughs) - I hope you ain't driving home. - Now, I want you to tell me which one is Bryan. The lead guitarist over there? - No, no, he's the bass player. He's the tall, blond one. - [Marcia] Oh! - Marcia! - Oh, he's so good! (pop rock music) You know, Jean, I'm just so impressed with you. I mean, I really think you have a lot of guts. - Why, 'cause I threw this party? Let me tell you something, my friend, there's method to my madness. You know, I'm writing that article on crime and fear in American cities. I figure if people in the neighborhood know who I am they might be more willing to talk to me, you know? - No, I didn't mean that. I mean, I think you were just so brave to leave David when he wouldn't accept your career. And now you're living in this fantastic loft. (laughs) And you've got this incredible relationship with Bryan. I mean, it's a whole new life. (pop rock music) (suspenseful music) (Jean yawns) - Oh God. Is everybody gone? (Bryan groans) - I think so. (Jean chuckles) - Unusual bunch, huh? - You must be crazy, hanging up signs like that. (Jean chuckles) - Would you get me a cigarette, sweetie? (Bryan groans) - This stuff will kill you. - You're so weird, Bryan. What would adolescent American do, if she found out Bryan Soulfield was a health nut, hm? - Sit on her fat tooshie and spin for all I care. (Jean laughs) - Did you see Marcia leave? - Ngh-ngh. - Last time I saw her, she was going to the bathroom to throw up. (both laughing) - Shit! (objects crashing) Oh God, shit, shit! - Shit, I must have left the downstairs door open. - Oh, great, great, with a murderer on the loose. (thrilling music) (door creaking) - You invite half the universe in here and you give 'em free run of the place. Jesus Christ. What makes you think that the murderer didn't come too? (thrilling music) (dramatic music) - (whispers) Oh God, oh God! (curtains clattering) - (whispers) Whoa. (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (liquid splashing) (thrilling music) (pen cap clicking) - So, decided to throw a little party for the neighborhood. Oh, that's great. Though, in my opinion, your guest list could have used a little improvement. - Now look. - Wait, Inspector. Was it the same, with all the others? I mean, with the eye like that? - Let's just say that we are dealing with a serious nutcase here. All right, let's get on to the people attending this party of yours. - I... I've gotta call Ted. - Huh? - No, it's her husband, please. - (sighs) Go. You're Bryan Soulfield, aren't you? - Congratulations, Inspector. Most people over 25 don't recognize me. - Oh, I've got a niece who thinks that you and your pals are hot stuff. - We're not that bad. Our bark is worse than our bite. - Mm-hmm. Well, tell me something. How long have you and your reporter friend been together? - We're not exactly together. - Well, what does that mean? - Well, she moved in here a couple of months ago. It's more casual. - [Alonzo] Casual. Your definition or hers? - Both of ours. - Does she know about you? - About what? - The women, Bryan, the women. - Look, just because some broads that used to hang out at our rehearsals get themselves stiffed doesn't mean we off them, get it? - No, not yet, music man, but you can bet your guitar that I will. - He's in some remote border area. They can't get through to... Uh, is something going on? - Not a thing. Let's get going on this list, all right? - Same thing, Lonzo. Cavity's clean as a whistle. I'll send you the coroner's report. - Cavity? That means her brain, right? Her brain's gone, is that what that means? - Now, listen to me. You remember a couple of days ago, off the record? Promises I am expecting you to keep? Now, you just heard something you were not supposed to hear. We both know there's a story here, but it's just gonna have to wait. (thrilling music) (forklift clanging) - [George] Oh, shit! (forklift buzzing) (forklift crashing) (man groans) - Hi! - Hi. - You look like a man who'll talk to the press. - Oh yeah? - Yeah? - Sure. - My name's Jean. I live in the neighborhood, I'm a writer. I'm doing a series about the murders in the neighborhood. Would you be willing to talk to me? - Sure. - Great. What's your name? - My name is George. George. Oh, I know who you are. - Yes? - You're the person that had that party. I was there. - [Jean] So, was everyone else. - How'd it feel to find a body in your bathtub? - How did you know it was in the bathtub? - Ah, everybody in the neighborhood knows that. Well, how was it like? - It wasn't very pleasant, George. She was a friend of mine. Tell me something, George. You don't seem to be too worried that there's a crazy person running around in the neighborhood killing people. Why is that? Is it because you just work here or do you live here also? - No, I live here, I live here. I work here, too, but why should I be scared? - Excuse me, I wonder if I could have a moment of your time. I'm a magazine writer, I live in the neighborhood. I'd like to talk to you about-- - I'll scream. - I beg your pardon? - I'll scream! - I just want to talk to you, I'm not gonna hurt you! (thrilling music) This is the second person today who has been too frightened to stop and talk to me. Perhaps they think that any stranger could possibly be the murderer. I don't know. (heels clacking) Hi, I'm Jean. - Hi. - We met at the-- - Oh, Jean Michaelson, right? Yeah, I was at your party, that was great. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, that must've been horrible for you, wasn't it? I mean, everything that happened that night. It was awful. I'm really sorry to say it, but I'm kind of glad we left early. - Well, actually I'm glad you left too. Actually, I'm a writer. I'm doing a magazine article on the atmosphere of fear in the neighborhood as a result of these murders. Would you be willing to give me your thoughts on it? As a woman and as a mother? - I think it's just a disgrace. - Mm-hmm. - You can quote me on that. I mean, this is obviously some kind of maniac we're dealing with. And as far as I'm concerned, I mean, the police just aren't doing enough to protect the citizens. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, you'd think a maniac would be easy enough to catch, right? I mean, he can't look normal. I think the police are scared to death themselves. - [Jean] Mm-hmm. - I'd really love to talk more, but I've gotta go. - All right. - I'll see you around, all right? - Thank you very much for your help, Victoria. - Sure. - All right, take care. - Bye. - Bye! (thrilling music) Excuse me, sir? Sir? (thrilling music) (suspenseful music) (paper rustling) (pencil tapping) (suspenseful music) (motor humming) (car door slamming) (bag rustling) (toothbrush scraping) (bag rustling) (hand knocking) (suspenseful music) (hand knocking) David. - Hi. - David! (hand rubbing) David. Hi. - Hi. - Oh, David, would you like to come in? - Oh, no, I figured I'd give the floor a brush. Yeah, I got some wine, some cheese. - Come in. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (both laughing) - So, this jerk says to me, he says, "Hey, I can get you a better deal than that." To me, his lawyer. (laughs) Oh, so I say, "Is that what you did to Smolensky?" He says, "Smolensky? "My pigeon was Shorty Hughes." - No! (both laughing) - I was gonna put this guy on the stand. (laughs) Oh, Jean, this isn't working. I want you back, and I think you want to come back. - David. (sighs) - Wait, wait, wait, now hear me out. Remember when I was into running? Christ, I was into running like a crazy man. I mean, it was an obsession. It went on for what, three years? - Hmm. - I am still amazed that I did that. - Mm-hmm. - You know, I still run. I'm not crazy. I don't keep diaries and I don't keep records, and I don't calculate my times. I don't figure out how many track sessions it'll take to peak for what rates. - (sighs) Okay. - I was thinking about that and about us. And what I realized is that I really want you back. I mean, things that seem so important, man, just aren't now. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. David, are you comparing my work with your obsession about running? Is that what you're saying? No, wait a minute. Are you saying that I might be a good risk to take back now because I might just get over this silly idea I have about writing? - No, this isn't-- - No, no. Don't use this lawyer shit on me. I know that's what you're saying. - Jean. - Stop it! I'm trying to talk to you! You seem to need somebody in your life to dominate, and I just cannot live that way anymore, David. Don't you see? I lived with you for seven years. I don't even know who you are. And you sure as hell don't know me, now... Just leave, David, please. - Go! - All right! (sighs) Be safe, okay? - Yes. - Now, remember that I love you. I wish you could see that. - David, please. Just go. (door creaks) (suspenseful music) (pencil tapping) (Jean sighs softly) (suspenseful music) (water spraying) Oh man. (water spraying) (Jean sighing) David? (dramatic music) David. (footsteps pattering) Oh God, no! No, god! Oh God, no! Oh, no, please! (cries) No! (cries) (suspenseful music) (boot heels clacking) (suspenseful music) (grass crunching) - Good afternoon, Ms. Michaelson. - Oh, shit. - I'm sorry to startle you. I realize it's been a rough couple of days. - Are you following me, Inspector? - No, no, it's my day off. I'm just taking a walk. So, tell me, how you doin'? - Surviving. You? - Investigating. Not much to go on unfortunately. So far you seem to be the only lead worth following. (sighs) You know, reporter lady, you would be doing both of us a big favor if you would move away from that neighborhood. - I just moved in. - The other night, when you were giving me your list of party guests, neither you or Bryan mentioned that the name of his band is Disease. - So? - So, Bryan also gave his last name as Walsh. - His last name is Walsh. Soulfield is a stage name. - Okay, I'll buy that. But saying that Disease is just a band is sorta like saying Hitler was an overzealous politician. - Isn't that a little farfetched, Inspector? - Is it? Did you know that they were involved in another murder investigation? I guess Bryan never bothered to tell you about those three young female fans of his who died, well, a little suddenly a couple of years of ago. - He told me all about those three groupies that OD'ed, Inspector. Look, it wasn't their fault. Even if Bryan personally gave the drugs to those girls, it wasn't their fault. - Well, let me put it this way. I don't think they lost any money because of the attention about this. Even those three groupies dying wasn't too bad for business. Kids love that stuff. Notoriety, scandal. They think that ODing on experimental drugs is mankind's highest achievement. - You sound a little bitter, Inspector. Do you have kids? - No. No, my ex and I were never blessed, but I do have a niece. She's got your boyfriend's picture plastered all over her walls. - Jealous? - I want you to be careful. Traipsing around your neighborhood asking questions right now is sort of like putting a sign up saying, "Here I am, come and get me." - It also says, "Come and talk to me." - (sighs) Granted. I dunno, I guess it's difficult for me to understand why someone like you would put yourself in danger. - Look, Inspector, haven't you ever put yourself in danger in the line of your work? - Of course, I have. That's what I get paid for, catching bad guys, protecting people like you. - So, what you're saying is what you're doing is important, but what I do isn't, is that what you're saying? Look, Inspector, a lot of people read my articles, and they get upset that whole neighborhoods full of decent people are living in fear. And a couple of those people might try to do something about it. And one of them might actually make your job easier. - Scratch a reporter, find an idealist, right? - Scratch a cop, find a cynic. You scratch a cynic, you find a tarnished idealist. Maybe you oughta invest in some silver polish, Inspector. It might do you some good. Excuse me. (birds chirping) (tools banging) (men chattering) - Listen, you guys. I want you to take that plaster out of these offices, okay. 'Cause I want to get that sheet rock all put in tomorrow. All right? - All right. - Yeah, what about that big ass hole in the roof, man? Almost fell through that son of a bitch yesterday. - Big loss, put a board over it, asshole. - Okay, okay. - Okay? Listen, I'm gonna work late tonight. So I'll fix the hole in the roof for you little girls, okay? - Victoria, hello. - Hi. - [Jean] It's nice to see you again. - You too. - How's the baby? - Oh, he's just fine. - You look a little tired. - Yeah, I guess I am a little. I guess it's these deaths. - Ooh baby! - Mamasita! - [Victoria] Did you know the last one was right near your house? - Ooh, Mama! - [Jean] Yes, it was close, right in front of my house. - Anyone wanna help me work on the floor tonight, huh? (men laughing) Oh, come on, honey, don't be that way, huh? - Check out my shoe size, yeah. (men laughing) - Hey, why don't you ladies come inside. I'll show you some plumbing. (laughs) - [Victoria] I hope I was able to be of some kind of help to you or something. - Yes, you were, you were a lot of help. Thank you very much. - [Worker] Maybe they'll come over and talk to us, huh? Hey, baby! - This is a little silly. I hope I can talk to you about it later sometime, all right? - Okay. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) I think we really better be going. It's probably a good idea. - Okay, you're right. - All right. - See you later, Jean. - Bye-bye. - Hey, Frankenstein? What are you doing over there? I said, hey, Frankenstein! Oh God, get out of here, you slimebag! Shit! I said, get the fuck outta here, you freak! I said get away! - No, leave him alone! (bottle shattering) (man groaning) - [Worker] Ooh, man! See that freak jump when the bottle hit him? - [Worker] Yeah, sounded like a goosed elephant. Oh boy. (growls) I'm the creeper! The creeper's coming to get ya! - Oh, Jesus. - Jesus Christ. That guy gives me the creeps, man. Besides that, he's scaring all the women away. Shit, give me a beer, huh? Come on, give me a beer! (suspenseful music) (computer keys clicking) (printer buzzing) (suspenseful music) (trash rattling) (pencil scratching) (phone ringing) (Jean coughs) - Hello? - Hey, babe. - Hi, Bryan. - [Bryan] Hey, keep it down, guys. Get that stuff outta here, Zac. - Huh? - Yeah. - How's LA? - [Bryan] Oh, you know La La Land. - Yeah. - [Bryan] A lot happening, fun to see. - How's the gig? - Pretty good, it's good. - Hmm? - [Bryan] Some guys from the label, you know, they came by. - Really? - Yeah, like our stuff. - That's great. - [Bryan] Yeah, but I'll be here an extra day. - Oh. - Tie up some loose ends. I hope you're not disappointed. - Well, it doesn't thrill me, sweetie. I mean, I miss you and under the circumstances, I really don't enjoy being here alone. (suspenseful music) You know, if you got a shot at a record contract, go for it. - [Bryan] Yeah are you still working on the article, babe? - Yeah, it's going fine. I'm in the middle of the second article. (suspenseful music) Well, I don't really know, but I'm getting an idea. What, oh, okay, okay. Well, I'll talk to you about it when you get home. - Yeah-- - All right, see you tomorrow. - Yeah, will do. - Yeah. - Love you. - Love you too, bye. (suspenseful music) (tape clicking) - [Victoria] It's just a disgrace. You can quote me on that. I mean, this is obviously some kind of maniac we're dealing with. And, as far as I'm concerned, I mean, the police just aren't doing enough to protect the citizens. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, you'd think a maniac would be easy enough to catch, right? I mean, he can't look normal. I think the police are scared to death themselves. I'd really love to talk more, but I've gotta go. (tape clicking) (suspenseful music) (train humming) (ladder clanging) (man muttering) (man mutters) - Oh shit, damn. (mutters) Ugh. God. Well, gotta get to work. (latter clanging) Gotta replace this. (hand banging) Ah, shit, gotta get all of this? God. Get this thing outta here. (man groans) (tool clangs) (man groans) ♪ I'm a king bee ♪ (dramatic music) Hello? Shit. Hey! You kids! (dramatic music) Someone in there? Don't fuck with me! (laughs) (ladder clanging) ♪ I'm a king bee ♪ ♪ Buzzing around the old house ♪ ♪ I'm a king bee ♪ (mysterious grunting) (dramatic music) Hey, who's in there? Who is that? Get the. Get outta here, hey! (dramatic music) Who's in there? What is this, huh? You trying to sneak up on old Monty here, huh? Hey! What the? (dramatic music) (creature growling) Holy shit! No, no, no, no! (screams) (eerie slurping) (eerie slurping) - [Worker] Hey, man, the sheet rock get delivered yet? - I've been here 20 minutes already. Nobody here. - Monty's truck's here. - Well, I guess you think the truck's gonna open up the front door. I've told you, there's nobody here. - You sure that door's locked? - Hey man, I know when a door is locked. Jesus. - Well, hell, let's sit here the whole fucking day. We're getting paid. - You got that right. - You know, still, it's weird. I mean, I know Monty's around here somewhere. I can feel him. You know how some guys you could just feel? - Monty wouldn't go anywhere without his truck. I wonder if he fell down when he was working last night. - Oh shit, man, we should've thought of that before! - Yeah, you ain't kidding. - Monty! (hand banging) Hey, Monty! - Hey, we can get in through the basement door! - Come on, man. (men grunting) (boots thudding) Monty! - Hey, Monty. You here? - Come on, man. Damn. Monty! - Monty! - Hey, look over here, man. - Hey, Monty! - Monty! - He's gotta be here somewhere, dude. - [Worker] Yeah, I know, I know. Monty! - [Worker] Where are you, man? (dramatic music) - Whoa, fuck! Oh shit! Oh shit, shit! - Oh God! - Shit! (men shouting) (boots thudding) (dramatic music) (traffic humming) (radio chattering) (boat horns honking) (seagulls cawing) (door creaking) (overhead announcer chattering) - I just don't get it, Mort. I mean, a brain is a solid thing, right? It's a solid object. Then explain to me how it can be sucked out through the eyeball. How can a brain cavity be emptied through the eye socket? It just doesn't make any sense. - You're right, Lonzo. It doesn't make any sense. But someone is doing it the same way every time. (suspenseful music) (skin cracking) (scalpel scraping) (scalpel clanging) (scalp tearing) (scalpel scraping) (scalp tearing) (scalpel scraping) What I don't get is why anyone would do it? - Yeah. So the why we don't have, the how we don't have. Exactly what is it that we do have? - Have you ever seen a human brain, Lonzo? Up close, I mean. - Not recently. - Well, there's one over there in the specimen cabinet. Would you bring it over here please? (suspenseful music) (bone saw buzzing) (scalpel scraping) (scalpel clanging) We've got this every damn time, Lonzo. You see here. The meninges, that's the tough outer covering of the brain. That's intact. Down here, you have the cerebellum and the brainstem. Also intact. What's missing is all the soft tissue that makes up the cerebrum. That's the whole main part of the brain. The brain parenchyma. (liquid splashing) About 900 grams of it. Now, that's a little like pulling a camel through the eye of a needle. You can do it if you melt the camel. And you can get the brain out through the eye if you liquefy it first. In all the others, I'm finding traces of a powerful acid on the meninges. Bet your lunch I find it here too. - Maybe some other time, hey, Mort? Acid, huh? Any idea how it's being injected? - Not yet. - [Alonzo] Well, what else you got, anything? - A couple of things. Bruises about the neck and body. And the brain extraction is the cause of death. (dramatic music) That's right. The killer isn't killing first then taking the brain. He's overpowering the victim and then somehow pulling out the brain. (dramatic music) Something else too. Although I don't know what you can make of it. Besides the acid, I'm finding traces of disease. - [Alonzo] Yeah, what kind of diseases? - No, no, the drug, DZS. - Right, yeah, DZS. That experimental drug, right? - Yeah, that's right. The one they were using for a while to treat paranoid schizophrenia. Dimethylzerbide siathylide. Causes excess release of cortisol and norepinephrine. - [Alonzo] What is that? - Norepinephrine is a neuropeptide. Same effect as cocaine or close enough. It also activates the limbic system. - That was the same stuff that was in those groupie overdoses, right? Disease. - [Morty] What disease, what disease? - No, no, the band, Disease. Don't you remember that Mort? - Oh yes, the three girls. - [Alonzo] Yeah. - But we couldn't get anything because the fire destroyed whatever evidence there might've been. So what? What does that have to do with this? There's plenty of disease to go around, unfortunately. The drug. - Because that goddamn band is involved in this thing. I know it. That warehouse was their rehearsal space. That Bryan Soulfield, scum loser. This guy's wife lives in the other half. - It sounds like you've got yourself a good one, Lonzo. But to kill off four women as a cover for dumping the husband is kind of excessive, don't you think? - Yeah. (groans) That's crazy. Besides, Jean's not involved in this thing. I'd stake my badge on that. So you think what, all these victims were users? They all had this stuff in their systems? - No. It was just sitting in there, like the acid. I think, hell, I know, that whoever took the brain left the disease behind. - I don't know, I just don't get that. (Alonzo sighs) You know, they're coming at us faster now. It's like this guy just can't get enough. (suspenseful music) What the hell is this freak doing with these brains? - Nothing probably, Alonzo. Looks to me like we're just dealing with one more kind of maniac. (suspenseful, jarring music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Alonzo] Hello, Ms. Michaelson, this is Inspector Bernardo. - Hello, Inspector. - [Alonzo] While we're at it, you happen to think of anything? - Well, I guess I was just thinking about our last conversation. What can I do for you? - [Alonzo] I'd like to ask you a few questions. - Mm-hmm. - [Alonzo] Have you seen any increased disease activity in your neighborhood? - No, wait the band DZS or the drug? - [Alonzo] The drug, DZS. It's a powder compound like cocaine. - I know what it looks like, Inspector. I've been around a little bit. - [Alonzo] Listen. (mutters indistinctly) - Uh huh. - DZS is nasty stuff. - Uh huh. - [Alonzo] The last victims, they were users too. - So, why all this interest in narcotics all of a sudden? I thought you were homicide. - [Alonzo] Uh, sorry, I gotta go. It's a police emergency. - Such a pleasant, man. (phone ringing) - Coroner's office, supply. - Oh, Nathan? - Jean, how did you get this number? - [Jean] Nathan, look, I need help, fast. - You can't be calling me here. - [Jean] I want you to find out if there's a DZS connection to the murders, would you? - You can't call me here, I could lose my job. - [Jean] Disease, DZS. - Are you going to pay me? (suspenseful music) (door creaking) (footsteps pattering) - [Bryan] So, Jean. - Hi. - Hey, babe. Working? - No, no, it's fine. Hi, welcome home, I missed you. (lips smacking) What? - Listen, we didn't have any sort of agreement, really. (footsteps pattering) - Hey, Bryan. Well, hi. I'm Debbie Laxler. You didn't tell me you shared your place. - Um, Jean's a writer, a journalist. She lives in this part. - (chuckles) And never the twain shall meet. Well. So, Debbie, tell me. Has Bryan told you about the murders we've been having here in this neighborhood? - Murders? - Yeah, in fact, the last two happened not 100 yards from where you're standing right now. (dramatic music) - Thanks for taking care of everything, Jean. I'll buy you a beer later. (footsteps pattering) - [Debbie] So, tell me about these murders. - [Bryan] Shut up, Debbie. (hand banging) - Shit! (organ music) - Has not man a hard service upon earth, and are not his days like the days of a hireling? Like a slave who longs for the shadow. and like a hireling who works for his wages. So, I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me. (elegiac organ music) When I lie down, you say, when shall I arise? The night is long, and I am full of tossing through the dark. My flesh glows with worms and dirt. My skin hardens and breaks out fresh. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope. (elegiac organ music) - That eulogy was straight out of a horror movie. So, where's your boyfriend? - There's no such animal. - Thank you all for coming. Since Marcia's husband Ted cannot be with us this morning, Jean Michaelson has asked that you all sign this guestbook. - Big bad Bri, where is he? - He's in LA. - Oh, I heard he was back in town. - Well, then you know more than I do. - Hollingsworth? - Oh, dear, that's just finished. Perhaps you could attend the burial. I'm sorry, sir. The graveside ceremony option was not taken. - Option? Where is she, goddamn it? Where's my wife? - She's down there, but, sir, you can't go! - [Ted] Marcia! - Ted. - You were just gonna leave her here, weren't you? You were all gonna get in your cars and drive away. Let her lie here till the tall guys from the cemetery come and pick her up, right? Right? - Ted. - How come, Jean? Can't you even put her in the goddamn ground? - Now, Ted, you listen to me. - No! Why should I listen to you? You can't even take her to the goddamn cemetery. - Mr. Hollingsworth. - Shut up. - Ted, please. - You were just gonna leave her here, weren't you? Leave her here, all alone, my baby. (lips smacking) I wanna see her, I wanna see her. - Ted. - Marcia. - Ted! (fist banging) - Marcia, I wanna see her! (Jean screaming) (coffin lid crashing) (women screaming) (dramatic music) (traffic humming) (suspenseful music) (water dripping) (shoes dragging) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (car door slamming) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (cars humming) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (Creeper grunting softly) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) (Creeper grunting) (fire crackling) (Jean gasps) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) (Creeper grunting) (fire crackling) (Jean gasps) (distant rattling) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (car door slamming) (engine revving) (tires skidding) (mellow electric guitar music) (crowd chattering) - All right, people! What do you say we got this meeting started, huh? First off, my name is Alonzo Bernardo. I'm the chief inspector on this case, and I want you to know that I'm available any time, day or night, and can be reached through the downtown precinct. Now, I know you folks are upset, and you've got every right to be. - You damn right. - All right, I understand that you want to hear some reassurance from the department that we're on top of things. - [Woman] Yeah! - Well we are! - Exactly. - That's right, that's right! - Hey, you guys got any real leads? You running around in circles or what? - This is a tough and ugly situation that our community is in, but new pieces of the puzzle are coming in every day and sooner or later... - Saw your piece this week. Not bad. - Thank you. - Certainly not gonna do your career any harm. - Until this investigation is concluded. - It doesn't look like your best is good enough. - [Man] That's right. - That cop Bernardo, what's he like to deal with? Oh, you didn't get much out of him, did you? I wonder if he's ambitious enough to do a little talking to the old press. (people chattering) - All right, listen up. ♪ Suicide Child ♪ (electronic rock music) ♪ Suicide child ♪ ♪ He went away, back to LA ♪ ♪ He couldn't cope ♪ ♪ Still on dope ♪ ♪ My suicide child ♪ ♪ Rot in your grave ♪ (people chattering) - Almost as much as you are! (people chattering) How about some support here, huh? - You know, I think the cops are gonna need a little bit of prodding on this one. It sure is a hell of a story. - Maybe the police can tell us exactly what they're gonna do to protect this community. - Yes. - Yeah! - Yes, I can. Neighborhood patrols have-- - You're a real asshole, Robinson, you know that? It was Robinson, wasn't it? - I would like to expect a little cooperation from you in the neighborhood, all right? - It's guys like you who give the press a bad name. You go around stirring people up, getting them all upset for no reason. - Look who the hell is talking. Aren't you the one that's been running around this neighborhood whipping up the masses. And that piece you wrote wasn't exactly the valley criminal, was it? (people chattering) - Now you're gonna see more uniforms in this neighborhood than you ever have before. - Hey, that's terrific, but you know what in the hell these uniforms supposed to be looking for anyway? ♪ Damn, damn ♪ ♪ Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, slit your wrist ♪ ♪ You fuckin' bitch ♪ ♪ My suicide child, my suicide child ♪ ♪ You stole my junk, you're loaded punk ♪ ♪ Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, slit your wrist ♪ ♪ You fuckin' bitch ♪ ♪ My suicide child, my suicide child ♪ (people chattering) - Will be investigated each and every week. - [Reporter] Channel Five, Eyewitness News. Get your mic in there. - To your case. - Holy shit, how'd he do it? I mean, I mean, we've seen Monty, you know. With his eye gone and all. - That's right. - I mean, it was gone! How'd he do it, man? That's what I want to know, what happened to him? - Truth is, we don't know exactly how it was done. What we do know is that the same method was used in all of the recent killings. - [Man] What was the method? (people chattering) - The brains from all the victims were removed. (people shouting) - Hey, what about that Frankenstein guy? The one that crawls around and eats garbage? - [Man] Yeah! (people chattering) - He had a run in with Monty the day Monty got killed. - Right. - The creeper. That's what I call him. The creeper, man, that's who did it. The creeper. (people chattering) - Talking about how scared we all are. Well, I want to know how she thinks she's helping the situation by grabbing people on the street, scaring them half to death, spreading all these rumors all over the country. Maybe the police should be speaking to her! (people shouting) - If you press people really want to help, why don't you go uptown and get the mayor, drag his ass down here, so we can get this goddamn killer off the streets! Because you know the police aren't gonna arrest this guy. - We are investigating each and every legitimate suspect. (electric guitar music) - We don't know who the killer is, he could be anybody. You know, Jean's got a new slant on that thing. I call it-- - People, the important thing is. (crowd shouting) - It says right here they found that DZ stuff in the brain. - You're talking about that band, George. (crowd chattering) - Drug addict! ♪ Damn, damn ♪ - Disease. - That's the one that killed those groupies a while back. ♪ Damn, damn ♪ - Bernardo, what about those freaks anyway?

Now, we've got a lynch mob to contend with as well as a maniac. - Look, I didn't think people were gonna connect the drug to Bryan's band. And I didn't expect people to act like-- - You know, you're so intent on protecting your little lover boy, you're not using your head. - He is not my lover boy. He doesn't even know what's going on here. - Oh, that's right, he's safe 'cause he's in LA, right? - Right. - I've got a question for you, Jean. - That's all you've ever got is-- - And I expect a straight answer! Where'd you get the goddamn story, who's the leak? - That is privileged information. - Is it my department or the coroner's, that's all I want to know? - What are you gonna do, Alonzo, beat me up, huh? - All right, all right, all right. Just cool it, Lonzo. (sighs) Look, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hurt you. I will change the subject, for now. Let's go round about your boyfriend one more time. - He's not my boyfriend. - Well, let's define him then. What the hell is he, is he a plaything, what? - All right, that's exactly what he is. He's a sexual toy meant to make me feel better about myself. Meant to make me feel I'm still desirable even though I'm separated and over 30, all right? Is that honest enough for you or is that too much? - I'm keeping up with you so far. And you are desirable as hell, by the way. Look, let's back off of on this thing, huh? I'm going nuts here. All right, if he's really not your boyfriend, how about having dinner with me? (mellow rock music) - That's really good. That's great. Listen, let's take a break. - [Lead Singer] All right. - That really wiped me out. I'm gonna take a walk or something. Get some fuckin' air. I'll see you later. - So Deb, did you like that last one? - Yeah, really hot. - (laughs) Hot. Better than the best. We're still going straight up, straight up! - Are you okay? - (groans) It wasn't our fault. - I remember you guys. That something happened. Couple of years ago, right? - Yeah, that's right. Something happened. A couple of really dumb chicks used to hang around. They died. (jarring music) - Didn't they OD or something like that? - Something like that. - Two or maybe three of them. - Yeah. Really dumb chicks. And then there was the fire. (suspenseful music) (laughs) Listen, Deb. I've got something I know you're really gonna love. You ever heard of disease? - Yeah, I have. - But you haven't tried it, have you? Disease is like the darkest night. And then all of a sudden, man is like thousands of little stars going supernova, and they all explode, and it's dark and empty again. And your head starts to grow. And you you know you could have run the world, and you want to run right out and do it. And you could and you should, but you it's daylight and that's when you run home again. Then it's like the darkest night. (laughs) Hey, you're gonna love it, Debbie. Especially with me, I can take you there. - Yeah, thanks, Zac. Maybe another time, okay? - [Alonzo] So tell me, have you ever before had a plaything like with Bryan? - No. No, I haven't really. Well, I guess I just want to see what it was like. David had them, lots of them. Plus, he had obsessions. Skiing, sailing, running. He did the sports just to meet the women, but then he'd become so obsessed with the sport that he forgot why he started it in the first place. - Did you mind? - Of course I minded. Every woman minds. - She, like you, ought to move to a safer neighborhood. (sultry music) - [Jean] You keep telling her that, Inspector. (sultry music) (quirky music) (footsteps pattering) (guests chattering) - Are you finished here? - Yes, thank you. - Listen, can we have a couple more beers here? - Sure. - I'm not quite ready. So, how'd you become a cop? - Hmm. It's funny that. My older brother Don wanted to be one and, well, he never could. I guess I did it for him, at first anyway. - What did you want to be? - Cowboy. (Jean laughs) When all is said and done. Thank you. It wasn't that much of a switch. - I wanted to be a ballet dancer. - Oh. - But I was really bad at it. (both laughing) Then I discovered writing in junior high school. I've never wanted to do anything else since. - Well, that's funny. You had a career then when David met you? I mean, I sort of had the impression that you started writing after you were married. - No, no, I've always worked. David has a great capacity for deluding himself. He always thought of my career as something that I would eventually get over, I guess. - It sounds like he wanted you to be someone else. - You know, there's a lot of truth in that. - Well, you know Doris, I don't even know why she married me. I mean, she didn't know who the hell I was. I don't even think she was all that fond of her fantasy of me. (laughs) - Maybe she just thought you had cute eyes. - Oh yeah? Is that really enough? - Sometimes. (quirky music) (woman chuckles) - Tina, you look wasted. What happened? (Tina laughs) Tina, you be careful. - Why, I could take care of myself. - Okay, fine. (heels clacking) Tina? - Yeah? Yeah? - I need a little lift, you got any? - Oh, I know just what you need. - Yeah? (laughs) Well? (lips smacking) (heels clacking) (suspenseful music) (distant clanging) (suspenseful music) (nose snorting) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (woman panting) (woman screaming) (mysterious slurping) (feet dragging) (thrilling music) - So would you like a nightcap, Inspector? - (sighs) You know what I'd like is if you'd call me Alonzo or Lon. Just about anything but inspector. - Okay. Sounds like you're a little tired of your job. - No. No, I'm just tired of the two of us defining ourselves by who we are in this investigation. I sorta like to enjoy the different context. What do you say? (romantic music) - Point taken. So tell me, Lonzo, do you have playthings? (match striking) - [Alonzo] Who me? I've heard about things like that. - I bet you have. (mouth blowing) - So where does that leave us? (romantic music) (Jean moaning softly) (lips smacking) (dress rustling) (Jean moaning) (lips smacking) (both moaning) (lips smacking) (romantic music) (lips smacking) (Alonzo moaning) (romantic music) (Jean moaning) (both moaning) (romantic music) (lips smacking) (Alonzo sighs) (solemn music) - I wonder what got him started, the murderer. - You're not gonna save the world tonight, Jean. Just go to sleep. (Jean sighs) - I don't know Lonzo. I mean, I know you don't have any evidence, or anything like that, but I just can't... I can't help feeling that, that man, the one they call the creeper, I know he's involved somehow. - No, I think he's just, just a burned out street person, you know? Most of them are harmless. - You know, I feel really bad about what happened tonight. - Thanks a lot. - No, no, not you. Oh, I definitely wanted you to happen. I just didn't know it. (chuckles) No, I mean the goddamn community meeting. (sighs) I just didn't think it would happen like that. Now I've got half the neighborhood convinced that Bryan's involved in the murders somehow. Oh, I had some pretty high-minded fantasies going about writing this series. I was gonna get me a Pulitzer. "Crime and Fear in American Cities." Positively Machiavellian of me. Just kind of staged managed the fear and violence I needed to write about. Alonzo? Hmm? (Jean chuckles) (somber music) (suspenseful music) - [Crowd] Jean. Jean. Jean, Jean. Jean, Jean, Jean. Jean, Jean. (Jean screams) Jean. Jean, Jean. Jean, Jean. Jean, Jean. (Jean screams) - I really think you have a lot of guts, Jean. (Jean gasps) (door creaks) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful music) (Jean whimpers softly) (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (Jean whimpers) - Lonzo! (Marcia grunts indistinctly) (Jean gasps) - [Zac] What is your problem, man? - The problem is you, man. You'd give drugs to your fucking girlfriend's baby. - No, I wouldn't, man, I don't like babies. - [Bryan] Well, what about Mary, what about Martha? What about Flo? - I didn't like them, and I'm starting not to like you. - And what did you do to Debbie, you piece of shit? Where the fuck is she? Where the fuck is Debbie? - I didn't do nothing to Debbie! She left on her own, she walked right out that door! - Bryan, Bryan, I need to talk to you, please. - Not now, Jean. - Bryan please, it's important. - I'll tell you, Bri, you ought to drop that young snatch and pick up on this one again. - Zac. - Her kind of integer will keep you sharp. - Fuck, it is not the time! (Zac laughs) - You're pissing me off, man. - Oh fuck. Bryan, wait! (Zac laughs) (puddle splashes) (suspenseful music) (feet dragging) (Bryan panting) - Debbie! - Bryan, Bryan, wait. Do you know the police are looking for you? - No, but I'm sure you do. - What? - You've got good inside info on what the cops are doing. - Goddamn it, you! (hand slapping) Bryan, I'm sorry, wait. No, look, Alonzo isn't important now! Neither is Debbie. Look, Bryan, please! - Well, you know what, Jean? To her I'm more than just a fantasy fuck. Debbie likes me, Jean. She likes me, get it? Me! - Bryan, wait! Bryan, don't do this! (Zac laughs) (puddle splashes) (suspenseful rock music) - Debbie! (motor humming) Debbie! - Bryan! (suspenseful rock music) (Bryan panting) Bryan? (suspenseful rock music) (footsteps pattering) (suspenseful rock music) - Where'd you go, little girl? Zac's a joker, is all. (suspenseful rock music) You shouldn't comer here all alone, little girl. (suspenseful music) (mysterious squelching) (suspenseful music) (knife clanging) (Creeper grunting) (suspenseful music) - No, no! (Creeper grunting) (feet dragging) (Jean panting) Oh God! (footsteps pattering) (feet dragging) (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (hand banging) Open the door, please! Open the door, let me in, please! Somebody's following me! (hand banging) God, please! Open the door! Please open the door and let me in! Please open the door! Please. - Jean, what's going on? - Victoria. Oh. Let me in, please, there's somebody following me. (door slamming) He's chasing me, that guy. - Who? - The one with the face! Don't you remember the construction site? - Yes. - The guy, yes. - Calm down. - Him! - What is it? - He's chasing me. - No one's chasing you. Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't understand. What do you need? (baby crying) - Lonzo. Lonzo, I need to call Lonzo, please. The phone, the phone! - All right, it's right in here. - Here. Lock the door, don't let him in! I don't, where is it? (baby crying) (phone ringing) (Alonzo groans) Oh shit! Lonzo, pick up the phone! (phone ringing) Please. (phone ringing) Oh God! - Hello? - [Jean] Lonzo, I went outside. There was talking in the street. - Jean? - And the creeper started chasing me, he's got a knife! - Jean, where are you? - What is the address? - Address? - [Jean] The address here! - 11, Number 11 Carleton. - [Jean] Number 11 Carleton, that's the address. Please hurry! (phone receiver clatters) - Are they coming? - Huh? - Are they coming? - Yes. I'm sorry, yeah, I called him. - It's all right. - No, it is not! (baby crying) - [Victoria] You can do this. - I'm sorry. (bay crying) Is he all right? - Oh yeah, he's fine. It's just a little night gas or something, you know. He's coming here to this house? - Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. (baby crying) Is that all right? Oh, oh, oh. I'll wait outside, I'm sorry. - Oh, oh, thank you. - But I need you to let me in if I knock. - Oh, I'm here if you need to come back in. Yeah. - Thank you. (chain rattling) - I'm sorry. - I'll get that. (baby crying) - You sure he's all right? - [Victoria] Oh yeah, he's fine. - Thank you, Victoria. Thank you, honey. - Sure, I'll call you later. - Okay. (door thudding) (baby crying) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) Lonzo? - Jean. Take it easy, huh? Where did you see him last? - I don't know. He was down the street somewhere. Maybe went back to his hole, I don't know. But he had a knife, and he was chasing me. He was making this awful noise. - All right, all right. - Why is that man still on the street? - He won't be for long. Now look, I'm gonna have a cruiser come and get you. And I'm gonna go out and find him. Okay? - No, you're not. No you're not, Lonzo. Now why didn't you pick up that man yesterday, why? - I couldn't find him yesterday. And I didn't have enough to arrest him on then anyway, okay? - Okay. I still think you could've tried harder, okay? He shouldn't be out there. - Maybe you're right, Jean. But just stay here and wait for the cruiser. I will go get it, I promise. - Alonzo, no. I am not going home. - [Alonzo] All right, all right. Get in the car. (car buzzing) - That's it right back there, that hole right there. I know that's where he lives, I saw him. I saw him go in there. - All right, I'm gonna go take a look in there. I want you to stay in the car, just stay in the car. (suspenseful music) (water dripping) - Alonzo. - Jesus Christ! Shh! - I think he lives right down there, I saw him. (suspenseful music) (water dripping) (shoes thudding) (suspenseful music) (water dripping) (shoes thudding) (suspenseful music) (water dripping) - Well, he's not here. (objects crashing) - How can somebody live like this? - Let's get outta here, I'm checking out. (stick rattles) (Jean sighs) (shoes thudding) (suspenseful music) - [Jean] Wait a minute, Alonzo, look! There's something right over there, it's moving. (tires rumbling) (tires skidding) (Creeper grunting) - Stop, I'm a policeman! - Bryan? - Jean! - No, please, no, no! - Stop, or I'll shoot! Goddamn it, stop or I'll shoot! (gunshot blasting) (Creeper groaning) - [Jean] No! (whimpers) - He's dead, Jean. - You bastard! I told you, I told you, I told you! No, it's your fault! You sucker! - Jean! - Let me go, let go of me, no! No! (suspenseful music) - Burned. Burned and badly injured in some terrible accident. Looks like years ago. Maybe napalm. (suspenseful music) I heard you got another one earlier tonight. Some hooker over on Jansen. Pulling 'em in faster and faster now. They couldn't find you. - Yeah, I know, I heard. - I don't know, Lon, there's a problem here. There are no knife wounds. Looks to me like the same cause of death as before. Someone sucked the brain out through the socket somehow. That guy, all he had was a knife. No other tools, no means I can see for doing this. - It wasn't the same as the other ones. I saw him leaning over the body. - Looks to me like you just interrupted the killer before he could finish. (suspenseful music) - What are you trying to say, Mort? (suspenseful music) (footsteps pattering) (hand knocking) - Victoria? It's me again, Jean. I need to talk to you. - Are the police here? - No, no, they're a couple blocks away. There was another murder, but it's all over now. I wanted to talk. - Oh wow. You look completely shattered. You want to come in and talk to me about it? - Thank you. - Tell me what happened. - [Jean] It's all over, I want you to know what happened. Lonzo shot him. Bryan's dead. - Wait, you say it's over? - Yes. - Bryan, wasn't he your boyfriend, the musician? - Yes, he was. - Oh God. Well, listen, stay a few minutes. Let me take your jacket. - Thank you. - All right. - Sit down, have a seat in the chair. Oh God. You know, I thought I heard shots, but you know how it is. It could have been anything. Oh, and you saw all that, how awful for you. Can I get you a cup of tea or something, anything? (suspenseful music) - No, thank you, I just want to sit here a minute. (baby crying) Is he all right? - Oh, he's fine. He's like that every night. - I'm all right, I'm gonna get going. - Oh no, no, rest a few more minutes. You still look really pale, I think you should stay. Besides, you know, there's something I wanted to tell you. I think it's just amazing how you've been involved in all this. And I want you to know that I think you're very, very brave. And I admire you tremendously. - No, I haven't been brave, Victoria. - Oh, yes you are. - It was just my work, I thought I was doing my work. (baby crying) And it got all... I don't know how it happened. (jarring, suspenseful music) (Victoria whimpering) (Victoria muttering) (suspenseful music) (baby crying) (Victoria muttering) (suspenseful music) (baby crying) (Victoria muttering) - Oh God! (baby crying) (suspenseful music) I gotta go. I gotta go home, I can't take that! - No, it's very important that I let you know that. And I want you to know how much I like you. And... I'm really going to miss our conversations, getting to know you. I really truly am going to miss you. (baby crying) - Are you going somewhere? What is the matter with him? (suspenseful music) (taser clicking) (Jean screams) (lamp crashes) (Victoria grunts) (Jean screams) No! No! No! Oh no! (groans) No, no! (suspenseful music) (books crashing) (Victoria groans) (hand banging) (chain rattling) (Jean groans) No! (screams) No! (Victoria grunting) (fabric tearing) (Jean screaming) No! (whimpers) (cradle crashes) (baby cries) (Jean screams) (baby cries) (Jean screams) (Jean whimpers) No, no! (screams) (umbrella tears) (Victoria groans) (women grunting) (Jean screams) - No! (objects crash) No! (glass shatters) (Victoria grunts) No, no! (women grunting) Ow, no! (knife squelches) (Jean screams) (women grunting) (Jean screams) (Jean groans) (suspenseful music) (Jean whimpers) (Jean groans) (rod squelches) (Victoria groans) (Victoria screams) (baby cries) (Victoria cries) (Jean whimpers) (baby cries) (Victoria whimpers) (blood gurgling) (Jean groaning) (baby crying) (phone rattles) No, oh God! No! (fingers banging) No! (eerie gurgling) (suspenseful music) (Jean groaning loudly) (eerie gurgling) (Jean groaning) No! (groans) (eerie gurgling) (suspenseful music) (eerie gurgling) (Jean whimpers) (eerie gurgling) (baby mewling) (thrilling electronic music) (Jean whimpers) (baby mewling) (Jean screaming) No! No, no, God! (baby mewling) (thrilling music) No! No. (baby mewling) No. (baby mewling) (Jean crying) (thrilling electronic music) (baby mewling) No! (baby grunting) (Jean screaming) No! No! No! (baby mewling) (thrilling music) (baby mewling) (Jean whimpers) (baby mewling) (thrilling music) (Jean whimpers) (baby mewling) (Jean screaming) (quirky rock music)
