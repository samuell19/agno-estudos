"is difficult to make them see reason" "The actors that perform in this play..." they do perform a drama Fun and excitement... all the fun and excitement Hurry! It?s time for school Jungle! Rascal! Idiot! - Step on the brakes! "You?re a girl, and you abuse me? - You want me to applaud you?" Why did you push me? - When did I? You ran into me You deliberately rammed into me and now you?re talking back! I know roadside loafers like you. You see a girl and get into the act! Watch your tongue! You broke the button on my shirt... and now you?re calling me a loafer? Where will I get a button from? How about the dress which you spoilt? You know what the laundry bill comes to? Can?t you wash your own clothes? - Had I the time... "I?d show you what else I can wash. - Go, get lost" "Get going! - Go, go away" God! I didn?t know you?d have such daring You came away to Mumbai without telling anyone at home What would you have done if I wasn?t here? It didn?t occur to me at all. Had I stayed there another day... my mother would?ve got me married to the local landlord?s son "So what?s wrong? You have to marry someone, don?t you?" But that chap?s a nut. He?s a real moron My father had borrowed a lot of money from his father... for my education and for my mother?s treatment My father died under the burden of the debt... "and he?s now pestering my mother. He says, if you can?t repay the debt..." have your daughter married to my son He doesn?t even want any dowry. - You mean your life is... the sum total of the debt and the interest So what do you want to do? - I must find a job at any cost I?ve got to repay the debt and get rid of the landlord "Any job will do. - Easier said than done, Anjali" I?m living here with a friend who?s an air-hostess "She?ll be here by 10:30 next Friday. Till then, you can stay here" "But once she arrives, it?ll be difficult for you to live here" "I?m sorry, but you mustn?t take that badly, Anjali" I?ve got enough money to see me through a couple of months If only I could find a room till I find a job Let?s see what we can do. I?m getting late. I must leave When love is one-sided... it?s a punishment "When love is requited, it?s fun" Quiet! We?re talking about life and death and you?re hollering away! "Come around, darling. - No" So it has to do with love! I?ll sing a romantic number... the lady will immediately agree. - I?ve agreed. For a divorce I?m not giving it to you! - I?ve got great number for divorce... but it?s a bit romantic and... - Sing it for your wife! Now sing a song for losses! You?re more of a mosquito repellent! You?ve been driving the customers away "I?ll be a great singer some day, sir. That is my dream" "Pipe-dream. Go away - Today?s the 4th., sir..." When did I say it?s the 34th? - My salary...? I have it all worked out. 300 bucks. Let me have it "But we settled at 4000 rupees. - Sure, we did" You do get a salary of 4000. But who pays for your stay here? Who pays for your food and your laundry? It works out to 4300. Your salary?s 4000. So let me have 300 rupees "But this is a fraud, sir! - Really?" So go and find another job. Get lost! Hey Bholu! Your milk?s getting thinner and thinner every day Are you pouring water in it? "I swear, I?ve never adulterated milk with water" "But yes, I do adulterate water with milk" "Buy it, if you can afford it. Or forget it" "Hello, Nandu! How are you? Why don?t you sing a song as usual?" "Sing, my foot! I?ve heard the mosquitoes singing all night" Don?t you have a mosquito net in the room? "Forget a mosquito net, it doesn?t even have a roof and walls" I slept on the railway platform. - You must think of me at such times I have a great place. It?s going cheap But you?ll need to pay me a commission for that 500 rupees. - I will. But where is it? I?ll show you... do you have a wife? - Wife?! "You know Popat, the moneylender? He lets out his room very cheap" But only to married couples. - Why? Because his wife?s an amazing dish. He?s terribly suspicious about her Where will I find a wife? - Am I not here? You?re crazy! If I tell Popat that you?re my wife... What rubbish! What I?m saying is that I?ll find you a wife I?ll charge extra commission for that. - Are you a milkman... or a commission agent? - I?m an all rounder You indeed are a fast guy Where?s the other lady? - She?s taking a bath Quickly take the milk. I?ve got work to do "You?re the one I was waiting for, Bholu. - What is the matter?" "That?s my friend, Anjali. She?s looking for a room" Low rent. Will you find one? - There is a room. Very cheap But only for married couples Are you married? - No She doesn?t know anyone in town. But Bholu knows everyone "Bholu, Bholu the good boy... - That?s enough" Will you give me a commission? - I will "All right, I?ll find a fake-husband for her then" So you?re thinking of leaving your house? Strange games God plays. Here I am... waiting to quit the dingy hole I?m living in and settling in a palace And you! You?re quitting a readymade palace If you had a father like mine... you?d have found my palace to be smaller than your dingy hole But what is the problem? - Ever since I?ve finished college... I?ve been begging for money to start a business "Whenever I talk about money, it?s as if I?ve stepped on his tail!" "This is the limit! - You have just one way, my friend" Change your father. - What? "Woo a rich girl, get married and become the heir to her father?s riches" You?re poking fun at me? - I?m not kidding "I?ve even scored with a girl. Teja, the garbage king?s daughter" "You?ve heard of him, haven?t you? It?s his only daughter. Madhuri" The garbage king?s daughter and you? Don?t forget your status Do you even have the money to buy her a box to collect the garbage? "I don?t, but Radhesham Tiwari"s son can buy even the garbage king..." not just a garbage can. - Tiwari? Owner of Anjali Industries? "Right. Anjali Foods, Anjali Chemicals, Anjali Pharmaceuticals..." and several other Anjali"s under my father?s belt You told her that you are Radhesham Tiwari"s son? "Yes. Don?t lose hope, my friend" "The more thick-skinned you are in money matters, the better it is for you" Harass your father so much with your demands... he?ll give you something some day or the other "Dad, one last time. Are you giving me the money or aren?t you?" You?ve been asking me for years and I didn?t give you anything Here you are. Start whatever business you want to with this 10 rupees! You?re poking fun at me? - Hear that? He thinks 10 rupees is too little! My grandfather ran the family with it My father arrived in this city with just 10 rupees And this is just what I got in my dowry "Ma, say something. Please. - What will I say, my son?" I asked him for a diamond necklace. He didn?t give that to me either He sold the land in the village yesterday. He got eight million "Let alone taking a look, I didn?t even get to smell the money" He?s put it all in the safe. - Shout! Yell as much as you want to There?s eight million lying in the house... "and you refuse to give me 750,000? - I spend a lot of money..." "in your education, boarding and maintenance" You aren?t getting a penny more "Who will give me the money, if not you, Papa?" What will I do? - Rob and steal But don?t ask me for the money. - I can?t take it anymore "If you don?t give me the money, I?m leaving this house" "Sure, go away. - I?m leaving!" I?ve made enquiries. Radhesham Tiwari"s bungalow in Pali Hill is lying vacant There?s no one there except a care-taker "When the garbage king gets to know, he?ll put you through a ringer!" I?ll marry Madhuri before he does that "Once the marriage has taken place, it?ll all be over" He?s the bride?s father. The only daughter What will he do? He?ll have to accept me as his son-in-law Are you out of your mind? "First tell me what?s to be done with my father, the villain" Did you ask him for the money? - Have I been talking in Hebrew? He?s sitting on his money like a snake. He won?t give me a penny! What did he have to say? - He asks me to rob and steal He?ll fight my case for free. - Nice idea So rob and steal. Best business. No capital required What does he do for a living? - With a tanpura around his neck... he goes around singing. - You mean he?s a beggar! "I?ll have to live with a beggar? - No beggar, a large-hearted man" Here he comes "Sorry, I?m late" You? - You! So you know each other? That?s good. There won?t be any problem then I?m not staying with this thug! You think I?ll willingly move in with a witch? "You call me a witch? - No, you are a witch?s mother..." "a grandmother, everything. You?re from a family of witches!" "Priya, let?s go. - Anjali..." don?t act like a child. My roommate is arriving tomorrow You must some how find a place! Adjust with him for now... "later, we?ll find another place. - Hey boss... listen to me" "In Bombay, you got to pay even to sleep on the pavements" "And that?s so dangerous. If someone drives over, you?re dead and gone" "Bholu, she agrees. - So does he" "According to Popat"s condition, the two of you must look like a married couple" So here?s the bridal necklace. That will cost another 50 rupees "Here, put it on her" Hey! I?m not letting any Tom Dick or Harry put the necklace on me Let me put it on you then She?s waiting for a prince to come along. Give it to her One minute. I?ll put it on her "Popat-Seth, save my life!" "What?s the matter, Waghmare? - I caught a thief with 50,000 rupees" "But I?m diabetic, you see. I went to take a leak..." and the thief escaped with the money. - How? I have decided. I?m not going to trust a thief ever again That?s right. - You know what Inspector Rane says? "He says I took 50,000 from the thief and I helped him escape!" Rane has gone an filed a First Information Report against me! Do you I think I?m that sort of a man? - This is the first time... "I?m hearing of something like this. - If I don?t keep 50,000..." "on Rane"s table, I?ll lose my job! - No, I?ll give you the money" But I?ll charge 10 per cent interest. - Why 10 per cent? I?ll return all the money to you. I swear! I?ll take all the money. But my interest will be 10 per cent 10 per cent? - Yes "And you?ll have to pawn something too. - Sure, I?ve brought it" The papers of my room and the stamp papers How often have I told you? Go inside! You see a stranger around and you come running! "Look, they?ve arrived" When did you get married? - Very recently "And you said... - It?s quite some time, really" "You don?t eat non-veg food, do you? - No" "You won?t leave each other and run away, will you?" "Are you in a cattle market, sir? Why worry about such detail?" "Let me make it clear. She?s the wife, he?s the husband" "Give them the keys, and the commission to me. You get that?" "You?ve brought the advance? - Sure, here it is" All right. You can stay here from today itself "Dulari, show them to their room" "Murder of an elderly couple for money. Servant arrested" See this? When I asked you to do all the chores and not employ servants... what did you say to me? That I?m a miser But look at what you get when you employ servants! You?ll sleep at home and wake up in hell! "Oh yes, nice heaven I?m living with you in" "Jeetu, my son! You?ve come back!" "The way you left, I thought you?d never look back at this house again" Well? You went broke and missed the free food? Have a couple of morsels if you wish. But you?re not getting a penny! "Daddy, I?m here to seek your blessings and sweeten your tongue" I?ve started a new business. - Really? What business? "Electronics, Mother. DVD players, CD players... it?s a big showroom" "It must?ve taken a lot of investment? - I invested 750,000..." and the bank financed me with the rest of the 6 million "750,000 rupees? Where did you get the money?" "You are the one who showed me the right path, daddy" What path did I show you? - You asked me to rob and steal So I did I got to know that there was a lot of money in a house I went there in the dead of the night. The husband and wife were fast asleep "I took the key from under the pillow, took the money from the safe..." and kept the keys back! - They must?ve called the cops by now! They don?t even know as yet. But now they?ll discover "But which house did you rob, son? - This one, Papa" it?s the money you got from selling the land? That?s the one I stole So you robbed your father! Snake in the grass! "When I asked him for it, he didn?t give it to me. He asked me to steal" Now how could a son disobey his father? It was unaccounted money anyway. Let the cops arrive I?ll tell them everything and the two of us will go to jail together Tell me the truth. Is he really my son? I?m convinced now! He?s truly your son! My darling son... my good boy aren?t you? "Return Papa"s money, my son! - That?s not possible" Are you sure? - Sure Get out of this house then! - That?s what I came for Lord! Protect my son! I?m told that this house is to be sublet. Is it true? Not true. - Who are you? You walk into my house and ask me who I am? "There was this chap, Pandu... who used to dust and swab the floor" Isn?t he there? - What work is it? It?s in his own interests. He?d have made an extra buck "But if he?s not here, I must leave" Sir! Sir! I?m Pandu! Can?t you believe me...? Here you are! So this is the real movie! That was only a trailer? "Pandu"s mysterious ways, sir. Come on in, sir... welcome" "This way, please..." As Lord Krishna says... how about a small drink? No. - I?ll have one Without any soda or water? - No Nothing at all? - No The boss has kept the liquor for guests But the guests will come only when the boss is here I didn?t want the booze to get spoilt. I kept taking small drinks... "and pouring in small amounts of water. And now, there?s just water in it!" "Pandu, you?re a very smart man. - Not at all, sir" "The moment I saw you, I knew I had met a thief in you" All I wanted to say to you was that I was as good as you are You mentioned something about money "You live here all alone, don?t you? - Yes..." the boss hasn?t even looked at this place for years "Despite being such a rich man, he lives like a villager" The lawyers and the managers carry the accounts to him in the village "To pay me a salary, he has maintained such a big house in the city!" If you could get some cream apart from this salary... what do you think about it? - Great idea "In that case, Radhesham Tiwari"s son is living here from tomorrow" Me Me! First class! "Sheru, is your information accurate?" "Absolutely certain, Garbage King... I mean, Teja-bhai" Who?s he? - It?s Radhesham Tiwari"s son Is it the Radhesham Tiwari of the multi-million Anjali Industries? "Yes. - He said, he?ll marry you?" "Tell me the truth. Else, I?ll kill you!" He?s been wanting to meet you I swear it on the scales! You?re really my little girl! I knew you?d find a gem even in the garbage! Hey! Get out! - This is my bed! Your bed? I pay half the rent of this house! Does the other half land from the skies? All right. Let?s draw lots with your name and mine "Whichever name the chit comes up with, gets the bed. Okay?" All right. Go ahead One moment. I?ll pick it. - All right. As you wish you Anjali! Now move... Go away What are you staring for? Go away Get up... what are you up to? - What? Can?t you sleep quietly? - When I lie on the floor... the cold gets to my bones and I start snoring. Like this it?s more like an explosion! I need quiet when I sleep! So go and sleep on the roof! I can?t sleep quietly on the floor "All right, go and rot in the bed" "I need peace, not a bed to sleep on! Go on!" Pandu... The garbage! Wash your eyes! - It?s the garbage king! Remember what I told you? You won?t get a penny if you mess up. Hurry up now! "Hello, sir, hello" Mr. Anil...? - He?s on the phone Don?t keep calling me for 15 or 20 million Take it from the drawer in my office What happened about the car? The Ferrari? No way it?s become very common nowadays. Sachin has one too "I want a Rolls Royce. Three, in fact" "One for me, one for my daddy..." and I want to donate one to my future father-in-law I?m Teja-bhai. - Who? The garbage... - Garbage! Sorry... there?s no garbage here. Go away. - I?m Madhuri"s father "Father-in-law! I?m sorry, I did not recognize you" "it?s okay, you?ll get to know me. My daughter has told me everything" What a gem my daughter has found! You?ll make a great couple! So when do we have the marriage? - As early as possible... But we?ll have to tell your parents. Won?t we? That?s the problem My parents want me to marry into a family of big industrialists They?ve even taken my birth chart. But I?ve told them in plain terms "If there?s anyone I?ll marry, it?s Madhuri!" That?s for sure. - So what are we to do? "Get married, at the earliest. That?s it. - And how about your daddy?" "Once we?re married, what will he be able to do about it?" "Even if he does, my boss still has 500 million to his name" Till the marriage they all act funny. They accept everything later "In your shoes, this is just what I?d have done, son" That?s why I?ve taken the risk. Of getting married So let?s have the engagement tomorrow. You can exchange rings We?ll find a nice day and have you married But don?t say a word to your Papa before all this happens "Come, let?s sweeten our tongues. - Yes, let?s go" Only after everything is over will they get to know the truth Mr. Sahay from the city is here. - All right Tell Ramdin to keep the calf away from the cow "It drinks up all the milk. - Very well, madam" Listen... - Lovely voice You never said that to me earlier "Not you, my dear woman... I?m talking about Ustad Aamir Khan." Will you shut him up now? There are guests waiting for you How can you say such things about a luminary like him? I?ve started businesses in your name all over the world... and you won?t use your brains at all? Do you have something in your brains? Or are you bankrupt already? Enough of your songs. Chandrakant and Renuka are waiting for you You ought to have told me! You just keep talking any nonsense "Anjali, you are simply taking the trouble" No trouble. You?re more a friend than an AIDS virus "Not AIDS virus, Anjali. She?s an advisor" Call her a legal advisor! - It?s the same thing Is it really? You can?t tell a bear from a potato! "In there, I was talking about Aamir Khan. You must know about him?" Aamir Khan? Who hasn?t heard of him? I?m a huge fan of his See? Now this is a well-informed man "As for her, the cattle, the fodder and the cow dung... that?s her world" "It isn?t her fault, actually. It?s your mistake" You didn?t expose her to the city at all How will she know about the world in the confines of the four walls? "That?s not the case, sister-in-law. - That?s how it is" Why did you send your son and daughter to London? I was born in the city and I will stay here till I die But it?s different with the children. They?ve got to keep up with the world... "move ahead in life, so... - I hope you don?t have to..." go through what happened Anandilal Kitpitia did "What happened? - Like you, Anandilal Kitpitia..." sent his sons to London. To study. The old couple lived in the village "The children went on to become very modern, hi-fi..." and the old couple were still raw villagers When the children returned from abroad... they couldn?t adjust themselves to the local conditions They were ashamed of their parents. Forget living together... they weren?t even willing to call them Mummy and Daddy And one day the children screamed You bloody Indians and went away The children never looked at their parents again They kept yearning till they died. - God! "If my children treat me like that, it?s going to kill me!" I?ve told him so often to move to the city... "to learn the way of life there. Let?s go to the city, please" "Even if it?s only for a month. - All right, don?t be stubborn" Anandilal Katpitia... - I?ll think about it Give me the papers. - Here are all the reports I?ll bring the case papers of Anjali Chemicals next week We must leave now. - Very well Do call me if you meet Aamir Khan. I want a photograph taken with him But he?s dead. - How?s that possible? "I saw "Lagaan" only recently. - "Lagaan"?" I?ve been... it?s Ustad Aamir... have you ever heard him? Let?s go. We might miss the bus! You are all alike! Lagaan! What Lagaan? Saved! The ceremony is over! - What are you saying? "I say, it?s nice" Ten days later is an auspicious date. We?ll have the wedding on that day I?m the one who?s eating this paratha. So you needn?t laugh I don?t need your permission to laugh! - Those who laugh belong in a loony bin! And broken parathas belong in the garbage bin! My parathas are neither burnt nor broken. I?ll eat all I want Is someone there? "The man and wife have left the lights and fans on, to have a honeymoon!" How are you...? Is everything all right? Any problem? What aroma is that? What?s cooking? Potato-pancakes? Yes "When we were just married, Dulari made some for me too" Her mother died the moment she ate one "Ever since, potato-pancakes have been a no-no in my house" My wife makes nice ones. Will you have some? "Would you like one? - No, you?ll be left hungry" "Oh no, have some! - I hope your wife doesn?t mind?" "Do you mind, lady? - Oh no, not at all" See? Bring it up. Quick! "Hurry up, darling! We?re hungry" What?s one going to do...? One moment. There?s more "Not burnt, not broken..." steaming hot pancakes! Here you are! For you and your wife. - Some chutney...? "Sure, there is" Take it all away. We?ll take the bowl later Yogurt...? - We don?t have any "Even if it?s in pieces and burnt, I can eat to my heart?s content" I?ll fix you! Here you are! And I went mad looking for you! "In the bank, in the bar... - You?ll have your money" Let the marriage take place first. - No marriage! Only destruction! - Are you already drunk in the day? "I?ve only drunk, but when he arrives tomorrow, I?ll be buried!" What rubbish! Who?s arriving? - Your father Radhesham Tiwari He?s arriving with his wife! - What am I going to do? "Go underground. Quit the city. If possible, quit the world!" "Right now, go away from here! - What are you telling me?" "That old man can?t do without cows, buffaloes, fodder and the works" "He?ll stay in the city for a week, at the most" So disappear for a week! - That?s an expensive proposition "Living in style, I?m already deep in debt" Pawn the ring garbage gave you and check into a cheap lodge it?s only for a week! Isn?t that right? Of course it?s right! What? You?re going away to London? For a week? What?s the hurry? "For business? To make money? Of course, you must go ahead" Take care of yourself in the aircraft "Don?t thrust your arm outside the window. Yes, I?ll tell Madhuri..." go ahead and make money. Bye Master is here! - So this is our Pandu? "How have you been, Pandu? - Your blessings, sir" "Greetings. - Welcome, sir" "What?s happening here? - This is our manager, Mr. KC Shukla" "This is your first visit to our city, so this is a small welcome" "You must be tired, sir. We?ll leave now" What for? I want to get to know all of you "Please come in, all of you" "Where are you going, Pandu? Go and fetch the luggage" For a week or two... how much luggage must he be carrying? Who told you? - So? Sir?s going to live here now. Forever What happened? Fetch the luggage "God, nice way you?ve found of snatching my livelihood" The things he did so he could sleep on the bed! He now sits quietly! But at least I can sleep in peace Not a drop of water here "Let me tell you what I must today..." let your heart remain with me "Let me tell you what I must today..." let my heart remain with me "My eyes are glued to your face..." "to your face, I?ve lost my heart" You are the one... who lives in my heart Pining torments me... I feel scared "Your sweet words might yet cast a spell on me" "Let me bear the sweet pain of love..." let your heart remain with me "Let me tell you what I must today..." let my heart remain with you Let my heart remain with you Lay off! I?m being forced to live with you! I know you?re not a decent man... but I thought you had some manners. You have proved me wrong! Don?t even talk to me again! Don?t ever talk to me! Stop it! Is that the beat? Or are you killing flies? Don?t do something you can?t! - So why are you doing it? Shut up! - I was following you with the beat Don?t follow me. Accompany me with the beat "Get it? If tune is the mother, the rhythm is the father" One who doesn?t get it is good for nothing The bell. - The door?s over there Want me to send you packing? - I forgot! Whom do you wish to see? The mistress! "Who are you, sister? - It?s me!" "Who are you, sister? - Radhesham Tiwari"s..." "Shut up! Who are you, sister? - I?m Mrs. Anjali Tiwari" I?m glad your name hasn?t changed I?ve made Anjali a member of the Wild Forest "The forest? - No, it?s a club. A social club" "Now that we?re here, we must learn the ways of this city" The women in this city aren?t lizards on the walls They do a lot of social work. - What?s surprising is that... everyone there knew Anjali beforehand. - Is it? "The moment we stepped in, everyone shook hands and said..." That?s when I realized what a huge business empire we?re running What?s more? He too recognized me and shook hands with me! Who was the unfortunate man? Shah Rukh. - Hungry who? Shah Rukh. The Khan. Film-star All the film stars come there. - We must live in style now No style for me. - Bring a bat into the house... it?ll still hang from a tree when it goes to sleep! "Pandu, you get no salary next month. - It?s a saying, sir!" "The saying is, bathe as much as the crow wishes to, it can?t become a swan!" That?s true! - I?ll bathe and get ready We?ve got to go to the dance class. - Dance class? At this age? You?ll sprain your waist! Let it be it?s an English dance. Like this! A new way of sweeping the floor? - See? He starts a fight whenever I want to do something nice That?s the only difference between marriage and war "In a marriage, you get to sleep with the enemy" Anjali darling... mercy! What?s happening here? - The English dance "If you jump around at this age and something happens, I?ll have to pay up" "Nothing?s happening to me. - I?m talking about the tiles, not you" Quiet! High society women dance every day... "to keep their bodies fit. I suggest, you dance too" Me? - Yes. Don?t we live in Mumbai? We must learn to live in style. Look at your managers and officers They live in such style. You are their employer... and yet you go around half naked! Don?t you feel ashamed? I wear what clothes are necessary to cover my body And look at your body! It?s sagging "Take a walk every morning. Buy a dog, to throw your weight around" You can take a walk with me then. - You just won?t take me seriously I?ve wasted a lot of years in the village with cattle and fodder I can?t take all that now. Just watch what Anjali does now I can see it all! Your obsession with western culture has begun... I wonder where it will end! "Radhesham Tiwari"s from your village, isn?t he?" Who? - The owner of Anjali Industries? "Oh yes, he?s from my village. - I?m told he?s in the city nowadays" Go and meet him. Since you and he are from the same village... "out of sentiment, he might give you a job" Really? - Give it a try You and his company share the same name Maybe that will make him happy and he?ll give you a job The third time he has stopped singing! This thing has stalled for the third time! The old one was good enough. But you still bought a new system You?ve changed too. So why not the CD-player? "If you find a new woman, will you throw me out?" "I?ll do that, if the need arises. - Just you try" I?ll show you. I?m the mother of two children And people still say I look like your daughter Be thankful they don?t think I?m your grandfather Stop joking and bring a new woman! It?ll become like your CD player! It?ll break down! - What?s the number of this store? Radhe-Shyam. - Praise the Lord This is Radhesham Tiwari speaking You?ve sold me a qawwali in the name of a Thumri? "In just a day, it?s broken down. Colds, dysentery..." "You must see a doctor, sir. This is the Videocon Gallery" I?m talking about the CD-player... the nuisance you sent to me No sorry. Pick up this trash and get going immediately And send me a new one immediately "No, no, sir. I?ll come and personally check it" Who you? - Anjali... "Anjali, yes... what work do you have?" I wish to meet Mr. Radhesham. - Well? What?s the good news? For a job. - We have a flourishing business He doesn?t need a job. - No... I?m the one who wants a job. Take a look at my certificates All right. The master?s very busy right now. Come later Please... - I told you! Go! I think I must wait a while "If I get to meet Mr. Radhesham, my work will be done" Must be his daughter Know where the CD-player is? I?m here to repair it "But I?m not a mechanic. I own a store, I?ve got to check it" Must be in there What airs! Spoilt brat! "Hey, roving eyes... over here. - Jeetendra from Videocon" Over there The body?s lying here. Take it away in a bier Take it away. - I?ll take a look. Two minutes "No need to take a look. I told you, it?s dead" "Two minutes, I?ll check. - No need to check. Don?t touch that" "It must be minor problem, sir. Let me at least check it!" Pick up the box and get going. At once! "Not to worry, sir. I?ll send a salesman and have it replaced" "No, I want my money back!" I don?t want any replacement. I want my money back! He has left? One can?t trust these city-guys at all! Greetings. - Greetings. You...? I wanted to meet you. But madam told me that you?re very busy She?s a liar. I?m always free. What is it? I?ve come here looking for a job. Here are my certificates Wow! You?ve done M.A. And B.A. Classical music too! Wow! "Haven?t you done your SSC? - Of course, I have" I was only kidding What sort of a job are you looking for? - Anything will do All we need is a security guard "And there?s no need for an M.A. Or a B.A. For that, is there?" Let?s clap "Girl, you haven?t left? - I..." You keep out of this! - Sir... He will talk any nonsense. You get going "Go away, I say! - What are you doing?" Is that the way you talk to guests? "Have you forgotten your manners? - I know my manners, mind you" The poor girl... - Poor girl? "So give her half your wealth! - Sure, I will!" I won?t ask you! - I know what?s on your mind! But I?m the Pandey family too. I brought three cars full of gold Return it to me with interest and do what you want to! "In any case, I fed your guests and took the vows to become your wife!" God! This wife sure is a curse! She drove the poor girl away Why did you take the trouble? I told Mr. Radhesham to phone me... I?d have the CD-player changed. - But I?ve come here for a job "You issued an ad, didn?t you? - Sorry... I don?t understand" I want this job The job? What are you talking about? I need it very badly Where?s the need for Radhesham Tiwari"s daughter to take up a job? Looks like there is a misunderstanding... "I get it. I am an individual, I have an identity of my own". Right?" That?s a nice thing. I?ve seen girls with that attitude of late "Even if their father is a millionaire, to prove your worth..." "you?ll work at pizza joints, cafes and other places" "I?ll give you the job, if you wish. But what will I be able to pay you?" What?s 5000 rupees for you? - 5000? I know it?s little. But this business... Oh my God! I haven?t even offered you a seat "Come to my office, please" "If you speak the truth, you?ll blow this last opportunity you?ve got" I agree to work at 5000 rupees Your name...? - Anjali Anjali! So daddy has named his business after his daughter Jeetu. Call me Jeetu. - But... "We?re going to be friends, okay?" "Stop playing with water and get on with the work, Pandu" "Look, our new puppy. - Wow!" "Where are you going with the hippo? - No hippo, it?s my doggie" And I?m asking the dog where it?s going with the hippo? "Shut up! Because I?m your wife, you can?t talk any nonsense!" You?re always acting proud like a peacock "But don?t forget. When the peacock loses its feathers, it?s naked!" "Let?s go, puppy. - You can laugh all you want to" The things that happen in this house! You? Here? - Hasn?t Anil returned? The lodge... he?ll return after a week from London You can come after a week. - Let me meet Mr. Tiwari then We?re going to be relatives soon. And we have to meet some day He?s not in right now. - Where has he gone? To the market. - He? To the market? The temple! To offer namaz! - Namaz at the temple? No... to chant the Lord?s name. - All right. I?ll wait here "That?s no good. After the prayer, he?ll take a bath" Won?t be come home for a bath? - Yes... no! "He?ll bathe at the temple. He has sworn it, you see" "There?s a well at the temple. - He won?t drown in it, will he?" "He will come home, right? - Yes, tomorrow!" I?ll come tomorrow then. - Sure? Why are you crying? - Tears of happiness There?s going to be love between the two of you I?ll come tomorrow Didn?t this garbage bin find another time to spring here? "Pandu, you?d rather vamoose. Or you?re going to be dead" Dead! - God Someone from my village was here to inform me "Master, can you give me 5000 rupees? I?ll work and repay it" Of course. I?ll give you the money Take a train and go to the village immediately Or you?ll land in trouble Trouble will break out even after I?ve left for the village "Lord Ganesh, don?t think I?m flattering You, but You can very well do it" That girl Anjali... make her fall for me "She?s Tiwari"s only daughter. If she falls for me, it?ll be a huge lottery" An order from Hotel New Horizon. They want 50 sets of Videocon TV it?s 6 p.m. Let me drop you home No... I?ll take a bus I?ve got a car. Why must you take a bus? C?mon... don?t think too much What happened? - Nothing "How can I go away, until you go inside?" Why not? - I can see you then "A coke, please" "Some chips, please" "Mister, watch the movie ahead. Not here" I?m not an enemy... why have you driven me crazy? I?m a friend... "so why?ve you stolen my heart?" "I was out one day, straying from the path..." "when colorful roses of love blossomed" "All distances were finished. We began to get closer" "Such was our state, we began to breathe faster" "I?m not among your assassins..." "so why?ve you thrust me among those that live?" I?m a friend... "so why?ve you stolen my heart?" "I?ve lost my heart, although it all began as a joke" "I?ve forgotten the world to lose myself in your love" "I wonder how I will tell you about my love..." "how will I profess my love to you?" I live in your heart... "so why have you given my heart a sweet pain?" "I?m the beautiful moonlight everyone covets..." "God alone knows who I was born for" "My desire is a writing on the wall" "So there will be victory and defeat in this game of love" I rock in your arms... "yet, why do you accuse me?" I?m not an enemy... I?m a friend... "so why?ve you driven me crazy?" "Why?ve you stolen my heart?" Can?t you sit without clinging to the girl? Can?t you sit without clinging to her? Is she your sister? - She?s my wife! So what are you going to do? What? "What wife, son? Your beard says it all. You weren?t married ever" You baldie! Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you to ask me? - Forget me. Who are you? Who are you? "Whoever you guys are, I?ve bought a ticket to sleep in peace" Not to watch the movie! Go outside and fight! Where will I get a rampuri? - I don?t know "Bhelpuri, paani-puri, you get there. - I?m talking about a knife!" "Where will I get one? - Don?t do anything rash, boss" "I?ve decided. If I see him with Anjali again, I?m going to kill him" "Either he lives, or I... - Master, master... he?s her boss" She has only respect for him. She?s not in love with him How do you know? - I see them everyday in a restaurant Which restaurant? He escaped "But if he looks at you again, he?s going to walk on his hands" He doesn?t know what stuff I?m made of "Forget it. There you go again. - No, Anjali" I can?t tolerate anyone teasing you. I?ll kill him! Now look... Jeetu... "Why? What happened? - Let?s go, please" What is it? - What is it? What?s biting you? - What?s biting you? "What?s biting you, tell me? - You tell me what?s biting you" How did you get here? - Walking. What?s it to you? Walking? You?ll run away now! Why?ve you standing between us? "Why? You own the place? - Yes, this is my father?s pad. So?" "It?s my grandfather?s pad, so? - You got the nerve, eh?" "You got it? Want me to show? - All right, you show it" Try and touch me. - You try and touch me Don?t use my lines! - You don?t use my lines Go away... - Want me to show you? I?ll show it to you. - Go on... get lost Want me to show you? - Let me see! Coward! You don?t have the spine! Paper-tigers. They won?t even touch each other You don?t know me. - Who are you? I?ve seen so many like you! Go away! Come here and talk to me! Pipsqueak Here I am! What do you want to say? - What is it...? What? I?m not scared of you! I?m going to catch them today! God Almighty! Why?ve you crying? Why?ve you hollering away? What?s wrong? You ask me what?s happened? What a thick-skinned man! Disgusting! "Despite what you did, you proudly stand before me!" Aren?t you ashamed? - Am I a virgin bride... to feel shy without reason? Tell me clearly what has happened So you want to hear it from my mouth? Is someone else around? - Not the values I?ve imbibed... to utter disgusting things! I?m from the Pandey family Keep crying! What were you doing with that girl in the shrubs? Girl? What girl? I was looking for my cane. Without your dhoti? You look so innocent! Butter wouldn?t melt in your mouth! "Tell me, who is that girl? I don?t wear glasses like you!" Tell me. For how long has this game of hide n seek been going on? You drive the girl away the moment you see me! How can you even think of something so filthy? You can very well do it! And I can?t even think of it! I have done nothing! Even if I have... it?s a great thing I?ve done! - You haven?t bought me... to expect me to watch the fun! - So go away! Right now! "All right, I?ll go away. But first return to me..." "the 3 cars full of gold I brought in dowry, along with interest" I?ll go away after that... Till then... I won?t let you have a ball! - Shut up! "What?s up, master? Did the girl say something nasty to you?" "One thing is clear, Bholu. She?s in love with her boss" Not someone crazy like me I?m glad my craziness has been of help How else could I have made the world see reason? You?re getting disheartened for no rhyme or reason "She?s in love with you, but she won?t tell you" She wants to make you feel jealous. - What sort of love is that? "This game of love, you know" About swimming across oceans of fire and all that crap Take my advise. Fall in love with another girl Want me to knock your teeth out? - Don?t jump the gun Pretend to love someone else. Like you?re burning in envy... "she too will burn, if she really loves you" She?ll come running to you. Take it from me in writing I?ve had it! "Jeetu, my mother?s here" "If she sees me here, all hell will break loose" I said I was going to a computer class. - Why? Because I haven?t told my parents I?ve taken up a job here "If she sees me... - I get it, I get it" "Stay here, I?ll handle her" Hello... welcome! Wow! You look beautiful! New sari! New pair of shoes! What can I do for you? - Give me some music cassettes "Music I can dance to. - Sure, what do you want?" "No, I want only Western music! A childhood habit, you see" Know what? I?ll make a nice collection and send it to your house I hope you know my address? - Who doesn?t? Remember to send it across. Please don?t forget Has she left? - Has she? Phew! Saved! "Jeetu, I got to leave early today. - Why?" Tomorrow?s my birthday Aren?t you inviting your boss to the party? "No, there?s no party. Actually, I?ve got to out shopping" "Let?s go. I?ll accompany you. - No, I?m expecting a friend" You don?t want to invite me to your birthday party... but I?m going to give you a surprise surely "Priya, Priya, Priya..." My dear! "I went crazy about you, the moment I saw you" "I know, there are obstacles in our path" "But rivers and streams do flow down the mountains" "Like we have to unite some day" "You mean the life to me. I love you more than my life" You are dearest to my heart "If she?s jealous, she?s in! If she?s in, I?ve scored!" "Did you write this? - Yes, but..." Devil! You? - I?m here to wish the birthday girl Fat roses! Who told you today?s the birthday? You are a very special customer. And we maintain records But there?s a mistake in your records. - Really? The birthday?s tomorrow. Not today But I was told it?s today. - Who told you? "That?s what I heard. - All right, all right" "Do come again tomorrow, like you?ve come today" "You must. The first flowers have been given by you, you see?" That?s all right He has brought roses? And a letter? "My dear Anjali. These roses are a token of my love" "Roses arrive today, to be followed by the bee" I?m the one he?s going to sting first How was it? - What? "My bouquet, of course. - Bouquet?" I gave it in your mummy?s hands. Didn?t she give it to you? "I see, that one? It was very nice" Did you read the note I left in the bouquet? "The note...? Yes, I did" What did it say? - Well... "don?t you know? - No, I mean..." "did you like it? - Yes, of course. Very much" "So you don?t mind any word I?ve written, do you?" Mind? Why would I mind? So why did you lie to me? - Lie? "That yesterday was your birthday? - Actually, Jeetu..." You didn?t want to invite me to the party That?s not true. There was no party at all "I know, because the party?s tomorrow and so is your birthday" Your mummy has invited me "So you?re coming tomorrow? - I won?t, if you don?t want me to" You must! Why mustn?t you? At what time did she say? "At 7, she said. - I see" Know what? Come at 9. - Why? The time has changed a bit I?ll be there at 9. - All right "If Jeetu had arrived before the cake was cut, I?d have been exposed" Why?ve you standing outside? - Actually... I?m waiting for some friends of mine. They don?t have the proper address Know what? Go in there and enjoy the party I?ll join you as soon as my friends arrive Of course! I?ll join you in a few minutes He?s the same boy! Dad! I?ve had it! He?s hiding from me! So I was right "This boy?s having an affair with Anjali, I?m sure" You?ve got your peace... "all I?ve got is my craziness" You?ve come to your senses... and I?m still in a daze "But you?re the one my heart still loves" You?ve got your peace... "all I?ve got is my craziness" You?ve come to your senses... and I?m still in a daze "But you?re the one my heart still loves" How am I going to placate it? "My heart is crazy, it won?t relent" How will I tell my heart...? "It does not know what love is all about" "I?m obsessed with you... and you don?t even realize it" "You got all the hospitality, I was treated with indifference" "You?ve got back to your senses, I?m still in a daze" "You?re the one my heart loves" "Here?s someone who could die for her love..." "and there?s someone who?s unfaithful in love" "What pain these distances give... only in separation will we know" "Ever since I have seen you, I?ve gone crazy" You?ve got your sleep... I got only helplessness You?ve come to your senses... and I?m still in a daze "But you?re the one my heart still loves" You?ve got your peace... "all I?ve got is my craziness" You?ve come to your senses... and I?m still in a daze You dare call that boy to the party? You invited that witch too. - Which one? The one your eyes were glued to at the party! Wow! That?s a wolf in sheep?s clothing! I can understand it from the way your feet were moving and... the way your anklets were chiming. Now that you?re exposed... you accuse me and find the excuse of having fun with that young boy? The pot calling the kettle black! "I caught you in the shrubs, so you cast mud at me..." and try to save yourself? Listen carefully! I?m not letting your scheme work! I?ve had enough of your farce! You take me for a fool? You think I?m an idiot? Just let me tell you! I know how it is! It?s not going to work for long! - All right Give me the gold I brought with interest. I?ll go back! Go back! How about the expensive saris I?ve given your horrible body? Who?s paying for the goodies you helped yourself to over the years? I cooked for you all day and night! My work pays for it all! You paint the town red with strangers and talk back at me! "The scores are leveled! If you can do it, so can I!" "Will you do it...? Will you? - Yes, I will too!" So will I! - Go ahead and do it! Who?s stopping you? Just stop interfering in my affairs! You mustn?t interfere either! - I won?t! Hello. - Hello I?m Teja-bhai. - Please come in I haven?t recognized you. - I?m your son?s father-in-law I don?t get it. - I won?t beat around the bush... and confuse you. I?ll come the point Don?t let your B.P. Get out of hand when you listen to it That?s what I say. Come straight to the point My daughter has decided to marry your son What? Hello One moment. Your daughter has decided to marry my son Right? - Right So what can I do? Tell your daughter to change her mind "No, you don?t understand" The two of them have got together and taken this decision They?ve got engaged. They?ve even exchanged rings What is he talking about? - It can?t be our son Because our son is not here. - I know Your son is in London. - Right But your son was here. - When did he go back? "After the engagement, he went away. On business" I?ve sent my son to London for further studies. Not business "Now look, mister. What?s happened is in the past" Let?s peacefully and amicably sort it out "It can?t be sorted out, Teja-bhai. My son will marry the girl I want him to" "You mean, whatever has happened... - What has happened?" "They?ve just exchanged rings, right? They haven?t got married yet" He?ll throw the ring away. End of the story How will he take off the ring? My daughter isn?t an empty bottle whose label he can change at will Don?t talk too much! From the look of you... I can tell how your daughter must be. - Does she also sport a moustache? "Radhesham Tiwari! If you?re a big man, I don?t care!" You don?t know Teja! I come from a family of killers There wasn?t a day when my father?s knife did not taste blood! His father was a butcher? - You are insulting me! "You?re still here? Shameless man, go away" I?ll go away! But I will surely come back! Listen... - What? "I?m talking to her, not you" "I suggest we call our son down here. - Yes, call him here" And see whether he obeys to you or me. - Won?t you go away? I?m leaving. Don?t yell as if you?re fighting the elections! Could there be some truth in the rubbish he just spoke? Not at all. He?s just a fool Do you really think so? - No Know what? We?ll telephone him and call him over I?ve got to know the truth. - What? That Anjali and you are not man and wife Meaning? - I?ve heard the bickering... that goes on between the two of you. How would you know how happy I am... to learn the truth? - We do keep fighting... but we are really man and wife. - I know everything. Look at this "Miss Anjali Does anyone address a married woman as "Miss"?" "Ever since you wrote that letter to me, I understood..." you would really marry me. You will free me from Popat"s cage! Marry you? What if Popat gets to know? - To hell with the old fossil! Anjali"s coming You?re the one I was waiting for. There?s a letter for you "I thought I?d give it to you. - Okay, I get it" So this is the extent he has gone to! But why must I care? Mother has written to me from the village The landlord?s son will arrive. He?ll marry me and take me away We?ll live in marital bliss "My dear Anjali, I?m sending Raja to you by tomorrow?s train" "You?ll get to know each other better, if he stays with you for a few days" "He?s the one you?re going to marry anyway" "Don?t forget, we?re alive today because his family has helped us" "You will never disobey your mother. You will agree to the wedding" "I?m sending you a photograph of Raja. He?s no longer like he was..." "he has changed a lot. He has shaved his beard, he now looks like a prince" You?ll be stunned "My prince will come to marry me and I?ll dance in joy" Another villain...? Who the hell is he? - Whoever He?ll marry Anjali and even drive me out of the house I have an idea. - What? Let?s scare him and force him to return How? He?s the one. - So go and scare him! "No, not here. It?s a crowded place" "Once I scare him, he won?t step in Mumbai again. Come on" What?s he up to...? Has he gone mad? "He?s cleaning something. The shoe or the pole, I can?t say" He?s stuck to it! - He must be electrocuted! Go and save him! - Are you crazy? You?ll die too "Find a stick. One blow, and he?ll be separated" Is that why they tried to kill me? "Yes. I brought you here, because I liked you" Anjali isn?t as innocent as you think She?s having a terrific scene with someone Who? - The one who... He?s a very dangerous man. Have you heard of Chhota Chetan? I saw the movie. In 3-D. - Not that He?s from the underworld. Even the cops are terrified of him "He has committed 40 murders, but he still hasn?t been caught" He uses a new knife for every killing. I saw him with a new one yesterday Maybe it?s meant for you. - So why did Anjali"s Ma send me here? They plan to bring you to the city to bump you off Even if Anjali marries Chhota Chetan after your death... "her family has nothing to lose. - No, that can?t be true" "Whether you believe it or not, your body will believe me" Is Raja here? - Go to sleep Raja! Is there anyone here answering to the name Raja? I?m going to finish him! He?s hiding somewhere around My men have just broken a few of his limbs He?s my 50th victim. I?m having a grand party after killing him I?ll finish him if he comes here. Tell him I was here Did you see...? - How would I? You covered my face! "Why did you lie? You say he has committed 40 murders, he says 50!" "Whatever! He has committed the murders, not me" Now get the hell out of here. - How far is the railway station? I?ve got catch a train back home. - No point in venturing out There?s a strike in the railways. Can?t say when it?ll end So what am I to do? - Hide somewhere here Chhota Chetan and his men will look for you all over Mumbai So hide under an assumed name. - But where will I hide? Find a cheap lodge near the railway station. Hole up in one of them Catch the first train out as soon as the strike is over "Else, I?ll have to mail your body to your village" "Believe me, or go to hell" "Welcome! Welcome, Teja-bhai" Hey sonny... come here. Let me show you something This is my son. - This...? Recognize him? - No No? And he says he?s your father-in-law! Ask him! Have I married your daughter? - No Have I promised to marry her? - No Tell me something... are you weak in the head? No. - So why did you kick up a fuss... that he had promised to marry her? Why did you create a scene? Is he your son? Any doubts? - No I have no doubt that he?s my son He?s not the one I spoke about. It?s your other son What?s all that about...? Which other son? Your elder son! - Look at him I have another son and I don?t even know about it! You have a brother too! - You are a big man... who runs a big business empire. You must have forgotten But your other son lives right here. Everyone knows that My God! What am I hearing...? You have another son outside my knowledge? "This man is lying! - He?s your son, all right" Though he?s a bit dark of skin "When I saw her, I was a bit doubtful" But anyone who looks at you will say he?s your son "The same eyes, the same nose, The same lips..." This is rubbish! Don?t scream! "Call your servant, Pandu. He knows everything" He was witness to everything. Where is Pandu? "He?s gone to the village, his father has died" "Died, or did you have him killed?" You send him away when you?re about to be exposed? I understand it all! It?s your ploy to stall the marriage! Enough! Make anymore noise and I?ll sue you for defamation! "Shut up! You aren?t Tiwari, you?re a disease!" I?ve cured diseases like you! I visit the courts every day "Don?t forget, I come from a family of killers" "Are you threatening me? Are you? - Yes, I?m threatening you!" So go and do what you can! - You?ll know it very soon! "In a week?s time, if you don?t let the marriage take place..." you?ll know! My God! I?m doomed! Mom! What are you doing? Am I supposed to stay here or go back to London? "My son, at what time is your flight? - At eleven tonight, Mom" Go away! If you stay here... you?re going to get spoilt in your father?s shadow! "Dad, I?m leaving. I?ll confirm my ticket at the airport" All right. God bless you Let?s get out of here. There?s no meaning in staying here Let?s pack our bags and get going! - Only after coming here... I?ve got to see your true colors! - What rubbish are you talking? You don?t believe me and you believe a stranger? I wouldn?t have believed it earlier But there?s no way I cannot believe it now "You are a flirt! Before our marriage, you have been a womanizer!" I?ll go back only when I have all the proof! I?ll shave my moustache if you leave this city! Your heart won?t relent unless you see him! "That bloody Videocon! - My virtuous husband, aren?t you?" You keep listening to classical music all day... and this is what you do by night? You are Satan himself! Wow! You accuse me...? I?ve seen your programmes already! "A good thing, isn?t it? Keep watching it... and kill me!" God! She won?t die like that... go to her help! "Manager, do you have a room?" "Whatever it is, I shouldn?t have to leave the room" And I want an attached toilet Name...? Raja... Tulsidas Khan "What name is Tulsidas Khan? - Shut up, scoundrel" Your father?s name? - Javed Chaurasia Your mother?s name? - Mumtaz Bedi Are you the India-Pakistan border...? Were you born to cross parents? "Shut up, or I?ll slap you! - Is your old man dead?" "Of course, I?ll pay you" "And give me the keys, quick. I badly want to pee" And don?t tell anyone that I?m staying here Pay for the cups you broke. - Get lost Pay for the two cups you broke. - I won?t! Get lost! Give that to me My umbrella! I?ll carry it for you. - Not necessary The name is Babu Bisleri. - I don?t want to bathe! "I can?t trust anyone. Everyone appears to be Chhota Chetan"s man" "They?re out to kill me! Anjali, why did you do this to me?" Why? "Priya, what am I going to do about Jeetu" "If I tell him the truth, I?ll lose my job" There?s a vacancy in my office for a receptionist Your qualifications are the best among the lot. I?m sure you?ll get it But you?ll have to wait for a month. - A month? What will I do with Jeetu in a month? Don?t go to work at all. - What if he visits Radhesham"s house? "He?ll get to know the truth. Which he has to, some day" Ring him up and ask him for leave of a month Tell him that your Papa"s suspicious That he sends the driver with you everywhere "When you finally land the job, you can tell him the truth" "Sir, I?ve checked it thoroughly. It?s first-class" Since you sent me the new system did I ever call you to tell you... that I wanted you to come here and solve a problem? "No, sir. You didn?t. - No?" So did you dream it had a problem? "No? So why have you come here? - Service check, to see if it?s okay" I know there?s no problem with it. - No problem What are you looking around for? "Sir, isn?t Anjali there?" So this is how it is! He calls a woman of his mother?s age by her name! "You do get along well, don?t you? - We know each other very well, sir" "You must?ve met at your shop, right? - No, sir..." we?ve met mostly outside. - Romeo and Juliet meeting outside! No wonder she goes out all dressed up! Anjali"s not in Have you checked everything? - Yes Is all the payment made? - Yes Nothing outstanding? - Not at all So what are you looking around for? - That painting... "it?s lovely. Must be very expensive? - I don?t know, I stole it" There?s the door Can I have a glass of water? - No water supply for three days I?ve been drinking only coffee. But there?s just a cup left. Anything else? I?ll come in a couple of days to check whether there?s a problem "No, you have given us enough trouble. Don?t give us anymore trouble..." we?ll bear the trouble we already have "If I could meet her mother, maybe I could meet Anjali too" "Is the wife there, sir?" "My wife! Not "the wife!" It?s not a joint-account! She?s all mine What I meant was... - I know what you meant She?s not in right now. Tell me what it is regarding "Will you tell her I was here, asking for her?" Must I? - Please don?t forget Oh no! I can?t forget this till I die! Sister! She?s regaining consciousness. Please call her husband There?s no need to worry. You got injuries in the feet and head... because of which you?ve been unconscious all day But the doctor has examined you. Everything is all right How will I thank you? - Why thank me? I just got here Thank your husband who?s been here all night and day "He didn?t budge from here. He cried so much, he?s in a bad way" "You?ll be discharged in a day or two. Look after yourself, okay?" I must leave now it?s all my mistake. Please forgive me Who?s that boy who has tainted a virtuous woman like your wife? You! You fed her all the crap and compelled her to come to the city! I didn?t want to set foot in this city! I know the water in this city is contaminated... and the people here are scoundrels! - Sir... Anandilal Kitpitia... - I?m sick of you and your... coming! Stop ringing! This is Jeetu from Videocon. Is Anjali there? Anjali has drowned in the sea! - Please give her the phone... Are you trying to bully me? You wretched guitar! I?m not giving the phone to Anjali! I?m not! What will you do? Bull?s offspring! Whom are you threatening? I know scum like you! Your father must?ve been up to no good to sire you If you even utter the name of the Tiwari family... I?m going to break the legs of everyone in your family! He appears to be a dangerous man Well... Looks like only a beating will... - What beating at this age? It was different earlier. I used to fell a couple of them in the ring "I?m talking about thugs, sir. Not you" I?ve fought a lot of such criminal cases! I know a few thugs too You?ve only got to pay them and show them what this chap looks like Don?t hit him too much. Just give him a push and let him go "If he acts smart, I?m going to break his legs and..." "No, please, no! - One leg then?" No! He won?t look appealing without his hands and feet Just give him a light slap There he is... I?ll be hiding behind the tree Let?s go What?s your problem? You dare toy with the womenfolk of the Tiwari family? Beat him up! Where are you going...? Who?s going to pick him up? Hey mister... get up. Your friends have left You can?t use this telephone. It?s meant for the staff Everyone wants to use it "Anjali, where have you been? I want to meet you right now!" "No, I can?t meet you right now. I?m out shopping with my parents" I?m calling you on the sly How long are we going to play hide and seek? You?ve called me after five days! You know how worried I?ve been? "Hadn?t you phoned today, I was about to go to your house" "No, don?t do that. If my Papa gets to know..." He?s got to know already! He sent goons to beat me up! But what?s God going to do? I?ll have to do something on my own Won?t I call you at your house if I want to talk something official? Which I did. But the old man flared up and called me names There was another bastard there who was very rude "God! Jeetu, don?t call my place ever again" I?ll give you a friend?s number. Her name is Priya The number is 6334523. Call only in an emergency "There is an emergency! Now, this moment!" "I want to ask you something, Anjali. It has to do with my life and death" "What? - Do you love me, or don?t you?" Say something. I?m sure you love me... "but I want to hear you say it. Say yes, just once..." and I?m willing to take on the whole world for you "Jeetu, how will I say it?" "Just once, say I love you" "If you say no, I will never call again" Why don?t you say something? Is the old man around...? - Yes "If you agree, you don?t need to say anything" "Just cut the line. - Know the truth, Jeetu?" How often will I tell you not to use this phone? Why did you get up from your bed? Go and lie down There?s this beautiful fairy... "she has descended from the skies..." she stands before me... "she?s the one I have fallen in love with" I have fallen in love with her "She?s the light from the Moon and the stars..." she?s the lamp in a temple "One glimpse of her has driven me crazy" "She?s the melody of my breath, she means the world to me" "What?s my heart, I could give my life to her, if she asked me for it" There?s this beautiful fairy... "she has descended from the skies..." she stands before me... "she?s the one I have fallen in love with" I have fallen in love with her "When she looks at me with a smile..." my heart goes out to her "Her charms are as enticing as she is" "it?s her dreams I?m lost in, all day and night..." "she?s the one I see when I awaken every morning" There?s this beautiful fairy... "she has descended from the skies..." she stands before me... "she?s the one I have fallen in love with" I have fallen in love with her I?m glad she?s taking a bath! Anjali! I?m here to take you away! Come on out! What brings you here...? Who are you? You?ve forgotten me so soon? - Oh yes "My CD-player, TV set, oven, refrigerator are all working very well. Go away" "I request you one last time, sir. Please don?t stop me" "Give my Anjali to me with your blessings," Don?t you feel any shame at all? A boy and a girl love each other... so what?s there to be ashamed about? A girl? - You think she?s an old hag? I get it! You?ve fallen in love with Anjali"s riches! Tell me... how much money do you want to forget Anjali? "Don?t weigh my love in the scale of wealth, Radhesham Tiwari!" "Shut up, you beggar! What have you got to lose?" I?ve earned name and respect in this country and the world You spoke sweet words and led her astray... and she drove you crazy with her silly antics "But remember, she?ll never leave me to go away with a pauper like you!" "Really? If you?re so confident, call her here, you old fossil!" And ask her in my presence. - I?ve asked her several times... and she has answered me too! - You?re lying to me! If she says the same thing to me... I?ll live all my life with half a moustache! "You need to have whiskers first. Go away, before I call the police!" "Not even the military can separate two lovers, do you understand?" I know you?ve locked Anjali upstairs. - How did you get to know? "What else can you do, Tiwari? Quietly hand over Anjali to me..." or I?ll have to go upstairs and break the lock! "To do that, you?ll have to step over my dead body!" "That?s enough, Radhesham. If I don?t take Anjali away in 24 hours..." I won?t be Jeetu from Videocon! - Think of another name. Go on! "You have 24 hours, Tiwari" "Stop me, if you?re truly your mother?s son!" Right now! I?m willing to pay 10 for each of them Send seven strong guys here right now. And listen... each one of them must wield a gun. And every gun must work "No, it?s not a bank. I have a priceless antique item" I can?t see it being robbed in front of my eyes The hospital bill is so high I don?t know how I?ll ever repay you. - Your husband has paid the bill He borrowed the money from me at 10 per cent interest Not every girl has a husband like yours "Anjali, the taxi?s waiting" Listen! Let?s run away! - Now? Yes. I?m ready "No, not now. Maybe a few days later" You?ve always been saying later "You haven?t fallen in love with your fake wife, have you?" "No, actually you?ve misunderstood me" That letter... - It?s still with me "If you betray me, I?ll have you thrown out of this house..." and I?ll show that letter to everyone and give you a bad name "Don?t do that. You are the one I love, but I feel scared..." "if Popat gets to know, he can send us to jail with his money power" All right. Come out Come out! You will do as I say. - What? The two of us will elope in a few days Where to? - There is a place... Popat can never get to! - But... Don?t worry. Just go and hide in some cheap hotel Where? There?s a hotel opposite the station. Stay there and behave like a madman I?ll come there later and say that you?ve escaped from the asylum I?ll take you to the railway station... we?ll take a train and run away! Is that necessary? - Yes "If we leave together, Popat will get suspicious" "If we leave separately, he won?t even guess we?ve eloped together" Someone?s going to help me! - Who? The police. Sub-inspector Waghmare I know how to entice him. Okay? But make sure you carry enough money from here Don?t worry. I?ll take so much cash and jewellery... we?ll have a honeymoon all our lives! Rob something once I?ll tell the Marwari and send you away on a honeymoon forever I know you?ve hidden him somewhere! Have you got rubbish for brains? I?ve told you... "I don?t have another son, I don?t! I don?t!" So who was he? - How am I to know? "Radhesham, don?t test Teja"s patience!" "So you don?t believe what I?m saying? - No, I don?t!" "Are you sure? 100 per cent? - Sure, hundred per cent!" Okay. So listen The one you?re talking about is my son That he promised to marry your daughter is also true But I?m against the marriage. So I?ve hidden him away somewhere "Where I have hidden him, I?m not in the mood to reveal to you" Do what you will! Go away! You will now see what stuff I?m made of "Not only will I find your son, if I don?t take the two of you..." "beg in the local trains of Mumbai, I won?t call myself Teja-bhai!" Give me in the name of God! - He speaks for the beggars too! Radhe! Radhe! Why did I leave my village and come to this hell? "Hey buddy, someone fishy staying here? I?ve been sent by the Garbage King" Talk to me You... Ask me what you must to. - Who are you? Babu Bisleri. The mole Is there someone hiding here? "Yes, he?s the one" Who is it? "You? - Yes, me" Why have you come here? - Where have you been hiding? I went mad looking for you! You even gave the hotelier an assumed name I went crazy banging on every door! I?m the one who has gone mad You said your employer would go back in a week "He?s not willing to budge, so what do I do? Rot here?" It?s got to be very dangerous. Had I stayed there another minute... I?d have been crushed between garbage and my employer Never mind. There?s no point staying holed up here I need to decide something. - The Garbage King has already decided The marriage is not taking place. He?s out to kill you If the marriage does not take place before that... "He?ll beat me to pulp, right? Never mind that" Here?s what you?ll do. I?ll give you a letter Quietly go and give it to Madhuri. No one must get to know Write the letter by all means. And also give me 200 rupees I?ll immediately take the letter to Madhuri... and no one will get to know! Swine! What did you think? You?d promise marriage and toy with my daughter?s honour? You must?ve betrayed a lot of girls. But you can?t deceive me! Forgive me! - Open the door... "else, I?ll break it down! I?ll break every bone in your body..." string it in a garland and put it around your arrogant father?s neck! Open the door! Sonofagun! What do you think? You?ll hide here and I won?t be able to find you? I can look at a fly and tell you whether it?s male or female! Open the door! - Chhota Chetan"s thugs! I don?t want to marry her. Leave me alone! "I?m here for your funeral, not your wedding procession!" I don?t want to marry her! I?ll go far away from her! Shut up! You won?t get the girl even in your dreams! "I?m going to kill you! Come on out, you swine!" Break the door Make mincemeat out of him and lay him at my feet! Thrash him! You play a drama with me? Get up! Who?s this? You said that scoundrel was hiding in there! That scoundrel told me. - Shut up! Leave this clown alone. And find that son of a bitch. Come on Hit me! Thrash me! Don?t let me live anymore! Just about anyone comes along and gives me a thrashing! When is the railway strike ending? I?m glad you came soon. Whom do you wish to see? "I?ll do it for you, but the documents of my house and 50,000 rupees..." you must quietly bring and give it to me "Sure, I?ll do that. - I haven?t seen... the party" Can I see him once? - You?ll find him at Welcome Lodge "If I ask for Nandu at Welcome Lodge, will they tell me?" "No, he?s going to stay there under an assumed name" I?ve asked him to pretend madness. That?s how you will recognize him "Welcome Lodge? All right, I?ll go to Welcome Lodge and meet your punter" I?ll tell him that you?ve sent me "I?ll get him out of there and have him at the train, the very next day" I?ll be there! Nandu and I will run away from there! Is there someone here who?s off his rocker? Is there a madman here? Ask the boss. - Don?t you act funny with me I?m warning you! I know it for a fact... that a madman has run away from the asylum and is hiding here! "A madman...? So say that clearly, sir!" That madman is surely hiding here! - Who? This one?s sure a nut. - A policeman! Officer! Get me out of here! I?m in a bad jam! They?re coming to take you away. - I?ll leave on my own How can you go away just like that? - What will you do about it? You can?t go away. Everyone knows you?re crazy... you?re mad "Officer, they?re hand in glove. I?ll tell you about them" Hands off me. - I?ll explain "They want to prove that I?m mad, take me away from here..." so Chhota Chetan can kill me! - See? I told you he?s mad! He talks any nonsense Get out... move it! - He gets into fights! So he?s one of them too! Why have you shut the door? Why? Come here! - What for? I?ve got to tell you something. - No thanks. Let me go "You needn?t worry, feller. I?m Inspector Waghmare" The other party has sent me here. - The other party? The other party will arrive exactly at 10 to take you away We got together and made the plan to deliver you there Are you one with them? - Yes God! Now I know why the police are terrified of Chhota Chetan! Damn it! I can?t figure out how such an atom bomb fell in love with you! "Not she, I was the one who "fell" "Ever since I was a child" Since you were a child? - I never imagined... this would happen to me! I?m leaving! I?m going! People will really think you?re mad. - I?m not mad! Get him! Hold tight! "Tomorrow morning, she and I will come to take him away" His expenses... you will bear. - Will I get some tips first? "Sure, if he runs away, you?ll get a tight slap" What are you telling me...? Anil has gone mad? He doesn?t step out of the room. He?s the only man... who?s living under an assumed name. - It must be Anil then "He wrote to me that he?s hiding here. - "That girl has betrayed me", he says" "He misunderstands you and says, Kill me! Kill me!" "Maybe he?s scared of your papa. Right now, he?s been hidden somewhere" "Tomorrow morning, they are taking him to the asylum" "Madhuri, why are you crying?" He?s in this state only because of me! I?ve been wanting to tell you something for a long time Go ahead "I?m not a singer, like you think. I come from a rich family" There was no dearth of riches and comforts in my house But my parents were against my music "They wanted me to take over the family business, and I didn?t want to" I began to feel suffocated there and I ran away from home Why?ve you telling me all that? - The drama we?re both enacting... could we really...? They?re here to take him away. Did he cause problems last night? "He did, I banged the hammer on his head and..." Is he dead? - No. Plastic cups don?t break easily I got to hammer his head again and take him away I?ll play the music for him. It?s days since I beat up someone I?m mad! I?m a lunatic! Not so much over-acting... don?t go overboard! He?s begun to speak! He?s not dumb! "I?ll carve you to pieces! Either you live, or l" I?ll kill you first and die afterwards! "Yes, carve me to pieces, kill me! Hack me!" "Calm down, Anjali" What will you get out of yelling? It?ll only attract the neighbours "If you lose your respect, how will you live with honour?" What respect is left to be lost anyway? Look at this letter! Written by her lover! "My dear Anjali, our hearts met and united at my shop" "I know, that old man is a shackle in your feet" "I did what I could to reason with that scoundrel..." but he just won?t agree! - Lies! This is a pack of lies! I?ll hack you to pieces! He further writes... "There?s just one way left. Tonight, I?ll quietly rescue you from that hell" Read it for yourself! Why do it on the sly? "Go away openly! Before that, end your relationship with me!" He got someone to write the letter! He wants to throw me out so he... can bring that young girl home. - Which young girl! No wonder he?s putting all these false proofs together! But that?s not happening! I will go away... I brought three cars full of gold... - You want that back with interest? Yes! - That?s what you want? I?m not giving it! I?m not parting with a penny. Do what you can! "Go away and file a case. Before that, leave the world!" Weep on Videocon"s shoulders! Don?t shed tears here I know Anjali very well. She can?t have an affair like the one you say "You mean, he?s having an affair? I know Mr. Tiwari very well" He?s not that kind of a man! "The less said about your knowledge, the better!" "Sir, trusting womenfolk is like committing suicide" I suspect you too are having an affair behind my back! Lawyer! Are you here to sort out my problem or create one for yourself? "No, sir. We must solve this puzzle" We can decide it only after we get to know who?s behind all this Who?s that boy? Let?s call him here Oh yes. Let?s decide this once and for all "I?ll call that boy right here. - No, sir..." I have a condition before you call that boy here You?re a very hot-tempered man. - Give that to me "You will reason with that boy, without getting excited..." or creating any scenes. It ought to remain in the family The two of us will go inside... he mustn?t think you?re humiliating him in front of the world "Speak up, Tiwari. Here I am" "Did you write this letter, Romeo? - What?" "Anjali, our hearts... - Yes, I wrote it" You wrote this letter despite knowing what the consequences would be? Yes. - Since you have so much courage... "tell me to my face, how much do you love Anjali?" Anjali means the life to me! You want to hear that again? - Lawyer! You? - Papa! So you were born of him...? It makes sense then "When the brand itself is faulty, this is how the showroom will be!" Boys are often naughty at this age "But the womenfolk must preserve their honour, mustn?t they?" "Watch your tongue, lawyer! - I see! The bitter truth!" "Whatever my son?s character, he?s surely better than you are!" You don?t even know how many sons of yours are roaming the city! What rubbish! - Listen boy. Speak the truth Did I ever tell you that I?m in love with you? No. - So then? "I?ve been talking about Anjali, his daughter" My daughter Anjali...? Which new daughter is that...? You also have another daughter! He?s lying! Absolutely! - O God! What am I hearing? It?s lies! - Something?s happening to me... Tell me the truth. How many wives and children do you have? My darling wife! He?s lying! - You?re the one who?s lying I used to drop her here every evening! One moment... where?s that girl right now? "Papa, this old man must?ve hidden her somewhere" God! What a monster! - He?s lying "Do you have any contact number? - Yes, I have her friend?s number" "Ask her where she is. Call her here. - Yes, call her here!" This is our Nandu! "He has run away from home. The informer will be paid 200,000" "200,000! Popat! You?ve hit the jackpot of 200,000!" "Let me see how you step out. It has to do with 200,000 rupees" "How did you get there? - Popatji, I?m leaving" Leaving? How can you leave just like that? Your picture has been published in the newspapers! "The one who takes you home will get 200,000 rupees" "Don?t mess with my reward, please. Stop there... stop!" Remember something...? Isn?t she your daughter? "Sorry, I made a mistake" They met in the garden as father and daughter. God! "Take me away! - God isn?t a weight lifter, fat lady!" Shut up! My child... am I your father? "You call her "My child" and ask her whether you?re her father!" Shut up... my child... am I your father? Hurry up and speak. It has to do with my married life! No What nonsense! You told me that you?re his daughter! That he hates the idea of you working in my store! And I even met you at this very place! Please forgive me All these misunderstandings are taking place because of me But please hear me out once "After that whatever punishment you give me, I will accept" I came to this city to look for a job "Despite the best of my efforts, I couldn?t find one" And when I got the opportunity to work at his showroom... I didn?t want to lose it. So I spoke one lie after another "To hide one lie, I had to lie many more times" That?s the truth "After a very long time, I?ve spoken the truth today" "Don?t cry, my child" What has happened is in the past. We hold nothing against you Where is your other son? - There she goes again! You want to see? You want to? I come here for the last time! "One problem ends, another one begins!" "Welcome, you?re the one we were missing. - It?s either this way or that today!" You folks don?t know what a dirty rotten scoundrel I am! I knew that the moment I saw you. - Silence! Where is my daughter? - What? His daughter? He always asked where my son was! And now he asks where his daughter is! Do you suffer from an affliction? - When you got to know... that I?d have my daughter married to your son... you had my daughter kidnapped! Where is my daughter? She has married me and is very happy to be with me What are you going to do...? - I?ll take your life! It?s not a toy. You might kill me! Put it away! Shut up! I could pump your body with lead anyway! I know all of you are conspiring against me! So everyone?s going with me. If anyone refuses... it?ll be his last refusal! Move it! "I?m going to bite you back, you dog!" Stop there! - Get him! Get him! "This is no garden, it?s my den. The den of death" Where?s my daughter? - It?s coming out of my ears! "From my house to here, you asked me a hundred times!" Which language you do understand? - Where is my daughter? "Tell me, else I?ll kill you!" You hit me! Wait there... You kiss my wife! You dare kiss my Mom! Freeze! I?ve got a pistol! Stay where you are! "One, two..." "Your father was dead, isn?t it? His son dies now!" Hey loony! Quiet! Hands up! How will I? Tell me where my daughter is. - She has committed suicide She has ended her life in a dry well! You poke fun at me...? The slugs in this gun are real You want to see? You want to...? Take a look Nobody moves! Else you?re dead-meat! "Stick your hands up, or I?ll send you to hell!" Hey hero... you want me to send you through the mobile? Stick your hands up! Go on! Listen... How much more will you make me run? Got a match? "Anjali, where are you?" Don?t let anyone escape! "Everything?s suddenly so quiet, isn?t it?" "Like the clouds clearing, after a storm" A lot of things are clear surely "I admit, I loved you because I thought you were Tiwari"s daughter" I have to give some girl the charge to my life some day "So I thought, why not..." Jeetu says he wants to marry me Nandu says that too Nandu and I have been pretending to be man and wife for many days So that consideration Nandu must surely get So you?ll marry both of us? - No "Actually, during the melee that took place..." I found a way out of this dilemma. - What? I?ve written both names on these chits "Whichever name comes up, I?ll marry him" "Nandu, you pick a chit. - I won?t! I always lose!" "No, not me! I always lose! - We have no other way, Nandu" I?m not picking lots. - I?ve prayed to God... He?ll help me choose the right boy "Jeetu, you pick a slip" I knew I?d lose! Nandu in this one too?
