We accompany our daughter to the monastery of Pescia, where our daughter will become a nun Then they must have a lot of money, Commander. They don't accept anyone for free at the monastery! I travel with permit documents, I do not carry money. You must have at least something of value in your possession. Give us back that necklace It belongs to my mother. She is braver than you! The Blessed Virgin will punish you if you do not return it How do you know girl Our Lady does what I ask of her It does not matter now ... that of the virgin Do you hear it? It is the voice of the Virgin. She is showing that she is listening to me. Shit! Tómalo! Have fun with your virgin lady Let's go! Good morning, Mr. Carlini Please follow me. Wait here. I know you've brought a new bride for Jesus Benedetta will be very happy with us We also brought a lot of oranges, apples, and wine. And you will get the same amount for the next twenty-five years. Every year. That's very generous of you, Mr. Carlini. And the deposit? When little Benedetta was born, she was about to die But she was saved by a miracle of God So I promised to give it to him. This is very moving. I have heard many stories like this. And every time she affects me But every year we see hundreds of beautiful girls who want to serve God. These are this year's competitions. And I can only accept three In exchange for your acceptance of my daughter, I will be happy to present you with a gift of 50 gold coins. Not counting fruit and wine, that's fine too, right? Outside these walls, the bride price is not less than 50 coins. Is the bride of Christ worth less? We can discuss it Seventy-five. Don't haggle like a Jew for 25 coins And after all, Giuliano, she is your sweet daughter. Agree. - A hundred coins! - We don't buy horses here! Your word is enough for me. and your invoice. It is a very big one. - But it's beautiful - Take off your dress. What is this? It belongs to my mother So that I can pray to Our Lady. Honey, here we have our own Virgin. From today you will pray it - But it's mine. - It's okay. Shut The dress, now Pica! It's terrible This. Calm your body I should be satisfied with that. When I was a little older than you While I was working they cut my finger off with a knife This finger is made of wood And I love him more than the rest ... ..if I could I would replace every part of my body with pieces of wood, To engrave the name of God on it And on your tombstone? You are a smart girl. Intelligence can be very dangerous, honey. and not only in others. Benedetta, she is here. Lady. This is the monastery room Use this tomorrow Oh mary my good friend Now you are my mom Please help. I am totally alone. I don't even know if you can hear me now. Benedetta? You got hurt? Raise the statue Did you touch the statue? No. Something happened to him and he fell on me - What were you doing here? I wanted to pray to the Virgin. Are you able to stand up? Yes. It is a miracle that it has not been crushed. It's okay. Go to sleep and let Benedetta rest. Come Mother! Wasn't this a miracle, perhaps? No gossip Miracles don't grow everywhere like breakfast Most of the time, they are just events. I didn't believe so much 18 years later I long to see my son, Jesus. I long to see her body again. Oh Lord. We know that you are immortal I saw an angel He told me that night Cheer up, your son will live And in your presence my brothers I pray tirelessly Oh noble lady, full of grace and wisdom You are our consolation Now I'll lay down in this bed made for me "Benedetta"! Come! You are my wife. Come now! I'm coming, my God! I'm going Come! Benedetta, your feet! This banquet was organized by us for our honorable guest Giuliano Carlini. Cheers. Let us also remember our beloved Bishop of Milan, who left us last week. Did you hear that the cause of his death was the plague? That's how it is. The bishop was a brave man But I doubted that this meeting would make you change your mind If this is the will of God, then the place of the bishop will be for his Eminence. No. No. This is really sad. To do this we must walk without shame, above our heads in the Vatican. And i'm not that kind of person And if the Pope notices this place on the map, it will be a miracle Let's hope for a geographical miracle Why did you move your legs? You should have been dead. I have seen jesus He called me I'm his girlfriend, right? Yes of course. Help me! - Open the door for me - Open Help me please! Open up! Help me! No, it's coming! please Get away! She ran away from me! You are mine, bitch! No, don't give up on me, please! Come. Come. You want to fight? They are in a monastery! I love christ. - Help me - I'm the father of this girl. - It belongs to me. - Let me stay here. But ... the monastery is not a place where everyone is accepted. You have to pay to stay here. you have money? - No. - Come on. Come on, that's enough. No! Let me! I want to serve the Lord! Please help her! We will pay your bill! Do you want me to pay a strange girl? I will pray for you all my life! Marvelous! Mr. Carlini The rich will not enter the kingdom of God Are you ready to pay? And you, mom, don't you do everything to get to heaven? Well. It will be a gift for you, Benedetta How to be a gift? My daughter is mine. You cannot buy it. - I'll give you ten dinars, no more - Bring it! Not the price of the dogs that will replace this bitch Well. That's great. Take a bath It will help you What is your name? I am Sister Benedetta, and you? Bartholomew Bartoloméa ... what? Just Bartoloméa. Is it mandatory to shower here? A pure soul requires a pure body The water is very cold. No, no, wait. I almost fall Will you stay with me for a while? Sister Benedetta? Your nightgown on the table Sister Benedetta? I need to defecate, where do I go? come with me. Are they real seats with drains? Where have you been doing that before? In the street with the cattle What a good feeling! - What a relief! - Shh! You can't scream like that at night! I hope this is not prohibited. Waiting. Excuse me, who did that to you? My father. Why? My mother died of the general plague of the past, then my father took me as his wife I always said I didn't want to, and he always said he didn't care. - As a wife, in the sense of everything? - If all. My brothers used to do the same, when the old man saw nothing Today I tried to stab him with a pair of scissors. He didn't like it, so he hit me. So i ran away Beauty can have a tax. Even if it looked like a sheep, the same would happen to me. Do you think me beautiful? Don't you realize it yourself? No, we don't have a mirror. You're beautiful. Can you see your reflection in my eyes - I don't see anything. - Come closer. Now look. What are you two doing here? I have brought the sister to the resting place. Who is she? Christina, the nun. And is she always spying like this? Father, I feel that Bartoloméa needs a mentor, but I cannot teach him God is the one who sent this girl. You need a lot of love and affection. Yes, it must be guided with an iron fist. not through me. May god guide you Save me, Jesus! What did these monsters want? Kill you These are the demons that tried to keep us away from each other. But they are stupid. Neither life nor death can separate us Stay with me. Yes Jesus I'll stay with you. Speak sister Dad. I have seen jesus - In a dream? - No. Of flesh and blood. How do I see you now in front of me When you saw it, how did you feel? ... fearfully. - So it was a false vision. When Christ becomes incarnate for us, we are filled with joy How do I know what is right and what is wrong? Through suffering Suffering is the only way to know Christ I know God wants us to suffer, Father ... but - That would scare me. - It's normal. God's voice is often terrifying ... the idiot says I'm not scared but I know he's scared to death Have you ever seen how a surgeon works? Do you really enjoy suffering? Keep praying and everything will be fine. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit And spools of silk thread? Do you know how much it costs? How stupid you are! You ran into me! Excuse me? - It's your fault. Stop lying. You are the reason. Saw that. - Take the rollers out of the pot - But ... the water is boiling. Get him out quick or I'll send for your dad. And now the rest Do I have to do that again? Otherwise, the reels will be damaged. No. Stop. What is it? What's going on here? Bartoloméa burned his hand - Come on, everyone to work! - Sister Petra! You need to go to the infirmary. Take it then You found out that one of your sisters had damaged the silk curlers, so you decided for yourself To punish her No mother. - No? - I didn't want to punish her, but to hurt her. ... you wanted to cause one of your sisters pain. intentionally Yes, by the way. Wasn't that a malicious motive? If you think it was for a malicious motive , I'd say it's true. Don't you know your true feelings? It seems I don't. Bartoloméa ... did something bother you? No. - Do you hate her for some reason? - No Do you have feelings for her? I feel ... sympathy. Yes. without suffering. Including what you did to him yourself? Yes, but Father Recordati told me that pain leads us to God and makes us stronger. ... our suffering. Without suffering from others. Your enthusiasm has gone too far I'll take your bread away for a week. And for two weeks, you'll change Sister Jacob's sheets You can go. I'm ready mother - Sister, I have to help you - Get away. I have had problems at work and I am proud of it. Pride is a mortal sin Everyone has the right to make mistakes. What is your sin I never did anything wrong. - But I know you can make a mistake. - Of course. Help me. ..my sin That I was Jewish. Sister Petra was a whore They all have children and a past, but nobody cares. And my father was circumcised This is a sin that cannot be forgiven. You just discovered one of my secrets. Do you call it that? God speaks in many languages If your heart is brave enough to open it up ¡Aléjense! Let the leading nuns come in! Help me! Save me! Tie it there Go find the doctor How is she? I watered it with poppy extract. she is sleeping Why is he suffering? I did not find anything abnormal. However, it was obvious that he was suffering. She was screaming for hours without stopping. You have black mucus in your urine. This happens a lot. What happens if the seizure recurs? I leave you the poppy extract Twenty dinars Why are you so cruel? Do you want to be with me? I want to be with you. No! No! No! "Jesus"! Thank you Jesus! "Benedetta" I will heal your wounds You are not Jesus! I am Jesus - And you are my wife! - No! This is a lie! Surrender to me! !Enough. I will cut you to pieces. You will have a roommate. Thanks. "Benedetta"! Are you feeling better now? I feel what God wants me to feel. I decided to put a companion next to you. Will stay with you day and night She will take care of you and pray with you. She will give you your medicine if needed. I don't want to be a burden Let's see if this helps. Bartoloméa is the perfect sister for work I hope there is something to appreciate in this selection. Maybe a lesson in tolerance Why are you here? Did you come to torture me? Did I do something to make you think that? How can you put something here? It's the dress I was wearing when I came here. Yes? It is a statue of my mother. She gave it to me when I was little Well, we'll put it ... there. The devil followed me I tried to hurt myself Now it's gone Have you ever gotten out of bed? I still don't feel good The head of the monasteries asked me for help. What is this? Preparation. I don't know her. I can teach you. Studying things didn't go well for me It is too hot. Is there something else? No thanks. I'm going to bed. Can I see a little? We cannot be naked in front of others. Oh really? I saw you! That was a joke. You really are the clown sister. Maybe. I saw your boobs. I saw them "Benedetta" "Benedetta" Do you want to suffer to show me your love? Take off your clothes We are prohibited from taking off our clothes in the presence of other people. And accept? You shouldn't be ashamed of me Do what I say Present, sir. I obey you. Come. Take away what divides us Put your hands on mine. Oh God. "Jesus. That's a lot! I can not anymore Help me. Help me! Help me! Jesus, who did this? Last night. He did this. This too. The stigmata! Were you in prayer when this happened? I was in bed, asleep, When did that happen. Saint Francis was in prayer when he received the stigmata Katrina from Siena too. Neither of us was asleep I was sleeping. - Jesus left these traces - He was 'Jesus'. Saw that. You've seen? I heard him speak And what did he say? I do not remember. I thought the word of God made more impressions. Bring sister Benedetta to my room Are you going to open the door? Wounds bleed non-stop Is deep Sight. The legs are the same. - It's swollen? - Even worse. How can this happen? I do not know. I have not seen this. What can we do? Keep clean Change bandages every two hours. Take off his cap. There is no blood. It's strange! When they put a crown of thorns on him Jesus' forehead was bleeding I see nothing Inspection is over And close the door Do you have any doubt? The girl was in bed Miracles don't happen in bed, believe me Then? what I write? The absence of scars on the head is puzzling All confirmed cases of scars included crown of thorns. Let's not write anything definitive You agree with me? - Your Eminence? - Yes, my daughter. I can go. Naturally. Do I have wine if you want? Gladly. Please let me go Do you think this miracle should not be believed? Dear director of the monastery, I think you do not believe it at all. Do I look sarcastic? Maybe. Only now I have the same vision This is very possible. Like the ones in San Francisco Assisi was an unknown people. Now the pilgrims flow to him like a river And they fill the treasure of the Basilica. That is ruled by a bishop, not an abbot Jesus, what's wrong with me? ..morning You will know! you sinners The plague is coming and it will be a terrible punishment! And I will save you from that with a blessing .. my wife And here they persecute, torture and kill whoever saves them! What happened? I have fallen. This is not a miracle. Your Eminence, this has gone too far. Do you want to bring the wrath of heaven on us? You heard the words she said just now. ... I heard words, but. - Will you laugh at me too? These disturbing words belong to the voice of the Lord. I feel this with all my heart This is a true miracle. How can you deny it? I do not deny it, Your Eminence. You are pretending to be good. And when I turn around, you stick a knife in my back. Hassan. Let's see what God will give each of us in life. Bendícenos, Benedetta. ¡Santa Benedetta! People want to believe that Benedetta has become a saint. But we know it doesn't make sense. Oh really? You said yourself that he had no scars on his forehead. The glass was immediately shattered. And the blood appeared. Did you see that? You were there? - No. - Then you don't know anything. I did not see anything. - But I know, - and how did you know? Did God incarnate you? Do you also have a vision? Why do you defend her? We don't always understand how God works. Maybe he put Benedetta in a trance ... and then she's in that state. His wounds appeared. ... or God drove her crazy. And that was necessary for something he wanted to say. I want you to give me your heart. Won't I die without a heart? You will live. you love Me? How am I going to live without a heart? I will give you something better My heart. Bartholomew. - What is there? - Jesus gave me his heart. It is a very big one. Too big for my chest. Check it out. Look how big it is. I feel so. Yes. - What is there? - Benedetta had a nightmare. Everything is fine. Good evening. Come on, go to sleep. Something miraculous happened to us. "Jesus Christ" Christ chose one of our sisters .. "Benedetta" We have all seen it And we hear the words "Jesus". Subahwa Lillarb Bless God. ... "chosen" by Jesus .. Therefore, we are the supreme authority of the Church. We have chosen Benedetta as abbot of the nunnery In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit Amen. ... to pray to our Lord Maulana This is impossible. Sister Christina ... what do you have? With all due respect to you, father. We. We, the sisters of this monastery. Who should we choose a new abbot from a monastery? And it's just us - Jesus, chose her. Your Lord and your God. It is the will of God. But who decides what the will of God is? Aren't we, sisters? -'Christina '- Get out of here. Immediately. Solved case. ..I will ask, to the abbot of the nuns of the monastery to deliver his mandate. Sister Benedetta. Come closer. What a bed! It's my bed, it's double. And it's all for us! Sister Jacob has fallen! He can no longer move. I don't think I'll get over this day. I will stay by her side and take care of her. Naturally. But someone will have to take his place during Mass. Today I will serve the first mass as abbot of the monastery. I think you should be there. Well, priestess in chief. I'll stay with sister jacoba Until dawn if necessary Excellent. Jesus said nothing about your condition He's making fun of you, but you didn't say anything. These are the rules of the game. In the end, everyone wins. The abbot of the monastery will become bishop and the monastery will receive financial benefits. Is this important? It may not be important or even useless, but I have dedicated my life to it. I was afraid of life, so I chose to give it to this monastery. Or maybe I was chosen for that. - But mom, you can't leave like this. - Call me Sister Felicita. ..but people need to know This is what is called rowing. What they need to know, they already know. If they don't lie, Benedetta ... Because they don't need this denial If you do that they will destroy you Everything is fine. I'm not going to defend you. It's time for mass, Sister Felicita. Ugly dream Dad. I need to confess. - at this time? - I really need it, father, please. Kneel before the cross before the Lord and repent. God taught me never to lie. This is why it is so urgent. Speak, renew your connection with our God "Jesus" the living Christ. It's about Sister Benedetta, I came to tell you that ... Are you going to talk about your boss? Yes. Yes, I'll talk about my boss. Your prophecy is invalid His miracles are false. She is the one who made all his scars, it is not your confession, my daughter. Did you come to blame someone else? I blame myself .. for the silence The thing is. Do you have any idea? The stigmata ... on his head. He picked up a piece of broken glass. He rubbed his forehead until he bled Have you seen that? Yes. Three. Yes? - Four. - Yeah right. No. You're hitting the pen too hard. I ruined it Can not. Come. Come. You want to see me? Show me deeper than that. deeper. Can not. My fingers are short. you want to try? Oh God. Oh God. No. No. No. No, no. - Yes. - No. No! - Come on, tell the chills now! Tell her! I can not stop. Jesus. Do you want more? Today's reading will be from Leviticus. ... but before we start I would like to ask a question that would break the heart of one of our sisters. Sister Christina. If something bothers you ... You have to express it. Do you want me to speak now? Here? This is your right. Take the burden off your heart, Come and speak. Let's talk. ... the head of our nuns. Deceive us. He lied to us. My dear sister explains what is in you. Do you want to complain about the main mother? ... I only know that ... what - What do you know, sister? Benedetta fooled everyone. She made her scar on her forehead. .. when you fell The glass broke and he was hit with it. Saw that. Christina, dear sister, what are you talking about? I'm sure the other marks on his body were the same. Sister Christina, Did you see that? How did our boss mother cut herself with glass? Is that what you mean? - Yes. I told the main nuns. What did you say to her? What i have seen What did Sister Benedetta do? Do you realize that perjury is a mortal sin? I do not lie. Sister Felicita, Told him. Did Sister Cristina tell you that she had seen Sister Benedetta? Rub his forehead with the glass? She was seriously suspicious. But did she see it? She came live! But was she present or not? No. She was not there Lie! She doesn't believe in me! She is possessed by demons! We have to punish her! Whip! - She must spank herself! - The devil must be expelled from this body! Take off your clothes! Cast out these demons Hit yourself, my dear sister. Well The rain stopped. I have a gift for you It will be more useful than my fingers. Do you want to try it? It could scratch. Actually. I'll fix it. Take off your clothes. You enjoyed it, right? What did you hear? Watching Christina spank herself Wrong No. This is something different. I was thinking of you. I thought how would you feel about it We tried? Slightly. it hurt? Not well. There is light Is a star? Sinner. The comet is just above the monastery. - What does that mean? - Indicates a warning from God. Something terrible is going to happen. No! No! "Christina" What have you done What have you done ... your silly little sister Sister Felicita, I want to put my hand on her to bless her soul. You ... don't touch her That is my duty. The soul of the suicide goes to hell. I don't want that to happen. Put your hands away. One word from me and I will save her from eternal fire. Shut up, you motherfucker! Let me! It's enough! Bitch! Vile joke! Bitch! She ordered me to do it. I know she is no longer the head of the nuns, but ... where did she go? To Florence. Sister Felicita left. Went to florence Why did you do that? To speak to the head of the monastery, I think. And what will you say? And what are you afraid of? Of everything. What do you mean? That the miracle is not real? I did not say that. ..AND That I cut my forehead myself with a glass? That's exactly what you did, right? It is not like this? I do not know. I don't know how that happened. I only know that God expresses His will through me. ..not just my skin. But this too. For! You disgust me. Is that what scares you? What would Sister Felicita say about us? What we do? Do you think we should be ashamed? Shame does not exist under the protection of God's love. God's Love. You love yourself - Then come to me. - No. Show me your chest Please. Do not touch it. She is not guilty of anything. Benedetta. Maybe everything will be revealed. Where is Teresa? at the hospital. It will not survive, Your Excellency. It probably won't. Three have died since Sunday. But I am not afraid. This is because you are so vibrant. The baby will be born in a few weeks. Milk appeared earlier. Enough! Do you want to add something? I've told you everything. Now everything is in your hands. Big accusations require massive evidence I only told the truth. You can doubt my motives. But come to Pescia You will see it with your own eyes. If your sight is true If something is wrong with Pescia, I can find out. And if that sister is really guilty of blasphemy, then there is a fire waiting for her. ... but if your testimony is false What will they do to you? Do you know it well? Yes. He. Oh God! Jesus! Pray! Jesus! Have mercy on us sinners! This is a sign of God's justice. The third angel blows the trumpet A great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch. The epidemic will affect a third of the entire Earth. It is an epidemic! It's the way to punish us! He sent a plague on sinners! O Spirit of Christ, sanctify me. O Body of Christ, save me. Oh blood of Christ intoxicating me. Oh water close to Christ, wash me! ... passion of Christ. Thanks God. I apreciate it! do not worry. The comet is a sign that God is protecting us! The plague will not infect Pescia! Jesus promised me. I am his wife. The city will be saved! Lord Jesus, protect us! Protect us from the plague! Thank you Lord Jesus. My God Jesus. I knew you would save us. Thank my God. Close the city gates. Don't let anyone in or out. This is the Lord's will. Close the door now. Sister? What's up? "Benedetta"! "Benedetta"! Is the grave for you? Answer to me! It's a message! Fall from the sky. The end is near! Get ready, people! Everything is written here, read it! These are the words of God! Bishop, come up with a solution. You, Your Excellency, may die. Don't let me die like this, go to the father of your diocese. He is the one who will take care of you. this is me! I am the father in my diocese. Tómalo! Open the door to the bishop! The door will stay closed! No one will go in, no one will go out! I am an envoy from Florence, open the door! Even if you are the pope, it doesn't matter We will not open! You are under my tutelage! Guardianship of the Church! We are here under the tutelage of "Jesus" himself! The door will stay closed! Your excellence I am the abbot of Pescia I am Alfonso Gilioli, the representative of the Pope! And I have to speak to the abbot of the convent. Unfortunately, I regret to inform you that Santa Benedetta passed away this morning. I'm sorry you came here. I'll stay with you at her funeral, take me to her. Let's go. The procession must stay out of town! Those who enter will be examined by our doctors. - Even you, Excellency. - It was God who sent us. And it's not you who is going to stop us! Let's get in! To open. To open. It is a great honor to welcome you, Excellency. - Did you choose a day like this for a show? - No, Your Excellency. Before dying, he instructed the nuns to celebrate their ascension to heaven to the Lord. - Is it another view of her? - Yes, Your Excellency. Just like that. The coffin will carry nine rookies. ... disguised as angels. The skin is clean. No sign of the plague - How did that happen to her? - Excellency, your passing was surprising. I'll prepare the burial. Do whatever it takes. You seem to have doubts. I never think I'm dead. That is so amazing. May the Holy Spirit be with you. ... and God's mercy and compassion. Jesus, don't leave me! Do not let me go. I want to stay with you. I was in heaven, in peace and quiet. But they got me out of there. I was expelled like a child coming out of its mother's womb. Jesus sent me here on earth. For what reason, mother? I have seen people who are about to die. I have seen all their souls and I have shed many tears. You saw my soul too, I guess? Jesus sent me down here. To save you from the plague and what will come next, from the eternal fire of hell. Don't worry about the eternal fire of hell, mother. Fire already awaits you here, in this world. The black plague is coming to Pescia. I was at the city gate, disguised, I saw crows singing and I saw the corpses. Rich, poor, women and children. And Jesus was there too. He promised me that as long as I am alive, you will be alive too. You are officially charged with blasphemy and sexual perversion. The procedures will start tomorrow. We haven't found anything, Excellency. Did you look everywhere? - Did you cut the bedding and pillows? - Yes, Your Excellency. any. Is so big It must be somewhere. Look again. What will you tell them? The Truth, what else? You can say something else. Apprentice Bartoloméa. Stand up. Stand up. Well. Sister Felicita ... Tell us what you have seen I have no words to describe this act. Please try it. I saw this girl naked with nothing. With the mother director, Benedetta. Can you be more precise, sister? They served each other ... each in their turn like a man with a woman. How did you see these actions? Through a hole, I did it myself. On the wall of my old room And that? Isn't it a mortal sin? - Spying on the nuns? - Today we do not judge the ex-nuns. We have to do it. Who knows if his words weren't dictated by jealousy? Also, Sister Felicita's testimony is just the beginning. and not the last. Bartholomew. How do you respond to Sister Felicita's accusation? This is the truth? Excuse me! I don't understand what he was saying. Have you looked lustfully at Archpriest Benedetta? lust? between one woman and another? this is not possible. The limits of what is possible in this monastery are very wide "Bartoloméa" Have you looked lustfully at Archpriest Benedetta? But with love. Everything I have towards the top. The nuns Benedetta is love. I feel the same for all the sisters. But you did not express this love. With the rest of the sisters like this, right? No. Sister Felicita, in what way this apprentice Bartoloméa ... Expressing your love for the main mother? He used a small wooden statue of the Virgin. Penetrating .. in Benedetta's genitals and giving her an orgasm. An unheard of crime. It is blasphemy that distorts the order of things. It is an abomination that deserves the death penalty. So bad! This is not true. This is not true. You can still save your soul, my daughter. If you confess. I have nothing to confess, Your Excellency. If you know everything that happened, why do you need my confession? Your confession will alleviate your guilt. You can still avoid. Burning and 'Benedetta' too. No. Strip her of her clothes You can save your soul if you speak. Well. I admit it. I had terrible ideas ... I hate Sister Juliana and wish her death. Now let me go! ..My little girl. This is not what we want to hear from you. ..for suffering. Have you seen something like this before? Joan of Arc was a brave warrior. But they gave him this. And then ... he confessed all his sins when he saw these tools. Don't pretend to be braver than Joan of Arc. You don't need to pretend anything. I already confessed it to you. I told you I wanted to kill Sister Juliana. I am guilty of murder. be merciful. I confessed it to you! You and I haven't met yet. But we are in the same boat. The journey can be long. or abbreviated. Let's pray that God illuminates our path. No! No! No! No! No! Sign in. What is love in your opinion? I guess love is not being alone. What is it. Feel hot in here. Does your leg hurt? Are you a leading nun and want to wash my feet? As a beginner, I washed it more than the others. Have you never touched a man? No. that's unfortunate. Because you are very sensitive to the natural desires of women. I don't want anyone but god. Are you trying to seduce me? Where does that talent for prostitution come from in you? I don't know what prostitutes have! And I don't ask you how you know her either. Playing with me is playing with fire. Literally. I'm not afraid. Naturally. Can you imagine yourself at the head of an army of light? Love is the only army I need. Love for Christ? Is this what you mean? Or the love of "Bartoloméa"? And for Bartoloméa too. Does Jesus have to share it? He gladly shares everything. With all the peoples of the earth. What we are talking about is here. This is not love for all humanity. This is something more special, right? La Bartoloméa is something special. And through her I show my love to the universe. And the universe once cut you with a little piece of wood, didn't it?
