Mm... Mm. This is nice. Nothing but us... We haven't done it like this in, like, a million years, huh? Or, like, maybe 12. Really? And you thought that was a good idea, to bring that up right in that moment, right there? I think I hear the girls. No, you don't. I thought we were done with this conversation. No, you were done with this conversation. Abby, you knew that I didn't want any more kids. And you knew I did, okay? And then you went and made it impossible, without even consulting me. But y... you hated being on the pill. Yeah, and you hated using condoms. Oh... Okay? But that's not actually the point. You never listen to me when we have this conversation. Mom! You know what? I could've just stopped taking the pill. I could've stopped taking the pill and gotten pregnant, and not told you... but I didn't. You know why? Because we're married. Married people actually have conversations, right? They discuss things! But you, you just went off and you got a vasectomy without even telling me, and now you... - Mom. - Hi, girls. -Uh, Mom... -Yeah? I think that it's really important that we can bring our phones on the trip. Oh, well, it's a daddy-daughter camping trip, so I think it's really unimportant that you bring your phones. Oh, great. This is going to be a nightmare. But a very special daddy-daughter nightmare. Um, guys, I can't go. Jessalyn is having an almost-back-to-school party. It's the first time one of The Populars invited me to anything. Oh! "The Populars." Uh, be nice. Jessalyn will have to understand that you already made plans with your family. What? Hey, you know what? You missing the party actually means that they are gonna be missing you. -Oh, really? -Mm-hmm. Alanna! That's enough. Mom? -Yeah? Uh, Aunt Josephine's... ...on the couch again. Okay. You went to the Populars' all the time! Oh, are you jealous? Your latte, madame. So good! JoJo, you have got to stop breaking into the house at night. Aw, you know you can't make a grand exit during a fight and then go home to sleep. Or maybe you don't know, being the perfect couple and all. -We're not so perfect. -Mom? Yeah? She's getting a photo booth. That is so cool! That means you'll have lots of pictures to look at when you get home. That's so not fair. A beer? Josephine. It is the perfect hangover remedy. That's good to know. Gabby, tell her. You can tell her, too. Come on, Olivia's 16, She can handle hearing stuff about... Listen to me. I love you, but our house, our kids, and we'd rather you not set this example. Ooh! Wilderness calls! I got it. Wild. Thanks. Everybody in. Okay, girls... You ready to go? Everybody in? Got your seatbelts on? Love you, too, sweetheart. I'll take care of 'em. -See you in a couple days. -Mm-hmm. You all in? Yep. 'Kay, I love you, guys! Bye! Don't forget to eat. About Ben's party... I just feel like I really need some "me" time. Mm-mm. No, you're not bailing on me. Friend time is "me" time. Dancing time. Fun time. Gabby doesn't know how to have fun. She's fun. She's charming. -Mm. -Mm-kay. Great. You remember how to have fun, don't you? It looks like this. Dancing... Dancing time. There she is. There she is! Wear those shoes! I'll pick you up in a few hours. I see you. Wow. Now, that's a look. Oh, I am totally ready to party. Oh, yay, Trish is here. I don't get your thing with her. Well, I mean... look at her. She's perfect. She's got the perfect hair, and the perfect dress, I'm sure her perfect kids are off volunteering somewhere, while her accessory line is on some perfect-person magazine cover. That was Good Morning, America. Yeah. Exactly. -Hi! -Hi! We thought you two had bailed! Oh, my gosh! You look incredible! Please, I've got "double-D" written all over me. "Divorced and desperate." Let's go dominate the dance floor. Come on! -I'm just gonna get alcohol. -Yeah, but then... Okay. Hi. Can I get a dirty martini, please? Thank you. Not your scene either? I was just watching that masterful escape you just made. This right here is really important. Every time I read it, I feel compelled to find out if Brocklehurst is gonna change. Ugh. Yeah, I hate that guy. I know... You don't know who Brocklehurst is. I do. Brocklehurst is the headmaster of the Lowood school. Total son of a bitch. Jane Eyre. I've read it four times since my feminist lit class in college... which, I swear, I did not take to pick up women. Oh. I'm sure. Uh, Matt Shaw. Gabby Cartwright. So I got peer-pressured to be here, by my friends. What's your excuse? I had a business meeting with Ben Winter and then he dragged me here to his party, and left me for the dance floor. And now you're part of this whole "Mommy's Afternoon Out." You have kids? Yeah, I have two kids and a husband and a white-picket fence. I'm just a total cliche. Well, you don't have the Botox and the bling, and you're not grinding with overly-tanned, pinky-ringed men. Yeah, no... this middle-aged mom does not grind. Well, I hate to break it to you, but 30-something is not middle-aged. Flattery will get you everywhere, Mr. Twenty-Something. 33. Oh! So old. I'm 42. There. See? We're not even that far apart. Let's see when you're 42 and you look back at how much has changed. Ah, I bet you haven't changed at all, because you look great. Well, that's very nice. Thank you. And that's my husband. Perfect timing. Hello? Sorry! You're breaking the no-device rule. What's going on? Everything okay? Uh, it should be in the big bag. No. I packed it. You're gonna have to look around for it. It's not just gonna jump out of the bag. Okay, you found it? Great. Okay. Bye. Sorry. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. It was just my husband and the girls, they're camping in the wilds of Vermont. And you restore furniture? What... How do you know that? I checked out your website while you were on the phone. You did not! Yeah, yeah. No! It's not even done yet. -It's so embarrassing. -Your stuff is great. Oh, stop it. Thank you. It's just... like a hobby. So you're one of those women that doesn't give a damn if you break a nail? Right? Look. You've got a callous. You're hand-shaming me. Uh, so I didn't get to stalk you on the Internet. What is it that you do? I'm in social media. Of course you are. Well, when I was in college, seeing each other face-to-face, that was our social media. I like seeing people face-to-face. Damn. I've got a meeting that I have to go to. Oh. It's cool. I'm sorry. No, don't be. -It's fine. -I have to go. But, look, I'm developing this new project in Hartford, 5th and Maple. Do you want to come and take a look, tomorrow at, like, 1:00? I think that you would like it. How do you know what I would like? Well, you love Jane Eyre... you make gorgeous things. It's right up your alley. Tell me you'll come. I'll think about it. You're gonna think... ...and then say "yes," and you're gonna come? I'll think about it. Okay. -Please come. -I'll think about it. What are we looking at? Shh. Who was that young man you were flirting with? Oh, we weren't flirting. It was more like a book club. Besides, he's 12, and I'm very married. Married doesn't mean "no fun." I imagine he would be fun. Well, there will be no "imagining" with Matt Shaw. Matt Shaw? Like... He didn't seem to mention that. He didn't say anything? Well, no, he said quite a bit, he just didn't mention that. Nobody knows the world of being a foster kid better than I do. 15 homes in 10 years, switching schools every time. I only made it to college because I lucked out with the Reardons in 9th grade, which is why I'm building schools, whose mission it is to give kids consistency, so they feel can safe, so they can soak up knowledge without worrying if tonight they're gonna have to move on. Today, I dedicate the first of what I hope will be hundreds of Reardon charter schools. Good? I think that's fine, right? Hey. Hey. That was cool. Yeah, you caught me, huh? Okay. I'm glad you came. Oh, okay, and this is gonna be the study center, where there will always be access to tutors in every subject. Must have been hard for you, to grow up like that. I'm not gonna say that it wasn't, but if I didn't grow up in the system wanting that connection with past friends and family, then I wouldn't have created Four4site... and without it, I wouldn't be able to build this, so... You know, I just... I want this place to feel like more than a school, like a home. And you have an eye for that. Would you consider coming on as a design consultant? Are you serious? Yeah, I've been thinking about working with repurposing existing pieces here, and that's exactly what you do. Sometimes, these things just fall into place. Okay, I've to go meet with some potential donors, which is far less intriguing than hanging with you, but think about it. Claire? Hello? -Hey. -Hey! So much for the great outdoors, huh? Yeah, my weather app didn't mention torrential rain and wind. -Hello. -Hi. So, before the girls come down for dinner... we shouldn't be talking about it yet... But... she can't keep a secret. You're pregnant! Oh, my God! We just found out. Oh, that's so awesome. I'm so happy for you. We're not telling the little ones. I'm starving. All right, who wants a hamburger and who wants a hot dog? I want a hamburger. Hamburger, hot dog... A hot dog and a hot dog. I think we've got enough. A hot dog... nothing for you. Okay... Is it that they're pregnant? Don't. Don't. Don't. Gabby, if I would have known how strongly you felt... You did know. Gabby, look, I thought it was the fair thing to do, and I still do. You thought it was the "fair" thing to do? How is any of this fair for me? I thought you'd be all right. I thought that you would get over it. Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm really trying to get over it, but every time we have sex, all I keep thinking about is, like, "How... how could he not talk to me about this?" I mean, seriously, who are you that you would go make this decision on your own? What... What is it about our marriage that you would choose to do that? I'm sorry. Then reverse it. Re... W-What? I mean, if you're sorry, then reverse the vasectomy. No? So you're sorry... you're just not sorry enough. Gabby, just... Gabby, don't. Okay! Got everything? Yep!

We're good. How, um, how's Mr. Four4website guy? Oh... I mean, what we're doing with these schools is so amazing. What? Eh. You just... you light up when you talk about that guy. -Claire. -Okay.

When they told me that they wouldn't sell me the company, I just made them an offer that they couldn't refuse. So where... where is everybody? Everybody who? The everybody... the architects, that we're supposed to be meeting. Uh, there... was some rescheduling. But I thought that you and I could still... get together. Okay, I mean... it's one thing to be a little flirty over text, but... to be together and for you to be flirty with someone that you can't have... Are you absolutely certain that I'm flirting with somebody that I can't have? This is not a game for me. This is real life, you know? Like, I... I have a husband. I can't do this. Okay. So... Co-workers, and... if you're really lucky, friends. Friends. Okay. Hi! You're up? Yeah. I don't have the best news. I have to, uh, cover for Dipka at a medical conference in Santa Fe next week. Next week is Spring Break. Your sister has the girls. We made that reservation at that cute, little hotel in Montauk. Yeah, can we change that? To another Spring Break when the kids are away? Uh... The hotel has a spa. Why don't you just come with me? Uh, okay, but the idea wasn't for me to spa by myself while you talk G.I. issues, right? The whole idea was for us to be together, to reconnect. Mm. I'll make it up to you. I promise. "Private food" is that, like, gross-combo food that you only eat when you're at home alone. Hmm. So, like, mayonnaise and Graham crackers. -Ugh! Okay. Well... -Yeah. Well, I'm gonna do leftover pasta with some eggs and hot sauce and cheese as soon as I get home, and think of you. This is my workshop. Gabby... Your work is amazing. It's just a... a glorified hobby. Why don't you shut up and take the compliment? I'm really bad at that. Those chairs aren't done yet. They're gonna be super-cool when they are, though. This is it.

You don't look so good. No, it's fine, it's just I have a turpentine headache. I'm gonna take a nap. Yeah. This is a library, right? So we've got to have a higher ceiling, I think. Ah, there you are, and I've got the architects this time. I'm not staying. Okay... can you just give us five minutes? Okay, don't... Just... stay there. Was I that bad? No. You were that wrong. I've never heard that one before. Look. I forgot that marriage is-is... is fragile and... you can't do what we did, and still expect it to work. I really do like you. Y-You can't. Okay?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, God. Come in. Okay, so, the reason I've been a raving bitch lately is...? Well, it's not menopause. You're pregnant. Are you sure it's not menopause? Positive. It would really be better if it was menopause. Can... Can you check again? Will... Will you just check again for me? I checked again. Pregnant. Congratulations. I mean, that's... that's amazing. That's great news. Right? I mean, right? So, like, I don't know, I'm just curious, off the top of your head, do you have any idea what the chances are that I get pregnant if, let's say, my husband had a vasectomy? And I'm... I'm... I'm asking for a friend who this happened to recently. 0.05%, maybe? That much, huh? She's gonna be bummed about that. She's gonna be really bummed. Mom? Mom, can you make some melted butter? You know, you're gonna have to make it yourself if you want it. I have to go out back and work on something. Here, have some. Damn, damn, damn. Damn. Oh... Such a disaster. What am I gonna do? Don't have the baby. Try to save your marriage. Don't have the baby? Elliot'll never know. Just do it and... and... try to go back to your normal life. I feel like I've wanted this baby for so long... It's like the biggest blessing and the worst thing that could possibly ever happen. And Claire... you know I could never have an abortion. Elliot. El. What? Gabby, what is it? I'm not stupid, Gabby. I'm not saying you're stupid, but there is a possibility, a 0.05% chance that... Don't. You know that's not what I mean. But-But there is a possibility. Is that really what you believe? Okay. All right. You look at me and tell me honestly that you think that we won some bizarre lottery here. Elliot, I... I... If you're honest with me, I can deal with anything, all right? But what I can't deal with is lies from you. Look at me! I don't know how to... I don't know how to tell you. Tell me what? I only had sex with him once. -No, stop. -It was just... You know, you only had sex with who once? Matt Shaw. Elliot. -I'm telling you and... -You did that? -I love you. -You slept with... It didn't mean anything. You're pregnant with someone's baby who you slept with? -I don't want to lose you... -I thought you went to... ...Don't want to lose this baby. -...A sperm bank or something! -You hear me? Listen to me! What do you expect me to say? I don't know! I-I-I... I thought maybe we could figure out a way to work through this together. Work through this? Elliot, please. Just try to... try to look at this through my eyes. Just-Just for a second. We are such an amazing family, the four of us, and this would just be someone else to love. Someone... Someone who would love you back, that wouldn't have to know... I would know! All right? I would know! You're asking me to raise a kid who-who isn't mine? Who we'd be lying to for their whole life? Elliot? Elliot, please! Listen to me! Elliot. Elliot, wait a minute. Where are you going? Elliot! Where are you going? Mom, what's going on? It's okay. Everything's okay. Just go back to bed. Go back to bed. Where's Dad going? No... Elliot! Hey. This is Elliot. Leave a message. Uh, El... Elliot, it's me again. Uh, can you... can you please just call me back? Or text me back? I just... I just want to know that you're okay. Mom... Mom! Why'd you sleep on the couch? Oh... Look, where's Dad? He promised to make omelettes this morning. Uh, he's... he's... one of his patients had an emergency. Elliot... we have to talk. No, Gabby, I can't. Where am I supposed to tell the girls that you are? At work. Just leave me alone. There has to be some way that I can make this right to you, okay? Please. I am not in love with Matt Shaw. Just things were... were so off. Oh, that justifies it? No, it doesn't justify it! Of course not. Whatever was going on with us is what was going on with us, but you slept with another man. And you had a vasectomy behind my back... How am I supposed get over this? Every day, there'll be this kid in our lives who will be a reminder of what you've done. So, I mean, are you saying that if I don't have the baby, that you'd come back? Because I-I can't, that would break me. No, I would never ask you to do that. But I don't want another child. How could you do this? I don't know. I just... Honestly, I just wasn't feeling good about us, or about me, and the girls are growing up so fast, and then it-it happened, and I realized it was all .... Really? Because now it's a new life. Hey. Hi. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. Oh. Oh... Oh... Are you sick? No. I'm not sick. What's going on? Mom? Okay, no. You know what? You need to lay off the whole you're "the grown-up" and "we're the kid" part already, because walking out on Mom when she's pregnant, that's not a very grown-up thing to do! I get that you feel that way. No. Don't you talk down to me. You're still my child! Yeah! And you know what? This is about your new child! It's not his fault! It's not his. What? It's... It's... It's not... his. Mom. It's not your dad's baby. Gabby, I wasn't going to tell them. No, I know, but they have to know the truth. They can't blame you forever. It's not your baby? Olivia... Olivia, listen to me. Please. Olivia. Olivia. How do you just sleep with somebody when Dad is so great? Who is it? You don't know him. It doesn't... It doesn't matter. He doesn't matter. Oh, so you just slept with somebody who doesn't matter to you? That means we don't matter to you? Is that what that means? Of course not, Olivia! -Dad! -No, don't, Olivia. -Dad! -Listen to me, right now! -Dad. -Olivia! -Dad. -Olivia. Can I please come with you? O-Okay. Maybe, for now, maybe that's the best idea. Elliot. -Listen to me. -Okay, go. Olivia! Mom! Mom? Do I have to go, too? No. No, you don't. He's here. I have to talk to him. I know he's here, because his car's out front, so please, please, we have to talk... Okay, yeah, yeah, I get... I know. Yeah, he's still here... He doesn't want to talk to you. I'm sorry. I think he just needs some space. Maybe if you give him a little more time... he can learn to understand. I'm sorry, I don't know... I love you. I don't... Let me... Let me drive you home. Let me... It's okay, Claire. ♪ A shadow That just never stops ♪ ♪ Look at how much It's cost ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Are the void I cannot fill ♪ I was told tequila was inappropriate right now. I mean, at least Olivia's talking to you. She's not even talking to me. 16-year-olds aren't supposed to talk to their moms. I still don't talk to Mom. I'm such an idiot. You're not an idiot, Gabby. You're human, and humans screw up. You just didn't know that before because you never did. All you can do is move on the best that you can. What does baby-daddy Matt have to say about all this? Gabby! What a happy surprise to see you on my calendar. It's really good to see you. Come on, I've got something I want you to see. I can't believe it's coming together so well. Those kids are so lucky to have you. I'm just lucky I can help them. So, uh, I mean, do you want your own kids someday? You seem to love them so much. Uh, no. No. I know firsthand what it's like to have parents who aren't ready to take care of you, and I could never inflict that on anyone. That makes sense. So, tell me why you're here. I just... I think you'll make a great dad. You're sweet... but not in the cards for me. Mom? Dad got me the dress I wanted for poetry day. Oh, you mean the one I said you couldn't have? -Yeah. -Great. Excuse me! Hi. "My name is Alanna. "I like llamas and I like Michelle Obama. "I have a mother and a father, and I'm the best daughter. "But don't tell Olivia, my older sister, "because, trust me, she'll be bothered. "Bye. I'm Alanna. And again, I like llamas." Um, so, I-I stopped by the realtor's office, and they're gonna have someone call and make an appointment to-to value the house. Wait. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? Why would we sell the house? Well, we're not living together anymore. We need money for separate houses, and, uh, and selling the house is the easiest way to get it. Yeah, I don't want another house. Okay? I want our house, and if we're able to work through this... There's nothing to work through. So what are you saying? Do you want to divorce me? You haven't left me any other choice. Hi. Hey! I've been texting and calling. I wanted to come by and see the baby. How are you? Flabby. Emotional. Tired. You don't look any of those things. How's Elliot? Don't. Ah. Well, we had coffee the other day and he told me he wanted to sell the house and... Gabby, what do you want me to say? Say that it's fine? He's fine? I'm fine? Olivia, she's doing great? You know, it's super-easy having an extra two lost people living in my home while my third child has colic. I'm sorry, Gabby, but I just... I can't be there for my family, and Elliot, and Olivia, and you right now. I get it. I get it. Come on in, everybody. Come in and set up. Extra mats are on the wall... Gabby... Alanna! Alanna, no, stop! Alanna. Alanna... Hi! Ow! Alanna! Everything's changing. I hate it! I know, honey. Me too, honey. You don't get to hate it! Hi. You know what I was thinking about? Remember when we used to go to lunch, and then we'd go to a matinee? Uh, yeah. Um, I have an AP Chem test right now, and that sounds a lot more interesting than this. Okay, can you slow down? Because I'm really pregnant and I can't move that fast. You're gonna stay at our house tonight. Okay? With me and Alanna. Uh, no, I'm not. Olivia, you don't just get to stay where you want to stay, because you're unhappy with some of the things that we're... Oh, "some of the things"? Some of the things? Okay... most of the things. Why are you calling it "our" house, when it's not gonna be that anymore, because of you? Okay, I know, I suck. But Olivia... I'm your mother, and I love you so much. I hate you. Okay. Hi, Gabby. That's right. You call us whenever. Yeah. That's right. You forgot to revoke my wifely walk-by-the-receptionist privileges. It's on the to-do list. Okay, about the house. Well, I'm not planning on coming back there anymore. It's our house, mine and the girls, and I want to keep at for them, for their stability. So I want to buy you out. It might take me a while, but... I promise you, you'll get your fair share. You're neglecting the fact that you need money to buy me out. Yeah, I know that. I'm working on it. Oh. Him. Right. "Him"? What do you... What do you mean, "him"? Him? No. No, Elliot. Not him. I have nothing to do with him. It's me. I'm keeping the house. So you really think that we can turn this yard-sale obsession into something profitable? I think, to start, we do a furniture pop-up sale. I'm almost done rebuilding your website, and I've a few stores to still call. I don't know... You need money for the house, It's Elliot. Elliot? What? You held down Josh Gordon and cut off his hair? You told him it was "too gay"? Dad, I made a mistake. No big deal. No big deal? That boy... That poor boy! Who are you? Look, it was a dare, okay? A dare from who? The Populars? They said I could be one of them. Okay. Honey, I understand, but... What? You... You "understand"? Yes, I understand that her home life right now is very complicated... It doesn't matter how complicated it is! God, Elliot, it's not about us. Of course it is! "Us" is what has allowed this to happen. You mean me? Well, I'm not the pregnant one. Okay, and I'm not the one that said you'd be fine with anything, and then I tell you the truth, and then you're not fine. Seriously, Gabby, you're not able to see the ripple effect of what you've done. Your actions have had a ripple effect as well, and you know it. Look... we have to try to make this work for the girls. The girls are the only reason I'm even still trying. Apologies are so, so, so, so, so hard. You say you're sorry to Dad all the time, but... it doesn't... it doesn't change anything. He's never gonna change his mind. Well... that might be true. And that would suck, but... it doesn't mean I stop apologizing. You know, I did something wrong. I have to apologize for it. ♪ Go on and break the mold ♪ ♪ Don't let them tell you You're too young ♪ ♪ To know ♪ ♪ This life is yours ♪ ♪ And can be anything You want it ♪ ♪ Don't let it go ♪ ♪ You've gotta plant that seed to get it ♪ ♪ Just watch it grow ♪ ♪ Come on and live your best life ♪ ♪ Sing it loud ♪ ♪ Just let your voice ring out ♪ ♪ They won't bring us down ♪ ♪ So live it up ♪ ♪ You'll make it unmistakable ♪ ♪ Dance like it's the last time ♪ Hi, guys. Uh, look. I don't want Christmas for you to be like Thanksgiving for me, because it really sucked, so I thinking maybe Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, you could come over and we could all celebrate together. Uh, just... think about it. You know? I think it'd be great for the girls. Okay. "Okay" you're gonna think about it, or "okay" you're gonna come? Okay, I'll come. O-Okay, you're in? -Yeah, I'm in. -Okay. -Okay. -Go back inside... -...before your feet freeze. -Yeah. Okay. You're in. Crap. Crap. Crap, crap. Gabby! -Hi! -Hey! Hi. I-I-I didn't see you or hear you, or... anything. Uh, I gotta go. Okay. Okay, yeah. It's good to see you. Okay. Matt... Oh... Gabby, that's... that's great. Yeah, I should have told you. Uh... Why should you have told me? Well, Elliot, my husband, had a vasectomy, so... The baby isn't his. The baby's yours. Um... were you gonna tell me? I mean, I tried to tell you. I did try to tell you, but you said that you didn't want to be a father. Remember? And I don't know, my life kind of exploded, and I was functioning under this delusion that withholding information from you was fair... and it wasn't. So... Um... I understand if you don't want anything to do with him. "With him"? It's okay. It's okay? You should have told me, Gabby. This is not okay. This one's got to be from Aunt Diane, and hopefully, it's a new iPad, but I am sure it's not. Yep... Handmade wool hat! Oh, itchy head. Itchy head! Ahem. Um... we'll be upstairs. Um, thank you, guys, so much, I will be playing this all night, and Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. We love you. I, uh... I'd better get going. Uh, Elliot, Elliot. Wait one second. One more present. Oh, I didn't... I didn't get you anything. It's okay. It's okay. Here. It's for you. I can't accept this. I'm seeing someone. And I-I didn't plan on telling you this tonight, so, uh... Uh, no. No. Okay. Uh... I can't expect you not to see anyone, right? I mean, look at you, you're... It's Trish. It's Trish? Oh... You know, she's... No. Listen. Trish... Trish has my seal of approval. Not that you asked for my seal of approval, but... You couldn't be dating anyone with, like... you know, less flaws than Trish. Yeah. Uh... Well... Well, I am... I'm... really glad we did this for the girls. You know? I'll see you in the morning. Okay. I'm sorry, baby. I know this isn't the happiest way to bring you here, but I promise... once you get here, Mama's gonna figure out a way to make it all better. What did you get Mom for Christmas? You didn't get her anything? Okay, okay... You guys didn't wake me up. Oh, we figured you needed a rest. What about Santa? Mom, you know we know about Santa. And we're doing presents after breakfast this year... family decision. It's time to flip. Out of my way. Oh! Honey, I can... We've got it under control. Oh. Okay. Uh... Where are you going? We're eating. I gotta go upstairs just for one... We're not gonna start without you, we waited for you. Yeah, Mom, I'm starving. Oh! Okay... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -You can go, you can go... -No, no, no, no. -...And I will take a cab. -It's okay, it's okay. -Ow, ow, ow, ow! -Breathe, breathe, breathe! You gotta breathe, breathe, breathe... If this is anything like Alanna, we got to get you to the hospital now. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My hospital bag is upstairs. You guys go get my hospital bag. Oh! God! It's coming too fast. Okay. Gabby, you need to let go of me, and grab onto the bed for a moment. Elliot. Please? Alright. -Okay. -Shh, shh, shh, shh. I'm so grateful you're here. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Gabby, one more push! One more push! One more! Push. There you go. Almost. Here he is, guys. Good work! Oh! Hi. Hi! Henry William Cartwright. Cartwright? W-Wouldn't he have another last name? No. It's the same as my last name. I have to go, Gabby. I have to go. Hi. Hi. I waited so long for you. You have no idea. I did, and now here you are. I'm gonna love you so much. Yeah. And you have two sisters and they're gonna love you so much. And we're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Next year, we'll get you into the other middle school here. A clean slate. I know that apologizing wasn't easy and... I know that being expelled was really hard. And I'm really proud of you making the best of this, Alanna. How can you be so nice to me about all these crappy things I've done and you can't be nice to Mom? It's not that simple, kiddo. How about a burp? Want to burp for me? Okay. I know. I know, I know, I know. Okay, that's third sweater today, little guy. Girls! Are you guys ready? Because if your dad gets here, and you're not ready... You know he... He's here! Hurry up, okay? Come on, he's here! Hi. Oh... Hi. I just, uh... I just needed to... Yeah. That's cool. Uh, Henry? This is Matt. Matt, this is... Henry. Holy crap. Yeah. I made that? Well, I did most of the heavy lifting, but if, you know... Mom! Can you tell Alanna that... Girls... This is Matt. This is Henry's dad. Hold this. Sorry, she's not normally so rude. Actually, that's debatable. Olivia! Whoa, whoa, just wait a second, though. Uh... Gabby? Hey. Olivia. Matt has a right to meet Henry. I mean, I don't know if he wants to be involved... Involved? Involved? No, no. Look at me. There's nothing between Me and Matt, except for Henry. You know, if it wasn't for him, we would still be a real family. Sweetheart, we are a real family. I mean, maybe not the way we all thought it would be, but we are. And I need you to listen to me, okay? Because this is really important. You were right. You're right, this was my mistake. But this is where we are now, so we have to figure out a way to move through it. I just... I just want things to go back to how they were, you know? I'm doing the best I can. I really am, but it's a lot. And I need you to try to accept Matt in the family. For Henry's sake. Gabby? Try for me. Gabby! Hi, Dad! Hey. Olivia's running on Olivia time, which means I get shotgun. I forgot my phone. Hey. Who's that, uh... Who's that walking with your mom? That's Henry's dad. I gotta... Yeah. 'Kay. So Monroe is the girlfriend... a model girlfriend. A model girlfriend with a degree in Engineering from Cal Tech. Oh! Fancy. I think you'd like her. He stopped crying. See? I told you! You just keep trying every trick until something works, or you wear each other out, whichever comes first. I have a lot learn. Yes. Yes, I remembered the tiramisu. I did not forget. Okay, sweetie. Bye. I'll show you to a table. Please follow me. Gabby? Hi. Hi, guys! You look great. And this little guy, how adorable is he? Well, I think so. Thank you. Hi. Uh, so are you guys here to eat? That's a really silly question. Of course, you're having dinner here! Yeah, we're, uh, we're meeting friends. -Fun. -They're at the table already. I hate being late. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Hi. Well, you think you're done dating and then you are couples-dating. Uh, look. Elliot, I want you to be happy, because I think you deserve happiness and-and I screwed up. I did. And it wasn't because of you or anything in the marriage, and... there are days now that I wake up and I actually don't hate myself. But I have to tell you that... Henry is... not a mistake. He's wonderful. He's sweet and a gift... And he makes my heart so full. So I can't apologize anymore. I get it, Gabs. You do? I do. Elliot? Elliot, their sitter has a hard out and they've been waiting, so we really should... Yeah. Of course. I'm coming. I'm sorry, Gabby. You understand. Of course! Or would you like to join us? Oh... no, that's sweet. She's so sweet. No, no. That's fine. I've got the kids at home and-and take-out and leaky boobs. I'm a disaster. Okay. It was nice to see you, Gabby. I guess I should... Go. Go, go. Hi. Here you go. Sorry for the wait. Oh, thank you. That was a lovely evening. Elliot, I was thinking. I know you said you wanted to stay with a friend in Vermont, but then I remembered this inn that Leah told me about. It's spa heaven, and we could use the get away. A couple of couples' massages never hurt anyone. We'll bring the kids some other time... ...And someone just canceled. Elliot? What? I booked it. The hotel. Elliot? Let's go home. Gabby, hi. Trish, I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I missed the sunrise yoga so Claire convinced me to sneak into this one. Claire. So is this it? This is how it's gonna be now? Forever? Um, maybe not? I hope not. Uh, Trish, would it be weird to ask you to say hi to Elliot for me? It's...it's weird. I know, I know. It's weird. Okay. Bye. Gabby? Yeah? I'm not going to say hi to Elliot for you. I know, that's so weird. I'm sorry I asked. Considering that we're not seeing each other anymore... So I think that you should say hi to him yourself. Now. Really? Really. And Gabby, don't blow it. You were meant to be together. You just really are impossibly perfect. Thank you. Hi! Excuse me! Bumpy! Bumpy-bumpy. Bumpy. Bumpy. Thank you. Gabby? Gabby, stop. I need to talk to Elliot. No. Don't go up there. What? He revoked my walk-by-the-receptionist privileges? What? No, no. He just... I can't do this. I gotta go. This was a big mistake. Listen. Trish told me that I should... -But I need to tell him myself. -Tell me? Tell me what? Hi. I was, uh, trying to tell you that he just ran to the coffee truck and he'd be right back. Oh. Is everything okay? No. Everything is not okay. I should be able to wake up next to you in the morning, and-and roll over and stare into your eyes and-and say hi to you for myself. I'm sorry in a million ways, I regret hurting the man that I love. And I want that man back. Elliot, I do. I want you back. And I totally get that it's impossible because Henry and I are, like, you know, a package deal now, and... it's more than you bargained for. Gabby. I know. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. No, no, no. Just... wait. Look, you're not the only reason that we're not waking up in each other's arms every morning. You told me, and I wouldn't listen because I was too busy blaming you. And I wasn't able to see or-or admit to my hand in where we ended up, and I don't know... I don't know when I stopped talking to you about us, or stopped working on things, but I did. And... I am sorry in a million ways, too. You know how much I love a package deal. Especially one that includes you. W... ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh... ♪ ♪ Oh... ♪ I can't find my phone. Olivia, can you call my phone?
