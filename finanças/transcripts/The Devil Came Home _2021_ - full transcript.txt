Sh... Jesus Christ Tim! I'm really sorry. It's all right... honestly. I've ruined the day before it's even started. It's not your fault you can't help having nightmares, it's not like it's something you have control over is it. I was just hoping they'd pass to be honest. I thought they had. You could always talk to Pete you know. Why Pete? You've been talking to him about me? No. I hope not, because what I went through, it's really personal and I don't want every man and his dog knowing about it. I know you don't like to talk about things it might help, and Pete isn't every man and his dog. No he's the consummate professional isn't he. Morning. I'm sorry.... that was really shitty of me, you... you didn't deserve that. It's all right. I'd better get ready for work or I'm gonna be late. Try and get some rest. You all right sweetheart? Well I would have felt a lot better if someone hadn't woke me up this morning. What the fuck? Move get your arse out here! Get off me you fucking lunatic! MUM! What's this? What's what? Don't you play the innocent with me, I'm really not in the mood THIS! This your idea of a joke, hey? What the hell are you talking about? Dont' you bullshit me? A little dig at my condition is it ay? It's funny how you walk in on that conversation yesterday and all of a sudden this appears on the mirror as if by magic, all by itself, ADMIT IT! ADMIT IT...! Get off me or I'm calling the police... MUM! For Christs sake Tim, let go of her! TIM! Get off me! What the hell is going on? THIS! What? I... It was there! I'm telling you I saw it, Elaine I, I saw it. You're insane. Mindy. No he is Mum! It's because of you we're living here dragged me away from all of my friends from everything I knew. Mindy stop. No I will not, it is all about him, it always has been since you met him. Well what about me? I never even came into it did I! Mindy that's not true. Yes it is. and I'm sick of it and I'm sick of him. It was there, I swear to you I saw it. Elaine. I'm sorry! Stay away from me. I'm going to check on MY daughter. Mindy Leave me alone sweetheart I mean it. I'm sorry. I have always told you you EVER put your hands on my child... I don't know what come over me I'm really sorry Elaine. Sorry is just a word. There are only so many sorries you can say Tim. When I saw them words on the mirror... What words, there was nothing there Tim, it's all in your head. Na I saw them. They was there. I am so angry right now, I am this close to leaving. I'll get some help and don't you EVER touch my baby again. He just freaked out. No I don't hate him, I'm just pissed off because he bruised my arm, he needs help... I wish you were here too... I'd love to see you... I'll have a chat with Mum and see if she's okay with it, hold on, Yeah! I just wanted to say um sorry about earlier. I don't know what come over me, but um, no excuse for what I done. Okay, I'm on the phone. Hello? I just want you to relax alright. You've been having these dreams a while. Yeah. Would you like to tell me about them? Probably think I'm stupid. I'm not here to judge you Tim. I'm here to listen and to help if I can. I keep... seeing this man. In your dreams? Yeah. and he troubles you? Yeah. Why? it's like he's.... trying to overpower me. In what way? It's like he's... trying to take over my life. I know he's dangerous and I'm trying to keep him away but he's just too strong. Does he remind you of anyone? Someone from your past? I wouldn't know he, he wears a mask. What kind of a mask? Goggles, a respirator and... a hat. Does he ever say anything? does he ever speak to you? Never. Tell me a bit about yourself Tim, past occupations, hobbies, that kind of thing. Um I was in the army for 22 years.... Has Elaine been talking to you? No, this is strictly confidential. Well, I've been struggling a bit lately, well... a lot, I got diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, I don't know why I'm telling you all this, not something you want to talk about is it, ...depression... I usually feel too ashamed to bring it up. You served your country, there's no shame in that. Yeah well when you are serving your country you, you do things because you gotta... without thinking... it's only afterwards when you do start thinking... about the things you've seen the things you've done... that it really hits you and then you come home after 22 years and you can't even find a place to live 'cause the council can't house you... cause you figure nowhere on their little points chart... and you realize nobody in civvie street gives a shit and you start thinking what the bloody hell was I fighting for. Had a few breakdowns, at least I'm alive unlike some of the others. Others? Mates you know, friends... from the army... dead now... suicides. I'm sorry. Yeah... so am I. Shhhhh... Tim? Tim? You know not who I am, but I know you. You know not who I am, but I know you. You know not who I am, but I know you. You know not who I am, but I know you, arghhh. Mum? RUN! What? RUN! Elaine? Elaine? What's going on? Mum, you're going to kill him! Mummy DON'T! Get the jacket! What? Get the jacket. Elaine!...no no it's okay I'm not home I came back to the office, what time is it? Slow down, slow down. You've done what? Let me get this straight, you knocked him cold with a baseball bat. Yes. 'cause he put a knife on you? Yes I told you. and now he's upstairs in a straight jacket. Where the hell did that come from? Tim bought it because of his condition, he said that if he ever felt he was becoming a danger to me to us, he'd put it on himself. But you put it on him Elaine, after you assaulted him and you got Mindy to help you. Where's this knife, this mask? I don't know, why are you interrogating me when I was the one in danger? Because that's what the police are gonna do when they get here. There aren't gonna be any police. What d'you mean? Exactly what I said. They'll only release him, that is if they bother to hold him in the first place, and then I won't be safe. So what are you going to do? keep him up there indefinitely? If I have to. Eventually you'll have to release him Elaine, what if he goes to the police? what then? you could find yourself in a lot of trouble and not just you, Mindy. Have you been listening to anything I've said to you? You haven't seen what he's been like these past few weeks Pete, I've been scared to death in my own home. and I am not letting him go until I know for sure that he's better. So where's this mask? I don't know. I looked everywhere except the bedroom, he was coming round and there was no way we were going back in that room until you got here Would you prefer me to take a look? You're here to release me right? Elaine said you were brandishing a knife wearing a mask. Mate, I woke up, she'd gone, I went to look for her and she does this to me. If I was wearing a mask and threatening her with a knife, where are they, hey? I never said threaten. Look we both know I got some problems, I ain't denying that But I ain't the one beating people over the head and tying them up in a straight jacket am I. Release me. Release me this is insane! If you don't let me go now, when I finally do get out of here, I'm going to be pressing charges against you and all. I think it's best you calm down. Calm down are you fucking serious Look I've got two women downstairs terrified. and they say you're the reason. You believe them do ya? Where's the mask Tim? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm only asking you a question. I'll answer it for you shall I? it's in my head, do you know why? c'ause it ain't fucking real... can't you see what she's trying to do here? she's trying to make me look even more insane than I actually am. As far as I can see, up till now Elaine's done nothing but support you. You call this being supportive do you, hey? all after some mask that don't even exist, If that's the case you won't mind if we'll take a look around then will you? Would not. What? what did you say? I said yeah, I do actually. There's nothing up there... I looked. I saw it Pete, he was wearing it. When Tim came to see me, he talked about a masked man in his dreams he said he felt this man was trying to overpower him in some way. But that's all that was, a dream what I saw was real. Well maybe you dreamt about the mask because he hid it from you, never told you. You mean like his dirty little secret? Maybe so... maybe he wore it because it excited him for some reason, maybe he hid it from you because he was scared what you'd think. maybe it made him feel like the man in his dreams. Jesus you're talking about him like he's real. But to Tim he could well be. I think I'm gonna go out of my mind at this rate. You said he spoke to you in a foreign language... would you have any idea what that was? I don't know, Russian? why? When I was in the bedroom with him I could have sworn he spoke to me in an eastern european accent, when I queried it with him he just looked at me with this manic smile. What'd you mean? He smiled but there was no reason for it. Would you stay here Pete? just for a few days while I figure something out. Figure what out Elaine? While he's still here, I honestly can't see a resolution to this. You sure you don't want to call the police? And say what exactly? they'll only release him without charge and then what am I gonna do? We are not staying here on our own with him and I am not putting Mindy in danger. If it comes to it we'll disappear leave him up there on his own, I'm serious Pete I'll do it. Alright, I'll stay for a couple of nights, but I honestly don't see what good it's gonna do. Thank you. Murderer It's not mine It's Tim's he was in the army remember you could get five years just by having this regardless, this is not a good situation Elaine. False imprisonment, assault, possession of a legal firearm the list just goes on and on. If and when this whole thing comes to a head don't think questions won't be asked. I'm not the one who thinks there's somebody else Peter. but you are the one who's being affected by it. Elaine! How much longer do you think this can go on for Elaine? I just need time to think things through. Elaine! Elaine! I need the toilet. Murderer. What did you call me? I didn't call you nothing. I finish. We need to talk. You must have heard it. Didn't hear a thing. Last night when I was asleep, someone whispered the exact same word to me in my dream. It was him Pete. You're talking about a dream Elaine Replayed back to me in reality Peter. Probably just a very bizarre coincidence. Why would he even call you that? He's ill. There must be something you can do. There is, there's lots of things, but therapy for these types of conditions can take months, if not years to make any kind of headway, I can't just magic up a diagnosis or even a treatment for that matter. Well as far as I'm concerned, he can piss and shit himself for months, if not years, I am not letting him go until I know it's safe, Do something... please? There is one thing we can try, I'm not saying it's going to resolve anything but it might help give us an insight into what's going on here but we'll need his permission. How the hell are we going to get that? We ask. I haven't had a chance to talk to her yet, it's not that simple, well you haven't been around here the last few days, he's gone off his head, Alfie he's fucking nuts he needs help, just come round okay I've invited you. I didn't ask to move here did I, so I shouldn't have to ask permission for anyone to come and see me especially you I just want you here Alfie, so just get in your car and come over. He'll do it, but only as long as you're in the room with us. Great. So what you gonna do with that thing? hit me over the head again? If I have to. What's the purpose of this little exercise? Gonna try and help you to relax put you in a good place. Well not threatening me with a baseball bat and let me out of this thing might be a good start. Need you to help me for this to work. If you could close your eyes for me, I want you to imagine you're on an island, it's your island... walking along the beach, you can feel the warmth of the sand under your feet feels great, take it in, you sit down and stare out at the calm tranquil ocean, the warmth of the sun beating down... Tim? Tim, I'm going to count to three... My name is not Tim... You... try to trick me, sun is not my friend, If the sun isn't your friend, then what is it What's wrong with him? I don't know, I've not had this happened before, Shit, I knew I shouldn't have done this. Just give me a minute alone with him, trust me... he makes one move I'll be right outside, you need me, you just holler Why are you doing this to us Tim? We opened our arms to you, let you into our lives and now you're trying to destroy us, maybe we should just open the blind... NO not let sun in... or what? what's gonna happen Tim? I'm going to take a shower, I'm coming with you. Mum it's not like I'm four years old anymore he's in a straight jacket, what can he possibly do God mum, stop being so overprotective, between him throwing me about and you suffocating me, I'll be the one that ends up in the nut house before long not him. I was looking out for you I'd rather you kept your attitude and your smart remarks to yourself with everything else that's going on around here at the moment, I really don't need it. Everything that's going on around here is your fault mother, you're the one that brought him in the house and you're the one that defended him on everything he ever did. He was ill. Maybe he wasn't the only one. What exactly do you mean by that? Think about it I'm going to take a shower. Now you just hold on one second You're both under a lot of stress right now and don't take this the wrong way but maybe she has a point You think I'm making all this up, I was talking about... I know what I saw Pete, There was blood everywhere it was literally coming from every orifice. Why are you looking at me like that? you think I'm crazy? I didn't say that. no but you're thinking it. Elaine it's not about what anybody thinks, it's about the facts, or in this case a lack of them. I'm not saying Tim's not ill, because he obviously is. but by the same token you've made some claims that have no substantiated evidence whatsoever to back them up. a knife and a mask that we still haven't found, Tim whispering something to you in the bathroom, that I never heard, but you heard previously in a dream, in a dream Elaine. Tim bleeding to death, but when you close the blind, miraculously he's fine again you've got nothing, and should Tim press charges there won't be a court in the land that will believe any of this. It's him... Don't you see it's Tim making me see all these things. Stop, listen to yourself it's... Insane Is that what you're saying, you think I'm insane Give it a rest. Oh God, all I need Why don't you go up there, open the blinds and see for yourself but if you do you are going alone because there is no way I am going back in that bedroom I'm not to the problem here Pete, he is. I'm calling Jonathan. You sure that's wise? What do you mean? Well his presence here might only serve to make things worse Well that's a bit unfair, considering you've never actually met him and unlike you he might do something. I'm sorry, Pete, I didn't mean that to come out the way it did, it's just that we need help, I need help, before I actually do go out of my mind. Mum! Mum! MINDY! MINDY, MINDY Unlock the door we can't get in. MINDY... MINDY... Mum! It's alright. Thank you for coming. It's no problem really Jonathan, this is Peter Hi. Hello. Heard a lot about you. Likewise. Do you mind if I see him? Tim Do you mind if I come in? I have been expecting you, Man of God. Tim? Now. How long has he been like this? Like this, about two days but in other ways a lot longer It's the last two days I'm concerned with, his behaviour prior to that could well be put down to his condition but this, This is something different what's your take Peter? I'm not sure, but it does look to be evidence of some type of disassociated personality disorder, to what degree, I don't know. I could only make a supposition based on what I've seen so far but I need a lot more time to make a more accurate diagnosis. What do you think Jonathan? Well I'm no psychiatrist not trained in any of those fields but seeing him like that did come as quite a shock to me. Do you think you could stay here for a few days maybe rota it with Pete? I don't want to be on my own with him and it would give me a chance to tell you more about what's been happening. Have you tried contacting the authorities? or maybe even the police? Just to keep an eye on the situation? We've been over that already? No police. But you know you're breaking the law, keeping him up there like that. Went over that too. I refuse to let you do this to us. Looking for something? You are very brave, to come in here all alone when you know what I can do. I know all about you, I know more than Timmy, I know what you did, too old for responsibility you said, and Timmy too ill for responsibility you said, you say you torture yourself, for what you do, That's right, run, like you always do PETER JONATHAN! Leave me alone...... What do you want from me? Elaine? Peter! PETER! I heard him Peter, I heard what he said to her, his exact words were, I want your effing soul. He's playing with her, don't you see, tormenting her. Well unless she speaks Romanian she wouldn't have had a clue what he said. You're saying he spoke Romanian? He came to see me for a session, he's been suffering with ptsd I know. Well that could account in part, for some of his erratic behaviour. Plus as a young man he served in Bosnia. Yes. But sir maybe he learned to speak Bosnian. Bosnian isn't Romanian and I do know the difference. I've known Tim a long time and the voice I heard from that room most certainly wasn't his. I think I know where you're going with this, I'm not a religious man, I'm a trained psychiatrist I can only see what my training has taught me to see a mentally unwell man, with a severe personality disorder. Yes I can accept your point of view but in your opinion and I don't mean reference books or case studies I mean your opinion, has any personality disorder or mental illness ever enabled anyone suffering from it to speak fluently in a foreign language? I wouldn't call one sentence fluent. Well according to Elaine he's done it before. I'd appreciate an answer Peter. I think you already know the answer. What's the concern to me, is what you might be suggesting I'm a priest and we simply have avenues to investigate, when all else has failed. I wouldn't say I failed. No no I wasn't suggesting you had, all I'm saying is, in my opinion, that man up there is in no way, the same man a close personal friend I've known for over 40 years. Jonathan... she's gone. What? Elaine she's gone. Now let's not be rash about this she's probably just gone out for some thinking time. She hasn't been out of the house for four days. Well I'd still feel better if I knew where she was There's a lake across the way from here you can see it from the field out back, Mum likes to go there a lot when she wants to be alone. Mindy did say alone. I'll come with you, make sure you find her. Thanks. I'll stay here then shall I. Do you need to talk to mum? Yeah. I'll wait here. We used to come here when we first met, the soldier, I was smitten, I knew he had problems right from the start, but it didn't matter. The army sent him to some terrible places. What happened in Bosnia? It was the first place he was stationed, imagine that. A young lad joins the army and they send him straight to hell, because it was hell. I didn't know him then but I know what it's done to him. I never thought he'd leave the army, when Mum died he paid his way out so I wouldn't be on my own. I bought the cottage with the money that Mum left, thought it would be a fresh start for all of us Mindy included, I never imagined that anything like this would happen I know you think he's got issues and you'd be right Pete, but this is different, that thing that we've got locked up there in the bedroom is not my husband. I know that sounds strange but it's not. and I don't know what to do about it. Jonathan Jonathan. I see you are dressed for battle. Jonathan. I miss you Jon... why did you leave me? You are not my mother. I was Ill, I needed you and you left me for God. What God takes his son from his dying mother? You are not my mother. But you did leave her on her own to die, did you not, Man of God. Maybe you should have just married the bitch instead, you know you wanted to, You left her Man of God, just as your faith will leave you. Jonathan? You're saying he turned into your mother? No..... I'm saying he played a trick on me somehow, on my mind. How?.... how could he possibly do that? I don't know, all I know is he did and not just me he's playing with us, all of us and we need to be aware of that. Look, as messed up as all this is and if he was doing that, which with all due respect I very much doubt, what could he possibly gain from playing games with us? I can assure you they're not games, and there is most definitely a means to an end here. What do you think it is? I don't know. If we found out, do you think it would help? I'm saying, if we know it's motives we'll know what it's doing here and why it's taken Tim. What I'm about to suggest I wouldn't ordinarily advocate, but I know a Psychic, a friend, of a friend of a friend if you like, But apparently she is very good, She'll call Elaine and the only reason I suggest it, is because I believe she won't detect a thing, which will leave us with what we started with, a mentally unwell man that needs help. Thank you for coming at such short notice. You're welcome. Peter, Bernadette, nice to finally meet you. Hi, how was your journey? He's upstairs... isn't he. Yeah. Well... let's meet him. Do you mind if we stay down here? No of course not, I totally understand I'll stay with them. Now I want you to write down everything that I say, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you, and I can't stress this enough do not omit a thing, I'm sorry to put you in this position But at such short notice, I couldn't get my usual guy. Right... let's get started shall we. Oh and one more thing, no matter what happens or what I say or do or how I say or do it, do not interrupt me, or attempt to stop me, that will be the single most dangerous thing for me that you could do. Do you understand? Yeah. I repeat, do you understand? Yes I understand. Good... then let's begin. Good afternoon. I have been waiting for you. Alright... I think a different approach might be needed Castle... ...Murderer.. ...Blood... ...Vlad... ...Baby....... crying.... Baby... dead... ...Murderer... ....war.... ...Battle... ...DEATH.... You alright? Yes I have to try again. You sure? Yes I'm sure Blood ...murderer... ...London... ...baby... crying... Jack... Jack... ...baby... ...dead... ...Elaine... ...muderer... ...Hemmings... ...impaled the bodies... ...Dragomir... You see her, don't you... we have same gift... What happened in there? it doesn't matter. What does matter however, is what you're dealing with here. Which is? A strigoi. I'm sorry... a Strigoi? Yes A vampire. I know what it is but all due respect we called you because we wanted help, not some fantasy story. You called me because you needed help and that's what I'm trying to give you Pete let her speak. Don't tell me you're buying into this? It was you that called her, remember. I just want to hear what she has to say. What does he want? his name is Dragomir and he has existed in one form or another for over 700 years. and he has lived and died on this earth twice, in that time. The first time his life was taken was over 500 years ago, murdered in battle a stake to the heart... Jesus! Pete. It's all right, this is not for Mr Richard's benefit, it's for yours. At the time of his death, he was allies with Vlad the Impaler, who himself had a penchant for drinking blood. He healed Dragomir by bathing his body in the blood of more than a thousand fallen warriors and as dramatic as that may sound, it's true. You are familier with the name hemmings aren't you. That's my family name, why? In the 1880s Dragomir stalked the streets of London and was responsible for the murders of at least five prostitutes. Jack. Yes Jack, only he was found and murdered practically mutilated by a gang of local residents led by a man named Albert Hemmings, Your past generations Eaine, your bloodline. How do you know this? because I saw it and you don't need me, or a psychiatrist because we cannot help you What do I need then? An exorcist. Jesus Christ. Me?... just because I'm a priest, that doesn't make me an exorcist.... I wouldn't know the first thing about performing an exorcism, I wouldn't even know if it was the right thing to do. I'm serious... You all know as much about exorcism as I do. If that really is the case, why didn't he just possess Elaine? Because he wants to torture her... and worse. For the one man she loves the most, Tim, for what her bloodline did to him, and not just you, your daughter too. I'm not trying to frighten you Elaine, I'm trying to help you. Oh... there was just one more thing, something that didn't make any sense to me, I kept on hearing a baby crying and and then I saw a baby dead and someone continually whispering the word murderer. Oh God... this can't be happening. I know you're opposed to me Mr Richards, you think I cause more harm than good, but all I'm trying to do is make you aware of the entity you have in this house, and of the danger Elaine and her daughter are in. What happened up there? I saw my daughter, Rebecca. You've lost me. Ten years ago, I was involved in a car accident my fault, Rebecca was in the passenger seat, she never survived, to this day I've never forgiven myself. Sorry. That thing you're up against, it knew about that that's what it meant when it said we shared the same gift When I connected with it, I opened myself up to it, as much as I opened it up to me and I don't mind telling you I'm terrified. It's calculated, manipulative, intelligent and very dangerous and in all the years I've been doing this I've never had a subject feed me so much information, so readily it's a different animal, supremely confident. If it gave you all the information so easily, how'd you know he's telling the truth? I don't but I know what I saw, and that's all I do know. You have to find someone who can perform an exorcism and you have to make sure it works, and I for one do not want any further involvement from this point on. I'm sorry Mr Richards but please.... do not call me again. Penny for them? What do you think? ...Do you think Bernadette was genuine? Well I don't think my opinion really matters. It's all about Elaine now. nothing more. This situation, Tim being held against his will, The church would never accept it. It's not like you want to do it, Do you see an alternative? I see lots of alternatives, but like I said my opinion doesn't matter, but I will say this. Sometimes we're put in situations where we have to make informed decisions based on what we think we know, sometimes making those decisions means breaking the rules, now from your perspective breaking those rules means the possibility of identifying and exercising a demon, whereas from my perspective, you attempting that exorcism, would prove beyond doubt there never was any demon in the first place. But either way, you break those rules we get to move forward and unfortunately Jonathan, you do need to make that decision because as harsh as it may sound, the future of this family may well depend upon it. How are you? I've been better. What was it you wanted to speak to me about? Father forgive me, for I am about to sin. What is it, you are about to do? Something the church would frown upon greatly I think. Is what you're doing a bad thing? Not necessarily. But not necessarily a good thing.. either. All I know is, some people need help, a family. Then I ask again, what is it you are about to do? I'm going to perform an exorcism. Without the consent of the church? Why? Because given the circumstances I know the church would never consent to it. Are you trained? No. Have you had any previous experience in this area? You're entering very dangerous waters I Know. With your lack of knowledge and experience admitted to in your own words, you could be doing more harm than good here and if you are dealing with a genuine possession and this goes wrong, you could be endangering the very well-being of this family not to mention their eternal souls. I take on board what you say father, but I'm trying to help, if I were to merely stand by and observe I feel I'd be contributing to the danger this family is already in And if it becomes common knowledge and you are exposed you could be exiled from the church. Aside from the fact that what you propose to do is illegal. I know. Who is this person you're going to exorcise? are they known to you? He's the father of the family they were in my congregation until they left the city and he's been a close personal friend since childhood. As you know him so well, would you, in your opinion consider him possessed? He's show signs... That's not what I asked... I'm trying to explain... I wasn't looking for explanations, I was looking for a definitive answer. The church itself, based on evidence submitted to it could take up to 12 months or more to make a decision on whether or not to grant permission for such a thing. Then I would have to say yes, he is, because from what I've seen and know... I don't think this family's sanity alone has 12 days, never mind 12 months to make a decision And there's nothing that can be said that would sway your decision on this matter? No... not that I know of. The church cannot condone your actions, you know this, and I have explained to you the possible and most likely probable implications and outcomes which could result from what you are about to do. I thank you for coming to see me. You obviously understand the relevance and importance of this, but I cannot give you absolution for something you haven't done yet. So, all I can do from this point on is to give you my blessings may God go with you may God be with you. Thank you father. He's still refusing to eat. You're going through with it then? Yes, I've printed off prayers source reference materials, holy water. Where'd you get that? I had to break some rules. When do you intend to do it? As soon as I possibly can. Much as I applaud your decision, I just hope you're not rushing into this we don't have time to waste Tim hasn't eaten for over four days he can't go on like this, neither can his family. Do you think you'll be able to do it? I'm not looking to exorcise the demon Elaine I'm looking to expose it, that way, maybe I can go back to the church state my case, get them to fast-track their permission for an exorcism by someone more experienced in these matters. How do you propose to do that? By making it reveal itself, draw it out any way I can, but I'll need your help Alfie! Hi Mrs B. What are you doing here? I invited him. Just a moment. What the hell do you think you're doing? I wanted some company mum I'm here on my own. In case you haven't noticed we have a situation here. How could I not notice, all you ever talk about is him him him well what about me I have needs and how soon you forgot about me in this house. Oh sweetheart I'm sorry... Forget it, just forget it. I don't want to hear it, I just want it to stop, He's not right in the head, he needs medical help. That's enough! I can't believe he did that to you. He's not right, he needs help. Do you know what I'd love to do? I'd love to go in there right now and bust him in the face. Come on Alfie you're not a fighter. But he's a dinosaur if I can't put a beating on him now I've got real problems 'ant I. That's not what I meant You're not like other guys you're sensitive and caring, it's one of the things that attracted me to you. Right. but you're my girl and he's put his hands on you. and you're here now and that's all that matters, I love you Leave.... or I'll kill the girl.... What did you do mother? he won't even answer my calls. I didn't do anything. You must have done, else why would he leave in the middle of the night, no messages nothing. Mindy I was here when he left, your mother was asleep Hello... hello! Alfie I know you can hear me. Alfie... Alfie. Him. you fucking bastard, GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME NOW! Get off me, GET OFF! You have to stop this Mindy, this isn't doing anyone any good Good? what good is this? you honestly think the situation is healthy? We can't wait any longer, we have to do the exorcism tonight. Come to me little pigs, Oh Lord, hear my prayer... ...let my cry come unto thee. to grant us thy powerful protection... to keep us safe and sound we beseech thee through Jesus Christ our Lord... ...amen. Got it. You may see things you're not ready to see, What about you?... you ready? Almighty and most merciful father, may your blessing remain always in this home, and upon those who live here through Christ our Lord amen. I have already given this house my god's blessing. O lord hear our prayer and let my cry come unto thee O lord to grant us the powerful protection and to keep us safe and sound. We beseech thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen. Forgive them father for they know not what they do. Is your camera running? Yes. Lord have mercy... Lord have mercy Christ have mercy... Christ have mercy Lord have mercy Be silent. I know about you Richards I know all about you... Oh Mummy don't leave me in the bedroom, I don't like it Mummy it's dark, I'm scared little mummy's boy. Don't listen to him... don't listen. holy mother of God holy virgin of virgins, Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel, Saint Raphael, all holy angels and archangels, all holy orders of blessed spirits, Saint John the baptist Saint Joseph, all holy patriarchs and prophets, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint Andrew, Saint James, Saint John, Saint Thomas, Saint James, Saint Philip, I command you unclean spirits whoever you are, along with all your minions now attacking this servant of God, by the mysteries of the incarnation, the passion, the resurrection and the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the descendants of the holy spirit by the coming of our Lord for judgment that you tell me by some sign your name, and the date and hour of your departure, I command you more over to obey me to the letter, I am a minister of God, despite my unworthiness, nor shall you be emboldened to harm in any way this preacher of God, or the bystanders or any of their possessions. Jonathan! Don't do this please, he's hurting me.... he's hurting me! They shall lay their hands upon the sick and all will be well with them may Jesus son of Mary Lord and saviour of the world. through the merits and intercession of his holy apostles Peter and Paul and all his saints show you favour and mercy amen... with me amen. amen. Jonathan why are you doing this to me? why are you hurting me son? Why? You are entering very dangerous waters. THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU! THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU! The power of Christ does not compel me man of God, it repulses me and if you dare spill one more drop of that holy water on this body which I dominate I will free myself tear your fucking heart out. It's all right, we've got what we need we've got what we need. Go... GO! Did you get anything at all? Nothing. Doesn't make any sense, it was on record the whole time. It got to you somehow it got to you and I failed. Forget the camera, we both saw what it did, what it said, I'll come with you, to the church. Don't you see, it doesn't matter, the time it would take for the church to respond, and even then they'd turn us down. We have no evidence, just our word about an exorcism that the church never even authorized, I've let this family down I've let a lifelong friend down that thing, up there, it won... and it won because its faith in its God, is stronger than my faith in mine and it knows it. Do you think this will ever be over? I don't know, I'm so sorry. What for? I feel like I dragged you into all this. Mum you haven't done anything... and Tim... when Dad walked out on us and left us... he was there, he's been more of a father to me than my Dad ever was. I never gave him a chance and I said some horrible things about him and to him and the truth is I love him Mum. I'm so sorry. Father... Why hast thou forsaken me? Jonathan. Jesus Christ! Jonathan, Jonathan! Can't feel a pulse. He was weak, too easy... not like Mindy. You lay one finger on... And I take her. I come for YOU. Mum what's wrong? Mum? MUM! Elaine! Stay away from me, You! Elaine. I'm sorry I'm so sorry you gotta pull the trigger, kill me, you gotta do it... you gotta end this. I didn't mean to hurt you, nor you. You are no better than man of God... ...weak... ...no faith... coward. Death of daughter, will be on your hands Elaine NO! Elaine, we can find a way around this. He'd done nothing wrong and I killed him... I was trying to protect you you know whatever you're thinking about doing... don't. I'm so sorry! MUM! Hi. Hi Pete, sorry for calling your office today Hey it's okay it's the end of the day, besides it's not like I'm that popular I'm making stew for dinner if that's okay? That'd be great thanks. Would it be alright if Alfie came over tonight? It's just, he keeps asking to see me I haven't seen him since. You don't have to explain, it's fine, it'd be great to see him again... ...one sec. Alan Lawson's here. Send him through, I have to go, I'll see you both later. Thanks Pete. Mr Richards? Come in... please take a seat. Would you like a drink? No thanks. You said during our phone conversation earlier today... you felt ready to talk. Yeah... yes I do. As one psychiatrist to another I just want you to know, I'm not here to judge you in any way. Thank you and I appreciate that but I think once you've heard what I have to say, you might find that quite difficult.
