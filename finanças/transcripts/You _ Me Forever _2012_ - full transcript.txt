NIMBUS FILM presents with support from THE DANISH FILM INSTITUTE in collaboration with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation Drink, Christine! Empty it! Drink, drink! Bottoms up! It's gonna be great! Christian, you have... possibly the world's biggest dickhead, so girls, what now? Shall we go all the way with that? No! Laura, sit. What the hell is he doing? It's freezing, Laura. I'll go get our stuff. - Can you sit by yourself? - Yes. I'll hurry back. Hey! What are you doing? Come down, man! - What are you up to, man? - What are you doing up there? Get a grip! You can't climb up there! Are you fucking spitting at us? Get down here, you fag. Come down! Who the hell are you spitting at? You dog! Who are you spitting at, huh? Are you looking for trouble? Who are you spitting at? What are you doing? - Hey! - Fucking loser! - Get lost! - Fucking dog! - Asshole! - More spitting? Who the fuck do you think you are? What are you doing? Hey! - Stay out of it! - Shut the fuck up. Little faggot! Who are you spitting at, huh? - Gross, bitch! - Can't you do that at home? Learn to hold your liquor. How old are you anyway? - Bitch. - Fuck, you're gross. - Time to get up! - No, Mom... - Yes! We're having lunch! - Don't! You stink! Phew. Join us, if you're hungry. Look at that. It looks totally insane. - Look at all that hair... - Yes, all the way down her thigh. Who has that much hair? And look, it's all over her... Just like Camilla and Martin. She's holding the mirror enjoying it. Disgusting. - Totally gross. - And look... What is she inserting? - How many in class have done it? - Simone... she's been with lots. Josefine did it with that 28-year-old guy. - Seriously? I thought that was a lie. - No, no. I'm sure of it. - She wouldn't say it otherwise. - 28? Can you imagine how big... Argh, gross. We're so fucked! This is where the sows are kept when they've been artificially inseminated and until they deliver. So, when they fuck... do you take part in that? - The boar doesn't fuck them. - You don't fuck them? Yes, we fuck them. - Aw, it looks so sad. - Look at that one. This is a 4-day-old piglet. We're anaesthetizing it. When it's been here 4 weeks, it's moved to a pigsty. Are you okay? Yes. - What? - Nothing. I'm just looking. - Well, I'm going back inside. - Wait. Why do you always hang out with Christine? She's my friend. Laura? - What are you doing? - Nothing. What did he say? He's just weird. Let's go back in. - You know Jonas... - Yeah? He's really weird. I mean, have you ever seen him talk to anyone? - Only you. - What? - Yesterday. What did he say? - Nothing. You were talking yesterday. Laura, what did he say to you? - Nothing. - Sure he did. No! - Why won't you tell me? - He didn't say anything... Yes, he did. I heard you talking. He was just weird. Do you have a crush on him? A crush on him? Are you stupid? We talked for 2 seconds! - Did you imagine him naked? - Stop... So, if he touched you and said he wanted you... Seriously, stop it! Stop it! Fuck you! It's not funny, okay? We'll have a little more, okay? - A little more? A lot more. - A lot. Another slurp, and we'll go party our asses off. He's probably in his usual 80s, nerdy shirt. Close the door. That's so typical of him. This place reeks of sweat. Hey, chicks! A drink? - No, thanks. - Damn, you're boring! What's your name? Laura? Why don't you just go home? Fuck, you're boring. Whoa-whoa, Laura... Hi! Hi. - Want some? - What is it? - Absinth. - No, thanks. Do you want some? Go on. It's awesome. It makes you really drunk. I got it from someone on the train. Let's dance! Laura... are you okay? - Yeah... - Shall I get you some water? Laura? Have you talked to the girl from the party? No. She's kinda... different. You probably just need to get to know her. Don't you think? She just seems to crave attention. You don't know her well enough to say that. Isn't it okay for me to think she craves attention? Sure, but it's an odd thing to say when you don't know her. So, I don't know her, but I still think she craves attention. Yeah, but maybe you just have to get to know her, I mean really know her. We talk about people we don't know all the time! So why do you suddenly react like this? You usually don't. What was that? It's Jonas. What the hell is he doing? Hey! What the hell are you doing here? Why do you care? Why are you throwing stuff out the window? I'm cleaning up. - Cleaning up? - I live here. - Want some? - No, thanks. - Are you drunk? - Yeah. What a damn loser. Laura! - Laura? Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - It was a great party. - So, what's up? - Not much. - Wanna come to the cafeteria? - Sure. - Yes. - Come. I put my hand down his pants. - And you know what? - What? - It was a girl. - Oh, my God! What did you do? We just kept at it. - That's so weird! - Insane. - Have you never been with a girl? - No. - And you? - No. - Have you never kissed each other? - No. Why would we? - Don't you ever want to? - Why would you kiss a girlfriend? Uhm... you've been with boys, right? Sure... a little. Are you a virgin? Yes. Are you a virgin, too? - No wonder you don't understand. - Understand what? Why you would want to be with a girl. Even if I haven't been with a boy I can still say that I don't want to be with a girl. Sure you can, but that's just because you don't understand. You're so far out. That doesn't have a damn thing to do with it. Why the hell are you looking at me like that? - Like what? - Seriously patronizing! - Take it easy... - Get a grip, Laura! Look at her! It's not funny! - Why are you on her side? - Relax, will you? - You're over-reacting. - Fuck you! What the fuck are you doing? She's totally pathetic. What's her problem? You can leave your stuff here. Tell me when to stop, okay? That's fine. I like a thick spread. - I like it like that. - Me, too. - Do you want more? - No, that's okay. - I'm covered in it. - I'll get it. - Let's go to my room. - Is it gone? Come. Wow. Great place. Thanks. Here. - What are they doing? - Don't know. It's weird. Kinda wild. - Is that the kind of music you like? - It's pretty nice. I hate this song. I'll find something else. I'll show you something. I've lived... right there. - Awesome. With whom? - My dad. - You've never been to New York? - No, unfortunately. What's it like? It's big! - For how long were you there? - About 6 months. - That long? - Yeah. It was great. Where was your mother? In Switzerland. But she visited a lot. - So how often do you see her? - It varies. - I'd love to live in New York. - Yeah. It's an awesome city. - But you should go to Berlin instead. - Why? It's a much cooler place. - Cooler than New York? - Well, I think it is. You haven't travelled much, have you? No. I mean, I've been to Spain a couple of times. - You can come to Berlin with me. - I'd like that. You've got lint all over your pantyhose. Listen to this. Listen to what? When you do like this it sounds like a tiny guitar. - Are you hungry? - A little. Let's get takeout. Aren't you eating with your parents? No. - They're not home. - So, I can eat here? Of course you can eat here, Laura. I always feel like throwing up when I eat this much. Me too. I have to make a call. - Who is it? - My dad. - Hi. - Hi, sweetie. Where are you? - I'm at a friend's house. - A girl from your class? - No. A girl called Maria. - Okay. Shall I pick you up? No, that's fine. I'll get home on my own. Raspberry Road 26. Yes. - What did he say? - He's picking me up. - When? - In 20 minutes. - Why? - I don't know. It sucks. - But you can walk home. - Yes. I don't know why. - Ridiculous. - Yeah. I haven't seen that girl before. - No, she's new in school. - I see. She's really nice. - What have you been up to? - We went to her place after school. And... we just hung out. - We didn't do much. - Okay. What are her parents like? Did you meet them? No. They weren't home. Here. Careful, it's hot. Is something wrong? - Are you okay, sweetie? - Yes. Come here. Do you have a fever? No. You're probably just tired. - Let's do something tomorrow. - Sure. We could drive into the city and visit Tivoli. - The first Tivoli trip of the year. - I have tons of homework. Like what? I have this big paper to write and other stuff. - I'll have to do it tomorrow. - Okay. - I think I'll go to bed. - Now? - Yes. May I be excused? - Yes, of course, sweetie. Sweet dreams. Seriously! Don't join a tap dance class. - It's just... - It's really cool. - Seriously nice. - Seriously embarrassing. - Hi. - Hi. So? What are you talking about? - Tap dancing. - Shut up! We're not talking about anything in particular. See you later. I'm off. - Bye. - Bye. Okay... - That was weird. - Yeah... - I have to go, too. - Now? Yes. But, uhm... see you later, okay? Or tomorrow. - Can't we walk together... - I'll text you. We made it. Who was it? No one important. - Are you starving, too? - Yes. - I know this great place. - Where? I'm not telling you. - Hi. - Hi, Maria! - This is Laura from school. - Hi. - Let's go. - Yeah. - Have you been here before? - Yes, I come here a lot. - Nice place, right? - Yes. - Do you go to Copenhagen often? - No. Why not? It just seems like too much of a hassle. - What did you do over the weekend? - Nothing. I was at the cottage. Alone? - With my parents. - Do you like your parents? - Yeah. - Why? Because... I don't know. You're actually kind of boring, aren't you? But you have pretty eyes. - Hello? - Hi. It's me. - Hi. - Where are you? On the train. I just wanted to hear where you'd been. I stopped by my grandmother. - You didn't tell me that. - No, but... No. - Hang on, I have to use the restroom. - Hurry up, okay? - Where's Laura? - In the restroom. Do you need to talk to her? Yes. Why? Did she do something to you or...? I just have to talk to her. Bye-bye, Christine. Laura, she left. - Wait! I need to talk to you. - I don't have time right now. I'll walk with you. Laura, listen! Laura, why don't you answer me? Laura, damn it, listen to me! - Laura... - Shut up! Shut up! Okay? You text me. You call me. Whenever I walk out a door, there you are! It's driving me insane! I just miss you. We've been best friends all our lives, and now you won't talk to me. Listen to what I'm saying and get it through your head! I'm serious, okay? I don't want to anymore! What have I done? - What's up with you... - Don't touch me! Don't... Don't! You just don't get it. - Okay. - I'll hurry. - I'll just eat and be right over. - Do you have to eat, Laura? - Just hurry on over, okay? - Can I bring something? No. Just hurry. Come here. Come. Now! - Now! - Okay. See you. Bye-bye. - Hi. - Hi, Laura. - Is that what you're wearing? - No, no. I'm taking this off. - You can't go out in that, Laura. - I can't? No place will let you in looking like that. - We'll find something else. - Is all this yours? - No, it's my mom's. - Nice! - This one! - Wow, it's beautiful. - Oh, my God. - Look. Like this. And there. - Okay, pull it up, but like this. - Okay. You just need to get laid. Find someone who can fuck you! You need a guy to fuck you, Laura! - You want to be fucked, right? - Yes. Right? You have to be fucked, damn it! Drink something, go on! 1, 2, 3... go on! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... Don't stop! No, no! Give it to me. Hey, could you keep it down? You act like little whores. Shut up and butt out! Piss off if you can't take it! Listen to this. This is our stop. Come. They look so old. I've been here tons of times. We'll get in. - This place is rocking. - Later on it'll get crazy wild! - When were you here last? - Right before I moved. - Hi. - Hi. That's Mads. - Mads. I apologize. - Tobias. May I buy you a drink? - What can I get you? - Just order something good. And for you, too. I'll go get something. Cool. Do you come here often? Uhm... this is my first time. - Cool place. - Yeah. - Party's over. - We can go to my place. Sure. Laura? We have beer. - Yeah... Sure, let's do that. - The party continues! Yeah! The party doesn't stop here. How about like this? The good old moves. Shit. Hey! Lovebirds! Drinks are waiting. Stop... Stop. Tobias, come on. - What? - Come. - Come on. - What the hell? - Kiss. - No! - I'm not kissing him. - Come on! Kiss him. Okay, we'll kiss, if you kiss afterwards. Come on, Mads. Here comes the best part. Stop. Stop! - My best homie! - Wow, man! Damn, he's a good kisser. Your turn. That's why we did it. Double up! Now. Come on. We're switching places. You come up here, we sit down. If you pay for a cab for us, we'll blow you. - What? - We'll blow you. - We'll give you a blowjob. - No... - Yes, Laura. - 500? There! Where do you want us? - Sit down. - Come. - You want us next to each other? - Come here. Thanks for the cash, boys! Fuck! We're not doing it. Let's find the train station. No, Maria, don't sit down. Don't go to sleep! Laura, take this. I'll just lose it. - Party time! - Laura, lie down. No, it's party time! Sweetie... Mom. Maybe you should stop seeing so much of Laura. She doesn't treat you very well. - Don't say that about her. - She's making you sad. I don't want to talk to you about it! - Then who will you talk to? - I won't talk to anyone! And I won't talk to you about it! I'm sleeping! Leave me alone! I don't want to talk about Laura now! Please leave! Yes. How about inviting Ellen and Lasse over for dinner? - Good idea. - Why not invite them up to the cottage? - I'll give them a call. - Great. - Christine probably isn't coming. - But she told me she'd love to. - When did she say that? - The other day. Oh... well, she can't. I don't know why. I'll sleep over at her place tonight, if that's okay? - Sure. - Thanks for dinner. You're welcome. May I come in? Tell me... what's up with Christine? - I don't know. - Why doesn't she want to come? I think she's having a tough time. Okay. Do you talk to her about it? Sometimes. How about if you and Christine stayed home next weekend. You could hang out, just the two of you. That would be great. Okay, off you go. Say hi from us. - Hi, Laura! - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I just wanted to say hi. Hi. I'm Sofie. Hi, Laura. - Will you roast this? - Yeah. - Shall I roast it? - Yes, please. Good morning. Good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Mmm. Where's Sofie? Sofie who? She left already. Laura? Come in here, please. We need to talk to you. What? Where have you been? I've just been... out. Laura, we know you weren't at Christine's. What's going on? - Nothing... - I called you a million times. Why don't you answer the phone? - Laura! - Yes? You can't just come and go as you please! You must tell us where you are! Laura! Where the hell have you been? - None of your damn business! - We're worried about you! - Laura, you're coming to the cottage. - No. You're coming with us to the cottage, do you hear me? - You said I could stay home. - Too late. Give me your phone. - I'm not coming to the cottage. - Give me your phone. - No. - Give me the phone. Now. - Give me your phone! - I'm not coming to the cottage! - Give it to me! - Let me turn it off. - No! Go to bed! - You said I could stay home! - To bed! - I've made plans! You brought this on yourself! Fuck you! I hate you! Two in the home square already. Not bad. Your turn. Don't. - Okay, so you can... - A four. Shall we do something else? Go for a walk, perhaps? Laura, is this how it's going to be all weekend? Hi, sweetie. Mom's still sleeping. I'M SORRY. HELD CAPTIVE AT THE COTTAGE. I LOVE YOU!!! - Morning, sweetie. - Hi! Where have you been? - I went for a walk. - We just talked about the same thing. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Hi, Laura! I've missed you like crazy. Don't ever leave me again. Come. - Isn't it nice? - Yes! - Hello! - Hello! - Laura! - Maria! Why does it say 'Laura' on the walls? Did you write that? - No. - That's so cute! Hey! What are you doing here? Hanging out. Do you know who wrote that? It was you, wasn't it? No. Why are you lying? - None of your damn business. - Just tell her you're hot for her. - Come on, don't... - But it's true. I totally understand why. She's cute. And beautiful. She's really soft. Feel. You're messed up. You know you want to. He wants to, Laura! Take off your clothes, and then you can fuck her. It's okay. Damn, you're messed up. Fuck, what a pushover. Laura, wait! - I don't wanna do it anymore. - Come on, it'll look great. She's always by herself. Are you looking forward to tonight? I'm nervous. They must be pissed off after what we did to them. - How can they want to see us again? - They thought it was fun. No, they didn't. They were really pissed off. No. All they want is to score us. That's all they care about. Score us? Yeah, what did you think? I don't know. - Are you afraid to? - No. There's nothing to worry about. Why not just get it over with? What if he expects me to know all sorts of stuff? He probably does. - No. - Why not? - He knows you're a virgin. - How can he know that? - Because I told him. - You told him? - I told him to be gentle. - How embarrassing! - No, it isn't! - Yes! It's totally embarrassing. No, it isn't! No! This really sucks. So embarrassing. Cheers. Hi. Hey. - Are you painting over everything? - Yeah. What are you doing? Yeah, we're on the bridge. Okay. Are you ready? - Yeah, I think so. - It'll be fun. - Hi there! - Hey. Good to see you. Hi, Laura. - I could use a refill. - Me too. You too? That went fast. Cheers. In a second he'll kiss her ear. Wanna bet? Shall we go downstairs? Yeah. We're going downstairs. See you. Okay. Downstairs they go. Come. - Where are we going? - Come on. Hey... You don't have to, if you don't feel like it. Get off me! Get off me, damn it! - Take it easy. - Go away! - Get off me! - Calm down! - Go away! - What's going on? - Go away! Get out! - You get out! - Okay, get out for a second. - I didn't do... - Out. You, too. Both of you. - 500 for me fucking her. And 500 for you two. Get it through your skull! Calm down, Maria. Sit up. Come on. Sit up. - I can't... - Easy, easy. - What am I gonna do, Laura? - Don't push me. What am I gonna do? Don't touch me! No one touches me! Are you stupid? We tricked you, Laura! I asked them to do it! I told them to fuck us! You're so stupid! - Did you arrange this with them? - Yes! Please don't be mad at me. I did it for you, Laura. You're not a very good friend. - Laura... - No. Just go. Go! I can give you a ride home, if you want. - Let's go back to my place together. - Go! - Laura! - Stop it. Just go. - Are you coming? - No. - Hello? - Hi, dad. Laura? Could you come get me? - Sure, of course. Where? - Rungsted Harbour. Good morning. Did you... do drugs of any kind? - No. - No... What about the boys. They didn't grab you or kiss you or...? No. Not really. Laura, we'd love to help you. You can tell us what happened, if you feel like it. This Maria girl... What's she like? Is she a fun girl or...? Nice? Silly? What's she like? - Are you tired, sweetie? - Yes. Sweetie... - You need a good sleep. - Yes. We can talk more later. Okay? Maria's on the phone. She called many times. Want to talk to her? - Yes. - Here. What do you want? Can't you come over? Can't you come over, so we can talk about it and be friends again? No, I can't. Laura, you're my best friend. I've never had a friend like you before. Hello? Laura? - I'm hanging up. - No! Don't hang up! Laura, don't hang up! Hey... Hi. Can we talk? Do you really think I want to talk to you? I'm sorry. Christine... - Just... - Get lost. Christine... Fuck off! - Hi. - Hi. Can I come in? Did you get home all right... last time? Oh... yeah. It was fine. Don't stop... I'm sorry. What do you mean? - I don't know. - It's okay. I need to go to the bathroom. Laura? Laura! Shit! Subtitles: Tina Goldberg Dansk Video Tekst
