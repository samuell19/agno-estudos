Are you gonna chew my brains? I may have to leave Hey... Sorry Maha, I held there by mistake. Is it so painful? Not at all... Its soothing. Is this why you stopped me? I am leaving... Maha, how many times should I ask you? Tell me who stabbed you. Why do you want to know? Someone has made an attempt on your life. Shouldn't I know who it was? Tell me before you leave You know, the municipal head of Narapakkam, Mr Muthuraj Ya, I know him. The miser who exploits you for his sake and defers the payments... Hey, have some respect while talking. Somehow he pays off, right Still he doesn't settle the payment, with holds some money That's how it works. He uses this tactic to work for him whenever needed. Come to the matter. Even before he could enter politics, he was doing real estate business. His competitor was Surya Narayanan. They had a stiff competition The were aggressively competing over finding plots for upcoming factories in Sriperumbudur. Muthuraj meddled with three big deals of Surya Narayanan and bagged it. All of them are big ones with crores of commission. Surya Narayana got wild and wanted to kill Muthuraj But the hit men goofed up and killed the driver instead. Driver was related to Muthuraj's wife. Than him she got very furious And that's when I was called upon to kill Surya Narayanan. I made the plan Flawless sketch. Just 3 boys... Killed Surya Narayanan in single attempt The deceased Surya Narayanan has two brothers. Guru Narayanan and Aadhi Narayanan. Adhi Narayanan is the one who attempted to finish me Even then, why did they come for you directly without hurting the ones responsible? They didn't come to me straight away... Actually, there was a hearsay that the two brothers vowed on Surya Narayanan's corpse that they would take revenge of all those responsible for his death Post that Muthuraj had to Travel in his car with His hit men along and Vehicle full of weapons while perusing as to what to do, thought out clearly decided to join a party in align with his ideologies, and entered the current party he is in. In our country, politics is the safest refuge for those with heaps of unscrupulous money Eventhough Muthuraj found himself safe in political sway, to clutch him in persistent fear, Narayanan brothers spent Huge money to murder all The three assassins who Killed his bro in public You mean, all three of them? You claim, your involvement is known only to those concerned How did they sense it? To save his head, would Muthuraj have betrayed you? Viji, than me, Muthuraj Is keen in protecting my Identity about my role in All his underground dealings How did they come to know? One among the three assassins of Narayanan was killed on the streets Of the rest two, one surrendered himself in police station Before he could be taken to the Court, he hanged himself in police station and was dumped in GH mortuary The third fellow absconded 6 months ago was found after 4 days with his head burnt in a bush near Wallajahbad Unable to withstand the torture of Narayanan brothers, In stitching pain, before dying, he must have revealed my name Poor fellow! I am scared, Maha That's why I am reluctant to share about my job Why do have to do such a job which you can't disclose your wife? Hey, I told you I would gradually come out of it Why to talk about it repeatedly? You ward them off soon Let's get far away from those looking for you Its ok to starve but need peace of mind Dressed in colourful attire, hold hands although the market place let's rejoice and roam around, without fear and worries Let leave this place sooner, Maha Got to have money, Viji Daddy... Did you bring the mobile gadget? Yes,Its all there. This is dad's bag. Tell mom to keep it safe. I know its foreign bottle Ya,ya, James bond. Keep the bottle safely without breaking it.

I was in one of the champs...you know! Terrible hunger was the best teacher! Which jail, bro? Whose cremation, man? It's been burning for quite sometime Some love failure case... Chitragupthan closed his account yesterday. You are spared for some reason Chitragupthan's job is not about that... His job is not issuing death penalty Since birth till death, the journey of ones life decides, if their posterity would shoulder the good and evil of the deceased. The heirs would shoulder the good or evil is the judgment From which side did Narayanan stab you? I aimed at his neck... From the side, while I tried to cut, he swiftly turned The knife got stuck in his shoulder Otherwise... Hey, calm down. Don't you know the difference between neck and the shoulder? Don't blabber... Calm down Municipal head Muthuraj gets all his work done by Mahadevan... You too know that. There are lots of cases against him in your Dept too... Do one thing, you find him and encounter, We shall sponsor you Guru Narayanan, You called me to discuss something... urgently but now you want me to do a encounter urgently Money can work things only to some extent.

Let's see who wins! [Murmurs a musical tune] You say we need to think ahead of our enemies. They have stabbed you Please draft a sketch and arrange money to finish the brothers We kill them both To spy on them would require men so would be expensive My present position is not favourable Find a hideout for a while Till we get money... Shall await ripe time Ya, Gopal... I ate already while you called.

Dispatching him just requires 2 bikes and 4 guys But to abduct, need 2 men to spy him, 4 men to kidnap and the vehicle payment. This won't meet the expenses Take 2 of my guys who work in a garage. Work shop guys As you said, if you want any vehicle they will bring it from the customer See two of your guys off and loop them in They will bring the vehicle You can save the vehicle rent [Grunts] Can't gel with new guys I know them too well...

They don't bother even if you abuse Just throw some peanuts They would vote like monkeys You must not earn a ill name in the party, Understand? Have it Even if you fart inside water, an able politician knows to suppress it Who is Sekkizhaar? Who wrote Kamba Ramayana are immaterial to us. Its just enough to know to tally the accounts of the commission received. Don't spoil your name If reputation is lost, recommendation will not work inside the party, understand? Why have you not finished it... Have it Its ok... You might get MLA seat. If you let him talk now, your repute sinks. How did you spare him? He is not spared...

That's why took your pic [Smiles] You know Ilavarasan farm house? Everyday you reach your home by it. But you might not have noticed me Because right from 6th class I was in hostel Other day, I brought a boy to the tuition, Ilavarasan... His dad Jayaraman is my dad too... But I don't like him at all May I know about you? Did not like to work under someone Just me and mom here. I love my mom In this 70 cent land, we do farming. Thankfully not starving. In the evenings, taking tuitions in Maniyarasan sir's tuition centre Weekends, I go to Mekkarai. One of the places without school Give them books to read and screen movies. I am influenced by Vivekananda. Practising bachelorhood like him Is it? You asked for coffee, dear Will you not offer me coffee? Muni, Please go buys a new glass Why? There it is... Pour in this Careful, its hot! Are you doing organic farming? Yes Chemicals and pesticides were promoted to increase yield But organic fertilizers doesn't yield much, right? For the worms and birds, not to eat the crops, we used fertilizers and we were eating it But in organic farming, its 30%-70% share between us and the worms and birds Missed to ask, do you have Charu's books Rasaleela and Kalagamkaadhal Isai? Uncle, can I please take the ball? Yes, I have. It doesn't matter she rejected you, Pal But its awful she rejected you for him. What man, are you sure? Seeing her bike near his house, I made a boy pretend taking the ball and asked to spy them He clearly says they were having coffee together What cup was she using? Disposable? No...eversilver cup Thought she insulted our family, but now she is a shame to our clan The bugger just has a tiny piece of land, but... Gonna deliver the report...Hope there are enough cops for security There are enough Cops Hey, Our Thirumoorthy bro is no more, and you are running your business In our Kanchipuram district, murders for party and real estate are usual. If he was killed on the streets, it would just have been yet another case But, he was abducted, tortured, skull was broken and then dumped in water. Well planned and executed. Too much pressure from superiors So, party men won't rest till they find the assassin and encounter So, Find out who did this, for whom? and who plotted it and bring them all Ok? Gopal, you must have called me Gopal. You did a blunder. See its exposed the next day. Does bro who about this? My boys are demanding money. News is out already. Will they not mistake me now? Its not well thought off at all... can I meet him now? Can I meet Bro now? Uncle is not here... He has gone out. I need money now. I wanna meet him. You wait, I shall tell you once he comes back You will get your dues Why is he pestering? Demanding all the pending dues Why does he want full settlement? Is he planning to move out of town? There's still pending work... what's the hurry? Going by chief's words, got into trouble now Let everything get sorted. You don't release his payment. Shall see later. Ok uncle Look at these fellows, they eye the wealth and the girl...somehow mesmerise Be it family or social issues, people come to you But if you lose you dignity, that's what I am worried about That's what I am worried about You need to keep this in mind too... Nowadays, if someone is found dead on the railway track its perceived to be a honor killing. So got to be vigilant and adopt other methods So, we got to be vigilant and adopt some other method 'Intermission' You have used this library very effectively. Have not seen anyone else doing so. Good... You have even completed your studies using this? Such a profound explanation for Thiruakkural! Failing to accept him to be an average man or a patient But why is your report so confusing? I couldn't interpret why Take a look now, focus is perfect Take a closer shot of the idol Hello Muniraj, Hey, Come...come He is the one I was talking about Is it? Hi. Are you the one? Heard about you Come on, Is this your project too? Yes Writing an article in the topic "Where is your God?" Collecting materials for it Ok... Do you disclose the presence of God in it? In the end I say, the biggest make-believe lie is God With holy marks on forehead and Om dollar What's your idea about God? Understanding of God varies between people Shall tell you my perception, try deciphering While we were still animals food and reproduction were the only needs. Out of the lot, few beasts began contemplating. Such were termed humans, in due course Greed, jealousy, rivalry and vengeance developed, which their ancestors did not possess. Thus humans lost their peace of mind! To analyse why, in serenity, temples were built Those apprehended, shed the undesirable qualities and attained wisdom Ones who attained such state of mind, bestowed us with Thirumandhiram, Thirukkural, Bhagavatgeetha... ...Quran, Thammapatham, Bible and the like Those who comprehend them in their true sense, could attain peace If you train yourself everyday like Bruce Lee, you can become one Instead if you just worship his picture, you will never get there Could hear the voice of a peacock, we shall go click pictures. You guys go ahead, see you Have been busy lately, got to shoot a program tonight If free, why don't you join us? No, got to go to Mekkarai. Kids will be waiting Fine, see you then Hey! Get lost!

He won't come in our way from now - Please start - Hold on, let him come Can't travel with him. Drop us and then pick him Based on occupation, caste was devised. Can there be a inferior and a superior job? Honesty towards one's job alone matters Society pays homage to the soldier guarding our borders but turns a blind eye towards sewer deaths Aren't both lives equal? Ok bro Ok Bro Ok boss Dear, Dear, Sir is asking you to come home There is still more to shoot No, dear Its late already. Please come soon.

Apart from that, 50 metres from where the corpse was found Outside a shop, a passing by auto is recorded The auto was found in your brother-in-law's friend's garage So a small enquiry is warranted in this regard Bro, Instead of shelling out money to solve the case, denounce the assassin and retreat The one arrested You needn't worry about his release at all. We won't let him out alive We shall sort out the rest Is Maha still with you? Tell me sir. What man, its your fortune that Maha's case Has come back to our department I have instructions to submit him alive If he gets arrested, he wouldn't spare any of you Narayana, think it over Its Devaraj Its about that fellow Maha He is gonna be arrested in Thirumoorthy's case If he gets arrested...

Cow got inside. I warned the owner, he didn't listen. So had to lock Why can't you just keep it latched? Tender coconut always lies in open. Why did you keep it in sack? Do not suspect everything...
