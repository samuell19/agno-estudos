I'll talk to him. -Do you speak English? -Not a word. -Thanks. -Yes. Good night. Thanks. -Isn't this nice? -Wonderful. Beautiful flowers, for a beautiful girl? Thanks. The two of us... -Let's get some fresh air. -OK. -Wonderful. -Yes, isn't it magnique? Ma-gni-fi-que. Ma-gni-fi-que. The lights look just like diamonds. -I don't understand. -You don't understand diamonds? They're little things that sparkle and that make ladies so happy. They look like this. Married? No, no. My mère gave me this ring. -Your "mère"? -Yes, my mère. -Oh, you have a baby? -No, I don't have a baby. My mother gave me this ring. It's wonderful how well we understand each other. I dance, like this. Yes, like that. Yes. Who's the big star? Ah, you like Paris. You like Paris. I need to learn English. I can't understand a word. What is it? Where is he taking me? What's going on? OK, I get it! Who is this moron? Waking people up with his nonsense! What did he say? He says you made him love France. I couldn't care less. I'm Dutch. Is this it? Good night, then. Ah, you're leaving. I see. Good bye. -Wonderful. -What about you? Bob? Bob Wellington. I'll never remember that. Thanks. Good bye. No, the metro's open. It's five o'clock. The sun's coming up. Good bye. Love, always love. My dear son, we can't give your friend Bob a chance on our stage. As you know, we take on well-known stars only. But I could hire him as a cashier and as the great Ziegfield used to say, "Stars pass by, cashiers remain." I am, you are, he is, she is Speaking French is easy! Good evening, good day Always love That's all Thanks a lot When I wish for something And I can't find the words to say I say, Mademoiselle It's like this, it's like that And everyone understands Why speak French, English? The sun is shining up above OK, that's great, like that Cause I'm so in love Yes, I'm in love Love is always love -B sharp or B flat? -Flat! Thank you! Love is always love Always and yet forever Always love Love No, no, no. This isn't for me. This is a song for a man, isn't it? Which idiot wrote this? I did. -You're happy to be back in work. -You bet. You speak much better now. I told you, I was born in Texas, but my father was from Belleville. -Which street? -Rue de Belleville. Oh, that's nice. -And your friends? -They're back in America. No more playing soldiers in Frankfurt. I'm back to the serious stuff. -Ah. "Pépé's Pipe." -What's that? It's not one of mine. Mambo. Let's do it. Pépé's pipe, Pépé's pipe Papa's! Pépé's pipe, Papa's pipe Panpan's papou -It's too intellectual. -Yes, it's a bit abstract. "The Guitarist." That's a monument. Sing that and you feel a lift under your feet. -Your what? -Your feet. The guitarist has assassin's hands That's one for me. The guitarist has assassin's hands They feel so soft When he holds me in his arms -I am. -You are. -You are. -I am. -She is. -She is. -Me? -She is. It is. -Who? -It is. It is. It is. Be nice. We can't talk without you. OK, carry on. Tell him it's strange but true. -Beaujolais? -Go ahead. I already loved Bob when I was a kid. Impossible. I need to explain. I found girls' magazines boring. I read the boys' stuff. Superman, Brave Hearts, Intrepid, stories with lots of fights. They scared me, but I liked that. Wait a minute. Iron-Arm Luke was my favorite. He was amazing. He could kill a guy with a look. And that Iron-Arm Luke, my idol, was just like Bob. He looks just like him. Wait a minute. I spent my whole childhood watching Bob killing bandits, rescuing young girls and breaking pumas over his knee. My love for him dates way back. Wait! Carry on. Translate. All that? We'd still be here tomorrow. Well... "She loves you"? It was more than that. I summarized. She loves you. "I feel so small in your arms. "Your hand in my hand. What joy. Everything is well, Marquise." Yawn. Sleep. Good bye, I'm going to bed. You're my lucky charm. You go to my head like champagne. I'm so happy, I could walk on the ceiling. Other people's sweet-talk can sound so stupid. Soon, he'll be telling me himself. He's going to start work in Montmartre's cabarets. He'll learn French fast. You don't need a translator for this. He'll learn French fast, while he's singing in cabarets. Give me a scotch. Hi, Bob. I hear your Brazilian joint isn't doing so well. It's all over. They're opening a bakery. What a crummy joint. If my life was starting again If my past became the future If I had to choose The same destiny, the same path Never, knowing what I know Would I relive those bad memories If I had to choose I'd never start life Over again I love everything about life I'm the most relaxed of men My only desire Is to enjoy life as much as I can I like winter and summer alike I'm easy to satisfy But I don't like it When people tread on my... Here's the print. No, that's too red. It's not the storming of the Bastille. Give me a more frivolous pink. You know what I mean? What are you waiting for? I say that feet Were made for dancing To move with a girl When she's in full swing For strolling down the street Or running to the betting shop There's no reason to tread on mine And as such, I see no reason why This foot here should suddenly... -What's that? -Lucrezia Borgia's costume. -Is that it? -Yes. Not bad. Very good. OK, I'm listening. And as such, I see no reason why This foot here should suddenly... Madame Huguette! This isn't enough. Put some feathers in her hair. -OK. -Off you go. I love everything about life I'm the calmest of... Young man! Wait, that's the boss. This is a good sign. Go! Young man! Young man! Young man! Come to my office to sign a contract. What's your name? Worthington? That's very nice, but find a French name. They're easier to remember. How about that? You see. Wonderful, Bob! They said to change your name. Dupont? Durand? -Dubois? -Du Shnock! Isn't that nice? Hardy, with a 'y'. Doesn't that have a ring? Bob Hardy. Not bad. Not bad at all. Bob Hardy! And now "The Grape Harvest in the Village." In the last fine days All the lovers Are out among the vines With a glad heart Picking the golden grapes One by one And stealing kisses The sun is always aged 20 The mellow wine Goes to the lovers' heads And far from the houses The boys and girls Sing the same songs It's so nice to dance In the scented air In the light, country breeze Enjoying the wine of love And the last fine days -Did you see me? -Yes, I did. That was nothing. The next number is "Winter Sports." It'll be great. I think you're better than this. Well, I'm really happy. We're working together. That's the main thing. You'll see, one day, you'll get a big number yourself. I'm sure of it. ...rises to the lovers' heads And far from the houses The boys and girls Sing the same songs It's so nice to dance In the scented air Mr. Roger! I need to have a word. One won't be enough. -How are you, Claudie? -Fine, thanks. -Are you on good form? -Yes, why? Barbara didn't come. I knew it, from the first time I saw her. Who can play her part? -You're sure she's not here? -Yes. I called and her mother said she was off for the weekend. What can we do? Claudie. -Can Claudie do it? -For sure. -Claudie! -Yes? Come on. Come on! Come on. -Can you cover Barbara? -Yes! I No. I mean I don't know. Hey, dresser! Get her ready. Winter sports! It's so much fun to slide Winter sports! On the icy slopes Amid that white dream Men are like children But when the evening comes We'll meet up at the bar With the dancing tanned ladies Winter sports! It's so nice by the fire Winter sports! Especially with a friend The white village Sleeps under the silver sky People's hearts are drunk On sun and joy Love reigns free! That went well. So, do I keep the part? -We'll see, we'll see. -Yes, we'll see. Isn't that great for her? It's nothing, compared to what's coming. -What? -Roland's sofa.

Is that you, my love? "My darling, my love"? No, Mademoiselle, he's singing. Small, large or medium I respect my neighbors' So there's no reason To tread on my mine So there's no reason To tread on mine Yes, is that applause for him? Roger! Roger, listen!

Claudie? -Is your name Claudie? -Yes, sir. I can't allow that. -You're not entitled to it. -OK, sir. Go on, scram. There's only one Claudie. I remember the first evening. Paris was asleep but her eyes sparkled with every light on the Champs-Élysées. It was wonderful. Ah, Claudie... Claudie... is right here. And I'm... over here. Further. Everything I love is far away. Paris Bohemian Paris To whom do you say I love you? To the wealthy, to crooks Or to ghosts? What price, your smile? What price For such luck to begin? But one day, Paris In the sixth arrondissement Who knows You will tell me Do you see this city Awakening below? Now, you may take your chance In your arms Because you love her She is yours Good evening, Claudie. I'm far away, but I'm thinking of you. Goodnight, baby. Nothing for us? -Not yet, but I'm thinking of you. -The Casino girls are working. Everyone on stage, fast. You're quite charming. -Excuse me, Mr. Loiselet. -OK, OK. -It's mean to keep me from working. -It's coming. Here, the key. She's gorgeous. Who is she? Just a little dancer. Would she eat with me, if I invited her? -Definitely not, she's married. -To whom? -A singer, who's on tour. -So he's never here. Nothing doing. She only thinks about work. Really? Call her over. -Claudie! -Yes? -Nice legs. -From the front, yes. Mr. Philippe Loiselet. -Hello. -I'm interested in you. -Do you have any photos? -Yes. I'd like to see them. Call me, at my office, as soon as you can. Thanks. Good luck. We're on soon. -What does that guy do? -Movies. I'm a diamond eater Diamonds are my food They suit my nature I like their feel, between my teeth Their sparkle Drives me out of my mind I don't hold back for a second I pounce on my prey I'm a diamond eater An elegant duchess Known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain Cousin of a princess With kings as her cousins Was given the biggest diamonds By a prince from Annam They covered her hands and fingers She didn't know what to do with them But as for me... I'm a diamond eater I can't manage without that vitamin Without diamonds, my health suffers I like their feel, between my teeth To retain my iron constitution I don't hold back for a second I know what to do with those carats I'm a diamond eater Their sparkle Drives me out of my mind I don't hold back for a second I pounce on my prey I'm a diamond eater You said you'd call. I had rehearsals every day. -Here are the photos. -Thanks. I have a charming part for you, an elegant little lady from Paris. We'll choose the finest dresses. She lives in the most luxurious surroundings. She has beautiful jewelry. I've never been on camera. So much the better. You'll be more spontaneous. Will I have to talk? Oh, very little. You know in the language of moving images, nothing is purely substantive. The image becomes word. And words become images. -Do you see what I mean? -Yes, of course. To your success. So, is this where you live? -Yes, in the sixth. -Paris is at your feet. And quite right, too. Be good. Ah, I was forgetting! I need to make an urgent telephone call. And everything's closed now. Could I call from your place? If you like. -Good evening, Madame Claudie. -Good evening, Gaston. -The telephone is there. -Ah, is it? Perfect. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Madame Claudie! -Yes? There's a letter from Mr. Bob, with a nice stamp from Alexandria. -I'll keep it for you. -Thanks. It's 22 minutes and 30 seconds past 3 o'clock. It's 22 minutes and 30 seconds past 3 o'clock. Not that. Not that. Not that. Not that. There they are! The world's most beautiful diamonds. Diamond stockings, to make your legs sing. Available in all good stores. DIAMOND STOCKINGS Hôtel Bosquets, Rue Caulaincourt. Oh, Mr. Bob! What a surprise. -How are you, Gaston? -Good. You? That's not my key. It is. You're in the balcony apartment now. -Madame Claude changed two weeks ago. -I see. -Is everything OK? -Just fine, Mr. Bob. FOR CLAUDIE FROM HER FRIEND PHILIPPE DIAMOND STOCKINGS Bob, my darling! My darling, I'm so happy. -Who's that? -Mr. Philippe Loiselet. Loiselet Advertising. Haven't you heard of it? You know, the posters in the subway. In the programs. You know them. Why didn't you call? I'd have come to fetch you. I went out early this evening. You didn't write me that you'd changed rooms. I wanted to surprise you. Where did you get the money for a surprise? Mr. Loiselet liked me as soon as he saw me. The photos and Diamond stocking ads paid well. Right. I believe in myself now, thanks to him. So, he liked you. He understands artists so well. You'll see. Darling, you shouldn't have. It's beautiful. It's not much, compared to what your friend gave you. He didn't give me anything. I did an ad for the furriers' union and they gave me a discount. And are you making films for the florists' union? Bob, I can't stop him from sending me flowers. You've got all the answers. Tell me, why was he so awkward when he saw me? Why did he run off? It's because I walked in on you both. Oh, come on, I have to be nice to him. If you think I like going to bed at 2:30 a.m. when I've got a 7 a.m. shoot, you're wrong. And I was doing it for you, in a way. -For me? -Yes, for you. I don't want you to go away. I'm fed up with your crummy tours. -My crummy tours? -Yes, I mean... They're no worse than your bit parts. My crummy tours! I'm doing two numbers and a ballet in the next review. Thanks to Philippe? Or was that someone else? What can I tell you? You're jealous of my success, not of Philippe Loiselet. People are noticing my talent! You've got talent? Is this your talent? Your talent is a little too much on display. Go, Suzy! You're on! Move forward a bit. A bit more. Move your body. Lean backward. Good, that's nice. Move your leg now. Keep in time with the rhythm. Follow the music. That's perfect. Hey! -How are you? -On top form. I wanted to see Claudie. It's a bit awkward. We had a stupid argument. We need to cut this number! -Why? -Because it's really bad. Claudie's best number was cut, because it was too good. No, no, no, no, no! This is flabby! -What do you mean? -It's just flabby. It lacks... It lacks what I like. He can't hold me. But you're a great artist! Listen to me. We're only rehearsing. -He needs to rehearse. -He'll never learn! He looked as fine as Apollo to me. Apollo! That's good! He looked totally indifferent. This isn't the time. Claudie will get her part back. Take it easy, please. -You know me, Roger. -Exactly. You can achieve anything, with the soft touch. Help! Get this madman away from me! Help! Help! Help! He's going to kill me! Call the police! Get him out of my dressing room! He dared to threaten me! He's killed two of them! Send in more! This should be so easy. Go on! -Why don't you go? -Are you done yet? My jewels! He hit me! Help me up. That's the kind of support I need. He's the man! I need a real man, like that. If you were nicer to Philippe Loiselet, he could make us both stars at the Casino. You know, I'd never leave you on your own. But you keep pushing him away. I love Bob. I don't look at other men. You don't look at other men. That's friendship for you! He's a distinguished gentleman. -He must have nice bathrobes. -Claudie! And that's not an act. They really mean it. Claudie. I came to see you. I saw. -Let me explain. -You don't need to explain anything. I called you crummy. I was wrong. You're much cleverer than I thought. Here's the champion! The expert. Now that you've got the star - I mean the headline - don't forget your friends. Don't worry. A Martini. I've seen wimps and fools before, but you take the biscuit. I always knew you were a winner, Bob. -I really did. -Thanks. Shall we sit down? -You're free now. -No, I'm in a rush. You know, it'd be nice to have dinner at my place, one evening. Just the two of us. Would you like that? Are you seeing much of Claudie at the moment? -From time to time. -Does she ever mention me? You have delusions of grandeur. It's easy to recover from them. I'm coming. Get a move on. You look quite the dandy, with your carnation. It was Suzy's idea. A little secret. It means that between us... It's on. -And the carnation means... -Yes. You've... Come on. You'll like this. It'll hit him right in the face. He's my gigolo And when he takes me in his arms... So, did you see that? -Is something up? -Hang on a minute. I didn't say good bye. Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo... Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo... Bravo! I'm wild for unknown pleasures Life would be so fine for me One true love For my nights and my days I'm the woman of one true love You're marvelous. You know, when I sing that song, I feel as if I wrote it myself. -Suzy! -Yes, Gérard, what do you want? I have important news. I've just discovered two resonant rhymes. -These are millionaire rhymes. -But it's too late. I'm on stage in an hour. Ah, Bob. What's got into you, darling? -Get out, you clowns. -What? Have we met? Are you forgetting, I'm a star. I can have a bit of romance in my life. You can have a library-full, if you like. What's this about, if you're not jealous? Don't try to understand. I've been so stupid. "I get it," as you'd say. You regret leaving your dancer for a woman like me. How touching. Don't talk about her like that. Well, this evening, you're performing with me, not her. Won't she recognize you? No, she's only met me once. Do you recognize me? No. OK, I'm off. -What's my name? -Malkuski. With an 'i' or a 'y'? I'll love the stranger That can keep me for life I'm wild for unknown pleasures My life would be so beautiful One true love For my nights and my days I am a woman of one true love Bravo! You were wonderful. Thank you. Let me kiss you. Don't sulk. Not now. I'll see you on stage. Oh, leave me alone. Bob, this is ridiculous. The success of the review is all that counts. You have to understand that. I don't care about the review. I want to drop the whole thing. You're on soon. Come on, stop messing around. -Miss Morgan. -Yes? Malkuski? -He runs New York's best music hall! -Yes. He wants to see you, fast. I can't, I'm going on. You still have seven minutes. Have my dress prepared for the ballet with Bob and send Mr. Malkuski in. -How do I look? -Amazing. And your plane takes off in an hour. OK, OK. -Will you remember everything? -Don't worry about it. Mr. Malkuski. You're in a rush and so am I. My plane takes off in an hour. I need your signature. Ah, you're Russian. Vy govorite po russky? -Sorry? -Vy govorite po russky? -American. USA. -I see. I'll make you a big star in a show that I'm putting on next year. Next year? That's a long time away. Write to me. Claudie! Hurry up! Hurry up! -Put this dress on, fast. -What's going on? -She's in there. -But... Don't ask. You're the lead. I don't know. We need to discuss this. $6,000 a week. That's very nice, but I'm due on stage. $8,000. Mr. Malkuski, I'll miss my cue. Miss Morgan, you drive a hard bargain. $10,000. OK, I accept, now excuse me, I have to go. Just a minute. You need to sign the contract. What? There we go. Don't talk so loud. You need to sign each page and fill in the blank spaces with the fee that you so adroitly negotiated, which you deserve. But this is at least 20 pages. Twenty-seven. No star will ever have been paid so handsomely. Get a move on or you'll make me miss my flight. You're so American. Miss Morgan, this is quite incredible. I'm the happiest of men. I'm overwhelmed. I never dared hope for this much. Again, I lay my greatest respects at your feet. I may have missed my flight, but... The foxtrot is so wonderful And even the shimmy English steps, Scottish steps And all the rest It's the java, the old mazurka The old sebasto I'm your woman, I'm your girl And you're my man Hold me close Hold me tight in your arms I'll follow you I'll do whatever you like When you hold me I feel dizzy, in my heart I like your cap, your sideburns And your smokes Don't you think I've suffered enough? Tell me you believe me. -Claudie! -Yes? -I love you. -What? I love you. Paris! Queen of the world Paris! She's a blonde She has a button nose And a cheeky air Her eyes are always full of laughter The people that know you Leave, drunk on your caresses But they always come back for more Here's to your lovers, Paris!
