You want Wade to mix it? Dick: He's standing right there. -You think he's competent? -Deleaua: I think he's competent. -(laughter) -Dick: Anybody can mix it, I have to consume it. Okay. Without assistance. Okay. (sighs) So, you need to be over on the couch. -Yes, I do. -Okay. All right, folks. Deleaua: All right. Will: I'm gonna say this real quick. I just wanna thank you for everything. (chuckling) For the last 35 years of teaching and... and I want that to be the last thing I say, so I'm gonna walk over here, but... (chuckling) -And good luck. -Dick: Likewise. I love you all. (chuckling) -Deleaua: It's all right. -Thanks a lot, Will! -(laughter) -Deleaua: Right. -Deleaua: Was it grim? -No. -Not bitter? -It wasn't bad. Deleaua: Okay. -Dick: You'll do fine. -I will do fine. -Make sure you do. -I will. I will do fine. (sighs) It feels too early to lay down. Don't lay down. You can still sit here and tell jokes. -What if I fall down? -Oh, not a problem. -I'm the therapist. I know how to get you into bed. -(Dick laughs) Oh goodness. Dick: You all have been so good through this whole thing, and I regret the pain that it may cause you. Just know that I love you, each and every one of you. (sniffles) (sniffles) "Dearest Dick, "you and Deleaua have been on my mind and in my prayers daily. "I'm gonna be looking to the heavens as you take flight. Give my dad a hug if you run into him." Next one is, "I love you very, very much. "I have learned so much from you, "and consider your friendship a wonderful gift. I will miss your dry humor and unselfish spirit." (sniffles) (snorting) So, this is just part of the process. Not to worry. (gurgling) This is just breathing at the end of life. The body's just working hard here. (classical music playing) (snorts) Wade: Do you want time alone? I'm fine. He can't hear me. We've... -talked and said everything we wanted to say. -Okay. (snorting) (sniffles) (music continuing) (snorts) (speaking softly) ♪ ♪ So, I think that he's passed, whatever that means. I think that he's gone. (classical music continuing) ♪ ♪ -(birds chirping) -(mooing) ♪ ♪ (dog barking) Emilie: Well, Ryan and I have always been very open and honest with our kids when they ask questions. We try to give them the truth in a way that a five-year-old can understand, and we've never wanted to lie or to sugarcoat anything. This is Garrett being Garrett. Wasn't eating his cookie. He took my mashed potatoes instead of a cookie. (laughter) -(indistinct audio) -Emilie: Jump and roll. But even on chemo, he had all that energy. He had been taking chemo. That was that nasty stuff. He was still doing push-ups. Emilie: You know, I think back about life before Garrett got sick, and... you know, we really felt like we had everything. We had a great house, a great family. We got to do all of the things that we wanted to do. Once Garrett got diagnosed with cancer, everything just changed. ♪ ♪ This was his Make-A-Wish trip and... he had such a good time, even though he wasn't feeling the greatest, and, ultimately, we ended up having to get him a wheelchair because he just couldn't walk. But even so, he would be like, "Mommy, take a picture of me," and "Mommy, look at me," and... he was just so sweet. Emilie: It's beautiful, isn't it? When it's dark outside, they all glow. That makes it very beautiful. How about we just light the candles and leave the luminaries in there 'cause you can't really see them. So, this was Delfina's idea. ♪ ♪ We've been pulling some of Garrett's favorite things in here. He loved Batman, so we picked out the Batman figures. And... he used to always carry around a koozie of Batman that we have down on the bottom. And this is the blue bunny that he used to take all the time at the hospital. And then we have... Thor. He loved superheroes, so... we have Thor's hammer, as well as some other Batman stuff. This is something that reminds her of Garrett and brings her closer to Garrett, and that helps. When we got the news that he was terminal, we never actually told Garrett that he was gonna pass away. That he wasn't gonna live. ♪ ♪ We just started talking a lot about how not everybody wins their battle with cancer. And... you know, we just really started having some of those conversations that you never wish that you had to have with your children. We tried to do it as organically as we could. You know, we'd pass a cemetery, and Garrett would say, "Why are funerals sad? You know... funerals shouldn't be sad." Or, "Why do you go to funerals if they're sad?" And that's when we started talking and he'd say things. "Well, at my funeral, I want five bouncy houses "because I'm five years old, and I want snow cones, and I want Batman to come to my funeral." And those types of things. And so, it really spawned for us our want to help Garrett have his wishes come true. So, he couldn't be here with us, but we could make his funeral not sad. (kids screaming) ♪ ♪ (kids chattering) At first, I wanted a funeral. But then I started thinking, he didn't want that. He wanted his bouncy houses. He wanted his snow cones. He wanted Batman. So, we made sure of all that. We wanted to make sure people were happy and having fun here. So, we did exactly what he wanted. It just felt right. (kids chattering) Emilie: We had a celebration of life that was non-traditional and very... happy. Ryan: People weren't used to that, right? This is something different, and they didn't know what to expect. Emilie: Everybody got really into the celebration and it was fun. It was very much like a carnival. It was very healing to see the beautiful things and all of the kids having a great time. There were so many kids here, and the laughter, and they were running around playing and... you know, really celebrating Garrett's life instead of... -being sad because he had passed away. -Yeah. Emilie: Death comes so quickly. You don't think about it until it's happening. And then, you fall into tradition and call a funeral home, and you kind of fall into that routine because... it's safe and it's the norm. Through everything, what I learned is that we're the biggest advocates for our family, for ourselves, and it's okay to be different. It's okay to do whatever makes you happy. It's okay to do something special that's out of the ordinary, non-traditional, to celebrate and to honor somebody's life. -(fireworks whistling) -(cheering) (explosions) (cheering) ♪ ♪ And I think that we can do the things that are important to us and still have all of the support from the family and from our community. -(rocket roaring) -(cheering) It's okay to talk about -what you want after you pass away. -(crying) It's okay to have those conversations. Death doesn't have to be scary. Hold true to what you want, and make it happen. (birds chirping) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
