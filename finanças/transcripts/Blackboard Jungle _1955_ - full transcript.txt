I believe I have an appointment with the principal. Name? Name? Richard Dadier. Business, please? I've been here before. It's about the English teacher's job. Sit down, please. Thank you. Not at all. [Typewriting] Mr. Dadier, Richard. Good luck. In case anything turns up-- we'll call you, Mr. Lefkowitz. Mr., uh...Dadier? Yes, sir. Thank you. What college did you attend? I believe it's right there on the form, isn't it, sir? But that was an all-girls' school. Yes, well, they took in veterans after the war, you see. I believe they still do. So many of us coming back all at once, it was a little difficult to find a school or a college. Veteran, hmm? Yes, sir. I was in the Navy, sir. I beg your pardon? I was in the n-- you speak very softly. Can you be heard at the back of a classroom? Well, I... I did some dramatics at college, sir, and they could always hear me in the very last row. Really? Sh-shall I project a little, sir? Go ahead and project. Uh... "Once more unto the breach, "dear friends, once more! "Or close up the wall with our English dead. "In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man "as modest stillness and humility, but when the blast of war blows in our ears..." "Then imitate the action of the tiger." Very aptly chosen. Henry iv, wasn't it? It was Henry V, I believe. Right. Give your credentials to miss Brady in the outer office. You--you mean I have the job? Congratulations. Oh, thanks. Better meet some of the other teachers and get acquainted. Organizational meeting in an hour. Any questions? No. No, sir. Just one question, sir. The discipline problem here-- I beg your pardon? Well, I understand-- there is no discipline problem in this school, Mr. Dadier. Not as long as I'm principal. I see. Thank you, sir. Miss Brady, my credentials. Mr. Edwards, Joshua. Thank you very much. Not at all. Shall I-- anyway, he says to me, "exaggeration. Pure exaggeration. "There is absolutely no discipline problem here." And there's no discipline problem at Alcatraz, either. You can't teach a disorderly mob. That's right. You got to have discipline, and that means obedience. Yeah? How you gonna get that? With a ruler. Take a ruler to one of these delinquents, he'll beat you to death with it. Oh, my name's Murdock. New teacher? English. Richard Dadier. Lou savoldi. Carpentry. George Katz. Social science. I'm taking money under the false pretense of teaching history. I thought you developed their muscles. No, developing my own. Getting in shape to defend myself for the fall term. You make it sound like a reform school. Oh, first teaching job, eh? That's right. Don't listen to him, Dadier. He's a cynic. Why not? This is the garbage can of the educational system. You take most of these schools and put them together, and what have you got? One big, fat overflowing garbage can. Think of teaching in an all-girls' school. Think of those 20-year jail sentences. Got any tips for a rookie? Two. Don't be a hero... And never turn your back on the class. Manners, come here. How long you been teaching here? Oh, 12 years. 2 purple hearts and no salary increase. They hire fools like us with college degrees to sit on that garbage can, keep 'em in school, so women, for a few hours a day, can walk around the city without getting attacked. Woman: Really? I mean, there must be some students who want to learn. You gonna teach 'em in that outfit? Because if those kids ever get a look at-- have you arranged with the national guard to escort you to class every day? Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Your principal, Mr. Warneke. Welcome. Welcome to the old faces. Welcome to the new faces. Miss Panucci. Say... These kids, they can't all be bad, can they? No? Why? Miss Hammond, Mr. Warneke. [Train passing] Makes you feel good, doesn't it? It's funny. I didn't think it would affect me this way. After all, it's only a job, but when I stepped into my own classroom, it was just like reaching a goal. I don't believe I got your name. Oh, Edwards. Josh Edwards. 2 first names, like Harry James. Do you like swing? Yeah, most of it. I've got a really fine collection. I can't remember ever being so excited. It'll pass. Wait till Monday. The way some of the teachers were talking-- you don't really expect any trouble, do you? I mean, I figure you can handle any kid if-- if you can handle them. How's the most beautiful wife in the whole world? Hot, tired... I don't feel very much like anything, especially not attractive. I just feel 4 months pregnant. Beautifully pregnant. Champagne? And ravioli! That's not all. Oh, you got the job! Oh, darling! Congratulations, professor. You want some cheese? Oh, champagne and ravioli. Now, that's no way to feed an unborn child. Well, champagne, that's for the mother. That's for luck. I've had luck from the very first moment we met, Anne. What? Is something wrong? What's the matter, dear? Nothing. Now, look, honey. It's all gonna be over real soon. Oh, no, no. It's not that. It's just that... I don't want to let you down again, that's all. You've never let me down. Ever. I don't know what happened the last time. Now, look. It's not your fault. A lot of women lose babies. I mean, after all, it was only 2 months. I know. I can't help thinking about it. I just don't want anything to happen. Nothing's going to happen. It's gonna be 7 1/2 pounds in weight, it's gonna have your looks and my brains, and it's gonna support us in our old age. The most important thing, darling, is you mustn't worry. Please, no bad memories, huh? No guilty feelings, please. Please, Anne. And you don't mind my being this way? How could I mind? I'm responsible, aren't I? Here. To the three of us. To the three of us. [Car tires screech, jazz music blares] You all right? What happened? Crazy kids, that's what happened. [Chaotic clamor] Hey, you owe me a quarter! How are you, man? Good morning. Good morning. Last time I felt like this was when we hit the beach at Salerno. At least they're not shooting at us here. Not yet. Good morning. How do you do? Do I look all right? Ravishing. I'm really very nervous. Do you think they'll like me? They may even fight over you. Hi! I thought you said you weren't coming! Testing! Testing! 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Hey, lookit! He knows how to count up to 4! Sure, man. He graduated from this school, didn't he? [Whistles] [Whistling, cheering] Shut up! All right. That's enough stupid nonsense. Next guy opens his trap knows what happens. Who's that? I think he teaches public speaking or something. I don't know. By this time, you already said hello to everybody, so cut the yakkety, and we'll get down to business. First, in the name of your principal, Mr. Warneke, I want to welcome you back to north manual. Aw! Aw! Now without further ado, we'll have the teachers call out the rolls of their official classes. When you hear your name called out, you fall out. And the first guy gives trouble gets trouble right back. We start with the seniors. And 'cause we're gentlemen, the ladies come first. We got a new teacher here. She's gonna take care of you senior boys. Miss Hammond, please. [Wolf whistles] [Whistling] Miss Hammond. [Voice cracks] Frank-- Frank Adams. Hey, lucky old me. Shut up! Edward Alpina, Donald Beck, Samuel Barstow, Harry Cohen... All right. This way. Up those stairs down there, please. There'll be no talking on the way up! Hey, teach, what'd Mr. Halloran say your name was? I said there'd be no talking on the way up. Yeah, he's playing it real hard. He's a big man! [Door closes] Hey, hold it. You. You. What's the matter? What's the matter, boy? Hey, you. You! Who, me? Yes, you. What's your name? Why? What's your name? What are you picking on me for? I'm not picking on you. I'm asking what your name is. You mean, you never heard of Artie west? All right, west, I want you to monitor this class for a minute. Write down the names of anybody who talks, you understand? Talks about what? Anything. If they open their mouth, just write their name down. I haven't got a pencil. Well, I haven't got any paper. Just take it, will ya? Take it please. Want a pencil? What'd you make the kid cry for? It wasn't my fault. Hey, cheese it. Hold it. Just hold it. What is this, the officers' club or something? I don't want to catch any of you smoking in here again. You understand? Now get out. Come on. You heard what I said. Get out. What's the matter? You 2 guys privileged characters or something? We only just got here, chief. You did, huh? Well, now just get out. Can't a man wash his hands, chief? Wash 'em and get out. Sure, chief. You gonna watch me? Maybe you'd like to wash 'em for us. What's your name? You. I'm talking to you. Me? Yes, you! Emmanuel. Emmanuel what? Emmanuel trades. Don't you know, man? This boy got the school named after him. What's your name, wise guy? Me? Miller. Gregory Miller. You want me to spell it out for you so you won't forget it? No, no. You don't have to do that. I'll remember, Miller. Sure, chief. You do that. Or maybe you'd like to take a walk down to the principal's office right now with me. Is that what you want? You're holdin' all the cards, chief. You want to take me to see Mr. Warneke, you do just that. Who's your home period teacher? You are, chief. Why aren't you with the rest of the class? I already told ya. Came in to wash up, chief. All right, then wash up. Cut out that "chief" routine, you understand? Sure, chief. That's what I been doin' all the time. Ok for us to drift now, chief? I don't want to catch you in here again. Suppose I got business here, chief? Look, how many times do I have to tell you? Let's go, huh? Come on, let's go! Let's go, bright boy. Hey, wait. He means me. Hey, hey! De lica, how are you? All right, sit anywhere. We'll arrange permanent seating later. You want to close the door for me there? Hey, how about that miss Hammond? All right, let's break it up back there. Hear what I said? I said, break it up! Why? What'd you say? I said, "why?" Sit down. The first thing we're gonna do is pass these cards out. Take one, pass the rest back. The number of this class is 55. The number of the classroom is 206. My name is spelled d-a-d-i-e-r. Now, that's pronounced "da Di--" whoever threw that, you'll never pitch for the yanks, boy. Hey, Artie, how do you like Mr. daddy-o? Daddy-o! Daddy-o! Daddy-o! Daddy-o! You all finished? Fine. Glad you got that out of your system. The name is Dadier. Mr. Dadier. Pronunciation is a very important part of English. I'd hate to fail anybody who couldn't pronounce my name. Me, too, teach. Mr. Dadier. Say it. And take your hat off in this classroom. You ever try to fight 35 guys at one time, teach? Take your hat off, boy, before I knock it off. Now, the subject you're gonna learn in this class is English. Some of you may wonder if English can help you get a job as a carpenter, a mechanic, or an electrician. The answer is yes. In fact, it may even surprise you to find English is your favorite subject. I'd be surprised, all right. There'll be no calling out now. If you've got any questions to ask, just raise your hand. You hear that, Miller? Sure, teach. You comin' in strong. I can't tune you out. His name ain't teach! It's daddy-o. Don't you know his name, jerk? Excuse me, Mr. jerk. All right, west, since you're so cooperative, suppose you stay after class and help me out. I'm busy. Oh, go on, Artie. Help him out. Then you can be together alone. Oh, daddy-o! [Wolf whistles] All right. All right. Fine. We had a few laughs. In a minute, the bell's gonna ring out there. That means you go to your civics class. Tomorrow morning, when you come into this class-- hey, teach, you're coming back here tomorrow? Sure, I'm coming back. Do you know why? 'Cause I'll miss you, west. Ooooh! All right. Let's knock it off. Now, come on, huh? That's enough, huh? What's the matter with you? You, Santini, what's your problem? Me? Yeah. What are you grinning for? He's the grinningest cat in this whole school. He smiles all the time. That's 'cause he's an idiot-boy. Well, just try and pay attention, Santini. I pay attention. [Bell rings] Hey, Miller! Come here. I want to talk to you a minute, Miller. Man-to-man talk, huh, Miller? You know, I've been looking up the records, and you're a natural born leader. Really? Yeah, you are. Those guys out there, they like you very much. Now, don't be modest with me, Miller. You know that you're a little brighter, a little smarter than the rest of those guys. Me? Yeah. And every class needs a leader. You could be that leader, Miller. What you do, they'll do. You cooperate, and they'll follow you. How about it, Miller? I don't know. But I do know, Miller. How about it? Sure, if you think so. That's a boy. Good. That's fine, Miller. Oh, uh, is this yours? Yeah. Take it easy, man. Sure, man. [Ding] Good night. Good night. Why, hello. Miss Hammond. Oh, how did it go today? You mean after my disaster this morning? My entire class volunteered to stay after school and pound erasers or something. Got a ride home? I have a private limousine. Oh? City bus. My way's more private. I'll give you a lift. Well, I have to check out first. Oh, that's all right. I'll meet you downstairs. They don't even know their multiplication tables. Of course not. All they can multiply is themselves. Well, how are they ever graduated? Graduated? Going down? No. Going up. Graduated?! They just get to be 18. Then they're thrown out to make room for more of the same kind. [Thump] Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! You cockroach! What happened? Nothing. Huh? Nothing. What is it? What happened? Why, it's the first day of school, teacher. The way she screamed, the way she looked-- scared. Man, I mean, real scared. I thought, "this could be happening to Anne." And then I hit him. Maybe she provoked the boy. What? Well, teachers ought not to dress sexy. What do you mean, sexy? She had on, what do you call it, one of these sport outfits, buttoned right up to here. I'll bet. With black net stockings, too. No, they were flesh-colored. I see. Rick? Yeah? Is she beautiful? Who? Miss Hammond, that's who, miss desirable Hammond. Oh, yeah, I'd say that in a-- well, kind of a flashy way, she's-- yeah, I'd say she's... She's attractive. What was I wearing when you came home tonight? What were you wearing? Hmm. You never noticed, did you? Now, wait a minute. Let me think. What were you wearing? You were wearing-- let's see. You had on that blue outfit, didn't you? No! It was a bl-- a pink--the pink dress with the blue ribbon. You know, that little ribbon you wear up here? And you had on a little apron. You didn't take your iron tablets. Yes, I took my iron tablets. You didn't think I was very sexy. I thought you were irresistible. Prove it. What about your calcium tablets? More, please. Did you take them? Hmm? Don't be so medical. Look, what was she wearing? What were you wearing? What's all this about-- what was I wearing when I came home? Turn out the lights and hold me. What was I wearing? You remember? You don't remember, do you? Your brown suit. No, it wasn't the brown suit. Your gray suit. No. Striped necktie? Mm-mmm. No? You don't remember, do you? Now does that prove that you don't love me? Just proves I'm silly, jealous, and love you too much. Aw, he looked terrible. Must've hit him from behind. I don't know. Teach must have some wallop. Nah. He hit him with brass knuckles. That's right. I seen 'em. He carries 'em in that little ol' bag of his. 4 transfusions Joey had to have. His nose was busted, too. What do you think, Artie? Man, they say he slugged Joe so hard he knocked all his front teeth out. What did the teach hit him with? Ain't you heard? The teach was middleweight champ of the Navy. Hey, George! Morning, Miller. Now today we're going to pinpoint some of your faults in grammar. I've written several sentences on the board. I want you to read those sentences using the proper word. Now, does everybody understand that? You're very quiet today. All right. Now, let's get started. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Because, after all, that's how you learn-- by making mistakes. All right, Miller, will you take the first one? "Henry hasn't written no answer to my letter." No, Miller, it should be "Henry hasn't written any answer to my letter." De lica, second one. "If I were him, I wouldn't say that." No, if I were you, I wouldn't say that either. It should be "if I were he." All right, west, the third one. "I throwed the ball fast." All right, come on, west. You know better than that. This is third term stuff. You had that 2 years ago. "Won't anyone borrow you a pen?" "The class choose him as president." "Where was you when it happened?" Well... We didn't do very well with this, did we? All right. I think a little homework will straighten that out. Homework?! Yes, homework. You can start copying all 35 of these sentences in your notebooks right now. I gotta go to work after school, teach! This homework will count as a test. It might decide whether you pass or fail this course. Miller? This... This was your idea, wasn't it? What idea is that? This silent treatment, picking the wrong answers deliberately. Look, I know you're the leader, fine. But you're leading them in the wrong direction. Why? Maybe you ought to mind your own business, chief. Ain't many guys like what happened to Joe Murray. He goin' to jail, you know that? I see. That's why you set the class against me? They don't need no excuse or me to help 'em. What about that talk we had, Miller? Suppose we just forget about that little snow job, Mr. Dadier. Hi. I wanted to thank you. It's all right. Would you mind walking out to the car with me? With those kids out there and all, I... No. If it's too much trouble for you-- no, not at all. Thanks. I hope I haven't hindered you with your classes. How'd you make out today? Oh, the boys were very quiet. Guess I know what they were thinking. Hello, Josh. Hi. How about a drink? Yeah. Fine. Let's go over there. [Stan Kenton record playing on jukebox] I gotta-- I gotta get home. Oh, this is the last one. For the road. For the road. Road. Oh. Mmm. Stan the man. Hmm? Terrific stuff. Very educated gentleman. Yeah. Just like our students. Everything always comes back to our students. You know something? Hmm? I am disappointed, very disappointed. Hmm. Listen. Listen to this passage. Mind those trumpets. Go, man. Oh, bartender? I wonder if there are many alcoholics among high school teachers. It's not fair, Rick. Hmm? I want to teach. I really want to teach. So why don't they let me teach? Any man who really wants to teach should be allowed to teach. To teach. I know. Did I tell you? What? I'm bringing my record collection in and playing it for the class. Yeah. Yeah, what? [Slurring] What do you mean, what? You told me you're bringing your record-- let me ask-- now, wait a minute. Suppose they don't like it, the records? Why not? It took me 15 years to collect those records. Half those records can't even be replaced. Besides, music is based on mathematics, am I right? Yeah. Yeah. What do I teach? Mathematics. You're right. Absolutely. To teaching. [Clink] To teaching. I gotta get home fast. My--my wife's pregnant, you know. Well, congratulations! Hey, let's take a cut through here. Shortcut to the bus, huh? All right. Yes, sir, it's the best profession anywhere. Kids. Yep. Best profession anywhere. So why don't they let me teach? I don't know. I guess just 'cause they're bad guys. They're not bad, they're just ignorant. Bad and ignorant. You don't really believe that, do you? No, I-- I don't really mean it, Josh, I-- I don't really mean it. [Thump] Josh. Hmm? That's funny. What? What's funny? Footsteps. You hear those footsteps? Hey, daddy-o! I don't want you to forget Joe Murray, teach! [Sirens] Oh, Josh. Josh. [Groan] [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello? Mr. Dadier there? Uh, no. No, no, he isn't here right now. Who is this? [Click] Hello? [Doorbell buzzes] Turn out the lights. Well, Rick-- the lights. Rick! You mustn't be scared. I'm ok. Well, I'll call a doctor. No, no. I'll be all right. Just don't look at me, Anne, please. No, please, you mustn't. A thing like this could-- I don't want you to lose the baby, Anne. Oh. You're never going back to that school again. Never! Oh, yes, I am. Yeah, I've been beaten up, but I'm not beaten. There's a big difference. I'm not beaten, and I'm not quitting. What's the answer, professor? Now, I'm going back to the school tomorrow. Anne doesn't want me to go, and I-- Maybe she's right. Is it hopeless? Is there no way to get through to those kids? Is there no way to make them understand? You'll find a way. Well, what if I don't? What then? What's the point of teaching if kids don't care about an education? And make no mistake about it. They don't. You're wrong. You're the blind man who visits an elephant. He feels a tail and he says, "ah. An elephant must be like a snake." Come. Porto, to carry.

The kind of students I have-- why bother with them? In this country, all children are entitled to an education. I'm not prepared for my job. You were my professor in college. You should've taught me how to stop a fight in a classroom, how to deal with an I.Q. Of 66, how to quiet a class of screaming wild animals. No, why bother about them? They'll survive without me. But who wants wild animals in the street? If I'm gonna be a lion tamer, I should teach with a chair and a whip. Yes, we at the university were to blame. We did not prepare the teachers to teach certain children of this generation. Tell me, Richard, why do you want to be a teacher? Just to earn a living? No. Because it's easier perhaps than some other job? Easier? Perhaps you're dedicated? No, hardly. No, I want to teach. Most of us want to do something creative. I can't be a painter or a writer or an engineer, but I thought if I could help to shape young minds-- sort of sculpt lives-- then by teaching, I'd be creating. For every school like yours, there are hundreds like this one. We could use you, but your school needs you. You still want to teach here in this school? [Sighs] I think I'll take another crack at my jungle. The report says you couldn't identify any of the boys. It was dark. I told you, it was dark. I couldn't see anything. What are you protecting-- the good name of this school, your job, what? Somebody have to get kicked to death before you'll cooperate? It wasn't that serious. You couldn't make class for a week. I'd say that was serious. Well, what do you expect me to do? Press charges. I'll find the ones who did it. I'll go over every kid in this school. Yes, and you'll do more harm than good. Mr. Dadier, I've handled lots of problem kids in my time, kids from both sides of the tracks. They were 5 or 6 years old in the last war. Father in the army, mother in a defense plant, no home life, no church life, no place to go. They form street gangs. It's way over my head, Mr. Dadier. Maybe the kids today are like the rest of the world-- mixed up, suspicious, scared. I don't know. But I do know this-- gang leaders have taken the place of parents, and if you don't stop them-- class is starting. Do you mind? Then you won't help us? I'm sorry. Sure. And I hope you'll never be sorrier. Thanks anyway. For what? Tying our hands so it can happen again? And don't worry. It will. Welcome back, chief. You bring your cosmetics to school, chief? Don't get touchy, chief. I know lots of guys use makeup. Well... At least the silent treatment seems to have ended. [Buzzing] New machine shop, chief. Since when? Installed her last week. Does this-- does this go on all the time? Most anytime. Oh, no. That's great. That's all we needed. This is a-- a tape recorder. Was we gonna make records, teach? That's right. Well, go, man, go! [Loudly] Now, we all talk too much, but nobody list-- [buzzing stops] [Laughter] No-nobody listens. And, uh, well, I thought that perhaps if we talk into this machine and then we listen-- ohh, it's a speech period. "How I spent my summer vacation." This ought to be real jazzy. No, no speeches-- [buzzing] If there was one thing I didn't like when I went to high school-- teach, teach, did you go to high school? Can't you see, man? He ain't never got out. Well, since you want to talk so very badly, I guess I'm not gonna have much trouble getting you to talk into this machine. What kind of talk? Snappy stories? Miller... How'd you like to bring your mother to school? How'd you like to bring yours? Hey, Morales got a sister. Maybe he'd like to bring her. Come on with those records, man! ♪ Da-da da-da da-dah ♪ Hey, what do you say we all-- we all sing a little, huh? Come on. The last rose of summer. Hey, teach, you got that recorder going? Quiet! All right, now. Who's gonna be the first to try this out, huh? Miller: How about Morales? Hey, what's the matter with Morales? Morales, he loves to talk. No. Tomita, suppose you step up here and try it. You against Morales 'cause he don't talk good English? That has nothing to do with it. Hey, Morales, come on, get up there. I wanna hear you talk. Come on. Come on. Aw, come on, chicken. We want Morales! We want Morales! Hey, chicken! We want Morales! [Clucking] I no chicken! [Buzzing] All right. Start talking. What am I gonna talk about? Talk about anything. How you got up this morning, took the bus to school. Well-- Go ahead. I got up at 7:30, go wash, but my stinkin' sister, she's in the bathroom so I can't get in. [Laughter] That's fine, boy. Just keep talking. So then I go to the stinkin' bathroom, I wash my stinkin' face, then I eat some stinkin' sausages. Hey, louder. Come on. We can't hear you in the balcony. Then I go down the stinkin' street, with my stinkin' books, then I meet the stink-face who lives near me. And he says, "you go to school, Pete?" So I says, "you stinkin' right." So we walk to the stinkin' El, and we wait for the stinkin' train, and whaddya think? The stinkin' train is late. So I gotta get into a stinkin' crowd. [Laughter] And that's why I'm stinkin' late to school, teach. [Laughter] How was I? Ok? You sure stunk up that record, boy! [Applause] More! More! [Whistling] That'll be enough for today. Aren't you gonna play it back? No. Thanks for picking Morales. I'm sure you're his friends. Sure enough, chief. Too bad you can't say the same. Now just what does that mean? Morales is a spic, that's what it means. Maybe--I don't know-- maybe you don't like spics. That'll be enough of that, west. What did I do, anyhow? All right, sit down...Spic. Yeah. At least I'm no Irish Mick! I said that'd be enough! Pick up that magazine, Belazi. Pick it up. I want to get one thing very clear in this classroom. There's not gonna be any name-calling here, not today, not tomorrow, not ever! Now, you understand that, all of you? I was just kidding. Yeah, I know. "Just kidding." That's how things start, just kidding. Like a street fight. Somebody pushes somebody, somebody pushes back. Pretty soon, you've got a street fight with no kidding. That's the same way with name-calling. All right, west, look. You're of Irish descent, all right? So is Murphy over there. You call him a Mick, he calls you a Mick. But suppose Miller here calls you a Mick. Is that all right? No. Then you call him a nigger. I was just kidding. Well, stop kidding! Sure, come on, come on. Tell me all about your stinkin' sister. [Bell rings] You gonna play Morales' record back, chief? [Buzzing] [Telephone rings] Mr. Warneke wanted to see me? Sit down, please. But, Mr. Warneke-- there are no buts, Murdock-- none that can forgive slapping a student. If you can't control yourself... Yes, sir, I understand. Warneke: Dadier? He's rough today. Sit down, Dadier. Problems... Nothing but problems, eh, Dadier? Well, not the same that you have, sir. If it isn't one thing, it's another-- brutality, stupidity, bigotry. Would you believe that some teachers are guilty of racial prejudice in their classes, in this school? I--I wouldn't know, sir. It comes out under pressure, I suppose. Yeah, I suppose so. If you knew of such a teacher, would you tell me about it? I don't know. You don't know? Why not? I don't know. This idea of carrying tales-- you have someone particular in mind, Mr. Warneke? What part of the country are you from? [Train passing] How do you feel about Negroes, Dadier? What do you mean, how do I feel about them? Do you consider them inferior? You mean as a race? Any way. No, I don't consider them inferior. What about spics? Spics? Spics. Do you like them? Well, it depends on the individual. What does that mean, Dadier? There are puerto ricans I like, there are puerto ricans I don't like. I see. What about Irish micks? Look, Mr. Warneke, I don't know what this is all about. If there's some teacher who's teaching-- I'm talking about you, Dadier. You're the teacher who's supposed to be the bigot. What? It's reported that you've maligned religious and racial groups in your classroom. That's what this is about, Dadier. That's a lie. Is it? Did you use the expression "nigger" in your class? Yes. Then it is true. Now just wait a minute-- did you use the expression "spic"? Yes. I used it in the same lesson-- lesson? Yes! What textbook did you get this from? Just listen to me a minute, now. You listen! I don't care if a boy's skin is black, yellow, or purple! He gets the same teaching, the same breaks as any white boy. Do you understand that? Do you? There's enough immorality in the world without your adding to it. Enough hatred, enough blind stupidity-- hold it! Will you just hold it? I used that expression to teach a lesson in democracy-- what should not be said. Those were negative examples. Not according to my report. This boy has accused you-- what boy? A boy in your class. What was his name? I can't tell you that. Well, suppose he's lying. Don't I have any right to face my accuser? Don't I have any rights at all? I know I don't have any as a teacher left, but what about my rights as a human being? Nobody's depriving you of any rights. You accused me. You condemned me without even a hearing! Look, I'm sorry, Dadier. I may have been hasty. If I'm wrong, I apologize. You were wrong. In that case... Dadier? I recall that you had some dramatic training in college. Will you take charge of our Christmas show? Well... Is this a penalty? This a reward? What it is? Just an extra job. All right. Miller? What were you doing? Doing? Yeah. I'm just goin' down to the machine shop, chief. This late after school? Doing a little homework on this carburetor. What kept you after school, chief? You doing your homework here, too? Miller. You went to see Mr. Warneke today, didn't you? Did I? Yes, you went to see Mr. Warneke, and you told him a lot of lies, a lot of deliberate lies. You twisted everything I said. There was no racial issue till you made one! Wait a minute, Miller. What is it, chief? What is what? Why you got the knife out for me? Why I've got the knife out for you? Oh, man, there's a real switch. I mean, after all the trouble you caused, after all you done, after the way you fouled up that recording session, after the way you and west-- steady now. Just a minute. The way me and west did what? Ganged up on me, that's what. You don't mean that, chief. I do mean it. Boy, you really got it bad. You deny it? Well, do you deny it? You gonna hit me? I'd really like that. That's all you need, boy! That'll really wash you up around here. Come on, start swinging. Come on. You go ahead. Come on. Why, you black-- go ahead and say it. You say it, now. You go ahead and hit me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry what I just said, Miller. There's no excuse. I just lost my head. I'm sorry. Yeah. Miller... [Voice singing in distance] The truck will be here any minute. You ready, Louie? Now come on! You just pay attention when I'm talking to you, stupid! We've been over it 50 times. I slug the guy, and pee wee takes the wheel. What's so special? Look, you just stay with him in case he needs you. That's what's so special. Look, you drive to-- drive to the park, dump the papers, then get rid of the truck. When the guy sells the papers, we meet right back here and we divvy up. Now, you got that? You sure you got it now? Don't worry about it. Go ahead, blow. Move. Well, how's the teaching business comin' along? [Truck horn honks] Hey, what's the chance of gettin' a job driving a truck like this? [Truck starts] [Truck drives away] Easy, teach. Easy. You could've got hurt over there just now. What happened, anyway? Where'd you come from? I was just strollin' down the street, and I saw some guy who threw a bottle right at ya. And I figured they're out to get you like last time. You know, you could've been maybe shot or somethin'. Yeah. Or something. That Belazi with those kids? Belazi? You mean from our class? That's right. Wearing the same kind of jacket. They're all wearing the same kind of jacket you are. You're members of the same gang, aren't you? No, it's a club, teach. It's a club I belong to, and I didn't see any Belazi. Oh, you didn't see those kids steal that newspaper truck there, either, did you? That's right. Just passin' by. Just like I said. I was just strollin' by. I mean, why should I lie to you? You know, I don't-- I don't give a damn what you believe. You know what'll happen when those kids are caught? What's that, teach? Reform school, year in jail--maybe more. Oh. You know, a year from now, the army comes by, and they say, "ok, Artie west, you get into uniform, "and you be a soldier, and you save the world, and you get your lousy head blowed right off." Or maybe--maybe I get a year in jail, and maybe when I come out, the army, they don't want Artie west to be a soldier no more. Maybe what I get is-- Is out. I see. Do ya, teach? Do ya? Well, west, you got it all wrong. Come on, get 'em off! Look, you're in my classroom now, and what I could teach you... The first lesson is don't butt in. Just don't. Or--or you could flunk out for good. [Train passing] [Phonograph playing early swing music] Hey, what you got there, teach? Oh, it's music. Isn't that music you had on there, teach? For the next class. Oh, what's the matter with this class? How's the disk jockey? Look at your records. Now just keep your hands off the records. Beg your pardon. Come on, teach! Will ya play somethin'? No, our Josh, he's got a test for us. Right, Josh? You see, music is based on mathematics, and... It's just that the next class is a little more advanced. We're advanced, teach. 2 times 2 is 4. Are 4. Besides, haven't you heard music is soothing to the savage beast? All right. Take--take your seats. We're just crazy about music, ain't we? Reet, boy. Mr. Edwards, Mr. Edwards, why not play a record, then we'll all take the test. Sure. Please? Aw, come on, teach. Well... All right. This, uh... This is kind of a rare one-- this is bix Beiderbecke doing jazz me blues. Ah! How about some bop? Yeah, bop us, teach. Listen to this. [Music playing] Pay attention to that cornet. Beiderbecke came before James and Elman and Spivak. How about Frank Sinatra? Yeah, Frankie baby! Ah, Joni James! Come on, get with it, man, eh? This is cow-cow boogie. All right, keep away from the records. Give me that. Sure, teach. Ha ha ha! This is Cherokee. Anybody wanna hear this record, huh? No! Hey, clap hands, here comes Charlie. [Jitterbug tune plays] Blue moon. Wait till Miller hears about this jam session. Where's that Miller man today, anyway? He's cuttin' class today. When there's action, he cuts. Funny. I was someplace else, too. Nobody was here today. [Needle scraping] They broke my records. I don't understand, Rick. I just don't understand. [Bang] Now, the broken records can never be replaced. The phonograph cost about $40. I don't know which of you did it, but I know that none of you tried to stop it. So, whenever you can, you just put your nickels and your dimes in this tin can. Can you deduct it from taxes? But how did Warneke discipline the kids? A masterful stroke. Heh. He taught those little Mongolians a lesson they'll never forget. You know what he did? He got 'em all in the auditorium, and he had 'em... He had 'em write 500 times, "I respect private property." Did anybody ever pay Edwards for those broken records? How about it, Dadier? Is that tin can full of money yet? He's lucky if they don't steal the tin can. Tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna rig up an electric chair and bring it to my carpentry class. I'll tell my pupils it's a circuit tester. Then I'll lead the little lice into the chair one by one. [Snap] Throw the switch on 'em. That's fine, except those kids'll rig up that hot seat first, throw you into it, and fry you to death. I'd have clobbered them. Would ya? Sure. Would ya? They outnumber you, they outweigh you, and they outreach you. Besides, they get clobbered at home and in the streets. They're used to it. That's why they understand it. What's that got to do with teaching? I never have any trouble, not real trouble. That's right, miss Panucci. He's a clobberer. You're a slobberer. "I'm just a nice woman trying to do my job. Now, please be nice, boys." You give them the veteran pitch. "I got the purple heart, boys." Oh! Or you tell 'em about--what is it? That steel plate in your head or that artificial leg. You beg for sympathy. "Look, I'm a veteran, fellas. Will ya help me keep my job?" But do you care if they learn anything? No! This guy's lucky they don't kick that artificial leg out from underneath him. And you-- You're a slumberer. You sleepwalk. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Oh, I mean, every once in a while, you make sounds like a--like a teacher. Nobody cares. Nobody listens. I mean nobody cares. Especially you. This man here, he's a grumbler. You hate the kids. You have contempt for them. All right, what about you, Zola? I'm--I'm a fumbler. I'm not doing any better than the rest of you. Well, what are we supposed to do? Start butting our heads against a stone wall with a lot of kids that don't want to learn in the first place? Yes. All right. How? I don't know how. I mean, there must be some way to... There must be some way to reach them. Whom are you trying to convince, me or you? [Bell rings] Rotten day, ain't it? Oh, hello, Mrs. Brophy. You shouldn't be walking in the snow. I like it. If I had a condition, I'd make them carry me like a Chinese pagoda. Where'd you go, the movies? It's funny, the habits you get into. Every morning, as soon as my husband goes to work, I turn on the radio, nothing but serials, in one ear and out the other. But one day, the radio breaks down. Oh, is it quiet! I thought I'd go crazy, stark-naked crazy. Your husband ain't home yet. I, uh, stopped in just now. I wanted a little rum for cooking, you know. What time is it? Oh, let me see. It's a little bit after 5:00. I don't care for liquor, personally, but my old man, he-- he just goes for it in a great way. You shouldn't be walking in the snow, Mrs. Dadier. Anne? Anne? I thought it was you. Is something wrong? No, no. No. It was late. You weren't home. I got lonely. Sorry I was late. What's a teacher do when he stays after school? Or is it ethical to tell? Josh Edwards quit his job today. I just helped him straighten his desk out. I tried to get him to change his mind, but-- he was right to quit. And if you had any sense, you'd get out of this place, too, be--before it's too late. What would I do? Sell shoelaces? Run for president? You'd teach in a decent place where kids want to learn, where a teacher's respected. I wrote to professor kraal. Here's his answer. He says he can get you a job in his school. Tell him yes, Rick. Maybe. We'll see. What's so important about this place? It's a challenge. What else is it? You want to stay. You want to stay in this filthy, miserable-- wait a minute. Come on now. Hold it. You've got enough troubles without me, you know. Have I told you today that I love you? Do you? What do you think? I'm selfish. I want to be told. Let's splurge and take a taxi home. We'll neck in the back seat. How about that? All right. Taxi! ♪ Were you there ♪ ♪ When they crucified ♪ ♪ My lord? ♪ ♪ When Israel was in Egypt land ♪ ♪ Let my people go ♪ ♪ Oppressed so hard they could not stand ♪ ♪ Let my people go ♪ ♪ Go down, Moses ♪ ♪ Way down in Egypt land ♪ No, man. This ain't no jam session. Stop jazzing it up, ok? All right, let's pick it up at "go down, Moses." ♪ go down, Moses ♪ ♪ Way down in Egypt land ♪ ♪ Tell old pharaoh ♪ ♪ Let my people go ♪ Sounded real-- real nice. Fair, chief. It'll get better. Cut out, fellas. I'll see you later. If you're wonderin' about this, we didn't break in. Mr. Halloran loaned us the use of the hall. No, no. I-- [Plays piano] I was just wondering if, uh... Maybe we'd play a spot on your Christmas show? Yeah. I figured. Would you? That's why we've been rehearsing, Mr. Dadier. Where'd you learn to play the piano this way? Oh, picked it up. What are the rules, Miller? Rules? Yeah, what are the rules? I mean, you can be so cooperative on a thing like this. In my classroom, I--I-- you better get a move on, teach. You'll be late for your own class. Want to walk up with me? I'll be along. Yeah. Help! Faster! Faster! Wha--hey! Oh, ho! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! [Crash] Jack ran for the beanstalk. The giant was close behind him. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! [Thump] Ha ha ha! So Jack got rich, and when he grew up, he married a Princess, and they lived happily forever after. [Fanfare plays] [Whistling] More! More! Hey, teach, how about the main feature? Marilyn Monroe, eh? Humphrey Bogart! Well, what did you think of the story? It was lousy. There was no dames. Miller, what did you think? Well, this Jack, he's a pretty cool cat, all right. I don't like fairy stories, ya know? Speranza? Oh, I don't know. I kinda felt sorry for the giant. Oh, why's that? Well, this Jack, he ain't no hero. He's a pretty dumb hick. Yeah, look, his old lady sends him out to sell the cow. Well, Jack the jerk meets up with a con man and he let him have the cow for a couple of crazy beans. Yeah. That wasn't so smart! And then he climbed that old beanstalk until he disappeared in another land. Without a space helmet, man? How did that giant get up there without any beanstalk? This is a fairy story. He just flew. I got this Jack pegged for a thief. Oh? Well, the giant was supposed to kill Jack's father and steal his money. How'd Jack know that? Suppose Jack thought that the giant stole from him? Did that give Jack the right to steal the hen that laid the golden egg? No. He's gotta have proof. Suppose he had the proof. What then? Jack--he shoulda called the cops. Yeah, and the cops would have kept the loot for themselves, too. That's right. Could be. Not the FBI. [Whistling, applause] And that magic harp, hmm? If the giant would have been so bad, the harp would have wanted to be snatched. Could be. Now, why do you suppose that harp liked that giant so much? I know. You do? 'Cause the giant, he liked music. That Jack was a real heist man. He got away with burglary 3 times. I liked the part where he knocked off the giant. Ah, who cares? The whole thing here's a phony! Wilson, do you think Jack should have killed the giant? Yeah. Yeah, sure. He was chasin' him. If somebody stole from you, wouldn't you chase them? The way I got it figured, this Jack, he's a square. First off, he don't care if his old lady starves to death. On the button, man. Didn't he sell the cow for a handful of beans? Then he turned burglar. And then he commit murder. And for all of this, he gets a reward. He's rich. And he marries a Princess. You know why? Because he took what he wanted. Because crime always pays. It was a crime, wasn't it? So what? Yeah, it was only some stinkin' giant anyway. Why don't you like the giant? Because he's a giant? You don't like Dodgers fans, is that right? No, kidding, fellas. I mean, you don't like the giant because he's different than anybody else. That's right. But is that right? I mean, is it right to dislike somebody just because he's different? I mean, there's a lot of us right here in this classroom who are different than anybody else. Yeah, but if the story's so cockeyed, then what's the point of it? Now we're getting somewhere. Now, all your lives, you're gonna hear stories-- what some guy tells you, what you see in books, in magazines, on the television and radio, what you read in the newspapers. But if you can just examine the story, look for the real meaning, and, most of all, fellas, and if you'll just learn to think for yourselves-- here it comes! Here comes the commercial! [Laughter] [Bell rings] That giant, if he done wrong, at least I think he should have had a trial. Hey, teach, how about some more stories like that? Yeah, a story about football. Hey, teach maybe I'll turn out to be a critic on the movies. How did you like that Jack in the beanstalk? He turned out to be a thief like everybody else. I liked the story. So you finally got through to them. I think so. Yes, for once, for the first time. Well, what's the answer-- visual education? Yeah, partly. I mean, if you can just get them stimulated. Sure, they'll go for movies, but will that teach them to read? But if you can get them to use their imagination, get them to reach out for something. But certainly not knowledge. Yeah, but if they'd use their intelligence, get their minds out of comic books. Minds? A mind would indicate a brain, and a brain-- before he proves Darwin was right, I've got a class. Oh, uh, look, if you still need a Santa Claus for your Christmas show-- yeah, I do. Well, you've got one. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Hello. Your husband won't be home today. He's gonna be with her. Who is this? Hello? Hello? [Click] Move in a little bit, fellas, just a little closer together. Now, will you hit them with the spot here? Wait. I can't see. Turn the footlights out. That's it. Now, raise it up. I just want to catch their faces. Up--that's it. All right, now, remember that effect, huh? Got it. All right, fellas. Let's see that work light here, would ya? Miller, stick around a minute, will ya? I want to talk to you about an encore. Oh... I'm gonna go. Oh, I'm bushed. Thanks for staying. It's shaping up ok, huh? Hey, isn't it always quiet before an earthquake? Good night, before he has 'em burning the school down. Well, now that you mention it-- good night. Well, could I be wrong? Have you got these wild animals trained? No, not trained. Just interested. Don't forget your history. Never turn your back. Good night. Good night. You coming? I have a little more work to do. Uh-huh. Need me for anything else, Mr. director? No, thanks. That's too bad. The costumes are fine, Lois-- I know what you mean. That's why it's too bad. Look, Lois. You're tired. No, not tired. Just bored. Just good and bored. You know, maybe I shouldn't have transferred to this school. Maybe I should have-- tell me, Rick, don't you ever get fed up with this place? Don't you ever get tired of teaching? Don't you feel that you want to throw your briefcase away and take a flier someplace, anyplace, with me maybe? Don't you? Don't you, Rick? Ahh, I guess not. You'd like to, all right, but you're married. You're married, and I'm bored. You're afraid, and I'm choosy, and you can't be choosy, or you live alone. You keep thinking that way, you're gonna end up in a mess of trouble. Mr. Dadier? I'll be right with you, Miller. I got to get to my job. Good night, Lois. [Ring] [Ring] Darling? Your husband is with her right now. Stop it. Stop it. Please, please don't call anymore. Would you please leave me alone? Please leave me alone. [Click] I don't need no more schooling. Why? Why, Miller? What's wrong with being a mechanic? You don't want to be, do you? There ain't much choice, is there? For the same reason I live in this neighborhood, colored neighborhood, Mr. Dadier. Now, folks don't care who fix up their car, black or white, just so long as it's fixed good. You're late, boy. I'll be early tomorrow night. This one needs a new set of spark plugs. They'll pick it up at 9:00. Ok. You think we got a good school, Mr. Dadier? Yes. Do you really think that? The important thing is, do you want to learn? In the beginning, I tried...Real hard, but what's the use? Nobody gives a hoot-- not the other fellas, not the teachers, not my folks even. So you quit trying. That's the easy way out, Miller. That's the only way. Sometimes we've got to do what's best, even though that might be the more difficult way. We're talking from different sides of the fence, Mr. Dadier. You're not black. That's not a good enough excuse, not nowadays, and you know it, Miller. And Dr. Ralph Bunche proved that. George Washington carver, Marian Anderson, Joe Louis. So? So I don't want you to quit. That's all. Now, you'll be of age the end of this term. Don't give up trying, Miller. Don't quit. Mr. Dadier, you're pretty new at this. Soon you're gonna be quittin' yourself. All right, look, I'll make a deal with you. We'll have sort of a pact, you and I: Neither of us quit. How about it? Say, now, that wasn't true, what you said about teachers. Some of us do care, you know? Good night. Good night. [Siren] They just took her to the hospital, emergency. I just dropped in to lend a little somethin'. Who? What happened? Your missis, I mean. She started to have terrible pains, just terrible! Ahead of time! 7 months! Oh, don't worry, Mr. Dadier, I'll bring her things! Ooh. [Ding ding ding] Oh. Been here long? Yes, quite a while. Is she gonna be all right? She's fine, Mr. Dadier. You're sure? Yes, your wife is fine. She just had a boy. Well, what do you mean had? Well, he's still in danger. I don't understand. Well, the baby was premature. That, together with-- what was your wife worried about, Mr. Dadier? She seemed to be mentally disturbed. She wouldn't talk about it. Oh, she lost a baby once. No, no. No. I know about that. No. This was something secret. There was no trouble between you and your wife, Mr. Dadier? I'm sorry. Is the baby going to live? I don't know. 3 or 4 days should tell us that. Does Anne-- I mean... Have you told Anne about the baby yet? Mind if I see her? Well, she's still in a twilight condition, not fully awake or fully asleep, but... All right, you can see her. Thank you. Arthur! Hi. Hi. You--are you all right? Tired. Just awfully tired. I think I could sleep for a week. Yeah. Look, honey, you try and get some sleep, huh? No, don't go. Not yet. Wait until they chase you. It happened kind of suddenly. We made it this time, didn't we? Yeah. Have you seen the baby yet? No. No, I haven't. It's a boy, isn't it? Yeah. Happy, Rick? Sure. Still love me? Oh, Anne, I love you. Look, I love you very, very much. I brought these things for Mrs. Dadier. Thank you. Mrs. Brophy... Thanks a lot for all of your trouble. Trouble, mister? What do men know about trouble? I found these letters on the floor. I guess she was reading them when the pain started. I don't understand you, mister. I just don't understand you. [Ding ding ding] It's a necktie, a gift from the kids. Merry Christmas. The kids were only trying to show their appreciation of what you did for them. Yeah? Well, I'd like to give them something for what they did to me. The show was a big success tonight. Miller and his boys sang beautifully! I don't want to hear about it, Jim. I don't... I don't want to hear about the show, about the school, about Miller, about anything 'cause I'm through. I'm finished. I'm quittin'. As far as I'm concerned, that school is just dead. What was it you called it, huh? Was it a great big garbage can, huh? Yeah? Oh, man, how right you were. Well, I've had it right up to here. I'm quitting. I'm getting another job 10 miles and 3,000 delinquents away from here. No, no. No, I was the one that was wrong. You proved something. The kids in our school can be taught if you don't stop trying. You got through to them. And those same kids, when they came into my class, a little of your momentum carried over, and all of a sudden, I wanted to get through to them, too. Hey, that was a big day for me. If I could have 2 days a week like-- you can have it. You can have it. Just remember what you told me. What was it? "Don't turn your back on 'em." Huh? Now, look, if you quit here, you'll quit at the next school, too, then you'll quit teaching altogether. So what? Who cares, Jim? Who--who cares? You think the kids care, their parents care? Who cares about teachers anyhow? Look, I want to show you something, Jim, I wrote down. Now, just listen to this. Teachers get $2.00 an hour, right? Now, listen, "a congressman and a judge "are $9.25 an hour. "Policemen and firemen, $2.75 an hour. "Carpenter, 281. Plumber, 2.97. Plasterer, 3.21." You know, a household cook gets more money than we do, and they get room and board. Oh, yes, I know, a teacher, they get as much as a babysitter or a soda jerk. $2.00 an hour for a teacher. Radio announcer: We take you now to Times Square in New York. In a few moments, the new year will be officially born. Come in, Times Square. [Party horns blowing] Hi. Thank you. You feeling all right? Now that you're here. What's the matter? What? Nothing. Is it about the baby? I didn't see the doctor, Anne. He was busy, and-- announcer: Happy new year. [Turns off radio] I'm scared, Anne. I'm really scared. What if the baby doesn't live? He will. I know he will. Well, what if he doesn't, hmm? You know, I wanted that baby. I needed that baby just as much as you did because all my life, I wanted to teach kids, and my son was gonna-- he was gonna kind of help me, you know? Through him, maybe I'd learn to understand. Rick. Hmm? No matter what happens, I love you. I was silly and vain and selfish, so I doubted you. I was like one of the bad kids in your class-- somebody told a lie, and I believed that lie. Now, one's as bad as the other. Listen, I want to tell you something-- I was wrong about something else, too. I wanted you to quit teaching in that school. I understand now why you wanted to keep trying. Please. I'm glad you didn't quit. Now, wait a minute. Honey, kids are people, and most people are worthwhile. We all need the same thing-- Patience, understanding, love. You've got that to give them, darling, and that's why you'll get through to them. [Knock on door] Your son's out of danger.

Ha ha ha! West. You talkin' to me, teach? Bring your paper up here, west. What for? I said bring your paper up here. And I said what for. Ah, come on, Artie, bring him the paper. Now, look, you just keep your rotten mouth out of this, black boy. Richard: Miller! Hold it. All right. All right, Miller. It's all right. Now bring your paper up here, west. All right. All right, we're going down to see the principal. We are? You gonna make me, daddy-o? Come on, let's go. How'd you like to go to hell? What's the matter, daddy-o? Yeah, how about it, teach? You've got a big mouth, tellin' me to do this, do that. Well, are you big enough to take me down to the principal's office? 'Cause that's just what you're gonna have to do. You're gonna have to take me. Well, come on, take me! Come on! Come on. For a bright boy, you didn't learn nothin'. Well, take me down. Come on. Step right up and taste a little of this, daddy-o. Give me that knife, west. Where do you want it? You want it in the belly? How about in the face, huh? Give me that knife. Here it is. All you got to do is take it. Now, come on! Come on! Take it. Come on. Take it easy, chief. He's crazy. He's high. He's floatin' on sneaky Pete wine. He's gonna kill him. All you've got to do is take it. Come on, take it. That's just what I'm gonna do, big shot. Oh! Come on, west. Come on. Come on. Where you goin', boy? Come on. Belazi. Come on. Morales. Stoker! Santini! Miller: You keep out of this. You want a gang fight? You want to start a rumble? Come on, boy, just make a move. West: All right, you guys. I said, all right! Move, move! What's the matter, west, you need help? Come on. You're holding the handle of that knife. Come on, you're the leader. You're the tough guy, huh? You can't cut it alone, huh, west? You're not so tough without a gang to back you up, are you, west? But you were tough that night in that alley, weren't you? 7-2, that's about your odds, isn't it? Only this time, you get cut up here. The gang-up didn't work. Then you went to the principal with that story about race prejudice. You couldn't get rid of me that way, then you started sendin' those foul letters to my wife, didn't you? Didn't you, west? End of the line, boy. Oh! You--you--you! Not here. No, not here, Mr. Dadier. Not here! Not here. Hey! Belazi! Shut up, chicken! I'm gettin' outta here. I'm not goin' to that reform school! Not me. Me, me, what about me? You, you're on your own. Open up! You hear me? Out of the way! What's the matter with you guys? What do you got against me? Come on! Out of the way, you hear me? Ah! Oh! West: Morales! Use it. Use it. [Clank] That's some cut. We'll take you to a doctor. We'll get you fixed up, teach. After we take these two to the principal's office. All right, fellas? Dadier: I know. You're saying why do that, huh? Why not forget-- forget the whole thing? No! No, no, not this time. There's no place for these two in your classroom. Look, we've all made a step forward this morning. Now, there's no sliding back now, not ever again. Now, whether you like it or not, I'm taking these two downstairs. I think maybe we can give you a hand, Mr. Dadier. Ok, fellas? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. No. I think--I think they'll go along. Come on, west, let's go! Belazi! Come on! What made you change your mind? They did. You ok, Mr. Daddy-o, sir? I think so, Santini. I think so. Mr. Dadier! [Jangle] 87 cents so far. Well, thanks, Miller. Thanks for everything. It's ok, chief. There's talk you're quittin' this school, going someplace where there's nice, little obedient boys and girls. Now, what do you think? Oh, I figure it's just talk. Why? Well, you know the ropes around here pretty good now and it would be a shame to waste all that. I guess everybody learns something in school. Even teachers. Yes, I guess so. Besides, it would be kind of rough breakin' in somebody new. Well, see you tomorrow, Mr. Dadier? I thought you were quitting at the end of the year, is that right? Well, we have a pact. We wouldn't want to break that. No, I--I guess we wouldn't. Well... See you around.
