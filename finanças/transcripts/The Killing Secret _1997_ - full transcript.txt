You gonna hook up with Nicole? Guess again. No, don't tell me. You slay me, man. I can't even get a girlfriend, and you've got two. If Nicole finds out, you're gonna be roadkill. Never happen, dude. I'm way too smooth. So how come I never met this secret sex machine? She lives in Vernon. She goes to Palace High. Consider it charity work for the poor. [P.J.] Women are right, men are dogs.

When am I gonna meet your family, Greg? We've been together almost four months. I love you, you love me. You know that I've never even been to your house? Seems like we never go anywhere but here. Hey, Emily, come on. Come on. You do love me, don't you, Greg? You making it sound like we're engaged to be married or something. Look, all we're saying is get some kind of commitment before graduation. At least get him to agree that you're not gonna date other people once you go off to college. What do you want me to do, sign some sort of contract? If you don't grab him now, some college girl will. Believe me, Greg Dunleavy is not going to last long at (mumbling) I need to know that you love me, that you'll stand by me as life goes on and changes happen. What sort of changes do you have in mind? Sometimes life takes you by surprise. That's not always a bad thing. It can be a really good thing when two people love each other. What are you talking about? What kind of surprise are you talking about? (melancholy music) You're kidding, right? Please, please, tell me you're kidding. Greg and I have been dating for two years. If it was meant to be, then it will last past graduation, and if it wasn't meant to be, then it wasn't meant to be. [Greg] I can't believe this. I can't believe this. It's not that bad, is it, Greg? We're gonna have a baby. Not that bad? Do you think I'm gonna marry you or something? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, don't worry, I'm not gonna abandon you, alright? I'm gonna be responsible about this. Does anyone else know about this but us? Okay, good. We should probably just keep this quiet. Don't you think? Okay. I'm gonna take care of everything. We can drive down to a clinic in Charlotte, and I will pay for everything, okay? Pay for everything? [Greg] Yeah. What's that supposed to mean? You said you were pregnant, so... No, Greg. What I said was we're gonna have a baby. I am not being naive. You are, Nicole. Oh! (laughing) Sorry. Oh, I'm so glad you could stop laughing long enough to tell me that. I'm sorry. (laughing) Took her out. Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch. You're being ridiculous. If you will just think about what you're saying for a minute. Think about it? Greg, it's all I think about. I kind of hoped you might have been a little more supportive. But you're not gonna change my mind. It'll work out, I promise. We're gonna have a baby, Greg. We can build a life together.

It's time for the old people to go to bed. (laughing) But before we go up, I wanna make sure that my son gets his birthday present. Greg, I hope you haven't been drinking tonight because I'm certain you don't wanna be dropping these in the pool. [Girl] Oh, wow. [Girl] So lucky. (applauding) Did you know about this? Maybe. Yeah, I did. Dad, this is incredible. I don't know what to say. I can ask you all to raise your glasses to my son, Greg. Your new set of wheels will be taking you off to Chapel Hill in just a few short months. I want you to keep in mind that same set of wheels will bring you right back home after college should you choose to return. I'm very proud of you, son. You've got a great competitive spirit and I see a great deal of success and achievement in your future. Happy birthday, son. [All] Happy birthday. Hey, let's get some cake. You guys wanna get some cake? [All] Yeah. (tense music) What, are you stalking me now? Is it your birthday? Is that what's going on? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spoil your party. Look Greg, I know this is hard for you, trying to fit me in with your life and friends and all, but when this baby is born and you see that little face smiling up at you... Listen. Listen, maybe we can reach some sort of agreement, alright? Some kind of cash settlement or something. Cash settlement? I'm willing... Is that what you think this is about? Greg, this baby's gonna be born and raised in this town. Now do you want to tell your parents or should I? Greg. The child needs to know who it's father is. (melancholy music) (chattering) (clapping) Make a wish, son. [Girl] Make a wish, Greg. (cheering) (chattering) It's so hard to imagine. I've never sat and stared out at this lake so many times. It's just weird to think that soon none of us will even be here anymore. You think you'll moved back here after college? I don't know. I'm sure your dad will want you to. I mean Dunleavy Development's gonna need another Dunleavy someday, right? It's not such a bad place, Tarrington. I can see moving back here someday. I still can't decide between Duke and Chapel Hill. I mean they're both such good schools. You don't have to yet. Yeah, I guess. Hey, you okay? Yeah. Are we okay? Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm just kinda distracted with something. No, we're fine, we're good. Hey Emily, it's me. Yeah listen, we need to talk, okay? Why don't I meet you on the corner by the movie theater in about 20 minutes. Fine, see you then. So, you know what you want, you want to wait a minute? No, I'll have a cheeseburger, french fries and root beer. Miss? Yeah? I'm sorry about the other night. I'm the brat that spilled iced tea on you. That. Shoot, don't worry about that. That's an occupational hazard. (laughing) Order up. Okay. Okay. No one has to know about this but us, right? We can go down to that clinic in Charlotte. We'll do it this weekend. Just tell my father... You don't seem to understand Greg. I'm gonna have this baby. I'm gonna raise it and I'm gonna love it, and there's nothing you can say that's gonna change... You don't seem to understand Emily. Do you think that I'm gonna sit here and watch my entire life get flushed down the toilet, huh? I mean is that what you really think? Do you have any idea what my father would say if he found out about this? I mean, gee. Uh, congratulations Dad but your illegitimate grandson, well he's gonna be raised in that slum across town. I mean, come on okay? Is that all you care about? Is what your father thinks? Let's get it over with, then. I'll tell him myself. [Greg] Emily. [Emily] Going right now. Hey, Emily.

There's that waitress, remember? The mother of the missing girl, Tina DeCapprio said her daughter was last seen five days ago... What happened? Her daughter disappeared. [Sharon] That's terrible. Was just a few weeks shy of graduation when police say she mysteriously disappeared. Authorities are asking anyone with any information on the whereabouts of Emily DeCapprio... [Greg] Okay, boring. Greg, I was watching that. I'm sorry, honey. It's the rule of the jungle. Men rule the remote. Oh, please. Hey is anybody hungry? You hungry? Hey, Betty, could you make us some sandwiches please? [Girl] Want some more? [Boy] Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. Hi, Mom. [Liz] Hey darling. What's for dinner? I'm starving. Oh, I forgot to tell you. It's Cal's father's birthday and we're taking the kids there for dinner. They can't wait to help their grandpa blow out the candles. Come on guys, let's go. You're welcome to come if you want. No, that's fine. Here, take this one. Take that on out. I'm sorry I thought I told you. There's pasta salad in the fridge. Got it. Have fun. Yeah. [Man On TV] Won't be certain until the results of the autopsy are in. It's very important to try to remember everything. A missing child is perhaps the cruelest form of punishment that any mother can bear and to look in Tina DeCapprio's eyes tells of that anguish. Cards and letters continue to pour into Tina from friends and strangers alike most reading simply, "Emily come home." [Nicole] Hi, is Tina here? No, she's not working tonight. Oh well, I owe her this card. Could you give it to her? Why don't you bring it by her house? You just go up to Brock and it's about a mile or so up the road. You'll see it where all the cars are parked. Okay, thanks. Hey, brat! You're the one aren't you? The one that spilled the iced tea? Yeah, I don't want to disturb you. I just wrote you a card. I left it in the mailbox. Well don't run off. I just came out to get some fresh air you know? I mean all those people. It's nice to know that people care but they look at me with such pity I think I should comfort them. Cigarette? Oh no, I don't smoke. Oh, good for you. Don't start. You'll end up like me. You know, Emily, she won't even let me smoke in the house, you know? Are you friend of hers? No, I go to Tarrington. I just heard about what happened in the news and well, I wrote you the card. That's sweet. Senior, right? Yeah. Yeah, you look to be about her age. Must be exciting. Never graduated myself. I got pregnant, got married. Dumped the husband but I love those kids. What's your name? Nicole. Nicole. That's pretty. I'm Tina. Yeah, I know. Nicole, could I ask you to do a favor for me? Sure. Great. I've got posters up all over town, everywhere from here to Cranston. I was thinking that maybe you could take some, you know, over to Tarrington High? Maybe somebody there knows something. Oh wow. She's really pretty. Yeah. You'll have to pardon the mess. Emily's been trying to teach me how to sew. Good thing she's a patient girl. I said we're gonna put in one hour and the next thing you know it's midnight and we're still yakking away. It's nice that you guys are so close. Well, you know how mothers and daughters are.

And she was pretty too. I mean, she she is pretty. It's not like she's dead or something. [Greg] I don't know.

The state and federal authorities are up to date, and just as soon as we hear anything at all... Wait, what are you talking about? Wrapping things up? Ms. DeCapprio over 850,000 kids are reported missing in this country every year, and a vast majority of them have simply run away from home, especially girls her age. Now we've talked with her friends at school, We've spoken on the phone with Greg Dunleavy. There's just not much more the police can do. Have you contacted all her friends personally? Just about. (doorbell ringing) Hello. I'm looking for Greg Dunleavy. Is this the right house? Yes, come in. Greg's out back. Why don't you have a seat? Can I get you something? No, I'm fine, thank you. (chattering) Greg! Someone's here to see you. [Greg] Be back in a second. I'm sorry, there's no smoking in this house. What is it you want to see Greg about? It's personal. You a friend of his? Not really. Hi, Ms. DeCapprio. Greg. I'm really sorry about what's happened. I've been meaning to come by and see you. It's just, you know, things have been so crazy with graduation and finals coming. Oh yeah. You really can't wait to get me out of here, can you? You know, it's odd Greg, but I don't think Emily's ever met any of your friends. As a matter of fact, I don't think she's ever been in this house, has she? For a close relationship, you've really kept her stashed away. Oh, we haven't really been seeing each other that long, Ms. DeCapprio, so we just kind of spent most of our time alone. Yes, I'm sure you did. Look, I'll be brief. I've talked to all of her friends in Vernon. They don't have a clue. I just need to know if you have any idea of what happened. No, not really. There was this, this one thing a couple of weeks ago. We were riding in the car together, and this song came on the radio about running away from home and Emily said, "Maybe that's what I'll do. "Maybe I'll run away." Well, did she say anything else, like where she would go or who she would go with? No, no, she never mentioned it again. She just said, "Maybe I'll run away from home." And I never really gave it much thought. Alright. Well, I won't torture you any longer. Look Greg, just promise me if you hear anything you'll give me a call. - Of course. - Tina. What are you doing here? Do you guys know each other? Does this does have something to do with Emily? Excuse me, I'm in the wrong neighborhood. Greg, what's going on? Well, she... Tina, wait a minute. Tina. Tina, stop. Talk to me. What's going on? I'm sorry, Nicole. I just have bigger things on my mind right now than the love life of rich kids. What? Tina what is going on? What do you think is going on? Greg was seeing Emily, okay? Your boyfriend was cheating on you. Welcome to the real world. (tense melancholy music) (pop music) (chattering) I have no clue! Excuse me, sir, what do you think you're doing? [Man] What am I doing? That was the question. I'm working for God. What are you doing? Okay, we're going to have to... this is school property, son. I don't pay any attention to your... I've seen that guy around. He's always panhandling in the park. Must be from another planet, I guess. (siren blipping) This whole town's looking for Emily. [Officer] Alright, break it up. Crazy people. Right this way, thank you, officer. (mumbling) Okay, kids. Get back to class. [Officer] Let's go, let's go. [Man] Let me get my cart. [Officer] Yeah, no. [Man] Let me get my cart. [Officer] Keep moving. (bell ringing) Hey come on, just talk to me for two minutes. Greg, there's nothing left to say. (chattering) He really misses you, Nic. So what, I'm supposed to feel sorry for him? You guys are so good together. Yeah well, it isn't me who screwed it up, is it? Nicole. Sharon, he lied to me. Every time we were together he was lying to my face. I don't see how I'm supposed to just get over that like it's no... Nic, please. I'll talk to you later, okay? Give me a second okay? Let me, let me tell you how sorry I am. Okay, you're sorry. Have a nice life. Nic, it wasn't a big thing with Emily. I had only taken her out a couple of times. Really? Just give me a few minutes tonight, please. I can't, I'm busy. Nicole! Actually I'm volunteering for a search party tonight. We'll be looking for your other girlfriend. Somebody said they saw her near the woods by the old mill. (bell ringing) I wanna thank you all for volunteering your time and energy this evening. We're gonna spread out about eight feet apart, form a single line and walk due east. Everyone move nice and slow and keep your eyes wide open. But before we go why don't we join hands for a moment for a short prayer. Dear Lord, we're here to search for Emily tonight but we ask that our search prove fruitless, for we pray that Emily is safe and sound and will be returned to us shortly. Amen. Okay, let's spread out. Move nice and slow and keep your eyes wide open. Let's go. Single line eight feet apart. (melancholy music) I'm glad that we did the search. I think it's for the best that we didn't find her. I guess you're right. Hey. Hey. [Man] If there's anything that we can do at all, just give me a ring. [Tina] I appreciate that. [Man] Goodnight. Goodnight. I'm sorry about making a scene the other day. It's okay. It's better that I know the truth. How are you doing? It's getting harder and harder, you know? Every night alone at home waiting for the phone and I don't know. Maybe she did run away from home. I know she was depressed the last few weeks and I couldn't get her to talk about it. Maybe if I tried harder, just reached out... No, no. Thanks for coming, Nicole. It really means a lot to me. Do you need a lift home? No, no. I came with the neighbors. Take care. Oh, graduation right, Saturday night? Yeah. Congratulations. Thanks. So, we were just walking off the ninth hole and guess who we run into? The Dunleavys. So, we walked the clubhouse to get a drink. The men start talking business and before you know it, Ted Dunleavy has agreed to finance Cal's new condominium project. That's great. Well, it's not a done deal yet, but it looks really good. Maybe you could get Greg to put in a good word with his old man. Greg and I aren't seeing each other anymore. Excuse me? Things weren't working out so I broke it off. Why would you do that? Because things weren't working out. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Nicole. Nicole, honey listen. Whatever happened I'm sure you can patch it up. I'm sure if you just apologized, Apologize? He'd forgive you. What makes you so certain it was something that I did? I didn't say that. I'm just, I'm just trying to help. Thanks a lot, Mom. You've been very helpful, as usual.

How do you want me to believe anything that you're saying? Just give me another chance, Nic. Please. I got you something. What's that supposed to mean? It means I love you. It means I miss you. It means I want you to come to Chapel Hill with me next year so we can be together forever. I really miss you, Nic. I miss you, too. [Greg] God, I love you so much. I love you so much. (chattering) Just one kiss, P.J., that's all. We'll see about that. Okay, let's see what you can do. (laughing) (mellow pop music) What is that? (tense music) Oh my God. (screaming) It's that girl.

The police have any leads or anything? The paper said the body's being sent to Charlotte for an autopsy. Poor Tina. Before we begin Ms. DeCapprio asked me to announce that the family will be receiving at their home this evening between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. for all who wish to pay their condolences personally. Now that we've all taken our seats, the service can begin. I don't know, maybe I should just wait out here. Greg. This is just feels kind of weird Nic, you know? I mean, going in there with you. Everybody knows I was seeing Emily. I don't want to hear this. Ms. DeCapprio hates my guts as it is. We're here to offer condolences. Leave everything else out of it. She's not even here. Let's just go. Wait. I know where she is. Tina? I needed a cigarette, and Emily won't let me smoke in the house, so... We both wanted to offer our condolences. I'm really sorry about what happened. Thanks, Greg, I appreciate that. Sure. How's Andy doing? You know, it's hard to tell. He keeps everything so bottled up but he's decided he wants to go home with his dad for the summer and under the circumstances it's probably for the best. I'm gonna give you guys a minute or two. I'll wait in the car. So you took him back? He was really sorry. What could I say? Well, you could have said what I said when I found out my husband was running around. Sorry's good but it's not good enough. You know, Nicole women weren't just put on this earth to say and do and dress the way men want them to. It's an important lesson for a girl to learn. Well, I hope that's not what I do. (melancholy music) You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to take some flowers down to the lake where they found her and then plant some flowers for Emily. Could you do that with me? I'd love to. Thank you. It seems all of Tarrington turned out Saturday to say goodbye to Emily, the young girl whose body was found late last week on the shores of Scofield Lake, brutally murdered. It was a somber affair. Family, classmates, strangers alike attended the service where Emily DeCapprio was eulogized as a wonderful girl, senselessly taken in the prime of her... [Greg] Hey. Didn't see you there. (melancholy music) (mumbling) That's it. Oh, I don't want to cry anymore. I've been crying for weeks. Just wanna sit here, hold hands have silence. Moment of silence for Emily. Oh God. (sobbing) I want her back. I want her back. Oh God, I want her back. I just don't understand how anybody could do that. Kill a girl, stuff her in a trash bag, dump her in the middle of a lake. Hell of way to remember our last summer in Tarrington. Well, it's over now. Over? You know that creep is still out there somewhere. Who knows who he'll get next. Oh, thanks, Kim. That'll help us sleep tonight. You know, there's just one thing that I don't understand. Why did you tell Tina that you thought Emily ran away? That's what she said she was planning to do. Yeah, maybe she did run away. Maybe she was hitchhiking out of town and she got picked up by some serial killer or something. You've sure been spending a lot of time with that woman lately. We're friends. That just seems kind of weird. I mean all of a sudden you're off hanging out in Vernon. She's poor, Sharon. That's where she lives. It's not like everybody that lives in Vernon is a criminal. Whatever. You know, I just don't see what you two have in common. I don't know. Maybe I remind her of Emily. What do you think, Greg? Do I remind you of Emily? Nicole. (tense melancholy music) You wanna go for a swim? No, I think I'm just gonna go home. [Bill] Are you Greg Dunleavy? [Greg] Yeah. Detective Phil Rodlauer. This is Detective Connie Lang. [Greg] How are you doing? [Phil] we're gonna need to talk to you for a few minutes. Phil, what's going on? Sorry to bother you, Mr. Dunleavy. We're gonna need Greg for a while down at the station. Now? But it's almost dinnertime. Phil, we're just about to sit down for dinner. How about I give you a call later on? We can talk about this. I think it'd be best if he came down now. It's the Emily DeCapprio situation. There've been some developments. You're welcome to come if you like. You can follow us down in your own car. (tense music) (chattering on police radio) Do you know what's going on? The police just came and got Greg. They said something about a new development. Mmm, they performed an autopsy in Charlotte. Results just came back. And? Well, she wasn't drowned. Her lungs were still full of air. That's why she floated up to the surface like that. Apparently she'd been killed somewhere else. Strangled, then dumped in a lake an hour so after death. Phil, can we get to the point here? The coroner discovered another surprise. She was pregnant. Oh my God. About six weeks. See, it all makes sense now. That's why she was acting so worried. I knew something was on her mind but I could not get her to talk to me about it. The baby was Greg's. No. So you had no idea at all? No, she didn't say a thing. I mean, we weren't really all that close. We were just kind of hanging out. It wasn't a real big deal. Her mother, Tina, she seemed to think it was a very big deal. She said you were the only boy Emily was sexually involved with. Well... There was nothing casual about this. She loved Greg. She thought they'd get married someday. The baby was his and he panicked. He was desperate, backed into a corner. Tina, what are you saying? Are we in some kind of trouble here, Phil? Should I be looking for a lawyer? I just wanted to discuss this quietly before it spread like wildfire. There's no evidence yet it was even Greg's baby, aside from what Tina DeCapprio is saying. And what else is Ms. DeCapprio saying? I have tried to hold my tongue but I can't any longer. Too many things are starting to add up. Why didn't he ever come and see me while she was missing? And why was he so uncomfortable at the funeral? He wouldn't look me in the eye. And that that whole story about her planning to run away. Emily wouldn't do that. Not six weeks pregnant. She, she got pregnant and he panicked. No, no, Greg couldn't do this. It's not possible. He did it. He strangled my baby with his bare hands and then he dumped her body in the middle of that lake like a piece of garbage. He did it, Nicole. Greg murdered Emily. (melancholy music) No. (chattering) I hate this. Everybody's looking at me. It's like people know everything. You don't have to go in. It's okay as long as you stay close by. Have you been smoking? I've never had a cigarette in my life. You smell like cigarettes. Poor guy, he looks so depressed. Who wouldn't be? Hauled in and accused of murder. And Nicole hanging around with the dead girl's mom all the time. Like it isn't enough problems to deal with. Things sure haven't changed at the old school. Punch is still weak and the band still sucks. Yeah. So, with me the police suspect Greg anyway? They don't suspect him. They just wanted to talk to him. It's Tina DeCapprio that's been pointing fingers. Well, apparently she's saying all kinds of things about Greg to the police. No, she just told them the truth, that Greg was seeing Emily. You know, I don't know why you're defending her Nicole. She's saying Greg's a murderer. And I don't know why you're attacking her, Sharon. You don't even know her. Yeah and you seem to be her best friend. (chattering) He was president of the student council last year and she was council treasurer. Let's welcome Steven Ray and Dori Street. (cheering) Next to the dance floor one of our favorite couples of the graduating class. He was our starting quarterback and she was captain of the cheerleading squad and they're both headed for Chapel Hill this fall. Let's hear it for Greg Dunleavy and Nicole Voss. (cheering) Yeah, I can't believe she has the nerve to go out there and dance with him. Well, give her a break. (chattering) Let's everybody dance and have fun. (uptempo music) ♪ And as sure as there's a sky above ♪ ♪ And fools still searching ♪ ♪ There ain't no rules for love ♪ ♪ That's for certain ♪ ♪ Ain't no rules for love ♪ [Greg] Tina tell you that Emily was pregnant? [Nicole] Yes. Probably best if that didn't get around. You know you probably don't wanna tell Tina this but it could have been any one of a dozen guys. I mean Emily really liked to get drunk and when she got drunk... Greg, she isn't here to defend herself. So what kind of stuff did the police ask you? Normal kinds of stuff. They didn't ask you where you were the night she was killed? Yeah. So where were you? I can't believe you're asking me that. First you cheated on me, then that same girl is found murdered. Now the police... I can't believe what you're saying. Do you really think I could strangle someone, Nicole? Have these hands ever hurt you? I want you to stop seeing Tina DeCapprio. You understand me? She is bitter and she's angry. She's turning you against me. Now, I am fighting for my life here, you understand? And you just better figure out whose side you're on. (melancholy music) (tires squealing) No, thank you. Who the hell does she think she is?` Who, dear? Although Tina DeCapprio has avoided the press, sources say that she has told police bluntly who she suspects committed the crime. A young man from a prominent Tarrington family. (thudding) [Phil] Detective Rodlauer. Hi, I'm Nicole Voss. Yes, I know who you are. What can I do for you, Nicole? I'm very close with Greg Dunleavy. I've known him for many years. I've also recently become friendly with Tina DeCapprio. I just wanted to talk to you and get a sense of where your investigation is going. You know, see if you really think that Greg could've... Murdered Emily? I was thinking of calling you in to ask the exact same question. You've known Greg a while. Has he ever hit you, shown signs of violence? No. [Phil] Good upstanding boyfriend? Yeah. Never cheated, never lied? What do you think Nicole? Do you think he killed her? Of course not. But you wouldn't say it's impossible, would ya? [Connie] Phil. Thanks for stopping by. There you are. You're just in time. Come on we're celebrating. Celebrating what? Cal and Ted just closed the deal. It's so exciting! Don't say anything, okay? [Cal] Look who's here. Nicole. Hello, dear. Could you possibly be more adorable? (laughing) A lot of people are shying away from new home construction. Boy, not me. I say let's keep Tarrington expanding. Yep. Thank you. Especially if you want to have a healthy economy by the time our grandkids are grown up. The way things are going that might not be too long from now. [Ted] Nicole you must be excited about heading off to Chapel Hill in a couple of months huh? Yes, I am. [Ted] Oh, I know Greg sure is. [Rachel] I'm just afraid that he won't return. I mean what with the way the police have been treating him lately. [Liz] Oh, they'll sort that out, don't you think? It'll sort itself out if that DeCapprio woman would just concentrate on waiting tables. Leave the police work to the police. Nicole I understand she's a friend of yours. Yes, she is. Nicole is the kind of girl who's very fond of bringing home stray animals, puppies. (chuckling) [Cal] That's right. Mom, she's not a puppy. She's a woman whose daughter has been murdered. I know that, I know. Nicole, it's a horrible thing that's happened, but she can't just go around telling lies about innocent people, can she? You know I was hoping that maybe you could try and talk some sense into her. I mean since you two are such close friends. (melancholy music) You'll have to excuse me. Nicole. She's upset. Excuse me. Nicole come back. Nicole. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi Nicole. It's Kim. Look I just wanted to let you know there's gonna be a party fourth of July on the lake. North shore by the rowboats. I don't think so. I, I don't think I can. You know, Nicole Greg is going through a very difficult time right now. The least you can do is show some support. He's lied to me before. How do I know that he's not lying to me now? I want to believe him, I do. I just, I just don't know what to do believe. Forget it then. You know, I'm only even telling you because I thought Greg might want you there. You know Sharon and Stacey didn't even want to invite you. (dial tone blaring) I'm not asking for anything unreasonable. My family's been slandered. My son's been falsely accused of murder. Mr. Dunleavy, no one here's accused your son of anything. Oh for heaven sakes, Phil. The entire town is accusing him. You owe us a statement, a letter to the press that fully exonerates Greg of an evil criminal wrongdoing. I'm afraid we can't do that right now. What do you think, Connie? We got enough to make stick? It'll stick. Let's go. (tense music) (thudding) [Cop] Freeze! Get down! On the floor! On your knees, right now! [Phil] Aaron Clemens, you're under arrest for the kidnap and murder of Emily DeCapprio. [Connie] Get him out of here. (rock music) Against my Constitutional rights. This is against the Constitution of the United States of America which was written by Thomas Jefferson, George Washington. You ever read it? Read it, read it. I can paint anything I want. This is America. I can do anything I want. This is fascism, that what (mumbling). (rock music) Jeez. Look at this. Let's get some photos in here. Looks like we found our boy. ♪ Something across the light ♪ Okay, but why Emily? Look, I'm the only person in this room who cares anything about Emily. To you guys she's nothing but another case. To me, she was... His name is Aaron Clemens. He has a long history of mental illness and violent crimes. In fact, he was just released from a correctional mental institution upstate 90 days ago. There was plenty of evidence in his house and he's the one who's been drawing the murals of Emily all over town. It's like he's been crying out to be caught. Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure? Yeah, we're sure. [Phil] Look, you've got her pictures all over your walls. When I take her picture, when I'm painting her pictures, she's still alive. Don't you see that? She's still alive. I'm the only one keeping her alive and there's a killer out there. There's a killer out there who took Emily and it's not me. [Nicole] I'm home. Nicole. Did you hear the news? No, what happened? The police arrested the man who murdered Emily DeCapprio. His name is not Greg Dunleavy. (tense music) [Woman] Taking off, Tina? [Tina] Yeah. [Woman] Okay, you have a good night now, you hear? Okay. Nicole. [Nicole] Hi. Hi, I was gonna call you. I don't know if you heard. Yeah, I did. Police think they got the right guy. I mean, this guy's got a record a mile long and he has the strangest eyes. If you could just look into those eyes. Yeah well, I guess it wasn't Greg after all. Oh, Nicole. I'm so sorry. Tina, I am glad that they found him. I'm just sorry it had to ruin everybody else's life in the process. Oh, Nicole. It was my fault. It was all my dumb suspicions. I mean, I was irresponsible. I apologize. Well, it's over. I'm glad for you. I gotta go. Hey you know I was thinking about going down to the lake later this week to check on Emily's flowers, see how they're doing. Maybe you want to come along? I don't think that's a good idea. Take care. (somber music) (uptempo music) (excited chattering) Look who's here. Guess they must have run out of hot dogs over in Vernon. (laughing) Hey, Nic. Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. I'm sorry. I was confused. There's so much coming at me so fast. Tina is a good person, she is. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have been spending so much time around her. That really hurt Nic, you know? I mean all my friends were totally there for me, everyone but you. We had something special. I thought we loved each other. Greg, I do love you. I do. I messed up. All I can do is ask you to forgive me. I guess that's what love's all about. Forgiveness. Hey. Let's go for a row. [Nicole] Greg. Come on. what better way to celebrate the fourth of July? Greg, it feels weird. Nic, we've been on this thing a hundred times. Yeah, I know but, now it feels like we're playing on someone's grave. Hang on. See? It's the same lake it always was. It just doesn't feel the same. I keep thinking about what happened out here. Something happened. Something happened, but it's over, okay? This is our lake, Nic. We just have to take it back. Greg, no. (cheering) (chattering) (uptempo rock music) You're back. It's good to be back. [P.J.] Beer? We got one right here P.J. [P.J.] Yeah, right. (chuckling) No? No. It was fun for a while but definitely not meant to last. You're so bad. Hey, it's that guy they arrested. (uptempo rock music) (tense music) Weird huh? Our very own murderer. Right here in sleepy little Tarrington. Nicole? Hey! You know, I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm just gonna go home. Have fun. Bye. Hey, Nic. What's up? I'm not feeling very well. I think I'm just gonna go home. Ah, I'll give you a lift. No, it's okay. I'll drive. I'll talk to you later. (uptempo rock music) Detective Rodlauer. You're back. Listen, I saw something on TV. I'm not certain that it was what I think it was, but it may be something very important. [Woman On Speaker] Phil, the DA's are here. [Phil] I'm on my way. I just need a few minutes. Look, I got a lot of work to do. Your boyfriend's in the clear, okay? So just relax with the Nancy Drew routine Go home, have a nice summer vacation. Wait a minute. (phones ringing) (clattering) (tense music) (phone ringing) Hello? What's up? It's Greg. Remember me, your boyfriend that you didn't call after you left the party early? I was worried. How you feelin'? I have a stomachache, cramps or something. Well, I decided to go waterskiing with my family this weekend and we're leaving right after dinner so I'm gonna swing by and see you before I go. No I can't. Come on, Nic. I'm not gonna see you for three whole days. I can't. I have a family thing. You know, it's my mom's birthday. We're all going out to dinner. Okay, okay so I guess I'll see you when I get back. Yeah, call me on Sunday okay? Sure. I love you. You, too. (tense music) [Tina On Phone] Hello? Tina, it's Nicole, I need to talk to you. [Tina On Phone] I've got the dinner shift in half an hour. I'll be back later, okay? It can't wait. I need to talk to you right now. I'm leaving. Wait for me, okay? [Tina On Phone] Okay. (tense music) (knocking) Can I come in? There's a warehouse up on Shattuck Road. It's out in the middle of nowhere, all by itself. Greg's father owns it and he takes me there to be alone sometimes. I guess he takes other girls there, too. I found this there in the back room a couple of days after Emily disappeared. It's the button that was torn from her shirt the night that she died. I know what it is. It means... I know what it means. Oh my God! I took it to Rodlauer but he wouldn't even talk to me. I thought maybe that if you took it to him, he might talk to you. If he did it would be the first time. Nicole I don't know. They've already arrested someone. They've announced it to the press. I mean the last thing in the world the police want to hear is contradictory evidence. If we just had something else to go on. (tense music) The door to the bathroom wouldn't close. What? It wouldn't close right, like it had been broken or something. Maybe there's something else there. Greg's going out of town this weekend. I could go there and I could look around. I could go there tonight. No, tomorrow. I have to work late tonight. We'll go there tomorrow together. Listen to me, Nicole. There's nothing out there that can't wait until tomorrow morning. (tense music) I'll be at work 'til midnight but I'll be home after that, so if you need anything call me. Okay. (tense music) [Man On TV] Can you tell me your friend's name? Take your time. [Woman On TV] Uh, it... (tense music) Hey, Nic. (tense music) Decided not to go down with my parents tonight. I can go tomorrow. Hey, you know maybe you could come with if you're not doing anything this weekend. There is, there is so much I have to tell you. It has been so hard keeping all of this secret. I have done some horrible things, Nic. Really, just horrible things. I know. I want to talk about it. I want to tell you everything. I really do love you, you know that? And when you love someone, I mean really, really love someone, gotta know you can trust them. I mean, really trust them, no matter what. Can I trust you that much, hon? Do you love me that much? What do you mean? We're about to go off to college together, right? We can get married soon. We can share this secret for the rest of our lives and no one listens to anything Tina DeCapprio says, anyway... Greg, no! You can't just send an innocent person to jail. You're gonna have to tell the police, or I will. There's no way out of this. You have to turn yourself in. Turn myself in? Turn myself in? I'll cover my tracks. Those seem to be the only choices I have left here. What is that supposed to mean? Cover your tracks? Look, Nic, sometimes people just have to die, you know? I mean, it's, it may be ugly. It's, it's brutal but that's just the way the world works you know? I mean Emily wasn't a bad person, and I am really, really sorry about what happened to her. Just, why don't you sit down? I don't wanna sit down. (mumbling) sit. Just sit down, okay, please, sit down. What are you gonna do? You gonna kill me too? You think that's gonna solve your problems? Well, it doesn't matter now because now there's evidence. There's hard evidence that you killed Emily. (tense music) Police are gonna have it tomorrow with or without me. You mean this, Nic? (tense music) Why don't you have a drink Nic? Could be a long night. (thunder booming) You can't do this, Greg. You think you can, but you can't. Shut up, Nic. Greg, this is me. You love me. You can't kill somebody that you love. You're not a monster. Wait a minute. It was an accident right? Well, the police will understand that. You didn't mean to do it. You just you just brought her up here to... Oh, God, please tell me it was an accident. (thunder booming) ♪ On and on ♪ It doesn't matter what it was.

Greg Dunleavy, having pleaded guilty to the killing of Emily DeCapprio, you've been convicted by this court on one count of murder in the first degree. You have been sentenced to a term of life in prison, a sentence you will begin serving immediately. Before concluding today, you are required by state law to now face the survivors of your crime and to make a statement. I'm sorry. I did a horrible thing. I killed an innocent girl who didn't deserve to die. I have lied and hurt the people who love me. I didn't know what to do. I didn't, I didn't know who to talk to, or to turn to. I wanted to protect my family, my future. (melancholy music) I did a horrible thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (melancholy music) (chattering) [Nicole] It's over. Yeah. I want you to meet my mother.
