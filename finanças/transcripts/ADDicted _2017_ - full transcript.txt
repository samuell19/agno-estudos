Oh, yeah, do we impose rules and regulations on those who contribute to politicians and political parties, or do we hold those politicians and political parties to a higher standard?

Good questions, I like the fact that you all stayed awake. I'll have your papers ready to hand back on Monday. Mr. Dawson, a word, please. Be safe, everyone, have fun, not too much. - Sorry about that. - Well, I, I wish it was your less-than-stellar attendance that had me pull you over, but I'm afraid it isn't. Let's see here. Ah, remember this? I rarely give F's, but I'm afraid an act of plagiarism has been committed. - Plagiarism? Yeah, plagiarism, may I? OK, page three.

I could go on and on here.

I, with, uh, school and other classes, and football now, and law school stuff, and some personal matters, I've just been a little overwhelmed. - Well, why didn't you think you could come to me before? - I don't know, I figured you get excuses all the time. - Yeah, you're right, I do. I'll tell you what. This is what we're gonna do. You're gonna hand in a new paper on Monday. One non-cited source, I'm gonna report you for plagiarism, and if you come to my class even one minute late again, I fail you, do you understand? - Yes, sir, I understand. - OK, good, I will see you Monday on time.

Is there somethin' that you'd rather be doin' right now? - No, sir. - Then you wanna tell me why this is the fourth time you lost coverage today?

No, sir. - Then where's your head at? - It's here, sir. - Prove it! You're one of our leaders, Dawson. Freshman can do this shit, but not you. Come on, get your ass back out there. Jake, out, second, Dawson! Let's go, stay sharp! Jesus! Yo, D, yo, what the fuck happened to you today, kid? - I missed a few plays. - A few plays, are you kidding me, man? Tomorrow's a big day, yo, you can't be messin' up like that! - Tomorrow's game day, today's practice. - Come, oh, really, OK. Practice how you play. - Ha ha, you been talkin' to Coach, huh? What you gotta say now? - Aw, man whatever, man. - Yo, come on, just get your head in the game, baby, come on! - I'll be good for tomorrow. - All right, whatchu doin' right now, whatchu doin'? You wanna kick it before dinner? - I wish, I can't. I gotta go to the student center, write this paper. - You gonna do that now? - I have to, teacher's on me about it. - A'ight, yo, you think we can get a few more addies? - I'm kinda runnin' low. - Come on, man, just a couple more. You saw the game I had last week. - Uh, one time. - Really, you gonna do it or no? - Yeah, I'm gonna do it. - All right, thank you, man. - We gotta win tomorrow. How many-- Two, just two, yeah, two's good. All right, thanks a lot, bro. I appreciate this, man, I really do. - Well, good. - You good, though, man, you good? You wanna talk or anything? - Nah, I just gotta get on this paper. - A'ight, kid, yo, holler at me if you want a break, a'ight? - Ah, see ya at dinner. - I'll bust that ass at Call of Duty! - OK, so they go back to his place after dinner, and before you know it, they're making out on the couch. After a while, he gets up to go to the bathroom, and she realizes, you know, if their make out sesh is gonna continue onto the bedroom, then she needs to take her extensions out, you know? So she unsnaps them and she hides them under the couch cushions. So, you know, the next morning, she gets up. She goes to class and she's like, "Oh my God, I forgot my extensions!" And she tries to find, like, any excuse to come over after class that day, but he's busy, so it's not a go, so she figures no way anyone's ever gonna find them, right? Well, he invites her over to drink with him and his roomies last night, and what does his friend, Joe, wearing on his head when she walks in, oh, yes, the extensions. - Oh my God! - They all end up getting drunk together, and they just, like, burn them in the backyard. So bad, it's like-- - Oh my God, is that Drew? - Um, yeah, OK. You should go talk to him. - OK. - You really should. You need to make it better! - Is this-- - You look so good. I'm nervous. - Don't be nervous, you've been dating him for a year! You're fine, good luck! - I know. - I'll see you back at the house. OK. - Hey. Kristen and I were coming from class and I saw you. Thanks for blocking me on Facebook. I really miss you, Drew. - If I do what you did, and hooked up with my ex-girlfriend, you wouldn't even be talking to me. - Drew, please. I messed up, I know. Look, I'm not blaming it on alcohol, but with all the older girls in town for Homecoming, every time I turned around, there was a shot waiting for me, and as soon as I sobered up, I got out of his car hating myself. - Ashley, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear it anymore. All right? Doesn't the last year mean anything to you? - Does it to you? - Babe, I love you so much! You are my world, I would do anything, anything to take back what I did, but I can't. - Can we not do this now? I really, I really gotta write this paper. - Drew, please! Ashley, I'm. Speaking of papers, have you told your mom about us? I can't really risk her getting mad at me and then jeopardize the paper I'm writing on her for class, you know. - Yeah, don't worry, I didn't tell her. I gotta get back to this. - Is everything OK? I feel like there's something else bothering you. If it's me, look, I get it, I'll go. - It's nothing. - Drew, you can talk to me. It's OK. - You can't tell anyone. - OK. - I mean it! - I don't want you runnin' your mouth at the newspaper or your sorority, OK? - I promise you, I won't! - My teacher thinks I plagiarized this paper. - Are you serious? Yeah. Did you? - No, of course not, I just forgot about it until a few days before it was due, and I rushed it, so I forgot a couple of sources. - So are you in trouble? - He's giving me to Monday to rewrite it, but he said if I'm late one more time, he'll report the plagiarism and then I'm, I'm done with football. - Do you want some help? How? - I could rewrite it for you. - No, he already thinks I cheated. Besides, what do you know about the history of campaign finance reform? - By Monday, I'll know plenty! Just give me your notes and your book and anything you've written, and I'll go from there. You know how many paper's I've written for the girls in the house. - I'm just gonna do some more research, be more careful, and get it done, but thanks. - OK. I mean, if you think you can do that, plus your game and practice, and everything else you've gotta do, then by all means! - Hey, if I agree to this, by no means does it mean we're back together or that I forgive you. All right, here, this is my book. It's the first couple of chapters, and I have some notes in here and I'll email you the rest. - Um, just one more thing. If I have any chance in hell at finishing this paper as well as my sociology paper and the newspaper and social chair stuff, I'm gonna need a little bit of help. - How many? - Eight, 10. 10? - Well, I mean, do you want it done? I should be asking for the whole bottle! - Oh, shit! - Pss, gimme those, too! - Look, Monday, 7:50 a.m. at A&S building, not a minute late. - OK, I got this. Good luck tomorrow. - Awesome win, fellas, awesome win! Thanks. - AJ, can I get a round of Fireballs? - Yo, y'all are crazy, man. Hey, bring it in, though, man, I love it!

These are serious things, they have nothing to do with the class, but they're important to me. - Can I speak to you for a minute. - Sure. Uh, I'm just gonna be a sec, you guys, but this is important. It has to do with all you Cards fans out there. Drew. - I know you're not gonna believe me, but I swear I had this paper on me when I left my house this morning, and I didn't realize until I got here that I don't. I can go home and get it and be back in, like, 10 minutes. - What did I tell you last week? To have it in by eight a.m. - And if you didn't? - And then if I didn't, you'd fail me. - Well, there you go. I-I-I'm sorry, I gave you a second chance, which is more than most of my colleagues woulda done. I know, sir, but I had -- - Drew, I-I'm sorry. - Please! - I have a class to teach. - Sir, sir! - I have a class to teach. Can't you just give me, I can go home and get the paper. - Are you listening? I need you to step aside. - Please, sir! - I need you to step aside. Step aside. - I, I have the paper! - I'm sure you do. I need you to hear me right now, OK? This is on you. Sir! I'm terrible at speeches, so bear with me. If you haven't heard already, I'm suspended for the rest of the season. The dean of my school accused me of plagiarism, and so now I'm out. I made some stupid decisions and was, was careless, and now, my actions aren't just affecting me, but I hurt the entire team, and I'm sorry. I can't play or practice, but I'll be supportin' you guys from the sidelines, and I promise I'm gonna do everything in my ability to be back on the field for the bowl game, it's my number one priority. Most of you know my dad never got a chance to play in a bowl game while he was here and how much that means to me. I don't wanna bring you guys down off the Mizzou win, so just keep that momentum goin'. I just wish I coulda been out there with you guys. Sorry, MAMU. - MAMU! MAMU, MAMU! - Locker room, c'mon! - Well, this is the first time I'm hearing of this. - And that concerns me. You have to have a newspaper tell you what's going on in your son's life? Your coffee, ma'am. Thank you. Your Merlot, sir. Can I interest you guys in any of our specials today? - Eh, give us a minute, please. Yes, sir. - You understand the ramifications when it comes to race time, right? You realize this will be a huge target on your back. You're like a second daughter to me, but I don't want to, and I will not, waste any more of my money if you don't stand a chance in the primaries. - Believe me, Elliot, I'm gonna take care of this. - Anything and everything is ammunition, Kate. You need to, to explain this to him clearly! Unfortunately, we're a nation of headline readers, and the public will believe anything they're told. - Well, if it gets dirty, we'll fight back. - Do you know how much more that will cost? Preventing things like this is the answer. Look, your father was a great attorney and one of the hardest workers I have ever had the privilege of doing business with, but you and I both know what he had in ambition and acumen, he lacked in responsibility as a father and a husband. His career completely consumed him. You cannot be like that with Drew, not now. - Trust me, nothing like this will ever occur again, but I need to know you're still with me. You have my word, but if this happens again-- - It won't, it will not. Plagiarism, are you kidding me? Mom, I promise, I didn't mean to-- - Do you have any idea what this little act almost cost me? My entire campaign could've been derailed because of this! I'm in the national public eye now. Your screw-ups are my screw-ups, what the hell were you thinking about? - I'm sorry, Mom, I just, this semester, it's been killing me. I, I was falling a little behind, and I, I, I guess I got a little sloppy. - Plagiarism? - Mom, I didn't commit plagiarism. - It's a little bit more than getting a little sloppy, Andrew! Jeez! Are you taking your medication? Of course. - Well, if you're falling behind, then maybe you ought to talk to Dr. Stephens. I suggest maybe, maybe upping your dosage. Honey, you're severely hurting your own career here! Do you understand, I mean, I have a lotta pull at certain law schools, but it's not gonna do much good if you can't meet me halfway. - I'm gonna retake the class, and they'll average both the grades, and besides, I already have a 3.4. - Above average. That's what you wanna settle for, above average? Mediocrity, Andrew, is for middle management. Does this family look like middle management to you? I want you filling out these applications before you go, and I registered you for those LSAT classes. They start in January. Mom! - What, you wouldn't do it, so I had to! Andrew, maybe it's a good thing you got suspended from football! So you can start focusing on what really matters. Let's be honest, you don't have a future in football, you have a guaranteed career in a firm that your grandfather was a founding partner of! I mean, most people, they would just kill for that chance! - I'm trying. - Try harder. I want you studying immediately, and that is all you're doing this weekend. - I don't know, it has a numbing feeling to it. Like getting punched in the stomach and you're gasping for air, but you can't breathe. It's suffocating. One time against Temple last season, it was third quarter, they had the ball on their own 42. It was 2nd and seven, they run the play-action. QB ends up dumpin' it to their fullback. He's comin' around, everybody else is tied up. I see him, I start haulin' towards him. It was 15 yards out, 10, five, their tight end comes out of nowhere. Hits me, everything goes white. Next thing I remember is sittin' on the sidelines and it's blurry, but slowly starting to come back into focus. - Sorry, this is the concussion you're talking about? - Yeah, but it's that feeling after, of being confused, of not having a clue about what's goin' on or how you got there or where you're going. That's what this feels like, but in a much bigger sense. - Well, we all do things in life that we regret, the question is how do you rebound from this, you know? I mean, we helped you when your father died. Now, we're gonna help you again now that this has happened. - Yeah, but it's embarrassing, Dr. Stephens. I mean, I have to walk around campus and everybody knows that I let down the whole school. - Right, well, that's why we're gonna nip it in the bud. How's your prescription going? It's good, I take it like usual. Mm. - I talked with my mom and she thinks, and I do, too, that maybe a-- - Yeah, right, maybe, uh, dosage increase. - Yeah. - She, um, well, you know, you both may be right, because the body can get used to a certain dosage after time, and that's probably the case here. - Whatever helps me to get back on the team. - I agree. So, we're gonna increase you 15 milligrams a day for 60 days, see how you're feeling. Then you call me, and we'll go from there, all right? You know, you're at the age, Drew, where life has handing you new responsibilities. I'm just here to help. Greetings from Foreman Field. It's a beautiful day here in Norfolk, Virginia, as the Old Dominion Monarchs get set to host the number 17, Missouri A&M-- Oh, what did Dr. Stephens say? - Upped the dosage, agreed it would help. Uh-huh, see, I told you he'd know what to do. With the leadership of second-year coach Stan Thompson-- What are you doing? - Watching the game. - No, you're not, you're studying. - Mom, I, I'll do it afterwards. - Excuse me? - Can I at least have it on while I study? - You know what, you did this, not me! - What, oh, come on! Damn! What's wrong? - Uh, just studying. What are you studying? - European political systems. - How's that going? - Uh, it's going all right, I'm just a little confused between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. - Mm, Germany's legislature. The Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Did you finished filling out these school apps? - Yep, I was up til three in the morning. - Well, good for you. You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today, Mr. Lincoln. Sounded a lot like Grandpa used to. - Hmm, well you know what, because of your ADD, we need to, uh, apply for extra testing time for your LSATs. - Mom, I'm not disabled. - Honey, if you have an advantage, you might as well use it. I also wanted to talk to you about Thanksgiving. I know we usually do something here, but this year, Elliot's gonna fly me to his golf retreat in Hilton Head to rub elbows with some of his powerful friends. - OK. - I'm sorry about that, but I'm sure Ashley's family would love to have you. You know, I read her article about me, I was very impressed. Did you know that she's not only gonna publish it in the school newspaper, but she's gonna reach out to other Missouri outlets as well? I'm really looking forward to seeing her at the fundraiser. It starts at seven, so make sure you're there on time. Hello? Honey? - We broke up, Mom. - What? Why, when? A few weeks ago, I don't know. - Well, why didn't I know about this? - I just, I don't know, I don't know, just, I don't know. Well, why did you break up? - Look, ask her about it, I just don't want her there. Honey, I mean, I'm really sorry this happened, I am, but what do you expect me to do? I can't just now dis-invite her. No, her entire grade depends on this project, and we agreed to this before the semester began. Besides, I hate to say it, but it's free publicity for my campaign. Do you have any idea how much publicity costs? - Does she really have to be there? I mean, can't you just give her a Cliff Notes version of the evening? Are you, oh my God. It's a little selfish, but sure, just come alone. Thank you. - I hope you all enjoyed your weekend. Did anybody else have a heart attack watching that game? Well, a win is a win. Just a reminder that your test is this Wednesday, and before I forget, I have an extra credit opportunity for you. Tonight at Ellis Auditorium, New York Times journalist Marla Scott is speaking at eight p.m. I'm offering extra credit to anyone who attends and writes a one-page summary. Now, continuing on with today's lecture. France and Germany's governments. I know, I'm so excited. I have no idea what happens-- Ladies, if you could just calm down a little bit, thank you. We're gonna go ahead and start the executive meeting. OK, first up, we have our social chair, Ashley. How's the winter formal coming along? - Formal is coming along nicely. Uh, it's gonna be at the Jefferson City Country Club again. Just booked the DJ, the shuttles will leave out of our parking lot at six, dinner starts at seven, and there will be a cash bar as well. - That's great, but I have some amazing news. I got an email from Jennifer Finch, class of '78, billionaire daughter of Henry Finch, and she let me know that she would be in town the weekend of the formal. Yes, so I've invited her and her husband as our Guests of Honor, and I let her know that this formal will be the best one ever. Uh, so, whatever we did last year, we have to bring to the next level. - OK, uh, well, what we have now is great, and almost all of the semester funds have been spent already, so depending on how much more extravagant you want this, we don't really have the money. - Hmm, well, I was thinking, if we would allow, some more funding for the set-up of the formal. I mean, does anybody have any objections to that? Great. - OK, so, what else do you want? - Oh, I don't know. Perhaps, um, ice sculptures, or we could get a sled and put Santa on it and have everyone take pictures with him, or, um, oh, oh! How 'bout a reindeer, you know? - Uh, a reindeer? I mean, you're, you're joking, right? - I'm not. Yeah, no, um, the more we wow Jennifer Finch, the more money she's gonna give to the house and your sisters. OK, Ashley? - OK, Lauren. Well, good luck with that reindeer. - Right. Is she serious? - I think so. I know you're stressed, I'm sorry. - Probably not gonna get any sleep this week, but, you know, it's fine. - Hey, hey, I'm going to help you! - You know what would really help me? What? - Can you get me some Adderall from Jarrett? - Aw, you're having withdraws from Drew and Drew's Adderall! - Stop! - It's a joke, actually, I can't. He's all out til after Thanksgiving. Are you serious? - Yeah, he sells out, like, as soon as he gets it. God! - Why don't you just fake symptoms, go get your own prescription. How do you think he gets his? - Thank you for hosting me this evening. It's great to be back in my home state of Missouri. I'm a Mizzou grad, so don't hate me too much, but at least we can all agree on our absolute disdain for the Kansas Jayhawks. Although I don't have a degree in journalism and didn't set out to be a journalist or a reporter, my law degree took me down several twisting career paths that ultimately brought me to where most of you wanna be, Congressional Reporter for the New York Times. - David, life is full of surprises, including seeing you here, but you're not getting any extra credit, OK, I'll see you in class. - Thanks, Professor Mueller. - You got it. Drew, hey, I am so sorry about your football suspension. That was never my intention. - I didn't plagiarize that paper. - Well, put yourself in my position, all right? I-I treat all of my students equally. It wouldn't have been fair to any of them if I let you hand in that paper a third time! - I get that. - I'm not here to ruin kids' lives. You need to be responsible, you need to be accountable for your actions. - I am taking responsibility for my actions. That's why I'm here. I need to come to things like this for extra credit now, so I can get back on the team. - Good, good to hear, keep it up. - Well, listen, sorry, I've gotta run. I've got a study for a European political systems test. - Professor Grove? Yeah. - That's a tough class. Yep. When's the test? - Wednesday. Hmm, are those your notes? Mm-hmm. - OK, step into my office. Come on, let's see what we got. Come on, I don't bite. Take a load off. May I? OK, so consider the U.S. Congress with the House and Senate when you're comparing Germany's legislature of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, but the Bundestag is more powerful because it's the one that comes up with the ideas for the bills and laws and just needs an overall OK from the Bundesrat, and if there's a disagreement, a conciliation committee is set up to iron out their differences. - That actually sounds a bit more efficient than Congress. You got five or six hours for me to air out my grievances? - Think I have a lot still to do, but, uh, it's definitely a start, so, thank you, sir. - Uh, OK, you gotta can the sir right now, all right? My name is Jeff. All right, uh, thanks again, uh-- Jeff. - Jeff. - My, my pleasure. Listen, while I got you, uh, do not be afraid to ask your teachers for help, OK? It's why we're here. We like to do it, that's why we took this job. It's why we're around, all right? - All right, will do. OK. - Thanks, Jeff. - Seriously, just look at up close. - Dude, I'm not lookin' at any man closely, bro. - See, Aaron Rodgers is the love child between Jake Gyllenhaal and Jon Hamm. ♪ I see you lookin' at me cynical - You are so fuckin' real with this love child shit, dude! - Drew? - Yeah, maybe. - Thank you. - He said maybe. - I'll take it. - Dude, ever since that girl last year on spring break thought you were Jake Gyllenhaal, you been on this shit! That's some Brokeback-type shit right there. That's what that is. - I don't think I can quit you! All right, enjoy practice, guys. - You should come say, "What up!" - Eh, I don't wanna piss Coach off. - Whatta you mean? With you bein' up in class and everything, it'd be good for the younger guys. What you talkin' about? - Yeah, we just won, might as well take advantage of him being in a good mood. - All right. - Yeah. - Come on. - So with, uh, Jezelowski's hammy, I'm not really sure exactly what we're gonna do. - Yeah, we'll see with the-- Hey, Coach. - Hey, hey, Dawson, how's it goin'? - I was just droppin' Radar and Kyle off, thought I'd stop by, but, uh, if you don't want me here. - Eh, man, stop it. It's great to see you. - Uh, congratulations on the win. - Congrats, hey, look, Drew, you might be suspended, but you are still an important part of this team. It's just as much your win as it is mine, OK? But hey, we missed your leadership out there. We weren't mentally prepared after the Mizzou win. How are classes coming? - Studying like crazy. I'll be back for the bowl game. - That's what I wanna hear. - Oh, you mind if I say hi to the team? - No, no, go for it! Thanks. - Hey, Drew, if you're not doin' anything on Thanksgiving, um, you wanna roll down with us to Hattiesburg? I ran it by the AD just in case. - Yeah, yeah, of course! - Great, bus leaves from here eight a.m. Thanksgiving morning. Uh, we're gonna do a team Thanksgiving at the hotel, and I let the guys go on Friday so they can be home for the weekend. - That's great, I'll be there. Great, keep up the hard work, Drew. - Hello, Ashley, I'm Dr. Adams. What brings you in today? Ashley, Ashley? - What? What brings you in today? - Oh, I think I had ADD. - Oh, tell me about your symptoms. - Uh, it's hard for me to concentrate. I get distracted easily. You know, I've, I've, I'm forgetting stuff all the time. I'm, I'm all over the place. - How long has this been going on? - Years. - What made you decide to come in and see me today? I, I didn't think I had a disorder until I started researching it online. - Oh, well, let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself, about your jobs, classes. - I take 18 hours of classes, I write for the school newspaper. Uh, sorority stuff, internships. - How are your stress levels? Ashley, how are your stress levels? - Off the charts. Hmm. - And I have trouble sleeping. You know, I feel like I'm always playing catch up. - You know, I have a lot of people that come in here and think they have ADD, but like you, they just need to practice a little more time management and healthier lifestyle choices. - No, I-I-I know I have ADD. I did the research, even my friends think I have it. - Changing your lifestyle is the answer, not medication. So you want me to put that on a resume? Instead of being social chair of my sorority, I chose to relax? - Ashley. - Are you gonna get me a job - at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch? - Hey, man, you wanna play? Uh, I gotta write this thing. It's due tomorrow. - Man, you always have something due. I'm tellin' ya, make the jump to general studies, we never have anything due. Or to do, really. Hey, I'm gonna get outta here. All right. - It's open. Hey, Drew, what's goin' on? How'd the test go? - Uh, good, I think. Your notes helped, uh, but my brain was fried. I, I didn't get much sleep, so. - Uh-huh, so, what can I do for you today? - Uh, I've got this paper comin' up, and I tried talking to my teacher, and that didn't really work out so well. You mentioned reaching out for help if you ever needed anything, so, you know, your notes were really great the other day, and I thought maybe-- - This is you asking me for some help? OK, I see. - Yeah. So what class is it? - 19th century European history. - Ah, yes, the start of mass politics, big business, railroads, spying politicians. So glad to see that things haven't changed. So tell me, is it the class itself or structuring the paper, what is it? - Phew, a little bit of both, actually. - Gotcha, OK, hang on. Let me see something here. All right, um, I'll tell you what. I got about an hour, so why don't we get outta here. I'm starving, are you hungry? - I haven't eaten today. - OK, I'll take that as a yes. You like Shakespeare's Pizza? Yeah, who doesn't? All right, I'm buying. OK, let's go. Come on, after you. Oh, present my thesis and intro. Organize the body into three different sections, and tie it all up at the end. - Boom, there you go. That's exactly how you write a good paper. Hey, don't forget the citations. - Yeah. - Give, give me your pen, here. This is my private email. Email me that paper and I'll make sure it's formatted right. - Appreciate it. - You got it, can't believe I'm actually doing this, though. - What, eat with a failed student? - Mm-mm, eating with a Cardinals fan. - Ho-ho, must be a Cubs fan. What's it been, 105 years? 108, man, get your facts straight. - What do they say Cubs stands for, uh, completely useless by September? Come on, you're gonna give me that, now? We just won the World Series! OK, now, granted, we may not have as many titles as you. - Well, if you wanna borrow one of our 11 World Series trophies-- - You can keep 'em, and your St. Louis style pizza. - Imo's? - Sucks. Come on, it's the best! - It's the worst, the worst! Provel cheese, oh my God! This, this is good pizza, and that's comin' from a Chicagoan. - I never saw you as the pizza type, always eatin' that green stuff in class. - Mm, you should try some of that green stuff. It's good for ya. You ever had chia seeds? - Uh, like the Chia Pet, no. - Yeah, like the Chia Pet. Long before chia seeds were sprinkled on plastic figurines and sold at Walgreen's as pets, the Aztecs, the Mayans, they ate it as proteins. Endurance runners, they use it, too. Are you a runner? - Yeah, I've run a few marathons in my day. Not tomorrow! - You should after this whole pie of pizza. Nah, that's pretty cool. I'll have to eat some of those seeds then, uh, before our game one time. - Yeah, you should. And speaking of eating, am I gonna have to inhale this whole pizza myself, you haven't touched a thing! - I guess I'm not that hungry. - You said you hadn't eaten today. - I, um, probably my dosage increase. What do you mean, dosage increase? - For my ADD. - You have ADD? - Since I was 10. - So, why are you increasing your dosage? - Uh, my doctor said my body probably got used to the previous dosage so upped me a little bit. Uh, said it could help with everything goin' on. - Well, you should eat something, OK? You need to have something in your system. So, you always wanted to play football at A&M? - Yep, my dad used to play here, too. My parents met here and, uh, then went up East so my mom could go to law school. - She still practice law? - She's, uh, circuit attorney for St. Louis County, and planning to run for, uh, a seat in the U.S. House next year. - No shit, what's her name? - Kate Dawson. So how's that goin' for you? - It's all right, I'm used to it. - What about your dad, what does he do? - Eh, he passed away. Mm, I'm sorry. - No, it's all right, it happened a long time ago. Car accident. Sorry. So what's your major? - Poli sci. - What do you wanna do with that? - Oh, law school. - Law school, really? - Yeah, law is in the family just like football. - Mm, you know, uh, I was supposed to go to law school. And, uh, when I told my folks I wanted to be a teacher, they acted like the sky was falling. My, I got two older brothers, and they're both doctors, so you can imagine the standards that I was supposed to follow. I mean, hell, my sister's considered a bigger success than I am and she's just married a rich guy. See the point, no, I'm serious. She gets so much credit for that, it's crazy! Here, Drew, you gotta do you, OK? That's the whole secret, all right? You're gonna be miserable in your life if you choose a career that you don't love, OK? - The only thing I love is football. Suspension or not, that's gonna be over with soon, anyway. It doesn't have to. - I'm not goin' pro. - No, but you could be a coach or a trainer or an analyst. Figure out what you would do as a career if you were paid nothing, OK? And then figure out a way to make a living doing it. If you're passionate and give it 110 percent, the universe will have your back. That's a promise. Come on, eat up. ♪ Something in you feels like home - But, Kate, I am so proud of you. You've done such great things for this city, and you are gonna do great things in Washington representing this district. - Aw, thank you so much, that's sweet. - And Drew, I understand that you're gonna be headin' off to law school soon. - Um, yes, I am. - Great, where ya headed? - Illinois, maybe Michigan. - Or Stanford or Northwestern. - Northwestern, nice, what do you plan to specialize in? - Corporate. - Yeah, we feel he's best suited for corporate. - If you have half the drive of your mom, you'll do great. Kate, I know you need to mingle, it's been great seeing you. You guys have a great Thanksgiving. Let me know what I can do for your campaign, be happy to help. - Absolutely, thanks so much. - All right, great seeing ya. - Drew, nice to see you, good luck in law school. - Try to be a little bit more assertive when you speak. - What the hell is she doing here? I told you we broke up! - I'll be right over. Hi, you look beautiful! - Good, thank you! - Sorry if I'm late, I had to stop by my parents' house first. - Oh, that's fine, now come this way. There's someone I'd like you to meet. Elliot, Elliot, Ashley Ross, this is Mr. And Mrs. Handle. Mr. And Mrs. Handle are the hosts for this evening's gala, as well as very generous contributors to my campaign. - Elliot Handle, and my wife Elona, pleasure to meet you, welcome! - Ashley Ross, you have a beautiful estate. Thank you for having me. - Ashley is writing a piece for her journalism class on making the leap from local to national politics, and she is also a reporter for the school newspaper, and she plans on publishing the piece after the semester. - Wonderful, how do you two know each other? - Ashley and Drew, they go to school with each other. - You've surrounded yourself with an amazing group of women, Drew. Don't we all wish we could be that lucky, hmm? So Ashley, what are your journalistic aspirations? - Uh, last summer, I interned at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, so I'm hoping after I graduate I can, uh, make my home there. Can I get another? Sure, what are ya havin'? - Uh, whiskey and ginger. Hit a shot. - So are you just ignore me all night? - Seriously, just don't even talk to me. - I'm doing this for class. What do you want me to do? Jeopardize my grade just because we broke up? - Well, you jeopardized other people's grades before, so-- - Oh, that's rich! Maybe if you had taken some responsibility in the first place, you wouldn't have been in that position! Sorry for being selfless. - Selfless, like when you had your tongue down your ex-boyfriend's fuckin' throat? I'm surprised he's not here as your date. - Would you grow up! You miss us, I know you do. There's got to be some reason that you didn't tell your mom that we broke up. - Actually, I did tell her, but she didn't give a shit. As usual, she chose her career first. You know, you guys are actually cut from the same cloth, aren't you? - Fuck you! - Wow. You know, for such a talented, creative writer, I would've expected a little more eloquence. You're not even worth my time. - Andrew, honey, I need you back inside. - I need to get outta here. - What, no, you're not leaving here! You're not gonna embarrass me in front of all these people! - Oh, but it's OK for you to embarrass me? And, don't, would you just please act like an adult for once in your life? - Hey, we're ready for you. - All right. Please-- Go, go! - Please get back inside! - I'm leaving! - I'm going back to Jeff City, I'm flying down with the team tomorrow. - You cannot drive, you've been drinking too much. - I don't care. - Andrew! - 'Scuse me! Asshole. - Fuck you. What? Uncle Jack, come on! You got a problem? We got places to be, man, let's not mess with this. - Nice parkin' job, by the way. - Thanks, I'd park it on your mother's face. - We got places to be. - Drinking, gonna get in the car. Back off! - No, I don't think so! - Come on, man, come on! Listen to your buddy or you get fucked up. - Prove it, why don't you come get some? Punk-ass, stupid college kid! There's the guard. Beautiful day, Coach. - OK, you, too, man, all right, Willis. All right, all right, lookin' good, lookin' good. Hey, where's your roommate? - I don't know, Coach, he didn't sleep at our place last night, and his phone goes straight to voicemail. I know he was in St. Louis for somethin' with his mom last night, probably just stayed out there and didn't tell anybody. Happy Thanksgiving. Yo-yo! - Hey, there he is! Coach can finally call off his search party! Division Champs, son! Oh, shit, what the fuck happened to you? - Bro, I don't even know. I went to my mom's fundraiser, Ashley showed up, I had a little too much to drink and ended up in a drunk tank. Get the fuck outta here, you serious? - Nice shiner! - Yeah, thanks. - Yeah, you better hope Coach doesn't find out. You should probably call him. - Yeah, about that, um. You're a mess! - Goddamn! - Yeah. - Well, at least you guys look good from the couch. - Shit, talk about lookin' good, dude. Those Hattiesburg honies, brother, talkin' 'bout Southern Hospitality, what! Ba-bah, yeah, you missed out, brother, you missed out. - I got a mud puppy barkin' outta my butt I gotta take for a walk. Why don't you tell him the news, Radar? - What's up? Oh, over Thanksgiving, I told the boys after this season, I'm goin' pro. - Are you serious, shoo! Yeah, man. - Congratulations, Radar, that's awesome! Thank you, man, yeah, I figure I might as well strike while the iron's hot, you know? - Yeah, so what's Coach say? - Oh, he's cool, man. I talked to him a couple weeks ago. He reached out to some scouts for the Rams and Chiefs, and said I can probably go second, third round pick. Get out, sha, that's great! Yeah, I appreciate that, brother. - Yep. - Hey, before I leave, do you think I can get a few more of those addies? - Yeah, but I mean-- - Well, did you see the game I had last night? - Yeah, but goin' pro, don't you think it's a little risky? I was all over that field, I ain't riskin' nothin'! It's, uh, dosage increase. So just be careful. - Dang. - Increased dosage, increased focus, right? That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, thanks a lot, man. Appreciate it. So what's up wit' chu, kid? Comin' back, what's up, talk to me! - Yeah, man, the only way I'm not gonna be back on the field is if I freakin' miss one of these finals. Ah, gotchu, baby! Tellin ya, since I'm goin' pro now, we need one last hurrah, man. That's the bowl game, brother. We need you out there, I need you out there. - I'll be there. Arright. Get psyched for it, baby, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout! - Great work on the paper. Like I said in the notes, the other TA's and myself agree, dude. It's one of the best in the class. It's really well-written, I mean, you were one of the few who mentioned how the Bon Marche was not only the first and biggest department store, but how they were also the pioneers of the modern day corporate structure of a business. - And the final will cover everything from the whole semester? - Yeah, it'll be cumulative. You'll pick two out of six topics, you'll write about 'em in class. You do what you did on that paper, you'll be fine. - Overall, good job on the test. The TA's are passing them back now. Take a second to look them over. If you have any questions, feel free to ask either myself, or the Teaching Assistants. Momentarily, we'll begin prep for your final. Hey. Hey yourself. - Where's Brad? Uh, he just texted me. He said that he'll be here in 30 minutes. - But how does that tie into, like, the Industrial Revolution? She didn't even describe that. - She did, it's, I wrote it down. - Yeah, but this doesn't make sense what you wrote, because if it's the great age of railroad building-- - Yeah, but you gotta read the whole thing. - What does it have to do with mining? I mean, obviously, it has to do with mining, but, like, I don't understand-- - Kristen, just, can you read? It's just, it's right there. - Are you serious? Are you OK? What's the matter? Just I don't feel that great. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go get a drink of water, OK? - OK. - I'll be back. - So we come back to our place, and the dude is drunk! And he's passed out naked on the couch. I'm tellin' you, no joke, completely naked. Has a piece of pizza coverin' his junk. We, we still have the stains on our couch, I can prove it! - That's ridiculous! I see football players in a whole new light now. Yeah. - Do you wanna go downstairs and grab some coffee? My treat. - Sure. - I need to see these stains. Sara Kaufman. Gotcha. Excuse me. - Yes, may I help you? - Yeah, hi, I lost my prescription to Adderall, and I need to get a refill. Do you have a prescription with you? - No, I just lost it, and I need to get another one. - Uh, without a written prescription from your doctor, there's nothing I can give you. - And you're not gonna look me up? It, it's academic with a written-- - I, I need, oh. Thank you. - Busy. What did I just say? - You have a phone call. - Who is it? - Drew Dawson. - Aw, Jesus, what the hell does he want? I don't know, it sounds urgent. Christ, all right. Hey, Drew, how's it goin'? - Uh, not so good, I just lost my bottle of Adderall, and I need to get a new one. I'm at the pharmacy right now, and they won't fill it for me. - Unfortunately, Drew, I can't write ya a new script. You just filled your last prescription. - It's finals week coming up, what the hell am I supposed to do? - Let's just, let's think about this clearly, OK? - I am thinking clearly. I've got finals coming up and I need to ace them all without the medicine that helps me accomplish those things. So, how am I supposed to do that, Dr. Stephens? How am I supposed to ace the exams and get back on the football team without a prescription that I've had for the last 10 years? - Look, Drew, I'm sorry. My hands are tied. You're just gonna have to study as hard as ya can, you're gonna have to go through everything really thoroughly and prepare the best you can. Drew, listen to me, you may have some withdraw symptoms from the Adderall. Uh, you probably will, in fact. If they get to be too much, you call me, all right, and we'll, and we'll go from there, OK, Drew? Drew, oh, Jesus! - This is that sour diesel shit right here, but for real. My uncle works for the RIAA, and he literally has to go through every word of every song on every album, rate it and submit it. - That sounds boring as hell, man. - No, he really digs it. He's a hippie and shit, all spiritual. Drew, what up, dawg? - Hey. - Come on in. You getting pumped for Louisiana Tech? - Yeah, yeah, definitely. All right! What's up, dude? So, what can I do you for? - Um, I'm in a little bit of a bind, actually. I, my Adderall's nowhere to be found, and my doctor won't give me a refill. Ashley said before that you might have some. - Yeah, she was supposed to come by earlier this week when I got my refill, but she's buggin' out about gettin' some of it I think. - Really? - Problem is, I'm all out. Sold out yesterday. Damn, you gotta be kiddin' me. - No. You know anybody else? - Not off the top of my head. Everybody always comes through me to get it. Yeah, me, too. - If it means anything, in my psych class today, we watched this video about the dude who discovered ADD, and he said on his deathbed it was a fictitious disease. What was, what was his name? Heisenberg. - Oh, no, that's Breaking Bad. Ei, Eisenberg, Eisenberg, Leon Eisenberg. - That's great, how does that help me? - I don't know, just sayin'. Maybe you could try your finals without it. - Yeah, I'll think about that. Uh, if you get anything or whatever, just let me know, all right, thanks. - For sure. You don't gotta go! Dude, we're gonna order pizza! Crazy! Ooh, no, take another one! - Seriously, guys. That's so funny! - Come on! Gotta send that one-- I love it! OK, I think you have to take it apart. Yeah. - OK, let's just, let's just take, just take these down there, and then, we'll just fuck with the tree later. Can we just do it tomorrow? - No, we can't do it tomorrow, we have to do it tonight! - It's like 12! - I have a test! Please, just please help me do this, and then you can go. Mm, I guess I should, OK. - Where do you want these? You're, just, you're not even carrying anything. - I'm carrying shit! That's like three things! They're all in one box, why didn't you just carry the box down? Are you kidding me? - It's getting really late. - I have, like, two finals tomorrow. OK, you know, just go. I can do it by myself better than with you guys here, because you're just slowing the process down, so just go, go, go. - Fine. I have to always do everything by my fucking self! Can we do it tomorrow? He's hit in the backfield by not one, but two defenders. He jukes past a third and gets a 15 yard gain. All season long, Manlieu has found ways to keep the clock running and dominate time of possession. First down, McNulty snaps it, throws it to Kyle Pherrell for about a five yard gain. Good play calling there on first down. If I was Missouri A&M, I'm not satisfied if we don't get at least three points before the half, as Tech will be receiving the kickoff in the second half. Manlieu lines up, hands it off to Lewis. - Mm, I will always hate papers. - I will never understand why they put the formal the weekend before finals. - I know, it's so stupid. Hey, where the hell have you been? I had a ass kicker of a morning. Studied until six, napped for an hour at the library, and took two finals. - You didn't even show up to formal. - I didn't have a date. - Oh my God, gimme a break, Ashley! You set that whole thing up, you texted me that you would be there, and you just blew us all off. - Oh, God, Kristen, relax. - You haven't even slept in your bed for the last week! I don't even know what sleep is. - Yeah, yeah, well it shows, 'cause you look like shit. - Thanks! Why are you doing this-- - What is your problem, why are you on my ass? I'm worried about you! - Why, I'm fine! I'm trying to be a friend. - I'm fucking busy, Kristen, I've got shit I have to do! - So do I, and I don't go MIA! - I gotta go blow off some steam at the gym. Ashley, what is wrong with you? - God, nothing is wrong, please, just leave me alone. You think you're acting normal? - No, uh, yes, I do. - Going to the gym, why are you going to the gym right now? - I can't do this with you right now. - You need to sleep! - I don't need to sleep, I took a nap already. I just told you that. - Why are you being such a bitch to me? - I'm being a bitch? - I'm trying to, to talk to you! I care about you, and you just keep blowing me off! - I just, I, I don't, look, I have one Mom. I don't need another one, OK? - I'm not trying to be your mom, I'm trying to be your best-- What are you doing? - Start doing what I'm asking for, and give me space! You're acting insane, this is not normal! - I'm not acting insane-- Yes, you are! - I'm acting like a normal person who needs space to get my shit done, OK? Get out, go! That's how you really feel? - That's how I really feel. Well, good luck with that. - Thank you. - So remember all the things we talked about after your earlier speeches, just enlighten us, inspire us, engage us, and all that anyone can ask is that you do your best, OK? We should have just enough time to get all of the groups in. I'm gonna start from left to right, across the room, so Brad, Drew, Sara, you'll be first, and then the next three and so on, OK? All right. - So our speech today is on the implications of the Free Flow of Information Act trying to be passed. At the turn of the 20th century, when Ida Tarbell was investigating John D. Rockefeller, and Joseph Pulitzer was establishing newspapers across the country, the age of yellow journalism had officially arrived. - So what does it mean to be a journalist? Is it salary, is it the amount of viewers or subscribers you have to any specific source? By allowing the American government to dictate for themselves who is a journalist, doesn't that violate the first amendment? - As they were saying, uh, the Free Flow of Information Act in the 20th century media-- It's, uh, new media. - Drew, do you wanna take a second? - No. I, I can't, I can't do this, guys, I'm sorry. - Evening, I'm looking for Andrew Dawson. - I'm Drew, how can I help you? - You currently have a prescription for Adderall, correct? - Yes, I do, why? A bottle of Adderall with your name on it was found today. - I lost that bottle almost a week ago. Where'd you guys find it? - In the possession of another person. Now, in this state, that's a minimum Class A misdemeanor, potentially a felony. - Wait, wha, another person? So are you suggesting that I sold them? - I'm not suggesting anything, just trying to get to the bottom of this. Do you know an Ashley Ross? Sorry for dragging you out like this. Adderall, huh? - Well, it's everywhere. - Well, at least Ashley's gonna be all right. - She almost fuckin' died. I don't know what I woulda done, being responsible for two people's death in my lifetime. - What do you mean, two people's deaths? - I was 10 and I was in recess at school, so, uh, we just finished, uh, and I was wired. Amped, runnin' around, excited, I couldn't sit still. My teacher, she had a short fuse, and she, uh, gave me a detention after school, so, uh, when my dad was on his way to pick me up, he got T-boned by another car in the intersection at a red light. I remember sittin' in that room, just watchin' the clock. 3:30, 4:30, five, finally my mom came to pick me up and, when she was done yellin' my ear off, she got the call. I'll never forget her scream. - Drew, you know you're not to blame for that, right? - No detention, no car crash, right? So, what are you gonna do now? - I don't know what to do, that's why I called you. Well, I think you need to go see your mom, you know? Talk about all of this. - Talk to my mom? Yeah. You don't know her wrath. - You asked me for my advice, that's my advice. You go tell her what's goin' on and face the music. You'll get through this. - I got this. Patrick, what are you doing here? - May I come in, it's urgent. - So, what's going on? - I got a call from Drew last week. He said he lost his prescription, and he needed a refill. However, if I didn't want red flags to pop up, I couldn't do it. - Wait, you neglected to tell me this? Do you mean he's taking his finals without his meds? Get him a refill! - Hold on, on top of that, I just got a call from the Missouri A&M police department. A girl, Ashley Ross, collapsed in the gym yesterday. She had his pills. I believe that's his girlfriend. - His ex-girlfriend, please tell me she's OK. - She's alive, she's in the hospital. - Oh, shit! This could be the end of my campaign! - If I get taken to court, I risk my license. You know my history, and you're right. The fallout for you, it could end your career. - Goddammit, I'm already up to here trying to clean up his mess and now this! - This better not ruin my career, Kate. I told you that he did not have ADD when you first came to see me. That this was just a temporary fix. And this last time, calling in a dosage increase for his prescription, when does it end? Oh, really, you're gonna get on your high horse? I believe plenty of times was your response when I originally asked you if you've ever done this before. But for how long, Kate? First it was his grades, then it was what high school he was going to. Then his SAT scores. You're more addicted to his success than he is! - Oh my God! What are you doing here? Honey, Dr. Stephens got a call from the police asking why Ashley had your prescription bottle. Would you like to explain yourself? - I, I want you to repeat exactly what you said right before I walked in here. Uh, I said a lotta things, Drew. I don't know, I don't know what you want me to say. - You said I never had ADD. - No, Andrew, honey, honey, no, honey, don't-- - Don't fucking touch me! I never had ADD, huh? Dad dies and your response is to put me on fucking pills! Ashley almost died. Mom, Ashley, the same girl you paraded around that fundraiser like the daughter you never had, is in the hospital, hooked up to a machine all because you wanted me on pills! Why, why would you do that to your own son? - Honey, you were acting out in school. Your teachers told me you were shutting down. I couldn't-- - I was grieving Dad's death. Maybe I was acting up in school for some attention because I never got any from you! So, so, so then you take me from psychiatrist to psychiatrist until you find one who will diagnose me with ADD? - Sweetheart, sweetheart, you were falling behind in school. Your teachers said your work wasn't up to par, what, honey, what was I supposed to do? Be a fucking mom! - Oh, really? Yes! - Well, you know what, you have no idea what is was like for me when your father died! I couldn't quit my job, I had a roof over our heads to pay for and two mouths to feed! I worked my ass off to get where I am, and look how far we've come, Andrew, look! You going to law school, your grandfather's firm, and me, I'm running for a seat in the U.S. Congress! - So we are all clear, I will not be going to law school, nor will I be working at Grandpa's firm, nor anything because I'll most likely be expelled next semester, so that doesn't bode well for law school applications, now does it? - Why, why are you throwing all of this away? - Do you really need an answer for that? - Anyone with an ounce of intelligence would realize the opportunities that I've given you! - Keep telling yourself that. - You are such a disappointment. - Drew, come on, come on. We're just, we're tryin' to help you, we're all tryin' to help you. - Help me, help me? You don't give a shit about me! You're just a drug dealer with a fuckin' license. ♪ Are you lonesome, how've you been ♪ Lay your head beside me, take your rest ♪ Have I left you short of breath ♪ That I let you Hi, you've reached Ashley Ross. I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave me a message, I'll give you a call back as soon as I can. Thanks so much. ♪ Well, let's go ♪ Beside the ocean ♪ Bring you home ♪ Another version of me I'm so sorry. - Hey, I'm just happy you're alive. How did you get the pills? - I saw you with some girl at the library, and I got jealous. When I went over to the table, I saw the bottle and I, I just took it. - Sara, we had a group exercise for class, which I ended up walking out of 'cause I didn't know what the hell I was doing. Oh my God, Drew! I should've never given you any pills in the first place. - Stop it. I did this to myself. I made my own bed and now, now I have to sleep in it. Well, you'll never guess what I found out. - What? - I drove home to St. Louis today, and when I pulled up to the driveway, my doctor's car was there, which is kinda weird 'cause I didn't know my mom even spoke with him. So I went into the house, and I overheard them talking and he said that I never had ADD, and that it was my mom who put me on pills in the first place. She claims that she did it so that I wouldn't fall behind in classes while I was grieving my dad's death. C'mere. It's OK. - My whole life, I was told that something was wrong with me. Paging Dr. Stavis-- - I don't even know who I am anymore. - Amazing, that's what you are. - You get some rest, uh, I'm not goin' back to St. Louis now. I can stop by tomorrow if you want, so you don't get too bored in here. I could come back and bring some Scattergories. - I thought you said you'd never play with me again after my farting fairies answer. It so counts, it's a double letter. That was disgusting. Only if you promise not to do that again. Maybe. Farting fairies. How many times did he have to say, "And don't forget your times and experiences here "at Missouri A&M?" - Aw, no, no, no, see, it's important he does that. It's part of the whole conspiracy thing, see, because when, uh, when you get that phone call every week from the A&M Alumni Association asking you for donations now that you're a graduate, you'll have that whole thing rollin' in your head. - Yeah, along with six years of memories. - Six years, but you did it on your own, you know? Bachelor's in athletic training has a nice ring to it. - Well, it definitely beats the idea of law school. You in law school? Aw, you know Einstein, he said that we all have genius, but if you judge a fish by how it climbs a tree, it'll spend its whole life thinkin' it's stupid. - Smart guy. - Yeah, I always preferred that quote to that whole E equals MC squared mass equivalence thing that everybody talks about. OK. You ready? - You really think this is a good idea? - I think we're civilized enough to do this. Uh-oh, look out! Oh, my goodness, he came prepared, look at you! - The game starts in 10 minutes, I had to come ready. - You know, the entire city of Chicago and my family would disown me if they knew I was watchin' the game with you. - Well, it was your idea. - Yeah, I'm havin' a little bit of buyer's remorse. - Look, after we win, I promise you I won't give you too much crap. - After you lose, you're gonna pay the bill. Harpo's? - Let's do it. - Let's do it! - And so remember, we have to go through H.R.344, H.R.457, and H.R.882 all before five o'clock deadline. The executive director of the St. Louis Zoo will be here at 10 to discuss tourism funding, and at noon, you're meeting with the mayor for lunch at Tony's. - What time is our flight to D.C. tomorrow? Uh, we have to be at the airport at eight a.m. - Just give me a minute. Yes? Jesus Christ, Ken, schedule it for next week! I don't have another minute to fit it in this week! What? - House Veterans Affairs wants to schedule a sit-down. ♪ Let me in and let me touch you ♪ I can be what you're addicted to ♪ Oh, whoa, oh ♪ Let me and let me break you ♪ I'll be your heroine, I'll bring you down ♪ I'll be a bad trip comin' around ♪ Drink me in, take me inside ♪ Let me control you when I blow your mind ♪ I got what you need, gimme a try ♪ Let me be your ride tonight ♪ I'll be your high ♪ Whoa ♪ Let me in and let me hold you ♪ I can love you like you've never known ♪ Let me in, I'll drive you crazy ♪ I can be the raindrops in your veins ♪ I'll hit you like cocaine ♪ Drink me in, take me inside ♪ Let me control you when I blow your mind ♪ I got what you need, gimme a try ♪ Let me your ride tonight ♪ I'll be your high ♪ I'll be your high ♪ Once I'm inside ♪ It's impossible to fight ♪ There's nowhere you can hide ♪ So don't even try ♪ 'Cause when I leave ♪ You'll be begging to drink me in ♪ Take me inside ♪ Let me control you when I blow your mind ♪ I got what you need, gimme a try ♪ Let me be your ride tonight ♪ I'll be your high ♪ I'll be your high ♪ Let me in and let me touch you ♪ I can be what you're addicted to
