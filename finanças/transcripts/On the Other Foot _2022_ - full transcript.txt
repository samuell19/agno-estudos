Good, yeah. Okay, here look. A spiritual day in the African calendar where what you wish for may come true. Normally associated with doing good or changing someone's outlook, i.e., poor to rich or fat to slim. See, Bill, careful for what you wish for me, mate. Shut up, I didn't wish for this, did I? Leave me alone. Mate, I'm only sayin', that's all. Huh? Who is you talkin' to dad? Oh, no one, nothing, I'm just, just listen, we've gotta get back to that church. Gotta find that geezer. He's gotta change me black. Back, He's gotta change me back. Oh God help us. Pastor, we need to talk to you. You mean under all this, you are actually a White man? Hey. - Mmm. - Exactly, he's my dad. Your dad, your dad. This one? Father, forgive me. Father, forgive me. I actually thought the whole thing was bullshit. So you mean to tell me you are White, White, White? As in small penis, White. Can't season chicken, White. Can't sit out in the sun for too long, White. Wait mate, listen, this ain't funny, mate. You did this. I did this. No, you, you, you did this. This is what you wanted. This was your wish. - I never asked for... - This is what you asked for. I never asked for this. Listen, wait, wait, wait. I will talk to the elders. I will be right back. What's he laughin' at? I'll give you small penis. Hello, sir. Sorry to disturb you. Elder Barrymore, I have a question. Umbadehdeh Day, is it real? Man, what time is it over there? It's real. How do you think I got the cars, the penthouse... Stop. How do you think I got the cars, the penthouse, the... Stop. I gotta go. I need to go and pray right now. Relax, it's gonna be fine. Gonna be fine, look at me. There's nothin' fine about- Yeah, hold up, hold up, here he is. So, you want the good news or the bad news? The good news is it will only last for 72 hours. 72 hours, that's three days. Are you, what, good news- Calm down, calm down. I love being Black, it's great. You should love it, too. All right, well, what's the bad news then? The bad news is outside there you are Black. Inside your home you are White, except when you look in the mirror. When you look in the mirror, you see the real you, the true you, fat, Black, and stupid. Like you are now. What am I gonna do? You are going to have to be Black. My friend, it has its pluses. What sort of pluses? What, is that it? Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. You said may. Mmhmm. - May last 72 hours, right? - Uh-huh. The black bead I put in your pocket, smash it, burn sage over it. It will reverse it. Before you know it you are back to being White, Chas and Dave, fish and chips, the stuff you know. The bead. Dad. My god, right. Have you seen my trousers? The ones I had on the other day. The ones with the fancy patterns on. Oh, those African wallpaper looking things? Those ones, where are they? - They're in the wash. - In the wash. The wash? Ah, the wash. What was in the pockets? Change, tissue, oh, and some old dirty bead. Beads, what'd you do with the beads? Upstairs. Upstairs, bead, oh my god, oh my god. My life. Oh the bin. No, the bin's empty, love. Yeah, it's bin day. I threw everything out. Threw everything out. Three days. You're tellin' me I gotta look like Kunta or whatever his name is for three bloody days? It ain't funny, Claire. Dad, seriously, you don't look too bad. And now that your voice is changed, you actually sound cool. Okay, the hair's a bit Jackson 5, or actually, no, Andre 3000, but it's nothin' that a trip to the barbers and some new clothes won't fix. Luke can help you. But we definitely gotta keep this from the others. Especially Brandon. Andre who? Look at the hands. People will start lookin' just put 'em down. Stick to your own kind. Just ignore 'em, Dad. I do. Wait, is she talkin' about us? Yeah, me and Luke get it all the time, but we just ignore 'em. They're just ignorant. How would she like it if it was her daughter? Hey guys. Hey. How are you? This is Sahara's cousin, Gavin. Gavin, why we gotta be Gavin? What's wrong with Billy? He's gonna be stayin' with me for a few days. He's stayin' with you at your house? No, no, no, not with me. I mean, with, he's gonna be with us for a few days. He don't know London too well, and Sahara's busy, so I said, maybe you lot can take him and do the whole male bonding thing. Take him to get his hair done. Cool, I got you, bro. Nice to meet you. What a gwarn? Yeah, big up yourself, bro. Done know the stuff, nah. Nah, man. Don't try and act Black. Just be yourself. Actually, no, don't be yourself. Just be- Yo, we gotta go, you know? I'm gonna take you to the barbers before me and Khan go kick ball, yeah? Go on, Dad. Just try and act normal. Normal. Normal White or normal Black? Oh no. All right, just walk normal. How they walk. That's it. Ah, it's the bloke from "The Green Mile" and Tupac with a ponytail. Oh God, I'm knackered. Ta, nice.

Oh, bollocks. What do they call their haircuts? I'll have a short back and sides, governor, and do whatever you do to the top, yeah. Did you just say short back and sides, gov? Are you being serious? So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna shave down the sides. Leave a little bit on the top, and maybe get Sandra in the back to cane roll it for you, yeah? What's a cane role? Is that like a, is that like a bread or something? This is a barbers, not a bakery, bruv. Hey, how's dad? How's he doing? Dad? Gav. I said how's Gav doin'? Not dad. But how is he? Everything okay? I mean he's all right, I guess. He's a bit weird, though. Where did you say he was from again? I mean he's- That's great, babe. I'm really glad you're gettin' on. Listen, I've gotta go, but I'll call you later. All right? Bye. Wait, Claire, Claire, hello? Oh hey, that's nice, bruv. Good, innit?

It's gonna be the worst three days of my life. Yo, Luke, I was just sayin' to Simon, ain't it all men cheat? Yeah, all Black men. Bruv, that's mad general, man. I've never done that. I've never cheated. Wait, how long have you been with your girl, though? Yeah, how long have you been with my Princess? Been with her for about a year, but I've known her for three years. Wait, three years? And you ain't saw a next ting or beat a next gal? Yeah, hold on, hold on, beat who? Who beats women? He better not have put his filthy hands on my- Nah, man, I don't need no next gal. Why beat a next girl when we've got good one at the house? One's enough, bruv. Speak for yourself, son. Look, I'm an old man, and I still get tings. Young tings, too. You still, you know, at your age? I can still lay a little pipe on them. Yes, Pops is still beatin'. Why would you call sex a beat? Listen, me and Claire are good, you know. I mean Simon, you met her. I mean she's sensible, fun. She loves our culture. Her body's bangin', and she- Careful son, careful. Ticks all the right boxes for me, bruv. I don't need on next gal. Bruv, I'm good. Have you met her pops yet? - I mean her dad's- - I'm what? - Her dad- - What am I, son? Wants the best for her, which is understandable. I mean, he's not cool with the whole Black and White thing, but he'll come around. Over my dad dead body. There's no way- Billy, shh, you muppet. There's no way I'm gonna let my hair grow like that again. That was, that was ridiculous. This is the bollocks, mate. What'd you call this again? Cane roll. Hello? All right, yeah.

Yo, I was lookin' for a rave to go to as well. - Where is this? - No, no, no. I'm an owner of Prank or Fitt 2020, and this is health and life insurance. Surely you guys have life insurance. Hey Bill, health insurance. Pull the other one, mate. They'd rather spend their money on a flash car or chain. As if I can afford car insurance, big man. Come on. Exactly. Bruv, I'm good, you know, but these lot. Gav, let's go. Just leave the flyers over there, big man. Cheers. Yo, man's lookin' fresh still. What, so you man ready, yeah?

I'm starvin', look, can we get somethin' to eat? Table for three, guys? - Yes, please. - No problem, please follow me and take this table. Yeah, I was thinkin' egg and chips or a bacon sarnie, to be honest. What the bloody hell is that? Oh god. Oi oi. Billy, cover your eyes, we're married. Billy. Bruv. What you doing? Nothing.

They're always tryin' to kill each other, aren't they? With all this gang malarkey. Yeah, and what about all those stories you used to tell me about football hooligans and those crazy music festivals? You know, just 'cause it's not on the news doesn't mean it's not happening, Dad. Whatever. I'm off to a club tomorrow with Luke. - My Luke? - Your Luke. I didn't want to go, but he insisted. Said it'd make you happy. Yeah, that sounds like him. Wait, did you say club? Club.

You're fuckin' lot, that's who. You're all the fuckin' same. All of you's. We're not all the same, you know? You've got that interview, remember? Interview? What interview? Oh no, 'cause they canceled, love. They phoned and canceled. They didn't need me for it. You have always been crap at lying, Billy Pitcher. I know you're nervous. It's been a long time, but you'll be fine. You are more than qualified. I'll put the kettle on. Chin up. There. That's better. Now, remember, first impressions count. There's the man I married. Right, lovely. I gotta go. I don't wanna be late. Love you. 20 minutes, Bill, 20 minutes. We've gotta get home, come on. Is that the Enforcer gun? Oh yeah, man. It's awesome, isn't it? My dad got it for my birthday. Look at it. Oh, could I have a quick go? Sorry, my dad needs me. - Come on. - Sorry. Mom, can I have that? No Jayden. But that's the new Enforcer gun. Listen, you are a young Black male. You are not the same as most of your friends. White children don't get stopped by the police or have trouble findin' jobs when they're older, 'cause of their color. No Jayden. - But that's not fair. - No, I know. But that's just the way that it is. Am I right? Yeah, sure. Well that's bollocks, for a start. Most Black kids just don't wanna learn. That's all, they're lazy. They don't wanna learn. They just wanna be rappers or footballers or something. But nothin' to do with being bloody Black. Come, Jayden, let's go. Can I have a Nintendo Switch then instead? No, Jayden. Benjie's got one. Listen, I got you some books to read. More books. All right, son. Hey, how you doin'? Yeah, all right. You? Little bit nervous. I really don't like interviews, but hey, this is my ninth. You'd think I was used to it by now? Ninth, bloody hell. I'm under-qualified, - that's what that is. - Yeah. I heard he's a right tyrant. At least we got a call back. May the best man win. Trust me, it's not always the best man. Why are you lookin' at me? Can we have Mr. Seymour, please? That's me. Well, wish me luck, lads? Finally, he was in their bloody ages. Well, we might as well go home. Your man there was saying he has a diploma and degree. In what, business and finance? Plus he was working as last manager for nine years. - Him? - Nine years. Talk about a resume. That's impressive, but mine trumps his. I was workin' my last job 16 years. Good luck, lads. Well, that was quick. Must have skimmed his CV and given him the job. Mr. Pitcher, please. That's me. Good luck, mate. Thanks. Do come in. Thank you, Mr. Bryant. How, you doin', you all right? Do take a seat. - So, Mr. Pitcher. - That's me. Very impressive CV. - Thank you. - Thank you for coming. So, do you have what it takes to join ABC and Associate? 100%. And I wouldn't waste your time or mine. If you look at my CV, you'll see I'm more than qualified. Got many years of experience- Okay, well, thank you for coming down. We've got a few more people to see today, but we'll be in touch if you are successful. Thank you for coming. Are you... Are they havin' a laugh? First geezer was sittin' here for 30 minutes. I haven't been sat down for two minutes. Okay, well, sir- We'll be in touch. Thank you for coming. No you won't. Patsy, could you show the next person in please? Hello, mate, how are you? Thank you so much for coming. Listen, do you want tea or coffee? Patsy, do you... You all right, you sure? All right, how was your journey? Very good. Oh, good, it's lovely to see you. And thank you for taking your time to come in. Gotta say, obviously we've read everything. You would be... How can I help you today? I'm looking for something to go alongside my newly purchased Banksy, actually. - What are you thinking? - The perfect one for you here. It's called Eternal Journey. It's by Robbie Walters, and it's a steal at only 25,000 pounds. Hello, and welcome to my exhibition. I'm Braithwaite, but my friends call me BW. Champagne? - Thanks. - Thank you. Listen, if you see anything that you like or think you can afford, don't hesitate to come and let me know. Okay? Brilliant. Braithwaite? You know, I didn't know you like art. Because I'm Black? No silly, 'cause you're Luke. I'm jokin'. Yeah, I love this stuff. Ayesha Faisal, she's one of my favorite artists. Just look at the detail. Exquisite, isn't it? And this one is only 42,522 pounds. Only? Yes, it's my favorite. They call it On the Other Foot. It's meant to symbolize change, movement, and reflection. Okay, thank you, yeah. Yeah, it's funny. They're like servin' you sass. Oh gosh. You know what? I like that. 'Cause you can take their wool and you can make wool to do knitting. Yeah. - Or crochet, in my case. - Oh gosh. I've been thinking about your dad, you know? Yeah, how is he? What? What? No, I mean, what about him? I was just thinkin', he's not really racist, is he? He's more prejudice. I mean, he just doesn't like people of color. I mean, that's his choice. No, he's racist. Actually, he's both, I guess. He thinks White people are superior and don't like anything to do with Black people. I mean, it is fine not to like someone, but you don't have to be disrespectful. Anyway, how's Gavin doin'? Gavin? Oh my gosh. Do you really wanna know? Listen, Gavin's weird. Are darn, that's the phone. Yeah, back in a bit. Your friend's strange, man. - Why, what'd you mean? - He just don't get it. Thank you. Like, I must have said to him, "Oh, you must be used to getting bare girls "chasin' after you." He was like, "Why would I have "naked women chasin' after me?" No, no, no. Do you know what it was? It was when I asked him what's his heritage, and he was like, oh, I'm from England through and through. Which Black man is from England through and through? He's all right, I guess. Hello Mrs. Humphreys, how are you? I thought you was the decent type. In all my years. Mrs. Pitcher, I never thought you was a Jezebel. A what? What are you on about?

He's drunk, everyone. Look, it's raining, let's all just go inside. Come on, Gavin. Wait, there, I'm not Gavin. Look, I'm Billy. I'm not Gavin. Black people, you complain about slavery. And so they should, that they would jump into the sea. They did to escape. I used to look down on Black people. I did. But, after being Black, I started to realize that... What's what? What's it, Luke, what is it you call it? Being Black's lit. The food, the music, the culture, the women. They're amazing, they're lovely. Hey, yo, man's lean, bruv. It's rainin', I'm goin' inside. Wait, wait, wait, what, what? Claire, I'm so sorry. I've been horrible to Luke. You see Luke, listen, Luke. You are great boy for my daughter. Dad, what'd you put in the punch? He's drunk. Billy, Billy we ain't feelin' too good, mate. Thank you. Oh my head. Look at the state of me. Geez. Ha. Uh, ha. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Claire, wake up. Wake up, Claire. Wake up, look at me, look, look, look. I'm White. I'm White again. - What time is it? - I don't care. It doesn't matter. Look at me, I'm White. Look. You were cooler when you were Black. Don't gimme that old pony. I'm White again, Claire, I'm White. And listen, and the meeting's tonight, and you promised me you'd come. Don't let me down, lovey. Do not let me down. Ugh. Brenda, get a kettle on. He's gettin' up. Everyone's gotta put their two cents in, innit? I hope he's got a good one. Yeah, can I get your attention, please? I'll try and keep it brief. - It's just boring. - Can I get your attention, please, just. Just a bit of hush. Thank you. So some of you may know me. My name is Billy, Billy Pitcher. And I've been doing some thinkin'. So I wanna start by saying that I'm British and I'm proud. Here, here. But I wish we could just see the one color. That's right, White. Go on, Billy. I wish we could just see the color of love. Not Black, not White, just love. One universal color. Shut up, will ya? Listen, no, 'cause listen, we've been hypocrites, all of us. Me, you, all of us. And you, Fraser. - You what? - Yeah. Couple of weeks ago we went out for a bite to eat, didn't we? We said the food was some of the best we've ever had. Where did we go? Ah, what's it's name? Abdul's Curry House. Exactly, Indian. George, you support Chelsea, right? Yeah, have done since I was a kid. The old man used to take me. Yeah we both haven't we. But how many of our players are Black? And how many of them Black players have helped us win matches? Yeah, but that's different, - innit, mate? - Is it? See, I seen the way you leap out your seat when a Black player scores a goal. How 'bout you, Sean? How much money have you spent on fake tans? Oh. I mean, you claim to not like people of color, but you spend half your life tryin' to look darker. Justin. Justin. What? I know you was attacked the other week. Wasn't ya? And what? And what color was the geezer that stopped you gettin' your ass whooped? Was he White? He was Black. He was what? I said he was Black. He was Black. How about you, Mark? You had your car accident a couple of months ago. What was the color of the blokes that pulled you outta the wreckage? Well, they weren't good old White folk, were they? But they was still British. See what I'm sayin' is color is nothin'. It means nothin'. We're all the same. We bleed the same. We laugh the same. We hurt the same. And we love the same. Hold on. You lot are just gonna sit here and listen to this crap? Bill, you lost the plot or somethin'? Glen, have a word. Yeah, Bill, what's goin' on? Have you been drinkin'? I tell you what's goin' on, shall I? You got a daughter ain't ya? Just like mine. And would you rather she was with a person of color who loved her unconditionally, treated her like a queen, worshiped the ground she walks on? Or with a White bloke who sells drugs, degrades women, and has no morals? Yeah, see, I love Britain. I'll always love Britain. But I love the Britain I live in today and all that makes it great. And that includes all the other races. Wait until you can't get a job or an house, 'cause of all these lot. Just shut it, mate. Princess, we don't belong here. Let's go. Brandon. Ta da. It's a joke. Oh, Glen's up. Glen's up and about. Come on, Glen. I'm so proud of you two. I love you both. Love you, too, Dad. Oh, thank God. You can't. Reset one more. I'm not gonna let anyone, let alone your dad... Do you think I'm gonna let anyone, let... I'm gonna say it again. I'm gonna do it again. So, I'm just off for the barber's. I've gotta do that... Yeah, that's what I'm sayin'. Keep Britain... I was gonna say Black, sorry. - Sorry. - Sorry, that's my bad. Can we, sorry, can we repeat the lines? Mmm. Dad! Sorry. Wait, it was, you were the one who... Free practices right now, so if you need any... It's cold, innit? Oh. Wow, okay. I'm back to normal, Claire. Look at me, I'm White. Are you all right? I'm White, ha ha. Your name's not Claire, either. Never mind. - Claire. - No, it's not. I knew it. I knew I wasn't going mad. - She's such a... - After... - afternoon. - Hold on, hold on. How'd you know my name? I didn't say your name. Sorry. He's not cool with the whole Black and White thing, but he'll come around. Over my dead body.
