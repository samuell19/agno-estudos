Turn left, down the dirt track. The water château. REQUIEM FOR A VAMPIRE - Here. - Hurry up. - We've got plenty of time. What a job. - We've only got this one left. - It's a big one though. - Let's get out of here. - We haven't got much left to do. It's late. It wouldn't have taken us long. Now we'll have to come back tomorrow. It's getting dark. Are you superstitious? No, but you never can tell at night. - So my little ones, who are you? - We ran away. - From a New Year's party. - We were clowns. - We killed a man. - We jumped over the wall. - Our friend was waiting in the car. - We were followed. - He was killed. - We got Lost. Eternally Lost. We've come back to the château. This way. All paths lead back to the château. We're prisoners. It's already late. They'll come back. Let's go to the cemetery. Our men will soon be back from their hunting. In the meantime, we have these two. They will be ours. They're young. They're virgins. They will serve us, then be initiated. They'll perpetuate our race. Give them to Louise. They must be told what awaits them and what they must do. That man in the cemetery is the last vampire. His powers have diminished through the ages. Little by little, he passes on the blessed malediction. One day, maybe tomorrow, we will be like him. Erica has already developed teeth. Already we find daylight painful. You have been blessed with the divine bite of the vampire. You'll remain normal for a while. But soon you too will only be able to go out at night. You will be initiated. You have to be initiated. You cannot be both virgin and vampire. In the meantime, you can help us. You can still gout in daylight. Tomorrow, you will hunt for us. You will find victims for us. By tomorrow night, you must lure our prey to the château. What are you doing? Who are you? - I live in the château over there. - The château? I didn't know there was a château here. - Does it belong to your parents? - I have no parents. I live alone. - All alone, at your age? - All alone. I hunt to feed myself. I'll never leave that château. I'll stay there all my life. - That's hard to believe. Show me. - Don't go there. Why not? I live alone too. I have plenty of time. Come on. Here it is. - You should go now. - Why? Because you're pleasant and - - Don't go in there. - What's going on? - Before you - I want you to make love to me before you go into the château. I want to do it with you, for the first and last time before it gets dark. It's getting dark. Quick, you must hide. I'll explain later. Who are you? Please help me. I'm hurt. He's yours. Drink his blood. - Did you capture anyone? - No. I didn't see anyone. It's dark. It's time to leave. - Leave? Tonight, you'll be fully initiated. Our master is expecting you. I don't feel very well. Perhaps tomorrow. You'll feel better afterwards. Come. We shall all share your experience. Go, my child. What's the matter? Are you afraid? No, I'm not afraid. - You're my friend, aren't you? - Of course I am. - I don't understand, he'll only - - I know. See you later. Are you all right? Yes, but my friend is acting strangely. - We must catch her. - Why? She's not a virgin. She was yesterday. The master can tell. It wasn't any of my men. That means someone's hiding in the château. Find them, quickly. He's in there. He never leaves the cemetery. Impossible. Go into the mausoleum. There's blood all around the coffin. I'll go look. You want to kill me? Why? You bear my mark, after all. I know you don't want to be part of our existence. You're afraid of the vicious men and cruel women. You want to save that young man who's Locked up in the mausoleum. Let him go. He mustn't die. Don't worry, he won't die. In spite of my powers, my remaining days are numbered. All this will soon be gone. I'll tell you a secret. You must keep it to yourself. None of them will become what I am. My powers are too ancient. Only Erica has started to change. The change will never be complete. I'm the last vampire and the race will die with me. But why? Why this bloody and murderous existence? I didn't choose it. It's their nature. They're wild and barbaric. They support me. Thanks to them, I have the impression I'm alive. When I'm gone, they will give up this life. The sun is rising. I must go now. Have faith. - Why? - You've hidden someone. Where is he? You know I love you as much as you Love me. We ran away together and I will always Love you. But I need to know where he is. He could be the ruin of us all. You will tell me. Even if I have to make you suffer and I suffer as much as you. If you don't tell me, they'll kill us both when they return tonight. Do what you want. I won't be angry. Tell me where he is. You have to tell me, do you hear me? Why are you making me hurt you? Forgive me. I have to do it. I won't let you die. Well? I can't go on. She won't tell me. Let them go. They will lead us to him. Put her clothes back on. You're free to go. - Quick. He's in there. - Go and find him. - What's going on? - Hurry, we're being attacked. - Let's look in the coffin. - No. Quick, up there. You dragged me into this, you little bitch. So you're their accomplice. Let them go. It's over. The men are dead now. Erica, you're becoming the same as me. Come here. We will never leave this tomb again. There'll be an end to crimes and bloodshed. It's all over. You will guard this tomb. It must never be opened again. Later, you will bury our remains and seal the entrance. Then you'll be free. Come now, it's time.
