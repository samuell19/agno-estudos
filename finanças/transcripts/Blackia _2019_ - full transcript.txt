Hello! Hello, Sardar Sahib. What brings you here? Don't worry about your work, I'm on it. Did you get anything from them? They have consumed more than what we found on them, sir. I want you to book them for 25 percent of it and give me the rest. Don't you think this sum is less compared to the quantity of those goods? Don't forget that you are posted here because of me. DSP wants to give your post to one of his men. I am at your mercy, sir. Just keep providing me with your protection. Money is nothing, it's just a means to an end. You can keep this as well. Did they say who their boss is? They are small time smugglers. Their boss collects the goods in the middle of the night. Then he must be waiting for them somewhere. Okay, so it's you. The one you are waiting for are at the police station. Billa, shoot him. Send him to his maker. I too know how to send people to their maker, Gajjan Singh. But I don't want bloodshed. Who are you? You are not from here. I am from here, but I went to Dubai when I was young. You look the part. What made you so crazy that you've come to confront your enemy? Businessmen don't confront, they make deals. Gajjan Singh, this is a big business.. ..and if we get together we can make it bigger. We are close to the border. We don't make business deals here. You are talking about getting together.. We even kill people for 10 grams of gold. Fine, if you don't want to do business together.. ..then let's make our territories. You don't come in my path and I won't come in yours. Everyone one from the peon to the minister here are in my pocket. Not even a needle can cross the border without my permission. Get this straight. You better go back to where you came from. Or I'll bury right here. Let's go! Sir, he's a tough not to crack. Gajjan is a tree that doesn't let any plant sprout under it. Go and find out, there has to be someone who can outsmart him. Brother, let me take my cycle atleast. Why are you pushing me? Listen to me. - What happened? - Got insulted. We won't be getting it on credit now. Didn't you take my name? - Didn't you say Jaggar Singh wants it? - I did. That's why he threw me out. Damn them! - Uncle, uncle! - How dare he to insult Jaggar Singh? - Uncle, uncle! - Leave me. Don't end up breaking a liquor bottle. We don't even have enough to buy ourselves a drink.. ..how will you pay for the bottle? I feel worthless now. You are worth a lot. But you don't know how to cash it. Will you work for me? First tell me what I need to do. Are you offering me a drink because you want to get someone killed? Something like that. But you won't refuse to do the job after you hear his name. What's his name? Your old enemy. Gajjan. Gajjan? What do you have to do with Gajjan? The same as you. We are enemies. And enemy of an enemy is an ally. I heard you and Gajjan were like brothers? Brothers? I was his father in this business. As river changed its course, my land had gone barren. I couldn't resort to begging so I found another way feed myself. The path that took me across the border. The Gajjan you are talking about.. ..used to sit on the floor and make drinks for me. Pour me a drink. Okay. Why are you being such a miser? - Make it large. - Okay, brother. Enough! [children playing] Didn't father ask you not to? - Here son, buy yourself some marbles. - Don't you dare! Jaggar's son won't play with glass marbles.. ..he'll play with metal bullets. Come here, my boy. Sit down. Take this. Why are you so scared? It's just a toy. Here, hold it. Here's the trigger. Pull the trigger and game over. If you wanted him dead.. ..then why didn't you just strangle him when he was born? Why are you getting so upset? I'm making him brave. You've already turned into a monster.. ..now don't you dare make my son follow your path. Let's go, son. Go and study hard. Don't listen to him. Cubs of lion are bound so hunt. Try your best in doing otherwise. Let's go, Gamma. Sun's about to set. What are you looking at? The border. Sukha, don't you wish to see what's over there? Son, your questions' answers cannot be found in these books. You'll find them once you cross the border. Tell me, do you wish to come along? But what about mother? Don't worry about her. We'll leave tonight and be back before your mother wakes up. Let's go. - Hello, brother. - Hello. Come on, let's go. Brother, don't you think Gamma is too young for such a dangerous job? You need a heart of steel while doing the business of gold. If only he learns to understand the border now.. ..can he rule over all others in future. Let's go, son. Gamma what are you looking? This is the border? What did you think, that you'll have to jump a wall? Our teacher says that Pakistan is poorer than us. Then from where do they get so much gold? Son, this gold isn't from Pakistan, it comes from gulf countries. Cheap gold brought in from gulf countries.. ..is sold here at double the price. Okay? Let's go. - Greetings. - Greetings. Father, you get so much gold by exchanging just one note? Son, it's its number that is valuable and not its denomination. For the right number.. ..you get the right price for the goods anywhere in the world. What is it called? Yes, Hawala. Hawala? What's that? It doesn't concern us. Our job is to risk our life and make the goods cross the border. Let the businessmen handle the business end. Let's go, son. Let's go, my boy. It's gold, Lala. Show it some respect. Gold is precious, trust isn't. Take this. Why are you counting it? I won't cheat you. Well done, Lala. Different rules for different people? Well, it's in my blood. Like it's in your blood to be vicious. Look at your boy. He's already knows the tricks of the trade. Lala.. He's still raw. You just wait and watch. One day my son shall rule this city. Here son, is your first income. You will get a big note for every trip we make. From where did you get this money? Yes? Where did you get this money from? Where? Tell me! I have so many dreams for you! - And you are doing all this? - Mother! Do I send you to school to do this? - You want to all this? - I made a mistake. - You want to all this? - I made a mistake. Stop hitting, brother. Stay away or you'll get thrashed as well. - Tell me, you want to follow your father's path? - What are you doing? - You want to follow your father's path? - Let him go! What is wrong? Do you want to kill him? It's you who wants to kill him? Are you his enemy? I am his father, that's why I teaching him the tricks. Our barrens lands won't help him feed himself. And such things are the right things to do to feed oneself? I'll take up a labour job and educate him. I'll educate him and make him take up a respectable job. Mind your own business. Ms. Goody-two-shoes. Let's go, son. Come. Get this straight, Gamma.. If you follow your father tonight.. ..then you'll lose your mother forever. Let her babble. Come with me. Let's go. Remember my son.. ..you will never live happy without me. It must be hurting, right? I am sorry, son. Why are you crying, mother? - It was my mistake. - Dear. After getting beaten up by you I feel like I've atoned myself. BSF has increased patrolling of the border. Take the gold and leave. Bloody idiot! You want to shoot the soldiers? Blockhead! Take the gold and leave. I'll evade them and come. I spent seven years in prison because Gajjan betrayed me. You never tried to take revenge from him? How would I? Neither did my body nor did my son support me. Why? Where is your son? In prison. In prison? Tahal Singh, you look unwell. Let me do this. You go to the hospital and get some medicines before lockdown. Now go. Go. Thank you bother. He makes my blood boil. Why? I sent two months in solitary because of him. Don't worry, do you want us to teach him a lesson? Let's go. Today I will not spare him. What are you waiting for, go for it! What are you waiting for, come on. Move. Move. Hot blooded aren't you! You itching for solitary? No, sir. It's not his fault. He saved my life. Carry on then! - Come. - Get back to your cells! Thank you, son. A person who respects a turban cannot be a bad person. What brought you here? Who says you need to do be bad person to come here? You aren't a bad person either. What are you doing here? The son of a patriot is getting punished for being a traitor. My only fault was that I asked for Punjab's rights..from Delhi. Enough about me. Tell me, what brought you here. You look educated. Mother! Mother! Where is mother? What is it, brother? - Where's mother? - What's wrong, son? Nothing's wrong mother, don't worry. - Let me read this for you. - You scared me. Nothing to be scared about. Let me show you something. Okay. Read this. Trying to make fun of your mother? You know I can't read to save my life. You read it out for her. Admission? Mother, it states that brother got admission in a college. He will also get state stipend. Really! Give that here. Where's it written? Today is the first time I regret not being about to read and write. Father! Look, brother got admission a college. So? He just got an admission. It's not like he won an award. Mother.. I need rupees to buy books for college. Don't worry, I've already arranged for that. You should only concentrate on your studies. You should set an example before the world. Move aside, its brakes don't work. Why don't they work? My father gave you a new one, when you shamelessly demanded it. Now you say that the brakes don't work. Shut your trap or we'll have an accident. - Hey brother..! - What are you doing? Sit properly. Oh come on, are you blind? Can't you see? Did you get my car to die? Bloody villagers! Drive. Hey! How dare you follow me to college! I think I'll have to call the police now. What have I done now? Look at him acting innocent. He asks, "what have I done now." What's this commotion about? Sir, he followed me here from the market. Couldn't you find another chick to follow? How can you be so crass, sir? You are a professor, sir. Don't you have any shame? Professor? Who are you addressing as professor? Ma'am, sir.. He looks like a professor to you? He has spent three years in each class.. ..and has finally managed to reach the final year. Mayself.. Sharan Singh. Anyhow, what is the matter? Ma'am, he followed me here. I didn't know the way to college. I thought she is going to college so I followed her. I have been admitted here. Here, take a look. - I received this letter. - You in this college? Have you seen yourself in a mirror? You dress like a truck driver. Behave! District topper? Yes. You must have misunderstood. He is an intelligent boy. No ma'am, I saw him staring at me. No ma'am, I didn't. I don't even know that she has long hair. I didn't stare at her. Anyhow, did you hear what he said? He didn't even look at you. Guys, go to your classes. All of you! Come on! Saw that? No, I didn't. That girl is lying. I am not talking about that girl. I am talking about ma'am. She looks just like Mumtaz. I don't feel like clearing the exams because of her. Brother, you might not want to, but I do. - See you. - Hey, listen up.. What are you looking for? Something to admire. That's Sheetal. He looked like such an idiot! Oh, are you two related? No, but I wish to. He looked like such an idiot! Hello, Sheetal. Remember me? I'm Billa. I keep visiting your shop. So what? I can't say about you, but I really like you. Really? How much do you like me? More than my life. More than even your parents? Much more. Oh my! More than even your sister? I don't have a sister. But if I had one then even more than her. Oh.. If you like me more than your sister then you should be my brother. He did manage to get related to her. Hey hello. Still following me? No, I wasn't following you. I was going back to my village. Crazy. No one should be so beautiful. The whole college is crazy about her. Hey! What are you doing? Brother, if I add little water to milk at this hour.. ..then I can add little alcohol into water in the evening. That's why people complain to mother.. ..that they find more frogs than cream in the milk we provide. How will they find any cream? The frogs eat all the cream. You have no shame, do you? Please don't tell aunt about it. She will turn me black and blue. Fine, I won't. But you shouldn't do this again. Whatever you say. Why do I need to do it? It's not like I cannot survive without it. Let's go. Why are you all smiles? I've started going to college. College? What's that? A place where girls and boys study. Girls and boys steal hearts there? Did any girl get yours? Stop smiling and tell me. The matchmaker has brought a proposal. He is handsome. He works in a mill. But they want a cycle and a wristwatch. He works in a mill. He's not government official. No way. We will find a better match. There is no flaw in our daughter. There is no flaw in our daughter. The flaw lies in her father. We have to face refusal as they hear your name Gajjar Blackia, the smuggler. We cannot keep her here just because of a cycle and a wristwatch. Now also tell me where will you arrange for it? Are you planning to sell the barren land? I expect nothing from you or your barren land. I'll manage on my own. Your son is old enough now. You should ask him to start working. So that you get what you want. Don't expect anything from him. He's getting his heart stolen. Shut up. Don't make me hit you. Why are you worry, father? Let me complete my education.. ..then my mother will lead a luxurious life. Education? This is right age to start earning. You shouldn't be wasting it behind books. You shoudn't waste time studying.. ..you can waste your life in prison though. Who are you taunting? Yes, I went to prison. Is it a crime? Who says so? Police took you because they like you a lot. You.. Eight. Let's go. Give order of goods without hesitation. Policeman will deliver you himself. - Okay. - Okay? Let's go. Bye. Daddy! You daughter is back. Go home, dear. I'll join you soon. Okay. Mummy! You are back! - How was your first day in college? - It was great. - Oh really? - What did you do? - Well, what will I do? - You are back, sister! You are still at home? Why didn't you go to school? I don't feel going there today. Mummy, he's scared of going to school. Leave him alone. He doesn't need to go to school. He has to take over the shop anyway. 'No, I didn't stare at her.' 'I don't even know that she has long hair.' Idiot. 'Have you seen yourself in a mirror?' 'You dress like a truck driver.' What are you thinking about, son? Nothing mother, just.. Here, quickly have some milk. Son, have you given marriage a thought? It's hot, mother. Why do I need to think about it when I have you? I'll handle everything. But some arrangements need to be made. So soon? It's not soon enough, son. We can't wait till the last moment. The groom's family has given us only two months. Okay. You are talking about Shindi's wedding. What did you think, about Sukhi's wedding? Son, tomorrow go and get the groom's ring size. We need to it to make a ring for him. Okay. - Mother! - Yes. I cannot go to college wearing such clothes. I want to get a few pants and shirts stitched. - You already have so many. - But they are all old-fashioned. A new style is in fashion these days, bellbottoms. The ones Dharamendra and Amitabh Bachchan wear. I want those. Fine, go and buy them from the shop. I'll settle the bill. Okay. Gamma? Go to Lala Rashan Lal for the ring. He might not be a lawful businessman but he is a good craftsman. Clean the table, Chotu. I have left a message at the gate of the mill. - He will be here soon. - Okay. What's this? You ate all the fritters? You should have waited for him. Do you want to eat the plate as well? - Where's your patience? - It had half eaten that. Sharing makes the heart more founder. It's very tasty. Who is he? The one for whom your heart should feel more founder. Him? How are you, Gamma? - Hello, brother. - Hello. Why aren't you having anything? Give him something to eat. He has eaten enough. He had so many fritters that he had to spit some out. - Let me take your ring size. - Sure. Bring it forth. There you go. And it's done. Sukhi, you order something for him. I'll go and give the size to Lala before he leaves for lunch. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Deepi, your sister's marriage was fixed, right? - What happened? - I forgot to tell you. Soon the groom's family will fix the wedding date. - Really. - We will have a lot of fun. I hope they come up with a date soon. We will have a lot of fun. Look your district topper. He was staring at you with such affection. He's still following me. Look at this. Brother I have some more colors. Hey! - Yes. - Where to? I think I'll have to send you to prison. No, Dharamendra.. What is this? A black thread! He is doing black magic to trap me. No, I was going to give the size of the wedding ring. He is already talking about the wedding ring. Wedding ring size? I'd rather give you my shoe size! You misunderstand. You know the goldsmith Lala? The fat guy. I was going to his place.. ..to give the ring size for my sister's wedding. He is my father. Okay. He is a very nice man. He makes great jewellery. I'm going to his shop. "Silky tresses.." "Intoxicating eyes.." "They give me a reason to live." Who was that? This is a classroom and not a movie theatre. Everyone pretends to be Dharamendra here. No one will act like a hero in my class. Do you understand? What will you not act like? A hero! Mind it! Won't you address him as a truck driver now? Mr. Dharamendra, please don't steal my Mumtaz. When I can't charm the one I like how will I charm your girl? It will work only if you talk to her. But I don't understand, how do I talk to her? So students, our topic for the day is letter drafting. Can anyone define it? - Ma'am. - Yes. Letter drafting is an art. Those who cannot vocally express their feelings.. ..can express them by penning them down. That's called letter drafting. What are you doing? Letter drafting. What's that? When cannot vocally express your feelings.. ..you can express them by penning them down. That's called letter drafting. Our cattle bathe in this water. Don't spoil our cattle with your English letters. Or else in the even when we go to milk them they'll say.. no! Do you love anyone? Of course I do, every day. My buffalo, its calf loves me the most. Now that's true love. I don't even give him any milk. Have you ever loved a girl? You shouldn't discuss such things with kids. It is even possible. I too didn't believe in it earlier, Sukhi. But it's true. He has smiling again. Who is she? How beautiful is she? "She glows like the sun." "A strand of hair falls on her face." "She glows like the sun." "A strand of hair falls on her face." "One look at her and I couldn't take my eyes off." "This is the first time I've come across a life size sugar toy." "This is the first time I've come across a life size sugar toy." "This the first time.." "She makes me lose my senses when she looks back at me." "She makes me lose my senses when she looks back at me." "I wonder who will she will say yes to." "She is beautiful, she is bound to have attitude." "I wonder who will she will say yes to." "She is beautiful, she is bound to have attitude." "She is as delicate and light as a flower." "This is the first time I've come across a life size sugar toy." "This is the first time I've come across a life size sugar toy." "This the first time.." Let's go in class. 'Sheetal, I am doing good here.' 'And I pray to God that you are doing well as well.' 'Moving on, although I am not scared of anyone..' '..but I get petrified when I come in front of you.' 'That's why I am writing this letter.' 'Honestly speaking, I unknowingly followed you the first time.' 'But now I wish to do so on purpose.' 'But I don't want you to get a bad name in college.' 'Can you be at the company garden at 1:00pm on Saturday?' 'If you don't want to..' '..then please don't complain about this to the principal. 'See you. Bye.' - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. - Not attending the class today? - I'll be right behind you. Okay. Oh my! Hema Malini's letter for Dharamendra? Give me that letter. Let me find out what does a love letter contain. Give me that letter. What will you do if I don't? You'll hit me? You will fight with me? Hit me. Are you scared? Yes, I am scared. I knew it. He is such a coward. Everyone is scared of me. Including you. Do you know why am I scared? I'll beat you up, but you will be back with your monkeys tomorrow. I'll beat you up again and you'll be back again. I am scared of such vicious circles. Who are you addressing as monkeys? If this is the case Gamma.. ..then now this letter will be displayed on the notice board. Now you will be the one who will hand that letter over to me. What will you do? What will you do? No! Gamma! Please, let me go. Let me go. I will never mess with you again. I still don't understand who exactly are you! Keep it down. Mr. Gurnam Singh, I thought you were a decent man. Why? Did I write anything wrong in the letter? Oh, look at his naivety. Yesterday he was fighting like he is a notorious hooligan. And in the letter he says he is scared of me. By the way, what are you scared of? I fear that I might end up hurting your feelings. Or you might get a bad name in college because of me. I.. I want to see love for me in your eyes. And not anger. Does the government pay you for coughing? Are you going to dig a channel here? Find another place. I'm not digging a channel. I'm building a barrier so that water doesn't spill over. [music playing on radio] Stop the music! Why did you get up? I promised I won't mess with you. So, you tell me. What have I done, man? The place where you are sitting is mine. What are you doing! I'll shoot, Gamma! - Gamma! - Go ahead and shoot! One look is enough for me to learn how loaded a weapon.. ..or how strong a person is. I am saying it in simple words. Sheetal is standing over there. I love her more than my own life. Now imagine, what a person who can die for love.. ..will do to those who obstruct his path? I'll see you later. You cannot say it to my face! How will you shoot at my chest? After all you are Gajjan's son. You! Let me stick to my mother's teaching. If my vicious father's blood starts talking.. ..then no hospital will be able repair your bones. Get lost! You don't know my father. The father whose support makes you soar so high.. ..learnt to fly from my father. Go and tell him you've messed up with Jaggar's son. Go on. "Tell me, o my beloved.." "How much do you love me?" "Tell me, o my beloved.." "How much do you love me?" "Count the stars in the sky.." "Count the stars in the sky.." "That's how much I love you." "Tell me, o my beloved.." "How much do you love me?" "You can test my love, whenever you want." "I too claim, I can dance on glass for you." "You can test my love, whenever you want." "I too claim, I can dance on glass for you." "Gather all the water in the world.." "That's how much I love you." "Tell me, o my beloved.." "How much do you love me?" So someone's dreaming big! He is very stubborn. I tried to reason it with him. Then I threatened him. But he didn't give in. How can I? He's Jaggar's flesh and blood. He is dreams of becoming Lala's son-in-law. Don't be upset, Lala. - Tell me, should I get rid of him? - No, you won't do this. I don't want anyone to get a hint of this. And then, why use poison when sugar can kill as well? I'll talk to him. Is it necessary to always use violence? Gamma! - Yes. - Get in son, I want to talk to you. Come on, get in. Drive. You are Jaggar, the smuggler's son, right? You were at my shop the other day, weren't you? What is Jaggar doing these days? I think he is out of prison, isn't he? You have no land or wealth. Anyway, you cannot expect much from a crippled. Sheetal needs a car when she steps out of the house. She won't step out without a car. Forget sitting in a car, you don't even deserve to stand next to one. You should know where you stand and leave my daughter alone. Stop the car. I said, stop the car. 'Forget sitting in a car, you don't even deserve to stand next to one.' 'You should know where you stand and leave my daughter alone.' Where were you? I've been looking for you. Why? What happened? You know Roopi's sister's wedding has been fixed. I heard her husband is very rich. He has a big bungalow and a big car. What happened? Why are you so quite? Sheetal, I am from a very poor family. I don't have enough for keep you happy, to fulfil your dreams. You are not my dream, you are my love. Love isn't enough. I am confident about your capabilities. I know that you'll come in a big car to pick me up.. And I'll come running towards you and give you a hug. What if I cannot manage to get a big car? - Then? - Sheetal? Let's go, we need to go to the market as well. Gamma, you must attend my sister's wedding. "There are many who are after me." "They all try their best to woo me." "There are many who are after me." "They all try their best to woo me." "But my taste is a little different." "Your simplicity won me over." "My attitude is a force to reckon with." "But a look from you and it got crushed." "My attitude is a force to reckon with." "But a look from you and it got crushed." "We cannot survive without each other." "World has always been an enemy of love." "We cannot survive without each other." "World has always been an enemy of love." "I promise to always be there for you." "You should treasure me, I'm one in a million." "Nothing in this world can stop me.." "Just don't let go of my hand." "Nothing in this world can stop me.." "Just don't let go of my hand." "The fault lies in my eyes.." "My heart and my mind, both support you." "The fault lies in my eyes.." "My heart and my mind, both support you." "I feel as if the ground beneath me is moving.." "I am so high in your love." "My attitude is a force to reckon with." "But a look from you and it got crushed." "My attitude is a force to reckon with." "But a look from you and it got crushed." "I've made you the owner of my heart." "We are meant to be together." "I've made you the owner of my heart." "We are meant to be together." "Those who are staring at us with ill intentions.." "You should know you cannot stop us." "Nothing in this world can stop me.." "Just don't let go of my hand." "My attitude is a force to reckon with." "But a look from you and it got crushed." "Nothing in this world can stop me.." "Just don't let go of my hand." You are thick-skinned, aren't you? You didn't heed my warning. Lala ji, I had thought of removing Sheetal from my life. Then I saw that Sheetal loves me a lot. And I cannot break her heart. You are asking for the impossible. Notice the difference between our statuses. Don't worry, Lala ji. I'll come for your daughter only after I can match up with your status. Okay. Bye. Bye. Lala ji, you don't worry. I'll talk to Sheetal. You wouldn't dare. She shouldn't learn about this. You never know when you lose control over your kids these days. I'll teach him a lesson. Here's 110 rupees. - Bye. - Bye. What was that? You were so close to her. How could you sell her? I'm sold her with a heavy heart. I have nurtured her like my own kid. It is not easy to get your daughters married these days. You need to make many sacrifices. You won't understand. It's earlier to preach than to act. A cycle and a wristwatch! Even the well to do ones cannot afford them. Anyway, you cannot gather enough by selling the cattle. I've already arranged for a cycle and a wristwatch. This was for feeding the wedding guests and jewellery. From where did you get so much money? It's my lifetime's hard-earned money. It's not something earned through illicit means. It's hard-earned money that's why it took you a lifetime to earn. I would have managed to get that much in just one trip. But I.. Don't you already vent enough of you anger on it? You've earned that as well. Father, please don't start fighting again. I am not fighting, dear. I was just saying that she should save her earnings. Why do I need to save it? I'll go to the city with Gamma tomorrow and buy the gifts for her weddings. Oh my God! So many people! I'd once come to the city with your father, before you were born. There were hardly any people on the road back then. You say as if only you had a child and no one else did. Shut up. Stop joking. Let's go to the market. We will get the gold from the jeweller on the way back. Let's go. Sukha, we cannot take mother to the jeweller. I don't get along well with the jeweller. If he says anything to mother then we'll get into trouble. Come up with something. Mother shouldn't go there. Aunt, we need to buy clothes as well, right? We need to the jeweller too to get the gold. Give the money to Gamma, he will get it. But I too want to see it. Mother, I'll be getting it at home. You can look at it then. In the meanwhile, you buy clothes and make other arrangements. It will save time. I'll quickly go and.. Give me the money. - Fine. - I'll go and get it. If we spend the whole day here then when will I tend to the cattle? Yes, he is absolutely right. - Be careful. - Okay. Let's go buy a watch first. - See you. - Okay. Look at this. Okay? Enmity and business are two different things. I'm sure you have understood what I was trying to say the other day. You are smart. Count them. I don't need to count. I'm sure you must have paid in full. Wait a minute. It's meant for a bride, don't spoilt them.. ..I'll put them in a box for you. Take this. What's this? - My sister's jewellery. - Let me check them. It's my sister's wedding jewellery. - Lakha, check it. - Okay, sir. If its jewellery then we will return them. Why would we want to take them? Gold bars, sir. They aren't mine. I think Lala ji.. They belong to him. He came to me to sell them illegally. But you know that I don't do illegal deals. - Why are you lying, Lala ji? - I don't know, son. Handcuff him. - Why are you lying, Lala ji. I.. - I don't know anything. Stop them, father. He is a very nice boy. He cannot do such a thing. Mother, we study in the same college. My dear, I know him very well. I know how nice and decent he is. His father too was into the same business. - Take him away. - Get into the jeep! He's not our son-in-law to have privileges of sitting in a jeep. Take him on foot. So that the whole city finds out how Inspector.. ..Bhagail Singh treats such criminals. - Let's go. - Come on. Sheetal! Sukha, isn't he Gamma? Yes, he is aunt. Inspector, why did you arrest my innocent son? There comes the advocate of his innocence. Your darling son was caught selling illegal gold to Lala. No! Stay away! Let's go. Emergency is on. I can keep you behind bars without any documentation. I can also shoot you and throw your body into the river. Beg for mercy and sir might feel generous. I know him quite well. It's no use talking to someone who wags his tail for every morsel. You are.. You are quite poisonous. I think I'll have to defang you. He is Jaggar's son. He is bound to be poisonous. What was he saying, Billa? If his vicious father's blood starts talking.. ..then no one will be able to control him. Now I show him my true colours. What did you say to me the other day? That I cannot attack you on your chest. Do something. Get him out of his grip! Help! He will kill him! Control him! Hurry up, you scoundrels. Release him! Control him! Let him go! My son will chock! Try harder! Hold him down. Let him go! Let him go, Gamma! Take him inside. What was he saying? Take him inside. Take him. Lakha, come on, one more time. I am sorry, sir. He is thick-skinned. All the batons at the police station have broken. I think one of us will lose our lives while trying to make him confess. He isn't going to confess. Why won't he? Even his forefathers would accept it. I sister can get married without a brother but not without jewellery. Come on, let's make a deal. All you have to do is sign on this paper and accept that you are a smuggler. And I will send this jewellery to your house. So you are finally showing your true colours. You are used to backstabbing. How can I trust you? You have no other option. You have to choose between your life and your sister's life. 'Court sentences Gurnam Singh son of Jaggar Singh from village Gulabapaihni..' '..five years imprisonment for illegally smuggling gold.. ..under section 25 of the customs act.' Gamma? Mother, I have been trapped. I am innocent. Innocent? After setting your mother's dream on fire, you call yourself innocent? I had just two dreams. To get you educated and get your sister married. You fool, you ruined your sister's life along with yours. Amar's mother called off the wedding because of the jewellery. Gajjan didn't give you the jewellery? So you have joined Gajjan? You were guilty and that's why you didn't let me go to the jeweller's shop. Because this is what you intended all along. - But.. - Enough! Enough of that, son. If you want to repay me for nurturing you.. ..then never show me your face again. I will assume that I never had a son. Take him along. Have faith in God, Gamma. Everything will be fine. Gurnam Singh! Jailer wants to meet you. Why? What's wrong? Don't worry. He is going out on bail. The food served in prison is not any good. Why don't you eat something first. You got me out of prison. And you are offering me food and refreshments. Can I know the reason behind these favours? I am businessman. I don't do favours. I make investments. That too which benefit everyone. You want money to make your mother happy and to get your sister married. And you want revenge. I can fulfil all your needs. And what do I need to do in exchange? Whatever you can, to destroy Gajjan. I heard as a child you've played the game Jaggan is an expert in. Then you also know that I've walked away from that path long back. You cannot walk away from that path, ever. All the other paths have closed down for you. Now the world knows you as a Blackia, a smuggler. I don't care what the world thinks about me. I cannot break the trust my loved ones have in me. Gamma.. You are saying no to him? You would have rotten in prison if he hadn't bailed you out. He has gone you a huge favour. I agree I cannot repay your favour. But I will repay you back what I owe you, one day. Gamma! You don't worry. I'll talk to him. It's okay. Let him test his belief. Sheetal.. I don't talk to criminals. You don't believe me anymore? I believed in you a lot. Sheetal, I.. Listen to me. I am here to justify myself. - Hey! - Listen to me. Let go of my daughter's hand. How dare you! Let it go! Just because you got arrested in front of my house.. ..it doesn't mean that I am behind your arrest. You have come here to seek revenge from my daughter? It's people like you who cheat to take revenge. I am talking to Sheetal. So, just stand here quietly. - Sheetal.. - You don't have the status to talk to my daughter. Fifthly blood. Your father was a smuggler. Who knows where your mother came from. If you dare say a word against my mother, I'll break your neck. - Let him go! - Do you understand? Let my father go! How dare you raise your hand on my father! People was right, you are.. What did they say? What did they say? That I am a smuggler? Then your father is one too! He deceitfully trapped me! You are lying. Father didn't know anything about you. Here I was, crazy about you.. Let's go. "Your nose ring tells me.." "You always meant to cheat me." "Oh beautiful, you always meant to cheat me." "You liar, you always meant to cheat me." "The necklace around my neck tells me.." "We are going be separated now." "Oh beautiful, we are going be separated now." "Oh sweetheart, we are going be separated now." Sir, Gamma is here. So? Enjoyed the world? It isn't meant for a decent man. Now if I've to survive out here, I'll have to change my ways. So, what have you decided? Gajjan's destruction begins from today. It's not so easy, Gamma. Politicians, police, goons.. All the people needed to run this business side Gajjan. You can only be a circus lion if you take support, Mr. Cheema. And to be the jungle lion, you only need your own support. - Gulzar. - Yes. On then.. ..it will be my money and your courage. Here. Rule the place. Gold is high in demand during festivals. My father used to haul the most during those days. Gajjan is my father's pupil after all. Rethink about it. Inspector personally escorts his goods to the border. His jurisdiction begins where border ends. We will steal at the border. Even if one of us shoot, the last bullet will be shot by the BSF. None of us will survive. Why don't we fight instead? Fighting doesn't help anyone either. Just give us your bags and go back home. Sure, we will give you our bags. I'll shout and call the border force! Let it go. I have a loud voice, let me go. Let me go. Who is this fledgling in my area who doesn't fear death? What about my gold? This is not about gold, it's about my respect. You are worried about your respect? That gold is worth 500,000, I want it back. Is it Karma? The one whose brother we had killed in an encounter. No, he doesn't step out, out of fear. He hasn't even appealed for bail. Then it must be Gola. Sitting here and guessing won't help us find my gold. Do something, inspector. Inspector, arrest everyone in this area who knows this business. This inspector is on Gajjan's payroll. He is hitting obstacles just like a blind bull would. Gamma, you have stepped on a snake's tail. It will bite you for sure. If I know how to step on a snake's tail.. ..then I also know how to defang a snake. The wounds are still fresh, he is bound to growl in pain. In the meanwhile, I'll perform my duty. His is the key to your cycle and a wristwatch. Give it to aunt. Brother, I know you are a nice man. But keep one thing in mind, my sister should never lack anything. One more thing. Mother should not know that we gave these to you. This is my gift. What's that? Drive the cycle slowly after drinking this.. ..otherwise, you'll end up crossing the border. Don't worry, brother. Brother, you have settled this. But now how will we give the money for wedding to mother? Here, 1000 rupees. I'll pay you the rest after the transfer documents of the land are ready. Look brother, we might be in desperate need of money.. ..but we don't want to lie in order to make this deal with you. Our land is filled with sand, it's barren. I know. I am not going to use it for farming. I am going to open a poultry farm there. Take this. You should prepare the documents. I'll get going now. See you. - Bye. - Bye. Take this. See, God finds a way to help honest people. First the groom's family agreed and then God sent us this money. I don't understand who would have dared to take our gold. We have just taken his gold for now. Next time we will go for territory. Gajjan isn't a kid, Gamma. All the goons in the city are scared of him. No goon in the city would dare to take your gold. I am sure it is done by someone new. You are right. Someone has challenged me on purpose. We won't be able to make a stand in this business without defeating Gajjan. We will have to stop the city from fearing him. So then? - What do we do now? - Don't do anything. He has tasted blood. He shall attack again. We will attack, Mr. Cheema. But not in the middle of the night. During broad daylight, while looking straight into his eyes.. ..by entering his own domain. We need ration! There is nothing at home! What's this commotion about? Don't you understand? There is no oil or rice here. Go away! Come back next month. Go away! Get out away from here. - Come on. - Move it! We don't have anything at home. The kids are hunger, just give me a handful. Go away, old man. Do we need to tell you separately? You won't get anything! Get lost from here! Don't worry, everyone will get grains. So now you'll steal our grains and distribute them? It's not difficult for the one who can steal your gold.. ..to steal your grains as well. Okay! So it was you! Good that you showed yourself. Billa, tear him part. What's wrong? Why did you stop the car? They are blocking the way, ma'am. Gamma, no son. I'll beg you. I'm at your feet here. Don't hit him. Isn't he Gajjan, the goon everyone feared? When a goon crosses his limits, he ends up giving rise to his competitor. Jaggar, stop your son. He will kill me. Stop him, brother. I have been listening to my father's walking stick noise since childhood. Henceforth you will listen to your son's walking stick noise. - Father! - Billa.. Henceforth, anyone who supports Gajjan will be my enemy. - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Gamma! - Long live! - Search the place, Lakha! - Yes, sir. Oh no! What's wrong? - Mother! - Yes? I'll tell you. What's the hurry? Gamma isn't here, sir. - Where is Gamma? - He's in prison. Her son has caused havoc across the city and she says he is in prison. In whatever burrow he is hiding in, call him back. If he wants his father alive then he'd visit me at the police station. Take him along. - Mother! - Move. - Careful. - Move back! - Move away. - Leave him. - Uncle! - Move back! Where are you taking my uncle, inspector? Sukhi.. See for yourself Lakha, police station is a place.. ..which can make anyone yield up. Sir, I have already kept the gate open.. ..so that I can reunite the father with the son. Wait.. Let me take his testimony first. Here.. Write that you stole from government's godown in broad daylight.. ..and shot at a decent man. Come on. Write it down. Forget about other confession.. ..first make me confess that I slapped you in your own police station. I'll kill you right here. France made, shoots 15 rounds. It will riddle your body with bullets. What do I need to do? Henceforth, you will support us instead of Gajjan. Gajjan? Who is Gajjan, brother? Come on inspector, let's take a round of the city. "I have never tried to suppress the poor." "Even the police station is aware of my status." "I have never tried to suppress the poor." "Even the police station is aware of my status." "I don't spare liars." "I have always demanded what was right." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." "Our enemies fear the path we choose." "Even the obstacles on the path crumble loose." "Our enemies fear the path we choose." "Even the obstacles on the path crumble loose." "We protect the helpless. We punish the culprits." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." Lakha.. Don't let anyone without searching them thoroughly. Okay, sir. Inspector, it's us. Emergency has been declared. We have been ordered to search every vehicle. Now you will implement those orders on us? Inspector! You survive on our crumbs. How dare you! Don't try to act smart.. I'll kill you and throw you into the river. Move. - Hello, sir. - Hello. How are you doing? Search is on? Of course it is. There are a lot of smugglers in this area these days. Make sure to strip-search them. Who knows he might be hiding a gold brick in his knickers. Continue with the search Lakha. Okay guys, start striping. Come on, remove your clothes. What are you staring at? Remove your clothes. Hey.. you too. We didn't find anything, sir. What can you expect to find on these paupers anyway? - Bye, see you. - Bye. Bye. Gamma, you have changed the game by defeating Gajjan. Here's a small gift for you. - A key? - To your car. It is one in a million, just like you. Go and tell everyone who rules the city. That's enough. Sukha.. ..there was a time when we used to walk to our destination. There were million places to visit, the world belonged to us. Today we have such a big car, money in our pockets and world under our feet. But no place to go. A place to go? I'll suggest one, let's go and drink at TC. Sukha, we are at the TC, but I still haven't found any peace. When I used to pass through your city's lanes.. ..they used to say, look a smuggler is passing by. Jaggar Blackia's son is passing by. Now when I have actually doing illicit deals... Now when I am actually black marketing.. I rule the city, everyone salutes to me. Ask them now, do they have the courage to say it? Do you know why? The one on whose neck you keep your knee on, treats you as his father. Today I ask them! Do you have the courage to say it to my face.. "Gamma, you are Blackia, a black marketer, a smuggler!" Today I say I am Blackia. Yes, I am Blackia! Gamma! This money, this strength and fame.. ..is of no use. Because my mother survives on her hard earned money. She won't get inside the car Cheema gave me. But yes, there is someone.. ..who likes to sit in big cars. Who is it! Who are you, sir? Gamma? Son, you? Come on Lala ji, addressing a smuggler's son with respect? Where is your daughter whom you have brought up affectionately? The one who never steps out without a car? Sheetal.. Sheetal! - Hey Sheetal! Sheetal! - Don't ruin my reputation, son. Neighbours are watching. I'll be ruined. Don't worry Lala ji, I won't ruin your reputation. I am not like you. Sheetal! Sheetal! There comes my love, my sweetheart. So wanted me to in a big car you will come running towards me to hug me? Look, it's here. Come on now, what are you waiting for? Sukha? I know she won't hug me. You love.. this. I loved from in here! Lala ji will find many for you with big cars.. ..but you won't find anyone who loves you from the bottom of his heart.. ..the one who will ruin his life for you. Your father used to say.. ..that forget sitting in the car.. ..I don't even have the status of standing next to one. You want to know my status now? "Your rings tell me.." "I'll be left all alone." "Oh sweetheart, I'll be left all alone." "Oh fool, I'll be left all alone." These elections are a great opportunity to build you strength and power. People are fed up of the government because of the Emergency. The opposition will win for sure this time. Opposition leader has sent you a special invitation. You should assume that future government's minister has invited you. I don't bow before anyone expect Him. If he wants to meet me then he should come over. There you go, Mr. Maggar Singh. My job was to introduce you two, and I have done it. Now you can discuss the rest with him. You became quite famous in no time. You have started making headlines. You are making headlines too. You stay in business because of your good reputation.. ..and stay in business because of my bad reputation. We might be doing different kind of work.. ..but none of us can survive without each other. This time's election is no less than a war. And one requires warriors during a war. You don't put a value on warriors, Mr. Maggar Singh. Money, men, weapons, whatever you want, we'll provide. I had come to buy you out but you've made me sell myself. Okay then, I'll get going. Mr. Maggar Singh! Goodbye. Goodbye. Now we won't work like outlaws. We will get inside the system and do our work. "Even the best ones bowed down before us." "Even leaders seek our support." "Even the best ones bowed down before us." "Even leaders seek our support." "It is not so easy to get famous here." "But I am earned my popularity." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." "We aren't the one with black hearts.." "..though the world addresses us as, Blackia-smugglers." What's making the headlines these days? Opponent MLA has accused Maggar Singh.. ..of winning the election with the help of Gamma Blackia. What times have come! These days leaders cannot survive without goons. Naseeb Kaur! Stop working so hard. Your son has become a famous man now. He has contacts in the government too. Look at this, his picture made it to the newspaper. Look at this, there was a time when patriots' pictures.. ..used to make it to the headlines.. ..and now they publish pictures of goons. - Where did these boxes come from? - Across the border. From across the border? You don't need to worry, Gamma. This belongs to us. But why do we need these weapons, Mr. Cheema? We have the system in our pockets. We don't have any enemies left either. These weapons are not for the enemies, Gamma. - They are for us. - Baba ji? Yes, Baba ji. After spending all these years in prison I've learnt.. ..you won't get your rights if you just ask for it. We will have to fight for our religion and our place. Who will you fight, Baba ji? Your own people? You don't need weapons to fight with your own people. Don't worry, these weapons will only point towards tormentors.. ..and not helpless people. Look Gamma, we started this business for our own benefit. But we have some duty towards our religion as well. What's the harm if we bring in a box full of weapons.. ..along with four boxes filled with gold? Anyway, police has set up multiple check posts. You should drop Baba ji to his place. 'A few days ago in Amritsar a riot took place..' The situation is getting worse by the day. The situation here is bad as well. The new DSP is very strict. I'm trying to get him transferred. We need to stay low for some time. They just upgraded them from shorts to full pants. But the cops wearing them are still the same. 'Curfew has been declared after reports of violence in a few parts of Punjab.' Hello? Yes? Please wait. Brother, Sukha's on the line. 'Prime Minister while addressing' 'the parliament said that the violence in Punjab' 'External sources are responsible for them.' Yes, Sukha? What? Shindi? Brother! What happened? Sukha, what is wrong with him? Son, he overdosed on brown sugar (heroin). - Brown sugar? - Yes. It's an expensive drug. It might be called sugar, but it is nothing less than poison. I am surprised how did an ordinary person like him.. ..get hold of such an expensive drug? Doctor, don't worry about the money. Order any medicine from anywhere but nothing should happen to him. Okay, don't worry, I'll try my best. Okay? Okay. I'm committed a sin. You should shoot me. Stop talking nonsense.. tell me what happened. All this happened because of me. Sukha, you need to do something. You need to go to Delhi. I should go to Delhi? All alone? I never went to Delhi even in my dreams. Why don't you send Gamma instead? Gamma has gone way past these small jobs. Don't you want to do anything on your own? Do you wish to always hold Gamma's hand? Gulzar.. What's this? This is what you need to take to Delhi. But what is it? Keep it below your tongue.. And you will know. How is it? When do I leave? How are you, brother? Why do you look troubled? The cycle we gave is not working properly? You want to taunt that you gave me the cycle, don't you? Come on, let's have some fun. Take this. This is dry alcohol which the rich use. It's hard to find in Delhi and Bombay. - What! - Put it under your tongue. How is it? It's is better than wine. Here, have some more. You don't need a glass or any water. Sister won't have a reason to fight with you. It's simple and dry. I think he took too many pills unknowingly. Please forgive me, brother. - Careful. - You move back. What are you doing here? Mother.. Please forgive me. Mistakes can be pardoned, not sins. You ruined your own sister's life, you fool. I wonder how many more families will mourn because of you. It would have been better if you had died instead. Go away. Get lost from here. Leave! Mother.. Calm down, my child. What happened? Police encounter. They took five policemen with them. I wonder how did these small kids get hold of such dangerous weapons. 'What's the harm if we bring in a box full of weapons..' '..along with four boxes filled with gold?' He is busy. You know no one can enter his personal room. Gamma? What are you doing here at this hour? - Come in, why did you stop? - Who are you? I am your close friend Iqbal Cheema. No. You cannot be anyone's friend. Your friendship is fake just like your name is. Tell me the truth, who are you? You know how many innocent people have lost.. ..their lives because of drugs and weapons you brought here? We were making a lot of money by smuggling gold. Did you do all this for money? No, no, no. I didn't do anything. It was all your doing, Gamma. You deceitfully made me commit this sin by hiding your identity. You are a traitor. You betrayed your friend and your country. A traitor? If there is a traitor in this room, it's you. I am patriotic soldier of my country. You wanted to know my identity, right? So there you. My name is Iqbal Mohammad Khan Cheema. Brigadier, Pakistan army. This isn't a war of any rebels.. ..this is a war between two countries. You divided our country into two parts during the 1971 war.. ..and humiliated us in front of the world. That was the day we had decided.. ..that we would amputate your strongest arm, Punjab. Because you Punjabis stand at the border like walls. Only to martyr unnecessarily and issue hollow threats? Hey! We don't fight for medals. Punjabis die for their pride and honour. We are from the religion the greedless father of which.. ..sacrificed his entire family for the country. What did this country give you? Join us. We will help you get your rights and freedom. You will give us our rights? You couldn't win a single war. He says he will help us get our rights. If you call this a war.. ..then you will lose this war as well. This time you will lose, we won't. Because this time we will use not bullets but drugs to kill you. You will see that the seed of poison which I have sown in Punjab.. ..will ruin Punjab and make it hallow in a few years. I'll kill you before that ever happens. You can kill me only if you get out of here alive. Gulzar! Stay back! Shoot and both you and your pet dog will die along with me. Stop. Keep them down. Keep them down! [Islamic prayer] He shouldn't escape. Call the minister. Ask him to put all the cops in the district behind him. But I thought he was a nice man. That's why is sought his help. Sikhs will never support drug dealers. Now we will teach him a lesson together. Gamma, this is DSP Shamsher Singh. Baba ji, police has surrounded us. I am the one who made him so powerful. Now my own hands cannot reach them. I don't know what to do. Otherwise, we will be forced to come inside. "And when the time comes.." "..I should die fighting heroically on the field of battle." Surround the place! Go! - You go this way! - Let's go. Surround the place. We will handle the police. You just make sure that that cheat doesn't escape. Blessed are those... who take the name of Lord. This is big battle, give me the strength to fight. Who take the name of Lord. Stop. Where to, Gamma? Where to, Gamma? Let's settle our score first. Look, ours fight is personal. Let's do this some other time. That Pakistani has brought drugs into the country. Punjab will get ruined if we don't stop him. After making my son a handicap.. ..you are suddenly think about the betterment of Punjab's youth. We are grateful to Mr. Cheema. With his help now, we'll run the drugs and weapons' business here. Today, Mr. Cheema will go to Pakistani and you'll go to hell. Billa! Billa! Billa! [Islamic prayer] No one will shoot! Otherwise, BSF will show up. You don't deserve an easy death anyway. You should be sent back in such a state.. ..that your country learns what Punjabis will do to.. ..all those who will cross the border will ill intentions. Chop him into pieces without making any noise. Get up! Do you think that you've ended it all? I have created such a network in your system.. ..that in future you Punjabis will be found dead.. ..at the border, ruins and street due to drugs. You can never back away from this path. Come on, surround the entire village. Gamma! What's wrong, son? What is wrong with you? Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. - Gamma! - No! Look at this, today he is paying for your crimes. Stay away today. Let him be my son at least today. You shouldn't be so stubborn, son. Mothers have an habit of scolding. Don't be so stubborn, son. Don't be so stubborn. When I was small, you used to punish me, whenever I made a mistake. I used to feel that all my crimes have been pardoned. I have committed a grave sin, mother. Give me salvation. Otherwise, my soul will wander. Give me salvation, mother. No, son. Kill me. I have kept you in my womb for nine months. How can I let you die? How can you ask someone who gave you birth to kill you? How can I a mother kill her son? It is not possible. - Mother... - No, son. 'Shoot Gamma as soon as you spot him.' 'He shouldn't manage to escape today.' 'After getting beaten up by you I feel like I've atoned myself.' 'A strayed youth not only leads one life..' '..but the entire religion on the path of ruination.' 'The network enemy country made using strayed youth, corrupt officers..' '..leaders who are traitors to use against us still active.' 'This network is responsible for pushing the youth into the evil path of drugs.' 'This is a war Punjab is fighting now, and we need to win it at any cost.'
