Lord, I've made my share of mistakes But I meant no wrong And when the sun sets On the hillside The nights can be so long Bedrooms are all empty My pillow's gone cold to the bone Guess it's really never too late To find a new home It took a long time to find her And even longer to let her go And the good days were the best days I've ever known The hard times could be rocky But they were better Than being alone Never too late To find a new home It's 10:30, Mike. You're late. For what? Okay. All right. Back when we had winners, I was afraid to lose you to the competition. Five times you won the All-American Futurity and every goddamn time I thought, "Oh, I won't be able to keep Mike. Somebody's gonna grab him." But that was a long time ago, wasn't it? Yeah. That was before the accident. Before the pills. Before the booze. You look out there in that barn now, a string of second-rate horses. Kind of like my trainer, isn't it? I'm not afraid of losing you to anybody now. You're a loss to no one. It's time for new blood. Yeah, I can see that. And you know what you're late for? What? Clearing out your locker. Why don't you do that on the way out? You gonna say anything? No. I was just gonna say, "Howard, I've always thought of you as a small, weak, and gutless man." But, you know, there's no reason to be rude. So, you don't lock your doors? Ain't got nothing worth stealing. What's up? You're just killing time in here or what? You look awful. Well, you've looked horrible longer, so I guess you win. Yeah. What do you want? You remember I had a son? Rafael. Yeah. That's him, like, at five or six. Well, he's 13 now, and I wanna get him out of Mexico. I wanna get him up here. I wanna do the right thing. I want him to live with me. What does his mother think about that? Yeah, well, Leta, - she's a nutcase. - Oh. I mean, she was fun at a party, but... and she gave me him. Yeah. But he's in trouble. Mike, the kid's in trouble. And I gotta get him out of there. Yeah. Why don't you call the authorities, then? I can't go to the authorities. I have legal issues. I can't go back into Mexico. He's being abused. How do you know that? Well, I don't know it directly from him, if that's what you're asking me, but I know that. I know it from people around her, and she's a mess. And she's letting the kid be abused. Uh... Well, I don't know what you want from me 'cause, you know... You want me to go down there and kidnap him? Bring him out of there? It's not kidnapping if he's your kid. It isn't my kid, so I don't think he'll go with me in the first place. Yes, he would. He'll listen to you, Mike. I know he will. He'll know the minute he sees you, you're a real cowboy. He'll listen to you. Tell him about the house. Tell him he's gonna have the run of the whole ranch. He's gonna have his own horse. Tell him that. It's every boy's dream. Well, I think you got dozens of guys here who could do it and I'm not really the kind... You know what? You owe me, Mike. I was standing here, looking at all this, thinking about making the payments on this place for you. About helping you not lose it after you... After you lost her and the boy... You know how many people told me to stop doing that? To just cut you loose. I said, "No. You know what? I owe Mike that much." But I think you owe me a little bit, and you gave me your word. And that used to mean something, Mike. Yeah. I owe ya. All right. There's cash in this envelope. Quite a bit of cash for travel and expenses. I've got her address on here and this is a map of the area in Mexico City she's living in. That's Rafo, like I said, about six. He's 13 nearly now, and he's gonna be taller. - Thank you. - Okay. Buenos dias, girls. - Hello. - Hi. So, where are you headed? Playa. We're gonna hit the beach. Which beach? I mean, there are many beautiful beaches in Mexico. However many we can in a week. I bet you will. Enjoy your stay in Mexico, girls. - Thank you. - Thank you. What's your purpose for entering Mexico? Uh, a holiday. Can I see your paperwork? I'm actually with them. Just you? Just me. Enjoy your stay in Mexico. Thank you. Why the hell would a kid ever wanna leave this place? Hey, be respectful, old man. Take off your hat. Usually when a woman laughs like that, a man's fly is open. That's the only thing that's not on the table. You're good. Aw. Oh, no. Is this your family, Michael Milo? Yeah. From a long time ago. Hmm. You also have a picture of my son from a long time ago. I can explain that. No, you needn't. You think you're the first my ex-husband sent? The first one is in jail. Beastly man with no manners. The second was more amiable. Couldn't find Rafo and left. Tell me, cowboy, why does his father really want him now? He has no real love for the boy. Well, maybe he's trying to change all that. You're picturing some innocent kid. Like in that photo. A nice, respectful boy who wears clean clothes to school, and sings in church. I guarantee you that isn't the case. My son is wild. An animal who lives in the gutter. Gambling, stealing, cockfighting, at the... at the calle Choca. Take him. Take him if you can find him. He's a monster. You have made a long trip for nothing. I don't know where my son is now. He's like his father. He runs away. He hates his father. He hates me. So, go home, Mr. Mike. Go home. When did you give up? No matter what people say, some aren't cut out to be parents. Have a drink with me, hmm? No, I got a job to do. Well, then, good luck. You'll need it. Nice. Get away. Hey, Rafo. Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Hey, Rafo, you can come out now. The cops are gone. Where the hell are you? You can come out now. I'm a friend of the family. Okay. Come on. Come here. Hey, hey, come on. Chicken... Bad chicken. No, no! Hey, hey! Ah. All right, you little bastard. Come on out. I'm gonna count to five. I'm gonna wring this chicken's neck. You got that? One. Two. Three. Four. - Give me my rooster! - Five. Not until we talk, Rafo. You know my name? How did you find me? I found you because your mother told me where you were. That's why. If she sold me to you, you're a fool. Touch me and I'll kick your ass, old man. What the hell you talking about? You are some perverted friend of my mother from one of her parties. Perverted old man. Hey. You're talking to the wrong person. I'm here representing your dad who wants to see you. Howard Polk. I work for him, that's all. You are a cowboy? A ranch hand? Yeah. That's right. I've done a little of that. Okay, talk. Not here. Not here. You're joking, yes? No, not joking. My father, he wants me. Well, you're his only kid. And he sent you for me? Yep. You're a liar. My father hasn't seen me for years. Why does he want to see me now? Well, he wants to see you, that's all. He, uh... He misses you. You're full of shit. My father doesn't want me. He never even called on my birthdays. Look at that. It's me when I was little. Yeah, that's it. Same guy. He gave you that? He did. If my father wants me back, why didn't he telephone? He sent you, some apestoso viejo. I don't know what that means, but I don't like it. When I was little, my father said he would give me a special horse. He never did. He's a liar. Eh, just a little late, that's all. That doesn't mean he's a liar. But he's gonna make it up to you now. He's got a big ranch. He's got horses, cattle. In fact, he's got hundreds of horses. You'll be able to ride yourself silly. - Hundreds of horses? - Yeah. Even owns a rodeo up there. Rodeo? Hundreds of horses... He's a big boss! Yeah, he's a big boss. That's what I'm telling you. Maybe I'll go. - Just for a while. - Yeah. Good. Good, I think so. If I don't like it, I will say, "To hell with him," and come back. Yeah, that's right. If you don't like it, to hell with it. Okay. Deal. I can bring my rooster? Yeah. I don't see why not. Hey, Macho, come. Where ya going? I have to get my things. No, stay here. Shit. What can I say? I can't believe it. Where did you find him? Right where you said. At the cock fights. And where is he? He said he was gonna go out and get his stuff. You poor fool. Yeah. - Ah. - Well... This time... This time you'll have a drink with me. Ah... you really thought Rafo would go with you, hmm? Mm, maybe he will. Here. Cheers. Hmm. Come. Let's celebrate. Hmm. Tell me something... What are we celebrating? Anything. I'm up for anything. Corazon. Uh... I, uh... I don't know. I think I better get the hell out of here. Otherwise, this job ain't gonna be finished. You dare... You dare insult me in my own home? No, I didn't mean to insult you. I just... Okay. Hey. You think I'm a whore? Is that what you think? Hey, I'm talking to you. Don't go! One more step and you're finished. I'll call the Federates right now. Give them your name, and you'll be arrested for kidnapping. And spend the rest of your life in a Mexican prison. How do you like that? You don't like that, do you? Rafo is mine. He's mine and he stays. You understand? He's my property, and nobody takes my property. His father ran away from us. He had his chance, but he left us here. He left him with me. You have exactly five minutes to get in your vehicle and leave Mexico City. Do we understand each other? Get out. Get out now. - Lucas. - Take him out. Okay. The hell? Hello, gringo. I guess I fell asleep, yes? Get out. What? Get out. - Get out. - What? Get out, I said. What? What the... I said, out. Get out, you're not going. - Say who? - Says me. Says your mother. - I'm going with you. - No, you're not going with me. I said I am going. You're staying. If you go without me, do you know what I'll do? - What'll you do? - I'll go to the police. - Yeah? - Not here. In the next town where they don't know me. I'll go to the Federates and I'll tell them I was raped by a dirty gringo in a truck from Texas. You're sick. What are you gonna do when they get you to the hospital and the doc wants to shove his hand up your ass to give you an examination? Not so good, huh, sonny? Get your ass out of here. Jesus! Hit the highway. Then, I'll walk like a cripple. Like this... And I'll say your truck, you hit me and run away. Jesus Christ. I'll tell them that this thing is not yours. It's stolen. Jesus! You're sick as a dog. Get out of here. You ain't... Jerk off. All right, where's the wallet? Where's what? My wallet. Give it here. We go and I tell you, okay? Look, the only place you're gonna go is the hospital. Now give me the goddamn wallet. Ah. You get too angry. It's not good for you at your age. Give me the wallet now! Eat shit. What are you talking about, "eat shit"? Yeah. Yeah. You're pretty quick for old man. "Eat shit." Yeah. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. What deal? I give your wallet, you take me to the border. Only to the border. Then I get across by myself. No deal. No dice. I want to go with my father. All right. Get in the back. I want you to take this chicken, tie his leg back down there so it doesn't... I don't want him crapping on the upholstery here. No. What do you mean, "no"? No, and he's not a chicken. His name is Macho. I don't care if his name is Colonel Sanders. Just get his ass back there. He's Macho. You know what it means, "macho"? It means "strong." Come on, Macho. Yeah. Shit. It's bad to have a fighter, a champion, with his leg tied all day. Gringo, you look a smart man to me. So... I'll make a deal with you. Yeah? What kind of a deal? If Macho sits with us, when he fights, I'll give you half of the money. The day Macho sits up here is the day I barbecue his ass. It's not good for his spirit. Well, I'm really worried about that. But he's strong now. When I first find him, he'd lose every fight. He was on the ground. His leg broke. So, I took care of him, and I said, "Stand up, you bastard. Fight!" He killed a very big rooster. From that time, he's Macho. A champion. That's the most exciting thing I've ever heard. Why don't we sleep in the truck? Yeah. 'Cause we can sleep out here in the wide-open spaces. The air is nice and clean. It's not like it is in the cities. It's beautiful. I think something else maybe. What? Like when I fall asleep, you'll drive away without me. Yeah. I'm not gonna run away without you, Kid. Just go to sleep. What's the matter with this guy? He's got something on his eye here. Got something in right here. Wait, wait a second. - Oh. - Yeah. I got it. Very good. Go ahead. You're a veterinario? No. No, veterinario. I've just loved animals all my life. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. At rodeo? Yeah, rodeo. Working on ranches and working with horses and stuff especially. Well, so I think he'll be fine. Macho. His name is Macho. Whatever. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Guy wants to name his cock "Macho," it's okay by me. He's macho, like me. Very strong rooster. Everyone wants him. One even stole him from me. Yeah, your mother says you've stolen a few things yourself. Cars and such. When we get up in the States, you touch a man's vehicle, that doesn't go over. Yeah. I'll remember when we get to Texas. Especially in Texas. And you can watch all that "macho" crap up there too. Nobody likes that stuff. How'd you get the bruises? Being on the street cause all that? Sometimes. And sometimes when I go home, it's worse. That's why I stay on the streets. All the bad stuff happens at home. My mom hates me. You want to know why? Not really. She bring home a strange man today, another strange man tomorrow, and she said I should call them "Uncle." And I say to her, "How many men can I call 'Uncle'?" So, she hates me. And Aurelio, he was in prison. Sometimes he sells drugs and brings her pills and dope. One time I spit on him. He hits me to teach me manners and I said to him... "Don't teach me manners when you're in bed with my mom, where she sleep." So, I say, to hell with that. I make a few pesos with Macho for myself and I do what I want. On the street, I trust no one. But it's safer than at home. You can never trust no one. We're gonna take a little bit of a different route here. - Federates are there. - Oh, shit. We gotta go down this road. What do they want? Well, they probably wanted you. We'll stay away from them. What are we doing? We go off, take this road here. All the way around, and we won't have to deal with them. No good. It's bump, bump, bump. Bit more like jail, jail, jail. Hi. We brought our own red rooster with us, see? In your honor. Gracias. Uh, I'm gonna have a cerveza blanca and he'll have a... What's Amarillo? Uh, nothing. Just something I drink. Oh, okay. Gracias. It's tequila. - Tequila. - Yeah. You're not gonna drink any tequila. But I want it. I don't care. You're not gonna drink it, not with me. I drink tequila once and I never got sick. Yeah, well, when you're with your dad, up above the border, you can drink battery acid, but you're not gonna drink tequila with me. An Orange Crush, por favor. Yeah, that's better. I'll be back. Where are you going? Make a little call. Yeah, hello. I found the boy. Yes! Shit, that's great! That's great! It wasn't easy, but I found him and we're on our way. Not without bumps, but we're on our way. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I knew you'd find him. I knew I did the right thing sending you. Not like those other two guys you sent down here. Thanks a lot for that. I'm gonna be calling you along the way and you'll be playing it straight with me, understand? Okay. All right. Just get him back up here, okay? - You've got it. - All right. Kinda glowing there, kid. Ah. Fine Mexican beer. Can I wear your hat? No. Why not? Because it's a cowboy hat. And you're not a cowboy. Anything a gringo cowboy can do with horses, a Mexicano can do better. Well, you're in bad shape, then, because you're half gringo. What do you think, kid? You think I'm a gringo? Yeah. Do you think I'm like my father? A coward? Who run away? - Well... - You think I'm like my mom? Weak? I don't know. I don't know your mom. - But your father... - Then... who am I, Mike? Here, kid. Try the hat... I don't want to wear your dumb, stupid hat. Mike! Help me, Mike! Get off! What the hell are you doing? - You leave him alone. - Get away. He's not your son. He's not yours to take. His mother warned you, gringo. Don't be stubborn! - No. - This is your last chance. - Mike! - The kid is not your concern. - Good job, Macho. - Hey, stupid bird! Good job, Macho. Okay. Hey! What's he saying? It's not good. Rafael. Rafael. Time for us to go. You did all right, kid. You did all right. You want another tortilla? No, I don't. I don't think so. No. What's the matter? Yeah, no, I don't feel too good. I don't know why you're laughing. You Mexicans always laugh at us gringos because we get sick on your dirty water. It's not the water that's dirty. It's you. We drink and we're healthy. You drink it and die in the toilet. Ah, don't mention that. Speaking... Run! It's gonna come out. Wait. I'll give you something to make you feel better. What? Here, try it. Cactus? Yeah, it's good. Try it. You try it. Okay. Watch. - See? I did not die. - Okay. Hey! - Go! Go, go, go! - No! The car! No! No! Stop! Shit! I can't even call the cops. So, what now? We gotta get ourselves some transportation. And clothes. And you should dress not like an American. So everybody doesn't see gringo, gringo, gringo. I want some water. There's a store right here. I think I'll go check it out. Yeah. Look, Macho. A gringo goes in, and a Mexicano comes out. Yeah, I bought you some clothes. Thank you. Well, I guess we should be going. What's this? Transportation. Transportation? Where'd you get it? I find it. Bullshit. It was sitting right here. So nobody want it, I guess. Yeah? Nobody was sitting in it then, huh? We'll leave it in the next town. - Yeah. - I only lend it from somebody. In Mexico, we're friendly people. You lend, I lend. - We lend, everybody lends. - Yeah, yeah. What? Just, uh... It's not your car and I'll be driving it. Macho. You're kind of growing on me, kid. This looks like an interesting town. Maybe we should check it out. Hola, Mama. What do you say we look around, huh? Bring in the rooster. Federates. I'll have coffee for me, and anything in the house for him. Aqui. Thank you. Uh... She says that's strange. The Federates never come over here. Gracias. Thank you very much. Yeah. Si. Uh... I'm gonna take a little siesta here. Tired, eh? Old man needs a nap? You bet. Macho. The hell you doing here? Don't drink out of my cup either, will you, pal? Dreamt I was in a desert bar, but now I'm in one. Jerk. She says you don't snore. She likes that. Oh. Well... Did I miss anything here? Yeah. She asked why the Federates were looking for us. I tell her you're my father, and you broke out of the loco, the crazy hospital. And they're looking for you. And she bought into all that? She didn't believe me. So, then I told her you're here to bring me to Texas with my father and my mother says no. So, you told her the truth. I thought you didn't trust anyone. No. But you trust her? Yeah. Yeah, for some reason, I guess, yes. Oh, well, on that, I think we oughta... We oughta go. Will you, uh, thank the sefiora for me? Senorita. She's not married. She's a widow. Marta. Mi nombre, name, Marta. I'm Mike. Si. He say. Yeah. Okay. Not another roadblock. What's the Spanish word for "irony"? Well, we'll have to go back to that town we were in. Just wait till this shitstorm's over with. Perfect place to get out of the rain. Huh. It's a shrine, Mike. Of the Virgen Maria. Okay. What are you doing? - Hmm? - What are you doing? Oh, I'm, uh... I'm gonna go to sleep. What the hell do you think this is? We cannot sleep in the shrine of the Virgen Maria. Maria's not gonna worry about it. She's fine. She won't care. Night, kid. Mike? Yeah? Mike, do you believe in God? I don't know, kid. I guess so, yeah. You Catholic? No. I'm not Catholic, kid. That's too bad for you, Mike. Even if you believe in God and you're not Catholic, they don't believe in you. What, is he playing favorites, maybe, or something? Yeah. I don't believe this shit. "We're all God's children." Do you? Well, we're all somebody's children, kid. Do you have any children? No. Oh, I did. Did? Yeah. Matthew, boy. My boy... and my wife were killed in an auto accident some years back. Sorry. Anyway... I wasn't much good after that. I kind of went on a rampage. Too much drinking. Being crazy. But your dad, he saved my ass. He gave me work. He... gave me my life back. I owe him a lot. And you're the payback, kid. You're the payback. I'm paying him back. Hey! Look at this. Fantastic, huh? How'd you know we were here? She came to light a candle, and she saw our car. Yeah. Well, thanks. Gracias. Muy bien. Oh, damn! What's the matter? Look, the car. Whoa, Jesus. Well, we better get used to this town, kid. We're gonna be here a while. It's a piece of shit. You all right? Hey. You speak English, amigo? Yeah. These horse are for sale. You want to buy? I noticed one of those guys has got an injury on the left haunch there. He's a little rough to me. Yeah, in fact, all your horses are a little on the rough side. They get hurt being rounded up. Wild horses, huh? Si, we catch, but not break them. They are very wild. Not many can ride. Yeah. Pretty hard to sell a horse that you can't ride. Maybe we can do something about that. - We? Who's we? - Yeah. You and me. I don't even know how to ride. But I can do anything. Of course, you can. Wouldn't want to get up there in Texas and have people find out you don't know how to ride. Whoa. Macho. Okay. Pick up the flow, will ya? Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. More like it. Do less with your hands. Pick it up more. Attaboy. Not bad at all. Pick it up. Pick it up. More. There you go. Don't lay back. Stay upright. There, that's good. That's good. Heels down. That's good. That's a good little figure eight. Come back this way. All right, fella. You're doing good. You're doing great. May not be a disgrace in Texas after all. Here's a gift, ladies. Cafe? Sure. All right. Okay. Thank you. You know, we just brought you that meat as a gift. Yeah, I just came here to bring stuff. I didn't come here to freeload a meal. Uh... Um, she says she'll do as she pleases. Oh, all right. Okay. These your girls? Mm-mm. Granddaughters. Her daughter got sick and died. Also her son-in-law. Her husband died too. Same illness. Two years ago. Now widow, like you. Sorry. No. She's deaf? Seems so. How do you know sign language? Just something you pick up along the way. What did you say? Wouldn't you like to know? Gracias. So, what's that all about? The deputy. What about the deputy? Uh, first, he said he's a sheriff and it's his job to know what's going on. But she said he's not the sheriff. He's a deputy. And that's only because his uncle made him deputy. And they don't even have a police station. And if he didn't mind his business, she said he never eat at the cantina again. Um, he said... Uh, what's next? Looking good, kid. Look where you're going, and go where you're looking. Good. Put your heels down. Okay. Heels down. Yeah, don't look like a sack of potatoes there. Your dad's gonna be a happy man seeing you that way. - We'll see you in a bit. - Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come on. Uh, this is Sefiora Reyes. Her goat was attacked by dogs, so I tell her you're good with animals. Well, why don't you put him over here. Put him on this table, we'll take a look. Put him right up there. Let me see. Let's see. Oh, yeah. Yeah, somebody chewed on him pretty good. Not so good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I think we can fix her up in a bit. And it's gonna be okay. All right y. Mike, it should've taken three, maybe four days tops. Been two goddamn weeks. What are you doing? I told you it was gonna take a little while. I heard that already. Just keep telling him what he wants to hear. - Who? - "Who?" The kid. Rafael. Just keep him happy, and whatever you do, do not let his mother get a hold of him. Or her lawyers will never respond. Respond to what? It's a business thing. A few years ago, down there in Mexico, I invested in some property in her name to avoid their goddamn taxes, and now those investments have matured. So I want the return on my investment. Just like the kid. Well, yeah, okay. So, you get it. Mm-hmm. I get it. You played me, you bastard. I didn't play you. What are you, eight years old, Mike? Jesus! If I have something she wants, maybe she'll negotiate. Christ, I'm a reasonable man. I'm just asking for my half. This kid would be better off without either one of you. Well, you know what? It doesn't make a shit what you think, Mike. I'm his father and I actually want him back. This isn't all about the money, okay? The kid's my son. So, please... Please, can you stick to the plan? Just meet me at the border with him. Yeah. Was that my father? Yeah, it was, kid. Did he say anything about me? Ask how I am? Well, he did, yeah. He... he wants the best for ya. - He does? - Yeah. He still wants me? He still wants me to come? 'Course he does, kid. Why wouldn't he? Hold it, hold it, hold it. Give me that. Okay, come on, baby. Right through there. Stick your head in there, and put it on up here. Put this here. Okay. We got him. Now, that was the easy part. - That was the easy part? - Yeah. Next, they don't like it when you cinch the girth. It's just like this. You just have to pull, cinch it up. You can do it. - You wanna try it? - Okay. Just cinch it up, and put up half of... An eighth of it. Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! He's so wild. Okay, yeah. Take it easy. Hey, hey. Hey. How did you do that? We did it, partner. We did it. Buenos dias. Buenos dias. Sleep well? I did, yeah. I did. Thank you. Uh, Marta says we can stay in the casita behind her house while we are here. No. We can't do that. Can't do that. We've already imposed on her enough. Well... Uh... She said it's her choice. - And she already... - Right. Cleaned it out for us. Plus, she says we can't keep sleeping in the shrine of the Virgen Maria. It's not a hotel. I know. I'm fighting a losing battle. Okay. It's good or it's no? It's no. But what do we do when we leave? We get ourselves another car, that's what we do. Cook? Yeah. Well, you're always cooking all the time. I thought I would do it for you. And cowboys always cook. It's kind of our deal. Okay. You want? Um... Yeah. Amen. Okay. Um... I think she likes you. Just keep your big mouth shut. And I think you like her. - Gracias. - Gracias. More money to come. More mustangs to break. Yeah, you bet. The whole neighborhood's coming down here. They must think I'm Dr. Dolittle or something. - Uh... - The hell is this? These girls need some help with the animals. Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you about this gal. Yeah, what do you say? You just need to lose a little weight, that's all. You take it easy, just a little more water. Little more water and less food. He wants to know who are you, what's your business? Do you have a, uh, licencia? Well, these people want me to take care of some of their animals. People seem to think I have a knack with that. He said, help the dog, or his wife will be very angry. Yeah? He said it's not good when she's angry. She'll be angry? - Not for you either. - Hmm. Okay. All right. Yeah. Looks pretty good. I don't know how to cure "old." I don't know. But no way am I telling her that. Hmm. Well... I think the dog just needs a lot of rest. Maybe he should sleep with you tonight. On the end of the bed. How's that? Gracias. Yeah. We'll do the best we can. Gracias. I got you. Okay. Just give it a smash. Okay. I'm catching on to this stuff. Si. This right here. Thanks. Yep. Oh. There, I think we got it. Think we got it. Italian lager. If my father didn't want me to come to Texas, I would stay here. Yeah. You could've stayed too. It's good. Mm-hmm. The best place I've stayed in my life. Maybe even better than Texas. Hmm. Could be, kid. But, I want to be with my father. Have a new life in America. But, what if it's no good? What if my father change his mind when he meets me? Doesn't want me? He wants you, kid. He wants you. Rafo! The hell you doing? Nothing. We gotta get out of here. Come on. What? Aurelio. I saw him in town, he's talking to the cops. We gotta get on the road. Uh... But what about the girls? What about Marta? Us being around here is the worst thing that could happen to the girls. We gotta get moving. Come on. Get your ass in gear. Hola, Mike. Marta, we... we have to go. We've got a job we've gotta finish, and just... Well, you've been so great to us, you know, it's just tough to leave. That, and the kids and everything, it's just... Anyway... we've gotta go. Thanks for everything. Let's try this thing. Okay. You go here. Okay, go ahead. What do I say when they ask for my papers at the border? What do I tell them? You don't have to tell 'em anything. Your dad will be there. He'll take care of it all. Okay. Yeah. We gotta lose these guys. When I get to the next set of curves, just hang on, we'll get rid of 'em. We lost them. Yeah, for the time being, anyway. Look, kid, there's something I didn't tell you the other day when we talked. It's about your dad. Yeah, I mean, he wants you to come be with him and everything, but there's another reason. And that's 'cause your mother and he have some investments together. And he thinks if you're with him up in Texas, that she'll give him half of all the investments. So, you lied? No, I didn't lie. I just didn't know at the time, that's all. Bullshit. Hundreds of horses, cattle, a ranch... It's a rodeo. Yeah, that's all true, kid. That's all true. He has all that. You're gonna love it there. How could he... How could you? No... I should have never trust you. Never trust anyone. I didn't know at the time, that's all. You're a liar. And I hate you. I hate you. And I hope you die in jail. Jesus Christ, kid. Bunch of rubes. What the hell is he looking for, anyway? Drugs. Drugs? You gotta be out of your minds. Jerk offs. Asshole. We don't have any drugs. Jesus Christ. Mickey Mouse prick. Yeah. Nothing. - Yeah. - When did you leave Veracruz? I've never been to Veracruz ever. He said, "Where are the drugs?" But no, we don't have drugs. We don't have any drugs. You guys are wasting your time. You got nothing else to do. Loser cops. You wanna help us put this stuff back in the car? Caballeros, I guess we make a mistake. Yeah. Good. Vamonos. You're free to go. Couldn't be sooner. Jesus Christ. One thing I don't understand. Those bastards. If you have no drugs, why you run? We're not running, asshole. Uh... Yeah, his dad's enfermo in Texas, and we gotta get up there right away. Gracias. Gentlemen. Jesus Christ. Asshole. Losers. Stupid bastards. If they had a brain, they'd be dangerous. Thanks a lot, you pricks. Okay, let's get this stuff in the car. You and I, we gotta talk. I don't want to talk to you. Yeah, well, you're gonna talk to me whether you like it or not. I thought you were my friend. For the first time, I thought I had a friend. You're nothing to me. You just get shit in the car, and shut up. I'm gonna get the seat if you can help me with it a little bit. Hey, quick. Pull this. Your father lied to both of us. And... So, quit bitching, huh? You're both goddamn liars. Okay. Okay. Freedom's just on the other side of this hill, kid. Let's go. Let's go. You used to be tough. Now you're weak. You used to ride bulls, ride horses. You were something. I was something. You used to be strong. Macho. Now you're nothing. Yeah. Well, I used to be a lot of things, but I'm not now. And I'll tell you something. This macho thing is overrated. Works perfect for him, but it's overrated. Just people trying to be macho to show that they've got grit. That's about all they end up with. And you sit there and let a bull step all over you, and you let a horse throw you 50 feet in the air. What an idiot. Only an idiot would be in a profession like that. It's just... It's like anything else in life. You think you got all the answers, then you realize as you get old, that you don't have any of 'em. By the time you figure it out, it's too late. Your dad's a good man. We all have to make choices in life, Kid. You have to make yours. Where do you want to go? I made my choice, Mike. I wanna go. Oh, shit. Let's get you out of here. Hey, Mike. Remember me? Rafo, I don't want to hurt your grandpa, so come with me, okay? Mike. Mike. Stay there, asshole. Okay. So, what do you think about Macho now? I think a lot about him. I think he handled everything just beautifully back there. Yeah, he's amazing. The real deal. Yeah. Huh. Thank you, Mike. You're welcome, kid. You take care of that chicken, huh? He's not a chicken. He's Macho. He's yours now. You're sure? It could be... Saturday night barbecue, you never know. I'll take care of him. And you take care, kid. You take care. You know where we are. If you need us. Thank you. All right, boy. Yeah. I hear you, loud and clear. Huh. All right, kid. Lord, I've made my share of mistakes But I meant no wrong And when the sun sets On the hillside The nights can be so long Bedrooms are all empty My pillow's gone cold to the bone Guess it's really never too late To find a new home Took a long time to find her Even longer to let her go And the good days were the best days I've ever known The hard times could be rocky But they were better Than being alone Guess it's never Never too late To find a new home I look back to the days We were young and strong We fought for our freedom We knew the line between right and wrong And we all stood together Now it feels like I'm standing alone Guess it's never Never too late To find a new home It took a long time to find her And even longer to let her go And the good days were the best days I've ever known And the hard times could be rocky Better it was better than being alone Guess it's never Never too late To find a new home To find a new home
