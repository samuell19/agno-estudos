Are you Goolic? I've been waiting for you. Looks like you've had a long trip. 300 miles. Yeah, we left Texas fast. So fast we killed our horses. Another mile of walking would kill us too. But we've got the loot here, safe and sound. Problem is that Corbett's back there, just behind us. Don't be a fool. We're in Colorado now. And Corbett can't cause trouble here. What do you say? Have the times been good or bad here, Goolic? Bad for outlaws. Especially if they're wanted for murder. They hang them just like they do in Texas. And if you don't believe me, ask Goolic. Who are you? Don't you understand, you idiot? When we thought we had him behind us! He was in front all the while. That's him. That's Jonathan Corbett. Unbuckle your belt. Hello, Corbett. How are you? Fine. Thank you. May I present Mr. Brockston? I've heard a lot about you. Really? Not as much as I've heard about you. Miller, as father of the groom, I would imagine you'd have some advice to offer. Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. Well, this is my secretary, Mr. Lynch. And this is Captain von Schulenberg, who's a genuine Austrian Baron. My bodyguard. Your name is well-known in Texas. In Austria we also know of it. Professional courtesy. You're being complemented. The Baron was the best shot in Europe. 23 duals, 23 widows. My compliments. Thank you. I'm sure you've done better. I think the Baron is anxious to have you demonstrate your skill against his. I stopped playing with guns when I was a boy of ten. As you I surround myself with the best in every deal. Shall we take a walk? Corbett, I've heard that you have political ambitions. Some of my friends want me to run for it. But I don't think, I have much of a chance. You don't value yourself enough. Why, in Texas you're more popular than Davey Crockett. You've cleaned out this whole area of outlaws. It's entirely at your own policing. Also one time you were the Sheriff. Not officially. And then, not for long. My saloon with a gambling table was more profitable. You know what you need? You need someone to buy you a campaign of high-level proportions. You mean someone like you? Excatly. Why? You and only you can help me realize a great project. The building of a railroad from the United States to Mexico through Texas. The only thing I need is a man like you in Senate to support me with the government. My railroad would advance this state up to twenty years in one day. Are you really interested in the progress of this country? Well, let's say I construct this railroad and make millions of dollars. But I do construct it. And only I can. What do you say, Senator? Alright. As long as we understand one another, Brockston. I'm interested in progress. Not your personal profit. Fair enough. Hey, Chet! Well, I'll be. The McCoy brothers. Where've you two been keeping yourselves? Sorry, interfering the festivities. But you should know all of this. We've been to Lonely Corner. Yeah, Baker's little girl, no more than 12 years old, she's been raped and stabbed to death. We found her body a couple of hours ago. Do you know who it was? A Mexican. A young barman called Cuchillo. Cuchillo Sanchez. "Sanchez, the Knife". We followed him for twenty miles. But he was too smart to catch. He's heading South. Probably making steady tracks for that Mexican day labourers camp. We're going after him. The Sheriff will have to organize the posse right now. Miller, what's the sense of us sending out a 30-man posse when we've got one man who can do it all by himself? All honest men would be grateful to the one who brings this murderer to justice. I'll bring you the Mexican for a wedding present. Here. This will make you my honorary deputy. What do I need this for? Wear it. The star can come in handy. And shine brightly on your plans? Yeah. Hasta Manana. Corbett, don't you need information about the Mexican? His name is Cuchillo Sanchez and he'll be headed South. Who is he? Jonathan Corbett. He's a manhunter. He's looking around? Looking over here yet? Not yet. Is Cuchillo here? He, Senor! Maybe I could help you. When someone talks to me I want to see his face. Be careful, Signore. He's quick with a knife, as you can see. Where is he? He's sitting in the barber's chair. Get back, barber. I want the man in the chair. Get up, Cuchillo! You're the barber, aren't you? Then give me a shave. The great, great Corbett with a Greek. Who is he? What have you caught? A big one? Not very. His name is Cuchillo Sanchez. I would have taken him in alive. But he put up a fight. It isn't Cuchillo. This boy just happens to look a lot like him. This is Paco Molinas. Sentenced last month for robbery and murder and made an escape Sentence is paid in full. Amen. But you happened to get the wrong man. Because his clothes were the same. And when I found him, it was my horse he was riding. Well, if things were like that, you can stop looking around for Cuchillo. This one here found him first. Right now, the vultures have turned your Mexican to a heap of bones. Well, I'm going to find a hotel room. I'll be leaving tomorrow. There ain't no hotel anymore. There's nothing left. After the gold played out of here, those that could just pulled out and left everything standing. But as a favour I'll let you have the bunk in the front cell. Of course, for friends there's another arrangement if you like. The best thing about my work is, you soon become acquainted with all kinds of people. Yesterday I had a Mexican who said, "If you know anyone around here who could pass for me, I'll give him a gun and a horse riding." Can you imagine? "Why?" I say. "Because I want to have some fun." And would you believe it? He did. Come here! Sure! If you think we've talked enough. Where did you get this? Who gave you this? Don't... careful with my hand! Who gave you this? The Mexican. The one I told you about before. When? Yesterday, some time around noon. Come on. What difference does it make to you? What was he like? Better mannered than you are. That's for sure. He had a nicer face than you have too! So there! More sympathetic, more gentle. And he's much richer too. So if you told me, he was a very rich Mexican Grandy. And if he hadn't been set on going with the Mormons, he could have stayed all night, too. Then I could convince him to stay with me. What a man... Hey! What a nerve! If I take my hand away from your mouth, will you be quiet? Tell me. Is there a young Mexican with you? Yes. Which wagon is he in? Why? I put him in mine. But, right now he's at the spring getting water with little Sarah. Little Sarah? How old is little Sarah? 13. Why do you ask? Because this boy is wanted for rape and murder of a little girl. Hey, Sarah! Come in the water and play. Adelante! Come! See the little fishes. Come on, Sarah. Come on. The water here is shallow. You can touch the bottom. See? Come on! No. Sarah, please. Come on! Don't make me come. Sarah. Hey listen, we play a game. You be the Mormon girl and I be the wolf. Oh, what a pretty thing you are, Sarah. Come over, Sarah. Let me see. Sarah, come on. So that's it! you want to play? Ok. Stop it. Get up, Cuchillo! I could easily kill you right now. Please, don't. Don't rob me, Signore! I swear, I'm a poor Mexican. By the virgin of Kuala Lumpur. Have mercy. Don't kill me. He wants to rob us. Please, don't let him. Come on! Please say you meant that. You meant it, didn't you? He did mean to rob us, I thought. He was a bandit. Please, say so. Si. He was a bandit. But, worst of all, he was an idiot. Adieus, Chica. And gracias. Adieus! Sarah, what happened? I had to shoot him. He was a bandit. He was going to rob and kill us. Be quiet, Sarah. Just let me look at him. Doesn't seem serious. Cuchillo. Where's Cuchillo? The boy's escaped. At least I got here. Before he hurt your daughter. My daughter? Sarah? Sarah's my fourth wife. Who are you? Just a poor bandit who doesn't bother asking names, Signore. I'm here because my stomach's empty. Clear out! Go on now. Get moving. Si, Signore. But if that man's job is open now maybe I could do it? You don't have to give me much, but please, I need work. We don't have jobs for Mexicans here. No, wait. There's a job if the man wants it. It will take a while for Mike to get patched up. Is there anything you're best? Best in all I do, Signora. Perhaps. We'll see. The man is hungry. Get a plate. Not me. That's an order. Feel like working now? Now I could stop a bull with my two hands. Alright. You show us what you can do. Now, who's got an idea? Well, we've got old Barney who's big and he's sure mean. He's right back there in the old ranch. Aye. We've got old Barney. We've been waiting for you, wrangler. That's old Barney. You said you could stop a bull with your bare hands, didn't you? Come on. Prove it. I showed you. Come in the house with me. You can rest. I'll take you there. Go to hell. Come here. As I order. It must be at my orders, just like the others. What are you doing, Mr.? I'm taking this man with me. He belongs to us. He's wanted by the law. In these mountains we've got no law but the bullets in our guns. I said, I'm taking Cuchillo with me. You've been told he's not going back there. Stop it! Men, put away your guns. I blame my men for what happened. They shouldn't have provoked you, Senior... Corbett. I rather think I owe you an apology. But I don't want you to believe that this place is so backward and so barren that the rules of hospitality have been forgotten. Come to the house. That one, he'll go back with you. Put him in a safe place. He'll be quite alright, I assure you. May you burn. May your own mother mourn your birth and pray that you will die. You'll have some tea? So, I found myself a widow and alone on this isolated ranch. It's very lonely for a woman. Especially because I was educated for finer things. You both may go. These men talk and act just like beasts, you see. It's hard to keep on holding their respect. By the looks of things, you're doing alright. What are they doing? She's got him alone. See? She has a new one, you poor idiot. You should know by now how she does it. I bet she didn't wait a minute as soon as you got out of the room. Shut your mouth! You know why I feel sorry for you poor boys because you're sharing this time with me while they're there alone. Now he's kissing her soft, white neck, while she runs her fingers up his back. Soon, there's nothing she won't give to him. So he reaches out... Shut up! I'll kill you if you don't shut up. The best thing that's happened in this place is our meeting one another. What are you trying to say? Can't you see though, now? It's just beginning. He's quick with a gun. He can take what he wants. And she'll try to keep him here. It is bound to happen. But if he stays he'll be your new boss. He'll be here forever. And he'll get rid of you all, one by one. Well, I'm in it too. You know what he came here for. If I go back there to the gringos they'll make me hang. But, if we all go after him we can stop him. Or else, we'll beat them. And if we do? I tell you, it's in your hands. We wait for him to come out, and then we shoot him first. Give me a gun. We can kill him together. Listen, Amigo! You'd better be right. We'll keep an eye on you. You watch me. You'll see me kill him even before you can shoot. Well... a nice idea? You keep hoping that. Keep hoping. We need a man here. A real man of strength. A man like you. Stay here, Corbett. No. You wouldn't be satisfied with just one man. You enjoy being queen bee too much. I saw you look at that Mexican outside. You saved him only for one reason: So you could kill him yourself. Thanks for the tea. I can stop them. Get back! Next it's you, Mexican, if you don't start shooting. Listen, I'll try to get around behind him. If you can keep him busy in front. Right. Go ahead. Keep him under fire. Adieus Cuchillo. Adieus Americanos! You fool! It's a kid's trick to make you shoot and waste all of your ammunition. You won't fool me this time. Where are you? Come up and show yourself. Here I am. No. No, wait, please. I beg you. I'm afraid. Please don't leave me here alone. Please. Don't leave me here alone. Good water? Tastes good, Cuchillo? It tasted better a minute ago. I've been waiting for you. It's the only water around. For a hundred miles. Next time you steal a horse, make sure there's a canteen. Get down! Take it easy. You stink. If the pistol didn't make you brave, you couldn't do this to me. You talking to me? And if it weren't for those stupid pigs back there, you wouldn't have even a chance to catch me. I would have made you run. You would never get me by yourself! Understand? Never. By yourself, you couldn't catch a limping snail. Go ahead. When I've finished breakfast, I'll get the horse and catch up with you. You must have come out of your mother rotten. Hungry? Well, I guess even animals have to eat. Here. What bothers you about me? I've got nothing against you. It's the law you broke that counts. So that's it. And why does the law count? You mean, you don't know? I do know a law. The one that says most of the words in two parts, the masters and the obeyers. In my country, there was such a law. And no one ever knew who wrote it. But we lived under it. Then, one day we listened to Juarez. And he said we should change it. Everybody should be nice and people should stop hating each other and let the peons go free. We thought it would work for a while. But nothing really changed. So, you started running again. What was the use? Because I always get stopped. You don't see, what cares I've got. Bet you don't know I've got a family. I've got 3 children. No money to feed them. My wife is a saint. She works from morning to night as a maid to a priest. And if I was in your place, I bet I would say, "This man should be free to go." If I was in your place, I'd say the same thing. But I wouldn't be foolish enough to expect another man to believe me. Listen, don't you think, you owe me some gratitude? I helped you at the ranch, remember? So you could run. You needed the extra time to escape. But, if I hadn't you... Besides I'm not able to kill a man unless it's a fair fight. I couldn't do it. But a girl of twelve. Her, you could? Bravo! May you rest in peace, little snake. You saw it? You got a bite. If you want, I can draw it out. This is the only way to get rid of the poison. Otherwise it'll soon get into your veins and kill you. It's that fast. Don't think you have a lot of time. In another minute it could be too late. Well? It still isn't enough, you know. Now it should be burnt to close up the wound. Yes. We really should burn it. Get up! Turn around! No tricks! Not me. I told you I couldn't kill a man in cold blood. Now, maybe you believe it. Go ahead. I'll be dead in a couple of minutes anyway. See? This is what bit you. Here. It's yours. You want it? If you don't kill me right now, it will be the last mistake you ever make. But to kill you is a bigger mistake. If I kill you, they'll just send another man after me who is much smarter much. Anyway, now you'll owe me something. I could have killed you, I didn't. Now we have an account to settle, you and I. The next time, remember. But there won't be a next time. Because you'll never get me. Is it blessed, Padre? Easy, Mr. There's plenty here. Don't gulp it. Thank you. You look like someone who took the wrong turn by mistake. What the world happened? How long have you been out here? Four, five days. I don't know. Take it easy. You've got to rest. I'm after a man, an outlaw. You've got to give me a horse and a gun. You're pulling my leg. He's headed towards Mexico and I've got to catch him before he reaches the border. I haven't any money on me. But any Sheriff in Texas will vouch for me and pay you. My name's Corbett. Jonathan Corbett. Alright, Corbett. I'll try to be of some help to you. You can climb on my wagon and get some rest. We are going to California. But, as soon as we get to the first town... I'm losing time. I need a horse now. A horse? You expect me to part with one year Loca, here? Let him escape. Someone else will catch him. If he gets in to Mexico... Don't you understand? He's free. No. I don't understand. I'm sorry. Leave... Leave him alone! You should make some kind of sound, coming through the door. One more minute, if want the future. Do you see that knife? Yes, of course. Here. But I asked him to please don't show it to brothers me. He doesn't like to peel out like this. Who gave it to you? A Mexican boy. Where is he? He is not here now. He departed yesterday. He is gone to Mexico. We live right by the boy. You mean he crossed it? Yes and you must be lines of hundred over. Because you say it is? You don't have the right to cross that line. Cuchilo belongs to the law of my country. I'm not talking about the law. When you cross over that line, you'll be as bas as here's. I becomes a personal matter and you know it. It's my job to bring him in. That pistol being hanging to your belt along why lies it? In time, its weight always changes, man. What do you know about men who carry gun? Do you mind give it to me for a minute? These days, they see much lighter. Did you see that? It is an old habit. And yet it had been 30 years. When I first came here, the brothers promptly named me brother Smith the Western. That mine the whole time. I was running. Anybody who can shoot like you doesn't have to run? I hated the mad man that I had become inside. You must uprunning. You can't keep thinking what would happen to you. Do you understand? Yes, I'm sure you do. But you don't care. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry also. But you! Murdered a child? Yes. A little girl. How old was this girl? Twelve. Was she good looking? Was it your sister? Was it your cousin? I never saw her. I don't understand. Why are you following after this Cuchillo? You must be a Sheriff. No. I don't get you. Captain, in my country, even a private citizen who believes in justice can help out the law. But now you come to Mexico. That's right. Now I'm asking you to help me find this man. I'm not sure I should. You can't even prove to me who you are. Look, you must have heard of this Cuchillo. I know he lives in your town. He said his wife worked for the Padre. That's a big laugh. The Padre never let her enter a church. Rosita's worked in a bordello since she was 15. Yes. I know Cuchillo. I know that one well. He's one of those pieces of trash who stood with Juarez. Then you're looking for him too? Maybe I am. But, I'm not doing it for you. In that case, I'll find him myself. Goodbye, Captain. You know, Signore, there are people I hate even worse than followers of Juarez. I despise all Americanos. So you go ahead. Have fun. It makes no difference to me who kills who. But, be careful. You do anything in this town to cause me trouble and I'll cause you more. So, watch out! I'm looking for the wife of Cuchillo. Her name is Rosita. Are you Rosita? Twenty. You pay it now. Are you the wife of Cuchillo? Don't talk to me about being the wife of that pig. How long has it been since he was here? 3 months he doesn't think about me. And he showed up here yesterday. Promised to stay here with me, then stole all I had. Took my Madonna from me. Where's he gone now? How do I know? He's probably out drunk, giving another woman what I earned. But I pray he'll come back. And then I scratch his eyes out that good-for-nothing pig Alright, calm down! When I find him, there won't be a next time. Why do you say that? He won't bother you anymore because he'll be hung for murder. Hang my man? Yes. You... you want to hang my man? I'll kill you. Filthy scum! You're defending him? A rapist. A murderer. Don't you understand? Help! Help! Stop him. He's a thief. He tried to go without paying me. Do you hear? Don't let him get away. No. Wait a minute. I said, no trouble from you. And you didn't listen. Signora, I'll take you now. And next you come and you come, and then, you... One moment. This one goes with us. That is, if you have no objection. No problem, Signore. I don't object. After all, I'm a peaceful man. Damned! Since when you put a man in prison because he drank a little? How many laws do you have anyway? Is it now a crime for a man to be happy? It's a crime to knife people and then to bite a policeman when he tries to stop you burn down the place. No. It was those two who provoked me. And the damn lamp fell out of my hand. And the policeman put his hand in my mouth. I only closed it. Come on get in. But I swear. Now, you be quiet. You're a brave man when there are bars between us. Coward! Guard! Come back. Don't leave me in here. What's wrong? Help! This man is mad. Let me out. I want to get out, away from this maniac. Tell me what he did to you. He tried to kill me. As soon as you turn your back, he'll go for me again. Better cut out that shouting. No. I'll keep shouting all night long. And if I hear you breath again, I'll shut your dirty, stinking mouth for you. Understand? No. You're the coward. I'm not afraid of you, if that's what's bothering you. Here's the reason for wanting my cell changed. I've been in this jail before. And the last time, no one bothered to search me. Why don't you make a racket? Stop me from going. Do you know, you're a strange person? Me If I was in your place, I'd have the guard at that door without batting an eye. It's fortunate for me my country's walls are made of mud and dried spit. I'll get you. You can't run fast enough for far enough. I'll hunt you down and kill you like the rotten beast you are. Beast? But, what about what you are? Yes, I'm a beast alright, because I have to keep running. But, can I stop to explain myself without being killed? But, you must have proof? No, not you. They told you I was guilty and right away you start running after me. You're the beast because you didn't even ask if it was true or not. But what if I give you a big laugh? What if I tell you I didn't murder that girl? It so happens, I know who did. You'd laugh too if you knew who that person really was. If you don't know already. Because if you know the truth, from now on, you'll be the one who's hunted. And you'll find you had much more fun when you were the hunter. Adieus, Amigo. You'll never get me, Amigo! Open up! You're free now. Get out! You've been cleared. San Antonio sent a telegram. You're Corbett, alright. Now, watch out! I'm not forgetting... That dirty swine, Cuchillo. Who else could escape in half an hour? So you can continue the hunt. Don't worry. No one will stop you, you know. As I already told you, here in Mexico, the Americanos and the dogs of Juarez can make trouble for each other with the approval of the authorities. May I buy it for you? Baron, ask him where in the devil he's been. Corbett, I have been looking for you for two days. No, Brockston, I don't buy your idea. Listen to me. When the telegram from the Mexican police arrived, I knew this where is from. So, I took the effort to come here personally. And I did so, not to listen to your opinion, but to clear up this matter. In amongst all this is a matter of a million dollars that never gets billed because of a despicable Mexican. Right now, the despicable Mexican means more to me than all your money or the election. But, you also belong to me, Corbett. Therefore I want that Mexican liquidated. I've my own method, Brockston. But your own method has failed. Now we'll use mine. And I guarantee you, this two-bit Mexican won't get away from me. Our gentle owner of the house is not easily offended. After all, he hopes to participate in our railroad transaction. And furthermore, he doesn't always understand our language. I've prepared all my men, Signore. They're all waiting outside the house now. That is, I trust you're still decided on it? Well, at least as sure as you are of wanting to enter into my business. Yet, I understand he's a Mexican just like you are. No. This man's a bad peon. Now, listen to me. Each one of you will be paid one hundred pesos. Is that clear? And the one who catches him will be paid... one thousand pesos. And remember, I want this Cuchillo caught. All you have to do is find him. But, turn this country upside down if you have to. But, find him. Alright now, clear off. How long will you be gone this time? I don't know. Where will you go? Somewhere I guess. Bet you don't know what you can see when you look out over these eras. This isn't Cuchillo, you fool! Sorry, Captain Segura. We seem to be having a lot of trouble tonight. What is it? Don Serrano's riders are all over the town. Armed and looking for someone. Don Serrano! He's a big gentleman. A proprietor. Pays a big tax and puts out much money for the church. What will we do? Do what I'm going to do. Go to bed. Sleep. Those who sleep don't see and don't hear. May I ask you a question, Corbett? When you are about to kill a man, what do you look at? I've asked this question of other men. And do you know what they always say? They look at his hands. I don't. I look at his eyes. Because a moment before he moves his hand, his eyes betray him. And you can always read death in them. Yours. Or his. How much longer do we have to stay in Mexico? Why don't you leave this matter by himself? Can't we go home? Don't you have too much already? For once, please don't, Chet. Cut it out! Go to hell. Leave me alone! What's happened? I'm packing my trunk tonight. I'm going home. What? I can't stand it anymore. Not with Chet. You do something like that and I'll wring your neck. But our marriage is... Yours isn't a marriage. It's an optional Miller's land over which my railroad must pass. That's a lot of capital. And you know I don't want anybody to touch that capital. You. Hey, you! Si, Signore? No. It's alright, relax. No, Signore! No. Damn you! You bundler. Didn't you learn anything the first time? Did you have to try it once more? What are you trying to say? You know damn well what I mean. When did you know I was the one? When it was too late, after you'd married my daughter. When those two red-headed friends of yours showed up at the party. You pretended you'd just saw them. I knew for a fact that you'd seen them the night before. So, I had a little talk with them like this. And what did they tell you? The truth. That you got drunk and you raped and killed that little girl and the Mexican saw you do it. So you got frightened and you blamed him. What will I do if they talk? Don't worry. They won't say anything anymore. Did you ask yourself why you haven't seen them lately? I thought they'd just gone away. They did. With Baron Von Schulenburg. Go ahead. You idiot! You think I did it for you? I did it for my daughter. I did it because I don't want anybody to know that my daughter is married to a murdering violator. Now, there's only one left. And when it's over... ... tomorrow after the Mexican is dead, then I begin to think about you. Where is he? I don't know. I haven't seen him. I don't know. I swear... Where is he? You bitch! Where is he? Talk. No, no, no! No! Let her go, you pig! What is it? Did they hurt you? No, no. But, go! Please, Cuchillo. Run! Yes. I'll send for you, Rosita. Run. Go now! Be careful. We'll be together. You'll see. Go now. I designed this holster myself. I originated it. When I realised that in America, the swiftness of the draw is more important than the precision of the shooting. I'll go and see if they've saddled the horses. The sun is rising. It looks like a big ball of blood. I say, that's an omen. What to choose... Not those. These. You know, with one of these you can stop the charge of a mad buffalo. It explodes inside of the body like that. You didn't know that hunting was my passion, did you? After making money. Yes, I've been to Africa and India looking for all types of animals to kill. But there's still one type of animal that I haven't hunted not with a gun, that is. The hunting of man. Should be interesting. They've seen it. It seems he's hidden in the cane fields. What's wrong? They don't catch him to pick up his scent. Alright. Keep them here then. Come on! No. If we stop, Corbett, we'll never catch Cuchillo. It's better if we spread out. Brockston, you take the Baron and go around that side. Chet, you come with me. You men here, go to Signore Brockston. Where is he? We gotta go on foot. You seem nervous. What are you trying to say? I'm saying, don't make any mistakes. Got that? Over there. Go on! Hold it! What a stupid idiot I've been. I always thought you were an honest man Americano. And now I see how blind I was. You will kill me to cover up the truth. Go on! You know what I'm talking about. Yeah. I know now. Drop the rifle. No. The blade. What's happened here? You're not blind. Alright. Kill him. Pull the trigger! Kill him! I could have killed him several times, Brockston. But something seemed wrong. And when you involved yourself personally in this thing, I knew it was wrong. You thought, I'd shoot first and then think, is that it? That was your mistake. You're really too damn smart to be a Senator. Alright, Baron, he's yours. Brockston, there's still a bullet left for you. Fun's over, Brockston. It's not over yet, Corbett. I'm the man in charge. You'd miss at that range. I go in that direction. I go lower. Cuchillo! But you never would have got me. Never!
