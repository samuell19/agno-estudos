You want me to write for you? How about that?! I mean... You're young, get it? I know you get it. Ok, you're not so young, you're a full grown man. Even so, what kind of man sits home all day with a cat. Not eating, not answering the phone, drinking all day. Those bottles look like soldiers. Could you turn that shit off, Hrubesch? Look.. The Russians have a saying: "Nothing that was... ugh... no... "You can't reach the... You can't sit like an ass, and just wait... and after all... what the hell are you waiting for? -Does it seem to you like I'm waiting for something? -Let's go out. Please!

Listen up, I don't need anything. I have nothing, and I want nothing. I'm not sad, I'm not happy. I'm ok. As I said. What was I saying? God damn biscuits, sucked all the whiskey. So... Don't worry about Ioana, Don't worry about me, Don't suck up... And don't let it get to you. Better put on a disc. Whatever you want, this time. -My stomach aches. Charge your phone, at least. You're right, mine aches too. -Happy Birthday! -I... -What? -Good evening! -Ok. -I... -Who are you? -My name is... -What do you want? -I came... -Huh? -Who did you say you were? -I am...because... -What time is it? -I wanted to... -Ey! Who the fuck are you, and what the fuck do you want? -Sebastian. -And? -My name is Sebastian... -And? -And, I am... I was... Ioana's boyfriend... -Coffee... I made some. I put some sugar in it, two teaspoons. I didn't put any milk, I think it's spoiled. -For how long? -Five months. more or less. I'd like... Could I look for my glasses? Outside, on the stairwell? -Come join. -No thanks, I kinda quit, back in high school. -That wasn't so long ago. I'm listening. -In... May... She was at the seaside with her colleagues, they had... Team building, is what it's called. They had rented a penthouse near Olimp. I... On the sea front, one night... It was chilly, I offered her my jacket, she started to laugh. We met after a few weeks in Bucharest. She had a schedule... I mean, yea... We started... to see each other more often. We were talking a lot. Me more than her. I told her about all my life. Well...almost all of it. She wasn't talking a lot, not about herself anyway, always seemed busy. She use to get sad, all of a sudden. I was trying to cheer her up, and then she would laugh. She would laugh with tears! I thought it was because of her work, her agency, I mean... In June, no... in July, she said she would have a free weekend. I managed to rent a room in the same penthouse. It was... Those were two of the most wonderful nights, I mean days... I mean, of my life. Almost... That's when it began... I mean, I started asking questions, I wanted to know why we see each other so rarely, Why can't I walk her home.... I knew... I suspected... but... When she left, she told me she was married. It hurt. I said it's better that I don't see her again, that we don't see each other anymore. In August she called me a few times, I didn't pick up. I was in the Delta, my uncle has a boat... I came back on the 1st of September, my uncle said a someone called.... a woman, She left a message, to call her. I called her. She enjoyed it... I think. And we decided to meet in two days. I was supposed to call her after lunch, to set the date. I called her... Just like I promised, And we decided to meet in front of the TV tower. I was there early, She used to get upset whenever I was late. I waited, then I called her, She didn't show up, not anymore. I called her that night, the next day, nothing. After two days... I saw her picture in a newspaper. I... I didn't know what to do, I looked for the address... I've been prowling for a week, I got familiar with the area, Last night I waited for the gentlemen to leave, and I... I'm here. and Happy Birthday! I mean, for yesterday. -First of all, what do you do? I work in a library, SF literature is my passion, I even wrote some stories... -Two! Where do you live? -In Sulina with my uncle, who owns the boat. -Three, what were you doing at the seaside, in May? -My uncle had sent me to get a fishing rod, from a German guy. I stopped for a day in Neptun... Fishing is a hobby of mine. -I wouldn't have thought otherwise. What do you want from me? -I want... I wanted to meet you, To tell you how sorry I am, and how much I miss... I wanted to meet you, and maybe get to know her better To see where she lived, to see her belongings, to... To ask for forgiveness from you, If you could give it. and maybe... to forgive each other. I'm lonely, I'm like a... I'm really lonely, and I can't take it. I can't speak to... My uncle only knows fishing rods, and fishing baits. I'm wretched, I can't imagine what you feel. God... If you want...If you can... maybe... I think we both need... We are... In the same boat, somewhere. Forgive me, I didn't mean to abuse fishing metaphors. Look, I'm crying. Like an idiot. I need... I think I need you. -I'm leaving now, right this second. Pick up your stuff and leave immediately. You shut the door, and take the trash out too, got it? I suppose, I hope, That I will never see you again. Still, if you decide to publicly commit suicide, I would be happy to take a look. So please let me know in due time. It would make me happy, truly. -Hello boss. -He was playing tricks, get it? -Yes. -It says so in the newspaper. -So what? -What do you mean? -Please stand still. Maybe they said so, -He said he'd kill him. No reply. He kept pulling out doves, rabbits, -Rabbits?! -White rabbits, yea! That's what they said on the TV. You know for sure! -I don't watch TV. -You're lying. -How do they know? -They caught them. You're deaf or something. They admitted everything. -And why didn't they run? -They were really scared. They froze! -Stay put, seriously. And the body? -Nowhere to be found. Is this ok like this? -Yes. They didn't find the body. -No body? -Just like that! They looked for three days, nothing. -What do you mean nothing? -Nothing! -So they put them in the mad house. -My sins! -You have plenty! Bad ones too. Even he is laughing. -How did the body disappear? -Thanks, how much? -34, sweetheart. Rodica kisses you. You don't hear a word I say! -Stand up for a sec. The house, mine, The table, mine, The bookshelf, the armchair, the sofa, the cat... whatever, mine! The typewriter, the cigarettes, mine, got it? Mine, got it or no? Jesus Christ, it hurts, fucking keys! You said you want to see? Huh? Come on, loser, come here! Is this what you wanted to see? Where she slept? Go and see! Do you like it? You like it, right? My bad, I'm careless, How about clothes? You want to see them? I know you want to! You saw them? You want more? How about her underwear? How about the stockings? I'm not done with you! What are these? Tampons? Here you go! Don't choke on them! Perfumes? Smell them, how about make up? Happy now? Want more? I have more! In the bathroom, In the garage, I can do this all day long! Crying now? What a sensitive prick! -Please forgive me! -I thought you quit. -Fishing. -I'm thirsty. -Me too. -It hurts, what the hell! -I'm sorry, it's the alcohol. You can put some marigold on it. -You'll put these back where they were. Aren't you gonna clean up? You missed one. This is starting to get exciting. Step up. Waiting for an invitation? -Good evening! -Beer or something stronger? -Something stronger. -And the gentleman? -Him too. -Lighter? -I don't have one. -You're good for nothing. -He wants to speak to you. -Do I care? -He says so. I'd go if I were you. I'll keep the gentleman company. -How's it going, friend? -It goes. -Please forgive me. Stay there! and don't speak. If you stand, I'll knock you out. and if you open your mouth, I'll beat you up. Stay there, and shut up. I'm sorry, ok? I'm really, really sorry. I regret my deed. Don't you open your mouth. Again, please forgive me. -It goes, yea? Maybe I have some good news. -I'm listening. -The local councilor. -He disappeared. -Nowhere to be found. -Nowhere? -Maybe they'll cancel the thing. -No councilor, no permit. -No permit, no demolition. -I thought you were shutting up. -Get it, pal? -I do. -You want to look for him together? -Very funny! I'll walk you to the bar. Who's this guy? Friend of yours? -Friend of my wife. -He seems a little faggy. What is he writing there? -Fuck knows. -Were you a bad boy? What did you do together? You did her together, right? -Exactly. -You need something, I'm here. -Got a light? -Don't get smart! -Sure, take as many as you want! -I don't like that guy. -Don't worry about it. -Do you think it's true? -I hope so! -What is true? -Do you think it was him? -I'm sure of it. -Him what? -This is the old lady's last chance. -Yep, last one. -Thank you, good evening! I still don't get it. -It's not for you to get. I think I'm drunk. Well, yea. I have a feeling I'll regret this. You can stay if you want. -Of course I do, thank you. On the couch... I slept very well. -Really? -Like a baby. And you? -Yea. I suppose I have to go back there at a certain point. -A huge favour to ask. -Yea? -If we could keep the door open. The bedroom door. -What are you doing? -I thought... I'm a little hungry. -Now you want food too. Go look in the fridge for all I care. What do you think I am, a motel? -She's out of food. -She'll get more tomorrow. Are you set? -Not really. There was some dry salami in the fridge. -Are you allergic to that? -No, but... -But what? -I... -I don't eat meat, since high school. -Is that so? How about the fish? -I let them go. I catch them, then I let them go. -Hold on, so you're telling me you catch the fish and instead of eating it, you throw it back. -Well yes, I don't kill them. -I see, so you're also stupid. -So you pierce their flesh, you pull them out, they're suffocating, and instead giving meaning to their suffering, you let them go back to their family with a pierced lip, not being able to ever play the saxophone again. What do you call this torture? -Sport fishing. -Oh yea? It doesn't sound like sport to me. I find it stupid. Whatever, you're the expert. Instead of preparing it with some nice garlic sauce, You know where "mujdei" (garlic sauce) comes from,right? -It's Turkish, right? -It's french, you idiot! -What do you mean it's french? -Just like that. -"Mousse d'ail", "mujdei" in Romanian. -"Mousse d'ail" -So next time you hear someone say garlic "mujdei", tell them to shove it up their ass, because I said so, ok? Hey, listen! I'd like to know... I'm curious, you suspect, she confirms, alright, and you don't dare ask, out of courtoisie, who's the guy, who is he? Is he Turkish, french, is he fat, slim? Is he stupid, is he an idiot, who is he? And why? What's wrong with him? What did he do to her, Why? What didn't he do? why? Huh? Weren't you a little curious? Not even a little? -Of course I asked. How couldn't I? She didn't answer. She started to cry and didn't answer. She didn't?! Ask her again, maybe she will. END OF THE FIRST PART PART TWO -Wake up, the sun is shining. -What sun? -Hello! Yes, I've decided, Is it ok if I bring someone? A gentleman, of course! I agree. Thank you! One o'clock, as always? I haven't forgotten, no. Yes, on time. Clean yourself up, we're invited to lunch. -Lunch? I think I need a shirt. -What now? -Now is the time. -Where are we going? -Didn't you say "Maria Rosetti" Street? -Didn't you say you wanted to know her better? -This is Sebastian. -What a pleasure! -This is Sebastian, a buddy of mine. -You were a little naughty, huh? -True. -Is the table set? -It was ready at one, Now it's 1:20, please take a seat. -The major had a Setter, just like that one, Irish breed, red hair, smart, wonderful dog. -This is some good roe! -Very good, indeed! -Don't you want some? -No, thank you! -Pops? -I'll have some. -They poisoned him...the scoundrels. -Could I perhaps bring the soup? -Of course! -He was ill for three days and then he died. -He was twelve, poor dog. -Could you imagine, torturing a dog like this? -No, I don't want to imagine. -For pheasant hunting, biggle are the best! -No question about it. -Plate, please. -For partridges too. -Plate. -Not to mention rabbits. -Plate. -You can't go wrong with the biggle. -What soup is this? -Chicken soup à la Grec. -Why? -Never mind. -Try not to sip loudly. -It's delicious. Nice and hot, very good. Give it a try. -I will. -If you want to hunt wild ducks, cocker spaniel, there's no other way! A little too salty. -Oh, really? -A terrier for example... -Why don't you eat, sir? Does it have bones? - I don't really.... -We all know it's very pretentious. -Mr. Radulescu, the lawyer, had one... it died of old age... the dog I mean... -I would like some wine, the one I brought, yours is a little dry. -Go ahead. -Did you ever had a dog that died? -No...not really. -I propose a toast. -It's a little sour... -It seems tender. Doesn't it look tender? -More potatoes for me, please. -Forget about them, meat is better. Eat while it's warm. -Mr. Pomponiu had a teckel by the name of pistachio. -It's divine, truly divine. -Did you taste it? -Right now. -It's not as good if it gets stale. -It was a pleasure to leave the house, just to see how happy he was when you returned. He would jump, and jump... -I don't really like pig... -I have some brine as well. -I don't really do fish... -And one day, Mr. Pomponiu comes home early... -Are you a vegetarian? -Yes, I try to be. -I see. I also have boeuf salad, without boeuf. -And pulls out of his pocket a little kitty. -A litt... -Does anybody else want a change of menu? -A poor little kitty. -A baby kitten? -Pistachio sees him and runs to the kitchen, and stays there for hours. Everyone was in love with him, played with him, fed him... -Why don't you mind your plate? -I am, darling. -Pistachio was sad, he wasn't eating, wasn't playing, nothing... -He was jealous! -Indeed. -How did you too meet? Do you work together? -Will you tell her? -We collaborated for a while. -The people in the house were worried. -Not anymore? -Not anymore. -What's with the dog?! -And where do you work? -They gave them pills... -In a library, I'm a writer... -Writer? and where do you live? are you married? -Pomponiu has an idea. He puts the kitty and the dog face to face. -No, I live in Sulina with my uncle. -And your parents? -They look at each other... for a minute, two, three... -The died ten years ago. -Sorry to hear...what do you write? -And the kitten... -The kitty approaches Pisatchio, and puts his paws on the dog's none. -Science fiction stories. -I suppose you know it doesn't pay well. -From that moment on, best friends. -I know, of course. -They ate together, slept together... -Did you know Ioana? -I... -We met briefly last summer. -Listen to this! -When he was walking the dog, the kitty was so angry... meowing, scratching... -I'll go get the desert. -What do you think he did? -What? -He bought another leash, and he would walk them together. -Tarte Tatin, her favorite... -What was I saying... A leash in one hand, and one in the other. Guess what they called the kitty. -How do you know that? -What? -The only possible name: -Date! Pistachio and Date. -How do you know that? -What do you mean? -Mr. Sebastian was Ioana's boyfriend for five months. More or less, right? -Thank you for everything. For the food, the stories, everything. It was magnificent as always, I can't wait for next time. Now we have to go, because we have other places to be. -I will walk you... I must confess, I always wanted a basset, it has sad eyes, but they're so full of dignity, and loyal... Sure, they eat a lot... But they're adorable! Intelligent too! Even if sometimes, not always... they steal food. A dog that steals! Did you ever hear something like that? I always wanted a basset... -Thank you! -A cigarette doesn't hurt... -Could we walk? -We could if we went home. -Taxi! -You can smoke inside. -Of course I can. TOUCH OF EVIL -I shouldn't've eaten popcorn. -Maybe you should've eaten less at lunch. -Thanks, Doc! -You need a Colebil, maybe a tea... and we also need something else. -Taxi! -It will pass 'till marriage. -I should get an anti-rabies shot. -I know that dog since forever, it's clean. -Maybe we should give him a shot. -Well, wine... after whiskey? -Are you managing me now? I suppose you want some too. You lost some blood. -I could have a glass, yes. -Well let's have a glass! -Should we put on a record? I think I also need some pants. -Pants? Record? Have I taken you in? And afterward we set up the table? We dance? What do we do? Listen...do you think we're friends? Who do you take me for? Let's make it clear! You are a guest, that's all! An unwelcome one too. So drink your wine, dress up, and scram. Got it? I want to be alone. -I don't believe you. -What's that? I didn't hear you. -I don't believe you. What don't you believe? -I don't believe you want to be alone, because I don't want that. But you can believe that if you want. I'll finish my glass, and I'll go. -So you're doing me a favour? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Fucking my wife doesn’t make you a philosopher. -Alexandru... -Sebastian...am I wrong? Didn't you fuck her? Of course you did. -Are you ashamed now? Repeat after me: I fucked your wife, say it, I fucked your wife! -Crying again? I have bad news for you, my wife's dead. And nobody gives a shit about your stupid philosophy... Aren't you gonna answer? Don't you feel like home? -Hello, good evening! Don't worry about it. Yes. No, it's not possible. Because it's not possible. Because he's not here. He's not coming back. He's not coming back ever. I'm also sorry. Good night. I don't think you deserved her. I don't think you ever did. -And you? Did you deserve her? -I... -You didn't, you idiot, 'cause she was crushed by that car. Crushed. When she was coming to you, idiot. They picked her up piece by piece. Idiot! -Yes. Yes. Yes.. I can call them right now if you let me. I'm telling you. Stop nagging me. -Are you sleeping or what? -I'm not changing my mind. Just because...Mind your Hrubesch. -Good afternoon, Ms. Minerva. -She got so fat! What did you feed her? -It's a "He". -Hello. -Bring the ladder, it's already lunch time! -Bring the ladder! -Get dressed! -I'm very serious! Extremely serious! -Don't give me the ladder. Get up and open it. -Half and hour tops. -I'm also sorry! But I don't care! Yes, I'm aware. -Hold it for a sec. -I don't need to do that. -Put some newspapers on the ground so it doesn't get dirty. -I couldn't care less. -These should be fine, right? -When is this one from? -I don't really feel like speaking right now. No, because I don't care! You can handle it without me. That's why. Yes. Yes. Exactly. -It's busy. -Hurry up! What's that? -Wasn't speaking to you. Listen, I wish you have beautiful day, good projects.... And a blossoming career. Bye! -Jeez! It's full of dust. But it's well done. -I hired you to work, not to admire the ceiling. -We're working, ma'am. Hurry up! -It's stuck. -Give it a push. -I'm pushing, but... -If you break it, we cut it from your pay. -Could I ask you where you're going? -To the seaside, mom. -What do you mean, when? -Right now. -Right now? -The weather's not bad, my cousin went fishing on Saturday. -Mind your business. -With whom? -With this gentleman. -Good morning. -You had stranger ideas in the past, and I would be very grateful if you would tell me who he is. -What do you mean, dear mother? This gentleman is Sebastian, he was Ioana's lover. -And why is he wearing your shirt? It's a gift from Pusa. -Better don't ask.. a shirt doesn't matter. You ready? We go. -Pardon? -It's my turn now. -It's stuck. -Unstuck it! -Will it take long? -Half an hour tops. -You can leave the keys with Aurel, he can feed her. -Nice meeting you! -Watch out on the highway! -How else? -Bye bye. -I told you it won't be finished before lunch. -Italian brand. Open the gate! -Could you tell me... -Just come on already. -You'll scratch it! -Mind your business! -Close the gate! -I don't know where we're going, but... I have a huge favour to ask. Before...could we go see her? I want to see her again, please! -That's what you get if you don't put your seat belt on. -There you go, they're mints. Thermoplastic country. Let's go, there's nothing left here. -I'm sorry, I can't, I don't think I can. -No trace of balls. I don't know what she saw in you. Congratulations! You left us like two idiots, too. -Yes, I'm with him. Do you want to speak to him? Maybe I'll throw him out of the car. Yes, I'll keep you updated. Tell Hrubesch I said hi. I once burred a cat here, do you want to see it too? What do you want? -First of all, it's way too loud. It's really good, but loud. Second of all, where are we going? -It's a surprise. -I don't like surprises. -No, really? and when you showed up to my door telling me you were my wife's affair? ain't that a surprise? -Affair is not my favorite word. -For semantic polemics you don't need to fuck my wife. -I don't get why do you speak like that? -You'll get it when you grow up. Tell me when and if you have to pee, is that clear? -It's here, under the hood. -Yes, I knew that! -Go and get me a beer, and get yourself something too. -You should've gotten a big bag! Did you leave anything on the shelves? -I get car sick if I don't eat. -You better don't get sick. Where's my beer? Nice and cold. -Watch out! -Shut up, bitch! What's this shit? -Beer. -With no alcohol? -Well, you're driving. -I'm driving my ass. -What more do you want? -I need to go to the toilet. I need to pee. -Why didn't you pee when we stopped? -I didn't need to. -And now? -Now I do. -Sure...don't hurry! -Are you sure this is a good idea? -The best one. -Would you like a drink? -One of those. -And another one for me. -Do you still think this is a good idea? Because I don't think so. It seems to me a very bad idea. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry I came to look for you. I don't think I need you. You don't need me for sure. You don't need anybody. And I'm starting to get a feeling nobody needs you either. Thank you. -Anything else? -No, thanks. I can look you in the eye and tell you loud and clear: I loved her. I love her, I'll keep loving her. I miss her. I miss... the face she made when she had her coffee, how she avoided sunlight, I miss... in the morning when... It hurts! It hurts so bad I want to vomit. I'll keep on crying, You can't help me, even if you wanted to... I had the moral duty to come, to see you, to apologize. I didn't mean any harm. I'm sorry. God... I'm sorry I came. -Very touching. Do you have more? -How can you just not care?! How can you just mock me? Mock me, I get it, but mocking her? -Watch your tone! -Please shut up! Please! We could've helped... each other. But you're selfish, and mean. You can't... see. You're alone, you have no friends. And I have the feeling that all the shit that you've been telling me, some well deserved, you actually told yourself. You needed to hear them, you needed to harm yourself. To see if and what... you still feel. It's all clear now. You don't feel...anything. -What would you know, you schmuck, about selfishness? About loneliness? About feelings? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? What do you know about friends? What do you know about love, if we're talking about it? You know shit. Since you showed up, you've been talking stupid. You saw the bedroom, you cried, I played you her favorite music, you cried, I took you to her parents, you sat there like an idiot. I took you to see her favorite film, you said absolutely nothing. I don't even know if you... Have you got any hobbies? Do you believe in anything? Don't say God, or I'll smack you again. A book? A band, a movie? Do you like any actors? Do you? -I do. Charlton...Heston. -Go to hell... go to hell... -What are you doing with that notepad? you're driving me crazy! Are you taking notes? writing thoughts, sketching? what? -I know I love her. I can tell you that I love her. I'm not ashamed to say it. Can you? I don't think you can! You're an impotent, you're a drunk, you're alone. Impotent, an alcoholic, and alone. If you want to smack me again... -You're... the biggest imbecile I ever saw. Don't change that. -Fucking... -You hit yourself, oh God! -Please forgive me. -You got injured, not me. -No, I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Where are you running at this hour? -I... Have you seen a tall man, short hair, beard? -Mr. Alexandru? No, I didn't. Is he here? -Do you know him? -Yes, I've known him for seven years. They had their honeymoon here, and they've been coming ever since, in the begging of autumn, when it's less hot. They had so many parties here on the terrace. One year they had a cooking contest, in another one a graffiti contest. They left so much mess behind, but it was my pleasure. They were sweet, generous. Especially the lady, I would've been sad not to see them this year. Is the lady here as well? Are you feeling ill? I knew you got hurt. -Don't worry, I'm fine. I... have to go, good night. -If you say so. -Tell them Magdalena said hi. I'll come see them tomorrow. A FILM BY TO IOANA Subtitles by: marcelbrusc
