Narrator: IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS CHAOS AND ETERNAL NIGHT. AND A VOICE SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND THE DARK WAS SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHT. THERE WAS CREATED THE WATERS AND THE LAND. AND THEY WERE MADE-- THE SUN TO RULE THE DAY AND THE MOON TO RULE THE NIGHT AND THE STARS TO GIVE LIGHT TO THE DARKNESS. THE EARTH WAS MADE TO BEAR GROWING GREEN THINGS AND FRUIT. THE ANIMALS WERE CREATED, AND THEY WERE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLIED. AND THEN THERE CAME... MAN. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT AYE! [ALL SHOUTING] WHERE'S THE BOY? BEYOND THE RIVER? YOU KNOW THE LAW. AYE. BUT YOU WENT BEYOND THE RIVER. WELL, ONLY A LITTLE WAY. THINGS ARE THERE. ELK ANIMALS WITH THEIR SHOULDERS AS HIGH AS MY HEAD. SMALL CREATURES ALL AROUND. IT'S FORBIDDEN. WHY? THE LAW. THE LAW HOLDS US FROM THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE PLAIN. THE LAW HOLDS US FROM THE THINGS THAT SWIM IN THE RIVER, THE CREATURES THAT FILL THE FOREST, THE FRUITS OF THE GROWING TREES. WHAT KIND OF LAW? THE LAW THAT'S GIVEN AND GOOD. IN THE PLAIN, WE SICKEN AND DIE, RED AND DRIED OUT. AND THERE. WHY DO WE HUNT IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE DEAD TREES AND ONLY A FEW ANIMALS TO GIVE THE FIRE WHEN THERE'S PLENTY THERE? THAT PLACE IS FORBIDDEN ABOVE ALL. PROMISES A LOT BUT GIVES ONLY A PLACE TO DIE. THERE ARE SHADOWS THERE DEEP AND COLD AND DIRT THAT EATS MEN AND ANIMALS FAR MORE TERRIBLE THAN YOU'VE SEEN AND OTHER THINGS. YOU SAW THEM. AND YOU WERE THERE BEYOND THE RIVER. AYE. ONCE. ONLY ONCE. I WONDERED AS YOU DO. AND BECAUSE I DID, I TELL YOU TO LISTEN TO THE LAW AND HOLD TO IT. THIS OTHER THING. IT IS CALLED BY A NAME. THE GOD THAT GIVES DEATH WITH ITS TOUCH. WHAT IS IT LIKE? IT'S TIME TO RETURN. WHEN IT'S DARK, WE'LL MAKE THE SYMBOLS FOR THE HUNT. HE WILL NEVER REACH THE RIGHTS OF MANHOOD. WHA-- COME. WHY DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO? WHY DO YOU KEEP SUCH A SMALL FIRE? IT'S THE FIRST OF THE 3 GREAT GIFTS OF MAN. WHY SHOULD YOU SIT HERE AND TEND IT WHEN IT IS ALL AROUND AT EVERY COOK FIRE, WHEN IT CAN BE MADE FROM THE FIRE ROCK? IT'S THE FIRST OF THE 3 GREAT GIFTS OF MAN. WHAT GOOD IS IT TO WORSHIP A THING THAT TURNS? IT IS THE SECOND OF THE GREAT GIFTS OF MAN. DO YOU QUESTION THE KEEPERS OF THE GIFTS OFTEN? NO. I KNOW WHY YOU DO. I DID ONCE MYSELF. WHY TEND TO SMALL FIRE? WHY SPIN A WHEEL THAT HAS LITTLE USE? AND MORE THAN THAT, WHY BUILD IN ORDER TO BREAK? YES. WHY DOES HE? WHY DO YOU BUILD AND BREAK? IT'S THE THIRD GIFT TO MAN AND THE FIRST GREAT LESSON. HE ALWAYS SAYS THE SAME. THEY ALL DO. IT IS THE WORD OF THE LAW. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT WILL TAKE A BRAVE, STRONG MAN TO KNOW THAT. NOTHING CAN BE LEARNED IN THIS PLACE. THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO TEACH YOU. BEFORE THE HUNT, 2 MAKERS OF SYMBOLS THERE WILL BE. THE SYMBOL MAKERS ARE THE DREAMS OF THE PEOPLE, ARE THE TELLERS TO GOD OF THE PEOPLE, ARE THE TESTS OF THE PEOPLE. THE SYMBOL MAKERS ARE THE EVIL AND THE DEATH AND THE DARKNESS AND THE MASTERS OF FIRE. THE SYMBOL MAKERS ARE THE LIGHT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE GLORY AND THE LIFE. LET THE SYMBOLS BE MADE. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN SYMBOL MAKERS? WE HAVE FACED 5 TIMES OUR OWN LIFE IN THE BURIAL CAIRNS. WHY ARE WE THE SYMBOL MAKERS OUT OF ALL THE CLAN? WE HAVE THE GIFT TO SEE VISIONS AND THE SKILL IN WHICH TO PICTURE THEM. IT IS BEST THAT SUCH SKILL SERVE THE LAW. DO THE SYMBOLS REALLY BRING THE ANIMALS INTO OUR HANDS SO THAT WE CAN KILL THEM? YOU ASK MANY THINGS LATELY. I WONDER. DO YOU ASK THEM OF ANY OF THE CLAN BUT ME? THEY TELL ME NOTHING. I TELL YOU THIS. IT IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAW TO QUESTION THE SIGNS AND GIFTS AND MYSTERIES OF THE GODS. ONE THING. THIS, UH, THING THAT GIVES DEATH WITH ITS TOUCH. YOU SAW IT? NO. THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S SO TERRIBLE? I WAS SHOWN ITS LOOK BY THE SYMBOL MAKER BEFORE ME. SHOW ME. IT IS BIGGER THAN A MAN BUT NOT SO BIG AS THE GREAT ANIMALS. IT HAS A SKIN NO THROWING SPEAR OR DART CAN PIERCE. AND ITS CLAWS ARE LIKE THOSE OF THE GREAT SWAMP CREATURES. THEY HOLD AND MOVE LIKE A MAN'S. OUT THERE BEYOND THE RIVER, IT RULES ALL THINGS. ALL THINGS FEAR IT. THE LAW WAS GIVEN TO US TO KEEP US SAFE. IT IS HARD NOT TO QUESTION, BUT UNLESS WE LIVE BY THE WORD AND THE LAW, DEATH WILL COME TO US. WONDER NO MORE. I WONDER STILL. THE SYMBOLS ARE MADE. WHEN THE FIRE COMES BACK TO THE SKY, THE MEN OF YEARS WILL MAKE THE FIRST HUNT. [RATTLING] [GROWLING] [YELLING] THE HUNTERS RETURN. THE GRAY LEAVES. [GROANS] ANOTHER HURT IN THE HUNT. THIS TIME YOUR OWN BLOOD. ONE BRAVE MAN COULD GET MEAT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FIRES HOT FOR MANY DAYS OF THE SUN. THE LAW FORBIDS GOING BEYOND THE RIVER. AH, THE LAW'S STRANGE, HARD TO KNOW ABOUT. IT IS THE WORD THAT DEATH WILL BE GIVEN TO THE ONE WHO GOES THERE. AYE. WE'RE ALL AFRAID. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT IS BEYOND THE BURNING PLAIN? BEYOND THE RIVER? FARTHER. PERHAPS BEYOND THE GREAT, GREEN FOREST. IF MY LEGS COULD BEAR ME, I'D FIND OUT. WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY OF HE WHO WOULD QUESTION THE LAW? HE MUST BE PUNISHED. HOW? ALL WILL KEEP THEIR VOICES FROM HIM FOR A TIME ACCORDING TO THE YEARS. AND IF THE LAW'S BROKEN SO THAT EVIL COMES TO THE CLAN? DEATH. AYE. DOWN HIM! DOWN HIM! DOWN! DOWN HIM! DOWN! [LAUGHING] THE MEAT OF THE THIRD BEAST WON'T LAST LONG. A NEW HUNT WILL GO UNTO THE FOREST AND BEAR TREES WHERE ONLY KILLING THINGS ROAM. ONLY A FEW STEPS BEYOND THE RIVER, THERE IS MEAT APLENTY, WAITING TO BE KILLED. A SINKING EARTH IS OUT THERE. WELL, THEN WE WILL TEST THE STEP AHEAD WITH THE SPEAR. THE PLACE SMOKES AND FIRE BURSTS FROM THE ROCKS. ANIMALS AS BIG AS CAVES WILL BE ON THE RIVER. THEY ARE SO BIG, AND WE ARE SO SMALL. THEY WON'T SEE US. THE GOD THAT GIVES DEATH WITH A TOUCH IS THERE. HAVE YOU SEEN IT? HAS ANYONE OF THE CLAN SEEN IT? THE GRAY BEARD TELLS OF THE GOD. A LONG AGO WHEN HE COULD REACH NO HIGHER THAN MY KNEE. ARE WE TO BE MADE AFRAID BY AN OLD ONE'S BABY DREAM? THE LAW... IS OLD. BUT AGE IS NOT ALWAYS TRUTH. HOW MANY WILL GO WITH ME? NOT EVEN THE HUNTERS OF YEARS WILL GO AFTER THE DARK. AT THE FIRST LIGHT THEN. ARE ALL THE MEN GATHERED? ALL THE FOOLS. I WILL BE HERE TO PLACE YOUR BODIES IN THE CAIRNS IF THE CLAN CAN FIND WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU. GET AWAY. THERE'S MEAT HERE. KILL AND GO BACK. NO. I CAME TO FIND THE TRUTH OR LIE OF THE OLD STORIES. THE ANCIENT LAW. WE CAME TO HUNT, NOT TO DESTROY THE WORD. I CAME TO GIVE THIS EARTH TO THE CLAN. [GROWLING] THE GREAT ANIMALS. OR THE GOD. [WHISTLING] [SNARLING] HO! HO! HELP! THE SINKING EARTH! HELP! HELP! YOU'VE GIVEN ONE OF THE CLAN TO THE EARTH. THEY'VE RETURNED! THEY'RE BACK! THE BLOOD IS CLEAN. THE SYMBOL MAKER WAKES. HE ASKS AFTER HIS SON. THE BOY. BRING HIM TO ME. BRING HIM. HE IS NOT HERE. WHERE THEN? BEYOND THE RIVER. WHEN? A TIME AGO. HOW LONG HAS HE GONE? 2 RISINGS OF THE SUN. WHO KNOWS OF THIS? ALL THE CLAN. HE TOOK OTHERS WITH HIM. YOUR SON HAS BROKEN THE LAW. HE IS BEYOND THE RIVER. YOUR BLOOD WILL BRING THE DEATH TO VISIT US AS IT WAS TOLD IN TIMES PAST. BOY. TELL ME. YOUR SON LED US TO GO BEYOND THE RIVER. WE SAW TERRIBLE THINGS. GREAT BEASTS FIGHTING. ONE OF US WAS TAKEN BY THE EARTH. WHICH ONE? THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY. AND MY SON? WE LEFT HIM THERE. LEFT HIM? HE DIDN'T FOLLOW US BACK. HE'S DEAD. BUT THE EVIL WILL COME ALL THE SAME. HE'S BROUGHT IT DOWN UPON US. NO. I WILL FIND HIM, BRING HIM BACK. WHEN I AM STRONG. AT THE SUN'S THIRD RISING. [THUD] [BARKING] [YELPS] WE LIVE BY THE WORD. WE DIE WITHOUT IT. IT IS TOLD THAT THE BREAKER OF THE LAW MUST BE PUT TO DEATH. THIS YOUNG ONE BROKE THE LAW AND THE EVIL GODS WILL COME DOWN TO KILL, AS IN TIMES PAST. THE ELDER KEEPER OF THE LAW KNOWS THIS IS TRUTH. THE SON OF THE SYMBOL MAKER... MUST DIE. [SHOUTING] HEY! EACH OF US HAS WANDERED AFTER THE TRUTH. THE WORD TELLS US THAT THE LAW IS TRUTH. THIS ONE HAS BROKEN THE LAW. BUT STILL THE GODS HAVE NOT COME AS IT'S TOLD THEY WILL COME. [MURMURING] EVIL IS NEAR US. THE CLAN WILL BE NO MORE. I SAY ONLY TO WAIT UNTIL IT DOES COME. AND I SAY IT MUST BE KEPT FROM THE PEOPLE BY ANOTHER DEATH. THE WORD OF THE LAW IS TRUTH. LET THE GUILTY ONE BE AS DEAD UNTIL MANHOOD. [SHOUTING] NO! NO! IT SHALL BE AS THE SYMBOL MAKER SAYS. ENOUGH! [WHISTLING] STAY. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT TO GIVE VOICE TO ME OR I TO YOU. LISTEN. LISTEN TO THIS VOICE THEN. THAT VOICE I'VE HEARD AT NIGHT IN THE LIFE OF DREAMS. I CAME TO FIND IT BEYOND THE RIVER. IT IS NOT A BAD PLACE THAT GIVES THE VOICE OF DREAMS. THERE ARE STRANGE THINGS. SO I WONDER... HOW MANY STRANGE THINGS THERE ARE BEYOND THE RIVER. EVEN BEYOND THE GREEN PLACE. NO. IF YOU BREAK THE LAW AGAIN, THE PEOPLE WILL GIVE YOU DEATH. I SHOULDN'T GIVE YOU MY VOICE UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN AFTER THE RITES OF MANHOOD. WONDER NO MORE. I WILL ALWAYS WONDER. Man: LOOK. IT COMES FROM THE PLAIN. GET THE WOMEN IN THE CAVE. BRING THE WEAPONS. WHAT IS IT? SOME THING. SOME BEAST FROM BEYOND THE BURNING PLAIN. AND THE WORD SAYS NOTHING CAN LIVE THERE... OR BEYOND. WHAT IS IT? WHAT KIND OF BEAST IS THIS? STRANGE. IT'S EVIL. SEE, THE EVIL COMES. BUT NOT FROM THE PLACE I'VE BEEN. WHAT IS THIS THING THEN? THE ANCIENT TALES TELL OF SUCH THINGS. WHAT THINGS? BEASTS WITH SUCH A SHAPE. MAN AND CREATURE. IT HAS HIDE ALL OVER EXCEPT ARMS AND LEGS IN THE MIDDLE. I SAY IT IS EVIL. KILL IT. KILL. LOOK. IT MOVES. IT IS NO ONE BEAST, BUT A MAN ON TOP AN ANIMAL. THERE IS NO SUCH THING. NO MAN CAN STAY A BEAST. IT IS THERE BEFORE YOU. I SAY KILL IT BEFORE IT BRINGS SICKNESS AND DEATH. BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE. THERE ARE MEN LIKE THE MEN OF THE CLAN BEYOND THE BURNING PLAIN. IT IS NOT LIKE US. IT IS SOME ANIMAL. SEE THE HAIR IT WEARS. SPEAK WITH THIS MAN. DON'T KILL HIM. KILL HIM. IT CAME TO KILL THE CLAN, TO BRING PESTILENCE AND DEATH. KILL THE BEAST. KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! STAND AWAY. NO. THERE IS MUCH TO LEARN FROM THIS MAN. HEAR HIM. LEARN. HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP OUR EYES TURNED FROM THE TRUTH? THE MARK IS ON YOU DEEP. EVIL SEEKS EVIL. EVIL PROTECTS EVIL. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING AGAINST THE LAW OR THE WORD HERE. THIS IS A BRAVE MAN WHO HAS DARED TO SEEK OUT OTHERS OF HIS KIND. STAND AWAY, BOY. I WILL NOT. TAKE HIM. KILL HIM. PEACE. [GRUNTS] YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH. HE CRIED "PEACE." MY EYES WERE OPENED. BUT YOUR DEATH WOULD'VE DONE NO GOOD. HE MAY HAVE HAD ANSWERS. PERHAPS THE TRUTH OF THE LAW. A LAW IS TRUTH TO ITSELF. WE MUST FIND A NEW LAW. WILL WE? WE'LL TRY. THE WORD HAS GUIDED US FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY TIME CAN CHANGE IT. MAKE A CAIRN TO LAY THIS MAN TO REST. A CAIRN FOR AN EVIL THING? MAKE A CAIRN. THIS DAY A MAN WAS KILLED. IT LOOKED LIKE A MAN. BUT HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT IT WAS? EVIL GODS TAKE STRANGE SHAPES. THEY DO NOT DIE BLEEDING. IT WAS A MAN. OUT OF THE BURNING PLAIN. BUT THAT PLACE IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAW. SO ANY CREATURE CROSSING IT MUST BE FORBIDDEN, TOO. WE MEET HERE TO CHANGE THE LAW. THE WORD OF OUR FATHER'S CHANGED? THAT IS A DANGEROUS THOUGHT. IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR THE MAN WHO CROSSED FROM THE MOUNTAINS. ARE WE TO BE BLIND TO THE TRUTH SUNG BY HIS COMING? SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE PLAIN, THERE ARE OTHER CLANS, OTHER PEOPLE. LET THEM STAY THERE AND WE HERE. NO. WE MUST TRY TO FIND THEM. THERE ARE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR FATHERS TO GIVE THEM, THINGS THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED TO GIVE US. EVIL TALK. STAY. THERE IS LITTLE ENOUGH FOOD HERE. HOW CAN ENOUGH BE GATHERED TO CARRY AWAY? IN THE FOREST BEYOND THE RIVER. YOU WOULD BREAK THE LAW TWICE. AYE. A HUNDRED TIMES. THE LAW WAS JUST. THE WORD WAS GOOD. IT SHOWED THE WAY FOR THE CLAN. BUT THIS MAN'S COMING HAS CHANGED THE LAW. NO. AND ANYONE WHO SPEAKS SO SHOULD HOLD NO POWER AS SYMBOL MAKER. I CLAIM THAT POWER FOR MYSELF. ISN'T THIS THE WAY? IT IS SAID THAT WHEN A MAN OF POWER IN THE CLAN BREAKS THE LAW, HIS CHALLENGER TAKES HIS PLACE. WE HAVE HEARD IT ALL. THE SYMBOL MAKER HAS BROKEN WITH HIS FAITH BY HIS OWN WORDS. WOULD YOU ROUSE THE CLAN TO KILL ME, TOO? IF IT IS NOT THAT THE LAW IS WRONG, I WILL GIVE MY POWER TO HIM. THE LAW HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY THIS COMING THIS DAY. BUT THE WORD MUST STILL FORBID THE CROSSING OF THE BURNING PLAIN. OUR FATHERS OF YEARS HAVE LIVED IN THE SHELTER OF THE GREAT ROCK. IT IS ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD DO THE SAME. BUT THE MAN... THE WORD OF THE LAW HAS BEEN SPOKEN. THEY WANT TO BE SAFE. SAFE? SAFE TO LIVE AND DIE IN A SINGLE PLACE. YOU? I FOUGHT. I AM NO MORE THE SYMBOL MAKER. BUT I'LL STAY TO THE LAW, AND YOU MUST, TOO. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THE CLAN CAN BE KEPT. SOON THE NIGHT GLOW WILL SET IN THE RIGHT PLACE IN THE SKY, AND YOU WILL COME TO MANHOOD AND HEAR SILENCE NO MORE. YOU ARE GIVING ME YOUR VOICE. THIS ONCE. A GREATER EVIL THAN YOURS WAS DONE THIS DAY. THE SUN HAS PASSED THROUGH THE SKY TO MARK A TIME OF YEARS. ONE OF THE CLAN HAS COME TO MANHOOD. [RATTLING] WILL YOU HOLD TO THE WORD? WILL YOU HOLD TO THE WORD? AYE. WILL YOU HOLD TO THE LAW? AYE. ONE OF THE CLAN HAS COME TO MANHOOD. COME. SEE THE SYMBOLS LEFT BY THE GODS. THIS WAS A MESSAGE FROM GOD. IT CAME IN FIRE AND MADE A GREAT WOUND UPON THE EARTH. TO TOUCH THE THINGS OF THE GODS CAN GIVE YOU DEATH. WELL, HAS NO ONE EVER TOUCHED THEM? IT'S THE WORD OF THE LAW. YOU'VE SEEN THE GOD SYMBOLS. GO AND TAKE YOUR PLACE AS A MAN OF YEARS IN THE CLAN. YOU GAVE THE PROPER ANSWERS TO THE RITUAL. BUT I FELT YOU WEREN'T SPEAKING TRUE. YOU WON'T GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS, WILL YOU? YOU TOOK THE PLACE OF MY FATHER. YOU WANT ME AWAY, TOO? I HOPE YOU HOLD TO THE LAW. BUT A BRAVE MAN'S DREAMS ARE HARD THINGS TO FIGHT. WHENEVER WE GO INTO THE CAVE OF SYMBOLS TO MAKE A RITUAL, STAY BEFORE MY EYES. WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN WHO WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE THE LEADER OF A SMALL CLAN. I WANT TO LEAD NO ONE. I WANT TO GO ON TO BROADER PLACES. TWO SUCH MEN WILL COME TO FIGHT ONE DAY. AND ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD BY THE OTHER'S HAND. IT CAME TO ME THAT WE MIGHT MAKE A PLACE OF OUR OWN. HIGHER ON THE CAVE ROCK, YOU COULD DIG OUT A SPACE. IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. AYE. WE COULD MAKE A PLACE TO LIE DOWN ON, A SPACE ABOVE THE FLOOR SO THE COLD COULDN'T REACH US AS WE SLEPT. AYE. WHEN WILL YOU START? NO. BEYOND THE RIVER, THERE ARE WARM SKINS OF SO MANY ANIMALS THAT A SLEEPING PLACE COULD BE MADE OF THEM. AND THERE ARE GROWING THINGS THERE THAT ARE SOFT TO LIE ON. AND THE PLACE SMELLS OF WIND AND FRESH THINGS. WE MUST STAY HERE. SO MAKE A SLEEPING PLACE FOR US ON THE HIGH PATH. WHAT DOES HE DO? HE MAKES A SLEEPING PLACE FOR HIM AND HIS WOMAN. WHY? THE OLD CAVES ARE BIG ENOUGH FOR ALL. THERE IS NO WORD OF LAW AGAINST IT. FOOL. AYE. YOU KEPT ME AT THIS SLEEPING PLACE A LONG, LONG TIME. AYE. BUT I WONDER STILL. SOMEONE MUST BREAK THE LAW, MUST FIND THE TRUTH FOR ALL AND FOREVER. NO. OF ALL THE THINGS THE CLAN FEARS-- THE GOD THAT BRINGS DEATH WITH ITS TOUCH--THE MOST, I'LL FIND IT AND KILL IT. GIVE ME SOME FOOD. NOW. DO AS I SAY. I HEAR YOU IN ALL THINGS BUT NOT IN THIS. WHY SHOULD YOU BE THE ONE TO BREAK THE LAW? EVERY MAN HOLDS TO THE OLD LAW AS THE SAFE WAY. EACH WAITS FOR ANOTHER TO DARE. NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE THE RISKS THAT A BETTER LIFE DEMANDS. EVERY WOMAN POINTS TO A MAN OTHER THAN HER OWN TO DO THE DYING. SO THE AGES PAST, AND THE CLAN REMAINS HUDDLED IN THE SAME PLACE. THERE IS NO MORE TO SAY. IT IS A TIME TO ACT. WHERE DID HE GO? BEYOND THE RIVER? AYE. OUR SON HAS GONE. NO. I MUST BRING HIM BACK. IT MEANS DEATH SURELY TO BREAK THE LAW TWICE. AND YOU'LL BE GIVEN DEATH... PUT ASIDE SOME FOOD. I'LL LEAVE AFTER A TIME. GO TO THE GIRL. DON'T SIT HERE SO. THE CLAN WILL WONDER. STOP. GIRL, WHY DO YOU STAY IN THE ONE PLACE LOOKING TO THE RIVER? IS THERE A WORD AGAINST IT? WELL, I ONLY ASKED. HERE! HERE! HERE. HERE. HOW MANY TIMES WILL THE LAW BE BROKEN? HOW MANY TIMES WILL A SYMBOL MAKER GO BEYOND THE RIVER TO STIR THE EVIL THERE? EVEN NOW HE CROSSES THE FORBIDDEN RIVER TO ENTER THE LAND OF THE GOD THAT KILLS WITH ITS TOUCH. [MURMURING] AND NOW HE HAS MOVED HIS FATHER TO BREAK THE LAW AGAIN AS WELL. I SAY... TAKE UP YOUR THROWING STICKS AND YOUR KNIVES AND FOLLOW THEIR STEPS TO THE RIVER AND KILL THEM ALL BEFORE WE ALL DIE FROM THE EVIL THEY WILL BRING. [SHOUTING] GO ON. GO ON! ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE FOREST. HOW CAN THE WORD BE SERVED IF WE TOO BREAK THE LAW? WE SEEK TO AID IT AND TO KEEP IT. THERE CAN'T BE NO WRONG IN THAT. WHO WILL CARE FOR THE WOMEN AND THE YOUNG IF WE MEET EVIL AND DEATH IN THAT FORBIDDEN PLACE? THE EVIL WILL COME TO ALL OF US UNLESS WE FIND THE YOUNG SYMBOL MAKER AND HIS FATHER AND KILL THEM. HE WHO MOVES FOR THE RIGHT WILL COME TO NO HARM IN THAT PLACE. MOVE BACK SLOWLY. YOU CAME TO TAKE ME BACK. AYE. AT FIRST. BUT NOW I STAY TO HELP IN YOUR PURPOSE. MOVE BACK. NO. THIS IS THE GOD THEY FEAR. DEAD, THE CLAN WILL FEAR IT NO MORE, AND THE LAW WILL BE GONE AND A NEW WAY OPENED TO US. LOOK. IT MOTIONS, AS THE MAN FROM THE BURNING PLACE. IT RISES TO ATTACK. CAST YOUR ARROW. SEE? SEE. KILL HIM NOW. LOOK. IT IS WELL. KILL HIM IN THE SIGHT OF THE GOD THAT GIVES DEATH WITH ITS TOUCH. HE DOES NOT DESIRE TO KEEP THE LAW. WHAT DO YOU DO? THIS IS NO EVIL THING. IT WAS NO EVIL THING. NOT A GOD. THE WORD TELLS HE COULD NOT BE GIVEN DEATH. IT LIES SO STILL. THE BEASTS ARE DEAD. NOW YOU TWO MUST DIE. NO. THE BEASTS ARE DEAD. THE LAW IS DEAD. THE GOD THAT GIVES DEATH WITH ITS TOUCH IS DEAD AS WELL. THE GOD? DEAD? IT'S NO GOD. A MAN. ANOTHER KIND OF MAN. ONE CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS, AND SOME WERE HERE. HERE'S A SYMBOL. THIS MUST BE THE WAY MAN SHOULD GREET MAN. HIS HANDS WITHOUT A WEAPON. WHAT SYMBOLS ARE THESE? I HAVE NONE LIKE THESE IN MY MIND. AND THESE WERE MADE IN A WAY UNKNOWN TO ME. ALL OF THIS. ARE THESE SYMBOLS, TOO? PERHAPS. SOMEDAY THEY MUST BE KNOWN. IT IS A THING OF WONDER. SHALL WE TAKE HIM TO THE CAVE AND MAKE A CAIRN FOR HIM? LEAVE HIM IN THIS PLACE THAT WAS HIS. THE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN A NEW LAW IS MADE. FOOD WILL BE GATHERED. WHEEL THINGS MADE. AND THE CLAN WILL SEEK OUT OTHER MEN IN OTHER PLACES. WE WILL TAKE THIS THING OF WONDER. SOMEWHERE MAN MAY BE ABLE TO TELL US THE WORDS OF THE SYMBOLS. OR ONE OF US MAY FIND A WAY TO KNOW. AYE. SO LET THIS MAN STAY. HE WILL NOT BE ALONE. Man: I AND A PARTY OF 23 OTHERS WERE ON A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION WHEN THE BOMBS BEGAN TO FALL. THE TERRIBLE POWER OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS UNLEASHED ALL OVER THE WORLD. RETALIATION ADDED TO RETALIATION UNTIL ALL TRACES OF MAN'S WORKS HAD BEEN WIPED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. OF THE FEW LIVING THINGS THAT ESCAPED THE BLAST, SOME GREW HUGE BEYOND ALL REASON AND FORMED AS THE DINOSAURS OF PREHISTORY, WHERE IT TOOK ON NEW SHAPES ALTOGETHER, MAD IN SHAPE AND PURPOSE. MY COMRADES AND I, HALF PROTECTED BY OUR RADIATION SUITS, FOUND OURSELVES GIVEN AN AGE FAR BEYOND THE SPAN ALLOWED. OUT OF ALL THE SPRAWLING MILLIONS OF THE EARTH, A HANDFUL ESCAPED UNHARMED THROUGH FORTUNE OR DESIGN. AFTER THE HOLOCAUST, THE WISEST OF THEM SET DOWN A LONG LIST OF TABOOS. THE LAWS ARE IN THE FORM OF A RELIGION NOW. IT'S STRANGE TO SEE THEM LIVING THE LIFE OF CRO-MAGNON MAN AND NOT KNOWING WHY. ON OCCASION, WE TRY TO CONTACT THEM, BUT THEY FEARED US. AND OUR RADIATION KILLED THOSE WHO CAME TOO CLOSE. NOW ONLY I'M LEFT, AND THE RADIATION HAS WORN AWAY THESE LONG, LONG YEARS. NOW A NEW ONE THINKS AND WONDERS ABOUT THE TRUTH OF THE LAW. PERHAPS MAN WILL DARE TO TRY AGAIN. I AM VERY LONELY, VERY, VERY TIRED. Narrator: THIS HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO. AND AS YOU KNOW, MEN DID MEET OTHER MEN. AND FIRE-SMELTED METAL MADE EXPLOSIVES. THE WHEEL TURNED MACHINES AND MADE GUN BARRELS. THE TOWERS WERE BUILT AND FLATTENED. HOW MANY TIMES WILL IT HAPPEN AGAIN? AND IF IT DOES, WILL ANY AT ALL SURVIVE THE NEXT TIME? OR WILL IT BE THE END?
