Whoa! What's your problem? - Are you drunk? - No, I'm not drunk! Oh, you're just out here watching your schoolyard crush? Dylan, you look ridiculous! Good neighbors here. Just go inside. - Don't track water in my house. - Right. Clean up your room. Company coming over. Hey, dinner with Reverend Charles tonight at 7:00. Okay? Don't forget. I kinda already have plans for tonight. Well, you're kinda gonna have to break you plans. It's my house, my rules. If you don't like, you'll be 18 soon, and you could leave. - Why you gotta be like that? - Why do you have an attitude all the time? Look, just... change. Dress nicer. You don't always have to look so homeless. Hmm. Okay. Dude, are you serious? Having some people over tonight, if you're interested. I can't. I got this... This dinner thing with my mom. What? Fine, suit yourself. She's tryin' to impress some guy that she's been dating. Impress? Your mom's hot as fuck. Why would she even want you there? I don't know. I guess to pretend that we're a halfway decent family. - Mmm-hmm. - The dude's like a reverend or something. - A reverend? - Yeah. Your mom and a reverend? It's like sacrilegious. I guess that she thinks it's the quickest way to get good with God. It kind of is. Mmm. - Dorothy, you have truly outdone yourself. - Oh. And I'm not just talking about the dinner either. Charles. Dylan, your mother tells me you'll be graduating soon. Yeah, in about a week. Very good, son. So you'll be looking for a place of your own pretty soon. Actually, we started looking at colleges for Dylan. - We have? - Yeah, we have. Oh. Weren't you expelled from two other schools? I left those schools... by choice. Yeah, he wasn't a good fit. Then I'm sure you have plenty of other options lined up. May I be excused? No, we're in the middle of dinner. Please, I have somewhere I need to be. Where do you have to go, to get drunk with Nick? - I don't drink. - Right. He doesn't drink, but he was passed out drunk on the back lawn this morning, because he doesn't drink. It told you, it... It was a nice night. I just thought I would enjoy it. I fell asleep. That is such a dumb excuse, son. Hey, stop calling me "Son." You don't know me. And you watch your tone with me, young man. You know, when I was your age, I was a man. I wasn't leeching of my mama. But you don't have a problem leeching off of mine? Sit down. Sit down! Dylan. You wanna know why I don't drink? Oh, yeah. Please enlighten us. Shall I describe my childhood to you? I mean, you were there... but maybe you just don't remember. You know, you've got a real attitude problem. What can I say? Things weren't always roses at home. You wanna go? Get out. Get out! Shit. Dylan... I'm so sorry, Charles. Hey, I'll see you guys inside, right? Tex, you thinking of getting out after graduating this year? Hey, Tex. I ain't in no rush. Hey, third time's a charm, right? - You want a beer? - No, no, no. I don't... All right, yeah. Fuck it. Attaboy, Dylan. - I'll see you around. - All right. Where were we? Excuse me. Hey, yo, what's up, Nick? Yo! Look who decided to show. Yeah, man, my schedule freed up. Hey. Hey! How was the reverend? I don't wanna talk about that right now, actually. - Okay. - Hey, Dylan. Yo, Dylan! But I will be back. Excuse me. Hey, what's up, Monty? - He's always a little weird. - I need shots. - You want shots? - Yeah. My God. Shots! Fuck yeah, I love to party! It's been a while. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. You gonna stick around for a while at the party? I don't know yet. Don't leave without saying goodbye, all right? I have something to tell you. What is wrong with you? That's Sara Holland, man. I know who it is, Monty. Are we still on for ball tomorrow? Don't tell Nick how it is. - Yeah, man, I got you. - All right. So you're drinking now. Still only my second. Maybe... my third. Mmm-hmm. I always thought it was kinda cool that you didn't drink. I just felt like it. What's it to you? Nothing. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. It was yesterday, wasn't it? Yeah. Three years. And I guess that me... ...and my mom have different ways of dealing with that. Gosh, I'm so sorry. No. No, it's okay. I mean... it has nothing to do with you, so... Yeah, it does. Dylan, you're... my friend. You're my oldest and best friend. And... I'm gonna miss you so much ...next year. But... I might have something to make you feel better. And what would that be? - Come on. - Really? Yeah, I'm serious. - Come on. - All right. Gosh, we were so little when we came up with that. She's trash. Yeah, she'll be gone, too. - Sara. - Good.

Uh, you know what? Lemme think about that. I'll be in my office. You need to think about school, and ain't like those punks around town. Don't worry about me. I've got my whole future planned out. Yes, so did I. Come on, come on, come on. You're pretty good, kid. Obviously not good enough. Hmm. I have not seen one of these in years. Yeah? Lemme stand up and tell them. Is that right? Huh. Is this what you, uh, do for kicks... around here? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah? - Well... don't go dying. - What? The game. Don't die. See you around. - Rough night? - Screw you, Casey. Looks like you're the one getting screwed tonight. - No. No! - Mmm. Oh, God. Don't go there. Hello? - Oh, my God. - That's every scary movie. - What's up, kids? - Uh, hey... Hey, officers. - What's up? - Just seeing who's doing what. Yeah. Yeah... Um, but we didn't have a party. We just had some people over earlier. Really? Dad's out of town again, huh? Mmm. When isn't he? Tex, I thought we got you - on drunk and disorderly last week. - Uh-huh. What're you doing here? Well, I mean, you know, Officers, it's graduation week. Judge just let me slide. Gee, you guys must be so bored comin' all the way out here. You have no idea. Okay, then, um... Hey! Uh, why don't I... For the road. - Why, thank you, Nick. - See you next week. - Graduation party. - Be safe. See you next week. You're a real piece of work, you know that? What'd I miss? I think they're... I think they're aliens. - What? - Yeah. No. Why are there always aliens? ♪ You don't know how it feels ♪ To be me ♪ Oh, baby you don't know how it feels ♪ To be me Okay. Shit! Guys! Guys, help! What... What you got there, man? I found her on the street. Can you put her back? Really, Sara? Shit. Come on. Come on. Hmm. What's this? Video kid. This his? How would I know? All these punks come in here. I'll ask you again. Is it his? Rahem. I don't know. He likes this stuff. Would you be so kind as to point me in his direction, Rahem? I don't know where he is. He comes in, he plays his game, and then he leaves, I swear. Rahem, I don't like to repeat myself. I, uh... Uh... Rahem. Come on, Rahem. Rahem. Come on, Rahem. Come on. Come on, Rahem. Why do you keep saying my name so much? Oh, they won't protect you. They just show you what happened. Rahem... Rahem... Sheesh, she looks just like... - Just like... - Is that... Is that her? I... I don't know who she is. No way. She's all torn up. Just look at her. Yeah, she looks pretty rough. What... What are you doing? Nothing. Nothing. Dylan found you on the street. You found me on the street? Why did you bring me here? My phone died, and this was the closest house. I mean, you were pretty beat-up, so I just... Who the fuck are you? I was in an accident, I think. Yeah, that's fine. We're gonna call 911 now, right? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll call 911. No, no, no, no. Don't... Don't call the cops. I can't have them... I... Are you in trouble with the law? Because none of us have seen you around here before. No, no, no. I... I crashed my car. Please don't tell anyone. I don't wanna be in trouble with the cops. Okay. Okay, we won't say anything. Just stay calm, all right? I promise you're safe. Someone's obviously off their fuckin' meds. I'm outta here. Okay. Um... are you hurt? What about a hospital? I'm... I'm fine. I'm just tired. Can I... Can I just stay here for a bit? I... I'll call someone to pick me up, I promise. Okay. Hey, guys, could you please leave? Give her some space? This is my room. Uh, no. Really? Out. All of this was interesting for a little bit... - but now, it's just kinda sad and boring. - Yeah. Thanks, guys. Hey. Hey. It's okay. I'm gonna grab some stuff to clean you up, okay? You're gonna be fine. Promise. I'll be right back. Hey. Thanks for helping me out. Yeah, I mean, you tackled me off my board. I didn't really have a choice. My name's Dylan. I owe you one. No. No, no, you don't owe me. It was just the right thing to do. This might sting a little. Has anyone ever told you you look like Bebe A. Love? - Whoo. - Oh. Well, now! That's a hell of a shame. - Well, this thing was goin' pretty fast, huh? - Mmm. Tennessee plates. Davidson County. It's out of Nashville. Pretty nice car to be all the way up here. It's probably stolen, I'm guessing. - That's what I think. - Jesus Christ! Put your hands on your head, sir. Uh... What did I do, officers? You're out here creepin' in the dark. That's what. Well, the vehicle is out here in the dark. What now? You asked why I'm creepin' around in the dark. Well, I can't help it. It's just dark. Sir, do you know who owns this car? Oh, no, I can't reveal that. Privacy reasons, I'm sure you understand. What are you, some type of a dick? More of a security detail. My name is Anton. "Anton"? Look, if we walk over to my car, I can call my boss and see if I can share the client's name. Simple. My phones are in the car. Let's give him a shot. Oh. Oh! Mmm. Right. Yes, yes. I see. Okay. Okay, guys... this is a very complicated and delicate matter. The person that we are looking for is actually quite famous. Famous? Around here? World-famous and passing through. The reason I've been trying to be so discreet about this... Well, she's not doing so well. You know, I'm... I'm still not following you. You're... You're saying that this famous person was the one behind the wheel? The past couple of weeks she's been a few Xanaxes shy of shaving her head and attacking someone with an umbrella. Do you know what I mean? She's not well. Well, I look out for her. I'm a handler of sorts. Well, the suspense is killing me. You gonna tell us who she is, or what... What the fuck was that? Honestly, you don't wanna know. Open the fuckin' trunk. I can assure you that is the last thing that you want to happen. Open the fuckin' trunk now! - Slowly. - Just tryin' to help. Go. Oh. Lord Almighty. Jeb. Jeb. Now, down on the fucking ground. Nobody ever listens anymore. So, let me get this straight. You were riding your board, and this random chick just jumped at you? Yeah, man. I don't know where she came from. - It was random. - And you didn't see anything else? - Like another car or a person? - No. Nothing. It was clear. So weird, man. This is so lame. Let's just call the cops and let them figure it out. Just give her a minute, okay? She's scared. Guys, I... I think it's her. I don't know. I... I mean, I do. Oh, please. That's ridiculous. What would anybody famous be doing here anyway? It's fun to think about it, - but come on, guys. - Okay, calm down. Calm down. She's definitely just a crackhead that just looks like Bebe. And now that she's in my bed, can we please do something about it? Look, I don't mind helping anybody. I really don't. But, uh, I got a scholarship come fall. Now, I can't be getting mixed up in anything weird. Okay. Look, whoever she is, she... She got in an accident. Okay. That's it. That's all. Damn it. Look, man, I'm fine with whatever you wanna do. But we gotta do something. I don't care who she looks like. Yeah, you're right. - Whoa! - Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. This place is a mess. Can we clean up? - Yeah, yeah, I guess... - Yeah. Yeah. Fuck this. What the hell? 911. What's your emergency? Hey, I'm at 515 Terry Street, and we found someone who was in an accident. Can you send he... - Piece of shit. - Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Stop it. Why did you just do that? She is not our problem. Well then, why don't you just leave? I don't have a car and you know that. Well, Tex is sober by now. So go with him. Fuck you, Nick. Car 29, we have a 911 for 55 Terry Street. I believe that's the Hill's Residence. They said they found a car accident victim. Well, copy that. We are on our way. Sorry. No, it's okay. I just... I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. Appreciate that. Do you need anything? Water, or... Okay. Are you from around here or... something? Uh, it's just a few hours away. Nashville, right? What? Th... The show tonight. Casey's right. - No. You have me mixed up with... - No. No. No, it is you. Shit. You're Bebe A. Love. I... I love your music. I... I mean, I really listen to you. I love you. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean that. I just... Dylan, please... You... You can't say anything. Not even to your friends. No one can know that I'm here. If the media found out... Please promise me. No one. Bebe A. Love. Yeah... I don't understand why you're here. I don't know. Uh, when I got done with my show... I saw this car with keys in it, and... I took it. I started driving. Away from it all. I have never driven a car in my entire life. I guess, I just needed to get away. Nick's... Nick's dad is gonna be away for a while, so... If... If you want, you can stay. No, I'll... call my lawyer and take care of it. There are people who are angry at me. And looking for me. Dylan... no one can know that I'm here. Hey, uh, um... Yo, Dylan, can I, um... Can I talk to you for a minute? Like, now. Please. Okay, look, um, I'll come back. Just... You should get some rest. Sara called the cops, man. She's freaking out about everything. Fuck. Okay, maybe we can find a way to make them go away. Maybe she's right. Maybe we should call the cops. Hey. Who's that? I don't know. C... Can I help you? You can help me. Uh, okay. Okay. Where's Officers Roberts and Mills? As you can see, they've escorted me here. I'll be handling the situation. Okay, well, you wouldn't mind if I spoke to them? I do mind, actually. I'm really in quite a rush. You give off such a creepy vibe. Just an FYI. Why, thank you. Now, you seem like somewhat of a smart guy. I bet you know why I'm here. Do you have a badge? Or a name or something that I can see? If you could just bring her down, that would be swell. The crackhead? - You want the... The crackhead? - Crackhead. Crackhead. That's funny. Hey, there you are. How about that? I've been looking for you. The video kid. Come here. What'd you want with her? Oh, looks like someone's in the know. You. Beat it. Back off, okay. Shoo! Beat it. Deal with it. Your name? Uh, Dylan. Dylan. Dylan. Well, Dylan, it's not very hard to see how this all played out. And I understand that you're just trying to do right by her. But she is a sick girl. And needs help. Think about it, Dylan. Running around out there, crying for help. Doesn't take much to see that she is not well. And who are you? Well, we haven't properly met. I'm Anton. Would you invite me in? It'd be easy if you said yes. You are not safe... with her in there. None of you. None of you. And I can't be held responsible for her actions. Now, I truly prefer not to have to walk in here and physically drag her out. So, Dylan, my man... Dylan, if you could just calmly talk her down to me, and I can take it from here, and everything will be so simple, Dylan. Do it, Dylan. Do it. Don't shut me out! Don't shut me out! What was that? I don't know. - Wind. Was it the wind? - Yeah, it's totally wind. Don't shut me out! Damn it! Don't shut me out! Are you ready for a show? Are you ready for the show? Behind door number one... is... Come here, dead buddy. And number two. Are you enjoying the show, everyone? Good. Ah! I need to get out of here, now. Sara, Sara, come here. Calm down. - This can't be real, right? - This looks pretty fucking real to me, Nick! Come on! Come on! God damn it! - Dylan! - Everybody, lock everything, now! There's a man outside looking for you. He says he's your manager or something. He just killed two cops. He's here. If he's the man outside, then yeah, he's here. You need to tell me what's going on. He came back for me. He is coming for me. I'm not going back! Back? Where? This was no good either. Fuck. Guys, we're just sitting ducks. We can't just stay here. Yeah, well, it looks like he's not trying to break in. He's just circling the house like a shark. We have to get out. Get out. Get out. God damn it, it's a no brainer, y'all. We go up there, grab her, toss her ass out of here. - Yeah, why don't we give him what he wants. - Yeah. Get out! Please, get out! Get out! What is going on? It's not an earthquake, is it? No, the floors ain't moving, man. - Sara! Sara! - Wait, wait! Don't, don't, don't! If she wants to go, that's on her, but it's not safe outside. - Come back! - No, stop! Sara! We can't get through to anybody. The phones aren't working. All right. Okay, okay. Guys, guys, what... What do we do? Nick, do you have any guns? Uh, yeah, yeah, I got a gun, it's in the safe. But I don't know what the fucking code is. Oh, my God. Dylan, what did you bring to my house, man? She needed my help, man. Well, this is on you. So fix it. - Dude. - Nick, it's not his fault. - Fuck! - God! I'm sorry, Dylan. Listen, some weird shit is going on. I'm freaking out, too. Look... I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Please. Oh. Look, I'm sorry, but... Please. You can't send me out there. And I... I can't... You don't know what it's like. Look, I have to look out for my friends. Okay? That guy out there killed people that we know. And with everything that's going on in the house, it's... Look... Please don't get angry. I don't want you to get angry, but... you have to leave. Please. Truth is... I don't know... what I am. There, there, now. No reason to be afraid. I, too, was just taking a little breather from the hustle and bustle. Sit. Go on. I'm sorry. For what? You... didn't do anything. Please don't hurt me. That's not my style. Uh, I have no reason to hurt you. In fact, I... kind of admire you. Why? Because you believe in self first. Not much else... matters. Would you do me a favor? I need you to come closer. It's a secret, don't be afraid. Yes. Yes, now. Fuck this waiting around. We should make a run for it. No, no, don't be stupid. All he wants is the girl. Dylan's gonna talk her down, we're gonna push her right out the door, and nobody has to get hurt. Okay. But, God, how do you explain the falling glass, - and the slamming doors... - Can we just deal with one thing at a time? - Let me in. - What happened? Guys, I think he's gone. - Okay, guys, if he's gone, we have to make a run for it. - No, no, no, no, no. - Okay. I'm so sick of these games. - No, no, no, no, wait. It could be a trap. Like, let her come back, tell us that everything's okay. Let's just wait for Dylan. I don't know. Ever since I was a little girl... stuff just happened around me. Stuff that I can't explain. You don't know about the guy outside? Anton? Why doesn't he just come inside and get you? He's just... I... I don't know. I don't know. I... I think he is afraid of me or something. There are rules. It's a business. One they would murder for. They? My handlers. My father. Where the hell is Dylan? Just give him a minute, Nick. Dylan. Are you scared of me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm petrified. I'm not gonna hurt you. Hey, hey, hey! It's just me. It's just me. I don't like this shit, dude. Nick, do you think that he cut the power? Will you stop asking me questions like I fucking know the answer, Tex? I'm just as scared as you are. There is a back-up generator underneath the house. What if he breaks in when you are gone? Don't you think he would have broken in by now? He's just screwing with us. I'll be right back. - Wait. - I'm coming with you. Guys. Be careful, please. - I... I should go check on them. - No, no, don't go. I... I've never been on my own before. I don't know what to do. You just stay up here. - Okay, I'll be right back. - I'm sorry... that I got you involved in this. You do believe me, don't you, Dylan? Do I have a choice? She's such a bitch. I came back for you guys. Such a bitch. - Hey. - Hey. Where were you? Just trying to figure all this out. Did you make her leave? Dylan. Jesus! It's okay. There's a lot of critters down here. I hate critters. Oh, shit. There it is. Okay. Um... - Check the gas. - I'm trying to. Where are they? They should've made it back by now. Monty. How come you never made a move on me? What? I said, how come you never made a move on me? It's kind of a strange time to have a conversation like this, don't you think? Look, I'm just trying to keep my mind off things. I'm really scared. Well, I'm scared, too. I mean, yeah, I've... I've definitely thought about you. You're beautiful. You really wanna get our mind off things? What do you mean? I just want all this to be over with. Good work. I like it. Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - What happened? - I... I just walked in. - Monty, please, come on. - Come on, Monty. - I was in the bathroom. - Who did this? - How the fuck should I know? Because you have blood all over you. I was trying to help him, just like you. It must have been him. No! No! How did this happen? We don't know. We just found him like this. I'm gonna kill that motherfucker! Was everything locked? Yeah, yeah. I... I think so. Well, if everything's locked, how the fuck did he get in? I can't take this anymore! - She's gone. - Whoa, whoa, big guy. This is messed up, but I was just with her upstairs. She didn't do this. I don't care, Dylan. Move! Please, Tex, stop! Please, Tex! Stop! Stop! Okay, let's just think about this for a minute! It's fucking her! Okay, it's her. It's Bebe A. Love. What? - I know, I should've told you guys... - That's bullshit. - He's lying. - Why would I? It's fucking her! Why wouldn't you tell us that? Do you realize what insane shit we're in now? Because I promised her. We're your fucking friends, Dylan. When... When shit was bad for you, we... We... get it. - You know what, I don't give a shit. - Tex. - Tex. Tex, stop. - Who or what she is, okay? We're past that, Dylan! - Get out of my way! - Tex. - Wait, guys! Guys! - Tex! Tex, stop! Tex, no! Whose side are you on? Just calm down! Bebe, open the door. Bebe, please! - Tex! Tex, you okay, man? - Yeah, he's okay. - Dylan, come out here. - I can't. The door is locked. Hold on, Dylan. I'm gonna get something to pry open the door with. Damn it! Shit. Oh, fuck! Bebe. Bebe. Sweetie. Let's go home. Enough is enough. It's only a matter of time before they start to turn on you. Please. Let's go home. Oh, God. Oh, God, come on. Get off. What are you doing in here? I have to wash the blood off, too. Why couldn't you just use the other bathroom? It's the same blood. I thought we should wash it off together. - You okay, Sara? - Why? Don't I look okay? I'm so sorry to wake you. I didn't think it would come this far. She's awakening, I fear. That's why I don't wanna go in there, but you... Please. For me. Let's bring her home. They don't realize what we have, darling. Okay, just back the fuck up. You've never liked me... have you, Casey? I'm done. Help! Hang on! I'm coming! Sara, what are you doing? I form the light and create darkness. I make peace and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things. I always said she was trash. Damn it! Bebe. Fuck. Shit. Tex. Tex, Tex, Tex! Okay, stay with me. Stay with me. Fuck! Okay. Fuck! - Dylan? - Help me get him to the bathroom. Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Hey, hey, hey! All right. Oh, my God! - Come on. - Oh, my God! I don't know what to do. What do I do? Shit! Tex! Tex! Tex. Hey. Hey. Where is Dylan? Go, go, go! Fuck. I thought you said you didn't know the code. Do you have a better idea? I'm all ears. Okay, just hurry! Uh, Dad's birthday is... Seventh... Seventh... Shit. Uh, Mom's birthday is... Fuck! Uh... - Yeah, I got it. - Come on, come on! All right. All right. - She's gone. - You think so? Yeah, I do. Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? I have to make sure. Yeah, she's gone. - Dylan? - What the fuck? I'm so sorry, man. I didn't know it was you. - I thought you were her. - You have a gun? - Yeah. Yeah, I got it from the safe. I... - Uh... Where did she go? Dylan? Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! - What are you doing? - Nick. We have a gun now, Dylan. This is our best chance to get out of here alive. - Without her. - She needs my help. Well, then you don't have ours, Dylan. - Come on. - Wait, wait, wait. - Dylan. Dylan... Wait. Dylan! - The sun is coming up. This is our best chance. Okay, let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are we stopping? Okay, we're supposed to go that way, I think. Wait, didn't we just come from that way? No, we came from back there. I think. You think? God, I thought you said you knew the woods like the back of your hand. Can we please just go my way? What? We were going straight, right? How the fuck did we end up back here? I'm gonna go find Dylan. Okay, I can't... I can't leave him. - No, don't. - I'm sorry. Don't... Don't fucking dare... Shit! Dylan? It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Hey, where's Nick? Uh, right outside, in the woods. We got all turned around. Hey, he does that to you, I know. Whoa! - Nick! - Dylan. Where did you go, man? She ran off on me, and I wasn't too excited about being stuck back in the house. Okay, did you see him? Where is he? No, um... I don't know, dude. Um... Yeah, I think he's out the front. We tried to get out, but we just ended up back here. Okay, look, so we can't... - go where the car is, but... Maybe... - I was just out the front. What? I was talking about how I... Whoa! - Nick, stop. Look, Nick... - I create the light and form the darkness. - Nick, stop. - I make peace and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things. Nick, put the gun down! Stop, Nick. This isn't you! Stop! Nick, stop! Hey. What the fuck is wrong with this guy? It's his game. He wants you to go crazy. He'd rather see you suffer than simply kill you. He's enjoying every second of this. It's like he gets off on it. I could shoot him. Right now. I could end this. No. You can't. Let's go to the woods. We already tried that. I think it might be different with her. Casey. I'm gonna run with Bebe. Okay, he's gonna chase us, and once you see that the coast is clear, you run as fast as you can. Okay? And stay on the main road, so that you don't get turned around again. - Okay? - Okay. I promise that I'll come visit you. Promise? I promise. It's better to just hide here than run off in the other direction. Why are you doing this for me? Because you're different. Like, very different, but that doesn't mean you have to be a prisoner. Fuck! Hey! Hey! Help! Help! Help! Help me, please. - Are you okay? - Can you please take me to the police? Of course. Get in. What happened to you? They're dead. They're all dead. You're safe now, little lady. I didn't tell you this earlier, but you're the first boy I kissed. I wanna share something with you. I didn't know I could feel like this. Here we go. Come on, Dylan. Come on. Let's go. Well, you've made quite the impression on my little Bebe. She came running back to me, begging for your life. It was quite spectacular, actually. Well done. I don't want any more funny business from you. Understood? Have a seat. I'm sorry about your friends. At least one of them made it. Hopefully, she... She did. So you're him? Shit. No, I'm the babysitter. It's a shit job, I tell you. Babysitter? That is his daughter. Well, he's not really a he, or a she. More like an it. I don't understand. Why didn't you just barge in and take her? I mean, why all this? Hmm? Why my friends? Well, your friends... That was just business. She's a lion born in captivity. Bred to do one thing only. To perform. But, like any lion born in the circus, she doesn't know her own strength, what she's capable of. I am the lion tamer, Dylan. It's my job to keep her blind and in line. But like any good lion tamer will tell you, your lion will undoubtedly... discover its natural instincts, and when it gets spooked, you don't want to be trapped in a cage with it. Stand up. Come on. Stand up. You seem like a good guy. And I've agreed not to kill you, but I gotta leave you with something. Stop! Get back in the car! I promise you'll never be alone. You'll see. You're the daughter of Darkness. Now you go off and fall in love? This is so pathetic. Back in the car. Well, we're off to her next concert. Have to spread the good word to all the little teeny boppers around the world. Well, you know what I mean. Dylan. - Jesus Christ! - How did I get here? Are you... Are you kidding me? After all that crap you gave me last night with Charles, you're gonna ask me, "How did I get here?" Are you for real? Come on. Look at you, look at your face. What's going on with you? Dylan! A mass suicide in an occult ritual by this group of teens. We'll keep you posted on this tragedy... - Fuck! - ...as details continue to emerge. We have to catch our plane in two hours. Next show is Chicago, tomorrow night. Listen to me. This is over. I kept my promise, but I swear, you try this stunt again... he will die a very horrific death. Do you want to try me? I'll be just fine. I know what I'm doing. Fuck! Shit. Shit! Dylan? I need to talk to you, son. Dylan, you were over at Nick's. You need to tell me what happened. And remember, I am a man of God. What did I say about calling me son? Quit with all the nonsense and tell me what happened. Where do you want me to begin? Sweet Jesus!
