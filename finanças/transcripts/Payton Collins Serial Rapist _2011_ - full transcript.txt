(dramatic music) (loud moaning) (suspenseful music) (loud moaning) - I'm Major Constantine Jones, profiler with the FBI. I'd like to ask you a few questions sir. - Like what? - Where did you grow up? What were your parents like? Start in the beginning. - My father. - His father and I use to fight right in front of him. - Housewife mother. - And his dad was abusive and he use to use his fist as a weapon and on me too. - By the age of 10, we lived in about seven states. We moved around a lot. I didn't have any friends. Didn't want 'em. I was a loner. - I see. Want some coffee, tea, a coke? - I'm good. - Good, good. I'm ready to roll sir. Can I call you Payton? - Payton was a very quiet kid, polite and courteous. So you can imagine how shocked I was when two FBI agents showed up at my front door telling me that my son was a homosexual rapist. First I knew very little what a homosexual was and then a homosexual rapist. It was something I couldn't even imagine. I didn't know that there was anything like that. And now, it was my son. - [Michael] Payton Collins was really a meek, nerdy little teenager, not terribly attractive. By the time he graduated from high school, he managed to make only one friend, the school's librarian, who later on vanished without a trace. Then there were a string of girlfriends. The most notable one, a rocker chick from Joliet named Matilda Moon. An engagement followed, and he get married to someone else. Preacher's daughter from Texas. For awhile, life was good. They both settled into some kind of normality. When found out about the men, a divorce was soon to follow. However, he always stayed in touch with Ms. Moon. - Believe me, I know him. We were together off and on for like a year. More off then on. But he always called, mostly asking for money. The Spanish ladies, they knew me quite well. Yeah, I was his ATM if you will (chuckles). - Well, the best way I could put it is that something with Payton Collins went very, very wrong. By his late teens, he made a turn into a much darker place. The sexual fantasies started to become more intense and he seemed dazed and confused by all accounts. - Once Payton got into high school, I noticed a change. It was about the ninth or 10th grade. He was retreating into his own world. And by the time he was a senior, he became very withdrawn. He wouldn't hear a word I said. He'd just gaze out for hours and hours sitting on that damn chair. - Could have been an act. Who knows? With Payton, a wild guess is just about the best you can do. Two psychopaths with a twist. - [Matilda] Payton was extremely narcissistic. He would stare you right in the eye and lie through his teeth. I'm not that stupid, I knew what was going on. We needed money. So he started stripping for the local shutter bugs. Cockroaches is more like it. Anyway, that's when he really seemed to come into his own. His confidence seemed to be on the rise and his whole look changed. - Did you engage in sexual activity with those photographers? - Some helped themselves to my dick between the shots. I didn't mind. Some were good at what they did. - This isn't so bad. Lots of guys pose for pictures and don't go any further. What happened with you that was so different? - [Matilda] Payton had a lot of personal charm, sort of swept you off your feet until you pissed him off. Then another persona came out. When he'd give you that look, it was spine chilling. Sort of give you the creeps. But then he'll come right back warning you in like the nicest way possible. Never had to do this or say what you said again. And then he'll sort of look at you and study to measure how uncomfortable he made you. - Unfortunately, I never sat down and discussed it with Payton. That's too hard, I don't know how to do that kind of thing. My parents never sat me down and had any kind of a heart to heart. - [Matilda] The thing that always shocked me about Payton was that innocent face, like always running a smile. And then that filth came at you from that sweet face. Kind of took you back. - When did you actually start photographing your own guys your self? - [Payton] When I turned 21. - Well, we're in the college era now. Let's get into it. - [Payton] I did use college as excuse to procure guys. The first one was a navy guy on an AWOL. I knew him from the neighborhood. I liked shooting people I knew personally. They trusted me and I could much further. I oiled him up to make him more relaxed. It didn't seem to really work. (suspenseful music) (camera snapping) I would sit down and look at those for hours and hours. (suspenseful music) - So how many guys were there in that college year? - Three. - Let's go one by one. Well, let's start with the next guy. - [Payton] There was a student from Nepal, a friend of the navy dude, pretty boy type. He was very cooperative. - And how did that feel to you? - Wicked. (guitar music) - Anything else? - [Payton] Yeah, a lot. I got to look at that guy's dick from a close. (guitar music) I'm a real voyeur you know. - I wouldn't have known. - Sarcasm? - Just making light. - I'm not in the mood. - Sorry. What were you thinking when you were looking, like you said, being a voyeur? - I wasn't thinking, I was kind of mesmerized. - That's the toughest part of this job, putting yourself inside the mind of a monster. You gotta understand how these guys think. - Like being under a spell. - [Constantine] And then? - Then I looked at that thing from every possible angle. Up and down, over and out, sideways. As I was trying to understand what it is about it that makes people want to go through such extremes for it. Even die for it. You might as well say I was consuming it with my eyes. (suspenseful music) He was very accommodating. Let me touch him indiscriminately wherever I wanted. Then I worked with both together. They use to come by and hangout often. Smoke a joint and having fun taking pictures, until. - Until? - [Payton] Until they didn't. - I see. Care to elaborate? - No. Can I have an attorney? - Sure, in time, but not yet. Who was next? - [Payton] The quarterback from the school I use to go to. (camera snapping) Everything seemed to be going fine. They all do until-- - Yes until? - Until they get upset. - Upset about what? - [Payton] Upset about sex. Bunch of wimps. Just can't be happy. - Then what? - Then I slipped through the cracks. I got a teaching position at some school. Small school in bum fuck Illinois. - [Constantine] That's where you met that young kid, you were tutoring. He got you fired, right? - Yeah, the little bitch. - We interviewed him. Said he knew you well. - Mr. Collins was a teacher of mine. The one thing that I remembered was his demeanor. Serious, never smiled much. - What happened then? Did you make him have sex with you? - I told you, he came on to me. (suspenseful music) - Oh I'm not aware that you know, but he also kept a journal on a laptop. We confiscated it. You know that laptop with the gay flag. - [Payton] Cock sucking bitch, I should have killed him right then and there. - Why? Why didn't you kill him Payton? - I don't kill. Besides, he was too willing to do what I wanted him to. I like it when they resist. (suspenseful music) After I left my job, my nights became free. I started roaming the streets for what you might call trouble. I called it opportunity. - [Woman] You are the worst of a child. I hate you, I hate you, get out. - [Man] Oh you fucking failure, get out of here. I never want to see you again. - [Man] Payton Collins liked to prey on the desperate and the lonely. Street kids, runaways, hustlers, he'd see one roaming the streets with his luggage or bag, and he'd follow them. Usually, they were broken or hungry, so it wasn't difficult to win one over. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - [Payton] Yeah, I rented a fun little place. Decorated it kind of psychedelic. Lots of atmosphere, it was good for photos and sex. Sort of puts your head in that space. And then I started being more aggressive about the approach. (bag unzipping) (suspenseful music) - [Man] You fucking zero. You'll never amount to anything, fucking bum. - [Woman] I wish you were never born. - [Man] You fucking bum. Why don't you take your shit and get out of the house. (suspenseful music) - [Payton] Got a warm bed to sleep in. - Like any mother, I ask myself over and over again, what did I do wrong? (camera snapping) (suspenseful music) I see hundreds of other children everyday. I work with them, none seem to have any problems. (camera snapping) But I'm cursed with a son that now is a wanted rapist and maybe even a killer. (camera snapping) (suspenseful music) (camera snapping) - [Man] Often, he'll buy them something to eat. He'll invite them into his place. Which he had decorated for that purpose and have them pose before raping them or drugging them. (dramatic music) - [Payton] I was on a high, like being on a drug. The more I did it, the more I wanted it. (bass music) (bar patrons talking loudly) (glass shaking) (funk music) - Hey, what's up. Come dance with me. - I don't dance. - Yeah, well you should. Come on, come dance with me. - Scram. - You won't embarrass yourself around these people. Come on, let's go. Come on. (funk music) (ambient music) He's fucking cute. (dramatic music) - Hi. - Hello. - Ready to go? - Where are we going? - Your place. - This is a little fast. Can we just talk a little? - Talk. - There are all kinds maniacs looking for hookups. I don't mind a hookup, but I'm looking for something more long term. Someone to love. Lord, I sound like some kind of hopeless romantic. - Here, have a drink. It'll make you feel better. - Think so? I'm not much of a drinker. - Well, just finish your drink so we can go. - What did you have in mind? - Are you into fantasy? - Only if it's cologne bottled up in a fun jar. I use to work for a company in Europe designing them. - I'm into fantasy. - Do tell. What's that? - Like painting a face on my ass, each cheek has an eye. The crack is the nose and the asshole is the mouth. I'd be willing to do that. Then I'll put your tongue on ice before licking my ass. If you get bored, I'll let you suck on my cock just to get horny again. Once we get to know one another, I'd hung you upside down from the ceiling. Your face in front of my crotch sucking on my cock. I'd let you jerk off if you'd want to. Up to you. (suspenseful music) - I think I'll pass. Besides, I'm getting a better offer anyways. ♫ Poor people like me we look to the ground and carry on ♫ Like people they just carry on 'cause it's all they can do ♫ Ain't got no money to buy themselves out ♫ Of the hole in their shoes ♫ Poor people like me we look to the ground, carry on ♫ What could we do ♫ We can't help you ♫ There's no open door ♫ To live your private lure (rock music) ♫ Fortunate people don't need to be sad ♫ 'Cause their money can handle it ♫ There's no (loud banging) - I've missed you. - A million questions under my mind. - If only I wouldn't have married his father. (door locking) If only I was a bit stronger. (loud grunting) - Fuck, fuck. Please, I need to go. No, please, ah. - Fuck, come in your ass. If you let me, you'll live, understood? - Fuck, yeah, yeah. - Good. - Sexually, it was all one sided. Every time we had a relation, it was like rape. (dramatic music) - Have fun, you're next in line. - [Bill] It was about 1:30 in the morning, I remember it well. I just got into the station and we got a call from a club on Halsted Street. Listen to that 911 call. - [Man] This is Shielded Nigh Club. One of our customers was sexually assaulted here. - [Man] Is he okay. - [Man] We need an ambulance. - [Man] Where are you? - [Man] 3457 North Halsted (mumbles). - [Man] (Mumbles), we're sending someone right away. Is the assailant still there? - [Man] No, no he left. He left in a hurry right afterwards. - [Man] Can you describe him? His weight, height, age, and what he was wearing. - The description we got fit Payton to a T. We knew him from other incidents in the past and well, this time, we wanted to make sure we got enough on him to put him away. (siren ringing) (dramatic music) - [Payton] When I realized the cops were after my ass, I had to disappear. - Yeah (laughs). - [Payton] So I checked out an all night restaurant and had a very long dinner. (funk music) After checking my cashflow, I realized I was fucking broke and I knew that I had to crash at a hotel, but wasn't sure where I was gonna get the money. (funk music) - [Man] What you gonna have? - I don't know, I don't have a lot of money. - [Man] Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. - Thanks. (funk music) (siren ringing) - Did you find another job? - Like you don't know. Don't fucking treat me like I'm stupid. - I know that you know that I know. But I still have to hear you say it. It has to come out of your mouth, Payton. Now don't be rude. - I taught photography at a night school in some toilet. Every night I took the train from the south side to my pad. This is how the last few days played out. (dramatic music) - Excuse me, sir, we're closing up the building. The building is closed. You need to get out of here in five minutes so I can turn the security on. - Okay. (dramatic music) (camera snapping) (dramatic orchestral music) (camera snapping) I can make the last hour of your life the most exciting. How about it mister janitor? (camera snapping) (dramatic music) Give up that lousy existence for one killer hour. Go for it you fucking loser. It's worth it. (dramatic music) (camera snapping) Five more minutes. (door closing) (bucket rolling) (dramatic music) (keys rattling) (dramatic music) (loud clicking) - Excuse me, can I use your washroom? - Yeah sure, go ahead. (keys rattling) (dramatic music) (loud urinating) (dramatic music) (guitar music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (guitar music) Come. (wood creaking) (dramatic music) I will deliver you into peace, peace of mind, peace of mind my friend, my dick is God, and God wants you. (dramatic music) Come on, you will die dancing my friend. (loud croaking) (dramatic music) (loud thumping) - Once the janitor from that night school was reported missing by his mother, we knew who it was. It was Payton. So we put together a task force. We started watching him twenty-four seven. - [Man] Immediate word (mumbles) school, located at 8914 South Buffalo. - [Payton] I needed a safe place to hide, so I called on Matilda again. - I get shit, and I'm tired of it and done with it. - [Payton] Oh Matilda, all we did was argue. She drove me crazy. Some nights I would ride the train all night long. (dramatic music) - Passenger on a train, (mumbles), said you came on to him. - So. - I'm talking about the style and manner that this was done. Not your regular run of the mill behavior. - How do you so much of this? - [Constantine] I was there. We've been following you for months. - Well, I sort of cased him, and figured him to be the more sensitive type. - Can I sit down there? - [Train Operator] Priority seating is intended for the elderly and passengers with disabilities. Your cooperation is requested. - [Payton] So I played up the romantic angle as much as I could. My thoughts were running in a completely different direction. (dramatic music) I swear, it seemed like he could almost read my mind. (dramatic music) (rock music) (loud rustling) (gasping) (loud rustling) (panting) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (dramatic music) - [Train Operator] Doors closing. Western is next. Doors open on the right at Western. (dramatic music) (keys rattling) - Where you have been, huh? Payton, you gonna fucking answer me before I go nuts? (loud thumping) - Shut your fucking hole, Matilda. - No, this fucking time, Payton. And what is this gay shit, huh? What the fuck is this, Payton? (loud smacking) I've had it with your humiliations. You know I am a person, I need respect. I'm fucking sick of this shit. You promised me that you would-- - I lied. - Waiting time is over. - You don't have to wait. I want you Matilda, I've always wanted you since the first day we met. I wanted to fuck you like you deserve. Good Catholic girl, get down on your knees and await your communion. - Oh Payton. You make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I'm so in, I want you so bad. I'm so wet already. - The party's just begun. Bitch. - What the fuck, Payton? What the fuck are you doing? No, no. What the fuck, Payton? What the fuck is the matter with you? Stop. (crying) (door closing) Dammit Payton, let me out. I fucking hate the dark. Sick fuck. Let me out of here, I'll do whatever you want. - Get dressed. (lounge music) (applause) - Hello. Are you in a bad mood? You look very familiar. You don't recognize me? Bet you'd like to get to me wouldn't you? You do find me strangely attractive don't you? It's okay, I'm bisexual-- - I want to go. - He's captivated by me. Oh, you're not leaving are you? I thought we were just getting started. It's awkward at first. - [Woman] See, you chased him away. - Couple of drinks, you'll swell right on into it. (laughing) Oh well, sometimes they're just not ready. Hi, how are you? - Why don't we go rent a gory movie or something? There's always cute boys at the video store. (siren ringing) (dramatic percussive music) (jazz music) (door squeaking) (keys rattling) (door closing) (keys rattling) Here you go. - I'm not really a big drinker. - Alright, more for me then. - Alright. - Hmm. Ah. - Look. I just want her. (dramatic music) Look, I'm not into you. I'm into her. Babe, I'm so fucking into you. - Oh yeah. - Come just touching you. I haven't been with a woman in over six months. - Why, were you in prison? - Something like that. (percussive music) Hey, enough, I said no. (loud punching) - [Matilda] Payton. Stop it. (loud cracking) Stop it. Payton, stop it. He's no good to you dead. (croaking) (handcuffs rattling) Oh my god, Payton's the best fuck ever. Oh Payton, I love you. I love you so much. - Time to shut up bitch. (door closing) Won't be long, Matilda. Play your music. - [Matilda] Payton, you son of a bitch. Let me out. Finish what you started. You said if I did this for you, you would treat me right. You cock sucking woman hater. Fuck you, Payton. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) You queer, twisted, fucking... (man grunting) Oh Lord, please help me. - What I'm telling you is there was a period of time here where this community was terrified. You could see it on the faces of people walking down the street. (jazz music) - [Payton] I knew going back to Matilda would get me busted. So I checked into a fleabag motel. (jazz music) (dramatic music) (dramatic orchestral music) (water splashing) (dramatic music) I would have loved to spend the rest of my life just raping, fucking, and violating. I would have felt like a star, that was my calling. I know it now. If only I could convince the world. Then I could run around free as a bird doing what I want. I would have made a great serial killer in Hollywood. - I can't sleep at night. - [Payton] Morning came all too soon. - I'm so easily depressed. But now I live in total darkness. (loud knocking) Who is it? Who's there? Go away or I'll call the police. - [Payton] It's Payton. - Come on in. (door closing) Can I get you something to drink? - I want something to eat. - I'll fix you something. (sighing) (dramatic music) Payton, I haven't seen you in years. Are you in trouble? - Bingo. - Figures. What did you do, Payton? I see. What are you going to do? - Can I stay here for awhile? - No, Payton, I can't do that anymore. - Then what the fuck am I going to do? - Turn yourself in. - What are you nuts? I'm staying here. - You really can't Payton. This will be the first place the police will come. Even if I said yes, they'd be here in a couple of hours, Payton. - You're probably right. I better get going then. - Here. (crying) (door closing) (funk music) - [Man] I've met a lot of criminals. What makes Payton unique was his absolute lack of scruples. The more excited he found you, the more peril you would find yourself in. Usually with most rapists or killers, it's the opposite. You ingratiate yourself with them, you might live for a few years. With him, it was the opposite. If you resisted, he find you even more exciting. And then you could count the minutes. (camera snapping) - I've had many boyfriends, but believe you me, there was only one Payton. Thank god. (jazz music) (loud knocking) - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm well. - What have you been up to? - Same old. - Are you seeing anyone? - Yeah, actually I am. - Who? - A very nice man from Kenosha. Kenosha, Wisconsin. - [Payton] I know where Kenosha is. - Payton, what are you doing here? - The heat is on my ass. Can I stay here for awhile? I need to lay low. - One day, one day and then I need you gone. - Then what? - Figure something else out. - Like what? - I don't know, Payton. It sounds like a personal problem to me. - I'm gonna lay down for awhile, then we'll talk. - Like I said, one fucking day. - We'll see. - No we won't. - Where should I lie down? - I don't give a shit, Payton. I hope you burn in hell. Goodbye, I want you gone when I get back. (door ringing) - Who's that? - Fuck you. - Whoever it is, don't fucking answer it. - It's my house. I'll be right there. - You want to fucking lose your teeth. - No. (groove music) (phone ringing) - [Woman] 911, what's your emergency. - [Woman] (Mumbles), I have something for you. - On my way to 1800 North Milwaukee, ten four. (groove music) - Bet you'd like to get to know me, wouldn't you? My prison pussy, (lips smacking). How do you like my prison pussy baby? Hmm. - [Man] Open up, police. (loud knocking) Open up, or we'll break the fucking door down. (dramatic music) Open up, police. - [Man] Early 20s, (mumbles), he came out of the (mumbles). Two or three garages in from 4100 block of (mumbles). The car tried to follow him, the subject got a little freaked out, so he started going westbound about a block and a half. (dramatic music) - [Man] Stop, on the ground, right now. - You got me. (suspenseful music) - That brings us almost up to date, doesn't it now? - When the police came and told me I could be an accessory to a crime, I had to tell them the truth. I didn't want no trouble. I just want to play my music and live by the side of the road and be a friend to man. - Let's level. We've been here talking for awhile my buddy. Tell me, why did you do it? Why did you rape and kill those poor young souls? - I didn't. - Then who did it? - They did. They did it to themselves. - And the one thing I would like to add is that I'm so sorry for the victims and for their parents. I would exchange my life in a second for theirs. I would, in a New York second, I would exchange my life. - And you do have to say after the taped interviews I did with him for hours upon hours, what becomes very clear is something that a lot of criminals have in common. Payton blames his misfortune on everybody else including his victims. Refused to take responsibility for his own actions, and that's what turns him from a common loser into a super loser. I find it amazing how many homosexuals find this type of a guy such a turn on. I guess we have the same thing in heterosexuals as well. The abused wife syndrome, women who fall for convicts. Gay people alone don't have a monopoly on low self-esteem. There's plenty of it to go around on the other side of the fence as well. Payton was smart. Probably could have been very successful in life. He made bad choices very early on. (dramatic music)
