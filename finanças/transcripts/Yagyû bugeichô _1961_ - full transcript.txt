Are they coming? They are indeed Kamiya Yu-no-jo and Princess Yu, disguised as traveling monks. Alright. In position. The Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll... They claim it to be the record of the Yagyu Shin-Kage style martial arts... ...but in reality it contains a formidable secret that could shake the world. I swear I'll hold it in these hands of mine. YAG YU CH RO N I CLES Yu-no-jo... What's wrong? Who are you? Princess Yu of the Ryuzoji Family, correct? The Ryuzoji Family that perished has no need for that thing. Let me have the scroll. Stay with me. Wait! Wait! Princess, hurry! - Yes. Get the princess! Wait! Damn it! Find it! Oh, Yu-no-jo! Princess. Yu-no-jo. It's around here somewhere. Split up and look for it. Yes. It's no use. Damn you! The Ukibune volume of the martial arts scroll, passed down in the Yagyu Shin-Kage school... ...has just fallen into the hands of Yagyu Jubei here. Please go home. Damn it! I doubt this scroll will be of any use for you folks from the Hikita Kage school. Let's avoid killing each other for nothing. Jubei, I, Yamada Fugetsusai, challenge you. Fugetsusai of the Hikita Kage school himself is present. Do you want this scroll that badly? The Ukibune volume in your hand... ...and the Suigetsu volume in possession of your father Munenori in Edo... We'll destroy them both completely, and destroy the Yagyu Shin-Kage school! That won't work. Even if you took both volumes of the scroll... ...it wouldn't mean the Shin-Kage school can be destroyed, too. It will. I assure you. If the true meaning of the scroll is exposed to the world, your school will certainly be destroyed. Do you claim to know what the scroll is about? Yeah, let's find out what it's really about right now! It's blank. Damn it! Oh, it's a fake! Princess, are you alright? Yes. But what about your wound? Just a scratch. Once they find out it's a blank scroll, they'll be after us like wolves hungry for blood. Come, Princess. Yes. The martial arts scroll hidden in your shakuhachi... ...is the last and only hope for the restoration of our family name. Princess, hold on for just a little longer. I know. Yu-no-jo, you're the only one I can depend on now. To me you are more than just a family servant. Princess! They're back. - Hurry. By any chance have you seen a lady around here? Say, a young, noble and beautiful lady. No, not at all. I see. How strange. Well, did I hear you say princess? Oh, that's not important. Wait a minute. Hey, I said wait, you hear me? What do you want? ''What do you want?'' Hey, you know what I want. What is it? What? Hey, aren't you afraid of this? I see. Damn you. Hey! I'm sorry but you're gonna have to give me your clothes and all the money you've got. Oh, that would inconvenience me, wouldn't it? That would inconvenience you? I suppose it would. But you see... Hey, hey! That doesn't set the right mood for murder! For example, you see, ''Eek, I'm scared! Oh, someone help me!'' Things like that, you know. Can you say those things? You're the princess that samurai was looking for, right? I figured that out. That being the case, I can't let you go just so easily. I see. Princess, don't hate me. Men are all the same. You ran away from your castle thinking there's some fun out here, right? So you see, that's why, I'm about to show you some fun. A noble princess... How innocent she is. I've fallen in love with you. Princess, it's not a good idea to stay at an inn tonight. Let's camp out here. Yes. Damn that bitch! I underestimated her... It was my fault, I know. Alright, I, Kyusuke the Locust, have a plan. Ouch! It hurts. Oh, there's a hot spring over there. Hmm, it could be good for cuts and bruises! Yu-no-jo! Yu-no-jo! - Yes. My clothes are gone! No, not just the clothes, the shakuhachi, too! Bastard! Who are you? - No, no, not me. What? - Not me. Welcome. Welcome. Tasaburo, how about a chat? Guess that's fine, since we happen to be traveling the same way. Say, frankly do you know anything at all about the content of the martial arts scroll? What about you? The truth is I don't. I have no idea, either. Are you after it without knowing what it's about? You're in the same boat. I'm doing it for the sake of the Yagyu Shin-Kage school. It's natural. I'm doing it so that I can destroy your school. The Suigetsu volume you keep at your home in Edo... ...and the Ukibune volume in the hands of Princess Yu of the perished Ryuzoji Family... ...put them together and I'll find a secret that'll be a damaging blow to the Yagyus. That's what Master Fugetsusai, and I, and the world believe now. The world? The Yagyu martial arts scroll isn't just any scroll... It carries a big secret. That's something everyone knows about today. It's an open secret, so to speak. The Ryuzoji princess, too, must be plotting something with the scroll. Jubei, why don't you panic a little? Tasaburo, do you want to kill me? Yes, I do. Your sword skill is the Yagyu trademark. Guess I can't win no matter how hard I try. Sheesh, you make my shuriken shiver. Well, you aren't Princess Yu. Gee, I wonder if it's trendy for women to be traveling monks these days. By the way, quite a beauty, aren't you? Whoa, wait a minute. No girls have ever disliked me. Come here a minute. What are you doing? Let go of me! Just come with me, I want to ask you something. Thank you. Damn him, he uses Kage style techniques, too. All aboard! Old man. Thank you very much. Oh, please wait. Don't leave your professional outfit behind. A bit forgetful, aren't you? Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it! Just a minute! Hey, let us get on! Hold it, hold it, hold it! Hey, don't act so cold. Company gives comfort while traveling. How about staying with me at the same inn? Tawara-ya here. Tawara-ya here. Stay with us. Tawara-ya here. Princess, the samurai who just stepped inside the inn, is definitely Yagyu Jubei. What? Oh, there's that girl dressed as a monk. She's definantly wearing my clothes. Yu-no-jo, isn't that man Tasaburo the Mist? This is your room. Oh, sir, your room is that way. What is it you need? You're Yagyu Jubei, right? I'm Princess Kiyo, the sister of Nagai Shinano-no-kami. Nagai Shinano-no-kami? Oh. The chief who earns 100,000 koku. Is it that 100,000 koku isn't enough, and you must work part-time as a monk? I'm not crazy. I snuck out of the castle, to travel around the nation for martial arts training. I see, martial arts training. Jubei, our meeting was pre-arranged by the god of martial arts of the Otoko-yama Hachiman-gu Shrine. I shall give you the honor of having me as your immediate disciple starting today. Acknowledge me. An immediate disciple? Being a disciple is one thing, but sharing the same room is a problem. Not at all. I'm comfortable. Don't be concerned. Well, it's me who isn't comfortable. Well, I've already taken care of it. I've told the people of the inn that I'm your wife. You did what? Jubei, I need to change. Help me. Hey, hold it! Hold it! Can't do that! Sir, we're sorry but the inn's crowded tonight. Please share the room with another guest. Ahem! Excuse me. We're sorry about the space. Sir, you said that if I can steal the shakuhachi... - What? Then you'd forgive me, right? I'm counting on your skills as a thief. Do your best. We'll pay you handsomely. Jubei, you should rest now, too. Oh Jubei, you don't have to be so modest. What's the matter? You have a stomach ache? Who are you? Jubei, prepare yourself! Are you fully aware that I'm Yagyu Jubei? Oh, princess! Princess, wait! Princess! Why are you attacking me? Tell me! Tasaburo! Hey, Kamiya. Let's form an alliance just for the night. With the two of us, we can beat Jubei. Tasaburo, so you've finally decided to fight me face to face. And is your name Kamiya? I see, you're Kamiya Yu-no-jo of the Ryuzoji Family. Yu-no-jo! Come on! Princess Yu! Jubei, let's hold off this fight. Wait! Old man. Wait. What, you've changed your clothes again. And walking around in a night gown. Princess! What a shame! Dressed like this, you think you can fool my eyes, but it won't work. Let go of me! Princess! - Jubei... What, did I hear you say Jubei? Oh, brother! Oh, Matajiro. I received your letter in Edo, so I hurried here to bring the news to you. What? Please hurry back to Edo. What, to Edo? The word about the scroll has spread within the shogun administration. It seems that Senior Advisor Sir Doi Oi-no-kami, Junior Advisor Sir Nagai Shinano-no-kami ... ...and the likes have begun their search for it. I see. Father has sent word to Yagyu Shin-Kage disciples across the nation. They're all prepared for the inevitable. For the inevitable, I see. Stop. I'm Sugi Maeshiro, a ronin from Bushu. I presume you're with the Yagyu Shin-Kage school. I'd like to challenge you. Indeed, I'm Tanaka Jinbei, from Higo Kumamoto. Kumaki Eiroku here, from Gunma Choshu. I practice a few techniques of the Hikita Kage school. So you're with Yamada Fugetsusai! They knew we were on our way to Edo, being summoned by Master, and ambushed us. Yes. Let's hurry on. You are...? Yamada Fugetsusai. There you are, Fugetsusai. Jubei, come at me! Jubei! Fugetsusai, see you in Edo! Well, there's a long line. Hey! Where are you going? Hurry up! We're freezing here! Don't be stupid. I'm cold, too. Hey, Chief! The sun's warm out here. Is that so? Then, let's move to the other side. Yeah, you're right, it is warm. You see. What's your name? Yes, I'm Kyusuke the Locust. Excuse me, is this Sir Okubo's residence? What do you want? Hey, where are you going? - Well, you see... You can't come in. Get lost! You! What are you doing? Hi! How are you? Idiot! What are you waiting for? You need to break that branch! No, no! Not that one, the dead branch on the other side! There, there, that's it, that's it, break that...! Hey, put the slate back in place, will you? What are you doing? Oh, while you're at it, sweep those dead leaves off there! Yes. Yes isn't good enough. That's it, that's it! Keep on, come on, clean them all off! Aaghh, you lazy bum, you can't lie down. Come down now! I want you to move that rock next. Come on, move it. Idiot, you think you can move the big rock all by yourself? That small one over there. That's it, carry it over here. Over here, over here. Put it down! - Yes. Shake the top, shake it. - Yes, yes. Not your head, shake the top of the rock! That's it, that's it. Oh, next, move the bonsai from there to here! Yes. It's quite light-weight. Aaghh, you're not working hard enough. Hurry up! Yes! You're moving so slow! You're not working hard enough. Move it, or I'll punish you with my sword! I'm getting frustrated. Down on your knees! Oh, that's more like it. Yes, that's it. Now, sweep the yard! Hurry up! Yes! Hey, the broom's over there! Oh. Yes! Now, sprinkle some water on the yard. What? Water? I'd rather drink it. What are you mumbling about? Water... Water... Hey, hey! Where are you going? The well's that way! Yes, over there... Servant, wait! By the way, who on earth are you? What? Well... Idiot! What did you come to this place for? Whose house do you think this is? It all began when I was at the tender young age of 16... ...in the very first battle I fought as a warrior, I received an award for great achievement... ...and now 60 and some years later... ...Sir Okubo Hikoza'emon is... ...the respected and influential supervisor of the state of affairs, and this is his residence, yes. Oh, so you knew. Oh, excellent! So what did you come to my place for? Yes, I've been sent here by Matsushima-ya pharmacy to work as a servant. My name is Kyusuke. Kyusuke? Yes. Well, your previous occupation was... a thief. A thief, huh? You're an honest one. I order you to accompany my trip right now. Yes! Okubo Hikoza'emon shall visit the castle. Bring out the tub. Yes! You mean, fill it with water? Munenori, you are the martial art instructor for the shogun family... ...as well as the supervisor of the government officials. There's a dreadful rumor regarding the Yagyu Family that's been going around... ...which you must be aware of. What do you intend to do about it? Well, what kind of rumor is it? I haven't the slightest idea what it is. Quiet. Sir, is it about the two volumes of the Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll? That's right. You sure live up to the reputation as a sharp one. It's a scandal involving the Yagyu Family that holds an important position with the administration. I'd like us to come up with a good solution, as to how to handle the situation. A scandal? The rumor that the Yagyus are plotting a revolt. What utterly unexpected words to come from you! I said it's a rumor. However, Munenori, if the rumor indeed is an unfounded one... ...you should bring to me the Suigetsu volume that's in your possession... ...and get the administration to search out Ukibune, the other volume. Obtain the two volumes... ...and you can make a public statement to prove the innocence of the Yagyu Family. Sir Izu, you and the Yagyu Family are blood relatives, and closely associated with each other. Don't you think this is a good idea? Well, indeed, I'm a close relative of the Yagyu Family. However, this is an important matter involving the state. Judgment without considerations for personal interests is called for. That's why we must make it public immediately, make clear the black and white of the matter... ...and let the world know there's nothing to hide... ...in the way of justice with the shogun's administration. If we ignore the voice of the commoners, we who are in charge of the political affairs... ...won't last for a single day. Wait, please. Your concern is fully understandable. However, since it is a matter of grave importance... ...becoming so easily influenced by trivial rumors may lead to disintegration of the way of justice. I, Nagai Shinano-no-kami, shall say this from loyalty as Junior Advisor. Sir, being so easily swayed by people's rumors... ...affects the dignity of the administration itself. Shinano, you say it's a trivial rumor. If, however, anything happened to Yagyu Family, Sir Izu won't go unharmed, either. If anything happened to Sir Izu who Milord entrusts important matters with... ...it will surely cause a chaos in the society. That concerns me, as a loyal servant to Milord... ...and that's why I suggest the notebook be made public as soon as possible. Now, Shinano, locate the other volume immediately. Munenori, bring the volume in your possession to me, as early as tomorrow. Understood? My, what a gathering, of such honorable gentlemen of the cabinet. All together. What's the topic of the discussion, may I ask? Sir, we're having an important discussion here, please excuse us. An important discussion? Excuse me but, I have a direct order by Milord to supervise all matters that go on in the state. Sir, my eyes, ears and mouth are all messengers of Milord. Therefore, it is utterly strange and unheard of that you try to leave me out of an important discussion. That just can't be true. Hmm, I see. I got it. You must have said a mundane, not important discussion. I've heard you wrong, right? You were having a chit-chat, weren't you? Oh, Yagyu is present, too. Sir Munenori, I guess there's no need to be formal if you were only chit-chatting. Come, come. Remember the thing we talked about the other day... Excuse us, excuse us. Come on. Looks like you were being bullied. Sir, as always, I'm grateful. Not at all. I consider you and Izu my sons. You're the two pillars of loyalty who are indispensable for the administration's future. I'm not going to let you be crushed by some stupid orders. By the way... Have you found the Ukibune volume yet? Unfortunately, as Jubei informs me... ...some Princess Yu, the surviving daughter of the Ryuzoji Family has it. Ryuzoji... That family was accused of a revolt scheme and had its status stripped away about 12 years ago... ...correct? Yes. Jubei says he was attacked by a young man named Kamiya who's the bodyguard of Princess Yu. Hmm, the Ryuzojis would deem the Yagyus as their enemy. Munenori, it doesn't look good. Yu-no-jo, will we be alright? When Senior Advisor's procession comes out we'll follow them. When they come to a more deserted area we'll make an appeal to him. The only hope we have for the restoration of the name of the Ryuzoji Family, is... ...to prove innocence of the family accused of a revolt, by showing... ...Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll to Sir Doi Oi-no-kami, the most influential man of our times. Yagyu Oh, O-Yuki... ...that smells good. The plum trees in Ohmori must be in their full bloom about now. Brother... I'm a bit surprised you know how to appreciate the subtle changes in nature. Thanks a lot. That's quite natural, isn't it? A marriage is currently being arranged for brother with some beautiful princess, you see. What? O-Yuki, is that true? Oh, did you not know? Father hasn't told you anything? No, nothing. Who's the lady? I forgot. I guess they don't want people to know yet. It's a secret. - O-Yuki... Rather than being concerned about brother's engagement... ...why don't you start worrying about yourself? Look at those plums. They're nice while blooming, but they'll soon shrivel up into dried plums. Oh, father. Jubei... Matajiro... At this time, I want to tell you what the Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll truly is. The Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll is a collection of signatures of people... ...in favor of a revolt against the Tokugawa Administration. What did you say? When, at long last, Lord Ieyasu established the foundation of the administration... ...some of the daimyo lords who hadn't been previous hereditary vassals and aristocrats in Kyoto... ...were still hoping to somehow turn the administration over. Lord Ieyasu was deeply concerned about the possibility... ...and dispatched a large number of spies throughout the nation. The spies were managed by my own father Sekishusai, and me, Munenori myself. For that reason, we the Yagyu signed our names in the Martial Arts Scroll... ...making a false pledge to support the revolt. But now that Lord Ieyasu has passed away... ...we have no means to prove our innocence. If the Yagyu were to tell the truth about what happened, we'd let it be known to the public... ...that the Yagyu Shin-Kage school, the personal martial art instructors for the shogun family... ...really was a disgraceful spy organization. This is the Suigetsu volume. Now that we're faced with the predicament, in order to preserve the integrity of our school... ...and to prevent our many associates including Advisor Sir Matsudaira Izu-no-kami... ...from being negatively affected... We must retrieve the other Ukibune volume, at all costs... ...and bring the two volumes together, into the possession of our Shin-Kage Clan. Exactly. Can you pull it off? We have many enemies. I understand. Alright. Then, try and take my sword away from me. An intruder. Intruder! Intruder! Jubei, well done! The intruder was Tasaburo the Mist of the Hikita Kage school. He isn't likely to be caught if we chased him. Intruder! Oh, blood! Jubei got you, didn't he? I saw the Suigetsu volume. Jubei and Munenori are both to be feared. They knew I was hiding in the ceiling and went along like nothing. They had the nerve to spill everything out in my presence, too. I guess since they sensed they're in deep trouble... ...they pulled the strings and tricked us into coming after them. If that's what they want, we could use that pull and smash them. In any case, I wonder if they know we're working for the Senior Advisor? Please hear us out. We understand this is Senior Advisor Sir Doi Oi-no-kami's procession... ...and we have a request to make to him. How disrespectful! Don't block our procession! Get out of the way. Please hear us out. This is Princess Yu of the Ryuzoji Family, and I'm the family's old employee Kamiya Yu-no-jo. We have an appeal to make to Sir Doi. Out, out, out of the way! Wait. Get those two over here. Yes. Go on. The Ryuzoji princess and an old employee, did you say? Tell me what your request is about. We are truly grateful. Senior Advisor, this is Princess Yu, the surviving daughter of the the Ryuzoji Family... ...that had served Tokugawa shogunate for 20 years... ...then was stripped of their status in accusations of plotting a revolt. I am Yu-no-jo, the only son of Kamiya Tenzen, the family's former employee. For over 10 years we searched all over for evidence to prove the innocence of the Ryuzoji Family... ...and finally found out that the family had been falsely accused by the Yagyu Clan. You mean to say your family was innocent of the crime they were accused of? Yes, It was all because the Yagyu Family made false accusations about us. Have you any evidence? Here it is. The Yagyu were the leaders of the revolt. Undebatable evidence that they used the Ryuzojis as a scapegoat... ...the Ukibune volume of the Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll is stored inside. What? In here? Yes. We did all we could to protect it for the past three years. Please kindly consider our request, and with your power... ...allow the name of the Ryuzoji Family to be restored again. Fugetsusai. Yes. Take a look inside. What's going on? You idiots. Depart now. Yu-no-jo, what are you doing? - Please forgive me. All I can do, is to kill myself and seek forgiveness. Don't! I can't let you, Yu-no-jo. We have no choice. We're going to give up. The Ryuzoji Family is gone forever. But Yu-no-jo, you can't go. You're my only hope in life, Yu-no-jo. - Princess. I feel lost. I must be a samurai first, before I can hold you in my arms. My lord, my father, and all the other followers of the family who died... ...how will I explain myself to them now? Yu-no-jo. Princess, I guess I'm just a samurai who has served as a bodyguard for you. Yu-no-jo. I understand. But, I won't let you die alone. I'll kill myself, too. No, Princess. You fools! But it's strange how the Martial Arts Scroll disappeared. You said that Jubei and this mysterious woman shared a room. But there's no way he'd have known the notebook was tucked away in the shakuhachi. Or, was it Tasaburo the Mist who stole it? Anyway, your holding a grudge against the Yagyu is a slight problem. I can't say for sure until I look into this matter... ...but I doubt if the Ryuzoji Family was a victim of the Yagyus' false accusations. I suggest that you meet the Yagyu in person. In any case, if Jubei slept with a girl at the inn... He isn't so shy after all. I wonder who that girl was. Princess Yu, what did you do with the girl's clothes? Yes, I've cut out the family emblem from her sash, which I carry right here. Oh, this belongs to Nagai Shinano. Oh, I got it! I know who that girl is! That Jubei, I thought he didn't know how to court women, but I guess he isn't that shy after all. Aaghh! There it is! Kyusuke, what's wrong? That's enough! You're making me dizzy! Sleepwalking again! Sheesh! Yu-no-jo, Princess Yu, we'll go see the plum blossom tomorrow. It's the best time to visit Ohmori Komurai Plum Garden. Princess, truly gorgeous plum blossoms, aren't they? That's true. ''Plum blossoms unfold; one knows the spring's arrived.'' But I feel sorry for the blossoms to have to have you and brother around. Well, well, how rude, how insulting! Milord, are you going to let her get away with that kind of a comment? Yes, I don't care. We're about to see her act politely. We're here to look at plum blossoms. What's the need to dress up so much? So confining. We must pay respect to the plum trees. Come on, brother, let's begin. Oh, you got some sake? Alright. You made me wear these clothes, I've got to have a drink to relax at least. What the heck is this? I'm shaving your beard off. What? - Stay still. I won't do it. I won't meet any prospective husband. Princess. This meeting has been arranged by Sir Okubo Hikoza'emon. Please meet him if only to be polite. I said I won't. Kiyo, be nice and do it for him. Dear brother, an arranged marriage is an out-of-date custom. Besides, there's a man I've set my heart on. Princess, what an unlady-like thing to say. Well, I believe the man you'll meet today will make a suitable husband for you. I won't, no matter what kind of man he is. This is utterly ridiculous. Matajiro, what do you want me to do? Hey, watch out, O-Yuki, are you going to cut my nose off? Just shave it off now! Let me do it myself. Let go of me! Watch out! Oh... You are... Bumping into each other! Here's the bride, and the groom. What? So, you're the lady... What's the matter, Kiyo? Hurry up! What are you doing? O-Yuki, I feel refreshed after all. Refreshed? You're trying to change the subject. Jubei, don't keep it a secret. You already know Princess Kiyo. Sir, please don't be ridiculous. I know, I know. Now, Jubei, you have yet another arranged meeting today. Another one? Yeah. Come on. Oh, Sir Izu-no-kami. Thanks for waiting. Come on. Jubei, you're yet to have a big surprise. Oh! You... Kamiya Yu-no-jo. Please excuse my rude behavior the other day. This is Princess Yu. Jubei, by fate, I've taken these two under my care. Yes. They desire to restore the name of the Ryuzoji Family. They deeply resent the Yagyu, you see. That's why, I wanted you to meet them, with Sir Izu as a witness. Considering the circumstances back then, I understand how these two may feel. But as far as the punishment the Ryuzoji Family received... ...I have explained to them well that the Yagyu had no knowledge. Yes. I've often heard from my father Munenori that the Ryuzoji Family was innocent. But I wonder why an innocent family had to be punished. That's the point. As many daimyo lords by the new alliance were being punished... ...somebody used this to plot against the family. I will look into the situation thoroughly. Jubei, I've been asked by Sir Okubo to look after these two. Will you help them restore their family name, too? Yes, of course, with pleasure. Princess Yu, Mr. Kamiya... ...will you please accept my offer... no, the Yagyu Clan's offer to support you? I feel as if we have an army of a million supporting us. I'm so very grateful. I got it, I got it. Let's try a commoners' custom here. With our hands like this... Oh, look at that. Ms. Bride is here. Coming this way. Come on, Kiyo. Little O-Kiyo. Come again. - Yes, we will. Oh, we haven't seen you for a while. Where have you been? Mistress has been waiting for you. Come on. Oh, how have you been? Mistress! Honey. What kind of look is that? You know I've been worried sick about you. Where on earth have you been? You said you'd be right back, and it's been over a month. Oh, shut up, stop nagging me. The customers will hear you. I'm in a situation where anything could happen to me at any moment. Hey, they say a man leaves his house to face seven enemies, you know. You sure know how to talk, you devil. My life belongs to someone else anyway. Hey, why don't you warm up a bottle for me? Oh, I forgot. Coming right up. Let me enjoy sake in Edo for a change. Hey, you weren't in Edo all this time? Where have you been? - Calm down. Just a pilgrimage to the Ise Shrine, something like that. I'm lost for words. So, it was that girl. I see, Jubei isn't so square after all. But she's strong willed, and takes care of business. Who is? Well, she's extremely proud and strangely detached... ...most men would like that. Hey, I thought you came to see me... Stupid! It's a daughter of a daimyo lord. A noble princess. A princess? Gee, what a nerve to go after a princess. Go after her? Oh, that's right, that would be fun. Kiyo, don't you feel like traveling again? I won't be leaving Edo that much any more. If you don't hurry, Jubei may go back on the road again. If I don't hurry? You should hand him the item you have. Brother, I've kept it hidden for a reason. You gave me permission to travel around the nation... ...on condition that I'd look for the Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll. By chance I learned Princess Yu had the scroll hidden away in her shakuhachi. Why don't you give it to Jubei? He'd be pleased. Yes. But when I think of how Princess Yu might feel, I feel apprehensive. Also, if it would affect your position because of the Senior Advisor. Kiyo, it's alright. What does Senior Advisor plan to do with the notebook? Honestly, there's something I don't quite understand. Kiyo, do what you feel is the best. Jubei... ...the scroll will be mine as of today. Fugetsusai... ...you must fight me first. Wait! Tasaburo, aren't you? Yeah, Jubei, it's been a long time. Master, I've got it. I've got the Ukibune volume. Oh, it sure is the Ukibune volume of the Yagyu Martial Arts Scroll. That's it, Jubei. Well, now that we're even, let's have a real fight... ...and see if you win or we win. Whoever wins will get both of the volumes. What do you say? You have the Suigetsu volume. We'll wager the Ukibune volume on the fight. They don't mean a thing unless one has them both. Master, rather than just killing Jubei... ...it'll be better if we can make him bring the other volume and then kill him. Yes. What do you say, Jubei? Damn you. Jubei, look. Oh, Princess Kiyo! Tasaburo! If you want to save the princess, do as we say. We'll fight after that, alright? I guess I have to say yes. Alright, the place is Tozuka Field on the edge of town, the time is 6 o'clock in the evening. If we miss it this time, we'll never have another chance to completely smash the Yagyu Clan. We'll draw out not only Jubei, but also his father Munenori, plus all the rest of them, to Tozuka Field. If Nagai Shinano and Okubo Hikoza decide to get involved, too, it's all the more convenient for us. Put all you've got into the fight, as followers of the Hikita Kage School. Alright? Go! Yes! Jubei, are you here to bid me farewell? The peace of the world is what I desire. On your own? Yes, for the pride of the Yagyu Shin-Kage school. Alright. Go. I promise to take care of your affairs. Don't worry about a thing and give it your best. Yes, you have my word. Father! Emergency! Look at this. What's the matter? At 6 o'clock tonight, Yagyu Jubei is scheduled to bring one volume of Martial Arts Scroll... ...and have a duel with the entire Hikita Kage school led by Yamada Fugetsusai in Tozuka Field. Father, brother's gone and so is the scroll... ...which means the message is not a hoax. Brother's opponent, the Hikita Kage school... ...led by Yamada Fugetsusai, is indeed the enemy of Sekishusai and us, the Yagyu Clan. We need to settle the score with them some time. Master, please let us go, too. We beg you please. Please. Please let us go, Master. Everything is going as planned. In addition to the Yagyu, Nagai Shinano is also coming out. Let's hurry. Emergency! Oh, Milord! Emergency! It's emergency! Old man, what's wrong? Yes, Princess Kiyo has disappeared again during the night. I suspect she went to hand the Martial Arts Scroll over to Jubei. Is Sir Munenori home? Jubei! Jubei? Oh, Great Uncle! - Oh, O-Yuki. Where's your father? I wanted Sir Munenori to meet Princess Yu of Ryuzoji, so I brought her here. Where is he? Both father and brother went to Tozuka Field. What? Oh, Sir. - Oh, Shinano. We must hurry. I'll explain the details on the way. Where to? To Tozuka Field. Hurry! - Yes! Hurry! - Yes! Proceed, keep on! Jubei! Kamiya Yu-no-jo hereby offers his loyal support to Sir Yagyu. Jubei! Dear brother! Jubei. Yes. I, Yagyu Munenori, serving an important position with the administration... ...has disturbed the peace of Milord's immediate environment. I am prepared to humbly receive your punishment. Sir Munenori, I, Shinano, am not here in the capacity as Junior Advisor. I am here as Kiyo's brother. Jubei, you protected my one and only sister. I am deeply grateful. I am humbled. Put it down! Oh, is it over? Is it finished? Oh, how regrettable, what a pity... No, that's not true, it's all well. Princess Yu and Yu-no-jo have reconciled with the Yagyu. I assure your Ryuzoji family name will be restored once again. The Hikita Kage school that tried to defeat the Yagyu is now all gone. Sir Shinano, Sir Izu will surely be elated. Sir, this is all owing to Jubei's efforts. That's right. Jubei... Why don't you hold Princess Kiyo a little closer to comfort her? It's not over. It's not over yet. The sun must hide behind the clouds again some day. Translated by Ann Jiitsu Subtitled and Mastered by Cannibal King
