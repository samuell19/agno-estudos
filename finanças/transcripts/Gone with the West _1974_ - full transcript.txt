[inaudible] [crowd cheering] [man laughs] [inaudible] [crowd laughing, screaming] [roosters crowing] MUSIC: Life isn't just a Sunday picnic, life isn't just a ball. Life isn't just a bed of roses, life isn't just at all. But a man can speak out for justice. And make sure that his voice has been heard. Life isn't just. In a man you can trust. For a man is a man of his word. A man can be kind and gentle. And at times walk away from a fight. But he'll still be around when the chips are all down to stand up for whatever is right. Yes, a man can be a man. And a man must be a man. [dogs barking] MUSIC: Life isn't always milk and honey or breathe without a care. Life isn't always fair and sunny. Life isn't always fair. But a man can make up the difference. A man can even the score. He can take every blow that the world can throw. And he'll keep comin' up off the floor. A man will do what he has to to avenge who he'll balance the scales. Though it takes time to do it, in the end he'll come through 'cause he's stronger each time that he fails! Yes, a man can be a man! And a man must be a man. [slow music] You, ah, you need a hand? I, uh, I work real cheap. You hungry? They're havin' some bread and cheese and some home brew in there.

Life isn't always fair and sunny. Life isn't always fair. But a man can always use judgment. When nothing's all black or all white. He can find the right way through the shades of gray like the dawn between darkness and light. A man may be just a poet. Or a man may just sing a song. And a man may be meek, may be feeble and weak, but he's strong when he's righting a wrong. Yes, a man can be a man. And a man must be a man. Men are created free and equal. But they're not equally free. 'Cause some are a lot more equal than others. That wasn't meant to be. But a man can make up the difference. A man can even the score. Hey. You killed everybody but the camera man. THEME MUSIC: Every blow that the world can throw. And he'll keep comin' up off the floor. [gunshot] A man may be big as a mountain. A man may be big as the sky. Though he's big and he's bold, he's not ruthless or cold. 'Cause a man's never too big to cry. Yes, a man can be a man. And a man must be a man. The world's not exactly what you'd pray for, what you'd like it to be. [laughs] Good things in life you've got to pay for. Freedom is seldom free. But a man can be his own... [laughs, shrieks] And a man can stand black as stone. He can stand all alone. He can face the unknown with the strength to go on on his own. A man can go into battle. And without even batting... Wrong! [gunshots] THEME MUSIC: He can wade into hell but you can't ever tell that he's really afraid that he'll die. Yes, a man can be a man. And a man must be a man. I don't care for worldly riches. I learn what I can. I don't care if I just dig ditches. But let me be a man.
