They say the day you record your first comedy special is a bit like your wedding day, except you have to do it twice and it's just you up there and there are no, there's no officiator, and there's no vows, and no flowers. It's, it's I mean it's nothing, I don't know. No one says that. Look guys I didn't wanna do this, but I just wanted to get stuck in, to the show. Oh look a man's offering me a Perrier, but JR, the guy on my right, your left, he said I should open the special with a sort of behind the scenes video showing how the artist prepares. I said that was pretench. He said saying pretench was pretench. I was tired and I think it might have been stipulated, I had to do it in the contract, so here we go. The artist ties his shoe laces. That was a little scene that we shot. The artist eats fruit from the rider, that's a technical term for all the stuff they leave in the dressing room. Gets groomed. Not like that, but you know hair and make up. Drinks coffee. Drinks more coffee. Drink incredibly too much coffee. Panics and genuinely considers doing a runner. Employs Ranging Bull technique to artificially boost self esteem. You're a funny guy. Reads set. Discards set. Considers writing new set. Visits stage. - Thinks about Drew. Who is Drew? What makes him tick, and why is he so in demand. Wonders whether the sign is big enough. Questions whether size of belly could be reduced in post. Notices a lot of pointing going on. Tests out effectiveness of pointing. Enjoys pointing. Resolves to point more often. Marvels at all the people. He never thought he'd need so many people: the people pressing buttons, the people operating cameras and lights, the person outside scaring the audience. Is rendered incapable of forming complete sentences. But when I'm, when we, can you? Pretends to understand technical jargon. - Panics about trivial things. Is left alone in the dressing room for an extended period of time. Contacts agent to, darn show called off. Accepts this has all been a terrible mistake. Discovers fridge has Diet Coke, performs cool cut away shot for no reason. Wonders if they really thought he was gonna wear the jumper with the big flower. Generates distractions to go with nerves. Contemplates nature of the self. Eats more fruit. Remembers what the cut away shot is for. Is forced to make last minute changes to material to render it quote, "less actively racist". Expresses resentment for having to do behind the scenes opener. How long are you going to be here for? Hi everyone. I spend an enormous amount of time on the internet doing stupid, stupid things like reply to emails that are not meant for me. I do a lot of that. I get a lot of emails that are not meant, different Veitch's, different Veitch's. I got an email that was for Alan and Deb Veitch. I have no idea who these people are. No idea. But it was the--basically, they were getting a, they were getting a swimming pool built, and they've had like an estimate. And it was basically, it was a guy called Lex Fischer. Runs a company called ReLex Pools Let that sink in. And the pool was 102 LF, and I thought I'd give it a whirl. I thought I'd just reply. So I replied. I said look what does LF stand for? And they got back to me and they said LF stands for linear feet. Janice did not seem to mind or notice the fact that I was neither Alan nor Deb. And I thought that's interesting. So she said, "see attached plans". Now guys these are the plans they attached. Now that's stub, see that's the, their neighboring house is there. That's Alan and Debs house. And the proposed swimming pool on the top left. And I wanna make one thing very clear, you should never reply to an email that's not meant for you. You shouldn't do it. You should just let the people know that they've made a mistake and delete the email. However, looking at that, I don't know about you, but to me, I just didn't think Alan and Deb were gonna be happy with that. Long term. I said "Janice, I'm gonna be frank." "I'm unhappy with the size of the pool." She said, "Mr. Veitch, it is not legal to build on private property. The pool is as large as it can be without encroaching on your neighbors property." "Old Man McPherson? He won't mind. We're still skimping on the size of the pool. I don't want people to come 'round and be like 'Where's the pool?' Balls on the line Janice, it needs to be larger." "How much larger?" Boom. "That is not possible." No shit Janice. "We cannot build that close to the property." Well I took out the property. I thought that she would know that I was joking, right? No, no, no, she said, "Where will you live?" I said, "Boom". Guys I don't know why I do some of the things that I do. Well, I'm just not meant, I don't think I'm meant to be like an adult. I always thought that when I was growing up, I always thought I'd realize that I was suddenly an adult, some sort of way. I failed my first job interview. This should tell you something about me. I failed my first job interview. It was for a cashier in a supermarket. I failed, because, when they, when they asked me what's my weaknesses were, I said organization and punctuality. And then when they asked me what my strengths were, I said Russian literature. I just thought there would be a way that you know that you're a man. You know what I mean. That you know that you're like, oh this is what adulthood is and this is what, oh okay I get it now, and this is what I'm gonna do. But thus the way you discover you're a man is the way I think everyone discovers they're a man which is like you're walking down the street, and then someone else is walking down the street with their child. And they say to the child, "Oh, mind the man." And then you're like oh, where's the, I'm the man. I am, uh, was thinking about the fact that look everything that I thought when I was a child about adulthood, is not come to fruition. Everything I thought was so simple as a child, has become really complicated and I was trying to do this words and I couldn't really, so I did what I think anyone would have done in this situation. I sent an email to Kinder Surprise. I said, "Guys, I'm having some significant difficulty putting together one of your surprises." It's really hard, and this is coming from someone with a masters in mechanical..." that is not true. I should point that out. That's a hundred percent not true. They got back to me. They said "Dear James, thank you for email. May I ask what difficulties you are having?" Said Stephanie on the consumer relations team. I said, "I've been building the toy for fifteen hours straight. How do you expect children to do this is beyond me!" To put this in perspective, I mean again, that's a lie. She said, "Our surprises are designed to be assembled by a child of three years." I was not happy about that. She said, "Normally all our toys come with a set of instructions. Do you have those?" And this is what I've been waiting for. I said, "Yes, actually I can't help feeling they could do with being expanded. See attached." Now truth be told guys, I did not have those instructions. I didn't even have a Kinder Surprise. But what I did have, was two free days and I said, as I think we've already established, a flair for Photoshop. So remember to illustrate the fact that I think that things were so simple as a child, have now become so complex as an adult. I sent them this. "Dear James, I will send you vouchers for a replacement." Oh yes. - Like I view my kind, my life is material. Everything I do I just have fun with it. I think, well, here's an example. It's get me into trouble basically. I went to the, I was invited to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Really, really exciting thing to be invited to. And they invited me to it, they sent me the plans of the venue I was going to be at. So they said look, that's what it looks like, that's the kind of layout, that's the chairs, that's the lighting rig, et cetera. And I shouldn't of done this, because this is a professional engagement. I don't know these people, they don't know, why do I do...? There's something in me that just makes me... I don't know why. I said "Guys, just looking at the PDF, I have one or two fairly serious concerns. Does this guy... he thinks we can't see him here but..." When I went to the, when I did the Melbourne International Festival, at the beginning, they have this gala thing, big gala. And what they do all the comics come out and they do five minutes of stuff then you leave the stage. All the comics, each one. And then at the end of it, what they do is they have this big kind of thing where they make all the comedians come back on stage and they play this really loud music and they go, "Goodbye". And they, like a confetti cannon goes off. The music comes on. We're all meant to go like, "Woo!" But what's the point? What is the point? In anything, but particularly in that? What is the point? And basically, I just don't like... Twice I tried to hide in the bathroom, and twice I've been caught. And forced to go, and this time they literally pushed me on stage. I did not know this was filmed or aired. You know what I mean? I saw some of the, but someone pointed this out to me. I only watched my bit. I did not know this had been filmed. Someone pointed this out to me. This is what happened. See if you can spot anything untoward. - Now ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for everybody you've seen tonight as I welcome them back on the stage! Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much, good night! - They fucked me! They completely fucked me. Honestly that's the last thing you saw before they adverts. You know what that is? - Good night! I can't hide it. I can't hide it. I don't like tedium. I don't like boring stuff, and that's, what is the? My life is 90 % tedium. Do you know what I mean? I don't want to get to the end of my life and this is what I worry about. I don't wanna get to the end of my life and discover I've been paying attention to the wrong things. I spent my life on too much TV, but not things that are genuinely important. I recently, I discovered that I'd spent the lion share of my-- and I'm old, I just moisturize. I'd spent the lion share of my life saying "my-zulled" instead of mislead, when I read it out, in a book. I'd be like, oh, "my-zulled". He was my-zulled. And a friend said to me, he was like, "Do you mean mislead?" And I was like, "No." You have been my-zulled. I just worry that sort of thing is gonna happen to me. I'm gonna get to the end of my life, and realize I've been doing something wrong all the way through. And the problem is, there's so many things in this world that we have to pay attention to, and it's hard enough to discriminate the things that are important and the things that aren't without companies trying to pretend that they're more important than they are. Here's a case in point. I get my haircut in London at a place called Headmasters. Obviously. I can't, I just can't see. Whenever I call up to get my haircut, I say, "Can I have an appointment to cut my hair?" And they say, "Well who do you wanna cut your hair?" And I say, "Preferably someone who can." And they say no, no, no James, we have all these different types of people. We have like the Stylist, the Senior Stylist, Designer, Master Hair Designer, the Team, what is the point in like all these people? They got a Master. How am I supposed to know that a Master Hair Designer is not as good as a Team designer, or a Senior Consultant? And what is, they've all got their arbitrary price points like how am I supposed to know that a Master Hair Designer is three pounds less than a Team Designer? What does that mean? Also where'd you get the stylist from? Did you just drag them off the street? I thought they deserved to be called out on this. So I sent them an email. I said, "Dear Headmasters, I was pleased with my recent haircut until I saw my friend Nige sporting his haircut. I was devastated to discover that despite paying significantly less than me, Nige had come away with a comparable haircut. How do you account for this?" They got in touch, they said, "James, I'm really sorry your appointment left you less than satisfied. What exactly were you disappointed by? Your feedback is really important to us." I said "Jennifer, basically Nige always books a Senior Stylist so I figured by booking my appointment with a Master Hair Consultant, I was ensuring a vastly better haircut. But this was not the case. Also I didn't get a biscuit with my filter coffee and he did." I wanted to include some kind of, a picture, speaks, says a thousand, so I basically look we've got the promise right? And what I've done is I've got all the kind of, I don't think I'm a normal comedian. I mean I was looking at this the other day and I was like what the hell is that? When did I make that? Put yellow arrows and bits, I don't even know what formed that. What am I doing? Anyway, the promise, I thought it resembled, the reality, much smaller margin between Nige and I, do you know what I mean? So "James the class of stylist is based on their experience. I'm very sorry that you feel Nige's haircut is better than yours. Your feedback is really important to us." And I said, "Oh, I don't, Jennifer. His haircut is definitely worse than mine. It's just that it's worse... I said "I was seen by a Master Hair Consultant, by my calculations, I walked out of the salon just 16.92 % shy of the elusive a hundred percent perfect haircut. Yet, despite being cut by a Senior Stylist, Nige's hair looks like it could have been done by a Team Designer. If I didn't know better Jennifer, I'd suspect Headmaster's of fabricating arbitrary job titles to make haircuts seem more important than they are. Also, Nige got a biscuit and I didn't." I wanted to include some stats guys, 'cause you can't rely upon words, so obviously that's where obviously Nige should be. That's where Nige actually is. That's me, perilously close to me. And that's really what we, that's what we all aspire to. That's the hundred percent perfect haircut. So "James my manager is asking what you mean when you say 100 % perfect haircut?" I was really glad she asked me this, 'cause this gave me the opportunity. I just, I meant something like, you know. "Dear James, I'm delighted to say that we can offer a free cut and style, 30 minutes!" I was like "It's amazing right?" It's what great, to be honest obviously, a question had been left unresolved, so I sent her a pie chart explaining exactly what had happened. It's fairly self, it's like. "I will make sure there is a biscuit." The world filled with distractions. Even as something as simple as walking down the street, can be tough. That's why I never leave the house without my Macintosh classic. But I never leave the house, but when I do, I always have my Mac, I just carry it with me at all times is what I'm saying. Whenever a new piece of technology comes into the marketplace, people are intimidated by it. I'm not a teacher, but as an early adulter, I lead the way. And I teach people, so I am also a teacher. But with an eight megahertz processor, I can pound out spreadsheets like there's no tomorrow. But there is a tomorrow, and it's right after today. And when the workload gets heavy, I bust out my ideal setup. I'm James Veitch. I take each day as it comes. The computer does the hard work. Portability's key, whether it be writing report, updating a spreadsheet, or doing other business things. With a Macintosh Classic, I don't have to be chained to my desk. With just a few adjustments, I can be anywhere. James Veitch, Disruptor. I think we need more magic in the world. That's why I don't like the TV. I think we need to do more, so I just do stupid thing, again I don't know why. I don't know if you saw the thing with the ducks? And the thing with the ducks, I was basically harassing my family, by essentially, by putting more and more ducks or different... It's a long story. But basically, I went out into that bathroom. I would also do something else. Which if this gets aired, she'll discover. I went in there and I picked up her, I picked up her conditioner in the bathroom. And if that conditioner was less than half full, I would take it into my bedroom where I bought the same brand conditioner. And I would kind of refill it to like about 2/3 full. And I would sort of, I would cover my tracks as best I could. And then I would put it back in the bathroom. I did that for a year and a half. And I never mentioned it. And she never mentioned it to me. My question is this, what did she think was happening? 'Cause she didn't have to buy conditioner for a year. And the thing is she must have noticed right? Because I did it to her conditioner, but I did not do it to her shampoo. Still never told her. I do, I do, a lot of companies hire me now to go around, to go to the companies, and go around the world, and kind of do these kind of keynote presentations for them. Because I use slides, I think they think they're learning. I don't know how to tell them. Every time I do it, I mean I get these faces, got company solos coming, I go around, and I do a bit for them and their companies. It's a, it's a bit, soulless. Every time I do, I lose a bit of my soul, um, but I gain a bit of a house. So it seems fair enough. Every time I do it, I have to sign a speaker form. It's always the same. It's always the same sort of form. It says James Veitch is his name, then it says Title, and I don't have a title. All right well what do I put, but the other person who had written President. So I was like, well fuck it, you know. You could say anything. You know what I mean? You could just, I don't anyone checks these things, because I've been doing it every single way, Vice CEO of the Chairman Board of Chairmen. Event Manager. I said 100 % Professional Businessman. James Veitch, Senorio Importanzio Is that a thing? It sounds like it should be. I'm single. Woo! - Obviously, nah, nah. So I've been doing some dating websites. So I was on this one. I was on Guardian Soulmates, but they kicked me off. They kicked me off, because they said, "We're writing to let you know that your Soulmates profile picture breached our terms and conditions and won't be available to other users. Please note the following. Profile pictures should not contain people other than yourself. And this I found is very odd, because, well, this is the picture that I was trying to make my profile. That's legitimately. Shit you not. I just don't think girls are gonna be confused by who they're going on a date with. I sent them an email. I said, "Look mate I need, please I love that picture." Reinstate the picture. The duck works wonders." And they got back to me. This guy called Steve at Soulmates said it's been approved. And I was like amazing, but I was really annoyed with them for having giving me the runaround, and it was a bit silly, so I sent them a letter from the duck. "Dear Steve it's come to my attention that James Veitch has been using my image without my permission." And then he wrote a lot more and then he had to sign it, and it was quite, obviously, just like a more of. Do you know what I mean? And then that was sort of in for a penny, so then I made an actual profile for the duck. 'Cause why not right? Just so I see what happens. Now, despite them saying that that duck is a person, it wouldn't allow me just to put a picture of a duck up there. I couldn't get away with it. It would pop up a lot of things, saying your profile picture has been rejected which really annoyed me, because they said a duck was a person. So I discovered what you can do. Is you can put that picture in, and then you wait a few weeks, and then you swap it out for one that's very similar. Watch very carefully. You wait a few more weeks, you swap it out again. Pretty soon guys, pretty soon, you've just gone full duck. Had to answer some questions about me. I said height, that was the lowest they'd go. Hair, obviously, and obviously star sign, you know. In my own words, "I'm just a duck standing in front of a girl, asking her to feed me some bread." Fuck me. That's get an approval. Wait for this guys. Who I'm looking for? "Someone who fits the bill." Drop mic legend. Had to do some sort of, had to do some pictures. So I picked the sort of pictures that people normally do on their kind of Soulmates profile. You know all their dating profile pictures, so I was like, well okay, first of all, this is so me. And then I work out! Serious face. You have like self, classic selfie. So a girl messaged me. Message said "How does he create the picture? He's got no arms." I'm like, "That's your issue with this?" You just sent a message to a duck. History is important. Obviously, and then you got your "awe", and then that's just me, just messing, you know what I mean? I know they're geese, now. This is what I anticipate. It's all fun and games until James gets hurt. Within the first two weeks, I shit you not, 221 messages. So what I did was prove categorically that I was basically less attractive than a duck. You're not in control of how people see you really, are you? On the internet particularly. You have no control over the way people view you. I know this, because when I was messing the scammers for ages. For and I think they must have done something to my Google search thing, because for ages people pointed this out to me. When you search for me, it says James Veitch, and then it said people also searched for, and I was like "Holy shit!" I don't think he was funny at all. Now people say stuff about it. You can't control this. People say, this guy wrote, "Unfunny joke, long pause and stare at the audience until they laugh, how has this wanker made a career of this?" I said, "By doing literally that." This guy wrote, "Pretty creative as far as comedians go." But then this other guy wrote beneath it, "I kinda thought the opposite." I was like, I wrote, "I mean he's basically a loser with too much time on his hands." But then you're not in even control, you're not even in control, some girl, some person wrote beneath that. "You don't know him personally, you have no right" I was genuinely confused. "James Veitch looks like an adorable bug." I will take it. "I don't know why, but I think you look like a young Stephen Hawking in a way." How young? "And he's hot. If you're into that kind of thing." I can leave that pause for so long. 'Cause everyone, and he's hot, and I want everyone to go "Yeah he is." But instead you all go like, "um-hum." And the joke? Now I'm doing all right. Now if you search for me, this is what happens. Search for James Veitch, it says related James Veitch emails, hummus. When it comes to true portability, it's hard to go wrong with a Message Pad 130. Whether it be crunching numbers with on board calculator, generating a virtual business card, or simply capturing my whimsical ideas, the Message Pad 130 has me covered. Does your mind feel tangled up? Ease the pressure by writing down as much as you can. It's called a brain dump, and aided by Message Pad, I've taken brain dumps all over the London Underground. Other people may choose different devices. Not everyone can take the cutting edge. But with storage for more than 200 contact numbers, I know I shan't be alone for long. James Veitch, Communicator. You gotta be careful out there. I was on Tinder, and this girl called Maurine messaged me. She was really beautiful and she said "Hey you around?" And I was like, "Hello there." In fact I actually, I said, "Hello there." And then she said, "I just wanna say I think you're very sexy." And I was like ooh, glad someone has noticed. I said well "You ain't so shabby yourself Maurine. What do you do? And she said, "I'm tired, I've had such a long day." And I said "Likewise. Plans for the weekend? It wouldn't have escaped your attention, I was bringing some quality banter to the situation. This was, this was. And then she said, she said, "I'm feeling a bit naughty." I know. That's exactly what I thought. And I said, "Not declaring income naughty or naughty naughty?" 'Cause I know which one I am. The income one, it's the income one. She said, "Do you like girls?" I was like okay, I said, well "I loved the first season." She said "Going to change my clothes. Want to watch?" I was like, I mean, "Not really." Do you wanna watch me de-scale the kettle? What are we doing here? Why? Then she said, "I'm naked. What are you wearing?" And I was like well okay, I'll play along. I said "I'm wearing chinos and an Apple Watch, and not much else." Unless you count my, you know, all the other things. And then she said, it really escalated very, 'cause she said "Have you ever made a girl cum?" And I was like well, "Almost certainly." But I was beginning to get a bit suspich. 'Cause she had not been replying to any of my questions. She'd just been like, it seems she'd just been sending a series of predefined statements, and I was beginning to think that maybe she was like a sex robot and not in like a good way. In a like way that she's just, she's designed to get me to click a link. I click the link, I go to some sort of sex site. There are loads of beautiful girls, that are naked. I start going back to the site. I become obsessed. I make like a login. I start spending a lot of money on the site. I get spiraled into debt. I don't know, I've never clicked the link, but I thought maybe I'd try something. Have you ever heard of the Turing Test? Okay, if you haven't, it's a test invented in 1930 by Benedict Cumberbatch designed principally to test whether someone's a robot or not. So I said, (James vocalizing), gobbly goo. And then she said "click join2Watchcam." I was like, "awe". I said "Your feedback..." Whenever I book an appointment for the doctors online, well first of all I don't know if, I do it, I love doing this. I just treat it like a shop. I just google the symptoms for the medication I want. And I get there, I say "I have this." And the doctor says, "Well we have nothing for that." And I say, "Well I think if you check your computer thing you'll discover that Valium will be very effective. Anyway I go to the doctors, and whenever I go there, they ask me to confirm my booking. And they ask me to enter my reason for the appointment. This bothers me, because you know I'll just tell the doctor, like the good ole days. I don't need to enter my reason, become part of the stats it's often a personal thing. So I wrote "Concerned I'm going to die." And they didn't like that. They wouldn't give me the appointment. So next time I wrote, "Death is inevitable!" I did get the appointment, but this is not recommended, because what that meant was I had to spend like 20 minutes explaining to the doctor I was not depressed. She was like "But you've written, death is inevitable." I said, "It is. Did they not? They should have told you this on day one. This is a losing battle you are fighting here." And then because of that interaction, she was a bit flustered and what she said basically I think what she, she really got the wording wrong. What she wanted to say was, have you had suicidal thoughts? But she really messed up the wording, 'cause what she actually said was, "Have you considered suicide?" I said, "I didn't even know that was an option." I can see three possible treatments Mr. Veitch, there is psychodynamic therapy, there is of course medication, or and I know this may sound unconventional, you could just end it all. I went to see a therapist a while ago, and they gave me, I wanted to just speak to a person, but again they gave me this form to fill in. They said "You can't see someone until you filled in the Adult Intake Assessment form." And I was like "Can I not just speak to someone, and then I'll fill in the form if I need therapy." And they said, "No, no, you have to fill in the form." So I went to the waiting room, and I filled in the Adult Intake Assessment form. The first question was, "What do you consider to be the top three stresses in your life?" And number one, right up there, was obviously Adult Intake Assessment forms. Really, you know, and then the second, of course would be followed by the formal classification of ineffable and principally subjective thoughts, for the purpose of generalized psychometric analysis. Airport security. And then I went back to the reception area and I said, "Look, I filled your form." And she said, "No, no turn the page." And there was another one. There was another one. This one was a multiple choice form, and I was like "Can I not?" They said, "No you have to fill in that form as well." I was like all right. This was a multiple choice form, and the first question was "How often do you misplace things at home?" And I said "Often." And then they said "How often do you have difficulty getting things in order?" And I said well "rarely", but then I realized I'd had some difficulty and actually got these in the wrong... "How often do you make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring or difficult project?" And I said absolutely "Never". I was having a great time. "How often do you find yourself unable to make decisions?" I spent a long time thinking about this one. I said, "Sometimes." But then I realized I don't know. "When you're in a conversation, how often do you find yourself finishing the sentences of the..." I was like "literally all the time." Got in to see the therapist. It was great fun, 'cause you get to answer all the fun ones like she was saying to me, she was just asking me all of these... She would say, "Do you ever not listen to the question that was asked?" "I'm sorry, I'm sorry what?" Best question was the last one. She said "I'm so sorry James, I have to ask you this, "Do you ever hear voices?" And I went like this, I went, "No." You know in your passports, you have like emergency contact. That's a British passport, but your American passport, you'll have emergency contacts in them. Has anyone filled those in? Has anyone filled in the emergency? Yeah who have you put in? My dad. - Your dad. Anyone else? Yeah who have you put in? Mom and dad. - It'd be cool if you put in her dad. It'd be really weird. Anyone else? One over here. Who have you put in? My sister. - Your sister. I just put Matthew McConaughey. I don't know him. He doesn't know me, but I think if there's an emergency, he'll know what to do. I was, I spelled Beverly Hills wrong. I apologize for that. I carry this passport everywhere I go. Which means that if something happens to me, Matthew McConaughey is gonna have to be the one who relays the information to my family. Which means it's gonna be double edge isn't really, 'cause my mom's gonna be like well something terrible happened to James, but guess who told me? I put him on everything. I'm like I put him on every, all the thing, I just put him on all these different, Matthew McConaughey. Every time, I just put him. Here's what I think should happen. I want everyone, because who's not put anyone in the emergency contact in their passport? Go home, pull it out, put McConaughey in. Guys if I get enough, if we get enough people to do this, we can change his entire career. Wouldn't that be amazing? We could change his entire... If enough people do it, imagine if I get like 40, 50 million people to put Matthew McConaughey in as the emergency contact. Eventually, the passport people, they'd just start printing it. Yeah but if would enough people do, we may as well just print it in there, so you get McConaughey and one more. Someone filled in the second emergency contact? No? I just put McConaughey in again. I put his, use his Austin, I found his actual cell phone number. I haven't called it, but I think it's gonna be amazing 'cause they're gonna go like, this is ridiculous we can't get a hold of Matthew McConaughey, who's next? Keep trying. So I got a few scams for you. So basically the best scams, the best ones to have fun with are the ones that pretend to come friends of yours, because you can just say anything you want to. You can set traps. I got one from my friend Catherine, or reporting to be from her. It said, "Dear James, Our journey has turned sour." Classic Catherine. "We misplaced our wallet, passport, and cell phone. I will indeed be grateful if I can get a loan of 1,800 euro from you." And I say, "Catherine of course I can help? Is everything okay? How's Keith doing?" So "James, I'm so glad you replied back. Are you heading?" It was always Western Union. I said, "Of course. Don't worry! How's Keith though?" He said, "James, Keith is fine. He's having now with the British embassy to get replacement passports." So quick thinking. "Please go to Western Union." I said, "I'll pop along first thing tomorrow." I must say though, Keith seems remarkably capable... I remember he could roll over, he could woof for a treat, now he's taking meetings at the British embassy?" Photography for me is not just a job. It's a way of life. I mean it's not my job, but it's also a way of life. It's a way of looking at the world, and just seeing what's there, and that's why I use my QuickTake 100 for all my shots. James Veitch, Photographer. ♪ To be so hallow ♪ ♪ To be like nobody else love ♪ ♪ That's how I love you more ♪ ♪ Beyond the midnight ♪ ♪ Beyond the words that I thought were so wise ♪ ♪ Beyond the reason why ♪ ♪ No I don't have an answer ♪ ♪ I only know I'm with you ♪ When I was replying to scam emails, I learned to spot all the different types of scams like you've all heard of the Nigerian prince, but you might not have heard of the altruistic widow, or the cash of gold a soldier finds in a rock. Those are equally ubiquitous scams, but the hardest ones for me to deal with being single, were the honey traps, because beautiful girls would email me out of the blue, and they'd be like "I love you." And I'd be like, "I genuinely wish this would be the case." And they were really well written, well three dimensional characters. Elena, oh she was amazing. Elena said, "I am a girl who loves to give people happiness always." Which is amazing, 'cause that's exactly the sort of girl I was looking for. "My hobbies are reading novels, jogging, listening to music, cooking, listen to music, TV and movies." I said, "That's amazing, my hobbies are playing piano and guitar, pining of girls, worrying about climate change, pining for girls, and the poetry of John Keats." She sent me a picture of her. She was really beau--, look at that, she's so beautiful. That was genuinely. That was the picture and I was like wow, she's, I said that's "Amazing!" Obviously. Then she meant, she said, "This is me, and my passport." I know, I was like, well okay what do we, ya know... What are we doing? She said "All men look on my visual aspect, and I want somebody who will look inside me." Grow up. I said, "I'm so sorry you haven't found anyone to look inside you yet." Here's something interesting right. She's trying to scam me, but I'm also kind of trying to scam her. I'm trying to pretend to be the person who I think she wants me to be. Because basically I was getting loads of material out of this. So I was like wanting to keep it going, and I thought who is Elena's ideal mark? Who does she wanna scam? So I said this, I said, "I've made a lot of money, but I don't have anyone to spend it on. It just sits in a Swiss account earning interest. How boring. Don't go thinking I'm some sort of business mogul, I'm not. I just made a few shrewd investments along the way." It's basically, it's basically, the reason is always so misguided, because basically when I was writing to all the scammers, my desk was in my kitchen. So they were like "What should we invest in?" I was like I don't know, oh hummus. That's why it's always a toaster, and the kettle, and the microwave. But it's gotten a bit out of hand. One of these went a bit viral and then someone messaged me last year. They screen shotted the chat that they had with a scammer, where they said to the scammer, "What should we invest in?" And the scammer said, "Hummus." What the fuck is going on? Maybe high priority, guys potentially this same show is going on in Nigeria, just the other side of it. "I wish I has someone to share my life and wealth with. Someone to keep me from those bi-weekly money bonfires I have in the garden for tax purposes." She said, "I believe you are very attractive man. I'm excited and my head is like any big station with a lot of voice!" "How long...?" She sent me a picture of herself right. This is another picture she sent me. She sent me a picture of her holding a piece of paper, and on that piece of paper is written, my email address, which I've since had to to redact, because of all of you mother fuckers sending me, sending emails saying "Hey KitKat, how about some hummus?" I can't cope with it anymore. All right, it would seem that that's proof that it's her. That she's the one sending the emails, but no it's not. What's happened basically is it got probably a guy who's taken a series of pictures of a beautiful girl. One of her in a shop, another of her holding a passport for you, of which I have not shown you, and then one of her holding up a blank piece of paper. And then every time he wants to scam someone, he just uses Photoshop to put their email address on the piece of paper. And that's when I realized something. I realized I have a copy of Photoshop as well. So I popped it in there, and I sent her this. I said, "Hi Elena, really good to hear from you. Using the piece of paper to communicate. Superb idea." And I didn't hear anything from her, so I thought I'd just, I was like okay well let's make. And I didn't hear anything back, so I went thermal nuclear, and I sent her like, "Ah...". She is Russian, so it makes sense even. I've no real way of beginning this apart from saying that I think it was just because I was bored. But I put a flux capacitor for sale on Craigslist. Do you know, it's from the "Back to the Future" movies. If you have one of these, you can travel back and forth in time. And I put one up for sale. I said, "I discovered I had an extra one after a fuck-up in the space time continuum that now means I have two of everything." Now I put it up for sale. This, this took a... I do these things. I just pop 'em out there, and I just see if some, and then eventually, basically, I just waited to see if someone, and eventually I did reply. A guy called Joe Lawson replied, he said, "So I can use this to go back to the future right?" Question mark, question mark, smiley face. And I said, "You certainly can, Joe!" But crucially, I now had Joe's email address. Which is not a strong position for him to be in. Anyway, because it was a flux capacitor, because it was a time machine. What I then did, is and I set up another email address. This time for Some of you can you see the future of this bit. I then sent Joe an email from himself, from the future. "Dear Joe Lawson, This is Future Joe Lawson. I've come to warn you, do not buy the flux capacitor." Trust me on this, it's a bad idea. Yours sincerely, Future Joe." That's obviously not great news. So I wanted to give him a stock tip. So I said obviously. "Who is this?" I said, "It's you, Joe. 30 years from now. It's mostly the same. Except now you're big into hummus." Oh,, ah. "Enjoy those heady days of abbrevs." "Haha, okay. You're the guy from Craigslist." We got there in the end. "Good one, but you've gone too far." I didn't think I had gone too far. So what I then did, because it's a time travel machine, and I made another email address. This time for futurefuturejoelawson. I then sent Joe an email from the future of the future, copying in Future Joe Lawson. "I am Future Future Joe Lawson." This is what I fucking love about my audience. They love a good fun joke. Do you know what I mean? If you don't love a good fun joke, I don't wanna have anything to do with you. "I am from a future far beyond Future Joe's. I just wanted to chime in and say that you can safely purchase the flux capacitor. It all works out in the end. Hummus still good." But Future Joe, was not happy. He replied to all. "Why should Joe Lawson and I, Future Joe Lawson, trust you?" Future Future Joe was even less happy. He said, "You are not Future Joe Lawson. You are both past Joe Lawson." "Okay stop emailing me." I'm gonna be very honest with you. I'd forgotten about him. I was just having a great, I was like oh shit, he's still here. You know what I mean. I was having the greatest time. "Please fuck off." Future Future Joe was like well, "Joseph, this probably isn't super helpful to point out, but you did just tell yourself to fuck off." I mean if you think about it actually you know what I mean. Like you know. - He said "Joe, I've had an idea. I'm gonna use the Flux Capacitor to go forward in time, and workout whether a Future Future Joe can be trusted." "I'm at work." I started so I couldn't just stop. Do you know what I mean? Future Joe, "I did it Joe, I've gone further into the future, but I can't see Future Future Joe anywhere. Holy shit, I just realized something." He said to that, "I actually can't deal with this right now." "I am Future Future Joe Lawson." It's a bit, I said, it's a "bit of a head-fuck, but there you go." He said, "I'm blocking you." So I had to get in quick, I said 'Your feedback is really important to me." Bye everyone, thanks so much for coming. Take care. Can I get your fax number? Just gonna make a little note to myself, like a to do list. Speak to man on tube. And now I've actually done that 'cause you know, so I can actually take that one off. I've seen beauty in the world. When this guy moves, there'll be beauty in the world. The res, the res on this is like nothing you've ever, you've ever seen. So hang on, I'll take one of me now. Hang on, hold tight. So I'll send that one to you, but you just gotta give me about half an hour. Um, no I'll fax it. Sorry just had to capture that moment. You can't miss these things. Do you know what I mean? Although to be fair, I'm running out of space. I've already used up 16 kilobytes so. It's not even working. I don't know why we're.
