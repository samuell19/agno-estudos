[instrumental music] Some months ago, various persons appeared in the federal courts of New York City and the Panama Canal zone charged with the crime of espionage against the armed forces of the United States. Called to the witness stand they swore to tell the truth the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help me, God. The story brought out at those trials is stranger than fiction revealing the existence of a vast spy ring operating against the naval, military and air forces of the United States. We don't know all the facts and we probably never will but we do know that so far as this country is concerned the story began in a small Scottish town early in 1937. There, in a quiet residential district.. [man whistling] Good morning, Mrs. Macpherson. Thank you and good morning to you. Good morning, postie. Good morning, Harry, my laddie. How are you? Good morning Mr. McGregor. Good morning, Arnold. [doorbell rings] [whistling] It's a fine morning, Mrs. McLaughlin. - Yes, isn't it? - Mrs. McLaughlin, about the mail you getting there's so much of it every day and it seems to come from all over the world. I've many friends who still remember me. - Ah, here, Mrs. McLaughlin? - Yes? If it's not too much trouble would you mind saving some of the stamps off your letters for my wee son Willie? He's fond of collecting 'em. I collect them, too. Very sorry. Good day, Mr. McGregor. That's too bad, Mrs. McLaughlin. [dramatic music] German-American patriots since my arrival from Germany ten years ago I have learned to love the United States. Yes, I love America and I love it all the more because I realize that its deepest roots are essentially German. In all its ways we can see flowing the German spirit the German sense of duty and endurance. [applause] Many people in this country say that we of German birth or extraction are only eight million in the United States. But they deliberately falsify. We actually constitute a total of 30 million here. Yes, America is founded on German blood and culture. [cheering] And as a citizen as a reserve officer in the United States Navy I say that we must unite all those of German blood who believe in the German destiny of America... [applause] ...and to bring this destiny to a swift reality by fighting relentlessly the sinister influences that would destroy us and the new Germany. [applause] We are proud of our new Germany. Proud of its Great Fuhrer proud of our glorious blood and soil. I tell you, Germans must seize the power that's rightfully theirs. We Germans in the United States will soon demand adequate representation in city, county, state, and federal government. And those who fight us must perish socially as well as economically because of our determination to destroy our enemies completely and without any consideration whatever. [applause] Germans must save America from the chaos that breeds in democracy and racial equality. We Germans must make the United States and their America our America. (all) Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! [band music] [indistinct yelling] [doorbell rings] Special delivery, Dr. Kassell. I'll sign for it. Okay. Thank you. [telephone rings] Dr. Kassell's office. Oh, yes, doctor. Oh, Mrs. Kassell's right here now. Just a minute, please. A special delivery letter just came in. Thank you. Yes, Karl? I'm so happy the meeting went so well. Where are you now? I'll be right over. No, I'm sorry. I have some work to do. No, not professional call, it's party business. But why can't I be with you, Karl? I have a right to share all this with you. Or maybe it's something else something you just call party business. Oh, Lisa, it's no use getting into all this again. Now stop worrying and please go to bed. Yes. Yes. Yes, I will. Yeah. [whispering] Wait for me outside. Yes. Huh? Yes. What's that? There's a special delivery letter for you. It's from Scotland. It just came. I'll get it later, but don't leave it around. Put it in the top drawer of my desk. Yes, goodnight. No, don't wait up. [instrumental music] Wonderful speech, Herr Doctor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Simply marvelous. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Bravo, doctor. Bravo. Wonderful speech. Will you join us? No, thank you. I have a call to make. - Hello, Greutzwald. - Hello. Didn't you care for my speech? Mm, yes and no. I'd like to talk to you about it sometime. Oh, by all means. Sometime. Goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. There's a man who is somebody. Why does he say Germans must have power here? Aren't we all supposed to be Americans in America? If you'd read and listen you'd know Adolf Hitler said the fatherland is where the German feet touch the ground. German cooking, the best in the world. Eating, that's all you've got on your mind. Why not? There are more important things to think about these days. Ideas like you heard tonight. How to serve the fatherland. Yeah, but we're in America now. Yes, and that's our opportunity which you shouldn't miss. The trouble with you, Werner you don't have any ambition. Ambition? Ambition for what? What? You will see. Yeah, pretty soon now. (male narrator) During the month of March 1937 a young man appeared several times at the New York Public Library and referred to a copy of the book entitled "German Espionage in the Last War" authored by former Reich's military intelligence chief Colonel Ulrich von Hartman. Describing himself falsely as an ex-officer in the United States Air Corps with access to military and aviation secrets Schneider offers his services as a Nazi spy. Addressing his letter to Hitler's personal newspaper the "Volkischer Beobachter" in Berlin from where it is forwarded to the offices of the German Ministry of War. Here, with methodical thoroughness the letter is referred to the German Naval Intelligence Service where finally it comes to the personal attention of Captain-Lieutenant Wilhelm Straubel who submits it in a report to his superior Captain von Eichen. We'll discuss these later. Next. As requested, our agents in Central America made a topographical map of the island of Escudo de Veragua. How far is it from the Panama Canal? About 100 miles, sir. Got it. - Hoover? - Yes, sir? Have this sent to the naval ministry. Yes, sir. Is that all for Central America? - Yes, sir. United States. - Next. Our agents in Los Angeles were able to get the blueprints of a retractable landing gear used in their new army bombers. - What else? - I also have a sketch of a recent improvement in the sight used in pursuit of machine guns. - Hoover? - Yes, sir? - Air ministry. - Yes, sir. What about the United States army mobilization plans for the eastern coast? We haven't been able to get them yet. Why not? You've had three months. I'm sorry, sir. We're doing everything we can. We're adding new agents every day in order to increase our efficiency in the United States. In these files are reports on 12 new men for your consideration and final approval. I see. What about this Kurt Schneider? Our men in New York have been contacting him for the last three months. You will note the reports are favorable. I don't know, Straubel but a man who writes a newspaper as if he were applying for a clerk's job sounds like a simpleton to me. Perhaps but our investigations show that he is very willing. That's what counts. After all, the Americans are very simple-minded people. It doesn't need a wolf where a weasel will do. Oh? How do we know he isn't a United States government agent? The United States government doesn't think it necessary to have a counter espionage system. Did you give this man any specific instructions? Yes, sir. I ordered him to provide me with the secret radio code used between army airplanes and ground stations. The code, I believe, is known as the Z code. And I also ordered him to provide me with a report on the number of troops stationed in the New York area. But if you are still doubtful I suggest that you have Schlager contact him when he arrives in New York. Very well. Has the Bismarck sailed yet? Yes, sir. It should be well out to sea by now. Von Eichen speaking. Radiogram to Franz Schlager aboard the S.S. Bismarck. "Contact Kurt Schneider 1760 Griffin Street, New York." [dramatic music] [keys clacking] [knocking on door] (Schlager) ...that the whole world is united in its resolve to keep Germany from its place from the sun. That is why our beloved fuhrer demands constant vigilance of us. That is why I call you gentlemen together at the beginning of each crossing to remind you that as good national socialists... ...that as good national socialists you must keep your ears and eyes open at all times. If for any reason you suspect anyone of being an enemy you must report that person to me immediately because only by knowing who are enemies are do we know who to destroy. And when we've destroyed them we can fulfill the promise of our sacred force mission. Tomorrow the world is ours. Heil Hitler. (all) Heil Hitler! One more thing remember that no one, no matter where he is can call himself a German unless he's a national socialist. And do not think that when we land in New York that you are on American soil. Can you escape, shall I say the protecting eye of your government? Dismissed. What does he mean by the protecting eye? Talk too much. You'll find out. Well, gentlemen, how did it seem to you? Not enough interest. No spirit, Schlager. The men seem very quiet. - Not enough enthusiasm. - Yes, I know. But you understand that on board ship we must consider the passengers. Was this your first trip to Germany? No, I was born in Germany. Really? Where? In Lunenburg. Do you know it? Yes, we always get our Christmas candles from there. They smell so good. Yes, the smell of honey and heather. Hills almost as far as the eye can see. And new groups of sheep white against the purple. And the old square with chestnut trees. So old, so peaceful. We used to play there when we were children my brother and I. And you found it changed? Changed? The sheep are gone now. Why? There's Hitler's Storm Trooper in the middle of heather. My old pastor's in the concentration camp. My friends talk in whispers when they talk at all. You have family left in Lunenburg? Yes, my brother and some relatives, and their children. Oh, I wish that... You believe in their system? I believe in the purpose and the destiny of the Third Reich and our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. I have finished. Another thing we've been checking up on the second engineer. - Yes? - You'll order him - replaced by the third. - Any reasons? It should not be necessary to remind you, Schlager that the Gestapo doesn't have to give reasons for its orders. I'm sorry. Franz... Uh, Herr Schlager may I talk to you alone? Go ahead, Fraulein Kleinhauer these gentlemen are friends. I wish, I wish to report someone. - A woman. - Her name? Anna Keller. - Is she a German citizen? - I don't know. Well, why didn't you find out? Well, I didn't think to. No, of course not. Women never think. Did you find out if she had family living in Germany? - I did. - Well, their names? - Addresses? - I don't know, but her family lives in Lunenburg. Lunenburg. Thank you. You may go now. [door shuts] Hilda. Oh, Hilda. I'm sorry I was so abrupt but you understand I had to be - in front of those two men. - Who are they? - State secret police. - Gestapo? They're going to be stationed in New York. Gestapo in New York? Yes, now don't say a word about it. I've got to go back now. They told me to install Fisher as second and remove Wilhelm. I do not protest against party discipline, captain. It's none of my business what the second has said or done but it is my business when they force me to promote a man over someone else's head simply because he's a good Nazi. Don't worry, Klauber I'll get your man back for you. I'm still master of this ship and no political leader is going to destroy the morale of my crew. [knock on door] Come in. The captain sent for me. Come here, Schlager. Thank you, sir. I'm given to understand that you ordered Wilhelm the second engineer replaced. That is correct, sir. Would you mind telling me by what right you interfere with the personnel of this ship? By my right as political leader. We're at sea, Schlager. There will be no politics aboard this ship and only one master. Wilhelm will be reinstated. That's all. I suggest the captain use a little more discretion. You dare to suggest to me? It is always unfortunate to interfere with the acts of the Gestapo. The Gestapo? Then they ordered Wilhelm's removal. But why? I have long since learned never to ask why the Gestapo does anything. For his own good, I suggest the captain do the same. Is there anything else the captain wishes? No. You may go now. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Perhaps we have lived too long, captain. We are dead already, Klauber but our families in Germany are still alive. Hostages do not seek courage. (male narrator) August 30th, 1937, Stuttgart, Germany. Thousands of national socialists from all parts of the world gather for a congress of Germans living abroad. They hear.. [speaking in German] (male narrator) "...we national socialists reject any German whose ambition it is to assimilate with the people of the country in which he lives because we only recognize as a complete German that citizen who always and everywhere remains a German and nothing but a German." Germans in the United States must be brought back to the racial unity and common faith of all Germans. As racial comrades, as Germans we cannot help but be revolted by this basically uncultured country. And we know that if America is to be free we must destroy the chain that ties the whole misery of American politics together and that chain is the United States Constitution. [indistinct chatter] And we also know that there is a wall in which a breach must be made before American's problems can be solved and that wall is the bill of rights. [indistinct chatter] (man) Wait a minute, buddy! Just how do you fellas expect to get rid of the constitution and the bill of rights? What are you? A member of the German-American Bund? No, I'm not a member. I belong to the American legion. Hold on here. A lot of us Americans went overseas and fought you Germans because we thought that the constitution and the bill of rights was worth fighting for. [indistinct yelling] Hey! Hey! Why don't you answer his question? Why do you shout him down? And who are you? What do you want? I am an American of German birth and there are hundreds of thousands like me who stand absolutely against you Nazis. You can't make these ex-soldiers believe that all the Germans in America are traitors like you. We'll fight side by side for democracy. [clamoring] You people made democracy a fanatical faith. It's no use arguing with you. Doctor, please. Force is the only language you will understand and we'll speak to you in your own language soon enough. We don't want any ism's in this country except Americanism. If you guys don't like it here... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've got a right to speak up in open meeting. This is free country. Sure, and we're gonna keep it that way. You guys are worse than gangsters. [clamoring] Stop them, doctor. Stop them. This is no way to handle them. If you feel so strongly about it, Greutzwald why don't you complain directly to the minister of propaganda? [crowd clamoring] [dramatic music] [knock on door] (Werner) Is anybody home? Hello, Kurt. Hello, Werner. Hello, sonny boy. Having fun? What are you so low about? Where's Helen? News from the old country? Nothing important. What's the matter? Rent due again? Rent's always due. What are you doing home today? I'm on leave until Monday. You home, too? - Hello, Helen. - It's fine. Now I'll have two of you underfoot. As if one wasn't too much already. We are not bothering you. I married you, not your pal. Just to see you sitting around doing nothing is enough to drive a person crazy. I'm not doing nothing. I'm thinking. Thinking. The last time he was thinking he ended up by deserting from the army so he wouldn't have to go to jail for embezzling company funds. Now, look here, Helen, I-- He didn't go to work today because he had to think. He's given up his night job at the language school so he'd have more time to think. Go to those awful Nazi meetings. You should think less about some way to get rich quick and more about paying the rent and getting milk for the baby. I'll get more than that. You will see. You'll be mighty proud when people point you out as the wife of Kurt Schneider. He's off again. Oh, come on, Werner. Let's get out of here. No, you don't. You got to take the baby for a walk. Imagine, asking a man like me to push a baby carriage. You see, Werner, the trouble with Helen is she doesn't understand me. She doesn't realize a man like me has to be involved in big things or he's unhappy. But I don't expect people to understand me. Even Hitler had a tough time before he showed them what a genius he is. - He sure did. - And look at him now. Let's sit down here. There was a speaker at the bund meeting last night. He said Hitler would rule the world before long. - Cigarette? - No. Werner, I helped you out of a lot of jams, haven't I? Sure. Why? Well, there's something I want to tell you. But first I'd like to make sure I can trust you. Who, me? You can trust me, Kurt. I'd never let you down. I'd have been in an awful spot if you hadn't given me room and grub all the time I was looking around for a job. I've got to be absolutely sure about you. Come on. What's on your mind? Werner, I'm in the German Secret Service now. You are? Yeah, I'm one of their most trusted men. I get my instructions from Hitler himself. - You do? - Yeah. Pretty soon I'll be in charge of all German espionage in the United States. Golly, Kurt, you must be making a lot of money. Why, money isn't everything. Now listen, Werner, you've got to help me. What do you want me to do? Swear you won't tell a soul what I'm telling you. Alright. I want you to get me the secret code used between military planes and land bases. - The Z code? - Yeah. Oh, I couldn't do that. Why, I'd be court-martialed if they found out that I-- Don't be silly, Werner. Stick with me and I, I'll make you famous. - Rich. - Well, I-- Swell. I knew you wouldn't let me down. Golly, Kurt. I don't know about-- Now listen. That Z code is a cinch to get, isn't it? No, it's not so easy. But you know how to get it. Sure, but-- Well, then get it and stop worrying. I've got a tougher job than that to figure out. How, how do you suppose I could find out how many troops are stationed in the New York area? Well, I don't know. I, I suppose you could check each regiment-- Oh, no, no. That's no good. Don't worry about it. I'll figure out some way to get this stuff. You know me, Werner when I make up my mind to get something I get it. (male narrator) A few days later the sick clerk at Fort Wentworth Station Hospital receives a telephone call. [telephone rings] Fort Wentworth Station Hospital sick clerk speaking. Major Wilton? Oh, yes, sir. I'm delivering a lecture before a group of physicians today and I'll need the statistical reports on army hospitalization to make certain points. Yes, sir. I understand perfectly. The statistical report sent to the northeast corner of 93rd and Lexington Avenue. Deliver it to your personally and you'll be wearing civilian clothes. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. What'll it be? Give me a chocolate soda. Yes. - Hello, Werner. - Huh? Oh, hello, Kurt. - Did you get it? - Yeah. Ah. Where is it? Not here. I'll get it from you later. That's right. Did you get yours? - They're on the way. - Huh? - What'll you have? - Give me a pineapple soda. - One pine in. - What do you mean? What's on its way? The medical report. What do you want medical reports for? You wouldn't know, would you? If you had to find out how many troops are stationed in the New York area you would try to count each regiment. Here you are. But what do medical reports got to do with the number of troops? Don't they always figure the percentage of men sick of the total number of men station in the area? Golly. I never thought of that. Watch me, my boy. And you'll learn plenty. You've got to have brains to figure things out in this business. Brains and daring. Yeah. Stay here. I'm Major Wilton. You are ten minutes late. Sorry, sir. Held up by traffic. Let me have those reports. Yes, sir. - Good. Thank you. - Beg your pardon, sir. - The taxi. - Oh, yes. How much? $2.90. Keep the change. [bell ringing] Yes? - Is Mr. Schneider at home? - No. Do you expect him soon? He should have been home an hour ago. Then may we wait for him please? Well, yes, I guess so. Just go in the other room and wait, please. This way. Just make yourselves comfortable. Thank you. Well, where have you two been? I had important business. I can imagine. You got some visitors. They just arrived. Visitors? Yes, and hurry up and get rid of them. Dinner won't be fit to eat. Do you suppose they, they found out already? Don't be silly. Go in the kitchen and keep Helen out of here. Mr. Schneider? Yes? Allow me to introduce myself. Franz Schlager. Ms. Kleinhauer. How do you do? How do you do, Mr. Schneider? We may talk without fear of being overheard? Why? We have mutual friends in Germany. Colonel Nicolai, Herr Schiller Herr Jaegerschmidt. You come from them? I was sent by Herr Schiller. Just a minute. Have you any means of identifying yourself? Will it satisfy you if I tell you that your last instructions were to obtain a certain air force code and figures on the number of troops stationed in the New York area? Yes. That's correct. Thank you. Now it's to business. You got our last letter. What have you done about it? Well, I volunteered my services to the fatherland but the fatherland has not yet offered to pay me anything. You must first earn it. I'm ready, when I know how much I'll get. You have something? Yes. I believe these will be of interest to you. The Z code. Very good. But we didn't ask for any medical report. You will notice the report states what percentage of the manpower of each regiment is there. A little simple arithmetic will give you the total manpower of the whole area. Well... So you have accomplished something after all. Put these in your purse, Hilda. Not many would have had the daring to do what I did. All right, we will give you $50 a month. That's, that's ridiculous. I have to live. I have to support a family. Do something worthwhile and you will be paid extra. Don't you consider what I gave you worthwhile? Yes, in a way. But what we really want are the blueprints of the aircraft carriers Yorktown and Lexington the eastern seaboard mobilization plans. We also want information concerning aircraft detection experiments being made at Fort Munmus. For those things, you will be paid extra, and well. Here's your $50. Goodnight, Schneider. Well, I think the stuff I've given you is worth something extra. We're not giving away $50 for nothing. But I-- Of course, if you don't want to accept it. - I'll take it. - That's better. It's up to you whether or not you earn more. And remember, we're not easily fooled. You can depend on me. Good. Now one thing more you will send all mail concerning our business to Mrs. Mary McLaughlin One Cascade Road, Argyle, Scotland and you will sign yourself "Sword." I'll write that down. No, you better keep it in your head. Do you have a telephone? Yes. Over there. Thank you. [dialing] Hello, is the doctor there? Franz Schlager. Sword. Mary McLaughlin, One Cascade Road. Hello, doctor. I'll be over at the cafe within an hour. Yes, everything is arranged. The two men I told you about will be there. Yes, doctor. Well, goodbye, Schneider. Well... Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Come, Hilda. [door opens] [door closes] [instrumental music] There was a time I even admired Hitler because I believed he expressed the resentment and humiliation of the German people against the injustice after the war. But now I see only pain and those emotions for his own purposes. What has he not done to all to want us back to Germany? He made us appear savages in the eyes of civilization. If I were you, Greutzwald I wouldn't express such opinions too openly. It might be dangerous. But he's perfectly right, Helldorf. We mustn't be misled by men like Kassell. Eh, Kassell. Kassell thinks he can spread the same hatreds here in America. We must realize that the vast majority of Germans here are ashamed of the black name we are giving them and are violently opposed to these ideas. Be careful. Don't talk so loud. Somebody might hear. You see? Right now he's talking with two of our most valuable agents Helldorf, who works in a big munitions plant and Walter Westphal. Now, you understand I have nothing against Greutzwald personally but with his constant criticism he's endangering our success. Does he know those men are our agents? No, of course not. But he might convince them they are working for a lost cause. And in any case, the party doesn't want criticism only obedience. Dr. Kassell see the gentleman in the small room in the rear. [indistinct chatter] Please understand that. I love my fatherland as much as anyone. But how can Americans possibly have decent, cordial relations with a regime whose aim is to destroy the very best of German culture? With a regime employing methods that have outraged our own people? Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - Dr. Kassell. You know Westphal. Oh, yes. How are you, Westphal? - How do you do? - May I join you? - Oh, please do. Sit down. - Thank you. Greutzwald and I are about to get into an argument. Oh, Greutzwald. Yes, he and I are old platform enemies. One may not agree with him but one must respect his honesty and courage. Thank you, doctor. Oh, not at all. I only wish I could add discretion to that. You have called me an honest man, Dr. Kassell. Yes. You see, I've given a great deal of thought to what you said to me that night of the legion incident and I would like very much to talk it over with you. Alone. Of course. I'd be delighted to. Well, we are finished anyway. Oh, no, no, no. We can go to the private room. Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. Thank you. You see, Greutzwald we cannot afford to have any differences... Greutzwald is right, Max. Art is becoming so bold in this country, so outspoken. Don't be a fool. Nevertheless, I'm beginning to wish I weren't mixed up in it. I wouldn't talk like that if I were you. Yes, Greutzwald, it must be realized that, after all we need to think as one man if our cause is to succeed. Go ahead. Thank you. You said we were going to be alone. I thought these gentlemen would help us adjust our differences. These gentlemen? Yes. We have instructions for you, Greutzwald. You are going back to Germany. Why? What do you mean? Who are you? I'm sorry. I forgot to introduce. Herr Hintze and Herr Wildebrandt. - Members of the Gestapo. - Gestapo? Yes, Herr Greutzwald. Your actions have become much too dangerous for you to remain here. That isn't true. All I tried to do was to honestly point out the dangers of the wrong policy. There's room for honest criticism. When you became a member of the national socialist party you swore allegiance to the fuhrer and blind obedience to party discipline. I believed in national socialism and I trusted our fuhrer. But I disagree now that the party is-- No one disagrees with the party, Greutzwald. You'll discover that when you get back to Germany. But I don't want to go back to Germany. I have done nothing. Please! Please let me go. You can't do this to me. We, we are still in America. I didn't mean anything wrong. Please, I don't want to go back to Germany. I don't want to go back to Germany. I don't want to go back to Germany! Please Herr-- Please don't send me back! I haven't done anything! You can't do this to me. Let me out of here! I didn't do anything. I swear I didn't. Please don't send me back to Germany. You can't do this to me. You can't! You have no right. Oh, please don't send me back to Germany. What I'm trying to do was only... Don't send me back. I haven't done... [dramatic music] [machine clacking] - We say goodbye here. - I can't understand, Karl. Why you don't let me go onboard with you. I'm telling you, I got orders to keep this trip secret. I don't want anyone to see you with me. - I don't see what-- - Lisa, please do as I ask you. Goodbye, dear. And take care of yourself. I'll write often, and don't forget I've gone to Maine for a month if anyone asks. - I won't... - Goodbye. [foghorn blares] [indistinct chatter] [whirring] [dramatic music] (male narrator) Arriving in Germany Dr. Kassell finds a totally different fatherland from the one he left ten years before. Following faithfully the program of the new bible of Adolf Hitler, "My Battle" the Nazi party has created a new fascist society based on a devout worship of the Aryan superman a new fascist culture imbued with the glorification of conquest and war a fascist system of life where every man, woman, and child must think alike, speak alike, and do alike a rigidly censored press with all news colored by the ministry of propaganda a fascist literature shorn of its greatest writers and poets a new religion ridiculing the brotherhood and equality of man before God a fascist economy with its watchword "cannons, not butter" a fascist philosophy with a supreme command blind obedience to the fuhrer. For six long centuries men throughout the world have fought their way out of the dark ages of medieval barbarism but in six short years Hitler's Nazis cast their ominous shadow over the entire Earth. [band music] Inspiring. Positively inspiring. Makes one proud to be a German. Your enthusiasm is reassuring. But not unexpected, I hope. No. You have done excellent work in the United States for the party, Herr Doctor. Thank you. Thank you very much, Your Excellency. That's all. Dr. Kassell we have decided to place you in charge of all national socialistic activity in the United States. I am deeply honored, Your Excellency. And I only hope that-- There will be a slight change in our methods. From now on national socialism in the United States must dress itself in the American flag. It must appear to be a defense of Americanism but at the same time, our aim must always be to discredit conditions there in the United States and in this way, make life in Germany admired and wished for. Racial and religious hatreds must be fostered on the basis of American Aryanism. Class hatreds must be encouraged in such a way that labor and the middle classes will become confused and antagonistic. In the ensuing chaos we will be able to take control. But that will take tremendous sums of money and propaganda. The money will be provided. From now on, German boats touching American ports will carry three times as much propaganda material. Deliver it to our agents in the United States. Look. The United States will be divided into three parts each to have a provincial leader. One will be stationed in New York one in Chicago one in Los Angeles. You will be given the names of all our agents and you will coordinate all their activities. You will see to it that every city town, village in the United States is provided with our propaganda material. So, from now on your watchword will be "America for Americans." But never forget that national socialism is the hammer not the anvil. This new Americanism is a formless iron... ...that we will beat into another swastika. [dramatic music] (male narrator) Nazi propaganda printed in huge quantities by the power presses in Germany carefully devised to fit the official German concept of mass stupidity constitutes heavy cargoes aboard German freighters en route to the United States. They are designed to alter the fundamental ideas of a kindly and liberty-loving people. This material is shipped directly to American ports unloaded with great secrecy, put on trucks and generally prepared for wholesale distribution throughout the United States to New York, Boston, and New Orleans. To the vast midwestern agricultural districts of Minnesota, Illinois, and Wisconsin. To the coast cities of San Francisco Seattle, and Los Angeles. To the great manufacturing centers of Chicago St. Louis, and Detroit. To the great wheat centers of Kansas City Minneapolis, and Saint Paul. Huge shipments a deluge of vitriolic, scurrilous propaganda circulated by the Nazis and certain American sympathizers ready to violate the basic principles of their American citizenship. Aided by the disgruntled the dishonest, and the disloyal an intensive campaign is launched to create mass sympathy for the doctrines glorifying hatred and brute force. [dramatic music] [whirring] The stream of Nazi propaganda insidiously attempts to penetrate every nerve and fiber of American life inciting racial prejudice ridiculing democracy striving to shatter that attitude of tolerance and respect for minority rights which entitle people to consider themselves as civilized human beings while other forces fostered by the long arm of the Nazi intelligence service are at work in centers of the United States defense. [airplanes droning] Well, Werner, it's getting so I hate to go home. Bills, bills, and more bills. And Helen after me all the time. Seems I can never get ahead. Sure don't make much money working for the fatherland. Hey, maybe you ought to try to get back to teaching German at night. There's no money in that. [car horn honks] What's happenin'? It's Colonel Austin, commander of Fort Colton, and his aides. They're being flown down to Washington on a transport. I see. Say, wouldn't an officer in charge of the fort have mobilization plans for this area? Oh, I guess he would. I think I know how to get $2,000. What? It's terrific. It's daring. What's daring? What are you talking about? I don't trust that Schlager. He'll not only take the credit but he'll probably gyp me out of the money, too. What money? Money for the mobilization plans. But I won't give him a chance to gyp me. I'm going to write to Germany directly. That's what I'll do. I hope I haven't forgotten that woman's address in Scotland. [doorbell rings] Good morning, Mrs. McLaughlin. - Morning. - Nice mail, as usual. There's an interesting stamp. - Japanese, isn't it? - Yes. What is it, please? You Mrs. McLaughlin? - Yes. - May we come in? Why? Who are you? British military intelligence. You're under arrest. (male narrator) Because of a postman's curiosity British military intelligence discovers Mrs. McLaughlin is the European post office for a Nazi spy ring that spreads over the whole world and it finds a letter that sends a British official to the transatlantic telephone. Yes. And your Colonel Austin is to be instructed to appear at a secret emergency staff meeting and to bring with him all mobilization and coast defense plans. Once in the room, he's to be attacked. Killed, if necessary. And the plans stolen. The letter is signed "Sword." [dramatic music] As soon as British military intelligence called we went to work trying to find this fellow who signed himself Sword. Did you have anything to go by? - We thought so then. - How long ago was that? About three weeks ago. Sword identified himself in this letter as a former army officer. With important connections at Monroe Field. All right. What then? We went to work immediately. Got a line on every officer or person of any influence at Monroe Field. We did everything else we could think of, but got nowhere. That's why I'm asking the FBI to take over this case. We've got to find this fellow Sword. (male #1) You see, that's a bit out of our line, Major Williams. As far as I know, the FBI has never done any counterespionage work. Well, somebody's got to do it. I can't. The whole staff of the United States military intelligence service in the New York area consists of myself and one assistant. I don't suppose the government thinks the intelligence service is very necessary in peacetimes. That's what's so strange about all of this. You'd think from the number of spies they've been sending over here that we're at war with Germany. On the contrary, it looks more as if Germany were at war with us. Nazi Bunds meeting all over the nation openly training men for street fights teaching them how to use guns and bayonets. The whole country's swamped with Nazi propaganda fresh from Germany. Tie the two together. It looks as if the storm troopers are training to finish off what the propaganda starts. It's a new kind of war but it's still war. Well, how does espionage fit into that? Well, uh, just look at this letter. The man who wrote this is obviously a German but he's not a professional spy. Well, we couldn't find anything about him. Well, perhaps you didn't look in the right place. Got any ideas, Renard? Yes. I'd look into every bund and pro-Nazi organization around these parts. I told you I thought this man is an amateur. If he is, why did he become a spy? Well, because he's been listening to speeches and reading pamphlets about Nazi Germany and believing them. Unfortunately, there are thousands like him in America. Half-witted, hysterical crackpots who go Hitler-happy from overindulgence in propaganda that makes them believe that they're supermen. American Nazi organizations. That's where we'll find your man sword, Major Williams. If we ever find him. [bugle music] [band music] [crowd cheering] (all) Heil! Heil Heil Heil! [indistinct shouts] Attention! Eyes right! Up! You see, this is the type of German-American youth we are striving to develop. - Your name? - Gottfried Simmons, sir. - Rank? - Squad leader. Order service youth, troop C. Do you subscribe to the principles of our glorious fuhrer? - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - Very good. - Thank you, sir. Attention! Eyes left! Up! What are the ideals of German womanhood? To be of service to our fuhrer. To be the custodian of our children until he should call them to arms. Very good. No German abroad may forget that he is always and everywhere a piece of Germany. We must warn the so-called democracies that the fatherland is not only ready but strong enough to protect Germans all over the world. And to you, the national socialist youth of America I bring directly the hearty greetings of our beloved fuhrer Adolf Hitler. Heil! Heil! Heil! - [cheering] - [whistle blows] [drumbeats] [band music] My congratulations, Kranz. It makes me feel I'm really in Berlin. You should begin to train them with rifles and revolvers, Kranz. They are trained. [instrumental music] You can go in now. Thank you. Come, Westphal. Can you tell me if Franz Schlager is here? - Who wants to see him? - Tell him Kurt Schneider. Sit down, I'll let you know. Tell Schlager there's a Kurt Schneider out here. Glass of beer. I've been up all last night getting this finished. Man to see you. His name is Schneider. Who, Schneider? - Tell him to wait. - Yes, sir. I told you, Helldorf is one of our most capable men. Now, with the Zenith Munitions Corporation in New Jersey. You realize, gentlemen there have been so many changes in American anti-aircraft guns since last year. But I was first to work on the ground-up helping them. (Hintze) Of course, you didn't construct this at your factory. No, I had to remember each little part as the work progressed. I fit them all together at home every night. Excellent piece of workmanship. (Helldorf) And you will observe the perfect timing of the mechanism. Constructed to exact scale. Our air ministry will have to express its appreciation of American inventive genius. Miss Kleinhauer, I want you to be very careful handling his model en route. Don't worry, doctor Hilda is absolutely trustworthy. Schlager, when you turn this over to Captain-Lieutenant Straubel in Hamburg I want you to give due credit to our friend Helldorf. My sincere thanks, Herr doctor. Now regarding you, Westphal. Uh, Westphal is with the... In Long Island. I heard your plant is turning out a new-type supercharger for pursuit ships. Yes, we are. How soon can we get the blueprints? I don't know. They're very closely guarded. It's very dangerous. What's the matter with you, Westphal? - Are you afraid? - Yes. What if I should get caught? You'll be properly protected. But Dr. Kassell, I have a wife, - two children. - They should be proud of you. But you don't understand. They are Americans. They'd consider me a traitor instead of being proud. Well, what do you want? Come to the point. Uh, I want to quit. I want to wash my hands of all this business. Are you serious about this statement, Westphal? Well, I... Now, Westphal, have you ever heard of an organization known as the Gestapo? Gestapo? I think, gentlemen, we don't need to be concerned about our friend Westphal. No. Of course not. I don't know. I didn't know what I was saying. No, of course you didn't. I really didn't mean anything by it. I'm very sorry. Quite all right. We'll forget it this time. Here, have a beer. Thank you. Schlager, you may inform Captain-Lieutenant Straubel that you have the blueprints not later than by your next trip. I will, Herr Doctor. That man Schneider is still here. He asked me to remind you. Oh, yes, I'm coming. Excuse me, gentlemen. Where is he? He's sitting over there, Herr Schlager. - You wanted to see me? - Yes, I... I wanted to know if Schuler gave you any message for me. Well, you have your instructions already. Yes, but I thought he might have given you a personal message for me. An answer to the letter I wrote him. - You wrote him a letter? - Yes, to his Scotland address. Quiet. What will it be, Herr Schlager? - Two beers. - Yes, sir. Be more discreet mentioning names in public places. What was your letter about? It was a scheme I worked out. It could hold up the mobilization schedules and coast defense plans. By kidnapping a certain important army officer. Kidnap? Here you are. Thank you. Well, did you get to him? No, I didn't even start. I was waiting to hear from... Well, you know, to get his okay and how much they'd paid for it. Always worrying about money. Don't you see? My wife is going to have a baby. I've got to get some real money. Then you better forget these crazy schemes about kidnapping and concentrate on our instructions. For instance, we could use some American passports. - Passports? - Yes. We need them for our agents going to South America. You mean blank passports? Any kind, old ones, expired ones we'll fix 'em up, only, get some we'll pay you $5 extra for each one. Now remember, I expect something for that $50 a month. - Sure. - Bye, Schneider. [telephone ringing] Passport division, Harrison speaking. Yes. Who? Harold Mitchell, undersecretary of state. Yes, I'm here in New York. It's a confidential trip. Now there's something quite important. I need 35 blank passports delivered to me immediately here at the Hotel Atlanta as quickly as possible. Mr. Harold Mitchell, yes. Hotel Atlanta. But Mr. Mitchell, this is rather an unusual request. I'm afraid I'll have to check back with you. I have no time to waste. This is state department business! Send those passports over immediately! I want those delivered in half an hour at the latest! Yes, Mr. Mitchell, I'll... send them right over. Hello? Extension 615. Passport division? Uh, this is Mr. Mitchell again. I've just decided, if it's too much trouble I'll get those passports in Washington myself tomorrow. Oh, it's perfectly all right, Mr. Mitchell, no trouble at all. I'll have those passports delivered for you in half an hour. Yes, Hotel Atlanta. No trouble at all. Goodbye, sir. Get me the police department. The alien squad. Yes. Can I help you, sir? Why, yes, I was just wondering if, uh... [telephone rings] Excuse me. Hotel Atlanta, room clerk speaking. Yes, sir, I understand exactly. Just a second, I'll see. No. No, I'm afraid he hasn't arrived yet. All right. As you were saying? Yes, I was just wondering if, uh, if you had a Pennsylvania rail road time schedule. You'll find one at the porter's desk the other end of the lobby. - Thank you. - All right. Boy? Operator? Give me Western Union. You want us to pick it up at the Hotel Atlanta? And where should we send the package? To our own office at Grand Central Station. Same name? Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Have you a package for Mr. Harold Mitchell? - Yes. - We're instructed to deliver it to our Grand Central office. Just a minute. There's a Western Union boy outside. He's to deliver the package to the Western Union office at Grand Central Station. - Let him have it. - All right. (Helen) Kurt? Kurt, for heaven's sakes, it's 1 o'clock. You gonna stay up all night? Go on to sleep and leave me alone. Hello? Western Union Grand Central? You have a package for Mr. Mitchell? Will you please send it to your Varick Street office? I'll pick it up tomorrow. Well, yes, Mr. Mitchell. Yes, thank you, sir. - Where did he say? - To our Varick Street office. Thank you. Come on, Fred. To the Queen's Tavern on Walker Street. Yes, Mr. Mitchell, I'll have a boy there with your package right away. Yes, thank you. Queen's Tavern on Walker Street. [horn honking] [horn honking] Eh, shine, buddy? Here, get a shine! Oh, would you like a shine? [indistinct chatter] Hey, Mister, I'm gonna shine you. Hey, would you like a shine? [indistinct chatter] (kid) Please, it's a very good shine. Ah, geez! [car engine revving] (kid) Hey, buddy, let's have the other one. Hey, what's the matter with you? I ain't done yet. - Finished? - Yep. - You're all good now, bud. - Say, uh, there's a package for me across the street in the tavern. Run over there and pick it up for me. There might be a small charge. Here's $2. Tell them it's for Mr. Mitchell. Oh. Here's your package, mister. - Okay. - There's 40 cents change here. - Keep it. - Thanks. Just a minute, Mr. Mitchell. We wanna talk to you. - What about? - About this package. But why? Why is he arrested? He never does anything but sit around the house all day and think. I knew something like this would happen - sooner or later. - Nothing in there, Mac. I told you there was nothing there. Where is he? Tell me - what you've arrested him for. - Here's something, Fred. What is it? What is it you're searching for? You got no right coming around here in the middle of the night disturbing people. Mrs. Schneider, has your husband ever been connected with buying or selling furs? No, of course not. What gave you that idea? Never mind. Sorry we disturbed you. Goodnight, Mrs. Schneider. This is the letter the British Military Intelligence took from Mary McLaughlin and this is the one you found in Schneider's apartment. - Is that right? - Yes, Mr. Renard, that's right. All right. Thank you. Uh, bring Schneider in. [indistinct chatter] Why am I dragged from place to place hotels, police departments, state department? I'm an American citizen. I insist on my rights! I've told you all I know. I will not be third-degreed! Sit down, Schneider. Sit down. All right, Phillips. Smoke? Don't worry. There's no third degree with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It's too bad. What's too bad? I'm astonished at you, Schneider. You keep sticking to that story. A man asked you to pick up that package a man you never saw before. It's true, that's all I know. (Renard) I expected more of you. It's the sort of story we hear every day the usual, obvious alibi of nitwits and common crooks. From a man of your caliber I would expect something ingenious cleverly contrived. Now look, Schneider. I'm one of the oldest operators of the FBI. I've had to deal with the most dangerous criminals in America. Hijackers, kidnappers, smugglers the most cunning international brains. And now, I am privileged to investigate the case of one of the most famous German spies in America. A spy who's shown tremendous daring imagination, ingenuity and yet who insists on pretending to be nothing but a stupid fool. I don't understand it. You, whose brain conceived and planned the kidnapping of Colonel Austin-- - Wha-- - Sit down, Sword. Sword? Why do you call me that? Oh, we've been reading Mary McLaughlin's correspondence between Germany and America for months. You, you read her mail? That's how we got your letter about hijacking the mobilization plans from Colonel Austin. But how did you know that the plans would be there just at that time? Well, I figured it out. It wasn't such a bad idea, was it? Oh, on the contrary, an excellent one if it hadn't been for our interference. Judging from your records you've had a most extraordinary career. No, go on. Help yourself. Shortly after you arrived from Germany you enlisted in the army. One year and eight months later, you deserted. Arrested, you served four months and five days - in federal military prison. - Correct. After your release you deserted again this time embezzling company funds. Oh... I couldn't stand those brass hats ordering me around. (Renard) So you decided to take up the career of a German espionage agent. Correct. But tell me, how did you happen to know that the Nazis wanted spies over here? Well, they've got hundreds of spies here. You know that, Mr. Renard. Oh, yes, of course, but how did you know? Why, everybody in the bunds knows that. (male narrator) For hours, Renard caters to Schneider's inflated vanity skillfully leading him on to give an account of his meetings with Nazi spy contacts of his success in obtaining secret military information of his brilliant plot to kidnap Colonel Austin of his wonderful plan to obtain blank passports. Many years' experience in dealing with every variety of criminal mentality enables Renard to be positive that his present suspect is a fairly common type of egomaniac one whose feeling of superiority to the general run of mankind is the direct cause of criminal tendencies one who can never be coerced into making a confession but who can be flattered into it. And so Renard continues praising Schneider agreeing with him pretending to consider him a mastermind until a full confession of Schneider's activities as a Nazi spy has been extracted. Oh, by the way we didn't quite cover the point of how you obtained the Z code. Mr. Renard, I am terribly tired. Come on. We know you didn't get it by yourself. Well, a friend of mine a man I had working for me but I don't want to drag him into it. Uh, was it the man who lives with you? Private Werner Renz? Yes. And the names of the man and woman who contacted you? - Hilda Kleinhauer. - And the man? Mr. Renard, y-you are putting me in an awkward spot-- Now, don't worry. You have nothing to fear. What's his name? Schlager. Franz Schlager. Where can I find them? I don't know, but every time the boat docks, they show up. What boat? The Bismarck. [instrumental music] Private Renz? - Yes, sir? - Are you Werner Renz? - Yes, sir. - You're under arrest. (male narrator) New York Harbor, Washington's birthday, 1938. German steamship Bismarck makes its routine stop at quarantine taking aboard the usual government customs, and immigration officials. But today, the customary staff includes two men who do not disclose their identity to the ship's officers. Here are the crew lists, gentlemen. Thank you. We'll check their landing passes. Thank you. Get your landing passes ready! - Hans Wiener. - Yes, sir. Ludwig Klausner. - Ludwig Klausner! - Yes, sir! (male #2) Heinrich Dempke. (crew) Here, sir. (male #2) Haslum Phelan. Uh, Franz Schlager. Did he sail? Franz Schlager. He didn't sail? No, Mr. Chambers. He isn't aboard. Why not? Any particular reason? No, no, nothing, sir, just that he's on leave. I see. Thank you. (male #2) Hilda Kleinhauer! Is this your first trip? No, sir. All right. Thank you, Miss Kleinhauer. Arnold Eppendauer. (crew) Yes, sir. Should we pick her up now? No, we'll get her in port. [foghorn blaring] - Hilda Kleinhauer? - Yes? Would you come with us, please? Why? Who are you? United States government officers Federal Bureau of Investigation. What do you want from me? What is it? I have never done anything against the United States government. That's just what we want to determine, Miss Kleinhauer. (Renard) Why didn't Schlager sail on this trip? I will complain to my German consul. Let me go back to my ship, please. I tell you, I don't know Schlager. But he's a regular member of the crew. Maybe, but the Bismarck's a big boat. There are hundreds in the crew. How about Kurt Schneider? Kurt Schneider? No. Please, I am telling you you have me confused with someone else. You visited Schneider's apartment together with Schlager on January 14th. You were present while they were discussing their espionage plans. You saw Schlager receive an envelope containing military information. You put that envelope in your purse. You left about 7:30. It's not true. It's all a lie. I advise you to tell the truth, Miss Kleinhauer. I do not know what you are talking about. I'm talking about a man you work with called Schlager the man you both contacted called Kurt Schneider. I do not know any Kurt Schneider. You have invented him. There is nobody like him! Hello, Miss Kleinhauer. Who is this woman, Schneider? Hilda Kleinhauer. She's Schlager's assistant. On January 14, did she visit your apartment - together with Schlager? - Correct. (Renard) You gave Schlager military information to take to Germany? - Correct. - Did you see her put those papers in her handbag? - Correct. - Thank you. That's all. Well, as you've seen, Miss Kleinhauer I haven't invented any of this at all. You still deny any knowledge of espionage activities? - I do. - Then surely you won't object to our examining your luggage aboard the Bismarck just as a matter of formality. No, I do not object. Go ahead, examine it. Then will you be good enough to write a letter to the purser instructing him to deliver your bags to us? - No, I will not. - All right. Then I'll merely have a warrant issued for their seizure. - You can do that? - Oh, naturally. New York Harbor's still very much a part of the United States. Well, uh, all right. I... I will give you the note but you will find nothing there. I am very sorry, gentlemen, how am I to know Miss Kleinhauer really wrote this note? Pardon me. You could have found it somewhere. No, we didn't find it. Oh, excuse me, please. I-I didn't know. All right, Heiser, show these gentlemen to Miss Kleinhauer's quarters. This way, please, gentlemen. Thank you. Hello? Give me the Cafe Nuremberg, quick. This your briefcase? Yes. You still don't know any Karl Schlager - or Kurt Schneider? - No. Both of them perfect strangers to you? Yes. I keep telling you I don't know any Franz Schlager. Oh, just a minute. You said Franz Schlager. How do you know his name is Franz? I, uh, you said it yourself just now. No, I said Karl Schlager, not Franz. And if I said the wrong name, so? No, you said the right name. It is Franz Schlager. Well, you've got me all mixed up. Well, that was my intention. Uh, by the way, have you a permit to take this money - out of Germany? - No. I understand it's a crime frequently punishable by death to smuggle money out of Germany. I did not smuggle it out. My government gave me that money to deliver-- To deliver? To whom? I-I forgot. Please, please, why don't you let me go? I have nothing more to say. I tell you, I'm innocent. Let me go back to my ship. What about this? Somebody put them there in my bag. Have you the key to these code letters? - No. - But you can decode them, - can't you? - No, no, I can't. I never saw them before. Go through the lining. Look in those perfume bottles. Phillips, search every one of those dressers. You have no right. My German consul will protect me! Here's something, Mr. Renard, I found it in the clock. (Hilda) It's not mine. I-I don't know anything about it. (Renard) Perhaps not. I demand to go back to my ship! Miss Kleinhauer, I'm afraid it's gonna be a long time before you can return to your ship. You may not realize it but you're in a very serious predicament. The only way you can help yourself is to help us. Well... what do you want me to do? (Renard) I want you to decode these letters immediately. [door buzzer buzzes] Dr. Kassell, please. I'm sorry. You can't see the doctor now. It's after office hours, and he's very tired. Oh, I believe Dr. Kassell will see me. What is your name, please? Edward Renard. Federal Bureau of Investigation. What do you want to see the doctor about? Oh, just tell him I'm here. He'll see me. Just a second please. There are two men to see you, doctor. They say they are from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Here now? Did you tell them I was in? - Yes, doctor, I-- - Oh. - When I leave, let them in. - Yes, doctor. Hello. Cafe Nuremberg. Otto. Get him for me at once. It's very important. Otto. Listen... Yes. Yes, I'll stop by sometime later and have a look at it. Yes. He should feel much better after his medicine, yes. All right. Goodbye. Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - Good evening. You wish to see me? Yes. Your nurse told you? Yes, gentlemen. What can I do for you? I just saw your commission outside, doctor. You're a reserve officer in the United States Navy? Yes, sir, I am. And one of the most active officers - of the German-American Bund. - That's right. That makes you keep constantly in close touch with Germany, doesn't it? Well, naturally. I'm very devoted to my fatherland. But I'm an American citizen first. Uh, doctor, I wonder if you'd give us the liberty of examining your office? Unless of course you wish to insist upon a warrant? No, no. Not at all. I have nothing to conceal. Thank you. All right, Phillips. Oh, by the way, do you happen to know Franz Schlager? No, sir. I do not. Hilda Kleinhauer? No, sir. Oh, uh, do you mind? - No. Please, go ahead. - Thank you. Oh, very interesting. - Biographies, eh? - Mm-hm. Some of the most important men in America. Yes, sir. Finance, mining, theater, doctors, statesmen, lawyers all classified according to blood and race. Yes, I see. Do you find it at all interesting? Oh, I do. Especially your own personal remarks on each case. They aren't exactly flattering. Well, naturally they are not. Traced back to the third and fourth generation. It's all done to preserve Americanism. It's a very thorough research, don't you think? Oh, yes. Your research is thorough enough but your facts seem to be all wrong. The story'd fit Nazi prejudice. Oh, uh, doctor you wouldn't exactly describe this type of research as the essence of Americanism, would you? I would. Precisely. In fact, it is as a loyal American that I am collecting this information since I am convinced that certain subversive elements must be removed from our American life before they totally corrupt and destroy our cherished democracy. Your democracy? Well, I don't know how you personally feel about these things, Mr. Renard but surely you must be aware of the insidious international conspiracy of desperate, subhuman criminals greedy for world power. It is obvious that these criminals need to be removed from public life before they are prepared to throw the entire world into flames. Careful, doctor, you might have burned yourself. Oh. I'm so sorry. An accident. That's quite alright, doctor. Mr. Renard, you are wasting your time. I know absolutely nothing about any spy plan nor about those code symbols on the matchbook there. My only contact with Schlager was for delivery of propaganda information. To Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels head of the German ministry of propaganda. Yet this information was proved to be delivered to Captain-Lieutenant Wilhelm Straubel of the German naval intelligence. But I'm not concerned with the mechanics of how my material reached Dr. Goebbels. And you deny that you know Hilda Kleinhauer Schlager's assistant. I never saw her in all my life. But you admit that you saw Schlager? Under the circumstances I just told you. Not as a spy. And this, uh, Hilda Kleinhauer. rather attractive girl. Reddish hair, dark eyes... I'm certain I never saw the girl you speak of. I-I don't know any such person. (Renard) Come in, Miss Kleinhauer. Can you identify this gentleman? Yes. Dr. Kassell. Is he the same man who gave you packages of spy information for delivery to Captain-Lieutenant Wilhelm Straubel? Yes. He is. It's a lie. It's not true. It is true, Dr. Kassell. I gave you nothing, I never saw you before. It is no use, doctor. They have the codes, the letters. Everything about you, too. Well, what do you say, doctor? Uh... Let me see, now. Oh, yes, yes, I-I remember her now. She came to my office once or twice with Schlager, but but it was not military information I gave him it was merely propaganda material. Tell the truth! It was only propaganda material I gave Schlager. No, doctor, I saw it. You gave Schlager military information. You stupid cow. - How do you dare-- - Sit down, Dr. Kassell. Alright, Miss Kleinhauer, thank you very much. Now, uh, about this military information that you gave Franz Schlager. I am not a fool, Mr. Renard. Merely because that stupid girl lied to you. That information concerned only the enemies of our party and our fuhrer. Your fuhrer? I thought you said you were a loyal American. I am. Sort of a contradiction in terms, isn't it? Loyalty to your fuhrer, loyalty to America? It may be to you. You don't understand. Well, frankly, doctor, I don't. [phone rings] Hello. Yes. Traced him to the Hotel Olympic. The register for the last year was signed four times. Twice in December. No, not alone. Uh, have photostatic prints made immediately. Yes, I'll be there. Oh, until late tonight. Uh, Dr. Kassell. You were once president of The Friends of New Germany before it became the German-American Bund by order of the Nazi Government. Yes, I was. But that's no violation of the law. Oh, certainly not. I was just inquiring. By the way, when did your wife sail for Europe last year? In December. And while you were a bachelor you lived constantly at your apartment? Of course. My office is adjoining. You never went to a hotel? No. Yet, on the register of the Hotel Olympic your name appears on four different occasions while your wife was away in Europe. How, how do you know that? We make it our business to know everything there is to know about a man before we bring him in for questioning. What do you want from me? I want you to tell me all you know about the German spy organization in this country. Alright. I'll tell you what I know. But remember, I am no spy. I only know these people because they carried propaganda material for me. (Renard) In short, Dr. Kassell, the German-American Bunds are indirectly connected through the ministry of propaganda with the ministry of war and the military naval intelligence. A network of interchangeable propaganda and espionage channels. Well, now it's beginning to make some sense. And just how extensive is this spy network, doctor? They have spies stationed in all of the navy yards in Brooklyn, in Philadelphia, in Newport News. There are German agents in the aeroplane and munitions factories at Bristol, Seattle, Boston, Buffalo. There's a spy base in Montreal, Canada. The chief United States inspector in one of your factories turning out secret aeroplane parts is a German spy. I want specific names and addresses all the details. Could I stop for a few minutes, please? I'm-I'm very tired. Oh, certainly. Perhaps some coffee? Thank you. Bring up some coffee and sandwiches. Go ahead, doctor. - Here he is. - Sit down. Oh. Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, doctor. What happened, Karl? Yes, what happened, doctor? Nothing serious. Nothing important. They merely heard I was active in the bund so they asked me a lot of silly questions. What about Kleinhauer and Schneider? Did they connect you with them? How they tried. But I denied I had ever seen them before. You told them nothing else? If I had, would I be here, free? I resent such insinuations, Hintze. Karl, you are sure there is no danger? Oh, absurd. There isn't the slightest danger. I assure you gentlemen, none of us has anything to fear, none of us. I hope so, for your sake. Goodnight, doctor. And keep in close touch with us. Come on, Hans. I will. Goodnight, gentlemen. (Lisa) Goodnight. And thank you. Tell me, Karl. What really happened? Trying to frighten me with their insinuations. But, Karl, how did they happen to let you go? - Hintze and Wildebrandt? - Yes. - You two are under arrest. - What does it mean? What for? Violation of the United States espionage laws. - Kassell! He betrayed us. - Get 'em in the car, come on. [engine rumbling] They think they can play cat and mouse with me. What if they should manage to get out somehow? Don't worry. I am working very close with United States government. Now, they'll keep me informed of all developments. Don't worry, Lisa. I know exactly what I'm doing.

Wire Schlager leaving Munich to report here at once. Have Gestapo instruct New York agents to protect all witnesses and defendants. Curious, how many arrests they have been able to make after Dr. Kassell was questioned. I suggest we have him come over here immediately. - What if he'll refuse? - Let him refuse. Have Gestapo bring Dr. Kassell to Germany as soon as possible. An urgent message from the general staff, sir. Thank you. (male narrator) March 13, 1938.

Karl, it's, oh, it's unbelievable. [indistinct] So gay and lightheart-- Erika, let's not worry about all that now. What I ask you is much more important to me. But, Karl, it will require so much money. I have sufficient money for a long time. And don't forget, I'm an able physician. I can make a new home and a good living anywhere. No, Karl. You go alone. [phone rings] Hello. No. Dr. Kassell is not home yet. Who's calling, please? Oh, how do you do, Mr. Renard? They are released on bail? Oh, how dreadful. Very dangerous. And will you also tell him that I advise moving to a hotel at once? Well, uh, preferably to my own hotel where I can be personally responsible for his safety. Yes, I'll tell him, Mr. Renard. Thank you very much. I'll tell him. Goodbye. [door opens] Good evening. Any news, Lisa? Karl, where have you been all day? - With Renard. - With Renard? Were you? Yes, just left him. Had a long talk with him a little while ago. A little while ago? Lisa, he tells me I'm in a very serious predicament and that I must leave town at once go away on a trip. For... for how long? Oh, indefinitely. At least until this investigation blows over. In any case, I will let you know wherever I stop and after a few weeks I send for you. Karl, that's not true. - Oh, Lisa. - You're lying. You want to go away with that woman. Don't be a fool. You don't realize how serious this is. It's that woman you want to go with you want to desert me, you want to leave me alone. Oh, stop it, Lisa, please. [phone rings] Yes? Who? Yes, I'll tell the doctor. - Yes. - Who was that? Karl, listen to me. Take me along with you. I know it's dangerous for you here. But you can't leave me alone - I am not young anymore. - I am not leaving you. I tell you, I'll send for you in two or three weeks. - Be sensible. - I won't give you up, Karl. I won't let that woman ruin my life after all these years together. - Take me with you. - No. Don't be a fool. I am leaving alone. Who telephoned now? It was Muller. Fritz Muller? His wife again? Yes, she's very ill. You must go over at once. Oh, it's you, doctor. Come in. I'm glad you got here so quickly. What happened to your wife, Muller? She seemed to be getting so much better, yesterday. Well, I don't know, doctor. Tonight, after dinner, she started complaining. - I see. - I really couldn't tell you what's the matter with her. Well, where is your wife, Muller? Where is she... How did you get... What are you doing here? Our government was kind enough to furnish bond for us. You overlooked the fact, Dr. Kassell that American laws are very generous to prisoners. Well, I'm very glad to see you free. You are? Well, of course, but... Why this deception? Why didn't you come to my house instead? We didn't want to disturb you, Dr. Kassell as we did once before. Well, what do you want from me? Dr. Kassell, you are going back to Germany tonight. To Germany? What is this? A trap? Let me out of here at once! What? Listen. You know I can't go back. I-I'll pay you anything, I have money. Please. Please, give me another chance. Please. I'll do anything you say. I promise you, I-I'll do anything you want me to do I really didn't know what I was doing. Informer. No, no, I will not go back to Germany. They'll put me in a concentration camp. They'll torture me! They will, doctor. Please, I'll give you everything I have. I am a rich man. Take it all. Please, let me go. Please. Please. - Please. - Go ahead, Wildebrandt. No! Don't! Don't! Let's get him to the boat. [dramatic music] He went alone to see this patient in Greenwich Village? No, I went with him. What happened then? On the way back, he decided to stop off and visit a friend who's leaving on the Bismarck. - What time was that? - About one o'clock. And yet you didn't notify us until this morning. I was not worried until this morning. Many times, he does not come home until very late. Have you any reason for wanting your husband to go back to Germany? I love my husband. I want him to be where it is best for him. Order a coast guard seaplane. Radio up on the captain of the Bismarck to stand by to surrender Kassell. I'll be at the airport in 30 minutes. Yes? Captain Richter speaking. What? Department of Justice? Yes. I'll see. Just a moment, please. They're askin' for that man. Tell them that you refuse to stop the ship on the high seas as the weather is bad and you will endanger the lives of the passengers. Hello. New York? All ready, Mr. Renard. Thank you. Mr. Renard! Mr. Renard! - What is it? - Your office just called. The captain of the Bismarck refuses to surrender your man. He says it's unsafe to stop the ship on the high seas. I see. Phillips, call the state department right away. Have them cable the United States Consul in Cherbourg to pick up Kassell when the Bismarck docks there. - Right. - Thank you. (male narrator) Acting on orders from the Gestapo ship's officials refused to surrender Dr. Kassell at Cherbourg. And when the Bismarck docks in Germany this time the delegation to welcome Kassell consists of Captain-Lieutenant Straubel a squad of black-shirted SS men and a Dr. Krogman one of the many legal advisers attached to the German foreign ministry. Why am I treated like this? I haven't done anything. I-I... I can explain. I must be given a hearing. There's nothing to be alarmed about, Dr. Kassell. We do not intend to harm you. You don't intend to harm me? On the contrary we'll take very good care of you. All we ask is that you publicly deny any incriminating statements you may have made. Is... is that all? One more thing. Dr. Krogman is leaving on this ship for New York tomorrow. 'He will have an American attorney come to Germany' 'to take down a deposition from you.' You will charge the FBI agents with using coercion and intimidation forcing you to sign a false confession. I see. Yes, you are right. That's what they did. They tortured me. Yes, of course. And you will swear to it. I swear to everything. Will I be able to go now? Not yet. You will be held on a technical charge of entering Germany without a passport. Is that correct, Dr. Krogman? Yes. For how long? A week. Perhaps two. When you are released, however it does not mean that you are free to leave the country. I-I understand. So you see, Dr. Kassell? You have nothing to worry about for the present. I see. Go ahead, Dr. Kassell. (Krogman) I demand that you release this Kleinhauer woman at once. You've only recently arrived from Germany - haven't you, Dr. Krogman? - Yes. Well, just what is your official status? My credentials are available. I didn't come here to discuss them. I demand again that this woman be released. Well, you make this demand in the name of the German government? Absolutely. Your government assumes full responsibility for this woman? Yes, as it does for any German citizen. And furthermore, unless she's promptly released serious difficulties affecting the relations of our two countries can be expected. Dr. Krogman, I have no authority to release this woman. Also, I would like to remind you that this is the United States of America. We don't know what to do with ultimatums here. You'll see someone in the state department. Perhaps they will be able to help you. I want it to be a matter of record that I warned you. Yes, it's a matter of record. You may rest assured that-- Show the gentleman out, please. My government will hear of this. Goodbye, Dr. Krogman. Is he crazy? Doesn't he realize the German government practically admits complicity by openly defending Hilda Kleinhauer? And furthermore, I warned them of serious international repercussions unless she is immediately released. Yes. Yes? Yes. Oh, I beg your pardon. Yes, Your Excellency. You, you are absolutely right. I only thought it... Yes, your... I-I mean, no, Your Excellency. Yes, Your Excellency. I understand perfectly. The government does not wish to be identified with this case. I will find a lawyer who has never been identified with the German government to defend Hilda Kleinhauer. Yes, Your Excellency. Yes, Your Excellency. [door unlocks] Thank you. How do you do, Miss Kleinhauer? I'm Krogman. Dr. Julius Krogman. Will you please sit down? I am to obtain an attorney for you. Now, don't worry. No jury will convict you when you tell them how you were terrorized into signing a false confession. - But I-- - No sleep for days, no food. Promises of release if you signed. Every despicable trick of the most barbarous third degree was used on you until you had no strengths left to resist. - But that is not-- - I know you're afraid to speak. You needn't be now. Tell the truth. That is your defense, you understand? And the truth is that you were forced into signing a false confession dictated to you by the FBI You will make sure your attorney understands this. - Do you think it will work? - Shh! Be careful of your choice of words! You mean to say, "Will the truth save you?" - I say it will. - Then when will I be released? Immediately after the trial. Why must I stay here until then? My bail isn't much. The German government-- Miss Kleinhauer please bear this in mind. The German government has nothing whatsoever to do with yours or anyone else's activity. Well, goodbye, Miss Kleinhauer. Thank you very much. [door closes] Yes. I see. What are you going to do? Answer all questions and tell the truth. - Now go on home, dear. - Oh, please, I want to wait. You can't wait in the witness room. It'll only make me nervous to have you waiting around the corridors. Please go on. I'll come home as soon as I can. Alright. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, Anna. And don't worry. [indistinct chatter] [intense music] Hello. Coast guard? Uh, what time did the Donstadt sail last night? Oh, thank you. Put in a call to Washington, the state department, right away. (male narrator) The state department instructs the United States Ambassador to Great Britain to make every effort to take Westphal off the Donstadt when she docks at Southampton. You gentlemen are from the United States embassy? Yes. We've come to get Mr. Westphal. I'm sorry, but Mr. Westphal is very ill. You refuse to comply with the request of the United States government concerning an American citizen? Not at all, Mr. Westphal has the right to do what he wishes, but he is very ill. - Could we see him? - Certainly. This way, please. Please leave me alone. I told you I can't go with you. I'm very, very sick. Can't-can't you see? But you realize the government asked you to return only to finish your testimony. I'm very, very sick, don't you understand? I can't leave the boat. I'm very sick. Yes, very sick. Please go away. [dramatic music] Your Honor, Mr. Foreman ladies and gentlemen of the jury you have been selected to determine the guilt or innocence of 18 individuals accused of violating the espionage laws of the United States of America. four of these eighteen are in custody at the present time. The defendants Kurt Schneider, twice a deserter from the United States Army, Werner Renz private in the united states air corps Hilda Kleinhauer, former beauty operator on the steamship Bismarck and Max Helldorf, technician employed by the Zenith Munitions Corporation of New Jersey. In simple language, the indictment means that this group of defendants conspired to secure secret information about our national defense and to transmit this information to the advantage of a foreign government, namely Germany. [crowd clamoring] Order! Order! Order! Order! I wish to make it perfectly clear that this conspiracy was conceived in and operated directly by the present German government. [crowd clamoring] Order! I shall request the public to refrain from any demonstration of emotion or partiality in this court of justice. Proceed. It has been suggested that the roles of these four defendants are inconsequential. That is true. But therein lies their precise value. They are persons of unimportance. They have been but little cogs in the vast and intricate machine a worldwide spy network whose organized efficiency leaps all oceans and boundaries a vicious network whose complex fabric weaves inevitably through the naval intelligence offices in Bremen and Hamburg through many German-American organizations here through the war and propaganda ministries in Berlin through the inner sanctums of present Germany's highest officialdom. (male narrator) Nuremburg, Germany, September 12 addressing 180,000 Nazi party leaders Fuhrer Adolf Hitler whips them into maniacal frenzy hurling war threats and ultimatums against all democracies and their last Central European Bulwark, Czechoslovakia. Resorting to its favorite device of stirring up racial prejudices and national hatreds fomenting riots and disorder the Nazi juggernaut sets the stage for Hitler's invasion again on the pretext of restoring order. The democratic republic of Czechoslovakia modeled on the constitution of the United States starts its tragic journey toward oblivion by falling into the hands of the new master of Europe, Adolf Hitler. A man whose battle cry is "We Germans throughout the world." And the democracies are given still another illustration of the supremacy of organized propaganda backed by force. Our power increases from day to day. All of Europe is at our mercy on its knees begging us not to destroy it. Austria is part of greater Germany. Czechoslovakia is screwed. Italy is with us, and safeguards Yugoslavia. Japan is our ally. Hungary is practically ours. Our agents are succeeding in Romania Poland, and Lithuania. France will soon be isolated from all sides. But now, since our glorious victory at Munich all our efforts must be directed at the strongest remaining democracy the United States. Here we must repair the few petty mistakes that have recently been made. In order to dominate completely the countries of South America all excellent markets for our manufactured goods all superb sources of raw materials we must paralyze the influence of the United States by using every instrument of propaganda at our command by knowing every military and naval secret it possesses. (Kellogg) It has also been suggested that the information these defendants have obtained for Germany is of small moment. But as we have endeavored to bring out during the course of this trial we have only scratched the surface of the Nazi espionage network. We cannot calculate the extent of this spy ring that has penetrated every nerve and tissue of this nation. Together with this propaganda and religious hatred. Here on this chart, we can see the amazing system of sinister forces at work in this country. And realize the dangers to which our government is subjected. If you will examine its structure you would be convinced that these dangers, if they continue represent the most serious menace to our national defense. But there are some who will say there's nothing to fear. That we are immune. That we are separated by vast oceans from the bacteria of aggressive dictatorships and totalitarian states. But we know and have seen the mirror of history in Europe this last year. The invasions of Poland, Norway and Denmark by Nazi Germany, Russia and Finland's invasion by Communist Russia are still fresh in our mind. These peaceful nations have their entire national structure eaten away by the boring of the enemies within who by treachery, treason, and corruption pave the way for the ruthless march of the Nazi iron boot into these countries. [dramatic music] Peace-loving Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg became the next victims of Nazi aggression. Trojan horses and fifth-column bundists in these countries threw off their masks and stabbed these countries in the back while the wanton Nazi war machine attacked in the front. [music continues] German parachute troops dropping like a plague of locust from the skies over Holland were met by Nazi fifth columnists in Rotterdam, The Hague, and Amsterdam and directed to vital points of attack. Important railway stations and bridges were blown up by members of the fifth column to prevent Holland and Belgium from sending help to their beleaguered soldiers. [music continues] God alone only knows what peace-loving nation will be next. Let us take a lesson from the deadly parallel of the Nazi fifth-column activities abroad and here. Working insidiously through its bundists training camps where spies take cover and where it diligently trains its youth to seize power. But ladies and gentlemen, America is not simply one of the remaining democracies. America is democracy. Democracy that has the God-given inspiration of free men determined to defend forever the liberty which we have inherited in our bill of rights of the constitution of the United States. [cheering and applause] [gavel pounding] (judge) 'Order!' And that these defendants had been convicted of espionage against the military establishment's of Germany I believe their fate would be more fearful than that which here awaits them. These natives of a totalitarian state are to enjoy the mercies of a democracy and they may deem themselves indeed fortunate that a court of a government to which they were disloyal is fully prepared to stand between them and the full vengeance of the law. In this country we spread no sawdust upon the surface of our prison yards. Extra, Nazi spies sentenced. Extra, read all about it! You doing fine, old Bill? Okay, Jimmy. Read all about the big Nazi spy case. - Paper, mister? - Alright, son. Thanks, mister. Extra, read all about the big Nazi spy case! Extra! Tired? Very... I'm glad it's all over. Funny thing working on a case like this for so long something like spending a great deal of time going through a mad house. You see these Nazis operating here and you think of all those in Germany. You can't help feeling somehow that they're... ...well, absolutely insane. As a matter of fact, you begin to doubt your own sanity. True. We see what's happening in Europe. We know what they're trying to do here. It all seems so unreal. Fantastic, uh... Well, like an absurd nightmare. Absurd... when you think of its potential menace it's terrifying. I don't think, Renard, that kind of people are going to have much luck in this country. It's true, we're a careless, easygoing, optimistic nation. When our basic liberties become threatened, we wake up. - Have some more coffee, gents? - Yes, please. Just half a cup, please. You fellas read in the paper, they sentenced those Nazi spies? Yes, we've heard all about it. The nerve of those Nazis, sending spies to this country. Running those bundists camps. Trying to stir up the same kind of trouble here they're making in Europe. - Hello, Bill. - How are you, Tom? I see those Nazis finally got what was coming to them. Yeah, we were just talking about it. There's one thing they found out here, though this ain't Europe. (Tom) That's right, Bill, and the sooner we show 'em that, the better. Sure, we'll show 'em. - The voice of the people. - Thank God for such people. Yes, thank God. [instrumental music]
