[MAN SPEAKING ARABIC] [CROWD YELLING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [CROWD CHANTING] ♪ -Hi, Mary Lynn. -Hi. Great game today. Well, thanks. I don't think the football team could survive without you. You're the best quarterback they've ever had. Dingle! [LAUGHING] Do you think you could survive without me, Mary Lynn? No, Doug, I just meant that... I don't know. I just don't think they could survive... [MIMICS GAGGING] Just let me puke and get it over with. -Hi. -Jenny. Is that fine. Hey, need help with your books? Get lost. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hey, nice move! So, when are we gonna go out, Jennifer? -When hell freezes over. -[CHUCKLES] She likes me. [STRUMMING ROCK TUNE] [LAUGHING] [BELL RINGING] Take a load off, buddy. Take a load off. Oh, man. You know, you sounded like heaven. -You sound like you need a new set of strings. -[CHUCKLES] I hear that. Oh, no, Gus, I couldn't. Come on. I already owe you for the guitar. You don't owe someone for a birthday present. I know, but... No "buts". You go buy yourself a set of strings, little Johnny. We've got a lot of music to make. Okay, I understand. Well, I gotta hit the trail. You take it easy. You take it easy. I hear you. [GRUNTS] See you later, Gus. We all in? Well, let me say, I'm just as thrilled to be in this detention hall as you are. For the next 90 minutes, I expect you to sit still and silently read a book. Then we can all go home. Has anyone seen Mr. Dylan? Yeah, he's here. Where? [GUITAR STRUMMING] Very nice, Segovia. That will be all, Mr. Dylan. Would you mind unplugging the noise box and putting the musical instrument as far away from you as possible? No sooner said than done. Thank you. Mr. Dylan, your feet are on the chair, not on the floor. Nice threads, baby. You look terrific. Thank you. Mr. Dylan, feet on the floor. Floor! You are skating on thin ice, Mr. Dylan. I can always extend our time together. All right. Books open, mouths shut. Now! I shall return in five minutes. I expect peace and silence to prevail in my absence. Feet, Dylan! So long, bonehead! [CHUCKLING] Doug, I don't know how we got stuck in this detention. I was just minding my own business and out of nowhere, Mr. Nero just came up from behind me... -Whatever, Mary Lynn. -[GUITAR STRUMMING] So, Jennifer, tell me, how did you wind up in this sinful place? I think it was a case of mistaken identity. JOHNNY: Jennifer, you like guitar? You sound pretty good, Johnny. So, you like music, huh? Check this out. [MIMICS FARTING] -Doug, stop! -[LAUGHING] What did I do to deserve this? Would you cut it out? No, this is amazing. He's only 17 and already the biggest asshole in Indiana. [JENNIFER LAUGHS] WOMAN: And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight to the knees. Here we go for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight, hit the floor. -And one... -Oh, yeah. Yeah. Six, seven, eight, nine. Here we go. Press, eight, seven, press, six, five, four, three, keep going, two, one, again. Yeah! Yeah. Jennifer. Jennifer. What do you say I walk you home after prison lets out? I don't think so. Hey, come on. It can be dangerous for a young girl to walk home all alone. So you're going to protect me from all the maniacs and killers -just waiting to pounce on me? -Yeah. They're everywhere. I'll serenade you. I'll think about it. Three, two and one. Okay, everyone. Wasn't that fun? Don't go away. We'll be right back after this message. Does your dog have bad breath? You should be using Canine Gargle. It's good for you and good for... MAN: We interrupt our regular programming for this special news bulletin. This new salvo of Libyan threats to avenge the American bombings has prompted government officials to beef up security in all sensitive military installations here and abroad. [SIRENS WAILING] Locally, at the Black River Nuclear Power Plant, new measures have been taken to assure that an incident... Dingle! Turn that off. This is a detention hall, not a video arcade. Moammar, how are you feeling? Good. You must drive as fast as you possibly can. And when you're 300 meters from the reactor building, turn on the timing device. Yassir, I want to do it! Hassan, be patient! Your time will come. Moammar is the chosen one for this mission. There is much more to be accomplished. This is only the beginning. Now, you must drive all the way to the reactor building or we have failed. I will not fail you, Yassir. Nothing can stop me. [SPEAKING ARABIC] Go in the name of God. God is with us. I think it'd be a great idea. Shit! Look out! [LAUGHING] Damn it! [SIRENS WAILING] Go, go, go! Come on! Go! -WOMAN: Thank you. -You're welcome. MAN ON RADIO: Attention all units, code 1, code 1. Terrorist attack at Black River Nuclear Power Plant. Suspects are heading eastbound on Route 22. Security police are in pursuit. Leroy, give me that again. Over. Chief, is that you? You're damn right it's me. I have Captain Steiner on channel 68. Over. Chief, we've just been attacked by three suspects in a blue Ford sedan. They just shot two rockets at the power plant. Also knocked down the front gate. They're headed east on Route 22 and they're headed in your direction. Damn it. Attention all units, I want a roadblock on Route 22. Everybody move to intercept blue Ford sedan. Occupants heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Over. [SIREN WAILING] [SIRENS WAILING] Officer checking in. [GUNFIRE] They what? Damn it, Tom. Wait a minute. I see them! They're coming this way. Holy Christ! Son of a bitch. [SIREN WAILING] [SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT MURMURING] [ALL CLAMORING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Damn. [BABBLING] [SCREAMING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Units five and six, they're heading east on Main just past Richmond Avenue. I'm going around to head them off. I want backup. [SIREN WAILING] This is Unit two on Jefferson, heading north. ETA five minutes. This is Unit 5. I'm in the alley between Morgan and North. No sign of suspects. OFFICER ON RADIO: Unit 8. Negative contact. Will continue searching. 10-4 Units 5 and 8. Continue search. This is Unit 5. Have suspects spotted. Will pursue and intercept at Main Street. OFFICER ON RADIO: I see them, Chief. They're headed south on Main Street. Okay, move up. We're gonna box them in. Proceed with caution. [INDISTINCT YELLING] Crazy kids! [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Up ahead, Yassir. [SIRENS WAILING] Shit! [SIREN WAILING] Don't stop now. Just a little bit more. Come on, four more. Three, two and one. We interrupt our regular programming for this special news bulletin. We have just received a preliminary report that a commando style terrorist attack has occurred at the Black River Nuclear Power Plant in Kokomo, Indiana. Now details are sketchy at the moment but we understand that heavy artillery is involved and at least two rockets have been fired. -MR. NERO: Dingle! -[GASPS] Mr. Nero, you don't understand. Terrorists are attacking Indiana! [ALL LAUGHING] -That's a good one, Dingle. -Far out! No, really! Listen. Listen. Yes, now you, too, can have the perfect rear end that you've always dreamt about with Joe Farino's Miracle Butt Buster. Dingle, you can plan on detention for the rest of the semester. But I just heard the man... Look, if you think you can get away with this kind of behavior in this room, you're very sadly mistaken. -Please, listen to me. I heard... -Sit down. Sit down! And as for the rest of you... Let me tell you something, I am fed up with your behavior. Terrorists in Indiana? I have never heard of such a ridiculous thing in my life. Units 2 and 3, units 2 and 3, where are you? Going north on Main. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] WOMAN 1: Get a blanket! WOMAN 2: Help! [SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] [CAR HORN BLARING] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [WOMEN SOBBING] Dear Jesus. I want emergency vehicles downtown right away. Call the FBI. We've got a war on our hands. [TIRES SCREECHING] [BELL RINGING] [SIRENS WAILING] All right, let's shake it. What do we got here? MAN: We got a vehicle in the downtown area. Ran over some old man down there. What kind of weapons? MAN: Automatic. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I hear they're real badass. Let's go. Let's shake it. Let's go, on the double. Five rifles, two shotguns. Let's go. Load up. Check your weapons. Chief, this is Steiner here. We're on our way. Over. Ya'll checked out? Let's go. Load. Let's go. -[ENGINE STARTING] -Hit it. [TRAIN HORN HONKING] [SIRENS WAILING] Units 2 and 3, we're racing a freight train up a utility road. Try to intercept at Brown Street crossing. Repeat, intercept at Brown Street crossing. Out. -[BELL DINGING] -[HONKING] OFFICER: I swear I don't know how it happened. Don't give me that. They were heading north on Brown Street. They didn't just disappear into thin air. I'm on Brown Street, Chief. What the hell are you doing over there? You told me. Never mind. Leroy, this is Chief Rawlings, do you read me? Over. I read you, Chief. Over. Where the hell are those damn terrorists? The suspects were just spotted heading northbound on Route 35. Over. All right. Keep me posted. Over and out. 10-4. See anyone behind us? No, I don't see anyone. [SIGHS] -What is that? -[CHOPPER WHIRRING OVERHEAD] Faster. Move faster. -Move faster. -I'm trying. This is as fast as possible. What do you expect? It is a car, not a rocket. [CHEERING] OFFICER OVER RADIO: Suspects spotted at West 31. Look. Move quicker. Shoot! Fire! [GUNFIRE] Fire! Look out! [GUNFIRE] [TIRES SCREECHING] Gamal, I need some ammo. Let me out here. I'll hold them back. Allah be with you. [SIREN WAILING] Go! Go! [SIREN WAILING] [EXPLOSION] We've had so much fun today. It's a shame that we have to go. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Goodbye. Bye. See you tomorrow. Dingle! Let me have it. What? Oh, this? I wasn't watching television, Mr. Nero. I was, um... I was using the computer for my math homework, and... Dingle, don't press your luck. One more time, and that little TV will spend the rest of the semester with me. [STUDENTS CHUCKLING] Miss Dubois. Miss Dubois, please get rid of the chewing gum now. Thank you very much. Mr. Dylan? Mr. Dylan? Please open both eyes, put both feet down on the floor and read a book. I don't have a book. Oh, you don't have a book? Sitting in a room surrounded by books, but you don't have one. Perhaps I can make a suggestion. Perhaps I can find a book for you. This, Mr. Dylan, is an American history textbook. And in case you've never seen the inside of one of these, I can assure you you'll be fascinated with its contents. [STUDENTS LAUGHING] All right, don't move! Hands up! Hands up in the air! Listen, don't... Don't hurt anyone. Shut up! All right. Hands down. Slowly. Hands down! You, sit down. Hands on the desk! -Are you a school teacher? -Yes. You keep students quiet, and no one will get hurt. Right. Now, is there anybody else in the building right now? No. This is... School's out. -This is a detention hall where... -Detention hall? Oh, yes. Yes, a detention hall. We keep the students after school. It's a sort of punishment. I know! This is how you punish students in your country. -That's right. In America, we don't... -That's enough! Now, we're here to avenge your government's bombing of our country. We're not here to hurt students. Yassir, what do we do now, damn it? We need another car. -I have a... -Don't move! -I have a car. I... -Slowly. Get up! The keys are in my pocket. Here. The car's in the parking lot. Take my car, please. Sit down. Slowly. All right. [YELLS INDISTINCTLY] [SIRENS WAILING] Leroy, anything new from Unit 3? Over. Chief, we lost them at the intersection of Coast Road. Over. Have they turned down Coast Road? It's possible. Over. Damn! Come on! Let's get out of this stinky place. We have to do something about our car. Who cares about the car? Why don't you camel jockeys get lost, so we can go home? Johnny, shut up! Since you are so brave, then you will be our hostage. I'm not going anywhere with you. You stink. [JENNIFER SCREAMS] Don't move. Don't move! -Please, don't hurt him. -Shut up! [GUS PLAYING HARMONICA] -[GUNFIRE] -[SCREAMING] Gus! You said there was nobody else in the building! I didn't know. I didn't know. What are you doing? Don't move! -I just wanted to cover the... -Shut up! Now, listen to me. All of you. The next one to make a move is dead. Is that understood? Yes. Have all units converge on Hoosier High School. I found him. OFFICER: Attention all units. Suspects have been spotted at Hoosier High School. All units respond. Code 3. You and you. Both of you, come with us. -Me? -Yes! Let's go! Stay down! [SIRENS WAILING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] They've got us trapped in this stinky place. Gamal, stay calm. How are we going to get home? There is a way we can get out of here. Attention! This is Police Chief Rawlings. We have you completely surrounded. Come out with your hands up. How do we even know they're inside? We can't take any chances. If they are inside, they may have hostages, school kids, teachers, who knows. I repeat, this is Chief Rawlings. You are surrounded. You have five minutes to come out with your hands up. It's over for you. You are going to die young, bastard. -Gamal! Please! -Do you know that? Listen to me. Come! Listen to me. Gamal! Gamal! I have a plan. It will work out to our advantage. What do you mean? They're not shooting at us. Do you not wonder why they're not shooting at us? Because of the students. Yes. We have hostages. And as long as we have hostages, we are in complete control. But how are we going to get out of this place? It is very simple, my friend. We take all the students home with us. I can send some men around the back, up on the roof. Just hold your horses, Captain. We don't even know what we're up against. If they're not in there, we'll find out soon enough. You now have two minutes to come out with your hands up. You have one minute. I repeat, you have one minute to come out with your hands up. Hey, Chief Rawlings. Listen to me. We have many hostages in here. School children. Do exactly as I say, and no one will get hurt. Damn it! Stay back! No one comes near this building, or I will kill the hostages. Now listen to me very carefully. I want a bus backed up to the front door. And a jet waiting at the airport. Full gas tanks! Is that understood? No tricks and no surprises. Do you understand me? Okay, okay, we'll do our best. Just don't hurt anybody. You have 30 minutes. No more! Or you will be crying over many dead bodies. And get rid of that helicopter! If I see it again, I will make sure that this will be a day to remember. For all of you. Get on the radio and make sure that helicopter stays the hell out of here. Yes, sir. -Are you listening? -Okay, okay, take it easy. We'll stay clear out of sight. Just don't hurt anyone. Listen. Think we can move him out of the room? The girls are upset. There's no use leaving him here. -We could get... -Quiet! Talk too much. All right. It's all right, Gamal. Move the body. [SIGHS] You must understand. We wish you no harm. We only want the world to know of our struggles for freedom. We do not want war. When your government bombed our homes and killed our children, you left us very little choice. We fight back only to defend ourselves. Sometimes, your government fails to understand that. But these are just school children. They've got nothing to do with your political problems. Your bombs killed our children. And soon, your troops attack us. These very same children will be more than willing to kill us. We have no quarrel with you. Your country was bombed because of your terrorism. This is not true. Your government has given you the wrong information. We are peace-loving people! Enough of this! I don't have to debate politics with you. I still think we should deploy some men on the roof. We can go behind the building, position ourselves there. Now you listen to me, Captain. I'm not gonna risk any more lives if I can help it. Those God damn terrorist near destroyed my town and killed a lot of innocent people. I don't know how many of them are in that building or how they're deployed, but until the FBI gets here, I am running the show. Have you got that? Okay, Chief. It's your ball game. We got a jet for those cutthroats? -I'll check on it. -Get going. Write all your names on a piece of paper. All of you. Come on! What's this for? Never mind. Just write your name down. I know we can wear them down. We'll delay them as long as we can. What's the story on the FBI? -They're on their way. -BROWN: Chief? We've got a school bus. Good. Get ready to move it up at the last possible moment. Right. Maybe we could bug the bus. Steiner, this ain't Mission: Impossible. We don't have much of a call for electronic surveillance around here. Uh, Chief, no offense, but do you have much experience in dealing with hostage situations? Yeah, I saw Dog Day Afternoonthree times, and I watch the Mediterranean circus on the TV news every night. [SIGHS] Never mind. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Hello in there. I'd like to talk. YASSIR: What is it? I'd like to know your name. No names. I'll tell you what. When we get the bus here, I'll trade you the bus for a hostage. What do you say? No deals. You have 24 minutes. Now, wait a minute. We need a little more time. You have 23 minutes, Chief. Dog Day Afternoon? It worked in the movie. Excuse me. What is it? Can we just let the girls go? They're frightened, and there's no need to keep them here. -We can just... -Be quiet. Listen, I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to him. -[GRUNTS] -Stop it! Quiet, or you will get the same. Leave her alone, dirtball! [SCREAMS] Gamal! Take it easy! Gamal! Come on! That's not necessary. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] They call us names. They have no respect for us. You students are truly ignorant of our people and our motives. Listen to me. All of you. You're in a very dangerous situation. Each and every one of you. If you do not cooperate with us, your lives are in great danger. And remember, I will not hesitate to kill you. Is that understood? What is it? I have to go to the bathroom. [SIGHS] All right. Go ahead. Gamal will go with you. I'll hold it. Deputy, can you tell us what's going on in there? I can't answer that. All right, listen, your guess is as good as mine. Now listen, folks, you're gonna have to move back. Jerry, get in here! As soon as we have something, the Chief will let you know. I can't answer that. I have no idea, sir. As soon as we have something, we'll let you know. All right? As soon as we have something. [SIGHS] And the location's Hoosier High School. -OFFICER: 10-4... -Chief, I just spoke to the governor, he promised to have a jet waiting at the airport. Good work. Man, we're getting all sorts of flak from the press. Everybody wants to know what's going on. You tell them we've got nothing to say. They're pretty insistent. I don't give a damn. Those terrorists have a radio. I don't want them to hear anything they don't already know. What are you gonna do with us? They're gonna pick a name and kill one of us. Like they did on that ship, the Achille Lauro. Would you shut up, or I'll kill you right now. Stop! [GUNFIRE] Hold your fire. No shooting. On the floor! Come on, move it! Move! Hurry up! You, move forward, right there. Come on! Stay on the floor. Don't move. [GUNFIRE] Hey, what's going on in there? Hey, talk to me or we're coming in! Everything's fine! No one's hurt! How do I know that? You have my word! It was just a warning. Everything's fine! Let's go in. No, we wait. Chief, let's move in, they may be killing those kids! If we start shooting, those kids don't have a chance. Please don't kill us. Be quiet, no talking! Hey, Chief! You better hurry up with that bus! Those bastards have got us by the balls. Should we bring the bus up now? No. I want confirmation from the airport that we've got a jet waiting on the runway. We might be better off if we can get 'em out of the building, onto the bus! As soon as we get the jet, Captain. As soon as we get the jet. Hey, listen up. The bus is coming, just don't hurt anyone, okay? Everything in here is fine! Should be more careful. I almost shot you. What did you want me to do, knock? -Where are the two boys? -I don't know. You don't know? What do you mean you don't know? I don't know, I lost them in the halls. Are they still in the building? Maybe. I don't know! That's not good, Gamal. Not good at all! What do you want from me? All right, all of you, back in your seats! Move it! Come on, move, up! You're very foolish people. If you attack us or try to escape again, we'll kill all of you. Do I make myself clear? MR. NERO: Yes. You all have families, right? You? -Yes. -Have any children? I had a daughter. Two years old. Killed by you. If you want to see your families again, you will do exactly as I say. Is that understood? Johnny, wait! Rest. We just can't keep running in circles. We might just run right back into them. Oh, come on. We can get out right through there. Wait a minute, where are you going? I'm getting the hell out of this freak show! -You just can't leave! -Watch me! Johnny! You've got a problem? We've got to do something. They have got machine guns. We just can't leave the others behind. You know, for a smart guy, you are acting stupid! Now, I am leaving and I suggest you follow. What about Gus? They killed Gus in cold blood, Johnny. He was your best friend! Well, what do you want me to do? I can't bring him back to life! We've got to help the others, Johnny! Look, I have got two hands, that is it! -Do you have any guns? -No. Yeah, me neither. Now, let's go. Wait a minute, I've got an idea. Let me show you something, okay? This better be good. -Hey! Stop! Sit down in that chair! -Stop it! Please, just... Stop your whining. Look, I was just trying to see if the boy's all right. He's all right, still breathing. [SOBBING SOFTLY] [WHISPERING INAUDIBLY] -You! -Sit down in your chair, now! Go and sit down. Would you shut up? Shut up! Big, brave man. GAMAL: Shut up! [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Captain, come here. What's with the FBI? I just spoke with them, they're on their way. That's what they said 20 minutes ago. Try and get me the governor on your radio, would you? What's the situation on the road to the airport? It's good, Chief. We have got every access road blocked. Good. Make sure that all units stays in contact with us. Chief, I've got the governor. Governor, if I don't have a jet in... Well, that's great, sir. That's good to hear. Yes, sir, I'll be in touch. Goodbye, Governor. What'd he say? We got our jet. Now, let's see if we can move those people out of there. Chief, why don't you give Dog Day another shot? -What do you mean? -Try a little negotiating, maybe get a hostage out of the deal. Okay, I'll give it another try. Hey! Hello in there! -What is it, Chief? -I've got good news. We've got a jet waiting for you at the airport. But first I'm going to need some proof that all the hostages are okay. The hostages are fine. I need proof, how do I know you haven't killed everybody? They're fine! I told you they're fine! Where is my bus? You give us a hostage, we'll give you the bus. No deals! I told you, no deals! You have eight minutes, Chief! I want a hostage. You. Get out. Mary Lynn! I said, get out! Go! Go! Sights. -There, there, Mary Lynn. -[SOBBING] It's okay now, honey. You're safe. Everything's going to be all right. You go with Officer Sights, I'll be with you in a minute, okay? All right. See if you can calm her down, I want to ask her some questions as soon as possible. Right, Chief. Should we bring up the bus? -In a couple... -YASSIR: Hey, Chief! You have your hostage. Where is my bus? It's coming, it's coming! You have six minutes! [BEEPING] [WHIRRING] -Look, I'm leaving. -Just wait a minute! Just a little longer. Voila. What are you going to do with that? Come on, you'll see. Norman, are you fucking out of your mind? We've got a weapon! Yeah, well, I ain't no Robin Hood! They are going to blow your brains out. No, this will work! I know it. I'm out of here. It's worth a try! Later. Don't go, Johnny! It might work. -[SOBBING] -It's all over now. There was blood all over the place. Mary Lynn, here's Chief Rawlings, he just wants to ask you a few questions, okay? Okay. All right, now, Mary Lynn. Look, sweetheart, you're going to help me see that nobody else gets hurt, okay? -Okay. -All right? Now, first, how many terrorists are in there? Three or two... All right. And how many hostages does he have? -They were all... Just five or four. -Uh-huh. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] The men are getting anxious, Captain. Right. Now take your position over there. Yes, sir. -We only have a few minutes, Chief. -I know, I know. -What did the girl say? -Well, she seemed pretty confused. Near as I can figure out, we got at least two terrorists, half a dozen hostages, and one dead janitor. Time for the bus. I hope those kids come out of this alive. Chief, the bus is ready. -All right, bring... -GAMAL: Chief! You have one minute left! If I do not see a bus in exactly one minute, I will kill a hostage! Get a bus up here. All right, just hang on! The bus is coming. Don't hurt anybody! [BUS ENGINE STARTING] I hear the bus! The bus is coming. Gus? Gus? [SOBBING] Get up. On your feet. Come on, up! Get up! On your feet! Up! Now, listen to me. We're leaving now. Stay very close to us and make no sudden moves and no one will get hurt. -Is that understood? -Yeah. Come on, get up. Up! Fuck you, asshole! -Don't hurt her! -[SCREAMING] -Help! -Leave her alone! -Shut up! -Stay where you are! [SCREAMS] We're staying, we're staying. -[KICKING] -Come on, stop it! That's enough! My leg! GAMAL: Get up! I can't! Make him leave her alone, can't you see she's hurt? Ow! Gamal, that's all right, leave her behind! We've got to get out of here! Come on, move! Let's go! Wait, listen! You can leave her. -Take me, I'll go with you! -Shut up. You speak too much. You're coming with us anyway. You're an insufferable son of a bitch! -[GRUNTS] -[JENNIFER SCREAMS] Wait! Stop! [GROANING] Stop it! Damn it! They've got the bus, what are they waiting for? Maybe they're waiting for the FBI. -[SOBBING] -YASSIR: What are you doing? What did you want me to do, let them take my gun and kill us both? We need them as our hostage! See if he's all right. [JENNIFER EXCLAIMS] He's dead. That's all right. Let's go, hurry up! -No! -Shut up! I'm not going... Stay still! [YELLS] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GUNFIRE] Hold your fire! Hold your fire! They're killing those kids, let's move in now! Keep your shorts on, Captain! All right, you've got your bus. The game is over, come on out. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [CRIES OUT] RAWLINGS: Hey, talk to me or we're coming in! Don't you make a move. Let go of me! Shut up! Hey, Chief! We're coming out. You promised not to hurt anybody. We had an accident. One of the students tried to take our weapon. It is regrettable. I am sorry! Are you going to believe him? Do I have a choice? I want a hostage before you come out. We will take only one hostage with us. [GRUNTING] The others we will leave behind. -Let go! -Stop moving! I don't like it. Sounds fishy to me, Chief. Let's just see what comes out the door. Don't move! Stay exactly where you are. If anyone moves, I will kill the girl. Chief, I'm going to be getting something out of my car. So keep everyone back and away from it. Don't move! [GRUNTS] [YELLS] [GUNFIRE] [JENNIFER SCREAMS] Get up! Get up. Get up. No, I'm not... All right, move back. Move back, damn it! [DOOR CLOSES] Come on, now. You can make it! God! Hold still! Gamal.
