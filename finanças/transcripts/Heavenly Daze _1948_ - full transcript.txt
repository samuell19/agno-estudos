[♪] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes, yes. Shemp is not? Oh, Shemp is. Oh. Miss Jones, bring in the earthly report of my nephew, Mr. Shemp. Shemp, there seems to be some mix-up regarding your eligibility to enter these portals. But Uncle Mortimer, I... Is this what you want, sir? Thank you. [HICCUPS] Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep! Shemp! Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Mm-mm. Bad, Uncle Mortimer? I hope you brought your asbestos suit with you. Asbestos suit? Gosh, no. I wouldn't need it up here. I-- Oh, no. Look, what did I do that was wrong? I wouldn't know, having died before you were born, but your report shows that you and your cousins, Moe and Larry, have been pretty bad boys. Oh. Well, I'll be on my way. Get me a pitchfork and a red union suit and I'll go. Wait. I'll give you one chance. Go back to Earth and reform Moe and Larry and you can come back here for good. Gee, thanks. I'll reform that Moe and Larry if it kills me. Hey, that doesn't make sense. I'm already dead. [CHUCKLES] You realize that they will not be able to hear you or see you. They won't be able to hear me or see me? That's great. That's perfect. [HICCUPS] Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep! [CLEARS THROAT] File this report, Miss Jones, until Mr. Shemp returns from his earthly visit. Oh, by the way, my nephew, Mr. Shemp. My secretary, Miss Jones. How do you do? Charmed. [TRAIN BELL TOLLING DISTANTLY] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] MAN: All aboard the heavenly express, bound for the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper, Earth, Mars, Venus, Cucamonga, and high and low points south, leaving from Cloud 49. All aboard! You'd better hurry or you'll miss your train. Now, the depot is down this way one block and one block to your right. Gee, thanks. Well, goodbye. Goodbye, she says. If I leave now, that proves I'm dead. Well... [CHUCKLES] ...goodbye. Listen, you old rain cloud, why don't you look where you're going? I had the right of way. [THUNDER CRASHES] what's the idea? You think you're in California? Gee whiz. [WOLF WHISTLES] [WOLF WHISTLES] Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. [EXPLOSION] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [GRUNTS] Cut it out, Uncle Mortimer! MAN: All aboard! Wait for me! [TRAIN CHUGS] [MOE AND LARRY WEEPING] "...Et cetera, et cetera. "And furthermore, whereas I, Shemp the stooge, "being of unsound mind, do hereby prove it "by leaving all my worldly possessions "to my cousins, Moe and Larry. Share and share alike." [BOTH BLUBBERING] Poor Shemp. He was such a sweet stinker. FLEECEM: Boys. This is all of poor Shemp's worldly goods. A hundred and forty dollars. To be divided equally between you. Poor Shemp. He left us all his money. BOTH: Money? Let go of that. Oh! It's a good thing you hit me with money, or I'd resent that. Quiet. We gotta divide this dough up fair and square. Say, there seems to be some more in here. Wait a minute. [LOUD SNAP] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Oh! [LAUGHS] [SCREAMING] Oh! Laugh that off. [MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] A hundred and forty smackers. That makes 70 bucks for you, Larry. One, two, three, four... Say, at what age did you graduate from grammar school? Eighteen. Eighteen, 19, 20, 21, 22. Robber. Say, tell me, how old do you have to be to collect your old-age pension? Sixty-five. Sixty-five, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70. There we are. Hey! Your pile is bigger than mine. Here's where I start reforming you, mister. [BLOWS] Why don't you watch what you're doing? What are you talking about? You know what we're talking about. Yeah. You blew the money right off the desk. Ah--! Ah! I'll divide it this time. [MONEY RUSTLES] That's better. I think you gypped me. Oh! You been picking on that little guy long enough. It's about time you got a dose of your own medicine. Oh! Oh, a wise guy, huh? Go on... I didn't do nothing. Why, you. I'll.. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [LAUGHING] Now, wait. I'll mash you! Hey! That's enough of this nonsense. Pay me my fee. I've got a luncheon date. Oh, yes. Your fee. How much is it? A hundred and fifty dollars. Why, Shemp only left us 140. I'll take it. Are you sure this is all you've got? That's the last red cent, Mr. Fleecem. See? [CHORTLING] Any other lawyer would have taken the case for $20. Oh, is that so? [LAUGHING] That's what I call easy pickings, suckers. Are you telling me. [CHUCKLING] Well, be seeing you later, chump. Don't stay in the office too long. Dirty crook. You mind if we breathe? That dirty crook. Well, that did it. We're flat broke. Got a dime for carfare? Say, I had some airmail stamps. Well, what do you know? I know you're trying to gyp me again. [GROANING] Moe, I wasn't trying to gyp you. I thought I had a couple of-- Moe. Yeah? You took my money, didn't you? Yeah, sure. My pocket was empty, wasn't it? Sure. Well, what's this? Hey, there's something funny going on around here. I got it. You know, Shemp said he was coming back to Earth to haunt us. Ah, let him come. I ain't afraid of that fathead. Oh! Oh! Moe, what'd you hit me for? MOE: I didn't touch you. That's what I was afraid of. Shemp's here. It's him. His ghost just hit me. Oh, I ain't afraid of ghosts. Stand aside. I'll prove it. Keep your hands in your pocket. Shemp, if you're around here, give me a smash on the chin and convince me. Oh--! Ow! Ow! Oh. I'm convinced. And how I'm convinced. Well, I'm not. Shemp, if it's really you, do something else to prove it. See? He ain't here. Ah--! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! [CHUCKLING] Well, things are looking up. [LAUGHING] I say, Lord Larryington. Oh, there you are, Sir Moeington. Cheerio, pip-pip, and all that sort of rot, old thing, old stuff, old fishmonger, old skunk bait. You don't have to overdo it. Well, we're trying to be elegant, ain't we? Yeah. Say, where's that butler of ours? Oh, Spiffingham. BUTLER: Cheerio, sir. Yes, sir? Is everything in readiness? Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's enough. Hey, you know, I'm worried. I hope this little scheme of ours works out. It had better, after we spent all of Shemp's inheritance to rent this apartment, get these suits and hire that butler. Well, we had to do something to impress the Depeysters. After all, we're trying to sell them that phony fountain-pen invention of yours for 50 grand, ain't we? MOE: And how. Say, why would anybody want a fountain pen that writes under whipped cream? Well, uh, a fellow can be in the desert where there ain't any water to write under, can't he? Yeah. I never thought of that. I sure hope the Depeysters will be impressed with our butler. Mm-hm. If you have a butler after I get through giving him the business. [DOORBELL RINGS] That's funny. I'm sure I heard that doorbell ring. Uh-oh. If someone's in here, how come I can't see him? And if they ain't in here, then this hat and coat's out for a walk by itself. Uncle Mortimer, let him hear this. MORTIMER: Okay. [SNEEZES] Gesundheit. Who am I Gesundheiting? [WHIMPERS] [MOE AND LARRY LAUGHING] Oh, boy. I can hardly wait till we get our hands on that 50 grand. Here's to success with the Depeysters. [SPITS] What's the big idea? You did it and you're asking me? Quiet. I didn't do it. Moe, it must be Shemp. He came back to haunt us. Shemp, if you're in this room, give us a clue, will you? But no tricks! Oh, no? Ow! Ow! Ow! It's him. Shemp, where are you? Shemp! Gentlemen, does this hat and coat belong to either one of you? Oh, no. Those belong to our dear, dead cousin. Did you say "dead"? MOE: Yes. Then if he's dead, who gave me this hat and coat? His ghost. Says which? [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, uh, that must be the Depeysters. Spiffingham, answer the door. No, sir. That might be that ghost. It can't be the ghost. He's right here in this room, maybe alongside of you. Oh... [SNIFFLES] Feet, why don't you get going? [BODY CHATTERING] Yes, get going and answer the door. I'm going, but my heart ain't in it. [DOORBELL RINGING] Say, hurry up. We better clean up. Come in, folks. Why, you look as if you've seen a ghost. Mister, you don't know the half of it. DEPEYSTERS: Good evening. Seat? Plotz. We shall return momentarily, aye, wot? [SCREAMS] [GASPING] [SCREAMING] Guess I got rid of him. Now to see that the Depeysters don't get gypped. Here is our invention. Well, I'm dying to be the first one to see a fountain pen write under whipped cream. Indeed. So am I. [CLEARS THROAT] Now, you take the fountain pen and place it in here. And put the paper in thusly. And pour the cream over all. Now, turn the motor on to low. LARRY: Low. MOE: It must turn slowly. Otherwise, it would overflow. Now, would you care to make out your check for 50,000 now or later? Ah! [GASPS] [LAUGHING] This is preposterous. What next? A towel. I'd like to have a towel. Oh, my... [WHIMPERING] [SCREAMS] Idiot! Oh, thank you. You and your invention. Now, you look-- [ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Ow! Ah! Ah! Ow! Oh! Uncle Mortimer, it's working out. I think they'll turn honest. [EXPLOSION] Help! Help! Oh! Help. Help me. I'm burning. I'm-- No! Oh, Moe! Oh! Want a piece of pie? Moe! Larry! That guy's dreaming again. Why don't you--? Hey, Larry! He's been smoking in bed again! Get the water and the ax! Put me out! You nitwit, you! Oh! Oh! Oh! Why, you brainless idiot. Oh! Oh! Turn him around. Hurry up. MOE: That's it. Why, you nitwit. Get some more water. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay. Look out. I'll-- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [SIGHS] [EXPLOSION] [SIZZLING] Oh! Oh! Oh! [SIGHS] What a dream. You know, fellas, I just dreamt we invented a fountain pen that writes under whipped cream. [LAUGHS] Under whipped-- [SPUTTERS] There's your whipped cream. And there's your fountain pen. Write yourself a letter. Dear Ma... [♪]
