So your dues... 30 bucks due. Take just one. I promise I'll clear all dues by next week. God knows how your family tolerates you. Such a pervert. Shut up! You don't know how it helps. How? You won't understand. You're an idiot. Like a drug, it heals you from within. How? You won't get it. Why? You're dumb. By next week, all dues need to be settled! 30 per DVD! 90 for three. Okay, okay. It's a double-DVD pack. If all dues aren't cleared, no further "healing." Okay. Don't forget. Okay, fine. Jaga. Oh, Hari? Where to? Ananda's house with this. He brought two DVDs. American or Japanese? How would I know. I'll find out. I'll wrap up my work and head over. Don't start before I get there. Foreplay is the real fun. Run and come back fast. See, see... see more closely! Put your head inside. Just die, moron! Die! Is Dr. Tripathy home? No. Where is he? Not on my lap. My wife is sick. Every man says that. I am serious. When will the doctor return? I don't know. He's gone to the hospital. Okay, thank you. Hello, Doctor! Hello. -I was looking for you. -Why? My wife is very sick. What's wrong? I don't know, but she isn't well. -You've... at this age? -No, no. -No abortion. -Nothing like that. Look at my age. I've seen several old perverts. Your reputation isn't good either. Nothing like that. Then what? Not sure. -Food poisoning? -No. -Cold and cough? -No. Headache? Then what? I can't say, but she looks depressed. All wives are depressed. Just forget about it. But she isn't talking. There must be a problem. She needs medicine. Do one thing. In a cup of warm water, add six spoons of salt twice a day. Okay. I have 20... Leave it! May I drop you? No... I'll walk. You might be late. Don't worry. Mind your own business. But I don't have a business. Good, go home! Why not study, Joe? Straight-forward questions. I tried. Memorized it all. But... I couldn't recall much during exams. I told you, Joe memorizing and understanding are different. Understand, don't memorize. I'm not studying anymore, Shilpa. I've decided I don't need money or status. I'm good with what I have. My mother, my van, my village. That's all I need. Why learn the formula of Ethylene? I can carry cement on my van and I'm good at it. Do as you like. Stay a van driver or get educated, it's your choice. If I do well, I've got to go to a city for graduation. So? Who'll look after my mother? Auntie Rekha is there. And that's not an issue. If you don't want to, don't do higher studies. But why not study now? Whatever you're doing now, do it well. I try, Shilpa. I've noticed that you understand whatever is taught. But it doesn't go into my head. How do you know I understand? I can read it in your face. Instead of staring at my face, if you listen, you'll understand. If you fail, I won't talk to you. I'll try. I'm serious, Joe. If you even fail a single subject, I'll never talk to you again. You're putting pressure on me. Pass all subjects... Chemistry? Yes, Chemistry too. 36 in Chemistry? 36? Close enough to let it slide? Listen. Okay, I'll score 40. Promise. Listen, please. Potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, iro-- Did zinc disappear? Oh yes, zinc. Zinc, ir-- No, no, start again. Potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron... Mom, pass the lamp. Get it yourself. I'm studying. As if you're doing me a favor. A body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion until and unless an external force is applied on it. A body continues to be in its state of rest or... Take it. -What is it? -Medicine. What for? I know something's wrong. I went to Dr. Tripathy. -He suggested-- -I'm fine. But, you look depressed. Can medicine cure everything? It's a simple treatment. He's a good doctor. Take it. Are you crazy? Disgusting! Is this medicine? I can deal with depression, but not with your madness. Threw it away? What are you thinking? You should've thrown yourself away. If your wife is depressed, guess what she needs. But, Doctor, how can I guess if she doesn't say anything? Keep her happy. Now go. Okay. How much... It's okay. Shilpa will complete school this year. She's interested in higher learning. Competitive exams are coming up. The exam fees are very high. Can you send a little more this year? I've got some savings, but... Only if it's possible. Yes... what? Fine... that's good enough. That will be good. And... Last week you went somewhere? Your mother was saying. Okay, okay. Lost Vedas? Loss... Las Vegas. Okay, okay. Is it a beach or hill station? Okay... yes, going on. And... don't forget... Yes, okay. Bye. So all dues cleared. Yes, but it's the last DVD in stock. Why? Endless problems. I got away twice. Police? Give them a couple of free DVDs. Those days are gone. Their salaries have increased. They aren't taking bribes. Not taking bribes? No, they're very strict now. No illegal business, no pornography. Change yourself now, you old pervert. India is developing. Shut up. Why are you laughing? Your business will be screwed up too. No, I have back-up plans. Legal business starting next month. Legal business? Not a single DVD will sell. As long as Salman Khan is there, some will surely sell. One last copy. Go and enjoy. Okay listen. These 30 rupees are for next week. Just cleared the earlier dues. You're hopeless. Anyway I can't supply anymore. So... it's free... enjoy! Okay, thanks. Are you upset, Shilpa? What makes you think so? You aren't looking happy. Life has its share of happiness and sorrow. What's wrong? Tell me. I hate my father. Too long introduction. No action. Gives me headache. Start it, start it. What's going on? Why don't you follow it? Always impatient. What's there to follow? Boring things. Fast forward! Fast forward! Oh, be patient. 10 mins gone, all clothes on! Boring things. Ananda, move forward. It's not wise to wait any longer. Impatience is a disease. 25 mins gone, no sign of action. What nonsense. You should check before you buy. Seems a mistake. Spoiled my mood. What nonsense! What nonsense? The film looks interesting. Interesting? Film? Is it a film? No singing, no dancing, no fighting, no romance, and it's a film? That's why it's interesting. I think the filmmaker tried something new. Don't you think? Yes. Foreign films make no sense. It's madness. What the director has to say, why should we think? Just tell me, is there one good scene? Worthless director. My head is aching. Enough. More room for me. Hari, Jatin... want to join? Idiot, wait! You're intelligent, right? I find the film interesting. Isn't it interesting? Jatin, don't waste time on such nonsense. So that's how your father was introduced to the world of Godard? Yeah. But, how the hell did he understand? Godard is intellectually very heavy. Initially he didn't understand. He admired it without understanding? All that he understood was, there's something different happening. And that attracted him? It did. But... even our film-school students struggle to digest Godard. And your father? In a remote village, who doesn't even understand the subtitles. He started admiring Godard. It's harder to digest than Godard's films. Sometimes, rural people are more receptive. Absurd. Did your father watch all of Godard's films? Not all. But quite a few. Any that were available. He went on watching without understanding? No. One day he asked me. Shilpa. Yes. Do you have an English dictionary? Yes. English words to Odia? English to Odia? Yes. Can you give it to me? What will you do? I need to know the meanings of some words. English words? Yes. It's been ages since I studied English. Which words? Okay, so the word is "drawn." Again, that's... "Drawn." D-R-A-W-N. You started teaching him English? What's wrong in it? He patiently learned? He tried his best. All of a sudden, we built a new relationship. We were not daughter and father anymore. We became teacher and student. I saw the positive in him. Even at his age, he was a young and passionate learner eager to know more as if knowledge is the only mission in his life. You know, Pablo, one good thing is... You started loving him more? No, but I started hating him less. Sounds stranger than fiction. You can write it as a script for me. You better write it yourself. Pablo, if you make films, will you cast me? It depends. On what? On the film, on the characters. Joe. Joe. It's okay. Get up. Get up! Don't cry like a kid. I tried really hard. It's okay. I almost passed. There's no such thing as "almost passed." But it's fine. You tried and that's all anyone can do. You said you wouldn't talk to me if I failed. I wanted you to do well. That's why I said it. Forget it. Exams are over. Come on. Check out what I brought for you. Look. Hey, look! -What's that? -A globe. Geography again? No, Joe. The world isn't just geography. I always dream of exploring the world. Maybe the dream won't come true, but looking at the globe, I feel like I can see the world. And I want... I want to show you the world, Joe. This is our country, India. And somewhere here, not clearly visible, is our village. And we? We remain invisible forever. We're tiny creatures. Our lives are too insignificant. Our lives, wishes, dreams. Our feelings, emotions-- Are you all right? I'm fine, Joe. I don't understand such complex things. What's complex, Joe? Can't you keep things simple? Come on. Okay, come! Shilpa, can I ask you something? When you become a success, will you remember me? Don't ask stupid questions. I'll still be a poor van driver. You'll be a successful lady exploring the world. Rich and famous. I know you'll... What did you do? Nothing wrong. If you get pregnant? That's why I say, "study"! Do you know Ananda's daughter... Shame on you, Ananda. Is this why your daughter goes to school? And does she get good grades? Is this what she learned? Shame on you. What has she done? What happened? Has Shilpa done something wrong? She shamed us all. If you can't control her, keep her at home. Why let her out? What's wrong? You go inside. Explain to me. What has she done? You saw it? No no, I didn't see. But someone saw. Hari told me. Harideb, you saw her? No, I didn't see her, but I heard. Jatin also heard. Jatin... Jatin... what have you heard? Tell me! Ananda, stop it! Jatin is a simple man. Don't put him on the spot. Allegations don't just fall from the sky. There must be truth in it. Okay, let me talk to Shilpa. I promise, it won't happen again. It's not so simple. There must be punishment. Harideb, please... Ananda, our hands are tied. We're friends, so we'll try to minimize the punishment. Jaga, Harideb. Isn't she like your daughter? Yes, but... The problem is everyone knows it. It's a prestige issue. What can we do? Listen, Ananda. We'll meet and pass judgement tonight. We'll see what can be done. That guy has to also be punished. Why, why that guy? Your daughter is a whore. Shut up! Why shut up? If she offers her body, who is at fault? The guy has done nothing wrong. You snake, shut up! Ananda, calm down! Look how he's raising his voice. Father of a whore! He has no shame. Our village was always cultured. Harideb, ask him to mind his language. Otherwise I'll... Damn old motherfucker! Stop, stop! Leave it be. So, the allegation was that you had sex with Joe in a paddy field. Yeah. What are you thinking? You didn't tell me this earlier. We've only been friends for two months. You want to know everything so soon? Yeah but... a story as eventful as this... Eventful? There was no event, just an allegation. And then? There was punishment? Yes. What punishment? Listen, Ananda. Your daughter will be stripped and taken around the football grounds. Hari, I'll kill you! Otherwise she has to leave the village. When you decided to leave the village, why did you choose this place? You could've gone outside of the state. May be outside of India. There're scholarships. I thought I'll go to the U.S. for higher education. But my father wouldn't allow it. Why? No. You will not go America. He started speaking English? Yes. And he spoke rather well. I want to pursue higher education abroad. What's the problem? You will not go America. Why? Why not? Because... America... has become naughty. So you chose to come here? Yes, but not immediately. The villagers didn't object? No, rather they wanted me to stay. Maybe... later they realized it was a rumor. In fact, after that... Harideb, Jatin, and Uncle Jaga came to my father and apologized. Did they become friends again? -Yes, but-- -But? Film festival. You've gone crazy. What's the problem? Don't we have festivals? We do. But festivals are for entertainment, not for boring films. If we do a festival at all, let's show popular films. Understand the intent. We can change the culture of this village. If we do a festival on Godard... people will become thinkers. Thinkers? Yes, thinkers. Thinkers? What will thinkers do? They will think. Think? Yes, surely. What will they think? Anything... which they haven't thought of. But why? Because they'll feel the pleasure of thinking. Pleasure? Thinking is labor. I'm tired of thinking. -What were you thinking? -When? Then, when you were tired of thinking. I can't remember. What are you thinking now? Now I'm thinking what I was thinking then. I'm tired of thinking. Ananda, don't force me to think. We'll remain as we are. Tell me what's the need? People are happy. Why should they think? Thinking will enrich them. Jatin. Think... one day, our villagers will think. New ideas will bloom. Our village will change. It will be a special village. Won't it be great? Jatin, you big dummy! Don't fucking nod to his fancy. Don't you know he's mad? We live in a time when people have stopped using their brains. We need to shake them up. There was a time when our ancestors stopped using tails. So now we don't have tails. If we stop using our brains today, our future generations will be born without brains. But... There's no but. We'll do it. Godard's films will shake them up. I have five DVDs. We'll show them all. But... How do we organize it? Jaga... Are you crazy? Why even think of it? It's impossible! Harideb, if you want to not get involved, it's up to you. We're doing it. We? Who is "we"? Myself, Jaga, and Jatin. Jaga and Jatin are intelligent. They understand its value. We'll do it and in a grand way. Since Ananda is insisting, let's give it a try. Jaga, I'm warning you, if you show those senseless French films, people will beat you up. Listen, if you want to save your back you'd better ignore Ananda's whims. You've got a negative mind. You're good for nothing. Okay, I'll be off. You'll see where this goes. And Jatin... Jatin is a useless character. He was supposed to bring the projector. Why? People trust him. He's a simple guy. Jatin, don't go. Stop, Jatin, stop. It's a trap. Why fall into it? Jatin, don't go. Jatin, Jatin... Do your job. Bring it, Jatin. Bring the projector. Jatin, don't be a fool. They're using you. Go and return the projector. Big dummy, they're using you. Don't you understand? Jatin, it's a matter of trust. We trust you! Everything depends on the projector. Our plan will fail without it. Will you get us in trouble? What did he look like? Skinny? Skinny or fat? Short? Or tall? What nonsense! Same fucking nod. What's "Hmm-Hmm"? Fucking dummy! You ran pushing the bike? If you rode the bike, you could catch him. Idiot! He must have been puzzled so his brain didn't work. Donkey! Leave it be. -We need to find the projector. -Come on. Leave the bike here. Come on. Did a boy run this way? Haven't seen him? Hasn't seen him. Let's check. Not that way. Lots of people over there. This way. They must be hiding. Have you seen a guy with a box? This is the only way. Auntie... have you seen a boy carrying a box? I haven't seen anyone. Let's go! Quiet... shut up! You fucking dumbbell! Stop him! Stop him! Trying to escape? Sit down. I won't tell anyone. Don't act smart. So, let's hear your confession. Why did you steal that? I didn't want the festival to take place. But why? I love films. Then you should be happy. Why don't you make me a part of it? Oh, you want to be involved? Couldn't you come and tell us? Okay, okay, you can be a part of our team. People were informed? Yes. Really... strange. Listen up, listen up. Friends, listen up. Tomorrow we are organizing a film festival at the "Ground of 12 Ghosts" starting at 2:00 PM. Brothers and sisters, tomorrow we are showing you a foreign film. Yes, a foreign film. All heroes, heroines, villains, are foreigners. There are no heroes, heroines, or villains. All are characters. You have to communicate in language that people understand. Ananda, I'm a little scared. What if we get beaten up? You are inviting trouble. Why 2:00 PM? The Sun will be blazing. You'll see. If you say 2:00 PM, they'll come at 5:00 PM. We can't help if it's hot. Once they come, we'll start. What's the trouble? Go on. Listen up, listen up. Friends... listen up. Tomorrow we are organizing a film festival at the "Ground of 12 Ghosts" from 2:00 PM. Brothers and sisters, tomorrow we are showing you a foreign film. Yes, a foreign film. All heroes, heroines, and villains are foreigners. Revealing costumes and fair skin. Don't cross the line. Don't poke your nose. Listen up, listen up... Friends, listen up... Hari bhai, let's watch a foreign film tomorrow. Foreign film? "Let's watch a foreign film"? Get lost! It's a new scam. Foreign film screening... French films... Intellectual fuckers! Go... go... Get lost. Foreign film... At the "Ground of 12 Ghosts" from 2:00 PM. Tutu, all the festival-related work, Jatin will handle. He knows all the details. He's a one-man army. You just accompany him, okay? Jatin... so... You can pull it off, right? So it's done. Hold it. Hold it. Get the fuck off! I carry it, and he sits. Where should we point the projector? Point it in your ass. This way. Point it that way. Come on, don't pose. Dumb fuck! That's not the way. Sit and wipe. Clean that end, dumb fuck. Sit down! Sit and wipe. Properly. That corner. It's all on my shoulders. Footprints. What? Why ask him? Film? French cinema. -Come and see it. -Is it good? French cinema, man. Quality guaranteed. Don't miss it. What are you staring at? Get the bamboo. Keep holding it. Leave it. What's happening? We're screening films. French films. Listen, bro, any "good" scenes? Top class. Awesome! Should I call everyone? French cinema, man. You just call them all. I'll go and let them know. Come... come. Witness it... witness it in our village... in our village. Highlighting... highlighting... highlighting. Cinema... cinema... cinema... Cinema... cinema... Witness it... witness it... witness it. Witness it... witness it... witness it. So, this actually happened? It's hard to believe. Godard would have committed suicide had he seen it. He would have loved it. After all... it's all for the love of Godard. You sleeping, bro? Be patient, bro. A "good scene" will come. I gotta go. Why waste time on French films? Any "good" scenes? No. Any well-known hero? No. No, no... Not a minute of dance. No, no... It's giving me a headache. I need to go. Really... a fucking stupid film. I have to go. Are we all fucking stupid? Wasting time over bullshit films. No! I could've been sleeping... like a log. Fucking waste of time. No, enough is enough. I gotta go. Pain in the ass. Is it a romantic film? No. Action? Or a thriller? What the hell are you watching? Try to follow. I was peeling potatoes. Why did you rush me over here? What kind of nonsense is this? Just go home. I'll show you what film is. Watching films? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Enough of this nonsense! Hello? Gopal? No, I'm watching a motherfucking film. A fucking awful film. Some motherfuckers are showing French films. Oh French film... French, French... fucking French film. One person... Oh, I can't understand a damn thing. It's a mind fuck. A person moves from here to there, and there to here. Can't understand a thing. Here to there, and there to here. Just fucked up my mind. Hello? Can't you hear, motherfucker?! Hello? Can't you fucking hear me?! Jaga. Let's go there. Let's take a look. Yes, let's go. Wait... wait... wait. I was thinking, since Tutu is there he'll tell us everything. And Jatin is there too. Yes, true. Ananda... are we feeling... scared? Scared?! No. I'm not scared at all. That Harideb... He tried to scare us. But could he? No, no. But, Ananda, if we aren't scared, then what are we doing here? What do you mean? I told you, "Let's go, let's go." You said we shouldn't go. When did I say that? Then, let's go. Let's go. Hey... wait... wait... wait. Well, what you said... Tutu and Jatin are there. It makes sense. Why are you staring at me like that? Do you think I'm scared? -No, no, no. -No, no, no, no, no. I'm thinking, since they're there, do we really need to go? You have a point. But then again, we planned the festival. So I think we-- -Should go, right? -Yes, we should go. Yes, but, just think. If we go there, Tutu and Jatin will be completely dependent on us. They won't take responsibility. Young blood. If they don't take responsibility, how can we organize the festival every year? Right, absolutely right! They are the young ones. They need to take responsibility. Of course. Then I think... Let's not go there, Ananda. But I'm sure that people are having a blast. Their forefathers are blessed that they are watching Godard's films. They can't even pronounce the name of the films. Think how lucky they are. Truly, Ananda... You made it possible. No, no. Yes. -You made us proud. -Not just me. It's all teamwork. -Tutu. -Tutu. You're so restless. What's wrong? I came running. The projector worked? Yes, the projector worked. And sound? Sound is good too. How many people turned up? Almost the entire village. The entire village? I knew it. How is the response? They're cursing us like hell. What? That's why I fled the scene. And that dumb dumb? Jatin? Festival, isn't it? Foreign films?! French? Godra? You'll show us Godra? Kill this motherfucker! French film, bastard? Godard's films? You show us those fucking French films? Fucking festival! Don't dare do another festival. You'll show us Godra?! Intellectual fucker! Fuck you, French style! Son of a bitch! Jatin, you must be in a lot of pain. I feel sorry for you. I told Jaga we should have gone. What? It was me who... Quiet... quiet... If we were there, would they dare touch him? But we-- Quiet, I said. We were late. Accept it. They were brutal, weren't they? They used canes? So sad. You saved your ass. Poor Jatin got brutally beaten. Shameful. It's all because of Ananda. Hey, Harideb, stop poking your nose in an internal matter. We are one team. Team? Where was your team when they caned him and kicked him? And, Jatin, I warned you, don't trust Ananda and Jaga. Didn't I warn you? Just notice their silence. Had you taken my advice... Very painful, isn't it? Your father is quite spineless, I would say. No one is perfect. By the way, what happened to that doctor? -Dr. Tripathy? -Yeah. That's another story. Ananda, there's a big news. What? I don't believe it. Must be rumors. Jatin, you've seen it right? Tell me. You've seen it? So, who was that lady? No one knows. Some say she was a nurse at the hospital. But nobody's sure. Another new character. You can exclude her from your script. There's no significance. The story is interesting, but the character is confusing. I don't know how to establish her. I have an idea. What if the lady is... your mother? No. Pablo, there's a limit. She's my mother. Ah, calm down. In a film, she's just a character. You remember the earlier scenes where your father goes to Dr. Tripathy because your mother was sad. And what he indicates? I mean, look. Won't it add another dimension to the story and bind the narrative in a better way? I don't care about your script. You dare not do this. Okay fine. Erase it from your mind. I love the sea. Mountain is better. Why must you compare? Both are good. Shilpa... shall we? Okay, tell me... are you wondering whether I'm a virgin or not? -No! -No? No. No? No. No? A firm "No", then a weaker "No," then a feeble "No." And now an obvious silence. See... this is obvious because I don't know your past. But at least I have a decency not to talk about it. How would I know what you and your Joe-- What? Me and my Joe? What if we had sex in the paddy-field? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. Or in other words, what is the guarantee that the allegation wasn't true, isn't it? Shilpa, you're unnecessarily... Go get the condom. Shilpa listen, I didn't mean that. Go get it. Go... get it. Switch off the light. Okay, keep the night light on. Shilpa, I'm sorry. I don't know if unknowingly I've offended you. Why sorry? Your mission is accomplished. Cheers. You're completely misinterpreting me, Shilpa. I never intended to hurt you. I love you a lot. You love me a lot? Don't you know? Then... why did we... What's your problem? I lost my virginity. To men it doesn't matter. You enjoyed it. Finished. How does it matter if you love me or if you don't? But you insisted. I wanted to wipe off the suspicion from your mind. It doesn't matter to me if I'm a virgin or not, but it really matters when someone I'm with doesn't trust me. Just to wipe off any suspicion? There was no need to be so intimate. You're lying to yourself, Shilpa. We were intimate, yet not one. The thin sheet of rubber called the condom kept you away. How I love the condom. Don't do this, Shilpa. I had some clarity regarding our relationship and now you've thrown me into confusion. Then let me confuse a little further. The whole episode of Joe, "My Joe," and the accusation by the villagers was a story. It never happened. Then... why did you... The moment I introduced the character of Joe, I could sense an uneasiness in your eyes. I could understand that there was a seed of suspicion. So I just made up a story so that the seed blossoms. But... there was no need. How could I have exposed your nature otherwise? Look how fiction works. Then, it's all... a made up story? Confused? Shit. And I was already drafting the script. What's wrong with the script? But you said it's not true. So? Why does a film have to be true? Frankly, Pablo, you don't deserve to be a filmmaker. And our relationship? That's also not true? Certainly not. You played with my emotions? Why? Is it only a man's birthright to play with emotions? I don't know what kind of men you've interacted with. But I certainly value human emotions and feelings. Wow... great. Let's go. It'll take time to go to the station. So what's your decision? Regarding? Us. You and me were never "us." You might have imagined it so. That's your mistake. I'll never like to stay with an arrogant, egoistic, suspicious guy like you. You'll never understand me. You'll never value me. But I know there's someone, a simple guy that he is. You said Joe's story is fiction. The story may be fictional, but not the character. I know he'll wait in his van hoping that I'll return and he'll take me home. He has no expectations. He only has a dream. It's tough to be a lover in reality. I'd rather be his dream. Shilpa... I knew you would come. Did I keep you waiting? I would wait an entire lifetime for you. Come, we must find our way I'm ready to drown in your tears Unparted memories are buried deep in our eyes O, our lonely lives, alas You're near, O, dear, but love is yet to fill the air. Dear heart, it's a habit of staying alert... Hey, Ananda... Your luck is good today. Why? Any new Godard films? Stop the Godard obsession. Neither American, nor Korean. Made in India. Indian too? Yes, Indian too. Made in India. Need a scene that's made in India. A scene made in India. India! A scene made in India! ...because I don't know your past. But at least I have the decency not to talk about it. How would I know what you and your Joe-- What? Me and my Joe? What if we had sex in the paddy-field? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. Or in other words... what is the guarantee that the allegation wasn't true, isn't it? Shilpa, you're unnecessarily... Go get the condom. Shilpa, listen, I didn't mean that. Go get it. Go... get it. Switch off the light. Okay, keep the night light on. Listen, friends, you all know that old man, Ananda. He died. Why did he die? Because he was a sinner. What was his sin? He showed us French films. God... God... Godard. God... Godard. He showed us Godard films. Don't you remember? You do, right? That's why we've decided that in our village, be it a French film or that damn Godard, it's strictly banned! Understood? It's for your wellbeing. Because God... Godard... Godard is hazardous to your health. That's why... from now on, even taking the name of Godard will be considered a crime and call for serious punishments! Hey, Ananda, where are you going? To meet Mr. Godard. What madness! He's a French guy. How can you meet? He has come to meet me. Oh, Ananda! Even death couldn't teach you a lesson. Stop! Hello, Mr. Godard! How do you do? Hello. How are you? GODARD IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH GODARD IS BANNED IN THIS VILLAGE Deep in my heart, you're there forever Wounded mirrors often show unknown faces I'm safely home in my skeptic reality. "To be, or not to be," it's just an illusion I was... and I am truly yours Though not real You... or rather, we... shall remain... a memorable dream... We will keep flowing in our dreams I don't mind drowning in your tears Come, we must find our way I'm ready to drown in your tears To drown in your tears Be drowned in your tears. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
