The Collector of Brains based on "Thinking Robots" by George Langelaan a film by Michel Subiela I knew you wouldn't hold it against a loyal admirer. I just had to seize the opportunity to finally be able to tell you in person how much I respect you, even admire you. When did you hear me play, sir? This summer I attended every concert you gave on the French Riviera. Oh, really? Luck and coincidence have made it possible for me to always be in the same place at the same time as you. Your piano playing enchanted me from the beginning. It's so light, so delicate, so weightless. I'd almost say it's not of this world. I wonder if that's actually a compliment. There is no greater compliment, my lady. One can forget everything, throw off the ballast of emotions and weaknesses, to be only completely music. Would you mind telling me why you only paid me this compliment today, sir? When I arrived here in the city this morning, the first thing I saw was a poster announcing your concert. I believe in signs, after all. But I would never have dared to approach you unless there was a deeper reason. Yes, there is a reason. I have a passion, my lady. I create automatons. They are instruments with which I express myself and communicate. Just as you do with your music. And I've always had one thing in mind: the creation of an automatic pianist. And when I first heard you play, I knew immediately: This is it. He should be like you. I mean, he should play like you. - You embarrass me. It's too much. - Oh, no. You can't say that. If you helped me, it would give me great pleasure. Your proposal seems a little odd to me. No, that's not the right expression. I mean... Surprising. - Yes, you know. - You're absolutely right. Take your time. Think it over. Here you go. My card. May I hope, my lady? Thank you. COUNT OF SAINT GERMAIN Creator of automatons Last night at the municipal theatre: Piano Recital by Penny Vanderwood At the "Concorde" Circle: 2001, or The Chess Odyssey Yesterday, in front of a large and attentive audience, the chess championship started at the circle of the brewery "Concorde". During the whole week, the best specialists of our city will oppose the infallible and mysterious automaton, presented by the Count of Saint Germain. - Yes, lady? - I read that you host the chess championship. Yes, right. In the clubhouse. Wait, I'll take you there. Thank you. Hello, is this the British Embassy? May I speak to Mr. Lewis Armeight, please? I was glad to hear from you. I was really glad, even if I was startled at first. I know what you mean. I would never have made the first move and called you. I didn't want to talk about it, and yet... It was better that way. Or completely wrong. I always had Robert in mind. Something like guilt, you know? I didn't want to meet you until his image... How can I put it? Until it was erased from my heart. What nonsense. He will always be with us. Each of us by ourselves might stop thinking about him, but when we're together... Lewis, when the three of us wanted to go on holiday to Italy, you didn't come along because of a supposedly urgent job. Did you know at the time that he was going to ask me to marry him? He told me about it. One night, in a taxi, after we took you home. That was the week we decided not to go to Paris in our own car. We talked about the chess championship in Buenos Aires. I told him he was excellently prepared. He laughed. And then, suddenly, while he was still laughing, he confessed to me, "Lewis, I still have something to do before I leave Paris." "I have to tell Penny I love her." "I'll tell her once we get to Sorrento." "I think it's a nice idea." He told me. But you couldn't possibly know what my answer would be, Lewis. I've been waiting for it every day for a month. Every day I asked myself: "How did she answer him? Are the stars in his favor?" He was more than just a friend. I was very fond of Robert. And yet, during the month you were in Sorrento, I hoped each day you wouldn't return his love. But, Lewis, I found myself in an impossible situation. My only possible salvation was to say yes to Robert. I understand you. Robert gave you fun and joy. You laughed together. You liked that he was completely crazy. That's why you chose him over me. Robert's death was the worst thing that could have happened to both of us. It's absurd, but we avoided each other afterwards. But Robert is not dead, Lewis. He isn't dead? Excuse me. - I'd like a tea with lemon. - Yes, the same for me, please. - What are you trying to say? - I know that Robert is alive. Where did you come up with that, Penny? Does that mean you have proof? We both saw the coffin being carried from the plane. We were both at the Avrainville cemetery when he was buried in the family crypt. Yes, we were there. I haven't forgotten that, Lewis. No, I have no proof. But we could get some. That's why I asked you to come here. Hello, Penny. It's Lewis. Well, I've been there. I've opened the coffin. And what? Was he in the coffin? No, he wasn't in there. Now, pay close attention, please. I take the knight with the white bishop. Since the pawn is on the king's line, I move the rook from f8 to c8. This is an exact reconstruction of a positional game that we know from the Russian grandmaster Petrosian. Excuse me. - Do you have a moment, Vladieu? - Yes, president. Mr. Lewis Armeight. He is a school friend of our late Robert Tournon. I've seen you two together a few times. Tournon and Vladieu were our two best chess players. But I must say that both had a different style. Mr. Armeight wants to write an article about our late friend. It's for the Cambridge College newspaper. That's where we first met. Please come with me, sir. Robert was there to improve his English before he began to study political science. - Please sit down. - Thank you. But he has spent most of his time tarnishing the self-confidence of other chess players. Because some of our fellow students believed that they could not be beaten. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I'm not a good player myself. I'd be very grateful if you could tell me something about his style. - His speciality. - I'd love to. But it's not so easy. Perhaps it would be best if we showed Mr. Armeight the film. Which film? The film that was shot three years ago at the chess championship in Biarritz. Of course. An excellent idea. Come with me. This is typical of Robert. That was his strength and his weakness. Well, he never declined a King's Gambit, which of course is very dangerous. That's why he lost more games than he should have. But he needed the thrill. He practically played without a safety net. First he sacrificed a pawn in order to be able to attack faster. The resulting variations lead to a dynamic game. To win such a game, you need nerves of steel. Tell me, does every player have such characteristic features, such a personal style, that you could, for example, blindly say which opponent you're dealing with, even without seeing him? - This is probably an absurd hypothesis. - No, not at all. But it wouldn't be too easy. Of course, you can say of a particular move that it could be from Alekhine, for example. But that's not the entire game, Mr. Armeight. A player may have copied a few moves from another player. And yet someone like Tal has a personal style. And sooner or later you would certainly recognize him by that. Let's put it this way: everyone has their preferences. One player prefers open games, another defensive games. Tournon was one of the last great players who didn't mind if the queen was taken away from him. He was terribly tempted to play with that risk. This is all really very interesting. I thank you, and I apologize for the trouble I've caused you. It is something of a consolation to be able to speak of Robert Tournon. For us it is even a duty. I wanted to ask you about something else that has to do with the same topic. Robert often talked about how fascinating he found the idea of constructing chess playing robots. It certainly is a fascinating topic, although it's quite controversial. Not anymore, right? Much progress has been made in this area. If this continues, the robots will soon beat the chess masters. - It's not quite like that yet, is it? - Not yet. But there's already a computer world champion, that means a programmed world champion. It already plays about as well as a fourth-grade player, which is remarkable. Have you heard of that Count of Saint Germain? He claims to have constructed a robot that could take on any champion. The Count of Saint Germain? Oh, dear. One thing you have to give all these charlatans: they have a lot of courage. Do you think it is completely impossible for him to construct a robot with such capabilities? Think about it pragmatically. It would require enormous technical and financial resources. And even if that man had all these means at his disposal, he would rather build real computers instead of toys. Chess tournament Fine. I think it would be better if you wait here. You might be recognized. Penny? Tell me what you think. I think Robert is an automaton. Do you seriously believe that Robert gave himself up for the morbid masquerade of this charlatan? Why a charlatan? Do you know who the Count of Saint Germain was? A swindler who lived in the 18th century. He claimed that he had found the philosopher's stone. He claimed that he had discovered the elixir of life and had known Jesus Christ personally. Okay, Penny. I'll try to find out the truth. Cheating with mechanical chess players has a long tradition, and has of course discredited them. But the genius of human invention and the power of the mind have grown over time. What seemed impossible for us yesterday is suddenly possible today. Yes. It's true. In earlier days they used to hide people inside the bodies of robots. That's what the great writer Edgar Allan Poe found out about Kempelen's automatic chess player. No. No. There is no human being hidden inside my robot. I'm going to ask two volunteers from the audience to come down here and see the truth for themselves. You will see it with your own eyes, ladies and gentlemen. I'll allow you to look inside the robot's body for the entire time. It would be impossible, ladies and gentlemen, to hide a gymnastic man inside, no matter how small he may be. Not even a midget. The inside of the body doesn't allow it. It's impossible to get in there. There's not a corner in it one can hide in. If you please, sir? Come closer and look inside. The mechanism is of course highly delicate. To prove to you that you're not victims of an optical illusion, I would now like to ask one of the gentlemen to take this stick, and to poke it very carefully wherever it is necessary. Your conclusion, sir? I think it's actually a machine. But what a machine! Sir... Remember that you must strictly follow the rules of the game. When you touch a chess piece, you must move it. Any piece that has been placed is considered played. Gentlemen, go ahead. That was a mistake. That something like this would happen to him. He said it made him extremely nervous to play against a robot. There's nobody in the offices, sir. They've all gone home. - Are you sure nobody is here? - No, nobody. Thanks, madam. Sorry to disturb you. You're welcome. Good evening. Thanks. Here, keep the change. I want to ask you about the chess-playing robot. - I don't know more than you do. - Maybe you do. Does the Count of Saint Germain have anyone with him when he comes here? No, he always comes alone in his car. We get his robot out, and when he wants to leave, we put it back inside. So nobody in particular arrives before him and leaves after him? No, and trust me, I always keep my eyes open. - Are you having the same thought as me? - Which one is that? A transmitter. Someone could control the robot from backstage. With a transmitter like for model planes. Only more perfect. That's right. I was thinking something like that. You know what the boss said about it? You don't need a transmitter for that, you need long distance waves. - He's got a point there. - Thank you. And? It's confusing. I have the same strange feeling as you, Penny. But there's nobody in that robot, believe me. Then I thought maybe a player was hiding somewhere. He could observe the game and control the robot with a transmitter like a model plane. I checked every floor of the building. Nothing. Nothing. But maybe Robert or his accomplice were not even in the building. Maybe he was far away. But how could he have followed the course of the game? I think it's not just a little strange that a robot plays like a human. I agree. When Saint Germain leaves, we'll follow him. If he picks up an accomplice, we'll know more. But we still won't have an explanation. - Good night, Pierre. - Bye! See you tomorrow. See you. Bye! Robert! Go after him alone. It's not mine. It's not mine. It's not mine. It's not mine. Calm down. This is none of my business. No, I need it urgently. I need it. What you need is rehab. You aren't with the police? No, I'm not a policeman. But then, who was the woman who recognized me? She mistook you for someone else. She didn't recognize you. You mean she mistook me for another Robert? Yes, for someone else named Robert. Stand up! Come on! I talked to him all night. I've been trying to understand why he wrecks himself. And I wanted to convince him that it wasn't too late. - And did you accomplish it? - I think he rather helped me, Penny. Our detective game suddenly seemed ridiculous and silly. There are more important things than chasing ghosts. Are you giving up, Lewis? Have you found out anything new? No. I followed the car to the edge of town. On the main road I overtook him, I waited at the gas station and then followed him again. Great, Penny. It's like you've done nothing else your whole life. And then suddenly he made a turn. He must have noticed someone following him. I stayed behind him, but with a distance so that he could not recognize me. We drove about 100 kilometres like that. Then he suddenly turned left and disappeared in a driveway. I drove on and turned around after 100 meters. When I drove past the driveway again, the gate was closed. I didn't see anybody. Only through the branches of the trees in the park did I see lights that were switched on and off. - Was it a castle? - Not really. It looked more like one of those upper middle-class residential palaces built in the past century. A bit dilapidated. But 100 kilometres is much too far. No one can control a robot over such a distance. I just can't imagine it. Let's not worry about it anymore, Penny. The Count of Saint Germain is apparently a great magician. I don't understand any of it. Probably I will also never understand how one can conjure half a dozen doves from a silk scarf. And is it also just a trick that Robert's corpse disappeared? Yes. It's also a trick. But of a different kind. There's not the slightest connection. In that case we'll have to contact the police. Are you asking me to inform the police that I, Lewis Armeight, promising member of Her Majesty's Diplomatic Corps, desecrated a grave in a small French village at night? Just because the talented pianist Penny Vanderwood has beautiful eyes and a little too much imagination. No, you're right. We're not going to the police. We would create a tremendous scandal, which would not help us at all. No one would take us seriously, especially not the police. So what do you think? I probably shouldn't tell you about this, Penny. But I'm going to do it anyway. If only to give you some peace of mind. As far as that's even possible, Penny. Robert's disappearance didn't surprise me as much as you might have thought. A talented chess player like him naturally travels a lot. But, and I have known this for some years, he has not only been on the road so much because of the championships. There were other, secret missions, more or less official assignments. You get what I mean? Yes, I think so. These are assignments where one can die under certain circumstances. Yes, or one wants to be presumed dead so one can continue under a different name. Robert had so much trust in me that he would surely have given me a sign if he were still alive. Thanks for the breakfast. Thank you for being so patient with me and for taking so many risks. Goodbye, Penny. When will we meet again? When you feel it's right. When you really want it, call me. Bye. Lewis! And you no longer suspect anything? No, nothing. COUNT OF SAINT GERMAIN Creator of automatons Oh, I kept you waiting. I apologize a thousand times. But I wanted to get a special bottle from the cellar. Pardon me, my lady. You do me such a great honor. Actually, I expected a robot to follow you as a servant. Oh, no, no. Oh, my lady. I'm your loyal servant. I've longed for this day. I knew you'd come here. Really? I knew it. I was sure of it. This has nothing to do with vanity. You can't imagine how moved I was when you walked through the door a few days ago, into that hideous back room of the brewery. It was the day of your concert. You saw me? Even if I hadn't seen you, I would have known you were there. Please take a seat. I suddenly got what you would call stage fright. And then I heard your scream. - I was terribly uncomfortable. - Oh, no. No, no. I want to thank you for that scream. It finally gave me hope again. I said to myself: Here is the proof. I'm also capable of arousing feelings. I must confess that I was disturbed by the robot's human resemblance. Miss Vanderwood, I'm overjoyed at what you're saying. That is the greatest compliment an artist can receive. And now you've come here to help me create something even better. How can I ever thank you enough for that? Tell me exactly what you expect me to do. Nothing. Or rather, almost nothing. First I would like to ask you, but only if you want to, to take a seat at this grand piano. And tell me if you like it. If not, we'll have another one brought in. Oh, no. It's wonderful. Well then, if it's all right with you, we can start right now. - Should I play anything in particular? - Oh, no. Play whatever you want. Whatever you like best. Whatever comes into your head. As if you were alone. You see, I'm not interested in recording you on tape, at least not yet. I will explain it to you. What I want is for you to sit here and play whatever you like. I'll be watching you. And I'll listen to you. I'll walk around you like a painter or sculptor walks around his model. Wonderful. You'll inspire me. You'll be my muse. Now begin! Play! I think I need to spar with you again, Diego. You're finally showing your face again. Looks like you've been straying, flyweight. On behalf of the Queen. And how about Argentina? - And how about the British Pound? - Miserable. But my Queen is well. - Mine too. Are you going to change? - No, you change. I have a favor to ask of you. Do you remember Robert Tournon? Of course. I saw to it personally that his body was shipped to France. I had made arrangements with the French Embassy in Buenos Aires. Have you heard any news about how he died? No. I certainly don't know any more than you do. Say, he won a prize at the chess championship, didn't he? He then rented a car to drive around the country. It happened on the way back to Buenos Aires. His car skidded and caught fire. He burned to death in the car. And who actually identified his body? Someone from the French embassy. I don't know if, given the state he was in, you could even speak of identification. However, there was apparently enough evidence to conclude that it was him. Are you doubting it? No, his fiancée thinks he's still alive. Since this obsession is poisoning her life, I've been trying to convince her that it's utter nonsense. I'm not quite sure I accomplished it. You would only have to mess up five or six ministries and the entire diplomatic corps, to help you convince her. I just need one precise information. Was a certain Count of Saint Germain in Buenos Aires at the same time as Robert? If so, did he fly back to France soon after? I can easily find out, as long as he didn't fly under a false name. I'll give you a detailed description of him. Okay. But what is the connection between the two men? If you have dinner with me this evening, I can explain it all to you. I'm ready, sir. Oh, Miss Vanderwood. Imagine all the great people of the world being freed overnight from their fears, anxiety and misery to be able to create in peace. To create. To create. That's what I want to do. You mean like the gods do? Oh, no No, that would be blasphemy. But like demigods. The spirit is filled with knowledge of the misery of man about which we we cry. But the body is free. It's free. Is it this dream that drives you to perfect your robots more and more? What? What did you just say? Oh, yes, Penny. Oh, yes, Penny. That's how it is. Penny. Penny. You're just wonderful. Why didn't I think of that? Now I'm a little cold. It's pretty chilly. Oh, I'm sorry. Come with me. Let's go back inside. Yes, see you soon. I didn't expect you this soon. - But you've always been efficient. - Good morning, Lewis. Good morning. Take a seat. I found it out. Frédéric Count of Saint Germain flew from New York to Buenos Aires on 2 July and returned to Paris on 27 July. He was staying at the Hilton. So was Robert Tournon, in case you didn't know. Yes, I knew that. A little too many coincidences at once, don't you think? I agree. Now you need to execute your plan as quickly as possible, Lewis. - I hope it works. - Hopefully. - Clémentine. Clémentine. Hello, sir. Please come in. I apologize for showing up unannounced like this. Not at all. I was expecting you. Mr. Armeight? Lewis Armeight, First Secretary of the British Embassy in Paris. How do you do, Mr. Armeight? - Was it a joke that you were expecting me? - Oh, no. You were following me the other day. Don't deny it. I recognized your car. You wanted to find out where I live. And this, of course, because you wanted to come and visit me here one day. We'll now ask the young lady to interrupt her exercises for a moment. But if she has to practice, I don't want her to stop because of me. The only thing she needs to practice is becoming a robot, dear Mr. Armeight. Well then, Mr. Armeight. Since you introduced yourself as embassy secretary, I can assume that you did not come here to purchase one of my robots. Or to suggest that I should use them commercially and mass produce them. You're right. But let me ask you something. That's what I thought. Don't worry, even as a child I never felt the need to take my toys apart to find out how they work. I like to keep my illusions. So I'm not going to ask you about your secret. Rest assured, I wouldn't have told you either. I just want to know from you whether your chess playing robot, which I am interested in, is able to play a game when you're not present. Theoretically, yes. Like all my robots in this house, it does exactly what it was designed and programmed to do. You mean even if you were in Paris at this very moment, for example. Now, if I were to turn on your robot and play a game against it. Then he would defeat you for sure, no doubt. Because as far as I know you are not one of the three or four best players in the world. No, unfortunately, I am not. You have nothing to be ashamed of in front of me. I'm certainly no chess genius. Is that true, sir? Yes, it's true. But let's cut to the chase, Mr. Armeight. We're celebrating the Ambassador's birthday next Saturday. Every year we try to offer something special. - An attraction. - You couldn't have made a better choice. But there's a bet involved. Hence my question earlier. His Excellency is convinced that, however you do it, you're the one who plays the game yourself, not the robot. I don't share this opinion. So if I've understood you correctly, you are acting as the devil's advocate with your questions. Wonderful. But as I said before, it's theoretically possible. Theoretically. Surely you can understand that under no circumstances am I willing to subject my robot to dangerous manipulation. To clumsy curiosity, which could damage my work. Listen, Mr Count, I'll offer you £1,000 if you let the robot play against His Excellency and stay in an adjoining room meanwhile. The few people present will be known to you by name. You have the ambassador's word on it, as well as mine. No one will touch your creation, not even approach it. It would be wrong of me to refuse your gracious invitation. Besides, you must know, Mr. Armeight: I live only for my automatons, my robots, my creations. And this passion is certainly not cheap. I can imagine. - May I ask you something else? - Go ahead. Why do you call yourself the Count of Saint Germain? And not Von Kempelen, for example? Come on, Mr. Armeight. I'm not just calling myself that. I'm the Count of Saint Germain. I did it just like you suggested. I studied again very carefully all the important games I played against Robert Tournon. I don't know how to thank you for agreeing to participate in this little experiment. It's fun for me, Mr. Armeight. Just one more thing, between you and me. If I lose this game, please don't tell anyone. I'm putting the piece in place. Now things are getting dicey for him. I'm totally confused. It's like a hallucination. This robot behaves exactly like Robert. He plays exactly like Robert. I made the same moves as in the game against Robert two years ago. And he made exactly the same counter moves. It's eerie. He suddenly revived an old variation of mine from two years ago. On the same move. He defended himself with one of my tricks. I'm totally confused. I feel as if Robert has beaten me a second time in the same way. How does he know? He won't play us for fools any longer. Bring him to the office. Let's go. Maybe we can figure it out together. Gentlemen. What are you up to? What does this mean? Why have you brought me here? To ask you a question. Just one. And you will not leave this room until you have answered the question. - Your behaviour is as impossible as it is grotesque. - Be quiet. You speak to me in a tone that I absolutely can not approve of, sir. And I have no intention of submitting myself to such an interrogation. Oh, yes. You will answer. We three have a friend who, like all great chess players, has his own style, his own strategies and tricks. Your robot has the same style, strategies and tricks. Why is that? Ah, I see. So that's what all this farce is about. So you're all friends of Robert Tournon. Why didn't you tell me this before? You knew him? How else could he have inspired me? Every artist needs a model. I first met Robert Tournon last year. In Buenos Aires. He was very interested in the robots I demonstrated last summer. A juggler and an acrobat. He made a bet with me that I would not be able to construct an equally perfect chess playing robot. The bet was on. Once we got to know each other better, he told me a lot about the art of chess. And about his love for chess. I really liked him very much. My affection was deep and sincere. I saw how he played and how he lived, gentlemen. I heard about his death on the flight back to Paris. And in that moment, I knew I owed him something. I had to create this work as his legacy. I never intended to create a chess playing robot. But now I set out to create one. It didn't take me that long. - And I think I succeeded. - But how? But what a question, sir. To ask how. Ask any musician how a symphony is born. Or how a poet writes an elegy. Genius exists, sir. It is nothing but the perfection of illusion. But let's be honest, Mr. Armeight. What kind of ridiculous idea is floating around in your head? What kind of foolishness? You're not a child anymore. But perhaps you've been living in France too long. You're already poisoned by the myth of the rational. An explanation must be found at all costs. The impossible or improbable must not exist. Mr. Count, I think I owe you an apology. No, sir. Please. Your excitement and confusion show me that I've come very close to perfection. I forgive your behavior, sir. And I consider it a compliment. Would you be so kind, please? I'd be extremely embarrassed if I didn't at least greet His Excellency, gentlemen. He lost his bet. And you won your bet through me. Mr. Armeight. It's really wonderful what you've created. You must present it to our circle. We look pretty silly now, don't we? A scotch? Well, I guess that takes care of any doubts. Completely. That was the most important thing. Now I can call Penny and tell her the truth. She's free, you see? You know what that means? She's free. A scotch without water. This is Penny Vanderwood. I'm spending the weekend in the country with my parents. I ask that you call me there only in urgent cases. I have important work to do. If you wish to leave me a message, please speak after the beep. I can't stand these answering machines. She went to her parents in the country for the weekend. - Don't they have a phone? - They do. - So call them. - At this hour? I have a feeling I'll be drinking my coffee in the country tomorrow. Penny. My dear child. Do you like this journey to the land of wonders? Your happiness is payment enough for me. It gives men gratitude. They thought they were so smart. They followed the first best guess. And they were so proud. To have found out that an automaton played just like a man they once knew. But no-one noted the difference. The truth. That Robert Tournon himself will never play again. Penny. And the journey continues. From the beautiful to the ugly. From good to evil. From delight to horror. You wander around like a poet. From paradise to hellfire. Then your mind breaks free and reaches the genius. And nothing in this world will ever again be able to stop the power of your talent. Oh, Lewis. That's quite a surprise. - Hello. - It's been a while since you've been here. Is Penny coming with her father? I don't know, Mrs. Vanderwood. Oh, I thought you met my husband on the way and were coming back with him. Wait, didn't Penny come here for the weekend? No. I thought she was spending the weekend with you in Honfleur. No. I was hoping she'd be here. But Penny told me you two were going to visit mutual friends, just like last weekend. I mean, you were in Honfleur with Penny last weekend, weren't you? Yes, we went there. It was probably my fault. I must have been unclear. I had nothing special planned for the weekend, so I thought we would go together to meet our friends. How silly of me. Now she's waiting for me in Paris. You came all this way for nothing. You young people don't talk properly anymore, that's the problem. You're right, Mrs. Vanderwood. The best thing would be for you to call Penny. You're right. May I use your phone? - Of course. You know where to find it. - Yes, thank you. This is Penny Vanderwood. I'm spending the weekend in the country with my parents. I ask that you call me there only in urgent cases. I have important work to do. If you wish to leave me a message, please... Did you reach her? No, Penny is not at home. I don't blame her. I'm sure she got tired of waiting. What one has found again, one should not lose again. This is Penny's latest record. Do you like it? The music is by a young and promising composer. Yes, it's really beautiful. If you'll excuse me, I must be going. Stay a few minutes. My husband will be back soon. He'd be so happy to see you. Excuse me, but I have to go to Honfleur. Perhaps Penny has already arrived there. Goodbye. Please tell Penny to call me, so I can be calmer. Yes, that's right. So put on your quiet shoes. And bring a revolver. No, I don't have one on me. Okay, I want you to wait for me at the intersection. Okay, I'll drive as fast as I can. Yes, hopefully we'll make it before dark. Okay. Bye. The wall's a little high here, but over there's his dog. Dogs don't like me. It moves like a robot, like it has a built-in radar. - What now? - I'll try to take it out. Even if it doesn't work, we have to get inside the house. Okay? Okay. What do you mean? Does he have an alarm system? Hopefully not on the first floor. My name is Lewis Armeight. Is there any connection between you and Robert Tournon? You're crazy, Lewis. You want to write something? Can you even do that? Diego, give me a piece of paper quickly. He wrote one or two letters before he reached the paper. But which letters? Maybe it means, "Check the basement." What do you say? Where's the basement? Let's go. - It's an armored door. - What should we do now? Give me your revolver. You open any window up on the ground floor, okay? Okay. Lewis! Lewis! Help me! Lewis! Lewis! Do something! Shoot! Penny! Penny! Penny... Go first! I can't get it open, damn it. You can rest assured, sir. She hasn't been harmed. At least I suppose not. - She does seem to be in pain. - No, she's waking up from some frenzy. - I'll take her to my infirmary. - So it's serious after all. No, I'll explain it to you. She's been given drugs. Hallucinogens. I don't know what she was given or what the dose was, but there is no reason to be alarmed. Believe me. I just want to observe her for a few days. Go no further, sir. It's forbidden to trespass. I am Professor Molière of the Salpêtrière Hospital. - Is anybody hurt? - No, nobody. There was no one in the house. The owner is a strange fellow. He travels around the world and demonstrates his robots. He just took another trip yesterday. - Tell me, was there a fire? - No, luckily there wasn't. There must have been a short circuit at some point. Anyway, all his automatons burned and melted. If the alarm siren hadn't gone off, we wouldn't have noticed anything. Yes, in that case it's nothing serious. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Goodbye What's that about? What do you want with that stuffed dog? Take a look what's inside its head. - Inside its head? - Yes. Try to open the flap at the back of the head. It can actually be opened. Tell me what's inside. Tell me, please. Well, a plastic casing with a weird liquid in which a dog's brain floats. It's probably a dog's brain, but it might as well be a sheep's brain. I'm not a veterinarian. And what else? Nothing else. Just a bunch of wires. If it were a child that was engaging in such stupidities, one should let a good psychiatrist examine him as soon as possible. I agree. You think we can find a good place to get a drink around here? That's a good idea. I think we need it as much as you do.
