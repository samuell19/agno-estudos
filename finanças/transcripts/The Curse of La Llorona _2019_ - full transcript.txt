The bus is right here. - Chris, if I don't get home in time, dinner in the fridge. - All right, let's fix it. Mici! Sorry, honey. Mom, where's my jacket? In the closet above. Run, Run, Run! Snacks.

Fast, fast, fast, running! Bass! Do not talk dirty! Los Angeles City, Child Protection Department Case Type: Trap child Abuse - Yeah, Donna. How do we deal with Alvarez? - I called the mother several times, but she doesn't pick up. - I'll go with a policeman, something's wrong. - Patricia Alvarez? Why? What happened? - They called me out of school. The Alvarez boys are missing again. - Why is Donna dealing with the case? I reorganized the work a bit. Donna can stand the pace better. - Better than me? - And you have more time. - The family's things are better dealt with. - No children. - You have help at home. - Because your husband didn't die. You arrive exactly. Every single day. - Right? But we understand, believe it. - Really? He didn't really win. "It would be good to work less and have more with your kids." "Certainly Patricia Alvarez will not speak to such a woman." - What kind of a woman? - I mean, you know me. I've been dealing with the family for four years, I know everything about kids. Patricia trusts me because I'm a mother too. I look at what's best for kids. Okay alright. Then do it. However, if you go out to them, only with a policeman. - No escorts. - You're going with you. This is not a wishgranting show. - Sorry. "Enough to go without help, right?" Of course, no problem. Everything is alright? Well? Where are the boys? - Ma'am, open it! - No, trust me, let me talk to him. Patricia, what about the boys? They're in a safe place! I don't know what's going on here, but it's much better to clarify with me. So get in and reassure me that everything is fine with the boys. Don't worry, he's waiting here. All right? I'm just going in. Not! I told him only me. Nade... what would your husband do now? He was a police officer too. Would you let him go alone? Yes, he would. - I'll be here. - Thank you. I don't understand what this is all about? Where are the boys? - If you started drinking again or you feel bad... - Shit! Who is...? What is that? Do you hear something? They cry. Go away. Go away. Carlos? Tomas? - Get out of there, fast! - Patricia... - Get out! - Tell me why you closed it? - Nasty! - Patricia, please, I just... Get lost! - Please tell me what is... - Get out! Don't open that door! Patricia, stop right now! - Don't open the door! - Relax! Don't open the door! - Calm down! - Don't open that door! Leave me alone! My goodness. Here you close, fast. He will hurt you. No, he won't. I promise. Boys, I took care of everything. So you will be where you sleep, you get hot food, and you can hang out. All right? God... That's what happened? He did it. Did your mom do that? No. He wasn't. Your moms love you, do you know? Whatever the problem, we'll solve it, okay? You'll be safe tonight. I'll give my word. We're not safe anywhere. Hey! Sorry it's so late. - What was in the school? - Nothing special. Well, hi. Kiss. - There is a meat meal for dinner. Chris warmed up? - I do not know. Hey? He warmed. - Okay. And where is Chris? - Dad plays in his study. You can still look a little. ... the suspect fled. I went to persecution. I think I see it! There is! I'm close. I'll get it right now! I'm asking for confirmation! Bum! Bum! I'm asking for confirmation! Open fire! Stop! Bum! Bum! Bum! I intercepted. You got the suspect. They succeeded. We got him. Maternal! I've been bathing! Coming! I'm here already. It can go. - Rinse. - Rinse... Catholic charity hostel Tomas? Tomas? Tomas? Tomas? Tomas, why did you come out? Come back! - Hell? - Here's Cooper. Now we pulled out the Alvarez boys from the river. We're at the corner of 4th and Mitchell. All right, I'll leave you. Stay in the car, okay? And don't wake your sister. I'll be in a few minutes. Come on. Oh, my God. It's terrible. What happened? We found them late. They drowned in water. "You've seen them recently, right?" - And they were fine. Of course, they were scared, but they were fine, Coop. - I promised them they would be safe. I promised... - No, don't hurt yourself, please. My sons! My sons! - My sons! - Calm down, ma'am. You're wrong! My children died for you! Your sin! I wanted to stop him! But I tried it in vain, did not leave! Who? Who wanted to stop it? The Mourning Woman. My son. Sonny. Son... come on. I will never leave you, I will be with you forever. My son! Sam, Sam, let me in! - Open the door, you hear? - Chris, what? Open it fast! What about you? You haven't seen it? Who? Chris, what happened? Chris? Hi, I'm here. Everything is alright? ... Yes. Yes I am fine. Nothing wrong. Are you sure you have no trouble? No, I think I just imagined. Well. Sleep. Good night. She's a shaman. The smoking is an ancient ceremony. The body is first freed from all evil, so that it can flow and get good energy. And you believe in it? Does it matter what I believe? They believe in it. And if you believe in this, then... They must also believe in it. Did you know the boys? Yes. I'm child protection. - Can I ask you something, Father? - Yes. Did you hear the curse of the Mourning Woman? I haven't heard this name since my childhood. The Mourning Woman. It was an exceptional beauty. She was the most beautiful woman in the Mexican countryside. Then one day, a wealthy, handsome farmer arrived in the village. She liked her right away. They lived happily together. Two beautiful children were born, they were very fond of. Then... after a while... the woman caught her husband with a younger woman. - And what did he do? He took the man he loved the most. He killed his children. In a jealousy attack, they drowned them in the water of the river. When he realized what he was doing, he became a terrible guilt. And he threw himself into the river. Since then he has been wandering on Earth and looking for children in his sons. Tell the little ones to be good. Accept the elderly. Then the Mourning Woman comes and kidnaps them. So, is this a fairy tale? Somebody's. Here it is. This often preserved the darkness. - Always keep with you. "Oh, thank you, but I'm not... my husband was religious." It's not religious... ... you can still have faith. Chris! Chris! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam? Sam... What happened, honey? Good sky, what about your arm? I fell. You could have been big. Pay attention... I know how difficult it can be for you now. Also, the world sometimes looks awful. Do you remember what dad always said? When it wasn't with you and you were afraid... ... he said to tighten Mic with you as much as you can. So what about Mici? That's a little better, isn't it? What are you looking at? Here's Coop. Come. Come on, honey. Was it a hard day? Can we watch TV? Of course. Ã–..., proszit? - It's such a day, huh? - Seven. - Month? - Year. I don't know, I'm sorry, just... I need a little... Time. Yes. - And sometimes you need a little pizza. Thanks. - Willingly. So, if you are not in a lively atmosphere right now, then let's lie. Oh, no, what is it? Let's talk about Patricia Alvarez. I'm sure he's got to do with the death of his sons, but he's alibi. Several members of the congregation saw him when his children disappeared. - Really? - You know a lot about it. Look through your material. Maybe I missed something. I'd love to help, but the woman doesn't want to talk to me. Well, that's it. Because you're angry with you. - The first thing I learned from your husband is... - The angry people are talking. Chris? What are you doing? Chris... Hey, what about my heart? Chris? Hey? Are you okay? Are you ok sweetheart? Chris? Chris? My heart. Hey! Wake up! - Wake up. - What happened? You went to sleep first. Oh, baby. No problem. Nothing wrong. Come on, come on, let's go. Sleep on. Is anyone here? Just because my husband is a cop and can get home in any minute. Chris, wake up! Open it out! Open it out! What are you doing in my house? What are you doing in my house ?! Get out of here immediately! Maternal... What happened? Nothing nothing. Nothing, nothing. Don't be angry, but now you're here. Come on, come on. Exceptionally, you are sleeping with mom. - Chris, take your feet off me. - Okay. District Police District No. 27 What? Patricia. Please accept my sincere condolences. I... I can't imagine what you can feel. What do I feel? Now nothing. After such a tragedy. I give up... I don't care what they do to me. You should sit here for me. You killed my sons, not me! Rotten killer! - He locked the boys in a closet. - I hid them. That he can't find him. But he took my sons! They're with him. Little ones. What happened to your arm? What happened to you, Patricia? That woman... Your children... They've heard his fall. Have you ever seen the scary shadow? Then they will. Soon... come for them. Do you know why? Because I told her. - No, Patricia, this... - You know, when my sons... died. I did not pray to God for their salvation. I'd rather pray to him. I prayed... and I prayed and prayed to give my sons back to me and take my kids! Sam? Sam? Sam? Chris! What is that? Chris! Chris! Well, you did this well. Cooper, good evening. Is it wrong? - Did you speak from the hospital? - Yes. Control. Samantha, how did you burn your arm? "And what happened to you, Chris?" - I've already said I fell. This is true? Where were your moms? - Anna, you know you can't be here. - Come on, Donna. - They're protecting you. - They say right. - I would never hurt my children. - You're right. You can't be here. No matter how incredible, I don't enjoy this situation. I promised my abbot to look after you. If I can help you, please call me. All right? We have released Patricia Alvarez freely. We don't have enough evidence. Maybe he's not the culprit. What do you mean? - I do not know. All the same. - Anna. Whatever is going on here is over. Dad, for the first time in my life, I'm in love. - Then that's... - Hi. And he loves me too. Chris. We talk? I want to know exactly what happened. - I saw a woman. - Here in the house? Samantha's room. I thought Sam was, but... She was in a white dress. And just crying... he wants us. Let her be our children. Oh, Mom, it hurts. Rinse. Do you believe me? Yes. Of course. Sam! Sam? Sam! Let me in! Not! Sam! What happened? What happened to you? Are you okay? What was that? Sam... - Sam. - Mom. Mom... mom, mom! Get out! Run, fast! I know it sounds incredible. A few years ago I didn't think so. In legends, tales... In the night-sheltering creatures. Then... something happened. With a baby. Now I accept that there is no explanation. Would you help us? In such cases, the church always asks for help from experts. - I understand. - But... We can only contact them through Rome. - And how long does it take? - At best, they approve an order in a few weeks. There is another option. Unofficial, but I know someone. But if you choose this path, I have to follow the rules of the Church. That is, I cannot deal with the case. As I said, this man has other tools. The Church, well... he has his own methods, and he has the same way. That's why a couple of years have gone by. - So, was he a priest? - Yes... and now he calls himself a healer. As a shaman, he confuses religion with his own science to say so. That's a quiver. Don't touch anything, okay? - Good day, sorry. - I've seen you. The Alvarez boys' funeral... right? - Yeah, I was their caretaker. "Well, if they just came to look at it, I didn't get it." I'm busy. I understand. I think we came to the wrong place. Sorry, we're going. Have you ever seen such an injury? - Yes. - But what is it? - Ask a priest. - No, no, no, please. A priest sent us here. But... it's the Church's job. Please. This is the work of the Mourning Woman. So, they've seen it. - And you saw it? - No. Never before. Only what he did to others. - So what happens now? - It's a very rough, evil force. But he's not a living man. - Right? - No. Though it was. Until the murder instinct was digested. It became an unclean soul. Unholy, God refused. - I can't do that. I'll take them to a motel. - What? She must have her children. Not your house. No matter where they go. Follow yourself. What do we do now? - I don't think this is the solution. - No. Not only that. The funeral... â€œI saw you talking to Father Perez. - You said you were a priest. My journey began in the Church. Yes... But it was a long time ago. Let's go to his house and see him. - We are ready. "Excuse me, but I just do everything with eggs?" It seems ridiculous, what? Enough. Come with me. This ceremony is "La limpia". Brings evil. If it is present. The more blood, the greater the evil. I rise up in power, Lord Almighty, in the call of the most holy Trinity, in the Trinity religion. In the universe-creating unit. Protect us who are here. Protect us from Godless and evil. No, it's a magic trick. I just saw on TV recently. Maternal... Tada. Did you see this on TV? No. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. It's important that we do it in a coordinated way. The Mourning Woman is really in her darkness. Be prepared. The cross was carved from original Mexican wood. She has red flowers that she looks like she's flaming. Larbo del fuego. That is firewood. Allegedly, the firewood sobbed when the woman choked her sons into the water. Because they were only witnesses of their sins, they have a special power over them. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. What is that? - The tears of the Mourning Woman. Hallowed. - Why? This is the antidote. - Another ceremony is coming? - Does not come. Breakfast for dinner. David did it too. Breakfast for dinner. I was always jumping because he could not do anything outside the arsenal. But now... they deserve a fine dinner. After which they went. And what else is coming. - It doesn't sound too good. - I trust. God. "Father Perez says he turned his back to the church." - To the church, yes... God... never. Tell the kids. The flame should be monitored. If it is constantly burning, we are safe. Will you come here? It's already here. - What is he doing? - You're already looking. But what? U.S. Maternal! Mom! The Father... ... in the name of the Son and of the Holy Spirit... Rafael... Help us! My sons. Maternal! Maternal! Maternal! Maternal! Chris! Maternal! Sam, help me! Don't go! Sam, help me! Noo! - He said we'll be safe! Protect us! - Naturally. - Mom! He'll kill us! - Don't talk about that! You're hitting us. What are you talking about? - Did we do everything unnecessarily? - No, it's not. - We got upset. - Are you crazy? - Play with us? - I did what I had to do. To get the evil out of this house. What are they? Do you remember the firewood? Those seeds. They have to stay constant. And then it doesn't get there. It is forbidden to touch. Because you're sure to do anything to get here again. - To the back door! - Chris! - Fast, hammer and nails! - You're gonna get in! Don't let me in! Not! Leave the spirit! You can't hurt us! Close it, fast! Sam! Come immediately from there! Maternal! I got Mici. I didn't touch the seeds. Sam, Sam, Sam! Sam! He wants to stifle into water. Jesus, the pool. Sam! Not! Maternal! Blessed are the Almighty Lord, the God and Father of Jesus Christ! Come and bless us eternal God! Protect us with water sanctified by the tears of this demon and give us strength with this sacred water! Amen. Help! - Well? - Yes! Breathe, it's alive! How did you do that? There is now holy water in the pool. We managed to push it out for a while. Thank you honey. Honey... Are you okay? Sam... Sam! Sam! What about you? Sam? What happened? Rafael. What is his problem? His daughter was first under the influence of the spirit. If you call him, your daughter will go. If you manage to drive away from here forever, you cannot influence it. But we can't leave them until then. What is that? What's in your mind? Let's hear it! What shall we do? - Do you really have to? - Yes. But only until sunrise. Well. That is, sit down. Sam, my heart. You're a brave guy. Dad would be very proud of you. As you take care of Sam and me. I'd like you to know it's not bad if you're scared. Everyone is afraid sometimes. Me too. Your father was scared. Rafael? - No. - He's lying. I love you mom. I, too, baby. I love you so much. There will be no trouble, Mom. Close. Where is this chain from? His. - His? - He was on it. Take care of it. Maybe it could come. - Mom! Maternal! - Chris! - Chris! - Mom! Maternal! Patricia? - Patricia, Patricia, please. - She took my children from me. - Don't do this. - He brings them back to me. Patricia, don't do it. I beg you, no. Please put the gun down. All right? Lets talk about it. Let's talk calmly, okay? Please put it down. I beg you to bring my kids back! - No. - Give back my sons! Nee! Noo! Maternal! Maternal! Come! Closed! - Let's see this! - Chris, are all closed, what should we do? Quickly Chris! Come on, Jesus! Quickly open it! You can be here at any moment! - I know! - Pull down! We did it! Go, go, go! Hurry! The rope! Here! - Get the flashlight! - You got it. This! Don't mind! Follow me! Not! Oh no! Get behind me. Help! He'll take my kids! Nee! Release them! Release them! Go. Chris! Sam! - Kids! - In the name of the Almighty Father, I command you to leave the spirit here! Maternal! Anna! Tada! Come here. Nothing wrong. It's over. Thanks for everything. I don't know how to reconnect. You were very brave. Even I was a little afraid. - Seriously? - No. Not serious. Well, who comes first?
