I'm sorry. Would you mind if I had a drink? This is a very unusual and very... disturbing case. Now, we need to break into your thought patterns. Hmm. Stop the symptoms before they appear. You seem to have been having dreams. Anxiety dreams. Not normal in the circumstances. Though there's nothing particularly normal about these circumstances. This... is where your thoughts are. Yes? And you are able to describe this in more detail and accuracy than your own bedroom. Please tell me everything. From the beginning. You're amazing. Oh, don't smoke. They'll know we've used the room. - It's fine. - It's not, with your concierge friend losing his job over our hookups. You're not hungry? - No, you have it. - Raw fish. That's for you. You like sushi. We better tidy up and get back to the bank. At bank, we get some sushi. We can't be late today. - I've gotta leave early. - Why? We can't keep doing this. I know. It's doing my head in, too. I keep having to buy George Manchester season tickets. This isn't a joke. Not for me, anyway. All right, I'm sorry. Hmm? I know I'm not sensible as boring Ben. But we're good together, huh? Yeah. With a hour a week we get to spend with each other. Leave Ben, and we can start seeing each other properly. And maybe we can even live together. Where? Your entire flat is smaller than this bedroom. Or we can get a bigger place together. With what? You've been in that job seven years, - and you're still broke. - Well, you're earning all right. I can't just leave him, Rob. We need a plan. Thought for the future. What future? Exactly. Why're you leaving early today? We're going to a wedding, in Dorset. I do hope the weather holds out for you. Rob... You've got a sweetheart, you know? I'll see you at work. Bro, where've you been? I thought we were doing lunch. Look, don't, all right? I just got dumped. It's always something, isn't it? - Yeah. - All right. Meet me here for dinner after work, all right? Okay. Well, Ms. Gueller, thank you so much. And if you'd like to follow me... Another migraine, eh? Sarah not back from lunch? Not yet. Any calls? Yeah, Sharon from HR. She asked if you could give her a call back. Wonder what I've done this time? - Robert. - Hi. This young lady would like to set up a safe deposit box. It's in the amount of £50,000 cash. It's already been counted. She set up the account, there's the number. Um, still waiting for approval on this. So, let's give it off the register for the time being. - Certainly, Ben. - Ms. Gueller, - it's been a pleasure. All the best. - Thank you very much. Hey. Thank you. It's a lot of cash to be carrying around. What do I know, huh? You're a sight for sore eyes. - How are you? - Great. Um, lemme just go and get your receipt, okay? Uh, yeah, so we'll look after the cash for you once all the verifications, you know, ID, address have all been approved, okay? Um, we'll be in contact with you on Monday. - Okay, great. Thanks, bye. - All right. - Robert. - Yes. I'm leaving early today, so if you wouldn't mind locking up the shop, that'd be great. - Yeah, no problem. - All right, have a good weekend. - Yeah, you too, Ben. - Don't be long. I'm sorry about earlier. It's just... I think you could be brilliant if you put your mind to it. - Um, Sarah... - Let me finish. If things were different, if your situation were different, then, maybe we... I have to go. Um, Patricia, would you, um, mind putting away these I've just gotta go and pack my stuff up. Please. Thanks. What're you doing? Um, I was just, uh, locking up. Have you got your stuff? We can go. Okay, yeah. I'll just get it. You all right, Patricia? Yeah, Trish, you know, it's a bit late to get the tube. Why don't you jump on a taxi? - See you on Monday. - Yeah, see you Monday. Hey, bruv, I think I'm coming down with something or so, I might just slope off again, early night. Oh, no, you don't. Me and you are goin' for dinner, we're gonna have a catch-up. Where'd you wanna go? Your choice. - Park Chinois. - Come on. Well? - How's the family? - Yes, they're good. They, uh... They ask about me? The kids do, yeah. So, uh, what about this married woman, then? She, you know, went back to her husband. Actually never left him. I didn't get that far with her. Didn't make the grade. Well, you more than made the grades. You're too good for a situation like that. Yeah, well, it suited me. How's your financial situation at the moment? Uh, yeah, good. Yeah, I should be able to pay you back soon. - Everything. - I don't care about the money. I just wanna know that you're looking after yourself. I'm fine. I've got my job. - Got my flat. I'm okay. - Are you? - Yeah. - You smoke too much, you drink too much, you gamble. I can't be the only person you owe money to. It's not like you can even come over anymore, because you've burned every single bridge you got with the family. You just seem to make one bad decision after the other. - Like, dating a married woman... - Hey! I'm not gonna stand here and get lectured by you! Hey, I looked after you. Literally, for both Mum and Dad when we were kids. So, just back off. Let me make my own choices. Your mistakes, more like. Just forget dinner, all right? And go home to your wife. - Does she even know you're with me? - Yeah. - Oh, what, she knows we're goin' to dinner? - Yes. To the most expensive Chinese restaurant in London? Yeah. I didn't think so. Thanks, bruv.

Tomorrow, I want you to take a flight to Amsterdam, and exchange this briefcase for a suitcase. Then you can come back to London with that suitcase. You book a hotel. You text the address to the number in this phone, and ditch the phone in the canal. And at that particular address, somebody will contact you for the exchange of the cases. - What's in the cases? - It's better not to ask. You'll get a 6:00 a.m. flight from Heathrow. And if I don't do it? Then we're not friends. You deal with the consequences yourself. I pay Li the $12,000 now. And when you come back with the suitcase, you will receive this £150,000. Plenty there to pay your debt. Okay. Oh. This man is my friend, so I take care of his debt now. We'll give you the briefcase tomorrow morning. We'll get it through UK customs. But you have to deal with Amsterdam security. If you lose this case, or the suitcase that you pick up... your life will be on the line.

Look, could you give me a call when you get this? This, um... This is important. Um... Sorry, I think you're in my seat. - Sorry. - That's okay. Uh, you've left your case. No, that's yours. - Sorry, do you mind? - Um... You need to put the briefcase in the compartment, as well, sir. Can I keep it on my lap? I've got some things I wanna read during the flight. Okay, just pop it under the seat in front of you, if you would. So, off to Amsterdam for a fun weekend, eh? - Yeah. - With friends? No. I must've read that magazine 50 times cover-to-cover. Oh. I travel so much with my work, I always bring my own reading material. I, uh... I don't wanna be rude, um, but I didn't get much sleep last night. I could really do with some rest. - I'm sorry. I've been blabbering. - That's okay. Ever since I started in airline security, I spend a lot of time by myself. No bother. Airline security... That sounds interesting. Yes. It's my job to identify suspicious-looking passengers. Terrorists, um, drug smugglers, that kind of thing. I mean, we're, uh... I mean, we're safe? Right? I mean, there's no terrorists on board, or drug smugglers? No, there's no terrorists here. So, what's that symbol on the front of your briefcase? - What sign? - That one. - Looks, what, Chinese? - Oh, I hadn't noticed it. Um, this is my brother's case. Um, probably just means that it was made in China. Most things are these days. Well, it's all double Dutch to me. - Come with me. - Hey. We can cut the line. Really? Where're they going? This man's with me. Go on. Sorry, excuse me. Would you mind if I go in front? I'm in such a rush. Sorry, excuse me. Um, thanks for getting me through back there. Oh, thanks aren't necessary. I'm glad I was able to help. Look, can I offer you a lift? - Oh, no, no. Um... - It's really no trouble. - I have a car waiting. Come on. - Oh, okay. Get in. It's fine. I'm sorry, Robert. I haven't properly introduced myself. I'm Herbert Summers. How do you know my name? Are you sure you don't know what this symbol means? No. Well, it belongs to one of the largest. Triad gangs in the world. And this case with this symbol indicates to other Triad members that it can be received. I haven't been completely honest with you. I don't work for airline security. Well, then, who are you? I'm a special agent with the DEA. - Oh. - We work in collaboration with other international agencies. Interpol, Europol, Scotland Yard. Right now, we're tracking one of the most important heroin conduits that's going into the United States. And the key man to that smuggling operation is a gentleman by the name of Lau Hoi Ho. - Sound familiar? - Yeah. Well, you should. He's the one that gave you this case. He's the UK head for a Triad gang called 14K. And this briefcase is full of the highest quality counterfeit money in Europe. And, you, my friend, have just been used as a mule. Now, if I opened it, I would have to send you to prison. But you don't worry. We're looking for bigger fish. What we do need for you to do is make the exchange. But they'll kill me. Not if you do exactly what they tell you to do. But that means I'm smuggling heroin. What if I get arrested? I could lose everything. Fuck! Look, I told you we would take care of you if you cooperate with us. We'll record your every move in Amsterdam. We'll film the exchange. I can help you get across the UK border with this case, like I did here. But you must take the heroin to Lau. And then what happens to me? You cooperate with us, you testify in court, and walk away as a free man. And this little act of misjudgment on your part will be forgotten. We'll protect you, Robert. Your hotel. How do you know that? So, what's it gonna be? I don't have a choice, do I? Not really. Look, just do exactly what the Chinese told you to do, and leave the rest to us. Okay, let's go. Hi, um... Sorry, do you speak English? - I'm sorry. Can I help you? - Yes, um, I've booked a hotel room, and it's the same address as here. Um, I'll get my phone for you. Ah, yeah. Um, at the back, downstairs and Gerrie will help you. - Where are you from? - England. - England. Liverpool, Manchester? - London. Hmm. London. Here, you smoke? - No. Thanks. - Come on, you should try. Okay. Um... what can I do for you? Yeah, I've made a reservation. - Ah. Name? - Uh, Robert Atkinson. Uh-huh. Are you alone? Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, but the room has been double-booked. What? Don't do this to me. Um, look, I've paid in advance. Um, lemme show you. Can you hold on for a minute? Yeah? Well, you can show me whatever you want. But I know my rooms are sold out. Huh? But that's okay. I'll give you an upgrade. There's a very special place on the canal. Oh, I'll make a call. This place is like a palace inside. It's a lot better than here. It's just around the corner from here. You really should explore the nightlife in Amsterdam. - You can have great fun. - Okay. Yeah, this place is gonna take your breath away. It's really special, and you'll like Vera. Yeah, she's blue-blood. You British like that, huh? But Vera is different, you know? She... She really appreciates this city, - all its beauty and all its flaws. - All right. And the art she has there... Come on, come on. We gotta go. It's really wonderful... So, we now even have vegan... We've got everything. Chicken, beef, vegan. Well, this is the place. What? No. This place is massive. Yeah. You have no idea. It's very exclusive. - Yeah, but I'm not paying any more... - No, no, no, no. You don't have to pay anything extra. It's our mistake. Me and Vera, we always look after each other. It's been taken care of. Eddie, hi. Well, this is the gentleman. Oh, yes, yes. I have a very nice room for you. - Great. - Thank you, Vera. Well, have a good time, Robert, huh. Oh, wait, I have something for you. Wait. Whoa! I won't need to go to the gym tomorrow. Oh, and please do come and try one of my special burgers, hmm? - They're the best in town. - Okay. Yeah, will do. - Come in. - Hi. This place is amazing. It's certainly an upgrade from the burger joint. Oh, thank you. I'm glad you like it. How much do one of these rooms normally go for? Oh, this isn't a hotel. Come. Gerrie is an old friend. I help him out when he's overbooked. Can I have your passport, please? I just need to make a copy of it. I'll return it later, if you don't mind. Yes, of course. Uh... - Here you go. - Thank you. These paintings are great. I have the largest collection of this artist. You see how the frame isolates to content of her paintings from the outside world? Huh! What, the artist is a woman? Oh, yes. Yes. I love that you can almost see the layers of its history. Like a kaleidoscope. But it isn't about history, or family, or love, or... It's about the only certainty we have in life. Impermanence. Oh, yeah. It's closest to the kitchen, in case you need anything. If you smoke, please use the garden. Is that all your luggage? Uh, it's just a short visit. Well, this is your room. It's fresh and clean. If you need anything, I'll be upstairs. Thank you. Uh, sorry, Miss... Oh, Vera Tribbe. But, please, call me Vera. Okay. You're different from other men. No one's ever said that about me before. Just make yourself comfortable. A yell, and I'll be here in a flash. Papa, please! You're hurting me. He can hear you. I don't care. I want him out of here now! - Papa. - You hear me? Yes. Are you awake? Well, I am now. May I come in? Uh, one sec. Did I get you in trouble? It's just my father. I... I didn't realize I was intruding into a family home. I'm sorry. Me and families don't really do too well... No, no, no. Not at all. Please. I'm sorry for his behavior. No, honestly, it's fine. Are you hungry? Uh, I was just about to eat something and I thought... Well, I thought maybe you could join me? Um... Sure. Thanks. Make yourself comfortable. I'll bring dinner and something to drink. Great. Thank you. So, here we are. Oh, great. Thank you. Let me get that for you. - Wow, great place. - Thank you. Cheers. Hmm. Help yourself. Bread and cheese was a luxury at one time. Potatoes sustained this country through the war when we had nothing. People would walk miles just to eat tulip bulbs. - Really? - Hmm. Well, I just realized I haven't eaten since yesterday. What is that? This knife is from the fourth century. It's been in my family for generations. Try it. - Do you like it? - Yeah. It's good. So, why are you in Amsterdam? Are you interested in any of our museums? The coffee shops? The red light district? Oh, no. Not at all. We had to build up the city after the war, only to watch tourists use it as a brothel. Those poor women are used until they're nearly split in half. Yeah, but, it's legal here, right? So that is why you're here. No, no. I just mean it's part of the economy. Well, men have their needs when a wife can't fulfill them. Look, um, I uh... Sorry, I've just remembered something really important. Do you have an adaptor for a British plug? I need to charge my phone. No. Right. Well, then, I need to get one. This is really important. All the shops are closed now. What, really? Nowhere's open? Look, I'm sorry, okay. This cannot wait till tomorrow. But wait, uh, Gerrie may have one. I'll call him. Great. Yeah. Brilliant. If you could. Hey, Gerrie. It's Vera. It's your lucky day. - He has one. - Are you serious? He's out on an errand. He'll bring it later. Look, if... If you want me to, I can ask Gerrie if he's had any cancellations when he gets here. - No, no, no, please. - I don't want to be any trouble. You're no trouble. I like your company. My father, he... He doesn't mean to be rude. It's not his fault. Uh, could you show me where the garden is again? - I need to... - Oh, yes, yes. Of course. Great. So all this space for just you and your father? Yes. And he spends most of his time in his room, huh? Yes. All the time. Do you never get to take him out? Never. And have you always looked after him? Always. So, no children or husband? No. Do you have a job? No. I was hoping to study art restoration, but I just look after the house now. Can't leave my father alone. You could go. I mean, leave your father. Why? Well, it just feels like you're kind of like a prisoner here. And go where? - My father is a good man. - Of course, he is. Certainly sounds better than my father. My father was a brute, to me and my mother. My little brother managed to escape it, but me and my mum weren't so lucky. - What did you do? - Nothing. When he felt like it, he just lashed out. Usually after he'd had a drink. My father was very affectionate with me when he drank. What do you mean? He had no wife. - He needed my love. - What? Shh. He might hear us. Are you afraid of him? What did he do to you? Shh. Please. You know what, you should leave. Just fuck him. Don't talk about him like that. Who are you, coming into his house, enjoying his food, his wine, his bed? Maybe you are like the others. I... I'm sorry. Hey, I shouldn't have said that. I've got a really hard day tomorrow. I should get some sleep. Wait. I'm sorry. I'm... I wanna show you something. Isn't it beautiful? My father had it built specially when he renovated the place. Take a dip. It's very relaxing. Oh, no, I've... Not brought my trunks or anything. Please, I feel so bad that I snapped at you. You've got trunks. Okay. He'll be asleep now. I'll go and get more wine. No, Papa! Please! I told you to get rid of him! Please! Thank God. I thought you were your father. He's not coming down here, is he? Look, I don't understand. Do I have to leave? I want you to stay. Here. Hmm. It's my father's wine from the cellar. Chateau Lafite Rothschild. It's nice. He would get so angry if he knew we were drinking it. Like your father. Yeah. Also... My father's dead. So, my father's good with money. Yours isn't. I'm not feeling well. What have you done? What have you done? I don't feel... Oh, hi! Vera, did I wake you? Of course not, Uncle. I'll be right back. Well, I was worried. You know, I was standing outside, and ringing and ringing. Aw, you brought croissants! Did you hear what I just said, Vera? I was waiting outside. Yes, yes, yes, sorry. I was in the kitchen. No need to worry. Well, okay. Okay. - Coffee? - No. Not for me, thanks. I won't be staying that long. Hmm. Vera, are you sure you're okay? - Yes. - If you need anything, anything, just call me. Yeah? I know. - What's that on your dress? - What? Oh. I was grinding some meat. Rabbit. Well, you said you were going somewhere? Yes. I'm off to my club, actually. Okay, my sweetie little niece. Do be careful. You know how much I care about you, hmm? My father was right. You are like the others. But I can cleanse you. No! No! Stay still, please. Thank you. What? Don't do this, please! Let me go! Help! Don't! Try not to move. Hi. I'm looking for Robert. Hi, I'm sorry, but there's no one called Robert here. I know he's staying here. There's nobody here. Please go away. Where's Robert? I don't know who Robert is, I swear. I know he's here. If you don't tell me where he is, I will take out your eyes and then your ears. Do you understand? I'll count to three. One! - Two, three! - Stop, stop! He's here. He's here. - What have you done with him? - Please. Nothing. I'll take you to him. Please. Now! He's in there. Open it! Hurry up! It's stuck. Move! I fucking hate disturbances. Yeah, do your thing. Hmm. I told you not to move. Please, don't... Please, don't do this. Please. Vera. You can let me go. Please, don't do this. You're all right. You're safe now. Something went wrong. Neither of them answered my calls or messages, and they never left the house. We need to get in that house. But how? She has nothing to do with your operation. The mission's over. Lau walks free. We are so close. I know it's slow progress, but we can't stop now. You did the right thing. Just hang in there and we'll get Lau. We can put him in prison. But not for murder. He'll get what he deserves. Locking him up doesn't free us from men like Lau. Locking him up allows us to pump him for information. We'll cut the head off the snake and save innocent lives. Lau will pay. You'll have your revenge. - Hi. - Hi. What's the emergency? It's your brother. Robert and £50,000 in cash have gone missing. - What? - He closed the bank on Friday. I was with him as he closed the bank. Was he carrying anything? Just his bag. I'm not going to lose my job over this. And I don't want to get your brother into trouble, but I need that money back. Now, the police are on their way to pick up the security tapes. - So... - I'll find him. - I'll expect to hear from you by the end of today day, yes? - Yeah. Excuse me. He went to Amsterdam. He sent me a photo. All right. Forward it to me. - If you hear anything, let me know, okay? - Okay. Thank you. Chief Vanderbilt, these two people haven't just vanished into thin air. They're still in the house. I would be out of a job if we entered a particular house without any solid evidence. You need a warrant and I cannot give you one... I'm missing my key witness. That's Albert Tribbe's niece's house. That family is the most powerful family in the city. And I don't think they really need to get involved in narcotics. - I don't think it's about narcotics. I think it's about... - Whatever it is, it's out of bounds, Mr. Summers. Then let me speak to the uncle. I don't think you are understanding this. This city is my jurisdiction. And I'm telling you to stand well away from the house and the family. And if I see you anywhere near her house, or her uncle, you will be arrested and on the next flight to the US. Hi, uh... I was wondering if you'd seen... If you'd seen this man? He was in here last Sunday night. Wait here. Get off me! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Wallet, now! Here, take it, take it. It's yours. What is your connection with Robert Atkinson? He's my brother. Why are you looking for him here? Uh, he's been missing since Friday, and this is the last place he was seen. - Have you called the police? - No. Smart man. You have a nice family. Your brother is doing something for me. Because as a friend, I helped him. But it appears he has betrayed... What was he doing for you? So now, you go to Amsterdam to find him. And make sure he comes back with what belongs to me. - And what is that? - You ask me too many questions. If you don't come back with your brother and my property, I'll be paying a visit to your wife and kids. Yeah. I need to speak to my wife. Tell her I'm... No messages to anyone. Go. My assistant will meet you at Schiphol. Hey, Rob, it's Steve. If you're there, mate, please pick up. I don't care what you've done. I just want to know that you're all right. I'm so sorry I didn't pick up your call. I'm coming to Amsterdam to get you. Yes. Yes. But, sir, we're so close. I can't be sure. He's disappeared, off the grid completely. It doesn't make any sense. But we can get into the house another way. Yes, I do know how much this case costs. That's why I'm saying we have to keep going. We're almost there. I think you're making a mistake, sir. We almost have him, please. Yes, Chief. I understand. Steve Atkinson? - Yes. - Come with me. Are you with Lau? Where's my brother? Let's go. Hello, Steve. My name is Herbert Summers. I'm from the United States government. I work with the Drug Enforcement Agency. We've been investigating a major Chinese drug-trafficking operation, and your brother was helping us. What? You know where he is? Jun Hui works undercover for us. She followed him to a house, and he never returned. And that was the last we saw of him. We've been monitoring every exit. He hasn't left the house. And I cannot get through to him. Wait. What was he doing for you? Your brother was set up. We stepped in and he agreed to help us. Set up how? Your brother lost a poker game. And in exchange, your brother agreed, although I must say, unknowingly, to smuggle heroin for him. That's why he left me that voicemail. Ah, I ordered for the three of us. - The best in town. - Thanks. Robert actually booked a room here. Although it seems that the owner took him directly to the house. Has anyone been into the house? It's owned by one of the wealthiest women in the city. She never leaves her property. She's like a recluse, or a hermit. So why haven't you just raided the house? It's the most powerful family in Amsterdam. Local police don't want to get involved, and we just don't have the jurisdiction here. - So now what? - We have a plan. And you're gonna help. It's okay. Hello? Hi. Um, we received a photo from a friend who stayed with you a couple of nights ago, and we were wondering if you had a room we could rent for a few nights. Hi. Um, there is no one staying here. I'm sorry. Um, Robert texted us this address, didn't he? Yeah, yeah. He, um... He even sent us a photo of the room. It looks so romantic. Robert said we'd love it. Well, you better come in then. He was right. This house is beautiful. Sorry. No pictures, please. Oh. Of course. This way. Wow. Can't imagine how Robert could afford to stay in a place like this. Well... It's 200 euros. Each. Thank you. May I have your passports, please? Sure. I'll make a copy and return them to you later. Thank you. Thank you. So, are we the only guests, then? Yes. I'll show you up to your room. This is your room. It's a shame that Robert had to leave. Yeah. When did he go? Yesterday. If you want to smoke, please use the garden. Thank you. You live here all by yourself? Sort of. My father, he lives upstairs. He's ill. It's like living alone. Have a lovely stay. This was Robert's room. This is Lau's briefcase. He gave it to Robert. What the hell is in it? It's all here. Hey, keep an eye out. Papa... Are you awake? Of course I am. Who are you talking to down there? Guests. Papa, I think one of them is... Is who? We might have a problem. Come in. I can help. Think, child. Have they been truthful with you? Have they asked you awkward questions? - But Papa... - Vera... my daughter... Beware, even those who look innocent can be dangerous. - Sorry about the noise. - What happened? She left. Some people are never happy, no matter how much you do for 'em. Hmm. You want a drink? Yeah, thanks. Tea? Maybe something stronger? Give me five minutes, I was about to help my father - into bed. - Okay. She's asked me for a drink. Have you found anything? - Not yet. - All right. Keep the line open. I'll try and keep her talking so you know where she is. Here you are. Thanks. - Was that your girlfriend? - No. Cheers. So, how long have you been together? About two years. Wow. She's very lucky. If she's not careful, she'll lose you. She's just a bit upset. She'll come around. Mm-hmm. Why don't you come and see the garden? Yeah, sure. Wow. It's nice. So, what did you argue about? Uh, it was nothing, really. She'll be back soon... As soon as she's spent all my money on a bunch of rubbish. You're good with money? Your father taught you well. My father? Not really. My brother is, though. Hello? Always looked after me, always protected me. That must be nice, having someone to protect you. How about another drink? Yes. Of course. Jun? - Pardon? - Table for one, sir? No, no, no. Thank you. I'm here to meet someone. Excuse me. Sir, you can't... Mr. Tribbe. Herbert Summers. May I have a word, please? I'm sorry, Mr. Tribbe. It concerns your niece. It's okay. Please. I'm with the DEA. We're tracking a heroin-smuggling operation into Amsterdam. And, I'm sorry, how does my niece fit into this, Mr. Summers? I've got a table of friends waiting. Our man was working undercover. He's disappeared. He was last seen going into your niece's house. You know, lots of people disappear in this city. In fact, they come here to disappear, from their wives, their fiancees. They usually turn up after a couple of days. - You look in the clubs? - Mr. Tribbe. I'm so sorry you have been bothered with this. We'll take you straight to the airport. Mr. Summers is leaving now. Mr. Tribbe, please. Look. My God. It's okay. You tell me everything. - Everything all right? - Mm-hmm. Fine. Cheers. Cheers. Ooh! It's strong. What is it? My father's cognac. Do you like it? Yeah. It's great. Good. Why are you here, Steve? Really. Wh... What? Are you here looking for your brother? Hmm? What have you done? Steve! Steve, wake up! Steve, wake up! Hi. What are you doing? What are you doing? Take it off! What the fuck are you doing? Let me go! You sound just like your brother. What did you do to him? What did you do to him? You'll see. No. No, no, no! - Help! - Get away from him! Stop, stop! Please, please! No! Fuck! Get off him! - Yes? - Help! Vera, can I come in? - Coming. - Help. Fuck! Time's up. Can I come in? Yeah. Sure. I know about your father. What do you mean? I know you didn't mean it. And he was strict with you, but he did love you. I know. I know he loved me. When Mother died, he married me. What do you mean, he married you? He had no one else. And someone had to take care of him. And I loved him. But then... But then he... He what? Then he took our child away and drowned her in the canal. He said it was his and he could do whatever he wanted, but... But it was my child, too. No more baby. I'm so sorry, dear... But it's for your own good. Hey, arrest her. What have you done with them? Where are they? Vera, you know I'll always take care of you. But now you have to tell me where they are. Open this door. Open it! No, no, no, no. Please. Come on. Jun! Steve. Down there! Hey, Jun? Jun? Jun? - Jun, are you all right? - Help me out, man. Find me the keys. Jun? - Quickly! - Got 'em. Just a second. It's okay. You're all right. You're safe now. Just go with them for now, and this will all be over shortly. I'm gonna need some sample of those buckets, - check for DNA. - Yeah. Send a team to Gerrie's bar. Arrest him. Shut the place down. See you. They did a background check on Gerrie. Turns out that he actually worked for Vera's father. Long list of priors including attempted murder. When he got out of prison, he couldn't find any work, so he went to Vera for help. She actually bought him that burger joint... In exchange for services. - You okay? - I want to go home. Just take them to the hotel. I will send a doctor over there. Thank you for everything. I'm sorry. You'll be okay? Yeah. Hey. Have you thought about what we said last night? There's no other way? No. I wish there was. Look, Steve, I know it's dangerous. But unless you make the exchange, they're gonna come after you and your family. What if I pay him the money he gave to Robert? For Lau, it's not about that money. Your brother was supposed to smuggle heroin for him. And that's much more valuable than the money he lent Robert. Several million on the open market. Look, Steve, I... Don't worry. We'll take care of you. Like you did with my brother? Fine. I'll do it. The exchange will take place this afternoon at Schiphol car park. The brother returns. I believe that's yours. Well done. I had my doubts, but it appears you came through. So that's it? Robert's debt's paid? Yes. We're even. Yeah. Even. I heard about your brother. Terrible way to go. Armed police! Get your hands on your head! - Armed police! - Don't you move. Whatever you say may be used as evidence. Do you understand? Piss off. Do you understand what I'm trying to say to you? Sergeant, cuff 'em. I am cautioning you. You have the right to remain silent. Any evidence used against you will be used in a court of law. You have a right to legal representation. If you do not have a lawyer, we'll provide one for you. - Moving one! - Please move two. I need to thank you for everything you've done for us. I don't think we could've done it without you. Thank you for everything. I'm finally free. No person should have to take on the sins of his family. There was nothing you could've done to prevent it. We can choose any road. Even on the wrong path, sacrifices will be made, and justifications. One bad decision leads to another. This was his road that he chose. The best advice that I can give you in this case is that you need to forgive yourself, and your parents, and your brother. Forgive yourself. Papa... - Did I do well? - Oh, you did, you did. But don't allow any more strangers to come here. - Harry. - Vera. - Good to see you again. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - New traveler? - Uh-huh. Please come in. Okay, Tom. Have a nice time, huh? Okay.
