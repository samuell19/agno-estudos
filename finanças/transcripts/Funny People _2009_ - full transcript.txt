pulled me from the clay Set me on a rock Called me by Your Name And made my heart whole again Lifted up And my knees know if s all for Your glory That I might stand With more reasons to sing than to fear You pulled me from the clay Set me on a rock Called me by Your Name And made my heart whole again Here I stand High in surrender, I need You now Hold my heart, now and forever my soul cries out Hold my heart, now and forever my soul cries out Once I was broken But You loved my whole heart through Sin has no hold on me 'Cause Your grace holds me now And that grace Owns the ground where the grave did Where all my shame remains Left for dead in Your wake You crashed those age-old gates You left no stone unturned You stepped out of that grave And shouldered me all the way So here I stand High in surrender I need You now Hold my heart Now and forever, my soul cries out Once I was broken But You loved my whole heart through Sin has no hold on me 'Cause Your grace holds me now Healed and forgiven Look where my chains are now Death has no hold on me 'Cause Your grace holds that ground And Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now

grace holds me now Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now Healed and forgiven Look where my chains are now Death has no hold on me 'Cause Your grace holds that ground And Your grace holds me now Your grace holds me now I’ve been strong And I’ve been broken within a moment I’ve been faithful And I’ve been reckless at every bend I’ve held everything together And watched it shatter I’ve stood tall and I have crumbled In the same breath I have wrestled And I have trembled toward surrender Chased my heart adrift And drifted home again Plundered blessing Till I’ve been desperate to find redemption And every time I turn around Lord You’re still there I was found Before I was lost I was Yours Before I was not Grace to spare For all my mistakes And that part just wrecks me And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love Somehow this kind of love is who You are It’s a grace I could never add up To be somebody You still want But somehow You love me as You find me Who am I To think Your glory needs my praises But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord Take it all You are faithful and You are gracious And I’m just grateful To think You don’t need a single thing And still You want my heart I was found Before I was lost I was Yours Before I was not You wear the scars For all my mistakes And that part just wrecks me And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love Somehow this kind of love is who You are It’s a grace I could never add up To be somebody You still want But somehow You love me as You find me You love me as You find me You love me as You find me You love me as You find me Your love’s too good to leave me here If You want my heart I won’t second guess ‘Cause I need Your love More than anything I’m in I’m Yours Your love’s too good to leave me here Your love’s too good to leave me If You want my heart I won’t second guess ‘Cause I need Your love More than anything I’m in I’m Yours Your love’s too good to leave me here Your love’s too good to leave me If You want my heart I won’t second guess ‘Cause I need Your love More than anything I’m in I’m Yours Your love’s too good to leave me here Your love’s too good to leave me And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love Somehow this kind of love is who You are It’s a grace I could never add up To be somebody You still want But somehow You love me as You find me If You want my heart I won’t second guess ‘Cause I need Your love More than anything I’m in I’m Yours Your love’s too good to leave me here Your love’s too good to leave me If You want my heart I won’t second guess ‘Cause I need Your love More than anything I’m in I’m Yours Your love’s too good to leave me here Your love’s too good to leave me Precious blood Has left me forgiven Pure Like the whitest of snow Powerful to make sin And shame retreat This covenant is making me whole So I will rise And lift my head For by His mercy My life was spared The highest Name Has set me free Because of Jesus My heart is clean Purify my heart In Your presence Teach me To discover the joy Of holiness that forms As You draw me close In You what was lost is restored So I will rise And lift my head For by His mercy My life was spared The highest Name Has set me free Because of Jesus My heart is clean So I will rise And lift my head For by His mercy My life was spared The highest Name Has set me free Because of Jesus My heart is clean Because of Jesus My heart is clean My soul thirsts For things I can’t explain In my bones A beckoning to pray If my heart is a battleground My defences run both ways The flesh is a beggar And thief But there is a Spirit-man Awakening me When real life And peace won’t make amends When all these starts Start feeling like these ends Like the world is unravelling And I’m bound to come undone There is a Shepherd A Priest There is a Comforter Who comforts me And my soul finds rest Where it makes no sense There the blood sets me free All my old regrets All my brokenness All my failures redeemed And it feels like grace Where I stacked my shame There the cross stands for me All the things I’ve done All the times I’ve run All my dead ends redeemed And it looks like hope Where my heart was broke And His heart broke for me Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Lay your burden down upon Down upon Him Lay your burden down Jesus my rest in peace My reconciler You’re my every good thing I surrender all All I’m living for You’re my every good thing You’re my amnesty You’re my split wide sea You’re my every good thing All my days and nights You’re my death to life You’re the wonder I breathe You’re my can’t explain First and last refrain You’re my every good thing O how high would I climb mountains If the mountains were where You hide O how far I’d scale the valleys If You graced the other side O how long have I chased rivers From lowly seas to where they rise Against the rush of grace descending From the source of its supply Cause In the highlands and the heartache You’re neither more or less inclined I would search and stop at nothing You’re just not that hard to find I will praise You on the mountain And I will praise You When the mountain’s in my way You’re the summit where my feet are So I will praise You In the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful When the night leads me astray You’re the heaven where my heart is In the highlands And the heartache all the same O how far beneath Your glory Does Your kindness extend the path From where Your feet rest on the sunrise To where You sweep the sinner’s past O how fast would You come running If just to shadow me through the night Trace my steps through all my failure And walk me out the other side For who could dare ascend that mountain That valleyed hill called Calvary But for the One I call Good Shepherd Who like a lamb was slain for me I will praise You on the mountain I will praise You \When the mountain’s in my way You’re the summit where my feet are So I will praise You In the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful When the night leads me astray You’re the heaven where my heart is In the highlands And the heartache all the same Whatever I walk through Wherever I am Your Name can move mountains Wherever I stand And if ever I walk through The valley of death I’ll sing through the shadows My song of ascent Whatever I walk through Wherever I am Your Name can move mountains Wherever I stand And if ever I walk through The valley of death I’ll sing through the shadows My song of ascent My song of ascent My song of ascent From the gravest of all valleys Come the pastures we call grace A mighty river flowing upwards From a deep but empty grave So I will praise You on the mountain And I will praise You When the mountain’s in my way You’re the summit where my feet are So I will praise You In the valleys all the same No less God within the shadows No less faithful When the night leads me astray You’re the heaven where my heart is In the highlands and the heartache all the same This is holy This is holy ground You are holy You are holy God This is holy This is holy ground You are holy You are with me now I wait upon You now Lord I wait upon You now Let Your presence fill me now As I wait upon You now This is holy This is holy ground You are holy You are holy God This is holy This is holy ground You are holy You are with me now My heart cries holy My heart cries holy This is holy This is holy ground My heart cries holy You are holy You are holy God Oh Jesus This is holy This is holy ground You are holy You are with me now I wait upon You now Lord I wait upon You now Come on Lets wait upon him There’s a grace when the heart is under fire Another way When the walls are closing in And when I look at the space between Where I used to be and this reckoning I know I will never be alone There was another in the fire Standing next to me There was another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding Of how I’ve been set free There is a cross that bears the burden Where another died for me There is another in the fire All my debt left For dead beneath the waters I’m no longer a slave To my sin anymore And should I fall in the space between What remains of me and this reckoning Either way I won’t bow To the things of this world And I know I will never be alone There is another in the fire Standing next to me There is another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding What power set me free There is a grave that holds no body And now that power lives in me There is another in the fire There is another in the fire There is another in the fire There is another in the fire And I can see the light in the darkness As the darkness bows to Him I can hear the roar in the heavens As the space between wears thin I can feel the ground shake beneath us As the prison walls cave in Nothing stands between us Nothing stands between us There is no other name But the Name that is Jesus He who was and still is And will be through it all So come what may in the space between All the things unseen and this reckoning I know I will never be alone I know I will never be alone There’ll be another in the fire Standing next to me There’ll be another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding How good You’ve been to me I’ll count the joy come every battle ‘Cause I know that’s where You’ll be And I can see the light in the darkness As the darkness bows to Him I can hear the roar in the heavens As the space between wears thin I can feel the ground shake beneath us As the prison walls cave in Nothing stands between us Nothing stands between us Even if he doesn't I will praise Him Even if he doesn't I'll stand tall Even if he doesn't I'll praise Him Even if he doesn't Even if he doesn't I'm not bowing to this world Even if he doesn't I ain't changing my confession or my belief or who I believe in Even if he doesn't Oh I'm gonna sing louder then ever I'm stand longer then ever I can see the light I can see the light in the darkness As the darkness bows to Him I can hear the roar in the heavens As the space between wears thin I can feel the ground shake beneath us As the prison walls cave in Nothing stands between us Nothing stands between us There’ll be another in the fire Standing next to me There’ll be another in the waters Holding back the seas And should I ever need reminding How good You’ve been to me I’ll count the joy come every battle ‘Cause I know that’s where You’ll be I’ll count the joy come every battle ‘Cause I know that’s where You’ll be I’ll count the joy come every battle ‘Cause I know that’s where You’ll be I’ll count the joy come every battle ‘Cause I know that’s where
