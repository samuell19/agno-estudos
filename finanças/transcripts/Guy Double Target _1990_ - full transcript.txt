It's romantic, you know Raina, why do you suppose this party's gotten so out of control? But to him it's just a game Are you implying it's my fault? Two rash, adventurous hearts If you're going to do party tricks, at least do them right! Two rash, adventurous hearts Suddenly, they come together It's a whole new universe It's a hazardous escape Catch! It's a hazardous escape He tosses you a kiss along with his smile Feeling lucky? He tosses you a kiss along with his smile Best hand gets to chart the course until we hit the next spaceport. He tosses you a kiss along with his smile Best hand gets to chart the course until we hit the next spaceport. But the joke But the joke Is on you Okay! Is on you Then, open! Then, open! It's a hazardous rendezvous It's a hazardous rendezvous Sorry, Guy! But there's never been such a promise But there's never been such a promise It could happen any time What the?! It could happen any time So fall in love! Four lucky cards in a row. So fall in love! It's a hazardous escape I think that means I win. It's a hazardous escape Are you allowed to do that? It's a hazardous escape Are you allowed to do that? And you can't dodge your feelings for him Guy "He who makes the rules, does what he damn well pleases. " And you can't dodge your feelings for him Guy "He who makes the rules, does what he damn well pleases. " You'll have to move fast You'll have to move fast Or go mad It's a hazardous rendezvous And there's never been any hope before It can happen any time So fall in love! Fall in love! Now then, since I've got the controls... Our next target should be a challenge. G UY PLANET FREZON Dammit all to Hell! Can't you drive any better than this, Guy? Enough whining! Unless you want to be as fucked over as this road is, you'll keep your mouth shut. As long as we're being so sociable, would you mind explaining what sort of treasure brings us to a screwy planet like this? Look over there. What the? Hey, that's... Isn't that the place on all those universal peace and love pamphlets? The Floating Palace of the People's Free Church of Frezon? A good guess. It's also the location of our current target. You're not kidding me, are you, Guy? I'm completely serious. There's a heavy payoff waiting for us in there. They call it the Golden Goddess. A goddess made of gold? To those believers who dwell in the path of shadow, hear now the wisdom of Arcana. To those who have not yet found the true path, Iisten to the words of Noima. The eve of the promised miracle is at hand. Tomorrow, as the three moons of Frezon converge at their zenith in the midnight sky... The combined rays shall illuminate our Golden Goddess in a shower of holy radiance. Then, the seals within the Goddess will be released, freeing that within once more. And we, the chosen acolytes, will become one with the gods. The Golden Goddess was discovered among the old ruins. Its archaeological value alone is astronomical. So, through the antiquities market, the payoff would be awesome. And if worse comes to worse, it would still make quite a few gold bars. What's the matter, Guy? Blood... I can smell it. How awful! This explains what I smelled anyway. What do you suppose happened? I don't know. Look out, Raina! That wasn't so difficult. Raina! Guy! Quit fucking around! Use your gun, or do you other trick! Dammit bitch! Ask to become an honest woman while you're at it! What's that supposed to mean?! It means that things don't always turn out the way you'd like! Why you! Out of my way! Remind me not to ask you for any favors again! Damn, wouldn't you know it? Raina, let's get out of here. Guy! Guy, what were those things? Damned if I know. But at the moment, we've got a more pressing appointment with a golden treasure. Lady Arcana! Lord Noima! Lady Arcana! Lord Noima! Lady Arcana, Lord Noima, please help me. I, a poor orphan girl with no parents, beg for your help. When my parents died, I was taken in by a relative, a cruel and evil man who abuses me daily. I throw myself on your holiness' divine mercy! I beg you, please help me! You cause more trouble than you're worth, bitch! Get your worthless carcass back to the house. It's him! It's my evil relative! So, this is what you plotted in that pea-sized brain of yours. You fucking moron! You're not supposed to shoot me for real! If I don't make it look good, someone might notice. Unless you want some serious trouble, you'll keep out of this. It is our holy duty to defend those who cannot defend themselves. What the?! Guy! And now, my little lost lamb, you must come with us to the palace in the sky. Lord Noima! Lady Arcana! Well, dammit... Those assholes aren't what I expected. From this day forth, you shall dwell in our house. You shall be freed forever of your earthly bonds. Take care of yourself, Raina. Finding the treasure is up to you now. Raina, you better not screw up on your end. I'll be having enough problems just dealing with all this damn moonlight. Lady Arcana, the leaders of the flock request a conference. What should I do? Noima... Lady Arcana? My Lady Arcana... Will it be difficult? How can you worry about such a thing? By tonight, we will possess the greatest power in the history of our order. Not just this one planet, but the entire universe shall be ours. Noima, l... Arcana... More! More! More! Harder! Time to fly! Busy, busy, busy! How gratifying to see Frezon's heads of state gathered to hear my simple advice. As you know, your regions have been donating forty percent of their GNP's to our holy cause. However, it is now my considered opinion that this amount is insufficient for our needs. Therefore, all donations shall be increased to sixty percent, effective immediately. What?! Is she serious?! Now then, where would I be if l were a Golden Goddess? "Your considered opinion, " my ass! This is extortion, pure and simple. You and your "peace-loving" followers are a cancer, H..Hey... You and your "peace-loving" followers are a cancer, devouring the very future of our planet! That monster! It's the same as the one in the village. Yesterday, one village died. Tomorrow, this unbelieving fool's city and his people will suffer the same fate. Now then, is there anyone else who cares to contest my opinion? What the hell?! I'm playing house with a bunch of psychopaths. Right, here we go! This way. None shall pass without authorization. Prepare to die most unpleasantly. What a bunch of morons. As if I'd really get suckered by that trick again. Oh great one, Goddess of Gold, grant unto your chosen servants the ultimate power! The intruder shall not penetrate any further. Stop him at all costs! Yessir! Well? Did we get him? Damn! A brand new set of power armor all shot to hell. Raina! Raina, are you all right? Guy... The treasure is this way. Right! Way to go, Raina! The three moons are becoming one! Our moment approaches. Soon, we shall be gods ourselves. I hate to interrupt your fascinating conversation, but I'm afraid I'll have to take that Golden Goddess off your hands. Dog of an unbeliever, you speak boldly, but your sinful flesh and blood shall serve us well, as a first offering to the goddess we awaken. It is for that reason alone that you were escorted here. Well, whatever turns you on, I suppose. Come on, Raina, the treasure's as good as ours. Raina, what's your problem? Raina?! Can you hear me? Raina, you hear only our commands. The time has come to slay your friend, to feast upon his flesh. Taste the salt of his blood on you lips and suck the marrow from his bones. Now, Raina! Raina? Raina... The joke's gone far enough. No one can resist the power that is ours. Guy, your only chance of surviving is to kill your whore first. Kill him! R..Raina... Don't, please. Guy, help me! I'll kill you if you don't kill me. Stop me, Guy! How delightful! We control the body, but the soul is aware and writhes in torment. I'm tired of playing with them. He sacrificed himself for her. What manner of man is he? Not man enough to handle this! It doesn't matter how much you resist. Against our power, you cannot win. I shall disembowel the girl you tried so hard to save, and drape your corpse with her bloody viscera! Raina will... Raina will not be harmed! You will not touch her! After all we have done, you still defy us? Either he's an idiot or a complete madman. Prepare to beg for mercy, you swine! What the?! Lady Arcana, look! Noima, we must complete the ritual. Right! It is time. Now is the moment for which we have served and sacrificed. Now we shall rule the universe, and my first act will be to crush the unbeliever beneath my heel. The time has come to die, infidel! G..G..Guy... Damn you to Hell! Where are you hiding? You cannot escape! Your soul is promised to the goddess. Now, infidel, die! Hold it right there! Guy! Lady Arcana, escape while you still can. What are you saying? You cannot leave me. I regret that I am unable to follow your orders, Lady Arcana. Noima! I do not understand. With the power of gods, how could we be defeated? Arcana! Damn you! Guy! It is time for you to learn what it is to lose everything you hold dear! Guy, don't think you've won so easily. Fool, this entire encounter was merely foreplay. Guy... About those two... I wonder what they planned to do? Once they conquered the galaxy, I mean. I don't know. Personally, I'd rather just be rich than the master of the universe. Yeah, me too. I wonder when we'll find the treasure we're looking for? Speaking of treasures, Raina! Why in the hell did you have to blast the Golden Goddess?! Why did l... Because if I hadn't, you'd have been a big, blue Guy-pancake, you stupid dork! Shut it! I had everything under control until you started poking that knife around! You arrogant, oversexed... Want to make something of it, bitch?! Why you... Harping, neurotic little... Over-inflated bag of ego on steroids! What are your hands doing on my breasts?! Let's be serious! Would I really want to touch a boy's breasts?! Who are you calling a boy?! You, of course! It's so warm In this dream I've found myself living in I was alone In the night With the darkness creeping in As I lay My body pressed Cold and tight against the glass The voices from The heavens came Wafting down My heart says go for it And I reach out my hand Yet, when it seems I should have it It's out of my reach Oh, lonely way I'm stranger Now discovering A new land Oh, lonely way I'm stranger I'll try any way To get there that I can Through a narrow, too confined space Fighting against the wave of time I find we've reached All that I sought When I was still seeking Despite the bleak Grey urban streets I see reality with my eyes I've a mirror world Inside my mind That will not fade away But if we break that mirror Will it let my feelings out? Would they fall as shooting stars In the midnight sky? Oh, lonely way I'm stranger Now discovering A new land Oh, lonely way I'm stranger I'll try any way To get there that I can This old and used up husk Still harbors a burning flame Together, we can do anything Let's walk on through Oh, lonely way I'm a stranger Discovering a New land Oh, lonely way I'm a stranger I'll try any way To get there that I can
