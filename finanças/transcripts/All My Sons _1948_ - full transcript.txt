Almost like old times. The Pinano still sounds good, Despite the way Larry and I used to punish it. You think of him? - You see Joe?… she still thinks of him. - What do you mean, Kate? It’s just that you remember him. - He’s in your thoughts. - That’s a funny thing to say, how can I help remembering him? - I.. I’ll take you up to your room. - I’ll see you later, Annie. You must be tired after that long train ride. I put in mind that it was fun coming home again. -Have you slept? -No, Icouldn’t, I was too excited. A room that doesn’t look out on a court, what a relief! - No kidding, mom, isn’t she the sweetest girl you ever saw? - How did I know, you’re having me believe in it?

Would you do me a favour Joe? Stop being helpful! That was my potatoes - I thought it was garbage. - If you’d make up your mind that every bag in the kitchen isn’t garbage… You wouldn’t be throwing out my vergitables. - Last time it was the onions. - I don’t like garbage. Then stop eating, When I was a little girl in the old country, A bag of potatoes was like a bag of gold. Where’s Annie? She’s changing a dress. - I wish she hadn’t come. - Why not? - People will ask questions. - Let them. - Only you ought to know the answers. - What questions? What answers? Good thing she comes here. Let people know there’s no grudge. What passed is passed, a good thing. I like that girl. She has guts coming here. - No flies on her. - You like every girl. Well, no files on me either. Don’t move, everybody. Say, Annie, I don’t noticed it before, But you’ve got pretty legs - Joe! - But she has. Joe’s getting gay, Kate, You must do something about him. No fool like an old fool.

Yeah, and how? Oh, I think you’d be interested in this Annie, It’s Larry’s horoscope, Kate asked me to work on it. - I sent for a chart. - Horoscope for what? You see, the point is… If February 9th, is the day Larry disappeared, was favourable day for him… Then it is completely possible he’s alive some where. Because he couldn’t have been killed On his favourable day Fables! Oh sure, just because you don’t believe in it, there are lots of things you don’t believe in and the true is just the same.. This isn’t something I make up, you know, It’s all in the stars. Been going on forever. - Annie. - Lydia, it’s so good to see you. Having babies agrees we, Which one is this? Meet my latest, We call ‘em Rupert after Frank’s Grandfather, I think it’s so awful. - What’s so awful about it? - Oh, Frank,the toaster won’t work again. - I fixed it this morning - Oh, I know honey, but fixed that’s the way it was. Do you…how’s your brother? George is fine, He’s got his own office now. Full fledged lawyer without clients. And your dad, is getting along all right? - I don’t know. - Does he expect a parole soon? Frank, you better go back to the house, I left Gertrude in the kitchen… When I get to think sometines, how an intelligent man like your father can be put in prison… - When all gangesters running loose all over the country? - Cut it out Frank!

I don’t know how she finds the time with three kids. - Haven’t they stopped talking about it? - Nobody talks about it anymore, Ann. - On this way. - God, I’ve forgotten, kid, believe me. - How do you think I stayed here in business, while they didn’t? - But it’s different with you, you were exonerated. Annie’s father’s still in prison, She might as well be prepared. People do talk about it. The only one who still talks about it is my wife, I think she’s sorry that they let me go. It certainly was more peaceful In the house while you were away, I’d say that. - Oh, there, didn’t I tell you? - Gosh, it’s wonderful to hear you laughing about him. - Doesn’t seem so awful when you laugh about it, does it? - Sure, what’d you expect? Say, I’ve got a great idea,Why don’t we all go out to the lake tonight and have a showed dinner like we used to do? - All of us together? - I think it will be just fine. - what do you say Annie? - I’d love it. - You got out business, I’ll call up Swanson’s to reserve a table. - Oh, no, no, you don’t, this is my party, I’ll do the calling.

So he is. - Good evening, Mr Keller. - Hiya Henry, Where were you keeping yourself? - Where are we anyway? - That’s enough for now. That’s the best around the floor. - Would you teach me that step? - Not bad, huh? Murderer! Oh, safety first, eh? - Oh, that’s great, Pete. - Nothing but the best for you Mr Keller, - Anything you want, just call up for it. - Don’t encourage him! Mr Keller can have anything in the place. - We don’t see him often enough, like the old days, eh Mr Keller? - No, not like the old days. Big shot, eh? Didn’t know that your old man hasn’t brought to tell you, you used to go around me, kid when we go places.

Can’t think of his last nam, nice fellow. Hey, you’re doing this all wrong, you’re missing the best part, let me do it for you. - I could never eat lobsters right. - Then you dig in like this, see… … And then you twist it like that. - It’s all ready for eating. - It’s too big, Joe. - So, this fellow goes home unexpectedly and… - Who goes home? - This fellow. - This better be good. It’s good. Oh, this fellow goes home unexpectedly,he did knock on the door, nobody answered, so he goes round to the back… Joe, look who’s at the bar. Everybody is a point killer around here Who’s at the bar? Mrs Hamilton, she’s drunk too. -- So what? - Oh, so it’s nothing, she’s always drunk. - Who is Mrs Hamilton? - Oh, A lush, that’s all, she worked at the factory for a while… …during the war, as an extra Her husband was killed in the invasion… in France -Oh.. - Will you let a man finishes his story? So nobody answers the door and he goes around to the back.. - He climbs in the window… - Joe… she’s seen us, she’s coming that way You’re making me a big thing out of nothing. Pay no attention to her, that’s all, she’ll go away. Oh, when he gets inside… … there.. wearing his own pajamas, and smoking one of his best cigars, met this guy… …he said “Pardon me, I didn’t know I was home” - Murderer. - Hey, cut it out, you hear? - Murderer! - Hey, cut it around… - Murderer! - Joe! - What’s going on here? - Get out of here, quick, out! It’s all right folks, Everything is all right, go back to your tables, please. - I’m sorry Mr Keller. - Don’t care, Pete. She does that every time she gets drunk, Sees around enemies, she’s got some kind of crazy fog in her head - Done me no hurt, sit down. - Joe, let’s go home, I don’t feel so good. Yes, please, let’s. Okay. Go along to the car, All of you, I’ll pay the cheque. See you outside. Annie... - You’re not letting that upset you, are you? - No, I guess the things aren’t just the way I thought they’d be. - Perhaps I should have come - That’s what I’ve told Chris. - Mom.. - Kate’s right. She’s not right, You had to come because This is where you belong. Now, look… Liten to me Annie… You do like I did, and It’s gonna be all right. The day I come home after the trial, I got out of my car. But not on front of the house, Oh no, on the corner. You should have been here, You too, Chris, you could’ve seen something. Everybody know that I was out that day, Nobody believed that I I was really innocent. All portions were loaded. So I got out of my car, I walked down the street. But slow, and with a smile on my face. The beast.. I was the beast. I was the guy who sold defected cylinders to the army’s air force. I was the one who made 21 air crashes in Australia. . Well, no kidding, Walking on the street that day was something But I walked, passed the houses, passed every single one of them with my head up. Result: 14 months later I had one of the best shops in state again, a respected man again, bigger than ever. - I’m afraid I haven’t the courage Joe. - Oh, this is the only way, to lick ‘em with courage. You gotta have guts. Every Tuesday night, The a whole patch playing Poker in my office All that who yield “Murderer”, trying to take my money from me. Annie, the worst thing you did was to move away from here. And then it’s gonna end when you move back. The people start playing cards with your dad again, and… Smile with him, talk with him. Play cards with a man you know we can’t be criminal.. Next time you write to him, I’d like you to tell him this what I said. But I don’t write. - Well, he’ll be now… - Neither does George. But why? Because he did murder 21 pilots That’s why! - What kind of talk is that? - No thing to see about that man. When they took him away, I followed him. I went to see him every existing day. - Until I read in the News about Larry, and I stopped. - But what your father did has nothing to do with Larry. Nothing. Because he’s not dead, do you hear? - He’s not dead! - Now, Kate, please.. Kate.. He’s not dead. I think I’ll go to bed. There is some cold things in the ice box. If anybody’s still hungry. And some grape juice. Listen, Annie. There’s no proof that Larry ever flew one of those planes. Who flew them? Pigs? Liten, the man was a fool, but don’t make a killer out of him, you’ve got no sense? what does it do to her? Annie, you’ve to appreciate what’s he doing in the shop in the war, I mean just try to see it human, Just see it human.. All of a sudden a batch of cylinders come out bad. Something might wrong, a mistake. But they ain’s murders. You mustn’t feel that way about him, do you understand me? - He didn’t have to ship them. - All right, so he shipped them, he believed that the whole of them a 100% good. The Major was screaming the deliverys are home sick so he shipped them, he shipped them, I don’t say it was right, he shouldn’t have done it. But it wasn’t murder, it wasn’t murder. - Let’s forget about it, Joe. - Annie… …the.. day that the News came about Larry… He was in the cell next to mine,your dad And he cried, Annie. - Cried half a night. - I guess the fathers of those boys cried too. Don’t talk like that. - I don’t understand why you… you…. - Are you gonna cut it out? - Chris! Don’t yell at him. We’ve had too much of that kind of talk. Eh… Chris is right, too much of talk about it. Now look, eh.., why don’t you two go driving or something? Stopping on a road house? What’s the matter with you anyway, Chris? Pretty girl like her has nothing to do sitting around here. - Oh, why don’t you mind your own business? - He’s right, Chris, let’s go somewhere. You see? What did I tell you? Too bad I’m not younger myself, Annie. - You’re just the right age - Oh, what you know, huh? - I’ll enjoy your competition. - Have a good time. - Enjoy yourselves. - Go to bed. Hello. Yes. It’s long distance, somebody wants to talk to Annie. - Well, she went riding with Chris. - Uh, she’s not in just now. Oh, an hour maybe. Who? All right, I’ll tell her. - It was George calling her. - George? From Springfield, Joe. - What’s he doing there? - Went to see his father I suppose, what else? - But Annie said they haven’t been in touch. - That’s what I was thinking This is Operator four. Remember how we used to picnic here, You, Larry and I? - This is why our line of three was a crowd. - And you were too sensitive. - Are you still? - The army rob some of that off. Not enough, I’m afraid. - Chris, I’m not to stay. - Why? What’s happened? For one thing, Kate doesn’t want me here. - Oh, she doesn’t understand, she… - And.. ever since I got here, you’ve been a little… …distant… Am I embarrassing you by being here, Chris? - Why, no Annie, no.. - You act like that. Well. You see I.. The trouble is, I… So feeling working up to this point.. -I guess you know why I asked you to come. - I guess that’s why I came. Oh, I love you Annie, and I still love you a great deal. I love you. Gee, I have no imagination, and that’s all I can say, is that awful? I didn’t want to tell you here, I wanted to tell in sone place we never been at, some place we were brand new to each other. I kissed you, Annie.. I kissed Annie. I’ve long been waiting to kiss you. And I will make you happy, so happy. No, Not like that, you know. You kissed me like Larry’s brother, Now, kiss me like Chris. - How long did you love me Chris? - Always, ever since we were kids. And you never said anything or shoed it. You were Larry’s girl. You’re funny.

This is Ann Deever speaking, You’ve a call for me. Hello, George, it’s Ann, What’re you doing in Sprinfield? I can’t understand you, What are you so excited about? You’re not making sense.

All these years, He.. don’t even write to her. suddenly, goes to see him. - He’s a laywer now, Joe. - Oh, what’s that got to do with it. - Laywers love to dig up things - Well, let him dig, can’t scare me. - You’re sure, Joe? - Oh, sure I’m sure.

George phone you, Annie He’s at depot. - Here? - Yes, he wouldn’t take a Taxi to come out, he wants you to meet him there. I can’t imagine what’s gotten into him. I’m finding doc Jim Bayliss to go out and make him come. I’ll phone the station and see if he’s still there. If he’s coming to re-open the case, I won’t let through it, we can’t go through it again. Now, mom, don’t you just up all work of nothing, It’s not bad to make you out. So, if George goes, tell her to go with him. Annie’s different, mom. No matter what the others may think or do, she’s different. - He’s her father, too. - She’s different. You’ll see. He’s not there. Jim must’eve picked him up. I better go in and look after the dinner. No matter how much help you’v got, you must look after things yourself. She’s upset. She’s worried about George. She thinks he’s coming here to make trouble. George isn’t friendly, Chris. I might as well warn you, you’d better be prepared for a lot of wild talk. George can be such an awful fool sometimes. It won’t change anything between us, will it, Chris? No matter what he says. - No matter what anybody says. - Jim? Oh, have you seen Jim? I’ve been lookin’ for him. Yes, he went up to the station to pick up my brother, he’s just arrived. Well, how do you like that? If I ask him to drive me to the store, he hasn’t got the time If anybody else asks him, that’s all he’s got. - That’s what you get for marrying a big hearted guy. - Yeah! - Chris. - Yeah? - Come in here, please. No matter what anybody says. - I guess your brother’s coming to give the pride away, huh? - You mean people are guessing? Well, people come for two and two together. - What your father going to say to all this? - Why should he say anything? Well, why shouldn’t he? After all, Joe aren’t smarter than him, didn’t he? - That’s not true. - Oh, I’m sorry, Ann. You know me, I always talk too much. Have you told Kate? Not yet, it’s a lie, isn’t it, what you just said? There’s no person in the block who doesn’t believe it. But you know how people are, they always think the worse. It can’t be, they’re all on good terms with everyone on the block, they play cards all the time. They just give Joe credit for being clever, that’s all. I guess I do myself. Susan. I wanted to see if you can calm mother, she’s all worked out. Oh, did she find out about you two? - Why don’t you mind your own business?, go on and see what you can do. - That’s okay. - You’ll find something in the medicine cabinet. - I’ll give her two of everything, that’s all Kate will ever need. - She said they think Joe is guilty. - She talks too much. I’m not here out for blue sky, Chris. I turned my back on my father. - Is there’s anything wrong here now? - Hey, He’s innocent. Do you think I could be given to a guilty? Believe me, there’s nothing wrong for you here. - He’s outside in the car - Well, ask him to come it. - Take my advice, don’t bring him in here. - Why not? - I’d better see if I… - No, wait, I’d better go and get him. Why don’t you stop being an idiot? He came here to take Ann away, fight it out somewhere else. - Nobody’s afraid of him here. - Chris! - George. - Hello, Annie. Kate asked me to bring this grape juice up to you. Susie, this is Ann’s brother, George. - This is Mrs Bayliss, Jim’s wife. - Hello. - So, you’re George? …we’ll, I’m pleased to meet you at last I’ve heard a lot about you, too, I… Will somebody take this grape juice away from me so I can shake hands with the man? Well, it’s time that we have some new men around here. That’ll do so, we have to go. - Do we? - Yes. You don’t have to push me, I can take a hint. - Goodbye, Annie’s brother, George. - So long. - And thanks for the lift. - See you later. How about some grape juice? Kate made it specially for you. No, thanks. Seems impossible when I’m back here. - How’s the law, George? - I don’t know. When I was studying it seemed sensible, but outside it doesn’t seem much of a law. You’re not gonna marry Ann. - Why not? - Because his father destroyed your family, that’s why not. - Now, look here, George.. - Cut it short, Chris, tell her to come with me, let’s not argue. Who are you to come pulling her away like this, if you have something to say, say it. I went to see dad and told him you’re gonna be married, it seemed impssible not to tell him. Lately Annie, I’ve been thinking that maybe we’ve been wrong not to gp see ‘em, it’s been bothering me. Whatever he did, Annie, he’s our father. We’ve gotta remember that. That’s not what you said when you came back from overseas I know what I said and I did a terrible thing. I can never be forgiven, It was not our dad’s fault. - Joe knew about those cylinders, Annie, he knew. - That’s a lie and you know it. - He was home, sick. - Sick! he stayed home to give himself an alibi, so that all the blame would fall on dad. But all this came out in the trial, dad told the whole story, and jury didn’t believe him. The jury didn’t know him, Annie. Yesterday I heard it from his mouth. From his mouth, That’s all together different from the court record. Anybody who knows him and knows your father will believe it from his mouth. Your father tricked him, he took everything we had, I can’t beat that. But this I can, she’s one item he’s not gonna grab. Get your things and come with me. No, George, I’m staying here with Chris. Everything they have is covered with blood. You are not the kind of girl who can live like that. Georgie! Geortgie. My Georgie. Hello, Kate. Georgie, They made an old man out of you. - Well, I… - I told you when you went away, don’t try for medals. - I didn’t have to try, Kate, medals were very easy for me. - Oh, go on, you’re all alike. Look at him, why, did you see? He is like a ghost. What’s the matter with you, don’t you eat? It must be those restaurants. I feel all right, I.. just don’t have much apetite these days. If you eat in my house, you’d have an appetite. Wait till you see the dinner I’m spread out for you. I’m not staying for dinner. I’ve gotta get right back. Oh, of course you’re staying for dinner. I’ve never heard such nonsense. Now you stop telling me what you can do and what you can’t do. Going wrong making believe that you can hate us. You can’t hate us Georgie, not in your heart. I know you, you can’t fool me. I diapered you. You haven’t changed. Non of us have changed, Georgie. They’re all the same. - Why didn’t you give him some grape juice? - No, thanks. You always liked grape juice the way I made it. You came for it all the time. Don’t you remember? Now here, you drink it.. there. Kate… I’m felling hungry already. I think I’ll stay for dinner. - Nobody could resist Kate. - Why should he resist me? Georgie’s like one of my own, one of my very own. I practically raised you. You and Ann both. From the day your poor mother died. - Georgie. - Lydia. - What did you do to yourself? - Just grow up, I guess. You got prettier. - Here’s your hat, I just finished it. - Thanks, it’s lovely. She’s so clever, that one. - I heard you’ve a baby. - Oh, you know, you’re so good, I’ve three. - Three? - You’ve been away a long time, Georgie. - Getting to realize that. - You’re gonna be around for a while? - No, I’ve gotta get back tonight. - Oh.. Here goes my youngest again. He cries all the time. I’ve got to go. So long, Georgie. - So long, Lydia. - Be seeing you. - She’s got pretty, that one. - She makes things so nice around here. - They didn’t take Frank, huh? - He was already one year ahead of the draft. Whenever they called the boys of 27, he was 28 And when they made it 28, he was 29. I guess Frank won the war. Well, well, well, look who’s here? Well, good to see you. - How are you Joe? - Oh, so-so, getting on. - You look fine, George. - He looks terrible. Yest, that’s what I say, you look terrible, George. I wave a pant and she beats me with a belt. Oh, boy, I feel tired. - You stay too long at the plant. - Well, somebody has got to make the dough. - How’s your dad? Feel all right? - No, he’s not well, Joe. Oh, that’s too bad. That’s the way they do, George. Man makes a notice mistake, and they hang him by the thumbs. - I wish you let me know, you’re going to see him. - I didn’t think you’re interested Of course I’m interested, why shouldn’t I be? I think about him a lot. And I’d like him to know that as far as I’m concerned, any time he wants, he’s got a place with me. - Not as my partner of course, but.. a job. - You don’t owe him anything, dad. - Of course I don’t, I know that, but just the same... - He hates your guts, Joe, don’t you know that? Yeah… I imagine it. That can change too. - Herb was never like that. - He’s like that now. - That’s sad thing to hear. - Why? What did you expect him to think of you? Well, I think it can be sad even if you expected it. I expected it because I happen to know your father. I’m sad to see that he hasn’t changed. As long as I have known him, 25 years. That part of him made me sad. The man never learned to take the blame. - You know that, George. - Well, I… - Yes, but you do know it, good, by the way, you come in here, you don’t seem you remembered it. I mean, like in 37, when we had the shop mall in Flood street.. …and he may had blewed it up with that heater he left burning for two days without any water. He wouldn’t admit it was his fault either. I had a fire a Mechanic to save a space. - You remember that, don’t you? - Yes, I… - I’m just mentioning this because this is just another one of a lot of things. Like when he gave Frank next door that money to invest in oil stock. - I know, I.. - Well, it’s good to remember those things. The way he cursed Frank when that stock went down. Was that Frank’s fault? To listen to him, you think that Frank was a crook, and all the man did was just to give him a bad tip. - I know that! - Oh, remember them. Remember them. - Dinner is ready, everybody. - We’ll be right in, Minnie. You know..uh, there are certain men in the world Who just haven’t got the guts to take the blame. You understand me? Come on in, let’s eat here. Oh, this one says: “He can talk already But he can’t bark”! I made all the thigs Georgie likes, and he didn’t get anything. - Oh, no, not again. - Well, go on, eat.. - There’s much more in the kitchen, don’t be bashful. - Not bashful! Oh, mom operates on the thory, if there’s more food in the kitchen, you’re still hungry. You don’t have to be starving. Hey, Georgie, go on, take some, will ya? Leave the rest for me because I’m only jut started. Remember the time we went on a picnic and we took so much food that we stopped people on the road to give them sandwitches? Yes, it was a whole truck full of food, enough for an army! Well, I don’t like to let people go hungry. Anyway, it was only a small truck. - I could use you when I was overseas, you know? - Yes, indeed, me too. Wouldn’t be such a bad idea back, to have a mother go and feed the boys. - Mr Macey’s daughter, that’s the pearl for Georgie. - She’s got the hope in George. - Who’s Mr Macey’s daughter? - A drip! She’s not the drip, she’s nice, and very intelligent. - That’s a wrong thing to say, Kate. - Now you come back here to live Georgie in the way Joe says, then we’ll.. Yes, I’ll talk to judge Collins in the morning. Have him take you in with him. Great spot for you, Georgie. Talk to him in the morning. And I’d find a girl for you, who’ll put a smile at that face. I feel so… It’s so wonderful. I’ve never felt at home anywhere but here. Why shouldn’t you, Georgie? We have no argument. Why should we have an argument? We were all hit by the ame lightening, all of us. You know Kate? You look so.. so young. Now you haven’t changed the bit. It rings an old bell. And you too, Joe. You are amazingly the same. Still healthy and strong as an Ox. I haven’t got time to be sick, that’s for old people. - Joe hasn’t been to a doctor as long as I can remember. - I haven’t been a day sick in my whole life. Knock wood. - Is that a fact, Joe? - Yeah, Sure. Except for that time, when you… Oh, yes, yes, except for that time when I had the flu. - But I thought he had pneumonia, he couldn’t leave the bed. - Never sick a day, you said? - Not a day in your whole life. - George, please. - Did you remember every time you were sick? - I’d remember that time. - George! Especially if that was the day.. …when my partner was going to ship defective aeroplane parts out of the army. What happened that day, Joe? What happened?! George.. please don’t talk that loud, Minnie might come in. That’s enough argue, I had just about enough. I don’t have to tell you anything. Ask the court what happened in that day if you’re so curious, ask the court that set me free, ask the jury. It’s all written down on paper. It all says that I’m innocent, innocent! You had me fooled for a minute, Joe. For all this food, and your talk about jobs and girls. You had me fooled. - We’re getting out of here. - Listen George.. - Now, I’ll wait for you outside, get your things. I’ll go talk to him. Put the dessert in the ice box, we’ll have it later, Minnie. - I told you not to bring her here, Chris, she doesn’t belong here. - Why doesn’t she belong here? - Because she’s Larry’s girl. - She’s not Larry’s girl, Larry is dead. - He’s dead, and he can’t come back! - Now, cut it out, Chris! Never.. never in this world, he’s not dead. As long as you are alive, your father and I, he’s not dead, you understand? he can’t be dead! - What’s she mean by that? - Oh, I don’t know. - It was a funny thing for her to say. - You know the way she talks. - What’s the matter? what’re you driving at? - If it ever turned out that you weren’t telling the truth, I’ll kill you! What kind of a thing is that to say? What kind of… I don’t have to defend myself to you and nobody. Do you understand me? Not you and nobody! No hard feelings, kid. What kind of happiness you’re gonna have with all that rottenness upon me? Use your head Ann, it can’t be. George, I want you to go away from here and never come back to this house again as long as you live. Ann..? Wait for me, George. Don’t leave me, Annie. It’s no good, Chris, it’s no good. Sometimes.. you have to leave things the way they are, not disturb them. That’s what Kate said and she’s right. I’ve disturbed them too much all right. - Let me go with you. - No, Chris, no. - Let’s take a seat. - Thank you. You’ll be along for a minute. Chris.. You look fine, Chris. You’ve.. you’ve grown up. - Thanks..you look… - Oh no, don’t try to tell me, I’ve changed. Some ways for the better, Chris. Some ways for the better. Losted in here, gained in here, and here. - You always seemed to me to have pleanty of pelf, Mr Deever. - Not enough, Chris, not enough. Not enough brain, not enough heart. Un..no time to talk of me, boy, you’ve come about Annie, George was here and told me, you and Annie want to get married he said. - We’re not getting married, Mr Deever. - No? - Annie broke it off. George came to our house after he had seen you, And she went away with him. - Why? - Because he convinced her that my fater was guilty Well, I’m… I’m sorry for you, Chris. Very sorry. I don’t believe my father was guilty, Mr Deever. Go away, Chris. Go away and forget all about it, all about us. Don’t dig in to this thing. You’ll be hurt by what you find. - Go away. - I want you to tell me that dad is not guilty, it’s important My happiness and Annie’s happiness depends on your courage to admit the truth, admit it and free us. Chris.. as God is my witness, what I’m going to tell you is truth.. …We were in the mist of all that warbusiness, turning up to stock the army and navy, night and day, night and day, no end of it. Boys were going full blast, we wewe working from midnightto 17:00, we were going 24 hours for the rest of the week… All the stocks were taking their ways to the harbors, they were also becoming inspected. - Now hurry, security ware.. - To the offset again, as soon they returned out again.. - I don’t know anything about it, then get it inspected… - …They’re defected. - Defected? What’s the matter with you? Nothing can be seen with the naked eye, But it’s showed in the X-ray all right, I’ll have to reject the whole patch. What do you mean? You can’t do that! you can’t Reject it, it’s gonna be shipped out of here on Mondy morning, they have to pass. What can I do? They’re no good, I warned Joe, This has been the cutting process to apply. Joe, have you seen Stan? He said there’s something the matter with the cylinders. - Yeah, I know. - What happened, Joe? - What happened? They came out bad, that’s all, it happens, it came out bad. - Can’t they be fixed? No, not till it start all over again, But this time we’re out of business. We shouldn’t have got into this,where were our heads? we’re not big enough, we had no right to take on those contracts. I don’t remember you saying that when I came back from Washington with ‘em. You looked to (profits) to the bottom of the page and you thought they would be plenty big enough then. - I relied on you, you said we’re gonna handle it. - Oh, we can, if we could send this patch he says it came out bad. Stan is no lady, ever since they made him the army inspector and gave him that X-ray machine, he’s been saying things. - What we’re gonna do, Joe? - Oh, what can’t we do, take the wrap. We’ll ship them. Ship them?! How can we? Ship them, that’s all It isn’t the first time we’ve shipped stuff out of here that wasn’t a 100%. You think every stove we sent out of here before the war was perfect? Nobody turns out a perfect product. - But this is different, Joe. - Oh, what you wanna do? Not ship them and having cancel this up and pجut us out of business? You know what they’ll do to us if we don’t deliver! - Will they be all right? - They have to be all right. - I don’t like it, we’re taking an awful chance, if something happens… - Okay, then you think of something better. Either we take chance or we’re through. Good end through.. broke! Joe, I got every cent in the world tied up in this place. It’d be the end of everything for me. I’ll only be able to keep the house. What makes you think I’m getting better off? I’ve got more than my money tied up in this. I got me tied up in it…me! My flesh and blood, my heart, my brains. 40 years of it, 40 hard years. Keller & Deever. I guess you don’t know what that means, because you… never had get it the way I did, what was all that to you? All you have to do was to reach up for it. Me, I had to grab it, grab it and hold on. When you were working for your father, Wearing a white caller and living in the best house in town… …I was collecting scrab iron from the back alleys, and junk pads. Old cars, old sinks, old stoves. I picked up a stove from you once, Do you know that? Paid you for two. I guess you wouldn’t remember. It was only for $3.50. But I would, because it was my last $3.50. I beat it from the scrab with my bare hands and I sold it for $5. $1.5 profit, nice turn-over. No, the tough times were finished when you joined up with me here. We were on the way then. Times when I couldn’t make the payroll. Yes, in the times of the workmen left on Saturday With more money in their pockets than I took home. In time when Kate took a job too, to pay the interest on the notes. Kate... Kate, the foreign girl who worked for you mother. You’re only losing money here, only money. This is a crime to ship those cylinders out of here. You must realize that. It’s only a crime if you get caught. The main thing is to servive. Joe Keller is going to servive! So, ship them outta here, I say they’re okay, Ship them! That’s the same, I didn’t ship them. On Monday Joe was home, sick, I was scared. I should like to say, I didn’t because of honesty and principal. But it isn’t so, I was merely frightened. And so Monday passed. Next day was Tuesday. That Tuesday.. It was mayhem The Equipment delivery was late. The army was quipte a scandal. When they left, I called up[ Joe. He was home, sick. The first time since I’ve know Joe, to stay home, sick. Joe, is that you? It’s Herb. They were just here, they want the stuff. - Well, did you tell tehm they’ll get them? - No, of course I didn’t tell them. Why didn’t you? Joe, I’m scared to take the responsibility. Who said you have to take the responsibility? Will you do like I say and stop acting like an old woman? - Joe, I’m frightened, can’t you come down here and handle it yourself? - How can I come down when I’m sick? - What if something happened? - Nothing is going to happen, I’ll take full responsibility.. full responsibility, you hear me? Yes, Joe, I know, you’ll take full responsibility, I heard you, but.. but just the same, Joe .. just the same! - Full responsibility I said. So, ship them, ship them I said. Joe... Joe ? What are we going to do about that material, Herb? They parting waiting for the loading plan, do they go or don’t they? Will somebody kindly make up their mind? Ship them, Eddie. - Ship them. - It’s about time. Ship them. “Full responsibility” he said. - He’ll take full responsibility. - But you told them this in the court, they didn’t believe you. The Judge, the Jury, all these men, they didn’t believe you, why? On the telephone you can’t have responsibility. In a court, you’ll gonna always deny it. He couldn’t be like that! He couldn’t be, I know him, he’s my father! This is something that you broaded about until it becomes real to you. But it isn’t the truth, you know it’s not the truth. It’s the truth, Chris. It’s the truth. Time’s up. Do the men in the plant still say: “If you wanna know, ask Joe?” All right. It’s all right Minnie, I’ll see who’s this. - Annie... - Yes, it’s me, may I come in? Of course. You surprised me. - I thought you were in Chicago? - I was, is Chris here? I found him at the office, They say he haven’t been there. He’s out of town for a few days in a vacation. Oh, it’s too bad, I wanted to talk to him before I spoke to you. - But..perhaps it’s just as well. - Annie... I don’t know what brought you back here, but I’m sorry you came. I’m not going to pretend to you. You’re not welcome here. I expected that you feel that way, Kate. But, it’s not important. - What’s important is what I have to say. - You have nothing to say to me. When I left you last week, it was for good. I thought I should never come back. In Chicago, I began to.. figure things out and I realized that I merely ran away, but I wouldn’t do. He isn’t bad to leave things the way they are, Kate. Sometimes, they got to be disturbed. What do you want of us? Why did you come back in our lives, you and George and your father? What do you want? - I want to marry Chris. - That’s impossible and you know it. Chris will never marry you as long as Larry is alive, he wouldn’t do such a thing. When will you learn to face the truth, Kate? The truth.. the truth, what good is the truth if it disturbs all, what good of it? - Chris asked me to marry him, Kate. - He had no right to do that and you had no right to let him. - It was wicked of you, both of you, and you know it. - We love each other. - You are engaged to Larry. - Larry is not coming back, Kate. No such thing, no such thing, you hear? He is coming back. And when he does, if you want to break it off, that’s all right, but you’ve got to wait till he comes back.. you’ve got to wait! We can’t wait forever, Chris and I have the right to live too. It doesn’t depend on me. I can’t change the way things are. I don’t wanna do it with out you consent, Kate. Would make Chris unhappy, he loves you so it will break his heart. You owe him this much happiness, Kate. Tell him it’s all right. It will take more than my words. The night you marry him, Larry would be with you. Your hearts will dry out with thinking of him, at every night after with as long as he lives. - Larry is dead. - No! - He crashed of the cost to China in February 9th, 1944. - You’ve got no proof. You say that but you have no proof. Not even the army had proof. I have proof, Kate. This is a letter from Larry. His last letter.. It’s written the day he died. No… - Read it, Kate. - No.. I didn’t want to show it to you. Larry... I know why it was.. I had to keep it from you. When Chris comes, I’ll be at Lydia’s. Larry... Annie... Annie. Joe must never see that letter. You hear? whatever happened! - Oh, That’s Joe. - Raise him. - What? - Oh well, in this far. - Too stiff for me. Fix me a drink, will you, Charlie? No, no, no! Joe doesn’t even need coaching, Charlie. He has a win us now. Right away, and that’s why. Right awaqy.. when I raise you. - Stay. - Don’t you ever lose, Joe? - Cards? - One please. He’s drawing you a flush again. Somebody can have see you See you on, Charilie. Did you fill it? Costs you money to find out. Good night, Joe Chris! When did you get back? I thought you want ot stay away for a while. - I just got in a stop to pick you. - Oh, that won’t be long, this is my last half. You know everybody here, don’t you? Oh, this is Mr. Ellsworth, big customer. - My son, Chris. - How are you, Chris? - Hey, let’s get this thing over, will we, huh?, it’s getting late. - Oh, where were we? I’ll call you, Joe. What’ve you got? - Four ladies. - Four! Didn’t think you have ‘em, Joe! See how it’s easy to make money, Chris? Collect, Charlie, get the money. Don’t pride, Joe, I’ll get you next Tuesday. You’ve gotta lose sometime, you know. You think this way, I’m going to give it back to you in poker. - See you next Tuesday. - Good night. What cards? the man has no luck. - In the morning, Joe, Chris. - Good night, Sweede. Good game, Joe. It was fun. - Fight me again. - I certainly will, I need to take your money. - I told you to play that hand, Joe. - You certainly did, Charile, you certainly did. - Good night, Joe. - Good night. - You play poker as well as your father? - I can do anything as well as my father. You hear that? and he’ve got an education too, me? I never went to school. “Ignoramus”, he calls me. By the way, Joe, we’re getting complains from the Retail as things to be something the matter with the doors, got any ideas? Oh, that’s stamping machine. We had a bad stamping machine. You ship them back and I’ll replace Them, no cost for you. And here’s something else you don’t know. and non of your experts know either, - They’re not exactly the specifications. - They’re not? - Yeah, I changed them myself. - If I follow those high pro blueprints of you’re here, we’re gonna broke. - Joe, you’re a wonder. - I bet there’s no name or a place you don’t know about. - Oh, I wouldn’t bet against that. If you wanna know, ask Joe. Isn’t that what they say in the trade? - That’s right, if you wanna know, ask Joe. - Well, good night, Joe, see you. - Good night - Glad I met you. - Good night, sir. - Better luck next time. That’s big man. Head of “United Services”. We’re making plenty with him. You wanna know, ask Joe. What do you know about that? Even he heard it. I’m getting famous. Put the chairs back, will you? What’s the matter? you don’t look happy. Didn’t you have a good time? This is really true dad: “if you wanna know, ask Joe”? Sure, every nail in the joint, just like you said. That’s how I put this place up, by knowing what’s going on, know it’s good. - But I wanna ask you a straight question. - Then shoot, go ahead. How did those cylinders shipped outta here without you knowing about them? - So, you’re around that again, huh? - Well, how did they? Why don’t you go ahead and say I’m guilty? Go ahead, you might as well. I don’t want you to be guilty, I want you to be innocent, but people have put doubts in my mind, help me to get rid of ‘em. Isn’t that enough that I have told you so? Can’t you trust your old father? You’re right, I should, I really should. But somehow I can’t, I can’t let it get out of that, you’ve got to help me. What can I do? I told you a million times. I told the Jury, - What can I do? - Dad, I saw Herb Deever today. I went to Springfield and saw him. - Why would you go ahead and do a thing like that for? - He told me his side of the story and I wanna hear yours. - My own son.. - I wanna hear yours and judge for myself. My son is spying on me. Going behind my back. Dad, I’ve got to know what happened. You owe it to me to explain, you hear? You owe it to me to expain. Expain! Expain! that’s all I’ve been doing.. the explaining! I’m tired of explaining. Sick and tired of it, I don’t have to explain, not to you. You’re my son, you’re in it with me. My flesh and blood. You wear my clothes, eat my food. You live in my home, I don’t have to explain to you. If I’m guilty, then you’re guilty too. You understand me? You’re guilty too! Then.. you did know. Man is in business. I’m in business. A patch of bad cylinders and you’re out of business, out of business! You don’t know how operate they’ll kill you. They’ll close up your plant, tear up your contracts, your stuff is no good. What’s it to them? You got 40 years into business and they… cut your head off in five minutes. And what can I do? Let them take 40 years away? Let them take my life away? I.. I never thought they’ll install them. Honest I didn’t. I thought they’ll be stopped somewhere Along the line. Why didn’t you tell them? you knew they were defective, you knew they wouldn’t hold off , you knew it! It was too late. The newspapers, it was all over the front page. 21 planes crashed.. It was too late, they came away with handcuffs to the factory. What could I do? I ask you, what could I do? Chris.. Chris, I did it for you. I’m an old man, when would I have another chance to make something for you? For me? For me? I was dying every day and my boys were dying and you did it for me! what kind of a man are you anyway? Kids hanging in the air by those cylinders and you knew it! I was so proud of you, you were helping us to win. and you were worried about your business. Don’t you have a country? Don’t you think about People? Don’t you live in the world? Haven’t you got a heart? - What can I do with you? - Chris!.. Chris! Dad… dad! Chris... Chris... Why don’t you go to bed, Kate? It’s almost 01:00 O’clock. You know why, I’m waiting for Chris. Don’t worry about me, Jim. I’m perfectly all right. Would you like some coffee? It’s too late for Coffee. It’s too late for you too, why don’t you go to sleep? I don’t want to go to sleep tonight. - Had an emergency? - Somebody had a belly ache, he thought he was dying. How’s Joe? Cried like a child. I never saw him that way. Since when did you know it, Jim? Since always I guess, Kate. You’re smart. I always had the feeling in… in the back of his head, Chris knew. I didn’t think it will be such a shock. You don’t know your own son. You don’t think he’d… Go away without… - I mean, for good. - He’ll be back. Chris is a good son, he’ll come back. I… heard voices. - Hello, Doc. - Hi, Joe. - What are you doing here? - I was just going. Put it to bed, Joe. Both of you go to bed. Staying up won’t help. Sleep well. Sleep is so wonderful thing. Best thing about living. What did he want? - I don’t like him mixing up too much. - Joe, he knows. - How does he know? - Guessed it a long time ago. I don’t like that.s I guess Annie knows too. - You heard from her? - No, she’s still away at Lydia’s Weird thing she’s not coming back here. - May be Chris is with her. - No, Frank was just here. What is this? Open house in the middle of the night? - Would you like a cup? - Oh, you know what it does to me. I thought I had a family. What happened to my family, Kate? - Joe, I was thinking this way, if he comes back… - He is coming back, what do you mean “if”? I think… if you could SIT him down and explain yourself, I mean… You ought to make it clear to him that… You know you didn’t have a thing. I mean… If he saw that you realized what you did.. you… You see? - Ask him to forgive me, you mean? - Something like that, Joe. Ask my son to forgive me. I don’t know what happened. He wanted money, so I made money. Man has to take care of his family, that’s the first thing he has to do, he has to take care of his family, what must I be forgiven? You needed money, didn’t you do? Buy clothes, food and some for children school.. You ought to have money, didn’t you? - Joe, not that way. - I didn’t want it that way either. What difference it is as long as you’ve got it? I spoiled the both of you, I should’ve put him out when he was 10 like I was put out. To know how a buck is made In this world. Forgive me! I could live on a buck a day, myself. but I’ve got a family, so I… - You get dozen execuses though that you did it for the family, Joe. - He’s got to excuse it. - There’s something bigger than the family to him, Joe.. - No, no, there’s nothing bigger than that. There’s nothing he can do that I couldn’t forgive. Because I’m his father and he’s my son, there’s nothing bigger than that. And you’re going to tell him that, you understand? - You don’t.. you don’t think he’d go to the police? - Joe, please! No. No, he wouldn’t do a thing like that. Not without telling me. Where is he? Going away like this. and.. not saying a word? not coming back? He’ll be alright, Joe. Nothing is going to happen. For you, Kate, for both of you. That’s all I’ll ever live for. I know, Joe. I know. I know. - Annie. - Chris. Chris, dear, I knew you’d be here. He’s guilty, Ann. Jim Bayliss told me what happened. Sitting out here looking at the stars. Trying to figure it out. Looking and looking and trying to figure it out. - I almost killed ‘em, Ann. - Chris, no! I loved him, Annie, I loved him and I almost killed ‘em, I still don’t know how I didn’t. It would have been useless. Becaue he doesn’t know what he did. He doesn’t know how awful a thing it was. He lied to himself and he doesn’t know. He’ll has to suffer to know. He’ll has to suffer some horrible way to know. Come away with me, Chris, leave them all and come away wiith me, we’ll forget everything and start fresh. No I can’t run away. It’s too easy to run away. We’ve all been running away for it’s too easy. What can you do? Would give him up. Go to the police and give him up. It’s not enough to give him up, Annie. It’s not enough to put him in jail. He’s got to see it himself, he’s got to understand what he did, do you see what I mean, Annie? He’s got to see it and be his own judge. Yes, Chris. But how’d you make a man see it to himself? How do you explain such a thing to a man like that? A man who’s forgotten about all other men. Living as if he is alone in the world. How do you tell him such a thing and make him understand? You show him this. So, you’ve decided to come back, huh? What do you mean by frightening your mother half to death that way? What kind of a thing is that to do? - You know she’s not well. - I wanna talk to you, dad. And I wanna talk to you. Something bothers you, huh? - I’ve got too much money, is that what bothers you? - The way you’ve got it bothers me. Well then, what’s the problem? When something bothers you that you can’t use to it, then get rid of it. If you can’t use to it then throw it away, you hear me? Pick every cent and give it to.. charity. Throw it in the sewer! That settle it? In the sewer, that’s all. That’s not enough, dad. What’s the matter? You think I’m kidding? I’m telling you what to do, if it’s dirty then.. burn it. It’s your money not mine. I’m a dead man, I’m an old dead man, nothing is mine. - So, tell me, what do you want me to do? - It’s not what I want you to do, it’s what you want to do. What should I want to do? Prison? You want me to go to prison? Is that where I belong? Well then, tell me so. What’s the matter? Why can’t you tell me? You say everything else to me, say tat! I will tell you why you can’t say it. Because you know I don’t belong there! You know! Read this, dad. Then tell yourself what you must do. - What is it? What you’ve got there? - Crhis.. Chris, where have you been? No, Chris, no! - It’s from Larry.. - Give it to me. - Larry? - He wrote it the day he died. Don’t read it, Joe. - “My dear Ann..” - No, Chris, you go away. Now, be quiet, Kate. I wanna hear what he has to say “It’s impossible to put down the things I feel, but I’ve got to tell you something.” “Yesterday, they’ve flown a lot of papers from the states, and I read about dad and your father.” “I’m not clever the way you are, The way Chris is.” “And I can not understand or make myself understand, how this could have happened?” “We’ve got to be proud with the plaqnes we fly.” “They come to be piece by piece, bit by bit, something ever you at home would have made them.” “We’re not alone, but my father has made me alone.” “He has betrayed us all.” “You at home has kept faith us, We’ve kept taith with you.” “I’m ashamed, I can’t face the other men.” “I can’t face anybody.” “I don’t know how to tell you, Annie. But I’m going out on a mission in a few minutes.” “And I will not come back.” “I want you to forgive me, Annie for doing this. But this is the only way I know how to pay for what he’s done.” You understand what this means dad? Yeah. I understand. I didn’t like doing this dad, you know? Sure, Kid, I know. You did right. Joe. Oh, it’s no use, Kate. No use. Maybe I’ve known it all along. A man… can be defective too. Like a machine part, a cylinder. Little pressure and he cracks. Lot of innocent people die. A lot of innocent people. You’ve paid for it, Joe. Larry paid for it, he was your son. There’s nothing more you can do. Sure, he was my son. But I think of him. They were all my sons. I guess they were. All.. my sons. He’s your father, you can’t send your own father to prison. - It’s with him now, mom, it’s whatever he thinks. - Have you gone crazy? What’s accomplished if goes to jail? Will it raise the dead? - Alas, it’s over.. It’s over! - Don’t say that mom. What was Larry to you? a stone that fell into the water? It’s not enough to be sorry. Larry didn’t kill himself, so you and dad could be sorry. - He did it to show you. - What more can we be than sorry? What more? You can be better. Once and for all you can know that he whole universe outside and you’re responsible to it. And if you’re not then you’ve threw your son away. Because that’s why he died, you understand? That’s why. Joe ! - Don’t go in, mom! - Why not? I took care of him all his life. Whenever he needed me. I can take care of him now too. Make it good life for yourselves. and never look back. Never. Larry is dead, and Joe is dead. So, live. Live.
