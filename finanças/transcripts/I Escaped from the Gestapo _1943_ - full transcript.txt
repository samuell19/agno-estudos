[orchestral music] [music continues] [alarm wailing] [alarm wailing] [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [dramatic music] - Can you make it, Eric? - Yeah. It's not far, the empty house. [music continues] Eric, Eric. Eric. (male #1) 'Come on, Lane.' [crickets chirping] If you get him to a doctor, he may have a chance. Get rid of him. [thud] Hey, what is this? It's too bad, but his job is done. - What kind of coppers are you? - We're not. [engine revving] Get into these, they'll fit you. Your measurements have been on display in every post office in the country. Don't remind me of it. Here. Well, my appreciation for your... impeccable taste. Save it. Here's something else for you to wear. It's the right size. What's that for? You gonna meet somebody. Eric said they were no strings attached to this break. This is no string. Okay, I'm in. [crickets chirping] Alright, men. [dramatic music] [music continues] - Here he is, safe and sound. - Good. I'll go and change. We're delighted to have you with us. I still haven't a glimmer as to who "us" is? 'All I could get out of the sphinx' 'was I was gonna see a man. If he'd said a woman, I..' I see you have a sense of humor. I like a sense of humor. If there's anything you care for... a drink perhaps? No, no, thanks. Steady nerves are my stock and trade. - I wouldn't mind a cigar. - Cigar? Sorry. A neighbor dropped in. Rare Havana. Cigars are my only vice. Mm. That's a fine engraving job. That's quite a compliment coming from you. Do you know what this is? Oh, yes, I can read it. Thousand dollar interest bearing gold bond. Why? - Can you make 'em? - With my eyes closed. Bad imitation of a thousand franc note. You'll have to hand out dark glasses to pass these. I think it'll be simpler to have better reproductions. [clears throat] That's why we got the best engraver in or outside of captivity over here. Oh, yes? That's all. I assure you, we're going to get along very well. Very well. - That depends. - On what? What do I get? Thirty percent of all we pass. Thirty five percent. It's a deal. I see you also have a sense for business. You haven't done so badly yourself. [telephone ringing] - Yes, sir? - Lokin? We'll be ready to roll in a few minutes. For now, goodbye and good luck. You mean we're off again? I was just beginning to like this place. This place must be forgotten.. '...completely.' Why don't you pick on someone your size? Uh, Bergen. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] [music continues] - Hi, neighbor. - You talk too much. Come on. [engine revving] 'Well, Gerard. Was it worth the effort?' Very much so, I think. Very much so. [dramatic music] [thud] [train whistle blowing] [music continues] Gave them everything, Chief. Checked the railroad track where we picked him up. And it looks as if Torgen Lane finished his sentence faster outside than inside. Perhaps. Fingerprints checked? No, I should've said we shoveled him up. Not enough fingerprints to make a blot. Find any connection with Eric Manding? Just a hunch, that when Manding blasted into that post office like an amateur and then practically ran into the patrol wagon. He wanted to get into that prison to get to Lane. He did. You can give the news to the press now. (man on radio) 'And now from Washington, the nations capital' 'comes news that gasoline and oil conservation' 'will soon be the order of the day.' Let's get some music. 'The body of Torgen Lane, escaped convict' 'was found badly mangled, yesterday morning' 'on the tracks of the Missouri Western railroad.' 'It is evident that Lane was cut down by the Missouri flyer.' 'Lane, the former notorious counterfeiter, who... ' [radio turned off] - It's me their talking about. - That was you. - Well, who's the guy that... - Nobody you knew. But I.. What do you fellas use for a heart? [scoffs] I remember... brains. Gerard may like a sense of humor. I don't. [instrumental music] [upbeat music] [indistinct chattering] Hot dogs, huh? Sea air. Dirty kids. Taking a walk without bumping into a wall. [music continues] To think that I once knocked out half a million dollars of queer money in a Park Avenue penthouse. That's the first time I was rich. You won't be this time. Hello, pal. I know exactly how you feel. Come on, Lane. Well, what kind of a place is this? Still curious, huh? No, it's not me, it's the cat. That's what killed the cat, bud. - So, you've arrived? - There he is, Martin. You're Torgen Lane? That's right. My mascot. You both seemed to have had a very trying trip. Oh, nothing that a saucer of milk, a shower and a little shut-eye won't cure. No, it was more like a vacation for me. We'll take care of all that. Then your vacation will be over. My work is my hobby, Mr. Martin. Mm. One armed bandits, huh? I see you fellas even grabbed the nickels. They count up. Now, let me show you your workroom. Ah, what junkyard did you raid to get this stuff? Well, give me the head of a pen and a piece of paper I'll turn out enough queer money for you to balance the budget. - I hope. - Pleasant thought. You'll find some extra clothes in here. A shower. And you have a very comfortable bed. You mean, I'm gonna live in here? No, sir. At least at the pen I had a view it wasn't much, but it was a view. - Who do you think you are? - Now, just a minute, Bergen. I think I understand his feelings. You realize of course, that this is a hideout. Hideout or not a man's got to breathe. Well, your quarters are air conditioned. Just relax and after a while we'll go over your work. You're gonna be a very busy man. [sighs] Well, you're a strange baby. Wha-what you're for? Talking to myself. Think I was still in the jug. Sorry, pal, I forgot you were here. You're thin, pal, we'll have to fatten you up. No doorknob. And cold rolled steel.. Me locked behind it. A hideout.. So is a coffin. Nine, ten. Three paces larger than my last hotel. But no genuine partner. What kinda deal is this anyway? [gunshots] [clatters] You shouldn't have tried that, Lane. Evidently not. What was all that shooting about? I thought the... cops were coming in here. Shooting? Oh, come along. [gunshots continue] [gunshots] So, that's it. Say, how about squandering some of this out there? As long as you're with me, you'll be my guest a discreet one I hope. Don't worry about that. My days of indiscretion are over. I don't like the way he's treating him with kid gloves. - The gloves will come off. - Hmm. [indistinct chattering] [slot machines clinking] Well, is this where I change guides? No, just quarters. There you are. Your girl will love it. 'Gee, you made me look rugged.' Well, aren't you? 'If you'll return in 20 minutes, your recording will be ready.' 20 minutes? Gee, I've got lot to do. Well, okay, sister. Have a talking picture made, send it home. Not a bad idea. Step right into that booth, please. How about you sitting with me? The last time I had my picture taken by myself it brought me bad luck. - I'm sorry. - And I'm heartbroken. Well, Mr. Martin I'm having some difficulty with a few customers. They're complaining about waiting so long for the record. - I don't see why... - It's not your job to see. Record is checked for accuracy. We pride ourselves on that. - Well, I don't see why I... - Those are my final orders. Oh, you still here? - Mr. Martin, this man is... - Is annoying me. - Well, customer or no... - He's not a customer. He's learning the arcade business. Have a talking picture made. Ah, just, uh, between us, is she in this setup? Your job with us is confined to engraving. - Hello, Mr. Martin. - Two root beers. [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] [music continues] You're very deft. Cigar? (Lane) 'No charge.' Of all the nerve! (Lane) 'Rare museum piece.' (kid #1) 'Read all about the great victory. Read all about it..' Hey, kid, paper. That's the kind of news I like to hear. It's pretty good, isn't it? - Paper, Mr. Martin? - Sure, this is on me. Thanks. Read all about the great victory. Read all about it. The paper hanger is getting pasted right in the puss. Have a talking picture made? Sure. Why do you think I'm here? You can go right in there and have your record made first. I ain't no Crawford Hugh, but my ma thinks I'm a nightingale. Don't bust that record. Soon as possible, I want to replace the girl. She questions my orders and I do not like that. Yes, sir. Well, thanks for answering my earlier question. Does she or does she not belong to this setup, I mean. - She does not, I presume. - You're astute. But you have more serious work ahead of you. Your first test will be the gold bonds. As soon as you finish the plate I'll tell you the number to run. Well, just a thought before I start, Mr. Martin. I got to acclimatize myself to these surroundings nicely. And I have no quarrel with the feminine selection. Well, I can't work behind locked doors in fact, I can't work at all. I'm afraid, you'll have to, you've no alternative. - Now, go to your room. - Don't play Superman. I'm just giving it to you straight. Prison walls suffocate me and all my talents. I have given you your orders. Who made you Chief Killer-Diller? I guess they did. Well, majority rules with me. As soon as the bonds are completed I'll assign him to making the foreign money. He'd better rush those bonds. Listen to this. (Lokin) '"...their new type synthetic high octane gas."' 'If that happens, we don't stand a chance in grabbing the plant.' That is Gerard's concern, not yours. They're almost here. They'll contact us at three. (Martin) 'At 2:45 you'll take your positions. Everything's set.' [thud] (man on record) 'Hello, ma. Recognize me? I mean my voice.' 'It's Timmy, how are you?' 'Funny it took a war to make me a recording star.' 'I wished I could see you before I go out again' 'but it doesn't look that way.' 'We're sailing Thursday on the good old Sargosa.' 'When you'll be hearing this, I'll be on my way to Australia.' 'Maybe If I'm lucky I'll pick up' 'a couple of zeros on the way and knock them down good.' 'I'm on the guns crew. Hugs and kisses to you and the family.' Bergen. Listen to that record and take care of it immediately. (man on record) 'Hello, ma. Recognize me? I mean my voice.' 'It's Timmy, how are you?' 'Funny it took a war to make me a recording star.' 'I wished I could see you before I go out again' 'but it doesn't look that way.' 'We're sailing Thursday on the good old Sargosa.' 'When you'll be hearing this, I'll be on my way to Australia.' 'Maybe, if I'm lucky..' (Lane) 'Ah, my keeper.' I'd, uh, rather see a headwaiter or am I on bread and water too? And what about pal? Lane, I owe you an explanation. Our organization is a large one. Whenever a new man comes in we naturally take every precaution to be certain of him. Now, that's understandable up to a point but it's not quiet sharp enough. I want the whole score and I want it now. When you finish your job here what about South America? How would you like that? Brother, don't tempt me. Now, I'd like to see these tools in action. I know you have quiet a reputation to live up to. Yes... haven't I? And by the way, here's a small rush job. Would you duplicate this and insert the name of the steam ship, Sargosa? Sargosa? A boat pass. What's this for? It's a method we have of shipping the money. Now, is there.. Is there anything else you'd like to know? That's something you can answer more easily than I, Mr. Martin. I'm glad you... understand things so readily. More going on around here than a.. Three o'clock. What three o'clock? Sargosa, boat pass oil refinery, all mixed up with something. Pal, for a fellow that's supposed to be in on the know.. Instead of feeding him I'd like to know when that Sargosa pass will be ready. There isn't much time to get the stuff aboard. I'll check on it. Pretty good for a jailbird. Come on. Ah, you're at work. That's good. Oh, I see you've finally brought me some food. Well, that's good too. Here, put it up here. Boy, you sure forgot to duck. (Lane) 'Only a .45 could slug a hole like that.' That's an honorable wound. - Lokin, you may go now. - Yes, sir. Well, you better see a doctor. Those are old wounds that haven't healed with bad medicine. Now, don't smudge that. It isn't dry. My compliments. Excellent piece of work. You didn't need an expert for that. [door closes] Honorable wound, huh? Sargosa, boat pass. Oil refinery. Well, I take the blue ribbon. [dramatic music] [music continues] [tools clattering] Martin, it's 2:40. Let's go. Goodbye, pal. [dramatic music] [music continues] [banging] [creaking] I heard something. Nerves? [instrumental music] [waves swooshing] [banging] [intense music] [music continues] [waves swooshing] [dramatic music] [thud] [sighs] Don't do that, pal. [music continues] [papers rustling] Oil refinery, huh? [instrumental music] [hissing] [intense music] [rattles] [music continues] This will hang 'em. Private Fred Boat in 361 battalion. [murmuring] We were fishing and our dory sank. How did it happen to sink? We capsized. Greetings and my compliments. [dramatic music] Eric, has he been transferred from this district? We're very proud of Eric. Seaman first class, USS Martin. USS Martin. That boat pass. Operator? (Lane) 'Operator.' [clicking] Operator. This is.. [thud] Hello. Hello? What number did I call? I'm sorry, never mind. I should have shot him. It wouldn't be easy to explain a shot heard over the telephone. - Take him away. - Alright, you boys. In here. How do you manage to get such wonderful coffee? It's like when we first took over the warehouses in Denmark. They still have it here. Take away their morning cup of coffee it's worse to these Americans than sinking a battleship. Good ham. When we were in West Fairlee, Eric could eat a whole ham without getting a stomach ache. That was a long time ago. [speaking in foreign language] Soon it'll be we Germans that shall eat and the rest of the world shall starve. Oh, these are comrades. Were you successful? It was easy with the pass. Only trouble I had was finding enough stuff to fill the bag after I'd taken out the explosives. That's how well we work here. And to be doubly certain, Bergen shortwaved the information to the commandant of your undersea craft. So we were informed. Ah, the Sargosa. May she soon be on the bottom. [groans] You're a fortunate young man for one so foolhardy. If we didn't need you, you're last breath would've been at that telephone. Well, I presume you've learned your lesson. It will be sad to remove artistic young engravers as yourself from active service. Hart here was an authority on work such as yours adds his compliments to mine. - Have you finished? - Perhaps. Well, then listen. I'm not doing your dirty work. Don't forget I know what's going on around here. I know why you're running that arcade. I know that you steam-open letters written by kids to their families to get information. I know you use that recording machine for the same thing. And I know a couple of other things too. They all add up to the same. You're a bunch of rotten spies and saboteurs. Are you playing the fool or trying to play a storybook hero? No, I once read about a lad by the name Benedict Arnold as for the hero stuff, you can count me out. Right now I'm scared stiff. - You're cracked. - And so is the Liberty Bell. But it'll still be here after you rats are dead and buried. Get to that bench. And the answer is no. I'm asking you again, will you get to that bench? And the answer is still no. Perhaps you can persuade him. [intense music] [thwacking] [thwacking continues] Mr. Moen, brutality disturbs me. Turn on the radio. [thwacking] [music on radio] (man on radio) 'We interrupt this program for a Navy Department 'communique just received.' 'The SS Sargosa, merchant ship has been sunk.' 'Casualties are unknown at this moment.' 'The Navy department also announces' 'the sinking by air action of a Japanese submarine' 'near the vicinity of the disaster.' 'We now resume our program of "Breakfast Music."' [music continues] Well, continue. [thwacking continues] Special delivery. That's enough. He's a very strong willed man. Cut him down. Perhaps you'd like to hear a part of this letter. "Following your orders, I immediately went "to the farm of Anna Lane, Torgen Lane's mother "in Willow Creek. "I became a paying guest. The first one she's ever had. "I will not let her out of my sight. I await your further instructions." You're lying. And I thought those atrocity stories was a bunk. I seem to remember an old Anglo-Saxon proverb to the effect that, "All's fair in love and war." The only difference is, we practice it. 'Well, you've made up your mind?' To be perfectly bold about it, we hold your mother hostage for your good behavior. You win. But remember that a beating couldn't do it. In my philosophy, the means are of no importance it's only the results that count. You'll have the freedom of the place, but never alone. I'll assign Gordon here to be with you constantly. Any overt move will jeopardize your mother long before any act on your part can help you or her. You'll start on the gold bonds immediately there's no time to be lost. - I'd like to keep this. - Do. Look at her frequently. And I thought I was breaking to freedom. 'And the sap who broke me out got his freedom alright.' 'Right in the garbage, that's where they dumped him.' Only decent thing I ever did was a while back when I wandered into a boomed meeting by mistake. That was one boomed meeting, it didn't last very long. Now, I'm doing this instead of shooting guys like you. Shut up or I'll kill you. Just take it easy, butcher. Remember, I'm an honored guest here. And speaking of butchers, how many, uh, kids did you kill 'to get that Iron Cross you told me about?' You think I'm a fool, don't you? Well, yes, I do. When a kid like you goes factious it means somebody sold you a bill of goods because all you're doing is the dirty work for the big shots. I read somewhere that Goring... a fat baboon is the richest man in Germany. And what have you got? Blood on your hands, that's all. I'll not talk with you. It's alright with me, I'm used to talking to myself. Though I've never seen you laugh or smile, you know that? Until victory, I cannot laugh. Even if you did win, which you won't, what would it do for you? Take those ghosts outta your head? No. Stop it! Well, that, uh, that little ocean jump didn't help your nerves any, did it? Now, we both could use some fresh air. Say, you haven't seen the arcade as yet, have you? You know I've had no moment from you I'm as much as a prisoner here in this room as you are. Come on. I'll show you a bit of America. Say, did you know a boy named, Eric? He looked something like you. He was my brother. Your brother? Right in the garbage, that's where they buried him. [knocking] [keys jingling] Where you going? Just stretching our legs. Me and my ball and chain. - Watch him closely. - I know that. Now, boys, don't fight over me. [upbeat music] [indistinct chattering] [laughing] Bet you never heard laughter like that? You see what I mean? That's America. [chattering continues] - Hello. - Hello. Thanks for your Rembrandt. Just to show you that you haven't the corner on art. Please. Oh, don't mind him. He's learning to be my shadow. Shadow? Another of the perambulating mechanics around here, huh? Yes, mechanic. Here. (female #1) 'It's for memory.' Not bad. (Lane) 'Not bad.' Just a sample of what we raise here. Nice? (Lane) 'She reads too.' We don't burn books here, do we, Helen? Naturally not. This isn't Germany. Perhaps we should send one to your mother. You haven't forgotten her, have you? How could anyone forget a mother? What would your mother want with "Fundamentals of Welding?" Welding? Don't tell me you're learning how to swing a hot rod? I thought all welders chewed tobacco. If chewing tobacco would get ships built faster, I'd do it. [clinks] Oh! [music continues] You're wanted. Huh. You're a little late with that news. That's for him. He's a little bashful when company's around. 'This is for your scrapbook when nobody's around.' I'm afraid my scrapbook is too small. The size of your head, you know. What's that? A very bad picture of a very good guy. Try putting it together. It might teach you how to improve your art. I just checked the refinery. And your analysis is correct. Not only do we obtain the formula for our own use by controlling the plant, but we also control the production of high-octane. It's a marvelous picture. All those empty fuel tanks waiting the new miracle fuel. And so much difficulty producing it. This will give their War Production Board a headache. I will be your ally. These will bring it to our side. Ah, Lane, Hart here tells me your plate of the gold bond is excellent. You can start running them now. Incidentally, I've news of your mother. She feels splendid. [laughing] What these Americans think of their money. I love message written on it. "Darling, flowers fade, this won't. Frame it until we get together. Billy." [laughing continues] Yes, that is really a message. Come on, watchdog. I beg to be relieved of this duty, Herr Kapitan. - I can't stand it any longer. - Still teasing you, eh? Disregard. Empty words. But I did not come here for such duties. You're insubordinate. [thwacks] [dramatic music] Ja, Herr Kapitan. [music continues] Fine, kid. Here we are, two guys in a room. Both a couple of rats. I bet if we had to do it again, we'd play a different tune. Perhaps you. Not me. Don't kid me, butcher. Please don't call me butcher. Well, that's up to you. I'll stop when you've lost that look in your eyes. No, you did today, for just a moment, when you saw Helen. I'd have bet my shirts, you couldn't look that human. I'd have lost, wouldn't I? - 'Like her, don't you?' - Well, I.. - I have no interest in her. - You're lying. - And you know it. - 'What do you mean?' You're getting tired of being played for a sap by a little mustached mug that thinks he's a God, aren't you? 'You're beginning to wonder if your brain's been twisted' with all the rot you've learned? You wanna laugh, don't you, kid? You wanna be able to see that gal out there without being afraid, don't you? Please.. Don't. Okay, kid, I guess we better turn in. (Lane) You wanna laugh. You wanna go out with that girl. Like her, don't you? You're brain's twisted. Blood on your hands. [indistinct chattering] What's the matter with you moping around here on your day off? The water's wonderful. Just studying. Dreaming, I'd say. You don't even know his name. Oh, that isn't the only mystery about it. - Are you going in? - To get dressed. - It's getting late. - I'll meet you after dinner. Can't tonight. Still have to study up on my electrodes. - So romantic. - Excuse me. Fine. Here's your next job. Make all of these you can run off. Money from neutral countries, huh? Fight them with phony money. Buy quislings. Bring about a false inflation. Make it simple for your fascist friends to move right in. You fellas fight a war with no holds barred. There's only one way to win a war. Just wait until the chips are in before you count up. Why don't you shut up? Let him make his little speeches as long as he does our work. Bergen's an animal. It's close in here. - The arcade? - If you want. You get our coats and I'll straighten up here. [instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] Oh, it's her day off. Should we go back? You know.. Helen's like the girls in Germany used to be long ago. It was like that kind of a wind that comes in from the ocean. - It was good. - A poet. [chuckles] Yes, and a musician. My mother used to raise flowers to pay for my lessons. Well, someday I'll play again. After the war is won. Maybe. If we win it. [music continues] [chattering continues] Mendelssohn. I haven't heard Mendelssohn since the Reichstag fire. Oh, it's forbidden. Not here. Nothing's forbidden here. Chalk one up for us. [instrumental music] It's beautiful. Look what Mendelssohn brought out? [music continues] So you wouldn't let a day pass without seeing me. Your conceit is gonna explode someday, right in your mirror. No, I just dropped in to tell Martin I'm leaving. - Leaving? - For Seattle. My cousin just arranged a job for me in her department at a shipyard. Men are having a tough job keeping up with the women today. We used to hold you with a weekly paycheck. What do we do now? Well, maybe we won't have to marry a male just for security. Good old love will come back into the picture. Well, that calls for a strong drink. - Well.. - Three soda pops. Squeeze a little lime in one. How's that fair? Breaking up a happy triangle. A bad mathematician. Seattle is a wonderful town. You'd, uh, you'd like it, Gordon. Tell me, do you, uh, like Mendelssohn? I love it. If you waltz to Mendelssohn, you have a date tonight. I waltz to Mendelssohn. There you are, Gordon. You have a date tonight. Alright, John Alden. Next time, you can speak for yourself. Oh, but I don't... There's Mr. Martin. I must see him. It's a date on one condition. That you leave your shadow at home. Bye. [violin music] [piano music] [peppy music] A note and now this. Something's got to work. If life plays true to form, we'll hamstring those rats. Sure hated to make that sacrifice play though. That Helen... is quite a gal, pal. Am I cupid or not? Well... I don't know what to say. Except that... for the first time in ten years I've forgot about the New Order. And... about these hands. Well, stain goes deeper than that, kid. What are you gonna do about it? What can I do? Martin's given me my orders. I have to meet Bergen and I.. - Then we'd.. - Then what? Blow up a plant and get yourself another Iron Cross. Listen, kid. Get out of here. Go up to Seattle. You have papers. So they're forged. Get yourself a job. You could sleep at night. You wouldn't look at those hands as if you hated them. I did as you said. I told Martin I wanted to wander through a typical American town to better understand the people. [sighs] Gee, wherever you go, they smile. You are right. Tough smile. - Won't be easy to defeat you. - Forget about that. Think about yourself, kid. Think about that lovely gal, Helen. She likes you. All she did was to ask questions about you. Why, sure. That was to make you jealous. I know women. Now, look. I'll heel you with plenty of dough. You know the kind that crinkles. It'll buy you your freedom. All that holds me in here are four walls. You're tied up with something that's a darned sight tougher to break out off. I'm giving you the key. Why are you doing all this for me? Because I don't want to see you wind up in the garbage. Oh.. What about Bergen? I-I have to meet him. I-I.. It's Bergen... or it's Helen? You won't have to burn down a city to get her. Take your pick. [taps] Get some sleep. Well.. How will I find her in Seattle? You'll find her, alright. You were born under a lucky star. [slow-paced music] [music continues] Hundreds of little messengers. Straight to the secret service. Boy! When the infrared hits you, will they be surprised. I hope. And will they be surprised. [music continues] [dramatic music] [train chugging] There you are, sir. Seattle, one-way. [dramatic music] [music continues] [train chugging] Being torpedoed wasn't so bad. You expect that. But when that submarine came up and started throwing shells into our life boat like we were pigeons, that's something else. That ain't war. That's plain murder. 'One of these days I'll run into one of those Nazis. I know.' 'I'd give my other arm right now to meet them.' 'Butchers, that's what they are.' [dramatic music] [slow-paced music] [music continues] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [glass shattering] [explosions] [music continues] [woman screaming] (Lane) Butcher, butcher, butcher, butcher, butcher, butcher. Butcher, butcher, butcher. You're a butcher. You're a butcher. You're a butcher. [Gordon screams] [train chugging] [dramatic music] [music intensifies] [dramatic music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [telephone ringing] Yes. Will you please mail it here, Western Utilities. Utilities building, San Francisco, thank you. There, the most important part has been accomplished. But where is Gordon? His absence is most inefficient. [buzzing] (woman on intercom) 'Mr. Domack, would you please send... ' I'm not to be disturbed. Gordon should be here. It's that Martin. He belongs on the Russian Front, not here. He might have given him another assignment. Oh, that cant be. Gordon and Lunt were sent for this job. Lunt was to hold back production and Gordon was to breakdown the formula and send it to Germany. Why, he spent seven months in the Dusseldorf refinery just for that. If he's not here tomorrow morning you return to the arcade and.. Why not this moment? Why delay? You never can tell. It may be the FBI that's kept Gordon from getting here. By tomorrow we might know something. Ridiculous, the newspapers would have have it. - I tell you, it's that Martin. - 'I don't agree.' I'm certain, but I'm not worried about the FBI. Not worried at all. Honest, I never seen this pigeon. Try again, that plane trip across the country might have made your brain weary. I ain't got no mental rupture, I tell you. Torgen Lane sounds like a street to me and nothing else. I know this is Torgen Lane's work. Perhaps he's cutting us long distance knowing we can't get to him. And I don't believe in ghosts. Use the infrared on this paper. This isn't American stock valve. This paper is the same material used in the German Reichsmark. Maybe when racketeers die, they go to Germany. The infrared washed out everything, but that. 'Cover every Joyland Arcade and Willow Creek in the country.' Call Bolling Field airport, we're leaving for the coast. There we go where the money was passed, it'll lead to Lane. [airplane droning] We've netted every Joyland Arcade and every Willow Creek. But what are we looking for? We'll know when we find it. [telephone ringing] Rodt speaking. Good work. Anna Lane, Torgen Lane's mother lives at Willow Creek, California. Contact Oakland. Yes, sir. It's 7:15. I should be there by noon. Your nerves are not so good, Mr. Lane. This isn't exactly a rescue. Wait till you get a dose of it. That will never be. - What are you doing here? - Why didn't Gordon leave? Everything's all ready for us over at the refinery. He did leave, I gave him the instructions myself. All I know is he didn't show up. Somebody's head'll fall. Gerard's fit to be tied... You're right. Why don't you broadcast our plans. You're as upset as if you had to spend another winter in Russia. Shut up. Get Lokin. He drove Gordon to the station. Looks like trouble. Gordon didn't show up. Didn't show up? I, drove him to the San Francisco train myself. - Well, tell it to Martin. - 'Hey, mister.' Where is Mr. Martin? - Why? - I found this in the trash. Looks like it belongs to one of your games. And I know you cant get parts anymore. How about a reward? There's something more important at this moment than Gordon. Thought you would be interested in that. A plate for American money. I was right about him. [clattering] I'm top man here now. I'm gonna introduce you to some fellows with shining badges. Our arrest means you go back to prison and the death of your mother. I thought of that. Don't move! Sorry there wasn't more sugar in that coffee. Just like there aren't any cartridges in that gun. [clattering] [dramatic music] [thud] [music continues] Lunt, Bergen, go after him. [music continues] [water splashing] [water splashing] [splashing continues] [music continues] [music continues] (Helen) Wait! What's happened? Run. Get out of here. Just a minute, you. Let me go. Help! Hel.. Operator, operator! What's the matter with that call? Willow Creek, 491. It's urgent! That's my mother. - Oh, so she's in it too, huh? - Give me the gun. No. I got better idea. Take 'em in there. Come on, you. Hello? Yes, this is Hilda. Are you alone? Yes, I'm alone. Take care of the woman immediately. The rest of your instructions are the same. I, I understand. Operator. Operator! 'Please trace that call.' (male #2) 'You're one of the Gestapo too?' I'm a German of the New Order. My allegiance is to my Fuhrer. You, whom he will soon destroy, will not make me talk. You may kill me, but I will not talk! Said enough already. I've got it. Joyland Arcade, near Los Angeles. This is the Los Angeles operator. Hold the wire. Fine, thanks. Well, my hunch was right. They've spotted them at the Joyland Arcade. This is the hotspot. Set the fuel. We'll wait in the car, give us one minute. Better hurry, these fumes will seep out. [siren wailing] [siren wailing] [dramatic music] Where are you going? You stay here with us. I insist upon my rights, take me to the police station. Let's turn this place inside out. Take me outta here or we'll all be blown up. - What do you mean? - Fuels. - Where? - In there. - Where is it? - In the closet. [dramatic music] [thud] [gunshots] They've made this place into a blockbuster. Smash that window. Get those doors open. [glass shattering] [gunshots] Calling all cars. Check black sedan. License number 9Q816. Do not approach, but keep us informed of it's route. Notify all control men and auxiliary policemen. That is all. Black sedan 9Q816. Travelling east. Just crossed Sycamore. Moving toward Wilmington. Moving toward Wilmington. Start to converge. Use extreme caution. Converge with caution. We need you, identification. Officer, the handcuffs. Oh, please, do you have to? Oh, I don't think he'll need these. Well, thanks. Okay. They're driving into the Harbert Oil Refinery. There's our refinery. Let's go. You stay here and wait for news. I know you've been waiting, sir, but it's impossible to interrupt. Mr. Domack now. It's his first board meeting. And being the new chairman, I hope you understand. All I understand is, you're gonna tell him we're here, or we're going in without you. Oh, please just-just sit down, I'll try. (Domack) You understand, gentlemen, that having the majority interest I'm in the position to make the necessary personnel changes to place this plant on a complete war footing. Excuse me. Show them my private office. If you'll excuse me for just a moment. Unexpected visitors. Uh, make yourselves comfortable. We've been found out. By now the arcade is in ruins. - How? - That counterfeiter. There's no time to explain. This place must go. So he had more than a sense of humor. But why should I be suspected? You know my standing in the community. - You've lost your head. - You may lose yours. I would not like to face the Gestapo if this plant functions. Well, what can I do? What can we all do? A blueprint of the plant. The vital points are circled. These are executive passes. They'll get you through the guards, into the main plant. I'll dismiss the board. We'll meet outside the main gate in 20 minutes. Check your watch, 4:08. Right. [car approaching] You take care of this switch. These on the end of the balcony on the platform. That'll open the pipelines. I'll make for this tower. You two must cover me. See that I get there. See, there it is, the safety valve. After I force it, we'll have less than four minutes to get out. And if we don't, the plant is gone. Study it carefully, so that you each know exactly where to go. It's most regrettable, but an emergency has risen which compels me to request the adjournment of the meeting. I'm sorry to interrupt you, gentlemen. - Which one is Mr. Domack? - I am. This plant is in danger of sabotage. Impossible. No one can enter the plant property without credentials. I'll call the superintendent. [phone dialing] This man was at Gerard's. He doesn't answer. I'll go and get him. I'd recognize those cigars any place. Cigars? Why, these are Domack's. They're his special brand. - Stop him! - Come back here! Take your hands off of me.. - Put the cuff's on him. - There's Martin and the rest. Hey, Luther, get that man! Let me go. What are you trying to do? [dramatic music] [gunshots] [gunshot] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [gunshot] A-a-ah! [intense music] [aircraft engine sputtering] I know how you feel. Thought I'd hold the news, but here it is. 'You'll soon get the opportunity to be pitching yourself.' 'Some very important people in Washington' 'have interested themselves in your case.' Thanks. At first sight.. At second sight for me. And I still love waltzing to Mendelssohn. - That is a date. - I'll be waiting. If you're even thinking of standing me up I'll break your neck.
